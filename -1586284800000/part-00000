They traditionally speak the [[Khoekhoe language|Nama language]] of the [[Khoe languages|Khoe-Kwadi]] language family, although many Nama also speak [[Afrikaans]]. The Nama People (or Nama-Khoe people) are the largest group of the [[Khoikhoi]] people, most of whom have largely disappeared as a group, except for the Namas. Many of the Nama clans live in Central Namibia and the other smaller groups live in [[Namaqualand]], which today straddles the Namibian border with South Africa.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 105-DSWA0093, Deutsch-S\u00fcdwestafrika, Namafamilie.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Nama group in front of a hut]]\n[[File:Kaptain hendrik wittboi mit seinem stabe.jpg|thumbnail|left|250px|Chief ''[[Hendrik Witbooi (Namaqua chief)|Hendrik Witbooi]]'' (centre) and his companions]]\nFor thousands of years, the [[Khoisan]] peoples of South Africa and southern Namibia maintained a [[nomad]]ic life, the [[Khoikhoi]] as pastoralists and the [[San people]] as hunter-gatherers. The Nama are a Khoikhoi group. The Nama originally lived around the [[Orange River]] in southern Namibia and northern South Africa. The early colonialists referred to them as [[Khoikhoi|Hottentots]]. Their alternative historical name, \"Namaqua\", stems from the addition of the [[Khoekhoe language]] suffix ''\"-qua/khwa\"'', meaning \"people\" (found in the names of other Southern African nations like the [[Griqua people|Griqua]]), to the language name.\n\nFrom 1904 to 1908, the German Empire, which had colonised present-day [[Namibia]], waged a war against the Nama and the [[Herero people|Herero]] (a group of Bantu pastoralists), leading to the [[Herero and Namaqua genocide]] and a large loss of life for both the Nama and Herero populations.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=The Herero genocide: German unity, settlers, soldiers, and ideas\n|url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/4844/ASC-1293873-017.pdf?sequence=1 |accessdate=17 January 2014}} \"When the war finally ended in 1908 no less than 80% of the Herero had lost their lives.

If they agree they will advise him of the customs to ask the bride's family and then accompany him to the place she lives. The yard at the bride's living place is prepared prior to the future husband's family's arrival, animal hides are laid out in the corners for the different groups to sit down and discuss.<ref name=wedding>{{cite news\n|title=Love, traditionally \u2013 a \u01c0Hai\u01c0Khaua wedding\n|last=Sasman\n|first=Catherine\n|newspaper=[[New Era (Namibia)|New Era]]\n|date=3 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe groom's family ask for the gate to be opened. If this is granted, the groom is interrogated about details of the bride, including the circumstances of their first meeting and how to identify her body marks to make sure both know each other well. If the bride is pregnant or already has children from her future husband or someone else, the bride is subjected to the \"door cleansing\" ceremony (slaughtering and consuming a snow-white goat). After several days the wedding ritual continues in reverse; the bride's family visits the clan of the groom. If all is to the satisfaction of the two clans, an engagement day is announced.<ref name=wedding/>\n\nAt the engagement, the groom's family brings live animals to the woman's family home. The animals are slaughtered, hung on three sticks, and each part is offered to the bride's family. Other items like bags of sugar or flour are only offered in quantities of two or four to indicate that there will always be abundance of food. This process is also celebrated in reverse at the man's family home. White flags are mounted on both families' houses which may not be taken off but wither or are blown off by the wind one day.<ref name=wedding/>\n\nThe wedding preparations can take up to one year. The family of the groom makes a gift to the bride's mother, traditionally a cow and a calf, for she has raised the bride at her breast. A bargaining process accompanies the gift that can take weeks in itself. On wedding day, both families provide animals and other food and bring it to the bride's home. The wedding itself takes place in a church. Festivities afterward go on for several days. The first night after the wedding the couple spends separately. On the next morning, they set off for their own home.<ref name=wedding/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Democratic Action for Namas]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Literature==\n*Hoernl\u00e9\u201a A.

The majority of the Nama people in [[Namibia]] today are therefore Christian while [[Islam in Namibia|Nama Muslim]]s make up a large percentage of the Namibia's Muslims.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.islamonline.net/?p=18129|title=Islam in Namibia, making an impact|publisher=Islamonline.net}}</ref>\n\n===Wedding ritual===\n[[File:White flag in yard.jpg|thumb|A house in Windhoek's Hochland Park suburb. The white flag indicates marriage arrangements are in place.]]\n\nNamas have a complicated wedding ritual. First the man has to discuss his intentions with his family. If they agree they will advise him of the customs to ask the bride's family and then accompany him to the place she lives. The yard at the bride's living place is prepared prior to the future husband's family's arrival, animal hides are laid out in the corners for the different groups to sit down and discuss.<ref name=wedding>{{cite news\n|title=Love, traditionally \u2013 a \u01c0Hai\u01c0Khaua wedding\n|last=Sasman\n|first=Catherine\n|newspaper=[[New Era (Namibia)|New Era]]\n|date=3 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe groom's family ask for the gate to be opened. If this is granted, the groom is interrogated about details of the bride, including the circumstances of their first meeting and how to identify her body marks to make sure both know each other well. If the bride is pregnant or already has children from her future husband or someone else, the bride is subjected to the \"door cleansing\" ceremony (slaughtering and consuming a snow-white goat). After several days the wedding ritual continues in reverse; the bride's family visits the clan of the groom. If all is to the satisfaction of the two clans, an engagement day is announced.<ref name=wedding/>\n\nAt the engagement, the groom's family brings live animals to the woman's family home. The animals are slaughtered, hung on three sticks, and each part is offered to the bride's family. Other items like bags of sugar or flour are only offered in quantities of two or four to indicate that there will always be abundance of food. This process is also celebrated in reverse at the man's family home. White flags are mounted on both families' houses which may not be taken off but wither or are blown off by the wind one day.<ref name=wedding/>\n\nThe wedding preparations can take up to one year. The family of the groom makes a gift to the bride's mother, traditionally a cow and a calf, for she has raised the bride at her breast. A bargaining process accompanies the gift that can take weeks in itself. On wedding day, both families provide animals and other food and bring it to the bride's home. The wedding itself takes place in a church. Festivities afterward go on for several days. The first night after the wedding the couple spends separately. On the next morning, they set off for their own home.<ref name=wedding/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Democratic Action for Namas]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Literature==\n*Hoernl\u00e9\u201a A.

The recorded company wrote the following lines about the album: \"The ninth album The Garden Of Emotions presents symphonic themes with choirs, analog and digital synthesizers dominating. Fans of classic VANGELIS, Jean-Michel JARRE and Rick WAKEMAN works will enjoy this. Some of the more solemn themes remind Isao TOMITA. \"Lumine Solis\" is one of the best compositions and a choir-laden track. \"Solar Energy\" introduces a spacier atmosphere, with phasing pads and Berlin School sequences. This is pure electronic music and a very good one, with all sorts of really fat analog timbres. \"Beyond The Mountains\" is a very cinematic and return to the classically inspired structures, with an extra ethnic elements. \"Electric Light\" is synthetic and even KRAFTWERK-like, with insisting sequences, vocoders and a simple repeating melodic theme. Flutes, marimba sound and percussion welcome the coming of \"Savage\" before a melodic synthesizers theme appears. \"Space Station\" is another foray into a purely synthetic world and you could also draw a comparison with Jean-Michel JARRE's \"Chronologie\". \"The Canyon Of Hope\" finishes this album with flowing synthesizers, symphonic textures and a reflective electric piano\".<ref name=\"Garden\"/>\n\nIn the same year Fritsch was also honored on the Journey of Literature event in the Passo Fundo city, Brazil.

The recorded company wrote the following lines about the album: \"The ninth album The Garden Of Emotions presents symphonic themes with choirs, analog and digital synthesizers dominating. Fans of classic VANGELIS, Jean-Michel JARRE and Rick WAKEMAN works will enjoy this. Some of the more solemn themes remind Isao TOMITA. \"Lumine Solis\" is one of the best compositions and a choir-laden track. \"Solar Energy\" introduces a spacier atmosphere, with phasing pads and Berlin School sequences. This is pure electronic music and a very good one, with all sorts of really fat analog timbres. \"Beyond The Mountains\" is a very cinematic and return to the classically inspired structures, with an extra ethnic elements. \"Electric Light\" is synthetic and even KRAFTWERK-like, with insisting sequences, vocoders and a simple repeating melodic theme. Flutes, marimba sound and percussion welcome the coming of \"Savage\" before a melodic synthesizers theme appears. \"Space Station\" is another foray into a purely synthetic world and you could also draw a comparison with Jean-Michel JARRE's \"Chronologie\". \"The Canyon Of Hope\" finishes this album with flowing synthesizers, symphonic textures and a reflective electric piano\".<ref name=\"Garden\"/>\n\nIn the same year Fritsch was also honored on the Journey of Literature event in the Passo Fundo city, Brazil.

Although many derailments are minor, all result in temporary disruption of the proper operation of the railway system and they are potentially seriously hazardous to human health and safety. Usually, the derailment of a train can be caused by a collision with another object, an operational error, the mechanical failure of tracks, such as broken rails, or the mechanical failure of the wheels. In emergency situations, deliberate derailment with [[derail]]s or [[catch points]] is sometimes used to prevent a more serious accident.<!--See causes below-->\n\n== History ==\n{{expand section|date=January 2015}}\n\nRailroad wrecks in the 19th century were sensational, and the newspapers claimed them to be due to human failure or the consequence of corporate greed. It took railroads several decades to improve train-control practices and adopt safety devices sufficient to make railroad travel truly safe. Very few passengers were killed in train wrecks in the US before 1853. The early trains ran slowly and made short trips, night travel was rare, and there were not many of them in operation. While trains were convenient for travel and for transporting goods, they had become a greater danger over the years as their speed had increased. While fatal railway accidents occurred about once a year previously, there was a sudden 800 percent increase in accidents in 1853. Some railroad accidents were caused by [[human error]], but other causes included derailment, explosions on board, equipment failures, and bridge collapses. Thereafter, the rate of accidents returned to its former level.\n\nBoiler explosions had been noted in locomotive-type fire tube boilers when the top of the firebox (called the crown sheet) failed. This had to be covered with a significant layer of water at all times or the heat of the fire would weaken it to the point of failure, even at normal working pressures. Low water levels in the boiler when traversing a significant grade could expose parts of the crown sheet. Even a well-maintained firebox could fail explosively if the water level in the boiler was allowed to fall far enough to leave the top plate of the firebox uncovered. Due to the constant expansion and contraction of the firebox a form of \"stress corrosion\" could also take place at the ends of the firebox plates. This corrosion was accelerated by poor water quality and the build-up of boiler scale. A fuel explosion within the confines of the firebox (actually the ignition of unburned gases caused by an inappropriate air/fuel mixture) could also damage the pressurized boiler tubes and interior shell, potentially triggering a structural failure. The majority of locomotive explosions were found to be related to these circumstances, and constant attention to the engine was found to be the best defense against catastrophe.\n\nOn 6 January 1853, the Boston & Maine express, traveling from Boston to Lawrence, MA, derailed at forty miles per hour when an axle broke, and the single coach went down an embankment breaking in two. Only one person was killed, the eleven-year-old son of President-elect Franklin Pierce, who was also on board but was only badly bruised. A few days later, on 23 January 1853, at Glen Rock, PA, the conductor B.A. Stells was lost after the caboose was detached from its train cars in a forest during a blizzard. The body of the man and the car were not found until Spring. On 6 May 1853, a New Haven Railroad train ran through an open drawbridge at Norwalk, CT and plunged into the Norwalk River. Forty-six passengers were crushed to death or drowned. This was the first major railroad drawbridge accident. \n\nOn 17 July 1856, at Fort Washington, PA, there was one of the most infamous train wrecks to ever occur in the US and the deadliest in the world up to that time. Known as the Great Train Wreck, two North Pennsylvania Railroad trains, one of them carrying 1,500 Sunday School children to a picnic, collided. Upon impact, the boiler of the passenger train exploded and the train carrying the children derailed. Fifty-nine people were instantly killed, and dozens more died from their injuries. The conductor of the passenger train committed suicide the same day, although he was later absolved of any responsibility. \n\nFinally in this sampling, on 11 May 1858, at Utica, NY, two New York Central trains, a westbound freight and the eastbound Cincinnati Express, passed on parallel tracks on a forty-foot wooden trestle over Sauquoit Creek. It collapsed under their combined weight, utterly destroying the passenger train, killing nine and injuring 55 persons.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Volo|first1=James M.|title=Railroad Raiders of the Civil War|date=2016|publisher=CreateSpace|location=Charleston, SC|page=26-27}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 19th century derailments were commonplace, but progressively improved safety measures have resulted in a stable lower level of such incidents. In the US, derailments have dropped dramatically since 1980 from over 3,000 annually (1980) to 1,000 or so in 1986, to about 500 in 2010.<ref name = bibel>George D Bibel, ''Train Wreck \u2013 the Forensics of Rail Disasters'', Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-4214-0590-2}}</ref><ref name = wu>Huimin Wu and Nicholas Wilson, ''Railway Vehicle Derailment and Prevention'', in ''Handbook of Railway Vehicle Dynamics''</ref>\n\n== Causes ==\n[[File:British Rail Class 165 165124 derailed at Paddington, 2016.jpg|thumb|A derailed [[British Rail Class 165]] at [[London Paddington station]].

Some advanced track structures support the rails on a concrete or asphalt slab. The running surface of the rails is required to be practically continuous and of the proper geometrical layout.\n\nIn the event of a '''broken or cracked rail''', the rail running surface may be disrupted if a piece has fallen out, or become lodged in an incorrect location, or if a large gap between the remaining rail sections arises. 170 broken (not cracked) rails were reported on Network Rail in the UK in 2008, down from a peak of 988 in 1998/1999.\n\n* In [[jointed track]], rails are usually connected with bolted [[fishplate]]s (joint bars). The web of the rail experiences large [[shear force]]s and these are enhanced around the bolt hole. Where track maintenance is poor, [[Fatigue (material)|metallurgical fatigue]] can result in the propagation of star cracking from the bolthole. In extreme situations this can lead to a triangular piece of rail at the joint becoming detached.\n* Metallurgical changes take place due to the phenomenon of gauge corner cracking (in which fatigue microcracking propagates faster than ordinary wear), and also due to the effects of [[hydrogen embrittlement|hydrogen inclusion]] during the manufacturing process, leading to [[crack propagation]] under fatigue loading.\n* Local embrittlement of the parent metal may take place due to wheel spin (traction units rotating driving wheels without movement along the track).\n* Rail welds (where rail sections are joined by welding) may fail due to poor workmanship; this may be triggered by extremely cold weather or improper stressing of continuously welded rails, such that high tensile forces are generated in the rails.\n* The fishplates (joint bars) in jointed track may fail, allowing the rails to pull apart in extremely cold weather; this is usually associated with uncorrected rail creep.\n\nDerailment may take place due to excessive '''gauge widening''' (sometimes known as '''road spread'''), in which the sleepers or other fastenings fail to maintain the proper gauge. In lightly engineered track where rails are spiked (dogged) to timber sleepers, spike hold failure may result in rotation outwards of a rail, usually under the aggravating action of crabbing of bogies (trucks) on curves.<ref name = wu/>\n\nThe mechanism of gauge widening is usually gradual and relatively slow, but if it is undetected, the final failure often takes place under the effect of some additional factor, such as excess speed, poorly maintained running gear on a vehicle, misalignment of rails, and extreme traction effects (such as high propelling forces). The crabbing effect referred to above is more marked in dry conditions, when the coefficient of friction at the wheel to rail interface is high.\n\n=== Defective wheels ===\nThe running gear \u2014 [[Wheelset (rail transport)|wheelsets]], [[bogie]]s (trucks), and suspension  \u2014 may fail. The most common historical failure mode is collapse of plain bearings due to deficient lubrication, and failure of leaf springs; wheel tyres are also prone to failure due to metallurgical crack propagation.\n\nModern technologies have reduced the incidence of these failures considerably, both by design (specially the elimination of plain bearings) and intervention (non-destructive testing in service).\n\n=== Unusual track interaction ===\nIf a vertical, lateral, or crosslevel irregularity is cyclic and takes place at a wavelength corresponding to the natural frequency of certain vehicles traversing the route section, there is a risk of [[resonance|resonant]] [[harmonic oscillation]] in the vehicles, leading to extreme improper movement and possibly derailment. This is most hazardous when a cyclic roll is set up by crosslevel variations, but vertical cyclical errors also can result in vehicles lifting off the track; this is especially the case when the vehicles are in the tare (empty) condition, and if the suspension is not designed to have appropriate characteristics. The last condition applies if the suspension springing has a stiffness optimised for the loaded condition, or for a compromise loading condition, so that it is too stiff in the tare situation.\n\nThe vehicle wheelsets become momentarily unloaded vertically so that the guidance required from the flanges or wheel tread contact is inadequate.\n\nA special case is heat related '''buckling''': in hot weather the rail steel expands. This is managed by stressing continuously welded rails (they are tensioned mechanically to be stress neutral at a moderate temperature) and by providing proper expansion gaps at joints and ensuring that fishplates are properly lubricated. In addition, lateral restraint is provided by an adequate ballast shoulder. If any of these measures are inadequate, the track may buckle; a large lateral distortion takes place, which trains are unable to negotiate. (In nine years 2000/1 to 2008/9 there were 429 track buckle incidents in Great Britain).<ref group = note>On Network Rail, so excluding certain \"Metro\" networks.</ref><ref name = cummersdale>Rail Accident Investigation Board (UK), ''Derailment of a Train at Cummersdale, Cumbria, 1 June 2009'', Derby, England, 2010</ref>\n\n=== Improper operation of control systems ===\nJunctions and other changes of routing on railways are generally made by means of points (switches \u2014 movable sections capable of changing the onward route of vehicles). In the early days of railways these were moved independently by local staff. Accidents \u2014 usually collisions \u2014 took place when staff forgot which route the points were set for, or overlooked the approach of a train on a conflicting route. If the points were not correctly set for either route \u2014 set in mid-stroke \u2014 it is possible for a train passing to derail.\n\nThe first concentration of levers for signals and points brought together for operation was at Bricklayer's Arms Junction in south-east London in the period 1843\u20131844. The signal control location (forerunner of the signalbox) was enhanced by the provision of interlocking (preventing a clear signal being set for a route that was not available) in 1856.<ref name = solomon>Brian Solomon, ''Railroad Signaling'', Voyageur Press, Minneapolis, MN, 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-7603-1360-2}}</ref>\n\nTo prevent the unintended movement of freight vehicles from sidings to running lines, and other analogous improper movements, trap points and derails are provided at the exit from the sidings. In some cases these are provided at the convergence of running lines. It occasionally happens that a driver incorrectly believes s/he has authority to proceed over the trap points, or that the signaller improperly gives such permission; this results in derailment. The resulting derailment does not always fully protect the other line: a trap point derailment at speed may well result in considerable damage and obstruction, and even a single vehicle may obstruct the clear line.\n\n=== Derailment following collision ===\nIf a train collides with a massive object, it is clear that derailment of the proper running of vehicle wheels on the track may take place. Although very large obstructions are imagined, it has been known for a cow [[estray|straying]] on to the line to derail a passenger train at speed such as occurred in the [[Polmont rail accident]].\n\nThe most common obstructions encountered are '''road vehicles at level crossings''' (grade crossings); malicious persons sometimes place materials on the rails, and in some cases relatively small objects cause a derailment by guiding one wheel over the rail (rather than by gross collision).\n\nDerailment has also been brought about in situations of war or other conflict, such as during hostility by Native Americans, and more especially during periods when military personnel and materiel<!----this is the correct spelling----> was being moved by rail.<ref name = denevi>Don DeNevi and Bob Hall, ''United States Military Railway Service America's Soldier Railroaders in WWII'', 1992, Boston Mills Press, Erin, Ontario, {{ISBN|1-55046-021-8}}.</ref><ref name = wolmar>Christian Wolmar, ''Engines Of War: How Wars Were Won & Lost On The Railways'', Atlantic Books, 2010, {{ISBN|978-1-84887-172-4}}</ref><ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/tcrr-tribes/ American Experience: Native Americans and the Transcontinental Railroad]</ref>\n\n=== Harsh train handling ===\nThe handling of a train can also cause derailments. The vehicles of a train are connected by couplings; in the early days{{when|date=January 2015}} of railways these were short lengths of chain (\"loose couplings\") that connected adjacent vehicles with considerable slack. Even with later improvements there may be a considerable slack between the traction situation (power unit pulling the couplings tight), and power unit braking (locomotive applying brakes and compressing buffers throughout the train). This results in '''coupling surge'''.\n\nMore sophisticated technologies in use nowadays generally employ couplings that have no loose slack, although there is elastic movement at the couplings; continuous braking is provided, so that every vehicle on the train has brakes controlled by the driver. Generally this uses compressed air as a control medium, and there is a measurable time lag as the signal (to apply or release brakes) propagates along the train.\n\nIf a train driver applies the train brakes suddenly and severely, the front part of the train is subject to braking forces first. (Where only the locomotive has braking, this effect is obviously more extreme). The rear part of the train may overrun the front part, and in cases where coupling condition is imperfect, the resultant sudden closing up (an effect referred to as a \"run-in\") may result in a vehicle in tare condition (an empty freight vehicle) being lifted momentarily, and leaving the track.\n\nThis effect was relatively common in the nineteenth century.<ref name = cole>Colin Cole, ''Longitudinal Train Dynamics'', in ''Handbook of Railway Vehicle Dynamics''</ref>\n\nOn curved sections, the longitudinal (traction or braking) forces between vehicles have a component inward or outward respectively on the curve. In extreme situations these lateral forces may be enough to encourage derailment.\n\nA special case of train handling problems is '''overspeed on sharp curves'''. This generally arises when a driver fails to slow the train for a sharp curved section in a route that otherwise has higher speed conditions. In the extreme this results in the train entering a curve at a speed at which it cannot negotiate the curve, and gross derailment takes place. It takes roughly 6.976&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;N to completely derail a train traveling at such circumstances. The specific mechanism of this may involve bodily tipping (rotation) but is likely to involve disruption of the track structure and derailment as the primary failure event, followed by overturning.\n\nAn example of speeding on a curve would be the May [[2015 Philadelphia train derailment]] involving an Amtrak train traveling at 106&nbsp;mph (171&nbsp;km/h), twice the maximum allowable speed of 50&nbsp;mph (80&nbsp;km/h).\n\n=== Flange climbing ===\nThe guidance system of practical railway vehicles relies on the steering effect of the conicity of the wheel treads on moderate curves (down to a radius of about 500&nbsp;m, or about 1,500&nbsp;feet). On sharper curves flange contact takes place, and the guiding effect of the flange relies on a vertical force (the vehicle weight).\n\nA '''flange climbing''' derailment can result if the relationship between these forces, L/V, is excessive. The lateral force L results not only from centrifugal effects, but a large component is from the crabbing of a wheelset which has a non-zero angle of attack during running with flange contact. The L/V excess can result from wheel unloading, or from improper rail or wheel tread profiles. The physics of this is more fully described below, in the section ''wheel-rail interaction''.\n\nWheel unloading can be caused by '''twist''' in the track. This can arise if the cant (crosslevel, or superelevation) of the track varies considerably over the wheelbase of a vehicle, and the vehicle suspension is very stiff in torsion. In the quasi-static situation it may arise in extreme cases of poor load distribution, or on extreme cant at low speed.\n\nIf a rail has been subject to extreme sidewear, or a wheel flange has been worn to an improper angle, it is possible for the L/V ratio to exceed the value that the flange angle can resist.\n\nIf weld repair of side-worn switches is undertaken, it is possible for poor workmanship to produce a ramp in the profile in the facing direction, that deflects an approaching wheel flange on to the rail head.\n\nIn extreme situations, the infrastructure may be grossly distorted or even absent; this may arise from earthworks movement (embankment slips and washouts), earthquake and other major terrestrial disruption, deficient protection during work processes etc.\n\n==== Wheel-rail interaction ====\n\nNearly all practical railway systems use wheels fixed to a common axle: the wheels on both sides rotate in unison. Tramcars requiring low floor levels are the exception, but much benefit in vehicle guidance is lost by having unlinked wheels.<ref name = ayasse>Jean-Bernard Ayasse and Hugues Chollet, ''Wheel\u2014Rail Contact'', in ''Handbook of Railway Dynamics''</ref>\n\nThe benefit of linked wheels derives from the '''conicity of the wheel treads'''\u2014the wheel treads are not [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]], but [[cone|conical]].<ref name = bibel/><ref name = ayasse/> On idealised straight track, a wheelset would run centrally, midway between the rails.\n\nThe example shown here uses a right-curving section of track.  The focus is on the left-side wheel, which is more involved with the forces critical to guiding the railcar through the curve.\n\nDiagram 1 below shows the wheel and rail with the wheelset running straight and central on the track. The wheelset is running away from the observer. (Note that the rail is shown inclined inwards; this is done on modern track to match the rail head profile to the wheel tread profile.)\n\nDiagram 2 shows the wheelset displaced to the left, due to curvature of the track or a geometrical irregularity.  The left wheel (shown here) is now running on a slightly larger diameter; the right wheel opposite has moved to the left as well, towards the centre of the track, and is running on a slightly smaller diameter. As the two wheels rotate at the same rate, the forward speed of the left wheel is a little faster than the forward speed of the right wheel. This causes the wheelset to curve to the right, correcting the displacement. This takes place without flange contact; the wheelsets  steer themselves on moderate curves without any flange contact.\n\nThe sharper the curve, the greater the lateral displacement necessary to achieve the curving. On a very sharp curve (typically less than about 500&nbsp;m or 1,500&nbsp;feet radius) the width of the wheel tread is not enough to achieve the necessary steering effect, and the wheel flange contacts the face of the high rail.<ref group = note>The high rail is considered to be the outer rail in a curve; the low rail is the inner rail.</ref>\n\nDiagram 3 shows the running of wheelsets in a bogie or a four-wheeled vehicle. The wheelset is not running parallel to the track: it is constrained by the bogie frame and suspension, and it is yawing to the outside of the curve; that is, its natural rolling direction would lead along a less sharply curved path than the actual curve of the track.<ref group = note>Yaw describes the situation when the longitudinal axis of the wheelset is not the same as the longitudinal axis of motion.</ref>\n\nThe angle between the natural path and the actual path is called the '''angle of attack''' (or the yaw angle). As the wheelset rolls forward, it is forced to slide across the railhead by the flange contact. The whole wheelset is forced to do this, so the wheel on the low rail is also forced to slide across its rail.<ref group = note>This was understood as early as 1844, when Robert Stephenson gave evidence that \"in bringing round the curve, the wheels will all be fixed on the axles, and being of the same size, of course the outside has to go over more ground than the inside and therefore the outside ones slide upon the turn, and consequently, as you see in the Bristol stations [where broad gauge trains were negotiating sharp curves], you will see such wheels grind in their operation.\" Stephenson was giving evidence in the House of Commons regarding the South Devon Railway bill, on 26 April 1844, quoted in Hugh Howes, ''The Struggle for the South Devon Railway'', Twelveheads Press, Chacewater, 2012, {{ISBN|978 0 906294 74 1}}</ref>\n\nThis sliding requires a considerable force to make it happen, and the friction force resisting the sliding is designated \"L\", the lateral force. The wheelset applies a force L outwards to the rails, and the rails apply a force L inwards to the wheels. Note that this is quite independent of \"centrifugal force\".<ref group = note>Centrifugal force is a convenient imaginary concept; strictly speaking it is the inertia of a body being accelerated, equal to the product of the mass of the body and the acceleration.</ref> However at higher speeds the centrifugal force is added to the friction force to make L.\n\nThe load (vertical force) on the outer wheel is designated V, so that in Diagram 4 the two forces L and V are shown.\n\nThe steel-to-steel contact has a [[coefficient of friction]] that may be as high as 0.5 in dry conditions, so that the lateral force may be up to 0.5 of the vertical wheel load.<ref group = note>The value of L is determined by the load on both wheels of the wheelset multiplied by the coefficient of friction, plus the centrifugal force. But the sliding on the wheel on the low rail is not lateral -- the wheel tread is actually sliding backwards (i.e rotating less rapidly than the forward speed requires) and the lateral friction force generated is limited by the vector of the sliding action.</ref>\n\nDuring this flange contact, the wheel on the high rail is experiencing the lateral force L, towards the outside of the curve. As the wheel rotates, the flange tends to climb up the flange angle. It is held down by the vertical load on the wheel V, so that if L/V exceeds the trigonometrical tangent of the flange contact angle, climbing will take place. The wheel flange will climb to the rail head where there is no lateral resistance in rolling movement, and a '''flange climbing derailment''' usually takes place. In Diagram 5 the flange contact angle is quite steep, and flange climbing is unlikely. However, if the rail head is side-worn (side-cut) or the flange is worn, as shown in Diagram 6 the contact angle is much flatter and flange climbing is more likely.<ref name = wu/><ref name = ayasse/>\n\nOnce the wheel flange has completely climbed onto the rail head, there is no lateral restraint, and the wheelset is likely to follow the yaw angle, resulting in the wheel dropping outside the rail. An L/V ratio greater than 0.6 is considered to be hazardous.<ref name = bibel/>\n\nIt is emphasised that this is a much simplified description of the physics; complicating factors are creep, actual wheel and rail profiles, dynamic effects, stiffness of longitudinal restraint at axleboxes, and the lateral component of longitudinal (traction and braking) forces.<ref name = cole/>\n\n{{gallery |align=center |title=Wheel-rail interactions\n|File:Wheel and rail central running.gif|Diagram 1: Wheel tread and rail during central running\n|File:Wheel and rail displaced running.gif|Diagram 2: Wheel and rail with wheel displaced to the left\n|File:Bogie in yaw.gif|Diagram 3: Bogie and wheelset in a right-turning curve\n|File:L over V.gif|Diagram 4: L and V forces in curving\n|File:Wheel and rail flange climbing.gif|Diagram 5: Wheel and rail during flange climbing\n|File:Worn wheel and rail flange climbing.gif|Diagram 6: Worn wheel and rail during flange climbing\n}}\n\n== Rerailing ==\n[[File:Locomotive derailed 2055744.jpg|thumb|A derailed [[British Rail]] (EX. [[London and North Eastern Railway|London North Eastern Railway]]) B1 being lifted back onto the tracks by a rail crane in 1951]]\n[[File:Broken rail derailment.jpg|thumb|Rerailing a locomotive using a rerailer and wooden blocks after a broken rail derailment]]\n\nFollowing a derailment, it is naturally necessary to replace the vehicle on the track. If there is no significant track damage, that may be all that is needed. However, when trains in normal running derail at speed, a considerable length of track may be damaged or destroyed; far worse secondary damage may be caused if a bridge is encountered.\n\nWith simple wagon derailments where the final position is close to the proper track location, it is usually possible to pull the derailed wheelsets back on to the track using rerailing ramps; these are metal blocks designed to fit over the rails and to provide a rising path back to the track. A locomotive is usually used to pull the wagon.\n\nIf the derailed vehicle is further from the track, or its configuration (such as a high centre of gravity or a very short wheelbase) make the use of ramps impossible, jacks may be used. In its crudest form, the process involves lifting the vehicle frame and then allowing it to fall off the jack towards the track. This may need to be repeated.\n\nA more sophisticated process involves a controlled process using slewing jacks in addition. Photographs of early locomotives often indicate one or more jacks carried on the frame of the locomotive for the purpose, presumed to be a frequent occurrence.\n\nWhen more complex rerailing work is needed, various combinations of cable and pulley systems may be used, or the use of one or more [[Crane (railroad)|rail-borne cranes]] to lift a locomotive bodily.<ref name = tatlow1>Peter Tatlow, ''Railway Breakdown Cranes: Volume 1'', Noodle Books, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1906419691}}</ref><ref name = tatlow2>Peter Tatlow, ''Railway Breakdown Cranes: Volume 2'', Noodle Books, 2013, {{ISBN|978-1906419974}}</ref> In special cases road cranes are used, as these have greater lifting and reach capacity, if road access to the site is feasible.\n\nIn extreme circumstances, a derailed vehicle in an awkward location may be scrapped and cut up on site, or simply abandoned as non-salvageable.\n\n== Examples ==\n''Note: there is a large list of railway accidents in general at [[Lists of rail accidents]].''\n\n[[File:Train wreck at Montparnasse 1895.jpg|thumb|right| Train derailment at Gare Montparnasse, Paris in 1895]]\n\n=== Primary mechanical failure of a track component ===\nIn the [[Hatfield rail crash]] in England in 2000, which killed four people, rolling contact fatigue had resulted in multiple gauge corner cracking in the surface; 300 such cracks were subsequently found at the site.

Although many derailments are minor, all result in temporary disruption of the proper operation of the railway system and they are potentially seriously hazardous to human health and safety. Usually, the derailment of a train can be caused by a collision with another object, an operational error, the mechanical failure of tracks, such as broken rails, or the mechanical failure of the wheels. In emergency situations, deliberate derailment with [[derail]]s or [[catch points]] is sometimes used to prevent a more serious accident.<!--See causes below-->\n\n== History ==\n{{expand section|date=January 2015}}\n\nRailroad wrecks in the 19th century were sensational, and the newspapers claimed them to be due to human failure or the consequence of corporate greed. It took railroads several decades to improve train-control practices and adopt safety devices sufficient to make railroad travel truly safe. Very few passengers were killed in train wrecks in the US before 1853. The early trains ran slowly and made short trips, night travel was rare, and there were not many of them in operation. While trains were convenient for travel and for transporting goods, they had become a greater danger over the years as their speed had increased. While fatal railway accidents occurred about once a year previously, there was a sudden 800 percent increase in accidents in 1853. Some railroad accidents were caused by [[human error]], but other causes included derailment, explosions on board, equipment failures, and bridge collapses. Thereafter, the rate of accidents returned to its former level.\n\nBoiler explosions had been noted in locomotive-type fire tube boilers when the top of the firebox (called the crown sheet) failed. This had to be covered with a significant layer of water at all times or the heat of the fire would weaken it to the point of failure, even at normal working pressures. Low water levels in the boiler when traversing a significant grade could expose parts of the crown sheet. Even a well-maintained firebox could fail explosively if the water level in the boiler was allowed to fall far enough to leave the top plate of the firebox uncovered. Due to the constant expansion and contraction of the firebox a form of \"stress corrosion\" could also take place at the ends of the firebox plates. This corrosion was accelerated by poor water quality and the build-up of boiler scale. A fuel explosion within the confines of the firebox (actually the ignition of unburned gases caused by an inappropriate air/fuel mixture) could also damage the pressurized boiler tubes and interior shell, potentially triggering a structural failure. The majority of locomotive explosions were found to be related to these circumstances, and constant attention to the engine was found to be the best defense against catastrophe.\n\nOn 6 January 1853, the Boston & Maine express, traveling from Boston to Lawrence, MA, derailed at forty miles per hour when an axle broke, and the single coach went down an embankment breaking in two. Only one person was killed, the eleven-year-old son of President-elect Franklin Pierce, who was also on board but was only badly bruised. A few days later, on 23 January 1853, at Glen Rock, PA, the conductor B.A. Stells was lost after the caboose was detached from its train cars in a forest during a blizzard. The body of the man and the car were not found until Spring. On 6 May 1853, a New Haven Railroad train ran through an open drawbridge at Norwalk, CT and plunged into the Norwalk River. Forty-six passengers were crushed to death or drowned. This was the first major railroad drawbridge accident. \n\nOn 17 July 1856, at Fort Washington, PA, there was one of the most infamous train wrecks to ever occur in the US and the deadliest in the world up to that time. Known as the Great Train Wreck, two North Pennsylvania Railroad trains, one of them carrying 1,500 Sunday School children to a picnic, collided. Upon impact, the boiler of the passenger train exploded and the train carrying the children derailed. Fifty-nine people were instantly killed, and dozens more died from their injuries. The conductor of the passenger train committed suicide the same day, although he was later absolved of any responsibility. \n\nFinally in this sampling, on 11 May 1858, at Utica, NY, two New York Central trains, a westbound freight and the eastbound Cincinnati Express, passed on parallel tracks on a forty-foot wooden trestle over Sauquoit Creek. It collapsed under their combined weight, utterly destroying the passenger train, killing nine and injuring 55 persons.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Volo|first1=James M.|title=Railroad Raiders of the Civil War|date=2016|publisher=CreateSpace|location=Charleston, SC|page=26-27}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 19th century derailments were commonplace, but progressively improved safety measures have resulted in a stable lower level of such incidents. In the US, derailments have dropped dramatically since 1980 from over 3,000 annually (1980) to 1,000 or so in 1986, to about 500 in 2010.<ref name = bibel>George D Bibel, ''Train Wreck \u2013 the Forensics of Rail Disasters'', Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-4214-0590-2}}</ref><ref name = wu>Huimin Wu and Nicholas Wilson, ''Railway Vehicle Derailment and Prevention'', in ''Handbook of Railway Vehicle Dynamics''</ref>\n\n== Causes ==\n[[File:British Rail Class 165 165124 derailed at Paddington, 2016.jpg|thumb|A derailed [[British Rail Class 165]] at [[London Paddington station]].

After derailing, the rear of the train struck a [[stanchion]], severely damaging the driver's side of the rear unit.]]\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2015}}\nDerailments result from one or more of a number of distinct causes; these may be classified as:\n\n* the primary mechanical failure of a track component (for example broken rails, gauge spread due to sleeper (tie) failure)\n* the primary mechanical failure of a component of the running gear of a vehicle (for example axlebox failure, wheel breakage)\n* a fault in the geometry of the track components or the running gear that results in a quasi-static failure in running (for example rail climbing due to excessive wear of wheels or rails, earthworks slip)\n* a dynamic effect of the track-vehicle interaction (for example extreme [[Hunting oscillation|hunting]], vertical bounce, track shift under a train, excessive speed)\n* improper operation of points, or improper observance of signals protecting them (signal errors)\n* as a secondary event following collision with other trains, road vehicles, or other obstructions ([[level crossing]] collisions, obstructions on the line)\n* train handling (snatches due to sudden traction or braking forces, referred to as slack action in North America).\n\n[[File:Off the Rails (1).jpg|thumb|A derailed locomotive unit in Australia at a [[catch point]] hidden from view (January 2007)]]\n<ref group = note>The U.S. Federal Railroad Administration categorises derailments differently, for the use of professionals in the industry; these are not completely helpful for external readers, but for completeness, the main groupings are given here:\n\n* Rail, joint bar and anchoring\n* Track geometry defect\n* General switching rules\n* Wheels\n* Axles and journal bearings\n* Switches\n* Frogs, switches and track appliances\n* Bogie (truck) components\n* Train handling / train make-up\n* Highway rail grading\n\nSource: Safety Database Analysis, Transportation Technology Center Inc, Pueblo Col, 2002, quoted in ''Wu and Wilson'', page 210-211</ref>\n\n=== Broken rails ===\n[[File:Schienenbruch.jpg|thumb|A broken rail, probably starting from [[hydrogen embrittlement|hydrogen inclusion]] in the rail head]]\nA traditional track structure consists of two rails, fixed at a designated distance apart (known as the [[track gauge]]), and supported on transverse sleepers (ties). Some advanced track structures support the rails on a concrete or asphalt slab. The running surface of the rails is required to be practically continuous and of the proper geometrical layout.\n\nIn the event of a '''broken or cracked rail''', the rail running surface may be disrupted if a piece has fallen out, or become lodged in an incorrect location, or if a large gap between the remaining rail sections arises. 170 broken (not cracked) rails were reported on Network Rail in the UK in 2008, down from a peak of 988 in 1998/1999.\n\n* In [[jointed track]], rails are usually connected with bolted [[fishplate]]s (joint bars). The web of the rail experiences large [[shear force]]s and these are enhanced around the bolt hole. Where track maintenance is poor, [[Fatigue (material)|metallurgical fatigue]] can result in the propagation of star cracking from the bolthole. In extreme situations this can lead to a triangular piece of rail at the joint becoming detached.\n* Metallurgical changes take place due to the phenomenon of gauge corner cracking (in which fatigue microcracking propagates faster than ordinary wear), and also due to the effects of [[hydrogen embrittlement|hydrogen inclusion]] during the manufacturing process, leading to [[crack propagation]] under fatigue loading.\n* Local embrittlement of the parent metal may take place due to wheel spin (traction units rotating driving wheels without movement along the track).\n* Rail welds (where rail sections are joined by welding) may fail due to poor workmanship; this may be triggered by extremely cold weather or improper stressing of continuously welded rails, such that high tensile forces are generated in the rails.\n* The fishplates (joint bars) in jointed track may fail, allowing the rails to pull apart in extremely cold weather; this is usually associated with uncorrected rail creep.\n\nDerailment may take place due to excessive '''gauge widening''' (sometimes known as '''road spread'''), in which the sleepers or other fastenings fail to maintain the proper gauge. In lightly engineered track where rails are spiked (dogged) to timber sleepers, spike hold failure may result in rotation outwards of a rail, usually under the aggravating action of crabbing of bogies (trucks) on curves.<ref name = wu/>\n\nThe mechanism of gauge widening is usually gradual and relatively slow, but if it is undetected, the final failure often takes place under the effect of some additional factor, such as excess speed, poorly maintained running gear on a vehicle, misalignment of rails, and extreme traction effects (such as high propelling forces). The crabbing effect referred to above is more marked in dry conditions, when the coefficient of friction at the wheel to rail interface is high.\n\n=== Defective wheels ===\nThe running gear \u2014 [[Wheelset (rail transport)|wheelsets]], [[bogie]]s (trucks), and suspension  \u2014 may fail. The most common historical failure mode is collapse of plain bearings due to deficient lubrication, and failure of leaf springs; wheel tyres are also prone to failure due to metallurgical crack propagation.\n\nModern technologies have reduced the incidence of these failures considerably, both by design (specially the elimination of plain bearings) and intervention (non-destructive testing in service).\n\n=== Unusual track interaction ===\nIf a vertical, lateral, or crosslevel irregularity is cyclic and takes place at a wavelength corresponding to the natural frequency of certain vehicles traversing the route section, there is a risk of [[resonance|resonant]] [[harmonic oscillation]] in the vehicles, leading to extreme improper movement and possibly derailment. This is most hazardous when a cyclic roll is set up by crosslevel variations, but vertical cyclical errors also can result in vehicles lifting off the track; this is especially the case when the vehicles are in the tare (empty) condition, and if the suspension is not designed to have appropriate characteristics. The last condition applies if the suspension springing has a stiffness optimised for the loaded condition, or for a compromise loading condition, so that it is too stiff in the tare situation.\n\nThe vehicle wheelsets become momentarily unloaded vertically so that the guidance required from the flanges or wheel tread contact is inadequate.\n\nA special case is heat related '''buckling''': in hot weather the rail steel expands. This is managed by stressing continuously welded rails (they are tensioned mechanically to be stress neutral at a moderate temperature) and by providing proper expansion gaps at joints and ensuring that fishplates are properly lubricated. In addition, lateral restraint is provided by an adequate ballast shoulder. If any of these measures are inadequate, the track may buckle; a large lateral distortion takes place, which trains are unable to negotiate. (In nine years 2000/1 to 2008/9 there were 429 track buckle incidents in Great Britain).<ref group = note>On Network Rail, so excluding certain \"Metro\" networks.</ref><ref name = cummersdale>Rail Accident Investigation Board (UK), ''Derailment of a Train at Cummersdale, Cumbria, 1 June 2009'', Derby, England, 2010</ref>\n\n=== Improper operation of control systems ===\nJunctions and other changes of routing on railways are generally made by means of points (switches \u2014 movable sections capable of changing the onward route of vehicles). In the early days of railways these were moved independently by local staff. Accidents \u2014 usually collisions \u2014 took place when staff forgot which route the points were set for, or overlooked the approach of a train on a conflicting route. If the points were not correctly set for either route \u2014 set in mid-stroke \u2014 it is possible for a train passing to derail.\n\nThe first concentration of levers for signals and points brought together for operation was at Bricklayer's Arms Junction in south-east London in the period 1843-1844. The signal control location (forerunner of the signalbox) was enhanced by the provision of interlocking (preventing a clear signal being set for a route that was not available) in 1856.<ref name = solomon>Brian Solomon, ''Railroad Signaling'', Voyageur Press, Minneapolis, MN, 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-7603-1360-2}}</ref>\n\nTo prevent the unintended movement of freight vehicles from sidings to running lines, and other analogous improper movements, trap points and derails are provided at the exit from the sidings. In some cases these are provided at the convergence of running lines. It occasionally happens that a driver incorrectly believes s/he has authority to proceed over the trap points, or that the signaller improperly gives such permission; this results in derailment. The resulting derailment does not always fully protect the other line: a trap point derailment at speed may well result in considerable damage and obstruction, and even a single vehicle may obstruct the clear line.\n\n=== Derailment following collision ===\nIf a train collides with a massive object, it is clear that derailment of the proper running of vehicle wheels on the track may take place. Although very large obstructions are imagined, it has been known for a cow [[estray|straying]] on to the line to derail a passenger train at speed such as occurred in the [[Polmont rail accident]].\n\nThe most common obstructions encountered are '''road vehicles at level crossings''' (grade crossings); malicious persons sometimes place materials on the rails, and in some cases relatively small objects cause a derailment by guiding one wheel over the rail (rather than by gross collision).\n\nDerailment has also been brought about in situations of war or other conflict, such as during hostility by Native Americans, and more especially during periods when military personnel and materiel<!----this is the correct spelling----> was being moved by rail.<ref name = denevi>Don DeNevi and Bob Hall, ''United States Military Railway Service America's Soldier Railroaders in WWII'', 1992, Boston Mills Press, Erin, Ontario, {{ISBN|1-55046-021-8}}.</ref><ref name = wolmar>Christian Wolmar, ''Engines Of War: How Wars Were Won & Lost On The Railways'', Atlantic Books, 2010, {{ISBN|978-1-84887-172-4}}</ref><ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/tcrr-tribes/ American Experience: Native Americans and the Transcontinental Railroad]</ref>\n\n=== Harsh train handling ===\nThe handling of a train can also cause derailments. The vehicles of a train are connected by couplings; in the early days{{when|date=January 2015}} of railways these were short lengths of chain (\"loose couplings\") that connected adjacent vehicles with considerable slack. Even with later improvements there may be a considerable slack between the traction situation (power unit pulling the couplings tight), and power unit braking (locomotive applying brakes and compressing buffers throughout the train). This results in '''coupling surge'''.\n\nMore sophisticated technologies in use nowadays generally employ couplings that have no loose slack, although there is elastic movement at the couplings; continuous braking is provided, so that every vehicle on the train has brakes controlled by the driver. Generally this uses compressed air as a control medium, and there is a measurable time lag as the signal (to apply or release brakes) propagates along the train.\n\nIf a train driver applies the train brakes suddenly and severely, the front part of the train is subject to braking forces first. (Where only the locomotive has braking, this effect is obviously more extreme). The rear part of the train may overrun the front part, and in cases where coupling condition is imperfect, the resultant sudden closing up (an effect referred to as a \"run-in\") may result in a vehicle in tare condition (an empty freight vehicle) being lifted momentarily, and leaving the track.\n\nThis effect was relatively common in the nineteenth century.<ref name = cole>Colin Cole, ''Longitudinal Train Dynamics'', in ''Handbook of Railway Vehicle Dynamics''</ref>\n\nOn curved sections, the longitudinal (traction or braking) forces between vehicles have a component inward or outward respectively on the curve. In extreme situations these lateral forces may be enough to encourage derailment.\n\nA special case of train handling problems is '''overspeed on sharp curves'''. This generally arises when a driver fails to slow the train for a sharp curved section in a route that otherwise has higher speed conditions. In the extreme this results in the train entering a curve at a speed at which it cannot negotiate the curve, and gross derailment takes place. It takes roughly 6.976&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;N to completely derail a train traveling at such circumstances. The specific mechanism of this may involve bodily tipping (rotation) but is likely to involve disruption of the track structure and derailment as the primary failure event, followed by overturning.\n\nAn example of speeding on a curve would be the May [[2015 Philadelphia train derailment]] involving an Amtrak train traveling at 106&nbsp;mph (171&nbsp;km/h), twice the maximum allowable speed of 50&nbsp;mph (80&nbsp;km/h).\n\n=== Flange climbing ===\nThe guidance system of practical railway vehicles relies on the steering effect of the conicity of the wheel treads on moderate curves (down to a radius of about 500&nbsp;m, or about 1,500&nbsp;feet). On sharper curves flange contact takes place, and the guiding effect of the flange relies on a vertical force (the vehicle weight).\n\nA '''flange climbing''' derailment can result if the relationship between these forces, L/V, is excessive. The lateral force L results not only from centrifugal effects, but a large component is from the crabbing of a wheelset which has a non-zero angle of attack during running with flange contact. The L/V excess can result from wheel unloading, or from improper rail or wheel tread profiles. The physics of this is more fully described below, in the section ''wheel-rail interaction''.\n\nWheel unloading can be caused by '''twist''' in the track. This can arise if the cant (crosslevel, or superelevation) of the track varies considerably over the wheelbase of a vehicle, and the vehicle suspension is very stiff in torsion. In the quasi-static situation it may arise in extreme cases of poor load distribution, or on extreme cant at low speed.\n\nIf a rail has been subject to extreme sidewear, or a wheel flange has been worn to an improper angle, it is possible for the L/V ratio to exceed the value that the flange angle can resist.\n\nIf weld repair of side-worn switches is undertaken, it is possible for poor workmanship to produce a ramp in the profile in the facing direction, that deflects an approaching wheel flange on to the rail head.\n\nIn extreme situations, the infrastructure may be grossly distorted or even absent; this may arise from earthworks movement (embankment slips and washouts), earthquake and other major terrestrial disruption, deficient protection during work processes etc.\n\n==== Wheel-rail interaction ====\n\nNearly all practical railway systems use wheels fixed to a common axle: the wheels on both sides rotate in unison. Tramcars requiring low floor levels are the exception, but much benefit in vehicle guidance is lost by having unlinked wheels.<ref name = ayasse>Jean-Bernard Ayasse and Hugues Chollet, ''Wheel\u2014Rail Contact'', in ''Handbook of Railway Dynamics''</ref>\n\nThe benefit of linked wheels derives from the '''conicity of the wheel treads'''\u2014the wheel treads are not [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]], but [[cone|conical]].<ref name = bibel/><ref name = ayasse/> On idealised straight track, a wheelset would run centrally, midway between the rails.\n\nThe example shown here uses a right-curving section of track.  The focus is on the left-side wheel, which is more involved with the forces critical to guiding the railcar through the curve.\n\nDiagram 1 below shows the wheel and rail with the wheelset running straight and central on the track. The wheelset is running away from the observer. (Note that the rail is shown inclined inwards; this is done on modern track to match the rail head profile to the wheel tread profile.)\n\nDiagram 2 shows the wheelset displaced to the left, due to curvature of the track or a geometrical irregularity.  The left wheel (shown here) is now running on a slightly larger diameter; the right wheel opposite has moved to the left as well, towards the centre of the track, and is running on a slightly smaller diameter. As the two wheels rotate at the same rate, the forward speed of the left wheel is a little faster than the forward speed of the right wheel. This causes the wheelset to curve to the right, correcting the displacement. This takes place without flange contact; the wheelsets  steer themselves on moderate curves without any flange contact.\n\nThe sharper the curve, the greater the lateral displacement necessary to achieve the curving. On a very sharp curve (typically less than about 500&nbsp;m or 1,500&nbsp;feet radius) the width of the wheel tread is not enough to achieve the necessary steering effect, and the wheel flange contacts the face of the high rail.<ref group = note>The high rail is considered to be the outer rail in a curve; the low rail is the inner rail.</ref>\n\nDiagram 3 shows the running of wheelsets in a bogie or a four-wheeled vehicle. The wheelset is not running parallel to the track: it is constrained by the bogie frame and suspension, and it is yawing to the outside of the curve; that is, its natural rolling direction would lead along a less sharply curved path than the actual curve of the track.<ref group = note>Yaw describes the situation when the longitudinal axis of the wheelset is not the same as the longitudinal axis of motion.</ref>\n\nThe angle between the natural path and the actual path is called the '''angle of attack''' (or the yaw angle). As the wheelset rolls forward, it is forced to slide across the railhead by the flange contact. The whole wheelset is forced to do this, so the wheel on the low rail is also forced to slide across its rail.<ref group = note>This was understood as early as 1844, when Robert Stephenson gave evidence that \"in bringing round the curve, the wheels will all be fixed on the axles, and being of the same size, of course the outside has to go over more ground than the inside and therefore the outside ones slide upon the turn, and consequently, as you see in the Bristol stations [where broad gauge trains were negotiating sharp curves], you will see such wheels grind in their operation.\" Stephenson was giving evidence in the House of Commons regarding the South Devon Railway bill, on 26 April 1844, quoted in Hugh Howes, ''The Struggle for the South Devon Railway'', Twelveheads Press, Chacewater, 2012, {{ISBN|978 0 906294 74 1}}</ref>\n\nThis sliding requires a considerable force to make it happen, and the friction force resisting the sliding is designated \"L\", the lateral force. The wheelset applies a force L outwards to the rails, and the rails apply a force L inwards to the wheels. Note that this is quite independent of \"centrifugal force\".<ref group = note>Centrifugal force is a convenient imaginary concept; strictly speaking it is the inertia of a body being accelerated, equal to the product of the mass of the body and the acceleration.</ref> However at higher speeds the centrifugal force is added to the friction force to make L.\n\nThe load (vertical force) on the outer wheel is designated V, so that in Diagram 4 the two forces L and V are shown.\n\nThe steel-to-steel contact has a [[coefficient of friction]] that may be as high as 0.5 in dry conditions, so that the lateral force may be up to 0.5 of the vertical wheel load.<ref group = note>The value of L is determined by the load on both wheels of the wheelset multiplied by the coefficient of friction, plus the centrifugal force. But the sliding on the wheel on the low rail is not lateral -- the wheel tread is actually sliding backwards (i.e rotating less rapidly than the forward speed requires) and the lateral friction force generated is limited by the vector of the sliding action.</ref>\n\nDuring this flange contact, the wheel on the high rail is experiencing the lateral force L, towards the outside of the curve. As the wheel rotates, the flange tends to climb up the flange angle. It is held down by the vertical load on the wheel V, so that if L/V exceeds the trigonometrical tangent of the flange contact angle, climbing will take place. The wheel flange will climb to the rail head where there is no lateral resistance in rolling movement, and a '''flange climbing derailment''' usually takes place. In Diagram 5 the flange contact angle is quite steep, and flange climbing is unlikely. However, if the rail head is side-worn (side-cut) or the flange is worn, as shown in Diagram 6 the contact angle is much flatter and flange climbing is more likely.<ref name = wu/><ref name = ayasse/>\n\nOnce the wheel flange has completely climbed onto the rail head, there is no lateral restraint, and the wheelset is likely to follow the yaw angle, resulting in the wheel dropping outside the rail. An L/V ratio greater than 0.6 is considered to be hazardous.<ref name = bibel/>\n\nIt is emphasised that this is a much simplified description of the physics; complicating factors are creep, actual wheel and rail profiles, dynamic effects, stiffness of longitudinal restraint at axleboxes, and the lateral component of longitudinal (traction and braking) forces.<ref name = cole/>\n\n{{gallery |align=center |title=Wheel-rail interactions\n|File:Wheel and rail central running.gif|Diagram 1: Wheel tread and rail during central running\n|File:Wheel and rail displaced running.gif|Diagram 2: Wheel and rail with wheel displaced to the left\n|File:Bogie in yaw.gif|Diagram 3: Bogie and wheelset in a right-turning curve\n|File:L over V.gif|Diagram 4: L and V forces in curving\n|File:Wheel and rail flange climbing.gif|Diagram 5: Wheel and rail during flange climbing\n|File:Worn wheel and rail flange climbing.gif|Diagram 6: Worn wheel and rail during flange climbing\n}}\n\n== Rerailing ==\n[[File:Locomotive derailed 2055744.jpg|thumb|A derailed [[British Rail]] (EX.

However, when trains in normal running derail at speed, a considerable length of track may be damaged or destroyed; far worse secondary damage may be caused if a bridge is encountered.\n\nWith simple wagon derailments where the final position is close to the proper track location, it is usually possible to pull the derailed wheelsets back on to the track using rerailing ramps; these are metal blocks designed to fit over the rails and to provide a rising path back to the track. A locomotive is usually used to pull the wagon.\n\nIf the derailed vehicle is further from the track, or its configuration (such as a high centre of gravity or a very short wheelbase) make the use of ramps impossible, jacks may be used. In its crudest form, the process involves lifting the vehicle frame and then allowing it to fall off the jack towards the track. This may need to be repeated.\n\nA more sophisticated process involves a controlled process using slewing jacks in addition. Photographs of early locomotives often indicate one or more jacks carried on the frame of the locomotive for the purpose, presumed to be a frequent occurrence.\n\nWhen more complex rerailing work is needed, various combinations of cable and pulley systems may be used, or the use of one or more [[Crane (railroad)|rail-borne cranes]] to lift a locomotive bodily.<ref name = tatlow1>Peter Tatlow, ''Railway Breakdown Cranes: Volume 1'', Noodle Books, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1906419691}}</ref><ref name = tatlow2>Peter Tatlow, ''Railway Breakdown Cranes: Volume 2'', Noodle Books, 2013, {{ISBN|978-1906419974}}</ref> In special cases road cranes are used, as these have greater lifting and reach capacity, if road access to the site is feasible.\n\nIn extreme circumstances, a derailed vehicle in an awkward location may be scrapped and cut up on site, or simply abandoned as non-salvageable.\n\n== Examples ==\n''Note: there is a large list of railway accidents in general at [[Lists of rail accidents]].''\n\n[[File:Train wreck at Montparnasse 1895.jpg|thumb|right| Train derailment at Gare Montparnasse, Paris in 1895]]\n\n=== Primary mechanical failure of a track component ===\nIn the [[Hatfield rail crash]] in England in 2000, which killed four people, rolling contact fatigue had resulted in multiple gauge corner cracking in the surface; 300 such cracks were subsequently found at the site.

The official report was not entirely conclusive as to the causes, but it observed that the annual total of buckling distortions was 48 in 1969, having been in single figures in every previous year, and that [heat-related] distortions per 1,000 miles per annum were 10.42 for cwr and 2.98 for jointed track in 1969, having been a maximum of 1.78 and 1.21 in the previous ten years. 90% of the distortions could be attributed to one of the following:\n* failure to comply with the instructions for laying or maintaining cwr track\n* recent interference with the consolidation of the ballast\n* the effect of discontinuities in the cwr track such as points etc.\n* extraneous factors such as formation subsidence.<ref name = buckling>[http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docsummary.php?docID=1272 Major C F Rose, ''Railway Accidents, Interim Report on the Derailments that occurred on Continuous Welded Track at Lichfield (London Midland Region), Somerton (Western Region) and Sandy (Eastern Region), British Railways, during June and July 1969, and on the General Safety of this form of Track'', Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London, 1970]</ref>\n\n=== Improper operation of control systems ===\n[[File:V90_entgleist.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[DB Class V 90|DB V90]] shunter derailed on a disused point]]\nIn the [[Connington South rail crash]] on 5 March 1967 in England, a signaller moved the points immediately in front of an approaching train.

The collapse of the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Communist system]] and the establishment of political pluralism post-1991 brought important changes to the structure of the Albanian Police. The Ministry of Public Order and the General Directorate of Police were established in April 1991, and the new law of July 1991 established the Public Order Police. Nearly 80% of police manpower, i.e. personnel who had served under the previous system, were replaced by new recruits. On 4 November 1991, the Albanian Police was accepted as a member of [[Interpol]]. The emergency number is 129.\n\n==History==\nThe original '''Albanian Police''' was founded on 13 January 1913 by the government of [[Ismail Qemali]], Albania's first [[prime minister]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/news/balkans/ata/1998/98-01-11.ata.html#06|title=Albanian Telegraphic Agency (ATA), 98-01-11|website=www.hri.org}}</ref>\n[[File:Albanian State Police HQ in Tiran\u00eb.jpg|thumb|Building of the Albanian State Police Headquarters in Tiran\u00eb]]\n===The crisis of 1997===\n{{Main|Albanian Rebellion of 1997}}\nFollowing the collapse of the Albanian economy in January\u2013February 1997 in the wake of the implosion of [[Pyramid schemes in Albania|the Ponzi pyramid banking schemes]] promoted by the government,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2000/03/jarvis.htm|title=Collapse of the Ponzi schemes 1997|publisher=International Monetary Fund|accessdate=2015-03-09}}</ref> increasing insurgency in early March led to the Police and Republican Guard deserting en masse because it became clear they were unlikely to be paid, leaving their armouries unlocked,<ref>[[Albanian Rebellion of 1997#Opening of the depots]]</ref> which were promptly looted by parties unknown, believed to mostly have been the local crime bodies and self-appointed militias: many of the weapons eventually surfaced in the ethnic fighting in Kosovo. \n[[File:97-9.jpg|thumb|left|Riot police in 1997 in Albania]]\nThe resulting anarchy led a number of nations to use military forces to evacuate citizens,<ref>[[Operation Silver Wake]]</ref><ref>[[Operation Libelle]]</ref> culminating in the UN authorising [[Operation Alba]] (\"Daybreak\"), a short-term military stabilisation force led by the Italian Army, tasked with facilitating the repatriation of foreigners and laying the foundations for another International Organisation to undertake the longer-term restabilisation. The political debate eventually settled in Europe within the body responsible for the defence diplomatic coordination of the Continent, the Council of the Western European Union. In a 2-hour meeting which convened at 1400 hrs on 2 May 1997,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defensie.nl/english/topics/historical-missions/contents/mission-overview/1997/multinational-advisory-police-element-mape-and-the-european-commission-police-assistance-in-albania-ecpa|title=NL MOD History of MAPE|publisher=Dutch Ministry of Defence|accessdate=2015-03-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309230257/https://www.defensie.nl/english/topics/historical-missions/contents/mission-overview/1997/multinational-advisory-police-element-mape-and-the-european-commission-police-assistance-in-albania-ecpa|archive-date=9 March 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> the WEU Council decided on the immediate establishment of the Multinational Advisory Police Element, sending a pathfinder officer, a Norwegian Police Colonel, the same evening.\nThe Italian force in Operation Alba predicated the Command structure of MAPE passing into the Italian Carabinieri, General Pietro Pistolese, previously commanding the Genoa region, bringing his team with him. Four phases followed, assessment, reconstruction, support of the Albanian Police control during the Kosovo Crisis, and finally build-down and handback in early 2001, which was somewhat accelerated ahead of the transfer of the WEU's operational responsibilities to the Council of the EU on 30 June 2001. The reconstruction principally involved the reconstruction of the Judicial system and the training of Police, but the Finance section also accommodated economic specialists acting as the principal feedback into the correction of the Judicial system. The Command Team later formed the core of the [[European Union Border Assistance Mission Rafah]] from 2005 onwards.\n\n===Public Perception===\nAccording to a survey produced in 2009 for the [[USAID|United States Agency for International Development]] Albanian's perception of the police was as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idra-al.org/cs2009/index2.php |title=Corruption in Albania 2009 - Summary of Findings |publisher=Institute for Development Research and Alternatives |accessdate=2010-09-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821172525/http://www.idra-al.org/cs2009/index2.php |archivedate=21 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\n*On a scale of 0\u2013100 with 0 being Very Honest and 100 being Very Corrupt, Policemen were given a score of 63.1 points\n*When asked to what extent the police help to fight corruption, 0 being Not at All and 100 being Helps a Lot, the Police were given a score of 45.5\n*When asked about trust in institutions, 0 being No Trust at All and 100 being Trust a Lot, the Police were given a score of 47.8\n*When asked if during the previous year they had been asked for a bribe 7.8% said Yes\n*\"When asked how they were treated by the police, the proportion of respondents that replied \"Poorly\" or \"Very poorly\" was 26.6%, a decrease of 10.9 percentage points from 37.5% in 2005\"\n\nGiven that this was within eight years of the departure of the MAPE rebuilding mission, great concern must be expressed about the capacity of the police force to maintain the legal norms required of an aspirant EU State.\n\n\n===Modernization===\n[[File:Flamuri i Policis\u00eb s\u00eb Shtetit.svg|180px|thumb|right|Police flag]]\nIn 2014, the Ministry of Internal Affairs started a modernization process of the Albanian police, to modernize its equipment and methods. The first step was the acquisition of new police vans and cruisers, the next one was the installment of body cameras on police officers to improve their service and to be analysed after an operation. Uniforms of the every uniformed department of the Albanian police were overhauled and the logo was also changed.{{fact|date=June 2019}}\n\nSeveral operations were held from the years 2014 to 2016, in various criminally active regions of Albania (i.e. [[Lazarat]]) to restore confidence and belief of the Albanian public to support the actions of police. Body cameras are becoming an integral part of the Albanian police, used on various drug busts and high-profile operations, released afterwards to the public.{{fact|date=June 2019}}\n\n==Ranks==\nIn 2015, the State Police underwent reorganizational reforms which were expected to continue for several years.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Republic of|first1=Albania|title=Modernizimi i Policis\u00eb s\u00eb Shtetit|url=http://www.punetebrendshme.gov.al/al/te-rejat/lajme/prezantohen-uniformat-e-reja-te-policise-se-shtetit&page=30|website=www.punetebrendshme.gov.al|publisher=Ministry of Internal Affairs}}</ref> It implemented a new hierarchical structure composed of nine hierarchic ranks.<ref name=\"Ranks of Albanian police\">{{cite book|last1=Law on State Police|first1=Albania|title=Ranks of Albanian police|date=2014|publisher=Ministry of Internal Affairs|location=Albania|page=22|url=https://mb.gov.al/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/LIGJI_I_POLICISE_SE_SHTETIT_-_2014.pdf}}</ref><ref name=\"Ranks insignia of the Albanian police officers\">{{cite book|last1=Albanian State Police insignia|first1=Albania|title=Ranks insignia of the Albanian police officers|date=2016|publisher=General Directorate of State Police|location=Albania|pages=5-14; 53|url=https://arkiva.asp.gov.al/images/pdf/Gradat_simbolet_uniformat_dhe_shenjat_e_Policise_se_Shtetit_1.pdf|accessdate=24 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n{| style=\"width:50%; border:1px solid #8888aa; background:#fff; padding:0; font-size:90%; margin:0 12px 12px 0; text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"background:#DCDCDC;\"\n!\n! colspan=\"9\" | Rank insignia of the Albanian State Police\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#efefef;\"\n| Service Uniform\n|[[File:Grada Drejtues Madhor (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|[[File:Grada Drejtues i Lart\u00eb (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|[[File:Grada Drejtues i Par\u00eb (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|[[File:Grada Drejtues (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|[[File:Grada Kryekomisar (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|[[File:Grada Komisar (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|[[File:Grada N\u00ebnkomisar (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|[[File:Grada Inspektor (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|[[File:Grada Kursant\u00eb (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|-  style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n| Ceremonial Uniform\n|[[File:Grad\u00eb ceremoniali, Drejtues Madhor (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|[[File:Grad\u00eb ceremoniali, Drejtues i Lart\u00eb (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|[[File:Grad\u00eb ceremoniali, Drejtues i Par\u00eb (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|[[File:Grad\u00eb ceremoniali, Drejtues (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|[[File:Grad\u00eb ceremoniali, Kryekomisar (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|[[File:Grad\u00eb ceremoniali, Komisar (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|[[File:Grad\u00eb ceremoniali, N\u00ebnkomisar (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|[[File:Grad\u00eb ceremoniali, Inspektor (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|[[File:Grad\u00eb ceremoniali, Kursant\u00eb (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|-\n| Rank:\n| Chief Director <br> ''Drejtues Madhor''\n| Senior Director <br> ''Drejtues i Lart\u00eb''\n| First Director <br> ''Drejtues i Par\u00eb''\n| Director <br> ''Drejtues''\n| Chief <br>  Commissioner <br> ''Kryekomisar''\n| [[Police commissioner|Commissioner]] <br> ''Komisar''\n| Sub-<br>commissioner <br> ''N\u00ebnkomisar''\n| [[Inspector]] <br> ''Inspektor''\n| [[Cadet]] <br> ''Kursant\u00eb''\n|}\n\n===Pre-2015 ranks===\n{| style=\"width:50%; border:1px solid #8888aa; background:#fff; padding:0; font-size:90%; margin:0 12px 12px 0; text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"background:#DCDCDC;\"\n!\n! colspan=\"13\" | Rank insignia of the Albanian State Police 1991-2014<ref name=\"Pre-2015\">{{cite web|title=Albanian Police|date=2013|publisher=Uniforminsignia.net|url=http://mobile.www.uniforminsignia.org/?option=com_insigniasearch&Itemid=53&result=1766|accessdate=26 February 2020}}</ref>\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#efefef;\"\n| Uniform\n|[[File:None.svg|35px]]\n|[[File:None.svg|35px]]\n|[[File:None.svg|35px]]\n|[[File:None.svg|35px]]\n|[[File:None.svg|35px]]\n|[[File:None.svg|35px]]\n|[[File:None.svg|35px]]\n|[[File:None.svg|35px]]\n|[[File:None.svg|35px]]\n|[[File:None.svg|35px]]\n|[[File:None.svg|35px]]\n|[[File:None.svg|35px]]\n|[[File:None.svg|35px]]\n|-\n| Rank:\n| First Director <br> ''Drejtues i Par\u00eb''\n| Director <br> ''Drejtues''\n| Chief Commissioner <br> ''Kryekomisar''\n| Commissioner <br> ''Komisar''\n| Lieutenant Commissioner<br> ''Komisar toger''\n| Chief Inspector <br> ''Kryeinspektor''\n| Inspector <br> ''Inspektor''\n| Lieutenant Inspector <br> ''Inspektor toger''\n| Chief Assistant <br> ''Kryeasistent''\n| First Assistant <br> ''Asistent i par\u00eb''\n| Assistant <br> ''Asistent''\n| First Agent <br> ''Agjent i par\u00eb''\n| Agent <br> ''Agjent''\n|}\n\n==Branch units==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 50%;\"\n|-\n!

operates throughout the [[Albania|Republic of Albania]]. The collapse of the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Communist system]] and the establishment of political pluralism post-1991 brought important changes to the structure of the Albanian Police. The Ministry of Public Order and the General Directorate of Police were established in April 1991, and the new law of July 1991 established the Public Order Police. Nearly 80% of police manpower, i.e. personnel who had served under the previous system, were replaced by new recruits. On 4 November 1991, the Albanian Police was accepted as a member of [[Interpol]].

The political debate eventually settled in Europe within the body responsible for the defence diplomatic coordination of the Continent, the Council of the Western European Union. In a 2-hour meeting which convened at 1400 hrs on 2 May 1997,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defensie.nl/english/topics/historical-missions/contents/mission-overview/1997/multinational-advisory-police-element-mape-and-the-european-commission-police-assistance-in-albania-ecpa|title=NL MOD History of MAPE|publisher=Dutch Ministry of Defence|accessdate=2015-03-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309230257/https://www.defensie.nl/english/topics/historical-missions/contents/mission-overview/1997/multinational-advisory-police-element-mape-and-the-european-commission-police-assistance-in-albania-ecpa|archive-date=9 March 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> the WEU Council decided on the immediate establishment of the Multinational Advisory Police Element, sending a pathfinder officer, a Norwegian Police Colonel, the same evening.\nThe Italian force in Operation Alba predicated the Command structure of MAPE passing into the Italian Carabinieri, General Pietro Pistolese, previously commanding the Genoa region, bringing his team with him. Four phases followed, assessment, reconstruction, support of the Albanian Police control during the Kosovo Crisis, and finally build-down and handback in early 2001, which was somewhat accelerated ahead of the transfer of the WEU's operational responsibilities to the Council of the EU on 30 June 2001. The reconstruction principally involved the reconstruction of the Judicial system and the training of Police, but the Finance section also accommodated economic specialists acting as the principal feedback into the correction of the Judicial system. The Command Team later formed the core of the [[European Union Border Assistance Mission Rafah]] from 2005 onwards.\n\n===Public Perception===\nAccording to a survey produced in 2009 for the [[USAID|United States Agency for International Development]] Albanian's perception of the police was as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idra-al.org/cs2009/index2.php |title=Corruption in Albania 2009 - Summary of Findings |publisher=Institute for Development Research and Alternatives |accessdate=2010-09-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821172525/http://www.idra-al.org/cs2009/index2.php |archivedate=21 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\n*On a scale of 0-100 with 0 being Very Honest and 100 being Very Corrupt, Policemen were given a score of 63.1 points\n*When asked to what extent the police help to fight corruption, 0 being Not at All and 100 being Helps a Lot, the Police were given a score of 45.5\n*When asked about trust in institutions, 0 being No Trust at All and 100 being Trust a Lot, the Police were given a score of 47.8\n*When asked if during the previous year they had been asked for a bribe 7.8% said Yes\n*\"When asked how they were treated by the police, the proportion of respondents that replied \"Poorly\" or \"Very poorly\" was 26.6%, a decrease of 10.9 percentage points from 37.5% in 2005\"\n\nGiven that this was within eight years of the departure of the MAPE rebuilding mission, great concern must be expressed about the capacity of the police force to maintain the legal norms required of an aspirant EU State.\n\n\n===Modernization===\n[[File:Flamuri i Policis\u00eb s\u00eb Shtetit.svg|180px|thumb|right|Police flag]]\nIn 2014, the Ministry of Internal Affairs started a modernization process of the Albanian police, to modernize its equipment and methods. The first step was the acquisition of new police vans and cruisers, the next one was the installment of body cameras on police officers to improve their service and to be analysed after an operation. Uniforms of the every uniformed department of the Albanian police were overhauled and the logo was also changed.{{fact|date=June 2019}}\n\nSeveral operations were held from the years 2014 to 2016, in various criminally active regions of Albania (i.e. [[Lazarat]]) to restore confidence and belief of the Albanian public to support the actions of police. Body cameras are becoming an integral part of the Albanian police, used on various drug busts and high-profile operations, released afterwards to the public.{{fact|date=June 2019}}\n\n==Ranks==\nIn 2015, the State Police underwent reorganizational reforms which were expected to continue for several years.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Republic of|first1=Albania|title=Modernizimi i Policis\u00eb s\u00eb Shtetit|url=http://www.punetebrendshme.gov.al/al/te-rejat/lajme/prezantohen-uniformat-e-reja-te-policise-se-shtetit&page=30|website=www.punetebrendshme.gov.al|publisher=Ministry of Internal Affairs}}</ref> It implemented a new hierarchical structure composed of nine hierarchic ranks.<ref name=\"Ranks of Albanian police\">{{cite book|last1=Law on State Police|first1=Albania|title=Ranks of Albanian police|date=2014|publisher=Ministry of Internal Affairs|location=Albania|page=22|url=https://mb.gov.al/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/LIGJI_I_POLICISE_SE_SHTETIT_-_2014.pdf}}</ref><ref name=\"Ranks insignia of the Albanian police officers\">{{cite book|last1=Albanian State Police insignia|first1=Albania|title=Ranks insignia of the Albanian police officers|date=2016|publisher=General Directorate of State Police|location=Albania|pages=5-14; 53|url=https://arkiva.asp.gov.al/images/pdf/Gradat_simbolet_uniformat_dhe_shenjat_e_Policise_se_Shtetit_1.pdf|accessdate=24 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n{| style=\"width:50%; border:1px solid #8888aa; background:#fff; padding:0; font-size:90%; margin:0 12px 12px 0; text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"background:#DCDCDC;\"\n!\n! colspan=\"9\" | Rank insignia of the Albanian State Police\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#efefef;\"\n| Service Uniform\n|[[File:Grada Drejtues Madhor (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|[[File:Grada Drejtues i Lart\u00eb (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|[[File:Grada Drejtues i Par\u00eb (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|[[File:Grada Drejtues (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|[[File:Grada Kryekomisar (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|[[File:Grada Komisar (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|[[File:Grada N\u00ebnkomisar (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|[[File:Grada Inspektor (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|[[File:Grada Kursant\u00eb (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|-  style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n| Ceremonial Uniform\n|[[File:Grad\u00eb ceremoniali, Drejtues Madhor (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|[[File:Grad\u00eb ceremoniali, Drejtues i Lart\u00eb (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|[[File:Grad\u00eb ceremoniali, Drejtues i Par\u00eb (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|[[File:Grad\u00eb ceremoniali, Drejtues (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|[[File:Grad\u00eb ceremoniali, Kryekomisar (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|[[File:Grad\u00eb ceremoniali, Komisar (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|[[File:Grad\u00eb ceremoniali, N\u00ebnkomisar (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|[[File:Grad\u00eb ceremoniali, Inspektor (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|[[File:Grad\u00eb ceremoniali, Kursant\u00eb (Policia e Shtetit).svg|35px]]\n|-\n| Rank:\n| Chief Director <br> ''Drejtues Madhor''\n| Senior Director <br> ''Drejtues i Lart\u00eb''\n| First Director <br> ''Drejtues i Par\u00eb''\n| Director <br> ''Drejtues''\n| Chief <br>  Commissioner <br> ''Kryekomisar''\n| [[Police commissioner|Commissioner]] <br> ''Komisar''\n| Sub-<br>commissioner <br> ''N\u00ebnkomisar''\n| [[Inspector]] <br> ''Inspektor''\n| [[Cadet]] <br> ''Kursant\u00eb''\n|}\n\n===Pre-2015 ranks===\n{| style=\"width:50%; border:1px solid #8888aa; background:#fff; padding:0; font-size:90%; margin:0 12px 12px 0; text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"background:#DCDCDC;\"\n!\n! colspan=\"13\" | Rank insignia of the Albanian State Police 1991-2014<ref name=\"Pre-2015\">{{cite web|title=Albanian Police|date=2013|publisher=Uniforminsignia.net|url=http://mobile.www.uniforminsignia.org/?option=com_insigniasearch&Itemid=53&result=1766|accessdate=26 February 2020}}</ref>\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#efefef;\"\n| Uniform\n|[[File:None.svg|35px]]\n|[[File:None.svg|35px]]\n|[[File:None.svg|35px]]\n|[[File:None.svg|35px]]\n|[[File:None.svg|35px]]\n|[[File:None.svg|35px]]\n|[[File:None.svg|35px]]\n|[[File:None.svg|35px]]\n|[[File:None.svg|35px]]\n|[[File:None.svg|35px]]\n|[[File:None.svg|35px]]\n|[[File:None.svg|35px]]\n|[[File:None.svg|35px]]\n|-\n| Rank:\n| First Director <br> ''Drejtues i Par\u00eb''\n| Director <br> ''Drejtues''\n| Chief Commissioner <br> ''Kryekomisar''\n| Commissioner <br> ''Komisar''\n| Lieutenant Commissioner<br> ''Komisar toger''\n| Chief Inspector <br> ''Kryeinspektor''\n| Inspector <br> ''Inspektor''\n| Lieutenant Inspector <br> ''Inspektor toger''\n| Chief Assistant <br> ''Kryeasistent''\n| First Assistant <br> ''Asistent i par\u00eb''\n| Assistant <br> ''Asistent''\n| First Agent <br> ''Agjent i par\u00eb''\n| Agent <br> ''Agjent''\n|}\n\n==Branch units==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 50%;\"\n|-\n!

During the war, the CIA recruited the [[Hmong people|Hmong]] who lived in Laos and they assisted the CIA by disrupting supply routes which stretched from [[Laos]] to [[Vietnam]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. [[Vang Pao|General Vang Pao]] was the leader of this army and as a result, he was regarded as a father figure by the Hmong. After the United States made the decision to withdraw troops from Laos in 1972, Vang and his family escaped the Hmong genocide that was ordered by the [[Pathet Lao]] in order to \"exterminate the Hmong down to the last root\" in retaliation for their assistance to the United States. Many Hmong were able to relocate to the U.S., however, thousands of them were left behind and killed. Vang and his siblings relocated to the United States in 1980 and settled in [[California]]. Vang lived in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and eventually enlisted in the [[California National Guard]].\n\nSometime around 2000, Vang and his family moved to the Twin Cities Capital City of [[St. Paul]], neighboring Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nVang is the father of seven children. He is also a family [[shaman]]<ref>\n{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/01/us/hmong-hunter-charged-with-6-murders-is-said-to-be-a-shaman.html|title= Hmong Hunter Charged With 6 Murders Is Said to Be a Shaman|last1= Kinzer|first1= Stephen|date= 1 December 2004|newspaper= [[The New York Times]]|access-date= 17 December 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160504124052/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/01/us/hmong-hunter-charged-with-6-murders-is-said-to-be-a-shaman.html|archive-date= 2016-05-04|url-status= live}}\n</ref> and was a hunting enthusiast.\n\n== Shootings ==\nOn the weekend of the shootings, Vang went out deer hunting with two friends and their two sons in northwest [[Wisconsin]], a region where deer hunting is particularly popular, east of [[Birchwood, Wisconsin]] around the town of [[Meteor, Wisconsin|Meteor]]. Meteor extends over a large sparsely populated area.  The land in the area is a mix of public and private.  It is believed that Vang and his friends began their day on public land, but he later went onto a private 400 [[acre]] (1.6&nbsp;km\u00b2) tract of land.\n\nOn Sunday, November 21, a hunting party of about 15 people were in a [[hunting cabin|cabin]] on this private land.  Terry Willers, one of the two co-owners of the land, left the cabin and saw Vang sitting in a deer stand. Willers used a handheld [[radio]] to ask the people still in the cabin whether or not anyone should be in the stand.

A violent altercation broke out and four of the eight victims were shot in the back, and three of these four were hit by multiple rounds. Vang is believed to have fired about 20 rounds from a Saiga rifle chambered in [[7.62\u00d739mm]], which was recovered by police.  One of the wounded hunters died the next day, bringing the toll to six dead and two wounded.\n\nVang fled the scene on foot and discarded his remaining ammunition, later stating that he did not want to shoot anyone else.  Vang eventually came across another hunter riding an ATV (who had no affiliation with the victims), and this hunter offered to give Vang a ride, eventually taking him to Vang's cabin.  Vang was arrested when he returned to his cabin five hours after the shooting.  An officer waiting for Vang placed him into custody and transported him to the Sawyer County Jail.  His bail was set at $2.5 million.\n\n=== Victims ===\nThe victims were part of a group of about 15 people who made an annual opening-weekend trip to the Crotteau-Willers property.  Among those killed were father and son Robert and Joey Crotteau and Willers' daughter Jessica Willers.\n\nThose who were killed:\n\n* Robert Crotteau, 42\n* Joey Crotteau, 20\n* Alan Laski, 43\n* Mark Roidt, 28\n* Jessica Willers, 27\n* Denny Drew, 55\n\nThose who were wounded:\n* Lauren Hesebeck, 48\n* Terry Willers, 47\n\n== Investigation ==\nThere were conflicting reports about what may have led to the shootings. According to subsequent oral statements by Vang, one of the local hunters, Terry Willers, took the first shots at him from about 100 feet (30 m) away, and therefore the shootings in retaliation were in self-defense. No shell casing was ever recovered from Willers' gun as it was not analysed even though during the trial Hesebeck had admitted to firing a single shot later during the incident when Vang, noticing that Hesebeck was still alive, fired at him again. Hesebeck testified that no shot was fired before Vang started shooting. Additional forensic analysis of Willers' gun was not performed by the local law enforcement. The statements of both Vang and Hesebeck state that Vang removed the scope from his rifle before firing his first shot. \n\n===Racial motivation===\n\nVang stated that [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] resentment was a factor, alleging that during the verbal dispute, some of the local hunters yelled out racial slurs at him such as \"[[chink]]\" and \"[[gook]].\" On the stand, Hesebeck admitted that Robert Crotteau had called Vang a \"Hmong a--hole\" and \"chink\". Hesebeck also claimed that he told law enforcement that Robert Crotteau had problems with trespassers in the past, specifically citing Hmong hunters, who often travel to Wisconsin from Minnesota to hunt. He also claimed that the term \"Mud Duck\" is often used in Western Wisconsin to refer to Minnesota residents and in turn the term \"Cheesehead\" being used to describe Wisconsin residents. Willers used this term to describe Chai Vang when he radioed back to the cabin. Though the term does not necessarily have a racial connotation, the defense argued that it did, due to the fact that Willers and the others did not know at the time that Vang was from Minnesota.\n\nThe criminal complaint states that Vang shot four of the victims in the back, and Vang himself admits he shot one victim in the back. The all-white prosecution made use of these facts in arguing against the claim of self-defense.\n\n== Trial ==\nThe trial of Chai Soua Vang began Saturday, September 10, 2005 in Sawyer County Courthouse.  All fourteen jurors were selected from [[Dane County, Wisconsin]], and bused about {{convert|280|mi|km}} northwest to Sawyer County, where they were sequestered.\n\nVang told the jury he feared for his life and began firing only after another hunter's shot nearly hit him. He detailed for the jurors how the other hunters approached him, and how he responded by shooting at each one.  He says he shot two of the victims in the back because they were \"disrespectful.\" He recounted with clarity how he killed each victim. While saying on the stand, \"(he wished) it wasn't happening,\" Vang contended that three of the hunters deserved to die:\n\n\"Did Mr. Crotteau deserve to die?\" Wisconsin Attorney General Peg Lautenschlager asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Chai Soua Vang replied.\n\nVang further testified that Joseph Crotteau deserved to die \"because he accused me of giving him the finger and tried to cut in front of me to stop me from leaving.\" And Laski deserved to die because he had a gun, he said.<ref>{{cite news |title= Vang tells his story to Jury |newspaper = [[St. Paul Pioneer Press]] |date= 16 September 2005}}</ref> Vang re-enacted his deeds while on the stand, using his hands and arms to imitate the motions of firing a rifle. Vang's lawyers commented that some of his abnormal remarks were due to the [[language barrier]]. Therefore, when Vang responded affirmatively to the question that Mr. Crotteau and Mr. Laski \"deserved to die,\" his meaning implied that the men contributed to the circumstances that led to their deaths.\n \n=== Conviction ===\nOn September 16, 2005, Chai Soua Vang was found guilty of all six charges of first-degree intentional homicide and three charges of attempted homicide by a jury of eight women and four men, all white. On November 8, 2005, he was sentenced to six consecutive life terms plus seventy years (forty for two counts of attempted homicide plus five additional years for each count of homicide in the first degree); a sentence of [[life without parole]]. At the time, [[Wisconsin]] was one of 12 states in the United States that did not have the [[death penalty]].<ref>\n{{cite web| url= http://www.nbcnews.com/id/9972929/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/hunter-receives-life-prison-killing-six-men/#.VnJhgRV96VM| title= Hunter receives life in prison for killing six men| author= <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->| publisher= NBC News| agency= Associated Press| date= 11 August 2005| accessdate= 17 December 2015| quote= Judge Norman Yackel ordered Chai Soua Vang, 37, to serve six life prison terms, one after the other, guaranteeing he would never be freed from prison.

During the war, the CIA recruited the [[Hmong people|Hmong]] who lived in Laos and they assisted the CIA by disrupting supply routes which stretched from [[Laos]] to [[Vietnam]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. [[Vang Pao|General Vang Pao]] was the leader of this army and as a result, he was regarded as a father figure by the Hmong. After the United States made the decision to withdraw troops from Laos in 1972, Vang and his family escaped the Hmong genocide that was ordered by the [[Pathet Lao]] in order to \"exterminate the Hmong down to the last root\" in retaliation for their assistance to the United States. Many Hmong were able to relocate to the U.S., however, thousands of them were left behind and killed. Vang and his siblings relocated to the United States in 1980 and settled in [[California]]. Vang lived in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and eventually enlisted in the [[California National Guard]].\n\nSometime around 2000, Vang and his family moved to the Twin Cities Capital City of [[St. Paul]], neighboring Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nVang is the father of seven children. He is also a family [[shaman]]<ref>\n{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/01/us/hmong-hunter-charged-with-6-murders-is-said-to-be-a-shaman.html|title= Hmong Hunter Charged With 6 Murders Is Said to Be a Shaman|last1= Kinzer|first1= Stephen|date= 1 December 2004|newspaper= [[The New York Times]]|access-date= 17 December 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160504124052/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/01/us/hmong-hunter-charged-with-6-murders-is-said-to-be-a-shaman.html|archive-date= 2016-05-04|url-status= live}}\n</ref> and was a hunting enthusiast.\n\n== Shootings ==\nOn the weekend of the shootings, Vang went out deer hunting with two friends and their two sons in northwest [[Wisconsin]], a region where deer hunting is particularly popular, east of [[Birchwood, Wisconsin]] around the town of [[Meteor, Wisconsin|Meteor]]. Meteor extends over a large sparsely populated area.  The land in the area is a mix of public and private.  It is believed that Vang and his friends began their day on public land, but he later went onto a private 400 [[acre]] (1.6&nbsp;km\u00b2) tract of land.\n\nOn Sunday, November 21, a hunting party of about 15 people were in a [[hunting cabin|cabin]] on this private land.  Terry Willers, one of the two co-owners of the land, left the cabin and saw Vang sitting in a deer stand. Willers used a handheld [[radio]] to ask the people still in the cabin whether or not anyone should be in the stand. Upon receiving a response in the negative, he approached Vang and told him to leave the property. Vang then apologized and started moving south towards a trail through a forested area of the property.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://madison.com/news/the-vang-trial-witness-landowner-swore-at-vang/article_a976cb77-d669-5ca9-b451-6df3fb95eb41.html|title=THE VANG TRIAL WITNESS: LANDOWNER SWORE AT VANG|first=ROBERT IMRIE Associated|last=Press|website=madison.com}}</ref> According to Terry Willers' testimony, \"As Bob got back on the radio and asked me where he was at and I said, uh, he's heading south down on the food plot right now.

His employer testified that two months before the killing, Nichols mentioned that he would have killed a Hmong hunter that he had seen in the woods if he had been carrying a shotgun.<ref>https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1400868/cha_vang_murder/</ref><ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20071011005001/http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/10/06/hunter.homicide.ap/index.html</ref> On October 6, 2007, an all-white jury found Nichols guilty of a lesser charge of second-degree intentional homicide and sentenced him to 60 years in prison. \"The message sent to the Hmong community is that someone can shoot a Hmong hunter and not get the maximum sentence,\" said Tou Ger Xiong, spokesman for the Coalition for Community Relations in St. Paul, Minnesota.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20071011005001/http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/10/06/hunter.homicide.ap/index.html</ref>\n\n== Military experience ==\n* Six years in the California National Guard, 1989\u20131995\n* Sharpshooter qualification badge (mid-level, above \"[[Marksman]]\")\n* Good Conduct medal\n\n==See also==\n*[[Racial discrimination in jury selection]]\n*[[Murder of Vincent Chin]]\n\n==Sources==\n* Ashley H.
