The following year the Liberal Party reunited but Morris ran as an Independent Liberal against Evans. In one of the most surprising results of the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 general election]] Morris was elected. In [[1924 United Kingdom general election|the follow year's general election]] he was returned unopposed as an official Liberal candidate.\n\nHis opposition to both Lloyd George and the introduction of tariffs resulted in his remaining with the official (\"[[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Samuelite]]\") Liberals when the party split three ways in advance of the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]]. The following year Morris was appointed as a [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|Metropolitan Police magistrate]], a salaried post which vacated his seat because the post was an 'office of profit under the Crown' and incompatible with membership of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].

Babington stated that he had always been on friendly terms with the Roman Catholic parish priest and his Roman Catholic parishioners and had no intention of offending them but was in fact pushed to publish it by local magistrates.

He stood staring at the gentleman for several seconds before uttering \"Practice once in a fuckin' while\" while walking away. Teller spoke at length during an interview on the ''[[Charlie Rose (TV series)|Charlie Rose]]'' television program on January 27, 2014. During their performance in the series premiere of ''[[Penn & Teller: Fool Us]]'', Penn is rambling on and Teller yells out his name, Teller can then be heard telling Penn to \"shut up\".

The book features his father's paintings and 100 unpublished cartoons which were strongly influenced by [[George Lichty]]'s ''[[Grin and Bear It]]''. The book was favorably reviewed by ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''. Teller's father's \"wryly observed scenes of Philadelphia street life\" were created in 1939. Teller and his father's \"memories began to pump and the stories flowed\" after they opened boxes of old letters that Teller read out loud (learning for the first time about a period in his parents' lives that he knew nothing about, such as the fact that his father's name is really Israel Max Teller). Joe's Depression-era hobo adventures led to travels throughout the U.S., Canada and Alaska, and by 1933, he returned to Philadelphia for art study. After Joe and Irene met during evening art classes, they married, and Joe worked half-days as a ''Philadelphia Inquirer'' copy boy. When the ''Inquirer'' rejected his cartoons, he moved into advertising art just as World War II began. Employing excerpts from letters and postcards, Teller successfully re-creates the world of his parents in a relaxed writing style of light humor and easy (yet highly effective) transitions between the past and present.<ref name=pubweekly>\"Forecasts\", ''Publishers Weekly'', August 15, 2000.</ref>\n\nTeller is a co-author of the paper \"Attention and Awareness in Stage magic: Turning Tricks into Research\", published in ''Nature Reviews Neuroscience'' (November 2008).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Macknik, S.L. |title=Attention and Awareness in Stage Magic: Turning Tricks into Research |journal=Nat.

After Joe and Irene met during evening art classes, they married, and Joe worked half-days as a ''Philadelphia Inquirer'' copy boy. When the ''Inquirer'' rejected his cartoons, he moved into advertising art just as World War II began. Employing excerpts from letters and postcards, Teller successfully re-creates the world of his parents in a relaxed writing style of light humor and easy (yet highly effective) transitions between the past and present.<ref name=pubweekly>\"Forecasts\", ''Publishers Weekly'', August 15, 2000.</ref>\n\nTeller is a co-author of the paper \"Attention and Awareness in Stage magic: Turning Tricks into Research\", published in ''Nature Reviews Neuroscience'' (November 2008).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Macknik, S.L. |title=Attention and Awareness in Stage Magic: Turning Tricks into Research |journal=Nat.

The gel exudations through the concrete cracks have a characteristic yellow color and a high pH.]]\n\nTo attempt to simplify and to stylize a very complex set of various reactions, the whole ASR reaction, after its complete evolution (ageing process) in the presence of sufficient Ca<sup>2+</sup> cations available in solution, could be compared to the [[pozzolanic reaction]] which would be catalysed by the undesirable presence of excessive concentrations of alkali hydroxides (NaOH and KOH) in the concrete. It is a mineral acid-base reaction between [[NaOH]] or [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]], [[calcium hydroxide]], also known as [[portlandite]], or (Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>), and [[silicic acid]] (H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, or Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>). For simplifying, after a complete exchange of the alkali cations with the calcium ions released by portlandite, the alkali-silica reaction in its ultimate stage leading to [[calcium silicate hydrate]] (C-S-H) could be schematically represented as following:\n\n:Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> &rarr; Ca<sup>2+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; CaH<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}}\n\nHere, the silicic acid H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, or Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>, which is equivalent to SiO<sub>2</sub> \u00b7 2 H<sub>2</sub>O represents hydrous or amorphous silica for the sake of simplicity in aqueous chemistry. \n\nOne will also note that the NaOH and KOH species responsible for the silica dissolution do not explicitly appear in this simplified representation, because they are continuously regenerated from the cation exchange reaction with portlandite. \n\n===Silica dissolution mechanism===\n\nThe surface of solid silica in contact with water is covered by [[siloxane]] bonds (\u2261Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2261) and [[silanol]] groups (\u2261Si\u2013OH) sensitive to an alkaline attack by {{chem|OH|-}} ions. Siloxane bonds may undergo [[hydrolysis]] and [[condensation reaction|condensation]] reactions as schematically represented hereafter: \n\n[[File:SiloxaneFxnlGp.png|100px|right|Siloxane bond between two silicon atoms.]]\n\n: \u2261Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2261 + {{chem|H|2|O}} &nbsp; \u2194 &nbsp; \u2261Si\u2013OH + HO\u2013Si\u2261\n: =Si=O  + {{chem|H|2|O}} &nbsp; \u2194 &nbsp; ={{chem|Si|(\u2013OH|)|2}}\n\n[[File:Silanol group.png|120px|right|Chemical structure of a [[silanol]] group.]]\n\nOn the other hand, [[silanol]] groups can also undergo [[protonation]]/deprotonation: \n: \u2261Si\u2013OH &nbsp; \u2194 &nbsp; \u2261Si\u2013{{chem|O|\u2212}} + {{chem|H|+}}.\n\nThese equilibria can be shifted towards the right side of the reaction leading to silica dissolution by increasing the concentration of [[hydroxide]] [[anion]] (OH<sup>\u2013</sup>), i.e., by increasing the pH of the solution. \n\n[[Alkaline hydrolysis]] of siloxane bonds occurs by [[nucleophilic substitution]] of OH<sup>\u2013</sup> onto a silicon atom, while another <sup>\u2013</sup>O\u2013Si group is leaving to preserve the tetravalent character of Si atom:\n\n: \u2261Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2261 + {{chem|O|H|-}} &nbsp; \u2192 &nbsp; \u2261Si\u2013OH + <sup>\u2013</sup>O\u2013Si\u2261\n: =Si=O  + {{chem|O|H|-}} &nbsp; \u2192 &nbsp; ={{chem|SiO|(OH|)|-}}\n\n[[Protonation|Deprotonation]] of [[silanol]] groups: \n: \u2261Si\u2013OH + {{chem|O|H|-}} &nbsp; \u2192 &nbsp; \u2261Si\u2013{{chem|O|\u2212}} + {{chem|H|2|O}}.\n\nIn the pH range 0 \u2013 7, the solubility of silica is constant, but above pH 8, the hydrolysis of siloxane bonds and deprotonation of silanol groups exponentially increase with pH. This is why glass easily dissolves at high pH and does not withstand extremely basic NaOH/KOH solutions. Therefore, NaOH/KOH released during cement hydration attacks and dissolves the tridimensional network of silica present in the aggregates. Amorphous or poorly crystallized silica, as [[cryptocrystalline]] [[chalcedony]] or [[chert]] present in [[flint]]s (in [[chalk]]) or rolled river [[gravel]]s, is much more soluble and sensitive to alkaline attack by OH<sup>\u2013</sup> anions than well crystallized silica such as [[quartz]]. Strained (deformed) quartz or chert exposed to [[frost weathering|freeze-thaw]] cycles in Canada and [[Nordic countries]] are also more sensitive to alkaline (high pH) solutions. \n\nThe species responsible for silica dissolution is the [[hydroxide]] [[anion]] (OH<sup>\u2013</sup>). The high pH conditions are said to be [[Alkali#Alkali_salts|alkaline]] and one also speaks of the [[alkalinity]] of the basic solutions. For the sake of electroneutrality, (OH<sup>\u2013</sup>) anions need to be accompanied by positively charged cations, Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup> in [[sodium hydroxide|NaOH]] or [[potassium hydroxide|KOH]] solutions respectively. [[Sodium|Na]] and [[potassium|K]] both belong to the [[alkali metal]]s column in the [[Mendeleev table]]. When speaking of alkali's, one systematically refers to NaOH and KOH basic hydroxides, or their corresponding oxides Na<sub>2</sub>O and K<sub>2</sub>O in cement. Therefore, it is the hydroxide, or the oxide, component of the salt which is the only relevant chemical species for silica dissolution, not the alkali metal in itself. However, to determine the alkali equivalent content (Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>eq</sub>) in cement, because the need to maintain electroneutrality in solids or in solution, one directly measures the contents of cement in Na and K elements and one conservatively considers that their counter ions are the hydroxide ions. As Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> cations are hydrated species, they also contribute to retain water in alkali-silica reaction products.\n\n===Catalysis of ASR by dissolved NaOH or KOH===\n\nThe ASR reaction significantly differs from the pozzolanic reaction by the fact that it is catalysed by soluble [[alkali]] [[hydroxide]]s ([[NaOH]] / [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]]) at very high pH. It can be represented as follows using the classical geochemical notation for representing silica by the fully hydrated dissolved silica (Si(OH)<sub>4</sub> or [[silicic acid]]: H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>), but an older industrial notation also exists (H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>, hemihydrated silica (does not exist), by analogy with [[carbonic acid]]):  \n\n:2 Na(OH) + H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> &rarr; Na<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}}\n\n:the so-produced soluble alkali silicagel can then react with [[calcium hydroxide]] ([[portlandite]]) to precipitate insoluble [[calcium silicate hydrate]]s (C-S-H phases) and regenerate NaOH for continuing the initial silica dissolution reaction: \n\n:Na<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}} + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>   &rarr;  CaH<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}} + 2 NaOH\n\nThe sum, or the combination, of the two above mentioned reactions gives a general reaction resembling the pozzolanic reaction, but it is important to keep in mind that this reaction is catalysed by the undesirable presence in cement, or other concrete components, of soluble alkaline hydroxydes (NaOH / KOH) responsible for the dissolution of the silica (silicic acid) at high pH:\n\n:Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> &rarr; CaH<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}}\n\nWithout the presence of NaOH or KOH responsible for a high pH (~13.5), the amorphous silica would not be dissolved and the reaction would not evolve. Moreover, the soluble sodium or potassium silicate is very hygroscopic and swells when it absorbs water. When the sodium silicate gel forms and swells inside a porous siliceous aggregate, it first expands and occupies the free porosity. When this latter is completely filled, if the soluble but very viscous gel cannot be easily expelled from the silica network, the hydraulic pressure rises inside the attacked aggregate and leads to its fracture. It is the hydro-mechanical expansion of the damaged siliceous aggregate surrounded by calcium-rich hardened cement paste which is responsible for the development of a network of cracks in concrete. When the sodium silicate expelled from the aggregate encounters grains of portlandite present in the hardened cement paste, an exchange between sodium and calcium cations occurs and hydrated calcium silicate (C-S-H) precipitates with a concomitant release of NaOH. In its turn, the regenerated NaOH can react with the amorphous silica aggregate leading to an increased production of soluble sodium silicate. When a continuous rim of C-S-H completely envelops the external surface of the attacked siliceous aggregate, it behaves as a [[semi-permeable]] barrier and hinders the expulsion of the viscous sodium silicate while allowing the NaOH / KOH to diffuse from the hardened cement paste inside the aggregate. This selective barrier of C-S-H contributes to increase the hydraulic pressure inside the aggregate and aggravates the cracking process. It is the expansion of the aggregates which damages concrete in the alkali-silica reaction.\n\nPortlandite (Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>) represents the reserve of OH<sup>\u2013</sup> anions in the solid phase. As long as portlandite, or the siliceous aggregates, has not become completely exhausted, the ASR reaction will continue. The alkali hydroxides are continuously regenerated by the reaction of the sodium silicate with portlandite and thus represent the transmission belt of the ASR reaction driving it to completeness. It is thus impossible to interrupt the ASR reaction. The only way to avoid ASR in the presence of siliceous aggregates and water is to maintain the concentration of soluble alkali (NaOH and KOH) at the lowest possible level in concrete, so that the catalysis mechanism becomes negligible.\n\n===Analogy with the soda lime carbonation===\n\nThe alkali-silica reaction mechanism catalysed by a soluble [[strong base]] as NaOH or KOH in the presence of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> (alkalinity buffer present in the solid phase) can be compared with the [[carbonation]] process of [[soda lime]]. The [[silicic acid]] ([[silicic acid|H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>]] or [[SiO2|SiO<sub>2</sub>]]) is simply replaced in the reaction by the [[carbonic acid]] ([[H2CO3|H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>]] or [[CO2|CO<sub>2</sub>]]).   \n\n:{| border = 0\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | (1)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | CO<sub>2</sub> + 2 NaOH&nbsp;  || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; &nbsp; || Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O|| &nbsp; ||(CO<sub>2</sub> trapping by soluble NaOH)\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | (2)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; || CaCO<sub>3</sub> + 2 NaOH || &nbsp; &nbsp; ||(regeneration of NaOH)\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | sum (1+2)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | CO<sub>2</sub> + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; || CaCO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O || &nbsp; &nbsp; ||(global reaction)\n|}\n\nIn the presence of water or simply [[relative humidity|ambient moisture]], the strong bases, NaOH or KOH, readily [[solubility|dissolve]] in their [[mineral hydration|hydration water]] ([[hygroscopic]] substances, [[deliquescence]] phenomenon) and this greatly facilitates the [[catalysis]] process because the reaction in aqueous solution occurs much faster than in the dry solid phase. The moist NaOH impregnates the surface and the [[porosity]] of calcium hydroxide grains with a high specific surface area. Soda lime is commonly used in closed-circuit [[rebreather|diving rebreathers]] and in [[anesthesia]] systems.\n\n===Main sources of {{chem|OH|-}} in hardened cement paste===\n\nOne can distinguish several sources of hydroxide anions ({{chem|OH|-}}) in hardened cement paste (HCP) from the family of [[Portland cement]] (pure [[Portland cement|OPC]], with [[Ground granulated blast-furnace slag|BFS]], or with cementitious additions, [[Fly ash|FA]] or [[Silica fume|SF]]). \n\n====Direct sources====\n\n{{chem|OH|-}} anions can be directly present in the HCP pore water or be slowly released from the solid phase (main buffer, or solid stock) by the dissolution of {{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} (portlandite) when its solubility increases when high pH value starts to drop. Beside these two main sources, ions exchange reactions and precipitation of poorly soluble calcium salts can also contribute to release of {{chem|OH|-}} in solution. \n\nAlkali hydroxides, NaOH and KOH, arise from the direct dissolution of {{chem|Na|2|O}} and {{chem|K|2|O}} oxides produced by the pyrolysis of the raw materials at high temperature (1450&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the [[cement kiln]]. The presence of minerals with high Na and K contents in the raw materials can thus be problematic. The ancient wet manufacturing process of cement, consuming more energy (water evaporation) that the modern dry process, had the advantage to eliminate much of the soluble Na and K salts present in the raw material. \n\nAs previously described in the two sections dealing respectively with ASR catalysis by alkali hydroxides and soda lime carbonation, soluble NaOH and KOH are continuously regenerated and released into solution when the soluble alkali silicate reacts with {{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} to precipitate insoluble calcium silicate. Therefore, portlandite is the main buffer of {{chem|OH|-}} in the solid phase. As long as the stock of hydroxide in the solid phase is not exhausted, the alkali-silica reaction can continue to proceed until complete disparition of one of the reagents ({{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} or  {{chem|Si|O|2}}) involved in the [[pozzolanic reaction]].\n\n====Indirect sources====\n\nThere exist also other indirect sources of {{chem|OH|-}}, all related to the presence of soluble Na and K salts in the  pore water of hardened cement paste (HCP). \nThe first category contains soluble Na and K salts whose corresponding anions can precipitate an insoluble calcium salts, e.g., {{chem|Na|2|SO|4}}, {{chem|Na|3|PO|4}}, {{chem|NaB|(OH)|4}}, ... . \n\nHereafter, an example for [[calcium sulfate]] ([[gypsum]]) precipitation releasing [[sodium hydroxide]]: \n\n: {{chem|Na|2|SO|4}} + {{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} \u2192 {{chem|Ca|SO|4}} + 2 NaOH\n\nor, the reaction of sodium carbonate with portlandite, also important for the catalysis of the [[alkali\u2013carbonate reaction]] as observed by Fournier and B\u00e9rub\u00e9 (2000) and B\u00e9rub\u00e9 ''et al.''

So, does it exist another route to still produce hydroxide anions in the hardened cement paste (HCP)?\n\nBeside portlandite, other hydrated solid phases are present in HCP. The main phases are the [[calcium silicate hydrate]]s (C-S-H) (the \"''glue''\" in cement paste) and calcium sulfo-aluminate (AFm and AFt, [[ettringite]]). Calcium-rich C-S-H phases are less soluble (~&nbsp;10<sup>-5</sup>&nbsp;M) than portlandite (CH) and are expected to play the same role for the calcium ions release. \n\nAn anion-exchange reaction between chloride ions and the hydroxide anions contained in the lattice of some calcium aluminate hydrates (C-A-H), or related phases (C-A-S-H, AFm, AFt), is suspected to also contribute to the release of hydroxide anions into solution. The principle mechanism is schematically illustrated hereafter for C-A-H phases: \n\n: {{chem|Cl|-}} + (C-A-H)\u2013OH \u2192 (C-A-H)\u2013Cl + {{chem|OH|-}}\n\nAs a simple, but robust, conclusion, the presence of soluble Na and K salts can also generate, by precipitation of poorly soluble calcium salt (with portlandite, CH) or anion exchange reactions (with phases related to C-A-H), the release of {{chem|OH|-}} anions into solution. Therefore, the presence of any salts of Na and K in cement pore water is undesirable and the measurements of Na and K elements is a good [[Proxy (statistics)|proxy]] ([[Indicator (statistics)|indicator]]) for the maximal concentration of {{chem|OH|-}} in pore solution. This is why the total alkali equivalent content ({{chem|Na|2|O|eq}}) of cement can simply rely on the measurements of [[sodium|Na]] and [[potassium|K]] (''e.g.'', by [[Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy|ICP-AES]], [[Atomic absorption spectroscopy|AAS]], [[X-ray fluorescence|XRF]] measurements techniques).\n\n===Alkali gel evolution and ageing===\n\nThe maturation process of the fluid alkali silicagel found in exudations into less soluble solid products found in gel pastes or in efflorescences is described hereafter. Four distinct steps are considered in this progressive transformation. \n\n1. {{chem|Si|O|2}} dissolution and {{chem|Na|2|Si|O|3}} formation (written here in ancient industrial silicate notation): \n\n:2 NaOH + {{chem|Si|O|2}} &rarr; {{chem|Na|2|Si|O|3}} \u00b7 {{chem|H|2|O}}\n:this reaction is accompanied by hydration and swelling of the alkali gel leading to the expansion of the affected agregates. The pH of the alkali gel is very high and it has often a characteristic amber color. The high pH of young alkali gel exudations often precludes the growth of mosses at the surface of concrete crack infilling.  \n\n2. Maturation of the alkali gel: polymerisation and gelation by the [[sol\u2013gel process]]. Condensation of silicate [[monomer]]s or [[oligomer]]s dispersed in a [[colloid|colloidal solution]] (sol) into a biphasic aqueous polymeric network of silicagel. {{chem|Ca|2+}} divalent cations released by [[calcium hydroxide]] ([[portlandite]]) when the pH starts to slightly drop may influence the gelation process. \n\n3. Cation exchange with calcium hydroxide (portlandite) and precipitation of amorphous [[calcium silicate hydrate]]s (C-S-H) accompanied by NaOH regeneration: \n:{{chem|Na|2|Si|O|3}} + {{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} &rarr; {{chem|Ca|Si|O|3}} + 2 NaOH\n\n:Amorphous C-S-H can recrystallize into [[Desert rose (crystal)|rosettes]] similar to these of [[gyrolite]]. \n\n4. Carbonation of the C-S-H leading to precipitation of calcium carbonate and amorphous SiO<sub>2</sub> stylized as follows: \n: {{chem|Ca|Si|O|3}} + {{chem|CO|2}} &rarr; {{chem|CaCO|3}} + {{chem|SiO|2}}\n\nAs long as the alkali gel ({{chem|Na|2|Si|O|3}}) has not yet reacted with {{chem|Ca|2+}} ions released from portlandite dissolution, it remains fluid and can easily exude from broken aggregates or through open cracks in the damage concrete structure. This can lead to visible yellow viscous liquid exudations (amber liquid droplets) at the surface of affected concrete. \n\nWhen pH slowly drops due to the progress of the silica dissolution reaction, solubility of calcium hydroxide increases and the alkali gel reacts with {{chem|Ca|2+}} ions. Its viscosity increases due to gelation process and its mobility (fluidity) strongly decreases when C-S-H phases start to precipitate after reaction with calcium hydroxide (portlandite). At this moment, the calcified gel becomes hard, hindering therefore the alkali gel transport in concrete. \n\nWhen the C-S-H gel is exposed to atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]], it undergoes a rapid carbonation and white/yellow [[efflorescence]]s appear at the surface of concrete. When the relatively fluid alkali gel continue to exude below the hardened superficial gel layer, it pushes the efflorescences out of the crack surface making them to appear in relief. Because the gel drying and carbonation reactions rates are faster than the gel exudation velocity (liquid gel expulsion rate through open cracks), in most of the cases, fresh liquid alkali exudates are not frequently encounterered at the surface of civil engineering concrete structures. Decompressed concrete cores can sometimes let observe fresh yellow liquid alkali exudations (viscous amber droplets) just after their drilling.\n\n==Mechanism of concrete deterioration==\nThe mechanism of ASR causing the deterioration of concrete can thus be described in four steps as follows:  \n# The very basic solution (NaOH / KOH) attacks the siliceous aggregates (silicic acid dissolution at high pH), converting the poorly crystallised or amorphous silica to a soluble but very viscous alkali silicate gel (N-S-H, K-S-H).\n# The consumption of NaOH / KOH by the dissolution reaction of amorphous silica decreases the pH of the pore water of the hardened cement paste. This allows the dissolution of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> (portandite) and increases the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions into the cement pore water. Calcium ions then react with the soluble sodium silicate gel to convert it into solid calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H). The C-S-H forms a continuous poorly permeable coating at the external surface of the aggregate.\n# The penetrated alkaline solution (NaOH / KOH) converts the remaining siliceous minerals into bulky soluble alkali silicate gel. The resulting expansive pressure increases in the core of the aggregate.\n# The accumulated pressure cracks the aggregate and the surrounding cement paste when the pressure exceeds the tolerance of the aggregate.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.cemconres.2007.06.008| last1 = Ichikawa| first1 = T.| last2 = Miura| first2 = M.| date = 2007| title = Modified model of alkali-silica reaction| journal = Cement and Concrete Research| volume = 37| issue = 9| pages = 1291\u20131297}}</ref>\n\n== Structural effects of ASR ==\nThe cracking caused by ASR can have several negative impacts on concrete, including:<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.fprimec.com/structural-effects-asr-concrete-structures|title=Structural Effects of ASR on Concrete Structures {{!}} FPrimeC Solutions|date=2016-10-28|newspaper=FPrimeC Solutions|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-11}}</ref>\n# Expansion: The swelling nature of ASR gel increases the chance of expansion in concrete elements.\n# [[Compressive strength]]: The effect of ASR on compressive strength can be minor for low expansion levels, to relatively higher degrees at larger expansion. (Swamy R.N. 1986) points out that the compressive strength is not very accurate parameter to study the severity of ASR; however, the test is done because of its simplicity.\n# [[Tensile strength]] / Flexural capacity: Researches show that ASR cracking can significantly reduce the tensile strength of concrete; therefore reducing the flexural capacity of beams. Some research on bridge structures indicate about 85% loss of capacity as a result of ASR.\n# [[Modulus of elasticity]]/UPV: The effect of ASR on elastic properties of concrete and [[Ultrasonic pulse velocity test|ultrasound pulse velocity]] (UPV) is very similar to tensile capacity. The modulus of elasticity is shown to be more sensitive to ASR than pulse velocity.\n# [[Fatigue (material)|Fatigue]]: ASR reduces the load [[bearing capacity]] and the fatigue life of concrete (Ahmed T. 2000).\n# [[Shear strength]]: ASR enhances the shear capacity of reinforced concrete with and without [[Shear wall|shear reinforcement]] (Ahmed T. 2000).\n\n==Mitigation==\nASR can be mitigated in new concrete by several complementary approaches:\n# ''Limit the alkali metal content of the cement''. Many standards impose limits on the \"Equivalent Na<sub>2</sub>O\" content of cement.\n# ''Limit the reactive silica content of the aggregate''. Certain volcanic rocks are particularly susceptible to ASR because they contain volcanic glass ([[obsidian]]) and should not be used as aggregate. The use of [[calcium carbonate]] aggregates is sometimes envisaged as an ultimate solution to avoid any problem. However, while it may be considered as a necessary condition, it is not a sufficient one. In principle, [[limestone]] (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) is not expected to contain a high level of silica, but it actually depends on its purity. Indeed, some siliceous limestones (a.o., ''[[Kieselkalk]]'' found in [[Switzerland]])<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Funk|first=Hanspeter|year=1975|title=The origin of authigenic quartz in the Helvetic Siliceous Limestone (Helvetischer Kieselkalk), Switzerland|journal=Sedimentology|volume=22|issue=2|pages=299\u2013306|bibcode=1975Sedim..22..299F|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3091.1975.tb00296.x}}<!--| accessdate = 2009-03-17\n--></ref> may be cemented by amorphous or poorly crystalline silica and can be very sensitive to the ASR reaction, as also observed with some Tournaisian siliceous limestones exploited in quarries in the area of [[Tournai]] in [[Belgium]].<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last = Monnin\n| first = Y.\n|author2=D\u00e9grugilliers P. |author3=Bulteel D. |author4=Garcia-Diaz E.\n | year = 2006\n| title = Petrography study of two siliceous limestones submitted to alkali-silica reaction\n| journal = Cement and Concrete Research\n| volume = 36\n| issue = 8\n| pages = 1460\u20131466\n| issn = 0008-8846\n| doi = 10.1016/j.cemconres.2006.03.025\n}}</ref> In Canada, the Spratt siliceous limestone is also particularly well known in studies dealing with ASR and is commonly used as the Canadian ASR reference aggregate.

A prompt reaction initiated at the early stage of concrete hardening on very fine silica particles will help to suppress a slow and delayed reaction with larger siliceous aggregates on the long term. Following the same principle, the fabrication of low-pH cement also implies the addition of finely divided pozzolanic materials rich in silicic acid to the concrete mix to decrease its alkalinity. Beside initially lowering the pH value of the concrete pore water, the main working mechanism of silica fume addition is to consume portlandite (the reservoir of hydroxyde (OH<sup>&ndash;</sup>) in the solid phase) and to decrease the porosity of the hardened cement paste by the formation of calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H). However, silica fume has to be very finely dispersed in the concrete mix, because agglomerated flakes of compacted silica fume can themselves also induce ASR if the dispersion process is insufficient. This can be the case in laboratory studies made on cement pastes alone in the absence of aggregates. However, most often, in large concrete batches, silica fume is sufficiently dispersed during mixing operations of fresh concrete by the presence of coarse and fine aggregates.  \n\nAs part of a study conducted by the [[Federal Highway Administration]], a variety of methods have been applied to field structures suffering from ASR-affected expansion and cracking. Some methods, such as the application of [[silane]]s, have shown significant promise, especially when applied to elements such as small columns and highway barriers, whereas other methods, such as the topical application of [[lithium]] compounds, have shown little or no promise in reducing ASR-induced expansion and cracking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/pavement/pub_details.cfm?id=894|title=Publication Details for Alkali-Aggregate Reactivity (AAR) Facts Book - Pavements - FHWA|work=dot.gov}}</ref>\n\n==Treatment==\nThere are no treatments in general in ASR affected structures. Repair in damaged sections is possible, but the reaction will continue. In some cases, when a sufficient drying of thin components (walls, slabs) of a structure is possible, and is followed by the installation of a [[Waterproofing|watertight]] [[Synthetic membrane|membrane]], the evolution of the reaction can be slow down, and sometimes stopped, because the lack of water to continue to fuel the reaction. Indeed, water plays a triple role in the alkali-silica reaction: solvent for the reaction taking place, transport medium for the dissolved species reacting, and finally also reagent consumed by the reaction itself. \n\nHowever, concrete at the center of thick concrete components or structures can never dry because water transport in saturated or unsaturated conditions is always limited by diffusion in the concrete pores (water present under the liquid form, or under the vapor state). The water diffusion time is thus proportional to the square of its transport distance. As a consequence, the water saturation degree inside thick concrete structures often remains higher than 80&nbsp;%, a level sufficient to provide enough water to the system and to maintain the alkali-silica reaction on going. \n\nMassive structures such as dams pose particular problems: they cannot be easily replaced, and the swelling can block [[spillway]] gates or [[turbine]] operations. Cutting slots across the structure can relieve some pressure, and help restore geometry and function.\n\n==Methods for testing potential alkali reactivity==\nThe American Society for Testing and Materials ([[ASTM International]]) has developed different standardized test methods for screening aggregates for their susceptibility to ASR:\n* ASTM C227: \u201cTest Method for Potential Alkali Reactivity of Cement-Aggregate Combinations (Mortar-Bar Method)\u201d\n* ASTM C289: \"Standard Test Method for Potential Alkali-Silica Reactivity of Aggregates (Chemical Method)\"\n* ASTM C295: \u201cGuide for Petrographic Examination of Aggregate for Concrete\u201d\n* ASTM C1260: \u201cTest Method for Potential Reactivity of Aggregates (Mortar-Bar-Test)\u201d. It is a rapid test of aggregates: immersion of mortar bars in NaOH 1 M at 80 \u00b0C for 14 days used to quickly identify highly reactive aggregates or quasi non-reactive aggregates. Beside an elevated temperature, the C1260 method also involves the use of a large quantity/inventory of NaOH in the solution in which the mortar bar is immersed. A large pool of OH<sup>\u2013</sup> anions is thus available to diffuse inside the mortar bar to dissolve silica present in aggregates. Consequently, this test is very severe and may exclude valuable aggregates. In case of non-decisive results, the long-term ASTM C1293 test method has to be used for a final screening. The main advantage of the ASTM C1260 test is that it allows to quickly identify extreme cases: very insensitive or very reactive aggregates. \n* ASTM C1293: \u201cTest Method for Concrete Aggregates by Determination of Length Change of Concrete Due to Alkali-Silica Reaction\u201d. It is a long-term confirmation test (1 or 2 years) at 38 \u00b0C in a water-saturated moist atmosphere (inside a thermostated oven) with concrete prisms containing the aggregates to be characterised mixed with a high-alkali cement specially selected to induce ASR. The concrete prisms are not directly immersed in an alkaline solution, but wrapped with moist tissues and tightly packed inside a water-tight plastic foils. \n* ASTM C1567: \"Standard Test Method for Determining the Potential Alkali-Silica Reactivity of Combinations of Cementitious Materials and Aggregate (Accelerated Mortar-Bar Method)\"\n\nOther concrete prism methods have also been internationally developed to detect potential alkali-reactivity of aggregates or sometimes hardened concrete cores, ''e.g.'':\n* The Oberholster method on which the ASTM C1260 test is based. \n* The Dungan method with superimposed additional thermal cycles. \n* The concrete microbar test was proposed by Grattan-Bellew ''et al.''

The gel exudations through the concrete cracks have a characteristic yellow color and a high pH.]]\n\nTo attempt to simplify and to stylize a very complex set of various reactions, the whole ASR reaction, after its complete evolution (ageing process) in the presence of sufficient Ca<sup>2+</sup> cations available in solution, could be compared to the [[pozzolanic reaction]] which would be catalysed by the undesirable presence of excessive concentrations of alkali hydroxides (NaOH and KOH) in the concrete. It is a mineral acid-base reaction between [[NaOH]] or [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]], [[calcium hydroxide]], also known as [[portlandite]], or (Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>), and [[silicic acid]] (H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, or Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>). For simplifying, after a complete exchange of the alkali cations with the calcium ions released by portlandite, the alkali-silica reaction in its ultimate stage leading to [[calcium silicate hydrate]] (C-S-H) could be schematically represented as following:\n\n:Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> &rarr; Ca<sup>2+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; CaH<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}}\n\nHere, the silicic acid H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, or Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>, which is equivalent to SiO<sub>2</sub> \u00b7 2 H<sub>2</sub>O represents hydrous or amorphous silica for the sake of simplicity in aqueous chemistry. \n\nOne will also note that the NaOH and KOH species responsible for the silica dissolution do not explicitly appear in this simplified representation, because they are continuously regenerated from the cation exchange reaction with portlandite. \n\n===Silica dissolution mechanism===\n\nThe surface of solid silica in contact with water is covered by [[siloxane]] bonds (\u2261Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2261) and [[silanol]] groups (\u2261Si\u2013OH) sensitive to an alkaline attack by {{chem|OH|-}} ions. Siloxane bonds may undergo [[hydrolysis]] and [[condensation reaction|condensation]] reactions as schematically represented hereafter: \n\n[[File:SiloxaneFxnlGp.png|100px|right|Siloxane bond between two silicon atoms.]]\n\n: \u2261Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2261 + {{chem|H|2|O}} &nbsp; \u2194 &nbsp; \u2261Si\u2013OH + HO\u2013Si\u2261\n: =Si=O  + {{chem|H|2|O}} &nbsp; \u2194 &nbsp; ={{chem|Si|(\u2013OH|)|2}}\n\n[[File:Silanol group.png|120px|right|Chemical structure of a [[silanol]] group.]]\n\nOn the other hand, [[silanol]] groups can also undergo [[protonation]]/deprotonation: \n: \u2261Si\u2013OH &nbsp; \u2194 &nbsp; \u2261Si\u2013{{chem|O|\u2212}} + {{chem|H|+}}.\n\nThese equilibria can be shifted towards the right side of the reaction leading to silica dissolution by increasing the concentration of [[hydroxide]] [[anion]] (OH<sup>\u2013</sup>), i.e., by increasing the pH of the solution. \n\n[[Alkaline hydrolysis]] of siloxane bonds occurs by [[nucleophilic substitution]] of OH<sup>\u2013</sup> onto a silicon atom, while another <sup>\u2013</sup>O\u2013Si group is leaving to preserve the tetravalent character of Si atom:\n\n: \u2261Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2261 + {{chem|O|H|-}} &nbsp; \u2192 &nbsp; \u2261Si\u2013OH + <sup>\u2013</sup>O\u2013Si\u2261\n: =Si=O  + {{chem|O|H|-}} &nbsp; \u2192 &nbsp; ={{chem|SiO|(OH|)|-}}\n\n[[Protonation|Deprotonation]] of [[silanol]] groups: \n: \u2261Si\u2013OH + {{chem|O|H|-}} &nbsp; \u2192 &nbsp; \u2261Si\u2013{{chem|O|\u2212}} + {{chem|H|2|O}}.\n\nIn the pH range 0 \u2013 7, the solubility of silica is constant, but above pH 8, the hydrolysis of siloxane bonds and deprotonation of silanol groups exponentially increase with pH. This is why glass easily dissolves at high pH and does not withstand extremely basic NaOH/KOH solutions. Therefore, NaOH/KOH released during cement hydration attacks and dissolves the tridimensional network of silica present in the aggregates. Amorphous or poorly crystallized silica, as [[cryptocrystalline]] [[chalcedony]] or [[chert]] present in [[flint]]s (in [[chalk]]) or rolled river [[gravel]]s, is much more soluble and sensitive to alkaline attack by OH<sup>\u2013</sup> anions than well crystallized silica such as [[quartz]]. Strained (deformed) quartz or chert exposed to [[frost weathering|freeze-thaw]] cycles in Canada and [[Nordic countries]] are also more sensitive to alkaline (high pH) solutions. \n\nThe species responsible for silica dissolution is the [[hydroxide]] [[anion]] (OH<sup>\u2013</sup>). The high pH conditions are said to be [[Alkali#Alkali_salts|alkaline]] and one also speaks of the [[alkalinity]] of the basic solutions. For the sake of electroneutrality, (OH<sup>\u2013</sup>) anions need to be accompanied by positively charged cations, Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup> in [[sodium hydroxide|NaOH]] or [[potassium hydroxide|KOH]] solutions respectively. [[Sodium|Na]] and [[potassium|K]] both belong to the [[alkali metal]]s column in the [[Mendeleev table]]. When speaking of alkali's, one systematically refers to NaOH and KOH basic hydroxides, or their corresponding oxides Na<sub>2</sub>O and K<sub>2</sub>O in cement. Therefore, it is the hydroxide, or the oxide, component of the salt which is the only relevant chemical species for silica dissolution, not the alkali metal in itself. However, to determine the alkali equivalent content (Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>eq</sub>) in cement, because the need to maintain electroneutrality in solids or in solution, one directly measures the contents of cement in Na and K elements and one conservatively considers that their counter ions are the hydroxide ions. As Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> cations are hydrated species, they also contribute to retain water in alkali-silica reaction products.\n\n===Catalysis of ASR by dissolved NaOH or KOH===\n\nThe ASR reaction significantly differs from the pozzolanic reaction by the fact that it is catalysed by soluble [[alkali]] [[hydroxide]]s ([[NaOH]] / [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]]) at very high pH. It can be represented as follows using the classical geochemical notation for representing silica by the fully hydrated dissolved silica (Si(OH)<sub>4</sub> or [[silicic acid]]: H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>), but an older industrial notation also exists (H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>, hemihydrated silica (does not exist), by analogy with [[carbonic acid]]):  \n\n:2 Na(OH) + H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> &rarr; Na<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}}\n\n:the so-produced soluble alkali silicagel can then react with [[calcium hydroxide]] ([[portlandite]]) to precipitate insoluble [[calcium silicate hydrate]]s (C-S-H phases) and regenerate NaOH for continuing the initial silica dissolution reaction: \n\n:Na<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}} + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>   &rarr;  CaH<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}} + 2 NaOH\n\nThe sum, or the combination, of the two above mentioned reactions gives a general reaction resembling the pozzolanic reaction, but it is important to keep in mind that this reaction is catalysed by the undesirable presence in cement, or other concrete components, of soluble alkaline hydroxydes (NaOH / KOH) responsible for the dissolution of the silica (silicic acid) at high pH:\n\n:Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> &rarr; CaH<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}}\n\nWithout the presence of NaOH or KOH responsible for a high pH (~13.5), the amorphous silica would not be dissolved and the reaction would not evolve. Moreover, the soluble sodium or potassium silicate is very hygroscopic and swells when it absorbs water. When the sodium silicate gel forms and swells inside a porous siliceous aggregate, it first expands and occupies the free porosity. When this latter is completely filled, if the soluble but very viscous gel cannot be easily expelled from the silica network, the hydraulic pressure rises inside the attacked aggregate and leads to its fracture. It is the hydro-mechanical expansion of the damaged siliceous aggregate surrounded by calcium-rich hardened cement paste which is responsible for the development of a network of cracks in concrete. When the sodium silicate expelled from the aggregate encounters grains of portlandite present in the hardened cement paste, an exchange between sodium and calcium cations occurs and hydrated calcium silicate (C-S-H) precipitates with a concomitant release of NaOH. In its turn, the regenerated NaOH can react with the amorphous silica aggregate leading to an increased production of soluble sodium silicate. When a continuous rim of C-S-H completely envelops the external surface of the attacked siliceous aggregate, it behaves as a [[semi-permeable]] barrier and hinders the expulsion of the viscous sodium silicate while allowing the NaOH / KOH to diffuse from the hardened cement paste inside the aggregate. This selective barrier of C-S-H contributes to increase the hydraulic pressure inside the aggregate and aggravates the cracking process. It is the expansion of the aggregates which damages concrete in the alkali-silica reaction.\n\nPortlandite (Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>) represents the reserve of OH<sup>\u2013</sup> anions in the solid phase. As long as portlandite, or the siliceous aggregates, has not become completely exhausted, the ASR reaction will continue. The alkali hydroxides are continuously regenerated by the reaction of the sodium silicate with portlandite and thus represent the transmission belt of the ASR reaction driving it to completeness. It is thus impossible to interrupt the ASR reaction. The only way to avoid ASR in the presence of siliceous aggregates and water is to maintain the concentration of soluble alkali (NaOH and KOH) at the lowest possible level in concrete, so that the catalysis mechanism becomes negligible.\n\n===Analogy with the soda lime carbonation===\n\nThe alkali-silica reaction mechanism catalysed by a soluble [[strong base]] as NaOH or KOH in the presence of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> (alkalinity buffer present in the solid phase) can be compared with the [[carbonation]] process of [[soda lime]]. The [[silicic acid]] ([[silicic acid|H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>]] or [[SiO2|SiO<sub>2</sub>]]) is simply replaced in the reaction by the [[carbonic acid]] ([[H2CO3|H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>]] or [[CO2|CO<sub>2</sub>]]).   \n\n:{| border = 0\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | (1)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | CO<sub>2</sub> + 2 NaOH&nbsp;  || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; &nbsp; || Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O|| &nbsp; ||(CO<sub>2</sub> trapping by soluble NaOH)\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | (2)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; || CaCO<sub>3</sub> + 2 NaOH || &nbsp; &nbsp; ||(regeneration of NaOH)\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | sum (1+2)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | CO<sub>2</sub> + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; || CaCO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O || &nbsp; &nbsp; ||(global reaction)\n|}\n\nIn the presence of water or simply [[relative humidity|ambient moisture]], the strong bases, NaOH or KOH, readily [[solubility|dissolve]] in their [[mineral hydration|hydration water]] ([[hygroscopic]] substances, [[deliquescence]] phenomenon) and this greatly facilitates the [[catalysis]] process because the reaction in aqueous solution occurs much faster than in the dry solid phase. The moist NaOH impregnates the surface and the [[porosity]] of calcium hydroxide grains with a high specific surface area. Soda lime is commonly used in closed-circuit [[rebreather|diving rebreathers]] and in [[anesthesia]] systems.\n\n===Main sources of {{chem|OH|-}} in hardened cement paste===\n\nOne can distinguish several sources of hydroxide anions ({{chem|OH|-}}) in hardened cement paste (HCP) from the family of [[Portland cement]] (pure [[Portland cement|OPC]], with [[Ground granulated blast-furnace slag|BFS]], or with cementitious additions, [[Fly ash|FA]] or [[Silica fume|SF]]). \n\n====Direct sources====\n\n{{chem|OH|-}} anions can be directly present in the HCP pore water or be slowly released from the solid phase (main buffer, or solid stock) by the dissolution of {{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} (portlandite) when its solubility increases when high pH value starts to drop. Beside these two main sources, ions exchange reactions and precipitation of poorly soluble calcium salts can also contribute to release of {{chem|OH|-}} in solution. \n\nAlkali hydroxides, NaOH and KOH, arise from the direct dissolution of {{chem|Na|2|O}} and {{chem|K|2|O}} oxides produced by the pyrolysis of the raw materials at high temperature (1450&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the [[cement kiln]]. The presence of minerals with high Na and K contents in the raw materials can thus be problematic. The ancient wet manufacturing process of cement, consuming more energy (water evaporation) that the modern dry process, had the advantage to eliminate much of the soluble Na and K salts present in the raw material. \n\nAs previously described in the two sections dealing respectively with ASR catalysis by alkali hydroxides and soda lime carbonation, soluble NaOH and KOH are continuously regenerated and released into solution when the soluble alkali silicate reacts with {{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} to precipitate insoluble calcium silicate. Therefore, portlandite is the main buffer of {{chem|OH|-}} in the solid phase. As long as the stock of hydroxide in the solid phase is not exhausted, the alkali-silica reaction can continue to proceed until complete disparition of one of the reagents ({{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} or  {{chem|Si|O|2}}) involved in the [[pozzolanic reaction]].\n\n====Indirect sources====\n\nThere exist also other indirect sources of {{chem|OH|-}}, all related to the presence of soluble Na and K salts in the  pore water of hardened cement paste (HCP). \nThe first category contains soluble Na and K salts whose corresponding anions can precipitate an insoluble calcium salts, e.g., {{chem|Na|2|SO|4}}, {{chem|Na|3|PO|4}}, {{chem|NaB|(OH)|4}}, ... . \n\nHereafter, an example for [[calcium sulfate]] ([[gypsum]]) precipitation releasing [[sodium hydroxide]]: \n\n: {{chem|Na|2|SO|4}} + {{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} \u2192 {{chem|Ca|SO|4}} + 2 NaOH\n\nor, the reaction of sodium carbonate with portlandite, also important for the catalysis of the [[alkali\u2013carbonate reaction]] as observed by Fournier and B\u00e9rub\u00e9 (2000) and B\u00e9rub\u00e9 ''et al.''

So, does it exist another route to still produce hydroxide anions in the hardened cement paste (HCP)?\n\nBeside portlandite, other hydrated solid phases are present in HCP. The main phases are the [[calcium silicate hydrate]]s (C-S-H) (the \"''glue''\" in cement paste) and calcium sulfo-aluminate (AFm and AFt, [[ettringite]]). Calcium-rich C-S-H phases are less soluble (~&nbsp;10<sup>-5</sup>&nbsp;M) than portlandite (CH) and are expected to play the same role for the calcium ions release. \n\nAn anion-exchange reaction between chloride ions and the hydroxide anions contained in the lattice of some calcium aluminate hydrates (C-A-H), or related phases (C-A-S-H, AFm, AFt), is suspected to also contribute to the release of hydroxide anions into solution. The principle mechanism is schematically illustrated hereafter for C-A-H phases: \n\n: {{chem|Cl|-}} + (C-A-H)\u2013OH \u2192 (C-A-H)\u2013Cl + {{chem|OH|-}}\n\nAs a simple, but robust, conclusion, the presence of soluble Na and K salts can also generate, by precipitation of poorly soluble calcium salt (with portlandite, CH) or anion exchange reactions (with phases related to C-A-H), the release of {{chem|OH|-}} anions into solution. Therefore, the presence of any salts of Na and K in cement pore water is undesirable and the measurements of Na and K elements is a good [[Proxy (statistics)|proxy]] ([[Indicator (statistics)|indicator]]) for the maximal concentration of {{chem|OH|-}} in pore solution. This is why the total alkali equivalent content ({{chem|Na|2|O|eq}}) of cement can simply rely on the measurements of [[sodium|Na]] and [[potassium|K]] (''e.g.'', by [[Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy|ICP-AES]], [[Atomic absorption spectroscopy|AAS]], [[X-ray fluorescence|XRF]] measurements techniques).\n\n===Alkali gel evolution and ageing===\n\nThe maturation process of the fluid alkali silicagel found in exudations into less soluble solid products found in gel pastes or in efflorescences is described hereafter. Four distinct steps are considered in this progressive transformation. \n\n1. {{chem|Si|O|2}} dissolution and {{chem|Na|2|Si|O|3}} formation (written here in ancient industrial silicate notation): \n\n:2 NaOH + {{chem|Si|O|2}} &rarr; {{chem|Na|2|Si|O|3}} \u00b7 {{chem|H|2|O}}\n:this reaction is accompanied by hydration and swelling of the alkali gel leading to the expansion of the affected agregates. The pH of the alkali gel is very high and it has often a characteristic amber color. The high pH of young alkali gel exudations often precludes the growth of mosses at the surface of concrete crack infilling.  \n\n2. Maturation of the alkali gel: polymerisation and gelation by the [[sol\u2013gel process]]. Condensation of silicate [[monomer]]s or [[oligomer]]s dispersed in a [[colloid|colloidal solution]] (sol) into a biphasic aqueous polymeric network of silicagel. {{chem|Ca|2+}} divalent cations released by [[calcium hydroxide]] ([[portlandite]]) when the pH starts to slightly drop may influence the gelation process. \n\n3. Cation exchange with calcium hydroxide (portlandite) and precipitation of amorphous [[calcium silicate hydrate]]s (C-S-H) accompanied by NaOH regeneration: \n:{{chem|Na|2|Si|O|3}} + {{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} &rarr; {{chem|Ca|Si|O|3}} + 2 NaOH\n\n:Amorphous C-S-H can recrystallize into [[Desert rose (crystal)|rosettes]] similar to these of [[gyrolite]]. \n\n4. Carbonation of the C-S-H leading to precipitation of calcium carbonate and amorphous SiO<sub>2</sub> stylized as follows: \n: {{chem|Ca|Si|O|3}} + {{chem|CO|2}} &rarr; {{chem|CaCO|3}} + {{chem|SiO|2}}\n\nAs long as the alkali gel ({{chem|Na|2|Si|O|3}}) has not yet reacted with {{chem|Ca|2+}} ions released from portlandite dissolution, it remains fluid and can easily exude from broken aggregates or through open cracks in the damage concrete structure. This can lead to visible yellow viscous liquid exudations (amber liquid droplets) at the surface of affected concrete. \n\nWhen pH slowly drops due to the progress of the silica dissolution reaction, solubility of calcium hydroxide increases and the alkali gel reacts with {{chem|Ca|2+}} ions. Its viscosity increases due to gelation process and its mobility (fluidity) strongly decreases when C-S-H phases start to precipitate after reaction with calcium hydroxide (portlandite). At this moment, the calcified gel becomes hard, hindering therefore the alkali gel transport in concrete. \n\nWhen the C-S-H gel is exposed to atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]], it undergoes a rapid carbonation and white/yellow [[efflorescence]]s appear at the surface of concrete. When the relatively fluid alkali gel continue to exude below the hardened superficial gel layer, it pushes the efflorescences out of the crack surface making them to appear in relief. Because the gel drying and carbonation reactions rates are faster than the gel exudation velocity (liquid gel expulsion rate through open cracks), in most of the cases, fresh liquid alkali exudates are not frequently encounterered at the surface of civil engineering concrete structures. Decompressed concrete cores can sometimes let observe fresh yellow liquid alkali exudations (viscous amber droplets) just after their drilling.\n\n==Mechanism of concrete deterioration==\nThe mechanism of ASR causing the deterioration of concrete can thus be described in four steps as follows:  \n# The very basic solution (NaOH / KOH) attacks the siliceous aggregates (silicic acid dissolution at high pH), converting the poorly crystallised or amorphous silica to a soluble but very viscous alkali silicate gel (N-S-H, K-S-H).\n# The consumption of NaOH / KOH by the dissolution reaction of amorphous silica decreases the pH of the pore water of the hardened cement paste. This allows the dissolution of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> (portandite) and increases the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions into the cement pore water. Calcium ions then react with the soluble sodium silicate gel to convert it into solid calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H). The C-S-H forms a continuous poorly permeable coating at the external surface of the aggregate.\n# The penetrated alkaline solution (NaOH / KOH) converts the remaining siliceous minerals into bulky soluble alkali silicate gel. The resulting expansive pressure increases in the core of the aggregate.\n# The accumulated pressure cracks the aggregate and the surrounding cement paste when the pressure exceeds the tolerance of the aggregate.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.cemconres.2007.06.008| last1 = Ichikawa| first1 = T.| last2 = Miura| first2 = M.| date = 2007| title = Modified model of alkali-silica reaction| journal = Cement and Concrete Research| volume = 37| issue = 9| pages = 1291\u20131297}}</ref>\n\n== Structural effects of ASR ==\nThe cracking caused by ASR can have several negative impacts on concrete, including:<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.fprimec.com/structural-effects-asr-concrete-structures|title=Structural Effects of ASR on Concrete Structures {{!}} FPrimeC Solutions|date=2016-10-28|newspaper=FPrimeC Solutions|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-11}}</ref>\n# Expansion: The swelling nature of ASR gel increases the chance of expansion in concrete elements.\n# [[Compressive strength]]: The effect of ASR on compressive strength can be minor for low expansion levels, to relatively higher degrees at larger expansion. (Swamy R.N. 1986) points out that the compressive strength is not very accurate parameter to study the severity of ASR; however, the test is done because of its simplicity.\n# [[Tensile strength]] / Flexural capacity: Researches show that ASR cracking can significantly reduce the tensile strength of concrete; therefore reducing the flexural capacity of beams. Some research on bridge structures indicate about 85% loss of capacity as a result of ASR.\n# [[Modulus of elasticity]]/UPV: The effect of ASR on elastic properties of concrete and [[Ultrasonic pulse velocity test|ultrasound pulse velocity]] (UPV) is very similar to tensile capacity. The modulus of elasticity is shown to be more sensitive to ASR than pulse velocity.\n# [[Fatigue (material)|Fatigue]]: ASR reduces the load [[bearing capacity]] and the fatigue life of concrete (Ahmed T. 2000).\n# [[Shear strength]]: ASR enhances the shear capacity of reinforced concrete with and without [[Shear wall|shear reinforcement]] (Ahmed T. 2000).\n\n==Mitigation==\nASR can be mitigated in new concrete by several complementary approaches:\n# ''Limit the alkali metal content of the cement''. Many standards impose limits on the \"Equivalent Na<sub>2</sub>O\" content of cement.\n# ''Limit the reactive silica content of the aggregate''. Certain volcanic rocks are particularly susceptible to ASR because they contain volcanic glass ([[obsidian]]) and should not be used as aggregate. The use of [[calcium carbonate]] aggregates is sometimes envisaged as an ultimate solution to avoid any problem. However, while it may be considered as a necessary condition, it is not a sufficient one. In principle, [[limestone]] (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) is not expected to contain a high level of silica, but it actually depends on its purity. Indeed, some siliceous limestones (a.o., ''[[Kieselkalk]]'' found in [[Switzerland]])<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Funk|first=Hanspeter|year=1975|title=The origin of authigenic quartz in the Helvetic Siliceous Limestone (Helvetischer Kieselkalk), Switzerland|journal=Sedimentology|volume=22|issue=2|pages=299\u2013306|bibcode=1975Sedim..22..299F|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3091.1975.tb00296.x}}<!--| accessdate = 2009-03-17\n--></ref> may be cemented by amorphous or poorly crystalline silica and can be very sensitive to the ASR reaction, as also observed with some Tournaisian siliceous limestones exploited in quarries in the area of [[Tournai]] in [[Belgium]].<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last = Monnin\n| first = Y.\n|author2=D\u00e9grugilliers P. |author3=Bulteel D. |author4=Garcia-Diaz E.\n | year = 2006\n| title = Petrography study of two siliceous limestones submitted to alkali-silica reaction\n| journal = Cement and Concrete Research\n| volume = 36\n| issue = 8\n| pages = 1460\u20131466\n| issn = 0008-8846\n| doi = 10.1016/j.cemconres.2006.03.025\n}}</ref> In Canada, the Spratt siliceous limestone is also particularly well known in studies dealing with ASR and is commonly used as the Canadian ASR reference aggregate.

A prompt reaction initiated at the early stage of concrete hardening on very fine silica particles will help to suppress a slow and delayed reaction with larger siliceous aggregates on the long term. Following the same principle, the fabrication of low-pH cement also implies the addition of finely divided pozzolanic materials rich in silicic acid to the concrete mix to decrease its alkalinity. Beside initially lowering the pH value of the concrete pore water, the main working mechanism of silica fume addition is to consume portlandite (the reservoir of hydroxyde (OH<sup>&ndash;</sup>) in the solid phase) and to decrease the porosity of the hardened cement paste by the formation of calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H). However, silica fume has to be very finely dispersed in the concrete mix, because agglomerated flakes of compacted silica fume can themselves also induce ASR if the dispersion process is insufficient. This can be the case in laboratory studies made on cement pastes alone in the absence of aggregates. However, most often, in large concrete batches, silica fume is sufficiently dispersed during mixing operations of fresh concrete by the presence of coarse and fine aggregates.  \n\nAs part of a study conducted by the [[Federal Highway Administration]], a variety of methods have been applied to field structures suffering from ASR-affected expansion and cracking. Some methods, such as the application of [[silane]]s, have shown significant promise, especially when applied to elements such as small columns and highway barriers, whereas other methods, such as the topical application of [[lithium]] compounds, have shown little or no promise in reducing ASR-induced expansion and cracking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/pavement/pub_details.cfm?id=894|title=Publication Details for Alkali-Aggregate Reactivity (AAR) Facts Book - Pavements - FHWA|work=dot.gov}}</ref>\n\n==Treatment==\nThere are no treatments in general in ASR affected structures. Repair in damaged sections is possible, but the reaction will continue. In some cases, when a sufficient drying of thin components (walls, slabs) of a structure is possible, and is followed by the installation of a [[Waterproofing|watertight]] [[Synthetic membrane|membrane]], the evolution of the reaction can be slow down, and sometimes stopped, because the lack of water to continue to fuel the reaction. Indeed, water plays a triple role in the alkali-silica reaction: solvent for the reaction taking place, transport medium for the dissolved species reacting, and finally also reagent consumed by the reaction itself. \n\nHowever, concrete at the center of thick concrete components or structures can never dry because water transport in saturated or unsaturated conditions is always limited by diffusion in the concrete pores (water present under the liquid form, or under the vapor state). The water diffusion time is thus proportional to the square of its transport distance. As a consequence, the water saturation degree inside thick concrete structures often remains higher than 80&nbsp;%, a level sufficient to provide enough water to the system and to maintain the alkali-silica reaction on going. \n\nMassive structures such as dams pose particular problems: they cannot be easily replaced, and the swelling can block [[spillway]] gates or [[turbine]] operations. Cutting slots across the structure can relieve some pressure, and help restore geometry and function.\n\n==Methods for testing potential alkali reactivity==\nThe American Society for Testing and Materials ([[ASTM International]]) has developed different standardized test methods for screening aggregates for their susceptibility to ASR:\n* ASTM C227: \u201cTest Method for Potential Alkali Reactivity of Cement-Aggregate Combinations (Mortar-Bar Method)\u201d\n* ASTM C289: \"Standard Test Method for Potential Alkali-Silica Reactivity of Aggregates (Chemical Method)\"\n* ASTM C295: \u201cGuide for Petrographic Examination of Aggregate for Concrete\u201d\n* ASTM C1260: \u201cTest Method for Potential Reactivity of Aggregates (Mortar-Bar-Test)\u201d. It is a rapid test of aggregates: immersion of mortar bars in NaOH 1 M at 80 \u00b0C for 14 days used to quickly identify highly reactive aggregates or quasi non-reactive aggregates. Beside an elevated temperature, the C1260 method also involves the use of a large quantity/inventory of NaOH in the solution in which the mortar bar is immersed. A large pool of OH<sup>\u2013</sup> anions is thus available to diffuse inside the mortar bar to dissolve silica present in aggregates. Consequently, this test is very severe and may exclude valuable aggregates. In case of non-decisive results, the long-term ASTM C1293 test method has to be used for a final screening. The main advantage of the ASTM C1260 test is that it allows to quickly identify extreme cases: very insensitive or very reactive aggregates. \n* ASTM C1293: \u201cTest Method for Concrete Aggregates by Determination of Length Change of Concrete Due to Alkali-Silica Reaction\u201d. It is a long-term confirmation test (1 or 2 years) at 38 \u00b0C in a water-saturated moist atmosphere (inside a thermostated oven) with concrete prisms containing the aggregates to be characterised mixed with a high-alkali cement specially selected to induce ASR. The concrete prisms are not directly immersed in an alkaline solution, but wrapped with moist tissues and tightly packed inside a water-tight plastic foils. \n* ASTM C1567: \"Standard Test Method for Determining the Potential Alkali-Silica Reactivity of Combinations of Cementitious Materials and Aggregate (Accelerated Mortar-Bar Method)\"\n\nOther concrete prism methods have also been internationally developed to detect potential alkali-reactivity of aggregates or sometimes hardened concrete cores, ''e.g.'':\n* The Oberholster method on which the ASTM C1260 test is based. \n* The Dungan method with superimposed additional thermal cycles. \n* The concrete microbar test was proposed by Grattan-Bellew ''et al.''

Trump was recorded bragging that a celebrity like himself \"can do anything\" to women, including \"just start kissing them{{nbsp}}... I don't even wait\" and \"grab 'em by the pussy\". Trump subsequently characterized those comments as \"locker room talk\" and denied actually behaving that way toward women, and he also apologized for the crude language. Many of his accusers stated that Trump's denials provoked them into going public with their allegations.\n\nAnother type of accusation was made, primarily after the audio recording surfaced, by several former [[Miss USA]] and [[Miss Teen USA]] contestants, who accused Trump of entering the dressing rooms of [[beauty pageant]] contestants. Trump, who owned the [[Miss Universe]] franchise, which includes both pageants, was accused of going into dressing rooms in 1997, 2000, 2001, and 2006, while contestants were in various stages of undress. During a 2005 interview on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', Trump said he could \"get away with things like that\".\n\nSexual misconduct allegations have been made against Trump by at least 22 women. Trump has denied the allegations, saying he has been the victim of [[media bias]], [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracies]], and a political [[smear campaign]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bump|first1=Philip|title=Trump blames a media conspiracy for women opposing him.

Jean Carroll (1995 or 1996)===\n{{update section|date=February 2020}}\nIn late June 2019, [[E. Jean Carroll]], writer, former Miss [[Indiana University]] and former Miss Cheerleader USA, claimed in a ''New York'' magazine cover story that she was sexually assaulted by Trump in a [[Bergdorf Goodman]] department store dressing room in late 1995 or early 1996.\n\nCarroll wrote that they had met by chance in the department store, where he recognized her as \"that advice lady\", and that Trump had asked her to advise him on a present for \"a girl\". Trump took her to the lingerie section, where no one was around. Trump asked her to try on a piece of lingerie and took her to a dressing room; there he pushed her against a wall, causing her to hit her head \"quite badly\"; then he allegedly forcibly kissed her. Carroll then said, \"he{{nbsp}}... pulls down my tights{{nbsp}}... forcing his fingers around my private area, thrusts his penis halfway\u2014or completely, I'm not certain\u2014inside me\". After a struggle, she said she escaped from the dressing room and left the store. She said the incident lasted for no more than three minutes.\n\nCarroll wrote that Bergdorf Goodman no longer had security tapes from that period and that she did not report the incident to the police, but that also she had told two friends of hers. One told Carroll she had been [[rape]]d and to make a police report. The other told Carroll, \"Tell no one. Forget it! He has 200 lawyers. He'll bury you.\" Carroll's friends confirmed those conversations to ''New York''.\n\nTrump has given multiple responses, including: \"she's not my type\" and also saying he never met her. However, in her story, Carroll had provided a photograph of her meeting Trump in 1987, along with Carroll's then-husband [[John Johnson (reporter)|John Johnson]] and Trump's then-wife Ivana.\n\nThe two friends Carroll had confided in was revealed by the ''New York Times'' to be writer [[Lisa Birnbach]] and news anchor [[Carol Martin (journalist)|Carol Martin]], when they and Carroll appeared on the podcast of the ''New York Times'' taped on June 26, 2019, which narrated the following events: Carroll had remained silent for so long because she partially blamed herself for the incident, though she eventually stopped blaming herself. Carroll refused to say she was \"raped\", instead choosing to describe it thus: \"My word is fight. My word is not the victim word{{nbsp}}... Something has not been done to me. I fought.\"\n\nOn November 4, 2019, E.

A [[spiritual successor]] to 2004's ''[[Red Dead Revolver]]'', it is the second game in the ''[[Red Dead]]'' series, and was released for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] in May 2010. ''Red Dead Redemption'' is set during the decline of the [[American frontier]] in the year 1911 and follows [[John Marston (Red Dead)|John Marston]], a former outlaw whose wife and son are taken hostage by the government in ransom for his services as a hired gun. Having no other choice, Marston sets out to bring three members of his former gang to justice.\n\nThe game is played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]] in an [[open world]], allowing the player to interact with the game world at their leisure. The player can travel the virtual world, a fictionalized version of the [[Western United States]] and [[Mexico]], primarily by [[Equestrianism|horseback]] and on foot. Gunfights emphasize a [[gunslinger]] gameplay mechanic called \"[[Bullet time|Dead Eye]]\" that allows players to mark multiple shooting targets on enemies in slow motion. The game makes use of a morality system, by which the player's actions in the game affect their character's levels of honor and fame and how [[Non-player character|other characters]] respond to the player. An [[Multiplayer online game|online multiplayer]] mode is included with the game, allowing up to 16 players to engage in both [[cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] and competitive gameplay in a recreation of the single-player setting.\n\n''Red Dead Redemption'' was [[Development of Red Dead Redemption|developed]] over the course of five years and is one of the [[List of most expensive video games to develop|most expensive video games]] ever made. The game received critical acclaim for its visuals, dynamically-generated music, voice acting, gameplay, and story, and shipped over 15 million copies by 2017. It won several year-end accolades, including [[Game of the Year]] awards from several [[Video game journalism|gaming publications]], and is considered by critics as one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games ever made]]. After the game's release, several [[downloadable content]] additions were released; ''[[Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare]]'', later released as a standalone game, added a new single-player experience in which Marston searches for a cure for an infectious [[Zombie apocalypse|zombie plague]] that has swept across the Old West. A ''Game of the Year Edition'' containing all additional content was released in October 2011. A prequel, ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'', was released in October 2018 to similar acclaim.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Red Dead Redemption'' is a [[Western (genre)|Western]]-themed [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] game played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]]. The player controls [[John Marston (Red Dead)|John Marston]] and completes missions, linear scenarios with set objectives, to progress through the story. Outside of missions, players may [[Nonlinear gameplay|freely roam]] the [[open world]]. The player can interact with the environment and engage in combat with enemies, using various firearms. Different breeds of horses are the main forms of transportation, each with different attributes. These horses must be tamed in order to use them. The player can utilize trains for quick travelling, but they can also stop the train by threatening or killing the passengers or driver. The game's undeveloped land makes up the largest portion of the game world, featuring various rugged and vast landscapes with occasional travelers, bandits, and wildlife. Urban settlements range from isolated farmhouses to crowded towns. Besides the American West, the player can also traverse a fictional Mexican state bordering the United States.<ref name=\"Manual\"/>\n\nIn addition to following the main storyline, the player will witness and can take part in random events they encounter as they explore the game world. These include public hangings, ambushes, pleas for assistance, encounters with strangers, ride-by shootings, and dangerous animal attacks. For example, if a group of people ride into town firing guns in the air, Marston can kill them, and will receive a bonus of honor and fame for protecting the town. The player can also take part in optional side activities, most of which give the player money. These side activities include dueling, in which the player must be a [[Fast Draw|faster draw]] than their opponent; bounty hunting, where Marston can hunt down bounties on [[wanted poster]]s; herb collecting, which involves gathering exotic plants from around the game map for town medics; gambling, where people can be found playing games such as poker and [[Knife game|Five Finger Fillet]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/11841/rockstar-game-tips-becoming-an-ace-online-poker-player-red-dead-.html |title=Rockstar Games Tips: Becoming an Ace Online Poker Player (Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare Collection / Liars and Cheats Pack) |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |author=R* Y |date=November 16, 2010 |accessdate=April 4, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"kotaku eyeson\">{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5272049/red-dead-redemption-eyes-on-impressions |title=Red Dead Redemption Eyes-On Impressions |website=Kotaku |date=May 28, 2009 |first=Michael |last=McWhertor |accessdate=April 10, 2013}}</ref> and hunting, in which the player can kill wild animals and skin their hides.<ref name=\"kotaku eyeson\" />\n\n''Red Dead Redemption'' makes use of a morality system where players have the ability to gain positive or negative honor.<ref name=\"Manual\" >{{cite book |author=[[Rockstar San Diego]] |title=Red Dead Redemption ''Game Manual'' |url=http://epix.xbox.com/shaXam/0201/55/78/5578b04b-140d-4a53-bc07-091cf1b372c5.PDF?v=1#rdr-en.PDF |accessdate=April 10, 2013 |year=2010 |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]]}}</ref> Honor can be gained by making morally positive choices, such as taking in an outlaw alive or saving a woman from a kidnapping. The player's overall honor standard is lowered for committing crimes or other negative choices. This works in conjunction with another system, fame, which affects how people react based on Marston's honor status. If Marston has little honor, [[non-player character]]s will feel insecure around them. If they have a high amount of honor, other characters will usually greet them and feel safe around them. They will also receive discounts in some stores, more pay for jobs and other bonuses.<ref name=\"Manual\"/><ref>{{cite web |last=Cocker |first=Guy |url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/reddeadredemption/news.html?sid=6248188&mode=previews |title=Red Dead Redemption Hands-On\u2014Xbox 360 Previews at GameSpot |website=[[GameSpot]] |date=January 28, 2010 |accessdate=March 29, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601062455/http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/reddeadredemption/news.html?sid=6248188&mode=previews |archivedate=June 1, 2010}}</ref> A very low honor rating can result in a town's establishments closing their doors when Marston arrives. To combat this they can disguise themselves by wearing a [[bandana]] when performing criminal acts; alternatively, a very negative or criminal reputation warrants the player a large amount of respect and steep discounts from bandits and fencers at criminal hideouts, such as Thieves' Landing.<ref name=\"Manual\"/>\n\n=== Combat ===\n[[File:RedDeadRedemptionGameplay.jpg|thumb|left|''Red Dead Redemption'' features a [[cover system]] that lets the player hide behind objects and reach out to fire on people and animals.]]\nGunfights are a major gameplay mechanic in ''Red Dead Redemption''. The player can take cover, target a specific person or animal, [[blindfire]], and free aim. Individual body parts can also be targeted, in order to take targets down non-lethally. When the player shoots an enemy, the game engine uniquely creates the [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|AI]] reactions and movements depending on where they were hit. The player can choose from period-accurate weapons including revolvers, pistols, lever or bolt-action rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, knives, explosives, lassos, mounted [[Gatling gun]]s, and cannons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockstargames.com/reddeadredemption/features/weapons/ |title=Features: Weapons |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |date= |accessdate=March 29, 2010}}</ref> Duels utilize a [[gunslinger]] gameplay mechanic known as Dead Eye. Dead Eye is a targeting system that is used in a [[bullet time]]-like manner, allowing the player to slow down time to place a precise shot or paint in multiple shots. When the targeting sequence ends, Marston automatically fires to all marked locations in extremely quick succession.<ref name=\"Manual\"/>\n\nAdopted from the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]], ''Red Dead Redemption'' has a modified wanted system. When the player commits a crime, such as killing people near witnesses, some will run to the nearest police station. The player can either bribe or kill them before they reach the station, negating any consequences. If a crime is committed near a lawman or constable, the wanted meter immediately appears along with a bounty count which increases with each crime committed. The higher the bounty, the more lawmen will be sent after the player. If they kill enough pursuers, then either [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals]] or the [[Mexican Army]], depending on their location, will be sent instead. To evade law enforcement in pursuit, the player must escape a circular zone until the wanted meter disappears. Alternatively, the player can kill all lawmen in a town to have the wanted meter disappear.<ref name=\"Manual\"/> Regardless of whether they escape capture, a bounty is placed upon the player which will cause bounty hunters to come after them in the wilderness. It is impossible to surrender to these bounty hunters by putting away the player's weapon and standing still as they will kill them regardless. Only lawmen in towns and [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posses]] will accept surrenders. The law will continue to chase the player, unless they pay their bounty at a [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] station or presents a pardon letter. When arrested, the player pays off their bounty, spends a certain number of days in jail depending on the severity of their crimes, and is then released. If the player does not have enough money to pay back the bounty, the law will assign bounty hunting activities to complete until enough money is earned.<ref name=\"Manual\"/>\n\n=== Multiplayer ===\n''Red Dead Redemption'' includes online multiplayer with a maximum of 16 players per session. Every multiplayer game, both free-for-all and team based, will begin with a [[Mexican standoff]]. Survivors of the standoff will be able to move to any part of the battlefield in preparation for respawning enemies. Crates in the environment contain extra weapons, ammo, and other [[powerup]]s. Players can level up and complete weapon challenges which earn them rewards such as new character models, golden weapon skins, new titles, and new breeds of [[Riding animal|animal mounts]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/04/08/red-dead-redemption-online-free-roam-multiplayer-revealed/ |title=Red Dead Redemption's online 'Multiplayer Free Roam' revealed |first=Andrew |last=Yoon |publisher=Joystiq |accessdate=April 8, 2010 |date=April 8, 2010}}</ref> Additional multiplayer modes were added via [[downloadable content]] (DLC).

New Austin and West Elizabeth are adjacent to each other and share a southern border with Mexico. Nuevo Paraiso is a Mexican state, separated from U.S. territory by the San Luis River. The game takes place primarily in the year 1911, featuring the final decade of the [[American frontier]] and the cowboy and outlaw archetypes that shaped it. The landscape of the Wild West is beginning to fade and modern technologies like automobiles, machine guns, and oil drilling projects are beginning to appear.\n\n===Plot===\n{{See also|List of Red Dead Redemption characters}}\nThe game begins in 1911, where former outlaw John Marston ([[Rob Wiethoff]]) is taken from his family by [[Bureau of Investigation]] agents Edgar Ross (Jim Bentley) and his partner, Archer Fordham ([[David Wilson Barnes]]), and will only be granted amnesty when he brings the remaining members of his old gang to justice. John is escorted to the town of Armadillo and sets off to track down former ally Bill Williamson ([[Steve J. Palmer]]). He confronts Williamson and his men at their stronghold, Fort Mercer, only to be shot and left for dead. Local rancher Bonnie MacFarlane (Kimberly Irion) finds him critically wounded and takes him to her ranch for recovery. Several days later, John begins performing tasks and favors for various allies in exchange for their help with organizing an attack on Fort Mercer. John and his group then breach the fort and defeat Williamson's gang only to find that Williamson has fled to Mexico to seek help from Javier Escuella (Antonio Jaramillo), another former member of John's gang.\n\nIn Mexico, John initially sides with Mexican Army Colonel Agust\u00edn Allende (Gary Carlos Cervantes) to help end a rebellion in return for Allende delivering Escuella and Williamson to him. However, Allende betrays John, who then sides with the rebels. John, along with rebel leader Abraham Reyes ([[Josh Segarra]]), eventually turns the tide in favor of the rebels, launching an assault on the El Presidio fortress. They find Escuella, who attempts to bargain for his life by revealing that Williamson has been under Allende's protection. John is given the option to either kill Escuella or turn him over to the Bureau. John and Reyes then take the fight to Allende. As Allende's palace is stormed by the rebels, both he and Williamson flee but are apprehended and killed. Reyes takes charge of the local government and plans to advance on the capital, while John leaves to meet with the Bureau in Blackwater.\n\nRoss and Fordham refuse to let John return to his family until he assists the Bureau in hunting down the only remaining member of his previous gang who is still active as an outlaw: its leader and John's surrogate father, Dutch van der Linde ([[Benjamin Byron Davis]]). After surviving several ambushes and thwarting a bank robbery, John joins Ross, Fordham, and a group of U.S. soldiers in an attack on Dutch's hideout. During the assault, John chases Dutch up to a cliff, where the latter, mortally wounded, warns John that the Bureau won't let him have peace and then commits suicide by backing off the cliff.\n\nJohn is released from his deal and returns home to his wife Abigail (Sophie Marzocchi) and son Jack ([[Josh Blaylock]]). John devotes his time tending to the ranch, having sworn to keep himself and his family away from the outlaw lifestyle forever. However, true to Dutch's word, Ross double-crosses John and leads a combined force of soldiers, lawmen, and government agents after him. John fends off several waves of attackers and gets his family to safety, but stays behind to hold back the rest. Despite a valiant last stand, he dies after being shot numerous times by Ross and his men and is buried by his family on the hill overlooking the ranch.\n\nThree years later in 1914, following the death of his mother, Jack tracks down the now-retired Ross and kills him in a duel, avenging his father and continuing the path of violence his father had tried to keep away from him. The fates of John's companions are later summarized in newspaper articles and NPC dialog: Marshal Leigh Johnson retired from Armadillo at age 54 and moved away, Reyes was consumed by power and became a tyrant, Bonnie MacFarlane eventually married, Irish shot himself dead in an outhouse when his gun accidentally discharged, Seth Briars eventually found treasure and became rich, and Landon Ricketts died quietly in his sleep.\n\n==Development==\n{{Main|Development of Red Dead Redemption}}\n\n[[Rockstar San Diego]] began to [[Development of Red Dead Redemption|develop ''Red Dead Redemption'']] in 2005.

A [[spiritual successor]] to 2004's ''[[Red Dead Revolver]]'', it is the second game in the ''[[Red Dead]]'' series, and was released for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] in May 2010. ''Red Dead Redemption'' is set during the decline of the [[American frontier]] in the year 1911 and follows [[John Marston (Red Dead)|John Marston]], a former outlaw whose wife and son are taken hostage by the government in ransom for his services as a hired gun. Having no other choice, Marston sets out to bring three members of his former gang to justice.\n\nThe game is played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]] in an [[open world]], allowing the player to interact with the game world at their leisure. The player can travel the virtual world, a fictionalized version of the [[Western United States]] and [[Mexico]], primarily by [[Equestrianism|horseback]] and on foot. Gunfights emphasize a [[gunslinger]] gameplay mechanic called \"[[Bullet time|Dead Eye]]\" that allows players to mark multiple shooting targets on enemies in slow motion. The game makes use of a morality system, by which the player's actions in the game affect their character's levels of honor and fame and how [[Non-player character|other characters]] respond to the player. An [[Multiplayer online game|online multiplayer]] mode is included with the game, allowing up to 16 players to engage in both [[cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] and competitive gameplay in a recreation of the single-player setting.\n\n''Red Dead Redemption'' was [[Development of Red Dead Redemption|developed]] over the course of five years and is one of the [[List of most expensive video games to develop|most expensive video games]] ever made. The game received critical acclaim for its visuals, dynamically-generated music, voice acting, gameplay, and story, and shipped over 15 million copies by 2017. It won several year-end accolades, including [[Game of the Year]] awards from several [[Video game journalism|gaming publications]], and is considered by critics as one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games ever made]]. After the game's release, several [[downloadable content]] additions were released; ''[[Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare]]'', later released as a standalone game, added a new single-player experience in which Marston searches for a cure for an infectious [[Zombie apocalypse|zombie plague]] that has swept across the Old West. A ''Game of the Year Edition'' containing all additional content was released in October 2011. A prequel, ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'', was released in October 2018 to similar acclaim.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Red Dead Redemption'' is a [[Western (genre)|Western]]-themed [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] game played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]]. The player controls [[John Marston (Red Dead)|John Marston]] and completes missions, linear scenarios with set objectives, to progress through the story. Outside of missions, players may [[Nonlinear gameplay|freely roam]] the [[open world]]. The player can interact with the environment and engage in combat with enemies, using various firearms. Different breeds of horses are the main forms of transportation, each with different attributes. These horses must be tamed in order to use them. The player can utilize trains for quick travelling, but they can also stop the train by threatening or killing the passengers or driver. The game's undeveloped land makes up the largest portion of the game world, featuring various rugged and vast landscapes with occasional travelers, bandits, and wildlife. Urban settlements range from isolated farmhouses to crowded towns. Besides the American West, the player can also traverse a fictional Mexican state bordering the United States.<ref name=\"Manual\"/>\n\nIn addition to following the main storyline, the player will witness and can take part in random events they encounter as they explore the game world. These include public hangings, ambushes, pleas for assistance, encounters with strangers, ride-by shootings, and dangerous animal attacks. For example, if a group of people ride into town firing guns in the air, Marston can kill them, and will receive a bonus of honor and fame for protecting the town. The player can also take part in optional side activities, most of which give the player money. These side activities include dueling, in which the player must be a [[Fast Draw|faster draw]] than their opponent; bounty hunting, where Marston can hunt down bounties on [[wanted poster]]s; herb collecting, which involves gathering exotic plants from around the game map for town medics; gambling, where people can be found playing games such as poker and [[Knife game|Five Finger Fillet]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/11841/rockstar-game-tips-becoming-an-ace-online-poker-player-red-dead-.html |title=Rockstar Games Tips: Becoming an Ace Online Poker Player (Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare Collection / Liars and Cheats Pack) |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |author=R* Y |date=November 16, 2010 |accessdate=April 4, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"kotaku eyeson\">{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5272049/red-dead-redemption-eyes-on-impressions |title=Red Dead Redemption Eyes-On Impressions |website=Kotaku |date=May 28, 2009 |first=Michael |last=McWhertor |accessdate=April 10, 2013}}</ref> and hunting, in which the player can kill wild animals and skin their hides.<ref name=\"kotaku eyeson\" />\n\n''Red Dead Redemption'' makes use of a morality system where players have the ability to gain positive or negative honor.<ref name=\"Manual\" >{{cite book |author=[[Rockstar San Diego]] |title=Red Dead Redemption ''Game Manual'' |url=http://epix.xbox.com/shaXam/0201/55/78/5578b04b-140d-4a53-bc07-091cf1b372c5.PDF?v=1#rdr-en.PDF |accessdate=April 10, 2013 |year=2010 |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]]}}</ref> Honor can be gained by making morally positive choices, such as taking in an outlaw alive or saving a woman from a kidnapping. The player's overall honor standard is lowered for committing crimes or other negative choices. This works in conjunction with another system, fame, which affects how people react based on Marston's honor status. If Marston has little honor, [[non-player character]]s will feel insecure around them. If they have a high amount of honor, other characters will usually greet them and feel safe around them. They will also receive discounts in some stores, more pay for jobs and other bonuses.<ref name=\"Manual\"/><ref>{{cite web |last=Cocker |first=Guy |url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/reddeadredemption/news.html?sid=6248188&mode=previews |title=Red Dead Redemption Hands-On\u2014Xbox 360 Previews at GameSpot |website=[[GameSpot]] |date=January 28, 2010 |accessdate=March 29, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601062455/http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/reddeadredemption/news.html?sid=6248188&mode=previews |archivedate=June 1, 2010}}</ref> A very low honor rating can result in a town's establishments closing their doors when Marston arrives. To combat this they can disguise themselves by wearing a [[bandana]] when performing criminal acts; alternatively, a very negative or criminal reputation warrants the player a large amount of respect and steep discounts from bandits and fencers at criminal hideouts, such as Thieves' Landing.<ref name=\"Manual\"/>\n\n=== Combat ===\n[[File:RedDeadRedemptionGameplay.jpg|thumb|left|''Red Dead Redemption'' features a [[cover system]] that lets the player hide behind objects and reach out to fire on people and animals.]]\nGunfights are a major gameplay mechanic in ''Red Dead Redemption''. The player can take cover, target a specific person or animal, [[blindfire]], and free aim. Individual body parts can also be targeted, in order to take targets down non-lethally. When the player shoots an enemy, the game engine uniquely creates the [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|AI]] reactions and movements depending on where they were hit. The player can choose from period-accurate weapons including revolvers, pistols, lever or bolt-action rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, knives, explosives, lassos, mounted [[Gatling gun]]s, and cannons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockstargames.com/reddeadredemption/features/weapons/ |title=Features: Weapons |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |date= |accessdate=March 29, 2010}}</ref> Duels utilize a [[gunslinger]] gameplay mechanic known as Dead Eye. Dead Eye is a targeting system that is used in a [[bullet time]]-like manner, allowing the player to slow down time to place a precise shot or paint in multiple shots. When the targeting sequence ends, Marston automatically fires to all marked locations in extremely quick succession.<ref name=\"Manual\"/>\n\nAdopted from the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]], ''Red Dead Redemption'' has a modified wanted system. When the player commits a crime, such as killing people near witnesses, some will run to the nearest police station. The player can either bribe or kill them before they reach the station, negating any consequences. If a crime is committed near a lawman or constable, the wanted meter immediately appears along with a bounty count which increases with each crime committed. The higher the bounty, the more lawmen will be sent after the player. If they kill enough pursuers, then either [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals]] or the [[Mexican Army]], depending on their location, will be sent instead. To evade law enforcement in pursuit, the player must escape a circular zone until the wanted meter disappears. Alternatively, the player can kill all lawmen in a town to have the wanted meter disappear.<ref name=\"Manual\"/> Regardless of whether they escape capture, a bounty is placed upon the player which will cause bounty hunters to come after them in the wilderness. It is impossible to surrender to these bounty hunters by putting away the player's weapon and standing still as they will kill them regardless. Only lawmen in towns and [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posses]] will accept surrenders. The law will continue to chase the player, unless they pay their bounty at a [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] station or presents a pardon letter. When arrested, the player pays off their bounty, spends a certain number of days in jail depending on the severity of their crimes, and is then released. If the player does not have enough money to pay back the bounty, the law will assign bounty hunting activities to complete until enough money is earned.<ref name=\"Manual\"/>\n\n=== Multiplayer ===\n''Red Dead Redemption'' includes online multiplayer with a maximum of 16 players per session. Every multiplayer game, both free-for-all and team based, will begin with a [[Mexican standoff]]. Survivors of the standoff will be able to move to any part of the battlefield in preparation for respawning enemies. Crates in the environment contain extra weapons, ammo, and other [[powerup]]s. Players can level up and complete weapon challenges which earn them rewards such as new character models, golden weapon skins, new titles, and new breeds of [[Riding animal|animal mounts]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/04/08/red-dead-redemption-online-free-roam-multiplayer-revealed/ |title=Red Dead Redemption's online 'Multiplayer Free Roam' revealed |first=Andrew |last=Yoon |publisher=Joystiq |accessdate=April 8, 2010 |date=April 8, 2010}}</ref> Additional multiplayer modes were added via [[downloadable content]] (DLC).

Many [[capture the flag]] variants are also available. Hold Your Own is a traditional mode where each team has to defend their bag of gold from the enemy team whilst capturing the other. Grab The Bag has both teams attacking one bag placed in a section of the map. Gold Rush is a free-for-all variant, trying to grab and keep as many bags as possible. The multiplayer portion ''Red Dead Redemption'' also features open world gameplay.<ref name=\"Manual\"/> All players in the server can form or join a group of other players, known as a posse, of up to eight players and take part in activities such as hunting or attacking computer-controlled gang hideouts or another player's posse.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockstargames.com/reddeadredemption/news/article/4551/watch_%22multiplayer_free_roam%22_-_the_new_red_dead_redemption_gameplay_series_video |title=Multiplayer in Red Dead Redemption |author=R* Q |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |accessdate=April 8, 2010 |date=April 8, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170815181821/http://www.rockstargames.com/reddeadredemption/restricted_content/restricted_content_agegated/ref?redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rockstargames.com%2Freddeadredemption%2Fnews%2Farticle%2F4551%2Fwatch_%2522multiplayer_free_roam%2522_-_the_new_red_dead_redemption_gameplay_series_video&hash=f33b1b6b71417d64b121e63bd2c6b0e4 |archive-date=August 15, 2017}}</ref> In some game modes, players are unable to kill other players.<ref name=\"Friendly Free Roam\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/10151/friendly-free-roam-coming-very-soon-to-red-dead-redemption-multi.html |title=Friendly Free Roam, Coming Very Soon to Red Dead Redemption Multiplayer |author=R* Q |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |date=October 8, 2010 |accessdate=October 18, 2016}}</ref>{{efn|name=\"Friendly\"|Rockstar addressed the game's [[Griefer|griefing]] problem by introducing a Friendly Free Roam in an update on October 23, 2010.<ref name=\"Friendly Free Roam\"/>}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Setting===\n''Red Dead Redemption'' spans New Austin and West Elizabeth, two [[List of fictional states of the United States|fictitious states of the United States]], as well as Nuevo Paraiso, a fictitious Mexican state. New Austin and West Elizabeth are adjacent to each other and share a southern border with Mexico. Nuevo Paraiso is a Mexican state, separated from U.S. territory by the San Luis River. The game takes place primarily in the year 1911, featuring the final decade of the [[American frontier]] and the cowboy and outlaw archetypes that shaped it. The landscape of the Wild West is beginning to fade and modern technologies like automobiles, machine guns, and oil drilling projects are beginning to appear.\n\n===Plot===\n{{See also|List of Red Dead Redemption characters}}\nThe game begins in 1911, where former outlaw John Marston ([[Rob Wiethoff]]) is taken from his family by [[Bureau of Investigation]] agents Edgar Ross (Jim Bentley) and his partner, Archer Fordham ([[David Wilson Barnes]]), and will only be granted amnesty when he brings the remaining members of his old gang to justice. John is escorted to the town of Armadillo and sets off to track down former ally Bill Williamson ([[Steve J. Palmer]]). He confronts Williamson and his men at their stronghold, Fort Mercer, only to be shot and left for dead. Local rancher Bonnie MacFarlane (Kimberly Irion) finds him critically wounded and takes him to her ranch for recovery. Several days later, John begins performing tasks and favors for various allies in exchange for their help with organizing an attack on Fort Mercer. John and his group then breach the fort and defeat Williamson's gang only to find that Williamson has fled to Mexico to seek help from Javier Escuella (Antonio Jaramillo), another former member of John's gang.\n\nIn Mexico, John initially sides with Mexican Army Colonel Agust\u00edn Allende (Gary Carlos Cervantes) to help end a rebellion in return for Allende delivering Escuella and Williamson to him. However, Allende betrays John, who then sides with the rebels. John, along with rebel leader Abraham Reyes ([[Josh Segarra]]), eventually turns the tide in favor of the rebels, launching an assault on the El Presidio fortress. They find Escuella, who attempts to bargain for his life by revealing that Williamson has been under Allende's protection. John is given the option to either kill Escuella or turn him over to the Bureau. John and Reyes then take the fight to Allende. As Allende's palace is stormed by the rebels, both he and Williamson flee but are apprehended and killed. Reyes takes charge of the local government and plans to advance on the capital, while John leaves to meet with the Bureau in Blackwater.\n\nRoss and Fordham refuse to let John return to his family until he assists the Bureau in hunting down the only remaining member of his previous gang who is still active as an outlaw: its leader and John's surrogate father, Dutch van der Linde ([[Benjamin Byron Davis]]). After surviving several ambushes and thwarting a bank robbery, John joins Ross, Fordham, and a group of U.S. soldiers in an attack on Dutch's hideout. During the assault, John chases Dutch up to a cliff, where the latter, mortally wounded, warns John that the Bureau won't let him have peace and then commits suicide by backing off the cliff.\n\nJohn is released from his deal and returns home to his wife Abigail (Sophie Marzocchi) and son Jack ([[Josh Blaylock]]). John devotes his time tending to the ranch, having sworn to keep himself and his family away from the outlaw lifestyle forever. However, true to Dutch's word, Ross double-crosses John and leads a combined force of soldiers, lawmen, and government agents after him. John fends off several waves of attackers and gets his family to safety, but stays behind to hold back the rest. Despite a valiant last stand, he dies after being shot numerous times by Ross and his men and is buried by his family on the hill overlooking the ranch.\n\nThree years later in 1914, following the death of his mother, Jack tracks down the now-retired Ross and kills him in a duel, avenging his father and continuing the path of violence his father had tried to keep away from him. The fates of John's companions are later summarized in newspaper articles and NPC dialog: Marshal Leigh Johnson retired from Armadillo at age 54 and moved away, Reyes was consumed by power and became a tyrant, Bonnie MacFarlane eventually married, Irish shot himself dead in an outhouse when his gun accidentally discharged, Seth Briars eventually found treasure and became rich, and Landon Ricketts died quietly in his sleep.\n\n==Development==\n{{Main|Development of Red Dead Redemption}}\n\n[[Rockstar San Diego]] began to [[Development of Red Dead Redemption|develop ''Red Dead Redemption'']] in 2005.

Erik Brudvig of [[IGN]] lauded the environmental details, noting the player can even scare a flock of birds from the bushes as they ride past. He also noted that the game's dynamic events, weather and ambient sounds provide a rich experience for players. He summarized by stating \"you can also expect a fantastic game that offers the Western experience we've all been waiting for.\"<ref name=\"ign review\" /> ''[[Game Informer]]'' called the scenery \"breathtaking\", and the cinematic cutscenes \"vastly improved\" over ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'', and named it the \"best-looking Rockstar game to date\".<ref name=\"GI\"/>\n\n[[File:Red Dead Redemption - Gameplay.ogv|thumb|left|300px|thumbtime=0:16|The portion of the game in which Marston enters Mexico was acclaimed by critics and players.

''Game Informer'' said that Rockstar \"[transposed] the ''Grand Theft Auto'' gameplay template onto a Wild West setting\".<ref name=\"GI\"/> ''[[Good Game (television series)|Good Game]]'' reviewer [[Stephanie Bendixsen|Stephanie \"Hex\" Bendixsen]] said that \"[Rockstar] really looked at what people liked and didn't like in their game design from [''Grand Theft Auto IV''], and included it here\".<ref name=\"GG\" >{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/goodgame/stories/s2914340.htm |title=Good Game stories&nbsp;\u2014 Red Dead Redemption |author=''[[Good Game (television series)|Good Game]]'' |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=May 31, 2010}}</ref> [[Eurogamer]]'s Simon Parkin felt ''Red Dead Redemption'' successfully \"re-clothes\" the ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' framework in an \"exciting, distinct and expertly realised scenario\".<ref name=\"eurogamer review\" />\n\nThe multiplayer aspect of ''Red Dead Redemption'' received mixed commentary from critics. ''[[GamePro]]''{{'}}s Will Herring praised the variety of multiplayer modes and the open gameplay, but noted that it put more responsibility on the players for keeping the game interesting.<ref name=\"gamepro review\" /> Justin Calvert of [[GameSpot]] also gave high marks for the game's variety of multiplayer modes, but felt that there was a lack in customization options for players.<ref name=\"GSpotReview\" /> In a more critical view of multiplayer, Scott Sharkey of [[1UP.com]] noted that games can suffer from [[Griefer|griefing]]{{efn|name=\"Friendly\"}} due to the open nature of multiplayer gameplay. He also criticized the [[Experience point|leveling]] and unlocking aspects, noting that \"The first few minutes spent as a toothless miner riding a balky mule can be pretty humiliating\".<ref name=\"1up review\" /> [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4TV]]'s Jake Gaskill echoed this sentiment. He noted that the game often [[Spawning (video game)|respawns]] players in a similar location to their death, which allows the killing player to repeatedly grief the other player.<ref name=\"g4tv review\">{{cite web |url=http://g4tv.com/games/xbox-360/57148/Red-Dead-Redemption/review/ |title=Red Dead Redemption Review |first=Jake |last=Gaskill |publisher=[[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4TV]] |date=May 17, 2010 |accessdate=May 18, 2010}}</ref> Rockstar has since added a feature which allows for players being griefed to transport to another area upon respawn.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/7.216461-Rockstar-Bringing-New-Law-to-Red-Dead-Redemptions-Multiplayer |title=The Escapist: Forums: The News Room: Rockstar Bringing New Law to Red Dead Redemption's Multiplayer |accessdate=March 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Accolades ===\nSince its release, ''Red Dead Redemption'' has received a large number of awards.

Her great grandfather was [[Abraham Ogden]] of New Jersey, and she was also descended from the original Nonconformist [[Philip Henry]].\n\n== Education ==\nShe was educated in [[London]] and at [[Newnham College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].\n\n== Career ==\nOriginally a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]], she was a member of the [[London County Council]] 1910\u20131912, but after coming under the influence of the trades unionist [[Mary Macarthur]] she was converted to socialism, and rejoined the council as a Labour member from 1913\u20131927, becoming deputy chairman of the LCC 1925\u201326. She joined the [[Fabian Society]], becoming close to [[Sidney Webb]], and especially to his wife [[Beatrice Webb]]. During the First World War, she principally worked to improve the conditions of women factory workers.\n\nAs a member of the local council in [[Poplar, London]] (1919\u201324), led at the time by [[George Lansbury]], Lawrence was part of the Labour group that defied central government and refused to set a rate, arguing that the poverty in the area meant that the poor were being asked to pay for the poor. Lawrence was imprisoned for five weeks in [[Holloway (HM Prison)|Holloway Prison]] in 1921, but ultimately she and her fellow councillors' campaign succeeded, in that government passed a law to equalise [[Poor Law]] rates.\n\nLawrence first stood, unsuccessfully, for [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] at [[Camberwell North West (UK Parliament constituency)|Camberwell North West]] at a [[by-election]] in 1920, but won [[East Ham North (UK Parliament constituency)|East Ham North]] in the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 election]] which saw the first Labour government take office in the January of the following year.

The minority government lasted only nine months; following the [[Zinoviev letter]], the Labour Party lost the [[1924 United Kingdom general election|election of October 1924]] and Lawrence was personally defeated. However, the Conservative victor, [[Charles Williamson Crook]], died only 18 months later and Lawrence was easily re-elected at a by-election in April 1926.\n\nIn 1924, Lawrence visited Soviet Russia and spent six months travelling widely. Unlike the Webbs and other Fabians who went to Russia she did not believe everything the Bolsheviks alleged to foreign visitors, but tried to make contact with a wide variety of people, and she retained a critical attitude towards the Soviet system.<ref>Manchester Guardian 18 Sep 1924</ref>\n\nSusan Lawrence was appointed [[Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health]] in the second minority Labour Government elected in 1929. She was also the chair of the Labour Party Conference in [[Llandudno]] in 1930 - the first woman to hold the position. Like the vast majority of Labour MPs in Parliament, she refused to take part in [[Ramsay MacDonald]]'s [[First National ministry|National Government]] in the summer of 1931, and she lost her seat in the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]], never again to be a Member of Parliament.<ref>Manchester Guardian 18 Sep 1924</ref>\n\nIn 1935, Lawrence visited Palestine and was impressed by [[kibbutzim]] and Zionism in general. She subsequently tried, not very successfully, to persuade the Labour Party Conference that a socialist utopia was being created in Palestine which was benefitting Jewish and Arab workers alike. But, as always, her interest was not merely emotional, but practical and based on facts. In May 1936, the government appointed a Royal Commission under Lord Peel to investigate how the mandate was working in view of much communal strife between Jews and Arabs. Just before this finished its work in early 1937, Susan wrote a memorandum for the Labour Party's Advisory Committee on Imperial Affairs, on whose Palestine sub-committee she sat, stressing the problems arising for the Arabs because Jewish development was going so far ahead. The Mandate authorities, she felt, had neglected Arab needs for public works, land reclamation, and agricultural modernisation. Although the Palestine sub-committee had hoped for reconciliation rather than partition, by 1938 she was persuaded by labour leaders in Palestine to submit to the Labour party executive a memorandum saying that in the circumstances as they were, some form of partition was inevitable, and she hoped that the ensuing Jewish state would become affiliated to the Commonwealth.<ref>The British Labour Party and Zionism, 1917-1947, Fred Denis Lepkin, 1986, and The British Labour Movement and Zionism, 1917-1948, Joseph Gorny, 2013</ref>\n\nMaintaining her work in the Labour Party, Lawrence was a member of the National Executive until 1941, and devoted much of her time to working with the blind for the remainder of her life. The detective novelist [[Cyril Hare]] and [[General]] [[George Giffard|Sir George Giffard]] were among her nephews. Lucy Norton, the translator of the writings of [[Louis de Rouvroy, Duc de Saint-Simon]], and [[Lesley Lewis (art historian)|Lesley Lewis]], art historian and author of ''The Private Life of a [[English country house|Country House]]'', were among her nieces.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Lewis, Lesley.

Unlike the Webbs and other Fabians who went to Russia she did not believe everything the Bolsheviks alleged to foreign visitors, but tried to make contact with a wide variety of people, and she retained a critical attitude towards the Soviet system.<ref>Manchester Guardian 18 Sep 1924</ref>\n\nSusan Lawrence was appointed [[Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health]] in the second minority Labour Government elected in 1929. She was also the chair of the Labour Party Conference in [[Llandudno]] in 1930 - the first woman to hold the position. Like the vast majority of Labour MPs in Parliament, she refused to take part in [[Ramsay MacDonald]]'s [[First National ministry|National Government]] in the summer of 1931, and she lost her seat in the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]], never again to be a Member of Parliament.<ref>Manchester Guardian 18 Sep 1924</ref>\n\nIn 1935, Lawrence visited Palestine and was impressed by [[kibbutzim]] and Zionism in general. She subsequently tried, not very successfully, to persuade the Labour Party Conference that a socialist utopia was being created in Palestine which was benefitting Jewish and Arab workers alike. But, as always, her interest was not merely emotional, but practical and based on facts. In May 1936, the government appointed a Royal Commission under Lord Peel to investigate how the mandate was working in view of much communal strife between Jews and Arabs. Just before this finished its work in early 1937, Susan wrote a memorandum for the Labour Party\u2019s Advisory Committee on Imperial Affairs, on whose Palestine sub-committee she sat, stressing the problems arising for the Arabs because Jewish development was going so far ahead. The Mandate authorities, she felt, had neglected Arab needs for public works, land reclamation, and agricultural modernisation. Although the Palestine sub-committee had hoped for reconciliation rather than partition, by 1938 she was persuaded by labour leaders in Palestine to submit to the Labour party executive a memorandum saying that in the circumstances as they were, some form of partition was inevitable, and she hoped that the ensuing Jewish state would become affiliated to the Commonwealth.<ref>The British Labour Party and Zionism, 1917-1947, Fred Denis Lepkin, 1986, and The British Labour Movement and Zionism, 1917-1948, Joseph Gorny, 2013</ref>\n\nMaintaining her work in the Labour Party, Lawrence was a member of the National Executive until 1941, and devoted much of her time to working with the blind for the remainder of her life. The detective novelist [[Cyril Hare]] and [[General]] [[George Giffard|Sir George Giffard]] were among her nephews.

The team brought their record to 23\u201359 and improved upon their record of 20\u201362 from the team's final season in Seattle. The late-season successes of the Thunder contributed to the signing of Scott Brooks as the team's official head coach.\n\nAfter moving to Oklahoma City from Seattle, the team's operating situation improved markedly.

Oklahoma City did not make any major moves in the off-season, other than drafting [[James Harden (basketball)|James Harden]] from [[Arizona State University]] with the third overall pick in the [[2009 NBA draft|NBA Draft]]. The Thunder selected [[Rodrigue Beaubois]] with the 25th pick in the 2009 draft before immediately trading him to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] for the 24th pick, center [[Byron Mullens]] from [[Ohio State University]]. The team then added veteran center [[Etan Thomas]] and guard [[Kevin Ollie]]. The last major change to their roster occurred on December 22, 2009, when the team traded for [[Eric Maynor]] from the [[Utah Jazz]]. Maynor immediately supplanted Ollie as the backup point guard.\n\nFrom the outset the young team looked determined and cohesive. The increasing leadership of [[Kevin Durant]], along with the growing experience of the Thunder's younger players, including future [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]]s [[Russell Westbrook]] and [[James Harden]], were signs of the Thunder's improvement. The 2009\u201310 season included several victories over the NBA's elite teams, including a 28-point blowout over the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] champion [[Orlando Magic]] and a 16-point blowout of the reigning NBA champion [[Los Angeles Lakers]].

He missed 16 games, during which Oklahoma City went 4\u201312. During the middle of the season Westbrook and Durant both came back, and similarly suffered more injuries. Durant was ruled out of the rest of the season in March, deciding to have foot surgery. Westbrook also had to undergo surgery in early March, to repair a fracture in the zygomatic arch bone of his right cheek. Several days later he returned and recorded several triple-doubles on his way to Western Conference Player of the Month honors from February to April. He also won the 2014\u20132015 NBA scoring title.

The Thunder selected [[Rodrigue Beaubois]] with the 25th pick in the 2009 draft before immediately trading him to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] for the 24th pick, center [[Byron Mullens]] from [[Ohio State University]]. The team then added veteran center [[Etan Thomas]] and guard [[Kevin Ollie]]. The last major change to their roster occurred on December 22, 2009, when the team traded for [[Eric Maynor]] from the [[Utah Jazz]]. Maynor immediately supplanted Ollie as the backup point guard.\n\nFrom the outset the young team looked determined and cohesive. The increasing leadership of [[Kevin Durant]], along with the growing experience of the Thunder's younger players, including future [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]]s [[Russell Westbrook]] and [[James Harden]], were signs of the Thunder's improvement.

Road victories over the [[San Antonio Spurs]], [[Utah Jazz]], [[Miami Heat]], [[Boston Celtics]] and [[Dallas Mavericks]] further enhanced their reputation. Though they hovered around .500 for the first half of the season, they went on a 9-game winning streak that sent them into serious playoff contention.
