Di\u1ec7m was [[Arrest and assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem|killed in a military coup]] led by general [[D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh]] in 1963, and a series of short-lived military governments followed. General [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u]] then led the country after a US-encouraged civilian presidential election from 1967 until 1975. The beginnings of the [[Vietnam War]] occurred in 1955 with an uprising by the newly organized [[National Liberation Front for South Vietnam]] (Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng), armed and supported by the [[North Vietnam]], with backing mainly from [[China]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. Larger escalation of the insurgency occurred in 1965 with [[Role of the United States in the Vietnam War|American intervention]] and the introduction of regular forces of [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]], followed by [[United States Army|Army]] units to supplement the cadre of military advisors guiding the [[Republic of Vietnam Military Forces|Southern armed forces]]. A [[Operation Rolling Thunder|regular bombing campaign]] over North Vietnam was conducted by offshore [[United States Navy|US Navy]] airplanes, warships, and aircraft carriers joined by [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] squadrons through 1966 and 1967. Fighting peaked up to that point during the [[Tet Offensive]] of February 1968, when there were over a million South Vietnamese soldiers and 500,000 [[United States Armed Forces|US soldiers]] in South Vietnam. Later on the war the initial guerrilla war turned into a more conventional fight as the balance of power became equalized. An even larger, armored invasion from the North commenced during the [[Easter Offensive]] following US ground-forces withdrawal, and had nearly overran some major northern cities until beaten back.\n\nDespite a truce agreement under the [[Paris Peace Accords]], concluded in January 1973, after a torturous five years of on and off negotiations, fighting continued almost immediately afterwards. The regular [[People's Army of Vietnam|North Vietnamese army]] and Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng auxiliaries launched a major [[1975 Spring Offensive|second combined-arms conventional invasion in 1975]]. Communist forces [[Fall of Saigon|overran Saigon]] on 30 April 1975, marking the end of the Republic of Vietnam. On 2 July 1976, the [[Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam]] (which had taken over administration of the country) and the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] (then the government of [[North Vietnam]]) merged to form the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]].\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Main|Names of Vietnam}}\nThe official name of the South Vietnamese state was ''Vi\u1ec7t Nam C\u1ed9ng h\u00f2a'' (Republic of Vietnam) and the French name was referred to as ''R\u00e9publique du Vi\u00eat Nam''.

A French governor-general (to\u00e0n quy\u1ec1n) in [[Hanoi]] administered all the five parts of Indochina ([[Tonkin]], [[Name of Vietnam|Annam]], [[Cochinchina]], [[Laos]], and [[Cambodia]]) while Cochinchina (Nam K\u1ef3) was under a French governor (th\u1ed1ng \u0111\u1ed1c), but the difference from the other parts with most indigenous intelligensia and wealthy were naturalized French (Tourane now \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng in the central third of Vietnam also enjoyed this privilege because this city was a concession too.) The northern third of Vietnam (then the [[colony]] (thu\u1ed9c \u0111\u1ecba) of [[Tonkin]] (B\u1eafc K\u1ef3) was under a French resident general (th\u1ed1ng s\u1ee9). Between Tonkin in the north and Cochinchina in the south was the protectorate (x\u1ee9 b\u1ea3o h\u1ed9) of [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]] (Trung K\u1ef3), under a French resident superior (kh\u00e2m s\u1ee9). A Vietnamese emperor, [[B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i]], residing in [[Hu\u1ebf]], was the nominal ruler of Annam and Tonkin, which had parallel French and Vietnamese systems of administration, but his influence was less in Tonkin than in Annam. Cochinchina had been annexed by France in 1862 and even elected a deputy to the [[French National Assembly]]. It was more [[\u00c9volu\u00e9|\"evolved\"]], and French interests were stronger than in other parts of Indochina, notably in the form of French-owned [[rubber plantation]]s. [[French Indochina in World War II|During World War II]], Indochina was administered by [[Vichy France]] and occupied by Japan in September 1940. Japanese troops [[Japanese coup d'\u00e9tat in French Indochina|overthrew the Vichy administration]] on 9 March 1945, Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i proclaimed Vietnam independent. When the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrendered]] on 16 August 1945, Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i abdicated, and Vi\u1ec7t Minh leader [[Ho Chi Minh|H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh]] proclaimed the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] (DRV) in Hanoi and the [[August Revolution|DRV controlled almost the entire country of Vietnam]]. In June 1946, [[France]] declared Cochinchina a republic, separate from the northern and central parts. A [[National Revolutionary Army|Chinese Kuomintang army]] arrived to occupy Vietnam's north of the [[16th parallel north]], while a British led force occupied the south in September. The British-led force facilitated the return of French forces who [[War in Vietnam (1945\u201346)|fought the Viet Minh]] for control of the cities and towns of the south. The [[French Indochina War]] began on 19 December 1946, with the French regaining control of Hanoi and many other cities.\n\nThe [[State of Vietnam]] was created through co-operation between [[anti-communist]] Vietnamese and the French government on 14 June 1949. Former emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i accepted the position of chief of state (''qu\u1ed1c tr\u01b0\u1edfng''). This was known as the \"B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i Solution\". The colonial struggle in Vietnam became part of the global [[Cold War]]. In 1950, China, the [[Soviet Union]] and other communist nations recognised the DRV while the United States and other non-communist states recognised the B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i government.\n\nIn July 1954, France and the Vi\u1ec7t Minh agreed at the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] that the Vietnam would be temporarily divided at [[17th parallel north]] and State of Vietnam would rule the territory south of the 17th parallel, pending unification on the basis of supervised elections in 1956. At the time of the conference, it was expected that the South would continue to be a French dependency. However, South Vietnamese Premier [[Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m]], who preferred American sponsorship to French, rejected the agreement. When Vietnam was divided, 800,000 to 1 million North Vietnamese, mainly (but not exclusively) Roman Catholics, sailed south as part of [[Operation Passage to Freedom]] due to a fear of religious persecution in the North.

Kennedy#Presidency|Kennedy administration]], due to its repression of Buddhists and military defeats by the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng. Notably, the [[Hu\u1ebf Ph\u1eadt \u0110\u1ea3n shootings]] of 8 May 1963 led to the [[Buddhist crisis]], provoking widespread protests and [[civil resistance]]. The situation came to a head when the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|Special Forces]] were sent to [[Xa Loi Pagoda raids|raid Buddhist temples across the country]], leaving a death toll estimated to be in the hundreds. Di\u1ec7m was [[Arrest and assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem|overthrown in a coup]] on 1 November 1963 with the tacit approval of the US.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nDi\u1ec7m's removal and assassination set off a period of political instability and declining legitimacy of the Saigon government. General [[D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh]] became president, but he was [[1964 South Vietnamese coup|ousted in January 1964]] by General [[Nguy\u1ec5n Kh\u00e1nh]]. [[Phan Kh\u1eafc S\u1eedu]] was named head of state, but power remained with a junta of generals led by Kh\u00e1nh, which soon fell to infighting. Meanwhile, the [[Gulf of Tonkin incident]] of 2 August 1964 led to a dramatic increase in direct American participation in the war, with nearly 200,000 troops deployed by the end of the year. Kh\u00e1nh sought to capitalize on the crisis with the [[V\u0169ng T\u00e0u Charter]], a new constitution that would have curtailed civil liberties and concentrated his power, but was forced to back down in the face of widespread protests and strikes. Coup attempts followed [[September 1964 South Vietnamese coup attempt|in September]] and [[1965 South Vietnamese coup|February 1965]], the latter resulting in Air Marshal [[Nguy\u1ec5n Cao K\u1ef3]] becoming prime minister and General [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u]] becoming nominal head of state.\n\nK\u1ef3 and Thieu functioned in those roles until 1967, bringing much-desired stability to the government. They imposed censorship and suspended civil liberties, and intensified anticommunist efforts. Under pressure from the US, they held elections for president and the legislature in 1967. The [[1967 South Vietnamese Senate election|Senate election]] took place on 2 September 1967. The [[1967 South Vietnamese presidential election|Presidential election]] took place on 3 September 1967, Thi\u1ec7u was elected president with 34% of the vote in a widely criticised poll. The [[1967 South Vietnamese parliamentary election|Parliamentary election]] took place on 22 October 1967.\n\nOn 31 January 1968, the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) and the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng broke the traditional truce accompanying the [[T\u1ebft]] (Lunar New Year) holiday. The [[Tet Offensive]] failed to spark a national uprising and was militarily disastrous. By bringing the war to South Vietnam's cities, however, and by demonstrating the continued strength of communist forces, it marked a turning point in US support for the government in South Vietnam. The new administration of [[Richard Nixon]] introduced a policy of [[Vietnamization]] to reduce US combat involvement and began negotiations with the North Vietnamese to end the war. Thi\u1ec7u used the aftermath of the Tet Offensive to sideline K\u1ef3, his chief rival.\n\nOn 26 March 1970 the government began to implement the Land-to-the-Tiller program of land reform with the US providing US$339m of the program's US$441m cost. Individual landholdings were limited to 15 hectares.\n\nUS and South Vietnamese forces launched a series of [[Cambodian campaign|attacks on PAVN/VC bases]] in [[Cambodia]] in April\u2013July 1970. South Vietnam launched an [[Operation Lam Son 719|invasion]] of North Vietnamese bases in [[Laos]] in February/March 1971 and were defeated by the PAVN in what was widely regarded as a setback for Vietnamization.\n\nThi\u1ec7u was reelected unopposed in the [[1971 South Vietnamese presidential election|Presidential election]] on 2 October 1971.\n\nNorth Vietnam launched a [[Easter Offensive|conventional invasion]] of South Vietnam in late March 1972 which was only finally repulsed by October with massive US air support.\n\n===1973\u20131975===\nIn accordance with the [[Paris Peace Accords]] signed on 27 January 1973, US military forces withdrew from South Vietnam at the end of March 1973 while PAVN forces in the South were permitted to remain in place.\n\nNorth Vietnamese leaders had expected that the ceasefire terms would favour their side, but as Saigon began to roll back the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng, they found it necessary to adopt a new strategy, hammered out at a series of meetings in Hanoi in March 1973, according to the memoirs of [[Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n Tr\u00e0]]. As the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng's top commander, Tr\u00e0 participated in several of these meetings. A plan to improve logistics was prepared so that the PAVN would be able to launch a massive invasion of the South, projected for 1976. A gas pipeline would be built from North Vietnam to the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng provisional capital in [[L\u1ed9c Ninh, B\u00ecnh Ph\u01b0\u1edbc|L\u1ed9c Ninh]], about {{convert|60|mi|km}} north of Saigon.\n\nOn 15 March 1973, US President [[Richard Nixon]] implied that the US would intervene militarily if the communist side violated the ceasefire. Public reaction was unfavorable, and on 4 June 1973 the [[US Senate]] passed the [[Case\u2013Church Amendment]] to prohibit such intervention. The [[1973 oil crisis|oil price shock of October 1973]] caused significant damage to the South Vietnamese economy. A spokesman for Thi\u1ec7u admitted in a TV interview that the government was being \"overwhelmed\" by the inflation caused by the oil shock, while an American businessman living in Saigon stated after the oil shock that attempting to make money in South Vietnam was \"like making love to a corpse\".<ref>Cooper, Andrew Scott ''The Oil Kings How the US, [[Iran]], and [[Saudi Arabia]] Changed the Balance of Power in the Middle East'', New York: Simon and Schuster, 2011 p.  205</ref> One consequence of the inflation was the South Vietnamese government had increasing difficulty in paying its soldiers and imposed restrictions on fuel and munition usage. After two clashes that left 55 South Vietnamese soldiers dead, President Thieu announced on 4 January 1974 that the war had restarted and that the Paris Peace Accord was no longer in effect. There were over 25,000 South Vietnamese casualties during the ceasefire period.<ref>[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=Article&id=1592 This Day in History 1974: Thieu announces war has resumed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225151920/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=Article&id=1592 |date=25 February 2009 }}</ref> Also in January 1974 China attacked South Vietnamese forces in the [[Battle of the Paracel Islands|Paracel Islands]] taking control of the islands.\n\nIn August 1974, Nixon was forced to resign as a result of the [[Watergate scandal]], and the [[US Congress]] voted to reduce assistance to South Vietnam from $1&nbsp;billion a year to $700&nbsp;million. By this time, the Ho Chi Minh trail, once an arduous mountain trek, had been upgraded into a drivable highway with gasoline stations.\n\nIn December 1974, the PAVN [[Battle of Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Long|launched an invasion at Phuoc Long]] to test two things: South Vietnamese combat strength and political will and whether the US would respond militarily. With no US military assistance forthcoming the ARVN were unable to hold and the PAVN successfully captured many of the districts around the provincial capital of Phuoc Long weakening ARVN resistance in stronghold areas. President Thieu later abandoned Phuoc Long in early January 1975. As a result, Phuoc Long was the first provincial capital to fall to the PAVN.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://worldhistoryproject.org/1974/12/13/battle-of-phuoc-long-begins|title=Battle of Phuoc Long Begins|website=World History Project|language=en|access-date=2019-04-09}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975, the PAVN launched an [[Battle of Ban Me Thuot|offensive at Ban Me Thuot]] in the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]], in the first phase of what became known as the [[Ho Chi Minh Campaign]]. The South Vietnamese unsuccessfully attempted a defence and counterattack but had few reserve forces, as well as a shortage of spare parts and ammunition. As a consequence, Thi\u1ec7u ordered a withdrawal of key army units from the Central Highlands, which exacerbated an already perilous military situation and undermined the confidence of the ARVN soldiers in their leadership. The retreat became a rout exacerbated by poor planning and conflicting orders from Thi\u1ec7u. PAVN forces also attacked south and from sanctuaries in Laos and Cambodia [[Hue\u2013Da Nang Campaign|capturing Hu\u1ebf and Da Nang]] and advanced southwards. As the military situation deteriorated, ARVN troops started deserting. By early April, South Vietnam had lost almost 3/5th of the country.\n\nThi\u1ec7u requested aid from US President [[Gerald Ford]], but the US Senate would not release extra money to provide aid to South Vietnam, and had already passed laws to prevent further involvement in Vietnam. In desperation, Thi\u1ec7u recalled K\u1ef3 from retirement as a military commander, but resisted calls to name his old rival prime minister.\n\n===Fall of Saigon: April 1975===\n{{main|Fall of Saigon|Operation Frequent Wind}}\n\nMorale was low in South Vietnam as the PAVN advanced. A last-ditch defense was made by the ARVN [[18th Division (South Vietnam)|18th Division]] at the [[Battle of Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c]] from 9\u201321 April. Thi\u1ec7u resigned on 21 April 1975, and fled to [[Taiwan]]. He nominated his Vice President [[Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n H\u01b0\u01a1ng]] as his successor. After only one week in office, the South Vietnamese national assembly voted to hand over the presidency to General D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh. Minh was seen as a more conciliatory figure toward the North, and it was hoped he might be able to negotiate a more favourable settlement to end the war. The North, however, was not interested in negotiations, and its forces [[Fall of Saigon|captured Saigon]]. Minh [[Unconditional surrender|unconditionally surrendered]] Saigon and the rest of South Vietnam to North Vietnam on 30 April 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1975/Fall-of-Saigon/12305821478075-2/|title=Fall of Saigon - 1975 Year in Review - Audio - UPI.com|website=UPI}}</ref>\n\nDuring the hours leading up to the surrender, the United States undertook a massive [[Operation Frequent Wind|evacuation]] of US government personnel as well as high-ranking members of the ARVN and other South Vietnamese who were seen as potential targets for persecution by the Communists. Many of the evacuees were taken directly by helicopter to multiple [[aircraft carrier]]s waiting off the coast. An iconic image of the evacuation is the widely seen footage of empty [[UH-1 Iroquois|Huey]] helicopters being jettisoned over the side of the carriers, to provide more room on the ship's deck for more evacuees to land.\n\n=== Provisional Revolutionary Government ===\n{{main|Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam}}\nFollowing the surrender of Saigon to North Vietnamese forces on 30 April 1975, the [[Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam]] officially became the government of South Vietnam. Subsequently, the provisional government and the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] would merge into the current government of [[Vietnam]] in 2 July 1976.\n\n== Government ==<!--This section is linked from [[Senate]]-->\n{{see|1955 State of Vietnam referendum|1959 South Vietnamese parliamentary election|1960 South Vietnamese coup attempt|1962 South Vietnamese Independence Palace bombing|Buddhist crisis|Hu\u1ebf Vesak shootings|X\u00e1 L\u1ee3i Pagoda raids|1963 South Vietnamese coup|Arrest and assassination of Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m|1964 South Vietnamese coup}}\n\nSouth Vietnam went through many political changes during its short life. Initially, former Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i served as [[Head of State]]. He was unpopular however, largely because monarchical leaders were considered collaborators during French rule and because he had spent his reign absent in France.\n\nIn 1955, Prime Minister Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m held a [[1955 State of Vietnam referendum|referendum]] to decide whether the State of Vietnam would remain a [[monarchy]] or become a republic. This referendum was blatantly rigged in favor of a republic. Not only did an implausible 98% vote in favor of deposing B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i, but over 380,000 more votes were cast than the total number of registered voters; in [[Saigon]], for instance, Di\u1ec7m was credited with 133% of the vote. Di\u1ec7m proclaimed himself the president of the newly formed Republic of Vietnam. Despite successes in politics, economics and social change in the first 5 years, Di\u1ec7m quickly became a dictatorial leader. With the support of the United States government and the [[CIA]], ARVN officers led by General D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh staged a coup and killed him in 1963. The military held a brief interim military government until General [[Nguy\u1ec5n Kh\u00e1nh]] [[1964 South Vietnamese coup|deposed Minh]] in a January 1964 coup. Until late 1965, multiple coups and changes of government occurred, with some civilians being allowed to give a semblance of civil rule overseen by a military junta.\n\nIn 1965, the feuding civilian government voluntarily resigned and handed power back to the nation's military, in the hope this would bring stability and unity to the nation. An elected constituent assembly including representatives of all the branches of the military decided to switch the nation's system of government to a Semi-Presidential system. Military rule initially failed to provide much stability however, as internal conflicts and political inexperience caused various factions of the army to launch coups and counter-coups against one another, making leadership very tumultuous. The situation within the ranks of the military stabilised in mid-1965 when the [[Republic of Vietnam Air Force]] chief Nguy\u1ec5n Cao K\u1ef3 became Prime Minister, with General Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u as the figurehead chief of state. As Prime Minister, K\u1ef3 consolidated control of the South Vietnamese government and ruled the country with an iron fist.<ref name=Farber>{{cite book|title=The Sixties Chronicle|author=David Farber|publisher=Legacy Publishing|year=2004|isbn=978-1412710091}}</ref>{{rp|273}}\n\nIn June 1965, K\u1ef3's influence over the ruling military government was solidified when he forced civilian prime minister [[Phan Huy Qu\u00e1t]] from power.<ref name=Farber/>{{rp|232}} Often praising aspects of Western culture in public,<ref name=Farber/>{{rp|264}} Ky was supported by the United States and its allied nations,<ref name=Farber/>{{rp|264}} though doubts began to circulate among Western officials by 1966 on whether or not Ky could maintain stability in South Vietnam.<ref name=Farber/>{{rp|264}} A repressive leader, Ky was greatly despised by his fellow countrymen.<ref name=Farber/>{{rp|273}} In early 1966, protesters influenced by popular [[Buddhist monk]] [[Th\u00edch Tr\u00ed Quang]] attempted an [[Buddhist Uprising|uprising]] in Quang's hometown of Da Nang.<ref name=Farber/>{{rp|273}} The uprising was unsuccessful and Ky's repressive stance towards the nation's Buddhist population continued.<ref name=Farber/>{{rp|273}}\n\nIn 1967, the [[unicameral]] [[1956 South Vietnamese Constitutional Assembly election|National Assembly]] was replaced by a [[bicameral]] system consisting of a [[1967 South Vietnamese parliamentary election|Parliament]] or Lower House (''Ha Nghi Vi\u1ec7n'') and a [[1967 South Vietnamese Senate election|Senate]] or Upper House (''Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng Nghi Vi\u1ec7n'') and South Vietnam held its first elections under the new system. The military nominated Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u as their candidate, and he was [[1967 South Vietnamese presidential election|elected]] with a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the popular vote. Thieu quickly consolidated power much to the dismay of those who hoped for an era of more political openness. He was [[1971 South Vietnamese presidential election|re-elected]] unopposed in 1971, receiving a suspiciously high 94% of the vote on an 87% turn-out. Thieu ruled until the final days of the war, resigning on 21 April 1975. Vice-President Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n H\u01b0\u01a1ng assumed power for a week, but on 27 April the Parliament and Senate voted to transfer power to D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh who was the nation's last president and who unconditionally surrendered to the Communist forces on 30 April 1975.\n\nThe National Assembly/Parliament was located in the Saigon Opera House, now the [[Municipal Theatre, Ho Chi Minh City]],<ref name=Doling>{{cite book|last=Doling|first=Tim|title=Exploring Saigon-Cholon \u2013 Vanishing Heritage of Ho Cho Minh City|publisher=Th\u1ebf Gi\u1edbi Publishers|year=2019|isbn=9786047761388}}</ref>{{rp|100}} while the Senate was located at 45-47 B\u1ebfn Ch\u01b0\u01a1ng Street (''B\u1ebfn Ch\u01b0\u01a1ng D\u01b0\u01a1ng''), District 1, originally the Chamber of Commerce, and now the [[Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange]].<ref name=Doling/>{{rp|218}}\n\nThe South Vietnamese government was regularly accused of holding large quantity of political prisoners, of which the exact number was a source of contention. [[Amnesty International]], in a report in 1973, gave the estimation of number of South Vietnam's civilian prisoners ranging from 35,257 (as confirmed by Saigon) to 200,000 or more. Among them, approximately 22,000\u201341,000 were accounted \"communist\" political prisoners.<ref>Report No. ASA 41/001/1973, [https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/204000/asa410011973en.pdf \"Political Prisoners in South Vietnam\"], Amnesty International, 1 January 1973, p. 6-8.</ref> Robert F.

Di\u1ec7m was [[Arrest and assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem|killed in a military coup]] led by general [[D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh]] in 1963, and a series of short-lived military governments followed. General [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u]] then led the country after a US-encouraged civilian presidential election from 1967 until 1975. The beginnings of the [[Vietnam War]] occurred in 1955 with an uprising by the newly organized [[National Liberation Front for South Vietnam]] (Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng), armed and supported by the [[North Vietnam]], with backing mainly from [[China]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. Larger escalation of the insurgency occurred in 1965 with [[Role of the United States in the Vietnam War|American intervention]] and the introduction of regular forces of [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]], followed by [[United States Army|Army]] units to supplement the cadre of military advisors guiding the [[Republic of Vietnam Military Forces|Southern armed forces]]. A [[Operation Rolling Thunder|regular bombing campaign]] over North Vietnam was conducted by offshore [[United States Navy|US Navy]] airplanes, warships, and aircraft carriers joined by [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] squadrons through 1966 and 1967. Fighting peaked up to that point during the [[Tet Offensive]] of February 1968, when there were over a million South Vietnamese soldiers and 500,000 [[United States Armed Forces|US soldiers]] in South Vietnam. Later on the war the initial guerrilla war turned into a more conventional fight as the balance of power became equalized. An even larger, armored invasion from the North commenced during the [[Easter Offensive]] following US ground-forces withdrawal, and had nearly overran some major northern cities until beaten back.\n\nDespite a truce agreement under the [[Paris Peace Accords]], concluded in January 1973, after a torturous five years of on and off negotiations, fighting continued almost immediately afterwards. The regular [[People's Army of Vietnam|North Vietnamese army]] and Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng auxiliaries launched a major [[1975 Spring Offensive|second combined-arms conventional invasion in 1975]]. Communist forces [[Fall of Saigon|overran Saigon]] on 30 April 1975, marking the end of the Republic of Vietnam. On 2 July 1976, the [[Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam]] (which had taken over administration of the country) and the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] (then the government of [[North Vietnam]]) merged to form the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]].\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Main|Names of Vietnam}}\nThe official name of the South Vietnamese state was ''Vi\u1ec7t Nam C\u1ed9ng h\u00f2a'' (Republic of Vietnam) and the French name was referred to as ''R\u00e9publique du Vi\u00eat Nam''.

A French governor-general (to\u00e0n quy\u1ec1n) in [[Hanoi]] administered all the five parts of Indochina ([[Tonkin]], [[Name of Vietnam|Annam]], [[Cochinchina]], [[Laos]], and [[Cambodia]]) while Cochinchina (Nam K\u1ef3) was under a French governor (th\u1ed1ng \u0111\u1ed1c), but the difference from the other parts with most indigenous intelligensia and wealthy were naturalized French (Tourane now \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng in the central third of Vietnam also enjoyed this privilege because this city was a concession too.) The northern third of Vietnam (then the [[colony]] (thu\u1ed9c \u0111\u1ecba) of [[Tonkin]] (B\u1eafc K\u1ef3) was under a French resident general (th\u1ed1ng s\u1ee9). Between Tonkin in the north and Cochinchina in the south was the protectorate (x\u1ee9 b\u1ea3o h\u1ed9) of [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]] (Trung K\u1ef3), under a French resident superior (kh\u00e2m s\u1ee9). A Vietnamese emperor, [[B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i]], residing in [[Hu\u1ebf]], was the nominal ruler of Annam and Tonkin, which had parallel French and Vietnamese systems of administration, but his influence was less in Tonkin than in Annam. Cochinchina had been annexed by France in 1862 and even elected a deputy to the [[French National Assembly]]. It was more [[\u00c9volu\u00e9|\"evolved\"]], and French interests were stronger than in other parts of Indochina, notably in the form of French-owned [[rubber plantation]]s. [[French Indochina in World War II|During World War II]], Indochina was administered by [[Vichy France]] and occupied by Japan in September 1940. Japanese troops [[Japanese coup d'\u00e9tat in French Indochina|overthrew the Vichy administration]] on 9 March 1945, Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i proclaimed Vietnam independent. When the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrendered]] on 16 August 1945, Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i abdicated, and Vi\u1ec7t Minh leader [[Ho Chi Minh|H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh]] proclaimed the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] (DRV) in Hanoi and the [[August Revolution|DRV controlled almost the entire country of Vietnam]]. In June 1946, [[France]] declared Cochinchina a republic, separate from the northern and central parts. A [[National Revolutionary Army|Chinese Kuomintang army]] arrived to occupy Vietnam's north of the [[16th parallel north]], while a British led force occupied the south in September. The British-led force facilitated the return of French forces who [[War in Vietnam (1945\u201346)|fought the Viet Minh]] for control of the cities and towns of the south. The [[French Indochina War]] began on 19 December 1946, with the French regaining control of Hanoi and many other cities.\n\nThe [[State of Vietnam]] was created through co-operation between [[anti-communist]] Vietnamese and the French government on 14 June 1949. Former emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i accepted the position of chief of state (''qu\u1ed1c tr\u01b0\u1edfng''). This was known as the \"B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i Solution\". The colonial struggle in Vietnam became part of the global [[Cold War]]. In 1950, China, the [[Soviet Union]] and other communist nations recognised the DRV while the United States and other non-communist states recognised the B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i government.\n\nIn July 1954, France and the Vi\u1ec7t Minh agreed at the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] that the Vietnam would be temporarily divided at [[17th parallel north]] and State of Vietnam would rule the territory south of the 17th parallel, pending unification on the basis of supervised elections in 1956. At the time of the conference, it was expected that the South would continue to be a French dependency. However, South Vietnamese Premier [[Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m]], who preferred American sponsorship to French, rejected the agreement. When Vietnam was divided, 800,000 to 1 million North Vietnamese, mainly (but not exclusively) Roman Catholics, sailed south as part of [[Operation Passage to Freedom]] due to a fear of religious persecution in the North. About 90,000 Vi\u1ec7t Minh were evacuated to the North while 5,000 to 10,000 cadre remained in the South, most of them with orders to refocus on political activity and agitation.<ref name=Pentagon>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon/pent14.htm |title=Origins of the Insurgency in South Vietnam, 1954\u20131960|work=The Pentagon Papers|year=1971|pages=242\u2013314}}</ref> The Saigon-Cholon Peace Committee, the first [[Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng]] front, was founded in 1954 to provide leadership for this group.<ref name=Pentagon/>\n\n===1955\u20131963===\n{{main|Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m}}\n{{see also|1955 State of Vietnam referendum|Battle of Saigon (1955)}}\n[[File:Ngo Dinh Diem at Washington - ARC 542189.jpg|thumb|US President [[Dwight D.

Kennedy#Presidency|Kennedy administration]], due to its repression of Buddhists and military defeats by the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng. Notably, the [[Hu\u1ebf Ph\u1eadt \u0110\u1ea3n shootings]] of 8 May 1963 led to the [[Buddhist crisis]], provoking widespread protests and [[civil resistance]]. The situation came to a head when the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|Special Forces]] were sent to [[Xa Loi Pagoda raids|raid Buddhist temples across the country]], leaving a death toll estimated to be in the hundreds. Di\u1ec7m was [[Arrest and assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem|overthrown in a coup]] on 1 November 1963 with the tacit approval of the US.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nDi\u1ec7m's removal and assassination set off a period of political instability and declining legitimacy of the Saigon government. General [[D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh]] became president, but he was [[1964 South Vietnamese coup|ousted in January 1964]] by General [[Nguy\u1ec5n Kh\u00e1nh]]. [[Phan Kh\u1eafc S\u1eedu]] was named head of state, but power remained with a junta of generals led by Kh\u00e1nh, which soon fell to infighting. Meanwhile, the [[Gulf of Tonkin incident]] of 2 August 1964 led to a dramatic increase in direct American participation in the war, with nearly 200,000 troops deployed by the end of the year. Kh\u00e1nh sought to capitalize on the crisis with the [[V\u0169ng T\u00e0u Charter]], a new constitution that would have curtailed civil liberties and concentrated his power, but was forced to back down in the face of widespread protests and strikes. Coup attempts followed [[September 1964 South Vietnamese coup attempt|in September]] and [[1965 South Vietnamese coup|February 1965]], the latter resulting in Air Marshal [[Nguy\u1ec5n Cao K\u1ef3]] becoming prime minister and General [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u]] becoming nominal head of state.\n\nK\u1ef3 and Thieu functioned in those roles until 1967, bringing much-desired stability to the government. They imposed censorship and suspended civil liberties, and intensified anticommunist efforts. Under pressure from the US, they held elections for president and the legislature in 1967. The [[1967 South Vietnamese Senate election|Senate election]] took place on 2 September 1967. The [[1967 South Vietnamese presidential election|Presidential election]] took place on 3 September 1967, Thi\u1ec7u was elected president with 34% of the vote in a widely criticised poll. The [[1967 South Vietnamese parliamentary election|Parliamentary election]] took place on 22 October 1967.\n\nOn 31 January 1968, the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) and the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng broke the traditional truce accompanying the [[T\u1ebft]] (Lunar New Year) holiday. The [[Tet Offensive]] failed to spark a national uprising and was militarily disastrous. By bringing the war to South Vietnam's cities, however, and by demonstrating the continued strength of communist forces, it marked a turning point in US support for the government in South Vietnam. The new administration of [[Richard Nixon]] introduced a policy of [[Vietnamization]] to reduce US combat involvement and began negotiations with the North Vietnamese to end the war. Thi\u1ec7u used the aftermath of the Tet Offensive to sideline K\u1ef3, his chief rival.\n\nOn 26 March 1970 the government began to implement the Land-to-the-Tiller program of land reform with the US providing US$339m of the program's US$441m cost. Individual landholdings were limited to 15 hectares.\n\nUS and South Vietnamese forces launched a series of [[Cambodian campaign|attacks on PAVN/VC bases]] in [[Cambodia]] in April\u2013July 1970. South Vietnam launched an [[Operation Lam Son 719|invasion]] of North Vietnamese bases in [[Laos]] in February/March 1971 and were defeated by the PAVN in what was widely regarded as a setback for Vietnamization.\n\nThi\u1ec7u was reelected unopposed in the [[1971 South Vietnamese presidential election|Presidential election]] on 2 October 1971.\n\nNorth Vietnam launched a [[Easter Offensive|conventional invasion]] of South Vietnam in late March 1972 which was only finally repulsed by October with massive US air support.\n\n===1973\u20131975===\nIn accordance with the [[Paris Peace Accords]] signed on 27 January 1973, US military forces withdrew from South Vietnam at the end of March 1973 while PAVN forces in the South were permitted to remain in place.\n\nNorth Vietnamese leaders had expected that the ceasefire terms would favour their side, but as Saigon began to roll back the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng, they found it necessary to adopt a new strategy, hammered out at a series of meetings in Hanoi in March 1973, according to the memoirs of [[Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n Tr\u00e0]]. As the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng's top commander, Tr\u00e0 participated in several of these meetings. A plan to improve logistics was prepared so that the PAVN would be able to launch a massive invasion of the South, projected for 1976. A gas pipeline would be built from North Vietnam to the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng provisional capital in [[L\u1ed9c Ninh, B\u00ecnh Ph\u01b0\u1edbc|L\u1ed9c Ninh]], about {{convert|60|mi|km}} north of Saigon.\n\nOn 15 March 1973, US President [[Richard Nixon]] implied that the US would intervene militarily if the communist side violated the ceasefire. Public reaction was unfavorable, and on 4 June 1973 the [[US Senate]] passed the [[Case\u2013Church Amendment]] to prohibit such intervention. The [[1973 oil crisis|oil price shock of October 1973]] caused significant damage to the South Vietnamese economy. A spokesman for Thi\u1ec7u admitted in a TV interview that the government was being \"overwhelmed\" by the inflation caused by the oil shock, while an American businessman living in Saigon stated after the oil shock that attempting to make money in South Vietnam was \"like making love to a corpse\".<ref>Cooper, Andrew Scott ''The Oil Kings How the US, [[Iran]], and [[Saudi Arabia]] Changed the Balance of Power in the Middle East'', New York: Simon and Schuster, 2011 p.  205</ref> One consequence of the inflation was the South Vietnamese government had increasing difficulty in paying its soldiers and imposed restrictions on fuel and munition usage. After two clashes that left 55 South Vietnamese soldiers dead, President Thieu announced on 4 January 1974 that the war had restarted and that the Paris Peace Accord was no longer in effect. There were over 25,000 South Vietnamese casualties during the ceasefire period.<ref>[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=Article&id=1592 This Day in History 1974: Thieu announces war has resumed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225151920/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=Article&id=1592 |date=25 February 2009 }}</ref> Also in January 1974 China attacked South Vietnamese forces in the [[Battle of the Paracel Islands|Paracel Islands]] taking control of the islands.\n\nIn August 1974, Nixon was forced to resign as a result of the [[Watergate scandal]], and the [[US Congress]] voted to reduce assistance to South Vietnam from $1&nbsp;billion a year to $700&nbsp;million. By this time, the Ho Chi Minh trail, once an arduous mountain trek, had been upgraded into a drivable highway with gasoline stations.\n\nIn December 1974, the PAVN [[Battle of Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Long|launched an invasion at Phuoc Long]] to test two things: South Vietnamese combat strength and political will and whether the US would respond militarily. With no US military assistance forthcoming the ARVN were unable to hold and the PAVN successfully captured many of the districts around the provincial capital of Phuoc Long weakening ARVN resistance in stronghold areas. President Thieu later abandoned Phuoc Long in early January 1975. As a result, Phuoc Long was the first provincial capital to fall to the PAVN.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://worldhistoryproject.org/1974/12/13/battle-of-phuoc-long-begins|title=Battle of Phuoc Long Begins|website=World History Project|language=en|access-date=2019-04-09}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975, the PAVN launched an [[Battle of Ban Me Thuot|offensive at Ban Me Thuot]] in the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]], in the first phase of what became known as the [[Ho Chi Minh Campaign]]. The South Vietnamese unsuccessfully attempted a defence and counterattack but had few reserve forces, as well as a shortage of spare parts and ammunition. As a consequence, Thi\u1ec7u ordered a withdrawal of key army units from the Central Highlands, which exacerbated an already perilous military situation and undermined the confidence of the ARVN soldiers in their leadership. The retreat became a rout exacerbated by poor planning and conflicting orders from Thi\u1ec7u. PAVN forces also attacked south and from sanctuaries in Laos and Cambodia [[Hue\u2013Da Nang Campaign|capturing Hu\u1ebf and Da Nang]] and advanced southwards. As the military situation deteriorated, ARVN troops started deserting. By early April, South Vietnam had lost almost 3/5th of the country.\n\nThi\u1ec7u requested aid from US President [[Gerald Ford]], but the US Senate would not release extra money to provide aid to South Vietnam, and had already passed laws to prevent further involvement in Vietnam. In desperation, Thi\u1ec7u recalled K\u1ef3 from retirement as a military commander, but resisted calls to name his old rival prime minister.\n\n===Fall of Saigon: April 1975===\n{{main|Fall of Saigon|Operation Frequent Wind}}\n\nMorale was low in South Vietnam as the PAVN advanced. A last-ditch defense was made by the ARVN [[18th Division (South Vietnam)|18th Division]] at the [[Battle of Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c]] from 9\u201321 April. Thi\u1ec7u resigned on 21 April 1975, and fled to [[Taiwan]]. He nominated his Vice President [[Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n H\u01b0\u01a1ng]] as his successor. After only one week in office, the South Vietnamese national assembly voted to hand over the presidency to General D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh. Minh was seen as a more conciliatory figure toward the North, and it was hoped he might be able to negotiate a more favourable settlement to end the war. The North, however, was not interested in negotiations, and its forces [[Fall of Saigon|captured Saigon]]. Minh [[Unconditional surrender|unconditionally surrendered]] Saigon and the rest of South Vietnam to North Vietnam on 30 April 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1975/Fall-of-Saigon/12305821478075-2/|title=Fall of Saigon - 1975 Year in Review - Audio - UPI.com|website=UPI}}</ref>\n\nDuring the hours leading up to the surrender, the United States undertook a massive [[Operation Frequent Wind|evacuation]] of US government personnel as well as high-ranking members of the ARVN and other South Vietnamese who were seen as potential targets for persecution by the Communists. Many of the evacuees were taken directly by helicopter to multiple [[aircraft carrier]]s waiting off the coast. An iconic image of the evacuation is the widely seen footage of empty [[UH-1 Iroquois|Huey]] helicopters being jettisoned over the side of the carriers, to provide more room on the ship's deck for more evacuees to land.\n\n=== Provisional Revolutionary Government ===\n{{main|Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam}}\nFollowing the surrender of Saigon to North Vietnamese forces on 30 April 1975, the [[Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam]] officially became the government of South Vietnam. Subsequently, the provisional government and the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] would merge into the current government of [[Vietnam]] in 2 July 1976.\n\n== Government ==<!--This section is linked from [[Senate]]-->\n{{see|1955 State of Vietnam referendum|1959 South Vietnamese parliamentary election|1960 South Vietnamese coup attempt|1962 South Vietnamese Independence Palace bombing|Buddhist crisis|Hu\u1ebf Vesak shootings|X\u00e1 L\u1ee3i Pagoda raids|1963 South Vietnamese coup|Arrest and assassination of Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m|1964 South Vietnamese coup}}\n\nSouth Vietnam went through many political changes during its short life. Initially, former Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i served as [[Head of State]]. He was unpopular however, largely because monarchical leaders were considered collaborators during French rule and because he had spent his reign absent in France.\n\nIn 1955, Prime Minister Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m held a [[1955 State of Vietnam referendum|referendum]] to decide whether the State of Vietnam would remain a [[monarchy]] or become a republic. This referendum was blatantly rigged in favor of a republic. Not only did an implausible 98% vote in favor of deposing B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i, but over 380,000 more votes were cast than the total number of registered voters; in [[Saigon]], for instance, Di\u1ec7m was credited with 133% of the vote. Di\u1ec7m proclaimed himself the president of the newly formed Republic of Vietnam. Despite successes in politics, economics and social change in the first 5 years, Di\u1ec7m quickly became a dictatorial leader. With the support of the United States government and the [[CIA]], ARVN officers led by General D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh staged a coup and killed him in 1963. The military held a brief interim military government until General [[Nguy\u1ec5n Kh\u00e1nh]] [[1964 South Vietnamese coup|deposed Minh]] in a January 1964 coup. Until late 1965, multiple coups and changes of government occurred, with some civilians being allowed to give a semblance of civil rule overseen by a military junta.\n\nIn 1965, the feuding civilian government voluntarily resigned and handed power back to the nation's military, in the hope this would bring stability and unity to the nation. An elected constituent assembly including representatives of all the branches of the military decided to switch the nation's system of government to a Semi-Presidential system. Military rule initially failed to provide much stability however, as internal conflicts and political inexperience caused various factions of the army to launch coups and counter-coups against one another, making leadership very tumultuous. The situation within the ranks of the military stabilised in mid-1965 when the [[Republic of Vietnam Air Force]] chief Nguy\u1ec5n Cao K\u1ef3 became Prime Minister, with General Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u as the figurehead chief of state. As Prime Minister, K\u1ef3 consolidated control of the South Vietnamese government and ruled the country with an iron fist.<ref name=Farber>{{cite book|title=The Sixties Chronicle|author=David Farber|publisher=Legacy Publishing|year=2004|isbn=978-1412710091}}</ref>{{rp|273}}\n\nIn June 1965, K\u1ef3's influence over the ruling military government was solidified when he forced civilian prime minister [[Phan Huy Qu\u00e1t]] from power.<ref name=Farber/>{{rp|232}} Often praising aspects of Western culture in public,<ref name=Farber/>{{rp|264}} Ky was supported by the United States and its allied nations,<ref name=Farber/>{{rp|264}} though doubts began to circulate among Western officials by 1966 on whether or not Ky could maintain stability in South Vietnam.<ref name=Farber/>{{rp|264}} A repressive leader, Ky was greatly despised by his fellow countrymen.<ref name=Farber/>{{rp|273}} In early 1966, protesters influenced by popular [[Buddhist monk]] [[Th\u00edch Tr\u00ed Quang]] attempted an [[Buddhist Uprising|uprising]] in Quang's hometown of Da Nang.<ref name=Farber/>{{rp|273}} The uprising was unsuccessful and Ky's repressive stance towards the nation's Buddhist population continued.<ref name=Farber/>{{rp|273}}\n\nIn 1967, the [[unicameral]] [[1956 South Vietnamese Constitutional Assembly election|National Assembly]] was replaced by a [[bicameral]] system consisting of a [[1967 South Vietnamese parliamentary election|Parliament]] or Lower House (''Ha Nghi Vi\u1ec7n'') and a [[1967 South Vietnamese Senate election|Senate]] or Upper House (''Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng Nghi Vi\u1ec7n'') and South Vietnam held its first elections under the new system. The military nominated Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u as their candidate, and he was [[1967 South Vietnamese presidential election|elected]] with a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the popular vote. Thieu quickly consolidated power much to the dismay of those who hoped for an era of more political openness. He was [[1971 South Vietnamese presidential election|re-elected]] unopposed in 1971, receiving a suspiciously high 94% of the vote on an 87% turn-out. Thieu ruled until the final days of the war, resigning on 21 April 1975. Vice-President Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n H\u01b0\u01a1ng assumed power for a week, but on 27 April the Parliament and Senate voted to transfer power to D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh who was the nation's last president and who unconditionally surrendered to the Communist forces on 30 April 1975.\n\nThe National Assembly/Parliament was located in the Saigon Opera House, now the [[Municipal Theatre, Ho Chi Minh City]],<ref name=Doling>{{cite book|last=Doling|first=Tim|title=Exploring Saigon-Cholon \u2013 Vanishing Heritage of Ho Cho Minh City|publisher=Th\u1ebf Gi\u1edbi Publishers|year=2019|isbn=9786047761388}}</ref>{{rp|100}} while the Senate was located at 45-47 B\u1ebfn Ch\u01b0\u01a1ng Street (''B\u1ebfn Ch\u01b0\u01a1ng D\u01b0\u01a1ng''), District 1, originally the Chamber of Commerce, and now the [[Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange]].<ref name=Doling/>{{rp|218}}\n\nThe South Vietnamese government was regularly accused of holding large quantity of political prisoners, of which the exact number was a source of contention.

In 1991, it became part of the independent nation of Ukraine.\n\nAdministratively, Lviv serves as the administrative centre of [[Lviv Oblast]] and has the status of [[city of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]].\n\nLviv was the centre of the historical regions of [[Red Ruthenia]] and [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]. The historical heart of the city, with its old buildings and cobblestone streets, survived Soviet and German occupations during World War II largely unscathed. The city has many industries and institutions of [[higher education]] such as [[Lviv University]] and [[Lviv Polytechnic]]. Lviv is also the home of many cultural institutions, including a philharmonic orchestra and the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]].

First Catholic Archbishop who resided in Lviv was Jan Rzeszowski.\n\nIn 1434, the Ruthenian domain of the Crown was transformed into the [[Ruthenian Voivodeship]]. In 1444, the city was granted the [[staple right]], which resulted in its growing prosperity and wealth, as it became one of major trading centres on the merchant routes between [[Central Europe]] and [[Black Sea]] region. It was also transformed into one of the main fortresses of the kingdom, and was a royal city, like [[Krak\u00f3w]] or [[Gda\u0144sk]]. During the 17th century, Lw\u00f3w was the second largest city of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], with the population of about 30,000.\n\nIn 1572, one of the first publishers of books in what is now Ukraine, [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fedorov]], a graduate of the [[Jagiellonian University|University of Krak\u00f3w]], settled here for a brief period. The city became a significant centre for [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] with the establishment of an Orthodox brotherhood, a Greek-Slavonic school and a printer which published the first full versions of the Bible in Church Slavonic in 1580. A [[List of Jesuit educational institutions in the Philippines|Jesuit Collegium]] was founded in 1608, and on 20 January 1661 King [[John II Casimir]] of Poland issued a decree granting it \"the honour of the academy and the title of the university\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manresa-sj.org/stamps/2_Ukraine.htm|title=Jesuits in Ukraine|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe 17th century brought invading armies of [[Swedish Empire|Swedes]], [[Hungary|Hungarians]],<ref>Cathal J.

In 1648 an army of [[Zaporozhian Cossacks|Cossacks]] and Crimean Tatars besieged the town. They captured the [[Lviv High Castle|High Castle]], murdering its defenders, but the city itself was not sacked due to the fact that the leader of the revolution [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] accepted a ransom of 250,000 ducats, and the Cossacks marched north-west towards [[Zamo\u015b\u0107]]. It was one of two major cities in Poland which was not captured during the so-called [[Deluge (history)|''Deluge'']]: the other one was [[Gda\u0144sk]] (Danzig). At that time, Lw\u00f3w witnessed a historic scene, as here King John II Casimir made his famous [[Lw\u00f3w Oath]]. On 1 April 1656, during a holy mass in Lw\u00f3w's Cathedral, conducted by the [[papal legate]] [[Pietro Vidoni]], John Casimir in a grandiose and elaborate ceremony entrusted the Commonwealth under the Blessed Virgin Mary's protection, whom he announced as ''The Queen of the Polish Crown and other of his countries''. He also swore to ''protect the Kingdom's folk from any impositions and unjust bondage''.\n\nTwo years later, John Casimir, in honour of bravery of its residents, declared Lw\u00f3w to be equal to two historic capitals of the Commonwealth, Krak\u00f3w and [[Wilno]]. In the same year, 1658, [[Pope Alexander VII]] declared the city to be [[Semper fidelis]], in recognition of its key role in defending Europe and Roman-Catholicism from Muslim invasion.\n\nIn 1672 it was surrounded by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] who also failed to conquer it. Three years later, the [[Battle of Lw\u00f3w (1675)]] took place near the city. Lw\u00f3w was captured for the first time since the [[Middle Ages]] by a foreign army in 1704 when Swedish troops under King [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] entered the city after a short siege. The [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|plague]] of the early 18th century caused the death of about 10,000 inhabitants (40% of the city's population).<ref>Karl-Erik Frandsen.

In 1784, a [[latin language]] university was opened with lectures in German, Polish and even Ruthenian; after closing again in 1805, it was reopened in 1817. By 1825 German became the sole language of instruction.<ref name=\"multi\" />\n[[File:Lwow Panorama Raclawicka.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Rac\u0142awice Panorama]] opened in 1894]]\n\nDuring the 19th century, the Austrian administration attempted to [[Germanisation|Germanise]] the city's educational and governmental institutions. Many cultural organisations which did not have a pro-German orientation were closed. After the [[revolutions of 1848]], the language of instruction at the university shifted from German to include Ukrainian and Polish. Around that time, a certain [[sociolect]] developed in the city known as the [[Lw\u00f3w dialect]]. Considered to be a type of Polish dialect, it draws its roots from numerous other languages besides Polish. In 1853, street lighting was introduced [[Ignacy \u0141ukasiewicz]] and Jan Zeh. In that year [[kerosene]] lamps were introduced as street lights. Then in 1858, these were updated to gas lamps, and in 1900 to electric ones.\n\nAfter the so-called \"[[Ausgleich]]\" of February 1867, the [[Austrian Empire]] was reformed into a dualist [[Austria-Hungary]] and a slow yet steady process of liberalisation of Austrian rule in Galicia started. From 1873, Galicia was de facto an autonomous province of [[Austria-Hungary]] with Polish and [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]], as official languages. Germanisation was halted and the censorship lifted as well. [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] was subject to the Austrian part of the Dual Monarchy, but the [[Diet of Galicia|Galician Sejm]] and provincial administration, both established in Lviv, had extensive privileges and prerogatives, especially in education, culture, and local affairs. The city started to grow rapidly, becoming the fourth largest in Austria-Hungary, according to the census of 1910. Many [[Belle \u00c9poque]] public edifices and tenement houses were erected, with many the buildings from the Austrian period, such as the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]], built in the [[Vienna|Viennese]] neo-Renaissance style.\n[[File:Sejm Galicyjski.jpg|thumb|[[Diet of Galicia|The Galician Sejm]] (till 1918), since 1920 the [[Jan Kazimierz University]]]]\n\nDuring Habsburg rule, Lviv became one of the most important Polish, Ukrainian and Jewish cultural centres. In Lviv, according to the Austrian census of 1910, which listed religion and language, 51% of the city's population were [[Roman Catholics]], 28% Jews, and 19% belonged to the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. Linguistically, 86% of the city's population used the [[Polish language]] and 11% preferred the [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]].<ref name=\"New International\" /> At that time, Lviv was home to a number of renowned Polish-language institutions, such as the [[Ossolineum]], with the second largest collection of Polish books in the world, the Polish Academy of Arts, the National Museum (since 1908), the Historical Museum of the City of Lw\u00f3w (since 1891), the [[Polish Copernicus Society of Naturalists]], the [[Polish Historical Society]], [[Lviv University|Lw\u00f3w University]], with Polish as the official language since 1882, the [[Lw\u00f3w Scientific Society]], the [[Lviv National Art Gallery|Lw\u00f3w Art Gallery]], the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet|Polish Theatre]], and the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv|Polish Archdiocese]].\n\nFurthermore, Lviv was the centre of a number of Polish independence organisations. In June 1908, [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]], [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]] and [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]] founded here the [[Union of Active Struggle]]. Two years later, the paramilitary organisation, called the [[Riflemen's Association]], was also founded in the city by Polish activists.\n\nAt the same time, Lviv became the city where famous Ukrainian writers (such as [[Ivan Franko]], [[Panteleimon Kulish]] and [[Ivan Nechuy-Levytsky]]) published their work. It was a centre of Ukrainian cultural revival. The city also housed the largest and most influential Ukrainian institutions in the world, including the [[Prosvita]] society dedicated to spreading literacy in the Ukrainian language, the [[Shevchenko Scientific Society]], the Dniester Insurance Company and base of the [[Ukrainian cooperative movement]], and it served as the seat of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholic Church]]. Lviv was also a major centre of Jewish culture, in particular as a centre of the [[Yiddish language]], and was the home of the world's first Yiddish-language daily newspaper, the ''Lemberger Togblat'', established in 1904.<ref>Paul Robert Magocsi.

Following Warsaw, Lw\u00f3w was the second most important cultural and academic centre of interwar Poland. For example, in 1920 professor [[Rudolf Weigl]] of the Lw\u00f3w University developed a vaccine against [[typhus fever]]. Furthermore, the geographic location of Lw\u00f3w gave it an important role in stimulating international trade and fostering the city's and Poland's economic development. A major [[trade fair]] called ''[[Targi Wschodnie]]'' was established in 1921. In the academic year 1937\u20131938, there were 9,100 students attending five institutions of higher education, including the [[Lviv University|Lw\u00f3w University]] as well as the [[Lviv Polytechnic|Polytechnic]].<ref>''Ma\u0142y Rocznik Statystyczny 1939'' (Polish statistical yearbook of 1939), [[Central Statistical Office (Poland)]], Warsaw, 1939.</ref>\n\nWhile about two-thirds of the city's inhabitants were Poles, some of whom speak the characteristic [[Lw\u00f3w dialect]], the eastern part of the Lw\u00f3w Voivodeship had a relative [[Demographics of Ukraine|Ukrainian]] majority in most of its rural areas.

Soon thereafter, the local commanders of Polish ''[[Armia Krajowa]]'' were invited to a meeting with the commanders of the Red Army. During the meeting, they were arrested, as it turned out to be a trap set by the Soviet NKVD. Later, in the winter and spring of 1945, the local NKVD kept arresting and harassing Poles in Lviv (which according to Soviet sources on 1 October 1944 still had a clear Polish majority of 66.7%) in an attempt to encourage their emigration from the city. Those arrested were released only after they had signed papers in which they agreed to emigrate to Poland, which postwar borders were [[Territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II|to be shifted westwards]] in accordance with the [[Yalta conference]] settlements. In Yalta, despite Polish objections, the Allied leaders, Joseph Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill decided that Lviv should remain within the borders of the Soviet Union. On 16 August 1945, a border agreement<ref>[[:pl:wikisource:Umowa graniczna pomi\u0119dzy Polsk\u0105 a ZSRR z 16 sierpnia 1945 roku]] [http://pl.wikisource.org/wiki/Umowa_graniczna_pomi%C4%99dzy_Polsk%C4%85_a_ZSRR_z_16_sierpnia_1945_roku] full text of the agreement {{in lang|pl}}</ref> was signed in Moscow between the [[government of the Soviet Union]] and the [[Provisional Government of National Unity]] installed by the Soviets in Poland. In the treaty, Polish authorities formally [[cession|ceded]] the prewar eastern part of the country to the Soviet Union, agreeing to the Polish-Soviet border to be drawn according to the [[Curzon Line]]. Consequently, the agreement was [[ratification|ratified]] on 5 February 1946.\n\n=== Post-war Soviet Union ===\n[[File:\u0421\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0427\u041a2.jpg|thumb|right|Sykhiv \u2013 Lviv's largest residential neighborhood, was built in the early 1980s under Soviet rule]]\n\nIn February 1946, Lviv became a part of the Soviet Union. It is estimated that from 100,000 to 140,000 Poles were resettled from the city into the so-called [[Recovered Territories]] as a part of [[Population transfer#Central Europe|postwar population transfers]], many of them to the area of newly acquired [[Wroc\u0142aw]], formerly the German city of Breslau. Many buildings in the old part of the city are examples of Polish architecture, which flourished in Lviv after the opening of the Technical School (later Polytechnic), the first higher-education technical academy on Polish lands. Polytechnic educated generations of architects which were influential in the entire country. Examples are: the main buildings of [[Lviv Polytechnic]], [[University of Lviv]], [[Lviv Opera]], [[Lviv railway station]], former building of Galicyjska Kasa Oszcz\u0119dno\u015bci, [[Potocki Palace, Lviv|Potocki Palace]].<ref>Ihor Zhuk, 'The Architecture of Lviv from the Thirteenth to the Twentieth Centuries', s. 113</ref> During the interwar period, Lviv was striving to become a modern metropolis, so architects experimented with modernism.

The prevalence of the Ukrainian-speaking population has led to the fact that under the conditions of Soviet Russification,{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Lviv became a major centre of the [[Dissident movement in the Soviet Union|dissident movement in Ukraine]] and played a key role in Ukraine's independence in 1991.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, the city expanded both in population and size mostly due to the city's rapidly growing industrial base. Due to the fight of [[SMERSH]] with the guerrilla formations of the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] the city obtained a nickname with a negative connotation of ''Banderstadt'' as the City of [[Stepan Bandera]]. The German suffix for city ''stadt'' was added instead of the Russian ''grad'' to imply alienation. Over the years the residents of the city found this so ridiculous that even people not familiar with Bandera accepted it as a sarcasm in reference to the Soviet perception of western Ukraine. In the period of [[Perestroika|liberalisation from the Soviet system]] in the 1980s, the city became the centre of political movements advocating Ukrainian independence from the USSR. By the time of the fall of the Soviet Union the name became a proud mark for the Lviv natives culminating in the creation of a local rock band under the name ''Khloptsi z Bandershtadtu'' (Boys from Banderstadt).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bandershtadt.w6.ru/ |title=Official site of the Khloptsi z Bandershtadtu |publisher=Bandershtadt.w6.ru |accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Independent Ukraine ===\nCitizens of Lviv strongly supported [[Viktor Yushchenko]] during the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election]] and played a key role in the [[Orange Revolution]].

After Casimir III conquered Lviv in 1349 the Jewish citizens received many privileges equal to that of other citizens of Poland. Lviv had two separate [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Jewish quarters]], one within the city walls and one outside on the outskirts of the city. Each had its separate [[synagogue]], although they shared a cemetery, which was also used by the [[Crimean Karaite]] community. Before 1939 there were 97 synagogues.\n\nBefore the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] about one-third of the city's population was made up of Jews (more than 140,000 on the eve of World War II). This number swelled to about 240,000 by the end of 1940 as tens of thousands of Jews fled from the Nazi-occupied parts of Poland into the relative (and temporary) sanctuary of Soviet-occupied Poland (including Lviv) following the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact that divided Poland into Nazi and Soviet zones in 1939. Almost all these Jews were killed in the Holocaust. Meanwhile, the Nazis also destroyed the Jewish cemetery, which was subsequently \"paved over by the Soviets\".<ref name=\"erasedvanishingtraces\"/>\n\nAfter the war, a new Jewish population was formed from among the hundreds of thousands of Russians and Ukrainians that migrated to the city. The post-war Jewish population peaked at 30,000 in the 1970s. Currently, the Jewish population has shrunk considerably as a result of [[emigration]] (mainly to Israel and the United States) and, to a lesser degree, [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation]], and is estimated at 1,100. A number of organisations continue to be active.\n\nThe [[Sholem Aleichem]] Jewish Culture Society in Lviv initiated the construction of a monument to the victims of the [[ghetto]] in 1988.

The city is known as a centre of art, literature, music and theatre. Nowadays, the indisputable evidence of the city cultural richness is a big number of theatres, concert halls, creative unions, and also the high number of many artistic activities (more than 100 festivals annually, 60 museums, 10 theatres).\n\n[[Old Town (Lviv)|Lviv's historic centre]] has been on the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage list]] since 1998.

In recent centuries Lviv was spared some of the invasions and wars that destroyed other [[List of cities in Ukraine|Ukrainian cities]]. Its architecture reflects various European styles and periods. \nAfter the fires of 1527 and 1556 Lviv lost most of its [[gothic architecture|gothic]]-style buildings but it retains many buildings in [[renaissance architecture|renaissance]], [[baroque architecture|baroque]] and the [[classical architecture|classic]] styles. There are works by artists of the [[Vienna Secession]], [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]].\n\nThe buildings have many stone sculptures and carvings, particularly on large doors, which are hundreds of years old. The remains of old churches dot the central cityscape. Some three- to five-storey buildings have hidden inner courtyards and grottoes in various states of repair. Some cemeteries are of interest: for example, the [[Lychakiv Cemetery|Lychakivskiy Cemetery]] where the Polish elite was buried for centuries. Leaving the central area the [[architectural style]] changes radically as Soviet-era [[high-rise]] blocks dominate. In the centre of the city, the [[History of the Soviet Union|Soviet era]] is reflected mainly in a few modern-style national monuments and sculptures.\n\nFile:ProspektSvobodyLviv.jpg|Early 20th century architecture in Lviv\n\n=== Monuments ===\n[[File:Lviv - Church of Transfiguration 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Inside the [[Church of Transfiguration, Lviv|Church of the Transfiguration]]]]\n[[File:\u0423\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0446\u0435\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044c \u0432 \u041b\u044c\u0432\u043e\u0432.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Dormition Church, Lviv|Church of the Assumption]]]]\n[[File:Chapel-of-Boim-family.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Chapel of the Boim family]]]]\n\nOutdoor sculptures in the city commemorate many notable individuals and topics reflecting the rich and complex [[history of Lviv]]. There are monuments to [[Adam Mickiewicz]], [[Ivan Franko]], [[Daniel of Galicia|King Danylo]], [[Taras Shevchenko]], [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fedorov]], [[Solomiya Krushelnytska]], [[Ioan Potcoav\u0103|Ivan Pidkova]], [[Mykhailo Hrushevskyi]], [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Jan Kili\u0144ski]], [[Ivan Trush]], [[Saint George]], [[Wojciech Bartosz G\u0142owacki|Bartosz G\u0142owacki]], the monument to the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], to [[Nikifor]], [[The Good Soldier \u0160vejk]], [[Stepan Bandera]], [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]], and many others.\n\nDuring the [[interwar period]] there were monuments commemorating important figures of the history of Poland. Some of them were moved to the Polish \"[[Recovered Territories]]\" after World War II, like the monument to [[Aleksander Fredro]] which now is in [[Wroc\u0142aw]], the monument of King [[John III Sobieski]] which after 1945 was moved to [[Gda\u0144sk]], and the monument of [[Kornel Ujejski]] which is now in [[Szczecin]]. A book market takes place around the monument to [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan F\u0435dorovych]], a typographer in the 16th century who fled Moscow and found a new home in Lviv.\n\nNew ideas came to Lviv during the Austro\u2013Hungarian rule. In the 19th century, many [[publishing]] houses, newspapers and magazines were established. Among these was the [[Ossolineum]] which was one of the most important Polish scientific libraries. Most Polish-language books and publications of the Ossolineum library are still kept in a local Jesuit church. In 1997 the Polish government asked the [[Government of Ukraine|Ukrainian government]] to return these documents to Poland. Subsequently, in 2003 Ukraine allowed access to these publications for the first time. In 2006 an office of the Ossolineum (which now is located in [[Wroc\u0142aw]]) was opened in Lviv and began a process to scan all its documents. Works written in Lviv contributed to Austrian, [[Ukrainian literature|Ukrainian]], Yiddish, and [[Polish literature]], with a multitude of translations.\n\n=== Religion ===\nLviv is a city of religious variety. [[Religion]] (2012): Catholic: 57% ([[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] 56% and [[Roman Catholic Church]] 1%) [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]]: 32%, [[Protestantism]]: 2% [[Judaism]] : 0.1% Other religion: 3% Indifferent to religious matters: 4% [[Atheism]]: 1.9%<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140429045226/http://city-institute.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=231:who-is-he-the-citizen-of-lviv&catid=1:latest Who is he, the citizen of Lviv?| Lviv City Institute].</ref>\n\n==== Christianity ====\nAt one point, over 60 churches existed in the city. The largest [[Christian Church]]es have existed in the city since the 13th century. The city has been the seat of the Catholic Church in 3 rites: The [[Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Lviv]], the [[Roman Catholics]], and the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Church]]. Each has had a diocesan seat in Lviv since the 16th century. At the end of the 16th century, the Orthodox community in Ukraine [[Union of Brest|transferred their allegiance]] to the [[Pope]] in Rome and became the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. This bond was forcibly dissolved in 1946 by the Soviet authorities and the Roman Catholic community was forced out by the expulsion of the Polish population. Since 1989, religious life in Lviv has experienced a revival.\n\nLviv is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv]], the centre of the [[Roman Catholicism in Ukraine|Roman Catholic Church in Ukraine]] and until 21 August 2005 was the centre of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. About 35 percent of religious buildings belong to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, 11.5 percent to the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]], 9 per cent to the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate|Ukrainian Orthodox Church \u2013 Kiev Patriarchate]] and 6 per cent to the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]].\n\nUntil 2005, Lviv was the only city with two Catholic [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinals]]: [[Lubomyr Husar]] ([[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Byzantine Rite]]) and [[Marian Jaworski]] ([[Catholic Church|Latin Rite]]).\n\nIn June 2001, [[Pope John Paul II]] visited the [[Latin Cathedral, Lviv|Latin Cathedral]], [[St. George's Cathedral, Lviv|St. George's Cathedral]] and the [[Armenian Cathedral, Lviv|Armenian Cathedral]].\n\n==== Judaism ====\nLviv historically had a large and active Jewish community and until 1941 at least 45 [[synagogue]]s and prayer houses existed. Even in the 16th century, two separate communities existed. One lived in today's old town with the other in the [[Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie]]. The [[Golden Rose Synagogue (Lviv)|Golden Rose Synagogue]] was built in Lviv in 1582. In the 19th century, a more differentiated community started to spread out. Liberal Jews sought more [[cultural assimilation]] and spoke German and Polish. On the other hand, [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jews]] tried to retain the old traditions. Between 1941 and 1944, the Germans in effect completely destroyed the centuries-old Jewish tradition of Lviv. Most synagogues were destroyed and the Jewish population forced first into a ghetto before being forcibly transported to concentration camps where they were murdered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.holocaust.kiev.ua/eng/seminarse/lviv.htm#vip2|title=International Forum:\"Challenge of Holocaust and Its Lessons\"|work=Lviv Polytechnic National University Regional Holocaust Study Center: Ukrainian Holocaust History Study Center|date=November 2003|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308035832/http://www.holocaust.kiev.ua/eng/seminarse/lviv.htm |archive-date=8 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nUnder the Soviet Union, synagogues remained closed and were used as warehouses or cinemas. Only since the fall of the [[Iron Curtain]], has the remainder of the Jewish community experienced a faint revival.\n\nCurrently, the only functioning Orthodox Jewish synagogue in Lviv is the [[Beis Aharon V'Yisrael Synagogue]].\n\n=== Arts ===\n[[File:Lwowska Galeria Sztuki - Wn\u0119trza 01.JPG|thumb|left|A room in the <br /> [[Lviv National Art Gallery]]]]\n\nThe range of artistic Lviv is impressive. On the one hand, it is the city of classical art. Lviv Opera and Lviv Philharmonic are places that can satisfy the demands of true appraisers of the classical arts. This is the city of one of the most distinguished sculptors in Europe, [[Johann Georg Pinsel|Johann Georg Pinzel]], whose works can be seen on the fa\u00e7ade of the [[St. George's Cathedral, Lviv|St. George's Cathedral]] in Lviv and in the Pinzel Museum. This is also the city of [[Solomiya Krushelnytska]], who began her career as a singer of Lviv Opera and later became the prima donna of La Scala Opera in Milan.\n\nThe \"Group Artes\" was a young movement founded in 1929. Many of the artists studied in Paris and travelled throughout Europe. They worked and experimented in different areas of modern art: [[Futurism]], [[Cubism]], [[New Objectivity]] and [[Surrealism]]. Co\u2013operation took place between avant-garde musicians and authors. Altogether thirteen exhibitions by \"''Artes''\" took place in Warsaw, Krak\u00f3w, \u0141\u00f3dz and Lviv. The German occupation put an end to this group. Otto Hahn was executed in 1942 in Lviv and Aleksander Riemer was murdered in Auschwitz in 1943.<ref>Kosmolinska, Natalia (2007). \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=KFbmtdibpIMC&pg=PA224 Ein Fenster zur Moderne: Das Atelier der Sielskis].\" In: Hermann Simon, Irene Stratenwerth, & Ronald Hinrichs (Eds.), ''Lemberg: Eine Reise nach Europa'' Berlin: Christoph Links Verlag. pp. 218\u2013227; here: p. 224.</ref> Henryk Streng and Margit Reich-Sielska were able to escape the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] (or Shoah). Most of the surviving members of Artes lived in Poland after 1945. Only Margit Reich-Sielska (1900\u20131980) and Roman Sielski (1903\u20131990) stayed in Soviet Lviv. For years the city was one of the most important cultural centres of Poland with such writers as [[Aleksander Fredro]], [[Gabriela Zapolska]], [[Leopold Staff]], [[Maria Konopnicka]] and [[Jan Kasprowicz]] living in Lviv.\n\nToday Lviv is a city of fresh ideas and unusual characters. There are about 20 galleries (The \"Dzyga\" Gallery, \u0410rt-Gallery \"Primus\", Gallery of the History of Ukrainian Military Uniforms, Gallery of Modern Art \"Zelena Kanapa\" and others). [[Lviv National Art Gallery]] is the largest museum of arts in Ukraine, with approximately 50,000 artworks, including paintings, sculptures and works of graphic art of Western and Eastern Europe, from the Middle Ages to modern days.\n\n=== Theatre and opera ===\n[[File:\u041b\u044c\u0432\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u041e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430.JPG|thumb|The [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet|Lviv Opera and Ballet Theatre]], an important cultural centre for residents and visitors]]\n\nIn 1842 the [[Skarbek Theatre]] was opened making it the third largest theatre in [[Central Europe]]. In 1903 the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet|Lviv National Opera]] house, which at that time was called the City-Theatre, was opened emulating the [[Vienna State Opera]] house. The house initially offered a changing repertoire such as classical dramas in German and [[Polish language]], opera, operetta, comedy and theatre.\nThe opera house is named after the Ukrainian opera diva [[Solomiya Krushelnytska|Salomea Krushelnytska]] who worked here.\n\nIn the [[Janowska concentration camp]], the Nazis conducted torture and executions to music. To do so they brought almost the whole Lviv National Opera to the camp. Professor Shtriks, opera conductor Mund and other famous Jewish musicians were among the members. From 1941 to 1944 the Nazis massacred 200,000 people including all 40 musicians.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Tango-Death-Story-Holocaust-Survivors/dp/B085HHMGMT/|title=Tango of Death.

The Theatre is a well-organized creative body where over 500 people work towards a common goal. The repertoire includes 10 Ukrainian music compositions. No other similar theatre in Ukraine has such a large number of [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] productions. There are also many operas written by foreign composers, and most of these operas are performed in the original language: ''Othello'', ''Aida'', ''La Traviata'', ''Nabucco'', and ''A Masked Ball'' by G. Verdi, ''Tosca'', ''La Boh\u00e8me'' and ''Madame Butterfly'' by G. Puccini, ''Cavalleria Rusticana'' by P. Mascagni, and ''Pagliacci'' by R. Leoncavallo (in Italian); ''Carmen'' by G. Bizet (in French), ''The Haunted Manor'' by S. Moniuszko (in Polish)\n\n=== Museums and art galleries ===\nMuseum Pharmacy \"Pid Chornym Orlom\" (Beneath the Black Eagle) was founded in 1735; it is the oldest pharmacy in Lviv. A museum related to pharmaceutical history was opened on the premises of the old pharmacy in 1966. The idea of creating such a museum had already come up in the 19th century. The Galician Association of Pharmacists was created in 1868; members managed to assemble a small collection of exhibits, thus making the first step towards creating a new museum. Nowadays, the exhibition has expanded considerably, with 16 exhibit rooms and a general exhibition surface totalling 700 sq. m. There are more than 3,000 exhibits in the museum. This is the only operating Museum Pharmacy in Ukraine and Europe.\n[[File:\u041f\u0440\u043e\u043c\u044b\u0448\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0439.jpg|thumb|left|The main building of [[Lviv National Museum]]]]\n\nThe most notable of the museums are [[Lviv National Museum]] which houses the National Gallery. Its collection includes more than 140,000 unique items. The museum takes special pride in presenting the largest and most complete collection of medieval sacral art of the 12th to 18th centuries: icons, manuscripts, rare ancient books, decoratively carved pieces of art, metal and plastic artworks, and fabrics embroidered with gold and silver. The museum also boasts a unique monument of [[Ukrainian Baroque]] style: the Bohorodchansky Iconostasis. Exhibits include: Ancient Ukrainian art from the 12th to 15th centuries; Ukrainian art from the 16th to 18th centuries; and Ukrainian art from the end of the 18th to the beginning of the 20th centuries.\n\n=== Music ===\nLviv has an active musical and cultural life. Apart from the Lviv Opera, it has symphony orchestras, chamber orchestras and the Trembita Chorus. Lviv has one of the most prominent music academies and music colleges in Ukraine, the [[Lviv Conservatory]], and also has a factory for the manufacture of stringed musical instruments. Lviv has been the home of numerous composers such as Mozart's son [[Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart]], [[Stanyslav Lyudkevych|Stanislav Liudkevych]], [[Wojciech Kilar]] and [[Mykola Kolessa]].\n\nFlute virtuoso and composer [[Franz Doppler|Albert Franz Doppler]] (1821\u20131883) was born and spent his formative years here, including flute lessons from his father. The classical pianist [[Mieczys\u0142aw Horszowski]] (1892\u20131993) was born here. The opera diva [[Solomiya Krushelnytska|Salomea Kruszelnicka]] called Lviv her home in the 1920s to 1930s. The classical violinist Adam Han Gorski was born here in 1940. \"''[[Polish Radio Lw\u00f3w]]''\" was a [[Polskie Radio|Polish radio]] station that went on-air on 15 January 1930. The programme proved very popular in Poland. [[Classical music]] and entertainment was aired as well as lectures, readings, youth-programmes, news and liturgical services on Sunday.\n[[File:PikkardiyskaTertsia01.jpg|thumb|[[Pikkardiyska Tertsiya]] \u2013 Ukrainian a cappella musical formation]]\nPopular throughout Poland was the [[Weso\u0142a Lwowska Fala|Comic Lw\u00f3w Wave]] a [[cabaret]]-revue with [[musical composition|musical pieces]]. Jewish artists contributed a great part to this artistic activity. Composers such as [[Henryk Wars]], songwriters [[Emanuel Szlechter]] and [[Wiktor Budzy\u0144ski]], the actor [[Weso\u0142a Lwowska Fala|Mieczys\u0142aw Monderer]] and [[Weso\u0142a Lwowska Fala|Adolf Fleischer]] (\"''Aprikosenkranz und Untenbaum''\") worked in Lviv. The most notable stars of the shows were [[Henryk Vogelf\u00e4nger]] and [[Kazimierz Wajda]] who appeared together as the comic duo \"Szczepko and To\u0144ko\" and were similar to [[Laurel and Hardy]].\n\nThe Lviv Philharmonic is a major cultural centre with its long history and traditions that complement the entire culture of [[Ukraine]]. Exactly from the stage of Lviv Philharmonic began their way to the great art world-famous Ukrainian musicians \u2013 [[Oleh Krysa]], Oleksandr Slobodyanik, Yuriy Lysychenko, Maria Chaikovska, also the musicians of new generation \u2013 E. Chupryk, Y. Ermin, Oksana Rapita, Olexandr Kozarenko. Lviv Philharmonic is one of the leading concert institutions in Ukraine, which activities include various forms of promotion of the best examples of the music art \u2013 international festivals, cycles of concerts-monographs, concerts with participation of young musicians, etc.\n\nThe Chamber Orchestra \"Lviv virtuosos\" was organised of the best Lviv musicians in 1994. The orchestra consists of 16\u201340 persons / it depends on programmes/ and in the repertoire are included the musical compositions from Bach, Corelli to modern Ukrainian and European composers. During the short time of its operation, the orchestra acquired the professional level of the best European standards. It is mentioned in more than 100 positive articles of the Ukrainian and foreign musical critics.\n\nLviv is the hometown of the Vocal formation \"[[Pikkardiyska Tertsiya]]\" and [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004]] winner [[Ruslana]] who has since become well known in Europe and the rest of the world. PikkardiyskaTertsia was created on 24 September 1992 in Lviv, and has won many musical awards. It all began with a quartet performing ancient Ukrainian music from the 15th century, along with adaptations of traditional Ukrainian folk songs.\n\n[[Lviv Organ Hall]] is a place where classical music (organ, symphonic, cameral) and art meet together. 50,000 visitors each year, dozens of musicians from all over the world.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\nLviv is also the hometown to one of the most successful and popular Ukrainian rock bands, [[Okean Elzy]].\n\n=== Universities and academia ===\n[[File:University Lviv 2009 1.JPG|thumb|left|The front [[Facade|fa\u00e7ade]] of the [[Lviv University]], the oldest university in Ukraine]]\n[[Lviv University]] is one of the oldest in Central Europe and was founded as a [[Society of Jesus]] (Jesuit) school in 1608. Its prestige greatly increased through the work of philosopher [[Kazimierz Twardowski]] (1866\u20131938) who was one of the founders of the [[Lw\u00f3w-Warsaw School of Logic]]. This [[school of thought]] set benchmarks for academic research and [[education]] in Poland. The Polish politician of the interbellum period [[Stanis\u0142aw G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski]] had served as dean of the law department (1889\u20131890) and as the University rector (1908\u20131909). In 1901 the city was the seat of the [[Lw\u00f3w Scientific Society]] among whose members were major scientific figures. The most well-known were the mathematicians [[Stefan Banach]], [[Juliusz Schauder]] and [[Stanislaw Ulam|Stanis\u0142aw Ulam]] who were founders of the [[Lw\u00f3w School of Mathematics]] turning Lviv in the 1930s into the \"World Centre of Functional Analysis\" and whose share in Lviv academia was substantial.\n\nIn 1852 in [[Dublany, Podlaskie Voivodeship|Dublany]] ({{convert|8|km|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} from the outskirts of Lviv) the [[Agricultural Academy in Dublany|Agricultural Academy]] was opened and was one of the first Polish agricultural colleges. The Academy was merged with the [[Lviv Polytechnic]] in 1919. Another important college of the interbellum period was the [[Academy of Foreign Trade in Lw\u00f3w]].\n\nIn 1873 in Lviv was founded [[Shevchenko Scientific Society]] from the beginning it attracted the financial and intellectual support of writers and patrons of [[Ukrainian culture|Ukrainian]] background.\n\nIn 1893 due to the change in its statute, the Shevchenko Scientific Society was transformed into a real scholarly multidisciplinary academy of sciences. Under the presidency of the historian, [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], it greatly expanded its activities, contributing to both the humanities and the physical sciences, law and medicine, but most specifically once again it was concentrated onto the Ukrainian studies.\nThe Soviet Union annexed the eastern half of the Second Polish Republic including the city of Lw\u00f3w which capitulated to the Red Army on 22 September 1939. Upon their occupation of Lviv, the Soviets dissolved the Shevchenko society. Many of its members were arrested and either imprisoned or executed.\n\n=== Mathematics ===\nLviv was the home of the [[Scottish Caf\u00e9]], where in the 1930s and the early 1940s, Polish [[mathematician]]s from the [[Lw\u00f3w School of Mathematics]] met and spent their afternoons discussing mathematical problems. [[Stanislaw Ulam|Stanis\u0142aw Ulam]] who was later a participant in the [[Manhattan Project]] and the proposer of the [[Teller\u2013Ulam design|Teller-Ulam design]] of [[Nuclear weapon design|thermonuclear weapons]], [[Stefan Banach]] one of the founders of [[functional analysis]], [[Hugo Steinhaus]], [[Karol Borsuk]], [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]], [[Mark Kac]] and many other notable mathematicians would gather there.<ref name=\"Ulam\">Stanislaw M.

There are over 20 basic recreation park zones, 3 botanical gardens and 16 natural monuments. They offer a splendid chance to escape from city life or simply sit for a while among the trees, at a nice fountain or a lake. Each park has its individual character which reflects through various monuments and their individual history.\n\n* [[Ivan Franko Park]], is the oldest park in the city. Traces of that time may be found in three- hundred-year-old oak and maple trees. Upon the abrogation of the Jesuit order in 1773 the territory became the town property. A well-known gardener Bager arranged the territory in the landscape style, and most of the trees were planted within 1885\u20131890.\n* [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky Culture and Recreation Park]], is one of the best organised and modern green zones containing a concert and dance hall, stadium, the town of attractions, central stage, numerous cafes and restaurants. In the park there is a Ferris wheel.\n* [[Stryiskyi Park]], it is considered one of the most picturesque parks in the city. The park numbers over 200 species of trees and plants. It is well known for a vast collection of rare and valuable trees and bushes. At the main entrance gate, you will find a pond with swans.\n* [[Regional Landscape Park Znesinnya|Znesinnya Park]] is an ideal site for cycling, skiing sports, and hiking.

The park owes its name to the springs with high iron concentration. This beautiful park with ancient beech trees and numerous paths is a favourite place for many locals.\n* [[Lychakivskyi Park]], founded in 1892 and named after the surrounding suburbs. A botanic garden is situated on the park territory, founded in 1911 and occupying the territory of {{convert|18.5|ha|1|abbr=off}}.\n\n=== Sport ===\nLviv was an important centre for sport in Central Europe and is regarded as the birthplace of Polish [[Association football|football]]. Lviv is the Polish birthplace of other sports. In January 1905 the first Polish [[ice hockey|ice-hockey]] match took place there and two years later the first [[ski jumping|ski-jumping]] competition was organised in nearby [[Slavske|S\u0142awsko]]. In the same year, the first Polish basketball games were organised in Lviv's gymnasiums. In autumn 1887 a gymnasium by Lychakiv Street (pol. ''ulica \u0141yczakowska'') held the first Polish [[track and field]] competition with such sports as the [[long jump]] and [[high jump]]. Lviv's athlete W\u0142adys\u0142aw Ponurski represented Austria in the [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Olympic Games]] in [[Stockholm]]. On 9 July 1922 the first official [[rugby union|rugby]] game in Poland took place at the stadium of Pogo\u0144 Lw\u00f3w in which the rugby team of Orze\u0142 Bia\u0142y Lw\u00f3w divided itself into two teams \u2013 \"The Reds\" and \"The Blacks\". The referee of this game was a Frenchman by the name of Robineau.\n\n[[File:EURO 2012 Lvov clock.jpg|thumb|left|Clock in Lviv on Prospekt Svobody (Freedom Ave.), showing time to start of EURO 2012. Opera and Ballet Theatre in background]]\nThe first known official goal in a Polish football match was scored there on 14 July 1894 during the Lw\u00f3w-Krak\u00f3w game. The goal was scored by [[W\u0142odzimierz Chomicki]] who represented the team of Lviv. In 1904 Kazimierz Hemerling from Lviv published the first translation of the rules of football into Polish and another native of Lviv, Stanis\u0142aw Polakiewicz, became the first officially recognised Polish referee in 1911 the year in which the first [[Polish Football Association|Polish Football Federation]] was founded in Lviv. The first Polish professional football club, [[Czarni Lw\u00f3w]] opened here in 1903 and the first stadium, which belonged to Pogo\u0144, in 1913. Another club, [[Pogo\u0144 Lw\u00f3w]], was four times football champion of Poland (1922, 1923, 1925 and 1926). In the late 1920s as many as four teams from the city played in the Polish Football League (Pogo\u0144, Czarni, Hasmonea and Lechia). [[Hasmonea Lw\u00f3w|Hasmonea]] was the first Jewish football club in Poland. Several notable figures of Polish football came from the city including [[Kazimierz G\u00f3rski]], [[Ryszard Koncewicz]], [[Micha\u0142 Matyas]] and [[Wac\u0142aw Kuchar]].\n\nIn the period 1900\u20131911 opened most famous football clubs in Lviv.\nProfessor Ivan Bobersky has based in the Academic grammar school the first [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] sports circle where schoolboys were engaged in track and field, football, boxing, hockey, skiing, tourism and sledge sports in 1906.\nHe has organised the  \"Ukrainian Sports circle\" in 1908.\nMuch its pupils in due course in 1911 have formed a sports society with the loud name \"Ukraine\" \u2013  first Ukrainian football club of Lviv.<ref>[http://www.boberskiy.org.ua/indexe.html \"Ivan Bobersky \u2013 training of the first teachers of physical training is connected to his name.\"].</ref>\n\nLviv now has several major professional [[football team|football clubs]] and some smaller clubs. [[FC Karpaty Lviv]], founded in 1963, plays in the first division of the [[Ukrainian Premier League]]. Sometimes citizens of Lviv assemble on the central street (Freedom Avenue) to watch and cheer during outdoor broadcasts of games.\n\nThere are three major stadiums in Lviv. One of them is the [[Ukraina Stadium]] which is leased to FC Karpaty Lviv until 2018.\n[[Arena Lviv]] is a brand-new football stadium that was an official venue for [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]] Championship games in Lviv.

An electric tram was introduced on 31 May 1894. The last horse-drawn line was transferred to electric traction in 1908. In 1922 the tramways were switched to driving on the right-hand side. After the annexation of the city by the Soviet Union, several lines were closed but most of the infrastructure was preserved. The tracks are [[narrow gauge railway|narrow-gauge]], unusual for the Soviet Union, but explained by the fact that the system was built while the city was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and needed to run in narrow medieval streets in the centre of town. The Lviv tramway system now runs about 220 cars on {{convert|75|km|0|abbr=off}} of track. Many tracks were reconstructed around 2006. The price in February 2019 of a tram/trolleybus ticket was 5 UAH (reduced fare ticket was 2.5 UAH, e.g. for students). The ticket may be purchased from the driver.\n\nAfter World War II the city grew rapidly due to evacuees returning from Russia, and the Soviet Government's vigorous development of [[heavy industry]]. This included the transfer of entire factories from the Urals and others to the newly \"liberated\" territories of the USSR. The city centre tramway lines were replaced with [[trolleybus]]es on 27 November 1952. New lines were opened to the [[Tower block|blocks of flats]] at the city outskirts.

The main [[Lviv Rail Terminal|Lviv Railway Station]], designed by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sad\u0142owski]], was built in 1904 and was considered one of the best in Europe from both the architectural and the technical aspects.\n\nIn the inter-war period, Lviv (known then as Lw\u00f3w) was one of the most important hubs of the [[Polish State Railways]]. The Lw\u00f3w junction consisted of four stations in mid-1939 \u2013 main station ''Lw\u00f3w G\u0142\u00f3wny'' (now {{lang-uk|Lviv Holovnyi}}), Lw\u00f3w Klepar\u00f3w (now ''Lviv Klepariv''), ''Lw\u00f3w \u0141yczak\u00f3w'' (now ''Lviv Lychakiv''), and ''Lw\u00f3w Podzamcze'' (now ''Lviv Pidzamche''). In August 1939 just before World War II, 73 trains departed daily from the Main Station including 56 local and 17 fast trains. Lw\u00f3w was directly connected with all major centres of the Second Polish Republic as well as such cities as Berlin, [[Bucharest]], and [[Budapest]].<ref>Urz\u0119dowy Rozk\u0142ad Jazdy i Lot\u00f3w PKP, Lato 1939 (Polish State Railroads Timetable, Summer 1939)</ref>\n\nCurrently, several trains cross the nearby Polish\u2013Ukrainian border (mostly via [[Przemy\u015bl]] in Poland). There are good connections to Slovakia ([[Ko\u0161ice]]) and Hungary ([[Budapest]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Many routes have overnight trains with sleeping compartments. Lviv railway is often called the main gateway from Ukraine to Europe although buses are often a cheaper and more convenient way of entering the \"Schengen\" countries.\n\nLviv used to have a [[Railbus]], which has since been replaced with other means of public transport. It was a motor-rail car that ran from the largest district of Lviv to one of the largest industrial zones going through the central railway station. It made seven trips a day and was meant to provide a faster and more comfortable connection between the remote urban districts. The price in February 2010 of a one-way single ride in the rail bus was 1.50 UAH. On 15 June 2010, the route was cancelled as unprofitable.\n\n=== Air transport ===\n[[File:Ph-mjp1.jpg|thumb|[[Lviv International Airport]]]]\nBeginnings of aviation in Lviv reach back to 1884 when the Aeronautic Society was opened there. The society issued its own magazine ''Astronauta'' but soon ceased to exist. In 1909 on the initiative of Edmund Libanski the Awiata Society was founded. Among its members there was a group of professors and students of the [[Lviv Polytechnic]], including [[Stefan Drzewiecki]] and Zygmunt Sochacki. Awiata was the oldest Polish organization of this kind and it concentrated its activities mainly on exhibitions such as the ''First Aviation Exhibition'' which took place in 1910 and featured models of aircraft built by Lviv students.<ref name=\"Zdzislaw Sikorski, Lotniczy Lwow\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lwow.home.pl/semper/lotniczy.html |title=Zdzislaw Sikorski, Lotniczy Lwow |publisher=Lwow.home.pl |accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1913\u20131914 brothers Tadeusz and W\u0142adys\u0142aw Floria\u0144scy built a two-seater aeroplane. When World War I broke out Austrian authorities confiscated it but did not manage to evacuate the plane in time and it was seized by the Russians who used the plane for intelligence purposes. The Floria\u0144ski brothers' plane was the first Polish-made aircraft. On 5 November 1918, a crew consisting of [[Stefan Bastyr]] and Janusz de Beaurain carried out the first ever flight under the [[Flag of Poland|Polish flag]] taking off from Lviv's Lewand\u00f3wka (now {{lang-uk|Levandivka}}) airport.<ref name=\"Zdzislaw Sikorski, Lotniczy Lwow\" /> In the interbellum period Lw\u00f3w was a major centre of gliding with a notable ''Gliding School'' in Bezmiechowa which opened in 1932. In the same year the Institute of Gliding Technology was opened in Lw\u00f3w and was the second such institute in the world. In 1938 the ''First Polish Aircraft Exhibition'' took place in the city.\n\nThe interwar Lw\u00f3w was also a major centre of the [[Polish Air Force]] with the Sixth Air Regiment located there. The Regiment was based at the Lw\u00f3w airport opened in 1924 in the suburb of Skni\u0142\u00f3w (today {{lang-uk|Sknyliv}}).

The cycling advisor in Lviv \u2013 the first such position in Ukraine \u2013 is supervising and pushing forward the execution of the cycling plan and coordinates with various people in the city. The development of cycling in Ukraine is currently hampered by outdated planning norms and the fact, that most planners didn't yet plan and experience cycling infrastructure. The update of national legislation and training for planners is therefore necessary.\n\nIn 2015, the first stations have been set up for a new [[bike-sharing]] system [[Nextbike]] \u2013 the first of its kind in Ukraine. New bike lanes are also under construction, making Lviv the most bike-friendly city in the country. The City Council plans to build an entire cycling infrastructure by 2020, with cycle lanes ({{convert|268|km|mi|abbr=off|disp=or}}) and street bike hire services.\n\n== Education ==\n{{Main|List of universities in Ukraine}}\n[[File:Lvivska politehnika2013.JPG|thumb|right|[[Lviv Polytechnic]] National University.]]\nLviv is an important education centre of Ukraine. The city contains a total of 12 [[university|universities]], 8 academies and a number of smaller schools of higher education. In addition, within Lviv, there is a total of eight institutes of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine|National Academy of Science of Ukraine]] and more than forty [[research institute]]s. These research institutes include the [[Lviv Centre of Institute for Space Research|Centre of Institute for Space Research]]; the Institute for [[Condensed Matter Physics]]; the Institute of [[Cell Biology]]; the National Institute of Strategic Studies; the Institute of Neuro-mathematical Simulation in Power Engineering; and the Institute of Ecology of the Carpathians.\n\nIn [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times, the city of Lviv was the location where the software for the [[Lunokhod]] programme was developed. The technology for the [[Venera]] series probes and the first orbital shuttle [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]] were also developed in Lviv.\n\nA considerable scientific potential is concentrated in the city: by the number of doctors of sciences, candidates of sciences, scientific organisations Lviv is the fourth city in Ukraine. Lviv is also known for ancient academic traditions, founded by the Assumption Brotherhood School and the Jesuit Collegium.

Lviv is one of the main [[Ukrainian culture|cultural centres of Ukraine]].\n\nNamed in honour of [[Leo I of Galicia|Leo]], the eldest son of [[Daniel of Galicia|Daniel]], [[King of Ruthenia]], it was the capital of the [[Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia]]<ref>Perfecky, George A. (1973). ''The Galician-Volynian Chronicle''. Munich: Wilhelm Fink Verlag. {{OCLC|902306}}</ref> from 1272 to 1349, when it was conquered by King [[Casimir III the Great]] of Poland. From 1434, it was the regional capital of the [[Ruthenian Voivodeship]] in the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]. In 1772, after the [[First Partition of Poland]], the city became the capital of the Habsburg [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]]. In 1918, for a short time, it was the capital of the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]]. Between the wars, the city was the centre of the [[Lw\u00f3w Voivodeship]] in the [[Second Polish Republic]].\n\nAfter the German-Soviet [[invasion of Poland]] in 1939, Lviv became part of the [[Soviet Union]], and in 1944\u201346 there was a [[population exchange between Poland and Soviet Ukraine]]. In 1991, it became part of the independent nation of Ukraine.\n\nAdministratively, Lviv serves as the administrative centre of [[Lviv Oblast]] and has the status of [[city of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]].\n\nLviv was the centre of the historical regions of [[Red Ruthenia]] and [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]. The historical heart of the city, with its old buildings and cobblestone streets, survived Soviet and German occupations during World War II largely unscathed. The city has many industries and institutions of [[higher education]] such as [[Lviv University]] and [[Lviv Polytechnic]]. Lviv is also the home of many cultural institutions, including a philharmonic orchestra and the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]]. The [[Old Town (Lviv)|historic city centre]] is on the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Europe#Ukraine|UNESCO World Heritage List]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Names ==\nBesides its Ukrainian name, and its ancient Ukrainian name of Lwihorod<ref>Hipolit Stupnicki.

The average altitude of Lviv is 296 metres (971 feet) above [[sea level]]. Its highest point is the ''Vysokyi Zamok'' ([[Lviv High Castle|High Castle]]), 409 meters (1342 feet) [[above mean sea level|above sea level]]. This castle has a commanding view of the historic city centre with its distinctive green-domed churches and intricate architecture.\n\nThe old [[Defensive wall|walled city]] was at the foothills of the High Castle on the banks of the [[Poltva River|River Poltva]]. In the 13th century, the river was used to transport goods. In the early 20th century, the [[Poltva River|Poltva]] was covered over in areas where it flows through the city; the river flows directly beneath the central street of Lviv, Freedom Avenue (''Prospect Svobody'') and the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]].\n\n=== Climate ===\nLviv's climate is [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') with cold winters and mild summers.<ref>{{cite journal| last = Kottek | first = M.|author2=J.

In 1358 the city became a seat of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv]], which initiated spread of [[Latin Church]] onto the Ruthenian lands.\n\nAfter Casimir had died in 1370, he was succeeded as king of Poland by his nephew, King [[Louis I of Hungary]], who in 1372 put Lviv together with the region of [[Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia]] under the administration of his relative [[Vladislaus II of Opole]], Duke of Opole.<ref name=\"Meyers Konversations-Lexikon\" /> When in 1387 W\u0142adys\u0142aw retreated from the post of its governor, Galicia-Volhynia became occupied by the [[Hungarians]], but soon [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]], the youngest daughter of Louis, but also ruler of Poland and wife of King of Poland [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]], unified it directly with the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]].<ref name=\"Meyers Konversations-Lexikon\" />\n\n=== Kingdom of Poland ===\n[[File:Lviv High Castle (Engraving).jpg|thumb|left|[[Lviv High Castle]], fragment of engraving by A.

In 1362, the [[Lviv High Castle|High Castle]] was completely rebuilt with stone replacing the previous made out of wood.

First Catholic Archbishop who resided in Lviv was Jan Rzeszowski.\n\nIn 1434, the Ruthenian domain of the Crown was transformed into the [[Ruthenian Voivodeship]]. In 1444, the city was granted the [[staple right]], which resulted in its growing prosperity and wealth, as it became one of major trading centres on the merchant routes between [[Central Europe]] and [[Black Sea]] region. It was also transformed into one of the main fortresses of the kingdom, and was a royal city, like [[Krak\u00f3w]] or [[Gda\u0144sk]]. During the 17th century, Lw\u00f3w was the second largest city of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], with the population of about 30,000.\n\nIn 1572, one of the first publishers of books in what is now Ukraine, [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fedorov]], a graduate of the [[Jagiellonian University|University of Krak\u00f3w]], settled here for a brief period. The city became a significant centre for [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] with the establishment of an Orthodox brotherhood, a Greek-Slavonic school and a printer which published the first full versions of the Bible in Church Slavonic in 1580. A [[List of Jesuit educational institutions in the Philippines|Jesuit Collegium]] was founded in 1608, and on 20 January 1661 King [[John II Casimir]] of Poland issued a decree granting it \"the honour of the academy and the title of the university\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manresa-sj.org/stamps/2_Ukraine.htm|title=Jesuits in Ukraine|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe 17th century brought invading armies of [[Swedish Empire|Swedes]], [[Hungary|Hungarians]],<ref>Cathal J.

In 1648 an army of [[Zaporozhian Cossacks|Cossacks]] and Crimean Tatars besieged the town. They captured the [[Lviv High Castle|High Castle]], murdering its defenders, but the city itself was not sacked due to the fact that the leader of the revolution [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] accepted a ransom of 250,000 ducats, and the Cossacks marched north-west towards [[Zamo\u015b\u0107]]. It was one of two major cities in Poland which was not captured during the so-called [[Deluge (history)|''Deluge'']]: the other one was [[Gda\u0144sk]] (Danzig). At that time, Lw\u00f3w witnessed a historic scene, as here King John II Casimir made his famous [[Lw\u00f3w Oath]]. On 1 April 1656, during a holy mass in Lw\u00f3w's Cathedral, conducted by the [[papal legate]] [[Pietro Vidoni]], John Casimir in a grandiose and elaborate ceremony entrusted the Commonwealth under the Blessed Virgin Mary's protection, whom he announced as ''The Queen of the Polish Crown and other of his countries''. He also swore to ''protect the Kingdom's folk from any impositions and unjust bondage''.\n\nTwo years later, John Casimir, in honour of bravery of its residents, declared Lw\u00f3w to be equal to two historic capitals of the Commonwealth, Krak\u00f3w and [[Wilno]]. In the same year, 1658, [[Pope Alexander VII]] declared the city to be [[Semper fidelis]], in recognition of its key role in defending Europe and Roman-Catholicism from Muslim invasion.\n\nIn 1672 it was surrounded by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] who also failed to conquer it. Three years later, the [[Battle of Lw\u00f3w (1675)]] took place near the city. Lw\u00f3w was captured for the first time since the [[Middle Ages]] by a foreign army in 1704 when Swedish troops under King [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] entered the city after a short siege. The [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|plague]] of the early 18th century caused the death of about 10,000 inhabitants (40% of the city's population).<ref>Karl-Erik Frandsen.

Magocsi.(2005). ''Galicia: Multicultured Land.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press,  pg. 193</ref>\n\nIn 1773, the first newspaper in Lemberg, ''Gazette de Leopoli'', began to be published. In 1784, a [[latin language]] university was opened with lectures in German, Polish and even Ruthenian; after closing again in 1805, it was reopened in 1817. By 1825 German became the sole language of instruction.<ref name=\"multi\" />\n[[File:Lwow Panorama Raclawicka.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Rac\u0142awice Panorama]] opened in 1894]]\n\nDuring the 19th century, the Austrian administration attempted to [[Germanisation|Germanise]] the city's educational and governmental institutions. Many cultural organisations which did not have a pro-German orientation were closed. After the [[revolutions of 1848]], the language of instruction at the university shifted from German to include Ukrainian and Polish. Around that time, a certain [[sociolect]] developed in the city known as the [[Lw\u00f3w dialect]]. Considered to be a type of Polish dialect, it draws its roots from numerous other languages besides Polish. In 1853, street lighting was introduced [[Ignacy \u0141ukasiewicz]] and Jan Zeh. In that year [[kerosene]] lamps were introduced as street lights. Then in 1858, these were updated to gas lamps, and in 1900 to electric ones.\n\nAfter the so-called \"[[Ausgleich]]\" of February 1867, the [[Austrian Empire]] was reformed into a dualist [[Austria-Hungary]] and a slow yet steady process of liberalisation of Austrian rule in Galicia started. From 1873, Galicia was de facto an autonomous province of [[Austria-Hungary]] with Polish and [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]], as official languages. Germanisation was halted and the censorship lifted as well. [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] was subject to the Austrian part of the Dual Monarchy, but the [[Diet of Galicia|Galician Sejm]] and provincial administration, both established in Lviv, had extensive privileges and prerogatives, especially in education, culture, and local affairs. The city started to grow rapidly, becoming the fourth largest in Austria-Hungary, according to the census of 1910. Many [[Belle \u00c9poque]] public edifices and tenement houses were erected, with many the buildings from the Austrian period, such as the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]], built in the [[Vienna|Viennese]] neo-Renaissance style.\n[[File:Sejm Galicyjski.jpg|thumb|[[Diet of Galicia|The Galician Sejm]] (till 1918), since 1920 the [[Jan Kazimierz University]]]]\n\nDuring Habsburg rule, Lviv became one of the most important Polish, Ukrainian and Jewish cultural centres. In Lviv, according to the Austrian census of 1910, which listed religion and language, 51% of the city's population were [[Roman Catholics]], 28% Jews, and 19% belonged to the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. Linguistically, 86% of the city's population used the [[Polish language]] and 11% preferred the [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]].<ref name=\"New International\" /> At that time, Lviv was home to a number of renowned Polish-language institutions, such as the [[Ossolineum]], with the second largest collection of Polish books in the world, the Polish Academy of Arts, the National Museum (since 1908), the Historical Museum of the City of Lw\u00f3w (since 1891), the [[Polish Copernicus Society of Naturalists]], the [[Polish Historical Society]], [[Lviv University|Lw\u00f3w University]], with Polish as the official language since 1882, the [[Lw\u00f3w Scientific Society]], the [[Lviv National Art Gallery|Lw\u00f3w Art Gallery]], the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet|Polish Theatre]], and the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv|Polish Archdiocese]].\n\nFurthermore, Lviv was the centre of a number of Polish independence organisations. In June 1908, [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]], [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]] and [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]] founded here the [[Union of Active Struggle]]. Two years later, the paramilitary organisation, called the [[Riflemen's Association]], was also founded in the city by Polish activists.\n\nAt the same time, Lviv became the city where famous Ukrainian writers (such as [[Ivan Franko]], [[Panteleimon Kulish]] and [[Ivan Nechuy-Levytsky]]) published their work. It was a centre of Ukrainian cultural revival. The city also housed the largest and most influential Ukrainian institutions in the world, including the [[Prosvita]] society dedicated to spreading literacy in the Ukrainian language, the [[Shevchenko Scientific Society]], the Dniester Insurance Company and base of the [[Ukrainian cooperative movement]], and it served as the seat of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholic Church]].

Those arrested were released only after they had signed papers in which they agreed to emigrate to Poland, which postwar borders were [[Territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II|to be shifted westwards]] in accordance with the [[Yalta conference]] settlements. In Yalta, despite Polish objections, the Allied leaders, Joseph Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill decided that Lviv should remain within the borders of the Soviet Union. On 16 August 1945, a border agreement<ref>[[:pl:wikisource:Umowa graniczna pomi\u0119dzy Polsk\u0105 a ZSRR z 16 sierpnia 1945 roku]] [http://pl.wikisource.org/wiki/Umowa_graniczna_pomi%C4%99dzy_Polsk%C4%85_a_ZSRR_z_16_sierpnia_1945_roku] full text of the agreement {{in lang|pl}}</ref> was signed in Moscow between the [[government of the Soviet Union]] and the [[Provisional Government of National Unity]] installed by the Soviets in Poland. In the treaty, Polish authorities formally [[cession|ceded]] the prewar eastern part of the country to the Soviet Union, agreeing to the Polish-Soviet border to be drawn according to the [[Curzon Line]]. Consequently, the agreement was [[ratification|ratified]] on 5 February 1946.\n\n=== Post-war Soviet Union ===\n[[File:\u0421\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0427\u041a2.jpg|thumb|right|Sykhiv \u2013 Lviv's largest residential neighborhood, was built in the early 1980s under Soviet rule]]\n\nIn February 1946, Lviv became a part of the Soviet Union. It is estimated that from 100,000 to 140,000 Poles were resettled from the city into the so-called [[Recovered Territories]] as a part of [[Population transfer#Central Europe|postwar population transfers]], many of them to the area of newly acquired [[Wroc\u0142aw]], formerly the German city of Breslau. Many buildings in the old part of the city are examples of Polish architecture, which flourished in Lviv after the opening of the Technical School (later Polytechnic), the first higher-education technical academy on Polish lands. Polytechnic educated generations of architects which were influential in the entire country. Examples are: the main buildings of [[Lviv Polytechnic]], [[University of Lviv]], [[Lviv Opera]], [[Lviv railway station]], former building of Galicyjska Kasa Oszcz\u0119dno\u015bci, [[Potocki Palace, Lviv|Potocki Palace]].<ref>Ihor Zhuk, 'The Architecture of Lviv from the Thirteenth to the Twentieth Centuries', s. 113</ref> During the interwar period, Lviv was striving to become a modern metropolis, so architects experimented with modernism. It was the period of the most rapid growth of the city, so one can find many examples of architecture from this time in the city.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Examples include the main building of [[Lviv Academy of Commerce]], the second Sprecher's building or building of City Electrical Facilities.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} One monument of the Polish past is the [[Adam Mickiewicz Monument, Lviv|Adam Mickiewicz Monument]] at the square bearing his name.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Many Polish pieces of art and sculpture can be found in Lviv galleries, among them works by [[Jan Piotr Norblin]], [[Marceleo Bacciarelli]], [[Kazimierz Wojniakowski]], [[Antoni Brodowski]], [[Henryk Rodakowski]], [[Artur Grottger]], [[Jan Matejko]], [[Aleksander Gierymski]], [[Jan Stanis\u0142awski (painter)|Jan Stanis\u0142awski]], [[Leon Wycz\u00f3\u0142kowski]], [[J\u00f3zef Che\u0142mo\u0144ski]], [[J\u00f3zef Mehoffer]], [[Stanis\u0142aw Wyspia\u0144ski]], [[Olga Bozna\u0144ska]], [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw S\u0142owi\u0144ski]], [[Jacek Malczewski]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Poles who stayed in Lviv have formed the organisation the [[Association of Polish Culture of the Lviv Land]].\n\nAccording to various estimates, Lviv lost between 80% and 90% of its prewar population.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=T\u00f6rnquist-Plewa |editor1-first=Barbara |title=Whose Memory?

Immigration from Russia and Russian-speaking regions of Eastern Ukraine was encouraged{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}. The prevalence of the Ukrainian-speaking population has led to the fact that under the conditions of Soviet Russification,{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Lviv became a major centre of the [[Dissident movement in the Soviet Union|dissident movement in Ukraine]] and played a key role in Ukraine's independence in 1991.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, the city expanded both in population and size mostly due to the city's rapidly growing industrial base. Due to the fight of [[SMERSH]] with the guerrilla formations of the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] the city obtained a nickname with a negative connotation of ''Banderstadt'' as the City of [[Stepan Bandera]]. The German suffix for city ''stadt'' was added instead of the Russian ''grad'' to imply alienation. Over the years the residents of the city found this so ridiculous that even people not familiar with Bandera accepted it as a sarcasm in reference to the Soviet perception of western Ukraine. In the period of [[Perestroika|liberalisation from the Soviet system]] in the 1980s, the city became the centre of political movements advocating Ukrainian independence from the USSR. By the time of the fall of the Soviet Union the name became a proud mark for the Lviv natives culminating in the creation of a local rock band under the name ''Khloptsi z Bandershtadtu'' (Boys from Banderstadt).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bandershtadt.w6.ru/ |title=Official site of the Khloptsi z Bandershtadtu |publisher=Bandershtadt.w6.ru |accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Independent Ukraine ===\nCitizens of Lviv strongly supported [[Viktor Yushchenko]] during the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election]] and played a key role in the [[Orange Revolution]].

After Casimir III conquered Lviv in 1349 the Jewish citizens received many privileges equal to that of other citizens of Poland. Lviv had two separate [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Jewish quarters]], one within the city walls and one outside on the outskirts of the city. Each had its separate [[synagogue]], although they shared a cemetery, which was also used by the [[Crimean Karaite]] community. Before 1939 there were 97 synagogues.\n\nBefore the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] about one-third of the city's population was made up of Jews (more than 140,000 on the eve of World War II). This number swelled to about 240,000 by the end of 1940 as tens of thousands of Jews fled from the Nazi-occupied parts of Poland into the relative (and temporary) sanctuary of Soviet-occupied Poland (including Lviv) following the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact that divided Poland into Nazi and Soviet zones in 1939. Almost all these Jews were killed in the Holocaust. Meanwhile, the Nazis also destroyed the Jewish cemetery, which was subsequently \"paved over by the Soviets\".<ref name=\"erasedvanishingtraces\"/>\n\nAfter the war, a new Jewish population was formed from among the hundreds of thousands of Russians and Ukrainians that migrated to the city. The post-war Jewish population peaked at 30,000 in the 1970s. Currently, the Jewish population has shrunk considerably as a result of [[emigration]] (mainly to Israel and the United States) and, to a lesser degree, [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation]], and is estimated at 1,100.

The city is known as a centre of art, literature, music and theatre. Nowadays, the indisputable evidence of the city cultural richness is a big number of theatres, concert halls, creative unions, and also the high number of many artistic activities (more than 100 festivals annually, 60 museums, 10 theatres).\n\n[[Old Town (Lviv)|Lviv's historic centre]] has been on the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage list]] since 1998.

In recent centuries Lviv was spared some of the invasions and wars that destroyed other [[List of cities in Ukraine|Ukrainian cities]]. Its architecture reflects various European styles and periods. \nAfter the fires of 1527 and 1556 Lviv lost most of its [[gothic architecture|gothic]]-style buildings but it retains many buildings in [[renaissance architecture|renaissance]], [[baroque architecture|baroque]] and the [[classical architecture|classic]] styles. There are works by artists of the [[Vienna Secession]], [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]].\n\nThe buildings have many stone sculptures and carvings, particularly on large doors, which are hundreds of years old. The remains of old churches dot the central cityscape. Some three- to five-storey buildings have hidden inner courtyards and grottoes in various states of repair. Some cemeteries are of interest: for example, the [[Lychakiv Cemetery|Lychakivskiy Cemetery]] where the Polish elite was buried for centuries. Leaving the central area the [[architectural style]] changes radically as Soviet-era [[high-rise]] blocks dominate. In the centre of the city, the [[History of the Soviet Union|Soviet era]] is reflected mainly in a few modern-style national monuments and sculptures.\n\nFile:ProspektSvobodyLviv.jpg|Early 20th century architecture in Lviv\n\n=== Monuments ===\n[[File:Lviv - Church of Transfiguration 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Inside the [[Church of Transfiguration, Lviv|Church of the Transfiguration]]]]\n[[File:\u0423\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0446\u0435\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044c \u0432 \u041b\u044c\u0432\u043e\u0432.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Dormition Church, Lviv|Church of the Assumption]]]]\n[[File:Chapel-of-Boim-family.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Chapel of the Boim family]]]]\n\nOutdoor sculptures in the city commemorate many notable individuals and topics reflecting the rich and complex [[history of Lviv]]. There are monuments to [[Adam Mickiewicz]], [[Ivan Franko]], [[Daniel of Galicia|King Danylo]], [[Taras Shevchenko]], [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fedorov]], [[Solomiya Krushelnytska]], [[Ioan Potcoav\u0103|Ivan Pidkova]], [[Mykhailo Hrushevskyi]], [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Jan Kili\u0144ski]], [[Ivan Trush]], [[Saint George]], [[Wojciech Bartosz G\u0142owacki|Bartosz G\u0142owacki]], the monument to the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], to [[Nikifor]], [[The Good Soldier \u0160vejk]], [[Stepan Bandera]], [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]], and many others.\n\nDuring the [[interwar period]] there were monuments commemorating important figures of the history of Poland. Some of them were moved to the Polish \"[[Recovered Territories]]\" after World War II, like the monument to [[Aleksander Fredro]] which now is in [[Wroc\u0142aw]], the monument of King [[John III Sobieski]] which after 1945 was moved to [[Gda\u0144sk]], and the monument of [[Kornel Ujejski]] which is now in [[Szczecin]]. A book market takes place around the monument to [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan F\u0435dorovych]], a typographer in the 16th century who fled Moscow and found a new home in Lviv.\n\nNew ideas came to Lviv during the Austro\u2013Hungarian rule. In the 19th century, many [[publishing]] houses, newspapers and magazines were established. Among these was the [[Ossolineum]] which was one of the most important Polish scientific libraries. Most Polish-language books and publications of the Ossolineum library are still kept in a local Jesuit church. In 1997 the Polish government asked the [[Government of Ukraine|Ukrainian government]] to return these documents to Poland. Subsequently, in 2003 Ukraine allowed access to these publications for the first time. In 2006 an office of the Ossolineum (which now is located in [[Wroc\u0142aw]]) was opened in Lviv and began a process to scan all its documents. Works written in Lviv contributed to Austrian, [[Ukrainian literature|Ukrainian]], Yiddish, and [[Polish literature]], with a multitude of translations.\n\n=== Religion ===\nLviv is a city of religious variety. [[Religion]] (2012): Catholic: 57% ([[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] 56% and [[Roman Catholic Church]] 1%) [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]]: 32%, [[Protestantism]]: 2% [[Judaism]] : 0.1% Other religion: 3% Indifferent to religious matters: 4% [[Atheism]]: 1.9%<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140429045226/http://city-institute.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=231:who-is-he-the-citizen-of-lviv&catid=1:latest Who is he, the citizen of Lviv?| Lviv City Institute].</ref>\n\n==== Christianity ====\nAt one point, over 60 churches existed in the city. The largest [[Christian Church]]es have existed in the city since the 13th century. The city has been the seat of the Catholic Church in 3 rites: The [[Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Lviv]], the [[Roman Catholics]], and the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Church]]. Each has had a diocesan seat in Lviv since the 16th century. At the end of the 16th century, the Orthodox community in Ukraine [[Union of Brest|transferred their allegiance]] to the [[Pope]] in Rome and became the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. This bond was forcibly dissolved in 1946 by the Soviet authorities and the Roman Catholic community was forced out by the expulsion of the Polish population. Since 1989, religious life in Lviv has experienced a revival.\n\nLviv is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv]], the centre of the [[Roman Catholicism in Ukraine|Roman Catholic Church in Ukraine]] and until 21 August 2005 was the centre of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. About 35 percent of religious buildings belong to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, 11.5 percent to the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]], 9 per cent to the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate|Ukrainian Orthodox Church \u2013 Kiev Patriarchate]] and 6 per cent to the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]].\n\nUntil 2005, Lviv was the only city with two Catholic [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinals]]: [[Lubomyr Husar]] ([[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Byzantine Rite]]) and [[Marian Jaworski]] ([[Catholic Church|Latin Rite]]).\n\nIn June 2001, [[Pope John Paul II]] visited the [[Latin Cathedral, Lviv|Latin Cathedral]], [[St. George's Cathedral, Lviv|St. George's Cathedral]] and the [[Armenian Cathedral, Lviv|Armenian Cathedral]].\n\n==== Judaism ====\nLviv historically had a large and active Jewish community and until 1941 at least 45 [[synagogue]]s and prayer houses existed. Even in the 16th century, two separate communities existed. One lived in today's old town with the other in the [[Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie]]. The [[Golden Rose Synagogue (Lviv)|Golden Rose Synagogue]] was built in Lviv in 1582. In the 19th century, a more differentiated community started to spread out. Liberal Jews sought more [[cultural assimilation]] and spoke German and Polish. On the other hand, [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jews]] tried to retain the old traditions. Between 1941 and 1944, the Germans in effect completely destroyed the centuries-old Jewish tradition of Lviv. Most synagogues were destroyed and the Jewish population forced first into a ghetto before being forcibly transported to concentration camps where they were murdered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.holocaust.kiev.ua/eng/seminarse/lviv.htm#vip2|title=International Forum:\"Challenge of Holocaust and Its Lessons\"|work=Lviv Polytechnic National University Regional Holocaust Study Center: Ukrainian Holocaust History Study Center|date=November 2003|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308035832/http://www.holocaust.kiev.ua/eng/seminarse/lviv.htm |archive-date=8 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nUnder the Soviet Union, synagogues remained closed and were used as warehouses or cinemas. Only since the fall of the [[Iron Curtain]], has the remainder of the Jewish community experienced a faint revival.\n\nCurrently, the only functioning Orthodox Jewish synagogue in Lviv is the [[Beis Aharon V'Yisrael Synagogue]].\n\n=== Arts ===\n[[File:Lwowska Galeria Sztuki - Wn\u0119trza 01.JPG|thumb|left|A room in the <br /> [[Lviv National Art Gallery]]]]\n\nThe range of artistic Lviv is impressive. On the one hand, it is the city of classical art. Lviv Opera and Lviv Philharmonic are places that can satisfy the demands of true appraisers of the classical arts. This is the city of one of the most distinguished sculptors in Europe, [[Johann Georg Pinsel|Johann Georg Pinzel]], whose works can be seen on the fa\u00e7ade of the [[St. George's Cathedral, Lviv|St. George's Cathedral]] in Lviv and in the Pinzel Museum. This is also the city of [[Solomiya Krushelnytska]], who began her career as a singer of Lviv Opera and later became the prima donna of La Scala Opera in Milan.\n\nThe \"Group Artes\" was a young movement founded in 1929. Many of the artists studied in Paris and travelled throughout Europe. They worked and experimented in different areas of modern art: [[Futurism]], [[Cubism]], [[New Objectivity]] and [[Surrealism]]. Co\u2013operation took place between avant-garde musicians and authors. Altogether thirteen exhibitions by \"''Artes''\" took place in Warsaw, Krak\u00f3w, \u0141\u00f3dz and Lviv. The German occupation put an end to this group. Otto Hahn was executed in 1942 in Lviv and Aleksander Riemer was murdered in Auschwitz in 1943.<ref>Kosmolinska, Natalia (2007). \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=KFbmtdibpIMC&pg=PA224 Ein Fenster zur Moderne: Das Atelier der Sielskis].\" In: Hermann Simon, Irene Stratenwerth, & Ronald Hinrichs (Eds.), ''Lemberg: Eine Reise nach Europa'' Berlin: Christoph Links Verlag. pp. 218\u2013227; here: p. 224.</ref> Henryk Streng and Margit Reich-Sielska were able to escape the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] (or Shoah). Most of the surviving members of Artes lived in Poland after 1945. Only Margit Reich-Sielska (1900\u20131980) and Roman Sielski (1903\u20131990) stayed in Soviet Lviv. For years the city was one of the most important cultural centres of Poland with such writers as [[Aleksander Fredro]], [[Gabriela Zapolska]], [[Leopold Staff]], [[Maria Konopnicka]] and [[Jan Kasprowicz]] living in Lviv.\n\nToday Lviv is a city of fresh ideas and unusual characters. There are about 20 galleries (The \"Dzyga\" Gallery, \u0410rt-Gallery \"Primus\", Gallery of the History of Ukrainian Military Uniforms, Gallery of Modern Art \"Zelena Kanapa\" and others).

An electric tram was introduced on 31 May 1894. The last horse-drawn line was transferred to electric traction in 1908. In 1922 the tramways were switched to driving on the right-hand side. After the annexation of the city by the Soviet Union, several lines were closed but most of the infrastructure was preserved. The tracks are [[narrow gauge railway|narrow-gauge]], unusual for the Soviet Union, but explained by the fact that the system was built while the city was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and needed to run in narrow medieval streets in the centre of town. The Lviv tramway system now runs about 220 cars on {{convert|75|km|0|abbr=off}} of track. Many tracks were reconstructed around 2006. The price in February 2019 of a tram/trolleybus ticket was 5 UAH (reduced fare ticket was 2.5 UAH, e.g. for students). The ticket may be purchased from the driver.\n\nAfter World War II the city grew rapidly due to evacuees returning from Russia, and the Soviet Government's vigorous development of [[heavy industry]]. This included the transfer of entire factories from the Urals and others to the newly \"liberated\" territories of the USSR. The city centre tramway lines were replaced with [[trolleybus]]es on 27 November 1952. New lines were opened to the [[Tower block|blocks of flats]] at the city outskirts. The network now runs about 100 trolleybuses \u2013 mostly of the 1980s Skoda 14Tr and [[:uk:\u041b\u0410\u0417 52522|LAZ 52522]]. In 2006\u20132008 11 modern [[Low floor|low-floor]] trolleybuses (LAZ E183) built by the [[Lviv Bus Factory]] were purchased. The public [[bus network]] is represented by mini-buses (so-called ''marshrutka'') and large buses mainly LAZ and MAN. On 1 January 2013 the city had 52 public bus routes. The price is 7.00 UAH regardless of the distance traveled.

Lviv railway is one of the oldest in Ukraine. The first train arrived in Lviv on 4 November 1861. The main [[Lviv Rail Terminal|Lviv Railway Station]], designed by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sad\u0142owski]], was built in 1904 and was considered one of the best in Europe from both the architectural and the technical aspects.\n\nIn the inter-war period, Lviv (known then as Lw\u00f3w) was one of the most important hubs of the [[Polish State Railways]]. The Lw\u00f3w junction consisted of four stations in mid-1939 \u2013 main station ''Lw\u00f3w G\u0142\u00f3wny'' (now {{lang-uk|Lviv Holovnyi}}), Lw\u00f3w Klepar\u00f3w (now ''Lviv Klepariv''), ''Lw\u00f3w \u0141yczak\u00f3w'' (now ''Lviv Lychakiv''), and ''Lw\u00f3w Podzamcze'' (now ''Lviv Pidzamche''). In August 1939 just before World War II, 73 trains departed daily from the Main Station including 56 local and 17 fast trains. Lw\u00f3w was directly connected with all major centres of the Second Polish Republic as well as such cities as Berlin, [[Bucharest]], and [[Budapest]].<ref>Urz\u0119dowy Rozk\u0142ad Jazdy i Lot\u00f3w PKP, Lato 1939 (Polish State Railroads Timetable, Summer 1939)</ref>\n\nCurrently, several trains cross the nearby Polish\u2013Ukrainian border (mostly via [[Przemy\u015bl]] in Poland). There are good connections to Slovakia ([[Ko\u0161ice]]) and Hungary ([[Budapest]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Many routes have overnight trains with sleeping compartments. Lviv railway is often called the main gateway from Ukraine to Europe although buses are often a cheaper and more convenient way of entering the \"Schengen\" countries.\n\nLviv used to have a [[Railbus]], which has since been replaced with other means of public transport. It was a motor-rail car that ran from the largest district of Lviv to one of the largest industrial zones going through the central railway station. It made seven trips a day and was meant to provide a faster and more comfortable connection between the remote urban districts. The price in February 2010 of a one-way single ride in the rail bus was 1.50 UAH. On 15 June 2010, the route was cancelled as unprofitable.\n\n=== Air transport ===\n[[File:Ph-mjp1.jpg|thumb|[[Lviv International Airport]]]]\nBeginnings of aviation in Lviv reach back to 1884 when the Aeronautic Society was opened there. The society issued its own magazine ''Astronauta'' but soon ceased to exist. In 1909 on the initiative of Edmund Libanski the Awiata Society was founded. Among its members there was a group of professors and students of the [[Lviv Polytechnic]], including [[Stefan Drzewiecki]] and Zygmunt Sochacki. Awiata was the oldest Polish organization of this kind and it concentrated its activities mainly on exhibitions such as the ''First Aviation Exhibition'' which took place in 1910 and featured models of aircraft built by Lviv students.<ref name=\"Zdzislaw Sikorski, Lotniczy Lwow\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lwow.home.pl/semper/lotniczy.html |title=Zdzislaw Sikorski, Lotniczy Lwow |publisher=Lwow.home.pl |accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1913\u20131914 brothers Tadeusz and W\u0142adys\u0142aw Floria\u0144scy built a two-seater aeroplane. When World War I broke out Austrian authorities confiscated it but did not manage to evacuate the plane in time and it was seized by the Russians who used the plane for intelligence purposes. The Floria\u0144ski brothers' plane was the first Polish-made aircraft. On 5 November 1918, a crew consisting of [[Stefan Bastyr]] and Janusz de Beaurain carried out the first ever flight under the [[Flag of Poland|Polish flag]] taking off from Lviv's Lewand\u00f3wka (now {{lang-uk|Levandivka}}) airport.<ref name=\"Zdzislaw Sikorski, Lotniczy Lwow\" /> In the interbellum period Lw\u00f3w was a major centre of gliding with a notable ''Gliding School'' in Bezmiechowa which opened in 1932. In the same year the Institute of Gliding Technology was opened in Lw\u00f3w and was the second such institute in the world. In 1938 the ''First Polish Aircraft Exhibition'' took place in the city.\n\nThe interwar Lw\u00f3w was also a major centre of the [[Polish Air Force]] with the Sixth Air Regiment located there. The Regiment was based at the Lw\u00f3w airport opened in 1924 in the suburb of Skni\u0142\u00f3w (today {{lang-uk|Sknyliv}}).
