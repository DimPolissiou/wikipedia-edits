{"title_page": "Blowback (firearms)", "text_new": "{{more footnotes|date=February 2014}}\n'''Blowback''' is a system of operation for [[Semi-automatic firearm|self-loading]] [[firearm]]s that obtains energy from the motion of the [[cartridge case]] as it is pushed to the rear by expanding gas created by the ignition of the [[propellant charge]].<ref name=\"Chinn\">{{harvnb|Chinn|1955|p=3}}</ref>\n\nSeveral blowback systems exist within this broad principle of operation, each distinguished by the methods used to control [[bolt (firearms)|bolt]] movement.  In most actions that use blowback operation, the [[Breech-loading weapon|breech]] is not locked mechanically at the time of firing: the inertia of the bolt and recoil spring(s), relative to the weight of the bullet, delay opening of the breech until the bullet has left the barrel.<ref>Walter H. B. Smith, ''Rifles'', Military Service Publishing Co., 1948,  \"blowback semiautomatic operation\" pp.88-89.</ref>  A few locked breech designs use a form of blowback (example: primer actuation) to perform the unlocking function.\n\nThe blowback principle may be considered a simplified form of gas operation, since the cartridge case behaves like a piston driven by the powder gases.<ref name=\"Chinn\"/> Other operating principles for self-loading firearms include [[blow forward]], [[Gas-operated reloading|gas operation]], and [[recoil operation]].\n\n==Principle of operation==\nThe blowback system is generally defined as an operating system in which energy to operate the firearm's various mechanisms and provide automation is derived from the movement of the spent cartridge case pushed out of the chamber by rapidly expanding powder gases.<ref name=\"Chinn_11\">{{harvnb|Chinn|1955|p=11}}</ref> This rearward thrust, imparted against the breech, is a direct result of the expansion of propellant gases.<ref name=\"Chinn_11\"/> Certain guns will use energy from blowback to perform the entire operating cycle (these are typically designs using relatively \"low pressure\" ammunition) while others will use a portion of the blowback to operate only certain parts of the cycle or simply use the blowback energy to enhance the operational energy from another system of automatic operation.<ref name=\"Chinn_11\"/>\n\nWhat is common to all blowback systems is that the cartridge case must move under the direct action of the powder pressure, therefore any gun in which the bolt is not rigidly locked and permitted to move while there remains powder pressure in the chamber will undergo a degree of blowback action.<ref name=\"Chinn_11\"/> The energy from the expansion of gases on firing appears in the form of kinetic energy transmitted to the bolt mechanism, which is controlled and used to operate the firearm's operation cycle. The extent to which blowback is employed largely depends on the manner used to control the movement of the bolt and the proportion of energy drawn from other systems of operation.<ref name=\"Chinn\"/> How the movement of the bolt is controlled is where blowback systems differ. Blowback operation is most often divided into three categories, all using residual pressure to complete the cycle of operation: '''simple blowback''' (often just \"blowback\"), '''delayed/retarded blowback''', and '''advanced primer ignition.'''\n\nRelating blowback to other types of automatic firearm operation, [[George M. Chinn]] wrote that: \"In the larger sense, blowback might well be considered a special form of gas operation. This is reasonable because the cartridge case may be conceived of as a sort of piston driven by the powder gases. Actually, blowback involves so many special problems that it is best considered to be in a class by itself. The question whether or not it should be included within the more general class of [[gas operation]] or [[recoil operation]] is purely academic. The important point is that it partakes some of the properties of both classes and, depending on the particular problem at hand, may be considered to be either one.\"<ref name=\"Chinn\"/>\n\n==Simple blowback==\n[[File:Firearm simple blowback animation.gif|thumb|right|221px|Animation of simple blowback operation]]\n[[File:Hammerless380.jpg|thumb|right|The [[.380 ACP]] [[Colt Model 1903 Pocket Hammerless]] uses simple blowback. The mass of the [[Pistol slide|slide]] is enough to delay opening of the chamber until pressure has dropped.]]\n\nThe blowback (sometimes referred to as \"simple\", \"straight\" or \"pure\" blowback) system represents the most basic auto loading operation type.  In a blowback mechanism, the bolt rests against the rear of the barrel, but is not locked in place.  At the point of ignition, expanding gases push the bullet forward through the barrel while at the same time pushing the case rearward against the bolt.  The expanding gases push the bolt assembly to the rear, but the motion is slowed by the mass of the bolt, internal friction, and the force required to compress the action spring.  The design must ensure that the delay is long enough that the bullet exits the barrel before the cartridge case clears the chamber.  The empty case is ejected as the bolt travels to the rear.  The stored energy of the compressed action spring then drives the bolt forward (although not until the trigger is pulled if the weapon [[Open bolt|fires from an open bolt]]).  A new cartridge is stripped from the magazine and chambered as the bolt returns to its in-battery position.\n\nThe blowback system is practical for firearms using relatively low-power cartridges with lighter weight bullets.  Higher power cartridges require heavier bolts to keep the breech from opening prematurely; at some point, the bolt becomes too heavy to be practical.  For an extreme example, a 20mm cannon using simple blowback and lubricated cartridges would need a {{convert|500|lb|kg|adj=on}} bolt to keep the cartridge safely in the barrel during the first few milliseconds; furthermore, the average force supplied by the return spring is limited to {{convert|60|lbf|N}} or the bolt will not travel back far enough to feed a new round. Consequently, the return spring is not powerful enough to keep the bolt closed when the gun is tilted up. In addition, there is not enough energy stored in the bolt to cycle the weapon.<ref>{{harvnb|Chinn|1955|pp=12\u201316}}</ref>\n\nDue to the required bolt weight, blowback designs in pistols are generally limited to calibers smaller than [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]] (e.g., [[.25 ACP]], [[.32 ACP]], [[.380 ACP]], [[9\u00d718mm Makarov]], etc.) There are exceptions such as the simple blowback pistols from [[Hi-Point Firearms]] which include models chambered in [[.45 ACP]], [[.40 S&W]], [[.380 ACP]] and [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hi-pointfirearms.com/handguns/hi_point_handguns.html |title=Hi-Point Firearms: Handguns |work=Hi-Point Firearms |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711165408/http://www.hi-pointfirearms.com/handguns/hi_point_handguns.html |archivedate=2011-07-11 }}</ref> Simple blowback operation can also be found in small-bore (such as [[.22 Long Rifle|.22LR]]) semi-automatic [[rifle]]s, [[carbine]]s and [[submachine gun]]s.  Most simple blowback rifles are chambered for the [[.22 Long Rifle]] cartridge. Popular examples include the [[Marlin Model 60]] and the [[Ruger 10/22]]. Most blowback carbines and submachine guns are chambered for pistol cartridges such as the 9\u00d719mm Parabellum, .40 S&W and .45 ACP. Examples include the [[MP 40]], [[Sten]] and [[UZI]].  The bolt can be made bigger and more massive in these weapons than in handguns, as they are intrinsically heavier and designed, ideally at least, to be fired with both hands, often with the aid of a shoulder stock; and these factors help to ameliorate the disruption to the shooter's aim caused by the heavy bolt's movement. Consequently, simple blowback is adequate for somewhat more powerful rounds in submachine guns than in standard pistols. There were also a few rifles that chambered cartridges specifically designed for blowback operation. Examples include the [[Winchester Model 1905]], [[Winchester Model 1907|1907]] and [[Winchester Model 1910|1910]]. The only known assault rifle to use simple blowback was the Burton Model 1917.<ref>The World's Assault Rifles By Gary Paul Johnston, Thomas B. Nelson. Chapter 2: Assault Rifle Operating and Locking Systems.</ref>\n\nWhereas simple blowback is limited to guns using low-power rounds, it is so efficient in this context that in small-calibre [[semi-automatic pistols]] it is by now almost ubiquitous.  Heavier calibre semiautomatic handguns typically employ a [[Recoil operation|short recoil system]], of which by far the most common type are [[John Browning#Products|Browning]]-derived designs which rely on a locking barrel and [[Pistol slide|slide]] assembly instead of blowback. But blowback guns can be used to fire powerful cartridges if they are of the other two types already mentioned: API or delayed blowback.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Advanced primer ignition (API) blowback==\n{{stack\n | [[File:MK108 bolt cycle AB.png|thumb|right|[[MK 108 cannon]] bolt cycle (part I)]]\n | [[File:MK108 bolt cycle CD.png|thumb|right|[[MK 108 cannon]] bolt cycle (part II)]]\n}}\nIn the API blowback design, the primer is ignited when the bolt is still moving forward and before the cartridge is fully chambered. This requires a very careful design to ensure the proper balance and equalization of forces between the projectile weight, propellant charge, barrel length, bolt weight, and return spring strength. In a simple blowback design, the propellant gases have to overcome static [[inertia]] to accelerate the bolt rearwards to open the breech. In an API blowback, they first have to do the work of overcoming forward [[momentum]] to arrest the forward motion of the bolt. Because the forward and rearward speeds of the bolt tend to be approximately the same, the API blowback allows the weight of the bolt to be halved.<ref name=\"Chinn_31\">{{harvnb|Chinn|1955|p=31}}</ref> Because the momentum of the two opposed bolt motions cancels out over time, the API blowback design results in reduced recoil.\n\nAccording to Anthony G. Williams, the \"API blowback principle is used virtually in all [[open bolt]] [[sub-machine gun]]s\" (technically, although generally these are known as \"simple blowback\" weapons due to the very late ignition of the cartridge compared to specially designed API blowback guns like the MK 108), although \"the relatively low pressures and velocities mean that extended chambers and [[rebated-rim cartridge]]s are not required\" for sub-machine guns.<ref name=\"Williams_65\">Anthony G. Williams, ''Rapid Fire'', Airlife UK 2000, page 65</ref> In heavier weapons, advanced primer ignition (API) was originally developed by Reinhold Becker<ref>[http://www.quarryhs.co.uk/apib.html Williams, Anthony G., ''Of Oerlikons and other things\u2026\u2026''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110002552/http://www.quarryhs.co.uk/apib.html |date=2014-11-10 }} www.quarry.nildram.co.uk article</ref> for use on the [[Becker Type M2 20 mm cannon]]. It became a feature of a wide range of designs that can be traced back to Becker's, including the [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon]] cannon widely used as anti-aircraft weapons during World War II.<ref name=\"Williams_65\"/>\n\nTo increase performance of API blowback firearms,<ref name=\"Chinn_31\"/> larger calibre APIB guns such as the Becker and Oerlikon use extended chambers, longer than is necessary to contain the round, and ammunition for APIB firearms come with straight-sided cartridges with [[Rim (firearms)#Rebated rim|rebated rims]] (rims that are smaller in diameter than the cartridge itself).<ref name=\"Williams_63\">Anthony G. Williams, ''Rapid Fire'', Airlife UK 2000, pages 63-68</ref> The last part of forward motion and the first part of the rearward motion of the case and bolt happen within the confines of this extended chamber. As long as the gas pressure in the barrel is high, the walls of the case remain supported and the breach sealed, although the case is sliding rearwards. This sliding motion of the case, while it is expanded by a high internal gas pressure, risks tearing it apart, and a common solution is to grease the ammunition to reduce the friction. The case needs to have a rebated rim because the front end of the bolt will enter the chamber, and the extractor claw hooked over the rim therefore has to fit also within the diameter of the chamber. The case generally has very little neck, because this remains unsupported during the firing cycle and is generally deformed; a strongly necked case would be likely to split.\n\nThe API blowback design permits the use of more powerful ammunition in a lighter gun than would be achieved by using simple blowback, and the reduction of felt recoil results in further weight savings. The original Becker cannon, firing 20\u00d770mmRB ammunition, was developed to be carried by World War I aircraft, and weighed only 30&nbsp;kg.<ref name=\"Williams_89\">Anthony G. Williams, ''Flying Gun World War I'', Airlife UK 2003, pages 89-90</ref> Oerlikon even produced an anti-tank rifle firing 20\u00d7110mmRB ammunition using the API blowback operation, the [[Oerlikon SSG36|SSG36]]. On the other hand, because the design imposes a very close relationship between bolt mass, chamber length, spring strength, ammunition power and rate of fire, in APIB guns high rate of fire and high muzzle velocity tend to be mutually exclusive.<ref name=\"Williams_63\"/> API blowback guns also have to fire from an open bolt, which is not conducive to accuracy and also prevents [[synchronization gear|synchronized]] fire through an aircraft propeller arc.\n\nAccording to a [[United States Army Materiel Command]] engineering course from 1970, \"The advanced primer ignition gun is superior to the simple blowback because of its higher firing rate and lower recoil momentum. However, favorable performance depends on timing that must be precise. A slight delay in primer function, and the gun reverts to a simple blowback without the benefit of a massive bolt and stiffer driving spring to soften the recoil impact. [...] The exacting requirements in design and construction of gun and ammunition reduce this type almost to the point of academic interest only.\"<ref>[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=AD0868578 Automatic Weapons] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801182437/http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=AD0868578 |date=2013-08-01 }}, [[United States Army Materiel Command|AMC]] pamphlet no. 706-260, February 1970, page 2{{hyphen}}47<!-- this not a page range, but a single page number --></ref>\n\nAPI mechanisms are very sensitive to the ammunition used. For example, when the Germans switched their [[MG FF]] (an Oerlikon FFF derivative) to their new, lighter [[Minengescho\u00df]] shell, they had to rebalance the spring strength and bolt weight of the gun, resulting in a new MG FF/M model with ammunition not being interchangeable between the two models.<ref name=\"Williams_166\">Anthony G. Williams, ''Rapid Fire'', Airlife UK 2000, pages 65 and 166</ref> The 30&nbsp;mm [[MK 108 cannon]] was perhaps the apogee of API blowback technology during World War II.\n\nAn example of API in sub-machine guns is the L2A3 [[Sterling submachine gun]], where the maximum chamber pressure is achieved while the breechblock is still moving forward and is about 0.46&nbsp;mm away from the rear face of the chamber.<ref name=\"Cutshaw2011\">{{cite book|author=Charles Q.

As with the resistance provided by momentum in API, it takes a fraction of a second for the propellant gases to overcome this and start moving cartridge and bolt backwards; this very brief delay is sufficient for the bullet to leave the muzzle and for the internal pressure in the barrel to decrease to a safe level.  The bolt and cartridge are then pushed to the rear by the residual gas pressure.   \n\nBecause of high pressures, rifle-caliber delayed blowback firearms, such as the [[FAMAS]] and [[Heckler & Koch G3|G3]], typically have fluted chambers to ease extraction. Below are various forms of delayed-blowback actions:\n\n===Roller-delayed===\n[[File:Roller delayed blowback action.svg|thumb|right|Roller-delayed blowback-operated breech for automatic weapons]]\n[[File:G3 Bolt.PNG|thumb|upright|A schematic of the G3 roller-delayed blowback mechanism]]\n[[File:DCB Shooting G3 Roller system3.JPG|thumb|upright|Cutaway model of the chamber with gas relief flutes (left) and roller-delayed action of the G3 assault rifle]]\n[[File:US Patent 3283435 8-Nov-1966 BREECH CLOSURE Theodor Koch.png|thumb|right|A schematic of the roller-delayed blowback mechanism used in the [[Heckler & Koch MP5|MP5]] [[submachine gun]]. This system had its origins in the late-war [[StG 45(M)]] [[assault rifle]] prototype.]]\n\nRoller-delayed blowback was first used in [[Mauser]]'s [[StG 45(M)|Ger\u00e4t 06H]] prototype. Roller-delayed blowback operation differs from [[Roller locked|roller-locked]] [[recoil operation]] as seen in the [[MG 42]] and gas operated roller locked, as seen in the Ger\u00e4t 06.<ref>{{Citation|last=Forgotten Weapons|title=Last Ditch Innovation: The Development of the Gerat 06 and Gerat 06H Rifles|date=2012-11-19|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WEPwmYcCPFs|accessdate=2017-11-30}}</ref> Unlike the MG 42, in roller-delayed blowback the barrel is fixed and does not recoil, and unlike the StG 44, roller-delayed blowback systems lack a gas piston. These omissions are conducive to relatively light construction by significantly reducing the number of parts required and the amount of machining required to reduce a rifle. As the bolt head is driven rearward, rollers on the sides of the bolt are driven inward against a tapered bolt carrier extension. This forces the bolt carrier rearward at a much greater velocity and delays movement of the bolt head. The primary advantage of roller-delayed blowback is the simplicity of the design compared to gas or recoil operation.<ref>Stevens, R. Blake, ''Full Circle: A Treatise on Roller Locking'', Collector Grade Publications (2006). {{ISBN|0-88935-400-6}}.</ref>\n\nThe roller-delayed blowback firearm action was patented by Mausers Wilhelm St\u00e4hle and [[Ludwig Vorgrimler]]. Though appearing simple its development during World War II was a hard technical and personal effort, as German engineering, mathematical and other scientists had to work together on a like-it-or-not basis led by [[Ott-Helmuth von Lossnitzer]], the director of [[Mauser|Mauser Werke's]] Weapons Research Institute and Weapons Development Group. Experiments showed roller-delayed blowback firearms exhibited bolt-bounce as the bolt opened at an extreme velocity of approximately {{convert|20|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}} during automatic fire. To counter bolt-bounce the perfect angle choice on the nose of the bolt head had to be found to significantly reduce the opening velocity of the bolt. The extremely high bolt carrier velocities problem was not solved by trial and error. Mathematician Dr. Karl Maier provided analysis of the components, assemblies in the development project.<ref>[https://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2013/01/01/do-you-know-your-hks-parents/ Do You Know Your HK\u2019s Parents?]</ref> In December 1943 Maier came up with an equation that engineers used to change the angles in the receiver to 45\u00b0 and 27\u00b0 on the locking piece relative to the longitudinal axis reducing the bolt-bounce problem. With these angles the geometrical transmission ratio of the bolt carrier to the bolthead became 3:1, so the rear bolt carrier was forced to move 3 times faster than the bolthead. The rearward forces on the bolt carrier and receiver were 2:1. The force and impulse transmitted to the receiver increases with the force and impulse transmitted to the bolt carrier. Making the bolt carrier heavier lessens the recoil velocity. For Mausers [[StG 45(M)]] project Maier assumed a {{convert|120|g|oz|1|abbr=on}} bolt head and {{convert|360|g|oz|1|abbr=on}} bolt carrier (1 to 3 ratio). The prototype StG 45 (M) assault rifle had 18 longitudinal gas relief flutes cut in the [[Chamber (firearms)|chamber]] wall to assist the bloated cartridge casing from the chamber walls during extraction. Fluting the end of the chamber provides pressure equalization between the front outer surface of the cartridge case and its interior and thus ensures extraction without tearing the case making extraction easier and more reliable. In 1944 other German companies like Gro\u00dffu\u00df, Rheinmetall and Haenel showed interest in developing roller-delayed blowback small arms. Gro\u00dffu\u00df worked on a roller-delayed blowback [[MG 45]] general-purpose machine gun that, like the StG 45 (M), had not progressed beyond the prototype stage by the end of World War II.\n\nAfter World War II, former Mauser technicians Ludwig Vorgrimler and Theodor L\u00f6ffler perfected the mechanism between 1946 and 1950 while working for the French small arms manufacturer [[Atelier M\u00e9canique de Mulhouse|Centre d'Etudes et d'Armament de Mulhouse]] (CEAM). In 1950 Ludwig Vorgrimler was recruited to work for [[CETME]] in Spain. The first full-scale production rifle to utilize roller-delay was the Spanish [[CETME rifle|CETME battle rifle]], which was closely followed by the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[SIG SG 510]] and the CETME Model B-based [[Heckler & Koch G3]]. The G3 bolt features an anti-bounce mechanism that prevents the bolt from bouncing off the barrel's breech surface.<ref name=\"wo\u017aniak\">Wo\u017aniak, Ryszard. Encyklopedia najnowszej broni palnej \u2013 tom 2 G-\u0141. Bellona. 2001. pp. 7\u201310.</ref> The G3's \"bolt head locking lever\" is a spring-loaded claw mounted on the bolt carrier that grabs the bolt head as the bolt carrier group goes into battery. The lever essentially ratchets into place with friction, providing enough resistance to being re-opened that the bolt carrier does not rebound. Due to the relative low [[bolt thrust]] exhibited by pistol cartridges the anti-bounce mechanism is omitted by Heckler & Koch on their roller-delayed blowback firearms chambered for pistols cartridges. Heckler & Koch's [[Heckler & Koch MP5|MP5]] [[submachine gun]] is the most common weapon still in service worldwide using this system. The [[Heckler & Koch P9]] semi-automatic pistol, [[CETME Ameli]] light machine gun and [[Heckler & Koch HK21]] general-purpose machine gun also use it.\n\nRoller-delayed blowback arms are ammunition specific, since they lack an adjustable gas port or valve to adjust the arm to various propellant and projectile specific pressure behavior. Their reliable functioning is limited by specific ammunition and arm parameters like bullet weight, propellant charge, barrel length and amount of wear. At the moment of cartridge ignition the chamber has to be and remain sealed, until the bullet has exited the barrel and the gas pressure within the bore has dropped to a safe level before the seal is broken and chamber starts to open. For obtaining a proper and safe functioning parameters bandwith arms manufactures offer a variety of locking pieces with different mass and shoulder angles and cylindrical rollers with different diameters. The angles are critical and determine the unlock timing and gas pressure drop management as the locking piece acts in unison with the bolt head carrier. The bolt gap width determines the [[Headspace (firearms)|headspace]] and hence the correct positioning of the cartridges in the (closed) chamber. Due to usage wear the bolt gap between the locking piece and bolt head carrier is expected to gradully increase. It can be determined and checked by a [[feeler gauge]] measurement and can be altered by changing the cylindrical rollers for rollers with a different diameter. Installing larger diameter rollers will increase the bolt gap and push the locking piece forward. Installing smaller diameter rollers results in the reverse effects.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd8FrUe8fMM How Does It Work: Roller Delayed Blowback]</ref><ref>[http://firearmshistory.blogspot.com/2010/08/actions-blowback-action-roller-delayed.html Actions: Blowback Action: Roller Delayed Blowback ]</ref><ref>[https://www.internationalsportsman.com/how-roller-delayed-firearms-work-and-why-it-matters/ How Roller-Delayed Firearms Work and Why it Matters]</ref>\n\n===Lever-delayed===\n[[File:FAMAS Bolt-gr.PNG|thumb|right|A schematic of the lever-delayed blowback mechanism used in the FAMAS assault rifle.]]\nLever-delayed blowback utilizes leverage to put the bolt at a mechanical disadvantage, delaying the opening of the breech. When the cartridge pushes against the bolt face, the lever moves the bolt carrier rearward at an accelerated rate relative to the light bolt. Leverage can be applied with a dedicated part or through inclined surfaces interacting with each other. This leverage significantly increases resistance and slows the movement of the lightweight bolt. [[John Pedersen (arms designer)|John Pedersen]] patented the first known design for a lever-delay system.<ref>{{US Patent|1410270}}</ref> The mechanism was adapted by [[Hungary|Hungarian]] arms designer [[P\u00e1l Kir\u00e1ly]] in the 1930s and used in the [[Danuvia 43M submachine gun|Danuvia 39M and 43M]] submachine guns for the [[Royal Hungarian Army|Hungarian Army]]. After the [[World War II]], Kir\u00e1ly settled in the [[Dominican Republic]] and developed the [[Crist\u00f3bal Carbine]]  (or Kir\u00e1ly-Crist\u00f3bal Carbine).

The [[Bolt (firearms)|bolt]] is never locked, and so is pushed rearward by the expanding [[propellant]] gases, as in other blowback-based designs. However, propellant gases are vented from the barrel into a cylinder with a piston that delays the opening of the bolt.

This seal prevents high-pressure gas from escaping into the action of the gun. Because a conventional chamber is slightly oversized, an unfired cartridge will enter freely. In a chamber-ring delayed firearm, the chamber is conventional in every respect except for a concave ring within the chamber wall. When the cartridge is fired, the case expands into this recessed ring and pushes the bolt face rearward. As the case moves to the rear this ring constricts the expanded portion of the case. The energy required to squeeze the walls of the cartridge case slows the rearward travel of the case and slide, reducing their mass requirements. The first known use of the system was on the Fritz Mann pistol in 1920 and later on the High Standard Corp model T3 experimental pistol developed by Ott-Helmuth von Lossnitzer while working for High Standard.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.forgottenweapons.com/high-standard-t3-prototype-an-american-blowback-at-james-d-julia/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-04-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170414081723/http://www.forgottenweapons.com/high-standard-t3-prototype-an-american-blowback-at-james-d-julia/ |archive-date=2017-04-14 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://unblinkingeye.com/Guns/Mann/mann.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330143534/https://unblinkingeye.com/Guns/Mann/mann.html |archive-date=2018-03-30 |url-status=live }}</ref>  Other firearms that used this system were the LWS [[Seecamp]] pistol, the AMT Automag II, and the Kimball .30 Carbine pistol.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.seecamp.com/caremaintenance.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-02-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228090142/http://www.seecamp.com/caremaintenance.htm |archive-date=2017-02-28 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://modernfirearms.net/en/handguns/handguns-en/u-s-a-semi-automatic-pistols/amt-automag-ii-v-eng/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313214242/http://modernfirearms.net/en/handguns/handguns-en/u-s-a-semi-automatic-pistols/amt-automag-ii-v-eng/ |archive-date=2018-03-13 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.forgottenweapons.com/detroits-short-lived-kimball-30-carbine-pistol/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330143444/https://www.forgottenweapons.com/detroits-short-lived-kimball-30-carbine-pistol/ |archive-date=2018-03-30 |url-status=live }}</ref>  The [[SIG SG 510]] rifle family incorporates a chamber ring near the shoulder which is used to avoid bolt-bounce rather than a delay element.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.biggerhammer.net/sigamt/iar/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-02-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404152628/http://www.biggerhammer.net/sigamt/iar/ |archive-date=2017-04-04 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Hesitation locked===\n[[John Pedersen (arms designer)|John Pedersen]]'s patented system incorporates a breech block independent of the slide or bolt carrier. When in battery, the breech block rests slightly forward of the locking shoulder located in the frame of the firearm. When the cartridge is fired, the cartridge case, bolt and slide move together a short distance until the breech block strikes the locking shoulder and stops. The slide continues rearward with the momentum it acquired in the initial phase while the breech remains locked.

His system used a small \"piston\" that incorporates the chamber.  When the cartridge is fired, the front of the floating chamber is thrust back by gas pressure impinging on the front of the chamber as in a traditional piston.  This, added to the blowback energy imparted on the cartridge, pushes the bolt back with greater energy than either force alone.  Often described as \"accelerated blowback\", this amplifies the otherwise anemic recoil energy of the .22 Rimfire cartridge.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQY/is_3_50/ai_112646118 |title=Charles E.

Known prototypes using this method of operation include two 1936 rifle designs, one by Mihail Mamontov and another by Makar Goryainov at [[TsKB-14]], and [[Baryshev AVB-7.62|a 1980s design by A.F. Barishev]]. The Mamontov and Goryainov rifles are only partially automatic; only the bolt unlocking is powered by the gases pushing the cartridge back, while the rest of the cycle (ejection, reloading) is done manually as in a traditional bolt-action rifle. A major problem with using the case cartridge as piston is that its motion is much faster (about 1 ms) compared to tapping gas further down the bore through a piston\u2014about 5 ms in the [[Dragunov sniper rifle]], which used the same cartridge as Mamontov's rifle. Barishev made a fully automatic, but rather bulky mechanism that used a mechanical delay. In his system, the case cartridge pushed back a tilting bolt face, that upon reaching a certain angle pushes backwards an unlocking lever that continues farther before unlocking the bolt. The [[GRAU]] however still gave a negative evaluation of Barishev's gun, pointing out that the main problems with reliability of firearms using the cartridge case as a piston were known since the 1930s and still unsolved.<ref>\u0420. \u0427\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043a, [http://www.kalashnikov.ru/upload/medialibrary/03f/gilzovyi-dvigatel.pdf \u0413\u0418\u041b\u042c\u0417\u041e\u0412\u042b\u0419 \u0414\u0412\u0418\u0413\u0410\u0422\u0415\u041b\u042c. \u041e \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430\u0445 \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513011523/http://www.kalashnikov.ru/upload/medialibrary/03f/gilzovyi-dvigatel.pdf |date=May 13, 2014 }}, ''Kalashnikov'' magazine 2012/11, pp. 72-77</ref>\n\n==Limited-utility designs==\n===Blish lock===\n{{main article|Blish lock}}\nThe Blish Lock is a breech locking mechanism designed by John Bell Blish based upon his observation that under extreme pressures, certain dissimilar metals will resist movement with a force greater than normal friction laws would predict. In modern engineering terminology, it is called static friction, or ''[[stiction]]''. His locking mechanism was used in the [[Thompson submachine gun]], [[Thompson Autorifle|Autorifle]] and [[Thompson Light Rifle|Autocarbine]] designs.

In most actions that use blowback operation, the [[Breech-loading weapon|breech]] is not locked mechanically at the time of firing: the inertia of the bolt and recoil spring(s), relative to the weight of the bullet, delay opening of the breech until the bullet has left the barrel.<ref>Walter H. B. Smith, ''Rifles'', Military Service Publishing Co., 1948,  \"blowback semiautomatic operation\" pp.88-89.</ref>  A few locked breech designs use a form of blowback (example: primer actuation) to perform the unlocking function.\n\nThe blowback principle may be considered a simplified form of gas operation, since the cartridge case behaves like a piston driven by the powder gases.<ref name=\"Chinn\"/> Other operating principles for self-loading firearms include [[blow forward]], [[Gas-operated reloading|gas operation]], and [[recoil operation]].\n\n==Principle of operation==\nThe blowback system is generally defined as an operating system in which energy to operate the firearm's various mechanisms and provide automation is derived from the movement of the spent cartridge case pushed out of the chamber by rapidly expanding powder gases.<ref name=\"Chinn_11\">{{harvnb|Chinn|1955|p=11}}</ref> This rearward thrust, imparted against the breech, is a direct result of the expansion of propellant gases.<ref name=\"Chinn_11\"/> Certain guns will use energy from blowback to perform the entire operating cycle (these are typically designs using relatively \"low pressure\" ammunition) while others will use a portion of the blowback to operate only certain parts of the cycle or simply use the blowback energy to enhance the operational energy from another system of automatic operation.<ref name=\"Chinn_11\"/>\n\nWhat is common to all blowback systems is that the cartridge case must move under the direct action of the powder pressure, therefore any gun in which the bolt is not rigidly locked and permitted to move while there remains powder pressure in the chamber will undergo a degree of blowback action.<ref name=\"Chinn_11\"/> The energy from the expansion of gases on firing appears in the form of kinetic energy transmitted to the bolt mechanism, which is controlled and used to operate the firearm's operation cycle. The extent to which blowback is employed largely depends on the manner used to control the movement of the bolt and the proportion of energy drawn from other systems of operation.<ref name=\"Chinn\"/> How the movement of the bolt is controlled is where blowback systems differ. Blowback operation is most often divided into three categories, all using residual pressure to complete the cycle of operation: '''simple blowback''' (often just \"blowback\"), '''delayed/retarded blowback''', and '''advanced primer ignition.'''\n\nRelating blowback to other types of automatic firearm operation, [[George M. Chinn]] wrote that: \"In the larger sense, blowback might well be considered a special form of gas operation. This is reasonable because the cartridge case may be conceived of as a sort of piston driven by the powder gases. Actually, blowback involves so many special problems that it is best considered to be in a class by itself. The question whether or not it should be included within the more general class of [[gas operation]] or [[recoil operation]] is purely academic. The important point is that it partakes some of the properties of both classes and, depending on the particular problem at hand, may be considered to be either one.\"<ref name=\"Chinn\"/>\n\n==Simple blowback==\n[[File:Firearm simple blowback animation.gif|thumb|right|221px|Animation of simple blowback operation]]\n[[File:Hammerless380.jpg|thumb|right|The [[.380 ACP]] [[Colt Model 1903 Pocket Hammerless]] uses simple blowback. The mass of the [[Pistol slide|slide]] is enough to delay opening of the chamber until pressure has dropped.]]\n\nThe blowback (sometimes referred to as \"simple\", \"straight\" or \"pure\" blowback) system represents the most basic auto loading operation type.  In a blowback mechanism, the bolt rests against the rear of the barrel, but is not locked in place.  At the point of ignition, expanding gases push the bullet forward through the barrel while at the same time pushing the case rearward against the bolt.  The expanding gases push the bolt assembly to the rear, but the motion is slowed by the mass of the bolt, internal friction, and the force required to compress the action spring.  The design must ensure that the delay is long enough that the bullet exits the barrel before the cartridge case clears the chamber.  The empty case is ejected as the bolt travels to the rear.  The stored energy of the compressed action spring then drives the bolt forward (although not until the trigger is pulled if the weapon [[Open bolt|fires from an open bolt]]).  A new cartridge is stripped from the magazine and chambered as the bolt returns to its in-battery position.\n\nThe blowback system is practical for firearms using relatively low-power cartridges with lighter weight bullets.  Higher power cartridges require heavier bolts to keep the breech from opening prematurely; at some point, the bolt becomes too heavy to be practical.  For an extreme example, a 20mm cannon using simple blowback and lubricated cartridges would need a {{convert|500|lb|kg|adj=on}} bolt to keep the cartridge safely in the barrel during the first few milliseconds; furthermore, the average force supplied by the return spring is limited to {{convert|60|lbf|N}} or the bolt will not travel back far enough to feed a new round. Consequently, the return spring is not powerful enough to keep the bolt closed when the gun is tilted up. In addition, there is not enough energy stored in the bolt to cycle the weapon.<ref>{{harvnb|Chinn|1955|pp=12\u201316}}</ref>\n\nDue to the required bolt weight, blowback designs in pistols are generally limited to calibers smaller than [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]] (e.g., [[.25 ACP]], [[.32 ACP]], [[.380 ACP]], [[9\u00d718mm Makarov]], etc.) There are exceptions such as the simple blowback pistols from [[Hi-Point Firearms]] which include models chambered in [[.45 ACP]], [[.40 S&W]], [[.380 ACP]] and [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hi-pointfirearms.com/handguns/hi_point_handguns.html |title=Hi-Point Firearms: Handguns |work=Hi-Point Firearms |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711165408/http://www.hi-pointfirearms.com/handguns/hi_point_handguns.html |archivedate=2011-07-11 }}</ref> Simple blowback operation can also be found in small-bore (such as [[.22 Long Rifle|.22LR]]) semi-automatic [[rifle]]s, [[carbine]]s and [[submachine gun]]s.

The bolt can be made bigger and more massive in these weapons than in handguns, as they are intrinsically heavier and designed, ideally at least, to be fired with both hands, often with the aid of a shoulder stock; and these factors help to ameliorate the disruption to the shooter's aim caused by the heavy bolt's movement. Consequently, simple blowback is adequate for somewhat more powerful rounds in submachine guns than in standard pistols. There were also a few rifles that chambered cartridges specifically designed for blowback operation. Examples include the [[Winchester Model 1905]], [[Winchester Model 1907|1907]] and [[Winchester Model 1910|1910]]. The only known assault rifle to use simple blowback was the Burton Model 1917.<ref>The World's Assault Rifles By Gary Paul Johnston, Thomas B. Nelson. Chapter 2: Assault Rifle Operating and Locking Systems.</ref>\n\nWhereas simple blowback is limited to guns using low-power rounds, it is so efficient in this context that in small-calibre [[semi-automatic pistols]] it is by now almost ubiquitous.  Heavier calibre semiautomatic handguns typically employ a [[Recoil operation|short recoil system]], of which by far the most common type are [[John Browning#Products|Browning]]-derived designs which rely on a locking barrel and [[Pistol slide|slide]] assembly instead of blowback. But blowback guns can be used to fire powerful cartridges if they are of the other two types already mentioned: API or delayed blowback.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Advanced primer ignition (API) blowback==\n{{stack\n | [[File:MK108 bolt cycle AB.png|thumb|right|[[MK 108 cannon]] bolt cycle (part I)]]\n | [[File:MK108 bolt cycle CD.png|thumb|right|[[MK 108 cannon]] bolt cycle (part II)]]\n}}\nIn the API blowback design, the primer is ignited when the bolt is still moving forward and before the cartridge is fully chambered. This requires a very careful design to ensure the proper balance and equalization of forces between the projectile weight, propellant charge, barrel length, bolt weight, and return spring strength. In a simple blowback design, the propellant gases have to overcome static [[inertia]] to accelerate the bolt rearwards to open the breech. In an API blowback, they first have to do the work of overcoming forward [[momentum]] to arrest the forward motion of the bolt. Because the forward and rearward speeds of the bolt tend to be approximately the same, the API blowback allows the weight of the bolt to be halved.<ref name=\"Chinn_31\">{{harvnb|Chinn|1955|p=31}}</ref> Because the momentum of the two opposed bolt motions cancels out over time, the API blowback design results in reduced recoil.\n\nAccording to Anthony G. Williams, the \"API blowback principle is used virtually in all [[open bolt]] [[sub-machine gun]]s\" (technically, although generally these are known as \"simple blowback\" weapons due to the very late ignition of the cartridge compared to specially designed API blowback guns like the MK 108), although \"the relatively low pressures and velocities mean that extended chambers and [[rebated-rim cartridge]]s are not required\" for sub-machine guns.<ref name=\"Williams_65\">Anthony G. Williams, ''Rapid Fire'', Airlife UK 2000, page 65</ref> In heavier weapons, advanced primer ignition (API) was originally developed by Reinhold Becker<ref>[http://www.quarryhs.co.uk/apib.html Williams, Anthony G., ''Of Oerlikons and other things\u2026\u2026''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110002552/http://www.quarryhs.co.uk/apib.html |date=2014-11-10 }} www.quarry.nildram.co.uk article</ref> for use on the [[Becker Type M2 20 mm cannon]]. It became a feature of a wide range of designs that can be traced back to Becker's, including the [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon]] cannon widely used as anti-aircraft weapons during World War II.<ref name=\"Williams_65\"/>\n\nTo increase performance of API blowback firearms,<ref name=\"Chinn_31\"/> larger calibre APIB guns such as the Becker and Oerlikon use extended chambers, longer than is necessary to contain the round, and ammunition for APIB firearms come with straight-sided cartridges with [[Rim (firearms)#Rebated rim|rebated rims]] (rims that are smaller in diameter than the cartridge itself).<ref name=\"Williams_63\">Anthony G. Williams, ''Rapid Fire'', Airlife UK 2000, pages 63-68</ref> The last part of forward motion and the first part of the rearward motion of the case and bolt happen within the confines of this extended chamber. As long as the gas pressure in the barrel is high, the walls of the case remain supported and the breach sealed, although the case is sliding rearwards. This sliding motion of the case, while it is expanded by a high internal gas pressure, risks tearing it apart, and a common solution is to grease the ammunition to reduce the friction. The case needs to have a rebated rim because the front end of the bolt will enter the chamber, and the extractor claw hooked over the rim therefore has to fit also within the diameter of the chamber. The case generally has very little neck, because this remains unsupported during the firing cycle and is generally deformed; a strongly necked case would be likely to split.\n\nThe API blowback design permits the use of more powerful ammunition in a lighter gun than would be achieved by using simple blowback, and the reduction of felt recoil results in further weight savings. The original Becker cannon, firing 20\u00d770mmRB ammunition, was developed to be carried by World War I aircraft, and weighed only 30&nbsp;kg.<ref name=\"Williams_89\">Anthony G. Williams, ''Flying Gun World War I'', Airlife UK 2003, pages 89-90</ref> Oerlikon even produced an anti-tank rifle firing 20\u00d7110mmRB ammunition using the API blowback operation, the [[Oerlikon SSG36|SSG36]]. On the other hand, because the design imposes a very close relationship between bolt mass, chamber length, spring strength, ammunition power and rate of fire, in APIB guns high rate of fire and high muzzle velocity tend to be mutually exclusive.<ref name=\"Williams_63\"/> API blowback guns also have to fire from an open bolt, which is not conducive to accuracy and also prevents [[synchronization gear|synchronized]] fire through an aircraft propeller arc.\n\nAccording to a [[United States Army Materiel Command]] engineering course from 1970, \"The advanced primer ignition gun is superior to the simple blowback because of its higher firing rate and lower recoil momentum. However, favorable performance depends on timing that must be precise. A slight delay in primer function, and the gun reverts to a simple blowback without the benefit of a massive bolt and stiffer driving spring to soften the recoil impact. [...] The exacting requirements in design and construction of gun and ammunition reduce this type almost to the point of academic interest only.\"<ref>[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=AD0868578 Automatic Weapons] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801182437/http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=AD0868578 |date=2013-08-01 }}, [[United States Army Materiel Command|AMC]] pamphlet no. 706-260, February 1970, page 2{{hyphen}}47<!-- this not a page range, but a single page number --></ref>\n\nAPI mechanisms are very sensitive to the ammunition used. For example, when the Germans switched their [[MG FF]] (an Oerlikon FFF derivative) to their new, lighter [[Minengescho\u00df]] shell, they had to rebalance the spring strength and bolt weight of the gun, resulting in a new MG FF/M model with ammunition not being interchangeable between the two models.<ref name=\"Williams_166\">Anthony G. Williams, ''Rapid Fire'', Airlife UK 2000, pages 65 and 166</ref> The 30&nbsp;mm [[MK 108 cannon]] was perhaps the apogee of API blowback technology during World War II.\n\nAn example of API in sub-machine guns is the L2A3 [[Sterling submachine gun]], where the maximum chamber pressure is achieved while the breechblock is still moving forward and is about 0.46&nbsp;mm away from the rear face of the chamber.<ref name=\"Cutshaw2011\">{{cite book|author=Charles Q.

As with the resistance provided by momentum in API, it takes a fraction of a second for the propellant gases to overcome this and start moving cartridge and bolt backwards; this very brief delay is sufficient for the bullet to leave the muzzle and for the internal pressure in the barrel to decrease to a safe level.  The bolt and cartridge are then pushed to the rear by the residual gas pressure.   \n\nBecause of high pressures, rifle-caliber delayed blowback firearms, such as the [[FAMAS]] and [[Heckler & Koch G3|G3]], typically have fluted chambers to ease extraction. Below are various forms of delayed-blowback actions:\n\n===Roller-delayed===\n[[File:Roller delayed blowback action.svg|thumb|right|Roller-delayed blowback-operated breech for automatic weapons]]\n[[File:G3 Bolt.PNG|thumb|upright|A schematic of the G3 roller-delayed blowback mechanism]]\n[[File:DCB Shooting G3 Roller system3.JPG|thumb|upright|Cutaway model of the chamber with gas relief flutes (left) and roller-delayed action of the G3 assault rifle]]\n[[File:US Patent 3283435 8-Nov-1966 BREECH CLOSURE Theodor Koch.png|thumb|right|A schematic of the roller-delayed blowback mechanism used in the [[Heckler & Koch MP5|MP5]] [[submachine gun]]. This system had its origins in the late-war [[StG 45(M)]] [[assault rifle]] prototype.]]\n\nRoller-delayed blowback was first used in [[Mauser]]'s [[StG 45(M)|Ger\u00e4t 06H]] prototype. Roller-delayed blowback operation differs from [[Roller locked|roller-locked]] [[recoil operation]] as seen in the [[MG 42]] and gas operated roller locked, as seen in the Ger\u00e4t 06.<ref>{{Citation|last=Forgotten Weapons|title=Last Ditch Innovation: The Development of the Gerat 06 and Gerat 06H Rifles|date=2012-11-19|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WEPwmYcCPFs|accessdate=2017-11-30}}</ref> Unlike the MG 42, in roller-delayed blowback the barrel is fixed and does not recoil, and unlike the StG 44, roller-delayed blowback systems lack a gas piston. These omissions are conducive to relatively light construction by significantly reducing the number of parts required and the amount of machining required to reduce a rifle. As the bolt head is driven rearward, rollers on the sides of the bolt are driven inward against a tapered bolt carrier extension. This forces the bolt carrier rearward at a much greater velocity and delays movement of the bolt head. The primary advantage of roller-delayed blowback is the simplicity of the design compared to gas or recoil operation.<ref>Stevens, R. Blake, ''Full Circle: A Treatise on Roller Locking'', Collector Grade Publications (2006). {{ISBN|0-88935-400-6}}.</ref>\n\nThe roller-delayed blowback firearm action was patented by Mausers Wilhelm St\u00e4hle and [[Ludwig Vorgrimler]]. Though appearing simple its development during World War II was a hard technical and personal effort, as German engineering, mathematical and other scientists had to work together on a like-it-or-not basis led by [[Ott-Helmuth von Lossnitzer]], the director of [[Mauser|Mauser Werke's]] Weapons Research Institute and Weapons Development Group. Experiments showed roller-delayed blowback firearms exhibited bolt-bounce as the bolt opened at an extreme velocity of approximately {{convert|20|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}} during automatic fire. To counter bolt-bounce the perfect angle choice on the nose of the bolt head had to be found to significantly reduce the opening velocity of the bolt. The extremely high bolt carrier velocities problem was not solved by trial and error. Mathematician Dr. Karl Maier provided analysis of the components, assemblies in the development project.<ref>[https://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2013/01/01/do-you-know-your-hks-parents/ Do You Know Your HK\u2019s Parents?]</ref> In December 1943 Maier came up with an equation that engineers used to change the angles in the receiver to 45\u00b0 and 27\u00b0 on the locking piece relative to the longitudinal axis reducing the bolt-bounce problem. With these angles the geometrical transmission ratio of the bolt carrier to the bolthead became 3:1, so the rear bolt carrier was forced to move 3 times faster than the bolthead. The rearward forces on the bolt carrier and receiver were 2:1. The force and impulse transmitted to the receiver increases with the force and impulse transmitted to the bolt carrier. Making the bolt carrier heavier lessens the recoil velocity. For Mausers [[StG 45(M)]] project Maier assumed a {{convert|120|g|oz|1|abbr=on}} bolt head and {{convert|360|g|oz|1|abbr=on}} bolt carrier (1 to 3 ratio). The prototype StG 45 (M) assault rifle had 18 longitudinal gas relief flutes cut in the [[Chamber (firearms)|chamber]] wall to assist the bloated cartridge casing from the chamber walls during extraction. Fluting the end of the chamber provides pressure equalization between the front outer surface of the cartridge case and its interior and thus ensures extraction without tearing the case making extraction easier and more reliable. In 1944 other German companies like Gro\u00dffu\u00df, Rheinmetall and Haenel showed interest in developing roller-delayed blowback small arms. Gro\u00dffu\u00df worked on a roller-delayed blowback [[MG 45]] general-purpose machine gun that, like the StG 45 (M), had not progressed beyond the prototype stage by the end of World War II.\n\nAfter World War II, former Mauser technicians Ludwig Vorgrimler and Theodor L\u00f6ffler perfected the mechanism between 1946 and 1950 while working for the French small arms manufacturer [[Atelier M\u00e9canique de Mulhouse|Centre d'Etudes et d'Armament de Mulhouse]] (CEAM). In 1950 Ludwig Vorgrimler was recruited to work for [[CETME]] in Spain. The first full-scale production rifle to utilize roller-delay was the Spanish [[CETME rifle|CETME battle rifle]], which was closely followed by the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[SIG SG 510]] and the CETME Model B-based [[Heckler & Koch G3]]. The G3 bolt features an anti-bounce mechanism that prevents the bolt from bouncing off the barrel's breech surface.<ref name=\"wo\u017aniak\">Wo\u017aniak, Ryszard. Encyklopedia najnowszej broni palnej \u2013 tom 2 G-\u0141. Bellona. 2001. pp. 7\u201310.</ref> The G3's \"bolt head locking lever\" is a spring-loaded claw mounted on the bolt carrier that grabs the bolt head as the bolt carrier group goes into battery. The lever essentially ratchets into place with friction, providing enough resistance to being re-opened that the bolt carrier does not rebound. Due to the relative low [[bolt thrust]] exhibited by pistol cartridges the anti-bounce mechanism is omitted by Heckler & Koch on their roller-delayed blowback firearms chambered for pistols cartridges. Heckler & Koch's [[Heckler & Koch MP5|MP5]] [[submachine gun]] is the most common weapon still in service worldwide using this system. The [[Heckler & Koch P9]] semi-automatic pistol, [[CETME Ameli]] light machine gun and [[Heckler & Koch HK21]] general-purpose machine gun also use it.\n\nRoller-delayed blowback arms are ammunition specific, since they lack an adjustable gas port or valve to adjust the arm to various propellant and projectile specific pressure behavior. Their reliable functioning is limited by specific ammunition and arm parameters like bullet weight, propellant charge, barrel length and amount of wear. At the moment of cartridge ignition the chamber has to be and remain sealed, until the bullet has exited the barrel and the gas pressure within the bore has dropped to a safe level before the seal is broken and chamber starts to open. For obtaining a proper and safe functioning parameters bandwith arms manufactures offer a variety of locking pieces with different mass and shoulder angles and cylindrical rollers with different diameters. The angles are critical and determine the unlock timing and gas pressure drop management as the locking piece acts in unison with the bolt head carrier. The bolt gap width determines the [[Headspace (firearms)|headspace]] and hence the correct positioning of the cartridges in the (closed) chamber. Do to usage wear the bolt gap between the locking piece and bolt head carrier is expected to gradully increase. It can be determined and checked by a [[feeler gauge]] measurement and can be altered by changing the cylindrical rollers for rollers with a different diameter. Installing larger diameter rollers will increase the bolt gap and push the locking piece forward. Installing smaller diameter rollers results in the reverse effects.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd8FrUe8fMM How Does It Work: Roller Delayed Blowback]</ref><ref>[http://firearmshistory.blogspot.com/2010/08/actions-blowback-action-roller-delayed.html Actions: Blowback Action: Roller Delayed Blowback ]</ref><ref>[https://www.internationalsportsman.com/how-roller-delayed-firearms-work-and-why-it-matters/ How Roller-Delayed Firearms Work and Why it Matters]</ref>\n\n===Lever-delayed===\n[[File:FAMAS Bolt-gr.PNG|thumb|right|A schematic of the lever-delayed blowback mechanism used in the FAMAS assault rifle.]]\nLever-delayed blowback utilizes leverage to put the bolt at a mechanical disadvantage, delaying the opening of the breech. When the cartridge pushes against the bolt face, the lever moves the bolt carrier rearward at an accelerated rate relative to the light bolt. Leverage can be applied with a dedicated part or through inclined surfaces interacting with each other. This leverage significantly increases resistance and slows the movement of the lightweight bolt. [[John Pedersen (arms designer)|John Pedersen]] patented the first known design for a lever-delay system.<ref>{{US Patent|1410270}}</ref> The mechanism was adapted by [[Hungary|Hungarian]] arms designer [[P\u00e1l Kir\u00e1ly]] in the 1930s and used in the [[Danuvia 43M submachine gun|Danuvia 39M and 43M]] submachine guns for the [[Royal Hungarian Army|Hungarian Army]]. After the [[World War II]], Kir\u00e1ly settled in the [[Dominican Republic]] and developed the [[Crist\u00f3bal Carbine]]  (or Kir\u00e1ly-Crist\u00f3bal Carbine).

The [[Bolt (firearms)|bolt]] is never locked, and so is pushed rearward by the expanding [[propellant]] gases, as in other blowback-based designs. However, propellant gases are vented from the barrel into a cylinder with a piston that delays the opening of the bolt. It was used by some World War II German designs for the [[7.92\u00d733mm Kurz]] cartridge, including the [[Volkssturmgewehr]] rifle (with little effectiveness) and the [[Grossfuss Sturmgewehr]] (with slightly more efficiency),<ref name=\"kalash\">{{citation |first=\u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439 |last=\u041f\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0440\u0451\u0432 |url=http://www.kalashnikov.ru/upload/medialibrary/44a/020_026.pdf |script-title=ru:\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f: \u043c\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u044b: \u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442 \u0425\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0430 |trans-title=History: a little-known weapon of World War II: Horn Assault Rifle |language=Russian |journal=\u041a\u0410\u041b\u0410\u0428\u041d\u0418\u041a\u041e\u0412. \u041e\u0420\u0423\u0416\u0418\u0415, \u0411\u041e\u0415\u041f\u0420\u0418\u041f\u0410\u0421\u042b, \u0421\u041d\u0410\u0420\u042f\u0416\u0415\u041d\u0418\u0415 (Kalasnikov: Weapons, ammunition, equipment) |date=September 2006 |pages=20\u201326 |access-date=2013-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408222103/http://www.kalashnikov.ru/upload/medialibrary/44a/020_026.pdf |archive-date=2014-04-08 |url-status=live }}</ref> and after the war by the [[Heckler & Koch P7]], [[Walther CCP]], [[Steyr GB]] and [[Type 77 pistol#M-77B|M-77B]] pistols.\n\n===Chamber-ring delayed===\nWhen a cartridge is fired, the case expands to seal the sides of the chamber. This seal prevents high-pressure gas from escaping into the action of the gun. Because a conventional chamber is slightly oversized, an unfired cartridge will enter freely. In a chamber-ring delayed firearm, the chamber is conventional in every respect except for a concave ring within the chamber wall. When the cartridge is fired, the case expands into this recessed ring and pushes the bolt face rearward. As the case moves to the rear this ring constricts the expanded portion of the case. The energy required to squeeze the walls of the cartridge case slows the rearward travel of the case and slide, reducing their mass requirements. The first known use of the system was on the Fritz Mann pistol in 1920 and later on the High Standard Corp model T3 experimental pistol developed by Ott-Helmuth von Lossnitzer while working for High Standard.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.forgottenweapons.com/high-standard-t3-prototype-an-american-blowback-at-james-d-julia/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-04-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170414081723/http://www.forgottenweapons.com/high-standard-t3-prototype-an-american-blowback-at-james-d-julia/ |archive-date=2017-04-14 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://unblinkingeye.com/Guns/Mann/mann.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330143534/https://unblinkingeye.com/Guns/Mann/mann.html |archive-date=2018-03-30 |url-status=live }}</ref>  Other firearms that used this system were the LWS [[Seecamp]] pistol, the AMT Automag II, and the Kimball .30 Carbine pistol.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.seecamp.com/caremaintenance.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-02-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228090142/http://www.seecamp.com/caremaintenance.htm |archive-date=2017-02-28 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://modernfirearms.net/en/handguns/handguns-en/u-s-a-semi-automatic-pistols/amt-automag-ii-v-eng/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313214242/http://modernfirearms.net/en/handguns/handguns-en/u-s-a-semi-automatic-pistols/amt-automag-ii-v-eng/ |archive-date=2018-03-13 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.forgottenweapons.com/detroits-short-lived-kimball-30-carbine-pistol/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330143444/https://www.forgottenweapons.com/detroits-short-lived-kimball-30-carbine-pistol/ |archive-date=2018-03-30 |url-status=live }}</ref>  The [[SIG SG 510]] rifle family incorporates a chamber ring near the shoulder which is used to avoid bolt-bounce rather than a delay element.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.biggerhammer.net/sigamt/iar/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-02-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404152628/http://www.biggerhammer.net/sigamt/iar/ |archive-date=2017-04-04 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Hesitation locked===\n[[John Pedersen (arms designer)|John Pedersen]]'s patented system incorporates a breech block independent of the slide or bolt carrier. When in battery, the breech block rests slightly forward of the locking shoulder located in the frame of the firearm. When the cartridge is fired, the cartridge case, bolt and slide move together a short distance until the breech block strikes the locking shoulder and stops. The slide continues rearward with the momentum it acquired in the initial phase while the breech remains locked. This allows chamber pressure to drop to safe levels once the bullet departs the barrel. The continuing motion of the slide lifts the breech block from its recess and pulls it rearward, continuing the firing cycle.

The French [[MAS-38]] submachine gun of 1938 utilizes a bolt whose path of recoil is at an angle to the barrel. The [[Jatimatic]] and [[KRISS Vector]] use modified versions of this concept.\n\n===Radial-delayed===\nCMMG introduced the [[CMMG Mk 45 Guard|Mk 45 Guard rifle]] incorporating a radial-delay in 2017. This system uses the [[Rotating bolt|rotation]] of the bolt head to accelerate the bolt carrier of an [[Colt AR-15|AR-15]] pattern rifle. The bolt locking lugs are adapted to incorporate 120\u00b0 angles that rotate the bolt as it travels rearward under conventional blowback power. As the bolt rotates 22.5\u02da, it must accelerate the bolt carrier to the rear through an adapted 50\u00b0 angle cam-pin slot. This acceleration amplifies the effective mass of the bolt carrier, slowing the speed of the bolt head.<ref>[https://patents.google.com/patent/US20180142972A1/ Radial delayed blowback operating system, such as for ar 15 platform US20180142972A1]</ref> This delay allows pressure to drop prior to extraction without the penalty of a heavier bolt carrier assembly.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.shootingillustrated.com/articles/2017/4/25/cmmg-introduces-mkg45-guard-pistol-caliber-carbine/ |title=CMMG Mk45 |access-date=2018-10-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181008061600/https://www.shootingillustrated.com/articles/2017/4/25/cmmg-introduces-mkg45-guard-pistol-caliber-carbine/ |archive-date=2018-10-08 |url-status=live }}</ref> The system is similar to roller and lever-delayed blowback in that it uses the mass of the bolt carrier moving at a faster rate than the bolt head to delay the action from opening.

This weapon was ultimately not selected for production.\n\n==Other blowback systems==\n===Floating chamber===\n[[David Marshall Williams]] (a noted designer for the U.S. Ordnance Office and later [[Winchester Repeating Arms Company|Winchester]]) developed a mechanism to allow firearms designed for full-sized cartridges to fire .22 caliber rimfire ammunition reliably. His system used a small \"piston\" that incorporates the chamber.  When the cartridge is fired, the front of the floating chamber is thrust back by gas pressure impinging on the front of the chamber as in a traditional piston.  This, added to the blowback energy imparted on the cartridge, pushes the bolt back with greater energy than either force alone.  Often described as \"accelerated blowback\", this amplifies the otherwise anemic recoil energy of the .22 Rimfire cartridge.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQY/is_3_50/ai_112646118 |title=Charles E.

Known prototypes using this method of operation include two 1936 rifle designs, one by Mihail Mamontov and another by Makar Goryainov at [[TsKB-14]], and [[Baryshev AVB-7.62|a 1980s design by A.F. Barishev]]. The Mamontov and Goryainov rifles are only partially automatic; only the bolt unlocking is powered by the gases pushing the cartridge back, while the rest of the cycle (ejection, reloading) is done manually as in a traditional bolt-action rifle. A major problem with using the case cartridge as piston is that its motion is much faster (about 1 ms) compared to tapping gas further down the bore through a piston\u2014about 5 ms in the [[Dragunov sniper rifle]], which used the same cartridge as Mamontov's rifle. Barishev made a fully automatic, but rather bulky mechanism that used a mechanical delay. In his system, the case cartridge pushed back a tilting bolt face, that upon reaching a certain angle pushes backwards an unlocking lever that continues farther before unlocking the bolt. The [[GRAU]] however still gave a negative evaluation of Barishev's gun, pointing out that the main problems with reliability of firearms using the cartridge case as a piston were known since the 1930s and still unsolved.<ref>\u0420. \u0427\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043a, [http://www.kalashnikov.ru/upload/medialibrary/03f/gilzovyi-dvigatel.pdf \u0413\u0418\u041b\u042c\u0417\u041e\u0412\u042b\u0419 \u0414\u0412\u0418\u0413\u0410\u0422\u0415\u041b\u042c. \u041e \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430\u0445 \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513011523/http://www.kalashnikov.ru/upload/medialibrary/03f/gilzovyi-dvigatel.pdf |date=May 13, 2014 }}, ''Kalashnikov'' magazine 2012/11, pp. 72-77</ref>\n\n==Limited-utility designs==\n===Blish lock===\n{{main article|Blish lock}}\nThe Blish Lock is a breech locking mechanism designed by John Bell Blish based upon his observation that under extreme pressures, certain dissimilar metals will resist movement with a force greater than normal friction laws would predict. In modern engineering terminology, it is called static friction, or ''[[stiction]]''. His locking mechanism was used in the [[Thompson submachine gun]], [[Thompson Autorifle|Autorifle]] and [[Thompson Light Rifle|Autocarbine]] designs. This dubious principle was later eliminated as redundant in the M1 and M1A1 versions of the submachine guns at the insistence of the US Army.<ref>Soviet Submachine Guns Of World War II. Chris McNab, Osprey Publishing,2014.</ref> Lubrication or fouling would completely defeat any delay. Whatever actual advantage a clean, unlubricated Blish system could impart could also be attained by adding a mere ounce of mass to the bolt.<ref>Army Ordnance, December 1920</ref>\n\n===Savage rotating barrel===\nThe Savage system employed the theory that the rifling in the barrel caused a rotational force that would hold the gun locked until the projectile left the barrel.  It was later discovered that the bullet had left the barrel long before any locking could occur. Savage pistols were in fact operating as simple blow back firearms.<ref>{{citation |last=Hatcher |first=Julian |title=Hatchers Notebook |publisher=The Military Service Press Company |year=1947 |pages=259\u2013261 |isbn=0-8117-0795-4}}</ref>  The French [[MAB PA-15 pistol|MAB PA-15]] and PA-8 9mm pistols feature a similar design.\n\n==Other autoloading systems==\nOther autoloading systems are:\n* [[Blow forward]] where the barrel is the only moving component of the weapon that is dragged forward by the friction of the bullet until it leaves the barrel.\n* [[Recoil operation]] uses the rearward movement of parts of the weapon counter to the ejecta (bullet and propellant) moving forward, as described by [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's third law|Newton's third law of motion]].\n* [[Gas-operated reloading]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of blow forward firearms]]\n* [[List of delayed-blowback firearms]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Bremner, Derek, ''The MG42V and the Origins of Delayed Blowback Roller Lock: WWII German Equipment'' (Paperback). {{ISBN|0-9533792-0-5}}.\n*{{cite book| last = Chinn| first = George M.| authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1955| chapter =| title = The Machine Gun, Volume IV: Design Analysis of Automatic Firing Mechanisms and Related Components| publisher = Bureau of Ordnance, Department of the Navy| location = Washington, D.C.| isbn = |ref=harv}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Blowback operation}}\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXVPUxqbgII How Does it Work: Blowback Action] Forgotten Weapons\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbIV9-kyphY How Does it Work: Gas-Delayed Blowback] Forgotten Weapons\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utv6LK6CxJI How Does It Work: Lever Delayed Blowback] Forgotten Weapons\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd8FrUe8fMM How Does It Work: Roller Delayed Blowback] Forgotten Weapons\n\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080724175150/http://www.smallarmsreview.com/pdf/TZ45.pdf Information about the TZ45 submachine gun and the concept of advanced primer ignition]\n*[http://science.howstuffworks.com/machine-gun6.htm Blowback action], Animation and explanation at howstuffworks.com\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070302035403/http://www.hecklerkoch-usa.com/index.jsp?loc=231&SITEID=B&PartNumber=MP51 Heckler and Koch USA now uses the \"roller-delayed blowback\" terminology]\n*[https://archive.is/20130105175139/http://www.wikipatents.com/4061075.html Blow-Forward operated submachine gun patent]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110831010932/http://www.wikipatents.com/5123329.html Blow-Forward firearm patent]\n*[http://www.google.com/patents/US1472126 Kewish primer actuated patent (1/4 assigned to Garand)]\n*[http://www.google.com.ar/patents/US1603684 US1603684] Garand patent making reference to earlier primer actuated application in 1919.\n*[http://www.leagle.com/decision/194689467FSupp827_1752.xml/BURKE%20v.%20UNITED%20STATES ''Burke v US'', 67 F.Supp 827 (1947)] has comment about [[John T.

He began coaching in youth football for various Victorian clubs, before his first managerial role with [[Caroline Springs George Cross FC|Sunshine George Cross]], and then later, [[Hume City FC|Coburg United]]. His first job abroad came in 2013, spending four months as the inaugural manager of Papua New Guinean side [[F.C. Port Moresby|Port Moresby]]. From 2014 to 2017, he managed the women's sides of [[Melbourne Victory FC|Melbourne Victory]] and [[Melbourne City FC|Melbourne City]], and then replaced [[Pedro Mart\u00ednez Losa]] as manager of Arsenal, where he won the [[2018\u201319 FA WSL|league title]] in his second season with the club.\n\n== Career ==\n\n===Playing career===\nMontemurro spent his entire junior playing career at [[Brunswick Zebras FC|Brunswick Juventus]] and made his first senior appearance for the club in 1986 in the [[National Soccer League (Australia)|National Soccer League]] as a 16-year-old. He was also a member of the Victorian State Youth team between 1986\u201388 which won two national titles.\n \nIn 1987, he was offered a scholarship at the [[Australian Institute of Sport]] which he declined to remain at Brunswick Juventus. In 1988, he was spotted by Swiss club [[Neuch\u00e2tel Xamax|Neuchatel Xamax]] and offered the opportunity to remain in Europe. From there he passed onto Italian [[Serie C2]] club [[Potenza S.C.|Potenza]] before spending the bulk of his career at [[A.C.D. Treviso|Treviso]] in Serie C2.\n\nHe returned to Australia in 1996 and resumed playing in the Victorian State leagues while embarking on his coaching education.\n\n===Managerial career===\n====Early years coaching in Victoria====\nHis first coaching positions commenced at his former junior club Brunswick Juventus. His first major role was as youth coach (U21) in the Victorian Premier league with [[Green Gully SC|Green Gully]] in which he took the team to the runner-up position in his first year.\n\nIn the 2002\u201303 season Montemurro took over the youth team at [[Melbourne Knights FC|Melbourne Knights]] in the National Soccer League, in which he guided the team to a Southern Division Championship. The team lost the playoff to become National Youth Champions. The demise of the National League came and the club offered Montemurro the senior position in the Victorian Premier League. He opted to continue his youth coaching at cross town rivals [[South Melbourne FC|South Melbourne]] in which he guided the team to the runner-up position in 2005.\n\nMid 2006, with the team sitting clear at the top of the ladder, Montemurro was approached by [[Caroline Springs George Cross FC|Sunshine George Cross]] to take over the first team and save it from relegation. He succeeded and continued his position until mid 2007, when he parted ways with the club. His next role was head coach of [[Hume City FC|Coburg United]] in Victorian State League 1 in which he guided the club to its first ever promotion to top flight football in the club's 30-year history.\n\nIn 2010, he returned to South Melbourne as a youth coach and guided the team to a historic undefeated season as champions.

He began coaching in youth football for various Victorian clubs, before his first managerial role with [[Caroline Springs George Cross FC|Sunshine George Cross]], and then later, [[Hume City FC|Coburg United]]. His first job abroad came in 2013, spending four months as the inaugural manager of Papua New Guinean side [[F.C. Port Moresby|Port Moresby]]. From 2014 to 2017, he managed the women's sides of [[Melbourne Victory FC|Melbourne Victory]] and [[Melbourne City FC|Melbourne City]], and then replaced [[Pedro Mart\u00ednez Losa]] as manager of Arsenal, where he won the [[2018\u201319 FA WSL|league title]] in his second season with the club.\n\n== Career ==\n\n===Playing career===\nMontemurro spent his entire junior playing career at [[Brunswick Zebras FC|Brunswick Juventus]] and made his first senior appearance for the club in 1986 in the [[National Soccer League (Australia)|National Soccer League]] as a 16-year-old. He was also a member of the Victorian State Youth team between 1986\u201388 which won two national titles.\n \nIn 1987, he was offered a scholarship at the [[Australian Institute of Sport]] which he declined to remain at Brunswick Juventus. In 1988, he was spotted by Swiss club [[Neuch\u00e2tel Xamax|Neuchatel Xamax]] and offered the opportunity to remain in Europe. From there he passed onto Italian [[Serie C2]] club [[Potenza S.C.|Potenza]] before spending the bulk of his career at [[A.C.D. Treviso|Treviso]] in Serie C2.\n\nHe returned to Australia in 1996 and resumed playing in the Victorian State leagues while embarking on his coaching education.\n\n===Managerial career===\n====Early years coaching in Victoria====\nHis first coaching positions commenced at his former junior club Brunswick Juventus. His first major role was as youth coach (U21) in the Victorian Premier league with [[Green Gully SC|Green Gully]] in which he took the team to the runner-up position in his first year.\n\nIn the 2002\u201303 season Montemurro took over the youth team at [[Melbourne Knights FC|Melbourne Knights]] in the National Soccer League, in which he guided the team to a Southern Division Championship. The team lost the playoff to become National Youth Champions. The demise of the National League came and the club offered Montemurro the senior position in the Victorian Premier League. He opted to continue his youth coaching at cross town rivals [[South Melbourne FC|South Melbourne]] in which he guided the team to the runner-up position in 2005.\n\nMid 2006, with the team sitting clear at the top of the ladder, Montemurro was approached by [[Caroline Springs George Cross FC|Sunshine George Cross]] to take over the first team and save it from relegation. He succeeded and continued his position until mid 2007, when he parted ways with the club. His next role was head coach of [[Hume City FC|Coburg United]] in Victorian State League 1 in which he guided the club to its first ever promotion to top flight football in the club's 30-year history.\n\nIn 2010, he returned to South Melbourne as a youth coach and guided the team to a historic undefeated season as champions. He was promoted to assistant senior coach at South, in which VPL finals appearances and the quarter finals of the Singapore Cup were achievements during his tenure. During 2013, he took over new franchise club [[F.C. Port Moresby|Port Moresby]] in the [[Papua New Guinea National Soccer League]]. The club finished third in the league, qualifying for the championship playoffs, where they reached the final, only to lose 3\u20130 to [[Hekari United]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thenational.com.pg/hekari-rule/|title=Hekari rule|work=The National|first=Henry|last=Morabang|date=3 June 2013|accessdate=9 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Melbourne Victory and Melbourne City====\nIn 2014, he returned to Melbourne and was appointed National Training Centre head coach for women's football in Victoria.

Subsequently, while the show launched the careers of many talented solo vocalists, there has been a lack of female ''girl groups'' in the Chinese speaking world. The biggest girl group in the early 2000s was [[S.H.E.]] and since then, there has arguably been a lack of well-known cohesive girl groups that have been as successful. The show aims to create a brand new \"It\" girl group that represents modern women and appeals to all genders for the new generation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.xuehua.us/2018/04/14/\u5371\u673a\u4e0e\u8f6c\u673a\u5e76\u5b58\uff0c\u817e\u8baf\u89c6\u9891\u643a\u300a\u521b\u9020101\u300b\u5165\u573a\u80fd\u5426/ |script-title=zh:\u5371\u673a\u4e0e\u8f6c\u673a\u5e76\u5b58\uff0c\u817e\u8baf\u89c6\u9891\u643a\u300a\u521b\u9020101\u300b\u5165\u573a\u80fd\u5426\u6253\u901a\u5076\u50cf\u4ea7\u4e1a\u94fe |website=xuehua.us |date=2018-04-14 |accessdate=2018-12-12 |language=zh-hans}}</ref> Unlike the MNET/CJ Ent. version, this spinoff has a number of different rules and challenges introduced beginning in episode 2. One such example is the inclusion of \u201cknock-out\u201d challengers who can take the place of a 101 member in the original \u201cauditions\u201d based on mentors discretion of the challengers\u2019 skills in comparison to the original trainees. In the first elimination, certain members who had highest votes could also choose to save a member who was up for elimination as a second chance \u201cintern.\u201d\n\n== Mentors ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; text-align:center;\"\n!Name\n!Age (then)\n!Age (now)\n!Role\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[Huang Zitao|Tao]]\n|25\n|26\n|Nation's Producer \n|ex-member of [[Exo (band)]]\n|-\n|[[Tiger Hu]]\n|34\n|36\n|Songwriting/Composition instructor\n|\n|-\n|[[Jason Zhang]]\n|35\n|37\n|rowspan=\"2\" |Vocal instructor\n|\n|-\n|[[Ella Chen]]\n|36\n|38\n|Member of [[S.H.E]]\n|-\n|[[Show Lo]]\n|38\n|40\n|rowspan=\"2\" |Dance instructor\n|\n|-\n|[[Wang Yibo]]\n|20\n|22\n|Member of [[UNIQ (band)|UNIQ]]\n|}\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n=== Episode 1 (April 21, 2018) ===\nThe audience is introduced to the Lady Bee trio who walks in to a dark studio wondering where to go. The lights suddenly turn on and 101 seats are shown. Similar to the Korean counterpart, contestants are introduced by label and choose where they want to sit from #1 to #101. Once every girl is seated, the studio darkens and [[Huang Zitao|Tao]] introduces the mentors with each of the mentors performing their own song. After the performances by the mentors have ended, contestants perform with their label mates or a pre-made group to be evaluated from grades A to F. During the episode, it is revealed that only 11 trainees are only to be sorted into the A group, once 11 girls are filled, another girl that has been given the A rank will have to take a girl's nominated seat, voluntarily if a girl in the top 11 chooses to downgrade to the B rank or through a battle. At the end of the episode, we see 11 spots filled yet Yamy is given an A rank. The mentors discuss heavily to choose whom to demote to B rank. They choose Qiang Dongyue and she  agrees to a battle with Yamy. Yamy wins the battle and Qiang Dongyue is reluctantly demoted to the B rank.\n\n=== Episode 2 (April 28, 2018) ===\nThe evaluations go on where former SNH48 member Ge Jiahui performs with her group and trainees continually get evaluated to their respective ranks. There is a twist after all 101 girls are graded when the mentors announce that girls who are not from idol companies will also be competing for a spot in the top 101. If any of them get above an F grade, they may take the spot of another girl in F grade, eliminating her from the competition. Gao Yingxi, Wu Qianying and Re Yina take Cindy, Dora and Zhao Ling's place on the show. Re Yina also receives an A grade and battles Li Ziting for her spot in A class. Re Yina wins. Sunnee questions the mentors on this decision and Tao responds saying Re Yina's style is more unique and Li Ziting went off key during the vocal part of the battle while Ye Rina did not. Tao reassures the trainees that if they felt they were placed in an incorrect grade if they work hard it will be seen.\nThe girls arrive at their dorms and all the trainees envy A class' rooms being pink and bigger than all the others and having its own couch. Yina and Sunnee are placed in the same room which causes some tension between them. \nDuring the first class, it is revealed that Abby left the competition overnight and one of the girls from the non-idol companies, Wang Ju, will be taking her place in C class. The F class girls walk into their small practice room and become emotional at seeing an easel with motivational writing on it in the middle of the room. All of them make a promise to move up. In A class, Re Yina has a hard time matching the tones of the vocal teacher and keeping up with the dance. Li Zixuan in B class gets called up to sing with Ella and begins to cry. Ella motivates her and gets her some sunglasses to cover her eyes to overcome her fear of singing in front of people. \nFor the first evaluation, it is revealed that the girls will come up five at a time and dance and sing the theme song in front of everyone. Yang Chaoyue performs poorly and cries afterwards due to embarrassment and stress. When Zhu Tiantian performs, she dances incorrectly and sings loudly and incorrectly, throwing off the other contestants dancing with her. This causes Gao Qiuzi to cry from the shock and stress. The other trainees accuse Zhu Tiantian of just wanting screen time and not caring if it affects other trainees in their individual interviews.\nWhen it comes to F class's turn to be re-graded, Show Luo surprises them by saying only one trainee has remained in F class and the rest have moved up. A class has their re-gradings read out in front of everyone. The biggest change is Re Yina going from A class to F class.\n\n=== Episode 3 (May 5, 2018) ===\nThe next mission is revealed to be a battle mission like the other 101 series. However, this time the 16 leaders and centres are already chosen and split into two types of eight each. Eight \"Skilled\" centres and eight \"Diligent\" centres. The \"Diligent\" centres are chosen from the eight girls who spent the most time practising while the eight \"Skilled\" centres are chosen by the mentors and restricted to A and B class. The rest of the girls choose whose team they want to be in by standing behind them. The battles are also not two teams performing the same songs, instead, the centres of each team pick the song they want from a list of 16 songs given to them. On the night of the performances, the mentors form two teams representing eight groups each. Show Luo and Zhang Jie's team consists of Liu Renyu (skilled), Wu Xuanyi (skilled), Kimberley (skilled), Meng Meiqi (skilled), Ju Lin (diligent), Lu Xiaocao (diligent), Zhang Xinjie (diligent) and Duan Aojuan's (diligent) groups. Ella and Hu Yanbin's team consists of Yamy (skilled), Sunnee (skilled), Li Ziting (skilled), Fu Jing (skilled), Zhu Tiantian (diligent), Qiang Dongyue (diligent), Jiang Yanxi (diligent) and Luo Yijia's (diligent) groups.\nThe mentors play black and white match to decide who will announce their first group first. Ella loses to Show Luo and chooses Yamy's group, Show Luo chooses Ju Lin's group. Yamy's group wins. Show Luo then picks Wu Xuanyi's group and Ella picks Sunnee's group, Sunnee's group wins. Show Luo then sends out Kimberley's group and Ella picks Li Ziting's group, Kimberley's group wins. Ella chooses Fu Jing's group and Show Luo chooses Meng Meiqi's group, Meng Meiqi's group wins. Ella chooses Zhu Tiantian's group and Show Lou chooses Liu Renyu's group, Liu Renyu's group wins. Ella choose Qiang Dongyue's group and Show Luo chooses Lu Xiaocao's group, Qiang Dongyue's group wins. Show Luo chooses Zhang Xinjie's group and Ella chooses Jiang Yanxi's group, Jiang Yanxi's group wins. Show Luo chooses Duan Aojuan's group and Ella chooses Luo Yijia's group, Duan Aojuan's group wins.\nThis leaves Ella and Show Luo's teams at four points each, the girl from the team with the most points who got the most votes is confirmed centre for the next mission, however, both teams are tied so the girl with the most points out of the eight winning teams wins the advantage. The advantage goes to Meng Meiqi.\n\n=== Episode 4 (May 13, 2018) ===\nThe girls walk into the room and figure out that only the top 55 will remain in the competition. The rankings are announced and it is revealed that their rank will determine their grade from that point on with ranks 55-41 becoming D class, ranks 40-26 becoming C class, ranks 25-12 becoming B class and ranks 11-1 becoming A class. Wu Xuanyi comes 1st and Yang Bing comes 55th. It is then revealed that the eight girls from the winning teams who gained the most votes in the public performances can each pick one member from their teams from the previous round who is not in the top 55 to avoid elimination and join the top 55 as a pending trainee. Tao explains that the pending trainees will not be able to make any choices in the next mission and the 3 pending trainees who get the most votes will stay in the competition. Meng Meiqi saves Jiang Shen (rank 59), Qiang Dongyue saves Luo Tianshu (rank 92), Duan Aojuan saves Liu Nian (rank 63), Sunnee's whole team entered the top 55 without being saved so Sunnee cannot save anyone, Zhao Yaoke saves Yang Han (rank 93), Yamy saves Wang Ju (rank 90), Kimberley saves Chen Yuyan (rank 82) and Yang Chaoyue saves Xu Shiyin (rank 75).\n\n=== Episode 5 (May 19, 2018) ===\nThe episode starts with the girls calling their families before the first elimination. The procedure for the second mission is revealed. There are six mentors that will hold three different classes; vocal (Ella and Zhang Jie), dance (Show Luo and Wang Yibo) and composition (Hu Yanbin and Lin Yoga). The girls will write down which class they want from most to least (1 being top pick, 3 being bottom pick). The mentors then look through the lists and pick which girls they want. If there are too many top picks for their class, they must choose which girls not to pick and if they do not have enough top picks they must choose some girls who did not pick that class as their top pick. There are 10 spots in composition, 19 spots in vocal and 31 spots in dance. The classes are then split into 12 groups; 2 in composition, 4 in vocal and 6 in dance. The team leaders for all 12 teams are picked from the highest ranked girls within that class. The leaders pick which girls they want to fill their team. The girls race for the song they want by relay, the boards with the song names are on a wall and they have to try and take the board they want. During the race for the dance team's songs, one of the girls falls and all the other girls keep running. This makes Tao very angry and he scolds the girls for many things including their actions during the elimination, talking during filming, not listening and not caring when the girl fell over. The dance teams are made to run again. All the teams then practice for their performance.\n\n=== Episode 6 (May 26, 2018) ===\nThe teams perform their stages with Meng Meiqi's group going first as she received the most votes on the last stage. It is noticed that there is a chair on the left-hand side of the stage, the chair is revealed to be for the overall popularity queen during the position battle stages. Meng Meiqi is the first popularity queen as her team goes first and she received the most votes within her team. It is explained that if another team's popularity queen receives more votes than her, they can dethrone her. It is also explained that the popularity queens in each team will also get to choose which group to perform next regardless of dethroning the current overall popularity queen or not. The team chosen to perform next is always chosen by the previous team's popularity queen. Meng Meiqi is dethroned by Li Ziting, Wu Xuanyi fails to dethrone Li Ziting which is a big shock, Liu Xiaoyu dethrones Li Ziting on the last performance and becomes the overall popularity queen. The seven pending trainees gather on stage for a voting round to see who will stay and who will be eliminated officially. Jiang Shen, Wang Ju and Liu Nian become normal trainees again.\n\n=== Episode 7 (June 2, 2018) ===\nThe episode starts with the girls lounging around in their dorms. They get an irregular announcement from Tao where he expresses his sorrow that the next time they meet, some of the girls will be leaving. He also announces and the staff have organised an activity for the girls and each dorm is given a set amount of money. The girls may go out and spend the money on decorations for their dorm room. The dorms will be judged and the winning dorm will win a surprise. The popularity award prize is a voucher to go out and watch a movie, the prize for the best design is a cute dollhouse of the dorm. Meng Meiqi, Yamy, Qiang Dongyue and Sunnee's team wins the best design award and Wang Qing, Gao Quizi, Xu Mengjie and Ma Xingyu's dorm wins the popularity award. The ranks are announced company by company with JC Universe Entertainment being announced first as they are the only group with all of their members currently in the competition. After the rankings, the top 36 girls have a special segment called \"Us, whom you did not know\" where the girls get to show off skills previously unknown to the public. Then Tao reveals the next mission which, like the other seasons, is the album missions. There are six songs. The centres are chosen by the fans from the girls who received the most votes for each song. The centres are:\n\nI Am That Kind Of Girl: Meng Meiqi\n\nShiny: Wu Xuanyi\n\nSomeone Else's Kid: Yamy\n\nLiving Up To Our Youth: Yang Chaoyue\n\nTears Of A Ferris Wheel: Zining\n\nAwesome: Lai Meiyun\n\nTao then announces that there will be six male idol seniors joining in the performances, one in each team. Each of them has left a secret message for the girls to try and guess who they are. The episode ends after the first secret message is played.\n\n=== Episode 8 (June 9, 2018) ===\nThe 36 girls are presented with 30 gifts on a table. Each of the 30 gifts somehow represents one of the six male idols that will join the teams.  Everyone except the centres can pick a gift. The male idols are already assigned to a group so the gift the trainee picks determines which group they will join. Before the girls pick their gifts, the secret messages from each idol are played. The idols, which songs they picked and their gifts are revealed and the teams are formed:\n\nI Am That Kind Of Girl (Xiao Zhan): Meng Meiqi, Wang Ting, Gao Qiuzi, Li Ziting, Liu Renyu and Xu Mengjie\n\nAwesome (Wei Daxun): Lai Meiyun, Luo Yitian, Duan Aojuan, Wang Mohan, Zhao Yaoke and Wang Ju\n\nShiny (Xiong Ziqi): Wu Xuanyi, Fan Wei, Su Ruiqi, Fu Jing, Gao Yingxi and Luo Yijia\n\nTears Of A Ferris Wheel (Hu Yitian): Zhang Zining, Wei Jin, Chen Yihan, Jiang Shen, Sunnee and Qiang Dongyue\n\nLiving Up To Our Youth (Mao Buyi): Yang Chaoyue, Qi Yandi, Chiao Manting, Lu Xiaoyu, Wu Qianying and Liu Danmeng\n\nSomeone Else's Kid (Wang Yibo): Li Zixuan, Lu Xiaocao, Angela Hui, Kimberley, Yamy and Wu Yingxiang\n\nThe group perform their songs and are then all invited back onstage so the fans can vote for their favourite team, the team that wins will receive a special coaching class from all of the mentors. I Am That Kind Of Girl wins the prize and Zining is crowned overall popularity queen.\n\n=== Episode 9 (June 16, 2018) ===\n\nIn this episode, the elimination instead, took place on a cruise unlike the past few rounds. From there, 14 of them were eliminated, leaving only 22 contestants who will be participating in the finals. The girls were then asked to choose between the songs \"Bye Bye Baby\" and \"Full Bloom\". The following is how they picked the respective songs:\n\nBye Bye Baby: Wang Ju, Wu Xuanyi, Yamy, Duan Aojuan Lai Meiyun, Gao Qiuzi, Sunnee, Fu Jing, Liu Renyu, Li Zixuan, Angela Hui.\n\nFull Bloom: Meng Meiqi, Li Ziting, Yang Chaoyue, Zi Ning, Gao Yingxi, Qi Yandi, Xu Mengjie, Wu Yingxiang, Qiang Dongyue, Chen Yihan.\n\n=== Episode 10 (June 23, 2018) ===\n\nThis episode begins with all 101 contestants dancing to the theme song \"Produce 101 Girls\" (Pick Me). The girls then performed either a \"vocal\" or \"dance\" performance individually and at the end of everyone's solo performance, performed as a group in their respective divisions. The episode thereafter cuts to the girls performing \"Against Odds\", followed by \"Full Bloom\" accordingly to their groups assigned in Episode 9. By the end of the episode, the rankings were announced and Meng Meiqi (with a vote count of 185,244,357), was crowned first place and center of the group, with Wu Xuanyi at second (with a vote count of 181,533,349). It was also revealed that the debuting group will be called \"Rocket Girls 101\". With that, the show ended with the newly formed group performing to their debut song \"Rocket Girls\".\n\n==Contestants==\n\n{{plainlist|\n*{{Color box|#FA8072|border=darkgray}} Left the

Filming began on March 21, 2018 and the show premiered on [[Tencent Video]] on April 21.<ref>{{cite new|title=Produce 101 China|url=http://www.hallyukstar.com/2018/01/31/tencent-making-produce-101-china/|website=Hallyu K Star|publisher=Hallyu K Star|accessdate=March 6, 2018|language=th}}</ref> The series is jointly produced by 7-D Vision and [[Tencent Pictures|Tencent Penguin Pictures]], under license from [[Mnet (TV channel)|Mnet]]'s owner [[CJ E&M]].<ref>{{cite new|title=Produce 101 China|url=http://teenage.com.sg/entertainment/produce-101-china/|website=Teenage|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}</ref> The show attracted more than 4.3 billion views on Tencent Video.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pandaily.com/produce-101-begins-a-wave-of-interest-in-chinese-idol-groups/|title=Produce 101 Begins a Wave of Interest in Chinese Idol Groups|last=|first=|date=2018-07-01|website=Pandaily|access-date=2019-04-23}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nSince the success of ''[[Super Girl (TV series)]] (2004-2006)'' in China, there has yet to have been a national show that has sparked as strong interest from audiences in the same manner. Subsequently, while the show launched the careers of many talented solo vocalists, there has been a lack of female ''girl groups'' in the Chinese speaking world. The biggest girl group in the early 2000s was [[S.H.E.]] and since then, there has arguably been a lack of well-known cohesive girl groups that have been as successful. The show aims to create a brand new \"It\" girl group that represents modern women and appeals to all genders for the new generation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.xuehua.us/2018/04/14/\u5371\u673a\u4e0e\u8f6c\u673a\u5e76\u5b58\uff0c\u817e\u8baf\u89c6\u9891\u643a\u300a\u521b\u9020101\u300b\u5165\u573a\u80fd\u5426/ |script-title=zh:\u5371\u673a\u4e0e\u8f6c\u673a\u5e76\u5b58\uff0c\u817e\u8baf\u89c6\u9891\u643a\u300a\u521b\u9020101\u300b\u5165\u573a\u80fd\u5426\u6253\u901a\u5076\u50cf\u4ea7\u4e1a\u94fe |website=xuehua.us |date=2018-04-14 |accessdate=2018-12-12 |language=zh-hans}}</ref> Unlike the MNET/CJ Ent. version, this spinoff has a number of different rules and challenges introduced beginning in episode 2. One such example is the inclusion of \u201cknock-out\u201d challengers who can take the place of a 101 member in the original \u201cauditions\u201d based on mentors discretion of the challengers\u2019 skills in comparison to the original trainees. In the first elimination, certain members who had highest votes could also choose to save a member who was up for elimination as a second chance \u201cintern.\u201d\n\n== Mentors ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; text-align:center;\"\n!Name\n!Age (then)\n!Age (now)\n!Role\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[Huang Zitao|Tao]]\n|25\n|26\n|Nation's Producer \n|ex-member of [[Exo (band)]]\n|-\n|[[Tiger Hu]]\n|34\n|36\n|Songwriting/Composition instructor\n|\n|-\n|[[Jason Zhang]]\n|35\n|37\n|rowspan=\"2\" |Vocal instructor\n|\n|-\n|[[Ella Chen]]\n|36\n|38\n|Member of [[S.H.E]]\n|-\n|[[Show Lo]]\n|38\n|40\n|rowspan=\"2\" |Dance instructor\n|\n|-\n|[[Wang Yibo]]\n|20\n|22\n|Member of [[UNIQ (band)|UNIQ]]\n|}\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n=== Episode 1 (April 21, 2018) ===\nThe audience is introduced to the Lady Bee trio who walks in to a dark studio wondering where to go. The lights suddenly turn on and 101 seats are shown. Similar to the Korean counterpart, contestants are introduced by label and choose where they want to sit from #1 to #101. Once every girl is seated, the studio darkens and [[Huang Zitao|Tao]] introduces the mentors with each of the mentors performing their own song. After the performances by the mentors have ended, contestants perform with their label mates or a pre-made group to be evaluated from grades A to F. During the episode, it is revealed that only 11 trainees are only to be sorted into the A group, once 11 girls are filled, another girl that has been given the A rank will have to take a girl's nominated seat, voluntarily if a girl in the top 11 chooses to downgrade to the B rank or through a battle. At the end of the episode, we see 11 spots filled yet Yamy is given an A rank. The mentors discuss heavily to choose whom to demote to B rank. They choose Qiang Dongyue and she  agrees to a battle with Yamy. Yamy wins the battle and Qiang Dongyue is reluctantly demoted to the B rank.\n\n=== Episode 2 (April 28, 2018) ===\nThe evaluations go on where former SNH48 member Ge Jiahui performs with her group and trainees continually get evaluated to their respective ranks. There is a twist after all 101 girls are graded when the mentors announce that girls who are not from idol companies will also be competing for a spot in the top 101. If any of them get above an F grade, they may take the spot of another girl in F grade, eliminating her from the competition. Gao Yingxi, Wu Qianying and Re Yina take Cindy, Dora and Zhao Ling's place on the show. Re Yina also receives an A grade and battles Li Ziting for her spot in A class. Re Yina wins. Sunnee questions the mentors on this decision and Tao responds saying Re Yina's style is more unique and Li Ziting went off key during the vocal part of the battle while Ye Rina did not. Tao reassures the trainees that if they felt they were placed in an incorrect grade if they work hard it will be seen.\nThe girls arrive at their dorms and all the trainees envy A class' rooms being pink and bigger than all the others and having its own couch. Yina and Sunnee are placed in the same room which causes some tension between them. \nDuring the first class, it is revealed that Abby left the competition overnight and one of the girls from the non-idol companies, Wang Ju, will be taking her place in C class. The F class girls walk into their small practice room and become emotional at seeing an easel with motivational writing on it in the middle of the room. All of them make a promise to move up. In A class, Re Yina has a hard time matching the tones of the vocal teacher and keeping up with the dance. Li Zixuan in B class gets called up to sing with Ella and begins to cry. Ella motivates her and gets her some sunglasses to cover her eyes to overcome her fear of singing in front of people. \nFor the first evaluation, it is revealed that the girls will come up five at a time and dance and sing the theme song in front of everyone. Yang Chaoyue performs poorly and cries afterwards due to embarrassment and stress. When Zhu Tiantian performs, she dances incorrectly and sings loudly and incorrectly, throwing off the other contestants dancing with her. This causes Gao Qiuzi to cry from the shock and stress. The other trainees accuse Zhu Tiantian of just wanting screen time and not caring if it affects other trainees in their individual interviews.\nWhen it comes to F class's turn to be re-graded, Show Luo surprises them by saying only one trainee has remained in F class and the rest have moved up. A class has their re-gradings read out in front of everyone. The biggest change is Re Yina going from A class to F class.\n\n=== Episode 3 (May 5, 2018) ===\nThe next mission is revealed to be a battle mission like the other 101 series. However, this time the 16 leaders and centres are already chosen and split into two types of eight each. Eight \"Skilled\" centres and eight \"Diligent\" centres. The \"Diligent\" centres are chosen from the eight girls who spent the most time practising while the eight \"Skilled\" centres are chosen by the mentors and restricted to A and B class. The rest of the girls choose whose team they want to be in by standing behind them. The battles are also not two teams performing the same songs, instead, the centres of each team pick the song they want from a list of 16 songs given to them. On the night of the performances, the mentors form two teams representing eight groups each. Show Luo and Zhang Jie's team consists of Liu Renyu (skilled), Wu Xuanyi (skilled), Kimberley (skilled), Meng Meiqi (skilled), Ju Lin (diligent), Lu Xiaocao (diligent), Zhang Xinjie (diligent) and Duan Aojuan's (diligent) groups. Ella and Hu Yanbin's team consists of Yamy (skilled), Sunnee (skilled), Li Ziting (skilled), Fu Jing (skilled), Zhu Tiantian (diligent), Qiang Dongyue (diligent), Jiang Yanxi (diligent) and Luo Yijia's (diligent) groups.\nThe mentors play black and white match to decide who will announce their first group first. Ella loses to Show Luo and chooses Yamy's group, Show Luo chooses Ju Lin's group. Yamy's group wins. Show Luo then picks Wu Xuanyi's group and Ella picks Sunnee's group, Sunnee's group wins. Show Luo then sends out Kimberley's group and Ella picks Li Ziting's group, Kimberley's group wins. Ella chooses Fu Jing's group and Show Luo chooses Meng Meiqi's group, Meng Meiqi's group wins. Ella chooses Zhu Tiantian's group and Show Lou chooses Liu Renyu's group, Liu Renyu's group wins. Ella choose Qiang Dongyue's group and Show Luo chooses Lu Xiaocao's group, Qiang Dongyue's group wins. Show Luo chooses Zhang Xinjie's group and Ella chooses Jiang Yanxi's group, Jiang Yanxi's group wins. Show Luo chooses Duan Aojuan's group and Ella chooses Luo Yijia's group, Duan Aojuan's group wins.\nThis leaves Ella and Show Luo's teams at four points each, the girl from the team with the most points who got the most votes is confirmed centre for the next mission, however, both teams are tied so the girl with the most points out of the eight winning teams wins the advantage. The advantage goes to Meng Meiqi.\n\n=== Episode 4 (May 13, 2018) ===\nThe girls walk into the room and figure out that only the top 55 will remain in the competition. The rankings are announced and it is revealed that their rank will determine their grade from that point on with ranks 55-41 becoming D class, ranks 40-26 becoming C class, ranks 25-12 becoming B class and ranks 11-1 becoming A class. Wu Xuanyi comes 1st and Yang Bing comes 55th. It is then revealed that the eight girls from the winning teams who gained the most votes in the public performances can each pick one member from their teams from the previous round who is not in the top 55 to avoid elimination and join the top 55 as a pending trainee. Tao explains that the pending trainees will not be able to make any choices in the next mission and the 3 pending trainees who get the most votes will stay in the competition. Meng Meiqi saves Jiang Shen (rank 59), Qiang Dongyue saves Luo Tianshu (rank 92), Duan Aojuan saves Liu Nian (rank 63), Sunnee's whole team entered the top 55 without being saved so Sunnee cannot save anyone, Zhao Yaoke saves Yang Han (rank 93), Yamy saves Wang Ju (rank 90), Kimberley saves Chen Yuyan (rank 82) and Yang Chaoyue saves Xu Shiyin (rank 75).\n\n=== Episode 5 (May 19, 2018) ===\nThe episode starts with the girls calling their families before the first elimination. The procedure for the second mission is revealed. There are six mentors that will hold three different classes; vocal (Ella and Zhang Jie), dance (Show Luo and Wang Yibo) and composition (Hu Yanbin and Lin Yoga). The girls will write down which class they want from most to least (1 being top pick, 3 being bottom pick). The mentors then look through the lists and pick which girls they want. If there are too many top picks for their class, they must choose which girls not to pick and if they do not have enough top picks they must choose some girls who did not pick that class as their top pick. There are 10 spots in composition, 19 spots in vocal and 31 spots in dance. The classes are then split into 12 groups; 2 in composition, 4 in vocal and 6 in dance. The team leaders for all 12 teams are picked from the highest ranked girls within that class. The leaders pick which girls they want to fill their team. The girls race for the song they want by relay, the boards with the song names are on a wall and they have to try and take the board they want. During the race for the dance team's songs, one of the girls falls and all the other girls keep running. This makes Tao very angry and he scolds the girls for many things including their actions during the elimination, talking during filming, not listening and not caring when the girl fell over. The dance teams are made to run again. All the teams then practice for their performance.\n\n=== Episode 6 (May 26, 2018) ===\nThe teams perform their stages with Meng Meiqi's group going first as she received the most votes on the last stage. It is noticed that there is a chair on the left-hand side of the stage, the chair is revealed to be for the overall popularity queen during the position battle stages. Meng Meiqi is the first popularity queen as her team goes first and she received the most votes within her team. It is explained that if another team's popularity queen receives more votes than her, they can dethrone her. It is also explained that the popularity queens in each team will also get to choose which group to perform next regardless of dethroning the current overall popularity queen or not. The team chosen to perform next is always chosen by the previous team's popularity queen. Meng Meiqi is dethroned by Li Ziting, Wu Xuanyi fails to dethrone Li Ziting which is a big shock, Liu Xiaoyu dethrones Li Ziting on the last performance and becomes the overall popularity queen. The seven pending trainees gather on stage for a voting round to see who will stay and who will be eliminated officially. Jiang Shen, Wang Ju and Liu Nian become normal trainees again.\n\n=== Episode 7 (June 2, 2018) ===\nThe episode starts with the girls lounging around in their dorms. They get an irregular announcement from Tao where he expresses his sorrow that the next time they meet, some of the girls will be leaving. He also announces and the staff have organised an activity for the girls and each dorm is given a set amount of money. The girls may go out and spend the money on decorations for their dorm room. The dorms will be judged and the winning dorm will win a surprise. The popularity award prize is a voucher to go out and watch a movie, the prize for the best design is a cute dollhouse of the dorm. Meng Meiqi, Yamy, Qiang Dongyue and Sunnee's team wins the best design award and Wang Qing, Gao Quizi, Xu Mengjie and Ma Xingyu's dorm wins the popularity award. The ranks are announced company by company with JC Universe Entertainment being announced first as they are the only group with all of their members currently in the competition. After the rankings, the top 36 girls have a special segment called \"Us, whom you did not know\" where the girls get to show off skills previously unknown to the public. Then Tao reveals the next mission which, like the other seasons, is the album missions. There are six songs. The centres are chosen by the fans from the girls who received the most votes for each song. The centres are:\n\nI Am That Kind Of Girl: Meng Meiqi\n\nShiny: Wu Xuanyi\n\nSomeone Else's Kid: Yamy\n\nLiving Up To Our Youth: Yang Chaoyue\n\nTears Of A Ferris Wheel: Zining\n\nAwesome: Lai Meiyun\n\nTao then announces that there will be six male idol seniors joining in the performances, one in each team. Each of them has left a secret message for the girls to try and guess who they are. The episode ends after the first secret message is played.\n\n=== Episode 8 (June 9, 2018) ===\nThe 36 girls are presented with 30 gifts on a table. Each of the 30 gifts somehow represents one of the six male idols that will join the teams.  Everyone except the centres can pick a gift. The male idols are already assigned to a group so the gift the trainee picks determines which group they will join. Before the girls pick their gifts, the secret messages from each idol are played. The idols, which songs they picked and their gifts are revealed and the teams are formed:\n\nI Am That Kind Of Girl (Xiao Zhan): Meng Meiqi, Wang Ting, Gao Qiuzi, Li Ziting, Liu Renyu and Xu Mengjie\n\nAwesome (Wei Daxun): Lai Meiyun, Luo Yitian, Duan Aojuan, Wang Mohan, Zhao Yaoke and Wang Ju\n\nShiny (Xiong Ziqi): Wu Xuanyi, Fan Wei, Su Ruiqi, Fu Jing, Gao Yingxi and Luo Yijia\n\nTears Of A Ferris Wheel (Hu Yitian): Zhang Zining, Wei Jin, Chen Yihan, Jiang Shen, Sunnee and Qiang Dongyue\n\nLiving Up To Our Youth (Mao Buyi): Yang Chaoyue, Qi Yandi, Chiao Manting, Lu Xiaoyu, Wu Qianying and Liu Danmeng\n\nSomeone Else's Kid (Wang Yibo): Li Zixuan, Lu Xiaocao, Angela Hui, Kimberley, Yamy and Wu Yingxiang\n\nThe group perform their songs and are then all invited back onstage so the fans can vote for their favourite team, the team that wins will receive a special coaching class from all of the mentors. I Am That Kind Of Girl wins the prize and Zining is crowned overall popularity queen.\n\n=== Episode 9 (June 16, 2018) ===\n\nIn this episode, the elimination instead, took place on a cruise unlike the past few rounds. From there, 14 of them were eliminated, leaving only 22 contestants who will be participating in the finals. The girls were then asked to choose between the songs \"Bye Bye Baby\" and \"Full Bloom\". The following is how they picked the respective songs:\n\nBye Bye Baby: Wang Ju, Wu Xuanyi, Yamy, Duan Aojuan Lai Meiyun, Gao Qiuzi, Sunnee, Fu Jing, Liu Renyu, Li Zixuan, Angela Hui.\n\nFull Bloom: Meng Meiqi, Li Ziting, Yang Chaoyue, Zi Ning, Gao Yingxi, Qi Yandi, Xu Mengjie, Wu Yingxiang, Qiang Dongyue, Chen Yihan.\n\n=== Episode 10 (June 23, 2018) ===\n\nThis episode begins with all 101 contestants dancing to the theme song \"Produce 101 Girls\" (Pick Me). The girls then performed either a \"vocal\" or \"dance\" performance individually and at the end of everyone's solo performance, performed as a group in their respective divisions. The episode thereafter cuts to the girls performing \"Against Odds\", followed by \"Full Bloom\" accordingly to their groups assigned in Episode 9. By the end of the episode, the rankings were announced and Meng Meiqi (with a vote count of 185,244,357), was crowned first place and center of the group, with Wu Xuanyi at second (with a vote count of 181,533,349). It was also revealed that the debuting group will be called \"Rocket Girls 101\". With that, the show ended with the newly formed group performing to their debut song \"Rocket Girls\".\n\n==Contestants==\n\n{{plainlist|\n*{{Color box|#FA8072|border=darkgray}} Left the

In 1785, the astronomer [[William Herschel]] noted a faint reddish hue in the core region of Andromeda. He believed Andromeda to be the nearest of all the \"great [[nebula]]e\", and based on the color and magnitude of the nebula, he incorrectly guessed that it was no more than 2,000 times the distance of [[Sirius]], or roughly {{convert|18,000|ly|kpc|abbr=on|lk=on}}.<ref name=\"Herschel 1785\" /> In 1850, [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse]]  made the first drawing of Andromeda's [[Spiral galaxy#Structure|spiral structure]].\n\nIn 1864, [[William Huggins]] noted that the [[spectrum]] of Andromeda differed from that of a gaseous nebula.<ref name=\"Huggins & Miller 1864\" /> The spectra of Andromeda displays a [[wikt:continuum|continuum]] of [[frequency|frequencies]], superimposed with dark [[spectral line|absorption lines]] that help identify the chemical composition of an object. Andromeda's spectrum is very similar to the spectra of individual stars, and from this, it was deduced that Andromeda has a stellar nature. In 1885, a [[supernova]] (known as [[SN 1885A|S Andromedae]]) was seen in Andromeda, the first and so far only one observed in that galaxy. At the time Andromeda was considered to be a nearby object, so the cause was thought to be a much less luminous and unrelated event called a [[nova]], and was named accordingly; \"Nova 1885\".<ref name=\"Backhouse 1888\" />\n\nIn 1887, [[Isaac Roberts]] took the first photographs of Andromeda, which was still commonly thought to be a nebula within our galaxy. Roberts mistook Andromeda and similar spiral nebulae as solar systems being formed.{{citation needed |date=April 2012}} In 1912, [[Vesto Slipher]] used [[spectroscopy]] to measure the radial velocity of Andromeda with respect to our [[Solar System]]\u2014the largest velocity yet measured, at {{convert|300|km/s|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Slipher 1913\" />\n\n=== Island universe ===\n[[File: Andromeda constellation map.svg|thumb|right|Location of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) in the Andromeda constellation.]]\n\nIn 1917, [[Heber Doust Curtis|Heber Curtis]] observed a [[nova]] within Andromeda. Searching the photographic record, 11 more novae were discovered. Curtis noticed that these novae were, on average, 10 [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitudes]] fainter than those that occurred elsewhere in the sky. As a result, he was able to come up with a distance estimate of {{convert|500000|ly|abbr=on}}.

To support his claim of the Great Andromeda Nebula being, in fact, an external galaxy, Curtis also noted the appearance of dark lanes within Andromeda which resembled the dust clouds in our own galaxy, as well as historical observations of Andromeda Galaxy's significant [[Doppler shift]]. In 1922 [[Ernst \u00d6pik]] presented a method to estimate the distance of Andromeda using the measured velocities of its stars. His result placed the Andromeda Nebula far outside our galaxy at a distance of about {{convert|450|kpc|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"\u00d6pik 1922\" /> [[Edwin Hubble]] settled the debate in 1925 when he identified extragalactic [[Cepheid variable star]]s for the first time on astronomical photos of Andromeda. These were made using the {{convert|2.5|m|adj=on}} [[Hooker telescope]], and they enabled the distance of Great Andromeda Nebula to be determined. His measurement demonstrated conclusively that this feature was not a cluster of stars and gas within our own galaxy, but an entirely separate galaxy located a significant distance from the Milky Way.<ref name=\"Hubble 1929\" />\n\nIn 1943, [[Walter Baade]] was the first person to resolve stars in the central region of the Andromeda Galaxy. Baade identified two distinct populations of stars based on their [[metallicity]], naming the young, high-velocity stars in the disk Type I and the older, red stars in the bulge Type II. This nomenclature was subsequently adopted for stars within the Milky Way, and elsewhere. (The existence of two distinct populations had been noted earlier by [[Jan Oort]].)<ref name=\"Baade 1944\" /> Baade also discovered that there were two types of Cepheid variables, which resulted in a doubling of the distance estimate to Andromeda, as well as the remainder of the Universe.<ref name=\"Gribbin 2001\" />\n\nIn 1950, radio emission from the Andromeda Galaxy was detected by [[Robert Hanbury Brown|Hanbury Brown]] and [[Cyril Hazard]] at [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]].<ref name=\"Brown & Hazard 1950\" /><ref name=\"Brown & Hazard 1951\" /> The first [[radio astronomy|radio maps]] of the galaxy were made in the 1950s by [[John E.

This was detected using a technique called [[microlensing]], which is caused by the deflection of light by a massive object.<ref name=\"Ingrosso 2009\" />\n\n== General ==\nThe estimated distance of the Andromeda Galaxy from our own was doubled in 1953 when it was discovered that there is another, dimmer type of [[Cepheid]].

During this epoch, its rate of [[star formation]] would have been [[Starburst galaxy|very high]], to the point of becoming a [[luminous infrared galaxy]] for roughly 100 million years. Andromeda and the [[Triangulum Galaxy]] had a very close passage 2\u20134 billion years ago. This event produced high rates of star formation across the Andromeda Galaxy's disk\u2014even some globular clusters\u2014and disturbed M33's outer disk.\n\nOver the past 2 billion years, star formation throughout Andromeda's disk is thought to have decreased to the point of near-inactivity. There have been interactions with satellite galaxies like M32, M110, or others that have already been absorbed by Andromeda Galaxy. These interactions have formed structures like [[List of stellar streams#Andromeda Galaxy streams|Andromeda's Giant Stellar Stream]]. A galactic merger roughly 100 million years ago is believed to be responsible for a counter-rotating disk of gas found in the center of Andromeda as well as the presence there of a relatively young (100 million years old) stellar population.<ref name=\"Davidge & McCoonnachie 2012\"/>\n\n=== Distance estimate ===\nAt least four distinct techniques have been used to estimate distances from Earth to the Andromeda Galaxy. In 2003, using the infrared [[surface brightness fluctuation]]s (I-SBF) and adjusting for the new period-luminosity value and a metallicity correction of \u22120.2 mag dex<sup>\u22121</sup> in (O/H), an estimate of {{convert|2.57|+/-|0.06|e6ly|lk=on|abbr=off}} was derived.

The binary{{efn|name=M31VJ}} is two hot blue stars of [[stellar classification|types]] O and B. By studying the eclipses of the stars, astronomers were able to measure their sizes. Knowing the sizes and temperatures of the stars, they were able to measure their [[absolute magnitude]]. When the [[apparent magnitude|visual]] and absolute magnitudes are known, the distance to the star can be calculated.

Dark blue-grey lanes of cooler dust show up starkly against these bright rings, tracing the regions where star formation is currently taking place in dense cloudy cocoons. When observed in visible light, Andromeda Galaxy's rings look more like spiral arms. The ultraviolet view shows that these arms more closely resemble the ring-like structure previously observed in infrared wavelengths with NASA's [[Spitzer Space Telescope]]. Astronomers using the latter interpreted these rings as evidence that the galaxy was involved in a direct collision with its neighbor, M32, more than 200 million years ago.]]\n\nBased on its appearance in visible light, the Andromeda Galaxy is classified as an SA(s)b galaxy in the [[Galaxy morphological classification#De Vaucouleurs system|de Vaucouleurs\u2013Sandage extended classification system]] of spiral galaxies.<ref name=\"ned\" /> However, infrared data from the [[2MASS]] survey and from the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] showed that Andromeda is actually a [[barred spiral galaxy]], like the Milky Way, with Andromeda's bar major axis oriented 55 degrees anti-clockwise from the disc major axis.<ref name=\"Beaton 2006\" />\n\nIn 2005, astronomers used the [[Keck telescopes]] to show that the tenuous sprinkle of stars extending outward from the galaxy is actually part of the main disk itself.<ref name=\"Chapman et al 2006\" /> This means that the spiral disk of stars in the Andromeda Galaxy is three times larger in diameter than previously estimated. This constitutes evidence that there is a vast, extended stellar disk that makes the galaxy more than {{convert|220000|ly|kpc|lk=on|abbr=off}} in diameter. Previously, estimates of the Andromeda Galaxy's size ranged from {{convert|70000|to|120000|ly|kpc}} across.\n\nThe galaxy is inclined an estimated 77\u00b0 relative to Earth (where an angle of 90\u00b0 would be viewed directly from the side). Analysis of the cross-sectional shape of the galaxy appears to demonstrate a pronounced, S-shaped warp, rather than just a flat disk.<ref name=\"UC Santa Cruz 2001\" /> A possible cause of such a warp could be gravitational interaction with the satellite galaxies near the Andromeda Galaxy. The Galaxy [[Triangulum Galaxy|M33]] could be responsible for some warp in Andromeda's arms, though more precise distances and radial velocities are required.\n\nSpectroscopic studies have provided detailed measurements of the [[Galaxy rotation curve|rotational velocity of the Andromeda Galaxy]] as a function of radial distance from the core. The rotational velocity has a maximum value of {{convert|225|km/s|abbr=on}} at {{convert|1300|ly|lk=on|abbr=on}} from the core, and it has its minimum possibly as low as {{convert|50|km/s|abbr=on}} at {{convert|7000|ly|abbr=on}} from the core. Further out, rotational velocity rises out to a radius of {{convert|33000|ly|abbr=on}}, where it reaches a peak of {{convert|250|km/s|abbr=on}}. The velocities slowly decline beyond that distance, dropping to around {{convert|200|km/s|abbr=on}} at {{convert|80000|ly|abbr=on}}. These velocity measurements imply a concentrated mass of about {{Solar mass|6{{e|9}}|link=y}} in the [[Galaxy nucleus|nucleus]]. The total mass of the galaxy increases [[linearity|linearly]] out to {{convert|45000|ly|abbr=on}}, then more slowly beyond that radius.<ref name=\"Rubin & Ford 1970\" />\n\nThe [[Spiral galaxy#Spiral arms|spiral arms]] of the Andromeda Galaxy are outlined by a series of [[H II region|HII regions]], first studied in great detail by [[Walter Baade]] and described by him as resembling \"beads on a string\".

In 1991, the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] was used to image Andromeda Galaxy's inner nucleus. The nucleus consists of two concentrations separated by {{convert|1.5|pc|lk=on|abbr=on}}. The brighter concentration, designated as P1, is offset from the center of the galaxy. The dimmer concentration, P2, falls at the true center of the galaxy and contains a [[black hole]] measured at 3\u20135 \u00d7 10<sup>7</sup> {{Solar mass}} in 1993,<ref name=\"Lauer\" /> and at 1.1\u20132.3 \u00d7 10<sup>8</sup> {{Solar mass}} in 2005.<ref name=\"Bender et al 2005\" /> The [[velocity dispersion]] of material around it is measured to be \u2248 {{convert|160|km/s|abbr=on|lk=on}}.<ref name=\"Gebhardt et al 2000\" />\n\n[[File:M31 Core in X-rays.jpg|thumb|[[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra X-ray telescope]] image of the center of Andromeda Galaxy. A number of X-ray sources, likely X-ray binary stars, within the galaxy's central region appear as yellowish dots. The blue source at the center is at the position of the [[supermassive black hole]].]]\n\nIt has been proposed that the observed double nucleus could be explained if P1 is the projection of a disk of stars in an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentric orbit]] around the central black hole.<ref name=\"Tremaine 1995\" /> The eccentricity is such that stars linger at the orbital [[apsis|apocenter]], creating a concentration of stars. P2 also contains a compact disk of hot, [[stellar classification|spectral-class]] A stars. The A stars are not evident in redder filters, but in blue and ultraviolet light they dominate the nucleus, causing P2 to appear more prominent than P1.<ref name=\"hubblesite 1993-07-20\" />\n\nWhile at the initial time of its discovery it was hypothesized that the brighter portion of the double nucleus is the remnant of a small galaxy \"cannibalized\" by Andromeda Galaxy,<ref name=\"Schewe & Stein 1993\" /> this is no longer considered a viable explanation, largely because such a nucleus would have an exceedingly short lifetime due to [[tidal force|tidal disruption]] by the central black hole. While this could be partially resolved if P1 had its own black hole to stabilize it, the distribution of stars in P1 does not suggest that there is a black hole at its center.<ref name=\"Tremaine 1995\" />\n\n== Discrete sources ==\n[[File:PIA20061 - Andromeda in High-Energy X-rays, Figure 1.jpg|thumb|center|400px|The Andromeda Galaxy in high-energy X-ray and ultraviolet light (released 5 January 2016).]]\n[[File: Andromeda active core.jpg|thumb|Artist's concept of the Andromeda Galaxy's core, showing a view across a disk of young, blue stars encircling a supermassive black hole.

The emission above 25 keV was later found to be originating from a single source named [[3XMM J004232.1+411314]], and identified as a binary system where a compact object (a [[neutron star]] or a [[black hole]]) accretes matter from a star.<ref name=\"Marelli et al. 2017\" />\n\nMultiple X-ray sources have since been detected in the Andromeda Galaxy, using observations from the [[European Space Agency]]'s (ESA) [[XMM-Newton]] orbiting observatory. [[Robin Barnard]] ''et al.'' hypothesized that these are candidate black holes or [[neutron star]]s, which are heating the incoming gas to millions of kelvins and emitting X-rays. Neutron stars and black holes can be distinguished mainly by measuring their masses.<ref name=\"Barnard Kolb & Osborne 2005\" /> An observation campaign of [[NuSTAR]] space mission identified 40 objects of this kind in the galaxy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Andromeda Galaxy Scanned with High-Energy X-ray Vision|url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4811|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref>\nIn 2012, a [[microquasar]], a radio burst emanating from a smaller black hole was detected in the Andromeda Galaxy.

What distinguishes them from the globular clusters is that they are much larger\u2014several hundred light-years across\u2014and hundreds of times less dense. The distances between the stars are, therefore, much greater within the newly discovered extended clusters.<ref name=\"Huxor et al 2005\" />\n\n== Satellites ==\n{{Main|Andromeda's satellite galaxies}}\n\n[[File:M31 09-01-2011.jpg|Messier 32 is to the left of the center, Messier 110 is to the bottom-right of the center.|thumb|right|250px]]\n\nLike the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy has [[satellite galaxy|satellite galaxies]], consisting of over 20 known [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]]. The best known and most readily observed satellite galaxies are [[Elliptical Galaxy M32|M32]] and [[Elliptical Galaxy M110|M110]]. Based on current evidence, it appears that M32 underwent a close encounter with the Andromeda Galaxy in the past.

One of the explanations for this is the gravitational lensing of a red giant with a mass between 0.02 and 3.6 masses of the Sun, which suggested that the star is likely a planet. This possible exoplanet would have mass of 6.34 times that of Jupiters mass. If finally confirmed, it would be the first ever found [[extragalactic planet]].

In 1785, the astronomer [[William Herschel]] noted a faint reddish hue in the core region of Andromeda. He believed Andromeda to be the nearest of all the \"great [[nebula]]e\", and based on the color and magnitude of the nebula, he incorrectly guessed that it was no more than 2,000 times the distance of [[Sirius]], or roughly {{convert|18,000|ly|kpc|abbr=on|lk=on}}.<ref name=\"Herschel 1785\" /> In 1850, [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse]]  made the first drawing of Andromeda's [[Spiral galaxy#Structure|spiral structure]].\n\nIn 1864, [[William Huggins]] noted that the [[spectrum]] of Andromeda differed from that of a gaseous nebula.<ref name=\"Huggins & Miller 1864\" /> The spectra of Andromeda displays a [[wikt:continuum|continuum]] of [[frequency|frequencies]], superimposed with dark [[spectral line|absorption lines]] that help identify the chemical composition of an object. Andromeda's spectrum is very similar to the spectra of individual stars, and from this, it was deduced that Andromeda has a stellar nature. In 1885, a [[supernova]] (known as [[SN 1885A|S Andromedae]]) was seen in Andromeda, the first and so far only one observed in that galaxy. At the time Andromeda was considered to be a nearby object, so the cause was thought to be a much less luminous and unrelated event called a [[nova]], and was named accordingly; \"Nova 1885\".<ref name=\"Backhouse 1888\" />\n\nIn 1887, [[Isaac Roberts]] took the first photographs of Andromeda, which was still commonly thought to be a nebula within our galaxy. Roberts mistook Andromeda and similar spiral nebulae as solar systems being formed.{{citation needed |date=April 2012}} In 1912, [[Vesto Slipher]] used [[spectroscopy]] to measure the radial velocity of Andromeda with respect to our [[Solar System]]\u2014the largest velocity yet measured, at {{convert|300|km/s|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Slipher 1913\" />\n\n=== Island universe ===\n[[File: Andromeda constellation map.svg|thumb|right|Location of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) in the Andromeda constellation.]]\n\nIn 1917, [[Heber Doust Curtis|Heber Curtis]] observed a [[nova]] within Andromeda. Searching the photographic record, 11 more novae were discovered. Curtis noticed that these novae were, on average, 10 [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitudes]] fainter than those that occurred elsewhere in the sky. As a result, he was able to come up with a distance estimate of {{convert|500000|ly|abbr=on}}.

To support his claim of the Great Andromeda Nebula being, in fact, an external galaxy, Curtis also noted the appearance of dark lanes within Andromeda which resembled the dust clouds in our own galaxy, as well as historical observations of Andromeda Galaxy's significant [[Doppler shift]]. In 1922 [[Ernst \u00d6pik]] presented a method to estimate the distance of Andromeda using the measured velocities of its stars. His result placed the Andromeda Nebula far outside our galaxy at a distance of about {{convert|450|kpc|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"\u00d6pik 1922\" /> [[Edwin Hubble]] settled the debate in 1925 when he identified extragalactic [[Cepheid variable star]]s for the first time on astronomical photos of Andromeda. These were made using the {{convert|2.5|m|adj=on}} [[Hooker telescope]], and they enabled the distance of Great Andromeda Nebula to be determined. His measurement demonstrated conclusively that this feature was not a cluster of stars and gas within our own galaxy, but an entirely separate galaxy located a significant distance from the Milky Way.<ref name=\"Hubble 1929\" />\n\nIn 1943, [[Walter Baade]] was the first person to resolve stars in the central region of the Andromeda Galaxy. Baade identified two distinct populations of stars based on their [[metallicity]], naming the young, high-velocity stars in the disk Type I and the older, red stars in the bulge Type II. This nomenclature was subsequently adopted for stars within the Milky Way, and elsewhere. (The existence of two distinct populations had been noted earlier by [[Jan Oort]].)<ref name=\"Baade 1944\" /> Baade also discovered that there were two types of Cepheid variables, which resulted in a doubling of the distance estimate to Andromeda, as well as the remainder of the Universe.<ref name=\"Gribbin 2001\" />\n\nIn 1950, radio emission from the Andromeda Galaxy was detected by [[Robert Hanbury Brown|Hanbury Brown]] and [[Cyril Hazard]] at [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]].<ref name=\"Brown & Hazard 1950\" /><ref name=\"Brown & Hazard 1951\" /> The first [[radio astronomy|radio maps]] of the galaxy were made in the 1950s by [[John E.

During this epoch, its rate of [[star formation]] would have been [[Starburst galaxy|very high]], to the point of becoming a [[luminous infrared galaxy]] for roughly 100 million years. Andromeda and the [[Triangulum Galaxy]] had a very close passage 2\u20134 billion years ago. This event produced high rates of star formation across the Andromeda Galaxy's disk\u2014even some globular clusters\u2014and disturbed M33's outer disk.\n\nOver the past 2 billion years, star formation throughout Andromeda's disk is thought to have decreased to the point of near-inactivity. There have been interactions with satellite galaxies like M32, M110, or others that have already been absorbed by Andromeda Galaxy. These interactions have formed structures like [[List of stellar streams#Andromeda Galaxy streams|Andromeda's Giant Stellar Stream]]. A galactic merger roughly 100 million years ago is believed to be responsible for a counter-rotating disk of gas found in the center of Andromeda as well as the presence there of a relatively young (100 million years old) stellar population.<ref name=\"Davidge & McCoonnachie 2012\"/>\n\n=== Distance estimate ===\nAt least four distinct techniques have been used to estimate distances from Earth to the Andromeda Galaxy.

The nearly invisible halo stretches about a million light-years from its host galaxy, halfway to our Milky Way galaxy. Simulations of galaxies indicate the halo formed at the same time as the Andromeda Galaxy. The halo is enriched in elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, formed from [[supernova]]e and its properties are those expected for a galaxy that lies in the \"green valley\" of the [[Galaxy color\u2013magnitude diagram]] (see [[Andromeda Galaxy#Luminosity|below]]). Supernovae erupt in Andromeda Galaxy's star-filled disk and eject these heavier elements into space. Over Andromeda Galaxy's lifetime, nearly half of the heavy elements made by its stars have been ejected far beyond the galaxy's 200,000-light-year-diameter stellar disk.<ref>{{Cite web|title = HubbleSite - NewsCenter - Hubble Finds Giant Halo Around the Andromeda Galaxy (05/07/2015) - The Full Story|url = http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2015/15/full/|website = hubblesite.org|accessdate = 7 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web \n|title = Hubble finds massive halo around the Andromeda Galaxy |url = https://news.nd.edu/news/hubble-finds-halo-around-the-andromeda-galaxy/ |website = University of Notre Dame News |date = 7 May 2015 |first=Marissa |last=Gebhard }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |title = Evidence for a Massive, Extended Circumgalactic Medium Around the Andromeda Galaxy |journal = The Astrophysical Journal |arxiv = 1404.6540 |date = 25 April 2014 |first = Nicolas |last = Lehner |first2 = Chris |last2 = Howk |first3 = Bart |last3 = Wakker |doi=10.1088/0004-637x/804/2/79 |bibcode=2015ApJ...804...79L |volume=804 |issue = 2 |pages=79 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = NASA's Hubble Finds Giant Halo Around the Andromeda Galaxy |url = http://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/nasa-s-hubble-finds-giant-halo-around-the-andromeda-galaxy|accessdate = 7 May 2015|date = 7 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Luminosity estimates ===\nCompared to the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy appears to have predominantly older stars with ages >7{{e|9}} years.<ref name=\"Tamm2012\" />{{clarify|date=January 2016}} The estimated [[luminosity]] of Andromeda Galaxy, {{Solar luminosity|~2.6{{e|10}}|link=y}}, is about 25% higher than that of our own galaxy.<ref name=\"vdb\" /> However, the galaxy has a high [[Orbital inclination|inclination]] as seen from Earth and its [[Cosmic dust|interstellar dust]] absorbs an unknown amount of light, so it is difficult to estimate its actual brightness and other authors have given other values for the luminosity of the Andromeda Galaxy (some authors even propose it is the second-brightest galaxy within a radius of 10 [[mega-]][[parsec]]s of the Milky Way, after the [[Sombrero Galaxy]],<ref name=\"Karachentsev2004\">{{cite journal\n    | last=Karachentsev |first=Igor D.\n    | last2=Karachentseva |first2=Valentina E.\n    | last3=Huchtmeier |first3=Walter K.\n    | last4=Makarov |first4=Dmitry I.\n    | title=A Catalog of Neighboring Galaxies\n    | journal=The Astronomical Journal\n    | date=2003\n    | volume=127\n    | issue=4\n    | pages=2031\u20132068\n    | bibcode=2004AJ....127.2031K\n    | doi=10.1086/382905}}</ref> with an absolute magnitude of around -22.21{{efn|name=bright m31}} or close<ref name=\"McCall2014\">{{cite journal\n    | last=McCall |first=Marshall L.\n    | title=A Council of Giants\n    | journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society\n    | date=2014\n    | volume=440\n    | issue=1\n    | pages=405\u2013426\n    | bibcode=2014MNRAS.440..405M\n    | doi=10.1093/mnras/stu199|arxiv = 1403.3667 }}</ref>).\n\nAn estimation done with the help of [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] published in 2010 suggests an [[absolute magnitude]] (in the blue) of \u221220.89 (that with a [[color index]] of +0.63 translates to an absolute visual magnitude of \u221221.52,{{efn|name=blue mag}} compared to \u221220.9 for the Milky Way), and a total luminosity in that [[wavelength]] of {{Solar luminosity|3.64{{e|10}}}}.<ref name=\"Tempel2010\">{{cite journal\n    | last=Tempel |first=Elmo\n    | last2=Tamm |first2=Antti\n    | last3=Tenjes |first3=Peeter\n    | title=Dust-corrected surface photometry of M 31 from Spitzer far-infrared observations\n    | journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics\n    | date=2010\n    | volume=509\n    | id=wA91\n    | bibcode=2010A&A...509A..91T\n    | doi=10.1051/0004-6361/200912186|arxiv = 0912.0124\n    | pages=A91 }}</ref>\n\nThe rate of star formation in the Milky Way is much higher, with Andromeda Galaxy producing only about one solar mass per year compared to 3\u20135 solar masses for the Milky Way. The rate of [[nova]]e in the Milky Way is also double that of Andromeda Galaxy.<ref name=\"Liller & Mayer 1987\" /> This suggests that the latter once experienced a great star formation phase, but is now in a relative state of quiescence, whereas the Milky Way is experiencing more active star formation.<ref name=\"vdb\" /> Should this continue, the luminosity of the Milky Way may eventually overtake that of Andromeda Galaxy.\n\nAccording to recent studies, the Andromeda Galaxy lies in what in the [[galaxy color\u2013magnitude diagram]] is known as the \"green valley,\" a region populated by galaxies like the Milky Way in transition from the \"blue cloud\" (galaxies actively forming new stars) to the \"red sequence\" (galaxies that lack star formation). Star formation activity in green valley galaxies is slowing as they run out of star-forming gas in the interstellar medium. In simulated galaxies with similar properties to Andromeda Galaxy, star formation is expected to extinguish within about five billion years from the now, even accounting for the expected, short-term increase in the rate of star formation due to the collision between Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way.<ref>{{cite journal \n|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/736/2/84 \n|title=The Mid-life Crisis of the Milky Way and M31 \n|date=2011 \n|last=Mutch |first=Simon J. \n|last2=Croton | first2=Darren J. \n|last3=Poole | first3=Gregory B.\n|journal=The Astrophysical Journal \n|volume=736 \n|issue=2 \n|bibcode = 2011ApJ...736...84M \n|arxiv = 1105.2564 \n|pages=84 }}</ref>\n\n== Structure ==\n[[File:Infraredandromeda.jpg|thumb|The Andromeda Galaxy seen in [[infrared]] by the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]], one of [[NASA]]'s four [[Great Observatories program|Great Space Observatories]].]]\n[[File:Andromeda galaxy Ssc2005-20a1.jpg|thumb|Image of the Andromeda Galaxy taken by Spitzer in infrared, 24 [[micrometre]]s (Credit:[[NASA]]/[[JPL]]\u2013[[Caltech]]/Karl D.

The bands of blue-white making up the galaxy's striking rings are neighborhoods that harbor hot, young, massive stars. Dark blue-grey lanes of cooler dust show up starkly against these bright rings, tracing the regions where star formation is currently taking place in dense cloudy cocoons. When observed in visible light, Andromeda Galaxy's rings look more like spiral arms. The ultraviolet view shows that these arms more closely resemble the ring-like structure previously observed in infrared wavelengths with NASA's [[Spitzer Space Telescope]]. Astronomers using the latter interpreted these rings as evidence that the galaxy was involved in a direct collision with its neighbor, M32, more than 200 million years ago.]]\n\nBased on its appearance in visible light, the Andromeda Galaxy is classified as an SA(s)b galaxy in the [[Galaxy morphological classification#De Vaucouleurs system|de Vaucouleurs\u2013Sandage extended classification system]] of spiral galaxies.<ref name=\"ned\" /> However, infrared data from the [[2MASS]] survey and from the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] showed that Andromeda is actually a [[barred spiral galaxy]], like the Milky Way, with Andromeda's bar major axis oriented between 40 and 60 degrees anti-clockwise  from the disc major axis.<ref name=\"Beaton 2006\" />\n\nIn 2005, astronomers used the [[Keck telescopes]] to show that the tenuous sprinkle of stars extending outward from the galaxy is actually part of the main disk itself.<ref name=\"Chapman et al 2006\" /> This means that the spiral disk of stars in the Andromeda Galaxy is three times larger in diameter than previously estimated. This constitutes evidence that there is a vast, extended stellar disk that makes the galaxy more than {{convert|220000|ly|kpc|lk=on|abbr=off}} in diameter. Previously, estimates of the Andromeda Galaxy's size ranged from {{convert|70000|to|120000|ly|kpc}} across.\n\nThe galaxy is inclined an estimated 77\u00b0 relative to Earth (where an angle of 90\u00b0 would be viewed directly from the side). Analysis of the cross-sectional shape of the galaxy appears to demonstrate a pronounced, S-shaped warp, rather than just a flat disk.<ref name=\"UC Santa Cruz 2001\" /> A possible cause of such a warp could be gravitational interaction with the satellite galaxies near the Andromeda Galaxy. The Galaxy [[Triangulum Galaxy|M33]] could be responsible for some warp in Andromeda's arms, though more precise distances and radial velocities are required.\n\nSpectroscopic studies have provided detailed measurements of the [[Galaxy rotation curve|rotational velocity of the Andromeda Galaxy]] as a function of radial distance from the core. The rotational velocity has a maximum value of {{convert|225|km/s|abbr=on}} at {{convert|1300|ly|lk=on|abbr=on}} from the core, and it has its minimum possibly as low as {{convert|50|km/s|abbr=on}} at {{convert|7000|ly|abbr=on}} from the core. Further out, rotational velocity rises out to a radius of {{convert|33000|ly|abbr=on}}, where it reaches a peak of {{convert|250|km/s|abbr=on}}. The velocities slowly decline beyond that distance, dropping to around {{convert|200|km/s|abbr=on}} at {{convert|80000|ly|abbr=on}}. These velocity measurements imply a concentrated mass of about {{Solar mass|6{{e|9}}|link=y}} in the [[Galaxy nucleus|nucleus]]. The total mass of the galaxy increases [[linearity|linearly]] out to {{convert|45000|ly|abbr=on}}, then more slowly beyond that radius.<ref name=\"Rubin & Ford 1970\" />\n\nThe [[Spiral galaxy#Spiral arms|spiral arms]] of the Andromeda Galaxy are outlined by a series of [[H II region|HII regions]], first studied in great detail by [[Walter Baade]] and described by him as resembling \"beads on a string\".

[[NASA]]/[[European Space Agency|ESA]]&nbsp;photo.]]\n\nM31 is known to harbor a dense and compact star cluster at its very center. In a large telescope it creates a visual impression of a star embedded in the more diffuse surrounding bulge. In 1991, the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] was used to image Andromeda Galaxy's inner nucleus. The nucleus consists of two concentrations separated by {{convert|1.5|pc|lk=on|abbr=on}}. The brighter concentration, designated as P1, is offset from the center of the galaxy. The dimmer concentration, P2, falls at the true center of the galaxy and contains a [[black hole]] measured at 3\u20135 \u00d7 10<sup>7</sup> {{Solar mass}} in 1993,<ref name=\"Lauer\" /> and at 1.1\u20132.3 \u00d7 10<sup>8</sup> {{Solar mass}} in 2005.<ref name=\"Bender et al 2005\" /> The [[velocity dispersion]] of material around it is measured to be \u2248 {{convert|160|km/s|abbr=on|lk=on}}.<ref name=\"Gebhardt et al 2000\" />\n\n[[File:M31 Core in X-rays.jpg|thumb|[[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra X-ray telescope]] image of the center of Andromeda Galaxy.

The blue source at the center is at the position of the [[supermassive black hole]].]]\n\nIt has been proposed that the observed double nucleus could be explained if P1 is the projection of a disk of stars in an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentric orbit]] around the central black hole.<ref name=\"Tremaine 1995\" /> The eccentricity is such that stars linger at the orbital [[apsis|apocenter]], creating a concentration of stars. P2 also contains a compact disk of hot, [[stellar classification|spectral-class]] A stars. The A stars are not evident in redder filters, but in blue and ultraviolet light they dominate the nucleus, causing P2 to appear more prominent than P1.<ref name=\"hubblesite 1993-07-20\" />\n\nWhile at the initial time of its discovery it was hypothesized that the brighter portion of the double nucleus is the remnant of a small galaxy \"cannibalized\" by Andromeda Galaxy,<ref name=\"Schewe & Stein 1993\" /> this is no longer considered a viable explanation, largely because such a nucleus would have an exceedingly short lifetime due to [[tidal force|tidal disruption]] by the central black hole. While this could be partially resolved if P1 had its own black hole to stabilize it, the distribution of stars in P1 does not suggest that there is a black hole at its center.<ref name=\"Tremaine 1995\" />\n\n== Discrete sources ==\n[[File:PIA20061 - Andromeda in High-Energy X-rays, Figure 1.jpg|thumb|center|400px|The Andromeda Galaxy in high-energy X-ray and ultraviolet light (released 5 January 2016).]]\n[[File: Andromeda active core.jpg|thumb|Artist's concept of the Andromeda Galaxy's core, showing a view across a disk of young, blue stars encircling a supermassive black hole.

The emission above 25 keV was later found to be originating from a single source named [[3XMM J004232.1+411314]], and identified as a binary system where a compact object (a [[neutron star]] or a [[black hole]]) accretes matter from a star.<ref name=\"Marelli et al. 2017\" />\n\nMultiple X-ray sources have since been detected in the Andromeda Galaxy, using observations from the [[European Space Agency]]'s (ESA) [[XMM-Newton]] orbiting observatory. [[Robin Barnard]] ''et al.'' hypothesized that these are candidate black holes or [[neutron star]]s, which are heating the incoming gas to millions of kelvins and emitting X-rays. Neutron stars and black holes can be distinguished mainly by measuring their masses.<ref name=\"Barnard Kolb & Osborne 2005\" /> An observation campaign of [[NuSTAR]] space mission identified 40 objects of this kind in the galaxy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Andromeda Galaxy Scanned with High-Energy X-ray Vision|url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4811|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref>\nIn 2012, a [[microquasar]], a radio burst emanating from a smaller black hole was detected in the Andromeda Galaxy.

But in 1609 he renewed the charter given to the company for an indefinite period, including a clause that specified that the charter would cease to be in force if the trade turned unprofitable for three consecutive years.\n\n== Foothold in India ==\n{{See also|History of Kolkata#Establishment of English trade in Bengal (1600\u20131700)|label 1=Establishment of English trade in Bengal (1600\u20131700)}}\n[[File:Reddragonship.jpg|thumb|{{ship||Red Dragon|1595|2}} fought the Portuguese at the [[Battle of Swally]] in 1612, and made several voyages to the [[East Indies]]]]\n[[File:Jahangir investing a courtier with a robe of honour watched by Sir Thomas Roe, English ambassador to the court of Jahangir at Agra from 1615-18, and others.jpg|thumb|275px|The emperor [[Jahangir]] investing a courtier with a robe of honour, watched by [[Sir Thomas Roe]], English ambassador to the court of Jahangir at Agra from 1615 to 1618, and others]]\n\nEnglish traders frequently engaged in hostilities with their Dutch and Portuguese counterparts in the Indian Ocean.

The company developed a [[lobbying|lobby]] in the English parliament.

The company sought a permanent establishment, while the Parliament would not willingly allow it greater autonomy and so relinquish the opportunity to exploit the company's profits. In 1712, another act renewed the status of the company, though the debts were repaid. By 1720, 15% of British imports were from India, almost all passing through the company, which reasserted the influence of the company lobby. The licence was prolonged until 1766 by yet another act in 1730.\n\nAt this time, Britain and France became bitter rivals. Frequent skirmishes between them took place for control of colonial possessions. In 1742, fearing the monetary consequences of a war, the British government agreed to extend the deadline for the licensed exclusive trade by the company in India until 1783, in return for a further loan of \u00a31&nbsp;million.

Demand for Indian commodities was boosted by the need to sustain the troops and the economy during the war, and by the increased availability of raw materials and efficient methods of production. As home to the revolution, Britain experienced higher standards of living. Its spiralling cycle of prosperity, demand and production had a profound influence on overseas trade.

Elsewhere in India, the French were to remain a military threat, particularly during the War of American Independence, and up to the capture of Pondich\u00e9ry in 1793 at the outset of the French Revolutionary Wars without any military presence. Although these small outposts remained French possessions for the next two hundred years, French ambitions on Indian territories were effectively laid to rest, thus eliminating a major source of economic competition for the company.\n\nThe East India Company had also been granted competitive advantages over colonial American tea importers to sell tea from its colonies in Asia in American colonies. This led to the [[Boston Tea Party]] in which protesters boarded British ships and threw the tea overboard. When protesters successfully prevented the unloading of tea in three other colonies and in Boston, Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain.

The great expansion came after 1750, when it had 3,000 regular troops. By 1763, it had 26,000; by 1778, it had 67,000. It recruited largely [[sepoy|Indian troops]] and trained them along European lines.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gerald Bryant |year=1978 |title=Officers of the East India Company's army in the days of Clive and Hastings |journal=The Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=203\u2013227 |doi=10.1080/03086537808582508}}</ref> The military arm of the East India Company quickly developed into a private corporate armed force used as an instrument of geo-political power and expansion instead of its original purpose as a guard force. Because of this, the EIC became the most powerful military force in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. As it increased in size, the army was divided into the [[Presidency Armies]] of [[Bengal Army|Bengal]], [[Madras Army|Madras]] and [[Bombay Army|Bombay]], each of which recruited its own [[infantry]], [[cavalry]], and [[artillery]] [[:Category:Honourable East India Company regiments|units]]. The navy also grew significantly, vastly expanding its [[:Category:Ships of the British East India Company|fleet]]. Although heavily armed merchant vessels, called East Indiamen, composed most of the fleet, it also included warships.\n\n==== Expansion and conquest ====\nThe company, fresh from a colossal victory, and with the backing of its own private, well-disciplined, and experienced army, was able to assert its interests in the [[Carnatic (region)|Carnatic region]] from its base at [[Madras]] and in Bengal from Calcutta, without facing any further obstacles from other colonial powers.<ref>{{cite book|author1=James Stuart Olson |author2=Robert Shadle |title=Historical Dictionary of the British Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L-X-XYB_ZkIC&pg=PA252|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood |pages=252\u2013254|isbn=978-0-313-29366-5}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Shah Alam II, 1790s.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Mughal Emperor [[Shah Alam II]], who with his allies fought against the East India Company during his early years (1760\u20131764), accepted the protection of the British in the year 1803, only after he had been blinded by his enemies and deserted by his subjects]]\n\nIt continued to experience resistance from local rulers during its expansion. Robert Clive led company forces against [[Siraj Ud Daulah]], the last independent [[Nawab]] of Bengal, [[Bihar]], and Midnapore district in Odisha to victory at the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757, resulting in the conquest of Bengal. This victory estranged the British and the Mughals, since Siraj Ud Daulah was a Mughal feudatory ally. That led to the [[Battle of Buxar]].\n\nWith the gradual weakening of the [[Maratha]]s in the aftermath of the three [[Anglo-Maratha wars]], the British also secured the Ganges-Jumna Doab, the Delhi-Agra region, parts of Bundelkhand, Broach, some districts of Gujarat, the fort of [[Ahmednagar]], [[Cuttack district|province of Cuttack]] (which included Mughalbandi/the coastal part of [[Odisha]], Garjat/the princely states of Odisha, [[Balasore]] Port, parts of [[Midnapore]] district of West Bengal), Bombay ([[Mumbai]]) and the surrounding areas, leading to a formal end of the Maratha empire and firm establishment of the British East India Company in India.\n\n[[Hyder Ali]] and [[Tipu Sultan]], the rulers of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], offered much resistance to the British forces. Having sided with the French during the Revolutionary War, the rulers of Mysore continued their struggle against the company with the four [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]]. Mysore finally fell to the company forces in 1799, in the fourth Anglo-Mysore war during which Tipu Sultan was killed.\n\n[[File:2-12th Madras Native Infantry at the Battle of Assaye, 1803.

The highest rank to which an Indian soldier could aspire was Subadar-Major (or Risaldar-Major in cavalry units), effectively a senior [[subaltern]] equivalent. Promotion for both British and Indian soldiers was strictly by seniority, so Indian soldiers rarely reached the commissioned ranks of Jamadar or Subadar before they were middle aged at best. They received no training in administration or leadership to make them independent of their British officers.\n\nDuring the wars against the French and their allies in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the East India Company's armies were used to seize the colonial possessions of other European nations, including the islands of [[R\u00e9union]] and [[Mauritius]]. Many [[East Indiaman|East India ships]] were seized by the French based on these islands during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. They were taken by the British in a [[Mauritius campaign of 1809\u20131811|hard fought campaign]] by 1811 and the French threat defeated. In the middle of 1809 the Colonial Governor of India, the [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 1st Earl of Minto|1st Earl of Minto]] wanted to conquer the lucrative Dutch owned [[Spice islands]] famous for nutmeg, mace and cloves. For the EIC the occupation of these islands meant not only a curtailment of Dutch and French trade and power in the East Indies but also an equivalent gain to the company of the rich trade in spice. In 1810 the islands including [[Banda Neira]], [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] and [[Ternate]] fell to a [[Invasion of the Spice Islands|British invasion]] with little loss. The following year [[Invasion of Java (1811)|Java fell to the British]] which completed the conquest of the Dutch East Indies. Minto appointed Sir [[Thomas Stamford Raffles]] as lieutenant governor of Java. The British held on to the islands until the end of the war - the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814|Anglo-Dutch Treaty]] of 1814 meant that they were handed back to the Dutch. The EIC nevertheless had uprooted a lot of the spice trees for [[Transplanting|transplantation]] throughout the [[British Empire]]. By the 1790s the EIC had established a number of spice gardens in [[Penang]]; by 1815 the gardens had significantly expanded to 13,000 nutmeg trees and as many as 20,000 clove trees.<ref name=\"Milne\">{{cite news |title=Banda, the nutmeg treasure islands |first=Peter |last=Milne |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/01/16/banda-nutmeg-treasure-islands.html |newspaper=Jakarta Post |location=Jakarta |date=16 Jan 2011 |pages=10\u201311 |accessdate=22 Dec 2011 |quote=But the economic importance of the Bandas was only fleeting.

The growth of tensions between the EIC and the local religious and cultural groups grew in the 19th century as the Protestant revival grew in Great Britain.

The proceeds of the drug-smugglers landing their cargoes at [[Lintin Island]] were paid into the company's factory at [[Guangzhou|Canton]] and by 1825, most of the money needed to buy tea in China was raised by the illegal opium trade.\n\nThe company established a group of trading settlements centred on the Straits of Malacca called the [[Straits Settlements]] in 1826 to protect its trade route to China and to combat local piracy. The settlements were also used as penal settlements for Indian civilian and military prisoners.\n\nIn 1838 with the amount of smuggled opium entering China approaching 1,400 tons a year, the Chinese imposed a death penalty for opium smuggling and sent a Special Imperial Commissioner, [[Lin Zexu]], to curb smuggling. This resulted in the [[First Opium War]] (1839\u201342).

The [[Bengal famine of 1770]], in which one-third of the local population died, caused distress in Britain. Military and administrative costs mounted beyond control in British-administered regions in Bengal because of the ensuing drop in labour productivity.\n\nAt the same time, there was commercial stagnation and trade depression throughout Europe. The directors of the company attempted to avert bankruptcy by appealing to Parliament for financial help. This led to the passing of the [[Tea Act]] in 1773, which gave the company greater autonomy in running its trade in the American colonies, and allowed it an exemption from tea import duties which its colonial competitors were required to pay.\n\nWhen the American colonists and tea merchants were told of this Act, they boycotted the company tea. Although the price of tea had dropped because of the Act, it also validated the [[Townshend Acts]], setting the precedent for the king to impose additional taxes in the future. The arrival of tax-exempt Company tea, undercutting the local merchants, triggered the [[Boston Tea Party]] in the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], one of the major events leading up to the [[American Revolution]].\n\n=== Regulating Acts of Parliament ===\n\n==== East India Company Act 1773 ====\nBy the [[Regulating Act of 1773]] (later known as the East India Company Act 1773), the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] imposed a series of administrative and economic reforms; this clearly established Parliament's sovereignty and ultimate control over the company. The Act recognised the company's political functions and clearly established that the \"[[acquisition of sovereignty]] by the subjects of the Crown is on behalf of the Crown and not in its own right\".\n\n[[File:Nawab Mubarak al-Daula of Murshidabad (1770-93) enthroned in durbar.jpg|thumb|Nawab [[Mubarak Ali Khan (Nawab of Bengal)|Mubarak Ali Khan]] with his son in the Nawab's ''[[Durbar (court)|Durbar]]'' with [[British Resident]], Sir [[Sir John D'Oyly, 6th Baronet|John Hadley]]]]\n\nDespite stiff resistance from the East India lobby in Parliament and from the company's shareholders, the Act passed. It introduced substantial governmental control and allowed British India to be formally under the control of the Crown, but leased back to the company at \u00a340,000 for two years. Under the Act's most important provision, a governing Council composed of five members was created in Calcutta. The three members nominated by Parliament and representing the government's interest could, and invariably would, outvote the two Company members. The Council was headed by [[Warren Hastings]], the incumbent governor, who became the first [[governor-general of Bengal]], with an ill-defined authority over the Bombay and Madras Presidencies.<ref>Keay, John (1991). ''The Honourable Company: A History of the English East India Company''.

British judges and magistrates would also be sent to India to administer the legal system. The governor-general and the council would have complete legislative powers. The company was allowed to maintain its virtual monopoly over trade in exchange for the biennial sum and was obligated to export a minimum quantity of goods yearly to Britain. The costs of administration were to be met by the company. The company initially welcomed these provisions, but the annual burden of the payment contributed to the steady decline of its finances.<ref name=\"Anthony, Frank Pages 18- 19\" />\n\n==== East India Company Act 1784 (Pitt's India Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe East India Company Act 1784 ([[Pitt's India Act]]) had two key aspects:\n* Relationship to the British government: the bill differentiated the East India Company's political functions from its commercial activities. In political matters the East India Company was subordinated to the British government directly. To accomplish this, the Act created a [[India Board|Board of Commissioners for the Affairs of India]], usually referred to as the Board of Control. The members of the Board were the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], the [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]], and four [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Councillors]], nominated by the King. The act specified that the Secretary of State \"shall preside at, and be [[President of the Board of Control|President of the said Board]]\".\n* Internal Administration of British India: the bill laid the foundation for the centralised and bureaucratic British administration of India which would reach its peak at the beginning of the 20th century during the governor-generalship of [[George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Baron Curzon]].\n\nPitt's Act was deemed a failure because it quickly became apparent that the boundaries between government control and the company's powers were nebulous and highly subjective. The government felt obliged to respond to humanitarian calls for better treatment of local peoples in British-occupied territories. [[Edmund Burke]], a former East India Company shareholder and diplomat, was moved to address the situation and introduced a new Regulating Bill in 1783. The bill was defeated amid lobbying by company loyalists and accusations of nepotism in the bill's recommendations for the appointment of councillors.\n\n==== Act of 1786 ====\n[[File:Surrender of Tipu Sultan.jpg|thumb|General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]], receiving two of [[Tipu Sultan]]'s sons as hostages in the year 1793]]\n\nThe Act of 1786 (26 Geo. 3 c. 16) enacted the demand of [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Earl Cornwallis]] that the powers of the governor-general be enlarged to empower him, in special cases, to override the majority of his Council and act on his own special responsibility. The Act enabled the offices of the governor-general and the commander-in-chief to be jointly held by the same official.\n\nThis Act clearly demarcated borders between the Crown and the company. After this point, the company functioned as a regularised subsidiary of the Crown, with greater accountability for its actions and reached a stable stage of expansion and consolidation. Having temporarily achieved a state of truce with the Crown, the company continued to expand its influence to nearby territories through threats and coercive actions. By the middle of the 19th century, the company's rule extended across most of India, [[British rule in Burma|Burma]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]], and [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], and a fifth of the world's population was under its trading influence. In addition, [[Penang Island]], ceded from the [[Kedah Sultanate]] in Malaya, became the fourth most important settlement, a presidency, of the company's Indian territories.<ref>Langdon, Marcus; [http://arecabooks.com/product/penang-the-fourth-presidency-of-india-vol-1/ \"Penang: The Fourth Presidency of India 1805\u20131830, Volume One: Ships, Men and Mansions\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703023731/http://arecabooks.com/product/penang-the-fourth-presidency-of-india-vol-1/ |date=3 July 2014 }}, Areca Books, 2013. {{ISBN|978-967-5719-07-3}}</ref>\n\n==== East India Company Act 1793 (Charter Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe company's charter was renewed for a further 20&nbsp;years by the [[Charter Act of 1793]]. In contrast with the legislative proposals of the previous two decades, the 1793 Act was not a particularly controversial measure, and made only minimal changes to the system of government in India and to British oversight of the company's activities. Sale of liquor was forbidden without licence.

The Indian princes had become vassals of the company. But the expense of wars leading to the total control of India strained the company's finances. The company was forced to petition Parliament for assistance. This was the background to the [[Charter Act of 1813]] which, among other things:\n* asserted the sovereignty of the British Crown over the Indian territories held by the company;\n* renewed the charter of the company for a further twenty years, but\n** deprived the company of its Indian trade monopoly except for trade in tea and the trade with China\n** required the company to maintain separate and distinct its commercial and territorial accounts\n* opened India to missionaries\n\n==== Government of India Act 1833 ====\nThe Industrial Revolution in Britain, the consequent search for markets, and the rise of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic ideology form the background to the [[Saint Helena Act 1833|Government of India Act 1833]] (3 & 4 Will. 4 c. 85). The Act:\n* removed the company's remaining trade monopolies and divested it of all its commercial functions\n* renewed for another twenty years the company's political and administrative authority\n* invested the Board of Control with full power and authority over the company.

After occupying premises in [[Philpot Lane]] from 1600 to 1621; in [[Crosby Hall, London|Crosby House]], [[Bishopsgate]], from 1621 to 1638; and in Leadenhall Street from 1638 to 1648, the company moved into Craven House, an Elizabethan mansion in Leadenhall Street. The building had become known as East India House by 1661. It was completely rebuilt and enlarged in 1726\u20131729; and further significantly remodelled and expanded in 1796\u20131800. It was finally vacated in 1860 and demolished in 1861\u20131862. The site is now occupied by the [[Lloyd's building]].\n\nIn 1607, the company decided to build its own ships and leased a yard on the [[River Thames]] at [[Deptford]]. By 1614, the yard having become too small, an alternative site was acquired at [[Blackwall Yard|Blackwall]]: the new yard was fully operational by 1617. It was sold in 1656, although for some years East India Company ships continued to be built and repaired there under the new owners.\n\nIn 1803, an Act of Parliament, promoted by the East India Company, established the East India Dock Company, with the aim of establishing a new set of docks (the [[East India Docks]]) primarily for the use of ships trading with India. The existing Brunswick Dock, part of the Blackwall Yard site, became the Export Dock; while a new Import Dock was built to the north. In 1838 the East India Dock Company merged with the [[West India Docks|West India Dock Company]]. The docks were taken over by the [[Port of London Authority]] in 1909, and closed in 1967.\n\n[[File:Addiscombe Seminary photo c.1859.jpg|thumb|left|[[Addiscombe Military Seminary|Addiscombe Seminary]], photographed in ''c''.1859, with cadets in the foreground]]\n\nThe [[East India Company College|East India College]] was founded in 1806 as a training establishment for \"writers\" (i.e. clerks) in the company's service.

In 1858 the college closed; but in 1862 the buildings reopened as a [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]], now [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College]].\n\nThe [[Addiscombe Military Seminary|East India Company Military Seminary]] was founded in 1809 at [[Addiscombe]], near [[Croydon]], Surrey, to train young officers for service in the company's armies in India.

In 1861 it was closed, and the site was subsequently redeveloped.\n\nIn 1818, the company entered into an agreement by which those of its servants who were certified insane in India might be cared for at Pembroke House, [[Hackney (parish)|Hackney]], London, a private [[History of psychiatric institutions|lunatic asylum]] run by Dr George Rees until 1838, and thereafter by Dr William Williams.

Although dissolved by the [[East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act 1873]] following the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|rebellion of 1857]], it stimulated the growth of the [[British Empire]]. Its professionally trained armies rose to dominate the sub-continent and were to become the armies of British India after 1857. It played a key role in introducing English as an official language in India. This also led to [[Macaulayism]] in the Indian subcontinent.\n[[File:Panorama of a durbar procession of Akbar II (Retouched).jpg|thumb|Panorama of a [[Durbar (court)|durbar]] procession of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Akbar II]], 1806-37. The Emperor is followed by the British Resident.]]\nOnce the East India Company took over Bengal in the [[treaty of Allahabad]] (1765) it collected taxes which it used to further its expansion to the rest of India and did not have to rely on venture capital from London. It returned a high profit to those who risked original money for earlier ventures into Bengal.\n\nDuring the first century of the East India Company's expansion in India, most people in India lived under regional kings or Nawabs. By the late 18th century many Moghuls were weak in comparison to the rapidly expanding Company as it took over cities and land, built railways, roads and bridges. The first railway of 21 mile (33.8&nbsp;km),<ref>Rao, M.A. (1988). ''Indian Railways'', New Delhi: National Book Trust, p.15</ref> known as the [[Great Indian Peninsula Railway]] ran between Bombay (Mumbai) and Tannah (Thane) in 1849. The Company sought quick profits because the financial backers in England took high risks: their money for possible profits or losses through shipwrecks, wars or calamities.\n\nThe increasingly large territory the Company was annexing and collecting taxes was also run by the local Nawabs. In essence, it was a dual administration. Between 1765 and 1772 [[Robert Clive]] gave the responsibility of tax collecting, [[diwani]], to the Indian deputy and judicial and police responsibilities to other Indian deputies. The Company concentrated its new power of collecting revenue and left the responsibilities to the Indian agencies. The East India Company took the beginning steps of British takeover of power in India for centuries to come. In 1772, the Company made [[Warren Hastings]], who had been in India with the Company since 1750, its first governor-general to manage and overview all of the annexed lands. The dual administration system came to an end.\n\nHastings learned Urdu and Persian and took great interest in preserving ancient Sanskrit manuscripts and having them translated into English. He employed many Indians as officials.<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Suijk, Paul (Director) | date=2015 | title=The British East India Company | trans-title = The Great Courses (Episode 24,19:11) | medium=on-line video | location=Brentwood Associates/The Teaching Company Sales.

This was not so that they could carry cannon to fend off warships, privateers, and pirates on their voyages to India and China (that they could do without permission) but so that, should they have the opportunity to take a prize, they could do so without being guilty of piracy. Similarly, the ''Earl of Mornington'', an East India Company [[packet ship]] of only six guns, also sailed under a letter of marque.\n\nIn addition, the company had its own navy, the [[History of the Indian Navy|Bombay Marine]], equipped with warships such as {{ship|HCS|Grappler|1804|2}}. These vessels often accompanied vessels of the Royal Navy on expeditions, such as the [[Invasion of Java (1811)|Invasion of Java]].\n\nAt the [[Battle of Pulo Aura]], which was probably the company's most notable naval victory, [[Nathaniel Dance]], Commodore of a convoy of Indiamen and sailing aboard the {{ship||Warley|1796 ship|2}}, led several Indiamen in a skirmish with a French squadron, driving them off. Some six years earlier, on 28 January 1797, five Indiamen, the ''Woodford'', under Captain Charles Lennox, the ''Taunton-Castle'', Captain Edward Studd, ''Canton'', Captain Abel Vyvyan, ''Boddam'', Captain George Palmer, and {{ship||Ocean|1788 EIC ship|2}}, Captain John Christian Lochner, had encountered Admiral [[Pierre C\u00e9sar Charles de Sercey|de Sercey]] and his squadron of frigates. On this occasion the Indiamen also succeeded in bluffing their way to safety, and without any shots even being fired.

The company opened a [[factory (trading post)|factory]] in [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]] on the first voyage, and imports of [[Black pepper|pepper]] from [[Java]] were an important part of the company's trade for twenty years. The factory in Bantam was closed in 1683. During this time ships belonging to the company arriving in India docked at [[Surat]], which was established as a trade transit point in 1608.\n\nIn the next two years, the company established its first factory in south India in the town of [[Machilipatnam]] on the [[Coromandel Coast]] of the [[Bay of Bengal]]. The high profits reported by the company after landing in India initially prompted James I to grant subsidiary licences to other trading companies in England. But in 1609 he renewed the charter given to the company for an indefinite period, including a clause that specified that the charter would cease to be in force if the trade turned unprofitable for three consecutive years.\n\n== Foothold in India ==\n{{See also|History of Kolkata#Establishment of English trade in Bengal (1600\u20131700)|label 1=Establishment of English trade in Bengal (1600\u20131700)}}\n[[File:Reddragonship.jpg|thumb|{{ship||Red Dragon|1595|2}} fought the Portuguese at the [[Battle of Swally]] in 1612, and made several voyages to the [[East Indies]]]]\n[[File:Jahangir investing a courtier with a robe of honour watched by Sir Thomas Roe, English ambassador to the court of Jahangir at Agra from 1615-18, and others.jpg|thumb|275px|The emperor [[Jahangir]] investing a courtier with a robe of honour, watched by [[Sir Thomas Roe]], English ambassador to the court of Jahangir at Agra from 1615 to 1618, and others]]\n\nEnglish traders frequently engaged in hostilities with their Dutch and Portuguese counterparts in the Indian Ocean. The company achieved a major victory over the Portuguese in the [[Battle of Swally]] in 1612, at [[Suvali]] in [[Surat]]. The company decided to explore the feasibility of gaining a territorial foothold in mainland India, with official sanction from both Britain and the [[Mughal Empire]], and requested that the Crown launch a diplomatic mission.<ref name=\"fordham1\">The battle of Plassey ended the tax on the Indian goods.

The company developed a [[lobbying|lobby]] in the English parliament. Under pressure from ambitious tradesmen and former associates of the company (pejoratively termed ''Interlopers'' by the company), who wanted to establish private trading firms in India, a deregulating act was passed in 1694.<ref name=\"victorianweb.org\">{{Cite web|url=http://victorianweb.org/history/empire/india/eic.html|title=The British East India Company \u2014 the Company that Owned a Nation (or Two)|website=victorianweb.org}}</ref>\n\nThis allowed any English firm to trade with India, unless specifically prohibited by act of parliament, thereby annulling the charter that had been in force for almost 100 years.

The companies merged in 1708, by a tripartite indenture involving both companies and the state, with the charter and agreement for the new ''United Company of Merchants of England Trading to the East Indies'' being awarded by the [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3t0TAAAAQAAJ|title=Charters Relating to the East India Company from 1600 to 1761: Reprinted from a Former Collection with Some Additions and a Preface for the Government of Madras|last=Company|first=East India|last2=Shaw|first2=John|date=1887|publisher=R.

The company sought a permanent establishment, while the Parliament would not willingly allow it greater autonomy and so relinquish the opportunity to exploit the company's profits. In 1712, another act renewed the status of the company, though the debts were repaid. By 1720, 15% of British imports were from India, almost all passing through the company, which reasserted the influence of the company lobby. The licence was prolonged until 1766 by yet another act in 1730.\n\nAt this time, Britain and France became bitter rivals. Frequent skirmishes between them took place for control of colonial possessions. In 1742, fearing the monetary consequences of a war, the British government agreed to extend the deadline for the licensed exclusive trade by the company in India until 1783, in return for a further loan of \u00a31&nbsp;million. Between 1756 and 1763, the [[Seven Years' War]] diverted the state's attention towards consolidation and [[French and Indian War|defence of its territorial possessions]] in Europe and its [[English colonization of the Americas|colonies in North America]].<ref name=\"oxforddnb.com\">Thomas, P.

In 1757, the [[Law Officers of the Crown]] delivered the [[Pratt\u2013Yorke opinion]] distinguishing overseas territories acquired by [[right of conquest]] from those acquired by private [[treaty]]. The opinion asserted that, while the Crown of Great Britain enjoyed sovereignty over both, only the property of the former was vested in the Crown.<ref name=\"oxforddnb.com\" />\n\nWith the advent of the [[Industrial Revolution]], Britain surged ahead of its European rivals. Demand for Indian commodities was boosted by the need to sustain the troops and the economy during the war, and by the increased availability of raw materials and efficient methods of production. As home to the revolution, Britain experienced higher standards of living. Its spiralling cycle of prosperity, demand and production had a profound influence on overseas trade.

Elsewhere in India, the French were to remain a military threat, particularly during the War of American Independence, and up to the capture of Pondich\u00e9ry in 1793 at the outset of the French Revolutionary Wars without any military presence. Although these small outposts remained French possessions for the next two hundred years, French ambitions on Indian territories were effectively laid to rest, thus eliminating a major source of economic competition for the company.\n\nThe East India Company had also been granted competitive advantages over colonial American tea importers to sell tea from its colonies in Asia in American colonies. This led to the [[Boston Tea Party]] in which protesters boarded British ships and threw the tea overboard. When protesters successfully prevented the unloading of tea in three other colonies and in Boston, Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain.

Because of this, the EIC became the most powerful military force in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. As it increased in size, the army was divided into the [[Presidency Armies]] of [[Bengal Army|Bengal]], [[Madras Army|Madras]] and [[Bombay Army|Bombay]], each of which recruited its own [[infantry]], [[cavalry]], and [[artillery]] [[:Category:Honourable East India Company regiments|units]]. The navy also grew significantly, vastly expanding its [[:Category:Ships of the British East India Company|fleet]]. Although heavily armed merchant vessels, called East Indiamen, composed most of the fleet, it also included warships.\n\n==== Expansion and conquest ====\nThe company, fresh from a colossal victory, and with the backing of its own private, well-disciplined, and experienced army, was able to assert its interests in the [[Carnatic (region)|Carnatic region]] from its base at [[Madras]] and in Bengal from Calcutta, without facing any further obstacles from other colonial powers.<ref>{{cite book|author1=James Stuart Olson |author2=Robert Shadle |title=Historical Dictionary of the British Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L-X-XYB_ZkIC&pg=PA252|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood |pages=252\u2013254|isbn=978-0-313-29366-5}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Shah Alam II, 1790s.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Mughal Emperor [[Shah Alam II]], who with his allies fought against the East India Company during his early years (1760\u20131764), accepted the protection of the British in the year 1803, only after he had been blinded by his enemies and deserted by his subjects]]\n\nIt continued to experience resistance from local rulers during its expansion. Robert Clive led company forces against [[Siraj Ud Daulah]], the last independent [[Nawab]] of Bengal, [[Bihar]], and Midnapore district in Odisha to victory at the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757, resulting in the conquest of Bengal. This victory estranged the British and the Mughals, since Siraj Ud Daulah was a Mughal feudatory ally. That led to the [[Battle of Buxar]].\n\nWith the gradual weakening of the [[Maratha]]s in the aftermath of the three [[Anglo-Maratha wars]], the British also secured the Ganges-Jumna Doab, the Delhi-Agra region, parts of Bundelkhand, Broach, some districts of Gujarat, the fort of [[Ahmednagar]], [[Cuttack district|province of Cuttack]] (which included Mughalbandi/the coastal part of [[Odisha]], Garjat/the princely states of Odisha, [[Balasore]] Port, parts of [[Midnapore]] district of West Bengal), Bombay ([[Mumbai]]) and the surrounding areas, leading to a formal end of the Maratha empire and firm establishment of the British East India Company in India.\n\n[[Hyder Ali]] and [[Tipu Sultan]], the rulers of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], offered much resistance to the British forces. Having sided with the French during the Revolutionary War, the rulers of Mysore continued their struggle against the company with the four [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]]. Mysore finally fell to the company forces in 1799, in the fourth Anglo-Mysore war during which Tipu Sultan was killed.\n\n[[File:2-12th Madras Native Infantry at the Battle of Assaye, 1803.

The highest rank to which an Indian soldier could aspire was Subadar-Major (or Risaldar-Major in cavalry units), effectively a senior [[subaltern]] equivalent. Promotion for both British and Indian soldiers was strictly by seniority, so Indian soldiers rarely reached the commissioned ranks of Jamadar or Subadar before they were middle aged at best. They received no training in administration or leadership to make them independent of their British officers.\n\nDuring the wars against the French and their allies in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the East India Company's armies were used to seize the colonial possessions of other European nations, including the islands of [[R\u00e9union]] and [[Mauritius]]. Many [[East Indiaman|East India ships]] were seized by the French based on these islands during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. They were taken by the British in a [[Mauritius campaign of 1809\u20131811|hard fought campaign]] by 1811 and the French threat defeated. In the middle of 1809 the Colonial Governor of India, the [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 1st Earl of Minto|1st Earl of Minto]] wanted to conquer the lucrative Dutch owned [[Spice islands]] famous for nutmeg, mace and cloves. For the EIC the occupation of these islands meant not only a curtailment of Dutch and French trade and power in the East Indies but also an equivalent gain to the company of the rich trade in spice. In 1810 the islands including [[Banda Neira]], [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] and [[Ternate]] fell to a [[Invasion of the Spice Islands|British invasion]] with little loss. The following year [[Invasion of Java (1811)|Java fell to the British]] which completed the conquest of the Dutch East Indies. Minto appointed Sir [[Thomas Stamford Raffles]] as lieutenant governor of Java. The British held on to the islands until the end of the war - the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814|Anglo-Dutch Treaty]] of 1814 meant that they were handed back to the Dutch. The EIC nevertheless had uprooted a lot of the spice trees for [[Transplanting|transplantation]] throughout the [[British Empire]]. By the 1790s the EIC had established a number of spice gardens in [[Penang]]; by 1815 the gardens had significantly expanded to 13,000 nutmeg trees and as many as 20,000 clove trees.<ref name=\"Milne\">{{cite news |title=Banda, the nutmeg treasure islands |first=Peter |last=Milne |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/01/16/banda-nutmeg-treasure-islands.html |newspaper=Jakarta Post |location=Jakarta |date=16 Jan 2011 |pages=10\u201311 |accessdate=22 Dec 2011 |quote=But the economic importance of the Bandas was only fleeting.

The proceeds of the drug-smugglers landing their cargoes at [[Lintin Island]] were paid into the company's factory at [[Guangzhou|Canton]] and by 1825, most of the money needed to buy tea in China was raised by the illegal opium trade.\n\nThe company established a group of trading settlements centred on the Straits of Malacca called the [[Straits Settlements]] in 1826 to protect its trade route to China and to combat local piracy. The settlements were also used as penal settlements for Indian civilian and military prisoners.\n\nIn 1838 with the amount of smuggled opium entering China approaching 1,400 tons a year, the Chinese imposed a death penalty for opium smuggling and sent a Special Imperial Commissioner, [[Lin Zexu]], to curb smuggling. This resulted in the [[First Opium War]] (1839\u201342). After the war Hong Kong island was ceded to Britain under the [[Treaty of Nanking]] and the Chinese market opened to the opium traders of Britain and other nations.<ref name=\"Windle 2012 55\u201374\" /> The Jardines and [[Apcar and Company]] dominated the trade, although [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&O]] also tried to take a share.<ref>{{cite book|page=103|last=Harcourt|first=Freda|title=Flagships of Imperialism: The P & O Company and the Politics of Empire from Its Origins to 1867 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HmMLqQXmIkMC&pg=PA103|year=2006|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-1-84779-145-0}}</ref> A [[Second Opium War]] fought by Britain and France against China lasted from 1856 until 1860 and led to the [[Treaty of Tientsin]], which legalised the importation of opium.

The [[Bengal famine of 1770]], in which one-third of the local population died, caused distress in Britain. Military and administrative costs mounted beyond control in British-administered regions in Bengal because of the ensuing drop in labour productivity.\n\nAt the same time, there was commercial stagnation and trade depression throughout Europe. The directors of the company attempted to avert bankruptcy by appealing to Parliament for financial help. This led to the passing of the [[Tea Act]] in 1773, which gave the company greater autonomy in running its trade in the American colonies, and allowed it an exemption from tea import duties which its colonial competitors were required to pay.\n\nWhen the American colonists and tea merchants were told of this Act, they boycotted the company tea. Although the price of tea had dropped because of the Act, it also validated the [[Townshend Acts]], setting the precedent for the king to impose additional taxes in the future. The arrival of tax-exempt Company tea, undercutting the local merchants, triggered the [[Boston Tea Party]] in the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], one of the major events leading up to the [[American Revolution]].\n\n=== Regulating Acts of Parliament ===\n\n==== East India Company Act 1773 ====\nBy the [[Regulating Act of 1773]] (later known as the East India Company Act 1773), the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] imposed a series of administrative and economic reforms; this clearly established Parliament's sovereignty and ultimate control over the company. The Act recognised the company's political functions and clearly established that the \"[[acquisition of sovereignty]] by the subjects of the Crown is on behalf of the Crown and not in its own right\".\n\n[[File:Nawab Mubarak al-Daula of Murshidabad (1770-93) enthroned in durbar.jpg|thumb|Nawab [[Mubarak Ali Khan (Nawab of Bengal)|Mubarak Ali Khan]] with his son in the Nawab's ''[[Durbar (court)|Durbar]]'' with [[British Resident]], Sir [[Sir John D'Oyly, 6th Baronet|John Hadley]]]]\n\nDespite stiff resistance from the East India lobby in Parliament and from the company's shareholders, the Act passed. It introduced substantial governmental control and allowed British India to be formally under the control of the Crown, but leased back to the company at \u00a340,000 for two years. Under the Act's most important provision, a governing Council composed of five members was created in Calcutta. The three members nominated by Parliament and representing the government's interest could, and invariably would, outvote the two Company members. The Council was headed by [[Warren Hastings]], the incumbent governor, who became the first [[governor-general of Bengal]], with an ill-defined authority over the Bombay and Madras Presidencies.<ref>Keay, John (1991). ''The Honourable Company: A History of the English East India Company''. Macmillan Publishing Company, New York p. 385.</ref> His nomination, made by the Court of Directors, would in future be subject to the approval of a [[Council of Four from India|Council of Four]] appointed by the Crown.

British judges and magistrates would also be sent to India to administer the legal system. The governor-general and the council would have complete legislative powers. The company was allowed to maintain its virtual monopoly over trade in exchange for the biennial sum and was obligated to export a minimum quantity of goods yearly to Britain. The costs of administration were to be met by the company. The company initially welcomed these provisions, but the annual burden of the payment contributed to the steady decline of its finances.<ref name=\"Anthony, Frank Pages 18- 19\" />\n\n==== East India Company Act 1784 (Pitt's India Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe East India Company Act 1784 ([[Pitt's India Act]]) had two key aspects:\n* Relationship to the British government: the bill differentiated the East India Company's political functions from its commercial activities. In political matters the East India Company was subordinated to the British government directly. To accomplish this, the Act created a [[India Board|Board of Commissioners for the Affairs of India]], usually referred to as the Board of Control. The members of the Board were the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], the [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]], and four [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Councillors]], nominated by the King. The act specified that the Secretary of State \"shall preside at, and be [[President of the Board of Control|President of the said Board]]\".\n* Internal Administration of British India: the bill laid the foundation for the centralised and bureaucratic British administration of India which would reach its peak at the beginning of the 20th century during the governor-generalship of [[George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Baron Curzon]].\n\nPitt's Act was deemed a failure because it quickly became apparent that the boundaries between government control and the company's powers were nebulous and highly subjective. The government felt obliged to respond to humanitarian calls for better treatment of local peoples in British-occupied territories. [[Edmund Burke]], a former East India Company shareholder and diplomat, was moved to address the situation and introduced a new Regulating Bill in 1783. The bill was defeated amid lobbying by company loyalists and accusations of nepotism in the bill's recommendations for the appointment of councillors.\n\n==== Act of 1786 ====\n[[File:Surrender of Tipu Sultan.jpg|thumb|General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]], receiving two of [[Tipu Sultan]]'s sons as hostages in the year 1793]]\n\nThe Act of 1786 (26 Geo. 3 c. 16) enacted the demand of [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Earl Cornwallis]] that the powers of the governor-general be enlarged to empower him, in special cases, to override the majority of his Council and act on his own special responsibility. The Act enabled the offices of the governor-general and the commander-in-chief to be jointly held by the same official.\n\nThis Act clearly demarcated borders between the Crown and the company. After this point, the company functioned as a regularised subsidiary of the Crown, with greater accountability for its actions and reached a stable stage of expansion and consolidation. Having temporarily achieved a state of truce with the Crown, the company continued to expand its influence to nearby territories through threats and coercive actions. By the middle of the 19th century, the company's rule extended across most of India, [[British rule in Burma|Burma]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]], and [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], and a fifth of the world's population was under its trading influence. In addition, [[Penang Island]], ceded from the [[Kedah Sultanate]] in Malaya, became the fourth most important settlement, a presidency, of the company's Indian territories.<ref>Langdon, Marcus; [http://arecabooks.com/product/penang-the-fourth-presidency-of-india-vol-1/ \"Penang: The Fourth Presidency of India 1805\u20131830, Volume One: Ships, Men and Mansions\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703023731/http://arecabooks.com/product/penang-the-fourth-presidency-of-india-vol-1/ |date=3 July 2014 }}, Areca Books, 2013. {{ISBN|978-967-5719-07-3}}</ref>\n\n==== East India Company Act 1793 (Charter Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe company's charter was renewed for a further 20&nbsp;years by the [[Charter Act of 1793]]. In contrast with the legislative proposals of the previous two decades, the 1793 Act was not a particularly controversial measure, and made only minimal changes to the system of government in India and to British oversight of the company's activities. Sale of liquor was forbidden without licence. It was pointed that the payment of the staff of the board of council should not be made from the Indian revenue.\n\n==== East India Company Act 1813 (Charter Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Major-General the Hon.

The Indian princes had become vassals of the company. But the expense of wars leading to the total control of India strained the company's finances. The company was forced to petition Parliament for assistance. This was the background to the [[Charter Act of 1813]] which, among other things:\n* asserted the sovereignty of the British Crown over the Indian territories held by the company;\n* renewed the charter of the company for a further twenty years, but\n** deprived the company of its Indian trade monopoly except for trade in tea and the trade with China\n** required the company to maintain separate and distinct its commercial and territorial accounts\n* opened India to missionaries\n\n==== Government of India Act 1833 ====\nThe Industrial Revolution in Britain, the consequent search for markets, and the rise of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic ideology form the background to the [[Saint Helena Act 1833|Government of India Act 1833]] (3 & 4 Will. 4 c. 85). The Act:\n* removed the company's remaining trade monopolies and divested it of all its commercial functions\n* renewed for another twenty years the company's political and administrative authority\n* invested the Board of Control with full power and authority over the company.

The site is now occupied by the [[Lloyd's building]].\n\nIn 1607, the company decided to build its own ships and leased a yard on the [[River Thames]] at [[Deptford]]. By 1614, the yard having become too small, an alternative site was acquired at [[Blackwall Yard|Blackwall]]: the new yard was fully operational by 1617. It was sold in 1656, although for some years East India Company ships continued to be built and repaired there under the new owners.\n\nIn 1803, an Act of Parliament, promoted by the East India Company, established the East India Dock Company, with the aim of establishing a new set of docks (the [[East India Docks]]) primarily for the use of ships trading with India. The existing Brunswick Dock, part of the Blackwall Yard site, became the Export Dock; while a new Import Dock was built to the north. In 1838 the East India Dock Company merged with the [[West India Docks|West India Dock Company]]. The docks were taken over by the [[Port of London Authority]] in 1909, and closed in 1967.\n\n[[File:Addiscombe Seminary photo c.1859.jpg|thumb|left|[[Addiscombe Military Seminary|Addiscombe Seminary]], photographed in ''c''.1859, with cadets in the foreground]]\n\nThe [[East India Company College|East India College]] was founded in 1806 as a training establishment for \"writers\" (i.e. clerks) in the company's service. It was initially located in [[Hertford Castle]], but moved in 1809 to purpose-built premises at [[Hertford Heath]], Hertfordshire. In 1858 the college closed; but in 1862 the buildings reopened as a [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]], now [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College]].\n\nThe [[Addiscombe Military Seminary|East India Company Military Seminary]] was founded in 1809 at [[Addiscombe]], near [[Croydon]], Surrey, to train young officers for service in the company's armies in India. It was based in Addiscombe Place, an early 18th-century mansion. The government took it over in 1858, and renamed it the Royal Indian Military College. In 1861 it was closed, and the site was subsequently redeveloped.\n\nIn 1818, the company entered into an agreement by which those of its servants who were certified insane in India might be cared for at Pembroke House, [[Hackney (parish)|Hackney]], London, a private [[History of psychiatric institutions|lunatic asylum]] run by Dr George Rees until 1838, and thereafter by Dr William Williams. The arrangement outlasted the company itself, continuing until 1870, when the India Office opened its own asylum, the [[Hanwell#Healthcare|Royal India Asylum]], at [[Hanwell]], Middlesex.<ref>Farrington 1976, pp. 125\u2013132.</ref><ref>{{cite book |first1=Diane K. |last1=Bolton |first2=Patricia E.

Although dissolved by the [[East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act 1873]] following the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|rebellion of 1857]], it stimulated the growth of the [[British Empire]]. Its professionally trained armies rose to dominate the sub-continent and were to become the armies of British India after 1857. It played a key role in introducing English as an official language in India. This also led to [[Macaulayism]] in the Indian subcontinent.\n[[File:Panorama of a durbar procession of Akbar II (Retouched).jpg|thumb|Panorama of a [[Durbar (court)|durbar]] procession of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Akbar II]], 1806-37. The Emperor is followed by the British Resident.]]\nOnce the East India Company took over Bengal in the [[treaty of Allahabad]] (1765) it collected taxes which it used to further its expansion to the rest of India and did not have to rely on venture capital from London. It returned a high profit to those who risked original money for earlier ventures into Bengal.\n\nDuring the first century of the East India Company's expansion in India, most people in India lived under regional kings or Nawabs. By the late 18th century many Moghuls were weak in comparison to the rapidly expanding Company as it took over cities and land, built railways, roads and bridges. The first railway of 21 mile (33.8&nbsp;km),<ref>Rao, M.A. (1988). ''Indian Railways'', New Delhi: National Book Trust, p.15</ref> known as the [[Great Indian Peninsula Railway]] ran between Bombay (Mumbai) and Tannah (Thane) in 1849. The Company sought quick profits because the financial backers in England took high risks: their money for possible profits or losses through shipwrecks, wars or calamities.\n\nThe increasingly large territory the Company was annexing and collecting taxes was also run by the local Nawabs. In essence, it was a dual administration. Between 1765 and 1772 [[Robert Clive]] gave the responsibility of tax collecting, [[diwani]], to the Indian deputy and judicial and police responsibilities to other Indian deputies. The Company concentrated its new power of collecting revenue and left the responsibilities to the Indian agencies. The East India Company took the beginning steps of British takeover of power in India for centuries to come. In 1772, the Company made [[Warren Hastings]], who had been in India with the Company since 1750, its first governor-general to manage and overview all of the annexed lands. The dual administration system came to an end.\n\nHastings learned Urdu and Persian and took great interest in preserving ancient Sanskrit manuscripts and having them translated into English. He employed many Indians as officials.<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Suijk, Paul (Director) | date=2015 | title=The British East India Company | trans-title = The Great Courses (Episode 24,19:11) | medium=on-line video | location=Brentwood Associates/The Teaching Company Sales.

This is still used in Pakistani and Bangladeshi courts today in civil law. Hastings also annexed lands and kingdoms and enriched himself in the process.

Cornwallis distrusted Indians and replaced Indians with Englishmen. He introduced a system of personal land ownership for Indians.

With the [[Acts of Union 1707]], the canton was changed to the new [[Evolution of UK Flag|Union Flag]]\u2014consisting of an English St George's Cross combined with a Scottish [[Flag of Scotland|St Andrew's cross]]\u2014representing the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. After the [[Acts of Union 1800]] that joined Ireland with Great Britain to form the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], the canton of the East India Company flag was altered accordingly to include a [[Saint Patrick's Saltire]].\n\nThere has been much debate about the number and order of stripes in the field of the flag.

This was not so that they could carry cannon to fend off warships, privateers, and pirates on their voyages to India and China (that they could do without permission) but so that, should they have the opportunity to take a prize, they could do so without being guilty of piracy. Similarly, the ''Earl of Mornington'', an East India Company [[packet ship]] of only six guns, also sailed under a letter of marque.\n\nIn addition, the company had its own navy, the [[History of the Indian Navy|Bombay Marine]], equipped with warships such as {{ship|HCS|Grappler|1804|2}}. These vessels often accompanied vessels of the Royal Navy on expeditions, such as the [[Invasion of Java (1811)|Invasion of Java]].\n\nAt the [[Battle of Pulo Aura]], which was probably the company's most notable naval victory, [[Nathaniel Dance]], Commodore of a convoy of Indiamen and sailing aboard the {{ship||Warley|1796 ship|2}}, led several Indiamen in a skirmish with a French squadron, driving them off. Some six years earlier, on 28 January 1797, five Indiamen, the ''Woodford'', under Captain Charles Lennox, the ''Taunton-Castle'', Captain Edward Studd, ''Canton'', Captain Abel Vyvyan, ''Boddam'', Captain George Palmer, and {{ship||Ocean|1788 EIC ship|2}}, Captain John Christian Lochner, had encountered Admiral [[Pierre C\u00e9sar Charles de Sercey|de Sercey]] and his squadron of frigates. On this occasion the Indiamen also succeeded in bluffing their way to safety, and without any shots even being fired. Lastly, on 15 June 1795, the ''General Goddard'' played a large role in the capture of seven Dutch East Indiamen off [[Saint Helena|St Helena]].\n\n[[East Indiamen]] were large and strongly built and when the [[Royal Navy]] was desperate for vessels to escort merchant convoys it bought several of them to convert to warships. ''Earl of Mornington'' became HMS ''Drake''.
