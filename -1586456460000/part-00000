Originally serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' from 1987 to 2004, it was transferred to the monthly [[seinen|''seinen'' manga]] magazine ''[[Ultra Jump]]'' in 2005. The plot of the series is divided into eight story arcs, each following the adventures of a new protagonist bearing the \"JoJo\" nickname; the eighth part, ''[[JoJolion]]'', began serialization in May 2011. The series is currently [[Shueisha]]'s second [[List of manga series by volume count|largest manga series by volume count]], with its chapters collected in 126 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes as of December 2019.\n\nA [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (1993 anime series)|13-episode original video animation series]] adapting the manga's third part, ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'', was produced by [[A.P.P.P.]] and released between 1993 and 2002.{{efn|Seven episodes adapting the latter half of the part were released between 1993 and 1994; six more episodes adapting the first half were released between 2000 and 2002.}} The studio later produced [[Phantom Blood#Release and related media|an anime film]] adaptation of the first part in the series, ''[[Phantom Blood]]'', which was released in Japanese theaters in 2007. In October 2012, an [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012 TV series)|anime television series adaptation]] produced by [[David Production]] began broadcast on [[Tokyo MX]]. The studio has since adapted through the series' fifth part, ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'', which ended broadcast in July 2019. A [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable Chapter I|live-action film]] directed by [[Takashi Miike]] and based on the fourth part, ''[[Diamond is Unbreakable]]'', entered theaters in 2017.\n\n''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' is famous for its iconic art style and poses, frequent references to Western [[popular music]] and [[fashion]], and creative battles centered around [[#Supernatural powers|Stands]], psycho-spiritual manifestations possessing unique supernatural abilities. The series has sold over 100 million copies in print to date, making it one of the [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history, and it has spawned a [[media franchise]] including [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot manga]], spin-off [[light novel]]s, [[List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure video games|video games]], [[model figure|action figures]], and lines of apparel. The manga, TV anime, and live-action film are licensed in North America by [[Viz Media]], which has produced various English-language releases of the series since 2005. Trish hentai\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure characters}}\nEach of the series' eight protagonists is a member of the {{Nihongo|Joestar family|\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u5bb6|J\u014dsut\u0101 ke}}, whose mainline descendants invariably possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular \"JoJo\". The plot of each part generally consists of this JoJo gathering a group of allies, mastering their supernatural ability, battling various enemies, and ultimately confronting the part's powerful main villain. The first six parts of the series take place within a single continuity whose multi-generational conflict stems from the rivalry between [[Jonathan Joestar]] and [[Dio Brando]], while the latter two parts take place in an alternate universe following a continuity reboot, where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.\n\n; Part 1<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Phantom Blood]]''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9|Fantomu Buraddo}}\n:Volumes 1\u20135, 44 chapters. In late 19th-century [[England]], the young Jonathan Joestar meets his new adopted brother [[Dio Brando]], who only wants to usurp Jonathan as heir to the Joestar family. However, his attempts are thwarted and he resorts to using an ancient Stone Mask which transforms him into a vampire. Jonathan, with Italian [[#Supernatural powers|Hamon]] master Will A. Zeppeli and former street thug Robert E.O. Speedwagon at his side, uses his newly found affinity for Hamon to stop Dio whose sights are set on nothing less than world domination. With this Hamon, Jonathan has discovered the only power that can kill a Vampire, and thus is especially necessary in his rivalry against Dio, who has tormented him his whole life.\n\n; Part 2<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Battle Tendency]]''|\u6226\u95d8\u6f6e\u6d41|Sent\u014d Ch\u014dry\u016b}}\n:Volumes 5\u201312, 69 chapters. In [[New York City]] in 1938, Joseph Joestar, grandson of Jonathan, has a natural affinity for Hamon. After hearing of Speedwagon's supposed death during an excavation, Joseph decides to investigate and becomes entangled with the revival of the Pillar Men, ancient humanoids of impossible power who are tied to the creation of the Stone Mask. Joseph ultimately teams up with Caesar Zeppeli, Will's grandson, and Caesar's teacher Lisa Lisa, who is mysteriously tied to Joseph. Under the pressure of poisons implanted in Joseph's body, Joseph must master Hamon as they try to stop the Pillar Men from obtaining the Red Stone of Aja, a mystical artifact in Lisa Lisa's possession that will grant them immortality and bring about the end of the world at their hands.\n\n; Part 3<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stardust Crusaders]]''|\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c0\u30b9\u30c8\u30af\u30eb\u30bb\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9|Sut\u0101dasuto Kuruseid\u0101su}}\n:Volumes 13\u201328, 152 chapters. In 1989, Jotaro Kujo, a Japanese high school student, places himself in jail because he believes he is possessed by an evil spirit. His mother Holly calls on her father Joseph Joestar to talk sense into Jotaro. With the help of his ally the Egyptian fortune teller Mohammed Avdol, Joseph reveals that Jotaro has in fact developed a supernatural ability known as a [[#Supernatural powers|Stand]] that has run through the family due to a newly resurfaced Dio Brando having fused his head to Jonathan Joestar's headless body. After thwarting an assassination attempt by transfer student Noriaki Kakyoin, who is under Dio's thrall, Jotaro and Joseph discover that Holly is dying from her own Stand. Jotaro resolves to hunt down Dio, and Joseph leads him, Avdol, and Kakyoin to Egypt, using their Stands to battle more Stand-wielding assassins along the way before 50 days elapse and Holly dies. As they progress, they gain allies in the French swordsman Jean Pierre Polnareff, who wishes to avenge the death of his sister, and the [[Boston Terrier]] Iggy, who begrudgingly accompanies the group on the way to Cairo to bring about the demise of Dio that was due one hundred years prior.\n\n; Part 4<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]''|\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u306f\u7815\u3051\u306a\u3044|Daiyamondo wa Kudakenai}}\n:Volumes 29\u201347, 174 chapters. In the fictional Japanese town of Morioh in 1999, Jotaro arrives to tell Josuke Higashikata (the kanji {{lang|ja|\u52a9}} in his name is read in the ''[[on'yomi]]'' form as ''jo'') that he is the illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar and to warn him that Morioh is becoming filled with Stand users. This is due to a mystical Bow and Arrow that bestows Stands on those struck by the arrowheads. After Josuke takes revenge on a Stand user who killed his grandfather, he agrees to help Jotaro hunt down the holder of the Bow and Arrow. He gains allies in Josuke's friend Koichi Hirose, who is hit by the arrow; Okuyasu Nijimura, whose brother Keicho was using the Arrow until it was stolen from him; Rohan Kishibe, a famous manga artist; and even his estranged father Joseph Joestar. Along the way, the group deals with the various new Stand users throughout Morioh, including several of Josuke, Koichi, and Okuyasu's classmates. Eventually, the death of one of their friends leads to the discovery that one of the new Stand users is the serial killer, Yoshikage Kira.\n\n; Part 5<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]''|\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u98a8|\u014cgon no Kaze}}\n:Volumes 47\u201363, 155 chapters. In 2001, Koichi Hirose is sent by Jotaro to [[Naples]] to investigate Giorno Giovanna, whom Jotaro has discovered is Dio's son fathered via Jonathan's body before his defeat in Cairo 12 years earlier, to see if the boy has a Stand and if he is evil. Koichi ultimately discovers Giorno's Stand and his pure goals for reforming a mafia organization from the inside out, and Jotaro lets him live his life uninterrupted. Giorno ultimately joins Bruno Bucciarati's squad within Passione, a Stand-using mafia, who leads Giorno, Leone Abbacchio, Guido Mista, Narancia Ghirga, and Pannacotta Fugo on a mission to [[Capri]] to retrieve Bruno's former superior's riches. In addition to being attacked by rival mafioso along the way, they are then tasked by Passione's boss to escort his daughter Trish Una throughout Italy and protect her from others in the gang who wish to use her to find out the boss's identity.\n\n; Part 6<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stone Ocean]]''|\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u30aa\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3|Sut\u014dn \u014cshan}}\n:Volumes 64\u201380, 158 chapters. In 2011 near [[Port St. Lucie, Florida]], Jolyne Cujoh is arrested and sent to the Green Dolphin St. Prison for murder. Her estranged father Jotaro visits her and reveals that she has been set up in order for one of Dio's disciples to kill her within the prison. After revealing that a gift he gave her has awoken her latent Stand powers to protect her, Jotaro is attacked, and his Stand and memories are stolen from him by the prison chaplain Enrico Pucci, Dio's disciple. Jolyne works with fellow inmate Ermes Costello, who has also had a Stand awoken in her, to retrieve her father's Stand, gaining allies in the boy Emporio Alni\u00f1o; fellow inmates Narciso Anasui and Weather Report; and the sentient Stand-using plankton colony \u201cFoo Fighters\u201d to save her father and stop Pucci before he can use his Stand to recreate the universe in Dio's image.\n\n; Part 7<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Steel Ball Run]]''|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3|Sut\u012bru B\u014dru Ran}}\n:Volumes 81\u2013104, 95 chapters. In an alternate timeline in 1890, Gyro Zeppeli travels to the United States to take part in a cross-country horse race known as the Steel Ball Run. His skill in a mystical martial art known as Spin, which he controls with steel balls, garners the interest of former jockey turned paraplegic Johnny Joestar, particularly after a Spin-infused ball briefly restores Johnny's ability to walk. Johnny travels with Gyro on the race to learn the art of Spin from him in hopes he can walk again, but they soon discover that the race is a ploy set up by Funny Valentine, the President of the United States, to search the country for the scattered parts of a holy corpse that imbue their holders with a Stand, so the President can use the entire corpse to his own patriotic ends, even if it means the disruption of other dimensions with his Stand's ability. Gyro and Johnny work together, along with fellow racers Mountain Tim and Hot Pants, and race organizer Stephen Steel and his wife Lucy, to stop the President from achieving his plans, as they threaten the very world, all while dealing with Valentine's hired assassins in the race, including the charismatic racer Diego Brando.\n\n; Part 8<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[JoJolion]]''|\u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|Jojorion}}\n:Volumes 105\u2013126, 93 chapters. In 2012, in the same universe as ''Steel Ball Run'', the town of Morioh has been devastated by the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], which has caused mysterious faults colloquially known as the \"Wall Eyes\" to appear in town. Local college student Yasuho Hirose is near one of the Wall Eyes when she discovers a young man buried in the rubble and a strange bite mark on him. She nicknames him \"Josuke\", as he cannot remember his own name, and after following a lead that he may be \"Yoshikage Kira\", an attack by a Stand user leads them to find the real Yoshikage Kira's corpse. Josuke is put in the care of the Higashikata family, whose patriarch Norisuke IV seems to know more about Josuke than he initially lets on, but Josuke himself discovers that the Higashikata family and Yoshikage Kira's family are linked due to Johnny Joestar's marriage to Rina Higashikata in the late 19th century. Josuke and Yasuho ultimately discover that Josuke is in fact Yoshikage Kira, mysteriously fused with another person, and Yoshikage Kira possessed the knowledge to cure a curse that has plagued the Higashikata family for centuries. Norisuke IV wants that knowledge back to save his grandchild from the same fate he and his family has suffered, but a mysterious race of rock men and Norisuke IV's own son Jobin seem to be conspiring against them to both prevent Josuke from regaining his memories and from lifting the curse on the Higashikata family.\n\n==Supernatural powers==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n* {{anchor|Hamon}} '''Part 1:''' ''[[Phantom Blood]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Stone Mask|\u77f3\u4eee\u9762|Ishikamen}}, an artifact discovered in Aztec ruins that reacts when blood is spilled on it, the Stone Mask produces spikes that drive themselves into the wearer's skull, transforming them into an immortal {{nihongo|[[Vampire]]|\u5438\u8840\u9b3c|Ky\u016bketsuki}}. These Vampires drain people of blood, can heal from most injuries, combine other creatures into abominations and freeze objects. A Vampire can only be killed by destroying the head, or by exposure to natural sunlight or ultraviolet rays. The {{nihongo|Ripple|\u6ce2\u7d0b|Hamon}} is also introduced as a martial arts technique that allows the user to focus bodily energy via controlled breathing. It is effective in combating vampires, as experienced Ripple users can emulate sunlight. Such energy is also useful in combating {{nihongo|Zombies|{{ruby-ja|\u5c4d\u751f\u4eba|\u30be\u30f3\u30d3}}|Zonbi|also referred to as {{nihongo|\"Undead\"|{{ruby-ja|\u4ea1\u8005|\u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9}}|Andeddo}}}} created by vampires.\n* '''Part 2:''' ''[[Battle Tendency]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Pillar Men|\u67f1\u306e\u7537|Hashira no Otoko}}, ancient humanoids whose superhuman abilities enabled them to thrive as apex predators. One of their members, Kars, created the Stone Masks in an attempt to find a way to bypass their species' weakness to sunlight so they may rule Earth. When they are exposed to sunlight, they turn to stone, thus making them susceptible to the energies of the Ripple. Their surviving members seek out the {{nihongo|Red Stone of Aja|\u30a8\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u306e\u8d64\u77f3|Eija no Sekiseki}}, a flawless gem that amplifies light into nearly laser precision which is able to perfect the transformation into an immortal being with control over all life's forces. It is for this reason that the Ripple users protect the flawless Super Aja so it will not fall into the hands of the Pillar Men.\n* {{anchor|Stands}} '''Part 3:''' ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'' introduces an evolution of the Ripple concept, {{nihongo|Stands|{{ruby-ja|\u5e7d\u6ce2\u7d0b|\u3086\u3046\u306f\u3082\u3093}}|Y\u016bhamon|literally \"Ghost (or Spirit) Ripple\", pronounced in the series as the English {{nihongo|\"Stand\"|\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9|Sutando}}}}, so named because they are the manifestation of the user's psychic powers, or what would be their Ripple, in the form of a spiritual familiar that stands with them. A person may obtain a Stand naturally at birth, through rigorous spiritual and/or Ripple training, through exceptionally strong willpower, desire and/or passion, or through inheritance from bloodline. A Stand may never manifest itself until it is amplified by certain conditions or factors and not everyone has the ability to control it. Some Stands appear to have a separate and autonomous personality from their users, able to act on their own to protect them or speak to them. Generally, if the Stand user is incapacitated, the Stand will no longer be a threat (with an exception in Part 5), and any damage to a stand will be reflected on its user, and vice versa.\n* '''Part 4:''' ''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]'' introduces a {{nihongo|Bow and Arrow|\u5f13\u3068\u77e2|Yumi to Ya}}, forged from a mysterious meteorite that made its way to Earth after being drawn in by the spiritual powers of the planet's inhabitants. A Stand can be brought forth after one is pierced by the Arrow; however, the results can be unpredictable, as it could easily kill an unqualified person, and there is no apparent way to know if a person is qualified ahead of time. The Arrows do, however, tend to seek out qualified people on their own if there is someone to guide them.\n* '''Part 5:''' ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'' introduces the ability to create a {{nihongo|\"Requiem\"|{{ruby-ja|\u93ae\u9b42\u6b4c|\u30ec\u30af\u30a4\u30a8\u30e0}}|Rekuiemu}} Stand. If an Arrow hits the Stand instead of the user, the Stand can completely change form and its powers become a Requiem Stand with increased powers that relate to the control over the souls of living beings. Both Giorno's Gold Experience and Polnareff's Silver Chariot are pierced by the Arrow and given Requiem forms. Silver Chariot Requiem's new ability swaps the souls of all living beings, and Gold Experience Requiem's new ability removes the consequences of any action, reverting it to a null state.\n* '''Part 6:''' ''[[Stone Ocean]]'' shows examples of a single person possessing two Stands because of the ability of an extraordinary Stand. Enrico Pucci is able to produce artificial Stand users by stealing others' Stands, transforming them into {{nihongo|Discs|\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af|Disuku}}, and \"inserting\" them into certain individuals. Part 6 also features {{nihongo|DIO's bone|{{ruby-ja|DIO|\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa}}\u306e\u9aa8|DIO no Hone}}, the sole remaining part of DIO which is instrumental in Pucci's {{nihongo|Way to Heaven|\u5929\u56fd\u3078\u884c\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5|Tengoku e Iku H\u014dh\u014d}}. It grants a new and more powerful Stand that ultimately leads to the creation of {{nihongo|Made in Heaven|\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30d8\u30d6\u30f3|Meido In Hebun}}, a powerful Stand that can accelerate the universe to the point of a universal reset in accordance with the [[Big Bounce|Big Bounce cosmological model]].\n* '''Part 7:''' ''[[Steel Ball Run]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Spin|\u56de\u8ee2|Kaiten}}, a technique that incorporates the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]], [[golden spiral]], and {{nihongo|[[golden rectangle]]|\u9ec4\u91d1\u9577\u65b9\u5f62|\u014dgon ch\u014dh\u014dkei}} into a means of manipulating the [[Magnus effect]] to the user's benefit, but its true power lies in its destructive effects. Also introduced in Part 7 is the {{nihongo|Saint's Corpse|\u8056\u4eba\u306e\u907a\u4f53|Seijin no Itai}}, body parts of a deceased holy man (hinted to be [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]) that imbue the user with a Stand if the body part is fused with the user. If the user loses the Corpse part, they lose their Stand.\n* '''Part 8:''' ''[[JoJolion]]'' introduces another method of obtaining a Stand, interaction with the {{nihongo|Wall Eyes|\u58c1\u306e\u76ee|Kabe no Me}}, strange [[fault (geology)|fault]]-like structures that have risen from the ground following the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. They disrupt all forms of transportation, communication, and utilities, but all users of Stands have come in contact with the Wall Eyes at some point.

Originally serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' from 1987 to 2004, it was transferred to the monthly [[seinen|''seinen'' manga]] magazine ''[[Ultra Jump]]'' in 2005. The plot of the series is divided into eight story arcs, each following the adventures of a new protagonist bearing the \"JoJo\" nickname; the eighth part, ''[[JoJolion]]'', began serialization in May 2011. The series is currently [[Shueisha]]'s second [[List of manga series by volume count|largest manga series by volume count]], with its chapters collected in 126 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes as of December 2019.\n\nA [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (1993 anime series)|13-episode original video animation series]] adapting the manga's third part, ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'', was produced by [[A.P.P.P.]] and released between 1993 and 2002.{{efn|Seven episodes adapting the latter half of the part were released between 1993 and 1994; six more episodes adapting the first half were released between 2000 and 2002.}} The studio later produced [[Phantom Blood#Release and related media|an anime film]] adaptation of the first part in the series, ''[[Phantom Blood]]'', which was released in Japanese theaters in 2007. In October 2012, an [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012 TV series)|anime television series adaptation]] produced by [[David Production]] began broadcast on [[Tokyo MX]]. The studio has since adapted through the series' fifth part, ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'', which ended broadcast in July 2019. A [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable Chapter I|live-action film]] directed by [[Takashi Miike]] and based on the fourth part, ''[[Diamond is Unbreakable]]'', entered theaters in 2017.\n\n''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' is famous for its iconic art style and poses, frequent references to Western [[popular music]] and [[fashion]], and creative battles centered around [[#Supernatural powers|Stands]], psycho-spiritual manifestations possessing unique supernatural abilities. The series has sold over 100 million copies in print to date, making it one of the [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history, and it has spawned a [[media franchise]] including [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot manga]], spin-off [[light novel]]s, [[List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure video games|video games]], [[model figure|action figures]], and lines of apparel. The manga, TV anime, and live-action film are licensed in North America by [[Viz Media]], which has produced various English-language releases of the series since 2005.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure characters}}\nEach of the series' eight protagonists is a member of the {{Nihongo|Joestar family|\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u5bb6|J\u014dsut\u0101 ke}}, whose mainline descendants invariably possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular \"JoJo\". The plot of each part generally consists of this JoJo gathering a group of allies, mastering their supernatural ability, battling various enemies, and ultimately confronting the part's powerful main villain. The first six parts of the series take place within a single continuity whose multi-generational conflict stems from the rivalry between [[Jonathan Joestar]] and [[Dio Brando]], while the latter two parts take place in an alternate universe following a continuity reboot, where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.\n\n; Part 1<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Phantom Blood]]''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9|Fantomu Buraddo}}\n:Volumes 1\u20135, 44 chapters. In late 19th-century [[England]], the young Jonathan Joestar meets his new adopted brother [[Dio Brando]], who only wants to usurp Jonathan as heir to the Joestar family. However, his attempts are thwarted and he resorts to using an ancient Stone Mask which transforms him into a vampire. Jonathan, with Italian [[#Supernatural powers|Hamon]] master Will A. Zeppeli and former street thug Robert E.O. Speedwagon at his side, uses his newly found affinity for Hamon to stop Dio whose sights are set on nothing less than world domination. With this Hamon, Jonathan has discovered the only power that can kill a Vampire, and thus is especially necessary in his rivalry against Dio, who has tormented him his whole life.\n\n; Part 2<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Battle Tendency]]''|\u6226\u95d8\u6f6e\u6d41|Sent\u014d Ch\u014dry\u016b}}\n:Volumes 5\u201312, 69 chapters. In [[New York City]] in 1938, Joseph Joestar, grandson of Jonathan, has a natural affinity for Hamon. After hearing of Speedwagon's supposed death during an excavation, Joseph decides to investigate and becomes entangled with the revival of the Pillar Men, ancient humanoids of impossible power who are tied to the creation of the Stone Mask. Joseph ultimately teams up with Caesar Zeppeli, Will's grandson, and Caesar's teacher Lisa Lisa, who is mysteriously tied to Joseph. Under the pressure of poisons implanted in Joseph's body, Joseph must master Hamon as they try to stop the Pillar Men from obtaining the Red Stone of Aja, a mystical artifact in Lisa Lisa's possession that will grant them immortality and bring about the end of the world at their hands.\n\n; Part 3<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stardust Crusaders]]''|\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c0\u30b9\u30c8\u30af\u30eb\u30bb\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9|Sut\u0101dasuto Kuruseid\u0101su}}\n:Volumes 13\u201328, 152 chapters. In 1989, Jotaro Kujo, a Japanese high school student, places himself in jail because he believes he is possessed by an evil spirit. His mother Holly calls on her father Joseph Joestar to talk sense into Jotaro. With the help of his ally the Egyptian fortune teller Mohammed Avdol, Joseph reveals that Jotaro has in fact developed a supernatural ability known as a [[#Supernatural powers|Stand]] that has run through the family due to a newly resurfaced Dio Brando having fused his head to Jonathan Joestar's headless body. After thwarting an assassination attempt by transfer student Noriaki Kakyoin, who is under Dio's thrall, Jotaro and Joseph discover that Holly is dying from her own Stand. Jotaro resolves to hunt down Dio, and Joseph leads him, Avdol, and Kakyoin to Egypt, using their Stands to battle more Stand-wielding assassins along the way before 50 days elapse and Holly dies. As they progress, they gain allies in the French swordsman Jean Pierre Polnareff, who wishes to avenge the death of his sister, and the [[Boston Terrier]] Iggy, who begrudgingly accompanies the group on the way to Cairo to bring about the demise of Dio that was due one hundred years prior.\n\n; Part 4<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]''|\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u306f\u7815\u3051\u306a\u3044|Daiyamondo wa Kudakenai}}\n:Volumes 29\u201347, 174 chapters. In the fictional Japanese town of Morioh in 1999, Jotaro arrives to tell Josuke Higashikata (the kanji {{lang|ja|\u52a9}} in his name is read in the ''[[on'yomi]]'' form as ''jo'') that he is the illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar and to warn him that Morioh is becoming filled with Stand users. This is due to a mystical Bow and Arrow that bestows Stands on those struck by the arrowheads. After Josuke takes revenge on a Stand user who killed his grandfather, he agrees to help Jotaro hunt down the holder of the Bow and Arrow. He gains allies in Josuke's friend Koichi Hirose, who is hit by the arrow; Okuyasu Nijimura, whose brother Keicho was using the Arrow until it was stolen from him; Rohan Kishibe, a famous manga artist; and even his estranged father Joseph Joestar. Along the way, the group deals with the various new Stand users throughout Morioh, including several of Josuke, Koichi, and Okuyasu's classmates. Eventually, the death of one of their friends leads to the discovery that one of the new Stand users is the serial killer, Yoshikage Kira.\n\n; Part 5<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]''|\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u98a8|\u014cgon no Kaze}}\n:Volumes 47\u201363, 155 chapters. In 2001, Koichi Hirose is sent by Jotaro to [[Naples]] to investigate Giorno Giovanna, whom Jotaro has discovered is Dio's son fathered via Jonathan's body before his defeat in Cairo 12 years earlier, to see if the boy has a Stand and if he is evil. Koichi ultimately discovers Giorno's Stand and his pure goals for reforming a mafia organization from the inside out, and Jotaro lets him live his life uninterrupted. Giorno ultimately joins Bruno Bucciarati's squad within Passione, a Stand-using mafia, who leads Giorno, Leone Abbacchio, Guido Mista, Narancia Ghirga, and Pannacotta Fugo on a mission to [[Capri]] to retrieve Bruno's former superior's riches. In addition to being attacked by rival mafioso along the way, they are then tasked by Passione's boss to escort his daughter Trish Una throughout Italy and protect her from others in the gang who wish to use her to find out the boss's identity.\n\n; Part 6<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stone Ocean]]''|\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u30aa\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3|Sut\u014dn \u014cshan}}\n:Volumes 64\u201380, 158 chapters.

Her estranged father Jotaro visits her and reveals that she has been set up in order for one of Dio's disciples to kill her within the prison. After revealing that a gift he gave her has awoken her latent Stand powers to protect her, Jotaro is attacked, and his Stand and memories are stolen from him by the prison chaplain Enrico Pucci, Dio's disciple. Jolyne works with fellow inmate Ermes Costello, who has also had a Stand awoken in her, to retrieve her father's Stand, gaining allies in the boy Emporio Alni\u00f1o; fellow inmates Narciso Anasui and Weather Report; and the sentient Stand-using plankton colony \u201cFoo Fighters\u201d to save her father and stop Pucci before he can use his Stand to recreate the universe in Dio's image.\n\n; Part 7<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Steel Ball Run]]''|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3|Sut\u012bru B\u014dru Ran}}\n:Volumes 81\u2013104, 95 chapters. In an alternate timeline in 1890, Gyro Zeppeli travels to the United States to take part in a cross-country horse race known as the Steel Ball Run. His skill in a mystical martial art known as Spin, which he controls with steel balls, garners the interest of former jockey turned paraplegic Johnny Joestar, particularly after a Spin-infused ball briefly restores Johnny's ability to walk. Johnny travels with Gyro on the race to learn the art of Spin from him in hopes he can walk again, but they soon discover that the race is a ploy set up by Funny Valentine, the President of the United States, to search the country for the scattered parts of a holy corpse that imbue their holders with a Stand, so the President can use the entire corpse to his own patriotic ends, even if it means the disruption of other dimensions with his Stand's ability. Gyro and Johnny work together, along with fellow racers Mountain Tim and Hot Pants, and race organizer Stephen Steel and his wife Lucy, to stop the President from achieving his plans, as they threaten the very world, all while dealing with Valentine's hired assassins in the race, including the charismatic racer Diego Brando.\n\n; Part 8<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[JoJolion]]''|\u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|Jojorion}}\n:Volumes 105\u2013126, 93 chapters. In 2012, in the same universe as ''Steel Ball Run'', the town of Morioh has been devastated by the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], which has caused mysterious faults colloquially known as the \"Wall Eyes\" to appear in town. Local college student Yasuho Hirose is near one of the Wall Eyes when she discovers a young man buried in the rubble and a strange bite mark on him. She nicknames him \"Josuke\", as he cannot remember his own name, and after following a lead that he may be \"Yoshikage Kira\", an attack by a Stand user leads them to find the real Yoshikage Kira's corpse. Josuke is put in the care of the Higashikata family, whose patriarch Norisuke IV seems to know more about Josuke than he initially lets on, but Josuke himself discovers that the Higashikata family and Yoshikage Kira's family are linked due to Johnny Joestar's marriage to Rina Higashikata in the late 19th century. Josuke and Yasuho ultimately discover that Josuke is in fact Yoshikage Kira, mysteriously fused with another person, and Yoshikage Kira possessed the knowledge to cure a curse that has plagued the Higashikata family for centuries. Norisuke IV wants that knowledge back to save his grandchild from the same fate he and his family has suffered, but a mysterious race of rock men and Norisuke IV's own son Jobin seem to be conspiring against them to both prevent Josuke from regaining his memories and from lifting the curse on the Higashikata family.\n\n==Supernatural powers==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n* {{anchor|Hamon}} '''Part 1:''' ''[[Phantom Blood]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Stone Mask|\u77f3\u4eee\u9762|Ishikamen}}, an artifact discovered in Aztec ruins that reacts when blood is spilled on it, the Stone Mask produces spikes that drive themselves into the wearer's skull, transforming them into an immortal {{nihongo|[[Vampire]]|\u5438\u8840\u9b3c|Ky\u016bketsuki}}. These Vampires drain people of blood, can heal from most injuries, combine other creatures into abominations and freeze objects. A Vampire can only be killed by destroying the head, or by exposure to natural sunlight or ultraviolet rays. The {{nihongo|Ripple|\u6ce2\u7d0b|Hamon}} is also introduced as a martial arts technique that allows the user to focus bodily energy via controlled breathing. It is effective in combating vampires, as experienced Ripple users can emulate sunlight. Such energy is also useful in combating {{nihongo|Zombies|{{ruby-ja|\u5c4d\u751f\u4eba|\u30be\u30f3\u30d3}}|Zonbi|also referred to as {{nihongo|\"Undead\"|{{ruby-ja|\u4ea1\u8005|\u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9}}|Andeddo}}}} created by vampires.\n* '''Part 2:''' ''[[Battle Tendency]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Pillar Men|\u67f1\u306e\u7537|Hashira no Otoko}}, ancient humanoids whose superhuman abilities enabled them to thrive as apex predators. One of their members, Kars, created the Stone Masks in an attempt to find a way to bypass their species' weakness to sunlight so they may rule Earth. When they are exposed to sunlight, they turn to stone, thus making them susceptible to the energies of the Ripple. Their surviving members seek out the {{nihongo|Red Stone of Aja|\u30a8\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u306e\u8d64\u77f3|Eija no Sekiseki}}, a flawless gem that amplifies light into nearly laser precision which is able to perfect the transformation into an immortal being with control over all life's forces. It is for this reason that the Ripple users protect the flawless Super Aja so it will not fall into the hands of the Pillar Men.\n* {{anchor|Stands}} '''Part 3:''' ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'' introduces an evolution of the Ripple concept, {{nihongo|Stands|{{ruby-ja|\u5e7d\u6ce2\u7d0b|\u3086\u3046\u306f\u3082\u3093}}|Y\u016bhamon|literally \"Ghost (or Spirit) Ripple\", pronounced in the series as the English {{nihongo|\"Stand\"|\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9|Sutando}}}}, so named because they are the manifestation of the user's psychic powers, or what would be their Ripple, in the form of a spiritual familiar that stands with them. A person may obtain a Stand naturally at birth, through rigorous spiritual and/or Ripple training, through exceptionally strong willpower, desire and/or passion, or through inheritance from bloodline. A Stand may never manifest itself until it is amplified by certain conditions or factors and not everyone has the ability to control it. Some Stands appear to have a separate and autonomous personality from their users, able to act on their own to protect them or speak to them. Generally, if the Stand user is incapacitated, the Stand will no longer be a threat (with an exception in Part 5), and any damage to a stand will be reflected on its user, and vice versa.\n* '''Part 4:''' ''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]'' introduces a {{nihongo|Bow and Arrow|\u5f13\u3068\u77e2|Yumi to Ya}}, forged from a mysterious meteorite that made its way to Earth after being drawn in by the spiritual powers of the planet's inhabitants. A Stand can be brought forth after one is pierced by the Arrow; however, the results can be unpredictable, as it could easily kill an unqualified person, and there is no apparent way to know if a person is qualified ahead of time. The Arrows do, however, tend to seek out qualified people on their own if there is someone to guide them.\n* '''Part 5:''' ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'' introduces the ability to create a {{nihongo|\"Requiem\"|{{ruby-ja|\u93ae\u9b42\u6b4c|\u30ec\u30af\u30a4\u30a8\u30e0}}|Rekuiemu}} Stand. If an Arrow hits the Stand instead of the user, the Stand can completely change form and its powers become a Requiem Stand with increased powers that relate to the control over the souls of living beings. Both Giorno's Gold Experience and Polnareff's Silver Chariot are pierced by the Arrow and given Requiem forms. Silver Chariot Requiem's new ability swaps the souls of all living beings, and Gold Experience Requiem's new ability removes the consequences of any action, reverting it to a null state.\n* '''Part 6:''' ''[[Stone Ocean]]'' shows examples of a single person possessing two Stands because of the ability of an extraordinary Stand. Enrico Pucci is able to produce artificial Stand users by stealing others' Stands, transforming them into {{nihongo|Discs|\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af|Disuku}}, and \"inserting\" them into certain individuals. Part 6 also features {{nihongo|DIO's bone|{{ruby-ja|DIO|\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa}}\u306e\u9aa8|DIO no Hone}}, the sole remaining part of DIO which is instrumental in Pucci's {{nihongo|Way to Heaven|\u5929\u56fd\u3078\u884c\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5|Tengoku e Iku H\u014dh\u014d}}. It grants a new and more powerful Stand that ultimately leads to the creation of {{nihongo|Made in Heaven|\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30d8\u30d6\u30f3|Meido In Hebun}}, a powerful Stand that can accelerate the universe to the point of a universal reset in accordance with the [[Big Bounce|Big Bounce cosmological model]].\n* '''Part 7:''' ''[[Steel Ball Run]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Spin|\u56de\u8ee2|Kaiten}}, a technique that incorporates the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]], [[golden spiral]], and {{nihongo|[[golden rectangle]]|\u9ec4\u91d1\u9577\u65b9\u5f62|\u014dgon ch\u014dh\u014dkei}} into a means of manipulating the [[Magnus effect]] to the user's benefit, but its true power lies in its destructive effects. Also introduced in Part 7 is the {{nihongo|Saint's Corpse|\u8056\u4eba\u306e\u907a\u4f53|Seijin no Itai}}, body parts of a deceased holy man (hinted to be [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]) that imbue the user with a Stand if the body part is fused with the user. If the user loses the Corpse part, they lose their Stand.\n* '''Part 8:''' ''[[JoJolion]]'' introduces another method of obtaining a Stand, interaction with the {{nihongo|Wall Eyes|\u58c1\u306e\u76ee|Kabe no Me}}, strange [[fault (geology)|fault]]-like structures that have risen from the ground following the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. They disrupt all forms of transportation, communication, and utilities, but all users of Stands have come in contact with the Wall Eyes at some point. A race of Stand-using {{nihongo|Rock People|\u5ca9\u4eba\u9593|Iwa Ningen}} also appears in ''JoJolion''. These humans seem to innately possess the ability to turn their body into stone and enter a state of suspended animation. Also introduced in Part 8 is the {{nihongo|Rokakaka|\u30ed\u30ab\u30ab\u30ab|Rokakaka}} fruit, which is able to \"fix\" a body part at the expense of taking another away.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Paul Gauguin 106.jpg|thumb|Araki is inspired by western art, such as this piece by [[Paul Gauguin]] which inspired him to use unusual colors in his own art.<ref name=\"comipress\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhk.or.jp/kokokoza/tv/art/archive/chapter015.html |title=NHK\u9ad8\u6821\u8b1b\u5ea7 &#124; \u82b8\u8853\uff08\u7f8e\u8853\u2160\uff0f\u66f8\u9053\u2160\uff09 &#124; \u7b2c15\u56de \u7f8e\u8853(8) \u6f2b\u753b\u306f\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a\u304a\u3082\u3057\u308d\u3044 \u301c\u4eba\u7269\u301c |publisher=Nhk.or.jp |date= |accessdate=August 3, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810200320/http://www.nhk.or.jp/kokokoza/tv/art/archive/chapter015.html |archivedate=August 10, 2014}}</ref>]]\nFor ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'', Araki wanted to use a classical method as a base and then introduce modern elements in the singular.

The most common focus is on \"orientation\" and \"level of operation\". An NGO's orientation refers to the type of activities it takes on.

It includes NGOs with activities directed toward meeting the needs of the disadvantaged people/groups.\n* ''Service orientation'' includes NGOs with activities such as the provision of health, the family planning, or the education services. In these activities, the programme is held by the NGOs, and the people are expected to participate in it and to receive the service.\n* ''Participatory orientation'' is characterized by self-help projects where local people are involved particularly in the implementation of a project by contributing cash, tools, land, materials, labor, etc. In the classical community development project, participation begins with the definition of need and continues to the planning and the implementation stages.\n* ''Empowering orientation'' aims to help poor people develop a clearer understanding of the social, political and economic factors affecting their lives, and to strengthen their awareness of their own potential power to control their lives. There is maximum involvement of the beneficiaries with NGOs acting as facilitators.<ref name=\"Lawry 2009 29-30\">{{cite book |last=Lawry |first=Lynn |title=Guide to Nongovernmental Organizations for the Military |year=2009 |pages=29\u201330 |url=http://www.cdham.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Chapter-4.-NGO-Structure-Authority-and-Standards.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730130926/http://www.cdham.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Chapter-4.-NGO-Structure-Authority-and-Standards.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-30 }}</ref>\n\n=== By level of operation ===\n\n* ''Community-based organizations'' (CBOs) arise out of people's own initiatives.

Some state NGOs also work under the guidance of National and International NGOs.\n* ''National NGOs'' include national organizations such as the [[YMCA]]s/[[YWCA]]s, [[professional association]]s and similar groups. Some have state and city branches and assist local NGOs.\n* ''International NGOs'' range from secular agencies such as [[Save the Children]], to religiously motivated groups. They can be responsible for funding local NGOs, institutions and projects and implementing projects.<ref name=\"Lawry 2009 29-30\" />\n\nApart from \"NGO\", there are alternative or overlapping terms in use, including: [[Voluntary sector|third-sector]] organization (TSO), [[non-profit organization]] (NPO), voluntary organization (VO), [[civil society]] organization (CSO), [[grassroots]] organization (GO), [[social movement organization]] (SMO), private voluntary organization (PVO), [[self-help]] organization (SHO) and [[non-state actors]] (NSAs).\n\nIn Portuguese, Spanish, French, Italian and other [[Romance languages]], the 'mirrored' abbreviation \"ONG\" is in use, which has the same meaning as \"NGO\" (for example ''Organisation non-nongovernmental'' in French, ''Organiza\u00e7\u00e3o N\u00e3o Governmental'' in Portuguese, ''Organizaci\u00f3n no gubernamental'' in Spanish, or ''Organizzazione non governativa'' in Italian).\n\nGovernmental-related organizations / non-governmental organizations are a heterogeneous group.

Examples include improving the state of the [[natural environment]], encouraging the observance of [[human rights]], improving the welfare of the disadvantaged, or representing a corporate agenda.

Track II diplomacy aims to get policymakers and policy analysts to come to a common solution through discussions by unofficial means. Unlike the Track, I diplomacy where government officials, diplomats, and elected leaders gather to talk about certain issues, Track II diplomacy consists of experts, scientists, professors and other figures that are not involved in government affairs. The members of Track II diplomacy can have more freedom to exchange ideas and come up with compromises on their own.\n\n== Activities ==\nThere are numerous classifications of NGOs.

Firstly, NGOs act as implementers, because they mobilize resources in order to provide goods and services to people who are suffering, due to a man-made disaster or a natural disaster. Secondly, NGOs act as catalysts that drive change. They have the ability to \"''inspire, facilitate, or contribute to improved thinking and action to promote change''\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}. Lastly, NGOs often act as partners alongside other organizations in order to tackle problems and address human needs more effectively.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Non-Governmental Organizations and Development|last=Lewis|first=David|last2=Kanji|first2=Nazneen|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=978-0415454308|location=Oxon|pages=12\u201313|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nNGOs vary in their methods. Some act primarily as lobbyists, while others primarily conduct programs and activities. For instance, an NGO such as [[Oxfam]], concerned with poverty alleviation, may provide needy people with the equipment and skills to find food and clean [[drinking water]], whereas an NGO like the [[FFDA]] helps through investigation and documentation of human rights{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} violations and provides legal assistance to victims of human rights abuses. Others, such as the [[Afghanistan Information Management Services]], provide specialized technical products and services to support development activities implemented on the ground by other organizations.\n\n=== Operational ===\nOperational NGOs seek to \"achieve small-scale change directly through projects\".<ref name=\" WillettsCS-NTWKS\" /> They mobilize financial resources, materials, and volunteers to create localized programs. They hold large-scale [[fundraising]] events and may apply to governments and organizations for grants or contracts to raise money for projects. They often operate in a [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] structure; the main headquarters being staffed by professionals who plan projects, create budgets, keep accounts, and report and communicate with operational fieldworkers who work directly on projects.<ref name=\"WillettsCS-NTWKS\" /> Operational NGOs deal with a wide range of issues but are most often associated with the delivery of services or environmental issues, emergency relief, and public welfare. Operational NGOs can be further categorized by the division into relief-oriented versus development-oriented organizations; according to whether they stress service delivery or participation; whether they are religious or secular; and whether they are more public- or private-oriented. Although operational NGOs can be community-based, many are national or international. The defining activity of operational NGOs is the implementation of projects.<ref name=\"WillettsCS-NTWKS\" />\n\n=== Campaigning ===\nCampaigning NGOs seek to \"''achieve large-scale change promoted indirectly through influence of the political system''\".<ref name=\" WillettsCS-NTWKS\" /> Campaigning NGOs need an efficient and effective group of professional members who are able to keep supporters informed, and motivated. They must plan and host demonstrations and events that will keep their cause in the media. They must maintain a large informed network of supporters who can be mobilized for events to garner media attention and influence policy changes. The defining activity of campaigning NGOs is holding demonstrations.<ref name=\" WillettsCS-NTWKS\" /> Campaigning NGOs often deal with issues relating to human rights, women's rights, and children's rights. The primary purpose of an Advocacy NGO is to defend or promote a specific cause. As opposed to operational project management, these organizations typically try to raise awareness, acceptance, and knowledge by lobbying, press work and activist event.<ref name=\" WillettsCS-NTWKS\" />\n\n=== Both operational and campaigning ===\nIt is not uncommon for NGOs to make use of both activities. Many times, operational NGOs will use campaigning techniques if they continually face the same issues in the field that could be remedied through policy changes. At the same time, Campaigning NGOs, like human rights organizations often have programs that assist the individual victims they are trying to help through their advocacy work.<ref name=\"WillettsCS-NTWKS\" />\n\n=== Public relations ===\nNon-governmental organizations need healthy relationships with the public to meet their goals. Foundations and charities use sophisticated public relations campaigns to raise funds and employ standard lobbying techniques with governments. Interest groups may be of political importance because of their ability to influence social and political outcomes. A [[Code of Ethics|code of ethics]] was established in 2002 by The World Association of Non-Governmental Organizations<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wango.org/codeofethics.aspx|title=World Association of Non-Governmental Organizations - Code of Ethics and Conduct for NGOs|website=www.wango.org|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>.\n\n=== Project management ===\nThere is an increasing awareness that management techniques are crucial to project success in non-governmental organizations.<ref>[http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/CCS/pdf/int-work-paper4.pdf 100 <!-- application/pdf, 102909 bytes [[Kibibyte|KiB] --> LSE.ac.uk], Mukasa, Sarah.

Publication of the Centre for Civil Society at the London School of Economics. 2002, p. 11-13.</ref> Generally, private non-governmental organizations have either a community or environmental focus. They address varieties of issues such as religion, emergency aid, or humanitarian affairs. They mobilize public support and voluntary contributions for aid; they often have strong links with community groups in developing countries, and they often work in areas where government-to-government aid is not possible. NGOs are accepted as a part of the international relations landscape, and while they influence national and multilateral policy-making, increasingly they are more directly involved in local action.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Corporate structure ==\n\n=== Staffing ===\nSome NGOs are highly professionalized and rely mainly on paid staff. Others are based around voluntary labor and are less formalized. Not all people working for non-governmental organizations are [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s.\n\nMany NGOs are associated with the use of international staff working in developing countries, but there are many NGOs around the world that rely on local employees or volunteers. There is some dispute as to whether [[expatriate]]s should be sent to developing countries.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Frequently this type of personnel is employed to satisfy a [[Donation|donor]] who wants to see the supported project managed by someone from an [[Developed country|industrialized country]]. However, the expertise of these employees or volunteers may be counterbalanced by a number of factors: the cost of [[Alien (law)|foreigners]] is typically higher, they have no [[grassroots democracy|grass-root connections]] in the country they are sent to, and local expertise is often undervalued.<ref name=\"definition\" />\n\nThe NGO sector is an essential employer in terms of numbers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} For example, by the end of 1995, [[Concern Worldwide|CONCERN worldwide]], an international Northern NGO working against poverty, employed 174 expatriates and just over 5,000 national staff working in ten developing countries in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]], and in [[Haiti]].\n\n=== Funding ===\nMajor sources of NGO funding include membership dues, the sale of [[Product (business)|goods]] and services, grants from international institutions or national governments, and private [[donation]]s. \n\nMany NGOs depend heavily on governments for their funding, even though the term \"non-governmental organization\" implies [[independence]] from governments, <ref name=\"global\" /> A quarter of the US$162 million income in 1998 of the [[Famine relief|famine-relief]] organization [[Oxfam]] was donated by the British government and the EU. The Christian relief and development organization [[World Vision United States]] collected US$55 million worth of goods in 1998 from the American government. Several EU-grants provide funds accessible to NGOs.\n\nGovernment funding of NGOs is controversial since, according to David Rieff, writing in ''[[The New Republic]]'', \"the whole point of humanitarian intervention was precise that NGOs and civil society had both a right and an obligation to respond with acts of aid and solidarity to people in need or being subjected to repression or want by the forces that controlled them, whatever the governments concerned might think about the matter.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.tnr.com/article/world/75421/ng-uh-o?page=0,0 |title=NG-Uh-O \u2013 The trouble with humanitarianism |author=David Rieff |date=June 10, 2010 |newspaper=The New Republic}}</ref> Some NGOs, such as [[Greenpeace]] do not accept funding from governments or intergovernmental organizations.<ref name=\"HBS\">{{cite web |author=Sarah Jane Gilbert |url=http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/5797.html |title=Harvard Business School, HBS Cases: The Value of Environmental Activists |publisher=Hbswk.hbs.edu |date=2008-09-08 |accessdate=2011-12-20}}</ref><ref name=\"GP Annual report 2008\">{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/international-annualreport-2008.pdf |title=Greenpeace Annual Report 2008 |publisher=Greenpeace.org |year=2008 |accessdate=2013-12-24}}</ref>\n\nSome NGOs require sizeable funds to operate.

Funders generally require reporting and assessment, such information is not necessarily publicly available. There may also be associations and watchdog organizations that research and publish details on the actions of NGOs working in particular geographic or program areas.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}\n\nIn recent years, many large corporations have increased their [[corporate social responsibility]] departments in an attempt to preempt NGO campaigns against certain corporate practices. As the logic goes, if corporations work ''with'' NGOs, NGOs will not work ''against'' corporations. Greater collaboration between corporations and NGOs creates inherent risks of [[Co-option|co-optation]] for the weaker partner, typically the non-profit involved.<ref>{{cite journal |year=2012 |title=Corporations and NGOs: When Accountability Leads to Co-optation |journal=Journal of Business Ethics |volume=106 |issue=1 |pages=9\u201321 |doi=10.1007/s10551-011-1057-9|last1=Baur |first1=Dorothea |last2=Schmitz |first2=Hans Peter |url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/312987/files/10551_2011_Article_1057.pdf }}</ref>\n\nIn December 2007, The United States Department of Defense Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) [[S.

Unlike the \"co-option\" strategy described for corporations, the OASD(HA) recognizes the neutrality of health as an essential service. International Health cultivates collaborative relationships with NGOs, albeit at arm's length, recognizing their traditional independence, expertise, and honest broker status. While the goals of DoD and NGOs may seem incongruent, the DoD's emphasis on stability and security to reduce and prevent conflict suggests, on careful analysis, important mutual interests.\n\n== History ==\nInternational non-governmental organizations have a history dating back to at least the late 18th century.<ref>{{cite book |last=Davies |first=Thomas |title=NGOs: A New History of Transnational Civil Society |year=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-938753-3 |page=23 |url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/ngos-9780199387533}}</ref><ref>Steve Charnovitz, \"Two Centuries of Participation: NGOs and International Governance, Michigan Journal of International Law, Winter 1997.</ref> It has been estimated that by 1914, there were 1083 NGOs.<ref>{{cite book |title=Subcontracting Peace \u2013 The Challenges of NGO Peacebuilding |editor1=Oliver P.

Many problems could not be solved within a nation. [[Treaty|International treaties]] and international organizations such as the [[World Trade Organization]] were centred mainly on the interests of capitalist enterprises. In an attempt to counterbalance this trend, NGOs have developed to emphasize [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian issues]], [[developmental aid]], and [[sustainable development]]. A prominent example of this is the [[World Social Forum]], which is a rival convention to the [[World Economic Forum]] held annually in January in [[Davos, Switzerland|Davos]], [[Switzerland]].

Shivji]] is one of Africa's leading experts on law and development issues as an author and academic. His criticism on NGOs is found in two essays: \"Silences in NGO discourse: The role and future of NGOs in Africa\" and \"Reflections on NGOs in Tanzania: What we are, what we are not and what we ought to be\". Shivji argues that despite the good intentions of NGO leaders and activists, he is critical of the \"objective effects of actions, regardless of their intentions\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Shivji |first=Issa G. |title=Silence in NGO discourse: the role and future of NGOs in Africa |year=2007 |publisher=Fahamu |location=Oxford, UK |isbn=978-0-9545637-5-2 |page=84}}</ref> Shivji argues also that the sudden rise of NGOs is part of a [[neoliberal]] paradigm, rather than pure altruistic motivations. He is critical of the current manifestations of NGOs wanting to change the world without understanding it, and that the [[Imperialism|imperial]] relationship continues today with the rise of NGOs.\n\nJames Pfeiffer, in his case study of NGO involvement in Mozambique, speaks to the negative effects that NGOs have had on areas of health within the country. He argues that over the last decade, NGOs in Mozambique have \"fragmented the local health system, undermined local control of health programs, and contributed to growing local social inequality\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nHe notes further that NGOs can be uncoordinated, creating parallel projects among different organizations, that pull health service workers away from their routine duties in order to serve the interests of the NGOs. This ultimately undermines local primary health care efforts and takes away the governments' ability to maintain agency over their own health sector.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal | last1 = Pfeiffer | first1 = J | year = 2003 | title = International NGOs and primary health care in Mozambique: the need for a new model of collaboration | url = | journal = Social Science & Medicine | volume = 56 | issue = 4| pages = 725\u2013738 | doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(02)00068-0| pmid = 12560007 }}</ref> Pfeiffer suggested a new model of collaboration between the NGO and the DPS (the Mozambique Provincial Health Directorate).

Rather than operating through science to be rationally and effectively practical, NGOs have been accused of abusing the utilization of science to gain their own advantages. In the beginning, as Parr indicated, there was \"a tendency among our critics to say that science is the only decision-making tool \u2026 but political and commercial interests are using science as a cover for getting their way.\"<ref name = bond323>{{citation|last = Bond|first = Michael|title = The Backlash against NGOs|work = Prospect|date = April 2000|page =323|url = https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/thebacklashagainstngos}}</ref> At the same time, NGOs can appear to not be cooperative with other groups, according to the previous policy-maker for the German branch of [[Friends of the Earth]], Jens Katjek. \"If NGOs want the best for the environment\", he says, \"they have to learn to compromise.\"<ref name = bond323/>\n\nNGOs have also been questioned as being \"too much of a good thing\".<ref name = Werker>{{cite journal | last1 = Werker | first1 = Eric | last2 = Ahmed | first2 = Faisal Z. | year = 2008 | title = What Do Nongovernmental Organizations Do? | url = | journal = Journal of Economic Perspectives | volume = 22 | issue = 2| pages = 73\u201392 | doi=10.1257/jep.22.2.73}}</ref> Eric Werker and Faisal Ahmed bring up three potential critiques of the role of NGOs in developing nations: too many NGOs in a nation\u2014particularly one ruled by a warlord\u2014reduces the NGO's ability to establish a credible threat of removing humanitarian assistance since they can easily be replaced by another NGO; the frequent process of resource allocation and outsourcing to local organizations in international development projects results in high expenses for NGOs and rings into question how much of the resources and money actually goes to the intended beneficiaries at the end of the allocation process; and finally, NGO missions tend to be too paternalistic and expensive, though Werker and Ahmed propose that vouchers are a good way to overcome this obstacle.<ref name = Werker/>\n\n=== Challenges to legitimacy ===\nThe issue of the legitimacy of NGOs raises a series of important questions. Legitimacy is one of the most important assets possessed by an NGO and is gained due to them being perceived as an \"independent voice\".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Weber | first1 = N. | last2 = Christopherson | first2 = T. | year = 2002 | title = The influence of non-governmental organizations on the creation of Natura 2000 during the European policy process | url = | journal = Forest Policy and Economics | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 1\u201312 | doi=10.1016/s1389-9341(01)00070-3}}</ref><ref name=\"2002aHD\">Edwards, M. and Hulme, D.

Chapter 11.</ref> Their representation also emerges as an important question. Who bestows responsibilities to NGOs or INGOs and how do they gain the representation of citizens and civil society is still not scrutinized thoroughly. For instance, in the article, it is stated, \"To put the point starkly: are the citizens of countries of the South and their needs represented in global civil society, or are citizens as well as their needs constructed by practices of representation? And when we realize that INGOs hardly ever come face to face with the people whose interests and problems they represent, or that they are not accountable to the people they represent, matters become even more troublesome.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chandhoke | first1 = Neera | year = 2005 | title = How Global Is Global Civil Society? | url = | journal = Journal of World-Systems Research | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 326\u2013327 | doi = 10.5195/JWSR.2005.388 }}</ref>\n\nThe origin of funding can have serious implications for the legitimacy of NGOs. NGOs have increased their numbers and range of activities to a level where they have become increasingly dependent on a limited number of donors.<ref name=\"1996HD\">Edwards, M. and Hulme, D. (1996) Too Close for comfort? The impact of official aid on Non-Governmental Organisations. \"World Development.\" 24(6), pp. 961\u2013973.</ref> Consequently, competition has increased for funding, as have the expectations of the donors, who may add conditions that threaten the independence of NGOs.<ref>, Ebrahim, A. (2003) Accountability in practice: Mechanisms for NGOs. \"World Development.\" 31(5), pp.813\u2013829.</ref> An over-dependence on official aid may dilute \"the willingness of NGOs to speak out on issues which are unpopular with governments\".<ref name=2002aHD /> Some commentators have also argued that the changes in NGO funding sources have ultimately altered their functions.<ref name=2002aHD /><ref>[http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/05/17/mckibbens-divestment-tour/ Brought to You by Wall Street], CORY MORNINGSTAR, ''[[CounterPunch]]'', 2013.05.17</ref><ref>[http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/03/14/350-orgs-friends-on-wall-street/ The Climate Wealth Opportunists], CORY MORNINGSTAR, ''[[CounterPunch]]'', 2014.03.14</ref>\n\nNGOs have also been challenged on the grounds that they do not necessarily represent the needs of the developing world, through diminishing the so-called \u201cSouthern Voice\u201d. Some postulate that the [[North\u2013South divide]] exists in the arena of NGOs.<ref name=\"linden\">Lindenberg, M. and Bryant, C. (2001) Going Global: Transforming Relief and Development NGOs. Bloomfield: Kumarian Press.</ref> They question the equality of the relationships between Northern and Southern parts of the same NGOs as well as the relationships between Southern and Northern NGOs working in partnerships. This suggests a division of labor may develop, with the North taking the lead in advocacy and resource mobilization whilst the South engages in service delivery in the developing world.<ref name=linden /> The potential implications of this may mean the needs of the developing world are not addressed appropriately as Northern NGOs do not properly consult or participate in partnerships, such that they assign unrepresentative priorities.<ref>, Jenkins, R. (2001) Corporate Codes of Conduct: Self-Regulation in a Global Economy. \"Technology, Business and Society Programme Paper Number 2.\" United Nations Research Institute for Social Development.</ref>\n\nNGOs are also said to damage the public sector in target countries, e.g. accusations that NGO mismanagement has resulted in the breakdown of public health care systems. Instead of promoting equity and alleviating poverty, NGOs have been under scrutiny for contributing to socioeconomic inequality and dis-empowering services in the public sector of third world countries.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=Patrick-Cockburn>[http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/03/25/how-ngos-failed-afghanistan/ How NGOs Failed Afghanistan], [[Patrick Cockburn]], ''[[CounterPunch]]'', 2014.03.25</ref>\n\nThe scale and variety of activities in which NGOs participate have grown rapidly since 1980, particularly since 1990.<ref>Avina, J. (1993) The Evolutionary Life Cycles if Non-Governmental Development Organisations. \"Public Administration and Development.\" 13(5), pp. 453\u2013474.</ref> This has presented NGOs with a need to balance the pressures of centralization and decentralization. By centralizing NGOs, particularly those that operate at an international level, they can assign a common theme or set of goals. Conversely, it may also be advantageous to decentralize to increase the chances of an NGO responding more flexibly and effectively to localized issues by implementing projects, which are modest in scale, easily monitored, produce immediate benefits, and where all involved know that corruption will be punished.<ref name=Patrick-Cockburn /><ref>Anheier, H. and Themudo, N.

In some countries, the term NGO is applied to an organization that in another country would be called an [[Nonprofit organization|NPO]] (a non-profit organization), and vice versa. [[Political party|Political parties]] and [[Trade union|trade unions]] are considered NGOs only in some countries. There are many different classifications of NGOs in use. The most common focus is on \"orientation\" and \"level of operation\". An NGO's orientation refers to the type of activities it takes on. These activities might include human rights, environmental, improving health, or development work. An NGO's level of operation indicates the scale at which an organization works, such as local, regional, national, or international.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Vakil |first=Anna |title=Confronting the classification problem: Toward a taxonomy of NGOs |journal=World Development |date=December 1997 |volume=25 |issue=12 |pages=2057\u20132070 |doi=10.1016/S0305-750X(97)00098-3}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"''non-governmental organization''\" was first coined in 1945, when the [[United Nations]] (UN) was created.<ref>{{cite book |last=Davies |first=Thomas |title=NGOs: A New History of Transnational Civil Society |year=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-938753-3 |page=3 |url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/ngos-9780199387533}}</ref> The UN, itself an [[intergovernmental organization]], made it possible for certain approved specialized international non-state agencies \u2014 ''i.e.'', non-governmental organizations \u2014 to be awarded observer status at its assemblies and some of its meetings. Later, the term became used more widely. Today, according to the UN, any kind of private organization that is independent of government control can be termed an \"NGO\", provided it is not-for-profit,  but not simply an opposition [[political party]].<ref>[https://www.apa.org/international/united-nations/acronyms.pdf UNITED NATIONS: DEFINITIONS AND TERMS]</ref>\n\nPublic surveys reveal that NGOs often enjoy a high degree of public trust, which can make them a useful \u2013 but not always sufficient \u2013 proxy for the concerns of society and stakeholders.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iisd.org/business/ngo/roles.aspx |title=The rise and role of NGOs in sustainable development |publisher=Iisd.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-24}}</ref>\n\n== Types ==\nNGO/GRO (governmental-related organizations) types can be understood by their orientation and their level of operation.\n\n=== By orientation ===\n\n* ''Charitable orientation'' often involves a top-down effort with little participation or input by beneficiaries. It includes NGOs with activities directed toward meeting the needs of the disadvantaged people/groups.\n* ''Service orientation'' includes NGOs with activities such as the provision of health, the family planning, or the education services. In these activities, the programme is held by the NGOs, and the people are expected to participate in it and to receive the service.\n* ''Participatory orientation'' is characterized by self-help projects where local people are involved particularly in the implementation of a project by contributing cash, tools, land, materials, labor, etc. In the classical community development project, participation begins with the definition of need and continues to the planning and the implementation stages.\n* ''Empowering orientation'' aims to help poor people develop a clearer understanding of the social, political and economic factors affecting their lives, and to strengthen their awareness of their own potential power to control their lives. There is maximum involvement of the beneficiaries with NGOs acting as facilitators.<ref name=\"Lawry 2009 29-30\">{{cite book |last=Lawry |first=Lynn |title=Guide to Nongovernmental Organizations for the Military |year=2009 |pages=29\u201330 |url=http://www.cdham.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Chapter-4.-NGO-Structure-Authority-and-Standards.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730130926/http://www.cdham.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Chapter-4.-NGO-Structure-Authority-and-Standards.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-30 }}</ref>\n\n=== By level of operation ===\n\n* ''Community-based organizations'' (CBOs) arise out of people's own initiatives. They can be responsible for raising the consciousness of the urban poor, helping them  understand their rights in accessing required services and providing such services.\n* ''City-wide organizations'' include organizations such as chambers of commerce and industry, coalitions of business, ethnic or educational groups, and associations of community organizations.\n*''State NGOs'' include state-level organizations, associations and groups. Some state NGOs also work under the guidance of National and International NGOs.\n* ''National NGOs'' include national organizations such as the [[YMCA]]s/[[YWCA]]s, [[professional association]]s and similar groups. Some have state and city branches and assist local NGOs.\n* ''International NGOs'' range from secular agencies such as [[Save the Children]], to religiously motivated groups. They can be responsible for funding local NGOs, institutions and projects and implementing projects.<ref name=\"Lawry 2009 29-30\" />\n\nApart from \"NGO\", there are alternative or overlapping terms in use, including: [[Voluntary sector|third-sector]] organization (TSO), [[non-profit organization]] (NPO), voluntary organization (VO), [[civil society]] organization (CSO), [[grassroots]] organization (GO), [[social movement organization]] (SMO), private voluntary organization (PVO), [[self-help]] organization (SHO) and [[non-state actors]] (NSAs).\n\nIn Portuguese, Spanish, French, Italian and other [[Romance languages]], the 'mirrored' abbreviation \"ONG\" is in use, which has the same meaning as \"NGO\" (for example ''Organisation non-nongovernmental'' in French, ''Organiza\u00e7\u00e3o N\u00e3o Governmental'' in Portuguese, ''Organizaci\u00f3n no gubernamental'' in Spanish, or ''Organizzazione non governativa'' in Italian).\n\nGovernmental-related organizations / non-governmental organizations are a heterogeneous group. As a result, a long list of additional acronyms has developed, including:\n* BINGO: 'Business-friendly international NGO' or 'Big international NGO'\n* SBO: 'Social Benefit Organization,' a positive, goal-oriented designation as a substitute for the negative, \"Non-\" designations\n* TANGO: 'Technical assistance NGO'\n* TSO: 'third-sector organization'\n* [[GONGO]]: 'government-organized non-governmental organization' or 'government-operated NGOs' (set up by governments to look like NGOs in order to qualify for outside aid or promote the interests of government)\n* DONGO: 'Donor-organized NGO'\n* [[International non-governmental organization|INGO]]: 'International NGO'\n* [[QUANGO]]: 'quasi-autonomous NGO,' or [[QUANGO]] refers to NGOs set up and funded by the government. The term is particularly prevalent within the UK (where there are more than 1,200 of them), the Republic of Ireland, and the Commonwealth. \n* National NGO: A non-governmental organization that exists only in one country.

Examples include improving the state of the [[natural environment]], encouraging the observance of [[human rights]], improving the welfare of the disadvantaged, or representing a corporate agenda. However, there are a huge number of such organizations and their goals cover a broad range of political and philosophical positions. This can also easily be applied to private schools and athletic organizations.\n\n=== Track II diplomacy ===\n{{Main article|Track II diplomacy}}\nTrack II dialogue, or Track II diplomacy, is transnational coordination that involves non-official members of the government including [[epistemic community|epistemic communities]] as well as former policy-makers or analysts. Track II diplomacy aims to get policymakers and policy analysts to come to a common solution through discussions by unofficial means. Unlike the Track, I diplomacy where government officials, diplomats, and elected leaders gather to talk about certain issues, Track II diplomacy consists of experts, scientists, professors and other figures that are not involved in government affairs. The members of Track II diplomacy can have more freedom to exchange ideas and come up with compromises on their own.\n\n== Activities ==\nThere are numerous classifications of NGOs. The typology the [[World Bank]] uses divides them into Operational and Advocacy.<ref name=\"definition\">[http://docs.lib.duke.edu/igo/guides/ngo/define.htm World Bank Criteria defining NGO] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621135344/http://docs.lib.duke.edu/igo/guides/ngo/define.htm |date=June 21, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nGenerally, NGOs act as implementers, catalysts, and partners. Firstly, NGOs act as implementers, because they mobilize resources in order to provide goods and services to people who are suffering, due to a man-made disaster or a natural disaster. Secondly, NGOs act as catalysts that drive change. They have the ability to \"''inspire, facilitate, or contribute to improved thinking and action to promote change''\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}. Lastly, NGOs often act as partners alongside other organizations in order to tackle problems and address human needs more effectively.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Non-Governmental Organizations and Development|last=Lewis|first=David|last2=Kanji|first2=Nazneen|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=978-0415454308|location=Oxon|pages=12\u201313|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nNGOs vary in their methods. Some act primarily as lobbyists, while others primarily conduct programs and activities. For instance, an NGO such as [[Oxfam]], concerned with poverty alleviation, may provide needy people with the equipment and skills to find food and clean [[drinking water]], whereas an NGO like the [[FFDA]] helps through investigation and documentation of human rights{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} violations and provides legal assistance to victims of human rights abuses. Others, such as the [[Afghanistan Information Management Services]], provide specialized technical products and services to support development activities implemented on the ground by other organizations.\n\n=== Operational ===\nOperational NGOs seek to \"achieve small-scale change directly through projects\".<ref name=\" WillettsCS-NTWKS\" /> They mobilize financial resources, materials, and volunteers to create localized programs. They hold large-scale [[fundraising]] events and may apply to governments and organizations for grants or contracts to raise money for projects. They often operate in a [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] structure; the main headquarters being staffed by professionals who plan projects, create budgets, keep accounts, and report and communicate with operational fieldworkers who work directly on projects.<ref name=\"WillettsCS-NTWKS\" /> Operational NGOs deal with a wide range of issues but are most often associated with the delivery of services or environmental issues, emergency relief, and public welfare. Operational NGOs can be further categorized by the division into relief-oriented versus development-oriented organizations; according to whether they stress service delivery or participation; whether they are religious or secular; and whether they are more public- or private-oriented. Although operational NGOs can be community-based, many are national or international. The defining activity of operational NGOs is the implementation of projects.<ref name=\"WillettsCS-NTWKS\" />\n\n=== Campaigning ===\nCampaigning NGOs seek to \"''achieve large-scale change promoted indirectly through influence of the political system''\".<ref name=\" WillettsCS-NTWKS\" /> Campaigning NGOs need an efficient and effective group of professional members who are able to keep supporters informed, and motivated. They must plan and host demonstrations and events that will keep their cause in the media. They must maintain a large informed network of supporters who can be mobilized for events to garner media attention and influence policy changes. The defining activity of campaigning NGOs is holding demonstrations.<ref name=\" WillettsCS-NTWKS\" /> Campaigning NGOs often deal with issues relating to human rights, women's rights, and children's rights. The primary purpose of an Advocacy NGO is to defend or promote a specific cause. As opposed to operational project management, these organizations typically try to raise awareness, acceptance, and knowledge by lobbying, press work and activist event.<ref name=\" WillettsCS-NTWKS\" />\n\n=== Both operational and campaigning ===\nIt is not uncommon for NGOs to make use of both activities. Many times, operational NGOs will use campaigning techniques if they continually face the same issues in the field that could be remedied through policy changes. At the same time, Campaigning NGOs, like human rights organizations often have programs that assist the individual victims they are trying to help through their advocacy work.<ref name=\"WillettsCS-NTWKS\" />\n\n=== Public relations ===\nNon-governmental organizations need healthy relationships with the public to meet their goals. Foundations and charities use sophisticated public relations campaigns to raise funds and employ standard lobbying techniques with governments. Interest groups may be of political importance because of their ability to influence social and political outcomes. A [[Code of Ethics|code of ethics]] was established in 2002 by The World Association of Non-Governmental Organizations<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wango.org/codeofethics.aspx|title=World Association of Non-Governmental Organizations - Code of Ethics and Conduct for NGOs|website=www.wango.org|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>.\n\n=== Project management ===\nThere is an increasing awareness that management techniques are crucial to project success in non-governmental organizations.<ref>[http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/CCS/pdf/int-work-paper4.pdf 100 <!-- application/pdf, 102909 bytes [[Kibibyte|KiB] --> LSE.ac.uk], Mukasa, Sarah. ''Are expatriate staff necessary in international development NGOs? A case study of an international NGO in Uganda.'' Publication of the Centre for Civil Society at the London School of Economics. 2002, p. 11-13.</ref> Generally, private non-governmental organizations have either a community or environmental focus. They address varieties of issues such as religion, emergency aid, or humanitarian affairs. They mobilize public support and voluntary contributions for aid; they often have strong links with community groups in developing countries, and they often work in areas where government-to-government aid is not possible. NGOs are accepted as a part of the international relations landscape, and while they influence national and multilateral policy-making, increasingly they are more directly involved in local action.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Corporate structure ==\n\n=== Staffing ===\nSome NGOs are highly professionalized and rely mainly on paid staff. Others are based around voluntary labor and are less formalized. Not all people working for non-governmental organizations are [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s.\n\nMany NGOs are associated with the use of international staff working in developing countries, but there are many NGOs around the world that rely on local employees or volunteers. There is some dispute as to whether [[expatriate]]s should be sent to developing countries.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Frequently this type of personnel is employed to satisfy a [[Donation|donor]] who wants to see the supported project managed by someone from an [[Developed country|industrialized country]]. However, the expertise of these employees or volunteers may be counterbalanced by a number of factors: the cost of [[Alien (law)|foreigners]] is typically higher, they have no [[grassroots democracy|grass-root connections]] in the country they are sent to, and local expertise is often undervalued.<ref name=\"definition\" />\n\nThe NGO sector is an essential employer in terms of numbers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} For example, by the end of 1995, [[Concern Worldwide|CONCERN worldwide]], an international Northern NGO working against poverty, employed 174 expatriates and just over 5,000 national staff working in ten developing countries in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]], and in [[Haiti]].\n\n=== Funding ===\nMajor sources of NGO funding include membership dues, the sale of [[Product (business)|goods]] and services, grants from international institutions or national governments, and private [[donation]]s. \n\nMany NGOs depend heavily on governments for their funding, even though the term \"non-governmental organization\" implies [[independence]] from governments, <ref name=\"global\" /> A quarter of the US$162 million income in 1998 of the [[Famine relief|famine-relief]] organization [[Oxfam]] was donated by the British government and the EU. The Christian relief and development organization [[World Vision United States]] collected US$55 million worth of goods in 1998 from the American government. Several EU-grants provide funds accessible to NGOs.\n\nGovernment funding of NGOs is controversial since, according to David Rieff, writing in ''[[The New Republic]]'', \"the whole point of humanitarian intervention was precise that NGOs and civil society had both a right and an obligation to respond with acts of aid and solidarity to people in need or being subjected to repression or want by the forces that controlled them, whatever the governments concerned might think about the matter.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.tnr.com/article/world/75421/ng-uh-o?page=0,0 |title=NG-Uh-O \u2013 The trouble with humanitarianism |author=David Rieff |date=June 10, 2010 |newspaper=The New Republic}}</ref> Some NGOs, such as [[Greenpeace]] do not accept funding from governments or intergovernmental organizations.<ref name=\"HBS\">{{cite web |author=Sarah Jane Gilbert |url=http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/5797.html |title=Harvard Business School, HBS Cases: The Value of Environmental Activists |publisher=Hbswk.hbs.edu |date=2008-09-08 |accessdate=2011-12-20}}</ref><ref name=\"GP Annual report 2008\">{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/international-annualreport-2008.pdf |title=Greenpeace Annual Report 2008 |publisher=Greenpeace.org |year=2008 |accessdate=2013-12-24}}</ref>\n\nSome NGOs require sizeable funds to operate.

Many problems could not be solved within a nation. [[Treaty|International treaties]] and international organizations such as the [[World Trade Organization]] were centred mainly on the interests of capitalist enterprises. In an attempt to counterbalance this trend, NGOs have developed to emphasize [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian issues]], [[developmental aid]], and [[sustainable development]].

His criticism on NGOs is found in two essays: \"Silences in NGO discourse: The role and future of NGOs in Africa\" and \"Reflections on NGOs in Tanzania: What we are, what we are not and what we ought to be\".

He is critical of the current manifestations of NGOs wanting to change the world without understanding it, and that the [[Imperialism|imperial]] relationship continues today with the rise of NGOs.\n\nJames Pfeiffer, in his case study of NGO involvement in Mozambique, speaks to the negative effects that NGOs have had on areas of health within the country. He argues that over the last decade, NGOs in Mozambique have \"fragmented the local health system, undermined local control of health programs, and contributed to growing local social inequality\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nHe notes further that NGOs can be uncoordinated, creating parallel projects among different organizations, that pull health service workers away from their routine duties in order to serve the interests of the NGOs. This ultimately undermines local primary health care efforts and takes away the governments' ability to maintain agency over their own health sector.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal | last1 = Pfeiffer | first1 = J | year = 2003 | title = International NGOs and primary health care in Mozambique: the need for a new model of collaboration | url = | journal = Social Science & Medicine | volume = 56 | issue = 4| pages = 725\u2013738 | doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(02)00068-0| pmid = 12560007 }}</ref> Pfeiffer suggested a new model of collaboration between the NGO and the DPS (the Mozambique Provincial Health Directorate).

Print.</ref>\n\nNGOs have also been accused of using white lies or misinformed advice to enact their campaigns, i.e., accusations that NGOs have been ignorant about critical issues because, as chief scientist at [[Greenpeace]] Doug Parr said, these organizations appear to have lost their efforts in being truly scientific and now seem to be more self-interested. Rather than operating through science to be rationally and effectively practical, NGOs have been accused of abusing the utilization of science to gain their own advantages. In the beginning, as Parr indicated, there was \"a tendency among our critics to say that science is the only decision-making tool \u2026 but political and commercial interests are using science as a cover for getting their way.\"<ref name = bond323>{{citation|last = Bond|first = Michael|title = The Backlash against NGOs|work = Prospect|date = April 2000|page =323|url = https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/thebacklashagainstngos}}</ref> At the same time, NGOs can appear to not be cooperative with other groups, according to the previous policy-maker for the German branch of [[Friends of the Earth]], Jens Katjek. \"If NGOs want the best for the environment\", he says, \"they have to learn to compromise.\"<ref name = bond323/>\n\nNGOs have also been questioned as being \"too much of a good thing\".<ref name = Werker>{{cite journal | last1 = Werker | first1 = Eric | last2 = Ahmed | first2 = Faisal Z. | year = 2008 | title = What Do Nongovernmental Organizations Do? | url = | journal = Journal of Economic Perspectives | volume = 22 | issue = 2| pages = 73\u201392 | doi=10.1257/jep.22.2.73}}</ref> Eric Werker and Faisal Ahmed bring up three potential critiques of the role of NGOs in developing nations: too many NGOs in a nation\u2014particularly one ruled by a warlord\u2014reduces the NGO's ability to establish a credible threat of removing humanitarian assistance since they can easily be replaced by another NGO; the frequent process of resource allocation and outsourcing to local organizations in international development projects results in high expenses for NGOs and rings into question how much of the resources and money actually goes to the intended beneficiaries at the end of the allocation process; and finally, NGO missions tend to be too paternalistic and expensive, though Werker and Ahmed propose that vouchers are a good way to overcome this obstacle.<ref name = Werker/>\n\n=== Challenges to legitimacy ===\nThe issue of the legitimacy of NGOs raises a series of important questions. Legitimacy is one of the most important assets possessed by an NGO and is gained due to them being perceived as an \"independent voice\".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Weber | first1 = N. | last2 = Christopherson | first2 = T. | year = 2002 | title = The influence of non-governmental organizations on the creation of Natura 2000 during the European policy process | url = | journal = Forest Policy and Economics | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 1\u201312 | doi=10.1016/s1389-9341(01)00070-3}}</ref><ref name=\"2002aHD\">Edwards, M. and Hulme, D.

Chapter 11.</ref> Their representation also emerges as an important question. Who bestows responsibilities to NGOs or INGOs and how do they gain the representation of citizens and civil society is still not scrutinized thoroughly. For instance, in the article, it is stated, \"To put the point starkly: are the citizens of countries of the South and their needs represented in global civil society, or are citizens as well as their needs constructed by practices of representation? And when we realize that INGOs hardly ever come face to face with the people whose interests and problems they represent, or that they are not accountable to the people they represent, matters become even more troublesome.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chandhoke | first1 = Neera | year = 2005 | title = How Global Is Global Civil Society? | url = | journal = Journal of World-Systems Research | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 326\u2013327 | doi = 10.5195/JWSR.2005.388 }}</ref>\n\nThe origin of funding can have serious implications for the legitimacy of NGOs. NGOs have increased their numbers and range of activities to a level where they have become increasingly dependent on a limited number of donors.<ref name=\"1996HD\">Edwards, M. and Hulme, D. (1996) Too Close for comfort? The impact of official aid on Non-Governmental Organisations. \"World Development.\" 24(6), pp. 961\u2013973.</ref> Consequently, competition has increased for funding, as have the expectations of the donors, who may add conditions that threaten the independence of NGOs.<ref>, Ebrahim, A. (2003) Accountability in practice: Mechanisms for NGOs. \"World Development.\" 31(5), pp.813\u2013829.</ref> An over-dependence on official aid may dilute \"the willingness of NGOs to speak out on issues which are unpopular with governments\".<ref name=2002aHD /> Some commentators have also argued that the changes in NGO funding sources have ultimately altered their functions.<ref name=2002aHD /><ref>[http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/05/17/mckibbens-divestment-tour/ Brought to You by Wall Street], CORY MORNINGSTAR, ''[[CounterPunch]]'', 2013.05.17</ref><ref>[http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/03/14/350-orgs-friends-on-wall-street/ The Climate Wealth Opportunists], CORY MORNINGSTAR, ''[[CounterPunch]]'', 2014.03.14</ref>\n\nNGOs have also been challenged on the grounds that they do not necessarily represent the needs of the developing world, through diminishing the so-called \u201cSouthern Voice\u201d. Some postulate that the [[North\u2013South divide]] exists in the arena of NGOs.<ref name=\"linden\">Lindenberg, M. and Bryant, C. (2001) Going Global: Transforming Relief and Development NGOs. Bloomfield: Kumarian Press.</ref> They question the equality of the relationships between Northern and Southern parts of the same NGOs as well as the relationships between Southern and Northern NGOs working in partnerships. This suggests a division of labor may develop, with the North taking the lead in advocacy and resource mobilization whilst the South engages in service delivery in the developing world.<ref name=linden /> The potential implications of this may mean the needs of the developing world are not addressed appropriately as Northern NGOs do not properly consult or participate in partnerships, such that they assign unrepresentative priorities.<ref>, Jenkins, R. (2001) Corporate Codes of Conduct: Self-Regulation in a Global Economy. \"Technology, Business and Society Programme Paper Number 2.\" United Nations Research Institute for Social Development.</ref>\n\nNGOs are also said to damage the public sector in target countries, e.g. accusations that NGO mismanagement has resulted in the breakdown of public health care systems. Instead of promoting equity and alleviating poverty, NGOs have been under scrutiny for contributing to socioeconomic inequality and dis-empowering services in the public sector of third world countries.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=Patrick-Cockburn>[http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/03/25/how-ngos-failed-afghanistan/ How NGOs Failed Afghanistan], [[Patrick Cockburn]], ''[[CounterPunch]]'', 2014.03.25</ref>\n\nThe scale and variety of activities in which NGOs participate have grown rapidly since 1980, particularly since 1990.<ref>Avina, J. (1993) The Evolutionary Life Cycles if Non-Governmental Development Organisations. \"Public Administration and Development.\" 13(5), pp. 453\u2013474.</ref> This has presented NGOs with a need to balance the pressures of centralization and decentralization. By centralizing NGOs, particularly those that operate at an international level, they can assign a common theme or set of goals. Conversely, it may also be advantageous to decentralize to increase the chances of an NGO responding more flexibly and effectively to localized issues by implementing projects, which are modest in scale, easily monitored, produce immediate benefits, and where all involved know that corruption will be punished.<ref name=Patrick-Cockburn /><ref>Anheier, H. and Themudo, N.
