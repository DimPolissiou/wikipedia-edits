The building is at least the fourth on approximately the same site and mainly dates to the 1890s. It incorporates traces and small parts of some its earlier forebears.\n[[File:Rear of Esher Place - geograph.org.uk - 718490.jpg|thumb|200px|right|View of Esher Place today, seen from the west and showing the rear of the house.]]\n\n==History==\nThe first recorded predecessor was acquired by or for [[Peter des Roches]], [[Bishop of Winchester]], for his bishopric, early in the 13th century.  The house was torn down in the latter half of the 15th century by [[William Waynflete]], Bishop of Winchester and [[Lord Chancellor]], to make way for a large brick residence (with a tall slender tower [[gatehouse]] (''Waynflete's Tower'', see below) that stands today).   [[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Wolsey]], who possessed Esher Place as Bishop of Winchester, was kept under [[house arrest]] here after his fall from power.  The estate was then seized by [[Henry VIII]], restored to the Bishop of Winchester by [[Mary I of England|Mary I]], and the lease was then re-purchased by the Crown under [[Elizabeth I]], who granted it to her [[List of Lords High Admiral|Lord High Admiral]], [[William Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Effingham|Lord Howard of Effingham]], who granted it to [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]]'s cousin [[Richard Drake]].  After the defeat of the Spanish Armada, three captured Spanish admirals and their retinue were held at Esher for over five years. It remained in the Drake family until 1634. Over the next 75 years, the house which had more land than today was held by at least seven individuals, the last two being Sir Thomas Lynch, an early [[List of Governors of Jamaica|English governor]] of [[History of Jamaica|Jamaica]], and John Latton, a pluralistic office-holder under [[William III of England|William III]] (William of Orange).\n\n[[File:Esher Place 1737.jpg|thumb|East View of Esher Place, Surrey, England in 1737. A line engraving drawn and engraved by the brothers Samuel and Nathaniel Buck. The print is dated to 1737.]]\n\nIn 1716 its wider agricultural [[estate (land)|estate]] was separated from what was its [[manor]] house, that is, sold to the first [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Duke of Newcastle]], who owned [[Claremont (country house)|Claremont]] in the same [[ecclesiastical parish|parish]].  The house (and immediate grounds), passed through two owners, including Peter Delaperte, one of the directors of the [[South Sea Company]], and came into the ownership of the Duke's younger brother, [[Henry Pelham]], in 1729.  Pelham hired [[William Kent]] to renovate the property who did so by having demolished much of the medieval and Tudor portions &mdash; except for the [[Esher Place#Waynflete's Tower|gatehouse]] &mdash; and adding wings and some of the earliest [[Gothic revival]] ornamentation in England.\n\nIn ''[[The Seasons (Thomson poem)|The Seasons]]'', the Scottish poet [[James Thomson (poet)|James Thomson]] (author of the lyrics to ''[[Rule, Britannia!]]'') praises\n\n{{cquote|Esher's peaceful grove/Where Kent and Nature vie for Pelham's love...Where, in the sweetest solitude embraced, by the soft windings of the gentle Mole, from courts and senates Pelham finds repose.\".<ref name=\"Nairn\">Nairn (2002), p. 222-23.</ref>}}  Esher Place's owner's family by owning the house had the privilege of using one half of the [[St. George's Church, Esher#Newcastle Pew|Newcastle Pew]] at [[St. George's Church, Esher]].  After Pelham's death, the property passed to his daughter, and was then purchased in 1805 by London merchant John Spicer.\n\n[[File:West View of Esher Place engraved 1759..jpg|thumb|West View of Esher Place, Surrey 1759, as earlier remodelled by William Kent.]]\n\nSpicer pulled down the house and used the material to build another, designed by [[Edward Lapidge]],<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Lapidge, Edward|last=Cust|first=Lionel Henry|authorlink=|volume=32}}</ref> on a more elevated site.

Vincent had purchased the much-reduced estate in 1895 from [[Money Wigram]], who had bought it from the Spicer heirs.  Vincent &mdash; Lord D'Abernon after 1914 &mdash; had guests including [[Edward VIII]] (the British King in much of the year 1936) when [[Prince of Wales]], [[Cecil Rhodes]], and [[Anna Pavlova]]. However, in 1930 Lord D'Abernon gave the house to the [[Ragged school|Ragged School Union later the Shaftesbury Society]], while most of the grounds were sold to developers who built a housing estate around the mansion.<ref>[http://www.esherplace.com Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202153515/http://www.esherplace.com/ |date=2011-02-02 }} with historical information</ref>  The house became the Shaftesbury Home for young children from 1930 until 1952, when it was sold to the [[Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union|Electrical Trades Union]] (now merged into Unite the Union), which opened it in 1953 as the college it remains today.

The house was torn down in the latter half of the 15th century by [[William Waynflete]], Bishop of Winchester and [[Lord Chancellor]], to make way for a large brick residence (with a tall slender tower [[gatehouse]] (''Waynflete's Tower'', see below) that stands today).   [[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Wolsey]], who possessed Esher Place as Bishop of Winchester, was kept under [[house arrest]] here after his fall from power.  The estate was then seized by [[Henry VIII]], restored to the Bishop of Winchester by [[Mary I of England|Mary I]], and the lease was then re-purchased by the Crown under [[Elizabeth I]], who granted it to her [[List of Lords High Admiral|Lord High Admiral]], [[William Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Effingham|Lord Howard of Effingham]], who granted it to [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]]'s cousin [[Richard Drake]].  After the defeat of the Spanish Armada, three captured Spanish admirals and their retinue were held at Esher for over five years. It remained in the Drake family until 1634. Over the next 75 years, the house which had more land than today was held by at least seven individuals, the last two being Sir Thomas Lynch, an early [[List of Governors of Jamaica|English governor]] of [[History of Jamaica|Jamaica]], and John Latton, a pluralistic office-holder under [[William III of England|William III]] (William of Orange).\n\n[[File:Esher Place 1737.jpg|thumb|East View of Esher Place, Surrey, England in 1737. A line engraving drawn and engraved by the brothers Samuel and Nathaniel Buck. The print is dated to 1737.]]\n\nIn 1716 its wider agricultural [[estate (land)|estate]] was separated from what was its [[manor]] house, that is, sold to the first [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Duke of Newcastle]], who owned [[Claremont (country house)|Claremont]] in the same [[ecclesiastical parish|parish]].  The house (and immediate grounds), passed through two owners, including Peter Delaperte, one of the directors of the [[South Sea Company]], and came into the ownership of the Duke's younger brother, [[Henry Pelham]], in 1729.  Pelham hired [[William Kent]] to renovate the property who did so by having demolished much of the medieval and Tudor portions &mdash; except for the [[Esher Place#Waynflete's Tower|gatehouse]] &mdash; and adding wings and some of the earliest [[Gothic revival]] ornamentation in England.\n\nIn ''[[The Seasons (Thomson poem)|The Seasons]]'', the Scottish poet [[James Thomson (poet)|James Thomson]] (author of the lyrics to ''[[Rule, Britannia!]]'') praises\n\n{{cquote|Esher's peaceful grove/Where Kent and Nature vie for Pelham's love...Where, in the sweetest solitude embraced, by the soft windings of the gentle Mole, from courts and senates Pelham finds repose.\".<ref name=\"Nairn\">Nairn (2002), p. 222-23.</ref>}}  Esher Place's owner's family by owning the house had the privilege of using one half of the [[St. George's Church, Esher#Newcastle Pew|Newcastle Pew]] at [[St. George's Church, Esher]].  After Pelham's death, the property passed to his daughter, and was then purchased in 1805 by London merchant John Spicer.\n\n[[File:West View of Esher Place engraved 1759..jpg|thumb|West View of Esher Place, Surrey 1759, as earlier remodelled by William Kent.]]\n\nSpicer pulled down the house and used the material to build another, designed by [[Edward Lapidge]],<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Lapidge, Edward|last=Cust|first=Lionel Henry|authorlink=|volume=32}}</ref> on a more elevated site.

Traditional uses of trip hammers include pounding, [[wikt:decorticate|decorticating]] and polishing of grain in [[agriculture]]. In [[mining]], trip hammers were used for crushing metal [[ore]]s into small pieces, although a [[stamp mill]] was more usual for this. In [[finery forge]]s they were used for drawing out [[bloomery|blooms]] made from [[wrought iron]] into more workable [[Wrought iron|bar iron]]. They were also used for fabricating various articles of [[wrought iron]], [[latten]] (an early form of [[brass]]), [[steel]] and other metals.\n\nOne or more trip hammers were set up in a [[forge]], also known variously as a [[hammer mill]], hammer forge or hammer works. The hammers were usually raised by a [[cam]] and then released to fall under the force of [[Gravitation|gravity]]. Historically, trip hammers were often powered [[Hydropower|hydraulically]] by a [[water wheel]]. \n\nTrip hammers are known to have been used in [[Imperial China]] since the [[Western Han dynasty]]. They also existed in the contemporary [[Greco-Roman world]], with more evidence of their use in [[medieval Europe]] during the 12th century. During the [[Industrial Revolution]] the trip hammer fell out of favor and was replaced with the [[power hammer]]. Often multiple hammers were powered via a set of [[line shaft]]s, pulleys and belts from a centrally located power supply.\n\n==Early history==\n\n===China===\n[[File:Hydraulic-Powdered Trip Hammers.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Hydrodynamic powered trip hammer set, illustration from the ''Tiangong Kaiwu'' encyclopedia of 1637, written by [[Song Yingxing]] (1587\u20131666)]]\nIn ancient China, the trip hammer evolved out of the use of the [[mortar and pestle]], which in turn gave rise to the treadle-operated tilt-hammer ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: \u7893 [[Pinyin]]: ''dui''; [[Wade-Giles]]: ''tui'').<ref name=\"neehdam volume 4 part 2 183\" >Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 183.</ref> The latter was a simple device employing a lever and fulcrum (operated by pressure applied by the weight of one's foot to one end), which featured a series of catches or lugs on the main revolving shaft as well.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 390\">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 390.</ref> This device enabled the labor of pounding, often in the decorticating and polishing of grain, and avoided manual use of pounding with hand and arm. Although historians assert that its origins may span as far back as the [[Zhou Dynasty]] (1050 BC\u2013221 BC), the earliest texts to describe the device are the ''[[Jijiupian]]'' dictionary of 40 BC, [[Yang Xiong (author)|Yang Xiong]]'s text known as the ''[[Fangyan]]'' of 15 BC, as well as the ''Xin Lun'' written by [[Huan Tan]] about 20 AD (during the usurpation of [[Wang Mang]]).<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 184\" >Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 184.</ref> The latter book states that the legendary mythological king known as [[Fu Xi]] was the one responsible for the pestle and mortar (which evolved into the tilt-hammer and then trip hammer device). Although the author speaks of the mythological Fu Xi, a passage of his writing gives hint that the waterwheel and trip-hammer were in widespread use by the 1st century AD in China (for water-powered Chinese [[metallurgy]], see [[Du Shi]]):\n\n<blockquote>Fu Hsi invented the pestle and mortar, which is so useful, and later on it was cleverly improved in such a way that the whole weight of the body could be used for treading on the tilt-hammer (tui), thus increasing the efficiency ten times. Afterwards the power of animals\u2014donkeys, mules, oxen, and horses\u2014was applied by means of machinery, and water-power too used for pounding, so that the benefit was increased a hundredfold.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 392\">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 392.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nWith his description, it is seen that the out-of-date Chinese term for pestle and mortar (dui, tui) would soon be replaced with the Chinese term for the water-powered trip-hammer ({{zh|links=no|c=\u6c34\u7893|p=shu\u01d0 du\u00ec|w=shui tui}}.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 390\"/> The [[Han Dynasty]] scholar and poet [[Ma Rong]] (79\u2013166 AD) mentioned in one of his poems of hammers 'pounding in the water-echoing caves'.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 392\"/> As described in the ''[[Hou Han Shu]]'', in 129 AD the official [[Yu Xu (official)|Yu Xu]] gave a report to [[Emperor Shun of Han]] that trip hammers were being exported from Han China to the Western [[Qiang people]] by way of canals through the [[Qilian Mountains]].<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 392\"/> In his ''Rou Xing Lun'', the government official [[Kong Rong]] (153\u2013208 AD) remarked that the invention of the trip hammer was an excellent example of a product created by intelligent men during his own age (comparing the relative achievements of the sages of old).<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 392\"/> During the 3rd century AD, the high government official and engineer [[Du Yu]] established the use of combined trip hammer batteries (lian zhi dui), which employed several shafts that were arranged to work off one large waterwheel.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 393\">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 393.</ref> In Chinese texts of the 4th century, there are written accounts of men possessing and operating hundreds of trip hammer machines, such as the venerable mathematician Wang Rong (died 306 AD), Deng Yu (died 326 AD), and Shi Chong (died 300 AD), responsible for the operation of hundreds of trip hammers in over thirty governmental districts throughout China.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 392-393\">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 392-393.</ref> There are numerous references to trip hammers during the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618\u2013907 AD) and [[Song Dynasty]] (960\u20131279), and there are [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368\u20131644) references that report the use of trip hammers in [[papermill]]s of [[Fujian]] Province.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 394\">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 394.</ref>\n\nAlthough Chinese trip hammers in China were sometimes powered by the more efficient vertical-set waterwheel, the Chinese often employed the horizontal-set waterwheel in operating trip hammers, along with recumbent hammers.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 391 392\">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 391\u2013392.</ref> The recumbent hammer was found in Chinese illustrations by 1313 AD, with the publishing of [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]]'s ''Nong Shu'' book on ancient and contemporary (medieval) metallurgy in China.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 395\">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 395.</ref> There were also illustrations of trip hammers in an encyclopedia of 1637, written by [[Song Yingxing]] (1587\u20131666).<ref name=\"Song 91 93\">Song, 91\u201393.</ref>\n\n=== Greco-Roman world ===\n[[File:Carreg Pumsaint - geograph.org.uk - 396874.jpg|thumb|The regular indentations on the [[Dolaucothi Gold Mines#Carreg Pumsaint|Carreg Pumsaint]] and similar mortar blocks are believed to stem from mechanically-operated trip hammers.<ref name=\"Barry C.

Their use was described in medieval written sources of [[Styria]] (in modern-day Austria), written in 1135 and another in 1175 AD.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 379\" >Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 379.</ref> Medieval French sources of the years 1116 and 1249 both record the use of mechanised trip hammers used in the forging of [[wrought iron]].<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 379\"/> Medieval European trip hammers by the 15th century were most often in the shape of the vertical pestle stamp-mill, although they employed more frequent use of the vertical waterwheel than earlier Chinese versions (which often used the horizontal waterwheel).<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 394\" /> The well-known [[Renaissance]] artist and inventor [[Leonardo da Vinci]] often sketched trip hammers for use in forges and even file-cutting machinery, those of the vertical pestle stamp-mill type.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 395\"/> The oldest depicted European illustration of a [[martinet]] forge-hammer is perhaps the [[Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus]] of [[Olaus Magnus]], dated to 1565 AD.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 395\"/> In this woodcut image, there is the scene of three martinets and a waterwheel working wood and leather bellows of the [[Osmund Bloomery]] furnace.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 395\"/> The recumbent hammer was first depicted in European artwork in an illustration by [[Joachim von Sandrart|Sandrart]] and [[Zonca]] (dated 1621 AD).<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 395\"/>\n\n==Types==\nA trip hammer has the head mounted at the end of a recumbent [[wikt:helve#Noun|helve]], hence the alternative name of helve hammer.  The choice of which type was used in a particular context may have depended on the strain that its operation imposed on the helve.  This was normally of wood, mounted in a cast iron ring (called the hurst) where it pivoted.  However, in the 19th century the heaviest helves were sometimes a single casting, incorporating the hurst.\n\n[[File:Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet - Tilt Hammers - geograph.org.uk - 2425530.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Water-powered hammers at Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet]]\nThe '''tilt hammer''' or '''tail helve hammer''' has a pivot at the centre of the helve on which it is mounted, and is lifted by pushing the opposite end to the head downwards. In practice, the head on such hammers seems to have been limited <!-- in England? -->to one hundredweight (about 50&nbsp;kg), but a very rapid stroke rate was possible. This made it suitable for drawing iron down to small sizes suitable for the cutlery trades.  There were therefore many such forges known as 'tilts' around [[Sheffield]]. They were also used in [[brass]] battery works for making brass (or copper) pots and pans. In battery works (at least) it was possible for one power source to operate several hammers. In Germany, tilt hammers of up to 300&nbsp;kg were used in hammer mills to forge iron. Surviving, working hammers, powered by water wheels, may be seen, for example, at the [[Frohnauer Hammer]] in the [[Ore Mountains]].\n\nThe '''belly helve hammer''' was the kind normally found in a [[finery forge]], used for making [[pig iron]] into forgeable bar iron. This was lifted by cams striking the helve between the pivot and the head. The head usually weighed quarter of a ton. This was probably the case because the strain on a wooden helve would have been too great if the head were heavier.\n\nThe '''nose helve hammer''' seems to have been unusual until the late 18th or early 19th century. This was lifted beyond the head.  Surviving nose helves<ref>For example at [[Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet]]{{dubious|see picture}}</ref> and those in pictures<ref>For example in the metalwork gallery in [[Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery]]</ref> appear to be of cast iron.\n\n=== Demise ===\nThe steam-powered [[drop hammer]] replaced the trip hammer (at least for the largest forgings).  [[James Hall Nasmyth|James Nasmyth]] invented it in 1839 and [[patent]]ed in 1842.  However, by then forging had become less important for the iron industry, following the improvements to the [[rolling mill]] that went along with the adoption of [[puddling (metallurgy)|puddling]] from the end of the 18th century.  Nevertheless, hammers continued to be needed for [[shingling]].\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet]]\n*[[Dorfchemnitz Iron Hammer Mill]]\n*[[Finch Foundry]]\n*[[Freibergsdorf Hammer Mill]]\n*[[Frohnauer Hammer Mill]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|33em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*Sim, David and Ridge, Isable: \"Iron for the Eagles\" (2002)\n*Burnham, Barry C.: \"Dolaucothi-Pumsaint: Survey and Excavations at a Roman Gold-mining Complex\" (2004)\n*Lewis, M.J.T.: \"Millstone and Hammer: the Origins of Water Power\" (1997)\n*Needham, Joseph; Wang, Ling.

Traditional uses of trip hammers include pounding, [[wikt:decorticate|decorticating]] and polishing of grain in [[agriculture]]. In [[mining]], trip hammers were used for crushing metal [[ore]]s into small pieces, although a [[stamp mill]] was more usual for this. In [[finery forge]]s they were used for drawing out [[bloomery|blooms]] made from [[wrought iron]] into more workable [[Wrought iron|bar iron]]. They were also used for fabricating various articles of [[wrought iron]], [[latten]] (an early form of [[brass]]), [[steel]] and other metals.\n\nOne or more trip hammers were set up in a [[forge]], also known variously as a [[hammer mill]], hammer forge or hammer works. The hammers were usually raised by a [[cam]] and then released to fall under the force of [[Gravitation|gravity]]. Historically, trip hammers were often powered [[Hydropower|hydraulically]] by a [[water wheel]]. \n\nTrip hammers are known to have been used in [[Imperial China]] since the [[Western Han dynasty]]. They also existed in the contemporary [[Greco-Roman world]], with more evidence of their use in [[medieval Europe]] during the 12th century. During the [[Industrial Revolution]] the trip hammer fell out of favor and was replaced with the [[power hammer]]. Often multiple hammers were powered via a set of [[line shaft]]s, pulleys and belts from a centrally located power supply.\n\n==Early history==\n\n===China===\n[[File:Hydraulic-Powdered Trip Hammers.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Hydrodynamic powered trip hammer set, illustration from the ''Tiangong Kaiwu'' encyclopedia of 1637, written by [[Song Yingxing]] (1587\u20131666)]]\nIn ancient China, the trip hammer evolved out of the use of the [[mortar and pestle]], which in turn gave rise to the treadle-operated tilt-hammer ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: \u7893 [[Pinyin]]: ''dui''; [[Wade-Giles]]: ''tui'').<ref name=\"neehdam volume 4 part 2 183\" >Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 183.</ref> The latter was a simple device employing a lever and fulcrum (operated by pressure applied by the weight of one's foot to one end), which featured a series of catches or lugs on the main revolving shaft as well.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 390\">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 390.</ref> This device enabled the labor of pounding, often in the decorticating and polishing of grain, and avoided manual use of pounding with hand and arm. Although historians assert that its origins may span as far back as the [[Zhou Dynasty]] (1050 BC\u2013221 BC), the earliest texts to describe the device are the ''[[Jijiupian]]'' dictionary of 40 BC, [[Yang Xiong (author)|Yang Xiong]]'s text known as the ''[[Fangyan]]'' of 15 BC, as well as the ''Xin Lun'' written by [[Huan Tan]] about 20 AD (during the usurpation of [[Wang Mang]]).<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 184\" >Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 184.</ref> The latter book states that the legendary mythological king known as [[Fu Xi]] was the one responsible for the pestle and mortar (which evolved into the tilt-hammer and then trip hammer device). Although the author speaks of the mythological Fu Xi, a passage of his writing gives hint that the waterwheel and trip-hammer were in widespread use by the 1st century AD in China (for water-powered Chinese [[metallurgy]], see [[Du Shi]]):\n\n<blockquote>Fu Hsi invented the pestle and mortar, which is so useful, and later on it was cleverly improved in such a way that the whole weight of the body could be used for treading on the tilt-hammer (tui), thus increasing the efficiency ten times. Afterwards the power of animals\u2014donkeys, mules, oxen, and horses\u2014was applied by means of machinery, and water-power too used for pounding, so that the benefit was increased a hundredfold.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 392\">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 392.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nWith his description, it is seen that the out-of-date Chinese term for pestle and mortar (dui, tui) would soon be replaced with the Chinese term for the water-powered trip-hammer ({{zh|links=no|c=\u6c34\u7893|p=shu\u01d0 du\u00ec|w=shui tui}}.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 390\"/> The [[Han Dynasty]] scholar and poet [[Ma Rong]] (79\u2013166 AD) mentioned in one of his poems of hammers 'pounding in the water-echoing caves'.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 392\"/> As described in the ''[[Hou Han Shu]]'', in 129 AD the official [[Yu Xu (official)|Yu Xu]] gave a report to [[Emperor Shun of Han]] that trip hammers were being exported from Han China to the Western [[Qiang people]] by way of canals through the [[Qilian Mountains]].<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 392\"/> In his ''Rou Xing Lun'', the government official [[Kong Rong]] (153\u2013208 AD) remarked that the invention of the trip hammer was an excellent example of a product created by intelligent men during his own age (comparing the relative achievements of the sages of old).<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 392\"/> During the 3rd century AD, the high government official and engineer [[Du Yu]] established the use of combined trip hammer batteries (lian zhi dui), which employed several shafts that were arranged to work off one large waterwheel.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 393\">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 393.</ref> In Chinese texts of the 4th century, there are written accounts of men possessing and operating hundreds of trip hammer machines, such as the venerable mathematician Wang Rong (died 306 AD), Deng Yu (died 326 AD), and Shi Chong (died 300 AD), responsible for the operation of hundreds of trip hammers in over thirty governmental districts throughout China.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 392-393\">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 392-393.</ref> There are numerous references to trip hammers during the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618\u2013907 AD) and [[Song Dynasty]] (960\u20131279), and there are [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368\u20131644) references that report the use of trip hammers in [[papermill]]s of [[Fujian]] Province.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 394\">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 394.</ref>\n\nAlthough Chinese trip hammers in China were sometimes powered by the more efficient vertical-set waterwheel, the Chinese often employed the horizontal-set waterwheel in operating trip hammers, along with recumbent hammers.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 391 392\">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 391\u2013392.</ref> The recumbent hammer was found in Chinese illustrations by 1313 AD, with the publishing of [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]]'s ''Nong Shu'' book on ancient and contemporary (medieval) metallurgy in China.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 395\">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 395.</ref> There were also illustrations of trip hammers in an encyclopedia of 1637, written by [[Song Yingxing]] (1587\u20131666).<ref name=\"Song 91 93\">Song, 91\u201393.</ref>\n\n=== Greco-Roman world ===\n[[File:Carreg Pumsaint - geograph.org.uk - 396874.jpg|thumb|The regular indentations on the [[Dolaucothi Gold Mines#Carreg Pumsaint|Carreg Pumsaint]] and similar mortar blocks are believed to stem from mechanically-operated trip hammers.<ref name=\"Barry C.

Their use was described in medieval written sources of [[Styria]] (in modern-day Austria), written in 1135 and another in 1175 AD.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 379\" >Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 379.</ref> Medieval French sources of the years 1116 and 1249 both record the use of mechanised trip hammers used in the forging of [[wrought iron]].<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 379\"/> Medieval European trip hammers by the 15th century were most often in the shape of the vertical pestle stamp-mill, although they employed more frequent use of the vertical waterwheel than earlier Chinese versions (which often used the horizontal waterwheel).<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 394\" /> The well-known [[Renaissance]] artist and inventor [[Leonardo da Vinci]] often sketched trip hammers for use in forges and even file-cutting machinery, those of the vertical pestle stamp-mill type.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 395\"/> The oldest depicted European illustration of a [[martinet]] forge-hammer is perhaps the [[Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus]] of [[Olaus Magnus]], dated to 1565 AD.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 395\"/> In this woodcut image, there is the scene of three martinets and a waterwheel working wood and leather bellows of the [[Osmund Bloomery]] furnace.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 395\"/> The recumbent hammer was first depicted in European artwork in an illustration by [[Joachim von Sandrart|Sandrart]] and [[Zonca]] (dated 1621 AD).<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 395\"/>\n\n==Types==\nA trip hammer has the head mounted at the end of a recumbent [[wikt:helve#Noun|helve]], hence the alternative name of helve hammer.  The choice of which type was used in a particular context may have depended on the strain that its operation imposed on the helve.  This was normally of wood, mounted in a cast iron ring (called the hurst) where it pivoted.  However, in the 19th century the heaviest helves were sometimes a single casting, incorporating the hurst.\n\n[[File:Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet - Tilt Hammers - geograph.org.uk - 2425530.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Water-powered hammers at Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet]]\nThe '''tilt hammer''' or '''tail helve hammer''' has a pivot at the centre of the helve on which it is mounted, and is lifted by pushing the opposite end to the head downwards. In practice, the head on such hammers seems to have been limited <!-- in England? -->to one hundredweight (about 50&nbsp;kg), but a very rapid stroke rate was possible. This made it suitable for drawing iron down to small sizes suitable for the cutlery trades.  There were therefore many such forges known as 'tilts' around [[Sheffield]]. They were also used in [[brass]] battery works for making brass (or copper) pots and pans. In battery works (at least) it was possible for one power source to operate several hammers. In Germany, tilt hammers of up to 300&nbsp;kg were used in hammer mills to forge iron. Surviving, working hammers, powered by water wheels, may be seen, for example, at the [[Frohnauer Hammer]] in the [[Ore Mountains]].\n\nThe '''belly helve hammer''' was the kind normally found in a [[finery forge]], used for making [[pig iron]] into forgeable bar iron. This was lifted by cams striking the helve between the pivot and the head. The head usually weighed quarter of a ton. This was probably the case because the strain on a wooden helve would have been too great if the head were heavier.\n\nThe '''nose helve hammer''' seems to have been unusual until the late 18th or early 19th century. This was lifted beyond the head.  Surviving nose helves<ref>For example at [[Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet]]</ref> and those in pictures<ref>For example in the metalwork gallery in [[Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery]]</ref> appear to be of cast iron.\n\n=== Demise ===\nThe steam-powered [[drop hammer]] replaced the trip hammer (at least for the largest forgings).  [[James Hall Nasmyth|James Nasmyth]] invented it in 1839 and [[patent]]ed in 1842.  However, by then forging had become less important for the iron industry, following the improvements to the [[rolling mill]] that went along with the adoption of [[puddling (metallurgy)|puddling]] from the end of the 18th century.  Nevertheless, hammers continued to be needed for [[shingling]].\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet]]\n*[[Dorfchemnitz Iron Hammer Mill]]\n*[[Finch Foundry]]\n*[[Freibergsdorf Hammer Mill]]\n*[[Frohnauer Hammer Mill]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|33em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*Sim, David and Ridge, Isable: \"Iron for the Eagles\" (2002)\n*Burnham, Barry C.: \"Dolaucothi-Pumsaint: Survey and Excavations at a Roman Gold-mining Complex\" (2004)\n*Lewis, M.J.T.: \"Millstone and Hammer: the Origins of Water Power\" (1997)\n*Needham, Joseph; Wang, Ling.

It is a multi-purpose mid-power [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] with increased [[Ballistics|ballistic]] performance over the [[AR-15]]'s traditional [[.223 Remington]] ([[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]]) cartridge requiring only a new [[Gun barrel|barrel]] to upgrade/convert any 5.56-based firearm to .277 Wolverine.<ref name=\"WPI-blog\">{{cite web|last1=Hull|first1=John|title=The .277 Wolverine: Birth of a Wildcat|url=http://blog.westernpowders.com/2014/12/the-277-wolverine-birth-of-a-wildcat|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312194421/http://blog.westernpowders.com/2014/12/the-277-wolverine-birth-of-a-wildcat/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2015-03-12|website=WesternPowders.com|publisher=Western Powders, Inc|accessdate=2015-12-31}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}\nFor fundamentally the same reasons that a .277 inch (7.04&nbsp;mm) diameter [[bullet]] was selected for the [[6.8mm Remington SPC]] (i.e., ideal mass-to-diameter-to-length for mid-weight bullets constrained to loading in an AR-15/M16 [[STANAG magazine]]), selected 6.8mm as the basis for a new [[ArmaLite AR-15|AR-15]] wildcat. Like the [[.300 AAC Blackout]] and unlike the 6.8 SPC and other \"larger bore\" AR-15 cartridges, the .277 Wolverine is based on the widely available 5.56\u00d745mm parent case. Therefore, rifle components such as the [[Bolt (firearms)|bolt]] and [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]] are interchangeable between 5.56\u00d745mm and .277 Wolverine firearms, and standard AR-15 magazines can be used with no loss of capacity. A new barrel is the minimum required component to convert a standard AR-15 to .277 Wolverine.\n\nIn order to load heavier (therefore longer) bullets to magazine length without the problems of seating the bullet's ogive into the case mouth, the Wolverine case is shortened to approximately 39&nbsp;mm from its 45&nbsp;mm parent brass. The case is resized and formed in a single-step operation to create new 23-[[Degree (angle)|degree]] shoulder and larger neck.\n\nInitial design focused on optimal performance with [[supersonic]] bullets in the 85-115&nbsp;[[Grain (unit)|gr]] (5.5-7.5&nbsp;[[Gram|g]]) class, therefore a 1:11 twist rate barrel with 5R rifling was selected.  Subsequent consumer interest in firing \"heavy-for-caliber\" [[speed of sound|subsonic]] bullets led to the design, testing, and production of 1:7 twist barrels to stabilize the longer heavier bullets.\n\n==Development==\nInitially developed, tested, and marketed as a proprietary cartridge, MDWS publicly released the detailed chamber and headspace gage specifications/drawings for the .277 Wolverine in June 2015.\n\nAt least four commercial manufacturers have produced .277 Wolverine barrels, mostly for AR-15 conversions \u2013 although MDWS also sells barrels for Savage and Remington bolt-action rifles.  Barrel manufacturers include: X-Caliber, McGowen, AR Precision, and PAC-NOR.  By the end of April 2016, more than 1,000 .277 Wolverine barrels had been sold, with more than 2,000 by mid-November 2017.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  Barrels lengths include: 8.2, 10.5, 12.5, and 14.5 inch pistol; 16, 18, and 20 inch rifle.\n\n.277 Wolverine cases are easily made by the hobbyist reloader from plentiful and inexpensive 5.56\u00d745mm brass (shortened and resized). Extensive reloading data (including chronographed velocity, accuracy, and ballistic gel testing) is available.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  Ready-to-load brass and/or loaded ammunition is available commercially from several sources including: JB's Firearms, LLC and OutdoorShooterSupply.  Reloading dies and tools are available from Hornady, Lee Precision, Sheridan Engineering, CH4D, and Little Crow Gun Works.<ref name=\"MDWS-home\" /> The fire-formed .277 Wolverine case holds approximately 27.5-27.8 gr of water, compared to 28.5-28.8 gr for the parent case.\n\nIn October 2017, Starline produced 50,000 newly manufactured cases head-stamped \".277 WLV\" for MDWS; all were sold in under 72 hours of posting. Starline lists the .277 Wolverine on their website as a standard offering.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wolverine Starline Factory Brass|url=https://www.starlinebrass.com/brass-cases/277-Wolverine/|website=Starline Brass|publisher=Starline Brass|accessdate=2017-11-28}}</ref>{{secondary source needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Performance==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}\nThe .277 Wolverine has shown comparable performance to the 6.8 SPC with 110&nbsp;gr (7.13&nbsp;g) bullets, achieving similar [[Muzzle velocity|muzzle velocities]] of 2,500&nbsp;fps (762&nbsp;m/s) vs. 2,700&nbsp;fps (823&nbsp;m/s).  The smaller case of the .277 Wolverine (compared to the 6.8 SPC) is more efficient and has less [[recoil]] due to its smaller [[propellant]] load.  With lighter bullets, 80-90&nbsp;gr (5.2-5.8&nbsp;g), although slower than typical 5.56\u00d745mm rounds, the .277 Wolverine provides substantially increased energy due to greater mass. For example, 60-62&nbsp;gr (3.9-4.0&nbsp;g) bullets from a 5.56\u00d745mm round typically provide less than 1,200&nbsp;ft\u00b7lbs (1,627&nbsp;[[Joule|J]]) of [[kinetic energy|energy]], while 85-90&nbsp;gr (5.5-5.8&nbsp;g) bullets from a .277 Wolverine round provide over 1,500&nbsp;ft\u00b7lbs (2,034&nbsp;J) of energy (both at the muzzle of a 16-inch barrel).\n\nThere are always trade-offs between cartridge size, bullet diameter and weight, muzzle velocity, and energy on-target (at any given range).

It is a multi-purpose mid-power [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] with increased [[Ballistics|ballistic]] performance over the [[AR-15]]'s traditional [[.223 Remington]] ([[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]]) cartridge requiring only a new [[Gun barrel|barrel]] to upgrade/convert any 5.56-based firearm to .277 Wolverine.<ref name=\"WPI-blog\">{{cite web|last1=Hull|first1=John|title=The .277 Wolverine: Birth of a Wildcat|url=http://blog.westernpowders.com/2014/12/the-277-wolverine-birth-of-a-wildcat|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312194421/http://blog.westernpowders.com/2014/12/the-277-wolverine-birth-of-a-wildcat/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2015-03-12|website=WesternPowders.com|publisher=Western Powders, Inc|accessdate=2015-12-31}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}\nFor fundamentally the same reasons that a .277 inch (7.04&nbsp;mm) diameter [[bullet]] was selected for the [[6.8mm Remington SPC]] (i.e., ideal mass-to-diameter-to-length for mid-weight bullets constrained to loading in an AR-15/M16 [[STANAG magazine]]), selected 6.8mm as the basis for a new [[ArmaLite AR-15|AR-15]] wildcat. Like the [[.300 AAC Blackout]] and unlike the 6.8 SPC and other \"larger bore\" AR-15 cartridges, the .277 Wolverine is based on the widely available 5.56\u00d745mm parent case. Therefore, rifle components such as the [[Bolt (firearms)|bolt]] and [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]] are interchangeable between 5.56\u00d745mm and .277 Wolverine firearms, and standard AR-15 magazines can be used with no loss of capacity. A new barrel is the minimum required component to convert a standard AR-15 to .277 Wolverine.\n\nIn order to load heavier (therefore longer) bullets to magazine length without the problems of seating the bullet\u2019s ogive into the case mouth, the Wolverine case is shortened to approximately 39&nbsp;mm from its 45&nbsp;mm parent brass. The case is resized and formed in a single-step operation to create new 23-[[Degree (angle)|degree]] shoulder and larger neck.\n\nInitial design focused on optimal performance with [[supersonic]] bullets in the 85-115&nbsp;[[Grain (unit)|gr]] (5.5-7.5&nbsp;[[Gram|g]]) class, therefore a 1:11 twist rate barrel with 5R rifling was selected.  Subsequent consumer interest in firing \"heavy-for-caliber\" [[speed of sound|subsonic]] bullets led to the design, testing, and production of 1:7 twist barrels to stabilize the longer heavier bullets.\n\n==Development==\nInitially developed, tested, and marketed as a proprietary cartridge, MDWS publicly released the detailed chamber and headspace gage specifications/drawings for the .277 Wolverine in June 2015.\n\nAt least four commercial manufacturers have produced .277 Wolverine barrels, mostly for AR-15 conversions \u2013 although MDWS also sells barrels for Savage and Remington bolt-action rifles.  Barrel manufacturers include: X-Caliber, McGowen, AR Precision, and PAC-NOR.  By the end of April 2016, more than 1,000 .277 Wolverine barrels had been sold, with more than 2,000 by mid-November 2017.{{cn|date=March 2019}}  Barrels lengths include: 8.2, 10.5, 12.5, and 14.5 inch pistol; 16, 18, and 20 inch rifle.\n\n.277 Wolverine cases are easily made by the hobbyist reloader from plentiful and inexpensive 5.56\u00d745mm brass (shortened and resized). Extensive reloading data (including chronographed velocity, accuracy, and ballistic gel testing) is available.{{cn|date=March 2019}}  Ready-to-load brass and/or loaded ammunition is available commercially from several sources including: JB's Firearms, LLC and OutdoorShooterSupply.  Reloading dies and tools are available from Hornady, Lee Precision, Sheridan Engineering, CH4D, and Little Crow Gun Works.<ref name=\"MDWS-home\" /> The fire-formed .277 Wolverine case holds approximately 27.5-27.8 gr of water, compared to 28.5-28.8 gr for the parent case.\n\nIn October 2017, Starline produced 50,000 newly manufactured cases head-stamped \".277 WLV\" for MDWS; all were sold in under 72 hours of posting. Starline lists the .277 Wolverine on their website as a standard offering.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wolverine Starline Factory Brass|url=https://www.starlinebrass.com/brass-cases/277-Wolverine/|website=Starline Brass|publisher=Starline Brass|accessdate=2017-11-28}}</ref>{{secondary source needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Performance==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}\nThe .277 Wolverine has shown comparable performance to the 6.8 SPC with 110&nbsp;gr (7.13&nbsp;g) bullets, achieving similar [[Muzzle velocity|muzzle velocities]] of 2,500&nbsp;fps (762&nbsp;m/s) vs. 2,700&nbsp;fps (823&nbsp;m/s).  The smaller case of the .277 Wolverine (compared to the 6.8 SPC) is more efficient and has less [[recoil]] due to its smaller [[propellant]] load.  With lighter bullets, 80-90&nbsp;gr (5.2-5.8&nbsp;g), although slower than typical 5.56\u00d745mm rounds, the .277 Wolverine provides substantially increased energy due to greater mass. For example, 60-62&nbsp;gr (3.9-4.0&nbsp;g) bullets from a 5.56\u00d745mm round typically provide less than 1,200&nbsp;ft\u00b7lbs (1,627&nbsp;[[Joule|J]]) of [[kinetic energy|energy]], while 85-90&nbsp;gr (5.5-5.8&nbsp;g) bullets from a .277 Wolverine round provide over 1,500&nbsp;ft\u00b7lbs (2,034&nbsp;J) of energy (both at the muzzle of a 16-inch barrel).\n\nThere are always trade-offs between cartridge size, bullet diameter and weight, muzzle velocity, and energy on-target (at any given range). The .277 Wolverine will never replace larger high-power cartridges such as the [[.308 Winchester]] ([[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]]) or [[.270 Winchester]] for long range shooting; however \u2013 it outperforms the .223 Remington at typical hunting ranges and approaches the 6.8 SPC while using less expensive components (brass, magazines, bolt, less powder per load).\n\nThe following table provides comparative performance data for several factory cartridges in the mid-power AR-15 class:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

When in June 1988 an \"Islamic way of life\" was proclaimed for Bangladesh by constitutional amendment, very little attention was paid outside the intellectual class to the meaning and impact of such an important national commitment. However, most observers believed that the declaration of Islam as the state religion might have a significant impact on national life. Aside from arousing the suspicion of the non-Islamic minorities, it could accelerate the proliferation of religious parties at both the national and the local levels, thereby exacerbating tension and conflict between secular and religious politicians. Unrest of this nature was reported on some college campuses soon after the amendment was promulgated.<ref>{{cite book |date=1989 |editor1-last=Heitzman |editor1-first=James |editor2-last=Worden |editor2-first=Robert |chapter=Islam in Bangladesh |chapter-url=http://countrystudies.us/bangladesh/39.htm |title=Bangladesh: A Country Study |url=http://countrystudies.us/bangladesh/ |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Federal Research Division, Library of Congress |page=78}}</ref>\n\n=== Islamic architecture in Bangladesh ===\n[[Image:Khan Mohammad Mirdha's Mosque.JPG|thumb|[[Khan Mohammad Mirdha's Mosque]] in Dhaka, built in 1706 (18th century old mosque).]]\n\n==== Mosques ====\n{{Main|List of mosques in Bangladesh}}\nBangladesh has a vast amount of historic mosques with its own Islamic architecture.\n* [[Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas|Abu Aqqas]] Mosque-648<ref name=dn>{{cite news |date=2012-12-21 |title=History and archaeology: Bangladesh's most undervalued assets? |url=http://www.deutschenews24.de/english/detailsnews.php?nssl=7cbbc409ec990f19c78c75bd1e06f215&nttl=2012122106445070 |work=deutschenews24.de |agency= |access-date=2014-06-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315074959/http://deutschenews24.de/english/detailsnews.php?nssl=7cbbc409ec990f19c78c75bd1e06f215&nttl=2012122106445070 |archive-date=2014-03-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=pa>{{cite news |last=Mahmood |first=Kajal Iftikhar Rashid |date=2012-10-19 |script-title=bn:\u09b8\u09be\u09a1\u09bc\u09c7 \u09a4\u09c7\u09b0\u09cb \u09b6 \u09ac\u099b\u09b0 \u0986\u0997\u09c7\u09b0 \u09ae\u09b8\u099c\u09bf\u09a6 |title= |trans-title=1350 Year-old Mosque |url=http://archive.prothom-alo.com/detail/news/299066 |language=bn |newspaper=Prothom Alo}}</ref>\n* [[Shahbaz Khan Mosque]]-1679\n* [[Shona Mosque]]-1493\n* [[Bagha Mosque]]-1523\n* [[Khan Mohammad Mridha Mosque]]-1703\n* [[Sixty Dome Mosque]] -15th century\n\n===== Modern mosques =====\n\n==== Tombs and mausoleums ====\n[[Lalbagh Fort|<nowiki/>]] [[Lalbagh]] Fort-1664\n\n== Law and politics ==\n{{multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{Disputed section|date=February 2014}}\n{{Expand section|1=examples and additional citations|date=February 2014}}\n}}\n\n[[Image:Dhakaislamistrally (68).JPG|thumb|250px|Muslim students rally in [[Dhaka]], protesting closures of madrasas]]\n\n===Legal issues===\nIn Bangladesh, where a modified Anglo-Indian civil and criminal legal system operates, there are no official sharia courts.

The Ministry of Religious Affairs provided support, financial assistance, and endowments to religious institutions, including mosques and community prayer grounds (idgahs). The organization of [[Hajj|annual pilgrimages to Mecca]] also came under the auspices of the ministry because of limits on the number of pilgrims admitted by the government of [[Saudi Arabia]] and the restrictive foreign exchange regulations of the government of Bangladesh. The ministry also directed the policy and the program of the [[Islamic Foundation Bangladesh]], which was responsible for organizing and supporting research and publications on Islamic subjects. The foundation also maintains the [[Baitul Mukarram]] (National Mosque), and organized the training of imams. Some 18,000 imams were scheduled for training once the government completed establishment of a national network of Islamic cultural centers and mosque libraries. Under the patronage of the Islamic Foundation, an encyclopedia of Islam in the Bengali language was being compiled in the late 1980s.<ref name=CountryStudy>{{cite book |date=1989 |editor1-last=Heitzman |editor1-first=James |editor2-last=Worden |editor2-first=Robert |chapter=Islam in Bangladesh |chapter-url=http://countrystudies.us/bangladesh/39.htm |title=Bangladesh: A Country Study |url=http://countrystudies.us/bangladesh/ |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Federal Research Division, Library of Congress |page=77}}</ref>\n\nAnother step toward further government involvement in religious life was taken in 1984 when the semiofficial [[Zakat]] Fund Committee was established under the chairmanship of the president of Bangladesh. The committee solicited annual zakat contributions on a voluntary basis. The revenue so generated was to be spent on orphanages, schools, children's hospitals, and other charitable institutions and projects. Commercial banks and other financial institutions were encouraged to contribute to the fund. Through these measures the government sought closer ties with religious establishments within the country and with Islamic countries such as [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Pakistan]].<ref name=CountryStudy/>\n\n==Leaders and organizations==\nThe members of the Ulama include [[Mawl\u0101n\u0101]], [[Imams]], [[Ulama]] and [[Muftis]].

However, the present government, led by [[Bangladesh Awami League]] strongly propagates secularism and respect towards other religions. Despite all Bangladeshis saying that religion is an important part of their daily lives, Bangladesh's Awami League won a landslide victory in 2008 on a platform of secularism, reform, and a suppression of radical Islamist groups. According to a Gallup poll conducted in 2009, simultaneous strong support of the secular Awami League and the near unanimous importance of religion in daily life suggests that while religion is vital in Bangladeshis' daily lives, they appear comfortable with its lack of influence in government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/121937/religion-secularism-working-tandem-bangladesh.aspx |title=Religion, Secularism Working in Tandem in Bangladesh |date=2009-07-29 |website=Gallup |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books\n |1=Islamic Mythology\n |3=The Supernatural in Islam\n}}\n{{Wikipedia books\n |1=Islam\n |3=Quran\n |5=Hadith\n |7=Sahabah\n |9=Angels in Islam\n}}\n{{Portal|Bangladesh|Islam}}\n* [[Islam in South Asia]]\n* [[Islam by country]]\n* [[Muslim Population by District in West Bengal]]\n*The Rise of Islam and The Bengal Frontier\u200c \u2192 https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft067n99v9&chunk.id=ch010&toc.depth=1&toc.id=ch010&brand=ucpress\n\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{loc}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite book |last=Eaton |first=Richard M. |year=1993 |title=The Rise of Islam and the Bengal Frontier, 1204-1760 |url=https://archive.org/details/riseofislambenga00eato |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-20507-3 |url-access=registration }}\n* {{cite book |last=Karim |first=Abdul |year=2012 |chapter=Islam, Bengal |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Islam,_Bengal |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}\n* [http://www.gtz.de/de/dokumente/en-Development_Cooperation-and-Islam-in-Bangladesch.pdf Development Cooperation and Islamic values in Bangladesh]\n* US State Department [https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2004/35514.htm]\n\n{{Religion in Bangladesh topics}}\n\n{{Asia in topic|Islam in}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Islam In Bangladesh}}\n[[Category:Islam in Bangladesh| ]]\n[[Category:Islam by country|Bangladesh]]\n", "text_old": "{{infobox religious group\n| group      = Bangladeshi Muslims <br>\n(\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0646\u063a\u0644\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0634\u064a\u0648\u0646, \u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be\u09a6\u09c7\u09b6\u09c0 \u09ae\u09c1\u09b8\u09b2\u09ae\u09be\u09a8\u0997\u09a3)\n| population = {{Circa|'''152 million'''|lk=yes}} (90.39%)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/256513.pdf|title=Bangladesh 2015 International Religiou Freedom Report |last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. Department of State |access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/08/09/the-worlds-muslims-unity-and-diversity-1-religious-affiliation/#identity|title=Chapter 1: Religious Affiliation |date=9 August 2012 |work=The World's Muslims: Unity and Diversity|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]'s Religion & Public Life Project|access-date=4 September 2013}}</ref>\n| regions    = Throughout Bangladesh\n| religions  = Predominantly [[Sunni]]<br> <small>minority: [[non-denominational Muslims]], [[Shia]]<small/>\n| languages  = {{Plainlist|\n*'''Official and national language'''<br>{{Hlist|[[Bengali language|Bengali]]}}\n*'''Minority languages'''<br>{{Hlist|[[Urdu]]}}\n*'''Sacred language'''<br>{{Hlist|[[Arabic]]<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Al-Jallad |first=Ahmad |title=Polygenesis in the Arabic Dialects |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Arabic Language and Linguistics |url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopedia-of-arabic-language-and-linguistics/polygenesis-in-the-arabic-dialects-EALL_SIM_000030?s.num=1&s.f.s2_parent=s.f.book.encyclopedia-of-arabic-language-and-linguistics&s.q=neo-arabic |date= 2011-05-30|publisher=BRILL |isbn=9789004177024 |doi=10.1163/1570-6699_eall_EALL_SIM_000030}}</ref>}}\n}}\n}}\n{{Islam in Bangladesh}}\n{{Islam by country}}\n[[Bangladesh]] is a Muslim majority nation and Islam is the [[state religion]] of the People's Republic of Bangladesh.<ref name=\"aljazeera:1\">{{cite web |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/03/bangladesh-court-upholds-islam-religion-state-160328112919301.html |title=Bangladesh court upholds Islam as religion of the state |last=Bergman |first=David |date=28 Mar 2016 |publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]}}</ref><ref name=\"reuters:1\">{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bangladesh-islam-state/bangladesh-dismisses-case-to-drop-islam-as-state-religion-idUSKCN0WU0UT |title=Bangladesh dismisses case to drop Islam as state religion |date=28 March 2016 |publisher=[[Reuters]]}}</ref> The [[Muslim]] population was approximately 152 million, constituting 90% of the total population as of 2011<ref>[http://features.pewforum.org/muslim-population-graphic/#/Bangladesh Bangladesh -

When in June 1988 an \"Islamic way of life\" was proclaimed for Bangladesh by constitutional amendment, very little attention was paid outside the intellectual class to the meaning and impact of such an important national commitment. However, most observers believed that the declaration of Islam as the state religion might have a significant impact on national life. Aside from arousing the suspicion of the non-Islamic minorities, it could accelerate the proliferation of religious parties at both the national and the local levels, thereby exacerbating tension and conflict between secular and religious politicians. Unrest of this nature was reported on some college campuses soon after the amendment was promulgated.<ref>{{cite book |date=1989 |editor1-last=Heitzman |editor1-first=James |editor2-last=Worden |editor2-first=Robert |chapter=Islam in Bangladesh |chapter-url=http://countrystudies.us/bangladesh/39.htm |title=Bangladesh: A Country Study |url=http://countrystudies.us/bangladesh/ |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Federal Research Division, Library of Congress |page=78}}</ref>\n\n=== Islamic architecture in Bangladesh ===\n[[Image:Khan Mohammad Mirdha's Mosque.JPG|thumb|[[Khan Mohammad Mirdha's Mosque]] in Dhaka, built in 1706 (18th century old mosque).]]\n\n==== Mosques ====\n{{Main|List of mosques in Bangladesh}}\nBangladesh has a vast amount of historic mosques with its own Islamic architecture.\n* [[Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas|Abu Aqqas]] Mosque-648<ref name=dn>{{cite news |date=2012-12-21 |title=History and archaeology: Bangladesh's most undervalued assets? |url=http://www.deutschenews24.de/english/detailsnews.php?nssl=7cbbc409ec990f19c78c75bd1e06f215&nttl=2012122106445070 |work=deutschenews24.de |agency= |access-date=2014-06-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315074959/http://deutschenews24.de/english/detailsnews.php?nssl=7cbbc409ec990f19c78c75bd1e06f215&nttl=2012122106445070 |archive-date=2014-03-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=pa>{{cite news |last=Mahmood |first=Kajal Iftikhar Rashid |date=2012-10-19 |script-title=bn:\u09b8\u09be\u09a1\u09bc\u09c7 \u09a4\u09c7\u09b0\u09cb \u09b6 \u09ac\u099b\u09b0 \u0986\u0997\u09c7\u09b0 \u09ae\u09b8\u099c\u09bf\u09a6 |title= |trans-title=1350 Year-old Mosque |url=http://archive.prothom-alo.com/detail/news/299066 |language=bn |newspaper=Prothom Alo}}</ref>\n* [[Shahbaz Khan Mosque]]-1679\n* [[Shona Mosque]]-1493\n* [[Bagha Mosque]]-1523\n* [[Khan Mohammad Mridha Mosque]]-1703\n* [[Sixty Dome Mosque]] -15th century\n\n===== Modern mosques =====\n\n==== Tombs and mausoleums ====\n[[Lalbagh Fort|<nowiki/>]] [[Lalbagh]] Fort-1664\n\n== Law and politics ==\n{{multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{Disputed section|date=February 2014}}\n{{Expand section|1=examples and additional citations|date=February 2014}}\n}}\n\n[[Image:Dhakaislamistrally (68).JPG|thumb|250px|Muslim students rally in [[Dhaka]], protesting closures of madrasas]]\n\n===Legal issues===\nIn Bangladesh, where a modified Anglo-Indian civil and criminal legal system operates, there are no official sharia courts.

The Ministry of Religious Affairs provided support, financial assistance, and endowments to religious institutions, including mosques and community prayer grounds (idgahs). The organization of [[Hajj|annual pilgrimages to Mecca]] also came under the auspices of the ministry because of limits on the number of pilgrims admitted by the government of [[Saudi Arabia]] and the restrictive foreign exchange regulations of the government of Bangladesh. The ministry also directed the policy and the program of the [[Islamic Foundation Bangladesh]], which was responsible for organizing and supporting research and publications on Islamic subjects. The foundation also maintains the [[Baitul Mukarram]] (National Mosque), and organized the training of imams. Some 18,000 imams were scheduled for training once the government completed establishment of a national network of Islamic cultural centers and mosque libraries. Under the patronage of the Islamic Foundation, an encyclopedia of Islam in the Bengali language was being compiled in the late 1980s.<ref name=CountryStudy>{{cite book |date=1989 |editor1-last=Heitzman |editor1-first=James |editor2-last=Worden |editor2-first=Robert |chapter=Islam in Bangladesh |chapter-url=http://countrystudies.us/bangladesh/39.htm |title=Bangladesh: A Country Study |url=http://countrystudies.us/bangladesh/ |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Federal Research Division, Library of Congress |page=77}}</ref>\n\nAnother step toward further government involvement in religious life was taken in 1984 when the semiofficial [[Zakat]] Fund Committee was established under the chairmanship of the president of Bangladesh. The committee solicited annual zakat contributions on a voluntary basis. The revenue so generated was to be spent on orphanages, schools, children's hospitals, and other charitable institutions and projects. Commercial banks and other financial institutions were encouraged to contribute to the fund. Through these measures the government sought closer ties with religious establishments within the country and with Islamic countries such as [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Pakistan]].<ref name=CountryStudy/>\n\n==Leaders and organizations==\nThe members of the Ulama include [[Mawl\u0101n\u0101]], [[Imams]], [[Ulama]] and [[Muftis]].

However, the present government, led by [[Bangladesh Awami League]] strongly propagates secularism and respect towards other religions. Despite all Bangladeshis saying that religion is an important part of their daily lives, Bangladesh's Awami League won a landslide victory in 2008 on a platform of secularism, reform, and a suppression of radical Islamist groups. According to a Gallup poll conducted in 2009, simultaneous strong support of the secular Awami League and the near unanimous importance of religion in daily life suggests that while religion is vital in Bangladeshis' daily lives, they appear comfortable with its lack of influence in government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/121937/religion-secularism-working-tandem-bangladesh.aspx |title=Religion, Secularism Working in Tandem in Bangladesh |date=2009-07-29 |website=Gallup |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books\n |1=Islamic Mythology\n |3=The Supernatural in Islam\n}}\n{{Wikipedia books\n |1=Islam\n |3=Quran\n |5=Hadith\n |7=Sahabah\n |9=Angels in Islam\n}}\n{{Portal|Bangladesh|Islam}}\n* [[Islam in South Asia]]\n* [[Islam by country]]\n* [[Muslim Population by District in West Bengal]]\n*The Rise of Islam and The Bengal Frontier\u200c \u2192 https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft067n99v9&chunk.id=ch010&toc.depth=1&toc.id=ch010&brand=ucpress\n\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{loc}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite book |last=Eaton |first=Richard M. |year=1993 |title=The Rise of Islam and the Bengal Frontier, 1204-1760 |url=https://archive.org/details/riseofislambenga00eato |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-20507-3 |url-access=registration }}\n* {{cite book |last=Karim |first=Abdul |year=2012 |chapter=Islam, Bengal |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Islam,_Bengal |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}\n* [http://www.gtz.de/de/dokumente/en-Development_Cooperation-and-Islam-in-Bangladesch.pdf Development Cooperation and Islamic values in Bangladesh]\n* US State Department [https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2004/35514.htm]\n\n{{Religion in Bangladesh topics}}\n\n{{Asia in topic|Islam in}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Islam In Bangladesh}}\n[[Category:Islam in Bangladesh| ]]\n[[Category:Islam by country|Bangladesh]]\n", "name_user": "Tholme", "label": "safe", "comment": "lintfix", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Bangladesh"}

Shia Islam made its way to southern Afghanistan during the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid rule]] in the 16th century. Until [[Mir Wais Hotak]] liberated the Afghans in 1709, the [[Old Kandahar|Kandahar]] region of Afghanistan was often a battleground between the Shia Safavids and the Sunni [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]].\n\n===Conquest by Abdur Rahman Khan===\n[[File:Mosque in Kandahar-2011.jpg|thumb|left|The Friday Mosque in [[Kandahar]]. Adjacent to it is the [[Shrine of the Cloak]] and the tomb of [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]].]]\n\nThe first systematic employment of Islam as an instrument of state-building was initiated by King [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] (1880\u20131901) during his drive toward centralization. He decreed that all laws must comply with Islamic law and thus elevated the Shariah over customary laws embodied in the [[Pashtunwali]]. The [[ulama]] were enlisted to legitimize and sanction his state efforts as well as his central authority. This enhanced the religious community on the one hand, but as they were increasingly inducted into the bureaucracy as servants of the state, the religious leadership was ultimately weakened. Many economic privileges enjoyed by religious personalities and institutions were restructured within the framework of the state; the propagation of learning, once the sole prerogative of the ulama, was closely supervised; and the Amir became the supreme arbiter of justice.\n\n[[File:Men praying in Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|Men [[salat|praying]] at the [[Shrine of Ali|Blue Mosque]] (or Shrine of Ali) in the northern Afghan city of [[Mazar-i-Sharif]]]]\n\nAbdur Rahman Khan's successors continued and expanded his policies as they increased the momentum of secularization. Islam remained central to interactions, but the religious establishment remained essentially non-political, functioning as a moral rather than a political influence. Nevertheless, Islam asserted itself in times of national crisis. Moreover, when the religious leadership considered themselves severely threatened, charismatic religious personalities periodically employed Islam to rally disparate groups in opposition to the state. They rose up on several occasions against King [[Amanullah Shah]] (1919\u20131929), for example, in protest against reforms they believed to be western intrusions inimical to Islam.\n\nSubsequent rulers, mindful of traditional attitudes antithetical to secularization, were careful to underline the compatibility of Islam with modernization. Even so, and despite its pivotal position within the society, which continued to draw no distinction between religion and state, the role of religion in state affairs continued to decline.\n\n[[File:Lashkargah Mosque.jpg|thumb|A mosque in [[Lashkar Gah]], in the south of the country]]\n\nThe 1931 [[Constitution]] made [[Hanafi]] Shariah the state religion, while the 1964 Constitution simply prescribed that the state should conduct its religious ritual according to the Hanafi school. The 1977 Constitution declared Islam the religion of Afghanistan, but made no mention that the state ritual should be Hanafi. The [[Penal Code]] of 1976 and the [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil Code]] of 1977, covering the entire field of social justice, represent major attempts to cope with elements of secular law based on, but superseded by, other systems. Courts, for instance, were enjoined to consider cases first according to secular law, resorting to Shariah in areas secular law did not cover. By 1978, the government of the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA) openly expressed its aversion to the religious establishment. This precipitated the fledgling [[Islamist]] Movement into a national revolt; Islam moved from its passive stance on the periphery to play an active role.\n\n[[File:Kabul Mosque - usual traffic, August 3, 2010 - panoramio.jpg|thumb|[[Abdul Rahman Mosque]] in [[Kabul]], the largest mosque in Afghanistan]]\n\nPoliticized Islam in Afghanistan represents a break from Afghan traditions. The Islamist Movement originated in 1958 among faculties of [[Kabul University]], particularly in the Faculty of Islamic Law, which had been founded in 1952 with the stated purpose of raising the quality of religious teaching to accommodate modern science and technology. The founders <!--of the faculty, or of the Islamic Movement? --> were largely professors influenced by the [[Egypt|Egyptian]] [[Muslim Brotherhood]], a party formed in the 1930s that was dedicated to Islamic revivalism and social, economic, and political equity. Their <!--whose? the founders' or the Muslim Brotherhood's?--> objective is to come to terms with the modern world through the development of a political ideology based on Islam. The Afghan leaders, while indebted to many of these concepts, did not forge strong ties to similar movements in other countries.\n\nThe liberalization of government attitudes following the passage of the 1964 Constitution ushered in a period of intense activism among students at Kabul University. Professors and their students set up the Muslim Youth Organization (Sazmani Jawanani Musulman) in the mid-1960s at the same time that the leftists were also forming many parties. Initially [[communist]] students outnumbered the Muslim students, but by 1970 the Muslim Youth had gained a majority in student elections. Their membership was recruited from university faculties and from secondary schools in several cities such as [[Mazari Sharif]] and [[Herat]]. Some of these professors and students became the leaders of the [[Mujahideen]] rebels in the 1980s.\n\n===Radicalization and NATO presence===\n{{Further|Soviet\u2013Afghan War|War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)}}\nThe 1979 [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet invasion]] in support of a communist government triggered a major intervention of religion into Afghan political conflict, and Islam united the multiethnic political opposition. With the takeover of government by the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan|PDPA]] in April 1978, Islam had already become central to uniting the opposition against the communist ideology of the new rulers. As a politico-religious system, Islam is well-suited to the needs of a diverse, unorganized, often mutually antagonistic citizenry wishing to forge a united front against a common enemy, and war permitted various groups within the [[mujahideen]] to put into effect competing concepts of organization.\n\n[[File:Mujahideen prayer in Shultan Valley Kunar, 1987.jpg|thumb|[[Mujahideen]] praying in [[Kunar Province]] during the 1980s [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]]]]\n\nThe Soviet invasion and the [[Iranian Revolution]] not only led national uprisings but also the importation of foreign radical Muslims to Afghanistan. The mujahideen leaders were charismatic figures with dyadic ties to followers. In many cases military and political leaders replaced the tribal leadership; at times the religious leadership was strengthened; often the religious combined with the political leadership. Followers selected their local leaders on the basis of personal choice and precedence among regions, sects, ethnic groups or tribes, but the major leaders rose to prominence through their ties to outsiders who controlled the resources of money and arms.\n\nWith the support of foreign aid, the mujahideen were ultimately successful in their jihad to drive out the Soviet forces, but not in their attempts to construct a political alternative to govern Afghanistan after their victory. Throughout the war, the mujahideen were never fully able to replace traditional structures with a modern political system based on Islam. Most mujahideen commanders either used traditional patterns of power, becoming the new khans, or sought to adapt modern political structures to the traditional society. In time the prominent leaders accumulated wealth and power and, in contrast to the past, wealth became a determining factor in the delineation of power at all levels.\n\n[[File:Flickr - DVIDSHUB - International brothers, sisters in faith gather at Kandahar Air Field for Eid al-Adha (Image 1 of 10).jpg|thumb|Muslims praying together during an [[Eid al-Adha]] worship service at [[Kandahar International Airport|Kandahar Air Base]] in southern Afghanistan]]\n\nWith the departure of foreign troops and the long sought demise of Kabul's leftist government, The [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] finally came into being in April 1992. This represented a distinct break with Afghan history, for religious specialists had never before exercised state power. But the new government failed to establish its legitimacy and, as much of its financial support dissipated, local and middle range commanders and their militia not only fought among themselves but resorted to a host of unacceptable practices in their protracted scrambles for power and profit. Throughout the nation the populous suffered from harassment, extortion, kidnapping, burglary, hijacking and acts dishonoring women. [[Drug trafficking]] increased alarmingly; nowhere were the highways safe. The mujahideen had forfeited the trust they once enjoyed.\n\nIn the fall of 1994 a group called the [[Taliban]] came forth vowing to cleanse the nation of warlords and criminals. Their intention was to create a \"pure\" Islamic government subject to their own strict interpretations of the [[Shariah]]. Many [[Pakistan]]i politicians supported the Taliban, including [[Sami ul Haq]] who is regarded as the Father of the Taliban. A number of its leaders were one-time mujahideen members, but the bulk of their forces were young [[Afghan refugees]] trained in Pakistani [[madrassa]]s (religious schools), especially those run by the [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam|Jamiat-e Ulema-e Islam Pakistan]], the aggressively conservative Pakistani political religious party headed by [[Fazal-ur-Rehman (politician)|Maulana Fazlur Rahman]], arch rival of [[Qazi Hussain Ahmad]], leader of the equally conservative [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] and longtime supporter of the mujahideen.\n\nHeadquartered in [[Kandahar]], mostly [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]] from the rural areas, and from the top leadership down to the fighting militia characteristically in their thirties or forties and even younger, the Taliban swept the country. In September 1996 they captured Kabul and ruled over most of Afghanistan by 2001. The meteoric take over went almost unchallenged. Arms were collected and security was established. At the same time, acts committed for the purpose of enforcing the Shariah included public executions of murderers, [[stoning]] for adultery, amputation for theft, a ban on all forms of gambling such as [[kite flying]], [[chess]] and [[cockfighting|cockfights]], prohibition of music and videos, proscriptions against pictures of humans and animals, and an embargo on women's voices over the radio. Women were to remain as invisible as possible, behind the veil, in purdah in their homes, and dismissed from work or study outside their homes. They were toppled by a combined Afghan-NATO military force in late 2001. Majority of them escaped to neighboring Pakistan from where they launched [[Taliban insurgency|insurgency]] against the current NATO-backed Afghan government. Peace negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan government was ongoing as of 2013.\n\n==Islam in Afghan society==\nFor Afghans, Islam represents a potentially unifying symbolic system which offsets the divisiveness that frequently rises from the existence of a deep pride in tribal loyalties and an abounding sense of personal and family honor found in multitribal and multiethnic societies such as Afghanistan.\n\n[[File:Afghan men praying in Kunar-2009.jpg|thumb|250px|Afghans conducting their afternoon prayer in Kunar Province (December 2009)]]\n\nIslam is a central, pervasive influence throughout Afghan society; religious observances punctuate the rhythm of each day and season. In addition to a central [[congregational masjid]] for weekly communal prayers which are obligatory for men in Islam (but not for woman) and are generally well attended, smaller community-maintained mosques stand at the center of villages, as well as town and city neighborhoods. [[Masjid]]s serve not only as places of worship, but for a multitude of functions, including shelter for guests, places to meet, the focus of social religious festivities and schools. Almost every Afghan has at one time during his youth studied at a mosque school; for many this is the only formal education they receive.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nBecause Islam is a totalitarian way of life and functions as a comprehensive code of social behavior regulating all human relationships, individual and family status depends on the proper observance of the society's value system based on concepts defined in Islam. These are characterized by [[honesty]], frugality, [[generosity]], virtuousness, piousness, fairness, truthfulness, tolerance and respect for others. To uphold family honor, elders also control the behavior of their children according to these same Islamic prescriptions. At times, even competitive relations between tribal or ethnic groups are expressed in terms claiming religious superiority. In short, Islam structures day-to-day interactions of all members of the community.\n\n[[File:Men praying at Babur Gardens in 2010.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Men [[salat|praying]] inside the [[Bagh-e Babur|Gardens of Babur]] in Kabul]]\n\nThe religious establishment has several levels. Any Muslim can lead informal groups in prayer. [[Mullah]]s who officiate at mosques are normally appointed by the government after consultation with their communities and, although partially financed by the government, mullahs are largely dependent for their livelihood on community contributions including shelter and a portion of the harvest. Supposedly versed in the [[Qur'an]], [[Sunnah]], [[Hadith]] and [[Shariah]], they must ensure that their communities are knowledgeable in the fundamentals of Islamic ritual and behavior. This qualifies them to arbitrate disputes over religious interpretation. Often they function as paid teachers responsible for religious education classes held in mosques where children learn basic moral values and correct ritual practices. Their role has additional social aspects for they officiate on the occasion of life crisis rituals associated with births, marriages and deaths.\n\n[[File:Muslim men praying in Afghanistan-2010.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Politics of Afghanistan|Afghan politicians]] and foreign diplomats praying at the [[Embassy of the United States, Kabul|U.S. Embassy in Kabul]]]]\n\nBut rural mullahs are not part of an institutionalized hierarchy of clergy. Most are part-time mullahs working also as farmers or craftsmen. Some are barely literate, or only slightly more educated than the people they serve. Often, but by no means always, they are men of minimal wealth and, because they depend for their livelihood on the community that appoints them, they have little authority even within their own social boundaries. They are often treated with scant respect and are the butt of a vast body of jokes making fun of their arrogance and ignorance. Yet their role as religious arbiters forces them to take positions on issues that have political ramifications and since mullahs often disagree with one another, pitting one community against the other, they are frequently perceived as disruptive elements within their communities.\n\nVeneration of saints and shrines is opposed by some Islamic groups, particularly those ascribing to the [[Salafi]] or [[Ahle Hadith]]. Nevertheless, Afghanistan's landscape is liberally strewn with shrines honoring saints of all descriptions. Many of Afghanistan's oldest villages and towns grew up around shrines of considerable antiquity. Some are used as sanctuaries by fugitives.\n\nShrines vary in form from simple mounds of earth or stones marked by pennants to lavishly ornamented complexes surrounding a central domed tomb. These large establishments are controlled by prominent religious and secular leaders. Shrines may mark the final resting place of a fallen hero (shahid), a venerated religious teacher, a renowned Sufi poet, or relics, such as a hair of [[Muhammad]] or a piece of his cloak (khirqah). A great many commemorate legends about the miraculous exploits of [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]], the fourth [[caliph]] and the first Imam of Shi'a Islam believed to be buried at the nation's most elaborate shrine located in the heart of Mazari Sharif, the Exalted Shrine. Ali is revered throughout Afghanistan for his role as an intermediary in the face of tyranny.\n\nFestive annual fairs celebrated at shrines attract thousands of pilgrims and bring together all sections of communities. Pilgrims also visit shrines to seek the intercession of the saint for special favors, be it a cure for illness or the birth of a son. Women are particularly devoted to activities associated with shrines. These visits may be short or last several days and many pilgrims carry away specially blessed curative and protective [[amulets]] (usually a [[tawiz]]) to ward off the evil eye, assure loving relationships between husbands and wives and many other forms of solace. Like saint veneration, such practices are generally not encouraged in Islam according to classical understanding of the Holy Qu'ran and Hadiths (prophetic sayings of the Rabi)\n\n==Shia Islam in Afghanistan==\n{{Main|Shia Islam in Afghanistan}}\n[[File:Blue mosaic, Kabul.jpg|thumb|[[Abu Fazl Mosque]] in [[Kabul]] during construction in 2008, the largest [[Shia Islam in Afghanistan|Shia]] mosque in Afghanistan<ref>[https://www.flickr.com/photos/51400588@N06/4726044458/in/photostream/]</ref>]]\n\nRoughly 15% of the [[Demographics of Afghanistan#Population statistics|Afghan population]] practice [[Shia Islam in Afghanistan|Shia Islam]].<ref name=\"Pew\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/08/09/the-worlds-muslims-unity-and-diversity-1-religious-affiliation/#identity|title=Chapter 1: Religious Affiliation|date=August 9, 2012|work=The World\u2019s Muslims: Unity and Diversity|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]'s Religion & Public Life Project|accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Factbook\">{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/af.html |title=People and Society:: Afghanistan |publisher=www.cia.gov |work=[[The World Factbook]] |accessdate=2017-05-22}}</ref> Most Shias in Afghanistan belong to the [[Twelver]] branch. This includes the [[Hazara people|Hazara]] ethnic group and the smaller urbanized [[Qizilbash]] group, who are originally from eastern Iran.\n\nPolitically aware Shia students formed the hardcore of the Afghan [[Maoist]] movement in the 1960s and early 1970s. After the [[Saur Revolution]] (April Revolution) of 1978 and the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979, Shia rebel groups in the [[Hazarajat]] region, although frequently at odds with one another, became active in [[mujahideen]] activities. They were aided by Shi'a Iran and fought against the Soviet-backed Afghan government as well as other mujahideen groups.\n\nDuring the political maneuvering leading up to the establishment of the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] in 1992, the Shi'a groups unsuccessfully negotiated for more equitable, consequential political and social roles.\n\n===Ismailism===\n{{Further|Ismailism}}\nThe [[Ismaili]] Shiites accepted [[Ismail ibn Jafar]] instead of [[Musa al-Kadhim]] as the successor to Imam [[Jafar as-Sadiq]]. Ismaili communities in Afghanistan are less populous than the Twelver who consider the Ismaili heretical. They are found primarily in and near the eastern [[Hazarajat]], in the [[Baghlan]] area north of the [[Hindu Kush]], among the mountain Tajik of [[Badakhshan]], and amongst the [[Wakhi people|Wakhi]] in the [[Wakhan Corridor]].\n\nIsmaili are seen to follow their leaders uncritically. The pir or leader of Afghan Ismaili comes from the [[Sayed Kayan|Sayyid family of Kayan]], located near [[Doshi]], a small town at the northern foot of the [[Salang Pass]], in western [[Baghlan Province]]. During the 1980s Soviet war in Afghanistan this family acquired considerable political power. The [[Serena Hotel]] in Kabul is owned and operated by Ismailis.\n\n==Ahmadiyya==\n{{main|Ahmadiyya in Afghanistan}}\nThe [[Ahmadiyya]] is considered a movement that began in the late 19th century by [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] in [[Qadian]], [[India]]. It was seen as [[Apostasy in Islam|apostasy]] by all other Muslim groups, and accordingly only 12 years after Mirza Ghulam's claim of mahdi-hood, a couple of Ahmadiyya members were stoned to death in Kabul during 1901 to 1903. Later in the 1920s, King [[Amanullah Khan]] had several Ahmadiyya members forcibly reverted, and in 1924 affiliation with Ahmadiyya became a capital offense.<ref>Vincent Littrell. [Islam: Ahmadiyya]. World Association of International Studies, February 17, 2006</ref>\n\n==Sufis==\n{{Further|Sufism}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}\nThree Sufi orders are prominent: the [[Naqshbandiya]] founded in [[Bukhara]], the [[Qadiriya]] founded in [[Baghdad]], and the [[Cheshtiya]] located at Chesht-i-Sharif east of [[Herat]]. Among the [[Naqshbandi]], Ahmad al Faruqi Kabuli, born north of Kabul, acquired renown for his teachings in [[India]] during the reign of the [[Moghul]] Emperor [[Akbar]] in the sixteenth century. \n\nAnother famous [[Qadiriya]] pir named [[Mawlana Faizani]] came to prominence in the 1960s and 1970s, and was a leading critic against the creeping influence of communist philosophy. Jailed in the mid-70s, Mawlana Faizani disappeared when the [[khalq]]is came to power and remains missing to this day.\n\nThe [[Cheshtiya]] order was founded by Mawdid al-Cheshti who was born in the twelfth century and later taught in India. The Cheshtiya brotherhood, concentrated in the [[Hari River, Afghanistan|Hari River valley]] around [[Obe (Afghanistan)|Obe]], [[Karukh]] and Chehst-i-Sharif, is very strong locally and maintains madrasas with fine libraries. Traditionally the Cheshtiya have kept aloof from politics, although they were effectively active during the resistance within their own organizations and in their own areas.\n\nHerat and its environs has the largest number and greatest diversity of Sufi branches, many of which are connected with local tombs of pir (ziarat). Other Sufi groups are found all across the north, with important centers in [[Maimana]], [[Faryab Province]], and in [[Kunduz]]. The brotherhoods in Kabul and around Mazari Sharif are mostly associated with the Naqshbandiya. The Qadiriya are found mainly among the eastern [[Pushtun]] of [[Maidan Wardak Province|Wardak]], [[Paktia]] and [[Nangarhar]], including many [[Ghilzai]] nomadic groups. Other smaller groups are settled in [[Kandahar]] and in [[Shindand, Herat|Shindand]], [[Farah Province]]. The Cheshtiya are centered in the Hari River valley. There are no formal Sufi orders among the Shi'a in the central Hazarajat, although some of the concepts are associated with [[Sayyid]]s, descendants of Mohammad, who are especially venerated among the Shi'a.\n\nAfghanistan is unique in that there is little hostility between the [[Ulema|ulama]] (religion scholars) and the [[Sufi]] orders. A number of Sufi leaders are considered as ulama, and many ulama closely associate with Sufi brotherhoods. The general populace accords Sufis respect for their learning and for possessing karamat, the psychic spiritual power conferred upon them by God that enables pirs to perform acts of generosity and bestow blessings (barakat). Sufism therefore is an effective popular force. In addition, since Sufi leaders distance themselves from the mundane, they are at times turned to as more disinterested mediators in tribal disputes in preference to mullahs who are reputed to escalate minor secular issues into volatile confrontations couched in Islamic rhetoric.\n\nDespite the Afghan Sufis' stable position in Afghan society, Sufi leaders were among those executed following the [[Saur Revolution]], among them [[Baha'uddin Jan]], the ''pir naqshbandi'' of the [[Aym\u0101q|Aimaq]] of [[Purchaman District]], [[Farah Province|Farah]].<ref>Olivier Roy.

The father of [[Abu Hanifa]], Thabit bin Zuta, was born in the territory that is now Afghanistan. He emigrated to [[Kufa]] (in [[Iraq]]), where Hanifa was born. Later, the [[Samanids]] propagated [[Sunni Islam]] deep into Central Asia, and the first complete translation of the [[Qur'an]] into [[Persian language|Persian]] was made in the 9th century. Since then, Islam has dominated the country's religious landscape. Islamic leaders have entered the political sphere at various times of crisis but rarely exercised secular authority for long.\n\nThe remnants of a [[Kabul Shahi|Shahi]] presence in [[Peshawar]] were expelled by [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] in 998 and 1030.<ref>Afghanistan: a new history By Martin Ewans Edition: 2, illustrated Published by Routledge, 2002 Page 15 {{ISBN|0-415-29826-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-29826-1}}</ref> The [[Ghaznavids]] were replaced by the [[Ghurid Dynasty]] who expanded the already powerful Islamic empire. The [[Friday Mosque of Herat]] is one of the oldest mosques in the country, believed to have been first built under the Ghurids in the 12th century. During this period, known as the [[Islamic Golden Age]], Afghanistan became the second major center of learning in the [[Muslim world]] after [[Baghdad]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranchamber.com/history/ghaznavids/ghaznavids.php |title=\"Ghaznavid Dynasty\", History of Iran, Iran Chamber Society |publisher=Iranchamber.com |accessdate=14 November 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185258/http://iranchamber.com/history/ghaznavids/ghaznavids.php| archivedate= 24 November 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref name=\"JFS\">{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/text_761569370___42/Afghanistan.html |title=Afghanistan \u2013 John Ford Shroder, University of Nebraska |publisher=Webcitation.org |accessdate=19 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091031052339/http://encarta.msn.com/text_761569370___42/Afghanistan.html |archivedate=31 October 2009 }}</ref>\n\nAfter the Mongol invasion and destruction, the [[Timurids]] rebuilt the area and once again made it a center of Islamic learning. Shia Islam made its way to southern Afghanistan during the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid rule]] in the 16th century. Until [[Mir Wais Hotak]] liberated the Afghans in 1709, the [[Old Kandahar|Kandahar]] region of Afghanistan was often a battleground between the Shia Safavids and the Sunni [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]].\n\n===Conquest by Abdur Rahman Khan===\n[[File:Mosque in Kandahar-2011.jpg|thumb|left|The Friday Mosque in [[Kandahar]]. Adjacent to it is the [[Shrine of the Cloak]] and the tomb of [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]].]]\n\nThe first systematic employment of Islam as an instrument of state-building was initiated by King [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] (1880\u20131901) during his drive toward centralization. He decreed that all laws must comply with Islamic law and thus elevated the Shariah over customary laws embodied in the [[Pashtunwali]]. The [[ulama]] were enlisted to legitimize and sanction his state efforts as well as his central authority. This enhanced the religious community on the one hand, but as they were increasingly inducted into the bureaucracy as servants of the state, the religious leadership was ultimately weakened. Many economic privileges enjoyed by religious personalities and institutions were restructured within the framework of the state; the propagation of learning, once the sole prerogative of the ulama, was closely supervised; and the Amir became the supreme arbiter of justice.\n\n[[File:Men praying in Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|Men [[salat|praying]] at the [[Shrine of Ali|Blue Mosque]] (or Shrine of Ali) in the northern Afghan city of [[Mazar-i-Sharif]]]]\n\nAbdur Rahman Khan's successors continued and expanded his policies as they increased the momentum of secularization. Islam remained central to interactions, but the religious establishment remained essentially non-political, functioning as a moral rather than a political influence. Nevertheless, Islam asserted itself in times of national crisis. Moreover, when the religious leadership considered themselves severely threatened, charismatic religious personalities periodically employed Islam to rally disparate groups in opposition to the state. They rose up on several occasions against King [[Amanullah Shah]] (1919\u20131929), for example, in protest against reforms they believed to be western intrusions inimical to Islam.\n\nSubsequent rulers, mindful of traditional attitudes antithetical to secularization, were careful to underline the compatibility of Islam with modernization. Even so, and despite its pivotal position within the society, which continued to draw no distinction between religion and state, the role of religion in state affairs continued to decline.\n\n[[File:Lashkargah Mosque.jpg|thumb|A mosque in [[Lashkar Gah]], in the south of the country]]\n\nThe 1931 [[Constitution]] made [[Hanafi]] Shariah the state religion, while the 1964 Constitution simply prescribed that the state should conduct its religious ritual according to the Hanafi school. The 1977 Constitution declared Islam the religion of Afghanistan, but made no mention that the state ritual should be Hanafi. The [[Penal Code]] of 1976 and the [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil Code]] of 1977, covering the entire field of social justice, represent major attempts to cope with elements of secular law based on, but superseded by, other systems. Courts, for instance, were enjoined to consider cases first according to secular law, resorting to Shariah in areas secular law did not cover. By 1978, the government of the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA) openly expressed its aversion to the religious establishment. This precipitated the fledgling [[Islamist]] Movement into a national revolt; Islam moved from its passive stance on the periphery to play an active role.\n\n[[File:Kabul Mosque - usual traffic, August 3, 2010 - panoramio.jpg|thumb|[[Abdul Rahman Mosque]] in [[Kabul]], the largest mosque in Afghanistan]]\n\nPoliticized Islam in Afghanistan represents a break from Afghan traditions. The Islamist Movement originated in 1958 among faculties of [[Kabul University]], particularly in the Faculty of Islamic Law, which had been founded in 1952 with the stated purpose of raising the quality of religious teaching to accommodate modern science and technology. The founders <!--of the faculty, or of the Islamic Movement? --> were largely professors influenced by the [[Egypt|Egyptian]] [[Muslim Brotherhood]], a party formed in the 1930s that was dedicated to Islamic revivalism and social, economic, and political equity. Their <!--whose? the founders' or the Muslim Brotherhood's?--> objective is to come to terms with the modern world through the development of a political ideology based on Islam. The Afghan leaders, while indebted to many of these concepts, did not forge strong ties to similar movements in other countries.\n\nThe liberalization of government attitudes following the passage of the 1964 Constitution ushered in a period of intense activism among students at Kabul University. Professors and their students set up the Muslim Youth Organization (Sazmani Jawanani Musulman) in the mid-1960s at the same time that the leftists were also forming many parties. Initially [[communist]] students outnumbered the Muslim students, but by 1970 the Muslim Youth had gained a majority in student elections. Their membership was recruited from university faculties and from secondary schools in several cities such as [[Mazari Sharif]] and [[Herat]]. Some of these professors and students became the leaders of the [[Mujahideen]] rebels in the 1980s.\n\n===Radicalization and NATO presence===\n{{Further|Soviet\u2013Afghan War|War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)}}\nThe 1979 [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet invasion]] in support of a communist government triggered a major intervention of religion into Afghan political conflict, and Islam united the multiethnic political opposition. With the takeover of government by the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan|PDPA]] in April 1978, Islam had already become central to uniting the opposition against the communist ideology of the new rulers. As a politico-religious system, Islam is well-suited to the needs of a diverse, unorganized, often mutually antagonistic citizenry wishing to forge a united front against a common enemy, and war permitted various groups within the [[mujahideen]] to put into effect competing concepts of organization.\n\n[[File:Mujahideen prayer in Shultan Valley Kunar, 1987.jpg|thumb|[[Mujahideen]] praying in [[Kunar Province]] during the 1980s [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]]]]\n\nThe Soviet invasion and the [[Iranian Revolution]] not only led national uprisings but also the importation of foreign radical Muslims to Afghanistan. The mujahideen leaders were charismatic figures with dyadic ties to followers. In many cases military and political leaders replaced the tribal leadership; at times the religious leadership was strengthened; often the religious combined with the political leadership. Followers selected their local leaders on the basis of personal choice and precedence among regions, sects, ethnic groups or tribes, but the major leaders rose to prominence through their ties to outsiders who controlled the resources of money and arms.\n\nWith the support of foreign aid, the mujahideen were ultimately successful in their jihad to drive out the Soviet forces, but not in their attempts to construct a political alternative to govern Afghanistan after their victory. Throughout the war, the mujahideen were never fully able to replace traditional structures with a modern political system based on Islam. Most mujahideen commanders either used traditional patterns of power, becoming the new khans, or sought to adapt modern political structures to the traditional society. In time the prominent leaders accumulated wealth and power and, in contrast to the past, wealth became a determining factor in the delineation of power at all levels.\n\n[[File:Flickr - DVIDSHUB - International brothers, sisters in faith gather at Kandahar Air Field for Eid al-Adha (Image 1 of 10).jpg|thumb|Muslims praying together during an [[Eid al-Adha]] worship service at [[Kandahar International Airport|Kandahar Air Base]] in southern Afghanistan]]\n\nWith the departure of foreign troops and the long sought demise of Kabul's leftist government, The [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] finally came into being in April 1992. This represented a distinct break with Afghan history, for religious specialists had never before exercised state power. But the new government failed to establish its legitimacy and, as much of its financial support dissipated, local and middle range commanders and their militia not only fought among themselves but resorted to a host of unacceptable practices in their protracted scrambles for power and profit. Throughout the nation the populous suffered from harassment, extortion, kidnapping, burglary, hijacking and acts dishonoring women. [[Drug trafficking]] increased alarmingly; nowhere were the highways safe. The mujahideen had forfeited the trust they once enjoyed.\n\nIn the fall of 1994 a group called the [[Taliban]] came forth vowing to cleanse the nation of warlords and criminals. Their intention was to create a \"pure\" Islamic government subject to their own strict interpretations of the [[Shariah]]. Many [[Pakistan]]i politicians supported the Taliban, including [[Sami ul Haq]] who is regarded as the Father of the Taliban. A number of its leaders were one-time mujahideen members, but the bulk of their forces were young [[Afghan refugees]] trained in Pakistani [[madrassa]]s (religious schools), especially those run by the [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam|Jamiat-e Ulema-e Islam Pakistan]], the aggressively conservative Pakistani political religious party headed by [[Fazal-ur-Rehman (politician)|Maulana Fazlur Rahman]], arch rival of [[Qazi Hussain Ahmad]], leader of the equally conservative [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] and longtime supporter of the mujahideen.\n\nHeadquartered in [[Kandahar]], mostly [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]] from the rural areas, and from the top leadership down to the fighting militia characteristically in their thirties or forties and even younger, the Taliban swept the country. In September 1996 they captured Kabul and ruled over most of Afghanistan by 2001. The meteoric take over went almost unchallenged. Arms were collected and security was established. At the same time, acts committed for the purpose of enforcing the Shariah included public executions of murderers, [[stoning]] for adultery, amputation for theft, a ban on all forms of gambling such as [[kite flying]], [[chess]] and [[cockfighting|cockfights]], prohibition of music and videos, proscriptions against pictures of humans and animals, and an embargo on women's voices over the radio. Women were to remain as invisible as possible, behind the veil, in purdah in their homes, and dismissed from work or study outside their homes. They were toppled by a combined Afghan-NATO military force in late 2001. Majority of them escaped to neighboring Pakistan from where they launched [[Taliban insurgency|insurgency]] against the current NATO-backed Afghan government. Peace negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan government was ongoing as of 2013.\n\n==Islam in Afghan society==\nFor Afghans, Islam represents a potentially unifying symbolic system which offsets the divisiveness that frequently rises from the existence of a deep pride in tribal loyalties and an abounding sense of personal and family honor found in multitribal and multiethnic societies such as Afghanistan.\n\n[[File:Afghan men praying in Kunar-2009.jpg|thumb|250px|Afghans conducting their afternoon prayer in Kunar Province (December 2009)]]\n\nIslam is a central, pervasive influence throughout Afghan society; religious observances punctuate the rhythm of each day and season. In addition to a central [[congregational masjid]] for weekly communal prayers which are obligatory for men in Islam (but not for woman) and are generally well attended, smaller community-maintained mosques stand at the center of villages, as well as town and city neighborhoods. [[Masjid]]s serve not only as places of worship, but for a multitude of functions, including shelter for guests, places to meet, the focus of social religious festivities and schools. Almost every Afghan has at one time during his youth studied at a mosque school; for many this is the only formal education they receive.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nBecause Islam is a totalitarian way of life and functions as a comprehensive code of social behavior regulating all human relationships, individual and family status depends on the proper observance of the society's value system based on concepts defined in Islam. These are characterized by [[honesty]], frugality, [[generosity]], virtuousness, piousness, fairness, truthfulness, tolerance and respect for others. To uphold family honor, elders also control the behavior of their children according to these same Islamic prescriptions. At times, even competitive relations between tribal or ethnic groups are expressed in terms claiming religious superiority. In short, Islam structures day-to-day interactions of all members of the community.\n\n[[File:Men praying at Babur Gardens in 2010.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Men [[salat|praying]] inside the [[Bagh-e Babur|Gardens of Babur]] in Kabul]]\n\nThe religious establishment has several levels. Any Muslim can lead informal groups in prayer. [[Mullah]]s who officiate at mosques are normally appointed by the government after consultation with their communities and, although partially financed by the government, mullahs are largely dependent for their livelihood on community contributions including shelter and a portion of the harvest. Supposedly versed in the [[Qur'an]], [[Sunnah]], [[Hadith]] and [[Shariah]], they must ensure that their communities are knowledgeable in the fundamentals of Islamic ritual and behavior. This qualifies them to arbitrate disputes over religious interpretation. Often they function as paid teachers responsible for religious education classes held in mosques where children learn basic moral values and correct ritual practices. Their role has additional social aspects for they officiate on the occasion of life crisis rituals associated with births, marriages and deaths.\n\n[[File:Muslim men praying in Afghanistan-2010.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Politics of Afghanistan|Afghan politicians]] and foreign diplomats praying at the [[Embassy of the United States, Kabul|U.S. Embassy in Kabul]]]]\n\nBut rural mullahs are not part of an institutionalized hierarchy of clergy. Most are part-time mullahs working also as farmers or craftsmen. Some are barely literate, or only slightly more educated than the people they serve. Often, but by no means always, they are men of minimal wealth and, because they depend for their livelihood on the community that appoints them, they have little authority even within their own social boundaries. They are often treated with scant respect and are the butt of a vast body of jokes making fun of their arrogance and ignorance. Yet their role as religious arbiters forces them to take positions on issues that have political ramifications and since mullahs often disagree with one another, pitting one community against the other, they are frequently perceived as disruptive elements within their communities.\n\nVeneration of saints and shrines is opposed by some Islamic groups, particularly those ascribing to the [[Salafi]] or [[Ahle Hadith]]. Nevertheless, Afghanistan's landscape is liberally strewn with shrines honoring saints of all descriptions. Many of Afghanistan's oldest villages and towns grew up around shrines of considerable antiquity. Some are used as sanctuaries by fugitives.\n\nShrines vary in form from simple mounds of earth or stones marked by pennants to lavishly ornamented complexes surrounding a central domed tomb. These large establishments are controlled by prominent religious and secular leaders. Shrines may mark the final resting place of a fallen hero (shahid), a venerated religious teacher, a renowned Sufi poet, or relics, such as a hair of [[Muhammad]] or a piece of his cloak (khirqah). A great many commemorate legends about the miraculous exploits of [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]], the fourth [[caliph]] and the first Imam of Shi'a Islam believed to be buried at the nation's most elaborate shrine located in the heart of Mazari Sharif, the Exalted Shrine. Ali is revered throughout Afghanistan for his role as an intermediary in the face of tyranny.\n\nFestive annual fairs celebrated at shrines attract thousands of pilgrims and bring together all sections of communities. Pilgrims also visit shrines to seek the intercession of the saint for special favors, be it a cure for illness or the birth of a son. Women are particularly devoted to activities associated with shrines. These visits may be short or last several days and many pilgrims carry away specially blessed curative and protective [[amulets]] (usually a [[tawiz]]) to ward off the evil eye, assure loving relationships between husbands and wives and many other forms of solace. Like saint veneration, such practices are generally not encouraged in Islam according to classical understanding of the Holy Qu'ran and Hadiths (prophetic sayings of the Rabi)\n\n==Shia Islam in Afghanistan==\n{{Main|Shia Islam in Afghanistan}}\n[[File:Blue mosaic, Kabul.jpg|thumb|[[Abu Fazl Mosque]] in [[Kabul]] during construction in 2008, the largest [[Shia Islam in Afghanistan|Shia]] mosque in Afghanistan<ref>[https://www.flickr.com/photos/51400588@N06/4726044458/in/photostream/]</ref>]]\n\nRoughly 15% of the [[Demographics of Afghanistan#Population statistics|Afghan population]] practice [[Shia Islam in Afghanistan|Shia Islam]].<ref name=\"Pew\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/08/09/the-worlds-muslims-unity-and-diversity-1-religious-affiliation/#identity|title=Chapter 1: Religious Affiliation|date=August 9, 2012|work=The World\u2019s Muslims: Unity and Diversity|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]'s Religion & Public Life Project|accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Factbook\">{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/af.html |title=People and Society:: Afghanistan |publisher=www.cia.gov |work=[[The World Factbook]] |accessdate=2017-05-22}}</ref> Most Shias in Afghanistan belong to the [[Twelver]] branch. This includes the [[Hazara people|Hazara]] ethnic group and the smaller urbanized [[Qizilbash]] group, who are originally from eastern Iran.\n\nPolitically aware Shia students formed the hardcore of the Afghan [[Maoist]] movement in the 1960s and early 1970s. After the [[Saur Revolution]] (April Revolution) of 1978 and the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979, Shia rebel groups in the [[Hazarajat]] region, although frequently at odds with one another, became active in [[mujahideen]] activities. They were aided by Shi'a Iran and fought against the Soviet-backed Afghan government as well as other mujahideen groups.\n\nDuring the political maneuvering leading up to the establishment of the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] in 1992, the Shi'a groups unsuccessfully negotiated for more equitable, consequential political and social roles.\n\n===Ismailism===\n{{Further|Ismailism}}\nThe [[Ismaili]] Shiites accepted [[Ismail ibn Jafar]] instead of [[Musa al-Kadhim]] as the successor to Imam [[Jafar as-Sadiq]]. Ismaili communities in Afghanistan are less populous than the Twelver who consider the Ismaili heretical. They are found primarily in and near the eastern [[Hazarajat]], in the [[Baghlan]] area north of the [[Hindu Kush]], among the mountain Tajik of [[Badakhshan]], and amongst the [[Wakhi people|Wakhi]] in the [[Wakhan Corridor]].\n\nIsmaili are seen to follow their leaders uncritically. The pir or leader of Afghan Ismaili comes from the [[Sayed Kayan|Sayyid family of Kayan]], located near [[Doshi]], a small town at the northern foot of the [[Salang Pass]], in western [[Baghlan Province]]. During the 1980s Soviet war in Afghanistan this family acquired considerable political power. The [[Serena Hotel]] in Kabul is owned and operated by Ismailis.\n\n==Ahmadiyya==\n{{main|Ahmadiyya in Afghanistan}}\nThe [[Ahmadiyya]] is considered a movement that began in the late 19th century by [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] in [[Qadian]], [[India]]. It was seen as [[Apostasy in Islam|apostasy]] by all other Muslim groups, and accordingly only 12 years after Mirza Ghulam's claim of mahdi-hood, a couple of Ahmadiyya members were stoned to death in Kabul during 1901 to 1903. Later in the 1920s, King [[Amanullah Khan]] had several Ahmadiyya members forcibly reverted, and in 1924 affiliation with Ahmadiyya became a capital offense.<ref>Vincent Littrell. [Islam: Ahmadiyya]. World Association of International Studies, February 17, 2006</ref>\n\n==Sufis==\n{{Further|Sufism}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}\nThree Sufi orders are prominent: the [[Naqshbandiya]] founded in [[Bukhara]], the [[Qadiriya]] founded in [[Baghdad]], and the [[Cheshtiya]] located at Chesht-i-Sharif east of [[Herat]]. Among the [[Naqshbandi]], Ahmad al Faruqi Kabuli, born north of Kabul, acquired renown for his teachings in [[India]] during the reign of the [[Moghul]] Emperor [[Akbar]] in the sixteenth century. \n\nAnother famous [[Qadiriya]] pir named [[Mawlana Faizani]] came to prominence in the 1960s and 1970s, and was a leading critic against the creeping influence of communist philosophy. Jailed in the mid-70s, Mawlana Faizani disappeared when the [[khalq]]is came to power and remains missing to this day.\n\nThe [[Cheshtiya]] order was founded by Mawdid al-Cheshti who was born in the twelfth century and later taught in India. The Cheshtiya brotherhood, concentrated in the [[Hari River, Afghanistan|Hari River valley]] around [[Obe (Afghanistan)|Obe]], [[Karukh]] and Chehst-i-Sharif, is very strong locally and maintains madrasas with fine libraries. Traditionally the Cheshtiya have kept aloof from politics, although they were effectively active during the resistance within their own organizations and in their own areas.\n\nHerat and its environs has the largest number and greatest diversity of Sufi branches, many of which are connected with local tombs of pir (ziarat). Other Sufi groups are found all across the north, with important centers in [[Maimana]], [[Faryab Province]], and in [[Kunduz]]. The brotherhoods in Kabul and around Mazari Sharif are mostly associated with the Naqshbandiya. The Qadiriya are found mainly among the eastern [[Pushtun]] of [[Maidan Wardak Province|Wardak]], [[Paktia]] and [[Nangarhar]], including many [[Ghilzai]] nomadic groups. Other smaller groups are settled in [[Kandahar]] and in [[Shindand, Herat|Shindand]], [[Farah Province]]. The Cheshtiya are centered in the Hari River valley. There are no formal Sufi orders among the Shi'a in the central Hazarajat, although some of the concepts are associated with [[Sayyid]]s, descendants of Mohammad, who are especially venerated among the Shi'a.\n\nAfghanistan is unique in that there is little hostility between the [[Ulema|ulama]] (religion scholars) and the [[Sufi]] orders. A number of Sufi leaders are considered as ulama, and many ulama closely associate with Sufi brotherhoods. The general populace accords Sufis respect for their learning and for possessing karamat, the psychic spiritual power conferred upon them by God that enables pirs to perform acts of generosity and bestow blessings (barakat). Sufism therefore is an effective popular force. In addition, since Sufi leaders distance themselves from the mundane, they are at times turned to as more disinterested mediators in tribal disputes in preference to mullahs who are reputed to escalate minor secular issues into volatile confrontations couched in Islamic rhetoric.\n\nDespite the Afghan Sufis' stable position in Afghan society, Sufi leaders were among those executed following the [[Saur Revolution]], among them [[Baha'uddin Jan]], the ''pir naqshbandi'' of the [[Aym\u0101q|Aimaq]] of [[Purchaman District]], [[Farah Province|Farah]].<ref>Olivier Roy.

While there, he became known for his brand of sarcasm, and his characters in a number of [[Sketch comedy|sketches]] were hits. Some of them include a [[flight attendant]] for \"[[Total Bastard Airlines]]\" who bids a dismissive \"Buh-Bye\" to each passenger upon disembarking; a receptionist for [[Dick Clark]] who, as a matter of policy, asks people indiscriminately, \"And you are?\"; and the sarcastic \"[[Hollywood Minute]]\" reporter who puts celebrities down by means of [[one-liner joke|one-liners]].  Other characters include Christy Henderson from the [[Gap Girls]] and Karl from the Karl's Video sketches. He also did impressions of various celebrities, including [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Michael J. Fox]]. According to interviews with Spade, most of the material that he wrote early in his time at SNL was given to [[Dana Carvey]] to perform on the show.\n\nOn December 9, 1995, Spade revived \"Hollywood Minute\" inside a segment called \"Spade in America\"; Spade joked, \"Look, children, it's a falling star.

He starred with fellow ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' cast member [[Chris Farley]] in two [[buddy comedy]] films, ''[[Tommy Boy]]'' (1995) and ''[[Black Sheep (1996 film)|Black Sheep]]'' (1996). The two were planning a third film together when Farley died of a drug overdose in 1997 at the age of 33. When Spade declined to attend Farley's funeral, rumors abounded that there had been a falling out between the two. Spade stated that their friendship had been under some tension, partly because of Farley's drug problem, but that he did not attend the funeral simply because he could not handle it emotionally.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Grow|first1=Kory|title=David Spade Explains Why He Didn't Attend Chris Farley's Funeral|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/david-spade-explains-why-he-didnt-attend-chris-farleys-funeral-20140430|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=24 February 2018|date=April 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAlthough he received several offers to star in his own TV shows, he turned them down and joined the ensemble cast of [[Steven Levitan]]'s office sitcom ''[[Just Shoot Me!]],'' opposite [[Laura San Giacomo]] and [[George Segal]], which ran for seven seasons from 1997 to 2003. He played a sarcastic receptionist, [[Dennis Finch]].\n\nIn 2000, Spade provided the voice of Kuzco in Disney's [[buddy comedy]] film, ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'' (2000) and would later reprise the role in its direct-to-video sequel ''[[Kronk's New Groove]]'' (2005).\n\nWhile appearing on ''Just Shoot Me'', Spade had his first solo starring role as the title character in the 2001 film ''[[Joe Dirt]]'', which was a modest box office success. The film was co-written by Spade and Fred Wolf.\n\nSpade starred again in the 2003 film ''[[Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star]]'', again co-written by Spade and Wolf. It was the first of many films in which Spade has appeared that were produced by another ''Saturday Night Live'' castmate, [[Adam Sandler]]. Most notable among these are the films ''[[Grown Ups (film)|Grown Ups]]'' (2010) and ''[[Grown Ups 2]]'' (2013), both of which included Spade and Sandler among the lead roles, and both of which were major box office hits.\n\nSpade hosted both the [[Teen Choice Awards]] and [[SpikeTV]]'s [[Spike Video Game Awards|Video Game Awards]] in 2003. He voiced characters on several episodes of ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'' and produced his own TV series ''[[Sammy (TV series)|Sammy]]'' in 2000. From 2002 to 2006, Spade regularly appeared in commercials for [[Capital One]] (with [[Nate Torrence]]) where he played the employee of a fictional rival company whose policy toward honoring credit card rewards (and just about everything else) is \"always no.\" In 2004, he joined the cast of ''[[8 Simple Rules]],'' following the death of the sitcom's star, [[John Ritter]], for the show's third and final season.\n\nHe hosted the Comedy Central TV show ''[[The Showbiz Show with David Spade]]'' for three seasons, from September 2005 to October 2007.

While there, he became known for his brand of sarcasm, and his characters in a number of [[Sketch comedy|sketches]] were hits. Some of them include a [[flight attendant]] for \"[[Total Bastard Airlines]]\" who bids a dismissive \"Buh-Bye\" to each passenger upon disembarking; a receptionist for [[Dick Clark]] who, as a matter of policy, asks people indiscriminately, \"And you are?\"; and the sarcastic \"[[Hollywood Minute]]\" reporter who puts celebrities down by means of [[one-liner joke|one-liners]].  Other characters include Christy Henderson from the [[Gap Girls]] and Karl from the Karl's Video sketches. He also did impressions of various celebrities, including [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Michael J. Fox]]. According to interviews with Spade, most of the material that he wrote early in his time at SNL was given to [[Dana Carvey]] to perform on the show.\n\nOn December 9, 1995, Spade revived \"Hollywood Minute\" inside a segment called \"Spade in America\"; Spade joked, \"Look, children, it's a falling star.

He starred with fellow ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' cast member [[Chris Farley]] in two [[buddy comedy]] films, ''[[Tommy Boy]]'' (1995) and ''[[Black Sheep (1996 film)|Black Sheep]]'' (1996). The two were planning a third film together when Farley died of a drug overdose in 1997 at the age of 33. When Spade declined to attend Farley's funeral, rumors abounded that there had been a falling out between the two. Spade stated that their friendship had been under some tension, partly because of Farley's drug problem, but that he did not attend the funeral simply because he could not handle it emotionally.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Grow|first1=Kory|title=David Spade Explains Why He Didn't Attend Chris Farley's Funeral|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/david-spade-explains-why-he-didnt-attend-chris-farleys-funeral-20140430|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=24 February 2018|date=April 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAlthough he received several offers to star in his own TV shows, he turned them down and joined the ensemble cast of [[Steven Levitan]]'s office sitcom ''[[Just Shoot Me!]],'' opposite [[Laura San Giacomo]] and [[George Segal]], which ran for seven seasons from 1997 to 2003. He played a sarcastic receptionist, [[Dennis Finch]].\n\nIn 2000, Spade provided the voice of Kuzco in Disney's [[buddy comedy]] film, ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'' (2000) and would later reprise the role in its direct-to-video sequel ''[[Kronk's New Groove]]'' (2005).\n\nWhile appearing on ''Just Shoot Me'', Spade had his first solo starring role as the title character in the 2001 film ''[[Joe Dirt]]'', which was a modest box office success. The film was co-written by Spade and Fred Wolf.\n\nSpade starred again in the 2003 film ''[[Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star]]'', again co-written by Spade and Wolf. It was the first of many films in which Spade has appeared that were produced by another ''Saturday Night Live'' castmate, [[Adam Sandler]]. Most notable among these are the films ''[[Grown Ups (film)|Grown Ups]]'' (2010) and ''[[Grown Ups 2]]'' (2013), both of which included Spade and Sandler among the lead roles, and both of which were major box office hits.\n\nSpade hosted both the [[Teen Choice Awards]] and [[SpikeTV]]'s [[Spike Video Game Awards|Video Game Awards]] in 2003. He voiced characters on several episodes of ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'' and produced his own TV series ''[[Sammy (TV series)|Sammy]]'' in 2000. From 2002 to 2006, Spade regularly appeared in commercials for [[Capital One]] (with [[Nate Torrence]]) where he played the employee of a fictional rival company whose policy toward honoring credit card rewards (and just about everything else) is \"always no.\" In 2004, he joined the cast of ''[[8 Simple Rules]],'' following the death of the sitcom's star, [[John Ritter]], for the show's third and final season.\n\nHe hosted the Comedy Central TV show ''[[The Showbiz Show with David Spade]]'' for three seasons, from September 2005 to October 2007.

Baba's father, Charudutt Sharma who is a boring Cashew nut dealer for everyone, reveals to a shocked Baba on his 25th birthday that actually they are a family of hit men since the past 12 generations, and now Baba has to take over as the 13th. On the other hand, Baba's love interest Angelina runs a Beach Cafe. Her father Brian Morris is a retired art teacher, but fuels his greed for money and excitement, by selling fakes of an old Renoir painting that his family has inherited. With Baba and Angelina, both keeping their respective secrets, problems start when Kamya, an art gallery owner, wants the original Renoir and blackmails the Home Minister, Utpal Shivalkar for it.
