In addition it has 6 smaller arches, higher up in a second row, presumably to help the flow during flooding of the river. The main arch is the only one which has a permanent flow of water.<ref name=Petersen186/>\nThe bridge has [[voussoirs]] throughout its [[Vault (architecture)|vault]], differing from well known Mamluk bridges such as the [[Daughters of Jacob Bridge]], [[Yibna Bridge]] and [[Jisr Jindas]], which use small stones in the vault of their arches.<ref name=Petersen296/>\n\n==History==\n===Roman period===\nThe bridge shows at least two major phases of construction; a possibly Roman-origin lower level and the upper pointed arches likely from the medieval period.<ref name=Petersen296/> Some sources state that the bridge was built in Roman times, and others that it was built in the Middle Ages. A 1925 letter written by the Palestine Department of Antiquities wrote that the bridge was first built in Roman times.<ref name=Petersen186/> This is supported by a Roman [[milestone]] discovered nearby, which given the scarcity of other local structures makes it likely that a Roman river crossing existed at the point.<ref name=Petersen186/>\n\n===Middle ages===\n[[Al-Muqaddasi]] (c. 945/946 - 991),  described \"beyond the lower end of the [[Sea of Galilee|Lake of Tiberias]] is a great bridge, over which lies the road to [[Damascus]]\",<ref>Mukaddasi, 1886, p.

The main arch is the only one which has a permanent flow of water.<ref name=Petersen186/>\nThe bridge has [[voussoirs]] throughout its [[Vault (architecture)|vault]], differing from well known Mamluk bridges such as the [[Daughters of Jacob Bridge]], [[Yibna Bridge]] and [[Jisr Jindas]], which use small stones in the vault of their arches.<ref name=Petersen296/>\n\n==History==\n===Roman period===\nThe bridge shows at least two major phases of construction; a possibly Roman-origin lower level and the upper pointed arches likely from the medieval period.<ref name=Petersen296/> Some sources state that the bridge was built in Roman times, and others that it was built in the middle ages. A 1925 letter written by the Palestine Department of Antiquities wrote that the bridge was first built in Roman times.<ref name=Petersen186/> This is supported by a Roman [[milestone]] discovered nearby, which given the scarcity of other local structures makes it likely that a Roman river crossing existed at the point.<ref name=Petersen186/>\n\n===Middle ages===\n[[Al-Muqaddasi]] (c. 945/946 - 991),  described \"beyond the lower end of the [[Sea of Galilee|Lake of Tiberias]] is a great bridge, over which lies the road to [[Damascus]]\",<ref>Mukaddasi, 1886, p.

She taught herself photography to document her artistic endeavors, and experimenting with themes of repetition.  She also become interested in advertising and high technology--trying to marry the commercial look with a noncommercial purpose, combining the technical focus found in the commercial world and bringing that into the fine art studio.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tarlow|first=Lois|date=|title=Sandy Skoglund|url=|journal=Art New England|volume=19|pages=25|via=Art & Architecture Source}}</ref> Skoglund created repetitive, process-oriented art  through the techniques of mark-making and photocopying.

Skoglund's works are quirky and idiosyncratic, and as former photography critic for [[The New York Times]] [[Andy Grundberg]] describes, they \"evoke adult fears in a playful, childlike context\".\n\nOne of her most-known works, entitled ''Radioactive Cats'', features green-painted clay cats running amok in a gray kitchen. An older man sits in a chair with his back facing the camera while his elderly wife looks into a refrigerator that is the same color as the walls. \"The artist sculpted the life-size cats herself using chicken wire and plaster, and painted them bright green.

It had good communications, being served by the [[Fosse Way]], which runs north\u2013south half a mile from the site and led originally from the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] settlements of [[Cirencester]] to [[Leicester]]. The [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 lists Compton as two manors, the largest of which was among the many holdings of [[Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester]] (c. 1049 \u2013 1118), Count of Meulan, one of the few proven [[companions of William the Conqueror]] who fought at the  [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066.

It had good communications, being served by the [[Fosse Way]], which runs north\u2013south half a mile from the site and led originally from the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] settlements of [[Cirencester]] to [[Leicester]]. The [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 lists Compton as two manors, the largest of which was among the many holdings of [[Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester]] (c.1049-1118), Count of Meulan, one of the few proven [[companions of William the Conqueror]] who fought at the  [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066. It descended to his younger brother [[Henry de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Warwick]] (d.1119) (\"Henry de Newburgh\") who granted the church as a [[prebend]] to support one canon of the [[Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick]].<ref>Dugdale</ref> The donation was confirmed by [[Walter Durdent]] [[Bishop of Coventry]] from 1149 to 1159 and again twice by [[Guy de Beauchamp, 10th Earl of Warwick]] (c.1272-1315), in 1291 and 1310.<ref>Dugdale</ref>\n\nThe village was demolished before the time of the historian [[John Rous (historian)|John Rous]] (c.1411/20-1492) (a canon of the [[Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick]]), as [[William Dugdale]] notes in his [[Antiquities of Warwickshire]] (1656):<ref>https://archive.org/details/antiquitiesofwar00dugd/page/436/mode/2up</ref><br/>\n:''When this town was depopulated I cannot directly affirm but it seems to have been antiently for I find that our countreyman Rous hath it in the list of those whereof he so much complains''. \n\n===Murdac===\nAt some time before 1150 the manor was granted to [[Robert Murdac]] when it became known as ''Compton Murdak'', and was inherited by his descendants and thence to the heirs of the Murdak family. In 1370, after two hundred years of ownership by his family, Sir [[Thomas Murdak]] surrendered the estate to [[Alice Perrers]], mistress of King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]].\n\n===Verney===\nIn about 1441<ref>[[William Dugdale|Dugdale, Sir William]], ''Antiquities of Warwickshire'', London, 1656, pp.435, ''Compton Murdak''[https://archive.org/details/antiquitiesofwar00dugd/page/434/mode/2up]</ref> it was acquired by [[Richard Verney]] (d.1489) with the assistance of his younger brother [[John Verney (priest)|John Verney]], [[Dean of Lichfield]], formerly Rector of [[Bredon]] in Worcestershire, and supervisor and receiver-general to [[Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick]] (1382-1439).<ref>Dugdale, p.435</ref> The Verney family had begun acquiring lands in the area surrounding Compton Murdak in the 1430s before purchasing the estate.

His son [[George Verney, 12th Baron Willoughby de Broke]] (1659\u20131728) rebuilt the house and landscaped the gardens in the early 18th century.

Conscripted in 1939 and discharged in October 1940, Mammeri registered at the Facult\u00e9 des Lettres d\u2019[[Algiers|Alger]].

He taught in [[M\u00e9d\u00e9a]], and then in [[Ben Aknoun]], and published his first novel, ''The Forgotten Hill ''in 1952. He was forced to leave Algiers in 1957 because of the [[Algerian War]]. Mammeri came back to Algeria shortly after its independence in 1962. \n\nFrom 1965 to 1972 he taught [[Berber languages|Berber]] at the university in the department of [[ethnology]]; although teaching Berber was prohibited in 1962 by the Algerian government, he was permitted to teach Berber courses until 1973, when courses such as ethnology and [[anthropology]] were judged as \"colonial sciences\" and disbanded. In 1969 Mammeri collected and published texts of the [[Berbers|Berber]] poet [[Si Mohand]]. In 1972, he published the grammar of Tamazight in Tamazight, a book in which he used a Latin-based alphabet and defined the orthographic rules for this language. These became the standard for writing in Tamazight today.<ref>Taje\u1e5b\u1e5bumt n tmazi\u0263t.

He also headed the first national union of Algerian writers for a time, until he left due to disagreements over views of the role of writers in society. In 1980, the prohibition of one of his conferences at [[Tizi Ouzou]] on kabyle poetry caused riots and what would be called the [[Berber Spring]] in [[Kabylie]].<ref>{{Google books|of6q6v5Lv7cC|Berber Culture On The World Stage: From Village To Video By Jane E.

Thus he was able to compile a wealth of information on the Berber language and literature. In 1988 he received an honorary doctorate from [[Sorbonne]].\n\nMammeri died the evening of February 26, 1989 in a car accident, which took place near [[Ain-Defla]] on his return from a symposium in [[Oujda]] (Morocco).

Miami was also able to schedule 10 games against [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] opponents that would take place throughout the season.\n\nAfter an initial win over [[Cincinnati Bearcats|Cincinnati]], Miami was beaten soundly in four consecutive games. The losses were against the top-tier squads which was a trend that would continue throughout the season. Miami finished the regular season with a very good 12\u20133\u20131 record in conference, but lost all 10 games against the D-I teams. Miami's up and down year came to an end with the MCCHA tournament, with the entire championship being played in it's home arena. The Redskins took advantage of the opportunity and routed [[Eastern Michigan Eagles|Eastern Michigan]] before shutting out Michigan\u2013Dearborn to claim the championship.<ref name = results>{{cite

Three previous judges of the award, [[Malcolm Bradbury]], David Holloway and W. L. Webb, met and chose [[Salman Rushdie]]'s ''[[Midnight's Children]]'', the 1981 winner, as \"the best novel out of all the winners\".<ref>{{cite news|first=John|last=Mullan|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jul/12/saturdayreviewsfeatres.guardianreview31|title=Lives & letters, Where are they now?|work=The Guardian|publisher=|date=12 July 2008|accessdate=11 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the Man Booker Prize set up a \"Best of Beryl\" prize, for the author [[Beryl Bainbridge]], who had been nominated five times and yet failed to win once. The prize is said to count as a Booker Prize. The nominees were ''[[An Awfully Big Adventure (novel)|An Awfully Big Adventure]]'', ''[[Every Man for Himself (novel)|Every Man for Himself]]'', ''[[The Bottle Factory Outing]]'', ''[[The Dressmaker (Bainbridge novel)|The Dressmaker]]'' and ''[[Master Georgie]]'', which won.\n\nSimilarly, [[The Best of the Booker]] was awarded in 2008 to celebrate the prize's 40th anniversary. A shortlist of six winners was chosen and the decision was left to a public vote; the winner was again ''Midnight's Children''.<ref>{{cite news|first=Michelle| last=Pauli|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,,2258500,00.html|title=Best of the Booker|work=The Guardian|publisher=|date=21 February 2008|accessdate=3 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7499495.stm|title=Rushdie wins Best of Booker prize|work=BBC News|date=10 July 2008|accessdate=3 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, to celebrate the 50th anniversary, the Golden Man Booker was awarded. One book from each decade was selected by a panel of judges: Naipaul's ''[[In a Free State]]'' (the 1971 winner), Lively's ''[[Moon Tiger]]'' (1987), Ondaatje's ''[[The English Patient]]'' (1992), Mantel's ''[[Wolf Hall]]'' and Saunders' ''[[Lincoln in the Bardo]]''.

Non-longlisted publishers can submit one title, publishers with one or two longlisted books in the previous five years can submit two, publishers with three or four longlisted books are allowed three submissions, and publishers with five or more longlisted books can have four submissions.\n\nIn addition, previous winners of the prize are automatically considered if they enter new titles. Books may also be called in: publishers can make written representations to the judges to consider titles in addition to those already entered. In the 21st century the average number of books considered by the judges has been approximately 130.<ref>{{cite web |first=Philip|last= Jones|author2= Joshua Farrington|title=Man Booker Prize reveals criteria changes |work=[[The Bookseller]] |url=https://www.thebookseller.com/news/man-booker-prize-reveals-criteria-changes |website=|date=18 September 2013}}</ref><ref name=Gompertz />\n\n==Related awards==\nA separate prize for which any living writer in the world may qualify, the [[Man Booker International Prize]] was inaugurated in 2005. Until 2015, it was given every two years to a living author of any nationality for a body of work published in English or generally available in English translation. In 2016, the award was significantly reconfigured, and is now given annually to a single book in English translation, with a \u00a350,000 prize for the winning title, shared equally between author and translator.\n\nA Russian version of the Booker Prize was created in 1992 called the [[Booker-Open Russia Literary Prize]], also known as the Russian Booker Prize. In 2007, Man Group plc established the [[Man Asian Literary Prize]], an annual literary award given to the best novel by an Asian writer, either written in English or translated into English, and published in the previous calendar year.\n\nAs part of ''[[The Times]]''' [[Cheltenham Literature Festival|Literature Festival]] in [[Cheltenham]], a Booker event is held on the last Saturday of the festival. Four guest speakers/judges debate a shortlist of four books from a given year from before the introduction of the Booker prize, and a winner is chosen. Unlike the real Man Booker (1969 through 2014), writers from outside the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] are also considered. In 2008, the winner for 1948 was [[Alan Paton]]'s ''[[Cry, the Beloved Country]]'', beating [[Norman Mailer]]'s ''[[The Naked and the Dead]]'', [[Graham Greene]]'s ''[[The Heart of the Matter]]'' and [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s ''[[The Loved One]]''. In 2015, the winner for 1915 was [[Ford Madox Ford]]'s ''[[The Good Soldier]]'', beating ''[[The Thirty-Nine Steps]]'' ([[John Buchan]]), ''[[Of Human Bondage]]'' ([[W. Somerset Maugham]]), ''[[Psmith, Journalist]]'' ([[P. G. Wodehouse]]) and ''[[The Voyage Out]]'' ([[Virginia Woolf]]).<ref>Haslam, Sara (13 October 2015), [http://www.fordmadoxfordsociety.org/blog/fords-the-good-soldier-wins-the-cheltenham-booker-1915-at-2015-festival \"Ford's The Good Soldier Wins The Cheltenham Booker 1915 at 2015 Festival\"].

Three previous judges of the award, [[Malcolm Bradbury]], David Holloway and W. L.

The prize is said to count as a Booker Prize. The nominees were ''[[An Awfully Big Adventure (novel)|An Awfully Big Adventure]]'', ''[[Every Man for Himself (novel)|Every Man for Himself]]'', ''[[The Bottle Factory Outing]]'', ''[[The Dressmaker (Bainbridge novel)|The Dressmaker]]'' and ''[[Master Georgie]]'', which won.\n\nSimilarly, [[The Best of the Booker]] was awarded in 2008 to celebrate the prize's 40th anniversary. A shortlist of six winners was chosen and the decision was left to a public vote; the winner was again ''Midnight's Children''.<ref>{{cite news|first=Michelle| last=Pauli|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,,2258500,00.html|title=Best of the Booker|work=The Guardian|publisher=|date=21 February 2008|accessdate=3 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7499495.stm|title=Rushdie wins Best of Booker prize|work=BBC News|date=10 July 2008|accessdate=3 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, to celebrate the 50th anniversary, the Golden Man Booker was awarded.

Non-longlisted publishers can submit one title, publishers with one or two longlisted books in the previous five years can submit two, publishers with three or four longlisted books are allowed three submissions, and publishers with five or more longlisted books can have four submissions.\n\nIn addition, previous winners of the prize are automatically considered if they enter new titles. Books may also be called in: publishers can make written representations to the judges to consider titles in addition to those already entered. In the 21st century the average number of books considered by the judges has been approximately 130.<ref>{{cite web |first=Philip|last= Jones|author2= Joshua Farrington|title=Man Booker Prize reveals criteria changes |work=[[The Bookseller]] |url=https://www.thebookseller.com/news/man-booker-prize-reveals-criteria-changes |website=|date=18 September 2013}}</ref><ref name=Gompertz />\n\n==Related awards==\nA separate prize for which any living writer in the world may qualify, the [[Man Booker International Prize]] was inaugurated in 2005. Until 2015, it was given every two years to a living author of any nationality for a body of work published in English or generally available in English translation. In 2016, the award was significantly reconfigured, and is now given annually to a single book in English translation, with a \u00a350,000 prize for the winning title, shared equally between author and translator.\n\nA Russian version of the Booker Prize was created in 1992 called the [[Booker-Open Russia Literary Prize]], also known as the Russian Booker Prize. In 2007, Man Group plc established the [[Man Asian Literary Prize]], an annual literary award given to the best novel by an Asian writer, either written in English or translated into English, and published in the previous calendar year.\n\nAs part of ''[[The Times]]''' [[Cheltenham Literature Festival|Literature Festival]] in [[Cheltenham]], a Booker event is held on the last Saturday of the festival. Four guest speakers/judges debate a shortlist of four books from a given year from before the introduction of the Booker prize, and a winner is chosen. Unlike the real Man Booker (1969 through 2014), writers from outside the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] are also considered. In 2008, the winner for 1948 was [[Alan Paton]]'s ''[[Cry, the Beloved Country]]'', beating [[Norman Mailer]]'s ''[[The Naked and the Dead]]'', [[Graham Greene]]'s ''[[The Heart of the Matter]]'' and [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s ''[[The Loved One]]''. In 2015, the winner for 1915 was [[Ford Madox Ford]]'s ''[[The Good Soldier]]'', beating ''[[The Thirty-Nine Steps]]'' ([[John Buchan]]), ''[[Of Human Bondage]]'' ([[W. Somerset Maugham]]), ''[[Psmith, Journalist]]'' ([[P. G.
