Ranatunga attended [[St. Sylvester's College]], [[Kandy]]; where he excelled at many sports, captained hockey and athletic teams. He was the head prefect and won the Gold Medal for the best all round student in 1949.\n\n== Military career ==\nJoining the [[Ceylon Army]] in 1950 and received his officer training at [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]], where his company commander was [[Patrick Anthony Porteous]]. After completing his training at Sandhurst, he was sent to [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] of additional training at the [[British Army Jungle Warfare Training School|British Army Jungle Warfare School]]. On his return he was commissioned as a [[Second Lieutenant]] in the [[Ceylon Light Infantry]]. Later he was transferred to the 1st Reconnaissance (Recce) Regiment at its formation as the 1st Reconnaissance Squadron in 1955 which grew into the [[Sri Lanka Armoured Corps|Ceylon Armoured Corps]]. His squadron was deployed in 1956 to [[Ampara]] to subdue to the [[1956 Ceylonese riots|Gal Oya riots]] and thereafter to [[Trincomalee]] to control civil unrest. He underwent training at [[Bovington Camp|British Army Armoured Center, Bovington]] in 1957 as the regimental signals officer of the 1 Recce Regiment. In 1958, he served as a military observer in [[Lebanon]] United Nations Observation Group during the [[1958 Lebanon crisis|Lebanon crisis]]. Rejoining his regiment on his return to Ceylon. \n\nIn 1962, he attended the [[Staff College, Camberley]], where he became friends with Major [[Yakubu Gowon]], later General and [[Supreme Military Council of Nigeria (1966\u20131979)|Head of the Federal Military Government of Nigeria]]. On his return he was appointed as second-in-command of the 1 Recce Regiment. He was thereafter transferred to [[Army Headquarters (Sri Lanka)|Army Headquarters]] as the [[General Staff Officer|general staff officer]] - operations before returning to the 1st Recce Regiment as its [[commanding officer]]. \n\n===Insurrection===\nHe was a [[Lieutenant Colonel]] and commanding officer of the 1st Recce Regiment when the [[1971 Insurrection]] started and he was appointed the [[Military Coordinating Officer]] of the [[Kegalle District]] by the Prime Minister, where he effectively subdued the insurgency in the district which had been over run by insurgents. He was deployed with the 1st Reconnaissance Regiment and a company of the Ceylon Light Infantry. Following the clearing of insurgents from Kegalle, he was appointed as Military Coordinating Officer of the [[Anuradhapura District]] to lead mop-up operations. He was instrumental in the establishment of the [[Saliyapura Army Camp|Anuradhapura Army Base]] as a permanent military complex.  \n\n===Higher command===\nHe was nominated to attended the [[Royal College of Defence Studies]] in 1973. On his return he was appointed Commander, Northern Command in [[Anuradhapura]] and thereafter Commander, South East Command at the [[Diyatalawa Garrison]] in February 1975 and in March 1976 he was appointed Commandant of the [[Sri Lanka Military Academy|Army Training Centre]]. In January 1977, he was appointed [[Military Secretary (Sri Lanka)|Military Secretary]] and in January 1978 he was appointed Commander, Western Command at the [[Panagoda Cantonment]]. On February 4, 1978 he was confirmed to the rank of [[Brigadier]]. In January 1980, he was appointed as Commander, Support Forces in addition to serving as Commander, Western Command. In this capacity he was instrumental in forming the Army Provident Fund.

During this time JOC under took planning of combined operations, procurement and expansion of the armed forces. Sri Lanka faced restrictions for weapon imports from the west as the case of the US government approving the sale of [[Cadillac Gage Commando|Cadillac Gage]] [[Armored car (military)|armored car]]s without its turret and gun; as well as the British governments refusal to supply spare parts for the [[Alvis Saladin]]s and [[Ferret armoured car]]s.

Upon his return he wished to play for the [[City Rovers]] club and he turned out for them despite being told by the [[Auckland Rugby League]] that he was not eligible to play for them. City were adamant that he had been fully released and could play for any team. The New Zealand Rugby League Council supported the decision but Brown played anyway. He was subsequently suspended for 3 matches.

The issue arose after one of their players (\"King\") was suspended for four playing Saturdays. He had been suspended because he was registered with the Manukau club but \"suddenly joined, or played, for a Mangere team without having been granted a transfer\". An opposing team had protested and King had also moved back to the Manukau team. The Manukau club took exception to the decision and refused to play any of its six teams in the following grades: Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth A, and Sixth B.

It was initially decided that after the first round the bottom three teams would drop out of the competition for the second round.

He had been granted a release by Newton and the New Zealand Rugby League. Upon his return he wished to play for the [[City Rovers]] club and he turned out for them despite being told by the [[Auckland Rugby League]] that he was not eligible to play for them. City were adamant that he had been fully released and could play for any team. The New Zealand Rugby League Council supported the decision but Brown played anyway. He was subsequently suspended for 3 matches. City took the extraordinary step of withdrawing its team from the competition and they defaulted their Round 9 match with Mangere United<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Mankukau Change Over, \n| page =8\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LV, Issue 165\n| date = 1924-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240710.2.74\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref>.

The issue arose after one of their players (\"King\") was suspended for four playing Saturdays. He had been suspended because he was registered with the Manukau club but \"suddenly joined, or played, for a Mangere team without having been granted a transfer\". An opposing team had protested and King had also moved back to the Manukau team. The Manukau club took exception to the decision and refused to play any of its six teams in the following grades: Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth A, and Sixth B. It then went a step further by switching the rugby union with the Auckland Rugby Union accepting the club<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Manukau Change Over/The Reason Why/Exception Taken to League's Ruling\n| page =5\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LV, Issue 162\n| date = 1924-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240710.2.74\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref>.

This rule would come into place from Saturday, August 23 onwards.\n\n== First Grade Championship ==\nA record nine teams competed in the First Grade competition in 1924 with the addition of the Mangere and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] senior teams. Mangere had their colours registered as green and black. This team was essentially the Manukau Magpies club of today though they had a patchy existence for their first two decades. It was initially decided that after the first round the bottom three teams would drop out of the competition for the second round. At the end of the first round these teams were Mangere, and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]].

It is a garbage excuse for a song, designed to appeal to edgy middle schoolers, about starting a fight. It reached No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock]] (one week on July 26, 2003) and [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock]] (five weeks on May 31, 2003) charts and No. 16 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], as well as No. 1 on the singles recurrent charts. It crossed over to mainstream pop radio, peaking at No. 4 on the ''Billboard'' [[Mainstream Top 40]]. The song also won two [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard'' Music Awards]] in 2003 for \"Best Modern Rock Track\" and \"Best Rock Track\".\n\n\"Headstrong\" was rated the No. 1 alternative song and No. 8 rock song of the decade of the 2000s by ''Billboard''.[https://web.archive.org/web/20100114193935/http://www.billboard.com//]\n\nIn 2018, an official poll by [[Ultimate Guitar]] saw the site's users rate \"Headstrong\" as having the fourth worst [[Ostinato#Riff|riff]] of all time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/articles/features/friday_top_15_worst_riffs_of_all_time-72685 |title=Friday Top: 15 Worst Riffs of All Time |date=2 Mar 2018 |accessdate=27 Mar 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nA [[music video]] was produced for \"Headstrong\" which largely focuses on the band performing in front of a crowd. Paper and other debris are seen flying past in furious winds as the group plays in an urban nighttime setting, as well as a couple of teenagers arguing with the people they know, such as one teen getting into an argument with his father while they are in a car and the kid becomes fed up with his Dad's attitude and storms off as well as another teen quitting his job at a restaurant after getting pushed around by his boss. The two teens then join Trapt in the crowd. The video found considerable airplay on [[MTV2]] and [[Fuse (TV channel)|MMUSA]] upon release.

Paper and other debris are seen flying past in furious winds as the group plays in an urban nighttime setting, as well as a couple of teenagers arguing with the people they know, such as one teen getting into an argument with his father while they are in a car and the kid becomes fed up with his Dad's attitude and storms off as well as another teen quitting his job at a restaurant after getting pushed around by his boss. The two teens then join Trapt in the crowd. The video found considerable airplay on [[MTV2]] and [[Fuse (TV channel)|MMUSA]] upon release.

It is most known for its [[association football|football]] team.\n\n==Background==\nThe club was formed 1 February 1895 as '''IF Kamraterna''' (IFK) by two young students, Louis Zettersten and Pehr Ehnemark, and was the first [[Idrottsf\u00f6reningen Kamraterna|IFK club]]. The club soon changed name to IFK Stockholm to differentiate it from the other IFK clubs that were formed in various towns in Sweden.\n\nThe club had minor successes in the early days of Swedish football, but from 2008 to 2010, resided in Division 5, part of the regional leagues of the [[Swedish football league system]]. The club is affiliated to the [[Stockholms Fotbollf\u00f6rbund]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://svenskfotboll.se/svensk-fotboll/om-svff/distrikten/?ffid=16 |title= Kontaktuppgifter och t\u00e4vlingar&nbsp;\u2013 Stockholms Fotbollf\u00f6rbund&nbsp;\u2013 Svenskfotboll.se |format= |work= |accessdate=2011-01-13}}</ref>\n\nThe club also sponsors [[bowling]] and [[swimming (sport)|swimming]]. It formerly also sponsored [[ice hockey]] and played its home games at the [[Hovet]], formerly known as Johanneshovs Isstadion.

The men's bandy team has played seven seasons in the Swedish top division.<ref>{{cite
