For example, the [[allotropes of carbon]] include [[diamond]] (the carbon atoms are bonded together in a [[tetrahedral]] lattice arrangement), [[graphite]] (the carbon atoms are bonded together in sheets of a [[hexagonal lattice]]), [[graphene]] (single sheets of graphite), and [[fullerene]]s (the carbon atoms are bonded together in spherical, tubular, or ellipsoidal formations). The term ''allotropy'' is used for elements only, not for [[chemical compound|compounds]]. The more general term, used for any crystalline material, is [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphism]]. Allotropy refers only to different forms of an element within the same [[state of matter|phase]]  elements do not maintain distinct allotropes in different phases; for example, [[phosphorus]] has [[allotropes of phosphorus|numerous solid allotropes]], which all revert to the same P<sub>4</sub> form when melted to the liquid state.\n\n==History==\nThe concept of allotropy was originally proposed in 1841 by the Swedish scientist Baron [[J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius]] (1779\u20131848).<ref name=Jensen>{{citation | last = Jensen | first = W.

E. The Allotropy of the Elements (Elsevier 1964) that many have repeated this advice.</ref>\n\n==Differences in properties of an element's allotropes==\nAllotropes are different structural forms of the same element and can exhibit quite different physical properties and chemical behaviours. The change between allotropic forms is triggered by the same forces that affect other structures, i.e., [[pressure]], [[photochemistry|light]], and [[temperature]]. Therefore, the stability of the particular allotropes depends on particular conditions. For instance, [[iron]]  changes from a [[body-centered cubic]] structure ([[Allotropes of iron|ferrite]]) to a [[face-centered cubic]] structure ([[austenite]]) above 906&nbsp;\u00b0C, and [[tin]] undergoes a modification known as [[tin pest]] from a [[metal]]lic form to a [[semiconductor]] form below 13.2&nbsp;\u00b0C (55.8&nbsp;\u00b0F). As an example of allotropes having different chemical behaviour, ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) is a much stronger oxidizing agent than dioxygen (O<sub>2</sub>).\n\n==List of allotropes==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2009}}\n\nTypically, elements capable of variable [[coordination number]] and/or [[oxidation states]] tend to exhibit greater numbers of allotropic forms. Another contributing factor is the ability of an element to [[catenation|catenate]].\n\nExamples of allotropes include:\n\n===Non-metals===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Element\n!

For example, the [[allotropes of carbon]] include [[diamond]] (the carbon atoms are bonded together in a [[tetrahedral]] lattice arrangement), [[graphite]] (the carbon atoms are bonded together in sheets of a [[hexagonal lattice]]), [[graphene]] (single sheets of graphite), and [[fullerene]]s (the carbon atoms are bonded together in spherical, tubular, or ellipsoidal formations). The term ''allotropy'' is used for elements only, not for [[chemical compound|compounds]]. The more general term, used for any crystalline material, is [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphism]]. Allotropy refers only to different forms of an element within the same [[state of matter|phase]] (i.e.:  [[solid]], [[liquid]] or [[gas]] states); the differences between these states would not alone constitute examples of allotropy.\n\nFor some elements, allotropes have different molecular formulae despite difference in phase; for example, two [[allotropes of oxygen]] ([[oxygen|dioxygen]], O<sub>2</sub>, and [[ozone]], O<sub>3</sub>) can both exist in the solid, liquid and gaseous states. Other elements do not maintain distinct allotropes in different phases; for example, [[phosphorus]] has [[allotropes of phosphorus|numerous solid allotropes]], which all revert to the same P<sub>4</sub> form when melted to the liquid state.\n\n==History==\nThe concept of allotropy was originally proposed in 1841 by the Swedish scientist Baron [[J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius]] (1779\u20131848).<ref name=Jensen>{{citation | last = Jensen | first = W.

E. The Allotropy of the Elements (Elsevier 1964) that many have repeated this advice.</ref>\n\n==Differences in properties of an element's allotropes==\nAllotropes are different structural forms of the same element and can exhibit quite different physical properties and chemical behaviours. The change between allotropic forms is triggered by the same forces that affect other structures, i.e., [[pressure]], [[photochemistry|light]], and [[temperature]]. Therefore, the stability of the particular allotropes depends on particular conditions. For instance, [[iron]]  changes from a [[body-centered cubic]] structure ([[Allotropes of iron|ferrite]]) to a [[face-centered cubic]] structure ([[austenite]]) above 906&nbsp;\u00b0C, and [[tin]] undergoes a modification known as [[tin pest]] from a [[metal]]lic form to a [[semiconductor]] form below 13.2&nbsp;\u00b0C (55.8&nbsp;\u00b0F). As an example of allotropes having different chemical behaviour, ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) is a much stronger oxidizing agent than dioxygen (O<sub>2</sub>).\n\n==List of allotropes==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2009}}\n\nTypically, elements capable of variable [[coordination number]] and/or [[oxidation states]] tend to exhibit greater numbers of allotropic forms.

For [[Developing country|lesser-developed countries]], curing remains a key process in the production, transport and availability of meat.\n\n[[File:Prague powder No 1.jpg|thumb|186x186px|[[Curing salt]], also known as \"Prague powder\" or \"pink salt\", is typically a combination of [[sodium chloride]] and [[sodium nitrite]] that is dyed pink to distinguish it from [[table salt]]]]\nSome traditional cured meat (such as authentic [[Parma ham]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.curiouscook.com/site/2007/04/parma-and-iberian-hams-red-from-zinc.html|title=Parma and Iberian hams, red from zinc|website=Curious Cook|access-date=2019-02-08}}</ref> and some authentic Spanish chorizo and Italian [[salami]], ...) are cured with salt alone.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cochonneries : comment la charcuterie est devenue un poison|last=Coudray|first=Guillaume|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=9782707193582|location=Paris|pages=|oclc=1011036745}}</ref> Today, [[potassium nitrate]] and [[sodium nitrite]] (in conjunction with salt) are the most common agents in curing [[meat]], because they bond to the [[myoglobin]] and act as a substitute for the [[oxygen]], [https://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/meat-stays-red-myoglobin-nitrites/] thus turning myoglobin red [https://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/meat-stays-red-myoglobin-nitrites/] [https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/cured_meat_color_part_3].

In such circumstances the usefulness of preserving foods containing nutritional value for transport and storage is obvious.\n\nCuring can significantly extend the life of meat before it spoils, by making it inhospitable to the growth of spoilage microbes.\n\n== History ==\nA survival technique since [[prehistory]], the preservation of meat has become, over the centuries, a topic of political, economic, and social importance worldwide.\n\n=== Traditional methods ===\n[[File:Sacrifice pig Tarporley Painter MAN.jpg|thumb|alt=Sur un fond noir se d\u00e9tache le profil ocre d\u2019un jeune homme tenant de la main gauche le groin d\u2019une t\u00eate de porc pos\u00e9e sur un tabouret, et de la droite un long couteau, haut lev\u00e9 et pr\u00e8s \u00e0 s\u2019abattre sur la hure.|upright=0.8|Young man preparing a pig's head after a sacrifice.

This meat, after having been salted with the greatest care, was sometime smoked. These goods had to have been considerably important, since they fed part of the Roman people and the armies. The [[Belgae]] were celebrated above all for the care which they gave to the fattening of their pigs. Their herds of sheep and pigs were so many, they could provide skins and salt meat not only for Rome, but also for most of Italy.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} The Ceretani of [[Spain]] drew a large export income from their hams, which were so succulent, they were in no way inferior to those of [[Cantabria]].

The first French recipe, written in verse by [[Gace de La Bigne]], mentions in the same p\u00e2t\u00e9 three great partridges, six fat quail, and a dozen larks. ''[[Le M\u00e9nagier de Paris]]'' mentions p\u00e2t\u00e9s of fish, game, young rabbit, fresh venison, beef, pigeons, mutton, veal, and pork, and even p\u00e2t\u00e9s of lark, turtledove, cow, baby bird, goose, and hen. [[Bartolomeo Sacchi]], called Platine, prefect of the [[Vatican Library]], gives the recipe for a p\u00e2t\u00e9 of wild beasts: the flesh, after being boiled with salt and vinegar, was larded and placed inside an envelope of spiced fat, with a ''m\u00e9lange'' of pepper, cinnamon and pounded lard; one studded the fat with cloves until it was entirely covered, then placed it inside a p\u00e2te.\n\nIn the 16th century, the most fashionable p\u00e2t\u00e9s were of woodcock, au bec dor\u00e9, chapon, beef tongue, cow feet, sheep feet, chicken, veal, and venison.<ref>Paul Lacroix et Ferdinand S\u00e9r\u00e9, ''Le Moyen \u00c2ge et la Renaissance, histoire et description des m\u0153urs et usages, du commerce et de l\u2019industrie, des sciences, des arts, des litt\u00e9ratures et des beaux-arts en Europe'', T.

The need to properly feed soldiers during long campaigns outside the country, such as in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and to nourish a constantly growing population often living in appalling conditions drove scientific research, but a confectioner, [[Nicolas Appert]], in 1795 developed through experimentation a method which became universal and in one language bears his name: airtight storage, called ''{{lang|fr|appertisation}}'' in French.\n\nWith the spread of ''appertisation'', the 19th-century world entered the era of the \"[[food industry]]\", which developed new products such as canned salt meat (for example [[corned beef]]), but also led to lowered standards of food quality and hygiene{{dubious|date=April 2017}} \u2013 such as those [[Upton Sinclair]] described in ''[[The Jungle]]''.

Nitrite salts are most often used in curing. Nitrate is specifically used only in a few curing conditions and products where nitrite (which may be generated from nitrate) must be generated in the product over long periods of time.\n\nNitrite further breaks down in the meat into [[nitric oxide]] (NO), which then binds to the iron atom in the center of [[myoglobin|myoglobin's]] [[heme]] group, reducing oxidation and causing a reddish-brown color (nitrosomyoglobin) when raw and the characteristic cooked-ham pink color (nitrosohemochrome or nitrosyl-heme) when cooked. The addition of ascorbate to cured meat reduces formation of [[nitrosamine]]s (see below), but increases the [[nitrosyl]]ation of iron.\n\nThe use of nitrite and nitrate salts for meat in the US has been formally used since 1925.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Because of the relatively high toxicity of nitrite (the lethal dose in humans is about 22&nbsp;mg/kg of body weight), the maximum allowed nitrite concentration in meat products is 200 [[parts per million|ppm]].

It can be done in combination with other curing methods such as salting. Common smoking styles include hot smoking, smoke roasting (pit barbecuing) and cold smoking.  Smoke roasting and hot smoking cook the meat while cold smoking does not.

Nitrite salts are most often used in curing. Nitrate is specifically used only in a few curing conditions and products where nitrite (which may be generated from nitrate) must be generated in the product over long periods of time.\n\nNitrite further breaks down in the meat into [[nitric oxide]] (NO), which then binds to the iron atom in the center of [[myoglobin|myoglobin's]] [[heme]] group, reducing oxidation and causing a reddish-brown color (nitrosomyoglobin) when raw and the characteristic cooked-ham pink color (nitrosohemochrome or nitrosyl-heme) when cooked. The addition of ascorbate to cured meat reduces formation of [[nitrosamine]]s (see below), but increases the [[nitrosyl]]ation of iron.\n\nThe use of nitrite and nitrate salts for meat in the US has been formally used since 1925.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Because of the relatively high toxicity of nitrite (the lethal dose in humans is about 22&nbsp;mg/kg of body weight), the maximum allowed nitrite concentration in meat products is 200 [[parts per million|ppm]].

It can be done in combination with other curing methods such as salting. Common smoking styles include hot smoking, smoke roasting (pit barbecuing) and cold smoking.  Smoke roasting and hot smoking cook the meat while cold smoking does not. If the meat is cold smoked, it should be dried quickly to limit bacterial growth during the critical period where the meat is not yet dry. This can be achieved, as with [[jerky]], by slicing the meat thinly.\n\nThe smoking of food directly with wood smoke is known to contaminate the food with carcinogenic [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]].<ref>''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7447916 Fritz W, et.al.: Smoked food and cancer] US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health''</ref>\n\n== Effect of meat preservation ==\n=== On health ===\nSince the 20th century, with respect to the relationship between diet and human disease (e.g. cardiovascular, etc.), scientists have conducted studies on the effects of [[lipolysis]] on vacuum-packed or frozen meat.

An often used example is \"putting a gun to someone's head\" (''at gunpoint'') or putting a \"knife under the throat\" (''at knifepoint'' or cut-throat) to compel action or the victim gets killed or injured.

However, there also are nonphysical forms of coercion, where the threatened injury does not immediately imply the use of force. Byman and Waxman (2000) define coercion as \"the use of threatened force, including the limited use of actual force to back up the threat, to induce an adversary to behave differently than it otherwise would.\"<ref>Byman, Daniel L.; Waxman, Matthew C.: ''Kosovo and the Great Air Power Debate'', ''[[International Security]]'', Vol. 24, No. 4 (Spring, 2000), pp. 5\u201338.</ref> Coercion does not in many cases amount to destruction of property or life since compliance is the goal.\n\n===Psychological===\n[[File:Jimbo Wales 2005.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Scholars have noted that [[Wikipedia]] co-founder [[Jimbo Wales]] often uses coercion with his editors. Psychological threats and [[culpability]] are commonplace on the online encyclopedia, and Wales has promoted a [[climate of fear]].]]\nIn [[psychological coercion]], the threatened injury regards the victim's relationships with other people. The most obvious example is ''[[blackmail]]'', where the threat consists of the dissemination of damaging information. However, many other types are possible e.g. \"[[emotional blackmail]]\", which typically involves threats of rejection from or disapproval by a peer-group, or creating feelings of guilt/obligation via a display of anger or hurt by someone whom the victim loves or respects. Another example is [[coercive persuasion]].\n\nPsychological coercion \u2013 along with the other varieties \u2013 was extensively and systematically used by the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] during the \"[[Thought reform in China|Thought Reform]]\" campaign of 1951\u20131952. The process \u2013 carried out partly at \"revolutionary universities\" and partly within prisons \u2013 was investigated and reported by [[Robert Jay Lifton]], then Research Professor of Psychiatry at Yale University: see Lifton (1961). The techniques used by the Chinese authorities included a technique derived from standard [[group psychotherapy]], which was aimed at forcing the victims (who were generally intellectuals) to produce detailed and sincere ideological \"confessions\". For instance, a professor of [[formal logic]] called Chin Yueh-lin \u2013 who was then regarded as China's leading authority on his subject \u2013 was induced to write: \"The new philosophy [of [[Marxism-Leninism]]], being scientific, is the supreme truth\" [Lifton (1961) p.&nbsp;545].\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Abusive power and control]]\n* [[Coercive control]]\n* [[Coercive power]]\n* [[Deterrence (legal)]]\n* [[Duress in American law]]\n* [[Duress in English law]]\n* [[Marital coercion]]\n* [[Monopoly on violence]]\n* [[Punishment (psychology)]]\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite web | last=Anderson | first=Scott A. | date=n.d. | title=Towards a Better Theory of Coercion, and a Use for It | publisher=The University of Chicago | url=http://ptw.uchicago.edu/Anderson02.pdf | accessdate=12 October 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308180431/http://ptw.uchicago.edu/Anderson02.pdf | archive-date=8 March 2005 }}\n* Lifton, Robert J.

Byman and Waxman (2000) define coercion as \"the use of threatened force, including the limited use of actual force to back up the threat, to induce an adversary to behave differently than it otherwise would.\"<ref>Byman, Daniel L.; Waxman, Matthew C.: ''Kosovo and the Great Air Power Debate'', ''[[International Security]]'', Vol. 24, No. 4 (Spring, 2000), pp. 5\u201338.</ref> Coercion does not in many cases amount to destruction of property or life since compliance is the goal.\n\n===Psychological===\n[[File:Jimbo Wales 2005.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Scholars have noted that [[Wikipedia]] co-founder [[Jimbo Wales]] often uses coercion with his editors. Psychological threats and [[culpability]] are commonplace on the online encyclopedia, and Wales has promoted a [[climate of fear]].]]\nIn [[psychological coercion]], the threatened injury regards the victim's relationships with other people. The most obvious example is ''[[blackmail]]'', where the threat consists of the dissemination of damaging information. However, many other types are possible e.g. \"[[emotional blackmail]]\", which typically involves threats of rejection from or disapproval by a peer-group, or creating feelings of guilt/obligation via a display of anger or hurt by someone whom the victim loves or respects. Another example is [[coercive persuasion]].\n\nPsychological coercion \u2013 along with the other varieties \u2013 was extensively and systematically used by the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] during the \"[[Thought reform in China|Thought Reform]]\" campaign of 1951\u20131952. The process \u2013 carried out partly at \"revolutionary universities\" and partly within prisons \u2013 was investigated and reported by [[Robert Jay Lifton]], then Research Professor of Psychiatry at Yale University: see Lifton (1961). The techniques used by the Chinese authorities included a technique derived from standard [[group psychotherapy]], which was aimed at forcing the victims (who were generally intellectuals) to produce detailed and sincere ideological \"confessions\". For instance, a professor of [[formal logic]] called Chin Yueh-lin \u2013 who was then regarded as China's leading authority on his subject \u2013 was induced to write: \"The new philosophy [of [[Marxism-Leninism]]], being scientific, is the supreme truth\" [Lifton (1961) p.&nbsp;545].\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Abusive power and control]]\n* [[Coercive control]]\n* [[Coercive power]]\n* [[Deterrence (legal)]]\n* [[Duress in American law]]\n* [[Duress in English law]]\n* [[Marital coercion]]\n* [[Monopoly on violence]]\n* [[Punishment (psychology)]]\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite web | last=Anderson | first=Scott A. | date=n.d. | title=Towards a Better Theory of Coercion, and a Use for It | publisher=The University of Chicago | url=http://ptw.uchicago.edu/Anderson02.pdf | accessdate=12 October 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308180431/http://ptw.uchicago.edu/Anderson02.pdf | archive-date=8 March 2005 }}\n* Lifton, Robert J.

A disturbance formed near the [[International Date Line]], and strengthened into a [[Tropical cyclone|tropical depression]] on November&nbsp;27.  The [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center|Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)]] reported that the depression had reached tropical storm intensity near the Marshall Islands on November 28, thus naming it Zelda. Near the country on November&nbsp;29, the storm quickly strengthened to {{convert|65|kn|km/h mph|round=5|lk=on}} according to the JTWC, equivalent to a Category&nbsp;1 [[typhoon]] on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale]].  It reached a peak of {{convert|80|kn|km/h mph|abbr=on|round=5}} according to the JTWC, and {{convert|60|kn|km/h mph|abbr=on|round=5}} according to the [[Japanese Meteorological Agency|Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA)]], with a [[barometric pressure]] of {{convert|975|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}}.  The tropical storm traveled northwest, then northeast.  Zelda weakened into a tropical storm on December 2, and then a tropical depression two days later.  The JTWC discontinued warnings late on December&nbsp;4, while the JMA declared the storm to be [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] the next day and continued to track the storm, until it crossed the International Date Line again on December 7.\n\nZelda caused significant damage to the Marshall Islands, and operations at [[Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site|Kwajalein Missile Range]] were disrupted severely.  No deaths or injuries were reported. About 60&nbsp;percent of homes were destroyed in [[Ebeye]], leaving 6,000&nbsp;people without residence.  Nearly all crops on the islands were destroyed, and food and other supplies were contaminated by salt.  Later in December, [[President of the United States]] [[George H. W. Bush]] declared the storm to be a major disaster, allowing the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)]] to assist.  The Marshall Islands also requested funds from other countries.\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{Storm path|Zelda 1991 track.png|alt=Map of the western Pacific Ocean depicting the track of Tropical Storm Zelda, through the Marshall Islands and its re-curvature}}\nIn late November, a [[atmospheric circulation|circulation]] was generated near the International Date Line by [[westerly wind burst|westerly winds]]. It was included in the Significant Tropical Weather Advisory at 0600&nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on November&nbsp;25.

A disturbance formed near the [[International Date Line]], and strengthened into a [[Tropical cyclone|tropical depression]] on November&nbsp;27.  The [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center|Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)]] reported that the depression had reached tropical storm intensity near the Marshall Islands on November 28, thus naming it Zelda. Near the country on November&nbsp;29, the storm quickly strengthened to {{convert|65|kn|km/h mph|round=5|lk=on}} according to the JTWC, equivalent to a Category&nbsp;1 [[typhoon]] on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale]].  It reached a peak of {{convert|80|kn|km/h mph|abbr=on|round=5}} according to the JTWC, and {{convert|60|kn|km/h mph|abbr=on|round=5}} according to the [[Japanese Meteorological Agency|Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA)]], with a [[barometric pressure]] of {{convert|975|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}}.  The tropical storm traveled northwest, then northeast.  Zelda weakened into a tropical storm on December 2, and then a tropical depression two days later.  The JTWC discontinued warnings late on December&nbsp;4, while the JMA declared the storm to be [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] the next day and continued to track the storm, until it crossed the International Date Line again on December 7.\n\nZelda caused significant damage to the Marshall Islands, and operations at [[Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site|Kwajalein Missile Range]] were disrupted severely.  No deaths or injuries were reported. About 60&nbsp;percent of homes were destroyed in [[Ebeye]], leaving 6,000&nbsp;people without residence.  Nearly all crops on the islands were destroyed, and food and other supplies were contaminated by salt.  Later in December, [[President of the United States]] [[George H. W. Bush]] declared the storm to be a major disaster, allowing the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)]] to assist.  The Marshall Islands also requested funds from other countries.\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{Storm path|Zelda 1991 track.png|alt=Map of the western Pacific Ocean depicting the track of Tropical Storm Zelda, through the Marshall Islands and its re-curvature}}\nIn late November, a [[atmospheric circulation|circulation]] was generated near the International Date Line by [[westerly wind burst|westerly winds]].

{"title_page": "The Philosophy of Money", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{italic title}}\n'''''The Philosophy of Money''''' (1900) is a book on [[economic sociology]] by the German [[sociologist]] and [[social philosopher]], [[Georg Simmel]].<ref name=\"Sociological Theory 158\">Simmel, George. Georg Simmel. Sociological Theory. 7th ed. New York: The McGraw-Hill Companies, 2008. 158\u201388. Print.</ref> Probably considered Simmel's greatest work, Simmel saw [[money]] as a [[structure|structuring]] agent that helps us understand the totality of life.<ref name=\"Sociological Theory 158\"/>\n\n==Money and value==\nSimmel believed people created [[economic value|value]] by making objects, then separating themselves from those objects and then trying to overcome that distance. He found that objects that were too close were not considered valuable and objects that were too far away for people to obtain were also not considered valuable. What was also considered in determining value was the [[scarcity]], time, sacrifice, and difficulties involved in getting objects. In the pre-modern era, beginning with [[bartering]], different systems of exchange for [[goods]] and services allowed for the existence of incomparable systems of value (land, food, honor, love, etc.). With the advent of a universal [[currency]] as an intermediary, these systems became reconcilable, as everything tended to become expressible in a single quantifiable metric: its [[monetary cost]].\n\n==Money and freedom==\nA fundamental point of ''The Philosophy of Money'' is that money brings about [[personal freedom]]. The effect of freedom can be appreciated by considering the evolution of economic [[obligation]]s. When someone is a [[slave]], their whole person is subject to the master. The [[peasant]] has more freedom, but if they are to provide the lord with payments in kind, such as wheat or cattle, they must produce exactly the item required, or [[barter]] it at a great loss or inconvenience. But when the obligation takes a monetary form, the peasant is free as to whether to grow wheat, or keep cattle, or engage in other activities, as long as they pay the required tax.\n\nFreedom also arises because money enables an economic system of increasing complexity in which any single relation becomes less important and thus more impersonal. As a result, the individual experiences a sense of [[independence]] and [[self-sufficiency]]. There is another sense in which money is conducive to freedom, and it originates from the observation that the owner is truly entitled to its possessions only if he takes care of its upkeep and of making it bear fruits. Money is more flexible than land or other assets, and thus it frees the owner from those activities that are specific to real entities. Since monetary possessions no longer ties the owner to a specific type of work, money leads to increased freedom. Consequently, monetary ownership enables the position of a purely intellectual worker and, by the same line of reasoning, it also implies that a wealthy man can lead a modest life. As for workers and managers, they only contribute work for wages and only deal with an impersonal market, and thus their personality is separated from specific work activities. In the case of civil servants, they are paid a fixed salary that is largely independent of any specific work performance, and see their personality freed from work activities. The same hold for artists, such as a musician who is paid the same fee regardless of how well he plays.\n   \nAlthough the monetary system enhances individual freedom, it can also lead to consequences that are questionable. An employee does not necessarily have better living conditions than a slave does, as a precise amount of money corresponds imprecisely to its effective purchasing power.  In a money economy, individuals will tend to put their financial interests above the goals of society or of the state. If a peasant sells his land even for a fair price, monetary freedom differs from the personal activity afforded by possession of the land.  More generally, freedom from something does not necessarily equate with the freedom to do something else because money is \"empty\" and flexible, and does not direct the owner toward any specific activity.  Although monetary payments can free from the obligations of specific in-kind contributions, it has also the effect of removing the involvement of the individual from a broader context. For example, when the Athenian vassal states had to contribute with ships and troops, the tributaries were directly involved in [[Athens]]'s foreign and military policy, at least to the extent that drafted soldiers could not effectively be deployed against their home states. Once the military contribution was replaced by a monetary tribute, no such constraint could be placed on Athens's policy. The natural evolution of this state of affairs is that despotic regimes tend to favor a monetary economy.\n\n==Personal values==\nPersonal values can be quantified in terms of equivalent money amounts. An example is the [[weregild]], the monetary value that must be paid to a family if one of his members is killed. The weregild was truly a reflection of personal values, in this case of a lost life, rather than the compensation for the income stream that the deceased would have provided to the family. Similarly, personal values are also quantified by the practice of marriage by purchase and of prostitution. However, the historical trend has been toward an increased awareness of individual distinctions whereas money is intrinsically fungible. As a result, money has been progressively considered as an inappropriate equivalent to personal values, and most of these practices have fallen into disuse. When these practices survive, the amount of money is so large that it introduces an affective element in the transaction. A wife purchased for an exorbitant amount is especially dear to the heart.\n\nMoney is fungible and, as such, it stands in sharp contrast with the idea of ''distinction'', according to which an entity is set apart from and incomparable with a majority. Distinction is a property of nobility, or of some works of art, for example. Simmel takes as a case in point the [[House of Lords]], which functions as the sole judge of its members and at the same time refuses to sit in judgment of any other individual. In this sense, the Lords value distinction to the extent that even the exercise of authority on other people would be seen as a degradation. The quantitative aspects of money has the potential to threaten and debase the qualitative notion of distinction.\n\n==Style of life==\nAs values can be quantified in monetary terms, our relationship with objects has lost most of its emotional character and has become more intellectual. On the one hand, our rational attitude can lead us to become individualistic, to an atomization of society, and even to disregard respect and kindness. On the other hand, there are often clear advantages in relying on intellect rather than on emotions. At any rate, Simmel maintains that intellect is a tool and, as such, it lacks an intrinsic sense of direction and can be put to use for different purposes. Rationality originates from the objective, purely arithmetic nature of money, and is mirrored by the tenet that law is equal for everyone and that in a democracy all votes are equal. \nThe ability of fitting in an increasingly intellectual environment is reinforced by education, which in turn is mostly accessible to those who can afford it. As a result, money can lead to the creation of a de facto aristocracy of the affluent. The converse is that egalitarian tendencies typically reject the money system.\n\nThe objective nature of money ultimately arises from the division of labor, in which the product is divorced from the worker's personality and work is treated as a commodity. Similarly, products are no longer tailored to the specific customer and do not reflect his personality, production tools are specialized to the point that the worker has little leeway in the way he operates the machines, and fashion changes so rapidly that nobody gets personally or socially attached to it. This state of affairs stands in contrast with the arts, which reflects the individuality of the author. Money can increase the distance between individuals to the point that it allows them to fit in crowded cities and to liberate individuals from the yoke of working on a family business. (Incidentally, financial activities are concentrated in major cities, and the concentration of money increases the pace and variety of life.) Humankind has become progressively more independent of the rhythms of nature and more dependent on the business cycle. \n\"Objects and people have become separated from one another\" declares Simmel, and was to compare this phenomenon with [[Marx's theory of alienation]].<ref name=\"SimmelOnRodin\">{{cite book |last1=Simmel |first1=Georg |last2=Frisby |first2=David |last3=Featherstone |first3=Mike |title=Simmel on Culture |date=23 January 1998 |publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd. |isbn=978-0803986527 |page=70 |edition=First |ref=SimmelOnRodin}}</ref>\n\nMoney rises above individual conflicts while being an essential participant of the conflict.\nIt has transcended its characteristics of a tool when it has become the center around which the economic system rotates, at which point it also takes the role of an all-encompassing teleological circle. Simmel was to compare this phenomenon with Marx's [[commodity fetishism]].<ref name=\"SimmelOnRodin\"/>\n\nYet, division of labor makes it possible to construct intellectual and scientific contents that surpass the ability of the individual mind. Even in these cases, though, it may be essential that a synthesis be accomplished by a single mind. Similarly, as material concerns become impersonal, what is left can become more personal. For example, as the typewriter has relieved the writer from the cumbersome mechanics of writing, he can devote more attention to the original contents of his work. It really depends on humankind whether money will lead to increase distinctiveness and refinement or not.\n\n==Social effects of money==\nSimmel's outlook, while gloomy, is not wholly negative. As money and transactions increase, the independence of an individual decreases as he or she is drawn into a holistic network of exchange governed by quantifiable monetary value. Paradoxically, this results in greater potential freedom of choice for the individual, as money can be deployed toward any possible goal, even if most people's sheer lack of money renders that potential quite low much of the time. Money's homogenizing nature encourages greater liberty and equality and melts away forms of feudalism and patronage, even as it minimizes exceptional, incommensurable achievements in art and love.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Portal bar|Society}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Philosophy of Money}}\n[[Category:1900 non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:German non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:Economic sociology]]\n[[Category:Finance books]]\n[[Category:Social philosophy literature]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{italic title}}\n'''''The Philosophy of Money''''' (1900) is a book on [[economic sociology]] by the German [[sociologist]] and [[social philosopher]], [[Georg Simmel]].<ref name=\"Sociological Theory 158\">Simmel, George.
