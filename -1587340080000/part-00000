Its primary purpose is the home venue of the [[Ohio State Buckeyes football]] team; it also serves as the site for the university's Spring Commencement ceremonies each May.\n\nFrom 1996 to 1998, Ohio Stadium was the home venue for the [[Columbus Crew]] of [[Major League Soccer]] prior to the opening of [[Columbus Crew Stadium]] in 1999. The stadium also was the home venue for the OSU track and field teams from 1923 to 2001. In addition to athletics, Ohio Stadium is also a concert venue, with [[U2]], [[Taylor Swift]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Pink Floyd]], and [[Metallica]] among the many acts to have played at the venue.\n\nThe stadium opened in 1922 as a replacement for [[Ohio Field]] and had a [[seating capacity]] of 66,210. In 1923, a cinder running track was added that was later upgraded to an all-weather track. Seating capacity gradually increased over the years and reached a total of 91,470 possible spectators in 1991. Beginning in 2000, the stadium was renovated and expanded in several phases, removing the track and adding additional seating, which raised the capacity to 101,568 by 2001 and to 102,329 in 2007. In 2014, additional seating was added in the end zone, raising the official capacity to 104,944. Another renovation to add more luxury suites began in 2017 and will eventually lead to a decrease of 2,600 seats.  It is the largest stadium by capacity in the state of Ohio, and the [[List of U.S. stadiums by capacity|third largest]] on-campus football stadium in the United States. Ohio Stadium was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] by the [[National Park Service]] on March 22, 1974.<ref name=nris/>\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Ohio Stadium from the air July 2014.jpg|thumb|Aerial photograph of Ohio Stadium]]\nAs early as 1913, Ohio Field at High Street and Woodruff Avenue was unable to contain the crowds attracted to many Buckeye home football games. This led to faculty discussion of moving the site elsewhere and building a new facility. The growing popularity of football in [[Ohio]] led to the design of a horseshoe-shaped stadium, conceptualized and designed by architect [[Howard Dwight Smith]] in 1918. A public-subscription Stadium Campaign to fund the project began in October 1920 and raised over $1.1&nbsp;million in pledges by January 1921, of which $975,001 were actually honored.\n<ref name=\"ballparks\">{{Cite web |url=http://football.ballparks.com/NCAA/Big10/OhioState/index.htm |title=Ballparks.com - Ohio Stadium |access-date=2006-08-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022100854/http://football.ballparks.com/NCAA/Big10/OhioState/index.htm |archive-date=2006-10-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe stadium was built in 1922 by E. H. Latham Company of Columbus, with materials and labor from the [[Marble Cliff Quarry Co.]] at a construction cost of $1.34&nbsp;million and a total cost of $1.49&nbsp;million. The stadium's original capacity was 66,210. Upon completion, it was the largest poured concrete structure in the world. Many university officials feared that the stadium would never be filled to capacity.<ref name=ballparks/>\n\nSmith employed numerous revolutionary architectural techniques while building the stadium. At the base is a [[slurry wall]] to keep out the waters from the [[Olentangy River]]; the stadium rests on the flood plain. Instead of building a large bowl like the previously constructed [[Yale Bowl]], Ohio Stadium was designed to have an upper deck that would hang over part of the lower deck, giving Ohio Stadium its \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\" decks. Instead of employing numerous columns like those at [[Harvard Stadium]], Smith designed double columns that allow for more space between columns. The rotunda at the north end of the stadium, which is now adorned with stained glass murals of the offensive and defensive squads that comprise the Buckeye football team,<ref>{{cite press release|title=Motorists Insurance Gife Supports Ohio Stadium Enhancement and Renovation|publisher=Ohio State University|date=June 5, 2001|url=http://www.osu.edu/osu/newsrel/Archive/01-06-05_Ohio_Stadium_Art_Glass_Gift.html|accessdate=August 20, 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902170038/http://www.osu.edu/osu/newsrel/Archive/01-06-05_Ohio_Stadium_Art_Glass_Gift.html|archivedate=September 2, 2006}}</ref> was designed to look like the dome at the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome.\n\n==History==\nThe first game in the stadium was against [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] on October 7, 1922, and brought a crowd of around 25,000, which left people concerned because the stadium was half empty. This concern was put to rest at the stadium's formal dedication against Michigan on October 21, which the Wolverines won, 19&ndash;0. The crowd was announced at the game to be 72,000, but no one is really sure how many people made it into the stadium. This attendance mark was broken in a game against Michigan in 1926 when 90,411 came out to support the Buckeyes; this is also the last time standing-room-only tickets were sold for a game.<ref name=ballparks/>\n\nThe stadium did not regularly sell out until after World War II, and in the 1920s and 1930s most games only drew in 20,000 or 30,000 fans with many more attending the annual game against Michigan. The 1935 contest with [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] was a sellout, with over 81,000 in attendance.\n\nIn 1923, a cinder track was built around the football field, which would later be named after Olympian and Ohio State athlete [[Jesse Owens]]. The stadium was home to the OSU [[track and field]] teams until the opening of [[Jesse Owens Memorial Stadium]] in 2001.<ref name=ballparks/>\n\n===Renovations===\nAs time passed, minor adjustments raised the [[seating capacity]] to more than 90,000. In 1984, a new $2.1&nbsp;million scoreboard was installed. The stadium was heavily renovated from 1998 to 2001. The press box was replaced, additional seating was installed, and 81 luxury suites and 2,500 club seats were added. The south end zone scoreboard was also replaced by a {{convert|90|x|30|ft|adj=on}} video board that is able to show replays, highlights, animations, graphics and statistical information. Additionally, a smaller version of the south end scoreboard was added to the north end and a new LED ribbon board that runs end-zone to end-zone was added to the balcony prior to the 2009 season. In 1998, the track was removed and a {{convert|45|ft|m|sing=on}} [[slurry wall]] was built underneath the field to allow it to be lowered {{convert|14.5|ft|m}}, which places it below the water table. After the 1999 season, the field of play was lowered to add seating closer to the field.<ref>{{cite web |title=Part 2: Stadium Renovation 1998-2000 |url=http://buckeyeturf.osu.edu/index.php?option=com_content&id=907:part-2stadium-renovation-1998-2000&Itemid=170 |author=Sherratt, Pam |work=Buckeye Turf |publisher=[[The Ohio State University]] |accessdate=January 10, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110212219/http://buckeyeturf.osu.edu/index.php?option=com_content&id=907:part-2stadium-renovation-1998-2000&Itemid=170 |archive-date=January 10, 2015 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The temporary bleachers in the south end zone were replaced with permanent seating.

The result of the $194&nbsp;million renovation was a capacity that rose to 101,568. 80% of the cost of the renovation was funded by the sale of leases on the suites and club seats, with the remaining 20% funded by donations and the sale of naming rights for portions of the stadium. No public or university money was spent in the renovation process.<ref name=ballparks/>\n\nIn 1971, the natural grass field was removed, and [[AstroTurf]] was installed, compliments of a donation by Lou Fisher in dedication to fellow football player Joseph Campanella. A plaque was placed on the southeast corner in memory of Campanella. In 1979, the surface was replaced with SuperTurf. In 1990, natural grass made its return to the Horseshoe, in the form of a special grass called \"Prescription Athletic Turf.\" New field designs were put in place for the 1992 season and existed through the 2006 season. During the 2006 season, problems with the natural grass began to arise. After serious damage to the field during use in the spring of 2006, the field never recovered and had to be re-sodded. That grass never took root because of bad weather, and the university was forced to re-sod the field again only three weeks after the old sod was laid. The university spent approximately $150,000 to perform both soddings. In response to this, OSU replaced the natural grass with [[FieldTurf]] for the 2007 season. This new artificial turf looks and feels like real grass but requires minimal upkeep.\n\nIn March 2012 the university announced a $7&nbsp;million renovation to the scoreboard installed during the 2000\u201301 renovation. The project began April 23 and was completed in time for the 2012 season opener on September 1. The current scoreboard includes a Panasonic HD screen, stretching {{convert|124|by|42|ft}}, and incorporates upgrades to the audio system and the [[LED]] running boards (which are the smaller screens underneath the larger screen that usually display score updates and advertisements). A Pro Sound audio system with 25 different speakers flank the scoreboard. Older speakers throughout the Horseshoe received improvements and will eventually be replaced by new speakers fitted into the existing framework.\n\nPrior to the 2014 season, 2,500 seats were added to the south stands. These seats were built over the entrance tunnels and raised the official capacity of the stadium to 104,851, making it the third largest stadium in the country and the fourth largest stadium in the world. The renovations also included permanent lights added to the northeast and southeast corners of the stadium, as well as atop the press box, and the playing surface was replaced.<ref name=ballparks/><ref name=archivesB>{{cite web |title=2014 Ohio Stadium Renovations |work=Scribd. |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/146179633/Ohio-Stadium |accessdate=June 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611011432/http://www.scribd.com/doc/146179633/Ohio-Stadium |archive-date=June 11, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>[[File:Panoramic view of Ohio Stadium.jpg|thumb|right|Panoramic view.|500px]]\n\n=== Timeline of seating capacity<ref>[http://www.ohiostatebuckeyes.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=17300&KEY=&ATCLID=925256 Ohio Stadium - The Ohio State Buckeyes Official Athletics Site - OhioStateBuckeyes.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725033140/http://www.ohiostatebuckeyes.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=17300&KEY=&ATCLID=925256|date=2011-07-25}}</ref> ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}}\"|Capacity\n!style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}}\"|Years\n|-\n|66,210\n|1922\u20131943\n|-\n|72,754\n|1944\u20131947\n|-\n|78,677\n|1948\u20131957\n|-\n|79,658\n|1958\u20131960\n|-\n|79,727\n|1961\n|-\n|81,109\n|1962\u20131968\n|-\n|81,455\n|1969\u20131970\n|-\n|81,475\n|1971\n|-\n|81,667\n|1972\n|-\n|82,567\n|1973\n|-\n|83,080\n|1974\n|-\n|83,112\n|1975\u20131981\n|-\n|85,290\n|1982\u20131984\n|-\n|85,399\n|1985\u20131988\n|-\n|86,071\n|1989\u20131990\n|-\n|91,470\n|1991\u20131994\n|-\n|89,841\n|1995\u20131999\n|-\n|95,346\n|2000\n|-\n|101,568\n|2001\u20132006\n|-\n|102,329\n|2007\u20132014\n|-\n|104,944\n|2014\u20132017\n|-\n|102,082\n|2018\n|-\n|102,780\n|2019\n|}\n\n===Night football games===\nBefore the 2014 renovations, Ohio Stadium did not have permanent lights at the stadium, thus night games were rare. Ohio State's first night game in the stadium was played on September 14, 1985, when the #9 Buckeyes defeated the [[1985 Pittsburgh Panthers football team|Pittsburgh Panthers]], 10\u20137. Ohio State did not play another night game at Ohio Stadium until September 11, 1993, when the 16th-ranked Buckeyes defeated #12 [[1993 Washington Huskies football team|Washington]] 21\u201312. Ohio State played a total of 12 more night games before permanent lighting was installed, nine of which were against ranked opponents. The Buckeyes are 16-5 (.762) overall and 9-1 (.900) in the Big Ten in night games through September 18, 2017. Ohio State's most recent night game was a 34\u201310 win versus Michigan State on October 5th, 2019.\n\nBelow is a table of teams the Buckeyes have faced in multiple night games at Ohio Stadium.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}};\"|Matchups!!style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}};\"|Opponent!!style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}};\"|OSU Record\n|-\n|3||Penn State||2-1\n|-\n|2\n|Nebraska\n|2-0\n|-\n|2||Washington||2-0\n|-\n|2||Wisconsin||2-0\n|}\n\n===Largest attendance===\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}};\"|Rank !! style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}};\"|Date !! style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}};\"|Attendance !! style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}};\"|Result\n|-\n| 1 || November 26, 2016 || 110,045 || #2 Ohio State 30 \u2013 #3 Michigan 27 (2 OT)\n|-\n|2\n|October 28, 2017\n|109,302\n|#6 Ohio State 39 - #2 Penn State 38\n|-\n|3\n|September 9, 2017\n|109,088\n|#5 Oklahoma 31 \u2013 #2 Ohio State 16\n|-\n|4|| November 21, 2015 || 108,975 || #9 Michigan State 17 \u2013 #3 Ohio State 14\n|-\n|5||November 5, 2016||108,750|| #6 Ohio State 62 \u2013 #10 Nebraska 3\n|-\n|6|| November 29, 2014 || 108,610 || #6 Ohio State 42 \u2013 Michigan 28\n|-\n|7|| October 17, 2015 || 108,423 || #1 Ohio State 38 \u2013 Penn State 10\n|-\n|8|| September 16, 2017 || 108,414 || #8 Ohio State 38 \u2013 Army 7\n|-\n|9\n|September 27, 2014\n|108,362<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/boxscore?gameId=400547674|title=Barrett, Elliott lead Buckeyes by Bearcats, 50-28|date=September 27, 2014|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=September 27, 2014|agency=Associated Press|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140929012452/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/boxscore?gameId=400547674|archive-date=September 29, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n|#22 Ohio State 50 \u2013 Cincinnati 28\n|-\n|10|| November 7, 2015 || 108,075<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohiostatebuckeyes.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/110815aab.html|title=Ohio State Postgame Notes|website=www.ohiostatebuckeyes.com|accessdate=2015-11-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304190842/http://www.ohiostatebuckeyes.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/110815aab.html|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=live}}</ref> || #3 Ohio State 28 \u2013 Minnesota 14\n|}\n\n==Buckeye football==\n[[File:Script Ohio.jpg|thumb|250px|Script Ohio]]\nThe largest crowd in stadium history is 110,045, set November 26, 2016, in a game against Michigan.

Its primary purpose is the home venue of the [[Ohio State Buckeyes football]] team; it also serves as the site for the university's Spring Commencement ceremonies each May.\n\nFrom 1996 to 1998, Ohio Stadium was the home venue for the [[Columbus Crew]] of [[Major League Soccer]] prior to the opening of [[Columbus Crew Stadium]] in 1999. The stadium also was the home venue for the OSU track and field teams from 1923 to 2001. In addition to athletics, Ohio Stadium is also a concert venue, with [[U2]], [[Taylor Swift]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Pink Floyd]], and [[Metallica]] among the many acts to have played at the venue.\n\nThe stadium opened in 1922 as a replacement for [[Ohio Field]] and had a [[seating capacity]] of 66,210. In 1923, a cinder running track was added that was later upgraded to an all-weather track. Seating capacity gradually increased over the years and reached a total of 91,470 possible spectators in 1991. Beginning in 2000, the stadium was renovated and expanded in several phases, removing the track and adding additional seating, which raised the capacity to 101,568 by 2001 and to 102,329 in 2007. In 2014, additional seating was added in the end zone, raising the official capacity to 104,944. Another renovation to add more luxury suites began in 2017 and will eventually lead to a decrease of 2,600 seats.  It is the largest stadium by capacity in the state of Ohio, and the [[List of U.S. stadiums by capacity|third largest]] on-campus football stadium in the United States. Ohio Stadium was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] by the [[National Park Service]] on March 22, 1974.<ref name=nris/>\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Ohio Stadium from the air July 2014.jpg|thumb|Aerial photograph of Ohio Stadium]]\nAs early as 1913, Ohio Field at High Street and Woodruff Avenue was unable to contain the crowds attracted to many Buckeye home football games. This led to faculty discussion of moving the site elsewhere and building a new facility. The growing popularity of football in [[Ohio]] led to the design of a horseshoe-shaped stadium, conceptualized and designed by architect [[Howard Dwight Smith]] in 1918. A public-subscription Stadium Campaign to fund the project began in October 1920 and raised over $1.1&nbsp;million in pledges by January 1921, of which $975,001 were actually honored.\n<ref name=\"ballparks\">{{Cite web |url=http://football.ballparks.com/NCAA/Big10/OhioState/index.htm |title=Ballparks.com - Ohio Stadium |access-date=2006-08-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022100854/http://football.ballparks.com/NCAA/Big10/OhioState/index.htm |archive-date=2006-10-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe stadium was built in 1922 by E. H. Latham Company of Columbus, with materials and labor from the [[Marble Cliff Quarry Co.]] at a construction cost of $1.34&nbsp;million and a total cost of $1.49&nbsp;million. The stadium's original capacity was 66,210. Upon completion, it was the largest poured concrete structure in the world. Many university officials feared that the stadium would never be filled to capacity.<ref name=ballparks/>\n\nSmith employed numerous revolutionary architectural techniques while building the stadium. At the base is a [[slurry wall]] to keep out the waters from the [[Olentangy River]]; the stadium rests on the flood plain. Instead of building a large bowl like the previously constructed [[Yale Bowl]], Ohio Stadium was designed to have an upper deck that would hang over part of the lower deck, giving Ohio Stadium its \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\" decks. Instead of employing numerous columns like those at [[Harvard Stadium]], Smith designed double columns that allow for more space between columns. The rotunda at the north end of the stadium, which is now adorned with stained glass murals of the offensive and defensive squads that comprise the Buckeye football team,<ref>{{cite press release|title=Motorists Insurance Gife Supports Ohio Stadium Enhancement and Renovation|publisher=Ohio State University|date=June 5, 2001|url=http://www.osu.edu/osu/newsrel/Archive/01-06-05_Ohio_Stadium_Art_Glass_Gift.html|accessdate=August 20, 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902170038/http://www.osu.edu/osu/newsrel/Archive/01-06-05_Ohio_Stadium_Art_Glass_Gift.html|archivedate=September 2, 2006}}</ref> was designed to look like the dome at the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome.\n\n==History==\nThe first game in the stadium was against [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] on October 7, 1922, and brought a crowd of around 25,000, which left people concerned because the stadium was half empty. This concern was put to rest at the stadium's formal dedication against Michigan on October 21, which the Wolverines won, 19&ndash;0. The crowd was announced at the game to be 72,000, but no one is really sure how many people made it into the stadium. This attendance mark was broken in a game against Michigan in 1926 when 90,411 came out to support the Buckeyes; this is also the last time standing-room-only tickets were sold for a game.<ref name=ballparks/>\n\nThe stadium did not regularly sell out until after World War II, and in the 1920s and 1930s most games only drew in 20,000 or 30,000 fans with many more attending the annual game against Michigan. The 1935 contest with [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] was a sellout, with over 81,000 in attendance.\n\nIn 1923, a cinder track was built around the football field, which would later be named after Olympian and Ohio State athlete [[Jesse Owens]]. The stadium was home to the OSU [[track and field]] teams until the opening of [[Jesse Owens Memorial Stadium]] in 2001.<ref name=ballparks/>\n\n===Renovations===\nAs time passed, minor adjustments raised the [[seating capacity]] to more than 90,000. In 1984, a new $2.1&nbsp;million scoreboard was installed. The stadium was heavily renovated from 1998 to 2001. The press box was replaced, additional seating was installed, and 81 luxury suites and 2,500 club seats were added. The south end zone scoreboard was also replaced by a {{convert|90|x|30|ft|adj=on}} video board that is able to show replays, highlights, animations, graphics and statistical information. Additionally, a smaller version of the south end scoreboard was added to the north end and a new LED ribbon board that runs end-zone to end-zone was added to the balcony prior to the 2009 season. In 1998, the track was removed and a {{convert|45|ft|m|sing=on}} [[slurry wall]] was built underneath the field to allow it to be lowered {{convert|14.5|ft|m}}, which places it below the water table. After the 1999 season, the field of play was lowered to add seating closer to the field.<ref>{{cite web |title=Part 2: Stadium Renovation 1998-2000 |url=http://buckeyeturf.osu.edu/index.php?option=com_content&id=907:part-2stadium-renovation-1998-2000&Itemid=170 |author=Sherratt, Pam |work=Buckeye Turf |publisher=[[The Ohio State University]] |accessdate=January 10, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110212219/http://buckeyeturf.osu.edu/index.php?option=com_content&id=907:part-2stadium-renovation-1998-2000&Itemid=170 |archive-date=January 10, 2015 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The temporary bleachers in the south end zone were replaced with permanent seating.

The result of the $194&nbsp;million renovation was a capacity that rose to 101,568. 80% of the cost of the renovation was funded by the sale of leases on the suites and club seats, with the remaining 20% funded by donations and the sale of naming rights for portions of the stadium. No public or university money was spent in the renovation process.<ref name=ballparks/>\n\nIn 1971, the natural grass field was removed, and [[AstroTurf]] was installed, compliments of a donation by Lou Fisher in dedication to fellow football player Joseph Campanella. A plaque was placed on the southeast corner in memory of Campanella. In 1979, the surface was replaced with SuperTurf. In 1990, natural grass made its return to the Horseshoe, in the form of a special grass called \"Prescription Athletic Turf.\" New field designs were put in place for the 1992 season and existed through the 2006 season. During the 2006 season, problems with the natural grass began to arise. After serious damage to the field during use in the spring of 2006, the field never recovered and had to be re-sodded. That grass never took root because of bad weather, and the university was forced to re-sod the field again only three weeks after the old sod was laid. The university spent approximately $150,000 to perform both soddings. In response to this, OSU replaced the natural grass with [[FieldTurf]] for the 2007 season. This new artificial turf looks and feels like real grass but requires minimal upkeep.\n\nIn March 2012 the university announced a $7&nbsp;million renovation to the scoreboard installed during the 2000\u201301 renovation. The project began April 23 and was completed in time for the 2012 season opener on September 1. The current scoreboard includes a Panasonic HD screen, stretching {{convert|124|by|42|ft}}, and incorporates upgrades to the audio system and the [[LED]] running boards (which are the smaller screens underneath the larger screen that usually display score updates and advertisements). A Pro Sound audio system with 25 different speakers flank the scoreboard. Older speakers throughout the Horseshoe received improvements and will eventually be replaced by new speakers fitted into the existing framework.\n\nPrior to the 2014 season, 2,500 seats were added to the south stands. These seats were built over the entrance tunnels and raised the official capacity of the stadium to 104,851, making it the third largest stadium in the country and the fourth largest stadium in the world. The renovations also included permanent lights added to the northeast and southeast corners of the stadium, as well as atop the press box, and the playing surface was replaced.<ref name=ballparks/><ref name=archivesB>{{cite web |title=2014 Ohio Stadium Renovations |work=Scribd. |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/146179633/Ohio-Stadium |accessdate=June 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611011432/http://www.scribd.com/doc/146179633/Ohio-Stadium |archive-date=June 11, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>[[File:Panoramic view of Ohio Stadium.jpg|thumb|right|Panoramic view.|500px]]\n\n=== Timeline of seating capacity<ref>[http://www.ohiostatebuckeyes.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=17300&KEY=&ATCLID=925256 Ohio Stadium - The Ohio State Buckeyes Official Athletics Site - OhioStateBuckeyes.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725033140/http://www.ohiostatebuckeyes.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=17300&KEY=&ATCLID=925256|date=2011-07-25}}</ref> ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}}\"|Capacity\n!style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}}\"|Years\n|-\n|66,210\n|1922\u20131943\n|-\n|72,754\n|1944\u20131947\n|-\n|78,677\n|1948\u20131957\n|-\n|79,658\n|1958\u20131960\n|-\n|79,727\n|1961\n|-\n|81,109\n|1962\u20131968\n|-\n|81,455\n|1969\u20131970\n|-\n|81,475\n|1971\n|-\n|81,667\n|1972\n|-\n|82,567\n|1973\n|-\n|83,080\n|1974\n|-\n|83,112\n|1975\u20131981\n|-\n|85,290\n|1982\u20131984\n|-\n|85,399\n|1985\u20131988\n|-\n|86,071\n|1989\u20131990\n|-\n|91,470\n|1991\u20131994\n|-\n|89,841\n|1995\u20131999\n|-\n|95,346\n|2000\n|-\n|101,568\n|2001\u20132006\n|-\n|102,329\n|2007\u20132014\n|-\n|104,944\n|2014\u20132017\n|-\n|102,082\n|2018\n|-\n|102,780\n|2019\n|}\n\n===Night football games===\nBefore the 2014 renovations, Ohio Stadium did not have permanent lights at the stadium, thus night games were rare. Ohio State's first night game in the stadium was played on September 14, 1985, when the #9 Buckeyes defeated the [[1985 Pittsburgh Panthers football team|Pittsburgh Panthers]], 10\u20137. Ohio State did not play another night game at Ohio Stadium until September 11, 1993, when the 16th-ranked Buckeyes defeated #12 [[1993 Washington Huskies football team|Washington]] 21\u201312. Ohio State played a total of 12 more night games before permanent lighting was installed, nine of which were against ranked opponents. The Buckeyes are 16-5 (.762) overall and 9-1 (.900) in the Big Ten in night games through September 18, 2017. Ohio State's most recent night game was a 34\u201310 win versus Michigan State on October 5th, 2019.\n\nBelow is a table of teams the Buckeyes have faced in multiple night games at Ohio Stadium.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}};\"|Matchups!!style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}};\"|Opponent!!style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}};\"|OSU Record\n|-\n|3||Penn State||2-1\n|-\n|2\n|Nebraska\n|2-0\n|-\n|2||Washington||2-0\n|-\n|2||Wisconsin||2-0\n|}\n\n===Largest attendance===\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}};\"|Rank !! style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}};\"|Date !! style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}};\"|Attendance !! style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}};\"|Result\n|-\n| 1 || November 26, 2016 || 110,045 || #2 Ohio State 30 \u2013 #3 Michigan 27 (2 OT)\n|-\n|2\n|October 28, 2017\n|109,302\n|#6 Ohio State 39 - #2 Penn State 38\n|-\n|3\n|September 9, 2017\n|109,088\n|#5 Oklahoma 31 \u2013 #2 Ohio State 16\n|-\n|4|| November 21, 2015 || 108,975 || #9 Michigan State 17 \u2013 #3 Ohio State 14\n|-\n|5||November 5, 2016||108,750|| #6 Ohio State 62 \u2013 #10 Nebraska 3\n|-\n|6|| November 29, 2014 || 108,610 || #6 Ohio State 42 \u2013 Michigan 28\n|-\n|7|| October 17, 2015 || 108,423 || #1 Ohio State 38 \u2013 Penn State 10\n|-\n|8|| September 16, 2017 || 108,414 || #8 Ohio State 38 \u2013 Army 7\n|-\n|9\n|September 27, 2014\n|108,362<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/boxscore?gameId=400547674|title=Barrett, Elliott lead Buckeyes by Bearcats, 50-28|date=September 27, 2014|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=September 27, 2014|agency=Associated Press|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140929012452/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/boxscore?gameId=400547674|archive-date=September 29, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n|#22 Ohio State 50 \u2013 Cincinnati 28\n|-\n|10|| November 7, 2015 || 108,075<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohiostatebuckeyes.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/110815aab.html|title=Ohio State Postgame Notes|website=www.ohiostatebuckeyes.com|accessdate=2015-11-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304190842/http://www.ohiostatebuckeyes.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/110815aab.html|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=live}}</ref> || #3 Ohio State 28 \u2013 Minnesota 14\n|}\n\n==Buckeye football==\n[[File:Script Ohio.jpg|thumb|250px|Script Ohio]]\nThe largest crowd in stadium history is 110,045, set November 26, 2016, in a game against Michigan.

A memorial to the last Native American chieftain of the Long Beach peninsula sits just to the right of the entrance, and a wooden sign with a marble headstone honors the unknown sailors lost at sea with the beginning of Revelations 20:13, \"And the sea gave up the dead\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitlongbeachpeninsula.com/oysterville-walking-tour/|title=Oysterville Walking Tour|access-date=19 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe original acre territory of the Oysterville cemetery was originally purchased from F.C. Davis in 1890 for $100 by the Oysterville Cemetery Association. However, the land had been used as the town's burial ground for over 30 years at that point.<ref name = Oysterville>{{citation| first= Marie|last=Oesting|title= Oysterville Cemetery Sketches| year=1988| publisher= Cole}}</ref> This territory was later expanded in 1979 by a half-acre donation from the Espy family, and now houses the new section of the cemetery.<ref name= Oysterville />\nThe earliest death date in the cemetery is 1951, three years before the town of Oysterville was founded. This grave belongs to John Carruthers, who was not originally buried in the cemetery, but transferred there by his brother Roberts so he could be buried with his father, mother, and brother.<ref name= Oysterville /> \nThe cemetery is located near a Native American burial ground, and though there is a grave for Chief Nahcati of the Chinook, located in the northwest corner of the cemetery, it is thought that he is actually buried farther west on Bud Goulter's farm.<ref name= Oysterville /> There is also record of the last Native American princess of the area, Myrtle Jane Johnson Woodcock, being buried in plot 67.<ref>{{cite web|first=T|last=Sheldon|title=Oysterville Cemetery; Pacific County, Washington|year=2003|url=http://www.interment.net/data/us/wa/pacific/oysterville/index.htm|access-date=21 February 2020}}</ref> She was the great granddaughter of chief Uhlahnee of the Chinook band at Celilo Falls, and great granddaughter of Chief Hoqueem of the Quinault tribe.<ref name= Oysterville />\nThere is also a grave for John Douglas, the first American settler on Shoalwater bay, but it is uncertain if he is actually buried there.<ref name = Images/> The current graves of both John Douglas and Chief Nahcati were built by Boy Scout troop number 44 under the direction of Herman Eberhardt, whose grave is built in a matching style.<ref name= Oysterville />\n\n==Management==\nThe Oysterville Cemetery has been managed by the Oysterville Cemetery Association since 1890. The current Oysterville Cemetery Association Board of Trustees is comprised of Chester (Tucker) Wachsmuth, president; Charles Wachsmuth, vice president; Charlie Talbott, secretary/treasurer; and Gordon Andrews, trustee.<ref>{{cite| first = Tucker| last= Wachsmuth| title= Oysterville Cemetery Board| year = 2019}}</ref> The transfer of power to the current management occured on January 15, 2017.
