{"title_page": "Internet Protocol", "text_new": "{{short description|Communication protocol that establishes the Internet across computer network boundaries}}\n{{IPstack}}\nThe '''Internet Protocol''' ('''IP''') is the principal [[communications protocol]] in the [[Internet protocol suite]] for relaying [[datagram]]s across network boundaries. Its [[routing]] function enables [[internetworking]], and essentially establishes the [[Internet]].\n\nIP has the task of delivering [[Packet (information technology)|packets]] from the source [[Host (network)|host]] to the destination host solely based on the [[IP address]]es in the packet [[Header (computing)|headers]]. For this purpose, IP defines packet structures that [[encapsulation (networking)|encapsulate]] the data to be delivered.  It also defines addressing methods that are used to label the datagram with source and destination information.\n\nHistorically, IP was the [[Connectionless communication|connectionless]] datagram service in the original [[Transmission Control Program]] introduced by [[Vint Cerf]] and [[Bob Kahn]] in 1974, which was complemented by a connection-oriented service that became the basis for the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP). The Internet protocol suite is therefore often referred to as ''TCP/IP''.\n\nThe first major version of IP, [[IPv4|Internet Protocol Version 4]] (IPv4), is the dominant protocol of the Internet. Its successor is [[IPv6|Internet Protocol Version 6]] (IPv6), which has been in increasing [[IPv6 deployment|deployment]] on the public Internet since c. 2006.\n\n==Function==\n[[File:UDP encapsulation.svg|thumb|260px|Sample encapsulation of application data from [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] to a Link protocol frame]]\nThe Internet Protocol is responsible for addressing [[host interface]]s, encapsulating data into datagrams (including [[IP fragmentation|fragmentation and reassembly]]) and routing datagrams from a source host interface to a destination host interface across one or more IP networks.'''<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_IPFunctions.htm |title=The TCP/IP Guide |author=Charles M. Kozierok}}</ref>''' For these purposes, the Internet Protocol defines the format of packets and provides an addressing system.\n\nEach datagram has two components: a [[Header (computing)|header]] and a [[Payload (computing)|payload]].  The [[IP header]] includes source IP address, destination IP address, and other metadata needed to route and deliver the datagram.  The payload is the data that is transported.  This method of nesting the data payload in a packet with a header is called encapsulation.\n\nIP addressing entails the assignment of IP addresses and associated parameters to host interfaces.  The address space is divided into [[subnetwork]]s, involving the designation of network prefixes. IP routing is performed by all hosts, as well as [[Router (computing)|routers]], whose main function is to transport packets across network boundaries.  Routers communicate with one another via specially designed [[routing protocol]]s, either [[interior gateway protocol]]s or [[exterior gateway protocol]]s, as needed for the topology of the network.\n\n==Version history==\n[[File:First Internet Demonstration, 1977.jpg|thumb|right|First Internet demonstration, linking the [[ARPANET]], [[PRNET]], and [[SATNET]] on November 22, 1977]]\nIn May 1974, the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) published a paper entitled \"A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cerf|first=V.|last2=Kahn|first2=R.|date=1974|title=A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication|url=https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall06/cos561/papers/cerf74.pdf|journal=IEEE Transactions on Communications|volume=22|issue=5|pages=637\u2013648|doi=10.1109/TCOM.1974.1092259|issn=1558-0857|quote=The authors wish to thank a number of colleagues for helpful comments during early discussions of international network protocols, especially R.

Crocker who commented on the creation and destruction of associations.|via=}}</ref> The paper's authors, [[Vint Cerf]] and [[Bob Kahn]], described an [[internetworking]] protocol for sharing resources using [[packet switching]] among [[network node]]s. A central control component of this model was the \"Transmission Control Program\" that incorporated both connection-oriented links and datagram services between hosts. The monolithic Transmission Control Program was later divided into a modular architecture consisting of the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] and [[User Datagram Protocol]] at the [[transport layer]] and the Internet Protocol at the [[internet layer]]. The model became known as the ''Department of Defense (DoD) Internet Model'' and ''[[Internet protocol suite]]'', and informally as ''TCP/IP''.\n\nIP versions 0 to 3 were experimental versions, used between 1973 and 1978.<ref name=\"Coty\">{{cite web |url=https://blog.alertlogic.com/blog/where-is-ipv1,-2,-3,and-5/ |title=Where is IPv1, 2, 3,and 5? |author=Stephen Coty |date=2011-02-11}}</ref> The following [[Internet Experiment Note]] (IEN) documents describe versions of the Internet Protocol prior to the modern version of IPv4:\n* [http://www.rfc-editor.org/ien/ien2.txt IEN 2] (''Comments on Internet Protocol and TCP''), dated August 1977 describes the need to separate the TCP and Internet Protocol functionalities (which were previously combined.)

Its most prominent difference from version 4 is the size of the addresses. While IPv4 uses [[32-bit|32 bits]] for addressing, yielding c. 4.3 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] ({{val|4.3|e=9}}) addresses, IPv6 uses [[128-bit]] addresses providing ca. {{val|3.4|e=38}} addresses.

Under the end-to-end principle, the network infrastructure is considered inherently unreliable at any single network element or transmission medium and is dynamic in terms of the availability of links and nodes. No central monitoring or performance measurement facility exists that tracks or maintains the state of the network. For the benefit of reducing [[network complexity]], the intelligence in the network is purposely located in the [[end node]]s.\n\nAs a consequence of this design, the Internet Protocol only provides [[best-effort delivery]] and its service is characterized as [[Reliability (computer networking)|unreliable]]. In network architectural language, it is a [[connectionless protocol]], in contrast to [[connection-oriented communication]]. Various error conditions may occur, such as [[data corruption]], [[packet loss]] and duplication. Because routing is dynamic, meaning every packet is treated independently, and because the network maintains no state based on the path of prior packets, different packets may be routed to the same destination via different paths, resulting in [[out-of-order delivery]] to the receiver.\n\nAll error conditions in the network must be detected and compensated by the participating end nodes. The [[upper layer protocol]]s of the Internet protocol suite are responsible for resolving reliability issues. For example, a host may [[Data buffer|buffer]] network data to ensure correct ordering before the data is delivered to an application.\n\nIPv4 provides safeguards to ensure that the header of an IP packet is error-free. A routing node discards packets that fail a header [[checksum]] test. Although the [[Internet Control Message Protocol]] (ICMP) provides notification of errors, a routing node is not required to notify either end node of errors. IPv6, by contrast, operates without header checksums, since current [[link layer]] technology is assumed to provide sufficient error detection.<ref>{{IETF RFC|1726}} section 6.2</ref><ref>{{IETF RFC|2460}}</ref>\n\n==Link capacity and capability==\nThe dynamic nature of the Internet and the diversity of its components provide no guarantee that any particular path is actually capable of, or suitable for, performing the data transmission requested. One of the technical constraints is the size of data packets allowed on a given link. Facilities exist to examine the [[maximum transmission unit]] (MTU) size of the local link and [[Path MTU Discovery]] can be used for the entire intended path to the destination.\n\nThe IPv4 internetworking layer has the ability to automatically [[IP fragmentation|fragment]] the original datagram into smaller units for transmission. In this case, IP provides re-ordering of fragments delivered out of order.<ref>Siyan, Karanjit. ''Inside TCP/IP'', New Riders Publishing, 1997. {{ISBN|1-56205-714-6}}</ref> An IPv6 network does not perform fragmentation or reassembly, and as per the [[end-to-end principle]], requires end stations and higher-layer protocols to avoid exceeding the network's MTU.<ref>{{cite web |title=IPv6 Fragmentation |author=Bill Cerveny |publisher=[[Arbor Networks]] |url=https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/ipv6-fragmentation/ |date=2011-07-25 |access-date=2016-09-10}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) is an example of a protocol that adjusts its segment size to be smaller than the MTU. The [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) and ICMP disregard MTU size, thereby forcing IP to fragment oversized datagrams.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/basic-journey-packet|title = Basic Journey of a Packet|date = 2 November 2010|accessdate = 4 May 2014|website = symantec.com|publisher = [[NortonLifeLock|Symantec]]|last = Parker|first = Don}}</ref>\n\n==Security==\nDuring the design phase of the ARPANET and the early Internet, the security aspects and needs of a public, international network could not be adequately anticipated.

Its [[routing]] function enables [[internetworking]], and essentially establishes the [[Internet]].\n\nIP has the task of delivering [[Packet (information technology)|packets]] from the source [[Host (network)|host]] to the destination host solely based on the [[IP address]]es in the packet [[Header (computing)|headers]]. For this purpose, IP defines packet structures that [[encapsulation (networking)|encapsulate]] the data to be delivered.  It also defines addressing methods that are used to label the datagram with source and destination information.\n\nHistorically, IP was the [[Connectionless communication|connectionless]] datagram service in the original [[Transmission Control Program]] introduced by [[Vint Cerf]] and [[Bob Kahn]] in 1974, which was complemented by a connection-oriented service that became the basis for the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP). The Internet protocol suite is therefore often referred to as ''TCP/IP''.\n\nThe first major version of IP, [[IPv4|Internet Protocol Version 4]] (IPv4), is the dominant protocol of the Internet. Its successor is [[IPv6|Internet Protocol Version 6]] (IPv6), which has been in increasing [[IPv6 deployment|deployment]] on the public Internet since c. 2006.\n\n==Function==\n[[File:UDP encapsulation.svg|thumb|260px|Sample encapsulation of application data from [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] to a Link protocol frame]]\nThe Internet Protocol is responsible for addressing [[host interface]]s, encapsulating data into datagrams (including [[IP fragmentation|fragmentation and reassembly]]) and routing datagrams from a source host interface to a destination host interface across one or more IP networks.'''<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_IPFunctions.htm |title=The TCP/IP Guide |author=Charles M. Kozierok}}</ref>''' For these purposes, the Internet Protocol defines the format of packets and provides an addressing system.\n\nEach datagram has two components: a [[Header (computing)|header]] and a [[Payload (computing)|payload]].  The [[IP header]] includes source IP address, destination IP address, and other metadata needed to route and deliver the datagram.  The payload is the data that is transported.  This method of nesting the data payload in a packet with a header is called encapsulation.\n\nIP addressing entails the assignment of IP addresses and associated parameters to host interfaces.  The address space is divided into [[subnetwork]]s, involving the designation of network prefixes. IP routing is performed by all hosts, as well as [[Router (computing)|routers]], whose main function is to transport packets across network boundaries.  Routers communicate with one another via specially designed [[routing protocol]]s, either [[interior gateway protocol]]s or [[exterior gateway protocol]]s, as needed for the topology of the network.\n\n==Version history==\n[[File:First Internet Demonstration, 1977.jpg|thumb|right|First Internet demonstration, linking the [[ARPANET]], [[PRNET]], and [[SATNET]] on November 22, 1977]]\nIn May 1974, the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) published a paper entitled \"A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cerf|first=V.|last2=Kahn|first2=R.|date=1974|title=A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication|url=https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall06/cos561/papers/cerf74.pdf|journal=IEEE Transactions on Communications|volume=22|issue=5|pages=637\u2013648|doi=10.1109/TCOM.1974.1092259|issn=1558-0857|quote=The authors wish to thank a number of colleagues for helpful comments during early discussions of international network protocols, especially R.

A central control component of this model was the \"Transmission Control Program\" that incorporated both connection-oriented links and datagram services between hosts. The monolithic Transmission Control Program was later divided into a modular architecture consisting of the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] and [[User Datagram Protocol]] at the [[transport layer]] and the Internet Protocol at the [[internet layer]]. The model became known as the ''Department of Defense (DoD) Internet Model'' and ''[[Internet protocol suite]]'', and informally as ''TCP/IP''.\n\nIP versions 0 to 3 were experimental versions, used between 1973 and 1978.<ref name=\"Coty\">{{cite web |url=https://blog.alertlogic.com/blog/where-is-ipv1,-2,-3,and-5/ |title=Where is IPv1, 2, 3,and 5? |author=Stephen Coty |date=2011-02-11}}</ref> The following [[Internet Experiment Note]] (IEN) documents describe versions of the Internet Protocol prior to the modern version of IPv4:\n* [http://www.rfc-editor.org/ien/ien2.txt IEN 2] (''Comments on Internet Protocol and TCP''), dated August 1977 describes the need to separate the TCP and Internet Protocol functionalities (which were previously combined.)  It proposes the first version of the IP header, using 0 for the version field.\n* [http://www.rfc-editor.org/ien/ien26.pdf IEN 26] (''A Proposed New Internet Header Format''), dated February 1978 describes a version of the IP header that uses a 1-bit version field.\n* [http://www.rfc-editor.org/ien/ien28.pdf IEN 28] (''Draft Internetwork Protocol Description Version 2''), dated February 1978 describes IPv2.\n* [http://www.rfc-editor.org/ien/ien41.pdf IEN 41] (''Internetwork Protocol Specification Version 4''), dated June 1978 describes the first protocol to be called IPv4.  The IP header is different from the modern IPv4 header.\n* [http://www.rfc-editor.org/ien/ien44.pdf IEN 44] (''Latest Header Formats''), dated June 1978 describes another version of IPv4, also with a header different from the modern IPv4 header.\n* [http://www.rfc-editor.org/ien/ien54.pdf IEN 54] (''Internetwork Protocol Specification Version 4''), dated September 1978 is the first description of IPv4 using the header that would be standardized in {{IETF RFC|760}}.\n\nThe dominant internetworking protocol in the [[Internet Layer]] in use is [[IPv4]]; the number 4 is the protocol version number carried in every IP datagram. IPv4 is described in {{IETF RFC|791}} (1981).\n\nVersion number 5 was used by the [[Internet Stream Protocol]], an experimental streaming protocol.<ref name=\"Coty\"/>\n\nThe successor to IPv4 is [[IPv6]]. IPv6 was a result of several years of experimentation and dialog during which various protocol models were proposed, such as TP/IX ({{IETF RFC|1475}}), PIP ({{IETF RFC|1621}}) and TUBA (TCP and UDP with Bigger Addresses, {{IETF RFC|1347}}). Its most prominent difference from version 4 is the size of the addresses. While IPv4 uses [[32-bit|32 bits]] for addressing, yielding c. 4.3 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] ({{val|4.3|e=9}}) addresses, IPv6 uses [[128-bit]] addresses providing ca. 340 [[undecillion]], or {{val|3.4|e=38}} addresses.

Under the end-to-end principle, the network infrastructure is considered inherently unreliable at any single network element or transmission medium and is dynamic in terms of the availability of links and nodes. No central monitoring or performance measurement facility exists that tracks or maintains the state of the network. For the benefit of reducing [[network complexity]], the intelligence in the network is purposely located in the [[end node]]s.\n\nAs a consequence of this design, the Internet Protocol only provides [[best-effort delivery]] and its service is characterized as [[Reliability (computer networking)|unreliable]]. In network architectural language, it is a [[connectionless protocol]], in contrast to [[connection-oriented communication]]. Various error conditions may occur, such as [[data corruption]], [[packet loss]] and duplication. Because routing is dynamic, meaning every packet is treated independently, and because the network maintains no state based on the path of prior packets, different packets may be routed to the same destination via different paths, resulting in [[out-of-order delivery]] to the receiver.\n\nAll error conditions in the network must be detected and compensated by the participating end nodes. The [[upper layer protocol]]s of the Internet protocol suite are responsible for resolving reliability issues. For example, a host may [[Data buffer|buffer]] network data to ensure correct ordering before the data is delivered to an application.\n\nIPv4 provides safeguards to ensure that the header of an IP packet is error-free. A routing node discards packets that fail a header [[checksum]] test. Although the [[Internet Control Message Protocol]] (ICMP) provides notification of errors, a routing node is not required to notify either end node of errors. IPv6, by contrast, operates without header checksums, since current [[link layer]] technology is assumed to provide sufficient error detection.<ref>{{IETF RFC|1726}} section 6.2</ref><ref>{{IETF RFC|2460}}</ref>\n\n==Link capacity and capability==\nThe dynamic nature of the Internet and the diversity of its components provide no guarantee that any particular path is actually capable of, or suitable for, performing the data transmission requested. One of the technical constraints is the size of data packets allowed on a given link. Facilities exist to examine the [[maximum transmission unit]] (MTU) size of the local link and [[Path MTU Discovery]] can be used for the entire intended path to the destination.\n\nThe IPv4 internetworking layer has the ability to automatically [[IP fragmentation|fragment]] the original datagram into smaller units for transmission. In this case, IP provides re-ordering of fragments delivered out of order.<ref>Siyan, Karanjit. ''Inside TCP/IP'', New Riders Publishing, 1997. {{ISBN|1-56205-714-6}}</ref> An IPv6 network does not perform fragmentation or reassembly, and as per the [[end-to-end principle]], requires end stations and higher-layer protocols to avoid exceeding the network's MTU.<ref>{{cite web |title=IPv6 Fragmentation |author=Bill Cerveny |publisher=[[Arbor Networks]] |url=https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/ipv6-fragmentation/ |date=2011-07-25 |access-date=2016-09-10}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) is an example of a protocol that adjusts its segment size to be smaller than the MTU. The [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) and ICMP disregard MTU size, thereby forcing IP to fragment oversized datagrams.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/basic-journey-packet|title = Basic Journey of a Packet|date = 2 November 2010|accessdate = 4 May 2014|website = symantec.com|publisher = [[NortonLifeLock|Symantec]]|last = Parker|first = Don}}</ref>\n\n==Security==\nDuring the design phase of the ARPANET and the early Internet, the security aspects and needs of a public, international network could not be adequately anticipated.

Recording sessions for the album took place at several locations in both the United Kingdom and North America from January to August 1969. The album's production was credited to the band's lead guitarist and songwriter [[Jimmy Page]], and it was also Led Zeppelin's first album on which [[Eddie Kramer]] served as engineer.\n\nThe album exhibited the band's evolving musical style of blues-derived material and their guitar [[riff]]-based sound. It has been described as the band's heaviest album.{{sfn|Buckley|2003|p=502}}  Six of the nine songs were written by the band, while the other three were reinterpretations of [[Chicago blues]] songs by [[Willie Dixon]] and [[Howlin' Wolf]]. One single, \"[[Whole Lotta Love]]\", was released outside of the UK (the band would release no UK singles during their career)<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schinder|first=Scott|title=Icons of Rock: An Encyclopedia of the Legends Who Changed Music Forever|publisher=Greenwood|year=2007|isbn=0313338477|location=|pages=380}}</ref>, and peaked as a top-ten single in over a dozen markets around the world.\n\n''Led Zeppelin II'' was a commercial success, and was the band's first album to reach number one on charts in the UK and the US. The album's cover designer David Juniper was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Recording Package]] in 1970. On 15 November 1999, the album was certified [[RIAA certification|12\u00d7 Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for sales passing 12 million copies. Since its release, various writers and music critics have regularly cited ''Led Zeppelin II'' as one of the greatest and most influential albums of all time.<ref name=\"acclaimed\" />\n\n==Background==\n''Led Zeppelin II'' was conceived during a busy period of Led Zeppelin's career from January through August 1969, when they completed four European and three American [[Led Zeppelin concert tour chronology|concert tours]].{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=118}} Each song was separately recorded, mixed and produced at various studios in the UK and North America.

The lyrics were taken directly from [[Willie Dixon]]'s \"[[You Need Love (Muddy Waters song)|You Need Love]]\", which led to the group being sued for plagiarism, eventually settling out of court. The arrangement also resembles the [[Small Faces]] track \"[[You Need Loving]]\".{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=47}}{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=57}} With basic tracks recorded on Page's houseboat, the middle section of the song contained a variety of overdubbed instruments and vocals which were mixed live by Page and Kramer, making full use of stereo panning and other controls available on the desk. The song was edited down to a single in the US, where it became a top 5 hit. In the UK, a single release was cancelled; the group never issued any singles there during their active career together.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=47\u201348}} It was finally issued as a single in 1997.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=59}} The song was subsequently re-recorded by the [[Collective Consciousness Society]]; this version became the theme tune to the BBC TV show ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', which ensured it would be well-known by everyone in Britain.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=48}}\n\nLed Zeppelin performed \"Whole Lotta Love\" at every gig from June 1969 onwards. It was the closing number of their live shows between 1970 and 1973, often extended to form a rock'n'roll medley towards the end of the set. A different arrangement of the song was played for the Knebworth Fayre concerts in 1979. It was the last song the group ever performed live with Bonham, on 7 July 1980. \"Whole Lotta Love\" has since been critically praised as one of the definitive heavy metal tracks, though the group have never considered themselves to fit that specific style.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=48}}\n\n\"[[What Is and What Should Never Be]]\" was primarily written by Plant. It features a variety of dynamics during the track, along with flanged vocals and wide-panned stereo guitars.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=48}}\n\n\"[[The Lemon Song]]\" was a re-arrangement of [[Howlin' Wolf]]'s \"[[Killing Floor (Howlin' Wolf song)|Killing Floor]]\", which had become a regular part of the group's live show during 1969. It was mostly recorded live and expanded to include new lyrics, including the sexually-charged phrase \"squeeze my lemon\" which was borrowed from [[Robert Johnson]]'s \"[[Travelling Riverside Blues]]\", which the band had played for the BBC radio show ''[[Top Gear (radio show)|Top Gear]]'' broadcast on 29 June 1969.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=48}}<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=z_dmDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA46#v=onepage&q&f=false |pages=46\u201347 |title=Led Zeppelin: All the Albums, All the Songs |author=Martin Popoff |publisher=Voyageur Press |date=21 August 2018|isbn=9780760363775 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AQLtgOAQcqQC&pg=PT102#v=onepage&q&f=false |page=102 |title=Led Zeppelin: The Complete Guide To Their Music |author=Dave Lewis |publisher=Omnibus Press |date= 7 January 2010|isbn=9780857121356 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/jimmy-page-on-led-zeppelins-totally-fearless-bbc-sessions-110658/ |work=rollingstone.com |title=Jimmy Page on Led Zeppelin's 'Totally Fearless' BBC Sessions |author=David Fricke |date=13 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n\"[[Thank You (Led Zeppelin song)|Thank You]]\" was written by Plant as a love song to his wife, Maureen.

The group disliked the track, considering it to be little more than filler, and consequently it was never played live by the group. Plant performed the track live on his 1990 solo tour.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=48}}\n\n\"[[Ramble On]]\" was written by Plant. The lyrics were inspired by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], and similar themes appeared on subsequent Led Zeppelin albums. The track made good use of dynamics, moving from a quiet acoustic guitar in the opening, to a variety of overdubbed electric guitars towards the end.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=49}} It was never performed live by Led Zeppelin during their main career, but Plant has performed the song regularly on solo tours, and it was part of Page and Plant's live set in the mid-1990s. It was finally performed live for the first time by Led Zeppelin at the [[Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert]] in 2007.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=67}}\n\n\"[[Moby Dick (instrumental)|Moby Dick]]\" was designed as a showcase for Bonham's drum solo. It was originally called \"Pat's Delight\" (after his wife) and features a variety of drums and percussive instruments played with bare hands as well as drumsticks. It was a regular part of Led Zeppelin's live show, developing to include additional percussion and electronic drums.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=49}}\n\n\"[[Bring It On Home (Sonny Boy Williamson II song)#Led Zeppelin version|Bring It On Home]]\" was a cover of a Willie Dixon song originally performed by [[Sonny Boy Williamson II]]. Led Zeppelin's arrangement includes a faster middle section in addition to the straightforward blues structure of the original. It was played live regularly throughout late 1969 and 1970.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=49}}\n\n==Artwork==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2004-0430-501, Jagdstaffel 11, Manfred v.

The blonde-haired woman on the cover is French actress Delphine Seyrig in her role as Marie-Magdalene in the film ''[[:fr:Mister Freedom|Mister Freedom]]'', a leftist anti-war satire by William Klein (1969).

This song reached No. 4 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in January 1970, after Atlantic went against the group's wishes by releasing a shorter version on 45. The single's [[A-side and B-side|B-side]], \"[[Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman)]]\", also hit the ''Billboard'' chart, peaking at No. 65 in April 1970.

October 1969 in the United Kingdom by [[Atlantic Records]]. Recording sessions for the album took place at several locations in both the United Kingdom and North America from January to August 1969. The album's production was credited to the band's lead guitarist and songwriter [[Jimmy Page]], and it was also Led Zeppelin's first album on which [[Eddie Kramer]] served as engineer.\n\nThe album exhibited the band's evolving musical style of blues-derived material and their guitar [[riff]]-based sound. It has been described as the band's heaviest album.{{sfn|Buckley|2003|p=502}}  Six of the nine songs were written by the band, while the other three were reinterpretations of [[Chicago blues]] songs by [[Willie Dixon]] and [[Howlin' Wolf]]. One single, \"[[Whole Lotta Love]]\", was released outside of the UK (the band would release no UK singles during their career)<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schinder|first=Scott|title=Icons of Rock: An Encyclopedia of the Legends Who Changed Music Forever|publisher=Greenwood|year=2007|isbn=0313338477|location=|pages=380}}</ref>, and peaked as a top-ten single in over a dozen markets around the world.\n\n''Led Zeppelin II'' was a commercial success, and was the band's first album to reach number one on charts in the UK and the US. The album's cover designer David Juniper was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Recording Package]] in 1970. On 15 November 1999, the album was certified [[RIAA certification|12\u00d7 Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for sales passing 12 million copies. Since its release, various writers and music critics have regularly cited ''Led Zeppelin II'' as one of the greatest and most influential albums of all time.<ref name=\"acclaimed\" />\n\n==Background==\n''Led Zeppelin II'' was conceived during a busy period of Led Zeppelin's career from January through August 1969, when they completed four European and three American [[Led Zeppelin concert tour chronology|concert tours]].{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=118}} Each song was separately recorded, mixed and produced at various studios in the UK and North America. The album was written on tour, during periods of a couple of hours in between concerts, a studio was booked and the recording process begun, necessarily resulting in spontaneity and urgency, which is reflected in the sound.{{sfn|Rosen|1996|p=118}} Several songs resulted from improvisation while touring, including during the instrumental sections of \"[[Dazed and Confused (song)|Dazed and Confused]]\", and were recorded mostly live in the studio.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=15,46\u201347}}\n\nThe album used a wide variety of recording studios in the UK and the US.

The lyrics were taken directly from [[Willie Dixon]]'s \"[[You Need Love (Muddy Waters song)|You Need Love]]\", which led to the group being sued for plagiarism, eventually settling out of court. The arrangement also resembles the [[Small Faces]] track \"[[You Need Loving]]\".{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=47}}{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=57}} With basic tracks recorded on Page's houseboat, the middle section of the song contained a variety of overdubbed instruments and vocals which were mixed live by Page and Kramer, making full use of stereo panning and other controls available on the desk. The song was edited down to a single in the US, where it became a top 5 hit. In the UK, a single release was cancelled; the group never issued any singles there during their active career together.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=47\u201348}} It was finally issued as a single in 1997.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=59}} The song was subsequently re-recorded by the [[Collective Consciousness Society]]; this version became the theme tune to the BBC TV show ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', which ensured it would be well-known by everyone in Britain.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=48}}\n\nLed Zeppelin performed \"Whole Lotta Love\" at every gig from June 1969 onwards. It was the closing number of their live shows between 1970 and 1973, often extended to form a rock'n'roll medley towards the end of the set. A different arrangement of the song was played for the Knebworth Fayre concerts in 1979. It was the last song the group ever performed live with Bonham, on 7 July 1980. \"Whole Lotta Love\" has since been critically praised as one of the definitive heavy metal tracks, though the group have never considered themselves to fit that specific style.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=48}}\n\n\"[[What Is and What Should Never Be]]\" was primarily written by Plant. It features a variety of dynamics during the track, along with flanged vocals and wide-panned stereo guitars.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=48}}\n\n\"[[The Lemon Song]]\" was a re-arrangement of [[Howlin' Wolf]]'s \"[[Killing Floor (Howlin' Wolf song)|Killing Floor]]\", which had become a regular part of the group's live show during 1969. It was mostly recorded live and expanded to include new lyrics, including the sexually-charged phrase \"squeeze my lemon\" which was borrowed from [[Robert Johnson]]'s \"[[Travelling Riverside Blues]]\", which the band had played for the BBC radio show ''[[Top Gear (radio show)|Top Gear]]'' broadcast on 29 June 1969.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=48}}<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=z_dmDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA46#v=onepage&q&f=false |pages=46\u201347 |title=Led Zeppelin: All the Albums, All the Songs |author=Martin Popoff |publisher=Voyageur Press |date=21 August 2018|isbn=9780760363775 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AQLtgOAQcqQC&pg=PT102#v=onepage&q&f=false |page=102 |title=Led Zeppelin: The Complete Guide To Their Music |author=Dave Lewis |publisher=Omnibus Press |date= 7 January 2010|isbn=9780857121356 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/jimmy-page-on-led-zeppelins-totally-fearless-bbc-sessions-110658/ |work=rollingstone.com |title=Jimmy Page on Led Zeppelin's 'Totally Fearless' BBC Sessions |author=David Fricke |date=13 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n\"[[Thank You (Led Zeppelin song)|Thank You]]\" was written by Plant as a love song to his wife, Maureen. Page played [[twelve-string guitar]] and Jones played [[Hammond organ]] on the track.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=48}}\n\n===Side two===\n\"[[Heartbreaker (Led Zeppelin song)|Heartbreaker]]\" was mostly written by Page as a showcase for his guitar skills, including an unaccompanied solo in the middle of the song. It quickly became a live favourite, being performed regularly from October 1969 onwards, and throughout the group's career.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=48}}\n\n\"[[Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman)]]\" was purported to be written about a [[groupie]] the band encountered while touring the US. The group disliked the track, considering it to be little more than filler, and consequently it was never played live by the group. Plant performed the track live on his 1990 solo tour.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=48}}\n\n\"[[Ramble On]]\" was written by Plant. The lyrics were inspired by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], and similar themes appeared on subsequent Led Zeppelin albums. The track made good use of dynamics, moving from a quiet acoustic guitar in the opening, to a variety of overdubbed electric guitars towards the end.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=49}} It was never performed live by Led Zeppelin during their main career, but Plant has performed the song regularly on solo tours, and it was part of Page and Plant's live set in the mid-1990s. It was finally performed live for the first time by Led Zeppelin at the [[Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert]] in 2007.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=67}}\n\n\"[[Moby Dick (instrumental)|Moby Dick]]\" was designed as a showcase for Bonham's drum solo. It was originally called \"Pat's Delight\" (after his wife) and features a variety of drums and percussive instruments played with bare hands as well as drumsticks. It was a regular part of Led Zeppelin's live show, developing to include additional percussion and electronic drums.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=49}}\n\n\"[[Bring It On Home (Sonny Boy Williamson II song)#Led Zeppelin version|Bring It On Home]]\" was a cover of a Willie Dixon song originally performed by [[Sonny Boy Williamson II]]. Led Zeppelin's arrangement includes a faster middle section in addition to the straightforward blues structure of the original.

Juniper pasted the faces of the band on top of the original photograph, and added faces from a few other photographs as well. The blonde-haired woman on the cover is French actress Delphine Seyrig in her role as Marie-Magdalene in the film ''[[:fr:Mister Freedom|Mister Freedom]]'', a leftist anti-war satire by William Klein (1969).

Commercially, ''Led Zeppelin II'' was the band's first album to hit No. 1 in the US, knocking [[The Beatles]]' ''[[Abbey Road]]'' (1969) twice from the top spot, where it remained for seven weeks.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=47}} By April 1970 it had registered three million American sales, whilst in Britain it enjoyed a 138-week residence on the LP chart, climbing to the top spot in February 1970.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=47}} In November [[Ritchie Yorke]] reported in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' that while the album had achieved \"staggering\" sales, as a [[hard rock]] record it was considered unsuitable for North American [[Top 40]] radio stations, who were \"dreary and detached from the mainstream of contemporary rock music\".<ref>{{cite journal |first=Ritchie |last=Yorke |title=Maple Leaf Rock |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=14 November 1970 |volume=82 |issue=46 |page=R-16 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=sSkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PP18&dq=%22Led+Zeppelin+II%22 |issn=0006-2510}}</ref>\n\nThe album also yielded Led Zeppelin's biggest hit, \"[[Whole Lotta Love]]\". This song reached No. 4 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in January 1970, after Atlantic went against the group's wishes by releasing a shorter version on 45. The single's [[A-side and B-side|B-side]], \"[[Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman)]]\", also hit the ''Billboard'' chart, peaking at No. 65 in April 1970. The album helped establish Led Zeppelin as an international concert attraction, and for the next year, the group continued to tour relentlessly, initially performing in clubs and ballrooms, then in larger auditoriums and eventually stadiums as their popularity grew.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4739|pure_url=yes}} allmusic: Led Zeppelin&nbsp;\u2013 Bio].
