In English, the term \"First World War\" had been used by [[Charles \u00e0 Court Repington]], as a title for his memoirs (published in 1920); he had noted his discussion on the matter with a Major Johnstone of [[Harvard University]] in his diary entry of September 10, 1918.<ref>[http://qi.com/infocloud/the-first-world-war The First World War] Quite Interesting Ltd.

In the same article, on page 32, the term \"World War{{nbsp}}II\" was first used speculatively to describe the upcoming war.

(Polish time) Friday, September 1, when a German bombing plane dropped a projectile on Puck, fishing village and air base in the armpit of the Hel Peninsula.}}</ref> One week earlier, on September 4, the day after France and the United Kingdom declared war on Germany, the Danish newspaper ''[[Kristeligt Dagblad]]'' used the term on its front page, saying \"The Second World War broke out yesterday at 11 a.m.\"<ref>\"Den anden Verdenskrig udbr\u00f8d i Gaar Middags Kl. 11\", ''Kristeligt Dagblad'', September 4, 1939.</ref>\n\n[[Speculative fiction]] authors had been noting the concept of a Second World War in 1919 and 1920, when [[Milo Hastings]] wrote his [[dystopian]] novel, ''City of Endless Night''.\n\nOther languages have also adopted the \"world war\" terminology, for example; in [[French language|French]]: \"world war\" is translated as ''guerre mondiale'', in [[German language|German]]: ''Weltkrieg'' (which, prior to the war, had been used in the more abstract meaning of a global conflict), in [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''guerra mondiale'', in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''guerra mundial'', in [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''verdenskrig'', and in [[Russian language|Russian]]: ''\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0430'' (''mirovaya voyna''.)\n\n==First World War==\n{{main|World War I}}\nWorld War I occurred from 1914 to 1918. In terms of human [[history of technology|technological history]], the scale of World War{{nbsp}}I was enabled by the technological advances of the [[second industrial revolution]] and the resulting [[globalization]] that allowed global power projection and [[mass production]] of military hardware. It had been recognized that the complex system of opposing [[military alliance]]s (the [[German Empire|German]] and [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austro-Hungarian]] Empires against the [[British Empire|British]], [[Russian Empire|Russian]], and [[French colonial empire|French]] Empires) was likely to lead to a worldwide conflict if a war broke out. Due to this fact, a very minute conflict between two countries had the potential to set off a [[domino effect]] of alliances, triggering a world war. The fact that the powers involved had large [[colonial empire|overseas empires]] virtually guaranteed that such a war would be worldwide, as the colonies' resources would be a crucial strategic factor. The same strategic considerations also ensured that the combatants would strike at each other's colonies, thus spreading the wars far more widely than those of [[pre-Columbian]] times.\n\n[[War crimes]] were perpetrated in World War I. [[Chemical weapons in World War I|Chemical weapons]] were used in the First World War despite the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]] having outlawed the use of such weapons in warfare. The [[Ottoman Empire]] was responsible for the [[Armenian genocide]]\u2014the murder of more than 1,000,000 Armenians during the First World War\u2014and the other [[late Ottoman genocides]].\n\n==Second World War==\n{{main|World War II}}\nThe Second World War occurred from 1939 to 1945 and is the only conflict in which [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear weapons]] have been used. (won by the Germans) [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]], in [[Japanese Empire|Japan]], were [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|devastated]] by atomic bombs dropped by the United States. [[Nazi Germany]], led by [[Adolf Hitler]], was responsible for [[genocides]], most notably [[the Holocaust]], the killing of 6,000,000 [[Jews]] and 5,000,000 others persecuted by the [[Nazis]] including [[Romani people]] and [[homosexuals]]. The [[United States]], the [[Soviet Union]], and [[Canada]] deported and [[interned]] minority groups within their own borders, and largely because of the conflict, many ethnic [[Germans]] were later expelled from [[Eastern Europe]]. Japan was responsible for attacking [[neutrality (international relations)|neutral nations]] without a [[declaration of war]], such as the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|bombing of Pearl Harbor]]. It is also known for its brutal treatment and killing of Allied [[prisoners of war]] and the inhabitants of [[Asia]]. It also used Asians as [[forced labor]]ers and was responsible for the [[Nanking massacre]] where 250,000 civilians in the city were brutally murdered by Japanese troops. [[Non-combatants]] suffered at least as badly as or worse than [[combatants]], and the distinction between combatants and non-combatants was often blurred by belligerents of [[total war]] in both conflicts.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://storiespreschool.com/worldwar.html |title=World War |accessdate=11 November 2019}}</ref> \n\nThe outcome of World War II had a profound effect on the course of world history. The old European empires either collapsed or were dismantled as a direct result of the wars' crushing costs and, in some cases, their fall was due to the defeat of imperial powers. The United States became firmly established as the dominant global superpower, along with its ideological foe, the Soviet Union, in close competition. The two superpowers exerted political influence over most of the world's [[nation-states]] for decades after the end of the Second World War. The modern international security, economic, and diplomatic system was created in the aftermath of the wars.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://storiespreschool.com/worldwar.html |title=World War |accessdate=11 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nInstitutions such as the [[United Nations]] were established to collectivize international affairs, with the explicit goal of preventing another outbreak of general war. The wars had also greatly changed the course of daily life. Technologies developed during wartime had a profound effect on peacetime life as well, such as by advances in [[jet aircraft]], [[penicillin]], [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]], and [[electronic computers]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://storiespreschool.com/worldwar.html |title=World War |accessdate=11 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Third World War==\n{{main article|World War III}}\nSince the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] during the Second World War, there has been a widespread and prolonged fear of a potential Third World War between nuclear-armed powers.

In English, the term \"First World War\" had been used by [[Charles \u00e0 Court Repington]], as a title for his memoirs (published in 1920); he had noted his discussion on the matter with a Major Johnstone of [[Harvard University]] in his diary entry of September 10, 1918.<ref>[http://qi.com/infocloud/the-first-world-war The First World War] Quite Interesting Ltd. Encyclopedia. Downloaded Feb. 11, 2017</ref>\n\nThe term \"World War I\" was coined by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine on page 28b of its June 12, 1939 issue. In the same article, on page 32, the term \"World War{{nbsp}}II\" was first used speculatively to describe the upcoming war. The first use for the actual war came in its issue of September 11, 1939.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://time.com/3195322/world-war-grey-friday/ |title=Grey Friday: TIME Reports on World War II Beginning |work=TIME |date=September 11, 1939 |access-date=20 October 2014 |quote=World War II began last week at 5:20 a. m.

In terms of human [[history of technology|technological history]], the scale of World War{{nbsp}}I was enabled by the technological advances of the [[second industrial revolution]] and the resulting [[globalization]] that allowed global power projection and [[mass production]] of military hardware. It had been recognized that the complex system of opposing [[military alliance]]s (the [[German Empire|German]] and [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austro-Hungarian]] Empires against the [[British Empire|British]], [[Russian Empire|Russian]], and [[French colonial empire|French]] Empires) was likely to lead to a worldwide conflict if a war broke out. Due to this fact, a very minute conflict between two countries had the potential to set off a [[domino effect]] of alliances, triggering a world war. The fact that the powers involved had large [[colonial empire|overseas empires]] virtually guaranteed that such a war would be worldwide, as the colonies' resources would be a crucial strategic factor. The same strategic considerations also ensured that the combatants would strike at each other's colonies, thus spreading the wars far more widely than those of [[pre-Columbian]] times.\n\n[[War crimes]] were perpetrated in World War I. [[Chemical weapons in World War I|Chemical weapons]] were used in the First World War despite the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]] having outlawed the use of such weapons in warfare. The [[Ottoman Empire]] was responsible for the [[Armenian genocide]]\u2014the murder of more than 1,000,000 Armenians during the First World War\u2014and the other [[late Ottoman genocides]].\n\n==Second World War==\n{{main|World War II}}\nThe Second World War occurred from 1939 to 1945 and is the only conflict in which [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear weapons]] have been used. [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]], in [[Japanese Empire|Japan]], were [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|devastated]] by atomic bombs dropped by the United States. [[Nazi Germany]], led by [[Adolf Hitler]], was responsible for [[genocides]], most notably [[the Holocaust]], the killing of 6,000,000 [[Jews]] and 5,000,000 others persecuted by the [[Nazis]] including [[Romani people]] and [[homosexuals]]. The [[United States]], the [[Soviet Union]], and [[Canada]] deported and [[interned]] minority groups within their own borders, and largely because of the conflict, many ethnic [[Germans]] were later expelled from [[Eastern Europe]]. Japan was responsible for attacking [[neutrality (international relations)|neutral nations]] without a [[declaration of war]], such as the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|bombing of Pearl Harbor]]. It is also known for its brutal treatment and killing of Allied [[prisoners of war]] and the inhabitants of [[Asia]]. It also used Asians as [[forced labor]]ers and was responsible for the [[Nanking massacre]] where 250,000 civilians in the city were brutally murdered by Japanese troops. [[Non-combatants]] suffered at least as badly as or worse than [[combatants]], and the distinction between combatants and non-combatants was often blurred by belligerents of [[total war]] in both conflicts.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://storiespreschool.com/worldwar.html |title=World War |accessdate=11 November 2019}}</ref> \n\nThe outcome of World War II had a profound effect on the course of world history. The old European empires either collapsed or were dismantled as a direct result of the wars' crushing costs and, in some cases, their fall was due to the defeat of imperial powers. The United States became firmly established as the dominant global superpower, along with its ideological foe, the Soviet Union, in close competition. The two superpowers exerted political influence over most of the world's [[nation-states]] for decades after the end of the Second World War. The modern international security, economic, and diplomatic system was created in the aftermath of the wars.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://storiespreschool.com/worldwar.html |title=World War |accessdate=11 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nInstitutions such as the [[United Nations]] were established to collectivize international affairs, with the explicit goal of preventing another outbreak of general war. The wars had also greatly changed the course of daily life. Technologies developed during wartime had a profound effect on peacetime life as well, such as by advances in [[jet aircraft]], [[penicillin]], [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]], and [[electronic computers]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://storiespreschool.com/worldwar.html |title=World War |accessdate=11 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Third World War==\n{{main article|World War III}}\nSince the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] during the Second World War, there has been a widespread and prolonged fear of a potential Third World War between nuclear-armed powers.
