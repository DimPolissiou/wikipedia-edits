The money paid to Germany included a $270 million fine paid the year before (related to bribes in Nigeria<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7105582.stm |title=Nigeria probes Siemens bribe case}}</ref>).

Until 1999 in Germany, bribes were a tax-deductible business expense, and there were no penalties for bribing foreign officials.  In 1999 the [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention]] came into effect, to which Germany was a party, and Siemens started to use off-shore accounts and other means of hiding its bribery.\n\nAs the investigation opened a midlevel executive in the telecommunications unit, Reinhard Slekaczek, was identified as a key player; Slekaczek quit Siemens in 2005 after the company required him to sign a document saying he had followed law and company policy, and turned state's evidence and led investigators to documents he had saved and to other documents.  He had controlled an annual global bribery budget of $40 to $50 million.  The usual method of bribery was to pay a local insider as a \"contractor\" who would in turn pass money to government officials; as part of the settlement Siemens disclosed that it had 2,700 such contractors worldwide.  Bribes were generally around 5% of a contract's value but in very corrupt countries they could be as high as 40%.  It paid the highest bribes in Argentina, Israel, Venezuela, China, Nigeria, and Russia.<ref name=NYThow/>\n\nExamples of bribery the investigation found included:<ref name=NYThow/>\n* $40 million in bribes in Argentina to win a $1 billion contract to make national identity cards. \n* $20 million in Israel for a contract to build power plants\n* $16 million in Venezuela for urban rail lines. \n* $14 million In China for medical equipment\n* $12.7 million in payments in Nigeria\n* $5 million in Bangladesh for mobile phones\n* $1.7 million in Iraq to Saddam Hussein and others.\n\nThe investigation led directly to several prosecutions while it was unfolding, and led to settlements with other governments and prosecution of Siemens employees and bribe recipients in various countries.\n\nIn May 2007 a German court convicted two former executives of paying about \u20ac6 million in bribes from 1999 to 2002 to help Siemens win [[natural gas]] [[Gas turbine|turbine]] supply contracts with [[Enel]], an Italian energy company.

This was the largest bribery fine in history, at the time.  The money paid to Germany included a $270 million fine paid the year before (related to bribes in Nigeria<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7105582.stm |title=Nigeria probes Siemens bribe case}}</ref>).

Until 1999 in Germany, bribes were a tax-deductible business expense, and there were no penalties for bribing foreign officials.  In 1999 the [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention]] came into effect, to which Germany was a party, and Siemens started to use off-shore accounts and other means of hiding its bribery.\n\nAs the investigation opened a midlevel executive in the telecommunications unit, Reinhard Slekaczek, was identified as a key player; Slekaczek quit Siemens in 2005 after the company required him to sign a document saying he had followed law and company policy, and turned state's evidence and led investigators to documents he had saved and to other documents.  He had controlled an annual global bribery budget of $40 to $50 million.  The usual method of bribery was to pay a local insider as a \"contractor\" who would in turn pass money to government officials; as part of the settlement Siemens disclosed that it had 2,700 such contractors worldwide.  Bribes were generally around 5% of a contract's value but in very corrupt countries they could be as high as 40%.  It paid the highest bribes in Argentina, Israel, Venezuela, China, Nigeria, and Russia.<ref name=NYThow/>\n\nExamples of bribery the investigation found included:<ref name=NYThow/>\n* $40 million in bribes in Argentina to win a $1 billion contract to make national identity cards. \n* $20 million in Israel for a contract to build power plants\n* $16 million in Venezuela for urban rail lines. \n* $14 million In China for medical equipment\n* $12.7 million in payments in Nigeria\n* $5 million in Bangladesh for mobile phones\n* $1.7 million in Iraq to Saddam Hussein and others.\n\nThe investigation led directly to several prosecutions while it was unfolding, and led to settlements with other governments and prosecution of Siemens employees and bribe recipients in various countries.\n\nIn May 2007 a German court convicted two former executives of paying about \u20ac6 million in bribes from 1999 to 2002 to help Siemens win [[natural gas]] [[Gas turbine|turbine]] supply contracts with [[Enel]], an Italian energy company.
