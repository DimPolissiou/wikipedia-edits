It is a form of [[extractive metallurgy]]. It is used to extract many metals from their ores, including [[Silver mining#Ore processing|silver]], [[iron-making|iron]], [[copper extraction|copper]], and other [[base metals]]. Smelting uses heat and a chemical [[reducing agent]] to decompose the ore, driving off other elements as gases or [[slag]] and leaving the metal base behind. The reducing agent is commonly a source of [[carbon]], such as [[coke (fuel)|coke]]\u2014or, in earlier times, [[charcoal]].<ref name=SmeltingEB>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Smelting |url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/smelting |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica |accessdate=2018-08-15}}</ref>\n\nThe carbon (or carbon monoxide derived from it) removes [[oxygen]] from the ore, leaving the elemental metal. The carbon thus oxidizes in two stages, producing first [[carbon monoxide]] and then [[carbon dioxide]]. As most ores are impure, it is often necessary to use [[Flux (metallurgy)|flux]], such as [[limestone]], to remove the accompanying rock [[gangue]] as slag.\n\nPlants for the [[electrolysis|electrolytic]] reduction of [[aluminium]] are also generally referred to as [[aluminium smelting|aluminium smelters]].\n\nLabourers working in the smelting industry have reported [[Respiratory disease|respiratory illnesses]] inhibiting their ability to perform the physical tasks demanded by their jobs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sj\u00f6strand|first=Torgny|date=1947-01-12|title=Changes in the Respiratory Organs of Workmen at an Ore Smelting Works1|journal=Acta Medica Scandinavica|language=en|volume=128|issue=S196|pages=687\u2013699|doi=10.1111/j.0954-6820.1947.tb14704.x|issn=0954-6820}}</ref>\n\n==Process==\nSmelting involves more than just melting the metal out of its ore. Most ores are the chemical compound of the metal and other elements, such as  oxygen (as an [[oxide]]), sulfur (as a [[sulfide]]), or carbon and oxygen together (as a [[carbonate]]). To extract the metal, workers must make these compounds undergo a chemical reaction. Smelting therefore consists of using suitable [[reduction (chemistry)|reducing substances]] that combine with those [[oxidation (chemistry)|oxidizing]] elements to free the metal.\n\n===Roasting===\nIn the case of carbonates and sulfides, a process called \"[[Roasting (metallurgy)|roasting]]\" drives out the unwanted carbon or sulfur, leaving an oxide, which can be directly reduced. Roasting is usually carried out in an oxidizing environment. A few practical examples:\n\n* [[Malachite]], a common ore of [[copper]], is primarily copper carbonate hydroxide Cu<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)(OH)<sub>2</sub>.<ref name=\"mindat\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mindat.org/min-2550.html|title=Malachite: Malachite mineral information and data.|publisher=mindat.org|accessdate=26 August 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908005239/http://www.mindat.org/min-2550.html|archivedate=8 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> This mineral undergoes [[thermal decomposition]] to 2CuO, CO<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O<ref name=\"asminternational\">{{cite web|url=http://www.asminternational.org/documents/10192/1942082/coppermetal.pdf/86992a2a-61db-4628-b01d-c70c0338b756|title=Copper Metal from Malachite &#124; Earth Resources|publisher=asminternational.org|accessdate=26 August 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923175352/http://www.asminternational.org/documents/10192/1942082/coppermetal.pdf/86992a2a-61db-4628-b01d-c70c0338b756|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> in several stages between 250&nbsp;\u00b0C and 350&nbsp;\u00b0C. The carbon dioxide and [[water]] are expelled into the atmosphere, leaving [[copper(II) oxide]], which can be directly reduced to copper as described in the following section titled ''Reduction''.\n* [[Galena]], the most common mineral of [[lead]], is primarily lead sulfide (PbS). The sulfide is oxidized to a sulfite (PbSO<sub>3</sub>), which thermally decomposes into lead oxide and sulfur dioxide gas. (PbO and SO<sub>2</sub>) The [[sulfur dioxide]] is expelled (like the [[carbon dioxide]] in the previous example), and the lead oxide is reduced as below.\n\n===Reduction===\nReduction is the final, high-temperature step in smelting, in which the oxide becomes the elemental metal. A reducing environment (often provided by carbon monoxide, made by incomplete combustion in an air-starved furnace) pulls the final [[oxygen]] atoms from the raw metal. The required temperature varies over a very large range, both in absolute terms and in terms of the melting point of the base metal. Examples:\n\n* [[Iron oxide]] becomes metallic iron at roughly 1250&nbsp;\u00b0C (2282&nbsp;\u00b0F or 1523.15&nbsp;K), almost 300 degrees ''below'' iron's melting point of 1538&nbsp;\u00b0C (2800.4&nbsp;\u00b0F or 1811.15&nbsp;K).{{cn|reason=seems to contradict FeO and Fe3O4 pages|date=March 2020}}\n* [[Mercuric oxide]] becomes vaporous mercury near 550&nbsp;\u00b0C (1022&nbsp;\u00b0F or 823.15&nbsp;K), almost 600 degrees ''above'' mercury's melting point of -38&nbsp;\u00b0C (-36.4&nbsp;\u00b0F or 235.15&nbsp;K).\n\nFlux and slag can provide a secondary service after the reduction step is complete: they provide a molten cover on the purified metal, preventing contact with oxygen while still hot enough to readily oxidize. This prevents impurities from forming in the metal.\n\n===Fluxes===\nMetal workers use fluxes in smelting for several purposes, chief among them catalyzing the desired reactions and chemically binding to unwanted impurities or reaction products. Calcium oxide, in the form of [[Lime (material)|lime]], was often used for this purpose, since it could react with the carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide produced during roasting and smelting to keep them out of the working environment.\n\n==History==\nOf the [[metals of antiquity|seven metals known in antiquity]], only [[gold]] occurred regularly in native form in the natural environment. The others \u2013 [[copper]], [[lead]], [[silver]], [[tin]], [[iron]] and [[mercury (element)|mercury]] \u2013 occur primarily as minerals, though copper is occasionally found in its [[native copper|native state]] in commercially significant quantities. These minerals are primarily [[carbonate]]s, [[sulfide]]s, or [[oxide]]s of the metal, mixed with other components such as [[silica]] and [[alumina]]. [[Roasting (metallurgy)|Roasting]] the carbonate and sulfide minerals in air converts them to oxides. The oxides, in turn, are smelted into the metal. Carbon monoxide was (and is) the reducing agent of choice for smelting. It is easily produced during the heating process, and as a gas comes into intimate contact with the ore.\n\nIn the [[Old World]], humans learned to smelt metals in [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] times, more than 8000 years ago. The discovery and use of the \"useful\" metals \u2014 copper and bronze at first, then iron a few millennia later \u2014 had an enormous impact on human society. The impact was so pervasive that scholars traditionally divide ancient history into [[Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]], and [[Iron Age]].\n\nIn the [[Americas]], pre-[[Inca]] civilizations of the central [[Andes]] in Peru had mastered the smelting of copper and silver at least six centuries before the first Europeans arrived in the 16th century, while never mastering the smelting of metals such as iron for use with weapon-craft.<ref name=\"sciencedaily.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/04/070423100437.htm|title=releases/2007/04/070423100437|publisher=sciencedaily.com|accessdate=26 August 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909222002/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/04/070423100437.htm|archivedate=9 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Tin and lead===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\nIn the [[Old World]], the first metals smelted were tin and lead. The earliest known cast lead beads were found in the [[\u00c7atal H\u00f6y\u00fck]] site in [[Anatolia]] ([[Turkey]]), and dated from about 6500&nbsp;BC, but the metal may have been known earlier.\n\nSince the discovery happened several millennia before the invention of writing, there is no written record about how it was made. However, tin and lead can be smelted by placing the ores in a wood fire, leaving the possibility that the discovery may have occurred by accident.\n\nLead is a common metal, but its discovery had relatively little impact in the ancient world. It is too soft to use for structural elements or weapons, though its high density relative to other metals makes it ideal for [[sling (weapon)|sling]] projectiles. However, since it was easy to cast and shape, workers in the classical world of [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]] used it extensively to pipe and store water. They also used it as a [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] in stone buildings.\n\nTin was much less common than lead and is only marginally harder, and had even less impact by itself.\n\n===Copper and bronze===\nAfter tin and lead, the next metal smelted appears to have been copper. How the discovery came about is debated. Campfires are about 200&nbsp;\u00b0C short of the temperature needed, so some propose that the first smelting of copper may have occurred in pottery [[kiln]]s. The development of copper smelting in the Andes, which is believed to have occurred independently of the [[Old World]], may have occurred in the same way.<ref name=\"sciencedaily.com\"/> The earliest current evidence of copper smelting, dating from between 5500&nbsp;BC and 5000&nbsp;BC, has been found in [[Plo\u010dnik]] and Belovode, Serbia.<ref name=\"stonepages\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/002557.html|title=Stone Pages Archaeo News: Ancient metal workshop found in Serbia|publisher=stonepages.com|accessdate=26 August 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924110730/http://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/002557.html|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"archaeologydaily\">{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeologydaily.com/news/201006274431/Belovode-site-in-Serbia-may-have-hosted-first-copper-makers.html|title=201006274431 &#124; Belovode site in Serbia may have hosted first copper makers|publisher=archaeologydaily.com|accessdate=26 August 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229205002/http://www.archaeologydaily.com/news/201006274431/Belovode-site-in-Serbia-may-have-hosted-first-copper-makers.html|archivedate=29 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  A mace head found in [[Can Hasan]], Turkey and dated to 5000&nbsp;BC, once thought to be the oldest evidence, now appears to be hammered native copper.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=Ancient Turkey|author1=Sagona, A.G.|author2=Zimansky, P.E.|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415481236|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QHAlOAAACAAJ|accessdate=26 August 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306062734/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QHAlOAAACAAJ|archivedate=6 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nCombining copper with tin and/or [[arsenic]] in the right proportions produces [[bronze]], an [[alloy]] that is significantly harder than copper. The first [[Arsenical bronze|copper/arsenic bronzes]] date from [[5th millennium BC|4200&nbsp;BC]] from [[Asia Minor]]. The Inca bronze alloys were also of this type. Arsenic is often an impurity in copper ores, so the discovery could have been made by accident. Eventually arsenic-bearing minerals were intentionally added during smelting.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nCopper\u2013tin bronzes, harder and more durable, were developed around 3200&nbsp;BC, also in Asia Minor.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nHow smiths learned to produce copper/tin bronzes is unknown. The first such bronzes may have been a lucky accident from tin-contaminated copper ores. However, by 2000&nbsp;BC, people were mining tin on purpose to produce bronze\u2014which is amazing given that tin is a semi-rare metal, and even a rich [[cassiterite]] ore only has 5% tin. Also, it takes special skills (or special instruments) to find it and locate richer [[lode]]s. However early peoples learned about tin, they understood how to use it to make bronze by  2000&nbsp;BC.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nThe discovery of copper and bronze manufacture had a significant impact on the history of the [[Old World]]. Metals were hard enough to make weapons that were heavier, stronger, and more resistant to impact damage than wood, bone, or stone equivalents. For several millennia, bronze was the material of choice for weapons such as [[sword]]s, [[dagger]]s, [[battle axe]]s, and [[spear]] and [[arrow]] points, as well as protective gear such as [[shield]]s, [[helmet]]s, [[greave]]s (metal shin guards), and other [[body armor]].

This produces a spongy mass of iron called a bloom, which then must be consolidated with a hammer to produce [[wrought iron]]. The earliest evidence to date for the bloomery smelting of iron is found at [[Tell Hammeh]], Jordan ([http://www.ironsmelting.net/www/smelting/]), and dates to 930&nbsp;BC ([[C14 dating]]).\n\n===Later iron smelting===\n{{Main|Blast furnace}}\nFrom the medieval period, an indirect process began to replace direct reduction in bloomeries. This used a [[blast furnace]] to make [[pig iron]], which then had to undergo a further process to make forgeable bar iron. Processes for the second stage include fining in a [[finery forge]] and, from the [[Industrial Revolution]], [[puddling (metallurgy)|puddling]]. Both processes are now obsolete, and wrought iron is now rarely made. Instead, mild steel is produced from a [[bessemer converter]] or by other means including smelting reduction processes such as the [[Corex Process]].\n\n==Base metals==\n[[File:Cowles furnace-2.jpg|thumb|[[Electric Smelting and Aluminum Company|Cowles Syndicate]] of [[Ohio]] in [[Stoke-upon-Trent]] [[England]], late 1880s.

In recent centuries, [[reverberatory furnace]]s have been used to keep the charge being smelted separate from the fuel. Traditionally, they were used for the first step of smelting: forming two liquids, one an oxide slag containing most of the impurities, and the other a sulfide [[matte (metallurgy)|matte]] containing the valuable metal sulfide and some impurities. Such \"reverb\" [[furnace]]s are today about 40&nbsp;meters long, 3&nbsp;meters high and 10&nbsp;meters wide. Fuel is burned at one end to melt the dry sulfide concentrates (usually after partial roasting) which are fed through openings in the roof of the furnace. The slag floats over the heavier matte and is removed and discarded or recycled. The sulfide matte is then sent to the [[converter (Metallurgical)|converter]]. The precise details of the process vary from one furnace to another depending on the mineralogy of the orebody.\n\nWhile reverberatory furnaces produced slags containing very little copper, they were relatively energy inefficient and off-gassed a low concentration of [[sulfur dioxide]] that was difficult to capture; a new generation of copper smelting technologies has supplanted them.<ref>{{cite book|author=W.

It is a form of [[extractive metallurgy]]. It is used to extract many metals from their ores, including [[Silver mining#Ore processing|silver]], [[iron-making|iron]], [[copper extraction|copper]], and other [[base metals]]. Smelting uses heat and a chemical [[reducing agent]] to decompose the ore, driving off other elements as gases or [[slag]] and leaving the metal base behind. The reducing agent is commonly a source of [[carbon]], such as [[coke (fuel)|coke]]\u2014or, in earlier times, [[charcoal]].<ref name=SmeltingEB>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Smelting |url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/smelting |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica |accessdate=2018-08-15}}</ref>\n\nThe carbon (or carbon monoxide derived from it) removes [[oxygen]] from the ore, leaving the elemental metal. The carbon thus oxidizes in two stages, producing first [[carbon monoxide]] and then [[carbon dioxide]]. As most ores are impure, it is often necessary to use [[Flux (metallurgy)|flux]], such as [[limestone]], to remove the accompanying rock [[gangue]] as slag.\n\nPlants for the [[electrolysis|electrolytic]] reduction of [[aluminium]] are also generally referred to as [[aluminium smelting|aluminium smelters]].\n\nLabourers working in the smelting industry have reported [[Respiratory disease|respiratory illnesses]] inhibiting their ability to perform the physical tasks demanded by their jobs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sj\u00f6strand|first=Torgny|date=1947-01-12|title=Changes in the Respiratory Organs of Workmen at an Ore Smelting Works1|journal=Acta Medica Scandinavica|language=en|volume=128|issue=S196|pages=687\u2013699|doi=10.1111/j.0954-6820.1947.tb14704.x|issn=0954-6820}}</ref>\n\n==Process==\nSmelting involves more than just melting the metal out of its ore. Most ores are the chemical compound of the metal and other elements, such as  oxygen (as an [[oxide]]), sulfur (as a [[sulfide]]), or carbon and oxygen together (as a [[carbonate]]). To extract the metal, workers must make these compounds undergo a chemical reaction. Smelting therefore consists of using suitable [[reduction (chemistry)|reducing substances]] that combine with those [[oxidation (chemistry)|oxidizing]] elements to free the metal.\n\n===Roasting===\nIn the case of carbonates and sulfides, a process called \"[[Roasting (metallurgy)|roasting]]\" drives out the unwanted carbon or sulfur, leaving an oxide, which can be directly reduced. Roasting is usually carried out in an oxidizing environment. A few practical examples:\n\n* [[Malachite]], a common ore of [[copper]], is primarily copper carbonate hydroxide Cu<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)(OH)<sub>2</sub>.<ref name=\"mindat\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mindat.org/min-2550.html|title=Malachite: Malachite mineral information and data.|publisher=mindat.org|accessdate=26 August 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908005239/http://www.mindat.org/min-2550.html|archivedate=8 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> This mineral undergoes [[thermal decomposition]] to 2CuO, CO<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O<ref name=\"asminternational\">{{cite web|url=http://www.asminternational.org/documents/10192/1942082/coppermetal.pdf/86992a2a-61db-4628-b01d-c70c0338b756|title=Copper Metal from Malachite &#124; Earth Resources|publisher=asminternational.org|accessdate=26 August 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923175352/http://www.asminternational.org/documents/10192/1942082/coppermetal.pdf/86992a2a-61db-4628-b01d-c70c0338b756|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> in several stages between 250&nbsp;\u00b0C and 350&nbsp;\u00b0C. The carbon dioxide and [[water]] are expelled into the atmosphere, leaving [[copper(II) oxide]], which can be directly reduced to copper as described in the following section titled ''Reduction''.\n* [[Galena]], the most common mineral of [[lead]], is primarily lead sulfide (PbS). The sulfide is oxidized to a sulfite (PbSO<sub>3</sub>), which thermally decomposes into lead oxide and sulfur dioxide gas. (PbO and SO<sub>2</sub>) The [[sulfur dioxide]] is expelled (like the [[carbon dioxide]] in the previous example), and the lead oxide is reduced as below.\n\n===Reduction===\nReduction is the final, high-temperature step in smelting, in which the oxide becomes the elemental metal. A reducing environment (often provided by carbon monoxide, made by incomplete combustion in an air-starved furnace) pulls the final [[oxygen]] atoms from the raw metal. The required temperature varies over a very large range, both in absolute terms and in terms of the melting point of the base metal. Examples:\n\n* [[Iron oxide]] becomes metallic iron at roughly 1250&nbsp;\u00b0C (2282&nbsp;\u00b0F or 1523.15&nbsp;K), almost 300 degrees ''below'' iron's melting point of 1538&nbsp;\u00b0C (2800.4&nbsp;\u00b0F or 1811.15&nbsp;K).{{cn|reason=seems to contradict FeO and Fe3O4 pages|date=March 2020}}\n* [[Mercuric oxide]] becomes vaporous mercury near 550&nbsp;\u00b0C (1022&nbsp;\u00b0F or 823.15&nbsp;K), almost 600 degrees ''above'' mercury's melting point of -38&nbsp;\u00b0C (-36.4&nbsp;\u00b0F or 235.15&nbsp;K).\n\nFlux and slag can provide a secondary service after the reduction step is complete: they provide a molten cover on the purified metal, preventing contact with oxygen while still hot enough to readily oxidize. This prevents impurities from forming in the metal.\n\n===Fluxes===\nMetal workers use fluxes in smelting for several purposes, chief among them catalyzing the desired reactions and chemically binding to unwanted impurities or reaction products. Calcium oxide, in the form of [[Lime (material)|lime]], was often used for this purpose, since it could react with the carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide produced during roasting and smelting to keep them out of the working environment.\n\n==History==\nOf the [[metals of antiquity|seven metals known in antiquity]], only [[gold]] occurred regularly in native form in the natural environment. The others \u2013 [[copper]], [[lead]], [[silver]], [[tin]], [[iron]] and [[mercury (element)|mercury]] \u2013 occur primarily as minerals, though copper is occasionally found in its [[native copper|native state]] in commercially significant quantities. These minerals are primarily [[carbonate]]s, [[sulfide]]s, or [[oxide]]s of the metal, mixed with other components such as [[silica]] and [[alumina]]. [[Roasting (metallurgy)|Roasting]] the carbonate and sulfide minerals in air converts them to oxides. The oxides, in turn, are smelted into the metal. Carbon monoxide was (and is) the reducing agent of choice for smelting. It is easily produced during the heating process, and as a gas comes into intimate contact with the ore.\n\nIn the [[Old World]], humans learned to smelt metals in [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] times, more than 8000 years ago. The discovery and use of the \"useful\" metals \u2014 copper and bronze at first, then iron a few millennia later \u2014 had an enormous impact on human society. The impact was so pervasive that scholars traditionally divide ancient history into [[Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]], and [[Iron Age]].\n\nIn the [[Americas]], pre-[[Inca]] civilizations of the central [[Andes]] in Peru had mastered the smelting of copper and silver at least six centuries before the first Europeans arrived in the 16th century, while never mastering the smelting of metals such as iron for use with weapon-craft.<ref name=\"sciencedaily.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/04/070423100437.htm|title=releases/2007/04/070423100437|publisher=sciencedaily.com|accessdate=26 August 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909222002/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/04/070423100437.htm|archivedate=9 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Tin and lead===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\nIn the [[Old World]], the first metals smelted were tin and lead. The earliest known cast lead beads were found in the [[\u00c7atal H\u00f6y\u00fck]] site in [[Anatolia]] ([[Turkey]]), and dated from about 6500&nbsp;BC, but the metal may have been known earlier.\n\nSince the discovery happened several millennia before the invention of writing, there is no written record about how it was made. However, tin and lead can be smelted by placing the ores in a wood fire, leaving the possibility that the discovery may have occurred by accident.\n\nLead is a common metal, but its discovery had relatively little impact in the ancient world. It is too soft to use for structural elements or weapons, though its high density relative to other metals makes it ideal for [[sling (weapon)|sling]] projectiles. However, since it was easy to cast and shape, workers in the classical world of [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]] used it extensively to pipe and store water. They also used it as a [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] in stone buildings.\n\nTin was much less common than lead and is only marginally harder, and had even less impact by itself.\n\n===Copper and bronze===\nAfter tin and lead, the next metal smelted appears to have been copper. How the discovery came about is debated. Campfires are about 200&nbsp;\u00b0C short of the temperature needed, so some propose that the first smelting of copper may have occurred in pottery [[kiln]]s. The development of copper smelting in the Andes, which is believed to have occurred independently of the [[Old World]], may have occurred in the same way.<ref name=\"sciencedaily.com\"/> The earliest current evidence of copper smelting, dating from between 5500&nbsp;BC and 5000&nbsp;BC, has been found in [[Plo\u010dnik]] and Belovode, Serbia.<ref name=\"stonepages\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/002557.html|title=Stone Pages Archaeo News: Ancient metal workshop found in Serbia|publisher=stonepages.com|accessdate=26 August 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924110730/http://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/002557.html|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"archaeologydaily\">{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeologydaily.com/news/201006274431/Belovode-site-in-Serbia-may-have-hosted-first-copper-makers.html|title=201006274431 &#124; Belovode site in Serbia may have hosted first copper makers|publisher=archaeologydaily.com|accessdate=26 August 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229205002/http://www.archaeologydaily.com/news/201006274431/Belovode-site-in-Serbia-may-have-hosted-first-copper-makers.html|archivedate=29 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  A mace head found in [[Can Hasan]], Turkey and dated to 5000&nbsp;BC, once thought to be the oldest evidence, now appears to be hammered native copper.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=Ancient Turkey|author1=Sagona, A.G.|author2=Zimansky, P.E.|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415481236|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QHAlOAAACAAJ|accessdate=26 August 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306062734/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QHAlOAAACAAJ|archivedate=6 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nCombining copper with tin and/or [[arsenic]] in the right proportions produces [[bronze]], an [[alloy]] that is significantly harder than copper. The first [[Arsenical bronze|copper/arsenic bronzes]] date from [[5th millennium BC|4200&nbsp;BC]] from [[Asia Minor]]. The Inca bronze alloys were also of this type. Arsenic is often an impurity in copper ores, so the discovery could have been made by accident. Eventually arsenic-bearing minerals were intentionally added during smelting.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nCopper\u2013tin bronzes, harder and more durable, were developed around 3200&nbsp;BC, also in Asia Minor.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nHow smiths learned to produce copper/tin bronzes is unknown. The first such bronzes may have been a lucky accident from tin-contaminated copper ores. However, by 2000&nbsp;BC, people were mining tin on purpose to produce bronze\u2014which is amazing given that tin is a semi-rare metal, and even a rich [[cassiterite]] ore only has 5% tin. Also, it takes special skills (or special instruments) to find it and locate richer [[lode]]s. However early peoples learned about tin, they understood how to use it to make bronze by  2000&nbsp;BC.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nThe discovery of copper and bronze manufacture had a significant impact on the history of the [[Old World]]. Metals were hard enough to make weapons that were heavier, stronger, and more resistant to impact damage than wood, bone, or stone equivalents. For several millennia, bronze was the material of choice for weapons such as [[sword]]s, [[dagger]]s, [[battle axe]]s, and [[spear]] and [[arrow]] points, as well as protective gear such as [[shield]]s, [[helmet]]s, [[greave]]s (metal shin guards), and other [[body armor]].

This produces a spongy mass of iron called a bloom, which then must be consolidated with a hammer to produce [[wrought iron]]. The earliest evidence to date for the bloomery smelting of iron is found at [[Tell Hammeh]], Jordan ([http://www.ironsmelting.net/www/smelting/]), and dates to 930&nbsp;BC ([[C14 dating]]).\n\n===Later iron smelting===\n{{Main|Blast furnace}}\nFrom the medieval period, an indirect process began to replace direct reduction in bloomeries. This used a [[blast furnace]] to make [[pig iron]], which then had to undergo a further process to make forgeable bar iron. Processes for the second stage include fining in a [[finery forge]] and, from the [[Industrial Revolution]], [[puddling (metallurgy)|puddling]]. Both processes are now obsolete, and wrought iron is now rarely made. Instead, mild steel is produced from a [[bessemer converter]] or by other means including smelting reduction processes such as the [[Corex Process]].\n\n==Base metals==\n[[File:Cowles furnace-2.jpg|thumb|[[Electric Smelting and Aluminum Company|Cowles Syndicate]] of [[Ohio]] in [[Stoke-upon-Trent]] [[England]], late 1880s.

In recent centuries, [[reverberatory furnace]]s have been used to keep the charge being smelted separate from the fuel. Traditionally, they were used for the first step of smelting: forming two liquids, one an oxide slag containing most of the impurities, and the other a sulfide [[matte (metallurgy)|matte]] containing the valuable metal sulfide and some impurities. Such \"reverb\" [[furnace]]s are today about 40&nbsp;meters long, 3&nbsp;meters high and 10&nbsp;meters wide. Fuel is burned at one end to melt the dry sulfide concentrates (usually after partial roasting) which are fed through openings in the roof of the furnace. The slag floats over the heavier matte and is removed and discarded or recycled. The sulfide matte is then sent to the [[converter (Metallurgical)|converter]]. The precise details of the process vary from one furnace to another depending on the mineralogy of the orebody.\n\nWhile reverberatory furnaces produced slags containing very little copper, they were relatively energy inefficient and off-gassed a low concentration of [[sulfur dioxide]] that was difficult to capture; a new generation of copper smelting technologies has supplanted them.<ref>{{cite book|author=W.

It features a team-based\ncompetition format with fast-paced race sessions. In 2019, the regular season started in October and the Final Match was held in December.\n\nAthletes previously disqualified for breaking anti-doping rules are banned from ISL.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://isl.global/competition-format/|title=Competition format|work=ISL|access-date=10 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Format ==\n\n=== ISL Season ===\nThe season is split into a regular championship and a final. In the regular championship clubs earn points from participating in matches according to the following principle: 4 points for 1st place in the match, 3 for 2nd, 2 for 3rd and 1 for 4th. After all of the championship matches, 4 clubs with the highest number of points advance to the final, where the winner of the league (the ISL Champions) are determined. Each club can have a maximum roster of 32 athletes. At each match 28 of these are permitted to compete - 12 men and 12 women can swim individual races, while 2 men and 2 women can be used as \"relay only\" athletes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://isl.global/isl-2019-technical-information/|title=ISL 2019 technical information \u2013 International Swimming League|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\n=== ISL Matches ===\nFour clubs take part in a match. During the first season, an ISL match consisted of 37 races: 30 individual, 5 team relays and 2 skin races. Each race consists of 2 representatives from each of the clubs. Points are distributed after the race in the following manner: 9 points for 1st, 7 for 2nd, ... 1 for 8th. Points are not awarded to athletes (teams) that fail to finish a race. In addition, points are doubled in relays and are awarded after each of the 3 skin race heats.\n\nThe points of the clubs\u2019 representatives are then added together and go towards the total points result of their respective clubs.\n\nA victory in a race does not guarantee maximum club points. As an example, club representatives that finish 1st and 7th in a race will earn less points for their respective clubs than those who finish 2nd and 4th: they will score 11 and 12 total points, respectively.\n\nA match is won by the club that has scored the most points in all of the 37 races. Similarly, the rest of the clubs are distributed through 2nd to 4th place, respective of the points they score during the entire match. Theoretically, a match could be won by a team that has not won a single race.\n\nIn case two or more clubs end up with the same number of points after the match, an extra mixed medley 4x50m relay shall take place, the outcome of which will mirror the final results of the match.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://isl.global/isl-2019-technical-information/|title=ISL 2019 technical information \u2013 International Swimming League|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\n==Teams==\nThe [[2019 International Swimming League|inaugural league]] debuted with eight teams across two conferences, four from the United States, and four from Europe. Each team appeared in a pair of inter-conference matches involving two teams from each conference, one in America and one in Europe, and a \"derby\" match involving all four teams from its own conference. The top two teams in each conference met in a Grand final in [[Las Vegas]].\n\nAt the 2019 Grand Final, the ISL announced a further two franchises, as yet unnamed, would be joining an expanded ISL for 2020; one from Toronto and one from Tokyo.

In each event, all the clubs competing must line up two athletes (and also two teams in the relays), with a consistent lane assignment throughout the day, which is randomly assigned at the start of each match.<ref name=format /> Team line-ups are submitted prior to each competition session. These line-ups can be changed and adjusted during the scheduled breaks within the competition. This has to be done 2-minutes after the conclusion of the last event in the previous session.\nIn 2019 there was total of 37 races, and in 2020 a total of 39 races, among individual events, relay and skin races, are held during one match (the 4x50 medley mixed relay will only be held if two teams tie in points at the end of all the previous races).<ref name=format>{{cite web|url=https://isl.global/isl-2019-technical-information/|title=ISL 2019 technical information|work=ISL|access-date=10 October 2019}}</ref><br>\nPoints are awarded to the teams at the end of each match as follows:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!style='background:#0E1A27; color:white;'|Place||1st||2nd||3rd||4th\n|-\n!style='background:#0E1A27; color:white;'|Points||4||3||2||1\n|}\n\nIn 2019, the two American and European teams with most points in standings at the end of the regular season advance to the Final Match (if two teams are tied, cumulative points of these clubs will be taken into account and if still tied there will be a swim-off, which will be 4x50 medley mixed).<br>\nThe scoring for each individual event is as follows (relays races will score double the points):<ref name=format />\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!style='background:#0E1A27; color:white;'|Place||1st||2nd||3rd||4th||5th||6th||7th||8th||{{Tooltip|DNF|Did not finish}}||{{Tooltip|DSQ|Disqualified}}||{{Tooltip|DNS|Did not start}}\n|-\n!style='background:#0E1A27; color:white;'|Points||9||7||6||5||4||3||2||1||colspan=\"2\"|-2||-4\n|}\n\n===Relay races===\nA particular points scoring system has been introduced for relay races, which score double points than individual events.

It features a team-based\ncompetition format with fast-paced race sessions. In 2019, the regular season started in October and the Final Match was held in December.\n\nAthletes previously disqualified for breaking anti-doping rules are banned from ISL.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://isl.global/competition-format/|title=Competition format|work=ISL|access-date=10 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Format ==\n\n=== ISL Season ===\nThe season is split into a regular championship and a final. In the regular championship clubs earn points from participating in matches according to the following principle: 4 points for 1st place in the match, 3 for 2nd, 2 for 3rd and 1 for 4th. After all of the championship matches, 4 clubs with the highest number of points advance to the final, where the winner of the league (the ISL Champions) are determined. Each club can have a maximum roster of 32 athletes. At each match 28 of these are permitted to compete - 12 men and 12 women can swim individual races, while 2 men and 2 women can be used as \"relay only\" athletes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://isl.global/isl-2019-technical-information/|title=ISL 2019 technical information \u2013 International Swimming League|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\n=== ISL Matches ===\nFour clubs take part in a match. During the first season, an ISL match consisted of 37 races: 30 individual, 5 team relays and 2 skin races. Each race consists of 2 representatives from each of the clubs. Points are distributed after the race in the following manner: 9 points for 1st, 7 for 2nd, ... 1 for 8th. Points are not awarded to athletes (teams) that fail to finish a race. In addition, points are doubled in relays and are awarded after each of the 3 skin race heats.\n\nThe points of the clubs\u2019 representatives are then added together and go towards the total points result of their respective clubs.\n\nA victory in a race does not guarantee maximum club points. As an example, club representatives that finish 1st and 7th in a race will earn less points for their respective clubs than those who finish 2nd and 4th: they will score 11 and 12 total points, respectively.\n\nA match is won by the club that has scored the most points in all of the 37 races. Similarly, the rest of the clubs are distributed through 2nd to 4th place, respective of the points they score during the entire match. Theoretically, a match could be won by a team that has not won a single race.\n\nIn case 2 or more clubs end up with the same amount of points after the match, an extra mixed medley 4x50m relay shall take place, the outcome of which will mirror the final results of the match.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://isl.global/isl-2019-technical-information/|title=ISL 2019 technical information \u2013 International Swimming League|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n<br />\n==Teams==\nThe [[2019 International Swimming League|inaugural league]] debuted with eight teams across two conferences, four from the United States, and four from Europe. Each team appeared in a pair of inter-conference matches involving two teams from each conference, one in America and one in Europe, and a \"derby\" match involving all four teams from its own conference. The top two teams in each conference met in a Grand final in [[Las Vegas]].\n\nAt the 2019 Grand Final, the ISL announced a further two franchises, as yet unnamed, would be joining an expanded ISL for 2020; one from Toronto and one from Tokyo.

Vieques is part of the [[commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|Commonwealth]] of Puerto Rico, and retains strong influences from 400 years of Spanish presence in the island.\n\nVieques lies about {{convert|8|mi|km|0}} east of the Puerto Rican mainland, and measures about {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} long by {{convert|4.5|mi|km|0}} wide. Its most populated barrio is [[Isabel Segunda, Puerto Rico|Isabel Segunda]] (sometimes written \"Isabel II\"), the administrative center on the northern side. The population of Vieques was 9,301 at the 2010 Census.\n\nThe island's name is a Spanish spelling of a Native American (likely [[Ta\u00edno language|Ta\u00edno]]) word said to mean \"small island\". It also has the nickname ''Isla Nena'', usually translated as \"Little Girl Island\", alluding to its perception as Puerto Rico's little sister. The island was given this name by the Puerto Rican poet [[Luis Llorens Torres]]. During the colonial period, the British name was \"Crab Island\".\n\nVieques is best known internationally as the site of a [[United States Navy in Vieques, Puerto Rico|series of protests]] against the [[United States Navy]]'s use of the island as a [[bombing range]] and testing ground, which led to the Navy's departure in 2003. Today the former navy land is a national wildlife refuge; some of it is open to the public, but much remains closed off due to contamination and/or unexploded ordinance that the military is slowly cleaning up. Some of the most beautiful beaches on the island are on the eastern end of the island (formerly the Marine Base) that the Navy named Red Beach, Blue Beach, etc., now called Playa Caracas, Pata Prieta, Playa La Chiva, and Playa Plata. At the far western tip (formerly the Navy Base) is Punta Arenas, which the Navy named Green Beach. The beaches are commonly listed among the top beaches in the Caribbean for their azure waters and white sands.\n\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-Columbian history===\nArchaeological evidence suggests that Vieques was first inhabited by ancient [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] peoples who traveled from continental America perhaps between 3000 BCE and 2000 BCE. Estimates of these prehistoric dates of inhabitation vary widely. These tribes had a Stone Age culture and were probably fishermen and hunter-gatherers.\n\nExcavations at the Puerto Ferro site by Luis Chanlatte and Yvonne Narganes<ref>{{cite journal |title=Current Research |date=January 1992 |journal=[[American Antiquity]] |volume=57 |number=1 |pages=146\u2013163 |doi=10.1017/S0002731600051222}}</ref> uncovered a fragmented human skeleton in a large hearth area. Radiocarbon dating of shells found in the hearth indicate a burial date of c. 1900 BCE. This skeleton, popularly known as ''El Hombre de Puerto Ferro'', was buried at the center of a group of large boulders near Vieques's south-central coast, approximately one kilometer northwest of the Bioluminescent Bay. Linear arrays of smaller stones radiating from the central boulders are apparent at the site today, but their age and reason for placement are unknown.\n\nFurther waves of settlement by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] followed over many centuries. The [[Arawakan languages|Arawak]]-speaking [[Saladoid]] (or [[Igneri]]) people, thought to have originated in modern-day Venezuela, arrived in the region perhaps around 200 BC (estimates vary). These tribes, noted for their pottery, stone carving, and other artifacts, eventually merged with groups from [[Hispaniola]] and [[Cuba]] to form what is now called the [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00edno]] culture. This culture flourished in the region from around 1000 AD until the arrival of [[European ethnic groups|European]]s in the late 15th century.\n\n===Spanish colonial period===\nThe European discovery of Vieques is sometimes credited to [[Christopher Columbus]], who landed in Puerto Rico in 1493. It does not seem to be certain whether Columbus personally visited Vieques, but in any case the island was soon claimed by the Spanish. During the early 16th century Vieques became a center of Ta\u00edno rebellion against the European invaders, prompting the Spanish to send armed forces to the island to quell the resistance. The native Ta\u00edno population was decimated, and its people either killed, imprisoned or enslaved by the Spanish.<ref name=\"Historic Resources_UFDC\">{{cite journal |url=https://ufdcimages.uflib.ufl.edu/AA/00/06/19/61/00673/17-25.pdf |title=Historic Resources on the Vieques Naval Reservation and the Historical Development of Vieques Island, Puerto Rico |first1=Michael A. |last1=Cinquino |first2=Carmine A. |last2=Tronolone |first3=Charles |last3=Vandrei |first4=Gary S. |last4=Vescelius |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Proceedings of the 17th Congress for Caribbean Archaeology |date=1997 |pages=376\u2013387 |via=University of Florida Digital Collections |accessdate=June 26, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190626221350/https://ufdcimages.uflib.ufl.edu/AA/00/06/19/61/00673/17-25.pdf |archive-date=June 26, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe Spanish did not, however, permanently colonise Vieques at this time, and for the next 300 years it remained a lawless outpost, frequented by pirates and outlaws. As European powers fought for control in the region, a series of attempts by the French, English and Danish to colonise the island in the 17th and 18th centuries were repulsed by the Spanish. The island also received considerable attention as a possible colony from Scotland, and after numerous attempts to buy the island proved unsuccessful, the Scottish fleet, en route to Darien in 1698, made landfall and took possession of the island in the name of the [[Company of Scotland|Company of Scotland Trading to Africa and The Indies]]. Scottish sovereignty of the island proved short-lived, as a Danish ship arrived shortly afterward and claimed the island. From 1689 to 1693 the island was controlled by [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] as the \"Isle of Crabs\" (German: ''Krabbeninsel'').\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, the Spanish took steps to permanently settle and secure the island. In 1811, Don Salvador Mel\u00e9ndez, then governor of Puerto Rico, sent military commander Juan Rossell\u00f3 to begin what would become the annexation of Vieques by the Puerto Ricans.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mullenneaux |first=Lisa |title=Ni Una Bomba M\u00e1s!: Vieques vs. U.S. Navy |location=New York |publisher=Penington Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-97042-960-5 |page=22}}</ref> In 1832, under an agreement with the Spanish Puerto Rican administration, Frenchman [[Te\u00f3filo Jos\u00e9 Jaime Mar\u00eda Le Guillou]] became Governor of Vieques, and undertook to impose order on the anarchic province. He was instrumental in the establishment of large plantations, marking a period of social and economic change. Le Guillou is now remembered as the \"founder\" of Vieques (though this title is also sometimes conferred on Francisco Sa\u00ednz, governor from 1843 to 1852, who founded Isabel Segunda, the \"town of Vieques\", named after [[Isabella II of Spain|Queen Isabel II]] of Spain). Vieques was formally annexed to Puerto Rico in 1854.\n\nIn 1816, Vieques was briefly visited by [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] when his ship ran aground there while fleeing defeat in Venezuela.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Keeling |first=Stephen |title=The Rough Guide to Puerto Rico |publisher=[[Rough Guides]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-85828-354-8 |page=162 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bKWIc9uQd_cC&pg=PA162 |access-date=2016-03-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322194438/http://books.google.com/books?id=bKWIc9uQd_cC&pg=PA162 |archive-date=2015-03-22 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nDuring the second part of the 19th century, thousands of black immigrants came to Vieques to work on the [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|sugarcane plantations]]. They arrived from the nearby islands of [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]], [[Nevis]], [[Saint Kitts]], [[Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Croix]], and many other Caribbean islands, some of them as [[Atlantic slave trade|slaves]] and some as independent economic migrants.{{Clarify|date=November 2009}}<!-- Mispunctuated and unclear.

Or something else? -->  By the time of settlement of Vieques the Eastern Caribbean was post-Emancipation but some arrived as contract labor. Since this time black people have formed an important part of Vieques's society.\n\n===United States control===\n[[File:Vieques, PR.jpg|thumb|Municipio de Vieques plaque]]\nIn 1898, after Spain's defeat in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], Vieques, along with mainland Puerto Rico, was ceded to the United States.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, the sugar industry, on which Vieques was totally dependent, went into decline due to falling prices and industrial unrest. Many locals were forced to move to mainland Puerto Rico or [[Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Croix]] to look for work.\n\nIn 1941, while Europe was in the midst of World War II, the United States Navy purchased or seized about two thirds of Vieques as an extension to the [[Roosevelt Roads Naval Station]] nearby on the Puerto Rican mainland.

Crops grown on the island include [[avocado]]s, [[banana]]s, [[coconut]]s, grains, [[papaya]]s and [[sweet potato]]es. A small number of permanent local jobs were provided by the US Navy. Since the 1970s [[General Electric]] has employed a few hundred workers at a manufacturing plant. Unemployment was widespread, with consequent social problems.

{{IPA-es|\u02c8bjekes}}), in full '''Isla de Vieques''', is an [[Islands of Puerto Rico|island]]&ndash;[[Municipalities of Puerto Rico|municipality]] of [[Puerto Rico]], in the northeastern Caribbean, part of an island grouping sometimes known as the [[Spanish Virgin Islands]]. Vieques is part of the [[commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|Commonwealth]] of Puerto Rico, and retains strong influences from 400 years of Spanish presence in the island.\n\nVieques lies about {{convert|8|mi|km|0}} east of the Puerto Rican mainland, and measures about {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} long by {{convert|4.5|mi|km|0}} wide. Its most populated barrio is [[Isabel Segunda, Puerto Rico|Isabel Segunda]] (sometimes written \"Isabel II\"), the administrative center on the northern side. The population of Vieques was 9,301 at the 2010 Census.\n\nThe island's name is a Spanish spelling of a Native American (likely [[Ta\u00edno language|Ta\u00edno]]) word said to mean \"small island\". It also has the nickname ''Isla Nena'', usually translated as \"Little Girl Island\", alluding to its perception as Puerto Rico's little sister. The island was given this name by the Puerto Rican poet [[Luis Llorens Torres]]. During the colonial period, the British name was \"Crab Island\".\n\nVieques is best known internationally as the site of a [[United States Navy in Vieques, Puerto Rico|series of protests]] against the [[United States Navy]]'s use of the island as a [[bombing range]] and testing ground, which led to the Navy's departure in 2003. Today the former navy land is a national wildlife refuge; some of it is open to the public, but much remains closed off due to contamination and/or unexploded ordinance that the military is slowly cleaning up. Some of the most beautiful beaches on the island are on the eastern end of the island (formerly the Marine Base) that the Navy named Red Beach, Blue Beach, etc., now called Playa Caracas, Pata Prieta, Playa La Chiva, and Playa Plata. At the far western tip (formerly the Navy Base) is Punta Arenas, which the Navy named Green Beach. The beaches are commonly listed among the top beaches in the Caribbean for their azure waters and white sands.\n\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-Columbian history===\nArchaeological evidence suggests that Vieques was first inhabited by ancient [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] peoples who traveled from continental America perhaps between 3000 BCE and 2000 BCE. Estimates of these prehistoric dates of inhabitation vary widely. These tribes had a Stone Age culture and were probably fishermen and hunter-gatherers.\n\nExcavations at the Puerto Ferro site by Luis Chanlatte and Yvonne Narganes<ref>{{cite journal |title=Current Research |date=January 1992 |journal=[[American Antiquity]] |volume=57 |number=1 |pages=146\u2013163 |doi=10.1017/S0002731600051222}}</ref> uncovered a fragmented human skeleton in a large hearth area. Radiocarbon dating of shells found in the hearth indicate a burial date of c. 1900 BCE. This skeleton, popularly known as ''El Hombre de Puerto Ferro'', was buried at the center of a group of large boulders near Vieques's south-central coast, approximately one kilometer northwest of the Bioluminescent Bay. Linear arrays of smaller stones radiating from the central boulders are apparent at the site today, but their age and reason for placement are unknown.\n\nFurther waves of settlement by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] followed over many centuries. The [[Arawakan languages|Arawak]]-speaking [[Saladoid]] (or [[Igneri]]) people, thought to have originated in modern-day Venezuela, arrived in the region perhaps around 200 BC (estimates vary). These tribes, noted for their pottery, stone carving, and other artifacts, eventually merged with groups from [[Hispaniola]] and [[Cuba]] to form what is now called the [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00edno]] culture. This culture flourished in the region from around 1000 AD until the arrival of [[European ethnic groups|European]]s in the late 15th century.\n\n===Spanish colonial period===\nThe European discovery of Vieques is sometimes credited to [[Christopher Columbus]], who landed in Puerto Rico in 1493. It does not seem to be certain whether Columbus personally visited Vieques, but in any case the island was soon claimed by the Spanish. During the early 16th century Vieques became a center of Ta\u00edno rebellion against the European invaders, prompting the Spanish to send armed forces to the island to quell the resistance. The native Ta\u00edno population was decimated, and its people either killed, imprisoned or enslaved by the Spanish.<ref name=\"Historic Resources_UFDC\">{{cite journal |url=https://ufdcimages.uflib.ufl.edu/AA/00/06/19/61/00673/17-25.pdf |title=Historic Resources on the Vieques Naval Reservation and the Historical Development of Vieques Island, Puerto Rico |first1=Michael A. |last1=Cinquino |first2=Carmine A. |last2=Tronolone |first3=Charles |last3=Vandrei |first4=Gary S. |last4=Vescelius |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Proceedings of the 17th Congress for Caribbean Archaeology |date=1997 |pages=376\u2013387 |via=University of Florida Digital Collections |accessdate=June 26, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190626221350/https://ufdcimages.uflib.ufl.edu/AA/00/06/19/61/00673/17-25.pdf |archive-date=June 26, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe Spanish did not, however, permanently colonise Vieques at this time, and for the next 300 years it remained a lawless outpost, frequented by pirates and outlaws. As European powers fought for control in the region, a series of attempts by the French, English and Danish to colonise the island in the 17th and 18th centuries were repulsed by the Spanish. The island also received considerable attention as a possible colony from Scotland, and after numerous attempts to buy the island proved unsuccessful, the Scottish fleet, en route to Darien in 1698, made landfall and took possession of the island in the name of the [[Company of Scotland|Company of Scotland Trading to Africa and The Indies]]. Scottish sovereignty of the island proved short-lived, as a Danish ship arrived shortly afterward and claimed the island. From 1689 to 1693 the island was controlled by [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] as the \"Isle of Crabs\" (German: ''Krabbeninsel'').\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, the Spanish took steps to permanently settle and secure the island. In 1811, Don Salvador Mel\u00e9ndez, then governor of Puerto Rico, sent military commander Juan Rossell\u00f3 to begin what would become the annexation of Vieques by the Puerto Ricans.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mullenneaux |first=Lisa |title=Ni Una Bomba M\u00e1s!: Vieques vs. U.S. Navy |location=New York |publisher=Penington Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-97042-960-5 |page=22}}</ref> In 1832, under an agreement with the Spanish Puerto Rican administration, Frenchman [[Te\u00f3filo Jos\u00e9 Jaime Mar\u00eda Le Guillou]] became Governor of Vieques, and undertook to impose order on the anarchic province. He was instrumental in the establishment of large plantations, marking a period of social and economic change. Le Guillou is now remembered as the \"founder\" of Vieques (though this title is also sometimes conferred on Francisco Sa\u00ednz, governor from 1843 to 1852, who founded Isabel Segunda, the \"town of Vieques\", named after [[Isabella II of Spain|Queen Isabel II]] of Spain). Vieques was formally annexed to Puerto Rico in 1854.\n\nIn 1816, Vieques was briefly visited by [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] when his ship ran aground there while fleeing defeat in Venezuela.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Keeling |first=Stephen |title=The Rough Guide to Puerto Rico |publisher=[[Rough Guides]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-85828-354-8 |page=162 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bKWIc9uQd_cC&pg=PA162 |access-date=2016-03-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322194438/http://books.google.com/books?id=bKWIc9uQd_cC&pg=PA162 |archive-date=2015-03-22 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nDuring the second part of the 19th century, thousands of black immigrants came to Vieques to work on the [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|sugarcane plantations]].

Many locals were forced to move to mainland Puerto Rico or [[Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Croix]] to look for work.\n\nIn 1941, while Europe was in the midst of World War II, the United States Navy purchased or seized about two thirds of Vieques as an extension to the [[Roosevelt Roads Naval Station]] nearby on the Puerto Rican mainland. The original purpose of the base (never implemented) was to provide a safe haven for the British fleet should Britain fall to [[Nazi Germany]]. Much of the land was bought from the owners of large farms and sugar cane plantations, and the purchase triggered the final demise of the sugar industry. Many agricultural workers, who had no formal title to the land they occupied, were evicted.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/soc/faculty/ayala/vieques/Papers/06ayalacentro.pdf |title=From Sugar Plantations to Military Bases: the U.S. Navy's Expropriations in Vieques, Puerto Rico, 1940-45 |last=Ayala |first=C\u00e9sar |date=Spring 2001 |journal=Centro: Journal of the Center for Puerto Rican Studies |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=22\u201344 |via=Department of Sociology, UCLA |access-date=July 21, 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227114757/http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/soc/faculty/ayala/vieques/Papers/06ayalacentro.pdf |archive-date=February 27, 2009}}</ref>\n\nAfter the war, the US Navy continued to use the island for military exercises, and as a firing range and testing ground for [[munitions]].\n\n===Protests and departure of the United States Navy===\n{{Main|United States Navy in Vieques, Puerto Rico}}\n[[File:Radar in Vieques, Puerto Rico.jpg|thumb|Radar in Vieques, Puerto Rico]]\nThe continuing postwar presence in Vieques of the United States Navy drew protests from the local community, angry at the expropriation of their land and the environmental impact of weapons testing.

Crops grown on the island include [[avocado]]s, [[banana]]s, [[coconut]]s, grains, [[papaya]]s and [[sweet potato]]es. A small number of permanent local jobs were provided by the US Navy. Since the 1970s [[General Electric]] has employed a few hundred workers at a manufacturing plant. Unemployment was widespread, with consequent social problems.

By 2002, it was evident that thousands of tons of steel that had originally been irradiated in the 1958 nuclear tests was missing from the wreckage in the bay. That steel has been missing for over 35 years and is still unaccounted for by the US Navy, [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] and US [[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]] (ATSDR). Hundreds of steel drums of unknown origin were found among the wreckage. Their identity and contents have not been adequately verified.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nIn response to concerns about potential contamination from toxic metals and other chemicals, the ATSDR conducted a number of surveys in 1999&ndash;2002 to test Vieques' soil, water supply, air, fish and shellfish for harmful substances. The general conclusion of the ATSDR survey was that no public health hazard existed as a result of the Navy's activities.<ref name=ATSDR /> However, scientists have pointed out that fish samples were drawn from local markets, which often import fish from other areas. Also sample sizes from each location were too small to provide compelling evidence for the lack of a public health danger (Wargo, Green Intelligence). The conclusions of the ATSDR report have more recently, {{As of|2009|lc=y}}, been questioned and discredited.
