military to assist in tackling it. One such report from ''Sky News'' stated that 10,000 troops were being put on standby in the event the outbreak escalated with proposals made on how \"cope with the breakdown of civil society\".<ref>{{cite news |title=Coronavirus: Thousands of armed forces staff could be put on standby over COVID-19 spread |url=https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-more-than-10-000-armed-forces-staff-put-on-standby-11958144?fbclid=IwAR2jSO5NzT-hp6gXVrkNSBSkYJLNtGo6_WV-zeGu3ke6xSn9a4P560dX7s8 |accessdate=20 March 2020 |agency=Sky News |date=16 March 2019}}</ref> The reports caused widespread concerns, prompting [[Defence Secretary]] [[Ben Wallace (politician)|Ben Wallace]] to dismiss many of the \"fictional\" stories being reported in the media.<ref>{{cite news |title=Defence Secretary warns over media hype relating to Coronavirus |url=https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/defence-secretary-warns-over-media-hype-relating-to-coronavirus/ |accessdate=20 March 2020 |agency=UK Defence Journal |date=17 March 2020}}</ref> On 19 March 2020, a further 10,000 British military personnel were put on standby to form the COVID Support Force.<ref>{{cite news |title=Coronavirus: 20,000 British Personnel At Higher Readiness |url=https://www.forces.net/news/extra-10000-british-troops-coronavirus-standby |accessdate=20 March 2020 |agency=Forces.net |date=19 March 2020}}</ref> The names of two military operations to tackle the Coronavirus outbreak were reported as being Operation Rescript and Operation Broadshare \u2014 Rescript being focused within the United Kingdom, whilst Broadshare focused on activities overseas.<ref name=\"info1\"/>\n\nAnother possible outcome is the deployment of over 11,000 trained medical personnel from the armed forces into the NHS system to aid in the effort to fight the virus and relieve pressure on NHS staff.

If the evenings of each episode were joined with the morning of the respective preceding episode together as a day, they would form seven consecutive days, which may not necessarily be the case.{{Clarify|date=October 2015}}\n\n===Prologue===\n''1st Day Sequence'':\nA helicopter transports a statue of Christ over an ancient Roman aqueduct outside Rome while a second, Marcello Rubini's news helicopter, follows it into the city. The news helicopter is momentarily sidetracked by a group of bikini-clad women sunbathing on the rooftop of a high-rise apartment building. Hovering above, Marcello uses gestures to elicit phone numbers from them but fails in his attempt then shrugs and continues on following the statue into [[Saint Peter's Square]].\n\n===Episode 1===\n''1st Night Sequence'': Marcello meets Maddalena by chance in an exclusive nightclub. A beautiful and wealthy heiress, Maddalena is tired of Rome and constantly in search of new sensations while Marcello finds Rome suits him as a jungle he can hide in. They make love in the bedroom of a prostitute to whom they had given a ride home in Maddalena's Cadillac.\n\n''1st Dawn Sequence'': Marcello returns to his apartment at dawn to find that his fianc\u00e9e, Emma, has overdosed. On the way to the hospital, he declares his everlasting love to her and again as she lies in a semiconscious state in the emergency room. While waiting frantically for her recovery, however, he tries to make a phone call to Maddalena.\n\n===Episode 2===\n''2nd Day Sequence'': That day, he goes on assignment for the arrival of Sylvia, a famous Swedish-American actress, at [[Rome Ciampino Airport|Ciampino airport]] where she is met by a horde of news reporters.\n\nDuring Sylvia's press conference, Marcello calls home to ensure Emma has taken her medication while reassuring her that he is not alone with Sylvia. After the film star confidently replies to the barrage of journalists' questions, her boyfriend Robert ([[Lex Barker]]) enters the room late and drunk.  To Sylvia's producer, Marcello casually recommends that Sylvia be taken on a tour of St Peter's.\n\nInside St Peter's dome, a news reporter complains that Sylvia is \"an elevator\" because none of them can match her energetic climb up the numerous flights of stairs. Inspired, Marcello maneuvers forward to be alone with her when they finally reach the balcony overlooking [[St. Peter's Square]].\n\n''2nd Night Sequence'': That evening, the infatuated Marcello dances with Sylvia in the [[Baths of Caracalla]]. Sylvia's natural sensuality triggers raucous partying while Robert, her bored fianc\u00e9, draws caricatures and reads a newspaper. His humiliating remark to her causes Sylvia to leave the group, eagerly followed by Marcello and his paparazzi colleagues. Finding themselves alone, Marcello and Sylvia spend the rest of the evening in the alleys of Rome where they wade into the [[Trevi Fountain]].\n\n''2nd Dawn Sequence'': Like a magic spell that has suddenly been broken, dawn arrives at the very moment Sylvia playfully \"anoints\" Marcello's head with fountain water. They drive back to Sylvia's hotel to find an enraged Robert waiting for her in his car. Robert slaps Sylvia, orders her to go to bed, and then assaults Marcello who takes it in stride.\n\n===Episode 3a===\n''3rd Day Sequence'': Marcello meets Steiner, his distinguished intellectual friend, inside a church playing [[Bach]] on the organ. Steiner shows off his book of [[Sanskrit]] grammar. The two continue playing the piano, even offering up some jazz pieces for the watching priest.\n\n===Episode 4===\n''3rd Day Sequence'': Late afternoon, Marcello, his photographer friend Paparazzo, and Emma drive to the outskirts of Rome to cover the story of the purported sighting of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Madonna]] by two children. Although the Catholic Church is officially skeptical, a huge crowd of devotees and reporters gathers at the site.\n\n''3rd Night Sequence'': That night, the event is broadcast over Italian radio and television. Blindly following the two children from corner to corner in a downpour, the crowd tears a small tree apart for its branches and leaves said to have sheltered the Madonna. Meanwhile, Emma prays to the [[Virgin Mary]] to be given sole possession of Marcello's heart.\n\n''3rd Dawn Sequence'': The gathering ends at dawn with the crowd mourning a sick child, a pilgrim brought by his mother to be healed, but trampled to death in the melee.\n\n===Episode 3b===\n''4th Night Sequence'': One evening, Marcello and Emma attend a gathering at Steiner's luxurious home where they are introduced to a group of intellectuals who recite poetry, strum the guitar, offer philosophical ideas, and listen to sounds of nature recorded on tape. An American woman, whose poetry Marcello has read and admired, recommends that Marcello avoid the \"prisons\" of commitment: \"Stay free, available, like me.  Never get married.  Never choose.  Even in love, it's better to be chosen.\" Emma appears enchanted with Steiner's home and children, telling Marcello that one day he will have a home like Steiner's, but he turns away moodily.\n\nOutside on the terrace, Marcello confesses to Steiner his admiration for all he stands for, but Steiner admits he is torn between the security that a materialistic life affords and his longing for a more spiritual albeit insecure way of life. Steiner philosophizes about the need for love in the world and fears what his children may grow up to face one day.\n\n===Intermezzo===\n''5th Day Sequence'': Marcello spends the afternoon working on his novel at a seaside restaurant where he meets Paola, a young waitress from Perugia playing [[Perez Prado]]'s cha-cha \u201c[[Patricia (Perez Prado song)|Patricia]]\u201d on the jukebox and then humming its tune. He asks her if she has a boyfriend, then describes her as an angel in Umbrian paintings.\n\n===Episode 5===\n''5th Night Sequence'': Marcello meets his father (Annibale Ninchi) visiting Rome on the [[Via Veneto]]. With Paparazzo, they go to the Cha-Cha-Cha Club where Marcello introduces his father to Fanny, a beautiful dancer and one of his past girlfriends (he had promised to get her picture in the paper, but failed to do it). Fanny takes a liking to his father. Marcello tells Paparazzo that as a child he had never seen much of his father, who would spend weeks away from home. Fanny invites Marcello's father back to her flat, and two other dancers invite the two younger men to go with them.  Marcello leaves the others when they get to the dancers' neighborhood. Fanny comes out of her house, upset that Marcello's father has become ill.\n\n''4th Dawn Sequence'': Marcello's father has suffered what seems to be a mild heart attack.  Marcello wants him to stay with him in Rome so they can get to know each other, but his father, weakened, wants to go home and gets in a taxi to catch the first train home.  He leaves Marcello forlorn, on the street, watching the taxi leave.\n\n===Episode 6===\n''6th Night Sequence'': Marcello, [[Nico]], and other friends met on the Via Veneto are driven to a castle owned by aristocrats at [[Bassano di Sutri]] outside Rome. There is already a party long in progress, and the party-goers are bleary-eyed and intoxicated.  By chance, Marcello meets Maddalena again. The two of them explore a suite of ruins annexed to the castle. Maddalena seats Marcello in a vast room and then closets herself in another room connected by an echo chamber. As a disembodied voice, Maddalena asks him to marry her; Marcello professes his love for her, avoiding answering her proposal.  Another man kisses and embraces Maddalena, who loses interest in Marcello. He rejoins the group, and eventually spends the night with Jane, an American artist and heiress.\n\n''5th Dawn Sequence'': Burnt out and bleary-eyed, the group returns at dawn to the main section of the castle, to be met by the matriarch of the castle, who is on her way to mass, accompanied by priests in a procession.\n\n===Episode 3c===\n''7th Night Sequence'': Marcello and Emma are alone in his sports car on an isolated road. Emma starts an argument by professing her love, and tries to get out of the car; Marcello pleads with her not to get out.  Emma says that Marcello will never find another woman who loves him the way she does. Marcello becomes enraged, telling her that he cannot live with her smothering, maternal love.  He now wants her to get out of the car, but she refuses.  With some violence (a bite from her and a slap from him), he throws her out of the car and drives off, leaving her alone on a deserted road at night. Hours later, Emma hears his car approaching as she picks flowers by the roadside. She gets into the car with neither of them saying a word.\n\n''6th Dawn Sequence'': Marcello and Emma are asleep in bed, tenderly intertwined; Marcello receives a phone call. He rushes to the Steiners' apartment and learns that Steiner has killed his two children and himself.\n\n''6th Day Sequence'': After waiting with the police for Steiner's wife to return home, he meets her outside to break the terrible news while paparazzi swarm around her snapping pictures.\n\n===Episode 7===\n''8th Night Sequence'': An unspecified amount of time later, an older Marcello\u2014now with gray in his hair\u2014and a group of partygoers break into a [[Fregene]] beach house owned by Riccardo, a friend of Marcello's. Many of the men are [[homosexual]]. To celebrate her recent divorce from Riccardo, Nadia performs a [[striptease]] to [[Perez Prado]]'s cha-cha \u201c[[Patricia (Perez Prado song)|Patricia]]\u201d. The drunken Marcello attempts to provoke the other partygoers into an orgy. However, their inebriation causes the party to descend into mayhem with Marcello throwing pillow feathers around the room as he rides a young woman crawling on her hands and knees. Riccardo shows up at the house and angrily tells the partiers to leave.\n\n===Epilogue===\n''7th Dawn Sequence'': The party proceeds to the beach at dawn where they find a modern-day [[leviathan]], a bloated, stingray-like creature, caught in the fishermen's nets.{{efn|The fish is not specified in the film script nor identified by critics or biographers. Set designer Piero Gherardi described his creation as \"a kind of huge beast with blobs of plaster all over it like veal tripe. For eyes I gave it convex enlarging lenses\".<ref>Alpert, 141. Cf. Kezich, 204-205 and Bondanella, 144</ref>}} In his stupor, Marcello comments on how its eyes stare even in death.\n\n''7th Day Sequence'': Paola, the adolescent waitress from the seaside restaurant in Fregene, calls to Marcello from across an estuary but the words they exchange are lost on the wind, drowned out by the crash of the waves. He signals his inability to understand what she is saying or interpret her gestures. He shrugs and returns to the partygoers; one of the women joins him and they hold hands as they walk away from the beach. In a long final close-up, Paola waves to Marcello then stands watching him with an enigmatic smile.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n* [[Marcello Mastroianni]] as Marcello Rubini\n* [[Anita Ekberg]] as Sylvia\n* [[Anouk Aim\u00e9e]] as Maddalena\n* [[Yvonne Furneaux]] as Emma\n* [[Lex Barker]] as Robert, Sylvia's fianc\u00e9.\n* [[Magali No\u00ebl]] as Fanny\n{{col-3}}\n* [[Alain Cuny]] as Steiner\n* [[Nadia Gray]] as Nadia\n* [[Annibale Ninchi]] as Marcello's father\n* [[Walter Santesso]] as Paparazzo\n* [[Valeria Ciangottini]] as Paola\n* [[Riccardo Garrone (actor)|Riccardo Garrone]] as Riccardo\n{{col-3}}\n* [[Ida Galli]] as Debutante of the Year\n* Audrey McDonald as Jane\n* Gloria Jones as Gloria\n* Alain Dijon as Frankie Stout\n* [[Enzo Cerusico]] as Newspaper photographer\n* [[Nico]] as Nico\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Costumes===\nIn various interviews, Fellini said that the film's initial inspiration was the fashionable ladies' sack dress because of what the dress could hide beneath it.<ref>Pettigrew, 57.</ref> Brunello Rondi, Fellini's co-screenwriter and long-time collaborator, confirmed this view explaining that \"the fashion of women's sack dresses which possessed that sense of luxurious butterflying out around a body that might be physically beautiful but not morally so; these sack dresses struck Fellini because they rendered a woman very gorgeous who could, instead, be a skeleton of squalor and solitude inside.\"<ref>Bondanella, Peter, ''The Cinema of Federico Fellini'', 134</ref>\n\n===Writing===\nCredit for the creation of Steiner, the intellectual who commits suicide after shooting his two children, goes to co-screenwriter [[Tullio Pinelli]].

Marcello faces the existential struggle of having to choose between two lives, depicted by journalism and literature. Marcello leads a lifestyle of excess, fame and pleasure amongst Rome's thriving popular culture, depicting the confusion and frequency with which Marcello gets distracted by women and power. A more sensitive Marcello aspires to become a writer, of leading an intellectual life amongst the elites, the poets, writers and philosophers of the time. Marcello eventually chooses neither journalism, nor literature. Thematically he opted for the life of excess and popularity by officially becoming a publicity agent.\n\nThe theme of the film \"is predominantly [[caf\u00e9 society]], the diverse and glittery world rebuilt upon the ruins and poverty\" of the Italian postwar period.<ref name=\"Kezich, 203\"/> In the opening sequence, a plaster statue of [[Christ|Jesus]] the Labourer suspended by cables from a helicopter, flies past the ruins of an ancient Roman aqueduct.{{efn|The aqueduct can be seen from the railway south of [[Roma Termini railway station|Termini]] station in Rome or by visiting the [[Parco degli Acquedotti]].}} The statue is being taken to the Pope at the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. Journalist Marcello and a photographer named Paparazzo follow in a second helicopter. The symbolism of Jesus, arms outstretched as if blessing all of Rome as it flies overhead, is soon replaced by the profane life and neo-modern architecture of the \"new\" Rome, founded on the economic miracle of the late 1950s. (Much of this was filmed in [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] or in [[EUR (Rome)|EUR]], the Mussolini-style area south of Rome.) The delivery of the statue is the first of many scenes placing religious icons in the midst of characters demonstrating their \"modern\" morality, influenced by the booming economy and the emerging mass-consumer life.\n\n===Seven episodes===\nThe most common interpretation of the film is a mosaic, its parts linked by the protagonist, Marcello Rubini, a journalist.<ref>Bondanella, ''The Cinema of Federico Fellini'', 143</ref> The seven episodes are:\n\n# Marcello's evening with the heiress Maddalena ([[Anouk Aim\u00e9e]])\n# His long, frustrating night with the American actress Sylvia ([[Anita Ekberg]]) that ends in the Trevi fountain at dawn\n# His reunion with the intellectual Steiner ([[Alain Cuny]]) their relationship is divided into three sequences spread over the film: a) the encounter, b) Steiner's party and c) Steiner's tragedy\n# The fake miracle\n# His father's visit/Steiner's Party\n# The aristocrat's party/Steiner's tragedy\n# The \"[[orgy]]\" at the beach house<ref>\"At a villa on the coast near Fregene, Marcello presides over what passed for an \"orgy\" in 1959.\" Bondanella, 144</ref>\n\nInterrupting the seven episodes is the restaurant sequence with the angelic Paola; they are framed by a prologue (Jesus over Rome) and epilogue (the monster fish) giving the film its innovative and symmetrically symbolic structure.<ref name=\"Kezich, 203\"/> The evocations are: seven deadly sins, seven sacraments, seven virtues, seven days of creation. Other critics disagree, Peter Bondanella argues that \"any critic of ''La Dolce Vita'' not mesmerized by the magic number seven will find it almost impossible to organize the numerous sequences on a strictly numerological basis\".<ref>Bondanella, ''The Cinema of Federico Fellini'', 145</ref>\n\n===An aesthetic of disparity===\nThe critic Robert Richardson suggests that the originality of ''La Dolce Vita'' lies in a new form of film narrative that mines \"an aesthetic of disparity\".<ref>Richardson, Robert, 'Waste Lands: The Breakdown of Order' in Bondanella (ed.), ''Federico Fellini: Essays in Criticism'', 111</ref> Abandoning traditional plot and conventional \"character development\", Fellini and co-screenwriters [[Ennio Flaiano]] and [[Tullio Pinelli]] forged a cinematic narrative that rejected continuity, unnecessary explanations and narrative logic in favour of seven non-linear encounters between Marcello, a kind of Dantesque Pilgrim and an underworld of 120 characters. The encounters build up a cumulative impression on the viewer that finds resolution in an \"overpowering sense of the disparity between what life has been or could be, and what it actually is\".<ref>Richardson, 'Waste Lands: The Breakdown of Order', 111.</ref>\n\nIn a device used earlier in his films, Fellini orders the disparate succession of sequences as movements from evening to dawn. Also employed as an ordering device is the image of a downward spiral that Marcello sets in motion when descending the first of several staircases (including ladders) that open and close episodes. The upshot is that the film's aesthetic form, rather than its content, embodies the theme of Rome as a moral wasteland.\n\n==Critical reception==\nWriting for ''[[L'Espresso]]'', the Italian novelist [[Alberto Moravia]] highlighted the film's variations in tone,\n\n{{quote|Highly expressive throughout, Fellini seems to change the tone according to the subject matter of each episode, ranging from [[expressionist]] caricature to pure [[Neorealism (art)|neo-realism]]. In general, the tendency to caricature is greater the more severe the film's moral judgement although this is never totally contemptuous, there being always a touch of complacence and participation, as in the final orgy scene or the episode at the aristocrats' castle outside Rome, the latter being particularly effective for its descriptive acuteness and narrative rhythm.<ref>Moravia's review first published in ''L'Espresso'' (Rome), 14 February 1960. Fava and Vigano, p. 104</ref>}}\n\nIn ''Filmcritica XI'', Italian poet and film director [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] argued that \"''La Dolce Vita'' was too important to be discussed as one would normally discuss a film.\n\n{{quote|Though not as great as [[Charlie Chaplin|Chaplin]], [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]] or [[Kenji Mizoguchi|Mizoguchi]], Fellini is unquestionably an author rather than a director. The film is therefore his and his alone... The camera moves and fixes the image in such a way as to create a sort of diaphragm around each object, thus making the object\u2019s relationship to the world appear as irrational and magical. As each new episode begins, the camera is already in motion using complicated movements. Frequently, however, these sinuous movements are brutally punctuated by a very simple documentary shot, like a quotation written in everyday language.<ref>Pasolini's review first published in ''Filmcritica XI'' (Rome), February 1960. In Fava and Vigano, 104\u2013105</ref>}}\n\nJacques Doniol-Valcroze, film critic and co-founder of ''[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]]'', felt that\n\n{{quote|\"what ''La Dolce Vita'' lacks is the structure of a masterpiece. In fact, the film has no proper structure: it is a succession of cinematic moments, some more convincing than others\u2026 In the face of criticism, ''La Dolce Vita'' disintegrates, leaving behind little more than a sequence of events with no common denominator linking them into a meaningful whole\".<ref>Doniol-Valcroze's review first published in ''France observateur'' (Paris), 19 May 1960. In Fava and Vigano, p. 104</ref>}}\n\n''[[The New York Times]]'' film critic [[Bosley Crowther]] praised Fellini\u2019s\n\n{{quote|brilliantly graphic estimation of a whole swath of society in sad decay and, eventually, a withering commentary on the tragedy of the over-civilized\u2026 Fellini is nothing if not fertile, fierce and urbane in calculating the social scene around him and packing it onto the screen. He has an uncanny eye for finding the offbeat and grotesque incident, the gross and bizarre occurrence that exposes a glaring irony. He has, too, a splendid sense of balance and a deliciously sardonic wit that not only guided his cameras but also affected the writing of the script. In sum, it is an awesome picture, licentious in content but moral and vastly sophisticated in its attitude and what it says.<ref>Crowther\u2019s review first published in ''The New York Times'', 20 April 1961.

When I saw \"La Dolce Vita\" in 1960, I was an adolescent for whom \"the sweet life\" represented everything I dreamed of: sin, exotic European glamour, the weary romance of the cynical newspaperman. When I saw it again, around 1970, I was living in a version of Marcello's world; Chicago's North Avenue was not the Via Veneto, but at 3 a.m. the denizens were just as colorful, and I was about Marcello's age. When I saw the movie around 1980, Marcello was the same age, but I was 10 years older, had stopped drinking, and saw him not as a role model but as a victim, condemned to an endless search for happiness that could never be found, not that way. By 1991, when I analyzed the film a frame at a time at the University of Colorado, Marcello seemed younger still, and while I had once admired and then criticized him, now I pitied and loved him. And when I saw the movie right after Mastroianni died, I thought that Fellini and Marcello had taken a moment of discovery and made it immortal.<ref name=\"Ebert-Great Movies\">{{cite web|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=La Dolce Vita Movie Review & Film Summary (1960)|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-la-dolce-vita-1960|publisher=RogerEbert.com|accessdate=28 May 2016|date=5 January 1997|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601150749/http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-la-dolce-vita-1960|archivedate=1 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>}}\n\nReview aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that from 65 reviews, 95% were positive; the consensus states: \"An epic, breathtakingly stylish cinematic landmark, ''La Dolce Vita'' remains riveting in spite of\u2014or perhaps because of\u2014its sprawling length\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dolce_vita | title=La Dolce Vita | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher=[[Flixster]] | accessdate=15 January 2015 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103171633/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dolce_vita/ | archivedate=3 January 2015 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a 95/100 rating based on 13 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/la-dolce-vita | title=La Dolce Vita | work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | accessdate=15 January 2015 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120032456/http://www.metacritic.com/movie/la-dolce-vita | archivedate=20 January 2015 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n===Box office===\nThe film was a big hit in Europe with 13,617,148 admissions in Italy and 2,956,094 admissions in France.<ref name=admissions>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpbox-office.com/fichfilm.php?id=13051|title=La Dolce Vita (1960)- JPBox-Office|last=JP|website=www.jpbox-office.com|accessdate=5 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828122140/http://jpbox-office.com/fichfilm.php?id=13051|archivedate=28 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The film had the [[List of highest-grossing films in Italy#Most admissions for Italian productions|second most admissions for an Italian film]] behind ''[[War and Peace (1956 film)|War and Peace]]'' and was one of the [[List of highest-grossing films in Italy#Most admissions|top 10 most watched films in Italy]].\n\nThe film earned $6 million in rentals in the United States and Canada in its original release<ref>{{cite magazine|title=All-Time Top Grossers|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=8 January 1964|page=69}}</ref> and was the highest-grossing foreign language film at the US box office.<ref name=Top>{{cite magazine|title=Can 'Curious' U.S. Gross Top $7,500,000 'Dolce'?|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=23 April 1969|page=1}}</ref> The film was re-released in North America in 1966 by [[American International Pictures]] and earned $1.5 million in rentals.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Big Rental Pictures of 1966|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=4 January 1967|page=8}}</ref> The total gross was $19,516,348.<ref name=gross/>\n\n===Censorship===\nPerceived by the [[Catholic Church]] as a parody of the second coming of [[Jesus]], the opening scene and the film were condemned by the [[Holy See|Vatican]] newspaper ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' in 1960.<ref>Kezich, 209</ref> Subject to widespread censorship, the film was banned in Spain, until the death of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] in 1975.<ref name=\"French\"/> [[Umberto Tupini]], the Minister of Culture of the [[Fernando Tambroni|Tambroni government]] censored it and other \"shameful films\".

Bondanella 1994, p. 143 and Kezich, p. 203</ref> the film can be divided into a [[prologue]], seven major episodes interrupted by an intermezzo, and an [[epilogue]] (see also [[#Seven principal episodes|Structure, below]]). If the evenings of each episode were joined with the morning of the respective preceding episode together as a day, they would form seven consecutive days, which may not necessarily be the case.{{Clarify|date=October 2015}}\n\n===Prologue===\n''1st Day Sequence'':\nA helicopter transports a statue of Christ over an ancient Roman aqueduct outside Rome while a second, Marcello Rubini's news helicopter, follows it into the city. The news helicopter is momentarily sidetracked by a group of bikini-clad women sunbathing on the rooftop of a high-rise apartment building. Hovering above, Marcello uses gestures to elicit phone numbers from them but fails in his attempt then shrugs and continues on following the statue into [[Saint Peter's Square]].\n\n===Episode 1===\n''1st Night Sequence'': Marcello meets Maddalena by chance in an exclusive nightclub. A beautiful and wealthy heiress, Maddalena is tired of Rome and constantly in search of new sensations while Marcello finds Rome suits him as a jungle he can hide in. They make love in the bedroom of a prostitute to whom they had given a ride home in Maddalena's Cadillac.\n\n''1st Dawn Sequence'': Marcello returns to his apartment at dawn to find that his fianc\u00e9e, Emma, has overdosed. On the way to the hospital, he declares his everlasting love to her and again as she lies in a semiconscious state in the emergency room. While waiting frantically for her recovery, however, he tries to make a phone call to Maddalena.\n\n===Episode 2===\n''2nd Day Sequence'': That day, he goes on assignment for the arrival of Sylvia, a famous Swedish-American actress, at [[Rome Ciampino Airport|Ciampino airport]] where she is met by a horde of news reporters.\n\nDuring Sylvia's press conference, Marcello calls home to ensure Emma has taken her medication while reassuring her that he is not alone with Sylvia. After the film star confidently replies to the barrage of journalists' questions, her boyfriend Robert ([[Lex Barker]]) enters the room late and drunk.  To Sylvia's producer, Marcello casually recommends that Sylvia be taken on a tour of St Peter's.\n\nInside St Peter's dome, a news reporter complains that Sylvia is \"an elevator\" because none of them can match her energetic climb up the numerous flights of stairs. Inspired, Marcello maneuvers forward to be alone with her when they finally reach the balcony overlooking [[St. Peter's Square]].\n\n''2nd Night Sequence'': That evening, the infatuated Marcello dances with Sylvia in the [[Baths of Caracalla]]. Sylvia's natural sensuality triggers raucous partying while Robert, her bored fianc\u00e9, draws caricatures and reads a newspaper. His humiliating remark to her causes Sylvia to leave the group, eagerly followed by Marcello and his paparazzi colleagues. Finding themselves alone, Marcello and Sylvia spend the rest of the evening in the alleys of Rome where they wade into the [[Trevi Fountain]].\n\n''2nd Dawn Sequence'': Like a magic spell that has suddenly been broken, dawn arrives at the very moment Sylvia playfully \"anoints\" Marcello's head with fountain water. They drive back to Sylvia's hotel to find an enraged Robert waiting for her in his car. Robert slaps Sylvia, orders her to go to bed, and then assaults Marcello who takes it in stride.\n\n===Episode 3a===\n''3rd Day Sequence'': Marcello meets Steiner, his distinguished intellectual friend, inside a church playing [[Bach]] on the organ. Steiner shows off his book of [[Sanskrit]] grammar. The two continue playing the piano, even offering up some jazz pieces for the watching priest.\n\n===Episode 4===\n''3rd Day Sequence'': Late afternoon, Marcello, his photographer friend Paparazzo, and Emma drive to the outskirts of Rome to cover the story of the purported sighting of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Madonna]] by two children. Although the Catholic Church is officially skeptical, a huge crowd of devotees and reporters gathers at the site.\n\n''3rd Night Sequence'': That night, the event is broadcast over Italian radio and television. Blindly following the two children from corner to corner in a downpour, the crowd tears a small tree apart for its branches and leaves said to have sheltered the Madonna. Meanwhile, Emma prays to the [[Virgin Mary]] to be given sole possession of Marcello's heart.\n\n''3rd Dawn Sequence'': The gathering ends at dawn with the crowd mourning a sick child, a pilgrim brought by his mother to be healed, but trampled to death in the melee.\n\n===Episode 3b===\n''4th Night Sequence'': One evening, Marcello and Emma attend a gathering at Steiner's luxurious home where they are introduced to a group of intellectuals who recite poetry, strum the guitar, offer philosophical ideas, and listen to sounds of nature recorded on tape. An American woman, whose poetry Marcello has read and admired, recommends that Marcello avoid the \"prisons\" of commitment: \"Stay free, available, like me.  Never get married.  Never choose.  Even in love, it's better to be chosen.\" Emma appears enchanted with Steiner's home and children, telling Marcello that one day he will have a home like Steiner's, but he turns away moodily.\n\nOutside on the terrace, Marcello confesses to Steiner his admiration for all he stands for, but Steiner admits he is torn between the security that a materialistic life affords and his longing for a more spiritual albeit insecure way of life. Steiner philosophizes about the need for love in the world and fears what his children may grow up to face one day.\n\n===Intermezzo===\n''5th Day Sequence'': Marcello spends the afternoon working on his novel at a seaside restaurant where he meets Paola, a young waitress from Perugia playing [[Perez Prado]]'s cha-cha \u201c[[Patricia (Perez Prado song)|Patricia]]\u201d on the jukebox and then humming its tune. He asks her if she has a boyfriend, then describes her as an angel in Umbrian paintings.\n\n===Episode 5===\n''5th Night Sequence'': Marcello meets his father (Annibale Ninchi) visiting Rome on the [[Via Veneto]]. With Paparazzo, they go to the Cha-Cha-Cha Club where Marcello introduces his father to Fanny, a beautiful dancer and one of his past girlfriends (he had promised to get her picture in the paper, but failed to do it). Fanny takes a liking to his father. Marcello tells Paparazzo that as a child he had never seen much of his father, who would spend weeks away from home. Fanny invites Marcello's father back to her flat, and two other dancers invite the two younger men to go with them.  Marcello leaves the others when they get to the dancers' neighborhood. Fanny comes out of her house, upset that Marcello's father has become ill.\n\n''4th Dawn Sequence'': Marcello's father has suffered what seems to be a mild heart attack.  Marcello wants him to stay with him in Rome so they can get to know each other, but his father, weakened, wants to go home and gets in a taxi to catch the first train home.  He leaves Marcello forlorn, on the street, watching the taxi leave.\n\n===Episode 6===\n''6th Night Sequence'': Marcello, [[Nico]], and other friends met on the Via Veneto are driven to a castle owned by aristocrats at [[Bassano di Sutri]] outside Rome. There is already a party long in progress, and the party-goers are bleary-eyed and intoxicated.  By chance, Marcello meets Maddalena again. The two of them explore a suite of ruins annexed to the castle. Maddalena seats Marcello in a vast room and then closets herself in another room connected by an echo chamber. As a disembodied voice, Maddalena asks him to marry her; Marcello professes his love for her, avoiding answering her proposal.  Another man kisses and embraces Maddalena, who loses interest in Marcello. He rejoins the group, and eventually spends the night with Jane, an American artist and heiress.\n\n''5th Dawn Sequence'': Burnt out and bleary-eyed, the group returns at dawn to the main section of the castle, to be met by the matriarch of the castle, who is on her way to mass, accompanied by priests in a procession.\n\n===Episode 3c===\n''7th Night Sequence'': Marcello and Emma are alone in his sports car on an isolated road. Emma starts an argument by professing her love, and tries to get out of the car; Marcello pleads with her not to get out.  Emma says that Marcello will never find another woman who loves him the way she does. Marcello becomes enraged, telling her that he cannot live with her smothering, maternal love.  He now wants her to get out of the car, but she refuses.  With some violence (a bite from her and a slap from him), he throws her out of the car and drives off, leaving her alone on a deserted road at night. Hours later, Emma hears his car approaching as she picks flowers by the roadside. She gets into the car with neither of them saying a word.\n\n''6th Dawn Sequence'': Marcello and Emma are asleep in bed, tenderly intertwined; Marcello receives a phone call. He rushes to the Steiners' apartment and learns that Steiner has killed his two children and himself.\n\n''6th Day Sequence'': After waiting with the police for Steiner's wife to return home, he meets her outside to break the terrible news while paparazzi swarm around her snapping pictures.\n\n===Episode 7===\n''8th Night Sequence'': An unspecified amount of time later, an older Marcello\u2014now with gray in his hair\u2014and a group of partygoers break into a [[Fregene]] beach house owned by Riccardo, a friend of Marcello's. Many of the men are [[homosexual]]. To celebrate her recent divorce from Riccardo, Nadia performs a [[striptease]] to [[Perez Prado]]'s cha-cha \u201c[[Patricia (Perez Prado song)|Patricia]]\u201d. The drunken Marcello attempts to provoke the other partygoers into an orgy. However, their inebriation causes the party to descend into mayhem with Marcello throwing pillow feathers around the room as he rides a young woman crawling on her hands and knees. Riccardo shows up at the house and angrily tells the partiers to leave.\n\n===Epilogue===\n''7th Dawn Sequence'': The party proceeds to the beach at dawn where they find a modern-day [[leviathan]], a bloated, stingray-like creature, caught in the fishermen's nets.{{efn|The fish is not specified in the film script nor identified by critics or biographers. Set designer Piero Gherardi described his creation as \"a kind of huge beast with blobs of plaster all over it like veal tripe. For eyes I gave it convex enlarging lenses\".<ref>Alpert, 141. Cf. Kezich, 204-205 and Bondanella, 144</ref>}} In his stupor, Marcello comments on how its eyes stare even in death.\n\n''7th Day Sequence'': Paola, the adolescent waitress from the seaside restaurant in Fregene, calls to Marcello from across an estuary but the words they exchange are lost on the wind, drowned out by the crash of the waves. He signals his inability to understand what she is saying or interpret her gestures. He shrugs and returns to the partygoers; one of the women joins him and they hold hands as they walk away from the beach. In a long final close-up, Paola waves to Marcello then stands watching him with an enigmatic smile.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n* [[Marcello Mastroianni]] as Marcello Rubini\n* [[Anita Ekberg]] as Sylvia\n* [[Anouk Aim\u00e9e]] as Maddalena\n* [[Yvonne Furneaux]] as Emma\n* [[Lex Barker]] as Robert, Sylvia's fianc\u00e9.\n* [[Magali No\u00ebl]] as Fanny\n{{col-3}}\n* [[Alain Cuny]] as Steiner\n* [[Nadia Gray]] as Nadia\n* [[Annibale Ninchi]] as Marcello's father\n* [[Walter Santesso]] as Paparazzo\n* [[Valeria Ciangottini]] as Paola\n* [[Riccardo Garrone (actor)|Riccardo Garrone]] as Riccardo\n{{col-3}}\n* [[Ida Galli]] as Debutante of the Year\n* Audrey McDonald as Jane\n* Gloria Jones as Gloria\n* Alain Dijon as Frankie Stout\n* [[Enzo Cerusico]] as Newspaper photographer\n* [[Nico]] as Nico\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Costumes===\nIn various interviews, Fellini said that the film's initial inspiration was the fashionable ladies' sack dress because of what the dress could hide beneath it.<ref>Pettigrew, 57.</ref> Brunello Rondi, Fellini's co-screenwriter and long-time collaborator, confirmed this view explaining that \"the fashion of women's sack dresses which possessed that sense of luxurious butterflying out around a body that might be physically beautiful but not morally so; these sack dresses struck Fellini because they rendered a woman very gorgeous who could, instead, be a skeleton of squalor and solitude inside.\"<ref>Bondanella, Peter, ''The Cinema of Federico Fellini'', 134</ref>\n\n===Writing===\nCredit for the creation of Steiner, the intellectual who commits suicide after shooting his two children, goes to co-screenwriter [[Tullio Pinelli]]. Having gone to school with Italian novelist [[Cesare Pavese]], Pinelli had closely followed the writer's career and felt that his over-intellectualism had become emotionally sterile, leading to his suicide in a Turin hotel in 1950.<ref>Kezich, 198</ref> This idea of a \"burnt-out existence\" is carried over to Steiner in the party episode where the sounds of nature are not to be experienced first-hand by himself and his guests but in the virtual world of tape recordings.\n\nThe \u201cfalse miracle\u201d alludes to the 1958 investigation discounting the claims of two children to have been visited by Our Lady in a farm at Maratta Alta, near Terni.<ref>G.

Marcello faces the existential struggle of having to choose between two lives, depicted by journalism and literature. Marcello leads a lifestyle of excess, fame and pleasure amongst Rome's thriving popular culture, depicting the confusion and frequency with which Marcello gets distracted by women and power. A more sensitive Marcello aspires to become a writer, of leading an intellectual life amongst the elites, the poets, writers and philosophers of the time. Marcello eventually chooses neither journalism, nor literature. Thematically he opted for the life of excess and popularity by officially becoming a publicity agent.\n\nThe theme of the film \"is predominantly [[caf\u00e9 society]], the diverse and glittery world rebuilt upon the ruins and poverty\" of the Italian postwar period.<ref name=\"Kezich, 203\"/> In the opening sequence, a plaster statue of [[Christ|Jesus]] the Labourer suspended by cables from a helicopter, flies past the ruins of an ancient Roman aqueduct.{{efn|The aqueduct can be seen from the railway south of [[Roma Termini railway station|Termini]] station in Rome or by visiting the [[Parco degli Acquedotti]].}} The statue is being taken to the Pope at the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. Journalist Marcello and a photographer named Paparazzo follow in a second helicopter. The symbolism of Jesus, arms outstretched as if blessing all of Rome as it flies overhead, is soon replaced by the profane life and neo-modern architecture of the \"new\" Rome, founded on the economic miracle of the late 1950s. (Much of this was filmed in [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] or in [[EUR (Rome)|EUR]], the Mussolini-style area south of Rome.) The delivery of the statue is the first of many scenes placing religious icons in the midst of characters demonstrating their \"modern\" morality, influenced by the booming economy and the emerging mass-consumer life.\n\n===Seven episodes===\nThe most common interpretation of the film is a mosaic, its parts linked by the protagonist, Marcello Rubini, a journalist.<ref>Bondanella, ''The Cinema of Federico Fellini'', 143</ref> The seven episodes are:\n\n# Marcello's evening with the heiress Maddalena ([[Anouk Aim\u00e9e]])\n# His long, frustrating night with the American actress Sylvia ([[Anita Ekberg]]) that ends in the Trevi fountain at dawn\n# His reunion with the intellectual Steiner ([[Alain Cuny]]) their relationship is divided into three sequences spread over the film: a) the encounter, b) Steiner's party and c) Steiner's tragedy\n# The fake miracle\n# His father's visit/Steiner's Party\n# The aristocrat's party/Steiner's tragedy\n# The \"[[orgy]]\" at the beach house<ref>\"At a villa on the coast near Fregene, Marcello presides over what passed for an \"orgy\" in 1959.\" Bondanella, 144</ref>\n\nInterrupting the seven episodes is the restaurant sequence with the angelic Paola; they are framed by a prologue (Jesus over Rome) and epilogue (the monster fish) giving the film its innovative and symmetrically symbolic structure.<ref name=\"Kezich, 203\"/> The evocations are: seven deadly sins, seven sacraments, seven virtues, seven days of creation. Other critics disagree, Peter Bondanella argues that \"any critic of ''La Dolce Vita'' not mesmerized by the magic number seven will find it almost impossible to organize the numerous sequences on a strictly numerological basis\".<ref>Bondanella, ''The Cinema of Federico Fellini'', 145</ref>\n\n===An aesthetic of disparity===\nThe critic Robert Richardson suggests that the originality of ''La Dolce Vita'' lies in a new form of film narrative that mines \"an aesthetic of disparity\".<ref>Richardson, Robert, 'Waste Lands: The Breakdown of Order' in Bondanella (ed.), ''Federico Fellini: Essays in Criticism'', 111</ref> Abandoning traditional plot and conventional \"character development\", Fellini and co-screenwriters [[Ennio Flaiano]] and [[Tullio Pinelli]] forged a cinematic narrative that rejected continuity, unnecessary explanations and narrative logic in favour of seven non-linear encounters between Marcello, a kind of Dantesque Pilgrim and an underworld of 120 characters. The encounters build up a cumulative impression on the viewer that finds resolution in an \"overpowering sense of the disparity between what life has been or could be, and what it actually is\".<ref>Richardson, 'Waste Lands: The Breakdown of Order', 111.</ref>\n\nIn a device used earlier in his films, Fellini orders the disparate succession of sequences as movements from evening to dawn. Also employed as an ordering device is the image of a downward spiral that Marcello sets in motion when descending the first of several staircases (including ladders) that open and close episodes. The upshot is that the film's aesthetic form, rather than its content, embodies the theme of Rome as a moral wasteland.\n\n==Critical reception==\nWriting for ''[[L'Espresso]]'', the Italian novelist [[Alberto Moravia]] highlighted the film's variations in tone,\n\n{{quote|Highly expressive throughout, Fellini seems to change the tone according to the subject matter of each episode, ranging from [[expressionist]] caricature to pure [[Neorealism (art)|neo-realism]]. In general, the tendency to caricature is greater the more severe the film's moral judgement although this is never totally contemptuous, there being always a touch of complacence and participation, as in the final orgy scene or the episode at the aristocrats' castle outside Rome, the latter being particularly effective for its descriptive acuteness and narrative rhythm.<ref>Moravia's review first published in ''L'Espresso'' (Rome), 14 February 1960. Fava and Vigano, p. 104</ref>}}\n\nIn ''Filmcritica XI'', Italian poet and film director [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] argued that \"''La Dolce Vita'' was too important to be discussed as one would normally discuss a film.\n\n{{quote|Though not as great as [[Charlie Chaplin|Chaplin]], [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]] or [[Kenji Mizoguchi|Mizoguchi]], Fellini is unquestionably an author rather than a director. The film is therefore his and his alone... The camera moves and fixes the image in such a way as to create a sort of diaphragm around each object, thus making the object\u2019s relationship to the world appear as irrational and magical. As each new episode begins, the camera is already in motion using complicated movements. Frequently, however, these sinuous movements are brutally punctuated by a very simple documentary shot, like a quotation written in everyday language.<ref>Pasolini's review first published in ''Filmcritica XI'' (Rome), February 1960. In Fava and Vigano, 104\u2013105</ref>}}\n\nJacques Doniol-Valcroze, film critic and co-founder of ''[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]]'', felt that\n\n{{quote|\"what ''La Dolce Vita'' lacks is the structure of a masterpiece. In fact, the film has no proper structure: it is a succession of cinematic moments, some more convincing than others\u2026 In the face of criticism, ''La Dolce Vita'' disintegrates, leaving behind little more than a sequence of events with no common denominator linking them into a meaningful whole\".<ref>Doniol-Valcroze's review first published in ''France observateur'' (Paris), 19 May 1960. In Fava and Vigano, p. 104</ref>}}\n\n''[[The New York Times]]'' film critic [[Bosley Crowther]] praised Fellini\u2019s\n\n{{quote|brilliantly graphic estimation of a whole swath of society in sad decay and, eventually, a withering commentary on the tragedy of the over-civilized\u2026 Fellini is nothing if not fertile, fierce and urbane in calculating the social scene around him and packing it onto the screen. He has an uncanny eye for finding the offbeat and grotesque incident, the gross and bizarre occurrence that exposes a glaring irony. He has, too, a splendid sense of balance and a deliciously sardonic wit that not only guided his cameras but also affected the writing of the script. In sum, it is an awesome picture, licentious in content but moral and vastly sophisticated in its attitude and what it says.<ref>Crowther\u2019s review first published in ''The New York Times'', 20 April 1961.

When I saw \"La Dolce Vita\" in 1960, I was an adolescent for whom \"the sweet life\" represented everything I dreamed of: sin, exotic European glamour, the weary romance of the cynical newspaperman. When I saw it again, around 1970, I was living in a version of Marcello's world; Chicago's North Avenue was not the Via Veneto, but at 3 a.m. the denizens were just as colorful, and I was about Marcello's age. When I saw the movie around 1980, Marcello was the same age, but I was 10 years older, had stopped drinking, and saw him not as a role model but as a victim, condemned to an endless search for happiness that could never be found, not that way. By 1991, when I analyzed the film a frame at a time at the University of Colorado, Marcello seemed younger still, and while I had once admired and then criticized him, now I pitied and loved him. And when I saw the movie right after Mastroianni died, I thought that Fellini and Marcello had taken a moment of discovery and made it immortal.<ref name=\"Ebert-Great Movies\">{{cite web|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=La Dolce Vita Movie Review & Film Summary (1960)|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-la-dolce-vita-1960|publisher=RogerEbert.com|accessdate=28 May 2016|date=5 January 1997|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601150749/http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-la-dolce-vita-1960|archivedate=1 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>}}\n\nReview aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that from 65 reviews, 95% were positive; the consensus states: \"An epic, breathtakingly stylish cinematic landmark, ''La Dolce Vita'' remains riveting in spite of\u2014or perhaps because of\u2014its sprawling length\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dolce_vita | title=La Dolce Vita | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher=[[Flixster]] | accessdate=15 January 2015 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103171633/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dolce_vita/ | archivedate=3 January 2015 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a 95/100 rating based on 13 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/la-dolce-vita | title=La Dolce Vita | work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | accessdate=15 January 2015 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120032456/http://www.metacritic.com/movie/la-dolce-vita | archivedate=20 January 2015 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n===Box office===\nThe film was a big hit in Europe with 13,617,148 admissions in Italy and 2,956,094 admissions in France.<ref name=admissions>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpbox-office.com/fichfilm.php?id=13051|title=La Dolce Vita (1960)- JPBox-Office|last=JP|website=www.jpbox-office.com|accessdate=5 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828122140/http://jpbox-office.com/fichfilm.php?id=13051|archivedate=28 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The film had the [[List of highest-grossing films in Italy#Most admissions for Italian productions|second most admissions for an Italian film]] behind ''[[War and Peace (1956 film)|War and Peace]]'' and was one of the [[List of highest-grossing films in Italy#Most admissions|top 10 most watched films in Italy]].\n\nThe film earned $6 million in rentals in the United States and Canada in its original release<ref>{{cite magazine|title=All-Time Top Grossers|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=8 January 1964|page=69}}</ref> and was the highest-grossing foreign language film at the US box office.<ref name=Top>{{cite magazine|title=Can 'Curious' U.S. Gross Top $7,500,000 'Dolce'?|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=23 April 1969|page=1}}</ref> The film was re-released in North America in 1966 by [[American International Pictures]] and earned $1.5 million in rentals.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Big Rental Pictures of 1966|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=4 January 1967|page=8}}</ref> The total gross was $19,516,348.<ref name=gross/>\n\n===Censorship===\nPerceived by the [[Catholic Church]] as a parody of the second coming of [[Jesus]], the opening scene and the film were condemned by the [[Holy See|Vatican]] newspaper ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' in 1960.<ref>Kezich, 209</ref> Subject to widespread censorship, the film was banned in Spain, until the death of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] in 1975.<ref name=\"French\"/> [[Umberto Tupini]], the Minister of Culture of the [[Fernando Tambroni|Tambroni government]] censored it and other \"shameful films\".

The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] [[History of Egypt under the British|invaded and took control]] in 1882. In 1914 the Ottoman Empire connection was ended and Britain established a protectorate called the [[Sultanate of Egypt]].\n\n==History==\n\n=== Rise of Muhammad Ali ===\n{{main|Muhammad Ali's seizure of power}}\nUpon the conquest of the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Sultanate of Egypt]] by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1517, the country was governed as an Ottoman [[Egypt Eyalet|eyalet]] (province). The [[Ottoman Porte]] (government) was content to permit local rule to remain in the hands of the [[Mamluk]]s, the Egyptian military caste of [[Circassians|Circassian]], and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] origin who had held power in Egypt since the 13th century. Save for military expeditions to crush Mamluk Egyptian uprisings seeking to re-establish  \nthe independent Egyptian sultanate, the Ottomans largely ignored Egyptian affairs until the [[French invasion of Egypt (1798)|French invasion of Egypt]] in 1798.\n\nBetween 1799 and 1801, the Porte, working at times with France's main enemy, Great Britain, undertook various campaigns to restore Ottoman rule in Egypt. By August 1801, the remaining French forces of General Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Menou withdrew from Egypt.\n\nThe period between 1801 and 1805 was, effectively, a three-way civil war in Egypt between the Egyptian Mamluks, the Ottoman Turks, and troops the Ottoman Porte dispatched from [[Rumelia]] (the Empire's European province), under the command of [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]], to restore the Empire's authority.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the French, the Porte assigned [[Husrev Pasha]] as the new [[W\u0101li]] (governor) of Egypt, tasking him to kill or imprison the surviving Egyptian Mamluk [[bey]]s. Many of these were freed by or fled with the British, while others held [[Minya, Egypt|Minya]] between [[Upper Egypt|Upper]] and [[Lower Egypt]].\n\nAmid these disturbances, Husrev Pasha attempted to disband his Albanian [[bashi-bazouk]]s (soldiers) without pay. This led to rioting that drove Husrev Pasha from Cairo. During the ensuing turmoil, the Porte sent [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]] to Egypt.\n\nHowever, Muhammad Ali [[Muhammad Ali's seizure of power|seized control]] of Egypt, declaring himself ruler of Egypt and quickly consolidating an independent local powerbase. After repeated failed attempts to remove and kill him, in 1805, the Porte officially recognised Muhammad Ali as W\u0101li of Egypt. Demonstrating his grander ambitions, Muhammad Ali Pasha claimed for himself the higher title of Khedive (Viceroy), ruling the self-proclaimed (but not recognised) Khedivate of Egypt.  He murdered the remaining Mamluk beys in 1811, solidifying his own control of Egypt.  He is regarded as the founder of modern Egypt because of the dramatic reforms he instituted in the military, agricultural, economic and cultural spheres.\n\n===Reforms===\nDuring Muhammad Ali's absence in Arabia his representative at Cairo had completed the confiscation, begun in 1808, of almost all the lands belonging to private individuals, who were forced to accept instead inadequate pensions. By this revolutionary method of land nationalization Muhammad Ali became proprietor of nearly all the soil of Egypt, an iniquitous measure against which the [[Egyptians]] had no remedy.\n\nThe pasha also attempted to reorganize his troops on European lines, but this led to a formidable mutiny in Cairo. Muhammad Ali's life was endangered, and he sought refuge by night in the citadel, while the soldiery committed many acts of plunder. The revolt was reduced by presents to the chiefs of the insurgents, and Muhammad Ali ordered that the sufferers by the disturbances should receive compensation from the treasury. The project of the [[Nizam Gedid]] (New System) was, in consequence of this mutiny, abandoned for a time.\n\nWhile Ibrahim was engaged in the second Arabian campaign the pasha turned his attention to strengthening the Egyptian economy.  He created state monopolies over the chief products of the country.  He set up a number of factories and began digging in 1819 a new canal to Alexandria, called the [[Mahmoudiyah canal|Mahmudiya]] (after the reigning sultan of Turkey). The old canal had long fallen into decay, and the necessity of a safe channel between Alexandria and the [[Nile]] was much felt.  The conclusion in 1838 of a commercial treaty with Turkey, negotiated by Sir [[Henry Bulwer]] (Lord Darling), struck a deathblow to the system of monopolies, though the application of the treaty to Egypt was delayed for some years.\n\nAnother notable fact in the economic progress of the country was the development of the cultivation of [[cotton]] in the [[Nile Delta|Delta]] in 1822 and onwards. The cotton grown had been brought from the [[Sudan]] by [[Maho Bey]], and the organization of the new industry from which in a few years Muhammad Ali was enabled to extract considerable revenues.\n\nEfforts were made to promote education and the study of medicine. To European merchants, on whom he was dependent for the sale of his exports, Muhammad Ali showed much favor, and under his influence, the port of Alexandria again rose into importance. It was also under Muhammad Ali's encouragement that the overland transit of goods from Europe to [[India]] via Egypt was resumed.\n\n===Invasion of Libya and Sudan===\n{{Main|Egyptian invasion of Sudan 1820-24}}\nIn 1820 Muhammad Ali gave orders to commence the conquest of eastern [[Libya]]. He first sent an expedition westward (Feb. 1820) which conquered and annexed the [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]] oasis. Ali's intentions for Sudan was to extend his rule southward, to capture the valuable caravan trade bound for the [[Red Sea]], and to secure the rich [[gold]] mines which he believed to exist in [[Sennar]]. He also saw in the campaign a means of getting rid of his disaffected troops, and of obtaining a sufficient number of captives to form the nucleus of the new army.\n\nThe forces destined for this service were led by Ismail, the youngest son of Muhammad Ali.  They consisted of between 4000 and 5000 men, being Albanians, Turks and Egyptians.  They left Cairo in July 1820. [[Nubia]] at once submitted, the [[Shaigiya tribe]] immediately beyond the province of [[Dongola]] were defeated, the remnant of the Mamluks dispersed, and Sennar was reduced without a battle.\n\n[[Mahommed Bey]], the defterdar, with another force of about the same strength, was then sent by Muhammad Ali against [[Kordofan]] with like result, but not without a hard-fought engagement. In October 1822, Ismail, with his retinue, was burnt to death by Nimr, the [[Makk|mek (king)]] of [[Shendi]]; and the defterdar, a man infamous for his cruelty, assumed the command of those provinces, and exacted terrible retribution from the inhabitants. [[Khartoum]] was founded at this time, and in the following years the rule of the Egyptians was greatly extended and control of the Red Sea ports of [[Suakin]] and [[Massawa]] obtained.\n\n===Greek campaign===\n{{main|Greek War of Independence}}\nMuhammad Ali was fully conscious that the empire which he had so laboriously built up might at any time have to be defended by force of arms against his master Sultan [[Mahmud II]], whose whole policy had been directed to curbing the power of his too ambitious vassals, and who was under the influence of the personal enemies of the pasha of Egypt, notably of [[Husrev Pasha]], the [[grand vizier]], who had never forgiven his humiliation in Egypt in 1803.\n\nMahmud also was already planning reforms borrowed from the West, and Muhammad Ali, who had had plenty of opportunity of observing the superiority of European methods of warfare, was determined to anticipate the sultan in the creation of a fleet and an army on European lines, partly as a measure of precaution, partly as an instrument for the realization of yet wider schemes of ambition. Before the outbreak of the [[War of Greek Independence]] in 1821, he had already expended much time and energy in organizing a fleet and in training, under the supervision of French instructors, native officers and artificers; though it was not till 1829 that the opening of a dockyard and arsenal at Alexandria enabled him to build and equip his own vessels. By 1823, moreover, he had succeeded in carrying out the reorganization of his army on European lines, the turbulent Turkish and Albanian elements being replaced by Sudanese and ''[[fellah]]in''. The effectiveness of the new force was demonstrated in the suppression of an 1823 revolt of the Albanians in Cairo by six disciplined Sudanese regiments; after which Mehemet Ali was no more troubled with military mutinies.\n\nHis foresight was rewarded by the invitation of the sultan to help him in the task of subduing the Greek insurgents, offering as reward the pashaliks of the [[Morea]] and of Syria. Muhammad Ali had already, in 1821, been appointed by him governor of [[Crete]], which he had occupied with a small Egyptian force. In the autumn of 1824, a fleet of 60 Egyptian warships carrying a large force of 17,000 disciplined troops concentrated in [[Suda Bay]], and, in the following March, with Ibrahin as commander-in-chief landed in the [[Morea]].\n\nHis naval superiority wrested from the Greeks the command of a great deal of the sea, on which the fate of the insurrection ultimately depended, while on land the Greek irregular bands, having largely soundly beaten the Porte's troops, had finally met a worthy foe in Ibrahim's disciplined troops. The history of the events that led up to the [[battle of Navarino]] and the liberation of Greece is told elsewhere; the withdrawal of the Egyptians from the Morea was ultimately due to the action of Admiral Sir [[Edward Codrington]], who early in August 1828 appeared before Alexandria and induced the pasha, by no means sorry to have a reasonable excuse, by a threat of bombardment, to sign a convention undertaking to recall Ibrahim and his army. But for the action of European powers, it is suspected by many that the Ottoman Empire might have defeated the Greeks.\n\n=== Wars against the Turks ===\n{{main|Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War (1831\u201333)|Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War (1839\u201341)}}\nAlthough Muhammad Ali had only been granted the title of [[wali]], he proclaimed himself [[khedive]], or hereditary viceroy, early on during his rule.  The Ottoman government, although irritated, did nothing until Muhammad Ali [[First Turko-Egyptian War|invaded Ottoman-ruled Syria in 1831]].  The governorship of Syria had been promised him by the sultan, [[Mahmud II]], for his assistance during the [[Greek War of Independence]], but the title was not granted to him after the war.<ref name=\"infoplease1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/people/A0834351.html |title=Private Tutor |publisher=Infoplease.com |accessdate=31 October 2010}}</ref> This caused the Ottomans, allied with the British, to [[Second Turko-Egyptian War|counter-attack in 1839]].\n\nIn 1840, the British bombarded Beirut and an Anglo-Ottoman force landed and seized Acre.<ref name=\"country-data1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-4039.html |title=Egypt \u2013 Muhammad Ali, 1805\u201348 |publisher=Country-data.com |accessdate=31 October 2010}}</ref> The Egyptian army was forced to retreat back home, and Syria again became an Ottoman province.  As a result of the [[Convention of London (1840)]], Muhammad Ali gave up all conquered lands with the exception of the Sudan and was, in turn, granted the hereditary governorship of the Sudan.\n\n=== Muhammad Ali's successors ===\n{{main|Muhammad Ali Dynasty}}\nBy 1848, Muhammad Ali was old and senile enough for his tuberculosis-ridden son, [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim]], to demand his accession to the governorship.  The Ottoman sultan acceded to the demands, and Muhammad Ali was removed from power.  However, Ibrahim died of his disease months later, outlived by his father, who died in 1849.\n\nIbrahim was succeeded by his nephew [[Abbas I of Egypt|Abbas I]], who undid many of Muhammad Ali's accomplishments.  Abbas was assassinated by two of his slaves in 1854, and Muhammad Ali's fourth son, [[Sa'id of Egypt|Sa'id]], succeeded him.

In 1866 the polity occupied the [[Emirate of Harar]]. In 1867, the Ottoman sultan acknowledged Isma'il's use of the title [[khedive]]. In 1874, Ismail Pasha ordered the deputation of warships to capture Tadjoura whereafter for ten years, the Somali Coast Khedivate was established.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20130609002748/http://www.awdalpress.com/index/archives/16528</ref>\n\n===British occupation===\n{{main|British occupation of Egypt}}\n\nIn 1882 opposition to European control led to growing tension amongst native notables, the most dangerous opposition coming from the army. A large military demonstration in September 1881 forced the [[Tewfik Pasha|Khedive Tewfiq]] to dismiss his Prime Minister. In April 1882 France and Great Britain sent warships to [[Alexandria]] to bolster the Khedive amidst a turbulent climate, spreading fear of invasion throughout the country.\nBy June Egypt was in the hands of nationalists opposed to European domination of the country. A British naval bombardment of Alexandria had little effect on the opposition which led to the landing of a British expeditionary force at both ends of the [[Suez Canal]] in August 1882.  The British succeeded in defeating the Egyptian Army at Tel El Kebir in September and took control of the country putting Tewfiq back in control. The purpose of the invasion had been to restore political stability to Egypt under a government of the Khedive and international controls which were in place to streamline Egyptian financing since 1876.\n\nBritish occupation ended nominally with the deposition of the last ''khedive'' [[Abbas II of Egypt|Abbas II]] on 5 November 1914<ref name=\"Treaty\">[http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Treaty_of_Lausanne Article 17 of the Treaty of Lausanne (1923) regarding the new status of Egypt and Sudan, starting from 5 November 1914, when the Khedivate was abolished.]</ref> and the establishment of a [[Sultanate of Egypt|British protectorate]], with the installation of ''sultan'' [[Hussein Kamel of Egypt|Hussein Kamel]] on 19 December 1914.\n\n=== Sanctioned khedival rule (1867\u20131914) ===\n\n==== European influence ====\n\nBy Isma'il's reign, the Egyptian government, headed by the minister [[Nubar Pasha]], had become dependent on Britain and France for a healthy economy.  Isma'il attempted to end this European dominance, while at the same time pursuing an aggressive domestic policy.  Under Isma'il, 112 canals and 400 bridges were built in Egypt.<ref name=\"country-data2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-4044.html |title=Egypt \u2013 From Autonomy To Occupation: Ismail, Tawfiq, And The Urabi Revolt |publisher=Country-data.com |accessdate=31 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nBecause of his efforts to gain economic independence from the European powers, Isma'il became unpopular with many British and French diplomats, including [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer|Evelyn Baring]] and [[Alfred Milner]], who claimed that he was \"ruining Egypt.\"<ref name=\"country-data2\"/>\n\nIn 1869, the completion of the [[Suez Canal]] gave Britain a faster route to India.  This made Egypt increasingly reliant on Britain for both military and economic aid.  Isma'il made no effort to reconcile with the European powers, who pressured the Ottoman sultan into removing him from power.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n==== Tewfik and the loss of Sudan ====\n\nIsma'il was succeeded by his eldest son [[Tewfik Pasha|Tewfik]], who, unlike his younger brothers, had not been educated in Europe.  He pursued a policy of closer relations with Britain and France but his authority was undermined in a rebellion led by his war minister, [[Arabi Pasha]], in 1882.  Arabi took advantage of violent riots in [[Alexandria]] to seize control of the government and temporarily depose Tewfik.\n\nBritish naval forces shelled and captured Alexandria, and an expeditionary force under General Sir [[Garnet Wolseley]] was formed in England.  The British army landed in Egypt soon afterwards and defeated Arabi's army in the [[Battle of Tel el-Kebir]]. Arabi was tried for treason and sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted to exile.  After the revolt, the Egyptian army was reorganized on a British model and commanded by British officers.\n\nMeanwhile, a religious rebellion had broken out in the Sudan, led by [[Muhammad Ahmed]], who proclaimed himself the [[Mahdi]].  The [[Mahdist War|Mahdist]] rebels had seized the regional capital of [[Kordofan]] and annihilated two British-led expeditions sent to quell it.<ref name=\"heritage-history1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage-history.com/www/heritage.php?R_menu=OFF&Dir=wars&FileName=wars_soudan.php |title=Heritage History \u2013 Putting the \"Story\" back into History |publisher=Heritage-history.com |date=10 January 1904 |accessdate=31 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711164043/http://www.heritage-history.com/www/heritage.php?R_menu=OFF&Dir=wars&FileName=wars_soudan.php |archivedate=11 July 2011 }}</ref> The British soldier-adventurer [[Charles George Gordon]], an ex-governor of the Sudan, was sent to the Sudanese capital, [[Khartoum]], with orders to evacuate its minority of European and Egyptian inhabitants. Instead of evacuating the city, Gordon prepared for a siege and held out from 1884 to 1885.  However, Khartoum eventually fell, and he was killed.<ref name=\"heritage-history1\"/>\n\nThe British [[Gordon Relief Expedition]] was delayed by several battles and was thus unable to reach Khartoum and save Gordon.  The [[Siege of Khartoum|fall of Khartoum]] resulted in the proclamation of an [[Islamic state]], ruled over first by the Mahdi and then by his successor Khalifa [[Abdullahi]].\n\n==== Reconquest of the Sudan ====\n{{see also|History of Mahdist Sudan#Reconquest of Sudan|Anglo-Egyptian invasion of Sudan}}\nIn 1896, during the reign of Tewfik's son, [[Abbas II of Egypt|Abbas II]], a massive Anglo-Egyptian force, under the command of General [[Herbert Kitchener]], began the [[Mahdist War|reconquest of the Sudan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onwar.com/aced/data/sierra/sudan1896.htm |title=Britain Sudan Reconquest 1896\u20131899 |publisher=Onwar.com |date=16 December 2000 |accessdate=31 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111184806/http://www.onwar.com/aced/data/sierra/sudan1896.htm |archive-date=11 January 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Mahdists were defeated in the battles of [[Abu Hamid]] and [[Battle of Atbara|Atbara]].

Britain now removed the nominal role of Constantinople, proclaimed a [[Sultanate of Egypt]] and abolished the [[Khedive|Khedivate]] on 5 November 1914.<ref name=\"Treaty\"/> [[Abbas II of Egypt|Abbas II]], who supported the Central Powers and was in Vienna for a state visit, was deposed from the Khedivate throne in his absence by the enforcement of the British military authorities in Cairo and was banned from returning to Egypt.

The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] [[History of Egypt under the British|invaded and took control]] in 1882. In 1914 the Ottoman Empire connection was ended and Britain established a protectorate called the [[Sultanate of Egypt]].\n\n==History==\n\n=== Rise of Muhammad Ali ===\n{{main|Muhammad Ali's seizure of power}}\nUpon the conquest of the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Sultanate of Egypt]] by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1517, the country was governed as an Ottoman [[Egypt Eyalet|eyalet]] (province). The [[Ottoman Porte]] (government) was content to permit local rule to remain in the hands of the [[Mamluk]]s, the Egyptian military caste of [[Circassians|Circassian]], and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] origin who had held power in Egypt since the 13th century. Save for military expeditions to crush Mamluk Egyptian uprisings seeking to re-establish  \nthe independent Egyptian sultanate, the Ottomans largely ignored Egyptian affairs until the [[French invasion of Egypt (1798)|French invasion of Egypt]] in 1798.\n\nBetween 1799 and 1801, the Porte, working at times with France's main enemy, Great Britain, undertook various campaigns to restore Ottoman rule in Egypt. By August 1801, the remaining French forces of General Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Menou withdrew from Egypt.\n\nThe period between 1801 and 1805 was, effectively, a three-way civil war in Egypt between the Egyptian Mamluks, the Ottoman Turks, and troops the Ottoman Porte dispatched from [[Rumelia]] (the Empire's European province), under the command of [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]], to restore the Empire's authority.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the French, the Porte assigned [[Husrev Pasha]] as the new [[W\u0101li]] (governor) of Egypt, tasking him to kill or imprison the surviving Egyptian Mamluk [[bey]]s. Many of these were freed by or fled with the British, while others held [[Minya, Egypt|Minya]] between [[Upper Egypt|Upper]] and [[Lower Egypt]].\n\nAmid these disturbances, Husrev Pasha attempted to disband his Albanian [[bashi-bazouk]]s (soldiers) without pay. This led to rioting that drove Husrev Pasha from Cairo. During the ensuing turmoil, the Porte sent [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]] to Egypt.\n\nHowever, Muhammad Ali [[Muhammad Ali's seizure of power|seized control]] of Egypt, declaring himself ruler of Egypt and quickly consolidating an independent local powerbase. After repeated failed attempts to remove and kill him, in 1805, the Porte officially recognised Muhammad Ali as W\u0101li of Egypt. Demonstrating his grander ambitions, Muhammad Ali Pasha claimed for himself the higher title of Khedive (Viceroy), ruling the self-proclaimed (but not recognised) Khedivate of Egypt.  He murdered the remaining Mamluk beys in 1811, solidifying his own control of Egypt.  He is regarded as the founder of modern Egypt because of the dramatic reforms he instituted in the military, agricultural, economic and cultural spheres.\n\n===Reforms===\nDuring Muhammad Ali's absence in Arabia his representative at Cairo had completed the confiscation, begun in 1808, of almost all the lands belonging to private individuals, who were forced to accept instead inadequate pensions. By this revolutionary method of land nationalization Muhammad Ali became proprietor of nearly all the soil of Egypt, an iniquitous measure against which the [[Egyptians]] had no remedy.\n\nThe pasha also attempted to reorganize his troops on European lines, but this led to a formidable mutiny in Cairo. Muhammad Ali's life was endangered, and he sought refuge by night in the citadel, while the soldiery committed many acts of plunder. The revolt was reduced by presents to the chiefs of the insurgents, and Muhammad Ali ordered that the sufferers by the disturbances should receive compensation from the treasury. The project of the [[Nizam Gedid]] (New System) was, in consequence of this mutiny, abandoned for a time.\n\nWhile Ibrahim was engaged in the second Arabian campaign the pasha turned his attention to strengthening the Egyptian economy.  He created state monopolies over the chief products of the country.  He set up a number of factories and began digging in 1819 a new canal to Alexandria, called the [[Mahmoudiyah canal|Mahmudiya]] (after the reigning sultan of Turkey). The old canal had long fallen into decay, and the necessity of a safe channel between Alexandria and the [[Nile]] was much felt.  The conclusion in 1838 of a commercial treaty with Turkey, negotiated by Sir [[Henry Bulwer]] (Lord Darling), struck a deathblow to the system of monopolies, though the application of the treaty to Egypt was delayed for some years.\n\nAnother notable fact in the economic progress of the country was the development of the cultivation of [[cotton]] in the [[Nile Delta|Delta]] in 1822 and onwards. The cotton grown had been brought from the [[Sudan]] by [[Maho Bey]], and the organization of the new industry from which in a few years Muhammad Ali was enabled to extract considerable revenues.\n\nEfforts were made to promote education and the study of medicine. To European merchants, on whom he was dependent for the sale of his exports, Muhammad Ali showed much favor, and under his influence, the port of Alexandria again rose into importance. It was also under Muhammad Ali's encouragement that the overland transit of goods from Europe to [[India]] via Egypt was resumed.\n\n===Invasion of Libya and Sudan===\n{{Main|Egyptian invasion of Sudan 1820-24}}\nIn 1820 Muhammad Ali gave orders to commence the conquest of eastern [[Libya]]. He first sent an expedition westward (Feb. 1820) which conquered and annexed the [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]] oasis. Ali's intentions for Sudan was to extend his rule southward, to capture the valuable caravan trade bound for the [[Red Sea]], and to secure the rich [[gold]] mines which he believed to exist in [[Sennar]]. He also saw in the campaign a means of getting rid of his disaffected troops, and of obtaining a sufficient number of captives to form the nucleus of the new army.\n\nThe forces destined for this service were led by Ismail, the youngest son of Muhammad Ali.  They consisted of between 4000 and 5000 men, being Albanians, Turks and Egyptians.  They left Cairo in July 1820. [[Nubia]] at once submitted, the [[Shaigiya tribe]] immediately beyond the province of [[Dongola]] were defeated, the remnant of the Mamluks dispersed, and Sennar was reduced without a battle.\n\n[[Mahommed Bey]], the defterdar, with another force of about the same strength, was then sent by Muhammad Ali against [[Kordofan]] with like result, but not without a hard-fought engagement. In October 1822, Ismail, with his retinue, was burnt to death by Nimr, the [[Makk|mek (king)]] of [[Shendi]]; and the defterdar, a man infamous for his cruelty, assumed the command of those provinces, and exacted terrible retribution from the inhabitants. [[Khartoum]] was founded at this time, and in the following years the rule of the Egyptians was greatly extended and control of the Red Sea ports of [[Suakin]] and [[Massawa]] obtained.\n\n===Greek campaign===\n{{main|Greek War of Independence}}\nMuhammad Ali was fully conscious that the empire which he had so laboriously built up might at any time have to be defended by force of arms against his master Sultan [[Mahmud II]], whose whole policy had been directed to curbing the power of his too ambitious vassals, and who was under the influence of the personal enemies of the pasha of Egypt, notably of [[Husrev Pasha]], the [[grand vizier]], who had never forgiven his humiliation in Egypt in 1803.\n\nMahmud also was already planning reforms borrowed from the West, and Muhammad Ali, who had had plenty of opportunity of observing the superiority of European methods of warfare, was determined to anticipate the sultan in the creation of a fleet and an army on European lines, partly as a measure of precaution, partly as an instrument for the realization of yet wider schemes of ambition. Before the outbreak of the [[War of Greek Independence]] in 1821, he had already expended much time and energy in organizing a fleet and in training, under the supervision of French instructors, native officers and artificers; though it was not till 1829 that the opening of a dockyard and arsenal at Alexandria enabled him to build and equip his own vessels. By 1823, moreover, he had succeeded in carrying out the reorganization of his army on European lines, the turbulent Turkish and Albanian elements being replaced by Sudanese and ''[[fellah]]in''. The effectiveness of the new force was demonstrated in the suppression of an 1823 revolt of the Albanians in Cairo by six disciplined Sudanese regiments; after which Mehemet Ali was no more troubled with military mutinies.\n\nHis foresight was rewarded by the invitation of the sultan to help him in the task of subduing the Greek insurgents, offering as reward the pashaliks of the [[Morea]] and of Syria. Muhammad Ali had already, in 1821, been appointed by him governor of [[Crete]], which he had occupied with a small Egyptian force. In the autumn of 1824, a fleet of 60 Egyptian warships carrying a large force of 17,000 disciplined troops concentrated in [[Suda Bay]], and, in the following March, with Ibrahin as commander-in-chief landed in the [[Morea]].\n\nHis naval superiority wrested from the Greeks the command of a great deal of the sea, on which the fate of the insurrection ultimately depended, while on land the Greek irregular bands, having largely soundly beaten the Porte's troops, had finally met a worthy foe in Ibrahim's disciplined troops. The history of the events that led up to the [[battle of Navarino]] and the liberation of Greece is told elsewhere; the withdrawal of the Egyptians from the Morea was ultimately due to the action of Admiral Sir [[Edward Codrington]], who early in August 1828 appeared before Alexandria and induced the pasha, by no means sorry to have a reasonable excuse, by a threat of bombardment, to sign a convention undertaking to recall Ibrahim and his army. But for the action of European powers, it is suspected by many that the Ottoman Empire might have defeated the Greeks.\n\n=== Wars against the Turks ===\n{{main|Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War (1831\u201333)|Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War (1839\u201341)}}\nAlthough Muhammad Ali had only been granted the title of [[wali]], he proclaimed himself [[khedive]], or hereditary viceroy, early on during his rule.  The Ottoman government, although irritated, did nothing until Muhammad Ali [[First Turko-Egyptian War|invaded Ottoman-ruled Syria in 1831]].  The governorship of Syria had been promised him by the sultan, [[Mahmud II]], for his assistance during the [[Greek War of Independence]], but the title was not granted to him after the war.<ref name=\"infoplease1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/people/A0834351.html |title=Private Tutor |publisher=Infoplease.com |accessdate=31 October 2010}}</ref> This caused the Ottomans, allied with the British, to [[Second Turko-Egyptian War|counter-attack in 1839]].\n\nIn 1840, the British bombarded Beirut and an Anglo-Ottoman force landed and seized Acre.<ref name=\"country-data1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-4039.html |title=Egypt \u2013 Muhammad Ali, 1805\u201348 |publisher=Country-data.com |accessdate=31 October 2010}}</ref> The Egyptian army was forced to retreat back home, and Syria again became an Ottoman province.  As a result of the [[Convention of London (1840)]], Muhammad Ali gave up all conquered lands with the exception of the Sudan and was, in turn, granted the hereditary governorship of the Sudan.\n\n=== Muhammad Ali's successors ===\n{{main|Muhammad Ali Dynasty}}\nBy 1848, Muhammad Ali was old and senile enough for his tuberculosis-ridden son, [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim]], to demand his accession to the governorship.  The Ottoman sultan acceded to the demands, and Muhammad Ali was removed from power.  However, Ibrahim died of his disease months later, outlived by his father, who died in 1849.\n\nIbrahim was succeeded by his nephew [[Abbas I of Egypt|Abbas I]], who undid many of Muhammad Ali's accomplishments.  Abbas was assassinated by two of his slaves in 1854, and Muhammad Ali's fourth son, [[Sa'id of Egypt|Sa'id]], succeeded him.  Sa'id brought back many of his father's policies<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-4040.html |title=Egypt \u2013 Abbas Hilmi I, 1848\u201354 and Said, 1854\u201363 |publisher=Country-data.com |accessdate=31 October 2010}}</ref> but otherwise had an unremarkable reign.\n\nSa'id ruled for only nine years,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Khedive_of_Egypt_Ismail.aspx |title=Khedive of Egypt Ismail |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=31 October 2010}}</ref> and his nephew [[Isma'il Pasha|Isma'il]], another grandson of Muhammad Ali, became wali. In 1866 the polity occupied the [[Emirate of Harar]]. In 1867, the Ottoman sultan acknowledged Isma'il's use of the title [[khedive]]. In 1874, Ismail Pasha ordered the deputation of warships to capture Tadjoura whereafter for ten years, the Somali Coast Khedivate was established.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20130609002748/http://www.awdalpress.com/index/archives/16528</ref>\n\n===British occupation===\n{{main|British occupation of Egypt}}\n\nIn 1882 opposition to European control led to growing tension amongst native notables, the most dangerous opposition coming from the army. A large military demonstration in September 1881 forced the [[Tewfik Pasha|Khedive Tewfiq]] to dismiss his Prime Minister. In April 1882 France and Great Britain sent warships to [[Alexandria]] to bolster the Khedive amidst a turbulent climate, spreading fear of invasion throughout the country.\nBy June Egypt was in the hands of nationalists opposed to European domination of the country. A British naval bombardment of Alexandria had little effect on the opposition which led to the landing of a British expeditionary force at both ends of the [[Suez Canal]] in August 1882.  The British succeeded in defeating the Egyptian Army at Tel El Kebir in September and took control of the country putting Tewfiq back in control. The purpose of the invasion had been to restore political stability to Egypt under a government of the Khedive and international controls which were in place to streamline Egyptian financing since 1876.\n\nBritish occupation ended nominally with the deposition of the last ''khedive'' [[Abbas II of Egypt|Abbas II]] on 5 November 1914<ref name=\"Treaty\">[http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Treaty_of_Lausanne Article 17 of the Treaty of Lausanne (1923) regarding the new status of Egypt and Sudan, starting from 5 November 1914, when the Khedivate was abolished.]</ref> and the establishment of a [[Sultanate of Egypt|British protectorate]], with the installation of ''sultan'' [[Hussein Kamel of Egypt|Hussein Kamel]] on 19 December 1914.\n\n=== Sanctioned khedival rule (1867\u20131914) ===\n\n==== European influence ====\n\nBy Isma'il's reign, the Egyptian government, headed by the minister [[Nubar Pasha]], had become dependent on Britain and France for a healthy economy.  Isma'il attempted to end this European dominance, while at the same time pursuing an aggressive domestic policy.  Under Isma'il, 112 canals and 400 bridges were built in Egypt.<ref name=\"country-data2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-4044.html |title=Egypt \u2013 From Autonomy To Occupation: Ismail, Tawfiq, And The Urabi Revolt |publisher=Country-data.com |accessdate=31 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nBecause of his efforts to gain economic independence from the European powers, Isma'il became unpopular with many British and French diplomats, including [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer|Evelyn Baring]] and [[Alfred Milner]], who claimed that he was \"ruining Egypt.\"<ref name=\"country-data2\"/>\n\nIn 1869, the completion of the [[Suez Canal]] gave Britain a faster route to India.  This made Egypt increasingly reliant on Britain for both military and economic aid.  Isma'il made no effort to reconcile with the European powers, who pressured the Ottoman sultan into removing him from power.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n==== Tewfik and the loss of Sudan ====\n\nIsma'il was succeeded by his eldest son [[Tewfik Pasha|Tewfik]], who, unlike his younger brothers, had not been educated in Europe.  He pursued a policy of closer relations with Britain and France but his authority was undermined in a rebellion led by his war minister, [[Arabi Pasha]], in 1882.  Arabi took advantage of violent riots in [[Alexandria]] to seize control of the government and temporarily depose Tewfik.\n\nBritish naval forces shelled and captured Alexandria, and an expeditionary force under General Sir [[Garnet Wolseley]] was formed in England.  The British army landed in Egypt soon afterwards and defeated Arabi's army in the [[Battle of Tel el-Kebir]]. Arabi was tried for treason and sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted to exile.  After the revolt, the Egyptian army was reorganized on a British model and commanded by British officers.\n\nMeanwhile, a religious rebellion had broken out in the Sudan, led by [[Muhammad Ahmed]], who proclaimed himself the [[Mahdi]].  The [[Mahdist War|Mahdist]] rebels had seized the regional capital of [[Kordofan]] and annihilated two British-led expeditions sent to quell it.<ref name=\"heritage-history1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage-history.com/www/heritage.php?R_menu=OFF&Dir=wars&FileName=wars_soudan.php |title=Heritage History \u2013 Putting the \"Story\" back into History |publisher=Heritage-history.com |date=10 January 1904 |accessdate=31 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711164043/http://www.heritage-history.com/www/heritage.php?R_menu=OFF&Dir=wars&FileName=wars_soudan.php |archivedate=11 July 2011 }}</ref> The British soldier-adventurer [[Charles George Gordon]], an ex-governor of the Sudan, was sent to the Sudanese capital, [[Khartoum]], with orders to evacuate its minority of European and Egyptian inhabitants.

In G. garnhami three parts can be seen: epimerite, protomerite en deutomerite, although, it depends on the life stage of G. garnhami whether these three parts can be seen. a characteristic of gregarins is the typical construction of the pellicula that is formed by a [[Cell membrane]] and two cytoplasmamembranes (the latter is often refered to as the inner membrane complex, IMC or alveoli). Often the membranes are very close together making to see the distinction between them. This structure is often also refered to as the tri-layered structure. Beneath the inner membrane a [[Basal lamina|basal (internal) lamina]] can be seen. This basal lamina separates the epicytic foldings from the rest of the cel. These epicytic foldings form the outer surface of G. garnhami and hundreds of these can be observed at the surface enlarging the surface of the cell.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vivier |first1=E |last2=Petitprez |first2=A |title=The outer membrane complex and its development at the time of the formation of daughter cells in Toxoplasma gondii|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology |date=November 1969 |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=329\u201342 |doi=10.1083/jcb.43.2.329 |pmid=5344151|pmc=2107857 |taal=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Walker |first1=M.

In G. garnhami three parts can be seen: epimerite, protomerite en deutomerite, although, it depends on the life stage of G. garnhami whether these three parts can be seen. a characteristic of gregarins is the typical construction of the pellicula that is formed by a [[Cell membrane]] and two cytoplasmamembranes (the latter is often refered to as the inner membrane complex, IMC or alveoli). Often the membranes are very close together making to see the distinction between them. This structure is often also refered to as the tri-layered structure. Beneath the inner membrane a [[Basal lamina|basal (internal) lamina]] can be seen. This basal lamina separates the epicytic foldings from the rest of the cel. These epicytic foldings form the outer surface of G. garnhami and hundreds of these can be observed at the surface enlarging the surface of the cell.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vivier |first1=E |last2=Petitprez |first2=A |title=The outer membrane complex and its development at the time of the formation of daughter cells in Toxoplasma gondii|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology |date=November 1969 |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=329\u201342 |doi=10.1083/jcb.43.2.329 |pmid=5344151|pmc=2107857 |taal=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Walker |first1=M.
