{"title_page": "Scientology beliefs and practices", "text_new": "{{pp-semi-indef|small=yes}}\n{{short description|Scientology beliefs and practices}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2015}}\nThe [[Church of Scientology]] maintains a wide variety of beliefs and practices. The core belief says that a human is an [[immortality|immortal]], [[Spirit|spiritual being]] ([[thetan]]) that is resident in a physical body. The thetan has had innumerable [[Past lives#Scientology|past lives]], some of which, preceding the thetan's arrival on Earth, were lived in [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial cultures]]. Based on case studies at advanced levels, it is predicted that any Scientologist undergoing [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]] will eventually come across and recount a [[Incident (Scientology)|common series of events]].\n\nAccording to the Church, founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s discovery of the thetan places Scientology at the heart of the human quest for meaning, and proves that \"its origins are as ancient as religious thought itself.\" However, Scientology considers that its understanding of the thetan distinguishes it from other religious traditions, especially Judaism and Christianity, in three important ways. First, while many religions fuse the concept of the body and the soul, the thetan (spirit) is separate and independent. Second, unlike the three great world monotheisms, Scientologists believe in past lives and that the thetan has lived through many, perhaps thousands of lifetimes. Third, contrary to Christian concepts of [[original sin]], Scientology holds to the intrinsic goodness of a being and believes that the spiritual essence has lost touch with its nature. \"The spirit, then, is not a thing,\" Hubbard writes. \"It is the creator of things.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book | last1 = Bromley | first1 = David | last2 = Cowan | first2 = Douglas | title = Cults and new religions: a brief history }}</ref>\n\n[[Scientology]] describes itself as the study and handling of the [[spirit]] in relationship to itself, others, and all of life. Scientologists also believe that people have innate, yet suppressed, power and ability which can be regained if [[Clear (Scientology)|cleared]] of unwanted behaviour patterns and discomforts.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Road To Total Freedom|series=Panorama|publisher=BBC|airdate=April 27, 1987}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last = Farley|first = Robert|title = Scientology nearly ready to unveil Super Power|publisher = St. Petersburg Times|date=May 6, 2006|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/05/06/Tampabay/Scientology_nearly_re.shtml/|accessdate=2008-12-07}}</ref> Scientology is described as \"a religion to help people use scientific approaches to self-actualize their full potential.\"<ref name=Gutjahr>{{cite journal |jstor=30227336 | title = Reference: The State of the Discipline: Sacred Texts in the United States | journal = Book History | first = Paul C. | last = Gutjahr | volume = 4 | pages = 335\u2013370 | doi=10.1353/bh.2001.0008 | year=2001}}</ref> Believers reach their full potential \"when they understand themselves in their true relationship to the physical universe and the Supreme Being. \"<ref name=Gutjahr/> There have been many scholarly studies of Scientology and the books are freely available in bookshops, churches and most libraries.<ref name=Gutjahr/>\n\nThe Church of Scientology believes that \"Man is basically good, that he is seeking to survive, (and) that his survival depends on himself and his attainment of brotherhood with the universe,\" as stated in the Creed of the Church of Scientology.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Lewis | first1 = James R. | title = Scientology | publisher = Oxford University Press | date = March 2009  | location = Cary, NC | isbn = 978-0-19-533149-3}}</ref>\n\nRoy Wallis of Columbia University describes Scientology as \"a movement that straddles the boundaries between psychology and religion, [offering] a graded hierarchy of 'auditing' and training\" with the intention of releasing the individual's full potential.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Reference: The Road to Total Freedom, a Sociological Analysis of Scientology | journal = Review of Religious Research | date = Autumn 1978 | first = Kenneth E. | last = Burnham | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 119 | doi=10.2307/3509964| jstor = 3509964 }}</ref>\n\nScientology does not require that their members must exclusively believe in Scientology, distinguishing it from biblical religions.

The practice is one wherein a counselor called an \"auditor\" addresses a series of questions to a [[preclear]], observes and records the preclear's responses, and acknowledges them. An important element in all forms of auditing is to not suggest answers to the preclear or invalidate or degrade what the preclear says in response. It is of utmost importance that the auditor create a truly safe and distraction-free environment for the session.\n\nThe term \"Clear\" is derived from a button on a calculator that deletes previous calculations. According to Scientology beliefs, Clears are \"optimal individuals\" and \"they have been cleared of false information and memories of traumatic experiences that prevent them from adapting to the world around them in a natural and appropriate fashion.\" Scientologists believe that clears become more successful in their daily lives, \"be healthier, experience less stress, and possess better communication skills.\"<ref name=\"ZP\">{{harvnb|Zellner|1998|p=}}</ref>\n\n\"Auditing\" is sometimes seen as controversial, because auditing sessions are permanently recorded and stored within what are called \"preclear folders\". Scientologists believe that the practice of auditing helps them overcome the debilitating effects of traumatic experiences, most of which have accumulated over a multitude of lifetimes.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The folders are kept in accordance with the Priest/Penitent legal parameters which do not allow these folders to be seen or used for any other purpose or seen by any others who are not directly involved in supervising that person's auditing progress.\n\nAuditors are required to become proficient with the use of their E-meters. The device measures the subject's [[galvanic skin response]] in a manner similar to a [[polygraph]] (lie detector), but with only one electrode per hand rather than multiple sensors.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6S9MPQYvPFwC&pg=PT78 |page=78 |title=Religions of the Stars: What Hollywood Believes and How It Affects You |last=Abanes |first=Richard |publisher=Baker Books |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-4412-0445-5}}</ref> The E-meter is primarily used in auditing, which \"aims to remove (engrams) to produce a state of 'clear.'\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/595091823/Scientology-Church-now-claims-more-than-8-million-members.html?pg=all|title=Scientology: Church now claims more than 8 million members|author=Elaine Jarvik|date=September 18, 2004|work=DeseretNews.com}}</ref> Auditors do not receive final certification until they have successfully completed an internship, and have demonstrated a proven ability in the skills they have been trained in.{{Original research inline|date=December 2008}} Auditors often practice their auditing with each other, as well as friends or family.

A Scientologist must gain ''Knowledge'' of, take ''Responsibility'' for, and effectively exert ''Control'' over elements of his or her environment.\n\nThe ARC triangle is the lower triangle. It is a summary representation of the knowledge the Scientologist strives for.<ref name=\"Neusner\"/> It combines three components: \"Affinity\" is the degree of affection, love or liking, i.e. an emotional state.<ref name=\"Neusner\" /> \"Reality\" reflects [[consensual reality]], that is agreements on what is real.<ref name=\"Neusner\" /> \"Communication\", believed to be the most important element of the triangle, is the exchange of ideas.<ref name=\"Neusner\" /> Scientologists believe that improving one of the three aspects of the ARC triangle \"increases the level\" of the other two but the most important aspect of this triangle is \"communication\" mainly because communication drives the other two aspects: \"affinity\" and \"reality\".<ref name=\"GallagherAshcraft2006\">{{cite book|author1=Eugene V.

The second dynamic (a) is the sexual act itself and second dynamic (b) is the family unit, including the rearing of children.\n# The third dynamic is the urge toward survival through a group of individuals or as a group. Any group or part of an entire class could be considered to be a part of the third dynamic. The school, the club, the team, the town, the nation are examples of groups.\n# The fourth dynamic is the urge toward survival through all mankind and as all mankind.\n# The fifth dynamic is the urge toward survival through life forms such as animals, birds, insects, fish and vegetation, and is the urge to survive as these.\n# The sixth dynamic is the urge toward survival as the physical universe and has as its components ''Matter'', ''Energy'', ''Space'' and ''Time'', from which we derive the word MEST.\n# The seventh dynamic is the urge toward survival through spirits or as a spirit. Anything spiritual, with or without identity, would come under the seventh dynamic.

Ron Hubbard's book ''The History of Man'', published in 1952, there are two entities housed by the human body, a genetic entity (whose purpose is to carry on the evolutionary line) and a \"Thetan\" or consciousness \"that has the capacity to separate from body and mind.\" According to Hubbard, \"In man's long evolutionary development the Thetan has been trapped by the engrams formed at various stages of embodiment.\" Scientology training is aimed at clearing the person of all engrams, thus creating an \"Operating Thetan.\" \"Among the abilities of the Operating Thetan is the soul's capacity to leave and operate apart from the body.\"<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | last = Melton | first = J.

The core belief says that a human is an [[immortality|immortal]], [[Spirit|spiritual being]] ([[thetan]]) that is resident in a physical body. The thetan has had innumerable [[Past lives#Scientology|past lives]], some of which, preceding the thetan's arrival on Earth, were lived in [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial cultures]]. Based on case studies at advanced levels, it is predicted that any Scientologist undergoing [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]] will eventually come across and recount a [[Incident (Scientology)|common series of events]].\n\nAccording to the Church, founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s discovery of the thetan places Scientology at the heart of the human quest for meaning, and proves that \"its origins are as ancient as religious thought itself.\" However, Scientology considers that its understanding of the thetan distinguishes it from other religious traditions, especially Judaism and Christianity, in three important ways. First, while many religions fuse the concept of the body and the soul, the thetan (spirit) is separate and independent. Second, unlike the three great world monotheisms, Scientologists believe in past lives and that the thetan has lived through many, perhaps thousands of lifetimes. Third, contrary to Christian concepts of [[original sin]], Scientology holds to the intrinsic goodness of a being and believes that the spiritual essence has lost touch with its nature. \"The spirit, then, is not a thing,\" Hubbard writes. \"It is the creator of things.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book | last1 = Bromley | first1 = David | last2 = Cowan | first2 = Douglas | title = Cults and new religions: a brief history }}</ref>\n\n[[Scientology]] describes itself as the study and handling of the [[spirit]] in relationship to itself, others, and all of life. Scientologists also believe that people have innate, yet suppressed, power and ability which can be regained if [[Clear (Scientology)|cleared]] of unwanted behaviour patterns and discomforts.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Road To Total Freedom|series=Panorama|publisher=BBC|airdate=April 27, 1987}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last = Farley|first = Robert|title = Scientology nearly ready to unveil Super Power|publisher = St. Petersburg Times|date=May 6, 2006|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/05/06/Tampabay/Scientology_nearly_re.shtml/|accessdate=2008-12-07}}</ref> Scientology is described as \"a religion to help people use scientific approaches to self-actualize their full potential.\"<ref name=Gutjahr>{{cite journal |jstor=30227336 | title = Reference: The State of the Discipline: Sacred Texts in the United States | journal = Book History | first = Paul C. | last = Gutjahr | volume = 4 | pages = 335\u2013370 | doi=10.1353/bh.2001.0008 | year=2001}}</ref> Believers reach their full potential \"when they understand themselves in their true relationship to the physical universe and the Supreme Being. \"<ref name=Gutjahr/> There have been many scholarly studies of Scientology and the books are freely available in bookshops, churches and most libraries.<ref name=Gutjahr/>\n\nThe Church of Scientology believes that \"Man is basically good, that he is seeking to survive, (and) that his survival depends on himself and his attainment of brotherhood with the universe,\" as stated in the Creed of the Church of Scientology.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Lewis | first1 = James R. | title = Scientology | publisher = Oxford University Press | date = March 2009  | location = Cary, NC | isbn = 978-0-19-533149-3}}</ref>\n\nRoy Wallis of Columbia University describes Scientology as \"a movement that straddles the boundaries between psychology and religion, [offering] a graded hierarchy of 'auditing' and training\" with the intention of releasing the individual's full potential.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Reference: The Road to Total Freedom, a Sociological Analysis of Scientology | journal = Review of Religious Research | date = Autumn 1978 | first = Kenneth E. | last = Burnham | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 119 | doi=10.2307/3509964| jstor = 3509964 }}</ref>\n\nScientology does not require that their members must exclusively believe in Scientology, distinguishing it from biblical religions.

The practice is one wherein a counselor called an \"auditor\" addresses a series of questions to a [[preclear]], observes and records the preclear's responses, and acknowledges them. An important element in all forms of auditing is to not suggest answers to the preclear or invalidate or degrade what the preclear says in response. It is of utmost importance that the auditor create a truly safe and distraction-free environment for the session.\n\nThe term \"Clear\" is derived from a button on a calculator that deletes previous calculations. According to Scientology beliefs, Clears are \"optimal individuals\" and \"they have been cleared of false information and memories of traumatic experiences that prevent them from adapting to the world around them in a natural and appropriate fashion.\" Scientologists believe that clears become more successful in their daily lives, \"be healthier, experience less stress, and possess better communication skills.\"<ref name=\"ZP\">{{harvnb|Zellner|1998|p=}}</ref>\n\n\"Auditing\" is sometimes seen as controversial, because auditing sessions are permanently recorded and stored within what are called \"preclear folders\". Scientologists believe that the practice of auditing helps them overcome the debilitating effects of traumatic experiences, most of which have accumulated over a multitude of lifetimes.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The folders are kept in accordance with the Priest/Penitent legal parameters which do not allow these folders to be seen or used for any other purpose or seen by any others who are not directly involved in supervising that person's auditing progress.\n\nAuditors are required to become proficient with the use of their E-meters. The device measures the subject's [[galvanic skin response]] in a manner similar to a [[polygraph]] (lie detector), but with only one electrode per hand rather than multiple sensors.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6S9MPQYvPFwC&pg=PT78 |page=78 |title=Religions of the Stars: What Hollywood Believes and How It Affects You |last=Abanes |first=Richard |publisher=Baker Books |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-4412-0445-5}}</ref> The E-meter is primarily used in auditing, which \"aims to remove (engrams) to produce a state of 'clear.'\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/595091823/Scientology-Church-now-claims-more-than-8-million-members.html?pg=all|title=Scientology: Church now claims more than 8 million members|author=Elaine Jarvik|date=September 18, 2004|work=DeseretNews.com}}</ref> Auditors do not receive final certification until they have successfully completed an internship, and have demonstrated a proven ability in the skills they have been trained in.{{Original research inline|date=December 2008}} Auditors often practice their auditing with each other, as well as friends or family.

A Scientologist must gain ''Knowledge'' of, take ''Responsibility'' for, and effectively exert ''Control'' over elements of his or her environment.\n\nThe ARC triangle is the lower triangle.

The second dynamic (a) is the sexual act itself and second dynamic (b) is the family unit, including the rearing of children.\n# The third dynamic is the urge toward survival through a group of individuals or as a group. Any group or part of an entire class could be considered to be a part of the third dynamic. The school, the club, the team, the town, the nation are examples of groups.\n# The fourth dynamic is the urge toward survival through all mankind and as all mankind.\n# The fifth dynamic is the urge toward survival through life forms such as animals, birds, insects, fish and vegetation, and is the urge to survive as these.\n# The sixth dynamic is the urge toward survival as the physical universe and has as its components ''Matter'', ''Energy'', ''Space'' and ''Time'', from which we derive the word MEST.\n# The seventh dynamic is the urge toward survival through spirits or as a spirit. Anything spiritual, with or without identity, would come under the seventh dynamic. A sub-heading of this dynamic is ideas and concepts such as beauty and the desire to survive through these.\n# The eighth dynamic is the urge toward survival through the Supreme Being, or more exactly, infinity.\n\n===Thetans===\n{{See also|Purification Rundown}}\n\nAccording to L. Ron Hubbard's book ''The History of Man'', published in 1952, there are two entities housed by the human body, a genetic entity (whose purpose is to carry on the evolutionary line) and a \"Thetan\" or consciousness \"that has the capacity to separate from body and mind.\" According to Hubbard, \"In man's long evolutionary development the Thetan has been trapped by the engrams formed at various stages of embodiment.\" Scientology training is aimed at clearing the person of all engrams, thus creating an \"Operating Thetan.\" \"Among the abilities of the Operating Thetan is the soul's capacity to leave and operate apart from the body.\"<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | last = Melton | first = J.

(2002). ''A History of the World Speedway Championship''. Stroud: Tempus Publishing. {{ISBN|0-7524-2402-5}}</ref> He is also a two time [[Australian Individual Speedway Championship|Australian Champion]], winning in 1999 and 2001.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Australia===\nDespite being born in [[Sydney]], Todd Wiltshire spent most of his childhood in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]]. He started racing in 1979 at the [[Lake Macquarie]] Mini-Cycle Club, giving his older sister Fiona the credit for getting him started in racing saying she was his inspiration through her own involvement in dirt track racing. Wiltshire won numerous junior titles before capturing the Australian 500cc championship in his first senior year in 1986.\n\nSeeking a new challenge Wiltshire turned to Speedway in late 1986 and won the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]] Championship in both 1987 and 1988 at the [[Tralee Speedway]] in Australia's capital city [[Canberra]] and quickly established himself as one of the most promising young riders in Australia, finishing 4th in the 1989 [[Australian Under-21 Individual Speedway Championship|Australian Under-21 Championship]] in [[Mildura]]. He won his first major senior title in 1990 taking out the [[New South Wales]] Championship at his home track, the [[Newcastle Motordrome]], which had become the centre of Solo racing in NSW following the closure of the [[Liverpool Speedway|Liverpool City Raceway]] in 1989 and with the [[Sydney Showground Speedway]] only holding one or two meetings per year. Unfortunately family commitments kept him out of the [[Australian Individual Speedway Championship|Australian Final]] at the [[Brisbane Exhibition Ground]] but he was seeded directly into the Commonwealth Final at the [[Belle Vue Stadium]] in [[Manchester]], [[England]] where he finished a respectable 6th to qualify for the Intercontinental Final. Wiltshire finished 11th in [[Vojens]] in [[Denmark]] to be the only Australian and final qualifier for the World Final in Bradford.\n\nTodd Wiltshire finished a surprise 3rd at the World Final in Bradford in 1990, winning 3 of his 5 rides and finishing only one point behind winner [[Per Jonsson]] of [[Sweden]] and [[Shawn Moran]] of the USA (Moran was later stripped of his 2nd place after it was revealed he had failed a drug test at the Overseas Final in [[Coventry]], England. The [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Motocyclisme|FIM]] did not upgrade the standings and the official records show no second place rider). Big things were expected of him during the 1990/91 Australian season but he suffered something of a form slump. After losing his NSW crown to [[Craig Boyce]] he would only manage 5th in the Australian Championship at the {{convert|402|m|yd}} [[Arunga Park Speedway]] in [[Alice Springs]], though he paired with Boyce (who won the individual title) to win the Australian Pairs Championship a night earlier.\n\nHis 1990/91 Australian season did include success in some of the bigger meetings. On 8 December he captained NSW to a win over the touring [[Soviet Union national speedway team|Russian team]] at the Motordrome, being unbeaten in his 5 rides. It was the Russians first loss on their Australian tour. He then won the [[Billy Sanders]] Australian Open at the {{convert|450|m|yd}} [[Brisbane Exhibition Ground]] on 28 December, defeating Leigh Adams, [[Sam Ermolenko]] and [[1986 Australian Individual Speedway Championship|1986 Australian Champion]] [[Troy Butler]] in the 4 race Final. On 23 February he became the first Australian rider to win the now defunct \"Mr. Melbourne\" title at the {{convert|610|m|yd}} long [[Royal Melbourne Showgrounds]]. A week earlier he had finished second to Australian teammate and local rider [[Shane Bowes]] in the \"West End Speedway International\" at the {{convert|510|m|yd}} [[Adelaide Showgrounds|Wayville Showgrounds]] in [[Adelaide]]. [[1980 Individual Speedway World Championship|1980 World Champion]] [[Michael Lee (speedway rider)|Michael Lee]], making a comeback after 5 years out of the sport, finished 4th in Adelaide and 3rd in Melbourne.\n\nWiltshire headed back to the [[United Kingdom|UK]] but failed to re-capture his previous seasons form and the World #3 failed to make the World Final in [[1991 Individual Speedway World Championship|1991]]. After finishing third in the 1992 NSW title behind winner [[Mick Poole (speedway rider)|Mick Poole]] and Craig Boyce at the [[Nepean Speedway]] in north west Sydney, Wiltshire was seeded to ride in the [[1992 Australian Individual Speedway Championship|1992 Australian Championship]] to be held at the {{convert|280|m|yd}} [[North Arm Speedway]] in Adelaide. During his first ride of the meeting (Heat 3), and after leading three-quarters of the race, he was passed on the inside of the back straight by [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]'s [[Jason Lyons]]. Going into turn 3 Wiltshire fell while attempting to re-pass Lyons on the outside and slid into the safety fence, suffering terrible back injuries and multiple fractures of the Pelvis which forced him to spend a number of days recovering in the [[Royal Adelaide Hospital]]. Thankfully his Spinal Cord was not damaged in the crash, however the injuries were bad enough that the 23-year-old Wiltshire decided to retire from racing.\n\nAfter making a comeback to racing in [[Germany]] during 1997, Wiltshire won his first Australian Solo Championship in 1999 at the [[Olympic Park Speedway (Mildura)|Olympic Park Speedway]] in [[Mildura]]. He then went on to win the NSW Championship in 2000 and 2001 before winning his second Australian title at the [[Riverview Speedway]] in [[Murray Bridge, South Australia|Murray Bridge]] in [[2001 Australian Individual Speedway Championship|2001]]. After finishing 4th at Wayville in 2002, Wiltshire returned to the podium in [[2003 Australian Individual Speedway Championship|2003]], finishing second to Leigh Adams in [[Gosford]]. He would finish 3rd in 2004 (the first year the Australian Championship was run as a series rather than in the traditional single meeting format), before finishing second again in 2006 (again to Leigh Adams). Following his second placing in 2006, Wiltshire announced his retirement from racing.<ref>[http://www.vintagespeedway.com/Titles.html The Australian Solo Championship]</ref>\n\nIn 2011, the [[Kurri Kurri, New South Wales|Kurri Kurri]] Speedway club at the [[Loxford Park Speedway]] decided to honour Wiltshire as one of the [[Hunter Region]]'s former Solo riders by incorporating the '''Todd Wiltshire Cup''' for junior solos. The inaugural meeting was won by NSW rider Jack Holder who scored a perfect 15-point maximum. [[Brady Kurtz]] from [[Cowra, New South Wales|Cowra]] and [[Max Fricke]] from Victoria rounded out the podium places with Wiltshire himself on hand to award the winners trophy's.<ref>http://www.nswsra.com/</ref>\n\n===England===\nStarting in 1988, Todd Wiltshire rode for the [[Wimbledon Dons]] in the [[British League Division Two|National League]], helping the Dons to finish runners-up in the Knock-Out Cup in 1988 and second in the league in 1989. Wiltshire also won the Scottish Open Championship in 1989.\n\nWiltshire moved up to the [[British League|first division]] in 1990 with [[Reading Racers]] where he was voted British speedway rider of the year after finishing third in the World Final at Bradford. While with Reading where he was teammate to Per Jonsson, Wiltshire would win both the [[British League]] and [[British League Knockout Cup]] in 1990.\n\nHe had three spells with the [[Oxford Cheetahs]] from 1998-2001 where he was part of the Elite League title winning team in [[2001 Elite League speedway season|2001]]. After not racing for [[Oxford Cheetahs|Oxford]] in the 2002 season, due to a rule capping the number of Grand Prix riders in Elite League teams, he returned to the team in 2003 and he also made a short-lived but successful comeback in 2006 for the [[Oxford Cheetahs|Cheetahs]] before retiring for the last time.\n\n===Germany===\nFollowing his crash at the 1992 Australian Championships which had forced his retirement, Todd Wiltshire made a comeback in 1997, riding in [[Germany]] in a bid to gain a place in the [[Speedway Grand Prix]] after being denied a licence to race in the [[United Kingdom]]. Though he won the [[German Individual Speedway Championship|German Individual Championship]] in both 1997 and 1998, he failed to qualify for the SGP until [[2000 Speedway Grand Prix|2000]].\n\n===International===\nTodd Wiltshire first made his mark on the international scene when he was a surprise qualifier for the [[1990 Individual Speedway World Championship]] to be held at the [[Odsal Stadium]] in [[Bradford]], [[England]]. Wiltshire had qualified for the final after finishing 6th in the '''Commonwealth Final''', 2nd in the '''Overseas Final''', and was the lucky last qualifier from the '''[[Intercontinental Final]]'''. He would surprise further by winning his first two races in the World Final before eventually finishing 3rd, only 1 point behind Reading teammate Per Jonsson who defeated [[Shawn Moran]] of the [[United States]] in a runoff after both finished on 13 points (Moran was later stripped of 2nd place after failing a drug test at the Overseas Final 3 months prior to the World Final). Despite Moran's disqualification, the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Motocyclisme|FIM]] did not upgrade placings and Wiltshire remains in 3rd place in the record books with no second place medal awarded.\n\nWiltshire followed up his 3rd placing in the Individual Final with 2nd in the [[1990 Speedway World Pairs Championship]] at the [[Ellerm\u00fchle Stadium]] in [[Landshut]], Germany, paired with fellow Aussie Leigh Adams. Wiltshire and Adams finished 2 points behind defending champions [[Jan O. Pedersen]] and [[Hans Nielsen (speedway rider)|Hans Nielsen]] of [[Denmark]]. With 25 points, Wiltshire was the meetings top scorer with 3 wins, a second and two third placings from his six rides.\n\nFollowing his win in the Australian Championship in 1999, Wiltshire was given a birth in the Overseas Final. He finished 4th to easily qualify for the Intercontinental Final. He won the 1999 IC Final which gave him an automatic berth in the 2000 Speedway Grand Prix. He would ride in the SGP from 2000 until 2003 though he never managed to achieve higher than second place in a Grand Prix event.\n\nWiltshire was also part of the [[Australia national speedway team|Australian team]] which won the [[1999 Speedway World Team Cup]], the first time since [[1976 Speedway World Team Cup|1976]] that Australia had won the title, as well as representing Australia in numerous test matches around the world. He repeated the success in both [[2001 Speedway World Cup|2001]] and [[2002 Speedway World Cup|2002]] (the [[Speedway World Team Cup]] was replaced after 2000 with the [[Speedway World Cup]]).\n\n==World Final Appearances==\n\n===Individual World Championship===\n* [[1990 Individual Speedway World Championship|1990]] - {{Flagicon|GBR}} [[Bradford]], [[Odsal Stadium]] - '''3rd''' - 12pts\n\n===World Pairs Championship===\n* [[1990 Speedway World Pairs Championship|1990]] - {{Flagicon|GER}} [[Landshut]], [[Ellerm\u00fchle Stadium]] (with [[Leigh Adams]]) - '''2nd''' - 41pts (25)\n\n===World Team Cup===\n* [[1999 Speedway World Team Cup|1999]] - {{Flagicon|CZE}} [[Pardubice]], [[Sv\u00edtkova Stadion]] (with [[Leigh Adams]] / [[Jason Crump]] / [[Ryan Sullivan]] / [[Jason Lyons]]) - '''Winner''' - 55pts (2)\n* [[2000 Speedway World Team Cup|2000]] - {{Flagicon|GBR}} [[Coventry]], [[Brandon Stadium]] (with [[Jason Crump]] / [[Leigh Adams]] / [[Ryan Sullivan]] / [[Craig Boyce]]) - 4th - 29pts (2)\n\n===World Cup===\n* [[2001 Speedway World Cup Final|2001]] - {{Flagicon|POL}} [[Wroc\u0142aw]], [[Olympic Stadium (Wroc\u0142aw)|Olympic Stadium]] (with [[Jason Crump]] / [[Craig Boyce]] / [[Ryan Sullivan]] / [[Leigh Adams]]) - '''Winner''' - 68pts (10)\n* [[2002 Speedway World Cup Final|2002]] - {{Flagicon|GBR}} [[Peterborough]], [[East of England Showground]] (with [[Leigh Adams]] / [[Jason Lyons]] / [[Jason Crump]] / [[Ryan Sullivan]]) - '''Winner''' - 64pts (13)\n* [[2003 Speedway World Cup Final|2003]] - {{Flagicon|DEN}} [[Vojens]], [[Vojens Speedway Center|Speedway Center]] (with [[Jason Crump]] / [[Jason Lyons]] / [[Ryan Sullivan]] / [[Leigh Adams]]) - '''2nd''' - 57pts (15)\n* [[2006 Speedway World Cup Final|2006]] - {{Flagicon|GBR}} [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Smallmead Stadium]] (with [[Travis McGowan]] / [[Ryan Sullivan]] / [[Leigh Adams]] / [[Jason Crump]]) - 4th - 35pts (8)\n\n==Speedway Grand Prix results==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"   style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

He started racing in 1979 at the [[Lake Macquarie]] Mini-Cycle Club, giving his older sister Fiona the credit for getting him started in racing saying she was his inspiration through her own involvement in dirt track racing. Wiltshire won numerous junior titles before capturing the Australian 500cc championship in his first senior year in 1986.\n\nSeeking a new challenge Wiltshire turned to Speedway in late 1986 and won the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]] Championship in both 1987 and 1988 at the [[Tralee Speedway]] in Australia's capital city [[Canberra]] and quickly established himself as one of the most promising young riders in Australia, finishing 4th in the 1989 [[Australian Under-21 Individual Speedway Championship|Australian Under-21 Championship]] in [[Mildura]]. He won his first major senior title in 1990 taking out the [[New South Wales]] Championship at his home track, the [[Newcastle Motordrome]], which had become the centre of Solo racing in NSW following the closure of the [[Liverpool Speedway|Liverpool City Raceway]] in 1989 and with the [[Sydney Showground Speedway]] only holding one or two meetings per year. Unfortunately family commitments kept him out of the [[Australian Individual Speedway Championship|Australian Final]] at the [[Brisbane Exhibition Ground]] but he was seeded directly into the Commonwealth Final at the [[Belle Vue Stadium]] in [[Manchester]], [[England]] where he finished a respectable 6th to qualify for the Intercontinental Final. Wiltshire finished 11th in [[Vojens]] in [[Denmark]] to be the only Australian and final qualifier for the World Final in Bradford.\n\nTodd Wiltshire finished a surprise 3rd at the World Final in Bradford in 1990, winning 3 of his 5 rides and finishing only one point behind winner [[Per Jonsson]] of [[Sweden]] and [[Shawn Moran]] of the USA (Moran was later stripped of his 2nd place after it was revealed he had failed a drug test at the Overseas Final in [[Coventry]], England. The [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Motocyclisme|FIM]] did not upgrade the standings and the official records show no second place rider). Big things were expected of him during the 1990/91 Australian season but he suffered something of a form slump. After losing his NSW crown to [[Craig Boyce]] he would only manage 5th in the Australian Championship at the {{convert|402|m|yd}} [[Arunga Park Speedway]] in [[Alice Springs]], though he paired with Boyce (who won the individual title) to win the Australian Pairs Championship a night earlier.\n\nHis 1990/91 Australian season did include success in some of the bigger meetings. On 8 December he captained NSW to a win over the touring [[Soviet Union national speedway team|Russian team]] at the Motordrome, being unbeaten in his 5 rides. It was the Russians first loss on their Australian tour. He then won the [[Billy Sanders]] Australian Open at the {{convert|450|m|yd}} [[Brisbane Exhibition Ground]] on 28 December, defeating Leigh Adams, [[Sam Ermolenko]] and [[1986 Australian Individual Speedway Championship|1986 Australian Champion]] [[Troy Butler]] in the 4 race Final. On 23 February he became the first Australian rider to win the now defunct \"Mr. Melbourne\" title at the {{convert|610|m|yd}} long [[Royal Melbourne Showgrounds]]. A week earlier he had finished second to Australian teammate and local rider [[Shane Bowes]] in the \"West End Speedway International\" at the {{convert|510|m|yd}} [[Adelaide Showgrounds|Wayville Showgrounds]] in [[Adelaide]]. [[1980 Individual Speedway World Championship|1980 World Champion]] [[Michael Lee (speedway rider)|Michael Lee]], making a comeback after 5 years out of the sport, finished 4th in Adelaide and 3rd in Melbourne.\n\nWiltshire headed back to the [[United Kingdom|UK]] but failed to re-capture his previous seasons form and the World #3 failed to make the World Final in [[1991 Individual Speedway World Championship|1991]]. After finishing third in the 1992 NSW title behind winner [[Mick Poole (speedway rider)|Mick Poole]] and Craig Boyce at the [[Nepean Speedway]] in north west Sydney, Wiltshire was seeded to ride in the [[1992 Australian Individual Speedway Championship|1992 Australian Championship]] to be held at the {{convert|280|m|yd}} [[North Arm Speedway]] in Adelaide. During his first ride of the meeting (Heat 3), and after leading three-quarters of the race, he was passed on the inside of the back straight by [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]'s [[Jason Lyons]]. Going into turn 3 Wiltshire fell while attempting to re-pass Lyons on the outside and slid into the safety fence, suffering terrible back injuries and multiple fractures of the Pelvis which forced him to spend a number of days recovering in the [[Royal Adelaide Hospital]]. Thankfully his Spinal Cord was not damaged in the crash, however the injuries were bad enough that the 23-year-old Wiltshire decided to retire from racing.\n\nAfter making a comeback to racing in [[Germany]] during 1997, Wiltshire won his first Australian Solo Championship in 1999 at the [[Olympic Park Speedway (Mildura)|Olympic Park Speedway]] in [[Mildura]]. He then went on to win the NSW Championship in 2000 and 2001 before winning his second Australian title at the [[Riverview Speedway]] in [[Murray Bridge, South Australia|Murray Bridge]] in [[2001 Australian Individual Speedway Championship|2001]]. After finishing 4th at Wayville in 2002, Wiltshire returned to the podium in [[2003 Australian Individual Speedway Championship|2003]], finishing second to Leigh Adams in [[Gosford]]. He would finish 3rd in 2004 (the first year the Australian Championship was run as a series rather than in the traditional single meeting format), before finishing second again in 2006 (again to Leigh Adams). Following his second placing in 2006, Wiltshire announced his retirement from racing.<ref>[http://www.vintagespeedway.com/Titles.html The Australian Solo Championship]</ref>\n\nIn 2011, the [[Kurri Kurri, New South Wales|Kurri Kurri]] Speedway club at the [[Loxford Park Speedway]] decided to honour Wiltshire as one of the [[Hunter Region]]'s former Solo riders by incorporating the '''Todd Wiltshire Cup''' for junior solos. The inaugural meeting was won by NSW rider Jack Holder who scored a perfect 15-point maximum. [[Brady Kurtz]] from [[Cowra, New South Wales|Cowra]] and [[Max Fricke]] from Victoria rounded out the podium places with Wiltshire himself on hand to award the winners trophy's.<ref>http://www.nswsra.com/</ref>\n\n===England===\nStarting in 1988, Todd Wiltshire rode for the [[Wimbledon Dons]] in the [[British League Division Two|National League]], helping the Dons to finish runners-up in the Knock-Out Cup in 1988 and second in the league in 1989. Wiltshire also won the Scottish Open Championship in 1989.\n\nWiltshire moved up to the [[British League|first division]] in 1990 with [[Reading Racers]] where he was voted British speedway rider of the year after finishing third in the World Final at Bradford. While with Reading where he was teammate to Per Jonsson, Wiltshire would win both the [[British League]] and [[British League Knockout Cup]] in 1990.\n\nHe had three spells with the [[Oxford Cheetahs]] from 1998-2001 where he was part of the Elite League title winning team in [[2001 Elite League speedway season|2001]]. After not racing for [[Oxford Cheetahs|Oxford]] in the 2002 season, due to a rule capping the number of Grand Prix riders in Elite League teams, he returned to the team in 2003 and he also made a short-lived but successful comeback in 2006 for the [[Oxford Cheetahs|Cheetahs]] before retiring for the last time.\n\n===Germany===\nFollowing his crash at the 1992 Australian Championships which had forced his retirement, Todd Wiltshire made a comeback in 1997, riding in [[Germany]] in a bid to gain a place in the [[Speedway Grand Prix]] after being denied a licence to race in the [[United Kingdom]]. Though he won the [[German Individual Speedway Championship|German Individual Championship]] in both 1997 and 1998, he failed to qualify for the SGP until [[2000 Speedway Grand Prix|2000]].\n\n===International===\nTodd Wiltshire first made his mark on the international scene when he was a surprise qualifier for the [[1990 Individual Speedway World Championship]] to be held at the [[Odsal Stadium]] in [[Bradford]], [[England]]. Wiltshire had qualified for the final after finishing 6th in the '''Commonwealth Final''', 2nd in the '''Overseas Final''', and was the lucky last qualifier from the '''[[Intercontinental Final]]'''. He would surprise further by winning his first two races in the World Final before eventually finishing 3rd, only 1 point behind Reading teammate Per Jonsson who defeated [[Shawn Moran]] of the [[United States]] in a runoff after both finished on 13 points (Moran was later stripped of 2nd place after failing a drug test at the Overseas Final 3 months prior to the World Final). Despite Moran's disqualification, the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Motocyclisme|FIM]] did not upgrade placings and Wiltshire remains in 3rd place in the record books with no second place medal awarded.\n\nWiltshire followed up his 3rd placing in the Individual Final with 2nd in the [[1990 Speedway World Pairs Championship]] at the [[Ellerm\u00fchle Stadium]] in [[Landshut]], Germany, paired with fellow Aussie Leigh Adams. Wiltshire and Adams finished 2 points behind defending champions [[Jan O. Pedersen]] and [[Hans Nielsen (speedway rider)|Hans Nielsen]] of [[Denmark]]. With 25 points, Wiltshire was the meetings top scorer with 3 wins, a second and two third placings from his six rides.\n\nFollowing his win in the Australian Championship in 1999, Wiltshire was given a birth in the Overseas Final. He finished 4th to easily qualify for the Intercontinental Final. He won the 1999 IC Final which gave him an automatic berth in the 2000 Speedway Grand Prix. He would ride in the SGP from 2000 until 2003 though he never managed to achieve higher than second place in a Grand Prix event.\n\nWiltshire was also part of the [[Australia national speedway team|Australian team]] which won the [[1999 Speedway World Team Cup]], the first time since [[1976 Speedway World Team Cup|1976]] that Australia had won the title, as well as representing Australia in numerous test matches around the world. He repeated the success in both [[2001 Speedway World Cup|2001]] and [[2002 Speedway World Cup|2002]] (the [[Speedway World Team Cup]] was replaced after 2000 with the [[Speedway World Cup]]).\n\n==World Final Appearances==\n\n===Individual World Championship===\n* [[1990 Individual Speedway World Championship|1990]] - {{Flagicon|GBR}} [[Bradford]], [[Odsal Stadium]] - '''3rd''' - 12pts\n\n===World Pairs Championship===\n* [[1990 Speedway World Pairs Championship|1990]] - {{Flagicon|GER}} [[Landshut]], [[Ellerm\u00fchle Stadium]] (with [[Leigh Adams]]) - '''2nd''' - 41pts (25)\n\n===World Team Cup===\n* [[1999 Speedway World Team Cup|1999]] - {{Flagicon|CZE}} [[Pardubice]], [[Sv\u00edtkova Stadion]] (with [[Leigh Adams]] / [[Jason Crump]] / [[Ryan Sullivan]] / [[Jason Lyons]]) - '''Winner''' - 55pts (2)\n* [[2000 Speedway World Team Cup|2000]] - {{Flagicon|GBR}} [[Coventry]], [[Brandon Stadium]] (with [[Jason Crump]] / [[Leigh Adams]] / [[Ryan Sullivan]] / [[Craig Boyce]]) - 4th - 29pts (2)\n\n===World Cup===\n* [[2001 Speedway World Cup Final|2001]] - {{Flagicon|POL}} [[Wroc\u0142aw]], [[Olympic Stadium (Wroc\u0142aw)|Olympic Stadium]] (with [[Jason Crump]] / [[Craig Boyce]] / [[Ryan Sullivan]] / [[Leigh Adams]]) - '''Winner''' - 68pts (10)\n* [[2002 Speedway World Cup Final|2002]] - {{Flagicon|GBR}} [[Peterborough]], [[East of England Showground]] (with [[Leigh Adams]] / [[Jason Lyons]] / [[Jason Crump]] / [[Ryan Sullivan]]) - '''Winner''' - 64pts (13)\n* [[2003 Speedway World Cup Final|2003]] - {{Flagicon|DEN}} [[Vojens]], [[Vojens Speedway Center|Speedway Center]] (with [[Jason Crump]] / [[Jason Lyons]] / [[Ryan Sullivan]] / [[Leigh Adams]]) - '''2nd''' - 57pts (15)\n* [[2006 Speedway World Cup Final|2006]] - {{Flagicon|GBR}} [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Smallmead Stadium]] (with [[Travis McGowan]] / [[Ryan Sullivan]] / [[Leigh Adams]] / [[Jason Crump]]) - 4th - 35pts (8)\n\n==Speedway Grand Prix results==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"   style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!
