At the age of seventeen, Ventura enrolled as a volunteer in the militia of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] and later served with [[Napoleon]]'s imperial army in the Queens's Dragons. After the [[Battle of Waterloo]] and the final downfall of Napoleon, he returned home. However, in 1817, as his revolutionary and Napoleonic sympathies became known to the local authorities following a dispute between him and a member of the reactionary Ducal police, he was obliged to leave the country.\n\nHe went first to [[Trieste]], and then to [[Constantinople]], where he was for a time a ship-broker.\n\nLearning that Persia was seeking the services of European soldiers, he obtained an officer's commission and helped to instruct the forces of the shah in European methods of warfare, soon becoming a colonel. Upon the death of the shah in 1822, Ventura offered his services to his successor, 'Abbas Mirza. In the latter's service, however, were a number of English officers who were decidedly hostile to the French; they considered Ventura to be French because he had fought under Napoleon. As a result of their political intrigues, Ventura was dismissed. \n\nHe travelled east, ending in Lahore with [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Allard]] in 1822. They took service with the Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]] of Punjab. In March the following year, they both held command in the [[Battle of Nowshera]], where they defeated a combined Afghan force, resulting in Punjab's capture of [[Peshawar]].\n\nA rebellion having arisen in Afghanistan, Ventura conducted successfully several campaigns of a difficult nature, and greatly enlarged the boundaries of the [[Sikh period in Lahore|kingdom of Lahore]].\n\nTogether with Allard, [[Paolo Di Avitabile]], and [[Claude August Court]], Ventura formed the group of European mercenary officers responsible for the modernisation of the Sikh army. He also took responsibility for the training and command of the [[Fauj-i-Khas]], the European model brigade. Ventura \"reorganised the infantry into a formidable army including Gurkhas, Pathans, Biharis and Ooriyas.\"<ref>Major Pearse, Hugh; ''Ranjit Singh and his white officers''.

He rose rapidly in the Darbar and virtually became the Commander in Chief of the Darbar forces.\n\nVentura married an Indian (or a local Armenian according other sources) lady, with whom he had a daughter, but he always longed to return to his native country. In 1837 he went on a diplomatic mission to Paris and London, but was recalled to Lahore before he had time to visit his family.\n\n[[File:Venturawiki2.jpg|thumb|right|Sketch from Charles Grey's ''European Adventurers of Northern India'' (Lahore: 1929)]]\nHe spent his spare time in Peshawar exhuming Bactrian Greek and Kushan coins from Hindu temples and Buddhist stupas in the [[Khyber Pass]], making numerous excavations then sending the findings on to the Asiatic Society of Bengal in Calcutta. \n\nHe served faithfully under Ranjit Singh and his successors [[Kharak Singh]], [[Nau Nihal Singh]], and [[Sher Singh]].

Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death.

Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking.

By Robert Spence Hardy</ref>\n\nThe development of the Magadhi language into its current form is unknown. However, language scholars have come to a conclusion that Magahi along with [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Bhojpuri]], [[Maithili language|Maithili]] and [[Oriya language|Oriya]] originated from the Magadhi Prakrit during the 8th to 11th centuries. These different dialects differentiated themselves and took their own course of growth and development. But it is not certain when exactly it took place. It was probably such an unidentified period during which modern Indian languages begin to take modern shape. By the end of the 12th century, the development of [[Middle Indo-Aryan languages#Apabhramsa|Apabhramsa]] reached its climax. [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], Marathi, Bengali, Assamese, Oriya, Maithili and other modern languages took definite shape in their literary writings in the beginning of the 14th century. The distinct shape of Magadhi can be seen in the ''Dohakosha'' written by Sarahapa and Kauhapa. Magahi had a setback due to the transition period of Magadha administration.<ref>Maitra Asim, ''Magahi Culture'', Cosmo Publications, New Delhi (1983), pp. 64</ref> Traditionally, strolling bards recite long epic poems in this dialect, and it was because of this that the word \"Magahi\" came to mean \"a bard\". [[Kaithi]] is the script generally used for it. The pronunciation in Magahi is not as broad as in Maithili and there are a number of verbal forms for each person.<ref name=\"Maithili and Magahi\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bihar.ws/info/Bihari-Languages/Maithili-and-Magahi.html|title=Maithili and Magahi|accessdate=10 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723144641/http://bihar.ws/info/Bihari-Languages/Maithili-and-Magahi.html|archive-date=23 July 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Historically, Magahi had no famous written literature. There are many popular songs throughout the area in which the language is spoken, and strolling bards recite various long epic poems which are known more or less over the whole of Northern India. In Magahi spoken area folk singers sing a good number of ballads. Introduction of Urdu meant a setback to local languages as its Persian script was alien to local people.\n\nThe first success for spreading Hindi occurred in Bihar in 1881, when Hindi displaced [[Urdu]] as the official language of the province. After independence, Hindi was given the sole official status through the Bihar Official Language Act, 1950.<ref>[[Paul Brass|Brass Paul R.]], ''The Politics of India Since Independence'', Cambridge University Press, pp. 183</ref>\n\n==Speakers of Magahi==\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2019}}\nThere are several dialects of Magadhi. It is spoken in the area which formed the core of the ancient kingdom of [[Magadha]] - the modern districts of [[Patna District|Patna]], [[Nalanda District|Nalanda]], [[Gaya District|Gaya]], [[Jehanabad District|Jehanabad]], [[Arwal District|Arwal]], [[Aurangabad District, Bihar|Aurangabad]], [[Lakhisarai District|Lakhisarai]], [[Sheikhpura District|Sheikhpura]] and [[Nawada District|Nawada and Munger]]. Magahi is bounded on the north by the various forms of [[Maithili language|Maithili]] spoken in [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]] across the Ganga. On the west it is bounded by the [[Bhojpuri]], On the northeast it is bounded by Maithili and [[Angika]].\nA blend of [[Magahi]] known as [[Khortha language|Khortha]] is spoken by non-tribal populace in [[North Chotanagpur division]] of [[Jharkhand]] which comprises districts of [[Bokaro district|Bokaro]], [[Chatra]], [[Dhanbad]], [[Giridih]], [[Hazaribagh]], [[Koderma]] and [[Ramgarh district|Ramgarh]]. People of Southern Bihar and Northern Jharkhand are mostly speakers of Magadhi language.<ref>Jain Dhanesh, Cardona George, The Indo-Aryan Languages, pp500</ref> Magahi is also spoken in [[Malda district]] of [[West Bengal]].<ref name=\"Magahi01\"/><ref name=\"Magahi02\"/> According to 2011 Census, there were approximately 20.7&nbsp;million Magadhi speakers.<ref name=\"census2011\"/> For most of the magahi-speakers, Hindi is the generic name for their language. The number of Magadhi speakers is difficult to indicate because of unreliable sources.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==Scripts and literary tradition==\n\nMagadhi is generally written using [[Devanagari]] script. A later-developed script of Magadhi is Kaithi.<ref name=\"Maithili and Magahi\"/>\nThere have been effort by scholars in the Magahi area to explore and identify a literary tradition for Magadhi. Magadhi has a rich tradition of folk literature, and in modern times there have been various activities in the publication of literary writing. Magahi Parishad was established in Patna in 1952, which was renamed Bihar Magahi Mandal. ''Magadhi'', a journal, was started at the same time, which was renamed ''Bihan'', meaning \"tomorrow\" or the coming dawn. Later Akhil Bhartiya Magahi Sahitya Sammelan was established by Dr Ram Prasad Singh in 1977 and published a well known magazine \" Magahi Lok\". Another very famous monthly journal was started by Magahi Academy, Gaya edited by Dr. Ram Prasad Singh. Another magazine \"Magadhi\" is published by Akhil Bhartiya Magahi Bhasa Sammelan. It is headed by Kavi Yogesh. [[Nalanda Open University]] offers various courses on Magahi.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nalandaopenuniversity.com/courses.html |title=Nalanda Open University - Courses |accessdate=17 November 2018}}</ref> Maghi language has a lot of poets who with their writings has influenced the common mass a lot. Among those poets the name of ''Maghi Kokil'' Jairam Singh is indelible. He is one of the scintillating gems of Maghi Sahitya. His song \"\u092c\u0926\u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0917\u093e\u0935 \u0939\u0948 \u0915\u091c\u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e\" created an unforgettable imprint on the minds of Maghi lovers. His recently published book \"\u091a\u093f\u091c\u094b\u0930\" contains a variety of poems. Another magahi poet known locally as Lal Baba (\u0932\u093e\u0932 \u092c\u093e\u092c\u093e) for his red coloured dress, Ramashish Prasad Singh of [[Lakhisarai]] has written several poem and some of his famous collection is printed in book \"Magahi Ke Phoool\" (\u092e\u0917\u0939\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u092b\u0942\u0932). He has recorded poem and songs for [[All India Radio|All India Radio Patna]] station.\n\n===Weekdays===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! English\n!

By Robert Spence Hardy</ref>\n\nThe development of the Magadhi language into its current form is unknown. However, language scholars have come to a conclusion that Magahi along with [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Bhojpuri]], [[Maithili language|Maithili]] and [[Oriya language|Oriya]] originated from the Magadhi Prakrit during the 8th to 11th centuries. These different dialects differentiated themselves and took their own course of growth and development. But it is not certain when exactly it took place. It was probably such an unidentified period during which modern Indian languages begin to take modern shape. By the end of the 12th century, the development of [[Middle Indo-Aryan languages#Apabhramsa|Apabhramsa]] reached its climax. [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], Marathi, Bengali, Assamese, Oriya, Maithili and other modern languages took definite shape in their literary writings in the beginning of the 14th century. The distinct shape of Magadhi can be seen in the ''Dohakosha'' written by Sarahapa and Kauhapa. Magahi had a setback due to the transition period of Magadha administration.<ref>Maitra Asim, ''Magahi Culture'', Cosmo Publications, New Delhi (1983), pp. 64</ref> Traditionally, strolling bards recite long epic poems in this dialect, and it was because of this that the word \"Magahi\" came to mean \"a bard\". [[Kaithi]] is the script generally used for it. The pronunciation in Magahi is not as broad as in Maithili and there are a number of verbal forms for each person.<ref name=\"Maithili and Magahi\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bihar.ws/info/Bihari-Languages/Maithili-and-Magahi.html|title=Maithili and Magahi|accessdate=10 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723144641/http://bihar.ws/info/Bihari-Languages/Maithili-and-Magahi.html|archive-date=23 July 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Historically, Magahi had no famous written literature. There are many popular songs throughout the area in which the language is spoken, and strolling bards recite various long epic poems which are known more or less over the whole of Northern India. In Magahi spoken area folk singers sing a good number of ballads. Introduction of Urdu meant a setback to local languages as its Persian script was alien to local people.\n\nThe first success for spreading Hindi occurred in Bihar in 1881, when Hindi displaced [[Urdu]] as the official language of the province. After independence, Hindi was given the sole official status through the Bihar Official Language Act, 1950.<ref>[[Paul Brass|Brass Paul R.]], ''The Politics of India Since Independence'', Cambridge University Press, pp. 183</ref>\n\n==Speakers of Magahi==\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2019}}\nThere are several dialects of Magadhi. It is spoken in the area which formed the core of the ancient kingdom of [[Magadha]] - the modern districts of [[Patna District|Patna]], [[Nalanda District|Nalanda]], [[Gaya District|Gaya]], [[Jehanabad District|Jehanabad]], [[Arwal District|Arwal]], [[Aurangabad District, Bihar|Aurangabad]], [[Lakhisarai District|Lakhisarai]], [[Sheikhpura District|Sheikhpura]] and [[Nawada District|Nawada and Munger]]. Magahi is bounded on the north by the various forms of [[Maithili language|Maithili]] spoken in [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]] across the Ganga. On the west it is bounded by the [[Bhojpuri]], On the northeast it is bounded by Maithili and [[Angika]].\nA blend of [[Magahi]] known as [[Khortha language|Khortha]] is spoken by non-tribal populace in [[North Chotanagpur division]] of [[Jharkhand]] which comprises districts of [[Bokaro district|Bokaro]], [[Chatra]], [[Dhanbad]], [[Giridih]], [[Hazaribagh]], [[Koderma]] and [[Ramgarh district|Ramgarh]]. People of Southern Bihar and Northern Jharkhand are mostly speakers of Magadhi language.<ref>Jain Dhanesh, Cardona George, The Indo-Aryan Languages, pp500</ref> Magahi is also spoken in [[Malda district]] of [[West Bengal]].<ref name=\"Magahi01\"/><ref name=\"Magahi02\"/> According to 2011 Census, there were approximately 20.7&nbsp;million Magadhi speakers.<ref name=\"census2011\"/> For most of the magahi-speakers, Hindi is the generic name for their language. The number of Magadhi speakers is difficult to indicate because of unreliable sources.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==Scripts and literary tradition==\n\nMagadhi is generally written using [[Devanagari]] script. A later-developed script of Magadhi is Kaithi.<ref name=\"Maithili and Magahi\"/>\nThere have been effort by scholars in the Magahi area to explore and identify a literary tradition for Magadhi. Magadhi has a rich tradition of folk literature, and in modern times there have been various activities in the publication of literary writing. Magahi Parishad was established in Patna in 1952, which was renamed Bihar Magahi Mandal. ''Magadhi'', a journal, was started at the same time, which was renamed ''Bihan'', meaning \"tomorrow\" or the coming dawn. Later Akhil Bhartiya Magahi Sahitya Sammelan was established by Dr Ram Prasad Singh in 1977 and published a well known magazine \" Magahi Lok\". Another very famous monthly journal was started by Magahi Academy, Gaya edited by Dr. Ram Prasad Singh. Another magazine \"Magadhi\" is published by Akhil Bhartiya Magahi Bhasa Sammelan. It is headed by Kavi Yogesh. [[Nalanda Open University]] offers various courses on Magahi.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nalandaopenuniversity.com/courses.html |title=Nalanda Open University - Courses |accessdate=17 November 2018}}</ref> Maghi language has a lot of poets who with their writings has influenced the common mass a lot. Among those poets the name of ''Maghi Kokil'' Jairam Singh is indelible. He is one of the scintillating gems of Maghi Sahitya. His song \"\u092c\u0926\u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0917\u093e\u0935 \u0939\u0948 \u0915\u091c\u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e\" created an unforgettable imprint on the minds of Maghi lovers.

But no manuscriptic text has been seen after its prakrit form synthesised except that nowadays people have given it a book form.\n\nMagadhi is often considered a dialect of Hindi which has been deemed incorrect by linguists. Its true form [[Magadhi Prakrit]] later developed into languages like [[Maithili language|Maithili]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Assamese language|Assamese]] and [[Odia language|Odia]]. It has more similarity to the eastern languages than far west [[Braj]], [[Bagheli]] or [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] languages.\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Expand section|date=October 2008}}\nResearch work done in this field:\n* Dr Munishwar Jha - \"Magadhi And Its Formation,\" Calcutta Sanskrit College Research Series, 1967, 256 pp\n* Dr Saryu Prasad - \"A Descriptive Study of Magahi Phonology\", Ph.D. thesis submitted to Patna University.\n* Dr A.C.

In the inter-war years, these nationalist movements grew and often clashed with the colonial authorities when they demanded [[self-determination]].\n\n== 20th-century Southeast Asia ==\n\n=== Japanese invasion and occupations ===\n{{Further |Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere|List of territories occupied by Imperial Japan|South-East Asian theatre of World War II|Pacific War}}\n[[File:Japanese light tanks moving toward Manila.jpg|thumb|right|Japanese imperial army entering [[Manila]], January 1942.]]\nIn September 1940, following the [[Fall of France]] and pursuant to the Pacific war goals of [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]], the [[Japanese Imperial Army]]  invaded [[Japanese invasion of French Indochina|Vichy French Indochina]], which ended in the abortive [[Japanese coup de main in French Indochina]] of 9 March 1945.

After suppressing the communist insurrection during the [[Malayan Emergency]] from 1948 to 1960, Britain granted independence to [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] and later, [[Singapore]], [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] in 1957 and 1963 respectively within the framework of the [[Malaysia|Federation of Malaysia]]. In one of the most bloody single incidents of violence in Cold War Southeast Asia, General Suharto [[Overthrow of Sukarno|seized power in Indonesia]] in 1965 and initiated [[Indonesian mass killings of 1965\u20131966|a massacre]] of approximately 500,000 alleged members of the [[Communist Party of Indonesia]] (PKI).\n\nFollowing the independence of the [[Indochina]] states with the [[battle of Dien Bien Phu]], [[North Vietnam]]ese attempts to conquer [[South Vietnam]] resulted in the [[Vietnam War]]. The conflict spread to [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]] and heavy intervention from the [[United States]]. By the war's end in 1975, all these countries were controlled by communist parties. After the communist victory, two wars between communist states\u2014the [[Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War]] of 1975\u201389 and the [[Sino-Vietnamese War]] of 1979\u2014were fought in the region. The victory of the [[Khmer Rouge]] in Cambodia resulted in the [[Cambodian genocide]].<ref>Frey, Rebecca Joyce (2009).

However, independence was short-lived as Indonesia [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|annexed the territory]] soon after. However, after more than [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|20 years of fighting Indonesia]], East Timor won its independence and was recognised by the UN in 2002. Finally, Britain ended its protectorate of the Sultanate of [[Brunei]] in 1984, marking the end of European rule in Southeast Asia.\n\n==Contemporary Southeast Asia==\n[[File:ASEAN Nations Flags in Jakarta 3.jpg|thumb|right|[[ASEAN]] members' flags in [[Jakarta]].]]\nModern Southeast Asia has been characterised by high economic growth by most countries and closer regional integration. [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]] and [[Thailand]] have traditionally experienced high growth and are commonly recognised as the more developed countries of the region. As of late, [[Vietnam]] too had been experiencing an economic boom. However, [[Myanmar]], [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]] and the newly independent [[East Timor]] are still lagging economically.\n\nOn 8 August 1967, the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) was founded by Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines. Since Cambodian admission into the union in 1999, East Timor is the only Southeast Asian country that is not part of ASEAN, although plans are under way for eventual membership. The association aims to enhance co-operation among Southeast Asian community. [[ASEAN Free Trade Area]] has been established to encourage greater trade among ASEAN members. ASEAN has also been a front runner in greater integration of Asia-Pacific region through [[East Asia Summit]]s.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Buddhism in Southeast Asia]]\n* [[Hinduism in Southeast Asia]]\n* [[Islam in Southeast Asia]]\n* [[Greater India]]\n* [[Two Layer hypothesis]]\n* [[History of Brunei]]\n* [[History of Cambodia]]\n* [[History of East Timor]]\n* [[History of Indonesia]]\n* [[History of Laos]]\n* [[History of Malaysia]]\n* [[History of Myanmar]]\n* [[History of the Philippines]]\n* [[History of Singapore]]\n* [[History of Thailand]]\n* [[History of Vietnam]]\n* [[History of Asia]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|authorlink=Robin Dennell|last=Dennell|first=Robin|year=2010|chapter='Out of Africa I': Current Problems and Future Prospects|title=Out of Africa I: The First Hominin Colonization of Eurasia|series=Vertebrate Paleobiology and Paleoanthropology Series|editor-first=John G.|editor-last=Fleagle|display-editors=etal|location=Dordrecht|pages=247\u201374|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-481-9036-2|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|authorlink=Mike Morwood|last=Morwood|first=M.

Peaceful commercial relations, which give as well as receive benefits, is what the President wishes to establish with Siam, and such is the object of my mission.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mnh.si.edu/treasures/frame_exhibit_gallery1b_main.htm |title=1b.

This phenomenon, denoted [[New Imperialism]], saw the conquest of nearly all Southeast Asian territories by the colonial powers. The Dutch East India Company and British East India Company were dissolved by their respective governments, who took over the direct administration of the colonies. \n[[File:AMH-5626-NA Bird's eye view of the city of Judja.jpg|thumb|left|The map of Thai city [[Ayutthaya]] made by [[Johannes Vingboons]] a Dutch cartographer in 1665.

In the [[History of the Philippines (1521\u20131898)|Philippines]], the 1872 [[Cavite Mutiny]] was a precursor to the [[Philippine Revolution]] (1896\u20131898). When the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] began in Cuba in 1898, Filipino revolutionaries [[Philippine Declaration of Independence|declared Philippine independence]] and established the [[First Philippine Republic]] the following year. In the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris of 1898]] that ended the war with Spain, the United States gained the Philippines and other territories; in refusing to recognise the nascent republic, America effectively reversed her position of 1856. This led directly to the [[Philippine\u2013American War]], in which the First Republic was defeated; wars followed with the [[Republic of Zamboanga]], the [[Republic of Negros]] and the [[Tagalog Republic#Sakay|Republic of Katagalugan]], all of which were also defeated.\n\nColonial rule had had a profound effect on Southeast Asia. While the colonial powers profited much from the region's vast resources and large market, colonial rule did develop the region to a varying extent. Commercial agriculture, mining and an export based economy developed rapidly during this period. The introduction Christianity bought by the colonist also have profound effect in the societal change.\n\nIncreased labour demand resulted in mass immigration, especially from [[British India]] and [[China]], which brought about massive demographic change. The institutions for a modern [[nation state]] like a state bureaucracy, courts of law, print media and to a smaller extent, modern education, sowed the seeds of the fledgling [[nationalism|nationalist]]  movements in the colonial territories. In the inter-war years, these nationalist movements grew and often clashed with the colonial authorities when they demanded [[self-determination]].\n\n== 20th-century Southeast Asia ==\n\n=== Japanese invasion and occupations ===\n{{Further |Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere|List of territories occupied by Imperial Japan|South-East Asian theatre of World War II|Pacific War}}\n[[File:Japanese light tanks moving toward Manila.jpg|thumb|right|Japanese imperial army entering [[Manila]], January 1942.]]\nIn September 1940, following the [[Fall of France]] and pursuant to the Pacific war goals of [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]], the [[Japanese Imperial Army]]  invaded [[Japanese invasion of French Indochina|Vichy French Indochina]], which ended in the abortive [[Japanese coup de main in French Indochina]] of 9 March 1945.

After suppressing the communist insurrection during the [[Malayan Emergency]] from 1948 to 1960, Britain granted independence to [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] and later, [[Singapore]], [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] in 1957 and 1963 respectively within the framework of the [[Malaysia|Federation of Malaysia]]. In one of the most bloody single incidents of violence in Cold War Southeast Asia, General Suharto [[Overthrow of Sukarno|seized power in Indonesia]] in 1965 and initiated [[Indonesian mass killings of 1965\u20131966|a massacre]] of approximately 500,000 alleged members of the [[Communist Party of Indonesia]] (PKI).\n\nFollowing the independence of the [[Indochina]] states with the [[battle of Dien Bien Phu]], [[North Vietnam]]ese attempts to conquer [[South Vietnam]] resulted in the [[Vietnam War]]. The conflict spread to [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]] and heavy intervention from the [[United States]]. By the war's end in 1975, all these countries were controlled by communist parties. After the communist victory, two wars between communist states\u2014the [[Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War]] of 1975\u201389 and the [[Sino-Vietnamese War]] of 1979\u2014were fought in the region.

However, independence was short-lived as Indonesia [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|annexed the territory]] soon after. However, after more than [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|20 years of fighting Indonesia]], East Timor won its independence and was recognised by the UN in 2002. Finally, Britain ended its protectorate of the Sultanate of [[Brunei]] in 1984, marking the end of European rule in Southeast Asia.\n\n==Contemporary Southeast Asia==\n[[File:ASEAN Nations Flags in Jakarta 3.jpg|thumb|right|[[ASEAN]] members' flags in [[Jakarta]].]]\nModern Southeast Asia has been characterised by high economic growth by most countries and closer regional integration. [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]] and [[Thailand]] have traditionally experienced high growth and are commonly recognised as the more developed countries of the region. As of late, [[Vietnam]] too had been experiencing an economic boom. However, [[Myanmar]], [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]] and the newly independent [[East Timor]] are still lagging economically.\n\nOn 8 August 1967, the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) was founded by Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines. Since Cambodian admission into the union in 1999, East Timor is the only Southeast Asian country that is not part of ASEAN, although plans are under way for eventual membership. The association aims to enhance co-operation among Southeast Asian community. [[ASEAN Free Trade Area]] has been established to encourage greater trade among ASEAN members.

was held on 21 November 2010 at the [[Huagong Gymnasium]].\n\nThis [[Greco-Roman wrestling]] competition consisted of a single-elimination tournament, with a [[repechage]] used to determine the winner of two bronze medals. The two finalists faced off for gold and silver medals. Each wrestler who lost to one of the two finalists moved into the repechage, culminating in a pair of bronze medal matches featuring the semifinal losers each facing the remaining repechage opponent from their half of the bracket.\n\nEach bout consisted of up to three rounds, lasting two minutes apiece. The wrestler who scored more points in each round was the winner of that rounds; the bout finished when one wrestler had won two rounds (and thus the match).\n\n==Schedule==\n<small>All times are

The character made his debut in 2014's ''[[Dragon Age: Inquisition]]'', where he serves as a [[Party (role-playing games)|party member]]. He is an [[elf|elven]] outlaw [[Magician (fantasy)|mage]]  operating outside of the edicts of the Chantry, the dominant religious organization in Thedas, the world setting of ''Dragon Age''. His primary interest is in the Fade, a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] realm that is tied to Thedas which is normally accessible only through dreaming.\n\nSolas sought out and joined the Inquisition shortly after a massive explosion at a peace conference killed everyone present, except for the protagonist, who was discovered emerging from a [[Portal (architecture)|dimensional rift]]. This is followed by the opening of the Breach, a massive dimensional tear in the sky that allows multitudes of demonic spirits to pass through into the physical world. Solas sets himself up as the Inquisition's expert on the Fade and its denizens; his knowledge and expertise proving instrumental in aiding the organisation's struggle to close the Breach and defend the world from invaders coming through Fade rifts.\n\nSolas vanishes shortly after the defeat of Corypheus; ''Inquisition's'' post-credit scene reveals his true identity. ''Trespasser'', the final [[downloadable content|DLC pack]] released for ''Inquisition'', provides further insight into his backstory and motives, as well as his involvement in the current world state of Thedas.\n\nSolas has been positively received as a complex and well-written character. He is voiced by Welsh actor [[Gareth David-Lloyd]].\n\n==Character overview==\n{{Quote box\n| width = 25em\n| align = left\n| quote = \"Solas professed to have spent his life as an apostate, living in the wilderness well away from the civilized world. He claimed that he mastered his magic without the help of tutors, spending years exploring the spirit realm of the Fade and coming to a rare understanding of its denizens. Although his skills are beyond doubt, it has been thus far impossible to verify the rest of his history as told.\"\n| source = \u2014Character Guide<ref name=\"Kits\"/>\n}}\n\nSolas presents himself as a self-taught hedge mage who wields powers developed outside of conventional teaching and who has no affiliation with the Chantry-sanctioned Circle of Magi or any Dalish clan. He spends much of his time dreaming in ancient ruins and learning all there is to learn about what lies beyond the Veil, a metaphysical barrier which normally prevents direct physical access between the physical Thedas and the Fade.<ref name=\"Memories\"/> Solas believes in cause and effect, wisdom as its own reward and the inherent right of all free willed people to exist. Solas concludes that the many current conflicts in Thedas, such as the Mage-Templar War or the racial tensions between elves and humans, are little more than the black-and-white reductionist dichotomies which have led to the many tragedies of history.\n\nSolas sometimes speaks in [[iambic pentameter]], and the Inquisitor will gain approval when replying in kind. This is a deliberate design choice, given his characterization and personality.<ref name=\"Podcast\"/><ref name=\"Sound\"/>\n\n==Conception and creation==\n[[File:Gareth David-Lloyd by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|Gareth David-Lloyd, the voice of Solas in ''Inquisition''. He appeared as [[Ianto Jones]] in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' franchise.]]\n\nSolas was written by [[Patrick Weekes]], with heavy input from lead writer [[David Gaider]], although the character was originally conceived and named prior to Weekes joining the project.<ref name=\"Nerd\"/> In an interview, Weekes said that Solas was initially based on [[David Tennant]]'s [[Tenth Doctor|Doctor Who]] performance to capture his humanity and ancient nature.<ref>{{Citation|last=BioFan|title=BioFan Interview Patrick Weekes BioWare Lead Writer for Dragon Age|date=2016-03-17|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aj0m_eQtwXA|accessdate=2016-03-30}}</ref> Weekes noted that writing a character with hidden depths like Solas provided a great deal of both difficulty and opportunity. The character is depicted within an in-game cutscene as disdaining tea.<ref name=\"Tea\"/> Besides the fact that tea, particularly caffeinated tea, is a stimulant which may hinder Solas from crossing into the Fade during sleep, the character's dislike of tea also reflects Weekes' personal dislike of tea.<ref name=\"Nerd\"/>\n\nOriginally, Solas was not available as a romance option in ''Inquisition''; according to Mike Laidlaw, BioWare redesigned him as a potential love interest for a female elven Inquisitor when they extended the game's development for a year.<ref name=\"Romance\"/> Weekes noted that this was an opportunity to increase the basic sadness of the character.<ref name=\"Nerd\"/> Solas will initiate the breakup of his relationship with the Inquisitor at the conclusion of the romance subplot, regardless of the player's choices.<ref name=\"Heartbreak\"/>\n\nIn a video uploaded on BioWare's official YouTube channel titled \"What Makes a Good Character?\", Weekes used [[Harry Potter]] as a metaphor to explain how Solas perceives himself as the hero of the story; he feels he is \"this luckless, unfortunate person who by an unpleasant destiny and the simple fact that no one else has the ability to do it, that it has to be him and that someone else would get it wrong\".<ref name=\"Good\"/>\n \nDuring a [[wikt:Q and A|Q&A]] session at the Phoenix Fan Fest 2015, Gareth David-Lloyd revealed that he recorded voice work for Solas over a period of two and a half years. He was provided with a simple outline and some lines on a screen to work with in lieu of a comprehensive backstory for Solas; he eventually developed a stronger idea of who the character is about three or four months after he started.<ref name=\"Phoenix\"/>\n\n===Visual design===\nSolas is envisioned by Weekes to be a middle-aged man in his early to mid-forties.<ref name=\"Weekes\"/> His appearance is reflective of a wandering nomad's lifestyle, who journeys from place to place without a set destination. BioWare's designers intended Solas to appear as if he is wearing all that he owns, and that his items of clothing are meant to look like homemade improvisations born from necessity.<ref name=\"Art\"/>\n\nConcept art displayed in ''The Art of Dragon Age Inquisition'' book shows the creative process for Solas as the team develops his look after many renditions to match the ideas provided by other creative teams. After exploring many different hairstyles, the final decision was made to design Solas with a bold, bald head. This is intended to evoke a sense of ageless wisdom required by his character.<ref name=\"Art\"/> His visage is subsequently associated with that of an egg by ''Dragon Age'' fandom,<ref name=\"Hate\"/><ref name=\"FanByte\"/><ref name=\"Gaider\"/> and he has been referred to as an [[egghead]].<ref name=\"Egghead\"/>\n\n==Appearances==\n===''Inquisition''===\nSolas is encountered at the beginning of the game, fighting demons alongside [[Varric Tethras]] and a few Inquisition personnel. It is revealed that right after the calamity began where the Breach opened, Solas approached the fledgling Inquisition's leadership. He claimed that he might be able to help the sole survivor of the Divine Conclave's explosion and the suspiciously glowing mark on their hand, and that he would not stand idly by when his knowledge of the arcane could mean the difference between salvation and utter destruction. He was granted permission to study the survivor and one of the smaller rifts, in hopes of finding a way to seal the Breach and help the prisoner. Solas claims that he managed to use healing magic and minor wards to prevent the mark on the survivor's hand from growing and save their life.\n\nHe helps the Inquisitor seal a small rift shortly after their meeting, and then follows them to the Temple itself to close the first and largest rift, which he theorizes would stabilize the Breach. After the Inquisitor successfully enlists the help of either the mages or the templars, Solas assists the Inquisitor with closing the Breach itself. Following the destruction of the Inquisition's base in Haven by the Elder One, now revealed as an ancient darkspawn and formerly human magister known as Corypheus, Solas explains that the orb that he wields as a weapon is of elven origin. It is in fact one of the foci used by the elves to channel ancient magics. He worries that if the orb's origin were to be revealed, it may have negative consequences for the reputation of the elven people. He then guides the Inquisitor to Skyhold, a disused fortress located in the Frostback Mountains that the Inquisition could claim as its new headquarters.\n\nWhen the Inquisitor finally defeats Corypheus and stops him from opening another rift, with the orb being damaged permanently in the process,  Solas seems distraught and laments the destruction of the orb as the loss of yet another elven artifact. He disappears shortly afterwards, his whereabouts are completely untraceable by the Inquisition's agents. In the [[post-credits scene]] it is revealed that Solas is '''Fen'Harel''', an ancient being who is a member of the elven [[Pantheon (religion)|pantheon of gods]], and a recurring [[trickster]] figure in ''Dragon Age'' lore. The elven orb actually belonged to him; he intended to use Corypheus to unlock the orb's power, which is something he could not accomplish on his own as he had awakened from millennia of slumber in the Fade and was too weak as a result.\n\n===''Trespasser''===\nIn the midst of investigating a Qunari plot to invade Thedas, two years after the defeat of Corypheus, the Inquisitor encounters several elven ruins and learns that the elven pantheon of deities, the Evanuris were in fact extremely powerful mages as to opposed to divine beings. The Inquisitor eventually encounters the Viddasala, the Qunari leader in charge of \"Dragon's Breath\", a plot that involves Qunari sleeper agents within the Inquisition smuggling barrels of \"gaatlock\" (The Qunari version of [[gunpowder]]) into seats of power across southern Thedas, with the intention of wiping out its leadership and facilitating an invasion. She claims that the Qunari instigated it to prevent incidents like the Breach from being repeated. The Inquisitor also learn that agents supposedly working for Fen'Harel have been disrupting the Qunari plot; concurrently, the Inquisitor is losing control of the Anchor, threatening their life. The Inquisitor foils the plot and follows the Viddasala into the Eluvian network to confront Solas, despite the Anchor growing increasingly out of control.\n\nAfter petrifying the Viddasala, Solas calms the Anchor to explain himself to the Inquisitor. He confesses to being Fen'Harel, who led a rebellion against the Evanuris after they became corrupt and abused their power. He created the Veil to seal away the Evanuris after they murdered Mythal, sundering the physical world and the Fade permanently, and in doing so dooming the civilization of the ancient elves to collapse due to its dependency on magic. Remorseful over his direct role in the downfall of his people, Solas now plans to unmake the Veil he created millennia ago and restore the ancient elven world by reuniting the physical world and the Fade, being fully aware that this act may potentially destroy the world in its present state and killing countless lives in the process. He also admits to engineering the events which led to the Breach, albeit inadvertently; he had initially arranged for Corypheus to obtain his orb, anticipating that the ancient darkspawn would unlock it and destroy himself in the subsequent explosion. Solas would then retrieve the orb and use the Anchor to achieve his goal. Realizing later that Corypheus survived the orb's destructive power, he joined the Inquisition to guide the organization into defeating him and his forces. Solas also reveals that he allowed the Qunari's Dragon's Breath plot to be discovered so that the Inquisitor may thwart it, and that he has double agents working within the Inquisition, before ultimately amputating the Inquisitor's arm to prevent the Anchor from killing them and leaving. The Inquisitor may resolve to either stop Solas by any means necessary or attempt to convince him to abandon his plan.\n\nUpon returning to the Winter Palace in Orlais, the Inquisitor either disbands the Inquisition or reforms the organization into a smaller peacekeeping force to serve directly under Divine Victoria, risking weaker efforts against Solas or further infiltration in their ranks respectively. An epilogue reveals that, following the failure of the Viddasala's plot, the Qunari disavowed her actions and resumed their war with Tevinter, and that many elven individuals across Thedas have disappeared. Regardless, the Inquisitor resolves to follow through with their vow to Solas, noting his familiarity with the workings of the Inquisition and planning to recruit new allies from Tevinter.\n\n===Other appearances===\nFen'Harel's [[sobriquet]], '''The Dread Wolf''', and associated imagery is referenced by a promotional trailer released by BioWare during the 5th annual [[The Game Awards]] show in December 2018.<ref name=\"IGN\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Quote box\n| width = 25em\n| align = right\n| quote   =It doesn\u2019t surprise me at all that Solas is a popular character with a huge fanbase. There are so few characters in games that feel this real. In some twisted way, my hatred of Solas makes me a fan, inasmuch as I hope he comes back for later games and I can tell him how I really feel. I empathize with Solas. I truly understand why he is so condescending, thinks he knows the solution to everything, is dismissive of other points of view, and is a massive racist. I applaud the writers of Inquisition for their effort, and I thank them for writing a scene where I can punch Solas in the face.\n| source = \u2014Gita Jackson, ''Kotaku''<ref name=\"Hate\"/>\n}}\n\nSolas has been mostly positively received. Patricia Hernandez of ''Kotaku'' was fascinated by the [[plot (narrative)|plot twist]] in the post-credit scene of ''Inquisition'' which reveals his true identity. She observed that the reveal was a subject of intense discussion by ''Dragon Age'' fandom on social media at the time. She concludes that \"the ending is a [[cliffhanger]], and a damn good one at that\".<ref name=\"Ending\"/> Alison Stalberg from ''TheGamer.com'' rated Solas highly for his intellect, saying \"Not only did he outsmart all the characters, he created the Fade. He imprisoned the elf gods. We still do not know what else he has in store.\"<ref name=\"Intellect\"/>\n\nGita Jackson from ''[[Kotaku]]'' dislikes the character on a personal level. The opening paragraph of her opinion piece reads: \"Solas is one of the best-written characters in video games. It\u2019s hard for me to think of a character whose loathsome worldview is so well developed, who, even when he\u2019s on your side, manages to be a complete piece of shit about everything. He is a such a great character that I want to strangle that dude with my bare hands\".<ref name=\"Hate\"/> In her opinion piece published in response to Jackson's article about Solas, Angela D. Mitchell finds the character too complex, too trapped, and too tragic for her to despise. She noted that BioWare's ''Dragon Age'' universe \"inspires so many deep emotions because of the rich, complex characters that fans passionately love and hate.\" She further noted that nowhere is \"this level of emotional response more visible, however, than with the character of Solas, the ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'' (DAI) companion who is ultimately revealed to be the elven god Fen'Harel and our unexpected adversary\".<ref name=\"Love\"/>\n\nAlison Bell from ''Videogamer.com'' believed that the potential romantic relationship between Solas and the Inquisitor is the best written romance in a video game so far, although she compared it to that of a [[Shakespearean tragedy]]: \"histrionic, ruinous, and, in the long term, one or both of you is probably going to die.\"<ref name=\"Shakespeare\"/>\n\nAnalyzing the sixty-second trailer for the upcoming fourth installment of the ''Dragon Age'' series released in December 2018, Kat Brewster from ''[[IGN]]'' said \"...In true BioWare trickery, The Dread Wolf had been hiding in tapestries and lore all since ''[[Dragon Age: Origins|Origins]]''\". She called Solas \"the dear elven pal we love to hate and hate to love\".<ref name=\"IGN\"/> Since then, the character has been the focus for much of the media coverage pertaining to information released by BioWare about the [[Dragon Age#Dragon Age 4|upcoming fourth main entry]] of the ''Dragon Age'' franchise.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/><ref name=\"Everything\"/><ref name=\"PC Gamer\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Characters of Dragon Age: Inquisition|Characters of ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'']]\n*[[Elves in fiction]]\n*[[List of fictional tricksters]]\n{{Portal bar|Video games}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<!--Games-->\n<ref name=\"Memories\">{{cite video game |title=Dragon Age: Inquisition |developer=BioWare |level=Haven/Skyhold |quote='''Solas''':  Some of my fondest memories were found in crumbling cities long picked dry by treasure seekers.

Solas concludes that the many current conflicts in Thedas, such as the Mage-Templar War or the racial tensions between elves and humans, are little more than the black-and-white reductionist dichotomies which have led to the many tragedies of history.\n\nSolas sometimes speaks in [[iambic pentameter]], and the Inquisitor will gain approval when replying in kind. This is a deliberate design choice, given his characterization and personality.<ref name=\"Podcast\"/><ref name=\"Sound\"/>\n\n==Conception and creation==\n[[File:Gareth David-Lloyd by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|Gareth David-Lloyd, the voice of Solas in ''Inquisition''. He appeared as [[Ianto Jones]] in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' franchise.]]\n\nSolas was written by [[Patrick Weekes]], with heavy input from lead writer [[David Gaider]], although the character was originally conceived and named prior to Weekes joining the project.<ref name=\"Nerd\"/> In an interview, Weekes said that Solas was initially based on [[David Tennant]]'s [[Tenth Doctor|Doctor Who]] performance to capture his humanity and ancient nature.<ref>{{Citation|last=BioFan|title=BioFan Interview Patrick Weekes BioWare Lead Writer for Dragon Age|date=2016-03-17|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aj0m_eQtwXA|accessdate=2016-03-30}}</ref> Weekes noted that writing a character with hidden depths like Solas provided a great deal of both difficulty and opportunity. The character is depicted within an in-game cutscene as disdaining tea.<ref name=\"Tea\"/> Besides the fact that tea, particularly caffeinated tea, is a stimulant which may hinder Solas from crossing into the Fade during sleep, the character's dislike of tea also reflects Weekes' personal dislike of tea.<ref name=\"Nerd\"/>\n\nOriginally, Solas was not available as a romance option in ''Inquisition''; according to Mike Laidlaw, BioWare redesigned him as a potential love interest for a female elven Inquisitor when they extended the game's development for a year.<ref name=\"Romance\"/> Weekes noted that this was an opportunity to increase the basic sadness of the character.<ref name=\"Nerd\"/> Solas will initiate the breakup of his relationship with the Inquisitor at the conclusion of the romance subplot, regardless of the player's choices.<ref name=\"Heartbreak\"/>\n\nIn a video uploaded on BioWare's official YouTube channel titled \"What Makes a Good Character?\", Weekes used [[Harry Potter]] as a metaphor to explain how Solas perceives himself as the hero of the story; he feels he is \"this luckless, unfortunate person who by an unpleasant destiny and the simple fact that no one else has the ability to do it, that it has to be him and that someone else would get it wrong\".<ref name=\"Good\"/>\n \nDuring a [[wikt:Q and A|Q&A]] session at the Phoenix Fan Fest 2015, Gareth David-Lloyd revealed that he recorded voice work for Solas over a period of two and a half years. He was provided with a simple outline and some lines on a screen to work with in lieu of a comprehensive backstory for Solas; he eventually developed a stronger idea of who the character is about three or four months after he started.<ref name=\"Phoenix\"/>\n\n===Visual design===\nSolas is envisioned by Weekes to be a middle-aged man in his early to mid-forties.<ref name=\"Weekes\"/> His appearance is reflective of a wandering nomad's lifestyle, who journeys from place to place without a set destination. BioWare's designers intended Solas to appear as if he is wearing all that he owns, and that his items of clothing are meant to look like homemade improvisations born from necessity.<ref name=\"Art\"/>\n\nConcept art displayed in ''The Art of Dragon Age Inquisition'' book shows the creative process for Solas as the team develops his look after many renditions to match the ideas provided by other creative teams. After exploring many different hairstyles, the final decision was made to design Solas with a bold, bald head. This is intended to evoke a sense of ageless wisdom required by his character.<ref name=\"Art\"/> His visage is subsequently associated with that of an egg by ''Dragon Age'' fandom,<ref name=\"Hate\"/><ref name=\"FanByte\"/><ref name=\"Gaider\"/> and he has been referred to as an [[egghead]].<ref name=\"Egghead\"/>\n\n==Appearances==\n===''Inquisition''===\nSolas is encountered at the beginning of the game, fighting demons alongside [[Varric Tethras]] and a few Inquisition personnel. It is revealed that right after the calamity began where the Breach opened, Solas approached the fledgling Inquisition's leadership. He claimed that he might be able to help the sole survivor of the Divine Conclave's explosion and the suspiciously glowing mark on their hand, and that he would not stand idly by when his knowledge of the arcane could mean the difference between salvation and utter destruction. He was granted permission to study the survivor and one of the smaller rifts, in hopes of finding a way to seal the Breach and help the prisoner. Solas claims that he managed to use healing magic and minor wards to prevent the mark on the survivor's hand from growing and save their life.\n\nHe helps the Inquisitor seal a small rift shortly after their meeting, and then follows them to the Temple itself to close the first and largest rift, which he theorizes would stabilize the Breach. After the Inquisitor successfully enlists the help of either the mages or the templars, Solas assists the Inquisitor with closing the Breach itself. Following the destruction of the Inquisition's base in Haven by the Elder One, now revealed as an ancient darkspawn and formerly human magister known as Corypheus, Solas explains that the orb that he wields as a weapon is of elven origin. It is in fact one of the foci used by the elves to channel ancient magics. He worries that if the orb's origin were to be revealed, it may have negative consequences for the reputation of the elven people. He then guides the Inquisitor to Skyhold, a disused fortress located in the Frostback Mountains that the Inquisition could claim as its new headquarters.\n\nWhen the Inquisitor finally defeats Corypheus and stops him from opening another rift, with the orb being damaged permanently in the process,  Solas seems distraught and laments the destruction of the orb as the loss of yet another elven artifact. He disappears shortly afterwards, his whereabouts are completely untraceable by the Inquisition's agents. In the [[post-credits scene]] it is revealed that Solas is '''Fen'Harel''', an ancient being who is a member of the elven [[Pantheon (religion)|pantheon of gods]], and a recurring [[trickster]] figure in ''Dragon Age'' lore. The elven orb actually belonged to him; he intended to use Corypheus to unlock the orb's power, which is something he could not accomplish on his own as he had awakened from millennia of slumber in the Fade and was too weak as a result.\n\n===''Trespasser''===\nIn the midst of investigating a Qunari plot to invade Thedas, two years after the defeat of Corypheus, the Inquisitor encounters several elven ruins and learns that the elven pantheon of deities, the Evanuris were in fact extremely powerful mages as to opposed to divine beings. The Inquisitor eventually encounters the Viddasala, the Qunari leader in charge of \"Dragon's Breath\", a plot that involves Qunari sleeper agents within the Inquisition smuggling barrels of \"gaatlock\" (The Qunari version of [[gunpowder]]) into seats of power across southern Thedas, with the intention of wiping out its leadership and facilitating an invasion. She claims that the Qunari instigated it to prevent incidents like the Breach from being repeated. The Inquisitor also learn that agents supposedly working for Fen'Harel have been disrupting the Qunari plot; concurrently, the Inquisitor is losing control of the Anchor, threatening their life. The Inquisitor foils the plot and follows the Viddasala into the Eluvian network to confront Solas, despite the Anchor growing increasingly out of control.\n\nAfter petrifying the Viddasala, Solas calms the Anchor to explain himself to the Inquisitor. He confesses to being Fen'Harel, who led a rebellion against the Evanuris after they became corrupt and abused their power. He created the Veil to seal away the Evanuris after they murdered Mythal, sundering the physical world and the Fade permanently, and in doing so dooming the civilization of the ancient elves to collapse due to its dependency on magic. Remorseful over his direct role in the downfall of his people, Solas now plans to unmake the Veil he created millennia ago and restore the ancient elven world by reuniting the physical world and the Fade, being fully aware that this act may potentially destroy the world in its present state and killing countless lives in the process. He also admits to engineering the events which led to the Breach, albeit inadvertently; he had initially arranged for Corypheus to obtain his orb, anticipating that the ancient darkspawn would unlock it and destroy himself in the subsequent explosion. Solas would then retrieve the orb and use the Anchor to achieve his goal. Realizing later that Corypheus survived the orb's destructive power, he joined the Inquisition to guide the organization into defeating him and his forces. Solas also reveals that he allowed the Qunari's Dragon's Breath plot to be discovered so that the Inquisitor may thwart it, and that he has double agents working within the Inquisition, before ultimately amputating the Inquisitor's arm to prevent the Anchor from killing them and leaving. The Inquisitor may resolve to either stop Solas by any means necessary or attempt to convince him to abandon his plan.\n\nUpon returning to the Winter Palace in Orlais, the Inquisitor either disbands the Inquisition or reforms the organization into a smaller peacekeeping force to serve directly under Divine Victoria, risking weaker efforts against Solas or further infiltration in their ranks respectively. An epilogue reveals that, following the failure of the Viddasala's plot, the Qunari disavowed her actions and resumed their war with Tevinter, and that many elven individuals across Thedas have disappeared. Regardless, the Inquisitor resolves to follow through with their vow to Solas, noting his familiarity with the workings of the Inquisition and planning to recruit new allies from Tevinter.\n\n===Other appearances===\nFen'Harel's [[sobriquet]], '''The Dread Wolf''', and associated imagery is referenced by a promotional trailer released by BioWare during the 5th annual [[The Game Awards]] show in December 2018.<ref name=\"IGN\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Quote box\n| width = 25em\n| align = right\n| quote   =It doesn\u2019t surprise me at all that Solas is a popular character with a huge fanbase. There are so few characters in games that feel this real. In some twisted way, my hatred of Solas makes me a fan, inasmuch as I hope he comes back for later games and I can tell him how I really feel. I empathize with Solas. I truly understand why he is so condescending, thinks he knows the solution to everything, is dismissive of other points of view, and is a massive racist. I applaud the writers of Inquisition for their effort, and I thank them for writing a scene where I can punch Solas in the face.\n| source = \u2014Gita Jackson, ''Kotaku''<ref name=\"Hate\"/>\n}}\n\nSolas has been mostly positively received. Patricia Hernandez of ''Kotaku'' was fascinated by the [[plot (narrative)|plot twist]] in the post-credit scene of ''Inquisition'' which reveals his true identity. She observed that the reveal was a subject of intense discussion by ''Dragon Age'' fandom on social media at the time. She concludes that \"the ending is a [[cliffhanger]], and a damn good one at that\".<ref name=\"Ending\"/> Alison Stalberg from ''TheGamer.com'' rated Solas highly for his intellect, saying \"Not only did he outsmart all the characters, he created the Fade. He imprisoned the elf gods. We still do not know what else he has in store.\"<ref name=\"Intellect\"/>\n\nGita Jackson from ''[[Kotaku]]'' dislikes the character on a personal level. The opening paragraph of her opinion piece reads: \"Solas is one of the best-written characters in video games. It\u2019s hard for me to think of a character whose loathsome worldview is so well developed, who, even when he\u2019s on your side, manages to be a complete piece of shit about everything. He is a such a great character that I want to strangle that dude with my bare hands\".<ref name=\"Hate\"/> In her opinion piece published in response to Jackson's article about Solas, Angela D. Mitchell finds the character too complex, too trapped, and too tragic for her to despise. She noted that BioWare's ''Dragon Age'' universe \"inspires so many deep emotions because of the rich, complex characters that fans passionately love and hate.\" She further noted that nowhere is \"this level of emotional response more visible, however, than with the character of Solas, the ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'' (DAI) companion who is ultimately revealed to be the elven god Fen'Harel and our unexpected adversary\".<ref name=\"Love\"/>\n\nAlison Bell from ''Videogamer.com'' believed that the potential romantic relationship between Solas and the Inquisitor is the best written romance in a video game so far, although she compared it to that of a [[Shakespearean tragedy]]: \"histrionic, ruinous, and, in the long term, one or both of you is probably going to die.\"<ref name=\"Shakespeare\"/>\n\nAnalyzing the sixty-second trailer for the upcoming fourth installment of the ''Dragon Age'' series released in December 2018, Kat Brewster from ''[[IGN]]'' said \"...In true BioWare trickery, The Dread Wolf had been hiding in tapestries and lore all since ''[[Dragon Age: Origins|Origins]]''\". She called Solas \"the dear elven pal we love to hate and hate to love\".<ref name=\"IGN\"/> Since then, the character has been the focus for much of the media coverage pertaining to information released by BioWare about the [[Dragon Age#Dragon Age 4|upcoming fourth main entry]] of the ''Dragon Age'' franchise.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/><ref name=\"Everything\"/><ref name=\"PC Gamer\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Characters of Dragon Age: Inquisition|Characters of ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'']]\n*[[Elves in fiction]]\n*[[List of fictional tricksters]]\n{{Portal bar|Video games}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<!--Games-->\n<ref name=\"Memories\">{{cite video game |title=Dragon Age: Inquisition |developer=BioWare |level=Haven/Skyhold |quote='''Solas''':  Some of my fondest memories were found in crumbling cities long picked dry by treasure seekers.

These locations are today part of the nations of [[Malaysia]] (Malay [[nation state]]), [[Brunei]], [[Singapore]], [[Indonesia]] and Southern [[Thailand]].\n\nThere is considerable genetic, linguistic, cultural, artistic, and social diversity among the many Malay subgroups, mainly due to hundreds of years of immigration and assimilation of various regional ethnicity and tribes within [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. Historically, the Malay population is descended primarily from the earlier [[Malayic languages|Malayic]]-speaking Austronesians and [[Austroasiatic]] tribes who founded several ancient maritime trading states and kingdoms, notably [[History of Brunei|Brunei]], [[Kedah Kingdom|Kedah]], [[Langkasuka]], [[Gangga Negara]], [[Chi Tu]], [[Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom|Nakhon Si Thammarat]], [[Old Pahang Kingdom|Pahang]], [[Melayu Kingdom|Melayu]] and [[Srivijaya]].<ref>{{harvnb|Milner|2010|pp=24, 33}}</ref><ref name=\"Barnard 2004 7\">{{harvnb|Barnard|2004|p=7&60}}</ref>\n\nThe advent of the [[Malacca Sultanate]] in the 15th century triggered a major revolution in Malay history, the significance of which lies in its far-reaching political and cultural legacy.

These ancient people also split with some heading to [[Sulawesi]] and others progressing into [[Java]], and [[Sumatra]], all of which now speak languages that belong to the Austronesian Language family. The final migration was to the Malay Peninsula roughly 3,000 years ago. A sub-group from Borneo moved to Champa in modern-day Central and South Vietnam roughly 4,500 years ago.

Founded in 535 BC, it is among the oldest testament of [[civilisation]] in [[Southeast Asia]] and a potential progenitor of the [[Kedah Tua]] kingdom.\n\nIt was home to a society with its own culture, philosophy, religion and trade. The historical landscape of the area was bound to a flourishing iron industry, with archaeological findings unearthed various historical mines, warehouses, factories, a harbour; together with a vibrant plethora of superior-quality [[ores]], [[furnace]], [[slag]] and [[ingot]]s. Additionally, the peculiar [[Tuyere]] iron-[[smelting]] technique mobilised in Sungai Batu is hailed as oldest of its kind in the world. The produce was highly sought after and exported to various corners of the [[Old World]], including ancient [[India]], [[China]], [[Middle East]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]]. Based on early [[Sanskrit]] reports, the area was known as \"the iron bowl\".<ref name=\"Pearson 2015\"/><ref name=\"Hall 2017\"/>\n\nThe settlement also narrated a glimpse of the ancient religious undertakings prior to the mass [[Greater India#Indianised kingdoms|Indianisation]] of the region. The early inhabitants of the [[Malay Archipelago]] was chronicled to be the adherence of indigenous [[animism]] and [[shamanism]]. The ancient folk religion vividly characterised that every elements of nature possessed a spirit, known as ''semangat''. The ''semangat'' has the governing power to richly blessed or mercilessly cursed the society, hence the spirit should always be pleased and entertained. In Sungai Batu, archaeological evidence unmasked several ceremonial and religious architectures devoted for the sun and mountain worshiping.<ref name=\"Pearson 2015\"/><ref name=\"Hall 2017\"/>\n\nIn addition to Sungai Batu, the early Malay archipelago also witnessed the monumental development of other subsequent ancient large urban settlements and regional polities, driven by a predominantly cosmopolitan agrarian society, thriving skilled craftsmanship, multinational merchants and foreign expatriates. Chinese records noted the names of Akola, [[Pan Pan (kingdom)|P\u2019an P\u2019an]], Tun-Sun, [[History of Kedah|Chieh-ch'a]], [[Chi Tu|Ch'ih-tu]], among few. Upon the fifth century AD, these settlements had morphed into a [[sovereignty|sovereign]] [[city-states]], collectively fashioned by an active participation in the international trade network and hosting diplomatic embassies from China and India.<ref name=\"Pearson 2015\"/><ref name=\"Hall 2017\"/>\n\n===Indian influence===\n{{Further|Greater India}}\n[[File:Malay Kingdoms en.svg|thumb|Early Malayic and pre-Malayic-speaking areas, classical kingdoms and urban settlements preceding the rise of Srivijaya in the 7th century and prior to the eastward [[Malayisation|Malay cultural expansion]] to the shores of Borneo.

The discovery of jetty remains, iron smelting sites, and a clay brick monument dating back to 110&nbsp;CE in the [[Bujang Valley]], shows that a maritime trading route with South Indian [[Tamil Nadu|Tamil kingdoms]] was already established since the second century.<ref>{{harvnb|Devan|2010}}</ref>\n\nThe growth of trade with India brought coastal people in much of maritime Southeast Asia into contact with the major religions of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. Throughout this area a most profound in influence has been exerted by India which seems to have introduced into it architecture, sculpture, writing, monarchy, religion, iron, cotton and a host of elements of higher culture. Indian religions, cultural traditions and [[Sanskrit]] began to spread across the land. [[Hindu temple]]s were built in the Indian style, local kings began referring to themselves as \"[[raja]]\" and more desirable aspects of Indian government were adopted.<ref name=\"zaki1\">{{harvnb|Zaki Ragman|2003|pp=1\u20136}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nakhon Si Thammarat Chedi Phra Baromathat.jpg|thumb|left|''Chedi Phra Borommathat'', a [[stupa]] located in [[Nakhon Si Thammarat]], [[Thailand]].

Between the 7th and 13th centuries, many of these small, often prosperous peninsula and Sumatran maritime trading states, became part of the [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|mandala]] of Srivijaya,<ref>{{harvnb|Sabrizain|2006}}</ref> a great confederation of city-states centred in [[Palembang]],<ref>{{harvnb|Munoz|2006|p=171}}</ref> [[Kedah|Kadaram]],<ref>{{harvnb|Muljana|2006}}</ref> [[Chaiya District|Chaiya]] and [[Tambralinga]].\n\nSrivijaya's influence spread over all the coastal areas of Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula, western [[Java]] and western [[Borneo]], as well as the rest of the [[Malay Archipelago]]. Enjoying both Indian and Chinese patronage, its wealth was gained mostly through trade. At its height, the [[Old Malay language]] was used as its official language and became the [[lingua franca]] of the region, replacing Sanskrit, the language of Hinduism.<ref name=\"zaki1\" /> The Srivijayan era is considered the golden age of Malay culture.\n\nThe glory of Srivijaya however began to wane after the series of raids by the Indian [[Chola dynasty]] in the 11th century. By the end of the 13th century, the remnants of the Malay empire in [[Sumatra]] was finally destroyed by the [[Javanese people|Javanese invaders]] during the [[Pamalayu expedition]] (''Pamalayu'' means \"war against the Malays\").\n\nThe complete destruction of Srivijaya caused the diaspora of the Srivijayan princes and nobles. Rebellions against the Javanese rule ensued and attempts were made by the fleeing Malay princes to revive the empire, which left the area of southern Sumatra in chaos and desolation. In 1299, through the support of the loyal servants of the empire, the [[Orang laut]]s, a Malay prince of Srivijaya origin, [[Sang Nila Utama]] established the [[Kingdom of Singapura]] in [[Temasek]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ministry of Culture|1973|p=9}}</ref> His dynasty ruled the island kingdom until the end of the 14th century, when the Malay polity once again faced the wrath of Javanese invaders.

Between the 13th to early 14th century, the kingdom succeeded to incorporate most of the Malay Peninsula under its mandala. The campaign led by [[Chandrabhanu Sridhamaraja]] (1230\u20131263) managed to capture [[Jaffna kingdom]] in [[Sri Lanka]] between 1247 and 1258. He was eventually defeated by the forces of the [[Pandyan dynasty]] from Tamil Nadu in 1263 and was killed by the brother of Emperor [[Sadayavarman Sundara Pandyan I]].<ref>India's interaction with Southeast Asia, by Govind Chandra Pande p.286</ref> The invasion marked an unrivaled feature in the [[history of Southeast Asia]], it was the only time there was an armed maritime expedition beyond the borders of the region.\n\nThe cultivation of Malay polity system also diffused beyond the proper Sumatran-Peninsular border during this era. The age avowed by exploration and migration of the Malays to establish kingdoms beyond the traditional Srivijayan realm. Several exemplification are the enthronement of a Tambralingan prince to reign the [[Lavo Kingdom]] in present-day [[Central Thailand]], the foundation of [[Rajahnate of Cebu]] in the [[Visayas]] and the establishment of the [[Tanjungpura Kingdom]] in what is now [[West Kalimantan]], [[Borneo]]. The expansion is also eminent as it shaped the [[ethnogenesis]] development of the related [[Acehnese people|Acehnese]] and [[Banjar people]] and further spreading the Indian-influenced Malay ethos within the regional sphere.\n\n===Islamisation===\n{{Further|Spread of Islam in Southeast Asia|Malayisation}}\n[[File:Patung Dayak Melayu.jpg|thumb|The \"Dayak-Malay\" brotherhood monument in West Kalimantan Provincial Museum, [[Pontianak]], Indonesia.

By the middle of the 15th century, Brunei entered into a close relationship with the Malacca Sultanate. The sultan married a Malaccan princess, adopted Islam as the court religion, and introduced an efficient administration modelled on Malacca.<ref>{{harvnb|Europa Publications Staff|2002|p=203}}</ref> Brunei profited from trade with Malacca but gained even greater prosperity after the great Malay port was conquered by the Portuguese in 1511. It reached its golden age in the mid-16th century when it controlled land as far south as present day [[Kuching]] in [[Sarawak]], north towards the [[Philippine Archipelago]].<ref>{{harvnb|Richmond|2007|p=32}}</ref> The empire broadened its influence in [[Luzon]] by defeating Datu Gambang of the [[Kingdom of Tondo]] and by founding a [[Satellite state|satellite]] state, [[Kota Seludong]] in present-day [[Manila]], setting up the Muslim Rajah, [[Rajah Sulaiman I]] as a vassal to the Sultanate of Brunei. Brunei also expanded its influence in Mindanao, [[Philippines]] when Sultan Bolkiah married Leila Macanai, the daughter of the [[Sultanate of Sulu|Sultan of Sulu]]. However, states like the [[Huangdom of Pangasinan]], [[Rajahnate of Cebu]] and [[Kedatuan of Madja-as]] tried to resist Brunei's and Islam's spread into the Philippines. Brunei's fairly loose river based governmental presence in Borneo projected the process of [[Malayisation]]. Fine Malay Muslim cultures, including the language, dress and single-family dwelling were introduced to the natives primarily from ethnic [[Dayak people|Dayaks]], drawing them into the Sultanate. Dayak chiefs were incorporated into the Malay hierarchy, being given the official titles of ''[[Datuk]]'', ''[[Temenggong]]'' and ''Orang Kaya''. In [[West Kalimantan|West Borneo]], the development of such sultanates of [[Sarawak Sultanate|Sarawak]], [[Sultanate of Sambas|Sambas]], [[Sukadana]] and [[Landak Regency|Landak]] tells a similar tale of recruitment among Dayak people.<ref>{{harvnb|Milner|2010|pp=82\u201384}}</ref>\n\nOther significant Malay sultanates were the [[Kedah Sultanate]] (1136\u2013present), [[Kelantan|Kelantan Sultanate]] (1411\u2013present), [[Pattani Kingdom|Patani Sultanate]] (1516\u20131771), [[Reman Sultanate]] (1785\u20131909) and [[Legeh Sultanate]] (1755\u20131902) that dominated the northern part of the Malay peninsula. [[Jambi Sultanate]] (1460\u20131907), [[Palembang Sultanate]] (1550\u20131823) and [[Indragiri Sultanate]] (1298\u20131945) controlled much of the southeastern shores of Sumatra.

While West Borneo observed the rise of [[Pontianak Sultanate]] (1771\u20131950), Mempawah Sultanate (1740\u20131950) and Matam Sultanate (1590\u20131948)\n\n===Colonisation by foreign powers===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Portret van de Sultan van Lingga Riouw met zijn gevolg Batavia TMnr 60003185.jpg|thumb|The reigning elite of the [[Riau-Lingga Sultanate]], together with the Sultan (being seated, in the middle) as depicted in this photograph taken in 1867.

The sultanate would be abolished almost half a century later in 1911 by the Dutch powers, following a strong independence movement manifested in the nation against the [[Dutch East Indies|colonial government]].]]\n\nBetween 1511 and 1984, numerous Malay kingdoms and sultanates fell under direct [[colonisation]] or became the [[protectorate]]s of different foreign powers, from European colonial powers like [[Portugal|Portuguese]], [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[United Kingdom|British]], to regional powers like [[Siam]] and [[Japan]].\nIn 1511, the [[Portuguese Empire]] [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|captured]] the capital city of the [[Malacca Sultanate]]. The victorious Portuguese however, were unable to extend their political influence beyond the [[A Famosa|fort of Malacca]]. The Sultan maintained his overlordship on the lands outside Malacca and established the [[Johor Sultanate]] in 1528 to succeed Malacca. [[Portuguese Malacca]] faced several unsuccessful retaliation attacks by Johor until 1614, when the combined forces of Johor and the [[Dutch Empire]], [[Battle of Malacca (1641)|ousted]] the Portuguese from the peninsula. As per agreement with Johor in 1606, the Dutch later took control of Malacca.<ref>{{harvnb|Hunter|Roberts|2010|p=345}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, [[Malay states]] of the peninsular had a hostile relation with the [[Thai people|Siamese]]. Malacca sultanate herself fought two wars with the Siamese while northern Malay states came intermittently under Siamese dominance for centuries. In 1771, the [[Thonburi Kingdom|Kingdom of Siam]] under the new [[Chakri Dynasty]] abolished the [[Pattani Kingdom|Pattani Sultanate]] and later annexed a large part of [[Kedah Sultanate]]. Earlier, the Siamese under [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] have had already absorbed [[Tambralinga]] and overrun the [[Singgora Sultanate]] in the 17th century. Between 1808\u20131813, the Siamese imposed a new administrative structure and created the [[Satellite state|semi-independent]] Malay kingdoms of [[Pattani Kingdom|Patani]], [[Sai Buri District|Saiburi]], [[Nong Chik District|Nongchik]], [[Yaring District|Yaring]], [[Yala Province|Yala]], [[Reman]] and [[Rangae]] from [[Patani (region)|Greater Pattani]] and similarly obtained [[Ranong province|Rundung]], [[Takua Pa District|Kupa]], [[Phuket province|Tongkah]], [[Trang Province|Terang]] while carving [[Setul Kingdom|Setul]], Langu, [[Perlis]], [[Kubang Pasu Kingdom|Kubang Pasu]] from the [[Kedah Kingdom]] in 1839.<ref>{{harvnb|Andaya|Andaya|1984|pp=62\u201368}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Ganguly|1997|p=204}}</ref> In 1902, the Siamese stripped the political powers of all the 7 kingdoms of Pattani following a planned revolt for independence against the central government.

In 1819, the company also acquired [[Singapore]] from [[Johor Empire]], later in 1824, [[Dutch Malacca]] from the Dutch, and followed by [[Straits Settlements#Dindings and Province Wellesley|Dindings]] from [[Perak]] by 1874. All these trading posts officially known as [[Straits Settlements]] in 1826 and became the crown colony of [[British Empire]] in 1867. British intervention in the affairs of Malay states was formalised in 1895, when [[Malay rulers]] accepted [[British Resident]]s in administration, and the [[Federated Malay States]] was formed. In 1909, [[Kedah]], [[Kelantan]], [[Terengganu]] and [[Perlis]] were [[Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909|handed over]] by Siam to the British. These states along with [[Johor]], later became known as [[Unfederated Malay States]]. During the [[World War II]], all these British possessions and protectorates that collectively known as [[British Malaya]] were occupied by the [[Empire of Japan]].\n\nThe twilight of the vast Bruneian Empire began during the [[Castille War]] against the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] conquistadors which arrived at the Philippines from Mexico. The war resulted in the end of the empire's dominance in the present-day [[Philippine archipelago]]. The decline further culminated in the 19th century, when the Sultanate lost most of its remaining territories in [[Borneo]] to the [[White Rajah]]s of [[Sarawak]], [[North Borneo Chartered Company]] and its [[Kalimantan|lower Borneo]] vassals to [[Dutch East India Company]]. Brunei was a British protectorate from 1888 to 1984.<ref name=\"CIA (B)\">{{harvnb|CIA World Factbook|t=Brunei|2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]] which divided the [[Malay Archipelago]] into a British zone in the north and a Dutch zone in the south, all Malay sultanates in [[Sumatra]] and [[Kalimantan|Southern Borneo]] became part of the [[Dutch East Indies]]. Though some of Malay sultans maintain their power under Dutch control,<ref>{{harvnb|Lumholtz|2004|p=17}}</ref> some were abolished by the Dutch government under the accusation of retaliation against the colonial rule, like the case of Palembang Sultanate in 1823, Jambi Sultanate in 1906 and [[Riau Sultanate]] in 1911.\n\n[[File:Sultans at the first Malayan Durbar.jpg|thumb|The [[Malay Rulers]] and nobilities of Negeri Sembilan, Pahang, Perak and Selangor with [[British Malaya|British colonial officers]] during the first [[Conference of Rulers|Durbar]] in Istana Negara, [[Kuala Kangsar]], [[Perak]], [[Federated Malay States]], 1897.]]\nA similar partition of the [[Malay Peninsular|Peninsular]] was also replicated by the British and the Siamese in wake of the [[Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909]]. This was done after the British alarmed by the growing influence between Siamese government and rivaling [[German colonial empire]], especially in the northern Peninsular. The Anglo-Siamese Treaty attested that the Siamese to control the [[Southern Thailand|upper portion]] of the peninsular while the lower region was to be held under the [[British Empire|British dominance]]. The British originally planned for the inclusion of [[Kingdom of Reman|Reman]], Legeh and [[Kingdom of Setul|Setul]] under their dominion together with a cluster of northern Malay states. Nonetheless, they only managed to secure [[Kedah]], [[Kelantan]], [[Terengganu]] and [[Perlis]] under the agreement. The treaty also witnessed the state of Kedah being reduced the most, with [[Tarutao National Park|Tarutao]], [[Tarutao National Park|Butang islands]] groups, [[Sadao District|Sendawa]], [[La-ngu District|Langgu]] and the principality of [[Setul Kingdom|Setul]] were all being divorced into the Siamese hands, a similar fate was also followed in northeastern coast of Kelantan that was demanded to renounced their right on the [[Tak Bai District|Tabal district]], including [[Su-ngai Kolok District|Sungai Golok]] and [[Su-ngai Padi District|Sungai Padi]]; while [[Perlis]] lost its Pujoh district. Then-British controlled [[Federated Malay States|Federated Malay State]] of [[Perak]] however, saw an enlargement of their land area, with [[Hulu Perak|southern territories]] of [[Reman]] being transferred into the state and additionally Kelantan received [[Jeli District|Jeli]] from Legeh (which had been under Siamese jurisdiction since 1902). The Siamese then [[abdicated]] Tunku Baharuddin, the [[Kingdom of Setul Mambang Segara|King of Setul]], the sole Malay kingdom remained under Siamese territory in 1916. The treaty nonetheless, manage to sealed the fate of the Malay states of [[Kedah]], [[Kelantan]], [[Terengganu]] and [[Perlis]] to retain a degree of their sovereign powers under the [[British Malaya|British colonial government]], a legacy that can be witnessed today in the Malaysian administrative system.\n\nLater during the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies]], [[Japanese occupation of Malaya|British Malaya]] and [[Japanese occupation of British Borneo|Borneo]], the Japanese maintained a favourable relationship with the Sultans and other Malay leaders, this is partially composed to foster the trust of the Malay public that was generally loyal towards the sultan. Nonetheless, in a series of massacres known as [[Pontianak incidents]], the Japanese assassinated virtually all of the [[West Kalimantan]] Malay sultans, including a large numbers of Malay intelligentsias after they have been falsely accused of planning an uprising and [[coup d'etat]] against the Japanese. It was believed that West Kalimantan took two generations to recover from the near-total collapse of the Malay ruling class in the territory.\n\n===Malay nationalism===\n[[File:TuahNatlHistoryMuseumKL.jpg|thumb|The bronze mural of the legendary Malay warrior, [[Hang Tuah]] with his renowned quote ''Ta' Melayu Hilang Di-Dunia'' ([[Malay language|Malay]] for \"Never shall the Malays vanish from the face of the earth\") written on the top.

In the [[Netherlands Indies]], the struggle against colonisation was characterised by the trans-ethnic nationalism: the so-called \"[[Indonesian National Awakening]]\" united people from the various parts of the Dutch colony in the development of a national consciousness as \"Indonesians\".<ref name=\"Ricklefs, pp. 163-164\">Ricklefs, pp. 163\u2013164.</ref> In Brunei, despite some attempt made to arouse Malay political consciousness between 1942 and 1945, there was no significant history of ethnic-based nationalism. In Thailand however, [[South Thailand insurgency|Pattani separatism]] against Thai rule is regarded by some historians as a part of the wider sphere of peninsula Malay nationalism. A similar [[secession movement]] can be witnessed in modern-day Indonesia, where both autochthonously-Malay provinces of [[Riau]] and [[Riau Islands]] sought to gain independence under the name of Republic of Riau. Nevertheless, what follows is specific to the peninsula Malay nationalism that resulted in the formation of the [[Federation of Malaya]], later reconstituted as Malaysia.\n\nThe earliest and most influential instruments of Malay national awakening were the [[periodical]]s which politicised the position of the Malays in the face of colonialism and alien immigration of non-Malays. In spite of repressions imposed by the British colonial government, there were no less than 147 journals and newspapers published in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] between 1876 and 1941. Among notable periodicals were ''Al-Imam'' (1906), ''Pengasuh'' (1920), ''Majlis'' (1935) and ''[[Utusan Melayu]]'' (1939). The rise of [[Malay nationalism]] was largely mobilised by three nationalist factions \u2013 the radicals distinguishable into the Malay left and the Islamic group which were both opposed to the conservative elites.<ref name=\"Leo Suryadinata\">{{harvnb|Suryadinata|2000|pp=133\u2013136}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Malaya stamp.png|thumb|left|Federation of Malaya's commemorative stamp issued in 1957.

In 1945, they reorganised themselves into a political party known as Partai Kebangsaan Melayu Malaya (PKMM). The [[Islamist]]s were originally represented by ''Kaum Muda'' consisted of Middle east \u2013educated scholars with [[Pan-Islamism|Pan-Islamic]] sentiment. The first Islamic political party was ''Partai Orang Muslimin Malaya'' (Hizbul Muslimin) formed in March 1948, later succeeded by [[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party|Pan-Malayan Islamic Party]] in 1951. The third group was [[Conservatism|the conservatives]] consisted of the westernised elites who were bureaucrats and members of royal families that shared a common English education mostly at the exclusive [[Malay College Kuala Kangsar]]. They formed voluntary organisations known as ''Persatuan Melayu'' ('Malay Associations') in various parts of the country with the primary goals of advancing and protecting the interests of Malays. In March 1946, 41 of these Malay associations formed [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), to assert [[Malay dominance]] over Malaya.<ref name=\"Leo Suryadinata\"/>\n\nThe Malay and [[Malayness]] has been the fundamental basis for Malay ideology and Malay nationalism in Malaysia. All three Malay nationalist factions believed in the idea of a ''Bangsa Melayu'' ('Malay Nation') and the position of Malay language, but disagreed over the role of Islam and Malay rulers. The conservatives supported [[Malay language]], [[Malay Islamic identity|Islam]] and [[Malay rulers|Malay monarchy]] as constituting the key pillars of Malayness, but within a secular state that restricted the political role of Islam. The leftists concurred with the [[secular state]] but wanted to end [[feudalism]], whereas the Islamic group favoured ending royalty but sought a much larger role of [[Islam]].<ref>{{harvnb|Barrington|2006|pp=47\u201348}}</ref>\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Spandoeken tijdens het bezoek van de Wali Negara Sumatera Timur aan Pematangsiantar TMnr 60024766.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Supporters of ''Negara Soematra Timoer'' ([[State of East Sumatra]]) that sought to maintain the monarchy system in [[Aftermath of World War II#Dutch East Indies|post-World War II]] Dutch-established territory of East Sumatra.

An adapted Arabic script called [[Jawi script|Jawi]] was used replacing the Indian script, Islamic religious and cultural terminologies were abundantly assimilated, discarding many Hindu-Buddhist words, and Malay became the language of Islamic medium of instruction and dissemination throughout Southeast Asian region.

Among the forms of poetry in Malay literature are \u2013 the [[Pantun]], [[Syair]] and [[Gurindam]].\n\nThe earliest form of Malay literature was the [[oral literature]] and its central subjects are traditional [[folklore]] relating to [[nature]], animals and people. The classical Malay folklore is composed of traditional songs and music, heroic poems, animal fables, ghost stories, past events, fairy tales, symbolic lore, myths and bardic tales. Each of the stories possessed its own energy in terms of character, spirit, backdrop and storytelling and was largely crafted with the intend of happiness, guidance, educating, reminiscing, explaining, among few. The folklore were memorised and passed from one generation of storytellers to the next. Many of these tales were also written down by ''penglipur lara'' (storytellers) for example: ''[[Hikayat Malim Dewa]]'', ''Hikayat Malim Deman'', ''Hikayat Raja Donan'', ''Hikayat Anggun Cik Tunggal'', and ''[[Hikayat Awang Sulung Merah Muda]]''.\n\nWhen Indian influences made their way to the Malay Archipelago around 2000 years ago, Malay literature began incorporating Indian elements. Literature of this time is mostly translations of [[Sanskrit literature]] and romances, or at least some productions inspired by such, and is full of allusions to [[Hindu mythology]]. Probably to this early time may be traced such works as ''[[Hikayat Seri Rama]]'' (a free translation of the ''[[Ramayana]]''), ''[[Hikayat Bayan Budiman]]'' (an adaptation of [[\u015aukasaptati]]) and ''[[Hikayat Panca Tanderan]]'' (an adaptation of ''[[Hitopadesha]]'').<ref name=\"popular science 1899\">{{harvnb|Ford|1899|pp=379\u2013381}}</ref>\n\nThe era of classical Malay literature started after the arrival of Islam and the invention of [[Jawi script]] (Arabic based Malay script). Since then, Islamic beliefs and concepts began to make its mark on Malay literature. The [[Terengganu Inscription Stone]], which is dated to 1303, is the earliest known narrative Malay writing. The stone is inscribed with an account of history, law, and [[romance (love)|romance]] in Jawi script.<ref name=\"Marshall Cavendish 2007 1218\">{{harvnb|Marshall Cavendish|2007|p=1218}}</ref> At its height, the Malacca Sultanate was not only the center of Islamisation, but also the center of Malay cultural expressions including literature.

The [[coconut milk]] is also important in giving the Malay dishes their rich, creamy character. The other foundation is ''[[belacan]]'' (shrimp paste), which is used as a base for ''sambal'', a rich sauce or condiment made from belacan, [[Chili pepper|chillies]], onions and garlic. Malay cooking also makes plentiful use of [[lemongrass]] and [[galangal]].<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2006|p=58}}</ref>\n\nNearly every Malay meal is served with rice, the [[staple food]] in many other East Asian cultures. Although there are various type of dishes in a Malay meal, all are served at once, not in courses. Food is eaten delicately with the fingers of right hand, never with the left which is used for personal ablutions, and Malays rarely use utensils.<ref>{{harvnb|Marshall Cavendish|2007|p=1222}}</ref> Because most of Malay people are Muslims, Malay cuisine follows Islamic [[halal]] dietary law rigorously. Protein intake are mostly taken from beef, water buffalo, goat, and lamb meat, and also includes poultry and fishes. Pork and any non-halal meats, also alcohol is prohibited and absent from Malay daily diet.\n\n[[Nasi lemak]], rice cooked in rich [[coconut milk]] probably is the most popular dish ubiquitous in Malay town and villages. Nasi lemak is considered as [[Malaysia]]'s [[national dish]].<ref>{{harvnb|Malaysia.com|2011}}</ref> While ''Nasi Minyak'' and ''Nasi Hujan Panas'', rice broiled with ghee and spices is hailed as a ceremonial dish for special occasions, especially during the traditional Malay weddings.\n\nAnother example is [[Ketupat]] or ''nasi himpit'', glutinous compressed rice cooked in palm leaves, is popular especially during ''Idul Fitri'' or ''Hari Raya'' or [[Eid ul-Fitr]]. Various meats and vegetables could be made into [[Gulai]] or [[Curry|Kari]], a type of curry dish with variations of spices mixtures that clearly display Indian influence already adopted by Malay people since ancient times. [[Laksa]], a hybrid of Malay and Peranakan Chinese cuisine is also a popular dish. Malay cuisine also adopted and received visible influence from some of their closest neighbours' cuisine traditions, such as [[rendang]] adopted from the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]]s in [[West Sumatra|Pagaruyung]], and [[satay]] from Java, however Malay people has developed their own distinctive taste and recipes.\n\n===Performing arts===\n[[File:ShowMakyonginRama5.jpg|thumb|A troupe of [[Thai Malays|Siamese Malay]] dancers performing the [[Mak Yong]] during the reign of [[Chulalongkorn|King Rama V of Siam]] (c. 19th century), a dance theatre that owes its origin from the [[Pattani]] and [[Kelantanese]] palace courts. In 2005, it received recognition as being among the [[Intangible cultural heritage|masterpieces of the oral and intangible heritage of humanity]] by [[UNESCO]].]]\nThe Malays have diverse kinds of music and dance which are fusions of different cultural influences. Typical genres range from traditional Malay folk dances dramas like [[Mak Yong]] to the Arab-influenced [[Zapin]] dances. Choreographed movements also vary from simple steps and tunes in [[Dikir barat]] to the complicated moves in [[Joget]] [[Gamelan]].\n\nTraditional Malay music is basically percussive. Various kinds of [[gongs]] provide the beat for many dances. There are also drums of various sizes, ranging from the large ''rebana ubi'' used to punctuate important events to the small ''jingled-rebana'' ([[frame drum]]) used as an accompaniment to vocal recitations in religious ceremonies.<ref>{{harvnb|Moore|1998|p=48}}</ref>\n\n[[Royal Regalia of Malaysia#Nobat|Nobat]] music became part of the [[Royal Regalia]] of Malay courts since the arrival of Islam in the 12th century and only performed in important court ceremonies. Its orchestra includes the sacred and highly revered instruments of ''nehara'' ([[kettledrums]]), ''gendang'' (double-headed drums), ''nafiri'' (trumpet), ''serunai'' ([[oboe]]), and sometimes a knobbed [[gong]] and a pair of [[cymbals]].<ref>{{harvnb|Marshall Cavendish|2007|p=1220}}</ref>\n\nIndian influences are strong in a traditional [[shadow play]] known as [[Wayang Kulit]] where stories from Hindu epics; [[Ramayana]] & [[Mahabharata]] form the main repertoire. There are four distinctive types of shadow puppet theatre that can be found in Malay peninsula; ''Wayang Gedek'', ''Wayang Purwa'', ''Wayang Melayu'' and ''Wayang Siam''.<ref>{{harvnb|Srinivasa|2003|p=296}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Ghulam Sarwar Yousof|1997|p=3}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Matusky|1993|pp=8\u201311}}</ref> Nonetheless, the art and the storytelling of ''Wayang Purwa'' and ''Wayang Siam'' denote a regional influence in fused with the Javanese and Siamese respectively, while ''Wayang Melayu'' and ''Wayang Gedek'' narrated a more autochthonously Malay form and fashion.\n\nOther well-known Malay performing arts are; ''[[Bangsawan]]'' theatre, ''[[Dondang Sayang]]'' love ballad and ''[[Mak Inang]]'' dance from Malacca Sultanate, ''[[Jikey]]'' and ''[[Mek Mulung]]'' theatre from [[Kedah]], ''[[Asyik]]'' dance and ''[[Menora (dance)|Menora]]'' dance drama from [[Pattani (region)|Patani]] and [[Kelantan]], ''[[Ulek mayang]]'' and ''[[Rodat (dance)|Rodat]]'' dance from Terengganu, ''[[Boria (theatre)|Boria]]'' theatre from [[Penang]], ''Canggung'' dance from [[Perlis]], ''Mukun'' narrative songs from [[Brunei]] and [[Sarawak]],<ref>{{harvnb|Marzuki bin Haji Mohd Seruddin|2009}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Mysarawak.org|2009}}</ref><ref name=\"Ahmad Salehuddin 2009\">{{harvnb|Ahmad Salehuddin|2009}}</ref> [[Gending Sriwijaya]] from [[Palembang]],''Serampang Dua Belas'' dance from [[Sultanate of Serdang|Serdang]].<ref name=\"Ahmad Salehuddin 2009\"/> and [[Zapin Api|Zapin Api firedance]] from [[Riau]].\n\n===Traditional dress===\n[[File:HariRayaMalaykids.jpg|thumb|right|Malay children wearing traditional dress during [[Eid al-Fitr]].]]\n{{Main|Baju Melayu|Baju Kurung}}\nThe traditional Malay apparel and textile has been continuously morphed since the time of antiquity. Historically, the ancient Malays were chronicled to incorporate various natural materials as a vital source for fabrics, clothing and attire. The common era however, witnessing the early arrivals the merchants from east and west to the harbours of Malay archipelago, together they bought new luxurious items, including fine cotton and silks. The garments subsequently become a source of high Malay fashion and acquired a cultural role as the binding identity in the archipelago, especially in the Peninsula, Sumatra and the coastal areas of Borneo.<ref name=\"Hanisa Hassan 2016 1\">{{harvnb|Hanisa Hassan|2016|p=1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wacanaseni.usm.my/WACANA%20SENI%20JOURNAL%20OF%20ARTS%20DISCOURSE/wacanaseni_v15/WS_15_3.pdf |title=A Study on the Development of Baju Kurung Design in the Context of Cultural Changes in Modern Malaysia|last=Hanisa Hassan|publisher=Perpustakaan Negara Malaysia|accessdate=22 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn Malay culture, clothes and textiles are revered as symbols of beauty, power and status. Numerous accounts in [[List of Hikayat|Malay hikayats]] stressed the special place occupied by textiles.<ref>{{harvnb|Maznah Mohammad|1996|p=2}}</ref> The Malay handloom industry can be traced its origin since the 13th century when the eastern trade route flourished under [[Song dynasty]]. Mention of locally made textiles as well as the predominance of weaving in [[Malay peninsular]] was made in various Chinese and Arab accounts.<ref>{{harvnb|Maznah Mohammad|1996|p=19}}</ref> Among well-known Malay textiles are [[Songket]], [[Malaysian batik|Batik]], ''Telepok'', ''Limar'', ''Tenun'', ''Kelingkam'', ''Cindai'', ''Pelangi'' and ''Tekad''.\n\nClassical Malay dress varies between different regions, but the most profound traditional dress in modern-day are Baju Kurung (for women) and Baju Melayu (for men), which both recognised as the national dress for Malaysia and Brunei, and also worn by Malay communities in Indonesia, Singapore, Myanmar and Thailand.\n\nThe word ''Baju Kurung'', literary defined as \"encase the body\" of the wearer is tailored based on the Islamic principles of modesty, decency and humility. The practice is parallel to the [[Judaeo-Christian]] religious doctrine, as flaunting the [[Intimate parts in Islam|intimate body parts]] is considered as forbidden in Islam. The interpretation was then absorbed to the Malay way of dressing and cultural perspective, this can be strongly witnessed upon the rule of [[Mansur Shah of Malacca]] in the 15th century, the sultan prohibited his female Muslim subjects in the public from wearing only a sarong from the bust downwards. Throughout the ages, The Malay Baju Kurung went into several reincarnation before assuming its current form. Due to the vastness of various Malay kingdoms in the [[Malay archipelago|archipelago]], local and distinct forms of the Baju Kurung design patterns can also be witnessed in the region, including Bengkulu, Kedah, Jambi, Johor-Riau, Pahang and Palembang.<ref name=\"Hanisa Hassan 2016 1\"/>\n\nThe corresponding mode of Baju Kurung for men is known as \"Baju Melayu\". The upper part of the garment was made with the geometrical design almost similar with Baju Kurung and commonly paired with woven cloth known as the sarong. The pattern of the sarong may possessed a symbol of the person's marital status or the rank in the classical Malay society.<ref name=\"Hanisa Hassan 2016 1\"/>\n\nOther common classical Malay attire for men consists of a ''baju'' (shirt) or ''tekua'' (a type of a long sleeve shirt), ''baju rompi'' (vest), ''kancing'' (button), a small leg ''celana'' (trousers), a [[sarong]] worn around the waist, ''capal'' (sandal), and a ''tanjak'' or ''tengkolok'' ([[headgear]]); for the aristocrats, the ''baju sikap'' or ''baju layang'' (a type of coat) and ''pending'' (ornamental belt buckle) are also synonymous to be worn as a formal attire. It was also common for a ''pendekar'' (Malay warrior) to have a [[Kris]] tucked into the front fold of sarong.\n\nIn contrast to Baju Melayu which continued to be worn as ceremonial dress only, Baju Kurung is worn daily throughout the year by a majority of Malay women. Sighting of female civil servants, professional workers and students wearing Baju Kurung is common in Malaysia and Brunei.\n\n===Festivals and celebrations===\n[[File:Majlis Tujuh Likor Pasang Pelita.jpg|thumb|Rows of Pelita ([[oil lamps]]) lighted during ''Malam Tujuh Likur'' (the 27th night of [[Ramadhan]]), the oil lamps are traditionally used to illuminate homes and the streets during the Ramadhan. Seen here in [[Muar town|Muar]], Johor, Malaysia]]\nThe rise of [[Islam]] managed to [[ethnogenesis|redefine]] the [[Malayness|Malay identity]] by the 15th century. Thus, resulting most of the Malay festivals and celebrations to run parallel with the [[Islamic calendar]], albeit deeply ingrained with a strong sense of [[Malayisation|Malay character]]. The biannual [[Hari Raya]] (lit \"the Great Day\") observance of [[Aildifitri]] and [[Aidiladha]] are hailed as the grand celebrations universally across the Malay community. The two holidays are instrumental to commentate two major events and philosophy in the Islamic teaching and beliefs. The former signifies the triumph as a Muslim after a month of [[Fasting in Islam|fasting]] and patience in [[Ramadan]], while the latter is to observe the sacrifice made by [[Ibrahim]] (Abraham) under the name of [[Allah]].\n\nThe ''Raya'' holidays usually commenced during the [[wikt:homecoming|homecoming]] event known as [[Balik Kampung]] or ''Balik Raya'' which occurred a few days before the festival. During the Hari Raya, the Malays would celebrated by performing the [[Eid prayers]], holding a grand feast and visiting friends, relatives and neighbours. A visit to the grave of the departed loved ones is also essential, as a sign of respect, love and honour.\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Plechtigheden bij de kroning van de Sultan van Deli in 1925 op de troon de sultan en zijn echtgenote met aan weerszijden de rijkssieraden TMnr 10001572.jpg|thumb|The coronation ceremony between Tengku Otteman, as the ''Tengku Mahkota'' (Crown Prince) of [[Sultanate of Deli|Deli Sultanate]] in Residency of Sumatra's East Coast, [[Dutch East Indies]]; with his wife, Raja Amnah, daughter of [[Raja Chulan]] and a member of [[Perak Sultanate|Perak Royalty]] as ''Tengku Puan Indera'' in 1925.]]\nOther major liturgical and religious ceremonies celebrated by the Malays include [[Ramadhan]], a month-long holy month devoted by daytime fasting and various religious activities; [[Maulidur Rasul]], a special grand procession to honour the birth of Prophet [[Muhammad]]; [[Ashura]], remembrance of [[Muharram]] where the Malays would solemnly prepared a special dish, known as ''Bubur Ashura''; [[Nisfu Syaaban]], the Mid-[[Sha'ban]] observance, a special day of [[fasting]] for forgiveness; [[Nuzul Quran]], the first the revelation of the [[Quran]]; [[Israk dan Mikraj]], the ascension Prophet Muhammed to the heavens and [[Awal Muharram]], the Islamic New Year; the latter three celebrations are usually observed by holding a special ''sunat'' prayers, religious lectures and Islamic discussions in the [[mosque]].\n\nThere are also a plethora of domestic regional cultural festivals and social events within different the Malay spheres. The coastal areas were historically known to observed the ''Mandi Safar'' or ''Puja Pantai'' ceremony, a purifying bath during the [[Islamic calendar|Islamic month]] of [[Safar]], originally emulated from the ancient pre-Islamic Malay holy cleansing rituals; and ''Pesta Menuai'', a [[harvest festival]] celebrated by the inland and agrarian Malay communities by traditional games, theatre, [[Joget]] and other repertoire of dance-play. However, both of the practice is gradually extinct owing from various social and economic revolution engineered in the Malay community in the 20th century. Additionally, many Malays are also known to participate in the imperial celebrations to honour the royal courts of their respective kingdoms.\n\nThe Islamic features also strongly embroidered the Malay celebrations in the individual level, a juxtaposition bonded to the spiritual [[rite of passage]] as a Muslim. The Malays would usually organised ''kenduri'', a religious ceremonial banquet to celebrate or to seek blessing for an event. There are several philosophical variations of kenduri, raging from ''Doa Selamat'' (asking for divine favour and protection), ''Kesyukuran'' (for thanksgiving and gratitude), ''Melenggang Perut'' (ceremonial massage for a mother who is pregnant with her first child), ''Aqiqah'' and ''Cukur Jambul'' (newborn ceremony, for celebrating a new life), ''Bertindik'' (the first piercing ceremony for a female child), ''Khatam'' (a graduation ceremony, after a child's first full-reading of the [[Quran]]), ''Khatan'' ([[circumcision]]),  ''Kahwin'' ([[wedding]]), ''Arwah'' or ''Tahlil'' (prayers for a deceased person),  among few. The event is usually organised by the family and was traditionally aided by the community in a social gathering known as ''Rewang'' or ''Gotong-royong''. During this ceremony, the whole family would be assisted by their neighbours and relatives, delegating various tasks raging from food preparations, venue management, logistic assembly and other technical control. Nevertheless, following the rise of [[urbanism]] in the contemporary Malay community, the practice of ''Rewang/Gotong-Royong'' is gradually superseded by hired-[[catering|caterer]] services by the family.\n\n===Martial arts===\n[[File:Silat Melayu Keris Lok 9.jpg|thumb|A [[Silat Melayu]] performance on a stage.]]\n{{Main|Silat|Silat Melayu}}\nSilat and its variants can be found throughout the Malay world: the [[Malay peninsula]] (including [[Singapore]]), the [[Riau Islands]], [[Sumatra]] and coastal areas of [[Borneo]]. Archaeological evidence reveals that, by the 6th century, formalised combat arts were being practised in the Malay peninsular and Sumatra.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1994|p=73}}</ref> The earliest forms of Silat are believed to have been developed and used in the armed forces of the ancient Malay kingdoms of [[Langkasuka]] (2nd century)<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2006|p=225}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Abd. Rahman Ismail|2008|p=188}}</ref> and Srivijaya (7th century).\n\nThe influence of the Malay sultanates of Malacca, [[Johor Sultanate|Johor]], [[Pattani Kingdom|Pattani]] and [[Brunei Sultanate|Brunei]] has contributed to the spread of this martial art in the Malay Archipelago. Through a complex maze of sea channels and river capillaries that facilitated exchange and trade throughout the region, Silat wound its way into the dense rainforest and up into the mountains. The legendary [[Laksamana]] [[Hang Tuah]] of Malacca is one of the most renowned ''pesilat'' (Silat practitioners) in history<ref>{{harvnb|Green|2001|p=802}}</ref> and even considered by some as the father of Malay silat.<ref>{{harvnb|Sheikh Shamsuddin|2005|p=195}}</ref> Since the classical era, [[Silat Melayu]] underwent great diversification and formed what is today traditionally recognised as the source of Indonesian [[Pencak Silat]] and other forms of Silat in Southeast Asia.<ref>{{harvnb|Draeger|1992|p=23}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Farrer|2009|p=28}}</ref>\n\nApart from Silat, [[Tomoi]] is also practised by Malays, mainly in the northern region of the Malay peninsula. It is a variant of [[Indochina|Indo-Chinese]] forms of [[kickboxing]] which is believed to have been spread in the Southeast Asian mainland since the time of [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan Empire]] (68&nbsp;AD).\n\n===Metal casting===\n[[File:Bunga Mas (Muzium Negara).jpg|thumb|The [[Bunga Mas]], [[National Museum of Malaysia]]. Literary translated as the \"Golden Flowers\", the Bunga Mas was offered by the northern Malay states of [[Terengganu]], [[Kelantan]], [[Kedah]], [[Patani Kingdom|Pattani]], [[Nong Chik District|Nong Chik]], [[Yala Province|Yala]], [[Ra-ngae District|Rangae]], [[Kubang Pasu Darul Qiyam|Kubang Pasu]] and [[Kingdom of Setul Mambang Segara|Setul]] to the King of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] ([[Siam]]) as a symbol of allegiance.]]\nIn the Malay society, classical [[metalworks]] assumed a role more than a mere instrumental tool. It serves as a testament of [[culture]], cultivated by [[art]]istic appreciation and [[religious]] symbol, molded by a craftsman who possessed a talent to redefined the essence of nature in the most ornamental manner. The artform has indeed received a long existence in the [[Malay World]], observations made by the [[Arab people|Arabs]] on the courts of [[Srivijaya]] narrated that about the abundance of golds in the [[Palembang|capital]], till the extend that the bars have to be ceremonially thrown into the [[estuary]] in a daily basis. On the Chinese accounts, the area was occasionally hailed as ''Jinzou'', the [[gold]] coast. The zenith of Srivijaya also witnessed the arrivals of [[silver]] bought by the foreign merchants, which then spread to the members of Malay aristocracy.<ref name=\"Shaffer 1955\">{{harvnb|Shaffer|1955}}</ref>\n\nUpon the turn of the 17th century, gold, silver, [[iron]] and [[brass]] have all been perfectly molded to become part and parcel to the Malay society. The era witnessed the works of metal received a critical royal patronage. A multitude of Malay metalworks manifested as evidence of this era, raging from a peculiar Malay dagger known as [[Keris]] made of iron, down to the elaborate fine [[jewellery]] made from the splendor of gold and silver. For the Malay nobles during this period, the works of pending (ornamental [[Belt buckle]] embellished with [[precious stones]]), ''keronsang'' (brooch) and ''cucuk sanggul'' (hairpins) were staged to become among the most sought item of fashion. The era also hosted a number of other prominent items in the Malay regalia cast in gold, including ceremonial box, ''Tepak sirih'' (Betel container) and parts of Keris. The art of casting gold were predominantly done by [[repouss\u00e9]] and [[Granulation (process)|granulation]] techniques, in which the traditional methods can still be witnessed until today. In the contemporary era, the Malay gold jewels are mainly found in the form of anklets, bracelets, rings, necklaces, pendants and earrings.<ref name=\"Malaysia Handicrafts ~ Gold Silver & Brass 2011\">{{harvnb|Malaysia Handicrafts ~ Gold Silver & Brass|2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Karyaneka 2013\">{{harvnb|Karyaneka|2013}}</ref>\n\nFor the Malay silverware, the works of silver are fairly known for its sophisticated and fine designs. It is usually crafted in the form of repousse, [[filigree]] and [[Niello|neillowork]]. Among the common traditional Malay items usually made of silver includes pillow ends, belt buckles, matt corners, stoppers for water vessels, Keris sheaths and tobacco boxes. The ''Awan Larat'' (cloud patterns) and ''Kerawang'' (Vegetal motives) are among the popular designs for Malay decorative silver pillow ends and tobacco boxes.<ref name=\"Malaysia Handicrafts ~ Gold Silver & Brass 2011\"/>\n\nThe usage of brassware transcends a plethora of classical Malay social classes, being used by the members of nobility and commoners alike. The popularity of brassware is heavily contributed due to its durability, quality and affordability to all. The brassware can be narrowed into two distinctions, yellow brass for functional items and white for [[Ornamental brassware|decorative purposes]]. It is often meticulously hammered and craved with various decorative designs in [[Islamic arts|religious]] and floral motives. The usage of brass however, is best known for [[Tepak Sireh]], a ceremonial tray for betel quid and for constructing certain musical instruments such as [[Gong]]s for the classical Malay [[Gamelan]] orchestra. Additionally, other prominent traditional Malay items made from metal includes flower vases, perfume sprinkles, serving trays, cooking pots, kettle and incense burners.<ref name=\"Malaysia Handicrafts ~ Gold Silver & Brass 2011\"/><ref name=\"Karyaneka 2013\"/>\n\n===Weaponry===\n[[File:Malay Keris.jpg|thumb|A Malay Keris, with its sheath on the left. This particular dagger was historically belonged to a Malay aristocrat from [[Sumatra]].]]\n{{See also|Taming Sari}}\nThe [[Keris]] is one of the most revered items of Malay weaponry. Originally developed by the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] down south, the armament gradually assumed a Malay identity after entering the [[Srivijaya]]n court, giving rise to characteristics distinct from its Javanese Keris forebears.<ref name=\"William Wira Kusuma 2011\">{{harvnb| William Wira Kusuma|2011}}</ref> By the time of [[Sultanate of Malacca|Malacca]] in the 15th century, the evolution of the Malay Keris was perfected and possession of a Keris came to be regarded as part-and-parcel of Malay culture, becoming a philosophical symbol, juxtapositioned in prestige, craftsmanship, masculinity and honour.<ref name=\"Syefiri Moniz Mohd.

The absence of a Keris on a man was frowned upon, perceived as if he were parading naked to the public. Traditionally, a man of Malay extraction would own three types of Keris: ''Keris Pusaka'' (the Dynasty Keris, inherited from one generation to another), ''Keris Pangkat'' (the Status Keris, awarded in right of his position in Malay society) and ''Keris Perjuangan Dirinya'' (the Struggle Keris, literally defined as his personal Keris). There are many strict rules, regulations and taboos to be adhered to in owning a Keris.<ref name=\"Angahsunan 2017\"/> The blade of a Kris is usually coated in a venomous arsenic, thus crafting an excruciatingly lethal blade for its prey.<ref name=\"Faizal Izzani Zakaria 2016\"/> Traditionally, each Keris is also regarded as possessing a [[spirit]], known as ''semangat''. Special rituals were to be conducted to nurture, preserve and guard the \"soul\" of the weapon.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.thepatriots.asia/archives/4275 |title=Archived copy |access-date=20 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923024340/https://www.thepatriots.asia/archives/4275 |archive-date=23 September 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The spiritual approach is usually held every ''Malam Jumaat'' (Thursday night), with the blade is being purified with [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] and smoked with [[incense]], dedicated prayers and devoted mantras would be also recited upon to complement the mystic ritual.<ref name=\"Irma Musliana 2016\">{{harvnb|Irma Musliana|2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Istinggar Melayu.jpg|thumb|The [[Trigger (firearms)|trigger mechanism]] of an ''[[Istinggar]]'', a classical Malay gun as displayed in ''Muzium Warisan Melayu'' (Malay Heritage Museum), [[Seri Kembangan|Serdang]], [[Selangor]].

Before the [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|fall of Malacca]] (1511), already existed malay firearm called ''bedil'', or [[Java arquebus]].]]\nThe Malays and Javanese are abided by contrasting philosophical [[values]] pertaining to Keris-wearing. Traditionally, a Malay would embedded his Keris from the front, an honour that the weapon is more paramount compared to the wearer and a constant reminder that one is always equipped to combat the nemesis. The Javanese however, adhered to the principle that he should be more cautious and the Keris may solely be exercised during the time of need, thus cladding their Keris from behind. The Javanese also believed that by mobilising their weapon that position, it would confused the enemy.<ref name=\"Angahsunan 2017\"/>\n\nParadoxically, both groups shared a similar ideology addressing the [[Kris#Hilt|hilt]] of the Keris. If the hilt faced up front, it serves as a testament that the man is prepared for a fight. Nevertheless, if the hilt is turned behind, it is an oath that the person is embracing for a [[Conflict resolution|reconciliation]].<ref name=\"Angahsunan 2017\"/>\n\nThere are also a plethora of other forms of weaponry in the Malay arsenal, all were nevertheless equally revered in a correlating manner as the Keris. The Malays would classified the traditional weapons under 7 different structures: ''Tuju'' (\"Direct\", the large and heavy artillery, including the Malay [[cannons]] of ''Meriam'', ''Ekor Lontong'', ''Lela'' and ''Rentaka''), ''Bidik'' (\"[[Gun]]\", a weapon with metal tube propelled by an [[ammunition]], with the Malay forms of ''Terakor'' and ''Istingar''), ''Setubuh'' (\"A body\", weapon in the similar dimension of a [[human body]], referred to the Malay [[spears]] of ''Tongkat Panjang'' and ''Lembing''), ''Selengan'' (\"An arm\", a large [[saber]] from the length of the shoulders to the tips of the fingers, constituting the Malay saber of ''Pedang'' and ''Sundang''), ''Setangan'' (\"A hand\", a sword with the diameter measured from the elbow to the 3 fingers, including ''Badik Panjang'' and ''Tekpi''), ''Sepegang'' (\"A hold\", smaller than the ''Setangan'', a [[dagger]] with ''Keris'' and ''Badik'' in the category) and ''Segenggam'' (\"A grab\", the smallest in the category, the hand-sized [[blade]], including ''Lawi Ayam'', ''Kerambit'', ''Kuku Macan'' and ''Kapak Binjai'').<ref name=\"Kerawang Merah 2017\">{{harvnb|Kerawang Merah|2017}}</ref> Other items in the traditional Malay weaponry includes ''sumpit'' ([[Blowgun|Blowpipe]]) and ''Busur dan Panah'' ([[Bow and Arrow]]), which are distinct from the seven class of armaments. Additionally, the Malays also would deploy ''Zirah'', a type of ''Baju Besi'' ([[armour]]) and ''Perisai'' ([[shield]]) as defense mechanisms during the [[armed conflict]].\n\n===Traditional games===\n[[File:Finished wau and wau frame.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Wau bulan|Wau]]-maker's workshop in [[Kelantan]], Malaysia. This peculiar type of kite can be found in the northeast coast of Malay Peninsular.]]\nTraditional Malay games usually require craft skills and manual dexterity and can be traced their origins since the days of Malacca Sultanate. ''[[Sepak Raga]]'' and [[kite flying]] are among traditional games that were mentioned in the [[Malay Annals]] being played by nobilities and royalties of the Malay sultanate.<ref>{{harvnb|Leyden|1821|p=261}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Lockard|2009|p=48}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Ooi|2004|p=1357}}</ref>\n\n''[[Sepak Raga]]'' is one of the most popular Malay games and has been played for centuries. Traditionally, Sepak raga was played in circle by kicking and keeps aloft the rattan ball using any part of the body except the arms and hands. It is now recognised as [[Malaysia]]'s national sport<ref>{{harvnb|Ziegler|1972|p=41}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|McNair|2002|p=104}}</ref> and played in the international sporting events such as [[Asian Games]] and [[Southeast Asian Games]].\n\n[[File:Gasing.jpg|thumb|A close-up to two Malay style ''[[Top|Gasings]]''.]]\nOther popular game is [[top|''Gasing'' spinning]] which usually played after the [[harvest]] season. A great skill of [[Artisan|craftsmanship]] is required to produce the most competitive ''Gasing'' (top), some of which spin for two hours at a time.<ref name=\"Alexander 2006 51\">{{harvnb|Alexander|2006|p=51}}</ref>\n\nPossibly the most popular Malay games is the ''[[Wau bulan|Wau]]'' (a unique kind of kite from east coast of Malay peninsular) or kite flying. Wau-flying competitions take place with judges awarding points for craftsmanship (''Wau'' are beautiful, colourful objects set on bamboo frames), sound (all [[Malay kite]]s are designed to create a specific sound as they are buffeted about in the wind) and altitude.<ref name=\"Alexander 2006 51\"/>\n\nThe Malays also have a variant of [[Mancala]] board game known as [[Congkak]]. The game is played by moving stones, marbles, beads or shells around a wooden board consisting of twelve or more holes. Mancala is acknowledged as the oldest game in the world and can be traced its origin since [[Ancient Egypt]].\nAs the game dispersed around the globe, every culture has invented its own variation including the Malays.<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2006|p=52}}</ref>\n\n===Names and titles===\n{{Main|Malay names|Malay styles and titles}}\nMalay personal names are complex, reflecting the hierarchical nature of the society, and titles are considered important. It has undergone tremendous change, evolving with the times to reflect the different influences that the Malays been subjected over the ages. Although some Malay names still retain parts of its indigenous [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] influences, as Muslims, Malays have long favoured [[Arabic names]] as marks of their religion.\n\nMalay names are [[patronymic]] and can be consisted of up to four parts; a title, a given name, the family name, and a description of the individual's male parentage. Some given names and father's names can be composed of double names and even triple names, therefore generating a longer name. For example, one of the Malaysian national footballer has the full name [[Mohd Zaquan Adha Abdul Radzak]], where 'Mohd Zaquan Adha' is his triple given name and 'Abdul Radzak' is his father's double given name.\n\nIn addition to naming system, the [[Malay language]] also has an elaborate system of [[titles]] and [[honorifics]], which are still extensively used in [[Malaysia]] and [[Brunei]]. By applying these [[Malay titles]] to a normal Malay name, a more complex name is produced. The former [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]] has the full name [[Najib Tun Razak|Dato' Seri Mohd Najib bin Tun Haji Abdul Razak]], where 'Dato' Seri' is a Malay title of honour, 'Mohd Najib' is his personal name, 'bin' is derived from an Arabic word Ibnu meaning \"son of\" if in case of daughter it is replaced with binti, an Arabic word \"bintun\" meaning \"daughter of\", introduces his father's titles and names, 'Tun' is a higher honour, 'Haji' denotes his father's [[Hajj]] pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], and 'Abdul Razak' is his father's personal name.\nThe more extremely complex Malay names however, belong to the Malay royalties. The reigning [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] of [[Malaysia]] has the full regnal name [[Abdullah of Pahang|Kebawah Duli Yang Maha Mulia Seri Paduka Baginda Yang di-Pertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri'ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah ibni Almarhum Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah Al-Musta'in Billah]], while the reigning [[Sultan of Brunei]] officially known as [[Hassanal Bolkiah|Kebawah Duli Yang Maha Mulia Paduka Seri Baginda Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'izzaddin Waddaulah ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Haji Omar 'Ali Saifuddien Sa'adul Khairi Waddien]].\n\n==Sub-ethnic groups==\n[[File:Indonesia Ethnic Groups Map English.svg|thumb|center|upright=3.2|Ethnic Malays among other ethnic groups in Indonesia. Although only constituting 3.4% of the total population, ethnic Malays are one of the most widely distributed ethnicities in Indonesia. The realm of Malays is described in green and other related sub-ethnic groups are rendered in darker or lighter green. Malay ethnic groups are shown as inhabiting the eastern coast of Sumatra and coastal Kalimantan. Outside the Indonesian archipelago in white, the Malay people inhabit the Malay peninsula, forming the dominant ethnic group in Peninsular Malaysia and a significant minority in Singapore, Thailand and southern Myanmar.

These locations are today part of the nations of [[Malaysia]] (Malay [[nation state]]), [[Brunei]], [[Singapore]], [[Indonesia]] and Southern [[Thailand]].\n\nThere is considerable genetic, linguistic, cultural, artistic, and social diversity among the many Malay subgroups, mainly due to hundreds of years of immigration and assimilation of various regional ethnicity and tribes within [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. Historically, the Malay population is descended primarily from the earlier [[Malayic languages|Malayic]]-speaking Austronesians and [[Austroasiatic]] tribes who founded several ancient maritime trading states and kingdoms, notably [[History of Brunei|Brunei]], [[Kedah Kingdom|Kedah]], [[Langkasuka]], [[Gangga Negara]], [[Chi Tu]], [[Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom|Nakhon Si Thammarat]], [[Old Pahang Kingdom|Pahang]], [[Melayu Kingdom|Melayu]] and [[Srivijaya]].<ref>{{harvnb|Milner|2010|pp=24, 33}}</ref><ref name=\"Barnard 2004 7\">{{harvnb|Barnard|2004|p=7&60}}</ref>\n\nThe advent of the [[Malacca Sultanate]] in the 15th century triggered a major revolution in Malay history, the significance of which lies in its far-reaching political and cultural legacy. Common definitive markers of a [[Malayness]] \u2013 the religion of [[Islam]], the [[Malay language]] and traditions \u2013 are thought to have been promulgated during this era, resulting in the [[ethnogenesis]] of the Malay as a major  [[ethnoreligious group]] in the region.{{sfn|Melayu Online|2005}} In literature, architecture, [[Malay cuisine|culinary traditions]], traditional dress, performing arts, martial arts, and royal court traditions, Malacca set a standard that later Malay sultanates emulated. The golden age of the [[Malay sultanate]]s in the [[Malay Peninsula]], [[Sumatra]] and [[Borneo]] saw many of their inhabitants, particularly from various tribal communities like the [[Batak]], [[Dayak people|Dayak]], [[Orang Asli]] and the [[Orang Laut]] become subject to [[Islamisation]] and [[Malayisation]].{{sfn|Milner|2010|pp=200, 232}}  Today, some Malays have recent forebears from other parts of Maritime Southeast Asia, termed as ''anak dagang'' (\"traders\") and who predominantly consist of [[Banjar people|Banjar]], [[Bugis]],  [[Minangkabau people]] and [[Acehnese people]]s, while some are also descended from more recent immigrants from other countries.{{sfn|Milner|2010|p=10 & 185}}\n\nThroughout their history, the Malays have been known as a coastal-trading community with fluid cultural characteristics.<ref>{{harvnb|Milner|2010|p=131}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Barnard|2004|pp=7, 32, 33 & 43}}</ref> They [[Trans-cultural diffusion|absorbed]], [[Intercultural communication principles|shared]] and [[Cultural learning|transmitted]] numerous cultural features of other local ethnic groups, such as those of Minang, Acehnese, and to some degree [[Javanese culture]]; however Malay culture differs by being more overtly Islamic than the multi-religious Javanese culture.

These ancient people also split with some heading to [[Sulawesi]] and others progressing into [[Java]], and [[Sumatra]], all of which now speak languages that belong to the Austronesian Language family. The final migration was to the Malay Peninsula roughly 3,000 years ago. A sub-group from Borneo moved to Champa in modern-day Central and South Vietnam roughly 4,500 years ago.

Founded in 535 BC, it is among the oldest testament of [[civilisation]] in [[Southeast Asia]] and a potential progenitor of the [[Kedah Tua]] kingdom.\n\nIt was home to a society with its own culture, philosophy, religion and trade. The historical landscape of the area was bound to a flourishing iron industry, with archaeological findings unearthed various historical mines, warehouses, factories, a harbour; together with a vibrant plethora of superior-quality [[ores]], [[furnace]], [[slag]] and [[ingot]]s. Additionally, the peculiar [[Tuyere]] iron-[[smelting]] technique mobilised in Sungai Batu is hailed as oldest of its kind in the world. The produce was highly sought after and exported to various corners of the [[Old World]], including ancient [[India]], [[China]], [[Middle East]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]]. Based on early [[Sanskrit]] reports, the area was known as \"the iron bowl\".<ref name=\"Pearson 2015\"/><ref name=\"Hall 2017\"/>\n\nThe settlement also narrated a glimpse of the ancient religious undertakings prior to the mass [[Greater India#Indianised kingdoms|Indianisation]] of the region. The early inhabitants of the [[Malay Archipelago]] was chronicled to be the adherence of indigenous [[animism]] and [[shamanism]]. The ancient folk religion vividly characterised that every elements of nature possessed a spirit, known as ''semangat''. The ''semangat'' has the governing power to richly blessed or mercilessly cursed the society, hence the spirit should always be pleased and entertained. In Sungai Batu, archaeological evidence unmasked several ceremonial and religious architectures devoted for the sun and mountain worshiping.<ref name=\"Pearson 2015\"/><ref name=\"Hall 2017\"/>\n\nIn addition to Sungai Batu, the early Malay archipelago also witnessed the monumental development of other subsequent ancient large urban settlements and regional polities, driven by a predominantly cosmopolitan agrarian society, thriving skilled craftsmanship, multinational merchants and foreign expatriates. Chinese records noted the names of Akola, [[Pan Pan (kingdom)|P\u2019an P\u2019an]], Tun-Sun, [[History of Kedah|Chieh-ch'a]], [[Chi Tu|Ch'ih-tu]], among few. Upon the fifth century AD, these settlements had morphed into a [[sovereignty|sovereign]] [[city-states]], collectively fashioned by an active participation in the international trade network and hosting diplomatic embassies from China and India.<ref name=\"Pearson 2015\"/><ref name=\"Hall 2017\"/>\n\n===Indian influence===\n{{Further|Greater India}}\n[[File:Malay Kingdoms en.svg|thumb|Early Malayic and pre-Malayic-speaking areas, classical kingdoms and urban settlements preceding the rise of Srivijaya in the 7th century and prior to the eastward [[Malayisation|Malay cultural expansion]] to the shores of Borneo.

The discovery of jetty remains, iron smelting sites, and a clay brick monument dating back to 110&nbsp;CE in the [[Bujang Valley]], shows that a maritime trading route with South Indian [[Tamil Nadu|Tamil kingdoms]] was already established since the second century.<ref>{{harvnb|Devan|2010}}</ref>\n\nThe growth of trade with India brought coastal people in much of maritime Southeast Asia into contact with the major religions of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. Throughout this area a most profound in influence has been exerted by India which seems to have introduced into it architecture, sculpture, writing, monarchy, religion, iron, cotton and a host of elements of higher culture. Indian religions, cultural traditions and [[Sanskrit]] began to spread across the land. [[Hindu temple]]s were built in the Indian style, local kings began referring to themselves as \"[[raja]]\" and more desirable aspects of Indian government were adopted.<ref name=\"zaki1\">{{harvnb|Zaki Ragman|2003|pp=1\u20136}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nakhon Si Thammarat Chedi Phra Baromathat.jpg|thumb|left|''Chedi Phra Borommathat'', a [[stupa]] located in [[Nakhon Si Thammarat]], [[Thailand]].

Between the 7th and 13th centuries, many of these small, often prosperous peninsula and Sumatran maritime trading states, became part of the [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|mandala]] of Srivijaya,<ref>{{harvnb|Sabrizain|2006}}</ref> a great confederation of city-states centred in [[Palembang]],<ref>{{harvnb|Munoz|2006|p=171}}</ref> [[Kedah|Kadaram]],<ref>{{harvnb|Muljana|2006}}</ref> [[Chaiya District|Chaiya]] and [[Tambralinga]].\n\nSrivijaya's influence spread over all the coastal areas of Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula, western [[Java]] and western [[Borneo]], as well as the rest of the [[Malay Archipelago]]. Enjoying both Indian and Chinese patronage, its wealth was gained mostly through trade. At its height, the [[Old Malay language]] was used as its official language and became the [[lingua franca]] of the region, replacing Sanskrit, the language of Hinduism.<ref name=\"zaki1\" /> The Srivijayan era is considered the golden age of Malay culture.\n\nThe glory of Srivijaya however began to wane after the series of raids by the Indian [[Chola dynasty]] in the 11th century. By the end of the 13th century, the remnants of the Malay empire in [[Sumatra]] was finally destroyed by the [[Javanese people|Javanese invaders]] during the [[Pamalayu expedition]] (''Pamalayu'' means \"war against the Malays\").\n\nThe complete destruction of Srivijaya caused the diaspora of the Srivijayan princes and nobles. Rebellions against the Javanese rule ensued and attempts were made by the fleeing Malay princes to revive the empire, which left the area of southern Sumatra in chaos and desolation. In 1299, through the support of the loyal servants of the empire, the [[Orang laut]]s, a Malay prince of Srivijaya origin, [[Sang Nila Utama]] established the [[Kingdom of Singapura]] in [[Temasek]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ministry of Culture|1973|p=9}}</ref> His dynasty ruled the island kingdom until the end of the 14th century, when the Malay polity once again faced the wrath of Javanese invaders.

Between the 13th to early 14th century, the kingdom succeeded to incorporate most of the Malay Peninsula under its mandala. The campaign led by [[Chandrabhanu Sridhamaraja]] (1230\u20131263) managed to capture [[Jaffna kingdom]] in [[Sri Lanka]] between 1247 and 1258. He was eventually defeated by the forces of the [[Pandyan dynasty]] from Tamil Nadu in 1263 and was killed by the brother of Emperor [[Sadayavarman Sundara Pandyan I]].<ref>India's interaction with Southeast Asia, by Govind Chandra Pande p.286</ref> The invasion marked an unrivaled feature in the [[history of Southeast Asia]], it was the only time there was an armed maritime expedition beyond the borders of the region.\n\nThe cultivation of Malay polity system also diffused beyond the proper Sumatran-Peninsular border during this era. The age avowed by exploration and migration of the Malays to establish kingdoms beyond the traditional Srivijayan realm. Several exemplification are the enthronement of a Tambralingan prince to reign the [[Lavo Kingdom]] in present-day [[Central Thailand]], the foundation of [[Rajahnate of Cebu]] in the [[Visayas]] and the establishment of the [[Tanjungpura Kingdom]] in what is now [[West Kalimantan]], [[Borneo]].

By the middle of the 15th century, Brunei entered into a close relationship with the Malacca Sultanate. The sultan married a Malaccan princess, adopted Islam as the court religion, and introduced an efficient administration modelled on Malacca.<ref>{{harvnb|Europa Publications Staff|2002|p=203}}</ref> Brunei profited from trade with Malacca but gained even greater prosperity after the great Malay port was conquered by the Portuguese in 1511.

Brunei also expanded its influence in Mindanao, [[Philippines]] when Sultan Bolkiah married Leila Macanai, the daughter of the [[Sultanate of Sulu|Sultan of Sulu]]. However, states like the [[Huangdom of Pangasinan]], [[Rajahnate of Cebu]] and [[Kedatuan of Madja-as]] tried to resist Brunei's and Islam's spread into the Philippines. Brunei's fairly loose river based governmental presence in Borneo projected the process of [[Malayisation]]. Fine Malay Muslim cultures, including the language, dress and single-family dwelling were introduced to the natives primarily from ethnic [[Dayak people|Dayaks]], drawing them into the Sultanate. Dayak chiefs were incorporated into the Malay hierarchy, being given the official titles of ''[[Datuk]]'', ''[[Temenggong]]'' and ''Orang Kaya''. In [[West Kalimantan|West Borneo]], the development of such sultanates of [[Sarawak Sultanate|Sarawak]], [[Sultanate of Sambas|Sambas]], [[Sukadana]] and [[Landak Regency|Landak]] tells a similar tale of recruitment among Dayak people.<ref>{{harvnb|Milner|2010|pp=82\u201384}}</ref>\n\nOther significant Malay sultanates were the [[Kedah Sultanate]] (1136\u2013present), [[Kelantan|Kelantan Sultanate]] (1411\u2013present), [[Pattani Kingdom|Patani Sultanate]] (1516\u20131771), [[Reman Sultanate]] (1785\u20131909) and [[Legeh Sultanate]] (1755\u20131902) that dominated the northern part of the Malay peninsula.

The sultanate would be abolished almost half a century later in 1911 by the Dutch powers, following a strong independence movement manifested in the nation against the [[Dutch East Indies|colonial government]].]]\n\nBetween 1511 and 1984, numerous Malay kingdoms and sultanates fell under direct [[colonisation]] or became the [[protectorate]]s of different foreign powers, from European colonial powers like [[Portugal|Portuguese]], [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[United Kingdom|British]], to regional powers like [[Siam]] and [[Japan]].\nIn 1511, the [[Portuguese Empire]] [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|captured]] the capital city of the [[Malacca Sultanate]]. The victorious Portuguese however, were unable to extend their political influence beyond the [[A Famosa|fort of Malacca]]. The Sultan maintained his overlordship on the lands outside Malacca and established the [[Johor Sultanate]] in 1528 to succeed Malacca. [[Portuguese Malacca]] faced several unsuccessful retaliation attacks by Johor until 1614, when the combined forces of Johor and the [[Dutch Empire]], [[Battle of Malacca (1641)|ousted]] the Portuguese from the peninsula. As per agreement with Johor in 1606, the Dutch later took control of Malacca.<ref>{{harvnb|Hunter|Roberts|2010|p=345}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, [[Malay states]] of the peninsular had a hostile relation with the [[Thai people|Siamese]]. Malacca sultanate herself fought two wars with the Siamese while northern Malay states came intermittently under Siamese dominance for centuries. In 1771, the [[Thonburi Kingdom|Kingdom of Siam]] under the new [[Chakri Dynasty]] abolished the [[Pattani Kingdom|Pattani Sultanate]] and later annexed a large part of [[Kedah Sultanate]]. Earlier, the Siamese under [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] have had already absorbed [[Tambralinga]] and overrun the [[Singgora Sultanate]] in the 17th century. Between 1808\u20131813, the Siamese imposed a new administrative structure and created the [[Satellite state|semi-independent]] Malay kingdoms of [[Pattani Kingdom|Patani]], [[Sai Buri District|Saiburi]], [[Nong Chik District|Nongchik]], [[Yaring District|Yaring]], [[Yala Province|Yala]], [[Reman]] and [[Rangae]] from [[Patani (region)|Greater Pattani]] and similarly obtained [[Ranong province|Rundung]], [[Takua Pa District|Kupa]], [[Phuket province|Tongkah]], [[Trang Province|Terang]] while carving [[Setul Kingdom|Setul]], Langu, [[Perlis]], [[Kubang Pasu Kingdom|Kubang Pasu]] from the [[Kedah Kingdom]] in 1839.<ref>{{harvnb|Andaya|Andaya|1984|pp=62\u201368}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Ganguly|1997|p=204}}</ref> In 1902, the Siamese stripped the political powers of all the 7 kingdoms of Pattani following a planned revolt for independence against the central government.

In 1819, the company also acquired [[Singapore]] from [[Johor Empire]], later in 1824, [[Dutch Malacca]] from the Dutch, and followed by [[Straits Settlements#Dindings and Province Wellesley|Dindings]] from [[Perak]] by 1874. All these trading posts officially known as [[Straits Settlements]] in 1826 and became the crown colony of [[British Empire]] in 1867. British intervention in the affairs of Malay states was formalised in 1895, when [[Malay rulers]] accepted [[British Resident]]s in administration, and the [[Federated Malay States]] was formed. In 1909, [[Kedah]], [[Kelantan]], [[Terengganu]] and [[Perlis]] were [[Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909|handed over]] by Siam to the British. These states along with [[Johor]], later became known as [[Unfederated Malay States]]. During the [[World War II]], all these British possessions and protectorates that collectively known as [[British Malaya]] were occupied by the [[Empire of Japan]].\n\nThe twilight of the vast Bruneian Empire began during the [[Castille War]] against the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] conquistadors which arrived at the Philippines from Mexico. The war resulted in the end of the empire's dominance in the present-day [[Philippine archipelago]]. The decline further culminated in the 19th century, when the Sultanate lost most of its remaining territories in [[Borneo]] to the [[White Rajah]]s of [[Sarawak]], [[North Borneo Chartered Company]] and its [[Kalimantan|lower Borneo]] vassals to [[Dutch East India Company]].

The British originally planned for the inclusion of [[Kingdom of Reman|Reman]], Legeh and [[Kingdom of Setul|Setul]] under their dominion together with a cluster of northern Malay states. Nonetheless, they only managed to secure [[Kedah]], [[Kelantan]], [[Terengganu]] and [[Perlis]] under the agreement. The treaty also witnessed the state of Kedah being reduced the most, with [[Tarutao National Park|Tarutao]], [[Tarutao National Park|Butang islands]] groups, [[Sadao District|Sendawa]], [[La-ngu District|Langgu]] and the principality of [[Setul Kingdom|Setul]] were all being divorced into the Siamese hands, a similar fate was also followed in northeastern coast of Kelantan that was demanded to renounced their right on the [[Tak Bai District|Tabal district]], including [[Su-ngai Kolok District|Sungai Golok]] and [[Su-ngai Padi District|Sungai Padi]]; while [[Perlis]] lost its Pujoh district. Then-British controlled [[Federated Malay States|Federated Malay State]] of [[Perak]] however, saw an enlargement of their land area, with [[Hulu Perak|southern territories]] of [[Reman]] being transferred into the state and additionally Kelantan received [[Jeli District|Jeli]] from Legeh (which had been under Siamese jurisdiction since 1902). The Siamese then [[abdicated]] Tunku Baharuddin, the [[Kingdom of Setul Mambang Segara|King of Setul]], the sole Malay kingdom remained under Siamese territory in 1916. The treaty nonetheless, manage to sealed the fate of the Malay states of [[Kedah]], [[Kelantan]], [[Terengganu]] and [[Perlis]] to retain a degree of their sovereign powers under the [[British Malaya|British colonial government]], a legacy that can be witnessed today in the Malaysian administrative system.\n\nLater during the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies]], [[Japanese occupation of Malaya|British Malaya]] and [[Japanese occupation of British Borneo|Borneo]], the Japanese maintained a favourable relationship with the Sultans and other Malay leaders, this is partially composed to foster the trust of the Malay public that was generally loyal towards the sultan. Nonetheless, in a series of massacres known as [[Pontianak incidents]], the Japanese assassinated virtually all of the [[West Kalimantan]] Malay sultans, including a large numbers of Malay intelligentsias after they have been falsely accused of planning an uprising and [[coup d'etat]] against the Japanese. It was believed that West Kalimantan took two generations to recover from the near-total collapse of the Malay ruling class in the territory.\n\n===Malay nationalism===\n[[File:TuahNatlHistoryMuseumKL.jpg|thumb|The bronze mural of the legendary Malay warrior, [[Hang Tuah]] with his renowned quote ''Ta' Melayu Hilang Di-Dunia'' ([[Malay language|Malay]] for \"Never shall the Malays vanish from the face of the earth\") written on the top.

In the [[Netherlands Indies]], the struggle against colonisation was characterised by the trans-ethnic nationalism: the so-called \"[[Indonesian National Awakening]]\" united people from the various parts of the Dutch colony in the development of a national consciousness as \"Indonesians\".<ref name=\"Ricklefs, pp. 163-164\">Ricklefs, pp. 163\u2013164.</ref> In Brunei, despite some attempt made to arouse Malay political consciousness between 1942 and 1945, there was no significant history of ethnic-based nationalism. In Thailand however, [[South Thailand insurgency|Pattani separatism]] against Thai rule is regarded by some historians as a part of the wider sphere of peninsula Malay nationalism. A similar [[secession movement]] can be witnessed in modern-day Indonesia, where both autochthonously-Malay provinces of [[Riau]] and [[Riau Islands]] sought to gain independence under the name of Republic of Riau. Nevertheless, what follows is specific to the peninsula Malay nationalism that resulted in the formation of the [[Federation of Malaya]], later reconstituted as Malaysia.\n\nThe earliest and most influential instruments of Malay national awakening were the [[periodical]]s which politicised the position of the Malays in the face of colonialism and alien immigration of non-Malays. In spite of repressions imposed by the British colonial government, there were no less than 147 journals and newspapers published in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] between 1876 and 1941. Among notable periodicals were ''Al-Imam'' (1906), ''Pengasuh'' (1920), ''Majlis'' (1935) and ''[[Utusan Melayu]]'' (1939). The rise of [[Malay nationalism]] was largely mobilised by three nationalist factions \u2013 the radicals distinguishable into the Malay left and the Islamic group which were both opposed to the conservative elites.<ref name=\"Leo Suryadinata\">{{harvnb|Suryadinata|2000|pp=133\u2013136}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Malaya stamp.png|thumb|left|Federation of Malaya's commemorative stamp issued in 1957. The semi-independent federation was formed in 1948 from nine [[Malay states]] and two British [[Straits Settlements]]. It [[Hari Merdeka|achieved independence]] in 1957.]]\nThe Malay [[leftist]]s were represented by [[Kesatuan Melayu Muda]], formed in 1938 by a group of Malay intelligentsia primarily educated in [[Sultan Idris Training College]], with an ideal of ''[[Greater Indonesia]]''. In 1945, they reorganised themselves into a political party known as Partai Kebangsaan Melayu Malaya (PKMM). The [[Islamist]]s were originally represented by ''Kaum Muda'' consisted of Middle east \u2013educated scholars with [[Pan-Islamism|Pan-Islamic]] sentiment. The first Islamic political party was ''Partai Orang Muslimin Malaya'' (Hizbul Muslimin) formed in March 1948, later succeeded by [[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party|Pan-Malayan Islamic Party]] in 1951. The third group was [[Conservatism|the conservatives]] consisted of the westernised elites who were bureaucrats and members of royal families that shared a common English education mostly at the exclusive [[Malay College Kuala Kangsar]]. They formed voluntary organisations known as ''Persatuan Melayu'' ('Malay Associations') in various parts of the country with the primary goals of advancing and protecting the interests of Malays. In March 1946, 41 of these Malay associations formed [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), to assert [[Malay dominance]] over Malaya.<ref name=\"Leo Suryadinata\"/>\n\nThe Malay and [[Malayness]] has been the fundamental basis for Malay ideology and Malay nationalism in Malaysia. All three Malay nationalist factions believed in the idea of a ''Bangsa Melayu'' ('Malay Nation') and the position of Malay language, but disagreed over the role of Islam and Malay rulers. The conservatives supported [[Malay language]], [[Malay Islamic identity|Islam]] and [[Malay rulers|Malay monarchy]] as constituting the key pillars of Malayness, but within a secular state that restricted the political role of Islam. The leftists concurred with the [[secular state]] but wanted to end [[feudalism]], whereas the Islamic group favoured ending royalty but sought a much larger role of [[Islam]].<ref>{{harvnb|Barrington|2006|pp=47\u201348}}</ref>\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Spandoeken tijdens het bezoek van de Wali Negara Sumatera Timur aan Pematangsiantar TMnr 60024766.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Supporters of ''Negara Soematra Timoer'' ([[State of East Sumatra]]) that sought to maintain the monarchy system in [[Aftermath of World War II#Dutch East Indies|post-World War II]] Dutch-established territory of East Sumatra.

The new movement forged a close political link between rulers and subjects never before achieved. It generated an excited Malay public opinion which, together with the surprising political apathy of the non-Malays, led to Britain's abandonment of the radical [[Malayan Union]] plan. By July, UMNO succeeded in obtaining an agreement with the British to begin negotiations for a new constitution. Negotiations continued from August to November, between British officials on the one hand, and the Sultans' representatives and UMNO and the other.<ref name=\"Riwanto Tirtosudarmo\">{{harvnb|Tirtosudarmo|2005}}</ref>\n\nTwo years later the semi independent [[Federation of Malaya]] was born. The new constitutional arrangement largely reverted to the basic pattern of pre-war colonial rule and built on the supremacy of the individual Malay states. Malay rights and privileges were safeguarded. The traditional [[Malay rulers]] thus retained their prerogatives, while their English-educated descendants came to occupy positions of authority at the centre, which was being progressively decolonised. In August 1957, the [[Federation of Malaya]], the West's last major dependency in Southeast Asia, attained independence in a peaceful transfer of power.<ref name=\"Riwanto Tirtosudarmo\"/> The federation was reconstituted as [[Malaysia]] with the addition in 1963 of [[Singapore]] (separated in 1965), [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]].\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Language===\n[[File:Prasasti Kedukan Bukit 3.jpg|thumb|The [[Kedukan Bukit Inscription]] written in [[Vatteluttu|Pallava script]].

An adapted Arabic script called [[Jawi script|Jawi]] was used replacing the Indian script, Islamic religious and cultural terminologies were abundantly assimilated, discarding many Hindu-Buddhist words, and Malay became the language of Islamic medium of instruction and dissemination throughout Southeast Asian region.

Among the forms of poetry in Malay literature are \u2013 the [[Pantun]], [[Syair]] and [[Gurindam]].\n\nThe earliest form of Malay literature was the [[oral literature]] and its central subjects are traditional [[folklore]] relating to [[nature]], animals and people. The classical Malay folklore is composed of traditional songs and music, heroic poems, animal fables, ghost stories, past events, fairy tales, symbolic lore, myths and bardic tales. Each of the stories possessed its own energy in terms of character, spirit, backdrop and storytelling and was largely crafted with the intend of happiness, guidance, educating, reminiscing, explaining, among few. The folklore were memorised and passed from one generation of storytellers to the next. Many of these tales were also written down by ''penglipur lara'' (storytellers) for example: ''[[Hikayat Malim Dewa]]'', ''Hikayat Malim Deman'', ''Hikayat Raja Donan'', ''Hikayat Anggun Cik Tunggal'', and ''[[Hikayat Awang Sulung Merah Muda]]''.\n\nWhen Indian influences made their way to the Malay Archipelago around 2000 years ago, Malay literature began incorporating Indian elements. Literature of this time is mostly translations of [[Sanskrit literature]] and romances, or at least some productions inspired by such, and is full of allusions to [[Hindu mythology]]. Probably to this early time may be traced such works as ''[[Hikayat Seri Rama]]'' (a free translation of the ''[[Ramayana]]''), ''[[Hikayat Bayan Budiman]]'' (an adaptation of [[\u015aukasaptati]]) and ''[[Hikayat Panca Tanderan]]'' (an adaptation of ''[[Hitopadesha]]'').<ref name=\"popular science 1899\">{{harvnb|Ford|1899|pp=379\u2013381}}</ref>\n\nThe era of classical Malay literature started after the arrival of Islam and the invention of [[Jawi script]] (Arabic based Malay script). Since then, Islamic beliefs and concepts began to make its mark on Malay literature. The [[Terengganu Inscription Stone]], which is dated to 1303, is the earliest known narrative Malay writing. The stone is inscribed with an account of history, law, and [[romance (love)|romance]] in Jawi script.<ref name=\"Marshall Cavendish 2007 1218\">{{harvnb|Marshall Cavendish|2007|p=1218}}</ref> At its height, the Malacca Sultanate was not only the center of Islamisation, but also the center of Malay cultural expressions including literature.

The entrance to the [[Petronas Twin Towers]] is adorned with contemporary Malay motifs adapted from traditional [[handicrafts]], including ''[[Songket]]'' and [[wood carvings|timber carvings]] inspired by images of the [[tropical rainforests]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Critical reflections on cities in Southeast Asia|page=201|author=Tim Bunnell, Lisa Barbara Welch Drummond & Kong-Chong Ho|isbn=981-210-192-6|year=2002|publisher=Time Media Private Limited|location=Singapore}}</ref>-->\n\n===Visual art===\n[[File:Burung Petala Indera I.png|thumb|[[Burung Petala Indra]], a giant mythical bird constructed for the grand [[circumcision]] parade of the [[Kelantan]]ese prince.]]\nWood carving is a part of classical Malay [[visual arts]]. The Malays had traditionally adorned their monuments, boats, weapons, tombs, musical instrument, and utensils by motives of flora, calligraphy, geometry and cosmic feature. The art is done by partially removing the wood using sharp tools and following specific patterns, composition and orders. The art form, known as ''ukir'', is hailed as an act of devotion of the craftsmen to the creator and a gift to his fellowmen.<ref>{{harvnb|Ismail Said|2005}}</ref>\n\nThe art form is mainly attributed to the abundance of timber on the [[Malay Archipelago]] and also by the skillfulness of the woodcarvers that have allowed the Malays to practice woodcarving as a craft. The natural tropical settings where flora and fauna and cosmic forces is abundant has inspired the motives to be depict in abstract or styled form into the timber board. With the coming of Islam, geometric and [[Islamic calligraphy]] form were introduced in the wood carving. The woods used are typically from tropical hardwood species which is known to be durable and can resist the attacks of the fungi, power-boots beetles and termites.<ref>{{harvnb|Ismail Said|2002}}</ref>\n\nA typical Malay traditional houses or mosque would have been adorned with more than 20 carved components. The carving on the walls and the panels allow the air breeze to circulate effectively in and out of the building and can let the sunlight to light the interior of the structure. At the same time, the shadow cast by the panels would also create a shadow based on the motives adding the beauty on the floor. Thus, the carved components performed in both functional and aesthetic purposes.\n\n===Pottery===\n[[File:Sayong.jpg|thumb|An ebony-coloured ''Labu Sayong'', a classic Malay [[jar]] from [[Kuala Kangsar]], [[Perak]], Malaysia.]]\nUnder the Malay culture, [[pottery]] is not solely witnessed as a mere household [[List of eating utensils|utensil]]. It is perceived as a work of [[art]], a paradigm of talent, embroidered with aesthetic, legacy, perseverance and religious devotion. The Malay earthen is usually unglazed, with the ornamental designs were carved when the pottery is semi-dried during its construction process.<ref name=\"Travel Malaysia 2012\">{{harvnb|Travel Malaysia|2012}}</ref>\n\nAccording to several studies,<ref name=\"Azmi Arifin 2015\">{{harvnb|Azmi Arifin|2015}}</ref> the native Malay pottery industry has developed indigenously from the period of great antiquity and has since encapsulates a high-level of culture sophistication. It also has been noted that the design features of the Malay pottery suggested the absence of the [[globalisation|foreign influence]] prior to the 19th century, a paradox considering the vast cultural contact between the Malays and the outside world.<ref name=\"Azmi Arifin 2015\"/>\n\nAmong the renowned traditional Malay pottery includes ''Mambong'' of [[Kelantan]], molded from clay and identified with the colour of [[terracotta]]. It is usually assumed the form as cooking utensils. In the west coast, the raven-coloured ''Labu Sayung'' of [[Kuala Kangsar]] is honourned for gourd-formed jars. There are also several variants of ''Labu'', including ''Labu Tela, Labu Kepala, Labu Gelugor Tela'' and ''Labu Gelugor Kepala''.<ref name=\"Travel Malaysia 2012\"/>\n\nOther forms of Malay traditional pottery are: The ''Belanga'', commonly in a wide rim and a round base, the pot usually mobilised to cook [[curries]]. It is held that the structure of the earthen would aid the heat to be evenly distributed, correlating to its round base. A smaller version of the ''Belanga'' is called ''periok'', used for [[rice]]-preparation; The ''Buyong'', commonly defined by a straight collar and a spherical body, oftentime used as a water jar; The ''Terenang'', the angular ''Terenang'' is used as a canister, especially in the coastal Malay regions of [[Kelantan]], [[Pattani]] and [[Terengganu]]; The ''Bekas Bara'', a small container, usually crafted for the use of [[incense]]; The ''Jambangan'', a traditional Malay [[vase]], usually for aesthetic purposes and ''Geluk'', a small water storage.<ref name=\"Cikgu Paklong 2017\">{{harvnb|Cikgu Paklong|2017}}</ref>\n\n===Cuisine===\n[[File:Itek Masak Lomak Cili Api.jpg|thumb|''Itek Masak Lomak Cili Api'', [[Smoked meat|smoked duck]] with thick, creamy, savoury and spicy sauce, usually eaten with [[white rice]].

The [[coconut milk]] is also important in giving the Malay dishes their rich, creamy character. The other foundation is ''[[belacan]]'' (shrimp paste), which is used as a base for ''sambal'', a rich sauce or condiment made from belacan, [[Chili pepper|chillies]], onions and garlic. Malay cooking also makes plentiful use of [[lemongrass]] and [[galangal]].<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2006|p=58}}</ref>\n\nNearly every Malay meal is served with rice, the [[staple food]] in many other East Asian cultures. Although there are various type of dishes in a Malay meal, all are served at once, not in courses. Food is eaten delicately with the fingers of right hand, never with the left which is used for personal ablutions, and Malays rarely use utensils.<ref>{{harvnb|Marshall Cavendish|2007|p=1222}}</ref> Because most of Malay people are Muslims, Malay cuisine follows Islamic [[halal]] dietary law rigorously. Protein intake are mostly taken from beef, water buffalo, goat, and lamb meat, and also includes poultry and fishes. Pork and any non-halal meats, also alcohol is prohibited and absent from Malay daily diet.\n\n[[Nasi lemak]], rice cooked in rich [[coconut milk]] probably is the most popular dish ubiquitous in Malay town and villages. Nasi lemak is considered as [[Malaysia]]'s [[national dish]].<ref>{{harvnb|Malaysia.com|2011}}</ref> While ''Nasi Minyak'' and ''Nasi Hujan Panas'', rice broiled with ghee and spices is hailed as a ceremonial dish for special occasions, especially during the traditional Malay weddings.\n\nAnother example is [[Ketupat]] or ''nasi himpit'', glutinous compressed rice cooked in palm leaves, is popular especially during ''Idul Fitri'' or ''Hari Raya'' or [[Eid ul-Fitr]]. Various meats and vegetables could be made into [[Gulai]] or [[Curry|Kari]], a type of curry dish with variations of spices mixtures that clearly display Indian influence already adopted by Malay people since ancient times. [[Laksa]], a hybrid of Malay and Peranakan Chinese cuisine is also a popular dish. Malay cuisine also adopted and received visible influence from some of their closest neighbours' cuisine traditions, such as [[rendang]] adopted from the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]]s in [[West Sumatra|Pagaruyung]], and [[satay]] from Java, however Malay people has developed their own distinctive taste and recipes.\n\n===Performing arts===\n[[File:ShowMakyonginRama5.jpg|thumb|A troupe of [[Thai Malays|Siamese Malay]] dancers performing the [[Mak Yong]] during the reign of [[Chulalongkorn|King Rama V of Siam]] (c. 19th century), a dance theatre that owes its origin from the [[Pattani]] and [[Kelantanese]] palace courts. In 2005, it received recognition as being among the [[Intangible cultural heritage|masterpieces of the oral and intangible heritage of humanity]] by [[UNESCO]].]]\nThe Malays have diverse kinds of music and dance which are fusions of different cultural influences. Typical genres range from traditional Malay folk dances dramas like [[Mak Yong]] to the Arab-influenced [[Zapin]] dances. Choreographed movements also vary from simple steps and tunes in [[Dikir barat]] to the complicated moves in [[Joget]] [[Gamelan]].\n\nTraditional Malay music is basically percussive. Various kinds of [[gongs]] provide the beat for many dances. There are also drums of various sizes, ranging from the large ''rebana ubi'' used to punctuate important events to the small ''jingled-rebana'' ([[frame drum]]) used as an accompaniment to vocal recitations in religious ceremonies.<ref>{{harvnb|Moore|1998|p=48}}</ref>\n\n[[Royal Regalia of Malaysia#Nobat|Nobat]] music became part of the [[Royal Regalia]] of Malay courts since the arrival of Islam in the 12th century and only performed in important court ceremonies. Its orchestra includes the sacred and highly revered instruments of ''nehara'' ([[kettledrums]]), ''gendang'' (double-headed drums), ''nafiri'' (trumpet), ''serunai'' ([[oboe]]), and sometimes a knobbed [[gong]] and a pair of [[cymbals]].<ref>{{harvnb|Marshall Cavendish|2007|p=1220}}</ref>\n\nIndian influences are strong in a traditional [[shadow play]] known as [[Wayang Kulit]] where stories from Hindu epics; [[Ramayana]] & [[Mahabharata]] form the main repertoire. There are four distinctive types of shadow puppet theatre that can be found in Malay peninsula; ''Wayang Gedek'', ''Wayang Purwa'', ''Wayang Melayu'' and ''Wayang Siam''.<ref>{{harvnb|Srinivasa|2003|p=296}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Ghulam Sarwar Yousof|1997|p=3}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Matusky|1993|pp=8\u201311}}</ref> Nonetheless, the art and the storytelling of ''Wayang Purwa'' and ''Wayang Siam'' denote a regional influence in fused with the Javanese and Siamese respectively, while ''Wayang Melayu'' and ''Wayang Gedek'' narrated a more autochthonously Malay form and fashion.\n\nOther well-known Malay performing arts are; ''[[Bangsawan]]'' theatre, ''[[Dondang Sayang]]'' love ballad and ''[[Mak Inang]]'' dance from Malacca Sultanate, ''[[Jikey]]'' and ''[[Mek Mulung]]'' theatre from [[Kedah]], ''[[Asyik]]'' dance and ''[[Menora (dance)|Menora]]'' dance drama from [[Pattani (region)|Patani]] and [[Kelantan]], ''[[Ulek mayang]]'' and ''[[Rodat (dance)|Rodat]]'' dance from Terengganu, ''[[Boria (theatre)|Boria]]'' theatre from [[Penang]], ''Canggung'' dance from [[Perlis]], ''Mukun'' narrative songs from [[Brunei]] and [[Sarawak]],<ref>{{harvnb|Marzuki bin Haji Mohd Seruddin|2009}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Mysarawak.org|2009}}</ref><ref name=\"Ahmad Salehuddin 2009\">{{harvnb|Ahmad Salehuddin|2009}}</ref> [[Gending Sriwijaya]] from [[Palembang]],''Serampang Dua Belas'' dance from [[Sultanate of Serdang|Serdang]].<ref name=\"Ahmad Salehuddin 2009\"/> and [[Zapin Api|Zapin Api firedance]] from [[Riau]].\n\n===Traditional dress===\n[[File:HariRayaMalaykids.jpg|thumb|right|Malay children wearing traditional dress during [[Eid al-Fitr]].]]\n{{Main|Baju Melayu|Baju Kurung}}\nThe traditional Malay apparel and textile has been continuously morphed since the time of antiquity. Historically, the ancient Malays were chronicled to incorporate various natural materials as a vital source for fabrics, clothing and attire. The common era however, witnessing the early arrivals the merchants from east and west to the harbours of Malay archipelago, together they bought new luxurious items, including fine cotton and silks. The garments subsequently become a source of high Malay fashion and acquired a cultural role as the binding identity in the archipelago, especially in the Peninsula, Sumatra and the coastal areas of Borneo.<ref name=\"Hanisa Hassan 2016 1\">{{harvnb|Hanisa Hassan|2016|p=1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wacanaseni.usm.my/WACANA%20SENI%20JOURNAL%20OF%20ARTS%20DISCOURSE/wacanaseni_v15/WS_15_3.pdf |title=A Study on the Development of Baju Kurung Design in the Context of Cultural Changes in Modern Malaysia|last=Hanisa Hassan|publisher=Perpustakaan Negara Malaysia|accessdate=22 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn Malay culture, clothes and textiles are revered as symbols of beauty, power and status. Numerous accounts in [[List of Hikayat|Malay hikayats]] stressed the special place occupied by textiles.<ref>{{harvnb|Maznah Mohammad|1996|p=2}}</ref> The Malay handloom industry can be traced its origin since the 13th century when the eastern trade route flourished under [[Song dynasty]]. Mention of locally made textiles as well as the predominance of weaving in [[Malay peninsular]] was made in various Chinese and Arab accounts.<ref>{{harvnb|Maznah Mohammad|1996|p=19}}</ref> Among well-known Malay textiles are [[Songket]], [[Malaysian batik|Batik]], ''Telepok'', ''Limar'', ''Tenun'', ''Kelingkam'', ''Cindai'', ''Pelangi'' and ''Tekad''.\n\nClassical Malay dress varies between different regions, but the most profound traditional dress in modern-day are Baju Kurung (for women) and Baju Melayu (for men), which both recognised as the national dress for Malaysia and Brunei, and also worn by Malay communities in Indonesia, Singapore, Myanmar and Thailand.\n\nThe word ''Baju Kurung'', literary defined as \"encase the body\" of the wearer is tailored based on the Islamic principles of modesty, decency and humility. The practice is parallel to the [[Judaeo-Christian]] religious doctrine, as flaunting the [[Intimate parts in Islam|intimate body parts]] is considered as forbidden in Islam. The interpretation was then absorbed to the Malay way of dressing and cultural perspective, this can be strongly witnessed upon the rule of [[Mansur Shah of Malacca]] in the 15th century, the sultan prohibited his female Muslim subjects in the public from wearing only a sarong from the bust downwards. Throughout the ages, The Malay Baju Kurung went into several reincarnation before assuming its current form. Due to the vastness of various Malay kingdoms in the [[Malay archipelago|archipelago]], local and distinct forms of the Baju Kurung design patterns can also be witnessed in the region, including Bengkulu, Kedah, Jambi, Johor-Riau, Pahang and Palembang.<ref name=\"Hanisa Hassan 2016 1\"/>\n\nThe corresponding mode of Baju Kurung for men is known as \"Baju Melayu\". The upper part of the garment was made with the geometrical design almost similar with Baju Kurung and commonly paired with woven cloth known as the sarong. The pattern of the sarong may possessed a symbol of the person's marital status or the rank in the classical Malay society.<ref name=\"Hanisa Hassan 2016 1\"/>\n\nOther common classical Malay attire for men consists of a ''baju'' (shirt) or ''tekua'' (a type of a long sleeve shirt), ''baju rompi'' (vest), ''kancing'' (button), a small leg ''celana'' (trousers), a [[sarong]] worn around the waist, ''capal'' (sandal), and a ''tanjak'' or ''tengkolok'' ([[headgear]]); for the aristocrats, the ''baju sikap'' or ''baju layang'' (a type of coat) and ''pending'' (ornamental belt buckle) are also synonymous to be worn as a formal attire. It was also common for a ''pendekar'' (Malay warrior) to have a [[Kris]] tucked into the front fold of sarong.\n\nIn contrast to Baju Melayu which continued to be worn as ceremonial dress only, Baju Kurung is worn daily throughout the year by a majority of Malay women. Sighting of female civil servants, professional workers and students wearing Baju Kurung is common in Malaysia and Brunei.\n\n===Festivals and celebrations===\n[[File:Majlis Tujuh Likor Pasang Pelita.jpg|thumb|Rows of Pelita ([[oil lamps]]) lighted during ''Malam Tujuh Likur'' (the 27th night of [[Ramadhan]]), the oil lamps are traditionally used to illuminate homes and the streets during the Ramadhan. Seen here in [[Muar town|Muar]], Johor, Malaysia]]\nThe rise of [[Islam]] managed to [[ethnogenesis|redefine]] the [[Malayness|Malay identity]] by the 15th century. Thus, resulting most of the Malay festivals and celebrations to run parallel with the [[Islamic calendar]], albeit deeply ingrained with a strong sense of [[Malayisation|Malay character]]. The biannual [[Hari Raya]] (lit \"the Great Day\") observance of [[Aildifitri]] and [[Aidiladha]] are hailed as the grand celebrations universally across the Malay community. The two holidays are instrumental to commentate two major events and philosophy in the Islamic teaching and beliefs. The former signifies the triumph as a Muslim after a month of [[Fasting in Islam|fasting]] and patience in [[Ramadan]], while the latter is to observe the sacrifice made by [[Ibrahim]] (Abraham) under the name of [[Allah]].\n\nThe ''Raya'' holidays usually commenced during the [[wikt:homecoming|homecoming]] event known as [[Balik Kampung]] or ''Balik Raya'' which occurred a few days before the festival. During the Hari Raya, the Malays would celebrated by performing the [[Eid prayers]], holding a grand feast and visiting friends, relatives and neighbours. A visit to the grave of the departed loved ones is also essential, as a sign of respect, love and honour.\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Plechtigheden bij de kroning van de Sultan van Deli in 1925 op de troon de sultan en zijn echtgenote met aan weerszijden de rijkssieraden TMnr 10001572.jpg|thumb|The coronation ceremony between Tengku Otteman, as the ''Tengku Mahkota'' (Crown Prince) of [[Sultanate of Deli|Deli Sultanate]] in Residency of Sumatra's East Coast, [[Dutch East Indies]]; with his wife, Raja Amnah, daughter of [[Raja Chulan]] and a member of [[Perak Sultanate|Perak Royalty]] as ''Tengku Puan Indera'' in 1925.]]\nOther major liturgical and religious ceremonies celebrated by the Malays include [[Ramadhan]], a month-long holy month devoted by daytime fasting and various religious activities; [[Maulidur Rasul]], a special grand procession to honour the birth of Prophet [[Muhammad]]; [[Ashura]], remembrance of [[Muharram]] where the Malays would solemnly prepared a special dish, known as ''Bubur Ashura''; [[Nisfu Syaaban]], the Mid-[[Sha'ban]] observance, a special day of [[fasting]] for forgiveness; [[Nuzul Quran]], the first the revelation of the [[Quran]]; [[Israk dan Mikraj]], the ascension Prophet Muhammed to the heavens and [[Awal Muharram]], the Islamic New Year; the latter three celebrations are usually observed by holding a special ''sunat'' prayers, religious lectures and Islamic discussions in the [[mosque]].\n\nThere are also a plethora of domestic regional cultural festivals and social events within different the Malay spheres. The coastal areas were historically known to observed the ''Mandi Safar'' or ''Puja Pantai'' ceremony, a purifying bath during the [[Islamic calendar|Islamic month]] of [[Safar]], originally emulated from the ancient pre-Islamic Malay holy cleansing rituals; and ''Pesta Menuai'', a [[harvest festival]] celebrated by the inland and agrarian Malay communities by traditional games, theatre, [[Joget]] and other repertoire of dance-play. However, both of the practice is gradually extinct owing from various social and economic revolution engineered in the Malay community in the 20th century. Additionally, many Malays are also known to participate in the imperial celebrations to honour the royal courts of their respective kingdoms.\n\nThe Islamic features also strongly embroidered the Malay celebrations in the individual level, a juxtaposition bonded to the spiritual [[rite of passage]] as a Muslim. The Malays would usually organised ''kenduri'', a religious ceremonial banquet to celebrate or to seek blessing for an event. There are several philosophical variations of kenduri, raging from ''Doa Selamat'' (asking for divine favour and protection), ''Kesyukuran'' (for thanksgiving and gratitude), ''Melenggang Perut'' (ceremonial massage for a mother who is pregnant with her first child), ''Aqiqah'' and ''Cukur Jambul'' (newborn ceremony, for celebrating a new life), ''Bertindik'' (the first piercing ceremony for a female child), ''Khatam'' (a graduation ceremony, after a child's first full-reading of the [[Quran]]), ''Khatan'' ([[circumcision]]),  ''Kahwin'' ([[wedding]]), ''Arwah'' or ''Tahlil'' (prayers for a deceased person),  among few. The event is usually organised by the family and was traditionally aided by the community in a social gathering known as ''Rewang'' or ''Gotong-royong''. During this ceremony, the whole family would be assisted by their neighbours and relatives, delegating various tasks raging from food preparations, venue management, logistic assembly and other technical control. Nevertheless, following the rise of [[urbanism]] in the contemporary Malay community, the practice of ''Rewang/Gotong-Royong'' is gradually superseded by hired-[[catering|caterer]] services by the family.\n\n===Martial arts===\n[[File:Silat Melayu Keris Lok 9.jpg|thumb|A [[Silat Melayu]] performance on a stage.]]\n{{Main|Silat|Silat Melayu}}\nSilat and its variants can be found throughout the Malay world: the [[Malay peninsula]] (including [[Singapore]]), the [[Riau Islands]], [[Sumatra]] and coastal areas of [[Borneo]]. Archaeological evidence reveals that, by the 6th century, formalised combat arts were being practised in the Malay peninsular and Sumatra.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1994|p=73}}</ref> The earliest forms of Silat are believed to have been developed and used in the armed forces of the ancient Malay kingdoms of [[Langkasuka]] (2nd century)<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2006|p=225}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Abd. Rahman Ismail|2008|p=188}}</ref> and Srivijaya (7th century).\n\nThe influence of the Malay sultanates of Malacca, [[Johor Sultanate|Johor]], [[Pattani Kingdom|Pattani]] and [[Brunei Sultanate|Brunei]] has contributed to the spread of this martial art in the Malay Archipelago. Through a complex maze of sea channels and river capillaries that facilitated exchange and trade throughout the region, Silat wound its way into the dense rainforest and up into the mountains. The legendary [[Laksamana]] [[Hang Tuah]] of Malacca is one of the most renowned ''pesilat'' (Silat practitioners) in history<ref>{{harvnb|Green|2001|p=802}}</ref> and even considered by some as the father of Malay silat.<ref>{{harvnb|Sheikh Shamsuddin|2005|p=195}}</ref> Since the classical era, [[Silat Melayu]] underwent great diversification and formed what is today traditionally recognised as the source of Indonesian [[Pencak Silat]] and other forms of Silat in Southeast Asia.<ref>{{harvnb|Draeger|1992|p=23}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Farrer|2009|p=28}}</ref>\n\nApart from Silat, [[Tomoi]] is also practised by Malays, mainly in the northern region of the Malay peninsula. It is a variant of [[Indochina|Indo-Chinese]] forms of [[kickboxing]] which is believed to have been spread in the Southeast Asian mainland since the time of [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan Empire]] (68&nbsp;AD).\n\n===Metal casting===\n[[File:Bunga Mas (Muzium Negara).jpg|thumb|The [[Bunga Mas]], [[National Museum of Malaysia]]. Literary translated as the \"Golden Flowers\", the Bunga Mas was offered by the northern Malay states of [[Terengganu]], [[Kelantan]], [[Kedah]], [[Patani Kingdom|Pattani]], [[Nong Chik District|Nong Chik]], [[Yala Province|Yala]], [[Ra-ngae District|Rangae]], [[Kubang Pasu Darul Qiyam|Kubang Pasu]] and [[Kingdom of Setul Mambang Segara|Setul]] to the King of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] ([[Siam]]) as a symbol of allegiance.]]\nIn the Malay society, classical [[metalworks]] assumed a role more than a mere instrumental tool. It serves as a testament of [[culture]], cultivated by [[art]]istic appreciation and [[religious]] symbol, molded by a craftsman who possessed a talent to redefined the essence of nature in the most ornamental manner. The artform has indeed received a long existence in the [[Malay World]], observations made by the [[Arab people|Arabs]] on the courts of [[Srivijaya]] narrated that about the abundance of golds in the [[Palembang|capital]], till the extend that the bars have to be ceremonially thrown into the [[estuary]] in a daily basis. On the Chinese accounts, the area was occasionally hailed as ''Jinzou'', the [[gold]] coast. The zenith of Srivijaya also witnessed the arrivals of [[silver]] bought by the foreign merchants, which then spread to the members of Malay aristocracy.<ref name=\"Shaffer 1955\">{{harvnb|Shaffer|1955}}</ref>\n\nUpon the turn of the 17th century, gold, silver, [[iron]] and [[brass]] have all been perfectly molded to become part and parcel to the Malay society. The era witnessed the works of metal received a critical royal patronage. A multitude of Malay metalworks manifested as evidence of this era, raging from a peculiar Malay dagger known as [[Keris]] made of iron, down to the elaborate fine [[jewellery]] made from the splendor of gold and silver. For the Malay nobles during this period, the works of pending (ornamental [[Belt buckle]] embellished with [[precious stones]]), ''keronsang'' (brooch) and ''cucuk sanggul'' (hairpins) were staged to become among the most sought item of fashion. The era also hosted a number of other prominent items in the Malay regalia cast in gold, including ceremonial box, ''Tepak sirih'' (Betel container) and parts of Keris. The art of casting gold were predominantly done by [[repouss\u00e9]] and [[Granulation (process)|granulation]] techniques, in which the traditional methods can still be witnessed until today. In the contemporary era, the Malay gold jewels are mainly found in the form of anklets, bracelets, rings, necklaces, pendants and earrings.<ref name=\"Malaysia Handicrafts ~ Gold Silver & Brass 2011\">{{harvnb|Malaysia Handicrafts ~ Gold Silver & Brass|2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Karyaneka 2013\">{{harvnb|Karyaneka|2013}}</ref>\n\nFor the Malay silverware, the works of silver are fairly known for its sophisticated and fine designs. It is usually crafted in the form of repousse, [[filigree]] and [[Niello|neillowork]]. Among the common traditional Malay items usually made of silver includes pillow ends, belt buckles, matt corners, stoppers for water vessels, Keris sheaths and tobacco boxes. The ''Awan Larat'' (cloud patterns) and ''Kerawang'' (Vegetal motives) are among the popular designs for Malay decorative silver pillow ends and tobacco boxes.<ref name=\"Malaysia Handicrafts ~ Gold Silver & Brass 2011\"/>\n\nThe usage of brassware transcends a plethora of classical Malay social classes, being used by the members of nobility and commoners alike. The popularity of brassware is heavily contributed due to its durability, quality and affordability to all. The brassware can be narrowed into two distinctions, yellow brass for functional items and white for [[Ornamental brassware|decorative purposes]]. It is often meticulously hammered and craved with various decorative designs in [[Islamic arts|religious]] and floral motives. The usage of brass however, is best known for [[Tepak Sireh]], a ceremonial tray for betel quid and for constructing certain musical instruments such as [[Gong]]s for the classical Malay [[Gamelan]] orchestra. Additionally, other prominent traditional Malay items made from metal includes flower vases, perfume sprinkles, serving trays, cooking pots, kettle and incense burners.<ref name=\"Malaysia Handicrafts ~ Gold Silver & Brass 2011\"/><ref name=\"Karyaneka 2013\"/>\n\n===Weaponry===\n[[File:Malay Keris.jpg|thumb|A Malay Keris, with its sheath on the left.

The absence of a Keris on a man was frowned upon, perceived as if he were parading naked to the public. Traditionally, a man of Malay extraction would own three types of Keris: ''Keris Pusaka'' (the Dynasty Keris, inherited from one generation to another), ''Keris Pangkat'' (the Status Keris, awarded in right of his position in Malay society) and ''Keris Perjuangan Dirinya'' (the Struggle Keris, literally defined as his personal Keris). There are many strict rules, regulations and taboos to be adhered to in owning a Keris.<ref name=\"Angahsunan 2017\"/> The blade of a Kris is usually coated in a venomous arsenic, thus crafting an excruciatingly lethal blade for its prey.<ref name=\"Faizal Izzani Zakaria 2016\"/> Traditionally, each Keris is also regarded as possessing a [[spirit]], known as ''semangat''. Special rituals were to be conducted to nurture, preserve and guard the \"soul\" of the weapon.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.thepatriots.asia/archives/4275 |title=Archived copy |access-date=20 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923024340/https://www.thepatriots.asia/archives/4275 |archive-date=23 September 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The spiritual approach is usually held every ''Malam Jumaat'' (Thursday night), with the blade is being purified with [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] and smoked with [[incense]], dedicated prayers and devoted mantras would be also recited upon to complement the mystic ritual.<ref name=\"Irma Musliana 2016\">{{harvnb|Irma Musliana|2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Istinggar Melayu.jpg|thumb|The [[Trigger (firearms)|trigger mechanism]] of an ''[[Istinggar]]'', a classical Malay gun as displayed in ''Muzium Warisan Melayu'' (Malay Heritage Museum), [[Seri Kembangan|Serdang]], [[Selangor]]. It was the result of Indo-European gun making and Malay gun making. Before the [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|fall of Malacca]] (1511), already existed malay firearm called ''bedil'', or [[Java arquebus]].]]\nThe Malays and Javanese are abided by contrasting philosophical [[values]] pertaining to Keris-wearing. Traditionally, a Malay would embedded his Keris from the front, an honour that the weapon is more paramount compared to the wearer and a constant reminder that one is always equipped to combat the nemesis. The Javanese however, adhered to the principle that he should be more cautious and the Keris may solely be exercised during the time of need, thus cladding their Keris from behind. The Javanese also believed that by mobilising their weapon that position, it would confused the enemy.<ref name=\"Angahsunan 2017\"/>\n\nParadoxically, both groups shared a similar ideology addressing the [[Kris#Hilt|hilt]] of the Keris. If the hilt faced up front, it serves as a testament that the man is prepared for a fight. Nevertheless, if the hilt is turned behind, it is an oath that the person is embracing for a [[Conflict resolution|reconciliation]].<ref name=\"Angahsunan 2017\"/>\n\nThere are also a plethora of other forms of weaponry in the Malay arsenal, all were nevertheless equally revered in a correlating manner as the Keris. The Malays would classified the traditional weapons under 7 different structures: ''Tuju'' (\"Direct\", the large and heavy artillery, including the Malay [[cannons]] of ''Meriam'', ''Ekor Lontong'', ''Lela'' and ''Rentaka''), ''Bidik'' (\"[[Gun]]\", a weapon with metal tube propelled by an [[ammunition]], with the Malay forms of ''Terakor'' and ''Istingar''), ''Setubuh'' (\"A body\", weapon in the similar dimension of a [[human body]], referred to the Malay [[spears]] of ''Tongkat Panjang'' and ''Lembing''), ''Selengan'' (\"An arm\", a large [[saber]] from the length of the shoulders to the tips of the fingers, constituting the Malay saber of ''Pedang'' and ''Sundang''), ''Setangan'' (\"A hand\", a sword with the diameter measured from the elbow to the 3 fingers, including ''Badik Panjang'' and ''Tekpi''), ''Sepegang'' (\"A hold\", smaller than the ''Setangan'', a [[dagger]] with ''Keris'' and ''Badik'' in the category) and ''Segenggam'' (\"A grab\", the smallest in the category, the hand-sized [[blade]], including ''Lawi Ayam'', ''Kerambit'', ''Kuku Macan'' and ''Kapak Binjai'').<ref name=\"Kerawang Merah 2017\">{{harvnb|Kerawang Merah|2017}}</ref> Other items in the traditional Malay weaponry includes ''sumpit'' ([[Blowgun|Blowpipe]]) and ''Busur dan Panah'' ([[Bow and Arrow]]), which are distinct from the seven class of armaments. Additionally, the Malays also would deploy ''Zirah'', a type of ''Baju Besi'' ([[armour]]) and ''Perisai'' ([[shield]]) as defense mechanisms during the [[armed conflict]].\n\n===Traditional games===\n[[File:Finished wau and wau frame.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Wau bulan|Wau]]-maker's workshop in [[Kelantan]], Malaysia. This peculiar type of kite can be found in the northeast coast of Malay Peninsular.]]\nTraditional Malay games usually require craft skills and manual dexterity and can be traced their origins since the days of Malacca Sultanate. ''[[Sepak Raga]]'' and [[kite flying]] are among traditional games that were mentioned in the [[Malay Annals]] being played by nobilities and royalties of the Malay sultanate.<ref>{{harvnb|Leyden|1821|p=261}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Lockard|2009|p=48}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Ooi|2004|p=1357}}</ref>\n\n''[[Sepak Raga]]'' is one of the most popular Malay games and has been played for centuries. Traditionally, Sepak raga was played in circle by kicking and keeps aloft the rattan ball using any part of the body except the arms and hands. It is now recognised as [[Malaysia]]'s national sport<ref>{{harvnb|Ziegler|1972|p=41}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|McNair|2002|p=104}}</ref> and played in the international sporting events such as [[Asian Games]] and [[Southeast Asian Games]].\n\n[[File:Gasing.jpg|thumb|A close-up to two Malay style ''[[Top|Gasings]]''.]]\nOther popular game is [[top|''Gasing'' spinning]] which usually played after the [[harvest]] season. A great skill of [[Artisan|craftsmanship]] is required to produce the most competitive ''Gasing'' (top), some of which spin for two hours at a time.<ref name=\"Alexander 2006 51\">{{harvnb|Alexander|2006|p=51}}</ref>\n\nPossibly the most popular Malay games is the ''[[Wau bulan|Wau]]'' (a unique kind of kite from east coast of Malay peninsular) or kite flying. Wau-flying competitions take place with judges awarding points for craftsmanship (''Wau'' are beautiful, colourful objects set on bamboo frames), sound (all [[Malay kite]]s are designed to create a specific sound as they are buffeted about in the wind) and altitude.<ref name=\"Alexander 2006 51\"/>\n\nThe Malays also have a variant of [[Mancala]] board game known as [[Congkak]]. The game is played by moving stones, marbles, beads or shells around a wooden board consisting of twelve or more holes. Mancala is acknowledged as the oldest game in the world and can be traced its origin since [[Ancient Egypt]].\nAs the game dispersed around the globe, every culture has invented its own variation including the Malays.<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2006|p=52}}</ref>\n\n===Names and titles===\n{{Main|Malay names|Malay styles and titles}}\nMalay personal names are complex, reflecting the hierarchical nature of the society, and titles are considered important. It has undergone tremendous change, evolving with the times to reflect the different influences that the Malays been subjected over the ages. Although some Malay names still retain parts of its indigenous [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] influences, as Muslims, Malays have long favoured [[Arabic names]] as marks of their religion.\n\nMalay names are [[patronymic]] and can be consisted of up to four parts; a title, a given name, the family name, and a description of the individual's male parentage. Some given names and father's names can be composed of double names and even triple names, therefore generating a longer name. For example, one of the Malaysian national footballer has the full name [[Mohd Zaquan Adha Abdul Radzak]], where 'Mohd Zaquan Adha' is his triple given name and 'Abdul Radzak' is his father's double given name.\n\nIn addition to naming system, the [[Malay language]] also has an elaborate system of [[titles]] and [[honorifics]], which are still extensively used in [[Malaysia]] and [[Brunei]]. By applying these [[Malay titles]] to a normal Malay name, a more complex name is produced. The former [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]] has the full name [[Najib Tun Razak|Dato' Seri Mohd Najib bin Tun Haji Abdul Razak]], where 'Dato' Seri' is a Malay title of honour, 'Mohd Najib' is his personal name, 'bin' is derived from an Arabic word Ibnu meaning \"son of\" if in case of daughter it is replaced with binti, an Arabic word \"bintun\" meaning \"daughter of\", introduces his father's titles and names, 'Tun' is a higher honour, 'Haji' denotes his father's [[Hajj]] pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], and 'Abdul Razak' is his father's personal name.\nThe more extremely complex Malay names however, belong to the Malay royalties. The reigning [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] of [[Malaysia]] has the full regnal name [[Abdullah of Pahang|Kebawah Duli Yang Maha Mulia Seri Paduka Baginda Yang di-Pertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri'ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah ibni Almarhum Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah Al-Musta'in Billah]], while the reigning [[Sultan of Brunei]] officially known as [[Hassanal Bolkiah|Kebawah Duli Yang Maha Mulia Paduka Seri Baginda Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'izzaddin Waddaulah ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Haji Omar 'Ali Saifuddien Sa'adul Khairi Waddien]].\n\n==Sub-ethnic groups==\n[[File:Indonesia Ethnic Groups Map English.svg|thumb|center|upright=3.2|Ethnic Malays among other ethnic groups in Indonesia. Although only constituting 3.4% of the total population, ethnic Malays are one of the most widely distributed ethnicities in Indonesia. The realm of Malays is described in green and other related sub-ethnic groups are rendered in darker or lighter green. Malay ethnic groups are shown as inhabiting the eastern coast of Sumatra and coastal Kalimantan. Outside the Indonesian archipelago in white, the Malay people inhabit the Malay peninsula, forming the dominant ethnic group in Peninsular Malaysia and a significant minority in Singapore, Thailand and southern Myanmar.
