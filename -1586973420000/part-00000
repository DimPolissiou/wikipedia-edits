The player takes the role of \"Master\" and commands a group of individuals called \"Servants\", who are typically historical, literary, and mythological figures from various cultures. The player commands a party composed of up to 6 Servants in each battle, 3 active members and 3 reserve members. In each turn, the player is given a set of 5 Command Cards and may use up to 3 of them in a turn to attack. Each Servant has 5 cards the player may use; the cards for all the Servants on the field are shuffled and dealt to the player each turn. The cards have three types: Buster (a heavy attack), Arts (a medium attack that charges a gauge for the Servant's \"Noble Phantasm\"), and Quick (a light attack that generates Critical Stars that increase the probability of critical hits next turn). If three similar cards are used in one turn, they create a \"Chain\" which gives a bonus based on the cards' properties. If three cards all corresponding to the same servant are selected, then a \"Brave Chain\" will ensue, resulting in an extra, more powerful, attack being added onto the end. Each Servant also has skills that can be used before drawing Command Cards; each skill gives effects in the battle, as well as a special command card called \"Noble Phantasm\" that appears when the gauge is full. The \"Master\" also has a separate set of skills and special abilities called \"Command Spells.\" Command Spells have a variety of effects and recharge based on real-world time.\n\nServants are obtained via a [[gacha game|gacha]] mechanic.  Saint Quartz, an in-game currency earned both by playing the game and via real money [[In-app purchasing|in-app purchases]], is used to summon new Servants and acquire \"Craft Essences\" which give additional effects when equipped to a servant.  This summoning is random, with some servants available commonly, and others rarely.  Another currency is \"Friend Points\", which are more easily acquired, but only can acquire common Servants with them.  If multiple copies of the same Servant are acquired, that servant's power is slightly increased. \n==Plot==\n{{see also|List of Fate/Grand Order characters}}\n\nIn 2015, the Chaldea Security Organization draws on experts of both the magical and mundane fields to observe the future of mankind for possible extinction events. Humanity's survival seems assured for the next century\u2014until the verdict suddenly changes, and now eradication of the species awaits at the end of 2016. The cause is unknown, but appears to be linked with the Japanese town of Fuyuki and the events of 2004 during the Fifth Holy Grail War.\n\nIn response, Chaldea harnesses an experimental means of time travel, the Rayshift technology. With it, Ritsuka Fujimaru (a young man or woman, depending on the player's choice of gender) was newly recruited to the organization, and a mysterious girl named Mash Kyrielight, can travel back to 2004 and discover how to save humanity. A grand order to fight fate has been declared\u2014an order to change the past and restore the future.<ref>{{cite web|title=\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\uff5cFate/Grand Order \u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8|url=http://www.fate-go.jp/world/story.html|website=Fate/Grand Order \u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8|access-date=1 December 2016|language=Japanese|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201214933/http://www.fate-go.jp/world/story.html|archive-date=1 December 2016|df=}}</ref> Following the events in Fuyuki, Ritsuka Fujimaru and Mash Kyrielight must restore the Foundation of Humanity by retrieving powerful Holy Grails. The Grails, which are capable of granting any wish, are also able to sustain abnormalities that threaten humanity's existence. The protagonists utilize Rayshift technology to travel back in time to said periods, ranging from Orleans to Okeanos and even the ancient civilization of Babylonia. Along the way, Ritsuka encounters the main antagonist and mastermind behind the plan to eradicate humanity: the Mage-King Solomon. He proclaims that Chaldea's attempt to save humanity will not matter if they fail to obtain every single Holy Grail, before leaving. After obtaining all 7 Holy Grails, Fujimaru and their Servant advance into Ars Paulina, the throne where Solomon once sat. In the final battle against Solomon and his legion of 72 Demon Gods, both Ritsuka and Mash are unable to defeat any of the Demon Pillars as they regenerate immediately. When all hope seems lost, the Servants that assisted Fujimaru on their quest through every singularity appear, allowing Chaldea to break through and defeat Solomon, who is revealed to be the Demon God Goetia, a beast that possessed Solomon's corpse and wishes to eradicate humanity in order to travel back to the dawn of humankind. Goetia is swiftly dispatched, but not before Mash utilizes her Noble Phantasm to deflect Goetia's Noble Phantasm to protect Fujimaru in exchange for her life. Just as hope was lost, Romani appeared and revealed that he himself is actually the real Solomon, the Grand Caster who wished to be human after the fifth holy grail war. Using his only Noble Phantasm to erase himself from existence and weaken Goetia, he then said his goodbyes to Ritsuka and in order for him to defeat Goetia once and for all. Upon the final Singularity being restored to order, Mash is revived via the power of Beast IV, who is revealed to be Fou, a dog-like creature that has journeyed alongside Fujimaru and their party through the entirety of the game.\n\nUpon completion of the singularities, Ritsuka Fujimaru is awarded the rank of Cause, by the Mages Association.<ref>{{cite web|title=\u300c\u7d42\u5c40\u7279\u7570\u70b9 \u51a0\u4f4d\u6642\u9593\u795e\u6bbf \u30bd\u30ed\u30e2\u30f3\u300d\u958b\u5e55\uff01\uff5cFate/Grand Order \u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8|url=https://news.fate-go.jp/2016/uuzjp2/|website=Fate/Grand Order \u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8|access-date=11 February 2019|language=Japanese|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180625153107/http://news.fate-go.jp/2016/uuzjp2/|archive-date= 25 June 2018|df=}}</ref>  In the aftermath of the singularity crisis Chaldea would be tasked with handling Singularity Subspecies. During this time period Chaldea would come under fire from various organizations including the U.N. and the Mages Association.\n\nFollowing the completion of these incidents, Chaldea would find itself under new management under Goredolf Musik. It turned out that Goredolf was just a scapegoat in a hostile takeover by a mysterious organization, conspiring with an unknown entity known as the Foreign God, to destroy Chaldea and the current human history, reverting the planet back to the Age of Gods. Now on the run, Ritsuka, Mash and the surviving members of Chaldea survived aboard the autonomous vessel ''Shadow Border''. The group now travels to different timelines called \"Lostbelts\", timelines separate from the main human history represented by a Crypter and a King, in order to correct human history once again and defeat the Foreign God. For Ritsuka Fujimaru, he must make some grave decisions and sacrifices that either will make him a savior.....or a destroyer.\n\n==Development and release==\nThe game was first drafted by [[Kinoko Nasu]] under the working title \"Fate Online Project Reboot\",<ref>{{Cite web |date=2014-07-27 |url=http://dengekionline.com/elem/000/000/889/889927/ |title=\u300eFate\u300f\u65b0\u4f5c\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300e\u30d5\u30a7\u30a4\u30c8/\u30b0\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u30aa\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u300f\u767a\u8868\uff01 \u30ad\u30fc\u30d3\u30b8\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u306b\u306f\u30bb\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u3084\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30cc\u30fb\u30c0\u30eb\u30af\u306e\u59ff\u3082 |accessdate=2016-11-05 |publisher=\u96fb\u6483App}}</ref> which was meant to be a [[Massive Multiplayer Online]] game using designs drafts and concepts later collected in the ''Fate/complete material IV Extra material'' book. But the planned game was cancelled and shelved during planning stages. It later became a novel, ''[[Fate/Apocrypha]]'', which integrated some concepts of the planned game. Later on in 2014, Aniplex proposed Nasu to revisit the cancelled game project, announcing a collaboration with the game studio DelightWorks to rework the concept into a Mobile RPG game.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2014-10-10 |url=https://app.famitsu.com/20141010_449371/ |title=\u671f\u5f85\u9ad8\u307e\u308b\u300eFate/Grand Order\u300f\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u5948\u9808\u3001\u6b66\u5185\u4e21\u6c0f\u3089\u958b\u767a\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u3092\u5b9f\u65bd |accessdate=2018-04-07 |publisher=\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u901aApp}}</ref>\n\nThe game was published by Aniplex and was released in Japan on July 29, 2015, on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices, with a subsequent release on August 12 for [[iOS]] devices. Aside from its gameplay and own storyline, the game also features events for players to obtain new items and servants, such as summoning campaigns for limited Servants/Craft Essences, specific Servant-based events, real-world annual events, and collaborations with other Type-Moon works such as ''[[Kara no Kyoukai]]'' and ''[[Fate/Zero]]''.\n\nOn January 1, 2017, a sub-sequel to the main storyline was announced with the same title containing a subtitle named \"Epic of Remnant\". On April 16, 2017, Aniplex of America announced ''Fate/Grand Order'' would be released in the United States with a Summer 2017 release window. Director and Creative Producer Yosuke Shiokawa explained that while the game was intended to be released only in Japan, the team took notice of the large amount of overseas players accessing the game and made a decision to make it accessible to other regions as well.  Since the game's release to North American servers, it has followed behind Japanese servers by almost exactly 2 years, the same gap between launches in the two regions.<ref name=\"tonointerview\" />\n\nOn December 26, 2017, the official website and the [[Twitter]] page of the game teased the game's sequel by changing it into a \"hijacked account and site\". The sequel's subtitle, \"Cosmos in the Lostbelt\", was announced on January 1, 2018. The sequel was officially released as an expansion to the main game on the Japanese server starting in Spring 2018. As of April 19, 2018, the North American server is officially accessible in Singapore, Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam and Australia.\n\n== Commercial reception ==\nIn 2018, ''Fate/Grand Order'' drew widespread media attention due to reports of a 31-year old Japanese man identified only as Daigo, claiming to have spent $70,000 to purchase the game's currency, called Saint Quartz, which is used to summon Servants. Daigo kept on spending cash in-game in his desire to get high-level characters and ended up spending more to strengthen them once they were acquired.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://technology.inquirer.net/73746/japanese-man-spends-p3-6-million-on-a-mobile-game-with-no-regrets|title=Japanese man spends P3.6M on mobile game, with no regrets|last=Bayle|first=Alfred|date=March 18, 2018|work=Inquirer.net|access-date=2018-06-01}}</ref> In an interview, the gamer said, \u201cSome people spend $18 on a movie and feel moved.

The player takes the role of \"Master\" and commands a group of individuals called \"Servants\", who are typically historical, literary, and mythological figures from various cultures. The player commands a party composed of up to 6 Servants in each battle, 3 active members and 3 reserve members. In each turn, the player is given a set of 5 Command Cards and may use up to 3 of them in a turn to attack. Each Servant has 5 cards the player may use; the cards for all the Servants on the field are shuffled and dealt to the player each turn. The cards have three types: Buster (a heavy attack), Arts (a medium attack that charges a gauge for the Servant's \"Noble Phantasm\"), and Quick (a light attack that generates Critical Stars that increase the probability of critical hits next turn). If three similar cards are used in one turn, they create a \"Chain\" which gives a bonus based on the cards' properties. If three cards all corresponding to the same servant are selected, then a \"Brave Chain\" will ensue, resulting in an extra, more powerful, attack being added onto the end. Each Servant also has skills that can be used before drawing Command Cards; each skill gives effects in the battle, as well as a special command card called \"Noble Phantasm\" that appears when the gauge is full. The \"Master\" also has a separate set of skills and special abilities called \"Command Spells.\" Command Spells have a variety of effects and recharge based on real-world time.\n\nServants are obtained via a [[gacha game|gacha]] mechanic.  Saint Quartz, an in-game currency earned both by playing the game and via real money [[In-app purchasing|in-app purchases]], is used to summon new Servants and acquire \"Craft Essences\" which give additional effects when equipped to a servant.  This summoning is random, with some servants available commonly, and others rarely.  Another currency is \"Friend Points\", which are more easily acquired, but only can acquire common Servants with them.  If multiple copies of the same Servant are acquired, that servant's power is slightly increased. \n==Plot==\n{{see also|List of Fate/Grand Order characters}}\n\nIn 2015, the Chaldea Security Organization draws on experts of both the magical and mundane fields to observe the future of mankind for possible extinction events. Humanity's survival seems assured for the next century\u2014until the verdict suddenly changes, and now eradication of the species awaits at the end of 2016. The cause is unknown, but appears to be linked with the Japanese town of Fuyuki and the events of 2004 during the Fifth Holy Grail War.\n\nIn response, Chaldea harnesses an experimental means of time travel, the Rayshift technology. With it, Ritsuka Fujimaru (a young man or woman, depending on the player's choice of gender) was newly recruited to the organization, and a mysterious girl named Mash Kyrielight, can travel back to 2004 and discover how to save humanity. A grand order to fight fate has been declared\u2014an order to change the past and restore the future.<ref>{{cite web|title=\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\uff5cFate/Grand Order \u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8|url=http://www.fate-go.jp/world/story.html|website=Fate/Grand Order \u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8|access-date=1 December 2016|language=Japanese|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201214933/http://www.fate-go.jp/world/story.html|archive-date=1 December 2016|df=}}</ref> Following the events in Fuyuki, Ritsuka Fujimaru and Mash Kyrielight must restore the Foundation of Humanity by retrieving powerful Holy Grails. The Grails, which are capable of granting any wish, are also able to sustain abnormalities that threaten humanity's existence. The protagonists utilize Rayshift technology to travel back in time to said periods, ranging from Orleans to Okeanos and even the ancient civilization of Babylonia. Along the way, Ritsuka encounters the main antagonist and mastermind behind the plan to eradicate humanity: the Mage-King Solomon. He proclaims that Chaldea's attempt to save humanity will not matter if they fail to obtain every single Holy Grail, before leaving. After obtaining all 7 Holy Grails, Fujimaru and their Servant advance into Ars Paulina, the throne where Solomon once sat. In the final battle against Solomon and his legion of 72 Demon Gods, both Ritsuka and Mash are unable to defeat any of the Demon Pillars as they regenerate immediately. When all hope seems lost, the Servants that assisted Fujimaru on their quest through every singularity appear, allowing Chaldea to break through and defeat Solomon, who is revealed to be the Demon God Goetia, a beast that possessed Solomon's corpse and wishes to eradicate humanity in order to travel back to the dawn of humankind. Goetia is swiftly dispatched, but not before Mash utilizes her Noble Phantasm to deflect Goetia's Noble Phantasm to protect Fujimaru in exchange for her life. Just as hope was lost, Romani appeared and revealed that he himself is actually the real Solomon, the Grand Caster who wished to be human after the fifth holy grail war. Using his only Noble Phantasm to erase himself from existence and weaken Goetia, he then said his goodbyes to Ritsuka and in order for him to defeat Goetia once and for all. Upon the final Singularity being restored to order, Mash is revived via the power of Beast IV, who is revealed to be Fou, a dog-like creature that has journeyed alongside Fujimaru and their party through the entirety of the game.\n\nUpon completion of the singularities, Ritsuka Fujimaru is awarded the rank of Cause, by the Mages Association.<ref>{{cite web|title=\u300c\u7d42\u5c40\u7279\u7570\u70b9 \u51a0\u4f4d\u6642\u9593\u795e\u6bbf \u30bd\u30ed\u30e2\u30f3\u300d\u958b\u5e55\uff01\uff5cFate/Grand Order \u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8|url=https://news.fate-go.jp/2016/uuzjp2/|website=Fate/Grand Order \u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8|access-date=11 February 2019|language=Japanese|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180625153107/http://news.fate-go.jp/2016/uuzjp2/|archive-date= 25 June 2018|df=}}</ref>  In the aftermath of the singularity crisis Chaldea would be tasked with handling Singularity Subspecies. During this time period Chaldea would come under fire from various organizations including the U.N. and the Mages Association.\n\nFollowing the completion of these incidents, Chaldea would find itself under new management under Goredolf Musik. It turned out that Goredolf was just a scapegoat in a hostile takeover by a mysterious organization, conspiring with an unknown entity known as the Foreign God, to destroy Chaldea and the current human history, reverting the planet back to the Age of Gods. Now on the run, Ritsuka, Mash and the surviving members of Chaldea survived aboard the autonomous vessel ''Shadow Border''. The group now travels to different timelines called \"Lostbelts\", timelines separate from the main human history represented by a Crypter and a King, in order to correct human history once again and defeat the Foreign God.

Later on in 2014, Aniplex proposed Nasu to revisit the cancelled game project, announcing a collaboration with the game studio DelightWorks to rework the concept into a Mobile RPG game.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2014-10-10 |url=https://app.famitsu.com/20141010_449371/ |title=\u671f\u5f85\u9ad8\u307e\u308b\u300eFate/Grand Order\u300f\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u5948\u9808\u3001\u6b66\u5185\u4e21\u6c0f\u3089\u958b\u767a\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u3092\u5b9f\u65bd |accessdate=2018-04-07 |publisher=\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u901aApp}}</ref>\n\nThe game was published by Aniplex and was released in Japan on July 29, 2015, on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices, with a subsequent release on August 12 for [[iOS]] devices. Aside from its gameplay and own storyline, the game also features events for players to obtain new items and servants, such as summoning campaigns for limited Servants/Craft Essences, specific Servant-based events, real-world annual events, and collaborations with other Type-Moon works such as ''[[Kara no Kyoukai]]'' and ''[[Fate/Zero]]''.\n\nOn January 1, 2017, a sub-sequel to the main storyline was announced with the same title containing a subtitle named \"Epic of Remnant\". On April 16, 2017, Aniplex of America announced ''Fate/Grand Order'' would be released in the United States with a Summer 2017 release window. Director and Creative Producer Yosuke Shiokawa explained that while the game was intended to be released only in Japan, the team took notice of the large amount of overseas players accessing the game and made a decision to make it accessible to other regions as well.  Since the game's release to North American servers, it has followed behind Japanese servers by almost exactly 2 years, the same gap between launches in the two regions.<ref name=\"tonointerview\" />\n\nOn December 26, 2017, the official website and the [[Twitter]] page of the game teased the game's sequel by changing it into a \"hijacked account and site\". The sequel's subtitle, \"Cosmos in the Lostbelt\", was announced on January 1, 2018. The sequel was officially released as an expansion to the main game on the Japanese server starting in Spring 2018. As of April 19, 2018, the North American server is officially accessible in Singapore, Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam and Australia.\n\n== Commercial reception ==\nIn 2018, ''Fate/Grand Order'' drew widespread media attention due to reports of a 31-year old Japanese man identified only as Daigo, claiming to have spent $70,000 to purchase the game's currency, called Saint Quartz, which is used to summon Servants. Daigo kept on spending cash in-game in his desire to get high-level characters and ended up spending more to strengthen them once they were acquired.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://technology.inquirer.net/73746/japanese-man-spends-p3-6-million-on-a-mobile-game-with-no-regrets|title=Japanese man spends P3.6M on mobile game, with no regrets|last=Bayle|first=Alfred|date=March 18, 2018|work=Inquirer.net|access-date=2018-06-01}}</ref> In an interview, the gamer said, \u201cSome people spend $18 on a movie and feel moved.

The station and freight depot are listed as contributing properties on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] [[East Wilson Street Historic District]].

However, the drive stalled after a [[Leonard Floyd]] sack. Philadelphia settled for a 44-yard field goal, taking the lead, 3\u20130. After an exchange of punts, Eagles quarterback [[Nick Foles]] launched a 40-yard pass to former Bear [[Alshon Jeffery]]. However, the drive was cut short when [[Roquan Smith]] picked off Foles at Chicago's 35-yard line. The Bears drove down the field and kicked a field goal to tie the game 3\u20133. The Eagles put together another strong drive, featuring 28-yard pass to [[Golden Tate]]. However, this drive was also stopped when Foles' pass was intercepted by [[Adrian Amos]] in the end zone. After punts by both teams, Chicago put together a 13 play, 78-yard drive that resulted in a 29-yard [[Cody Parkey]] field goal to give the Bears a 6\u20133 halftime lead.\n\n=== Second half===\nThe Eagles finally had some success on offense in the second half, capping an 83-yard drive with a 10-yard touchdown pass from Foles to tight end [[Dallas Goedert]]. After punts by both teams, Bears quarterback [[Mitchell Trubisky]] completed a 45-yard pass to [[Allen Robinson]], which set up a 34-yard field goal by Parkey, cutting the Eagles' lead to 10\u20139. In Chicago's following drive, Trubisky completed passes of 19 and 34-yards to [[Taylor Gabriel]] and [[Joshua Bellamy]], respectively. He finishes off the drive with a 22-yard touchdown pass to Robinson to make the score 15\u201310. The Bears attempted a [[two-point conversion]], but failed.  After another exchange of punts, the Eagles drove all the way down to Chicago's 2-yard line. After two runs by [[Darren Sproles]] for no gain and an incomplete pass, Philadelphia faced a 4th and goal 1:01 left in the fourth quarter. Foles passed to Tate for the touchdown. The Eagles went for two but failed. On the Bears next drive, Trubisky completed passes of 25 and 8 yards, both to Robinson, and spiked the ball with 0:10 left in the game.<ref name=espn>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/playbyplay?gameId=401038954|title=All Drives|last=|first=|date=|website=ESPN|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== The play==\nAfter Trubisky's spike, the Bears set up for a 43-yard field goal. However, immediately prior to the snap, Eagles head coach [[Doug Pederson]] called a time-out to [[Icing the kicker|ice the kicker]]. Even though whistles were blown to signify the timeout, Parkey attempted the kick and made it, although it didn't count.

However, the drive stalled after a [[Leonard Floyd]] sack. Philadelphia settled for a 44-yard field goal, taking the lead, 3\u20130. After an exchange of punts, Eagles quarterback [[Nick Foles]] launched a 40-yard pass to former Bear [[Alshon Jeffery]]. However, the drive was cut short when [[Roquan Smith]] picked off Foles at Chicago's 35-yard line. The Bears drove down the field and kicked a field goal to tie the game 3\u20133. The Eagles put together another strong drive, featuring 28-yard pass to [[Golden Tate]]. However, this drive was also stopped when Foles' pass was intercepted by [[Adrian Amos]] in the end zone. After punts by both teams, Chicago put together a 13 play, 78-yard drive that resulted in a 29-yard [[Cody Parkey]] field goal to give the Bears a 6\u20133 halftime lead.\n\n=== Second half===\nThe Eagles finally had some success on offense in the second half, capping an 83-yard drive with a 10-yard touchdown pass from Foles to tight end [[Dallas Goedert]]. After punts by both teams, Bears quarterback [[Mitchell Trubisky]] completed a 45-yard pass to [[Allen Robinson]], which set up a 34-yard field goal by Parkey, cutting the Eagles' lead to 10\u20139. In Chicago's following drive, Trubisky completed passes of 19 and 34-yards to [[Taylor Gabriel]] and [[Joshua Bellamy]], respectively. He finishes off the drive with a 22-yard touchdown pass to Robinson to make the score 15\u201310. The Bears attempted a [[two-point conversion]], but failed.  After another exchange of punts, the Eagles drove all the way down to Chicago's 2-yard line. After two runs by [[Darren Sproles]] for no gain and an incomplete pass, Philadelphia faced a 4th and goal 1:01 left in the fourth quarter. Foles passed to Tate for the touchdown. The Eagles went for two but failed. On the Bears next drive, Trubisky completed passes of 25 and 8 yards, both to Robinson, and spiked the ball with 0:10 left in the game.<ref name=espn>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/playbyplay?gameId=401038954|title=All Drives|last=|first=|date=|website=ESPN|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== The play==\nAfter Trubisky's spike, the Bears set up for a 43-yard field goal. However, immediately prior to the snap, Eagles head coach [[Doug Pederson]] called a time-out to [[Icing the kicker|ice the kicker]]. Even though whistles were blown to signify the timeout, Parkey attempted the kick and made it, although it didn't count.

He is generally regarded as one of the country's greatest ever players. He was born, educated and started his career in [[Fife]], but his peak playing years were in the early 1960s with the [[Glasgow]] club [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], whom he helped to win ten trophies between 1960 and 1965, and where he became known as \"Slim Jim\". However, he started drinking heavily during a four-month layoff caused by a leg fracture in December 1964, his fitness suffered, and he was [[Transfer (football)|transferred]] to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in summer 1965. In two and a half years at Sunderland he played 98 games and scored 12 goals, becoming known for drinking himself unconscious the night before a match and playing well the next day. At the end of 1967 Sunderland transferred him to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], who gave him a [[Free transfer (football)|free transfer]] back to Rangers in 1969 after 50 games. After a further year with Rangers Baxter retired from football in 1970, at the age of 31.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1967, he was a leading member of a strong Scottish international team that lost only once to [[England national football team|England]], in 1965, shortly after he recovered from the leg fracture. He thought his best international performance was a 2\u20131 win against England in 1963, when he scored both goals after Scotland were reduced to 10 players. In the 1967 match against England, who had won the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]], he taunted the opposition by ball juggling while waiting for his teammates to find good positions. Although he was given most of the credit for the 3\u20132 win, some commentators wished he had made an effort to run up a bigger score.\n\nIn his prime, Baxter was known for his ability to raise a team's morale, his good tactical vision, precise passing and ability to send opponents the wrong way \u2013 and for being a joker on the pitch. He also broke with Glasgow tradition by becoming friendly with several members of their major [[Old Firm|Glasgow rivals]], [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]].\n\nAlthough he gained a reputation as a womaniser when he moved to Glasgow, he married in 1965 and had two sons. The marriage broke up in 1981, and in 1983 he formed another relationship that lasted the rest of his life. After retiring from football he became manager of a [[Public house|pub]], and his continued heavy drinking damaged his liver so badly that he needed two [[Organ transplant|transplant]]s at the age of 55, after which he swore off [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]. Baxter was also addicted to gambling, and is estimated to have lost between \u00a3250,000 and \u00a3500,000. After he died of [[pancreatic cancer]] in 2001, his funeral was held in [[Glasgow Cathedral]] and his ashes were buried at Rangers' [[Ibrox Stadium]]. In 2003, a statue was erected in his honour at his hometown, [[Hill of Beath]].\n\n==Early life==\nBaxter was born in [[Hill of Beath]], [[Fife]], on 29 September 1939 and was educated and started his career there. After leaving school he spent eight months as an apprentice [[Cabinet making|cabinet maker]], and then worked as a coal miner.<ref name=\"GuardianObit\" />\n\nHis former headmaster James Carmichael took an interest in ex-pupils and encouraged Baxter to join local football team Halbeath Juveniles instead of one of the glamour clubs.<ref name=\"IndependentObit\" /> Baxter went on to play for the Fife junior team, [[Crossgates Primrose J.F.C.|Crossgates Primrose]].<ref name=\"GuardianObit\" />\n\n==Club career==\n===Raith Rovers===\nBaxter joined [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]] as a part-timer in 1957.<ref name=\"GuardianObit\" /> In his time at Raith he orchestrated a 3-2 win over Rangers at Ibrox. [[Scot Symon]] decided he wanted to sign him for Rangers from that performance.\n\nIn an interview on his career, Baxter was asked if joining the senior ranks was the beginning of his football education. He said he found the idea of being given any sort of football education laughable,  before then commenting on [[Willie McNaught]]. Describing McNaught as, 'a smashing guy', Baxter explained how instead of thoughtlessly charging forward with the ball, McNaught suggested more considered football \u2013 change from running 30 yards to produce a five-yard pass to running five yards and producing a 30-yard pass. This, Baxter then stated, was his football education with Willie McNaught the provider.<ref name = \"qoswillie\">{{cite web |url=http://www.qosfc.com/new_newsview.aspx?newsid=1215 |title=Willie McNaught (and Ken) |work=Queen of the South official website |date=26 April 2012 |accessdate=11 October 2017}}</ref> He later said of his time with the two Fife clubs, \"I would never have made it in today's circumstances. I needed bastards like Carmichael, Buckard, Ferrier, [[Bert Herdman|Herdman]] and McNaught. Young players like I was would simply tell them to get stuffed and take their talent elsewhere.

He is generally regarded as one of the country's greatest ever players. He was born, educated and started his career in [[Fife]], but his peak playing years were in the early 1960s with the [[Glasgow]] club [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], whom he helped to win ten trophies between 1960 and 1965, and where he became known as \"Slim Jim\". However, he started drinking heavily during a four-month layoff caused by a leg fracture in December 1964, his fitness suffered, and he was [[Transfer (football)|transferred]] to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in summer 1965. In two and a half years at Sunderland he played 98 games and scored 12 goals, becoming known for drinking himself unconscious the night before a match and playing well the next day. At the end of 1967 Sunderland transferred him to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], who gave him a [[Free transfer (football)|free transfer]] back to Rangers in 1969 after 50 games. After a further year with Rangers Baxter retired from football in 1970, at the age of 31.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1967, he was a leading member of a strong Scottish international team that lost only once to [[England national football team|England]], in 1965, shortly after he recovered from the leg fracture. He thought his best international performance was a 2\u20131 win against England in 1963, when he scored both goals after Scotland were reduced to 10 players. In the 1967 match against England, who had won the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]], he taunted the opposition by ball juggling while waiting for his teammates to find good positions. Although he was given most of the credit for the 3\u20132 win, some commentators wished he had made an effort to run up a bigger score.\n\nIn his prime, Baxter was known for his ability to raise a team's morale, his good tactical vision, precise passing and ability to send opponents the wrong way \u2013 and for being a joker on the pitch. He also broke with Glasgow tradition by becoming friendly with several members of their major [[Old Firm|Glasgow rivals]], [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]].\n\nAlthough he gained a reputation as a womaniser when he moved to Glasgow, he married in 1965 and had two sons. The marriage broke up in 1981, and in 1983 he formed another relationship that lasted the rest of his life. After retiring from football he became manager of a [[Public house|pub]], and his continued heavy drinking damaged his liver so badly that he needed two [[Organ transplant|transplant]]s at the age of 55, after which he swore off [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]. Baxter was also addicted to gambling, and is estimated to have lost between \u00a3250,000 and \u00a3500,000. After he died of [[pancreatic cancer]] in 2001, his funeral was held in [[Glasgow Cathedral]] and his ashes were buried at Rangers' [[Ibrox Stadium]]. In 2003, a statue was erected in his honour at his hometown, [[Hill of Beath]].\n\n==Early life==\nBaxter was born in [[Hill of Beath]], [[Fife]], on 29 September 1939 and was educated and started his career there. After leaving school he spent eight months as an apprentice [[Cabinet making|cabinet maker]], and then worked as a coal miner.<ref name=\"GuardianObit\" />\n\nHis former headmaster James Carmichael took an interest in ex-pupils and encouraged Baxter to join local football team Halbeath Juveniles instead of one of the glamour clubs.<ref name=\"IndependentObit\" /> Baxter went on to play for the Fife junior team, [[Crossgates Primrose J.F.C.|Crossgates Primrose]].<ref name=\"GuardianObit\" />\n\n==Club career==\n===Raith Rovers===\nBaxter joined [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]] as a part-timer in 1957.<ref name=\"GuardianObit\" /> In his time at Raith he orchestrated a 3-2 win over Rangers at Ibrox. [[Scot Symon]] decided he wanted to sign him for Rangers from that performance.\n\nIn an interview on his career, Baxter was asked if joining the senior ranks was the beginning of his football education. He said he found the idea of being given any sort of football education laughable,  before then commenting on [[Willie McNaught]]. Describing McNaught as, 'a smashing guy', Baxter explained how instead of thoughtlessly charging forward with the ball, McNaught suggested more considered football \u2013 change from running 30 yards to produce a five-yard pass to running five yards and producing a 30-yard pass. This, Baxter then stated, was his football education with Willie McNaught the provider.<ref name = \"qoswillie\">{{cite web |url=http://www.qosfc.com/new_newsview.aspx?newsid=1215 |title=Willie McNaught (and Ken) |work=Queen of the South official website |date=26 April 2012 |accessdate=11 October 2017}}</ref> He later said of his time with the two Fife clubs, \"I would never have made it in today's circumstances.

Westing. (Despite its name, Sunset Towers faces east \u2013 into the sunrise.) Sam Westing was a wealthy [[Businessperson|businessman]] who made his fortune in paper products. He was very patriotic and never smoked, drank, or gambled.\n\nAs the story opens, Barney Northrup is selling apartments to a carefully selected group of tenants. He claims that chess is not allowed in the building. After Sam Westing dies, at the beginning of the book, it emerges that most of the tenants are named as heirs in Westing's will. The will is structured like a puzzle, with the 16 heirs challenged to find the solution. Each of the eight pairs, assigned seemingly at random, is given $10,000 cash and a different set of baffling clues. The pair that solves the mystery will inherit Westing's entire $200 million fortune and control of his company. It is discovered that Berthe Erica Crow is the answer but not the murderer. In the end, unknown to the other players, Turtle Wexler wins the game and inherits Sam Westing's company.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Pair One===\n* ''' Jake Wexler''' is a  [[podiatrist]], and a bookie on the side. He is married to Grace Wexler, whom he loves, but he also knows that she might never be happy with their life or financial situation. Jake is the father of Angela Wexler and Turtle Wexler.\n*'''Madame Sun Lin Hoo''' is the second and much-younger Chinese immigrant wife of James Shin Hoo. She barely knows how to speak English. She can usually be found cooking in her husband's restaurant. There is a rumor going around Mr. Hoo married her because of her 100-year-old sauce recipe. Although she is an heir, she doesn't contribute to the game.\n\n===Pair Two===\n* '''Tabitha-Ruth Wexler''', known as '''Turtle''' or \"Alice\" to Flora Baumbach, is a highly intelligent 13-year-old girl. She is very protective of her long, dark braid of hair and anyone who touches it gets a kick to the shin. She excels at playing the stock market. She is very fond of both Sandy McSouthers and her partner Flora Baumbach. She has a sister named Angela Wexler, a mother named Grace Windkloppel Wexler and a father named Jake Wexler. Unknown to all else, she secretly wins the game by discovering the fourth identity of Windy Windkloppel/Sam Westing and is given control of his company. She visits him for chess every Sunday from then until his death at 85. It is discovered that she later marries Theo in the epilogue when Julian Eastman asks about her husband. After she turns 18, she requests that everyone call her \"T.R. Wexler\". She admits to being the bomber after the fourth bomb explodes to protect her sister, Angela.\n* '''Flora Baumbach''' is a shy 60-year-old [[dressmaker]] who becomes a maternal figure to her partner, Turtle. Her daughter, Rosalie, had [[Down syndrome]] and died of [[pneumonia]] at age 19. Her husband disappeared, and it is unknown whether he died or if there was a divorce. Flora is kind to everyone and prefers to see the best in people. Turtle refers to her as \"Baba,\" while she refers to Turtle as \"Alice.\" Flora discovers that she is exceptional at braiding hair when she starts braiding Turtle's hair.\n\n===Pair Three===\n* '''Christos \"Chris\" Theodorakis''' is a 15-year-old boy who uses a wheelchair due to degenerative muscle disease. He is very intelligent and enjoys [[birdwatching]]. His brother, Theo, is very protective of him. Chris's disease causes muscle spasms and affects his speech, but he is much more observant than he lets on \u2013 in part because he is often dismissed by others. Chris also develops a temporary friendship with Sydelle Pulaski. In the epilogue, Denton Deere discovers a medication for Chris that helps with his condition.\n* '''Dr. Denton Deere''' is a 25-year-old [[Internship (medicine)|medical intern]]. He is engaged to Angela. He has an obsession with diagnosing those he meets. He is very stuck up, and Turtle calls him a \u201cknow-it-all stuck up marshmallow face\u201d. He is usually kicked by Turtle. However, he gets better as the book progresses.\n\n===Pair Four===\n* '''Judge J.J. Ford''' is an intelligent and serious African-American woman in her forties. She is suspicious of the game created by Sam Westing. Unlike the other heirs, who want to win the game and the fortune, her goal is to discover the past of every heir. She prefers to work on her own, but uses her partner's ear for gossip to her advantage. Her connection to Westing is that she is the daughter of his former servants. Growing up, Westing would play chess with Ford and funded her education. As Sandy, Westing suggested that he did so as he saw her potential instead of pity as she believes.\n* '''Alexander \"Sandy\" McSouthers''' was a 65-year-old [[Doorman (profession)|doorman]] but is also Sam Westing, Barney Northup, Julian R. Eastman, Windy Windkloppel (as discovered at the end of the story) in Sunset Towers. His description says that he previously worked at Westing Paper Products Corporation and claims to have been fired by Sam Westing himself for attempting to organize the workers. McSouthers is notable for his knowledge of Sunset Towers' [[gossip]]. He is exceptionally close to Turtle Wexler.\n\n===Pair Five===\n* '''Grace Windsor Wexler''', married to Jake Wexler and mother of Angela and Turtle, is a self-centered woman who is obsessed with her own image. She favors Angela while largely ignoring Turtle. She claims to be Mr. Westing's niece; her name is actually Gracie Windkloppel Wexler. Grace wants to be an [[interior design]]er. However, as the game goes on, she develops a growing interest in her partner's restaurant and the restaurant business in general.\n* '''James Shin Hoo''' is a middle-aged man, owner of Shin Hoo's restaurant and former [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]], as well as Madame Hoo's husband and Doug's father. He claims Mr. Westing stole his patent for the disposable diaper and appears bitter and moody for this reason. He suffers from [[ulcer]]s, and he can often be seen yelling at his son to study. He also often complains about how Doug is a \"dumb jock\" and incredibly lazy. Victim of the second bomb.\n\n===Pair Six===\n* '''Berthe Erica Crow''', usually referred to as simply '''Crow,''' is an extremely religious 57-year-old woman. She works as a cleaning woman for Sunset Towers, while also operating a downtown soup kitchen for the homeless. She was the wife of Sam Westing and the answer to the game. Her pressuring led to the death of her and Westing's daughter, Violet because she didn't want to marry the man she was betrothed to. She was accused of being the murderer.\n* '''Otis Amber''' is a 62-year-old \"delivery boy.\" Even outside of the game, he is often seen with Berthe Erica Crow, in part because he assists Berthe with her soup kitchen. At the beginning of the story, he tells the tale of the gruesome bet that a boy once made involving the Westing mansion, which becomes an eerie theme throughout the book, using two words: \"purple waves.\" Near the end, the heirs discover that he was a private investigator hired by Barney Northup to investigate Judge J.J. Ford, George Theodorakis, James Hoo, Grace Windkloppel, Flora Baumbach, and Sybil Pulaski. He is discovered to have married Crow at the end.\n\n===Pair Seven===\n* '''Theo Theodorakis''' is a smart [[Secondary school|high school]] student, and very loyal to his family. He is protective of his brother Chris and works hard in his parents' [[Coffeehouse|coffee shop]]. He is interested in becoming a writer, and also becomes friends with his partner, Doug Hoo. He has a crush on Angela Wexler. However, in the epilogue, he finds Turtle \"attractive\".\n* '''Doug Hoo,''' son of James Shin Hoo, is a high school track star, one of the best mile-runners in the state. Running is his passion, but his father often criticizes him for not studying enough. He is a prankster and develops a rivalry with Turtle Wexler because he often is pulling her braid and posting mocking notes about her, but he is very close to Theo.\n\n===Pair Eight===\n* '''Angela Wexler''' is a beautiful 20-year-old girl: fair, blonde, and very pretty. She is considered the 'perfect' daughter, often getting more attention than her sister Turtle. However, people only acknowledge her as an attractive object to be married to Dr. Denton Deere, and not an intelligent woman in her own right. She is the one who bombs the building, however, her sister takes the blame and tells her to keep the truth to herself. She was a victim of the third bomb.\n* '''Sydelle Pulaski''' is a mysterious character who seems to have no connection to Mr. Westing or the other heirs. No one pays any attention to her, so she tries hard to be noticed. She seems to have an affinity for Chris Theodorakis. She has a crutch and often decorates and paints it to match her outfit. She is clever and observant, although these traits are often looked over. She is secretary to the president of Schultz's Sausages, Conrad Schultz, who later in the book is her fianc\u00e9.\n\n===Other characters===\n* '''Barney Northrup''' is a mysterious figure who sells all of the apartments in Sunset Towers to the various heirs. At the beginning of the book, it is said he is a good businessman. After this, he is rarely seen by any of the tenants. Barney Northrup is also not a real person. (Sam Westing)\n* '''Julian R.

He is Windy Windkloppel's last identity and dies beside Turtle.\n* '''Dr. Sidney Sikes''' is a good friend of Samuel W. Westing and a witness to his will. Was the one who declared both Westing and Sandy McSouthers (Sam Westing) dead and appears to be in on Westing's plan.\n* '''Edgar Jennings Plum'''  or Ed Plum, is the young and fairly incompetent [[lawyer]] in charge of handling Samuel Westing's estate. Aside from reading Westing's will to the players, Plum has no part in the game. He is seen admiring Angela.\n* '''Mr. and Mrs. Theodorakis''' runs the Sunset Towers coffee shop.  They have no role in the game, even though George Theodorakis was Violet Westing's, first love. Their sons Chris and Theo do participate in the game. Victims of the first bomb.\n\n==Epilogue==\nThe epilogue of the story is told in the book's last three chapters, which depict what happened to the heirs after the game ended, and how it affected them.\n\n* '''Otis AmbZDFGHKL;LKJHGFDSZXCVBNM,JHGSASDRTYUIOIUYREWAZXCVBNM,.,MNBVCXer''' and '''Crow''' fall in love and marry, leaving their jobs at Sunset Towers to work at Crow's soup kitchen, to which many of the heirs leave donations.

Retiring from athletics, he becomes a popular sports announcer.\n* '''Chris Theodorakis''' is ultimately able to manage the effects of his disease thanks to Denton's extensive research. However, he remains unable to walk and uses a wheelchair for the rest of his life. His college education is financed by Judge Ford, and he meets a girl named Shirley during his first year. The two later marry and become professors at the local university. Chris discovers and names a new species of parrot (the \"something-Christos parrot\") during an expedition in Central America.\n* '''Sydelle Pulaski''' returns to her old job at Schultz Sausages and discovers that Mr. Schultz has a crush on her. She later marries him. The pair moves to [[Hawaii]], though Sydelle stays in touch with Angela.

Westing. (Despite its name, Sunset Towers faces east \u2013 into the sunrise.) Sam Westing was a wealthy [[Businessperson|businessman]] who made his fortune in paper products. He was very patriotic and never smoked, drank, or gambled.\n\nAs the story opens, Barney Northrup is selling apartments to a carefully selected group of tenants. He claims that chess is not allowed in the building. After Sam Westing dies, at the beginning of the book, it emerges that most of the tenants are named as heirs in Westing's will. The will is structured like a puzzle, with the 16 heirs challenged to find the solution. Each of the eight pairs, assigned seemingly at random, is given $10,000 cash and a different set of baffling clues. The pair that solves the mystery will inherit Westing's entire $200 million fortune and control of his company. It is discovered that Berthe Erica Crow is the answer but not the murderer. In the end, unknown to the other players, Turtle Wexler wins the game and inherits Sam Westing's company.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Pair One===\n* ''' Jake Wexler''' is a  [[podiatrist]], and a bookie on the side. He is married to Grace Wexler, whom he loves, but he also knows that she might never be happy with their life or financial situation. Jake is the father of Angela Wexler and Turtle Wexler.\n*'''Madame Sun Lin Hoo''' is the second and much-younger Chinese immigrant wife of James Shin Hoo. She barely knows how to speak English. She can usually be found cooking in her husband's restaurant. There is a rumor going around Mr. Hoo married her because of her 100-year-old sauce recipe. Although she is an heir, she doesn't contribute to the game.\n\n===Pair Two===\n* '''Tabitha-Ruth Wexler''', known as '''Turtle''' or \"Alice\" to Flora Baumbach, is a highly intelligent 13-year-old girl. She is very protective of her long, dark braid of hair and anyone who touches it gets a kick to the shin. She excels at playing the stock market. She is very fond of both Sandy McSouthers and her partner Flora Baumbach. She has a sister named Angela Wexler, a mother named Grace Windkloppel Wexler and a father named Jake Wexler. Unknown to all else, she secretly wins the game by discovering the fourth identity of Windy Windkloppel/Sam Westing and is given control of his company. She visits him for chess every Sunday from then until his death at 85. It is discovered that she later marries Theo in the epilogue when Julian Eastman asks about her husband. After she turns 18, she requests that everyone call her \"T.R. Wexler\". She admits to being the bomber after the fourth bomb explodes to protect her sister, Angela.\n* '''Flora Baumbach''' is a shy 60-year-old [[dressmaker]] who becomes a maternal figure to her partner, Turtle. Her daughter, Rosalie, had [[Down syndrome]] and died of [[pneumonia]] at age 19. Her husband disappeared, and it is unknown whether he died or if there was a divorce. Flora is kind to everyone and prefers to see the best in people. Turtle refers to her as \"Baba,\" while she refers to Turtle as \"Alice.\" Flora discovers that she is exceptional at braiding hair when she starts braiding Turtle's hair.\n\n===Pair Three===\n* '''Christos \"Chris\" Theodorakis''' is a 15-year-old boy who uses a wheelchair due to degenerative muscle disease. He is very intelligent and enjoys [[birdwatching]]. His brother, Theo, is very protective of him. Chris's disease causes muscle spasms and affects his speech, but he is much more observant than he lets on \u2013 in part because he is often dismissed by others. Chris also develops a temporary friendship with Sydelle Pulaski. In the epilogue, Denton Deere discovers a medication for Chris that helps with his condition.\n* '''Dr. Denton Deere''' is a 25-year-old [[Internship (medicine)|medical intern]]. He is engaged to Angela. He has an obsession with diagnosing those he meets. He is very stuck up, and Turtle calls him a \u201cknow-it-all stuck up marshmallow face\u201d. He is usually kicked by Turtle. However, he gets better as the book progresses.\n\n===Pair Four===\n* '''Judge J.J. Ford''' is an intelligent and serious African-American woman in her forties. She is suspicious of the game created by Sam Westing. Unlike the other heirs, who want to win the game and the fortune, her goal is to discover the past of every heir. She prefers to work on her own, but uses her partner's ear for gossip to her advantage. Her connection to Westing is that she is the daughter of his former servants. Growing up, Westing would play chess with Ford and funded her education. As Sandy, Westing suggested that he did so as he saw her potential instead of pity as she believes.\n* '''Alexander \"Sandy\" McSouthers''' was a 65-year-old [[Doorman (profession)|doorman]] but is also Sam Westing, Barney Northup, Julian R. Eastman, Windy Windkloppel (as discovered at the end of the story) in Sunset Towers. His description says that he previously worked at Westing Paper Products Corporation and claims to have been fired by Sam Westing himself for attempting to organize the workers. McSouthers is notable for his knowledge of Sunset Towers' [[gossip]]. He is exceptionally close to Turtle Wexler.\n\n===Pair Five===\n* '''Grace Windsor Wexler''', married to Jake Wexler and mother of Angela and Turtle, is a self-centered woman who is obsessed with her own image. She favors Angela while largely ignoring Turtle. She claims to be Mr. Westing's niece; her name is actually Gracie Windkloppel Wexler. Grace wants to be an [[interior design]]er. However, as the game goes on, she develops a growing interest in her partner's restaurant and the restaurant business in general.\n* '''James Shin Hoo''' is a middle-aged man, owner of Shin Hoo's restaurant and former [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]], as well as Madame Hoo's husband and Doug's father. He claims Mr. Westing stole his patent for the disposable diaper and appears bitter and moody for this reason. He suffers from [[ulcer]]s, and he can often be seen yelling at his son to study. He also often complains about how Doug is a \"dumb jock\" and incredibly lazy. Victim of the second bomb.\n\n===Pair Six===\n* '''Berthe Erica Crow''', usually referred to as simply '''Crow,''' is an extremely religious 57-year-old woman. She works as a cleaning woman for Sunset Towers, while also operating a downtown soup kitchen for the homeless. She was the wife of Sam Westing and the answer to the game. Her pressuring led to the death of her and Westing's daughter, Violet because she didn't want to marry the man she was betrothed to. She was accused of being the murderer.\n* '''Otis Amber''' is a 62-year-old \"delivery boy.\" Even outside of the game, he is often seen with Berthe Erica Crow, in part because he assists Berthe with her soup kitchen. At the beginning of the story, he tells the tale of the gruesome bet that a boy once made involving the Westing mansion, which becomes an eerie theme throughout the book, using two words: \"purple waves.\" Near the end, the heirs discover that he was a private investigator hired by Barney Northup to investigate Judge J.J. Ford, George Theodorakis, James Hoo, Grace Windkloppel, Flora Baumbach, and Sybil Pulaski. He is discovered to have married Crow at the end.\n\n===Pair Seven===\n* '''Theo Theodorakis''' is a smart [[Secondary school|high school]] student, and very loyal to his family. He is protective of his brother Chris and works hard in his parents' [[Coffeehouse|coffee shop]]. He is interested in becoming a writer, and also becomes friends with his partner, Doug Hoo. He has a crush on Angela Wexler. However, in the epilogue, he finds Turtle \"attractive\".\n* '''Doug Hoo,''' son of James Shin Hoo, is a high school track star, one of the best mile-runners in the state. Running is his passion, but his father often criticizes him for not studying enough. He is a prankster and develops a rivalry with Turtle Wexler because he often is pulling her braid and posting mocking notes about her, but he is very close to Theo.\n\n===Pair Eight===\n* '''Angela Wexler''' is a beautiful 20-year-old girl: fair, blonde, and very pretty. She is considered the 'perfect' daughter, often getting more attention than her sister Turtle. However, people only acknowledge her as an attractive object to be married to Dr. Denton Deere, and not an intelligent woman in her own right. She is the one who bombs the building, however, her sister takes the blame and tells her to keep the truth to herself. She was a victim of the third bomb.\n* '''Sydelle Pulaski''' is a mysterious character who seems to have no connection to Mr. Westing or the other heirs. No one pays any attention to her, so she tries hard to be noticed. She seems to have an affinity for Chris Theodorakis. She has a crutch and often decorates and paints it to match her outfit. She is clever and observant, although these traits are often looked over. She is secretary to the president of Schultz's Sausages, Conrad Schultz, who later in the book is her fianc\u00e9.\n\n===Other characters===\n* '''Barney Northrup''' is a mysterious figure who sells all of the apartments in Sunset Towers to the various heirs.

They have no role in the game, even though George Theodorakis was Violet Westing's, first love. Their sons Chris and Theo do participate in the game.

Lambu Aatta and Bulla to kill each other. Lambu Aatta kills one of the accomplices of Bulla and initiates the war, later Bulla settles the score by killing Lambu Aatta's brother. Lambu Aatta bounces back by raping and subsequently killing Bulla's sister. Bulla is ultimately able to kill Lambu Aatta and win the war. Now the undisputed leader of the underworld, Bulla is hired by a corrupt politician Bachubhai Bhigona (Deepak Shirke) to murder his rival. Bulla sends his right-hand man Kala Shetty (Rami Reddy) to do the job. Shetty successfully commits the murder in front of several gawking policemen, but as soon as he is able to outrun the police he is caught and turned over to the authorities by Shankar (Mithun Chakraborty). Here we are introduced to the protagonist who works as a coolie in a shipyard, and sometimes at the airport. He lives in relative comfort with his policeman father, his sister, Geeta, and a pet monkey called Tinchu. Shankar also has a girlfriend named Ganga, who wants to marry him as soon as possible, but Shankar has bigger things to worry about.\n\nShankar further enrages Bulla by entering a fighting competition organized by Bulla at the shipyard. Shankar does not enter to win money or fame for himself, but only to win the money so that some other labourer can marry off his daughter. He manages to defeat Bulla's prize fighter, by just twisting his hand for few seconds! The animosity is raised further when Shankar's father is beaten up by Bulla's goons when his father tries to stop the goons from collecting money from shopkeepers. Shankar reaches the scene and beats Bulla's men, who are able to somersault many feet high in air while fighting. However, Shankar beats all of them with relative ease, though during the fight, it is rather clear that Bulla's men were performing stunts deliberately, and came to the venue only to be thrashed by Shankar.\n\nAs revenge, one of Bulla's henchmen, Natte (shortie), abducts Shankar's sister, and tries to molest her. However, she is saved by Gulshan, and she falls in love with Gulshan. But, this turns out to be a scheme by Bulla, as Gulshan marries Geeta and then hands her over to Chuttiya for his pleasure. Bulla gives Chuttiya 'Vitamin Sex' (a likely reference to Viagra), obtained from London, for him to overcome his impotency. However, Geeta dies while being raped by Chuttiya, and he disposes of the body in a jungle. Shankar's monkey, Tinchu sees this and leads Shankar to Bulla's bungalow. Shankar chases Chuttiya to Bulla's doorstep, where he is confronted by Bulla and his henchmen Ibu Hatela (Harish Patel), Pote (Mohan Joshi) and Inspector Kale. Shankar swears revenge on them and then goes his way.\n\nWhen he learns of his daughter's death, Shankar's father goes mad with grief and threatens Inspector Kale who he blames for being a henchman for Bulla the gangster. After a brief struggle the inspector chokes the old man to death. Shankar meets Bulla and his henchmen and promises them that he will kill all of them in 10 days. On his way back, Shankar finds an abandoned baby girl child, and adopts despite his condition.\n\nShankar then goes on a rampage and starts killing all of Bulla's accomplices one by one, starting with Gulshan. Shankar finds Ibu Hatela attempting to rape a girl, and beheads him, too. However, when he tries to assassinate the politician Bachubhai Bhigona, a sniper from another car kills Bhigona. Shankar is caught and charged for the murder, and is sentenced to a life term in prison. Shankar escapes prison the same night, and goes after Inspector Kale. Shankar is then ambushed by several Kung-fu trained goons with knives, submachine guns and grenades. Shankar thrashes them and kills Kale.\n\nAfter this, Shankar goes after Chikna, who is employed by Bulla to lure village girls to the city and then force them into prostitution. Before killing Chikna, Shankar learns that the baby girl he adopted was in fact Bulla's illegitimate child.\n\nWhile Shankar hunts for Pote, Chuttiya and Bulla on the other hand kill his girlfriend Ganga. After killing Pote, Shankar goes to kill Chuttiya. Chuttiya then informs Shankar that he is impotent and it was his elder brother Bulla who gave him vitamin sex which put him into a frenzy and made him violently rape Shankar's sister. Thus, to take revenge, Shankar castrates Chuttiya and says that this is what he deserves.\n\nIn the climactic scene, Bulla and Shankar have a showdown in the shipyard-airport complex. Bulla is backed up by several dozen auto-rickshaws that run helter-skelter and attack Shankar. Shankar takes out a rocket-propelled grenade launcher from the boot of his car and takes down the auto-rickshaws.\n\nThe action quickly switches to a coal mine, where Bulla tries to use the adopted baby which he thinks is Shankar's daughter to gain leverage in the fight. Soon Bulla realizes that the baby is his own, he still uses the baby as a shield. Shankar rescues the girl with the help of his monkey, Tinchu. Again the scene switches to airport where Kala Shetty comes with a helicopter to save Bulla. With a brief fight Shankar kills Kala Shetty and finally Bulla.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mithun Chakraborty]] as Shankar\n* [[Mukesh Rishi]] as Bulla\n* Ishrat Ali as Lambu Atta\n* [[Shakti Kapoor]] as Chuttiya\n* [[Razak Khan]] as Lucky Chikna\n* [[Rami Reddy (actor)|Rami Reddy]] as Kala Shetty\n* [[Harish Patel]] as Ibu Hatela\n* [[Mohan Joshi]] as Pote\n* [[Deepak Shirke]] as Bachubhai Bhigona\n* Varna Raj as Ganga\n* Gulshan Rana as Gulshan\n* Vinod Tripathi as Kundan\n* [[Sapna (actress)|Sapna]] as Geeta\n\n==Soundtrack==\n#\"Tum Bin Jeena Raas Na Aaye\" - [[Sadhana Sargam]], [[Udit Narayan]]\n#\"Nasha Nasha Karta Hai\" - [[Anand Raj Anand]], Poonam Bhatia\n#\"Aaj Parayi Hokar Behna Jaye\" - [[Mohammed Aziz]]\n#\"Kholi Mere Dil Ki Khali Hai Tu\" - Poonam Bhatia, [[Abhijeet Bhattacharya]]\n#\"Teri Aankhon Ka Chal Gaya Jadu\" - [[Kavita Krishnamurthy]], [[Kumar Sanu]]\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Reviews===\nRavi Balakrishnan of ''[[The Economic Times]]'' states \"The Mithun Chakarborthy-starrer has gained a surprising amount of cult popularity over the last year and a half or so, with several adulatory reviews and even fan-sites cropping up.

The narrative revolves around a coolie who vows to exact revenge upon a crime lord and his cronies after they kill his loved ones.\n\nThe film was released on 4 September 1998. Over time, the film has gained a [[cult following]], selling over 2,000 [[VCD]] copies at a single outlet.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/business-of-bollywood/an-a-of-the-b-grade/articleshow/2309167.cms|title=An A of the B-grade|website=[[The Economic Times]]}}</ref> It also received a limited re-release in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.asianage.com/entertainment/bollywood/190118/gundas-new-run-on-the-big-screen.html|title=Gunda\u2019s new run on the big screen|website=[[The Asian Age]]}}</ref> The same year, actor [[Deepak Shirke]] who played politician Bachubhai, revealed that the film was shot without a script.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cinestaan.com/articles/2018/sep/4/15402/20-years-of-gunda-deepak-shirke-recalls-shooting-without-a-script|title=20 years of Gunda: Deepak Shirke recalls shooting without a script|website=Cinestaan}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens with a scene where two corrupt politicians hire two different crime lords viz. Lambu Aatta and Bulla to kill each other. Lambu Aatta kills one of the accomplices of Bulla and initiates the war, later Bulla settles the score by killing Lambu Aatta's brother. Lambu Aatta bounces back by raping and subsequently killing Bulla's sister. Bulla is ultimately able to kill Lambu Aatta and win the war. Now the undisputed leader of the underworld, Bulla is hired by a corrupt politician Bachubhai Bhigona (Deepak Shirke) to murder his rival. Bulla sends his right-hand man Kala Shetty (Rami Reddy) to do the job. Shetty successfully commits the murder in front of several gawking policemen, but as soon as he is able to outrun the police he is caught and turned over to the authorities by Shankar (Mithun Chakraborty). Here we are introduced to the protagonist who works as a coolie in a shipyard, and sometimes at the airport. He lives in relative comfort with his policeman father, his sister, Geeta, and a pet monkey called Tinchu. Shankar also has a girlfriend named Ganga, who wants to get married to him as soon as possible, but Shankar has bigger things to worry about.\n\nShankar further enrages Bulla by entering a fighting competition organized by Bulla at the shipyard. Shankar does not enter to win money or fame for himself, but only to win the money so that some other labourer can marry off his daughter. He manages to defeat Bulla's prize fighter, by just twisting his hand for few seconds! The animosity is raised further when Shankar's father is beaten up by Bulla's goons when his father tries to stop the goons from collecting money from shopkeepers. Shankar reaches the scene and beats Bulla's men, who are able to somersault many feet high in air while fighting. However, Shankar beats all of them with relative ease, though during the fight, it is rather clear that Bulla's men were performing stunts deliberately, and came to the venue only to be thrashed by Shankar.\n\nAs revenge, one of Bulla's henchmen, Natte (shortie), abducts Shankar's sister, and tries to molest her. However, she is saved by Gulshan, and she falls in love with Gulshan. But, this turns out to be a scheme by Bulla, as Gulshan marries Geeta and then hands her over to Chuttiya for his pleasure. Bulla gives Chuttiya 'Vitamin Sex' (a likely reference to Viagra), obtained from London, for him to overcome his impotency. However, Geeta dies while being raped by Chuttiya, and he disposes of the body in a jungle. Shankar's monkey, Tinchu sees this and leads Shankar to Bulla's bungalow. Shankar chases Chuttiya to Bulla's doorstep, where he is confronted by Bulla and his henchmen Ibu Hatela (Harish Patel), Pote (Mohan Joshi) and Inspector Kale. Shankar swears revenge on them and then goes his way.\n\nWhen he learns of his daughter's death, Shankar's father goes mad with grief and threatens Inspector Kale who he blames for being a henchman for Bulla the gangster. After a brief struggle the inspector chokes the old man to death. Shankar meets Bulla and his henchmen and promises them that he will kill all of them in 10 days. On his way back, Shankar finds an abandoned baby girl child, and adopts despite his condition.\n\nShankar then goes on a rampage and starts killing all of Bulla's accomplices one by one, starting with Gulshan. Shankar finds Ibu Hatela attempting to rape a girl, and beheads him too. However, when he tries to assassinate the politician Bachubhai Bhigona, a sniper from another car kills Bhigona. Shankar is caught and charged for the murder, and is sentenced to a life term in prison. Shankar escapes prison the same night, and goes after Inspector Kale. Shankar is then ambushed by several Kung-fu trained goons with knives, submachine guns and grenades. Shankar thrashes them and kills Kale.\n\nAfter this, Shankar goes after Chikna, who is employed by Bulla to lure village girls to the city and then force them into prostitution. Before killing Chikna, Shankar learns that the baby girl he adopted was in fact Bulla's illegitimate child.\n\nWhile Shankar hunts for Pote, Chuttiya and Bulla on the other hand kill his girlfriend Ganga. After killing Pote, Shankar goes to kill Chuttiya. Chuttiya then informs Shankar that he is impotent & it was his elder brother Bulla who gave him vitamin sex which put him into a frenzy & made him violently rape Shankar's sister. Thus, to take revenge, Shankar castrates Chuttiya & says that this is what he deserves.\n\nIn the climactic scene, Bulla and Shankar have a showdown in the shipyard-airport complex.

CI bypasses the normal acoustic hearing process to replace it with electric signals which directly stimulate the auditory nerve. A person with a cochlear implant receiving intensive auditory training may learn to interpret those signals as sound and speech. However, one third of deaf children do not develop language if they are on a CI program alone and have no sign language input.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVIwR7YtVyA]\n\nThe implant has two main components. The outside component is generally worn behind the ear, but could also be attached to clothing, for example, in young children. This component, the sound processor, contains microphones, electronics that include [[Digital Signal Processor]] chips, battery, and a coil which transmits a signal to the implant across the skin.  The inside component, the actual implant, has a coil to receive signals, electronics, and an array of electrodes which is placed into the [[cochlea]], which stimulate the [[cochlear nerve]].\n\nThe surgical procedure is performed under [[general anesthesia]]. Surgical risks are minimal but can include tinnitus, facial nerve bruising and dizziness.\n\nFrom the early days of implants in the 1970's and the 1980's, speech perception via an implant has steadily increased. Many users of modern implants gain reasonable to good hearing and speech perception skills post-implantation, especially when combined with lipreading.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Graeme M. |title=The Multi-Channel Cochlear Implant: Multi-Disciplinary Development of Electrical Stimulation of the Cochlea and the Resulting Clinical Benefit |journal=Hearing Research |date=April 2015 |volume=322 |pages=4\u201313 |doi=10.1016/j.heares.2014.08.002|pmid=25159273 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Shannon |first1=Robert V. |title=Advances in Auditory Prostheses |journal=Current Opinion in Neurology |date=February 2012 |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=61\u201366 |doi=10.1097/WCO.0b013e32834ef878|pmid=22157109 |pmc=4123811 }}</ref> However, for pre-lingually deaf children the risk of not acquiring spoken language even with an implant may be as high as 30%.[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0142723719834102] One of the challenges that remain with these implants is that hearing and speech understanding skills after implantation show a wide range of variation across individual implant users. Factors such as duration and cause of hearing loss, how the implant is situated in the cochlea, the overall health of the cochlear nerve, but also individual capabilities of re-learning are considered to contribute to this variation, yet no certain predictive factors are known.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blamey |first1=Peter |last2=Artieres |first2=Fran\u00e7oise |last3=Ba\u015fkent |first3=Deniz |last4=Bergeron |first4=Fran\u00e7ois |last5=Beynon |first5=Andy |last6=Burke |first6=Elaine |last7=Dillier |first7=Norbert |last8=Dowell |first8=Richard |last9=Fraysse |first9=Bernard |last10=Gall\u00e9go |first10=St\u00e9phane |last11=Govaerts |first11=Paul J. |last12=Green |first12=Kevin |last13=Huber |first13=Alexander M. |last14=Kleine-Punte |first14=Andrea |last15=Maat |first15=Bert |last16=Marx |first16=Mathieu |last17=Mawman |first17=Deborah |last18=Mosnier |first18=Isabelle |last19=O'Connor |first19=Alec Fitzgerald |last20=O'Leary |first20=Stephen |last21=Rousset |first21=Alexandra |last22=Schauwers |first22=Karen |last23=Skarzynski |first23=Henryk |last24=Skarzynski |first24=Piotr H. |last25=Sterkers |first25=Olivier |last26=Terranti |first26=Assia |last27=Truy |first27=Eric |last28=Van de Heyning |first28=Paul |last29=Venail |first29=Fr\u00e9deric |last30=Vincent |first30=Christophe |last31=Lazard |first31=Diane S. |title=Factors Affecting Auditory Performance of Postlinguistically Deaf Adults Using Cochlear Implants: An Update with 2251 Patients |journal=Audiology and Neurotology |date=2013 |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=36\u201347 |doi=10.1159/000343189|pmid=23095305 |url=http://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/69118/1/Dillier_HuberA_etal_AudiolNeurotol_2012.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Ba\u015fkent |first1=D. |last2=Gaudrain |first2=E. |last3=Tamati |first3=T.N. |last4=Wagner |first4=A. |title=Perception and psychoacoustics of speech in cochlear implant users, in Scientific Foundations of Audiology: Perspectives from Physics, Biology, Modeling, and Medicine, Eds.

The deleterious effects of aging on central auditory processing abilities are thought to play an important role in impacting an individual's speech perception abilities with CI. Prolonged duration of deafness is another factor which is thought to have a negative impact on overall speech understanding outcomes for CI users.

CI bypasses the normal acoustic hearing process to replace it with electric signals which directly stimulate the auditory nerve. A person with a cochlear implant receiving intensive auditory training may learn to interpret those signals as sound and speech. However, one third of deaf children do not develop language if they are on a CI program alone and have no sign language input.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVIwR7YtVyA]\n\nThe implant has two main components. The outside component is generally worn behind the ear, but could also be attached to clothing, for example, in young children. This component, the sound processor, contains microphones, electronics that include [[Digital Signal Processor]] chips, battery, and a coil which transmits a signal to the implant across the skin.

They believe that measuring a child's success only by their mastery of speech will lead to a poor self-image as \"disabled\" (because the implants do not produce normal hearing) rather than having the healthy self-concept of a proudly Deaf person.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nad.org/site/pp.asp?c=foINKQMBF&b=138140 |title= Cochlear Implants|author= NAD Cochlear Implant Committee|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070220131900/http://www.nad.org/site/pp.asp?c=foINKQMBF&b=138140|archivedate= 2007-02-20}}</ref>\n\nChildren with cochlear implants are more likely to be educated [[oralism|orally]], in the standard fashion, and without access to [[sign language]] and are often isolated from other deaf children and from sign language.<ref name=Atlantic>{{cite news|last1=Ringo|first1=Allegra|title=Understanding Deafness: Not Everyone Wants to Be 'Fixed'|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/08/understanding-deafness-not-everyone-wants-to-be-fixed/278527/|work=The Atlantic|date=August 9, 2013}}</ref> Cochlear implants have been one of the technological and social factors implicated in the decline of [[sign language]]s in the developed world.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Johnston|first1=T|title=W(h)ither the deaf community?

However, because of her confrontational approach to the topic, Walker's artwork is reminiscent of [[Andy Warhol]]'s [[Pop Art]] during the 1960s (indeed, Walker says she adored Warhol growing up as a child).<ref name=\"Looking at the History of the United States, Including the Shocking Parts.\" /> Her nightmarish yet fantastical images incorporate a cinematic feel. Walker uses images from historical textbooks to show how enslaved African-Americans were depicted during Antebellum South.<ref name=\"Looking at the History of the United States, Including the Shocking Parts.\" /> The silhouette was typically a genteel tradition in American art history; it was often used for family portraits and book illustrations. Walker carried on this portrait tradition but used them to create characters in a nightmarish world, a world that reveals the brutality of American racism and inequality.\n\nWalker's work pokes holes in the romantic idea of the past\u2014exposing the humiliating, desperate reality that was life for plantation slaves. She also incorporates ominous, sharp fragments of the South's landscape; such as Spanish moss trees and a giant moon obscured by dramatic clouds. These images surround the viewer and create a circular, claustrophobic space. This circular format paid homage to another art form, the 360-degree historical painting known as the cyclorama.<ref name=\"50 CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS YOU SHOULD KNOW\" /> Some of her images are grotesque, for example, in ''The Battle of Atlanta,''<ref>[http://www.sikkemajenkinsco.com/karawalker.html Sikkema Jenkins & Co.\u2014Kara Walker]</ref> a white man, presumably a Southern soldier, is raping a black girl while her brother watches in shock, a white child is about to insert his sword into a nearly-lynched black woman's vagina, and a male black slave rains tears all over an adolescent white boy. The use of physical stereotypes such as flatter profiles, bigger lips, straighter nose, and longer hair helps the viewer immediately distinguish the \"negroes\" from the \"whities\". It is blatantly clear in her artwork who is in power and who is the victim to the people with power. There is a hierarchy in America relating to race and gender with white males at the top and women of color (specifically black) at the bottom. Walker depicts the inequalities and mistreatment of African Americans by their white counterparts. Viewers at the [[Studio Museum in Harlem]] looked sickly, shocked, and some appalled upon seeing her exhibition.

(Our Tools Were Rudimentary, Yet We Pressed On)'', the silhouetted characters are against a background of colored light projections. This gives the piece a transparent quality, evocative of the production cels from the animated films of the thirties. It also references the well-known plantation story Gone With the Wind and the Technicolor film based on it. Also, the light projectors were set up so that the shadows of the viewers were also cast on the wall, making them characters and encouraging them to really assess the work's tough themes.<ref name=\"50 CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS YOU SHOULD KNOW\" /> In 2005, she created the exhibit ''8 Possible Beginnings'' or: ''The Creation of African-America, a Moving Picture'', which introduced moving images and sound. This helped immerse the viewers even deeper into her dark worlds. In this exhibit, the silhouettes are used as shadow puppets. Also, she uses the voice of herself and her daughter to suggest how the heritage of early American slavery has affected her own image as an artist and woman of color.<ref name=\"50 CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS YOU SHOULD KNOW\" />\n\nIn response to [[Hurricane Katrina]], Walker created \"After the Deluge,\" since the hurricane had devastated many poor and black areas of [[New Orleans]].

However, because of her confrontational approach to the topic, Walker's artwork is reminiscent of [[Andy Warhol]]'s [[Pop Art]] during the 1960s (indeed, Walker says she adored Warhol growing up as a child).<ref name=\"Looking at the History of the United States, Including the Shocking Parts.\" /> Her nightmarish yet fantastical images incorporate a cinematic feel. Walker uses images from historical textbooks to show how enslaved African-Americans were depicted during Antebellum South.<ref name=\"Looking at the History of the United States, Including the Shocking Parts.\" /> The silhouette was typically a genteel tradition in American art history; it was often used for family portraits and book illustrations. Walker carried on this portrait tradition but used them to create characters in a nightmarish world, a world that reveals the brutality of American racism and inequality.\n\nWalker's work pokes holes in the romantic idea of the past\u2014exposing the humiliating, desperate reality that was life for plantation slaves. She also incorporates ominous, sharp fragments of the South's landscape; such as Spanish moss trees and a giant moon obscured by dramatic clouds. These images surround the viewer and create a circular, claustrophobic space. This circular format paid homage to another art form, the 360-degree historical painting known as the cyclorama.<ref name=\"50 CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS YOU SHOULD KNOW\" /> Some of her images are grotesque, for example, in ''The Battle of Atlanta,''<ref>[http://www.sikkemajenkinsco.com/karawalker.html Sikkema Jenkins & Co.\u2014Kara Walker]</ref> a white man, presumably a Southern soldier, is raping a black girl while her brother watches in shock, a white child is about to insert his sword into a nearly-lynched black woman's vagina, and a male black slave rains tears all over an adolescent white boy. The use of physical stereotypes such as flatter profiles, bigger lips, straighter nose, and longer hair helps the viewer immediately distinguish the \"negroes\" from the \"whities\". It is blatantly clear in her artwork who is in power and who is the victim to the people with power. There is a hierarchy in America relating to race and gender with white males at the top and women of color (specifically black) at the bottom. Walker depicts the inequalities and mistreatment of African Americans by their white counterparts. Viewers at the [[Studio Museum in Harlem]] looked sickly, shocked, and some appalled upon seeing her exhibition. [[Thelma Golden]], the museum's chief curator, said that \"throughout her career, Walker has challenged and changed the way we look at and understand American history.

(Our Tools Were Rudimentary, Yet We Pressed On)'', the silhouetted characters are against a background of colored light projections. This gives the piece a transparent quality, evocative of the production cels from the animated films of the thirties. It also references the well-known plantation story Gone With the Wind and the Technicolor film based on it. Also, the light projectors were set up so that the shadows of the viewers were also cast on the wall, making them characters and encouraging them to really assess the work's tough themes.<ref name=\"50 CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS YOU SHOULD KNOW\" /> In 2005, she created the exhibit ''8 Possible Beginnings'' or: ''The Creation of African-America, a Moving Picture'', which introduced moving images and sound. This helped immerse the viewers even deeper into her dark worlds. In this exhibit, the silhouettes are used as shadow puppets. Also, she uses the voice of herself and her daughter to suggest how the heritage of early American slavery has affected her own image as an artist and woman of color.<ref name=\"50 CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS YOU SHOULD KNOW\" />\n\nIn response to [[Hurricane Katrina]], Walker created \"After the Deluge,\" since the hurricane had devastated many poor and black areas of [[New Orleans]]. Walker was bombarded with news images of \"black corporeality,\" including fatalities from the hurricane reduced to bodies and nothing more. She likened these casualties to African slaves piled onto ships for the [[Middle Passage]], the Atlantic crossing to America.<ref name=\"Looking at the History of the United States, Including the Shocking Parts.\"/>\n\n{{quote|I was seeing images that were all too familiar.

Over the next eleven days it was involved in severe fighting in the area around Hinges and Robecq. On 22 April, 1st Bn, Rifle Brigade, together with the 1st Hampshires, took part in an attack which helped to secure the Canal. It was during this fighting that Lance Sergeant Joseph Woodall won his Victoria Cross on the far side of the canal at La Pannerie, near Hinges.\n\nHis citation read:\n\n{{quote|La Pannerie, France, 22 April 1918, Lance Sergeant Joseph Edward Woodall, 1st Bn, The Rifle Brigade.\n\nFor most conspicuous bravery and fine leadership during an attack. ( La Pannerie, France ) Sjt. Woodall was in command of a platoon which, during an advance, was held up by a machine gun.\nOn his own initiative he rushed forward and, single-handed, captured the gun and eight men. After the objective had been gained, heavy fire was encountered from a farmhouse some 200 yards in front. Sjt. Woodall collected ten men and, with great dash and gallantry, rushed the farm and took thirty prisoners. Shortly afterwards, when the officer in command was killed, he took entire command, reorganised the two platoons, and disposed them most skilfully.\n\nThroughout the day, in spite of intense shelling and machine-gun fire, this gallant N.C.O. was constantly on the move, encouraging the men and finding out and sending back invaluable information.

Over the next eleven days it was involved in severe fighting in the area around Hinges and Robecq. On 22 April, 1st Bn, Rifle Brigade, together with the 1st Hampshires, took part in an attack which helped to secure the Canal. It was during this fighting that Lance Sergeant Joseph Woodall won his Victoria Cross on the far side of the canal at La Pannerie, near Hinges.\n\nHis citation read:\n\n{{quote|La Pannerie, France, 22 April 1918, Lance Sergeant Joseph Edward Woodall, 1st Bn, The Rifle Brigade.\n\nFor most conspicuous bravery and fine leadership during an attack. ( La Pannerie, France ) Sjt. Woodall was in command of a platoon which, during an advance, was held up by a machine gun.\nOn his own initiative he rushed forward and, single-handed, captured the gun and eight men. After the objective had been gained, heavy fire was encountered from a farmhouse some 200 yards in front. Sjt. Woodall collected ten men and, with great dash and gallantry, rushed the farm and took thirty prisoners. Shortly afterwards, when the officer in command was killed, he took entire command, reorganised the two platoons, and disposed them most skilfully.\n\nThroughout the day, in spite of intense shelling and machine-gun fire, this gallant N.C.O. was constantly on the move, encouraging the men and finding out and sending back invaluable information. The example set by Sjt. Woodall was simply magnificent, and had a marked effect on the troops.
