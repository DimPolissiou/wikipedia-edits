In 1994, the Dean and Niyazov were both evidently unhappy with the end result, and Niyazov ordered the book to be withdrawn and established a committee to rewrite the book \"as [The Dean] should have wanted it\". However, the resultant committee that Niyazov established was comprised not of academics or professional historians but of a poet, two fiction writers and a historian (whom Orazov claimed were respectable professionals during Soviet times but had since fallen into alcoholism). The resultant book again failed to meet Niyazov's expectations so he again ordered it withdrawn but this time took on the responsibility of writing the book himself.\n\nNiyazov issued the work's first volume in 2001, saying it would \"eliminate all shortcomings, to raise the spirit of the Turkmens\".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1634100.stm | work=BBC News | title=The cult of the Turkmen leader | date=2 November 2001}}</ref> In 2004, Niyazov issued a second volume, covering morals, philosophy and life conduct.

Five months later after suffering a third major defeat on the battlefield,<ref>van Ypersele, p. 287</ref> the ancient Habsburg Monarchy was left humiliated by \"the peasant regiments of a small Balkan kingdom\u201d. Franz Ferdinand had not been avenged, with the Dual Monarchy losing twice as many men as the Serbs had.

In September [[Bulgaria]] signed a treaty of alliance with Germany and quickly mobilized its army. <ref>hall 2014, p 162</ref> On 6 October 1915, combined [[Germany in WWI|German]] and [[Austro-Hungarian Army|Austro-Hungarian]] forces under the command of [[August von Mackensen|Field Marshall August von Mackensen]] attacked Serbia from the north and west with the intention of drawing the bulk of the Serbian forces along the [[Sava]] and [[Danube]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nOn 11 October, without any previous declaration of war, the Bulgarian started making attacks on Serbian border positions;  then on 14 October Bulgaria finally declared war on Serbia, the First and Second Armies under the command of [[Kliment Boyadzhiev|General Boyadzhiev]], advanced into the Timok region of northeastern Serbia<ref name=\":8\" /> with the mission of cutting the vital rail line that ran from Salonika, up the Vardar and Morava River valleys, and depriving Serbia of reinforcements and artillery ammunition.<ref name=\":6\">Sanders 2016, p. 248</ref> Numbering nearly 300,000 men, the forces of Bulgaria quickly overwhelmed the weak Serbian units along the frontier.<ref name=\":8\">Buttar 2015, p.341</ref> The Serbian Army had 250,000 men of which a large number were already battling 300,000 Germans and Austrians in the north.

[[Radomir Putnik|Field Marshal Putnik]] begins concentrating his troops for the purpose of securing access to the plateau of Gnjilane known as the \"[[Kosovo Polje|Field of Blackbirds]]\"; the region that resonated through five hundred years of Serbian history was the site of a [[Battle of Kosovo|famous battle in 1389]] where the Serbs were defeated by the Turks, and later became the birthplace of Serbian nationalism.<ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe entire Bulgarian army, supported from the north by parts of the Eleventh German Army, now advanced against the Serbs.

Nevertheless, only two options, retreat, and counter-attack were seriously considered, while the third one, capitulation, was not an option on the table; the Serbian government led by Prime Minister [[Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107]], [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Prince Regent Alexander]] and the Supreme Command under Field Marshall Radomir Putnik made the decision to order a general withdrawal and fight on from exile.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe only possible avenue of escape lay to the southwest and northwest, over the towering [[Korab|Korab and Prokletije mountain ranges]] of [[Albania]] and Montenegro, part of the [[Dinaric Alps]], a region of which the mean altitude is over {{convert|6,000|feet|meters}} as the snow began to fall. The Serbian Government planned to reorganise and reform the army with the help and support from the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]]. \n\nOn 23 November, Vojvoda Putnik ordered all Serbian forces to use the last of the artillery ammunition, then bury the cannon, taking breechblocks and sights with them; if burying the guns was impossible, they were to be rendered useless.<ref name=\":6\" />  \n\nOn 25 November 1915, an official order of retreat addressed to the commanders of all armies, was published by the Serbian High Command: \n\n{{Quote/sandbox|text=The only way out of this grave situation is a retreat to the Adriatic coast.

It also had the responsibility to act as a rearguard against an attack by the Austro-Hungarians, Bulgarians, and Germans.

Once across the Vizier's Bridge, the troops, who had retreated from Macedonia, would continue west, through Albania, ultimately to Alessio. The Timok Division would also continue to move south and then west through Albania to [[Durr\u00ebs]].

The southern route presented the most direct way to make contact with Sarrail\u2019s Army of the Orient. The General Headquarters had asked the commanders of these groups to keep in constant telegraphic communication, but from the first day of the operations, this was found to be impossible. The geography of the country did not allow of any other means of communication, so that the commanders of these groups were, during the whole movement, left to their own devices.\n\nAll the troops part of this group were placed under the orders of the commander of the Army of the Timok.<ref name=\":5\" /> The column left on 25 November and moved south all the way to [[Elbasan]].

The mission of the troops of the defense of Belgrade was to cover the retreat of the Army of the Timok as long as that army had not begun its movement of retreat, and then to retire in its turn,<ref name=\":5\" /> because of that the northern column delayed its departure from Pe\u0107 until 7 December. It also had the responsibility to act as a rearguard against an attack by the Austro-Hungarians, Bulgarians, and Germans.

Once across the Vizier's Bridge, the troops, who had retreated from Macedonia, would continue west, through Albania, ultimately to Alessio.

The southern route presented the most direct way to make contact with Sarrail\u2019s Army of the Orient. The General Headquarters had asked the commanders of these groups to keep in constant telegraphic communication, but from the first day of the operations, this was found to be impossible. The geography of the country did not allow of any other means of communication, so that the commanders of these groups were, during the whole movement, left to their own devices.\n\nAll the troops part of this group were placed under the orders of the commander of the Army of the Timok.<ref name=\":5\" /> The column left on 25 November and moved south all the way to [[Elbasan]].

It is considered to be \"the Gateway to the Arctic\" and has Ontario's only saltwater port.<ref name=ont>{{cite web|url=https://www.ontario.ca/en/about_ontario/004660.html|title=About Ontario: Moosonee|publisher=Queen's Printer for Ontario|accessdate=2010-12-22}}</ref> Nearby on [[Moose Factory Island]] is the community of [[Moose Factory]] to which it is connected by [[water taxi]] in the summer and [[ice road]] in the winter.\n\nMoosonee is the railhead of the [[Ontario Northland Railway]] where goods are transferred to [[barge]]s and [[aircraft]] for transport to more northerly communities. Moosonee is not particularly far north, being located at 51\u00b0N\u2014which is roughly the same latitude as [[Saskatoon]], [[Calgary]], [[London|London (UK)]], and [[Berlin]]\u2014but is colder due to its proximity to [[Hudson Bay]], and isolated due to its lack of road access to the rest of Ontario. The community was the site of a fur trading post set up in 1903 by [[Revillon Fr\u00e8res]], competitors to the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] which later bought out R\u00e9villon.\n\nMoosonee formerly held the status of a development area, the only community in the province with that designation, and was governed by a locally elected board subject to formal appointment by the Ontario provincial government. It became incorporated as a town effective January 1, 2001, with an elected mayor and four-person council. The most recent municipal council was elected on October 27, 2014, and three replacement councillors were elected in a by-election held on July 7, 2015. For 2014&ndash;2018 the town council consists of mayor Wayne Taipale, and councillors Tony Tourville, John Moore, Carman Tozer and Cathy Turner.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moosonee.ca/images/stories/2014/Town%20of%20Moosonee_20141028_111109.pdf |accessdate=2015-05-11 |title=Town of Moosonee: Declaration of Election |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402093659/http://www.moosonee.ca/images/stories/2014/Town%20of%20Moosonee_20141028_111109.pdf |archive-date=2015-04-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Moosonee Revillon Freres.JPG|thumb|left|230px|[[R\u00e9villon Fr\u00e8res]] store in Moosonee]]\nIn 1900, Annie Hardisty and her two daughters were the first settlers on the site.<ref name=mcp>{{cite web |url=http://www.wakenagun.ca/Adobe/moosonee.pdf |title=Moosonee Community Profile |publisher=Wakenagun Community Futures Development Corporation |accessdate=2010-12-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706212605/http://www.wakenagun.ca/Adobe/moosonee.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> But the place really developed when on June 6, 1903, four canoes and a crew of 21 persons of the [[R\u00e9villon Fr\u00e8res]] company arrived on the banks of the Moose River near the much older Moose Factory to establish the '''Moose River Post'''. This Parisian [[furrier]] had ambitious plans to set up a chain of [[fur trade|fur trading]] posts in direct competition with the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], including five on [[James Bay]]. But it suffered a setback when their supply ship that carried all the provisions shipwrecked near [[Chisasibi, Quebec|Fort George]].<ref name=mdab>{{Citation |title=Revillon Fr\u00e8res |year=2002 |publisher=The Moosonee Development Area Board}}</ref>\n\nMoose River Post became the most important location for R\u00e9villon Fr\u00e8res and was quickly expanded with a staff house, carpenter's shop, warehouse, and sawmill. The buildings were spaced far apart as a preventive measure to minimize the spread of fire. By 1912, it was reported that \"the whole line of good substantial buildings, built principally for their French Canadian employees, stretches along the river front for nearly a mile northward from the residence of the inspector.\"<ref name=mdab/>\n\nMoose River Post (and Moose Factory) were prosperous but isolated. It was supplied only once per year by ship coming from [[Montreal]] around the [[Labrador Peninsula]]. Mail arrived only four times per year, twice by canoe and twice by toboggan. During [[World War I]], R\u00e9villon Fr\u00e8res' chartered supply ship was requisitioned for war service. So from then on until 1932, the post was supplied by [[scow]]s from [[Pagwa River, Ontario|Pagwa]] on the [[National Transcontinental Railway]] coming down the Pagwachuan, Kenogami, and [[Albany River]]s.<ref name=mdab/>\n\nIn 1932, the [[Ontario Northland Railway|Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway]] was extended from [[Cochrane, Ontario|Cochrane]] to Moose River Post, that was renamed at that time to Moosonee, derived from the Cree word ''M\u00f4sonihk'' meaning \"at the Moose [River]\". In 1936, R\u00e9villon Fr\u00e8res sold its Canadian operations to the Hudson's Bay Company and the Moosonee post closed.<ref name=ont/><ref name=mdab/> The HBC also exited the fur trade and opened a retail store in Moosonee (now Northern Store part of [[The North West Company]]). With the end of the fur trade business, Moosonee's economy became centered on transportation.<ref name=\"TOM\"/>\n\nIn 1962, Moosonee became the site of [[CFS Moosonee|RCAF Station Moosonee]] that was part of NORAD's [[Pinetree Line]] chain of radar stations. It closed in 1975 and some of its buildings were used by the Town after the closure, including the base swimming pool and recreation centre.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/moosonee/ |title=Moosonee |publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |author=James Marsh |accessdate=2010-12-22}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968, the town was classified as a Development Area Board.

Yard===\n[[Image:S IMG 1733.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The ''[[Polar Bear Express]]'' at Moosonee Station]]\nThe main method of access is by [[Ontario Northland Railway]] which reached the town in 1932 and which provides passenger and freight train service to [[Cochrane, Ontario|Cochrane]].<ref name=\"TOM\" /> Ontario Northland's ''[[Polar Bear Express]]'' train runs to Cochrane six days per week during the summer months and five days per week during the rest of the year. Moosonee Station is located at the end of First Street and has a small station building, freight shed, diesel shed and an outdoor yard to store trains.\n\nThere are also two freight trains per week. During the summer and early fall shipping season, goods can be transported from Moosonee by barge. In January 2007, responsibility for the Port of Moosonee was transferred from the federal government to the Town of Moosonee.\n\n===Airport===\nThe town is also accessible via the [[Moosonee Airport]], served with scheduled flights of [[Air Creebec]], [[Moosonee Water Aerodrome]] and cargo service through North Star Air.\n\n===Roads===\nMoosonee is inaccessible by road. The nearest road outside of Moosonee ends at [[Otter Rapids, Ontario|Otter Rapids]] which is {{convert|148.9|km|mi|1}} south of Moosonee. During the early months of 2008, a winter road was open between Moosonee and the provincial road system at Otter Rapids. This road was built to support the twinning of the electric transmission lines that run from Otter Rapids to Moosonee. Local residents report it taking five or six hours to get to [[Timmins]] from Moosonee via Otter Rapids and [[Smooth Rock Falls, Ontario|Smooth Rock Falls]]. This road was not in service in 2009. In late 2009, members of the [[Moose Cree First Nation]] voted for the construction of a seasonal winter road south to Otter Rapids.\n\nDuring the winter, [[ice road]]s are plowed and maintained on the ice across the [[Moose River (Ontario)|Moose River]] to [[Moose Factory, Ontario|Moose Factory]] and [[winter road]]s are maintained to the coastal communities of [[Fort Albany, Ontario|Fort Albany]], [[Kashechewan First Nation|Kashechewan]] and [[Attawapiskat First Nation|Attawapiskat]]. In recent years, much of the traffic heading up north has been destined for the [[Victor Diamond Mine]] operated by [[De Beers]] Canada to the west of Attawapiskat.\n\nFeasibility studies have been undertaken on the construction of a permanent all-season road to the communities of Moosonee, [[Fort Albany, Ontario|Fort Albany]], [[Kashechewan]] and [[Attawapiskat]].<ref name=allseasonroad>[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/james-bay-coast-all-season-road-feasibility-study-1.4292818 \"Ontario's far north one step closer to building all-season road\"]. [[CBCS-FM|CBC Sudbury]], September 17, 2017.</ref> The project, if undertaken, will entail a \"coastal road\" connecting the four communities with each other, as well as a road to link the coastal road to the provincial highway system at [[Fraserdale, Ontario|Fraserdale]], [[Kapuskasing]] or [[Hearst, Ontario|Hearst]].<ref>[https://www.mushkegowuk.com/?page_id=3577 \"All Season Road\"].

Most homes subscribe to either Creecable cable TV or a satellite TV service to access any television service, following the 2012 closure of the local [[CBC Television]] and [[TVOntario]] repeaters.\n\n[[Ontera]], formerly Ontario Northland Telecommunications, but now owned by Bell, provides telecommunications service in Moosonee ([[North American Numbering Plan|NPA-NXX]] 705-336).\n\n==Attractions and tourism==\n[[File:Moosonee waterfront.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Waterfront of Moosonee]]\n\nNotable attractions in Moosonee include:\n* Railway Car Museum - displaying the cultural history of the area in an old Baggage Car of the Temiskaming & Northern Ontario Railway.\n* MNR Interpretive Centre - displays and videos at the office of the Ministry of Natural Resources highlighting the wildlife, geological, and geographical features of the region.\n* Excursions to the bird sanctuaries of Shipsands Island and the [[Southern James Bay]].\n\nThe [[Tidewater Provincial Park]] is on the nearby Charles Island, adjacent to Moose Factory Island.\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n\n{{notelist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikivoyage|Moosonee}}\n{{Commons category|Moosonee}}\n* [http://www.moosonee.ca Town of Moosonee official website]\n\n{{Geographic location\n| Center = Moosonee\n| East = [[Factory Island 1, Ontario|Factory Island 1]], [[Unorganized North Cochrane District|Unorganized North Cochrane]]\n| Southeast = [[Moose Factory 68, Ontario|Moose Factory 68]]\n| Southwest = [[Unorganized North Cochrane District|Unorganized North Cochrane]]\n| Northwest = [[Unorganized North Cochrane District|Unorganized North Cochrane]]\n| Northeast = {{flagicon|NU}} [[Baffin, Unorganized|Unorganized Baffin]]<br>''[[James Bay]]''\n}}\n{{Cochrane District}}\n\n[[Category:1903 establishments in Ontario]]\n[[Category:Hudson's Bay Company trading posts]]\n[[Category:Municipalities in Cochrane District]]\n[[Category:Populated coastal places in Canada]]\n[[Category:Road-inaccessible communities of Ontario]]\n[[Category:Single-tier municipalities in Ontario]]\n[[Category:Towns in Ontario]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n|name                   = Moosonee\n|official_name          = Town of Moosonee\n|nickname               =\n|settlement_type        = [[List of towns in Ontario|Town]] ([[List of municipalities in Ontario#Single-tier municipalities|single-tier]])\n|total_type             =\n|motto                  =\n|image_skyline          = Moosonee downtown aerial.jpg\n|image_caption          =\n|image_flag             =\n|flag_size              =\n|image_blank_emblem     = Moosonee logo.jpg\n|blank_emblem_type      =\n|blank_emblem_size      =\n|pushpin_map            = Ontario#Canada\n|pushpin_mapsize        = 200\n|subdivision_type       = Country\n|subdivision_name       = Canada\n|subdivision_type1      = [[Provinces of Canada|Province]]\n|subdivision_name1      = [[Ontario]]\n|subdivision_type2      = [[List of regions of Canada|Region]]\n|subdivision_name2      = [[Northeastern Ontario]]\n|subdivision_type3      = [[Census divisions of Ontario|District]]\n|subdivision_name3      = [[Cochrane District|Cochrane]]\n|government_footnotes   =\n|government_type        =\n|leader_title           = Mayor\n|leader_name            = Wayne Taipale\n|leader_title1          = Councillors\n|leader_name1           = {{Collapsible list\n|title = List\n|frame_style = border:none;

It is considered to be \"the Gateway to the Arctic\" and has Ontario's only saltwater port.<ref name=ont>{{cite web|url=https://www.ontario.ca/en/about_ontario/004660.html|title=About Ontario: Moosonee|publisher=Queen's Printer for Ontario|accessdate=2010-12-22}}</ref> Nearby on [[Moose Factory Island]] is the community of [[Moose Factory]] to which it is connected by [[water taxi]] in the summer and [[ice road]] in the winter.\n\nMoosonee is the railhead of the [[Ontario Northland Railway]] where goods are transferred to [[barge]]s and [[aircraft]] for transport to more northerly communities. Moosonee is not particularly far north, being located at 51\u00b0N\u2014which is roughly the same latitude as [[Saskatoon]], [[Calgary]], [[London|London (UK)]], and [[Berlin]]\u2014but is colder due to its proximity to [[Hudson Bay]], and isolated due to its lack of road access to the rest of Ontario. The community was the site of a fur trading post set up in 1903 by [[Revillon Fr\u00e8res]], competitors to the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] which later bought out R\u00e9villon.\n\nMoosonee formerly held the status of a development area, the only community in the province with that designation, and was governed by a locally elected board subject to formal appointment by the Ontario provincial government. It became incorporated as a town effective January 1, 2001, with an elected mayor and four-person council. The most recent municipal council was elected on October 27, 2014, and three replacement councillors were elected in a by-election held on July 7, 2015. For 2014&ndash;2018 the town council consists of mayor Wayne Taipale, and councillors Tony Tourville, John Moore, Carman Tozer and Cathy Turner.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moosonee.ca/images/stories/2014/Town%20of%20Moosonee_20141028_111109.pdf |accessdate=2015-05-11 |title=Town of Moosonee: Declaration of Election |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402093659/http://www.moosonee.ca/images/stories/2014/Town%20of%20Moosonee_20141028_111109.pdf |archive-date=2015-04-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Moosonee Revillon Freres.JPG|thumb|left|230px|[[R\u00e9villon Fr\u00e8res]] store in Moosonee]]\nIn 1900, Annie Hardisty and her two daughters were the first settlers on the site.<ref name=mcp>{{cite web |url=http://www.wakenagun.ca/Adobe/moosonee.pdf |title=Moosonee Community Profile |publisher=Wakenagun Community Futures Development Corporation |accessdate=2010-12-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706212605/http://www.wakenagun.ca/Adobe/moosonee.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> But the place really developed when on June 6, 1903, four canoes and a crew of 21 persons of the [[R\u00e9villon Fr\u00e8res]] company arrived on the banks of the Moose River near the much older Moose Factory to establish the '''Moose River Post'''. This Parisian [[furrier]] had ambitious plans to set up a chain of [[fur trade|fur trading]] posts in direct competition with the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], including five on [[James Bay]]. But it suffered a setback when their supply ship that carried all the provisions shipwrecked near [[Chisasibi, Quebec|Fort George]].<ref name=mdab>{{Citation |title=Revillon Fr\u00e8res |year=2002 |publisher=The Moosonee Development Area Board}}</ref>\n\nMoose River Post became the most important location for R\u00e9villon Fr\u00e8res and was quickly expanded with a staff house, carpenter's shop, warehouse, and sawmill. The buildings were spaced far apart as a preventive measure to minimize the spread of fire. By 1912, it was reported that \"the whole line of good substantial buildings, built principally for their French Canadian employees, stretches along the river front for nearly a mile northward from the residence of the inspector.\"<ref name=mdab/>\n\nMoose River Post (and Moose Factory) were prosperous but isolated. It was supplied only once per year by ship coming from [[Montreal]] around the [[Labrador Peninsula]]. Mail arrived only four times per year, twice by canoe and twice by toboggan. During [[World War I]], R\u00e9villon Fr\u00e8res' chartered supply ship was requisitioned for war service. So from then on until 1932, the post was supplied by [[scow]]s from [[Pagwa River, Ontario|Pagwa]] on the [[National Transcontinental Railway]] coming down the Pagwachuan, Kenogami, and [[Albany River]]s.<ref name=mdab/>\n\nIn 1932, the [[Ontario Northland Railway|Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway]] was extended from [[Cochrane, Ontario|Cochrane]] to Moose River Post, that was renamed at that time to Moosonee, derived from the Cree word ''M\u00f4sonihk'' meaning \"at the Moose [River]\". In 1936, R\u00e9villon Fr\u00e8res sold its Canadian operations to the Hudson's Bay Company and the Moosonee post closed.<ref name=ont/><ref name=mdab/> The HBC also exited the fur trade and opened a retail store in Moosonee (now Northern Store part of [[The North West Company]]). With the end of the fur trade business, Moosonee's economy became centered on transportation.<ref name=\"TOM\"/>\n\nIn 1962, Moosonee became the site of [[CFS Moosonee|RCAF Station Moosonee]] that was part of NORAD's [[Pinetree Line]] chain of radar stations. It closed in 1975 and some of its buildings were used by the Town after the closure, including the base swimming pool and recreation centre.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/moosonee/ |title=Moosonee |publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |author=James Marsh |accessdate=2010-12-22}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968, the town was classified as a Development Area Board.

Bishop Belleau School also provides a French Language Instructional Unit for children who are entitled to be educated in French. There is a public high school, [[Northern Lights Secondary School]], that provides grades nine through twelve. [[Northern College (Ontario)|Northern College]]'s Moosonee campus provides some post-secondary programs.\n\nHealth services are provided through the [[Weeneebayko Area Health Authority#Moosonee|Moosonee Health Clinic]] of the [[Weeneebayko Area Health Authority]] (merger of the formerly '''James Bay General Hospital''' and the '''Weeneebayko Health Ahtuskaywin''' which operated Weeneebayko General Hospital in [[Moose Factory, Ontario|Moose Factory]]).\n\nPayukotayno (pronounced pay-k-ta-no) Family Services provide child care and social assistance to Moosonee, [[Moose Factory]], [[Attawapiskat]], [[Fort Albany, Ontario|Fort Albany]], [[Kashechewan]] and [[Peawanuck]]. Payukotayno is a recognized Ontario Children's Aid Society and means 'one family' in Cree.\n\n==Climate==\nMoosonee has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfb''), with warm summers and cold winters. James Bay acts as a thermal reservoir to moderate spring and fall temperatures. Freeze-up on the Moose River normally occurs between late November and mid-December, with mean daily minimum January temperatures approximately {{convert|-27|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}. Spring break-up, or spring thaw, usually occurs in April. Mean annual precipitation is approximately {{convert|682|mm|in|1}}, and mean annual snowfall is approximately {{convert|213|cm|in|1}}. Precipitation is somewhat higher in summer than at other times of the year. [[Severe thunderstorm]]s can occur from time to time.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Moosonee was {{convert|37.8|C|0}} on 31 July 1975.<ref name=\"climate\"/> The coldest temperature ever

Yard===\n[[Image:S IMG 1733.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The ''[[Polar Bear Express]]'' at Moosonee Station]]\nThe main method of access is by [[Ontario Northland Railway]] which reached the town in 1932 and which provides passenger and freight train service to [[Cochrane, Ontario|Cochrane]].<ref name=\"TOM\" /> Ontario Northland's ''[[Polar Bear Express]]'' train runs to Cochrane six days per week during the summer months and five days per week during the rest of the year. Moosonee Station is located at the end of First Street and has a small station building, freight shed, diesel shed and an outdoor yard to store trains.\n\nThere are also two freight trains per week. During the summer and early fall shipping season, goods can be transported from Moosonee by barge. In January 2007, responsibility for the Port of Moosonee was transferred from the federal government to the Town of Moosonee.\n\n===Airport===\nThe town is also accessible via the [[Moosonee Airport]], served with scheduled flights of [[Air Creebec]], [[Moosonee Water Aerodrome]] and cargo service through North Star Air.\n\n===Roads===\nMoosonee is inaccessible by road. The nearest road outside of Moosonee ends at [[Otter Rapids, Ontario|Otter Rapids]] which is {{convert|148.9|km|mi|1}} south of Moosonee. During the early months of 2008, a winter road was open between Moosonee and the provincial road system at Otter Rapids. This road was built to support the twinning of the electric transmission lines that run from Otter Rapids to Moosonee. Local residents report it taking five or six hours to get to [[Timmins]] from Moosonee via Otter Rapids and [[Smooth Rock Falls, Ontario|Smooth Rock Falls]]. This road was not in service in 2009. In late 2009, members of the [[Moose Cree First Nation]] voted for the construction of a seasonal winter road south to Otter Rapids.\n\nDuring the winter, [[ice road]]s are plowed and maintained on the ice across the [[Moose River (Ontario)|Moose River]] to [[Moose Factory, Ontario|Moose Factory]] and [[winter road]]s are maintained to the coastal communities of [[Fort Albany, Ontario|Fort Albany]], [[Kashechewan First Nation|Kashechewan]] and [[Attawapiskat First Nation|Attawapiskat]]. In recent years, much of the traffic heading up north has been destined for the [[Victor Diamond Mine]] operated by [[De Beers]] Canada to the west of Attawapiskat.\n\nFeasibility studies have been undertaken on the construction of a permanent all-season road to the communities of Moosonee, [[Fort Albany, Ontario|Fort Albany]], [[Kashechewan]] and [[Attawapiskat]].<ref name=allseasonroad>[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/james-bay-coast-all-season-road-feasibility-study-1.4292818 \"Ontario's far north one step closer to building all-season road\"]. [[CBCS-FM|CBC Sudbury]], September 17, 2017.</ref> The project, if undertaken, will entail a \"coastal road\" connecting the four communities with each other, as well as a road to link the coastal road to the provincial highway system at [[Fraserdale, Ontario|Fraserdale]], [[Kapuskasing]] or [[Hearst, Ontario|Hearst]].<ref>[https://www.mushkegowuk.com/?page_id=3577 \"All Season Road\"]. [[Mushkegowuk Council]].</ref>\n\n==Communications==\nMoosonee has a local radio station, [[CHMO]] 1450 AM, that is generally operated by volunteers, plus a rebroadcasting facility for [[CBC Radio One]] Northern Ontario from [[CBCS-FM]] [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] on 1340 AM. Most homes subscribe to either Creecable cable TV or a satellite TV service to access any television service, following the 2012 closure of the local [[CBC Television]] and [[TVOntario]] repeaters.\n\n[[Ontera]], formerly Ontario Northland Telecommunications, but now owned by Bell, provides telecommunications service in Moosonee ([[North American Numbering Plan|NPA-NXX]] 705-336).\n\n==Attractions and tourism==\n[[File:Moosonee waterfront.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Waterfront of Moosonee]]\n\nNotable attractions in Moosonee include:\n* Railway Car Museum - displaying the cultural history of the area in an old Baggage Car of the Temiskaming & Northern Ontario Railway.\n* MNR Interpretive Centre - displays and videos at the office of the Ministry of Natural Resources highlighting the wildlife, geological, and geographical features of the region.\n* Excursions to the bird sanctuaries of Shipsands Island and the [[Southern James Bay]].\n\nThe [[Tidewater Provincial Park]] is on the nearby Charles Island, adjacent to Moose Factory Island.\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n\n{{notelist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikivoyage|Moosonee}}\n{{Commons category|Moosonee}}\n* [http://www.moosonee.ca Town of Moosonee official website]\n\n{{Geographic location\n| Center = Moosonee\n| East = [[Factory Island 1, Ontario|Factory Island 1]], [[Unorganized North Cochrane District|Unorganized North Cochrane]]\n| Southeast = [[Moose Factory 68, Ontario|Moose Factory 68]]\n| Southwest = [[Unorganized North Cochrane District|Unorganized North Cochrane]]\n| Northwest = [[Unorganized North Cochrane District|Unorganized North Cochrane]]\n| Northeast = {{flagicon|NU}} [[Baffin, Unorganized|Unorganized Baffin]]<br>''[[James Bay]]''\n}}\n{{Cochrane District}}\n\n[[Category:1903 establishments in Ontario]]\n[[Category:Hudson's Bay Company trading posts]]\n[[Category:Municipalities in Cochrane District]]\n[[Category:Populated coastal places in Canada]]\n[[Category:Road-inaccessible communities of Ontario]]\n[[Category:Single-tier municipalities in Ontario]]\n[[Category:Towns in Ontario]]\n", "name_user": "24.68.2.110", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(added content)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moosonee"}
