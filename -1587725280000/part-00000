{"title_page": "Zanskar", "text_new": "{{Use Indian English|date=December 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2016}}\n{{more footnotes|date=September 2013}}\n[[File:Zanskarmap.jpg|260px|thumb|location map of Zanskar]]\n'''Zanskar''' or '''Zahar''' (locally) or '''Zangskar''' is a subdistrict or [[tehsil]] of the [[Kargil district]], which lies in the [[India]]n union territory of [[Ladakh]]. The administrative centre is [[Padum]]. Zanskar, together with the neighbouring region of [[Ladakh]], was briefly a  part of the kingdom of [[Guge]] in Western Tibet.\n\nThe '''Zanskar Range''' is a [[mountain range]] in the [[Union territory of India|union territory]] of [[Ladakh]] that separates Zanskar from [[Ladakh]]. Geologically, the Zanskar Range is part of the [[Geology of the Himalaya|Tethys Himalaya]], an approximately 100-km-wide synclinorium formed by strongly folded and imbricated, weakly metamorphosed sedimentary series. The average height of the Zanskar Range is about 6,000 m (19,700&nbsp;ft). Its eastern part is known as [[Rupshu]].\n\n==Etymology==\nZanskar ({{lang|zau|\u0f5f\u0f44\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f51\u0f40\u0f62}} ''zangs dkar''\u0f0b) appears as ''\u201cZangskar\u201d'' mostly in academic studies in social sciences ([[anthropology]], [[gender studies]]), reflecting the Ladakhi pronunciation, although the Zanskari pronunciation is Z\u00e3har. Older geographical accounts and maps may use the alternate spelling \"Zaskar\". An etymological study (Snellgrove and Skorupsky, 1980) of the name reveals that its origin might refer to the natural occurrence of [[copper]] in this region, the Tibetan word for which is \"Zangs\". The second syllable however seems to be more challenging as it has various meanings: \"Zangs-dkar\" (white copper), \"Zangs-mkhar\" (copper palace), or \"Zangs-skar\" (copper star). Others claim it derives from ''zan'' = copper + ''skar'' = valley.<ref>Schettler, Margaret & Rolf (1981), p. 150.</ref> Crook (1994) partly shares this interpretation but suggests that the origin of this name might also be \"Zan-mKhar\" (food palace), because the staple food crops are so abundant in an otherwise rather arid region. The locally accepted spelling of the name in Tibetan script is zangs-dkar.\n\nSome of the religious scholars of the district, also cited by Snellgrove and Skorupsky (1980) and Crook (1994), hold that it was originally \"bzang-dkar\", meaning good (or beautiful) and white. \"Good\" would refer to the triangular shape of the Padum plain, the triangle being the symbol of [[Dharma]] and religion; \"white\" would refer to the simplicity, goodness, and religious inclinations of the Zanskaris. Thus, even if etymologically it would be more correct to use \"Zangskar\", the most frequently found spelling for this region is undoubtedly \"Zanskar\".\n\n==Geography==\nZanskar covers an area of some {{convert|7,000|km2|sqmi}}, at an elevation of 3,500-7,135&nbsp;metres (11,500&ndash;23,409&nbsp;feet). It consists of the country lying along the two main branches of the [[Zanskar River]]. The first, the Doda, has its source near the [[Penzi-la]] (4,400&nbsp;m) (14,450&nbsp;ft) mountain-pass, and then flows south-eastwards along the main valley leading towards Padum, the capital of Zanskar.\n[[File:Lake-on-shingo-la.jpg|thumb|Shingo La]]\n\nThe second branch is formed by two main tributaries known as Kargyag river, with its source near the [[Shingo La]] (5,091&nbsp;m) (16,703&nbsp;ft), and Tsarap river, with its source near the Baralacha-La. These two rivers unite below the village of Purney to form the Lungnak river (also known as the Lingti or Tsarap river). The Lungnak river then flows north-westwards along a narrow gorge towards Zanskar's central valley (known locally as jung-khor), where it unites with the Doda river to form the Zanskar river.\n\nFor locals and trekkers alike, the Shingo La is technically one of the easiest 5000m passes in Indian Himalaya, involving no glacier trekking nor steep climbs.\n\n:\"The Shingo La, the main route into Zanskar from Lahaul, is an unpleasant pass. It isn't particularly high, at just 17,000 feet, but it is squalid and sordid and lacks grandeur.\"<ref>Noble (1991), pp. 162\u2013163.</ref>\n[[File:Indus Zanskar confluence.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Zanskar River meeting the [[Indus River|Indus]] ]]\nThe Zanskar river then takes a north-eastern course until it joins the [[Indus River|Indus]] in Ladakh. High mountain ridges lie on both sides of the Doda and Lingti&ndash;kargyag valleys, which run north-west to south-east.  To the south-west is the Great [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] Range which separates Zanskar from the Kisthwar and Chamba basins. To the north-east lies the Zanskar Range, which separates Zanskar from Ladakh. The only outlet for the whole Zanskar hydrographic system is thus the Zanskar river, which cuts the deep and narrow [[Zanskar Gorge]] through the Zanskar range.\n\nThese topographical features explain why access to Zanskar is difficult from all sides. Communication with the neighbouring Himalayan areas is maintained across mountain passes or along the Zanskar river when frozen. The easiest approach leads from [[Kargil town|Kargil]] through the [[Suru valley]] and over the [[Penzi-La]]. It is along this track that in 1979 the only road in Zanskar was built to connect Padum with the main road from Srinagar into Ladakh. One of the first Tibetologists to spend an extended period in the region was [[Alexander Csoma de Koros]],(Hungarian Scholar) who spent over a year living in the region in 1823.  After being integrated into the newly formed state of India in 1947, Zanskar and the neighbouring region of Ladakh were both declared restricted areas and only opened to foreigners in 1974. The first colour film of life in Zanskar was shot in 1958 by an expedition of three British housewives [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/main.jhtml?xml=/education/2008/04/21/st_womenexplorers.xml&page=3].\n\n===Flora and fauna===\nMuch of Zanskar's vegetation is found in the irrigated villages, and on the upper slopes which receive more precipitation and where it consists of alpine and tundra species. Most impressive are the meadows covered with thousands of [[edelweiss]]. At the foot of the [[Gumburanjon]] mountain blue poppies can be found. Crops including barley, lentils, and potatoes are grown by farmers at the lower elevations. Domesticated animals such as the [[yak]], [[dzo]], sheep, horse, and dog are found in the region.\n\nAmong the wildlife that can be found in Zanskar are the [[marmot]], [[bear]], [[wolf]], [[snow leopard]], [[bharal]], alpine [[ibex]], wild sheep and goats, and the [[lammergeier]].\n\n===Climate===\nZanskar is a high altitude semi-desert lying on the Northern flank of the Great Himalayan Range. This mountain range acts as a climatic barrier protecting Ladakh and Zanskar from most of the monsoon, resulting in a pleasantly warm and dry climate in the summer. Rain and snowfall during this period are scarce, although recent decades have shown a trend towards increasing precipitation. Several water-driven mills were built during ancient periods of drought at a great distance from the villages, but have been abandoned because running water is now available nearer to the settlements. Zanskari houses, though otherwise well built, are not adapted to the recently increasing rainfall, as their roofs leak, catching their surprised inhabitants unprepared. Most of the precipitation occurs as snowfall during the harsh and extremely long winter period. These winter snowfalls are of vital importance, since they feed the glaciers which melt in the summer and provide most of the irrigation water. Parts of Zanskar valley are considered some of the coldest continually inhabited places in the world.\n\n==Population==\n[[File:Zanskar alpage col.jpg|thumb|Group of Zanskari women and children]]\nZanskar's population is small, the April 2006 medical census records a population of 13,849 people.  The medical census is the most accurate indicator of population as it collects birth, death, and census information from Zangskar's 22 medical aid centers.  Roughly 95% of the inhabitants practice Tibetan Buddhism, while the remainder are Sunni Muslims, whose ancestors settled in Padum and its environs in the 19th century. The majority of Zanskaris are of mixed [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] and Indo-European origins; notably [[Changpa]], [[Dard people|Dard]] and Mon. The latter are in fact ethnically Dard, but \"Mon\" is used in order to distinguish them from later Dard settlers.\n\nThe population lives mainly in scattered small villages, the largest being the capital [[Padum]], with nearly 700 inhabitants. Most of the villages are located in the valleys of the Zanskar river and its two main tributaries. Given the isolation of this region, the inhabitants tend towards self-sufficiency, and until recently lived in almost complete [[autarky]]. External trade has, however, always been necessary for the acquisition of goods such as [[tool]]s, [[jewellery]], or religious [[Cultural artifact|artefact]]s.\n\nThe Zanskaris' main occupations are cattle-rearing and farming of land that they almost always own. Cultivable land is scarce, and restricted to alluvial fans and terraces, cultivated fields being rarely found above an altitude of 4,000 metres. The Zanskaris have developed a system of intensive arable agriculture and complex irrigation to produce enough food in these conditions. The scarcity of cultivable land has also resulted in a tendency towards a stable, zero-growth population.  An efficient birth-control system in Zanskar has historically been achieved by the common practice of [[polyandry|polyandrous]] marriage, in which several brothers are married to the same wife, and the widespread adoption of a celibate religious life. A high infant mortality rate also contributes to population stability.\n\nIn the summer, the women and children stay far away from the villages to tend to the livestock. This system, known as [[transhumance]], is similar to the one found in the Alps where the animals are sent during the summer higher up in the mountains (the alpages) and were kept by the children and women.\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Chortens col.jpg|thumb|Row of Chorten (or [[Stupa]]) at the village of Purne. Each of the elements that constitute these edifices, as well as their color, has a symbolic meaning in [[Tibetan Buddhism]].]]\nAside from some 300 [[Sunni]] Muslims living in Padum (out of a population of about 700), almost the whole population of Zanskar is Buddhist.<ref>Schettler (1981), p. 169.</ref> However, most of the senior government posts are filled by Muslims of Tehsil centre Padum.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Almost every village has a local monastery, often containing ancient wall-paintings and images. There are two main branches of Tibetan Buddhism here \u2014 the [[Drukpa Lineage|Drugpa]], including  [[Sani Monastery]], [[Dzongkhul]], Stagrimo and [[Bardan Monastery]] - all loosely affiliated with Stakna in the [[Indus valley]]. The [[Gelugpa]] control [[Rangdum Monastery]], [[Karsha]], [[Stongde]] and [[Phugtal Monastery]], which all pay allegiance to the Ngari Rinpoche,<ref>Rizvi (1998), p. 253.</ref> who has his main seat at [[Likir Monastery]] in Ladakh. The present emanation of the Ngari Rinpoche is the younger brother of the Dalai Lama.<ref>Rizvi (1996), pp. 242\u2013242.</ref>\n\n==Livestock==\n[[File:White yack col.jpg|thumb|right|White yak]]\nLivestock, and especially the [[yak]], is of paramount importance in Zanskar. Yaks are used to plough the land, to thresh the grain, to carry heavy loads (up to 200&nbsp;kilograms), and their dung not only serves as fertiliser but is also the only heating fuel available in the region. They are a vital source of milk and sometimes, but rarely, of meat. The yak's fur is used to make clothes, carpets, ropes, and bed covers.\n\n==History==\nThe first traces of human activity in Zanskar seem to go back as far as the [[Bronze Age]]. [[Petroglyph]]s attributed to that period suggest that their creators were hunters on the steppes of central Asia, living between Kazakhstan and China. It is suspected that an Indo-European population known as the [[Mon (Kashmir ethnic group)|Mon]] might then have lived in this region, before mixing with or being replaced by the next settlers, the Dards. Early Buddhism coming from Kashmir spread its influence in Zanskar, possibly as early as 200 BC. The earliest monuments date from the [[Kushan]] period. After this eastward propagation of Buddhism, Zanskar and large parts of the Western Himalaya were overrun in the 7th century by the Tibetans, who imposed their then animistic [[B\u00f6n]] religion.\n[[File:Phugtal col.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Phugtal Monastery]] in south-east Zanskar.]]\n\nBuddhism regained its influence over Zanskar in the 8th century when [[Tibet]] was also converted to this religion. Between the 10th and 11th centuries, two Royal Houses were founded in Zanskar, and the monasteries of Karsha and Phugtal (see picture) were built. Until the 15th century Zanskar existed as a more or less independent Buddhist Kingdom ruled by between two and four related royal families. Since the 15th century, Zanskar has been subordinate to Ladakh, sharing its fortunes and misfortunes. In 1822 a coalition of [[Kullu district|Kulu]], [[Lahoul]], and [[Kinnaur]] invaded Zanskar, plundering the country and destroying the Royal palace at Padum.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, border conflicts between India, Pakistan and China caused Ladakh and Zanskar to be closed to foreigners. During these wars Ladakh lost two thirds of its original territory, losing [[Baltistan]] to Pakistan and the [[Aksai Chin]] to China. Ladakh and Zanskar, despite a tumultuous history of internal wars and external aggressions, have never lost their cultural and religious heritage since the 8th century.  Thanks to its adherence to the Indian Union, this is also one of the rare regions in the Himalaya where traditional Tibetan culture, society, and buildings survived the Chinese [[Cultural Revolution]]. In the last twenty years, the opening of a road and the massive influx of tourists and researchers have brought many changes to the traditional social organisation of Zanskar. In 2007 the valley suffered its third year of a desert locust infestation with many villages losing their crops. The response of the monasteries was to carry out Puja ( prayer ) to get rid of them while the government was advocating the use of insecticides which the Buddhists were reluctant to use, but in some cases were forced to try with as yet undocumented success. In 2008 it was reported that the Locusts had left the central Zanskar plains.\n[[File:Zanskar Lingshed 01.jpg|thumb|[[Lingshed Monastery]]]]\n\n==Tourism==\n[[Tourism]] is probably the major disruption that Zanskar has experienced during recent times. The opening of this region to foreigners has brought benefits such as the financing of schools and the restoration of monasteries and roads, but has also taken its toll on this fragile mountain environment and its population.{{cn|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Languages==\nPeople living in Zanskar speak [[Zanskar Skad language|Zanskar Skad]], and can speak a little bit of mixed [[Hindi]] and [[Urdu]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}, but can't read the same. Monks who have studied outside of Zanskar may know Standard Tibetan. Educated people of Zanskar know [[English language|English]] as it is a compulsory subject in Indian schools.\nZanskari [[zanskar pe skad : \u0f5f\u0f44\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f51\u0f40\u0f62\u0f0b\u0f54\u0f7a\u0f0b\u0f66\u0f90\u0f51\u0f0b]] is a dialect of Ladakhi and has four sub dialects known as Stod skad, Zhung skad, Sham skad and Lungna skad.

This system, known as [[transhumance]], is similar to the one found in the Alps where the animals are sent during the summer higher up in the mountains (the alpages) and were kept by the children and women.\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Chortens col.jpg|thumb|Row of Chorten (or [[Stupa]]) at the village of Purne. Each of the elements that constitute these edifices, as well as their color, has a symbolic meaning in [[Tibetan Buddhism]].]]\nAside from some 300 [[Sunni]] Muslims living in Padum (out of a population of about 700), almost the whole population of Zanskar is Buddhist.<ref>Schettler (1981), p. 169.</ref> However, most of the senior government posts are filled by Muslims of Tehsil centre Padum.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Almost every village has a local monastery, often containing ancient wall-paintings and images. There are two main branches of Tibetan Buddhism here \u2014 the [[Drukpa Lineage|Drugpa]], including  [[Sani Monastery]], [[Dzongkhul]], Stagrimo and [[Bardan Monastery]] - all loosely affiliated with Stakna in the [[Indus valley]]. The [[Gelugpa]] control [[Rangdum Monastery]], [[Karsha]], [[Stongde]] and [[Phugtal Monastery]], which all pay allegiance to the Ngari Rinpoche,<ref>Rizvi (1998), p. 253.</ref> who has his main seat at [[Likir Monastery]] in Ladakh. The present emanation of the Ngari Rinpoche is the younger brother of the Dalai Lama.<ref>Rizvi (1996), pp. 242\u2013242.</ref>\n\n==Livestock==\n[[File:White yack col.jpg|thumb|right|White yak]]\nLivestock, and especially the [[yak]], is of paramount importance in Zanskar. Yaks are used to plough the land, to thresh the grain, to carry heavy loads (up to 200&nbsp;kilograms), and their dung not only serves as fertiliser but is also the only heating fuel available in the region. They are a vital source of milk and sometimes, but rarely, of meat. The yak's fur is used to make clothes, carpets, ropes, and bed covers.\n\n==History==\nThe first traces of human activity in Zanskar seem to go back as far as the [[Bronze Age]]. [[Petroglyph]]s attributed to that period suggest that their creators were hunters on the steppes of central Asia, living between Kazakhstan and China. It is suspected that an Indo-European population known as the [[Mon (Kashmir ethnic group)|Mon]] might then have lived in this region, before mixing with or being replaced by the next settlers, the Dards. Early Buddhism coming from Kashmir spread its influence in Zanskar, possibly as early as 200 BC. The earliest monuments date from the [[Kushan]] period. After this eastward propagation of Buddhism, Zanskar and large parts of the Western Himalaya were overrun in the 7th century by the Tibetans, who imposed their then animistic [[B\u00f6n]] religion.\n[[File:Phugtal col.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Phugtal Monastery]] in south-east Zanskar.]]\n\nBuddhism regained its influence over Zanskar in the 8th century when [[Tibet]] was also converted to this religion. Between the 10th and 11th centuries, two Royal Houses were founded in Zanskar, and the monasteries of Karsha and Phugtal (see picture) were built. Until the 15th century Zanskar existed as a more or less independent Buddhist Kingdom ruled by between two and four related royal families. Since the 15th century, Zanskar has been subordinate to Ladakh, sharing its fortunes and misfortunes. In 1822 a coalition of [[Kullu district|Kulu]], [[Lahoul]], and [[Kinnaur]] invaded Zanskar, plundering the country and destroying the Royal palace at Padum.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, border conflicts between India, Pakistan and China caused Ladakh and Zanskar to be closed to foreigners. During these wars Ladakh lost two thirds of its original territory, losing [[Baltistan]] to Pakistan and the [[Aksai Chin]] to China. Ladakh and Zanskar, despite a tumultuous history of internal wars and external aggressions, have never lost their cultural and religious heritage since the 8th century.  Thanks to its adherence to the Indian Union, this is also one of the rare regions in the Himalaya where traditional Tibetan culture, society, and buildings survived the Chinese [[Cultural Revolution]]. In the last twenty years, the opening of a road and the massive influx of tourists and researchers have brought many changes to the traditional social organisation of Zanskar. In 2007 the valley suffered its third year of a desert locust infestation with many villages losing their crops. The response of the monasteries was to carry out Puja ( prayer ) to get rid of them while the government was advocating the use of insecticides which the Buddhists were reluctant to use, but in some cases were forced to try with as yet undocumented success. In 2008 it was reported that the Locusts had left the central Zanskar plains.\n[[File:Zanskar Lingshed 01.jpg|thumb|[[Lingshed Monastery]]]]\n\n==Tourism==\n[[Tourism]] is probably the major disruption that Zanskar has experienced during recent times. The opening of this region to foreigners has brought benefits such as the financing of schools and the restoration of monasteries and roads, but has also taken its toll on this fragile mountain environment and its population.{{cn|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Languages==\nPeople living in Zanskar speak [[Zanskar Skad language|Zanskar Skad]], and can speak a little bit of mixed [[Hindi]] and [[Urdu]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}, but can't read the same. Monks who have studied outside of Zanskar may know Standard Tibetan. Educated people of Zanskar know [[English language|English]] as it is a compulsory subject in Indian schools.\nZanskari [[zanskar pe skad : \u0f5f\u0f44\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f51\u0f40\u0f62\u0f0b\u0f54\u0f7a\u0f0b\u0f66\u0f90\u0f51\u0f0b]] is a dialect of Ladakhi and has four sub dialects known as Stod skad, Zhung skad, Sham skad and Lungna skad.

Vext was a local buzz band, playing shows at [[CBGB]], The Continental, and Lamours. They also opened for [[Biohazard (band)|Biohazard]], [[Candiria]] and many others. In 2005, at the [[Roadrunner Records]] 25th-anniversary show, Vext was invited to sing with [[Corey Taylor]] of [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]].<ref>{{Citation|last=|first=|title=Roadrunner United Corey Taylor and Tommy Vext Singing|date=2008-12-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNBdBNS_Clo|volume=|pages=|access-date=2018-09-07}}</ref>\n\n=== Divine Heresy<ref name=\":0\" />===\nIn 2006, Vext was recruited by [[Dino Cazares]] of [[Fear Factory]] to front his new band [[Divine Heresy]].

It followed the [[1913 Auckland Rugby League season]] where [[North Shore Albions]] were crowned senior champions for the first time. The senior grade saw the addition of [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]], who had previously competed in the lower grades only, and [[Grafton Athletic]]. The [[Manukau Magpies|Manukau Rovers]] and [[Eden Ramblers]] no longer contributed teams. The first grade was won once again by [[North Shore Albions]].\n\nAt a meeting of [[Auckland Rugby League]] on 9 May it was decided that the proceeds of ticket sales at club games would be split 50\u201350 between the teams and [[Auckland Rugby League]].<ref>{{cite news|url= https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140511.2.8.1|title=FOOTBALL.

The worst case being in the Round 9 match where [[Newton Rangers]] could only field eight players, with two spectators from the crowd later joining them as they were defeated by 43 points to 2 by [[North Shore Albions]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nNear the conclusion of the season a match was played at [[Victoria Park, New Zealand|Victoria Park]] between a team of veterans and Auckland colts on 29 August. It raised \u00a327 and 10 shillings for the Patriotic Fund. Also a \"Patriotic Carnival\" was held on 5 September. A fancy dress carnival paraded around town with Highland pipers and a brass band. It proceeded to the [[Auckland Domain]] where a 3rd grade match was being played between Remuera and [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] 3rd Grade teams, and a \u2018Burlesque\u2019 football game was then played. Finally a match was played between the North Island Jockeys and [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] 3rd grade team which the jockey's won 11\u20136. \u00a349 was raised for the Patriotic Fund.<ref>{{cite news \n| title = Fancy Dress Carnival\n| page =8\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LI| issue=15707\n| date = 1914-09-07\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140907.2.86.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-12}}</ref>\n\n==Lower Grade Clubs==\nTeams which fielded sides in lower grades were the [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote Ramblers]], Hobsonville Pirates, Sunnyside (on the North Shore), Remuera and [[Manukau Magpies|Manukau]].\n\n==Representative Season==\nThe [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] representative campaign got underway with a match versus the touring [[England rugby league team|England]] team where the home side lost.

The newspapers did not bother recording the point scorers though they did mention that the Shore side gave everybody in the team a chance to kick for goal.\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 11 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = 5\u20132\n| report =<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Ponsonby Defeats City/Wins for North Shore and Grafton\n| page = 10\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LI| issue=15659\n| date = 1914-07-13\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140713.2.133.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-11}}</ref>| away = City\n| try1 = [[Jim Clark (rugby league)|Jim Clark]]\n| con1 =\n| pen1 = [[Charles Webb (rugby league)|Charles Webb]] (mark)\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = [[Ernie Asher]]\n| stadium = Victoria Park\n| attendance = 4000\n| referee = A Ferguson\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 11 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Otahuhu\n| score = 8\u201317\n| report =<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grafton V Otahuhu\n| page = 10\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LI| issue=15659\n| date = 1914-07-13\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140713.2.133.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-11}}</ref>| away = Grafton\n| try1 = George Cook, [[Arthur Hardgrave]]\n| con1 =\n| pen1 = M Stanaway\n| try2 = [[Bob Mitchell (rugby league)|Bob Mitchell]], [[Karl Ifwersen]] 2\n| con2 = [[Karl Ifwersen]] 3\n| pen2 = [[Karl Ifwersen]]\n| stadium = Otahuhu\n| attendance =\n| referee = Tyson\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 11 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = North Shore\n| score = 43\u20132\n| report =<ref>{{cite news\n| title = North Shore V Newton\n| page = 10\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LI| issue=15659\n| date = 1914-07-13\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140713.2.133.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-11}}</ref>| away = Newton\n| try1 = unknown x ?\n| con1 = unknown x ?\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = unknown x 1\n| stadium = Auckland Domain\n| attendance =\n| referee = Benson\n}}\n\n===Final===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 18 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = 2\u201313\n| report =<ref>{{cite news\n| title =The Championship Final/Won by North Shore/A Record Attendance\n| page = 4\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LI| issue=15665\n| date = 1914-07-20\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140720.2.10.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-11}}</ref>| away = North Shore\n| try1 =\n| con1 =\n| pen1 = [[Charles Webb (rugby league)|Charles Webb]]\n| try2 =Wynyard, Edward Fox, [[Stan Weston]]\n| con2 = Jack Paul 2\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Victoria Park\n| attendance = 7000\n| referee = R Benson\n}}\n\n===Top Try Scorers and Point Scorers===\nNone of the North Shore point scorers from their farcical Round 9 match with Newton Rangers were credited and therefore the following lists will be inaccurate as 43 points were scored by them.

Sligo is also a tourist destination, being situated on the [[Wild Atlantic Way]], with many literary and cultural associations.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Sligo}}\n\n===Etymology===\nSligo is the anglicisation of the Irish name ''Sligeach'', meaning \"abounding in shells\" or \"shelly place\". It refers to the abundance of [[shellfish]] found in the river and its estuary, and from the extensive [[Shell middens|shell middens]] in the vicinity.<ref>Wood-Martin's History of Sligo, 1882</ref><ref name=SBC>\n{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.sligoborough.ie/asp/AboutUs/HistorySligo.asp\n |title       = History of Sligo\n |accessdate  = 13 May 2008\n |work        = Sligo Borough Council \u2013 About Us\n |quote       = The scallop shells [...] were once abundant in the estuary at the mouth of the Garavogue \u2013 a river once known as the 'Sligeach', or 'shelly place', giving Sligo its name\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070610051333/http://www.sligoborough.ie/asp/AboutUs/HistorySligo.asp\n |archivedate = 10 June 2007\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> The river now known as the Garavogue (Irish: An Gharbh\u00f3g) meaning \"little rough one\" was originally called the Sligeach.<ref name=Origins>{{cite web|title=Origins of Sligo/Slicech/Sligeach|date=10 November 2009|url=http://www.sligoheritage.com/archsligeach.htm|website=Sligo Heritage|accessdate=1 December 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611171542/http://www.sligoheritage.com/archsligeach.htm|archivedate=11 June 2017}}</ref> It is listed as one of the seven \"royal rivers\" of Ireland in the 9th century AD tale ''[[Togail Bruidne D\u00e1 Derga|The Destruction of Da Dergas Hostel]]''. The river ''Slicech'' is also referenced in the Annals of Ulster in 1188.<ref name=Origins/>\n\nThe [[Ordnance Survey]] letters of 1836 state that \"cart loads of shells were found underground in many places within the town where houses now stand\". The whole area, from the river estuary at Sligo, around the coast to the river at [[Ballysadare]] Bay, is rich in marine resources which were utilised as far back as the [[Mesolithic]] period.\n\n===Early history===\nThe importance of Sligo's location in [[prehistory]] is demonstrated by the abundance of ancient sites close by and even within the town. For example, Sligo town's first roundabout was constructed around a megalithic [[passage tomb]] at Abbeyquarter North in Garavogue Villas.<ref name=Bergh>\n{{cite book\n| last             = Bergh\n| first            = Stefan\n| title            = Landscape of the monuments.

The area around Sligo town has one of the highest densities of prehistoric archaeological sites in Ireland. It is the only place in which all classes of Irish megalithic monuments are to be found together. [[Knocknarea]] mountain, capped by the great cairn of [[Miosg\u00e1n M\u00e9dhbh|Miosgan Maeve]], dominates the skyline to the west of the town. Cairns Hill on the southern edge of the town also has two very large stone cairns.\n\nExcavations for the [[National Roads Authority|NRA]] for the N4 Sligo Inner Relief Road in 2002 revealed a [[Bronze Age]] [[Henge]] at Tonafortes (beside the Carraroe roundabout) on the southern outskirts of the town, and an early [[Neolithic]] [[causewayed enclosure]] (c. 4000 B.C.) at Maugheraboy on high ground overlooking the town from the south.

By the 12th century there was a bridge and small settlement in existence at the site of the present town.\n\n===Medieval history===\nThe [[Norman people|Norman]] knight [[Maurice Fitzgerald, Baron of Offaly|Maurice Fitzgerald]], the [[Lord Chief Justice of Ireland]], is generally credited with the establishment of the medieval European-style town and port of Sligo, building [[Sligo Castle]] in [[1245 in Ireland|1245]]. The [[Irish annals|annalists]] refer to the town as a ''sraidbhaile'' ('street settlement') which seems to have consisted of the castle and an attached defensive [[bawn]] in the vicinity of Quay street. A [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Friary (Blackfriars) was also founded by Maurice Fitzgerald and the King of Connacht [[Felim mac Cathal Crobderg Ua Conchobair]] in 1253. This was accidentally destroyed by fire in 1414, and was subsequently rebuilt in its present form by Tighernan O\u2019Rourke. Norman hegemony was, however, not destined to last long in Sligo. The Norman advance was halted in Sligo after the battle of [[Creadran-Cille|Credran Cille]] in 1257 at Ros Ceite ([[Rosses Point]]) between [[:s:O'Donnell, Godfrey (DNB00)|Godfrey O'Donnell]], Lord of [[Tirconnell]], and Maurice Fitzgerald. Both commanders were mortally wounded in single combat. The Norman invasion of T\u00edr Chonaill was abandoned after this. In 1289 a survey indicates there were 180 [[Burgess (title)|burgesses]] in the town. The Normans had laid a foundation that was to last.\n\nThe town is unique in Ireland in that it is the only Norman-founded Irish town to have been under almost continuous native Irish control throughout the Medieval period. Despite Anglo-Norman attempts to retake it, it became the administrative centre of the O' Conor Sligo ([[\u00d3 Conchobhair Sligigh|O'Conchobar Sligigh]]) confederation of [[\u00cdochtar Connacht|Iochtar Connacht]] (Lower Connacht) by 1315 AD. Also called Clan Aindrias, the O 'Conors were a branch of the O' Conchobar dynasty of [[Kings of Connacht]]. It continued to develop within the [[t\u00faath]] (Irish territory) of [[Cairbre Drom Cliabh]] becoming the effective centre of the confederation of t\u00faatha. The other Irish t\u00faatha subject to here were [[T\u00edr Fh\u00edacrach M\u00faaidhe]], [[Luighne Connacht]], [[Tir Oll\u00edol|Tir Olliol]] and [[Corann]]. Throughout this time Sligo was under the system of [[Early Irish law|F\u00e9nechus]] (Brehon) law and was ruled by the Gaelic system of an elected [[R\u00ed]] t\u00faath (territory king/lord), and an assembly known as an oireacht.\n\nThrough competition between Gaelic dynasties for the lucrative port duties of Sligo, the town was burned, sacked or besieged approximately 49 times during the medieval period, according to the annals of Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://celt.ucc.ie/published/T100005A/ |title=Annals of the Four Masters |publisher=Celt.ucc.ie |date= |accessdate=2019-11-15}}</ref> These raids seem to have had little effect on the development of the town, as by the mid 15th century the town and port had grown in importance. It traded with Galway, [[Bristol]], France and Spain. Amongst the earliest preserved specimens of written English in Connacht is a receipt for 20 marks, dated August 1430, paid by Saunder Lynche and Davy Botyller, to Henry Blake and Walter Blake, customers of \"ye King and John Rede, controller of ye porte of Galvy and of Slego\".\n\nSligo continued under Gaelic control until the late 16th century when, during the Elizabethan conquest, it was selected as the county town for the newly shired County of Sligo. An order was sent by the Elizabethan Government to [[Sir Nicholas Malby]], Knight, wanting him to establish \"apt and safe\" places for the keeping of the Assizes & Sessions, with walls of lime & stone, in each county of Connacht, \"judging that the aptest place be in Sligo, for the County of Sligo\u2026\"<ref name=wood-m>\n{{cite book\n| last            = Wood-Martin\n| first           = W.G.\n| title           = History of Sligo, County and Town.

This territory corresponds closely to the newly created Sligo Borough District.\n\nSligo town then became an incorporated municipal borough with a [[Royal charter]] issued by the British [[King James I of England|King James I]] in 1613/14. See [[High Sheriff of Sligo]]. It had the right to elect 12 burgesses to the corporation.\n\nOn 1 June 2014 the old Borough Council was dissolved and administration of the town was amalgamated with the County Council. Sligo is now part of an expanded municipal borough district extending from [[Collooney]] to the border with [[County Leitrim]] at [[Tullaghan]] and containing a population of around 40,000. It elects 10 councillors of 18 in total to Sligo County Council.\n\nSligo has had a mayor since incorporation in 1613. With the re-organisation of local government in 2014 the title has been restyled as Mayor of the Municipal District and is elected by the ten councillors elected for the Sligo Municipal District.\n\n===Law enforcement===\n[[File:SligoCourtHouse.JPG|thumb|upright|Sligo courthouse]]\nFrom its foundation in the 13th century Sligo was administered under local [[Early Irish law|F\u00e9nechus]] (Brehon law) until the establishment of [[Common law|English Common law]] in the early 17th century after the battle of Kinsale. Courts were held regularly throughout the [[tuath]] at various buildings and on hilltops reserved for the purpose. Law enforcement was a function of the nobility and freemen of the area as no police force existed. No records survive from these early courts, but a case is recorded of a Dublin merchant being reimbursed by the local courts after he was fraudulently sold an out of date poem in the 1540s.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eqdnAAAAMAAJ|title=Power, Politics, and Land: Early Modern Sligo, 1568\u20131688|first=Mary|last=O'Dowd|date=2 May 1991|publisher=Institute of Irish Studies, Queen's University of Belfast|accessdate=2 May 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9780853894049}}</ref> Sligo then came under English martial law and eventually the common law as administered from Dublin and from which descends the present system.\n\nThe modern [[Sligo Courthouse]] was built in 1878.

The harbour can accommodate ships with a maximum draft of 5.2 metres and length of 100 metres, The Port of Sligo extends from the Timber Jetty at Hyde Road Bridge for a distance of 1.3&nbsp;km. Sligo County Council took over responsibility for Sligo Harbour from Sligo Harbour Commissioners in June 2006.\n\nRecords first show the development of Sligo's port as a port of consequence for agricultural goods to Britain and Europe in the 13th century with the arrival of the Normans. As a port under Gaelic lords, much of the fighting about Sligo was for control of the \"[[cocket]]\" of Sligo port. Merchant families set up trade under this system with the O'Creans wine importers being the most well known. They had contacts in France, Spain and Portugal.\n\nOfficial English records in the fifteenth century mention \u2018Fish Quay\u2019 under [[King Henry VI of England|King Henry VI]] reign. Customs duties under the Harbour Commissioners can be traced back to [[King George II of England|George II]]. At that time and for two hundred years thereafter, Sligo was the most important port in the northwest.<ref>Sligo County Council, 2008</ref>{{nonspecific|date=March 2020}}\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, the port was used for the transit of significant quantities of cattle, hides, butter, barley, oats, and oatmeal being exported and with the city's linen exports well established. Imports included wood, iron, maize and coal. The town prospered due to the trade with wealthy merchants setting up homes along the then fashionable Castle Street and Radcliffe Street (later renamed Grattan Street).

The whole area, from the river estuary at Sligo, around the coast to the river at [[Ballysadare]] Bay, is rich in marine resources which were utilised as far back as the [[Mesolithic]] period.\n\n===Early history===\nThe importance of Sligo's location in [[prehistory]] is demonstrated by the abundance of ancient sites close by and even within the town.

Cairns Hill on the southern edge of the town also has two very large stone cairns.\n\nExcavations for the [[National Roads Authority|NRA]] for the N4 Sligo Inner Relief Road in 2002 revealed a [[Bronze Age]] [[Henge]] at Tonafortes (beside the Carraroe roundabout) on the southern outskirts of the town, and an early [[Neolithic]] [[causewayed enclosure]] (c. 4000 B.C.) at Maugheraboy on high ground overlooking the town from the south.

By the 12th century there was a bridge and small settlement in existence at the site of the present town.\n\n===Medieval history===\nThe [[Norman people|Norman]] knight [[Maurice Fitzgerald, Baron of Offaly|Maurice Fitzgerald]], the [[Lord Chief Justice of Ireland]], is generally credited with the establishment of the medieval European-style town and port of Sligo, building [[Sligo Castle]] in [[1245 in Ireland|1245]]. The [[Irish annals|annalists]] refer to the town as a ''sraidbhaile'' ('street settlement') which seems to have consisted of the castle and an attached defensive [[bawn]] in the vicinity of Quay street. A [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Friary (Blackfriars) was also founded by Maurice Fitzgerald and the King of Connacht [[Felim mac Cathal Crobderg Ua Conchobair]] in 1253. This was accidentally destroyed by fire in 1414, and was subsequently rebuilt in its present form by Tighernan O\u2019Rourke. Norman hegemony was, however, not destined to last long in Sligo. The Norman advance was halted in Sligo after the battle of [[Creadran-Cille|Credran Cille]] in 1257 at Ros Ceite ([[Rosses Point]]) between [[:s:O'Donnell, Godfrey (DNB00)|Godfrey O'Donnell]], Lord of [[Tirconnell]], and Maurice Fitzgerald. Both commanders were mortally wounded in single combat. The Norman invasion of T\u00edr Chonaill was abandoned after this. In 1289 a survey indicates there were 180 [[Burgess (title)|burgesses]] in the town. The Normans had laid a foundation that was to last.\n\nThe town is unique in Ireland in that it is the only Norman-founded Irish town to have been under almost continuous native Irish control throughout the Medieval period. Despite Anglo-Norman attempts to retake it, it became the administrative centre of the O' Conor Sligo ([[\u00d3 Conchobhair Sligigh|O'Conchobar Sligigh]]) confederation of [[\u00cdochtar Connacht|Iochtar Connacht]] (Lower Connacht) by 1315 AD. Also called Clan Aindrias, the O 'Conors were a branch of the O' Conchobar dynasty of [[Kings of Connacht]]. It continued to develop within the [[t\u00faath]] (Irish territory) of [[Cairbre Drom Cliabh]] becoming the effective centre of the confederation of t\u00faatha. The other Irish t\u00faatha subject to here were [[T\u00edr Fh\u00edacrach M\u00faaidhe]], [[Luighne Connacht]], [[Tir Oll\u00edol|Tir Olliol]] and [[Corann]]. Throughout this time Sligo was under the system of [[Early Irish law|F\u00e9nechus]] (Brehon) law and was ruled by the Gaelic system of an elected [[R\u00ed]] t\u00faath (territory king/lord), and an assembly known as an oireacht.\n\nThrough competition between Gaelic dynasties for the lucrative port duties of Sligo, the town was burned, sacked or besieged approximately 49 times during the medieval period, according to the annals of Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://celt.ucc.ie/published/T100005A/ |title=Annals of the Four Masters |publisher=Celt.ucc.ie |date= |accessdate=2019-11-15}}</ref> These raids seem to have had little effect on the development of the town, as by the mid 15th century the town and port had grown in importance. It traded with Galway, [[Bristol]], France and Spain. Amongst the earliest preserved specimens of written English in Connacht is a receipt for 20 marks, dated August 1430, paid by Saunder Lynche and Davy Botyller, to Henry Blake and Walter Blake, customers of \"ye King and John Rede, controller of ye porte of Galvy and of Slego\".\n\nSligo continued under Gaelic control until the late 16th century when, during the Elizabethan conquest, it was selected as the county town for the newly shired County of Sligo. An order was sent by the Elizabethan Government to [[Sir Nicholas Malby]], Knight, wanting him to establish \"apt and safe\" places for the keeping of the Assizes & Sessions, with walls of lime & stone, in each county of Connacht, \"judging that the aptest place be in Sligo, for the County of Sligo\u2026\"<ref name=wood-m>\n{{cite book\n| last            = Wood-Martin\n| first           = W.G.\n| title           = History of Sligo, County and Town.

This resulted in two major strikes, in 1912 and, in 1913 the prolonged [[1913 Sligo Dock strike|Sligo dock strike]]. Both ended in victory for the workers.\n\nSligo town was heavily garrisoned by the [[British Army]] during the War of Independence. For this reason IRA activity was limited to actions such as harassment, sabotage and jailbreaks. At various times during the war prominent Republicans were held at the [[Sligo Gaol]]. The commander of IRA forces in Sligo was [[Liam Pilkington]].\n\nArthur Griffith spoke in April 1922 on the corner of O' Connell St. and Grattan St. To this day it is known as Griffiths corner.\nDuring the Civil war, Sligo railway station was blown up by Anti-Treaty forces on 10 January 1923.\n\nIn 1961 [[St John the Baptist Cathedral, Sligo|St. John the Baptist's Church]] became a cathedral of the [[Diocese of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh]] after St. Mary's Cathedral in Elphin was abandoned, being destroyed by a storm four years previously.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:North Sligo Town.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Sligo]]\nSituated on a coastal plain facing the Atlantic Ocean, Sligo is located on low gravel hills on the banks of the [[Garavogue River]] between [[Lough Gill]] and the estuary of the Garavogue river leading to [[Sligo Bay]]. The town is surrounded on three sides by an arc of mountains, with the Ox Mountain ridges of Slieve Daeane and Killery Mountain to the southeast bordering Lough Gill. The flat topped limestone plateaux of Cope's, Keelogyboy and Castlegal Mountains to the north and northeast and the singular hill of [[Knocknarea]] with its Neolithic cairn to the west and the distinctive high plateau of [[Benbulben]] to the north.\n\nSligo is an important bridging point on the main north/south route between [[Ulster]] and [[Connacht]]. It is the county town of [[County Sligo]] and is in the Barony of [[Carbury, County Sligo|Carbury]] (formerly the Gaelic [[tuath]] of [[Cairbre Drom Cliabh]]). Sligo is the diocesan seat of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Elphin]]. It is in the Church of Ireland [[Diocese of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh]].\n\nCounty Sligo is one of the counties of the province of [[Connacht]]. It is part of the [[Border Region]], a region of over 500,000 people which also comprises the counties of [[County Cavan|Cavan]], [[County Donegal|Donegal]], [[County Leitrim|Leitrim]], [[County Louth|Louth]] and [[County Monaghan|Monaghan]].<ref name=WDC>\n{{cite web\n| url              = http://www.wdc.ie/countyprofiles_sligo.html\n| title            = County Profiles \u2013 Sligo\n| accessdate       = 13 May 2008\n| work             = Western Development Commission\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071118174420/http://www.wdc.ie/countyprofiles_sligo.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 18 November 2007}}\n</ref>\n\n===Architecture===\nThe town consists of a medieval core with mainly 19th century buildings many of which are of architectural merit.<ref name=\"amazonaws1\">{{cite web|url=https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/assets.ria.ie/ihta/ihta-digital/anglo-norman-towns/sligo/IHTA_24_Sligo_Text.pdf|title=Topographical information.

Here it meets the east west road leading from the Abbeyquarter on the east side to St. Johns Cathedral to the west. This seems to have been the first street laid out in the town. Burgage plots of Norman origin are also evident in the long narrow property boundaries typical of the centre of the town.<ref name=\"amazonaws1\"/>\n\nThe only surviving medieval building is the abbey, the Holy Cross Dominican Friary built in 1252. An arched tower and three sided cloister of the Abbey Church still survive. The next oldest extant building is the Cathedral of St Mary the Virgin and St. John the Baptist on John Street. The current building dates from 1730 when it was designed by the German architect [[Richard Cassels]] who was visiting to design [[Hazelwood House, Sligo|Hazelwood House]]. The cathedral contains four memorials to the Pollexfen family, maternal relatives of [[W. B.

These include Sligo Town Hall, designed by William Hague in a [[Lombard Romanesque|Lombardo-Romanesque]] style. [[Sligo Courthouse]] on Teeling street is an asymmetrical Neo-Gothic building designed by Rawson Carroll and built in 1878. The Gilooly Memorial Hall is an austere building on Temple Street built as a memorial to the [[Temperance movement|Temperance]] campaigner Bishop Gillooly. His statue above the door bears the inscription \"Ireland sober, is Ireland free\". The Model School, now the [[Model Arts and Niland Gallery|Model Arts & Niland Gallery]], was built by James Owen of the Board of Works to provide education to all denominations between 1857 and 1863, it was to serve as a model for other schools throughout the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiseek.com/2009/2000-model-arts-and-niland-gallery-sligo-co-sligo/ |title=2000 \u2013 Model Arts and Niland Gallery, Sligo, Co.

Law enforcement was a function of the nobility and freemen of the area as no police force existed. No records survive from these early courts, but a case is recorded of a Dublin merchant being reimbursed by the local courts after he was fraudulently sold an out of date poem in the 1540s.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eqdnAAAAMAAJ|title=Power, Politics, and Land: Early Modern Sligo, 1568\u20131688|first=Mary|last=O'Dowd|date=2 May 1991|publisher=Institute of Irish Studies, Queen's University of Belfast|accessdate=2 May 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9780853894049}}</ref> Sligo then came under English martial law and eventually the common law as administered from Dublin and from which descends the present system.\n\nThe modern [[Sligo Courthouse]] was built in 1878.

The two main hospitals are [[Sligo University Hospital]] (formerly General and Regional) and St. John's Hospital. There is also a private hospital at Garden Hill.\n\n==Education==\n{{See also|Education in the Republic of Ireland}}\n\nAs of 2011, 16.9 per cent of adults were educated to at most primary level only; a further 52.0 per cent attained second level while 31.2 per cent were educated to third level. \n\nThere are four main secondary schools in Sligo.

The section of the N4 road between Sligo and Collooney is a dual carriageway. The first phase of this road was completed in January 1998, bypassing the towns of [[Collooney]] and [[Ballysadare]]. An extension to this road was completed in September 2005, and is known as the Sligo Inner Relief Road.\n\nO'Connell Street \u2013 the main street in the town \u2013 was pedestrianised on 15 August 2006. Plans for the proposed redevelopment and paving of this street were publicly unveiled on 23 July 2008 in ''The Sligo Champion''. The newspaper later revealed that people were not in favour of the pedestrianisation of the street.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} The street was reopened to traffic in December 2009.\n\nSligo has a certain amount of cycleways in proximity to the town and various road traffic calming measures have been installed helping to improve safety for pedestrians and cyclists.

The harbour can accommodate ships with a maximum draft of 5.2 metres and length of 100 metres, The Port of Sligo extends from the Timber Jetty at Hyde Road Bridge for a distance of 1.3&nbsp;km. Sligo County Council took over responsibility for Sligo Harbour from Sligo Harbour Commissioners in June 2006.\n\nRecords first show the development of Sligo's port as a port of consequence for agricultural goods to Britain and Europe in the 13th century with the arrival of the Normans. As a port under Gaelic lords, much of the fighting about Sligo was for control of the \"[[cocket]]\" of Sligo port. Merchant families set up trade under this system with the O'Creans wine importers being the most well known. They had contacts in France, Spain and Portugal.\n\nOfficial English records in the fifteenth century mention \u2018Fish Quay\u2019 under [[King Henry VI of England|King Henry VI]] reign. Customs duties under the Harbour Commissioners can be traced back to [[King George II of England|George II]]. At that time and for two hundred years thereafter, Sligo was the most important port in the northwest.<ref>Sligo County Council, 2008</ref>{{nonspecific|date=March 2020}}\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, the port was used for the transit of significant quantities of cattle, hides, butter, barley, oats, and oatmeal being exported and with the city's linen exports well established. Imports included wood, iron, maize and coal. The town prospered due to the trade with wealthy merchants setting up homes along the then fashionable Castle Street and Radcliffe Street (later renamed Grattan Street). This wealth is demonstrated by the Cathedral of John the Baptist, which was completed as early as 1730, to designs by [[Richard Cassels]].\n\nDuring the time of the Great Famine, around 1847\u20131850, it is estimated that more than 30,000 people emigrated through Sligo Port, mainly to Canada and the United States.\n\nThe most notable ship companies to operate out of Sligo included Sligo Steam Navigation Company who introduced the first steamer in 1857, Messrs Middleton & Pollexfen, Harper Cambell Ltd and the former Sligo Harbour Commissioners who owned a number of dredgers used for maintenance of the Channel (McTernan, 1992).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.environ.ie/en/Foreshore/ApplicationsandDeterminations/SligoCountyCouncil/ApplicationsDetails/FileDownLoad,32814,en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 October 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006165015/http://www.environ.ie/en/Foreshore/ApplicationsandDeterminations/SligoCountyCouncil/ApplicationsDetails/FileDownLoad,32814,en.pdf |archivedate=6 October 2014  }}</ref>\n\nThe [[1913 Sligo Dock strike]] lasted for 56 days and was a precursor to the [[Dublin Lockout]] that occurred 6 months later.

She enjoyed considerable success in Japan in the early 1990s. The three solo hits were: \"[[Just Another Dream]]\" (UK No. 13, US No. 9, Australia No. 14), which featured D Mob on [[backing vocals]];<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> a cover of the Wish and [[Fonda Rae]] 1984 [[Nightclub|club]] hit \"[[Touch Me (All Night Long)#Cathy Dennis version|Touch Me (All Night Long)]]\" (UK No. 5, US No. 2, Australia No. 16), which is probably her most remembered hit to date;<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> and \"[[Too Many Walls]]\" (UK No. 17, US No. 8, Australia No. 57).\n\nSubsequent releases were only minor hits. Her final Top 40 hit in the US was \"You Lied to Me\" in 1992, taken from her second album ''[[Into the Skyline]]'',<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> and her final Top 40 hit in the UK was a cover of the ''[[Kinks]]''' classic \"[[Waterloo Sunset]]\", which made No. 11 during 1997. That same year, her last solo single, \"When Your Dreams Turn to Dust\", peaked in the UK at No. 43. These two latter singles were both taken from her third and last solo album, ''[[Am I the Kinda Girl?]]'',<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> also including a third single, \"West End Pad\", the album opening track (UK No. 25).\n\n\"Touch Me (All Night Long)\" stayed at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks, and was kept out of the No. 1 spot by [[Hi-Five]]'s \"I Like The Way (The Kissing Game)\" in the first week, and [[Mariah Carey]]'s \"[[I Don't Wanna Cry]]\" in the second week. The song was a [[cover version|cover]] and lyrical reworking of a 1984 single by Wish featuring Fonda Rae, which had peaked at No. 70 on the US [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] chart that year. \"Touch Me (All Night Long)\" reached No. 1 on the US [[Hot Dance Club Play]] chart, and its follow-up, \"Too Many Walls\", which Dennis co-wrote with [[Anne Dudley]] of [[Art of Noise]] (who also co-wrote the [[ABC (band)|ABC]] track \"All of My Heart\"), was a No. 1 [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] hit in the United States. It was around this time Dennis agreed to join [[Club MTV]]'s first tour, booked for six weeks. She dropped out on the third date, later publicly accusing one of [[Milli Vanilli]]'s members (the tour's headline act) of sexual harassment. During this period, she recorded a song called \"Find the Key to Your Life\" with [[David Morales]], for the [[soundtrack]] to the movie ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze]]''.\n\nDennis released her second album, ''[[Into the Skyline]]'', in September 1992, written with an aim toward the US market. The album featured the singles \"You Lied to Me\", \"Irresistible\", \"Moments of Love,\" \"Falling\", and \"Why\" \u2013 the latter was credited to D Mob with Dennis. The album got to No. 8 in the UK Albums Chart, whilst in the US Billboard Hot 100, \"You Lied to Me\" was a Top 40 hit, and \"Irresistible\" made the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] Top 10; however, the album descended the chart rapidly. Dennis experienced a brief peak of fame, making a cameo in ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' singing the songs \"Moments of Love\" (a minor US Adult Contemporary chart hit), \"Why\" (in the episode, not to feature D Mob) and \"Touch Me (All Night Long)\". In Japan, the album was called ''Into the Skyline +1'', and featured three [[bonus track|extra tracks]]: \"Nothing Moves Me\", a previous [[A-side and B-side|B-side]], and two tracks that were both released as singles, \"It's My Style\", and \"Love's a Cradle\". She also provided background vocals on [[PM Dawn]]'s US Top 10 and UK Top 20 hit \"Looking through Patient Eyes\", released in 1993.\n\nDennis began to record a third album, ''Inspiration''. The title track was recorded with [[Todd Terry]], along with another song \"Is There Life After You\". Only one song from the recording sessions was ever released, \"S.O.S.\", which can be found on the ''Beverly Hills 90210: The College Years'' soundtrack. She wrote her first song for another artist by writing a song for [[Dannii Minogue]] called \"[[Love's on Every Corner]]\".\n\nIn 1996, Dennis changed musical process: away from the dance-pop sound of previous releases, to a more traditional singer-songwriter approach. The resulting album, ''[[Am I the Kinda Girl?]]'', was more in keeping with the [[Britpop]] sound of bands such as [[Blur (band)|Blur]] and performers such as [[Stephen Duffy]], and featured collaborations with [[Guy Chambers]] of [[The Lemon Trees]] and [[Andy Partridge]] of [[XTC]].\n\nIn 2001, [[Kylie Minogue]] had a worldwide hit with the Dennis and Rob Davis penned song \"[[Can't Get You Out of My Head]]\". The following year Dennis won the Best Dance Recording Grammy for writing \"[[Come into My World]]\". She followed that up with [[Britney Spears]]'s hit song \"[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]\" which also won the Grammy for Best Dance Recording. Dennis had a string of hits with [[S Club 7]]; she wrote almost all their hit singles such as \"Never Had a Dream Come True\", and also worked on the singles for the spin-off group [[S Club 8|S Club Juniors]] which was a younger version of S Club 7. Dennis wrote hit songs for [[Celine Dion|C\u00e9line Dion]], [[Delta Goodrem]], and for [[Hear\u2019Say]] and [[Bardot (Australian band)|Bardot]]. She also wrote the fastest selling debut single in UK history for recording artist [[Will Young]], the winner of the British music competition reality show ''[[Pop Idol]]'', and his runner-up [[Gareth Gates]]. Dennis wrote the theme song to the television series ''[[American Idol]]''. She wrote several songs for former S Club 7 member [[Rachel Stevens]] including \"[[Sweet Dreams My LA Ex]]\", and also two songs for [[Phil Roy]], one of which was on the soundtrack for the film ''[[As Good as It Gets]]'' starring [[Jack Nicholson]] and [[Helen Hunt]].\n\nAccording to news reports, Dennis was working on a new album under the name Sexcassettes, which she planned to release in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/dennis%20plans%20comeback_1069836|title=Dennis Plans Comeback|accessdate=25 July 2008}}</ref> She has collaborated with [[Mark Ronson]] on his album, ''The Business''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/mark-ronson/49535|title=Mark Ronsonrecruits Santigold, Scissor Sisters for new album|publisher=Nme.com|date=2 February 2010|accessdate=31 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2015, Dennis became a vocal affiliate with [[Galantis]] by first performing, uncredited, on their debut album ''[[Pharmacy (album)|Pharmacy]]'' on the tracks \"[[Runaway (U & I)]]\" and \"Louder, Harder, Better\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edmnyc.com/2015/09/22/interview-galantis-talk-pharmacy-song-writing-and-reveal-their-latest-collab-with-kaskade/|title=INTERVIEW: Galantis talk Pharmacy, song writing, and reveal their latest collab with Kaskade|date=2015-09-22|website=EDMNYC|access-date=2017-07-12}}</ref> She later co-wrote their song \"[[Love on Me]]\" from their second album ''[[The Aviary (album)|The Aviary]]'' and sang on five songs from their 2019 album ''Church''.\n\nIn 2019, Dennis returned to performing.

With over three million copies sold worldwide, \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" became the second highest selling single in 2001.\n\nIn 2005, Dennis won her first [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] for co-writing [[Britney Spears]]'s single \"[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]\".

In 1986, [[Simon Fuller]] signed Dennis when she was only 17 to his [[19 Entertainment|19 Management]] company and to label [[Polydor]], and this began a career-long association with the impresario that has seen Dennis provide songs for many Fuller-related artists and projects.<ref name=mw1>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicweek.com/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=24350 |title=Cathy Dennis named Woman Of The Year |accessdate=2008-10-11 |work=[[Music Week]] |publisher=United Business Media |date=8 December 2006 }}</ref><ref name=guardian>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2008/aug/15/popandrock |title=Profile: Cathy Dennis |accessdate=2008-10-11 |author=Mark Brown |date=15 August 2008 |work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited}}</ref>\n\n==Performing career==\nDennis achieved her first success as a vocalist with [[D Mob]], when their [[single (music)|single]] \"[[C'mon and Get My Love]]\" reached No. 15 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and No. 10 in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 1989.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=bth&AN=33272480&site=ehost-live|title = 6 Questions with Cathy Dennis|last = Taylor|first = Chuck|date = 26 July 2008|journal = Billboard|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 9 August 2015|volume = 120|issue = 30|pages = 54\u201355|url-access=subscription }}</ref> It is regarded as an underground classic in the [[dance music]] field, and a second collaboration with D Mob, \"That's the Way of the World\", was also a hit.<ref name=\"Larkin90\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0427-8|page=120}}</ref> It was followed by Dennis's debut album, ''[[Move to This]]''.<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> She subsequently scored three [[solo (music)|solo]] hits, all of which reached the UK Top 20 and the US [[Top 40|Top 10]]. She enjoyed considerable success in Japan in the early 1990s. The three solo hits were: \"[[Just Another Dream]]\" (UK No. 13, US No. 9, Australia No. 14), which featured D Mob on [[backing vocals]];<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> a cover of the Wish and [[Fonda Rae]] 1984 [[Nightclub|club]] hit \"[[Touch Me (All Night Long)#Cathy Dennis version|Touch Me (All Night Long)]]\" (UK No. 5, US No. 2, Australia No. 16), which is probably her most remembered hit to date;<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> and \"[[Too Many Walls]]\" (UK No. 17, US No. 8, Australia No. 57).\n\nSubsequent releases were only minor hits. Her final Top 40 hit in the US was \"You Lied to Me\" in 1992, taken from her second album ''[[Into the Skyline]]'',<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> and her final Top 40 hit in the UK was a cover of the ''[[Kinks]]''' classic \"[[Waterloo Sunset]]\", which made No. 11 during 1997. That same year, her last solo single, \"When Your Dreams Turn to Dust\", peaked in the UK at No. 43. These two latter singles were both taken from her third and last solo album, ''[[Am I the Kinda Girl?]]'',<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> also including a third single, \"West End Pad\", the album opening track (UK No. 25).\n\n\"Touch Me (All Night Long)\" stayed at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks, and was kept out of the No. 1 spot by [[Hi-Five]]'s \"I Like The Way (The Kissing Game)\" in the first week, and [[Mariah Carey]]'s \"[[I Don't Wanna Cry]]\" in the second week. The song was a [[cover version|cover]] and lyrical reworking of a 1984 single by Wish featuring Fonda Rae, which had peaked at No. 70 on the US [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] chart that year. \"Touch Me (All Night Long)\" reached No. 1 on the US [[Hot Dance Club Play]] chart, and its follow-up, \"Too Many Walls\", which Dennis co-wrote with [[Anne Dudley]] of [[Art of Noise]] (who also co-wrote the [[ABC (band)|ABC]] track \"All of My Heart\"), was a No. 1 [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] hit in the United States. It was around this time Dennis agreed to join [[Club MTV]]'s first tour, booked for six weeks. She dropped out on the third date, later publicly accusing one of [[Milli Vanilli]]'s members (the tour's headline act) of sexual harassment. During this period, she recorded a song called \"Find the Key to Your Life\" with [[David Morales]], for the [[soundtrack]] to the movie ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze]]''.\n\nDennis released her second album, ''[[Into the Skyline]]'', in September 1992, written with an aim toward the US market. The album featured the singles \"You Lied to Me\", \"Irresistible\", \"Moments of Love,\" \"Falling\", and \"Why\" \u2013 the latter was credited to D Mob with Dennis. The album got to No. 8 in the UK Albums Chart, whilst in the US Billboard Hot 100, \"You Lied to Me\" was a Top 40 hit, and \"Irresistible\" made the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] Top 10; however, the album descended the chart rapidly. Dennis experienced a brief peak of fame, making a cameo in ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' singing the songs \"Moments of Love\" (a minor US Adult Contemporary chart hit), \"Why\" (in the episode, not to feature D Mob) and \"Touch Me (All Night Long)\". In Japan, the album was called ''Into the Skyline +1'', and featured three [[bonus track|extra tracks]]: \"Nothing Moves Me\", a previous [[A-side and B-side|B-side]], and two tracks that were both released as singles, \"It's My Style\", and \"Love's a Cradle\". She also provided background vocals on [[PM Dawn]]'s US Top 10 and UK Top 20 hit \"Looking through Patient Eyes\", released in 1993.\n\nDennis began to record a third album, ''Inspiration''. The title track was recorded with [[Todd Terry]], along with another song \"Is There Life After You\". Only one song from the recording sessions was ever released, \"S.O.S.\", which can be found on the ''Beverly Hills 90210: The College Years'' soundtrack. She wrote her first song for another artist by writing a song for [[Dannii Minogue]] called \"[[Love's on Every Corner]]\".\n\nIn 1996, Dennis changed musical process: away from the dance-pop sound of previous releases, to a more traditional singer-songwriter approach. The resulting album, ''[[Am I the Kinda Girl?]]'', was more in keeping with the [[Britpop]] sound of bands such as [[Blur (band)|Blur]] and performers such as [[Stephen Duffy]], and featured collaborations with [[Guy Chambers]] of [[The Lemon Trees]] and [[Andy Partridge]] of [[XTC]].\n\nIn 2001, [[Kylie Minogue]] had a worldwide hit with the Dennis and Rob Davis penned song \"[[Can't Get You Out of My Head]]\". The following year Dennis won the Best Dance Recording Grammy for writing \"[[Come into My World]]\". She followed that up with [[Britney Spears]]'s hit song \"[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]\" which also won the Grammy for Best Dance Recording. Dennis had a string of hits with [[S Club 7]]; she wrote almost all their hit singles such as \"Never Had a Dream Come True\", and also worked on the singles for the spin-off group [[S Club 8|S Club Juniors]] which was a younger version of S Club 7. Dennis wrote hit songs for [[Celine Dion|C\u00e9line Dion]], [[Delta Goodrem]], and for [[Hear\u2019Say]] and [[Bardot (Australian band)|Bardot]]. She also wrote the fastest selling debut single in UK history for recording artist [[Will Young]], the winner of the British music competition reality show ''[[Pop Idol]]'', and his runner-up [[Gareth Gates]]. Dennis wrote the theme song to the television series ''[[American Idol]]''. She wrote several songs for former S Club 7 member [[Rachel Stevens]] including \"[[Sweet Dreams My LA Ex]]\", and also two songs for [[Phil Roy]], one of which was on the soundtrack for the film ''[[As Good as It Gets]]'' starring [[Jack Nicholson]] and [[Helen Hunt]].\n\nAccording to news reports, Dennis was working on a new album under the name Sexcassettes, which she planned to release in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/dennis%20plans%20comeback_1069836|title=Dennis Plans Comeback|accessdate=25 July 2008}}</ref> She has collaborated with [[Mark Ronson]] on his album, ''The Business''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/mark-ronson/49535|title=Mark Ronsonrecruits Santigold, Scissor Sisters for new album|publisher=Nme.com|date=2 February 2010|accessdate=31 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2015, Dennis became a vocal affiliate with [[Galantis]] by first performing, uncredited, on their debut album ''[[Pharmacy (album)|Pharmacy]]'' on the tracks \"[[Runaway (U & I)]]\" and \"Louder, Harder, Better\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edmnyc.com/2015/09/22/interview-galantis-talk-pharmacy-song-writing-and-reveal-their-latest-collab-with-kaskade/|title=INTERVIEW: Galantis talk Pharmacy, song writing, and reveal their latest collab with Kaskade|date=2015-09-22|website=EDMNYC|access-date=2017-07-12}}</ref> She later co-wrote their song \"[[Love on Me]]\" from their second album ''[[The Aviary (album)|The Aviary]]'' and sang on five songs from their 2019 album ''Church''.\n\nIn 2019, Dennis returned to performing.
