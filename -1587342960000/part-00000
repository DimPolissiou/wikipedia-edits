In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\">{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French | date=2008 | url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n==As a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader.

Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. \"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d versus \"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a [[verbum dicendi|verb of saying]] and a [[pronoun]]. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by \u201cShe said\u201d. In some languages, there is a [[discourse marker]] in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272\u20131276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u3086\u304d || \u306f || \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000|| \u306b\u306f || \u5f7c\u5973 || \u304c || \u597d\u304d || \u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u305f \u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta''' .\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (known as quotative verbs when used to introduce quotations) and quotative particles are used as quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> Quotative evidentials are also used in some languages to indicate quoted speech (e.g. [[Cusco Quechua]] spoken in Peru, [[Nanti language|Nanti]] spoken in lowland southeastern Peru, [[Laal language|Laal]] spoken in Chad).<ref name=\"quechua\">{{cite journal |last1=Korotkova |first1=Natasha |title=Evidentials and (relayed) speech acts: hearsay as quotation |journal=Proceedings of SALT 25 |date=2017 |pages=676\u2013694 |doi=10.3765/salt.v25i0.3969}}</ref><ref name=\"nanti\">{{cite book |editor1-last=LaPolla |editor1-first=Randy |editor2-last=De Busser |editor2-first=Rik |title=Language Structure and Environment |date=2015 |publisher=John Benjamins |pages=99\u2013103}}</ref><ref name=\"laal\">{{cite web |last1=Lionnet |first1=Florian |title=More than reported speech: Quotative evidentiality in Laal |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~flionnet/papers/Lionnet-WOCAL-Laal-evidential.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. ''say''). A quotative marker appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the [[syntax]] of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare English and Japanese:\n\n=====English=====\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n:She '''said''' \u201cWill you answer the phone, will you answer the phone\u201d<ref name=\"frederica\">Frederica Barbieri. ''Quotative Use in American English'', Journal of English Linguistics, Vol. 33/No.3, September 2005.</ref>\n\nIn English, verbs such as ''be like'', ''go'', and ''be all'' are non-standard quotatives that are commonly used in [[colloquialism|colloquial speech]].<ref name=\"tracy\"/> They are observed in the speech of young people not only in American English, but in other [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of English as well (e.g. ''be like'' in New Zealand English,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=King |first1=Brian |title=\"All us girls were like euuh!\": Conversational work of be like in New Zealand adolescent talk |journal=New Zealand English Journal |date=2010 |volume=24 |pages=17\u201336 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249335742_All_us_girls_were_like_euuh_Conversational_work_of_be_like_in_New_Zealand_adolescent_talk |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref> ''be like'' and ''go'' in [[Glasgow]] English<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>).<ref name=\"frederica\"/><ref name=\"adfoolen\">{{cite book |authorlink1=New quotative markers in spoken discourse |editor1-last=Ahrenholz |editor1-first=Bernt |editor2-last=Bredel |editor2-first=Ursula |editor3-last=Klein |editor3-first=Wolfgang |editor4-last=Rost-Roth |editor4-first=Martina |editor5-last=Skiba |editor5-first=Romuald |title=Empirische Forschung und Theoriebildung |date=2008 |publisher=Peter Lang |location=Frankfurt am Main |isbn=978-3-631-56930-6 |pages=117\u2013128}}</ref> Though not semantically considered verbs of saying, they are used to convey the same meaning as such verbs.

Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and [[grammatical tense|tense]] to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n===Syntax===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference]]d pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\">{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=43\u201361 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative verbs====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry.<ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just '''said that''' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband '''says that''' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit. I'll make a cup of tea.\"\n|-\n| Kenyan English || So Kabuwe Abuwe '''told''' us '''that''' \"If it is for wedding I am not going to contribute.\"\n|}\n\nThe newer quotative verb ''be like'' in English is used to only introduce direct quotations.

In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\">{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French | date=2008 | url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n==As a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M.

Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. \"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d versus \"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a [[verbum dicendi|verb of saying]] and a [[pronoun]]. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by \u201cShe said\u201d. In some languages, there is a [[discourse marker]] in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272\u20131276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u3086\u304d || \u306f || \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000|| \u306b\u306f || \u5f7c\u5973 || \u304c || \u597d\u304d || \u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u305f \u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta''' .\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (known as quotative verbs when used to introduce quotations) and quotative particles are used as quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> Quotative evidentials are also used in some languages to indicate quoted speech (e.g. [[Cusco Quechua]] spoken in Peru, [[Nanti language|Nanti]] spoken in lowland southeastern Peru, [[Laal language|Laal]] spoken in Chad).<ref name=\"quechua\">{{cite journal |last1=Korotkova |first1=Natasha |title=Evidentials and (relayed) speech acts: hearsay as quotation |journal=Proceedings of SALT 25 |date=2017 |pages=676\u2013694 |doi=10.3765/salt.v25i0.3969}}</ref><ref name=\"nanti\">{{cite book |editor1-last=LaPolla |editor1-first=Randy |editor2-last=De Busser |editor2-first=Rik |title=Language Structure and Environment |date=2015 |publisher=John Benjamins |pages=99\u2013103}}</ref><ref name=\"laal\">{{cite web |last1=Lionnet |first1=Florian |title=More than reported speech: Quotative evidentiality in Laal |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~flionnet/papers/Lionnet-WOCAL-Laal-evidential.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation).

''Quotative Use in American English'', Journal of English Linguistics, Vol. 33/No.3, September 2005.</ref>\n\nIn English, verbs such as ''be like'', ''go'', and ''be all'' are non-standard quotatives that are commonly used in [[colloquialism|colloquial speech]].<ref name=\"tracy\"/> They are observed in the speech of young people not only in American English, but in other [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of English as well (e.g. ''be like'' in New Zealand English,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=King |first1=Brian |title=\"All us girls were like euuh!\": Conversational work of be like in New Zealand adolescent talk |journal=New Zealand English Journal |date=2010 |volume=24 |pages=17\u201336 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249335742_All_us_girls_were_like_euuh_Conversational_work_of_be_like_in_New_Zealand_adolescent_talk |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref> ''be like'' and ''go'' in [[Glasgow]] English<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>).<ref name=\"frederica\"/><ref name=\"adfoolen\">{{cite book |authorlink1=New quotative markers in spoken discourse |editor1-last=Ahrenholz |editor1-first=Bernt |editor2-last=Bredel |editor2-first=Ursula |editor3-last=Klein |editor3-first=Wolfgang |editor4-last=Rost-Roth |editor4-first=Martina |editor5-last=Skiba |editor5-first=Romuald |title=Empirische Forschung und Theoriebildung |date=2008 |publisher=Peter Lang |location=Frankfurt am Main |isbn=978-3-631-56930-6 |pages=117\u2013128}}</ref> Though not semantically considered verbs of saying, they are used to convey the same meaning as such verbs.

Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and [[grammatical tense|tense]] to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n===Syntax===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference]]d pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\">{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=43\u201361 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative verbs====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry.<ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just ''said that'' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband ''says that'' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit. I'll make a cup of tea.\"\n|-\n| Kenyan English || So Kabuwe Abuwe ''told'' us ''that'' \"If it is for wedding I am not going to contribute.\"\n|}\n\nThe newer quotative verb ''be like'' in English is used to only introduce direct quotations. ''Be like'' includes the use of the demonstrative ''that'', which is null in most English varieties, but can be optionally overt in some varieties like Glasgow English. Dutch's quotative verb ''hebben zoiets van'' has a similar structure to Standard American English in that it has a null demonstrative that precedes the quotation. It differs from the English structures in that it uses an overt quantifier ''zoiets'' to be [[grammaticality|well-formed]].<ref name=\"haddican et al\">{{cite journal |last1=Haddican |first1=William |last2=Zweig |first2=Eytan |last3=Johnson |first3=Daniel Ezra |title=The syntax of be like quotatives |journal=Proceedings of the 29th West Coast Conference on Formal Linguistics |date=2012 |page=81-89 |url=http://www.lingref.com/cpp/wccfl/29/paper2690.pdf}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Samples may comprise rhythm, melody, speech, sounds, or entire bars of music, and may be layered, [[Equalization (audio)|equalized]], sped up or slowed down, repitched, [[Loop (music)|looped]], or otherwise manipulated. They are usually integrated using hardware ([[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]]) or software such as [[Digital audio workstation|digital audio workstations]].\n\nA process similar to sampling originated in the 1940s with ''[[musique concr\u00e8te]]'', experimental music created by [[Tape splice|splicing]] and [[Tape loop|looping tape]]. The mid-20th century saw the introduction of keyboard instruments that played back sounds recorded on tape, such as the [[Mellotron]]. The term ''sampling'' was coined in the late 1970s by the creators of the [[Fairlight CMI]], an influential sampling synthesizer. Initially, samplers were unaffordable for most musicians and could only play back short sounds; as technology improved, cheaper samplers with more [[Computer memory|memory]] emerged, such as the [[E-mu Emulator]], [[Akai S900|Akai S950]], and [[Akai MPC]]. \n\nSampling is a foundation of [[hip hop music]], which emerged with 1980s producers sampling [[funk]] and [[Soul music|soul]] records, particularly [[Drum break|drum breaks]], to be [[Rapping|rapped]] over. Sampling has since influenced all genres of music, particularly [[electronic music]] and [[Pop music|pop]]. Musicians have created albums assembled entirely from samples, such as [[DJ Shadow|DJ Shadow's]] 1996 album ''[[Endtroducing.....|Endtroducing]].'' Samples such as the [[Amen break]], the \"[[Funky Drummer]]\" drum break, and the [[orchestra hit]] have been used in thousands of recordings.\n\nSampling without permission can [[Copyright infringement|infringe copyright]]. The process of acquiring permission for a sample is known as '''clearance''', a potentially complex and costly process. Landmark legal cases, such as ''[[Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Records Inc.|Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Records Inc]]'' (1991), changed how samples are used; as the court ruled that unlicensed sampling constitutes [[copyright infringement]], samples from well known sources are now often prohibitively expensive.\n\n== Precursors ==\n[[File:Phonogene.jpg|thumb|234x234px|The Phonogene, a 1940s instrument which plays back sounds from tape loops]]\nIn the 1940s, French composer [[Pierre Schaeffer]] developed ''[[musique concr\u00e8te]]'', an experimental form of music created by [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|recording sounds to tape]], splicing them, and manipulating them to create [[Sound collage|sound collages]]. He used sounds from sources such as the human body, locomotives, and kitchen utensils.<ref name=\":0\" /> The method also involved [[Tape loop|tape loops]], splicing lengths of tape end to end so a sound could be played indefinitely.<ref name=\":0\" /> Schaeffer developed the [[Phonogene]], which played loops at twelve different pitches triggered by a keyboard.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nComposers including [[John Cage]], [[Edgard Var\u00e8se|Edgar Var\u00e8se]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen|Karheinz Stockhausen]] and [[Iannis Xenakis]] experimented with ''musique concr\u00e8te,''<ref name=\":0\" /> and [[Bebe and Louis Barron]] used it to create the first totally electronic film soundtrack, for the 1956 science fiction film ''[[Forbidden Planet]]''. ''Musique concr\u00e8te'' was brought to a mainstream audience by the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]], which used these early sampling techniques to produce soundtracks for shows including ''[[Doctor Who]]''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the 1960s, Jamaican [[Dub music|dub reggae]] producers such as [[King Tubby]] and [[Lee \"Scratch\" Perry]] began using pre-recorded samples of [[reggae]] rhythms to produce [[riddim]] tracks, which were then [[Deejay (Jamaican)|deejayed]] over.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=goNpkxHhH48C&pg=PA55|title=Reggae Wisdom: Proverbs in Jamaican Music|publisher=Univ.

Samples may comprise rhythm, melody, speech, sounds, or entire bars of music, and may be layered, [[Equalization (audio)|equalized]], sped up or slowed down, repitched, [[Loop (music)|looped]], or otherwise manipulated. They are usually integrated using hardware ([[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]]) or software such as [[Digital audio workstation|digital audio workstations]].\n\nA process similar to sampling originated in the 1940s with ''[[musique concr\u00e8te]]'', experimental music created by [[Tape splice|splicing]] and [[Tape loop|looping tape]]. The mid-20th century saw the introduction of keyboard instruments that played back sounds recorded on tape, such as the [[Mellotron]]. The term ''sampling'' was coined in the late 1970s by the creators of the [[Fairlight CMI]], an influential sampling synthesizer. Initially, samplers were unaffordable for most musicians and could only play back short sounds; as technology improved, cheaper samplers with more [[Computer memory|memory]] emerged, such as the [[E-mu Emulator]], [[Akai S900|Akai S950]], and [[Akai MPC]]. \n\nSampling is a foundation of [[hip hop music]], which emerged with 1980s producers sampling [[funk]] and [[Soul music|soul]] records, particularly [[Drum break|drum breaks]], to be [[Rapping|rapped]] over. Sampling has since influenced all genres of music, particularly [[electronic music]] and [[Pop music|pop]]. Musicians have created albums assembled entirely from samples, such as [[DJ Shadow|DJ Shadow's]] 1996 album ''[[Endtroducing.....|Endtroducing]].'' Samples such as the [[Amen break]], the \"[[Funky Drummer]]\" drum break, and the [[orchestra hit]] have been used in thousands of recordings.\n\nSampling without permission can [[Copyright infringement|infringe copyright]]. The process of acquiring permission for a sample is known as '''clearance''', a potentially complex and costly process. Landmark legal cases, such as ''[[Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Records Inc.|Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Records Inc]]'' (1991), changed how samples are used; as the court ruled that unlicensed sampling constitutes [[copyright infringement]], samples from well known sources are now often prohibitively expensive.\n\n== Precursors ==\n[[File:Phonogene.jpg|thumb|234x234px|The Phonogene, a 1940s instrument which plays back sounds from tape loops]]\nIn the 1940s, French composer [[Pierre Schaeffer]] developed ''[[musique concr\u00e8te]]'', an experimental form of music created by [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|recording sounds to tape]], splicing them, and manipulating them to create [[Sound collage|sound collages]]. He used sounds from sources such as the human body, locomotives, and kitchen utensils.<ref name=\":0\" /> The method also involved [[Tape loop|tape loops]], splicing lengths of tape end to end so a sound could be played indefinitely.<ref name=\":0\" /> Schaeffer developed the [[Phonogene]], which played loops at twelve different pitches triggered by a keyboard.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nComposers including [[John Cage]], [[Edgard Var\u00e8se|Edgar Var\u00e8se]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen|Karheinz Stockhausen]] and [[Iannis Xenakis]] experimented with ''musique concr\u00e8te,''<ref name=\":0\" /> and [[Bebe and Louis Barron]] used it to create the first totally electronic film soundtrack, for the 1956 science fiction film ''[[Forbidden Planet]]''. ''Musique concr\u00e8te'' was brought to a mainstream audience by the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]], which used these early sampling techniques to produce soundtracks for shows including ''[[Doctor Who]]''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the 1960s, Jamaican [[Dub music|dub reggae]] producers such as [[King Tubby]] and [[Lee \"Scratch\" Perry]] began using pre-recorded samples of [[reggae]] rhythms to produce [[riddim]] tracks, which were then [[Deejay (Jamaican)|deejayed]] over.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=goNpkxHhH48C&pg=PA55|title=Reggae Wisdom: Proverbs in Jamaican Music|publisher=Univ.

Because technologies such as [[weather satellite|satellite monitoring]] were not available until the 1960s, historical data on tropical cyclones from this period are often not reliable. As a result of a [[Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project|reanalysis project]] which analyzed the season in 2012, a tropical storm and a hurricane were added to [[HURDAT]]; the official intensities and tracks of storms were also revised. The year's first storm formed on July&nbsp;29 in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and the final system, a hurricane, dissipated over open ocean on October&nbsp;21.\n\nMost of the season's storms arose from the [[subtropics]]. [[Nova Scotia]] was a focus for storm activity; four storms reached the Canadian province as [[extratropical cyclone]]s. Two of these were the remnants of hurricanes; the [[#Hurricane Four|first]] inflicted $1.5&nbsp;million in damage on the apple crop in the [[Annapolis Valley]], and the [[#Hurricane Eight|second]] tore up four [[breakwater (structure)|breakwaters]] and sank or grounded several ships. A [[#Tropical Storm Ten|short-lived tropical storm in October]] caused the wettest 48-hour period in the history of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans, Louisiana]], with {{cvt|16.65|in|mm}} of rainfall, causing the city's most destructive flood since the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]]. A [[#Tropical Storm Seven|tropical storm]] striking parts of the [[United States Gulf Coast|U.S. Gulf Coast]] was blamed for the season's only two deaths, but otherwise did minor damage. The season's strongest storm was estimated to have produced [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 125&nbsp;mph (205&nbsp;km/h); it did not affect any landmasses, remaining over the more central longitudes of the Atlantic.\n\n==Systems==\n<center>\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:800 height:200\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20\nLegend    = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\nAlignBars = early\n\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/07/2017 till:01/11/2017\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/07/2017\n\nColors     =\n  id:canvas value:gray(0.88)\n  id:GP     value:red\n  id:TD     value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1)  legend:Tropical_Depression_=_\u226439_mph_(\u226462_km/h)\n  id:TS     value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96)  legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39\u201373_mph_(63\u2013117_km/h)\n  id:C1     value:rgb(1,1,0.80)     legend:Category_1_=_74\u201395_mph_(118\u2013153_km/h)\n  id:C2     value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46)  legend:Category_2_=_96\u2013110_mph_(154\u2013177_km/h)\n  id:C3     value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25)  legend:Category_3_=_111\u2013129_mph_(178\u2013208_km/h)\n  id:C4     value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13)  legend:Category_4_=_130\u2013156_mph_(209\u2013251_km/h)\n  id:C5     value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38)  legend:Category_5_=_\u2265157_mph_(\u2265252_km/h)\n\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\n\nBarData =\n  barset:Hurricane\n  bar:Month\n\nPlotData=\n\n  barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till\n  from:29/07/2017 till:01/08/2017 color:TS text:\"One (TS)\"\n  from:01/08/2017 till:04/08/2017 color:TD text:\"TD\"\n  from:02/08/2017 till:09/08/2017 color:TS text:\"Two (TS)\"\n  from:24/08/2017 till:02/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Three (TS)\"\n  from:09/09/2017 till:14/09/2017 color:C2 text:\"Four (C2)\"\n  from:10/09/2017 till:12/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Five (TS)\"\n  from:13/09/2017 till:19/09/2017 color:C3 text:\"Six (C3)\"\n  barset:break\n  from:16/09/2017 till:21/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Seven (C1)\"\n  from:20/09/2017 till:26/09/2017 color:C2 text:\"Eight (C2)\"\n  from:26/09/2017 till:28/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Nine (TS)\"\n  from:02/10/2017 till:04/10/2017 color:TS text:\"Ten (TS)\"\n  from:19/10/2017 till:21/10/2017 color:C1 text:\"Eleven (C1)\"\n\n  bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas\n  from:01/07/2017 till:31/07/2017 text:July\n  from:01/08/2017 till:31/08/2017 text:August\n  from:01/09/2017 till:30/09/2017 text:September\n  from:01/10/2017 till:31/10/2017 text:October\nTextData =\n   pos:(570,30)\n   text:\"(From the\"\n   pos:(618,30)\n   text:\"[[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]])\"\n\n</timeline>\n</center>\n===Tropical Storm One===\n{{Infobox Hurricane Small\n|Basin=Atl\n|Image=Tropical Storm One surface analysis 31 July 1937.png\n|Track=1937 Atlantic tropical storm 1 track.png\n|Formed=July 29\n|Dissipated=August 1\n|1-min winds=60\n|Pressure=996\n}}\nIn late July, a [[stationary front]] was draped across the northeastern [[Gulf of Mexico]].

From October 16\u201317, a cold front moved eastward across the basin. An area of low pressure formed along the southern end of the dissipating boundary, initially harboring characteristics of an extratropical cyclone. This low became more symmetric while also intensifying, transitioning into a hurricane by 00:00&nbsp;UTC on October&nbsp;19 while located roughly 715&nbsp;miles (1,150&nbsp;km) southeast of Newfoundland. The system attained peak winds of 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h) within six hours and weakened shortly thereafter while moving west-northwest.

A second tropical depression developed in the Gulf of Mexico and passed near New Orleans, Louisiana, on August&nbsp;29. A nearly stationary tropical depression developed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on September&nbsp;29 and dissipated two days later; it may have been absorbed by [[#Tropical Storm Ten|Tropical Storm Ten]]. This system was originally included in the [[HURDAT|official Atlantic hurricane track database]] as a tropical storm, but was found to have winds of only 30&nbsp;mph (45&nbsp;km/h) by the reanalysis. On October&nbsp;8, a northward-moving tropical depression spawned from a tropical wave well east of the Lesser Antilles, eventually transitioning into an extratropical system on October&nbsp;14. The season's final tropical cyclone was a nearly stationary tropical depression that persisted in the central Caribbean Sea between October&nbsp;25\u201329.

Because technologies such as [[weather satellite|satellite monitoring]] were not available until the 1960s, historical data on tropical cyclones from this period are often not reliable. As a result of a [[Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project|reanalysis project]] which analyzed the season in 2012, a tropical storm and a hurricane were added to [[HURDAT]]; the official intensities and tracks of storms were also revised. The year's first storm formed on July&nbsp;29 in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and the final system, a hurricane, dissipated over open ocean on October&nbsp;21.\n\nMost of the season's storms arose from the [[subtropics]]. [[Nova Scotia]] was a focus for storm activity; four storms reached the Canadian province as [[extratropical cyclone]]s. Two of these were the remnants of hurricanes; the [[#Hurricane Four|first]] inflicted $1.5&nbsp;million in damage on the apple crop in the [[Annapolis Valley]], and the [[#Hurricane Eight|second]] tore up four [[breakwater (structure)|breakwaters]] and sank or grounded several ships. A [[#Tropical Storm Ten|short-lived tropical storm in October]] caused the wettest 48-hour period in the history of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans, Louisiana]], with {{cvt|16.65|in|mm}} of rainfall, causing the city's most destructive flood since the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]]. A [[#Tropical Storm Seven|tropical storm]] striking parts of the [[United States Gulf Coast|U.S. Gulf Coast]] was blamed for the season's only two deaths, but otherwise did minor damage. The season's strongest storm was estimated to have produced [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 125&nbsp;mph (205&nbsp;km/h); it did not affect any landmasses, remaining over the more central longitudes of the Atlantic.\n\n==Systems==\n<center>\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:800 height:200\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20\nLegend    = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\nAlignBars = early\n\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/07/2017 till:01/11/2017\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/07/2017\n\nColors     =\n  id:canvas value:gray(0.88)\n  id:GP     value:red\n  id:TD     value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1)  legend:Tropical_Depression_=_\u226439_mph_(\u226462_km/h)\n  id:TS     value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96)  legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39\u201373_mph_(63\u2013117_km/h)\n  id:C1     value:rgb(1,1,0.80)     legend:Category_1_=_74\u201395_mph_(118\u2013153_km/h)\n  id:C2     value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46)  legend:Category_2_=_96\u2013110_mph_(154\u2013177_km/h)\n  id:C3     value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25)  legend:Category_3_=_111\u2013129_mph_(178\u2013208_km/h)\n  id:C4     value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13)  legend:Category_4_=_130\u2013156_mph_(209\u2013251_km/h)\n  id:C5     value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38)  legend:Category_5_=_\u2265157_mph_(\u2265252_km/h)\n\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\n\nBarData =\n  barset:Hurricane\n  bar:Month\n\nPlotData=\n\n  barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till\n  from:29/07/2017 till:01/08/2017 color:TS text:\"One (TS)\"\n  from:01/08/2017 till:04/08/2017 color:TD text:\"TD\"\n  from:02/08/2017 till:09/08/2017 color:TS text:\"Two (TS)\"\n  from:24/08/2017 till:02/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Three (TS)\"\n  from:09/09/2017 till:14/09/2017 color:C2 text:\"Four (C2)\"\n  from:10/09/2017 till:12/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Five (TS)\"\n  from:13/09/2017 till:19/09/2017 color:C3 text:\"Six (C3)\"\n  barset:break\n  from:16/09/2017 till:21/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Seven (C1)\"\n  from:20/09/2017 till:26/09/2017 color:C2 text:\"Eight (C2)\"\n  from:26/09/2017 till:28/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Nine (TS)\"\n  from:02/10/2017 till:04/10/2017 color:TS text:\"Ten (TS)\"\n  from:19/10/2017 till:21/10/2017 color:C1 text:\"Eleven (C1)\"\n\n  bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas\n  from:01/07/2017 till:31/07/2017 text:July\n  from:01/08/2017 till:31/08/2017 text:August\n  from:01/09/2017 till:30/09/2017 text:September\n  from:01/10/2017 till:31/10/2017 text:October\nTextData =\n   pos:(570,30)\n   text:\"(From the\"\n   pos:(618,30)\n   text:\"[[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]])\"\n\n</timeline>\n</center>\n===Tropical Storm One===\n{{Infobox Hurricane Small\n|Basin=Atl\n|Image=Tropical Storm One surface analysis 31 July 1937.png\n|Track=1937 Atlantic tropical storm 1 track.png\n|Formed=July 29\n|Dissipated=August 1\n|1-min winds=60\n|Pressure=996\n}}\nIn late July, a [[stationary front]] was draped across the northeastern [[Gulf of Mexico]].
