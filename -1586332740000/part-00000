{"title_page": "Unicode compatibility characters", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{original research|date=July 2008}}\n{{refimprove|date=July 2016}}\n}}\n\nIn [[Unicode]] and the [[Universal Character Set|UCS]], a '''compatibility character''' is a character that is encoded solely to maintain [[Round-trip format conversion|round-trip convertibility]] with other, often older, standards.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chapter 2.3: Compatibility characters|url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.0.0/ch02.pdf#G11062|work=The Unicode Standard 6.0.0}}</ref> As the Unicode Glossary says:\n\n<blockquote>\nA character that would not have been encoded except for compatibility and round-trip convertibility with other standards<ref>[https://www.unicode.org/glossary/#compatibility_character Unicode consortium Unicode Glossary]</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAlthough ''compatibility'' is used in names, it is not marked as a property. However, the definition is more complicated than the glossary reveals. One of the properties given to characters by the Unicode consortium is the characters' '''decomposition''' or '''[[compatibility decomposition]]'''. Over five thousand characters do have a compatibility decomposition mapping that compatibility character to one or more other UCS characters. By setting a character's decomposition property, Unicode establishes that character as a compatibility character. The reasons for these compatibility designations are varied and are discussed in further detail below. The term ''decomposition'' sometimes confuses because a character's decomposition can, in some cases, be a singleton. In these cases the decomposition of one character is simply another approximately (but not canonically) [[Unicode equivalence|equivalent]] character.\n\n== Compatibility character types and keywords  ==\n{{Time-context|section|that may not be current but does not specify which version of Unicode is being referenced|date=June 2018}}\nThe compatibility decomposition property for the 5,402 Unicode compatibility characters{{when|date=June 2018}} includes a keyword that divides the compatibility characters into 17 logical groups. Those characters with a compatibility decomposition but without a keyword are termed canonical decomposable characters and those characters are not compatibility characters. Keywords for compatibility decomposable characters include: &lt;initial&gt;, &lt;medial&gt;, &lt;final&gt;, &lt;isolated&gt;, &lt;wide&gt;, &lt;narrow&gt;, &lt;small&gt;, &lt;square&gt;, &lt;vertical&gt;, &lt;circle&gt;, &lt;noBreak&gt;, &lt;fraction&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;, &lt;super&gt;, and &lt;compat&gt;. These keywords provide some indication of the relation between the compatibility character and its compatibility decomposition character sequence. Compatibility characters fall in three basic categories:\n# Characters corresponding to multiple alternate glyph forms and precomposed diacritics to support software and font implementations that do not include complete Unicode text layout capabilities.\n# Characters included from other character sets or otherwise added to the UCS that constitute [[formatted text|rich text]] rather than the plain text goals of Unicode.\n# Some other characters that are semantically distinct, but [[homoglyph|visually similar]].\nBecause these semantically distinct characters may be displayed with glyphs similar to the glyphs of other characters, text processing software should try to address possible confusion for the sake of end users. When comparing and collating (sorting) text strings, different forms and rich text variants of characters should not alter the text processing results. For example, software users may be confused when performing a find on a page for a capital Latin letter 'I' and their software application fails to find the visually similar [[Roman numeral]] '\u2160'.\n\n== Compatibility mappings types ==\n\n=== Glyph substitution and composition ===\nSome compatibility characters are completely dispensable for text processing and display software that conforms to the Unicode standard. These include:\n;[[typographic ligature|Ligatures]]: Ligatures such as 'ffi' in the Latin script were often encoded as a separate character in legacy character sets. Unicode's approach to ligatures is to treat them as rich text and, if turned on, handled through glyph substitution.\n;Precomposed Roman numerals: For example, Roman numeral  twelve ('\u216b': U+216B) can be decomposed into a Roman numeral ten ('\u2169': U+2169) and two Roman numeral ones ('\u2160': U+2160).\n;Precomposed [[vulgar fraction|fractions]]: These decomposition have the keyword &lt;fraction&gt;. A fully conforming text handler should<ref>{{cite web|author=The Unicode Consortium|authorlink=Unicode Consortium|year=2010|title=The Unicode Standard, Version 6.0.0|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|isbn=978-0321480910|pages=212|url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.0.0/ch06.pdf#G12861}}</ref> display the vulgar fraction \u00bc (U+00BC) identically to the composed fraction  1\u20444 (numeral 1 with fraction slash U+2044 and numeral 4).\n;Contextual glyphs or forms: These arise primarily in the Arabic script. Using fonts with glyph substitution capabilities such as [[OpenType]] and [[Apple Advanced Typography|TrueTypeGX]], Unicode conforming software can substitute the proper glyphs for the same character depending on whether that character appears at the beginning, end, middle of a word or in isolation. Such glyph substitution is also necessary for vertical (top to bottom) text layout for some East Asian languages. In this case glyphs must be substituted or synthesized for wide, narrow, small and square glyph forms. Non-conforming software or software using other character sets instead use multiple separate character for the same letter depending on its position: further complicating text processing.\n\nThe UCS, Unicode character properties and the Unicode algorithms provide software implementations with everything needed to properly display these characters from their decomposition equivalents. Therefore, these decomposable compatibility characters become redundant and unnecessary. Their existence in the character set requires extra text processing to ensure text is properly compared and collated (see [[Unicode normalization]]). Moreover, these compatibility characters provide no additional or distinct semantics. Nor do these characters provide any visually distinct rendering provided the text layout and fonts are Unicode conforming. Also, none of these characters are required for round-trip convertibility to other character sets, since the transliteration can easily map decomposed characters to precomposed counterparts in another character set. Similarly, contextual forms, such as a final Arabic letter can be mapped based on its position within a word to the appropriate legacy character set form character.\n\nIn order to dispense with these compatibility characters, text software must conform to several Unicode protocols. The software must be able to:\n#Compose diacritic marked graphemes from letter characters and one or more separate combining diacritic marks.\n#Substitute (at the author or readers discretion) ligatures and contextual glyph variants.\n#Layout CJKV text vertically (at the author's or reader's discretion), substituting glyphs for small, vertical, narrow, wide square forms, either from font data or synthesized as needed.\n#Combine fractions using the '[[\u2044|Fraction Slash]]' character (\u2044 U+2044) and any other arbitrary characters.\n#Combine a '[[\u0338|Combining Long Solidus Overlay]]' ( \u0338 U+0338) with other symbols: for example \u2204 or \u2204 for [[\u2204]] (U+2203).\n\nAll together these compatibility characters included for incomplete Unicode implementations total 3,779 of the 5,402 designated compatibility characters. These include all of the compatibility characters marked with the keywords &lt;initial>, &lt;medial>, &lt;final>, &lt;isolated>, &lt;fraction>,  &lt;wide>, &lt;narrow>, &lt;small>, &lt;vertical>, &lt;square>. Also it includes nearly all of the canonical and most of the &lt;compat> keyword compatibility characters (the exceptions include those &lt;compat> keyword characters for enclosed alphanumerics, enclosed ideographs and those discussed in [[#Semantically distinct characters|\u00a7 Semantically distinct characters]]).\n\n=== Rich text compatibility characters ===\nMany other compatibility characters constitute what Unicode considers rich text and therefore outside the goals of Unicode and UCS. In some sense even compatibility characters discussed in the previous section \u2014 those that aid legacy software in displaying ligatures and vertical text \u2014 constitute a form of rich text, since the rich text protocols determine whether text is displayed in one way or another. However, the choice to display text with or without ligatures or vertically versus horizontally are both non-semantic rich text. They are simply style differences. This is in contrast to other rich text such as italics, superscripts and subscripts,  or list markers where the styling of the rich text implies certain semantics along with it.\n\nFor comparing, collating, handling and storing plain text, rich text variants are semantically redundant. For example, using a superscript character for the numeral 4 is likely indistinguishable from using the standard character for a numeral 4 and then using rich text protocols to make it superscript. Such alternate rich text characters therefore create ambiguity because they appear visually the same as their plain text counterpart characters with rich text formatting applied. These rich text compatibility characters include:\n;[[Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols]]: These symbols are simply clones of the Latin and Greek alphabets and Indic-Arabic decimal digits repeated in 15 various typefaces. They are intended as an arbitrary palette for mathematical notation. However, they tend to undermine the distinction between encoding characters versus encoding visual glyphs as well as Unicode's goals of supporting only plain text characters. Such alternate styling for a mathematical symbol palette could be easily created through rich text protocols instead.\n;[[Enclosed Alphanumerics]] and ideographs (markers): These are characters included primarily for list markers. They do not constitute plain text characters. Moreover, the use of other rich text protocols is more appropriate since, the set of enclosed alphanumerics or ideographs provisioned in the UCS is limited.\n;Circled alphanumerics and ideographs: The circled forms are also likely for use as markers. Again, using characters along with rich text protocols to encircle characters strings is more flexible.\n;[[Space (punctuation)|Spaces and no-break spaces]] of varying widths: These characters are simply rich text variants of the core space (U+0020) and No-break Space (U+00A0). Other rich text protocols should be used instead such as tracking, kerning or word-spacing attributes.\n;Some [[subscript and superscript]] form characters: Many of the subscript and superscript characters are actually semantically distinct characters from the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] and other writing systems and do not really fall in the category of rich text. However, others simply constitute rich text presentation forms of other Greek, Latin and numeral characters. These rich text superscript and subscript characters therefore properly belong to this category of rich text compatibility characters. Most of these are in the \"Superscripts and Subscripts\" or the \"Basic Latin\" blocks.\n\nFor all of these rich text compatibility characters the display of glyphs is typically distinct from their compatibility decomposition (related) characters. However, these are considered compatibility characters and discouraged for use by the Unicode consortium because they are not plain text characters, which is what Unicode seeks to support with its UCS and associated protocols. Rich text should be handled through non-Unicode protocols such as HTML, CSS, RTF and other such protocols.\n\nThe rich text compatibility characters comprise 1,451{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} of the 5,402 compatibility characters. These include all of the compatibility characters marked with keywords &lt;circle> and &lt;font> (except three listed in the semantically distinct below); 11 spaces variants from the &lt;compat> and canonical characters; and some of the keyword &lt;superscript> and &lt;subscript> from the \"Superscripts and Subscripts\" block.\n\n=== Semantically distinct characters ===\n\nMany compatibility characters are semantically distinct characters, though they may share representational glyphs with other characters. Some of these characters may have been included because most other characters sets that focused on one script or writing system. So for example, the ISO and other Latin character sets likely included a character for \u03c0 (pi) since, when focusing on primarily one writing system or script, those character sets would not have otherwise had characters for the common mathematical symbol \u03c0;. However, with Unicode, mathematicians are free to use characters from any known script in the World to stand in for a mathematical set or mathematical constant. To date, Unicode has only added specific semantic support for a few such mathematical constants (for example the Planck constant, U+210E, and Euler constant, U+2107, both of which Unicode considers to be compatibility characters). Therefore, Unicode designates several mathematical symbols based on letters from Greek and Hebrew as compatibility characters. These include:\n\n* [[Hebrew letter]] based symbols (4): alef (\u2135 U+2135), bet (\u2136 U+2136), gimel (\u2137 U+2137) and dalet (\u2138 U+2138)\n* [[Greek letter]] based symbols (7): beta (\u03d0 U+03D0), theta (\u03d1 U+03D1), phi (\u03d5 U+03D5), pi (\u03d6 U+03D6), kappa (\u03f0 U+03F0), rho (\u03f1 U+03F1), capital theta (\u03f4 U+03F4)\n\nWhile these compatibility characters are distinguished from their compatibility decomposition characters only by adding the word \"symbol\" to their name, they do represent long-standing distinct meanings in written mathematics. However, for all practical purposes they share the same semantics as their compatibility equivalent Greek or Hebrew letter. These may be considered border-line semantically distinguishable characters so they are not included in the total.\n\nThough not the intention of Unicode to encode such measuring units the repertoire includes six (6) such symbols that should not be used by authors: the characters' decompositions should be used instead.\n* Unit symbols (6): [[Angstrom]] (\u00c5 U+212B: use U+00C5 instead), [[Ohm]] (\u03a9, U+2126: use U+03A9 instead), [[Kelvin]] (K U+212A: use U+004B instead), [[Fahrenheit]] (\u2109 U+2109: use [[\u00b0|U+00B0]] and U+0046 instead), [[Celsius]] (\u2103 U+2103: use U+00B0 and U+0043 instead), [[micro-|Micro]] Sign (\u00b5 U+00B5: use U+03BC instead)\n\nUnicode also designates twenty-two (22) other letter-like symbols as compatibility characters.\n* Other Greek letter-based symbols (4): lunate epsilon (\u03f5 U+03F5), lunate sigma (\u03f2 U+03F2), capital lunate sigma (\u03f9 U+03F9), upsilon with hook (\u03d2 U+03D2)\n* Mathematical constants (3): Euler constant ([[\u2107]] U+2107), [[Planck constant]] (\u210e U+210E), [[reduced Planck constant]] (\u210f U+210F),\n* Currency symbols (2): rupee sign (\u20a8 U+20A8), rial sign (\ufdfc U+FDFC)\n* Punctuation (4): one dot leader (U+2024), no-break space (U+00A0), non-breaking hyphen (U+2011), Tibetan mark delimiter tsheg bstar (U+0F0C)\n* Other letter-like symbols (10): information source (\u2139 U+2139), account of (\u2100 U+2100), addressed to the subject (\u2101 U+2101), care of (\u2105 U+2105), cada una (\u2106 U+2106), [[Numero sign|numero]] (\u2116 U+2116), telephone sign (\u2121 U+2121), facsimile sign (\u213b U+213B), trademark (\u2122 U+2122), service mark (\u2120 U+2120)\n\nIn addition, several scripts{{which|date=January 2012}} use glyph position such as superscripts and subscripts to differentiate semantics. In these cases subscripts and superscripts are not merely rich text, but constitute a distinct character \u2014 similar to a hybrid between a diacritic and a letter{{Or|date=January 2012}}<!-- are they [[Spacing modifier character]]s or what? there is no example, so we should guess author's intentions. -->  \u2014 in the writing system (130 total).\n\n* 112 characters representing abstract phonemes from phonetic alphabets such as the  [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] use such positional glyphs to represent semantic differences (U+1D2C \u2013 U+1D6A, U+1D78, U+1D9B \u2013 U+1DBF, U+02B0 \u2013 U+02B8, U+02E0 \u2013 U+02E4 )\n* 14 characters from the [[Kanbun]] block (U+3192 \u2013 U+319F)\n* 1 character from the [[Tifinagh]] script: Tifinagh Modifier Letter Labialization Mark (\u2d6f U+2D6F)\n* 1 character from the [[Georgian script]]: Modifier Letter Georgian Nar (\u10fc U+10FC)\n* masculine ([[\u00ba|U+00BA]]) and feminine ([[\u00aa|U+00AA]]) ordinal indicators included in the Latin-1 supplement{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} block\n\nFinally, Unicode designates Roman numerals as compatibility equivalence to the Latin letters that share the same glyphs.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n* Capital Roman Numerals (7): One (\u2160 U+2160), Five (\u2164 U+2164), Ten (\u2169 U+2169), Fifty (\u216c U+216C), One Hundred (\u216d U+216D), Five Hundred (\u216e U+216E), One Thousand (\u216f U+216F)\n* and lower case variants (7): One (\u2170 U+2170), Five (\u2174 U+2174), Ten (\u2179 U+2179), Fifty (\u217c U+217C), One Hundred (\u217d U+217D), Five Hundred (\u217e U+217E) and One Thousand (\u217f U+217F)\n* 18 precomposed Roman numerals in uppercase and lowercase variants (2\u20134, 6\u20139 and 11\u201312)\n\nRoman numeral One Thousand actually has a third character representing a third form or glyph for the same semantic unit: One Thousand C D (\u2180 U+2180). From this glyph, one can see where the practice of using a Latin M may have arisen. Strangely, though Unicode unifies the [[sign-value notation|sign-value]] Roman numerals with the very different{{citation needed|date=May 2009}} (though visually similar) Latin letters, the Indic Arabic [[place-value]] (positional) decimal digit numerals are repeated 24 times (a total of 240 code points for 10 numerals) throughout the UCS without any relational or decomposition mapping between them.\n\nThe presence of these 167 semantically distinct though visually similar characters (plus the borderline 11 Hebrew and Greek letter based symbols and the 6 measurement unit symbols) among the decomposable characters complicates the topic of compatibility characters. The Unicode standard discourages the use of compatibility characters by content authors. However, in certain specialized areas, these characters are important and quite similar to other characters that have not been included among the compatibility characters. For example, in certain academic circles the use of Roman numerals as distinct from Latin letters that share the same glyphs would be no different from the use of Cuneiform numerals or ancient Greek numerals. Collapsing the Roman numeral characters to Latin letter characters eliminates a semantic distinction. A similar situation exists for phonetic alphabet characters that use subscript or superscript positioned glyphs. In the specialized circles that use phonetic alphabets, authors should be able to do so without resorting to rich text protocols. As another example the keyword 'circle' compatibility characters are often used for describing the game [[Go (game)|Go]]. However, these uses of the compatibility characters constitute exceptions where the author has a special reason to use the otherwise discouraged characters.\n\n== Compatibility blocks ==\nSeveral blocks of Unicode characters include either entirely or almost entirely all compatibility characters (U+F900\u2013U+FFEF except for the nonchars). The compatibility blocks contain none of the semantically distinct compatibility characters with only one exception: the rial currency symbol (\ufdfc U+FDFC) so the compatibility decomposable characters in the compatibility blocks fall unambiguously into the set of discouraged characters. Unicode recommends authors use the plain text compatibility decomposition equivalents instead and complement those characters with rich text markup. This approach is much more flexible and open-ended than using the finite set of circled or enclosed alphanumerics to give just one example.\n\nUnfortunately, there are a small number of characters even within the compatibility blocks that themselves are not compatibility characters and therefore may confuse authors. The \"Enclosed CJK Letters and Months\" block contains a single non-compatibility character: the 'Korean Standard Symbol' (\u327f U+327F). That symbol and 12 other characters have been included in the blocks for unknown reasons. The \"CJK Compatibility Ideographs\" block contains these non-compatibility unified Han ideographs:\n\n# (U+FA0E): \ufa0e\n# (U+FA0F): \ufa0f\n# (U+FA11): \ufa11\n# (U+FA13): \ufa13\n# (U+FA14): \ufa14\n# (U+FA1F): \ufa1f\n# (U+FA21): \ufa21\n# (U+FA23): \ufa23\n# (U+FA24): \ufa24\n# (U+FA27): \ufa27\n# (U+FA28): \ufa28\n# (U+FA29): \ufa29\n\nThese thirteen characters are not compatibility characters, and their use is not discouraged in any way. However, U+27EAF \ud85f\udeaf, the same as U+FA23 \ufa23, is mistakenly encoded in CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B.<ref>[http://appsrv.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~irg/irg/irg26/IRGN1218_Response_to_WG2.pdf#page=4 IRGN 1218]</ref> In any event, a normalized text should never contain both U+27EAF \ud85f\udeaf and U+FA23 \ufa23; these code points represent the same character, encoded twice.\n\nSeveral other characters in these blocks have no compatibility mapping but are clearly intended for legacy support:\n\nAlphabetic Presentation Forms (1)\n# Hebrew Point Judeo-Spanish Varika (U+FB1E): \ufb1e. This is a glyph variant of Hebrew Point [[Rafe (diacritic)|Rafe]] (U+05BF): \u05bf, though Unicode provides no compatibility mapping.\n\nArabic Presentation Forms (4)\n# \"Ornate Left Parenthesis\" (U+FD3E): \ufd3e.

This is similar to other operations needed when, for example, a user performs a case or diacritic insensitive search within some text. In such cases software must equate or ignore characters it would not otherwise equate or ignore.  Typically normalization is performed without altering the underlying stored text data (lossless). However, some software may potentially make permanent changes to text that eliminates the canonical or even non-canonical compatibility characters differences from text storage (lossy).\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://ctext.org/faq/normalization Normalization (Chinese Text Project)] - Unicode normalization issues in classical Chinese, with list of normalized CJK codepoints\n\n{{Unicode navigation}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Unicode Compatibility Characters}}\n[[Category:Unicode]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{original research|date=July 2008}}\n{{refimprove|date=July 2016}}\n}}\n\nIn [[Unicode]] and the [[Universal Character Set|UCS]], a '''compatibility character''' is a character that is encoded solely to maintain [[Round-trip format conversion|round trip convertibility]] with other, often older, standards.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chapter 2.3: Compatibility characters|url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.0.0/ch02.pdf#G11062|work=The Unicode Standard 6.0.0}}</ref> As the Unicode Glossary says:\n\n<blockquote>\nA character that would not have been encoded except for compatibility and round-trip convertibility with other standards<ref>[https://www.unicode.org/glossary/#compatibility_character Unicode consortium Unicode Glossary]</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAlthough ''compatibility'' is used in names, it is not marked as a property. However, the definition is more complicated than the glossary reveals. One of the properties given to characters by the Unicode consortium is the characters' '''decomposition''' or '''[[compatibility decomposition]]'''. Over five thousand characters do have a compatibility decomposition mapping that compatibility character to one or more other UCS characters. By setting a character's decomposition property, Unicode establishes that character as a compatibility character. The reasons for these compatibility designations are varied and are discussed in further detail below. The term ''decomposition'' sometimes confuses because a character's decomposition can, in some cases, be a singleton. In these cases the decomposition of one character is simply another approximately (but not canonically) [[Unicode equivalence|equivalent]] character.\n\n== Compatibility character types and keywords  ==\n{{Time-context|section|that may not be current but does not specify which version of Unicode is being referenced|date=June 2018}}\nThe compatibility decomposition property for the 5,402 Unicode compatibility characters{{when|date=June 2018}} includes a keyword that divides the compatibility characters into 17 logical groups. Those characters with a compatibility decomposition but without a keyword are termed canonical decomposable characters and those characters are not compatibility characters. Keywords for compatibility decomposable characters include: &lt;initial&gt;, &lt;medial&gt;, &lt;final&gt;, &lt;isolated&gt;, &lt;wide&gt;, &lt;narrow&gt;, &lt;small&gt;, &lt;square&gt;, &lt;vertical&gt;, &lt;circle&gt;, &lt;noBreak&gt;, &lt;fraction&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;, &lt;super&gt;, and &lt;compat&gt;. These keywords provide some indication of the relation between the compatibility character and its compatibility decomposition character sequence. Compatibility characters fall in three basic categories:\n# Characters corresponding to multiple alternate glyph forms and precomposed diacritics to support software and font implementations that do not include complete Unicode text layout capabilities.\n# Characters included from other character sets or otherwise added to the UCS that constitute [[formatted text|rich text]] rather than the plain text goals of Unicode.\n# Some other characters that are semantically distinct, but [[homoglyph|visually similar]].\nBecause these semantically distinct characters may be displayed with glyphs similar to the glyphs of other characters, text processing software should try to address possible confusion for the sake of end users. When comparing and collating (sorting) text strings, different forms and rich text variants of characters should not alter the text processing results. For example, software users may be confused when performing a find on a page for a capital Latin letter 'I' and their software application fails to find the visually similar [[Roman numeral]] '\u2160'.\n\n== Compatibility mappings types ==\n\n=== Glyph substitution and composition ===\nSome compatibility characters are completely dispensable for text processing and display software that conforms to the Unicode standard. These include:\n;[[typographic ligature|Ligatures]]: Ligatures such as 'ffi' in the Latin script were often encoded as a separate character in legacy character sets. Unicode's approach to ligatures is to treat them as rich text and, if turned on, handled through glyph substitution.\n;Precomposed Roman numerals: For example, Roman numeral  twelve ('\u216b': U+216B) can be decomposed into a Roman numeral ten ('\u2169': U+2169) and two Roman numeral ones ('\u2160': U+2160).\n;Precomposed [[vulgar fraction|fractions]]: These decomposition have the keyword &lt;fraction&gt;. A fully conforming text handler should<ref>{{cite web|author=The Unicode Consortium|authorlink=Unicode Consortium|year=2010|title=The Unicode Standard, Version 6.0.0|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|isbn=978-0321480910|pages=212|url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.0.0/ch06.pdf#G12861}}</ref> display the vulgar fraction \u00bc (U+00BC) identically to the composed fraction  1\u20444 (numeral 1 with fraction slash U+2044 and numeral 4).\n;Contextual glyphs or forms: These arise primarily in the Arabic script. Using fonts with glyph substitution capabilities such as [[OpenType]] and [[Apple Advanced Typography|TrueTypeGX]], Unicode conforming software can substitute the proper glyphs for the same character depending on whether that character appears at the beginning, end, middle of a word or in isolation. Such glyph substitution is also necessary for vertical (top to bottom) text layout for some East Asian languages. In this case glyphs must be substituted or synthesized for wide, narrow, small and square glyph forms. Non-conforming software or software using other character sets instead use multiple separate character for the same letter depending on its position: further complicating text processing.\n\nThe UCS, Unicode character properties and the Unicode algorithms provide software implementations with everything needed to properly display these characters from their decomposition equivalents. Therefore, these decomposable compatibility characters become redundant and unnecessary. Their existence in the character set requires extra text processing to ensure text is properly compared and collated (see [[Unicode normalization]]). Moreover, these compatibility characters provide no additional or distinct semantics. Nor do these characters provide any visually distinct rendering provided the text layout and fonts are Unicode conforming. Also, none of these characters are required for round-trip convertibility to other character sets, since the transliteration can easily map decomposed characters to precomposed counterparts in another character set. Similarly, contextual forms, such as a final Arabic letter can be mapped based on its position within a word to the appropriate legacy character set form character.\n\nIn order to dispense with these compatibility characters, text software must conform to several Unicode protocols. The software must be able to:\n#Compose diacritic marked graphemes from letter characters and one or more separate combining diacritic marks.\n#Substitute (at the author or readers discretion) ligatures and contextual glyph variants.\n#Layout CJKV text vertically (at the author's or reader's discretion), substituting glyphs for small, vertical, narrow, wide square forms, either from font data or synthesized as needed.\n#Combine fractions using the '[[\u2044|Fraction Slash]]' character (\u2044 U+2044) and any other arbitrary characters.\n#Combine a '[[\u0338|Combining Long Solidus Overlay]]' ( \u0338 U+0338) with other symbols: for example \u2204 or \u2204 for [[\u2204]] (U+2203).\n\nAll together these compatibility characters included for incomplete Unicode implementations total 3,779 of the 5,402 designated compatibility characters. These include all of the compatibility characters marked with the keywords &lt;initial>, &lt;medial>, &lt;final>, &lt;isolated>, &lt;fraction>,  &lt;wide>, &lt;narrow>, &lt;small>, &lt;vertical>, &lt;square>. Also it includes nearly all of the canonical and most of the &lt;compat> keyword compatibility characters (the exceptions include those &lt;compat> keyword characters for enclosed alphanumerics, enclosed ideographs and those discussed in [[#Semantically distinct characters|\u00a7 Semantically distinct characters]]).\n\n=== Rich text compatibility characters ===\nMany other compatibility characters constitute what Unicode considers rich text and therefore outside the goals of Unicode and UCS. In some sense even compatibility characters discussed in the previous section \u2014 those that aid legacy software in displaying ligatures and vertical text \u2014 constitute a form of rich text, since the rich text protocols determine whether text is displayed in one way or another. However, the choice to display text with or without ligatures or vertically versus horizontally are both non-semantic rich text. They are simply style differences. This is in contrast to other rich text such as italics, superscripts and subscripts,  or list markers where the styling of the rich text implies certain semantics along with it.\n\nFor comparing, collating, handling and storing plain text, rich text variants are semantically redundant. For example, using a superscript character for the numeral 4 is likely indistinguishable from using the standard character for a numeral 4 and then using rich text protocols to make it superscript. Such alternate rich text characters therefore create ambiguity because they appear visually the same as their plain text counterpart characters with rich text formatting applied. These rich text compatibility characters include:\n;[[Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols]]: These symbols are simply clones of the Latin and Greek alphabets and Indic-Arabic decimal digits repeated in 15 various typefaces. They are intended as an arbitrary palette for mathematical notation. However, they tend to undermine the distinction between encoding characters versus encoding visual glyphs as well as Unicode's goals of supporting only plain text characters. Such alternate styling for a mathematical symbol palette could be easily created through rich text protocols instead.\n;[[Enclosed Alphanumerics]] and ideographs (markers): These are characters included primarily for list markers. They do not constitute plain text characters. Moreover, the use of other rich text protocols is more appropriate since, the set of enclosed alphanumerics or ideographs provisioned in the UCS is limited.\n;Circled alphanumerics and ideographs: The circled forms are also likely for use as markers. Again, using characters along with rich text protocols to encircle characters strings is more flexible.\n;[[Space (punctuation)|Spaces and no-break spaces]] of varying widths: These characters are simply rich text variants of the core space (U+0020) and No-break Space (U+00A0). Other rich text protocols should be used instead such as tracking, kerning or word-spacing attributes.\n;Some [[subscript and superscript]] form characters: Many of the subscript and superscript characters are actually semantically distinct characters from the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] and other writing systems and do not really fall in the category of rich text. However, others simply constitute rich text presentation forms of other Greek, Latin and numeral characters. These rich text superscript and subscript characters therefore properly belong to this category of rich text compatibility characters. Most of these are in the \"Superscripts and Subscripts\" or the \"Basic Latin\" blocks.\n\nFor all of these rich text compatibility characters the display of glyphs is typically distinct from their compatibility decomposition (related) characters. However, these are considered compatibility characters and discouraged for use by the Unicode consortium because they are not plain text characters, which is what Unicode seeks to support with its UCS and associated protocols. Rich text should be handled through non-Unicode protocols such as HTML, CSS, RTF and other such protocols.\n\nThe rich text compatibility characters comprise 1,451{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} of the 5,402 compatibility characters. These include all of the compatibility characters marked with keywords &lt;circle> and &lt;font> (except three listed in the semantically distinct below); 11 spaces variants from the &lt;compat> and canonical characters; and some of the keyword &lt;superscript> and &lt;subscript> from the \"Superscripts and Subscripts\" block.\n\n=== Semantically distinct characters ===\n\nMany compatibility characters are semantically distinct characters, though they may share representational glyphs with other characters. Some of these characters may have been included because most other characters sets that focused on one script or writing system. So for example, the ISO and other Latin character sets likely included a character for \u03c0 (pi) since, when focusing on primarily one writing system or script, those character sets would not have otherwise had characters for the common mathematical symbol \u03c0;. However, with Unicode, mathematicians are free to use characters from any known script in the World to stand in for a mathematical set or mathematical constant. To date, Unicode has only added specific semantic support for a few such mathematical constants (for example the Planck constant, U+210E, and Euler constant, U+2107, both of which Unicode considers to be compatibility characters). Therefore, Unicode designates several mathematical symbols based on letters from Greek and Hebrew as compatibility characters. These include:\n\n* [[Hebrew letter]] based symbols (4): alef (\u2135 U+2135), bet (\u2136 U+2136), gimel (\u2137 U+2137) and dalet (\u2138 U+2138)\n* [[Greek letter]] based symbols (7): beta (\u03d0 U+03D0), theta (\u03d1 U+03D1), phi (\u03d5 U+03D5), pi (\u03d6 U+03D6), kappa (\u03f0 U+03F0), rho (\u03f1 U+03F1), capital theta (\u03f4 U+03F4)\n\nWhile these compatibility characters are distinguished from their compatibility decomposition characters only by adding the word \"symbol\" to their name, they do represent long-standing distinct meanings in written mathematics. However, for all practical purposes they share the same semantics as their compatibility equivalent Greek or Hebrew letter. These may be considered border-line semantically distinguishable characters so they are not included in the total.\n\nThough not the intention of Unicode to encode such measuring units the repertoire includes six (6) such symbols that should not be used by authors: the characters' decompositions should be used instead.\n* Unit symbols (6): [[Angstrom]] (\u00c5 U+212B: use U+00C5 instead), [[Ohm]] (\u03a9, U+2126: use U+03A9 instead), [[Kelvin]] (K U+212A: use U+004B instead), [[Fahrenheit]] (\u2109 U+2109: use [[\u00b0|U+00B0]] and U+0046 instead), [[Celsius]] (\u2103 U+2103: use U+00B0 and U+0043 instead), [[micro-|Micro]] Sign (\u00b5 U+00B5: use U+03BC instead)\n\nUnicode also designates twenty-two (22) other letter-like symbols as compatibility characters.\n* Other Greek letter-based symbols (4): lunate epsilon (\u03f5 U+03F5), lunate sigma (\u03f2 U+03F2), capital lunate sigma (\u03f9 U+03F9), upsilon with hook (\u03d2 U+03D2)\n* Mathematical constants (3): Euler constant ([[\u2107]] U+2107), [[Planck constant]] (\u210e U+210E), [[reduced Planck constant]] (\u210f U+210F),\n* Currency symbols (2): rupee sign (\u20a8 U+20A8), rial sign (\ufdfc U+FDFC)\n* Punctuation (4): one dot leader (U+2024), no-break space (U+00A0), non-breaking hyphen (U+2011), Tibetan mark delimiter tsheg bstar (U+0F0C)\n* Other letter-like symbols (10): information source (\u2139 U+2139), account of (\u2100 U+2100), addressed to the subject (\u2101 U+2101), care of (\u2105 U+2105), cada una (\u2106 U+2106), [[Numero sign|numero]] (\u2116 U+2116), telephone sign (\u2121 U+2121), facsimile sign (\u213b U+213B), trademark (\u2122 U+2122), service mark (\u2120 U+2120)\n\nIn addition, several scripts{{which|date=January 2012}} use glyph position such as superscripts and subscripts to differentiate semantics. In these cases subscripts and superscripts are not merely rich text, but constitute a distinct character \u2014 similar to a hybrid between a diacritic and a letter{{Or|date=January 2012}}<!-- are they [[Spacing modifier character]]s or what? there is no example, so we should guess author's intentions. -->  \u2014 in the writing system (130 total).\n\n* 112 characters representing abstract phonemes from phonetic alphabets such as the  [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] use such positional glyphs to represent semantic differences (U+1D2C \u2013 U+1D6A, U+1D78, U+1D9B \u2013 U+1DBF, U+02B0 \u2013 U+02B8, U+02E0 \u2013 U+02E4 )\n* 14 characters from the [[Kanbun]] block (U+3192 \u2013 U+319F)\n* 1 character from the [[Tifinagh]] script: Tifinagh Modifier Letter Labialization Mark (\u2d6f U+2D6F)\n* 1 character from the [[Georgian script]]: Modifier Letter Georgian Nar (\u10fc U+10FC)\n* masculine ([[\u00ba|U+00BA]]) and feminine ([[\u00aa|U+00AA]]) ordinal indicators included in the Latin-1 supplement{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} block\n\nFinally, Unicode designates Roman numerals as compatibility equivalence to the Latin letters that share the same glyphs.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n* Capital Roman Numerals (7): One (\u2160 U+2160), Five (\u2164 U+2164), Ten (\u2169 U+2169), Fifty (\u216c U+216C), One Hundred (\u216d U+216D), Five Hundred (\u216e U+216E), One Thousand (\u216f U+216F)\n* and lower case variants (7): One (\u2170 U+2170), Five (\u2174 U+2174), Ten (\u2179 U+2179), Fifty (\u217c U+217C), One Hundred (\u217d U+217D), Five Hundred (\u217e U+217E) and One Thousand (\u217f U+217F)\n* 18 precomposed Roman numerals in uppercase and lowercase variants (2\u20134, 6\u20139 and 11\u201312)\n\nRoman numeral One Thousand actually has a third character representing a third form or glyph for the same semantic unit: One Thousand C D (\u2180 U+2180). From this glyph, one can see where the practice of using a Latin M may have arisen. Strangely, though Unicode unifies the [[sign-value notation|sign-value]] Roman numerals with the very different{{citation needed|date=May 2009}} (though visually similar) Latin letters, the Indic Arabic [[place-value]] (positional) decimal digit numerals are repeated 24 times (a total of 240 code points for 10 numerals) throughout the UCS without any relational or decomposition mapping between them.\n\nThe presence of these 167 semantically distinct though visually similar characters (plus the borderline 11 Hebrew and Greek letter based symbols and the 6 measurement unit symbols) among the decomposable characters complicates the topic of compatibility characters. The Unicode standard discourages the use of compatibility characters by content authors. However, in certain specialized areas, these characters are important and quite similar to other characters that have not been included among the compatibility characters. For example, in certain academic circles the use of Roman numerals as distinct from Latin letters that share the same glyphs would be no different from the use of Cuneiform numerals or ancient Greek numerals. Collapsing the Roman numeral characters to Latin letter characters eliminates a semantic distinction. A similar situation exists for phonetic alphabet characters that use subscript or superscript positioned glyphs. In the specialized circles that use phonetic alphabets, authors should be able to do so without resorting to rich text protocols. As another example the keyword 'circle' compatibility characters are often used for describing the game [[Go (game)|Go]]. However, these uses of the compatibility characters constitute exceptions where the author has a special reason to use the otherwise discouraged characters.\n\n== Compatibility blocks ==\nSeveral blocks of Unicode characters include either entirely or almost entirely all compatibility characters (U+F900\u2013U+FFEF except for the nonchars). The compatibility blocks contain none of the semantically distinct compatibility characters with only one exception: the rial currency symbol (\ufdfc U+FDFC) so the compatibility decomposable characters in the compatibility blocks fall unambiguously into the set of discouraged characters. Unicode recommends authors use the plain text compatibility decomposition equivalents instead and complement those characters with rich text markup. This approach is much more flexible and open-ended than using the finite set of circled or enclosed alphanumerics to give just one example.\n\nUnfortunately, there are a small number of characters even within the compatibility blocks that themselves are not compatibility characters and therefore may confuse authors. The \"Enclosed CJK Letters and Months\" block contains a single non-compatibility character: the 'Korean Standard Symbol' (\u327f U+327F). That symbol and 12 other characters have been included in the blocks for unknown reasons. The \"CJK Compatibility Ideographs\" block contains these non-compatibility unified Han ideographs:\n\n# (U+FA0E): \ufa0e\n# (U+FA0F): \ufa0f\n# (U+FA11): \ufa11\n# (U+FA13): \ufa13\n# (U+FA14): \ufa14\n# (U+FA1F): \ufa1f\n# (U+FA21): \ufa21\n# (U+FA23): \ufa23\n# (U+FA24): \ufa24\n# (U+FA27): \ufa27\n# (U+FA28): \ufa28\n# (U+FA29): \ufa29\n\nThese thirteen characters are not compatibility characters, and their use is not discouraged in any way. However, U+27EAF \ud85f\udeaf, the same as U+FA23 \ufa23, is mistakenly encoded in CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B.<ref>[http://appsrv.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~irg/irg/irg26/IRGN1218_Response_to_WG2.pdf#page=4 IRGN 1218]</ref> In any event, a normalized text should never contain both U+27EAF \ud85f\udeaf and U+FA23 \ufa23; these code points represent the same character, encoded twice.\n\nSeveral other characters in these blocks have no compatibility mapping but are clearly intended for legacy support:\n\nAlphabetic Presentation Forms (1)\n# Hebrew Point Judeo-Spanish Varika (U+FB1E): \ufb1e. This is a glyph variant of Hebrew Point [[Rafe (diacritic)|Rafe]] (U+05BF): \u05bf, though Unicode provides no compatibility mapping.\n\nArabic Presentation Forms (4)\n# \"Ornate Left Parenthesis\" (U+FD3E): \ufd3e.

This is similar to other operations needed when, for example, a user performs a case or diacritic insensitive search within some text. In such cases software must equate or ignore characters it would not otherwise equate or ignore.  Typically normalization is performed without altering the underlying stored text data (lossless). However, some software may potentially make permanent changes to text that eliminates the canonical or even non-canonical compatibility characters differences from text storage (lossy).\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://ctext.org/faq/normalization Normalization (Chinese Text Project)] - Unicode normalization issues in classical Chinese, with list of normalized CJK codepoints\n\n{{Unicode navigation}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Unicode Compatibility Characters}}\n[[Category:Unicode]]\n", "name_user": "Tea2min", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Hyphenation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_compatibility_characters"}

It includes a contemporary [[carillon]]. The Park is administered by Olympiapark M\u00fcnchen GmbH, a holding company fully owned by the state capital of Munich.\n\n== Location and structure ==\nThe use of the term ''Olympiapark'' to designate the overall area has prevailed as a semiofficial practice, but no official name for the entire area exists. \n\nThe general area comprises four separate sub-areas:<ref name  =Otto>Otto Haas, Wolfgang K\u00f6sler (Red.): Offizieller Olympiaf\u00fchrer der Spiele der XX.

Strictly speaking, this portion belongs to the area of district of \"Moosach.\"\n* '''Olympic Park''':  Adjoining the Olympic Area to the south, this park includes the Olympic Mountain and Olympic Lake.\n\nThe park is located in the [[Milbertshofen-Am Hart]] borough near [[BMW]] Group headquarters and the \"[[Uptown Munich|Uptown]]\" skyscraper of [[Telef\u00f3nica Europe|O2]]. Georg-Brauchle-Ring divides the area into two halves: Olympic Village and Olympia Pressestadt to the north and Olympic Area and Olympic Park to the south.<ref name  =Otto/>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Munich Olympiapark Public Viewing SCG-NED (0-1).jpg|thumb|Public viewing during [[FIFA World Cup 2006]]]]\n[[File:Wm-oly-de-cr.jpg|thumb|Supporters assisting at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup Group A#Germany vs Costa Rica|opening match]] of the finals tournament of 2006 FIFA World Cup]]\nAfter the International Olympic Committee in 1966 awarded Munich the Olympic Games, plans were solidified for the urban redevelopment of the Oberwiesenfeld area. Up until 1939, [[Oberwiesenfeld]] had largely been used as an airfield; however, the recently opened [[Munich-Riem airport]] resulted in the Oberwiesenfeld area being superseded and largely idle. \n\nIn the 1930s the [[Nazi]] Party planned to develop Munich as the \"Capital of the Movement,\" with this area to serve as the central slaughterhouse and marketplace of the city. The Second World War hindered implementation of this plan. After 1945, the Oberwiesenfeld area remained fallow, and was known as a ''\"Tr\u00fcmmerberg,\"'' which in German refers to a hill erected from the ruins caused by the destruction caused by bombings during the war. \n\nFollowing the war, the US Army occupied this area and had facilities at the Oberwiesefeld. In October 1957, the Army housed most of the refugees from the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] in a camp at this facility. Apart from infrastructure projects such as the Oberwiesenfeld Ice Rink, Oberwiesenfeld remained largely vacant during the ensuing decades. It presented an ideal site for the construction of the Olympic Stadium and complex.\n[[File:Olympic Roof Munich, July 2018 -02.jpg|thumb|Detail of the tensile membrane roof]]\nGermany chose the concept of a \"green Olympic Games\", with an emphasis on democratic ideals. Officials sought to integrate optimism toward the future with a positive attitude toward technology, and in so doing set aside memories of the past, such as the Olympic Games of 1936 in [[Berlin]] under Hitler. The architecture firm of G\u00fcnther Behnisch and its partners developed a comprehensive master plan for the sports and recreation area, which was under construction from 1968 until 1972. The landscape layout was designed by landscape architect [[G\u00fcnther Grzimek]]. The eye-catching [[tensile structure]] that covers much of the park was designed by [[Germany|German]] architect and engineer [[Frei Otto]] with [[G\u00fcnther Behnisch]]. In all, the project cost 1.35 billion German marks to complete.\n\nThe name \"Olympiapark\" was related to the city's administrative commission practice for naming metro stations along the U- and S-Bahn routes in the city area. On 3 November 1969 it had chosen the name \"Olympiapark\" for the name of the [[Olympiazentrum (Munich U-Bahn)|Olympic station's]] stop along the U3 line of the [[Munich U-Bahn]]. This naming decision was basted  on the idea that the name \"Olympiapark\" related well to the central theme of a \"green Olympic Games\". It also related to the central function of the U-Bahn station, which, together with the bus station, served all sports venues and important sectors of the area. The term quickly entered into quasi-official common parlance, and consequently into media use. In most situations, the meaning established by the administrative commission is used to describe the entire area, not just the U-Bahn station, as was originally intended.<ref>{{cite web|last=j|first=m|title=mr|url=http://www.flyingmast.com/?p=181|accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Transportation==\n\nUsing public transportation, the [[Munich U-Bahn]]'s U3 line provides a direct route: From [[M\u00fcnchner Freiheit]] (a plaza in the Munich district of [[Schwabing]], located on Leopoldstra\u00dfe), the line connects to Olympiapark via Schwabing and the midtown area. In 2007, the U3 line was extended to continue on to [[Oberwiesenfeld (Munich U-Bahn)|Oberwiesenfeld station]] at the northern end of the Olympic Village and Olympia-Einkaufszentrum mall at the far areas of the Park. The continuation to [[Munich Moosach station|Moosach]], where the line connects to the S1 [[Munich S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] line, was completed in 2010. [[Olympiazentrum (Munich U-Bahn)|Olympiazentrum]] U-Bahn station is a central stop for the [[M\u00fcnchner Verkehrsgesellschaft|MVG bus]] line. The southern and western portions of the Olympiapark will also be connected via [[Munich tramway|Munich tram]] lines 12, 20, 21, and 27. As these areas are remote from the northern part of Olympiapark, they are primarily of interest for the annual Tollwood music festival held there each summer.\n\nAfter the 1972 Olympic Games, the [[M\u00fcnchen Olympiastadion station|Olympiastadion Station]] was disconnected from regular networks. It was used for some events, but the station was closed in 1988 and the tracks taken up in 2003. It has been abandoned and continues to decay.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThe Olympiapark is accessible by car via Mittlerer Ring motorway. The Olympic Village is closed off from car traffic.\n\n== Olympic Area in detail ==\n\n[[File:Olympiaturm 1.jpg|thumb|right|Olympiaturm]]\nThe Olympic Area lies south of Georg-Brauchle-Ring and north of the Olympiasee lake; it is the smallest portion of the entire Olympiapark area. It comprises the following competition sites:<ref name  =Otto/>\n\n=== Olympic Stadium ===\n\n{{main|Olympic Stadium, Munich}}\nThe central Stadium, constructed from 1968 to 1972, was designed by the architecture firm of Behnisch and Partners. It is currently home to the highest number of staged national and international competitions in Germany. Originally constructed to hold 80,000 visitors, this number was reduced at the end of the 1990s to 69,000 due to security concerns. After the Olympic Games, the Stadium was used primarily for football matches and served as the home stadium for the football teams FC Bayern M\u00fcnchen and TSV 1860 M\u00fcnchen. Since the opening of the [[Allianz Arena]] in 2005, the site is used almost exclusively for cultural events.\n\n[[File:Olympiahalle.jpg|thumb|right|Olympic Hall and Aquatic Center]]\n{{Multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| total_width = 230\n| image1 = Olympic park 12.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = Partial view of The Olympiapark (a view down of the [[Olympiaturm]] to the [[Olympic Stadium, Munich|Olympic Stadium]], on the right: [[Olympiahalle|Olympia Halle]], left: [[Olympia_Schwimmhalle|Schwimmhalle]])\n| image2 = Olympark.JPG\n| caption2 = General view of the Schwimmhalle, park, pond and communication tower\n}}\n=== Olympic Hall ===\n\n{{main|Olympiahalle}}\nAlso designed by the architecture firm of Behnisch and Partners, Olympic Hall is a sport and recreational facility located northeast of the Olympic Stadium. Its capacity is 12,150 with seats, or 14,000 without seats.\n\n=== Small Olympic Hall ===\n\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\nSmaller event facility at the Olympic Hall for up to 1,000 seated individuals, according to stage size.\n\n=== Aquatic Center ===\n\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n{{main|Olympia Schwimmhalle}}\nThis venue became an integral part of Olympic history when the US swimmer Mark Spitz won 7 gold medals there during the 1972 Munich Games. This amounted to a remarkable comeback for Mark Spitz, who had fallen short of the 5 gold medals expected of him at the 1968 Mexico Olympics. The venue also saw significant success by the young women's team of the GDR, which was later found - albeit, the matter was essentially an open secret - to be the result of an extensive [[doping in sports|doping]] programme.\n\nOne notable feature of the Munich ''Schwimmhalle'' is the way in which the cobbled paths leading to the venue continue under the canopy as far as the top of the seating area, thus creating the genuine impression of walking in off the street to one's seat.  The venue is available both to swimming teams and also to the public.\n\n=== Olympic Icesportcenter ===\n\nThe Olympic Icestadion was built from April 1965 by the plans of Rolf Sch\u00fctze and opened on 12 February 1967 with the [[ice hockey]] game between [[FC Bayern Munich]] and [[SC Riessersee]]. After using it for the 1969 World Table Tennis Championships, the Icestadion was used for the Olympic Summer games 1972 for the Boxsports. The stadium has a capacity for 6,142 visitors<ref>http://www.redbullmuenchen.de/stadion</ref> and is used for the games of the team of [[EHC Red Bull M\u00fcnchen]] at the [[Deutsche Eishockey Liga]].\n\nOn the left site of the Icestadion stands an open air ice skating rink. In 1980 it was decided to build a roof over the open air rink in order to have it operational during the whole year independent of the weather conditions.<ref>Tensinet {{cite web |url=http://www.tensinet.com/database/viewProject/3834 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032713/http://www.tensinet.com/database/viewProject/3834 |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The German architectural firm Ackermann und Partner designed an elegant light-weight tensile structure spanning 100 meters length-wise.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ackermann und Partner project description|url=http://www.ackermann-partner.com/_scripts/project_popup.php?id=33&bild=4|publisher=Ackermann Architekten BDA|language=German|accessdate=April 26, 2017}}</ref> The building was completed in 1983. In 2004 the ice skating rink was closed and is now used to play Indoorsoccer.\n\nOn the right side of the Icestadion 1991 the new training hall for the Icesport world championship was built over the parking area after the plans of Kurt Ackermann<ref>{{cite web|title=Leistungszentrum f\u00fcr Eiskunstlauf im Olympiapark|url=http://www.ackermannarchitekten.com/entry/leistungszentrum-fuer-eiskunstlauf-im-olympiapark/|publisher=Ackermann Architekten BDA|language=German|accessdate=April 26, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Velodrome  ===\n\n{{main|Radstadion}}\n\n=== Olympic Tower ===\n\n{{main|Olympiaturm}}\n\nThe '''Olympiaturm''' has an overall height of 291 m and a weight of 52,500 tonnes. At a height of 190 m there is an observation platform as well as a small rock and roll museum housing various memorabilia. Since its opening in 1968 the tower has registered over 35 million visitors (as of 2004). At a height of 182 m there is a revolving restaurant that seats 230 people. A full revolution takes 53 minutes. The tower has one [[Deutsche Telekom]] maintenance elevator with a speed of 4&nbsp;m/s, as well as two visitor lifts with a speed of 7&nbsp;m/s which have a capacity of about 30 people per cabin. The travel time from the ground to the viewing platform is about 30 seconds.\n\n=== Olympic Village ===\n{{main|Olympic Village, Munich|Munich massacre}}\nThis was the site of the [[Munich massacre]] in the second week of the Games, when eleven of the Israeli team and a West German policeman were murdered by [[Black September]] Palestinian terrorists.\n* '''Olympic Village'''\n* '''Student District'''\n\n=== Olympia Pressestadt ===\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\nThe Olympia Pressestadt lies west of the Olympiapark between [[Landshuter Allee]] in the east and Riesstra\u00dfe in the west. It is the site of the former media center and today provides regular housing.\n\n==== Carillon ====\n\nThe carillon, built in 1972, was one of five carillons in Bavaria. Rather than occupying a traditional bell tower, it was set on an open framework with the bells exposed to view. It was built for the 1972 Summer Olympics on Coubertinplatz, the central square in the Olympic Park. It was made by the Dutch bell foundry Eijsbouts and has a range of 50 bells (originally 49 bells, 1991 retrofit a Cis bell).\n\nIn 2007, the Olympic Carillon was dismantled due to restructuring measures in the Olympic Park. It was reinstalled in 2012, with American carilloneur Jim Saenger \"ringing in\" the rebuilt carillon with a concert on April 16, 2012.<ref>https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-apr-16-2012-carillon-at-olympic-park-in-munich-west-germany-rung-in-69549957.html. Retrieved December 13, 2018.</ref>\n\n==== Munich Olympic Walk Of Stars ====\nIn 2003 the Munich Olympic Walk of Stars was constructed as a path from the Olympic Sea, als Weg am Olympiasee, in the style of the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].

It includes a contemporary [[carillon]]. The Park is administered by Olympiapark M\u00fcnchen GmbH, a holding company fully owned by the state capital of Munich.\n\n== Location and structure ==\nThe use of the term ''Olympiapark'' to designate the overall area has prevailed as a semiofficial practice, but no official name for the entire area exists. \n\nThe general area comprises four separate sub-areas:<ref name  =Otto>Otto Haas, Wolfgang K\u00f6sler (Red.): Offizieller Olympiaf\u00fchrer der Spiele der XX.

Georg-Brauchle-Ring divides the area into two halves: Olympic Village and Olympia Pressestadt to the north and Olympic Area and Olympic Park to the south.<ref name  =Otto/>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Munich Olympiapark Public Viewing SCG-NED (0-1).jpg|thumb|Public viewing during [[FIFA World Cup 2006]]]]\n[[File:Wm-oly-de-cr.jpg|thumb|Supporters assisting at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup Group A#Germany vs Costa Rica|opening match]] of the finals tournament of 2006 FIFA World Cup]]\nAfter the International Olympic Committee in 1966 awarded Munich the Olympic Games, plans were solidified for the urban redevelopment of the Oberwiesenfeld area. Up until 1939, [[Oberwiesenfeld]] had largely been used as an airfield; however, the recently opened [[Munich-Riem airport]] resulted in the Oberwiesenfeld area being superseded and largely idle. \n\nIn the 1930s the [[Nazi]] Party planned to develop Munich as the \"Capital of the Movement,\" with this area to serve as the central slaughterhouse and marketplace of the city. The Second World War hindered implementation of this plan. After 1945, the Oberwiesenfeld area remained fallow, and was known as a ''\"Tr\u00fcmmerberg,\"'' which in German refers to a hill erected from the ruins caused by the destruction caused by bombings during the war. \n\nFollowing the war, the US Army occupied this area and had facilities at the Oberwiesefeld. In October 1957, the Army housed most of the refugees from the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] in a camp at this facility. Apart from infrastructure projects such as the Oberwiesenfeld Ice Rink, Oberwiesenfeld remained largely vacant during the ensuing decades. It presented an ideal site for the construction of the Olympic Stadium and complex.\n[[File:Olympic Roof Munich, July 2018 -02.jpg|thumb|Detail of the tensile membrane roof]]\nGermany chose the concept of a \"green Olympic Games\", with an emphasis on democratic ideals. Officials sought to integrate optimism toward the future with a positive attitude toward technology, and in so doing set aside memories of the past, such as the Olympic Games of 1936 in [[Berlin]] under Hitler. The architecture firm of G\u00fcnther Behnisch and its partners developed a comprehensive master plan for the sports and recreation area, which was under construction from 1968 until 1972. The landscape layout was designed by landscape architect [[G\u00fcnther Grzimek]]. The eye-catching [[tensile structure]] that covers much of the park was designed by [[Germany|German]] architect and engineer [[Frei Otto]] with [[G\u00fcnther Behnisch]]. In all, the project cost 1.35 billion German marks to complete.\n\nThe name \"Olympiapark\" was related to the city's administrative commission practice for naming metro stations along the U- and S-Bahn routes in the city area. On 3 November 1969 it had chosen the name \"Olympiapark\" for the name of the [[Olympiazentrum (Munich U-Bahn)|Olympic station's]] stop along the U3 line of the [[Munich U-Bahn]]. This naming decision was based on the idea that the name \"Olympiapark\" related well to the central theme of a \"green Olympic Games\". It also related to the central function of the U-Bahn station, which, together with the bus station, served all sports venues and important sectors of the area. The term quickly entered into quasi-official common parlance, and consequently into media use. In most situations, the meaning established by the administrative commission is used to describe the entire area, not just the U-Bahn station, as was originally intended.<ref>{{cite web|last=j|first=m|title=mr|url=http://www.flyingmast.com/?p=181|accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Transportation==\n\nUsing public transportation, the [[Munich U-Bahn]]'s U3 line provides a direct route: From [[M\u00fcnchner Freiheit]] (a plaza in the Munich district of [[Schwabing]], located on Leopoldstra\u00dfe), the line connects to Olympiapark via Schwabing and the midtown area. In 2007, the U3 line was extended to continue on to [[Oberwiesenfeld (Munich U-Bahn)|Oberwiesenfeld station]] at the northern end of the Olympic Village and Olympia-Einkaufszentrum mall at the far areas of the Park. The continuation to [[Munich Moosach station|Moosach]], where the line connects to the S1 [[Munich S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] line, was completed in 2010. [[Olympiazentrum (Munich U-Bahn)|Olympiazentrum]] U-Bahn station is a central stop for the [[M\u00fcnchner Verkehrsgesellschaft|MVG bus]] line. The southern and western portions of the Olympiapark will also be connected via [[Munich tramway|Munich tram]] lines 12, 20, 21, and 27. As these areas are remote from the northern part of Olympiapark, they are primarily of interest for the annual Tollwood music festival held there each summer.\n\nAfter the 1972 Olympic Games, the [[M\u00fcnchen Olympiastadion station|Olympiastadion Station]] was disconnected from regular networks. It was used for some events, but the station was closed in 1988 and the tracks taken up in 2003. It has been abandoned and continues to decay.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThe Olympiapark is accessible by car via Mittlerer Ring motorway. The Olympic Village is closed off from car traffic.\n\n== Olympic Area in detail ==\n\n[[File:Olympiaturm 1.jpg|thumb|right|Olympiaturm]]\nThe Olympic Area lies south of Georg-Brauchle-Ring and north of the Olympiasee lake; it is the smallest portion of the entire Olympiapark area. It comprises the following competition sites:<ref name  =Otto/>\n\n=== Olympic Stadium ===\n\n{{main|Olympic Stadium, Munich}}\nThe central Stadium, constructed from 1968 to 1972, was designed by the architecture firm of Behnisch and Partners. It is currently home to the highest number of staged national and international competitions in Germany. Originally constructed to hold 80,000 visitors, this number was reduced at the end of the 1990s to 69,000 due to security concerns. After the Olympic Games, the Stadium was used primarily for football matches and served as the home stadium for the football teams FC Bayern M\u00fcnchen and TSV 1860 M\u00fcnchen. Since the opening of the [[Allianz Arena]] in 2005, the site is used almost exclusively for cultural events.\n\n[[File:Olympiahalle.jpg|thumb|right|Olympic Hall and Aquatic Center]]\n{{Multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| total_width = 230\n| image1 = Olympic park 12.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = Partial view of The Olympiapark (a view down of the [[Olympiaturm]] to the [[Olympic Stadium, Munich|Olympic Stadium]], on the right: [[Olympiahalle|Olympia Halle]], left: [[Olympia_Schwimmhalle|Schwimmhalle]])\n| image2 = Olympark.JPG\n| caption2 = General view of the Schwimmhalle, park, pond and communication tower\n}}\n=== Olympic Hall ===\n\n{{main|Olympiahalle}}\nAlso designed by the architecture firm of Behnisch and Partners, Olympic Hall is a sport and recreational facility located northeast of the Olympic Stadium. Its capacity is 12,150 with seats, or 14,000 without seats.\n\n=== Small Olympic Hall ===\n\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\nSmaller event facility at the Olympic Hall for up to 1,000 seated individuals, according to stage size.\n\n=== Aquatic Center ===\n\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n{{main|Olympia Schwimmhalle}}\nThis venue became an integral part of Olympic history when the US swimmer Mark Spitz won 7 gold medals there during the 1972 Munich Games. This amounted to a remarkable comeback for Mark Spitz, who had fallen short of the 5 gold medals expected of him at the 1968 Mexico Olympics. The venue also saw significant success by the young women's team of the GDR, which was later found - albeit, the matter was essentially an open secret - to be the result of an extensive [[doping in sports|doping]] programme.\n\nOne notable feature of the Munich ''Schwimmhalle'' is the way in which the cobbled paths leading to the venue continue under the canopy as far as the top of the seating area, thus creating the genuine impression of walking in off the street to one's seat.  The venue is available both to swimming teams and also to the public.\n\n=== Olympic Icesportcenter ===\n\nThe Olympic Icestadion was built from April 1965 by the plans of Rolf Sch\u00fctze and opened on 12 February 1967 with the [[ice hockey]] game between [[FC Bayern Munich]] and [[SC Riessersee]]. After using it for the 1969 World Table Tennis Championships, the Icestadion was used for the Olympic Summer games 1972 for the Boxsports. The stadium has a capacity for 6,142 visitors<ref>http://www.redbullmuenchen.de/stadion</ref> and is used for the games of the team of [[EHC Red Bull M\u00fcnchen]] at the [[Deutsche Eishockey Liga]].\n\nOn the left site of the Icestadion stands an open air ice skating rink. In 1980 it was decided to build a roof over the open air rink in order to have it operational during the whole year independent of the weather conditions.<ref>Tensinet {{cite web |url=http://www.tensinet.com/database/viewProject/3834 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032713/http://www.tensinet.com/database/viewProject/3834 |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The German architectural firm Ackermann und Partner designed an elegant light-weight tensile structure spanning 100 meters length-wise.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ackermann und Partner project description|url=http://www.ackermann-partner.com/_scripts/project_popup.php?id=33&bild=4|publisher=Ackermann Architekten BDA|language=German|accessdate=April 26, 2017}}</ref> The building was completed in 1983. In 2004 the ice skating rink was closed and is now used to play Indoorsoccer.\n\nOn the right side of the Icestadion 1991 the new training hall for the Icesport world championship was built over the parking area after the plans of Kurt Ackermann<ref>{{cite web|title=Leistungszentrum f\u00fcr Eiskunstlauf im Olympiapark|url=http://www.ackermannarchitekten.com/entry/leistungszentrum-fuer-eiskunstlauf-im-olympiapark/|publisher=Ackermann Architekten BDA|language=German|accessdate=April 26, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Velodrome  ===\n\n{{main|Radstadion}}\n\n=== Olympic Tower ===\n\n{{main|Olympiaturm}}\n\nThe '''Olympiaturm''' has an overall height of 291 m and a weight of 52,500 tonnes. At a height of 190 m there is an observation platform as well as a small rock and roll museum housing various memorabilia. Since its opening in 1968 the tower has registered over 35 million visitors (as of 2004). At a height of 182 m there is a revolving restaurant that seats 230 people. A full revolution takes 53 minutes. The tower has one [[Deutsche Telekom]] maintenance elevator with a speed of 4&nbsp;m/s, as well as two visitor lifts with a speed of 7&nbsp;m/s which have a capacity of about 30 people per cabin. The travel time from the ground to the viewing platform is about 30 seconds.\n\n=== Olympic Village ===\n{{main|Olympic Village, Munich|Munich massacre}}\nThis was the site of the [[Munich massacre]] in the second week of the Games, when eleven of the Israeli team and a West German policeman were murdered by [[Black September]] Palestinian terrorists.\n* '''Olympic Village'''\n* '''Student District'''\n\n=== Olympia Pressestadt ===\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\nThe Olympia Pressestadt lies west of the Olympiapark between [[Landshuter Allee]] in the east and Riesstra\u00dfe in the west. It is the site of the former media center and today provides regular housing.\n\n==== Carillon ====\n\nThe carillon, built in 1972, was one of five carillons in Bavaria. Rather than occupying a traditional bell tower, it was set on an open framework with the bells exposed to view. It was built for the 1972 Summer Olympics on Coubertinplatz, the central square in the Olympic Park. It was made by the Dutch bell foundry Eijsbouts and has a range of 50 bells (originally 49 bells, 1991 retrofit a Cis bell).\n\nIn 2007, the Olympic Carillon was dismantled due to restructuring measures in the Olympic Park. It was reinstalled in 2012, with American carilloneur Jim Saenger \"ringing in\" the rebuilt carillon with a concert on April 16, 2012.<ref>https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-apr-16-2012-carillon-at-olympic-park-in-munich-west-germany-rung-in-69549957.html. Retrieved December 13, 2018.</ref>\n\n==== Munich Olympic Walk Of Stars ====\nIn 2003 the Munich Olympic Walk of Stars was constructed as a path from the Olympic Sea, als Weg am Olympiasee, in the style of the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. Celebrities leave their hand- and footprints behind in the concrete. Singer Howard Carpendale was the first to do so, and since then roughly 30 personalities from culture and sport have left impressions of themselves behind.\n\n== Regular events (apart from concerts) ==\n[[File:Red Bull Crashed Ice 2010 Strecke mit Start.jpg|thumb|Red Bull Crashed Ice 2010]]\n[[File:M\u00fcnchner Sommernachtstraum.jpg|thumb|Musikfireworks show at the M\u00fcnchner Sommernachtstraum 2018]]\nThe Olympiapark host a number of regular events on a yearly basis\u02d0<ref>Katrin Schulze: Der Park als Spiellandschaft \u2013 zum Spielkonzept von 1972 f\u00fcr den Olympiapark M\u00fcnchen.

It was designed by the architect [[Albert Edward Lambert]], who also designed the rebuild of the Nottingham Midland station (now known simply as [[Nottingham railway station|Nottingham Station]]).\n\nIt was opened by the [[Nottingham Joint Station Committee]] on 24 May 1900 and closed on 4 September 1967 by the [[London Midland Region|London Midland Region of British Railways]]. The station building was entirely demolished (except the clock tower), and the [[Victoria Centre, Nottingham|Victoria Centre]] shopping centre was built on the site, incorporating the old station clock tower into the main entrance on Milton Street (the continuation of Mansfield Road).\n\n==Background==\n\nIn 1893 the [[Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway]] obtained authorisation to extend its North Midlands railway network into London. This new line was opened on 15 March 1899 and became known as the [[Great Central Main Line|London Extension]], stretching from Annesley to a new station at [[Marylebone station|Marylebone]] in London. The line passed through Nottingham, where a new station was to be built.\n\n==Construction and opening==\n[[Image:Nottingham Victoria Station 1.jpg|thumb|right|Station interior in the years after opening.]]\nThe station's construction was on a grand scale: a {{convert|13|acre|m2|adj=on}} site was acquired at a cost of \u00a3473,000 (\u00a3{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|473000|1898|r=-4}}}}){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} in the heart of Nottingham's city centre; negotiations for the land acquisition had taken three years. The construction called for the demolition of whole streets of some 1,300 houses, 24 [[public houses]], and [[St. Stephen's Church, Bunker's Hill]], following which about {{convert|600000|cuyd|m3}} of [[sandstone]] was excavated from the site. The site measured about {{convert|650|yd|m}} in length from north to south and had an average width of {{convert|110|yd|m}}, with a tunnel at each end for access.<ref name=\"Dow12\">{{Cite book | last=Dow |first=George | authorlink=George Dow | title=Great Central, Volume Three: Fay Sets the Pace, 1900\u20131922 | date=1965 | publisher=[[Ian Allan Publishing|Ian Allan]] | location=London | isbn=0-7110-0263-0 | page=12 |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Great Central Railway]] and [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] shared the station (they split into two lines at [[Weekday Cross]] junction). The two owners failed to reach agreement on the station's name; the Great Central naturally wanted it called \"Central\", a proposition the Great Northern, still smarting from the incursion into its territory made by the London Extension, would not accept. The two railway companies operated separate booking offices, the Great Central issuing tickets reading \"Nottingham Central\", whilst the Great Northern's window bore the name \"Nottingham Joint St'n\". In the 1898 Royal Atlas of England, the station was recorded as the \"Grt Central & Grt Northern Joint Central Station\".<ref>John Bartholomew, [http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~genmaps/genfiles/COU_files/ENG/NTT/bartholomew_nottingham_1898.html The Royal Atlas of England], 1898</ref> The [[Town Clerk|town clerk]] resolved the situation by suggesting the name \"Nottingham Victoria\" to reflect the fact that the planned opening date coincided with [[Queen Victoria]]'s birthday; this was readily accepted at a meeting of the Nottingham Joint Station Committee on 12 June.<ref name=\"Dow16\">{{harvnb|Dow|1965|p=16}}</ref>\n\nNottingham Victoria station was officially opened without ceremony in the early hours of 24 May 1900, over a year after the commencement of services on the new railway line. The first service to call at the station was a Great Central express from [[Manchester Piccadilly railway station|Manchester]] to [[London Marylebone|Marylebone]], which pulled in at 1:12 a.m.; it was followed fifteen minutes later by a Great Central express travelling in the opposite direction.<ref name=\"Dow16\"/>\n\n==Station building==\n[[Image:Nottingham Victoria Station.jpg|left|thumb|Nottingham Victoria Station in the early 1900s. On the right of the picture is the Victoria Hotel, now a [[Hilton Hotels|Hilton]] hotel.]]\nThe main station building was in true [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] splendour. It was constructed in a [[Renaissance style]] using the best-quality red-faced bricks and [[Darley Dale]] stone, with space at the front for [[Hackney carriages]], which was covered by a canopy. It faced onto the confluence of Mansfield Road and Milton Street for some {{convert|250|ft|m}}.<ref name=\"Dow12\" />\n\nThe three-storey building was dominated by a {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} [[clock tower]] topped with a [[cupola]] and [[weather vane]]. At the north end of the building, access could be gained to the parcels office via two large metal gates. Once inside the building on the ground floor level, one reached the large and lofty booking hall. It was over {{convert|100|ft|m}} long and {{convert|66|ft|m}} wide, and contained the best-quality pine and a hard-wearing oak floor, along with a gallery on each side to gain access to spacious offices on the first floor. The booking hall contained seven ticket-issuing windows, three each for the Great Central and Great Northern and one for excursion traffic; a clock-type train indicator served all platforms. An iron overbridge led from the booking hall and spanned the platforms, to which it was connected by four broad staircases. A small footbridge at the end provided access to the [[island platform]]s at the south end, themselves connected to a side exit leading onto Parliament Street.<ref name=\"Dow12\"/>\n[[File:Nottingham Victoria railway station 2058984 d4d6fe34.jpg|thumb|right|The station in 1959]]\n\nThe station itself comprised two large island platforms, each between {{convert|1250|ft|m}} and {{convert|1270|ft|m}} long, with two bays at each end for local traffic, giving a total of 12 platform faces. On each island platform were dining and tea rooms together with kitchens, sleeping facilities for staff, waiting rooms, and lavatories. All these buildings were, like the rest of the station, lined with glazed tiles, which were generally buff in colour and embellished with a chocolate [[Dado (architecture)|dado]].  Large {{convert|42|ft|6|in|m}} steel pillars held up an enormous three-part glazed canopy measuring {{convert|450|ft|m}} in length, with a centre span of {{convert|83|ft|3|in|m}} and a pair of flanking spans each of {{convert|63|ft|9|in|m}}.

Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] railway station in [[Nottingham]], England. It was designed by the architect [[Albert Edward Lambert]], who also designed the rebuild of the Nottingham Midland station (now known simply as [[Nottingham railway station|Nottingham Station]]).\n\nIt was opened by the [[Nottingham Joint Station Committee]] on 24 May 1900 and closed on 4 September 1967 by the [[London Midland Region|London Midland Region of British Railways]]. The station building was entirely demolished (except the clock tower), and the [[Victoria Centre, Nottingham|Victoria Centre]] shopping centre was built on the site, incorporating the old station clock tower into the main entrance on Milton Street (the continuation of Mansfield Road).\n\n==Background==\n\nIn 1893 the [[Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway]] obtained authorisation to extend its North Midlands railway network into London. This new line was opened on 15 March 1899 and became known as the [[Great Central Main Line|London Extension]], stretching from Annesley to a new station at [[Marylebone station|Marylebone]] in London. The line passed through Nottingham, where a new station was to be built.\n\n==Construction and opening==\n[[Image:Nottingham Victoria Station 1.jpg|thumb|right|Station interior in the years after opening.]]\nThe station's construction was on a grand scale: a {{convert|13|acre|m2|adj=on}} site was acquired at a cost of \u00a3473,000 (\u00a3{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|473000|1898|r=-4}}}}){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} in the heart of Nottingham's city centre; negotiations for the land acquisition had taken three years. The construction called for the demolition of whole streets of some 1,300 houses, 24 [[public houses]], and [[St. Stephen's Church, Bunker's Hill]], following which about {{convert|600000|cuyd|m3}} of [[sandstone]] was excavated from the site. The site measured about {{convert|650|yd|m}} in length from north to south and had an average width of {{convert|110|yd|m}}, with a tunnel at each end for access.<ref name=\"Dow12\">{{Cite book | last=Dow |first=George | authorlink=George Dow | title=Great Central, Volume Three: Fay Sets the Pace, 1900\u20131922 | date=1965 | publisher=[[Ian Allan Publishing|Ian Allan]] | location=London | isbn=0-7110-0263-0 | page=12 |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Great Central Railway]] and [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] shared the station (they split into two lines at [[Weekday Cross]] junction). The two owners failed to reach agreement on the station's name; the Great Central naturally wanted it called \"Central\", a proposition the Great Northern, still smarting from the incursion into its territory made by the London Extension, would not accept. The two railway companies operated separate booking offices, the Great Central issuing tickets reading \"Nottingham Central\", whilst the Great Northern's window bore the name \"Nottingham Joint St'n\". In the 1898 Royal Atlas of England, the station was recorded as the \"Grt Central & Grt Northern Joint Central Station\".<ref>John Bartholomew, [http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~genmaps/genfiles/COU_files/ENG/NTT/bartholomew_nottingham_1898.html The Royal Atlas of England], 1898</ref> The [[Town Clerk|town clerk]] resolved the situation by suggesting the name \"Nottingham Victoria\" to reflect the fact that the planned opening date coincided with [[Queen Victoria]]'s birthday; this was readily accepted at a meeting of the Nottingham Joint Station Committee on 12 June.<ref name=\"Dow16\">{{harvnb|Dow|1965|p=16}}</ref>\n\nNottingham Victoria station was officially opened without ceremony in the early hours of 24 May 1900, over a year after the commencement of services on the new railway line. The first service to call at the station was a Great Central express from [[Manchester Piccadilly railway station|Manchester]] to [[London Marylebone|Marylebone]], which pulled in at 1:12 a.m.; it was followed fifteen minutes later by a Great Central express travelling in the opposite direction.<ref name=\"Dow16\"/>\n\n==Station building==\n[[Image:Nottingham Victoria Station.jpg|left|thumb|Nottingham Victoria Station in the early 1900s. On the right of the picture is the Victoria Hotel, now a [[Hilton Hotels|Hilton]] hotel.]]\nThe main station building was in true [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] splendour. It was constructed in a [[Renaissance style]] using the best-quality red-faced bricks and [[Darley Dale]] stone, with space at the front for [[Hackney carriages]], which was covered by a canopy. It faced onto the confluence of Mansfield Road and Milton Street for some {{convert|250|ft|m}}.<ref name=\"Dow12\" />\n\nThe three-storey building was dominated by a {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} [[clock tower]] topped with a [[cupola]] and [[weather vane]]. At the north end of the building, access could be gained to the parcels office via two large metal gates. Once inside the building on the ground floor level, one reached the large and lofty booking hall. It was over {{convert|100|ft|m}} long and {{convert|66|ft|m}} wide, and contained the best-quality pine and a hard-wearing oak floor, along with a gallery on each side to gain access to spacious offices on the first floor. The booking hall contained seven ticket-issuing windows, three each for the Great Central and Great Northern and one for excursion traffic; a clock-type train indicator served all platforms. An iron overbridge led from the booking hall and spanned the platforms, to which it was connected by four broad staircases. A small footbridge at the end provided access to the [[island platform]]s at the south end, themselves connected to a side exit leading onto Parliament Street.<ref name=\"Dow12\"/>\n[[File:Nottingham Victoria railway station 2058984 d4d6fe34.jpg|thumb|right|The station in 1959]]\n\nThe station itself comprised two large island platforms, each between {{convert|1250|ft|m}} and {{convert|1270|ft|m}} long, with two bays at each end for local traffic, giving a total of 12 platform faces. On each island platform were dining and tea rooms together with kitchens, sleeping facilities for staff, waiting rooms, and lavatories. All these buildings were, like the rest of the station, lined with glazed tiles, which were generally buff in colour and embellished with a chocolate [[Dado (architecture)|dado]].  Large {{convert|42|ft|6|in|m}} steel pillars held up an enormous three-part glazed canopy measuring {{convert|450|ft|m}} in length, with a centre span of {{convert|83|ft|3|in|m}} and a pair of flanking spans each of {{convert|63|ft|9|in|m}}. There were additional glass roofs over the double-bay platforms, each carried on central pillars. An electrically lit subway system, below track level and covering the breadth of the station, could be used for transporting luggage, thereby avoiding the need to carry it over the footbridges. The subway was linked to the main station by four lifts serving respectively the booking hall, cloakroom, and two island platforms.
