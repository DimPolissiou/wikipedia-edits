His later works were more [[abstract art|abstract]]. His key influence related to bold use of colour and a clear love of experimentation with both depth and [[Lightness (color)|tone]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nRobert Delaunay was born in [[Paris]], the son of George Delaunay and [[Count]]ess Berthe F\u00e9licie de Rose. While he was a child, Delaunay's parents divorced, and he was raised by his mother's sister Marie and her husband Charles Damour, in La Ronch\u00e8re near [[Bourges]]. When he failed his final exam and said he wanted to become a painter, his uncle in 1902 sent him to Ronsin's [[atelier]] to study [[Decorative Arts]] in the [[Belleville, Paris|Belleville]] district of Paris.<ref>[[#hd95|D\u00fcchting]]: p7</ref> At age 19, he left Ronsin to focus entirely on painting and contributed six works to the [[Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants]] in 1904.<ref name=kh>Robert Delaunay \u2013 Sonia Delaunay, 1999, {{ISBN|3-7701-5216-6}}</ref>\n\nHe traveled to [[Brittany]], where he was influenced by the [[Pont-Aven School|group of Pont-Aven]]; and, in 1906, he contributed works he painted in Brittany to the 22nd Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants, where he met [[Henri Rousseau]].<ref name=kh/>\n\nDelaunay formed a close friendship at this time with [[Jean Metzinger]], with whom he shared an [[Art exhibition|exhibition]] at a [[Art gallery|gallery]] run by Berthe Weill early in 1907. The two of them were singled out by the [[art critic]] [[Louis Vauxcelles]] in 1907 as [[Divisionism|Divisionists]] who used large, mosaic-like 'cubes' to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.all-art.org/art_20th_century/metzinger1.html|title=History of Art: Jean Metzinger|website=www.all-art.org}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Robert Delaunay, c.1906, Paysage au disque solaire, oil on canvas, 54 x 46 cm, Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne.jpg|thumb|Robert Delaunay, ''Paysage au disque'', 1906\u201307, oil on canvas, 55 x 46 cm, Mus\u00e9e national d'art moderne (MNAM), Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris]]\nRobert Herbert writes: \"Metzinger's [[Neo-Impressionist]] period was somewhat longer than that of his close friend Delaunay...

[[Piet Mondrian]] developed a similar mosaic-like Divisionist technique circa 1909.

From 1912 to 1914, he painted nonfigurative paintings based on the optical characteristics of brilliant colors that were so dynamic they would function as the form. His theories are mostly concerned with color and light and influenced many, including [[Stanton Macdonald-Wright]], [[Morgan Russell]], [[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[Der Blaue Reiter]], [[August Macke]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Paul Klee]], and [[Lyonel Feininger]]. [[Apollinaire]] was strongly influenced by Delaunay's theories of color and often quoted from them to explain Orphism. Delaunay's fixations with color as the expressive and structural means were sustained by his study of color.\n\nHis writings on color, which were influenced by scientists and theoreticians, are intuitive and can sometimes be random statements based on the belief that color is a thing in itself, with its own powers of expression and form. He believes painting is a purely visual art that depends on intellectual elements, and perception is in the impact of colored light on the eye. The contrasts and harmonies of color produce in the eye simultaneous movements and correspond to movement in nature. Vision becomes the subject of painting.\n\nHis early paintings are deeply rooted in [[Neoimpressionism]]. ''Night Scene'', for example, has vigorous activity, with the use of lively brushstrokes in bright colors against a dark background, not defining solid objects but the areas that surround them.\n\nThe spectral colors of Neoimpressionism were later abandoned. The ''Eiffel Tower'' series represented the fragmentation of solid objects and their merging with space. Influences in this series were C\u00e9zanne, Analytical Cubism, and Futurism. In the ''Eiffel Tower'' the interpenetration of tangible objects and surrounding space is accompanied by the intense movement of geometric planes that are more dynamic than the static equilibrium of Cubist forms.\n\nIn 1908, after a term in the military working as a regimental librarian, he met [[Sonia Terk]]; at the time she was married to a German art dealer whom she would soon divorce. In 1909, Delaunay began to paint a series of studies of the city of Paris and the [[Eiffel Tower]], the [[Eiffel Tower (Delaunay series)|''Eiffel Tower'' series]].\n\nThe following year, he married Terk, and the couple settled in a studio apartment in Paris, where their son [[Charles Delaunay|Charles]] was born in January 1911. The same year, at the invitation of [[Wassily Kandinsky]], Delaunay joined The Blue Rider ([[Der Blaue Reiter]]), a [[Munich]]-based group of artists. Delaunay was also successful in Germany, Switzerland, and Russia. He participated in the first Blanc Reiter exhibition in Munich and sold four works. Delaunay's paintings encouraged an enthusiastic response with Blaue Reiter. The Blaue Reiter connections led to Erwin Ritter von Busse's article \"Robert Delaunay\u2019s Methods of Compositions\" which appeared in the 1912 ''Blaue Reiter Almanac''. Delaunay would go to exhibit in February of that year, in the second Blaue Reiter exhibition in Munich and Valet de Carrean in Moscow.\n\n[[Image:Robert Delaunay, 1913, Premier Disque, 134 cm, 52.7 inches, Private collection.jpg|thumb|200px|Robert Delaunay.

I made paintings that seemed like prisms compared to the Cubism my fellow artists were producing. I was the heretic of Cubism. I had great arguments with my comrades who banned color from their palette, depriving it of all elemental mobility.

On March 13 his first major exhibition in Paris closed after two weeks at the [[Galerie Barbazanges]]. The exhibition showed forty-six works from his early Impressionist works to his Cubist Eiffel Tower painting from 1909\u20131911.\nArt Critic Guillaume Apollinaire praised those works of the exhibition and proclaimed Delaunay as \"an artist who has a monumental vision of the world.\"\n\nIn the March 23, 1912, issue of ''L'Assiette au Beurre'', The first published suggestion that Delaunay had broken with this group of Cubists appeared, in James Burkley's review of that year's Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants. \nBurkley wrote, \"The Cubists, who occupy only a room, have multiplied. Their leaders, Picasso and Braque, have not participated in their grouping, and Delaunay, commonly labeled a Cubist, has wished to isolate himself and declare that he has nothing in common with Metzinger or Le Fauconnier.\"\n\nWith [[Apollinaire]], Delaunay traveled to [[Berlin]] in January 1913 for an exhibition of his work at [[Der Sturm|Galerie Der Sturm]]. On their way back to Paris, the two stayed with [[August Macke]] in [[Bonn]], where Macke introduced them to [[Max Ernst]].<ref name=wb>Willard Bohn: Apollinaire and the international avant-garde (1997), {{ISBN|0-7914-3195-9}}, p82</ref> When his painting ''La ville de Paris'' was rejected by the [[Armory Show]] as being too big<ref>''La ville de Paris'' measures 234 x 294 cm.</ref> he instructed [[Samuel Halpert]] to remove all his works from the show.<ref name=kh/>\n\n===Spanish and Portuguese years (1914\u20131920)===\nAt the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1914 Sonia and Robert were staying in [[Fontarabie]] in Spain.

Suffering from [[cancer]], Delaunay was unable to endure being moved around, and his health deteriorated. He died from cancer on 25 October 1941 in [[Montpellier]] at the age of 56.

The two of them were singled out by the [[art critic]] [[Louis Vauxcelles]] in 1907 as [[Divisionism|Divisionists]] who used large, mosaic-like 'cubes' to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.all-art.org/art_20th_century/metzinger1.html|title=History of Art: Jean Metzinger|website=www.all-art.org}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Robert Delaunay, c.1906, Paysage au disque solaire, oil on canvas, 54 x 46 cm, Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne.jpg|thumb|Robert Delaunay, ''Paysage au disque'', 1906\u201307, oil on canvas, 55 x 46 cm, Mus\u00e9e national d'art moderne (MNAM), Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris]]\nRobert Herbert writes: \"Metzinger's [[Neo-Impressionist]] period was somewhat longer than that of his close friend Delaunay...

From 1912 to 1914, he painted nonfigurative paintings based on the optical characteristics of brilliant colors that were so dynamic they would function as the form. His theories are mostly concerned with color and light and influenced many, including [[Stanton Macdonald-Wright]], [[Morgan Russell]], [[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[Der Blaue Reiter]], [[August Macke]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Paul Klee]], and [[Lyonel Feininger]]. [[Apollinaire]] was strongly influenced by Delaunay's theories of color and often quoted from them to explain Orphism. Delaunay's fixations with color as the expressive and structural means were sustained by his study of color.\n\nHis writings on color, which were influenced by scientists and theoreticians, are intuitive and can sometimes be random statements based on the belief that color is a thing in itself, with its own powers of expression and form. He believes painting is a purely visual art that depends on intellectual elements, and perception is in the impact of colored light on the eye. The contrasts and harmonies of color produce in the eye simultaneous movements and correspond to movement in nature. Vision becomes the subject of painting.\n\nHis early paintings are deeply rooted in [[Neoimpressionism]]. ''Night Scene'', for example, has vigorous activity, with the use of lively brushstrokes in bright colors against a dark background, not defining solid objects but the areas that surround them.\n\nThe spectral colors of Neoimpressionism were later abandoned. The ''Eiffel Tower'' series represented the fragmentation of solid objects and their merging with space. Influences in this series were C\u00e9zanne, Analytical Cubism, and Futurism. In the ''Eiffel Tower'' the interpenetration of tangible objects and surrounding space is accompanied by the intense movement of geometric planes that are more dynamic than the static equilibrium of Cubist forms.\n\nIn 1908, after a term in the military working as a regimental librarian, he met [[Sonia Terk]]; at the time she was married to a German art dealer whom she would soon divorce. In 1909, Delaunay began to paint a series of studies of the city of Paris and the [[Eiffel Tower]], the [[Eiffel Tower (Delaunay series)|''Eiffel Tower'' series]].\n\nThe following year, he married Terk, and the couple settled in a studio apartment in Paris, where their son [[Charles Delaunay|Charles]] was born in January 1911. The same year, at the invitation of [[Wassily Kandinsky]], Delaunay joined The Blue Rider ([[Der Blaue Reiter]]), a [[Munich]]-based group of artists. Delaunay was also successful in Germany, Switzerland, and Russia. He participated in the first Blanc Reiter exhibition in Munich and sold four works. Delaunay's paintings encouraged an enthusiastic response with Blaue Reiter. The Blaue Reiter connections led to Erwin Ritter von Busse's article \"Robert Delaunay\u2019s Methods of Compositions\" which appeared in the 1912 ''Blaue Reiter Almanac''. Delaunay would go to exhibit in February of that year, in the second Blaue Reiter exhibition in Munich and Valet de Carrean in Moscow.\n\n[[Image:Robert Delaunay, 1913, Premier Disque, 134 cm, 52.7 inches, Private collection.jpg|thumb|200px|Robert Delaunay.

I made paintings that seemed like prisms compared to the Cubism my fellow artists were producing. I was the heretic of Cubism.

On March 13 his first major exhibition in Paris closed after two weeks at the [[Galerie Barbazanges]]. The exhibition showed forty-six works from his early Impressionist works to his Cubist Eiffel Tower painting from 1909\u20131911.\nArt Critic Guillaume Apollinaire praised those works of the exhibition and proclaimed Delaunay as \"an artist who has a monumental vision of the world.\"\n\nIn the March 23, 1912, issue of ''L'Assiette au Beurre'', The first published suggestion that Delaunay had broken with this group of Cubists appeared, in James Burkley's review of that year's Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants. \nBurkley wrote, \"The Cubists, who occupy only a room, have multiplied. Their leaders, Picasso and Braque, have not participated in their grouping, and Delaunay, commonly labeled a Cubist, has wished to isolate himself and declare that he has nothing in common with Metzinger or Le Fauconnier.\"\n\nWith [[Apollinaire]], Delaunay traveled to [[Berlin]] in January 1913 for an exhibition of his work at [[Der Sturm|Galerie Der Sturm]]. On their way back to Paris, the two stayed with [[August Macke]] in [[Bonn]], where Macke introduced them to [[Max Ernst]].<ref name=wb>Willard Bohn: Apollinaire and the international avant-garde (1997), {{ISBN|0-7914-3195-9}}, p82</ref> When his painting ''La ville de Paris'' was rejected by the [[Armory Show]] as being too big<ref>''La ville de Paris'' measures 234X294cm.</ref> he instructed [[Samuel Halpert]] to remove all his works from the show.<ref name=kh/>\n\n===Spanish and Portuguese years (1914\u20131920)===\nAt the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1914 Sonia and Robert were staying in [[Fontarabie]] in Spain.
