{"title_page": "Low-pass filter", "text_new": "A '''low-pass filter''' ('''LPF''') is a [[Filter (signal processing)|filter]] that passes [[signal (electrical engineering)|signals]] with a [[frequency]] lower than a selected [[cutoff frequency]] and [[attenuate]]s signals with frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency. The exact [[frequency response]] of the filter depends on the [[filter design]]. The filter is sometimes called a '''high-cut filter''', or '''treble-cut filter''' in audio applications. A low-pass filter is the complement of a [[high-pass filter]].\n\nIn optics, '''high-pass''' and '''low-pass''' may have the different meanings, depending on whether referring to frequency or wavelength of light, since these variable are inversely related. High-pass frequency filters would act as low-pass wavelength filters, and vice versa.  For this reason it is a good practice to refer to wavelength filters as \"Short-pass\" and \"Long-pass\" to avoid confusion, which would correspond to \"high-pass\" and \"low-pass\" frequencies. {{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nLow-pass filters exist in many different forms, including electronic circuits such as a '''hiss filter''' used in [[Sound recording|audio]], [[anti-aliasing filter]]s for conditioning signals prior to [[analog-to-digital conversion]], [[digital filter]]s for smoothing sets of data, acoustic barriers, [[Gaussian blur|blurring]] of images, and so on. The [[moving average (finance)|moving average]] operation used in fields such as finance is a particular kind of low-pass filter, and can be analyzed with the same [[signal processing]] techniques as are used for other low-pass filters.  Low-pass filters provide a smoother form of a signal, removing the short-term fluctuations and leaving the longer-term trend.\n\nFilter designers will often use the low-pass form as a [[prototype filter]].  That is, a filter with unity bandwidth and impedance.  The desired filter is obtained from the prototype by scaling for the desired bandwidth and impedance and transforming into the desired bandform (that is low-pass, high-pass, [[band-pass filter|band-pass]] or [[band-stop filter|band-stop]]).\n\n==Examples==\nExamples of low-pass filters occur in acoustics, optics and electronics.\n\nA stiff physical barrier tends to reflect higher sound frequencies, and so acts as an acoustic low-pass filter for transmitting sound. When music is playing in another room, the low notes are easily heard, while the high notes are attenuated.\n\nAn [[optical filter]] with the same function can correctly be called a low-pass filter, but conventionally is called a ''longpass'' filter (low frequency is long wavelength), to avoid confusion.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.globalspec.com/learnmore/optics_optical_components/optical_components/long_short_pass_filters |title=Long Pass Filters and Short Pass Filters Information |access-date=2017-10-04}}</ref>\n\nIn an electronic low-pass [[RC filter]] for voltage signals, high frequencies in the input signal are attenuated, but the filter has little attenuation below the [[cutoff frequency]] determined by its [[RC time constant]]. For current signals, a similar circuit, using a resistor and capacitor in [[Parallel circuits#Parallel circuits|parallel]], works in a similar manner.  (See [[current divider]] discussed in more detail [[#Electronic low-pass filters|below]].)\n\nElectronic low-pass filters are used on inputs to [[subwoofer]]s and other types of [[loudspeaker]]s, to block high pitches that they can't efficiently reproduce. Radio transmitters use low-pass filters to block [[harmonic]] emissions that might interfere with other communications. The tone knob on many [[electric guitar]]s is a low-pass filter used to reduce the amount of treble in the sound. An [[integrator]] is another [[Time constant#Time constants in electrical circuits|time constant]] low-pass filter.<ref>{{cite book |title       = Microelectronic Circuits, 3 ed.\n |page        = [https://archive.org/details/microelectronicc00sedr_0/page/60 60]\n |first1      = Adel\n |last1       = Sedra\n |authorlink1 = Adel Sedra\n |first2      = Kenneth C.\n |last2       = Smith\n |publisher   = Saunders College Publishing\n |year        = 1991\n |isbn        = 0-03-051648-X\n |url-access  = registration\n |url         = https://archive.org/details/microelectronicc00sedr_0/page/60\n}}</ref>\n\nTelephone lines fitted with [[DSL splitter]]s use low-pass and [[high-pass filter|high-pass]] filters to separate [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]] and [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] signals sharing the same [[twisted pair|pair]] of wires.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epanorama.net/documents/telecom/adsl_filter.html |title=ADSL filters explained |publisher=Epanorama.net |accessdate=2013-09-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcweenie.com/hni/broadband/broad6.shtml |title=Home Networking \u2013 Local Area Network |publisher=Pcweenie.com |date=2009-04-12 |accessdate=2013-09-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927135123/http://www.pcweenie.com/hni/broadband/broad6.shtml |archive-date=2013-09-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nLow-pass filters also play a significant role in the sculpting of sound created by analogue and virtual analogue [[synthesiser]]s. ''See [[subtractive synthesis]].''\n\nA low-pass filter is used as an [[anti-aliasing filter]] prior to [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]] and for [[Reconstruction filter|reconstruction]] in [[digital-to-analog conversion]].\n\n==Ideal and real filters==\n[[File:Sinc function (normalized).svg|thumb|The [[sinc function]], the time-domain [[impulse response]] of an ideal low-pass filter.]]\n[[File:Butterworth response.svg|thumb|350px|The gain-magnitude frequency response of a first-order (one-pole) low-pass filter. ''Power gain'' is shown in decibels (i.e., a 3 [[Decibel|dB]] decline reflects an additional half-power attenuation). [[Angular frequency]] is shown on a logarithmic scale in units of radians per second.]]\nAn [[sinc filter|ideal low-pass filter]] completely eliminates all frequencies above the [[cutoff frequency]] while passing those below unchanged; its [[frequency response]] is a [[rectangular function]] and is a [[brick-wall filter]].  The transition region present in practical filters does not exist in an ideal filter.  An ideal low-pass filter can be realized mathematically (theoretically) by multiplying a signal by the rectangular function in the frequency domain or, equivalently, [[convolution]] with its [[impulse response]], a [[sinc function]], in the time domain.\n\nHowever, the ideal filter is impossible to realize without also having signals of infinite extent in time, and so generally needs to be approximated for real ongoing signals, because the sinc function's support region extends to all past and future times.  The filter would therefore need to have infinite delay, or knowledge of the infinite future and past, in order to perform the convolution.  It is effectively realizable for pre-recorded digital signals by assuming extensions of zero into the past and future, or more typically by making the signal repetitive and using Fourier analysis.\n\nReal filters for [[Real-time computing|real-time]] applications approximate the ideal filter by truncating and [[window function|windowing]] the infinite impulse response to make a [[finite impulse response]]; applying that filter requires delaying the signal for a moderate period of time, allowing the computation to \"see\" a little bit into the future.  This delay is manifested as [[Phase (waves)|phase shift]].  Greater accuracy in approximation requires a longer delay.\n\nAn ideal low-pass filter results in [[ringing artifacts]] via the [[Gibbs phenomenon]]. These can be reduced or worsened by choice of windowing function, and the [[Window function#Filter design|design and choice of real filters]] involves understanding and minimizing these artifacts. For example, \"simple truncation [of sinc] causes severe ringing artifacts,\" in signal reconstruction, and to reduce these artifacts one uses window functions \"which drop off more smoothly at the edges.\"<ref>[http://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/vis/vismed/Windows/MasteringWindows.pdf Mastering Windows: Improving Reconstruction]</ref>\n\nThe [[Whittaker\u2013Shannon interpolation formula]] describes how to use a perfect low-pass filter to reconstruct a [[continuous signal]] from a sampled [[Digital signal (signal processing)|digital signal]].  Real [[digital-to-analog converter]]s use real filter approximations.\n\n==Discrete-time realization==\n{{For|another method of conversion from continuous- to discrete-time|Bilinear transform}}\n\nMany [[digital filter]]s are designed to give low-pass characteristics. Both [[infinite impulse response]] and [[finite impulse response]] low pass filters as well as filters using [[Fourier transform]]s are widely used.\n\n===Simple infinite impulse response filter===\n\nThe effect of an infinite impulse response low-pass filter can be simulated on a computer by analyzing an RC filter's behavior in the time domain, and then [[discrete signal|discretizing]] the model.\n\n[[File:1st Order Lowpass Filter RC.svg|right|framed|A simple low-pass [[RC circuit|RC filter]]]]\nFrom the circuit diagram to the right, according to [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's Laws]] and the definition of [[capacitance]]:\n{{NumBlk|::|<math>v_{\\text{in}}(t) - v_{\\text{out}}(t) = R \\; i(t)</math>|{{EquationRef|V}}}}\n{{NumBlk|::|<math>Q_c(t) = C \\, v_{\\text{out}}(t)</math>|{{EquationRef|Q}}}}\n{{NumBlk|::|<math>i(t) = \\frac{\\operatorname{d} Q_c}{\\operatorname{d} t}</math>|{{EquationRef|I}}}}\n\nwhere <math>Q_c(t)</math> is the charge stored in the capacitor at time <math>\\scriptstyle t</math>. Substituting equation {{EquationNote|Q}} into equation {{EquationNote|I}} gives <math>\\scriptstyle i(t) \\;=\\; C \\frac{\\operatorname{d}v_{\\text{out}}}{\\operatorname{d}t}</math>, which can be substituted into equation {{EquationNote|V}} so that:\n\n:<math>v_{\\text{in}}(t) - v_{\\text{out}}(t) = RC \\frac{\\operatorname{d}v_{\\text{out}}}{\\operatorname{d}t}</math>\n\nThis equation can be discretized. For simplicity, assume that samples of the input and output are taken at evenly spaced points in time separated by <math>\\scriptstyle \\Delta_T</math> time. Let the samples of <math>\\scriptstyle v_{\\text{in}}</math> be represented by the sequence <math>\\scriptstyle (x_1,\\, x_2,\\, \\ldots,\\, x_n)</math>, and let <math>\\scriptstyle v_{\\text{out}}</math> be represented by the sequence <math>\\scriptstyle (y_1,\\, y_2,\\, \\ldots,\\, y_n)</math>, which correspond to the same points in time.    <!--\n\n:Replace <math>V_{\\text{in}(t)</math> with <math>x_i</math>\n:Replace <math>V_{\\text{out}}(t)</math> with <math>y_i</math>\n:Replace <math>\\operatorname{d}V_{\\text{out}}</math> with <math>y_{i} - y_{i-1}</math>\n:Replace <math>\\operatorname{d}t</math> with <math>\\Delta_T</math>\n\n--> Making these substitutions:\n\n:<math>x_i - y_i = RC \\, \\frac{y_{i}-y_{i-1}}{\\Delta_T}</math>\n\nAnd rearranging terms gives the [[recurrence relation]]\n\n:<math>y_i = \\overbrace{x_i \\left( \\frac{\\Delta_T}{RC + \\Delta_T} \\right)}^{\\text{Input contribution}} + \\overbrace{y_{i-1} \\left( \\frac{RC}{RC + \\Delta_T} \\right)}^{\\text{Inertia from previous output}}.</math>\n\nThat is, this discrete-time implementation of a simple RC low-pass filter is the [[Exponential smoothing|exponentially weighted moving average]] \n\n:<math>y_i = \\alpha x_i + (1 - \\alpha) y_{i-1} \\qquad \\text{where} \\qquad \\alpha := \\frac{\\Delta_T}{RC + \\Delta_T} </math>\n\nBy definition, the ''smoothing factor'' <math>\\scriptstyle 0 \\;\\leq\\; \\alpha \\;\\leq\\; 1</math>.

If <math>\\alpha \\;\\ll\\; 0.5</math>, then <math>RC</math> is significantly larger than the sampling interval, and <math>\\Delta_T \\;\\approx\\; \\alpha RC</math>.\n\nThe filter recurrence relation provides a way to determine the output samples in terms of the input samples and the preceding output.  The following [[pseudocode]] algorithm simulates the effect of a low-pass filter on a series of digital samples:\n\n // Return RC low-pass filter output samples, given input samples,\n // time interval ''dt'', and time constant ''RC''\n '''function''' lowpass(''real[0..n]'' x, ''real'' dt, ''real'' RC)\n     '''var''' ''real[0..n]'' y\n     '''var''' ''real'' \u03b1 := dt / (RC + dt)\n     y[0] := \u03b1 * x[0]\n     '''for''' i '''from''' 1 '''to''' n\n         y[i] := \u03b1 * x[i] + (1-\u03b1) * y[i-1]\n     '''return''' y\n\nThe [[programming loop|loop]] that calculates each of the ''n'' outputs can be [[code refactoring|refactored]] into the equivalent:\n\n     '''for''' i '''from''' 1 '''to''' n\n         y[i] := y[i-1] + \u03b1 * (x[i] - y[i-1])\n\nThat is, the change from one filter output to the next is [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the difference between the previous output and the next input. This [[exponential smoothing]] property matches the [[exponential function|exponential]] decay seen in the continuous-time system. As expected, as the [[time constant]] <math>\\scriptstyle RC</math> increases, the discrete-time smoothing parameter <math>\\scriptstyle \\alpha</math> decreases, and the output samples <math>\\scriptstyle (y_1,\\, y_2,\\, \\ldots,\\, y_n)</math> respond more slowly to a change in the input samples <math>\\scriptstyle (x_1,\\, x_2,\\, \\ldots,\\, x_n)</math>; the system has more ''[[inertia]]''.  This filter is an [[infinite-impulse-response]] (IIR) single-pole low-pass filter.\n\n===Finite impulse response===\nFinite-impulse-response filters can be built that approximate to the [[sinc function]] time-domain response of an ideal sharp-cutoff low-pass filter. For minimum distortion the finite impulse response filter has an unbounded number of coefficients operating on an unbounded signal. In practice, the time-domain response must be time truncated and is often of a simplified shape; in the simplest case, a [[running average]] can be used, giving a square time response.<ref>Whilmshurst, T H (1990) ''Signal recovery from noise in electronic instrumentation.'' {{ISBN|9780750300582}} </ref>\n\n===Fourier transform===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}\n\nFor non-realtime filtering, to achieve a low pass filter, the entire signal is usually taken as a looped signal, the Fourier transform is taken, filtered in the frequency domain, followed by an inverse Fourier transform. Only O(n log(n)) operations are required compared to O(n<sup>2</sup>) for the time domain filtering algorithm.\n\nThis can also sometimes be done in real-time, where the signal is delayed long enough to perform the Fourier transformation on shorter, overlapping blocks.\n\n==Continuous-time realization==\n[[File:Butterworth Filter Orders.svg|thumb|350px|Plot of the gain of Butterworth low-pass filters of orders 1 through 5, with [[cutoff frequency]] <math>\\omega_0 = 1</math>. Note that the slope is 20''n'' dB/decade where ''n'' is the filter order.]]\n\nThere are many different types of filter circuits, with different responses to changing frequency.  The frequency response of a filter is generally represented using a [[Bode plot]], and the filter is characterized by its [[cutoff frequency]] and rate of frequency [[roll-off|rolloff]]. In all cases, at the ''cutoff frequency,'' the filter [[attenuate]]s the input power by half or 3&nbsp;dB. So the '''order''' of the filter determines the amount of additional attenuation for frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency.\n\n* A '''first-order filter''', for example, reduces the signal amplitude by half (so power reduces by a factor of 4, or {{nowrap|6 dB)}}, every time the frequency doubles (goes up one [[octave]]); more precisely, the power rolloff approaches 20&nbsp;dB per [[Decade (log scale)|decade]] in the limit of high frequency. The magnitude Bode plot for a first-order filter looks like a horizontal line below the [[cutoff frequency]], and a diagonal line above the cutoff frequency.  There is also a \"knee curve\" at the boundary between the two, which smoothly transitions between the two straight line regions.  If the [[transfer function]] of a first-order low-pass filter has a [[zero (complex analysis)|zero]] as well as a [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]], the Bode plot flattens out again, at some maximum attenuation of high frequencies; such an effect is caused for example by a little bit of the input leaking around the one-pole filter; this one-pole\u2013one-zero filter is still a first-order low-pass. ''See [[Pole\u2013zero plot]] and [[RC circuit]].''\n* A '''second-order filter''' attenuates high frequencies more steeply. The Bode plot for this type of filter resembles that of a first-order filter, except that it falls off more quickly. For example, a second-order [[Butterworth filter]] reduces the signal amplitude to one fourth its original level every time the frequency doubles (so power decreases by 12&nbsp;dB per octave, or 40&nbsp;dB per decade). Other all-pole second-order filters may roll off at different rates initially depending on their [[Q factor]], but approach the same final rate of 12&nbsp;dB per octave; as with the first-order filters, zeroes in the transfer function can change the high-frequency asymptote. See [[RLC circuit]].\n* Third- and higher-order filters are defined similarly.  In general, the final rate of power rolloff for an order-<math>\\scriptstyle n</math> all-pole filter is <math>\\scriptstyle 6n</math> dB per octave (i.e., <math>\\scriptstyle 20n</math> dB per decade).\n\nOn any Butterworth filter, if one extends the horizontal line to the right and the diagonal line to the upper-left (the [[asymptote]]s of the function), they intersect at exactly the ''cutoff frequency''.  The frequency response at the cutoff frequency in a first-order filter is 3&nbsp;dB below the horizontal line.  The various types of filters ([[Butterworth filter]], [[Chebyshev filter]], [[Bessel filter]], etc.) all have different-looking ''knee curves''.  Many second-order filters have \"peaking\" or [[Electrical resonance|resonance]] that puts their frequency response at the cutoff frequency ''above'' the horizontal line. Furthermore, the actual frequency where this peaking occurs can be predicted without calculus, as shown by Cartwright<ref>K. V. Cartwright, P. Russell and E. J. Kaminsky,\"[http://www.lajpe.org/dec2012/8_LAJPE_703_Kenneth_Cartwright_preprint_corr_f.pdf Finding the maximum magnitude response (gain) of second-order filters without calculus],\" Lat. Am. J. Phys. Educ. Vol. 6, No. 4, pp. 559-565, 2012.</ref> et al. For third-order filters, the peaking and its frequency of occurrence can also be predicted without calculus as shown by Cartwright<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cartwright|first=K. V. |author2=P. Russell |author3=E. J. Kaminsky|title=Finding the maximum and minimum magnitude responses (gains) of third-order filters without calculus|journal=Lat. Am. J. Phys.

''See [[electronic filter]] for other types.''\n\nThe meanings of 'low' and 'high'\u2014that is, the [[cutoff frequency]]\u2014depend on the characteristics of the filter. The term \"low-pass filter\" merely refers to the shape of the filter's response; a high-pass filter could be built that cuts off at a lower frequency than any low-pass filter\u2014it is their responses that set them apart.  Electronic circuits can be devised for any desired frequency range, right up through microwave frequencies (above 1&nbsp;GHz) and higher.\n\n===Laplace notation===\nContinuous-time filters can also be described in terms of the [[Laplace transform]] of their [[impulse response]], in a way that lets all characteristics of the filter be easily analyzed by considering the pattern of poles and zeros of the Laplace transform in the complex plane. (In discrete time, one can similarly consider the [[Z-transform]] of the impulse response.)\n\nFor example, a first-order low-pass filter can be described in Laplace notation as:\n:<math>\n\\frac{\\text{Output}}{\\text{Input}} = K \\frac{1}{\\tau s + 1}\n</math>\n\nwhere ''s'' is the Laplace transform variable, ''\u03c4'' is the filter [[time constant]], and ''K'' is the [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] of the filter in the [[passband]].\n\n== Electronic low-pass filters ==\n\n===First order===\n\n==== RC filter ====\n[[File:RC Divider.svg|thumb|200px|Passive, first order low-pass RC filter]]\n\nOne simple low-pass filter [[electrical circuit|circuit]] consists of a [[resistor]] in series with a [[External electric load|load]], and a [[capacitor]] in parallel with the load. The capacitor exhibits [[Reactance (electronics)|reactance]], and blocks low-frequency signals, forcing them through the load instead. At higher frequencies the reactance drops, and the capacitor effectively functions as a short circuit. The combination of resistance and capacitance gives the [[time constant]] of the filter <math>\\scriptstyle \\tau \\;=\\; RC </math> (represented by the Greek letter [[tau]]). The break frequency, also called the turnover frequency, corner frequency, or [[cutoff frequency]] (in hertz), is determined by the time constant:\n\n:<math>\nf_\\mathrm{c} = {1 \\over 2 \\pi \\tau } = {1 \\over 2 \\pi R C}\n</math>\n\nor equivalently (in [[radian]]s per second):\n\n:<math>\n\\omega_\\mathrm{c} = {1 \\over \\tau} = {1 \\over R C}\n</math>\n\nThis circuit may be understood by considering the time the capacitor needs to charge or discharge through the resistor:\n* At low frequencies, there is plenty of time for the capacitor to charge up to practically the same voltage as the input voltage.\n* At high frequencies, the capacitor only has time to charge up a small amount before the input switches direction. The output goes up and down only a small fraction of the amount the input goes up and down. At double the frequency, there's only time for it to charge up half the amount.\n\nAnother way to understand this circuit is through the concept of [[Reactance (electronics)|reactance]] at a particular frequency:\n* Since [[direct current]] (DC) cannot flow through the capacitor, DC input must flow out the path marked <math>\\scriptstyle V_\\mathrm{out}</math> (analogous to removing the capacitor).\n* Since [[alternating current]] (AC) flows very well through the capacitor, almost as well as it flows through solid wire, AC input flows out through the capacitor, effectively [[short circuit]]ing to ground (analogous to replacing the capacitor with just a wire).\n\nThe capacitor is not an \"on/off\" object (like the block or pass fluidic explanation above).  The capacitor variably acts between these two extremes.  It is the [[Bode plot]] and [[frequency response]] that show this variability.\n\n==== RL filter====\nA resistor\u2013inductor circuit or [[RL filter]] is an [[electric circuit]] composed of [[resistors]] and [[inductors]] driven by a [[voltage source|voltage]] or [[current source]]. A first order RL circuit is composed of one resistor and one inductor and is the simplest type of RL circuit.\n\nA first order RL circuit is one of the simplest [[analog filter|analogue]] [[infinite impulse response]] [[electronic filter]]s. It consists of a [[resistor]] and an [[inductor]], either in [[series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|series]] driven by a [[voltage source]] or in [[series and parallel circuits#Parallel circuits|parallel]] driven by a current source.\n\n=== Second order ===\n\n====RLC filter====\n[[File:RLC_low-pass.svg|thumb|RLC circuit as a low-pass filter]]\nAn [[RLC circuit]]  (the letters R, L and C can be in other orders) is an [[electrical circuit]] consisting of a [[resistor]], an [[inductor]], and a [[capacitor]], connected in series or in parallel.  The RLC part of the name is due to those letters being the usual electrical symbols for [[electrical resistance|resistance]], [[inductance]] and [[capacitance]] respectively.  The circuit forms a [[harmonic oscillator]] for current and will [[resonance|resonate]] in a similar way as an [[LC circuit]] will.  The main difference that the presence of the resistor makes is that any oscillation induced in the circuit will die away over time if it is not kept going by a source.  This effect of the resistor is called [[damping]]. The presence of the resistance also reduces the peak resonant frequency somewhat.  Some resistance is unavoidable in real circuits, even if a resistor is not specifically included as a component.  An ideal, pure LC circuit is an abstraction for the purpose of theory.\n\nThere are many applications for this circuit.  They are used in many different types of [[electronic oscillator|oscillator circuit]]s.  Another important application is for [[tuner (electronics)|tuning]], such as in [[receiver (radio)|radio receivers]] or [[television set]]s, where they are used to select a narrow range of frequencies from the ambient radio waves.  In this role the circuit is often referred to as a tuned circuit.  An RLC circuit can be used as a [[band-pass filter]], [[band-stop filter]], low-pass filter or [[high-pass filter]]. The RLC filter is described as a ''second-order'' circuit, meaning that any voltage or current in the circuit can be described by a second-order [[differential equation]] in circuit analysis.\n\n=== Higher order passive filters ===\nHigher order passive filters can also be constructed (see diagram for a third order example).\n[[File:LowPass3poleICauer.svg|300px|centre|thumb|A third-order low-pass filter ([[Cauer topology]]).

The exact [[frequency response]] of the filter depends on the [[filter design]]. The filter is sometimes called a '''high-cut filter''', or '''treble-cut filter''' in audio applications. A low-pass filter is the complement of a [[high-pass filter]].\n\nIn optics, '''high-pass''' and '''low-pass''' may have the different meanings, depending on whether referring to frequency or wavelength of light, since these variable are inversely related. High-pass frequency filters would act as low-pass wavelength filters, and vice versa.  For this reason it is a good practice to refer to wavelength filters as \"Short-pass\" and \"Long-pass\" to avoid confusion, which would correspond to \"high-pass\" and \"low-pass\" frequencies. {{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nLow-pass filters exist in many different forms, including electronic circuits such as a '''hiss filter''' used in [[Sound recording|audio]], [[anti-aliasing filter]]s for conditioning signals prior to [[analog-to-digital conversion]], [[digital filter]]s for smoothing sets of data, acoustic barriers, [[Gaussian blur|blurring]] of images, and so on. The [[moving average (finance)|moving average]] operation used in fields such as finance is a particular kind of low-pass filter, and can be analyzed with the same [[signal processing]] techniques as are used for other low-pass filters.  Low-pass filters provide a smoother form of a signal, removing the short-term fluctuations and leaving the longer-term trend.\n\nFilter designers will often use the low-pass form as a [[prototype filter]].  That is, a filter with unity bandwidth and impedance.  The desired filter is obtained from the prototype by scaling for the desired bandwidth and impedance and transforming into the desired bandform (that is low-pass, high-pass, [[band-pass filter|band-pass]] or [[band-stop filter|band-stop]]).\n\n==Examples==\nExamples of low-pass filters occur in acoustics, optics and electronics.\n\nA stiff physical barrier tends to reflect higher sound frequencies, and so acts as an acoustic low-pass filter for transmitting sound. When music is playing in another room, the low notes are easily heard, while the high notes are attenuated.\n\nAn [[optical filter]] with the same function can correctly be called a low-pass filter, but conventionally is called a ''longpass'' filter (low frequency is long wavelength), to avoid confusion.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.globalspec.com/learnmore/optics_optical_components/optical_components/long_short_pass_filters |title=Long Pass Filters and Short Pass Filters Information |access-date=2017-10-04}}</ref>\n\nIn an electronic low-pass [[RC filter]] for voltage signals, high frequencies in the input signal are attenuated, but the filter has little attenuation below the [[cutoff frequency]] determined by its [[RC time constant]]. For current signals, a similar circuit, using a resistor and capacitor in [[Parallel circuits#Parallel circuits|parallel]], works in a similar manner.  (See [[current divider]] discussed in more detail [[#Electronic low-pass filters|below]].)\n\nElectronic low-pass filters are used on inputs to [[subwoofer]]s and other types of [[loudspeaker]]s, to block high pitches that they can't efficiently reproduce. Radio transmitters use low-pass filters to block [[harmonic]] emissions that might interfere with other communications. The tone knob on many [[electric guitar]]s is a low-pass filter used to reduce the amount of treble in the sound. An [[integrator]] is another [[Time constant#Time constants in electrical circuits|time constant]] low-pass filter.<ref>{{cite book |title       = Microelectronic Circuits, 3 ed.\n |page        = [https://archive.org/details/microelectronicc00sedr_0/page/60 60]\n |first1      = Adel\n |last1       = Sedra\n |authorlink1 = Adel Sedra\n |first2      = Kenneth C.\n |last2       = Smith\n |publisher   = Saunders College Publishing\n |year        = 1991\n |isbn        = 0-03-051648-X\n |url-access  = registration\n |url         = https://archive.org/details/microelectronicc00sedr_0/page/60\n}}</ref>\n\nTelephone lines fitted with [[DSL splitter]]s use low-pass and [[high-pass filter|high-pass]] filters to separate [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]] and [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] signals sharing the same [[twisted pair|pair]] of wires.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epanorama.net/documents/telecom/adsl_filter.html |title=ADSL filters explained |publisher=Epanorama.net |accessdate=2013-09-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcweenie.com/hni/broadband/broad6.shtml |title=Home Networking \u2013 Local Area Network |publisher=Pcweenie.com |date=2009-04-12 |accessdate=2013-09-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927135123/http://www.pcweenie.com/hni/broadband/broad6.shtml |archive-date=2013-09-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nLow-pass filters also play a significant role in the sculpting of sound created by analogue and virtual analogue [[synthesiser]]s. ''See [[subtractive synthesis]].''\n\nA low-pass filter is used as an [[anti-aliasing filter]] prior to [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]] and for [[Reconstruction filter|reconstruction]] in [[digital-to-analog conversion]].\n\n==Ideal and real filters==\n[[File:Sinc function (normalized).svg|thumb|The [[sinc function]], the time-domain [[impulse response]] of an ideal low-pass filter.]]\n[[File:Butterworth response.svg|thumb|350px|The gain-magnitude frequency response of a first-order (one-pole) low-pass filter. ''Power gain'' is shown in decibels (i.e., a 3 [[Decibel|dB]] decline reflects an additional half-power attenuation). [[Angular frequency]] is shown on a logarithmic scale in units of radians per second.]]\nAn [[sinc filter|ideal low-pass filter]] completely eliminates all frequencies above the [[cutoff frequency]] while passing those below unchanged; its [[frequency response]] is a [[rectangular function]] and is a [[brick-wall filter]].  The transition region present in practical filters does not exist in an ideal filter.  An ideal low-pass filter can be realized mathematically (theoretically) by multiplying a signal by the rectangular function in the frequency domain or, equivalently, [[convolution]] with its [[impulse response]], a [[sinc function]], in the time domain.\n\nHowever, the ideal filter is impossible to realize without also having signals of infinite extent in time, and so generally needs to be approximated for real ongoing signals, because the sinc function's support region extends to all past and future times.  The filter would therefore need to have infinite delay, or knowledge of the infinite future and past, in order to perform the convolution.  It is effectively realizable for pre-recorded digital signals by assuming extensions of zero into the past and future, or more typically by making the signal repetitive and using Fourier analysis.\n\nReal filters for [[Real-time computing|real-time]] applications approximate the ideal filter by truncating and [[window function|windowing]] the infinite impulse response to make a [[finite impulse response]]; applying that filter requires delaying the signal for a moderate period of time, allowing the computation to \"see\" a little bit into the future.  This delay is manifested as [[Phase (waves)|phase shift]].  Greater accuracy in approximation requires a longer delay.\n\nAn ideal low-pass filter results in [[ringing artifacts]] via the [[Gibbs phenomenon]]. These can be reduced or worsened by choice of windowing function, and the [[Window function#Filter design|design and choice of real filters]] involves understanding and minimizing these artifacts. For example, \"simple truncation [of sinc] causes severe ringing artifacts,\" in signal reconstruction, and to reduce these artifacts one uses window functions \"which drop off more smoothly at the edges.\"<ref>[http://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/vis/vismed/Windows/MasteringWindows.pdf Mastering Windows: Improving Reconstruction]</ref>\n\nThe [[Whittaker\u2013Shannon interpolation formula]] describes how to use a perfect low-pass filter to reconstruct a [[continuous signal]] from a sampled [[Digital signal (signal processing)|digital signal]].  Real [[digital-to-analog converter]]s use real filter approximations.\n\n==Discrete-time realization==\n{{For|another method of conversion from continuous- to discrete-time|Bilinear transform}}\n\nMany [[digital filter]]s are designed to give low-pass characteristics. Both [[infinite impulse response]] and [[finite impulse response]] low pass filters as well as filters using [[Fourier transform]]s are widely used.\n\n===Simple infinite impulse response filter===\n\nThe effect of an infinite impulse response low-pass filter can be simulated on a computer by analyzing an RC filter's behavior in the time domain, and then [[discrete signal|discretizing]] the model.\n\n[[File:1st Order Lowpass Filter RC.svg|right|framed|A simple low-pass [[RC circuit|RC filter]]]]\nFrom the circuit diagram to the right, according to [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's Laws]] and the definition of [[capacitance]]:\n:{{NumBlk|:|<math>v_{\\text{in}}(t) - v_{\\text{out}}(t) = R \\; i(t)</math>|{{EquationRef|V}}}}\n:{{NumBlk|:|<math>Q_c(t) = C \\, v_{\\text{out}}(t)</math>|{{EquationRef|Q}}}}\n:{{NumBlk|:|<math>i(t) = \\frac{\\operatorname{d} Q_c}{\\operatorname{d} t}</math>|{{EquationRef|I}}}}\n\nwhere <math>Q_c(t)</math> is the charge stored in the capacitor at time <math>\\scriptstyle t</math>.

For simplicity, assume that samples of the input and output are taken at evenly spaced points in time separated by <math>\\scriptstyle \\Delta_T</math> time. Let the samples of <math>\\scriptstyle v_{\\text{in}}</math> be represented by the sequence <math>\\scriptstyle (x_1,\\, x_2,\\, \\ldots,\\, x_n)</math>, and let <math>\\scriptstyle v_{\\text{out}}</math> be represented by the sequence <math>\\scriptstyle (y_1,\\, y_2,\\, \\ldots,\\, y_n)</math>, which correspond to the same points in time.    <!--\n\n:Replace <math>V_{\\text{in}(t)</math> with <math>x_i</math>\n:Replace <math>V_{\\text{out}}(t)</math> with <math>y_i</math>\n:Replace <math>\\operatorname{d}V_{\\text{out}}</math> with <math>y_{i} - y_{i-1}</math>\n:Replace <math>\\operatorname{d}t</math> with <math>\\Delta_T</math>\n\n--> Making these substitutions:\n\n:<math>x_i - y_i = RC \\, \\frac{y_{i}-y_{i-1}}{\\Delta_T}</math>\n\nAnd rearranging terms gives the [[recurrence relation]]\n\n:<math>y_i = \\overbrace{x_i \\left( \\frac{\\Delta_T}{RC + \\Delta_T} \\right)}^{\\text{Input contribution}} + \\overbrace{y_{i-1} \\left( \\frac{RC}{RC + \\Delta_T} \\right)}^{\\text{Inertia from previous output}}.</math>\n\nThat is, this discrete-time implementation of a simple RC low-pass filter is the [[Exponential smoothing|exponentially weighted moving average]] \n\n:<math>y_i = \\alpha x_i + (1 - \\alpha) y_{i-1} \\qquad \\text{where} \\qquad \\alpha := \\frac{\\Delta_T}{RC + \\Delta_T} </math>\n\nBy definition, the ''smoothing factor'' <math>\\scriptstyle 0 \\;\\leq\\; \\alpha \\;\\leq\\; 1</math>.

If <math>\\alpha \\;\\ll\\; 0.5</math>, then <math>RC</math> is significantly larger than the sampling interval, and <math>\\Delta_T \\;\\approx\\; \\alpha RC</math>.\n\nThe filter recurrence relation provides a way to determine the output samples in terms of the input samples and the preceding output.  The following [[pseudocode]] algorithm simulates the effect of a low-pass filter on a series of digital samples:\n\n // Return RC low-pass filter output samples, given input samples,\n // time interval ''dt'', and time constant ''RC''\n '''function''' lowpass(''real[0..n]'' x, ''real'' dt, ''real'' RC)\n     '''var''' ''real[0..n]'' y\n     '''var''' ''real'' \u03b1 := dt / (RC + dt)\n     y[0] := \u03b1 * x[0]\n     '''for''' i '''from''' 1 '''to''' n\n         y[i] := \u03b1 * x[i] + (1-\u03b1) * y[i-1]\n     '''return''' y\n\nThe [[programming loop|loop]] that calculates each of the ''n'' outputs can be [[code refactoring|refactored]] into the equivalent:\n\n     '''for''' i '''from''' 1 '''to''' n\n         y[i] := y[i-1] + \u03b1 * (x[i] - y[i-1])\n\nThat is, the change from one filter output to the next is [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the difference between the previous output and the next input. This [[exponential smoothing]] property matches the [[exponential function|exponential]] decay seen in the continuous-time system. As expected, as the [[time constant]] <math>\\scriptstyle RC</math> increases, the discrete-time smoothing parameter <math>\\scriptstyle \\alpha</math> decreases, and the output samples <math>\\scriptstyle (y_1,\\, y_2,\\, \\ldots,\\, y_n)</math> respond more slowly to a change in the input samples <math>\\scriptstyle (x_1,\\, x_2,\\, \\ldots,\\, x_n)</math>; the system has more ''[[inertia]]''.  This filter is an [[infinite-impulse-response]] (IIR) single-pole low-pass filter.\n\n===Finite impulse response===\nFinite-impulse-response filters can be built that approximate to the [[sinc function]] time-domain response of an ideal sharp-cutoff low-pass filter. For minimum distortion the finite impulse response filter has an unbounded number of coefficients operating on an unbounded signal. In practice, the time-domain response must be time truncated and is often of a simplified shape; in the simplest case, a [[running average]] can be used, giving a square time response.<ref>Whilmshurst, T H (1990) ''Signal recovery from noise in electronic instrumentation.'' {{ISBN|9780750300582}} </ref>\n\n===Fourier transform===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}\n\nFor non-realtime filtering, to achieve a low pass filter, the entire signal is usually taken as a looped signal, the Fourier transform is taken, filtered in the frequency domain, followed by an inverse Fourier transform. Only O(n log(n)) operations are required compared to O(n<sup>2</sup>) for the time domain filtering algorithm.\n\nThis can also sometimes be done in real-time, where the signal is delayed long enough to perform the Fourier transformation on shorter, overlapping blocks.\n\n==Continuous-time realization==\n[[File:Butterworth Filter Orders.svg|thumb|350px|Plot of the gain of Butterworth low-pass filters of orders 1 through 5, with [[cutoff frequency]] <math>\\omega_0 = 1</math>. Note that the slope is 20''n'' dB/decade where ''n'' is the filter order.]]\n\nThere are many different types of filter circuits, with different responses to changing frequency.  The frequency response of a filter is generally represented using a [[Bode plot]], and the filter is characterized by its [[cutoff frequency]] and rate of frequency [[roll-off|rolloff]]. In all cases, at the ''cutoff frequency,'' the filter [[attenuate]]s the input power by half or 3&nbsp;dB. So the '''order''' of the filter determines the amount of additional attenuation for frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency.\n\n* A '''first-order filter''', for example, reduces the signal amplitude by half (so power reduces by a factor of 4, or {{nowrap|6 dB)}}, every time the frequency doubles (goes up one [[octave]]); more precisely, the power rolloff approaches 20&nbsp;dB per [[Decade (log scale)|decade]] in the limit of high frequency. The magnitude Bode plot for a first-order filter looks like a horizontal line below the [[cutoff frequency]], and a diagonal line above the cutoff frequency.  There is also a \"knee curve\" at the boundary between the two, which smoothly transitions between the two straight line regions.  If the [[transfer function]] of a first-order low-pass filter has a [[zero (complex analysis)|zero]] as well as a [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]], the Bode plot flattens out again, at some maximum attenuation of high frequencies; such an effect is caused for example by a little bit of the input leaking around the one-pole filter; this one-pole\u2013one-zero filter is still a first-order low-pass. ''See [[Pole\u2013zero plot]] and [[RC circuit]].''\n* A '''second-order filter''' attenuates high frequencies more steeply. The Bode plot for this type of filter resembles that of a first-order filter, except that it falls off more quickly. For example, a second-order [[Butterworth filter]] reduces the signal amplitude to one fourth its original level every time the frequency doubles (so power decreases by 12&nbsp;dB per octave, or 40&nbsp;dB per decade). Other all-pole second-order filters may roll off at different rates initially depending on their [[Q factor]], but approach the same final rate of 12&nbsp;dB per octave; as with the first-order filters, zeroes in the transfer function can change the high-frequency asymptote. See [[RLC circuit]].\n* Third- and higher-order filters are defined similarly.  In general, the final rate of power rolloff for an order-<math>\\scriptstyle n</math> all-pole filter is <math>\\scriptstyle 6n</math> dB per octave (i.e., <math>\\scriptstyle 20n</math> dB per decade).\n\nOn any Butterworth filter, if one extends the horizontal line to the right and the diagonal line to the upper-left (the [[asymptote]]s of the function), they intersect at exactly the ''cutoff frequency''.  The frequency response at the cutoff frequency in a first-order filter is 3&nbsp;dB below the horizontal line.  The various types of filters ([[Butterworth filter]], [[Chebyshev filter]], [[Bessel filter]], etc.) all have different-looking ''knee curves''.  Many second-order filters have \"peaking\" or [[Electrical resonance|resonance]] that puts their frequency response at the cutoff frequency ''above'' the horizontal line. Furthermore, the actual frequency where this peaking occurs can be predicted without calculus, as shown by Cartwright<ref>K. V. Cartwright, P. Russell and E. J. Kaminsky,\"[http://www.lajpe.org/dec2012/8_LAJPE_703_Kenneth_Cartwright_preprint_corr_f.pdf Finding the maximum magnitude response (gain) of second-order filters without calculus],\" Lat. Am. J. Phys. Educ. Vol. 6, No. 4, pp. 559-565, 2012.</ref> et al. For third-order filters, the peaking and its frequency of occurrence can also be predicted without calculus as shown by Cartwright<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cartwright|first=K. V. |author2=P.

''See [[electronic filter]] for other types.''\n\nThe meanings of 'low' and 'high'\u2014that is, the [[cutoff frequency]]\u2014depend on the characteristics of the filter. The term \"low-pass filter\" merely refers to the shape of the filter's response; a high-pass filter could be built that cuts off at a lower frequency than any low-pass filter\u2014it is their responses that set them apart.  Electronic circuits can be devised for any desired frequency range, right up through microwave frequencies (above 1&nbsp;GHz) and higher.\n\n===Laplace notation===\nContinuous-time filters can also be described in terms of the [[Laplace transform]] of their [[impulse response]], in a way that lets all characteristics of the filter be easily analyzed by considering the pattern of poles and zeros of the Laplace transform in the complex plane. (In discrete time, one can similarly consider the [[Z-transform]] of the impulse response.)\n\nFor example, a first-order low-pass filter can be described in Laplace notation as:\n:<math>\n\\frac{\\text{Output}}{\\text{Input}} = K \\frac{1}{\\tau s + 1}\n</math>\n\nwhere ''s'' is the Laplace transform variable, ''\u03c4'' is the filter [[time constant]], and ''K'' is the [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] of the filter in the [[passband]].\n\n== Electronic low-pass filters ==\n\n===First order===\n\n==== RC filter ====\n[[File:RC Divider.svg|thumb|200px|Passive, first order low-pass RC filter]]\n\nOne simple low-pass filter [[electrical circuit|circuit]] consists of a [[resistor]] in series with a [[External electric load|load]], and a [[capacitor]] in parallel with the load. The capacitor exhibits [[Reactance (electronics)|reactance]], and blocks low-frequency signals, forcing them through the load instead. At higher frequencies the reactance drops, and the capacitor effectively functions as a short circuit. The combination of resistance and capacitance gives the [[time constant]] of the filter <math>\\scriptstyle \\tau \\;=\\; RC </math> (represented by the Greek letter [[tau]]). The break frequency, also called the turnover frequency, corner frequency, or [[cutoff frequency]] (in hertz), is determined by the time constant:\n\n:<math>\nf_\\mathrm{c} = {1 \\over 2 \\pi \\tau } = {1 \\over 2 \\pi R C}\n</math>\n\nor equivalently (in [[radian]]s per second):\n\n:<math>\n\\omega_\\mathrm{c} = {1 \\over \\tau} = {1 \\over R C}\n</math>\n\nThis circuit may be understood by considering the time the capacitor needs to charge or discharge through the resistor:\n* At low frequencies, there is plenty of time for the capacitor to charge up to practically the same voltage as the input voltage.\n* At high frequencies, the capacitor only has time to charge up a small amount before the input switches direction. The output goes up and down only a small fraction of the amount the input goes up and down. At double the frequency, there's only time for it to charge up half the amount.\n\nAnother way to understand this circuit is through the concept of [[Reactance (electronics)|reactance]] at a particular frequency:\n* Since [[direct current]] (DC) cannot flow through the capacitor, DC input must flow out the path marked <math>\\scriptstyle V_\\mathrm{out}</math> (analogous to removing the capacitor).\n* Since [[alternating current]] (AC) flows very well through the capacitor, almost as well as it flows through solid wire, AC input flows out through the capacitor, effectively [[short circuit]]ing to ground (analogous to replacing the capacitor with just a wire).\n\nThe capacitor is not an \"on/off\" object (like the block or pass fluidic explanation above).  The capacitor variably acts between these two extremes.  It is the [[Bode plot]] and [[frequency response]] that show this variability.\n\n==== RL filter====\nA resistor\u2013inductor circuit or [[RL filter]] is an [[electric circuit]] composed of [[resistors]] and [[inductors]] driven by a [[voltage source|voltage]] or [[current source]]. A first order RL circuit is composed of one resistor and one inductor and is the simplest type of RL circuit.\n\nA first order RL circuit is one of the simplest [[analog filter|analogue]] [[infinite impulse response]] [[electronic filter]]s. It consists of a [[resistor]] and an [[inductor]], either in [[series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|series]] driven by a [[voltage source]] or in [[series and parallel circuits#Parallel circuits|parallel]] driven by a current source.\n\n=== Second order ===\n\n====RLC filter====\n[[File:RLC_low-pass.svg|thumb|RLC circuit as a low-pass filter]]\nAn [[RLC circuit]]  (the letters R, L and C can be in other orders) is an [[electrical circuit]] consisting of a [[resistor]], an [[inductor]], and a [[capacitor]], connected in series or in parallel.  The RLC part of the name is due to those letters being the usual electrical symbols for [[electrical resistance|resistance]], [[inductance]] and [[capacitance]] respectively.  The circuit forms a [[harmonic oscillator]] for current and will [[resonance|resonate]] in a similar way as an [[LC circuit]] will.  The main difference that the presence of the resistor makes is that any oscillation induced in the circuit will die away over time if it is not kept going by a source.  This effect of the resistor is called [[damping]]. The presence of the resistance also reduces the peak resonant frequency somewhat.  Some resistance is unavoidable in real circuits, even if a resistor is not specifically included as a component.  An ideal, pure LC circuit is an abstraction for the purpose of theory.\n\nThere are many applications for this circuit.  They are used in many different types of [[electronic oscillator|oscillator circuit]]s.  Another important application is for [[tuner (electronics)|tuning]], such as in [[receiver (radio)|radio receivers]] or [[television set]]s, where they are used to select a narrow range of frequencies from the ambient radio waves.  In this role the circuit is often referred to as a tuned circuit.  An RLC circuit can be used as a [[band-pass filter]], [[band-stop filter]], low-pass filter or [[high-pass filter]]. The RLC filter is described as a ''second-order'' circuit, meaning that any voltage or current in the circuit can be described by a second-order [[differential equation]] in circuit analysis.\n\n=== Higher order passive filters ===\nHigher order passive filters can also be constructed (see diagram for a third order example).\n[[File:LowPass3poleICauer.svg|300px|centre|thumb|A third-order low-pass filter ([[Cauer topology]]).

An example is seen in a passenger vehicle that is accelerating in the forward direction - passengers perceive that they are acted upon by a force in the rearward direction pushing them back into their seats. An example in a rotating reference frame is the force that appears to push objects outwards towards the rim of a centrifuge. These apparent forces are examples of fictitious forces.\n\nThe fictitious force '''F''' is due to an object's inertia when the reference frame does not move inertially, and thus begins to accelerate relative to the free object. The fictitious force thus does not arise from any [[Force carrier|physical interaction]] between two objects, such as [[electromagnetism]] or [[contact force]]s, but rather from the acceleration '''a''' of the [[non-inertial reference frame]] itself, which from the viewpoint of the frame now appears to be an acceleration of the object instead, requiring a \"force\" to make this happen. As stated by Iro:<ref name=Iro>{{cite book|author=Harald Iro|title=A Modern Approach to Classical Mechanics|page=180|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-L5ckgdxA5YC&pg=PA179&dq=force+%22non-inertial+%22#PPA180,M1|isbn=981-238-213-5|year=2002|publisher=World Scientific}}</ref><ref name=coordinate>In this connection, it may be noted that a change in coordinate system, for example, from Cartesian to polar, if implemented without any change in relative motion, does not cause the appearance of fictitious forces, despite the fact that the form of the laws of motion varies from one type of curvilinear coordinate system to another.</ref>\n{{Quote|Such an additional force due to nonuniform relative motion of two reference frames is called a ''pseudo-force''.|H. Iro in ''A Modern Approach to Classical Mechanics'' p. 180}}\nAssuming [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]] in the form '''F'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''m''<nowiki/>'''a''', fictitious forces are always proportional to the mass ''m''.\n\nThe fictitious force on an object arises as an imaginary influence, when the frame of reference used to describe the object's motion is accelerating compared to a non-accelerating frame. The fictitious force \"explains,\" using Newton's mechanics, why an object does not follow Newton's laws and \"floats freely\" as if weightless. As a frame can accelerate in any arbitrary way, so can fictitious forces be as arbitrary (but only in direct response to the acceleration of the frame).  However, four fictitious forces are defined for frames accelerated in commonly occurring ways: one caused by any relative acceleration of the origin in a straight line (rectilinear [[acceleration]]);<ref>The term ''d'Alembert force'' often is limited to this case. See Lanczos, for example.</ref> two involving rotation: [[centrifugal force]] and [[Coriolis force]]; and a fourth, called the [[Euler force]], caused by a variable rate of rotation, should that occur. \n\n[[Gravitational field|Gravitational force]] would also be a fictitious force based upon a field model in which particles distort [[spacetime]] due to their mass, such as [[General Relativity]].\n{{short description|A force on objects moving within a reference frame that rotates with respect to an inertial frame.}}\n[[File:Corioliskraftanimation.gif|frame|right|In the inertial frame of reference (upper part of the picture), the black ball moves in a straight line.

To solve [[classical mechanics]] problems exactly in an Earth-bound reference frame, three fictitious forces must be introduced: the [[Coriolis force]], the [[centrifugal force (fictitious)|centrifugal force]] (described below) and the [[Euler force]]. The Euler force is typically ignored because the variations in the angular velocity of the rotating Earth surface are usually insignificant. Both of the other fictitious forces are weak compared to most typical forces in everyday life, but they can be detected under careful conditions. For example, [[L\u00e9on Foucault]] used his [[Foucault pendulum]] to show that a [[Coriolis force]] results from the Earth's rotation. If the Earth were to rotate twenty times faster (making each day only ~72 minutes long), people could easily get the impression that such fictitious forces were pulling on them, as on a spinning carousel; people in temperate and tropical latitudes would, in fact, need to hold on in order to avoid being launched into orbit by the centrifugal force.\n\n==Detection of non-inertial reference frame==\n{{See also|Inertial frame of reference}}\nObservers inside a closed box that is moving with a constant [[velocity]] cannot detect their own motion; however, observers within an accelerating reference frame can detect that they are in a non-inertial reference frame from the fictitious forces that arise. For example, for straight-line acceleration [[Vladimir Arnold]] presents the following theorem:<ref name=\"Arnol\u02b9d\">{{cite book |title=Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pd8-s6rOt_cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:Mathematical+intitle:Methods+intitle:of+intitle:Classical+intitle:Mechanics#PPA129,M1|author=Vladimir Igorevich Arnold |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |isbn=0-387-96890-3 |year=1989 |pages=\u00a727 pp. 129 ff.}}</ref>\n{{blockquote|In a coordinate system ''K'' which moves by translation relative to an inertial system ''k'', the motion of a mechanical system takes place as if the coordinate system were inertial, but on every point of mass ''m'' an additional \"inertial force\" acted: '''F'''&nbsp;{{=}} \u2212''m'''''a''', where '''a'''  is the acceleration of the system ''K''.}}\nOther accelerations also give rise to fictitious forces, as described mathematically [[#Mathematical derivation of fictitious forces|below]]. The physical explanation of motions in an inertial frame is the simplest possible, requiring no fictitious forces: fictitious forces are zero, providing a means to distinguish inertial frames from others.<ref name=transformations>As part of the requirement of simplicity, to be an inertial frame, in all other frames that differ only by a uniform rate of translation, the description should be of the same form. However, in the Newtonian system the [[Galilean transformation]] connects these frames and in the special theory of relativity the [[Lorentz transformation]] connects them. The two transformations agree for speeds of translation much less than the [[speed of light]].</ref>\n\nAn example of the detection of a non-inertial, rotating reference frame is the precession of a [[Foucault pendulum]]. In the non-inertial frame of the Earth, the fictitious [[Coriolis force]] is necessary to explain observations. In an inertial frame outside the Earth, no such fictitious force is necessary.\n\n==Examples of fictitious forces==\n\n===Acceleration in a straight line===\n[[Image:Accelerating car.PNG|thumb|350px|Figure 1: ''Top panel'': accelerating car of mass ''M'' with passenger of mass ''m''. The force from the axle is (''m'' + ''M'')'''a'''. In the inertial frame, this is the only force on the car and passenger.<br /> ''Center panel'': an exploded view in the inertial frame. The passenger is subject to the accelerating force ''m'''''a'''. The seat (assumed of negligible mass) is compressed between the reaction force \u2013''m'''''a''' and the applied force from the car ''m'''''a'''. The car is subject to the net acceleration force ''M'''''a''' that is the difference between the applied force (''m'' + ''M'')'''a''' from the axle and the reaction from the seat \u2212''m'''''a'''. <br />''Bottom panel'': an exploded view in the non-inertial frame. In the non-inertial frame where the car is not accelerating, the force from the axle is balanced by a fictitious backward force \u2212(''m'' + ''M'')'''a''', a portion \u2212''M'''''a''' applied to the car, and \u2212''m'''''a''' to the passenger. The car is subject to the fictitious force \u2212''M'''''a''' and the force (''m'' + ''M'')'''a''' from the axle. The sum of these forces ''m'''''a''' is applied to the seat, which exerts a reaction \u2212''m'''''a''' upon the car, so zero net force is applied to the car. The seat (assumed massless) transmits the force ''m'''''a''' to the passenger, who is subject also to the fictitious force \u2212''m'''''a''', resulting in zero net force on the passenger. The passenger exerts a reaction force \u2212''m'''''a''' upon the seat, which is therefore compressed. In all frames the compression of the seat is the same, and the force delivered by the axle is the same.]]\nFigure 1 (top) shows an accelerating car. When a car [[acceleration|accelerates]], a passenger feels like they're being pushed back into the seat. In an inertial frame of reference attached to the road, there is no physical force moving the rider backward. However, in the rider's non-inertial reference frame attached to the accelerating car, there ''is'' a backward fictitious force. We mention two possible reasons for the force to clarify its (the force's) existence:<ref name=Motz>{{cite book |title=The Concepts of Science: From Newton to Einstein |author1=Lloyd Motz |author2=Jefferson Hane Weaver |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SnufjnGnqD8C&pg=PA95&dq=history+velocity+%22law+of+inertia%22#PPA101,M1|page=101 |isbn=0-7382-0834-5 |publisher=Basic Books |year=2002}}</ref>\n# Figure 1 (center panel). To an observer at rest on an  [[inertial reference frame]] (like the ground), the car will seem to accelerate. In order for the passenger to stay inside the car, a force must be exerted on the passenger. This force is exerted by the seat, which has started to move forward with the car and is compressed against the passenger until it transmits the full force to keep the passenger moving with the car. Thus, the forces exerted by the seat are unbalanced,so the passenger is accelerating in this frame.\n# Figure 1 (bottom panel). From the point of view of the interior of the car, an accelerating reference frame, there is a fictitious force pushing the passenger backwards, with magnitude equal to the [[mass]] of the passenger times the acceleration of the car. This force pushes the passenger back into the seat, until the seat compresses and provides an equal and opposite force. Thereafter, the passenger is stationary in this frame, because the fictitious force and the real force of the seat are balanced.\n\nHow can the accelerating frame be discovered to be non-inertial? In the accelerating frame, everything appears to be subject to zero net force, and nothing moves. Nonetheless, compression of the seat is observed and is explained in the accelerating frame (and in an inertial frame) by the force of acceleration on the seat from the car on one side, and the opposing force of reaction to acceleration by the passenger on the other. Identification of the accelerating frame as non-inertial cannot be based simply on the compression of the seat, which all observers can explain; rather it is based on the ''simplicity'' of the physical explanation for this compression.\n\nThe explanation of the seat compression in the accelerating frame requires not only the thrust from the axle of the car, but additional (fictitious) forces. In an inertial frame, only the thrust from the axle is necessary. Therefore, the inertial frame has a ''simpler'' physical explanation (not necessarily a simpler mathematical formulation, however), indicating the accelerating frame is a non-inertial frame of reference. In other words, in the inertial frame, fictitious forces are zero. See [[inertial frame]] for more detail.\n\nThis example illustrates how fictitious forces arise from switching from an inertial to a non-inertial reference frame. Calculations of physical quantities (compression of the seat, required force from the axle) made in any frame give the same answers, but in some cases calculations are easier to make in a non-inertial frame. (In this simple example, the calculations are equally complex for the two frames described.)\n\n:{|class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"60%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!''Animation:'' driving from block to block\n|-\n|[[Image:Carframe.gif|thumb|360px|center|Map and car frame perspectives of physical (red) and fictitious (blue) forces for a car driving from one stop sign to the next.]]\nIn this illustration the car accelerates after a stop sign until midway up the block, at which point the driver is immediately off the accelerator and onto the brake so as to make the next stop.\n|}\n\n===Circular motion===\n{{See also|Centrifugal force|Coriolis force}}\nA similar effect occurs in [[circular motion]], circular from the standpoint of an inertial frame of reference attached to the road. When seen from a non-inertial frame of reference attached to the car, the fictitious force called the [[centrifugal force (fictitious)|centrifugal force]] appears.  If the car is moving at constant speed around a circular section of road, the occupants will feel pushed outside by this centrifugal force, away from the center of the turn.  Again the situation can be viewed from inertial or non-inertial frames:\n\n# From the viewpoint of an inertial reference frame stationary with respect to the road, the car is accelerating toward the center of the circle. This acceleration is necessary because the ''direction'' of the velocity is changing, despite a constant speed. This inward acceleration is called [[centripetal acceleration]] and requires a [[centripetal force]] to maintain the circular motion.  This force is exerted by the ground upon the wheels, in this case from the [[friction]] between the wheels and the road.<ref>The force in this example is known as ''[[Ground reaction force|ground reaction]],'' and it could exist even without friction, for example, a sled running down a curve of a bobsled track.</ref> The car is accelerating, due to the unbalanced force, which causes it to move in a circle. (See also [[banked turn]].)\n# From the viewpoint of a rotating frame, moving with the car, there is a fictitious centrifugal force that tends to push the car toward the outside of the road (and to push the occupants toward the outside of the car). The centrifugal force balances the friction between wheels and road, making the car stationary in this non-inertial frame.\n\nA classic example of fictitious force in circular motion is the experiment of [[rotating spheres]] tied by a cord and spinning around their center of mass. In this case, as with the linearly accelerating car example, the identification of a rotating, non-inertial frame of reference can be based upon the vanishing of fictitious forces. In an inertial frame, fictitious forces are not necessary to explain the tension in the string joining the spheres. In a rotating frame, Coriolis and centrifugal forces must be introduced to predict the observed tension.\n\nIn the rotating reference frame perceived on the surface of the Earth, centrifugal force reduces the apparent force of gravity by about one part in a thousand, depending on latitude. This reduction is zero at the poles, maximum at the equator.\n\n:{|class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"60%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!''Animation:'' object released from a carousel\n|-\n|[[Image:Spinframe.gif|thumb|360px|center|Map and spin frame perspectives of physical (red) and fictitious (blue) forces for an object released from a carousel.]]\nFrom the map frame perspective, what's dangerous on losing centripetal acceleration may be your speed.  From the spin frame perspective, the danger instead may lie with the geometric acceleration which gives rise to that fictitious force.''Note:'' With some browsers, you can hit [Esc] to freeze the motion for more detailed analysis.  However you may have to reload the page to restart.\n|}\n\nThe fictitious [[Coriolis force]], which is observed in rotational frames, is ordinarily visible only in very large-scale motion like the projectile motion of long-range guns or the circulation of the Earth's atmosphere (see [[Rossby number]]). Neglecting air resistance, an object dropped from a 50-meter-high tower at the [[equator]] will fall 7.7 millimeters eastward of the spot below where it is dropped because of the Coriolis force.<ref name=Kleppner>{{cite book |author1=Daniel Kleppner |author2=Robert J.

Consider a distant star observed from a rotating spacecraft. In the reference frame co-rotating with the spacecraft, the distant star appears to move along a circular trajectory around the spacecraft. The apparent motion of the star is an apparent centripetal acceleration. Just like in the example above of the car in circular motion, the centrifugal force has the same magnitude as the fictitious centripetal force, but is directed in the opposite, centrifugal direction. In this case the Coriolis force is twice the magnitude of the centrifugal force, and it points in centripetal direction. The vector sum of the centrifugal force and the Coriolis force is the total fictitious force, which in this case points in centripetal direction.\n\n===Fictitious forces and work===\nFictitious forces can be considered to do [[Mechanical work|work]], provided that they move an object on a [[trajectory]] that changes its [[energy]] from [[potential energy|potential]] to [[kinetic energy|kinetic]]. For example, consider a person in a rotating chair holding a weight in their outstretched hand. If they pull their hand inward toward their body, from the perspective of the rotating reference frame, they have done work against the centrifugal force. When the weight is let go, it spontaneously flies outward relative to the rotating reference frame, because the centrifugal force does work on the object, converting its potential energy into kinetic. From an inertial viewpoint, of course, the object flies away from them because it is suddenly allowed to move in a straight line. This illustrates that the work done, like the total potential and kinetic energy of an object, can be different in a non-inertial frame than an inertial one.\n\n==Gravity as a fictitious force==\n{{Main article|General relativity}}\nThe notion of \"fictitious force\" comes up in Einstein's general theory of relativity.<ref name=Rohrlich>{{cite book |title=Classical charged particles |author=Fritz Rohrlich |page=40 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lJrPrP6L6tQC&pg=PA39&dq=acceleration+transformation+formula+%22Coriolis+force%22#PPA40,M1|isbn=981-270-004-8 |year=2007 |publisher=World Scientific |location=Singapore}}</ref><ref name=Stephani>{{cite book |title=Relativity: An Introduction to Special and General Relativity |author=Hans Stephani |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WAW-4nd-OeIC&pg=PA104&dq=acceleration+transformation+formula+%22Coriolis+force%22#PPA105,M1|page=105 |isbn=0-521-01069-1 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge UK}}</ref> All fictitious forces are proportional to the mass of the object upon which they act, which is also true for [[gravity]].<ref name=\"E\u00f6tv\u00f6s\">The gravitational mass and the inertial mass are found experimentally to be equal to within experimental error.</ref>  This led [[Albert Einstein]] to wonder whether gravity was a fictitious force as well. He noted that a [[freefall]]ing observer in a closed box would not be able to detect the force of gravity; hence, freefalling reference frames are equivalent to an inertial reference frame (the [[equivalence principle]]). Following up on this insight, Einstein was able to formulate a theory with gravity as a fictitious force and attributing the apparent acceleration of gravity to the [[curvature]] of [[spacetime]]. This idea underlies Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]].

Then\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{B} = \\sum_{j=1}^3 x_j \\mathbf{u}_j \\ . </math>\n\nThe interpretation of this equation is that '''x'''<sub>B</sub> is the vector displacement of the particle as  expressed in terms of the coordinates in frame B at time ''t''. From frame A the particle is located at:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{A} =\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{AB} +  \\sum_{j=1}^3 x_j \\mathbf{u}_j \\ . </math>\n\nAs an aside, the unit vectors {&thinsp;'''u'''<sub>''j''</sub>&thinsp;} cannot change magnitude, so derivatives of these vectors express only rotation of the coordinate system B. On the other hand, vector '''X'''<sub>AB</sub> simply locates the origin of frame B relative to frame A, and so cannot include rotation of frame B.\n\nTaking a time derivative, the velocity  of the particle is:\n\n:<math> \\frac {d \\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{A}}{dt} =\\frac{d \\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{AB}}{dt} + \\sum_{j=1}^3 \\frac{dx_j}{dt} \\mathbf{u}_j + \\sum_{j=1}^3 x_j \\frac{d \\mathbf{u}_j}{dt} \\ . </math>\n\nThe second term summation is the velocity of the particle, say '''v'''<sub>B</sub> as measured in frame B. That is:\n\n:<math> \\frac {d \\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{A}}{dt} =\\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{AB}+ \\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{B} + \\sum_{j=1}^3 x_j \\frac{d \\mathbf{u}_j}{dt}. </math>\n\nThe interpretation of this equation is that the velocity of the particle seen by observers in frame A consists of what observers in frame B call the velocity, namely '''v'''<sub>B</sub>, plus two extra terms related to the rate of change of the frame-B coordinate axes. One of these is simply the velocity of the moving origin '''v'''<sub>AB</sub>. The other is a contribution to velocity due to the fact that different locations in the non-inertial frame have different apparent velocities due to rotation of the frame; a point seen from a rotating frame has a rotational component of velocity that is greater the further the point is from the origin.\n\nTo find the acceleration, another time differentiation provides:\n\n:<math> \\frac {d^2 \\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{A}}{dt^2} = \\mathbf{a}_\\mathrm{AB}+\\frac {d\\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{B}}{dt} + \\sum_{j=1}^3 \\frac {dx_j}{dt} \\frac{d \\mathbf{u}_j}{dt} + \\sum_{j=1}^3 x_j \\frac{d^2 \\mathbf{u}_j}{dt^2}. </math>\n\nUsing the same formula already used for the time derivative of '''x'''<sub>B</sub>, the velocity derivative on the right is:\n\n:<math>\\frac {d\\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{B}}{dt} =\\sum_{j=1}^3 \\frac{d v_j}{dt} \\mathbf{u}_j+ \\sum_{j=1}^3 v_j \\frac{d \\mathbf{u}_j}{dt} =\\mathbf{a}_\\mathrm{B} + \\sum_{j=1}^3 v_j \\frac{d \\mathbf{u}_j}{dt}. </math>\n\n{{anchor|Eq. 1}}Consequently,\n{{NumBlk|::|<math> \\frac {d^2 \\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{A}}{dt^2}=\\mathbf{a}_\\mathrm{AB}+\\mathbf{a}_\\mathrm{B} + 2\\ \\sum_{j=1}^3 v_j \\frac{d \\mathbf{u}_j}{dt} + \\sum_{j=1}^3 x_j \\frac{d^2 \\mathbf{u}_j}{dt^2}.</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nThe interpretation of this equation is as follows: the acceleration of the particle in frame A consists of what observers in frame B  call the particle acceleration '''a'''<sub>B</sub>, but in addition there are three acceleration terms related to the movement of the frame-B coordinate axes: one term related to the acceleration of the origin of frame B, namely '''a'''<sub>AB</sub>, and two terms related to rotation of frame B. Consequently, observers in B will see the particle motion as possessing \"extra\" acceleration, which they will attribute to \"forces\" acting on the particle, but which observers in A say are \"fictitious\" forces arising simply because observers in B do not recognize the non-inertial nature of frame B.\n\nThe factor of two in the Coriolis force arises from two equal contributions: (i) the apparent change of an inertially constant velocity with time because rotation makes the direction of the velocity seem to change (a ''d'''''v'''<sub>B</sub>/d''t'' term) and (ii) an apparent change in the velocity of an object when its position changes, putting it nearer to or further from the axis of rotation (the change in <math>\\sum x_j\\, d\\mathbf{u}_j/dt</math> due to change in ''x <sub>j</sub>'' ).\n\nTo put matters in terms of forces, the accelerations are multiplied by the particle mass:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{F}_\\mathrm{A} = \\mathbf{F}_\\mathrm{B} + m\\mathbf{a}_\\mathrm{AB}+ 2m \\sum_{j=1}^3 v_j \\frac{d \\mathbf{u}_j}{dt} + m \\sum_{j=1}^3 x_j \\frac{d^2 \\mathbf{u}_j}{dt^2}\\ . </math>\n\nThe force observed in frame B, '''F'''<sub>B</sub> = ''m'''''a'''<sub>B</sub> is related to the actual force on the particle, '''F'''<sub>A</sub>, by\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{F}_\\mathrm{B} = \\mathbf{F}_\\mathrm{A} + \\mathbf{F}_\\mathrm{fictitious},</math>\n\nwhere:\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{F}_\\mathrm{fictitious} = -m\\mathbf{a}_\\mathrm{AB} - 2m\\sum_{j=1}^3 v_j \\frac{d \\mathbf{u}_j}{dt} - m \\sum_{j=1}^3 x_j \\frac{d^2 \\mathbf{u}_j}{dt^2}\\ . </math>\n\nThus, we can solve problems in frame B by assuming that Newton's second law holds (with respect to quantities in that frame) and treating '''F'''<sub>fictitious</sub> as an additional force.<ref name=\"Arnol\u02b9d\"/><ref name=Taylor>{{cite book |title=Classical Mechanics |author=John Robert Taylor |location=Sausalito CA |isbn=1-891389-22-X |year=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P1kCtNr-pJsC&pg=PP1&dq=isbn=1-891389-22-X#PPA343,M1 |publisher=University Science Books|pages=343\u2013344}}</ref><ref>Kleppner, pages 62\u201363</ref>\n\nBelow are a number of examples applying this result for fictitious forces. More examples can be found in the article on [[centrifugal force]].\n\n===Rotating coordinate systems===\nA common situation in which noninertial reference frames are useful is when the reference frame is rotating. Because such rotational motion is non-inertial, due to the acceleration present in any rotational motion, a fictitious force can always be invoked by using a rotational frame of reference. Despite this complication, the use of fictitious forces often simplifies the calculations involved.\n\nTo derive expressions for the fictitious forces, derivatives are needed for the apparent time rate of change of vectors that take into account time-variation of the coordinate axes. If the rotation of frame 'B' is represented by a vector '''\u03a9''' pointed along the axis of rotation with orientation given by the [[right-hand rule]], and with magnitude given by\n\n:<math> |\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} | = \\frac {d \\theta }{dt} = \\omega (t), </math>\n\nthen the time derivative of any of the three unit vectors describing frame B is<ref name=Taylor/><ref>See for example, {{cite book |author1=JL Synge |author2=BA Griffith |title=Principles of Mechanics |url=https://archive.org/details/principlesofmech031468mbp |publisher=McGraw-Hill |edition=2nd |year=1949 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/principlesofmech031468mbp/page/n343 348]\u2013349}}</ref>\n\n:<math> \\frac {d  \\mathbf{u}_j (t)}{dt} = \\boldsymbol{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{u}_j (t), </math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\frac {d^2  \\mathbf{u}_j (t)}{dt^2}= \\frac{d\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}}{dt} \\times \\mathbf{u}_j +\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} \\times \\frac{d \\mathbf{u}_j (t)}{dt} = \\frac{d\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}}{dt} \\times \\mathbf{u}_j+ \\boldsymbol{\\Omega} \\times \\left[  \\boldsymbol{\\Omega} \\times  \\mathbf{u}_j (t) \\right], </math>\n\nas is verified using the properties of the [[vector cross product]].

As seen in the rotational frame, the acceleration '''a'''<sub>B</sub> of the particle is given by rearrangement of the above equation as:\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{a}_\\mathrm{B} = \\mathbf{a}_\\mathrm{A} - 2\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{B} - \\boldsymbol{\\Omega} \\times (\\boldsymbol\\Omega \\times   \\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{B})  - \\frac{d \\boldsymbol\\Omega}{dt} \\times \\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{B}.\n</math>\n\nThe net force upon the object according to observers in the rotating frame is '''F'''<sub>B</sub> = ''m'''''a'''<sub>B</sub>.

Thus, in this case, the fictitious force is primarily a uniform centrifugal force along the axis of the tube, away from the center of rotation, with a value |'''F'''<sub>Fict</sub>| = \u03c9<sup>2</sup> ''R'', where ''R'' is the distance of the matter in the tube from the center of the centrifuge. It is standard specification of a centrifuge to use the \"effective\" radius of the centrifuge to estimate its  ability to provide centrifugal force. Thus, a first estimate of centrifugal force in a centrifuge can be based upon the distance of the tubes from the center of rotation, and corrections applied if needed.<ref name=Singh>{{cite book |title=Constitutive and Centrifuge Modelling: Two Extremes |author1=Bea K Lalmahomed |author2=Sarah Springman |author3=Bhawani Singh |isbn=90-5809-361-1 |year=2002 |publisher=Taylor and Francis |page=82 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJkz_IBZZS0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=centrifuge#PPT102,M1  }}</ref><ref name=Nen>{{cite book |title=Consolidation of Soils: Testing and Evaluation: a Symposium |author=Raymond Nen |isbn=0-8031-0446-4 |year=1986 |publisher=ASTM International |page=590 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a-BKqGTXA6kC&pg=PA590&dq=radius+centrifuge+effective}}</ref>\n\nAlso, the test tube confines motion to the direction down the length of the tube, so '''v'''<sub>B</sub> is opposite to '''u'''<sub>1</sub> and the Coriolis force is opposite to '''u'''<sub>2</sub>, that is, against the wall of the tube.

A rider on the carousel walks radially across it at constant speed, in what appears to the walker to be the straight line path inclined at 45\u00b0 in Figure 5. To the stationary observer, however, the walker travels a spiral path. The points identified on both paths in Figure 5 correspond to the same times spaced at equal time intervals. We ask how two observers, one on the carousel and one in an inertial frame, formulate what they see using Newton's laws.\n\n====Inertial observer====\nThe observer at rest describes the path followed by the walker as a spiral. Adopting the coordinate system shown in Figure 5, the trajectory is described by '''r'''(''t''):\n:<math>\\mathbf{r}(t) =R(t)\\mathbf{u}_R = \\begin{bmatrix} x(t) \\\\ y(t) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} R(t)\\cos (\\omega t + \\pi/4) \\\\ R(t)\\sin (\\omega t + \\pi/4) \\end{bmatrix}, </math>\nwhere the added \u03c0/4 sets the path angle at 45\u00b0 to start with (just an arbitrary choice of direction), '''u'''<sub>''R''</sub> is a unit vector in the radial direction pointing from the center of the carousel to the walker at time ''t''.  The radial distance ''R''(''t'') increases steadily with time according to:\n:<math>R(t) = s t,</math>\nwith ''s'' the speed of walking. According to simple kinematics, the velocity is then the first derivative of the trajectory:\n:<math>\\mathbf{v}(t) = \\frac{dR}{dt} \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos (\\omega t + \\pi/4) \\\\ \\sin (\\omega t + \\pi/4) \\end{bmatrix} + \\omega R(t) \\begin{bmatrix} -\\sin(\\omega t + \\pi/4) \\\\ \\cos (\\omega t + \\pi/4) \\end{bmatrix}</math>\n::<math>=\\frac{dR}{dt} \\mathbf{u}_R + \\omega R(t) \\mathbf{u}_{\\theta}, </math>\nwith '''u'''<sub>\u03b8</sub> a unit vector perpendicular to '''u'''<sub>R</sub> at time ''t'' (as can be verified by noticing that the vector [[dot product]] with the radial vector is zero) and pointing in the direction of travel.\nThe acceleration is the first derivative of the velocity:\n:<math>\\mathbf{a}(t) = \\frac{d^2 R}{dt^2} \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos (\\omega t + \\pi/4) \\\\ \\sin (\\omega t + \\pi/4) \\end{bmatrix} + 2 \\frac {dR}{dt} \\omega \\begin{bmatrix} -\\sin(\\omega t + \\pi/4) \\\\ \\cos (\\omega t + \\pi/4) \\end{bmatrix} - \\omega^2 R(t) \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos (\\omega t + \\pi/4) \\\\ \\sin (\\omega t + \\pi/4) \\end{bmatrix}</math>\n::<math>=2s\\omega \\begin{bmatrix} -\\sin(\\omega t + \\pi/4) \\\\ \\cos (\\omega t + \\pi/4) \\end{bmatrix} -\\omega^2 R(t) \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos (\\omega t + \\pi/4) \\\\ \\sin (\\omega t + \\pi/4) \\end{bmatrix}</math>\n::<math>=2s\\ \\omega \\   \\mathbf{u}_{\\theta}-\\omega^2 R(t)\\ \\mathbf{u}_R  \\ . </math>\nThe last term in the acceleration is radially inward of magnitude \u03c9<sup>2</sup> ''R'', which is therefore the instantaneous [[centripetal force|centripetal acceleration]] of [[circular motion]].<ref>{{Anchor|Note1}}'''Note''': There is a subtlety here: the distance ''R'' is the instantaneous distance from the rotational axis ''of the carousel''. However, it is not the [[osculating circle|radius of curvature]] ''of the walker's trajectory'' as seen by the inertial observer, and the unit vector '''u'''<sub>R</sub> is not perpendicular to the path. Thus, the designation \"centripetal acceleration\" is an approximate use of this term. See, for example, {{cite book |title=[[Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students]] |author=Howard D. Curtis |isbn=0-7506-6169-0 |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |year=2005 |page=5 }} and\n{{cite book |title=Accelerator physics |author=S. Y.

Its magnitude is 2''s''\u03c9, and it represents the acceleration of the walker as the edge of the carousel is neared, and the arc of circle traveled in a fixed time increases, as can be seen by the increased spacing between points for equal time steps on the spiral in Figure 5 as the outer edge of the carousel is approached.\n\nApplying Newton's laws, multiplying the acceleration by the mass of the walker, the inertial observer concludes that the walker is subject to two forces: the inward, radially directed centripetal force, and another force perpendicular to the radial direction that is proportional to the speed of the walker.\n\n====Rotating observer====\nThe rotating observer sees the walker travel a straight line from the center of the carousel to the periphery, as shown in Figure 5. Moreover, the rotating observer sees that the walker moves at a constant speed in the same direction, so applying Newton's law of inertia, there is ''zero'' force upon the walker. These conclusions do not agree with the inertial observer. To obtain agreement, the rotating observer has to introduce fictitious forces that appear to exist in the rotating world, even though there is no apparent reason for them, no apparent gravitational mass, electric charge or what have you, that could account for these fictitious forces.\n\nTo agree with the inertial observer, the forces applied to the walker must be exactly those found above. They can be related to the general formulas already derived, namely:\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{fict}} =\n- 2 m \\boldsymbol\\Omega  \\times \\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{B} - m \\boldsymbol\\Omega  \\times (\\boldsymbol\\Omega \\times \\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{B} ) - m \\frac{d \\boldsymbol\\Omega}{dt} \\times \\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{B}.\n</math>\nIn this example, the velocity seen in the rotating frame is:\n:<math>\\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{B} = s \\mathbf{u}_R, </math>\nwith '''u'''<sub>R</sub> a unit vector in the radial direction. The position of the walker as seen on the carousel is:\n:<math>\\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{B} = R(t)\\mathbf{u}_R, </math>\nand the time derivative of '''\u03a9''' is zero for uniform angular rotation. Noticing that\n:<math>\\boldsymbol\\Omega  \\times \\mathbf{u}_R =\\omega \\mathbf{u}_{\\theta} \\ </math>\nand\n:<math>\\boldsymbol\\Omega  \\times \\mathbf{u}_{\\theta} =-\\omega \\mathbf{u}_R \\ ,</math>\nwe find:\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{fict}}  = - 2 m \\omega s \\mathbf{u}_{\\theta} + m \\omega^2 R(t) \\mathbf{u}_R.\n</math>\nTo obtain a [[straight-line motion]] in the rotating world, a force exactly opposite in sign to the fictitious force must be applied to reduce the net force on the walker to zero, so Newton's law of inertia will predict a straight line motion, in agreement with what the rotating observer sees. The fictitious forces that must be combated are the [[Coriolis force]] (first term) and the [[centrifugal force]] (second term). (These terms are approximate.<ref>A circle about the axis of rotation is not the [[osculating circle]] of the walker's trajectory, so \"centrifugal\" and \"Coriolis\" are approximate uses for these terms. [[#Note1|See note]].</ref>) By applying forces to counter these two fictitious forces, the rotating observer ends up applying exactly the same forces upon the walker that the inertial observer predicted were needed.\n\nBecause they differ only by the constant walking velocity, the walker and the rotational observer see the same accelerations. From the walker's perspective, the fictitious force is experienced as real, and combating this force is necessary to stay on a straight line radial path holding constant speed. It's like battling a crosswind while being thrown to the edge of the carousel.\n\n===Observation===\nNotice that this [[kinematics|kinematical]] discussion does not delve into the mechanism by which the required forces are generated. That is the subject of [[kinetics (physics)|kinetics]]. In the case of the carousel, the kinetic discussion would involve perhaps a study of the walker's shoes and the friction they need to generate against the floor of the carousel, or perhaps the dynamics of skateboarding, if the walker switched to travel by skateboard. Whatever the means of travel across the carousel, the forces calculated above must be realized. A very rough analogy is heating your house: you must have a certain temperature to be comfortable, but whether you heat by burning gas or by burning coal is another problem. Kinematics sets the thermostat, kinetics fires the furnace.\n\n==See also==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-1-of-3}}\n* [[Newton's laws of motion]]\n* [[Inertial reference frame]]\n* [[Non-inertial reference frame]]\n* [[Rotating reference frame]]\n* [[Coriolis force]]\n* [[centrifugal force (fictitious)|Centrifugal force]]\n* [[Gravity]]\n* [[General relativity]]\n* [[d'Alembert's principle]] of inertial forces\n{{Col-2-of-3}}\n* [[Centripetal force]]\n* [[Circular motion]]\n* [[Uniform circular motion]]\n* [[Statics]]\n* [[Kinetics (physics)]]\n* [[Kinematics]]\n* [[Applied mechanics]]\n* [[Analytical mechanics]]\n* [[Dynamics (physics)]]\n{{Col-3-of-3}}\n* [[Classical mechanics]]\n* [[Generalized force]]\n* [[Free motion equation]]\n* [[Orthogonal coordinates]]\n* [[Curvilinear coordinates]]\n* [[Generalized coordinates]]\n* [[Frenet\u2013Serret formulas]]\n{{Col-end}}\n{{Portal|Physics}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |author=[[Lev D.

An example is seen in a passenger vehicle that is accelerating in the forward direction - passengers perceive that they are acted upon by a force in the rearward direction pushing them back into their seats. An example in a rotating reference frame is the force that appears to push objects outwards towards the rim of a centrifuge. These apparent forces are examples of fictitious forces.\n\nThe fictitious force '''F''' is due to an object's inertia when the reference frame does not move inertially, and thus begins to accelerate relative to the free object. The fictitious force thus does not arise from any [[Force carrier|physical interaction]] between two objects, such as [[electromagnetism]] or [[contact force]]s, but rather from the acceleration '''a''' of the [[non-inertial reference frame]] itself, which from the viewpoint of the frame now appears to be an acceleration of the object instead, requiring a \"force\" to make this happen. As stated by Iro:<ref name=Iro>{{cite book|author=Harald Iro|title=A Modern Approach to Classical Mechanics|page=180|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-L5ckgdxA5YC&pg=PA179&dq=force+%22non-inertial+%22#PPA180,M1|isbn=981-238-213-5|year=2002|publisher=World Scientific}}</ref><ref name=coordinate>In this connection, it may be noted that a change in coordinate system, for example, from Cartesian to polar, if implemented without any change in relative motion, does not cause the appearance of fictitious forces, despite the fact that the form of the laws of motion varies from one type of curvilinear coordinate system to another.</ref>\n{{Quote|Such an additional force due to nonuniform relative motion of two reference frames is called a ''pseudo-force''.|H.

The fictitious force \"explains,\" using Newton's mechanics, why an object does not follow Newton's laws and \"floats freely\" as if weightless. As a frame can accelerate in any arbitrary way, so can fictitious forces be as arbitrary (but only in direct response to the acceleration of the frame).  However, four fictitious forces are defined for frames accelerated in commonly occurring ways: one caused by any relative acceleration of the origin in a straight line (rectilinear [[acceleration]]);<ref>The term ''d'Alembert force'' often is limited to this case.

To solve [[classical mechanics]] problems exactly in an Earth-bound reference frame, three fictitious forces must be introduced: the [[Coriolis force]], the [[centrifugal force (fictitious)|centrifugal force]] (described below) and the [[Euler force]]. The Euler force is typically ignored because the variations in the angular velocity of the rotating Earth surface are usually insignificant. Both of the other fictitious forces are weak compared to most typical forces in everyday life, but they can be detected under careful conditions. For example, [[L\u00e9on Foucault]] used his [[Foucault pendulum]] to show that a [[Coriolis force]] results from the Earth's rotation. If the Earth were to rotate twenty times faster (making each day only ~72 minutes long), people could easily get the impression that such fictitious forces were pulling on them, as on a spinning carousel; people in temperate and tropical latitudes would, in fact, need to hold on in order to avoid being launched into orbit by the centrifugal force.\n\n==Detection of non-inertial reference frame==\n{{See also|Inertial frame of reference}}\nObservers inside a closed box that is moving with a constant [[velocity]] cannot detect their own motion; however, observers within an accelerating reference frame can detect that they are in a non-inertial reference frame from the fictitious forces that arise. For example, for straight-line acceleration [[Vladimir Arnold]] presents the following theorem:<ref name=\"Arnol\u02b9d\">{{cite book |title=Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pd8-s6rOt_cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:Mathematical+intitle:Methods+intitle:of+intitle:Classical+intitle:Mechanics#PPA129,M1|author=Vladimir Igorevich Arnold |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |isbn=0-387-96890-3 |year=1989 |pages=\u00a727 pp. 129 ff.}}</ref>\n{{blockquote|In a coordinate system ''K'' which moves by translation relative to an inertial system ''k'', the motion of a mechanical system takes place as if the coordinate system were inertial, but on every point of mass ''m'' an additional \"inertial force\" acted: '''F'''&nbsp;{{=}} \u2212''m'''''a''', where '''a'''  is the acceleration of the system ''K''.}}\nOther accelerations also give rise to fictitious forces, as described mathematically [[#Mathematical derivation of fictitious forces|below]].

The two transformations agree for speeds of translation much less than the [[speed of light]].</ref>\n\nAn example of the detection of a non-inertial, rotating reference frame is the precession of a [[Foucault pendulum]]. In the non-inertial frame of the Earth, the fictitious [[Coriolis force]] is necessary to explain observations. In an inertial frame outside the Earth, no such fictitious force is necessary.\n\n==Examples of fictitious forces==\n\n===Acceleration in a straight line===\n[[Image:Accelerating car.PNG|thumb|350px|Figure 1: ''Top panel'': accelerating car of mass ''M'' with passenger of mass ''m''. The force from the axle is (''m'' + ''M'')'''a'''. In the inertial frame, this is the only force on the car and passenger.<br /> ''Center panel'': an exploded view in the inertial frame.

The car is subject to the fictitious force \u2212''M'''''a''' and the force (''m'' + ''M'')'''a''' from the axle. The sum of these forces ''m'''''a''' is applied to the seat, which exerts a reaction \u2212''m'''''a''' upon the car, so zero net force is applied to the car. The seat (assumed massless) transmits the force ''m'''''a''' to the passenger, who is subject also to the fictitious force \u2212''m'''''a''', resulting in zero net force on the passenger. The passenger exerts a reaction force \u2212''m'''''a''' upon the seat, which is therefore compressed. In all frames the compression of the seat is the same, and the force delivered by the axle is the same.]]\nFigure 1 (top) shows an accelerating car. When a car [[acceleration|accelerates]], a passenger feels like they're being pushed back into the seat. In an inertial frame of reference attached to the road, there is no physical force moving the rider backward. However, in the rider's non-inertial reference frame attached to the accelerating car, there ''is'' a backward fictitious force. We mention two possible reasons for the force to clarify its (the force's) existence:<ref name=Motz>{{cite book |title=The Concepts of Science: From Newton to Einstein |author1=Lloyd Motz |author2=Jefferson Hane Weaver |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SnufjnGnqD8C&pg=PA95&dq=history+velocity+%22law+of+inertia%22#PPA101,M1|page=101 |isbn=0-7382-0834-5 |publisher=Basic Books |year=2002}}</ref>\n# Figure 1 (center panel). To an observer at rest on an  [[inertial reference frame]] (like the ground), the car will seem to accelerate. In order for the passenger to stay inside the car, a force must be exerted on the passenger. This force is exerted by the seat, which has started to move forward with the car and is compressed against the passenger until it transmits the full force to keep the passenger moving with the car. Thus, the forces exerted by the seat are unbalanced,so the passenger is accelerating in this frame.\n# Figure 1 (bottom panel). From the point of view of the interior of the car, an accelerating reference frame, there is a fictitious force pushing the passenger backwards, with magnitude equal to the [[mass]] of the passenger times the acceleration of the car. This force pushes the passenger back into the seat, until the seat compresses and provides an equal and opposite force. Thereafter, the passenger is stationary in this frame, because the fictitious force and the real force of the seat are balanced.\n\nHow can the accelerating frame be discovered to be non-inertial? In the accelerating frame, everything appears to be subject to zero net force, and nothing moves. Nonetheless, compression of the seat is observed and is explained in the accelerating frame (and in an inertial frame) by the force of acceleration on the seat from the car on one side, and the opposing force of reaction to acceleration by the passenger on the other. Identification of the accelerating frame as non-inertial cannot be based simply on the compression of the seat, which all observers can explain; rather it is based on the ''simplicity'' of the physical explanation for this compression.\n\nThe explanation of the seat compression in the accelerating frame requires not only the thrust from the axle of the car, but additional (fictitious) forces. In an inertial frame, only the thrust from the axle is necessary. Therefore, the inertial frame has a ''simpler'' physical explanation (not necessarily a simpler mathematical formulation, however), indicating the accelerating frame is a non-inertial frame of reference. In other words, in the inertial frame, fictitious forces are zero. See [[inertial frame]] for more detail.\n\nThis example illustrates how fictitious forces arise from switching from an inertial to a non-inertial reference frame. Calculations of physical quantities (compression of the seat, required force from the axle) made in any frame give the same answers, but in some cases calculations are easier to make in a non-inertial frame. (In this simple example, the calculations are equally complex for the two frames described.)\n\n:{|class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"60%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!''Animation:'' driving from block to block\n|-\n|[[Image:Carframe.gif|thumb|360px|center|Map and car frame perspectives of physical (red) and fictitious (blue) forces for a car driving from one stop sign to the next.]]\nIn this illustration the car accelerates after a stop sign until midway up the block, at which point the driver is immediately off the accelerator and onto the brake so as to make the next stop.\n|}\n\n===Circular motion===\n{{See also|Centrifugal force|Coriolis force}}\nA similar effect occurs in [[circular motion]], circular from the standpoint of an inertial frame of reference attached to the road. When seen from a non-inertial frame of reference attached to the car, the fictitious force called the [[centrifugal force (fictitious)|centrifugal force]] appears.  If the car is moving at constant speed around a circular section of road, the occupants will feel pushed outside by this centrifugal force, away from the center of the turn.  Again the situation can be viewed from inertial or non-inertial frames:\n\n# From the viewpoint of an inertial reference frame stationary with respect to the road, the car is accelerating toward the center of the circle. This acceleration is necessary because the ''direction'' of the velocity is changing, despite a constant speed. This inward acceleration is called [[centripetal acceleration]] and requires a [[centripetal force]] to maintain the circular motion.  This force is exerted by the ground upon the wheels, in this case from the [[friction]] between the wheels and the road.<ref>The force in this example is known as ''[[Ground reaction force|ground reaction]],'' and it could exist even without friction, for example, a sled running down a curve of a bobsled track.</ref> The car is accelerating, due to the unbalanced force, which causes it to move in a circle. (See also [[banked turn]].)\n# From the viewpoint of a rotating frame, moving with the car, there is a fictitious centrifugal force that tends to push the car toward the outside of the road (and to push the occupants toward the outside of the car). The centrifugal force balances the friction between wheels and road, making the car stationary in this non-inertial frame.\n\nA classic example of fictitious force in circular motion is the experiment of [[rotating spheres]] tied by a cord and spinning around their center of mass. In this case, as with the linearly accelerating car example, the identification of a rotating, non-inertial frame of reference can be based upon the vanishing of fictitious forces. In an inertial frame, fictitious forces are not necessary to explain the tension in the string joining the spheres. In a rotating frame, Coriolis and centrifugal forces must be introduced to predict the observed tension.\n\nIn the rotating reference frame perceived on the surface of the Earth, centrifugal force reduces the apparent force of gravity by about one part in a thousand, depending on latitude. This reduction is zero at the poles, maximum at the equator.\n\n:{|class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"60%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!''Animation:'' object released from a carousel\n|-\n|[[Image:Spinframe.gif|thumb|360px|center|Map and spin frame perspectives of physical (red) and fictitious (blue) forces for an object released from a carousel.]]\nFrom the map frame perspective, what's dangerous on losing centripetal acceleration may be your speed.  From the spin frame perspective, the danger instead may lie with the geometric acceleration which gives rise to that fictitious force.''Note:'' With some browsers, you can hit [Esc] to freeze the motion for more detailed analysis.  However you may have to reload the page to restart.\n|}\n\nThe fictitious [[Coriolis force]], which is observed in rotational frames, is ordinarily visible only in very large-scale motion like the projectile motion of long-range guns or the circulation of the Earth's atmosphere (see [[Rossby number]]). Neglecting air resistance, an object dropped from a 50-meter-high tower at the [[equator]] will fall 7.7 millimeters eastward of the spot below where it is dropped because of the Coriolis force.<ref name=Kleppner>{{cite book |author1=Daniel Kleppner |author2=Robert J. Kolenkow |year=1973 |title=An Introduction to Mechanics |publisher=McGraw-Hill |page=[https://archive.org/details/introductiontome00dani/page/363 363] |isbn=0-07-035048-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontome00dani/page/363 }}</ref>\n\nIn the case of distant objects and a rotating reference frame, what must be taken into account is the resultant force of centrifugal and Coriolis force. Consider a distant star observed from a rotating spacecraft. In the reference frame co-rotating with the spacecraft, the distant star appears to move along a circular trajectory around the spacecraft. The apparent motion of the star is an apparent centripetal acceleration. Just like in the example above of the car in circular motion, the centrifugal force has the same magnitude as the fictitious centripetal force, but is directed in the opposite, centrifugal direction. In this case the Coriolis force is twice the magnitude of the centrifugal force, and it points in centripetal direction. The vector sum of the centrifugal force and the Coriolis force is the total fictitious force, which in this case points in centripetal direction.\n\n===Fictitious forces and work===\nFictitious forces can be considered to do [[Mechanical work|work]], provided that they move an object on a [[trajectory]] that changes its [[energy]] from [[potential energy|potential]] to [[kinetic energy|kinetic]]. For example, consider a person in a rotating chair holding a weight in their outstretched hand. If they pull their hand inward toward their body, from the perspective of the rotating reference frame, they have done work against the centrifugal force. When the weight is let go, it spontaneously flies outward relative to the rotating reference frame, because the centrifugal force does work on the object, converting its potential energy into kinetic. From an inertial viewpoint, of course, the object flies away from them because it is suddenly allowed to move in a straight line. This illustrates that the work done, like the total potential and kinetic energy of an object, can be different in a non-inertial frame than an inertial one.\n\n==Gravity as a fictitious force==\n{{Main article|General relativity}}\nThe notion of \"fictitious force\" comes up in Einstein's general theory of relativity.<ref name=Rohrlich>{{cite book |title=Classical charged particles |author=Fritz Rohrlich |page=40 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lJrPrP6L6tQC&pg=PA39&dq=acceleration+transformation+formula+%22Coriolis+force%22#PPA40,M1|isbn=981-270-004-8 |year=2007 |publisher=World Scientific |location=Singapore}}</ref><ref name=Stephani>{{cite book |title=Relativity: An Introduction to Special and General Relativity |author=Hans Stephani |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WAW-4nd-OeIC&pg=PA104&dq=acceleration+transformation+formula+%22Coriolis+force%22#PPA105,M1|page=105 |isbn=0-521-01069-1 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge UK}}</ref> All fictitious forces are proportional to the mass of the object upon which they act, which is also true for [[gravity]].<ref name=\"E\u00f6tv\u00f6s\">The gravitational mass and the inertial mass are found experimentally to be equal to within experimental error.</ref>  This led [[Albert Einstein]] to wonder whether gravity was a fictitious force as well. He noted that a [[freefall]]ing observer in a closed box would not be able to detect the force of gravity; hence, freefalling reference frames are equivalent to an inertial reference frame (the [[equivalence principle]]). Following up on this insight, Einstein was able to formulate a theory with gravity as a fictitious force and attributing the apparent acceleration of gravity to the [[curvature]] of [[spacetime]]. This idea underlies Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]].

Then\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{B} = \\sum_{j=1}^3 x_j \\mathbf{u}_j \\ . </math>\n\nThe interpretation of this equation is that '''x'''<sub>B</sub> is the vector displacement of the particle as  expressed in terms of the coordinates in frame B at time ''t''. From frame A the particle is located at:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{A} =\\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{AB} +  \\sum_{j=1}^3 x_j \\mathbf{u}_j \\ . </math>\n\nAs an aside, the unit vectors {&thinsp;'''u'''<sub>''j''</sub>&thinsp;} cannot change magnitude, so derivatives of these vectors express only rotation of the coordinate system B. On the other hand, vector '''X'''<sub>AB</sub> simply locates the origin of frame B relative to frame A, and so cannot include rotation of frame B.\n\nTaking a time derivative, the velocity  of the particle is:\n\n:<math> \\frac {d \\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{A}}{dt} =\\frac{d \\mathbf{X}_\\mathrm{AB}}{dt} + \\sum_{j=1}^3 \\frac{dx_j}{dt} \\mathbf{u}_j + \\sum_{j=1}^3 x_j \\frac{d \\mathbf{u}_j}{dt} \\ . </math>\n\nThe second term summation is the velocity of the particle, say '''v'''<sub>B</sub> as measured in frame B. That is:\n\n:<math> \\frac {d \\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{A}}{dt} =\\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{AB}+ \\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{B} + \\sum_{j=1}^3 x_j \\frac{d \\mathbf{u}_j}{dt}. </math>\n\nThe interpretation of this equation is that the velocity of the particle seen by observers in frame A consists of what observers in frame B call the velocity, namely '''v'''<sub>B</sub>, plus two extra terms related to the rate of change of the frame-B coordinate axes. One of these is simply the velocity of the moving origin '''v'''<sub>AB</sub>. The other is a contribution to velocity due to the fact that different locations in the non-inertial frame have different apparent velocities due to rotation of the frame; a point seen from a rotating frame has a rotational component of velocity that is greater the further the point is from the origin.\n\nTo find the acceleration, another time differentiation provides:\n\n:<math> \\frac {d^2 \\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{A}}{dt^2} = \\mathbf{a}_\\mathrm{AB}+\\frac {d\\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{B}}{dt} + \\sum_{j=1}^3 \\frac {dx_j}{dt} \\frac{d \\mathbf{u}_j}{dt} + \\sum_{j=1}^3 x_j \\frac{d^2 \\mathbf{u}_j}{dt^2}. </math>\n\nUsing the same formula already used for the time derivative of '''x'''<sub>B</sub>, the velocity derivative on the right is:\n\n:<math>\\frac {d\\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{B}}{dt} =\\sum_{j=1}^3 \\frac{d v_j}{dt} \\mathbf{u}_j+ \\sum_{j=1}^3 v_j \\frac{d \\mathbf{u}_j}{dt} =\\mathbf{a}_\\mathrm{B} + \\sum_{j=1}^3 v_j \\frac{d \\mathbf{u}_j}{dt}. </math>\n\n{{anchor|Eq. 1}}Consequently,\n:{{NumBlk|:|<math> \\frac {d^2 \\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{A}}{dt^2}=\\mathbf{a}_\\mathrm{AB}+\\mathbf{a}_\\mathrm{B} + 2\\ \\sum_{j=1}^3 v_j \\frac{d \\mathbf{u}_j}{dt} + \\sum_{j=1}^3 x_j \\frac{d^2 \\mathbf{u}_j}{dt^2}.</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nThe interpretation of this equation is as follows: the acceleration of the particle in frame A consists of what observers in frame B  call the particle acceleration '''a'''<sub>B</sub>, but in addition there are three acceleration terms related to the movement of the frame-B coordinate axes: one term related to the acceleration of the origin of frame B, namely '''a'''<sub>AB</sub>, and two terms related to rotation of frame B. Consequently, observers in B will see the particle motion as possessing \"extra\" acceleration, which they will attribute to \"forces\" acting on the particle, but which observers in A say are \"fictitious\" forces arising simply because observers in B do not recognize the non-inertial nature of frame B.\n\nThe factor of two in the Coriolis force arises from two equal contributions: (i) the apparent change of an inertially constant velocity with time because rotation makes the direction of the velocity seem to change (a ''d'''''v'''<sub>B</sub>/d''t'' term) and (ii) an apparent change in the velocity of an object when its position changes, putting it nearer to or further from the axis of rotation (the change in <math>\\sum x_j\\, d\\mathbf{u}_j/dt</math> due to change in ''x <sub>j</sub>'' ).\n\nTo put matters in terms of forces, the accelerations are multiplied by the particle mass:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{F}_\\mathrm{A} = \\mathbf{F}_\\mathrm{B} + m\\mathbf{a}_\\mathrm{AB}+ 2m \\sum_{j=1}^3 v_j \\frac{d \\mathbf{u}_j}{dt} + m \\sum_{j=1}^3 x_j \\frac{d^2 \\mathbf{u}_j}{dt^2}\\ . </math>\n\nThe force observed in frame B, '''F'''<sub>B</sub> = ''m'''''a'''<sub>B</sub> is related to the actual force on the particle, '''F'''<sub>A</sub>, by\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{F}_\\mathrm{B} = \\mathbf{F}_\\mathrm{A} + \\mathbf{F}_\\mathrm{fictitious},</math>\n\nwhere:\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{F}_\\mathrm{fictitious} = -m\\mathbf{a}_\\mathrm{AB} - 2m\\sum_{j=1}^3 v_j \\frac{d \\mathbf{u}_j}{dt} - m \\sum_{j=1}^3 x_j \\frac{d^2 \\mathbf{u}_j}{dt^2}\\ . </math>\n\nThus, we can solve problems in frame B by assuming that Newton's second law holds (with respect to quantities in that frame) and treating '''F'''<sub>fictitious</sub> as an additional force.<ref name=\"Arnol\u02b9d\"/><ref name=Taylor>{{cite book |title=Classical Mechanics |author=John Robert Taylor |location=Sausalito CA |isbn=1-891389-22-X |year=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P1kCtNr-pJsC&pg=PP1&dq=isbn=1-891389-22-X#PPA343,M1 |publisher=University Science Books|pages=343\u2013344}}</ref><ref>Kleppner, pages 62\u201363</ref>\n\nBelow are a number of examples applying this result for fictitious forces.

Because such rotational motion is non-inertial, due to the acceleration present in any rotational motion, a fictitious force can always be invoked by using a rotational frame of reference. Despite this complication, the use of fictitious forces often simplifies the calculations involved.\n\nTo derive expressions for the fictitious forces, derivatives are needed for the apparent time rate of change of vectors that take into account time-variation of the coordinate axes.

In the rotating frame the centrifugal force is related to the distance of the object from the origin of frame ''B'', while in the case of an orbiting frame, the centrifugal force is independent of the distance of the object from the origin of frame ''B'', but instead depends upon the distance of the origin of frame ''B'' from ''its'' center of rotation, resulting in the ''same'' centrifugal fictitious force for ''all'' objects observed in frame ''B''.\n\n===Orbiting and rotating===\n{{See also|Clohessy-Wiltshire equations}}\n[[Image:Center-facing orbiting coordinate system.PNG|thumb|250px|Figure 4: An orbiting coordinate system ''B'' similar to Figure 3, but in which unit vectors '''u'''<sub>j</sub>, j = 1, 2, 3 rotate to face the rotational axis, while the origin of the coordinate system ''B'' moves at constant angular rate \u03c9 about the fixed axis '''\u03a9'''.]]\nAs a combination example, Figure 4 shows a coordinate system ''B'' that orbits inertial frame ''A'' as in Figure 3, but the coordinate axes in frame ''B'' turn so unit vector '''u'''<sub>1</sub> always points toward the center of rotation.

Thus, in this case, the fictitious force is primarily a uniform centrifugal force along the axis of the tube, away from the center of rotation, with a value |'''F'''<sub>Fict</sub>| = \u03c9<sup>2</sup> ''R'', where ''R'' is the distance of the matter in the tube from the center of the centrifuge.

A rider on the carousel walks radially across it at constant speed, in what appears to the walker to be the straight line path inclined at 45\u00b0 in Figure 5. To the stationary observer, however, the walker travels a spiral path. The points identified on both paths in Figure 5 correspond to the same times spaced at equal time intervals. We ask how two observers, one on the carousel and one in an inertial frame, formulate what they see using Newton's laws.\n\n====Inertial observer====\nThe observer at rest describes the path followed by the walker as a spiral. Adopting the coordinate system shown in Figure 5, the trajectory is described by '''r'''(''t''):\n:<math>\\mathbf{r}(t) =R(t)\\mathbf{u}_R = \\begin{bmatrix} x(t) \\\\ y(t) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} R(t)\\cos (\\omega t + \\pi/4) \\\\ R(t)\\sin (\\omega t + \\pi/4) \\end{bmatrix}, </math>\nwhere the added \u03c0/4 sets the path angle at 45\u00b0 to start with (just an arbitrary choice of direction), '''u'''<sub>''R''</sub> is a unit vector in the radial direction pointing from the center of the carousel to the walker at time ''t''.  The radial distance ''R''(''t'') increases steadily with time according to:\n:<math>R(t) = s t,</math>\nwith ''s'' the speed of walking. According to simple kinematics, the velocity is then the first derivative of the trajectory:\n:<math>\\mathbf{v}(t) = \\frac{dR}{dt} \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos (\\omega t + \\pi/4) \\\\ \\sin (\\omega t + \\pi/4) \\end{bmatrix} + \\omega R(t) \\begin{bmatrix} -\\sin(\\omega t + \\pi/4) \\\\ \\cos (\\omega t + \\pi/4) \\end{bmatrix}</math>\n::<math>=\\frac{dR}{dt} \\mathbf{u}_R + \\omega R(t) \\mathbf{u}_{\\theta}, </math>\nwith '''u'''<sub>\u03b8</sub> a unit vector perpendicular to '''u'''<sub>R</sub> at time ''t'' (as can be verified by noticing that the vector [[dot product]] with the radial vector is zero) and pointing in the direction of travel.\nThe acceleration is the first derivative of the velocity:\n:<math>\\mathbf{a}(t) = \\frac{d^2 R}{dt^2} \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos (\\omega t + \\pi/4) \\\\ \\sin (\\omega t + \\pi/4) \\end{bmatrix} + 2 \\frac {dR}{dt} \\omega \\begin{bmatrix} -\\sin(\\omega t + \\pi/4) \\\\ \\cos (\\omega t + \\pi/4) \\end{bmatrix} - \\omega^2 R(t) \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos (\\omega t + \\pi/4) \\\\ \\sin (\\omega t + \\pi/4) \\end{bmatrix}</math>\n::<math>=2s\\omega \\begin{bmatrix} -\\sin(\\omega t + \\pi/4) \\\\ \\cos (\\omega t + \\pi/4) \\end{bmatrix} -\\omega^2 R(t) \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos (\\omega t + \\pi/4) \\\\ \\sin (\\omega t + \\pi/4) \\end{bmatrix}</math>\n::<math>=2s\\ \\omega \\   \\mathbf{u}_{\\theta}-\\omega^2 R(t)\\ \\mathbf{u}_R  \\ . </math>\nThe last term in the acceleration is radially inward of magnitude \u03c9<sup>2</sup> ''R'', which is therefore the instantaneous [[centripetal force|centripetal acceleration]] of [[circular motion]].<ref>{{Anchor|Note1}}'''Note''': There is a subtlety here: the distance ''R'' is the instantaneous distance from the rotational axis ''of the carousel''. However, it is not the [[osculating circle|radius of curvature]] ''of the walker's trajectory'' as seen by the inertial observer, and the unit vector '''u'''<sub>R</sub> is not perpendicular to the path. Thus, the designation \"centripetal acceleration\" is an approximate use of this term. See, for example, {{cite book |title=[[Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students]] |author=Howard D.

Its magnitude is 2''s''\u03c9, and it represents the acceleration of the walker as the edge of the carousel is neared, and the arc of circle traveled in a fixed time increases, as can be seen by the increased spacing between points for equal time steps on the spiral in Figure 5 as the outer edge of the carousel is approached.\n\nApplying Newton's laws, multiplying the acceleration by the mass of the walker, the inertial observer concludes that the walker is subject to two forces: the inward, radially directed centripetal force, and another force perpendicular to the radial direction that is proportional to the speed of the walker.\n\n====Rotating observer====\nThe rotating observer sees the walker travel a straight line from the center of the carousel to the periphery, as shown in Figure 5. Moreover, the rotating observer sees that the walker moves at a constant speed in the same direction, so applying Newton's law of inertia, there is ''zero'' force upon the walker. These conclusions do not agree with the inertial observer. To obtain agreement, the rotating observer has to introduce fictitious forces that appear to exist in the rotating world, even though there is no apparent reason for them, no apparent gravitational mass, electric charge or what have you, that could account for these fictitious forces.\n\nTo agree with the inertial observer, the forces applied to the walker must be exactly those found above. They can be related to the general formulas already derived, namely:\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{fict}} =\n- 2 m \\boldsymbol\\Omega  \\times \\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{B} - m \\boldsymbol\\Omega  \\times (\\boldsymbol\\Omega \\times \\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{B} ) - m \\frac{d \\boldsymbol\\Omega}{dt} \\times \\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{B}.\n</math>\nIn this example, the velocity seen in the rotating frame is:\n:<math>\\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{B} = s \\mathbf{u}_R, </math>\nwith '''u'''<sub>R</sub> a unit vector in the radial direction. The position of the walker as seen on the carousel is:\n:<math>\\mathbf{x}_\\mathrm{B} = R(t)\\mathbf{u}_R, </math>\nand the time derivative of '''\u03a9''' is zero for uniform angular rotation. Noticing that\n:<math>\\boldsymbol\\Omega  \\times \\mathbf{u}_R =\\omega \\mathbf{u}_{\\theta} \\ </math>\nand\n:<math>\\boldsymbol\\Omega  \\times \\mathbf{u}_{\\theta} =-\\omega \\mathbf{u}_R \\ ,</math>\nwe find:\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{fict}}  = - 2 m \\omega s \\mathbf{u}_{\\theta} + m \\omega^2 R(t) \\mathbf{u}_R.\n</math>\nTo obtain a [[straight-line motion]] in the rotating world, a force exactly opposite in sign to the fictitious force must be applied to reduce the net force on the walker to zero, so Newton's law of inertia will predict a straight line motion, in agreement with what the rotating observer sees. The fictitious forces that must be combated are the [[Coriolis force]] (first term) and the [[centrifugal force]] (second term). (These terms are approximate.<ref>A circle about the axis of rotation is not the [[osculating circle]] of the walker's trajectory, so \"centrifugal\" and \"Coriolis\" are approximate uses for these terms. [[#Note1|See note]].</ref>) By applying forces to counter these two fictitious forces, the rotating observer ends up applying exactly the same forces upon the walker that the inertial observer predicted were needed.\n\nBecause they differ only by the constant walking velocity, the walker and the rotational observer see the same accelerations. From the walker's perspective, the fictitious force is experienced as real, and combating this force is necessary to stay on a straight line radial path holding constant speed. It's like battling a crosswind while being thrown to the edge of the carousel.\n\n===Observation===\nNotice that this [[kinematics|kinematical]] discussion does not delve into the mechanism by which the required forces are generated. That is the subject of [[kinetics (physics)|kinetics]]. In the case of the carousel, the kinetic discussion would involve perhaps a study of the walker's shoes and the friction they need to generate against the floor of the carousel, or perhaps the dynamics of skateboarding, if the walker switched to travel by skateboard. Whatever the means of travel across the carousel, the forces calculated above must be realized. A very rough analogy is heating your house: you must have a certain temperature to be comfortable, but whether you heat by burning gas or by burning coal is another problem. Kinematics sets the thermostat, kinetics fires the furnace.\n\n==See also==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-1-of-3}}\n* [[Newton's laws of motion]]\n* [[Inertial reference frame]]\n* [[Non-inertial reference frame]]\n* [[Rotating reference frame]]\n* [[Coriolis force]]\n* [[centrifugal force (fictitious)|Centrifugal force]]\n* [[Gravity]]\n* [[General relativity]]\n* [[d'Alembert's principle]] of inertial forces\n{{Col-2-of-3}}\n* [[Centripetal force]]\n* [[Circular motion]]\n* [[Uniform circular motion]]\n* [[Statics]]\n* [[Kinetics (physics)]]\n* [[Kinematics]]\n* [[Applied mechanics]]\n* [[Analytical mechanics]]\n* [[Dynamics (physics)]]\n{{Col-3-of-3}}\n* [[Classical mechanics]]\n* [[Generalized force]]\n* [[Free motion equation]]\n* [[Orthogonal coordinates]]\n* [[Curvilinear coordinates]]\n* [[Generalized coordinates]]\n* [[Frenet\u2013Serret formulas]]\n{{Col-end}}\n{{Portal|Physics}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |author=[[Lev D.

{"title_page": "Kerr metric", "text_new": "{{General relativity sidebar |solutions}}\n\nThe '''Kerr metric''' or '''Kerr geometry''' describes the geometry of empty [[spacetime]] around a rotating uncharged [[axially-symmetric]] [[black hole]] with a quasispherical [[event horizon]]. The Kerr [[metric tensor|metric]] is an [[Exact solutions in general relativity|exact solution]] of the [[Einstein field equations]] of [[general relativity]]; these equations are highly [[nonlinear system|non-linear]], which makes exact solutions very difficult to find.\n\n==Overview==\nThe Kerr metric is a generalization to a rotating body of the [[Schwarzschild metric]], discovered by [[Karl Schwarzschild]] in 1915, which described the geometry of [[spacetime]] around an uncharged, spherically-symmetric, and non-rotating body. The corresponding solution for a ''charged'', spherical, non-rotating body, the [[Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m metric]], was discovered soon afterwards (1916\u20131918). However, the exact solution for an uncharged, ''rotating'' black-hole, the Kerr metric, remained unsolved until 1963, when it was discovered by [[Roy Kerr]].<ref name=kerr_1963>{{cite journal |last=Kerr |first=Roy P. | authorlink=Roy Kerr | date=1963 | title=Gravitational Field of a Spinning Mass as an Example of Algebraically Special Metrics | journal=Physical Review Letters | volume=11 | issue=5 | pages=237\u2013238 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.11.237 | bibcode=1963PhRvL..11..237K }}</ref><ref name=melia2009>Melia, Fulvio (2009). \"Cracking the Einstein code: relativity and the birth of black hole physics, with an Afterword by Roy Kerr\", Princeton University Press, Princeton, {{ISBN|978-0226519517}}</ref>{{rp|69-81}} The natural extension to a charged, rotating black-hole, the [[Kerr\u2013Newman metric]], was discovered shortly thereafter in 1965. These four related solutions may be summarized by the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1.0em auto;\"\n! \n! Non-rotating (''J'' = 0)\n! Rotating (''J'' \u2260 0)\n|- \n! Uncharged (''Q'' = 0)\n| [[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild]]\n| Kerr\n|-\n!

The first measurement of this frame dragging effect was done in 2011 by the [[Gravity Probe B]] experiment. Roughly speaking, this effect predicts that objects coming close to a rotating mass will be entrained to participate in its rotation, not because of any applied force or torque that can be felt, but rather because of the swirling curvature of spacetime itself associated with rotating bodies. In the case of a rotating black hole, at close enough distances, all objects \u2013&nbsp;even light&nbsp;\u2013 ''must'' rotate with the black hole; the region where this holds is called the [[ergosphere]].\n\nRotating black holes have surfaces where the metric seems to have apparent [[coordinate singularity|singularities]]; the size and shape of these surfaces depends on the black hole's [[mass]] and [[angular momentum]]. The outer surface encloses the [[ergosphere]] and has a shape similar to a flattened sphere. The inner surface marks the [[event horizon]]; objects passing into the interior of this horizon can never again communicate with the world outside that horizon. However, neither surface is a true singularity, since their apparent singularity can be eliminated in a different [[coordinate system]]{{Citation needed|reason=first mention of alternate coordinate system, but without citation reader is unable to explore or verify this claim, very interested thanks|date=March 2019}}. Objects between these two surfaces must co-rotate with the rotating black hole, as noted above; this feature can in principle be used to extract energy from a rotating black hole, up to its [[invariant mass]] energy, ''Mc''<sup>2</sup>.\n\nThe LIGO experiment that first detected gravitational waves, announced in 2016, also provided the [[First observation of gravitational waves|first direct observation]] of a pair of Kerr black holes.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Abbot|first1=B.P.|title=Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=11 February 2016|volume=116|issue=6|pages=061102|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102|arxiv = 1602.03837 |bibcode = 2016PhRvL.116f1102A|pmid=26918975}}<!--|accessdate=24 February 2016--></ref>\n\n==Metric==\nThe Kerr metric is commonly expressed in one of two forms, the Boyer\u2013Lindquist form and the Kerr\u2013Schild form.

An \"ice skater\", in orbit over the equator and rotationally at rest with respect to the stars, extends her arms. The arm extended toward the black hole will be torqued spinward. The arm extended away from the black hole will be torqued anti-spinward. She will therefore be rotationally sped up, in a counter-rotating sense to the black hole. This is the opposite of what happens in everyday experience. If she is already rotating at a certain speed when she extends her arms, inertial effects and frame-dragging effects will balance and her spin will not change. Due to the [[Equivalence principle|Principle of Equivalence]] gravitational effects are locally indistinguishable from inertial effects, so this rotation rate, at which when she extends her arms nothing happens, is her local reference for non-rotation. This frame is rotating with respect to the fixed stars and counter-rotating with respect to the black hole. A useful metaphor is a [[planetary gear]] system with the black hole being the sun gear, the ice skater being a planetary gear and the outside universe being the ring gear. This can also be interpreted through [[Mach's principle]].\n\n==Important surfaces==\n[[File:Kerr-surfaces.png|thumb|Location of the horizons, ergospheres and the ring singularity of the Kerr spacetime in Cartesian Kerr-Schild coordinates.<ref name=\"visser35\">{{cite arxiv |eprint=0706.0622v3 |title=The Kerr spacetime: A brief introduction |at=p.&nbsp;15, Eq.&nbsp;60-61, p.&nbsp;24, p.&nbsp;35|last1=Visser |first1=Matt |year=2007 |class=gr-qc }}</ref>]]\n[[File:Kerr.black.hole.shadow.and.horizons.thumb.gif|220px|thumb|link=File:Kerr.black.hole.shadow.and.horizons.gif|Comparison of the shadow (black) and the important surfaces (white) of a black hole.

The inner surface corresponds to an [[event horizon]] similar to that observed in the [[Schwarzschild metric]]; this occurs where the purely radial component ''g''{{sub|rr}} of the metric goes to infinity. Solving the quadratic equation {{frac|1|''g''{{sub|''rr''}}}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 yields the solution:\n:<math>r_{\\rm H}^{\\pm} = \\frac{r_{s} \\pm \\sqrt{r_{s}^{2} - 4a^{2}\\,}}{2} \\ </math>\n\nwhich in natural units (that give ''G''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''M''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''c''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1) simplifies to:\n:<math> \\ r_{\\rm H}^{\\pm} = 1 \\pm \\sqrt{1-a^2\\,}</math>\n\nAnother apparent singularity occurs where the purely temporal component ''g''{{sub|tt}} of the metric changes sign from positive to negative. Again solving a quadratic equation ''g''{{sub|tt}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 yields the solution:\n:<math>r_{\\rm E}^{\\pm} = \\frac{r_{s} \\pm \\sqrt{r_{s}^{2} - 4a^{2} \\cos^{2}\\theta\\,}}{2} \\ </math>\n\nor in natural units:\n:<math> \\ r_{\\rm E}^{\\pm} = 1 \\pm \\sqrt{1-a^2 \\cos ^2\\theta \\,}</math>\n\nDue to the cos{{sup|2}}''\u03b8'' term in the square root, this outer surface resembles a flattened sphere that touches the inner surface at the poles of the rotation axis, where the colatitude ''\u03b8'' equals 0 or ''\u03c0''; the space between these two surfaces is called the [[ergosphere]]. Within this volume, the purely temporal component ''g''{{sub|tt}} is negative, i.e., acts like a purely spatial metric component. Consequently, particles within this ergosphere must co-rotate with the inner mass, if they are to retain their time-like character. A moving particle experiences a positive [[proper time]] along its [[worldline]], its path through [[spacetime]]. However, this is impossible within the ergosphere, where ''g''{{sub|tt}} is negative, unless the particle is co-rotating with the interior mass ''M'' with an angular speed at least of ''\u03a9''. Thus, no particle can rotate opposite to the central mass within the ergosphere.\n\nAs with the event horizon in the [[Schwarzschild metric]], the apparent singularities at ''r''{{sub|H}} and ''r''{{sub|E}} are illusions created by the choice of coordinates (i.e., they are  [[coordinate singularities]]). In fact, the space-time can be smoothly continued through them by an appropriate choice of coordinates.\n\n==Ergosphere and the Penrose process==\n{{main|Penrose process}}\n\nA black hole in general is surrounded by a surface, called the [[event horizon]] and situated at the [[Schwarzschild radius]] for a nonrotating black hole, where the escape velocity is equal to the velocity of light. Within this  surface, no observer/particle can maintain itself at a constant radius. It is forced to fall inwards, and so this is sometimes called the ''static limit''.\n<!--- [[File:Ergosphere.svg|thumb|right|250px|ergosphere of a rotating black hole|Two important surfaces around a rotating black hole. The inner sphere is the static limit (the event horizon). It is the inner boundary of a region called the [[ergoregion | ergosphere]]. The oblate spheroidal surface, touching the event horizon at the poles, is the outer boundary of the ergosphere. Within the ergosphere a particle is forced (dragging of space and time) to rotate and may gain energy at the cost of the rotational energy of the black hole ([[Penrose process]]).]]  -->\n\nA rotating black hole has the same static limit at its event horizon but there is an additional surface outside the event horizon named the \"ergosurface\" given by\n:<math>(r-M)^{2} = M^{2}-J^{2}\\cos^{2}\\theta</math>\n\nin [[Boyer\u2013Lindquist coordinates]], which can be intuitively characterized as the sphere where \"the rotational velocity of the surrounding space\" is dragged along with the velocity of light. Within this sphere the dragging is greater than the speed of light, and any observer/particle is forced to co-rotate.\n\nThe region outside the event horizon but inside the surface where the rotational velocity is the speed of light, is called the ''ergosphere'' (from Greek ''ergon'' meaning ''work''). Particles falling within the ergosphere are forced to rotate faster and thereby gain energy. Because they are still outside the event horizon, they may escape the black hole. The net process is that the rotating black hole emits energetic particles at the cost of its own total energy. The possibility of extracting spin energy from a rotating black hole was first proposed by the mathematician [[Roger Penrose]] in 1969 and is thus called the [[Penrose process]]. Rotating black holes in astrophysics are a potential source of large amounts of energy and are used to explain energetic phenomena, such as [[gamma-ray burst]]s.\n\n==Features of the Kerr geometry==\n\nThe Kerr geometry exhibits many noteworthy features: the maximal analytic extension includes a sequence of [[asymptotically flat]] exterior regions, each associated with an [[ergosphere]], stationary limit surfaces, [[event horizon]]s, [[Cauchy horizon]]s, [[closed timelike curve]]s, and a ring-shaped [[Gravitational singularity|curvature singularity]]. The [[geodesic equation]] can be solved exactly in closed form. In addition to two [[Killing vector fields]] (corresponding to ''[[time translation]]'' and ''axisymmetry''), the Kerr geometry admits a remarkable [[Killing tensor]]. There is a pair of principal null congruences (one ''ingoing'' and one ''outgoing''). The [[Weyl tensor]] is [[algebraically special]], in fact it has [[Petrov classification|Petrov type]] '''D'''. The [[global spacetime structure|global structure]] is known. Topologically, the  [[homotopy type]] of the Kerr spacetime can be simply characterized as a line with circles attached at each integer point.\n\nNote that the inner Kerr geometry is unstable with regard to perturbations in the interior region. This instability means that although the Kerr metric is axis-symmetric, a black hole created through gravitational collapse may not be so.<ref name=\"visser35\" />  This instability also implies that many of the features of the Kerr geometry described above may not be present inside such a black hole.<ref name=\"pauldavies\" /><ref name=\"visser13\" />\n\nA surface on which light can orbit a black hole is called a photon sphere. The Kerr solution has infinitely many [[photon sphere]]s, lying between an inner one and an outer one. In the nonrotating, Schwarzschild solution, with ''a'' = 0, the inner and outer photon spheres degenerate, so that there is only one photon sphere at a single radius. The greater the spin of a black hole, the farther from each other the inner and outer photon spheres move. A beam of light traveling in a direction opposite to the spin of the black hole will circularly orbit the hole at the outer photon sphere. A beam of light traveling in the same direction as the black hole's spin will circularly orbit at the inner photon sphere. Orbiting geodesics with some angular momentum perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the black hole will orbit on photon spheres between these two extremes. Because the space-time is rotating, such orbits exhibit a precession, since there is a shift in the <math>\\phi \\,</math> variable after completing one period in the <math>\\theta \\,</math> variable.\n\n===Trajectory equations===\n[[File:Wiki-en-kerr-mini.gif|thumb|right|220px|link=File:Orbit_around_a_rotating_Kerr_black_hole.gif|Animation of a test-particle's orbit around a spinning black hole.

It retains the [[time translation]]s (one dimension) and rotations around its axis of rotation (one dimension). Thus it has two dimensions. Like the Poincar\u00e9 group, it has four connected components: the component of the identity; the component which reverses time and longitude; the component which reflects through the equatorial plane; and the component that does both.\n\nIn physics, symmetries are typically associated with conserved constants of motion, in accordance with [[Noether's theorem]]. As shown above, the geodesic equations have four conserved quantities: one of which comes from the definition of a geodesic, and two of which arise from the time translation and rotation symmetry of the Kerr geometry. The fourth conserved quantity does not arise from a symmetry in the standard sense and is commonly referred to as a hidden symmetry.\n\n==Overextreme Kerr solutions==\n\nThe location of the event horizon is determined by the larger root of <math>\\Delta=0</math>. When <math>{r_s / 2} < a </math> (i.e. <math>G M^2 < J c </math>), there are no (real valued) solutions to this equation, and there is no event horizon.

The larger of these roots determines the location of the event horizon, and the smaller determines the location of a Cauchy horizon. A (future-directed, time-like) curve can start in the exterior and pass through the event horizon.

The <math>r</math> coordinate again behaves like a spatial coordinate and can vary freely. The interior region has a reflection symmetry, so that a (future-directed time-like) curve may continue along a symmetric path, which continues through a second Cauchy horizon, through a second event horizon, and out into a new exterior region which is isometric to the original exterior region of the Kerr solution. The curve could then escape to infinity in the new region or enter the future event horizon of the new exterior region and repeat the process. This second exterior is sometimes thought of as another universe. On the other hand, in the Kerr solution, the singularity is a [[Ring singularity|ring]], and the curve may pass through the center of this ring. The region beyond permits closed time-like curves. Since the trajectory of observers and particles in general relativity are described by time-like curves, it is possible for observers in this region to return to their past.<ref name=\"pauldavies\">[[Paul Davies]]: [https://archive.is/20170708235257/https://books.google.at/books?id=mOgIGyD1uSIC&pg=PT291&lpg=PT291&dq=kerr+closed+loop+past&source=bl&ots=duxTYw68Fj&sig=2vWOrEFsA59UXxO6xFSQWwjtDGw&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjWhJzk6_rUAhXJZ1AKHaGxCI0Q6AEIWTAG%23v=onepage&q=kerr%20closed%20loop%20past&f=false About Time: Einstein's Unfinished Revolution]</ref><ref name=\"visser13\">{{cite arxiv |eprint=0706.0622v3 |at=p. 13, below eq. 52|author1=The LIGO Scientific Collaboration|title=The Kerr spacetime: A brief introduction|author2=the Virgo Collaboration|class=gr-qc|year=2007}}</ref> This interior solution is not likely to be physical and considered as a purely mathematical artefact.<ref name=\"kerrtube1\">Roy Kerr (Crafoord Prize Symposium in Astronomy): ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeLkmS3PZ5g&t=26m Spinning Black Holes]''.

The family of all stationary axially symmetric vacuum solutions to the Einstein field equation are the [[Ernst vacuum]]s.\n\nThe Kerr solution is also related to various non-vacuum solutions which model black holes. For example, the [[Kerr\u2013Newman metric|Kerr\u2013Newman electrovacuum]] models a (rotating) black hole endowed with an electric charge, while the [[Kerr\u2013Vaidya null dust]] models a (rotating) hole with infalling electromagnetic radiation.\n\nThe special case <math>a = 0 \\,</math> of the Kerr metric yields the [[Schwarzschild metric]], which models a ''nonrotating'' black hole which is [[static spacetime|static]] and [[spherically symmetric]], in the [[Schwarzschild coordinates]]. (In this case, every Geroch moment but the mass vanishes.)\n\nThe ''interior'' of the Kerr geometry, or rather a portion of it, is [[locally isometric]] to the [[Chandrasekhar\u2013Ferrari CPW vacuum]], an example of a [[colliding plane wave]] model. This is particularly interesting, because the [[global spacetime structure|global structure]] of this CPW solution is quite different from that of the Kerr geometry, and in principle, an experimenter could hope to study the geometry of (the outer portion of) the Kerr interior by arranging the collision of two suitable [[gravitational plane waves]].\n\n==Multipole moments==\nEach [[asymptotically flat]] Ernst vacuum can be characterized by giving the infinite sequence of relativistic [[multipole moment]]s, the first two of which can be interpreted as the [[mass]] and [[angular momentum]] of the source of the field. There are alternative formulations of relativistic multipole moments due to Hansen, Thorne, and Geroch, which turn out to agree with each other. The relativistic multipole moments of the Kerr geometry were computed by Hansen; they turn out to be\n:<math> M_n = M \\, \\left[i \\, a\\right]^n </math>\nThus, the special case of the [[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild vacuum]] (''a''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0) gives the \"monopole [[point source]]\" of general relativity.<ref group=lower-alpha>''Warning:'' Do not confuse the relativistic multipole moments computed by Hansen with the Weyl multipole moments discussed below.</ref>\n\n''Weyl multipole moments'' arise from treating a certain metric function (formally corresponding to Newtonian gravitational potential) which appears the Weyl-Papapetrou chart for the Ernst family of all stationary axisymmetric vacuum solutions using the standard euclidean scalar [[multipole moment]]s. They are distinct from the moments computed by Hansen, above. In a sense, the Weyl moments only (indirectly) characterize the \"mass distribution\" of an isolated source, and they turn out to depend only on the ''even order'' relativistic moments. In the case of solutions symmetric across the equatorial plane the ''odd order'' Weyl moments vanish. For the Kerr vacuum solutions, the first few Weyl moments are given by\n:<math>a_0 = M, \\qquad a_1 = 0, \\qquad a_2 = M \\, \\left( \\frac{M^2}{3} - a^2 \\right) </math>\nIn particular, we see that the Schwarzschild vacuum has nonzero second order Weyl moment, corresponding to the fact that the \"Weyl monopole\" is the [[Chazy\u2013Curzon vacuum]] solution, not the Schwarzschild vacuum solution, which arises from the Newtonian potential of a certain finite length uniform density thin ''rod''.\n\nIn weak field general relativity, it is convenient to treat isolated sources using another type of multipole, which generalize the Weyl moments to ''mass multipole moments'' and ''momentum multipole moments'', characterizing respectively the distribution of [[mass]] and of [[momentum]] of the source. These are multi-indexed quantities whose suitably symmetrized and anti-symmetrized parts can be related to the real and imaginary parts of the relativistic moments for the full nonlinear theory in a rather complicated manner.\n\nPerez and Moreschi have given an alternative notion of \"monopole solutions\" by expanding the standard NP tetrad of the Ernst vacuums in powers of ''r'' (the radial coordinate in the Weyl-Papapetrou chart). According to this formulation:\n* the isolated mass monopole source with ''zero'' angular momentum is the ''Schwarzschild vacuum'' family (one parameter),\n* the isolated mass monopole source with ''radial'' angular momentum is the ''[[Taub\u2013NUT vacuum]]'' family (two parameters; not quite asymptotically flat),\n* the isolated mass monopole source with ''axial'' angular momentum is the ''Kerr vacuum'' family (two parameters).\nIn this sense, the Kerr vacuums are the simplest stationary axisymmetric asymptotically flat vacuum solutions in general relativity.\n\n==Open problems==\n\nThe Kerr geometry is often used as a model of a [[rotating black hole]].  But if we hold the solution to be valid only outside some compact region (subject to certain restrictions), in principle we should be able to use it as an [[exterior solution]] to model the gravitational field around a rotating massive object other than a black hole, such as a [[neutron star]], or the Earth. This works out very nicely for the non-rotating case, where we can match the Schwarzschild vacuum exterior to a [[Schwarzschild fluid]] interior, and indeed to more general [[static spherically symmetric perfect fluid]] solutions. However, the problem of finding a rotating perfect-fluid interior which can be matched to a Kerr exterior, or indeed to any asymptotically flat vacuum exterior solution, has proven very difficult. In particular, the [[Wahlquist fluid]], which was once thought to be a candidate for matching to a Kerr exterior, is now known not to admit any such matching. At present it seems that only approximate solutions modeling slowly rotating fluid balls are known. (Slowly rotating fluid balls are the relativistic analog of oblate spheroidal balls with nonzero mass and angular momentum but vanishing higher multipole moments.)  However, the exterior of the [[Neugebauer\u2013Meinel disk]], an exact [[dust solution]] which models a rotating thin disk, approaches in a limiting case the <math> GM^2 = cJ </math> Kerr geometry. Physical thin-disk solutions obtained by identifying parts of the Kerr space-time are also known.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bi\u010d\u00e1k | first1 = J\u0159\u00ed | last2 = Ledvinka | first2 = Tom\u00e1\u0161 | year = 1993 | title = Relativistic disks as sources of the Kerr metric | url = | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 71 | issue = 11| pages = 1669\u20131672 | doi=10.1103/physrevlett.71.1669 | pmid=10054468| bibcode = 1993PhRvL..71.1669B }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Schwarzschild metric]]\n* [[Kerr\u2013Newman metric]]\n* [[Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m metric]]\n* [[Spin-flip]]\n* [[Kerr\u2013Schild spacetime]]\n* [[Rotating black hole]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist|1}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n===Further reading===\n*{{cite book | author=Wiltshire, David L.; Visser, Matt; & Scott, Susan M.

The Kerr [[metric tensor|metric]] is an [[Exact solutions in general relativity|exact solution]] of the [[Einstein field equations]] of [[general relativity]]; these equations are highly [[nonlinear system|non-linear]], which makes exact solutions very difficult to find.\n\n==Overview==\nThe Kerr metric is a generalization to a rotating body of the [[Schwarzschild metric]], discovered by [[Karl Schwarzschild]] in 1915, which described the geometry of [[spacetime]] around an uncharged, spherically-symmetric, and non-rotating body. The corresponding solution for a ''charged'', spherical, non-rotating body, the [[Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m metric]], was discovered soon afterwards (1916\u20131918). However, the exact solution for an uncharged, ''rotating'' black-hole, the Kerr metric, remained unsolved until 1963, when it was discovered by [[Roy Kerr]].<ref name=kerr_1963>{{cite journal |last=Kerr |first=Roy P. | authorlink=Roy Kerr | date=1963 | title=Gravitational Field of a Spinning Mass as an Example of Algebraically Special Metrics | journal=Physical Review Letters | volume=11 | issue=5 | pages=237\u2013238 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.11.237 | bibcode=1963PhRvL..11..237K }}</ref><ref name=melia2009>Melia, Fulvio (2009). \"Cracking the Einstein code: relativity and the birth of black hole physics, with an Afterword by Roy Kerr\", Princeton University Press, Princeton, {{ISBN|978-0226519517}}</ref>{{rp|69-81}} The natural extension to a charged, rotating black-hole, the [[Kerr\u2013Newman metric]], was discovered shortly thereafter in 1965. These four related solutions may be summarized by the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1.0em auto;\"\n! \n! Non-rotating (''J'' = 0)\n! Rotating (''J'' \u2260 0)\n|- \n!

The first measurement of this frame dragging effect was done in 2011 by the [[Gravity Probe B]] experiment. Roughly speaking, this effect predicts that objects coming close to a rotating mass will be entrained to participate in its rotation, not because of any applied force or torque that can be felt, but rather because of the swirling curvature of spacetime itself associated with rotating bodies. In the case of a rotating black hole, at close enough distances, all objects \u2013&nbsp;even light&nbsp;\u2013 ''must'' rotate with the black hole; the region where this holds is called the [[ergosphere]].\n\nRotating black holes have surfaces where the metric seems to have apparent [[coordinate singularity|singularities]]; the size and shape of these surfaces depends on the black hole's [[mass]] and [[angular momentum]]. The outer surface encloses the [[ergosphere]] and has a shape similar to a flattened sphere. The inner surface marks the [[event horizon]]; objects passing into the interior of this horizon can never again communicate with the world outside that horizon. However, neither surface is a true singularity, since their apparent singularity can be eliminated in a different [[coordinate system]]{{Citation needed|reason=first mention of alternate coordinate system, but without citation reader is unable to explore or verify this claim, very interested thanks|date=March 2019}}. Objects between these two surfaces must co-rotate with the rotating black hole, as noted above; this feature can in principle be used to extract energy from a rotating black hole, up to its [[invariant mass]] energy, ''Mc''<sup>2</sup>.\n\nThe LIGO experiment that first detected gravitational waves, announced in 2016, also provided the [[First observation of gravitational waves|first direct observation]] of a pair of Kerr black holes.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Abbot|first1=B.P.|title=Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=11 February 2016|volume=116|issue=6|pages=061102|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102|arxiv = 1602.03837 |bibcode = 2016PhRvL.116f1102A|pmid=26918975}}<!--|accessdate=24 February 2016--></ref>\n\n==Metric==\nThe Kerr metric is commonly expressed in one of two forms, the Boyer\u2013Lindquist form and the Kerr\u2013Schild form.

An \"ice skater\", in orbit over the equator and rotationally at rest with respect to the stars, extends her arms. The arm extended toward the black hole will be torqued spinward. The arm extended away from the black hole will be torqued anti-spinward. She will therefore be rotationally sped up, in a counter-rotating sense to the black hole. This is the opposite of what happens in everyday experience. If she is already rotating at a certain speed when she extends her arms, inertial effects and frame-dragging effects will balance and her spin will not change. Due to the [[Equivalence principle|Principle of Equivalence]] gravitational effects are locally indistinguishable from inertial effects, so this rotation rate, at which when she extends her arms nothing happens, is her local reference for non-rotation. This frame is rotating with respect to the fixed stars and counter-rotating with respect to the black hole. A useful metaphor is a [[planetary gear]] system with the black hole being the sun gear, the ice skater being a planetary gear and the outside universe being the ring gear. This can also be interpreted through [[Mach's principle]].\n\n==Important surfaces==\n[[File:Kerr-surfaces.png|thumb|Location of the horizons, ergospheres and the ring singularity of the Kerr spacetime in Cartesian Kerr-Schild coordinates.<ref name=\"visser35\">{{cite arxiv |eprint=0706.0622v3 |title=The Kerr spacetime: A brief introduction |at=p.&nbsp;15, Eq.&nbsp;60-61, p.&nbsp;24, p.&nbsp;35|last1=Visser |first1=Matt |year=2007 |class=gr-qc }}</ref>]]\n[[File:Kerr.black.hole.shadow.and.horizons.thumb.gif|220px|thumb|link=File:Kerr.black.hole.shadow.and.horizons.gif|Comparison of the shadow (black) and the important surfaces (white) of a black hole.

The inner surface corresponds to an [[event horizon]] similar to that observed in the [[Schwarzschild metric]]; this occurs where the purely radial component ''g''{{sub|rr}} of the metric goes to infinity. Solving the quadratic equation {{frac|1|''g''{{sub|''rr''}}}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 yields the solution:\n:<math>r_{\\rm H}^{\\pm} = \\frac{r_{s} \\pm \\sqrt{r_{s}^{2} - 4a^{2}\\,}}{2} \\ </math>\n\nwhich in natural units (that give ''G''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''M''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''c''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1) simplifies to:\n:<math> \\ r_{\\rm H}^{\\pm} = 1 \\pm \\sqrt{1-a^2\\,}</math>\n\nAnother apparent singularity occurs where the purely temporal component ''g''{{sub|tt}} of the metric changes sign from positive to negative. Again solving a quadratic equation ''g''{{sub|tt}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 yields the solution:\n:<math>r_{\\rm E}^{\\pm} = \\frac{r_{s} \\pm \\sqrt{r_{s}^{2} - 4a^{2} \\cos^{2}\\theta\\,}}{2} \\ </math>\n\nor in natural units:\n:<math> \\ r_{\\rm E}^{\\pm} = 1 \\pm \\sqrt{1-a^2 \\cos ^2\\theta \\,}</math>\n\nDue to the cos{{sup|2}}''\u03b8'' term in the square root, this outer surface resembles a flattened sphere that touches the inner surface at the poles of the rotation axis, where the colatitude ''\u03b8'' equals 0 or ''\u03c0''; the space between these two surfaces is called the [[ergosphere]]. Within this volume, the purely temporal component ''g''{{sub|tt}} is negative, i.e., acts like a purely spatial metric component. Consequently, particles within this ergosphere must co-rotate with the inner mass, if they are to retain their time-like character. A moving particle experiences a positive [[proper time]] along its [[worldline]], its path through [[spacetime]]. However, this is impossible within the ergosphere, where ''g''{{sub|tt}} is negative, unless the particle is co-rotating with the interior mass ''M'' with an angular speed at least of ''\u03a9''. Thus, no particle can rotate opposite to the central mass within the ergosphere.\n\nAs with the event horizon in the [[Schwarzschild metric]], the apparent singularities at ''r''{{sub|H}} and ''r''{{sub|E}} are illusions created by the choice of coordinates (i.e., they are  [[coordinate singularities]]). In fact, the space-time can be smoothly continued through them by an appropriate choice of coordinates.\n\n==Ergosphere and the Penrose process==\n{{main|Penrose process}}\n\nA black hole in general is surrounded by a surface, called the [[event horizon]] and situated at the [[Schwarzschild radius]] for a nonrotating black hole, where the escape velocity is equal to the velocity of light. Within this  surface, no observer/particle can maintain itself at a constant radius. It is forced to fall inwards, and so this is sometimes called the ''static limit''.\n<!--- [[File:Ergosphere.svg|thumb|right|250px|ergosphere of a rotating black hole|Two important surfaces around a rotating black hole. The inner sphere is the static limit (the event horizon). It is the inner boundary of a region called the [[ergoregion | ergosphere]]. The oblate spheroidal surface, touching the event horizon at the poles, is the outer boundary of the ergosphere. Within the ergosphere a particle is forced (dragging of space and time) to rotate and may gain energy at the cost of the rotational energy of the black hole ([[Penrose process]]).]]  -->\n\nA rotating black hole has the same static limit at its event horizon but there is an additional surface outside the event horizon named the \"ergosurface\" given by\n:<math>(r-M)^{2} = M^{2}-J^{2}\\cos^{2}\\theta</math>\n\nin [[Boyer\u2013Lindquist coordinates]], which can be intuitively characterized as the sphere where \"the rotational velocity of the surrounding space\" is dragged along with the velocity of light. Within this sphere the dragging is greater than the speed of light, and any observer/particle is forced to co-rotate.\n\nThe region outside the event horizon but inside the surface where the rotational velocity is the speed of light, is called the ''ergosphere'' (from Greek ''ergon'' meaning ''work''). Particles falling within the ergosphere are forced to rotate faster and thereby gain energy. Because they are still outside the event horizon, they may escape the black hole. The net process is that the rotating black hole emits energetic particles at the cost of its own total energy. The possibility of extracting spin energy from a rotating black hole was first proposed by the mathematician [[Roger Penrose]] in 1969 and is thus called the [[Penrose process]]. Rotating black holes in astrophysics are a potential source of large amounts of energy and are used to explain energetic phenomena, such as [[gamma-ray burst]]s.\n\n==Features of the Kerr geometry==\n\nThe Kerr geometry exhibits many noteworthy features: the maximal analytic extension includes a sequence of [[asymptotically flat]] exterior regions, each associated with an [[ergosphere]], stationary limit surfaces, [[event horizon]]s, [[Cauchy horizon]]s, [[closed timelike curve]]s, and a ring-shaped [[Gravitational singularity|curvature singularity]]. The [[geodesic equation]] can be solved exactly in closed form. In addition to two [[Killing vector fields]] (corresponding to ''[[time translation]]'' and ''axisymmetry''), the Kerr geometry admits a remarkable [[Killing tensor]]. There is a pair of principal null congruences (one ''ingoing'' and one ''outgoing''). The [[Weyl tensor]] is [[algebraically special]], in fact it has [[Petrov classification|Petrov type]] '''D'''. The [[global spacetime structure|global structure]] is known. Topologically, the  [[homotopy type]] of the Kerr spacetime can be simply characterized as a line with circles attached at each integer point.\n\nNote that the inner Kerr geometry is unstable with regard to perturbations in the interior region. This instability means that although the Kerr metric is axis-symmetric, a black hole created through gravitational collapse may not be so.<ref name=\"visser35\" />  This instability also implies that many of the features of the Kerr geometry described above may not be present inside such a black hole.<ref name=\"pauldavies\" /><ref name=\"visser13\" />\n\nA surface on which light can orbit a black hole is called a photon sphere. The Kerr solution has infinitely many [[photon sphere]]s, lying between an inner one and an outer one. In the nonrotating, Schwarzschild solution, with ''a'' = 0, the inner and outer photon spheres degenerate, so that there is only one photon sphere at a single radius. The greater the spin of a black hole, the farther from each other the inner and outer photon spheres move. A beam of light traveling in a direction opposite to the spin of the black hole will circularly orbit the hole at the outer photon sphere. A beam of light traveling in the same direction as the black hole's spin will circularly orbit at the inner photon sphere. Orbiting geodesics with some angular momentum perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the black hole will orbit on photon spheres between these two extremes. Because the space-time is rotating, such orbits exhibit a precession, since there is a shift in the <math>\\phi \\,</math> variable after completing one period in the <math>\\theta \\,</math> variable.\n\n===Trajectory equations===\n[[File:Wiki-en-kerr-mini.gif|thumb|right|220px|link=File:Orbit_around_a_rotating_Kerr_black_hole.gif|Animation of a test-particle's orbit around a spinning black hole.

It retains the [[time translation]]s (one dimension) and rotations around its axis of rotation (one dimension). Thus it has two dimensions. Like the Poincar\u00e9 group, it has four connected components: the component of the identity; the component which reverses time and longitude; the component which reflects through the equatorial plane; and the component that does both.\n\nIn physics, symmetries are typically associated with conserved constants of motion, in accordance with [[Noether's theorem]]. As shown above, the geodesic equations have four conserved quantities: one of which comes from the definition of a geodesic, and two of which arise from the time translation and rotation symmetry of the Kerr geometry. The fourth conserved quantity does not arise from a symmetry in the standard sense and is commonly referred to as a hidden symmetry.\n\n==Overextreme Kerr solutions==\n\nThe location of the event horizon is determined by the larger root of <math>\\Delta=0</math>. When <math>{r_s / 2} < a </math> (i.e. <math>G M^2 < J c </math>), there are no (real valued) solutions to this equation, and there is no event horizon.

The larger of these roots determines the location of the event horizon, and the smaller determines the location of a Cauchy horizon. A (future-directed, time-like) curve can start in the exterior and pass through the event horizon.

The <math>r</math> coordinate again behaves like a spatial coordinate and can vary freely. The interior region has a reflection symmetry, so that a (future-directed time-like) curve may continue along a symmetric path, which continues through a second Cauchy horizon, through a second event horizon, and out into a new exterior region which is isometric to the original exterior region of the Kerr solution. The curve could then escape to infinity in the new region or enter the future event horizon of the new exterior region and repeat the process. This second exterior is sometimes thought of as another universe. On the other hand, in the Kerr solution, the singularity is a [[Ring singularity|ring]], and the curve may pass through the center of this ring. The region beyond permits closed time-like curves. Since the trajectory of observers and particles in general relativity are described by time-like curves, it is possible for observers in this region to return to their past.<ref name=\"pauldavies\">[[Paul Davies]]: [https://archive.is/20170708235257/https://books.google.at/books?id=mOgIGyD1uSIC&pg=PT291&lpg=PT291&dq=kerr+closed+loop+past&source=bl&ots=duxTYw68Fj&sig=2vWOrEFsA59UXxO6xFSQWwjtDGw&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjWhJzk6_rUAhXJZ1AKHaGxCI0Q6AEIWTAG%23v=onepage&q=kerr%20closed%20loop%20past&f=false About Time: Einstein's Unfinished Revolution]</ref><ref name=\"visser13\">{{cite arxiv |eprint=0706.0622v3 |at=p. 13, below eq. 52|author1=The LIGO Scientific Collaboration|title=The Kerr spacetime: A brief introduction|author2=the Virgo Collaboration|class=gr-qc|year=2007}}</ref> This interior solution is not likely to be physical and considered as a purely mathematical artefact.<ref name=\"kerrtube1\">Roy Kerr (Crafoord Prize Symposium in Astronomy): ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeLkmS3PZ5g&t=26m Spinning Black Holes]''.

The family of all stationary axially symmetric vacuum solutions to the Einstein field equation are the [[Ernst vacuum]]s.\n\nThe Kerr solution is also related to various non-vacuum solutions which model black holes. For example, the [[Kerr\u2013Newman metric|Kerr\u2013Newman electrovacuum]] models a (rotating) black hole endowed with an electric charge, while the [[Kerr\u2013Vaidya null dust]] models a (rotating) hole with infalling electromagnetic radiation.\n\nThe special case <math>a = 0 \\,</math> of the Kerr metric yields the [[Schwarzschild metric]], which models a ''nonrotating'' black hole which is [[static spacetime|static]] and [[spherically symmetric]], in the [[Schwarzschild coordinates]]. (In this case, every Geroch moment but the mass vanishes.)\n\nThe ''interior'' of the Kerr geometry, or rather a portion of it, is [[locally isometric]] to the [[Chandrasekhar\u2013Ferrari CPW vacuum]], an example of a [[colliding plane wave]] model. This is particularly interesting, because the [[global spacetime structure|global structure]] of this CPW solution is quite different from that of the Kerr geometry, and in principle, an experimenter could hope to study the geometry of (the outer portion of) the Kerr interior by arranging the collision of two suitable [[gravitational plane waves]].\n\n==Multipole moments==\nEach [[asymptotically flat]] Ernst vacuum can be characterized by giving the infinite sequence of relativistic [[multipole moment]]s, the first two of which can be interpreted as the [[mass]] and [[angular momentum]] of the source of the field. There are alternative formulations of relativistic multipole moments due to Hansen, Thorne, and Geroch, which turn out to agree with each other. The relativistic multipole moments of the Kerr geometry were computed by Hansen; they turn out to be\n:<math> M_n = M \\, \\left[i \\, a\\right]^n </math>\nThus, the special case of the [[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild vacuum]] (''a''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0) gives the \"monopole [[point source]]\" of general relativity.<ref group=lower-alpha>''Warning:'' Do not confuse the relativistic multipole moments computed by Hansen with the Weyl multipole moments discussed below.</ref>\n\n''Weyl multipole moments'' arise from treating a certain metric function (formally corresponding to Newtonian gravitational potential) which appears the Weyl-Papapetrou chart for the Ernst family of all stationary axisymmetric vacuum solutions using the standard euclidean scalar [[multipole moment]]s. They are distinct from the moments computed by Hansen, above. In a sense, the Weyl moments only (indirectly) characterize the \"mass distribution\" of an isolated source, and they turn out to depend only on the ''even order'' relativistic moments. In the case of solutions symmetric across the equatorial plane the ''odd order'' Weyl moments vanish. For the Kerr vacuum solutions, the first few Weyl moments are given by\n:<math>a_0 = M, \\qquad a_1 = 0, \\qquad a_2 = M \\, \\left( \\frac{M^2}{3} - a^2 \\right) </math>\nIn particular, we see that the Schwarzschild vacuum has nonzero second order Weyl moment, corresponding to the fact that the \"Weyl monopole\" is the [[Chazy\u2013Curzon vacuum]] solution, not the Schwarzschild vacuum solution, which arises from the Newtonian potential of a certain finite length uniform density thin ''rod''.\n\nIn weak field general relativity, it is convenient to treat isolated sources using another type of multipole, which generalize the Weyl moments to ''mass multipole moments'' and ''momentum multipole moments'', characterizing respectively the distribution of [[mass]] and of [[momentum]] of the source. These are multi-indexed quantities whose suitably symmetrized and anti-symmetrized parts can be related to the real and imaginary parts of the relativistic moments for the full nonlinear theory in a rather complicated manner.\n\nPerez and Moreschi have given an alternative notion of \"monopole solutions\" by expanding the standard NP tetrad of the Ernst vacuums in powers of ''r'' (the radial coordinate in the Weyl-Papapetrou chart). According to this formulation:\n* the isolated mass monopole source with ''zero'' angular momentum is the ''Schwarzschild vacuum'' family (one parameter),\n* the isolated mass monopole source with ''radial'' angular momentum is the ''[[Taub\u2013NUT vacuum]]'' family (two parameters; not quite asymptotically flat),\n* the isolated mass monopole source with ''axial'' angular momentum is the ''Kerr vacuum'' family (two parameters).\nIn this sense, the Kerr vacuums are the simplest stationary axisymmetric asymptotically flat vacuum solutions in general relativity.\n\n==Open problems==\n\nThe Kerr geometry is often used as a model of a [[rotating black hole]].  But if we hold the solution to be valid only outside some compact region (subject to certain restrictions), in principle we should be able to use it as an [[exterior solution]] to model the gravitational field around a rotating massive object other than a black hole, such as a [[neutron star]], or the Earth. This works out very nicely for the non-rotating case, where we can match the Schwarzschild vacuum exterior to a [[Schwarzschild fluid]] interior, and indeed to more general [[static spherically symmetric perfect fluid]] solutions. However, the problem of finding a rotating perfect-fluid interior which can be matched to a Kerr exterior, or indeed to any asymptotically flat vacuum exterior solution, has proven very difficult. In particular, the [[Wahlquist fluid]], which was once thought to be a candidate for matching to a Kerr exterior, is now known not to admit any such matching. At present it seems that only approximate solutions modeling slowly rotating fluid balls are known. (Slowly rotating fluid balls are the relativistic analog of oblate spheroidal balls with nonzero mass and angular momentum but vanishing higher multipole moments.)  However, the exterior of the [[Neugebauer\u2013Meinel disk]], an exact [[dust solution]] which models a rotating thin disk, approaches in a limiting case the <math> GM^2 = cJ </math> Kerr geometry. Physical thin-disk solutions obtained by identifying parts of the Kerr space-time are also known.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bi\u010d\u00e1k | first1 = J\u0159\u00ed | last2 = Ledvinka | first2 = Tom\u00e1\u0161 | year = 1993 | title = Relativistic disks as sources of the Kerr metric | url = | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 71 | issue = 11| pages = 1669\u20131672 | doi=10.1103/physrevlett.71.1669 | pmid=10054468| bibcode = 1993PhRvL..71.1669B }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Schwarzschild metric]]\n* [[Kerr\u2013Newman metric]]\n* [[Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m metric]]\n* [[Spin-flip]]\n* [[Kerr\u2013Schild spacetime]]\n* [[Rotating black hole]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist|1}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n===Further reading===\n*{{cite book | author=Wiltshire, David L.; Visser, Matt; & Scott, Susan M.

In the 1867 [[Canadian Confederation]], three provinces of [[British North America]]\u2014[[New Brunswick]], [[Nova Scotia]], and the [[Province of Canada]] (which upon Confederation was divided into [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]])\u2014were united to form a federated colony, becoming a sovereign nation in the next century. Over its history, Canada's international borders have changed several times, and the country has grown from the original four provinces to the current ten provinces and three territories. Together, the provinces and territories make up the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|world's second-largest country]] by area.\n\nThe major difference between a Canadian province and a [[territory]] is that provinces receive their power and authority from the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'' (formerly<ref>Name changed only in Canada by <i>Canada Act, 1982</i> (UK), s. 1--see Talk</ref> called ''[[British North America Acts|The British North America Act, 1867]]''), whereas territorial governments have powers delegated to them by the [[Parliament of Canada]]. The powers flowing from the ''Constitution Act'' are divided between the [[Government of Canada]] (the federal government) and the provincial governments to exercise exclusively. A change to the division of powers between the federal government and the provinces requires a [[Amendments to the Constitution of Canada|constitutional amendment]], whereas a similar change affecting the territories can be performed unilaterally by the Parliament of Canada or government.\n\nIn modern [[Canadian federalism|Canadian constitutional theory]], the provinces are considered [[sovereignty|sovereign]] within certain areas based on the divisions of responsibility between the provincial and federal government within the ''Constitution Act 1867'', and each province thus has its own representative of the Canadian \"[[monarchy in the Canadian provinces|Crown]]\", the [[Lieutenant governor (Canada)|lieutenant governor]]. The territories are not sovereign, but instead their authorities and responsibilities come directly from the federal level, and as a result, have a commissioner instead of a lieutenant governor.\n__TOC__\n\n==Provinces==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! class=\"unsortable\" rowspan=\"2\" | Arms\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Province\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Canadian postal abbreviations for provinces and territories|Postal<br/>abbrev.]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Capital<br/><ref name=\"canada1\"/>\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Largest<br />city<ref>{{cite web |author=Place name |url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/prof/index.cfm?Lang=E |title=Census Profile |publisher=Statistic Canada |year=2013 |accessdate=August 6, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208074653/http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/prof/index.cfm?Lang=E |archive-date=February 8, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Entered<br />Confederation<ref name=\"(Canada)2004\">{{cite book|author=Reader's Digest Association (Canada)|author2=Canadian Geographic Enterprises|title=The Canadian Atlas: Our Nation, Environment and People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vDR7hrnO1aYC&pg=PP41|year=2004|publisher=Douglas & McIntyre|isbn=978-1-55365-082-9|page=41|accessdate=November 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503090030/https://books.google.com/books?id=vDR7hrnO1aYC&pg=PP41|archive-date=May 3, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Population<br/>{{efn|name=population| As of Q1 2020.<ref name=\"pop\">{{Cite web | url=https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1710000901 | title=Population estimates, quarterly | publisher=[[Statistics Canada]] |date=March 20, 2020 | accessdate=March 20, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190109220020/https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1710000901 | archive-date=January 9, 2019 | url-status=live}}</ref>}}\n! class=\"unsortable\" colspan=\"3\" | Area (km<sup>2</sup>)<ref name=StatsCan>{{cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/phys01-eng.htm|title=Land and freshwater area, by province and territory|publisher=Statistics Canada|year=2005|accessdate=August 4, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524063547/http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/phys01-eng.htm|archivedate=May 24, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Official<br />language(s)<ref>{{cite web |title=Official Language Policies of the Canadian Provinces |publisher=Fraser Institute |year=2012 |first1=Olivier |last1=Coche |first2=Fran\u00e7ois |last2=Vaillancourt |first3=Marc-Antoine |last3=Cadieux |first4=Jamie Lee |last4=Ronson |url=http://www.fraserinstitute.org/uploadedFiles/fraser-ca/Content/research-news/research/publications/official-language-policies-of-canadian-provinces.pdf |accessdate=August 6, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428174237/http://www.fraserinstitute.org/uploadedFiles/fraser-ca/Content/research-news/research/publications/official-language-policies-of-canadian-provinces.pdf |archivedate=April 28, 2012 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n! class=\"unsortable\" colspan=\"2\" | Seats<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/About/Parliament/GuideToHoC/index-e.htm |title=Guide to the Canadian House of Commons |publisher=Parliament of Canada |year=2012 |accessdate=August 6, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627214354/http://www.parl.gc.ca/About/Parliament/GuideToHoC/index-e.htm |archive-date=June 27, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n|-\n!

In the 1867 [[Canadian Confederation]], three provinces of [[British North America]]\u2014[[New Brunswick]], [[Nova Scotia]], and the [[Province of Canada]] (which upon Confederation was divided into [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]])\u2014were united to form a federated colony, becoming a sovereign nation in the next century. Over its history, Canada's international borders have changed several times, and the country has grown from the original four provinces to the current ten provinces and three territories. Together, the provinces and territories make up the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|world's second-largest country]] by area.\n\nThe major difference between a Canadian province and a [[territory]] is that provinces receive their power and authority from the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'' (formerly<ref>Name changed only in Canada by <i>Canada Act, 1982</i> (UK), s. 1--see Talk</ref> called ''[[British North America Acts|The British North America Act, 1867]]''), whereas territorial governments have powers delegated to them by the [[Parliament of Canada]]. The powers flowing from the ''Constitution Act'' are divided between the [[Government of Canada]] (the federal government) and the provincial governments to exercise exclusively. A change to the division of powers between the federal government and the provinces requires a [[Amendments to the Constitution of Canada|constitutional amendment]], whereas a similar change affecting the territories can be performed unilaterally by the Parliament of Canada or government.\n\nIn modern [[Canadian federalism|Canadian constitutional theory]], the provinces are considered [[sovereignty|sovereign]] within certain areas based on the divisions of responsibility between the provincial and federal government within the ''Constitution Act 1867'', and each province thus has its own representative of the Canadian \"[[monarchy in the Canadian provinces|Crown]]\", the [[Lieutenant governor (Canada)|lieutenant governor]]. The territories are not sovereign, but instead their authorities and responsibilities come directly from the federal level, and as a result, have a commissioner instead of a lieutenant governor.\n__TOC__\n\n==Provinces==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! class=\"unsortable\" rowspan=\"2\" | Arms\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Province\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Canadian postal abbreviations for provinces and territories|Postal<br/>abbrev.]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Capital<br/><ref name=\"canada1\"/>\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Largest<br />city<ref>{{cite web |author=Place name |url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/prof/index.cfm?Lang=E |title=Census Profile |publisher=Statistic Canada |year=2013 |accessdate=August 6, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208074653/http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/prof/index.cfm?Lang=E |archive-date=February 8, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Entered<br />Confederation<ref name=\"(Canada)2004\">{{cite book|author=Reader's Digest Association (Canada)|author2=Canadian Geographic Enterprises|title=The Canadian Atlas: Our Nation, Environment and People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vDR7hrnO1aYC&pg=PP41|year=2004|publisher=Douglas & McIntyre|isbn=978-1-55365-082-9|page=41|accessdate=November 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503090030/https://books.google.com/books?id=vDR7hrnO1aYC&pg=PP41|archive-date=May 3, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Population<br/>{{efn|name=population| As of Q1 2020.<ref name=\"pop\">{{Cite web | url=https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1710000901 | title=Population estimates, quarterly | publisher=[[Statistics Canada]] |date=March 20, 2020 | accessdate=March 20, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190109220020/https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1710000901 | archive-date=January 9, 2019 | url-status=live}}</ref>}}\n! class=\"unsortable\" colspan=\"3\" | Area (km<sup>2</sup>)<ref name=StatsCan>{{cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/phys01-eng.htm|title=Land and freshwater area, by province and territory|publisher=Statistics Canada|year=2005|accessdate=August 4, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524063547/http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/phys01-eng.htm|archivedate=May 24, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Official<br />language(s)<ref>{{cite web |title=Official Language Policies of the Canadian Provinces |publisher=Fraser Institute |year=2012 |first1=Olivier |last1=Coche |first2=Fran\u00e7ois |last2=Vaillancourt |first3=Marc-Antoine |last3=Cadieux |first4=Jamie Lee |last4=Ronson |url=http://www.fraserinstitute.org/uploadedFiles/fraser-ca/Content/research-news/research/publications/official-language-policies-of-canadian-provinces.pdf |accessdate=August 6, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428174237/http://www.fraserinstitute.org/uploadedFiles/fraser-ca/Content/research-news/research/publications/official-language-policies-of-canadian-provinces.pdf |archivedate=April 28, 2012 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n! class=\"unsortable\" colspan=\"2\" | Seats<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/About/Parliament/GuideToHoC/index-e.htm |title=Guide to the Canadian House of Commons |publisher=Parliament of Canada |year=2012 |accessdate=August 6, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627214354/http://www.parl.gc.ca/About/Parliament/GuideToHoC/index-e.htm |archive-date=June 27, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n|-\n!

Entrepreneurship is the process by which either an individual or a team identifies a business opportunity and acquires and deploys the necessary resources required for its exploitation. Early-19th-century French economist [[Jean-Baptiste Say]] provided a broad definition of entrepreneurship, saying that it \"shifts economic resources out of an area of lower and into an area of higher productivity and greater yield\". Entrepreneurs create something new, something different\u2014they change or transmute values.<ref>Drucker, P. F. (1993). ''Innovation and entrepreneurship: practice and principles''. New York: HarperBusiness.</ref> Regardless of the firm size, big or small, they can partake in entrepreneurship opportunities. The opportunity to become an entrepreneur requires four criteria. First, there must be opportunities or situations to recombine resources to generate profit. Second, entrepreneurship requires differences between people, such as preferential access to certain individuals or the ability to recognize information about opportunities. Third, taking on risk is a necessity. Fourth, the entrepreneurial process requires the organization of people and resources.<ref name=\"Shane\">Shane, S. A. (2003). ''A general theory of entrepreneurship: the individual-opportunity nexus''. Northampton, Massachusetts: E. Elgar.</ref>\n\nThe entrepreneur is a factor in and the study of entrepreneurship reaches back to the work of [[Richard Cantillon]] and [[Adam Smith]] in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. However, entrepreneurship was largely ignored theoretically until the late 19th and early 20th centuries and empirically until a profound resurgence in business and economics since the late 1970s. In the 20th century, the understanding of entrepreneurship owes much to the work of economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] in the 1930s and other Austrian economists such as [[Carl Menger]], [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich von Hayek]]. According to Schumpeter, an entrepreneur is a person who is willing and able to convert a new idea or invention into a successful [[innovation]]. Entrepreneurship employs what Schumpeter called \"the gale of creative destruction\" to replace in whole or in part inferior innovations across markets and industries, simultaneously creating new products including new business models. In this way, creative destruction is largely responsible for the dynamism of industries and long-run economic growth. The supposition that entrepreneurship leads to economic growth is an interpretation of the residual in endogenous growth theory and as such is hotly debated in academic economics. An alternative description posited by Israel Kirzner suggests that the majority of innovations may be much more incremental improvements such as the replacement of paper with plastic in the making of drinking straws.\n\nThe exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities may include:<ref>{{cite book|first=Robert D.|last=Hisrich|title=Entrepreneurship|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=s01P0agnLPUC}}|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-0-07062-017-9}}</ref>\n* Developing a [[business plan]]\n* Hiring the [[human resources]]\n* Acquiring financial and material resources\n* Providing leadership\n* Being responsible for both the venture's success or failure\n* [[Risk aversion]]\n\nEconomist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] (1883\u20131950) saw the role of the entrepreneur in the economy as \"[[creative destruction]]\" \u2013 launching innovations that simultaneously destroy old industries while ushering in new industries and approaches.

This institution was introduced in 1908 after a period of so-called freedom of trade (''Gewerbefreiheit'', introduced in 1871) in the [[German Reich]]. However, proof of competence was not required to start a business. In 1935 and in 1953, greater proof of competence was reintroduced (''Gro\u00dfer Bef\u00e4higungsnachweis Kuhlenbeck''), which required craftspeople to obtain a Meister apprentice-training certificate before being permitted to set up a new business.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1007/s00181-013-0773-7|title = Entry regulation and entrepreneurship: A natural experiment in German craftsmanship| journal=Empirical Economics| volume=47| issue=3| pages=1067\u20131101|year = 2013|last1 = Rostam-Afschar|first1 = Davud}}</ref>\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn the 20th century, entrepreneurship was studied by [[Joseph Schumpeter]] in the 1930s and other [[Austrian school|Austrian economists]] such as [[Carl Menger]], [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich von Hayek]]. While the loan from French of the word \"entrepreneur\" dates to the 1850, the term \"entrepreneurship\" was coined around the 1920s. According to Schumpeter, an entrepreneur is willing and able to convert a new idea or [[invention]] into a successful innovation.<ref name=\"Schumpeter1976\">{{cite book|first=Joseph Alois |last=Schumpeter|title=Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=6eM6YrMj46sC}}|year=1976|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-10762-4}}</ref> Entrepreneurship employs what Schumpeter called \"the gale of [[creative destruction]]\" to replace in whole or in part inferior offerings across markets and industries, simultaneously creating new products and new [[business model]]s, thus creative destruction is largely responsible for long-term [[economic growth]]. The idea that entrepreneurship leads to economic growth is an interpretation of the residual in [[endogenous growth theory]]{{clarify|date=October 2013}} and as such continues to be debated in academic economics. An alternative description by [[Israel Kirzner]] suggests that the majority of innovations may be incremental improvements such as the replacement of paper with plastic in the construction of a drinking straw that require no special qualities.\n\nFor Schumpeter, entrepreneurship resulted in new industries and in new combinations of currently existing inputs. Schumpeter's initial example of this was the combination of a steam engine and then current wagon making technologies to produce the horseless carriage. In this case, the innovation (i.e. the car) was transformational but did not require the development of dramatic new technology. It did not immediately replace the horse-drawn carriage, but in time incremental improvements reduced the cost and improved the technology, leading to the modern auto industry. Despite Schumpeter's early 20th-century contributions, the traditional [[microeconomic]] theory did not formally consider the entrepreneur in its theoretical frameworks (instead of assuming that resources would find each other through a price system). In this treatment, the entrepreneur was an implied but unspecified actor, consistent with the concept of the entrepreneur being the agent of [[x-efficiency]].\n\nFor Schumpeter, the entrepreneur did not bear risk: the capitalist did. Schumpeter believed that the equilibrium was imperfect. Schumpeter (1934) demonstrated that the changing environment continuously provides new information about the optimum allocation of resources to enhance profitability. Some individuals acquire the new information before others and recombine the resources to gain an entrepreneurial profit. Schumpeter was of the opinion that entrepreneurs shift the [[Production\u2013possibility frontier|production possibility curve]] to a higher level using innovations.<ref name=\"Schumpeter1934\">{{cite book|first=Joseph Alois |last=Schumpeter |authorlink=Joseph Schumpeter |title=The Theory of Economic Development: An Inquiry Into Profits, Capital, Credit, Interest, and the Business Cycle|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=-OZwWcOGeOwC}}|year=1934|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-87855-698-4}}</ref>\n\nInitially, economists made the first attempt to study the entrepreneurship concept in depth.<ref name=\"Landstrom2007\">{{cite book|first=H.|last=Landstrom|title=Pioneers in Entrepreneurship and Small Business Research|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=oSjccQt5zTsC}}|date=31 December 2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-23633-9}}</ref> Alfred Marshall viewed the entrepreneur as a multi-tasking capitalist and observed that in the equilibrium of a completely competitive market there was no spot for \"entrepreneurs\" as an economic activity creator.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Alfred|last1=Marshall|author1-link=Alfred Marshall|first2=C.

While most entrepreneurial ventures start out as a small business, not all small businesses are entrepreneurial in the strict sense of the term. Many small businesses are sole proprietor operations consisting solely of the owner\u2014or they have a small number of employees\u2014and many of these small businesses offer an existing product, process or service and they do not aim at growth. In contrast, entrepreneurial ventures offer an innovative product, process or service and the entrepreneur typically aims to scale up the company by adding employees, seeking international sales and so on, a process which is financed by [[venture capital]] and [[Angel investor|angel investment]]s. In this way, the term \"entrepreneur\" may be more closely associated with the term \"[[Startup company|startup]]\".

Journal of Business Venturing, 30(2), pp.185-204.</ref>,.<ref name=\"Lichtenstein, B. B. 2007\"/> Indeed, nascent entrepreneurs undertake numerous [[entrepreneurial]] activities, including actions that make their businesses more concrete to themselves and others. For instance, nascent entrepreneurs often look for and purchase facilities and equipment; seek and obtain financial backing, form [[legal entities]], organize teams; and dedicate all their time and energy to their business<ref>Carter, N.M., Gartner, W.B. and Reynolds, P.D., 1996. Exploring start-up event sequences. Journal of business venturing, 11(3), pp.151-166.</ref>\n\n=== Project-based ===\nProject entrepreneurs are individuals who are engaged in the repeated assembly or creation of temporary organizations.<ref name=\"Ferriani2009\">Ferriani, S., Cattani, G., C. Baden-Fuller (2009) \"The Relational Antecedents of Project-Entrepreneurship: Network Centrality, Team Composition, and Project Performance\", Research Policy, 2009, 38 (10): 1545\u20131558.[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByE7rCUuloTlM1NabFZra1RiUDg/edit?usp=sharing]</ref> These are organizations that have limited lifespans which are devoted to producing a singular objective or goal and get disbanded rapidly when the project ends. Industries where project-based enterprises are widespread include: [[sound recording]], [[film production]], [[software development]], television production, [[new media]] and construction.<ref name=\"Faulkner1987\">{{cite journal | last1 = Faulkner | first1 = R.

A project entrepreneur who used a certain approach and team for one project may have to modify the business model or team for a subsequent project.\n\nProject entrepreneurs are exposed repeatedly to problems and tasks typical of the entrepreneurial process.<ref name=\"DeFillippi2004\">DeFillippi, R., & Spring, S. 2004 Project entrepreneurs for project-based enterprises: Extension or complement to project management competencies? Projects and Profits, 4(2): 50-57.</ref> Indeed, project-entrepreneurs face two critical challenges that invariably characterize the creation of a new venture: locating the right opportunity to launch the project venture and assembling the most appropriate team to exploit that opportunity. Resolving the first challenge requires project-entrepreneurs to access an extensive range of information needed to seize new investment opportunities. Resolving the second challenge requires assembling a collaborative team that has to fit well with the particular challenges of the project and has to function almost immediately to reduce the risk that performance might be adversely affected. Another type of project entrepreneurship involves entrepreneurs working with business students to get analytical work done on their ideas.\n\n=== Millennial ===\nThe term \"millennial entrepreneur\" refers to a business owner who is affiliated with the generation that was brought up using digital technology and mass media\u2014the products of [[Baby Boomers]], those people born during the 1980s and early 1990s. Also known as [[Generation Y]], these business owners are well equipped with knowledge of new technology and new business models and have a strong grasp of its business applications. There have been many breakthrough businesses that have come from millennial entrepreneurs such as [[Mark Zuckerberg]], who created [[Facebook]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.inc.com/zoe-henry/the-richest-millennial-entrepreneurs-in-america.htm.html|title=The 10 Richest Millennial Entrepreneurs in America|date=December 12, 2016|work=Inc.com|access-date=June 6, 2017|language=en}}</ref> Despite the expectation of millennial success, there have been recent studies that have proven this to not be the case.  The comparison between millennials who are self-employed and those who are not self-employed shows that the latter is higher. The reason for this is because they have grown up in a different generation and attitude than their elders. Some of the barriers to entry for entrepreneurs are the economy, debt from schooling and the challenges of regulatory compliance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/advocacy/Millenial_IB.pdf|title=The Missing Millennial Entrepreneurs|last=Wilmouth|first=Daniel|website=U.S. Small Business Administration|access-date=June 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Entrepreneurial behaviors ==\nThe entrepreneur is commonly seen as an innovator\u2014a designer of new ideas and business processes.<ref>[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/entrepreneur.asp ''Investopedia'']; Investopedia.com; access date.</ref> Management skills and strong team building abilities are often perceived as essential leadership attributes for successful entrepreneurs.<ref name=\"Forbes\">{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tanyaprive/2012/12/19/top-10-qualities-that-make-a-great-leader | title=Top 10 Qualities That Make A Great Leader | first=Tanya | last=Prive | work=[[Forbes]] | date=19 December 2012 | accessdate=1 August 2013 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020062832/https://www.forbes.com/sites/tanyaprive/2012/12/19/top-10-qualities-that-make-a-great-leader | archivedate = 20 October 2017 | url-status = dead}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|certain=y|reason=Non-staff contributor article from Forbes.com.

The entrepreneur is willing to put his or her career and financial security on the line and take risks in the name of an idea, spending time as well as capital on an uncertain venture. However, entrepreneurs often do not believe that they have taken an enormous amount of risks because they do not perceive the level of uncertainty to be as high as other people do. Knight classified three types of uncertainty:\n* [[Risk]], which is measurable statistically (such as the probability of drawing a red color ball from a jar containing five red balls and five white balls)\n* [[Ambiguity]], which is hard to measure statistically (such as the probability of drawing a red ball from a jar containing five red balls but an unknown number of white balls)\n* [[Uncertainty|True uncertainty]] or Knightian uncertainty, which is impossible to estimate or predict statistically (such as the probability of drawing a red ball from a jar whose contents, in terms of numbers of coloured balls, are entirely unknown)\n\n[[File:Malala Yousafzai 2015.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Malala Yousafzai]], a Pakistani activist, social entrepreneur and youngest-ever [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner]]\nEntrepreneurship is often associated with true uncertainty, particularly when it involves the creation of a novel good or service, for a market that did not previously exist, rather than when a venture creates an incremental improvement to an existing product or service. A 2014 study at ETH Z\u00fcrich found that compared with typical managers, entrepreneurs showed higher decision-making efficiency and a stronger activation in regions of frontopolar cortex (FPC) previously associated with explorative choice.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Laureiro-Mart\u00ednez|first1=Daniella|last2=Canessa|first2=Nicola|last3=Brusoni|first3=Stefano|last4=Zollo|first4=Maurizio|last5=Hare|first5=Todd|last6=Alemanno|first6=Federica|last7=Cappa|first7=Stefano F.|title=Frontopolar cortex and decision-making efficiency: comparing brain activity of experts with different professional background during an exploration-exploitation task|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|date=22 January 2014|volume=7|page=927|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2013.00927|pmid=24478664|pmc=3897871}}</ref>\n\n=== \"Coachability\" and advice taking ===\nThe ability of entrepreneurs to work closely with and take advice from early investors and other partners (i.e. their coachability) has long been considered a critical factor in entrepreneurial success.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Timmons|first=Jeffry A.|last2=Bygrave|first2=William D.|title=Venture capital's role in financing innovation for economic growth|journal=Journal of Business Venturing|volume=1|issue=2|pages=161\u2013176|doi=10.1016/0883-9026(86)90012-1|year=1986}}</ref> At the same time, economists have argued that entrepreneurs should not simply act on all advice given to them, even when that advice comes from well-informed sources, because entrepreneurs possess far deeper and richer local knowledge about their own firm than any outsider. Indeed, measures of coachability are not actually predictive of entrepreneurial success (e.g. measured as success in subsequent funding rounds, acquisitions, pivots and firm survival). This research also shows that older and larger founding teams, presumably those with more subject expertise, are less coachable than younger and smaller founding teams.\n\n===Strategies===\nStrategies that entrepreneurs may use include:\n* [[Innovation]] of new products, services or processes<ref name=\":1\">{{cite news|last1=Qureshi|first1=Hamid|title=Decoding Right Strategies for Entrepreneurship|url=http://www.greaterkashmir.com/news/opinion/decoding-right-strategies-for-entrepreneurship/195820.html|accessdate=30 March 2016|work=Greater Kashmir|date=3 September 2015}}</ref>\n* Continuous process improvement (CPI)<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Exploration of new business models\n* Use of technology<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Use of [[business intelligence]]\n* Use of economical strategics\n* Development of future products and services<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Optimized talent management<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Designing individual/opportunity nexus ===\nAccording to Shane and Venkataraman, entrepreneurship comprises both \"enterprising individuals\" and \"entrepreneurial opportunities\", so researchers should study the nature of the individuals who identify opportunities when others do not, the opportunities themselves and the nexus between individuals and opportunities.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.5465/AMR.2000.2791611 | journal=Academy of Management Review | date=2000 | volume=25 | issue=1 | pages=217\u2013226 | first=S. | last=Shane| title=The Promise of Entrepreneurship as a Field of Research }}</ref> On the other hand, Reynolds et al.<ref>Reynolds PD, Hay M, Bygrave WD et al.

They found that the firms of distrusting entrepreneurs were more likely to survive than the firms of optimistic or overconfident entrepreneurs. The reasons were that distrusting entrepreneurs would emphasize failure-avoidance through sensible task selection and more analysis. Kets de Vries has pointed out that distrusting entrepreneurs are more alert about their external environment.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kets de Vries | first1 = M. | year = 2003 | title = The entrepreneur on the couch | url = | journal = INSEAD Quarterly | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 17\u201319 }}</ref> He concluded that distrusting entrepreneurs are less likely to discount negative events and are more likely to engage control mechanisms.

They determined that the best measures to identify a young entrepreneur are family and social status, parental role-modeling, entrepreneurial competencies at age 10, academic attainment at age 10, generalized self-efficacy, social skills, entrepreneurial intention and experience of unemployment.<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Schoon|first1= Ingrid|last2= Duckworth|first2= Kathryn|title= Who becomes an entrepreneur?

Through the proper use of strategic management/[[Strategic leadership|leadership]] techniques and the implementation of risk-bearing entrepreneurial thinking, the strategic entrepreneur is therefore able to align resources to create value and wealth.<ref name=\"Hitt, M.

J. (1991). The Parochial Dinosaur: The Organizational Sciences in Global Context. ''Academy of Management Review.''</ref> Words like \"leadership\" and \"entrepreneurship\" do not always translate well into other cultures and languages. For example, in North America a leader is often thought of as charismatic, but German culture frowns on such charisma due to the charisma of [[Nazi Party | Nazi]] leader [[Adolf Hitler]] (1889-1945). Other cultures, as in some European countries, view the term \"leader\" negatively, like the French.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last1 = \n | first1 = \n | author-link1 = \n | chapter = \n | editor1-last = Graumann\n | editor1-first = Carl F.\n | editor2-last = Moscovici\n | editor2-first = Serge\n | editor2-link = Serge Moscovici\n | title = Changing Conceptions of Leadership\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5lFDBAAAQBAJ\n | series = Springer Series in Social Psychology\n | location = New York\n | publisher = Springer Science & Business Media\n | publication-date = 2012\n | page = \n | isbn = 9781461248767\n | access-date = 2 March 2020\n | quote = \n}}\n</ref>{{qn|date=March 2020}}\nThe participative leadership style that is encouraged{{by whom?|date=March 2020}} in the United States is considered disrespectful in many other parts of the world due to the differences in power distance.<ref>Hofestede, G.

''Cultures and Organizations: Software of the Mind.''</ref> Many Asian and Middle Eastern countries do not have \"open door\" policies for subordinates, who would never informally approach their managers/bosses. For countries like that, an [[authoritarian]] approach to management and leadership is more customary.\n\nDespite cultural differences, the successes and failures of entrepreneurs can be traced to how leaders adapt to local conditions.<ref>Hofstede, G.

Their study focused on two education levels, college degree and post-graduate degree. While Michelacci and Schivardi do not specifically determine characteristics or traits for successful entrepreneurs, they do believe that there is a direct relationship between education and success, noting that having a college knowledge does contribute to advancement in the workforce.\n\nMichelacci and Schivardi state there has been a rise in the number of self-employed people with a baccalaureate degree. However, their findings also show that those who are self-employed and possess a graduate degree has remained consistent throughout time at about 33 percent. They briefly mention those famous entrepreneurs like [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Mark Zuckerberg]] who were college dropouts, but they call these cases all but exceptional as it is a pattern that many entrepreneurs view formal education as costly, mainly because of the [[Opportunity cost|time that needs to be spent on it]]. Michelacci and Schivardi believe that in order for an individual to reach the full success they need to have education beyond high school. Their research shows that the higher the education level the greater the success. The reason is that college gives people additional skills that can be used within their business and to operate on a higher level than someone who only \"runs\" it.\n\n== Resources and financing ==\n\n=== Entrepreneurial resources ===\nAn entrepreneurial resource is any company-owned [[asset]] that has [[economic value]] creating capabilities. Economic value creating both tangible and intangible sources are considered as entrepreneurial resources. Their economic value is generating activities or services through mobilization by entrepreneurs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Organizing Entrepreneurship|author1=Anna Grandori |author2=Laura Gaillard Giordani |publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=978-0-415-57037-4|location=|pages=}}</ref> Entrepreneurial resources can be divided into two fundamental categories: tangible and intangible resources.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Strategic Management Theory: An Integrated Approach|author1=Charles W.

On the contrary, intangible resources are nonphysical or more challenging to identify and evaluate, and they possess more value creating capacity such as human resources including skills and experience in a particular field, organizational structure of the company, brand name, reputation, entrepreneurial networks that contribute to promotion and financial support, [[know-how]], [[intellectual property]] including both [[copyright]]s, [[trademark]]s and [[patent]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Understanding Business Strategy: Concepts and Cases (Strategic Management)|author1=R.

One of the reasons that some entrepreneurs prefer to \"bootstrap\" is that obtaining [[equity financing]] requires the entrepreneur to provide ownership shares to the investors. If the start-up becomes successful later on, these early equity financing deals could provide a windfall for the investors and a huge loss for the entrepreneur. If investors have a significant stake in the company, they may as well be able to exert influence on company strategy, [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) choice and other important decisions. This is often problematic since the investor and the founder might have different incentives regarding the long-term goal of the company. An investor will generally aim for a profitable exit and therefore promotes a high-valuation sale of the company or IPO to sell their shares. Whereas the entrepreneur might have philanthropic intentions as their main driving force. Soft values like this might not go well with the short-term pressure on yearly and quarterly profits that publicly traded companies often experience from their owners.\n\nOne consensus definition of bootstrapping sees it as \"a collection of methods used to minimize the amount of outside debt and equity financing needed from banks and investors\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ebbena|first1=Jay|last2=Johnson|first2=Alec|title=Bootstrapping in small firms: An empirical analysis of change over time|journal=Journal of Business Venturing|publicationdate=November 2006|volume=21|issue=6|pages=851\u2013865|doi=10.1016/j.jbusvent.2005.06.007|quote=Bootstrapping has taken on many definitions in the literature, but there has been some recent consensus that it is a collection of methods used to minimize the amount of outside debt and equity financing needed from banks and investors (Winborg and Landstrom, 2001 and Harrison and Mason, 1997).|year=2006}}</ref> The majority of businesses require less than $10,000 to launch,{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} which means that personal savings are most often used to start.

Entrepreneurship is the process by which either an individual or a team identifies a business opportunity and acquires and deploys the necessary resources required for its exploitation. Early-19th-century French economist [[Jean-Baptiste Say]] provided a broad definition of entrepreneurship, saying that it \"shifts economic resources out of an area of lower and into an area of higher productivity and greater yield\". Entrepreneurs create something new, something different\u2014they change or transmute values.<ref>Drucker, P. F. (1993). ''Innovation and entrepreneurship: practice and principles''. New York: HarperBusiness.</ref> Regardless of the firm size, big or small, they can partake in entrepreneurship opportunities. The opportunity to become an entrepreneur requires four criteria. First, there must be opportunities or situations to recombine resources to generate profit. Second, entrepreneurship requires differences between people, such as preferential access to certain individuals or the ability to recognize information about opportunities. Third, taking on risk is a necessity. Fourth, the entrepreneurial process requires the organization of people and resources.<ref name=\"Shane\">Shane, S. A. (2003). ''A general theory of entrepreneurship: the individual-opportunity nexus''. Northampton, Massachusetts: E. Elgar.</ref>\n\nThe entrepreneur is a factor in and the study of entrepreneurship reaches back to the work of [[Richard Cantillon]] and [[Adam Smith]] in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. However, entrepreneurship was largely ignored theoretically until the late 19th and early 20th centuries and empirically until a profound resurgence in business and economics since the late 1970s. In the 20th century, the understanding of entrepreneurship owes much to the work of economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] in the 1930s and other Austrian economists such as [[Carl Menger]], [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich von Hayek]]. According to Schumpeter, an entrepreneur is a person who is willing and able to convert a new idea or invention into a successful [[innovation]]. Entrepreneurship employs what Schumpeter called \"the gale of creative destruction\" to replace in whole or in part inferior innovations across markets and industries, simultaneously creating new products including new business models. In this way, creative destruction is largely responsible for the dynamism of industries and long-run economic growth. The supposition that entrepreneurship leads to economic growth is an interpretation of the residual in endogenous growth theory and as such is hotly debated in academic economics. An alternative description posited by Israel Kirzner suggests that the majority of innovations may be much more incremental improvements such as the replacement of paper with plastic in the making of drinking straws.\n\nThe exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities may include:<ref>{{cite book|first=Robert D.|last=Hisrich|title=Entrepreneurship|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=s01P0agnLPUC}}|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-0-07062-017-9}}</ref>\n* Developing a [[business plan]]\n* Hiring the [[human resources]]\n* Acquiring financial and material resources\n* Providing leadership\n* Being responsible for both the venture's success or failure\n* [[Risk aversion]]\n\nEconomist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] (1883\u20131950) saw the role of the entrepreneur in the economy as \"[[creative destruction]]\" \u2013 launching innovations that simultaneously destroy old industries while ushering in new industries and approaches.

An alternative description by [[Israel Kirzner]] suggests that the majority of innovations may be incremental improvements such as the replacement of paper with plastic in the construction of a drinking straw that require no special qualities.\n\nFor Schumpeter, entrepreneurship resulted in new industries and in new combinations of currently existing inputs. Schumpeter's initial example of this was the combination of a steam engine and then current wagon making technologies to produce the horseless carriage. In this case, the innovation (i.e. the car) was transformational but did not require the development of dramatic new technology. It did not immediately replace the horse-drawn carriage, but in time incremental improvements reduced the cost and improved the technology, leading to the modern auto industry. Despite Schumpeter's early 20th-century contributions, the traditional [[microeconomic]] theory did not formally consider the entrepreneur in its theoretical frameworks (instead of assuming that resources would find each other through a price system). In this treatment, the entrepreneur was an implied but unspecified actor, consistent with the concept of the entrepreneur being the agent of [[x-efficiency]].\n\nFor Schumpeter, the entrepreneur did not bear risk: the capitalist did. Schumpeter believed that the equilibrium was imperfect. Schumpeter (1934) demonstrated that the changing environment continuously provides new information about the optimum allocation of resources to enhance profitability. Some individuals acquire the new information before others and recombine the resources to gain an entrepreneurial profit. Schumpeter was of the opinion that entrepreneurs shift the [[Production\u2013possibility frontier|production possibility curve]] to a higher level using innovations.<ref name=\"Schumpeter1934\">{{cite book|first=Joseph Alois |last=Schumpeter |authorlink=Joseph Schumpeter |title=The Theory of Economic Development: An Inquiry Into Profits, Capital, Credit, Interest, and the Business Cycle|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=-OZwWcOGeOwC}}|year=1934|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-87855-698-4}}</ref>\n\nInitially, economists made the first attempt to study the entrepreneurship concept in depth.<ref name=\"Landstrom2007\">{{cite book|first=H.|last=Landstrom|title=Pioneers in Entrepreneurship and Small Business Research|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=oSjccQt5zTsC}}|date=31 December 2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-23633-9}}</ref> Alfred Marshall viewed the entrepreneur as a multi-tasking capitalist and observed that in the equilibrium of a completely competitive market there was no spot for \"entrepreneurs\" as an economic activity creator.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Alfred|last1=Marshall|author1-link=Alfred Marshall|first2=C.

While most entrepreneurial ventures start out as a small business, not all small businesses are entrepreneurial in the strict sense of the term. Many small businesses are sole proprietor operations consisting solely of the owner\u2014or they have a small number of employees\u2014and many of these small businesses offer an existing product, process or service and they do not aim at growth. In contrast, entrepreneurial ventures offer an innovative product, process or service and the entrepreneur typically aims to scale up the company by adding employees, seeking international sales and so on, a process which is financed by [[venture capital]] and [[Angel investor|angel investment]]s. In this way, the term \"entrepreneur\" may be more closely associated with the term \"[[Startup company|startup]]\". Successful entrepreneurs have the ability to lead a business in a positive direction by proper planning, to adapt to changing environments and understand their own strengths and weakness.<ref>{{cite  web|url=http://www.ondernemerstest.nl/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/ICSBv5.pdf|first1=Martyn P. |last1=Driessen |first2=Peter S. |last2=Zwart|title=The role of the entrepreneur in small business success: the  Entrepreneurship Scan|year= 2010 }}</ref>\n\n=== Historians' ranking===\nA 2002 survey of 58 business history professors gave the top spots in American business history to  [[Henry Ford]], followed by [[Bill Gates]]; [[John D.

A long tradition of academic research explores the experiences and strategies of ethnic entrepreneurs as they strive to integrate economically into mainstream U.S. or European society. Classic cases include Jewish merchants and tradespeople in large U.S. cities in the 19th and early 20th centuries as well as Chinese and Japanese small business owners (restaurants, farmers, shop owners) on the West Coast.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Out Of Print : Ethnic Enterprise in America: Business and Welfare Among Chinese, Japanese, and Blacks : Ivan Light - University of California Press|url = http://www.ucpress.edu/op.php?isbn=9780520024854|website = www.ucpress.edu|access-date = 2016-01-16|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161020162025/http://www.ucpress.edu/op.php?isbn=9780520024854|archivedate = 2016-10-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the 2010s, ethnic entrepreneurship has been studied in the case of Cuban business owners in Miami, Indian motel owners of the U.S. and Chinese business owners in [[Chinatown]]s across the United States.

In their book ''[https://www.ubcpress.ca/the-business-of-culture The Business of Culture]'' (2015), Rea and Volland identify three types of cultural entrepreneur: \"cultural personalities\", defined as \"individuals who buil[d] their own personal brand of creativity as a cultural authority and leverage it to create and sustain various cultural enterprises\"; \"tycoons\", defined as \"entrepreneurs who buil[d] substantial clout in the cultural sphere by forging synergies between their industrial, cultural, political, and philanthropic interests\"; and \"collective enterprises\", organizations which may engage in cultural production for profit or not-for-profit purposes.<ref>Christopher Rea and Nicolai Volland, \"The Business of Culture\" (UBC Press, 2015), pp. 4-7.

Such research will help separate entrepreneurial action into its basic sub-activities and elucidate the inter- relationships between activities, between an activity (or sequence of activities) and an individual's motivation to form an opportunity belief, and between an activity (or sequence of activities) and the knowledge needed to form an opportunity belief. With this research, scholars will be able to begin constructing a theory of the micro-foundations of entrepreneurial action.\n\nScholars interested in nascent entrepreneurship tend to focus less on the single act of opportunity exploitation and more on the series of actions in new venture emergence,<ref name=\"Delmar, F 2004\"/><ref>Kim, P.H., Longest, K.C. and Lippmann, S., 2015.

For instance, nascent entrepreneurs often look for and purchase facilities and equipment; seek and obtain financial backing, form [[legal entities]], organize teams; and dedicate all their time and energy to their business<ref>Carter, N.M., Gartner, W.B. and Reynolds, P.D., 1996.

Journal of business venturing, 11(3), pp.151-166.</ref>\n\n=== Project-based ===\nProject entrepreneurs are individuals who are engaged in the repeated assembly or creation of temporary organizations.<ref name=\"Ferriani2009\">Ferriani, S., Cattani, G., C. Baden-Fuller (2009) \"The Relational Antecedents of Project-Entrepreneurship: Network Centrality, Team Composition, and Project Performance\", Research Policy, 2009, 38 (10): 1545\u20131558.[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByE7rCUuloTlM1NabFZra1RiUDg/edit?usp=sharing]</ref> These are organizations that have limited lifespans which are devoted to producing a singular objective or goal and get disbanded rapidly when the project ends.

A project entrepreneur who used a certain approach and team for one project may have to modify the business model or team for a subsequent project.\n\nProject entrepreneurs are exposed repeatedly to problems and tasks typical of the entrepreneurial process.<ref name=\"DeFillippi2004\">DeFillippi, R., & Spring, S. 2004 Project entrepreneurs for project-based enterprises: Extension or complement to project management competencies? Projects and Profits, 4(2): 50-57.</ref> Indeed, project-entrepreneurs face two critical challenges that invariably characterize the creation of a new venture: locating the right opportunity to launch the project venture and assembling the most appropriate team to exploit that opportunity. Resolving the first challenge requires project-entrepreneurs to access an extensive range of information needed to seize new investment opportunities. Resolving the second challenge requires assembling a collaborative team that has to fit well with the particular challenges of the project and has to function almost immediately to reduce the risk that performance might be adversely affected. Another type of project entrepreneurship involves entrepreneurs working with business students to get analytical work done on their ideas.\n\n=== Millennial ===\nThe term \"millennial entrepreneur\" refers to a business owner who is affiliated with the generation that was brought up using digital technology and mass media\u2014the products of [[Baby Boomers]], those people born during the 1980s and early 1990s. Also known as [[Generation Y]], these business owners are well equipped with knowledge of new technology and new business models and have a strong grasp of its business applications. There have been many breakthrough businesses that have come from millennial entrepreneurs such as [[Mark Zuckerberg]], who created [[Facebook]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.inc.com/zoe-henry/the-richest-millennial-entrepreneurs-in-america.htm.html|title=The 10 Richest Millennial Entrepreneurs in America|date=December 12, 2016|work=Inc.com|access-date=June 6, 2017|language=en}}</ref> Despite the expectation of millennial success, there have been recent studies that have proven this to not be the case.  The comparison between millennials who are self-employed and those who are not self-employed shows that the latter is higher.

The entrepreneur is willing to put his or her career and financial security on the line and take risks in the name of an idea, spending time as well as capital on an uncertain venture. However, entrepreneurs often do not believe that they have taken an enormous amount of risks because they do not perceive the level of uncertainty to be as high as other people do. Knight classified three types of uncertainty:\n* [[Risk]], which is measurable statistically (such as the probability of drawing a red color ball from a jar containing five red balls and five white balls)\n* [[Ambiguity]], which is hard to measure statistically (such as the probability of drawing a red ball from a jar containing five red balls but an unknown number of white balls)\n* [[Uncertainty|True uncertainty]] or Knightian uncertainty, which is impossible to estimate or predict statistically (such as the probability of drawing a red ball from a jar whose contents, in terms of numbers of coloured balls, are entirely unknown)\n\n[[File:Malala Yousafzai 2015.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Malala Yousafzai]], a Pakistani activist, social entrepreneur and youngest-ever [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner]]\nEntrepreneurship is often associated with true uncertainty, particularly when it involves the creation of a novel good or service, for a market that did not previously exist, rather than when a venture creates an incremental improvement to an existing product or service. A 2014 study at ETH Z\u00fcrich found that compared with typical managers, entrepreneurs showed higher decision-making efficiency and a stronger activation in regions of frontopolar cortex (FPC) previously associated with explorative choice.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Laureiro-Mart\u00ednez|first1=Daniella|last2=Canessa|first2=Nicola|last3=Brusoni|first3=Stefano|last4=Zollo|first4=Maurizio|last5=Hare|first5=Todd|last6=Alemanno|first6=Federica|last7=Cappa|first7=Stefano F.|title=Frontopolar cortex and decision-making efficiency: comparing brain activity of experts with different professional background during an exploration-exploitation task|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|date=22 January 2014|volume=7|page=927|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2013.00927|pmid=24478664|pmc=3897871}}</ref>\n\n=== \"Coachability\" and advice taking ===\nThe ability of entrepreneurs to work closely with and take advice from early investors and other partners (i.e. their coachability) has long been considered a critical factor in entrepreneurial success.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Timmons|first=Jeffry A.|last2=Bygrave|first2=William D.|title=Venture capital's role in financing innovation for economic growth|journal=Journal of Business Venturing|volume=1|issue=2|pages=161\u2013176|doi=10.1016/0883-9026(86)90012-1|year=1986}}</ref> At the same time, economists have argued that entrepreneurs should not simply act on all advice given to them, even when that advice comes from well-informed sources, because entrepreneurs possess far deeper and richer local knowledge about their own firm than any outsider. Indeed, measures of coachability are not actually predictive of entrepreneurial success (e.g. measured as success in subsequent funding rounds, acquisitions, pivots and firm survival).

Their study focused on two education levels, college degree and post-graduate degree. While Michelacci and Schivardi do not specifically determine characteristics or traits for successful entrepreneurs, they do believe that there is a direct relationship between education and success, noting that having a college knowledge does contribute to advancement in the workforce.\n\nMichelacci and Schivardi state there has been a rise in the number of self-employed people with a baccalaureate degree. However, their findings also show that those who are self-employed and possess a graduate degree has remained consistent throughout time at about 33 percent. They briefly mention those famous entrepreneurs like [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Mark Zuckerberg]] who were college dropouts, but they call these cases all but exceptional as it is a pattern that many entrepreneurs view formal education as costly, mainly because of the [[Opportunity cost|time that needs to be spent on it]]. Michelacci and Schivardi believe that in order for an individual to reach the full success they need to have education beyond high school. Their research shows that the higher the education level the greater the success. The reason is that college gives people additional skills that can be used within their business and to operate on a higher level than someone who only \"runs\" it.\n\n== Resources and financing ==\n\n=== Entrepreneurial resources ===\nAn entrepreneurial resource is any company-owned [[asset]] that has [[economic value]] creating capabilities.

One of the reasons that some entrepreneurs prefer to \"bootstrap\" is that obtaining [[equity financing]] requires the entrepreneur to provide ownership shares to the investors. If the start-up becomes successful later on, these early equity financing deals could provide a windfall for the investors and a huge loss for the entrepreneur. If investors have a significant stake in the company, they may as well be able to exert influence on company strategy, [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) choice and other important decisions. This is often problematic since the investor and the founder might have different incentives regarding the long-term goal of the company. An investor will generally aim for a profitable exit and therefore promotes a high-valuation sale of the company or IPO to sell their shares. Whereas the entrepreneur might have philanthropic intentions as their main driving force. Soft values like this might not go well with the short-term pressure on yearly and quarterly profits that publicly traded companies often experience from their owners.\n\nOne consensus definition of bootstrapping sees it as \"a collection of methods used to minimize the amount of outside debt and equity financing needed from banks and investors\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ebbena|first1=Jay|last2=Johnson|first2=Alec|title=Bootstrapping in small firms: An empirical analysis of change over time|journal=Journal of Business Venturing|publicationdate=November 2006|volume=21|issue=6|pages=851\u2013865|doi=10.1016/j.jbusvent.2005.06.007|quote=Bootstrapping has taken on many definitions in the literature, but there has been some recent consensus that it is a collection of methods used to minimize the amount of outside debt and equity financing needed from banks and investors (Winborg and Landstrom, 2001 and Harrison and Mason, 1997).|year=2006}}</ref> The majority of businesses require less than $10,000 to launch,{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} which means that personal savings are most often used to start.

Values for cardiac output are usually denoted as L/min. For a healthy person weighing 70&nbsp;kg, the cardiac output at rest averages about 5 L/min; assuming a heart rate of 70 beats/min, the stroke volume would be approximately 70 ml.\n\nBecause cardiac output is related to the quantity of blood delivered to various parts of the body, it is an important component of how efficiently the heart can meet the body's demands for the maintenance of adequate tissue [[perfusion]]. Body tissues require continuous oxygen delivery which requires the sustained transport of oxygen to the tissues by the systemic circulation of oxygenated blood at an adequate pressure from the left ventricle of the heart via the aorta and arteries. Oxygen delivery (DO<sub>2</sub> mls/min) is the resultant of blood flow (cardiac output CO) times the blood oxygen content (CaO<sub>2</sub>). Mathematically this is calculated as follows: Oxygen delivery = cardiac output \u00d7 arterial oxygen content DO<sub>2</sub> = CO \u00d7 CaO<sub>2</sub>.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dunn|first=J.-Oc|last2=Mythen|first2=M.

The amount/percentage of the circulated oxygen consumed (VO<sub>2</sub>) per minute through metabolism varies depending on the activity level but at rest is circa 25% of the DO<sub>2</sub>.  Physical exercise requires a higher than resting-level of oxygen consumption to support increased muscle activity. In the case of [[heart failure]], actual CO may be insufficient to support even simple activities of daily living; nor can it increase sufficiently to meet the higher metabolic demands stemming from even moderate exercise.\n\nCardiac output is a global blood flow parameter of interest in [[hemodynamics|h\u00e6modynamics]], the study of the flow of blood. The factors affecting stroke volume and heart rate also affect cardiac output. The figure at the right margin illustrates this dependency and lists some of these factors. A detailed hierarchical illustration is provided in [[#2036SummaryOfFactorsInCardiacOutput|a subsequent figure]].\n\nThere are many methods of measuring CO, both invasively and non-invasively; each has advantages and drawbacks as described below.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Definition==\nThe function of the heart is to drive blood through the [[circulatory system]] in a cycle that delivers oxygen, nutrients and chemicals to the body's cells and removes cellular waste. Because it pumps out whatever blood comes back into it from the [[venous system]], the quantity of blood returning to the heart effectively determines the quantity of blood the heart pumps out \u2013 its cardiac output, ''Q''. Cardiac output is classically defined alongside [[stroke volume]] (SV) and the [[heart rate]] (HR) as:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>CO_{[L/min]} = SV_{[L/beat]} \\times HR_{[beats/min]}</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\nIn standardizing what CO values are considered to be within normal range independent of the size of the subject's body, the accepted convention is to further index equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) using [[Body surface area]] (BSA), giving rise to the [[Cardiac index]] (CI). This is detailed in equation ({{EquationNote|2}}) below.\n\n== Measurement ==\nThere are a number of clinical methods to measure cardiac output, ranging from direct intracardiac catheterization to non-invasive measurement of the arterial pulse. Each method has advantages and drawbacks. Relative comparison is limited by the absence of a widely accepted \"gold standard\" measurement. Cardiac output can also be affected significantly by the phase of respiration \u2013 intra-thoracic pressure changes influence diastolic filling and therefore cardiac output.

However, any measure from the artery includes changes in pressure associated with changes in arterial function, for example compliance and impedance. Physiological or therapeutic changes in vessel diameter are assumed to reflect changes in ''Q''. PP methods measure the combined performance of the heart and the blood vessels, thus limiting their application for measurement of ''Q''. This can be partially compensated for by intermittent calibration of the waveform to another ''Q'' measurement method then monitoring the PP waveform. Ideally, the PP waveform should be calibrated on a beat-to-beat basis. There are invasive and non-invasive methods of measuring PP.\n\n==== Finapres methodology ====\n\nIn 1967, the Czech physiologist Jan Pe\u0148\u00e1z invented and patented the [[Continuous noninvasive arterial pressure|volume clamp method]] of measuring continuous blood pressure. The principle of the volume clamp method is to dynamically provide equal pressures, on either side of an artery wall. By clamping the artery to a certain volume, inside pressure\u2014intra-arterial pressure\u2014balances outside pressure\u2014finger cuff pressure. Pe\u00f1\u00e1z decided the finger was the optimal site to apply this volume clamp method. The use of finger cuffs excludes the device from application in patients without vasoconstriction, such as in sepsis or in patients on vasopressors.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIn 1978, scientists at BMI-TNO, the research unit of [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research]] at the [[University of Amsterdam]], invented and patented a series of additional key elements that make the volume clamp work in clinical practice. These methods include the use of modulated infrared light in the optical system inside the sensor, the lightweight, easy-to-wrap finger cuff with [[velcro]] fixation, a new pneumatic proportional control valve principle, and a set point strategy for the determining and tracking the correct volume at which to clamp the finger arteries\u2014the Physiocal system. An acronym for physiological calibration of the finger arteries, this Physiocal tracker was found to be accurate, robust and reliable.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe Finapres methodology was developed to use this information to calculate arterial pressure from finger cuff pressure data. A generalised algorithm to correct for the pressure level difference between the finger and brachial sites in patients was developed. This correction worked under all of the circumstances it was tested in\u2014even when it was not designed for it\u2014because it applied general physiological principles. This innovative brachial pressure waveform reconstruction method was first implemented in the Finometer, the successor of Finapres that BMI-TNO introduced to the market in 2000.{{Citation needed|date = June 2015}}\n\nThe availability of a continuous, high-fidelity, calibrated blood pressure waveform opened up the perspective of beat-to-beat computation of integrated haemodynamics, based on two notions: pressure and flow are inter-related at each site in the arterial system by their so-called characteristic impedance. At the proximal aortic site, the 3-element [[Windkessel effect|Windkessel]] model of this impedance can be modelled with sufficient accuracy in an individual patient with known age, gender, height and weight. According to comparisons of non-invasive peripheral vascular monitors, modest clinical utility is restricted to patients with normal and invariant circulation.<ref name=\"de Wilde\">{{cite journal | vauthors = de Wilde RB, Schreuder JJ, van den Berg PC, Jansen JR | title = An evaluation of cardiac output by five arterial pulse contour techniques during cardiac surgery | journal = Anaesthesia | volume = 62 | issue = 8 | pages = 760\u201368 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17635422 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2044.2007.05135.x }}</ref>\n\n====Invasive====\nInvasive PP monitoring involves inserting a [[manometer]] pressure sensor into an artery\u2014usually the [[radial artery|radial]] or [[femoral artery]]\u2014and continuously measuring the PP waveform. This is generally done by connecting the catheter to a signal processing device with a display. The PP waveform can then be analysed to provide measurements of cardiovascular performance.

Invasive PP measurements can be calibrated or uncalibrated.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n=====Calibrated PP \u2013 PiCCO, LiDCO=====\n{{merge|PiCCO (medical)|date=March 2020}}\n{{abbr|PiCCO|Pulse contour cardiac output}} ([[:de:PULSION Medical Systems|PULSION Medical Systems]] AG, Munich, Germany) and PulseCO (LiDCO Ltd, London, England) generate continuous ''Q'' by analysing the arterial PP waveform.

Recalibration is recommended after changes in patient position, therapy or condition.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIn PiCCO, transpulmonary thermodilution, which uses the Stewart-Hamilton principle but measures temperatures changes from central venous line to a central arterial line, i.e., the femoral or axillary arterial line, is used as the calibrating technique. The ''Q'' value derived from cold-saline thermodilution is used to calibrate the arterial PP contour, which can then provide continuous ''Q'' monitoring. The PiCCO algorithm is dependent on blood pressure waveform morphology (mathematical analysis of the PP waveform), and it calculates continuous ''Q'' as described by Wesseling and colleagues.<ref name=\"Wesseling\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wesseling KH, Jansen JR, Settels JJ, Schreuder JJ | title = Computation of aortic flow from pressure in humans using a nonlinear, three-element model | journal = Journal of Applied Physiology | volume = 74 | issue = 5 | pages = 2566\u201373 | date = May 1993 | pmid = 8335593 | doi = 10.1152/jappl.1993.74.5.2566 }}</ref> Transpulmonary thermodilution spans right heart, pulmonary circulation and left heart, allowing further mathematical analysis of the thermodilution curve and giving measurements of cardiac filling volumes ([[End-diastolic volume|{{abbr|GEDV|Global end diastolic volume}}]]), intrathoracic blood volume and extravascular lung water.

It estimates cardiac output (''Q'') using a standard arterial catheter with a manometer located in the femoral or radial artery. The device consists of a high-fidelity pressure transducer, which, when used with a supporting monitor (Vigileo or EV1000 monitor), derives left-sided cardiac output (''Q'') from a sample of arterial pulsations. The device uses an algorithm based on the [[Frank\u2013Starling law of the heart]], which states pulse pressure (PP) is proportional to stroke volume (SV). The algorithm calculates the product of the standard deviation of the arterial pressure (AP) wave over a sampled period of 20 seconds and a vascular tone factor (Khi, or \u03c7) to generate stroke volume. The equation in simplified form is:  <math display=\"inline\">SV = \\mathrm{std}(AP) \\cdot \\chi</math>, or, <math display=\"inline\">BP \\cdot k \\mathrm{\\ (constant)}</math>.  Khi is designed to reflect arterial resistance; compliance is a multivariate polynomial equation that continuously quantifies arterial compliance and vascular resistance. Khi does this by analyzing the morphological changes of arterial pressure waveforms on a bit-by-bit basis, based on the principle that changes in compliance or resistance affect the shape of the arterial pressure waveform. By analyzing the shape of said waveforms, the effect of vascular tone is assessed, allowing the calculation of SV. ''Q'' is then derived using equation ({{EquationNote|1}}). Only perfused beats that generate an arterial waveform are counted for in HR.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nThis system estimates Q using an existing arterial catheter with variable accuracy. These arterial monitors do not require intracardiac catheterisation from a pulmonary artery catheter. They require an arterial line and are therefore invasive.

These changes are proportional to the velocity of the protons' movement through a magnetic field with a known gradient. When using velocity-encoded MRI, the result is two sets of images, one for each time point in the cardiac cycle. One is an anatomical image and the other is an image in which the signal intensity in each [[pixel]] is directly proportional to the through-plane velocity. The average velocity in a vessel, i.e., the [[aorta]] or the [[pulmonary artery]], is quantified by measuring the average signal intensity of the pixels in the cross-section of the vessel then multiplying by a known constant. The flow is calculated by multiplying the mean velocity by the cross-sectional area of the vessel. This flow data can be used in a flow-versus-time graph. The area under the flow-versus-time curve for one [[cardiac cycle]] is the stroke volume. The length of the cardiac cycle is known and determines heart rate; ''Q'' can be calculated using equation ({{EquationNote|1}}).

Application of the Fick principle involves calculating the oxygen consumed over time by measuring the oxygen concentration of venous blood and arterial blood. ''Q'' is calculated from these measurements as follows:\n* ''V''<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> consumption per minute using a [[spirometer]] (with the subject re-breathing air) and a [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] absorber\n* the oxygen content of blood taken from the pulmonary artery (representing mixed venous blood)\n* the oxygen content of blood from a cannula in a peripheral artery (representing arterial blood)\n\nFrom these values, we know that:\n\n<math>V_{O_2} = (Q \\times C_A) - (Q \\times C_V)</math>\n\nwhere\n*''C''<sub>A</sub> is the oxygen content of arterial blood, and,\n*''C''<sub>V</sub> is the oxygen content of venous blood.\nThis allows us to say\n\n:<math> Q\\ = \\frac{{{V}_O}_2}{{C}_A - {C}_V} </math>\n\nand therefore calculate ''Q''.

There have been modifications to the Fick method where respiratory oxygen content is measured as part of a closed system and the consumed oxygen is calculated using an assumed oxygen consumption index, which is then used to calculate ''Q''. Other variations use [[inert gas]]es as tracers and measure the change in inspired and expired gas concentrations to calculate ''Q'' (Innocor, Innovision A/S, Denmark).\n\nThe calculation of the arterial and venous oxygen content of the blood is a straightforward process.  Almost all oxygen in the blood is bound to [[hemoglobin|h\u00e6moglobin]] molecules in the red blood cells.  Measuring the content of h\u00e6moglobin in the blood and the percentage of saturation of h\u00e6moglobin\u2014the oxygen saturation of the blood\u2014is a simple process and is readily available to physicians.

Temperature changes rather than dye concentration are measured at sites in the circulation; this method is known as thermodilution. The [[pulmonary artery catheter]] (PAC) introduced to clinical practice in 1970, also known as the [[Swan-Ganz catheter]], provides direct access to the right heart for thermodilution measurements. Continuous, invasive, cardiac monitoring in intensive care units has been mostly phased out. The PAC remains useful in right-heart study done in cardiac catheterisation laboratories.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe PAC is balloon tipped and is inflated, which helps \"sail\" the catheter balloon through the right ventricle to occlude a small branch of the pulmonary artery system. The balloon is then deflated. The PAC thermodilution method involves the injection of a small amount (10ml) of cold glucose at a known temperature into the pulmonary artery and measuring the temperature a known distance away {{Convert|6\u201310|cm|inch|abbr=on}} using the same catheter with temperature sensors set apart at a known distance.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe historically significant Swan-Ganz multi-lumen catheter allows reproducible calculation of cardiac output from a measured time-temperature curve, also known as the thermodilution curve. [[Thermistor]] technology enabled the observations that low CO registers temperature change slowly and high CO registers temperature change rapidly. The degree of temperature change is directly proportional to the cardiac output.

Values for cardiac output are usually denoted as L/min. For a healthy person weighing 70&nbsp;kg, the cardiac output at rest averages about 5 L/min; assuming a heart rate of 70 beats/min, the stroke volume would be approximately 70 ml.\n\nBecause cardiac output is related to the quantity of blood delivered to various parts of the body, it is an important component of how efficiently the heart can meet the body's demands for the maintenance of adequate tissue [[perfusion]]. Body tissues require continuous oxygen delivery which requires the sustained transport of oxygen to the tissues by the systemic circulation of oxygenated blood at an adequate pressure from the left ventricle of the heart via the aorta and arteries. Oxygen delivery (DO<sub>2</sub> mls/min) is the resultant of blood flow (cardiac output CO) times the blood oxygen content (CaO<sub>2</sub>). Mathematically this is calculated as follows: Oxygen delivery = cardiac output \u00d7 arterial oxygen content DO<sub>2</sub> = CO \u00d7 CaO<sub>2</sub>.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dunn|first=J.-Oc|last2=Mythen|first2=M.

The amount/percentage of the circulated oxygen consumed (VO<sub>2</sub>) per minute through metabolism varies depending on the activity level but at rest is circa 25% of the DO<sub>2</sub>.  Physical exercise requires a higher than resting-level of oxygen consumption to support increased muscle activity. In the case of [[heart failure]], actual CO may be insufficient to support even simple activities of daily living; nor can it increase sufficiently to meet the higher metabolic demands stemming from even moderate exercise.\n\nCardiac output is a global blood flow parameter of interest in [[hemodynamics|h\u00e6modynamics]], the study of the flow of blood. The factors affecting stroke volume and heart rate also affect cardiac output. The figure at the right margin illustrates this dependency and lists some of these factors. A detailed hierarchical illustration is provided in [[#2036SummaryOfFactorsInCardiacOutput|a subsequent figure]].\n\nThere are many methods of measuring CO, both invasively and non-invasively; each has advantages and drawbacks as described below.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Definition==\nThe function of the heart is to drive blood through the [[circulatory system]] in a cycle that delivers oxygen, nutrients and chemicals to the body's cells and removes cellular waste. Because it pumps out whatever blood comes back into it from the [[venous system]], the quantity of blood returning to the heart effectively determines the quantity of blood the heart pumps out \u2013 its cardiac output, ''Q''. Cardiac output is classically defined alongside [[stroke volume]] (SV) and the [[heart rate]] (HR) as:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>CO_{[L/min]} = SV_{[L/beat]} \\times HR_{[beats/min]}</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\nIn standardizing what CO values are considered to be within normal range independent of the size of the subject's body, the accepted convention is to further index equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) using [[Body surface area]] (BSA), giving rise to the [[Cardiac index]] (CI). This is detailed in equation ({{EquationNote|2}}) below.\n\n== Measurement ==\nThere are a number of clinical methods to measure cardiac output, ranging from direct intracardiac catheterization to non-invasive measurement of the arterial pulse. Each method has advantages and drawbacks. Relative comparison is limited by the absence of a widely accepted \"gold standard\" measurement. Cardiac output can also be affected significantly by the phase of respiration \u2013 intra-thoracic pressure changes influence diastolic filling and therefore cardiac output. This is especially important during mechanical ventilation, in which cardiac output can vary by up to 50%{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} across a single respiratory cycle. Cardiac output should therefore be measured at evenly spaced points over a single cycle or averaged over several cycles.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nInvasive methods are well accepted, but there is increasing evidence that these methods are neither accurate nor effective in guiding therapy.

This method generally requires patient sedation and is accepted for use in both adults and children.\n\n===Pulse pressure methods===\n[[Pulse pressure]] (PP) methods measure the pressure in an artery over time to derive a waveform and use this information to calculate cardiac performance. However, any measure from the artery includes changes in pressure associated with changes in arterial function, for example compliance and impedance. Physiological or therapeutic changes in vessel diameter are assumed to reflect changes in ''Q''. PP methods measure the combined performance of the heart and the blood vessels, thus limiting their application for measurement of ''Q''. This can be partially compensated for by intermittent calibration of the waveform to another ''Q'' measurement method then monitoring the PP waveform. Ideally, the PP waveform should be calibrated on a beat-to-beat basis. There are invasive and non-invasive methods of measuring PP.\n\n==== Finapres methodology ====\n\nIn 1967, the Czech physiologist Jan Pe\u0148\u00e1z invented and patented the [[Continuous noninvasive arterial pressure|volume clamp method]] of measuring continuous blood pressure. The principle of the volume clamp method is to dynamically provide equal pressures, on either side of an artery wall. By clamping the artery to a certain volume, inside pressure\u2014intra-arterial pressure\u2014balances outside pressure\u2014finger cuff pressure. Pe\u00f1\u00e1z decided the finger was the optimal site to apply this volume clamp method. The use of finger cuffs excludes the device from application in patients without vasoconstriction, such as in sepsis or in patients on vasopressors.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIn 1978, scientists at BMI-TNO, the research unit of [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research]] at the [[University of Amsterdam]], invented and patented a series of additional key elements that make the volume clamp work in clinical practice. These methods include the use of modulated infrared light in the optical system inside the sensor, the lightweight, easy-to-wrap finger cuff with [[velcro]] fixation, a new pneumatic proportional control valve principle, and a set point strategy for the determining and tracking the correct volume at which to clamp the finger arteries\u2014the Physiocal system. An acronym for physiological calibration of the finger arteries, this Physiocal tracker was found to be accurate, robust and reliable.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe Finapres methodology was developed to use this information to calculate arterial pressure from finger cuff pressure data. A generalised algorithm to correct for the pressure level difference between the finger and brachial sites in patients was developed. This correction worked under all of the circumstances it was tested in\u2014even when it was not designed for it\u2014because it applied general physiological principles. This innovative brachial pressure waveform reconstruction method was first implemented in the Finometer, the successor of Finapres that BMI-TNO introduced to the market in 2000.{{Citation needed|date = June 2015}}\n\nThe availability of a continuous, high-fidelity, calibrated blood pressure waveform opened up the perspective of beat-to-beat computation of integrated haemodynamics, based on two notions: pressure and flow are inter-related at each site in the arterial system by their so-called characteristic impedance. At the proximal aortic site, the 3-element [[Windkessel effect|Windkessel]] model of this impedance can be modelled with sufficient accuracy in an individual patient with known age, gender, height and weight. According to comparisons of non-invasive peripheral vascular monitors, modest clinical utility is restricted to patients with normal and invariant circulation.<ref name=\"de Wilde\">{{cite journal | vauthors = de Wilde RB, Schreuder JJ, van den Berg PC, Jansen JR | title = An evaluation of cardiac output by five arterial pulse contour techniques during cardiac surgery | journal = Anaesthesia | volume = 62 | issue = 8 | pages = 760\u201368 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17635422 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2044.2007.05135.x }}</ref>\n\n====Invasive====\nInvasive PP monitoring involves inserting a [[manometer]] pressure sensor into an artery\u2014usually the [[radial artery|radial]] or [[femoral artery]]\u2014and continuously measuring the PP waveform. This is generally done by connecting the catheter to a signal processing device with a display. The PP waveform can then be analysed to provide measurements of cardiovascular performance. Changes in vascular function, the position of the catheter tip or damping of the pressure waveform signal will affect the accuracy of the readings. Invasive PP measurements can be calibrated or uncalibrated.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n=====Calibrated PP \u2013 PiCCO, LiDCO=====\n{{merge|PiCCO (medical)|date=March 2020}}\n{{abbr|PiCCO|Pulse contour cardiac output}} ([[:de:PULSION Medical Systems|PULSION Medical Systems]] AG, Munich, Germany) and PulseCO (LiDCO Ltd, London, England) generate continuous ''Q'' by analysing the arterial PP waveform. In both cases, an independent technique is required to provide calibration of continuous ''Q'' analysis because arterial PP analysis cannot account for unmeasured variables such as the changing compliance of the vascular bed. Recalibration is recommended after changes in patient position, therapy or condition.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIn PiCCO, transpulmonary thermodilution, which uses the Stewart-Hamilton principle but measures temperatures changes from central venous line to a central arterial line, i.e., the femoral or axillary arterial line, is used as the calibrating technique. The ''Q'' value derived from cold-saline thermodilution is used to calibrate the arterial PP contour, which can then provide continuous ''Q'' monitoring. The PiCCO algorithm is dependent on blood pressure waveform morphology (mathematical analysis of the PP waveform), and it calculates continuous ''Q'' as described by Wesseling and colleagues.<ref name=\"Wesseling\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wesseling KH, Jansen JR, Settels JJ, Schreuder JJ | title = Computation of aortic flow from pressure in humans using a nonlinear, three-element model | journal = Journal of Applied Physiology | volume = 74 | issue = 5 | pages = 2566\u201373 | date = May 1993 | pmid = 8335593 | doi = 10.1152/jappl.1993.74.5.2566 }}</ref> Transpulmonary thermodilution spans right heart, pulmonary circulation and left heart, allowing further mathematical analysis of the thermodilution curve and giving measurements of cardiac filling volumes ([[End-diastolic volume|{{abbr|GEDV|Global end diastolic volume}}]]), intrathoracic blood volume and extravascular lung water.

It estimates cardiac output (''Q'') using a standard arterial catheter with a manometer located in the femoral or radial artery. The device consists of a high-fidelity pressure transducer, which, when used with a supporting monitor (Vigileo or EV1000 monitor), derives left-sided cardiac output (''Q'') from a sample of arterial pulsations. The device uses an algorithm based on the [[Frank\u2013Starling law of the heart]], which states pulse pressure (PP) is proportional to stroke volume (SV). The algorithm calculates the product of the standard deviation of the arterial pressure (AP) wave over a sampled period of 20 seconds and a vascular tone factor (Khi, or \u03c7) to generate stroke volume. The equation in simplified form is:  <math display=\"inline\">SV = \\mathrm{std}(AP) \\cdot \\chi</math>, or, <math display=\"inline\">BP \\cdot k \\mathrm{\\ (constant)}</math>.  Khi is designed to reflect arterial resistance; compliance is a multivariate polynomial equation that continuously quantifies arterial compliance and vascular resistance. Khi does this by analyzing the morphological changes of arterial pressure waveforms on a bit-by-bit basis, based on the principle that changes in compliance or resistance affect the shape of the arterial pressure waveform. By analyzing the shape of said waveforms, the effect of vascular tone is assessed, allowing the calculation of SV. ''Q'' is then derived using equation ({{EquationNote|1}}). Only perfused beats that generate an arterial waveform are counted for in HR.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nThis system estimates Q using an existing arterial catheter with variable accuracy. These arterial monitors do not require intracardiac catheterisation from a pulmonary artery catheter. They require an arterial line and are therefore invasive. As with other arterial waveform systems, the short set-up and data acquisition times are benefits of this technology.

These changes are proportional to the velocity of the protons' movement through a magnetic field with a known gradient. When using velocity-encoded MRI, the result is two sets of images, one for each time point in the cardiac cycle. One is an anatomical image and the other is an image in which the signal intensity in each [[pixel]] is directly proportional to the through-plane velocity. The average velocity in a vessel, i.e., the [[aorta]] or the [[pulmonary artery]], is quantified by measuring the average signal intensity of the pixels in the cross-section of the vessel then multiplying by a known constant. The flow is calculated by multiplying the mean velocity by the cross-sectional area of the vessel. This flow data can be used in a flow-versus-time graph. The area under the flow-versus-time curve for one [[cardiac cycle]] is the stroke volume. The length of the cardiac cycle is known and determines heart rate; ''Q'' can be calculated using equation ({{EquationNote|1}}).

During systole, the LV contracts and ejects blood until it reaches its minimum capacity known as end systolic volume (ESV). It does not completely empty.

Application of the Fick principle involves calculating the oxygen consumed over time by measuring the oxygen concentration of venous blood and arterial blood. ''Q'' is calculated from these measurements as follows:\n* ''V''<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> consumption per minute using a [[spirometer]] (with the subject re-breathing air) and a [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] absorber\n* the oxygen content of blood taken from the pulmonary artery (representing mixed venous blood)\n* the oxygen content of blood from a cannula in a peripheral artery (representing arterial blood)\n\nFrom these values, we know that:\n\n<math>V_{O_2} = (Q \\times C_A) - (Q \\times C_V)</math>\n\nwhere\n*''C''<sub>A</sub> is the oxygen content of arterial blood, and,\n*''C''<sub>V</sub> is the oxygen content of venous blood.\nThis allows us to say\n\n:<math> Q\\ = \\frac{{{V}_O}_2}{{C}_A - {C}_V} </math>\n\nand therefore calculate ''Q''. ''(C<sub>A</sub> \u2013 C<sub>V</sub>)'' is also known as the [[arteriovenous oxygen difference]].<ref name=\"avo2diff-jrank\">{{cite web|title=Arteriovenous oxygen difference |url=http://sports.jrank.org/pages/5973/arteriovenous-oxygen-difference.html |work=Sports Medicine, Sports Science and Kinesiology |publisher=Net Industries |access-date=30 April 2011 |year=2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612142755/http://sports.jrank.org/pages/5973/arteriovenous-oxygen-difference.html |archive-date=12 June 2011 }}{{MEDRS|date=October 2014}}</ref>\n\nWhile considered to be the most accurate method of measuring ''Q'', the Fick method is invasive and requires time for sample analysis, and accurate oxygen consumption samples are difficult to acquire. There have been modifications to the Fick method where respiratory oxygen content is measured as part of a closed system and the consumed oxygen is calculated using an assumed oxygen consumption index, which is then used to calculate ''Q''. Other variations use [[inert gas]]es as tracers and measure the change in inspired and expired gas concentrations to calculate ''Q'' (Innocor, Innovision A/S, Denmark).\n\nThe calculation of the arterial and venous oxygen content of the blood is a straightforward process.  Almost all oxygen in the blood is bound to [[hemoglobin|h\u00e6moglobin]] molecules in the red blood cells.  Measuring the content of h\u00e6moglobin in the blood and the percentage of saturation of h\u00e6moglobin\u2014the oxygen saturation of the blood\u2014is a simple process and is readily available to physicians. Each [[gram]] of haemoglobin can carry 1.34 ml of [[oxygen|O<sub>2</sub>]]; the oxygen content of the blood\u2014either arterial or venous\u2014can be estimated using the following formula:\n\n:<math> \\begin{align}\n\\mathrm{Oxygen\\ content\\ of\\ blood} &= \\left [\\mathrm{haemoglobin} \\right] \\left ( g/dl \\right ) \\ \\times\\ 1.34 \\left ( ml\\ \\mathrm{O}_2 /\\mathrm{g\\ of\\ haemoglobin} \\right ) \\\\\n&\\times\\ \\mathrm{saturation\\ of\\ blood}\\ \\left ( \\mathrm{percent} \\right )\\ +\\ 0.0032\\ \\times\\ \\mathrm{partial\\ pressure\\ of\\ oxygen} \\left ( torr \\right )\n\\end{align} </math>\n\n===Pulmonary artery thermodilution (trans-right-heart thermodilution)===\n[[File:Pulmonary artery catheter english.JPG|alt=Diagram of Pulmonary artery catheter (PAC)|thumb|Diagram of Pulmonary artery catheter (PAC)]]\n\nThe indicator method was further developed by replacing the indicator dye with heated or cooled fluid. Temperature changes rather than dye concentration are measured at sites in the circulation; this method is known as thermodilution. The [[pulmonary artery catheter]] (PAC) introduced to clinical practice in 1970, also known as the [[Swan-Ganz catheter]], provides direct access to the right heart for thermodilution measurements. Continuous, invasive, cardiac monitoring in intensive care units has been mostly phased out. The PAC remains useful in right-heart study done in cardiac catheterisation laboratories.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe PAC is balloon tipped and is inflated, which helps \"sail\" the catheter balloon through the right ventricle to occlude a small branch of the pulmonary artery system. The balloon is then deflated. The PAC thermodilution method involves the injection of a small amount (10ml) of cold glucose at a known temperature into the pulmonary artery and measuring the temperature a known distance away {{Convert|6\u201310|cm|inch|abbr=on}} using the same catheter with temperature sensors set apart at a known distance.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe historically significant Swan-Ganz multi-lumen catheter allows reproducible calculation of cardiac output from a measured time-temperature curve, also known as the thermodilution curve. [[Thermistor]] technology enabled the observations that low CO registers temperature change slowly and high CO registers temperature change rapidly. The degree of temperature change is directly proportional to the cardiac output. In this unique method, three or four repeated measurements or passes are usually averaged to improve accuracy.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Iberti TJ, Fischer EP, Leibowitz AB, Panacek EA, Silverstein JH, Albertson TE | title = A multicenter study of physicians' knowledge of the pulmonary artery catheter.
