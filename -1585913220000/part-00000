From 1939 to 1982 it was home to the artist [[Cedric Morris]], who ran the [[East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing]] in the house, and in the garden grew a significant botanical collection.\n==The Building==\nBenton End is thought to have been built in the 1520s. The first documented inhabitant is Robert Rolfe, a cloth merchant and \"chief inhabitant\" of Hadleigh<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sydenham |first1=Henry Augustus Hervey |title=Suffolk in 1524: Being the Return for a Subsidy Granted in 1523 |date=1910 |publisher=G.

Benton End afforded space for Morris, Lett-Haines and many of their students to live as well as work at the School. This contributed to the communal atmosphere, and encouraged its laissez-faire but inspiring approach to learning. Jon Lys Turner's biography of illustrator [[Richard Chopping]] and his partner Denis Wirth-Miller, both alumni of the East Anglian School, characterises it as \n{{Quote|text=a place for the free exchange of artistic ideas and techniques. The school was anti-hierarchical as well as anti-patriarchal, with little in the way of structure or rules, and provided a setting for sexual as well as artistic liberation.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lys Turner |first1=Jon |title=The Visitors' Book: In Francis Bacon's Shadow: The Lives of Richard Chopping and Denis Wirth-Miller |date=2016 |publisher=Constable |location=Great Britain |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=i12sCwAAQBAJ |accessdate=31 March 2020}}</ref>}} While Morris focused on the students' work, Lett-Haines was in charge of the school's administration as well as cooking two meals a day. Thanks to Morris' work in the vegetable garden and Lett-Haines' enthusiasm for cooking, the community at Benton End did not experience hardships on the scale of wartime London - indeed, according to Lys Turner, the war years were \"markedly hedonistic\".\n\nThrough the 40s and 50s Benton End became the centre of a diverse community of twentieth-century artists, writers and horticulturalists<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_/ai_n9158512 Andrew Lambirth ''Creative outsiders'' The Spectator, ,  Nov 9, 2002]</ref>.

Benton End afforded space for Morris, Lett-Haines and many of their students to live as well as work at the School. This contributed to the communal atmosphere, and encouraged its laissez-faire but inspiring approach to learning. Jon Lys Turner's biography of illustrator [[Richard Chopping]] and his partner Denis Wirth-Miller, both alumni of the East Anglian School, characterises it as \n{{Quote|text=a place for the free exchange of artistic ideas and techniques.

Thanks to Morris' work in the vegetable garden and Lett-Haines' enthusiasm for cooking, the community at Benton End did not experience hardships on the scale of wartime London - indeed, according to Lys Turner, the war years were \"markedly hedonistic\".\n\nThrough the 40s and 50s Benton End became the centre of a diverse community of twentieth-century artists, writers and horticulturalists<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_/ai_n9158512 Andrew Lambirth ''Creative outsiders'' The Spectator, ,  Nov 9, 2002]</ref>.

Each district is an independent special-purpose government, or dependent school systems, under the guidelines of each [[U.S. state]] government and local school boards. A school district is a legally separate [[legal personality|body corporate and politic]]. School districts are local governments with powers similar to that of a [[town]] or a [[County (United States)|county]] including [[taxation]] and [[eminent domain]], except in [[Virginia]], whose [[school division]]s have no taxing authority and must depend on another local government (county, city, or town) for funding. Its governing body, which is typically elected by direct popular vote but may be appointed by other governmental officials, is called a ''[[school board]]'', ''board of trustees'', ''board of education,'' ''school committee'', or the like. This body appoints a ''[[Superintendent (education)|superintendent]]'', usually an experienced public school administrator, to function as the district's [[chief executive]] for carrying out day-to-day decisions and policy implementations. The school board may also exercise a [[quasi-judicial]] function in serious [[employee]] or [[student]] [[discipline]] matters.\n\nSchool districts in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and [[Western United States|West]] tend to cross municipal boundaries, while school districts in [[New England]] and the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]] regions tend to adhere to city, township, and/or county boundaries.<ref>\"[https://www.census.gov/did/www/schooldistricts/ School Districts]\" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6ZQDSNym9 Archive]) [[U.S. Census Bureau]].

In most Southern states, school systems operate either as an arm of county government, or at least share coextensive boundaries with the state's counties.  In Maryland, most school systems are run at the county level, but the [[Baltimore|Baltimore City]] system operates separately, at a [[county-equivalent]] level. In [[New York (state)|New York]], most [[Administrative divisions of New York#School district|school districts]] are separate governmental units with the power to levy taxes and incur debt, except for the five cities with population over 125,000, where the schools are operated directly by the municipalities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dos.ny.gov/lg/publications/Local_Government_Handbook.pdf|title=Local Government Handbook|date=2018-05-13|publisher=New York Department of State, Division of Local Government Services|page=75|orig-year=2009|accessdate=31 August 2018|edition=6th}}</ref> The [[Hawaii State Department of Education]] functions as a single statewide school district.

The decision in assigning teachers can occur with the collaboration of human resource staff or decisions from the collaboration with principals and teachers.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Monk | first1 = D.

The first popular approach is assigning students to teachers based on sharing the same characteristics as their students.<ref>Kraemer, S., Worth, R., & Meyer, R. H. (2011, April). Classroom assignment practices in urban school districts using teacher level value-added systems. In Association for Education Finance and Policy Annual Conference.</ref> For instance, principals assign teachers to students based on academic performance, teachers\u2019 personalities, teachers teaching styles, and teachers\u2019 classroom management skills. During this assignment practices, there are some collaboration with teachers and principals. The second most popular approach is that teachers can be assigned based on their ability to improve students\u2019 standardized test scores. This is identified as \u201cstaffing to the test\u201d<ref name=\":0\">Cohen-Vogel, L. (2011). \u201cStaffing to the test\u201d are today\u2019s school personnel practices evidence based?

Its governing body, which is typically elected by direct popular vote but may be appointed by other governmental officials, is called a ''[[school board]]'', ''board of trustees'', ''board of education,'' ''school committee'', or the like. This body appoints a ''[[Superintendent (education)|superintendent]]'', usually an experienced public school administrator, to function as the district's [[chief executive]] for carrying out day-to-day decisions and policy implementations. The school board may also exercise a [[quasi-judicial]] function in serious [[employee]] or [[student]] [[discipline]] matters.\n\nSchool districts in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and [[Western United States|West]] tend to cross municipal boundaries, while school districts in [[New England]] and the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]] regions tend to adhere to city, township, and/or county boundaries.<ref>\"[https://www.census.gov/did/www/schooldistricts/ School Districts]\" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6ZQDSNym9 Archive]) [[U.S. Census Bureau]].

Moreover, school district boundaries rarely coincide with municipal limits or county lines.  Most districts use the term \"Independent School District\" in their name; in the few cases where the term \"Common School District\" is used the district is still an independent governmental entity.\n*In [[Ohio]], school districts are classified as either ''city'' school districts, ''exempted village'' school districts, or ''local'' school districts. City and exempted village school districts are exempted from county boards of education, while local school districts remain under county school board supervision. School districts may combine resources to form a fourth type of school district, the joint vocational school district, which focuses on a technical skills\u2013based curriculum.<ref>[http://ohioline.osu.edu/b835/b835_4.html Special Purpose Governments], Ohio State University.

The local schools districts run the schools and most programs, but often bilingual aides, programs for the deaf and blind, special education for the severely impaired, and career and technical education programs are run by the intermediate school district or equivalent.\n*County-wide school districts are mostly commonly found in Mid-Atlantic and Southern states such as [[Maryland]], [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Florida]], [[Alabama]], [[Mississippi]], [[Louisiana]], [[Tennessee]], and [[Kentucky]]. Nevada and Utah also have mostly county-wide school districts, and Alaska has many [[Boroughs of Alaska|borough]]-wide school districts. [[Hawaii]] operates its schools at the state level through its [[Hawai'i Department of Education|department of education]].\n*In [[Maine]], there are [[regional school unit]]s wherein smaller districts were consolidated into RSUs in 2008 when state laws changed.\n\n====== Teacher assignment practices in school districts ======\n{{Off topic|date=May 2017|Teacher}}\n\nThere are various approaches when making decisions in assigning teachers. The decision in assigning teachers can occur with the collaboration of human resource staff or decisions from the collaboration with principals and teachers.<ref>Monk, D. H. (1987). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1002040 \"Assigning elementary pupils to their teachers.\"]. ''The Elementary School Journal''. 88(2): 166\u2013187.</ref> Although the decisions for teacher assignment can vary base on school districts, there are two most popular approaches that are currently occurring in assigning teachers. The first popular approach is assigning students to teachers based on sharing the same characteristics as their students.<ref>Kraemer, S., Worth, R., & Meyer, R. H. (2011, April). Classroom assignment practices in urban school districts using teacher level value-added systems. In Association for Education Finance and Policy Annual Conference.</ref> For instance, principals assign teachers to students based on academic performance, teachers\u2019 personalities, teachers teaching styles, and teachers\u2019 classroom management skills. During this assignment practices, there are some collaboration with teachers and principals. The second most popular approach is that teachers can be assigned based on their ability to improve students\u2019 standardized test scores. This is identified as \u201cstaffing to the test\u201d<ref name=\":0\">Cohen-Vogel, L. (2011). \u201cStaffing to the test\u201d are today\u2019s school personnel practices evidence based? Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, 33(4), 483-505. doi: 10.3102/0162373711419845.</ref> in which principals observe the influence teachers have on students\u2019 standardized test scores and then strategically move teachers to certain subjects or grades where standardized test are given.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEven though two approaches are used to assign teachers to students, there are some obstacles that principals encounter when making teacher assignment decisions. For instance, one conflict is parents demand that their child be assigned to a specific teacher.<ref>Clotfelter, C.T., Ladd, H.F., & Vigdor, J. (2005). Who teaches whom? Race and the distribution of novice teachers. ''Economics of Education Review, 24''(4), 377-392. {{doi|10.1016/j.econedurev.2004.06.008}}\n</ref> The second conflict is that principals need to take into consideration policies, such as tenure or collective bargaining, which can influence teacher assignment practices.<ref name=\"Youngs, P. 2015\">Youngs, P., Pogodzinski, B., & Galey, S.

These are works recognized by the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox Churches as being part of scripture (and thus deuterocanonical rather than apocryphal), but Protestants do not recognize them as [[Biblical inspiration|divinely inspired]].

Catholics and Orthodox also accept those books present in manuscripts of the Septuagint, an ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament with great currency among the Jews of the ancient world, with the coda that Catholics consider [[3 Esdras]] and [[3 Maccabees]] apocryphal.\n\nMost quotations of the Old Testament in the New Testament, differing by varying degrees from the Masoretic Text, are taken from the Septuagint. Daniel was written several hundred years after the time of Ezra, and since that time several books of the Septuagint have been found in the original Hebrew, in the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], the [[Cairo Geniza]], and at [[Masada]], including a Hebrew text of Sirach (Qumran, Masada) and an Aramaic text of Tobit (Qumran); the additions to Esther and Daniel are also in their respective Semitic languages.\n\nThe unanimous consensus of modern (and ancient) scholars consider several other books, including 1 Maccabees and Judith, to have been composed in Hebrew or Aramaic.{{citation needed |date=January 2016}} Opinion is divided on the book of Baruch, while it is acknowledged that the Letter of Jeremiah, the Wisdom of Solomon, and 2 Maccabees are originally Greek compositions.\n\n=====Roman Catholic=====\nAdditional books accepted by the [[Roman Catholic Church]]:\n* [[Book of Tobit|Tobit \u2013 200 BC]]\n* [[Book of Judith|Judith \u2013 150 BC]]\n* [[Book of Baruch|Baruch]] with the [[Letter of Jeremiah]] \u2013 150\u201350 BC\n* [[Book of Sirach|Sirach \u2013 132 BC]]\n* [[1 Maccabees]] \u2013 110 BC\n* [[2 Maccabees]] \u2013 110\u2013170 BC\n* [[Book of Wisdom|Wisdom \u2013 30 BC]]\n* [[Book of Esther#Additions to Esther|Additions to Esther \u2013 140\u2013130 BC]]\n* [[Additions to Daniel]]:<ref name=\"The Rest of Daniel\">(Prayer of Azariah) - 200-0 BC,\nBel, and Susanna are often enumerated as one book,\n\"Additions to Daniel\"</ref>\n** [[The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children]] \u2013 200\u20130 BC\n** [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna and the Elders \u2013 200\u20130 BC]]\n** [[Bel and the Dragon]] \u2013 100 BC\n\n=====Eastern Orthodox=====\nAdditional books accepted by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]:\n* [[1 Esdras]]/3 Esdras<ref>Including what is known as [[5 Ezra]] (ch. 1\u20132) and [[6 Ezra]] (ch. 15\u201316); only chapters 3\u201314 are denoted 4 Ezra proper in critical editions; the full book of 16 chapters is often printed as one work, \"2 Esdras\" or \"4 Esdras\", in popular editions.

The order of the books of the Torah are universal through all denominations of Judaism and Christianity.\n\nThe disputed books, included in one canon but not in others, are often called the [[Biblical apocrypha]], a term that is sometimes used specifically to describe the books in the Catholic and Orthodox canons that are absent from the Jewish Masoretic Text and most modern [[Protestant]] Bibles. Catholics, following the [[Canon of Trent]] (1546), describe these books as deuterocanonical, while Greek Orthodox Christians, following the [[Synod of Jerusalem (1672)]], use the traditional name of ''[[anagignoskomena]]'', meaning \"that which is to be read.\" They are present in a few historic Protestant versions; the German [[Luther Bible]] included such books, as did the English [[Authorized King James Version|1611 King James Version]].<ref name=\"39articles\">The foundational [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] of [[Anglicanism]], in [[:s:Thirty-Nine Articles|Article VI]], asserts that these disputed books are not (to be) used \"to establish any doctrine,\" but \"read for example of life.\" Although the Biblical apocrypha are still used in [[Anglican Liturgy]], (\"Two of the hymns used in the American Prayer Book office of Morning Prayer, the [[Benedictus (Song of Zechariah)|Benedictus es]] and [[Benedicite]], are taken from the Apocrypha. One of the offertory sentences in Holy Communion comes from an apocryphal book (Tob. 4: 8-9). Lessons from the Apocrypha are regularly appointed to read in the daily, Sunday, and special services of Morning and Evening Prayer. There are altogether 111 such lessons in the latest revised American Prayer Book Lectionary [The books used are: II Esdras, Tobit, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Baruch, Three Holy Children, and I Maccabees.]\" \u2014[http://orthodoxanglican.net/downloads/apocrypha.pdf The Apocrypha, Bridge of the Testaments] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205074449/http://orthodoxanglican.net/downloads/apocrypha.pdf |date=February 5, 2009 }}), the modern trend has been to not even print the Old Testament Apocrypha in editions of Anglican-used Bibles.</ref>\n\nEmpty table cells indicate that a book is absent from that canon.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

These are works recognized by the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox Churches as being part of scripture (and thus deuterocanonical rather than apocryphal), but Protestants do not recognize them as [[Biblical inspiration|divinely inspired]]. Orthodox differentiate scriptural books by omitting these (and others) from corporate worship and from use as a sole basis for doctrine.{{citation needed |date=December 2015}}\n\nMany recognize them as good, but not on the level of the other books of the Bible. [[Anglicanism]] considers the apocrypha worthy of being \"read for example of life\" but not to be used \"to establish any doctrine.\"<ref name=\"39articles\" /> [[Luther's canon|Luther]] made a parallel statement in calling them: \"not considered equal to the Holy Scriptures, but...useful and good to read.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC05742122&id=rl3lcbLkHV0C&pg=PA521&lpg=PA521&dq=luther+%22are+useful+and+good+to+read%22|title=The Popular and Critical Bible Encyclop\u00e6dia and Scriptural Dictionary, Fully Defining and Explaining All Religious Terms, Including Biographical, Geographical, Historical, Arch\u00e6ological and Doctrinal Themes |p=521|editor=[[Samuel Fallows]]|publisher=The Howard-Severance company|origyear=1901|year=1910|display-editors=etal}}</ref>\n\nThe difference in canons derives from the difference in the Masoretic Text and the [[Septuagint]]. Books found in both the Hebrew and the Greek are accepted by all denominations, and by Jews, these are the protocanonical books. Catholics and Orthodox also accept those books present in manuscripts of the Septuagint, an ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament with great currency among the Jews of the ancient world, with the coda that Catholics consider [[3 Esdras]] and [[3 Maccabees]] apocryphal.\n\nMost quotations of the Old Testament in the New Testament, differing by varying degrees from the Masoretic Text, are taken from the Septuagint. Daniel was written several hundred years after the time of Ezra, and since that time several books of the Septuagint have been found in the original Hebrew, in the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], the [[Cairo Geniza]], and at [[Masada]], including a Hebrew text of Sirach (Qumran, Masada) and an Aramaic text of Tobit (Qumran); the additions to Esther and Daniel are also in their respective Semitic languages.\n\nThe unanimous consensus of modern (and ancient) scholars consider several other books, including 1 Maccabees and Judith, to have been composed in Hebrew or Aramaic.{{citation needed |date=January 2016}} Opinion is divided on the book of Baruch, while it is acknowledged that the Letter of Jeremiah, the Wisdom of Solomon, and 2 Maccabees are originally Greek compositions.\n\n=====Roman Catholic=====\nAdditional books accepted by the [[Roman Catholic Church]]:\n* [[Book of Tobit|Tobit \u2013 200 BC]]\n* [[Book of Judith|Judith \u2013 150 BC]]\n* [[Book of Baruch|Baruch]] with the [[Letter of Jeremiah]] \u2013 150\u201350 BC\n* [[Book of Sirach|Sirach \u2013 132 BC]]\n* [[1 Maccabees]] \u2013 110 BC\n* [[2 Maccabees]] \u2013 110\u2013170 BC\n* [[Book of Wisdom|Wisdom of Solomon \u2013 30 BC]]\n* [[Book of Esther#Additions to Esther|Additions to Esther \u2013 140\u2013130 BC]]\n* [[Additions to Daniel]]:<ref name=\"The Rest of Daniel\">(Prayer of Azariah) - 200-0 BC,\nBel, and Susanna are often enumerated as one book,\n\"Additions to Daniel\"</ref>\n** [[The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children]] \u2013 200\u20130 BC\n** [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna and the Elders \u2013 200\u20130 BC]]\n** [[Bel and the Dragon]] \u2013 100 BC\n\n=====Eastern Orthodox=====\nAdditional books accepted by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]:\n* [[1 Esdras]]/3 Esdras<ref>Including what is known as [[5 Ezra]] (ch. 1\u20132) and [[6 Ezra]] (ch. 15\u201316); only chapters 3\u201314 are denoted 4 Ezra proper in critical editions; the full book of 16 chapters is often printed as one work, \"2 Esdras\" or \"4 Esdras\", in popular editions.

For the Catholic canon, the Douaic titles are provided in parentheses when these differ from those editions. Likewise, the King James Version references some of these books by the traditional spelling when referring to them in the New Testament, such as \"Esaias\" (for Isaiah).\n\nIn the spirit of [[ecumenism]] more recent Catholic translations (e.g., the [[New American Bible]], [[Jerusalem Bible]], and ecumenical translations used by Catholics, such as the [[Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition]]) use the same \"standardized\" (King James Version) spellings and names as Protestant Bibles (e.g., 1 Chronicles, as opposed to the Douaic 1 Paralipomenon, 1\u20132 Samuel and 1\u20132 Kings, instead of 1\u20134 Kings) in those books universally considered canonical\u2014the [[Protocanonical books|protocanonicals]].\n\nThe [[Talmud]] in [[Bava Batra]] 14b gives a different order for the books in ''Nevi'im'' and ''Ketuvim''. This order is also quoted in [[Mishneh Torah]] Hilchot [[Sefer (Hebrew)|Sefer]] [[Torah]] 7:15. The order of the books of the Torah are universal through all denominations of Judaism and Christianity.\n\nThe disputed books, included in one canon but not in others, are often called the [[Biblical apocrypha]], a term that is sometimes used specifically to describe the books in the Catholic and Orthodox canons that are absent from the Jewish Masoretic Text and most modern [[Protestant]] Bibles. Catholics, following the [[Canon of Trent]] (1546), describe these books as deuterocanonical, while Greek Orthodox Christians, following the [[Synod of Jerusalem (1672)]], use the traditional name of ''[[anagignoskomena]]'', meaning \"that which is to be read.\" They are present in a few historic Protestant versions; the German [[Luther Bible]] included such books, as did the English [[Authorized King James Version|1611 King James Version]].<ref name=\"39articles\">The foundational [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] of [[Anglicanism]], in [[:s:Thirty-Nine Articles|Article VI]], asserts that these disputed books are not (to be) used \"to establish any doctrine,\" but \"read for example of life.\" Although the Biblical apocrypha are still used in [[Anglican Liturgy]], (\"Two of the hymns used in the American Prayer Book office of Morning Prayer, the [[Benedictus (Song of Zechariah)|Benedictus es]] and [[Benedicite]], are taken from the Apocrypha. One of the offertory sentences in Holy Communion comes from an apocryphal book (Tob. 4: 8-9). Lessons from the Apocrypha are regularly appointed to read in the daily, Sunday, and special services of Morning and Evening Prayer. There are altogether 111 such lessons in the latest revised American Prayer Book Lectionary [The books used are: II Esdras, Tobit, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Baruch, Three Holy Children, and I Maccabees.]\" \u2014[http://orthodoxanglican.net/downloads/apocrypha.pdf The Apocrypha, Bridge of the Testaments] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205074449/http://orthodoxanglican.net/downloads/apocrypha.pdf |date=February 5, 2009 }}), the modern trend has been to not even print the Old Testament Apocrypha in editions of Anglican-used Bibles.</ref>\n\nEmpty table cells indicate that a book is absent from that canon.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
