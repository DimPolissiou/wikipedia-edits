She was found 19 months after being abducted, by which time she was a fugitive wanted for serious crimes committed with members of the group. She was held in custody, and there was speculation before trial that her family's resources would enable her to avoid time in jail.\n\nAt her trial, the prosecution suggested that Hearst had joined the Symbionese Liberation Army of her own volition. However, she testified that she had been raped and threatened with death while held captive. In 1976, she was convicted for the crime of bank robbery and sentenced to 35 years in prison, later reduced to 7 years.

According to testimony, the group's main intention was to leverage the Hearst family's political influence to free two SLA members who had been arrested for [[Marcus Foster|Marcus Foster's]] killing. Faced with the failure to free the imprisoned men, the SLA demanded that the captive's family distribute $70 worth of food to every needy Californian \u2013 an operation that would cost an estimated $400 million. In response, Hearst's father took out a loan and arranged the immediate donation of $2 million worth of food to the poor of the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]], in an operation called \"People in Need.\" After the distribution descended into chaos, the SLA refused to release Hearst.<ref name=\"Patrick Mondout\">{{cite web |url=http://www.super70s.com/Super70s/News/Special-Reports/Terrorism/SLA/Chronology.asp |title=SLA Chronology |access-date=January 21, 2007 |last=Patrick Mondout |quote= |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420055116/http://www.super70s.com/Super70s/News/Special-Reports/Terrorism/SLA/Chronology.asp |archivedate=April 20, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n====Hearst's account====\nAccording to Hearst's later testimony, she was held for a week in a closet, blindfolded and with her hands tied, during which time SLA founder and leader Cinque ([[Donald DeFreeze]]) repeatedly threatened her with death.<ref name=\"law2.umkc.edu\">''Selected Trial Transcript Excerpts in the Patty Hearst Trial'', [http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/hearst/hearstranscriptexcerpts.html \"Excerpt of Cross-Examination of Defendant, Patty Hearst\"]</ref> She was let out for meals and, blindfolded, began to join in the political discussions.

She became internationally known for events following her 1974 kidnapping by the left-wing terrorist [[Symbionese Liberation Army]]. She was found 19 months after being abducted, by which time she was a fugitive wanted for serious crimes committed with members of the group. She was held in custody, and there was speculation before trial that her family's resources would enable her to avoid time in jail.\n\nAt her trial, the prosecution suggested that Hearst had joined the Symbionese Liberation Army of her own volition. However, she testified that she had been raped and threatened with death while held captive. In 1976, she was convicted for the crime of bank robbery and sentenced to 35 years in prison, later reduced to 7 years. Her sentence was commuted by President [[Jimmy Carter]], and she was pardoned by President [[Bill Clinton]].\n\n==Background ==\n===Family===\nHearst's grandfather, [[William Randolph Hearst]], created the largest newspaper, magazine, newsreel, and movie business in the world.

According to testimony, the group's main intention was to leverage the Hearst family's political influence to free two SLA members who had been arrested for [[Marcus Foster|Marcus Foster's]] killing. Faced with the failure to free the imprisoned men, the SLA demanded that the captive's family distribute $70 worth of food to every needy Californian \u2013 an operation that would cost an estimated $400 million. In response, Hearst's father took out a loan and arranged the immediate donation of $2 million worth of food to the poor of the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]], in an operation called \"People in Need.\" After the distribution descended into chaos, the SLA refused to release Hearst.<ref name=\"Patrick Mondout\">{{cite web |url=http://www.super70s.com/Super70s/News/Special-Reports/Terrorism/SLA/Chronology.asp |title=SLA Chronology |access-date=January 21, 2007 |last=Patrick Mondout |quote= |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420055116/http://www.super70s.com/Super70s/News/Special-Reports/Terrorism/SLA/Chronology.asp |archivedate=April 20, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n====Hearst's account====\nAccording to Hearst's later testimony, she was held for a week in a closet, blindfolded and with her hands tied, during which time SLA founder and leader Cinque ([[Donald DeFreeze]]) repeatedly threatened her with death.<ref name=\"law2.umkc.edu\">''Selected Trial Transcript Excerpts in the Patty Hearst Trial'', [http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/hearst/hearstranscriptexcerpts.html \"Excerpt of Cross-Examination of Defendant, Patty Hearst\"]</ref> She was let out for meals and, blindfolded, began to join in the political discussions.

The film received positive reviews from critics and has grossed $21 million.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Robert Bilott]] is a corporate defense lawyer from [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] working for law firm [[Taft Stettinius & Hollister]]. Farmer Wilbur Tennant, who knows Robert's grandmother, asks Robert to investigate a number of unexplained deaths in [[Parkersburg, West Virginia]]. Tennant connects the deaths to the chemical manufacturing corporation [[DuPont (1802-2017)|DuPont]], and gives Robert a large case of videotapes.\n\nRobert visits the Tennants' farm, where he learns that 190 cattle have died with unusual medical conditions such as bloated organs, blackened teeth, and tumors. DuPont attorney Phil Donnelly tells him he is not aware of the case but will help out in any way he can. Robert files a small suit so he can gain information through [[legal discovery]] of the chemicals dumped on the site. When he finds nothing useful in the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] report, he realizes the chemicals might not be regulated by the EPA.\n\nRobert confronts Phil at an industry event, leading to an angry exchange. DuPont sends Robert hundreds of boxes, hoping to bury the evidence. Robert finds numerous references to PFOA, a chemical with no references in any medical textbook. In the middle of the night, Robert's pregnant wife Sarah finds him tearing the carpet off the floors and going through their pans. He has discovered that PFOA is [[perfluorooctanoic acid]], used to manufacture [[Teflon]] and used in American homes for nonstick pans. PFAS are commonly found in every American household, and in products as diverse as non- stick cookware, stain resistant furniture and carpets, wrinkle free and water repellant clothing, cosmetics, lubricants, paint, pizza boxes, popcorn bags, and many other everyday products. <ref>https://casaweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/National-PFAS-Receivers-Factsheet.pdf</ref> DuPont has been running tests of the effect of PFOA for decades, finding that it causes cancer and birth defects, but did not make the findings public. They dumped hundreds of gallons of toxic sludge upriver from Tennant's farm. PFOA and similar compounds are [[Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances#Forever chemicals|forever chemicals]], chemicals that do not leave the blood stream [[Bioaccumulation|and slowly accumulate]].\n\nTennant has been shunned by the community for suing their biggest employer, and he and his wife both have cancer. Robert encourages him to accept DuPont's settlement, but Tennant refuses, wanting justice. He tells Robert he and his wife both have cancer. Robert sends the DuPont evidence to the EPA and Department of Justice, among others. The EPA fines DuPont $16.5 million.\n\nRobert, however, is not satisfied; he realizes that the residents of Parkersburg will suffer the effects of the PFOA for the rest of their lives. He seeks [[Monitoring (medicine)|medical monitoring]] for all residents of Parkersburg in one large [[Class action|class-action lawsuit]]. However, DuPont sends a letter notifying residents of the presence of PFOA, thus starting the [[statute of limitations]] and giving any further action only a month to begin.\n\nSince PFOA is not regulated, Robert's team argues that the corporation is liable, as the amount in the water was higher than the one part per billion deemed safe by DuPont's internal documents. In court, DuPont claims their later study found that 150 parts per billion is safe. The locals protest and the story becomes national news. DuPont agrees to settle for $70 million. As DuPont is only required to carry out medical monitoring if scientists prove that PFOA causes the ailments, an independent scientific review is set up. To get data for it, DuPont tells the locals they can get their settlement money after donating blood. Nearly 70,000 people donate to the study. PFOA and PFOS are found in every American person\u2019s blood stream in the parts per billion range, though those concentrations have decreased by 70% for PFOA and 84% for PFOS between 1999 and 2014, which coincides with the end of the production and phase out of PFOA and PFOS in the US2. <ref>https://casaweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/National-PFAS-Receivers-Factsheet.pdf</ref>\n \n\nSeven years pass with no result from the study. Tennant dies and Robert becomes destitute following several pay cuts, straining his marriage. When Tom tells him he needs to take another pay cut, Robert collapses, shaking. Doctors tell Sarah he suffered an [[ischemia]], brought on by stress. Sarah tells Tom to stop making Robert feel like a failure, since he is doing something for people who need help.\n\nThe scientific review contacts Robert and tells him that PFOA causes multiple cancers and other diseases. At dinner with his family, Robert is informed that DuPont is reneging on the entire agreement. Robert decides to take each defendant's case to DuPont, one at a time. He wins the first three multimillion-dollar settlements against DuPont, and DuPont settles the class action for $671 million.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Mark Ruffalo]] as [[Robert Bilott]]\n*

When ''Dark Waters'' was released on November 12, DuPont's stock price dropped even further by 7.15 points from 72.18 to 65.03. While the portfolio is now a part of [[Chemours]] and the companies settled the public health lawsuits referenced in the film, Chemours sued DuPont, alleging that the former parent company saddled it with onerous liabilities when it failed to prepare financial projections in good faith. Chemours estimated that it would need to pay over $200 million to address environmental damages in North Carolina caused by another PFAS manufacturing facility in that region. (The prior settlement in both West Virginia and Ohio cost $671 million, which was split between the two companies.)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/01/09/heres-why-dupont-fell-405-in-2019.aspx|title=Here's Why DuPont Fell 40.5% in 2019|last=Chatsko|first=Maxx|date=January 9, 2020|website=Fool|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200402145208/https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/01/09/heres-why-dupont-fell-405-in-2019.aspx|archive-date=April 2, 2020|access-date=January 24, 2020}}</ref>\n\nDuPont CEO Marc Doyle, executives, and investors argued in internal statements that much of the movie was not based in fact and DuPont was misconstrued to fit the role of the enemy.

The film received positive reviews from critics and has grossed $21 million.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Robert Bilott]] is a corporate defense lawyer from [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] working for law firm [[Taft Stettinius & Hollister]]. Farmer Wilbur Tennant, who knows Robert's grandmother, asks Robert to investigate a number of unexplained deaths in [[Parkersburg, West Virginia]]. Tennant connects the deaths to the chemical manufacturing corporation [[DuPont (1802-2017)|DuPont]], and gives Robert a large case of videotapes.\n\nRobert visits the Tennants' farm, where he learns that 190 cattle have died with unusual medical conditions such as bloated organs, blackened teeth, and tumors. DuPont attorney Phil Donnelly tells him he is not aware of the case but will help out in any way he can. Robert files a small suit so he can gain information through [[legal discovery]] of the chemicals dumped on the site. When he finds nothing useful in the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] report, he realizes the chemicals might not be regulated by the EPA.\n\nRobert confronts Phil at an industry event, leading to an angry exchange. DuPont sends Robert hundreds of boxes, hoping to bury the evidence. Robert finds numerous references to PFOA, a chemical with no references in any medical textbook. In the middle of the night, Robert's pregnant wife Sarah finds him tearing the carpet off the floors and going through their pans. He has discovered that PFOA is [[perfluorooctanoic acid]], used to manufacture [[Teflon]] and used in American homes for nonstick pans. PFAS are commonly found in every American household, and in products as diverse as non- stick cookware, stain resistant furniture and carpets, wrinkle free and water repellant clothing, cosmetics, lubricants, paint, pizza boxes, popcorn bags, and many other everyday products. <ref>https://casaweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/National-PFAS-Receivers-Factsheet.pdf</ref> DuPont has been running tests of the effect of PFOA for decades, finding that it causes cancer and birth defects, but did not make the findings public. They dumped hundreds of gallons of toxic sludge upriver from Tennant's farm. PFOA and similar compounds are [[Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances#Forever chemicals|forever chemicals]], chemicals that do not leave the blood stream [[Bioaccumulation|and slowly accumulate]].\n\nTennant has been shunned by the community for suing their biggest employer, and he and his wife both have cancer. Robert encourages him to accept DuPont's settlement, but Tennant refuses, wanting justice. He tells Robert he and his wife both have cancer. Robert sends the DuPont evidence to the EPA and Department of Justice, among others. The EPA fines DuPont $16.5 million.\n\nRobert, however, is not satisfied; he realizes that the residents of Parkersburg will suffer the effects of the PFOA for the rest of their lives. He seeks [[Monitoring (medicine)|medical monitoring]] for all residents of Parkersburg in one large [[Class action|class-action lawsuit]]. However, DuPont sends a letter notifying residents of the presence of PFOA, thus starting the [[statute of limitations]] and giving any further action only a month to begin.\n\nSince PFOA is not regulated, Robert's team argues that the corporation is liable, as the amount in the water was higher than the one part per billion deemed safe by DuPont's internal documents. In court, DuPont claims their later study found that 150 parts per billion is safe. The locals protest and the story becomes national news. DuPont agrees to settle for $70 million. As DuPont is only required to carry out medical monitoring if scientists prove that PFOA causes the ailments, an independent scientific review is set up. To get data for it, DuPont tells the locals they can get their settlement money after donating blood. Nearly 70,000 people donate to the study.\n\nSeven years pass with no result from the study. Tennant dies and Robert becomes destitute following several pay cuts, straining his marriage. When Tom tells him he needs to take another pay cut, Robert collapses, shaking. Doctors tell Sarah he suffered an [[ischemia]], brought on by stress. Sarah tells Tom to stop making Robert feel like a failure, since he is doing something for people who need help.\n\nThe scientific review contacts Robert and tells him that PFOA causes multiple cancers and other diseases. At dinner with his family, Robert is informed that DuPont is reneging on the entire agreement. Robert decides to take each defendant's case to DuPont, one at a time. He wins the first three multimillion-dollar settlements against DuPont, and DuPont settles the class action for $671 million.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Mark Ruffalo]] as [[Robert Bilott]]\n*

When ''Dark Waters'' was released on November 12, DuPont's stock price dropped even further by 7.15 points from 72.18 to 65.03. While the portfolio is now a part of [[Chemours]] and the companies settled the public health lawsuits referenced in the film, Chemours sued DuPont, alleging that the former parent company saddled it with onerous liabilities when it failed to prepare financial projections in good faith. Chemours estimated that it would need to pay over $200 million to address environmental damages in North Carolina caused by another PFAS manufacturing facility in that region. (The prior settlement in both West Virginia and Ohio cost $671 million, which was split between the two companies.)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/01/09/heres-why-dupont-fell-405-in-2019.aspx|title=Here's Why DuPont Fell 40.5% in 2019|last=Chatsko|first=Maxx|date=January 9, 2020|website=Fool|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200402145208/https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/01/09/heres-why-dupont-fell-405-in-2019.aspx|archive-date=April 2, 2020|access-date=January 24, 2020}}</ref>\n\nDuPont CEO Marc Doyle, executives, and investors argued in internal statements that much of the movie was not based in fact and DuPont was misconstrued to fit the role of the enemy.

The Liberal dominance ended in [[1984 Canadian federal election|1984]] as [[Brian Mulroney]], who is from this area, was able to gather Quebec nationalist support and sweep the region in 1984 and [[1988 Canadian federal election|1988]]. With the advent of the nationalist [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] in 1993, nationalist support left the Tories, and this area became a traditional Bloc stronghold. This is true except for the [[Chicoutimi, Quebec|Chicoutimi]] area which has voted federalist with [[Andr\u00e9 Harvey]] running as a [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] and winning in 1997, and running as a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] and winning in 2000. The Bloc swept the region in 2004, but the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]] picked up a seat here in [[2006 Canadian federal election|2006]] and weakened the Bloc's grip on the remaining seats as Liberal support collapsed. In 2011, another regional sweep gave four of the five seats to the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democrats]], shutting out the Bloc and leaving the Conservatives with one of their two seats. In the 2015 election, the NDP lost all but one of its seat in the region, while the Bloc managed a comeback in the C\u00f4te-Nord region, the Liberals won one seat in Chicoutimi and the Conservatives won one seat in the southwestern part of the region near Quebec City.\n\n=== Votes by party throughout time ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Evolution of party standings throughout time\n|-\n!

elections''' have provided the following '''results''' in '''the C\u00f4te-Nord and Saguenay'''.\n\n==Regional Profile==\nThis region used to be traditionally [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]], except for Roberval which has voted for the Social Credit Party. The Liberal dominance ended in [[1984 Canadian federal election|1984]] as [[Brian Mulroney]], who is from this area, was able to gather Quebec nationalist support and sweep the region in 1984 and [[1988 Canadian federal election|1988]]. With the advent of the nationalist [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] in 1993, nationalist support left the Tories, and this area became a traditional Bloc stronghold. This is true except for the [[Chicoutimi, Quebec|Chicoutimi]] area which has voted federalist with [[Andr\u00e9 Harvey]] running as a [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] and winning in 1997, and running as a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] and winning in 2000. The Bloc swept the region in 2004, but the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]] picked up a seat here in [[2006 Canadian federal election|2006]] and weakened the Bloc's grip on the remaining seats as Liberal support collapsed. In 2011, another regional sweep gave four of the five seats to the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democrats]], shutting out the Bloc and leaving the Conservatives with one of their two seats. In the 2015 election, the NDP lost all but one of its seat in the region, while the Bloc managed a comeback in the C\u00f4te-Nord region, the Liberals won one seat in Chicoutimi and the Conservatives won one seat in the southwestern part of the region near Quebec City.\n\n=== Votes by party throughout time ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Evolution of party standings throughout time\n|-\n!

[[Chicago metropolitan area|Chicagoland]], Chicago's [[metropolitan area]], encompasses over 65% of the state's population. The [[Port of Chicago]] connects the state to international ports via two main routes: from the [[Great Lakes]], via the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]], to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and from the [[Great Lakes]] to the [[Mississippi River]], via the [[Illinois Waterway]] to the [[Illinois River]]. The Mississippi River, the [[Ohio River]], and the [[Wabash River]] form parts of the boundaries of Illinois. For decades, Chicago's [[O'Hare International Airport]] has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a [[bellwether]] both in [[Will it play in Peoria?|social and cultural terms]]<ref name=\"so\" /> and, through the 1980s, in [[swing states|politics]].\n\nThe capital of Illinois is [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]], which is located in the central part of the state. Although today Illinois's largest population center is in its northeast, the state's European population grew first in the west as the French settled lands near the Mississippi River, when the region was known as [[Illinois Country]] and was part of [[New France]]. Following the [[American Revolutionary War]], American settlers began arriving from [[Kentucky]] in the 1780s via the Ohio River, and the population grew from south to north.

[[Northern Illinois]] is dominated by [[Chicago metropolitan area]], or Chicagoland, which is the city of Chicago and its suburbs, and the adjoining exurban area into which the metropolis is expanding. As defined by the federal government, the Chicago metro area includes several counties in Illinois, [[Indiana]], and [[Wisconsin]], and has a population of over 9.8&nbsp;million. Chicago itself is a cosmopolitan city, densely populated, industrialized, the transportation hub of the nation, and settled by a wide variety of ethnic groups. The city of [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]], Illinois's third-largest city and center of the state's fourth largest metropolitan area, sits along Interstates [[Interstate 39|39]] and [[Interstate 90|90]] some {{convert|75|mi|km}} northwest of Chicago. The [[Quad Cities]] region, located along the [[Mississippi River]] in northern Illinois, had a population of 381,342 in 2011.\n\nThe midsection of Illinois is the second major division, called [[Central Illinois]]. It is an area of mainly [[prairie]] and known as the Heart of Illinois. It is characterized by small towns and medium\u2013small cities. The western section (west of the Illinois River) was originally part of the [[Military Tract of 1812]] and forms the conspicuous western bulge of the state. Agriculture, particularly [[maize|corn]] and [[soybean]]s, as well as educational institutions and manufacturing centers, figure prominently in Central Illinois. Cities include [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]]; [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]], the state capital; [[Quincy, Illinois|Quincy]]; [[Decatur, Illinois|Decatur]]; [[Bloomington-Normal, Illinois|Bloomington-Normal]]; and [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]]-[[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]].<ref name=\"Nelson\"/>\n\nThe third division is [[Southern Illinois]], comprising the area south of [[U.S. Route 50 in Illinois|U.S. Route 50]], including [[Southern Illinois|Little Egypt]], near the juncture of the [[Mississippi River]] and [[Ohio River]]. Southern Illinois is the site of the ancient city of [[Cahokia]], as well as the site of the first state capital at [[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]], which today is separated from the rest of the state by the Mississippi River.<ref name=\"Nelson\"/><ref name=\"Horsley\">{{cite book |last=Horsley |first=A.

Bush]] became the first Republican to win the presidency without carrying either Illinois or [[Vermont]]. Local politician and Chicago resident [[Barack Obama]] easily won the state's 21 electoral votes in [[2008 United States presidential election in Illinois|2008]], with 61.9% of the vote. In 2010, incumbent governor [[Pat Quinn (politician)|Pat Quinn]] was re-elected with 47% of the vote, while Republican Mark Kirk was elected to the Senate with 48% of the vote. In 2012, President Obama easily carried Illinois again, with 58% to Republican candidate [[Mitt Romney]]'s 41%.

In [[2018 Illinois gubernatorial election|2018]], Democrat [[J. B. Pritzker|JB Pritzker]] defeated the incumbent Bruce Rauner for the governorship with 54% of the vote.\n\n===History of corruption===\n\n{{main|Political corruption in Illinois}}\n\nPolitics in the state have been infamous for highly visible corruption cases, as well as for crusading reformers, such as governors [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] and [[James R. Thompson]]. In 2006, former governor [[George Ryan]] was convicted of racketeering and bribery, leading to a six-and-a-half-year prison sentence. In 2008, then-Governor [[Rod Blagojevich]] was served with a criminal complaint on corruption charges, stemming from allegations that he conspired to sell the vacated Senate seat left by President [[Barack Obama]] to the highest bidder. Subsequently, on December 7, 2011, [[Rod Blagojevich]] was sentenced to 14 years in prison for those charges, as well as perjury while testifying during the case, totaling 18 convictions. Blagojevich was impeached and convicted by the legislature, resulting in his removal from office. In the late 20th century, Congressman [[Dan Rostenkowski]] was imprisoned for mail fraud; former governor and federal judge [[Otto Kerner, Jr.]] was imprisoned for bribery; Secretary of State [[Paul Powell (politician)|Paul Powell]] was investigated and found to have gained great wealth through bribes, and State Auditor of Public Accounts (Comptroller) [[Orville Hodge]] was imprisoned for embezzlement. In 1912, William Lorimer, the GOP boss of Chicago, was expelled from the U.S. Senate for bribery and in 1921, Governor [[Len Small]] was found to have defrauded the state of a million dollars.<ref name=\"Biles\"/><ref name=\"Horsley\"/><ref>{{cite book |title= Grafters and Goo Goos: corruption and reform in Chicago, 1833\u20132003|last= Merriner|first= James L.|year= 2004|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|location= Carbondale|isbn= 978-0-8093-2571-9|oclc= 52720998}}</ref>\n\n===U.S. presidential elections===\n\n{{Main|United States presidential elections in Illinois}}\n\nIllinois has shown a strong presence in presidential elections. Three presidents have claimed Illinois as their political base when running for president: [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Ulysses S. Grant]], and most recently [[Barack Obama]]. Lincoln was born in [[Kentucky]], but he moved to Illinois at age 21. He served in the [[Illinois General Assembly|General Assembly]] and represented the [[Illinois's 7th congressional district|7th congressional district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] before his election to the presidency in 1860. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was born in [[Ohio]] and had a military career that precluded settling down, but on the eve of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and approaching middle age, he moved to Illinois and thus utilized the state as his home and political base when running for president. [[Barack Obama]] was born in [[Hawaii]] and made Illinois his home after graduating from [[law school]], and later represented Illinois in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. He then became president in 2008, running as a candidate from his Illinois base.\n\n[[Ronald Reagan]] was born in Illinois, in the city of [[Tampico, Illinois|Tampico]], raised in [[Dixon, Illinois]], and educated at [[Eureka College]], outside [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]]. Reagan later moved to [[California]] during his young adulthood. He then became an actor, and later became [[Governor of California|California's Governor]] before being elected president.\n\n[[Hillary Clinton]] was born and raised in the suburbs of Chicago and became the first woman to represent a major political party in the general election of the U.S. presidency. Clinton ran from a platform based in [[New York (state)|New York State]].\n\n===African-American U.S. senators===\n\n[[List of African-American United States Senators|Nine African-Americans]] have served as members of the [[United States Senate]]. Three of them have represented Illinois, the most of any single state: [[Carol Moseley Braun|Carol Moseley-Braun]], [[Barack Obama]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/history/h_multi_sections_and_teasers/Photo_Exhibit_African_American_Senators.htm |title=U.S. Senate: Art & History Home |publisher=Senate.gov |accessdate=February 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180702035451/https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/history/h_multi_sections_and_teasers/Photo_Exhibit_African_American_Senators.htm |archive-date=July 2, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> and [[Roland Burris]], who was appointed to replace Obama after his election to the presidency. Moseley-Braun was the first African-American woman to become a U.S. Senator.\n\n===Political families===\n\nThree families from Illinois have played particularly prominent roles in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], gaining both statewide and national fame.\n\n====Stevenson====\n\nThe [[Stevenson family]], initially rooted in central Illinois and later based in the Chicago metropolitan area, has provided four generations of Illinois officeholders.\n* [[Adlai Stevenson I]] (1835\u20131914) was a Vice President of the United States, as well as a [[Congressman]]\n* [[Lewis Stevenson (politician)|Lewis Stevenson]] (1868\u20131929), son of Adlai, served as [[Illinois Secretary of State]].\n* [[Adlai Stevenson II]] (1900\u20131965), son of Lewis, served as [[Governor of Illinois]] and as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations; he was also the Democratic party's presidential nominee in [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] and [[1956 United States presidential election|1956]], losing both elections to [[Dwight Eisenhower]].\n* [[Adlai Stevenson III]] (1930\u2013), son of Adlai II, served ten years as a [[United States Senator]].\n\n====Daley====\n\nThe [[Daley family]]'s powerbase was in Chicago.\n* [[Richard J. Daley]] (1902\u20131976) served as [[Mayor of Chicago]] from 1955 to his death.\n* [[Richard M. Daley]] (1942\u2013), son of Richard J, was Chicago's longest-serving mayor, in office from 1989 to 2011.\n* [[William M. Daley]] (1948\u2013), another son of Richard J, is a former [[White House Chief of Staff]] and has served in a variety of appointed positions.\n\n====Pritzker====\n\nThe [[Pritzker family]] is based in Chicago and have played important roles both in the private and public sectors.\n* [[Jay Pritzker]] (1922\u20131999), co-founder of [[Hyatt Hotel]] based in Chicago.\n* [[Penny Pritzker]] (born 1959), 38th [[United States Secretary of Commerce]] under President [[Barack Obama]].\n* [[J.B. Pritzker]] (born 1965), current and 43rd [[governor of Illinois]] and co-founder of the Pritzker Group.\n\n==Education==\n===Illinois State Board of education===\n\n{{main|Illinois State Board of Education}}\n\nThe Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) is autonomous of the governor and the state legislature, and administers [[public education]] in the state. Local municipalities and their respective [[school district]]s operate individual public schools, but the ISBE audits performance of public schools with the [[Illinois School Report Card]]. The ISBE also makes recommendations to state leaders concerning education spending and policies.\n\n===Primary and secondary schools===\n\n{{see also|List of school districts in Illinois|List of high schools in Illinois}}\n\nEducation is compulsory from ages 7 to 17 in Illinois. Schools are commonly, but not exclusively, divided into three tiers of primary and secondary education: elementary school, [[middle school]] or [[Middle school|junior high school]], and high school. District territories are often complex in structure. Many areas in the state are actually located in ''two'' school districts\u2014one for high school, the other for elementary and middle schools. And such districts do not necessarily share boundaries. A given high school may have several elementary districts that feed into it, yet some of those feeder districts may themselves feed into multiple high school districts.\n\n===Colleges and universities===\n\n{{mainlist|List of colleges and universities in Illinois}}\n[[File:MainLibrary Urbana Illinois 4582.jpg|thumb|The [[Main Library (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)|Main Library]] of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]] is home to [[The Rare Book & Manuscript Library (University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign)|the Rare Book & Manuscript Library]].]]\n\nUsing the criterion established by [[the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]], there are eleven \"National Universities\" in the state. {{As of|2010|8|19}}, six of these rank in the \"first tier\" (that is, the top quartile) among the top 500 National Universities in the United States, as determined by the ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' rankings: the [[University of Chicago]] (3), [[Northwestern University]] (10), the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]] (41), [[Loyola University Chicago]] (89), the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] (108), [[DePaul University]] (123), [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] (129), [[Illinois State University]] (149), [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]] (153), and [[Northern Illinois University]] (194).<ref name=\"usnews\">{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/national-universities-rankings/state+IL|title=Best Colleges 2010\u2014National Universities Rankings|date=August 19, 2009|accessdate=May 31, 2016|website=[[U.S. News & World Report]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105090520/http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/national-universities-rankings/state+IL|archive-date=January 5, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe University of Chicago is continuously ranked as one of the world's top ten universities on various independent university rankings, and its [[Booth School of Business]], along with Northwestern's [[Kellogg School of Management]] consistently rank within the top five graduate business schools in the country and top ten globally.

Currently there is trackwork on the Chicago\u2013St. Louis line to bring the maximum speed up to {{convert|110|mph|abbr=on}}, which would reduce the trip time by an hour and a half. Nearly every North American railway meets at Chicago, making it the largest and most active rail hub in the country. Extensive commuter rail is provided in the city proper and some immediate suburbs by the [[Chicago Transit Authority]]'s [[Chicago \"L\"|'L']] system. One of the largest suburban commuter rail system in the United States, operated by [[Metra]], uses existing rail lines to provide direct commuter rail access for hundreds of suburbs to the city and beyond.\n\nIn addition to the state's rail lines, the [[Mississippi River]] and [[Illinois River]] provide major transportation routes for the state's agricultural interests. [[Lake Michigan]] gives Illinois access to the Atlantic Ocean by way of the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]].\n\n====Interstate highway system====\n\n{{Main|List of Interstate Highways in Illinois}}\n\nThe Interstate Highways in Illinois are all segments of the [[Interstate Highway System]] that are owned and maintained by the state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/interstate/faq.cfm|title=Interstate Frequently Asked Questions\u201450th Anniversary\u2014Interstate System\u2014Highway History\u2014Federal Highway Administration|website=www.fhwa.dot.gov|access-date=May 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIllinois has the distinction of having the most primary (two-digit) interstates pass through it among all the 50 states with 13.

The [[Port of Chicago]] connects the state to international ports via two main routes: from the [[Great Lakes]], via the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]], to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and from the [[Great Lakes]] to the [[Mississippi River]], via the [[Illinois Waterway]] to the [[Illinois River]]. The Mississippi River, the [[Ohio River]], and the [[Wabash River]] form parts of the boundaries of Illinois. For decades, Chicago's [[O'Hare International Airport]] has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a [[bellwether]] both in [[Will it play in Peoria?|social and cultural terms]]<ref name=\"so\" /> and, through the 1980s, in [[swing states|politics]].\n\nThe capital of Illinois is [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]], which is located in the central part of the state. Although today Illinois's largest population center is in its northeast, the state's European population grew first in the west as the French settled lands near the Mississippi River, when the region was known as [[Illinois Country]] and was part of [[New France]]. Following the [[American Revolutionary War]], American settlers began arriving from [[Kentucky]] in the 1780s via the Ohio River, and the population grew from south to north. In 1818, Illinois achieved [[List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union|statehood]]. Following increased commercial activity in the Great Lakes after the construction of the [[Erie Canal]], Chicago was founded in the 1830s on the banks of the [[Chicago River]] at one of the few natural harbors on the southern section of [[Lake Michigan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chipublib.org/digital/lake/CFDHarbor.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516035020/http://www.chipublib.org/digital/lake/CFDHarbor.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 16, 2008|title=Page Not Found\u2014Chicago Public Library|date=May 16, 2008}}</ref> [[John Deere (inventor)|John Deere]]'s invention of the self-scouring [[plough|steel plow]] turned Illinois's rich [[prairie]] into some of the world's most productive and valuable farmland, attracting [[immigrant]] farmers from [[German American|Germany]] and [[Swedish American|Sweden]].

[[Northern Illinois]] is dominated by [[Chicago metropolitan area]], or Chicagoland, which is the city of Chicago and its suburbs, and the adjoining exurban area into which the metropolis is expanding. As defined by the federal government, the Chicago metro area includes several counties in Illinois, [[Indiana]], and [[Wisconsin]], and has a population of over 9.8&nbsp;million. Chicago itself is a cosmopolitan city, densely populated, industrialized, the transportation hub of the nation, and settled by a wide variety of ethnic groups. The city of [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]], Illinois's third-largest city and center of the state's fourth largest metropolitan area, sits along Interstates [[Interstate 39|39]] and [[Interstate 90|90]] some {{convert|75|mi|km}} northwest of Chicago. The [[Quad Cities]] region, located along the [[Mississippi River]] in northern Illinois, had a population of 381,342 in 2011.\n\nThe midsection of Illinois is the second major division, called [[Central Illinois]]. It is an area of mainly [[prairie]] and known as the Heart of Illinois. It is characterized by small towns and medium\u2013small cities. The western section (west of the Illinois River) was originally part of the [[Military Tract of 1812]] and forms the conspicuous western bulge of the state. Agriculture, particularly [[maize|corn]] and [[soybean]]s, as well as educational institutions and manufacturing centers, figure prominently in Central Illinois. Cities include [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]]; [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]], the state capital; [[Quincy, Illinois|Quincy]]; [[Decatur, Illinois|Decatur]]; [[Bloomington-Normal, Illinois|Bloomington-Normal]]; and [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]]-[[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]].<ref name=\"Nelson\"/>\n\nThe third division is [[Southern Illinois]], comprising the area south of [[U.S. Route 50 in Illinois|U.S. Route 50]], including [[Southern Illinois|Little Egypt]], near the juncture of the [[Mississippi River]] and [[Ohio River]]. Southern Illinois is the site of the ancient city of [[Cahokia]], as well as the site of the first state capital at [[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]], which today is separated from the rest of the state by the Mississippi River.<ref name=\"Nelson\"/><ref name=\"Horsley\">{{cite book |last=Horsley |first=A.

Bush]] became the first Republican to win the presidency without carrying either Illinois or [[Vermont]]. Local politician and Chicago resident [[Barack Obama]] easily won the state's 21 electoral votes in [[2008 United States presidential election in Illinois|2008]], with 61.9% of the vote. In 2010, incumbent Governor [[Pat Quinn (politician)|Pat Quinn]] was re-elected with 47% of the vote, while Republican Mark Kirk was elected to the Senate with 48% of the vote. In 2012, President Obama easily carried Illinois again, with 58% to Republican candidate [[Mitt Romney]]'s 41%.

In [[2018 Illinois gubernatorial election|2018]], Democrat [[J. B. Pritzker|JB Pritzker]] defeated the incumbent Bruce Rauner for the governorship with 54% of the vote.\n\n===History of corruption===\n\n{{main|Political corruption in Illinois}}\n\nPolitics in the state have been infamous for highly visible corruption cases, as well as for crusading reformers, such as governors [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] and [[James R. Thompson]]. In 2006, former Governor [[George Ryan]] was convicted of racketeering and bribery, leading to a six-and-a-half-year prison sentence. In 2008, then-Governor [[Rod Blagojevich]] was served with a criminal complaint on corruption charges, stemming from allegations that he conspired to sell the vacated Senate seat left by President [[Barack Obama]] to the highest bidder. Subsequently, on December 7, 2011, [[Rod Blagojevich]] was sentenced to 14 years in prison for those charges, as well as perjury while testifying during the case, totaling 18 convictions. Blagojevich was impeached and convicted by the legislature, resulting in his removal from office. In the late 20th century, Congressman [[Dan Rostenkowski]] was imprisoned for mail fraud; former governor and federal judge [[Otto Kerner, Jr.]] was imprisoned for bribery; Secretary of State [[Paul Powell (politician)|Paul Powell]] was investigated and found to have gained great wealth through bribes, and State Auditor of Public Accounts (Comptroller) [[Orville Hodge]] was imprisoned for embezzlement. In 1912, William Lorimer, the GOP boss of Chicago, was expelled from the U.S. Senate for bribery and in 1921, Governor [[Len Small]] was found to have defrauded the state of a million dollars.<ref name=\"Biles\"/><ref name=\"Horsley\"/><ref>{{cite book |title= Grafters and Goo Goos: corruption and reform in Chicago, 1833\u20132003|last= Merriner|first= James L.|year= 2004|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|location= Carbondale|isbn= 978-0-8093-2571-9|oclc= 52720998}}</ref>\n\n===U.S. presidential elections===\n\n{{Main|United States presidential elections in Illinois}}\n\nIllinois has shown a strong presence in presidential elections. Three presidents have claimed Illinois as their political base when running for president: [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Ulysses S. Grant]], and most recently [[Barack Obama]]. Lincoln was born in [[Kentucky]], but he moved to Illinois at age 21. He served in the [[Illinois General Assembly|General Assembly]] and represented the [[Illinois's 7th congressional district|7th congressional district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] before his election to the presidency in 1860. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was born in [[Ohio]] and had a military career that precluded settling down, but on the eve of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and approaching middle age, he moved to Illinois and thus utilized the state as his home and political base when running for President. [[Barack Obama]] was born in [[Hawaii]] and made Illinois his home after graduating from [[law school]], and later represented Illinois in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. He then became president in 2008, running as a candidate from his Illinois base.\n\n[[Ronald Reagan]] was born in Illinois, in the city of [[Tampico, Illinois|Tampico]], raised in [[Dixon, Illinois]], and educated at [[Eureka College]], outside [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]]. Reagan later moved to [[California]] during his young adulthood. He then became an actor, and later became [[Governor of California|California's Governor]] before being elected president.\n\n[[Hillary Clinton]] was born and raised in the suburbs of Chicago and became the first woman to represent a major political party in the general election of the U.S. presidency. Clinton ran from a platform based in [[New York (state)|New York State]].\n\n===African-American U.S. senators===\n\n[[List of African-American United States Senators|Nine African-Americans]] have served as members of the [[United States Senate]]. Three of them have represented Illinois, the most of any single state: [[Carol Moseley Braun|Carol Moseley-Braun]], [[Barack Obama]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/history/h_multi_sections_and_teasers/Photo_Exhibit_African_American_Senators.htm |title=U.S. Senate: Art & History Home |publisher=Senate.gov |accessdate=February 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180702035451/https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/history/h_multi_sections_and_teasers/Photo_Exhibit_African_American_Senators.htm |archive-date=July 2, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> and [[Roland Burris]], who was appointed to replace Obama after his election to the presidency. Moseley-Braun was the first African-American woman to become a U.S. Senator.\n\n===Political families===\n\nThree families from Illinois have played particularly prominent roles in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], gaining both statewide and national fame.\n\n====Stevenson====\n\nThe [[Stevenson family]], initially rooted in central Illinois and later based in the Chicago metropolitan area, has provided four generations of Illinois officeholders.\n* [[Adlai Stevenson I]] (1835\u20131914) was a Vice President of the United States, as well as a [[Congressman]]\n* [[Lewis Stevenson (politician)|Lewis Stevenson]] (1868\u20131929), son of Adlai, served as [[Illinois Secretary of State]].\n* [[Adlai Stevenson II]] (1900\u20131965), son of Lewis, served as [[Governor of Illinois]] and as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations; he was also the Democratic party's presidential nominee in [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] and [[1956 United States presidential election|1956]], losing both elections to [[Dwight Eisenhower]].\n* [[Adlai Stevenson III]] (1930\u2013), son of Adlai II, served ten years as a [[United States Senator]].\n\n====Daley====\n\nThe [[Daley family]]'s powerbase was in Chicago.\n* [[Richard J. Daley]] (1902\u20131976) served as [[Mayor of Chicago]] from 1955 to his death.\n* [[Richard M. Daley]] (1942\u2013), son of Richard J, was Chicago's longest-serving mayor, in office from 1989 to 2011.\n* [[William M. Daley]] (1948\u2013), another son of Richard J, is a former [[White House Chief of Staff]] and has served in a variety of appointed positions.\n\n====Pritzker====\n\nThe [[Pritzker family]] is based in Chicago and have played important roles both in the private and public sectors.\n* [[Jay Pritzker]] (1922-1999), co-founder of [[Hyatt Hotel]] based in Chicago.\n* [[Penny Pritzker]] (1959- ), 38th [[United States Secretary of Commerce]] under President [[Barack Obama]].\n* [[J.B. Pritzker]] (1965- ), current and 43rd [[Governor of Illinois]] and co-founder of the Pritzker Group.\n\n==Education==\n===Illinois State Board of education===\n\n{{main|Illinois State Board of Education}}\n\nThe Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) is autonomous of the governor and the state legislature, and administers [[public education]] in the state. Local municipalities and their respective [[school district]]s operate individual public schools, but the ISBE audits performance of public schools with the [[Illinois School Report Card]]. The ISBE also makes recommendations to state leaders concerning education spending and policies.\n\n===Primary and secondary schools===\n\n{{see also|List of school districts in Illinois|List of high schools in Illinois}}\n\nEducation is compulsory from ages 7 to 17 in Illinois. Schools are commonly, but not exclusively, divided into three tiers of primary and secondary education: elementary school, [[middle school]] or [[Middle school|junior high school]], and high school. District territories are often complex in structure. Many areas in the state are actually located in ''two'' school districts\u2014one for high school, the other for elementary and middle schools. And such districts do not necessarily share boundaries. A given high school may have several elementary districts that feed into it, yet some of those feeder districts may themselves feed into multiple high school districts.\n\n===Colleges and universities===\n\n{{mainlist|List of colleges and universities in Illinois}}\n[[File:MainLibrary Urbana Illinois 4582.jpg|thumb|The [[Main Library (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)|Main Library]] of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]] is home to [[The Rare Book & Manuscript Library (University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign)|the Rare Book & Manuscript Library]].]]\n\nUsing the criterion established by [[the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]], there are eleven \"National Universities\" in the state. {{As of|2010|8|19}}, six of these rank in the \"first tier\" (that is, the top quartile) among the top 500 National Universities in the United States, as determined by the ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' rankings: the [[University of Chicago]] (3), [[Northwestern University]] (10), the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]] (41), [[Loyola University Chicago]] (89), the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] (108), [[DePaul University]] (123), [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] (129), [[Illinois State University]] (149), [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]] (153), and [[Northern Illinois University]] (194).<ref name=\"usnews\">{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/national-universities-rankings/state+IL|title=Best Colleges 2010\u2014National Universities Rankings|date=August 19, 2009|accessdate=May 31, 2016|website=[[U.S. News & World Report]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105090520/http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/national-universities-rankings/state+IL|archive-date=January 5, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe University of Chicago is continuously ranked as one of the world's top ten universities on various independent university rankings, and its [[Booth School of Business]], along with Northwestern's [[Kellogg School of Management]] consistently rank within the top five graduate business schools in the country and top ten globally.

Currently there is trackwork on the Chicago\u2013St. Louis line to bring the maximum speed up to {{convert|110|mph|abbr=on}}, which would reduce the trip time by an hour and a half. Nearly every North American railway meets at Chicago, making it the largest and most active rail hub in the country. Extensive commuter rail is provided in the city proper and some immediate suburbs by the [[Chicago Transit Authority]]'s [[Chicago \"L\"|'L']] system. One of the largest suburban commuter rail system in the United States, operated by [[Metra]], uses existing rail lines to provide direct commuter rail access for hundreds of suburbs to the city and beyond.\n\nIn addition to the state's rail lines, the [[Mississippi River]] and [[Illinois River]] provide major transportation routes for the state's agricultural interests. [[Lake Michigan]] gives Illinois access to the Atlantic Ocean by way of the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]].\n\n====Interstate highway system====\n\n{{Main|List of Interstate Highways in Illinois}}\n\nThe Interstate Highways in Illinois are all segments of the [[Interstate Highway System]] that are owned and maintained by the state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/interstate/faq.cfm|title=Interstate Frequently Asked Questions\u201450th Anniversary\u2014Interstate System\u2014Highway History\u2014Federal Highway Administration|website=www.fhwa.dot.gov|access-date=May 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIllinois has the distinction of having the most primary (two-digit) interstates pass through it among all the 50 states with 13.
