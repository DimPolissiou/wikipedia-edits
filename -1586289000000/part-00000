The series is a bake-off competition in the style of [[reality television]], where three amateur bakers compete to replicate complicated cakes and confectionery in order to win a $10,000 cash prize and a \"nailed it\" trophy. A second season was released on June 29, 2018. A holiday season, dubbed ''Nailed It! Holiday!'', was released on December 7, 2018. The third season was released on May 17, 2019. A second holiday season of ''Nailed It! Holiday!'' was released on November 22, 2019.<ref>{{cite news|title=Netflix Renews Nailed It! Holiday!

Competitors take part in two challenges over the course of the 35-minute episodes.\n\nThe first challenge is called \"Baker's Choice\", where the contestants pick one of three existing confectionery treats and try to recreate it. The winner of this challenge gets a special prize and is allowed to wear a golden chef's hat.\n\nIn the second challenge, \"Nail It or Fail It\", contestants have two hours to recreate a complicated cake from scratch. They each receive a \"Panic Button\" which allows them to get three minutes of assistance from one of the judges. The worst-performing baker from the first challenge gets a second button to distract the other bakers - the specific function varies depending on the episode, but normally involves Nicole annoying the bakers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Worboys|first=Audrey|title=LMFAO, There's A New Netflix Show Exclusively For Cake Fails|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/audreyworboys/netflix-cake-fail-show-nailed-it|work=[[BuzzFeed]]|date=10 March 2018|accessdate=12 March 2018}}</ref> The three judges decide on the winning cake based upon presentation and taste.

Competitors take part in two challenges over the course of the 35-minute episodes.\n\nThe first challenge is called \"Baker's Choice\", where the contestants pick one of three existing confectionery treats and try to recreate it. The winner of this challenge gets a special prize and is allowed to wear a golden chef's hat.\n\nIn the second challenge, \"Nail It or Fail It\", contestants have two hours to recreate a complicated cake from scratch. They each receive a \"Panic Button\" which allows them to get three minutes of assistance from one of the judges. The worst-performing baker from the first challenge gets a second button to distract the other bakers - the specific function varies depending on the episode, but normally involves Nicole annoying the bakers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Worboys|first=Audrey|title=LMFAO, There's A New Netflix Show Exclusively For Cake Fails|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/audreyworboys/netflix-cake-fail-show-nailed-it|work=[[BuzzFeed]]|date=10 March 2018|accessdate=12 March 2018}}</ref> The three judges decide on the winning cake based upon presentation and taste.
