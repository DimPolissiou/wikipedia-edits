The series takes place in a fictional universe, the same world as Toriyama's previous series ''[[Dr. Slump]]'', and follows the adventures of [[Goku|Son Goku]] during his boyhood years as he trains in martial arts and explores a fantastical version of [[Earth]] (\u5730\u7403 ''Chiky\u016b'') in search of the seven orbs known as the Dragon Balls that are used to summon a wish-granting dragon. The tone of the series becomes more action oriented and less comedic when Goku reaches adulthood, as he and his allies would find themselves defending Earth against various threats, overcoming seemingly insurmountable opponents and eventually emerging victorious against progressively more powerful foes.\n\nDuring the course of the story, Goku encounters allies such as [[Bulma]], [[Master Roshi]], and [[Trunks (Dragon Ball)|Trunks]], rivals such as [[Tien Shinhan]], [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]], and [[Vegeta]], and villains such as [[Frieza]], [[Cell (Dragon Ball)|Cell]] and [[Majin Buu]]. Goku's group of associates, known as the {{nihongo4|''Dragon Team''|\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0|Doragon Ch\u012bmu}}{{gnr|ch|165}}, bolster its ranks throughout the series with the addition of former enemies and new heroes. The group is also known in Japanese as the {{nihongo4|''Z Fighters''|Z\u6226\u58eb|Zetto Senshi}}<ref>[https://dokkan.game-db.org/linkskill/45/ \u3010\u30c9\u30c3\u30ab\u30f3\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u3011Z\u6226\u58eb/\u30ea\u30f3\u30af\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> or TEAM \"Z\"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxR6kjj7_-c Team Z Song (Dragon Ball Z Resurrection F) - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> in other media, and in the English dub of ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' as the Earth's Special Forces.<ref>''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' episode 122, \"Mystery Revealed\"</ref> \n\nWhile many of the characters are humans with [[superhuman]] strength and/or [[supernatural]] abilities, the cast also includes [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals, [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] lifeforms, and even [[deity|deities]] who govern the world and the universe. The series also includes depictions of the [[afterlife]] and [[Alternate history#Time travel as a means of creating historical divergences|time travel as a means of creating historical divergences]]. ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]'' in particular expanded the setting of the series to include [[Parallel universes in fiction#Fantasy|parallel universe]]s; Universe 7, or the Seventh Universe in the English dub, is designated as the universe where the vast majority of the ''Dragon Ball'' series takes place.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Creation and conception==\nEarth, known as the Dragon World (\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9) and designated as \"Planet 4032-877\" by the celestial hierarchy, is the main setting for the entire Dragon Ball series, as well as related media such as ''[[Dr. Slump]]'', ''[[Nekomajin]]'', and ''[[Jaco the Galactic Patrolman]]''. It is mainly inhabited by Earthlings (\u5730\u7403\u4eba ''Chiky\u016bjin''), a term used inclusively to refer to all of the intelligent races native to the planet, including humans, anthropomorphic beings, and monsters. Earthlings play a predominant role in almost every media in the Dragon Ball franchise, a result of Earth's pride of place as the series' primary setting. Starting from the ''Dragon Ball Z'' series, various [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial species]] such as the Saiyans (\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba ''Saiya-jin'') and [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Namekians|Namekians]] (\u30ca\u30e1\u30c3\u30af\u661f\u4eba ''Namekku-seijin'') have played a more prominent role in franchise media.\n\nAkira Toriyama initially based most of the characters on those of the Chinese novel ''[[Journey to the West]]'',<ref name=\"Manga Design\">{{cite book |title=Manga Design |chapter=Akira Toriyama |first=Julius |last=Wiedemann |editor=Amano Masanao|publisher=[[Taschen]] |date=2004-09-25 |page=372 |isbn=3-8228-2591-3}}</ref><ref name=\"AnimeEncyc\">{{cite book |author=Clements, Jonathan |authorlink=Jonathan Clements |author2=[[Helen McCarthy]]  |title=The Anime Encyclopedia: A Guide to Japanese Animation Since 1917 |date=2001-09-01 |publisher=Stone Bridge Press |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=1-880656-64-7 |oclc=47255331 |pages=101\u2013102 |edition=1st}}</ref> [[Goku]] being [[Sun Wukong]], [[Bulma]] as [[Tang Sanzang]], [[#Oolong|Oolong]] as [[Zhu Bajie]] and [[Yamcha]] being [[Sha Wujing]], and redeveloped one of his earlier [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] manga series, ''[[Dragon Boy (manga)|Dragon Boy]]''.<ref name=\"Illustrations\">{{cite book |title=Dragon Ball \u5927\u5168\u96c6 1 Complete Illustrations |year=1995 |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |pages=206\u2013207 |isbn=4-08-782751-8}}</ref> To be creative with the character, Toriyama stated in 1995 that he designed Goku not as a monkey like the ''Journey to the West'' character, but as a human-looking boy with a monkey's tail to give him a distinguishing feature.<ref name=\"StoryGuide\">{{cite book |title=Dragon Ball \u5927\u5168\u96c6 2 Story Guide |year=1995 |publisher=[[Shueisha]]|pages=261\u2013265 |isbn=4-08-782752-6}}</ref> However, in 2003 he elaborated saying he added the tail because his editor told him without it Goku had no distinguishing features; while this was probably a joke, he went ahead and did it.<ref name=\"SonGokuDen\">{{cite book |title=Dragon Ball Z \u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a\u4f1d\u8aac|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|pages=90\u2013102|year=2003|isbn=4-08-873546-3}}</ref> Toriyama later stated that the tail was a pain to draw, hence why he had it get cut off early on,<ref>{{cite book |title=Dragon Ball \u30d5\u30eb\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc \u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30b6\u7de8 5|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|pages=240\u2013245|year=2013|isbn=978-4-08-870716-7}}</ref> and that he never thought of making Goku an alien until [[Vegeta]] appeared.<ref name=\"TenkaDen\">{{cite book |title=Dragon Ball \u5929\u4e0b\u4e00\u4f1d\u8aac|year=2004|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|pages=80\u201391|language=Japanese|isbn=4-08-873705-9}}</ref>\n\nMartial arts tournaments, as well as additional characters such as [[Krillin]] and {{nihongo4|Nam|\u30ca\u30e0|Namu}}, a [[yogi]]-inspired recurring tournament competitor, were eventually added to give the series a greater emphasis on fighting and [[martial arts]].<ref name=\"StoryGuide\"/> Knowing readers would expect Goku to win the tournaments, Toriyama had him lose the first two while continuing to plan an eventual victory.<ref name=\"StoryGuide\"/> When having fights in the manga, he had the characters go to a place where nobody lived to avoid difficulties in drawing destroyed buildings.<ref name=\"World\">{{cite book |title=Dragon Ball \u5927\u5168\u96c6 4 World Guide |year=1995 |publisher=[[Shueisha]]|pages=164\u2013169 |isbn=4-08-782754-2}}</ref> In order to advance the story quickly, he introduced Goku's signature flying nimbus cloud, then gave most fighters the ability to fly, and later granted Goku [[teleportation]].<ref name=\"World\"/>\n\nGoing against the normal convention that the strongest characters should be the largest in terms of physical size, he designed many of ''Dragon Ball''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s most powerful characters with small statures.<ref name=\"SJ interview\">{{cite journal |date=November 2007 |title=Interview with the Majin!

First introduced as a young boy, Goku was originally conceived by creator Akira Toriyama as a variation of [[Sun Wukong]], protagonist of the Chinese novel ''Journey to the West''; wherefore Goku also sported a prehensile tail until later. Upon meeting Bulma at the beginning of the series, the two then embark on an adventure to gather the seven Dragon Balls.{{gnr|ch|1}} After, Goku receives martial arts training from Master Roshi, meeting his lifelong friend Krillin and learning the famous ''Kamehameha'' technique, and enters the World Martial Arts Tournament to fight the strongest warriors on the planet. When the evil [[#Piccolo Daimao|King Piccolo]], and later his offspring [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]], tries to conquer the planet, Goku receives training from Earth's deities to defeat them.\n\nThough he appears human, it is later revealed that Goku is descended from an alien warrior race known as the Saiyans, who sent him, originally named Kakarot, to Earth to prepare it for conquest.{{gnr|ch|197}} Goku sacrifices his life to save the planet from his brother [[#Raditz|Raditz]],{{gnr|ch|205}} but must quickly get stronger in the afterlife under the tutelage of [[#Kai\u014d-sama|King Kai]], to save it from the other incoming Saiyans [[#Nappa|Nappa]] and [[Vegeta]]. He later becomes a Super Saiyan and defeats a powerful tyrant [[Frieza]]. This sets the tone of the rest of the series, with each enemy the characters face becoming stronger than the last, requiring them to attain further training. The last battle of the original manga, against [[Majin Buu]], has the entire universe at stake, and as such, has Goku and friends being asked for help from the gods of the universe, the [[#Kai\u014dshin|Supreme Kai]].\n\n===Bulma===\n{{main|Bulma}}\n{{nihongo4|Bulma|\u30d6\u30eb\u30de|Buruma}} first appears as a teenager, using the Dragon Radar, a fictional device she created to detect the energy signal emitted by Dragon Balls. She is led to Goku's location by the signal emitted by the four-star ball in his possession, and ends up recruiting him as a bodyguard while hoping to get his four-star ball to grant her wish for a boyfriend.{{gnr|ch|1}} She gives up on the wish after meeting [[Yamcha]],{{gnr|ch|23}} and much later in the series, she ends up forming a relationship with Vegeta. Bulma has also assumed the role of inventor, providing critical tech support to Goku and his friends with their battles against various enemies and threats. Some of her notable innovations include a microband that could make her shrink, and a [[Time travel|time machine]] that brought her son [[Trunks (Dragon Ball)|Trunks]] to the past.\n\n===Master Roshi===\n{{main|Master Roshi}}\n{{Nihongo4|Kame-Sen'nin|\u4e80\u4ed9\u4eba||\"Turtle Hermit\"}}, also known as {{Nihongo4|Muten-R\u014dshi|\u6b66\u5929\u8001\u5e2b||lit \"Invincible Old Master\"}} which is localised as \"Master Roshi\" in the English versions, is a perverted [[elderly martial arts master]] instructor that lives on a small island and is the inventor of the ''Kamehameha'' technique. Though he seems frail, he is a mighty warrior, having trained [[#Grandpa Gohan|Grandpa Gohan]] and Ox-King,{{gnr|ch|12}} Goku and [[Kuririn|Krillin]],{{gnr|ch|28}} and a few others. Despite his lechery and occasional whimsy or foolishness he is often depicted as wise, cantankerous, and perceptive. He is often accompanied by his talking sea turtle companion, referred to as {{nihongo4|Umigame|\u30a6\u30df\u30ac\u30e1||\"Sea Turtle\"}}, who often tries to point out his faulty ways. He is bald, sports a thick [[van dyke beard]], and wears sunglasses, beach clothes, or martial arts suits. He usually wields a walking stick and, in early appearances, wears a turtle's shell on his back. When wishing to appear anonymously in the World Martial Arts Tournament, Master Roshi uses the name {{Nihongo4|\"Jackie Chun\"|\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u30fb\u30c1\u30e5\u30f3|Jakk\u012b Chun}}, wears a wig and discards his sunglasses.{{gnr|ch|46}} Master Roshi was trained by Master Mutaito (\u6b66\u6cf0\u6597), who have also trained his [[Cohort (educational group)|cohortian]]-turned-rival {{Nihongo4|Tsuru-Sen'nin|\u9db4\u4ed9\u4eba||\"Crane Hermit\"}}; he has also received additional training from [[#Korin|Korin]]. {{gnr|ch|135|, |88}}\n\n===Yamcha===\n{{Main|Yamcha}}\n{{Nihongo4|Yamcha|\u30e4\u30e0\u30c1\u30e3|Yamucha}}, known as Zedaki in the [[Harmony Gold USA|Harmony Gold]] dub, is introduced as a desert [[bandit]] alongside his constant companion [[#Puar|Puar]], trying to steal [[Goku]] and [[Bulma]]'s Dragon Balls and wish not to feel nervous when near women.{{gnr|ch|8|, |9}} He eventually becomes Goku's ally and begins a relationship with Bulma, and later becomes a pupil of [[Master Roshi]].{{gnr|ch|23|, |112}} His signature attack is the {{nihongo4|''R\u014dgaf\u016bf\u016bken''|\u72fc\u7259\u98a8\u98a8\u62f3||\"Fist of the Wolf Fang\", rearranged as \"Wolf Fang Fist\" in the Funimation dub}}, a physical barrage of punches and palm strikes, ending with a double palm strike.{{gnr|ch|8}} As a result of training under Master Roshi, Yamcha is able to perform the ''Kamehameha'' and develops the {{nihongo4|''S\u014dkidan''|\u7e70\u6c17\u5f3e||\"Spinning Chi Bullet\"}}, an energy sphere directed by [[psychokinesis]].{{gnr|ch|117|, |175}} He also later trains under [[#Kami|Kami]] to prepare for the impending Saiyan invasion, but dies against one of their [[#Napp|Saibamen]].{{gnr|ch|209|, |215}} Before being wished back to life by the [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Shenlong|Namekian Dragon Balls]], he trained under [[#Kai\u014d|King Kai]] in the afterlife.{{gnr|ch|261|, |329}} He then helps out during the battles with the [[#Doctor Gero|Red Ribbon Androids]] and [[#Cell|Cell]], but for the most part does not participate in fighting.\n\n===Krillin===\n{{Main|Krillin}}\n{{nihongo4|Kuririn|\u30af\u30ea\u30ea\u30f3}}, Krillin in the English anime dub, is a bald martial artist and one of [[Goku]]'s best friends.

A purple catlike being seen wearing traditional [[Egyptian culture|Egyptian]] clothing and ornaments, he is a [[#God of Destruction|God of Destruction]] whose occupation is to maintain balance, who destroy planets, civilizations or external threats that put the development of the universe the deity oversees at risk. As a God of Destruction, he is capable of obliterating any target he desires, be it a living or undead being, an inert construct, or even an entire planet (or a specific portion at the deity's whim). His role is contrasted by the Supreme Kai who create and preserve them; together they rule over their respective universes and work with each other in order to maintain the balance of their respective universes. Because the Gods of Creation and Destruction share their life-force with each other, a Destroyer will die if their Supreme Kai counterpart perishes. \n\nContrary to what his title suggests, Beerus is not a villain, though he does find enjoyment in causing destruction. This is the main reason why Goku is unfazed by his actions. Goku understands that it is his job to destroy in order to maintain balance, and therefore respects him because of it. Often depicted as destroying planets (or half of one) in a whimsical manner, Beerus' two sole desires are enjoying the universe's finest cooking and fighting opponents who he considers to be worthy. The latter ultimately leads him to look for the Super Saiyan God who turns out to be one of the Saiyans now living on Earth. Eventually, [[Goku|Son Goku]] undertakes a ritual transformation into the Super Saiyan God and fights Beerus, just to be defeated by the God of Destruction. Having enjoyed the match, Beerus spares both Goku and the Earth, saying that Goku was the second strongest opponent he ever faced; first being his caretaker and martial arts teacher, [[#Whis|Whis]]. Beerus later forms a team consisting of Goku, [[Vegeta]], [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]], [[Majin Buu|Buu]], and Monaka (\u30e2\u30ca\u30ab) to participate in the [[List of Dragon Ball Super episodes#Season 3: Universe 6 Saga|Tournament of Destroyers]] after answering a challenge by his brother and fellow God of Destruction Champa.

A tall teal humanoid with pronounced effeminate features, he is an {{nihongo|Angel|\u5929\u4f7f|''Tenshi''}}, a being of extremely high status within the multiverse hierarchy. Each Angel is bound to the service of a God of Destruction of their respective universes, and rarely leaves them unaccompanied. Their role is to guide their deity to master their destructive capabilities, train their deity in martial arts and also to perform trivial duties such as preparing meals for their deity. They are tasked with supervising their deity and keeping them in check, and will intervene when they go too far. \n\nWhis is [[Beerus]]' martial arts teacher who always accompanies him wherever he goes. He is unmatched in power and possesses tremendous speed, effortlessly defending himself against Goku and Vegeta and when training the two for the fight against the resurrected Frieza. As an attendant to his universe's God of Destruction, Whis is responsible for monitoring Beerus and keeping him in line; for example, he would not permit him to engage his brother and long time rival Champa in any physical fight, as it is said that both of their respective universes will be destroyed should their fighting escalate.\n\nThe character's name stems from a misunderstanding. Toriyama incorrectly believed that Beerus' name was a pun on the word \"''beer''\" and so decided to follow the same rule to name the character's assistant. Thus, he ended up naming the character Whis, a pun on {{nihongo4|\"''whisky''\"|\u30a6\u30a4\u30b9\u30ad\u30fc|uisuk\u012b}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asahi.com/culture/update/0329/TKY201303290330.html |title=\u65b0\u4f5c\u6620\u753b\u300c\u539f\u4f5c\u8005\u306e\u610f\u5730\u300d\u3000\u9ce5\u5c71\u660e\u3055\u3093\u72ec\u5360\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc |language=Japanese |trans-title=New film by the \"stubborn manga writer\" Akira Toriyama; exclusive interview |work=[[Asahi Shimbun]] |date=March 30, 2013 |accessdate=July 22, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501075658/http://www.asahi.com/culture/update/0329/TKY201303290330.html |archivedate=May 1, 2013}}</ref> Whis is voiced by [[Masakazu Morita]] in Japanese media<ref name=\"Super\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-06-15/dragon-ball-super-main-visual-reveals-2-new-characters/.89281|title=Dragon Ball Super Main Visual Reveals 2 New Characters|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2015-06-15|accessdate=2015-06-15}}</ref> and [[Ian Sinclair (voice actor)|Ian Sinclair]] in the Funimation dub.\n\n==Antagonists==\n===Red Ribbon Army===\n[[File:Red Ribbon Army Logo.png|thumb|Red Ribbon Army logo]]\nThe {{Nihongo4|Red Ribbon Army|\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30ea\u30dc\u30f3\u8ecd|Reddo Ribon Gun}} is a paramilitary organization led by {{Nihongo4|Commander Red|\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u7dcf\u5e25|Reddo-S\u014dsui}}, a short man who has his forces raid towns in search for the Dragon Balls on a quest for world domination.

The organisation controlled a majority of Universe 7 at the peak of its power and serves as the primary antagonistic force of the first half of the ''Dragon Ball Z'' series. Frieza's father, {{nihongo4|King Cold|\u30b3\u30eb\u30c9\u5927\u738b|Korudo Dai\u014d}} was the leader of the organisation prior to passing control over to his son.\n\nThe organisation employs and enslaves powerful races, such as the Saiyans, to take over suitable planets so that they can be sold to the highest bidders, or alternatively to destroy planets which are determined to be not financially viable. Frieza's forces are equipped with scouters, portable computers mainly used to measure power levels, and wear standard-issue battle armor which usually have dual shoulder guards, matching gloves and Buuts, and some form of skirt armor or crotch guard.\n\nFrieza himself does not really consider his soldiers as an army, looking at them more as a convenient group of followers. In reality, the soldiers follow him and his relatives out of fear, though some soldiers are known to be fiercely loyal to Frieza such as the Ginyu Force.\n\n====Frieza====\n{{Main|Frieza}}\nThe self-styled emperor of Universe 7, Frieza first appears on Planet Namek, where he systematically eradicates most of the entire native [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Namekians|Namekian]] population in his quest to obtain the Dragon Balls so that he can wish for eternal life{{gnr|ch|249}}. It is eventually revealed that Frieza was responsible for destroying the Saiyan planet Vegeta, killing all but a few Saiyans, as he had feared their power.{{gnr|ch|257}} However, he retains three of them, [[Vegeta]], [[#Nappa|Nappa]] and [[#Raditz|Raditz]], as his underlings. Frieza later engages Goku and his associates in a protracted battle, with Goku transforming into a Super Saiyan after Frieza murders Krillin.{{gnr|ch|317}} Out of anger and frustration at his inability to counter Goku's newfound power, Frieza blasted a hole into Namek's core in order to destroy the planet.{{gnr|ch|320}} Frieza is then sliced in half by his own attack and begs for mercy, with Goku giving him some of his surplus energy.{{gnr|ch|326}} After he uses that energy to attack, Goku then seemingly kills Frieza.{{gnr|ch|327}} He is later rebuilt with cybernetic body parts and travels to Earth with his father King Cold and their forces to seek revenge, but all of them are eliminated with ease by Trunks who traveled back in time from the future.{{gnr|ch|331|, |332}} After the deaths of Frieza and Cold, the army soon fell into shambles and split into several factions.\n\nIn ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F']]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]'' series, one of Frieza's loyal officers named {{nihongo4|Sorbet|\u30bd\u30eb\u30d9|Sorube}} travels to Earth along with his subordinate {{nihongo4|Tagoma|\u30bf\u30b4\u30de}} to resurrect their master by using Earth's Dragon Balls to summon [[#Shenron|Shenron]].<ref name=\"ANN announcement\">{{cite web|title=1st Key Visual For 2015 Dragon Ball Z Film Reveals Frieza|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-11-17/1st-key-visual-for-2015-dragon-ball-z-film-reveals-frieza/.81112|website=[[Anime News Network]]|date=November 17, 2014|accessdate=November 17, 2014}}</ref> Frieza takes his time to recuperate and train, and is later accompanied by Sorbet and a thousand-strong military force for his journey back to Earth to once again exact revenge on Goku and his family and friends. Sorbet was killed by his own master's ''ki'' blast towards the end of the battle, which was intended for Krillin but was deflected by Vegeta. Even though Frieza utilizes a powerful new form developed as a result of intensive training, Goku defeats him once again and sends him back to Hell. A deceased Frieza is later recruited by Goku to participate in the Tournament of Power (\u529b\u306e\u5927\u4f1a ''Chikara no Taikai'', lit. \"Convention of Power\") as a member of Team Universe 7.\n\n====Raditz====\n{{Nihongo4|Raditz|\u30e9\u30c7\u30a3\u30c3\u30c4|Radittsu}} is a Saiyan warrior and the older brother of Goku.{{gnr|ch|197}} Raditz is one of the few remaining Saiyans following the destruction of their homeworld, planet Vegeta.{{gnr|ch|197}} He arrives on Earth, searching for his long-lost brother in order to recruit him in conquering other planets.{{gnr|ch|196}} When Goku refuses, Raditz kidnaps his nephew, Gohan, and orders Goku to kill 100 Earthlings within a day if he wants his son back.{{gnr|ch|197}} Instead, Goku and Piccolo team up to defeat Raditz, though not even their combined powers are enough.{{gnr|ch|198|, |200}} However, Goku makes the ultimate sacrifice by grappling with Raditz and allowing Piccolo to kill them both with his ''Makankosappo'' technique.{{gnr|ch|205}} Before Raditz dies, Piccolo taunts him by explaining that Goku will be revived by the Dragon Balls, though Raditz manages to send one final transmission to inform Vegeta and Nappa of this, believing that his Saiyan comrades will come to Earth and use the Dragon Balls to revive him.{{gnr|ch|204}} However, Vegeta and Nappa travel to Earth to use the Dragon Balls for their own purposes instead. In the anime, Raditz later makes a minor appearance in ''Dragon Ball GT'' along with many of the other villains who escaped Hell. He also makes a single panel appearance in Toriyama's 2014 ''[[Dragon Ball Minus: The Departure of the Fated Child]]'' special.<ref name=\"Fated\"/> He is voiced by [[Shigeru Chiba]] in Japanese,<ref name=\"Chiba\"/> [[Jason Gray-Stanford]] in the Ocean dub, and [[Justin Cook]] in the Funimation dub.\n\n====Nappa====\n{{nihongo4|Nappa|\u30ca\u30c3\u30d1}} is one of the few remaining Saiyans that were known to survive the destruction of their homeworld, Planet Vegeta.{{gnr|ch|197}} An elite Saiyan warrior, Nappa uses Saibamen (\u683d\u57f9\u30de\u30f3 ''Saibaiman'', lit. \"Cultivation Man\") as grunts to root out weaker opponents or to assess an opponent's power and skill level; known as Cultivars in the Viz translation of the manga, the Saibamen are green humanoid creatures that grow from a planted seed placed in the ground, which are stored in a special liquid prior to their use. Nappa encounters the Dragon Team after he traveled to Earth with the Saiyan prince Vegeta in search of the Dragon Balls. He survives Chiaotzu's self-destructing attack, causes Tien Shinhan to die of exhaustion and kills Piccolo.{{gnr|ch|217|, |218|, |223}} He eventually meets his match against Goku, who had returned to Earth after receiving intensive training from [[#Kai\u014d|King Kai]]. Upon discovering that Goku's new power level is [[It's Over 9000!|well over 8000]], Vegeta orders Nappa to stop fighting due to Goku's clear dominance over him, but he refuses and is incapacitated by Goku.{{gnr|ch|226}} Seeing that Nappa has been defeated, Vegeta mercilessly kills him himself.{{gnr|ch|227}} In ''Dragon Ball GT'', Nappa briefly returned as one of the escapees from Hell, only to be killed by Vegeta once more. In Japanese he is voiced by [[Sh\u014dz\u014d Iizuka]] in ''Dragon Ball Z'', [[Kiyoyuki Yanada]] in ''Dragon Ball GT'', and [[Tetsu Inada]] in ''Dragon Ball Kai''. In English he is voiced by [[Michael Dobson (actor)|Michael Dobson]] in the Ocean dub, and by [[Christopher Sabat]] and [[Phil Parsons (voice actor)|Phil Parsons]] in the Funimation dubs.\n\n====Zarbon and Dodoria====\n{{Nihongo4|Zarbon|\u30b6\u30fc\u30dc\u30f3|Z\u0101bon}} and Dodoria (\u30c9\u30c9\u30ea\u30a2) are two of [[Freeza|Frieza]]'s top ranking henchmen, first seen alongside their master on Planet Namek collecting the planet's Dragon Balls. Dodoria's demeanour is brutish and vulgar, while Zarbon appears to be a handsome, long-haired humanoid alien with a refined temperament. Bulma is blinded by her attraction to Zarbon's uncommon physical beauty during their initial encounter, and initially mistakes him for an ally. While their former cohort [[Vegeta]] have little difficulty dispatching Dodoria, who inadvertably revealed to Vegeta that Frieza was ultimately responsible for the destruction of the Saiyan homeworld, Zarbon manages to defeat and capture him after transforming into a powerful reptilian beast following their initial encounter.{{gnr|ch|263}} After Zarbon retrieves Vegeta's battered body and brings him to Frieza's ship in order to heal him for interrogation, Vegeta manages to escape and steal Frieza's Dragon Balls.{{gnr|ch|264|\u2013|266}} Zarbon sets out to find him once again, but Vegeta, having become stronger after experiencing the effects of a Saiyan genetic trait which increases his power level substantially following recovery from a near death experience, kills Zarbon in his beastly form.{{gnr|ch|268}}\n\nThe duo have been referenced in ''Dragon Ball Super'' and make cameo appearances in flashbacks. They also appear in ''[[Bardock - The Father of Goku]]'', where Zarbon advises Frieza to destroy the Saiyan homeworld, and Dodoria massacred Bardock's teammates. Both also make cameo appearances in ''Dragon Ball GT'' when they escape from Hell along with various other villains.

Though physically some of the strongest individuals in the universe, the Ginyu Force's members delight in coming up with strange poses, betting candy on fights, and playing [[Janken]]. Frieza calls upon them to assist in the defeat of Vegeta and help obtain the Dragon Balls on Planet Namek.{{gnr|ch|272}} In the anime, the four deceased members of the Ginyu Force (sans their leader, Captain Ginyu, who was still alive) appear at King Kai's planet in the afterlife and battle Tien Shinhan, Yamcha and Chiaotzu, who defeat and knock them down to Hell after a short skirmish. Tien Shinhan defeats Jeice and Burter, Yamcha defeats Recoome, and Chiaotzu defeats Guldo. King Kai reveals that he actually invited the Ginyu Force there in order to test their new strength subsequent to his training.\n\n{{Nihongo4|Gurd|\u30b0\u30eb\u30c9|Gurudo}}, named Guldo in the English anime dub, is a fat, short, four-eyed, green-skinned humanoid who, although physically weak, has psychic powers, including the ability to freeze time for as long as he can hold his breath.{{gnr|ch|273}} He can also immobilize opponents and control objects with [[Psychokinesis|telekinesis]].{{gnr|ch|274}} He is the first one killed when Vegeta interrupts his fight with Krillin and Gohan and [[Decapitation|decapitates]] him.{{gnr|ch|274}} Guldo is voiced by [[K\u014dz\u014d Shioya]] in the original series and [[Yasuhiro Takato]] in ''Kai''.

He is shown to be the most tactically skilled, as he deduced that Goku was masking his true power level by simply watching him fight. After seeing Goku's increased power level when using the ''Kaio-ken'', Ginyu inflicts a near fatal injury on himself.{{gnr|ch|285|, |286}} He then uses his unique technique that allows him to switch bodies with anyone, leaving Goku with Ginyu's nearly dead body.{{gnr|ch|286|, |287}} Ginyu (as Goku) momentarily deceives Krillin, but has trouble fighting Krillin and Gohan when he realizes that he can not fully control Goku's power.{{gnr|ch|288|, |289}} Ginyu then tries to switch into Vegeta's body, but Goku intervenes getting his body back, and when Ginyu tries again, he inadvertently switches bodies with a Namekian frog Goku throws in the way.{{gnr|ch|290}} In ''Dragon Ball Super'', Ginyu is revealed to have survived the destruction of Planet Namek and escaped to Earth, although he is still trapped in the body of a Namekian frog. He takes the opportunity to swap bodies with one of Frieza's soldiers named Tagoma, but is killed by Vegeta not long afterwards. In ''Dragon Ball GT'', he is briefly seen among several escapees from Hell as they return to there after they're defeated by Goku and the others. Ginyu is voiced by [[Hideyuki Hori]] in the original series and [[Katsuyuki Konishi]] in ''Kai''.

He is an [[Synthetic life|artificial life form]] created using the [[Cell (biology)|cells]] of several characters from the series, including Goku, Piccolo and Frieza. As a result, Cell is able to perform techniques such as the ''Kamehameha'', which he gains from the cells of Goku.{{gnr|ch|363}} Cell evolves several times throughout his appearances; he originally evolves from a [[cicada]]-like form into his Imperfect form, which is still [[insect]]-like in appearance. Both his first form and his second Semi-Perfect form have a long tail that ends in a stinger-like appendage and allows it to absorb other organisms.{{gnr|ch|361}} The tail recedes under his wings in his final Perfect form, and he can use it to spawn Cell Juniors, minuscule childlike versions of himself. Requiring the androids [[Android 17|17]] and [[Android 18|18]] to evolve, he finds out that they are already dead in his timeline, so he kills the Trunks of his timeline and uses Trunks' time machine to travel back in time. He eventually absorbs both after many battles and ascends to his perfect form.{{gnr|ch|372|, |380|, |381}} He decides to hold the {{nihongo4|Cell Games|\u30bb\u30eb\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0|Seru G\u0113mu}}, a tournament in which he fights against Earth's strongest fighters.{{gnr|ch|389}} Cell manages to defeat Goku, but he is eventually killed by Gohan.{{gnr|ch|416}}\n\n===Broly===\n{{Main|Broly}}\n{{nihongo4|Broly|\u30d6\u30ed\u30ea\u30fc|Buror\u012b}} is a character that appeared as the main villain in the films ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Broly - The Legendary Super Saiyan|Broly - The Legendary Super Saiyan]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Broly Second Coming|Broly Second Coming]]''. His backstory was that he was born with a power greater than most elite adult Saiyans, and is mentally unsettled as an adult due to the crying of the infant Goku in the incubator next to him when they were born, traumatic events during his childhood (including nearly being executed as well as Frieza's genocide) and also in part due to his extreme power. He eventually becomes the {{nihongo4|\"Legendary Super Saiyan\"|\u4f1d\u8aac\u306e\u8d85\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba|Densetsu no Ch\u014d Saiya-jin}} told of in legends, with his destructive tendencies only being quelled by a special controlling device created by scientists for his father, {{Nihongo4|Paragus|\u30d1\u30e9\u30ac\u30b9|Paragasu}}. In the eighth film, after Paragus lures Vegeta, Goku, and their companions to another planet, Broly recalls Goku and goes into a rage, destroying the control device and becoming the unstoppable Legendary Super Saiyan. He effortlessly pummels Super Saiyan Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, and Trunks as well as Piccolo, before killing his father. He is eventually defeated by Goku, but somehow manages to make his way into an escape pod. In the tenth film, he lands on Earth and goes into a frozen state until the crying of Goku's son Goten awakens him. He is killed by Goku, Gohan and Goten by their combined ''Kamehameha'' attack after being blasted through the sun. In ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Bio-Broly|Bio-Broly]]'', blood samples make their way into the hands of an industrialist, who creates a clone of the original Broly. The clone eventually wakes up and becomes mixed with bio-liquid, mutating him into a creature known as {{Nihongo4|\"Bio-Broly\"|\u30d0\u30a4\u30aa\u30d6\u30ed\u30ea\u30fc|Baio Buror\u012b}}. He fought Goten, Trunks, Android 18, and Krillin, and is eventually defeated by a combined ''Kamehameha'' attack after his body is exposed to sea water and becomes [[petrifaction|petrified]] as a result. He is voiced by [[Bin Shimada]] in the Japanese films, and [[Vic Mignogna]] in the Funimation dub.\n\nA reworked version of Broly that fits into the official Dragon Ball series continuity appears in the animated film ''[[Dragon Ball Super: Broly]]''. This Broly's backstory and physical appearance have been updated by [[Akira Toriyama]], who had only created concept art of the original character for the Z films that featured him.

Dabura is first seen when Goku, Gohan, Vegeta, Piccolo and Krillin are led to Babidi's ship by Supreme Kai and his attendant Kibito to aid them in preventing Majin Buu's awakening. Dabura proved to be a formidable foe for the group, and is compared to [[Cell (Dragon Ball)|Cell in his perfect form]] in terms of power level; he obliterates [[#Kai\u014dshin|Kibito]] single-handedly, turns Piccolo and Krillin to stone by spitting at them, and aids Babidi in corrupting Vegeta with a spell. Not long after his successful awakening by Babidi, Buu would turn on Dabura by transmuting him into a large cookie and consumed him. This in turn reverts his petrification of Piccolo and Krillin, restoring them to normal. In a filler episode of the ''Dragon Ball Z'' anime, an apparently redeemed Dabura was shown accompanying Bulma, Chi-Chi and Videl in their search for Gohan in the afterlife. Dabura was sent to Heaven by the ruler of the afterlife since, being a demon, he would enjoy Hell. Dabura is referenced in Dragon Ball Super and appears in flashback scenes. Dabura is voiced by Ry\u016bzabur\u014d \u014ctomo in the Japanese version of the anime series.

They possess green skin and antennae on their bald heads, and are able to make their own set of Dragon Balls. During the era of the Dragon Ball series, there were just over a hundred Namekians alive on their home planet, as most of their kind had died off a generation prior from a great calamity. While extraterrestrial in origin, the first Namekian characters encountered by Goku, King Piccolo and his mutated offspring, were known as the Demon Clan and thought of more earthly origin by the rest of the world.\n\nNamekians are hermaphrodites that possess physiques similar to those of human males and are seen reproducing asexually using a mode of reproduction similar to the [[parthenogenesis]], by spitting an egg out from their mouths. Despite this asexual reproductive system, there is still diversity in the species as each offspring is usually not an exact copy of their parent, like with [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Piccolo Daima\u014d|King Piccolo]], or the {{nihongo4|Great Elder|\u6700\u9577\u8001|Saich\u014dr\u014d}}  who is the progenitor of every remaining Namekian on the planet prior to the events of ''Dragon Ball''. The Great Elder, known as Guru in the English anime, pass on his position as leader of the Namekian people on to {{nihongo4|Muri|\u30e0\u30fc\u30ea|}} prior to his passing later in the series.{{gnr|ch|327}}\n\nDuring [[List of Dragon Ball Z chapters#Volume list|sixth volume of the ''Dragon Ball Z'' manga]] or  [[Namek Saga|Nama Saga arc of the anime]], Planet Namek is terrorized by [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Freeza|Frieza]] and [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Freeza's Army|his army]]. The Namekian homeworld is ultimately destroyed by Frieza as a last-ditch effort to kill Goku. All surviving Namekians are temporarily transported to Earth, where they reside for nearly a year before being resettled on another planet called New Namek. Later in the series, the young Namekian named Dende becomes the guardian deity of Planet Earth and its Dragon Balls.\n\nThe Namekians exist in both Universe 6 and Universe 7. [[#List_of_Dragon_Ball_characters#Champa|Champa]] claims the Namekians of Universe 6 originally found the Super Dragon Balls and broke off pieces to create their own set of Dragon Balls.\n\n====Kami====\n{{Nihongo4|Kami|\u795e||lit. \"God\"}} is the creator of the Earth's Dragon Balls, and served as its guardian deity until the second half of the ''Dragon Ball Z'' series. The word \"kami\" is a generic term used by various characters throughout the series when referring to gods and deities in the original Japanese dialogue; this character is simply referred to as ''Kami'' (\u795e\u69d8), and his actual name is never revealed. He and [[#Piccolo Daima\u014d|King Piccolo]] were once one being, later revealed to be a Namekian, who expelled the evil inside him order to assume the mantle of Earth's guardian deity.{{gnr|ch|164}} The evil incarnation, King Piccolo, then went on to terrorize Earth until being sealed away by [[Master Roshi|Master Roshi's]] master, Mutaito. Because they are one, if either Kami or King Piccolo dies, then the other will as well and the Dragon Balls cease to exist.{{gnr|ch|165|, |207}} Shortly before King Piccolo dies at the hands of Goku, he spawns a much stronger incarnation, [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]], who takes over these same traits and retains his memories. Kami later attempts to attempt to seal away the new Piccolo himself using the same technique as Mutaito, and enters the 23rd World Martial Arts Tournament, possessing a human named {{Nihongo4|Shen|\u30b7\u30a7\u30f3||\"Hero\" in the English anime dub}} as a guise.{{gnr|ch|175|, |181}} But Piccolo has learned to reverse the technique and traps Kami in a water jug instead and swallows it, later being released thanks to Goku.{{gnr|ch|181|, |182|, |187}} During the fight against the Saiyans, Kami dies when Piccolo is killed by Nappa, but through the power of the Namekian Dragon Balls they both are wished back to life.{{gnr|ch|223|, |293}} During the Android Saga, Kami agrees to fuse with Piccolo, with Piccolo absorbing his energy, strength, memories, intelligence and thought pattern.{{gnr|ch|356|, |360}} A young Namekian named [[#Dende|Dende]] later succeeds him as the new Kami. He is voiced by [[Takeshi Aono]] in Japanese,<ref name=\"Aono\"/> who would do so up until the Frieza arc in ''Dragon Ball Kai''. After Aono suffered a stroke, [[Bin Shimada]] voiced the character for his final appearance during the Cell saga. In English he is voiced by [[Michael Dobson (actor)|Michael Dobson]] and [[Dale Wilson (actor)|Dale Wilson]] in the Ocean dub, and [[Christopher Sabat]] in the Funimation dub.\n\n====Dende====\n{{Nihongo4|Dende|\u30c7\u30f3\u30c7}} is a child of the Great Elder of Planet Namek. He was saved from [[Freeza|Frieza]]'s henchman Dodoria (\u30c9\u30c9\u30ea\u30a2) by Gohan and Krillin as a youth and taken into their care.{{gnr|ch|255}} Dende then guides Krillin to the Great Elder to tap into vast-hidden reserves of his power.{{gnr|ch|265}} He also interprets the Earthlings' wishes when utilizing the Namekian Dragon Balls, as the wish must be said in the native language of the Namekians.{{gnr|ch|292|, |293|, |324}} Dende later gains the power to heal injuries after having his own power unlocked by the Great Elder, which he uses to aid the warriors fighting Frieza until he is killed by the tyrant for being disruptive and helping the Earthlings.{{gnr|ch|299|, |304}} After being resurrected,{{gnr|ch|323}} Dende resides on New Namek until he is asked by Goku to become Earth's guardian deity.{{gnr|ch|393|, |394}} He accepts the position, revives Earth's inert Dragon Balls, and continues to serve as Earth's guardian deity throughout the rest of the series. Dende develops a close working relationship with [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]], as the latter had fused with fellow Namekians {{nihongo4|Nail|\u30cd\u30a4\u30eb|Neiru}}, whom Dende was friends with, and his [[#Kami|predecessor]].

After Buu is defeated, the two form a relationship, eventually having a daughter named Pan.{{gnr|ch|518}} When the two fight crime together afterwards, she takes on the role of the \"Great Saiyaman 2\" or \"Great Saiyawoman\".

As a toddler and later young child, she resembles her father: she has his eye shape and apparent lack of a nose. However, she does indeed have a nose, though small, and as she grows older, Marron begins to resemble her mother. Unlike her parents, Marron is not a martial artist and does not appear to possess any fighting ability or special powers. In Japanese media she was initially voiced by [[Tomiko Suzuki]], by [[Naoko Watanabe (voice actress)|Naoko Watanabe]] in the TV special ''[[Yo! Son Goku and His Friends Return!!]]'' and the ''Battle of Gods'' film, and by Hiroko Ushida in [[Dragon Ball Z Kai]] and [[Dragon Ball Super]].

After befriending Mr. Satan who convinced him of the error of his murderous ways, the Dai Supreme Kai's influence within Buu moved the creature to reform, leading him to expel his evil tendencies which become a different lifeform altogether. This aspect of Buu is identical in appearance to his chubby progenitor, although any malevolent behaviour previously displayed are gone; he is now a chidlike entity of good who is kind, caring, and is less likely to throw tantrums of anger. He is also much weaker in power, and lacks some of the original Majin Buu's unique capabilities. For example, he no longer needs to hibernate for incredibly long periods of time - instead entering an unwaking sleep for a brief period of time. Mr. Buu moves in with his best friend Mr. Satan after the original Majin Buu's demise, and continues to appear as a supporting character in subsequent ''Dragon Ball'' media.\n\n===Pan===\n{{Nihongo4|Pan|\u30d1\u30f3}} is the granddaughter of Goku and daughter of Gohan and Videl,{{gnr|ch|518}} as such her ancestry comes from both humans and the extraterrestrials called the Saiyans.

In ''Dragon Ball Super'', she easily defeats Vegeta when being controlled by her creators archenemy [[Dr. Mashirito]] and has a seemingly even match against Goku.\n\n===Bardock===\n{{Nihongo4|Bardock|\u30d0\u30fc\u30c0\u30c3\u30af|B\u0101dakku}}, Burdock in Viz's English manga translation, is the husband of {{nihongo4|Gine|\u30ae\u30cd}}, and the father of Raditz and Kakarrot (Goku). Bardock's story is shown in the [[Dragon Ball Z: Bardock - The Father of Goku|1990 ''Dragon Ball Z'' TV special]] and in Toriyama's 2014 ''[[Dragon Ball Minus: The Departure of the Fated Child]]'' special. In the TV special, during a routine planet conquering mission on the planet Kanassa, one of the surviving inhabitants strikes Bardock, giving him its native ability to see into the future in the process. Soon, Bardock began to see visions of Frieza's plan to destroy Planet Vegeta and all of the Saiyans, as well as Goku's future on Earth. Bardock attempts to prevent the destruction of his race by challenging Frieza in orbit of planet Vegeta, but is unsuccessful, and becomes the first of the Saiyans to be obliterated by Frieza. Before his death, however, Bardock has one final vision of Goku challenging Frieza, and is able to die pleased knowing his son would avenge their race. \n\nIn ''Dragon Ball Minus'', which takes place a month before the destruction of Planet Vegeta, Bardock has a strong feeling that Frieza is up to something when they receive an order for all Saiyans to return home, so he convinces Gine to send their infant son, Kakarrot, in a space pod to Earth, a planet far enough away to escape Frieza's interest, with a native population weak enough to pose no threat to Kakarot<ref name=\"Fated\">{{cite book |last=Toriyama |first=Akira |date=2015-01-06 |title=[[Jaco the Galactic Patrolman]] |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |pages=232\u2013247 |isbn= 978-1-4215-6630-6}}</ref>.

In English she is voiced by Ellen Kennedy in the Ocean dub, and by [[Linda Chambers-Young]] in the Funimation dub.\n\n===Fusion characters {{anchor|Fusion Characters}}===\nA recurring theme in the ''Dragon Ball series'' are characters created through the process of merging (\u5408\u4f53 ''gattai'', lit. \"union\") two or more separate beings into one. The idea to have two characters \"fuse\" together was suggested by Akira Toriyama's long-time friend and fellow manga artist [[Masakazu Katsura]], leading to the introduction of [[composite character|amalgamations of characters]] formed through various techniques. In the anime, the resulting fused characters tend to be depicted as speaking with a dual voice consisting of both fusees' voices.\n\nThe Fusion (\u30d5\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3 Fy\u016bjon) technique, first introduced when the threat of Majin Buu emerged, is a ritual dance developed by an alien species called the Metamorans which Goku learned in the Other World. The purpose of this technique is to temporarily merge two or more bodies into a single, superior entity with characteristics from both fusees. The newly fused body is dressed in Metamoran attire; a dark colored vest lined with light colored linen, white pants with a cloth belt and Buuts. When the ritual dance is performed properly, the single being created possesses an astounding level of power, far beyond what either fusee would have had individually by combining each other's attributes from strength and speed to reflexes, intelligence and wisdom. The resulting fusion only lasts up to 30 minutes, after which the fusees revert to their normal selves. Examples of characters created with this technique include {{nihongo4|Gotenks|\u30b4\u30c6\u30f3\u30af\u30b9|Gotenkusu}}, the fusion of Goten and Trunks; and {{nihongo4|Gogeta|\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf|Goj\u012bta}}, the fusion of Goku and Vegeta.\n\nTwo individuals wearing a single matching Potara (\u30dd\u30bf\u30e9) earring but on opposite ears may trigger a {{nihongo4|Potara Fusion|\u30dd\u30bf\u30e9\u306e\u5408\u4f53|Potara no Gattai}}.<ref name=\"Movies\"/><ref>{{cite web| last1 = Kido| first1 = Misaki C.| last2 = Bae|first2 = John| title = Exclusive: Masakazu Katsura Spotlight|publisher=[[Viz Media]]| url = http://shonenjump.viz.com/node/178| accessdate = 2015-03-10| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140712150818/http://shonenjump.viz.com/node/178| archivedate = 2014-07-12}}</ref> These earrings, usually worn by the Supreme Kai and their aides, combine both users into a new body with complete attributes in the final product, as well as an increase in power and personality which is greater than the sum of the two individuals. Mortals have a one-hour time limit before the fusees de-fuse, but if a deity is one of the fusees, then the fusion will become permanent. However, there are alternate methods of dissolving the fusion regardless of whoever the participants are, usually by forcing the fusees apart (such as being magically split through a wish granted by Shenron). Examples of characters created by wearing a matching pair of Potara earrings include Kibito Kai, a fusion of [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Kai\u014dshin|Kibito and the East Supreme Kai of Universe 7]]; Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8 ''Bejitto''), a fusion of Goku and Vegeta also known as Vegerot in the Viz English manga; Kefla (\u30b1\u30d5\u30e9 ''Kefura''), a fusion of [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Kale|Kale]] and [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Caulifla|Caulifla]]; and Fused [[Zamasu]] (\u5408\u4f53\u30b6\u30de\u30b9 ''Gattai Zamasu''), known as Fusion Zamasu in the anime and God Zamas in the Viz manga, born of the union between Goku Black and Zamasu from an alternate future timeline. The deity known as the {{nihongo4|Old Kai\u014dshin|\u8001\u754c\u738b\u795e|R\u014d Kai\u014dshin}} is in fact a fusion of the original East Supreme Supreme Kai from 15 generations prior (\uff11\uff15\u4ee3\u524d\u306e\u6771\u306e\u754c\u738b\u795e ''J\u016bgo-Dai mae no Higashi no Supreme Kai'', lit. \"A God of a Boundary King of the East of 15 Generations Before\") and an old witch who stole one of his Potara earrings and put it on without being aware of the consequences.\n\nThe [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Namekians|Namekians]] demonstrate a related technique early in the ''Dragon Ball Z'' series, where one Namekian absorbs the energy, strength, memories, and intelligence or thought patterns of another through a process akin to {{Nihongo4|assimilation|\u878d\u5408|Y\u016bg\u014d}}. Each participant must willingly consent to fuse in this manner and usually the pair agrees to the stronger of the two to serve their body as the host. The agreed host places his hand over the chest of the other one and through unknown means, they merge with a blinding flash. Only the body of the host remains in the aftermath, and the non-host is assimilated and ceases to exist as a body. The current incarnation of Piccolo is a notable example, having assimilated two other Namekian individuals into his very being. Villainous characters like [[#Cell|Cell]] and [[#Majin Boo|Majin Buu]] are also capable of forcibly absorbing other characters in order to acquire greater power by taking advantage of their unique physiology.\n\n===Grandpa Gohan===\n{{Nihongo4|Grandpa Son Gohan|\u5b6b\u609f\u98ef\u3058\u3044\u3055\u3093|Son Gohan J\u012bsan}} is the adoptive grandfather of Goku, whom he found in a crashed spaceship.{{gnr|ch|197}} He teaches Goku martial arts, having originally studied under Master Roshi with Ox-King and also knows the ''Kamehameha'' technique.{{gnr|ch|12|, |106}} He warns Goku not to look at the full moon, but Goku disobeys him and  accidentally kills him while on a rampage in his giant ape form.{{gnr|ch|21|, |233}} Goku does not learn this until Vegeta turns into an ape and tells Goku about the transformations.{{gnr|ch|233}} He is brought back to life for one day by Baba Uranai in order to fight Goku and see his growth as a martial artist.{{gnr|ch|108}} In the anime only, he later appears as an assistant to {{nihongo4|Annin|\u30a2\u30f3\u30cb\u30f3}}, the ruler of the \"magical furnace\". He is voiced by [[Osamu Saka]] in the Japanese version of the original series, by [[Kinpei Azusa]] in ''Bardock: The Father of Goku'' and by [[Shigeru Chiba]] in ''Dragon Ball Kai''. In the Funimation dub of the series, he is voiced by [[Christopher Sabat]]. He is portrayed by [[Randall Duk Kim]] in the American live-action film ''[[Dragonball Evolution]]''; his voice was dubbed by [[Hiroya Ishimaru]] in the Japanese version. Grandpa Son Gohan briefly appears in the final chapter of Toriyama's 2013 manga series ''Jaco the Galactic Patrolman'', which is set before ''Dragon Ball''.<ref name=\"Jaco\"/>\n\n===Kai===\nThe {{anchor|Kai}}{{Nihongo4|Kai\u014d|\u754c\u738b}}, referred to as Lords of Worlds in Viz's English manga and the Kai in the English anime dub, are upper-level gods of the ''Dragon Ball'' multiverse.{{gnr|ch|205}} There are five at a time; one presiding over each of the four quadrants of the universe and the last, the {{nihongo4|Dai Kai\u014d|\u5927\u754c\u738b||\"Great Lord of Worlds\"}}, overseeing them all.{{gnr|ch|440}} The Kai reside in the heavens and are responsible for the lower-level deities who rule over individual planets. Later in the series it is revealed that Supreme Kai exist; they are themselves in charge of the Kai.{{gnr|ch|440}}, and that all Kai and Supreme Kai hail from the same race of beings. It is possible for an individual Kai to be promoted to the rank of the Supreme Kai after a period of training as an apprentice. For example, Zamasu was the former {{Nihongo4|North Kai\u014d|\u5317\u306e\u754c\u738b|Kita no Kai\u014d}} of Universe 10 prior to being chosen by the ruling Supreme Kai of Universe 10 as his apprentice and eventual successor.\n\nThe North Kai of Universe 7, named King Kai in the English anime dub and as the Lord of the Northern Worlds in the Viz Media localization, trains Goku after his self-sacrifice to defeat Raditz, and eventually trains Yamcha, Tien Shinhan, Chiaotzu and Piccolo. He is the only other Kai to appear in the original manga, besides a brief appearance of the {{Nihongo4|South Kai\u014d|\u5357\u306e\u754c\u738b|Minami no Kai\u014d}},{{gnr|ch|428}} and as such is usually simply referred to as {{Nihongo4|Kai\u014d-sama|\u754c\u738b\u69d8}} or Northern King Kai. King Kai trains dead fighters that were allowed to keep their bodies, if they manage to reach his small planet at the end of {{Nihongo4|Serpent Road|\u86c7\u306e\u9053|Hebi no Michi|\"Snake Way\" in the English anime dub}}.{{gnr|ch|205}} Before training any students, he forces them to appeal to his strange sense of humor and catch his pet monkey {{Nihongo4|Bubbles|\u30d0\u30d6\u30eb\u30b9}}.{{gnr|ch|210|, |211}} In the anime, they must also hit the flying cricket {{Nihongo4|Gregory|\u30b0\u30ec\u30b4\u30ea\u30fc}} with a mallet. King Kai provides Goku with martial arts training and two of his own techniques, the {{Nihongo4|''Genki-Dama''|\u5143\u6c17\u7389}} and the {{Nihongo4|''Kai\u014d-ken''|\u754c\u738b\u62f3}}, which he himself was never able to master.{{gnr|ch|212|, |227}} He continues to help Goku and his friends throughout the series, lending his planet locating and telecommunicating abilities for their use. When Goku brings a self-destructing Cell to his planet, the explosion kills King Kai and Bubbles and destroys his planet.{{gnr|ch|412|, |413}} As he is already in the afterlife, he only gains a halo, and in the anime appears to settle down on the Dai Kai's planet. He is voiced by [[J\u014dji Yanami]] in Japanese media until episode twelve of ''Dragon Ball Super'', where [[Naoki Tatsuta]] took over the role,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-09-25/naoki-tatsuta-temporarily-replaces-jouji-yanami-as-kaio-narrator-in-dragon-ball-super-anime/.93369|title=Naoki Tatsuta Temporarily Replaces Jouji Yanami as Kai\u014d/Narrator in Dragon Ball Super Anime|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2015-09-25|accessdate=2015-09-25}}</ref> [[Don Brown (voice actor)|Don Brown]] and [[Dave Ward (voice actor)|Dave Ward]] in the Ocean dub, [[Sean Schemmel]] in the Funimation dub, and [[Michael McConnohie]] in the Bang Zoom!

After the Saiyans were annexed by Frieza as a vassal state, he had no choice but to pledge allegiance to him, while at the same time retaining power over his own people as a vassal. King Vegeta is killed by Frieza when he leads a rebellion against him and boards his spaceship to retrieve his son. After his death, Frieza destroys his home planet and commits genocide of the entire Saiyan race. In ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods]]'' and in both the anime and manga versions of ''Dragon Ball Super'', King Vegeta is seen in flashbacks depicting his encounter with [[Beerus]] during the latter's visit to Planet Vegeta. In Japanese, he is voiced by [[Banj\u014d Ginga]] in episode 78 of ''Dragon Ball Z'', [[Yukimasa Kishino]] in episode 124 and [[Masaharu Sat\u014d]] in the eighth ''Dragon Ball Z'' film. [[Terry Klassen]] voices him in the Ocean dub, while [[Christopher Sabat]] voices him in the Funimation dub.\n\n===Monaka===\nMonaka (\u30e2\u30ca\u30ab) is a short and slender, humanoid red alien from planet Wagashi. He is deliveryman whom the God of Destruction Beerus recruits for the Tournament of Destroyers and is used as motivation for Goku to get stronger. At the conclusion of the storyline, he inadvertently won the tournament on behalf of Universe 7 after Universe 6's [[#Hit|Hit]] threw their fight. \n\nHe is voiced by [[Masami Kikuchi]] in the Japanese version of the series. In the Funimation English Dub, his voice is supplied by Daman Mills.\n\n===Pilaf Gang===\n{{Nihongo4|Pilaf|\u30d4\u30e9\u30d5|Pirafu}}, {{anchor|Pilaf}}Emperor Pilaf in the English anime dub, is a small impish blue creature who is the leader of the Pilaf Gang (\u30d4\u30e9\u30d5\u4e00\u5473 ''Pirafu Ichimi'') and dreams of ruling the world. Together with his two minions, [[#Mai|Mai]] and {{anchor|Shu}}{{Nihongo4|Shu|\u30b7\u30e5\u30a6|Sh\u016b}}, a humanoid dog in a ninja outfit, he seeks out the Dragon Balls to wish for world domination.

They later attempted to infiltrate Bulma's birthday party in order to claim the Dragon Balls again, with Pilaf being mistaken for a monkey while Trunks proclaim Mai to be his girlfriend. During the course of the ''Dragon Ball Super'' series the Pilaf Gang would gradually reform, much like several of Goku's past adversaries, and they even become Trunks' classmates at school.\n\nThe Pilaf Gang appear in the first episode of ''Dragon Ball GT'', where they obtain the Black Star Dragon Balls and Pilaf accidentally wish Goku to be a child again, setting in motion the events of the entire series.

She is initially depicted as a beautiful, calculating enemy of Goku and his friends who always resorts to weaponry and technology; her serious tone is a foil to the comic personalities of her colleagues. At some point in time prior to the [[#Cell|Cell Games]], Mai and her colleagues had used the Dragon Balls to wish for their youth, resulting in them being turned into children.\n\nDuring the Trunks Saga arc of ''Dragon Ball Super'', a once again adult Mai is revealed to be leader of the resistance forces on Earth  against the evil Goku Black in an alternate future timeline. This alternate future version of Mai (\u672a\u6765\u306e\u30de\u30a4 ''Mirai no Mai'') is depicted as a close friend and potential love interest of her timeline's Trunks, and works closely with him and their allies from the main timeline in an effort to defeat Goku Black and foil his so-called Zero Mortal Plan, which involve the complete annihilation of all mortal life in the multiverse. This version of Mai also appears as a major supporting character in [[Super Dragon Ball Heroes]], an original net animation based on the arcade game of the same name.

After the wish is granted the balls scatter across the planet, turn to stone and are useless for a year, meaning, during this year they can not be detected by Bulma's Dragon Radar.{{gnr|ch|1|, |20}} The Dragon Balls also become useless if Shenron is destroyed, in this case they must be recreated by their creator, or if their creator is killed.{{gnr|ch|148|, |165|, |194}} Shenron can not bestow a wish that exceeds the power of his creator, this is why Shenron couldn't destroy the Saiyans before they came to earth.{{gnr|ch|243}} Midway through the series, it is learned that the Dragon Balls are created by the extraterrestrials named Namekians, Earth's Kami being one of them.{{gnr|ch|242}} A person can only be brought back to life once, and only if that person did not die of natural causes.{{gnr|ch|218|, |321}} Earth is without Dragon Balls for a period, when Kami re-merges with Piccolo, until Dende takes over the position of God.{{gnr|ch|355|, |360|, |393}} When Dende recreates Earth's Dragon Balls, he makes them so that one can now have two wishes, but each wish is still capable of resurrecting multiple individuals at once.{{gnr|ch|394}} Shenron is voiced by [[Kenji Utsumi]] in the Japanese version of the series until his death in 2013 with the exclusion of episodes 192 and 193 in the series and the films, in which he is voiced by [[Masaharu Sat\u014d]]; he is voiced by [[Daisuke G\u014dri]] in ''Dragon Ball GT'', by [[K\u014dji Yada]] in the ''[[Dr. Slump]]'' remake and by [[Ry\u016bzabur\u014d \u014ctomo]] since episode 97 of ''Kai''. In the English versions of the series, he is voiced by [[Don Brown (voice actor)|Don Brown]] in the Ocean dub, and by [[Christopher Sabat]] in the Funimation dub.\n\nShenron's Namekian counterpart is {{Nihongo4|Porunga|\u30dd\u30eb\u30f3\u30ac||Namekian for \"God of Dreams\"}}.{{gnr|ch|292}} Porunga has a large, muscular humanoid upper body and something similar to a [[dorsal fin]] down his back and the Dragon Balls are much larger than Earth's. Unlike Shenron, he can only bring a single person back to life at a time, but he can bring that person back multiple times which Shenron can not.{{gnr|ch|292|, |327}} He can also grant three wishes instead of one, additionally the user must speak in the Namekian language.{{gnr|ch|292}} Porunga and the Namekian Dragon Balls were created by the planet's Great Elder, who kept one ball and gave each of the other six to a different elder.{{gnr|ch|252|, |260}} When the Namekian Dragon Balls are used again during the fight with Majin Buu, Porunga had been upgraded to be able to wish back multiple people at once and still grant three wishes.{{gnr|ch|513}} Porunga is voiced by [[Junpei Takiguchi]] in the Japanese version of the series with the exclusion of episode 283, in which he is voiced by Daisuke G\u014dri; he is voiced by Masaharu Sat\u014d in the video games. In ''Dragon Ball Kai'' Daisuke G\u014dri originally performed the role; after his death, Ry\u016bzabur\u014d \u014ctomo took over. He is voiced by Christopher Sabat in the Funimation dub of the series.\n\n''Dragon Ball GT'' introduces {{nihongo4|Ultimate Shenlong|\u7a76\u6975\u795e\u9f8d|Ky\u016bkyoku Shenron}}, a much larger red Shenron made by Kami when he and King Piccolo were still one entity. He is summoned when the Dark Dragon Balls, Black Star Dragon Balls in the Funimation dub, are gathered, and can grant any single wish, regardless of any restrictions placed on the other dragons. Ultimate Shenron is voiced by Kenji Utsumi in Japanese, and by Christopher Sabat in the Funimation dub. ''GT'' also introduces {{nihongo4|Black Smoke Shenlong|\u9ed2\u7159\u306e\u9f8d|Kokuen no Ry\u016b|lit. \"Black Smoke Dragon\"}}, named Black Smoke Shenron in the Funimation dub, a cigar-smoking dragon who forms from all the negative energy accumulated from the selfish wishes granted throughout the series using the Dragon Balls. Summoned from the same Earth Dragon Balls, he splits into the seven Evil Dragons and they spread out over the Earth, causing the heroes to defeat each one. [[Daisuke G\u014dri]] voices Evil Shenron in Japanese, and Christopher Sabat voices him in the Funimation dub.\n\n''Dragon Ball Super'' introduces {{nihongo|Super Shenlong|\u8d85\u795e\u9f8d|S\u016bp\u0101 Shenron}} and the Super Dragon Balls which are spread throughout Universes 6 and 7. The Super Dragon Balls were created by the Dragon God {{nihongo|Zalama|\u30b6\u30e9\u30de|Zarama}}, are the size of planets and have no restrictions on their wishes, although they only grant one and it must be spoken in the language of the gods. It is revealed that the Namekians took fragments of the Super Dragon Balls to create their own on Planet Namek. Super Shenron is voiced by Ry\u016bzabur\u014d \u014ctomo in Japanese and by Christopher Sabat in English.\n\n===Supreme Kai {{anchor|Kaioshin}}===\nThe {{Nihongo4|Kai\u014dshin|\u754c\u738b\u795e}}, referred to as Lords of Lords in Viz's English manga and the Supreme Kai in the English anime dub, are the highest-level deities in the ''Dragon Ball'' universe. Like the Kai whom they govern, all Supreme Kai hail from a race of naturally divine beings<ref name=\"SEG\">''[[Dragon Ball: Super Exciting Guide]]s'', 2009</ref> While the Kai watch over the living world, the Supreme Kai watch over both the \"Other World\" (the afterlife in the ''Dragon Ball'' series) and the living world.<ref>'Daizenshuu 7'', 1996</ref> The Supreme Kai are known for recruiting mortal beings to become their {{Nihongo4|disciples|\u754c\u738b\u795e\u306e\u5f1f\u5b50|Kaioshin no deshi}}; [[Gohan]] and [[Trunks (Dragon Ball)#Future Trunks|Trunks]] trained under their universe's Supreme Kai to prepare for threats like [[#Majin Boo|Majin Buu]] and [[#Dabra|Dabura]], and gained access to healing powers in the process. The Supreme Kai and their followers wear a pair of earrings known as the Potara (\u30dd\u30bf\u30e9), which allow two individuals to fuse into an amalgamation and permits the wearer to use a Time Ring. In ''Dragon Ball Super'', it is revealed that Gods of Destruction exist and are equal in status to the Supreme Kai. Supreme Kai act as {{nihongo|\"creation gods\"|\u5275\u9020\u795e|s\u014dz\u014dshin}}, by providing the energy for the creation of new planets and species, while the Gods of Destruction serve a contrasting purpose by destroying planets or entire civilizations when appropriate to maintain the balance of the universe they oversee.\n\n====Universe 7====\nThere were originally five Supreme Kai in the Seventh Universe, and much like the Kai, four of them ruled over each of the four quadrants of the universe and a fifth, the {{Nihongo4|Dai Kai\u014dshin|\u5927\u754c\u738b\u795e|\"Great Lord of Lords\"}}, ruled over them in turn.{{gnr|ch|445}} Prior to the events depicted in ''Dragon Ball'', all but one met their fate at the hands of [[Majin Boo|Majin Buu]]. The Dai Supreme Kai in particular was absorbed by Buu, who then takes a chubby form with an uncanny resemblance to the deity. The Dai Supreme Kai's spirit would continue to manifest within Buu, his benign influence dulling the creature's destructive nature to an extent. {{gnr|ch|445}}\n\nThe {{nihongo4|East Kai\u014dshin|\u6771\u306e\u754c\u738b\u795e|Higashi no Kai\u014dshin}}, originally the ruler of the eastern quadrant of Universe 7, became the de facto ruler of the entire universe as a result of the demise of his peers.{{gnr|ch|445|, |440}} He has purple skin and a white mohawk and is always accompanied by his larger, reddish-pink skinned, loyal attendant {{nihongo4|Kibito|\u30ad\u30d3\u30c8}}. In the ''Dragon Ball'' manga he came to Earth, under the alias {{nihongo4|\"Shin\"|\u30b7\u30f3}}, to meet Goku and his friends and recruit them to stop Babidi from reviving Buu.{{gnr|ch|438|, |446|, |460}} After failing to prevent to Buu's return, Gohan is then taken to the Supreme Kai's faraway planet (\u754c\u738b\u795e\u754c Supreme Kaikai, lit. \"Realm of the Lord of Lords\") where he is given the {{nihongo4|Zeta Sword|\u30bc\u30c3\u30c8\u30bd\u30fc\u30c9|Zetto S\u014ddo}} (\"Z Sword\" in the English anime dub) and put to training. The sword is accidentally broken during Gohan's training, releasing an ancestor of the East Supreme Kai. He uses his power to increase Gohan's and his own life force to resurrect Goku, who made the decision to remain in the afterlife after his death by a self-destructing [[Cell (Dragon Ball)|Cell]]. The elder Supreme Kai, referred to as the {{nihongo4|Old Kai\u014dshin|\u8001\u754c\u738b\u795e|R\u014d Kai\u014dshin}}, remains by his descendant's side as an advisor following Majin Buu's defeat, and makes recurring appearances in subsequent ''Dragon Ball'' media.{{gnr|ch|471|, |479}}\n\nKibito and the East Supreme Kai later gets permanently fused into one being, known as {{nihongo4|Kibitoshin|\u30ad\u30d3\u30c8\u795e}} in the manga and as Kibito Kai in the anime, via their use of Potara earrings.{{gnr|ch|501}} Kibito Kai later assists in the final battle with Buu by teleporting Goku and the last survivors on Earth onto his planet and helps take Dende to New Namek to use its Dragon Balls to revive Earth and its people.{{gnr|ch|508|, |513}} In ''Dragon Ball Super'', Kibito Kai uses a wish granted by the Namekian Dragon Balls to defuse himself back into the two original component entities.\n\nThe East Supreme Kai is voiced by [[Y\u016bji Mitsuya]],<ref name=\"new voices\"/> and by Shinichir\u014d \u014cta in ''Dragon Ball Super'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods|Battle of Gods]]''. In English the Supreme Kai is voiced by [[Kent Williams (voice actor)|Kent Williams]] in Funimation's English dub, and by Michael Dobson in the Ocean Group dub.\n\nKibito is voiced by Shin Aomori, by Don Brown in the Ocean Group dub and by Chuck Huber in the Funimation dub.\n\nThe Elder Kai is voiced by Reiz\u014d Nomoto in ''Dragon Ball Z'' and ''Dragon Ball GT'', and by Ry\u014dichi Tanaka in ''Dragon Ball Super'' and ''Battle of Gods''. Tetsuya Iwanaga provides the voice for the Elder Kai's younger self in flashbacks. In English he is voiced by [[Scott McNeil]] in the Ocean dub, by Steve Olson in the Blue Water dub, and by Kent Williams in the Funimation dubs.\n\n====Universe 10====\nGowasu (\u30b4\u30ef\u30b9), known as Gowas in the manga, is the ruling Supreme Kai of Universe 10. At some point in time in the past, Gowasu chose Zamasu, the North Kai of Universe 10, to be his successor based on his battle talent, a decision he would later regret as he chose an apprentice without noticing the potential for evil within him. Unlike many of his peers from the other Universes, he does not resent Goku or view him as being disrespectful, as he is the only deity outside of Universe 6 and Universe 7 who actually knows him on a personal level. Gowasu, along with his counterpart from Universe 7, traveled to an alternate future world where Zamasu has ravaged the world to assist Goku and his associates in dealing with his former apprentice. During the Tournament of Power arc, Gowasu is shown recruiting team members to fight on behalf of Universe 10, as well as recording and uploading their exploits on a channel known as \"GodTube\".\n\nIn an alternate future timeline, Zamasu succeeds Gowasu as the ruling Supreme Kai of Universe 10 after he successfully assassinates the latter.\n\nGowasu is voiced by Tetsuo Goto in the Japanese version and by Garrett Schenck in the Funimation dub.\n\n===Zeno {{anchor|Zen.C5.8D}}===\nGrand Zeno ({{Nihongo|Zen\u014d|\u5168\u738b}}, lit. \"King of All\"), also known as the Omni-King and as the Lord of Everything in Viz's English manga, is the supreme deity of the whole ''Dragon Ball'' multiverse. Depicted as a childlike humanoid figure, Zeno ranks above all other mortals and gods in the series and has the power to erase entire universes from existence at will. He is served by a pair of identical-looking attendants and is advised by Grand Minister. First appearing during the aftermath of the Tournament of Destroyers between Universes 6 and 7, Zeno is treated with utmost reverence and fear by the other gods and mortals. He is addressed by his subjects as {{Nihongo|Zen\u014d-sama|\u5168\u738b\u69d8}} in original Japanese media, and Grand Zeno or the Omni-King in the English dub. Goku is a notable exception; he befriends and addresses Zeno in a casual manner (\"Zen-chan\" (\u5168\u3061\u3083\u3093) in the original Japanese, \"Zenny\" in the English dub), which is considered disrespectful and lacking in etiquette by most characters in the series. Part of the caution others have around Zeno comes from the fact that he acts and behaves like a child, destroying entire planets and universes out of amusement or dismay. Since the ''[[List_of_Dragon_Ball_Super_episodes#\"Future\"_Trunks_Saga_(2016\u20132017)|\"Future\" Trunks Saga]]'', there are two coequal Zenos. Zeno is voiced by [[Satomi K\u014drogi]] in Japanese and by Sarah Wiedenheft in English.\n\n====Grand Minister====\nThe {{nihongo4|Grand Minister|\u5927\u795e\u5b98|daishinkan}}, also known as the Grand Priest in Viz's English manga is an angelic being who serves as a close adviser and guiding figure to Zeno. He is the father of all twelve Angels in the multiverse. The Grand Minister's principal tasks are to implement Zeno's decrees and welcome guests to his palace. During the Zeno Expo and the Tournament of Power, the Grand Minister served as the referee.\n\nThe character is voiced by Masaya Takatsuka in the Japanese version and by [[Josh Grelle]] in the Funimation dub.\n\n===Universe 6 inhabitants===\n{{Nihongo4|Universe 6|\u7b2c\uff16\u5b87\u5b99|''Dai roku Uch\u016b''}}, also known as the Challenging Universe (\u6311\u6226\u306e\u5b87\u5b99 ''Ch\u014dsen no Uch\u016b''), is the sixth of the twelve parallel universes introduced in ''Dragon Ball Super''; the God of Destruction is [[#Champa|Champa]], the Supreme Kai is {{nihongo|Fuwa|\u30d5\u30ef}}, and the Angel is [[#Vados|Vados]]. Universe 6 is linked with Universe 7 as twin universes, and that any planets or species that have existed and/or exist in Universe 7 will exist or are likely have existed in Universe 6, and vice versa. For example, the Saiyan people also exist in Universe 6, but their fates are completely different compared to their Universe 7 counterparts; they live relatively peaceful lives on their homeworld {{Nihongo4|Sadala|\u30b5\u30c0\u30e9|Sadara}}, and were never enslaved or wiped out by their enemies. Instead of conquering other planets, the Saiyans of Universe 6 tamed their desire to battle for good, and use their skills to protect the civilizations of their universe from danger and unrest.\n\nCharacters from this universe were the first outside of Universe 7 to be introduced upon the reveal of there being multiple other universes.\n\n====Auta Magetta====\n{{nihongo|Auta Magetta|\u30aa\u30c3\u30bf \u30de\u30b2\u30c3\u30bf|Otta Magetta}} is a Metalman from Universe 6.\n\nIn the Tournament of Destroyers, Auta Magetta competed in a tournament against Universe 7. He fought Vegeta where his lava-spewing abilities started to heat up the ring. After breaking the barrier, Vegeta recovered from the overheating and knocked Auta Megetta out of the ring.\n\nIn the Tournament of Power, Auta Magetta assisted Frost in attacking Vegeta and Master Roshi. Vegeta managed to knock him out of the ring after insulting him.\n\nAuta Magetta is voiced by Naoki Tatsuta in the Japanese version.\n\n====Botamo====\n{{nihongo|Botamo|\u30dc\u30bf\u30e2|Botamo}} is a tall yellow humanoid bear from Universe 6 with rubber skin that can withstand any punch.\n\nIn the Tournament of Destroyers, he faced off against Goku in the tournament against Universe 7. Goku had a hard time landing a blow on Botamo until he grabbed him by the arm and threw him out of the ring.\n\nIn the Tournament of Power, Botamo faced off against Gohan. The punches from Gohan started to lift Botamo off the ground until it was enough for Gohan to use the Kamehameha to blast Botamo out of the ring.\n\nBotamo is voiced by Yasuhiro Takato in the Japanese version and by Cris George in the Funimation dub.\n\n====Cabba====\n{{Nihongo4|Cabba|\u30ad\u30e3\u30d9|''Kyabe''}} is a Saiyan hailing from Planet Sadala and an elite member of the Sadala Defense Forces, first introduced in ''Dragon Ball Super''. Planet Sadala is also the original homeworld of the Saiyans of Universe 7, but according to [[Vegeta]], it has been destroyed by internal discord long ago and no longer exists. Unlike the arrogant and savage nature exhibited by the vast majority of Saiyans from Universe 7, Cabba is presented as a good-natured and humble individual who speaks respectfully to everyone and sees himself as a protector of the weak. As one of Universe 6's strongest warriors, he is recruited to join Champa's team during [[List of Dragon Ball Super episodes#Season 3: Universe 6 Saga|the Tournament of Destroyers]]. Cabba bonds with Vegeta following the events of the tournament and looks up to him as a mentor, in spite of the fact that they fight for opposing teams.\n\nHe is voiced by [[Daisuke Kishio]] in the Japanese version of the series. In the Funimation English Dub, his voice is supplied by [[Clifford Chapin]].\n\n====Champa====\n{{Nihongo4|Champa|\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3\u30d1|Shanpa}} is [[Beerus]]' twin brother and the God of Destruction of Universe 6, which is linked with the Seventh Universe as its \"twin universe\". He looks like an overweight version of Beerus and wears a variation of the traditional Egyptian clothing and ornaments Beerus is wearing and his name also derives from an alcoholic drink, {{Nihongo4|[[Champagne]]|\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3\u30d1\u30f3|Shanpan}}. He has a long-running rivalry with Beerus, and the brothers often bicker or engage in acts of [[one-upmanship]] like food contests and [[proxy war]]s. During the [[List of Dragon Ball Super episodes#Season 3: Universe 6 Saga|Universe 6 Saga]], Champa holds a fighting tournament known as the Tournament of Destroyers; he forms a team by gathering the strongest warriors from Universe 6 to challenge Universe 7, which consists of [[#Hit|Hit]], [[#Cabba|Cabba]], [[#Frost|Frost]], [[#Botamo|Botamo]], and [[#Auta Magetta|Auta Magetta]].\n\nChampa is voiced by [[Mitsuo Iwata]] in the Japanese version of the series. In the Funimation bub, his voice is supplied by [[Jason Liebrecht]].\n\n====Caulifla====\n{{Nihongo4|Caulifla|\u30ab\u30ea\u30d5\u30e9|''Karifura''}} is a Saiyan from Universe 6 and a member of Team Universe 6 who participates in the Tournament of Power. Brash and headstrong, she is the leader of a group of Saiyan punks. She shows a strong contrast to the rest of her people, acting more akin to the Universe 7 Saiyans who are known for being naturally aggressive and prideful. She also displays a love for getting stronger, which is evident after she heard from her Universe 7 counterparts about various advanced, more powerful forms a Saiyan could attain.\n\nCaulifla is voiced by Yuka Komatsu in the Japanese version and by [[Elizabeth Maxwell]] in the Funimation dub.\n\n====Frost====\n{{Nihongo4|Frost|\u30d5\u30ed\u30b9\u30c8|''Furosuto''}} is the ruler of an empire based in Universe 6, and hails from the same race of beings as Universe 7's [[Freeza|Frieza]]. He is first introduced in ''Dragon Ball Super'' as a competitor for his universe during the Tournament of Destroyers. Unlike Frieza, he is apparently perceived in a positive light by the majority of his subjects in Universe 6. Frost's characterization differs between the manga and anime adaptions of ''Dragon Ball Super'', being a malevolent being not unlike Frieza in the anime, while on the other hand the manga version of the character is simply amoral and unsportsmanlike. In the anime, Frost faces off against Goku, Piccolo and Vegeta in successive rounds in the tournament and defeats Goku and Piccolo by cheating and using his secret poison; Goku is allowed to return to the tournament after this is revealed and Frost is defeated by Vegeta. He is eventually exposed as a devious manipulator who feigns benevolence as a facade, and is in fact a space pirate and planet broker who discreetly profits from warmongering activities in his universe.\n\nIn the Tournament of Power, Frost meets Frieza before the tournament begins. He accompanied Auta Magetta in fighting Vegeta and Master Roshi. After a failed attempt to use the Evil Containment Wave on Vegeta, Frost fled. Then he met up with Frieza where they fought Gohan. Frieza then double-crosses Frost and blasts him out of the ring. When Frost tries to attack Frieza for double-crossing him, both Zenos erase Frost for violating the rules. This served as a warning to Champa to not let something like this happen again or else their entire universe will be erased. Frost is later restored when Android 17 uses the Super Dragon Balls to restore the erased universes.\n\nIn the manga, there is no mention of Frost being involved in criminal activities nor any indication of him being evil, and he appears to have a genuinely pleasant personality. He is indifferent to accusations of being a dirty fighter for using his poisonous stingers, as the tournament offers no prize money and the battles are ultimately pointless according to his perspective.\n\nFrost is voiced by [[Ry\u016bsei Nakao]] in the Japanese version of the series. In the Funimation English Dub, his voice is supplied by [[Greg Ayres]].\n\n====Hit====\n{{nihongo4|Hit|\u30d2\u30c3\u30c8|''Hitto''}}, also known as {{nihongo4|Hit the Infallible|\u767e\u767a\u767e\u4e2d\u306e\u30d2\u30c3\u30c8|Hyappatsuhyakuchuu no Hitto}} and as the {{nihongo4|Legendary Assassin|\u4f1d\u8aac\u306e\u6bba\u3057\u5c4b|Densetsu no Koroshi-ya}}, is an assassin from Universe 6 introduced in ''Dragon Ball Super''. He is known for using his signature {{nihongo|''Time-Skip''|\u6642\u3068\u3070\u3057|Toki-Tobashi}} ability to manipulate time and for his capability to eliminate his assassination targets with a single strike. Over a millennium old, he is the strongest member of his universe's team during [[List of Dragon Ball Super episodes#Season 3: Universe 6 Saga|the Tournament of Destroyers]]. Hit eventually rebels against [[#Champa|Champa]] and throws his fight against Monaka (\u30e2\u30ca\u30ab), easily the weakest participating member of the opposing Universe 7 team, by eliminating himself in the final match of the tournament.\n\nIn Japanese, Hit is voiced by [[Kazuhiro Yamaji]]. In the English dub, he is voiced [[Aaron Roberts]] in ''[[Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2]]'' and by [[Matthew Mercer]] in all subsequent appearances.\n\n====Kale====\n{{nihongo4|Kale|\u30b1\u30fc\u30eb|K\u0113ru}} is a Saiyan from Universe 6 and a member of Team Universe 6 who participates in the Tournament of Power. Kale is Caulifla's best friend, sister-figure, and prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Unlike most Saiyans who are assertive or at least strong-willed, Kale is by nature a very meek and timid individual. Her greatest desire is to fight alongside Caulifla as equals; her devotion to Caulifla have also become a strong trigger for her in battle. Much like [[Broly]] from Universe 7, she is the latest Legendary Saiyan of her universe, a demonic warrior who appears once every 1000 years. When accessing her Super Saiyan powers, Kale's personality becomes a polar opposite; shifting through emotions while in her berserker state, she would become excessively violent and savage, showing no mercy to anyone who stands in her way.\n\nKale is voiced by Yukana in the Japanese version and by Dawn M. Bennett in the English dub.\n\n====Vados====\n{{nihongo4|Vados|\u30f4\u30a1\u30c9\u30b9|Vadosu}}, the sister of [[#Whis|Whis]], is an Angel from Universe 6 who is the attendant and martial arts teacher of [[#Champa|Champa]]. Like Whis, her name is also derived from an alcoholic drink, {{nihongo4|[[calvados]]|\u30ab\u30eb\u30f4\u30a1\u30c9\u30b9|karuvadosu}}. In ''Dragon Ball Super'', she is first seen accompanying Champa while searching for the Super Dragon Balls; they are successful in obtaining six of the seven Super Dragon Balls prior to [[List of Dragon Ball Super episodes#Season 3: Universe 6 Saga|the Tournament of Destroyers]]. Vados openly displays concern with Champa's physique and health problems and often teases him for being overweight, blaming his weight issues as the cause of his low stamina and his difficulty in keeping up with her training. She is also shown to be polite and respectful, even when addressing lesser beings or those who are not from her universe such as Goku.\n\nVados is voiced by [[Yuriko Yamaguchi (voice actor)|Yuriko Yamaguchi]] in the Japanese version. In the English version, Vados is voiced by [[Caitlin Glass]] in the Funimation English dub and by [[Wendee Lee]] in the Bang Zoom! dub.\n\n===Universe 11 inhabitants===\n{{nihongo|Universe 11|\u7b2c\uff11\uff11\u5b87\u5b99|Dai j\u016bichi Uch\u016b}}, also known as the Justice Universe (\u6b63\u7fa9\u306e\u5b87\u5b99 ''S\u0113gi no Uch\u016b''), is the eleventh of the twelve parallel universes introduced in ''Dragon Ball Super''; the God of Destruction is Vermoud (known as Belmod in the anime), the Supreme Kai is {{nihongo|Khai|\u30ab\u30a4|Cae}}, and the Angel is {{nihongo4|Marcarita|\u30de\u30eb\u30ab\u30ea\u30fc\u30bf|Marukar\u012bta}}. Universe 11 is linked with Universe 2 as twin universes. The Pride Troopers (\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9\u30c8\u30eb\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30ba '' Puraido Tor\u016bp\u0101su'') are a very powerful superhero team who operate in this universe; they work under their God of Destruction, and the most elite Pride Troopers made up the entirety of Team Universe 11 participating in the Tournament of Power.\n\n====Belmod====\n{{Nihongo4|Belmod|\u30d9\u30eb\u30e2\u30c3\u30c9|Berumoddo}}, known as known as \"Vermoud\" in the Viz Media localization, is a scrawny humanoid in [[clown]] makeup and the God of Destruction of Universe 11. He dislikes evil and praises the work of the Pride Troopers. Top is his candidate for God of Destruction when Belmod retires. He is usually accompanied by his attendant and martial arts teacher Marcarita.\n\nBelmod is voiced by Masami Kikuchi in the Japanese version and by Markus Lloyd in the Funimation dub.\n\n====Dyspo====\n{{nihongo|Dyspo|\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30dd|Disupo}} is the [[Sphynx cat]]-like blitz captain of the Pride Troopers. In the Tournament of Power, he used his own super-speed when fighting Hit before retreating. During his fight with Frieza, Dyspo also fought against Gohan who sacrificed himself to get Dyspo out of the ring.\n\nDyspo is voiced by Bin Shimada in the Japanese version and by Christopher Dontrell Piper in the Funimation dub.\n\n====Jiren====\n{{nihongo|Jiren|\u30b8\u30ec\u30f3}}, also referred to as {{nihongo|\"Jiren The Gray\"|\u7070\u8272\u306e\u30b8\u30ec\u30f3|Haiiro no Jiren}}, is a [[gray alien]]-styled member of the Pride Troopers who served as a major contestant in the Tournament of Power. His quiet, stoic demeanor is but a glimpse of his solitary nature; he is haunted by his past losses and desperately tries to undo it all by forging his own path of justice. While fighting for justice, he has no loyalty to anyone beyond himself, believing that trusting in others will ultimately backfire. Jiren is very proud of his strength and refuses to accept the help of his comrades even in dire moments where he is under severe pressured from his opponents.\n\nJiren is voiced by Eiji Hanawa in the Japanese version and by [[Patrick Seitz]] in the Funimation dub.\n\n====Toppo====\n{{nihongo|Toppo|\u30c8\u30c3\u30dd}}, known as Top in the anime, is the tall and burly leader of the Pride Troopers, who act as guardians of peace within Universe 11 and formed the majority of participants representing Universe 11 in the Tournament of Power. A hot-blooded yet humble fighter who passionately believes in the concept of justice, Toppo is a candidate to become Universe 11's next God of Destruction, being the second most powerful mortal within his home universe after his comrade Jiren. His commitment to pursuing justice is further seen from his tendency to name his techniques as an extension of justice, such as the Justice Flash.\n\nTop is voiced by Kenji Nomura in the Japanese version and by Ray Hurd in the Funimation dub.\n\n==Anime-exclusive characters==\nThe manga's [[anime]] and film adaptations feature some original characters not created by Toriyama but by [[Toei Animation]] staff; the vast majority of the film adaptations in particular exist in their own unique continuities which branch off from the anime television series at various points, hence original characters introduced in the films are usually unknown to the characters in either or both of the official anime and manga series continuities.<ref>{{cite web |first= Richard|last= Eisenbeis|title=Dragon Ball Super: Broly|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/dragon-ball-super/broly/.140937|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=18 December 2018|accessdate= February 7, 2019}}</ref> Toriyama personally designed certain characters which made their debut appearances in the [[List of Dragon Ball films|animated films]],<ref name=\"Movies\">{{cite book |title=Dragon Ball \u5927\u5168\u96c6 6 Movies & TV Specials|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|pages=212\u2013216|year=1995|isbn=4-08-782756-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Dragon Ball \u30d5\u30eb\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc \u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30b6\u7de8 4|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|pages=240\u2013245|year=2013|isbn=978-4-08-870715-0}}</ref><ref>[http://www.kanzenshuu.com/production/toriyama/ Production Guide | Toriyama's Contributions to the Anime<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> such as [[Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug|Slug]], [[Dragon Ball Z: Cooler's Revenge#Cooler|Cooler]], [[Dragon Ball Z: Super Android 13!|Android 13]], [[Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan#Broly|Broly]], [[Dragon Ball Z: Bojack Unbound#Bojack|Bojack]], and [[Dragon Ball Z: Wrath of the Dragon#Tapion|Tapion]]. \n\n===Garlic Jr.===\n{{Nihongo4|Garlic Jr.|\u30ac\u30fc\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30b8\u30e5\u30cb\u30a2|G\u0101rikku Junia}} is a character that first appears in ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Dead Zone]]''.

Despite transforming into his final form, which is one transformation higher than his brother, he is defeated by Super Saiyan Goku. He returns in the sixth film, his remains having combined with the {{nihongo4|Big Gete Star|\u30d3\u30c3\u30b0\u30b2\u30c6\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc|Biggu Gete Sut\u0101}}, a sentient planet-sized machine.

Originally known as T2006 or DB4649T2006RS, Giru is a Machine Mutant, fully mechanical beings with organic properties: they can mold, contort, and reshape themselves like organic lifeforms, absorb and integrate metallic and mechanical materials into their own being, as well as restructuring themselves. He is encountered by Goku, Pan and Trunks on Imecka. Giru consumes their Dragon Radar for energy in an act of desperation for survival, inadvertably integrating the Dragon Radar's functionality into his software. Giru joins Goku's group and accompanies them to various planets in the galaxy on their quest to find the Black Star Dragon Balls. Giru would become good friends with Pan in the series; however, he is frequently the recipient of abuse, both verbal and physical, at the hands of Pan, which makes him somewhat fearful of her. Giru plays a pivotal role during the group's encounter with his creator [[#Doctor Myuu|Doctor Myuu]] as well as the parasitic [[#Baby|Baby]] on the planet M-2, and aids them in their subsequent struggle against the villains. During the Shadow Dragons arc, Giru accompanies Goku and Pan to search for the seven Shadow Dragons using his built-in Dragon Radar functionality to track the creatures. He is voiced by [[Shinobu Satouchi]] in Japanese media and by [[Sonny Strait]] in the Funimation anime dub.\n\n====Doctor Myuu====\n{{Nihongo4|Doctor Myuu|\u30c9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30df\u30e5\u30fc|Dokut\u0101 My\u016b}}  is a recurring antagonistic character that first appears in the 13th episode of ''Dragon Ball GT''.

His plans are eventually foiled by Goku, Pan and Trunks after they arrive on the planet M-2 and defeat most of his minions. Myuu escapes and evades Goku and his companions after Baby's apparent defeat, only to be killed when Baby suddenly emerges from his body. It is then revealed that Baby was the one who created and programmed Dr. Myuu, and not the other way around. He later joins forces with [[#Doctor Gero|Doctor Gero]] while in Hell to create a duplicate of [[Android 17]] using Myuu's machine mutant technology, who then manipulates the original Android 17 into converging their power together to open a rift between Earth and Hell, enabling him and his co-creators to escape. Android 17 and his machine mutant duplicate eventually fuse together to become Super 17, who subsequently turns on and murders both Gero and Myuu. He is voiced by [[Kazuyuki Sogabe]] in Japanese media and [[Duncan Brannan]] in the Funimation anime dub.\n\n====Baby====\n{{Nihongo4|Baby|\u30d9\u30d3\u30fc|Beb\u012b}} is a character that first appears in the 22nd episode of ''Dragon Ball GT''.

Baby desires to exterminate all of the Saiyans to avenge the extinction of his people and the loss of their homeworld to the Saiyans. Baby is first reactivated from a sleep state by [[#Doctor Myuu|Doctor Myuu]]; he attempts to fight Goku, Trunks, and Pan, but is easily defeated. To Buust his power, Baby infects various people with his DNA and begins gathering energy from them. After a second defeat at the hands of the three Saiyans, Baby infects Trunks and travels to Earth with his unsuspecting host. On Earth he battles Goten and Gohan, infects them both, and is able to infect Vegeta and make him his primary host. Goku, Trunks, and Pan return to Earth to find the entire population is now under Baby's control. Baby is able to defeat Goku, then he begins using the Black Star Dragon Balls to restore the planet Tuffle and transport the Earth population to it. During this time, Baby evolves into an even more powerful form and defeats Goku again. This causes Goku to transform into a Golden Great Ape and then into a Super Saiyan 4. In this new form, Goku is able to defeat \"Baby-Vegeta\". He has Bulma, also under his control, fire a radiation beam at him from her Blutz Wave Generator which enables him to transform into a Golden Great Ape as well. After a lengthy battle, Baby separates from Vegeta and attempts to escape in a spaceship, vowing to return to destroy the Saiyans. Goku blasts the spaceship with a ''10x Kamehameha'' attack, sending it into the sun. The ship is destroyed and Baby is obliterated.

When attempting to undo the damage caused by Super 17, the cigar-smoking Black Smoke Shenron, [[#Shenron|Evil Shenron]] in Japanese, is summoned from the Dragon Balls instead of the regular Shenron. He splits out the tainted Dragon Balls before fading away, each manifesting into one of the seven dragons as they proceed to cause chaos across the world. They are named after the One-Star through Seven-Star Dragon Balls; {{nihongo4|One-Star Dragon|\u4e00\u661f\u9f8d|\u012ashinron|Chinese: Y\u012b X\u012bng L\u00f3ng}}, {{nihongo4|Two-Star Dragon|\u4e8c\u661f\u9f8d|Ryanshinron|Chinese: \u00c8r X\u012bng L\u00f3ng}}, {{nihongo4|Three-Star Dragon|\u4e09\u661f\u9f8d|Sanshinron|Chinese: S\u0101n X\u012bng L\u00f3ng}}, {{nihongo4|Four-Star Dragon|\u56db\u661f\u9f8d|S\u016bshinron|Chinese: S\u00ec X\u012bng L\u00f3ng}}, {{nihongo4|Five-Star Dragon|\u4e94\u661f\u9f8d|\u016ashinron|Chinese: W\u01d4 X\u012bng L\u00f3ng}}, {{nihongo4|Six-Star Dragon|\u516d\u661f\u9f8d|Ry\u016bshinron|Chinese: Li\u00f9 X\u012bng L\u00f3ng}}, and {{nihongo4|Seven-Star Dragon|\u4e03\u661f\u9f8d|Ch\u012bshinron|Chinese: Q\u012b X\u012bng L\u00f3ng}}. In the English dubs their names are changed to Syn Shenron, Haze Shenron, Eis Shenron, Nuova Shenron, Rage Shenron, Oceanus Shenron, and Naturon Shenron respectively. Goku, Pan and Giru manage to defeat the other dragons before encountering Eis and Nuova Shenron. Being much more honorable than his siblings, Nuova helps Goku defeat Eis. However, Syn Shenron kills Nuova before absorbing both his Dragon Ball and the others as well to increase his power.\n\nSyn Sheron, or the One-Star Dragon, was created as the result of Mr. Popo's wish with Earth's Dragon balls to revive everyone on Namek that died at the hands of Frieza and his forces. The nature of the wish in turn made Syn Sheron both the most powerful and most evil of the Shadow Dragons. Making himself known after the death of Eis Shenron, killing Nuova Shenron in the process, Syn Shenron manages to swallow the other six Dragon Balls to become Omega Sheron, {{nihongo4|Super One-Star Dragon|\u8d85\u4e00\u661f\u9f8d|S\u016bp\u0101 \u012ashinron}} in Japanese, with access to all of the abilities of his Shadow Dragon brethren.

The series takes place in a fictional universe, the same world as Toriyama's previous series ''[[Dr. Slump]]'', and follows the adventures of [[Goku|Son Goku]] during his boyhood years as he trains in martial arts and explores a fantastical version of [[Earth]] (\u5730\u7403 ''Chiky\u016b'') in search of the seven orbs known as the Dragon Balls that are used to summon a wish-granting dragon. The tone of the series becomes more action oriented and less comedic when Goku reaches adulthood, as he and his allies would find themselves defending Earth against various threats, overcoming seemingly insurmountable opponents and eventually emerging victorious against progressively more powerful foes.\n\nDuring the course of the story, Goku encounters allies such as [[Bulma]], [[Master Roshi]], and [[Trunks (Dragon Ball)|Trunks]], rivals such as [[Tien Shinhan]], [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]], and [[Vegeta]], and villains such as [[Frieza]], [[Cell (Dragon Ball)|Cell]] and [[Majin Buu]].

It is mainly inhabited by Earthlings (\u5730\u7403\u4eba ''Chiky\u016bjin''), a term used inclusively to refer to all of the intelligent races native to the planet, including humans, anthropomorphic beings, and monsters. Earthlings play a predominant role in almost every media in the Dragon Ball franchise, a result of Earth's pride of place as the series' primary setting.

First introduced as a young boy, Goku was originally conceived by creator Akira Toriyama as a variation of [[Sun Wukong]], protagonist of the Chinese novel ''Journey to the West''; wherefore Goku also sported a prehensile tail until later. Upon meeting Bulma at the beginning of the series, the two then embark on an adventure to gather the seven Dragon Balls.{{gnr|ch|1}} After, Goku receives martial arts training from Master Roshi, meeting his lifelong friend Krillin and learning the famous ''Kamehameha'' technique, and enters the World Martial Arts Tournament to fight the strongest warriors on the planet. When the evil [[#Piccolo Daimao|King Piccolo]], and later his offspring [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]], tries to conquer the planet, Goku receives training from Earth's deities to defeat them.\n\nThough he appears human, it is later revealed that Goku is descended from an alien warrior race known as the Saiyans, who sent him, originally named Kakarot, to Earth to prepare it for conquest.{{gnr|ch|197}} Goku sacrifices his life to save the planet from his brother [[#Raditz|Raditz]],{{gnr|ch|205}} but must quickly get stronger in the afterlife under the tutelage of [[#Kai\u014d-sama|King Kai]], to save it from the other incoming Saiyans [[#Nappa|Nappa]] and [[Vegeta]]. He later becomes a Super Saiyan and defeats a powerful tyrant [[Frieza]]. This sets the tone of the rest of the series, with each enemy the characters face becoming stronger than the last, requiring them to attain further training. The last battle of the original manga, against [[Majin Buu]], has the entire universe at stake, and as such, has Goku and friends being asked for help from the gods of the universe, the [[#Kai\u014dshin|Supreme Kai]].\n\n===Bulma===\n{{main|Bulma}}\n{{nihongo4|Bulma|\u30d6\u30eb\u30de|Buruma}} first appears as a teenager, using the Dragon Radar, a fictional device she created to detect the energy signal emitted by Dragon Balls.

Bulma has also assumed the role of inventor, providing critical tech support to Goku and his friends with their battles against various enemies and threats.

Despite his lechery and occasional whimsy or foolishness he is often depicted as wise, cantankerous, and perceptive. He is often accompanied by his talking sea turtle companion, referred to as {{nihongo4|Umigame|\u30a6\u30df\u30ac\u30e1||\"Sea Turtle\"}}, who often tries to point out his faulty ways. He is bald, sports a thick [[van dyke beard]], and wears sunglasses, beach clothes, or martial arts suits. He usually wields a walking stick and, in early appearances, wears a turtle's shell on his back. When wishing to appear anonymously in the World Martial Arts Tournament, Master Roshi uses the name {{Nihongo4|\"Jackie Chun\"|\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u30fb\u30c1\u30e5\u30f3|Jakk\u012b Chun}}, wears a wig and discards his sunglasses.{{gnr|ch|46}} Master Roshi was trained by Master Mutaito (\u6b66\u6cf0\u6597), who have also trained his [[Cohort (educational group)|cohortian]]-turned-rival {{Nihongo4|Tsuru-Sen'nin|\u9db4\u4ed9\u4eba||\"Crane Hermit\"}}; he has also received additional training from [[#Korin|Korin]]. {{gnr|ch|135|, |88}}\n\n===Yamcha===\n{{Main|Yamcha}}\n{{Nihongo4|Yamcha|\u30e4\u30e0\u30c1\u30e3|Yamucha}}, known as Zedaki in the [[Harmony Gold USA|Harmony Gold]] dub, is introduced as a desert [[bandit]] alongside his constant companion [[#Puar|Puar]], trying to steal [[Goku]] and [[Bulma]]'s Dragon Balls and wish not to feel nervous when near women.{{gnr|ch|8|, |9}} He eventually becomes Goku's ally and begins a relationship with Bulma, and later becomes a pupil of [[Master Roshi]].{{gnr|ch|23|, |112}} His signature attack is the {{nihongo4|''R\u014dgaf\u016bf\u016bken''|\u72fc\u7259\u98a8\u98a8\u62f3||\"Fist of the Wolf Fang\", rearranged as \"Wolf Fang Fist\" in the Funimation dub}}, a physical barrage of punches and palm strikes, ending with a double palm strike.{{gnr|ch|8}} As a result of training under Master Roshi, Yamcha is able to perform the ''Kamehameha'' and develops the {{nihongo4|''S\u014dkidan''|\u7e70\u6c17\u5f3e||\"Spinning Chi Bullet\"}}, an energy sphere directed by [[psychokinesis]].{{gnr|ch|117|, |175}} He also later trains under [[#Kami|Kami]] to prepare for the impending Saiyan invasion, but dies against one of their [[#Napp|Saibamen]].{{gnr|ch|209|, |215}} Before being wished back to life by the [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Shenlong|Namekian Dragon Balls]], he trained under [[#Kai\u014d|King Kai]] in the afterlife.{{gnr|ch|261|, |329}} He then helps out during the battles with the [[#Doctor Gero|Red Ribbon Androids]] and [[#Cell|Cell]], but for the most part does not participate in fighting.\n\n===Krillin===\n{{Main|Krillin}}\n{{nihongo4|Kuririn|\u30af\u30ea\u30ea\u30f3}}, Krillin in the English anime dub, is a bald martial artist and one of [[Goku]]'s best friends.

A purple catlike being seen wearing traditional [[Egyptian culture|Egyptian]] clothing and ornaments, he is a [[#God of Destruction|God of Destruction]] whose occupation is to maintain balance, who destroy planets, civilizations or external threats that put the development of the universe the deity oversees at risk. As a God of Destruction, he is capable of obliterating any target he desires, be it a living or undead being, an inert construct, or even an entire planet (or a specific portion at the deity's whim). His role is contrasted by the Supreme Kai who create and preserve them; together they rule over their respective universes and work with each other in order to maintain the balance of their respective universes. Because the Gods of Creation and Destruction share their life-force with each other, a Destroyer will die if their Supreme Kai counterpart perishes. \n\nContrary to what his title suggests, Beerus is not a villain, though he does find enjoyment in causing destruction. This is the main reason why Goku is unfazed by his actions. Goku understands that it is his job to destroy in order to maintain balance, and therefore respects him because of it. Often depicted as destroying planets (or half of one) in a whimsical manner, Beerus' two sole desires are enjoying the universe's finest cooking and fighting opponents who he considers to be worthy. The latter ultimately leads him to look for the Super Saiyan God who turns out to be one of the Saiyans now living on Earth. Eventually, [[Goku|Son Goku]] undertakes a ritual transformation into the Super Saiyan God and fights Beerus, just to be defeated by the God of Destruction. Having enjoyed the match, Beerus spares both Goku and the Earth, saying that Goku was the second strongest opponent he ever faced; first being his caretaker and martial arts teacher, [[#Whis|Whis]]. Beerus later forms a team consisting of Goku, [[Vegeta]], [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]], [[Majin Buu|Buu]], and Monaka (\u30e2\u30ca\u30ab) to participate in the [[List of Dragon Ball Super episodes#Season 3: Universe 6 Saga|Tournament of Destroyers]] after answering a challenge by his brother and fellow God of Destruction Champa.

A tall teal humanoid with pronounced effeminate features, he is an {{nihongo|Angel|\u5929\u4f7f|''Tenshi''}}, a being of extremely high status within the multiverse hierarchy. Each Angel is bound to the service of a God of Destruction of their respective universes, and rarely leaves them unaccompanied. Their role is to guide their deity to master their destructive capabilities, train their deity in martial arts and also to perform trivial duties such as preparing meals for their deity. They are tasked with supervising their deity and keeping them in check, and will intervene when they go too far. \n\nWhis is [[Beerus]]' martial arts teacher who always accompanies him wherever he goes. He is unmatched in power and possesses tremendous speed, effortlessly defending himself against Goku and Vegeta and when training the two for the fight against the resurrected Frieza. As an attendant to his universe's God of Destruction, Whis is responsible for monitoring Beerus and keeping him in line; for example, he would not permit him to engage his brother and long time rival Champa in any physical fight, as it is said that both of their respective universes will be destroyed should their fighting escalate.\n\nThe character's name stems from a misunderstanding. Toriyama incorrectly believed that Beerus' name was a pun on the word \"''beer''\" and so decided to follow the same rule to name the character's assistant. Thus, he ended up naming the character Whis, a pun on {{nihongo4|\"''whisky''\"|\u30a6\u30a4\u30b9\u30ad\u30fc|uisuk\u012b}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asahi.com/culture/update/0329/TKY201303290330.html |title=\u65b0\u4f5c\u6620\u753b\u300c\u539f\u4f5c\u8005\u306e\u610f\u5730\u300d\u3000\u9ce5\u5c71\u660e\u3055\u3093\u72ec\u5360\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc |language=Japanese |trans-title=New film by the \"stubborn manga writer\" Akira Toriyama; exclusive interview |work=[[Asahi Shimbun]] |date=March 30, 2013 |accessdate=July 22, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501075658/http://www.asahi.com/culture/update/0329/TKY201303290330.html |archivedate=May 1, 2013}}</ref> Whis is voiced by [[Masakazu Morita]] in Japanese media<ref name=\"Super\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-06-15/dragon-ball-super-main-visual-reveals-2-new-characters/.89281|title=Dragon Ball Super Main Visual Reveals 2 New Characters|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2015-06-15|accessdate=2015-06-15}}</ref> and [[Ian Sinclair (voice actor)|Ian Sinclair]] in the Funimation dub.\n\n==Antagonists==\n===Red Ribbon Army===\n[[File:Red Ribbon Army Logo.png|thumb|Red Ribbon Army logo]]\nThe {{Nihongo4|Red Ribbon Army|\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30ea\u30dc\u30f3\u8ecd|Reddo Ribon Gun}} is a paramilitary organization led by {{Nihongo4|Commander Red|\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u7dcf\u5e25|Reddo-S\u014dsui}}, a short man who has his forces raid towns in search for the Dragon Balls on a quest for world domination.

The organisation controlled a majority of Universe 7 at the peak of its power and serves as the primary antagonistic force of the first half of the ''Dragon Ball Z'' series. Frieza's father, {{nihongo4|King Cold|\u30b3\u30eb\u30c9\u5927\u738b|Korudo Dai\u014d}} was the leader of the organisation prior to passing control over to his son.\n\nThe organisation employs and enslaves powerful races, such as the Saiyans, to take over suitable planets so that they can be sold to the highest bidders, or alternatively to destroy planets which are determined to be not financially viable. Frieza's forces are equipped with scouters, portable computers mainly used to measure power levels, and wear standard-issue battle armor which usually have dual shoulder guards, matching gloves and Buuts, and some form of skirt armor or crotch guard.\n\nFrieza himself does not really consider his soldiers as an army, looking at them more as a convenient group of followers. In reality, the soldiers follow him and his relatives out of fear, though some soldiers are known to be fiercely loyal to Frieza such as the Ginyu Force.\n\n====Frieza====\n{{Main|Frieza}}\nThe self-styled emperor of Universe 7, Frieza first appears on Planet Namek, where he systematically eradicates most of the entire native [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Namekians|Namekian]] population in his quest to obtain the Dragon Balls so that he can wish for eternal life{{gnr|ch|249}}. It is eventually revealed that Frieza was responsible for destroying the Saiyan planet Vegeta, killing all but a few Saiyans, as he had feared their power.{{gnr|ch|257}} However, he retains three of them, [[Vegeta]], [[#Nappa|Nappa]] and [[#Raditz|Raditz]], as his underlings. Frieza later engages Goku and his associates in a protracted battle, with Goku transforming into a Super Saiyan after Frieza murders Krillin.{{gnr|ch|317}} Out of anger and frustration at his inability to counter Goku's newfound power, Frieza blasted a hole into Namek's core in order to destroy the planet.{{gnr|ch|320}} Frieza is then sliced in half by his own attack and begs for mercy, with Goku giving him some of his surplus energy.{{gnr|ch|326}} After he uses that energy to attack, Goku then seemingly kills Frieza.{{gnr|ch|327}} He is later rebuilt with cybernetic body parts and travels to Earth with his father King Cold and their forces to seek revenge, but all of them are eliminated with ease by Trunks who traveled back in time from the future.{{gnr|ch|331|, |332}} After the deaths of Frieza and Cold, the army soon fell into shambles and split into several factions.\n\nIn ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F']]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]'' series, one of Frieza's loyal officers named {{nihongo4|Sorbet|\u30bd\u30eb\u30d9|Sorube}} travels to Earth along with his subordinate {{nihongo4|Tagoma|\u30bf\u30b4\u30de}} to resurrect their master by using Earth's Dragon Balls to summon [[#Shenron|Shenron]].<ref name=\"ANN announcement\">{{cite web|title=1st Key Visual For 2015 Dragon Ball Z Film Reveals Frieza|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-11-17/1st-key-visual-for-2015-dragon-ball-z-film-reveals-frieza/.81112|website=[[Anime News Network]]|date=November 17, 2014|accessdate=November 17, 2014}}</ref> Frieza takes his time to recuperate and train, and is later accompanied by Sorbet and a thousand-strong military force for his journey back to Earth to once again exact revenge on Goku and his family and friends. Sorbet was killed by his own master's ''ki'' blast towards the end of the battle, which was intended for Krillin but was deflected by Vegeta. Even though Frieza utilizes a powerful new form developed as a result of intensive training, Goku defeats him once again and sends him back to Hell. A deceased Frieza is later recruited by Goku to participate in the Tournament of Power (\u529b\u306e\u5927\u4f1a ''Chikara no Taikai'', lit. \"Convention of Power\") as a member of Team Universe 7.\n\n====Raditz====\n{{Nihongo4|Raditz|\u30e9\u30c7\u30a3\u30c3\u30c4|Radittsu}} is a Saiyan warrior and the older brother of Goku.{{gnr|ch|197}} Raditz is one of the few remaining Saiyans following the destruction of their homeworld, planet Vegeta.{{gnr|ch|197}} He arrives on Earth, searching for his long-lost brother in order to recruit him in conquering other planets.{{gnr|ch|196}} When Goku refuses, Raditz kidnaps his nephew, Gohan, and orders Goku to kill 100 Earthlings within a day if he wants his son back.{{gnr|ch|197}} Instead, Goku and Piccolo team up to defeat Raditz, though not even their combined powers are enough.{{gnr|ch|198|, |200}} However, Goku makes the ultimate sacrifice by grappling with Raditz and allowing Piccolo to kill them both with his ''Makankosappo'' technique.{{gnr|ch|205}} Before Raditz dies, Piccolo taunts him by explaining that Goku will be revived by the Dragon Balls, though Raditz manages to send one final transmission to inform Vegeta and Nappa of this, believing that his Saiyan comrades will come to Earth and use the Dragon Balls to revive him.{{gnr|ch|204}} However, Vegeta and Nappa travel to Earth to use the Dragon Balls for their own purposes instead. In the anime, Raditz later makes a minor appearance in ''Dragon Ball GT'' along with many of the other villains who escaped Hell. He also makes a single panel appearance in Toriyama's 2014 ''[[Dragon Ball Minus: The Departure of the Fated Child]]'' special.<ref name=\"Fated\"/> He is voiced by [[Shigeru Chiba]] in Japanese,<ref name=\"Chiba\"/> [[Jason Gray-Stanford]] in the Ocean dub, and [[Justin Cook]] in the Funimation dub.\n\n====Nappa====\n{{nihongo4|Nappa|\u30ca\u30c3\u30d1}} is one of the few remaining Saiyans that were known to survive the destruction of their homeworld, Planet Vegeta.{{gnr|ch|197}} An elite Saiyan warrior, Nappa uses Saibamen (\u683d\u57f9\u30de\u30f3 ''Saibaiman'', lit. \"Cultivation Man\") as grunts to root out weaker opponents or to assess an opponent's power and skill level; known as Cultivars in the Viz translation of the manga, the Saibamen are green humanoid creatures that grow from a planted seed placed in the ground, which are stored in a special liquid prior to their use. Nappa encounters the Dragon Team after he traveled to Earth with the Saiyan prince Vegeta in search of the Dragon Balls. He survives Chiaotzu's self-destructing attack, causes Tien Shinhan to die of exhaustion and kills Piccolo.{{gnr|ch|217|, |218|, |223}} He eventually meets his match against Goku, who had returned to Earth after receiving intensive training from [[#Kai\u014d|King Kai]]. Upon discovering that Goku's new power level is [[It's Over 9000!|well over 8000]], Vegeta orders Nappa to stop fighting due to Goku's clear dominance over him, but he refuses and is incapacitated by Goku.{{gnr|ch|226}} Seeing that Nappa has been defeated, Vegeta mercilessly kills him himself.{{gnr|ch|227}} In ''Dragon Ball GT'', Nappa briefly returned as one of the escapees from Hell, only to be killed by Vegeta once more. In Japanese he is voiced by [[Sh\u014dz\u014d Iizuka]] in ''Dragon Ball Z'', [[Kiyoyuki Yanada]] in ''Dragon Ball GT'', and [[Tetsu Inada]] in ''Dragon Ball Kai''. In English he is voiced by [[Michael Dobson (actor)|Michael Dobson]] in the Ocean dub, and by [[Christopher Sabat]] and [[Phil Parsons (voice actor)|Phil Parsons]] in the Funimation dubs.\n\n====Zarbon and Dodoria====\n{{Nihongo4|Zarbon|\u30b6\u30fc\u30dc\u30f3|Z\u0101bon}} and Dodoria (\u30c9\u30c9\u30ea\u30a2) are two of [[Freeza|Frieza]]'s top ranking henchmen, first seen alongside their master on Planet Namek collecting the planet's Dragon Balls. Dodoria's demeanour is brutish and vulgar, while Zarbon appears to be a handsome, long-haired humanoid alien with a refined temperament. Bulma is blinded by her attraction to Zarbon's uncommon physical beauty during their initial encounter, and initially mistakes him for an ally. While their former cohort [[Vegeta]] have little difficulty dispatching Dodoria, who inadvertably revealed to Vegeta that Frieza was ultimately responsible for the destruction of the Saiyan homeworld, Zarbon manages to defeat and capture him after transforming into a powerful reptilian beast following their initial encounter.{{gnr|ch|263}} After Zarbon retrieves Vegeta's battered body and brings him to Frieza's ship in order to heal him for interrogation, Vegeta manages to escape and steal Frieza's Dragon Balls.{{gnr|ch|264|\u2013|266}} Zarbon sets out to find him once again, but Vegeta, having become stronger after experiencing the effects of a Saiyan genetic trait which increases his power level substantially following recovery from a near death experience, kills Zarbon in his beastly form.{{gnr|ch|268}}\n\nThe duo have been referenced in ''Dragon Ball Super'' and make cameo appearances in flashbacks. They also appear in ''[[Bardock - The Father of Goku]]'', where Zarbon advises Frieza to destroy the Saiyan homeworld, and Dodoria massacred Bardock's teammates. Both also make cameo appearances in ''Dragon Ball GT'' when they escape from Hell along with various other villains.

Though physically some of the strongest individuals in the universe, the Ginyu Force's members delight in coming up with strange poses, betting candy on fights, and playing [[Janken]]. Frieza calls upon them to assist in the defeat of Vegeta and help obtain the Dragon Balls on Planet Namek.{{gnr|ch|272}} In the anime, the four deceased members of the Ginyu Force (sans their leader, Captain Ginyu, who was still alive) appear at King Kai's planet in the afterlife and battle Tien Shinhan, Yamcha and Chiaotzu, who defeat and knock them down to Hell after a short skirmish. Tien Shinhan defeats Jeice and Burter, Yamcha defeats Recoome, and Chiaotzu defeats Guldo. King Kai reveals that he actually invited the Ginyu Force there in order to test their new strength subsequent to his training.\n\n{{Nihongo4|Gurd|\u30b0\u30eb\u30c9|Gurudo}}, named Guldo in the English anime dub, is a fat, short, four-eyed, green-skinned humanoid who, although physically weak, has psychic powers, including the ability to freeze time for as long as he can hold his breath.{{gnr|ch|273}} He can also immobilize opponents and control objects with [[Psychokinesis|telekinesis]].{{gnr|ch|274}} He is the first one killed when Vegeta interrupts his fight with Krillin and Gohan and [[Decapitation|decapitates]] him.{{gnr|ch|274}} Guldo is voiced by [[K\u014dz\u014d Shioya]] in the original series and [[Yasuhiro Takato]] in ''Kai''.

He is shown to be the most tactically skilled, as he deduced that Goku was masking his true power level by simply watching him fight. After seeing Goku's increased power level when using the ''Kaio-ken'', Ginyu inflicts a near fatal injury on himself.{{gnr|ch|285|, |286}} He then uses his unique technique that allows him to switch bodies with anyone, leaving Goku with Ginyu's nearly dead body.{{gnr|ch|286|, |287}} Ginyu (as Goku) momentarily deceives Krillin, but has trouble fighting Krillin and Gohan when he realizes that he can not fully control Goku's power.{{gnr|ch|288|, |289}} Ginyu then tries to switch into Vegeta's body, but Goku intervenes getting his body back, and when Ginyu tries again, he inadvertently switches bodies with a Namekian frog Goku throws in the way.{{gnr|ch|290}} In ''Dragon Ball Super'', Ginyu is revealed to have survived the destruction of Planet Namek and escaped to Earth, although he is still trapped in the body of a Namekian frog. He takes the opportunity to swap bodies with one of Frieza's soldiers named Tagoma, but is killed by Vegeta not long afterwards. In ''Dragon Ball GT'', he is briefly seen among several escapees from Hell as they return to there after they're defeated by Goku and the others. Ginyu is voiced by [[Hideyuki Hori]] in the original series and [[Katsuyuki Konishi]] in ''Kai''.

He is an [[Synthetic life|artificial life form]] created using the [[Cell (biology)|cells]] of several characters from the series, including Goku, Piccolo and Frieza. As a result, Cell is able to perform techniques such as the ''Kamehameha'', which he gains from the cells of Goku.{{gnr|ch|363}} Cell evolves several times throughout his appearances; he originally evolves from a [[cicada]]-like form into his Imperfect form, which is still [[insect]]-like in appearance. Both his first form and his second Semi-Perfect form have a long tail that ends in a stinger-like appendage and allows it to absorb other organisms.{{gnr|ch|361}} The tail recedes under his wings in his final Perfect form, and he can use it to spawn Cell Juniors, minuscule childlike versions of himself. Requiring the androids [[Android 17|17]] and [[Android 18|18]] to evolve, he finds out that they are already dead in his timeline, so he kills the Trunks of his timeline and uses Trunks' time machine to travel back in time. He eventually absorbs both after many battles and ascends to his perfect form.{{gnr|ch|372|, |380|, |381}} He decides to hold the {{nihongo4|Cell Games|\u30bb\u30eb\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0|Seru G\u0113mu}}, a tournament in which he fights against Earth's strongest fighters.{{gnr|ch|389}} Cell manages to defeat Goku, but he is eventually killed by Gohan.{{gnr|ch|416}}\n\n===Broly===\n{{Main|Broly}}\n{{nihongo4|Broly|\u30d6\u30ed\u30ea\u30fc|Buror\u012b}} is a character that appeared as the main villain in the films ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Broly - The Legendary Super Saiyan|Broly - The Legendary Super Saiyan]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Broly Second Coming|Broly Second Coming]]''. His backstory was that he was born with a power greater than most elite adult Saiyans, and is mentally unsettled as an adult due to the crying of the infant Goku in the incubator next to him when they were born, traumatic events during his childhood (including nearly being executed as well as Frieza's genocide) and also in part due to his extreme power. He eventually becomes the {{nihongo4|\"Legendary Super Saiyan\"|\u4f1d\u8aac\u306e\u8d85\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba|Densetsu no Ch\u014d Saiya-jin}} told of in legends, with his destructive tendencies only being quelled by a special controlling device created by scientists for his father, {{Nihongo4|Paragus|\u30d1\u30e9\u30ac\u30b9|Paragasu}}. In the eighth film, after Paragus lures Vegeta, Goku, and their companions to another planet, Broly recalls Goku and goes into a rage, destroying the control device and becoming the unstoppable Legendary Super Saiyan. He effortlessly pummels Super Saiyan Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, and Trunks as well as Piccolo, before killing his father. He is eventually defeated by Goku, but somehow manages to make his way into an escape pod. In the tenth film, he lands on Earth and goes into a frozen state until the crying of Goku's son Goten awakens him. He is killed by Goku, Gohan and Goten by their combined ''Kamehameha'' attack after being blasted through the sun. In ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Bio-Broly|Bio-Broly]]'', blood samples make their way into the hands of an industrialist, who creates a clone of the original Broly. The clone eventually wakes up and becomes mixed with bio-liquid, mutating him into a creature known as {{Nihongo4|\"Bio-Broly\"|\u30d0\u30a4\u30aa\u30d6\u30ed\u30ea\u30fc|Baio Buror\u012b}}. He fought Goten, Trunks, Android 18, and Krillin, and is eventually defeated by a combined ''Kamehameha'' attack after his body is exposed to sea water and becomes [[petrifaction|petrified]] as a result. He is voiced by [[Bin Shimada]] in the Japanese films, and [[Vic Mignogna]] in the Funimation dub.\n\nA reworked version of Broly that fits into the official Dragon Ball series continuity appears in the animated film ''[[Dragon Ball Super: Broly]]''. This Broly's backstory and physical appearance have been updated by [[Akira Toriyama]], who had only created concept art of the original character for the Z films that featured him.

Dabura is first seen when Goku, Gohan, Vegeta, Piccolo and Krillin are led to Babidi's ship by Supreme Kai and his attendant Kibito to aid them in preventing Majin Buu's awakening. Dabura proved to be a formidable foe for the group, and is compared to [[Cell (Dragon Ball)|Cell in his perfect form]] in terms of power level; he obliterates [[#Kai\u014dshin|Kibito]] single-handedly, turns Piccolo and Krillin to stone by spitting at them, and aids Babidi in corrupting Vegeta with a spell. Not long after his successful awakening by Babidi, Buu would turn on Dabura by transmuting him into a large cookie and consumed him. This in turn reverts his petrification of Piccolo and Krillin, restoring them to normal. In a filler episode of the ''Dragon Ball Z'' anime, an apparently redeemed Dabura was shown accompanying Bulma, Chi-Chi and Videl in their search for Gohan in the afterlife. Dabura was sent to Heaven by the ruler of the afterlife since, being a demon, he would enjoy Hell. Dabura is referenced in Dragon Ball Super and appears in flashback scenes. Dabura is voiced by Ry\u016bzabur\u014d \u014ctomo in the Japanese version of the anime series.

They possess green skin and antennae on their bald heads, and are able to make their own set of Dragon Balls. During the era of the Dragon Ball series, there were just over a hundred Namekians alive on their home planet, as most of their kind had died off a generation prior from a great calamity. While extraterrestrial in origin, the first Namekian characters encountered by Goku, King Piccolo and his mutated offspring, were known as the Demon Clan and thought of more earthly origin by the rest of the world.\n\nNamekians are hermaphrodites that possess physiques similar to those of human males and are seen reproducing asexually using a mode of reproduction similar to the [[parthenogenesis]], by spitting an egg out from their mouths. Despite this asexual reproductive system, there is still diversity in the species as each offspring is usually not an exact copy of their parent, like with [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Piccolo Daima\u014d|King Piccolo]], or the {{nihongo4|Great Elder|\u6700\u9577\u8001|Saich\u014dr\u014d}}  who is the progenitor of every remaining Namekian on the planet prior to the events of ''Dragon Ball''. The Great Elder, known as Guru in the English anime, pass on his position as leader of the Namekian people on to {{nihongo4|Muri|\u30e0\u30fc\u30ea|}} prior to his passing later in the series.{{gnr|ch|327}}\n\nDuring [[List of Dragon Ball Z chapters#Volume list|sixth volume of the ''Dragon Ball Z'' manga]] or  [[Namek Saga|Nama Saga arc of the anime]], Planet Namek is terrorized by [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Freeza|Frieza]] and [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Freeza's Army|his army]]. The Namekian homeworld is ultimately destroyed by Frieza as a last-ditch effort to kill Goku. All surviving Namekians are temporarily transported to Earth, where they reside for nearly a year before being resettled on another planet called New Namek. Later in the series, the young Namekian named Dende becomes the guardian deity of Planet Earth and its Dragon Balls.\n\nThe Namekians exist in both Universe 6 and Universe 7. [[#List_of_Dragon_Ball_characters#Champa|Champa]] claims the Namekians of Universe 6 originally found the Super Dragon Balls and broke off pieces to create their own set of Dragon Balls.\n\n====Kami====\n{{Nihongo4|Kami|\u795e||lit. \"God\"}} is the creator of the Earth's Dragon Balls, and served as its guardian deity until the second half of the ''Dragon Ball Z'' series. The word \"kami\" is a generic term used by various characters throughout the series when referring to gods and deities in the original Japanese dialogue; this character is simply referred to as ''Kami'' (\u795e\u69d8), and his actual name is never revealed. He and [[#Piccolo Daima\u014d|King Piccolo]] were once one being, later revealed to be a Namekian, who expelled the evil inside him order to assume the mantle of Earth's guardian deity.{{gnr|ch|164}} The evil incarnation, King Piccolo, then went on to terrorize Earth until being sealed away by [[Master Roshi|Master Roshi's]] master, Mutaito. Because they are one, if either Kami or King Piccolo dies, then the other will as well and the Dragon Balls cease to exist.{{gnr|ch|165|, |207}} Shortly before King Piccolo dies at the hands of Goku, he spawns a much stronger incarnation, [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]], who takes over these same traits and retains his memories. Kami later attempts to attempt to seal away the new Piccolo himself using the same technique as Mutaito, and enters the 23rd World Martial Arts Tournament, possessing a human named {{Nihongo4|Shen|\u30b7\u30a7\u30f3||\"Hero\" in the English anime dub}} as a guise.{{gnr|ch|175|, |181}} But Piccolo has learned to reverse the technique and traps Kami in a water jug instead and swallows it, later being released thanks to Goku.{{gnr|ch|181|, |182|, |187}} During the fight against the Saiyans, Kami dies when Piccolo is killed by Nappa, but through the power of the Namekian Dragon Balls they both are wished back to life.{{gnr|ch|223|, |293}} During the Android Saga, Kami agrees to fuse with Piccolo, with Piccolo absorbing his energy, strength, memories, intelligence and thought pattern.{{gnr|ch|356|, |360}} A young Namekian named [[#Dende|Dende]] later succeeds him as the new Kami. He is voiced by [[Takeshi Aono]] in Japanese,<ref name=\"Aono\"/> who would do so up until the Frieza arc in ''Dragon Ball Kai''. After Aono suffered a stroke, [[Bin Shimada]] voiced the character for his final appearance during the Cell saga. In English he is voiced by [[Michael Dobson (actor)|Michael Dobson]] and [[Dale Wilson (actor)|Dale Wilson]] in the Ocean dub, and [[Christopher Sabat]] in the Funimation dub.\n\n====Dende====\n{{Nihongo4|Dende|\u30c7\u30f3\u30c7}} is a child of the Great Elder of Planet Namek. He was saved from [[Freeza|Frieza]]'s henchman Dodoria (\u30c9\u30c9\u30ea\u30a2) by Gohan and Krillin as a youth and taken into their care.{{gnr|ch|255}} Dende then guides Krillin to the Great Elder to tap into vast-hidden reserves of his power.{{gnr|ch|265}} He also interprets the Earthlings' wishes when utilizing the Namekian Dragon Balls, as the wish must be said in the native language of the Namekians.{{gnr|ch|292|, |293|, |324}} Dende later gains the power to heal injuries after having his own power unlocked by the Great Elder, which he uses to aid the warriors fighting Frieza until he is killed by the tyrant for being disruptive and helping the Earthlings.{{gnr|ch|299|, |304}} After being resurrected,{{gnr|ch|323}} Dende resides on New Namek until he is asked by Goku to become Earth's guardian deity.{{gnr|ch|393|, |394}} He accepts the position, revives Earth's inert Dragon Balls, and continues to serve as Earth's guardian deity throughout the rest of the series. Dende develops a close working relationship with [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]], as the latter had fused with fellow Namekians {{nihongo4|Nail|\u30cd\u30a4\u30eb|Neiru}}, whom Dende was friends with, and his [[#Kami|predecessor]].

After Buu is defeated, the two form a relationship, eventually having a daughter named Pan.{{gnr|ch|518}} When the two fight crime together afterwards, she takes on the role of the \"Great Saiyaman 2\" or \"Great Saiyawoman\".

As a toddler and later young child, she resembles her father: she has his eye shape and apparent lack of a nose. However, she does indeed have a nose, though small, and as she grows older, Marron begins to resemble her mother. Unlike her parents, Marron is not a martial artist and does not appear to possess any fighting ability or special powers. In Japanese media she was initially voiced by [[Tomiko Suzuki]], by [[Naoko Watanabe (voice actress)|Naoko Watanabe]] in the TV special ''[[Yo! Son Goku and His Friends Return!!]]'' and the ''Battle of Gods'' film, and by Hiroko Ushida in [[Dragon Ball Z Kai]] and [[Dragon Ball Super]].

After befriending Mr. Satan who convinced him of the error of his murderous ways, the Dai Supreme Kai's influence within Buu moved the creature to reform, leading him to expel his evil tendencies which become a different lifeform altogether. This aspect of Buu is identical in appearance to his chubby progenitor, although any malevolent behaviour previously displayed are gone; he is now a chidlike entity of good who is kind, caring, and is less likely to throw tantrums of anger. He is also much weaker in power, and lacks some of the original Majin Buu's unique capabilities. For example, he no longer needs to hibernate for incredibly long periods of time - instead entering an unwaking sleep for a brief period of time. Mr. Buu moves in with his best friend Mr. Satan after the original Majin Buu's demise, and continues to appear as a supporting character in subsequent ''Dragon Ball'' media.\n\n===Pan===\n{{Nihongo4|Pan|\u30d1\u30f3}} is the granddaughter of Goku and daughter of Gohan and Videl,{{gnr|ch|518}} as such her ancestry comes from both humans and the extraterrestrials called the Saiyans.

In ''Dragon Ball Super'', she easily defeats Vegeta when being controlled by her creators archenemy [[Dr. Mashirito]] and has a seemingly even match against Goku.\n\n===Bardock===\n{{Nihongo4|Bardock|\u30d0\u30fc\u30c0\u30c3\u30af|B\u0101dakku}}, Burdock in Viz's English manga translation, is the husband of {{nihongo4|Gine|\u30ae\u30cd}}, and the father of Raditz and Kakarrot (Goku). Bardock's story is shown in the [[Dragon Ball Z: Bardock - The Father of Goku|1990 ''Dragon Ball Z'' TV special]] and in Toriyama's 2014 ''[[Dragon Ball Minus: The Departure of the Fated Child]]'' special. In the TV special, during a routine planet conquering mission on the planet Kanassa, one of the surviving inhabitants strikes Bardock, giving him its native ability to see into the future in the process. Soon, Bardock began to see visions of Frieza's plan to destroy Planet Vegeta and all of the Saiyans, as well as Goku's future on Earth. Bardock attempts to prevent the destruction of his race by challenging Frieza in orbit of planet Vegeta, but is unsuccessful, and becomes the first of the Saiyans to be obliterated by Frieza. Before his death, however, Bardock has one final vision of Goku challenging Frieza, and is able to die pleased knowing his son would avenge their race. \n\nIn ''Dragon Ball Minus'', which takes place a month before the destruction of Planet Vegeta, Bardock has a strong feeling that Frieza is up to something when they receive an order for all Saiyans to return home, so he convinces Gine to send their infant son, Kakarrot, in a space pod to Earth, a planet far enough away to escape Frieza's interest, with a native population weak enough to pose no threat to Kakarot<ref name=\"Fated\">{{cite book |last=Toriyama |first=Akira |date=2015-01-06 |title=[[Jaco the Galactic Patrolman]] |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |pages=232\u2013247 |isbn= 978-1-4215-6630-6}}</ref>.

In English she is voiced by Ellen Kennedy in the Ocean dub, and by [[Linda Chambers-Young]] in the Funimation dub.\n\n===Fusion characters {{anchor|Fusion Characters}}===\nA recurring theme in the ''Dragon Ball series'' are characters created through the process of merging (\u5408\u4f53 ''gattai'', lit. \"union\") two or more separate beings into one. The idea to have two characters \"fuse\" together was suggested by Akira Toriyama's long-time friend and fellow manga artist [[Masakazu Katsura]], leading to the introduction of [[composite character|amalgamations of characters]] formed through various techniques. In the anime, the resulting fused characters tend to be depicted as speaking with a dual voice consisting of both fusees' voices.\n\nThe Fusion (\u30d5\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3 Fy\u016bjon) technique, first introduced when the threat of Majin Buu emerged, is a ritual dance developed by an alien species called the Metamorans which Goku learned in the Other World. The purpose of this technique is to temporarily merge two or more bodies into a single, superior entity with characteristics from both fusees. The newly fused body is dressed in Metamoran attire; a dark colored vest lined with light colored linen, white pants with a cloth belt and Buuts. When the ritual dance is performed properly, the single being created possesses an astounding level of power, far beyond what either fusee would have had individually by combining each other's attributes from strength and speed to reflexes, intelligence and wisdom. The resulting fusion only lasts up to 30 minutes, after which the fusees revert to their normal selves. Examples of characters created with this technique include {{nihongo4|Gotenks|\u30b4\u30c6\u30f3\u30af\u30b9|Gotenkusu}}, the fusion of Goten and Trunks; and {{nihongo4|Gogeta|\u30b4\u30b8\u30fc\u30bf|Goj\u012bta}}, the fusion of Goku and Vegeta.\n\nTwo individuals wearing a single matching Potara (\u30dd\u30bf\u30e9) earring but on opposite ears may trigger a {{nihongo4|Potara Fusion|\u30dd\u30bf\u30e9\u306e\u5408\u4f53|Potara no Gattai}}.<ref name=\"Movies\"/><ref>{{cite web| last1 = Kido| first1 = Misaki C.| last2 = Bae|first2 = John| title = Exclusive: Masakazu Katsura Spotlight|publisher=[[Viz Media]]| url = http://shonenjump.viz.com/node/178| accessdate = 2015-03-10| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140712150818/http://shonenjump.viz.com/node/178| archivedate = 2014-07-12}}</ref> These earrings, usually worn by the Supreme Kai and their aides, combine both users into a new body with complete attributes in the final product, as well as an increase in power and personality which is greater than the sum of the two individuals. Mortals have a one-hour time limit before the fusees de-fuse, but if a deity is one of the fusees, then the fusion will become permanent. However, there are alternate methods of dissolving the fusion regardless of whoever the participants are, usually by forcing the fusees apart (such as being magically split through a wish granted by Shenron). Examples of characters created by wearing a matching pair of Potara earrings include Kibito Kai, a fusion of [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Kai\u014dshin|Kibito and the East Supreme Kai of Universe 7]]; Vegito (\u30d9\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8 ''Bejitto''), a fusion of Goku and Vegeta also known as Vegerot in the Viz English manga; Kefla (\u30b1\u30d5\u30e9 ''Kefura''), a fusion of [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Kale|Kale]] and [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Caulifla|Caulifla]]; and Fused [[Zamasu]] (\u5408\u4f53\u30b6\u30de\u30b9 ''Gattai Zamasu''), known as Fusion Zamasu in the anime and God Zamas in the Viz manga, born of the union between Goku Black and Zamasu from an alternate future timeline. The deity known as the {{nihongo4|Old Kai\u014dshin|\u8001\u754c\u738b\u795e|R\u014d Kai\u014dshin}} is in fact a fusion of the original East Supreme Supreme Kai from 15 generations prior (\uff11\uff15\u4ee3\u524d\u306e\u6771\u306e\u754c\u738b\u795e ''J\u016bgo-Dai mae no Higashi no Supreme Kai'', lit. \"A God of a Boundary King of the East of 15 Generations Before\") and an old witch who stole one of his Potara earrings and put it on without being aware of the consequences.\n\nThe [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Namekians|Namekians]] demonstrate a related technique early in the ''Dragon Ball Z'' series, where one Namekian absorbs the energy, strength, memories, and intelligence or thought patterns of another through a process akin to {{Nihongo4|assimilation|\u878d\u5408|Y\u016bg\u014d}}. Each participant must willingly consent to fuse in this manner and usually the pair agrees to the stronger of the two to serve their body as the host. The agreed host places his hand over the chest of the other one and through unknown means, they merge with a blinding flash. Only the body of the host remains in the aftermath, and the non-host is assimilated and ceases to exist as a body. The current incarnation of Piccolo is a notable example, having assimilated two other Namekian individuals into his very being. Villainous characters like [[#Cell|Cell]] and [[#Majin Boo|Majin Buu]] are also capable of forcibly absorbing other characters in order to acquire greater power by taking advantage of their unique physiology.\n\n===Grandpa Gohan===\n{{Nihongo4|Grandpa Son Gohan|\u5b6b\u609f\u98ef\u3058\u3044\u3055\u3093|Son Gohan J\u012bsan}} is the adoptive grandfather of Goku, whom he found in a crashed spaceship.{{gnr|ch|197}} He teaches Goku martial arts, having originally studied under Master Roshi with Ox-King and also knows the ''Kamehameha'' technique.{{gnr|ch|12|, |106}} He warns Goku not to look at the full moon, but Goku disobeys him and  accidentally kills him while on a rampage in his giant ape form.{{gnr|ch|21|, |233}} Goku does not learn this until Vegeta turns into an ape and tells Goku about the transformations.{{gnr|ch|233}} He is brought back to life for one day by Baba Uranai in order to fight Goku and see his growth as a martial artist.{{gnr|ch|108}} In the anime only, he later appears as an assistant to {{nihongo4|Annin|\u30a2\u30f3\u30cb\u30f3}}, the ruler of the \"magical furnace\". He is voiced by [[Osamu Saka]] in the Japanese version of the original series, by [[Kinpei Azusa]] in ''Bardock: The Father of Goku'' and by [[Shigeru Chiba]] in ''Dragon Ball Kai''. In the Funimation dub of the series, he is voiced by [[Christopher Sabat]]. He is portrayed by [[Randall Duk Kim]] in the American live-action film ''[[Dragonball Evolution]]''; his voice was dubbed by [[Hiroya Ishimaru]] in the Japanese version. Grandpa Son Gohan briefly appears in the final chapter of Toriyama's 2013 manga series ''Jaco the Galactic Patrolman'', which is set before ''Dragon Ball''.<ref name=\"Jaco\"/>\n\n===Kai===\nThe {{anchor|Kai}}{{Nihongo4|Kai\u014d|\u754c\u738b}}, referred to as Lords of Worlds in Viz's English manga and the Kai in the English anime dub, are upper-level gods of the ''Dragon Ball'' multiverse.{{gnr|ch|205}} There are five at a time; one presiding over each of the four quadrants of the universe and the last, the {{nihongo4|Dai Kai\u014d|\u5927\u754c\u738b||\"Great Lord of Worlds\"}}, overseeing them all.{{gnr|ch|440}} The Kai reside in the heavens and are responsible for the lower-level deities who rule over individual planets. Later in the series it is revealed that Supreme Kai exist; they are themselves in charge of the Kai.{{gnr|ch|440}}, and that all Kai and Supreme Kai hail from the same race of beings. It is possible for an individual Kai to be promoted to the rank of the Supreme Kai after a period of training as an apprentice. For example, Zamasu was the former {{Nihongo4|North Kai\u014d|\u5317\u306e\u754c\u738b|Kita no Kai\u014d}} of Universe 10 prior to being chosen by the ruling Supreme Kai of Universe 10 as his apprentice and eventual successor.\n\nThe North Kai of Universe 7, named King Kai in the English anime dub and as the Lord of the Northern Worlds in the Viz Media localization, trains Goku after his self-sacrifice to defeat Raditz, and eventually trains Yamcha, Tien Shinhan, Chiaotzu and Piccolo. He is the only other Kai to appear in the original manga, besides a brief appearance of the {{Nihongo4|South Kai\u014d|\u5357\u306e\u754c\u738b|Minami no Kai\u014d}},{{gnr|ch|428}} and as such is usually simply referred to as {{Nihongo4|Kai\u014d-sama|\u754c\u738b\u69d8}} or Northern King Kai. King Kai trains dead fighters that were allowed to keep their bodies, if they manage to reach his small planet at the end of {{Nihongo4|Serpent Road|\u86c7\u306e\u9053|Hebi no Michi|\"Snake Way\" in the English anime dub}}.{{gnr|ch|205}} Before training any students, he forces them to appeal to his strange sense of humor and catch his pet monkey {{Nihongo4|Bubbles|\u30d0\u30d6\u30eb\u30b9}}.{{gnr|ch|210|, |211}} In the anime, they must also hit the flying cricket {{Nihongo4|Gregory|\u30b0\u30ec\u30b4\u30ea\u30fc}} with a mallet. King Kai provides Goku with martial arts training and two of his own techniques, the {{Nihongo4|''Genki-Dama''|\u5143\u6c17\u7389}} and the {{Nihongo4|''Kai\u014d-ken''|\u754c\u738b\u62f3}}, which he himself was never able to master.{{gnr|ch|212|, |227}} He continues to help Goku and his friends throughout the series, lending his planet locating and telecommunicating abilities for their use. When Goku brings a self-destructing Cell to his planet, the explosion kills King Kai and Bubbles and destroys his planet.{{gnr|ch|412|, |413}} As he is already in the afterlife, he only gains a halo, and in the anime appears to settle down on the Dai Kai's planet. He is voiced by [[J\u014dji Yanami]] in Japanese media until episode twelve of ''Dragon Ball Super'', where [[Naoki Tatsuta]] took over the role,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-09-25/naoki-tatsuta-temporarily-replaces-jouji-yanami-as-kaio-narrator-in-dragon-ball-super-anime/.93369|title=Naoki Tatsuta Temporarily Replaces Jouji Yanami as Kai\u014d/Narrator in Dragon Ball Super Anime|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2015-09-25|accessdate=2015-09-25}}</ref> [[Don Brown (voice actor)|Don Brown]] and [[Dave Ward (voice actor)|Dave Ward]] in the Ocean dub, [[Sean Schemmel]] in the Funimation dub, and [[Michael McConnohie]] in the Bang Zoom!

After the Saiyans were annexed by Frieza as a vassal state, he had no choice but to pledge allegiance to him, while at the same time retaining power over his own people as a vassal. King Vegeta is killed by Frieza when he leads a rebellion against him and boards his spaceship to retrieve his son. After his death, Frieza destroys his home planet and commits genocide of the entire Saiyan race. In ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods]]'' and in both the anime and manga versions of ''Dragon Ball Super'', King Vegeta is seen in flashbacks depicting his encounter with [[Beerus]] during the latter's visit to Planet Vegeta. In Japanese, he is voiced by [[Banj\u014d Ginga]] in episode 78 of ''Dragon Ball Z'', [[Yukimasa Kishino]] in episode 124 and [[Masaharu Sat\u014d]] in the eighth ''Dragon Ball Z'' film. [[Terry Klassen]] voices him in the Ocean dub, while [[Christopher Sabat]] voices him in the Funimation dub.\n\n===Monaka===\nMonaka (\u30e2\u30ca\u30ab) is a short and slender, humanoid red alien from planet Wagashi. He is deliveryman whom the God of Destruction Beerus recruits for the Tournament of Destroyers and is used as motivation for Goku to get stronger. At the conclusion of the storyline, he inadvertently won the tournament on behalf of Universe 7 after Universe 6's [[#Hit|Hit]] threw their fight. \n\nHe is voiced by [[Masami Kikuchi]] in the Japanese version of the series. In the Funimation English Dub, his voice is supplied by Daman Mills.\n\n===Pilaf Gang===\n{{Nihongo4|Pilaf|\u30d4\u30e9\u30d5|Pirafu}}, {{anchor|Pilaf}}Emperor Pilaf in the English anime dub, is a small impish blue creature who is the leader of the Pilaf Gang (\u30d4\u30e9\u30d5\u4e00\u5473 ''Pirafu Ichimi'') and dreams of ruling the world. Together with his two minions, [[#Mai|Mai]] and {{anchor|Shu}}{{Nihongo4|Shu|\u30b7\u30e5\u30a6|Sh\u016b}}, a humanoid dog in a ninja outfit, he seeks out the Dragon Balls to wish for world domination.

They later attempted to infiltrate Bulma's birthday party in order to claim the Dragon Balls again, with Pilaf being mistaken for a monkey while Trunks proclaim Mai to be his girlfriend. During the course of the ''Dragon Ball Super'' series the Pilaf Gang would gradually reform, much like several of Goku's past adversaries, and they even become Trunks' classmates at school.\n\nThe Pilaf Gang appear in the first episode of ''Dragon Ball GT'', where they obtain the Black Star Dragon Balls and Pilaf accidentally wish Goku to be a child again, setting in motion the events of the entire series.

She is initially depicted as a beautiful, calculating enemy of Goku and his friends who always resorts to weaponry and technology; her serious tone is a foil to the comic personalities of her colleagues. At some point in time prior to the [[#Cell|Cell Games]], Mai and her colleagues had used the Dragon Balls to wish for their youth, resulting in them being turned into children.\n\nDuring the Trunks Saga arc of ''Dragon Ball Super'', a once again adult Mai is revealed to be leader of the resistance forces on Earth  against the evil Goku Black in an alternate future timeline. This alternate future version of Mai (\u672a\u6765\u306e\u30de\u30a4 ''Mirai no Mai'') is depicted as a close friend and potential love interest of her timeline's Trunks, and works closely with him and their allies from the main timeline in an effort to defeat Goku Black and foil his so-called Zero Mortal Plan, which involve the complete annihilation of all mortal life in the multiverse. This version of Mai also appears as a major supporting character in [[Super Dragon Ball Heroes]], an original net animation based on the arcade game of the same name.

After the wish is granted the balls scatter across the planet, turn to stone and are useless for a year, meaning, during this year they can not be detected by Bulma's Dragon Radar.{{gnr|ch|1|, |20}} The Dragon Balls also become useless if Shenron is destroyed, in this case they must be recreated by their creator, or if their creator is killed.{{gnr|ch|148|, |165|, |194}} Shenron can not bestow a wish that exceeds the power of his creator, this is why Shenron couldn't destroy the Saiyans before they came to earth.{{gnr|ch|243}} Midway through the series, it is learned that the Dragon Balls are created by the extraterrestrials named Namekians, Earth's Kami being one of them.{{gnr|ch|242}} A person can only be brought back to life once, and only if that person did not die of natural causes.{{gnr|ch|218|, |321}} Earth is without Dragon Balls for a period, when Kami re-merges with Piccolo, until Dende takes over the position of God.{{gnr|ch|355|, |360|, |393}} When Dende recreates Earth's Dragon Balls, he makes them so that one can now have two wishes, but each wish is still capable of resurrecting multiple individuals at once.{{gnr|ch|394}} Shenron is voiced by [[Kenji Utsumi]] in the Japanese version of the series until his death in 2013 with the exclusion of episodes 192 and 193 in the series and the films, in which he is voiced by [[Masaharu Sat\u014d]]; he is voiced by [[Daisuke G\u014dri]] in ''Dragon Ball GT'', by [[K\u014dji Yada]] in the ''[[Dr. Slump]]'' remake and by [[Ry\u016bzabur\u014d \u014ctomo]] since episode 97 of ''Kai''. In the English versions of the series, he is voiced by [[Don Brown (voice actor)|Don Brown]] in the Ocean dub, and by [[Christopher Sabat]] in the Funimation dub.\n\nShenron's Namekian counterpart is {{Nihongo4|Porunga|\u30dd\u30eb\u30f3\u30ac||Namekian for \"God of Dreams\"}}.{{gnr|ch|292}} Porunga has a large, muscular humanoid upper body and something similar to a [[dorsal fin]] down his back and the Dragon Balls are much larger than Earth's. Unlike Shenron, he can only bring a single person back to life at a time, but he can bring that person back multiple times which Shenron can not.{{gnr|ch|292|, |327}} He can also grant three wishes instead of one, additionally the user must speak in the Namekian language.{{gnr|ch|292}} Porunga and the Namekian Dragon Balls were created by the planet's Great Elder, who kept one ball and gave each of the other six to a different elder.{{gnr|ch|252|, |260}} When the Namekian Dragon Balls are used again during the fight with Majin Buu, Porunga had been upgraded to be able to wish back multiple people at once and still grant three wishes.{{gnr|ch|513}} Porunga is voiced by [[Junpei Takiguchi]] in the Japanese version of the series with the exclusion of episode 283, in which he is voiced by Daisuke G\u014dri; he is voiced by Masaharu Sat\u014d in the video games. In ''Dragon Ball Kai'' Daisuke G\u014dri originally performed the role; after his death, Ry\u016bzabur\u014d \u014ctomo took over. He is voiced by Christopher Sabat in the Funimation dub of the series.\n\n''Dragon Ball GT'' introduces {{nihongo4|Ultimate Shenlong|\u7a76\u6975\u795e\u9f8d|Ky\u016bkyoku Shenron}}, a much larger red Shenron made by Kami when he and King Piccolo were still one entity. He is summoned when the Dark Dragon Balls, Black Star Dragon Balls in the Funimation dub, are gathered, and can grant any single wish, regardless of any restrictions placed on the other dragons. Ultimate Shenron is voiced by Kenji Utsumi in Japanese, and by Christopher Sabat in the Funimation dub. ''GT'' also introduces {{nihongo4|Black Smoke Shenlong|\u9ed2\u7159\u306e\u9f8d|Kokuen no Ry\u016b|lit. \"Black Smoke Dragon\"}}, named Black Smoke Shenron in the Funimation dub, a cigar-smoking dragon who forms from all the negative energy accumulated from the selfish wishes granted throughout the series using the Dragon Balls. Summoned from the same Earth Dragon Balls, he splits into the seven Evil Dragons and they spread out over the Earth, causing the heroes to defeat each one. [[Daisuke G\u014dri]] voices Evil Shenron in Japanese, and Christopher Sabat voices him in the Funimation dub.\n\n''Dragon Ball Super'' introduces {{nihongo|Super Shenlong|\u8d85\u795e\u9f8d|S\u016bp\u0101 Shenron}} and the Super Dragon Balls which are spread throughout Universes 6 and 7. The Super Dragon Balls were created by the Dragon God {{nihongo|Zalama|\u30b6\u30e9\u30de|Zarama}}, are the size of planets and have no restrictions on their wishes, although they only grant one and it must be spoken in the language of the gods. It is revealed that the Namekians took fragments of the Super Dragon Balls to create their own on Planet Namek. Super Shenron is voiced by Ry\u016bzabur\u014d \u014ctomo in Japanese and by Christopher Sabat in English.\n\n===Supreme Kai {{anchor|Kaioshin}}===\nThe {{Nihongo4|Kai\u014dshin|\u754c\u738b\u795e}}, referred to as Lords of Lords in Viz's English manga and the Supreme Kai in the English anime dub, are the highest-level deities in the ''Dragon Ball'' universe. Like the Kai whom they govern, all Supreme Kai hail from a race of naturally divine beings<ref name=\"SEG\">''[[Dragon Ball: Super Exciting Guide]]s'', 2009</ref> While the Kai watch over the living world, the Supreme Kai watch over both the \"Other World\" (the afterlife in the ''Dragon Ball'' series) and the living world.<ref>'Daizenshuu 7'', 1996</ref> The Supreme Kai are known for recruiting mortal beings to become their {{Nihongo4|disciples|\u754c\u738b\u795e\u306e\u5f1f\u5b50|Kaioshin no deshi}}; [[Gohan]] and [[Trunks (Dragon Ball)#Future Trunks|Trunks]] trained under their universe's Supreme Kai to prepare for threats like [[#Majin Boo|Majin Buu]] and [[#Dabra|Dabura]], and gained access to healing powers in the process. The Supreme Kai and their followers wear a pair of earrings known as the Potara (\u30dd\u30bf\u30e9), which allow two individuals to fuse into an amalgamation and permits the wearer to use a Time Ring. In ''Dragon Ball Super'', it is revealed that Gods of Destruction exist and are equal in status to the Supreme Kai. Supreme Kai act as {{nihongo|\"creation gods\"|\u5275\u9020\u795e|s\u014dz\u014dshin}}, by providing the energy for the creation of new planets and species, while the Gods of Destruction serve a contrasting purpose by destroying planets or entire civilizations when appropriate to maintain the balance of the universe they oversee.\n\n====Universe 7====\nThere were originally five Supreme Kai in the Seventh Universe, and much like the Kai, four of them ruled over each of the four quadrants of the universe and a fifth, the {{Nihongo4|Dai Kai\u014dshin|\u5927\u754c\u738b\u795e|\"Great Lord of Lords\"}}, ruled over them in turn.{{gnr|ch|445}} Prior to the events depicted in ''Dragon Ball'', all but one met their fate at the hands of [[Majin Boo|Majin Buu]]. The Dai Supreme Kai in particular was absorbed by Buu, who then takes a chubby form with an uncanny resemblance to the deity. The Dai Supreme Kai's spirit would continue to manifest within Buu, his benign influence dulling the creature's destructive nature to an extent. {{gnr|ch|445}}\n\nThe {{nihongo4|East Kai\u014dshin|\u6771\u306e\u754c\u738b\u795e|Higashi no Kai\u014dshin}}, originally the ruler of the eastern quadrant of Universe 7, became the de facto ruler of the entire universe as a result of the demise of his peers.{{gnr|ch|445|, |440}} He has purple skin and a white mohawk and is always accompanied by his larger, reddish-pink skinned, loyal attendant {{nihongo4|Kibito|\u30ad\u30d3\u30c8}}. In the ''Dragon Ball'' manga he came to Earth, under the alias {{nihongo4|\"Shin\"|\u30b7\u30f3}}, to meet Goku and his friends and recruit them to stop Babidi from reviving Buu.{{gnr|ch|438|, |446|, |460}} After failing to prevent to Buu's return, Gohan is then taken to the Supreme Kai's faraway planet (\u754c\u738b\u795e\u754c Supreme Kaikai, lit. \"Realm of the Lord of Lords\") where he is given the {{nihongo4|Zeta Sword|\u30bc\u30c3\u30c8\u30bd\u30fc\u30c9|Zetto S\u014ddo}} (\"Z Sword\" in the English anime dub) and put to training. The sword is accidentally broken during Gohan's training, releasing an ancestor of the East Supreme Kai. He uses his power to increase Gohan's and his own life force to resurrect Goku, who made the decision to remain in the afterlife after his death by a self-destructing [[Cell (Dragon Ball)|Cell]]. The elder Supreme Kai, referred to as the {{nihongo4|Old Kai\u014dshin|\u8001\u754c\u738b\u795e|R\u014d Kai\u014dshin}}, remains by his descendant's side as an advisor following Majin Buu's defeat, and makes recurring appearances in subsequent ''Dragon Ball'' media.{{gnr|ch|471|, |479}}\n\nKibito and the East Supreme Kai later gets permanently fused into one being, known as {{nihongo4|Kibitoshin|\u30ad\u30d3\u30c8\u795e}} in the manga and as Kibito Kai in the anime, via their use of Potara earrings.{{gnr|ch|501}} Kibito Kai later assists in the final battle with Buu by teleporting Goku and the last survivors on Earth onto his planet and helps take Dende to New Namek to use its Dragon Balls to revive Earth and its people.{{gnr|ch|508|, |513}} In ''Dragon Ball Super'', Kibito Kai uses a wish granted by the Namekian Dragon Balls to defuse himself back into the two original component entities.\n\nThe East Supreme Kai is voiced by [[Y\u016bji Mitsuya]],<ref name=\"new voices\"/> and by Shinichir\u014d \u014cta in ''Dragon Ball Super'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods|Battle of Gods]]''. In English the Supreme Kai is voiced by [[Kent Williams (voice actor)|Kent Williams]] in Funimation's English dub, and by Michael Dobson in the Ocean Group dub.\n\nKibito is voiced by Shin Aomori, by Don Brown in the Ocean Group dub and by Chuck Huber in the Funimation dub.\n\nThe Elder Kai is voiced by Reiz\u014d Nomoto in ''Dragon Ball Z'' and ''Dragon Ball GT'', and by Ry\u014dichi Tanaka in ''Dragon Ball Super'' and ''Battle of Gods''. Tetsuya Iwanaga provides the voice for the Elder Kai's younger self in flashbacks. In English he is voiced by [[Scott McNeil]] in the Ocean dub, by Steve Olson in the Blue Water dub, and by Kent Williams in the Funimation dubs.\n\n====Universe 10====\nGowasu (\u30b4\u30ef\u30b9), known as Gowas in the manga, is the ruling Supreme Kai of Universe 10. At some point in time in the past, Gowasu chose Zamasu, the North Kai of Universe 10, to be his successor based on his battle talent, a decision he would later regret as he chose an apprentice without noticing the potential for evil within him. Unlike many of his peers from the other Universes, he does not resent Goku or view him as being disrespectful, as he is the only deity outside of Universe 6 and Universe 7 who actually knows him on a personal level. Gowasu, along with his counterpart from Universe 7, traveled to an alternate future world where Zamasu has ravaged the world to assist Goku and his associates in dealing with his former apprentice. During the Tournament of Power arc, Gowasu is shown recruiting team members to fight on behalf of Universe 10, as well as recording and uploading their exploits on a channel known as \"GodTube\".\n\nIn an alternate future timeline, Zamasu succeeds Gowasu as the ruling Supreme Kai of Universe 10 after he successfully assassinates the latter.\n\nGowasu is voiced by Tetsuo Goto in the Japanese version and by Garrett Schenck in the Funimation dub.\n\n===Zeno {{anchor|Zen.C5.8D}}===\nGrand Zeno ({{Nihongo|Zen\u014d|\u5168\u738b}}, lit. \"King of All\"), also known as the Omni-King and as the Lord of Everything in Viz's English manga, is the supreme deity of the whole ''Dragon Ball'' multiverse. Depicted as a childlike humanoid figure, Zeno ranks above all other mortals and gods in the series and has the power to erase entire universes from existence at will. He is served by a pair of identical-looking attendants and is advised by Grand Minister. First appearing during the aftermath of the Tournament of Destroyers between Universes 6 and 7, Zeno is treated with utmost reverence and fear by the other gods and mortals. He is addressed by his subjects as {{Nihongo|Zen\u014d-sama|\u5168\u738b\u69d8}} in original Japanese media, and Grand Zeno or the Omni-King in the English dub. Goku is a notable exception; he befriends and addresses Zeno in a casual manner (\"Zen-chan\" (\u5168\u3061\u3083\u3093) in the original Japanese, \"Zenny\" in the English dub), which is considered disrespectful and lacking in etiquette by most characters in the series. Part of the caution others have around Zeno comes from the fact that he acts and behaves like a child, destroying entire planets and universes out of amusement or dismay. Since the ''[[List_of_Dragon_Ball_Super_episodes#\"Future\"_Trunks_Saga_(2016\u20132017)|\"Future\" Trunks Saga]]'', there are two coequal Zenos. Zeno is voiced by [[Satomi K\u014drogi]] in Japanese and by Sarah Wiedenheft in English.\n\n====Grand Minister====\nThe {{nihongo4|Grand Minister|\u5927\u795e\u5b98|daishinkan}}, also known as the Grand Priest in Viz's English manga is an angelic being who serves as a close adviser and guiding figure to Zeno. He is the father of all twelve Angels in the multiverse. The Grand Minister's principal tasks are to implement Zeno's decrees and welcome guests to his palace. During the Zeno Expo and the Tournament of Power, the Grand Minister served as the referee.\n\nThe character is voiced by Masaya Takatsuka in the Japanese version and by [[Josh Grelle]] in the Funimation dub.\n\n===Universe 6 inhabitants===\n{{Nihongo4|Universe 6|\u7b2c\uff16\u5b87\u5b99|''Dai roku Uch\u016b''}}, also known as the Challenging Universe (\u6311\u6226\u306e\u5b87\u5b99 ''Ch\u014dsen no Uch\u016b''), is the sixth of the twelve parallel universes introduced in ''Dragon Ball Super''; the God of Destruction is [[#Champa|Champa]], the Supreme Kai is {{nihongo|Fuwa|\u30d5\u30ef}}, and the Angel is [[#Vados|Vados]]. Universe 6 is linked with Universe 7 as twin universes, and that any planets or species that have existed and/or exist in Universe 7 will exist or are likely have existed in Universe 6, and vice versa. For example, the Saiyan people also exist in Universe 6, but their fates are completely different compared to their Universe 7 counterparts; they live relatively peaceful lives on their homeworld {{Nihongo4|Sadala|\u30b5\u30c0\u30e9|Sadara}}, and were never enslaved or wiped out by their enemies. Instead of conquering other planets, the Saiyans of Universe 6 tamed their desire to battle for good, and use their skills to protect the civilizations of their universe from danger and unrest.\n\nCharacters from this universe were the first outside of Universe 7 to be introduced upon the reveal of there being multiple other universes.\n\n====Auta Magetta====\n{{nihongo|Auta Magetta|\u30aa\u30c3\u30bf \u30de\u30b2\u30c3\u30bf|Otta Magetta}} is a Metalman from Universe 6.\n\nIn the Tournament of Destroyers, Auta Magetta competed in a tournament against Universe 7. He fought Vegeta where his lava-spewing abilities started to heat up the ring. After breaking the barrier, Vegeta recovered from the overheating and knocked Auta Megetta out of the ring.\n\nIn the Tournament of Power, Auta Magetta assisted Frost in attacking Vegeta and Master Roshi. Vegeta managed to knock him out of the ring after insulting him.\n\nAuta Magetta is voiced by Naoki Tatsuta in the Japanese version.\n\n====Botamo====\n{{nihongo|Botamo|\u30dc\u30bf\u30e2|Botamo}} is a tall yellow humanoid bear from Universe 6 with rubber skin that can withstand any punch.\n\nIn the Tournament of Destroyers, he faced off against Goku in the tournament against Universe 7. Goku had a hard time landing a blow on Botamo until he grabbed him by the arm and threw him out of the ring.\n\nIn the Tournament of Power, Botamo faced off against Gohan. The punches from Gohan started to lift Botamo off the ground until it was enough for Gohan to use the Kamehameha to blast Botamo out of the ring.\n\nBotamo is voiced by Yasuhiro Takato in the Japanese version and by Cris George in the Funimation dub.\n\n====Cabba====\n{{Nihongo4|Cabba|\u30ad\u30e3\u30d9|''Kyabe''}} is a Saiyan hailing from Planet Sadala and an elite member of the Sadala Defense Forces, first introduced in ''Dragon Ball Super''. Planet Sadala is also the original homeworld of the Saiyans of Universe 7, but according to [[Vegeta]], it has been destroyed by internal discord long ago and no longer exists. Unlike the arrogant and savage nature exhibited by the vast majority of Saiyans from Universe 7, Cabba is presented as a good-natured and humble individual who speaks respectfully to everyone and sees himself as a protector of the weak. As one of Universe 6's strongest warriors, he is recruited to join Champa's team during [[List of Dragon Ball Super episodes#Season 3: Universe 6 Saga|the Tournament of Destroyers]]. Cabba bonds with Vegeta following the events of the tournament and looks up to him as a mentor, in spite of the fact that they fight for opposing teams.\n\nHe is voiced by [[Daisuke Kishio]] in the Japanese version of the series. In the Funimation English Dub, his voice is supplied by [[Clifford Chapin]].\n\n====Champa====\n{{Nihongo4|Champa|\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3\u30d1|Shanpa}} is [[Beerus]]' twin brother and the God of Destruction of Universe 6, which is linked with the Seventh Universe as its \"twin universe\". He looks like an overweight version of Beerus and wears a variation of the traditional Egyptian clothing and ornaments Beerus is wearing and his name also derives from an alcoholic drink, {{Nihongo4|[[Champagne]]|\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3\u30d1\u30f3|Shanpan}}. He has a long-running rivalry with Beerus, and the brothers often bicker or engage in acts of [[one-upmanship]] like food contests and [[proxy war]]s. During the [[List of Dragon Ball Super episodes#Season 3: Universe 6 Saga|Universe 6 Saga]], Champa holds a fighting tournament known as the Tournament of Destroyers; he forms a team by gathering the strongest warriors from Universe 6 to challenge Universe 7, which consists of [[#Hit|Hit]], [[#Cabba|Cabba]], [[#Frost|Frost]], [[#Botamo|Botamo]], and [[#Auta Magetta|Auta Magetta]].\n\nChampa is voiced by [[Mitsuo Iwata]] in the Japanese version of the series. In the Funimation bub, his voice is supplied by [[Jason Liebrecht]].\n\n====Caulifla====\n{{Nihongo4|Caulifla|\u30ab\u30ea\u30d5\u30e9|''Karifura''}} is a Saiyan from Universe 6 and a member of Team Universe 6 who participates in the Tournament of Power. Brash and headstrong, she is the leader of a group of Saiyan punks. She shows a strong contrast to the rest of her people, acting more akin to the Universe 7 Saiyans who are known for being naturally aggressive and prideful. She also displays a love for getting stronger, which is evident after she heard from her Universe 7 counterparts about various advanced, more powerful forms a Saiyan could attain.\n\nCaulifla is voiced by Yuka Komatsu in the Japanese version and by [[Elizabeth Maxwell]] in the Funimation dub.\n\n====Frost====\n{{Nihongo4|Frost|\u30d5\u30ed\u30b9\u30c8|''Furosuto''}} is the ruler of an empire based in Universe 6, and hails from the same race of beings as Universe 7's [[Freeza|Frieza]]. He is first introduced in ''Dragon Ball Super'' as a competitor for his universe during the Tournament of Destroyers. Unlike Frieza, he is apparently perceived in a positive light by the majority of his subjects in Universe 6. Frost's characterization differs between the manga and anime adaptions of ''Dragon Ball Super'', being a malevolent being not unlike Frieza in the anime, while on the other hand the manga version of the character is simply amoral and unsportsmanlike. In the anime, Frost faces off against Goku, Piccolo and Vegeta in successive rounds in the tournament and defeats Goku and Piccolo by cheating and using his secret poison; Goku is allowed to return to the tournament after this is revealed and Frost is defeated by Vegeta. He is eventually exposed as a devious manipulator who feigns benevolence as a facade, and is in fact a space pirate and planet broker who discreetly profits from warmongering activities in his universe.\n\nIn the Tournament of Power, Frost meets Frieza before the tournament begins. He accompanied Auta Magetta in fighting Vegeta and Master Roshi. After a failed attempt to use the Evil Containment Wave on Vegeta, Frost fled. Then he met up with Frieza where they fought Gohan. Frieza then double-crosses Frost and blasts him out of the ring. When Frost tries to attack Frieza for double-crossing him, both Zenos erase Frost for violating the rules. This served as a warning to Champa to not let something like this happen again or else their entire universe will be erased. Frost is later restored when Android 17 uses the Super Dragon Balls to restore the erased universes.\n\nIn the manga, there is no mention of Frost being involved in criminal activities nor any indication of him being evil, and he appears to have a genuinely pleasant personality. He is indifferent to accusations of being a dirty fighter for using his poisonous stingers, as the tournament offers no prize money and the battles are ultimately pointless according to his perspective.\n\nFrost is voiced by [[Ry\u016bsei Nakao]] in the Japanese version of the series. In the Funimation English Dub, his voice is supplied by [[Greg Ayres]].\n\n====Hit====\n{{nihongo4|Hit|\u30d2\u30c3\u30c8|''Hitto''}}, also known as {{nihongo4|Hit the Infallible|\u767e\u767a\u767e\u4e2d\u306e\u30d2\u30c3\u30c8|Hyappatsuhyakuchuu no Hitto}} and as the {{nihongo4|Legendary Assassin|\u4f1d\u8aac\u306e\u6bba\u3057\u5c4b|Densetsu no Koroshi-ya}}, is an assassin from Universe 6 introduced in ''Dragon Ball Super''. He is known for using his signature {{nihongo|''Time-Skip''|\u6642\u3068\u3070\u3057|Toki-Tobashi}} ability to manipulate time and for his capability to eliminate his assassination targets with a single strike. Over a millennium old, he is the strongest member of his universe's team during [[List of Dragon Ball Super episodes#Season 3: Universe 6 Saga|the Tournament of Destroyers]]. Hit eventually rebels against [[#Champa|Champa]] and throws his fight against Monaka (\u30e2\u30ca\u30ab), easily the weakest participating member of the opposing Universe 7 team, by eliminating himself in the final match of the tournament.\n\nIn Japanese, Hit is voiced by [[Kazuhiro Yamaji]]. In the English dub, he is voiced [[Aaron Roberts]] in ''[[Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2]]'' and by [[Matthew Mercer]] in all subsequent appearances.\n\n====Kale====\n{{nihongo4|Kale|\u30b1\u30fc\u30eb|K\u0113ru}} is a Saiyan from Universe 6 and a member of Team Universe 6 who participates in the Tournament of Power. Kale is Caulifla's best friend, sister-figure, and prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Unlike most Saiyans who are assertive or at least strong-willed, Kale is by nature a very meek and timid individual. Her greatest desire is to fight alongside Caulifla as equals; her devotion to Caulifla have also become a strong trigger for her in battle. Much like [[Broly]] from Universe 7, she is the latest Legendary Saiyan of her universe, a demonic warrior who appears once every 1000 years. When accessing her Super Saiyan powers, Kale's personality becomes a polar opposite; shifting through emotions while in her berserker state, she would become excessively violent and savage, showing no mercy to anyone who stands in her way.\n\nKale is voiced by Yukana in the Japanese version and by Dawn M. Bennett in the English dub.\n\n====Vados====\n{{nihongo4|Vados|\u30f4\u30a1\u30c9\u30b9|Vadosu}}, the sister of [[#Whis|Whis]], is an Angel from Universe 6 who is the attendant and martial arts teacher of [[#Champa|Champa]]. Like Whis, her name is also derived from an alcoholic drink, {{nihongo4|[[calvados]]|\u30ab\u30eb\u30f4\u30a1\u30c9\u30b9|karuvadosu}}. In ''Dragon Ball Super'', she is first seen accompanying Champa while searching for the Super Dragon Balls; they are successful in obtaining six of the seven Super Dragon Balls prior to [[List of Dragon Ball Super episodes#Season 3: Universe 6 Saga|the Tournament of Destroyers]]. Vados openly displays concern with Champa's physique and health problems and often teases him for being overweight, blaming his weight issues as the cause of his low stamina and his difficulty in keeping up with her training. She is also shown to be polite and respectful, even when addressing lesser beings or those who are not from her universe such as Goku.\n\nVados is voiced by [[Yuriko Yamaguchi (voice actor)|Yuriko Yamaguchi]] in the Japanese version. In the English version, Vados is voiced by [[Caitlin Glass]] in the Funimation English dub and by [[Wendee Lee]] in the Bang Zoom! dub.\n\n===Universe 11 inhabitants===\n{{nihongo|Universe 11|\u7b2c\uff11\uff11\u5b87\u5b99|Dai j\u016bichi Uch\u016b}}, also known as the Justice Universe (\u6b63\u7fa9\u306e\u5b87\u5b99 ''S\u0113gi no Uch\u016b''), is the eleventh of the twelve parallel universes introduced in ''Dragon Ball Super''; the God of Destruction is Vermoud (known as Belmod in the anime), the Supreme Kai is {{nihongo|Khai|\u30ab\u30a4|Cae}}, and the Angel is {{nihongo4|Marcarita|\u30de\u30eb\u30ab\u30ea\u30fc\u30bf|Marukar\u012bta}}. Universe 11 is linked with Universe 2 as twin universes. The Pride Troopers (\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9\u30c8\u30eb\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30ba '' Puraido Tor\u016bp\u0101su'') are a very powerful superhero team who operate in this universe; they work under their God of Destruction, and the most elite Pride Troopers made up the entirety of Team Universe 11 participating in the Tournament of Power.\n\n====Belmod====\n{{Nihongo4|Belmod|\u30d9\u30eb\u30e2\u30c3\u30c9|Berumoddo}}, known as known as \"Vermoud\" in the Viz Media localization, is a scrawny humanoid in [[clown]] makeup and the God of Destruction of Universe 11. He dislikes evil and praises the work of the Pride Troopers. Top is his candidate for God of Destruction when Belmod retires. He is usually accompanied by his attendant and martial arts teacher Marcarita.\n\nBelmod is voiced by Masami Kikuchi in the Japanese version and by Markus Lloyd in the Funimation dub.\n\n====Dyspo====\n{{nihongo|Dyspo|\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30dd|Disupo}} is the [[Sphynx cat]]-like blitz captain of the Pride Troopers. In the Tournament of Power, he used his own super-speed when fighting Hit before retreating. During his fight with Frieza, Dyspo also fought against Gohan who sacrificed himself to get Dyspo out of the ring.\n\nDyspo is voiced by Bin Shimada in the Japanese version and by Christopher Dontrell Piper in the Funimation dub.\n\n====Jiren====\n{{nihongo|Jiren|\u30b8\u30ec\u30f3}}, also referred to as {{nihongo|\"Jiren The Gray\"|\u7070\u8272\u306e\u30b8\u30ec\u30f3|Haiiro no Jiren}}, is a [[gray alien]]-styled member of the Pride Troopers who served as a major contestant in the Tournament of Power. His quiet, stoic demeanor is but a glimpse of his solitary nature; he is haunted by his past losses and desperately tries to undo it all by forging his own path of justice. While fighting for justice, he has no loyalty to anyone beyond himself, believing that trusting in others will ultimately backfire. Jiren is very proud of his strength and refuses to accept the help of his comrades even in dire moments where he is under severe pressured from his opponents.\n\nJiren is voiced by Eiji Hanawa in the Japanese version and by [[Patrick Seitz]] in the Funimation dub.\n\n====Toppo====\n{{nihongo|Toppo|\u30c8\u30c3\u30dd}}, known as Top in the anime, is the tall and burly leader of the Pride Troopers, who act as guardians of peace within Universe 11 and formed the majority of participants representing Universe 11 in the Tournament of Power. A hot-blooded yet humble fighter who passionately believes in the concept of justice, Toppo is a candidate to become Universe 11's next God of Destruction, being the second most powerful mortal within his home universe after his comrade Jiren. His commitment to pursuing justice is further seen from his tendency to name his techniques as an extension of justice, such as the Justice Flash.\n\nTop is voiced by Kenji Nomura in the Japanese version and by Ray Hurd in the Funimation dub.\n\n==Anime-exclusive characters==\nThe manga's [[anime]] and film adaptations feature some original characters not created by Toriyama but by [[Toei Animation]] staff; the vast majority of the film adaptations in particular exist in their own unique continuities which branch off from the anime television series at various points, hence original characters introduced in the films are usually unknown to the characters in either or both of the official anime and manga series continuities.<ref>{{cite web |first= Richard|last= Eisenbeis|title=Dragon Ball Super: Broly|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/dragon-ball-super/broly/.140937|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=18 December 2018|accessdate= February 7, 2019}}</ref> Toriyama personally designed certain characters which made their debut appearances in the [[List of Dragon Ball films|animated films]],<ref name=\"Movies\">{{cite book |title=Dragon Ball \u5927\u5168\u96c6 6 Movies & TV Specials|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|pages=212\u2013216|year=1995|isbn=4-08-782756-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Dragon Ball \u30d5\u30eb\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc \u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30b6\u7de8 4|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|pages=240\u2013245|year=2013|isbn=978-4-08-870715-0}}</ref><ref>[http://www.kanzenshuu.com/production/toriyama/ Production Guide | Toriyama's Contributions to the Anime<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> such as [[Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug|Slug]], [[Dragon Ball Z: Cooler's Revenge#Cooler|Cooler]], [[Dragon Ball Z: Super Android 13!|Android 13]], [[Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 The Legendary Super Saiyan#Broly|Broly]], [[Dragon Ball Z: Bojack Unbound#Bojack|Bojack]], and [[Dragon Ball Z: Wrath of the Dragon#Tapion|Tapion]]. \n\n===Garlic Jr.===\n{{Nihongo4|Garlic Jr.|\u30ac\u30fc\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30b8\u30e5\u30cb\u30a2|G\u0101rikku Junia}} is a character that first appears in ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Dead Zone]]''.

Despite transforming into his final form, which is one transformation higher than his brother, he is defeated by Super Saiyan Goku. He returns in the sixth film, his remains having combined with the {{nihongo4|Big Gete Star|\u30d3\u30c3\u30b0\u30b2\u30c6\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc|Biggu Gete Sut\u0101}}, a sentient planet-sized machine.

Originally known as T2006 or DB4649T2006RS, Giru is a Machine Mutant, fully mechanical beings with organic properties: they can mold, contort, and reshape themselves like organic lifeforms, absorb and integrate metallic and mechanical materials into their own being, as well as restructuring themselves. He is encountered by Goku, Pan and Trunks on Imecka. Giru consumes their Dragon Radar for energy in an act of desperation for survival, inadvertably integrating the Dragon Radar's functionality into his software. Giru joins Goku's group and accompanies them to various planets in the galaxy on their quest to find the Black Star Dragon Balls. Giru would become good friends with Pan in the series; however, he is frequently the recipient of abuse, both verbal and physical, at the hands of Pan, which makes him somewhat fearful of her. Giru plays a pivotal role during the group's encounter with his creator [[#Doctor Myuu|Doctor Myuu]] as well as the parasitic [[#Baby|Baby]] on the planet M-2, and aids them in their subsequent struggle against the villains. During the Shadow Dragons arc, Giru accompanies Goku and Pan to search for the seven Shadow Dragons using his built-in Dragon Radar functionality to track the creatures. He is voiced by [[Shinobu Satouchi]] in Japanese media and by [[Sonny Strait]] in the Funimation anime dub.\n\n====Doctor Myuu====\n{{Nihongo4|Doctor Myuu|\u30c9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30df\u30e5\u30fc|Dokut\u0101 My\u016b}}  is a recurring antagonistic character that first appears in the 13th episode of ''Dragon Ball GT''.

His plans are eventually foiled by Goku, Pan and Trunks after they arrive on the planet M-2 and defeat most of his minions. Myuu escapes and evades Goku and his companions after Baby's apparent defeat, only to be killed when Baby suddenly emerges from his body. It is then revealed that Baby was the one who created and programmed Dr. Myuu, and not the other way around. He later joins forces with [[#Doctor Gero|Doctor Gero]] while in Hell to create a duplicate of [[Android 17]] using Myuu's machine mutant technology, who then manipulates the original Android 17 into converging their power together to open a rift between Earth and Hell, enabling him and his co-creators to escape. Android 17 and his machine mutant duplicate eventually fuse together to become Super 17, who subsequently turns on and murders both Gero and Myuu. He is voiced by [[Kazuyuki Sogabe]] in Japanese media and [[Duncan Brannan]] in the Funimation anime dub.\n\n====Baby====\n{{Nihongo4|Baby|\u30d9\u30d3\u30fc|Beb\u012b}} is a character that first appears in the 22nd episode of ''Dragon Ball GT''.

Baby desires to exterminate all of the Saiyans to avenge the extinction of his people and the loss of their homeworld to the Saiyans. Baby is first reactivated from a sleep state by [[#Doctor Myuu|Doctor Myuu]]; he attempts to fight Goku, Trunks, and Pan, but is easily defeated. To Buust his power, Baby infects various people with his DNA and begins gathering energy from them. After a second defeat at the hands of the three Saiyans, Baby infects Trunks and travels to Earth with his unsuspecting host. On Earth he battles Goten and Gohan, infects them both, and is able to infect Vegeta and make him his primary host. Goku, Trunks, and Pan return to Earth to find the entire population is now under Baby's control. Baby is able to defeat Goku, then he begins using the Black Star Dragon Balls to restore the planet Tuffle and transport the Earth population to it. During this time, Baby evolves into an even more powerful form and defeats Goku again. This causes Goku to transform into a Golden Great Ape and then into a Super Saiyan 4. In this new form, Goku is able to defeat \"Baby-Vegeta\". He has Bulma, also under his control, fire a radiation beam at him from her Blutz Wave Generator which enables him to transform into a Golden Great Ape as well. After a lengthy battle, Baby separates from Vegeta and attempts to escape in a spaceship, vowing to return to destroy the Saiyans. Goku blasts the spaceship with a ''10x Kamehameha'' attack, sending it into the sun. The ship is destroyed and Baby is obliterated.

When attempting to undo the damage caused by Super 17, the cigar-smoking Black Smoke Shenron, [[#Shenron|Evil Shenron]] in Japanese, is summoned from the Dragon Balls instead of the regular Shenron. He splits out the tainted Dragon Balls before fading away, each manifesting into one of the seven dragons as they proceed to cause chaos across the world. They are named after the One-Star through Seven-Star Dragon Balls; {{nihongo4|One-Star Dragon|\u4e00\u661f\u9f8d|\u012ashinron|Chinese: Y\u012b X\u012bng L\u00f3ng}}, {{nihongo4|Two-Star Dragon|\u4e8c\u661f\u9f8d|Ryanshinron|Chinese: \u00c8r X\u012bng L\u00f3ng}}, {{nihongo4|Three-Star Dragon|\u4e09\u661f\u9f8d|Sanshinron|Chinese: S\u0101n X\u012bng L\u00f3ng}}, {{nihongo4|Four-Star Dragon|\u56db\u661f\u9f8d|S\u016bshinron|Chinese: S\u00ec X\u012bng L\u00f3ng}}, {{nihongo4|Five-Star Dragon|\u4e94\u661f\u9f8d|\u016ashinron|Chinese: W\u01d4 X\u012bng L\u00f3ng}}, {{nihongo4|Six-Star Dragon|\u516d\u661f\u9f8d|Ry\u016bshinron|Chinese: Li\u00f9 X\u012bng L\u00f3ng}}, and {{nihongo4|Seven-Star Dragon|\u4e03\u661f\u9f8d|Ch\u012bshinron|Chinese: Q\u012b X\u012bng L\u00f3ng}}. In the English dubs their names are changed to Syn Shenron, Haze Shenron, Eis Shenron, Nuova Shenron, Rage Shenron, Oceanus Shenron, and Naturon Shenron respectively. Goku, Pan and Giru manage to defeat the other dragons before encountering Eis and Nuova Shenron. Being much more honorable than his siblings, Nuova helps Goku defeat Eis. However, Syn Shenron kills Nuova before absorbing both his Dragon Ball and the others as well to increase his power.\n\nSyn Sheron, or the One-Star Dragon, was created as the result of Mr. Popo's wish with Earth's Dragon balls to revive everyone on Namek that died at the hands of Frieza and his forces. The nature of the wish in turn made Syn Sheron both the most powerful and most evil of the Shadow Dragons. Making himself known after the death of Eis Shenron, killing Nuova Shenron in the process, Syn Shenron manages to swallow the other six Dragon Balls to become Omega Sheron, {{nihongo4|Super One-Star Dragon|\u8d85\u4e00\u661f\u9f8d|S\u016bp\u0101 \u012ashinron}} in Japanese, with access to all of the abilities of his Shadow Dragon brethren.

Located in the northeastern Caribbean Sea, Puerto Rico was key to the Spanish Empire since the early years of exploration, conquest and colonization of the New World.\n\n[[File:Puerto Rico geography.gif|thumb|left|250px|Geography of Puerto Rico]]\nThe [[topography]] of the main island is divided into three major regions: the mountainous region, which includes the ''[[Cordillera Central (Puerto Rico)|Cordillera Central]]'', ''[[Sierra de Luquillo]]'', ''Sierra de Cayey'' and ''Sierra Bermeja'', the coastal plains and the northern [[Karst topography|karst]] region. The ''Cordillera Central'' extends through the entire island, dividing it into the northern and southern region. The mountain region accounts for approximately 60% <!--check this fact--> of the land area.\n\nThe archipelago of [[Culebra, Puerto Rico|Culebra]], located east of Puerto Rico, north of [[Vieques]], and west of the Virgin Islands, is composed of the main island of Culebra and 28 uninhabited islets.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.lat-long.com/Lookup.cfm?Name=&State=PR&County=Culebra&FeatureType=island&Submit=Lat-Long+Search|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160303170910/http://www.lat-long.com/Lookup.cfm?Name=&State=PR&County=Culebra&FeatureType=island&Submit=Lat-Long+Search|url-status= dead|archive-date= 2016-03-03|title=ISLAND, county CULEBRA, state PR| accessdate = 2006-07-13|publisher=Lat-Long.com }}</ref> Mainly mountainous, the island of Culebra possesses renowned beaches.\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main article|Climate of Puerto Rico}}\nLocated in the [[tropics]], Puerto Rico enjoys an average temperature of {{convert|81|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|sigfig=2}} throughout the year. The seasons do not change very drastically. The temperature in the south is usually a few degrees higher than the north and temperatures in the central interior mountains are always cooler than the rest of the island. The highest temperature record was in the Town of [[San German]] with {{convert|105|\u00b0F|sigfig=3}} and the minimum registration is {{convert|39|\u00b0F|sigfig=2}} in [[Aibonito]].

Most of these rivers are born in the ''Cordillera Central'', Puerto Rico's principal mountain range located across the center of the island. The rivers in the north of the island are bigger and with higher flow capacity than those of the south. The south is thus drier and hotter than the north. These rivers make up 60 [[Drainage basin|watersheds throughout the island]], where over 95% of the runoff goes back to sea.\n\n===Flora and fauna===\n{{Main article|Fauna of Puerto Rico|List of endemic flora of Puerto Rico}}\n[[File:Puerto Rico ecosystems map-en.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|left|Map of the ecosystems of Puerto Rico]]\nAs of 1998,<ref>[http://islands.unep.ch/ISV.htm#459 Island Directory].</ref> 239 [[plant]]s, 16 [[bird]]s and 39 [[amphibian]]s/[[reptile]]s have been discovered that are [[Endemism|endemic]] to the archipelago of Puerto Rico. The majority of these (234, 12 and 33 respectively) are found on the main island. The most recognizable endemic species and a symbol of Puerto Rican pride are the [[Coqu\u00ed]]s (''Eleutherodactylus'' spp.), small frogs easily recognized by the sound from which they get their name. [[El Yunque National Forest]], a [[Puerto Rican moist forests|tropical rainforest]], is home to the majority (13 of 16) of species of Coqu\u00ed. It is also home to more than 240 plants, 26 of which are endemic, and 50 bird species, including the [[critically endangered]] [[Puerto Rican amazon]] (''Amazona vittata'').\n\n===Forests===\n[[File:Puerto rico osm-cycle.JPG|thumb|Greenery of Puerto Rico as seen in an OpenStreetMap map of Puerto Rico]]\nForests of Puerto Rico are well represented by the flora of the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF), a [[Long Term Ecological Research Network]] site managed by the [[United States Forest Service]] and [[University of Puerto Rico]]. At this site, there are four main life zones, delineated on the basis of temperature and precipitation (Holdridge System), in the Luquillo Mountains: subtropical wet and subtropical rain forests are found at low and mid elevations, lower montane rain and lower montane wet forests at high elevations. There is also an area of subtropical moist forest at low elevations on the southwest slope.\n\nTabonuco forest, so named for the dominant tabonuco tree (''[[Dacryodes excelsa]]''), covers lower slopes to about {{convert|2000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. In well-developed stands the larger trees exceed {{convert|98|ft|m|abbr=on}} in height, there is a fairly continuous [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] at {{convert|66|ft|m|abbr=on}}, and the shaded [[understory]] is moderately dense. Tabonuco trees are especially large on ridges, where they are firmly rooted in the rocky substrate and connected by root grafts with each other. There are about 168 tree species in the tabonuco forest.\n\nThe Colorado forest, named for the large Colorado tree (''[[Cyrilla|Cyrilla racemiflora]]''), begins above the tabonuco forest and extends up to about {{convert|3000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Its canopy reaches only about {{convert|49|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Soils are saturated and root mats above the soil are common. There are some 53 tree species in this forest type. At this same elevation, but in especially steep and wet areas, is palm forest, heavily dominated by the sierra palm (''[[Prestoea montana]]''). Patches of palm forest are also found in saturated [[Riparian zone|riparian areas]] in the tabonuco forest. The palm forest reaches about 15 m in height.\n\nAt the highest elevations is [[Elfin forest|dwarf forest]], a dense forest as short as {{convert|9.8|ft|m|abbr=on}}, on saturated soils. Here the trees are covered with [[Epiphyte|epiphytic]] [[moss]]es and vascular plants, especially [[bromeliad]]s, and these also cover large areas of the ground. Ascending the Luquillo Mountains through these forest types, the average tree height and diameter, number of tree species, and basal area (cross sectional area of tree stems) tend to decrease, while stem density increases.\n\nThere are more than 89 tree species in the LEF. The most common are ''Prestoea acuminata'', ''[[Casearia arborea]]'', ''Dacryodes excelsa'', ''[[Manilkara bidentata]]'', ''[[Inga laurina]]'', and ''[[Sloanea berteroana]]''. Common shrub species are ''[[Palicourea croceoides]]'', ''[[Psychotria berteriana]]'', and ''[[Piper glabrescens]]''. [[Grass]]es, [[fern]]s, and [[forb]]s are frequent on the ground, especially in canopy gaps; epiphytes are fairly common, and vines are uncommon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lternet.edu/sites/luq/fulldescription.php?site=LUQ |title=Luquillo LTER \u2013 LUQ Description |publisher=Long Term Ecological Research Network |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527174310/http://www.lternet.edu/sites/luq/fulldescription.php?site=LUQ |archivedate=2010-05-27 }}</ref>\n\n[[Puerto Rican dry forests]] are dominated by plants in the families [[Rubiaceae]], [[Euphorbiaceae]], and [[Myrtaceae]].

Fernandez is currently developing cutting edge forestry methods known as the \"Borincano Model\". The model capitalizes on the diversity of ecological niches in Puerto Rican forests and native disturbance regimes to formulate practices uniquely suited to the forests of the territory. About his model Fernandez has been known to comment, \"Soy de aqu\u00ed como el coqu\u00ed\" I am from here just like the Coqu\u00ed, a common patriotic axiom that is used to demonstrate their native ties to the island. Although incorrect, many believe that the Coqu\u00ed and its unique vocalizations are indigenous to the island of Puerto Rico. In fact however, there are thriving populations of Coqu\u00eds that, like the people of Puerto Rico, have been transported to the island of Hawaii. The Coqu\u00ed is viewed as an ecological menace in Hawaii where its song of ''co kee co kee'' is found to be an irritant by many. Needless to say that efforts to eradicate its presence in Hawaii is not a popular issue among Puerto Ricans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-coqui-frog-hawaii-20141228-story.html|title=Tiny coqui frog becomes a big problem in Hawaii|first=Los Angeles|last=Times|date=|work=latimes.com}}</ref>\n\n==Topography==\n[[File:Puerto Rico Map Topographic fixed.jpg|thumb|right|500px|Topographic map of Puerto Rico, 1952.]]\nPuerto Rico is mostly mountainous with large coastal areas in the north and south.

Most of the caverns and karst topography on the island occurs in the northern Oligocene to recent carbonates. The oldest rocks are approximately 190 million years old ([[Jurassic]]) and are located at [[Sierra Bermeja]] in the southwest part of the island. These rocks may represent part of the [[oceanic crust]] and are believed to come from the [[Pacific Ocean]] realm. Puerto Rico lies at the boundary between the Caribbean and North American [[Tectonic plate|plate]]s. This means that it is currently being deformed by the [[tectonics|tectonic]] stresses caused by the interaction of these plates. These stresses may cause [[earthquakes]] and [[tsunami]]s. These [[seismic]] events, along with [[landslide]]s, represent some of the most dangerous [[geologic hazards]] in the island and in the northeastern Caribbean. The most recent major earthquake occurred on October 11, 1918, with seismic moment estimated at 7.5 on the [[moment magnitude scale]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Suarez |first=Luis E. |editor-last=Paz |editor-first=Mario |title=Puerto Rico |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PKwJCAAAQBAJ |journal=International Handbook of Earthquake Engineering: Codes, Programs, and Examples |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |publication-date=2012 |pages=401 |isbn=9781461520696}}</ref> It originated off the coast of Aguadilla and was accompanied by a tsunami.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FqQoAQAAMAAJ |title=The Porto Rico earthquake of 1918 with descriptions of earlier earthquakes: Report of the Earthquake Investigation Commission |last=Reid |first=Harry Fielding  |last2=Taber |first2=Stephen |publisher=Government Print Office |year=1919}}</ref>\n\nLying about {{convert|75|mi|km|abbr=on}} north of Puerto Rico in the Atlantic Ocean at the boundary between the Caribbean and North American plates is the [[Puerto Rico Trench]], the largest and deepest trench in the Atlantic.

Located in the northeastern Caribbean Sea, Puerto Rico was key to the Spanish Empire since the early years of exploration, conquest and colonization of the New World.\n\n[[File:Puerto Rico geography.gif|thumb|left|250px|Geography of Puerto Rico]]\nThe [[topography]] of the main island is divided into three major regions: the mountainous region, which includes the ''[[Cordillera Central (Puerto Rico)|Cordillera Central]]'', ''[[Sierra de Luquillo]]'', ''Sierra de Cayey'' and ''Sierra Bermeja'', the coastal plains and the northern [[Karst topography|karst]] region. The ''Cordillera Central'' extends through the entire island, dividing it into the northern and southern region. The mountain region accounts for approximately 60% <!--check this fact--> of the land area.\n\nThe archipelago of [[Culebra, Puerto Rico|Culebra]], located east of Puerto Rico, north of [[Vieques]], and west of the Virgin Islands, is composed of the main island of Culebra and 28 uninhabited islets.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.lat-long.com/Lookup.cfm?Name=&State=PR&County=Culebra&FeatureType=island&Submit=Lat-Long+Search|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160303170910/http://www.lat-long.com/Lookup.cfm?Name=&State=PR&County=Culebra&FeatureType=island&Submit=Lat-Long+Search|url-status= dead|archive-date= 2016-03-03|title=ISLAND, county CULEBRA, state PR| accessdate = 2006-07-13|publisher=Lat-Long.com }}</ref> Mainly mountainous, the island of Culebra possesses renowned beaches.\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main article|Climate of Puerto Rico}}\nLocated in the [[tropics]], Puerto Rico enjoys an average temperature of {{convert|81|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|sigfig=2}} throughout the year. The seasons do not change very drastically.

Most of these rivers are born in the ''Cordillera Central'', Puerto Rico's principal mountain range located across the center of the island. The rivers in the north of the island are bigger and with higher flow capacity than those of the south. The south is thus drier and hotter than the north. These rivers make up 60 [[Drainage basin|watersheds throughout the island]], where over 95% of the runoff goes back to sea.\n\n===Flora and fauna===\n{{Main article|Fauna of Puerto Rico|List of endemic flora of Puerto Rico}}\n[[File:Puerto Rico ecosystems map-en.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|left|Map of the ecosystems of Puerto Rico]]\nAs of 1998,<ref>[http://islands.unep.ch/ISV.htm#459 Island Directory].</ref> 239 [[plant]]s, 16 [[bird]]s and 39 [[amphibian]]s/[[reptile]]s have been discovered that are [[Endemism|endemic]] to the archipelago of Puerto Rico. The majority of these (234, 12 and 33 respectively) are found on the main island. The most recognizable endemic species and a symbol of Puerto Rican pride are the [[Coqu\u00ed]]s (''Eleutherodactylus'' spp.), small frogs easily recognized by the sound from which they get their name. [[El Yunque National Forest]], a [[Puerto Rican moist forests|tropical rainforest]], is home to the majority (13 of 16) of species of Coqu\u00ed. It is also home to more than 240 plants, 26 of which are endemic, and 50 bird species, including the [[critically endangered]] [[Puerto Rican amazon]] (''Amazona vittata'').\n\n===Forests===\n[[File:Puerto rico osm-cycle.JPG|thumb|Greenery of Puerto Rico as seen in an OpenStreetMap map of Puerto Rico]]\nForests of Puerto Rico are well represented by the flora of the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF), a [[Long Term Ecological Research Network]] site managed by the [[United States Forest Service]] and [[University of Puerto Rico]]. At this site, there are four main life zones, delineated on the basis of temperature and precipitation (Holdridge System), in the Luquillo Mountains: subtropical wet and subtropical rain forests are found at low and mid elevations, lower montane rain and lower montane wet forests at high elevations. There is also an area of subtropical moist forest at low elevations on the southwest slope.\n\nTabonuco forest, so named for the dominant tabonuco tree (''[[Dacryodes excelsa]]''), covers lower slopes to about {{convert|2000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. In well-developed stands the larger trees exceed {{convert|98|ft|m|abbr=on}} in height, there is a fairly continuous [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] at {{convert|66|ft|m|abbr=on}}, and the shaded [[understory]] is moderately dense. Tabonuco trees are especially large on ridges, where they are firmly rooted in the rocky substrate and connected by root grafts with each other. There are about 168 tree species in the tabonuco forest.\n\nThe Colorado forest, named for the large Colorado tree (''[[Cyrilla|Cyrilla racemiflora]]''), begins above the tabonuco forest and extends up to about {{convert|3000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Its canopy reaches only about {{convert|49|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Soils are saturated and root mats above the soil are common. There are some 53 tree species in this forest type. At this same elevation, but in especially steep and wet areas, is palm forest, heavily dominated by the sierra palm (''[[Prestoea montana]]''). Patches of palm forest are also found in saturated [[Riparian zone|riparian areas]] in the tabonuco forest. The palm forest reaches about 15 m in height.\n\nAt the highest elevations is [[Elfin forest|dwarf forest]], a dense forest as short as {{convert|9.8|ft|m|abbr=on}}, on saturated soils. Here the trees are covered with [[Epiphyte|epiphytic]] [[moss]]es and vascular plants, especially [[bromeliad]]s, and these also cover large areas of the ground. Ascending the Luquillo Mountains through these forest types, the average tree height and diameter, number of tree species, and basal area (cross sectional area of tree stems) tend to decrease, while stem density increases.\n\nThere are more than 89 tree species in the LEF. The most common are ''Prestoea acuminata'', ''[[Casearia arborea]]'', ''Dacryodes excelsa'', ''[[Manilkara bidentata]]'', ''[[Inga laurina]]'', and ''[[Sloanea berteroana]]''. Common shrub species are ''[[Palicourea croceoides]]'', ''[[Psychotria berteriana]]'', and ''[[Piper glabrescens]]''. [[Grass]]es, [[fern]]s, and [[forb]]s are frequent on the ground, especially in canopy gaps; epiphytes are fairly common, and vines are uncommon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lternet.edu/sites/luq/fulldescription.php?site=LUQ |title=Luquillo LTER \u2013 LUQ Description |publisher=Long Term Ecological Research Network |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527174310/http://www.lternet.edu/sites/luq/fulldescription.php?site=LUQ |archivedate=2010-05-27 }}</ref>\n\n[[Puerto Rican dry forests]] are dominated by plants in the families [[Rubiaceae]], [[Euphorbiaceae]], and [[Myrtaceae]].

Fernandez is currently developing cutting edge forestry methods known as the \"Borincano Model\". The model capitalizes on the diversity of ecological niches in Puerto Rican forests and native disturbance regimes to formulate practices uniquely suited to the forests of the territory. About his model Fernandez has been known to comment, \"Soy de aqu\u00ed como el coqu\u00ed\" I am from here just like the Coqu\u00ed, a common patriotic axiom that is used to demonstrate their native ties to the island. Although incorrect, many believe that the Coqu\u00ed and its unique vocalizations are indigenous to the island of Puerto Rico. In fact however, there are thriving populations of Coqu\u00eds that, like the people of Puerto Rico, have been transported to the island of Hawaii. The Coqu\u00ed is viewed as an ecological menace in Hawaii where its song of ''co kee co kee'' is found to be an irritant by many. Needless to say that efforts to eradicate its presence in Hawaii is not a popular issue among Puerto Ricans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-coqui-frog-hawaii-20141228-story.html|title=Tiny coqui frog becomes a big problem in Hawaii|first=Los Angeles|last=Times|date=|work=latimes.com}}</ref>\n\n==Topography==\n[[File:Puerto Rico Map Topographic fixed.jpg|thumb|right|500px|Topographic map of Puerto Rico, 1952.]]\nPuerto Rico is mostly mountainous with large coastal areas in the north and south.

Most of the caverns and karst topography on the island occurs in the northern Oligocene to recent carbonates. The oldest rocks are approximately 190 million years old ([[Jurassic]]) and are located at [[Sierra Bermeja]] in the southwest part of the island. These rocks may represent part of the [[oceanic crust]] and are believed to come from the [[Pacific Ocean]] realm. Puerto Rico lies at the boundary between the Caribbean and North American [[Tectonic plate|plate]]s. This means that it is currently being deformed by the [[tectonics|tectonic]] stresses caused by the interaction of these plates. These stresses may cause [[earthquakes]] and [[tsunami]]s. These [[seismic]] events, along with [[landslide]]s, represent some of the most dangerous [[geologic hazards]] in the island and in the northeastern Caribbean. The most recent major earthquake occurred on October 11, 1918, with seismic moment estimated at 7.5 on the [[moment magnitude scale]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Suarez |first=Luis E. |editor-last=Paz |editor-first=Mario |title=Puerto Rico |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PKwJCAAAQBAJ |journal=International Handbook of Earthquake Engineering: Codes, Programs, and Examples |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |publication-date=2012 |pages=401 |isbn=9781461520696}}</ref> It originated off the coast of Aguadilla and was accompanied by a tsunami.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FqQoAQAAMAAJ |title=The Porto Rico earthquake of 1918 with descriptions of earlier earthquakes: Report of the Earthquake Investigation Commission |last=Reid |first=Harry Fielding  |last2=Taber |first2=Stephen |publisher=Government Print Office |year=1919}}</ref>\n\nLying about {{convert|75|mi|km|abbr=on}} north of Puerto Rico in the Atlantic Ocean at the boundary between the Caribbean and North American plates is the [[Puerto Rico Trench]], the largest and deepest trench in the Atlantic.
