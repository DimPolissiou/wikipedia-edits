into different daughter language(s). While the vast majority of tongues fit this description fairly well, there are exceptions.\nA [[mixed language]] often refers to a particular combination of existing ones, which may stem from different families: a [[pidgin]] is a simple language used for communication between groups; this may involve simplification and/or mixing of multiple languages. When a pidgin develops into a more stable language which children learn from birth, it is usually called a \"creole\".\nWhether for ease of use or created for use in fiction, languages can also be constructed from the ground up, rather than develop from existing ones; these are known as [[constructed languages]].\n\n== Sign languages ==\n{{See also|List of sign languages|Sign Language#Classification}} \nThe family relationships of [[sign languages]] are not well established due to a lagging in linguistic research, and many are [[:Category:Sign language isolates|isolates]] (cf.

It also includes language isolates, unclassified languages and other types.\n\n==Major language families==\n===By number of languages===\n''[[Ethnologue]]'' 22 (2019) lists the following families as containing at least 1% of the 7,111 known languages in the world:\n\n#[[Niger-Congo languages|Niger\u2013Congo]] (1,542 languages) (21.7%)\n#[[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] (1,257 languages) (17.7%)\n#[[Trans\u2013New Guinea languages|Trans\u2013New Guinea]] (482 languages) (6.8%)\n#[[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] (455 languages) (6.4%)\n#[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] (448 languages) (6.3%)\n#[[Australian languages|Australian]] [dubious] (381 languages) (5.4%)\n#[[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] (377 languages) (5.3%)\n#[[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] [dubious] (206 languages) (2.9%)\n#[[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean]] (178 languages) (2.5%)\n#[[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] (167 languages) (2.3%)\n#[[Kra-Dai languages|Tai\u2013Kadai]] (91 languages) (1.3%)\n#[[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] (86 languages) (1.2%)\n#[[Tupian languages|Tupian]] (76 languages) (1.1%)\n\n''[[Glottolog]]'' 4.0 (2019) lists the following as the largest families, of 8494 languages:\n\n# [[Atlantic\u2013Congo languages|Atlantic\u2013Congo]] (1,432 languages) \n# [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] (1,275 languages) \n# [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] (588 languages) \n# [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] (494 languages)\n# [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] (373 languages)\n# Nuclear [[Trans\u2013New Guinea languages|Trans\u2013New Guinea]] (314 languages) \n# [[Pama-Nyungan languages|Pama\u2013Nyungan]] (248 languages)\n# [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean]] (180 languages)\n# [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] (159 languages)\n# [[Tai-Kadai languages|Tai\u2013Kadai]] (94 languages)\n# [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] (81 languages)\n# [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan]] (78 languages)\n# [[Mande languages|Mande]] (75 languages)\n# [[Tupian languages|Tupian]] (71 languages)\n\nLanguage counts can vary significantly depending on what is considered a dialect; for example [[Lyle Campbell]] counts only 27 Otomanguean languages, although he, ''Ethnologue'' and ''Glottolog'' also disagree as to which languages belong in the family.\n\n==Language families (non-sign)==\n{{See also|Language family|List of languages by number of native speakers}}\n\nIn the following, each bullet item is a known or suspected language family.  Phyla with historically wide geographical distributions but comparatively few current-day speakers include [[Eskimo\u2013Aleut languages|Eskimo\u2013Aleut]], [[Na-Dene languages|Na-Den\u00e9]], [[Algic languages|Algic]], [[Quechuan languages|Quechuan]] and [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]]. \n\nThe geographic headings over them are meant solely as a tool for grouping families into collections, more comprehensible than an unstructured list of a few hundred independent families.  Geographic relationship is convenient for that purpose, but these headings are ''not'' a suggestion of any \"super-families\" phylogenetically relating the families named. \n\nThe number of individual languages in a family and the number of their speakers are only rough estimates: see [[Language or dialect|dialect or language]] and [[linguistic demography]] for further explanation.\n\n[[File:Africa

into different daughter language(s). While the vast majority of tongues fit this description fairly well, there are exceptions.\nA [[mixed language]] often refers to a particular combination of existing ones, which may stem from different families: a [[pidgin]] is a simple language used for communication between groups; this may involve simplification and/or mixing of multiple languages. When a pidgin develops into a more stable language which children learn from birth, it is usually called a \"creole\".\nWhether for ease of use or created for use in fiction, languages can also be constructed from the ground up, rather than develop from existing ones; these are known as [[constructed languages]].\n\n== Sign languages ==\n{{See also|List of sign languages|Sign Language#Classification}} \nThe family relationships of [[sign languages]] are not well established due to a lagging in linguistic research, and many are [[:Category:Sign language isolates|isolates]] (cf.

support for these proposals varies; the [[Den\u00e9\u2013Yeniseian languages]] for example, are a recent proposal which has been generally well received, whereas reconstructions of the [[Proto-World

(These were pillars associated with the chief's chair. They were put into the sea and let float to shore. Where they came ashore, the Viking who followed it would build his farm.)  At Hj\u00f6rleifsh\u00f6f\u00f0i, Ing\u00f3lfur found that his brother/close friend [[Hj\u00f6rleifr Hr\u00f3\u00f0marsson]] was dead and his slaves were missing. Out at sea he could see boats going toward a small group of islands, and he set off after them.\n\nAbducted from the north of [[Ireland]], the slaves were called westmen (Vestmenn), as before discovering Iceland, Ireland was the most western part of the world known to [[northern Europe]]ans then (c. 840). The slaves went ashore at Heimaey and took shelter in the hills. Ing\u00f3lfur hunted them and killed them in revenge for their murdering his foster brother. In the process, he named various places and landmarks. For example, he named \"Duf\u00feekja\", an area on Heimaklettur, Heimaey's highest hill ({{convert|283|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=x|; }}), after the slave Duf\u00feakur (the Icelandic version of the [[Gael]]ic 'Dubhthach,' Anglicized as 'Duffy') who was said to have thrown himself off Heimaklettur at that point, preferring to take his own life than to let Ing\u00f3lfur take it.\n\n=== First settlers ===\nIn tradition, Herj\u00f3lfur B\u00e1r\u00f0arson was said to be the first person to settle in Heimaey. According to the ''Landn\u00e1ma'', he built his farm in Herj\u00f3lfsdalur (literally: Herj\u00f3lf's valley) about 900.

At {{convert|13.4|km2|mi2}}, it is the largest island in the [[Vestmannaeyjar]] archipelago, and the largest and most populated island off the Icelandic coast. Heimaey is {{convert|4|nmi|km mi}} off the south coast of [[Iceland]]. It is the only populated island of the Vestmannaeyjar islands, with a population of 4,500. The [[Vestmannaeyjar Airport]] and the [[Westman Islands Golf Club]] taken together cover a good portion of the island.\n\nIn January 1973, lava flow from nearby [[Eldfell]] destroyed half the town and threatened to close its harbour, its main income source. An operation to cool the advancing lava with sea water saved the harbour.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Roca del elefante, Heimaey, Islas Vestman, Su\u00f0urland, Islandia, 2014-08-17, DD 036.JPG|thumb|Elephant Rock, a natural rock formation]]\n\n=== Oldest tales ===\nThe ''[[Landn\u00e1ma]]'' tells that after [[Ing\u00f3lfur Arnarson]], the first settler in [[Iceland]], spent a winter at [[Ing\u00f3lfsh\u00f6f\u00f0i]], he released his ''[[\u00d6ndvegiss\u00falur]]'' (chief's pillars) into the water and followed them west.  (These were pillars associated with the chief's chair. They were put into the sea and let float to shore. Where they came ashore, the Viking who followed it would build his farm.)  At Hj\u00f6rleifsh\u00f6f\u00f0i, Ing\u00f3lfur found that his brother/close friend [[Hj\u00f6rleifr Hr\u00f3\u00f0marsson]] was dead and his slaves were missing. Out at sea he could see boats going toward a small group of islands, and he set off after them.\n\nAbducted from the north of [[Ireland]], the slaves were called westmen (Vestmenn), as before discovering Iceland, Ireland was the most western part of the world known to [[northern Europe]]ans then (c. 840). The slaves went ashore at Heimaey and took shelter in the hills. Ing\u00f3lfur hunted them and killed them in revenge for their murdering his foster brother. In the process, he named various places and landmarks. For example, he named \"Duf\u00feekja\", an area on Heimaklettur, Heimaey's highest hill ({{convert|283|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=x|; }}), after the slave Duf\u00feakur (the Icelandic version of the [[Gael]]ic 'Dubhthach,' Anglicized as 'Duffy') who was said to have thrown himself off Heimaklettur at that point, preferring to take his own life than to let Ing\u00f3lfur take it.\n\n=== First settlers ===\nIn tradition, Herj\u00f3lfur B\u00e1r\u00f0arson was said to be the first person to settle in Heimaey. According to the ''Landn\u00e1ma'', he built his farm in Herj\u00f3lfsdalur (literally: Herj\u00f3lf's valley) about 900. The [[archaeological]] excavation in 1971 of ancient ruins in Herj\u00f3lfsdalur revealed that there had been settlement nearly 100 years earlier.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.visitwestmanislands.com | title=About Westman Islands | work=Visit Westman Islands | accessdate=December 21, 2012 | author=Jonsson, Sigurgeir}}</ref>\n\n=== Turkish Raid ===\nIn 1627, three Arab pirate ships from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-controlled [[Barbary Coast]] [[Turkish Abductions|raided]] several towns on the south coast of Iceland and outlying islands.<ref name=\"Tinniswood\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IBSVMivndEQC&pg=PT116&lpg=PT116&dq=1627+muslim+raid+iceland&source=bl&ots=KAGDvTIbhm&sig=td0SubjTY8VRkrJZAGDXscn6ePQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=nq8qUJKHKMH00gHN2oHoCQ&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=1627%20muslim%20raid%20iceland&f=false | title=Pirates of Barbary: Corsairs, Conquests and Captivity in the Seventeenth-Century Mediterranean | publisher=Penguin | author=Tinniswood, Adrian | year=2010 | isbn=9781101445310 | accessdate=2012-12-21}}</ref> They attacked [[Grindav\u00edk]] and Heimaey. In Grindav\u00edk, townspeople could flee into the lava field of Reykjanes and hide indefinitely.  Heimaey was so isolated that it was vulnerable and people suffered.

Better known as Tyrkja-Gudda (Turkish-Gudda), she was taken by the pirates from her home at Stakkager\u00f0i on Heimaey to the slave market in [[Algeria]].

And that's how it started.\"<ref name=\"AccessHollywood\"/>\n\nThough Berman was eventually surprised by the dynamic between the two, she commented on her initial hesitations about working with the couple, saying, \"I believe it was the wrong decision to let a 16-year-old marry a man in his 50s. It's uncomfortable to see... [at first] I said to my producer, 'I think this guy is a [[pedophile]]...I don't know if I can work with these people.' I don't condone it, but I do see that this is a married couple that is genuinely married and they have marital issues that needed to be worked on. I came in saying, 'She's a victim, he's a predator.' What I found out was that she has a lot more power in this relationship and he is far more powerless than I expected. His family has completely disowned him... He unfortunately has nothing besides her.\" Hutchison was also defended by Stodden's mother, Krista Keller, who praised Hutchison for the kindness with which he treats Stodden.<ref name=\"AccessHollywood\" />\n\nIn August 2013, Stodden became a housemate on the [[Celebrity Big Brother 12|twelfth season]] of the British version of ''[[Celebrity Big Brother (UK TV series)|Celebrity Big Brother]]'' but was evicted on Day 21,  two days before the season finale, after receiving the fewest votes to save against [[Carol McGiffin]], [[Louie Spence]], [[Mario Falcone]] and [[Vicky Entwistle]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Darvill |first=Josh |url=http://tellymix.co.uk/gallery/160035-pictures-courtney-stodden-louie-spence-evicted-from-celebrity-big-brother-2013-house.html |title=PICTURES!

The series features publicly known couples receiving therapy for relationship problems. According to Stodden, the couple enrolled in therapy in order to resolve issues that arose in their marriage from their age difference.<ref name=\"EntertainmentWeekly\"/> Despite the criticism leveled at the couple, Dr. Jenn Berman, the Marriage, Family, and Child Therapist who worked with the couple during their appearance on the show, stressed that she does not believe that Hutchison is, or was, seeking out young people, saying, \"He's not a predator. He's not someone, who if Courtney left him, would be trolling the Internet or high schools for underage girls. That's not his m.o. This is not a guy who was seeking out teenagers. He was teaching a class, she wanted to be an actress, it was an acting class... And that's how it started.\"<ref name=\"AccessHollywood\"/>\n\nThough Berman was eventually surprised by the dynamic between the two, she commented on her initial hesitations about working with the couple, saying, \"I believe it was the wrong decision to let a 16-year-old marry a man in his 50s. It's uncomfortable to see... [at first] I said to my producer, 'I think this guy is a [[pedophile]]...I don't know if I can work with these people.' I don't condone it, but I do see that this is a married couple that is genuinely married and they have marital issues that needed to be worked on. I came in saying, 'She's a victim, he's a predator.' What I found out was that she has a lot more power in this relationship and he is far more powerless than I expected. His family has completely disowned him... He unfortunately has nothing besides her.\" Hutchison was also defended by Stodden's mother, Krista Keller, who praised Hutchison for the kindness with which he treats Stodden.<ref name=\"AccessHollywood\" />\n\nIn August 2013, Stodden became a housemate on the [[Celebrity Big Brother 12|twelfth season]] of the British version of ''[[Celebrity Big Brother (UK TV series)|Celebrity Big Brother]]'' but was evicted on Day 21,  two days before the season finale, after receiving the fewest votes to save against [[Carol McGiffin]], [[Louie Spence]], [[Mario Falcone]] and [[Vicky Entwistle]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Darvill |first=Josh |url=http://tellymix.co.uk/gallery/160035-pictures-courtney-stodden-louie-spence-evicted-from-celebrity-big-brother-2013-house.html |title=PICTURES!

The BBC channel had closed after a year and a half when the Saudi government attempted to suppress information, including a graphic report on executions and prominent dissident views.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allied-media.com/aljazeera/jazeera_history.html |title=AL JAZEERA TV: The History of the Controversial Middle East News Station Arabic News Satellite Channel History of the Controversial Station |publisher=Allied-media |accessdate=12 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe [[List of emirs of Qatar|Emir of Qatar]], [[Sheikh]] [[Hamad bin Khalifa]], provided a loan of [[Qatari riyal|QAR]] 500 million ([[US$]]137&nbsp;million) to sustain Al Jazeera through its first five years, as Hugh Miles detailed in his book ''Al Jazeera: The Inside Story of the Arab News Channel That Is Challenging the West''. Shares were held by private investors as well as the [[Qatar]] government.\n\n[[File:Al jazeera arabic.jpg|thumb|Al Jazeera Arabic Building]]\nAl Jazeera's first day on the air was 1 November 1996. It offered 6 hours of programming per day; this increased to 12 hours of programming by the end of 1997. It was broadcast to the immediate neighborhood as a terrestrial signal, and on cable. Al Jazeera is also available through satellites (which was also free to users in the Arab world), although Qatar, and many other Arab countries barred private individuals from having satellite dishes until 2001.\n\nAt the time of the Al Jazeera Media Network launch [[Arabsat]] was the only satellite broadcasting to the Middle East, and for the first year could only offer Al Jazeera a weak [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] transponder that needed a large satellite dish for reception. A more powerful [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] transponder became available as a peace-offering after its user, [[Canal France International]], accidentally beamed 30 minutes of pornography into ultraconservative Saudi Arabia.<ref>{{cite news|last=|first=|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201141941/www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&n=france-seeks-to-soothe-arab-anger-over-porn-film-1997-07-23|title=France seeks to soothe Arab anger over porn film|date=|newspaper=Hurriyet|accessdate=17 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAl Jazeera was not the first such broadcaster in the Middle East; a number had appeared since the Arabsat satellite, a Saudi Arabia-based venture of 21 Arab governments, took orbit in 1985. The unfolding of [[Operation Desert Storm]] on [[CNN International]] underscored the power of live television in current events. While other local broadcasters in the region would assiduously avoid material embarrassing to their home governments (Qatar had its own official TV station as well), Al Jazeera was pitched as an impartial news source and platform for discussing issues relating to the Arab world.\n\nIn presenting \"The opinion and the other opinion\" (the station's motto), it did not take long for Al Jazeera to shock local viewers by presenting Israelis speaking [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] on Arab television for the first time.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Lively and far-ranging talk shows, particularly a popular, confrontational one called ''The Opposite Direction'', were a constant source of controversy regarding issues of morality and religion. This prompted a torrent of criticism from the conservative voices among the region's press. It also led to official complaints and censures from neighboring governments. Some jammed Al Jazeera's terrestrial broadcast or expelled its correspondents. In 1999, the Algerian government reportedly cut power to several major cities in order to censor one broadcast. There were also commercial repercussions: Saudi Arabia reportedly pressured advertisers to avoid the channel, to great effect.\n\nAl Jazeera was the only international news network to have correspondents in Iraq during the [[Operation Desert Fox]] bombing campaign in 1998. In a precursor of a pattern to follow, its exclusive video clips were highly prized by [[Western culture|Western]] media.\n\n===Around the clock===\n1 January 1999 was Al Jazeera's first day of 24-hour broadcasting.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2006/11/2008410115625813175.html |title=A decade of growth |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=1 November 2006 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> Employment had more than tripled in one year to 500 employees. The agency had bureaux at a dozen sites as far away as EU and Russia. Its annual budget was estimated at about $25&nbsp;million at the time.\n\nHowever controversial, Al Jazeera was rapidly becoming one of the most influential news agencies in the whole region. Eager for news beyond the official versions of events, Arabs became dedicated viewers. A 2000 estimate pegged nightly viewership at 35 million, ranking Al Jazeera first in the Arab world, over the Saudi Arabia-sponsored [[Middle East Broadcasting Centre]] (MBC) and London's [[Arab News Network]] (ANN). There were about 70 satellite or terrestrial channels being broadcast to the Middle East, most of them in Arabic. Al Jazeera launched a free Arabic-language web site in January 2001. In addition, the TV feed was soon available in the United Kingdom for the first time via [[British Sky Broadcasting]].\n\n===War in Afghanistan===\nAl Jazeera came to the attention of many in the West during the hunt for [[Osama bin Laden]] and the [[Taliban]] in Afghanistan after the [[11 September attacks|11 September 2001 attacks]] on the United States. It aired videos it received from Osama bin Laden and the Taliban, deeming new footage of the world's most wanted fugitives to be newsworthy. Some criticized the network for giving a voice to terrorists.<ref>{{cite web |author=Joel Campagna |url=http://cpj.org/reports/2001/10/aljazeera-oct01.php |title=Between Two Worlds |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists |date=October 2001 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Jennifer Bryson |url=http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2001/10/30/202458.shtml |title=Analysis: Is Rumsfeld's Criticism of Al-Jazeera Justified? |publisher=Newsmax |date=30 October 2001 |accessdate=18 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127185534/http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2001/10/30/202458.shtml |archivedate=27 January 2013}}</ref> Al Jazeera's Washington, D.C., bureau chief, Hafez al-Mirazi, compared the situation to that of the [[Unabomber]]'s messages in ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Joe Eskenazi |url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/20801/al-jazeera-not-all-bin-laden-all-the-time-d-c-bureau-chief-says/ |title=Al-Jazeera not 'all bin Laden, all the time,' D.C. bureau chief says |publisher=Jweekly |date=17 October 2003 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> The network said it had been given the tapes because it had a large Arab audience.<ref>{{cite news |author=Fouad Ajami |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/18/magazine/18ALJAZEERA.html?pagewanted=all |title=What the Muslim World Is Watching |newspaper=The New York Times |date=18 November 2001 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nMany other TV networks were eager to acquire the same footage.

It also took in fees for sharing its news feed with other networks. It had an estimated 45 million viewers around the world.

An English language web site had launched earlier in March 2003. The channel had about 1,300 to 1,400 employees, its newsroom editor told [[The New York Times]].

Prior to the arrival of Al Jazeera, many Middle Eastern citizens were unable to watch TV channels other than state-controlled national TV stations. Al Jazeera introduced a level of [[freedom of speech]] on TV that was previously unheard of in many of these countries. Al Jazeera presented controversial views regarding the governments of many Arab states on the Persian Gulf, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar; it also presented controversial views about Syria's relationship with Lebanon, and the Egyptian judiciary. Critics accused Al Jazeera Media Network of sensationalism in order to increase its audience share. Al Jazeera's broadcasts have sometimes resulted in drastic action: for example, when, on 27 January 1999, critics of the Algerian government appeared on the channel's live program ''El-Itidjah el-Mouakass'' (\"The Opposite Direction\"), the Algerian government cut the electricity supply to large parts of the capital Algiers (and allegedly also to large parts of the country) to prevent the program from being seen.<ref name=\"boot\">{{cite web |url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8215363856234901024 |title=Al Jazeera: The Inside Story of the Arab News Channel that is Challenging the We |accessdate=25 November 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115033945/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8215363856234901024 |archivedate=15 January 2008}} TV programme feat.

However, it was not until late 2001 that Al Jazeera achieved worldwide recognition, when it broadcast video statements by [[al-Qaeda]] leaders.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2460705.stm |title=Al Jazeera and Bin Laden |newspaper=BBC News |date=14 November 2002 |accessdate=12 April 2012 |first=Kathryn |last=Westcott}}</ref>\n\nSome observers have argued that Al Jazeera Media Network has formidable authority as an opinion-maker. Noah Bonsey and Jeb Koogler, for example, writing in the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'', argue that the way in which the station covers any future Israeli-Palestinian peace deal could well determine whether or not that deal is actually accepted by the Palestinian public.<ref>[http://www.cjr.org/campaign_desk/does_the_path_to_middle_east_p.php CJR.org], Does the Path to Middle East Peace Stop in Doha?</ref>\n\n<blockquote><p>The channel's tremendous popularity has also, for better or worse, made it a shaper of public opinion. Its coverage often determines what becomes a story and what does not, as well as how Arab viewers think about issues. Whether in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, or Syria, the stories highlighted and the criticisms aired by guests on Al Jazeera's news programs have often significantly affected the course of events in the region.</p>\n\n<p>In Palestine, the station's influence is particularly strong. Recent polling indicates that in the West Bank and Gaza, Al Jazeera is the primary news source for an astounding 53.4 percent of Palestinian viewers. The second and third most watched channels, Palestine TV and Al Arabiya, poll a distant 12.8 percent and 10 percent, respectively. The result of Al Jazeera's market dominance is that it has itself become a mover and shaker in Palestinian politics, helping to craft public perceptions and influence the debate. This has obvious implications for the peace process: how Al Jazeera covers the deliberations and the outcome of any negotiated agreement with Israel will fundamentally shape how it is viewed\u2014and, more importantly, whether it is accepted\u2014by the Palestinian public.</p></blockquote>\n\nAl Jazeera's broad availability in the Arab world \"operat[ing] with less constraint than almost any other Arab outlet, and remain[ing] the most popular channel in the region\", has been perceived as playing a part in the [[Arab Spring]], including the [[Tunisian revolution|Tunisian]] and [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egyptian revolutions]].

Also [[Algeciras]].\n\n==History==\n===Launch===\n'''Al Jazeera Satellite Channel''', now known as AJA, was launched on 1 November 1996 following the closure of the [[BBC]]'s [[Arabic language]] television station, a joint venture with [[Orbit Communications Company]]. The BBC channel had closed after a year and a half when the Saudi government attempted to suppress information, including a graphic report on executions and prominent dissident views.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allied-media.com/aljazeera/jazeera_history.html |title=AL JAZEERA TV: The History of the Controversial Middle East News Station Arabic News Satellite Channel History of the Controversial Station |publisher=Allied-media |accessdate=12 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe [[List of emirs of Qatar|Emir of Qatar]], [[Sheikh]] [[Hamad bin Khalifa]], provided a loan of [[Qatari riyal|QAR]] 500 million ([[US$]]137&nbsp;million) to sustain Al Jazeera through its first five years, as Hugh Miles detailed in his book ''Al Jazeera: The Inside Story of the Arab News Channel That Is Challenging the West''. Shares were held by private investors as well as the [[Qatar]] government.\n\n[[File:Al jazeera arabic.jpg|thumb|Al Jazeera Arabic Building]]\nAl Jazeera's first day on the air was 1 November 1996. It offered 6 hours of programming per day; this increased to 12 hours of programming by the end of 1997. It was broadcast to the immediate neighborhood as a terrestrial signal, and on cable. Al Jazeera is also available through satellites (which was also free to users in the Arab world), although Qatar, and many other Arab countries barred private individuals from having satellite dishes until 2001.\n\nAt the time of the Al Jazeera Media Network launch [[Arabsat]] was the only satellite broadcasting to the Middle East, and for the first year could only offer Al Jazeera a weak [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] transponder that needed a large satellite dish for reception. A more powerful [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] transponder became available as a peace-offering after its user, [[Canal France International]], accidentally beamed 30 minutes of pornography into ultraconservative Saudi Arabia.<ref>{{cite news|last=|first=|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201141941/www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&n=france-seeks-to-soothe-arab-anger-over-porn-film-1997-07-23|title=France seeks to soothe Arab anger over porn film|date=|newspaper=Hurriyet|accessdate=17 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAl Jazeera was not the first such broadcaster in the Middle East; a number had appeared since the Arabsat satellite, a Saudi Arabia-based venture of 21 Arab governments, took orbit in 1985. The unfolding of [[Operation Desert Storm]] on [[CNN International]] underscored the power of live television in current events. While other local broadcasters in the region would assiduously avoid material embarrassing to their home governments (Qatar had its own official TV station as well), Al Jazeera was pitched as an impartial news source and platform for discussing issues relating to the Arab world.\n\nIn presenting \"The opinion and the other opinion\" (the station's motto), it did not take long for Al Jazeera to shock local viewers by presenting Israelis speaking [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] on Arab television for the first time.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Lively and far-ranging talk shows, particularly a popular, confrontational one called ''The Opposite Direction'', were a constant source of controversy regarding issues of morality and religion. This prompted a torrent of criticism from the conservative voices among the region's press. It also led to official complaints and censures from neighboring governments. Some jammed Al Jazeera's terrestrial broadcast or expelled its correspondents. In 1999, the Algerian government reportedly cut power to several major cities in order to censor one broadcast. There were also commercial repercussions: Saudi Arabia reportedly pressured advertisers to avoid the channel, to great effect.\n\nAl Jazeera was the only international news network to have correspondents in Iraq during the [[Operation Desert Fox]] bombing campaign in 1998. In a precursor of a pattern to follow, its exclusive video clips were highly prized by [[Western culture|Western]] media.\n\n===Around the clock===\n1 January 1999 was Al Jazeera's first day of 24-hour broadcasting.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2006/11/2008410115625813175.html |title=A decade of growth |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=1 November 2006 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> Employment had more than tripled in one year to 500 employees. The agency had bureaux at a dozen sites as far away as EU and Russia. Its annual budget was estimated at about $25&nbsp;million at the time.\n\nHowever controversial, Al Jazeera was rapidly becoming one of the most influential news agencies in the whole region. Eager for news beyond the official versions of events, Arabs became dedicated viewers. A 2000 estimate pegged nightly viewership at 35 million, ranking Al Jazeera first in the Arab world, over the Saudi Arabia-sponsored [[Middle East Broadcasting Centre]] (MBC) and London's [[Arab News Network]] (ANN). There were about 70 satellite or terrestrial channels being broadcast to the Middle East, most of them in Arabic. Al Jazeera launched a free Arabic-language web site in January 2001. In addition, the TV feed was soon available in the United Kingdom for the first time via [[British Sky Broadcasting]].\n\n===War in Afghanistan===\nAl Jazeera came to the attention of many in the West during the hunt for [[Osama bin Laden]] and the [[Taliban]] in Afghanistan after the [[11 September attacks|11 September 2001 attacks]] on the United States. It aired videos it received from Osama bin Laden and the Taliban, deeming new footage of the world's most wanted fugitives to be newsworthy. Some criticized the network for giving a voice to terrorists.<ref>{{cite web |author=Joel Campagna |url=http://cpj.org/reports/2001/10/aljazeera-oct01.php |title=Between Two Worlds |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists |date=October 2001 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Jennifer Bryson |url=http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2001/10/30/202458.shtml |title=Analysis: Is Rumsfeld's Criticism of Al-Jazeera Justified? |publisher=Newsmax |date=30 October 2001 |accessdate=18 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127185534/http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2001/10/30/202458.shtml |archivedate=27 January 2013}}</ref> Al Jazeera's Washington, D.C., bureau chief, Hafez al-Mirazi, compared the situation to that of the [[Unabomber]]'s messages in ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Joe Eskenazi |url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/20801/al-jazeera-not-all-bin-laden-all-the-time-d-c-bureau-chief-says/ |title=Al-Jazeera not 'all bin Laden, all the time,' D.C. bureau chief says |publisher=Jweekly |date=17 October 2003 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> The network said it had been given the tapes because it had a large Arab audience.<ref>{{cite news |author=Fouad Ajami |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/18/magazine/18ALJAZEERA.html?pagewanted=all |title=What the Muslim World Is Watching |newspaper=The New York Times |date=18 November 2001 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nMany other TV networks were eager to acquire the same footage.

It also took in fees for sharing its news feed with other networks. It had an estimated 45 million viewers around the world. Al Jazeera soon had to contend with a new rival, [[Al Arabiya]], an offshoot of the [[Middle East Broadcasting Center]], which was set up in nearby Dubai with Saudi financial backing.<ref>{{cite news |author=Peter Feuilherade |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2780985.stm |title=Al-Jazeera competitor launches |newspaper=BBC News |date=20 February 2003 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n===2003 Iraq War===\nBefore and during the United States-led invasion of Iraq, where Al Jazeera had a presence since 1997, the network's facilities and footage were again highly sought by international networks. The channel and its web site also were seeing unprecedented attention from viewers looking for alternatives to embedded reporting and military press conferences.\n\nAl Jazeera moved its sports coverage to a new, separate channel on 1 November 2003, allowing for more news and public affairs programming on the original channel.

Prior to the arrival of Al Jazeera, many Middle Eastern citizens were unable to watch TV channels other than state-controlled national TV stations. Al Jazeera introduced a level of [[freedom of speech]] on TV that was previously unheard of in many of these countries. Al Jazeera presented controversial views regarding the governments of many Arab states on the Persian Gulf, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar; it also presented controversial views about Syria's relationship with Lebanon, and the Egyptian judiciary. Critics accused Al Jazeera Media Network of sensationalism in order to increase its audience share. Al Jazeera's broadcasts have sometimes resulted in drastic action: for example, when, on 27 January 1999, critics of the Algerian government appeared on the channel's live program ''El-Itidjah el-Mouakass'' (\"The Opposite Direction\"), the Algerian government cut the electricity supply to large parts of the capital Algiers (and allegedly also to large parts of the country) to prevent the program from being seen.<ref name=\"boot\">{{cite web |url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8215363856234901024 |title=Al Jazeera: The Inside Story of the Arab News Channel that is Challenging the We |accessdate=25 November 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115033945/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8215363856234901024 |archivedate=15 January 2008}} TV programme feat.

However, it was not until late 2001 that Al Jazeera achieved worldwide recognition, when it broadcast video statements by [[al-Qaeda]] leaders.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2460705.stm |title=Al Jazeera and Bin Laden |newspaper=BBC News |date=14 November 2002 |accessdate=12 April 2012 |first=Kathryn |last=Westcott}}</ref>\n\nSome observers have argued that Al Jazeera Media Network has formidable authority as an opinion-maker. Noah Bonsey and Jeb Koogler, for example, writing in the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'', argue that the way in which the station covers any future Israeli-Palestinian peace deal could well determine whether or not that deal is actually accepted by the Palestinian public.<ref>[http://www.cjr.org/campaign_desk/does_the_path_to_middle_east_p.php CJR.org], Does the Path to Middle East Peace Stop in Doha?</ref>\n\n<blockquote><p>The channel's tremendous popularity has also, for better or worse, made it a shaper of public opinion. Its coverage often determines what becomes a story and what does not, as well as how Arab viewers think about issues. Whether in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, or Syria, the stories highlighted and the criticisms aired by guests on Al Jazeera's news programs have often significantly affected the course of events in the region.</p>\n\n<p>In Palestine, the station's influence is particularly strong. Recent polling indicates that in the West Bank and Gaza, Al Jazeera is the primary news source for an astounding 53.4 percent of Palestinian viewers. The second and third most watched channels, Palestine TV and Al Arabiya, poll a distant 12.8 percent and 10 percent, respectively. The result of Al Jazeera's market dominance is that it has itself become a mover and shaker in Palestinian politics, helping to craft public perceptions and influence the debate. This has obvious implications for the peace process: how Al Jazeera covers the deliberations and the outcome of any negotiated agreement with Israel will fundamentally shape how it is viewed\u2014and, more importantly, whether it is accepted\u2014by the Palestinian public.</p></blockquote>\n\nAl Jazeera's broad availability in the Arab world \"operat[ing] with less constraint than almost any other Arab outlet, and remain[ing] the most popular channel in the region\", has been perceived as playing a part in the [[Arab Spring]], including the [[Tunisian revolution|Tunisian]] and [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egyptian revolutions]].

Typically, this is a physical journey (often on foot) to some place of special significance to the adherent of a particular religious belief system. In the spiritual literature of [[Christianity]], the concept of pilgrim and pilgrimage may refer to the experience of life in [[World (theology)|the world]] (considered as a period of exile) or to the inner path of the spiritual aspirant from a state of wretchedness to a state of beatitude.<ref>[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/beatitude]</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nPilgrims and the making of [[pilgrimages]] are common in many [[religion]]s, including the faiths of [[ancient Egypt]], [[Persia]] in the [[Mithraism|Mithraic period]], [[India]], [[China]], and [[Japan]]. The [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] customs of consulting the [[Deity|gods]] at local [[oracle]]s, such as those at [[Dodona]] or [[Delphi]], both in [[Greece]], are widely known. In [[Greece]], pilgrimages could either be personal or state-sponsored.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Pilgrims and Pilgrimage in Ancient Greece by Matthew Dillon |first= James Constantine |last= Hanges |journal= The Journal of Religion |volume= 80 |issue=  3 |date=July 2000 |pages= 543\u2013545 |doi= 10.1086/490704 |jstor=1206041}}</ref>\n\nIn the early period of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|Hebrew history]], pilgrims traveled to [[Shiloh (Biblical city)|Shiloh]], [[Dan (biblical city)|Dan]], [[Bethel]], and eventually [[Jerusalem]] (see also [[Three Pilgrimage Festivals]], a practice followed by other [[Abrahamic religion]]s). While many pilgrims travel toward a specific location, a physical destination is not always a necessity. One group of pilgrims in early [[Celtic Christianity]] were the ''Peregrinari Pro Christ'', (Pilgrims for Christ), or \"white martyrs\", who left their homes to wander in the world.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.heartoglory.com/celtic/celtic-saints.php |title= The Celtic Saints |website= Heart O' Glory |year= 2007 |accessdate= 2007-10-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071014034803/http://www.heartoglory.com/celtic/celtic-saints.php |archivedate= 2007-10-14 |df=  }}</ref> This sort of pilgrimage was an [[asceticism|ascetic]] religious practice, as the pilgrim left the security of home and the [[clan]] for an unknown destination, trusting completely in [[Divine Providence]]. These travels often resulted in the founding of new [[abbey]]s and the spread of Christianity among the pagan population in [[Sub-Roman Britain|Britain]] and in continental Europe.\n\n==Modern era==\n\nMany religions still espouse pilgrimage as a spiritual activity. The great [[Islam]]ic pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] (now in [[Saudi Arabia]]), is an obligatory duty at least once for every Muslim who is able to make the journey.

Typically, this is a physical journey (often on foot) to some place of special significance to the adherent of a particular religious belief system. In the spiritual literature of [[Christianity]], the concept of pilgrim and pilgrimage may refer to the experience of life in [[World (theology)|the world]] (considered as a period of exile) or to the inner path of the spiritual aspirant from a state of wretchedness to a state of beatitude.<ref>[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/beatitude]</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nPilgrims and the making of [[pilgrimages]] are common in many [[religion]]s, including the faiths of [[ancient Egypt]], [[Persia]] in the [[Mithraism|Mithraic period]], [[India]], [[China]], and [[Japan]]. The [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] customs of consulting the [[Deity|gods]] at local [[oracle]]s, such as those at [[Dodona]] or [[Delphi]], both in [[Greece]], are widely known. In [[Greece]], pilgrimages could either be personal or state-sponsored.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Pilgrims and Pilgrimage in Ancient Greece by Matthew Dillon |first= James Constantine |last= Hanges |journal= The Journal of Religion |volume= 80 |issue=  3 |date=July 2000 |pages= 543\u2013545 |doi= 10.1086/490704 |jstor=1206041}}</ref>\n\nIn the early period of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|Hebrew history]], pilgrims traveled to [[Shiloh (Biblical city)|Shiloh]], [[Dan (biblical city)|Dan]], [[Bethel]], and eventually [[Jerusalem]] (see also [[Three Pilgrimage Festivals]], a practice followed by other [[Abrahamic religion]]s). While many pilgrims travel toward a specific location, a physical destination is not always a necessity. One group of pilgrims in early [[Celtic Christianity]] were the ''Peregrinari Pro Christ'', (Pilgrims for Christ), or \"white martyrs\", who left their homes to wander in the world.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.heartoglory.com/celtic/celtic-saints.php |title= The Celtic Saints |website= Heart O' Glory |year= 2007 |accessdate= 2007-10-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071014034803/http://www.heartoglory.com/celtic/celtic-saints.php |archivedate= 2007-10-14 |df=  }}</ref> This sort of pilgrimage was an [[asceticism|ascetic]] religious practice, as the pilgrim left the security of home and the [[clan]] for an unknown destination, trusting completely in [[Divine Providence]]. These travels often resulted in the founding of new [[abbey]]s and the spread of Christianity among the pagan population in [[Sub-Roman Britain|Britain]] and in continental Europe.\n\n==Modern era==\n\nMany religions still espouse pilgrimage as a spiritual activity. The great [[Islam]]ic pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] (now in [[Saudi Arabia]]), is an obligatory duty at least once for every Muslim who is able to make the journey.

She was freed from prison in 1979 after being granted clemency by President [[Jimmy Carter]].\n\nLebr\u00f3n was born and raised in [[Lares, Puerto Rico]], where she joined the [[Liberal Party (Puerto Rico)|Liberal Party]]. In her youth she met [[Francisco Matos Paoli]], a Puerto Rican poet, with whom she had a relationship. In 1941, Lebr\u00f3n migrated to New York City, where she joined the [[Puerto Rican Nationalist Party]], gaining influence within the party's leadership. Within the organization she advocated [[socialism|socialist]] and [[feminism|feminist]] ideas.\n\nIn 1952, after the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico was promulgated, the Nationalist Party began a series of revolutionary actions, including the [[Jayuya Uprising]]. As part of this initiative, [[Pedro Albizu Campos]] ordered her to organize attacks in the United States, focusing on locations that were \"the most strategic to the enemy\". She  became the leader of a group of nationalists, who [[United States Capitol shooting incident (1954)|attacked]] the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1954. She was incarcerated as a result. Lebr\u00f3n remained imprisoned 25 years, when President Carter issued pardons to the group involved. After their release in 1979, the nationalists returned to Puerto Rico, where independence movements received them with a celebration. During the following years she continued her involvement in pro-independence activities, including the [[Navy-Vieques protests]]. Her life would be subsequently detailed in books and a documentary. On August 1, 2010, Lebr\u00f3n died from complications of a cardiorespiratory infection.\n\n==Early life==\nLebr\u00f3n (birth name: '''Dolores Lebr\u00f3n Sotomayor''' <ref group=note>{{Spanish name|'''Lebr\u00f3n'''|'''Sotomayor'''|plain=yes}}</ref>) was one of five siblings born in Lares, Puerto Rico to Gonzalo Lebr\u00f3n Bernal and Rafaela Soto Luciano, the other four were Aurea, Augusto, Gonzalo Jr. and Julio. Lebr\u00f3n was raised in ''Hacienda Pezuelas'' in [[Pezuela, Lares, Puerto Rico|Pezuela]], a [[Barrios of Puerto Rico|barrio]] in Lares.<ref name=\"p.17\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.17</ref> Gonzalo Lebr\u00f3n worked as the hacienda's foreman earning a salary of $30 a month and was allowed to live in a \"small house\" where he was also allowed to plant produce for his family.<ref name=\"p.19\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.19</ref>\n\nIn Pezuela Lebr\u00f3n began her education in a small community school.<ref name=\"p.20\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.20</ref> Early in her life, Lebr\u00f3n contracted [[pneumonia]] when she accidentally fell into a gutter that was full of water, as a consequence she grew with a frail body and was unable to keep up with the constant activities of her brothers without feeling fatigue.<ref name=\"p.21\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.21</ref> She developed an introverted and contemplative personality, often spending her time admiring nature around the hacienda.<ref name=\"p.21\"/>\n\nFrom Pezuela the family moved to Mirasol, also in Lares, where Gonzalo Lebr\u00f3n administered an hacienda owned by Emilio Vilellas. There she received a better education, attending a local public school.<ref name=\"p.23\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.23</ref> When Lebr\u00f3n completed the sixth grade she attended the ''Segunda Unidad Rural'', a middle school located in Bartolo, an adjacent barrio.<ref name=\"p.25\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.25</ref> She concluded her formal public school education in the eighth grade.<ref name=\"p.33\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.33</ref>\n\nLebr\u00f3n had uncommonly good looks and when she was a teenager won the first place in the annual \"Queen of the Flowers of May\" beauty contest held in Lares. Although her father was an [[atheism|atheist]], Lebr\u00f3n was baptized in the Catholic faith when she was fourteen years old along with her other siblings.<ref name=\"p.37\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.37</ref> During the baptism celebration she met Francisco Matos Paoli, who became her first boyfriend.<ref name=\"p.38\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.38</ref> Paoli and Lebron wrote letters to each other where they exchanged the poetry which they wrote.<ref name=\"p.42\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.42</ref> According to Jossianna Arroyo, Lolita wrote \"more mystical poetry, centered on what she called \"visions\" filled with religious symbolism.\"<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6DDSrolEszVbkJwVDNtSE0yWk0/view?usp=sharing | title=Living the Political:  Julia de Burgos and Lolita Lebr\u00f3n | author=JOSSIANNA ARROYO | journal=Centro Journal | year=2014 | volume=XXVI | issue=II | pages=128 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Paoli's family opposed their relationship because they considered Lebr\u00f3n a ''[[J\u00edbaro|j\u00edbara]]'' (peasant). Her father also opposed this relationship and ordered her to stop writing to Paoli. However, they both continued to write to each other until he moved out of the city.<ref name=\"p.43-44\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.43\u201344</ref>\n\nLebr\u00f3n eventually moved to San Juan, where she studied sewing and continued her correspondence with Paoli.<ref name=\"p.46\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.46</ref> She felt obligated to return to Lares because her father was severely affected by [[tuberculosis]].<ref name=\"p.66\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.66</ref> The family was forced to abandon the house in the hacienda, but was later received by Ram\u00f3n Santiago who provided them with a new house.<ref name=\"p.67\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.67</ref>\n\nLebr\u00f3n took upon herself the responsibility of taking care of her father. She would travel to a nearby town to buy medicines for her father which she gave him every seventy minutes.<ref name=\"p.68\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.68</ref> For seven days she didn't sleep or eat while attending him. Following his death Lebr\u00f3n began working by weaving clothes.<ref name=\"p.73\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.73</ref>\n\n==Political activism==\nAlthough Lebr\u00f3n was a member of the [[Liberal Party (Puerto Rico)|Liberal Party]] from a young age, she didn't display any interest in politics. However, her posture changed after March 21, 1937, when a group of militants from the [[Puerto Rican Nationalist Party]] were killed during a peaceful protest which became known as the [[Ponce massacre]].<ref name=\"p.75\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.75</ref>  Lebr\u00f3n who was eighteen years old at the time, developed a nationalistic ideology following this event.<ref name=\"p.79\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.79</ref>  During this timeframe, Lebr\u00f3n had a relationship with a local engineer, following the advice of her family. When she was twenty-one years old she gave birth to her first daughter Gladys, who was left in Rafaela Luciano's custody after Lebr\u00f3n was separated from her husband and moved to New York City.<ref name=\"p.86\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.86</ref>  After she arrived in New York City, she started to experience problems finding employment, mostly because she did not fully understand English.<ref name=\"p.93\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.93</ref>  Lebr\u00f3n worked as a seamstress in several factories. She was fired from some of her jobs because she was considered a \"rebel by her bosses\" after she protested  against the discrimination which she witnessed against Puerto Rican workers.<ref name=\"p.93\"/> This influenced her nationalistic views even further and she eventually established contact with members of the Puerto Rican Liberation Movement.<ref name=\"p.93\"/> She enrolled at George Washington College, where she studied for two years during her free time from work. She married again when she was twenty-two years old and gave birth to her second child, whom she would send to Puerto Rico to live with her mother, a year later.<ref name=\"p.94\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.94</ref>  Lebr\u00f3n decided to divorce her husband because she felt that he was oppressing her.<ref name=\"p.95\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.95</ref> In 1943, there was a [[Puerto Rican migration to New York|massive migration]] of Puerto Ricans from Puerto Rico to New York, composed mostly of {{language|es|j\u00edbaros}} seeking employment. Lebr\u00f3n grew increasingly frustrated when she observed how they were forced to live in poverty, under social decadence, and prejudice,<ref>https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lolita-Lebron</ref> and she increased her work within nationalist circles.<ref name=\"p.98-100\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.98\u2013100</ref> In 1946, she formally became a member of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, following the advice of a friend. During this time she developed an admiration for the Party's president [[Pedro Albizu Campos]], studying and memorizing his biography and ideals.<ref name=\"p.101\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.101</ref>  After joining the party, Lebr\u00f3n inadvertently included some of her own initiatives within the organization's ideals, these were influenced by  [[Socialism|socialist]] and [[Feminism|feminist]] ideals.<ref name=\"p.111\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.111</ref>  Seeking more involvement in society and politics for women, new economic systems and social reforms that would protect women and children. Her constant involvement in the party's affairs earned her several high-ranking positions, among them those of secretary, vice-president, and executive delegate of its delegation in New York.<ref name=\"p.115\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.115</ref>\n\nOn May 21, 1948, a bill was introduced before the [[Puerto Rican Senate]] which would restrain the rights of the independence and nationalist movements in the island. The Senate at the time was controlled by the PPD and presided by [[Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn]] approved the Bill.<ref>[http://academiajurisprudenciapr.org/en/revistas/volumen-vii/ \"La obra jur\u00eddica del Profesor David M.

The Bill which resembled the anti-communist [[Smith Act|Smith Law]] passed in the United States, was signed and made into law on June 10, 1948, by the U.S.-appointed governor of Puerto Rico, [[Jes\u00fas T. Pi\u00f1ero]] and became known as \"Ley 53\" (Law 53).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topuertorico.org/history5.shtml |title=Puerto Rican History |publisher=Topuertorico.org |date=January 13, 1941 |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}</ref> In accordance to the new law, it would be a crime to print, publish, sale, to exhibit or organize or to help anyone organize any society, group or assembly of people whose intentions are to paralyze or destroy the insular government. Anyone accused and found guilty of disobeying the law could be sentenced to ten years of prison, be fined $10,000 (US) or both. According to Dr. [[Leopoldo Figueroa]], a member of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives, the law was repressive and was in violation of the First Amendment of the [[US Constitution]] which guarantees [[Freedom of Speech]]. He pointed out that the law as such was a violation of the civil rights of the people of Puerto Rico.<ref name=\"LG\">[http://issuu.com/jaimepartsch/docs/jes_s_t._pi_ero_y_la_guerra_fria?mode=a_p La Gobernaci\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas T.

Truman]]'s [[Blair House|residence]], carrying a letter written by Albizu Campos and addressed to Truman. A shootout erupted between the duo and the guard stationed there, killing Torresola. Collazo was badly injured but survived and was sentenced to death by an American jury. The Puerto Rican Nationalist Party claimed that their goal was to \"draw attention to the fact of Puerto Rico's continued colonial status\", while the American government and media treated it as an [[Truman assassination attempt|assassination attempt]]. Following the sentence, Lebr\u00f3n quickly joined the \"Committee for Oscar Collazo's defense\", participating in numerous public manifestations which eventually led to a presidential pardon.<ref name=\"p.122\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.122</ref> On July 25, 1952, the official name of Puerto Rico was changed to ''Estado Libre Associado'' (commonwealth of the United States) as a constitution was promulgated by [[Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn]], the islands' first elected governor. In 1954, Lebr\u00f3n received a letter from Albizu Campos, in which he declared his intention to order attacks on \"three locations, the most strategic to the enemy\".<ref name=\"p.132\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.132</ref>\n\n==Assault on the House of Representatives==\n===Attack preparations===\nAlbizu Campos had been corresponding with 34-year-old Lebr\u00f3n from prison and chose a group of nationalists who included [[Rafael Cancel Miranda]], [[Irvin Flores]] and [[Andres Figueroa Cordero]] to attack locations in Washington, D.C. Upon receiving the order she communicated it to the leadership of the Nationalist party in New York and, although two members unexpectedly disagreed, the plan continued.<ref name=\"p.132\"/> Lebr\u00f3n decided to lead the group, even though Albizu Campos did not order her to directly take part in the assault.<ref name=\"p.132\"/> She studied the plan, determining the possible weaknesses, concluding that a single attack on the House of Representatives would be more effective. The date for the attack on the House of Representatives was to be March 1, 1954. This date was chosen because it coincided with the inauguration of the ''Conferencia Interamericana'' (Interamerican Conference) in [[Caracas]].<ref name=\"p.132\"/> Lebr\u00f3n intended to call attention to Puerto Rico's independence cause, particularly among the Latin American countries participating in the conference.\n\n===The attack===\nOn the morning of March 1, Lebr\u00f3n traveled to [[Grand Central Terminal]], where she rendezvoused with the rest of the group. Once they arrived at the [[United States Capitol]], Rafael Cancel Miranda suggested that the attack should be postponed because it was late and rainy.<ref name=\"p.136\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.136</ref> Lebr\u00f3n responded, \"I am alone\" and continued towards the building's interior. The group followed, considering the attack a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]], the most important revolutionary act in the history of the Puerto Rican independence movement, the fourth uprising after the ''[[Grito de Lares]]'', the ''[[Intentona de Yauco]]'' and the Jayuya Uprising.<ref name=\"p.136\"/> The other members of the group seemed serene and optimistic while rushing towards the legislative chamber.(p.&nbsp;136)\n\nWhen Lebr\u00f3n's group reached the visitor's gallery above the chamber in the House, they sat while the representatives discussed Mexico's economy. Shortly thereafter, Lebr\u00f3n gave the order to the other members, the group quickly recited the [[Lord's Prayer]]; then Lebr\u00f3n stood up and shouted \"''\u00a1Viva Puerto Rico Libre!''\" (\"Long live a Free Puerto Rico!\") and unfurled the [[flag of Puerto Rico]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.hollandsentinel.com/stories/022904/fea_022904040.shtml| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050322053617/http://www.hollandsentinel.com/stories/022904/fea_022904040.shtml| title=No one expected attack on Congress in 1954| agency=Associated Press| work=[[Holland Sentinel]]| date=2004-02-29| archivedate=2005-03-22| accessdate=2008-09-19}}</ref> The group opened fire with [[semi-automatic pistol]]s.<ref>Edward F.

Some 30 shots were fired (mostly by Cancel, according to his account), wounding five lawmakers; one representative, [[Alvin Bentley]] from Michigan, was seriously wounded in the chest.<ref>{{cite book| title=Five Congressmen Shot in House by 3 Puerto Rican Nationalists; Bullets Spray from Gallery| author=Clayton Knowless| work=[[The New York Times]]| date=1954-03-02| page=1}}</ref> Upon being arrested, Lebr\u00f3n yelled \"I did not come to kill anyone, I came to die for Puerto Rico!\".\n\n===Trial and imprisonment===\nLebr\u00f3n and her comrades were charged with attempted murder and other crimes. She was imprisoned in the [[Alderson Federal Prison Camp|Federal Correctional Institution for Women]] in [[Alderson, West Virginia]]. The trial began on June 4, 1954, with judge Alexander Holtzoff presiding over the case, under strict security measures. A jury composed of seven men and five women was assembled, their identities kept secret from the media. \n[[File:Lolita Lebron.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Lebr\u00f3n being led by police officers following her arrest]] \nThe prosecution was led by Leo A.

She loudly protested when the defense suggested that the group might have suffered from mental instability while committing the deed.<ref name=\"p.188\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.188</ref> On June 16, 1954, the jury found all four defendants guilty. On the morning of July 8, 1954, Lebr\u00f3n learned of her son's death minutes before the sentence was to be announced. She was quiet at the beginning of the hearing, but at one point, unable to contain herself, she became hysterical. Rover demanded the death penalty, but Holtzoff chose to sentence them to the longest terms of imprisonment possible.<ref name=\"p.193-194\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.193\u2013194</ref> In Lebr\u00f3n's case this was between sixteen and fifty years, depending on her behavior.\n\nBack at the prison, she went into shock upon receiving official notice of her son's death and did not speak for three days.<ref name=\"p.193-194\"/> On July 13, 1954, the four nationalists were taken to New York, where they pleaded not guilty to the charges of \"trying to overthrow the government of the United States\".<ref name=\"p.197\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.197</ref> One of the witnesses for the prosecution was Gonzalo Lebr\u00f3n Jr., who testified against his sister. On October 26, 1954, judge Lawrence E.

Lebr\u00f3n refused to accept letters from her sister because only letters written in English were permitted in the prison. Communication with the outside world was not allowed then. Later it was granted  after several inmates went on a [[hunger strike]] that lasted three and a half days.<ref name=\"p.218\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.218</ref> Due to her participation, Lebr\u00f3n was not allowed to perform work outside of her cell for some time, although she was eventually allowed to work at the [[wikt:infirmary|infirmary]]. While in prison, a group of judges offered her parole in exchange for a public apology, which she indignantly rejected.\n\nAfter completing the first 15 years of the sentence, Lebr\u00f3n's social worker told her that she could ask for [[parole]], but she did not display interest in the proposal, never signing the required documentation.<ref name=\"p.221\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.221</ref> Due to this lack of interest, she was mandated to attend a meeting before a penitentiary committee, where she presented a written deposition expressing her position about the parole proposal, as well as other subjects including terrorism, politics, and the United States' [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|use of the atomic bomb]].<ref name=\"p.222\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.222</ref> Following this, the other inmates reacted with skepticism over her intentions to refuse the offer, which made her distance herself from them, and focus her attention in studying, as well as writing poetry. During this timeframe, Lebr\u00f3n's interest in religion grew.<ref name=\"p.230 - 234\">Ribes Tovar et al., p.230\u2013234</ref> Lebr\u00f3n's daughter Gladys died in 1977, while her mother was in prison.\n\n==Later years, death and legacy==\n{{external media\n| align  = center\n| audio1 = {{YouTube|3Pin_Wqksxs|An elder Lolita Lebron before the \"Young Project\" hearings of 1997}}\n}}\nIn 1979 President [[Jimmy Carter]] pardoned Lolita Lebr\u00f3n, Irvin Flores, and Rafael Cancel Miranda after they had served 25 years in prison.<ref name=\"TIME\">{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,947395,00.html| title=We Have Nothing to Repent| work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]| date=1979-09-24| accessdate=2008-07-18}}</ref> Andr\u00e9s Figueroa Cordero was released from prison earlier because of a terminal illness.

She was freed from prison in 1979 after being granted clemency by President [[Jimmy Carter]].\n\nLebr\u00f3n was born and raised in [[Lares, Puerto Rico]], where she joined the [[Liberal Party (Puerto Rico)|Liberal Party]]. In her youth she met [[Francisco Matos Paoli]], a Puerto Rican poet, with whom she had a relationship. In 1941, Lebr\u00f3n migrated to New York City, where she joined the [[Puerto Rican Nationalist Party]], gaining influence within the party's leadership. Within the organization she advocated [[socialism|socialist]] and [[feminism|feminist]] ideas.\n\nIn 1952, after the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico was promulgated, the Nationalist Party began a series of revolutionary actions, including the [[Jayuya Uprising]]. As part of this initiative, [[Pedro Albizu Campos]] ordered her to organize attacks in the United States, focusing on locations that were \"the most strategic to the enemy\". She  became the leader of a group of nationalists, who [[United States Capitol shooting incident (1954)|attacked]] the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1954. She was incarcerated as a result. Lebr\u00f3n remained imprisoned 25 years, when President Carter issued pardons to the group involved. After their release in 1979, the nationalists returned to Puerto Rico, where independence movements received them with a celebration. During the following years she continued her involvement in pro-independence activities, including the [[Navy-Vieques protests]]. Her life would be subsequently detailed in books and a documentary. On August 1, 2010, Lebr\u00f3n died from complications of a cardiorespiratory infection.\n\n==Early life==\nLebr\u00f3n (birth name: '''Dolores Lebr\u00f3n Sotomayor''' <ref group=note>{{Spanish name|'''Lebr\u00f3n'''|'''Sotomayor'''|plain=yes}}</ref>) was one of five siblings born in Lares, Puerto Rico to Gonzalo Lebr\u00f3n Bernal and Rafaela Soto Luciano, the other four were Aurea, Augusto, Gonzalo Jr. and Julio.

Collazo was badly injured but survived and was sentenced to death by an American jury. The Puerto Rican Nationalist Party claimed that their goal was to \"draw attention to the fact of Puerto Rico's continued colonial status\", while the American government and media treated it as an [[Truman assassination attempt|assassination attempt]].

The date for the attack on the House of Representatives was to be March 1, 1954. This date was chosen because it coincided with the inauguration of the ''Conferencia Interamericana'' (Interamerican Conference) in [[Caracas]].<ref name=\"p.132\"/> Lebr\u00f3n intended to call attention to Puerto Rico's independence cause, particularly among the Latin American countries participating in the conference.\n\n===The attack===\nOn the morning of March 1, Lebr\u00f3n traveled to [[Grand Central Terminal]], where she rendezvoused with the rest of the group.

Centuries later in 1891 the area was colonised by the British. In 1953 Malawi, then known as [[Nyasaland]], a [[protectorate]] of the [[United Kingdom]], became a protectorate within the semi-independent [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]]. The Federation was dissolved in 1963. In 1964 the protectorate over Nyasaland was ended and Nyasaland became an independent country under [[Queen Elizabeth II]] with the new name Malawi.

The country has a [[Malawian Defence Force]] that includes an army, a navy and an air wing. Malawi's foreign policy is [[pro-Western]] and includes positive diplomatic relations with most countries and participation in several [[international organisation]]s, including the [[United Nations]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC), the [[Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa]] (COMESA), and the [[African Union]] (AU).\n\nMalawi is among the world's [[List of countries by Human Development Index|least-developed countries]]. The [[Economy of Malawi|economy]] is heavily based in agriculture, with a largely rural population that is growing at a rapid rate. The Malawian government depends heavily on outside aid to meet [[economic development|development]] needs, although this need (and the aid offered) has decreased since 2000. The Malawian government faces challenges in building and expanding the economy, improving education, healthcare, [[environmental protection]], and becoming financially independent amidst widespread unemployment. Since 2005, Malawi has developed several programs that focus on these issues, and the country's outlook appears to be improving, with a rise in the economy, education and healthcare seen in 2007 and 2008.\n\nMalawi has a low [[life expectancy]] and high [[infant mortality]]. There is a high prevalence of [[HIV/AIDS]], which is a drain on the labour force and government expenditures. There is a diverse population of [[native people]]s, [[Asian people|Asians]] and [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]], with several languages spoken and an array of religious beliefs. Although there was periodic regional conflict fuelled in part by ethnic divisions in the past, by 2008 it had diminished considerably and the concept of a Malawian nationality had reemerged.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Malawi}}\n[[File:Chongoni Rock-Art Area-110124.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chongoni Rock Art Area]].]]\nThe area of Africa now known as Malawi had a very small population of [[hunter-gatherer]]s before waves of [[Bantu peoples]] began emigrating from the north around the 10th century.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Although most of the Bantu peoples continued south, some remained  and founded [[ethnic group]]s based on common ancestry.<ref name=\"Cutter142\">Cutter, ''Africa 2006'', p. 142</ref> By 1500&nbsp;AD, the tribes had established the [[Maravi|Kingdom of Maravi]]  that reached from north of what is now [[Nkhotakota]] to the [[Zambezi River]] and from [[Lake Malawi]] to the [[Luangwa River]] in what is now [[Zambia]].<ref name=\"StateDept\" />\n\nSoon after 1600, with the area mostly united under one native ruler, native tribesmen began encountering, trading with and making alliances with [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] traders and members of the military.

As the result of Livingstone's visit, several Anglican and Presbyterian missions were established in the area in the 1860s and 1870s, the [[African Lakes]] Company Limited was established in 1878 to set up a trade and transport concern working closely with the missions, and a small mission and trading settlement was established at [[Blantyre]] in 1876 and a British [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] took up residence there in 1883. The Portuguese government was also interested in the area so, to prevent Portuguese occupation, the British government sent [[Harry Johnston]] as British consul with instructions to make treaties with local rulers beyond Portuguese jurisdiction.<ref>John G Pike, (1969).

An influential opponent of the CAF was Dr. [[Hastings Banda]], a European-trained doctor working in [[Ghana]] who was persuaded to return to Nyasaland in 1958 to assist the nationalist cause.

Following the collapse of apartheid in 1994, diplomatic relationships were made and maintained into 2011 between Malawi and all other African countries. In 2010, however, Malawi's relationship with Mozambique became strained, partially due to disputes over the use of the Zambezi River and an inter-country electrical grid.<ref name=\"StateDept\" /> In 2007, Malawi established diplomatic ties with China, and Chinese investment in the country has continued to increase since then, despite concerns regarding treatment of workers by Chinese companies and competition of Chinese business with local companies.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/may/07/china-puts-mark-malawi-presence|title= China puts its mark on Malawi|date=7 May 2011|author=Ngozo, Claire|accessdate=20 July 2011|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> In 2011, relations between Malawi and the United Kingdom were damaged when a document was released in which the British ambassador to Malawi criticised President Mutharika.

Other legal issues included limits on [[Freedom of speech|free speech]] and [[freedom of the press]], lengthy pretrial detentions, and [[arbitrary arrest]]s and detentions. Societal issues found included [[violence against women]], [[human trafficking]], and [[child labour]]. Corruption within the government is seen as a major issue, despite the Malawi Anti-Corruption Bureau's (ACB) attempts to reduce it.

Ethnic conflict and continuing migration prevented the formation of a society that was uniquely and cohesively Malawian until the dawn of the 20th&nbsp;century. Over the past century, ethnic distinctions have diminished to the point where there is no significant inter-ethnic friction, although regional divisions still occur. The concept of a Malawian nationality has begun to form around a predominantly rural people who are generally conservative and traditionally nonviolent.

Centuries later in 1891 the area was colonised by the British. In 1953 Malawi, then known as [[Nyasaland]], a [[protectorate]] of the [[United Kingdom]], became a protectorate within the semi-independent [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]]. The Federation was dissolved in 1963. In 1964 the protectorate over Nyasaland was ended and Nyasaland became an independent country under [[Queen Elizabeth II]] with the new name Malawi. Two years later it became a republic. Upon gaining independence it became a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[one-party state]] under the [[President of Malawi|presidency]] of [[Hastings Banda]], who remained president until 1994.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hastings-Kamuzu-Banda|title=Hastings Kamuzu Banda &#124; president of Malawi|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/the-cult-of-hastings-banda-takes-hold/article4273860/|title=The cult of Hastings Banda takes hold|via=The Globe and Mail}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/afraf/article/97/387/231/16549|first=John|last=Mccracken|date=1 April 1998|journal=African Affairs|volume=97|issue=387|pages=231\u2013249|via=academic.oup.com|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.afraf.a007927|title=Democracy and Nationalism in Historical Perspective: The Case of Malawi}}</ref> Malawi now has a [[Democracy|democratic]], [[Multi-party system|multi-party]] [[Government of Malawi|government]] headed by an elected president, currently [[Peter Mutharika]]. The country has a [[Malawian Defence Force]] that includes an army, a navy and an air wing. Malawi's foreign policy is [[pro-Western]] and includes positive diplomatic relations with most countries and participation in several [[international organisation]]s, including the [[United Nations]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC), the [[Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa]] (COMESA), and the [[African Union]] (AU).\n\nMalawi is among the world's [[List of countries by Human Development Index|least-developed countries]]. The [[Economy of Malawi|economy]] is heavily based in agriculture, with a largely rural population that is growing at a rapid rate. The Malawian government depends heavily on outside aid to meet [[economic development|development]] needs, although this need (and the aid offered) has decreased since 2000. The Malawian government faces challenges in building and expanding the economy, improving education, healthcare, [[environmental protection]], and becoming financially independent amidst widespread unemployment. Since 2005, Malawi has developed several programs that focus on these issues, and the country's outlook appears to be improving, with a rise in the economy, education and healthcare seen in 2007 and 2008.\n\nMalawi has a low [[life expectancy]] and high [[infant mortality]]. There is a high prevalence of [[HIV/AIDS]], which is a drain on the labour force and government expenditures. There is a diverse population of [[native people]]s, [[Asian people|Asians]] and [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]], with several languages spoken and an array of religious beliefs. Although there was periodic regional conflict fuelled in part by ethnic divisions in the past, by 2008 it had diminished considerably and the concept of a Malawian nationality had reemerged.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Malawi}}\n[[File:Chongoni Rock-Art Area-110124.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chongoni Rock Art Area]].]]\nThe area of Africa now known as Malawi had a very small population of [[hunter-gatherer]]s before waves of [[Bantu peoples]] began emigrating from the north around the 10th century.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Although most of the Bantu peoples continued south, some remained  and founded [[ethnic group]]s based on common ancestry.<ref name=\"Cutter142\">Cutter, ''Africa 2006'', p. 142</ref> By 1500&nbsp;AD, the tribes had established the [[Maravi|Kingdom of Maravi]]  that reached from north of what is now [[Nkhotakota]] to the [[Zambezi River]] and from [[Lake Malawi]] to the [[Luangwa River]] in what is now [[Zambia]].<ref name=\"StateDept\" />\n\nSoon after 1600, with the area mostly united under one native ruler, native tribesmen began encountering, trading with and making alliances with [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] traders and members of the military. By 1700, however, the empire had broken up into areas controlled by many individual ethnic groups.<ref>Davidson, ''Africa in History'', pp. 164\u2013165</ref> The [[Arab slave trade]] reached its height in the mid-\n1800s, when approximately 20,000 people were enslaved and considered to be carried yearly from Nkhotakota to Kilwa where they were sold.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5603/ |title=Malawi Slave Routes and Dr. David Livingstone Trail \u2013 UNESCO World Heritage Centre |website=Whc.unesco.org |date=9 July 2015 |accessdate=9 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nMissionary and explorer [[David Livingstone]] reached Lake Malawi (then Lake Nyasa) in 1859 and identified the [[Shire Highlands]] south of the lake as an area suitable for European settlement. As the result of Livingstone's visit, several Anglican and Presbyterian missions were established in the area in the 1860s and 1870s, the [[African Lakes]] Company Limited was established in 1878 to set up a trade and transport concern working closely with the missions, and a small mission and trading settlement was established at [[Blantyre]] in 1876 and a British [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] took up residence there in 1883. The Portuguese government was also interested in the area so, to prevent Portuguese occupation, the British government sent [[Harry Johnston]] as British consul with instructions to make treaties with local rulers beyond Portuguese jurisdiction.<ref>John G Pike, (1969).

These few employees were then expected to administer and police a territory of around 94,000&nbsp;square kilometres with between one and two million people.<ref>Reader, ''Africa'', p. 579</ref>\n\nIn 1944, the [[Nyasaland African Congress]] (NAC) was formed by the Africans of Nyasaland to promote local interests to the British government.<ref>Murphy, ''Central Africa'', p. 28</ref> In 1953, Britain linked Nyasaland with Northern and Southern [[Rhodesia]] in what was the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]], often called the Central African Federation (CAF),<ref name=CA/> for mainly political reasons.<ref>Murphy, ''Central Africa'', p. li</ref> Even though the Federation was semi-independent, the linking provoked opposition from African nationalists, and the NAC gained popular support. An influential opponent of the CAF was Dr. [[Hastings Banda]], a European-trained doctor working in [[Ghana]] who was persuaded to return to Nyasaland in 1958 to assist the nationalist cause. Banda was elected president of the NAC and worked to mobilise nationalist sentiment before being jailed by colonial authorities in 1959.

Malawi maintained close [[Malawi\u2013South Africa relations|relations with South Africa]] throughout the [[Apartheid in South Africa|Apartheid]] era, which strained Malawi's relationships with other African countries. Following the collapse of apartheid in 1994, diplomatic relationships were made and maintained into 2011 between Malawi and all other African countries. In 2010, however, Malawi's relationship with Mozambique became strained, partially due to disputes over the use of the Zambezi River and an inter-country electrical grid.<ref name=\"StateDept\" /> In 2007, Malawi established diplomatic ties with China, and Chinese investment in the country has continued to increase since then, despite concerns regarding treatment of workers by Chinese companies and competition of Chinese business with local companies.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/may/07/china-puts-mark-malawi-presence|title= China puts its mark on Malawi|date=7 May 2011|author=Ngozo, Claire|accessdate=20 July 2011|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> In 2011, relations between Malawi and the United Kingdom were damaged when a document was released in which the British ambassador to Malawi criticised President Mutharika.

Excessive force was seen to be used by police forces, security forces were able to act with impunity, mob violence was occasionally seen, and prison conditions continued to be harsh and sometimes life-threatening. However, the government was seen to make some effort to prosecute security forces who used excessive force. Other legal issues included limits on [[Freedom of speech|free speech]] and [[freedom of the press]], lengthy pretrial detentions, and [[arbitrary arrest]]s and detentions. Societal issues found included [[violence against women]], [[human trafficking]], and [[child labour]]. Corruption within the government is seen as a major issue, despite the Malawi Anti-Corruption Bureau's (ACB) attempts to reduce it. The ACB appears to be successful at finding and prosecuting low level corruption, but higher level officials appear to be able to act with impunity. Corruption within security forces is also an issue.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/af/154356.htm|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110414011935/http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/af/154356.htm|url-status= dead|archive-date= 14 April 2011|title=2010 Human Rights Report: Malawi|date=8 April 2011|accessdate=21 July 2011|publisher=US Department of State}}</ref> Malawi had one of the highest rates of [[child marriage]] in the world.<ref>[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2013/child_marriage_20130307/en/ According to the WHO]: \"The 10 countries with the highest rates of child marriage are: Niger, 75%; Chad and Central African Republic, 68%; Bangladesh, 66%; Guinea, 63%; Mozambique, 56%; Mali, 55%; Burkina Faso and South Sudan, 52%; and '''Malawi, 50%'''.\"</ref> In 2015 Malawi raised the legal age for marriage from 15 to 18.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Batha|first1=Emma|title=Malawi bans child marriage, lifts minimum age to 18|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/02/16/uk-malawi-childmarriage-law-idUKKBN0LK1Y920150216|accessdate=19 June 2015|agency=Reuters|date=16 February 2015}}</ref> Other issues that have been raised are lack of adequate legal protection of women from sexual abuse and harassment, very high [[maternal mortality]] rate, and abuse related to accusations of [[witchcraft]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/ngos/WLSAMalawi45_session.pdf |title=WOMEN AND LAW IN SOUTHERN AFRICA RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL TRUST (WLSA MALAWI) |website=Ohchr.org |accessdate=9 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1398&context=faculty_scholarship |format=PDF |title=WITCHCRAFT ACCUSATIONS AND HUMAN RIGHTS: CASE STUDIES FROM MALAWI |website=Ir.lawnet.fordham.edu |accessdate=9 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Whiting|first1=Alex|title=Attacks On Albinos Grow In Malawi As Body Parts Are Sold For Witchcraft|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/attacks-albinos-malawi-amnesty_us_57571410e4b07823f9517df2|accessdate=10 December 2016|agency=Thomson Reuters Foundation|work=Huffington Post|date=6 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2010}}, [[LGBT rights in Malawi|homosexuality]] has been illegal in Malawi.

Focusing primarily on the time period between 2010 and the current day, the status of women in Malawi will be analyzed through a range of statistical indices.\n\nThe current social status of women in Malawi is effectively estimated through indices such as female access to schooling, maternal mortality rate, and life expectancy of women from birth. These indices offer a wide lens of information on women\u2019s rights and life in Malawi. Women\u2019s access to schooling in Malawi as an index highlights how within the state, the ratio of male to female students for many age groups and for total students by gender shows women\u2019s access to schooling maintains on par with men\u2019s access<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=https://research.acer.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1031&context=monitoring_learning|title=Girls\u2019 Primary and Secondary Education in\nMalawi: Sector Review|last=Robertson|first=Sally|last2=Cassity|first2=Elizabeth|date=July 28, 2017|website=The Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER)|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|last3=Kunkwenzu|first3=Esthery}}</ref>.

The inheritance rights index gauges the ability of women to effectively own and maintain property in comparison with their male counterparts. The current inheritance rights in Malawi are found to be equal in their dispersion between male/female children and for male/female surviving spouses<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/939291535658711278/pdf/WPS8573.pdf|title=Gender Gaps in Property Ownership\nin Sub-Saharan Africa|last=Gaddis|first=Isis|last2=Lahoti|first2=Rahul|date=August 2018|website=World Bank Group|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|last3=Li|first3=Wenjie}}</ref>.

The political participation of women in Malawi as an index is effectively captured through a myriad of sources; these sources come to similar conclusions in regards to the political participation of women.

In order to help companies adopt innovative practices and technologies, the strategy makes provision for greater access to the outcome of international research and better information about available technologies; it also helps companies to obtain grants to invest in such technologies from sources such as the country's Export Development Fund and the Malawi Innovation Challenge Fund.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe Malawi Innovation Challenge Fund is a competitive facility, through which businesses in Malawi's agricultural and manufacturing sectors can apply for grant funding for innovative projects with potential for making a strong social impact and helping the country to diversify its narrow range of exports. The first round of competitive bidding opened in April 2014.The fund is aligned on the three clusters selected within the country's ''National Export Strategy'': oil seed products, sugar cane products and manufacturing. It provides a matching grant of up to 50% to innovative business projects to help absorb some of the commercial risk in triggering innovation. This support should speed up the implementation of new business models and/or the adoption of technologies. The fund is endowed with US$8 million from the United Nations Development Programme and the UK Department for International Development.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Achievements ===\n[[File:Scientific publication trends in SADC countries, 2005-2014.svg|thumb|Scientific publication trends in the most productive SADC countries, 2005\u20132014.<ref name=t2030/>]]\n\nAmong the notable achievements stemming from the implementation of national policies for science, technology and innovation in recent years are the:<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n* Establishment, in 2012, of the Malawi University of Science and Technology and the Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (LUANAR) to build STI capacity.

Ethnic conflict and continuing migration prevented the formation of a society that was uniquely and cohesively Malawian until the dawn of the 20th&nbsp;century. Over the past century, ethnic distinctions have diminished to the point where there is no significant inter-ethnic friction, although regional divisions still occur.

The siege was fought at the same time as the [[Battle of Boulogne (1940)|Battle of Boulogne]], just before [[Operation Dynamo]], the evacuation of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) through [[Dunkirk]]. After the Franco-British counter-attack at the [[Battle of Arras (1940)|Battle of Arras]] (21 May), German units were held back to be ready to resist a resumption of the counter-attack on 22 May, despite the protests of General [[Heinz Guderian]], the commander of the XIX {{lang|de|Armee Korps}}, who wanted to rush north up the Channel coast to capture Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk. An attack by part of the XIX {{lang|de|Armee Korps}} was not authorised until {{nowrap|12:40 a.m.}} on the night of {{nowrap|21/22 May.}}\n\nBy the time that the [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] was ready to attack Calais, the  British [[30th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|30th Infantry Brigade]] and [[3rd Royal Tank Regiment]] (3rd RTR) had reinforced the French and British troops in the port. On 22 May, the British troops had established roadblocks outside the town and French rearguards skirmished with German armoured units, as they advanced towards Calais. British tanks and infantry had been ordered south to reinforce Boulogne but were too late. They then received orders to escort a food convoy to Dunkirk but found the road blocked by German troops. On 23 May, the British began to retire to the old Calais walls (built in the 1670s) and on 24 May, the siege began. The attacks by the 10th Panzer Division were mostly costly failures and by evening, the Germans reported that about half their tanks had been knocked out and a third of the infantry were casualties. The German attacks were supported by the {{lang|de|[[Luftwaffe]]}}, while the Allied defenders were supported by their navies delivering supplies, evacuating wounded and bombarding German targets around the port.\n\nOn the night of {{nowrap|24/25 May,}} the defenders were forced to withdraw from the southern {{lang|fr|[[enceinte]]}}, to a line covering the Old Town and [[Citadel of Calais|Citadel]]; attacks next day against this shorter line were repulsed. The Germans tried several times to persuade the garrison to surrender but orders had been received from London to hold out, because an evacuation had been forbidden by the French commander of the northern ports. More German attacks early on 26 May failed and the German commander was given an ultimatum that if Calais was not captured by {{nowrap|2:00 p.m.,}} the attackers would be pulled back and the town levelled by the {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}}. The Anglo-French defences began to collapse in the early afternoon and at {{nowrap|4:00 p.m.}} the order \"every man for himself\" was given to the defenders, as Le Tellier, the French commander surrendered. Next day, small naval craft entered the harbour and lifted about {{nowrap|400 men,}} while aircraft of the RAF and Fleet Air Arm dropped supplies and attacked German artillery emplacements.\n\nIn 1949, Churchill wrote that the defence of Calais delayed the German attack on Dunkirk, helping to save the 300,000 soldiers of the BEF, a claim that Guderian contradicted in 1951. In 1966, [[Lionel Ellis]], the British official historian, wrote that three panzer divisions had been diverted by the defence of Boulogne and Calais, giving the Allies time to rush troops to close a gap west of Dunkirk. In 2006, [[Karl-Heinz Frieser]] wrote that the halt order issued to the German unit commanders because of the Anglo-French attack at the Battle of Arras (21 May) had a greater effect than the siege. Hitler and the higher German commanders panicked because of their fears of flank attacks, when the real danger was of the Allies retreating to the coast before they could be cut off. Reinforcements sent from Britain to Boulogne and Calais arrived in time to forestall the Germans and hold them off when they advanced again on 22 May.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Background==\n\n===Calais===\n[[File:Location Authie and Bresle River-fr.svg|thumb|{{centre|Topography south of Calais}}]]\nThe term ''[[Channel Ports]]'' refers to [[Calais]], [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] and [[Dunkirk]] (and sometimes [[Ostend]] in Belgium). The ports are the nearest to [[Cap Gris Nez]], the shortest crossing from England and are the most popular for passenger traffic. Calais is built on low ground with low sand dunes on either side and is enclosed by fortifications. There was a [[Citadel of Calais|citadel]] in the old town surrounded by water and in 1940 on the east side, the moat was still wet but elsewhere had become a dry ditch. Surrounding the town was an {{lang|fr|[[enceinte]]}}, a defensive fortification, which originally consisted of twelve [[bastions]] linked by a [[Curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]], with a perimeter of {{convert|8|mi|km|abbr=on}}, built by [[S\u00e9bastien Le Prestre de Vauban|Vauban]] from 1667 to 1707.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=160}}\n\nIn many places, the {{lang|fr|enceinte}} was overlooked by suburban buildings built in the nineteenth century. Two of the southern bastions and the wall linking them had been demolished to make way for railway lines, leading to railway sidings and quays of the {{lang|fr|Gare Maritime}} in the harbour. About {{convert|1.6|km|mi|order=flip}} outside the {{lang|fr|enceinte}} to the west was Fort Nieulay. Two other forts to the south and east were derelict or had disappeared.{{sfn|Neave|1972|p=80}}{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=220}} Outside the town, low ground to the east and south is cut by ditches, which limit the landward approach to roads raised above ground level. To the west and south-west, there is a ridge of higher ground between Calais and Boulogne, from which Calais is overlooked.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=160}}\n\n===BEF===\nWhen plans for the deployment of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) were made, the British [[Imperial General Staff]] drew from experience in the [[First World War]]. The British Expeditionary Force had used the Channel Ports as their {{lang|fr|[[entrep\u00f4t]]}}s for supplies, even though they were only {{convert|32|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the Western Front. Had the German [[Spring Offensive]] of 1918 succeeded in breaking through the front and capturing or even threatening the ports, the BEF would have been in a desperate position. During the [[Phoney War]] {{nowrap|(September 1939 \u2013 10 May 1940)}}, the BEF had been supplied through ports further to the west, such as [[Le Havre]] and [[Cherbourg]] but the Channel Ports came into use, once mine barrages had been laid  in the [[English Channel]] in late 1939, to reduce the demand for ships and escorts. When leave from the BEF began in December, Calais was used for communication and for troop movements, especially for men granted compassionate leave.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=16}}{{sfn|Bond|Taylor|2001|p=130}}{{sfn|Neave|1972|p=29}}\n\n===The Battle of France===\n{{see also|Order of battle for the Battle of France|British Expeditionary Force order of battle (1940)}}\nOn 10 May 1940, the Germans began {{lang|de|[[Fall Gelb]]}} an offensive against France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Within a few days, [[Army Group A]] ({{lang|de|[[Generaloberst]]}} [[Gerd von Rundstedt]]) broke through the French [[Ninth Army (France)|Ninth Army]] (General [[Andr\u00e9 Corap]]) in the centre of the French front near [[Sedan, France|Sedan]] and drove westwards down the Somme river valley, led by {{lang|de|[[1st Panzer Army|Panzergruppe Kleist]]}} comprising {{lang|de|[[XIX Armee Korps]]}} under {{lang|de|Generalleutnant}} [[Heinz Guderian]] and the {{lang|de|[[XXXXI Panzer Corps|XLI Armee Korps]]}} ({{lang|de|Generalleutnant}} [[Georg-Hans Reinhardt]]). On 20 May, the Germans captured [[Abbeville]] at the mouth of the [[Somme River]], cutting off the Allied troops in Northern France and Belgium. The [[Battle of Arras (1940)|Battle of Arras]], a Franco-British counter-attack on 21 May, led the Germans to continue to attack north towards the channel ports, rather than advance southwards over the Somme.{{sfn|Frieser|2005|p=279}} Apprehension about another Franco-British counter-attack led to the \"Arras halt order\" being issued by the German higher commanders on 21 May. The neighbouring XV {{lang|de|Korps}} (General [[Hermann Hoth]]) was held back in reserve and a division of the XLI {{lang|de|Korps}} was moved eastwards, when the corps was only {{convert|50|km|mi|order=flip}} from Dunkirk.{{sfn|Cooper|1978|pp=227\u2013228}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===German offensive preparations===\n[[File:C\u00f4te d'Opale topographic map-fr.svg|thumb|{{centre|Map of the ''[[C\u00f4te d'Opale]]''}}]]\nLate on 21 May, {{lang|de|[[Oberkommando des Heeres]]}} (OKH)  rescinded the halt order; {{lang|de|Panzergruppe Kleist}} was to resume the advance and move about {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} north, to capture Boulogne and Calais. The next day, Guderian gave orders for the [[2nd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Panzer Division]] ({{lang|de|Generalleutnant}} [[Rudolf Veiel]]) to advance to Boulogne on a line from [[Baincthun]] to Samer, with the [[1st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|1st Panzer Division]] ({{lang|de|Generallautnant}} [[Friedrich Kirchner]]) as a flank guard on the right, advancing to Desvres and [[Marquise, Pas-de-Calais|Marquise]] in case of a counter-attack from Calais; the 1st Panzer Division reaching the vicinity of the port during the late afternoon.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=155}} The [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] ({{lang|de|Generalleutnant}} [[Ferdinand Schaal]]) was detached to guard against a possible counter-attack from the south. Parts of the 1st Panzer Division and 2nd Panzer Division were also held back to defend bridgeheads on the south bank of the Somme.{{sfn|Frieser|2005|p=288}}{{sfn|Cooper|1978|pp=227\u2013228}}\n\n===Allied defensive preparations===\n{{see also|Battle of Boulogne (1940)#Battle of Boulogne|l1=Battle of Boulogne}}\nCalais had been raided by {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}} bombers several times, which caused disruption to military movements, confusion and traffic jams, with refugees making for Calais meeting refugees fleeing the port. The French army units in Calais were commanded by {{lang|fr|[[Commandant]]}} (Major) Raymond Le Tellier and the northernmost bastions and fortifications were manned by French naval reservists and volunteers commanded by the {{lang|de|Commandant du Front de Mer}} (Capitaine de Fregate Carlos de Lambertye). Various army stragglers, including infantry and a machine-gun company had arrived in the town.{{sfnm|1a1=Neave|1y=1972|1p=80|2a1=Sebag-Montefiore|2y=2006|2p=220}} On 19 May, Lieutenant-General [[Douglas Brownrigg]], the [[Adjutant General]] of the BEF, appointed Colonel Rupert Holland to command the British troops in Calais and to arrange the evacuation of non-combatant personnel and wounded.{{sfn|Neave|1972|p=29}} The British contingent consisted of a platoon of the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]] (A&SH) who were guarding a radar site,{{sfn|Neave|1972|p=30}} the 2nd Anti-Aircraft Regiment [[Royal Artillery|RA]], 58th (A&SH) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment RA and the [[1st Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery|1st Searchlight Regiment RA]].{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=161}}\n\nWhen the Germans captured Abbeville on 20 May, the [[War Office]] in Britain ordered troops to be despatched to the Channel Ports as a precaution. The [[20th Independent Infantry Brigade (Guards)|20th Guards Brigade]] was sent to Boulogne. The [[3rd Royal Tank Regiment]] (3rd RTR, Lieutenant-Colonel R. Keller), the 1st Battalion [[Queen Victoria's Rifles]] (QVR, Lieutenant-Colonel J. A. M. Ellison-Macartney), the 229th Anti-Tank Battery RA and the new [[30th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|30th Motor Brigade]] (Brigadier [[Claude Nicholson (British Army)|Claude Nicholson]]), were ordered to Calais.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=153}} Most of the units dispatched to Calais were unprepared for action in some respects. The 3rd RTR was part of the [[3rd Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Heavy Armoured Brigade]] (Brigadier [[John Crocker]]) and had been about to leave for Cherbourg, to join the [[1st Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|British 1st Armoured Division]], which was assembling at [[Pacy-sur-Eure]] in [[Normandy]].{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=153}} The QVR were a [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] motor-cycle battalion, nominally the divisional cavalry for the [[56th (London) Division]]. They had briefly been attached to the 30th Motor Brigade in April but then were returned to the 56th (London) Division for Home Defence, being deprived of their twenty-two scout cars.{{sfn|Neave|1972|p=64}} The 30th Motor Brigade had been formed on 24 April 1940, from the 1st Support Group, to take part in the [[Norwegian Campaign]]. After these orders were cancelled, the brigade was posted to [[East Anglia]] to meet a supposed threat of invasion.{{sfn|Neave|1972|p=90}} The main body of the brigade were the 1st Battalion, the [[Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)|Rifle Brigade]] (1st RB, Lieutenant Colonel [[Chandos Hoskyns (British Soldier)|Chandos Hoskyns]]) and the 2nd Battalion, [[King's Royal Rifle Corps]] (2nd KRRC, Lieutenant Colonel [[Euan Miller]]); these were both highly trained units, each about 750 strong.{{sfn|Neave|1972|p=89}}\n\nLate on 21 May, the QVR were ordered to proceed by train to Dover to embark for France. All the motor-cycle combinations and other vehicles were to be left behind.{{sfn|Neave|1972|p=67}} After a confused move it was realised that there had been a staff error and that there was room for the motor-cycle combinations aboard the {{TSS|Canterbury|1929|6}} but they did not arrive before the ship sailed.{{sfn|Neave|1972|p=68}} Lieutenant-Colonel Keller received orders on the night of {{nowrap|21/22 May}} at Fordingbridge to move the 3rd RTR to Southampton but during the journey the personnel train was diverted to Dover, while the vehicles continued to Southampton as planned. Keller was briefed at Dover to go to Calais and given sealed orders for the British port commander. The ships carrying the personnel of the 3rd RTR and the QVR departed Dover at {{nowrap|11:00 a.m.}} They arrived at Calais around {{nowrap|1:00 p.m.,}} under a pall of smoke from buildings on fire in the town. The QVR landed without their motorcycles, transport or [[Ordnance ML 3 inch mortar|3-inch mortars]] and only smoke bombs for the [[2-inch mortar]]s. Many of the men were armed only with revolvers and had to scavenge for rifles from those dumped on the quay by personnel hastily departing for England.{{sfn|Neave|1972|pp=65}} The 229th Anti-Tank Battery RA also arrived but in the haste to move, four of the twelve anti-tank guns had to be left behind.{{sfn|Neave|1972|p=93}}\n\nWhile they waited for their vehicles to arrive, the men of the 3rd RTR were ordered to disperse in the sand dunes and were bombed soon after. Keller met Holland who told him to take orders from the BEF GHQ but at {{nowrap|5:00 p.m.,}} Brownrigg arrived in Calais and ordered Keller to move the 3rd RTR south-west as soon as it had unloaded, to join the 20th Guards Brigade at Boulogne. After Brownrigg left, Major Ken Bailey turned up from GHQ with orders for the 3rd RTR to go to St. Omer and Hazebrouck, {{convert|29|mi|km|abbr=on}} ''east'' of Boulogne, to make contact with GHQ.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|pp=213\u2013214}} Brownrigg had gone to Dover, unaware that his orders at Calais had been superseded. He met Nicholson and briefed him to relieve Boulogne with the 30th Infantry Brigade and the 3rd RTR.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=162}}\n\nThe ship with the 3rd RTR tanks arrived from Southampton at {{nowrap|4:00 p.m.}} but unloading was very slow, as {{convert|7000|impgal|l|abbr=on}} of petrol had been loaded on deck and had to be moved using only the ship's derricks, as a power cut had immobilised the cranes on the docks. A power cut and a strike by the ship's crew for {{frac|4|1|2}} hours during the night of {{nowrap|22/23 May,}} added to the delay and the captain had intended to leave the harbour without waiting, until he was held up at gunpoint by a 3rd RTR officer.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=214}} The dock workers were exhausted, having been at work unloading rations for the BEF for many hours and it was not until the following morning that the vehicles had been unloaded and refuelled.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=161}} The cruiser tanks had been loaded first and had to be unloaded after everything else.

In the early afternoon of 23 May, it was unlikely that the British troops on the Calais {{lang|fr|enceinte}} were prepared to receive an attack, the 2nd KRRC and 1st RB having disembarked only an hour earlier at {{nowrap|1:00 p.m.}} The unloading of the 2nd KRRC vehicles was delayed until {{nowrap|5:00 p.m.}} and half of the battalion did not arrive at its positions until {{nowrap|6\u20136:30 p.m.}} An attack on Calais in the early afternoon would only have met the QVR.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=598}}\n\nThe day after Calais surrendered, the first British personnel were evacuated from Dunkirk. In {{lang|de|[[Panzer Leader (book)|Erinnerungen eines Soldaten]]}} (1950, English edition 1952), Guderian replied to a passage in [[The Second World War (book series)|''Their Finest Hour'']] (1949) by Winston Churchill, that Hitler had ordered the panzers to stop outside Dunkirk in the hope that the British would make peace overtures. Guderian denied this and wrote that the defence of Calais was heroic but made no difference to the course of events at Dunkirk.{{sfn|Guderian|1976|p=120}} In 1966, [[Lionel Ellis]], the British official historian, wrote that the defence of Calais and Boulogne diverted three panzer divisions from the French First Army and the BEF; by the time that the Germans had captured the ports and reorganised, [[III Corps (United Kingdom)|III Corps]] (Lieutenant-General [[Ronald Forbes Adam|Ronald Adam]]) had moved west and blocked the routes to Dunkirk.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=168}}\n\nIn 2005, Karl-Heinz Frieser wrote that the Franco-British counter-attack at Arras on 21 May, had a disproportionate effect on the Germans, because the German higher commanders were apprehensive about flank security. [[Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist|Ewald von Kleist]], the commander of {{lang|de|Panzergruppe Kleist}} perceived a \"serious threat\" and informed Colonel-General [[Franz Halder]] (Chief of the General Staff of OKH), that he had to wait until the crisis was resolved before continuing. Colonel-General [[G\u00fcnther von Kluge]], the [[4th Army (Wehrmacht)|4th Army]] commander, ordered the tanks to halt, an order supported by Rundstedt, the commander of Army Group A. On 22 May, when the Anglo-French attack had been repulsed, Rundstedt ordered that the situation at Arras must be restored before {{lang|de|Panzergruppe Kleist}} moved on Boulogne and Calais. At {{lang|de|[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]}} (OKW, High Command of the Armed Forces) the panic was worse and Hitler contacted Army Group A on 22 May, to order all mobile units to operate either side of Arras and further west; infantry units were to operate to the east of the town.{{sfn|Frieser|2005|p=287}}\n\nThe crisis among the higher staffs of the German army was not apparent at the front and Halder formed the same conclusion as Guderian, the real threat was that the Allies would retreat to the channel coast and a race for the channel ports began. Guderian had ordered the 2nd Panzer Division to capture Boulogne, the 1st Panzer Division to take Calais and the 10th Panzer Division to seize Dunkirk, before the halt order. Most of the BEF and the French First Army were still {{convert|100|km|mi|order=flip}} from the coast but despite delays, British troops were sent from England to Boulogne and Calais just in time to forestall the XIX Corps panzer divisions on 22 May. Had the panzers advanced at the same speed on 21 May as they had on 20 May, before the halt order stopped their advance for {{nowrap|24 hours,}} Boulogne and Calais would have fallen easily. (Without a halt at Montcornet on 15 May and the second halt on 21 May, after the Battle of Arras, the final halt order of 24 May would have been irrelevant, because Dunkirk would have already fallen to the 10th Panzer Division.){{sfn|Frieser|2005|pp=287\u2013288}}\n\n===Casualties===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-383-0337-10, Frankreich, Calais, Denkmal vor H\u00e4userruinen.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Calais in ruins after the siege}}]]\nIn 1952, Guderian wrote that the British surrendered at {{nowrap|4:45 p.m.}} and that 20,000 prisoners were taken, including {{nowrap|3,000\u20134,000}} British troops, the remainder being French, Belgian and Dutch, most of whom had been \"locked in cellars by the British\" after they had ceased to fight.{{sfn|Guderian|1976|p=118}} In 2006, Sebag-Montefiore wrote that German casualties killed and wounded during the battle were not recorded but probably amounted to several hundred.

The siege was fought at the same time as the [[Battle of Boulogne (1940)|Battle of Boulogne]], just before [[Operation Dynamo]], the evacuation of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) through [[Dunkirk]]. After the Franco-British counter-attack at the [[Battle of Arras (1940)|Battle of Arras]] (21 May), German units were held back to be ready to resist a resumption of the counter-attack on 22 May, despite the protests of General [[Heinz Guderian]], the commander of the XIX {{lang|de|Armee Korps}}, who wanted to rush north up the Channel coast to capture Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk. An attack by part of the XIX {{lang|de|Armee Korps}} was not authorised until {{nowrap|12:40 a.m.}} on the night of {{nowrap|21/22 May.}}\n\nBy the time that the [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] was ready to attack Calais, the  British [[30th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|30th Infantry Brigade]] and [[3rd Royal Tank Regiment]] (3rd RTR) had reinforced the French and British troops in the port. On 22 May, the British troops had established roadblocks outside the town and French rearguards skirmished with German armoured units, as they advanced towards Calais. British tanks and infantry had been ordered south to reinforce Boulogne but were too late. They then received orders to escort a food convoy to Dunkirk but found the road blocked by German troops. On 23 May, the British began to retire to the old Calais walls (built in the 1670s) and on 24 May, the siege began. The attacks by the 10th Panzer Division were mostly costly failures and by evening, the Germans reported that about half their tanks had been knocked out and a third of the infantry were casualties. The German attacks were supported by the {{lang|de|[[Luftwaffe]]}}, while the Allied defenders were supported by their navies delivering supplies, evacuating wounded and bombarding German targets around the port.\n\nOn the night of {{nowrap|24/25 May,}} the defenders were forced to withdraw from the southern {{lang|fr|[[enceinte]]}}, to a line covering the Old Town and [[Citadel of Calais|Citadel]]; attacks next day against this shorter line were repulsed. The Germans tried several times to persuade the garrison to surrender but orders had been received from London to hold out, because an evacuation had been forbidden by the French commander of the northern ports. More German attacks early on 26 May failed and the German commander was given an ultimatum that if Calais was not captured by {{nowrap|2:00 p.m.,}} the attackers would be pulled back and the town levelled by the {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}}. The Anglo-French defences began to collapse in the early afternoon and at {{nowrap|4:00 p.m.}} the order \"every man for himself\" was given to the defenders, as Le Tellier, the French commander surrendered. Next day, small naval craft entered the harbour and lifted about {{nowrap|400 men,}} while aircraft of the RAF and Fleet Air Arm dropped supplies and attacked German artillery emplacements.\n\nIn 1949, Churchill wrote that the defence of Calais delayed the German attack on Dunkirk, helping to save the 300,000 soldiers of the BEF, a claim that Guderian contradicted in 1951. In 1966, [[Lionel Ellis]], the British official historian, wrote that three panzer divisions had been diverted by the defence of Boulogne and Calais, giving the Allies time to rush troops to close a gap west of Dunkirk. In 2006, [[Karl-Heinz Frieser]] wrote that the halt order issued to the German unit commanders because of the Anglo-French attack at the Battle of Arras (21 May) had a greater effect than the siege. Hitler and the higher German commanders panicked because of their fears of flank attacks, when the real danger was of the Allies retreating to the coast before they could be cut off. Reinforcements sent from Britain to Boulogne and Calais arrived in time to forestall the Germans and hold them off when they advanced again on 22 May.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Background==\n\n===Calais===\n[[File:Location Authie and Bresle River-fr.svg|thumb|{{centre|Topography south of Calais}}]]\nThe term ''[[Channel Ports]]'' refers to [[Calais]], [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] and [[Dunkirk]] (and sometimes [[Ostend]] in Belgium). The ports are the nearest to [[Cap Gris Nez]], the shortest crossing from England and are the most popular for passenger traffic. Calais is built on low ground with low sand dunes on either side and is enclosed by fortifications. There was a [[Citadel of Calais|citadel]] in the old town surrounded by water and in 1940 on the east side, the moat was still wet but elsewhere had become a dry ditch. Surrounding the town was an {{lang|fr|[[enceinte]]}}, a defensive fortification, which originally consisted of twelve [[bastions]] linked by a [[Curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]], with a perimeter of {{convert|8|mi|km|abbr=on}}, built by [[S\u00e9bastien Le Prestre de Vauban|Vauban]] from 1667 to 1707.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=160}}\n\nIn many places, the {{lang|fr|enceinte}} was overlooked by suburban buildings built in the nineteenth century. Two of the southern bastions and the wall linking them had been demolished to make way for railway lines, leading to railway sidings and quays of the {{lang|fr|Gare Maritime}} in the harbour. About {{convert|1.6|km|mi|order=flip}} outside the {{lang|fr|enceinte}} to the west was Fort Nieulay. Two other forts to the south and east were derelict or had disappeared.{{sfn|Neave|1972|p=80}}{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=220}} Outside the town, low ground to the east and south is cut by ditches, which limit the landward approach to roads raised above ground level. To the west and south-west, there is a ridge of higher ground between Calais and Boulogne, from which Calais is overlooked.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=160}}\n\n===BEF===\nWhen plans for the deployment of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) were made, the British [[Imperial General Staff]] drew from experience in the [[First World War]]. The British Expeditionary Force had used the Channel Ports as their {{lang|fr|[[entrep\u00f4t]]}}s for supplies, even though they were only {{convert|32|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the Western Front. Had the German [[Spring Offensive]] of 1918 succeeded in breaking through the front and capturing or even threatening the ports, the BEF would have been in a desperate position. During the [[Phoney War]] {{nowrap|(September 1939 \u2013 10 May 1940)}}, the BEF had been supplied through ports further to the west, such as [[Le Havre]] and [[Cherbourg]] but the Channel Ports came into use, once mine barrages had been laid  in the [[English Channel]] in late 1939, to reduce the demand for ships and escorts. When leave from the BEF began in December, Calais was used for communication and for troop movements, especially for men granted compassionate leave.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=16}}{{sfn|Bond|Taylor|2001|p=130}}{{sfn|Neave|1972|p=29}}\n\n===The Battle of France===\n{{see also|Order of battle for the Battle of France|British Expeditionary Force order of battle (1940)}}\nOn 10 May 1940, the Germans began {{lang|de|[[Fall Gelb]]}} an offensive against France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Within a few days, [[Army Group A]] ({{lang|de|[[Generaloberst]]}} [[Gerd von Rundstedt]]) broke through the French [[Ninth Army (France)|Ninth Army]] (General [[Andr\u00e9 Corap]]) in the centre of the French front near [[Sedan, France|Sedan]] and drove westwards down the Somme river valley, led by {{lang|de|[[1st Panzer Army|Panzergruppe Kleist]]}} comprising {{lang|de|[[XIX Armee Korps]]}} under {{lang|de|Generalleutnant}} [[Heinz Guderian]] and the {{lang|de|[[XXXXI Panzer Corps|XLI Armee Korps]]}} ({{lang|de|Generalleutnant}} [[Georg-Hans Reinhardt]]). On 20 May, the Germans captured [[Abbeville]] at the mouth of the [[Somme River]], cutting off the Allied troops in Northern France and Belgium. The [[Battle of Arras (1940)|Battle of Arras]], a Franco-British counter-attack on 21 May, led the Germans to continue to attack north towards the channel ports, rather than advance southwards over the Somme.{{sfn|Frieser|2005|p=279}} Apprehension about another Franco-British counter-attack led to the \"Arras halt order\" being issued by the German higher commanders on 21 May. The neighbouring XV {{lang|de|Korps}} (General [[Hermann Hoth]]) was held back in reserve and a division of the XLI {{lang|de|Korps}} was moved eastwards, when the corps was only {{convert|50|km|mi|order=flip}} from Dunkirk.{{sfn|Cooper|1978|pp=227\u2013228}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===German offensive preparations===\n[[File:C\u00f4te d'Opale topographic map-fr.svg|thumb|{{centre|Map of the ''[[C\u00f4te d'Opale]]''}}]]\nLate on 21 May, {{lang|de|[[Oberkommando des Heeres]]}} (OKH)  rescinded the halt order; {{lang|de|Panzergruppe Kleist}} was to resume the advance and move about {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} north, to capture Boulogne and Calais. The next day, Guderian gave orders for the [[2nd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Panzer Division]] ({{lang|de|Generalleutnant}} [[Rudolf Veiel]]) to advance to Boulogne on a line from [[Baincthun]] to Samer, with the [[1st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|1st Panzer Division]] ({{lang|de|Generallautnant}} [[Friedrich Kirchner]]) as a flank guard on the right, advancing to Desvres and [[Marquise, Pas-de-Calais|Marquise]] in case of a counter-attack from Calais; the 1st Panzer Division reaching the vicinity of the port during the late afternoon.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=155}} The [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] ({{lang|de|Generalleutnant}} [[Ferdinand Schaal]]) was detached to guard against a possible counter-attack from the south. Parts of the 1st Panzer Division and 2nd Panzer Division were also held back to defend bridgeheads on the south bank of the Somme.{{sfn|Frieser|2005|p=288}}{{sfn|Cooper|1978|pp=227\u2013228}}\n\n===Allied defensive preparations===\n{{see also|Battle of Boulogne (1940)#Battle of Boulogne|l1=Battle of Boulogne}}\nCalais had been raided by {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}} bombers several times, which caused disruption to military movements, confusion and traffic jams, with refugees making for Calais meeting refugees fleeing the port. The French army units in Calais were commanded by {{lang|fr|[[Commandant]]}} (Major) Raymond Le Tellier and the northernmost bastions and fortifications were manned by French naval reservists and volunteers commanded by the {{lang|de|Commandant du Front de Mer}} (Capitaine de Fregate Carlos de Lambertye). Various army stragglers, including infantry and a machine-gun company had arrived in the town.{{sfnm|1a1=Neave|1y=1972|1p=80|2a1=Sebag-Montefiore|2y=2006|2p=220}} On 19 May, Lieutenant-General [[Douglas Brownrigg]], the [[Adjutant General]] of the BEF, appointed Colonel Rupert Holland to command the British troops in Calais and to arrange the evacuation of non-combatant personnel and wounded.{{sfn|Neave|1972|p=29}} The British contingent consisted of a platoon of the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]] (A&SH) who were guarding a radar site,{{sfn|Neave|1972|p=30}} the 2nd Anti-Aircraft Regiment [[Royal Artillery|RA]], 58th (A&SH) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment RA and the [[1st Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery|1st Searchlight Regiment RA]].{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=161}}\n\nWhen the Germans captured Abbeville on 20 May, the [[War Office]] in Britain ordered troops to be despatched to the Channel Ports as a precaution. The [[20th Independent Infantry Brigade (Guards)|20th Guards Brigade]] was sent to Boulogne. The [[3rd Royal Tank Regiment]] (3rd RTR, Lieutenant-Colonel R. Keller), the 1st Battalion [[Queen Victoria's Rifles]] (QVR, Lieutenant-Colonel J. A. M. Ellison-Macartney), the 229th Anti-Tank Battery RA and the new [[30th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|30th Motor Brigade]] (Brigadier [[Claude Nicholson (British Army)|Claude Nicholson]]), were ordered to Calais.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=153}} Most of the units dispatched to Calais were unprepared for action in some respects. The 3rd RTR was part of the [[3rd Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Heavy Armoured Brigade]] (Brigadier [[John Crocker]]) and had been about to leave for Cherbourg, to join the [[1st Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|British 1st Armoured Division]], which was assembling at [[Pacy-sur-Eure]] in [[Normandy]].{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=153}} The QVR were a [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] motor-cycle battalion, nominally the divisional cavalry for the [[56th (London) Division]]. They had briefly been attached to the 30th Motor Brigade in April but then were returned to the 56th (London) Division for Home Defence, being deprived of their twenty-two scout cars.{{sfn|Neave|1972|p=64}} The 30th Motor Brigade had been formed on 24 April 1940, from the 1st Support Group, to take part in the [[Norwegian Campaign]]. After these orders were cancelled, the brigade was posted to [[East Anglia]] to meet a supposed threat of invasion.{{sfn|Neave|1972|p=90}} The main body of the brigade were the 1st Battalion, the [[Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)|Rifle Brigade]] (1st RB, Lieutenant Colonel [[Chandos Hoskyns (British Soldier)|Chandos Hoskyns]]) and the 2nd Battalion, [[King's Royal Rifle Corps]] (2nd KRRC, Lieutenant Colonel [[Euan Miller]]); these were both highly trained units, each about 750 strong.{{sfn|Neave|1972|p=89}}\n\nLate on 21 May, the QVR were ordered to proceed by train to Dover to embark for France. All the motor-cycle combinations and other vehicles were to be left behind.{{sfn|Neave|1972|p=67}} After a confused move it was realised that there had been a staff error and that there was room for the motor-cycle combinations aboard the {{TSS|Canterbury|1929|6}} but they did not arrive before the ship sailed.{{sfn|Neave|1972|p=68}} Lieutenant-Colonel Keller received orders on the night of {{nowrap|21/22 May}} at Fordingbridge to move the 3rd RTR to Southampton but during the journey the personnel train was diverted to Dover, while the vehicles continued to Southampton as planned. Keller was briefed at Dover to go to Calais and given sealed orders for the British port commander. The ships carrying the personnel of the 3rd RTR and the QVR departed Dover at {{nowrap|11:00 a.m.}} They arrived at Calais around {{nowrap|1:00 p.m.,}} under a pall of smoke from buildings on fire in the town. The QVR landed without their motorcycles, transport or [[Ordnance ML 3 inch mortar|3-inch mortars]] and only smoke bombs for the [[2-inch mortar]]s. Many of the men were armed only with revolvers and had to scavenge for rifles from those dumped on the quay by personnel hastily departing for England.{{sfn|Neave|1972|pp=65}} The 229th Anti-Tank Battery RA also arrived but in the haste to move, four of the twelve anti-tank guns had to be left behind.{{sfn|Neave|1972|p=93}}\n\nWhile they waited for their vehicles to arrive, the men of the 3rd RTR were ordered to disperse in the sand dunes and were bombed soon after. Keller met Holland who told him to take orders from the BEF GHQ but at {{nowrap|5:00 p.m.,}} Brownrigg arrived in Calais and ordered Keller to move the 3rd RTR south-west as soon as it had unloaded, to join the 20th Guards Brigade at Boulogne. After Brownrigg left, Major Ken Bailey turned up from GHQ with orders for the 3rd RTR to go to St. Omer and Hazebrouck, {{convert|29|mi|km|abbr=on}} ''east'' of Boulogne, to make contact with GHQ.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|pp=213\u2013214}} Brownrigg had gone to Dover, unaware that his orders at Calais had been superseded. He met Nicholson and briefed him to relieve Boulogne with the 30th Infantry Brigade and the 3rd RTR.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=162}}\n\nThe ship with the 3rd RTR tanks arrived from Southampton at {{nowrap|4:00 p.m.}} but unloading was very slow, as {{convert|7000|impgal|l|abbr=on}} of petrol had been loaded on deck and had to be moved using only the ship's derricks, as a power cut had immobilised the cranes on the docks. A power cut and a strike by the ship's crew for {{frac|4|1|2}} hours during the night of {{nowrap|22/23 May,}} added to the delay and the captain had intended to leave the harbour without waiting, until he was held up at gunpoint by a 3rd RTR officer.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=214}} The dock workers were exhausted, having been at work unloading rations for the BEF for many hours and it was not until the following morning that the vehicles had been unloaded and refuelled.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=161}} The cruiser tanks had been loaded first and had to be unloaded after everything else.

The defenders on the ramparts ran short of ammunition and the 229th Battery was reduced to two operational anti-tank guns. The Germans had great difficulty in identifying British defensive positions and by {{nowrap|4:00 a.m.,}} had managed only a short advance.

In the early afternoon of 23 May, it was unlikely that the British troops on the Calais {{lang|fr|enceinte}} were prepared to receive an attack, the 2nd KRRC and 1st RB having disembarked only an hour earlier at {{nowrap|1:00 p.m.}} The unloading of the 2nd KRRC vehicles was delayed until {{nowrap|5:00 p.m.}} and half of the battalion did not arrive at its positions until {{nowrap|6\u20136:30 p.m.}} An attack on Calais in the early afternoon would only have met the QVR.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=598}}\n\nThe day after Calais surrendered, the first British personnel were evacuated from Dunkirk. In {{lang|de|[[Panzer Leader (book)|Erinnerungen eines Soldaten]]}} (1950, English edition 1952), Guderian replied to a passage in [[The Second World War (book series)|''Their Finest Hour'']] (1949) by Winston Churchill, that Hitler had ordered the panzers to stop outside Dunkirk in the hope that the British would make peace overtures. Guderian denied this and wrote that the defence of Calais was heroic but made no difference to the course of events at Dunkirk.{{sfn|Guderian|1976|p=120}} In 1966, [[Lionel Ellis]], the British official historian, wrote that the defence of Calais and Boulogne diverted three panzer divisions from the French First Army and the BEF; by the time that the Germans had captured the ports and reorganised, [[III Corps (United Kingdom)|III Corps]] (Lieutenant-General [[Ronald Forbes Adam|Ronald Adam]]) had moved west and blocked the routes to Dunkirk.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=168}}\n\nIn 2005, Karl-Heinz Frieser wrote that the Franco-British counter-attack at Arras on 21 May, had a disproportionate effect on the Germans, because the German higher commanders were apprehensive about flank security. [[Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist|Ewald von Kleist]], the commander of {{lang|de|Panzergruppe Kleist}} perceived a \"serious threat\" and informed Colonel-General [[Franz Halder]] (Chief of the General Staff of OKH), that he had to wait until the crisis was resolved before continuing. Colonel-General [[G\u00fcnther von Kluge]], the [[4th Army (Wehrmacht)|4th Army]] commander, ordered the tanks to halt, an order supported by Rundstedt, the commander of Army Group A. On 22 May, when the Anglo-French attack had been repulsed, Rundstedt ordered that the situation at Arras must be restored before {{lang|de|Panzergruppe Kleist}} moved on Boulogne and Calais. At {{lang|de|[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]}} (OKW, High Command of the Armed Forces) the panic was worse and Hitler contacted Army Group A on 22 May, to order all mobile units to operate either side of Arras and further west; infantry units were to operate to the east of the town.{{sfn|Frieser|2005|p=287}}\n\nThe crisis among the higher staffs of the German army was not apparent at the front and Halder formed the same conclusion as Guderian, the real threat was that the Allies would retreat to the channel coast and a race for the channel ports began. Guderian had ordered the 2nd Panzer Division to capture Boulogne, the 1st Panzer Division to take Calais and the 10th Panzer Division to seize Dunkirk, before the halt order. Most of the BEF and the French First Army were still {{convert|100|km|mi|order=flip}} from the coast but despite delays, British troops were sent from England to Boulogne and Calais just in time to forestall the XIX Corps panzer divisions on 22 May. Had the panzers advanced at the same speed on 21 May as they had on 20 May, before the halt order stopped their advance for {{nowrap|24 hours,}} Boulogne and Calais would have fallen easily. (Without a halt at Montcornet on 15 May and the second halt on 21 May, after the Battle of Arras, the final halt order of 24 May would have been irrelevant, because Dunkirk would have already fallen to the 10th Panzer Division.){{sfn|Frieser|2005|pp=287\u2013288}}\n\n===Casualties===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-383-0337-10, Frankreich, Calais, Denkmal vor H\u00e4userruinen.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Calais in ruins after the siege}}]]\nIn 1952, Guderian wrote that the British surrendered at {{nowrap|4:45 p.m.}} and that 20,000 prisoners were taken, including {{nowrap|3,000\u20134,000}} British troops, the remainder being French, Belgian and Dutch, most of whom had been \"locked in cellars by the British\" after they had ceased to fight.{{sfn|Guderian|1976|p=118}} In 2006, Sebag-Montefiore wrote that German casualties killed and wounded during the battle were not recorded but probably amounted to several hundred.
