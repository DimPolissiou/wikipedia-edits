''Drum'' is a [[museum ship]] in [[Mobile, Alabama]], at [[Battleship Memorial Park]].\n\n''Drum'' was laid down on 11 September 1940 at [[Portsmouth Naval Shipyard]], [[Kittery, Maine]]. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 12 May 1941, sponsored by Mrs. Beatrice M. Holcomb, wife of Major General [[Thomas Holcomb]], Commandant of the United States Marine Corps. The boat was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 1 November 1941, with [[Commander]] [[Robert H. Rice]] in command.\n\n''Drum'' was the twelfth of the ''Gato'' class but was the first completed and the first to enter combat in [[World War II]]. She is the oldest of her class still in existence.\n\n==Service history==\n\n===World War II===\n[[Image:USS Drum (SS-228).png|left|''Drum'', c. 1943]]\n\n===First patrol===\n''Drum'' arrived at [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] from the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] on 1 April 1942, and after a voyage to [[Midway Atoll]], departed Pearl Harbor on 14 April on her first war patrol. Cruising off the coast of [[Japan]], she sank the Japanese [[seaplane tender]] [[Japanese_seaplane_carrier_Mizuho|''Mizuho'']] on 2 May and afterwards endured a 16-hour [[depth charge]] attack consisting of 31 depth charges. Later that month she sank three cargo ships before returning to Pearl Harbor on 12 June to refit.<ref>{{cite web |title=USS Drum History |url=https://www.ussalabama.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/USS-DRUM-History.pdf |website=USS Alabama Battleship Memorial Park |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Second patrol===\n''Drum''{{'}}s second war patrol, which she made in the waters between [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] and [[Kavieng]] from 10 July{{spaced ndash}}2 September, found her efforts frustrated by poor torpedo performance, but she damaged one freighter before returning to Midway to refit.\n\n===Third patrol===\nThe submarine sailed from Midway on 23 September on her third war patrol, bound for the eastern coast of [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]]. On 8 October, she contacted a convoy of four freighters, and defying the air cover guarding the ships, sank the 5652 ton cargo/passenger ship IJA ''Hague Maru'' laden with 4000 tons of wheat, machines, steel, oil, automobiles and captured paper money for the Formosa bank, before aerial bombs forced her deep. The next day, ''Drum'' underwent a severe depth charging from several escorts after she attacked and sank the 2461 ton cargo ship ''Hachimanzan Maru''.  On 20 October, she sank the 5106 ton ''Ryunan Maru'', one of three air-escorted cargo ships, and damaged at least two more ships before completing her patrol at Pearl Harbor on 8 November.\n\n===Fourth patrol===\nOn her fourth patrol, 29 November 1942{{spaced ndash}}24 January 1943, ''Drum'' carried out the demanding task of planting mines in heavily traveled [[Bungo Suido]]. On 12 December, she spotted the Japanese aircraft carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Ry\u016bh\u014d|Ry\u016bh\u014d]], which had a full deck-load of planes. Although taking water forward due to faulty valves, ''Drum'' launched torpedoes at this choice target, scoring two hits, and causing the carrier to list so far that her flight deck became completely visible. Also visible was a destroyer bearing down, and splashes that indicated ''Drum''{{'}}s periscope was under fire. As the submarine dove, she lost depth control and her port shaft stopped turning. As she made emergency repairs, she underwent two waves of depth charging. When she surfaced several hours later to see what had become of her prey, which had escaped, an aircraft forced her down again. During this patrol, ''Drum'' also damaged a large tanker, another choice target.\n\n===Fifth and sixth patrols===\nAfter a thorough overhaul at Pearl Harbor, ''Drum'' made her fifth war patrol, 24 March{{spaced ndash}}13 May, searching waters south of Truk after she had completed a photographic reconnaissance of [[Nauru]]. She sank the cargo vessel ''Yuzan (Oyama) Maru'' of 3809 tons on 9 April, and on 18 April she sank the 6380 ton cargo ship ''Nisshun Maru'', carrying a cargo of ammunition, then refitted at [[Brisbane]], Australia. Her sixth war patrol, 7 June{{spaced ndash}}26 July, found her north of the [[Bismarck Archipelago]], where on 17 June she found a 3 ship convoy consisting of 2 cargo ships under escort by a destroyer and sank the 5086 ton cargo-passenger ship ''Myoko Maru''.\n\n===Seventh patrol===\nShe returned to Brisbane to replenish, and on 16 August sailed on her seventh war patrol. She damaged the 6439 ton cargo ship ''Yamagiri Maru'', carrying a load of raw materials for the war effort, with two torpedoes on 28 August. Adding to her impressive list of sinkings, she sank the 1334 ton cargo ship ''Hakutetsu Maru #13'' on 8 September, as well and patrolled off [[New Georgia]] during the landings there. She put into [[Tulagi]] from 29 September{{spaced ndash}}2 October to repair her [[gyrocompass]], then sailed on to Brisbane.\n\n===Eighth patrol===\n''Drum'' sailed on 2 November for her eighth war patrol, coordinated with the landings at [[Cape Torokina]]. Patrolling between the [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]] and [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]], she sank the submarine tender ''[[Hie Maru]]'' (11,621 tons) on 17 November, and on 22 November attacked a convoy of four freighters. The convoy's escorts delivered three depth charge attacks. ''Drum'' was heavily damaged and ordered to Pearl Harbor. She arrived there on 5 December; inspection revealed that the [[conning tower]] needed to be replaced, which required that she sail to the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].\n\n===Ninth patrol===\nReturning to Pearl Harbor on 29 March 1944, ''Drum'' sailed 11 days later on her ninth war patrol, during which she patrolled the waters around [[Iwo Jima]] and other islands in the [[Bonin Islands]]. No worthy targets were contacted, but a reconnaissance of [[Chichi Jima]] gained valuable intelligence for bombardment of the island later by surface ships.\n\n===Tenth and Eleventh patrols===\nThe submarine refitted at [[Majuro]] from 31 May{{spaced ndash}}24 June, then sailed on her 10th war patrol to give lifeguard service for raids on [[Yap]] and [[Palau]]. She sank a 125-ton ''[[sampan]]'' on 29 July, capturing two prisoners whom she brought back to Pearl Harbor on 14 August. She sailed for [[Surigao Strait]] on 9 September on her 11th war patrol, and after two weeks in the Strait with no contact, she was ordered north to the [[South China Sea]]. Here she patrolled during the [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]] landings and the decisive [[Battle for Leyte Gulf]], and on 24 October sank the passenger-cargo ship ''Shikisan Maru'' (4725 tons). On 26 October ''Drum'', made contact with a 13 ship convoy (10 merchant with 3 escorts)  sinking two passenger-cargo ships, ''Taihaku Maru'' (6886 tons), ''Taisho Maru'' (6886 tons), and one transport ship, ''Tatsura Maru'', (6420 tons), also damaging another passenger-cargo ship, ''Aoki Maru'' (3710 tons), bound for the [[Philippines]] with Japanese reinforcements. While sailing for Majuro for refit, ''Drum'' searched east of [[Luzon Strait]] for downed aviators.\n\n===Twelfth, Thirteenth and last patrols===\n''Drum'' replenished and made repairs at Majuro from 8 November{{spaced ndash}}7 December, then sailed for the [[Nansei Shoto]] on her 12th war patrol. Only one contact was made during this patrol, and she returned to [[Guam]] on 17 January 1945. During her 13th war patrol, from 11 February{{spaced ndash}}2 April, ''Drum'' played a part in the assaults on both Iwo Jima and [[Okinawa]], providing lifeguard service for air strikes on the Nansei Shoto and the Japanese home islands as bases were neutralized before both invasions. Returning to Pearl Harbor, ''Drum'' sailed to the West Coast for another overhaul, and after training at Pearl Harbor, cleared Midway on 9 August on what would have been her 14th war patrol. This was cut short by the [[Japanese surrender]] on 15 August. She proceeded to [[Saipan]] at the end of hostilities, and from there sailed for Pearl Harbor, the [[Panama Canal Zone]], and [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]].\n\n===Post-War===\n''Drum'' was decommissioned on 16 February 1946 and on 18 March 1947, began service at [[Washington, D.C.]], to members of the [[United States Navy Reserve|Naval Reserve]] in the [[Potomac River Naval Command]], which continued through 1967. She was in the [[United States Navy reserve fleets|inactive Fleet]] at [[Norfolk, Virginia]] from 1967 to 1969.\n\n==Awards==\n''Drum'' received a total of 12 [[battle star]]s for her [[World War II]] service. She is credited with sinking 15 ships,<ref>http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/Japan/IJN/JANAC-Losses/JANAC-Losses-6.html</ref> a total of 80,580 tons of enemy shipping, eighth highest of all US submarines in total Japanese tonnage sunk.\n\n==Museum ship and landmark==\n\n''Drum'' was donated to the [[USS Alabama (BB-60)#Museum ship|USS ''Alabama'' Battleship Commission]] on 14 April 1969. She was towed to [[Battleship Memorial Park|Battleship Alabama Memorial Park]] in [[Mobile, Alabama]] arriving on 18 May 1969. ''Drum'' was dedicated and opened to the public on 4 July 1969.\n\nThe submarine was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1986.<ref name=\"nhlsum\"/><ref name=\"nrhpinv2\">\n{{cite web\n|url={{NHLS url|id=86000086}}\n|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: USS Drum (SS-228)\n|format=pdf\n|date=May 1985\n|first=Harry A.\n|last=Butowsky\n|publisher=[[National Park Service]]\n|accessdate=2009-06-22\n}} and<br /> {{cite web\n|url={{NHLS url|id=86000086|photos=y}}\n|format=pdf\n|title=Accompanying 4 photos, 1 exterior and 3 interior, from 1985\n|accessdate=2012-08-29\n}}</ref>\n\n''Drum'' was moored in the waters behind ''Alabama'', until she was substantially damaged by the [[storm surge]] of [[Hurricane Georges]] in 1998. As a result, she is now on display on shore. ''Alabama'' and ''Drum'' also sustained damage when [[Hurricane Katrina]] came ashore on 29 August 2005. Tours on board ''Drum'' resumed 9 January 2006. Most funding to maintain the submarine comes from a community of American Submarine Vets.\n\nAs of 2015, the ''Drum'''s restoration has progressed at an extraordinary rate, including the complete rebuilding of part of the bow and stern sections and the installation of new I-beams inside the ballast tanks to support the submarine's overall weight.<ref>http://www.drum228.org/restoration.html</ref>\n<gallery class=\"center\"  widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nImage:USS Drum.jpg|''Drum'' in 1983, prior to her relocation\n\nFile:USS Drum SS-228 Tower.jpeg|''Drum'' Topside\nFile:USS Drum SS-228 Forward Torpedo room.jpeg|''Drum'' Forward Torpedo room\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*The ''Drum'''s Periscope is aimed directly at the stern of the [[USS Alabama (BB-60)|USS ''Alabama'']]\n*[[Wayne Green]], founder of Byte magazine (among others) was a crew member.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of most successful American submarines in World War II]]\n*[[List of National Historic Landmarks in Alabama]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DANFS|http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/d/drum.html}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.ussalabama.com/ Battleship Memorial Park]\n*[http://www.drum228.org/ Drum228.org:  USS ''Drum'' WWII war patrol reports, WWII crew list, historical information, restoration]\n*[http://www.pigboats.com/ww2/drum.html Kill record:  USS ''Drum'']\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090902053125/http://www.ussdrum228story.com/ ''The Untold Story'' USS ''Drum'' (SS-228) documentary]\n{{commons category}}\n*{{hnsa|uss-drum-ss-228}}\n*{{navsource|08/08228|USS Drum}}\n*[http://www.hazegray.org/danfs/submar/ss228.txt hazegray.org: USS ''Drum'']\n\n{{Gato class_submarine}}\n{{Surviving ocean going ships}}\n{{Mobile attractions}}\n{{NRHP in Mobile, Alabama}}\n{{Registered Historic Places}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Drum (Ss-228)}}\n[[Category:1941 ships]]\n[[Category:Gato-class submarines]]\n[[Category:National Historic Landmarks in Alabama]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Mobile, Alabama]]\n[[Category:Ships built in Kittery, Maine]]\n[[Category:Ships on the National Register of Historic Places in Alabama]]\n[[Category:World War II submarines of the United States]]\n[[Category:Museum ships in Alabama]]\n", "text_old": "{{other ships|USS Drum}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2012}}\n\n{|{{Infobox ship begin}}\n|+USS ''Drum'' (SS-228)\n{{Infobox ship image\n|Ship image=[[Image:USS Drum SS-228 in Mobile.jpg|300px|USS ''Drum'' (SS-228) on display as a museum ship]]\n|Ship caption=\n}}\n{{Infobox ship career\n|Hide header=\n|Ship country=United States\n|Ship flag={{USN flag|1946}}\n|Ship name=\n|Ship namesake=[[Sciaenidae|Drum, Fish]]\n|Ship ordered=12 June 1940\n|Ship builder=[[Portsmouth Naval Shipyard]], [[Kittery, Maine]]<ref name=\"FriedmanSubs1-dates\">\n {{cite book\n |last=Friedman\n |first=Norman\n |title=U.S. Submarines Through 1945: An Illustrated Design History\n |publisher=[[United States Naval Institute]]\n |year=1995\n |location=[[Annapolis, Maryland]]\n |pages=285\u2013304\n |isbn=1-55750-263-3\n }}</ref>\n|Ship laid down=11 September 1940<ref name=\"FriedmanSubs1-dates\"/>\n|Ship launched=12 May 1941<ref name=\"FriedmanSubs1-dates\"/>\n|Ship sponsor=Mrs. Thomas Holcomb\n|Ship acquired=\n|Ship commissioned=1 November 1941<ref name=\"FriedmanSubs1-dates\"/>\n|Ship decommissioned=16 February 1946<ref name=\"FriedmanSubs1-dates\"/>\n|Ship in service=\n|Ship out of service=\n|Ship struck=30 June 1968<ref name=\"FriedmanSubs1-dates\"/>\n|Ship reinstated=\n|Ship status=[[Museum ship]] at [[Mobile, Alabama]]<ref name=\"Register\">\n {{cite book\n |last=Bauer\n |first=K.

Patrolling between the [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]] and [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]], she sank the submarine tender ''[[Hie Maru]]'' (11,621 tons) on 17 November, and on 22 November attacked a convoy of four freighters. The convoy's escorts delivered three depth charge attacks. ''Drum'' was heavily damaged and ordered to Pearl Harbor. She arrived there on 5 December; inspection revealed that the [[conning tower]] needed to be replaced, which required that she sail to the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].\n\n===Ninth patrol===\nReturning to Pearl Harbor on 29 March 1944, ''Drum'' sailed 11 days later on her ninth war patrol, during which she patrolled the waters around [[Iwo Jima]] and other islands in the [[Bonin Islands]]. No worthy targets were contacted, but a reconnaissance of [[Chichi Jima]] gained valuable intelligence for bombardment of the island later by surface ships.\n\n===Tenth and Eleventh patrols===\nThe submarine refitted at [[Majuro]] from 31 May{{spaced ndash}}24 June, then sailed on her 10th war patrol to give lifeguard service for raids on [[Yap]] and [[Palau]]. She sank a 125-ton ''[[sampan]]'' on 29 July, capturing two prisoners whom she brought back to Pearl Harbor on 14 August. She sailed for [[Surigao Strait]] on 9 September on her 11th war patrol, and after two weeks in the Strait with no contact, she was ordered north to the [[South China Sea]]. Here she patrolled during the [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]] landings and the decisive [[Battle for Leyte Gulf]], and on 24 October sank the passenger-cargo ship ''Shikisan Maru'' (4725 tons). On 26 October ''Drum'', made contact with a 13 ship convoy (10 merchant with 3 escorts)  sinking two passenger-cargo ships, ''Taihaku Maru'' (6886 tons), ''Taisho Maru'' (6886 tons), and one transport ship, ''Tatsura Maru'', (6420 tons), also damaging another passenger-cargo ship, ''Aoki Maru'' (3710 tons), bound for the [[Philippines]] with Japanese reinforcements. While sailing for Majuro for refit, ''Drum'' searched east of [[Luzon Strait]] for downed aviators.\n\n===Twelfth, Thirteenth and last patrols===\n''Drum'' replenished and made repairs at Majuro from 8 November{{spaced ndash}}7 December, then sailed for the [[Nansei Shoto]] on her 12th war patrol. Only one contact was made during this patrol, and she returned to [[Guam]] on 17 January 1945. During her 13th war patrol, from 11 February{{spaced ndash}}2 April, ''Drum'' played a part in the assaults on both Iwo Jima and [[Okinawa]], providing lifeguard service for air strikes on the Nansei Shoto and the Japanese home islands as bases were neutralized before both invasions. Returning to Pearl Harbor, ''Drum'' sailed to the West Coast for another overhaul, and after training at Pearl Harbor, cleared Midway on 9 August on what would have been her 14th war patrol. This was cut short by the [[Japanese surrender]] on 15 August. She proceeded to [[Saipan]] at the end of hostilities, and from there sailed for Pearl Harbor, the [[Panama Canal Zone]], and [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]].\n\n===Post-War===\n''Drum'' was decommissioned on 16 February 1946 and on 18 March 1947, began service at [[Washington, D.C.]], to members of the [[United States Navy Reserve|Naval Reserve]] in the [[Potomac River Naval Command]], which continued through 1967. She was in the [[United States Navy reserve fleets|inactive Fleet]] at [[Norfolk, Virginia]] from 1967 to 1969.\n\n==Awards==\n''Drum'' received a total of 12 [[battle star]]s for her [[World War II]] service. She is credited with sinking 15 ships,<ref>http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/Japan/IJN/JANAC-Losses/JANAC-Losses-6.html</ref> a total of 80,580 tons of enemy shipping, eighth highest of all US submarines in total Japanese tonnage sunk.\n\n==Museum ship and landmark==\n\n''Drum'' was donated to the [[USS Alabama (BB-60)#Museum ship|USS ''Alabama'' Battleship Commission]] on 14 April 1969. She was towed to [[Battleship Memorial Park|Battleship Alabama Memorial Park]] in [[Mobile, Alabama]] arriving on 18 May 1969. ''Drum'' was dedicated and opened to the public on 4 July 1969.\n\nThe submarine was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1986.<ref name=\"nhlsum\"/><ref name=\"nrhpinv2\">\n{{cite web\n|url={{NHLS url|id=86000086}}\n|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: USS Drum (SS-228)\n|format=pdf\n|date=May 1985\n|first=Harry A.\n|last=Butowsky\n|publisher=[[National Park Service]]\n|accessdate=2009-06-22\n}} and<br /> {{cite web\n|url={{NHLS url|id=86000086|photos=y}}\n|format=pdf\n|title=Accompanying 4 photos, 1 exterior and 3 interior, from 1985\n|accessdate=2012-08-29\n}}</ref>\n\n''Drum'' was moored in the waters behind ''Alabama'', until she was substantially damaged by the [[storm surge]] of [[Hurricane Georges]] in 1998. As a result, she is now on display on shore. ''Alabama'' and ''Drum'' also sustained damage when [[Hurricane Katrina]] came ashore on 29 August 2005. Tours on board ''Drum'' resumed 9 January 2006. Most funding to maintain the submarine comes from a community of American Submarine Vets.\n\nAs of 2015, the ''Drum'''s restoration has progressed at an extraordinary rate, including the complete rebuilding of part of the bow and stern sections and the installation of new I-beams inside the ballast tanks to support the submarine's overall weight.<ref>http://www.drum228.org/restoration.html</ref>\n<gallery class=\"center\"  widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nImage:USS Drum.jpg|''Drum'' in 1983, prior to her relocation\n\nFile:USS Drum SS-228 Tower.jpeg|''Drum'' Topside\nFile:USS Drum SS-228 Forward Torpedo room.jpeg|''Drum'' Forward Torpedo room\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*The ''Drum'''s Periscope is aimed directly at the stern of the [[USS Alabama (BB-60)|USS ''Alabama'']]\n*[[Wayne Green]], founder of Byte magazine (among others) was a crew member.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of most successful American submarines in World War II]]\n*[[List of National Historic Landmarks in Alabama]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DANFS|http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/d/drum.html}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.ussalabama.com/ Battleship Memorial Park]\n*[http://www.drum228.org/ Drum228.org:  USS ''Drum'' WWII war patrol reports, WWII crew list, historical information, restoration]\n*[http://www.pigboats.com/ww2/drum.html Kill record:  USS ''Drum'']\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090902053125/http://www.ussdrum228story.com/ ''The Untold Story'' USS ''Drum'' (SS-228) documentary]\n{{commons category}}\n*{{hnsa|uss-drum-ss-228}}\n*{{navsource|08/08228|USS Drum}}\n*[http://www.hazegray.org/danfs/submar/ss228.txt hazegray.org: USS ''Drum'']\n\n{{Gato class_submarine}}\n{{Surviving ocean going ships}}\n{{Mobile attractions}}\n{{NRHP in Mobile, Alabama}}\n{{Registered Historic Places}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Drum (Ss-228)}}\n[[Category:1941 ships]]\n[[Category:Gato-class submarines]]\n[[Category:National Historic Landmarks in Alabama]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Mobile, Alabama]]\n[[Category:Ships built in Kittery, Maine]]\n[[Category:Ships on the National Register of Historic Places in Alabama]]\n[[Category:World War II submarines of the United States]]\n[[Category:Museum ships in Alabama]]\n", "name_user": "Keith D", "label": "safe", "comment": "Remove comma", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Drum_(SS-228)"}

Mongul first uses it in \"[[For the Man Who Has Everything]]\", a story by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Dave Gibbons]] that was first published in ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]] [[Annual publication|Annual]]'' #11 (1985) and later adapted into the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' [[List of Justice League episodes#Season 1 (2004\u201305)|episode of the same name]] and for one episode of \"[[Supergirl (2015 TV series)|Supergirl]]\" called \"For the Girl Who Has Everything\", where in that episode the plant was sent by Kryptonian [[Non (comics)]]. Described in the original story by Mongul as \"something between a plant and an intelligent fungus\", the Black Mercy attaches itself to its victims in a form of [[symbiosis]], and feeds from the victim's \"[[bio-aura]]\". The organism is telepathic, and reads its victim's heart's desire, giving them a logical simulation and an ending that the victim wants, which the victim experiences an entirely immersive, virtual experience in which their actual surroundings are masked to them. According to Mongul, victims are capable of \"shrugging off\" the hallucination, though some find the experience too compelling too do so unaided.<ref name=ActionAnnual11>[[Moore, Alan]] (w), [[Gibbons, Dave]] (a). \"[[For the Man Who Has Everything]]\", ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]] [[Annual publication|Annual]]'' #11 (1985).

When Mongul first uses the Black Mercy on Superman, they burrow through his costume and into his body, able to penetrate his otherwise invulnerable skin because, Wonder Woman senses, they are at least partially magical, which is one of Superman's weaknesses. During his experience with the organism, Superman's breathing appears faint, and his ability to sense the fraudulent nature of the simulation it feeds him and fight it manifests as tears produced by his actual eyes. The Black Mercy can be pulled off a victim by a strong humanoid such as Batman, and Mongul uses special protective gauntlets to handle the plant safely.<ref name=ActionAnnual11/> Superman is not able to awaken from the Black Mercy's simulation without help from Batman, though [[Oliver Queen]] and [[Hal Jordan]] are both able to do so in a subsequent storyline when they are both trapped by the same plant, as this meant that the two were sharing an illusion and Hal's strength of will caused Oliver to experience what ''Hal'' believed was his friend's greatest desire rather than Oliver making the choice himself.<ref name=APerfectLife>[[Johns, Geoff]] (w), [[Pacheco, Carlos]] (p), Merino, Jesus (i). \"A Perfect Life: Chapters 1-2\", ''[[Green Lantern]]'' (Vol. 4) #7-8 (February\u2013March 2006).

Gravity is weaker in Pandora, thereby giving rise to gigantism. There is a strong magnetic field, causing plants to develop 'magnetotropism'. A particularly intriguing quality of flora and fauna in Pandora is their ability to communicate with each other. This is explained in the movie as a phenomenon called 'signal transduction', pertaining to how plants perceive a signal and respond to it.\n\n===In video games===\nVideo games frequently feature fictional plants as items that can be collected by the player, or occasionally appear as non-player characters. \n\n* The [[Monster Hunter]] series has multiple fictional flowers and plants that can be gathered by the player character, including nulberries, might seeds, flowferns, and dragonstrike nuts.\n*'''Sunflower''' from the [[Plants vs Zombies]] series it's a flower which is used to collect sunlight for you, a point which is extremely useful to place other defensive plants.\n* The [[Legend of Zelda]] series, plants play a significant role.

Mongul first uses it in \"[[For the Man Who Has Everything]]\", a story by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Dave Gibbons]] that was first published in ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]] [[Annual publication|Annual]]'' #11 (1985) and later adapted into the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' [[List of Justice League episodes#Season 1 (2004\u201305)|episode of the same name]] and for one episode of \"[[Supergirl (2015 TV series)|Supergirl]]\" called \"For the Girl Who Has Everything\", where in that episode the plant was sent by Kryptonian [[Non (comics)]]. Described in the original story by Mongul as \"something between a plant and an intelligent fungus\", the Black Mercy attaches itself to its victims in a form of [[symbiosis]], and feeds from the victim's \"[[bio-aura]]\". The organism is telepathic, and reads its victim's heart's desire, giving them a logical simulation and an ending that the victim wants, which the victim experiences an entirely immersive, virtual experience in which their actual surroundings are masked to them. According to Mongul, victims are capable of \"shrugging off\" the hallucination, though some find the experience too compelling too do so unaided.<ref name=ActionAnnual11>[[Moore, Alan]] (w), [[Gibbons, Dave]] (a). \"[[For the Man Who Has Everything]]\", ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]] [[Annual publication|Annual]]'' #11 (1985). [[DC Comics]].</ref>\n\nThe Black Mercy is typically depicted as consisting of dark green, thorned vines that attach themselves to a humanoid victim's upper torso, with a set of pink flowers, each with a long, red, tentacle-like [[Stigma (botany)|stigma]], growing in the center of the victim's chest. When Mongul first uses the Black Mercy on Superman, they burrow through his costume and into his body, able to penetrate his otherwise invulnerable skin because, Wonder Woman senses, they are at least partially magical, which is one of Superman's weaknesses. During his experience with the organism, Superman's breathing appears faint, and his ability to sense the fraudulent nature of the simulation it feeds him and fight it manifests as tears produced by his actual eyes. The Black Mercy can be pulled off a victim by a strong humanoid such as Batman, and Mongul uses special protective gauntlets to handle the plant safely.<ref name=ActionAnnual11/> Superman is not able to awaken from the Black Mercy's simulation without help from Batman, though [[Oliver Queen]] and [[Hal Jordan]] are both able to do so in a subsequent storyline when they are both trapped by the same plant, as this meant that the two were sharing an illusion and Hal's strength of will caused Oliver to experience what ''Hal'' believed was his friend's greatest desire rather than Oliver making the choice himself.<ref name=APerfectLife>[[Johns, Geoff]] (w), [[Pacheco, Carlos]] (p), Merino, Jesus (i). \"A Perfect Life: Chapters 1-2\", ''[[Green Lantern]]'' (Vol. 4) #7-8 (February\u2013March 2006). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nIn the video game, ''[[Injustice 2]]'' Supergirl mentions Black Mercy in pre-battle dialogue with Scarecrow. She states dealing with him is no different than dealing with Black Mercy, causing Scarecrow to ask her what is Black Mercy out of curiosity, causing Supergirl to describe it as an evil space plant.\n\nCharacters who have experienced the Black Mercy include:\n*'''Superman''' sees himself on a still-intact Krypton with his biological parents, married to a retired actress named Lyla, and a son named Van.<ref name=ActionAnnual11/> \n*'''Batman''' envisions a life in which his parents were not murdered during his childhood, and he is married to [[Kathy Kane]].<ref name=ActionAnnual11/>\n*'''Mongul''' envisions a life in which he successfully kills Superman, before setting out across the universe, killing all of his enemies, entire populations kneeling before him amid his destruction of countless galaxies.<ref name=ActionAnnual11/><ref>[[Jurgens, Dan]] (w), [[Zircher, Patrick]] (a). \"Revenge, Part I\".

When Mongul uses the Black Mercy on him, Green Arrow was caught along with Hal Jordan, with the result that he saw what Hal believed would be his perfect life.<ref name=APerfectLife/>\n*'''Hal Jordan''' envisions a life in which his parents and his siblings are present in his life, and Sinestro is a friend who fights by his side as a member of the [[Green Lantern Corps]]. When Mongul uses the Black Mercy on him, Jordan was caught in the same illusion as Oliver Queen, which resulted in Jordan creating what ''he'' believed would be Queen's perfect life rather than Queen experiencing his own idea of a perfect life, allowing Queen to see through its simulation and thus awaken from it.<ref name=APerfectLife/>\n\n==In mythology==\n* '''[[Aglaophotis]]''': A type of Peony said to be magical\n*'''[[Austras koks]]''': a tree which grows from the start of the Sun's daily journey across the sky in [[Latvian mythology]]\n* '''Barnacle tree''': mythical tree believed in the [[Middle Ages]] to have barnacles that opened to reveal [[Barnacle goose|geese]].

After the Griffins get their car back, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] is taken to court as a representative of the Pawtucket Patriot brewery, his employer, when it is discovered that its ale is an unauthorized copy of [[Duff Beer]].\n\nThe idea for a crossover episode was suggested by ''Family Guy'' executive producer and former ''Simpsons'' writer [[Richard Appel]], and the episode was announced by Fox in July 2013. Five of the six main members of the voice cast of ''The Simpsons''\u2014the exception being [[Harry Shearer]]\u2014voiced their characters in the episode. \"The Simpsons Guy\" was met with a mixed reception by critics, who had differing opinions on how well the two shows combined.\n\n==Plot==\nWhen Peter gets annoyed by an unfunny comic strip from the Quahog newspaper, he decides to draw his own. His art is a hit at first, but it angers local women for its misogynistic humor and the Internet turns against him. He tries to clear his name on Joyce Kinney's show which backfires. Faced with an angry mob at the door, the [[Griffin family]] decides to flee for their safety until things blow over. Peter drives the family out of Quahog to escape the townspeople's ire. When they stop at a gas station, their car is stolen, leaving them stranded outside [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]. At the [[Kwik-E-Mart]], [[Homer Simpson]] introduces himself to the Griffins and takes them to the Springfield Police Department, where they are turned away by [[Chief Wiggum]].\n\nThe [[Simpson family]] puts up the [[Griffin family]] in their [[The Simpsons house|home]] until things improve. [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] shows [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] his [[slingshot]], and teaches him how to skateboard, and they become good friends. When [[Nelson Muntz]] bullies Bart, Stewie retaliates by kidnapping and torturing Nelson. Meanwhile, [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] tries to find a talent that [[Meg Griffin|Meg]] has. When she finds that Meg is a natural at the [[saxophone]], she downplays the talent out of jealousy. [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] and [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] take the Simpsons' dog, [[Santa's Little Helper]], for a walk. Brian tries to teach Santa's Little Helper independence, but the latter runs off when freed. [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] notices Santa's Little Helper is missing, and Chris and Brian fake his presence until he eventually returns. Homer and Peter try different plans to find Peter's car, each one backfiring, until they discover it in the possession of [[Hans Moleman]] when he accidentally runs Peter over.\n\nThe men celebrate at [[Moe Szyslak|Moe's Tavern]], but relationships sour when Peter tries to introduce Homer to Pawtucket Patriot ale. The drink is revealed to be an imitation of [[Duff Beer]] with a new label. This results in Duff, represented by the [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Blue Haired Lawyer|Blue Haired Lawyer]], filing a lawsuit against Pawtucket Brewery for [[patent infringement]], with Peter forced to defend the brewery to save [[Family Guy#Setting|Quahog]]. [[Fred Flintstone]] is the [[judge]] who presides over the case. During the trial, similar characters from both shows interact with each other including both shows' versions of [[James Woods]]. Fred rules in favor of Duff Beer, but declares that both Pawtucket Patriot Ale and Duff Beer are imitations of his own favorite beer [[Budweiser|Bud Rock]].\n\nThe Griffins prepare to return to Quahog, where Peter faces the prospect of finding a new job. Lisa gives Meg her saxophone, but Peter throws it away, claiming there is no room for any more luggage. Stewie points out that he took revenge on not just Nelson, but all of Bart's enemies: Nelson, [[Jimbo Jones]], [[Principal Skinner]], [[Sideshow Bob]], and (for the sake of making a scatological pun) [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon|Apu]]. Bart is sickened by Stewie's violent tendencies and ends their friendship. Homer tries to explain his actions, but Peter reacts angrily and the two fight (\u00e0 la fighting between Peter and [[List of Family Guy characters#The Giant Chicken|The Giant Chicken]]) through Springfield. The pair gain superpowers when they hit the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]], then end up in [[Kang and Kodos]]' spaceship, where they lose their powers before landing in Springfield Gorge. Peter and Homer stop fighting and admit their respect and admiration for each other while agreeing to stay away in the future. Returning home, the Griffins find that the heat from Peter's comic has died down and the Pawtucket Brewery is safe when Lois doubts that the inhabitants of Springfield will visit Quahog to enforce the ruling. Stewie tries to pretend that he is over Bart, but goes to his room crying while writing \"I will not think about Bart anymore\" [[The Simpsons opening sequence|several times on a chalkboard]].\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[File:Simpsons voice actors.jpg|thumb|Five of the six main voice actors from ''[[The Simpsons]]'' reprised their roles in this episode. From left to right: [[Nancy Cartwright]], [[Yeardley Smith]], [[Dan Castellaneta]] and [[Julie Kavner]].

Executive producer [[Richard Appel]] received ''Family Guy'' creator [[Seth MacFarlane]]'s approval and input after brainstorming ideas. Appel then asked for permission from ''Simpsons'' executive producers [[Matt Groening]], [[James L. Brooks]] and [[Al Jean]] to use their characters. This was approved; Appel was previously a writer-producer on ''The Simpsons'' for four seasons, and retained his former colleagues' trust.<ref name=\"EWSimpsonsGuy\"/> [[Dan Castellaneta]], [[Julie Kavner]], [[Nancy Cartwright]], [[Yeardley Smith]] and [[Hank Azaria]] guest star as their ''Simpsons'' characters, but [[Harry Shearer]], the final main cast member of ''The Simpsons'', was unavailable.

MacFarlane said that Fox would be happy to make it an hour long. Supervising director [[Peter Shin]], a former layout artist on ''The Simpsons'', spent time adjusting the Griffins to the specifications of Springfield\u2014changes included dimming the whites of their eyeballs so they would not look too bright\u2014and animating the eight-minute fight between Peter and Homer. Appel said there are no plans to do a sequel to the episode, but stated that \"by season 43 of ''The Simpsons'' and season 27 of ''Family Guy'', someone who's looking at a blank board is going to say, 'Well, the Griffins went to Springfield... what if the Simpsons went to Quahog?'

It is a 44-minute-long [[fictional crossover|crossover]] with ''[[The Simpsons]]'', and was written by Patrick Meighan and directed by [[Peter Shin]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Coleman |first=Miriam |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/videos/take-an-early-peek-at-the-simpsons-family-guy-crossover-episode-20140727 |title=Take an Early Peek at the 'Simpsons'-'Family Guy' Crossover Episode |work=Rolling Stone |date=2014-07-27 |accessdate=2014-08-20}}</ref> It originally aired in the United States on September 28, 2014, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], where both ''The Simpsons'' and ''Family Guy'' have aired since their respective debuts.\n\nIn the episode, [[Griffin family|the Griffins]] meet [[Simpson family|the Simpsons]] for the first time and decide to stay with them after the Griffin family's car is stolen just outside [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]. After the Griffins get their car back, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] is taken to court as a representative of the Pawtucket Patriot brewery, his employer, when it is discovered that its ale is an unauthorized copy of [[Duff Beer]].\n\nThe idea for a crossover episode was suggested by ''Family Guy'' executive producer and former ''Simpsons'' writer [[Richard Appel]], and the episode was announced by Fox in July 2013. Five of the six main members of the voice cast of ''The Simpsons''\u2014the exception being [[Harry Shearer]]\u2014voiced their characters in the episode. \"The Simpsons Guy\" was met with a mixed reception by critics, who had differing opinions on how well the two shows combined.\n\n==Plot==\nWhen Peter gets annoyed by an unfunny comic strip from the Quahog newspaper, he decides to draw his own. His art is a hit at first, but it angers local women for its misogynistic humor and the Internet turns against him. He tries to clear his name on Joyce Kinney's show which backfires. Faced with an angry mob at the door, the [[Griffin family]] decides to flee for their safety until things blow over. Peter drives the family out of Quahog to escape the townspeople's ire. When they stop at a gas station, their car is stolen, leaving them stranded outside [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]. At the [[Kwik-E-Mart]], [[Homer Simpson]] introduces himself to the Griffins and takes them to the Springfield Police Department, where they are turned away by [[Chief Wiggum]].\n\nThe [[Simpson family]] puts up the [[Griffin family]] in their [[The Simpsons house|home]] until things improve. [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] shows [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] his [[slingshot]], and teaches him how to skateboard, and they become good friends. When [[Nelson Muntz]] bullies Bart, Stewie retaliates by kidnapping and torturing Nelson. Meanwhile, [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] tries to find a talent that [[Meg Griffin|Meg]] has. When she finds that Meg is a natural at the [[saxophone]], she downplays the talent out of jealousy. [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] and [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] take the Simpsons' dog, [[Santa's Little Helper]], for a walk. Brian tries to teach Santa's Little Helper independence, but the latter runs off when freed. [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] notices Santa's Little Helper is missing, and Chris and Brian fake his presence until he eventually returns. Homer and Peter try different plans to find Peter's car, each one backfiring, until they discover it in the possession of [[Hans Moleman]] when he accidentally runs Peter over.\n\nThe men celebrate at [[Moe Szyslak|Moe's Tavern]], but relationships sour when Peter tries to introduce Homer to Pawtucket Patriot ale. The drink is revealed to be an imitation of [[Duff Beer]] with a new label. This results in Duff, represented by the [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Blue Haired Lawyer|Blue Haired Lawyer]], filing a lawsuit against Pawtucket Brewery for [[patent infringement]], with Peter forced to defend the brewery to save [[Family Guy#Setting|Quahog]]. [[Fred Flintstone]] is the [[judge]] who presides over the case. During the trial, similar characters from both shows interact with each other including both shows' versions of [[James Woods]]. Fred rules in favor of Duff Beer, but declares that both Pawtucket Patriot Ale and Duff Beer are imitations of his own favorite beer [[Budweiser|Bud Rock]].\n\nThe Griffins prepare to return to Quahog, where Peter faces the prospect of finding a new job. Lisa gives Meg her saxophone, but Peter throws it away, claiming there is no room for any more luggage. Stewie points out that he took revenge on not just Nelson, but all of Bart's enemies: Nelson, [[Jimbo Jones]], [[Principal Skinner]], [[Sideshow Bob]], and (for the sake of making a scatological pun) [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon|Apu]]. Bart is sickened by Stewie's violent tendencies and ends their friendship. Homer tries to explain his actions, but Peter reacts angrily and the two fight (\u00e0 la fighting between Peter and [[List of Family Guy characters#The Giant Chicken|The Giant Chicken]]) through Springfield. The pair gain superpowers when they hit the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]], then end up in [[Kang and Kodos]]' spaceship, where they lose their powers before landing in Springfield Gorge. Peter and Homer stop fighting and admit their respect and admiration for each other while agreeing to stay away in the future. Returning home, the Griffins find that the heat from Peter's comic has died down and the Pawtucket Brewery is safe when Lois doubts that the inhabitants of Springfield will visit Quahog to enforce the ruling. Stewie tries to pretend that he is over Bart, but goes to his room crying while writing \"I will not think about Bart anymore\" [[The Simpsons opening sequence|several times on a chalkboard]].\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[File:Simpsons voice actors.jpg|thumb|Five of the six main voice actors from ''[[The Simpsons]]'' reprised their roles in this episode. From left to right: [[Nancy Cartwright]], [[Yeardley Smith]], [[Dan Castellaneta]] and [[Julie Kavner]]. [[Hank Azaria]] is not pictured.]]\nThe idea of a crossover with ''The Simpsons'' was first suggested while the thirteenth season of ''Family Guy'' was being planned out. Executive producer [[Richard Appel]] received ''Family Guy'' creator [[Seth MacFarlane]]'s approval and input after brainstorming ideas. Appel then asked for permission from ''Simpsons'' executive producers [[Matt Groening]], [[James L. Brooks]] and [[Al Jean]] to use their characters. This was approved; Appel was previously a writer-producer on ''The Simpsons'' for four seasons, and retained his former colleagues' trust.<ref name=\"EWSimpsonsGuy\"/> [[Dan Castellaneta]], [[Julie Kavner]], [[Nancy Cartwright]], [[Yeardley Smith]] and [[Hank Azaria]] guest star as their ''Simpsons'' characters, but [[Harry Shearer]], the final main cast member of ''The Simpsons'', was unavailable. Asked how he felt about the crossover, Shearer replied, \"Matter and anti-matter.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/08/08/harry_shearer_on_revolutionizing_comedy_and_why_nixon_was_the_last_great_character_of_our_time/|title=Legendary comic Harry Shearer: Nixon was the last great tragicomic character of our time|last=Gupta|first=Prachi|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date=August 8, 2014|accessdate=March 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\n''Family Guy'' writers pitched several storylines for the crossover, including one in which the Griffins stay with [[Lenny and Carl]] and never meet the Simpsons, and another one in which their whole series is revealed to be a figment of [[Ralph Wiggum]]'s imagination.<ref name=\"EWSimpsonsGuy\"/> When the final script was read to the show's staff, Appel expressed his concern about the length of the episode. MacFarlane said that Fox would be happy to make it an hour long. Supervising director [[Peter Shin]], a former layout artist on ''The Simpsons'', spent time adjusting the Griffins to the specifications of Springfield\u2014changes included dimming the whites of their eyeballs so they would not look too bright\u2014and animating the eight-minute fight between Peter and Homer. Appel said there are no plans to do a sequel to the episode, but stated that \"by season 43 of ''The Simpsons'' and season 27 of ''Family Guy'', someone who's looking at a blank board is going to say, 'Well, the Griffins went to Springfield... what if the Simpsons went to Quahog?'

People want to see Peter interact with Homer. They want to see Bart interact with Stewie. In a way, the story in a crossover episode, while it has to be there, is never quite as important as how the characters interact with each other.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/09/03/this-weeks-cover-inside-the-simpsons-family-guy-crossover/|title=This week's cover: Inside the 'Simpsons'-'Family Guy' crossover|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=7 October 2014}}</ref> ''The Simpsons'' creator Groening added, \"In this case, it's two really vivid shows and seeing what they can do together.

In it, after Bart's [[prank call]] to Moe asking for a man with an innuendo name, Stewie makes his own call and tells Moe that his sister is being [[rape]]d.

He is the lead guitarist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. His songs include \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]]\", \"[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" and \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\".\n\nMay was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], having previously performed with Taylor in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]], which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player [[John Deacon]] completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and its single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the [[Red Special]].<ref name=redspecial>{{cite book |last1=May|first1=Brian |authorlink1= Brian May|last2=Bradley |first2=Simon |title=Brian May's Red Special  |date=2014 |publisher=Prion Books |isbn=978-1-78097-276-3 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|1992 tribute concert]], the release of ''[[Made in Heaven]]'' (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, \"[[No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)]]\" (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists.

An earlier version of the band had been loosely formed for 19&nbsp;October 1991, when May took part in the Guitar Legends guitar festival in [[Seville]], Spain. The line-up for his performance was May on vocals and lead guitar, [[Cozy Powell]] on drums and percussion, [[Mike Moran (music producer)|Mike Moran]] and [[Rick Wakeman]] on keyboards, and [[Maggie Ryder]], [[Miriam Stockley]] and [[Chris Thompson (English musician)|Chris Thompson]] on backing vocals.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://jazzbluesrock.online/2018/12/guitar-legends-expo-92-sevilla/ |title=Guitar Legends \u2013 Expo \u201992 Sevilla |website=jazzbluesrock.online |url-status=live |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref> The original line-up was May on vocals and lead guitar, Powell on drums and percussion, [[Michael Casswell]] on guitar, [[Neil Murray (British musician)|Neil Murray]] on bass, and Ryder, Stockley and Thompson on backing vocals.

May brought guitarist [[Jamie Moses]] on board to replace Mike Caswell. The backing vocalists, Ryder, Stockley and Thompson, were replaced by [[Catherine Porter]] and [[Shelley Preston]]. On 23&nbsp;February 1993, this new line-up of The Brian May Band began its world tour in the US, both supporting [[Guns N' Roses]] and headlining a few dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/live/brian.htm#1993bttlnorthamerica1|title=1993 Back To The Light North American Tour (1st leg)|publisher=Ultimatequeen.co.uk|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref> The tour included dates in North America, Europe (support act: Valentine) and Japan.

May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and on new material. The songs included ''[[Another World (Brian May album)|Another World]]'', and featured mainly [[Spike Edney]], Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5&nbsp;April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the [[M4 motorway]] near [[Bristol]], England. This caused huge unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for The Brian May Band which now needed a new drummer on short notice. [[Steve Ferrone]] was brought on to help May finish recording the drum tracks and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, [[Eric Singer]] replaced him on the full 1998 world tour.\n\nThe 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway.  Conway (Brian May in a wig and colourful suit playing the part of a [[teddy boy]] crooner) would play a number of 1950s [[rock and roll]] standards prior to May's 'arrival'.  A bonus T. E. Conway EP entitled ''Retro Rock Special'' was attached to some pressings of the ''Another World'' album.

Examples are found in Queen's albums ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''A Day at the Races'', where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"[[Teo Torriatte]]\").\n\nMay explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including: [[sweep picking]] (\"[[Was It All Worth It]]\" \"Chinese Torture\"); [[tremolo]] (\"Brighton Rock\", \"[[Stone Cold Crazy]]\", \"[[Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)|Death on Two Legs]]\", \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Get Down Make Love]]\", \"[[Dragon Attack]]\"); [[tapping]] (\"[[Bijou (Queen song)|Bijou]]\", \"[[It's Late]]\", \"[[Resurrection]]\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"); slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"); [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] sounding licks (\"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", \"Brighton Rock\"); tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\"); and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by [[Freddie Mercury]], who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from ''[[Queen II]]''),  \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" and the [[skiffle]]-influenced \"'39\" (both from ''A Night at the Opera'').\n\nAided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"[[Queen II#Procession|Procession]]\"; in \"[[Get Down, Make Love]]\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"Good Company\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.<ref>Cunningham, Mark (October 1995).

On a couple of videos, he also used some different electric guitars: a Stratocaster copy on \"Play the Game\" (1980) and a [[Washburn RR-V Tour Series|Washburn RR2V]] on \"Princes of the Universe\" (1986).\n\nIn 1984, [[Guild Guitar Company|Guild]] released the first official Red Special replica for mass production, and made some prototypes specifically for May. However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300&nbsp;guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000&nbsp;copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. At the moment, he uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer\u2014the luthier who restored the Old Lady in 1998\u2014as back-up. They are almost identical to the original, except for the Fryer logo on the headstock (May's original one has a sixpence).\n\n====Amplifiers and effects====\n[[File:VOX AC30 Twin.jpg|thumb|The [[Vox AC30]] amplifier]]\n{{Quote box\n | quote  = I've never heard a guitar sound so loud!

He always used a [[treble booster]] which, along with the AC30 and his custom '[[Deacy Amp]]' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|title=The Legendary Deacy Amp|publisher=queenwillrockyou.weebly.com}}</ref> He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]''. Effects designer [[Pete Cornish]] built for him the TB-83 (32&nbsp;dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.\n\nWhen performing live, May uses banks of Vox&nbsp;AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, [[flanger]] and chorus. He has a rack of 14&nbsp;AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay&nbsp;1, Delay&nbsp;2. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a [[Boss Corporation|BOSS]] pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"[[Sheer Heart Attack|In The Lap of The Gods]]\" (''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'') or \"Hammer to Fall\" (slow version played live with P.&nbsp;Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\".\n\n====Piano and other instruments====\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band's primary pianist, May would step in occasionally (such as on \"Save Me\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUyPyTn-IS4 |title=Queen Save Me (Live) |website=youtube.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> and \"Flash\").<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sheetmusic-free.com/flash-theme-sheet-music-queen/ |title=Flash Theme Sheet Music Queen |website=sheetmusic-free.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> He mostly used Freddie Mercury's 1972 Steinway piano.

He used a \"genuine [[George Formby]] Ukulele-Banjo\" in \"[[Bring Back That Leroy Brown]]\" and [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"Good Company\"]]. Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album). May was keen on using some toys as instruments as well.

From Queen's ''[[Queen II]]'' to ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'', May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with [[Lee Holdridge]], ''Il Colosso'', for [[Steve Barron]]'s 1996 film, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.  May performed the opera with [[Jerry Hadley]], [[Sissel Kyrkjebo]], and [[Just William]].

Harold May''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|CBE}} (born 19 July 1947) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and astrophysicist. He is the lead guitarist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. His songs include \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]]\", \"[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" and \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\".\n\nMay was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], having previously performed with Taylor in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]], which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player [[John Deacon]] completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and its single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the [[Red Special]].<ref name=redspecial>{{cite book |last1=May|first1=Brian |authorlink1= Brian May|last2=Bradley |first2=Simon |title=Brian May's Red Special  |date=2014 |publisher=Prion Books |isbn=978-1-78097-276-3 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|1992 tribute concert]], the release of ''[[Made in Heaven]]'' (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, \"[[No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)]]\" (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists.

An earlier version of the band had been loosely formed for 19&nbsp;October 1991, when May took part in the Guitar Legends guitar festival in [[Seville]], Spain. The line-up for his performance was May on vocals and lead guitar, [[Cozy Powell]] on drums and percussion, [[Mike Moran (music producer)|Mike Moran]] and [[Rick Wakeman]] on keyboards, and [[Maggie Ryder]], [[Miriam Stockley]] and [[Chris Thompson (English musician)|Chris Thompson]] on backing vocals.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://jazzbluesrock.online/2018/12/guitar-legends-expo-92-sevilla/ |title=Guitar Legends \u2013 Expo \u201992 Sevilla |website=jazzbluesrock.online |url-status=live |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref> The original line-up was May on vocals and lead guitar, Powell on drums and percussion, [[Michael Casswell]] on guitar, [[Neil Murray (British musician)|Neil Murray]] on bass, and Ryder, Stockley and Thompson on backing vocals.

May brought guitarist [[Jamie Moses]] on board to replace Mike Caswell. The backing vocalists, Ryder, Stockley and Thompson, were replaced by [[Catherine Porter]] and [[Shelley Preston]]. On 23&nbsp;February 1993, this new line-up of The Brian May Band began its world tour in the US, both supporting [[Guns N' Roses]] and headlining a few dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/live/brian.htm#1993bttlnorthamerica1|title=1993 Back To The Light North American Tour (1st leg)|publisher=Ultimatequeen.co.uk|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref> The tour included dates in North America, Europe (support act: Valentine) and Japan.

May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and on new material. The songs included ''[[Another World (Brian May album)|Another World]]'', and featured mainly [[Spike Edney]], Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5&nbsp;April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the [[M4 motorway]] near [[Bristol]], England. This caused huge unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for The Brian May Band which now needed a new drummer on short notice. [[Steve Ferrone]] was brought on to help May finish recording the drum tracks and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, [[Eric Singer]] replaced him on the full 1998 world tour.\n\nThe 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway.  Conway (Brian May in a wig and colourful suit playing the part of a [[teddy boy]] crooner) would play a number of 1950s [[rock and roll]] standards prior to May's 'arrival'.  A bonus T. E. Conway EP entitled ''Retro Rock Special'' was attached to some pressings of the ''Another World'' album.

Examples are found in Queen's albums ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''A Day at the Races'', where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"[[Teo Torriatte]]\").\n\nMay explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including: [[sweep picking]] (\"[[Was It All Worth It]]\" \"Chinese Torture\"); [[tremolo]] (\"Brighton Rock\", \"[[Stone Cold Crazy]]\", \"[[Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)|Death on Two Legs]]\", \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Get Down Make Love]]\", \"[[Dragon Attack]]\"); [[tapping]] (\"[[Bijou (Queen song)|Bijou]]\", \"[[It's Late]]\", \"[[Resurrection]]\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"); slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"); [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] sounding licks (\"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", \"Brighton Rock\"); tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\"); and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by [[Freddie Mercury]], who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from ''[[Queen II]]''),  \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" and the [[skiffle]]-influenced \"'39\" (both from ''A Night at the Opera'').\n\nAided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"[[Queen II#Procession|Procession]]\"; in \"[[Get Down, Make Love]]\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"Good Company\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.<ref>Cunningham, Mark (October 1995).

On a couple of videos, he also used some different electric guitars: a Stratocaster copy on \"Play the Game\" (1980) and a [[Washburn RR-V Tour Series|Washburn RR2V]] on \"Princes of the Universe\" (1986).\n\nIn 1984, [[Guild Guitar Company|Guild]] released the first official Red Special replica for mass production, and made some prototypes specifically for May. However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300&nbsp;guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000&nbsp;copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. At the moment, he uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer\u2014the luthier who restored the Old Lady in 1998\u2014as back-up. They are almost identical to the original, except for the Fryer logo on the headstock (May's original one has a sixpence).\n\n====Amplifiers and effects====\n[[File:VOX AC30 Twin.jpg|thumb|The [[Vox AC30]] amplifier]]\n{{Quote box\n | quote  = I've never heard a guitar sound so loud!

He always used a [[treble booster]] which, along with the AC30 and his custom '[[Deacy Amp]]' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|title=The Legendary Deacy Amp|publisher=queenwillrockyou.weebly.com}}</ref> He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]''. Effects designer [[Pete Cornish]] built for him the TB-83 (32&nbsp;dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.\n\nWhen performing live, May uses banks of Vox&nbsp;AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, [[flanger]] and chorus. He has a rack of 14&nbsp;AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay&nbsp;1, Delay&nbsp;2. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a [[Boss Corporation|BOSS]] pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"[[Sheer Heart Attack|In The Lap of The Gods]]\" (''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'') or \"Hammer to Fall\" (slow version played live with P.&nbsp;Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\".\n\n====Piano and other instruments====\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band's primary pianist, May would step in occasionally (such as on \"Save Me\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUyPyTn-IS4 |title=Queen Save Me (Live) |website=youtube.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> and \"Flash\").<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sheetmusic-free.com/flash-theme-sheet-music-queen/ |title=Flash Theme Sheet Music Queen |website=sheetmusic-free.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> He mostly used Freddie Mercury's 1972 Steinway piano.

He used a \"genuine [[George Formby]] Ukulele-Banjo\" in \"[[Bring Back That Leroy Brown]]\" and [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"Good Company\"]]. Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album). May was keen on using some toys as instruments as well.

From Queen's ''[[Queen II]]'' to ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'', May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with [[Lee Holdridge]], ''Il Colosso'', for [[Steve Barron]]'s 1996 film, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.  May performed the opera with [[Jerry Hadley]], [[Sissel Kyrkjebo]], and [[Just William]].

To the north and northwest, the country is [[China\u2013North Korea border|bordered by China]] and [[North Korea\u2013Russia border|by Russia]] along the [[Amnok]] (known as the Yalu in [[Chinese language|Chinese]]) and [[Tumen River|Tumen]] rivers, and to the south, it is bordered by [[South Korea]], with the heavily fortified [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] (DMZ) separating the two. Nevertheless, North Korea, like its southern counterpart, claims to be the legitimate government of the entire peninsula and adjacent islands.\n\nIn 1910, [[Korean Empire|Korea]] was [[Korea under Japanese rule|annexed]] by [[Imperial Japan]]. At the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] at the [[End of World War II in Asia|end of World War II]] in 1945, Korea was [[Division of Korea|divided into two zones]], with the [[Soviet Civil Administration|north occupied by the Soviet Union]] and the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea|south occupied by the United States]]. Negotiations on [[Korean reunification|reunification]] failed, and in 1948, separate governments were formed: the socialist Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the north, and the capitalist [[First Republic of Korea|Republic of Korea]] in the south. An invasion initiated by North Korea led to the [[Korean War]] (1950\u20131953). The [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] brought about a ceasefire, but no peace treaty was signed.\n\nNorth Korea officially describes itself as a \"self-reliant\" [[socialist state]], and formally [[Elections in North Korea|holds elections]], though they have been described by outside observers as [[sham election]]s. Outside observers also generally view North Korea as a [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] [[dictatorship]], particularly noting the elaborate [[North Korean cult of personality|cult of personality]] around the [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim dynasty]]. The [[Workers' Party of Korea]] (WPK), led by a member of the ruling family, holds absolute power in the state and leads the [[Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland]] of which all political officers are required to be members. ''[[Juche]]'', an ideology of national self-reliance, was introduced into [[Constitution of North Korea|the constitution]] in 1972. The [[means of production]] are owned by the state through [[state-run enterprise]]s and [[Collective farming|collectivized farms]]. Most service\u2014such as healthcare, education, housing and food production\u2014are subsidized or state-funded. From 1994 to 1998, North Korea suffered [[North Korean famine|a famine]] that resulted in the deaths of between 240,000 and 420,000 people, and the population continues to suffer malnutrition. North Korea follows ''[[Songun]]'', or \"military-first\" policy. It is the [[List of countries by number of troops|country with the highest number of military and paramilitary personnel]], with a total of 9,495,000 active, reserve and paramilitary personnel, or approximately {{Percentage|9495000|{{UN_Population|Dem. People's Republic of Korea}}}} of its population. Its active duty army of 1.21 million is the fourth largest in the world, after China, the [[United States]] and [[India]]; consisting of {{Percentage|1210000|{{UN_Population|Dem. People's Republic of Korea}}|1}} of its population. It [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|possesses nuclear weapons]]. In addition to being a member of the [[United Nations]] since 1991, North Korea is also a member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], [[Group of 77|G77]] and the [[ASEAN Regional Forum]].\n\nA 2014 UN inquiry into [[human rights in North Korea]] concluded that \"the gravity, scale and nature of these violations reveal a state that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world\". The North Korean regime denies these allegations.\n\n== Etymology ==\n{{See also|Names of Korea}}\nThe name ''Korea'' derives from the name ''Goryeo'' (also spelled ''Kory\u014f''). The name ''Goryeo'' itself was first used by the ancient kingdom of [[Goguryeo]] (Kogury\u014f) which was one of the great powers in [[East Asia]] during its time,<ref>{{cite

Negotiations on [[Korean reunification|reunification]] failed.

In September 1946, South Korean citizens rose up against the Allied Military Government. In April 1948, an [[Jeju Uprising|uprising of the Jeju islanders]] was violently crushed.

Extensive Soviet and Chinese support allowed North Korea to rapidly recover from the Korean War and register very high growth rates. Systematic inefficiency began to arise around 1960, when the economy shifted from the [[extensive growth|extensive]] to the [[intensive growth|intensive development]] stage. The shortage of skilled labor, energy, arable land and transportation significantly impeded long-term growth and resulted in consistent failure to meet planning objectives.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p = 138}} The major slowdown of the economy contrasted with South Korea, which surpassed the North in terms of absolute [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] and per capita income by the 1980s.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p = 142}} North Korea declared the last seven-year plan unsuccessful in December 1993 and thereafter stopped announcing plans.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p = 140}}\n\n[[File:Industry Hamhung, North Korea.jpg|thumb|An industrial plant in [[Hamhung]]]]\n\nThe loss of [[Eastern Bloc]] trading partners and a series of natural disasters throughout the 1990s caused severe hardships, including widespread [[famine]].

To the north and northwest, the country is [[China\u2013North Korea border|bordered by China]] and [[North Korea\u2013Russia border|by Russia]] along the [[Amnok]] (known as the Yalu in [[Chinese language|Chinese]]) and [[Tumen River|Tumen]] rivers, and to the south, it is bordered by [[South Korea]], with the heavily fortified [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] (DMZ) separating the two. Nevertheless, North Korea, like its southern counterpart, claims to be the legitimate government of the entire peninsula and adjacent islands.\n\nIn 1910, [[Korean Empire|Korea]] was [[Korea under Japanese rule|annexed]] by [[Imperial Japan]]. At the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] at the [[End of World War II in Asia|end of World War II]] in 1945, Korea was [[Division of Korea|divided into two zones]], with the [[Soviet Civil Administration|north occupied by the Soviet Union]] and the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea|south occupied by the United States]]. Negotiations on [[Korean reunification|reunification]] failed, and in 1948, separate governments were formed: the socialist Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the north, and the capitalist [[First Republic of Korea|Republic of Korea]] in the south. An invasion initiated by North Korea led to the [[Korean War]] (1950\u20131953). The [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] brought about a ceasefire, but no peace treaty was signed.\n\nNorth Korea officially describes itself as a \"self-reliant\" [[socialist state]], and formally [[Elections in North Korea|holds elections]], though they have been described by outside observers as [[sham election]]s. Outside observers also generally view North Korea as a [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] [[dictatorship]], particularly noting the elaborate [[North Korean cult of personality|cult of personality]] around the [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim dynasty]]. The [[Workers' Party of Korea]] (WPK), led by a member of the ruling family, holds absolute power in the state and leads the [[Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland]] of which all political officers are required to be members. ''[[Juche]]'', an ideology of national self-reliance, was introduced into [[Constitution of North Korea|the constitution]] in 1972. The [[means of production]] are owned by the state through [[state-run enterprise]]s and [[Collective farming|collectivized farms]]. Most service\u2014such as healthcare, education, housing and food production\u2014are subsidized or state-funded. From 1994 to 1998, North Korea suffered [[North Korean famine|a famine]] that resulted in the deaths of between 240,000 and 420,000 people, and the population continues to suffer malnutrition. North Korea follows ''[[Songun]]'', or \"military-first\" policy. It is the [[List of countries by number of troops|country with the highest number of military and paramilitary personnel]], with a total of 9,495,000 active, reserve and paramilitary personnel, or approximately {{Percentage|9495000|{{UN_Population|Dem. People's Republic of Korea}}}} of its population. Its active duty army of 1.21 million is the fourth largest in the world, after China, the [[United States]] and [[India]]; consisting of {{Percentage|1210000|{{UN_Population|Dem. People's Republic of Korea}}|1}} of its population. It [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|possesses nuclear weapons]]. In addition to being a member of the [[United Nations]] since 1991, North Korea is also a member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], [[Group of 77|G77]] and the [[ASEAN Regional Forum]].\n\nA 2014 UN inquiry into [[human rights in North Korea]] concluded that \"the gravity, scale and nature of these violations reveal a state that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world\". The North Korean regime denies these allegations.\n\n== Etymology ==\n{{See also|Names of Korea}}\nThe name ''Korea'' derives from the name ''Goryeo'' (also spelled ''Kory\u014f''). The name ''Goryeo'' itself was first used by the ancient kingdom of [[Goguryeo]] (Kogury\u014f) which was one of the great powers in [[East Asia]] during its time,<ref>{{cite

Some of them took part in allied action in China and parts of [[South East Asia]]. One of the guerrilla leaders was the communist [[Kim Il-sung]], who later became the first leader of North Korea.\n\nAfter the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] at the [[End of World War II in Asia|end of World War II]] in 1945, [[Division of Korea|the Korean Peninsula was divided]] into two zones along the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]], with the northern half of the peninsula occupied by the Soviet Union and the southern half [[United States Army Military Government in Korea|by the United States]]. Negotiations on [[Korean reunification|reunification]] failed. Soviet general [[Terentii Shtykov]] recommended the establishment of the [[Soviet Civil Authority]] in October 1945, and supported [[Kim Il-sung]] as chairman of the [[Provisional People's Committee for North Korea]], established in February 1946. In September 1946, South Korean citizens rose up against the Allied Military Government. In April 1948, an [[Jeju Uprising|uprising of the Jeju islanders]] was violently crushed.

Extensive Soviet and Chinese support allowed North Korea to rapidly recover from the Korean War and register very high growth rates. Systematic inefficiency began to arise around 1960, when the economy shifted from the [[extensive growth|extensive]] to the [[intensive growth|intensive development]] stage. The shortage of skilled labor, energy, arable land and transportation significantly impeded long-term growth and resulted in consistent failure to meet planning objectives.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p = 138}} The major slowdown of the economy contrasted with South Korea, which surpassed the North in terms of absolute [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] and per capita income by the 1980s.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p = 142}} North Korea declared the last seven-year plan unsuccessful in December 1993 and thereafter stopped announcing plans.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p = 140}}\n\n[[File:Industry Hamhung, North Korea.jpg|thumb|An industrial plant in [[Hamhung]]]]\n\nThe loss of [[Eastern Bloc]] trading partners and a series of natural disasters throughout the 1990s caused severe hardships, including widespread [[famine]].
