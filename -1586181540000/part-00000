In the mid-16th century, Spanish expeditions led by [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]] (1540) and [[Juan Pardo (explorer)|Juan Pardo]] (1567) passed through what is now Sevier County, reporting that the region was part of the domain of [[Chiaha]], a minor [[Muskogean language|Muskogean]] chiefdom centered around a village located on a now-submerged island just upstream from modern [[Douglas Dam]].  By the late 17th-century, however, the [[Cherokee]]&mdash; whose ancestors were living in the mountains at the time of the Spaniards' visit&mdash; had become the dominant tribe in the region.  Although they used the region primarily as hunting grounds, the [[Chickamauga Cherokee|Chicakamauga]] faction of the Cherokee vehemently fought white settlement in their territory, frequently leading raids on households, even through the signing of various peace treaties, alternating short periods of peace with violent hostility,   until forcibly marched from their territory by the U.S. government on the \"[[Trail of Tears]]\".<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/trte/ Trail of Tears], National Park Service.

The county takes its name from [[John Sevier]], governor of the failed [[State of Franklin]] and first governor of Tennessee, who played a prominent role during the early years of settlement in the region.<ref>[http://www.state.tn.us/sos/bluebook/online/section5/counties.pdf Origins of Tennessee County Names], ''Tennessee Blue Book'', 2005, p. 512.</ref> Since its establishment in 1795, the county seat has been situated at Sevierville (also named for Sevier), the eighth-oldest city in Tennessee.\n\nSevier County was strongly pro-Union during the Civil War.  When Tennessee held a vote on the state's Ordinance of Secession on June 8, 1861, Sevier Countians voted 1,528 to 60 in favor of remaining in the Union.<ref>Oliver Perry Temple, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=g8xYAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA199&dq=%22The+detailed+vote+of+the+several+counties+was+as+follows%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YXBpUqGNCMajkQf-iIBA&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22The%20detailed%20vote%20of%20the%20several%20counties%20was%20as%20follows%22&f=false East Tennessee and the Civil War]'' (R.

However, with the creation of the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]] in the early 1930s, the future of Sevier County (within which lies thirty percent of the total area of the national park) changed drastically. Today, tourism supports the county's economy.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Sunset At Clingmans Dome.JPG|right|285px|thumb|Mountains over Sevier County at sunset from the Great Smoky Mountains National Park]]\n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|598|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|593|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|5.2|sqmi}} (0.9%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/counties_list_47.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=April 14, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files}}</ref> The southern part of Sevier County is located within the [[Great Smoky Mountains]], and is protected by the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]]. The northern parts of the county are located within the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians]]. Sevier contains the highest point in Tennessee, [[Clingmans Dome]], which rises to {{convert|6643|ft|m}} along the county's border with North Carolina. [[Mount Guyot (Great Smoky Mountains)|Mount Guyot]], located in the Eastern Smokies in the extreme eastern part of the county, is the state's second-highest mountain at {{convert|6621|ft|m}}. The {{convert|6593|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Mount Le Conte (Tennessee)|Mount Le Conte]], a very prominent mountain visible from much of the central part of the county, is the state's third-highest.\n\nSevier County is drained primarily by the [[French Broad River]], which passes through the northern part of the county. A portion of the French Broad is part of [[Douglas Lake]], an artificial reservoir created by [[Douglas Dam]] in the northeastern part of the county. The three forks of the [[Little Pigeon River (Tennessee)|Little Pigeon River]] (East, Middle, and West) flow northward from the Smokies, converge near Sevierville, and empty into the French Broad north of Sevierville. The West Fork is the best known, as it flows through the popular tourist areas of Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge.\n\nThe maximum elevation differential in Sevier County is the greatest in Tennessee, ranging from a high of {{convert|6643|ft|m}} at Clingmans Dome to a low of {{convert|850|ft|m}} at the French Broad River.<ref>Tom Dunigan, \"[http://tnlandforms.us/cohp/ Tennessee County High Points],\" Tennessee Landforms, November 2, 2012.

Establishments in what is now the national park felled large amounts of timber in the early 1900s. Though the park effectively killed the logging industry in the late 1930s, it spurred the development of one of the largest tourist resorts in the United States of America, as the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is now the most visited national park in the country.<ref>[http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0004743.html Great Smoky Mountains National Park-infoplease.com Ten Most Visited National Parks].

By the late 17th-century, however, the [[Cherokee]]&mdash; whose ancestors were living in the mountains at the time of the Spaniards' visit&mdash; had become the dominant tribe in the region.  Although they used the region primarily as hunting grounds, the [[Chickamauga Cherokee|Chicakamauga]] faction of the Cherokee vehemently fought white settlement in their territory, frequently leading raids on households, even through the signing of various peace treaties, alternating short periods of peace with violent hostility,   until forcibly marched from their territory by the U.S. government on the \"[[Trail of Tears]]\".<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/trte/ Trail of Tears], National Park Service.

One of the very reasons for the park's creation, however, was also one of the county's first major economic engines: the lumber industry. Establishments in what is now the national park felled large amounts of timber in the early 1900s. Though the park effectively killed the logging industry in the late 1930s, it spurred the development of one of the largest tourist resorts in the United States of America, as the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is now the most visited national park in the country.<ref>[http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0004743.html Great Smoky Mountains National Park-infoplease.com Ten Most Visited National Parks].

From the exit, the Parkway follows Tennessee State Route 66 (\"[[Winfield Dunn]] Parkway\") into Sevierville, where it becomes [[U.S. Route 441]]/[[Tennessee State Route 71]] as TN-66 terminates at a four-way intersection where US-441 splits from [[U.S. Route 411]] and changes direction. It continues along US-441 through Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg, before entering the national park, where it ascends to the crest of the Smokies at [[Newfound Gap]] and crosses into [[North Carolina]] (although by this time it is no longer known as the \"Great Smoky Mountains Parkway\"). The Parkway is joined [[U.S. Route 321]] in Pigeon Forge and they run concurrently until US-321 splits away in downtown Gatlinburg.

His left hand has been replaced by an advanced computer shaped like his missing hand and protected by some transparent material. Three fingers are missing; the computer tells him they must be reattached before it can tell Trent what is going on. Trent is being hunted by a handful of [[humanoid]] aliens called the Kyben; they have the missing appendages. The action takes place in a large rundown office building which the Kyben have sealed off from the world. In this deadly game of hide-and-seek, Trent enlists the help of Consuelo Biros ([[Arlene Martel]]), a woman who works in the building.\n\nFor reasons unknown to him, Trent was sent into the past via a \"time mirror\", located in the building. A captured Kyben tells Trent that both of them are from a thousand years in the future. In that future, Earth has been conquered by the Kyben, but all the surviving humans except Trent have mysteriously vanished. The aliens are being obliterated by a \"radioactive plague\" that is killing all of the Kyben occupation force, a plague pparently unleashed by the humans in a last-ditch effort to repel the invasion. In a desperate attempt to find a cure for the plague and to extract whatever knowledge is stored in the hand/computer, the Kyben have followed him back in time with the missing fingers.\n\nEventually, Trent defeats all of his Kyben hunters by ripping off the medallion-shaped devices they wear to anchor them in the past. Trent successfully destroys the mirror and recovers the missing fingers, one by one. When the computer is whole, he learns the terrible truth: he is not a man, but a robot. The human survivors have been digitally encoded onto a gold-copper alloy wire wrapped around the [[solenoid]] in his [[thorax]]. Immune to disease, he must protect his precious cargo for 1,200 years, after the Kyben invasion, by which time the plague will have dissipated. Then he will resurrect the human race.\n\nTrent had thought he was a man, as he and Consuelo had begun to develop feelings for each other. With the truth revealed, she leaves him, pity mixed with horror in her eyes. Trent is left to face 1,200 years of lonely vigil.\n\n== Closing narration ==\n<blockquote style=font-size:100%>\"Like the Eternal Man of Babylonian legend, like Gilgamesh, one thousand plus two hundred years stretches before Trent.

Because this would have been prohibitively expensive, producer [[Robert H. Justman]] suggested that Ellison contain most of the action in a single structure when he went to script. Ellison agreed, realizing that by forcing the plot into an enclosed space, the change from a linear pursuit to a vertical climb&nbsp;\u2014 ascending as the action developed&nbsp;\u2014 would make for heightened tension. Most of this episode was shot in the [[Bradbury Building]], the same location used for the final scenes of ''[[Blade Runner]]'' and a closing scene in the 1950 film noir classic ''[[D.O.A. (1949 film)|D.O.A.]]''\n\nEllison's 10-page story outline was published in ''Brain Movies III'' in 2013.<ref>''Brain Movies: The Original Teleplays of Harlan Ellison Volume III'', pgs 115-124, Edgeworks Abbey, {{ISBN|978-0-9895257-0-1}}</ref>\n\nEllison's friendship with Robert Culp dates from the production of this episode. He found Culp to be very intelligent, quite a contrast to most actors, whom he described as \"dips&nbsp;\u2014 strictly ''[[non compos mentis]].''\" When Culp first met Ellison at the Bradbury building location for the film, Ellison introduced himself in a loud voice and told the actor that he had written the episode just for him. Culp also stated that he felt it was one of the best-written episodes of television in the history of the medium. Culp indicated that he felt the success of the series and this episode was due to the fact that it was, essentially, a morality play.<ref>http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/robert-culp#</ref>\n\n== Adaptations and unproduced sequel ==\nA [[graphic novel]] adaptation, illustrated by [[Marshall Rogers]], was published by [[DC Comics]] January 1986.

Michael Straczynski]] often said that Ellison would write a sequel to this story (possibly called \"Demon in the Dust\" or \"Demon on the Run\") as an episode. However, the proposed sequel episode never appeared. Ellison was a creative consultant on the series and said in a behind-the-scene book about ''Babylon 5'' written during that show's third season:<ref>Bassom, David (1996), Creating Babylon 5.

This was also its last UK terrestrial television broadcast.<ref>[http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/outer.htm A Television Heaven review] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930000400/http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/outer.htm |date=2010-09-30}} /Radio Times/Shadow Play fanzine No.1, page 16 (1986) article by Terry Doyle</ref><ref>Starburst&nbsp;\u2014 A Marvel Monthly No.30 Volume 1,number 6 (Jan 1981),page 46</ref><ref>TV Zone article by Tise Vahimagi</ref>\n\n== Feature film ==\nOn June 20, 2014, it was announced that the episode would be adapted as a motion picture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/06/20/the-outer-limits-scott-derrickson-c-robert-cargill/|title=Classic sci-fi TV show 'The Outer Limits' coming to the big screen|work=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com}}</ref>\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{TV.com episode|the-outer-limits-1963/demon-with-a-glass-hand-21566|Demon with a Glass Hand}}\n* {{IMDb title | tt0667812}}\n\n{{Harlan Ellison}}\n{{Epic of Gilgamesh}}\n\n{{The Outer Limits}}\n{{WritersGuildofAmericaAnthologyAnyLength}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Demon With A Glass Hand}}\n[[Category:The Outer Limits (1963 TV series season 2) episodes]]\n[[Category:1964 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:Television episodes written by Harlan Ellison]]\n[[Category:Robots in fiction]]\n[[Category:Television episodes about time travel]]\n", "name_user": "Mr. Laser Beam", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_with_a_Glass_Hand"}
