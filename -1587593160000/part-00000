An Executive Team guides and develops WWF's strategy. There is also a National Council which stands as an advisory group to the board and a team of scientists and experts in conservation who research for WWF.\n\nNational and international law plays an important role in determining how habitats and resources are managed and used. Laws and regulations become one of the organization's global priorities.\n\nThe WWF has been opposed to the extraction of oil from the Canadian [[tar sands]] and has campaigned on this matter. Between 2008 and 2010 the WWF worked with [[The Co-operative Group]], the [[UK]]'s largest [[consumer co-operative]] to publish reports which concluded that: (1) exploiting the Canadian tar sands to their full potential would be sufficient to bring about what they described as 'runaway climate change;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.co-operative.coop/upload/ToxicFuels/docs/WWF_CFS_Unconventionals_report.pdf|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708080954/http://www.co-operative.coop/upload/ToxicFuels/docs/WWF_CFS_Unconventionals_report.pdf|archivedate=8 July 2015|url-status=dead|accessdate=5 June 2015}}</ref> (2) carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology cannot be used to reduce the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere to a level comparable to that of other methods of oil extraction;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.co-operative.coop/upload/ToxicFuels/docs/CCS-in-the-Alberta-oil-sands-a-dangerous-myth.pdf|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923205501/http://www.co-operative.coop/upload/ToxicFuels/docs/CCS-in-the-Alberta-oil-sands-a-dangerous-myth.pdf|archivedate=23 September 2015|url-status=dead|accessdate=5 June 2015}}</ref> (3) the $379 billion which is expected to be spent extracting oil from [[tar sands]] could be better spent on research and development in renewable energy technology;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.co-operative.coop/upload/ToxicFuels/docs/opportunity-cost-report.pdf|title=Opportunity cost of tar sands development|work=co-operative.coop|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906001129/https://www.co-operative.coop/upload/ToxicFuels/docs/opportunity-cost-report.pdf|archivedate=6 September 2015|url-status=dead|accessdate=25 September 2018}}</ref> and (4) the expansion of tar sands extraction poses a serious threat to the caribou in Alberta .<ref>http://www.co-operative.coop/upload/ToxicFuels/docs/caribou-report.pdf</ref>\n\nThe organization convinces and helps governments and other political bodies to adopt, enforce, strengthen and/or change policies, guidelines and laws that affect biodiversity and natural resource use.

It also undertakes public campaigns to influence decision makers, and seeks to educate people on how to live in a more environmentally friendly manner. It urges people to donate funds to protect the environment.

The World Wrestling Federation filed an appeal in October 2001. However, on 10 May 2002, the World Wrestling Federation changed its [[Web address]] from ''WWF.com'' to ''WWE.com'', and replaced every \"WWF\" reference on the existing site with \"WWE\", as a prelude to changing the company's name to \"World Wrestling Entertainment.\" Its stock ticker also switched from WWF to WWE.\n\nThe wrestling organization's abandonment of the \"WWF\" [[initialism]] did not end the two organizations' legal conflict. Later in 2002, the World Wide Fund for Nature petitioned the court for $360 million in damages, but was not successful. A subsequent request to overturn by the World Wide Fund for Nature was dismissed by the British [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] on 28 June 2007. In 2003, World Wrestling Entertainment won a limited decision which permitted them to continue marketing certain pre-existing products with the abandoned WWF logo. However, WWE was mandated to issue newly branded merchandise such as apparel, action figures, video games, and [[DVD]]s with the \"WWE\" initials. Additionally, the court order required the company to remove both auditory and visual references to \"WWF\" in its library of video footage outside the United Kingdom.\n\nStarting with the 1,000th episode of ''Raw'' in July 2012, the WWF \"scratch\" logo is no longer censored in archival footage. In addition, the WWF initials are no longer censored when spoken or when written in plain text in archival footage.

Releasing an official statement, the WWF claimed that the report was not made public to ensure the safety of the victims and that the guards were suspended and are awaiting prosecution.

The World Wrestling Federation filed an appeal in October 2001. However, on 10 May 2002, the World Wrestling Federation changed its [[Web address]] from ''WWF.com'' to ''WWE.com'', and replaced every \"WWF\" reference on the existing site with \"WWE\", as a prelude to changing the company's name to \"World Wrestling Entertainment.\" Its stock ticker also switched from WWF to WWE.\n\nThe wrestling organization's abandonment of the \"WWF\" [[initialism]] did not end the two organizations' legal conflict. Later in 2002, the World Wide Fund for Nature petitioned the court for $360 million in damages, but was not successful. A subsequent request to overturn by the World Wide Fund for Nature was dismissed by the British [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] on 28 June 2007. In 2003, World Wrestling Entertainment won a limited decision which permitted them to continue marketing certain pre-existing products with the abandoned WWF logo. However, WWE was mandated to issue newly branded merchandise such as apparel, action figures, video games, and [[DVD]]s with the \"WWE\" initials. Additionally, the court order required the company to remove both auditory and visual references to \"WWF\" in its library of video footage outside the United Kingdom.\n\nStarting with the 1,000th episode of ''Raw'' in July 2012, the WWF \"scratch\" logo is no longer censored in archival footage. In addition, the WWF initials are no longer censored when spoken or when written in plain text in archival footage.  In exchange, WWE is no longer permitted to use the WWF initials or logo in any new, original footage, packaging, or advertising, with any old-school logos for retro-themed programming now using a modification of the original WWF logo without the F.\n\n=== Mekong River dolphins report ===\nIn June 2009, Touch Seang Tana, chairman of [[Cambodia]]'s Commission for Conservation and Development of the [[Mekong River]] Dolphins Eco-tourism Zone, argued that the WWF had misrepresented the danger of extinction of the [[Irrawaddy dolphin|Mekong dolphin]] to boost fundraising.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://english.cri.cn/6966/2009/06/24/2001s496246.htm |title=Cambodia Rejects CNN, WWF Reports about Mekong Dolphin |publisher=CRIEnglish.com |date=24 June 2009 |accessdate=2 March 2013}}</ref> The report stated that the deaths were caused by a bacterial disease that became fatal due to environmental contaminants suppressing the dolphins' immune systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/?167401/Mekong-dolphins-on-the-brink-of-extinction|title=Mekong dolphins on the brink of extinction|access-date=21 September 2016}}</ref> He called the report unscientific and harmful to the Cambodian government and threatened the WWF's Cambodian branch with suspension unless they met with him to discuss his claims.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://khmerization.blogspot.com/2009/06/cambodia-threatens-to-suspend-wwf-after.html |title=Cambodia threatens to suspend WWF after dolphin report |accessdate=2 August 2017}}</ref> Touch Seang Tana later said he would not press charges of supplying false information and would not make any attempt to prevent WWF from continuing its work in Cambodia, but advised WWF to adequately explain its findings and check with the commission before publishing another report.
