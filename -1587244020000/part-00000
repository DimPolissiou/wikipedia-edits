The player assumes the role of Marina, a robotic maid who journeys to rescue her creator from the emperor of Planet Clancer. The gameplay revolves around grabbing, shaking, and throwing objects. There are five worlds and 52 levels, and the game is displayed in [[2.5D]].\n\nThe game was the first 2D side-scrolling game for the Nintendo 64, and Treasure's first release for a Nintendo console. The company began ''Mischief Makers''{{'s}} development in mid-1995 with little knowledge of the console's features. The 12-person team wanted to make a novel gameplay mechanic, and implementing the resultant \"catching\" technique became their most difficult task. The game appeared at the 1997 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] and was released in Japan on June 27, 1997, and later in the United States, Europe, and Australia.\n\nThe game received \"mixed or average reviews\", according to video game review score aggregator [[Metacritic]]. Critics praised ''Mischief Makers''{{'s}} inventiveness, personality, and [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] fights, but criticized its brevity, low difficulty, low [[replay value]], sound, and harsh introductory learning curve. Retrospective reviewers disagreed with the originally poor reception, and multiple reviewers noted Marina's signature \"Shake, shake!\" [[sound bite]] as a highlight. Video game journalists cited ''Mischief Makers'' as ripe for reissue either through the [[Nintendo eShop]] or in a sequel or franchise reboot. In 2009, ''[[GamesRadar]]'' called it \"possibly the most underrated and widely ignored game on the N64\".\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\n[[File:MischiefMakers--article image.jpg|thumb|left|Marina grabs a bomb. \"Clanball\" platforms and warp stars float nearby.|alt=A rainbow-colored spectrum in a futuristic gauge is in the upper-left area of the heads-up display.

At the time, they knew little about the Nintendo 64's final technical specifications, graphics implementation, and [[development kit]], but were nevertheless interested in the console and its improved \"[[pixel]] quality\".{{r|IGN: Treasure talks}} Historically, Treasure developed games exclusively for Sega consoles,{{r|IGN: Treasure talks}}{{efn|Treasure continued to develop for the [[Sega Genesis]] even while Nintendo had market control because they found the Genesis development process easier.{{r|IGN: Treasure talks}}}} which made ''Mischief Makers'' their first release for a Nintendo console.{{r|Nintendo Life review}} Bringing ''Mischief Makers'' to the Nintendo 64 was a hardware-based decision:{{r|IGN: Treasure talks}} the Nintendo 64's [[video game cartridge|cartridges]] were more expensive than [[CD-ROM]]s, but they loaded data instantly and were thus more conducive for [[action games]] such as ''Mischief Makers''. However, Treasure [[CEO]] Masato Maegawa said that development for the Nintendo 64 had a harsher learning curve than even the [[Sega Saturn]]. Other than the special attention required to build a single boss in 3D, the team did not use features specific to the Nintendo 64 hardware.{{r|IGN: Treasure talks}}\n\nTreasure's founders had come from [[Konami]], where they worked on [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] games such as ''[[Castlevania (1986 video game)|Castlevania]]'' and ''[[Contra (video game)|Contra]]''.{{r|IGN review}} They found their development environment restrictive and left to try riskier concepts and to singularly focus on making \"great games\".{{r|IGN: Treasure talks}} In the three years between Treasure's founding and ''Mischief Makers''{{'s}} development, the company released highly regarded games such as ''[[Gunstar Heroes]]''{{emdash}}known as \"one of the definitive [[16-bit era|16-bit]] action games\"{{emdash}}and ''[[Dynamite Headdy]]''.{{r|IGN: Treasure talks}} An average of 12 people worked on ''Mischief Makers'', with up to 15 at times. Though the team was different in composition from that of previous Treasure titles, it included the lead programmer and character designer from ''Gunstar Heroes''. Treasure's CEO said that the company liked to expand into new genres, though they primarily work in genres where the staff had the experience. The company sought to depart from the ''Gunstar Heroes'' [[shoot 'em up]] design, and chose to build ''Mischief Makers'' around an original \"catching\" gameplay mechanic, which became the hardest aspect to implement.{{r|IGN: Treasure talks}} While foreign (non-Japanese) aesthetics were popular with other Japanese developers, Treasure's CEO felt the company's games did not look \"particularly foreign\" and could appeal to Japanese audiences.{{r|IGN: Treasure talks}}\n\nThe game was Treasure's first to be published by [[Enix]]. The publisher sought out Treasure for their reputation in the action game genre, and had approached Treasure several times before the Nintendo 64 project surfaced.{{efn|Treasure CEO Maegawa was already fond of Enix, having applied to work there as a student (though he did not get the job).{{r|IGN: Treasure talks}}}} Upon choosing to make the game for the Nintendo 64, Treasure thought it would be a \"good idea\" to work with Enix.{{r|IGN: Treasure talks}} And similar to how Treasure ended its historic loyalty to the [[Sega Genesis]] by developing ''Mischief Makers'' for Nintendo, Enix had just recently ended its historic loyalty to Nintendo by signing ''[[Dragon Quest VII]]'' of their ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' franchise to Sony. Neither Square or Enix built a \"special relationship\" with Nintendo specific for ''Mischief Makers''{{'s}} release,{{r|IGN: Treasure talks}} though Nintendo later served as the game's publisher for Western markets.{{r|IGN: Nintendo to publish}} Prior to Nintendo proposing to publish the game in the West, Enix said it had no plans to release the game outside Japan.{{r|GPro107}} When their English localization of the Japanese game finished ahead of schedule, the North American release date was advanced two weeks accordingly.{{r|IGN: Griffey}}\n\n''Mischief Makers'' was the only game displayed at the Enix booth at the April 1997 Tokyo Game Show.{{r|EGM95}} It was later demonstrated at the 1997 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]]{{r|IGN: Nintendo to publish}} and released in Japan on June 27, 1997, the United States on October 1, and Europe and Australia on January 15, 1998.{{r|IGN review}} Its Japanese title is ''Yuke-Yuke Trouble Makers'', or ''Go-Go Trouble Makers''.{{r|IGN: Treasure talks}} Near the time of the game's Japanese launch, Treasure announced that they would continue to develop for the Nintendo 64 with the Japan-only ''[[Bakuretsu Muteki Bangaioh]]'', which was released in September and later introduced to North America as ''Bangai-O''.{{r|IGN: Bakuretsu}}\n\n== Reception ==\n\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = 70/100{{r|Metacritic}}\n| Allgame = {{Rating|3.5|5|AllGame review}}\n| EGM = 8/10{{r|EGM review}}\n| Fam = 32/40{{r|Famitsu}}\n| GameFan = 95%{{r|GameFan review}}\n| GI = 7/10{{r|GI review}}\n| GSpot = 6.7/10{{r|GS review}}\n| IGN = 6.2/10{{r|IGN review}}\n| NGen = {{rating|3|5}}{{r|NG review}}\n| NLife = {{Rating|8|10|Nintendo Life review}}\n| NP = 6.9/10{{r|NP review}}\n}}\n\n''Mischief Makers'' received \"mixed or average reviews\", according to video game review score aggregator [[Metacritic]],{{r|Metacritic}} and a \"Gold Hall of Fame\" score of 32/40 from Japanese magazine ''[[Famitsu]]''.{{r|Famitsu}} Critics praised the game's inventiveness, personality, \"variety\", and boss fights,{{r|Nintendo Life review|AllGame review|GS review|EGM review}} and criticized its brevity, low difficulty, low [[replay value]],{{r|AllGame review|GS review|GI review}} sound,{{r|IGN review|NP review|GS review|NG review}} and harsh introductory learning curve.{{r|Nintendo Life review|AllGame review|EGM review}} Retrospective reviewers disagreed with the game's originally poor reception,{{r|Gamasutra|GamesRadar: untapped}} and multiple reviewers noted Marina's signature \"Shake, shake!\" [[sound bite]] as a highlight.{{r|NWR review|AllGame review|EGM review}} ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' awarded the game their silver award.{{r|EGM review}}\n\n''[[IGN]]''{{'}}s Matt Casamassina said that the game compensated for its average graphics with excellent level design and gameplay challenges. He added that the game's puzzles require thought, unlike those in other action/platform games, and that the game's objectives were not clear until after the first few levels. Casamassina praised the game's transparency effects, [[Spatial anti-aliasing|anti-aliasing]], [[mipmapping]], and scaling rotations.{{r|IGN review}} ''IGN'' described anticipation for the game as \"tremendous\",{{r|IGN: Nintendo to publish}} particularly among the game's market of \"younger gamers and 2D fans\".{{r|IGN: Griffey}} ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' thought that the game was the best side-scroller since ''[[Super Mario World]]''.{{r|NP review}} ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' wrote that \"only diehard 2D platform fans\" would be interested and did not feel that the game lived up to standards set by ''[[Super Mario 64|Mario 64]]''.{{r|NG review}} In contrast, ''[[GameFan]]'' said that ''Mischief Makers'' did for 2D what ''Mario 64'' did for 3D, and suggested that [[Sega]] should be influenced by the game.{{r|GameFan spread}} ''[[GamesRadar]]'' retrospectively called ''Mischief Makers'' \"pure, unadulterated awesome\" and \"2D brilliance\". The website summarized the game to be about \"grabbing sad-faced aliens, shaking them until gems come out, and then hurling them at other sad-faced aliens.\"{{r|GamesRadar: untapped}} Zachary Miller of ''Nintendo World Report'' asserted the game may be the console's most bizarre and surreal,{{r|NWR review}} but ''[[Gamasutra]]''{{'s}} John Harris said that the game's premise is \"only strange to people who have never heard of [[anime]]\".{{r|Gamasutra}} ''GameFan'' described the game as \"obviously deeply Japanese\",{{r|GameFan spread}} where \"old school gameplay and 64-bit visuals finally meet\".{{r|GameFan review}}\n\n[[Hirokazu Hamamura]] of ''Famitsu'' commended ''Mischief Makers''{{'s}} gameplay, which balanced its poor character design. Other ''Famitsu'' reviewers admired Treasure's signature robot designs and were puzzled by the company's choice to use buttons instead of the 3D [[analog stick]].{{r|Famitsu}} ''[[Nintendo Life]]''{{'s}} Jamie O'Neill praised the game's characters and disliked the controls. He compared the Calina character to the role of Shadow Mario in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]''.{{r|Nintendo Life review}} O'Neill wrote that the intricate controls were \"the antithesis of a friendly, approachable, and intuitive platformer\" because the game used every button on the controller (including the [[directional pad]]), though he felt that players who persevered through the difficult controls would find them \"inventive and unique\".{{r|Nintendo Life review}} He added that the complex controls allowed for experimentation that led to new and fun gameplay, and though the throwing enemies mechanic seemed to follow from ''Gunstar Heroes'', the Clanball platforming was unintuitive.{{r|Nintendo Life review}} John Harris of ''Gamasutra'' wrote that the game borrowed other elements from ''Gunstar Heroes'', as the games were similar in protagonists, collectible gems,{{efn|He added that the gems awarded for \"A\" rating finish times were difficult to collect.{{r|Gamasutra}}}} and bosses.{{r|Gamasutra}}{{efn|Harris also put Marina's \"grab\" in a lineage of Treasure's signature [[counterattack]] mechanics (where a player can escape an attack with a well-timed button press), which he extrapolated out to counterattacks in ''[[Viewtiful Joe]]'' and ''[[Soul Calibur]]''.{{r|Gamasutra}}}} As the game took time to learn and understand, O'Neill left the reader to decide whether the game was \"ultimately convoluted or bordering on sophistication and genius\".{{r|Nintendo Life review}}\n\n''Nintendo Life''{{'s}} O'Neill thought the five world bosses were among Treasure's best (in particular, the transforming \"Cerberus Alpha\" boss), but found the mid-level bosses uninteresting.{{r|Nintendo Life review}} Peter Bartholow of ''[[GameSpot]]''{{r|GS review}} and ''Electronic Gaming Monthly''{{'s}} reviewers felt similarly. [[Sushi-X]] of ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' added that the technique of looking for a boss's weak spot was similar to ''[[Metroid]]''.{{r|EGM review}} ''Famitsu'' reviewers praised how the game encouraged players to experiment with the basic \"grab, throw, and shake\" gameplay. They also appreciated the cadence of ''Mischief Makers''{{'s}} short levels.{{r|Famitsu}} O'Neill (''Nintendo Life'') thought the game had great variety in gameplay mechanics (from maze puzzles to outrunning lava), graphics (from bosses that scale back the screen to levels with screen rotation), and audio (from upbeat quirk to scary), and added that he was surprised to hear critics speak against the \"unique, varied, and dramatic\" sound.{{r|Nintendo Life review}} Scott McCall of ''[[AllGame]]'' too appreciated the sound, from the voice to the \"almost indescribable\" music.{{r|AllGame review}} ''Gamasutra''{{'s}} John Harris noted its \"tremendous variety\" in gameplay{{emdash}}from a ''[[Track & Field (video game)|Track & Field]]'' remake to outrunning a missile barrage{{emdash}}as rare for 2D platformers, and commented that \"it is obvious that Treasure poured their hearts into this game.\"{{r|Gamasutra}}\n\nPeter Bartholow of ''GameSpot'' summarized ''Mischief Makers'' as \"a good game that will leave players wanting more\".{{r|GS review}} He liked the bosses, which made the player use all available skills but felt they were short-lived and easily solved in the context of a short game with tutorials as one-fifth of its levels.{{r|GS review}} He did not consider the ending extension a suitable reward for returning to the levels, and predicted that most players would not finish the game more than once.{{r|GS review}} ''[[Game Informer]]'' echoed Bartholow's comments about the game's brevity, and named the game's seven-event Olympics as a highlight.{{r|GI review}} Sushi-X of ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' wrote that the game felt incomplete and lamented that \"a decent player can finish the game in under three hours\",{{r|EGM review}} though ''Next Generation'' said the game was \"certainly long enough\".{{r|NG review}} The game's frequent reuse of a small selection of titles, objects, sound effects, soundtracks, and bland backgrounds (compared to the \"impressive\" boss battle animations and effects) led ''GameSpot''{{'s}} Bartholow to suggest that ''Mischief Makers'' was limited by its cartridge space. He concluded that the \"decent\" game would be \"truly excellent ... on another medium\".{{r|GS review}} Zachary Miller of ''Nintendo World Report'' reported that the graphics did not age well into 2010.{{r|NWR review}} ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' wrote that the game is \"definitely a [[sleeper hit]]\".{{r|EGM review}} ''Hardcore Gamer''{{'s}} Ryan Cartmel said the game went \"largely unnoticed\",{{r|Hardcore Gamer}} while ''GamePro'' claimed that it had \"[developed] a strong following in Japan.\"{{r|GPro110}}\n\n=== Legacy ===\nVideo game journalists from outlets such as ''GamesRadar'' and ''Nintendo World Report'' cited ''Mischief Makers'' as ripe for reissue either through the [[Nintendo eShop]] or in a sequel or franchise reboot.{{r|GamesRadar: untapped|NWR}} ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' placed the \"masterpiece of mayhem\" 80th on their list of \"essential\" Nintendo 64 games for its \"unbridled quality\".{{r|Retro Gamer 31}} In 2009, ''GamesRadar'' called it \"possibly the most underrated and widely ignored game on the N64\".{{r|GamesRadar: untapped}}{{efn|In the years since, ''Retro Gamer'' reported ''Mischief Makers'' as a somewhat rare collectible, with a rarity score of 7/10.{{r|Retro Gamer 4}}}} The website wrote that ''Mischief Makers'' was received poorly because players wanted 3D instead of 2D gameplay from Nintendo 64 games.{{r|GamesRadar: untapped}} ''Gamasutra''{{'}}s John Harris added that those who gave it a \"bum rap\" missed a \"surprisingly clever\" game.{{r|Gamasutra}} [[UGO Networks|UGO]] remembered the game as innovative, though imperfect, and asked to see Marina reinterpreted and resurrected in a new game.{{r|UGO}}{{efn|Marina reappeared as an unlockable character in Treasure's 1999 ''[[Rakugaki Showtime]]''.{{r|Retro Gamer 52}}}}\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n{{notelist}}\n\n=== References ===\n\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"AllGame review\">{{cite web |url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=7508&tab=review |accessdate=May 10, 2014 |title=Mischief Makers - Review |last1=McCall |first1=Scott |work=[[AllGame]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PSzqiKZ4?url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=7508&tab=review |archivedate=May 10, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=EGM95>{{cite magazine |title=TGS 1997 Spring |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=95 |date=June 1997 |page=62}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"EGM review\">{{cite web|url=http://egm.gamespot.com/egm.nsf/WebAllReviewCrew/18553C11F0C8076F8825653900716AFF |accessdate=May 9, 2014 |title=Mischief Makers |date=January 21, 1998 |work=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |archiveurl=https://archive.is/19980121101148/http://egm.gamespot.com/egm.nsf/WebAllReviewCrew/18553C11F0C8076F8825653900716AFF |archivedate=January 21, 1998 |url-status=dead }} ''Electronic Gaming Monthly''{{'s}} component scores were 7.5/8.5/8.0/8.0.</ref>\n\n<ref name=Famitsu>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&a=page_h_title&title_id=2329 |accessdate=June 22, 2014 |script-title=ja:\u3086\u3051\u3086\u3051!! \u30c8\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u30e1\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u30ba |trans-title=Yukeyuke!

The player assumes the role of Marina, a robotic maid who journeys to rescue her creator from the emperor of Planet Clancer. The gameplay revolves around grabbing, shaking, and throwing objects. There are five worlds and 52 levels, and the game is displayed in [[2.5D]].\n\nThe game was the first 2D side-scrolling game for the Nintendo 64, and Treasure's first release for a Nintendo console. The company began ''Mischief Makers''{{'s}} development in mid-1995 with little knowledge of the console's features. The 12-person team wanted to make a novel gameplay mechanic, and implementing the resultant \"catching\" technique became their most difficult task. The game appeared at the 1997 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] and was released in Japan on June 27, 1997, and later in the United States, Europe, and Australia.\n\nThe game received \"mixed or average reviews\", according to video game review score aggregator [[Metacritic]]. Critics praised ''Mischief Makers''{{'s}} inventiveness, personality, and [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] fights, but criticized its brevity, low difficulty, low [[replay value]], sound, and harsh introductory learning curve. Retrospective reviewers disagreed with the originally poor reception, and multiple reviewers noted Marina's signature \"Shake, shake!\" [[sound bite]] as a highlight. Video game journalists cited ''Mischief Makers'' as ripe for reissue either through the [[Nintendo eShop]] or in a sequel or franchise reboot. In 2009, ''[[GamesRadar]]'' called it \"possibly the most underrated and widely ignored game on the N64\".\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\n[[File:MischiefMakers--article image.jpg|thumb|left|Marina grabs a bomb. \"Clanball\" platforms and warp stars float nearby.|alt=A rainbow-colored spectrum in a futuristic gauge is in the upper-left area of the heads-up display.

Floating balls with the same face float on the screen, as do rotate, neon-colored stars.]] ''Mischief Makers'' is the first [[single-player]] 2D [[side-scrolling]] [[platform game]] on the [[Nintendo 64]] console.{{r|IGN review}} Its gameplay combines platform [[game mechanics]] with aspects from the action and puzzle genres.{{r|Nintendo Life review}} The characters and backgrounds are modeled in pre-rendered 3D{{r|NP review}} similar to ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]''{{'s}} \"Advanced Computer Modeling\".{{r|Nintendo Life review}} This style, with 3D backgrounds behind 2D gameplay, is known as \"[[2.5D|{{frac|2|1|2}}D]]\".{{r|IGN: Griffey}} Compared to previous Treasure [[Run and gun (video game)|run and gun games]], ''Mischief Makers''{{'s}} gameplay is more exploratory in nature.{{r|NWR review}}\n\nThe [[player-character]], a robotic maid named Marina, journeys to save her kidnapped creator.{{r|IGN review}} The story takes place on Planet Clancer, a world on the cusp of civil war due to the actions of its Emperor and his Imperial forces. The Emperor brainwashes Clancers to kidnap the visiting robotics genius Professor Theo.{{r|Nintendo Life review}} Theo's creation, the player-character Ultra-InterGalactic-Cybot G Marina Liteyears, pursues the professor and grabs, throws, and shakes the obstacles in her way, such as enemies, floating \"Clanball\" platforms, warp stars, and missiles.{{r|Nintendo Life review}} Almost all game objects can be grabbed, which lends towards the shake-based combat system.{{r|NWR review}} Marina can shake \"grabbed\" objects to throw them as projectiles or to find loot.{{r|Gamasutra}} Objects sometimes change functions when shaken, such as items that become homing missiles and guns with multi-directional shots.{{r|Nintendo Life review}} Some drop red, blue, and green gems, which restore player [[Health (gaming)|health]].{{r|AllGame review}} The health gauge in the corner of the screen shows the amount of damage Marina can take.{{r|manual p15}} The player can store up to two additional stock lives.{{r|Nintendo Life review}} Yellow gems hidden in each level extend the final cutscene's length.{{r|NWR review|Gamasutra|GS review}} Marina can run, jump, and boost (via jetpack) in the eight [[Cardinal direction|cardinal and ordinal directions]].{{r|NWR review}} She can also slide, hover, and roll.{{r|AllGame review}}\n\nThe game has five worlds with roughly twelve [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] apiece.{{efn|The five worlds are Planet Clancer, Migen's Shrine, Mt. Snow, Aster's Lair, and the Imperial HQ, and there are 52 levels accessed via a [[overworld|stage select]] screen.{{r|IGN review}}}} Some levels are action-only while others include puzzles. The player's goal is to reach a warp star at each level's end. En route, Marina shakes enemies, breaks blocks, uses weapons, and rides \"bikes\" and objects along wire path mazes.{{r|IGN review}} Each world has both final and mid-level [[Boss (video gaming)|bosses]]. The levels and boss fights use [[Scale (ratio)|scaling]] and screen rotation [[special effects]] to vary the gameplay.{{r|Nintendo Life review}}\n\nAlmost all things on Planet Clancer{{emdash}}including people, buildings, and pets{{emdash}}either wear or are inscribed with identical \"sad\" faces with red, glowing eyes.{{r|NWR review}} A Clancer named Teran substitutes for Marina in several brief areas and uses non-shake mechanics like punching, kicking, and [[double jump (video gaming)|double jumping]].{{r|NWR review}} A character named Calina, a petulant Clancer who imitates Marina, recurs throughout the game as a [[comedic device]].{{r|Nintendo Life review}}\n\n== Development ==\n[[File:N64-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|The Nintendo 64 console|alt=The Nintendo 64 controller is the light gray controller with three handles for the player's two hands.

At the time, they knew little about the Nintendo 64's final technical specifications, graphics implementation, and [[development kit]], but were nevertheless interested in the console and it's improved \"[[pixel]] quality\".{{r|IGN: Treasure talks}} Historically, Treasure developed games exclusively for Sega consoles,{{r|IGN: Treasure talks}}{{efn|Treasure continued to develop for the [[Sega Genesis]] even while Nintendo had market control because they found the Genesis development process easier.{{r|IGN: Treasure talks}}}} which made ''Mischief Makers'' their first release for a Nintendo console.{{r|Nintendo Life review}} Bringing ''Mischief Makers'' to the Nintendo 64 was a hardware-based decision:{{r|IGN: Treasure talks}} the Nintendo 64's [[video game cartridge|cartridges]] were more expensive than [[CD-ROMs]], but they loaded data instantly and were thus more conducive for [[action games]] such as ''Mischief Makers''. However, Treasure [[CEO]] Masato Maegawa said that development for the Nintendo 64 had a harsher learning curve than even the [[Sega Saturn]]. Other than the special attention required to build a single boss in 3D, the team did not use features specific to the Nintendo 64 hardware.{{r|IGN: Treasure talks}}\n\nTreasure's founders had come from [[Konami]], where they worked on [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] games such as ''[[Castlevania (1986 video game)|Castlevania]]'' and ''[[Contra (video game)|Contra]]''.{{r|IGN review}} They found their development environment restrictive and left to try riskier concepts and to singularly focus on making \"great games\".{{r|IGN: Treasure talks}} In the three years between Treasure's founding and ''Mischief Makers''{{'s}} development, the company released highly regarded games such as ''[[Gunstar Heroes]]''{{emdash}}known as \"one of the definitive [[16-bit era|16-bit]] action games\"{{emdash}}and ''[[Dynamite Headdy]]''.{{r|IGN: Treasure talks}} An average of 12 people worked on ''Mischief Makers'', with up to 15 at times. Though the team was different in composition from that of previous Treasure titles, it included the lead programmer and character designer from ''Gunstar Heroes''. Treasure's CEO said that the company liked to expand into new genres, though they primarily work in genres where the staff had the experience. The company sought to depart from the ''Gunstar Heroes'' [[shoot 'em up]] design, and chose to build ''Mischief Makers'' around an original \"catching\" gameplay mechanic, which became the hardest aspect to implement.{{r|IGN: Treasure talks}} While foreign (non-Japanese) aesthetics were popular with other Japanese developers, Treasure's CEO felt the company's games did not look \"particularly foreign\" and could appeal to Japanese audiences.{{r|IGN: Treasure talks}}\n\nThe game was Treasure's first to be published by [[Enix]]. The publisher sought out Treasure for their reputation in the action game genre, and had approached Treasure several times before the Nintendo 64 project surfaced.{{efn|Treasure CEO Maegawa was already fond of Enix, having applied to work there as a student (though he did not get the job).{{r|IGN: Treasure talks}}}} Upon choosing to make the game for the Nintendo 64, Treasure thought it would be a \"good idea\" to work with Enix.{{r|IGN: Treasure talks}} And similar to how Treasure ended its historic loyalty to the [[Sega Genesis]] by developing ''Mischief Makers'' for Nintendo, Enix had just recently ended its historic loyalty to Nintendo by signing ''[[Dragon Quest VII]]'' of their ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' franchise to Sony. Neither Square or Enix built a \"special relationship\" with Nintendo specific for ''Mischief Makers''{{'s}} release,{{r|IGN: Treasure talks}} though Nintendo later served as the game's publisher for Western markets.{{r|IGN: Nintendo to publish}} Prior to Nintendo proposing to publish the game in the West, Enix said it had no plans to release the game outside Japan.{{r|GPro107}} When their English localization of the Japanese game finished ahead of schedule, the North American release date was advanced two weeks accordingly.{{r|IGN: Griffey}}\n\n''Mischief Makers'' was the only game displayed at the Enix booth at the April 1997 Tokyo Game Show.{{r|EGM95}} It was later demonstrated at the 1997 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]]{{r|IGN: Nintendo to publish}} and released in Japan on June 27, 1997, the United States on October 1, and Europe and Australia on January 15, 1998.{{r|IGN review}} Its Japanese title is ''Yuke-Yuke Trouble Makers'', or ''Go-Go Trouble Makers''.{{r|IGN: Treasure talks}} Near the time of the game's Japanese launch, Treasure announced that they would continue to develop for the Nintendo 64 with the Japan-only ''[[Bakuretsu Muteki Bangaioh]]'', which was released in September and later introduced to North America as ''Bangai-O''.{{r|IGN: Bakuretsu}}\n\n== Reception ==\n\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = 70/100{{r|Metacritic}}\n| Allgame = {{Rating|3.5|5|AllGame review}}\n| EGM = 8/10{{r|EGM review}}\n| Fam = 32/40{{r|Famitsu}}\n| GameFan = 95%{{r|GameFan review}}\n| GI = 7/10{{r|GI review}}\n| GSpot = 6.7/10{{r|GS review}}\n| IGN = 6.2/10{{r|IGN review}}\n| NGen = {{rating|3|5}}{{r|NG review}}\n| NLife = {{Rating|8|10|Nintendo Life review}}\n| NP = 6.9/10{{r|NP review}}\n}}\n\n''Mischief Makers'' received \"mixed or average reviews\", according to video game review score aggregator [[Metacritic]],{{r|Metacritic}} and a \"Gold Hall of Fame\" score of 32/40 from Japanese magazine ''[[Famitsu]]''.{{r|Famitsu}} Critics praised the game's inventiveness, personality, \"variety\", and boss fights,{{r|Nintendo Life review|AllGame review|GS review|EGM review}} and criticized its brevity, low difficulty, low [[replay value]],{{r|AllGame review|GS review|GI review}} sound,{{r|IGN review|NP review|GS review|NG review}} and harsh introductory learning curve.{{r|Nintendo Life review|AllGame review|EGM review}} Retrospective reviewers disagreed with the game's originally poor reception,{{r|Gamasutra|GamesRadar: untapped}} and multiple reviewers noted Marina's signature \"Shake, shake!\" [[sound bite]] as a highlight.{{r|NWR review|AllGame review|EGM review}} ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' awarded the game their silver award.{{r|EGM review}}\n\n''[[IGN]]''{{'}}s Matt Casamassina said that the game compensated for its average graphics with excellent level design and gameplay challenges. He added that the game's puzzles require thought, unlike those in other action/platform games, and that the game's objectives were not clear until after the first few levels. Casamassina praised the game's transparency effects, [[Spatial anti-aliasing|anti-aliasing]], [[mipmapping]], and scaling rotations.{{r|IGN review}} ''IGN'' described anticipation for the game as \"tremendous\",{{r|IGN: Nintendo to publish}} particularly among the game's market of \"younger gamers and 2D fans\".{{r|IGN: Griffey}} ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' thought that the game was the best side-scroller since ''[[Super Mario World]]''.{{r|NP review}} ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' wrote that \"only diehard 2D platform fans\" would be interested and did not feel that the game lived up to standards set by ''[[Super Mario 64|Mario 64]]''.{{r|NG review}} In contrast, ''[[GameFan]]'' said that ''Mischief Makers'' did for 2D what ''Mario 64'' did for 3D, and suggested that [[Sega]] should be influenced by the game.{{r|GameFan spread}} ''[[GamesRadar]]'' retrospectively called ''Mischief Makers'' \"pure, unadulterated awesome\" and \"2D brilliance\". The website summarized the game to be about \"grabbing sad-faced aliens, shaking them until gems come out, and then hurling them at other sad-faced aliens.\"{{r|GamesRadar: untapped}} Zachary Miller of ''Nintendo World Report'' asserted the game may be the console's most bizarre and surreal,{{r|NWR review}} but ''[[Gamasutra]]''{{'s}} John Harris said that the game's premise is \"only strange to people who have never heard of [[anime]]\".{{r|Gamasutra}} ''GameFan'' described the game as \"obviously deeply Japanese\",{{r|GameFan spread}} where \"old school gameplay and 64-bit visuals finally meet\".{{r|GameFan review}}\n\n[[Hirokazu Hamamura]] of ''Famitsu'' commended ''Mischief Makers''{{'s}} gameplay, which balanced its poor character design. Other ''Famitsu'' reviewers admired Treasure's signature robot designs and were puzzled by the company's choice to use buttons instead of the 3D [[analog stick]].{{r|Famitsu}} ''[[Nintendo Life]]''{{'s}} Jamie O'Neill praised the game's characters and disliked the controls. He compared the Calina character to the role of Shadow Mario in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]''.{{r|Nintendo Life review}} O'Neill wrote that the intricate controls were \"the antithesis of a friendly, approachable, and intuitive platformer\" because the game used every button on the controller (including the [[directional pad]]), though he felt that players who persevered through the difficult controls would find them \"inventive and unique\".{{r|Nintendo Life review}} He added that the complex controls allowed for experimentation that led to new and fun gameplay, and though the throwing enemies mechanic seemed to follow from ''Gunstar Heroes'', the Clanball platforming was unintuitive.{{r|Nintendo Life review}} John Harris of ''Gamasutra'' wrote that the game borrowed other elements from ''Gunstar Heroes'', as the games were similar in protagonists, collectible gems,{{efn|He added that the gems awarded for \"A\" rating finish times were difficult to collect.{{r|Gamasutra}}}} and bosses.{{r|Gamasutra}}{{efn|Harris also put Marina's \"grab\" in a lineage of Treasure's signature [[counterattack]] mechanics (where a player can escape an attack with a well-timed button press), which he extrapolated out to counterattacks in ''[[Viewtiful Joe]]'' and ''[[Soul Calibur]]''.{{r|Gamasutra}}}} As the game took time to learn and understand, O'Neill left the reader to decide whether the game was \"ultimately convoluted or bordering on sophistication and genius\".{{r|Nintendo Life review}}\n\n''Nintendo Life''{{'s}} O'Neill thought the five world bosses were among Treasure's best (in particular, the transforming \"Cerberus Alpha\" boss), but found the mid-level bosses uninteresting.{{r|Nintendo Life review}} Peter Bartholow of ''[[GameSpot]]''{{r|GS review}} and ''Electronic Gaming Monthly''{{'s}} reviewers felt similarly. [[Sushi-X]] of ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' added that the technique of looking for a boss's weak spot was similar to ''[[Metroid]]''.{{r|EGM review}} ''Famitsu'' reviewers praised how the game encouraged players to experiment with the basic \"grab, throw, and shake\" gameplay. They also appreciated the cadence of ''Mischief Makers''{{'s}} short levels.{{r|Famitsu}} O'Neill (''Nintendo Life'') thought the game had great variety in gameplay mechanics (from maze puzzles to outrunning lava), graphics (from bosses that scale back the screen to levels with screen rotation), and audio (from upbeat quirk to scary), and added that he was surprised to hear critics speak against the \"unique, varied, and dramatic\" sound.{{r|Nintendo Life review}} Scott McCall of ''[[AllGame]]'' too appreciated the sound, from the voice to the \"almost indescribable\" music.{{r|AllGame review}} ''Gamasutra''{{'s}} John Harris noted its \"tremendous variety\" in gameplay{{emdash}}from a ''[[Track & Field (video game)|Track & Field]]'' remake to outrunning a missile barrage{{emdash}}as rare for 2D platformers, and commented that \"it is obvious that Treasure poured their hearts into this game.\"{{r|Gamasutra}}\n\nPeter Bartholow of ''GameSpot'' summarized ''Mischief Makers'' as \"a good game that will leave players wanting more\".{{r|GS review}} He liked the bosses, which made the player use all available skills but felt they were short-lived and easily solved in the context of a short game with tutorials as one-fifth of its levels.{{r|GS review}} He did not consider the ending extension a suitable reward for returning to the levels, and predicted that most players would not finish the game more than once.{{r|GS review}} ''[[Game Informer]]'' echoed Bartholow's comments about the game's brevity, and named the game's seven-event Olympics as a highlight.{{r|GI review}} Sushi-X of ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' wrote that the game felt incomplete and lamented that \"a decent player can finish the game in under three hours\",{{r|EGM review}} though ''Next Generation'' said the game was \"certainly long enough\".{{r|NG review}} The game's frequent reuse of a small selection of titles, objects, sound effects, soundtracks, and bland backgrounds (compared to the \"impressive\" boss battle animations and effects) led ''GameSpot''{{'s}} Bartholow to suggest that ''Mischief Makers'' was limited by its cartridge space. He concluded that the \"decent\" game would be \"truly excellent ... on another medium\".{{r|GS review}} Zachary Miller of ''Nintendo World Report'' reported that the graphics did not age well into 2010.{{r|NWR review}} ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' wrote that the game is \"definitely a [[sleeper hit]]\".{{r|EGM review}} ''Hardcore Gamer''{{'s}} Ryan Cartmel said the game went \"largely unnoticed\",{{r|Hardcore Gamer}} while ''GamePro'' claimed that it had \"[developed] a strong following in Japan.\"{{r|GPro110}}\n\n=== Legacy ===\nVideo game journalists from outlets such as ''GamesRadar'' and ''Nintendo World Report'' cited ''Mischief Makers'' as ripe for reissue either through the [[Nintendo eShop]] or in a sequel or franchise reboot.{{r|GamesRadar: untapped|NWR}} ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' placed the \"masterpiece of mayhem\" 80th on their list of \"essential\" Nintendo 64 games for its \"unbridled quality\".{{r|Retro Gamer 31}} In 2009, ''GamesRadar'' called it \"possibly the most underrated and widely ignored game on the N64\".{{r|GamesRadar: untapped}}{{efn|In the years since, ''Retro Gamer'' reported ''Mischief Makers'' as a somewhat rare collectible, with a rarity score of 7/10.{{r|Retro Gamer 4}}}} The website wrote that ''Mischief Makers'' was received poorly because players wanted 3D instead of 2D gameplay from Nintendo 64 games.{{r|GamesRadar: untapped}} ''Gamasutra''{{'}}s John Harris added that those who gave it a \"bum rap\" missed a \"surprisingly clever\" game.{{r|Gamasutra}} [[UGO Networks|UGO]] remembered the game as innovative, though imperfect, and asked to see Marina reinterpreted and resurrected in a new game.{{r|UGO}}{{efn|Marina reappeared as an unlockable character in Treasure's 1999 ''[[Rakugaki Showtime]]''.{{r|Retro Gamer 52}}}}\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n{{notelist}}\n\n=== References ===\n\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"AllGame review\">{{cite web |url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=7508&tab=review |accessdate=May 10, 2014 |title=Mischief Makers - Review |last1=McCall |first1=Scott |work=[[AllGame]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PSzqiKZ4?url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=7508&tab=review |archivedate=May 10, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=EGM95>{{cite magazine |title=TGS 1997 Spring |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=95 |date=June 1997 |page=62}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"EGM review\">{{cite web|url=http://egm.gamespot.com/egm.nsf/WebAllReviewCrew/18553C11F0C8076F8825653900716AFF |accessdate=May 9, 2014 |title=Mischief Makers |date=January 21, 1998 |work=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |archiveurl=https://archive.is/19980121101148/http://egm.gamespot.com/egm.nsf/WebAllReviewCrew/18553C11F0C8076F8825653900716AFF |archivedate=January 21, 1998 |url-status=dead }} ''Electronic Gaming Monthly''{{'s}} component scores were 7.5/8.5/8.0/8.0.</ref>\n\n<ref name=Famitsu>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&a=page_h_title&title_id=2329 |accessdate=June 22, 2014 |script-title=ja:\u3086\u3051\u3086\u3051!! \u30c8\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u30e1\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u30ba |trans-title=Yukeyuke!

Soon afterward, Ted and Assia began an affair. At the time of Plath's suicide, Assia was pregnant with Hughes's child, but she had an abortion soon after Plath's death.

Hughes began affairs with Brenda Hedden, a married acquaintance who frequented their home, and Carol Orchard, a nurse 20 years his junior, whom he would later marry in 1970.

Several issues it addresses include: metering and reporting, energy-efficient product procurement, energy savings performance contracts, building performance standards, renewable energy requirements, and alternative fuel use. The effect on wind energy is through the renewable energy requirements.\n\n'''Renewable energy requirement'''\n\nThe Secretary of Energy shall, when technically and economically feasible, require the total electric energy consumed to be provided by renewable energy for the Federal government:\n\n1.

Qualifying for an ITC gives a credit of 30% on the cost of the property used for a wind facility. Cash grants eliminate the need for a partner to utilize tax credits. The carryback period was extended for the business credit, along with the bonus depreciation. Additional related incentives include 30% investment credits for manufacturers of renewable energy technologies, an increase in new clean renewable energy bonds to finance wind facilities, and funding towards advancing the electrical grid.<ref name=\"American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 - Wind Energy Provisions\">{{cite web|last=Mertens|first=Alexandra|title=American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 - Wind Energy Provisions|url=http://www.fredlaw.com/articles/energy/energy_0902_day_alm.html|publisher=Fredrikson & Byron, P.A.|accessdate=24 March 2011|author2=Daniel Yarano }}</ref>\n\nAlong with these advancements in policy, $1.64 billion was allocated for renewable energy, with $93 million for wind energy projects.<ref name=Energy.gov>{{cite web|last=Department of Energy|title=Renewable Energy|url=https://www.energy.gov/recovery/renewableenergy.htm|accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref> $45 million will go towards wind turbine drivetrain R&D and testing, $14 million for technology development, $24 million for wind power research and development, and $10 million for the National Wind Technology Center.

Wind Power development in the United States has shown a great dependence on the PTC. The wind industry has experienced growth during the years leading up to the expiration of the PTC and a dramatic decrease in installed wind capacity in years where the PTC has lapsed. In 2003, 1687 MW of capacity were installed leading up to a lapse of the PTC in 2004. In 2004, only 400 MW of capacity were installed in the United States. With the PTC reinstated in 2005, 2431 MW of capacity were installed which was a record at the time for the United States.<ref name=\"ucsusa.org\"/> The PTC allowed for the United States to lead the world in wind power additions in 2005 and 2006 with 16% of the worldwide capacity being installed in 2006 coming from the United States.<ref name=\"Wiser 2007\" /> The planning and permitting process for wind energy can take up to two years. With short-term extensions of the PTC, big investments from companies for research and development are less likely to occur.<ref name=\"ucsusa.org\"/> The current trend of short-term extensions of the Production Tax Credit have led to a boom and bust cycle of short-term planning and low number of investments. As the PTC expires many investors hurry to finish projects thus producing smaller capacity installations and creating higher electricity costs.<ref>{{cite web |last=Steve |first=Jaime |title=Wind Energy Production Tax Credit (PTC) |url=http://api.ning.com/files/7u1eapyLI6hnmNvAavydPtHsp1Pq7zgvVs7G*NV6*0z3t17f00hykx-XoG2K1y*xxyffGPjpIjgsMEFmH1siJU3GViiYep3i/AWEAWindEnergyProductionTaxCreditFactSheet.pdf |publisher=American Wind Energy Association |accessdate=21 September 2012}}</ref> Longer term Production Tax Credit policy would stimulate low-cost wind development and establish a more stable policy for wind development. Having short-term extensions on the PTC can potentially slow wind development, raise costs, require a greater reliance on foreign manufacturing, produce transmission issues, and most importantly can reduce the amount of research and development of wind energy.<ref name=\"Wiser 2007\"/> The world energy council has estimated that new wind capacity worldwide will amount to $150 to $400 billion in new business over the next twenty years.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Anderson |first=Heidi |title=The Federal Production Tax Credit: Will Its Expiration Mean the End of the United States Wind Industry? |journal=The Environmental Law Reporter |year=2003 |accessdate=16 April 2011 |url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/jmulibrary/docDetail.action?docID}}</ref> The 2015 extension is expected to add $35 billion of investment for 20 Gigawatts of wind power.

The PTC provides a 2.1 cent per kilowatt-hour benefit for the first ten years of a renewable energy facility's operation. A second incentive of PTC is wind developers can receive a 30% Investment Tax Credit(ITC) in place of the Production Tax Credit. This only applied if the projects were placed in service between 2009 and 2013.<ref>{{cite web |title=Production Tax Credit(PTC): Policy Recommendation |url=http://www.newwindagenda.org/ptc.html |publisher=American Wind Energy Association |accessdate=25 March 2011}}</ref> Lastly, a third incentive of the Production Tax Credit is providing grants that cover up to 30% of the renewable energy projects. This program is under the Department of Treasury and was effective for wind projects that were placed in service in 2009-2010 or the construction is begun by 2010 and plans to be in service before 2013.<ref name=\"Mark Bolinger\">{{cite web |title=PTC, ITC, or Cash Grant?

Most states in the US have energy policies to help support wind energy development.  State policies offer incentives and tax credits for both producers and consumers to make wind energy more affordable.  These tax credits are towards personal finances or property value.<ref name=\"Energy Bible\">{{cite web|title=Wind Energy for State Incentives|url=http://energybible.com/wind_energy/state_incentives.html|publisher=Energy Bible|accessdate=2011-03-14}}</ref> Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) and state grant programs are also used to increase wind energy usage in the United States.  By using these incentives, the US can make wind power more prominent to push for renewable energy sources, in an effort to lessen its dependence on foreign oil, protect the environment, and stabilize its energy costs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Helping You Change the World|url=http://www.ctcleanenergy.com/|publisher=Connecticut Clean Energy Fund|accessdate=2011-03-22}}</ref>  This section outlines different financial incentives available by state, and programs designed to increase the development and use of wind power.  It also displays state permitting and ordinance requirements, usually done on a county level, that are important to know before installing wind turbines.\n\n==Tax Credits==\nTax credits for renewable energy technology support the adoption of clean energy technologies by reducing net project costs to consumers, and encouraging market acceptance of clean energy practices.  They offer personal financial incentives and property value financial incentives for investing in renewable energy technologies like wind power.  They can be used to exempt wind energy equipment from sales taxes to reduce capital investment. They can also be used to reduce property taxes for wind power facilities, or to reduce federal income taxes for qualified tax-paying owners based on the capital investments incurred in wind project development.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|title=State Incentives for Wind Energy|url=http://energybible.com/wind_energy/state_incentives.html|publisher=Energy Bible|accessdate=2011-03-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Goodword|first=Jenna|title=Bottom Line on Renewable Energy Tax Credits|url=http://www.wri.org/publication/bottom-line-series-renewable-energy-tax-credits|publisher=World Resources Institute|accessdate=2011-03-23}}</ref> At the state level, the terms of credit, the amount of credit, and the cost of the credit differs between states. Using state incentives and tax credits helps meet state clean energy policy objectives.\n\nAccording to the Department of Energy, tax credits are generally more valuable than an equivalent tax deduction.

RPS programs create market demand for renewable energy supplies by aiming to stimulate the energy market to make clean energy economically competitive with conventional forms of electric power.<ref name=\"epa.gov\"/>  According to The Environmental Protection Agency in \"[http://www.epa.gov/chp/state-policy/renewable_fs.html Renewable Portfolio Standards: An Effective Policy to Support Clean Energy Supply]\", current states with RPS requirements mandate that 4% - 30%  of electricity be generated from renewable sources by a specified date, however, Renewable Portfolio Standards can have multiple goals.<ref name=\"epa.gov\"/>  Current RPS programs also include goals for local, regional, or global environmental benefits, local economic development, reducing the risks fossil fuel pricing, and advancing renewable energy technologies.<ref name=\"epa.gov\"/>\n\nThere are two types of Renewable Portfolio Standards: mandatory and voluntary.  As stated before, mandatory markets require the electricity service providers a minimum amount of renewable energy in their electricity supply while voluntary electricity markets allow the consumer to choose to surpass required policy and reduce the environmental impact of their electricity use further than required. Mandatory RPS programs are rarely applied to municipal utilities which are usually self regulated, but rather to investor-owned utilities and electric service providers.<ref name=\"epa.gov\">{{cite web|title=Renewable Portfolio Standards: An Effective Policy to Support Clean Energy Supply|url=http://www.epa.gov/chp/state-policy/renewable_fs.html|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref>  Voluntary markets help create renewable energy capacity that exceeds what mandatory markets contribute nationwide.<ref>{{cite web|title=Voluntary and Mandatory Markets|url=http://www.epa.gov/greenpower/gpmarket/markets.htm|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the EPA, based on knowledge gained from states with successful Renewable Portfolio Standards, designing and implementing an effective RPS program relies heavily on: support of state government, facilitated discussions with important stakeholders focusing on an appropriate RPS design, clear goals and objectives, and designing a clear and easy-to-use accounting system for compliance.  It is also important to conduct a mid-term performance review.  This should be done to identify the causes for any delay in meeting the RPS targets, and to make program changes as needed to meet the original goals of the RPS.<ref name=\"epa.gov\"/>  As of 2009 33 states including Washington DC had enacted successful Renewable Portfolio Standards, and currently there are 37.<ref name=\"epa.gov\"/> In 2003 RPS programs produced more than 2,300 megawatts (MW) of new renewable energy capacity.<ref name=\"epa.gov\"/> In February 2009, the Union of Concerned Scientists project stated that RPS will account for 76,750 megawatts (MW) of new renewable power by 2025.<ref name=\"epa.gov\"/>\n\nBelow is a table of the current states with  Renewable Portfolio Standards.

Wind energy project grants are offered primarily for the use in  the commercial, industrial, utility, education, and government sectors.<ref name=\"DSIRE: Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency\">{{cite web|title=Incentives/Policies for Renewables & Efficiency|url=http://www.dsireusa.org/|publisher=North Carolina State University, under NREL|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref> Applying for grants offers consumers a way to ease the investments costs in wind development projects. They can also be used to support research and development.  They are obtained by applying to the different state programs and are offered in the form of cash or tax credits.  Grant programs offer a way to pay for large portions of wind project initial costs and help support a national renewable energy system to be less dependent on traditional energy sources, and to protect the environment from future harm.\n\nBelow is a table listing available grant programs for renewable energy development, including wind power, by state.

Zoning was first implemented in the 1920s, and it is one form of a land-use law. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, \"having zoning requirements is the {{sic|principle}} means for local governments to implement land-use planning\".<ref name=\"Green\">{{cite web|last=Green|first=J.|title=Zoning for Distributed Wind Power \u2013 Breaking Down Barriers|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy05osti/38167.pdf|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|accessdate=2011-04-19}}</ref> The intent of establishing zoning laws is that land-use choices and regulation be done at a local level, staying as close as possible to the property owners affected by the installation.<ref name=\"Green\"/> However, according to the Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency, there are some states with permitting requirements and ordinances decided by state government.\n\nOften established ordinances do not address technologies like wind turbines. They also frequently have height restrictions; typically structures built taller than 35 feet require special use permits.<ref name=\"Green\"/> Wind turbines are rarely identified as an allowed use of property, therefore the development of a wind power system requires more than just a large investment.<ref name=\"Green\"/> Projects often need permits to monitor environmental impacts such as soil erosion and sedimentation, as well.  It is important to be aware of these requirements, and to look further into county policy when pursuing a wind project.\n\nBelow is a table of state policy for land use.

[[Wind power]] consumes no fuel or water, and emits no [[air pollution]], unlike most fossil fuel power sources. The energy consumed to manufacture and transport the materials used to build a wind power plant is equal to the new energy produced by the plant within a few months. While a wind farm may cover a large area of land, many land uses such as agriculture are compatible, with only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure made unavailable for use.<ref name=mar>[http://www.sustainabilitycentre.com.au/WindPowersStrength.pdf  Why Australia needs wind power] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101080556/http://www.sustainabilitycentre.com.au/WindPowersStrength.pdf |date=January 1, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThere are reports of bird and bat mortality at wind turbines, as there are around other artificial structures.

Investment in new transmission infrastructure is a costly and often economically unfeasible prospect. The expense of constructing new transmission access is such a high barrier to market entry that private companies have begun investing in transmission infrastructure with the hope of lowering the cost of new wind projects (see [[Atlantic Wind Connection]]).\n\nCongestion in existing lines also presents a threat to new wind facilities. Requests for transmission are often denied due to congestion. In 2006, the [[North American Electric Reliability Corporation]] reported 2,397 transmission request denials.<ref name=\"Electric Transmission: Approaches for Energizing a Sagging Industry\">{{cite journal|last=Abel|first=Amy|title=Electric Transmission: Approaches for Energizing a Sagging Industry|date=January 30, 2008|page=11|url=http://www.policyarchive.org/handle/10207/bitstreams/3136.pdf|accessdate=27 March 2011|id=RL33875}}</ref> The high frequency of transmission congestion also leads to long interconnection queues that are a required part of the development process.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wiser|first=Ryan|author2=Mark Bolinger |title=Annual Report on U.S. Wind Power Installation, Cost, and Performance Trends: 2007|date=May 2008|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nThe intermittent nature of wind power has conflicted with the original policies placed on power generators. Under these policies, electricity generators would be charged economic penalties if they did not meet their promised quotas. Because wind facilities do not have full control over the times and quantities of their electricity output, the [[FERC|Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)]] issued Order No. 890 to reform these generator imbalance charges.<ref name=\"Order No. 890: Preventing Undue Discrimination and Preference in Transmission Service\">{{cite journal|last=Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|title=Order No. 890: Preventing Undue Discrimination and Preference in Transmission Service|date=February 16, 2007|url=http://www.ferc.gov/whats-new/comm-meet/2007/021507/E-1.pdf|accessdate=27 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n==United States offshore wind policy==\nThe framework for offshore wind policy in the United States has been shaped since the late 1800s. Though not directly associated, the first policy regulation was stated in the [[Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899]], where the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] had authority over any construction in federal waters. It wasn't until 2005 that the authority changed, when the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]](Pub.L. 109-58) was enacted, and established the Secretary of the Interior to administer the federal water, within the federal regulatory agency of the [[Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement]] (BOEMRE), previously known as the Minerals Management Service (MMS).  The agency is \"responsible for overseeing the safe and environmentally responsible development of energy and mineral resources on the [[Outer Continental Shelf]].\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement |url=http://www.boemre.gov/ |work=The Department of the Interior |accessdate=17 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110421193410/http://boemre.gov/ |archivedate=21 April 2011 }}</ref>  Other policies that have affected offshore wind development in federal waters include the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1337), and the [[National Environmental Policy Act]](NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321-4347).  The only policy in state waters is the [[Coastal Zone Management Act]] of 1972 (Pub.L. 92-583).\n\n===History===\nThe first offshore wind project in the U.S. was proposed in 2001 by [[Cape Wind]].  The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] assumed the lead federal regulatory role under the [[Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899]], and issued a draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in 2004.  In 2004, the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE) produced \"[http://www.usowc.org/pdfs/final_09_20.pdf A Framework for Offshore Wind Energy Development in the United States].''  The report explored the potential and feasibility for installing wind turbines off the Mid Atlantic Coast, Gulf Coast, and in the Great Lakes.  The framework also discusses in great detail the major challenges that would lie ahead such as technology development, environmental compatibility, economic financial viability, regulation and government policies, and leadership coordination.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Framework for Offshore Wind Energy Development in the United States|url=http://www.usowc.org/pdfs/final_09_20.pdf|publisher=Department of Energy|accessdate=1 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]] (Public Law 109-58), the [[Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement]] (BOEMRE), assumed lead federal responsibility and initiated its own independent environmental review pursuant to the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA).   While the DOE focused on onshore wind development, several coastal states launched significant initiatives to attract, incentivize, and plan for wind development offshore.  In 2009, the U.S. Offshore Wind Collaborative (USOWC) released the paper \"[http://www.usowc.org/pdfs/PathForwardfinal.pdf U.S. Offshore Wind Energy: A Path Forward {{dead link}}].\"  This document presents a snapshot of U.S. offshore wind energy and serves as a resource for government, industry, and non-governmental stakeholders.<ref>{{cite web|last=Clarke|first=Steven|title=U.S. Offshore Wind Energy: A Path Forward|url=http://www.usowc.org/pdfs/PathForwardfinal.pdf|publisher=US Offshore Wind Collaborative|accessdate=1 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn October 6, 2010 the [[United States Department of the Interior]] Secretary [[Ken Salazar]] and Cape Wind Associates President Jim Gordon signed the nation's first lease for commercial wind energy development on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).  On February 7, 2011, Energy Secretary Chu announced [https://wind.energy.gov/pdfs/national_offshore_wind_strategy.pdf A National Offshore Wind Strategy].

The majority of states operate under parallel agencies that provide policy regulation.  Wind projects that would stretch between coastal states would require permitting consistent within each states coastal plan.  Permitting discrepancies for such projects may arise causing lengthy delays in construction of offshore wind farms.\n\n====Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA)====\nThe [[Coastal Zone Management Act]] of 1972 (Pub.L. 92-583, 86 Stat. 1280, enacted October 27, 1972, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1451\u20131464, Chapter 33) (see [[Coastal Zone Management Act]]) was enacted  in an effort to encourage states to establish coastal zone management plans.

The amendment states that the Secretary of the Interior may grant a lease, easement, or right-of-way on the outer Continental Shelf not otherwise stated in the Act.  Offshore wind related projects could now be given leases at the disposal of the Secretary of the Interior within the federal regulating agency of BOEMRE.  Prior to any lease agreements, all alternate energy projects must meet the standards of the National Environmental Policy Act.\n\n====National Environmental Policy Act====\nThe [[National Environmental Policy Act of 1969]] (42 U.S.C. 4321-4347) was enacted as the framework for environmental policy making in the U.S., with a goal of protecting, restoring, and enhancing the environment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Branch of Environmental Assessment|url=http://www.boemre.gov/eppd/compliance/nepa/index.htm|work=BOEMRE|publisher=Department of Interior|accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref>  The BOEMRE created documents for energy development planning to meet NEPA standards.

Qualifying for an ITC gives a credit of 30% on the cost of the property used for a wind facility. Cash grants eliminate the need for a partner to utilize tax credits. The carryback period was extended for the business credit, along with the bonus depreciation. Additional related incentives include 30% investment credits for manufacturers of renewable energy technologies, an increase in new clean renewable energy bonds to finance wind facilities, and funding towards advancing the electrical grid.<ref name=\"American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 - Wind Energy Provisions\">{{cite web|last=Mertens|first=Alexandra|title=American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 - Wind Energy Provisions|url=http://www.fredlaw.com/articles/energy/energy_0902_day_alm.html|publisher=Fredrikson & Byron, P.A.|accessdate=24 March 2011|author2=Daniel Yarano }}</ref>\n\nAlong with these advancements in policy, $1.64 billion was allocated for renewable energy, with $93 million for wind energy projects.<ref name=Energy.gov>{{cite web|last=Department of Energy|title=Renewable Energy|url=https://www.energy.gov/recovery/renewableenergy.htm|accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref> $45 million will go towards wind turbine drivetrain R&D and testing, $14 million for technology development, $24 million for wind power research and development, and $10 million for the National Wind Technology Center.

The PTC was extended in December 1999 until December 31, 2001. Once again the PTC expired in December 2001 and was not enacted again until March 2002 where it was then extended for another two years. At the end of 2003 the PTC expired for a third time until a one-year extension was granted in October 2004. With the 2004 extension, former President George Bush included the Production Tax Credit within a group of tax incentives for businesses. The PTC was extended through 2005 and also expanded the different types of renewable energies that would be included under the bill.<ref name=\"ucsusa.org\"/> The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (H.R. 6) modified the credit and extended it through the end of 2007. In December 2006, the PTC was extended for another year by the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (H.R. 6111). President [[Barack Obama]] extended the PTC by signing into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (H.R. 1). The Wind PTC was extended an additional two years, expiring the end of 2012, and was then extended as part of the [[United States fiscal cliff|fiscal cliff]] deal to expire at the end of 2013.<ref>{{cite news |journal=Forbes |last=Levitan |first=Dave |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davelevitan/2013/01/02/wind-power-tax-credit-survives-fiscal-cliff-deal/ |title=Wind Power Tax Credit Survives Fiscal Cliff Deal |date=January 2, 2013 |accessdate=July 9, 2013}}</ref> In late 2015 authorities provided a 5-year PTC, unlike the usual 1- or 2-year,<ref name=blooPTC>{{cite web|url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-17/what-just-happened-to-solar-and-wind-is-a-really-big-deal |title=Forget Oil Exports\u2014What Just Happened to Solar is a Really Big Deal|first1=Tom |last1=Randall |date=17 December 2015|publisher= |via=www.bloomberg.com}}</ref> but phased out by 2020 at a rate of 20% per year.

Wind Power development in the United States has shown a great dependence on the PTC. The wind industry has experienced growth during the years leading up to the expiration of the PTC and a dramatic decrease in installed wind capacity in years where the PTC has lapsed. In 2003, 1687 MW of capacity were installed leading up to a lapse of the PTC in 2004. In 2004, only 400 MW of capacity were installed in the United States. With the PTC reinstated in 2005, 2431 MW of capacity were installed which was a record at the time for the United States.<ref name=\"ucsusa.org\"/> The PTC allowed for the United States to lead the world in wind power additions in 2005 and 2006 with 16% of the worldwide capacity being installed in 2006 coming from the United States.<ref name=\"Wiser 2007\" /> The planning and permitting process for wind energy can take up to two years. With short-term extensions of the PTC, big investments from companies for research and development are less likely to occur.<ref name=\"ucsusa.org\"/> The current trend of short-term extensions of the Production Tax Credit have led to a boom and bust cycle of short-term planning and low number of investments. As the PTC expires many investors hurry to finish projects thus producing smaller capacity installations and creating higher electricity costs.<ref>{{cite web |last=Steve |first=Jaime |title=Wind Energy Production Tax Credit (PTC) |url=http://api.ning.com/files/7u1eapyLI6hnmNvAavydPtHsp1Pq7zgvVs7G*NV6*0z3t17f00hykx-XoG2K1y*xxyffGPjpIjgsMEFmH1siJU3GViiYep3i/AWEAWindEnergyProductionTaxCreditFactSheet.pdf |publisher=American Wind Energy Association |accessdate=21 September 2012}}</ref> Longer term Production Tax Credit policy would stimulate low-cost wind development and establish a more stable policy for wind development. Having short-term extensions on the PTC can potentially slow wind development, raise costs, require a greater reliance on foreign manufacturing, produce transmission issues, and most importantly can reduce the amount of research and development of wind energy.<ref name=\"Wiser 2007\"/> The world energy council has estimated that new wind capacity worldwide will amount to $150 to $400 billion in new business over the next twenty years.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Anderson |first=Heidi |title=The Federal Production Tax Credit: Will Its Expiration Mean the End of the United States Wind Industry? |journal=The Environmental Law Reporter |year=2003 |accessdate=16 April 2011 |url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/jmulibrary/docDetail.action?docID}}</ref> The 2015 extension is expected to add $35 billion of investment for 20 Gigawatts of wind power. Similar figures are expected for [[Solar power in the United States|solar power]], and combined the PTCs have a value of $25 billion.<ref name=blooPTC/>\n\n===Incentives of PTC===\n\nThere are several incentives that go along with a Wind Production Tax Credit. The PTC provides a 2.1 cent per kilowatt-hour benefit for the first ten years of a renewable energy facility's operation. A second incentive of PTC is wind developers can receive a 30% Investment Tax Credit(ITC) in place of the Production Tax Credit. This only applied if the projects were placed in service between 2009 and 2013.<ref>{{cite web |title=Production Tax Credit(PTC): Policy Recommendation |url=http://www.newwindagenda.org/ptc.html |publisher=American Wind Energy Association |accessdate=25 March 2011}}</ref> Lastly, a third incentive of the Production Tax Credit is providing grants that cover up to 30% of the renewable energy projects. This program is under the Department of Treasury and was effective for wind projects that were placed in service in 2009-2010 or the construction is begun by 2010 and plans to be in service before 2013.<ref name=\"Mark Bolinger\">{{cite web |title=PTC, ITC, or Cash Grant?

Most states in the US have energy policies to help support wind energy development.  State policies offer incentives and tax credits for both producers and consumers to make wind energy more affordable.  These tax credits are towards personal finances or property value.<ref name=\"Energy Bible\">{{cite web|title=Wind Energy for State Incentives|url=http://energybible.com/wind_energy/state_incentives.html|publisher=Energy Bible|accessdate=2011-03-14}}</ref> Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) and state grant programs are also used to increase wind energy usage in the United States.  By using these incentives, the US can make wind power more prominent to push for renewable energy sources, in an effort to lessen its dependence on foreign oil, protect the environment, and stabilize its energy costs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Helping You Change the World|url=http://www.ctcleanenergy.com/|publisher=Connecticut Clean Energy Fund|accessdate=2011-03-22}}</ref>  This section outlines different financial incentives available by state, and programs designed to increase the development and use of wind power.  It also displays state permitting and ordinance requirements, usually done on a county level, that are important to know before installing wind turbines.\n\n==Tax Credits==\nTax credits for renewable energy technology support the adoption of clean energy technologies by reducing net project costs to consumers, and encouraging market acceptance of clean energy practices.  They offer personal financial incentives and property value financial incentives for investing in renewable energy technologies like wind power.  They can be used to exempt wind energy equipment from sales taxes to reduce capital investment. They can also be used to reduce property taxes for wind power facilities, or to reduce federal income taxes for qualified tax-paying owners based on the capital investments incurred in wind project development.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|title=State Incentives for Wind Energy|url=http://energybible.com/wind_energy/state_incentives.html|publisher=Energy Bible|accessdate=2011-03-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Goodword|first=Jenna|title=Bottom Line on Renewable Energy Tax Credits|url=http://www.wri.org/publication/bottom-line-series-renewable-energy-tax-credits|publisher=World Resources Institute|accessdate=2011-03-23}}</ref> At the state level, the terms of credit, the amount of credit, and the cost of the credit differs between states. Using state incentives and tax credits helps meet state clean energy policy objectives.\n\nAccording to the Department of Energy, tax credits are generally more valuable than an equivalent tax deduction.  They reduce dollar-by-dollar as opposed to removing a percentage of a tax that is owed.<ref name=\"Consumer Energy Tax Incentives\">{{cite web|title=Consumer Energy Tax Incentives|url=https://www.energy.gov/taxbreaks.htm|publisher=The United States Department of Energy|accessdate=2011-04-18}}</ref>  They target and benefit: manufacturers, purchasers, building operators, and commercial, industrial, and residential customers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Clean Energy Tax Incentives -- Background|url=http://www.epa.gov/statelocalclimate/documents/pdf/4_20_06_Background_tax_incentives.pdf|publisher=STATE CLEAN ENERGY - ENVIRONMENT TECHNICAL FORUM|accessdate=2011-04-18}}</ref> Tax credits and incentives appear to be most effective when linked to other policies, which is important to consider when designing state tax incentive programs to most effectively leverage the tax credits in EPAct 2005.<ref name=\"Consumer Energy Tax Incentives\"/>\n\nBelow is a table that shows tax credits by state for wind development in the United States.

RPS programs create market demand for renewable energy supplies by aiming to stimulate the energy market to make clean energy economically competitive with conventional forms of electric power.<ref name=\"epa.gov\"/>  According to The Environmental Protection Agency in \"[http://www.epa.gov/chp/state-policy/renewable_fs.html Renewable Portfolio Standards: An Effective Policy to Support Clean Energy Supply]\", current states with RPS requirements mandate that 4% - 30%  of electricity be generated from renewable sources by a specified date, however, Renewable Portfolio Standards can have multiple goals.<ref name=\"epa.gov\"/>  Current RPS programs also include goals for local, regional, or global environmental benefits, local economic development, reducing the risks fossil fuel pricing, and advancing renewable energy technologies.<ref name=\"epa.gov\"/>\n\nThere are two types of Renewable Portfolio Standards: mandatory and voluntary.  As stated before, mandatory markets require the electricity service providers a minimum amount of renewable energy in their electricity supply while voluntary electricity markets allow the consumer to choose to surpass required policy and reduce the environmental impact of their electricity use further than required. Mandatory RPS programs are rarely applied to municipal utilities which are usually self regulated, but rather to investor-owned utilities and electric service providers.<ref name=\"epa.gov\">{{cite web|title=Renewable Portfolio Standards: An Effective Policy to Support Clean Energy Supply|url=http://www.epa.gov/chp/state-policy/renewable_fs.html|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref>  Voluntary markets help create renewable energy capacity that exceeds what mandatory markets contribute nationwide.<ref>{{cite web|title=Voluntary and Mandatory Markets|url=http://www.epa.gov/greenpower/gpmarket/markets.htm|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the EPA, based on knowledge gained from states with successful Renewable Portfolio Standards, designing and implementing an effective RPS program relies heavily on: support of state government, facilitated discussions with important stakeholders focusing on an appropriate RPS design, clear goals and objectives, and designing a clear and easy-to-use accounting system for compliance.  It is also important to conduct a mid-term performance review.  This should be done to identify the causes for any delay in meeting the RPS targets, and to make program changes as needed to meet the original goals of the RPS.<ref name=\"epa.gov\"/>  As of 2009 33 states including Washington DC had enacted successful Renewable Portfolio Standards, and currently there are 37.<ref name=\"epa.gov\"/> In 2003 RPS programs produced more than 2,300 megawatts (MW) of new renewable energy capacity.<ref name=\"epa.gov\"/> In February 2009, the Union of Concerned Scientists project stated that RPS will account for 76,750 megawatts (MW) of new renewable power by 2025.<ref name=\"epa.gov\"/>\n\nBelow is a table of the current states with  Renewable Portfolio Standards.

Zoning was first implemented in the 1920s, and it is one form of a land-use law. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, \"having zoning requirements is the {{sic|principle}} means for local governments to implement land-use planning\".<ref name=\"Green\">{{cite web|last=Green|first=J.|title=Zoning for Distributed Wind Power \u2013 Breaking Down Barriers|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy05osti/38167.pdf|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|accessdate=2011-04-19}}</ref> The intent of establishing zoning laws is that land-use choices and regulation be done at a local level, staying as close as possible to the property owners affected by the installation.<ref name=\"Green\"/> However, according to the Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency, there are some states with permitting requirements and ordinances decided by state government.\n\nOften established ordinances do not address technologies like wind turbines. They also frequently have height restrictions; typically structures built taller than 35 feet require special use permits.<ref name=\"Green\"/> Wind turbines are rarely identified as an allowed use of property, therefore the development of a wind power system requires more than just a large investment.<ref name=\"Green\"/> Projects often need permits to monitor environmental impacts such as soil erosion and sedimentation, as well.  It is important to be aware of these requirements, and to look further into county policy when pursuing a wind project.\n\nBelow is a table of state policy for land use.

[[Wind power]] consumes no fuel or water, and emits no [[air pollution]], unlike most fossil fuel power sources. The energy consumed to manufacture and transport the materials used to build a wind power plant is equal to the new energy produced by the plant within a few months.

Investment in new transmission infrastructure is a costly and often economically unfeasible prospect. The expense of constructing new transmission access is such a high barrier to market entry that private companies have begun investing in transmission infrastructure with the hope of lowering the cost of new wind projects (see [[Atlantic Wind Connection]]).\n\nCongestion in existing lines also presents a threat to new wind facilities. Requests for transmission are often denied due to congestion. In 2006, the [[North American Electric Reliability Corporation]] reported 2,397 transmission request denials.<ref name=\"Electric Transmission: Approaches for Energizing a Sagging Industry\">{{cite journal|last=Abel|first=Amy|title=Electric Transmission: Approaches for Energizing a Sagging Industry|date=January 30, 2008|page=11|url=http://www.policyarchive.org/handle/10207/bitstreams/3136.pdf|accessdate=27 March 2011|id=RL33875}}</ref> The high frequency of transmission congestion also leads to long interconnection queues that are a required part of the development process.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wiser|first=Ryan|author2=Mark Bolinger |title=Annual Report on U.S. Wind Power Installation, Cost, and Performance Trends: 2007|date=May 2008|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nThe intermittent nature of wind power has conflicted with the original policies placed on power generators. Under these policies, electricity generators would be charged economic penalties if they did not meet their promised quotas. Because wind facilities do not have full control over the times and quantities of their electricity output, the [[FERC|Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)]] issued Order No. 890 to reform these generator imbalance charges.<ref name=\"Order No. 890: Preventing Undue Discrimination and Preference in Transmission Service\">{{cite journal|last=Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|title=Order No. 890: Preventing Undue Discrimination and Preference in Transmission Service|date=February 16, 2007|url=http://www.ferc.gov/whats-new/comm-meet/2007/021507/E-1.pdf|accessdate=27 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n==United States offshore wind policy==\nThe framework for offshore wind policy in the United States has been shaped since the late 1800s. Though not directly associated, the first policy regulation was stated in the [[Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899]], where the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] had authority over any construction in federal waters. It wasn't until 2005 that the authority changed, when the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]](Pub.L. 109-58) was enacted, and established the Secretary of the Interior to administer the federal water, within the federal regulatory agency of the [[Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement]] (BOEMRE), previously known as the Minerals Management Service (MMS).  The agency is \"responsible for overseeing the safe and environmentally responsible development of energy and mineral resources on the [[Outer Continental Shelf]].\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement |url=http://www.boemre.gov/ |work=The Department of the Interior |accessdate=17 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110421193410/http://boemre.gov/ |archivedate=21 April 2011 }}</ref>  Other policies that have affected offshore wind development in federal waters include the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1337), and the [[National Environmental Policy Act]](NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321-4347).  The only policy in state waters is the [[Coastal Zone Management Act]] of 1972 (Pub.L. 92-583).\n\n===History===\nThe first offshore wind project in the U.S. was proposed in 2001 by [[Cape Wind]].  The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] assumed the lead federal regulatory role under the [[Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899]], and issued a draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in 2004.  In 2004, the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE) produced \"[http://www.usowc.org/pdfs/final_09_20.pdf A Framework for Offshore Wind Energy Development in the United States].''  The report explored the potential and feasibility for installing wind turbines off the Mid Atlantic Coast, Gulf Coast, and in the Great Lakes.  The framework also discusses in great detail the major challenges that would lie ahead such as technology development, environmental compatibility, economic financial viability, regulation and government policies, and leadership coordination.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Framework for Offshore Wind Energy Development in the United States|url=http://www.usowc.org/pdfs/final_09_20.pdf|publisher=Department of Energy|accessdate=1 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]] (Public Law 109-58), the [[Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement]] (BOEMRE), assumed lead federal responsibility and initiated its own independent environmental review pursuant to the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA).   While the DOE focused on onshore wind development, several coastal states launched significant initiatives to attract, incentivize, and plan for wind development offshore.  In 2009, the U.S. Offshore Wind Collaborative (USOWC) released the paper \"[http://www.usowc.org/pdfs/PathForwardfinal.pdf U.S. Offshore Wind Energy: A Path Forward].\"  This document presents a snapshot of U.S. offshore wind energy and serves as a resource for government, industry, and non-governmental stakeholders.<ref>{{cite web|last=Clarke|first=Steven|title=U.S. Offshore Wind Energy: A Path Forward|url=http://www.usowc.org/pdfs/PathForwardfinal.pdf|publisher=US Offshore Wind Collaborative|accessdate=1 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn October 6, 2010 the [[United States Department of the Interior]] Secretary [[Ken Salazar]] and Cape Wind Associates President Jim Gordon signed the nation's first lease for commercial wind energy development on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).  On February 7, 2011, Energy Secretary Chu announced [http://www1.eere.energy.gov/windandhydro/pdfs/national_offshore_wind_strategy.pdf A National Offshore Wind Strategy].  The strategy comes with $50 million of funding to be dispersed to technology development, removing market barriers, and next generation drivetrain.  The new strategy will pursue offshore opportunities in both federal and state waters.<ref>{{cite web|last=Beaudry\u2010Losique|first=Jacques|title=A National Offshore Wind Strategy|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/windandhydro/pdfs/national_offshore_wind_strategy.pdf|publisher=Department of Energy|accessdate=1 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Policies==\n\n===State Permitting===\nOffshore wind energy projects in state waters are subject to permitting based on the Coastal Zone Management Plans established in each state.  The majority of states operate under parallel agencies that provide policy regulation.  Wind projects that would stretch between coastal states would require permitting consistent within each states coastal plan.  Permitting discrepancies for such projects may arise causing lengthy delays in construction of offshore wind farms.\n\n====Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA)====\nThe [[Coastal Zone Management Act]] of 1972 (Pub.L. 92-583, 86 Stat. 1280, enacted October 27, 1972, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1451\u20131464, Chapter 33) (see [[Coastal Zone Management Act]]) was enacted  in an effort to encourage states to establish coastal zone management plans.  The plans would focus on preservation through protecting wildlife and natural resources.  Each state program must allocate preservation measures and permitted uses for land and water resources.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vann|first=Adam|title=Wind Energy: Offshore Permitting|url=http://www.cnie.org/nle/crsreports/10Sep/R40175.pdf|publisher=Congressional Research Service|accessdate=16 April 2011}}</ref>  The Act was amended through the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]] to investigate the most recent issues that face the coastal land and waters.  Congress listed several findings, including \"a national objective of attaining a greater degree of energy self sufficieny through expanding energy activity in the coastal region.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972|url=http://coastalmanagement.noaa.gov/about/czma.html#section302|publisher=Department of Commerce|accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Federal Permitting===\nOffshore wind energy projects in federal waters are subject to permitting based on lease agreements given by the Secretary of the Department of the Interior with [[BOEMRE]]. The President announced on April 22, 2009 that the Interior Department completed the Final Renewable Energy Framework to govern management of the Renewable Energy Program. \"The final rule establishes a program to grant leases, easements, and rights-of-way for orderly, safe, and environmentally responsible renewable energy development activities, such as the sitting and construction of offshore wind farms on the OCS as well as other forms of renewable energy such as wave, current, and solar.\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Renewable Energy |url=http://www.boemre.gov/ |work=Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement |accessdate=21 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110421193410/http://boemre.gov/ |archivedate=21 April 2011 }}</ref>\n\n====Rivers & Harbors Act====\nThe [[Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899]] stated that the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] was the governing body for construction of any structure in federal waters.  Any obstruction not approved by Congress would be prohibited from being constructed in any of the waters of the United States.  The Chief of Engineers had to recommend any structures built and then gain approval from the Secretary of War.<ref>{{cite web|title=Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899|url=http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/guidance/wetlands/sect10.cfm|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref> Although the Corps jurisdiction over offshore wind projects was never explicitly stated in the Act, Section 388 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 sought out to clear up any misconceptions.\n\n====Energy Policy Act of 2005====\nSection 388 of the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]] (Pub.L. 109-58) amends the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act ((43 U.S.C. 1337)).  The amendment states that the Secretary of the Interior may grant a lease, easement, or right-of-way on the outer Continental Shelf not otherwise stated in the Act.  Offshore wind related projects could now be given leases at the disposal of the Secretary of the Interior within the federal regulating agency of BOEMRE.  Prior to any lease agreements, all alternate energy projects must meet the standards of the National Environmental Policy Act.\n\n====National Environmental Policy Act====\nThe [[National Environmental Policy Act of 1969]] (42 U.S.C. 4321-4347) was enacted as the framework for environmental policy making in the U.S., with a goal of protecting, restoring, and enhancing the environment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Branch of Environmental Assessment|url=http://www.boemre.gov/eppd/compliance/nepa/index.htm|work=BOEMRE|publisher=Department of Interior|accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref>  The BOEMRE created documents for energy development planning to meet NEPA standards.  They prepare Environmental Assessments (EA) to determine if there are environmental consequences for a potential offshore project, and also Categorical Exclusion Reviews (CER) to verify if and EA or an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is necessary in the first place.\n\n==Offshore Leases==\n\n===Cape Wind===\n[[Cape Wind]] is the first offshore wind project in the U.S. to be granted a lease in federal waters after nearly 10 years of strenuous permitting. The Cape Wind Associates first applied for a lease in 2001 to the US Army Corps of Engineers, who at the time were responsible for granting leases under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899.  Immediately following, the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound was created to oppose the project.<ref name=\"energyboom.com\">{{cite news|title=History of the Cap Cod Offshore Wind Energy Project|url=http://www.energyboom.com/wind/history-cape-cod-offshore-wind-energy-project|accessdate=17 April 2011|newspaper=Energy Boom|date=28 April 2010}}</ref>  In 2002 the Corps announced that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) would be required from the Cape Wind Associates.  The EIS was submitted in 2004 stating that the project would bring many benefits to the people of Cape Cod and had positive environmental impacts.  After the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the Department of the Interior assumed main responsibility for granting a lease to the project and acknowledged the need for a new EIS.<ref name=\"energyboom.com\"/> In 2009, the new EIS was released to the public, and in April 2010 the project was approved.
