Classed as a [[toy dog]] breed because of its small size, the Pomeranian is descended from larger Spitz-type dogs, specifically the [[German Spitz]]. It has been determined by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale]] to be part of the German Spitz breed; and in many countries, they are known as the '''Zwergspitz''' (\"Dwarf-Spitz\").\n\nThe breed has been made popular by a number of royal owners since the 18th century. [[Queen Victoria]] owned a particularly small Pomeranian and consequently, the smaller variety became universally popular. During Queen Victoria's lifetime alone, the size of the breed decreased by half. Overall, the Pomeranian is a sturdy, healthy dog. The most common health issues are [[luxating patella]] and [[tracheal collapse]]. More rarely, the breed can have Alopecia X, a skin condition colloquially known as \"black skin disease\". This is a genetic disease which causes the dog's skin to turn black and lose all or most of its hair.<ref name=\"blackskin\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pommania.co.uk/blackskindisease.htm |title=BSD (Black Skin Disease) Alopecia X, Coat Funk |date= |work= |publisher=Pommania Pomeranians |accessdate=30 November 2009}}</ref> As of 2013, in terms of registration figures, since at least 1998, the breed has ranked among the top fifty most popular breeds in the US, and the current fashion for small dogs has increased their popularity worldwide.\n\n== Appearance ==\nPomeranians are small dogs weighing {{convert|1.36|-|3.17|kg|lb}} and standing {{convert|8|-|14|in|cm}} high at the [[withers]].<ref name=\"cunliffe\">{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Dog Breeds |last=Cunliffe |first=Juliette |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1999 |publisher=Parragon |location= |isbn=978-0-7525-8018-0 |page=262 |pages= |url=}}</ref> They are compact but sturdy dogs with an abundant textured coat with a highly plumed tail set high and flat.<ref name=\"dogs101\">{{cite book |title=Dogs: 101 Adorable Breeds |last=Hale |first=Rachael |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher=Andrews McMeel |location= |isbn=978-0-7407-7342-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/dogs101adorableb0000mcke/page/197 197] |pages= |url=https://archive.org/details/dogs101adorableb0000mcke/page/197 }}</ref> The [[Guard hair|top coat]] forms a ruff of fur on the neck, which Poms are well known for, and they also have a fringe of feathery hair on the hindquarters.<ref name=\"prem\">{{cite web |url=http://premierpoms.com/history.html |title=Pomeranian History |date= |work= |publisher=Premier Pomeranians |accessdate=4 December 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715113622/http://premierpoms.com/history.html |archive-date=15 July 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe earliest examples of the breed were white or occasionally brown or black.

Combinations such as brindle merle or liver merle are not accepted in the breed standard.

While grooming is not difficult, breeders recommend that it be done daily to maintain the quality of the coat and because of its thickness and the constant shedding, with trimming every 1\u20132 months.

In 1767, [[Queen Charlotte]], [[Queen-consort]] of King [[George III of England]], brought two Pomeranians to England.\n\nNamed Phoebe and Mercury, the dogs were depicted in paintings by Sir [[Thomas Gainsborough]].

One of her favoured dogs was a comparatively small red sable Pomeranian which she possibly named \"Windsor's Marco\" and was reported to weigh only {{convert|12|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.

Classed as a [[toy dog]] breed because of its small size, the Pomeranian is descended from larger Spitz-type dogs, specifically the [[German Spitz]]. It has been determined by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale]] to be part of the German Spitz breed; and in many countries, they are known as the '''Zwergspitz''' (\"Dwarf-Spitz\").\n\nThe breed has been made popular by a number of royal owners since the 18th century. [[Queen Victoria]] owned a particularly small Pomeranian and consequently, the smaller variety became universally popular. During Queen Victoria's lifetime alone, the size of the breed decreased by half. Overall, the Pomeranian is a sturdy, healthy dog. The most common health issues are [[luxating patella]] and [[tracheal collapse]]. More rarely, the breed can have Alopecia X, a skin condition colloquially known as \"black skin disease\". This is a genetic disease which causes the dog's skin to turn black and lose all or most of its hair.<ref name=\"blackskin\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pommania.co.uk/blackskindisease.htm |title=BSD (Black Skin Disease) Alopecia X, Coat Funk |date= |work= |publisher=Pommania Pomeranians |accessdate=30 November 2009}}</ref> As of 2013, in terms of registration figures, since at least 1998, the breed has ranked among the top fifty most popular breeds in the US, and the current fashion for small dogs has increased their popularity worldwide.\n\n== Appearance ==\nPomeranians are small dogs weighing {{convert|1.36|-|3.17|kg|lb}} and standing {{convert|8|-|14|in|cm}} high at the [[withers]].<ref name=\"cunliffe\">{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Dog Breeds |last=Cunliffe |first=Juliette |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1999 |publisher=Parragon |location= |isbn=978-0-7525-8018-0 |page=262 |pages= |url=}}</ref> They are compact but sturdy dogs with an abundant textured coat with a highly plumed tail set high and flat.<ref name=\"dogs101\">{{cite book |title=Dogs: 101 Adorable Breeds |last=Hale |first=Rachael |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher=Andrews McMeel |location= |isbn=978-0-7407-7342-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/dogs101adorableb0000mcke/page/197 197] |pages= |url=https://archive.org/details/dogs101adorableb0000mcke/page/197 }}</ref> The [[Guard hair|top coat]] forms a ruff of fur on the neck, which Poms are well known for, and they also have a fringe of feathery hair on the hindquarters.<ref name=\"prem\">{{cite web |url=http://premierpoms.com/history.html |title=Pomeranian History |date= |work= |publisher=Premier Pomeranians |accessdate=4 December 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715113622/http://premierpoms.com/history.html |archive-date=15 July 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe earliest examples of the breed were white or occasionally brown or black.

Under the strong mayor-council government, the mayor serves as the executive officer of the city.

[[City council]] members, who also have a three-term limit, are elected from eleven districts in the city, along with five at-large council members, who represent the entire city. Term limits with the City of Houston are absolute \u2013 past elected officeholders are prohibited from campaigning for their former council positions (which includes the mayor and city controller). The current [[mayor of Houston]] is [[Sylvester Turner]].\n\nThe city council lineup was based on a U.S. Justice Department mandate which took effect in 1979. Under the current city charter, when the population in the Houston city limits passed 2.2 million residents, the nine-member city council districts expanded to include two more city council districts.<ref>[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/4106814.html City Council may grow by two seats].

Brown]] denounced the [[term limit]]s, saying they prevented incumbents from gaining enough experience in city government. A proposal to double the current two-year term of office has been debated&mdash;as of 2005, several candidates for the city council have brought up the issue of whether term limits should be amended or eliminated. Some elected officials from the Greater Houston area within the [[Texas Legislature]]&mdash;primarily [[Garnet Coleman]] and Sylvester Turner&mdash;have also spoken out against term limits.  In 2010, a term limits review commission appointed by former mayor Bill White called for amending the city charter on extending term limits where elected officials could serve two four-year terms; the proposal failed 8.18.10 after the Houston City Council voted 7\u20137. The November 3, 2015 City of Houston municipal elections a referendum on the voter ballot have amended the term limit law where elected officials can serve two four-year terms - this measure does not abolish term limits nor have a reeligibility provision for past elected officeholders who served their full tenure under the 1991 term limit ordinance. Incumbents who have won re-election during the 2015 election under the three-term rule - those who served 2 are granted an additional 4 years while a freshman councilmember are granted their 2 additional terms - this means that some elected officials can hold up to 10 years in office (if a freshman councilmember who served during their 2014-16 term) or 8 years in office (for those elected in 2011 and re-elected to their final term).\n\nHouston is considered to be a politically divided city whose balance of power often sways between Republicans and Democrats. All City of Houston elected officials run on non-partisan ballots but may have declared allegiances to a political party. The city has elected ({{as of|2017|lc=y}}) [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] mayors since 1982 but the city council has been much more divided. The affluent western-central portions of Houston&mdash;such as River Oaks and the Memorial/Spring Branch area, as well as master planned communities of Kingwood and Clear Lake City&mdash;consistently vote Republican, while many of the inner city areas, Neartown, and [[Alief, Houston|Alief]]&mdash;are heavily Democratic. According to the 2005 Houston Area Survey, 68&nbsp;percent of non-Hispanic whites in Harris County are declared or favor [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] while 89 percent of non-Hispanic blacks in the area are declared or favor Democrats.

[[Houston]] was founded in 1836 and incorporated in 1837. The city is the county seat of [[Harris County, Texas|Harris County]]. A portion of southwest Houston extends into [[Fort Bend County, Texas|Fort&nbsp;Bend County]] and a small portion in the northeast extends into [[Montgomery County, Texas|Montgomery County]].\n\nThe city of Houston has a strong [[mayor\u2013council government]].

Under the strong mayor-council government, the mayor serves as the executive officer of the city. As the city's chief administrator and official representative, the mayor is responsible for the general management of the city and for seeing that all laws and [[local ordinance|ordinance]]s are enforced.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\n[[Image:HoustonCityHall DANIEL2986.jpg|thumb|left|[[Houston City Hall]]]]\n\nAs the result of a 1991 [[referendum]] in Houston, the two-year term was amended to elected officials who can serve up to three terms until 2015 where the three-term limit and two-year terms were replaced with a two four-year terms \u2013 a [[mayor]] is elected for a four-year term (previously the mayor, controller, and councilmembers are elected to a two-year term prior to the November 3, 2015 city elections), and can be elected to as many as two consecutive terms. [[City council]] members, who also have a three-term limit, are elected from eleven districts in the city, along with five at-large council members, who represent the entire city. Term limits with the City of Houston are absolute \u2013 past elected officeholders are prohibited from campaigning for their former council positions (which includes the mayor and city controller). The current [[mayor of Houston]] is [[Sylvester Turner]].\n\nThe city council lineup was based on a U.S. Justice Department mandate which took effect in 1979. Under the current city charter, when the population in the Houston city limits passed 2.2 million residents, the nine-member city council districts expanded to include two more city council districts.<ref>[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/4106814.html City Council may grow by two seats]. ''Houston Chronicle.''</ref> The municipal elections held on November 8, 2011, included the newly formed Districts J (located in the Greater Sharpstown area) and K (a section of Southwest Houston, Reliant Park, and Fort Bend County located within the Houston City Limits) where 2 candidates won over 50% of the vote. Houston is a [[devolution|home rule]] city and all municipal elections in the state of Texas are [[nonpartisan]].<ref>Ballotpedia, Municipal Elections in Houston, TX (2015). https://ballotpedia.org/Municipal_elections_in_Houston,_Texas_(2015)</ref>\n\nMany local [[Legislator|lawmakers]] have been impacted by the city's term limits. Several former city officials&mdash;Anthony Hall, [[Rodney Ellis]], [[Sheila Jackson Lee|Sheila Jackson-Lee]], Sylvia Garcia, Martha Wong, [[Chris Bell (politician)|Chris Bell]], [[Annise Parker]], [[Shelley Sekula-Gibbs]], Adrian Garcia, Ed Gonzalez, and Mike Sullivan&mdash;, chose to run for other elected positions once their terms expired or shortly before they were due to expire.\n\n[[File:HoustonCityHallAnnex.JPG|thumb|right|City Council Member offices located at the Margaret Helfrich Westerman City Hall Annex]]\n\nFormer mayor [[Lee P. Brown]] denounced the [[term limit]]s, saying they prevented incumbents from gaining enough experience in city government. A proposal to double the current two-year term of office has been debated&mdash;as of 2005, several candidates for the city council have brought up the issue of whether term limits should be amended or eliminated. Some elected officials from the Greater Houston area within the [[Texas Legislature]]&mdash;primarily [[Garnet Coleman]] and Sylvester Turner&mdash;have also spoken out against term limits.  In 2010, a term limits review commission appointed by former mayor Bill White called for amending the city charter on extending term limits where elected officials could serve two four-year terms; the proposal failed 8.18.10 after the Houston City Council voted 7\u20137. The November 3, 2015 City of Houston municipal elections a referendum on the voter ballot have amended the term limit law where elected officials can serve two four-year terms - this measure does not abolish term limits nor have a reeligibility provision for past elected officeholders who served their full tenure under the 1991 term limit ordinance. Incumbents who have won re-election during the 2015 election under the three-term rule - those who served 2 are granted an additional 4 years while a freshman councilmember are granted their 2 additional terms - this means that some elected officials can hold up to 10 years in office (if a freshman councilmember who served during their 2014-16 term) or 8 years in office (for those elected in 2011 and re-elected to their final term).\n\nHouston is considered to be a politically divided city whose balance of power often sways between Republicans and Democrats. All City of Houston elected officials run on non-partisan ballots but may have declared allegiances to a political party. The city has elected ({{as of|2017|lc=y}}) [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] mayors since 1982 but the city council has been much more divided. The affluent western-central portions of Houston&mdash;such as River Oaks and the Memorial/Spring Branch area, as well as master planned communities of Kingwood and Clear Lake City&mdash;consistently vote Republican, while many of the inner city areas, Neartown, and [[Alief, Houston|Alief]]&mdash;are heavily Democratic. According to the 2005 Houston Area Survey, 68&nbsp;percent of non-Hispanic whites in Harris County are declared or favor [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] while 89 percent of non-Hispanic blacks in the area are declared or favor Democrats. About 62&nbsp;percent Hispanics (of any race) in the area are declared or favor Democrats.<ref>Klineberg, Stephen.

The term refers to [[Cash (Chinese coin)|Chinese bronze coins]] used as currency during the dynastic periods of China and Vietnam.\nThe term ''h\u00e0o'' is a loanword from the Chinese ''h\u00e1o'' (Chinese: \u6beb), meaning a tenth of a currency unit.\nThe term ''xu'' comes from French ''sous'' meaning \"penny\".  \nThe sign is encoded {{unichar|20AB|DONG SIGN|html=}}.\n\n==History==\n===North Vietnam===<!-- This section is linked from [[North Vietnam]] -->\n{{Main|North Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng}}\n\nIn 1946, the [[Viet Minh]] government (later to become the government of North Vietnam) introduced its own currency, the \u0111\u1ed3ng, to replace the [[French Indochinese piastre]] at [[par value|par]]. Two revaluations followed, in 1951 and 1959; the first was at a rate of 100:1, the second at a rate of 1,000:1.\n\n===South Vietnam===\n{{Main|South Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng}}<nowiki> </nowiki>[[File:South Vietnam 500 Dong 1966.jpg|thumb|150px]]\n\nNotes dually denominated in piastres and \u0111\u1ed3ng were issued in 1953 for the [[State of Vietnam]], which evolved into South Vietnam in 1954. On September 22, 1975, after the [[fall of Saigon]], the currency in South Vietnam was changed to a \"liberation \u0111\u1ed3ng<nowiki>''</nowiki> worth 500 old Southern \u0111\u1ed3ng.\n\n===United Vietnam===\nAfter Vietnam was reunified, the \u0111\u1ed3ng was also unified, on May 3, 1978. One new \u0111\u1ed3ng equalled one Northern \u0111\u1ed3ng or 0.8 Southern \"liberation\" \u0111\u1ed3ng.\n\nOn September 14, 1985, the \u0111\u1ed3ng was revalued, with the new \u0111\u1ed3ng worth 10 old \u0111\u1ed3ng. This started a cycle of [[chronic inflation]] that continued through much of the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+vn0091) |title=LOC Country Study Vietnam. |publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-01-07}}</ref>\n\n==Coins==\n\nFor the earlier modern Vietnamese coins, please see [[North Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng]] or [[South Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng]].\n\n===First \u0111\u1ed3ng===\nIn 1978, aluminium coins (dated 1976), were introduced in denominations of 1, 2, and 5 h\u00e0o and 1 \u0111\u1ed3ng. The coins were minted by the Berlin mint in the [[German Democratic Republic]] and bear the state crest on the obverse and denomination on the reverse. Due to [[chronic inflation]], these coins lost all their relevant value and no coins circulated for many years after this series.\n\n===Second \u0111\u1ed3ng===\n\n====Commemorative Issues====\n\nCommemorative coins in copper, brass, copper-nickel, silver, and gold have been issued since 1986, but none of these have ever been used in circulation.\n\n====2003 Issue====\nThe State Bank of Vietnam resumed issuing coins on December 17, 2003.<ref name=\"official spec\"/>  The new coins, minted by the Mint of Finland, were in denominations of 200, 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 5,000 \u0111\u1ed3ng in either nickel-clad steel or brass-clad steel. Prior to its reintroduction, Vietnamese consumers had to exchange banknotes for tokens with a clerk before purchasing goods from vending machines. This was also to help the state ease the cost of producing large quantities of small denomination banknotes which tended to wear hard after every transaction. Many residents expressed excitement at seeing coins reappear after many years, as well as concern for the limited usefulness of the 200 \u0111\u1ed3ng coins due to ongoing inflationary pressures.<ref name=\"Curious Vietnamese sneak a peek at no-tear notes, coins\"/>\n\nSince the launch of the 2003 coin series, the State Bank has had some difficulties with making the acceptance of coins universal despite the partial discontinuation of smaller notes, to the point of some banks refusing coin cash deposits or the cashing in of large numbers of coins.

The term refers to [[Cash (Chinese coin)|Chinese bronze coins]] used as currency during the dynastic periods of China and Vietnam.\nThe term ''h\u00e0o'' is a loanword from the Chinese ''h\u00e1o'' (Chinese: \u6beb), meaning a tenth of a currency unit.\nThe term ''xu'' comes from French ''sous'' meaning \"penny\".  \nThe sign is encoded {{unichar|20AB|DONG SIGN|html=}}.\n\n==History==\n===North Vietnam===<!-- This section is linked from [[North Vietnam]] -->\n{{Main|North Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng}}\n\nIn 1946, the [[Viet Minh]] government (later to become the government of North Vietnam) introduced its own currency, the \u0111\u1ed3ng, to replace the [[French Indochinese piastre]] at [[par value|par]]. Two revaluations followed, in 1951 and 1959; the first was at a rate of 100:1, the second at a rate of 1,000:1.\n\n===South Vietnam===\n{{Main|South Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng}}<nowiki> </nowiki>[[File:South Vietnam 500 Dong 1966.jpg|thumb|150px]]\n\nNotes dually denominated in piastres and \u0111\u1ed3ng were issued in 1953 for the [[State of Vietnam]], which evolved into South Vietnam in 1954. On September 22, 1975, after the [[fall of Saigon]], the currency in South Vietnam was changed to a \"liberation \u0111\u1ed3ng<nowiki>''</nowiki> worth 500 old Southern \u0111\u1ed3ng.\n\n===United Vietnam===\nAfter Vietnam was reunified, the \u0111\u1ed3ng was also unified, on May 3, 1978. One new \u0111\u1ed3ng equalled one Northern \u0111\u1ed3ng or 0.8 Southern \"liberation\" \u0111\u1ed3ng.\n\nOn September 14, 1985, the \u0111\u1ed3ng was revalued, with the new \u0111\u1ed3ng worth 10 old \u0111\u1ed3ng. This started a cycle of [[chronic inflation]] that continued through much of the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+vn0091) |title=LOC Country Study Vietnam. |publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-01-07}}</ref>\n\n==Coins==\n\nFor the earlier modern Vietnamese coins, please see [[North Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng]] or [[South Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng]].\n\n===First \u0111\u1ed3ng===\nIn 1978, aluminium coins (dated 1976), were introduced in denominations of 1, 2, and 5 h\u00e0o and 1 \u0111\u1ed3ng. The coins were minted by the Berlin mint in the [[German Democratic Republic]] and bear the state crest on the obverse and denomination on the reverse. Due to [[chronic inflation]], these coins lost all their relevant value and no coins circulated for many years after this series.\n\n===Second \u0111\u1ed3ng===\n\n====Commemorative Issues====\n\nCommemorative coins in copper, brass, copper-nickel, silver, and gold have been issued since 1986, but none of these have ever been used in circulation.\n\n====2003 Issue====\nThe State Bank of Vietnam resumed issuing coins on December 17, 2003.<ref name=\"official spec\"/>  The new coins, minted by the Mint of Finland, were in denominations of 200, 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 5,000 \u0111\u1ed3ng in either nickel-clad steel or brass-clad steel. Prior to its reintroduction, Vietnamese consumers had to exchange banknotes for tokens with a clerk before purchasing goods from vending machines. This was also to help the state ease the cost of producing large quantities of small denomination banknotes which tended to wear hard after every transaction. Many residents expressed excitement at seeing coins reappear after many years, as well as concern for the limited usefulness of the 200 \u0111\u1ed3ng coins due to ongoing inflationary pressures.<ref name=\"Curious Vietnamese sneak a peek at no-tear notes, coins\"/>\n\nSince the launch of the 2003 coin series, the State Bank has had some difficulties with making the acceptance of coins universal despite the partial discontinuation of smaller notes, to the point of some banks refusing coin cash deposits or the cashing in of large numbers of coins. This has prompted laws requiring private and municipal banks to transact and offer services for coins and the full discontinuation of small denomination and cotton based notes.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n!colspan=11| 2003 Series<ref name=\"official spec\"/>\n|-\n!rowspan=2| Image !!rowspan=2| Value !!colspan=4| Technical parameters !!colspan=3| Description !!colspan=2| Date of\n|-\n!
