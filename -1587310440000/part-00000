It appears on the album ''[[Meat Is Murder]]'', and was the sole track from the album to be released as a UK promotional single. The song was composed by guitarist [[Johnny Marr]] and singer [[Morrissey]]. Marr has cited it as one of his favourite Smiths songs.<ref name=\"Trouss\u00e9\">{{cite journal|last=Trouss\u00e9|first=Stephen|title=Album by album: Johnny Marr|journal=Uncut|issue=February 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"Goddard 2004\">{{cite book|last=Goddard|first=Simon|title=The Smiths: Songs That Saved Your Life|edition=Second|year=2004|publisher=Reynolds and Hearn}}</ref>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\n\nThe song's narrative alludes to mockery of the lonely or suicidal, whom the narrator identifies with and champions in an exchange with another individual in a parked car. Disparity between literal and figurative meanings in some of the lyrics discourage a precise reading of the song.<ref name=\"Goddard 2004\"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Bret|first=David|title=Morrissey: Scandal & Passion|edition=First|year=2004|publisher=Robson Books|page=64}}</ref> In 1985, Morrissey disclosed to [[Melody Maker]] that the song was a response to journalistic mockery of his songwriting that dwelt \"on the unhappy side of life\" and to persistent attempts to expose him as a \"fake.\"<ref>{{cite journal|title=Trial by Jury|journal=Melody Maker|issue=16 March 1985}}</ref> In 1998, ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' reported rumours that the song's inspiration was an \"'intimate friendship' with a journalist around 1984\u20135\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Simpson|first=Dave|title=Manchester's Answer to the H-Bomb|journal=Uncut|issue=August 1998}}</ref>\n\nThe song's waltz-time related [[time signature|signature]] and Marr's rhythm guitar, with strident chord changes (as exemplified by the song's opening figure), lend the music a sweeping emotive feel. The song's [[Song structure (popular music)|structure]] is notable for its uncommon ABCBC form. Musically, the first verse is never repeated. According to Marr, the song's musical composition \"just fell through the roof. It was one of those times when the feeling just falls down on you from the ceiling somewhere and it almost plays itself.\"<ref name=\"Trouss\u00e9\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nFor many critics the song is the focal point of ''Meat Is Murder''. The music has been described as \"a monolithic ballad of tender yet imposing grace; a score of unreserved, raw beauty that Morrissey dutifully complemented\" and the song's coda as containing \"one of the most heart-rending vocal passages Morrissey has ever recorded.\"<ref name=\"Goddard 2004\"/> \n\nThe single entered and peaked in the [[UK Singles Chart]] at No. 49. The unusual timing of the release may have impacted on its modest chart position - 2 non-LP tracks, [[How Soon Is Now]] and [[Shakespears Sister|Shakespeare's Sister]] had already been released as singles since ''Meat Is Murder'' had come out. [[Rough Trade (shops)|Rough Trade]] owner [[Geoff Travis]] has said that the single was released on Morrissey's insistence: \"I said to him 'that's not a good idea' ... and he wouldn't have that and, being me, I said 'fine ...'\"<ref>King, Richard (2012). How Soon Is Now? The Madmen and Mavericks Who Made Independent Music 1975-2005. London: Faber & Faber. p.269</ref>  Other reasons for its relative lack of commercial success include the absence of new studio material on the B-side, and perceived fan displeasure at the 7\" version missing an instrumental coda; it was described by Jack Rabid of [[Allmusic]] as the first of the band's singles that \"wasn't a complete thrill to buy\".<ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{Cite web | last = Rabid | first = Jack | title = That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore Review | publisher = [[Allmusic]] | accessdate = 29 October 2012 | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=mw0001204566|pure_url=yes}}}}</ref> Additionally, the single suffered overall inadequate promotion, including a last-minute refusal by the band to perform on the UK television show ''[[Wogan]]''.<ref name=\"Goddard 2004\"/>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| headline = 7\" <small>RT186</small>\n| title1 = That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore\n| note1 = edit\n| length1 = 3:49\n| title2 = Meat Is Murder\n| note2 = live\n| length2 = 5:34\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| headline = 12\" <small>RTT186</small>\n| title1 = That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore\n| length1 = 4:57\n| title2 = Nowhere Fast\n| note2 = live\n| length2 = 2:31\n| title3 = Stretch Out and Wait\n| note3 = live\n| length3 = 2:49\n| title4 = Shakespeare's Sister\n| note4 = live\n| length4 = 2:12\n| title5 = Meat Is Murder\n| note5 = live\n| length5 = 5:34\n}}\n\n==Artwork and matrix message==\nThe artwork for the single is taken from a still of the 1964 Soviet film ''[[The Enchanted Desna]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title =Mozipedia: The Encyclopaedia of Morrissey and the Smiths|first =Simon|last =Goddard|date =2012|publisher =Random House|isbn =9781407028842|page =115}}</ref> It features a child actor, the uncropped original having also featured the child's on-screen mother.<ref>{{cite web|title=(Untitled)|url=http://www.wonderwall.it/speedway/cdtribute/cd.html|accessdate=31 August 2013}}</ref> According to Morrissey, \"The eyes are encrusted with hurt and premature wisdom\".<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Smash Hits|publisher=EMAP|volume=7|issue=16|pages=4\u20135}}</ref> The image was sourced from a 1965 issue of a specialist film magazine.<ref name=\"Goddard 2004\"/> A rejected sleeve design included an image of a dead chicken.<ref>Slee, Jo (2006).

It appears on the album ''[[Meat Is Murder]]'', and was the sole track from the album to be released as a UK promotional single. The song was composed by guitarist [[Johnny Marr]] and singer [[Morrissey]]. Marr has cited it as one of his favourite Smiths songs.<ref name=\"Trouss\u00e9\">{{cite journal|last=Trouss\u00e9|first=Stephen|title=Album by album: Johnny Marr|journal=Uncut|issue=February 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"Goddard 2004\">{{cite book|last=Goddard|first=Simon|title=The Smiths: Songs That Saved Your Life|edition=Second|year=2004|publisher=Reynolds and Hearn}}</ref>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\n\nThe song's narrative alludes to mockery of the lonely or suicidal, whom the narrator identifies with and champions in an exchange with another individual in a parked car. Disparity between literal and figurative meanings in some of the lyrics discourage a precise reading of the song.<ref name=\"Goddard 2004\"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Bret|first=David|title=Morrissey: Scandal & Passion|edition=First|year=2004|publisher=Robson Books|page=64}}</ref> In 1985, Morrissey disclosed to [[Melody Maker]] that the song was a response to journalistic mockery of his songwriting that dwelt \"on the unhappy side of life\" and to persistent attempts to expose him as a \"fake.\"<ref>{{cite journal|title=Trial by Jury|journal=Melody Maker|issue=16 March 1985}}</ref> In 1998, ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' reported rumours that the song's inspiration was an \"'intimate friendship' with a journalist around 1984\u20135\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Simpson|first=Dave|title=Manchester's Answer to the H-Bomb|journal=Uncut|issue=August 1998}}</ref>\n\nThe song's waltz-time related [[time signature|signature]] and Marr's rhythm guitar, with strident chord changes (as exemplified by the song's opening figure), lend the music a sweeping emotive feel. The song's [[Song structure (popular music)|structure]] is notable for its uncommon ABCBC form. Musically, the first verse is never repeated. According to Marr, the song's musical composition \"just fell through the roof. It was one of those times when the feeling just falls down on you from the ceiling somewhere and it almost plays itself.\"<ref name=\"Trouss\u00e9\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nFor many critics the song is the focal point of ''Meat Is Murder''. The music has been described as \"a monolithic ballad of tender yet imposing grace; a score of unreserved, raw beauty that Morrissey dutifully complemented\" and the song's coda as containing \"one of the most heart-rending vocal passages Morrissey has ever recorded.\"<ref name=\"Goddard 2004\"/> \n\nThe single entered and peaked in the [[UK Singles Chart]] at No. 49. The unusual timing of the release may have impacted on its modest chart position - 2 non-LP tracks, [[How Soon Is Now]] and [[Shakespeare's Sister]] had already been released as singles since ''Meat Is Murder'' had come out. [[Rough Trade]] owner [[Geoff Travis]] has said that the single was released on Morrissey's insistence: \"I said to him 'that's not a good idea' ... and he wouldn't have that and, being me, I said 'fine ...'\"<ref>King, Richard (2012). How Soon Is Now? The Madmen and Mavericks Who Made Independent Music 1975-2005. London: Faber & Faber. p.269</ref>  Other reasons for its relative lack of commercial success include the absence of new studio material on the B-side, and perceived fan displeasure at the 7\" version missing an instrumental coda; it was described by Jack Rabid of [[Allmusic]] as the first of the band's singles that \"wasn't a complete thrill to buy\".<ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{Cite web | last = Rabid | first = Jack | title = That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore Review | publisher = [[Allmusic]] | accessdate = 29 October 2012 | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=mw0001204566|pure_url=yes}}}}</ref> Additionally, the single suffered overall inadequate promotion, including a last-minute refusal by the band to perform on the UK television show ''[[Wogan]]''.<ref name=\"Goddard 2004\"/>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| headline = 7\" <small>RT186</small>\n| title1 = That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore\n| note1 = edit\n| length1 = 3:49\n| title2 = Meat Is Murder\n| note2 = live\n| length2 = 5:34\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| headline = 12\" <small>RTT186</small>\n| title1 = That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore\n| length1 = 4:57\n| title2 = Nowhere Fast\n| note2 = live\n| length2 = 2:31\n| title3 = Stretch Out and Wait\n| note3 = live\n| length3 = 2:49\n| title4 = Shakespeare's Sister\n| note4 = live\n| length4 = 2:12\n| title5 = Meat Is Murder\n| note5 = live\n| length5 = 5:34\n}}\n\n==Artwork and matrix message==\nThe artwork for the single is taken from a still of the 1964 Soviet film ''[[The Enchanted Desna]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title =Mozipedia: The Encyclopaedia of Morrissey and the Smiths|first =Simon|last =Goddard|date =2012|publisher =Random House|isbn =9781407028842|page =115}}</ref> It features a child actor, the uncropped original having also featured the child's on-screen mother.<ref>{{cite web|title=(Untitled)|url=http://www.wonderwall.it/speedway/cdtribute/cd.html|accessdate=31 August 2013}}</ref> According to Morrissey, \"The eyes are encrusted with hurt and premature wisdom\".<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Smash Hits|publisher=EMAP|volume=7|issue=16|pages=4\u20135}}</ref> The image was sourced from a 1965 issue of a specialist film magazine.<ref name=\"Goddard 2004\"/> A rejected sleeve design included an image of a dead chicken.<ref>Slee, Jo (2006).
