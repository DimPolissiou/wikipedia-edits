It receives an annual subsidy from [[Transport Canada]] to offset the cost of operating services connecting remote communities.\n\nVia Rail operates over 500 trains per week across eight Canadian [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] and {{convert|12500|km}} of track, 97 per cent of which is owned and maintained by other railway companies, mostly by [[Canadian National Railway]] (CN). Via Rail carried approximately 4.39&nbsp;million passengers in 2017, the majority along the ''[[Qu\u00e9bec City\u2013Windsor Corridor (Via Rail)|Corridor]]'' routes connecting the major cities of the [[Quebec City\u2013Windsor Corridor]], and had an on-time performance of 73 per cent.<ref name=\"ar2010\" />\n{{toc limit|3}}\n==History==\n{{Cleanup section|reason=Far too many headers|date=January 2018|talksection:Too many sections/headers}}\n\n===Background===\n{{See also|History of rail transport in Canada}}\n[[File:19680706 15 CN Rapido Pickering, ON.jpg|thumb|[[Canadian National Railway|CNR]] [[Rapido (train)|Rapido]] train cars in [[Pickering, Ontario|Pickering]], July 1968. In an effort to attract riders, new train cars were acquired by CN in the 1960s.]]\nYearly passenger levels on Canada's passenger trains peaked at 60 million during [[World War II]]. Following the war the growth of air travel and the personal automobile caused significant loss of [[mode share]] for Canada's passenger train operators. By the 1960s it was obvious to both [[Canadian National Railway]] (CN) and the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CP) that passenger trains were no longer economically viable. CP sought to divest itself of its passenger trains, but federal government regulators and politicians balked, forcing them to maintain a minimal service through the 1970s, with the government subsidizing up to 80 percent of losses. CN, being a [[Crown corporation]] at that time, was encouraged by the federal government and political interests to invest in passenger trains. Innovative marketing schemes such as ''Red, White, and Blue'' fares, new equipment such as scenic [[dome car]]s and [[Budd Rail Diesel Car|rail diesel car]]s, and services such as [[Rapido (passenger train)|Rapido]] and the [[UAC TurboTrain]] trains temporarily increased numbers of passengers, reversing previous declines.<ref name=\"nelligan\">{{cite book |title=Via Rail Canada: The first five years |first=Tom |last=Nelligan |publisher=[[Passenger Train Journal|PJT Publishing]] |year=1982 |isbn=0-937658-08-1}}</ref>{{rp|4\u20135}}\n\nThese increases proved temporary; by 1977, total passenger numbers had dropped below five million. The decline of passenger rail became a federal election issue in 1974 when the government of [[Pierre Trudeau]] promised to implement a nationwide carrier similar to [[Amtrak]] in the United States. Starting in 1976, CN began branding its passenger services with the bilingual name Via or Via CN. The Via logo began to appear on CN passenger locomotives and cars, while still carrying CN logos as well. That September, Via published a single timetable with information on both CN and CP trains, marking the first time that Canadians could find all major passenger trains in one publication. In 1977, CN underwent a dramatic restructuring when it placed various non-core freight railway activities into separate subsidiaries, such as ferries under [[CN Marine]], and passenger trains under Via Rail which was subsequently renamed Via Rail Canada.<ref name=\"nelligan\" />{{rp|6\u20139}}\n\n===Formation and early years===\n[[File:Discontinued VIA Rail train, Ontario Northland Station, Cochrane, Ontario.jpg|thumb|A Via Rail train at [[Cochrane station (Ontario)|Cochrane station]] in August 1978. Earlier that year, [[Canadian National Railway|CNR]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] passenger rail service were spun-off into Via Rail Canada.]]\nOn 12 January 1977, CN spun off its passenger services as a separate Crown corporation, Via Rail Canada. At its inception, Via acquired all CN passenger cars and locomotives. Following several months of negotiation, on 29 October 1978, Via assumed all CP passenger train operations and took possession of cars and locomotives. Passenger train services which were not included in the creation of Via Rail included those offered by [[BC Rail]], [[Algoma Central Railway]], [[Ontario Northland Railway]], [[Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway|Quebec North Shore & Labrador Railway]], various urban commuter train services operated by CN and CP, and remaining CN passenger services in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. At this time, Via did not own any trackage and had to pay right-of-way fees to CN and CP, sometimes being the only user of rural branch lines.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nVia initially had a tremendous variety of equipment \u2014 much of it in need of replacement \u2014 and operated routes stretching from [[Sydney, Nova Scotia]] to [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia]] and north to [[Churchill, Manitoba]]. Over 150 scheduled trains per week were in operation, including transcontinental services, regional trains, and [[Quebec-Windsor Corridor|corridor]] services.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nWhile Via remains an independent federal Crown corporation mandated to operate as a business, it is hindered by the fact that it was created by an [[Order in Council]] of the [[Privy Council of Canada|Privy Council]], and not from legislation passed by [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]]. Had Via been enabled by legislation, the company would be permitted to seek funding on the open money markets as other Crown corporations such as CN have done in the past. It is largely for this reason that critics say Via \u2014 like [[Amtrak]] in the United States \u2014 is vulnerable to federal budget cuts and continues to answer first to its political masters, as opposed to the business decisions needed to ensure the viability of intercity passenger rail service.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/via-rail-seeking-federal-budget-funding-for-1-3b-passenger-car-upgrade-in-toronto-montreal-corridor |author=Jason Fekete |title=Via Rail seeking federal budget funding for $1.3B passenger car upgrade in Toronto-Montreal corridor |publisher=National Post |date=February 29, 2016 |accessdate=March 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===1980s===\n[[File:Roger Puta shot VIA LRC-2 6903 at Port Hope, ON in October 1981 (34282991950).jpg|thumb|The [[LRC (train)|LRC]] in [[Port Hope, Ontario|Port Hope]], October 1981. Via Rail ordered the LRCs in the 1980s to replace its older train cars.]]\nGreater numbers of passengers would not be Via's saviour. In 1981, Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s government endorsed [[Minister of Transport (Canada)|Minister of Transport]] [[Jean-Luc P\u00e9pin]]'s plan which slash Via's budget, leading to a 40 percent reduction in the company's operations. Frequently sold-out trains such as the ''[[Super Continental]]'' (which reduced Via to operating only one transcontinental train, ''[[The Canadian]]'') and the popular ''[[Atlantic (passenger train)|Atlantic]]'' were discontinued.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nVia also sought to reduce its reliance on over 30-year-old second-hand equipment and placed a significant order with [[Bombardier Transportation]] for new high-speed locomotives and cars which would be used in its corridor trains. The [[LRC (train)|LRC]] (Light, Rapid, Comfortable) locomotives and cars used advanced technology such as [[Tilting train|active tilt]] to increase speed, but proved troublesome and took several years to work out problems (by 1990 only a handful of LRC locomotives remained in service which were subsequently retired by the arrival of the [[GE Genesis]] locomotives in 2001).{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nThe election of [[Brian Mulroney]]'s [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] government in 1984 brought an initial friend to Via, when several of Mulroney's commitments included rescinding the Via cuts of 1981 by restoring the ''[[Super Continental]]'' (under pressure from his western caucus), and the ''[[Atlantic (passenger train)|Atlantic]]'' (under pressure from his eastern caucus and then-[[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] mayor [[Elsie Wayne]]). Prime Minister Mulroney's government gave Via funding to refurbish some of its cars, and purchase new locomotives, this time a more reliable model from [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] diesel division.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nIt was during this time on 8 February 1986, that Via's eastbound [[Hinton train collision|''Super Continental'' collided with a CN freight train]] near [[Hinton, Alberta]], as a result of the freight train crew missing a signal light, resulting in 23 deaths.\n\nBy the late 1980s, inflation and other rising costs were taking their toll on federal budgets and in the Mulroney government's [[1989 Canadian federal budget|1989 budget]], Via again saw its budget slashed, surpassing even the 1981 cuts under Trudeau. \n\n===1990s===\n[[File:VIA 6501 with Train 109 at Regina, SK in May 1982 (32098880841).jpg|thumb|left|A Via [[EMD FP7|GMD FP7]] leads the ''[[Canadian (train)|Canadian]]'' in Calgary, May 1982. The ''Canadian'' was rerouted in the 1990s, ending service to several cities, like Calgary.]]\nMinister of Transport [[Beno\u00eet Bouchard]] oversaw the reduction in service on 15 January 1990, when Via's operations were reduced by 55 percent.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Services such as the ''[[Super Continental]]'' were again discontinued, along with numerous disparate rural services such as in [[Nova Scotia]]'s [[Annapolis Valley]] and [[Cape Breton Island]], [[western Canada]], and in the corridor. ''[[The Canadian]]'' was also moved from its home rails on CP to the northerly CN route (previously plied by the ''Super Continental''). The shift to the less-populated (and less scenic) route between [[Toronto]] and [[Vancouver]] severed major western cities such as [[Regina, Saskatchewan]] and [[Calgary, Alberta]] from the passenger rail network and flared western bitterness toward the [[Government of Canada]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nThe official justification for the rerouting was that the trains would serve more remote communities, but the concentration of ridings held by the Progressive Conservatives along the CN route attracted the charge that the move was chiefly political. [[Harvie Andr\u00e9]], one of Alberta's federal cabinet ministers who represented Calgary, stated publicly that he did not care if he never saw a passenger train again in his life.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nThe Mulroney cuts allowed Via to consolidate its fleet of cars and locomotives, resulting in a fleet of refurbished stainless steel (HEP-1 and HEP-2 rebuilds, for [[head end power]]) and LRC cars, as well as rationalizing its locomotive fleet with GM and Bombardier (LRC) units.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nVia was not spared from further cutbacks in [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]]'s [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] government elected in 1993. Minister of Finance [[Paul Martin]]'s first budget in 1994 saw further Via cuts which saw the popular ''[[Atlantic (passenger train)|Atlantic]]'' dropped from the schedule, focusing the eastern transcontinental service on the ''[[Ocean Limited|Ocean]]''. CP had sold off a large portion of track the ''Atlantic'' had operated on and, as Via at that time was only mandated to provide passenger services on tracks belonging to CN or CP, the route was discontinued.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} This move was seen as somewhat controversial and politically motivated as the principal cities benefiting from the ''Atlantic's'' service were [[Sherbrooke]], [[Quebec]] and [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], where the only two Progressive Conservative Party [[Members of Parliament]] in Canada were elected in the 1993 federal election in which Chr\u00e9tien's Liberal Party took power. The ''Ocean'' service which was preserved currently operates on track between Montreal and Halifax running through the lower St. Lawrence River valley and northern New Brunswick. The Minister of Transport in Chr\u00e9tien's government at the time, [[Doug Young (politician)|Douglas Young]], was elected from a district that included [[Bathurst, New Brunswick]], on the ''Ocean's'' route. A remote Via service to Quebec's [[Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula]], the ''[[Chaleur (passenger train)|Chaleur]]'' was also spared from being cut at this time, despite carrying fewer passengers than the ''Atlantic''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\n====Renaissance funding====\n[[File:VIA 66 with 901.JPG|thumb|right|Via Rail [[P42DC]] pulling [[LRC (train)|LRC]] coaches towards Montreal]]\nBy the late 1990s, with a rail-friendly Minister of Transport, [[David Collenette]], in office, there were modest funding increases to Via. Corridor services were improved with new and faster trains, a weekly tourist train, ''[[The Bras d'Or]]'', returned Via service to [[Cape Breton Island]] for the first time since the 1990 cuts, and a commitment was made to continue operating on [[Vancouver Island]], but western Canada continued to languish with the only service provided by the ''Canadian'' and a few remote service trains in northern BC and Manitoba.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nIn a significant new funding program dubbed \"Renaissance\", a fleet of unused passenger cars which had been built for planned ''[[Nightstar (train)|Nightstar]]'' sleeper services between locations in the United Kingdom and [[Continental Europe]] via the [[Channel Tunnel]] were purchased and adapted following the cancellation of the ''Nightstar'' project. The new \"[[Renaissance (railcar)|Renaissance]]\" cars were swiftly nicknamed ''d\u00e9plaisance'' (\"displeasure\") by French-speaking employees and customers, due to early problems adapting the equipment for Canadian use. Doors and toilets froze in cold Atlantic Canada temperatures, resulting in delays and service interruptions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.transport2000.ca/Hotlines/hl040130.htm |title=Transport 2000 Hotline |publisher=Transport2000.ca |date=January 30, 2004 |accessdate=March 10, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110420150023/http://www.transport2000.ca/Hotlines/hl040130.htm |archive-date=April 20, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> New diesel-electric [[GE Genesis|P42DC]] locomotives purchased from [[General Electric]] (GE) allowed the withdrawal of older locomotives, including remaining LRCs.

Critics of Martin's cuts claimed that he was in a distinct conflict of interest as his family through [[Canada Steamship Lines Inc.|Canada Steamship Lines]] and various subsidiary and affiliated companies had once had a significant investment in the [[Voyageur Colonial Bus Lines]], an intercity bus line in Quebec and eastern Ontario that is a key competitor of Via.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nRoute cuts under the Martin government included the withdrawal of the seasonal ''[[Bras d'Or (passenger train)|Bras d'Or]]'' tourist train, which ran for the last time in September 2004, and the Montreal-Toronto overnight ''[[Enterprise (Via Rail train)|Enterprise]]'', which was discontinued in September 2005. The Sarnia-Chicago ''[[International Limited (passenger train)|International]]'' was also discontinued in April 2004 by Amtrak. Via's portion of the route from Toronto-Sarnia remained in operation as Via was able to use their own equipment to operate the train.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\n====Sponsorship scandal====\n{{See also|Sponsorship scandal}}\nThe federal [[Auditor General of Canada|Auditor General]]'s report released publicly on 10 February 2004 showed what appeared to be a criminal misdirection of government funds intended for advertising to key Quebec-based supporters of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]]. Included in the Auditor General's report was the fact that Via was used as one of several federal government departments, agencies, and Crown corporations to funnel these illicit funds. Forced to act on the Auditor General's report due to its political implications, Martin's government suspended Via President [[Marc LeFran\u00e7ois]] on 24 February 2004, giving him an ultimatum of several days to defend himself against allegations in the report or face further disciplinary action.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nSeveral days later during LeFran\u00e7ois's suspension, former Via marketing department employee [[Myriam B\u00e9dard]] claimed she was fired several years earlier when she questioned company billing practices in dealing with advertising companies. (According to [[CBC News]], an arbitrator's report later concluded that B\u00e9dard had voluntarily left Via.) She was publicly belittled by Via CEO [[Jean Pelletier]] in national media on 27 February 2004. Pelletier retracted his statements but on 1 March, Pelletier was fired. By 5 March, after failing to defend himself adequately against the allegations in the Auditor General's report, LeFran\u00e7ois was fired as well.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\n====Increasing problems and reinstated funding====\n[[File:Thecanadiannearjasper.jpg|thumb|left|A Via [[EMD F40PH|F40PH-2]]D in [[Jasper]], February 2011.

This marked the completion of a procurement process launched following the 2018 federal budget, which allocated funding for the fleet replacement. During the request-for-proposals stage, Via had narrowed the potential suppliers down to Siemens, [[Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier]], [[Talgo]] and [[Stadler Rail]]. Siemens was ultimately selected after finishing first on the key criteria, which included the ability to deliver in a timely fashion, the quality of the product offering, and the price. The new fleet will consist of [[Siemens Charger|Siemens SCB-40]] locomotives hauling a combination of coaches, business-class cars, and cab cars from the [[Siemens Viaggio Comfort]] series to allow bi-directional operation. The trains will be built at Siemens plant in [[Sacramento, California]], and Siemens committed to including at least 20 percent Canadian content in the final product. The order includes an option for an additional 16 train sets to be exercised if the federal government approves Via's high-frequency dedicated-corridor project.<ref>{{cite web |title=VIA Rail places 989 million train order with Siemens |url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4755621/via-rail-places-989m-train-order-with-siemens-over-bombardier-for-key-rail-corridor/ |accessdate=December 19, 2018}}</ref> The first train set is to be delivered for testing by winter 2021, with the first sets in service by 2022 and all trains in service by 2024.

Via operates more than 500 trains per week from coast to coast. The sum of $369 million was earned from passenger revenues in 2018. Over 4.74 million passenger voyages were taken in 2018. An on-time ratio of 71 percent was achieved in that year. Over 3,115 persons were employed by Via by the end of 2018.\n\nVia president Yves Desjardins-Siciliano stated that the subsidy for passenger rail travel in Canada in 2015 was about 200 percent: for every $1 travellers spend on fares, Canada pays $2 in subsidy.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Taylor |first1=Roger |title=Via looks at expanding Atlantic service |url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/business/1321579-taylor-via-looks-at-expanding-atlantic-service |accessdate=November 20, 2015 |work=Chronicle Herald |publisher=Herald Limited |date=November 9, 2015}}</ref> \n\nAs of May 2019, the Chair of the Board of Directors is Fran\u00e7oise Bertrand, while the President and CEO is Cynthia Garneau; there are 11 other persons on the Board of Directors at the same year.

In an effort to attract riders, new train cars were acquired by CN in the 1960s.]]\nYearly passenger levels on Canada's passenger trains peaked at 60 million during [[World War II]]. Following the war the growth of air travel and the personal automobile caused significant loss of [[mode share]] for Canada's passenger train operators. By the 1960s it was obvious to both [[Canadian National Railway]] (CN) and the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CP) that passenger trains were no longer economically viable. CP sought to divest itself of its passenger trains, but federal government regulators and politicians balked, forcing them to maintain a minimal service through the 1970s, with the government subsidizing up to 80 percent of losses. CN, being a [[Crown corporation]] at that time, was encouraged by the federal government and political interests to invest in passenger trains. Innovative marketing schemes such as ''Red, White, and Blue'' fares, new equipment such as scenic [[dome car]]s and [[Budd Rail Diesel Car|rail diesel car]]s, and services such as [[Rapido (passenger train)|Rapido]] and the [[UAC TurboTrain]] trains temporarily increased numbers of passengers, reversing previous declines.<ref name=\"nelligan\">{{cite book |title=Via Rail Canada: The first five years |first=Tom |last=Nelligan |publisher=[[Passenger Train Journal|PJT Publishing]] |year=1982 |isbn=0-937658-08-1}}</ref>{{rp|4\u20135}}\n\nThese increases proved temporary; by 1977, total passenger numbers had dropped below five million. The decline of passenger rail became a federal election issue in 1974 when the government of [[Pierre Trudeau]] promised to implement a nationwide carrier similar to [[Amtrak]] in the United States. Starting in 1976, CN began branding its passenger services with the bilingual name Via or Via CN. The Via logo began to appear on CN passenger locomotives and cars, while still carrying CN logos as well. That September, Via published a single timetable with information on both CN and CP trains, marking the first time that Canadians could find all major passenger trains in one publication. In 1977, CN underwent a dramatic restructuring when it placed various non-core freight railway activities into separate subsidiaries, such as ferries under [[CN Marine]], and passenger trains under Via Rail which was subsequently renamed Via Rail Canada.<ref name=\"nelligan\" />{{rp|6\u20139}}\n\n===Formation and early years===\n[[File:Discontinued VIA Rail train, Ontario Northland Station, Cochrane, Ontario.jpg|thumb|A Via Rail train at [[Cochrane station (Ontario)|Cochrane station]] in August 1978. Earlier that year, [[Canadian National Railway|CNR]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] passenger rail service were spun-off into Via Rail Canada.]]\nOn 12 January 1977, CN spun off its passenger services as a separate Crown corporation, Via Rail Canada. At its inception, Via acquired all CN passenger cars and locomotives. Following several months of negotiation, on 29 October 1978, Via assumed all CP passenger train operations and took possession of cars and locomotives. Passenger train services which were not included in the creation of Via Rail included those offered by [[BC Rail]], [[Algoma Central Railway]], [[Ontario Northland Railway]], [[Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway|Quebec North Shore & Labrador Railway]], various urban commuter train services operated by CN and CP, and remaining CN passenger services in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. At this time, Via did not own any trackage and had to pay right-of-way fees to CN and CP, sometimes being the only user of rural branch lines.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nVia initially had a tremendous variety of equipment \u2014 much of it in need of replacement \u2014 and operated routes stretching from [[Sydney, Nova Scotia]] to [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia]] and north to [[Churchill, Manitoba]]. Over 150 scheduled trains per week were in operation, including transcontinental services, regional trains, and [[Quebec-Windsor Corridor|corridor]] services.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nWhile Via remains an independent federal Crown corporation mandated to operate as a business, it is hindered by the fact that it was created by an [[Order in Council]] of the [[Privy Council of Canada|Privy Council]], and not from legislation passed by [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]]. Had Via been enabled by legislation, the company would be permitted to seek funding on the open money markets as other Crown corporations such as CN have done in the past. It is largely for this reason that critics say Via \u2014 like [[Amtrak]] in the United States \u2014 is vulnerable to federal budget cuts and continues to answer first to its political masters, as opposed to the business decisions needed to ensure the viability of intercity passenger rail service.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/via-rail-seeking-federal-budget-funding-for-1-3b-passenger-car-upgrade-in-toronto-montreal-corridor |author=Jason Fekete |title=Via Rail seeking federal budget funding for $1.3B passenger car upgrade in Toronto-Montreal corridor |publisher=National Post |date=February 29, 2016 |accessdate=March 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===1980s===\n[[File:Roger Puta shot VIA LRC-2 6903 at Port Hope, ON in October 1981 (34282991950).jpg|thumb|The [[LRC (train)|LRC]] in [[Port Hope, Ontario|Port Hope]], October 1981. Via Rail ordered the LRCs in the 1980s to replace its older train cars.]]\nGreater numbers of passengers would not be Via's saviour. In 1981, Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s government endorsed [[Minister of Transport (Canada)|Minister of Transport]] [[Jean-Luc P\u00e9pin]]'s plan which slash Via's budget, leading to a 40 percent reduction in the company's operations. Frequently sold-out trains such as the ''[[Super Continental]]'' (which reduced Via to operating only one transcontinental train, ''[[The Canadian]]'') and the popular ''[[Atlantic (passenger train)|Atlantic]]'' were discontinued.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nVia also sought to reduce its reliance on over 30-year-old second-hand equipment and placed a significant order with [[Bombardier Transportation]] for new high-speed locomotives and cars which would be used in its corridor trains. The [[LRC (train)|LRC]] (Light, Rapid, Comfortable) locomotives and cars used advanced technology such as [[Tilting train|active tilt]] to increase speed, but proved troublesome and took several years to work out problems (by 1990 only a handful of LRC locomotives remained in service which were subsequently retired by the arrival of the [[GE Genesis]] locomotives in 2001).{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nThe election of [[Brian Mulroney]]'s [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] government in 1984 brought an initial friend to Via, when several of Mulroney's commitments included rescinding the Via cuts of 1981 by restoring the ''[[Super Continental]]'' (under pressure from his western caucus), and the ''[[Atlantic (passenger train)|Atlantic]]'' (under pressure from his eastern caucus and then-[[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] mayor [[Elsie Wayne]]). Prime Minister Mulroney's government gave Via funding to refurbish some of its cars, and purchase new locomotives, this time a more reliable model from [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] diesel division.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nIt was during this time on 8 February 1986, that Via's eastbound [[Hinton train collision|''Super Continental'' collided with a CN freight train]] near [[Hinton, Alberta]], as a result of the freight train crew missing a signal light, resulting in 23 deaths.\n\nBy the late 1980s, inflation and other rising costs were taking their toll on federal budgets and in the Mulroney government's [[1989 Canadian federal budget|1989 budget]], Via again saw its budget slashed, surpassing even the 1981 cuts under Trudeau. \n\n===1990s===\n[[File:VIA 6501 with Train 109 at Regina, SK in May 1982 (32098880841).jpg|thumb|left|A Via [[EMD FP7|GMD FP7]] leads the ''[[Canadian (train)|Canadian]]'' in Calgary, May 1982. The ''Canadian'' was rerouted in the 1990s, ending service to several cities, like Calgary.]]\nMinister of Transport [[Beno\u00eet Bouchard]] oversaw the reduction in service on 15 January 1990, when Via's operations were reduced by 55 percent.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Services such as the ''[[Super Continental]]'' were again discontinued, along with numerous disparate rural services such as in [[Nova Scotia]]'s [[Annapolis Valley]] and [[Cape Breton Island]], [[western Canada]], and in the corridor. ''[[The Canadian]]'' was also moved from its home rails on CP to the northerly CN route (previously plied by the ''Super Continental''). The shift to the less-populated (and less scenic) route between [[Toronto]] and [[Vancouver]] severed major western cities such as [[Regina, Saskatchewan]] and [[Calgary, Alberta]] from the passenger rail network and flared western bitterness toward the [[Government of Canada]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nThe official justification for the rerouting was that the trains would serve more remote communities, but the concentration of ridings held by the Progressive Conservatives along the CN route attracted the charge that the move was chiefly political. [[Harvie Andr\u00e9]], one of Alberta's federal cabinet ministers who represented Calgary, stated publicly that he did not care if he never saw a passenger train again in his life.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nThe Mulroney cuts allowed Via to consolidate its fleet of cars and locomotives, resulting in a fleet of refurbished stainless steel (HEP-1 and HEP-2 rebuilds, for [[head end power]]) and LRC cars, as well as rationalizing its locomotive fleet with GM and Bombardier (LRC) units.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nVia was not spared from further cutbacks in [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]]'s [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] government elected in 1993. Minister of Finance [[Paul Martin]]'s first budget in 1994 saw further Via cuts which saw the popular ''[[Atlantic (passenger train)|Atlantic]]'' dropped from the schedule, focusing the eastern transcontinental service on the ''[[Ocean Limited|Ocean]]''. CP had sold off a large portion of track the ''Atlantic'' had operated on and, as Via at that time was only mandated to provide passenger services on tracks belonging to CN or CP, the route was discontinued.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} This move was seen as somewhat controversial and politically motivated as the principal cities benefiting from the ''Atlantic's'' service were [[Sherbrooke]], [[Quebec]] and [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], where the only two Progressive Conservative Party [[Members of Parliament]] in Canada were elected in the 1993 federal election in which Chr\u00e9tien's Liberal Party took power. The ''Ocean'' service which was preserved currently operates on track between Montreal and Halifax running through the lower St. Lawrence River valley and northern New Brunswick. The Minister of Transport in Chr\u00e9tien's government at the time, [[Doug Young (politician)|Douglas Young]], was elected from a district that included [[Bathurst, New Brunswick]], on the ''Ocean's'' route. A remote Via service to Quebec's [[Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula]], the ''[[Chaleur (passenger train)|Chaleur]]'' was also spared from being cut at this time, despite carrying fewer passengers than the ''Atlantic''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\n====Renaissance funding====\n[[File:VIA 66 with 901.JPG|thumb|right|Via Rail [[P42DC]] pulling [[LRC (train)|LRC]] coaches towards Montreal]]\nBy the late 1990s, with a rail-friendly Minister of Transport, [[David Collenette]], in office, there were modest funding increases to Via. Corridor services were improved with new and faster trains, a weekly tourist train, ''[[The Bras d'Or]]'', returned Via service to [[Cape Breton Island]] for the first time since the 1990 cuts, and a commitment was made to continue operating on [[Vancouver Island]], but western Canada continued to languish with the only service provided by the ''Canadian'' and a few remote service trains in northern BC and Manitoba.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nIn a significant new funding program dubbed \"Renaissance\", a fleet of unused passenger cars which had been built for planned ''[[Nightstar (train)|Nightstar]]'' sleeper services between locations in the United Kingdom and [[Continental Europe]] via the [[Channel Tunnel]] were purchased and adapted following the cancellation of the ''Nightstar'' project. The new \"[[Renaissance (railcar)|Renaissance]]\" cars were swiftly nicknamed ''d\u00e9plaisance'' (\"displeasure\") by French-speaking employees and customers, due to early problems adapting the equipment for Canadian use.

Forced to act on the Auditor General's report due to its political implications, Martin's government suspended Via President [[Marc LeFran\u00e7ois]] on 24 February 2004, giving him an ultimatum of several days to defend himself against allegations in the report or face further disciplinary action.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nSeveral days later during LeFran\u00e7ois's suspension, former Via marketing department employee [[Myriam B\u00e9dard]] claimed she was fired several years earlier when she questioned company billing practices in dealing with advertising companies.

This marked the completion of a procurement process launched following the 2018 federal budget, which allocated funding for the fleet replacement. During the request-for-proposals stage, Via had narrowed the potential suppliers down to Siemens, [[Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier]], [[Talgo]] and [[Stadler Rail]]. Siemens was ultimately selected after finishing first on the key criteria, which included the ability to deliver in a timely fashion, the quality of the product offering, and the price. The new fleet will consist of [[Siemens Charger|Siemens SCB-40]] locomotives hauling a combination of coaches, business-class cars, and cab cars from the [[Siemens Viaggio Comfort]] series to allow bi-directional operation. The trains will be built at Siemens plant in [[Sacramento, California]], and Siemens committed to including at least 20 percent Canadian content in the final product. The order includes an option for an additional 16 train sets to be exercised if the federal government approves Via's high-frequency dedicated-corridor project.<ref>{{cite web |title=VIA Rail places 989 million train order with Siemens |url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4755621/via-rail-places-989m-train-order-with-siemens-over-bombardier-for-key-rail-corridor/ |accessdate=December 19, 2018}}</ref> The first train set is to be delivered for testing by winter 2021, with the first sets in service by 2022 and all trains in service by 2024.

Via operates more than 500 trains per week from coast to coast. The sum of $369 million was earned from passenger revenues in 2018. Over 4.74 million passenger voyages were taken in 2018. An on-time ratio of 71 percent was achieved in that year. Over 3,115 persons were employed by Via by the end of 2018.\n\nVia president Yves Desjardins-Siciliano stated that the subsidy for passenger rail travel in Canada in 2015 was about 200 percent: for every $1 travellers spend on fares, Canada pays $2 in subsidy.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Taylor |first1=Roger |title=Via looks at expanding Atlantic service |url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/business/1321579-taylor-via-looks-at-expanding-atlantic-service |accessdate=November 20, 2015 |work=Chronicle Herald |publisher=Herald Limited |date=November 9, 2015}}</ref> \n\nAs of May 2019, the Chair of the Board of Directors is Fran\u00e7oise Bertrand, while the President and CEO is Cynthia Garneau; there are 11 other persons on the Board of Directors at the same year.

The two locomotives and the first two cars continued on the main track, but the following cars took a diverging route onto an industrial track adjacent to the main track. Nine of the cars derailed and a farm supply building, as well as the industrial track were destroyed. Four occupants of the building escaped without injury prior to impact.
