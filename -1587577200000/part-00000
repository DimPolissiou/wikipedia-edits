''Khr\u00edsma'' came into Latin as ''{{lang|la|chrisma}}'', which appears in the works of [[Tertullian]]. This was adopted directly into [[Old English]] as ''{{lang|ang|crisma}}'', which developed into [[Middle English]] ''{{lang|enm|crisme}}'' and various related spellings.<ref name=oed/> In [[Old French]], the original Latin was conflated with ''{{lang|la|cramum}}'' (\"cream\"), developing into ''{{lang|fro|cresme}}'', which was also borrowed into [[Middle English]] around 1300 as ''{{lang|enm|creme}}'' and various related spellings.

Cyril taught that being \"anointed with the [[Holy anointing oil]] of God\" was the sign of a Christian, and a physical representation of having the Gift of the [[Holy Spirit]], and it retains this meaning in Catholicism and Orthodoxy today. He says, \"Having been counted worthy of this Holy Chrism, ye are called Christians, verifying the name also by your new birth. For before you were deemed worthy of this grace, ye had properly no right to this title, but were advancing on your way towards being Christians.\"(''On the Mysteries'' 3.5)<ref>[[Eric Segelberg]], \"The Benedictio Olei in the Apostolic Tradition of Hippolytus\", (Oriens Christianus 48, 1964)</ref>\n\n==Orthodox (Christianity)==\n[[File:Alavastr (16-17 c, Kremlin museum) by shakko 02.jpg|thumb|upright|Chrismarium used in Russia before the revolution of 1917.

The first sacrament that uses chrism, the sacrament of [[Chrismation]], is the second of the three Sacraments of Initiation ([[Baptism]], Chrismation, and Divine Eucharist).  For the Orthodox, Chrismation canonically must be administered in conjunction with baptism, except in a case of true necessity. Here the blessing of the bishop upon the chrism functions as a substitute for the direct imposition of hands.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}  Another use is in the [[consecration]] of church buildings, involving the anointing of the walls and of the altar table. Formerly, [[emperor]]s and [[monarch|kings]] of monarchies where Orthodoxy was the [[state religion]] would receive anointment with chrism at their [[coronation]].\n\n[[File:Stove for chrism.jpg|thumb|Stove and vessels for preparation of Chrism, 18th century (former Patriarchal residence, [[Moscow Kremlin]]).]]\n\n\nThe Orthodox Church makes chrism during [[Holy Week]] beginning on [[Holy Monday]] and culminating in the [[Divine Liturgy]] on [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]] when it is carried in the [[Entrance (Liturgical)|Great Entrance]] and placed upon the [[altar]].  It consists primarily of olive oil with the addition of a range of aromatic [[Essential oil|essence]]s, patterned after the anointing oil described in {{bibleverse||Exodus|30:22-33|}}.  Holy Myron is confected only by a bishop, without prejudice to particular law which reserves this power to the patriarch.

The Archon is given the ''Lention'', a silk \"towel\" or apron. Three copper cauldrons are used for the preparation: the largest contains olive oil, the smallest contains water and the aromatic ingredients and the middle contains wine, which allows the oil to boil without catching fire. The preparation involves several steps, some - such as the addition of [[musk]] and [[rose oil]] - performed by the Patriarch himself.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Once the Chrism is filtered and ready, it is consecrated for the final time and stored in silver vessels in the Chapel of [[Saint Andrew]], pending distribution.\n==Western Christianity==\n===Roman Catholicism===\n[[File:ChrismMass.jpg|thumb|left|A bishop pouring balsam into oil at Chrism Mass]]\n\nChrism is essential for the Catholic [[Sacraments (Catholic Church)|Sacrament]] of [[Confirmation (Catholic Church)|Confirmation/Chrismation]], and is prominently used in the sacraments of [[Baptism]] and [[Holy Orders]].  Those to be confirmed or chrismated, after receiving the [[laying on of hands]], are anointed on the head by the [[bishop]] or [[priest]].  In baptism, if the person baptized is not to be immediately confirmed or chrismated, the minister [[anointing|anoint]]s them with chrism.  Newly ordained priests are anointed with chrism on the palms of their hands, and newly ordained bishops receive an anointing of chrism on their foreheads. It is also used in the consecration of objects such as churches and altars.\n\nIn the ancient Liturgy prior to the reforms that followed the Second Vatican Council, that is still retained today as an [[extraordinary form of the Roman Rite]], employed by certain ecclesiastical communities, the use of Chrism during the administration of Holy Orders differs: in the older form of the Roman Rite, priests are anointed in the hands only with the [[oil of catechumens]], while bishops consecrated with the old ritual are anointed both in the head and in the hands with Chrism.\n\nBefore the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, chrism had to be used to [[consecrate]] [[paten]]s and [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]]s as well.  The [[Sign of the Cross]] would be made with the chrism on the interior parts the chalice and paten where the Eucharist would rest; the Cross would then be smeared to cover the entire interior parts.  The chalice and paten would need to be consecrated with the chrism again if they were re-gilded. This ritual could only be performed by a Bishop or a priest with the faculties to do so.  According to the new rubrics, a simple blessing suffices. However, it is still permitted that the bishop performs the consecration with chrism.\n\nChrism is made of [[olive oil]] and is scented with a sweet perfume, usually [[Balsam of Mecca|balsam]].  Under normal circumstances, chrism is consecrated by the [[bishop]] of the [[particular church]] in the presence of the [[presbyterium]] at the [[Chrism Mass]], which takes place in the morning of [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]]. The [[oil of catechumens]] and the [[Anointing of the Sick|oil of the sick]] are also blessed at this [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].\n\nThese holy oils are usually stored in special vessels known as [[Chrismarium|chrismaria]] and kept in a cabinet known as an [[ambry]]. When the oils are distributed to a priest for him to use in his ministry they are kept in a smaller vessel with three compartments, known as an \"oil stock\". There is also a type of oil stock that is shaped like a ring, to make the anointing easier. The \"jewel\" of the ring is a container with a removable lid.\n\nHoly Oils were also used, in the older form of the Roman Rite, for the anointing of kings during ceremonies of [[Coronation]]. Several local rites allowed for the use of Chrism in those coronation rites (e.g. in the pre-reformation English Coronation rite the anointing was with Chrism; Napoleon was anointed with Chrism by Pope Pius VII, etc). However, the general coronation rite of the Roman Liturgy, codified in the Roman Pontifical of Pope Clement VIII, prescribed the use of the oil of cathecumens for the anointing of kings. \n\n[[File:Reliquaireanciendelasainteampoule.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The original Holy Ampulla in its relic receptacle before 1793.]]\nThe '''[[Holy Ampulla]]''' or '''Holy [[Ampoule]]''' ('''''Sainte Ampoule''''' in [[French language|French]]) was a glass vial which, from its first recorded use by [[Pope Innocent II]] for the anointing of [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]] in 1131<ref>Le Goff, Jacques; et al. ''Le sacre royal \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de Saint-Louis d'apr\u00e8s le manuscrit latin 1246 de la BNF'' {{in lang|fr}}</ref> to the coronation of [[Louis XVI]] in 1774, held anointing oil for the [[coronations of the kings of France]]. In each French Coronation, one drop of this anointing oil was mixed with Chrism. Thus, French Coronations employed Chrism mixed with the oil of the Sainte Ampoule for the anointing of kings. The Sainte Ampoule was said to have been discovered by [[Hincmar]] the Archbishop of [[Reims]] when the sepulcher containing the body of [[Saint Remigius|Saint Remi]] was opened in the reign of [[Charles the Bald]] and identified with the baptism of [[Clovis I of France|Clovis I]], the first Frankish king converted to [[Christianity]]; it was kept thereafter in the [[Abbey of Saint-Remi]], Reims and brought with formality to the [[Cathedral of Notre-Dame, Reims]] at each coronation, where the emphasis was on the [[anointment]] rather than on the crowning.<ref>See Jean-Claude Bonne  2001, examining the coronation ''ordines'' from Charlemagne to [[Charles V of France|Charles V]], who commissioned a ''Livre du sacre'', as C.

Owing to this difference of practice, it is common for Anglican and Lutheran confirmation liturgies to refer to the use of chrism as an option. The liturgy of the [[Church of England]] states \"Oil mixed with fragrant spices (traditionally called chrism), expressing the blessings of the messianic era and the richness of the Holy Spirit, may be used to accompany the confirmation\".<ref>Common Worship - Christian Initiation, Church House Publishing 2006, {{ISBN|0-7151-2102-2}}, page 129.</ref> The confirmation liturgy of the Anglican Province of Southern Africa includes the rubric \"The Bishop may sign them on the forehead, using at his discretion the Chrism\".<ref>An Anglican Prayer Book, Church of the Province of Southern Africa, Collins 1989, {{ISBN|0-00-599180-3}}, page 393.</ref> The liturgy of the Igreja Lusitana (Anglican Church in Portugal) states at the point of confirmation: ''\"Os confirmandos ajoelham perante o Bispo. Este pode assinala-los na testa com o sinal da cruz, usando oleo proprio\"'' (\"The confirmands kneel before the Bishop. He may sign them on the forehead with the sign of the cross, using the proper oil\").<ref>Liturgia da Igreja Lusitana (Catolica Apostolica Evangelica), Igreja Lusitana 1991 (privately published), page 246.</ref>\n\nThe use of chrism in Anglican and Lutheran ordination liturgies is similarly presented as an option in most provinces. In the liturgy for the ordination of priests in the Church of England, for example, the instruction is: \"The bishop may anoint the palms of the hands of each newly ordained priest, saying 'May God, who anointed the Christ with the Holy Spirit at his baptism, anoint and empower you to reconcile and bless his people'.\"<ref>Common Worship - Ordination Services, Church House Publishing 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-7151-2130-6}}, page 50.</ref> There is a similar instruction for the ordination of Bishops, although they are anointed on the head, rather than the palms of the hands.<ref>Common Worship - Ordination Services, Church House Publishing 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-7151-2130-6}}, page 75.</ref>\n\nAn important and specific use of chrism is in the Anointing during the [[Coronation of the British monarch]]. In this part of the Service, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] anoints the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Sovereign]] on the head, hands and heart. This is considered to be the holiest rite of the Service, so much so that it is shielded from the congregation's view by a canopy of state. This is also why it was not filmed during the [[coronation of Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1953, nor was it photographed in 1937 during the [[coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth]]. It occurs just prior to the presentation of the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|Crown Jewels]] to the Sovereign, which is in turn followed by the actual Coronation.\n\nIts other notable use is in the consecration of church buildings, where it may be used to anoint the walls, the altar/table, and the place for reservation of the [[Eucharist]]ic sacrament for the sick.\n\nAs in other traditions, chrism is usually [[olive oil]] (although other plant oils can be used in cases when olive oil is unavailable) and is scented with a sweet perfume, usually [[Balsam of Mecca|balsam]].  Under usual circumstances, chrism is consecrated by the bishop of the [[particular church]] in the presence of the [[presbyterium]] at the [[Chrism Mass|Chrism Eucharist]], which takes place on [[Maundy Thursday]] or a day shortly before, where priestly ordination vows are often renewed also.  The oil of [[catechumen]]s and the [[Anointing of the Sick|oil of the sick]] are usually also consecrated at this liturgy. Practices vary for the blessing of the chrism, from interpolations within the Eucharistic Prayer, to specific prayers of consecration, used at the discretion of the minister.  Some Lutheran and Anglican [[liturgical book]]s, however, make provision for a pastor who is not a bishop (a presbyter) to consecrate chrism in time of need and in the absence of the bishop.\n\n===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===\n\n[[Latter Day Saint movement|Christians who are a part of the Latter-day Saint movement]], who consider themselves [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|restorationists]], also practice ritual anointing of the sick, as well as other forms of anointing.

Then another priesthood holder joins in, if available, and pronounces a \"sealing\" of the anointing and other words of blessing, as he feels inspired.

Cyril taught that being \"anointed with the [[Holy anointing oil]] of God\" was the sign of a Christian, and a physical representation of having the Gift of the [[Holy Spirit]], and it retains this meaning in Catholicism and Orthodoxy today. He says, \"Having been counted worthy of this Holy Chrism, ye are called Christians, verifying the name also by your new birth.

The first sacrament that uses chrism, the sacrament of [[Chrismation]], is the second of the three Sacraments of Initiation ([[Baptism]], Chrismation, and Divine Eucharist).  For the Orthodox, Chrismation canonically must be administered in conjunction with baptism, except in a case of true necessity. Here the blessing of the bishop upon the chrism functions as a substitute for the direct imposition of hands.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}  Another use is in the [[consecration]] of church buildings, involving the anointing of the walls and of the altar table. Formerly, [[emperor]]s and [[monarch|kings]] of monarchies where Orthodoxy was the [[state religion]] would receive anointment with chrism at their [[coronation]].\n\n[[File:Stove for chrism.jpg|thumb|Stove and vessels for preparation of Chrism, 18th century (former Patriarchal residence, [[Moscow Kremlin]]).]]\n\n\nThe Orthodox Church makes chrism during [[Holy Week]] beginning on [[Holy Monday]] and culminating in the [[Divine Liturgy]] on [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]] when it is carried in the [[Entrance (Liturgical)|Great Entrance]] and placed upon the [[altar]].  It consists primarily of olive oil with the addition of a range of aromatic [[Essential oil|essence]]s, patterned after the anointing oil described in {{bibleverse||Exodus|30:22-33|}}.  Holy Myron is confected only by a bishop, without prejudice to particular law which reserves this power to the patriarch.

The Archon is given the ''Lention'', a silk \"towel\" or apron. Three copper cauldrons are used for the preparation: the largest contains olive oil, the smallest contains water and the aromatic ingredients and the middle contains wine, which allows the oil to boil without catching fire. The preparation involves several steps, some - such as the addition of [[musk]] and [[rose oil]] - performed by the Patriarch himself.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Once the Chrism is filtered and ready, it is consecrated for the final time and stored in silver vessels in the Chapel of [[Saint Andrew]], pending distribution.\n==Western Christianity==\n===Roman Catholicism===\n[[File:ChrismMass.jpg|thumb|left|A bishop pouring balsam into oil at Chrism Mass]]\n\nChrism is essential for the Catholic [[Sacraments (Catholic Church)|Sacrament]] of [[Confirmation (Catholic Church)|Confirmation/Chrismation]], and is prominently used in the sacraments of [[Baptism]] and [[Holy Orders]].  Those to be confirmed or chrismated, after receiving the [[laying on of hands]], are anointed on the head by the [[bishop]] or [[priest]].  In baptism, if the person baptized is not to be immediately confirmed or chrismated, the minister [[anointing|anoint]]s them with chrism.  Newly ordained priests are anointed with chrism on the palms of their hands, and newly ordained bishops receive an anointing of chrism on their foreheads. It is also used in the consecration of objects such as churches and altars.\n\nIn the ancient Liturgy prior to the reforms that followed the Second Vatican Council, that is still retained today as an [[extraordinary form of the Roman Rite]], employed by certain ecclesiastical communities, the use of Chrism during the administration of Holy Orders differs: in the older form of the Roman Rite, priests are anointed in the hands only with the [[oil of catechumens]], while bishops consecrated with the old ritual are anointed both in the head and in the hands with Chrism.\n\nBefore the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, chrism had to be used to [[consecrate]] [[paten]]s and [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]]s as well.  The [[Sign of the Cross]] would be made with the chrism on the interior parts the chalice and paten where the Eucharist would rest; the Cross would then be smeared to cover the entire interior parts.  The chalice and paten would need to be consecrated with the chrism again if they were re-gilded. This ritual could only be performed by a Bishop or a priest with the faculties to do so.  According to the new rubrics, a simple blessing suffices. However, it is still permitted that the bishop performs the consecration with chrism.\n\nChrism is made of [[olive oil]] and is scented with a sweet perfume, usually [[Balsam of Mecca|balsam]].  Under normal circumstances, chrism is consecrated by the [[bishop]] of the [[particular church]] in the presence of the [[presbyterium]] at the [[Chrism Mass]], which takes place in the morning of [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]]. The [[oil of catechumens]] and the [[Anointing of the Sick|oil of the sick]] are also blessed at this [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].\n\nThese holy oils are usually stored in special vessels known as [[Chrismarium|chrismaria]] and kept in a cabinet known as an [[ambry]]. When the oils are distributed to a priest for him to use in his ministry they are kept in a smaller vessel with three compartments, known as an \"oil stock\". There is also a type of oil stock that is shaped like a ring, to make the anointing easier. The \"jewel\" of the ring is a container with a removable lid.\n\nHoly Oils were also used, in the older form of the Roman Rite, for the anointing of kings during ceremonies of [[Coronation]]. Several local rites allowed for the use of Chrism in those coronation rites (e.g. in the pre-reformation English Coronation rite the anointing was with Chrism; Napoleon was anointed with Chrism by Pope Pius VII, etc). However, the general coronation rite of the Roman Liturgy, codified in the Roman Pontifical of Pope Clement VIII, prescribed the use of the oil of cathecumens for the anointing of kings. \n\n[[File:Reliquaireanciendelasainteampoule.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The original Holy Ampulla in its relic receptacle before 1793.]]\nThe '''[[Holy Ampulla]]''' or '''Holy [[Ampoule]]''' ('''''Sainte Ampoule''''' in [[French language|French]]) was a glass vial which, from its first recorded use by [[Pope Innocent II]] for the anointing of [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]] in 1131<ref>Le Goff, Jacques; et al. ''Le sacre royal \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de Saint-Louis d'apr\u00e8s le manuscrit latin 1246 de la BNF'' {{in lang|fr}}</ref> to the coronation of [[Louis XVI]] in 1774, held anointing oil for the [[coronations of the kings of France]]. In each French Coronation, one drop of this anointing oil was mixed with Chrism. Thus, French Coronations employed Chrism mixed with the oil of the Sainte Ampoule for the anointing of kings. The Sainte Ampoule was said to have been discovered by [[Hincmar]] the Archbishop of [[Reims]] when the sepulcher containing the body of [[Saint Remigius|Saint Remi]] was opened in the reign of [[Charles the Bald]] and identified with the baptism of [[Clovis I of France|Clovis I]], the first Frankish king converted to [[Christianity]]; it was kept thereafter in the [[Abbey of Saint-Remi]], Reims and brought with formality to the [[Cathedral of Notre-Dame, Reims]] at each coronation, where the emphasis was on the [[anointment]] rather than on the crowning.<ref>See Jean-Claude Bonne  2001, examining the coronation ''ordines'' from Charlemagne to [[Charles V of France|Charles V]], who commissioned a ''Livre du sacre'', as C.

Owing to this difference of practice, it is common for Anglican and Lutheran confirmation liturgies to refer to the use of chrism as an option. The liturgy of the [[Church of England]] states \"Oil mixed with fragrant spices (traditionally called chrism), expressing the blessings of the messianic era and the richness of the Holy Spirit, may be used to accompany the confirmation\".<ref>Common Worship - Christian Initiation, Church House Publishing 2006, {{ISBN|0-7151-2102-2}}, page 129.</ref> The confirmation liturgy of the Anglican Province of Southern Africa includes the rubric \"The Bishop may sign them on the forehead, using at his discretion the Chrism\".<ref>An Anglican Prayer Book, Church of the Province of Southern Africa, Collins 1989, {{ISBN|0-00-599180-3}}, page 393.</ref> The liturgy of the Igreja Lusitana (Anglican Church in Portugal) states at the point of confirmation: ''\"Os confirmandos ajoelham perante o Bispo. Este pode assinala-los na testa com o sinal da cruz, usando oleo proprio\"'' (\"The confirmands kneel before the Bishop. He may sign them on the forehead with the sign of the cross, using the proper oil\").<ref>Liturgia da Igreja Lusitana (Catolica Apostolica Evangelica), Igreja Lusitana 1991 (privately published), page 246.</ref>\n\nThe use of chrism in Anglican and Lutheran ordination liturgies is similarly presented as an option in most provinces. In the liturgy for the ordination of priests in the Church of England, for example, the instruction is: \"The bishop may anoint the palms of the hands of each newly ordained priest, saying 'May God, who anointed the Christ with the Holy Spirit at his baptism, anoint and empower you to reconcile and bless his people'.\"<ref>Common Worship - Ordination Services, Church House Publishing 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-7151-2130-6}}, page 50.</ref> There is a similar instruction for the ordination of Bishops, although they are anointed on the head, rather than the palms of the hands.<ref>Common Worship - Ordination Services, Church House Publishing 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-7151-2130-6}}, page 75.</ref>\n\nAn important and specific use of chrism is in the Anointing during the [[Coronation of the British monarch]]. In this part of the Service, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] anoints the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Sovereign]] on the head, hands and heart. This is considered to be the holiest rite of the Service, so much so that it is shielded from the congregation's view by a canopy of state. This is also why it was not filmed during the [[coronation of Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1953, nor was it photographed in 1937 during the [[coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth]]. It occurs just prior to the presentation of the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|Crown Jewels]] to the Sovereign, which is in turn followed by the actual Coronation.\n\nIts other notable use is in the consecration of church buildings, where it may be used to anoint the walls, the altar/table, and the place for reservation of the [[Eucharist]]ic sacrament for the sick.\n\nAs in other traditions, chrism is usually [[olive oil]] (although other plant oils can be used in cases when olive oil is unavailable) and is scented with a sweet perfume, usually [[Balsam of Mecca|balsam]].  Under usual circumstances, chrism is consecrated by the bishop of the [[particular church]] in the presence of the [[presbyterium]] at the [[Chrism Mass|Chrism Eucharist]], which takes place on [[Maundy Thursday]] or a day shortly before, where priestly ordination vows are often renewed also.  The oil of [[catechumen]]s and the [[Anointing of the Sick|oil of the sick]] are usually also consecrated at this liturgy. Practices vary for the blessing of the chrism, from interpolations within the Eucharistic Prayer, to specific prayers of consecration, used at the discretion of the minister.  Some Lutheran and Anglican [[liturgical book]]s, however, make provision for a pastor who is not a bishop (a presbyter) to consecrate chrism in time of need and in the absence of the bishop.\n\n===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===\n\n[[Latter Day Saint movement|Christians who are a part of the Latter-day Saint movement]], who consider themselves [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|restorationists]], also practice ritual anointing of the sick, as well as other forms of anointing. Members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Church of Jesus Christ) consider anointing to be an [[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinance]].<ref name=\"613 Administering to the Sick\">\"[http://library.lds.org/nxt/gateway.dll/Curriculum/home%20and%20family.htm/gospel%20art%20picture%20kit.htm/600%20%20gospel%20in%20action.htm/613%20administering%20to%20the%20sick.htm 613 Administering to the Sick]{{dead link|date=July 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}\", ''LDS.org Gospel Topics.</ref>\n\nMembers of the Church of Jesus Christ who hold the [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek priesthood]] may use consecrated oil in performing the ordinance of [[Anointing of the Sick#Latter Day Saints|blessing of the \"sick or afflicted\"]], though oil is not required if it is unavailable.  The priesthood holder anoints the recipient's head with a drop of oil, then [[Laying on of hands|lays his hands upon that head]] and declares his act of anointing.  Then another priesthood holder joins in, if available, and pronounces a \"sealing\" of the anointing and other words of blessing, as he feels inspired.  Melchizedek priesthood holders are also authorized to consecrate any pure olive oil and often carry a personal supply in case they have need to perform a blessing.

Soon after that, he began to perform publicly and quickly built up a reputation as a \"freak of nature\", which inspired the famous montenegrin poet and TV personality Dragan Radulovi\u0107 to produce a documentary about him in 1993. He continued his studies at the [[Faculty of Music in Belgrade]] (class of S. To\u0161i\u0107), graduating in 2000, and further pursued them with [[Hubert K\u00e4ppel]] and Roberto Aussel at the [[Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik K\u00f6ln]] in Germany, where he graduated and received the \"Konzertexamen\" degree. During that time, he also received his master's degree at the [[Conservatorium Maastricht]] (the Netherlands), under the tutorship of [[Carlo Marchione]].\n\nGoran Krivokapi\u0107 did his first international competition (\"Petar Konjovic\" in Belgrade) in 1994. After winning it, he continued competing in the most prestigious international competitions and won a total of seventeen first prizes, making this number unique in the music world. Some of them are:\n\nXVI International Guitar Competition [[Andr\u00e9s Segovia]] in Almu\u00f1ecar (Spain - 2000),\nXXXIII [[Michele Pittaluga International Classical Guitar Competition]] (member of WFIMC) in Alessandria (Italy - 2000),\nXXIII International Guitar Competition Rene Bartoli in Aix-en-Provence (France)\nXXXII International Guitar Competition Fernando Sor in Rome (Italy - 2003),\nVII [[Alhambra International Guitar Competition]] in Alcoy (Spain - 2004),\nXXV International Guitar Competition Mauro Giuliani in Bari (Italy - 2004),\nXXII Guitar Foundation of America International Solo Competition in Montr\u00e9al (Canada - 2004),\nXXXI Dr. Luis Sigall International Competition for Musical Performance (member of WFIMC) in Vi\u00f1a del Mar (Chile - 2004).\n\nAs a soloist, Goran has performed with the Slovak Chamber Orchestra, Belgrade Philharmonic, Montenegro Symphony Orchestra, Montenegro Chamber Orchestra, Chilean Symphony Orchestra and Turin Philharmonic. He has given solo recitals and master-classes at guitar festivals, music festivals and concert seasons in Germany, Italy, Spain, Austria, Netherlands, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Luxembourg, Montenegro, Serbia, Greece, Turkey, USA, Canada, Mexico, South Africa and Chile.\n\nHis solo career has enjoyed extensive media coverage over the years. Several television documentaries were made about him (TV Montenegro, TV Arte, TV Politika) and he performed for and gave interviews to TV and radio stations such as RTS, RTCG, TVBK, FOX7, FMR...

The [[Sinoatrial node|SA node]] receives several different inputs and the  instantaneous heart rate or RR interval and its variation are the results of these inputs.\n\nThe main inputs are the [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] and the [[parasympathetic nervous system]] (PSNS) and [[humoral factor]]s. Respiration gives rise to waves in heart rate mediated primarily via the PSNS, and it is thought that the lag in the [[baroreceptor]] feedback loop may give rise to 10 second waves in heart rate (associated with [[Mayer waves]] of blood pressure), but this remains controversial.\n\nFactors that affect the input are the [[baroreflex]], [[thermoregulation]], [[hormones]], [[sleep-wake cycle]], meals, physical activity, and [[stress (biology)|stress]].\n\nDecreased PSNS activity or increased SNS activity will result in reduced HRV. High frequency (HF) activity (0.15 to 0.40&nbsp;Hz), especially, has been linked to PSNS activity. Activity in this range is associated with the respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), a vagally mediated modulation of heart rate such that it increases during inspiration and decreases during expiration. Less is known about the physiological inputs of the low frequency (LF) activity (0.04 to 0.15&nbsp;Hz). Though previously thought to reflect SNS activity, it is now widely accepted that it reflects a mixture of both the SNS and PSNS.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Billman GE | title = The LF/HF ratio does not accurately measure cardiac sympatho-vagal balance | journal = Frontiers in Physiology | volume = 4 | pages = 26 | date = 2013 | pmid = 23431279 | pmc = 3576706 | doi = 10.3389/fphys.2013.00026 }}</ref>\n\n==Phenomena==\n\nThere are two primary fluctuations:\n* Respiratory arrhythmia (or [[respiratory sinus arrhythmia]]).<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Hales S | title = Statistical Essays: Containing Haemastaticks. | location = London, UK | publisher = Innys, Manby and Woodward | year = 1733 }}\n</ref><ref>von Haller A.

The bands are typically high frequency (HF) from 0.15 to 0.4&nbsp;Hz, low frequency (LF) from 0.04 to 0.15&nbsp;Hz, and the very low frequency (VLF) from 0.0033 to 0.04&nbsp;Hz.\n\nSeveral methods of analysis are available. [[Power spectral density]] (PSD), using parametric or nonparametric methods, provides basic information on the power distribution across frequencies. One of the most commonly used PSD methods is the [[discrete Fourier transform]].\nMethods for the calculation of PSD may be generally classified as nonparametric and parametric. In most instances, both methods provide comparable results. The advantages of the ''nonparametric'' methods are (1) the simplicity of the algorithm used (fast Fourier transform [FFT] in most of the cases) and (2) the high processing speed.  The advantages of ''parametric'' methods are (1) smoother spectral components that can be distinguished independent of preselected frequency bands, (2) easy postprocessing of the spectrum with an automatic calculation of low- and high-frequency power components with an easy identification of the central frequency of each component, and (3) an accurate estimation of PSD even on a small number of samples on which the signal is supposed to maintain stationarity. The basic disadvantage of parametric methods is the need of verification of the suitability of the chosen model and of its complexity (that is, the order of the model).\n\nIn addition to classical FFT-based methods used for the calculation of frequency parameters, a more appropriate PSD estimation method is the Lomb\u2013Scargle (LS) periodogram.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = I\u015fler Y, Kuntalp M | title = Combining classical HRV indices with wavelet entropy measures improves to performance in diagnosing congestive heart failure | journal = Computers in Biology and Medicine | volume = 37 | issue = 10 | pages = 1502\u201310 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17359959 | doi = 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2007.01.012 }}</ref> Analysis has shown that the LS periodogram can produce a more accurate estimate of the PSD than FFT methods for typical RR data. Since the RR data is an unevenly sampled data, another advantage of the LS method is that in contrast to FFT-based methods it is able to be used without the need to resample and detrend the RR data.\n\nAlternatively, to avoid artefacts that are created when calculating the power of a signal that includes a single high-intensity peak (for example caused by an arrhythmic heart beat), the concept of the 'instantaneous Amplitude' has been introduced, which is based on the Hilbert transform of the RR data.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = von Rosenberg W, Chanwimalueang T, Adjei T, Jaffer U, Goverdovsky V, Mandic DP | title = Resolving Ambiguities in the LF/HF Ratio: LF-HF Scatter Plots for the Categorization of Mental and Physical Stress from HRV | language = English | journal = Frontiers in Physiology | volume = 8 | pages = 360 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28659811 | pmc = 5469891 | doi = 10.3389/fphys.2017.00360 }}</ref>\n\nA newly used HRV index{{citation needed|reason=used by whom?|date=August 2015}}, which depends on the wavelet entropy measures, is an alternative choice. The wavelet entropy measures are calculated using a three-step procedure defined in the literature. First, the wavelet packet algorithm is implemented using the Daubechies 4 (DB4) function as the mother wavelet with a scale of 7. Once the wavelet coefficients are obtained, the energy for each coefficient are calculated as described in the literature. After calculating the normalized values of wavelet energies, which represent the relative wavelet energy (or the probability distribution), the wavelet entropies are obtained using the definition of entropy given by Shannon.\n\n===Non-linear methods===\n\nGiven the complexity of the mechanisms regulating heart rate, it is reasonable to assume that applying HRV analysis based on methods of non-linear dynamics will yield valuable information.

It is found that while during wake, light and REM sleep the correlation between heartbeat with other physiological systems are high, they almost vanish during deep sleep.\n\n==Duration and circumstances of ECG recording==\n\nTime domain methods are preferred to frequency domain methods when short-term recordings are investigated. This is due to the fact that the recording should be at least 10 times the wavelength of the lowest frequency bound of interest. Thus, recording of approximately 1 minute is needed to assess the HF components of HRV (i.e., a lowest bound of 0.15&nbsp;Hz is a cycle of 6.6 seconds and so 10 cycles require ~60 seconds), while more than 4 minutes are needed to address the LF component (with a lower bound of 0.04&nbsp;Hz).\n\nAlthough time domain methods, especially the SDNN and RMSSD methods, can be used to investigate recordings of long durations, a substantial part of the long-term variability is day\u2013night differences. Thus, long-term recordings analyzed by time domain methods should contain at least 18 hours of analyzable ECG data that include the whole night.\n\n==Physiological correlates of HRV components==\n\n===Autonomic influences of heart rate===\nAlthough cardiac automaticity is intrinsic to various pacemaker tissues, heart rate and rhythm are largely under the control of the autonomic nervous system. The parasympathetic influence on heart rate is mediated via release of acetylcholine by the vagus nerve. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors respond to this release mostly by an increase in cell membrane K+ conductance. Acetylcholine also inhibits the hyperpolarization-activated \"pacemaker\" current. The \"Ik decay\" hypothesis proposes that pacemaker depolarization results from slow deactivation of the delayed rectifier current, Ik, which, due to a time-independent background inward current, causes diastolic depolarization. Conversely, the \"If activation\" hypothesis suggests that after action potential termination, If provides a slowly activating inward current predominating over decaying Ik, thus initiating slow diastolic depolarization.\n\nThe sympathetic influence on heart rate is mediated by release of epinephrine and norepinephrine. Activation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors results in cAMP-mediated phosphorylation of membrane proteins and increases in ICaL and in If the end result is an acceleration of the slow diastolic depolarization.\n\nUnder resting conditions, vagal tone prevails and variations in heart period are largely dependent on vagal modulation. The vagal and sympathetic activity constantly interact. Because the sinus node is rich in acetylcholinesterase, the effect of any vagal impulse is brief because the acetylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed. Parasympathetic influences exceed sympathetic effects probably through two independent mechanisms: a cholinergically induced reduction of norepinephrine released in response to sympathetic activity, and a cholinergic attenuation of the response to an adrenergic stimulus.\n\n===Components===\nThe RR interval variations present during resting conditions represent beat-by-beat variations in cardiac autonomic inputs. However, efferent vagal (parasympathetic) activity is a major contributor to the HF component, as seen in clinical and experimental observations of autonomic maneuvers such as electrical vagal stimulation, muscarinic receptor blockade, and vagotomy. More problematic is the interpretation of the LF component, which was considered by some as a marker of sympathetic modulation (especially when expressed in normalized units) but is now known to include both sympathetic and vagal influences. For example, during sympathetic activation the resulting tachycardia is usually accompanied by a marked reduction in total power, whereas the reverse occurs during vagal activation. Thus the spectral components change in the same direction and do not indicate that LF faithfully reflects sympathetic effects.\n\nHRV measures fluctuations in autonomic inputs to the heart rather than the mean level of autonomic inputs. Thus, both withdrawal and saturatingly high levels of autonomic input to the heart can lead to diminished HRV.\n\n==Changes related to specific pathologies==\nA reduction of HRV has been reported in several cardiovascular and noncardiovascular diseases.\n\n===Myocardial infarction===\nDepressed HRV after MI may reflect a decrease in vagal activity directed to the heart. HRV in patients surviving an acute MI reveal a reduction in total and in the individual power of spectral components. The presence of an alteration in neural control is also reflected in a blunting of day-night variations of RR interval. In post-MI patients with a very depressed HRV, most of the residual energy is distributed in the VLF frequency range below 0.03&nbsp;Hz, with only a small respiration-related variations.\n\n===Diabetic neuropathy===\nIn neuropathy associated with diabetes mellitus characterized by alteration in small nerve fibers, a reduction in time domain parameters of HRV seems not only to carry negative prognostic value but also to precede the clinical expression of autonomic neuropathy. In diabetic patients without evidence of autonomic neuropathy, reduction of the absolute power of LF and HF during controlled conditions was also reported. Similarly, diabetic patients can be differentiated from normal controls on the basis of reduction in HRV.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Cardiac transplantation===\nA very reduced HRV with no definite spectral components has been reported in patients with a recent heart transplant. The appearance of discrete spectral components in a few patients is considered to reflect cardiac reinnervation. This reinnervation may occur as early as 1 to 2 years after transplantation and is assumed to be of sympathetic origin. In addition, a correlation between respiratory rate and the HF component of HRV observed in some transplanted patients also indicates that a nonneural mechanism may generate a respiration-related rhythmic oscillation.\n\n===Myocardial dysfunction===\nA reduced HRV has been observed consistently in patients with cardiac failure. In this condition characterized by signs of sympathetic activation such as faster heart rates and high levels of circulating catecholamines, a relation between changes in HRV and the extent of left ventricular dysfunction was reported. In fact, whereas the reduction in time domain measures of HRV seemed to parallel the severity of the disease, the relationship between spectral components and indices of ventricular dysfunction appears to be more complex. In particular, in most patients with a very advanced phase of the disease and with a drastic reduction in HRV, an LF component could not be detected despite the clinical signs of sympathetic activation. This reflects that, as stated above, the LF may not accurately reflect cardiac sympathetic tone.\n\n===Liver cirrhosis===\nLiver [[cirrhosis]] is associated with decreased HRV. Decreased HRV in patients with cirrhosis has a prognostic value and predicts mortality. Loss of HRV is also associated with higher plasma pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and impaired neurocognitive function in this patient population.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mani AR, Montagnese S, Jackson CD, Jenkins CW, Head IM, Stephens RC, Moore KP, Morgan MY | title = Decreased heart rate variability in patients with cirrhosis relates to the presence and degree of hepatic encephalopathy | journal = American Journal of Physiology.

However, an LF component can be detected in HRV and arterial pressure variabilities of some tetraplegic patients. Thus, the LF component of HRV in those without intact sympathetic inputs to the heart represent vagal modulation.\n\n===Sudden cardiac death===\nVictims of [[sudden cardiac death]] have been found to have had lower HRV than healthy individuals.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = M\u00f8lgaard H, S\u00f8rensen KE, Bjerregaard P | title = Attenuated 24-h heart rate variability in apparently healthy subjects, subsequently suffering sudden cardiac death | journal = Clinical Autonomic Research | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 233\u20137 | date = September 1991 | pmid = 1822256 | doi = 10.1007/BF01824992 }}</ref><ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n===Cancer===\nHRV correlates with the progression of disease and outcome of cancer patients, according to a systematic review of published studies.<ref name=Kloter2018>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kloter E, Barrueto K, Klein SD, Scholkmann F, Wolf U | title = Heart Rate Variability as a Prognostic Factor for Cancer Survival - A Systematic Review | journal = Frontiers in Physiology | volume = 9 | pages = 623 | year = 2018 | pmid = 29896113 | pmc = 5986915 | doi = 10.3389/fphys.2018.00623 }}</ref>\n\n==Modifications by specific interventions==\n\nInterventions that augment HRV may be protective against cardiac mortality and sudden cardiac death. Although the rationale for changing HRV is sound, it also contains the inherent danger of leading to the unwarranted assumption that modification of HRV translates directly into cardiac protection, which may not be the case. Despite the growing consensus that increases in vagal activity can be beneficial, it is not as yet known how much vagal activity (or HRV as a marker) has to increase in order to provide adequate protection.\n\n===\u03b2-Adrenergic blockade===\nThe data on the effect of \u03b2-blockers on HRV in post-MI patients are surprisingly scant. Despite the observation of statistically significant increases, the actual changes are very modest. In conscious post-MI dogs, \u03b2-blockers do not modify HRV. The unexpected observation that before MI, \u03b2-blockade increases HRV only in the animals destined to be at low risk for lethal arrhythmias after MI may suggest novel approaches to post-MI risk stratification.\n\n===Antiarrhythmic drugs===\nData exist for several antiarrhythmic drugs. Flecainide and propafenone but not amiodarone were reported to decrease time domain measures of HRV in patients with chronic ventricular arrhythmia. In another study, propafenone reduced HRV and decreased LF much more than HF. A larger study confirmed that flecainide, also encainide and moricizine, decreased HRV in post-MI patients but found no correlation between the change in HRV and mortality during follow-up. Thus, some antiarrhythmic drugs associated with increased mortality can reduce HRV. However, it is not known whether these changes in HRV have any direct prognostic significance.\n\n===Scopolamine===\nLow-dose muscarinic receptor blockers, such as atropine and [[scopolamine]], may produce a paradoxical increase in vagal effects on the heart, as suggested by a decrease in heart rate. In addition, scopolamine and low dose atropine can markedly increase HRV. However, though the heart rate slowing in proportional to the (low) dose of atropine, the increase in HRV varies widely across and within individuals. This suggests that even for vagal activity to the heart, HRV may be a limited marker.\n\n===Thrombolysis===\nThe effect of [[thrombolysis]] on HRV (assessed by pNN50) was reported in 95 patients with acute MI. HRV was higher 90 minutes after thrombolysis in the patients with patency of the infarct-related artery. However, this difference was no longer evident when the entire 24 hours were analyzed.\n\n===Exercise training===\nExercise training may decrease cardiovascular mortality and sudden cardiac death. Regular exercise training is also thought to modify cardiac autonomic control. Individuals who exercise regularly have a 'training bradycardia' (i.e., low resting heart rate) and generally have higher HRV than sedentary individuals.\n\n===Biofeedback===\nThe technique called ''resonant breathing [[biofeedback]]'' teaches how to recognize and control involuntary heart rate variability. A randomized study by Sutarto et al. assessed the effect of resonant breathing biofeedback among manufacturing operators; depression, anxiety and stress significantly decreased.<ref name=\"Sutarto2012\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sutarto AP, Wahab MN, Zin NM | title = Resonant breathing biofeedback training for stress reduction among manufacturing operators | journal = International Journal of Occupational Safety and Ergonomics | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 549\u201361 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23294659 | doi = 10.1080/10803548.2012.11076959 | doi-access = free }}</ref> A first overall meta-analysis by Goessl VC et al.

The [[Sinoatrial node|SA node]] receives several different inputs and the  instantaneous heart rate or RR interval and its variation are the results of these inputs.\n\nThe main inputs are the [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] and the [[parasympathetic nervous system]] (PSNS) and [[humoral factor]]s. Respiration gives rise to waves in heart rate mediated primarily via the PSNS, and it is thought that the lag in the [[baroreceptor]] feedback loop may give rise to 10 second waves in heart rate (associated with [[Mayer waves]] of blood pressure), but this remains controversial.\n\nFactors that affect the input are the [[baroreflex]], [[thermoregulation]], [[hormones]], [[sleep-wake cycle]], meals, physical activity, and [[stress (biology)|stress]].\n\nDecreased PSNS activity or increased SNS activity will result in reduced HRV. High frequency (HF) activity (0.15 to 0.40&nbsp;Hz), especially, has been linked to PSNS activity. Activity in this range is associated with the respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), a vagally mediated modulation of heart rate such that it increases during inspiration and decreases during expiration. Less is known about the physiological inputs of the low frequency (LF) activity (0.04 to 0.15&nbsp;Hz). Though previously thought to reflect SNS activity, it is now widely accepted that it reflects a mixture of both the SNS and PSNS.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Billman GE | title = The LF/HF ratio does not accurately measure cardiac sympatho-vagal balance | journal = Frontiers in Physiology | volume = 4 | pages = 26 | date = 2013 | pmid = 23431279 | pmc = 3576706 | doi = 10.3389/fphys.2013.00026 }}</ref>\n\n==Phenomena==\n\nThere are two primary fluctuations:\n* Respiratory arrhythmia (or [[respiratory sinus arrhythmia]]).<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Hales S | title = Statistical Essays: Containing Haemastaticks. | location = London, UK | publisher = Innys, Manby and Woodward | year = 1733 }}\n</ref><ref>von Haller A.

HRV is highly sensitive to artifact and errors in as low as even 2% of the data will result in unwanted biases in HRV calculations.

The bands are typically high frequency (HF) from 0.15 to 0.4&nbsp;Hz, low frequency (LF) from 0.04 to 0.15&nbsp;Hz, and the very low frequency (VLF) from 0.0033 to 0.04&nbsp;Hz.\n\nSeveral methods of analysis are available. [[Power spectral density]] (PSD), using parametric or nonparametric methods, provides basic information on the power distribution across frequencies. One of the most commonly used PSD methods is the [[discrete Fourier transform]].\nMethods for the calculation of PSD may be generally classified as nonparametric and parametric. In most instances, both methods provide comparable results. The advantages of the ''nonparametric'' methods are (1) the simplicity of the algorithm used (fast Fourier transform [FFT] in most of the cases) and (2) the high processing speed.  The advantages of ''parametric'' methods are (1) smoother spectral components that can be distinguished independent of preselected frequency bands, (2) easy postprocessing of the spectrum with an automatic calculation of low- and high-frequency power components with an easy identification of the central frequency of each component, and (3) an accurate estimation of PSD even on a small number of samples on which the signal is supposed to maintain stationarity. The basic disadvantage of parametric methods is the need of verification of the suitability of the chosen model and of its complexity (that is, the order of the model).\n\nIn addition to classical FFT-based methods used for the calculation of frequency parameters, a more appropriate PSD estimation method is the Lomb\u2013Scargle (LS) periodogram.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = I\u015fler Y, Kuntalp M | title = Combining classical HRV indices with wavelet entropy measures improves to performance in diagnosing congestive heart failure | journal = Computers in Biology and Medicine | volume = 37 | issue = 10 | pages = 1502\u201310 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17359959 | doi = 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2007.01.012 }}</ref> Analysis has shown that the LS periodogram can produce a more accurate estimate of the PSD than FFT methods for typical RR data. Since the RR data is an unevenly sampled data, another advantage of the LS method is that in contrast to FFT-based methods it is able to be used without the need to resample and detrend the RR data.\n\nAlternatively, to avoid artefacts that are created when calculating the power of a signal that includes a single high-intensity peak (for example caused by an arrhythmic heart beat), the concept of the 'instantaneous Amplitude' has been introduced, which is based on the Hilbert transform of the RR data.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = von Rosenberg W, Chanwimalueang T, Adjei T, Jaffer U, Goverdovsky V, Mandic DP | title = Resolving Ambiguities in the LF/HF Ratio: LF-HF Scatter Plots for the Categorization of Mental and Physical Stress from HRV | language = English | journal = Frontiers in Physiology | volume = 8 | pages = 360 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28659811 | pmc = 5469891 | doi = 10.3389/fphys.2017.00360 }}</ref>\n\nA newly used HRV index{{citation needed|reason=used by whom?|date=August 2015}}, which depends on the wavelet entropy measures, is an alternative choice. The wavelet entropy measures are calculated using a three-step procedure defined in the literature. First, the wavelet packet algorithm is implemented using the Daubechies 4 (DB4) function as the mother wavelet with a scale of 7. Once the wavelet coefficients are obtained, the energy for each coefficient are calculated as described in the literature. After calculating the normalized values of wavelet energies, which represent the relative wavelet energy (or the probability distribution), the wavelet entropies are obtained using the definition of entropy given by Shannon.\n\n===Non-linear methods===\n\nGiven the complexity of the mechanisms regulating heart rate, it is reasonable to assume that applying HRV analysis based on methods of non-linear dynamics will yield valuable information.

Bashan, R.P. Bartsch, J.W. Kantelhardt, S. Havlin, P.C. Ivanov |year=2012 |title= Network physiology reveals relations between network topology and physiological function |journal= Nature Communications |volume=3\u00a0 |pages=702|doi=10.1038/ncomms1705\u00a0|doi-access=free }}</ref>\u00a0. It is found that while during wake, light and REM sleep the correlation between heartbeat with other physiological systems are high, they almost vanish during deep sleep.\n\n==Duration and circumstances of ECG recording==\n\nTime domain methods are preferred to frequency domain methods when short-term recordings are investigated. This is due to the fact that the recording should be at least 10 times the wavelength of the lowest frequency bound of interest. Thus, recording of approximately 1 minute is needed to assess the HF components of HRV (i.e., a lowest bound of 0.15&nbsp;Hz is a cycle of 6.6 seconds and so 10 cycles require ~60 seconds), while more than 4 minutes are needed to address the LF component (with a lower bound of 0.04&nbsp;Hz).\n\nAlthough time domain methods, especially the SDNN and RMSSD methods, can be used to investigate recordings of long durations, a substantial part of the long-term variability is day\u2013night differences. Thus, long-term recordings analyzed by time domain methods should contain at least 18 hours of analyzable ECG data that include the whole night.\n\n==Physiological correlates of HRV components==\n\n===Autonomic influences of heart rate===\nAlthough cardiac automaticity is intrinsic to various pacemaker tissues, heart rate and rhythm are largely under the control of the autonomic nervous system. The parasympathetic influence on heart rate is mediated via release of acetylcholine by the vagus nerve. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors respond to this release mostly by an increase in cell membrane K+ conductance. Acetylcholine also inhibits the hyperpolarization-activated \"pacemaker\" current. The \"Ik decay\" hypothesis proposes that pacemaker depolarization results from slow deactivation of the delayed rectifier current, Ik, which, due to a time-independent background inward current, causes diastolic depolarization. Conversely, the \"If activation\" hypothesis suggests that after action potential termination, If provides a slowly activating inward current predominating over decaying Ik, thus initiating slow diastolic depolarization.\n\nThe sympathetic influence on heart rate is mediated by release of epinephrine and norepinephrine. Activation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors results in cAMP-mediated phosphorylation of membrane proteins and increases in ICaL and in If the end result is an acceleration of the slow diastolic depolarization.\n\nUnder resting conditions, vagal tone prevails and variations in heart period are largely dependent on vagal modulation. The vagal and sympathetic activity constantly interact. Because the sinus node is rich in acetylcholinesterase, the effect of any vagal impulse is brief because the acetylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed. Parasympathetic influences exceed sympathetic effects probably through two independent mechanisms: a cholinergically induced reduction of norepinephrine released in response to sympathetic activity, and a cholinergic attenuation of the response to an adrenergic stimulus.\n\n===Components===\nThe RR interval variations present during resting conditions represent beat-by-beat variations in cardiac autonomic inputs. However, efferent vagal (parasympathetic) activity is a major contributor to the HF component, as seen in clinical and experimental observations of autonomic maneuvers such as electrical vagal stimulation, muscarinic receptor blockade, and vagotomy. More problematic is the interpretation of the LF component, which was considered by some as a marker of sympathetic modulation (especially when expressed in normalized units) but is now known to include both sympathetic and vagal influences. For example, during sympathetic activation the resulting tachycardia is usually accompanied by a marked reduction in total power, whereas the reverse occurs during vagal activation. Thus the spectral components change in the same direction and do not indicate that LF faithfully reflects sympathetic effects.\n\nHRV measures fluctuations in autonomic inputs to the heart rather than the mean level of autonomic inputs. Thus, both withdrawal and saturatingly high levels of autonomic input to the heart can lead to diminished HRV.\n\n==Changes related to specific pathologies==\nA reduction of HRV has been reported in several cardiovascular and noncardiovascular diseases.\n\n===Myocardial infarction===\nDepressed HRV after MI may reflect a decrease in vagal activity directed to the heart. HRV in patients surviving an acute MI reveal a reduction in total and in the individual power of spectral components. The presence of an alteration in neural control is also reflected in a blunting of day-night variations of RR interval. In post-MI patients with a very depressed HRV, most of the residual energy is distributed in the VLF frequency range below 0.03&nbsp;Hz, with only a small respiration-related variations.\n\n===Diabetic neuropathy===\nIn neuropathy associated with diabetes mellitus characterized by alteration in small nerve fibers, a reduction in time domain parameters of HRV seems not only to carry negative prognostic value but also to precede the clinical expression of autonomic neuropathy. In diabetic patients without evidence of autonomic neuropathy, reduction of the absolute power of LF and HF during controlled conditions was also reported. Similarly, diabetic patients can be differentiated from normal controls on the basis of reduction in HRV.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Cardiac transplantation===\nA very reduced HRV with no definite spectral components has been reported in patients with a recent heart transplant. The appearance of discrete spectral components in a few patients is considered to reflect cardiac reinnervation. This reinnervation may occur as early as 1 to 2 years after transplantation and is assumed to be of sympathetic origin. In addition, a correlation between respiratory rate and the HF component of HRV observed in some transplanted patients also indicates that a nonneural mechanism may generate a respiration-related rhythmic oscillation.\n\n===Myocardial dysfunction===\nA reduced HRV has been observed consistently in patients with cardiac failure. In this condition characterized by signs of sympathetic activation such as faster heart rates and high levels of circulating catecholamines, a relation between changes in HRV and the extent of left ventricular dysfunction was reported. In fact, whereas the reduction in time domain measures of HRV seemed to parallel the severity of the disease, the relationship between spectral components and indices of ventricular dysfunction appears to be more complex. In particular, in most patients with a very advanced phase of the disease and with a drastic reduction in HRV, an LF component could not be detected despite the clinical signs of sympathetic activation. This reflects that, as stated above, the LF may not accurately reflect cardiac sympathetic tone.\n\n===Liver cirrhosis===\nLiver [[cirrhosis]] is associated with decreased HRV. Decreased HRV in patients with cirrhosis has a prognostic value and predicts mortality. Loss of HRV is also associated with higher plasma pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and impaired neurocognitive function in this patient population.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mani AR, Montagnese S, Jackson CD, Jenkins CW, Head IM, Stephens RC, Moore KP, Morgan MY | title = Decreased heart rate variability in patients with cirrhosis relates to the presence and degree of hepatic encephalopathy | journal = American Journal of Physiology.

However, an LF component can be detected in HRV and arterial pressure variabilities of some tetraplegic patients.

Although the rationale for changing HRV is sound, it also contains the inherent danger of leading to the unwarranted assumption that modification of HRV translates directly into cardiac protection, which may not be the case. Despite the growing consensus that increases in vagal activity can be beneficial, it is not as yet known how much vagal activity (or HRV as a marker) has to increase in order to provide adequate protection.\n\n===\u03b2-Adrenergic blockade===\nThe data on the effect of \u03b2-blockers on HRV in post-MI patients are surprisingly scant. Despite the observation of statistically significant increases, the actual changes are very modest. In conscious post-MI dogs, \u03b2-blockers do not modify HRV. The unexpected observation that before MI, \u03b2-blockade increases HRV only in the animals destined to be at low risk for lethal arrhythmias after MI may suggest novel approaches to post-MI risk stratification.\n\n===Antiarrhythmic drugs===\nData exist for several antiarrhythmic drugs. Flecainide and propafenone but not amiodarone were reported to decrease time domain measures of HRV in patients with chronic ventricular arrhythmia. In another study, propafenone reduced HRV and decreased LF much more than HF. A larger study confirmed that flecainide, also encainide and moricizine, decreased HRV in post-MI patients but found no correlation between the change in HRV and mortality during follow-up. Thus, some antiarrhythmic drugs associated with increased mortality can reduce HRV. However, it is not known whether these changes in HRV have any direct prognostic significance.\n\n===Scopolamine===\nLow-dose muscarinic receptor blockers, such as atropine and [[scopolamine]], may produce a paradoxical increase in vagal effects on the heart, as suggested by a decrease in heart rate. In addition, scopolamine and low dose atropine can markedly increase HRV. However, though the heart rate slowing in proportional to the (low) dose of atropine, the increase in HRV varies widely across and within individuals. This suggests that even for vagal activity to the heart, HRV may be a limited marker.\n\n===Thrombolysis===\nThe effect of [[thrombolysis]] on HRV (assessed by pNN50) was reported in 95 patients with acute MI. HRV was higher 90 minutes after thrombolysis in the patients with patency of the infarct-related artery. However, this difference was no longer evident when the entire 24 hours were analyzed.\n\n===Exercise training===\nExercise training may decrease cardiovascular mortality and sudden cardiac death. Regular exercise training is also thought to modify cardiac autonomic control. Individuals who exercise regularly have a 'training bradycardia' (i.e., low resting heart rate) and generally have higher HRV than sedentary individuals.\n\n===Biofeedback===\nThe technique called ''resonant breathing [[biofeedback]]'' teaches how to recognize and control involuntary heart rate variability. A randomized study by Sutarto et al. assessed the effect of resonant breathing biofeedback among manufacturing operators; depression, anxiety and stress significantly decreased.<ref name=\"Sutarto2012\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sutarto AP, Wahab MN, Zin NM | title = Resonant breathing biofeedback training for stress reduction among manufacturing operators | journal = International Journal of Occupational Safety and Ergonomics | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 549\u201361 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23294659 | doi = 10.1080/10803548.2012.11076959 | doi-access = free }}</ref> A first overall meta-analysis by Goessl VC et al.

The [[Chickahominy (tribe)|Chickahominy]] Indians frequented this area as well as nearby [[Charles City County, Virginia|Charles City County]], and two tribes are still well-established in this area.\n\nAmong the earliest settlers of New Kent County was Nicholas Gentry, who settled in New Kent in 1684. The parish register books of St. Peter's Parish show that Nicholas Gentry's daughter was baptized in the church in 1687. The records also reflect other Gentrys, probably Nicholas Gentry's relations, Peter and Samuel Gentry.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TbhYAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA227&dq=%22gentry+family%22+virginia#PPA15,M1|title=The Gentry family in America: 1676 to 1909, including notes on the following families related to the Gentrys: Claiborne, Harris, Hawkins, Robinson, Smith, Wyatt, Sharp, Fulkerson, Butler, Bush, Blythe, Pabody, Noble, Haggard, and Tindall|first=Richard|last=Gentry|date=April 5, 2018|publisher=Printed for the author by the Grafton press|accessdate=April 5, 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref> As the result of arson confessed to by John Price Posey and Tho Green, and, allegedly, involving \"a negro boy belonging to W.

Scaffolding is also used in adapted forms for formwork and shoring, grandstand seating, concert stages, access/viewing towers, exhibition stands, ski ramps, half pipes and art projects.\n\nThere are five main types of scaffolding used worldwide today.  These are [[Tube and clamp scaffold|Tube and Coupler]] (fitting) components, prefabricated modular system scaffold components, H-frame / facade modular system scaffolds, timber scaffolds and bamboo scaffolds (particularly in China). Each type is made from several components which often include:\n* A base jack or plate which is a load-bearing base for the scaffold. \n* The standard, the upright component with connector joins. \n* The ledger, a horizontal brace. \n* The transom, a horizontal cross-section load-bearing component which holds the batten, board, or decking unit. \n* Brace diagonal and/or cross section bracing component. \n* Batten or board decking component used to make the working platform. \n* Coupler, a fitting used to join components together. \n* Scaffold tie, used to tie in the scaffold to structures. \n* Brackets, used to extend the width of working platforms. \nSpecialized components used to aid in their use as a temporary structure often include heavy duty load bearing transoms, ladders or stairway units for the ingress and egress of the scaffold, beams ladder/unit types used to span obstacles and rubbish chutes used to remove unwanted materials from the scaffold or construction project.\n\n==History==\n\n===Antiquity===\nSockets in the walls around the [[paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s at [[Lascaux]], suggest that a scaffold system was used for painting the ceiling, over 17,000 years ago.\n\nThe [[Berlin Foundry Cup]] depicts scaffolding in [[ancient Greece]] (early 5th century BC).  Egyptians, [[Nubia]]ns and Chinese are also recorded as having used scaffolding-like structures to build tall buildings. Early scaffolding was made of wood and secured with rope knots.\n\n===Modern era===\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2019}}\n[[File:Buckingham palace1913.jpg|thumb|Repairwork on [[Buckingham Palace]] in 1913, under the scaffolding of Patent Rapid.]]\n\nScaffolding was erected by individual firms with wildly varying standards and sizes. The process was revolutionized by Daniel Palmer Jones and David Henry Jones. Modern day scaffolding standards, practices and processes can be attributed to these men and their companies: Rapid Scaffold Tie Company Ltd, Tubular Scaffolding Company and Scaffolding Great Britain Ltd (SGB).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.ie/search?tbo=p&tbm=pts&hl=en&q=ininventor:%22Daniel+Palmer-Jones%22&gws_rd=cr&ei=hHQYVefhJ4ThapKWgdgG|title=ininventor:\"Daniel Palmer-Jones\" - Google Search|website=www.google.ie}}</ref>\n\nDavid Palmer-Jones patented the \"Scaffixer\", a coupling device far more robust than rope which revolutionized scaffolding construction. In 1913, his company was commissioned for the reconstruction of [[Buckingham Palace]], during which his Scaffixer gained much publicity. Palmer-Jones followed this up with the improved \"Universal Coupler\" in 1919 - this soon became the industry standard coupling and has remained so to this day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harsco-i.co.uk/pages/8113|title=Early developments - At the forefront of the industry}}</ref>\n\nAdvancements in metallurgy throughout the early 20th century saw the introduction of tubular steel [[water pipe]]s (instead of timber poles) with standardized dimensions, allowing for the industrial [[Interchangeable parts|interchangeability of parts]] and improving the [[structural stability]] of the scaffold. The use of diagonal bracings also helped to improve stability, especially on tall buildings. The first frame system was brought to market by SGB in 1944 and was used extensively for the [[Aftermath of World War II|postwar reconstruction]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kolkatascaffolding.com/YELLOW_BROCHURE.pdf|title=History of scaffolding|publisher=S.

Requirements given are for scaffold structures that rely on the adjacent structures for stability. In general these requirements also apply to other types of working scaffolds.\n\nThe purpose of a working scaffold is to provide a safe working platform and access suitable for work crews to carry out their work. The European Standard sets out performance requirements for working scaffolds. These are substantially independent of the materials of which the scaffold is made. The standard is intended to be used as the basis for enquiry and design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scaffolding-uk.co.uk/downloads/New+Scaffolding+Guidance+TG20.pdf|title=scaffolding-uk.co.uk|website=www.scaffolding-uk.co.uk|accessdate=6 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Materials===\nThe basic components of scaffolding are tubes, couplers and boards.\n[[File:Cincinnati-scaffolding.jpg|thumb|left|Extensive scaffolding on a building in downtown [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]. This type of scaffolding is called pipe staging.]]\n[[File:CantileverScaffold.jpg|thumb|left|Assembly of bamboo scaffolding cantilevered over a Hong Kong street]]\nThe basic lightweight tube scaffolding that became the standard and revolutionised scaffolding, becoming the baseline for decades, was invented and marketed in the mid-1950s.  With one basic 24 pound unit a scaffold of various sizes and heights could be assembled easily by a couple of labourers without the nuts or bolts previously needed.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nt8DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA103&dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sJAKT-nTDMqRgQenq_mzAg&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Light Weight Scaffolding Goes Together Without Nuts or Bolts.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', February 1954, p. 103.</ref>\n\nTubes are usually made either of [[steel]] or [[aluminium]]; although there is [[Composite material|composite]] scaffolding which uses filament-wound tubes of [[glass fibre]] in a [[nylon]] or [[polyester]] matrix, because of the high cost of composite tube, it is usually only used when there is a risk from overhead electric cables that cannot be isolated. If steel, they are either 'black' or galvanised. The tubes come in a variety of lengths and a standard [[diameter]] of 48.3&nbsp;mm. (1.5 [[Nominal Pipe Size|NPS]] [[Pipe (material)|pipe]]). The chief difference between the two types of metal tubes is the lower weight of aluminium tubes (1.7&nbsp;kg/m as opposed to 4.4&nbsp;kg/m). However they are more flexible and have a lower resistance to stress. Tubes are generally bought in 6.3 m lengths and can then be cut down to certain typical sizes. Most large companies will brand their tubes with their name and address in order to deter theft.\n\nBoards provide a working surface for scaffold users. They are seasoned [[wood]] and come in three thicknesses (38&nbsp;mm (usual), 50&nbsp;mm and 63&nbsp;mm) are a standard width (225&nbsp;mm) and are a maximum of 3.9 m long. The board ends are protected either by metal plates called hoop irons or sometimes nail plates, which often have the company name stamped into them. Timber scaffold boards in the UK should comply with the requirements of BS 2482. As well as timber, steel or aluminium decking is used, as well as [[laminate]] boards. In addition to the boards for the working platform, there are sole boards which are placed beneath the scaffolding if the surface is soft or otherwise suspect, although ordinary boards can also be used. Another solution, called a scaffpad, is made from a rubber base with a base plate moulded inside; these are desirable for use on uneven ground since they adapt, whereas sole boards may split and have to be replaced.\n\n[[File:Scaffold Pole Section.jpg|thumb|A short section of steel scaffold tube.]]\nCouplers are the fittings which hold the tubes together. The most common are called scaffold couplers, and there are three basic types: ''right-angle couplers'', ''putlog couplers'' and ''swivel couplers''. To join tubes end-to-end ''joint pins'' (also called spigots) or ''sleeve couplers'' are used. Only right angle couplers and swivel couplers can be used to fix tube in a 'load-bearing connection'. Single couplers are not load-bearing couplers and have no design capacity.\n\nOther common scaffolding components include base plates, [[ladder]]s, [[rope]]s, anchor ties, reveal ties, gin wheels, sheeting, etc.\nMost companies will adopt a specific colour to paint the scaffolding with, in order that quick visual identification can be made in case of theft. All components that are made from metal can be painted but items that are wooden should never be painted as this could hide defects.\nDespite the metric measurements given, many scaffolders measure tubes and boards in imperial units, with tubes from 21 feet down and boards from 13&nbsp;ft down.\n\n[[Bamboo scaffolding]] is widely used in [[Hong Kong]]<ref>{{cite news|last1=Malm|first1=Sara|title=How did that get past health and safety!

The standards, also called uprights, are the vertical tubes that transfer the entire weight of the structure to the ground where they rest on a square ''base plate'' to spread the load. The base plate has a shank in its centre to hold the tube and is sometimes pinned to a ''sole board''. Ledgers are horizontal tubes which connect between the standards. Transoms rest upon the ledgers at right angles. ''Main transoms'' are placed next to the standards, they hold the standards in place and provide support for boards; ''intermediate transoms'' are those placed between the main transoms to provide extra support for boards. In Canada this style is referred to as \"English\". \"American\" has the transoms attached to the standards and is used less but has certain advantages in some situations.\n\n[[File:Scaffolding, Tretyakovsky Proyezd, Moscow, 03 08 05.jpg|thumb|left|Scaffolding in [[Tretyakovsky Proyezd]], Moscow]]\nAs well as the tubes at right angles there are ''cross braces'' to increase rigidity, these are placed diagonally from ledger to ledger, next to the standards to which they are fitted. If the braces are fitted to the ledgers they are called ledger braces. To limit sway a ''facade brace'' is fitted to the face of the scaffold every 30 metres or so at an angle of 35\u00b0-55\u00b0 running right from the base to the top of the scaffold and fixed at every level.\n\nOf the couplers previously mentioned, right-angle couplers join ledgers or transoms to standards, putlog or single couplers join board bearing transoms to ledgers - Non-board bearing transoms should be fixed using a right-angle coupler. Swivel couplers are to connect tubes at any other angle. The actual joints are staggered to avoid occurring at the same level in neighbouring standards.\n\n[[File:scaff t 02.png|thumb|Basic scaffold dimensioning terms. No boards, bracing or couplers shown]]\nThe spacings of the basic elements in the scaffold are fairly standard. For a general purpose scaffold the maximum bay length is 2.1 m, for heavier work the bay size is reduced to 2 or even 1.8 m while for inspection a bay width of up to 2.7 m is allowed.\n\nThe scaffolding width is determined by the width of the boards, the minimum width allowed{{Where|date=July 2011}} is 600&nbsp;mm but a more typical four-board scaffold would be 870&nbsp;mm wide from standard to standard. More heavy-duty scaffolding can require 5, 6 or even up to 8 boards width. Often an ''inside board'' is added to reduce the gap between the inner standard and the structure.\n\nThe lift height, the spacing between ledgers, is 2 m, although the base lift can be up to 2.7 m. The diagram above also shows a kicker lift, which is just 150&nbsp;mm or so above the ground.\n\nTransom spacing is determined by the thickness of the boards supported, 38&nbsp;mm boards require a transom spacing of no more than 1.2 m while a 50&nbsp;mm board can stand a transom spacing of 2.6 m and 63&nbsp;mm boards can have a maximum span of 3.25 m. The minimum overhang for all boards is 50&nbsp;mm and the maximum overhang is no more than 4x the thickness of the board.\n\n===Foundations===\nGood foundations are essential. Often scaffold frameworks will require more than simple base plates to safely carry and spread the load. Scaffolding can be used without base plates on concrete or similar hard surfaces, although base plates are always recommended. For surfaces like pavements or tarmac base plates are necessary. For softer or more doubtful surfaces sole boards must be used, beneath a single standard a sole board should be at least {{convert|1000|cm2|in2}} with no dimension less than {{convert|220|mm|in}}, the thickness must be at least {{convert|35|mm|in}}. For heavier duty scaffold much more substantial baulks set in concrete can be required. On uneven ground steps must be cut for the base plates, a minimum step size of around {{convert|450|mm|in}} is recommended. A working platform requires certain other elements to be safe. They must be close-boarded, have double guard rails and toe and stop boards. Safe and secure access must also be provided.\n\n[[File:scaff wp 01.png|frame|center|Scaffolding showing required protection of a working platform with maximum dimensions. Butt-board not visible. No couplers shown]]\n----\n\n===Ties===\n[[File:Holy Trinity Vladimir.jpg|left|thumb|The Holy Trinity Church in [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], with scaffolding wrapped in safety mesh.]]\n\nScaffolds are only rarely independent structures. To provide stability for a scaffolding (at left) framework ties are generally fixed to the adjacent building/fabric/steelwork.\n\nGeneral practice is to attach a tie every 4 m on alternate lifts (traditional scaffolding). Prefabricated System scaffolds require structural connections at all frames - i.e. 2\u20133 m centres (tie patterns must be provided by the System manufacturer/supplier). The ties are coupled to the scaffold as close to the junction of standard and ledger (node point) as possible. Due to recent regulation changes, scaffolding ties must support +/- loads (tie/butt loads) and lateral (shear) loads.\n\nDue to the different nature of structures there is a variety of different ties to take advantage of the opportunities.\n\n''Through ties'' are put through structure openings such as windows. A vertical inside tube crossing the opening is attached to the scaffold by a transom and a crossing horizontal tube on the outside called a bridle tube. The gaps between the tubes and the structure surfaces are packed or wedged with timber sections to ensure a solid fit.\n\n''Box ties'' are used to attach the scaffold to suitable pillars or comparable features. Two additional transoms are put across from the lift on each side of the feature and are joined on both sides with shorter tubes called tie tubes. When a complete box tie is impossible a l-shaped ''lip tie'' can be used to hook the scaffold to the structure, to limit inward movement an additional transom, a ''butt transom'', is placed hard against the outside face of the structure.\n\nSometimes it is possible to use ''anchor ties'' (also called ''bolt ties''), these are ties fitted into holes drilled in the structure. A common type is a ring bolt with an expanding wedge which is then tied to a node point.\n\n[[File:Scaffolding Waverley Station.jpg|thumb|Scaffolding by Balfour & Beatty during refurbishment of the Waverley Station roof, Edinburgh 2011]]\nThe least 'invasive' tie is a ''reveal tie''. These use an opening in the structure but use a tube wedged horizontally in the opening. The reveal tube is usually held in place by a reveal screw pin (an adjustable threaded bar) and protective packing at either end. A transom tie tube links the reveal tube to the scaffold. Reveal ties are not well regarded, they rely solely on friction and need regular checking so it is not recommended that more than half of all ties be reveal ties.\n\nIf it is not possible to use a safe number of ties ''rakers'' can be used. These are single tubes attached to a ledger extending out from the scaffold at an angle of less than 75\u00b0 and securely founded.

The bamboo scaffolding material was imported from mainland [[China]]. Bamboo\u2014which matures after three years to the wide diameter and thick skin perfect for scaffolding\u2014came from the [[Shaoxing]] area in [[Guangdong]]. Over the past two decades, firms have had to look to [[Guangxi]] instead. The industry's fear is that one day supplies will be blocked due to export embargoes and environmental concerns. Attempts to import bamboo from [[Thailand]], or switch to synthetic or plastic bamboo, have so far proved unsuccessful.\n\nIn many African countries, notably [[Nigeria]], bamboo scaffolding is still used for small scale construction in urban areas. In rural areas, the use of bamboo scaffolding for construction is common. In fact, bamboo is an essential building and construction commodity in Nigeria; the bamboo materials are transported on heavy trucks and [[Trailer (vehicle)|trailers]] from rural areas (especially the tropical rain forest) to cities and the northern part of Nigeria.\n\nSome of the structures in relaxation and recreation centres, both in urban and rural areas of Nigeria, are put in place using bamboo materials. This is not for reasons of [[poverty]] (especially in the cities) but to add more [[aesthetics]] to these centres. Bamboo materials are still used in the construction of some [[bukas]] (local restaurants) in rural areas.<ref>unpublished journals on The Use of Bamboo in Nigeria by Olaiya Festus, Adult Education Department, University of Ado Ekiti,November 2011.</ref><ref>https://ww.academia.edu/7351624/SCAFFOLDING_PRACTICES_IN_SOME_SELECTED_CITIES_OF_NIGERIA_A_SURVEY_OF_REQUIREMENTS_AND_PROSPECTS_FOR_SPECIALIZED_SUB-CONTRACTORS_BY{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Chiang-Mai Thailand Workers-on-a-bamboo-scaffolding-01.jpg|thumb|Workers on bamboo scaffolding]]\n\n===Specifications===\nForms of bamboo scaffolding include:<ref>http://www.hkicm.org.hk/pdf/HKICM-PNCM2-TW01.pdf</ref>\n* '''Double-row Scaffold'''\nOnly double-row bamboo scaffold is allowed to be used for [[working at height]].\n* '''Nylon Mesh'''\nThe perimeter of bamboo scaffold should be covered by nylon mesh against falling objects.

These have a flattened end or have been fitted with a blade. This feature allows the end of the tube to be inserted into or rest upon the brickwork of the structure.\n\nA putlog scaffold may also be called a bricklayer's scaffold. As such, the scaffold consists only of a single row of standards with a single ledger. The putlogs are transoms - attached to the ledger at one end but integrated into the bricks at the other.\n\nSpacing is the same on a putlog scaffold as on a general purpose scaffold, and ties are still required.\nIn recent years a number of new innovations have meant an increased scope of use for scaffolding, such as ladderbeams for spanning spaces that cannot accommodate standards and the increased use of sheeting and structure to create temporary roofs.\n\n===Pump-jack===\nA pump-jack is a type of portable scaffolding system.

Scaffolding is also used in adapted forms for formwork and shoring, grandstand seating, concert stages, access/viewing towers, exhibition stands, ski ramps, half pipes and art projects.\n\nThere are five main types of scaffolding used worldwide today.  These are [[Tube and clamp scaffold|Tube and Coupler]] (fitting) components, prefabricated modular system scaffold components, H-frame / facade modular system scaffolds, timber scaffolds and bamboo scaffolds (particularly in China). Each type is made from several components which often include:\n* A base jack or plate which is a load-bearing base for the scaffold. \n* The standard, the upright component with connector joins. \n* The ledger, a horizontal brace. \n* The transom, a horizontal cross-section load-bearing component which holds the batten, board, or decking unit. \n* Brace diagonal and/or cross section bracing component. \n* Batten or board decking component used to make the working platform. \n* Coupler, a fitting used to join components together. \n* Scaffold tie, used to tie in the scaffold to structures. \n* Brackets, used to extend the width of working platforms. \nSpecialized components used to aid in their use as a temporary structure often include heavy duty load bearing transoms, ladders or stairway units for the ingress and egress of the scaffold, beams ladder/unit types used to span obstacles and rubbish chutes used to remove unwanted materials from the scaffold or construction project.\n\n==History==\n\n===Antiquity===\nSockets in the walls around the [[paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s at [[Lascaux]], suggest that a scaffold system was used for painting the ceiling, over 17,000 years ago.\n\nThe [[Berlin Foundry Cup]] depicts scaffolding in [[ancient Greece]] (early 5th century BC).  Egyptians, [[Nubia]]ns and Chinese are also recorded as having used scaffolding-like structures to build tall buildings. Early scaffolding was made of wood and secured with rope knots.\n\n===Modern era===\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2019}}\n[[File:Buckingham palace1913.jpg|thumb|Repairwork on [[Buckingham Palace]] in 1913, under the scaffolding of Patent Rapid.]]\n\nScaffolding was erected by individual firms with wildly varying standards and sizes. The process was revolutionized by Daniel Palmer Jones and David Henry Jones. Modern day scaffolding standards, practices and processes can be attributed to these men and their companies: Rapid Scaffold Tie Company Ltd, Tubular Scaffolding Company and Scaffolding Great Britain Ltd (SGB).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.ie/search?tbo=p&tbm=pts&hl=en&q=ininventor:%22Daniel+Palmer-Jones%22&gws_rd=cr&ei=hHQYVefhJ4ThapKWgdgG|title=ininventor:\"Daniel Palmer-Jones\" - Google Search|website=www.google.ie}}</ref>\n\nDavid Palmer-Jones patented the \"Scaffixer\", a coupling device far more robust than rope which revolutionized scaffolding construction. In 1913, his company was commissioned for the reconstruction of [[Buckingham Palace]], during which his Scaffixer gained much publicity. Palmer-Jones followed this up with the improved \"Universal Coupler\" in 1919 - this soon became the industry standard coupling and has remained so to this day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harsco-i.co.uk/pages/8113|title=Early developments - At the forefront of the industry}}</ref>\n\nAdvancements in metallurgy throughout the early 20th century saw the introduction of tubular steel [[water pipe]]s (instead of timber poles) with standardized dimensions, allowing for the industrial [[Interchangeable parts|interchangeability of parts]] and improving the [[structural stability]] of the scaffold. The use of diagonal bracings also helped to improve stability, especially on tall buildings.

Requirements given are for scaffold structures that rely on the adjacent structures for stability. In general these requirements also apply to other types of working scaffolds.\n\nThe purpose of a working scaffold is to provide a safe working platform and access suitable for work crews to carry out their work. The European Standard sets out performance requirements for working scaffolds. These are substantially independent of the materials of which the scaffold is made. The standard is intended to be used as the basis for enquiry and design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scaffolding-uk.co.uk/downloads/New+Scaffolding+Guidance+TG20.pdf|title=scaffolding-uk.co.uk|website=www.scaffolding-uk.co.uk|accessdate=6 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Materials===\nThe basic components of scaffolding are tubes, couplers and boards.\n[[File:Cincinnati-scaffolding.jpg|thumb|left|Extensive scaffolding on a building in downtown [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].

With one basic 24 pound unit a scaffold of various sizes and heights could be assembled easily by a couple of labourers without the nuts or bolts previously needed.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nt8DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA103&dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sJAKT-nTDMqRgQenq_mzAg&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Light Weight Scaffolding Goes Together Without Nuts or Bolts.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', February 1954, p. 103.</ref>\n\nTubes are usually made either of [[steel]] or [[aluminium]]; although there is [[Composite material|composite]] scaffolding which uses filament-wound tubes of [[glass fibre]] in a [[nylon]] or [[polyester]] matrix, because of the high cost of composite tube, it is usually only used when there is a risk from overhead electric cables that cannot be isolated. If steel, they are either 'black' or galvanised. The tubes come in a variety of lengths and a standard [[diameter]] of 48.3&nbsp;mm. (1.5 [[Nominal Pipe Size|NPS]] [[Pipe (material)|pipe]]). The chief difference between the two types of metal tubes is the lower weight of aluminium tubes (1.7&nbsp;kg/m as opposed to 4.4&nbsp;kg/m). However they are more flexible and have a lower resistance to stress. Tubes are generally bought in 6.3 m lengths and can then be cut down to certain typical sizes. Most large companies will brand their tubes with their name and address in order to deter theft.\n\nBoards provide a working surface for scaffold users. They are seasoned [[wood]] and come in three thicknesses (38&nbsp;mm (usual), 50&nbsp;mm and 63&nbsp;mm) are a standard width (225&nbsp;mm) and are a maximum of 3.9 m long. The board ends are protected either by metal plates called hoop irons or sometimes nail plates, which often have the company name stamped into them. Timber scaffold boards in the UK should comply with the requirements of BS 2482. As well as timber, steel or aluminium decking is used, as well as [[laminate]] boards. In addition to the boards for the working platform, there are sole boards which are placed beneath the scaffolding if the surface is soft or otherwise suspect, although ordinary boards can also be used. Another solution, called a scaffpad, is made from a rubber base with a base plate moulded inside; these are desirable for use on uneven ground since they adapt, whereas sole boards may split and have to be replaced.\n\n[[File:Scaffold Pole Section.jpg|thumb|A short section of steel scaffold tube.]]\nCouplers are the fittings which hold the tubes together. The most common are called scaffold couplers, and there are three basic types: ''right-angle couplers'', ''putlog couplers'' and ''swivel couplers''. To join tubes end-to-end ''joint pins'' (also called spigots) or ''sleeve couplers'' are used. Only right angle couplers and swivel couplers can be used to fix tube in a 'load-bearing connection'. Single couplers are not load-bearing couplers and have no design capacity.\n\nOther common scaffolding components include base plates, [[ladder]]s, [[rope]]s, anchor ties, reveal ties, gin wheels, sheeting, etc.\nMost companies will adopt a specific colour to paint the scaffolding with, in order that quick visual identification can be made in case of theft. All components that are made from metal can be painted but items that are wooden should never be painted as this could hide defects.\nDespite the metric measurements given, many scaffolders measure tubes and boards in imperial units, with tubes from 21 feet down and boards from 13&nbsp;ft down.\n\n[[Bamboo scaffolding]] is widely used in [[Hong Kong]]<ref>{{cite news|last1=Malm|first1=Sara|title=How did that get past health and safety!

The standards, also called uprights, are the vertical tubes that transfer the entire weight of the structure to the ground where they rest on a square ''base plate'' to spread the load. The base plate has a shank in its centre to hold the tube and is sometimes pinned to a ''sole board''. Ledgers are horizontal tubes which connect between the standards. Transoms rest upon the ledgers at right angles. ''Main transoms'' are placed next to the standards, they hold the standards in place and provide support for boards; ''intermediate transoms'' are those placed between the main transoms to provide extra support for boards. In Canada this style is referred to as \"English\". \"American\" has the transoms attached to the standards and is used less but has certain advantages in some situations.\n\n[[File:Scaffolding, Tretyakovsky Proyezd, Moscow, 03 08 05.jpg|thumb|left|Scaffolding in [[Tretyakovsky Proyezd]], Moscow]]\nAs well as the tubes at right angles there are ''cross braces'' to increase rigidity, these are placed diagonally from ledger to ledger, next to the standards to which they are fitted. If the braces are fitted to the ledgers they are called ledger braces. To limit sway a ''facade brace'' is fitted to the face of the scaffold every 30 metres or so at an angle of 35\u00b0-55\u00b0 running right from the base to the top of the scaffold and fixed at every level.\n\nOf the couplers previously mentioned, right-angle couplers join ledgers or transoms to standards, putlog or single couplers join board bearing transoms to ledgers - Non-board bearing transoms should be fixed using a right-angle coupler. Swivel couplers are to connect tubes at any other angle. The actual joints are staggered to avoid occurring at the same level in neighbouring standards.\n\n[[File:scaff t 02.png|thumb|Basic scaffold dimensioning terms. No boards, bracing or couplers shown]]\nThe spacings of the basic elements in the scaffold are fairly standard. For a general purpose scaffold the maximum bay length is 2.1 m, for heavier work the bay size is reduced to 2 or even 1.8 m while for inspection a bay width of up to 2.7 m is allowed.\n\nThe scaffolding width is determined by the width of the boards, the minimum width allowed{{Where|date=July 2011}} is 600&nbsp;mm but a more typical four-board scaffold would be 870&nbsp;mm wide from standard to standard. More heavy-duty scaffolding can require 5, 6 or even up to 8 boards width. Often an ''inside board'' is added to reduce the gap between the inner standard and the structure.\n\nThe lift height, the spacing between ledgers, is 2 m, although the base lift can be up to 2.7 m. The diagram above also shows a kicker lift, which is just 150&nbsp;mm or so above the ground.\n\nTransom spacing is determined by the thickness of the boards supported, 38&nbsp;mm boards require a transom spacing of no more than 1.2 m while a 50&nbsp;mm board can stand a transom spacing of 2.6 m and 63&nbsp;mm boards can have a maximum span of 3.25 m. The minimum overhang for all boards is 50&nbsp;mm and the maximum overhang is no more than 4x the thickness of the board.\n\n===Foundations===\nGood foundations are essential. Often scaffold frameworks will require more than simple base plates to safely carry and spread the load. Scaffolding can be used without base plates on concrete or similar hard surfaces, although base plates are always recommended. For surfaces like pavements or tarmac base plates are necessary. For softer or more doubtful surfaces sole boards must be used, beneath a single standard a sole board should be at least {{convert|1000|cm2|in2}} with no dimension less than {{convert|220|mm|in}}, the thickness must be at least {{convert|35|mm|in}}. For heavier duty scaffold much more substantial baulks set in concrete can be required. On uneven ground steps must be cut for the base plates, a minimum step size of around {{convert|450|mm|in}} is recommended. A working platform requires certain other elements to be safe. They must be close-boarded, have double guard rails and toe and stop boards. Safe and secure access must also be provided.\n\n[[File:scaff wp 01.png|frame|center|Scaffolding showing required protection of a working platform with maximum dimensions. Butt-board not visible. No couplers shown]]\n----\n\n===Ties===\n[[File:Holy Trinity Vladimir.jpg|left|thumb|The Holy Trinity Church in [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], with scaffolding wrapped in safety mesh.]]\n\nScaffolds are only rarely independent structures. To provide stability for a scaffolding (at left) framework ties are generally fixed to the adjacent building/fabric/steelwork.\n\nGeneral practice is to attach a tie every 4 m on alternate lifts (traditional scaffolding). Prefabricated System scaffolds require structural connections at all frames - i.e. 2\u20133 m centres (tie patterns must be provided by the System manufacturer/supplier). The ties are coupled to the scaffold as close to the junction of standard and ledger (node point) as possible. Due to recent regulation changes, scaffolding ties must support +/- loads (tie/butt loads) and lateral (shear) loads.\n\nDue to the different nature of structures there is a variety of different ties to take advantage of the opportunities.\n\n''Through ties'' are put through structure openings such as windows. A vertical inside tube crossing the opening is attached to the scaffold by a transom and a crossing horizontal tube on the outside called a bridle tube. The gaps between the tubes and the structure surfaces are packed or wedged with timber sections to ensure a solid fit.\n\n''Box ties'' are used to attach the scaffold to suitable pillars or comparable features. Two additional transoms are put across from the lift on each side of the feature and are joined on both sides with shorter tubes called tie tubes. When a complete box tie is impossible a l-shaped ''lip tie'' can be used to hook the scaffold to the structure, to limit inward movement an additional transom, a ''butt transom'', is placed hard against the outside face of the structure.\n\nSometimes it is possible to use ''anchor ties'' (also called ''bolt ties''), these are ties fitted into holes drilled in the structure. A common type is a ring bolt with an expanding wedge which is then tied to a node point.\n\n[[File:Scaffolding Waverley Station.jpg|thumb|Scaffolding by Balfour & Beatty during refurbishment of the Waverley Station roof, Edinburgh 2011]]\nThe least 'invasive' tie is a ''reveal tie''. These use an opening in the structure but use a tube wedged horizontally in the opening. The reveal tube is usually held in place by a reveal screw pin (an adjustable threaded bar) and protective packing at either end. A transom tie tube links the reveal tube to the scaffold. Reveal ties are not well regarded, they rely solely on friction and need regular checking so it is not recommended that more than half of all ties be reveal ties.\n\nIf it is not possible to use a safe number of ties ''rakers'' can be used. These are single tubes attached to a ledger extending out from the scaffold at an angle of less than 75\u00b0 and securely founded. A transom at the base then completes a triangle back to the base of the main scaffold.\n\n==Bamboo scaffolding==\n[[File:Bamboo scaffolding around a water tower.jpg|thumb|Bamboo scaffolding an under-construction water tower Hainan, China]]\n'''Bamboo scaffolding''' is a type of scaffolding made from [[bamboo]] and widely used in [[construction]] work for centuries.

The bamboo scaffolding material was imported from mainland [[China]]. Bamboo\u2014which matures after three years to the wide diameter and thick skin perfect for scaffolding\u2014came from the [[Shaoxing]] area in [[Guangdong]]. Over the past two decades, firms have had to look to [[Guangxi]] instead. The industry's fear is that one day supplies will be blocked due to export embargoes and environmental concerns. Attempts to import bamboo from [[Thailand]], or switch to synthetic or plastic bamboo, have so far proved unsuccessful.\n\nIn many African countries, notably [[Nigeria]], bamboo scaffolding is still used for small scale construction in urban areas. In rural areas, the use of bamboo scaffolding for construction is common. In fact, bamboo is an essential building and construction commodity in Nigeria; the bamboo materials are transported on heavy trucks and [[Trailer (vehicle)|trailers]] from rural areas (especially the tropical rain forest) to cities and the northern part of Nigeria.\n\nSome of the structures in relaxation and recreation centres, both in urban and rural areas of Nigeria, are put in place using bamboo materials. This is not for reasons of [[poverty]] (especially in the cities) but to add more [[aesthetics]] to these centres. Bamboo materials are still used in the construction of some [[bukas]] (local restaurants) in rural areas.<ref>unpublished journals on The Use of Bamboo in Nigeria by Olaiya Festus, Adult Education Department, University of Ado Ekiti,November 2011.</ref><ref>https://ww.academia.edu/7351624/SCAFFOLDING_PRACTICES_IN_SOME_SELECTED_CITIES_OF_NIGERIA_A_SURVEY_OF_REQUIREMENTS_AND_PROSPECTS_FOR_SPECIALIZED_SUB-CONTRACTORS_BY{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Chiang-Mai Thailand Workers-on-a-bamboo-scaffolding-01.jpg|thumb|Workers on bamboo scaffolding]]\n\n===Specifications===\nForms of bamboo scaffolding include:<ref>http://www.hkicm.org.hk/pdf/HKICM-PNCM2-TW01.pdf</ref>\n* '''Double-row Scaffold'''\nOnly double-row bamboo scaffold is allowed to be used for [[working at height]].\n* '''Nylon Mesh'''\nThe perimeter of bamboo scaffold should be covered by nylon mesh against falling objects.

As such, the scaffold consists only of a single row of standards with a single ledger. The putlogs are transoms - attached to the ledger at one end but integrated into the bricks at the other.\n\nSpacing is the same on a putlog scaffold as on a general purpose scaffold, and ties are still required.\nIn recent years a number of new innovations have meant an increased scope of use for scaffolding, such as ladderbeams for spanning spaces that cannot accommodate standards and the increased use of sheeting and structure to create temporary roofs.\n\n===Pump-jack===\nA pump-jack is a type of portable scaffolding system.

His abusive father Aftab Shakir Ahmed ([[Vijay Raaz]]) brings home a much younger second wife, much to the chagrin of the family. Murad nurtures a fascination for [[rap]] music. His longtime and overtly possessive girlfriend Safeena Firdausi ([[Alia Bhatt]]) is training to be a surgeon and routinely meets him in secret. \n\nForced to work part-time as a chauffeur after his father is injured, Murad starts to write, with his lyrics informed by the inequalities he observes while on the job. Making the acquaintance of local rapper Shrikant \"MC Sher\" Bhosle ([[Siddhant Chaturvedi]]) whom he saw performing in his college fest, he is drawn into performing his lyrics at underground shows and rap battles and eventually uploading a video on YouTube.\n\n[[Berklee College of Music|Berklee College]] student Shweta \"Sky\" Mehta ([[Kalki Koechlin]]), an evolving musician, reaches out to Murad and Sher after seeing the video, offering to collaborate on a new song. The accompanying video, which is shot in Dharavi, rapidly becomes popular. Murad shares an intimate moment with Sky, later lying to Safeena about it. When Safeena finds out, she reacts violently towards Sky by smashing a bottle of beer on her head. \n\nAs a result, she is brought in by the police but is not arrested as Sky doesn't press charges against her. Murad eventually breaks up with Safeena due to her possessive attitude. As Aftab's violence towards him, his brother and his mother escalates, Murad decides to leave home with his mother and brother and work full-time for his uncle Ateeq Khan ([[Vijay Maurya]]).\n\nLater, when Sky expresses her romantic feelings for him, he declines her as he still loves Safeena and decides to reconcile with her. Murad and Sher enter a contest to open for [[Nas]] at his Mumbai concert, and Murad advances to the finals after a successful rap battle. Murad's confidence grows from interacting with rap fans' appreciation of his performances, and he finally stands up to Aftab and Ateeq when they belittle his passion. He later gets back together with Safeena. He goes on to win the contest and becomes one of India's top rappers. The film ends with his friends, family  and Safeena watching him happily as he begins his opening performance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Ranveer Singh]] as Murad Ahmed a.k.a.

His abusive father Aftab Shakir Ahmed ([[Vijay Raaz]]) brings home a much younger second wife, much to the chagrin of the family. Murad nurtures a fascination for [[rap]] music. His longtime and overtly possessive girlfriend Safeena Firdausi ([[Alia Bhatt]]) is training to be a surgeon and routinely meets him in secret. \n\nForced to work part-time as a chauffeur after his father is injured, Murad starts to write, with his lyrics informed by the inequalities he observes while on the job. Making the acquaintance of local rapper Shrikant \"MC Sher\" Bhosle ([[Siddhant Chaturvedi]]) whom he saw performing in his college fest, he is drawn into performing his lyrics at underground shows and rap battles and eventually uploading a video on YouTube.\n\n[[Berklee College of Music|Berklee College]] student Shweta \"Sky\" Mehta ([[Kalki Koechlin]]), an evolving musician, reaches out to Murad and Sher after seeing the video, offering to collaborate on a new song. The accompanying video, which is shot in Dharavi, rapidly becomes popular. Murad shares an intimate moment with Sky, later lying to Safeena about it. When Safeena finds out, she reacts violently towards Sky by smashing a bottle of beer on her head. \n\nAs a result, she is brought in by the police but is not arrested as Sky doesn't press charges against her. Murad eventually breaks up with Safeena due to her possessive attitude. As Aftab's violence towards him, his brother and his mother escalates, Murad decides to leave home with his mother and brother and work full-time for his uncle Ateeq Khan ([[Vijay Maurya]]).\n\nLater, when Sky expresses her romantic feelings for him, he declines her as he still loves Safeena and decides to reconcile with her. Murad and Sher enter a contest to open for [[Nas]] at his Mumbai concert, and Murad advances to the finals after a successful rap battle. Murad's confidence grows from interacting with rap fans' appreciation of his performances, and he finally stands up to Aftab and Ateeq when they belittle his passion. He later gets back together with Safeena. He goes on to win the contest and becomes one of India's top rappers. The film ends with his friends, family  and Safeena watching him happily as he begins his opening performance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Ranveer Singh]] as Murad Ahmed a.k.a.

Despite that censorship, ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' offended the moral sensibilities of British book reviewers, some of whom said that Oscar Wilde merited prosecution for violating the laws guarding public morality. In response, Wilde aggressively defended his novel and art in correspondence with the British press, although he personally made excisions of some of the most controversial material when revising and lengthening the story for book publication the following year.\n\nThe longer and revised version of ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' published in book form in 1891 featured an [[Aphorism|aphoristic]] preface\u2014a defence of the artist's rights and of art for art's sake\u2014based in part on his press defences of the novel the previous year. The content, style, and presentation of the preface made it famous in its own right, as a literary and artistic manifesto. In April 1891, the publishing firm of [[Ward Lock & Co|Ward, Lock and Company]], who had distributed the shorter, more inflammatory, magazine version in England the previous year, published the revised version of ''The Picture of Dorian Gray''.<ref name=\"Publish\">[http://www.turksheadreview.com/library/notes-doriangray.html Notes on The Picture of Dorian Gray] \u2013 An overview of the text, sources, influences, themes, and a summary of ''The Picture of Dorian Gray''</ref>\n\n''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' is the only novel written by Wilde.  It exists in several versions: the 1890 magazine edition (in 13 chapters), with important material deleted before publication by the magazine's editor, [[Joseph Marshall Stoddart|J. M. Stoddart]]; the \"uncensored\" version submitted to ''Lippincott's Monthly Magazine'' for publication (also in 13 chapters), with all of Wilde's original material intact, first published in 2011 by Harvard University Press; and the 1891 book edition (in 20 chapters).<ref>[http://withgoodreasonradio.org/2012/07/the-censorship-of-dorian-gray-With Good Reason radio show, \"The Censorship of 'Dorian Gray' \"]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> As literature of the 19th century, ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' \"pivots on a gothic plot device\" with strong [[#Themes and motifs|themes]] interpreted from ''[[Faust]]''.<ref name=\"gothhorror\">{{cite web |title=Ghost and Horror Fiction |website=GLBTQ Encyclopedia |publisher=glbtq, Inc |location=Chicago, IL |date=2002\u20132006 |archive-url=https://archive.fo/20130102232629/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/ghost_horror.html |archive-date=2 January 2013 |url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/ghost_horror.html |access-date=2017-08-23 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Dorian Gray (character)|Dorian Gray]] is the subject of a full-length portrait in oil by Basil Hallward, an artist impressed and infatuated by Dorian's [[Aesthetics|beauty]]; he believes that Dorian's beauty is responsible for the new mood in his art as a painter. Through Basil, Dorian meets Lord Henry Wotton, and he soon is enthralled by the aristocrat's [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] world view: that beauty and sensual fulfilment are the only things worth pursuing in life.\n\nNewly understanding that his beauty will fade, Dorian expresses the desire to sell his soul, to ensure that the picture, rather than he, will age and fade. The wish is granted, and Dorian pursues a [[libertine]] life of varied amoral experiences while staying young and beautiful; all the while, his portrait ages and records every sin.<ref name=\"gutenberg_20_1\">[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/174 The Picture of Dorian Gray] (Project Gutenberg 20-chapter version), line 3479 et seq. in plain text (Chapter VII).</ref>\n\n==Summary==\n[[File:Doriangray 1945.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Dorian Gray observes the corruption recorded in his portrait, in the film ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945 film)|The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' (1945). Inset painting by [[Ivan Albright]]]]\n''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' begins on a beautiful summer day in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] England, where Lord Henry Wotton, an opinionated man, is observing the sensitive artist Basil Hallward painting the portrait of Dorian Gray, a handsome young man who is Basil's ultimate [[muse]]. While sitting for the painting, Dorian listens to Lord Henry espousing his [[hedonistic]] world view and begins to think that [[Aesthetics|beauty]] is the only aspect of life worth pursuing, prompting Dorian to wish that his portrait would age instead of himself.\n\nUnder Lord Henry's hedonistic influence, Dorian fully explores his sensuality. He discovers the actress Sibyl Vane, who performs [[Shakespeare]] plays in a dingy, working-class theatre. Dorian approaches and courts her, and soon proposes marriage. The enamoured Sibyl calls him \"Prince Charming\", and swoons with the happiness of being loved, but her protective brother, James, warns that if \"Prince Charming\" harms her, he will murder him.\n\nDorian invites Basil and Lord Henry to see Sibyl perform in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. Sibyl, too enamoured with Dorian to act, performs poorly, which makes both Basil and Lord Henry think Dorian has fallen in love with Sibyl because of her beauty instead of her acting talent. Embarrassed, Dorian rejects Sibyl, telling her that acting was her beauty; without that, she no longer interests him. On returning home, Dorian notices that the portrait has changed; his wish has come true, and the man in the portrait bears a subtle sneer of cruelty.\n\nConscience-stricken and lonely, Dorian decides to reconcile with Sibyl, but he is too late, as Lord Henry informs him that Sibyl has killed herself. Dorian then understands that, where his life is headed, lust and beauty shall suffice. Dorian locks the portrait up, and over the following eighteen years, he experiments with every vice, influenced by a morally poisonous French novel that Lord Henry Wotton gave him.\n\nOne night, before leaving for Paris, Basil goes to Dorian's house to ask him about rumours of his self-indulgent [[sensualism]]. Dorian does not deny his debauchery, and takes Basil to see the portrait. The portrait has become so hideous that Basil is only able to identify it as his by the signature he affixes to all of his portraits. Basil is horrified, and beseeches Dorian to pray for salvation. In anger, Dorian blames his fate on Basil and stabs him to death. Dorian then calmly blackmails an old friend, the scientist Alan Campbell, into using his knowledge of chemistry to destroy the body of Basil Hallward. Alan later kills himself.\n\n[[File:Opium smoking 1874.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A 19th-century London opium den (based on fictional accounts of the day)]]\n\nTo escape the guilt of his crime, Dorian goes to an [[opium den]], where James Vane is unknowingly present. James had been seeking vengeance upon Dorian ever since Sibyl killed herself, but had no leads to pursue as the only thing he knew about Dorian was the name Sibyl called him, \"Prince Charming\". In the opium den, however, he hears someone refer to Dorian as \"Prince Charming\", and he accosts Dorian. Dorian deceives James into believing that he is too young to have known Sibyl, who killed herself eighteen years earlier, as his face is still that of a young man. James relents and releases Dorian, but is then approached by a woman from the opium den who reproaches James for not killing Dorian. She confirms that the man was Dorian Gray and explains that he has not aged in eighteen years. James runs after Dorian, but he has gone.\n\nJames then begins to stalk Dorian, causing Dorian to fear for his life. However, during a shooting party, a hunter accidentally kills James Vane, who was lurking in a thicket. On returning to London, Dorian tells Lord Henry that he will live righteously from now on. His new probity begins with deliberately not breaking the heart of the na\u00efve Hetty Merton, his current romantic interest. Dorian wonders if his newly-found goodness has rescinded the corruption in the picture but when he looks at it, he sees only an even uglier image of himself. From that, Dorian understands that his true motives for the self-sacrifice of moral reformation were the vanity and curiosity of his quest for new experiences, along with the desire to restore beauty to the picture.\n\nDeciding that only full [[confession (religion)|confession]] will [[absolve]] him of wrongdoing, Dorian decides to destroy the last vestige of his conscience and the only piece of evidence remaining of his crimes; the picture. In a rage, he takes the knife with which he murdered Basil Hallward and stabs the picture. The servants of the house awaken on hearing a cry from the locked room; on the street, a passerby who also heard the cry, calls the police. On entering the locked room, the servants find an unknown old man stabbed in the heart, his figure withered and decrepit. The servants identify the disfigured corpse by the rings on its fingers, which belonged to Dorian Gray. Beside him, the portrait is now restored to its former appearance of beauty.\n\n==Characters==\n[[Oscar Wilde]] said that, in the novel ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (1891), three of the characters were [[alter ego|reflections]] of himself:\n\n{{quotation|Basil Hallward is what I think I am: Lord Henry is what the world thinks of me: Dorian is what I would like to be\u2014in other ages, perhaps.<ref name=\"The Modern Library Gray\">[http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780553901672 The Modern Library] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929005709/http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780553901672 |date=29 September 2018 }} \u2013 a synopsis of the novel coupled with a short biography of Oscar Wilde. (retrieved 3 November 2009)</ref>}}\n[[File:Doriangray.jpg|thumb|275px|The painter Basil Hallward and the aristocrat Lord Henry Wotton observe the picture of Dorian Gray.]]\n\n;So, the characters of the story are\n* '''[[Dorian Gray (character)|Dorian Gray]]''' \u2013 a handsome, [[narcissistic]] young man enthralled by Lord Henry's \"new\" [[hedonism]]. He indulges in every pleasure and virtually every 'sin', studying its effect upon him, which eventually leads to his death.\n* '''Basil Hallward''' \u2013 a deeply moral man, the painter of the portrait, and infatuated with Dorian, whose patronage realises his potential as an artist. The picture of Dorian Gray is Basil's masterpiece.\n* '''Lord Henry \"Harry\" Wotton''' \u2013 an imperious [[Aristocracy|aristocrat]] and a decadent [[dandy]] who espouses a philosophy of self-indulgent hedonism. Initially Basil's friend, he neglects him for Dorian's beauty. The character of witty Lord Harry is a [[Cultural criticism|critique]] of [[Victorian era#Culture|Victorian culture]] at the ''[[Fin de si\u00e8cle]]'' \u2013 of Britain at the end of the 19th century. Lord Harry's [[Libertinism|libertine]] world view corrupts Dorian, who then successfully emulates him. To the aristocrat Harry, the observant artist Basil says, \"You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.\"  Lord Henry takes pleasure in impressing, influencing, and even misleading his acquaintances (to which purpose he bends his considerable wit and eloquence) but appears not to observe his own hedonistic advice, preferring to study himself with scientific detachment.  His distinguishing feature is total indifference to the consequences of his actions. Scholars generally accept the character is partly inspired by Wilde's friend [[Lord Ronald Gower]].<ref>Wilde, Oscar; Frankel, Nichols (ed.) ''The Picture of Dorian Gray: An Annotated, Uncensored Edition'' The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, London 2011, p68</ref>\n* '''Sibyl Vane''' \u2013 a talented actress and singer, she is a beautiful girl from a poor family with whom Dorian falls in love. Her love for Dorian ruins her acting ability, because she no longer finds pleasure in portraying fictional love as she is now experiencing real love in her life. She kills herself on learning that Dorian no longer loves her; at that, Lord Henry likens her to [[Ophelia]], in ''Hamlet''.\n* '''James Vane''' \u2013 Sibyl's brother, a sailor who leaves for Australia. He is very protective of his sister, especially as their mother cares only for Dorian's money. Believing that Dorian means to harm Sibyl, James hesitates to leave, and promises vengeance upon Dorian if any harm befalls her. After Sibyl's suicide, James becomes obsessed with killing Dorian, and [[Stalking|stalks]] him, but a hunter accidentally kills James. The brother's pursuit of vengeance upon the lover (Dorian Gray), for the death of the sister (Sibyl) parallels that of [[Laertes (Hamlet)|Laertes]] vengeance against Prince Hamlet.\n* '''Alan Campbell''' \u2013 chemist and one-time friend of Dorian who ended their friendship when Dorian's libertine reputation devalued such a friendship. Dorian blackmails Alan into destroying the body of the murdered Basil Hallward; Campbell later shoots himself dead.\n* '''Lord Fermor''' \u2013 Lord Henry's uncle, who tells his nephew, Lord Henry Wotton, about the family [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]] of Dorian Gray.\n* '''Adrian Singleton''' \u2013 A youthful friend of Dorian's, whom he evidently introduced to opium addiction, which induced him to forge a cheque and made him a total outcast from his family and social set.\n* '''Victoria, Lady Henry Wotton''' \u2013 Lord Henry's wife, whom he treats disdainfully; she later divorces him.\n\nThis masterpiece story was written by Charles John Huffam Dickens, one of the renowned authors in this world!\n\n==Allusions==\n\n===''Faust''===\nAbout the literary hero, the author Oscar Wilde said, \"in every first novel the hero is the author as Christ or [[Faust]].\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=s8klNRZBYBAC&pg=PT21&dq=%22in+every+first+novel+the+hero+is+the+author+as+Christ+or+Faust.%22#v=onepage&q=%22in%20every%20first%20novel%20the%20hero%20is%20the%20author%20as%20Christ%20or%20Faust.%22&f=false |title=The Picture of Dorian Gray |publisher=Magnum Books |date=1969 |author=Oscar Wilde |accessdate=30 May 2011}}</ref> As in the legend of ''Faust'', in ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' a temptation (ageless beauty) is placed before the protagonist, which he indulges. In each story, the protagonist entices a beautiful woman to love him, and then destroys her life. In the preface to the novel (1891), Wilde said that the notion behind the tale is \"old in the history of literature\", but was a thematic subject to which he had \"given a new form\".<ref name=\"DorianGray Preface\">''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (Penguin Classics) \u2013 Preface</ref>\n\nUnlike the academic ''Faust'', the gentleman Dorian makes no [[deal with the Devil]], who is represented by the cynical hedonist Lord Henry, who presents the temptation that will corrupt the [[virtue]] and innocence that Dorian possesses at the start of the story. Throughout, Lord Henry appears unaware of the effect of his actions upon the young man; and so frivolously advises Dorian, that \"the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing.\"<ref name=\"DorianGray Chapter II\">''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (Penguin Classics) \u2013 Chapter II</ref> As such, the devilish Lord Henry is \"leading Dorian into an unholy pact, by manipulating his innocence and insecurity.\"<ref name=\"Devil's Advocate\">[http://education.yahoo.com/homework_help/cliffsnotes/the_picture_of_dorian_gray/10.html The Picture of Dorian Gray] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207212634/http://education.yahoo.com/homework_help/cliffsnotes/the_picture_of_dorian_gray/10.html |date=7 February 2009 }} \u2013 a summary of and a commentary on Chapter II of ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (retrieved 29 July 2006)</ref>\n\n===Shakespeare===\nIn the preface to ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (1891), Wilde speaks of the sub-human [[Caliban]] character from ''[[The Tempest]]''. In chapter five, he writes: \"He felt as if he had come to look for Miranda and had been met by Caliban\". When Dorian tells Lord Henry about his new love Sibyl Vane, he mentions the Shakespeare plays in which she has acted, and refers to her by the name of the heroine of each play. Later, Dorian speaks of his life by quoting [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]], a privileged character who impels his potential suitor ([[Ophelia]]) to suicide, and prompts her brother (Laertes) to swear mortal revenge.\n\n===Joris-Karl Huysmans===\nThe anonymous \"poisonous French novel\" that leads Dorian to his fall is a thematic variant of ''[[\u00c0 rebours]]'' (1884), by [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]]. In the biography, ''Oscar Wilde'' (1989), the literary critic [[Richard Ellmann]] said that: <blockquote>Wilde does not name the book, but at his trial he conceded that it was, or almost [was], Huysmans's ''\u00c0 rebours'' ... to a correspondent, he wrote that he had played a \"fantastic variation\" upon ''\u00c0 rebours'', and someday must write it down. The references in ''Dorian Gray'' to specific chapters are deliberately inaccurate.<ref>Ellmann, ''Oscar Wilde'' (Vintage, 1988), p. 316</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Literary significance==\n\n===Possible Disraeli influence===\n\nSome commentators have suggested that ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' was influenced by the British Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]]'s (anonymously published) first novel ''[[Vivian Grey]]'' (1826) as, \"a kind of homage from one outsider to another.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=McCrum|first1=Robert|title=The 100 best novels: No 11 \u2013 Sybil by Benjamin Disraeli (1845)|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/02/sybil-benjamin-disraeli-100-best-novels|newspaper=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=6 June 2016|date=2 December 2013}}</ref> The name of Dorian Gray's love interest, Sibyl Vane, may be a modified fusion of the title of Disraeli's best known novel ([[Sybil (novel)|''Sybil'']]) and Vivian Grey's love interest Violet Fane, who, like Sibyl Vane, dies tragically.<ref name=\"Disraeli (1853)\">{{cite book|last1=Disraeli|first1=Benjamin|title=Vivian Grey|date=1826|publisher=Longmans, Green and Co|location=London|pages=263\u20135|edition=1853 version}}</ref> There is also a scene in ''Vivian Grey'' in which the eyes in the portrait of a \"beautiful being\" move when its subject dies.<ref>Disraeli (1853) p101-2</ref>\n\n===Publication history===\n''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' originally was a [[novella]] submitted to ''[[Lippincott's Monthly Magazine]]'' for serial publication. In 1889, J. M. Stoddart, an editor for Lippincott, was in London to solicit novellas to publish in the magazine. On 30 August 1889, Stoddart dined with Oscar Wilde, [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] and [[T. P.

British reviewers condemned the novel's immorality, and said condemnation was so controversial that the [[W H Smith]] publishing house withdrew every copy of the July 1890 issue of ''Lippincott's Monthly Magazine'' from its bookstalls in railway stations.<ref name=\"FrankelIntro\" />\nConsequent to the harsh criticism of the 1890 magazine edition, Wilde ameliorated the [[homoerotic]] references, to simplify the moral message of the story.<ref name=\"FrankelIntro\" /> In the magazine edition (1890), Basil tells Lord Henry how he \"worships\" Dorian, and begs him not to \"take away the one person that makes my life absolutely lovely to me.\" In the magazine edition, Basil concentrates upon love, whereas, in the book edition (1891), Basil concentrates upon his art, saying to Lord Henry, \"the one person who gives my art whatever charm it may possess: my life as an artist depends on him.\"\n\nThe magazine edition of ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (1890) was expanded from thirteen to twenty chapters; and the magazine edition's final chapter was divided into two chapters, the nineteenth and twentieth chapters of the book edition of ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (1891). Wilde's textual additions were about \"fleshing out of Dorian as a character\" and providing details of his ancestry that made his \"psychological collapse more prolonged and more convincing.\"<ref name=\"DorianGray ANoteOnTheText\">''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (Penguin Classics) \u2013 A Note on the Text</ref>\n\nThe introduction of the James Vane character to the story develops the socio-economic background of the Sibyl Vane character, thus emphasising Dorian's selfishness and foreshadowing James's accurate perception of the essentially immoral character of Dorian Gray; thus, he correctly deduced Dorian's dishonourable intent towards Sibyl. The sub-plot about James Vane's dislike of Dorian gives the novel a Victorian tinge of class struggle. With such textual changes, Oscar Wilde meant to diminish the moralistic controversy about the novel ''The Picture of Dorian Gray''.\n\n===Preface===\nConsequent to the harsh criticism of the magazine edition of the novel, the textual revisions to ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' included a preface in which Wilde addressed the criticisms and defended the reputation of his novel.<ref name=\"Preface Quote\">[http://www.gradesaver.com/classicnotes/titles/dorian/section2.html GraderSave: ClassicNote] \u2013 a summary and analysis of the book and its preface (retrieved 5 July 2006)</ref> To communicate how the novel should be read, in the preface, Wilde explains the role of the artist in society, the purpose of art, and the value of beauty. It traces Wilde's cultural exposure to [[Taoism]] and to the philosophy of Chuang Ts\u01d4 ([[Zhuang Zhou]]). Earlier, before writing the preface, Wilde had written a book review of [[Herbert Giles]]'s translation of the work of Zhuang Zhou. The preface was first published in the 1891 edition of the novel; nonetheless, by June 1891, Wilde was defending ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' against accusations that it was a bad book.<ref>''The Letters of Oscar Wilde'', Merlin Holland and Rupert Hart-Davis, eds., Henry Holt (2000), {{ISBN|0-8050-5915-6}}; and ''The Artist as Critic'', Richard Ellmann, ed., University of Chicago (1968), {{ISBN|0-226-89764-8}} \u2013 containing Wilde's book review of Giles's translation, and Chuang Ts\u01d4 (Zhuang Zhou) is incorrectly identified as [[Confucius]].

Despite that censorship, ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' offended the moral sensibilities of British book reviewers, some of whom said that Oscar Wilde merited prosecution for violating the laws guarding public morality. In response, Wilde aggressively defended his novel and art in correspondence with the British press, although he personally made excisions of some of the most controversial material when revising and lengthening the story for book publication the following year.\n\nThe longer and revised version of ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' published in book form in 1891 featured an [[Aphorism|aphoristic]] preface\u2014a defence of the artist's rights and of art for art's sake\u2014based in part on his press defences of the novel the previous year. The content, style, and presentation of the preface made it famous in its own right, as a literary and artistic manifesto.

Through Basil, Dorian meets Lord Henry Wotton, and he soon is enthralled by the aristocrat's [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] world view: that beauty and sensual fulfilment are the only things worth pursuing in life.\n\nNewly understanding that his beauty will fade, Dorian expresses the desire to sell his soul, to ensure that the picture, rather than he, will age and fade. The wish is granted, and Dorian pursues a [[libertine]] life of varied amoral experiences while staying young and beautiful; all the while, his portrait ages and records every sin.<ref name=\"gutenberg_20_1\">[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/174 The Picture of Dorian Gray] (Project Gutenberg 20-chapter version), line 3479 et seq. in plain text (Chapter VII).</ref>\n\n==Summary==\n[[File:Doriangray 1945.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Dorian Gray observes the corruption recorded in his portrait, in the film ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945 film)|The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' (1945). Inset painting by [[Ivan Albright]]]]\n''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' begins on a beautiful summer day in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] England, where Lord Henry Wotton, an opinionated man, is observing the sensitive artist Basil Hallward painting the portrait of Dorian Gray, a handsome young man who is Basil's ultimate [[muse]]. While sitting for the painting, Dorian listens to Lord Henry espousing his [[hedonistic]] world view and begins to think that [[Aesthetics|beauty]] is the only aspect of life worth pursuing, prompting Dorian to wish that his portrait would age instead of himself.\n\nUnder Lord Henry's hedonistic influence, Dorian fully explores his sensuality. He discovers the actress Sibyl Vane, who performs [[Shakespeare]] plays in a dingy, working-class theatre. Dorian approaches and courts her, and soon proposes marriage. The enamoured Sibyl calls him \"Prince Charming\", and swoons with the happiness of being loved, but her protective brother, James, warns that if \"Prince Charming\" harms her, he will murder him.\n\nDorian invites Basil and Lord Henry to see Sibyl perform in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. Sibyl, too enamoured with Dorian to act, performs poorly, which makes both Basil and Lord Henry think Dorian has fallen in love with Sibyl because of her beauty instead of her acting talent. Embarrassed, Dorian rejects Sibyl, telling her that acting was her beauty; without that, she no longer interests him. On returning home, Dorian notices that the portrait has changed; his wish has come true, and the man in the portrait bears a subtle sneer of cruelty.\n\nConscience-stricken and lonely, Dorian decides to reconcile with Sibyl, but he is too late, as Lord Henry informs him that Sibyl has killed herself. Dorian then understands that, where his life is headed, lust and beauty shall suffice. Dorian locks the portrait up, and over the following eighteen years, he experiments with every vice, influenced by a morally poisonous French novel that Lord Henry Wotton gave him.\n\nOne night, before leaving for Paris, Basil goes to Dorian's house to ask him about rumours of his self-indulgent [[sensualism]]. Dorian does not deny his debauchery, and takes Basil to see the portrait. The portrait has become so hideous that Basil is only able to identify it as his by the signature he affixes to all of his portraits. Basil is horrified, and beseeches Dorian to pray for salvation. In anger, Dorian blames his fate on Basil and stabs him to death. Dorian then calmly blackmails an old friend, the scientist Alan Campbell, into using his knowledge of chemistry to destroy the body of Basil Hallward. Alan later kills himself.\n\n[[File:Opium smoking 1874.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A 19th-century London opium den (based on fictional accounts of the day)]]\n\nTo escape the guilt of his crime, Dorian goes to an [[opium den]], where James Vane is unknowingly present. James had been seeking vengeance upon Dorian ever since Sibyl killed herself, but had no leads to pursue as the only thing he knew about Dorian was the name Sibyl called him, \"Prince Charming\". In the opium den, however, he hears someone refer to Dorian as \"Prince Charming\", and he accosts Dorian. Dorian deceives James into believing that he is too young to have known Sibyl, who killed herself eighteen years earlier, as his face is still that of a young man. James relents and releases Dorian, but is then approached by a woman from the opium den who reproaches James for not killing Dorian. She confirms that the man was Dorian Gray and explains that he has not aged in eighteen years. James runs after Dorian, but he has gone.\n\nJames then begins to stalk Dorian, causing Dorian to fear for his life. However, during a shooting party, a hunter accidentally kills James Vane, who was lurking in a thicket. On returning to London, Dorian tells Lord Henry that he will live righteously from now on. His new probity begins with deliberately not breaking the heart of the na\u00efve Hetty Merton, his current romantic interest. Dorian wonders if his newly-found goodness has rescinded the corruption in the picture but when he looks at it, he sees only an even uglier image of himself. From that, Dorian understands that his true motives for the self-sacrifice of moral reformation were the vanity and curiosity of his quest for new experiences, along with the desire to restore beauty to the picture.\n\nDeciding that only full [[confession (religion)|confession]] will [[absolve]] him of wrongdoing, Dorian decides to destroy the last vestige of his conscience and the only piece of evidence remaining of his crimes; the picture. In a rage, he takes the knife with which he murdered Basil Hallward and stabs the picture. The servants of the house awaken on hearing a cry from the locked room; on the street, a passerby who also heard the cry, calls the police. On entering the locked room, the servants find an unknown old man stabbed in the heart, his figure withered and decrepit. The servants identify the disfigured corpse by the rings on its fingers, which belonged to Dorian Gray. Beside him, the portrait is now restored to its former appearance of beauty.\n\n==Characters==\n[[Oscar Wilde]] said that, in the novel ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (1891), three of the characters were [[alter ego|reflections]] of himself:\n\n{{quotation|Basil Hallward is what I think I am: Lord Henry is what the world thinks of me: Dorian is what I would like to be\u2014in other ages, perhaps.<ref name=\"The Modern Library Gray\">[http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780553901672 The Modern Library] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929005709/http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780553901672 |date=29 September 2018 }} \u2013 a synopsis of the novel coupled with a short biography of Oscar Wilde. (retrieved 3 November 2009)</ref>}}\n[[File:Doriangray.jpg|thumb|275px|The painter Basil Hallward and the aristocrat Lord Henry Wotton observe the picture of Dorian Gray.]]\n\n;The characters of the story are\n* '''[[Dorian Gray (character)|Dorian Gray]]''' \u2013 a handsome, [[narcissistic]] young man enthralled by Lord Henry's \"new\" [[hedonism]]. He indulges in every pleasure and virtually every 'sin', studying its effect upon him, which eventually leads to his death.\n* '''Basil Hallward''' \u2013 a deeply moral man, the painter of the portrait, and infatuated with Dorian, whose patronage realises his potential as an artist. The picture of Dorian Gray is Basil's masterpiece.\n* '''Lord Henry \"Harry\" Wotton''' \u2013 an imperious [[Aristocracy|aristocrat]] and a decadent [[dandy]] who espouses a philosophy of self-indulgent hedonism. Initially Basil's friend, he neglects him for Dorian's beauty. The character of witty Lord Harry is a [[Cultural criticism|critique]] of [[Victorian era#Culture|Victorian culture]] at the ''[[Fin de si\u00e8cle]]'' \u2013 of Britain at the end of the 19th century. Lord Harry's [[Libertinism|libertine]] world view corrupts Dorian, who then successfully emulates him. To the aristocrat Harry, the observant artist Basil says, \"You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.\"  Lord Henry takes pleasure in impressing, influencing, and even misleading his acquaintances (to which purpose he bends his considerable wit and eloquence) but appears not to observe his own hedonistic advice, preferring to study himself with scientific detachment.  His distinguishing feature is total indifference to the consequences of his actions. Scholars generally accept the character is partly inspired by Wilde's friend [[Lord Ronald Gower]].<ref>Wilde, Oscar; Frankel, Nichols (ed.) ''The Picture of Dorian Gray: An Annotated, Uncensored Edition'' The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, London 2011, p68</ref>\n* '''Sibyl Vane''' \u2013 a talented actress and singer, she is a beautiful girl from a poor family with whom Dorian falls in love. Her love for Dorian ruins her acting ability, because she no longer finds pleasure in portraying fictional love as she is now experiencing real love in her life. She kills herself on learning that Dorian no longer loves her; at that, Lord Henry likens her to [[Ophelia]], in ''Hamlet''.\n* '''James Vane''' \u2013 Sibyl's brother, a sailor who leaves for Australia. He is very protective of his sister, especially as their mother cares only for Dorian's money. Believing that Dorian means to harm Sibyl, James hesitates to leave, and promises vengeance upon Dorian if any harm befalls her. After Sibyl's suicide, James becomes obsessed with killing Dorian, and [[Stalking|stalks]] him, but a hunter accidentally kills James. The brother's pursuit of vengeance upon the lover (Dorian Gray), for the death of the sister (Sibyl) parallels that of [[Laertes (Hamlet)|Laertes]] vengeance against Prince Hamlet.\n* '''Alan Campbell''' \u2013 chemist and one-time friend of Dorian who ended their friendship when Dorian's libertine reputation devalued such a friendship. Dorian blackmails Alan into destroying the body of the murdered Basil Hallward; Campbell later shoots himself dead.\n* '''Lord Fermor''' \u2013 Lord Henry's uncle, who tells his nephew, Lord Henry Wotton, about the family [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]] of Dorian Gray.\n* '''Adrian Singleton''' \u2013 A youthful friend of Dorian's, whom he evidently introduced to opium addiction, which induced him to forge a cheque and made him a total outcast from his family and social set.\n* '''Victoria, Lady Henry Wotton''' \u2013 Lord Henry's wife, whom he treats disdainfully; she later divorces him.\n\n==Allusions==\n\n===''Faust''===\nAbout the literary hero, the author Oscar Wilde said, \"in every first novel the hero is the author as Christ or [[Faust]].\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=s8klNRZBYBAC&pg=PT21&dq=%22in+every+first+novel+the+hero+is+the+author+as+Christ+or+Faust.%22#v=onepage&q=%22in%20every%20first%20novel%20the%20hero%20is%20the%20author%20as%20Christ%20or%20Faust.%22&f=false |title=The Picture of Dorian Gray |publisher=Magnum Books |date=1969 |author=Oscar Wilde |accessdate=30 May 2011}}</ref> As in the legend of ''Faust'', in ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' a temptation (ageless beauty) is placed before the protagonist, which he indulges. In each story, the protagonist entices a beautiful woman to love him, and then destroys her life. In the preface to the novel (1891), Wilde said that the notion behind the tale is \"old in the history of literature\", but was a thematic subject to which he had \"given a new form\".<ref name=\"DorianGray Preface\">''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (Penguin Classics) \u2013 Preface</ref>\n\nUnlike the academic ''Faust'', the gentleman Dorian makes no [[deal with the Devil]], who is represented by the cynical hedonist Lord Henry, who presents the temptation that will corrupt the [[virtue]] and innocence that Dorian possesses at the start of the story. Throughout, Lord Henry appears unaware of the effect of his actions upon the young man; and so frivolously advises Dorian, that \"the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing.\"<ref name=\"DorianGray Chapter II\">''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (Penguin Classics) \u2013 Chapter II</ref> As such, the devilish Lord Henry is \"leading Dorian into an unholy pact, by manipulating his innocence and insecurity.\"<ref name=\"Devil's Advocate\">[http://education.yahoo.com/homework_help/cliffsnotes/the_picture_of_dorian_gray/10.html The Picture of Dorian Gray] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207212634/http://education.yahoo.com/homework_help/cliffsnotes/the_picture_of_dorian_gray/10.html |date=7 February 2009 }} \u2013 a summary of and a commentary on Chapter II of ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (retrieved 29 July 2006)</ref>\n\n===Shakespeare===\nIn the preface to ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (1891), Wilde speaks of the sub-human [[Caliban]] character from ''[[The Tempest]]''. In chapter five, he writes: \"He felt as if he had come to look for Miranda and had been met by Caliban\". When Dorian tells Lord Henry about his new love Sibyl Vane, he mentions the Shakespeare plays in which she has acted, and refers to her by the name of the heroine of each play. Later, Dorian speaks of his life by quoting [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]], a privileged character who impels his potential suitor ([[Ophelia]]) to suicide, and prompts her brother (Laertes) to swear mortal revenge.\n\n===Joris-Karl Huysmans===\nThe anonymous \"poisonous French novel\" that leads Dorian to his fall is a thematic variant of ''[[\u00c0 rebours]]'' (1884), by [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]]. In the biography, ''Oscar Wilde'' (1989), the literary critic [[Richard Ellmann]] said that: <blockquote>Wilde does not name the book, but at his trial he conceded that it was, or almost [was], Huysmans's ''\u00c0 rebours'' ... to a correspondent, he wrote that he had played a \"fantastic variation\" upon ''\u00c0 rebours'', and someday must write it down. The references in ''Dorian Gray'' to specific chapters are deliberately inaccurate.<ref>Ellmann, ''Oscar Wilde'' (Vintage, 1988), p. 316</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Literary significance==\n\n===Possible Disraeli influence===\n\nSome commentators have suggested that ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' was influenced by the British Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]]'s (anonymously published) first novel ''[[Vivian Grey]]'' (1826) as, \"a kind of homage from one outsider to another.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=McCrum|first1=Robert|title=The 100 best novels: No 11 \u2013 Sybil by Benjamin Disraeli (1845)|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/02/sybil-benjamin-disraeli-100-best-novels|newspaper=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=6 June 2016|date=2 December 2013}}</ref> The name of Dorian Gray's love interest, Sibyl Vane, may be a modified fusion of the title of Disraeli's best known novel ([[Sybil (novel)|''Sybil'']]) and Vivian Grey's love interest Violet Fane, who, like Sibyl Vane, dies tragically.<ref name=\"Disraeli (1853)\">{{cite book|last1=Disraeli|first1=Benjamin|title=Vivian Grey|date=1826|publisher=Longmans, Green and Co|location=London|pages=263\u20135|edition=1853 version}}</ref> There is also a scene in ''Vivian Grey'' in which the eyes in the portrait of a \"beautiful being\" move when its subject dies.<ref>Disraeli (1853) p101-2</ref>\n\n===Publication history===\n''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' originally was a [[novella]] submitted to ''[[Lippincott's Monthly Magazine]]'' for serial publication. In 1889, J. M. Stoddart, an editor for Lippincott, was in London to solicit novellas to publish in the magazine. On 30 August 1889, Stoddart dined with Oscar Wilde, [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] and [[T. P. Gill]]<ref>Oscar Wilde, ''Selected Letters'' ed Hart-Davis, R Oxford University Press, 1979, p95</ref> at the [[Langham Hotel, London|Langham Hotel]], and commissioned novellas from each writer.<ref name=\"FrankelIntro\">{{cite book |last=Frankel |first=Nicholas |editor1-first=Oscar |editor1-last=Wilde |editor1-link=Oscar Wilde |title=The Picture of Dorian Gray: An Annotated, Uncensored Edition |year=2011 |origyear=1890 |publisher=Belknap Press ([[Harvard University Press]]) |location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] |isbn=978-0-674-05792-0 |pages=38\u201364 |chapter=Textual Introduction}}</ref> Conan Doyle promptly submitted ''[[The Sign of the Four]]'' (1890) to Stoddart, but Wilde was more dilatory; Conan Doyle's second Sherlock Holmes novel was published in the February 1890 edition of ''Lippincott's Monthly Magazine'', yet Stoddart did not receive Wilde's manuscript for ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' until 7 April 1890, nine months after having commissioned the novel from him.<ref name=\"FrankelIntro\" />\n\n[[File:The title card of an 1891 print of The Picture of Dorian Gray, by Oscar Wilde.png|thumb|right|230px|The [[title page]] of the [[Ward Lock & Co]] 1891 edition of ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' with decorative lettering, designed by [[Charles Ricketts]]]]\nThe literary merits of ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' impressed Stoddart, but, as an editor, he told the publisher, George Lippincott, \"in its present condition there are a number of things an innocent woman would make an exception to. ...\"<ref name=\"FrankelIntro\" /> Among the pre-publication deletions that Stoddart and his editors made to the text of Wilde's original manuscript were: (i) passages alluding to homosexuality and to homosexual desire; (ii) all references to the fictional book title ''Le Secret de Raoul'' and its author, Catulle Sarrazin; and (iii) all \"mistress\" references to Gray's lovers, Sibyl Vane and Hetty Merton.<ref name=\"FrankelIntro\" />\n\n''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' was published on 20 June 1890, in the July issue of ''Lippincott's Monthly Magazine''. British reviewers condemned the novel's immorality, and said condemnation was so controversial that the [[W H Smith]] publishing house withdrew every copy of the July 1890 issue of ''Lippincott's Monthly Magazine'' from its bookstalls in railway stations.<ref name=\"FrankelIntro\" />\nConsequent to the harsh criticism of the 1890 magazine edition, Wilde ameliorated the [[homoerotic]] references, to simplify the moral message of the story.<ref name=\"FrankelIntro\" /> In the magazine edition (1890), Basil tells Lord Henry how he \"worships\" Dorian, and begs him not to \"take away the one person that makes my life absolutely lovely to me.\" In the magazine edition, Basil concentrates upon love, whereas, in the book edition (1891), Basil concentrates upon his art, saying to Lord Henry, \"the one person who gives my art whatever charm it may possess: my life as an artist depends on him.\"\n\nThe magazine edition of ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (1890) was expanded from thirteen to twenty chapters; and the magazine edition's final chapter was divided into two chapters, the nineteenth and twentieth chapters of the book edition of ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (1891). Wilde's textual additions were about \"fleshing out of Dorian as a character\" and providing details of his ancestry that made his \"psychological collapse more prolonged and more convincing.\"<ref name=\"DorianGray ANoteOnTheText\">''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (Penguin Classics) \u2013 A Note on the Text</ref>\n\nThe introduction of the James Vane character to the story develops the socio-economic background of the Sibyl Vane character, thus emphasising Dorian's selfishness and foreshadowing James's accurate perception of the essentially immoral character of Dorian Gray; thus, he correctly deduced Dorian's dishonourable intent towards Sibyl. The sub-plot about James Vane's dislike of Dorian gives the novel a Victorian tinge of class struggle. With such textual changes, Oscar Wilde meant to diminish the moralistic controversy about the novel ''The Picture of Dorian Gray''.\n\n===Preface===\nConsequent to the harsh criticism of the magazine edition of the novel, the textual revisions to ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' included a preface in which Wilde addressed the criticisms and defended the reputation of his novel.<ref name=\"Preface Quote\">[http://www.gradesaver.com/classicnotes/titles/dorian/section2.html GraderSave: ClassicNote] \u2013 a summary and analysis of the book and its preface (retrieved 5 July 2006)</ref> To communicate how the novel should be read, in the preface, Wilde explains the role of the artist in society, the purpose of art, and the value of beauty. It traces Wilde's cultural exposure to [[Taoism]] and to the philosophy of Chuang Ts\u01d4 ([[Zhuang Zhou]]). Earlier, before writing the preface, Wilde had written a book review of [[Herbert Giles]]'s translation of the work of Zhuang Zhou. The preface was first published in the 1891 edition of the novel; nonetheless, by June 1891, Wilde was defending ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' against accusations that it was a bad book.<ref>''The Letters of Oscar Wilde'', Merlin Holland and Rupert Hart-Davis, eds., Henry Holt (2000), {{ISBN|0-8050-5915-6}}; and ''The Artist as Critic'', Richard Ellmann, ed., University of Chicago (1968), {{ISBN|0-226-89764-8}} \u2013 containing Wilde's book review of Giles's translation, and Chuang Ts\u01d4 (Zhuang Zhou) is incorrectly identified as [[Confucius]]. Wilde's book review of Giles's translation was published in ''The Speaker'' magazine of 8 February 1890.</ref>\n\nIn the essay ''The Artist as Critic'', Oscar Wilde said that:\n\n{{quotation|The honest ratepayer and his healthy family have no doubt often mocked at the dome-like forehead of the philosopher, and laughed over the strange perspective of the landscape that lies beneath him.

Yet, most of the criticism was personal, attacking Wilde for being a hedonist with a distorted view of conventional morality of Victorian Britain. In the 30 June 1890 issue of the ''[[Daily Chronicle (United Kingdom)|Daily Chronicle]]'', the book critic said that Wilde's novel contains \"one element ... which will taint every young mind that comes in contact with it.\" In the 5 July 1890 issue of the ''[[Scots Observer]]'', a reviewer asked \"Why must Oscar Wilde 'go grubbing in muck-heaps?'\" In response to such criticism, Wilde obscured the homoeroticism of the story and expanded the personal background of the characters.<ref name=\"Addition\">[http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitNote/id-144,pageNum-2.html CliffsNotes:The Picture of Dorian Gray] \u2013 an introduction and overview the book (retrieved 5 July 2006) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319200835/http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitNote/id-144,pageNum-2.html |date=19 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dorian Grey Chapitre Quatre.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Original manuscript of the opening of chapter four]]\n\n===Textual revisions===\nAfter the initial publication of the magazine edition of ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (1890), Wilde expanded the text from 13 to 20 chapters and obscured the [[homoerotic]] themes of the story.<ref>{{cite web |website=listverse.com| url=http://listverse.com/2013/01/14/deleted-book-chapters/|date=14 January 2013| title=10 Deleted Chapters that Transformed Famous Books|author=Symon, Evan V.}}</ref> In the novel version of ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (1891), chapters 3, 5, and 15 to 18, inclusive, are new; and chapter 13 of the magazine edition was divided, and became chapters 19 and 20 of the novel edition.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mdoege.github.io/Dorian_Gray_diff/ |title=Differences between the 1890 and 1891 editions of \"Dorian Gray\" |publisher=Github.io |date= |accessdate=25 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226202802/http://mdoege.github.io/Dorian_Gray_diff/ |archive-date=26 December 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1895, at his [[Oscar Wilde#Trials|trials]], Oscar Wilde said he revised the text of ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' because of letters sent to him by the cultural critic [[Walter Pater]].<ref>Lawler, Donald L., ''An Inquiry into Oscar Wilde's Revisions of 'The Picture of Dorian Gray{{'}}'' (New York: Garland, 1988)</ref>\n\n'''Passages revised for the novel'''\n* (Basil about Dorian) \"He has stood as Paris in dainty armour, and as Adonis with huntsman's cloak and polished boar-spear.

Large-scale commercial fishing is also known as '''[[industrial fishing]]'''.

A study taken on some small family-owned commercial fishing companies showed that they adapted to continue to earn a living but not necessarily make a large profit.<ref name=ender />  It is the adaptability of the fishermen and their methods that cause some concern for fishery managers and researchers; they say that for those reasons, the sustainability of the marine ecosystems could be in danger of being ruined.<ref name=ender />\n\nCommercial fishermen harvest a wide variety of animals, ranging from [[tuna]], [[cod]], [[carp]], and [[salmon]] to [[shrimp]], [[krill]], [[lobster]], [[clam]]s, [[squid]], and [[crab]], in various [[fishery|fisheries]] for these species. There are large and important fisheries worldwide for various species of fish, [[mollusk]]s, [[crustacean]]s, and [[echinoderm]]s. However, a very small number of species support the majority of the world's fisheries of these species are [[herring]], [[cod]], [[anchovy]], [[tuna]], [[flounder]], [[Mullet (fish)|mullet]], [[squid]], [[shrimp]], [[salmon]], [[crab]], [[lobster]], [[oyster]] and [[scallop]]s. All except these last four provided a worldwide catch of well over a [[million]] [[tonne]]s in 1999, with [[herring]] and [[sardine]]s together providing a catch of over 22 million metric tons in 1999. Many other species are fished in smaller numbers.\n\nThe industry, in 2006, also managed to generate over 185 billion dollars in sales and also provide over two million jobs in the United States, according to an economic report released by NOAA's Fisheries Service.<ref name=NOAA>{{cite web |title=New Economic Report Finds Commercial and Recreational Saltwater Fishing Generated More Than Two Million Jobs |url=http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2009/20090105_nmfseconomics.html |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |access-date=19 Apr 2012}}</ref> Commercial fishing may offer an abundance of jobs, but the pay varies from boat to boat, season to season. Crab fisherman Cade Smith was quoted in an article by ''Business Week'' as saying, \"There was always a top boat where the crew members raked in $50,000 during the three- to five-day king crab season\u2014or $100,000 for the longer snow crab season\".<ref name=Miller>{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Kerry|title=Worst Jobs with the Best Pay|url=http://www.businessweek.com/careers/content/sep2006/ca20060914_736742.htm|publisher=Businessweek|access-date=19 Apr 2012}}</ref>  That may be true, but there are also the boats who don't do well; Smith said later in the same article that his worst season left him with a loss of 500 dollars.<ref name=\"Miller\"/>\n\nMany people working in commercial fishing are self-employed, with some or all of their pay dependent on the proceeds from the sale of the fish caught.  In the UK, the technical term for this is share fisherman,<ref>{{cite web|title=Share fisherman: Income Tax and National Insurance contributions|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/share-fisherman-income-tax-and-national-insurance-contributions|website=GOV.UK|publisher=HM Revenue and Customs|access-date=21 August 2017}}</ref> which refers to anyone working without an employment contract, on a boat manned by more than one person, and relying for their livelihood at least partly on a share of the profits or gross sales of the fishing boat's catch.\n\nA 2009 paper in ''Science'' estimates, for the first time, the total world fish biomass as somewhere between 0.8 and 2.0 billion tonnes.<ref>Wilson RW, Millero FJ, Taylor JR, Walsh PJ, Christensen V, Jennings S, Grosell M (2009) [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/323/5912/359 \"Contribution of Fish to the Marine Inorganic Carbon Cycle\"] ''Science'', '''323''' (5912) 359\u2013362.</ref><ref>[http://www.physorg.com/news151251277.html Researcher gives first-ever estimate of worldwide fish biomass and impact on climate change] ''[[PhysOrg.com]]'', 15 January 2009.</ref>\n\nIn 2016, of the 171 million tonnes of fish caught, about 88 percent or over 151 million tonnes were utilized for direct human consumption.

A commercial fishing enterprise may vary from one man with a small [[boat]] with [[Net casting|hand-casting nets]] or a few [[Lobster pot|pot traps]], to a huge fleet of [[fishing trawler|trawler]]s processing tons of fish every day.\n\nCommercial fishing gears in use today include surrounding [[Fishing net|nets]] (e.g. purse [[Seine fishing|seine]]), seine nets (e.g. beach seine), [[trawl]]s (e.g. [[Bottom trawling|bottom trawl]]), dredges, [[Fish hook|hooks]] and lines (e.g. [[Long-line fishing|long line]] and [[Hand-line fishing|handline]]), lift nets, [[gillnet]]s, entangling nets, Pole and Line, and  [[Fishing trap|traps]] They help in developing poverty;)\n\nCommercial fishing gear is specifically designed and updated to avoid catching certain species of animal that is unwanted or endangered.

CFIVSA regulations focus primarily on saving lives after the loss of a vessel and not on preventing vessels from capsizing or sinking, falls overboard, or injuries on deck. CFIVSA regulations require that commercial fishing vessels carry various equipment (e.g., life rafts, radio beacons, and immersion suits) depending on the size of the vessel and the area in which it operates.<ref name=\"mmwr\" /> Not all commercial fishermen follow safety regulations and advice. One study of Maine fishermen found that less than 25% of the fishermen interviewed had recent training in first aid or CPR, only 75% of the boats had survival suits and only 36% had a survival craft.<ref name=\"Davis\" /> Even the ships that did have the necessary equipment did not consistently have a captain that fully understood how to use the safety equipment.<ref name=\"Davis\" />\n\n== Environmental risk ==\nThe [[ocean]]s cover nearly two thirds of the Earth's surface, and are continuously threatened by human behaviors and practices. By taking so many fish from the seas, humans have managed to remove entire links from the [[marine food chain]]. This causes a chain effect, leading to an overall upset of the delicate ecological balance.\n\n[[Sharks]] are one of the ocean's most threatened species because they are mistakenly caught by vessels searching for fish, and end up getting tossed back into the ocean dead or dying<ref name=\"Empowerment\">{{Cite web|title = Commercial Fishing {{!}} Food Empowerment Project|url = http://www.foodispower.org/commercial-fishing/|website = www.foodispower.org|access-date = 2015-12-04}}</ref> This disappearance of sharks has enabled prey animals like rays to multiply, which alters the food chain.\n{{see also|List of threatened sharks}}\n\n[[Bycatch]] is the industry term for what they consider \"unwanted or economically-worthless aquatic animals who are unintentionally caught using destructively indiscriminate fishing methods like [[longline fishing|longlines]] and [[driftnet]]s, which generally target marketable marine creatures such as [[tuna]] and [[swordfish]]\"<ref name=\"Empowerment\" /> There are also billions of other animals that are killed in this manner every year such as: [[sea turtles]], marine mammals, and [[sea birds]]. Between 1990 and 2008, it was estimated that 8.5 million sea turtles were fatally caught in nets or on longlines as bycatch.\n\n[[Coral reef]]s are [[biodiversity]]-rich ecosystems which provide habitat for millions of aquatic species such as sponges, star fish, jellyfish, sea turtles, etc. Unfortunately, reef ecosystems are highly sensitive to chemical, temperature, and population changes. There has been an increasing disappearance of large predators such as [[barracuda]], [[Nassau grouper]]s, and sharks<ref name=\"Empowerment\" /> This makes the reefs more vulnerable to invasion by non-native species.\n\n[[Fish farming]] is the raising of fish for food in underwater enclosures, otherwise known as [[aquaculture]]. There are environmental hazards such as waste, damage to ecosystems, and negative effects on humans. Because they are so densely packed together, the fecal matter that accumulates can create [[algal bloom]]s, or deadly parasites and viruses that thrive on the filthy environment. These can infect wild fish that swim near the enclosure, or whole colonies of fish if an infected farm fish escapes the enclosure.\n\n[[Overfishing]] occurs because fish are captured at a faster rate than they can reproduce. Both advanced fishing technologies and increased demand for fish have resulted in overfishing. The Food and Agricultural Organization has reported that \"about 25 percent of the world's captured fish end up thrown overboard because they are caught unintentionally, are illegal market species, or are of inferior quality and size\" <ref>{{Cite web|title = The Threats of Overfishing: Consequences at the Commercial Level|url = http://dujs.dartmouth.edu/winter-2012/the-threats-of-overfishing-consequences-at-the-commercial-level#.VmEJTnarSM8|website = DUJS Online|access-date = 2015-12-04}}</ref> It should not go unnoticed that overfishing has caused more ecological extinction than any other human influence on coastal ecosystems.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Fishing industry]]\n*[[List of canneries]]\n* [[List of seafood companies]]\n* [[List of harvested aquatic animals by weight]]\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = In brief, The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture, 2018\n| author = FAO\n| publisher = FAO\n| page numbers = \n| source = \n| documentURL = http://www.fao.org/3/ca0191en/ca0191en.pdf\n| license statement URL = https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:In_brief,_The_State_of_World_Fisheries_and_Aquaculture,_2018.pdf\n| license = CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Commercial fishing}}\n* [http://www.worldfishing.net/ World Fishing magazine Information about the global fishing industry]\n*{{Curlie|/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Meat_and_Seafood/Seafood/Commercial_Harvesting|Commercial fishing}}\n* [http://www.worldfishingtoday.com/ WorldFishingToday.com Internet site for and about the commercial fishing ]\n* [http://www.trawlerphotos.co.uk/forums/ Trawler Photos is a forum and online gallery of photographs and images covering everything to do with commercial fishing]\n* [http://www.fiskerforum.dk/ FiskerForum.dk Internet site about commercial fishing, in Scandinavian language ]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080411044716/http://www.mcdonald.cam.ac.uk/projects/Medieval_Fishing/ Medieval Origins of Commercial Sea Fishing Project]\n* [http://www.blueplanetsociety.org/   the Blue Planet Society]\n* [http://www.nationalfisherman.com/ National Fisherman magazine]\n* [http://www.trawlerpictures.net Trawler Pictures - A Forum and Gallery Dedicated to Commercial Trawlers]\n* [http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100504080401/http://go.worldbank.org/MGUTHSY7U0 The Sunken Billions: The Economic Justification for Fisheries Reform]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110714235353/http://www.olrac.com/knowledge-base Scientific articles about Commercial Fishing]\n\n{{commercial fish topics|state=collapsed}}\n{{fishing industry topics|state=expanded}}\n{{fisheries and fishing}}\n\n[[Category:Fishing industry| ]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Greetsiel 33 Poseidon 01.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Commercial [[Crab fisheries|crab fishing]] at the [[Elbe]] River in June 2007.]]\n'''Commercial fishing''' is the activity of catching [[fish]] and other [[seafood]] for [[Commerce|commercial]] [[Profit (economics)|profit]], mostly from [[wild fisheries]].

The major fishing industries are not only owned by major corporations but by small families as well.<ref name=ender>{{cite journal|last=Endter-Wada |first=Joanna | last2 = Keenan | first2 = Sean | name-list-format = vanc |title=Adaptations by Long-Term Commercial Fishing Families in the California Bight: Coping with Changing Coastal Ecological and Social Systems |journal=Human Organization |year=2005 |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=225\u2013237|doi=10.17730/humo.64.3.0c2uc20ct6mgdmjf }}</ref> The industry has had to adapt through the years in order to keep earning a profit.  A study taken on some small family-owned commercial fishing companies showed that they adapted to continue to earn a living but not necessarily make a large profit.<ref name=ender />  It is the adaptability of the fishermen and their methods that cause some concern for fishery managers and researchers; they say that for those reasons, the sustainability of the marine ecosystems could be in danger of being ruined.<ref name=ender />\n\nCommercial fishermen harvest a wide variety of animals, ranging from [[tuna]], [[cod]], [[carp]], and [[salmon]] to [[shrimp]], [[krill]], [[lobster]], [[clam]]s, [[squid]], and [[crab]], in various [[fishery|fisheries]] for these species. There are large and important fisheries worldwide for various species of fish, [[mollusk]]s, [[crustacean]]s, and [[echinoderm]]s. However, a very small number of species support the majority of the world's fisheries of these species are [[herring]], [[cod]], [[anchovy]], [[tuna]], [[flounder]], [[Mullet (fish)|mullet]], [[squid]], [[shrimp]], [[salmon]], [[crab]], [[lobster]], [[oyster]] and [[scallop]]s. All except these last four provided a worldwide catch of well over a [[million]] [[tonne]]s in 1999, with [[herring]] and [[sardine]]s together providing a catch of over 22 million metric tons in 1999. Many other species are fished in smaller numbers.\n\nThe industry, in 2006, also managed to generate over 185 billion dollars in sales and also provide over two million jobs in the United States, according to an economic report released by NOAA's Fisheries Service.<ref name=NOAA>{{cite web |title=New Economic Report Finds Commercial and Recreational Saltwater Fishing Generated More Than Two Million Jobs |url=http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2009/20090105_nmfseconomics.html |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |access-date=19 Apr 2012}}</ref> Commercial fishing may offer an abundance of jobs, but the pay varies from boat to boat, season to season. Crab fisherman Cade Smith was quoted in an article by ''Business Week'' as saying, \"There was always a top boat where the crew members raked in $50,000 during the three- to five-day king crab season\u2014or $100,000 for the longer snow crab season\".<ref name=Miller>{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Kerry|title=Worst Jobs with the Best Pay|url=http://www.businessweek.com/careers/content/sep2006/ca20060914_736742.htm|publisher=Businessweek|access-date=19 Apr 2012}}</ref>  That may be true, but there are also the boats who don't do well; Smith said later in the same article that his worst season left him with a loss of 500 dollars.<ref name=\"Miller\"/>\n\nMany people working in commercial fishing are self-employed, with some or all of their pay dependent on the proceeds from the sale of the fish caught.  In the UK, the technical term for this is share fisherman,<ref>{{cite web|title=Share fisherman: Income Tax and National Insurance contributions|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/share-fisherman-income-tax-and-national-insurance-contributions|website=GOV.UK|publisher=HM Revenue and Customs|access-date=21 August 2017}}</ref> which refers to anyone working without an employment contract, on a boat manned by more than one person, and relying for their livelihood at least partly on a share of the profits or gross sales of the fishing boat's catch.\n\nA 2009 paper in ''Science'' estimates, for the first time, the total world fish biomass as somewhere between 0.8 and 2.0 billion tonnes.<ref>Wilson RW, Millero FJ, Taylor JR, Walsh PJ, Christensen V, Jennings S, Grosell M (2009) [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/323/5912/359 \"Contribution of Fish to the Marine Inorganic Carbon Cycle\"] ''Science'', '''323''' (5912) 359\u2013362.</ref><ref>[http://www.physorg.com/news151251277.html Researcher gives first-ever estimate of worldwide fish biomass and impact on climate change] ''[[PhysOrg.com]]'', 15 January 2009.</ref>\n\nIn 2016, of the 171 million tonnes of fish caught, about 88 percent or over 151 million tonnes were utilized for direct human consumption.

CFIVSA regulations focus primarily on saving lives after the loss of a vessel and not on preventing vessels from capsizing or sinking, falls overboard, or injuries on deck. CFIVSA regulations require that commercial fishing vessels carry various equipment (e.g., life rafts, radio beacons, and immersion suits) depending on the size of the vessel and the area in which it operates.<ref name=\"mmwr\" /> Not all commercial fishermen follow safety regulations and advice. One study of Maine fishermen found that less than 25% of the fishermen interviewed had recent training in first aid or CPR, only 75% of the boats had survival suits and only 36% had a survival craft.<ref name=\"Davis\" /> Even the ships that did have the necessary equipment did not consistently have a captain that fully understood how to use the safety equipment.<ref name=\"Davis\" />\n\n== Environmental risk ==\nThe [[ocean]]s cover nearly two thirds of the Earth's surface, and are continuously threatened by human behaviors and practices. By taking so many fish from the seas, humans have managed to remove entire links from the [[marine food chain]]. This causes a chain effect, leading to an overall upset of the delicate ecological balance.\n\n[[Sharks]] are one of the ocean's most threatened species because they are mistakenly caught by vessels searching for fish, and end up getting tossed back into the ocean dead or dying<ref name=\"Empowerment\">{{Cite web|title = Commercial Fishing {{!}} Food Empowerment Project|url = http://www.foodispower.org/commercial-fishing/|website = www.foodispower.org|access-date = 2015-12-04}}</ref> This disappearance of sharks has enabled prey animals like rays to multiply, which alters the food chain.\n{{see also|List of threatened sharks}}\n\n[[Bycatch]] is the industry term for what they consider \"unwanted or economically-worthless aquatic animals who are unintentionally caught using destructively indiscriminate fishing methods like [[longline fishing|longlines]] and [[driftnet]]s, which generally target marketable marine creatures such as [[tuna]] and [[swordfish]]\"<ref name=\"Empowerment\" /> There are also billions of other animals that are killed in this manner every year such as: [[sea turtles]], marine mammals, and [[sea birds]]. Between 1990 and 2008, it was estimated that 8.5 million sea turtles were fatally caught in nets or on longlines as bycatch.\n\n[[Coral reef]]s are [[biodiversity]]-rich ecosystems which provide habitat for millions of aquatic species such as sponges, star fish, jellyfish, sea turtles, etc. Unfortunately, reef ecosystems are highly sensitive to chemical, temperature, and population changes. There has been an increasing disappearance of large predators such as [[barracuda]], [[Nassau grouper]]s, and sharks<ref name=\"Empowerment\" /> This makes the reefs more vulnerable to invasion by non-native species.\n\n[[Fish farming]] is the raising of fish for food in underwater enclosures, otherwise known as [[aquaculture]]. There are environmental hazards such as waste, damage to ecosystems, and negative effects on humans. Because they are so densely packed together, the fecal matter that accumulates can create [[algal bloom]]s, or deadly parasites and viruses that thrive on the filthy environment. These can infect wild fish that swim near the enclosure, or whole colonies of fish if an infected farm fish escapes the enclosure.\n\n[[Overfishing]] occurs because fish are captured at a faster rate than they can reproduce. Both advanced fishing technologies and increased demand for fish have resulted in overfishing. The Food and Agricultural Organization has reported that \"about 25 percent of the world's captured fish end up thrown overboard because they are caught unintentionally, are illegal market species, or are of inferior quality and size\" <ref>{{Cite web|title = The Threats of Overfishing: Consequences at the Commercial Level|url = http://dujs.dartmouth.edu/winter-2012/the-threats-of-overfishing-consequences-at-the-commercial-level#.VmEJTnarSM8|website = DUJS Online|access-date = 2015-12-04}}</ref> It should not go unnoticed that overfishing has caused more ecological extinction than any other human influence on coastal ecosystems.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Fishing industry]]\n*[[List of canneries]]\n* [[List of seafood companies]]\n* [[List of harvested aquatic animals by weight]]\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = In brief, The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture, 2018\n| author = FAO\n| publisher = FAO\n| page numbers = \n| source = \n| documentURL = http://www.fao.org/3/ca0191en/ca0191en.pdf\n| license statement URL = https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:In_brief,_The_State_of_World_Fisheries_and_Aquaculture,_2018.pdf\n| license = CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Commercial fishing}}\n* [http://www.worldfishing.net/ World Fishing magazine Information about the global fishing industry]\n*{{Curlie|/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Meat_and_Seafood/Seafood/Commercial_Harvesting|Commercial fishing}}\n* [http://www.worldfishingtoday.com/ WorldFishingToday.com Internet site for and about the commercial fishing ]\n* [http://www.trawlerphotos.co.uk/forums/ Trawler Photos is a forum and online gallery of photographs and images covering everything to do with commercial fishing]\n* [http://www.fiskerforum.dk/ FiskerForum.dk Internet site about commercial fishing, in Scandinavian language ]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080411044716/http://www.mcdonald.cam.ac.uk/projects/Medieval_Fishing/ Medieval Origins of Commercial Sea Fishing Project]\n* [http://www.blueplanetsociety.org/   the Blue Planet Society]\n* [http://www.nationalfisherman.com/ National Fisherman magazine]\n* [http://www.trawlerpictures.net Trawler Pictures - A Forum and Gallery Dedicated to Commercial Trawlers]\n* [http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100504080401/http://go.worldbank.org/MGUTHSY7U0 The Sunken Billions: The Economic Justification for Fisheries Reform]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110714235353/http://www.olrac.com/knowledge-base Scientific articles about Commercial Fishing]\n\n{{commercial fish topics|state=collapsed}}\n{{fishing industry topics|state=expanded}}\n{{fisheries and fishing}}\n\n[[Category:Fishing industry| ]]\n", "name_user": "24.51.101.12", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_fishing"}
