In 1965, the school was registered as a company and was designated by the [[University of London]] as an institution having recognised teachers. In 1966, the first Executive Development Programme was launched, followed by the Senior Executive Programme. The same year, a full-time MSc degree was also launched, with Sheila Cross enrolling as the School's first female student. In 1968, the School inaugurated the Sloan Fellowship MSc programme, which was the first one outside of the US. 17 students were enrolled and the programme was funded by the Alfred P. Sloan foundation. The first doctoral programme was established in 1969 and in 1970 Her Majesty [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] opened the School's [[Regent's Park]] campus. The first PhD was awarded in 1974, and that year women made up over 15% of the student body for the first time. In 1983, the first part-time MBA programme was held under the direction of Sir Andrew Likierman, a former Dean of the School. In 1986, the school officially became the ''London Business School'' and was incorporated by [[Royal charter|Royal Charter]], which gave LBS the right to confer and grant degrees. In 1992, the School was given the Queen's Award for Export in recognition of providing educational services to managers and companies worldwide. The following year, the school started its first Masters in Finance programme and in 2001, the EMBA-Global degree programme in partnership with the [[Columbia Business School]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.london.edu/about/facts/history#.VuX0SlMrLaY|title=LBS History|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007 a new campus was opened in [[Dubai]] to offer both Executive MBA and Executive Education Programmes. In 2009, the school started two new programmes: The EMBA-Global Asia, in partnership with the [[University of Hong Kong]] and [[Columbia Business School]], and the Masters in Management (MiM). In 2012, the school acquired Marylebone Town Hall and restored it with the objective of expanding its teaching facilities by 70 per cent.<ref name=\"LBS Expansion\"/> The building was renamed \"The Sammy Ofer Centre\" in honour of a generous donor, the Ofer Family, who made a gift for the development of the building, which was opened in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thecampaign.london.edu/developing-old-Marylebone-town-hall/index.html|title=Sammy Ofer Centre|website=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312011214/https://thecampaign.london.edu/developing-old-marylebone-town-hall/index.html|archive-date=12 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2016, LBS launched a new programme, the Masters in Financial Analysis, aimed at recent graduates who wish to pursue a career in finance, and acquired the lease of the neighbouring building of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaenocologists, which it will occupy in 2020.\n\nWith the objective of increasing its size, the school organised a \u00a3100 million funding campaign. By the beginning of 2016, it had raised \u00a398 million, \u00a340 million of which will be used to renovate the Marylebone Town Hall, with \u00a328 million for research, \u00a318 million in scholarships for students, \u00a310 million to increase the school's endowment, and \u00a34 million to improve technology across the school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thecampaign.london.edu/home/index.html|title=Funding campaign|website=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220101627/https://thecampaign.london.edu/home/index.html|archive-date=20 February 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> By June 2016, the school had raised \u00a3125 million, including two \u00a325 million gifts from alumni [[Jim Ratcliffe]] and [[Idan Ofer]].<ref name=\"ftraiseslbsmoules\">{{cite news|last1=Moules|first1=Jonathan|title=London Business School raises \u00a3125m in first fundraising|url=https://next.ft.com/content/b97a1762-316b-11e6-bda0-04585c31b153|accessdate=16 June 2016|work=Financial Times|date=15 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Fran\u00e7ois Ortalo-Magn\u00e9]], the French-born former Dean of the [[Wisconsin School of Business]], succeeded Sir Andrew Likierman as Dean in August 2017.<ref name=\"ftlbsappoints\">{{cite news|last1=Vina|first1=Gonzalo|title=LBS appoints Fran\u00e7ois Ortalo-Magn\u00e9 as dean|url=https://www.ft.com/content/8ee0659e-5284-11e6-9664-e0bdc13c3bef|accessdate=25 March 2017|work=Financial Times|date=25 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Campus==\nThe campus is located in [[Marylebone]], on the perimeter of [[Regent's Park]]. The main building, designed by [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]], along with the entire area of Regents Park, was originally built as 26 terraced houses in 1822\u201323.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london.edu/theschool/campusservices.html|title=Campus services|work=london.edu|accessdate=31 January 2015}}</ref> There are ten pointed cupolas along the roof line, and the fa\u00e7ade is adorned with Corinthian columns.\n\nLBS maintains a number of facilities, including a sports centre, restaurant, three cafes and a library, all dedicated for the exclusive use of its community. There is also a privately run pub, 'The Windsor Castle' attached to the campus. Most classrooms for the MBA are located in the Sainsbury Wing, the centre of the terrace, most of which are 100-student [[amphitheatre]] rooms.\n\nThere is no accommodation on campus for students in full-time programmes, although there are rooms on-campus for visiting faculty and [[executive education]] participants. Most students choose to live in nearby private residential buildings or in students halls of residence such as the [[International Students House, London]].\n\nLBS is expanding its campus in central London. The business school has redeveloped the Old Marylebone Town Hall into classrooms and offices as the Sammy Ofer Centre.  It will further expand it in 2020 (see above).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london.edu/newsandevents/news/2013/09/Landmark_%C2%A325_million_gift_for_London_Business_School%E2%80%99s_Old_Marylebone_Town_Hall_1695.html|title=News|work=london.edu|accessdate=31 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:LBS campus 2.jpg|350px|thumbnail|left|The Sussex Palace, main campus in London]]\n\n[[File:Sammy Ofer Center.jpg|340px|thumbnail|center|The Marylebone Town Hall, second campus in London]]\n\n== Organisation and administration ==\n\n=== List of the London Business School Deans ===\nList of the Deans from 1965 to today:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.london.edu/about/people/the-dean#.VuMh6FMrK1t|title=LBS Deans|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Starting year\n!Ending year\n!Name\n|-\n|1965\n|1972\n|Dr. Arthur Earle\n|-\n|1972\n|1984\n|Professor Sir James Ball\n|-\n|1984\n|1989\n|Professor [[Peter G.

In 1965, the school was registered as a company and was designated by the [[University of London]] as an institution having recognised teachers. In 1966, the first Executive Development Programme was launched, followed by the Senior Executive Programme. The same year, a full-time MSc degree was also launched, with Sheila Cross enrolling as the School's first female student. In 1968, the School inaugurated the Sloan Fellowship MSc programme, which was the first one outside of the US. 17 students were enrolled and the programme was funded by the Alfred P. Sloan foundation. The first doctoral programme was established in 1969 and in 1970 Her Majesty [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] opened the School's [[Regent's Park]] campus. The first PhD was awarded in 1974, and that year women made up over 15% of the student body for the first time. In 1983, the first part-time MBA programme was held under the direction of Sir Andrew Likierman, a former Dean of the School. In 1986, the school officially became the ''London Business School'' and was incorporated by [[Royal charter|Royal Charter]], which gave LBS the right to confer and grant degrees. In 1992, the School was given the Queen's Award for Export in recognition of providing educational services to managers and companies worldwide. The following year, the school started its first Masters in Finance programme and in 2001, the EMBA-Global degree programme in partnership with the [[Columbia Business School]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.london.edu/about/facts/history#.VuX0SlMrLaY|title=LBS History|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007 a new campus was opened in [[Dubai]] to offer both Executive MBA and Executive Education Programmes. In 2009, the school started two new programmes: The EMBA-Global Asia, in partnership with the [[University of Hong Kong]] and [[Columbia Business School]], and the Masters in Management (MiM). In 2012, the school acquired Marylebone Town Hall and restored it with the objective of expanding its teaching facilities by 70 per cent.<ref name=\"LBS Expansion\"/> The building was renamed \"The Sammy Ofer Centre\" in honour of a generous donor, the Ofer Family, who made a gift for the development of the building, which was opened in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thecampaign.london.edu/developing-old-Marylebone-town-hall/index.html|title=Sammy Ofer Centre|website=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312011214/https://thecampaign.london.edu/developing-old-marylebone-town-hall/index.html|archive-date=12 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2016, LBS launched a new programme, the Masters in Financial Analysis, aimed at recent graduates who wish to pursue a career in finance, and acquired the lease of the neighbouring building of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaenocologists, which it will occupy in 2020.\n\nWith the objective of increasing its size, the school organised a \u00a3100 million funding campaign. By the beginning of 2016, it had raised \u00a398 million, \u00a340 million of which will be used to renovate the Marylebone Town Hall, with \u00a328 million for research, \u00a318 million in scholarships for students, \u00a310 million to increase the school's endowment, and \u00a34 million to improve technology across the school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thecampaign.london.edu/home/index.html|title=Funding campaign|website=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220101627/https://thecampaign.london.edu/home/index.html|archive-date=20 February 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> By June 2016, the school had raised \u00a3125 million, including two \u00a325 million gifts from alumni [[Jim Ratcliffe]] and [[Idan Ofer]].<ref name=\"ftraiseslbsmoules\">{{cite news|last1=Moules|first1=Jonathan|title=London Business School raises \u00a3125m in first fundraising|url=https://next.ft.com/content/b97a1762-316b-11e6-bda0-04585c31b153|accessdate=16 June 2016|work=Financial Times|date=15 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Fran\u00e7ois Ortalo-Magn\u00e9]], the French-born former Dean of the [[Wisconsin School of Business]], succeeded Sir Andrew Likierman as Dean in August 2017.<ref name=\"ftlbsappoints\">{{cite news|last1=Vina|first1=Gonzalo|title=LBS appoints Fran\u00e7ois Ortalo-Magn\u00e9 as dean|url=https://www.ft.com/content/8ee0659e-5284-11e6-9664-e0bdc13c3bef|accessdate=25 March 2017|work=Financial Times|date=25 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Campus==\nThe campus is located in [[Marylebone]], on the perimeter of [[Regent's Park]].

There is also a privately run pub, 'The Windsor Castle' attached to the campus. Most classrooms for the MBA are located in the Sainsbury Wing, the centre of the terrace, most of which are 100-student [[amphitheatre]] rooms.\n\nThere is no accommodation on campus for students in full-time programmes, although there are rooms on-campus for visiting faculty and [[executive education]] participants. Most students choose to live in nearby private residential buildings or in students halls of residence such as the [[International Students House, London]].\n\nLBS is expanding its campus in central London. The business school has redeveloped the Old Marylebone Town Hall into classrooms and offices as the Sammy Ofer Centre.  It will further expand it in 2020 (see above).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london.edu/newsandevents/news/2013/09/Landmark_%C2%A325_million_gift_for_London_Business_School%E2%80%99s_Old_Marylebone_Town_Hall_1695.html|title=News|work=london.edu|accessdate=31 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:LBS campus 2.jpg|350px|thumbnail|left|The Sussex Palace, main campus in London]]\n\n[[File:Sammy Ofer Center.jpg|340px|thumbnail|center|The Marylebone Town Hall, second campus in London]]\n\n== Organisation and administration ==\n\n=== List of the London Business School Deans ===\nList of the Deans from 1965 to today:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.london.edu/about/people/the-dean#.VuMh6FMrK1t|title=LBS Deans|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Starting year\n!Ending year\n!Name\n|-\n|1965\n|1972\n|Dr. Arthur Earle\n|-\n|1972\n|1984\n|Professor Sir James Ball\n|-\n|1984\n|1989\n|Professor [[Peter G.

In Hong Kong, [[Hong Kong Immigration Department]] takes charge of issuing passports. In Macau, [[Identification Services Bureau]] does the same role. The SAR passports and travel documents are issued solely by the government of the SARs, and the designs differ greatly from that of the regular PRC passport, albeit all three passports bear the same country and nationality code, CHN, meaning that the bearer holds the People's Republic of China nationality, as well as the message from [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (China)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the PRC]].\n\nSome countries classify Chinese nationals with SAR passports as '''Hong Kong citizens''' or '''Macau citizens''' for visa issuing purpose, other than the ordinary '''Chinese citizens''' classifications. Holders of SAR passports enjoy visa-free entry to many more countries than holders of regular PRC passports.\n\nWhile the SAR passports and travel documents are endorsed by China, mainland ports of entry controlled by the [[Ministry of Public Security (China)|Ministry of Public Security]] do not accept those documents for entrance into Mainland China. MPS requires SAR residents of Chinese nationality to use a [[Home Return Permit]] or [[Chinese Travel Document]] for SAR residents residing overseas. Also, SAR passports are not required when travelling between two SARs, but residents should bring their permanent residence IDs.\n\nChinese nationals who are not permanent residents of Hong Kong ''AND'' are without [[Household registration system|household registration]] in Mainland China are issued [[Hong Kong Document of Identity for Visa Purposes]], and of Macau [[Macao Special Administrative Region Travel Permit]] or [[Visit Permit for Resident of Macao to HKSAR]].\n\n==Non-passport travel documents==\nThe following travel documents are also issued by mainland China to Chinese nationals who may or may not qualify for a Chinese passport for various reasons:\n\n===Chinese Travel Document===\n{{main|Chinese Travel Document}}\n* Chinese nationals (i.e. any person who qualifies for Chinese (People's Republic of China, PRC) nationality under the [[Chinese Nationality Law]] which includes most nationals of [[Taiwan]] or ROC) abroad who do not qualify for a PRC passport can be issued a [[Chinese Travel Document]] from PRC Embassies and Consulates outside Mainland China, including:\n** Children born to Chinese parents abroad who derive Chinese nationality from their parents through ''[[jus sanguinis]]'';\n** [[Nationality law of the Republic of China|ROC nationals]] residing abroad, including [[nationals without household registration]], wishing to visit Mainland China or Hong Kong and do not have a [[Taiwan Compatriot Permit]];\n*** Journeys to Hong Kong require a separate application for Hong Kong Entry Permit, affixed on the Chinese Travel Document.\n** Residents of [[Special administrative regions of China]] wishing to visit Mainland China and do not have a [[Home Return Permit]];\n** Chinese nationals who have lost their Chinese passports, HKSAR passports or MSAR passports while abroad.\n\n===Exit-Entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macau===\n{{main|Exit-Entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macau}}\nThe Exit-Entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macau, also known as the Two-way Permit, is issued to Chinese nationals with hukou who only wish to visit Hong Kong and Macau.\n\n===Permit for Proceeding to Hong Kong and Macao===\n{{main|People's Republic of China Permit for Proceeding to Hong Kong and Macao}}\nThe Permit for Proceeding to Hong Kong and Macao, also known as the One-way Permit, is issued to Chinese nationals who are settling in Hong Kong or Macau and have relinquished their Chinese residency (hukou). After their initial entry to Hong Kong or Macau, they are considered as SAR residents and are permanently ineligible for an ordinary Chinese passport, and later they will be eligible for SAR passports if they acquire a permanent resident status in the respective SARs.\n\n===Travel Permit to and from Taiwan===\nThe '''Travel Permit to and from Taiwan''', colloquially known as Mainland Compatriot Permit or Mainland Resident Travel Permit, is issued to Chinese nationals with [[hukou]] in [[Mainland China]] by [[Ministry of Public Security (China)|Ministry of Public Security]], to those who wish to travel directly between Mainland China and [[Taiwan]]. Holders of the permit are required to obtain exit endorsements issued by MPS and [[Exit & Entry Permit (Republic of China)|Exit and Entry Permit]] issued by Taiwanese authorities prior to travelling.\n\n==Self-Service Immigration System (e-Channel)==\nHolders of Chinese biometric Passports are eligible to use the Self-Service Immigration System, or e-Channel. E-Channel are located throughout numerous international airports in Mainland China (including these top 10 busiest international gateways: [[Beijing Capital International Airport]], [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport]], [[Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport]], [[Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport]] and [[Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport]]) as well as land border crossing checkpoints in [[Shenzhen]] and [[Zhuhai]]. e-Channel was first introduced for self-entry, i.e. for Chinese biometric passport holders return to China from Outside destinations. In order to use the e-Channel, they must hold biometric passports with their fingerprint data pre-recorded on the biometric chip. If their biometric passports do not contain fingerprint data, they must first register with [[China Immigration Inspection]] (CII) at land border checkpoints or international airports to be eligible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcia.com.cn/news/news/140825/news1035.shtml|date=November 23, 2012|accessdate=July 2, 2015|title=\u7ec6\u8bf4\u9996\u90fd\u673a\u573a\u8fb9\u9632\u81ea\u52a9\u901a\u5173|publisher=BCIA|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704104920/http://www.bcia.com.cn/news/news/140825/news1035.shtml|archive-date=July 4, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nStarting from August 19, 2016, passengers are able to use the e-Gates in terminal 2 of Beijing Capital International Airport to complete exit procedures from China as well.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/politics/2016-08/20/c_129243603.htm|title=\u9996\u90fd\u673a\u573a\u81ea\u52a9\u901a\u5173\u51fa\u5883 \u6700\u5feb6\u79d2-\u65b0\u534e\u7f51|website=news.xinhuanet.com|access-date=2016-09-06}}</ref>\n\nStarting from Dec 1, 2017, Shanghai international airports including PVG and SHA both have e-Channel for exit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.163.com/17/1201/13/D4IS59OV00018AOQ.html|title=\u4e0a\u6d77\u542f\u752826\u6761\u51fa\u5883\u8fb9\u68c0\u81ea\u52a9\u901a\u5173\u901a\u9053|last=\u7f51\u6613|website=news.163.com|access-date=2017-12-02}}</ref>\n\n===Eligibility===\nThe extended list of eligible travellers is:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://xw.kunming.cn/a/2016-08/20/content_4339106.htm|title=\u8fb9\u68c0\u6269\u5927\u81ea\u52a9\u901a\u5173\u4eba\u5458\u8303\u56f4 10\u7c7b\u65c5\u5ba2\u4ece\u6606\u660e\u51fa\u5165\u58835\u79d2\u53ef\u901a\u5173|website=\u6606\u660e\u4fe1\u606f\u6e2f|access-date=2016-09-06}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nRegistration with CII not required:\n* Holders of biometric passports that contain fingerprint data;\n* Holders of the new biometric [[Two-way Permit]]s with valid entry endorsements that contain fingerprint data.\n\nRegistration with CII required:\n* Holders of the booklet-style Two-way Permits with multiple-entry endorsements;\n* Holders of Travel Permit to and from Taiwan for Mainland Residents booklet with multiple-exit endorsements;\n* Holders of Exit and Entry Permits that are valid for one year and multiple entries (only for the specific port of entry that they have registered with);\n* Holders of [[Home Return Permit]]s;\n* Holders of [[Taiwan Compatriot Permit]]s;\n* Foreign nationals with their passports and Chinese Permanent Resident cards;\n* Foreign nationals with their biometric passports and residence permits with a validity of more than 6 months; and\n* Flight crew members serving scheduled flights who are either Chinese or visa-exempt nationals, or non-visa-exempt nationals holding crew or work visas or residence permits that are valid for at least 1 year.\n\n==Visa requirements==\n{{Main|Visa requirements for Chinese citizens}}\n[[File:Visa requirements for Chinese citizens holding ordinary and ordinary passports for public affairs and Two-way and Exit & Entry permits.png|alt=|thumb|816x816px|Visa-free travel for PRC citizens holding ordinary or public affairs passports]]\nVisa requirements for Chinese citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of the People's Republic of China.

In Hong Kong, [[Hong Kong Immigration Department]] takes charge of issuing passports. In Macau, [[Identification Services Bureau]] does the same role. The SAR passports and travel documents are issued solely by the government of the SARs, and the designs differ greatly from that of the regular PRC passport, albeit all three passports bear the same country and nationality code, CHN, meaning that the bearer holds the People's Republic of China nationality, as well as the message from [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (China)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the PRC]].\n\nSome countries classify Chinese nationals with SAR passports as '''Hong Kong citizens''' or '''Macau citizens''' for visa issuing purpose, other than the ordinary '''Chinese citizens''' classifications. Holders of SAR passports enjoy visa-free entry to many more countries than holders of regular PRC passports.\n\nWhile the SAR passports and travel documents are endorsed by China, mainland ports of entry controlled by the [[Ministry of Public Security (China)|Ministry of Public Security]] do not accept those documents for entrance into Mainland China. MPS requires SAR residents of Chinese nationality to use a [[Home Return Permit]] or [[Chinese Travel Document]] for SAR residents residing overseas. Also, SAR passports are not required when travelling between two SARs, but residents should bring their permanent residence IDs.\n\nChinese nationals who are not permanent residents of Hong Kong ''AND'' are without [[Household registration system|household registration]] in Mainland China are issued [[Hong Kong Document of Identity for Visa Purposes]], and of Macau [[Macao Special Administrative Region Travel Permit]] or [[Visit Permit for Resident of Macao to HKSAR]].\n\n==Non-passport travel documents==\nThe following travel documents are also issued by mainland China to Chinese nationals who may or may not qualify for a Chinese passport for various reasons:\n\n===Chinese Travel Document===\n{{main|Chinese Travel Document}}\n* Chinese nationals (i.e. any person who qualifies for Chinese (People's Republic of China, PRC) nationality under the [[Chinese Nationality Law]] which includes most nationals of [[Taiwan]] or ROC) abroad who do not qualify for a PRC passport can be issued a [[Chinese Travel Document]] from PRC Embassies and Consulates outside Mainland China, including:\n** Children born to Chinese parents abroad who derive Chinese nationality from their parents through ''[[jus sanguinis]]'';\n** [[Nationality law of the Republic of China|ROC nationals]] residing abroad, including [[nationals without household registration]], wishing to visit Mainland China or Hong Kong and do not have a [[Taiwan Compatriot Permit]];\n*** Journeys to Hong Kong require a separate application for Hong Kong Entry Permit, affixed on the Chinese Travel Document.\n** Residents of [[Special administrative regions of China]] wishing to visit Mainland China and do not have a [[Home Return Permit]];\n** Chinese nationals who have lost their Chinese passports, HKSAR passports or MSAR passports while abroad.\n\n===Exit-Entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macau===\n{{main|Exit-Entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macau}}\nThe Exit-Entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macau, also known as the Two-way Permit, is issued to Chinese nationals with hukou who only wish to visit Hong Kong and Macau.\n\n===Permit for Proceeding to Hong Kong and Macao===\n{{main|People's Republic of China Permit for Proceeding to Hong Kong and Macao}}\nThe Permit for Proceeding to Hong Kong and Macao, also known as the One-way Permit, is issued to Chinese nationals who are settling in Hong Kong or Macau and have relinquished their Chinese residency (hukou). After their initial entry to Hong Kong or Macau, they are considered as SAR residents and are permanently ineligible for an ordinary Chinese passport, and later they will be eligible for SAR passports if they acquire a permanent resident status in the respective SARs.\n\n===Travel Permit to and from Taiwan===\nThe '''Travel Permit to and from Taiwan''', colloquially known as Mainland Compatriot Permit or Mainland Resident Travel Permit, is issued to Chinese nationals with [[hukou]] in [[Mainland China]] by [[Ministry of Public Security (China)|Ministry of Public Security]], to those who wish to travel directly between Mainland China and [[Taiwan]]. Holders of the permit are required to obtain exit endorsements issued by MPS and [[Exit & Entry Permit (Republic of China)|Exit and Entry Permit]] issued by Taiwanese authorities prior to travelling.\n\n==Self-Service Immigration System (e-Channel)==\nHolders of Chinese biometric Passports are eligible to use the Self-Service Immigration System, or e-Channel. E-Channel are located throughout numerous international airports in Mainland China (including these top 10 busiest international gateways: [[Beijing Capital International Airport]], [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport]], [[Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport]], [[Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport]] and [[Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport]]) as well as land border crossing checkpoints in [[Shenzhen]] and [[Zhuhai]]. e-Channel was first introduced for self-entry, i.e. for Chinese biometric passport holders return to China from Outside destinations. In order to use the e-Channel, they must hold biometric passports with their fingerprint data pre-recorded on the biometric chip. If their biometric passports do not contain fingerprint data, they must first register with [[China Immigration Inspection]] (CII) at land border checkpoints or international airports to be eligible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcia.com.cn/news/news/140825/news1035.shtml|date=November 23, 2012|accessdate=July 2, 2015|title=\u7ec6\u8bf4\u9996\u90fd\u673a\u573a\u8fb9\u9632\u81ea\u52a9\u901a\u5173|publisher=BCIA|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704104920/http://www.bcia.com.cn/news/news/140825/news1035.shtml|archive-date=July 4, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nStarting from August 19, 2016, passengers are able to use the e-Gates in terminal 2 of Beijing Capital International Airport to complete exit procedures from China as well.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/politics/2016-08/20/c_129243603.htm|title=\u9996\u90fd\u673a\u573a\u81ea\u52a9\u901a\u5173\u51fa\u5883 \u6700\u5feb6\u79d2-\u65b0\u534e\u7f51|website=news.xinhuanet.com|access-date=2016-09-06}}</ref>\n\nStarting from Dec 1, 2017, Shanghai international airports including PVG and SHA both have e-Channel for exit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.163.com/17/1201/13/D4IS59OV00018AOQ.html|title=\u4e0a\u6d77\u542f\u752826\u6761\u51fa\u5883\u8fb9\u68c0\u81ea\u52a9\u901a\u5173\u901a\u9053|last=\u7f51\u6613|website=news.163.com|access-date=2017-12-02}}</ref>\n\n===Eligibility===\nThe extended list of eligible travellers is:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://xw.kunming.cn/a/2016-08/20/content_4339106.htm|title=\u8fb9\u68c0\u6269\u5927\u81ea\u52a9\u901a\u5173\u4eba\u5458\u8303\u56f4 10\u7c7b\u65c5\u5ba2\u4ece\u6606\u660e\u51fa\u5165\u58835\u79d2\u53ef\u901a\u5173|website=\u6606\u660e\u4fe1\u606f\u6e2f|access-date=2016-09-06}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nRegistration with CII not required:\n* Holders of biometric passports that contain fingerprint data;\n* Holders of the new biometric [[Two-way Permit]]s with valid entry endorsements that contain fingerprint data.\n\nRegistration with CII required:\n* Holders of the booklet-style Two-way Permits with multiple-entry endorsements;\n* Holders of Travel Permit to and from Taiwan for Mainland Residents booklet with multiple-exit endorsements;\n* Holders of Exit and Entry Permits that are valid for one year and multiple entries (only for the specific port of entry that they have registered with);\n* Holders of [[Home Return Permit]]s;\n* Holders of [[Taiwan Compatriot Permit]]s;\n* Foreign nationals with their passports and Chinese Permanent Resident cards;\n* Foreign nationals with their biometric passports and residence permits with a validity of more than 6 months; and\n* Flight crew members serving scheduled flights who are either Chinese or visa-exempt nationals, or non-visa-exempt nationals holding crew or work visas or residence permits that are valid for at least 1 year.\n\n==Visa requirements==\n{{Main|Visa requirements for Chinese citizens}}\n[[File:Visa requirements for Chinese citizens holding ordinary and ordinary passports for public affairs and Two-way and Exit & Entry permits.png|alt=|thumb|816x816px|Visa-free travel for PRC citizens holding ordinary or public affairs passports]]\nVisa requirements for Chinese citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of the People's Republic of China.

It was commissioned following the success of ''[[I Love the '70s (British TV series)|I Love the '70s]]'' and is part of the [[I Love...]] series. ''I Love 1980'' premiered on [[BBC Two]] on 13 January 2001 and the last, ''I Love 1989'', on 24 March 2001. Unlike with ''I Love the '70s'', episodes were increased to 90 minutes long. The series was followed later in 2001 by ''[[I Love the '90s (British TV series)|I Love the '90s]]''.  The success of the series led to [[VH1]] remaking the show for the US market: [[I Love the '80s (American TV series)|I Love the '80s USA]], which is known simply as \"I Love the '80s\" in the US itself. The following  repeat version in 2001 was cut down to an hour per year, then in 2019, the series was repeated again, this time cut down into a 30 minutes per year \"highlights\" version removing certain pop-culture and/or contributors.\n\n==Contributors==\nThe series used many regular contributors, which included [[Peter Kay]], [[Clare Grogan]], [[Dee Hepburn]], [[Kate Thornton]], [[Stuart Maconie]], [[Emma B]], [[Ice-T]], [[Toyah Willcox]], [[Tommy Vance]], [[Tara Palmer-Tomkinson]], [[Ross Noble]] and many others.\n\n==Episode guide==\n\n===''I Love 1980'' broadcast: 13 January 2001===\nPresented by [[Larry Hagman]].

{"title_page": "Railroad car", "text_new": "{{train topics}}\n\nA '''railroad car''' or '''railcar''' ([[American English|American]] and [[Canadian English]]),{{efn|name=US usage}} '''railway wagon''', '''trucks''', or '''railway carriage''' ([[British English]]  and [[International Union of Railways|UIC]]), also called a '''train car''' or '''train wagon''', is a [[vehicle]] used for the carrying of [[cargo]] or [[passenger]]s on a [[rail transport|rail transport system]] (a railroad/railway). Such cars, when coupled together and hauled by one or more [[locomotive]]s, form a [[train]]. Alternatively, some [[Passenger car (rail)|passenger cars]] are self-propelled in which case they may be either single [[railcar]]s or make up [[multiple unit]]s.\n\nThe term \"'''car'''\" is commonly used by itself in American English when a rail context is implicit. [[Indian English]] sometimes uses \"'''bogie'''\" in the same manner,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordadvancedlearnersdictionary.com/dictionary/bogie|title=Oxford Learner's Dictionaries - Find definitions, translations, and grammar explanations at Oxford Learner's Dictionaries|website=www.oxfordadvancedlearnersdictionary.com|accessdate=5 May 2018|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807101435/http://www.oxfordadvancedlearnersdictionary.com/dictionary/bogie|archivedate=2011-08-07}}</ref> though the term has [[bogie|other meanings]] in other variants of English. In American English, \"railcar\" is a generic term for a railway vehicle; in other countries \"[[railcar]]\" refers specifically to a self-propelled, powered, railway vehicle.\n\nAlthough some cars exist for the railroad's own use \u2013 for [[Track (rail transport)#Track maintenance|track maintenance]] purposes, for example \u2013 most carry a revenue-earning load of passengers or freight, and may be classified accordingly as [[passenger car (rail)|passenger car]]s or [[Coach (rail)|coaches]] on the one hand or [[freight car]]s (or ''wagons'') on the other.\n\n== Passenger cars ==\n{{main|Passenger car (rail)}}\n\n[[Passenger car (rail)|Passenger car]]s, or [[Coach (rail)|coaches]], vary in their internal fittings:\n\nIn [[standard-gauge]] cars, seating is usually configured into ranges of between three and five seats across the width of the car, with an aisle in between (resulting in arrangements of 2+1, 2+2 or 3+2 seats) or at the side. Tables may be provided between seats facing one another. Alternatively, seats facing in the same direction may have access to a fold-down ledge on the back of the seat in front.\n\n* If the aisle is located between seats, seat rows may face the same direction, or be grouped, with twin rows facing each other.\n* In some vehicles intended for commuter services, seats are positioned with their backs to the side walls, either on one side or more commonly on both, facing each other across the aisle. This gives a wide accessway and allows room for [[standing passenger]]s at peak times, as well as improving loading and unloading speeds.\n* If the aisle is at the side, the car is usually divided into small compartments. These usually contain six seats, although sometimes in second class they contain eight, and sometimes in first class they contain four.\n\nPassenger cars can take the electricity supply for heating and lighting equipment from either of two main sources: directly from a [[head end power]] generator on the [[locomotive]] via bus cables, or by an axle-powered generator which continuously charges batteries whenever the train is in motion.\n\nModern cars usually have either [[air-conditioning]] or windows that can be opened (sometimes, for safety, not so far that one can hang out), or sometimes both. Various types of [[Passenger train toilets|onboard train toilet]] facilities may also be provided.\n\nOther types of passenger car exist, especially for long journeys, such as the [[dining car]], [[parlor car]], [[disco]] car, and in rare cases [[theater]] and [[movie theater]] car. In some cases another type of car is temporarily converted to one of these for an event.\n\n[[Observation car]]s were built for the rear of many famous trains to allow the passengers to view the scenery. These proved popular, leading to the development of [[dome car]]s multiple units of which could be placed mid-train, and featured a glass-enclosed upper level extending above the normal roof to provide passengers with a better view.\n\n[[Sleeping car]]s outfitted with (generally) small bedrooms allow passengers to sleep through their night-time trips, while [[couchette car]]s provide more basic sleeping accommodation.  Long-distance trains often require [[baggage car]]s for the passengers' luggage. In European practice it used to be common for day coaches to be formed of compartments seating 6 or 8 passengers, with access from a side corridor. In the UK, Corridor coaches fell into disfavor in the 1960s and 1970s partially because open coaches are considered more secure by women traveling alone.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nAnother distinction is between single- and double deck [[bilevel rail car|train]] cars. An example of a [[Bilevel car|double decker]] is the [[Superliner (railcar)|Amtrak superliner]].\n\nA \"trainset\" (or \"set\") is a semi-permanently arranged formation of cars, rather than one created \"ad hoc\" out of whatever cars are available. These are only broken up and reshuffled 'on shed' (in the maintenance depot). Trains are then built of one or more of these 'sets' coupled together as needed for the capacity of that train.\n\nOften, but not always, passenger cars in a train are linked together with enclosed, flexible [[gangway connection]]s through which passengers and crewmen can walk. Some designs incorporate semi-permanent connections between cars and may have a full-width connection, effectively making them one long, articulated 'car'. In North America, passenger cars also employ [[tightlock coupling]]s to keep a train together in the event of a derailment or other accident.\n\nMany [[multiple unit]] trains consist of cars which are semi-permanently coupled into sets: these sets may be joined together to form larger trains, but generally passengers can only move around between cars within a set.  This \"closed\" arrangement keeps parties of travellers and their luggage together, and hence allows the separate sets to be easily split to go separate ways.  Some multiple-unit trainsets are designed so that corridor connections can be easily opened between coupled sets; this generally requires driving cabs either set to the side or (as in the Dutch ''[[NS Intercity Materieel|Koploper]]'' or the Japanese [[285 series]]) above the passenger compartment. These cabs or [[driving trailers]] are also useful for quickly reversing the train.\n\n=== Passenger car gallery ===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" class=\"center\">\nFile:Amersham station MMB 18 S Stock.jpg|A [[Metropolitan line]] [[London Underground S7 and S8 Stock|S8 Stock]] at [[Amersham]] in [[London]].\nFile:Bombardier S Stock Circle line Interior 1.jpg|A interior of a [[London Underground S7 and S8 Stock|S7 Stock]] in [[London]]. \nFile:Mark3gner.jpg|[[British Rail Mark 3]] coach, an all-steel car from the 1970s\nFile:InterCity2 - passenger car interior.jpg|Inside a modern-day car from Finland\nFile:150243 C Bristol Temple Meads.JPG|A [[British Rail Class 150]] in the [[United Kingdom]].\n</gallery>\n\n=== Passenger car gallery in China,Taiwan,Hong Kong and Japan===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" class=\"center\">\nFile:YW25T 677028 20111004.jpg|A China Railway model 25T hard sleeper car in [[Beijing West railway station]] in [[China]].\nFile:201702 Interior of RZ25T-111134.jpg|The interior of a China Railway model 25T soft seat car.\nFile:HK MTR East Rail SP1900.jpg|A [[SP1900 EMU|SP1950 EMU]] train in [[Sha Tin station]] in [[Hong Kong]].\nFile:MTR ERL SP1900 (8).JPG|The interior of a [[SP1900 EMU|SP1950 EMU]] train.\nFile:TRA EMU100 55EM101.jpg|A [[Taiwan Railway EMU100 series]] train in [[Shulin railway station]] in [[Taiwan]].\nFile:TRA EMU100 ET102 inside.jpg|The interior of a [[Taiwan Railway EMU100 series]] train.\nFile:JRW T683-4801.jpg|A [[683 series]] train in [[Japan]].\nFile:JRW series683-2000 ordinarycar-inside-2.JPG|The interior of a [[683 series]] train.\nFile:JRK-800 U006 826-106.jpg|A [[800 Series Shinkansen]] train in [[Japan]].\nFile:Kyushu Railway - Series 800-0 - Cabin - 02.JPG|The interior of an [[800 Series Shinkansen]] train.\nFile:TEMB2076.jpg|A Taiwan Railway TEMU2000 series train.\n</gallery>\n\n=== Types of freight cars ===\nFreight cars (US), [[goods wagon]]s (UIC), or trucks (UK) exist in a wide variety of types, adapted to carry a host of goods.

Maintaining a missile on a train is more difficult than in a silo, while rail lines and roads can be blocked by snow, which tends to restrict railroad ICBMs to warmer climates.

Such cars, when coupled together and hauled by one or more [[locomotive]]s, form a [[train]]. Alternatively, some [[Passenger car (rail)|passenger cars]] are self-propelled in which case they may be either single [[railcar]]s or make up [[multiple unit]]s.\n\nThe term \"'''car'''\" is commonly used by itself in American English when a rail context is implicit. [[Indian English]] sometimes uses \"'''bogie'''\" in the same manner,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordadvancedlearnersdictionary.com/dictionary/bogie|title=Oxford Learner's Dictionaries - Find definitions, translations, and grammar explanations at Oxford Learner's Dictionaries|website=www.oxfordadvancedlearnersdictionary.com|accessdate=5 May 2018|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807101435/http://www.oxfordadvancedlearnersdictionary.com/dictionary/bogie|archivedate=2011-08-07}}</ref> though the term has [[bogie|other meanings]] in other variants of English. In American English, \"railcar\" is a generic term for a railway vehicle; in other countries \"[[railcar]]\" refers specifically to a self-propelled, powered, railway vehicle.\n\nAlthough some cars exist for the railroad's own use \u2013 for [[Track (rail transport)#Track maintenance|track maintenance]] purposes, for example \u2013 most carry a revenue-earning load of passengers or freight, and may be classified accordingly as [[passenger car (rail)|passenger car]]s or [[Coach (rail)|coaches]] on the one hand or [[freight car]]s (or ''wagons'') on the other.\n\n== Passenger cars ==\n{{main|Passenger car (rail)}}\n\n[[Passenger car (rail)|Passenger car]]s, or [[Coach (rail)|coaches]], vary in their internal fittings:\n\nIn [[standard-gauge]] cars, seating is usually configured into ranges of between three and five seats across the width of the car, with an aisle in between (resulting in arrangements of 2+1, 2+2 or 3+2 seats) or at the side. Tables may be provided between seats facing one another. Alternatively, seats facing in the same direction may have access to a fold-down ledge on the back of the seat in front.\n\n* If the aisle is located between seats, seat rows may face the same direction, or be grouped, with twin rows facing each other.\n* In some vehicles intended for commuter services, seats are positioned with their backs to the side walls, either on one side or more commonly on both, facing each other across the aisle. This gives a wide accessway and allows room for [[standing passenger]]s at peak times, as well as improving loading and unloading speeds.\n* If the aisle is at the side, the car is usually divided into small compartments. These usually contain six seats, although sometimes in second class they contain eight, and sometimes in first class they contain four.\n\nPassenger cars can take the electricity supply for heating and lighting equipment from either of two main sources: directly from a [[head end power]] generator on the [[locomotive]] via bus cables, or by an axle-powered generator which continuously charges batteries whenever the train is in motion.\n\nModern cars usually have either [[air-conditioning]] or windows that can be opened (sometimes, for safety, not so far that one can hang out), or sometimes both. Various types of [[Passenger train toilets|onboard train toilet]] facilities may also be provided.\n\nOther types of passenger car exist, especially for long journeys, such as the [[dining car]], [[parlor car]], [[disco]] car, and in rare cases [[theater]] and [[movie theater]] car. In some cases another type of car is temporarily converted to one of these for an event.\n\n[[Observation car]]s were built for the rear of many famous trains to allow the passengers to view the scenery. These proved popular, leading to the development of [[dome car]]s multiple units of which could be placed mid-train, and featured a glass-enclosed upper level extending above the normal roof to provide passengers with a better view.\n\n[[Sleeping car]]s outfitted with (generally) small bedrooms allow passengers to sleep through their night-time trips, while [[couchette car]]s provide more basic sleeping accommodation.  Long-distance trains often require [[baggage car]]s for the passengers' luggage. In European practice it used to be common for day coaches to be formed of compartments seating 6 or 8 passengers, with access from a side corridor. In the UK, Corridor coaches fell into disfavor in the 1960s and 1970s partially because open coaches are considered more secure by women traveling alone.{{fact|date=July 2018}}\n\nAnother distinction is between single- and double deck [[bilevel rail car|train]] cars. An example of a [[Bilevel car|double decker]] is the [[Superliner (railcar)|Amtrak superliner]].\n\nA \"trainset\" (or \"set\") is a semi-permanently arranged formation of cars, rather than one created \"ad hoc\" out of whatever cars are available. These are only broken up and reshuffled 'on shed' (in the maintenance depot). Trains are then built of one or more of these 'sets' coupled together as needed for the capacity of that train.\n\nOften, but not always, passenger cars in a train are linked together with enclosed, flexible [[gangway connection]]s through which passengers and crewmen can walk. Some designs incorporate semi-permanent connections between cars and may have a full-width connection, effectively making them one long, articulated 'car'. In North America, passenger cars also employ [[tightlock coupling]]s to keep a train together in the event of a derailment or other accident.\n\nMany [[multiple unit]] trains consist of cars which are semi-permanently coupled into sets: these sets may be joined together to form larger trains, but generally passengers can only move around between cars within a set.  This \"closed\" arrangement keeps parties of travellers and their luggage together, and hence allows the separate sets to be easily split to go separate ways.  Some multiple-unit trainsets are designed so that corridor connections can be easily opened between coupled sets; this generally requires driving cabs either set to the side or (as in the Dutch ''[[NS Intercity Materieel|Koploper]]'' or the Japanese [[285 series]]) above the passenger compartment. These cabs or [[driving trailers]] are also useful for quickly reversing the train.\n=== Passenger car gallery ===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" class=\"center\">\nFile:Amersham station MMB 18 S Stock.jpg|A [[Metropolitan line]] [[London Underground S7 and S8 Stock|S8 Stock]] at [[Amersham]] in [[London]].\nFile:Bombardier S Stock Circle line Interior 1.jpg|A interior of a [[London Underground S7 and S8 Stock|S7 Stock]] in [[London]]. \nFile:Mark3gner.jpg|[[British Rail Mark 3]] coach, an all-steel car from the 1970s\nFile:InterCity2 - passenger car interior.jpg|Inside a modern-day car from Finland\nFile:150243 C Bristol Temple Meads.JPG|A [[British Rail Class 150]] in the [[United Kingdom]].\n</gallery>\n\n=== Passenger car gallery in China,Taiwan,Hong Kong and Japan===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" class=\"center\">\nFile:YW25T 677028 20111004.jpg|A China Railway model 25T hard sleeper car in [[Beijing West railway station]] in [[China]].\nFile:201702 Interior of RZ25T-111134.jpg|The interior of a China Railway model 25T soft seat car.\nFile:HK MTR East Rail SP1900.jpg|A [[SP1900 EMU|SP1950 EMU]] train in [[Sha Tin station]] in [[Hong Kong]].\nFile:MTR ERL SP1900 (8).JPG|The interior of a [[SP1900 EMU|SP1950 EMU]] train.\nFile:TRA EMU100 55EM101.jpg|A [[Taiwan Railway EMU100 series]] train in [[Shulin railway station]] in [[Taiwan]].\nFile:TRA EMU100 ET102 inside.jpg|The interior of a [[Taiwan Railway EMU100 series]] train.\nFile:JRW T683-4801.jpg|A [[683 series]] train in [[Japan]].\nFile:JRW series683-2000 ordinarycar-inside-2.JPG|The interior of a [[683 series]] train.\nFile:JRK-800 U006 826-106.jpg|A [[800 Series Shinkansen]] train in [[Japan]].\nFile:Kyushu Railway - Series 800-0 - Cabin - 02.JPG|The interior of a [[800 Series Shinkansen]] train.\nFile:TEMB2076.jpg|A Taiwan Railway TEMU2000 series train.\n</gallery>\n\n=== Types of freight cars ===\nFreight cars (US), [[goods wagon]]s (UIC), or trucks (UK) exist in a wide variety of types, adapted to carry a host of goods.

Maintaining a missile on a train is more difficult than in a silo, while rail lines and roads can be blocked by snow, which tends to restrict railroad ICBMs to warmer climates. In addition, because there are only a limited number of rail lines and highways in an area, enemy surveillance can focus on a few areas. And, once located, mobile missiles are more vulnerable than ICBMs in hardened silos.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nationalinterest.org/blog/russias-nuclear-missile-death-train-arriving-2019-19581|title=Russia's Nuclear Missile 'Death Train' Arriving in 2019|first=Michael|last=Peck|website=The National Interest|accessdate=5 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321165952/http://nationalinterest.org/blog/russias-nuclear-missile-death-train-arriving-2019-19581|archivedate=21 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Air brake (rail)|Air brake]]\n* [[Great Western Railway wagons]]\n* [[List of railway vehicles]]\n* [[List of rolling stock manufacturers]]\n* [[RailRider|Rail car tracking device]]\n* [[Railway brake]]s\n* [[Rolling stock]]\n* [[Tamping machine]]\n* [[Tender (rail)|Tender]]\n* [[Tram]]\n* [[Goods wagon#Types of goods wagon|Types of goods wagon]]\n* [[UIC classification of goods wagons]]\n* [[Vacuum brake]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n{{notes\n| notes =\n\n{{efn\n| name = US usage\n| In the US, a \"railroad car\" is often referred to more simply as a \"rail car\" or \"railcar\", but this should not be confused with the self-propelled [[railcar]].\n}}\n\n}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Further reading ===\n* {{cite book| title=The Railroad Car Builder's Dictionary| url=https://archive.org/details/railroadcarbuild00forn| url-access=registration| author=Matthias N.
