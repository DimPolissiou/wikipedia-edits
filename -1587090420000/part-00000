Changing his mind at the last minute, he recalls his days in elementary school and the events that have led him here. A new student named Shoko Nishimiya informs the class that she is deaf. She tries to integrate with the class but ends up annoying Shoya and his friends, so they start to bully her. When word of the bullying reaches the principal, Shoya is singled out as the culprit. Soon, the class's bullying is directed toward him, subjecting him to the same treatment he gave Shoko. Shoya blames Shoko, and the two get into a physical altercation. She is subsequently transferred to another school. He later finds Shoko's notebook, which she left behind, and keeps it.\n\nNow in high school, Shoya is a social reject. He blocks out the faces of those around him, unable to look them in the eye. Tomohiro Nagatsuka, another loner, befriends Shoya after Shoya helps him with a bully. Shoya visits the [[sign language]] center, returns Shoko's notebook to her in the hopes of making amends and reveals he has learned [[Japanese Sign Language|sign language]]. The two begin meeting at a bridge to feed bread to Koi fish.\n\nOne day, Shoya and Shoko accidentally drop Shoko's notebook into a river, and they jump in to retrieve it, which is prohibited. Yuzuru Nishimiya, Shoko's younger sister, secretly takes a photo of Shoya jumping in and posts it online. Shoya is suspended.\n\nShoya finds Yuzuru, who ran away from home, and brings her to stay at his house. When she leaves in the middle of the night, Shoya follows and tells her that he is remorseful for the way he treated Shoko; she decides to go home. The sisters' mother, Yaeko Nishimiya, slaps Shoya in the face before bringing Yuzuru inside.\n\nShoya and Shoko reunite with Miyoko Sahara, a classmate from elementary school who was friendly to Shoko. Shoko gives Shoya a gift and confesses her feelings for him, but because she tries to speak her affections rather than signing them out, Shoya does not understand her.\n\nShoya invites her to an amusement park with Tomohiro, Miyoko, Miki Kawai (another classmate from elementary school) and Satoshi Mashiba (Miki's friend). There, they meet another classmate from elementary school, Naoka Ueno, who drags Shoko into a ferris wheel. Naoka voices her feelings of hatred for Shoko, whom Naoka blames for creating a rift between her and Shoya. At school, desperate to remain blameless for her part in bullying Shoko, Miki exposes Shoya's past to the students who were oblivious to it. Later, the group has a heated confrontation.\n\nShoya goes back to the bridge to meet Shoko but ends up seeing Yuzuru, whose grandmother had just died recently. To cheer Shoko up, Shoya takes her to the countryside, where he begins to understand how much she blames herself for everything that has happened to him. Desperate to change her mindset, Shoya contrives to regularly meet with the sisters.\n\nDuring the [[Fireworks#Japan|fireworks festival]], Shoko goes home under the guise of finishing some schoolwork. Shoya follows when Yuzuru asks him to get her camera. When he arrives, he finds Shoko standing on the balcony, about to commit suicide. Shoya succeeds in grabbing her and pulls her back up, but he falls into the river below. He is rescued but slips into a coma.\n\nOne night, Shoko dreams about receiving a farewell visit from Shoya. Horrified, she runs to the bridge and collapses in tears. Shoya, awakening from his coma, stumbles to the bridge and finds her there. He apologizes for the way he treated her. He asks her to stop blaming herself and admits that, while he once considered ending his own life, he has since decided against it.

Please check the word count before making any additions. Please go to the talk page before making any major changes. -->\nJapanese teenager Shoya Ishida intends to commit suicide. Changing his mind at the last minute, he recalls his days in elementary school and the events that have led him here. A new student named Shoko Nishimiya informs the class that she is deaf. She tries to integrate with the class but ends up annoying Shoya and his friends, so they start to bully her. When word of the bullying reaches the principal, Shoya is singled out as the culprit. Soon, the class's bullying is directed toward him, subjecting him to the same treatment he gave Shoko. Shoya blames Shoko, and the two get into a physical altercation. She is subsequently transferred to another school. He later finds Shoko's notebook, which she left behind, and keeps it.\n\nNow in high school, Shoya is a social reject. He blocks out the faces of those around him, unable to look them in the eye. Tomohiro Nagatsuka, another loner, befriends Shoya after Shoya helps him with a bully. Shoya visits the [[sign language]] center, returns Shoko's notebook to her in the hopes of making amends and reveals he has learned [[Japanese Sign Language|sign language]]. The two begin meeting at a bridge to feed bread to Koi fish.\n\nOne day, Shoya and Shoko accidentally drop Shoko's notebook into a river, and they jump in to retrieve it, which is prohibited. Yuzuru Nishimiya, Shoko's younger sister, secretly takes a photo of Shoya jumping in and posts it online. Shoya is suspended.\n\nShoya finds Yuzuru, who ran away from home, and brings her to stay at his house. When she leaves in the middle of the night, Shoya follows and tells her that he is remorseful for the way he treated Shoko; she decides to go home. The sisters' mother, Yaeko Nishimiya, slaps Shoya in the face before bringing Yuzuru inside.\n\nShoya and Shoko reunite with Miyoko Sahara, a classmate from elementary school who was friendly to Shoko. Shoko gives Shoya a gift and confesses her feelings for him, but because she tries to speak her affections rather than signing them out, Shoya does not understand her.\n\nShoya invites her to an amusement park with Tomohiro, Miyoko, Miki Kawai (another classmate from elementary school) and Satoshi Mashiba (Miki's friend). There, they meet another classmate from elementary school, Naoka Ueno, who drags Shoko into a ferris wheel. Naoka voices her feelings of hatred for Shoko, whom Naoka blames for creating a rift between her and Shoya. At school, desperate to remain blameless for her part in bullying Shoko, Miki exposes Shoya's past to the students who were oblivious to it. Later, the group has a heated confrontation.\n\nShoya goes back to the bridge to meet Shoko but ends up seeing Yuzuru, whose grandmother had just died recently. To cheer Shoko up, Shoya takes her to the countryside, where he begins to understand how much she blames herself for everything that has happened to him. Desperate to change her mindset, Shoya contrives to regularly meet with the sisters.\n\nDuring the [[Fireworks#Japan|fireworks festival]], Shoko goes home under the guise of finishing some schoolwork. Shoya follows when Yuzuru asks him to get her camera. When he arrives, he finds Shoko standing on the balcony, about to commit suicide. Shoya succeeds in grabbing her and pulls her back up, but he falls into the river below. He is rescued but slips into a coma.\n\nOne night, Shoko dreams about receiving a farewell visit from Shoya. Horrified, she runs to the bridge and collapses in tears. Shoya, awakening from his coma, stumbles to the bridge and finds her there. He apologizes for the way he treated her. He asks her to stop blaming herself and admits that, while he once considered ending his own life, he has since decided against it. Shoya then asks her to help him continue to live.\n\nWhen Shoya goes to the [[Cultural festival (Japan)|school festival]] with Shoko, he finds out how much his new friends still care for him, and they reconcile. During the festival, Shoya is finally able to look at other people's faces again and looks around at his family and all the new friends he has made. He cries, realizing he has finally obtained redemption and has found forgiveness at last.\n\n==Voice cast==\n;{{nihongo|Shoya Ishida|\u77f3\u7530 \u5c06\u4e5f|Ishida Sh\u014dya}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Miyu Irino]],<ref name=\"VAPart1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-05-27/a-silent-voice-anime-film-stars-miyu-irino-saori-hayami/.102548|title=A Silent Voice Anime Film Stars Miyu Irino, Saori Hayami|date=May 27, 2016|website=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=May 27, 2016}}</ref> [[Mayu Matsuoka]] (child)<ref name=\"VAPart2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-07-08/a-silent-voice-anime-film-reveals-trailer-more-cast-new-visual/.104076|title=A Silent Voice Anime Film Reveals Trailer, More Cast, New Visual|date=July 8, 2016|website=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=July 8, 2016}}</ref>|[[Robbie Daymond]],<ref name=\"English Cast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.blog.alltheanime.com/a-silent-voice-uk-home-video-release-details/|title='A Silent Voice' UK Home Video Details|date=September 26, 2017|publisher=All The Anime|accessdate=September 26, 2017}}</ref> Ryan Shanahan (child)}}\n:A high school boy who bullied Shoko Nishimiya, a deaf girl, in elementary school.
