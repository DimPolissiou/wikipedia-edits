He is one of the most powerful beings in the [[DC Universe]], along with [[Darkseid]], [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]], [[Barbatos (comics)|Barbatos]], [[Hades (DC Comics)|Hades]], the [[Anti-Monitor]], [[Nekron]], and the [[Great Evil Beast]], having enslaved many worlds. He is the [[archenemy]] of the [[Teen Titans]], father of the superhero [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]], and husband of [[Arella]].\n\n[[Seamus Dever]] portrayed the disguised human version of Trigon in the ''[[Titans (2018 TV series)|Titans]]'' television series, a [[DC Universe]] streaming service exclusive. His real form was revealed as a red demon with horns and four eyes and he does not have bat-like wings and/or a tail.\n\n==Publication history==\nTrigon first appeared in a cameo in ''[[Teen Titans|New Teen Titans]]'' #2 (December 1980) and his first full appearance is ''New Teen Titans'' #4.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=313}}</ref> He was created by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[George P\u00e9rez]].<ref>''The New Teen Titans'' #2</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nA sadistic, cruel, dangerous, and powerful demon of inter-dimensional origin, Trigon is a result of the mating between a female member of a mystic sect and the god they worshipped. A side effect of this pairing is that their child was filled with the cast-off evil energies of the inhabitants of [[Azarath]], forming him into their personification. At birth, Trigon killed everyone around him (including his own mother), at the age of one, he ruled an entire planet, at the age of six, he destroyed an entire planet, and by the age of 30, he held dominion over millions of worlds in his dimension.<ref>''New Teen Titans #6''. DC Comics.</ref> There is some confusion regarding the origins of Trigon, as he claims to have existed as formless energy since the beginning of his own universe, while the energies cast off by Azar and Azarath simply allowed him to take physical form roughly a thousand years before DC's present day.\n\n[[Arella]] was a depressed woman who decided to join a cult known as the [[Church of Blood]] that was trying to kill Trigon. When the ritual was performed, Trigon, disguised as a handsome male, emerged and married Arella. After making love, Arella discovered Trigon's true nature after seeing his true form. Trigon sends Arella back to Earth, and Arella is pregnant and on the brink of suicide when she is found by an extra-dimensional cult and is brought to Azarath, where she gives birth to their daughter [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]]. Raven is brought up to \"control her emotions\" in order to suppress and control the demonic powers she inherited from Trigon.<ref>''New Teen Titans'' #6. DC Comics.</ref> During this time, Trigon was aware of his daughter's whereabouts, but rarely intervened, except when a renegade monk named Juris attempted to cast Raven as an infant into another dimension to avert her potential threat; Trigon struck him down at the moment of the deed, and allowed the cult to keep her safe at present.\n\nRaven learned of Trigon's intentions to conquer the Earth and vowed to stop him; she initially approached the [[Justice League]], but they refused her on the advice of [[Zatanna]], who sensed her demonic parentage. In desperation, she reformed the [[Teen Titans]] with several new members in order to fight her father. The team was eventually able to defeat Trigon and seal him in an interdimensional prison. However, Raven still had to fight her father's influence as he was not completely destroyed. \n\nTrigon eventually escaped and came to Earth, taking control of Raven and destroying Azarath in the process. The Titans came together and tried to fight Trigon, but were contaminated by his demonic influence and killed Raven; this allowed the souls of Azarath to possess her and use her as a channel to kill Trigon\u2014the demonic possession had been part of a plan to defeat Trigon, as the Titans would never have killed Raven on their own\u2014blasting him out of existence with a beam of purifying light. Although Trigon is gone, his followers (led by [[Brother Blood]]) have tried to revive him several times.<ref>''Teen Titans'' #8. DC Comics.</ref><ref>''Teen Titans'' #10. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n===The Sons of Trigon===\n[[File:Raven-brothers.PNG|thumb|right|Three of Trigon's sons. Left to right: Jesse, Jared, and Jacob.

DC Comics.</ref>\n\nThree of Trigon's sons, '''Jacob''', '''Jared''' and '''Jesse''', play a significant role in his return to life. The brothers have the ability to induce the seven deadly sins in any living being; they can induce wrath (Jared), lust (Jacob) and envy (Jesse).<ref name=T4>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #4. DC Comics.</ref> They attempt to open the portal to Trigon's realm, but they betray Trigon and steal what little power he had; this actually makes Trigon proud of them.<ref name=T4 /> The trio leave, thinking they have gained great power, and Trigon is left trapped in his realm.<ref name=T4 /> However, the three brothers return, corrupting their half-sister, making her their ally.<ref name= T5>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #5. DC Comics.</ref> Eventually, they are defeated by Raven and the Titans.<ref name= T5 />\n\n===''The New 52''===\nIn September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Trigon makes his post-''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' debut in issue #1 of the ''[[Phantom Stranger]]''.<ref>''Phantom Stranger'' #1. DC Comics.</ref> In this incarnation, Trigon has an extra set of eyes, giving him six in total. He has struck a bargain with the Stranger to return his offspring Raven/Rachel Roth to him, in turn to spare Earth from his armies that were ready to search the Earth for her, having already destroyed Azarath years ago. In ''The New 52'', it has been revealed that Trigon has at least four children, where Raven is the youngest, her older brothers are named Belial, Ruskoff, and Suge; Belial is the oldest and most civilized, according to himself, of the three brothers.<ref>''Phantom Stranger'' #2. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nLater, Trigon returns to Earth, feeling confident in having swayed Raven to his side during their time together in the Under-Realms where time flows differently. It has been revealed that Trigon is the ruler of six kingdoms known as the Under-Realms, a collective title for the planets and dimensions under his rule and that he has grown bored with them. At first he ruled through his own power, then through conquest on the battlefield and finally through subterfuge. His ultimate goal is to unite all seven realms under the rule of Raven, whom he believes will mold them all in her own image, something only she can do as she has the capacity to love, something Trigon cannot do.\n\nAs part of [[Forever Evil|DC Villains Month]], Trigon replaced the Teen Titans as the main characters in their book for one issue named #23.1 with [[Deathstroke]] taking over #23.2. The Teen Titans book resumed publishing after Villains Month concluded. Though unconfirmed, the Villains Month event leaves Trigon's origins in question. Long ago, in another universe, a trinity of beings called the Divine attempted to eradicate the concept of evil through an item known as the Heart of Darkness. When the Divine return to a world they believed liberated, they find it in utter chaos along with the being they believe to be responsible, only because he appears not to be one of the planet's inhabitants. As they had done billions of times before, they sentence him and his two guards to the Heart of Darkness, that would feed on their evils. However, they were horrified when the stranger not only resisted but consumed the Heart of Darkness, along with the evils of a billion worlds, which heralded the true birth of Trigon. Now driven by an insatiable hunger for evil, Trigon moves slowly from universe to universe, spreading his devastating brand of evil in order to sate a hunger that knows no end.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #23.1-23.2. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nMuch later, Trigon encounters a woman wearing a suit of armor specifically crafted to counter his immense powers. Though neither is able to slay the other, Trigon is forced to retreat, swearing that members of his blood would return in their thousands to destroy the wearer of the Silent Armor. Trigon has since set his plans into action, only to run into the problem of most of the mothers of his children being unable to endure it, leaving Trigon with only three sons, all of whom he considers failures. Then, one day, he is brought a human from Earth known as Arella, who gives him his first daughter; Raven, the most powerful of Trigon's children, and the reason why Trigon now targets Earth for conquest.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nTrigon is pure evil and a powerful demon capable of immortality, energy projection, telepathy, size-shifting, super strength, virtual invulnerability, reality manipulation, telekinesis, and matter transmutation and matter manipulation. He was able to reshape the entire planet Earth on a whim; had drained the souls of universes and destroyed entire planets and conquered dimensions, seemingly omniscient, granted powerful psionic powers to [[Psimon]]; and could create hordes of demons under his command, as well as open wormholes to other worlds. In addition, Trigon was easily able to defeat the Teen Titans and the Justice League. Trigon can also take on a human form to deceive others. In this form, he appears as an attractive and muscular man with blonde hair and glowing gold eyes.\n\nThe Children of Trigon each wield the power of a Deadly Sin bestowed as a gift from their father. Jared unleashes anger and wrath in his opponents. Jesse sees into the mind of his victims and transforms himself into the thing they envy most as well as taking on said envy's powers and abilities to add to his own. Jacob invokes lust into the hearts of his prey. [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]] also possesses this power, and is capable of inducing pride; however, doing so will leave her sick and nauseated for several days. It is not clear whether this is caused by the demonic power itself or by her revulsion towards using it.\n\n==Other versions==\n* In the ''[[DC Bombshells]]'' continuity, Das Trigon was a primal mountain spirit in the German Alps who had a change of heart after his lover Azaria gave birth to his daughter, Rachel. After Azaria's death, Trigon reverts to his monotonous ways and accepts [[Killer Frost]]'s offer for a place in their new world. Raven has visions of her father's horrendous actions and confronts him in Russia, where he was one of the mythological creatures working for [[Captain Cold]]. Raven offers her father a chance at redemption as he aids her in confronting [[Faora]]. Faora kills Trigon, resulting in Raven's magic becoming unstable and transforming her into a demonic beast. As she calms down, Faora injects herself with a sample of Raven's unstable demonic blood to become [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]].\n* Trigon appears in the ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us (comics)|Injustice: Gods Among Us comics]]''. He is seen when Raven scares away several nomadic tribes in the [[Sudan]], and is mentioned by the alternate [[Wonder Woman]] when Diana questions Raven's loyalty. Raven admits that she is Trigon's servant, and not Superman's, and that \"all shall bow down before him!\" \n* Trigon makes appearances in ''[[Tiny Titans]]'' as Raven's father and occasional substitute teacher. This version of Trigon is depicted as a silly, bumbling, but devoted father who often walks Raven to school. He enjoys skating wearing silly wigs, barbecuing if he can get the grill going, spending time with Raven and a toddler [[Kid Devil]] and he also enjoys surfing with Principal Slade from the school when they leave Lunchlady Darkseid in charge.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n[[File:TrigonTAS.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Trigon as seen in the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series.]]\n* Trigon appears in the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series voiced by [[Keith Szarabajka]] (in the first season) and by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] (in the fourth season). He serves as the main antagonist of the fourth season. More or less the same as his comic book counterpart, he is evil incarnate and probably the most terrible threat the Teen Titans face. He possesses vast reality manipulation powers, enabling him to reshape the surface of the Earth on a whim, revive the dead (either as superpowered undead servants or flesh and blood), and rip the fabric of space to transport his army across vast distances. He can bring a person's inner darkness to life, creating an exact replica of that person, down to their powers and memories. He also possesses more generic superhuman abilities such as firing energy blasts, creating force fields, and pyrokinesis (control of fire) [the latter of which he can impart to his servants]. In the season one episode \"Nevermore\", he first appears unnamed and as a manifestation of anger within [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]]'s mind. As the main antagonist in the fourth season, Trigon reappears with a different appearance. Trigon resurrects [[Deathstroke|Slade Wilson]] to force Raven into releasing him upon the Earth. In the three-part finale \"The End\", Trigon finally emerges and destroys the Earth; the [[Teen Titans]] are spared by a fraction of Raven's power before releasing Trigon. The Titans and Slade launch an all-out assault on Trigon, but he quickly defeats them. In the end, it is Raven (in her White form) that defeats Trigon using her own strengthened mystical abilities of pure light to obliterate Trigon, undoing the destruction he had caused in the process. It has been mentioned by the show's writers that Trigon was a nightmare of a villain to them due to his near-omnipotent powers, meaning that, realistically, the Teen Titans would stand no chance against the villain if he attacked them. The original 'Terror of Trigon' story contained a solution, due to the writers also being faced with the same problem, and the show adapted it from the comic books.\n* Trigon appears in the ''New Teen Titans'' segment of ''[[DC Nation Shorts]]'', with Kevin Michael Richardson reprising his role. In one short, he arrives at Titans Tower to visit Raven. When Raven tries to shut the door on him, Trigon sticks his huge fingernail in the door's way and gives Raven a stuffed bunny. Raven uses her powers to chop off his fingernail so the door will close and then uses her powers to tear the stuffed bunny to pieces.\n* Trigon appears in the ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' series, voiced again by Kevin Michael Richardson with no connection to the original ''Teen Titans'' series. This version of Trigon is portrayed as being a bumbling dad who wants what is best for his daughter, which is for her to accept her demon heritage and join him in destroying universes. The Teen Titans did not know that Trigon was Raven's father before his debut in \"Dog Hand\". Trigon's appearances have a reoccurring theme of tempting Raven to embrace her demonic heritage: buttering up his daughter's teammates by giving them new superpowers in \"Dog Hand\", making Raven jealous by bonding with [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]] in \"Caramel Apples\", and literally getting in his daughter's head to drive her insane in \"Crazy Day\".\n* Trigon appears in ''[[DC Super Hero Girls]]'', voiced once again by Kevin Michael Richardson. While he continues to want Raven to follow in his footsteps and practice dark magic in this version, he is much more forgiving and eventually lets Raven en-roll in Superhero High rather than home school her, eventually taking part in various parent boards and activities as well.\n[[File:TrigonTitansTVSeries.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Trigon as seen in ''Titans'']]\n* Trigon appears as the main antagonist in ''[[Titans (2018 TV series)|Titans]]'', portrayed by [[Seamus Dever]] in his human likeness. He is behind \"The Organization\" utilizing the [[Nuclear Family (comics)|Nuclear Family]] to hunt down Rachel and using Dr. Adamson as their caretaker as seen in the episodes \"Hawk and Dove\" and \"Together\". Trigon appears in human form in the episode \"Koriand'r\" where Rachel is persuaded by Angela Azarath to call him. As Trigon heals Garfield Logan while finding his existence fascinating as his human and animal sides are at war with each other, he tells Angela that he can begin destroying Earth when Rachel's heart break. In the episode \"Dick Grayson,\" Trigon subjects Dick Grayson to a dark future vision where Batman started killing his enemies leading to Dick killing him as part of Trigon's plot to have Dick embrace the darkness. In the episode \"Trigon,\" Hawk, Dove, and Jason Todd arrive at Angela's house, joining Donna and Kory in attempting to stop Trigon, but they all succumb to Trigon's powers. Trigon breaks Rachel's will by having the heroes seemingly beat Gar to death. With Rachel under his control, Trigon begins to destroy all life around him, starting with Angela. However, Gar survives and uses his friendship with Rachel to free her from Trigon. In turn, Rachel saves Dick before defeating her father and freeing the rest.\n\n===Film===\n* Trigon appears in the animated film ''[[Justice League vs. Teen Titans]]'', voiced by [[Jon Bernthal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvinsider.com/article/66981/meet-the-cast-of-justice-league-vs-teen-titans-dc-comics-animated-movie/|title=Roll Call: Meet the Cast of Justice League vs. Teen Titans|publisher=TVInsider.com|first=Rich|last=Sands|date=January 18, 2016|accessdate=January 18, 2016}}</ref> This version can create and send demons to possess others, a trait he uses to manipulate the Justice League into attacking the Teen Titans and capture his daughter Raven. He is also revealed by [[Ra's al Ghul]] to have created the Lazarus Pits. He is eventually defeated by the combined forces of the Teen Titans and the Justice League.\n* Trigon will appear in the animated film ''[[Justice League Dark: Apokolips War]]'' as a secondary antagonist alongside [[Darkseid]] (it's also the first time ever when Darkseid and Trigon will appear in the same storyline). It will be the third movie about this version of characters, following ''[[Justice League vs. Teen Titans]]'', ''[[Justice League Dark (film)|Justice League Dark]]'' and ''[[Teen Titans: The Judas Contract]]'' . Also, it will serve as a conclusion not only for Raven and Trigon's story, but for entire [[DC Animated Movie Universe]]. \n* Trigon makes a non-physical cameo in ''[[Teen Titans Go! To the Movies]]''. When Robin is sad due not getting his own movie, all the Titans remind him how they would have ended had he not enlisted them to be part of the Teen Titans, with Raven mentioning that if she had not been recruited, she would have most likely gone on to enslave many worlds alongside Trigon.\n* The ''Teen Titans Go!'' and ''Teen Titans'' animated series versions of Trigon appear as the main antagonists in ''[[Teen Titans Go! vs. Teen Titans]]'' with Kevin Michael Richardson reprising the role for both versions and [[Rhys Darby]] voicing his Master of Games alias. The 2013 ''Go!'' version of Trigon disguises himself as \"The Master of Games\" and pits the 2013 Titans against the original 2003 animated series versions of the Titans. He uses this as an opportunity to absorb his Raven's demonic powers to resurrect the 2003 Trigon, whom he plans to conquer the multiverse with. However, when his original counterpart continues to mock him and treat him like a servant, 2013 Trigon absorbs 2003 Trigon and transforms into a being known as '''Hexagon'''. With help from Titans throughout the multiverse, the two animated Titans teams are able to take back Raven's powers (thus destroying the original Trigon once more in the process) and send the 2013 Trigon into a zombie dimension.\n\n===Video games===\n* Trigon appears in ''[[Teen Titans (2006 video game)|Teen Titans]]'', not as a boss character, but as a playable character that can be unlocked in the Master of Games mini-game portion.\n* Trigon is featured in ''[[DC Universe Online]]''. He and his forces find their way to Earth and end up attacking Metropolis' Tomorrow District. He even takes control of Raven in a plot to destroy the city and captures the other Titan members Starfire, [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] and [[Donna Troy]] while corrupting them. When the players free the possessed Titans, Trigon's hold on Raven gets stronger, causing the players and the Titans to split up to find Raven. With help from [[Zatanna]], the players end up heading into the portal to Raven's soul self where Trigon uses Raven's possessed spirit to attack the players. After helping Raven fight the last Possessed Raven Spirit, Trigon's evil escapes to Earth. While being brought into Earth by [[Brother Blood]], Trigon then sends his demon minions to corrupt the citizens based on some of the Seven Deadly Sins. Brother Blood's plans to bring Trigon to Earth were thwarted by the players and the Sentinels of Magic. He is served by Demons, Embodiments of Sin, Soul Reavers, Soul Screams, Soul Shadows, Soul Strikers, Possessed Students, and Volatile Succubi. Alternately if you choose the Villain morality, you can help Brother Blood by entering Raven's psyche and destroying her resistance to Trigon which causes him to be unleashed through Raven. Trigon is also a main element in the DLC Pack \"Sons of Trigon\", in which players are taking to an alternate dimension in which Gotham has become a wasteland and Circe is trying to release Trigon from his prison. Players fight Circe or Wonder Woman in the alert \"Trigon\u00b4s Prison\" in which Trigon himself is a scenery element that, although impossible to damage, will attack the players and summon demons until either boss (Circe or Wonder Woman) has been defeated. The game also shows the other sons of Trigon: Julius (gluttony), James (greed), Jared (lust) and Jack (sloth).\n* Trigon appears as a non-playable character in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' as assistance to Raven's super move.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jenkins|first1=David|title=Injustice: Gods Among Us preview and interview \u2013 superhero kombat|url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/03/19/injustice-gods-among-us-preview-and-interview-superhero-kombat-3549395/|website=Metro|accessdate=7 February 2018|date=March 19, 2013}}</ref> During [[Wonder Woman]]'s fight with the alternate version of Raven, it is mentioned that the alternate iteration of [[Superman]]'s victory will hasten Trigon's return. Trigon can also be fought against in the [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] missions, making him one of the only unplayable bosses. In addition to these, Trigon also makes an appearance in [[Scorpion (Mortal Kombat)|Scorpion]]'s ending of classic battle where he had summoned Scorpion to the DC Universe.\n* Trigon is also featured in the mobile app ''[[Teeny Titans]]'', which is a figure battling game that is based on the show ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]''. He is one of the characters that player can battle and is also available as two figures that players can battle with and use in the game: one representing his original demonic form and another for his more dad-like incarnation.\n* Trigon appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]'', voiced by [[Darin De Paul]].\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n*A character named '''Roger Trigon''' appears in the tie-in novel ''Arrow: Vengeance'' based off the ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' TV series. This depiction serves as the head priest of the Church of Blood rather than the demonic entity it worships. Father Trigon founded the Church and found recruits from [[Starling City]]'s Zandia Orphanage which he was in charge of. Among his recruits were [[Brother Blood|Sebastian Blood]] and [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Cyrus Gold aka The Acolyte]]. Trigon played a huge part in helping Blood rebel against his parents, as well as the one who bestowed Blood with his skull mask. He died before the events of season 2, where Cyrus Gold took over as head of the orphanage while Sebastian Blood started his mayoral campaign (which is revealed to be controlled by [[Slade Wilson]] and [[Isabel Rochev]]).\n*Raven's image of Trigon also made an appearance in Raven's mind in ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' #5.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Teen Titans}}\n{{Justice League characters}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Trigon (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Characters created by George P\u00e9rez]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Marv Wolfman]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1981]]\n[[Category:DC Comics demons]]\n[[Category:DC Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:DC Comics deities]]\n[[Category:Fictional male deities]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional rapists]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can manipulate darkness or shadows]]\n[[Category:DC Comics cosmic entities]]\n[[Category:Seven deadly sins in popular culture]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|text=the Yasuhiro Nightow manga [[Trigun]]}}\n{{Infobox comics character <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n|image=Trigon (The New 52 version).jpg\n|converted = y\n|caption = Artwork for the cover of ''Teen Titans'' #23.4\u00a0(November 2013).<br>Art by [[Eber Ferreira]] and [[Eddy Barrows]]\n|character_name = Trigon\n|real_name =\n|publisher=[[DC Comics]]\n|debut = ''[[Teen Titans|New Teen Titans]]'' #2 (December 1980) (cameo)<br/>''[[Teen Titans|The New Teen Titans]]'' #4 (February 1981) (full appearance)\n|creators = [[Marv Wolfman]] (writer)<br>[[George P\u00e9rez]] (artist)\n|Base of operations =\n|species = [[Demon]]\n|homeworld = [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]]\n|alliances = [[Church of Blood]]\n|partners = <!-- optional -->\n|supports = <!-- optional -->\n|aliases = Skath, Ddrez, the [[Devil|devil]], Satan, Lucifer, Evil, Trigon the Terrible, Trigon the Ravager, The Lord of Madness, Lord Trigon, King Trigon, Master Trigon\n|powers =\n* Flight\n* Super strength\n* Invulnerability\n* Immortality\n* Metamorphic transformation\n* Transmutation of matter \n* Projection of thermal energy\n* Pyrokinesis\n* Annihilation of souls\n* Extremely high cosmic power\n* Cosmic consciousness\n* Telepathy\n* Telekinesis\n* Granting of powers\n|cat = super\n|subcat = DC Comics\n|hero =\n|villain = y\n|sortkey = Trigon (comics)\n}}\n\n'''Trigon''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|t|r|a\u026a|g|\u0259n}}) is a [[fictional]] [[supervillain]] published by [[DC Comics]].

In desperation, she reformed the [[Teen Titans]] with several new members in order to fight her father. The team was eventually able to defeat Trigon and seal him in an interdimensional prison. However, Raven still had to fight her father's influence as he was not completely destroyed. \n\nTrigon eventually escaped and came to Earth, taking control of Raven and destroying Azarath in the process. The Titans came together and tried to fight Trigon, but were contaminated by his demonic influence and killed Raven; this allowed the souls of Azarath to possess her and use her as a channel to kill Trigon\u2014the demonic possession had been part of a plan to defeat Trigon, as the Titans would never have killed Raven on their own\u2014blasting him out of existence with a beam of purifying light. Although Trigon is gone, his followers (led by [[Brother Blood]]) have tried to revive him several times.<ref>''Teen Titans'' #8. DC Comics.</ref><ref>''Teen Titans'' #10.

DC Comics.</ref>\n\nThree of Trigon's sons, '''Jacob''', '''Jared''' and '''Jesse''', play a significant role in his return to life. The brothers have the ability to induce the seven deadly sins in any living being; they can induce wrath (Jared), lust (Jacob) and envy (Jesse).<ref name=T4>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #4.

In this new timeline, Trigon makes his post-''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' debut in issue #1 of the ''[[Phantom Stranger]]''.<ref>''Phantom Stranger'' #1. DC Comics.</ref> In this incarnation, Trigon has an extra set of eyes, giving him six in total. He has struck a bargain with the Stranger to return his offspring Raven/Rachel Roth to him, in turn to spare Earth from his armies that were ready to search the Earth for her, having already destroyed Azarath years ago. In ''The New 52'', it has been revealed that Trigon has at least four children, where Raven is the youngest, her older brothers are named Belial, Ruskoff, and Suge; Belial is the oldest and most civilized, according to himself, of the three brothers.<ref>''Phantom Stranger'' #2. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nLater, Trigon returns to Earth, feeling confident in having swayed Raven to his side during their time together in the Under-Realms where time flows differently. It has been revealed that Trigon is the ruler of six kingdoms known as the Under-Realms, a collective title for the planets and dimensions under his rule and that he has grown bored with them. At first he ruled through his own power, then through conquest on the battlefield and finally through subterfuge. His ultimate goal is to unite all seven realms under the rule of Raven, whom he believes will mold them all in her own image, something only she can do as she has the capacity to love, something Trigon cannot do.\n\nAs part of [[Forever Evil|DC Villains Month]], Trigon replaced the Teen Titans as the main characters in their book for one issue named #23.1 with [[Deathstroke]] taking over #23.2. The Teen Titans book resumed publishing after Villains Month concluded. Though unconfirmed, the Villains Month event leaves Trigon's origins in question. Long ago, in another universe, a trinity of beings called the Divine attempted to eradicate the concept of evil through an item known as the Heart of Darkness. When the Divine return to a world they believed liberated, they find it in utter chaos along with the being they believe to be responsible, only because he appears not to be one of the planet's inhabitants. As they had done billions of times before, they sentence him and his two guards to the Heart of Darkness, that would feed on their evils. However, they were horrified when the stranger not only resisted but consumed the Heart of Darkness, along with the evils of a billion worlds, which heralded the true birth of Trigon. Now driven by an insatiable hunger for evil, Trigon moves slowly from universe to universe, spreading his devastating brand of evil in order to sate a hunger that knows no end.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #23.1-23.2. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nMuch later, Trigon encounters a woman wearing a suit of armor specifically crafted to counter his immense powers. Though neither is able to slay the other, Trigon is forced to retreat, swearing that members of his blood would return in their thousands to destroy the wearer of the Silent Armor. Trigon has since set his plans into action, only to run into the problem of most of the mothers of his children being unable to endure it, leaving Trigon with only three sons, all of whom he considers failures. Then, one day, he is brought a human from Earth known as Arella, who gives him his first daughter; Raven, the most powerful of Trigon's children, and the reason why Trigon now targets Earth for conquest.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nTrigon is pure evil and a powerful demon capable of immortality, energy projection, telepathy, size-shifting, super strength, virtual invulnerability, reality manipulation, telekinesis, and matter transmutation and matter manipulation. He was able to reshape the entire planet Earth on a whim; had drained the souls of universes and destroyed entire planets and conquered dimensions, seemingly omniscient, granted powerful psionic powers to [[Psimon]]; and could create hordes of demons under his command, as well as open wormholes to other worlds. In addition, Trigon was easily able to defeat the Teen Titans and the Justice League. Trigon can also take on a human form to deceive others. In this form, he appears as an attractive and muscular man with blonde hair and glowing gold eyes.\n\nThe Children of Trigon each wield the power of a Deadly Sin bestowed as a gift from their father. Jared unleashes anger and wrath in his opponents. Jesse sees into the mind of his victims and transforms himself into the thing they envy most as well as taking on said envy's powers and abilities to add to his own. Jacob invokes lust into the hearts of his prey. [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]] also possesses this power, and is capable of inducing pride; however, doing so will leave her sick and nauseated for several days. It is not clear whether this is caused by the demonic power itself or by her revulsion towards using it.\n\n==Other versions==\n* In the ''[[DC Bombshells]]'' continuity, Das Trigon was a primal mountain spirit in the German Alps who had a change of heart after his lover Azaria gave birth to his daughter, Rachel. After Azaria's death, Trigon reverts to his monotonous ways and accepts [[Killer Frost]]'s offer for a place in their new world. Raven has visions of her father's horrendous actions and confronts him in Russia, where he was one of the mythological creatures working for [[Captain Cold]]. Raven offers her father a chance at redemption as he aids her in confronting [[Faora]]. Faora kills Trigon, resulting in Raven's magic becoming unstable and transforming her into a demonic beast. As she calms down, Faora injects herself with a sample of Raven's unstable demonic blood to become [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]].\n* Trigon appears in the ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us (comics)|Injustice: Gods Among Us comics]]''. He is seen when Raven scares away several nomadic tribes in the [[Sudan]], and is mentioned by the alternate [[Wonder Woman]] when Diana questions Raven's loyalty. Raven admits that she is Trigon's servant, and not Superman's, and that \"all shall bow down before him!\" \n* Trigon makes appearances in ''[[Tiny Titans]]'' as Raven's father and occasional substitute teacher. This version of Trigon is depicted as a silly, bumbling, but devoted father who often walks Raven to school. He enjoys skating wearing silly wigs, barbecuing if he can get the grill going, spending time with Raven and a toddler [[Kid Devil]] and he also enjoys surfing with Principal Slade from the school when they leave Lunchlady Darkseid in charge.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n[[File:TrigonTAS.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Trigon as seen in the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series.]]\n* Trigon appears in the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series voiced by [[Keith Szarabajka]] (in the first season) and by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] (in the fourth season). He serves as the main antagonist of the fourth season. More or less the same as his comic book counterpart, he is evil incarnate and probably the most terrible threat the Teen Titans face. He possesses vast reality manipulation powers, enabling him to reshape the surface of the Earth on a whim, revive the dead (either as superpowered undead servants or flesh and blood), and rip the fabric of space to transport his army across vast distances. He can bring a person's inner darkness to life, creating an exact replica of that person, down to their powers and memories. He also possesses more generic superhuman abilities such as firing energy blasts, creating force fields, and pyrokinesis (control of fire) [the latter of which he can impart to his servants]. In the season one episode \"Nevermore\", he first appears unnamed and as a manifestation of anger within [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]]'s mind. As the main antagonist in the fourth season, Trigon reappears with a different appearance. Trigon resurrects [[Deathstroke|Slade Wilson]] to force Raven into releasing him upon the Earth. In the three-part finale \"The End\", Trigon finally emerges and destroys the Earth; the [[Teen Titans]] are spared by a fraction of Raven's power before releasing Trigon. The Titans and Slade launch an all-out assault on Trigon, but he quickly defeats them. In the end, it is Raven (in her White form) that defeats Trigon using her own strengthened mystical abilities of pure light to obliterate Trigon, undoing the destruction he had caused in the process. It has been mentioned by the show's writers that Trigon was a nightmare of a villain to them due to his near-omnipotent powers, meaning that, realistically, the Teen Titans would stand no chance against the villain if he attacked them. The original 'Terror of Trigon' story contained a solution, due to the writers also being faced with the same problem, and the show adapted it from the comic books.\n* Trigon appears in the ''New Teen Titans'' segment of ''[[DC Nation Shorts]]'', with Kevin Michael Richardson reprising his role. In one short, he arrives at Titans Tower to visit Raven. When Raven tries to shut the door on him, Trigon sticks his huge fingernail in the door's way and gives Raven a stuffed bunny. Raven uses her powers to chop off his fingernail so the door will close and then uses her powers to tear the stuffed bunny to pieces.\n* Trigon appears in the ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' series, voiced again by Kevin Michael Richardson with no connection to the original ''Teen Titans'' series. This version of Trigon is portrayed as being a bumbling dad who wants what is best for his daughter, which is for her to accept her demon heritage and join him in destroying universes. The Teen Titans did not know that Trigon was Raven's father before his debut in \"Dog Hand\". Trigon's appearances have a reoccurring theme of tempting Raven to embrace her demonic heritage: buttering up his daughter's teammates by giving them new superpowers in \"Dog Hand\", making Raven jealous by bonding with [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]] in \"Caramel Apples\", and literally getting in his daughter's head to drive her insane in \"Crazy Day\".\n* Trigon appears in ''[[DC Super Hero Girls]]'', voiced once again by Kevin Michael Richardson. While he continues to want Raven to follow in his footsteps and practice dark magic in this version, he is much more forgiving and eventually lets Raven en-roll in Superhero High rather than home school her, eventually taking part in various parent boards and activities as well.\n[[File:TrigonTitansTVSeries.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Trigon as seen in ''Titans'']]\n* Trigon appears as the main antagonist in ''[[Titans (2018 TV series)|Titans]]'', portrayed by [[Seamus Dever]] in his human likeness. He is behind \"The Organization\" utilizing the [[Nuclear Family (comics)|Nuclear Family]] to hunt down Rachel and using Dr. Adamson as their caretaker as seen in the episodes \"Hawk and Dove\" and \"Together\". Trigon appears in human form in the episode \"Koriand'r\" where Rachel is persuaded by Angela Azarath to call him. As Trigon heals Garfield Logan while finding his existence fascinating as his human and animal sides are at war with each other, he tells Angela that he can begin destroying Earth when Rachel's heart break. In the episode \"Dick Grayson,\" Trigon subjects Dick Grayson to a dark future vision where Batman started killing his enemies leading to Dick killing him as part of Trigon's plot to have Dick embrace the darkness. In the episode \"Trigon,\" Hawk, Dove, and Jason Todd arrive at Angela's house, joining Donna and Kory in attempting to stop Trigon, but they all succumb to Trigon's powers. Trigon breaks Rachel's will by having the heroes seemingly beat Gar to death. With Rachel under his control, Trigon begins to destroy all life around him, starting with Angela. However, Gar survives and uses his friendship with Rachel to free her from Trigon. In turn, Rachel saves Dick before defeating her father and freeing the rest.\n\n===Film===\n* Trigon appears in the animated film ''[[Justice League vs. Teen Titans]]'', voiced by [[Jon Bernthal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvinsider.com/article/66981/meet-the-cast-of-justice-league-vs-teen-titans-dc-comics-animated-movie/|title=Roll Call: Meet the Cast of Justice League vs. Teen Titans|publisher=TVInsider.com|first=Rich|last=Sands|date=January 18, 2016|accessdate=January 18, 2016}}</ref> This version can create and send demons to possess others, a trait he uses to manipulate the Justice League into attacking the Teen Titans and capture his daughter Raven. He is also revealed by [[Ra's al Ghul]] to have created the Lazarus Pits. He is eventually defeated by the combined forces of the Teen Titans and the Justice League.\n* Trigon will appear in the animated film ''[[Justice League Dark: Apokolips War]]'' as a secondary antagonist alongside [[Darkseid]] (it's also the first time ever when Darkseid and Trigon will apear in the same storyline). It will be the third movie about this version of characters, following ''[[Justice League vs. Teen Titans]]'', ''[[Justice League Dark (film)|Justice League Dark]]'' and ''[[Teen Titans: The Judas Contract]]'' . Also, it will serve as a conclusion not only for Raven and Trigon's story, but for entire [[DC Animated Movie Universe]]. \n* Trigon makes a non-physical cameo in ''[[Teen Titans Go! To the Movies]]''. When Robin is sad due not getting his own movie, all the Titans remind him how they would have ended had he not enlisted them to be part of the Teen Titans, with Raven mentioning that if she had not been recruited, she would have most likely gone on to enslave many worlds alongside Trigon.\n* The ''Teen Titans Go!'' and ''Teen Titans'' animated series versions of Trigon appear as the main antagonists in ''[[Teen Titans Go! vs. Teen Titans]]'' with Kevin Michael Richardson reprising the role for both versions and [[Rhys Darby]] voicing his Master of Games alias. The 2013 ''Go!'' version of Trigon disguises himself as \"The Master of Games\" and pits the 2013 Titans against the original 2003 animated series versions of the Titans. He uses this as an opportunity to absorb his Raven's demonic powers to resurrect the 2003 Trigon, whom he plans to conquer the multiverse with. However, when his original counterpart continues to mock him and treat him like a servant, 2013 Trigon absorbs 2003 Trigon and transforms into a being known as '''Hexagon'''. With help from Titans throughout the multiverse, the two animated Titans teams are able to take back Raven's powers (thus destroying the original Trigon once more in the process) and send the 2013 Trigon into a zombie dimension.\n\n===Video games===\n* Trigon appears in ''[[Teen Titans (2006 video game)|Teen Titans]]'', not as a boss character, but as a playable character that can be unlocked in the Master of Games mini-game portion.\n* Trigon is featured in ''[[DC Universe Online]]''. He and his forces find their way to Earth and end up attacking Metropolis' Tomorrow District. He even takes control of Raven in a plot to destroy the city and captures the other Titan members Starfire, [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] and [[Donna Troy]] while corrupting them. When the players free the possessed Titans, Trigon's hold on Raven gets stronger, causing the players and the Titans to split up to find Raven. With help from [[Zatanna]], the players end up heading into the portal to Raven's soul self where Trigon uses Raven's possessed spirit to attack the players. After helping Raven fight the last Possessed Raven Spirit, Trigon's evil escapes to Earth. While being brought into Earth by [[Brother Blood]], Trigon then sends his demon minions to corrupt the citizens based on some of the Seven Deadly Sins. Brother Blood's plans to bring Trigon to Earth were thwarted by the players and the Sentinels of Magic. He is served by Demons, Embodiments of Sin, Soul Reavers, Soul Screams, Soul Shadows, Soul Strikers, Possessed Students, and Volatile Succubi. Alternately if you choose the Villain morality, you can help Brother Blood by entering Raven's psyche and destroying her resistance to Trigon which causes him to be unleashed through Raven. Trigon is also a main element in the DLC Pack \"Sons of Trigon\", in which players are taking to an alternate dimension in which Gotham has become a wasteland and Circe is trying to release Trigon from his prison. Players fight Circe or Wonder Woman in the alert \"Trigon\u00b4s Prison\" in which Trigon himself is a scenery element that, although impossible to damage, will attack the players and summon demons until either boss (Circe or Wonder Woman) has been defeated. The game also shows the other sons of Trigon: Julius (gluttony), James (greed), Jared (lust) and Jack (sloth).\n* Trigon appears as a non-playable character in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' as assistance to Raven's super move.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jenkins|first1=David|title=Injustice: Gods Among Us preview and interview \u2013 superhero kombat|url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/03/19/injustice-gods-among-us-preview-and-interview-superhero-kombat-3549395/|website=Metro|accessdate=7 February 2018|date=March 19, 2013}}</ref> During [[Wonder Woman]]'s fight with the alternate version of Raven, it is mentioned that the alternate iteration of [[Superman]]'s victory will hasten Trigon's return. Trigon can also be fought against in the [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] missions, making him one of the only unplayable bosses. In addition to these, Trigon also makes an appearance in [[Scorpion (Mortal Kombat)|Scorpion]]'s ending of classic battle where he had summoned Scorpion to the DC Universe.\n* Trigon is also featured in the mobile app ''[[Teeny Titans]]'', which is a figure battling game that is based on the show ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]''. He is one of the characters that player can battle and is also available as two figures that players can battle with and use in the game: one representing his original demonic form and another for his more dad-like incarnation.\n* Trigon appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]'', voiced by [[Darin De Paul]].\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n*A character named '''Roger Trigon''' appears in the tie-in novel ''Arrow: Vengeance'' based off the ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' TV series. This depiction serves as the head priest of the Church of Blood rather than the demonic entity it worships. Father Trigon founded the Church and found recruits from [[Starling City]]'s Zandia Orphanage which he was in charge of. Among his recruits were [[Brother Blood|Sebastian Blood]] and [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Cyrus Gold aka The Acolyte]]. Trigon played a huge part in helping Blood rebel against his parents, as well as the one who bestowed Blood with his skull mask. He died before the events of season 2, where Cyrus Gold took over as head of the orphanage while Sebastian Blood started his mayoral campaign (which is revealed to be controlled by [[Slade Wilson]] and [[Isabel Rochev]]).\n*Raven's image of Trigon also made an appearance in Raven's mind in ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' #5.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Teen Titans}}\n{{Justice League characters}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Trigon (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Characters created by George P\u00e9rez]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Marv Wolfman]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1981]]\n[[Category:DC Comics demons]]\n[[Category:DC Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:DC Comics deities]]\n[[Category:Fictional male deities]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional rapists]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can manipulate darkness or shadows]]\n[[Category:DC Comics cosmic entities]]\n[[Category:Seven deadly sins in popular culture]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFilm:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: apear \u2192 appear", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigon_(comics)"}

Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist/co-writer [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], the character first appeared in ''[[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]'' #14 (August [[1977 in comics|1977]]). Sabretooth was originally portrayed as a non-powered [[serial killer]] but was later written as a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] possessing bestial superhuman abilities, most notably a rapid healing factor, razor-sharp fangs and claws, and superhuman senses. He is a vicious [[assassination|assassin]], responsible for numerous deaths both as a paid mercenary and for his personal pleasure. Accounts as to the origin of his enmity with Wolverine are conflicted. It is known that Wolverine and Sabretooth were participants of the [[Cold War]] [[supersoldier]] program [[Weapon X]], and that Sabretooth saw Wolverine as competition and therefore antagonized him. While Wolverine is depicted as suppressing his more savage qualities, Sabretooth does the opposite and embraces them, until the events of the 2014 storyline \"[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]\".\n\nThe character has appeared in several [[X-Men]] [[animation|animated series]] and [[video game]]s, and was portrayed by [[Tyler Mane]] in the [[X-Men (film)|first ''X-Men'' film]] and by [[Liev Schreiber]] in the 2009 film ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]''. In May 2008, [[Wizard (magazine)|''Wizard'']] magazine ranked Sabretooth #193 of the 200 best comic book characters of all time.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wizarduniverse.com/051308top200characters.html |title= The 200 Greatest Comic Book Characters of All Time |first= |last= |author= |authorlink= |date= May 13, 2008 |publisher= [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard: The Magazine of Comics, Entertainment and Pop Culture]] |trans-title=|doi= |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090616181416/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/051308top200characters.html |archivedate= June 16, 2009 |accessdate= April 19, 2011}}</ref> In 2009, Sabretooth was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 44th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/44.html Sabretooth is number 44] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104231922/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/44.html |date=2014-01-04 }}.

Sabretooth was initially conceived as a recurring antagonist for [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], whom he fights several times. He works for a time with [[Constrictor (comics)|the Constrictor]] as a partner-in-crime, and clashes repeatedly with Iron Fist and [[Luke Cage|Power Man]].<ref name=\"Power Man and Iron Fist #66\">''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #66</ref><ref name=\"Power Man and Iron Fist #84\">''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #84</ref> Sabretooth also appeared in comics such as ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]''. Chris Claremont introduced him as a minor [[X-Men]] villain, a member of [[Marauders (comics)|the Marauders]], during the \"[[Mutant Massacre]]\" crossover in 1986. He rose to greater prominence when he was split off from the Marauders and became a recurring antagonist of an individual member of the X-Men, Wolverine. Sabretooth was subsequently featured in [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] and [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] [[Comic book|comics]] including ''Sabretooth and [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]'' and ''Sabretooth: In the Red Zone'', and even had his own ongoing reprint series in the mid-1990s, ''Sabretooth Classics''.\n\n===Origin===\nChris Claremont had meant for Sabretooth to be Wolverine's father, though this was contradicted  by subsequent writers. Claremont, when asked what he had intended to be the relationship between Wolverine and Sabretooth, stated:\n\n<blockquote>Father and son. That's why Sabretooth always considered Logan \"sloppy seconds\" to his \"original\" / \"real deal.\" The other critical element in my presentation of their relationship was that, in their whole life, Logan has never defeated Sabretooth in a knock-down, drag-out, kill-or-be-killed berserker fight. By the same token, on every one of his birthdays, Sabretooth has always managed to find him, no matter where Logan was or what he was doing, and come within an inch of killing him. For no other reason than to remind him that he could.<ref name=\"x-mencomics.com\">[http://x-mencomics.com/xfan/forums/showthread.php?t=14411&page=13&pp=20] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928044912/http://x-mencomics.com/xfan/forums/showthread.php?t=14411&page=13&pp=20 |date=September 28, 2007 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[genetics|Genetic]] tests performed by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] confirmed that Sabretooth and Wolverine were not father and son.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #42</ref>\n\nAn interviewer asked [[Paul Jenkins (writer)|Paul Jenkins]] if [[Dog Logan]] was Sabretooth.

The original true Sabretooth reappears dressed in the [[Jim Lee]] costume in ''X-Men Forever'', which would make the weaker clone the one dressed in the John Byrne costume. Claremont claims he always meant for the Sabretooth dressed in the Byrne costume to be later [[outed]] as a clone of the original true Sabretooth. Claremont stated: \"Speaking specifically of the cast of ''X-Men Forever'', one character who's becoming more enticing is Sabretooth, in part because (at least as it relates to my conception of him) very little is actually known. They then filled his skeleton with adamantium. At this specific point of his life, readers haven't really seen that much of him over the years, since the Sabes that's shown up most over the time is a less-endowed copy cloned from spare cells by Mr. Sinister.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://xmennation.com/articles/latest-articles/creating-claremont-an-exclusive-interview-with-mr-chris-claremont.html| last=Lurie | first=Jordan | title=Creating Claremont - An Exclusive Interview with Mr. Chris Claremont | work=X-Men Nation | date= June 3, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Early life===\nSabretooth's real name is believed to be Victor Creed.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #5 (February 1992)</ref> Sabretooth's memories have been tampered with by clandestine organizations such as [[Weapon X]] and so much of what appears to be his past is not of credible account.<ref>Conflicting accounts in ''Origin II'', ''Origins: Sabretooth'', ''X-Men'', ''Uncanny X-Men'' in the 90s, and the 90s ''Sabretooth'' limited series</ref>{{issue|date=April 2017}} The clearest accounts of Victor's childhood begin with him murdering his brother Luther Creed over a piece of pie.<ref name=\"X-Men Origins - Sabretooth\">''X-Men Origins - Sabretooth''</ref> His father then chains him in the basement like an animal and systematically pulls out Victor's elongated canines, which perennially grow back.

Saul Creed was a tracker and hunter, while Clara Creed was an animal handler. They helped track down the feral James \"Logan\" Howlett for a circus.<ref>''Origin II'' #2</ref> They also helped Logan escape after the man was experimented on by [[Mister Sinister|Nathaniel Essex]], and the three go on the run.<ref>''Origin II'' #3</ref> Saul perceives Logan to be stealing Clara, leading to Saul tipping Essex off regarding Logan's location. In the ensuing chaos, Logan accidentally kills Clara, although her healing factor later revives Clara. Saul, not knowing this, blames Essex for Clara's death, and the two men seek Essex out, Saul revealing that Clara was his sister.<ref>''Origin II'' #4</ref> Logan, however, finds out that Saul betrayed them to Essex, and drowns Saul in a potion of Essex's. Horrified by this, Clara asks Wolverine to never look for her again. Victor was then informed about his brother's death.<ref>''Origin II'' #5</ref>\n\nIn an early tale, Logan lives in a small [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfoot community]]. One day, Sabretooth tracks him down in Canada, and seemingly murders his one-time teammate's lover [[Silver Fox (comics)|Silver Fox]] on Logan's birthday, after Silver Fox rejects him. In this tale, it is indicated that Logan did not have particularly strong feelings for Silver Fox, and that the murder was simply the last straw in a series of grievances he held against Sabretooth.<ref name=\"Wolverine #10\">''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #10</ref> Creed eventually adopts a tradition of tracking Logan down on his foe's birthday with the intention of fighting.<ref name=\"X-Men Origins - Sabretooth\"/>\n\n===Early history===\nCreed is recruited into a top secret [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[covert operation|covert ops]] unit known as [[Team X (comics)|Team X]], with allies John Wraith ([[Kestrel (Marvel Comics)|Kestrel]]), Logan (Wolverine), Silver Fox (whose death was a hoax), and David North ([[David North (comics)|Maverick]]).

Victor and Logan form a team of rebel mutants, and Victor falls in love with a mutant named Holo. Eventually, Creed grows tired of the fighting and wants to leave with Holo, but she has already decided against it. In the final conflict, Holo is mortally wounded. Creed blames Logan for her death.<ref>''First X-Men'' #1-5</ref>\n\nNext, Sabretooth is recruited by the [[Weapon X]] program, but it is unknown what, if any, enhancements he receives.

Their quest leads them to the telepath Aldo Ferro, the Psi-Borg. Ferro overwhelms them all with psychic illusions, concluding with a toothed tree which apparently consumes Creed.<ref>''Wolverine'' #60-64</ref>\n\nSuffering from severe bloodlust, Sabretooth hires telepathic mutant [[Birdy (comics)|Birdy]] to help him keep his urges in check by providing what he calls \"the glow\", a [[psychic]] blast that satiates his bloodlust and numbs the pain of his suppressed memories as a youth, allowing himself control for short periods.<ref>''Sabretooth'' limited series 1994</ref>{{issue|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Betrayal of the X-Men and brief alliance with X-Factor===\n{{Overly detailed|date=December 2014|section=yes}}\nA short time later, Birdy is killed by Sabretooth's grown son Graydon, who now has a hatred for mutants, especially his father. Without \"the glow\", Sabretooth slips into a murderous killing spree. This culminates in a clash with Maverick, whom Sabretooth defeats. He escapes, claiming only Wolverine can do what needs to be done to the psychotic Creed. Afterward, Maverick approaches the X-Men in [[Japan]], and an ancient telepath, comatose since the nuclear bomb that destroyed [[Hiroshima]], who mind-links with Creed and the team discovers Creed's psychosis was rooted in his time as a CIA operative. On a mission, he slaughtered a target, his wife (a \"frail\" for Creed), and a little boy. The look in the boy's eyes has followed Creed ever since. Ultimately, Sabretooth attacks [[Charles Xavier]], leader of the X-Men. As Xavier infiltrates Creed's mind, he discovers that every victim Sabretooth has killed is remembered by the villain. Xavier is confident this means Creed values human life, and there is hope for the mutant. Sabretooth is incarcerated, as a wanted murderer, in a holographic environment because Xavier does not want him to roam on the grounds. Sabretooth is angered, but grudgingly stays with the team. During his incarceration, he assists in battles against the [[X-Cutioner]] and the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]]. Caliban, free of Apocalypse's control, kidnaps the X-Man [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] in exchange for Sabretooth. When Sabretooth arrives, he mauls Caliban's face, and Caliban flees.{{issue|date=January 2015}} Wolverine, who had left the team after his [[adamantium]] was removed by [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], returns, and the villain escapes for a fight. This leads to Wolverine stabbing one of his claws into Sabretooth's brain.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #90</ref>\n\nThe newer, gentler Sabretooth is frequently nursed by [[X-Force]] member [[Tabitha Smith|Boomer]]; he eventually reveals that he was feigning helplessness, and attacks Boomer. Psylocke saves the young mutant's life, and she uses her psionic knife to disable him. However, this no longer works because his brain injury from Wolverine freed him from the need for \"the glow\", furthermore rendering him resistant to telepathic detection and control. Retaliating, Sabretooth nearly kills Psylocke, but he is finally confronted by the X-Men, who incapacitate him.<ref>''Sabretooth: In The Red Zone''</ref>\n\nHe is turned over to the custody of Dr. [[Valerie Cooper]], who fits him with an explosive restraining collar and forces him to participate as a member of the government-sponsored [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] team.{{issue|date=April 2012}} Creed later admits he was a \"sleeper\" agent with the mission of executing X-Factor members the government could not control.{{issue|date=April 2012}} He eventually escapes,{{issue|date=April 2012}} and returns once more to mercenary work.{{issue|date=April 2012}} Under unknown circumstances he gains adamantium skeleton and claws.<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol. 2) #126</ref> Sabretooth is captured, along with Wolverine, by Apocalypse, who forces the two to fight each other for the right to become Apocalypse's new [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Horseman]], Death.

In ''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #166, Sabretooth reveals that by means of genetic enhancement the Weapon X program has increased his strength and accelerated his healing factor. Eventually he escaped the program again and resumed working solo. However, he sometimes worked on a team, such as when he worked with several other villains to locate the [[Identity Disc]], a record of heroes' secret identities. This ended up being a ruse, though Nick Fury had the real disc.<ref>''Identity Disc'' limited series, 2004</ref>{{issue|date=April 2017}}\n\nLater, in [[Canada]], he encountered [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] and the newest [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]].

Their reasons for pursuing him remained unknown, but two of them\u2014[[Sangre (comics)|Sangre]] and [[Serafina (Marvel)|Serafina]]\u2014were tracking him. Sangre activated a singularity generator that annihilated most of the town and killed all its citizens, except for a little girl whom Serafina deliberately shielded from the destruction so there would be a witness to what had happened. He later encountered two more of the Children\u2014[[Aguja (comics)|Aguja]] and [[Fuego (comics)|Fuego]]. They attacked him and temporarily neutralized his healing factor, but he managed to escape regardless, only to end up at the Xavier Institute later that night seeking sanctuary.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\nIt is revealed that the Children are after Creed because he has seen them and knows who they are, while the public believed the X-Men destroyed the town. It is only when [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], the leader of the team, injected Nano-Sentinels into Sabretooth's blood that they take him along with their fight against the Children, a factor that one of the Children exploited. At one point, [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] saved his life during the battle. Sabretooth rewards him with some inside information: \"The first time you turn your back, you're dead.\" Following the incident on [[Providence (comics)|Providence]], Creed escaped the X-Men, but was hurled into the middle of the [[Pacific Ocean]] by Cable.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\nWriter [[Mike Carey (British writer)|Mike Carey]] noted he has no plans on redeeming Sabretooth, saying, \"I'm not going to try and show a heroic side to Sabretooth's nature; I\u2019m not going to [[retroactive continuity|retcon]] him so that there are reasons for his actions that make him forgivable.

I'm not making him into a hero; I'm making him into a team member and there are reasons within the first storyline as to why he ends up fighting alongside the X-Men against another enemy.

A fight soon breaks out with Wolverine tossing Sabretooth through a window. During the fight, Wolverine thinks back to the time when Sabretooth had, supposedly, killed Silver Fox. He remembers Sabretooth saying, \"''quod sum eris''\" and asks what it means. Sabretooth explains that it means \"I am what you will be.\" Wolverine loses control and calls Sabretooth insane before placing his fist against Sabretooth's throat. Creed tells him if he extracts his claws, he will rip his heart out. Wolverine replies, \"Let 'er rip\", and pops his claws into Sabretooth's throat.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #50</ref> Wolverine later regains consciousness and finds himself chained to the roof of the [[Blackbird (comics)|Blackbird]]. He quickly breaks free of the chains and is surprised to find Sabretooth piloting the jet. Wolverine breaks into the cockpit and begins choking Sabretooth with one of the chains and causes him to crash.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\nThe two emerge from the flaming wreckage and, while healing from the injuries sustained in the crash, begin fighting once again until separated by a lightning bolt, courtesy of Wolverine's former teammate and current Queen of [[Wakanda]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]].<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #51</ref> A short time later Sabretooth is chained up in the royal palace of Wakanda and complains to Wolverine, Storm, and the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]. Sabretooth snaps the chains and escapes into the jungle, with the Black Panther quickly giving chase. The Black Panther catches up to him and the two begin to fight, with Sabretooth quickly gaining the upper hand. He holds the Black Panther off the ground by the neck, preparing to strike a killing blow, when Wolverine suddenly appears and slices off Sabretooth's left hand.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #53</ref>\n\nOnce the fight between the Black Panther and Sabretooth is broken up by Wolverine, Sabretooth is brought back to the Wakandan Palace and placed in a [[vibranium]] holding cell and guarded around the clock. The battle scene between the Black Panther and Sabretooth then becomes the focus of why Wolverine was brought to the palace in the first place. It seems that amongst the bones from an elephant graveyard, there are also some unidentified skeletal remains of another offshoot of Homo sapiens called \"Lupus sapiens\". The Black Panther and Wolverine are discussing that instead of there being one evolutionary path between humans and monkeys, that there may also have been one that developed from lupines. It is believed at this point that [[Romulus (comics)|Romulus]] is the first of this race, and it is revealed that he has been the one behind [[Daken]]'s attacks, and the driving force behind the Weapon X program. After the discussion with the Black Panther, Wolverine is awakened by the stench of blood from something that has a scent similar to his and Sabretooth's and also something else. It turns out to be an enhanced [[Wild Child (comics)|Wild Child]] who has now surpassed the abilities of both Wolverine and Sabretooth, thanks to Romulus. Wild Child strikes Wolverine with poison-tipped claws and incapacitates him for two days. When Wolverine awakens, he finds Sasquatch, [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], and [[Feral (comics)|Feral]] and her sister [[Thornn]] ready to go back with him to the Weapon X complex so that they might get to the bottom of this lupine mystery.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}\n\nOnce they all arrive at the Weapon X facility, Wolverine is plagued by memories that seem to mix past and present together and all of them controlled by Romulus. Wolverine goes in alone telling the others to stay put on the plane, but they do not listen. Feral and Thornn, who were granted their lupine appearance back by Romulus, are separated and Sabretooth, reduced to his animalistic state, has gutted Feral and she is dying. Wolverine gets Feral back to the ship and finds that Thornn and Wolfsbane are in shock from the encounter, along with Sasquatch having been incapacitated by Wild Child. Once they are on their way, Wolverine goes back to the Xavier Institute and asks [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] to give him back the Muramasa sword, which he gave to Scott in case he was too out of control and needed to be put down for good. Cyclops only does this after [[Emma Frost]] reads Wolverine's mind and sees the horrors that Wolverine has been witnessing when he dreams: the horrors committed by Victor Creed throughout the years. Sword in hand, Wolverine then sets out to find and kill Sabretooth once and for all.<ref name=\"Wolverine vol. 3 #55\">''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #55</ref>\n\nAfter the events in \"Evolution\", Wolverine has been waiting for an unspecified length of time at Silver Fox's cabin in the Canadian wilderness. Sabretooth finally shows up and immediately attacks him. In the ensuing battle Wolverine cuts off Sabretooth's left arm with the [[Muramasa]]. Sabretooth, still in his animalistic state tries to re-attach his arm allowing his healing factor to kick in, but it does not work. Wolverine explains to a bewildered Creed that it is because the sword interrupts the healing factor and that he has to finally kill Sabretooth for what he's done. Managing to regain control and speak between grunts, Sabretooth tells him, \"Do it\". Wolverine then decapitates Sabretooth, finally putting an end to his long-time enemy. Logan then walks away, leaving both Creed's body and head in the snow to rot.<ref name=\"Wolverine vol. 3 #55\"/>\n\n===Hell===\nSabretooth appears to Wolverine, leashed and under the control of the [[Satan|Devil]] himself, who has claimed to have broken Victor's will.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 4 #3</ref> Victor shows defiance by striking the face of his defeated master after Wolverine uses his broken bone claws to pin Satan to a wall.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 4 #4</ref> After Wolverine has an interrupted discussion with his father, it is shown that Victor wields Satan's sword, which is being held as a symbol of who is the ruler of Hell. Wolverine fights Victor again, mentioning, as he beheads him once more, that there's no coming back when you're killed by the sword. Wolverine leaves Victor's beheaded soul lying in the pit of Hell.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 4 #5</ref>\n\n===Return===\n{{Overly detailed|date=December 2014|section=yes}}\nIt was later revealed that the Sabretooth beheaded by Logan was in fact one of several clones grown by Romulus.

Sabretooth says he'll miss an important meeting by going, and kills the Yakuza. Creed sets a trap for Logan before heading to his meeting, but it fails causing the two to battle. Their battling ends with them surrounded by Yakuza, the Hand, the new Silver Samurai and Wolverine's adopted daughter. Logan goes to save his daughter, while Victor grabs the Silver Samurai.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #300</ref> It is later revealed Creed is working with Mystique again as well as the Mind Ninjas.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #301</ref> Mystique disables Wolverine while Sabretooth heads on to the next part of his plan. He escapes with the man who hired him, Azuma Goda, to cause a war between the Hand and the Yakuza.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #302</ref> As Goda reveals his master plan of becoming a ruler of Japan by proxies, Sabretooth has his own plans. He allows Wolverine to slip in and try to kill Goda while he saves Mystique from Lord Deathstrike and makes him an offer. The three of them arrive at a meeting of the remaining leaders of the fighting factions, who are deciding the fate of Tokyo and kill them all as Sabretooth declares himself the new \"invisible\" ruler of East Asia.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #303</ref> Sabretooth later holds a party with but Wolverine crashes the party and defeats all the guests, he then tells Sabretooth \"Happy birthday, from your old pal Wolverine\".<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #304</ref>\n\nSabretooth trains Kade Kilgore in combat and tactics, with the purpose of attacking the Jean Grey School. Sabretooth tells Kilgore the best way to destroy them is to hit them in the heart, physical or metaphorical. Kilgore figures that the heart of the school is Beast (Henry McCoy). Sabretooth ambushes the latter managing to physically wound him before taking his fight to [[Abigail Brand]], Hank's girlfriend. With help from Beast, Abigail is able to blast Sabretooth away.<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #8</ref>\n\nLater while investigating the grave of Sabretooth, Wolverine finds that the body still is in it, which indicates that Sabretooth wasn't resurrected. Wolverine also discovers that it was apparently Romulus behind everything and after being beaten, he is saved by a mysterious woman with long red hair who tells him to go to the Weapon X facility, but she disappears before he gets further answers. Wolverine goes to explore the facility only to find that someone has been experimenting with Sabretooth's genetics and has cloned him, one awakens, who Wolverine recognizes by scent to be the real Sabretooth.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #310</ref> After fighting the Sabretooth clones, Wolverine encounters the mysterious woman again, claiming that she's Romulus' twin sister, Remus.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #311</ref> She reveals that the whole \"Lupine Sapiens\" story was an elaborate hoax by her brother intended to be a ruse for his real goal of creating a master race of natural mutants artificially enhanced by a new type of adamantium, using Wolverine as a template.{{issue|date=January 2015}} After tracking Romulus, Wolverine brutally attacks and incapacitates Sabretooth.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #312</ref> While Wolverine fights Romulus, Sabretooth fights with Cloak who has been investigating with wolverine.

He notes that he can feel his former self coming back - the part of him that cared about nothing but the kill. He admits not being able to keep living the lie his inverted-self has been, but he does not intend to become the monster he was, so he must become something different. He believes he needs something to fight for in order to stay grounded, and he remembers the promise he made to Monet, whom he developed feelings for. He promised to keep her curse secret and wanted to help find a cure and beat the darkness within her.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 4 #17</ref> When the team disbanded, Sabretooth went off with Monet to continue trying to help her.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' Vol. 4 #19</ref>\n\n===ResurrXion===\nAfter leaving Monet due to her becoming too evil, Creed went to live in a cabin in the woods during the \"Weapons of Mutant Destruction\" storyline.

His primary mutant power is an accelerated healing ability that allows him to regenerate damaged or destroyed areas of his body and cellular structure far beyond the capabilities of an ordinary human. Like Wolverine's, his abilities have been depicted with variable degrees of contradiction by various creators. Sabretooth's increased attributes stem, in part from said healing. This \"healing factor\" also grants him virtual immunity against most poisons, drugs, toxins, and diseases, and limited immunity to the fatigue.<ref name=\"OHOTMU vol.4 #6\">''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' vol. 4 #6</ref> The regenerative qualities of his powers cause him to age at an unusually slow rate. While he is of an unknown advanced age, Sabretooth has the appearance and vitality of a tall muscular man in his late 20s to mid 30s.\n\nThe depiction of Sabretooth's powers has changed and evolved depending on creative team, with his healing power introduced as a [[retcon]] after he became Wolverine's rival. In other, earlier appearances, Sabretooth was much more average. In a fight with Spider-man, he was incapacitated when his face was severely wounded, and did not display any accelerated healing.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol. 1 #116</ref> When Sabretooth returned, and his still prominent wounds were reopened when he was hit in the face.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol. 1 #119</ref>\n\nSabretooth possesses acute senses that are comparable to certain animals. This includes the ability to see objects with greater clarity and at much greater distances than an ordinary human.

It's even said he can see [[infrared]] and [[ultraviolet]] portions of the spectrum.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' vol. 3 #5</ref>\n\nHe possesses some degree of notable physical abilities, such as superhuman strength due to his healing factor. The exact limits of his strength are unknown, though he originally could crush an iron barbell with ease.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 1 #213</ref> His physical strength has been artificially enhanced at least twice, first was a strength enhancement from his son, Graydon.<ref>''Sabretooth: Death Hunt'' #1</ref> Then it was further enhanced after joining the latest incarnation of the Weapon X Program.<ref>''Weapon X'' vol. 2 #4</ref> His healing factor also grants him superhuman stamina, so he can push himself at peak capacity for several days before fatigue sets in.<ref name=\"OHOTMU vol.4 #6\"/> On top of this he is depicted as having retractable claws that can rend normal clothing and flesh with ease.<ref name=\"OHOTMU vol.4 #6\"/>\n\nHis agility and reflexes were both naturally above human and further artificially enhanced.

He is also an expert at hunting and tracking, even without the use of his heightened senses. Sabretooth also developed a high resistance to telepathic probing and manipulation, after an incident where his brain was skewered.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol.2 #90</ref> And even with that damage to his brain, it's been shown that Sabretooth is actually quite intelligent compared to the average person, as shown by his ability to avoid capture and escape the highest levels of incarceration without assistance. He is also highly skilled at [[psychological manipulation]], and has demonstrated the ability to speak fluent [[German language|German]].<ref>''Black Widow'' #2 (2019)</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n{{Overly detailed|section|date=December 2014|section=yes}}\n{{split section|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Age of Apocalypse and the Exiles===\nIn an alternate universe in Marvel Comics depicted in the \"[[Age of Apocalypse]]\" storyline there is a vastly different version of Sabretooth. This version of the character has the same origin as the one in the normal continuity, but has a different moral alignment. He is actually one of the X-Men and a role model for other mutants in this alternate reality. This Sabretooth was initially a villain, having been recruited by Apocalypse, but he was cast out as a traitor when he expressed moral reservations about using nuclear weapons to wipe out the world's human population. Apocalypse intended to kill Sabretooth alongside the X-Men, but was thwarted by Magneto.<ref>''X-Men Chronicles'' #1 (1995)</ref> Sabretooth came back into Apocalypse's fold and took part in a number of culls, but he eventually grew disgusted by his life and rebelled against [[Holocaust (Marvel Comics)|Holocaust]], for which he was imprisoned alongside the feral Wild Child. Instead of becoming a feral killer, like Holocaust intended, Sabretooth defeated Wild Child and became his master and protector. Together, the two escaped and joined the X-Men afterward.<ref>''X-Men: Age of Apocalypse One Shot'' #1</ref> He became a [[hero]] and an ally of Logan (Weapon X), and even [[adoption|adopted]] a young girl, [[Blink (comics)|Blink]], as his daughter. In the ''[[Exiles (comic book)|Exiles]]'' comics, he spent decades in an alternate dimension raising mutant children, attempting to teach them [[ethics]] and tolerance, without incident.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' #3</ref>\n\nAlso, this version of Sabretooth's biological son was theorized to be [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], evidenced by the statement of Mystique that she had gone to the trouble of \"finding a father with fur\" when Nightcrawler complains he is cold and, when the [[Shadow King]] possesses Mystique, the captions reveal \"one memory is more interesting then the others\" and flashes to Sabretooth taunting Nightcrawler.<ref>''X-Calibre'' #3</ref>\n\nWhen the \"Age of Apocalypse\" timeline was apparently destroyed, Sabretooth became the leader of the extra-dimensional band of characters who slide into alternate realities, known as [[Weapon X (Exiles)|Weapon X]]. For a time he was also the leader of their counterpart team, the Exiles, and remains with the team to this day. This version of Sabretooth originally had no adamantium in his skeleton (though it was later revealed that his skeleton had become laced with adamantium like Wolverine), but was still superhumanly strong and possessed a regenerative healing factor.\"<ref>''Exiles'' #05</ref>\n\nWhen Sabretooth decided to leave Weapon X, he stayed behind in a dimension to ensure that that reality's version of David Richards, the son of [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]] and [[Rachel Summers]], would not be corrupted by his virtually [[omnipotence|omnipotent]] powers. However, the boy turned evil anyway, despite Sabretooth's best efforts at raising him right.<ref>''Exiles'' vol. 2 #59</ref>\n\nWhen he was recruited by the [[Timebroker]] into the Exiles, Blink's personality became incredibly docile and subservient to Creed. Sabretooth gladly took the leadership role from Blink, a fact that [[Mimic (comics)|Mimic]] clashed with him over multiple times. He continued to assist the Exiles in the race to catch [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Proteus]]. He survived being teleported into outer space by Blink (albeit by accident). After Proteus' defeat, Sabretooth stayed with the team to help fix the multiverse.<ref>''Exiles'' vol. 2 #82</ref>\n\nLater, when the Exiles needed to defeat the [[Silver Surfer]], this version temporarily becomes a [[Herald of Galactus]]. He uses the powers he gained to maul the Silver Surfer, then after he no longer needed it he returned the [[Power Cosmic]] to [[Galactus]].<ref>''Exiles'' vol. 2 #88</ref>\n\nAt Sabretooth's request, Heather unhinges Psylocke from [[Earth-616]] to join the Exiles in [[Power Princess]]' place as she might be their only chance if Proteus ever resurfaces. However, upon arrival, she clashes with Sabretooth, thinking him to be the Earth-616 Sabretooth that nearly killed her twice. They fight for a while, but eventually Psylocke catches on to the fact that Sabretooth is not there for a fight and [[Kevin Sydney|Morph]] intervenes and makes an introduction. Surprisingly, Psylocke cannot be detected by any of Panoptichron's cameras.<ref>''Exiles'' vol. 2 #91</ref> Heather teleports Morph, Sabretooth, and Psylocke down to Earth-1720 to save the other Exiles, who are beaten or brainwashed, courtesy of this world's [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Madame Hydra]], [[Invisible Woman|Sue Storm]]. He and the other Exiles save their brainwashed friends after fighting them.<ref>''Exiles'' vol. 2 #92-94</ref> Sabretooth then returns to an empty Panoptichron. He and Psylocke have been getting closer since their fight. It was later revealed on their first mission of the Exiles with Sabretooth as the new team leader, that his skeleton was now laced with adamantium, though exactly how this happened has yet to be revealed, as he never been previously shown to have had any such enhancements.{{Issue|date=September 2009}} Sabretooth was lost along with Mystique, Valeria, Sage, Rogue, and Gambit (most of the New Exiles team) when they were immersed within the Crystal Palace.<ref>''Exiles'' vol. 2 #6</ref>\n\nApparently Blink and the new team of Exiles had found a way to reverse the process as Sabretooth has since been returned to the Age of Apocalypse, since he and Wild Child are seen following and confronting the X-Force from Earth-616.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #11</ref> After teaming with X-Force to save Archangel, most of the AoA X-Men are killed. [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] stays on Earth-616 to join X-Force while Sabretooth returns to AoA with the only other survivor, Jean Grey. There, they face off against Weapon Omega, formerly this world's Logan and Jean Grey's husband. In an attempt to recreate the [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]] with clones of the [[Scarlet Witch]],<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #19.1</ref> both Jean and Sabretooth end up powerless. They go on the run with the X-Terminated,<ref>''Age of Apocalypse'' #1</ref> and Sabretooth was injured a while later fighting Weapon Omega while saving Jean.<ref>''Age of Apocalypse'' #10</ref> In the months that followed, his son Graydon, also known as Horror Show, patched him up physically and the two made their peace. During the X-Termination crossover, AoA Nightcrawler's trip home resulted in the release of three evil beings that destroy anyone they touch. Several casualties resulted, including the AoA's Sabretooth, Horror Show, and Fiend, as well as the X-Treme X-Men's Xavier and Hercules.<ref>''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' #60 (2013)</ref>\n\n===Earth X===\nIn another alternate reality, [[Earth X]], Sabretooth was a member of a Hominid race of half-men, half-beast creatures known as the Bear Clan (along with the Wendigo spirit), who were staunch opponents of the Moon Clan, of which Wolverine was a member (along with Wild Child, Sasquatch, and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]).{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\n\n===House of M===\nIn the [[House of M]] alternate reality created by [[Scarlet Witch]], Sabretooth is a messenger/assassin sent by Magneto. He was dispatched to assassinate Graydon Creed.<ref>''Civil War: House of M'' #3</ref> Magneto sent Sabretooth to deliver a threat to Black Panther. After a short fight, Black Panther decapitates Sabretooth with a vibranium sword, then returns the head to Magneto. It is unknown as to whether or not the head was reunited with the body at a later stage, but this seems unlikely due to later events.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #7</ref>\n\n===Marvel Noir===\nIn the ''[[Wolverine Noir]]'' series, this version of Sabretooth is only known by his name, Victor Creed, who owns a hotel named \"The Puritan\" as well as a boxing club called \"Victory Boxing\" in the southeast of the [[Bowery]], which was used to get kids off the street. Logan's partner, Dog, mentioned Creed in the Puritan after he disappeared. Logan, expected by Victor, goes to the boxing club and the two fight; Victor beats him and has his body thrown into the alley, where [[Yuriko Oyama|Yuriko]]'s body was also lying.<ref>''Wolverine Noir'' #2</ref> Victor and his thugs capture Logan after he passes out outside of a bar,<ref>''Wolverine Noir'' #3</ref> taking him to the train yards where Rose and Mariko are waiting with Dog tied to the train tracks. Rose reveals that she had Victor bring Logan and Dog here so that she could get revenge on them. Dog is run over by a train during this conversation and Rose shoots Mariko in the head so she could not betray them to help Logan, which makes Logan kill her and her thugs. Victor runs off during the fight, wishing Rose \"good luck in hell\".<ref>''Wolverine Noir'' #4</ref>\n\n===Marvel Zombies===\nSabretooth, as a [[zombie]], is one of a group of zombie villains who team together to try to devour the visiting [[Galactus#Marvel Zombies|Galactus]]. They manage to hurt the cosmic being, but are thrown off their goal by zombie \"heroes\", [[Alternative versions of Wolverine#Marvel Zombies|Wolverine]] being one of them. In the course of the battle, Wolverine decapitates Sabretooth.<ref>''Marvel Zombies'' Vol. 1 #5</ref>\n\n===Mutant X===\nIn this reality, a feral Sabretooth roams the Canadian Wilderness with feral versions of Wolverine and Wild Child who help make up \"The Pack\".{{issue|date=January 2014}} Near the end of the series he breaks off from \"the Pack\" rejoining up with Weapon X to bring back Wolverine.{{issue|date=January 2014}} After kidnapping Wolverine's family Wolverine confronts him and kills him by chopping his head off.<ref>''Mutant X'' #29</ref>\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\n[[File:Ultimate universe Sabretooth.jpg|upright|thumb|The [[Ultimate Marvel]] depiction of Sabretooth]]\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel Universe]] depiction of Sabretooth is a mutant soldier and commando for Weapon X, under the direction of a man by the name of [[Kestrel (Marvel Comics)|Colonel Wraith]] who referred to him as \"a poor man's Wolverine\". He appears to be the only mutant who enlisted in the program by choice, due to his high-ranking position and his high authority in the operations. He is practically the same as the Earth-616 version of Sabretooth, having accelerated healing and keen senses, with the exception that he has four adamantium claws surgically implanted in each arm in an attempt to one-up [[Wolverine (Ultimate Marvel character)|Wolverine]] after having many failures in the service of Weapon X. One of the adamantium claws implanted in his left forearm is broken.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #12 (January 2002)</ref> Exactly how and when this occurred has not been revealed. He has a burning hatred for Wolverine and also, as he stated in his encounter with him at Weapon X, for the primitive Homo sapiens. He feels that his cruel, psychopathic nature was merely a natural part of being a mutant. When [[Ultimate Magneto|Magneto]] attempted to destroy the world so that he could eradicate humans, Sabretooth asked him to kill as few animals as possible.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #30 (May 2003)</ref>\n\nHe cruelly boasts of murdering Wolverine's wife and child, and then commenced battle with him outside the Weapon X compound. He initially had the upper hand, but Wolverine managed to score a critical hit, a stab to Sabretooth's groin, before driving him off the edge of a cliff.{{issue|date=January 2014}}\n\nFollowing Sabretooth's loss to Wolverine, the Weapon X program was dismantled with Colonel Wraith being shot dead by [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]]. Sabretooth did not die from his encounter with Wolverine, but rather returned as a high-ranking follower to Magneto in the Brotherhood of Mutants. His encounter with Wolverine while with the Brotherhood was his final underestimation of his old enemy. After boasting that he can survive any wound or injury, and would always return to fight and haunt Wolverine, Wolverine gives a vicious retort: he decapitates Sabretooth on the spot, although the panel was partially covered, so that the full effect of the injury was not visible.{{issue|date=January 2014}}\n\nSabretooth was long thought dead until he resurfaces one night when Wolverine and [[Ultimate Storm|Storm]] were leaving Nowhere Special (a [[billiard hall|pool hall]]). He is alive and well sporting a new scar around his neck, apparently from the decapitation he received from Wolverine when they last met. Sabretooth explains that his head had remained partially attached to his body via strands of tissue and blood vessels, which allowed him to survive in a comatose state while his body regenerated. He also made one startling revelation: Wolverine is his biological father. Sabretooth then attempts to obtain a tissue sample so that [[Abraham Cornelius|Dr. Cornelius]] can clone a new Wolverine. During the beginning of the \"Aftermath\" arc, Sabretooth tells Wolverine that he is Wolverine's son.{{issue|date=January 2014}} He also wants to help Wolverine search for his wife, Sabretooth's mother, although Wolverine claims that his scent proves that this is not true.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/dor/ultimate-x-men/740877/images/ultimate-x-men-20071213052440565.html Ultimate X-Men profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615081520/http://comics.ign.com/dor/ultimate-x-men/740877/images/ultimate-x-men-20071213052440565.html |date=2011-06-15 }} at IGN</ref>\n\nSabretooth made a one-panel cameo in the \"Magical\" arc, standing outside the Xavier Institute while hiding behind a tree, with a look of sorrow on his face.{{issue|date=January 2014}}\n\nIn ''[[Ultimates|Ultimates 3]]''<ref>''Ultimates 3'' #3</ref> and ''[[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum]]'', Sabretooth is shown to use his claws as weapons (like the main Marvel Universe version of Sabretooth) instead of his four adamantium claws.

The character makes many appearances throughout the course of the show, sometimes as an enemy of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and the [[X-Men]] and other times as the group's reluctant ally. It is also revealed that Sabretooth was born in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]] (although his birthplace has never truly been specified in the comics) and his name is '''[[Graydon Creed|Graydon Creed Sr.]]''' to provide less confusion as to [[Graydon Creed]]'s paternity. \n* Sabretooth appears in ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'', voiced by [[Michael Donovan]]. This version is shown as an ally of [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] and retains his hatred of Wolverine. He antagonizes Wolverine in the episodes \"The X-Impulse\" and \"Spykecam\" and helping a former Weapon X scientist to capture in the episode \"Grim Reminder\" (hinting at him and Wolverine both working for them in the past). Sabretooth appears in the two-part episode \"The Cauldron\". He again fought Wolverine on an island after Magneto's powers draw the X-Jet with [[Professor X]] inside toward [[Asteroid M]]. Wolverine, on Professor X's advice, takes a dive so that Wolverine can trace Sabretooth back to Asteroid M. Magneto uses the mutant-enhancing chamber on Sabretooth giving him a feline-like appearance. When Wolverine, [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], [[Toad (comics)|Toad]], and the remaining X-Men arrive, Sabretooth fights Wolverine and is defeated. Subsequent episodes show Sabretooth regressed back to his normal state.

Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist/co-writer [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], the character first appeared in ''[[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]'' #14 (August [[1977 in comics|1977]]). Sabretooth was originally portrayed as a non-powered [[serial killer]] but was later written as a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] possessing bestial superhuman abilities, most notably a rapid healing factor, razor-sharp fangs and claws, and superhuman senses. He is a vicious [[assassination|assassin]], responsible for numerous deaths both as a paid mercenary and for his personal pleasure. Accounts as to the origin of his enmity with Wolverine are conflicted. It is known that Wolverine and Sabretooth were participants of the [[Cold War]] [[supersoldier]] program [[Weapon X]], and that Sabretooth saw Wolverine as competition and therefore antagonized him. While Wolverine is depicted as suppressing his more savage qualities, Sabretooth does the opposite and embraces them, until the events of the 2014 storyline \"[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]\".\n\nThe character has appeared in several [[X-Men]] [[animation|animated series]] and [[video game]]s, and was portrayed by [[Tyler Mane]] in the [[X-Men (film)|first ''X-Men'' film]] and by [[Liev Schreiber]] in the 2009 film ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]''. In May 2008, [[Wizard (magazine)|''Wizard'']] magazine ranked Sabretooth #193 of the 200 best comic book characters of all time.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wizarduniverse.com/051308top200characters.html |title= The 200 Greatest Comic Book Characters of All Time |first= |last= |author= |authorlink= |date= May 13, 2008 |publisher= [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard: The Magazine of Comics, Entertainment and Pop Culture]] |trans-title=|doi= |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090616181416/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/051308top200characters.html |archivedate= June 16, 2009 |accessdate= April 19, 2011}}</ref> In 2009, Sabretooth was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 44th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/44.html Sabretooth is number 44] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104231922/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/44.html |date=2014-01-04 }}.

Sabretooth was initially conceived as a recurring antagonist for [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], whom he fights several times. He works for a time with [[Constrictor (comics)|the Constrictor]] as a partner-in-crime, and clashes repeatedly with Iron Fist and [[Luke Cage|Power Man]].<ref name=\"Power Man and Iron Fist #66\">''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #66</ref><ref name=\"Power Man and Iron Fist #84\">''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #84</ref> Sabretooth also appeared in comics such as ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]''. Chris Claremont introduced him as a minor [[X-Men]] villain, a member of [[Marauders (comics)|the Marauders]], during the \"[[Mutant Massacre]]\" crossover in 1986. He rose to greater prominence when he was split off from the Marauders and became a recurring antagonist of an individual member of the X-Men, Wolverine. Sabretooth was subsequently featured in [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] and [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] [[Comic book|comics]] including ''Sabretooth and [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]'' and ''Sabretooth: In the Red Zone'', and even had his own ongoing reprint series in the mid-1990s, ''Sabretooth Classics''.\n\n===Origin===\nChris Claremont had meant for Sabretooth to be Wolverine's father, though this was contradicted  by subsequent writers. Claremont, when asked what he had intended to be the relationship between Wolverine and Sabretooth, stated:\n\n<blockquote>Father and son. That's why Sabretooth always considered Logan \"sloppy seconds\" to his \"original\" / \"real deal.\" The other critical element in my presentation of their relationship was that, in their whole life, Logan has never defeated Sabretooth in a knock-down, drag-out, kill-or-be-killed berserker fight. By the same token, on every one of his birthdays, Sabretooth has always managed to find him, no matter where Logan was or what he was doing, and come within an inch of killing him. For no other reason than to remind him that he could.<ref name=\"x-mencomics.com\">[http://x-mencomics.com/xfan/forums/showthread.php?t=14411&page=13&pp=20] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928044912/http://x-mencomics.com/xfan/forums/showthread.php?t=14411&page=13&pp=20 |date=September 28, 2007 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[genetics|Genetic]] tests performed by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] confirmed that Sabretooth and Wolverine were not father and son.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #42</ref>\n\nAn interviewer asked [[Paul Jenkins (writer)|Paul Jenkins]] if [[Dog Logan]] was Sabretooth.

The original true Sabretooth reappears dressed in the [[Jim Lee]] costume in ''X-Men Forever'', which would make the weaker clone the one dressed in the John Byrne costume. Claremont claims he always meant for the Sabretooth dressed in the Byrne costume to be later [[outed]] as a clone of the original true Sabretooth. Claremont stated: \"Speaking specifically of the cast of ''X-Men Forever'', one character who's becoming more enticing is Sabretooth, in part because (at least as it relates to my conception of him) very little is actually known. They then filled his skeleton with adamantium. At this specific point of his life, readers haven't really seen that much of him over the years, since the Sabes that's shown up most over the time is a less-endowed copy cloned from spare cells by Mr. Sinister.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://xmennation.com/articles/latest-articles/creating-claremont-an-exclusive-interview-with-mr-chris-claremont.html| last=Lurie | first=Jordan | title=Creating Claremont - An Exclusive Interview with Mr. Chris Claremont | work=X-Men Nation | date= June 3, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Early life===\nSabretooth's real name is believed to be Victor Creed.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #5 (February 1992)</ref> Sabretooth's memories have been tampered with by clandestine organizations such as [[Weapon X]] and so much of what appears to be his past is not of credible account.<ref>Conflicting accounts in ''Origin II'', ''Origins: Sabretooth'', ''X-Men'', ''Uncanny X-Men'' in the 90s, and the 90s ''Sabretooth'' limited series</ref>{{issue|date=April 2017}} The clearest accounts of Victor's childhood begin with him murdering his brother Luther Creed over a piece of pie.<ref name=\"X-Men Origins - Sabretooth\">''X-Men Origins - Sabretooth''</ref> His father then chains him in the basement like an animal and systematically pulls out Victor's elongated canines, which perennially grow back.

Horrified by this, Clara asks Wolverine to never look for her again.

One day, Sabretooth tracks him down in Canada, and seemingly murders his one-time teammate's lover [[Silver Fox (comics)|Silver Fox]] on Logan's birthday, after Silver Fox rejects him.

He escapes, claiming only Wolverine can do what needs to be done to the psychotic Creed. Afterward, Maverick approaches the X-Men in [[Japan]], and an ancient telepath, comatose since the nuclear bomb that destroyed [[Hiroshima]], who mind-links with Creed and the team discovers Creed's psychosis was rooted in his time as a CIA operative. On a mission, he slaughtered a target, his wife (a \"frail\" for Creed), and a little boy. The look in the boy's eyes has followed Creed ever since. Ultimately, Sabretooth attacks [[Charles Xavier]], leader of the X-Men. As Xavier infiltrates Creed's mind, he discovers that every victim Sabretooth has killed is remembered by the villain. Xavier is confident this means Creed values human life, and there is hope for the mutant. Sabretooth is incarcerated, as a wanted murderer, in a holographic environment because Xavier does not want him to roam on the grounds. Sabretooth is angered, but grudgingly stays with the team. During his incarceration, he assists in battles against the [[X-Cutioner]] and the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]]. Caliban, free of Apocalypse's control, kidnaps the X-Man [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] in exchange for Sabretooth. When Sabretooth arrives, he mauls Caliban's face, and Caliban flees.{{issue|date=January 2015}} Wolverine, who had left the team after his [[adamantium]] was removed by [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], returns, and the villain escapes for a fight. This leads to Wolverine stabbing one of his claws into Sabretooth's brain.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #90</ref>\n\nThe newer, gentler Sabretooth is frequently nursed by [[X-Force]] member [[Tabitha Smith|Boomer]]; he eventually reveals that he was feigning helplessness, and attacks Boomer. Psylocke saves the young mutant's life, and she uses her psionic knife to disable him. However, this no longer works because his brain injury from Wolverine freed him from the need for \"the glow\", furthermore rendering him resistant to telepathic detection and control. Retaliating, Sabretooth nearly kills Psylocke, but he is finally confronted by the X-Men, who incapacitate him.<ref>''Sabretooth: In The Red Zone''</ref>\n\nHe is turned over to the custody of Dr. [[Valerie Cooper]], who fits him with an explosive restraining collar and forces him to participate as a member of the government-sponsored [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] team.{{issue|date=April 2012}} Creed later admits he was a \"sleeper\" agent with the mission of executing X-Factor members the government could not control.{{issue|date=April 2012}} He eventually escapes,{{issue|date=April 2012}} and returns once more to mercenary work.{{issue|date=April 2012}} Under unknown circumstances he gains adamantium skeleton and claws.<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol. 2) #126</ref> Sabretooth is captured, along with Wolverine, by Apocalypse, who forces the two to fight each other for the right to become Apocalypse's new [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Horseman]], Death.

In ''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #166, Sabretooth reveals that by means of genetic enhancement the Weapon X program has increased his strength and accelerated his healing factor. Eventually he escaped the program again and resumed working solo. However, he sometimes worked on a team, such as when he worked with several other villains to locate the [[Identity Disc]], a record of heroes' secret identities. This ended up being a ruse, though Nick Fury had the real disc.<ref>''Identity Disc'' limited series, 2004</ref>{{issue|date=April 2017}}\n\nLater, in [[Canada]], he encountered [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] and the newest [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]]. Sasquatch believes Creed may be responsible for some of the human deaths occurring there. Creed is seen setting traps and acting mysteriously. Sasquatch discovers Sabretooth is playing a twisted mind-game with the Wendigo before attempting to kill it. Sabretooth and the Wendigo fall into the [[Arctic Sea]] with Sabretooth biting the Wendigo's neck, and both are presumed dead by Sasquatch. After a fearsome battle in the arctic waters, Sabretooth emerged victorious with the hide of the Wendigo.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\nSabretooth would later attack the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]], in a revamped Brotherhood consisting of leader [[Black Tom Cassidy]], [[Mammomax]], [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]], [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]], and undercover heroes [[Nocturne (Talia Wagner)|Nocturne]] and [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]].{{issue|date=December 2012}} Wolverine claims to have killed Sabretooth, spreading him \"all over the grass\", although Black Tom's plant abilities probably contributed to Sabretooth's survival; he returns in ''X-Men: The 198 Files''.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\n===Reluctant alliance with the X-Men===\n{{Overly detailed|date=December 2014|section=yes}}\n[[File:Sabretooth xmen189.jpg|upright|thumb|Promotional art for ''X-Men'' vol. 2 #189 (September 2006).<br>Art by [[Chris Bachalo]] and Tim Townsend.]]\nIn ''X-Men'' vol. 2 #188 (August 2006), Sabretooth was spotted fleeing a mysterious group of superhumans collectively known as [[Children of the Vault|The Children]]. Their reasons for pursuing him remained unknown, but two of them\u2014[[Sangre (comics)|Sangre]] and [[Serafina (Marvel)|Serafina]]\u2014were tracking him. Sangre activated a singularity generator that annihilated most of the town and killed all its citizens, except for a little girl whom Serafina deliberately shielded from the destruction so there would be a witness to what had happened. He later encountered two more of the Children\u2014[[Aguja (comics)|Aguja]] and [[Fuego (comics)|Fuego]]. They attacked him and temporarily neutralized his healing factor, but he managed to escape regardless, only to end up at the Xavier Institute later that night seeking sanctuary.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\nIt is revealed that the Children are after Creed because he has seen them and knows who they are, while the public believed the X-Men destroyed the town. It is only when [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], the leader of the team, injected Nano-Sentinels into Sabretooth's blood that they take him along with their fight against the Children, a factor that one of the Children exploited. At one point, [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] saved his life during the battle. Sabretooth rewards him with some inside information: \"The first time you turn your back, you're dead.\" Following the incident on [[Providence (comics)|Providence]], Creed escaped the X-Men, but was hurled into the middle of the [[Pacific Ocean]] by Cable.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\nWriter [[Mike Carey (British writer)|Mike Carey]] noted he has no plans on redeeming Sabretooth, saying, \"I'm not going to try and show a heroic side to Sabretooth's nature; I\u2019m not going to [[retroactive continuity|retcon]] him so that there are reasons for his actions that make him forgivable. The things he's done are not forgivable and he can't be redeemed. I'm not making him into a hero; I'm making him into a team member and there are reasons within the first storyline as to why he ends up fighting alongside the X-Men against another enemy.

A fight soon breaks out with Wolverine tossing Sabretooth through a window. During the fight, Wolverine thinks back to the time when Sabretooth had, supposedly, killed Silver Fox. He remembers Sabretooth saying, \"''quod sum eris''\" and asks what it means. Sabretooth explains that it means \"I am what you will be.\" Wolverine loses control and calls Sabretooth insane before placing his fist against Sabretooth's throat. Creed tells him if he extracts his claws, he will rip his heart out. Wolverine replies, \"Let 'er rip\", and pops his claws into Sabretooth's throat.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #50</ref> Wolverine later regains consciousness and finds himself chained to the roof of the [[Blackbird (comics)|Blackbird]]. He quickly breaks free of the chains and is surprised to find Sabretooth piloting the jet. Wolverine breaks into the cockpit and begins choking Sabretooth with one of the chains and causes him to crash.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\nThe two emerge from the flaming wreckage and, while healing from the injuries sustained in the crash, begin fighting once again until separated by a lightning bolt, courtesy of Wolverine's former teammate and current Queen of [[Wakanda]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]].<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #51</ref> A short time later Sabretooth is chained up in the royal palace of Wakanda and complains to Wolverine, Storm, and the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]. Sabretooth snaps the chains and escapes into the jungle, with the Black Panther quickly giving chase. The Black Panther catches up to him and the two begin to fight, with Sabretooth quickly gaining the upper hand. He holds the Black Panther off the ground by the neck, preparing to strike a killing blow, when Wolverine suddenly appears and slices off Sabretooth's left hand.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #53</ref>\n\nOnce the fight between the Black Panther and Sabretooth is broken up by Wolverine, Sabretooth is brought back to the Wakandan Palace and placed in a [[vibranium]] holding cell and guarded around the clock. The battle scene between the Black Panther and Sabretooth then becomes the focus of why Wolverine was brought to the palace in the first place. It seems that amongst the bones from an elephant graveyard, there are also some unidentified skeletal remains of another offshoot of Homo sapiens called \"Lupus sapiens\". The Black Panther and Wolverine are discussing that instead of there being one evolutionary path between humans and monkeys, that there may also have been one that developed from lupines. It is believed at this point that [[Romulus (comics)|Romulus]] is the first of this race, and it is revealed that he has been the one behind [[Daken]]'s attacks, and the driving force behind the Weapon X program. After the discussion with the Black Panther, Wolverine is awakened by the stench of blood from something that has a scent similar to his and Sabretooth's and also something else. It turns out to be an enhanced [[Wild Child (comics)|Wild Child]] who has now surpassed the abilities of both Wolverine and Sabretooth, thanks to Romulus. Wild Child strikes Wolverine with poison-tipped claws and incapacitates him for two days. When Wolverine awakens, he finds Sasquatch, [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], and [[Feral (comics)|Feral]] and her sister [[Thornn]] ready to go back with him to the Weapon X complex so that they might get to the bottom of this lupine mystery.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}\n\nOnce they all arrive at the Weapon X facility, Wolverine is plagued by memories that seem to mix past and present together and all of them controlled by Romulus. Wolverine goes in alone telling the others to stay put on the plane, but they do not listen. Feral and Thornn, who were granted their lupine appearance back by Romulus, are separated and Sabretooth, reduced to his animalistic state, has gutted Feral and she is dying. Wolverine gets Feral back to the ship and finds that Thornn and Wolfsbane are in shock from the encounter, along with Sasquatch having been incapacitated by Wild Child. Once they are on their way, Wolverine goes back to the Xavier Institute and asks [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] to give him back the Muramasa sword, which he gave to Scott in case he was too out of control and needed to be put down for good. Cyclops only does this after [[Emma Frost]] reads Wolverine's mind and sees the horrors that Wolverine has been witnessing when he dreams: the horrors committed by Victor Creed throughout the years. Sword in hand, Wolverine then sets out to find and kill Sabretooth once and for all.<ref name=\"Wolverine vol. 3 #55\">''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #55</ref>\n\nAfter the events in \"Evolution\", Wolverine has been waiting for an unspecified length of time at Silver Fox's cabin in the Canadian wilderness. Sabretooth finally shows up and immediately attacks him. In the ensuing battle Wolverine cuts off Sabretooth's left arm with the [[Muramasa]]. Sabretooth, still in his animalistic state tries to re-attach his arm allowing his healing factor to kick in, but it does not work. Wolverine explains to a bewildered Creed that it is because the sword interrupts the healing factor and that he has to finally kill Sabretooth for what he's done. Managing to regain control and speak between grunts, Sabretooth tells him, \"Do it\". Wolverine then decapitates Sabretooth, finally putting an end to his long-time enemy. Logan then walks away, leaving both Creed's body and head in the snow to rot.<ref name=\"Wolverine vol. 3 #55\"/>\n\n===Hell===\nSabretooth appears to Wolverine, leashed and under the control of the [[Satan|Devil]] himself, who has claimed to have broken Victor's will.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 4 #3</ref> Victor shows defiance by striking the face of his defeated master after Wolverine uses his broken bone claws to pin Satan to a wall.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 4 #4</ref> After Wolverine has an interrupted discussion with his father, it is shown that Victor wields Satan's sword, which is being held as a symbol of who is the ruler of Hell. Wolverine fights Victor again, mentioning, as he beheads him once more, that there's no coming back when you're killed by the sword. Wolverine leaves Victor's beheaded soul lying in the pit of Hell.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 4 #5</ref>\n\n===Return===\n{{Overly detailed|date=December 2014|section=yes}}\nIt was later revealed that the Sabretooth beheaded by Logan was in fact one of several clones grown by Romulus.

Sabretooth says he'll miss an important meeting by going, and kills the Yakuza. Creed sets a trap for Logan before heading to his meeting, but it fails causing the two to battle. Their battling ends with them surrounded by Yakuza, the Hand, the new Silver Samurai and Wolverine's adopted daughter. Logan goes to save his daughter, while Victor grabs the Silver Samurai.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #300</ref> It is later revealed Creed is working with Mystique again as well as the Mind Ninjas.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #301</ref> Mystique disables Wolverine while Sabretooth heads on to the next part of his plan. He escapes with the man who hired him, Azuma Goda, to cause a war between the Hand and the Yakuza.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #302</ref> As Goda reveals his master plan of becoming a ruler of Japan by proxies, Sabretooth has his own plans. He allows Wolverine to slip in and try to kill Goda while he saves Mystique from Lord Deathstrike and makes him an offer. The three of them arrive at a meeting of the remaining leaders of the fighting factions, who are deciding the fate of Tokyo and kill them all as Sabretooth declares himself the new \"invisible\" ruler of East Asia.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #303</ref> Sabretooth later holds a party with but Wolverine crashes the party and defeats all the guests, he then tells Sabretooth \"Happy birthday, from your old pal Wolverine\".<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #304</ref>\n\nSabretooth trains Kade Kilgore in combat and tactics, with the purpose of attacking the Jean Grey School. Sabretooth tells Kilgore the best way to destroy them is to hit them in the heart, physical or metaphorical. Kilgore figures that the heart of the school is Beast (Henry McCoy). Sabretooth ambushes the latter managing to physically wound him before taking his fight to [[Abigail Brand]], Hank's girlfriend. With help from Beast, Abigail is able to blast Sabretooth away.<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #8</ref>\n\nLater while investigating the grave of Sabretooth, Wolverine finds that the body still is in it, which indicates that Sabretooth wasn't resurrected. Wolverine also discovers that it was apparently Romulus behind everything and after being beaten, he is saved by a mysterious woman with long red hair who tells him to go to the Weapon X facility, but she disappears before he gets further answers. Wolverine goes to explore the facility only to find that someone has been experimenting with Sabretooth's genetics and has cloned him, one awakens, who Wolverine recognizes by scent to be the real Sabretooth.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #310</ref> After fighting the Sabretooth clones, Wolverine encounters the mysterious woman again, claiming that she's Romulus' twin sister, Remus.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #311</ref> She reveals that the whole \"Lupine Sapiens\" story was an elaborate hoax by her brother intended to be a ruse for his real goal of creating a master race of natural mutants artificially enhanced by a new type of adamantium, using Wolverine as a template.{{issue|date=January 2015}} After tracking Romulus, Wolverine brutally attacks and incapacitates Sabretooth.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #312</ref> While Wolverine fights Romulus, Sabretooth fights with Cloak who has been investigating with wolverine.

Sabretooth turned himself over to the authorities and plans to do good by Wolverine's example when he gets out.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #9</ref>\n\nSabretooth later joins the [[Uncanny Avengers|Avengers Unity Division]] and accompanies them to the [[High Evolutionary]]'s [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]] to look for Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' Vol. 2 #1</ref> He also assists the main Avengers team in confronting the latest version of [[Ultron]].<ref>''Avengers: Rage of Ultron''</ref>\n\n===All-New, All-Different Marvel===\nAs part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Sabretooth appears as a member of Magneto's X-Men branch in order to protect mutantkind at all costs.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' Vol. 4 #1</ref> As time goes on, his inversion starts to wear down. He notes that he can feel his former self coming back - the part of him that cared about nothing but the kill. He admits not being able to keep living the lie his inverted-self has been, but he does not intend to become the monster he was, so he must become something different. He believes he needs something to fight for in order to stay grounded, and he remembers the promise he made to Monet, whom he developed feelings for. He promised to keep her curse secret and wanted to help find a cure and beat the darkness within her.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 4 #17</ref> When the team disbanded, Sabretooth went off with Monet to continue trying to help her.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' Vol. 4 #19</ref>\n\n===ResurrXion===\nAfter leaving Monet due to her becoming too evil, Creed went to live in a cabin in the woods during the \"Weapons of Mutant Destruction\" storyline.

One of them bites Sabretooth as Lady Deathstrike gets him away from the zombies. Both of them wonder where the zombies came from. As they get to their car, it suddenly explodes. Sabretooth starts running and finds that his zombie bite is not healing. Sabretooth comes across more zombies as he starts killing them with Lady Deathstrike not far behind him. Both of them take refuge in a garage.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Claws of a Killer'' #2.

His primary mutant power is an accelerated healing ability that allows him to regenerate damaged or destroyed areas of his body and cellular structure far beyond the capabilities of an ordinary human. Like Wolverine's, his abilities have been depicted with variable degrees of contradiction by various creators. Sabretooth's increased attributes stem, in part from said healing. This \"healing factor\" also grants him virtual immunity aganist most poisons, drugs, toxins, and diseases, and limited immunity to the fatigue.<ref name=\"OHOTMU vol.4 #6\">''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' vol. 4 #6</ref> The regenerative qualities of his powers cause him to age at an unusually slow rate. While he is of an unknown advanced age, Sabretooth has the appearance and vitality of a tall muscular man in his late 20s to mid 30s.\n\nThe depiction of Sabretooth's powers has changed and evolved depending on creative team, with his healing power introduced as a [[retcon]] after he became Wolverine's rival. In other, earlier appearances, Sabretooth was much more average. In a fight with Spider-man, he was incapacitated when his face was severely wounded, and did not display any accelerated healing.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol. 1 #116</ref> When Sabretooth returned, and his still prominent wounds were reopened when he was hit in the face.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol. 1 #119</ref>\n\nSabretooth possesses acute senses that are comparable to certain animals. This includes the ability to see objects with greater clarity and at much greater distances than an ordinary human. Is able to see with this same level of clarity in almost complete darkness, just like a nocturnal hunter. It's even said he can see [[infrared]] and [[ultraviolet]] portions of the spectrum.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' vol. 3 #5</ref>\n\nHe possesses some degree of notable physical abilities, such as superhuman strength due to his healing factor. The exact limits of his strength are unknown, though he originally could crush an iron barbell with ease.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 1 #213</ref> His physical strength has been artificially enhanced at least twice, first was a strength enhancement from his son, Graydon.<ref>''Sabretooth: Death Hunt'' #1</ref> Then it was further enhanced after joining the latest incarnation of the Weapon X Program.<ref>''Weapon X'' vol. 2 #4</ref> His healing factor also grants him superhuman stamina, so he can push himself at peak capacity for several days before fatigue sets in.<ref name=\"OHOTMU vol.4 #6\"/> On top of this he is depicted as having retractable claws that can rend normal clothing and flesh with ease.<ref name=\"OHOTMU vol.4 #6\"/>\n\nHis agility and reflexes were both naturally above human and further artificially enhanced. With an ability to pounce like a hunting [[Big Cat]], stalk and move quietly throughout his appearances, most human and some super powered enemies can not react to his leap before being hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wolverine.org/enemies/58-sabretooth |title=Wolverine's Enemies: Sabretooth |publisher=Wolverine.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-04}}</ref>\n\n===Skills===\nSabretooth is an excellent hand-to-hand and armed combatant, having been trained by various organizations such as the CIA, Department H's Weapon X program, the Foreigner, and [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]]. He is also an expert at hunting and tracking, even without the use of his heightened senses. Sabretooth also developed a high resistance to telepathic probing and manipulation, after an incident where his brain was skewered.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol.2 #90</ref> And even with that damage to his brain, it's been shown that Sabretooth is actually quite intelligent compared to the average person, as shown by his ability to avoid capture and escape the highest levels of incarceration without assistance. He is also highly skilled at [[psychological manipulation]], and has demonstrated the ability to speak fluent [[German language|German]].<ref>''Black Widow'' #2 (2019)</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n{{Overly detailed|section|date=December 2014|section=yes}}\n{{split section|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Age of Apocalypse and the Exiles===\nIn an alternate universe in Marvel Comics depicted in the \"[[Age of Apocalypse]]\" storyline there is a vastly different version of Sabretooth. This version of the character has the same origin as the one in the normal continuity, but has a different moral alignment. He is actually one of the X-Men and a role model for other mutants in this alternate reality. This Sabretooth was initially a villain, having been recruited by Apocalypse, but he was cast out as a traitor when he expressed moral reservations about using nuclear weapons to wipe out the world's human population. Apocalypse intended to kill Sabretooth alongside the X-Men, but was thwarted by Magneto.<ref>''X-Men Chronicles'' #1 (1995)</ref> Sabretooth came back into Apocalypse's fold and took part in a number of culls, but he eventually grew disgusted by his life and rebelled against [[Holocaust (Marvel Comics)|Holocaust]], for which he was imprisoned alongside the feral Wild Child. Instead of becoming a feral killer, like Holocaust intended, Sabretooth defeated Wild Child and became his master and protector. Together, the two escaped and joined the X-Men afterward.<ref>''X-Men: Age of Apocalypse One Shot'' #1</ref> He became a [[hero]] and an ally of Logan (Weapon X), and even [[adoption|adopted]] a young girl, [[Blink (comics)|Blink]], as his daughter. In the ''[[Exiles (comic book)|Exiles]]'' comics, he spent decades in an alternate dimension raising mutant children, attempting to teach them [[ethics]] and tolerance, without incident.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' #3</ref>\n\nAlso, this version of Sabretooth's biological son was theorized to be [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], evidenced by the statement of Mystique that she had gone to the trouble of \"finding a father with fur\" when Nightcrawler complains he is cold and, when the [[Shadow King]] possesses Mystique, the captions reveal \"one memory is more interesting then the others\" and flashes to Sabretooth taunting Nightcrawler.<ref>''X-Calibre'' #3</ref>\n\nWhen the \"Age of Apocalypse\" timeline was apparently destroyed, Sabretooth became the leader of the extra-dimensional band of characters who slide into alternate realities, known as [[Weapon X (Exiles)|Weapon X]]. For a time he was also the leader of their counterpart team, the Exiles, and remains with the team to this day.

However, the boy turned evil anyway, despite Sabretooth's best efforts at raising him right.<ref>''Exiles'' vol. 2 #59</ref>\n\nWhen he was recruited by the [[Timebroker]] into the Exiles, Blink's personality became incredibly docile and subservient to Creed. Sabretooth gladly took the leadership role from Blink, a fact that [[Mimic (comics)|Mimic]] clashed with him over multiple times. He continued to assist the Exiles in the race to catch [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Proteus]]. He survived being teleported into outer space by Blink (albeit by accident). After Proteus' defeat, Sabretooth stayed with the team to help fix the multiverse.<ref>''Exiles'' vol. 2 #82</ref>\n\nLater, when the Exiles needed to defeat the [[Silver Surfer]], this version temporarily becomes a [[Herald of Galactus]]. He uses the powers he gained to maul the Silver Surfer, then after he no longer needed it he returned the [[Power Cosmic]] to [[Galactus]].<ref>''Exiles'' vol. 2 #88</ref>\n\nAt Sabretooth's request, Heather unhinges Psylocke from [[Earth-616]] to join the Exiles in [[Power Princess]]' place as she might be their only chance if Proteus ever resurfaces. However, upon arrival, she clashes with Sabretooth, thinking him to be the Earth-616 Sabretooth that nearly killed her twice. They fight for a while, but eventually Psylocke catches on to the fact that Sabretooth is not there for a fight and [[Kevin Sydney|Morph]] intervenes and makes an introduction. Surprisingly, Psylocke cannot be detected by any of Panoptichron's cameras.<ref>''Exiles'' vol. 2 #91</ref> Heather teleports Morph, Sabretooth, and Psylocke down to Earth-1720 to save the other Exiles, who are beaten or brainwashed, courtesy of this world's [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Madame Hydra]], [[Invisible Woman|Sue Storm]]. He and the other Exiles save their brainwashed friends after fighting them.<ref>''Exiles'' vol. 2 #92-94</ref> Sabretooth then returns to an empty Panoptichron. He and Psylocke have been getting closer since their fight. It was later revealed on their first mission of the Exiles with Sabretooth as the new team leader, that his skeleton was now laced with adamantium, though exactly how this happened has yet to be revealed, as he never been previously shown to have had any such enhancements.{{Issue|date=September 2009}} Sabretooth was lost along with Mystique, Valeria, Sage, Rogue, and Gambit (most of the New Exiles team) when they were immersed within the Crystal Palace.<ref>''Exiles'' vol. 2 #6</ref>\n\nApparently Blink and the new team of Exiles had found a way to reverse the process as Sabretooth has since been returned to the Age of Apocalypse, since he and Wild Child are seen following and confronting the X-Force from Earth-616.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #11</ref> After teaming with X-Force to save Archangel, most of the AoA X-Men are killed. [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] stays on Earth-616 to join X-Force while Sabretooth returns to AoA with the only other survivor, Jean Grey.

During the X-Termination crossover, AoA Nightcrawler's trip home resulted in the release of three evil beings that destroy anyone they touch.

After a short fight, Black Panther decapitates Sabretooth with a vibranium sword, then returns the head to Magneto. It is unknown as to whether or not the head was reunited with the body at a later stage, but this seems unlikely due to later events.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #7</ref>\n\n===Marvel Noir===\nIn the ''[[Wolverine Noir]]'' series, this version of Sabretooth is only known by his name, Victor Creed, who owns a hotel named \"The Puritan\" as well as a boxing club called \"Victory Boxing\" in the southeast of the [[Bowery]], which was used to get kids off the street. Logan's partner, Dog, mentioned Creed in the Puritan after he disappeared. Logan, expected by Victor, goes to the boxing club and the two fight; Victor beats him and has his body thrown into the alley, where [[Yuriko Oyama|Yuriko]]'s body was also lying.<ref>''Wolverine Noir'' #2</ref> Victor and his thugs capture Logan after he passes out outside of a bar,<ref>''Wolverine Noir'' #3</ref> taking him to the train yards where Rose and Mariko are waiting with Dog tied to the train tracks. Rose reveals that she had Victor bring Logan and Dog here so that she could get revenge on them.

Victor runs off during the fight, wishing Rose \"good luck in hell\".<ref>''Wolverine Noir'' #4</ref>\n\n===Marvel Zombies===\nSabretooth, as a [[zombie]], is one of a group of zombie villains who team together to try to devour the visiting [[Galactus#Marvel Zombies|Galactus]]. They manage to hurt the cosmic being, but are thrown off their goal by zombie \"heroes\", [[Alternative versions of Wolverine#Marvel Zombies|Wolverine]] being one of them. In the course of the battle, Wolverine decapitates Sabretooth.<ref>''Marvel Zombies'' Vol. 1 #5</ref>\n\n===Mutant X===\nIn this reality, a feral Sabretooth roams the Canadian Wilderness with feral versions of Wolverine and Wild Child who help make up \"The Pack\".{{issue|date=January 2014}} Near the end of the series he breaks off from \"the Pack\" rejoining up with Weapon X to bring back Wolverine.{{issue|date=January 2014}} After kidnapping Wolverine's family Wolverine confronts him and kills him by chopping his head off.<ref>''Mutant X'' #29</ref>\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\n[[File:Ultimate universe Sabretooth.jpg|upright|thumb|The [[Ultimate Marvel]] depiction of Sabretooth]]\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel Universe]] depiction of Sabretooth is a mutant soldier and commando for Weapon X, under the direction of a man by the name of [[Kestrel (Marvel Comics)|Colonel Wraith]] who referred to him as \"a poor man's Wolverine\". He appears to be the only mutant who enlisted in the program by choice, due to his high-ranking position and his high authority in the operations. He is practically the same as the Earth-616 version of Sabretooth, having accelerated healing and keen senses, with the exception that he has four adamantium claws surgically implanted in each arm in an attempt to one-up [[Wolverine (Ultimate Marvel character)|Wolverine]] after having many failures in the service of Weapon X. One of the adamantium claws implanted in his left forearm is broken.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #12 (January 2002)</ref> Exactly how and when this occurred has not been revealed. He has a burning hatred for Wolverine and also, as he stated in his encounter with him at Weapon X, for the primitive Homo sapiens. He feels that his cruel, psychopathic nature was merely a natural part of being a mutant. When [[Ultimate Magneto|Magneto]] attempted to destroy the world so that he could eradicate humans, Sabretooth asked him to kill as few animals as possible.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #30 (May 2003)</ref>\n\nHe cruelly boasts of murdering Wolverine's wife and child, and then commenced battle with him outside the Weapon X compound. He initially had the upper hand, but Wolverine managed to score a critical hit, a stab to Sabretooth's groin, before driving him off the edge of a cliff.{{issue|date=January 2014}}\n\nFollowing Sabretooth's loss to Wolverine, the Weapon X program was dismantled with Colonel Wraith being shot dead by [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]]. Sabretooth did not die from his encounter with Wolverine, but rather returned as a high-ranking follower to Magneto in the Brotherhood of Mutants. His encounter with Wolverine while with the Brotherhood was his final underestimation of his old enemy. After boasting that he can survive any wound or injury, and would always return to fight and haunt Wolverine, Wolverine gives a vicious retort: he decapitates Sabretooth on the spot, although the panel was partially covered, so that the full effect of the injury was not visible.{{issue|date=January 2014}}\n\nSabretooth was long thought dead until he resurfaces one night when Wolverine and [[Ultimate Storm|Storm]] were leaving Nowhere Special (a [[billiard hall|pool hall]]). He is alive and well sporting a new scar around his neck, apparently from the decapitation he received from Wolverine when they last met. Sabretooth explains that his head had remained partially attached to his body via strands of tissue and blood vessels, which allowed him to survive in a comatose state while his body regenerated. He also made one startling revelation: Wolverine is his biological father. Sabretooth then attempts to obtain a tissue sample so that [[Abraham Cornelius|Dr. Cornelius]] can clone a new Wolverine. During the beginning of the \"Aftermath\" arc, Sabretooth tells Wolverine that he is Wolverine's son.{{issue|date=January 2014}} He also wants to help Wolverine search for his wife, Sabretooth's mother, although Wolverine claims that his scent proves that this is not true.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/dor/ultimate-x-men/740877/images/ultimate-x-men-20071213052440565.html Ultimate X-Men profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615081520/http://comics.ign.com/dor/ultimate-x-men/740877/images/ultimate-x-men-20071213052440565.html |date=2011-06-15 }} at IGN</ref>\n\nSabretooth made a one-panel cameo in the \"Magical\" arc, standing outside the Xavier Institute while hiding behind a tree, with a look of sorrow on his face.{{issue|date=January 2014}}\n\nIn ''[[Ultimates|Ultimates 3]]''<ref>''Ultimates 3'' #3</ref> and ''[[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum]]'', Sabretooth is shown to use his claws as weapons (like the main Marvel Universe version of Sabretooth) instead of his four adamantium claws.

Sabretooth appears in the two-part episode \"The Cauldron\". He again fought Wolverine on an island after Magneto's powers draw the X-Jet with [[Professor X]] inside toward [[Asteroid M]]. Wolverine, on Professor X's advice, takes a dive so that Wolverine can trace Sabretooth back to Asteroid M. Magneto uses the mutant-enhancing chamber on Sabretooth giving him a feline-like appearance. When Wolverine, [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], [[Toad (comics)|Toad]], and the remaining X-Men arrive, Sabretooth fights Wolverine and is defeated.

It gained recognition after its re-release in August 2015. It reached number one on [[Sirius XM Radio]]'s [[Alt Nation]] Alt 18 Countdown for 23 January 2016 and held that spot for three weeks. The song also reached number 16 on the U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Alternative Songs]] chart, number 45 in Japan and number 135 in France. His popularity attracted the attention of many major music labels; he eventually signed to [[Columbia Records]] in 2016.\n\nMcKenna continued to write and record music for his debut studio album during 2016. During this time, he also performed concerts and appeared at festivals. He released ''[[What Do You Think About the Car?]]'' through Columbia on 21 July 2017. Songs that appear on the album that were released as singles prior to the album\u2019s release include \"Paracetamol\", \"Isombard\" and \"The Kids Don't Wanna Come Home\", which peaked at number 84 on Belgium's [[Ultratop|Ultratop Flanders]] chart.

He initially gained recognition for winning the [[Glastonbury Festival]]'s Emerging Talent Competition in 2015. McKenna self-released the song \"Brazil\", a protest song criticising [[FIFA]] and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] held in Brazil, as his debut single in December 2014. It gained recognition after its re-release in August 2015. It reached number one on [[Sirius XM Radio]]'s [[Alt Nation]] Alt 18 Countdown for 23 January 2016 and held that spot for three weeks. The song also reached number 16 on the U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Alternative Songs]] chart, number 45 in Japan and number 135 in France. His popularity attracted the attention of many major music labels; he eventually signed to [[Columbia Records]] in 2016.\n\nMcKenna continued to write and record music for his debut studio album during 2016. During this time, he also performed concerts and appeared at festivals. He released ''[[What Do You Think About the Car?]]'' through Columbia on 21 July 2017. Songs that appear on the album that were released as singles prior to the album\u2019s release include \"Paracetamol\", \"Isombard\" and \"The Kids Don't Wanna Come Home\", which peaked at number 84 on Belgium's [[Ultratop|Ultratop Flanders]] chart. Also during 2017, he made appearances at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]] and [[Lollapalooza]] festivals.\n\n==Life and career==\n===Early life and breakout with \"Brazil\" (1998\u20132015)===\nDeclan McKenna was born in [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]], [[Greater London]],<ref>https://search.findmypast.co.uk/results/world-records/england-and-wales-births-1837-2006?firstname=declan%20&lastname=mckenna&eventyear=1998&eventyear_offset=1</ref> on 24 December 1998<ref name=\"welch\" /><ref name=smythz>{{cite news|last=Smyth|first=David|title=Declan McKenna, interview: The voice of Generation Z|work=The Evening Standard|date=6 January 2017|accessdate=6 January 2017|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/music/declan-mckenna-interview-the-voice-of-generation-z-a3434331.html}}</ref> and grew up in [[Cheshunt]], [[Hertfordshire]],<ref name=\"wilkinson\">{{cite news|title=New Music of the Day: Declan McKenna \u2013 Paracetamol|last=Wilkinson|first=Matt|date=22 November 2015|work=[[NME]]}}</ref> where he attended [[St Mary's Church of England High School]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hertfordshiremercury.co.uk/Waltham-Cross-summer-fair-provides-eclectic-entertainment-SLIDESHOW/story-21986168-detail/story.html#8|title=Waltham Cross summer fair provides eclectic entertainment: Slideshow|work=Hertfordshire Mercury|date=7 June 2014|accessdate=8 January 2016}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> He began taking his [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE]] exams in the summer of 2015.<ref name=\"welch\">{{Cite news |url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Glastonbury-Festival-competition-winner-Declan/story-28341626-detail/story.html |title=Glastonbury Festival competition winner Declan McKenna is one to watch |last=Welch |first=Andy |date=12 December 2015 |work=Bristol Post |access-date=8 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220113233/http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Glastonbury-Festival-competition-winner-Declan/story-28341626-detail/story.html |archive-date=20 December 2015}}</ref><ref name=bbc /> He later studied for his [[GCE Advanced Level (United Kingdom)|A-levels]] in English literature, Philosophy and Ethics, and Sociology, but stopped after a few months after his music career began to consume too much of his time.<ref name=smythz />\n\nIn 2015, McKenna entered the Glastonbury Festival's Emerging Talent Competition.

Although it was not likely to receive radio airplay or top out the charts, Wilkinson argued, the song showed that McKenna was not just another \"UK indie troubadour, a little bit oikish and with a nifty talent for mainstream melody\", but rather a solid and accomplished songwriter who can deliver \"bruised and vulnerable\" vocals.<ref name=wilkinson/> Jon Lyons of the music Web site
