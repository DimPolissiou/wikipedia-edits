The system is analogous to the [[pennant number]] system that the [[Royal Navy]] and other European and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] navies use.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== United States Navy ===\nThe U.S. Navy began to assign unique [[Naval Registry Identification Number]]s to its ships in the 1890s. The system was a simple one in which each ship received a number which was appended to its ship type, fully spelled out, and added parenthetically after the ship's name when deemed necessary to avoid confusion between ships. Under this system, for example, the [[battleship]] [[USS Indiana (BB-1)|''Indiana'']] was USS ''Indiana'' (Battleship No. 1), the [[cruiser]] [[USS Olympia (C-6)|''Olympia'']] was USS ''Olympia'' (Cruiser No. 6), and so on. Beginning in 1907, some ships also were referred to alternatively by single-letter or three-letter codes\u2014for example, USS ''Indiana'' (Battleship No. 1) could be referred to as USS ''Indiana'' (B-1) and USS ''Olympia'' (Cruiser No. 6) could also be referred to as USS ''Olympia'' (C-6), while USS ''Pennsylvania'' (Armored Cruiser No. 4) could be referred to as USS ''Pennsylvania'' (ACR-4). However, rather than replacing it, these codes coexisted and were used interchangeably with the older system until the modern system was instituted on 17 July 1920.<ref name=DerDigiCru1/>\n\nDuring [[World War I]], the U.S. Navy acquired large numbers of privately owned and commercial ships and craft for use as [[patrol vessel]]s, [[Minelayer|mine warfare vessels]],  and various types of naval [[auxiliary ship]]s, some of them with identical names. To keep track of them all, the Navy assigned unique identifying numbers to them. Those deemed appropriate for patrol work received [[section patrol]] numbers (SP), while those intended for other purposes received \"identification numbers\", generally abbreviated \"Id. No.\" or \"ID;\" some ships and craft changed from an SP to an ID number or vice versa during their careers, without their unique numbers themselves changing, and some ships and craft assigned numbers in anticipation of naval service never were acquired by the Navy. The SP/ID numbering sequence was unified and continuous, with no SP number repeated in the ID series or vice versa so that there could not be, for example, both an \"SP-435\" and an \"Id. No 435\". The SP and ID numbers were used parenthetically after each boat's or ship's name to identify it; although this system pre-dated the modern hull classification system and its numbers were not referred to at the time as \"hull codes\" or \"hull numbers,\" it was used in a similar manner to today's system and can be considered its precursor.<ref>Naval History and heritage Command Online Library of Selected Images (archived from [http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/shusn-no/spid-no.htm the original] at https://web.archive.org/web/20100329212007/http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/shusn-no/spid-no.htm).</ref>\n\n=== United States Revenue Cutter Service and United States Coast Guard ===\nThe [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]], which merged with the [[United States Lifesaving Service]] in January 1915 to form the modern [[United States Coast Guard]], began following the Navy's lead in the 1890s, with its [[United States Coast Guard Cutter|cutters]] having parenthetical numbers called [[Naval Registry Identification Number]]s following their names, such as (Cutter No. 1), etc.  This persisted until the Navy's modern hull classification system's introduction in 1920, which included Coast Guard ships and craft.\n\n=== United States Coast and Geodetic Survey ===\n\nLike the U.S. Navy, the [[United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]] \u2013 a uniformed seagoing service of the [[United States Government]] and a predecessor of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) \u2013 adopted a hull number system for its fleet in the 20th century. Its largest vessels, \"Category I\" [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] [[survey ship]]s, were classified as \"ocean survey ships\" and given the designation \"OSS\". Intermediate-sized \"Category II\" oceanographic survey ships received the designation \"MSS\" for \"medium survey ship,\" and smaller \"Category III\" oceanographic survey ships were given the classification \"CSS\" for \"coastal survey ship.\" A fourth designation, \"ASV\" for \"auxiliary survey vessel,\" included even smaller vessels. In each case, a particular ship received a unique designation based on its classification and a unique hull number separated by a space rather than a hyphen; for example, the third Coast and Geodetic Survey ship named ''Pioneer'' was an ocean survey ship officially known as [[USC&GS Pioneer (OSS 31)|USC&GS ''Pioneer'' (OSS 31)]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=uYSPAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA3612&lpg=PA3612&dq=Ocean+Survey+Ship+(OSS)+MSS+CSS&source=bl&ots=q0Iq2sEN7a&sig=HN4i6XsnjYb3s8LOLXrPMbSaIUg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3nBpU8XXFdHboASC64DoAg&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Ocean%20Survey%20Ship%20(OSS)%20MSS%20CSS&f=false United States Department of State, ''United States Treaties and Other International Obligations, Volume 23, Part Four'', Washington, D.C.:U.S. Government Printing Office, 1972, p. 3612.]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/cgs/011_pdf/CSC-0205.pdf |title=United States Department of Commerce, ''Annual Report of the Director of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1964'', U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C.: 1964, pp. 3\u20135. |access-date=6 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219015620/http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/cgs/011_pdf/CSC-0205.pdf |archive-date=19 February 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Coast and Geodetic Survey{{'}}s system persisted after the creation of NOAA in 1970, when NOAA took control of the Survey{{'}}s fleet, but NOAA later changed to its modern hull classification system.\n\n== The modern hull classification system ==\n\n=== United States Navy ===\n\nThe U.S. Navy instituted its modern hull classification system on 17 July 1920, doing away with section patrol numbers, \"identification numbers\", and the other numbering systems described above.  In the new system, all hull classification symbols are at least two letters; for basic types the symbol is the first letter of the type name, doubled, except for aircraft carriers.\n\nThe combination of symbol and hull number identifies a modern Navy ship uniquely. A heavily modified or re-purposed ship may receive a new symbol, and either retain the hull number or receive a new one. For example, the heavy gun cruiser {{USS|Boston|CA-69}} was converted to a gun/missile cruiser, changing the hull number to CAG-1. Also, the system of symbols has changed a number of times both since it was introduced in 1907 and since the modern system was instituted in 1920, so ships' symbols sometimes change without anything being done to the physical ship.<ref>Derdall and DiGiulian, (section: ''Nomenclature history'')</ref>\n\nHull numbers are assigned by classification. Duplication between, but not within, classifications is permitted. Hence, CV-1 was the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Langley|CV-1|6}} and BB-1 was the battleship {{USS|Indiana|BB-1|6}}.\n\nShip types and classifications have come and gone over the years, and many of the symbols listed below are not presently in use. The [[Naval Vessel Register]] maintains an online database of U.S. Navy ships showing which symbols are presently in use.\n\nAfter [[World War II]] until 1975, the U.S. Navy defined a \"[[frigate]]\" as a type of surface warship larger than a [[destroyer]] and smaller than a cruiser.  In other navies, such a ship generally was referred to as a \"[[flotilla leader]]\", or \"destroyer leader\".  Hence the U.S. Navy's use of \"DL\" for \"frigate\" prior to 1975, while \"frigates\" in other navies were smaller than destroyers and more like what the U.S. Navy termed a \"[[destroyer escort]]\", \"[[ocean escort]]\", or \"DE\".  The [[United States Navy 1975 ship reclassification]] of [[cruiser]]s, frigates, and ocean escorts brought U.S. Navy classifications into line with other nations' classifications, at least cosmetically in terms of terminology, and eliminated the perceived [[United States Navy 1975 ship reclassification#The \"cruiser gap\"|\"cruiser gap\"]] with the [[Soviet Navy]] by redesignating the former \"frigates\" as \"cruisers\".\n\n==== Military Sealift Command ====\nIf a U.S. Navy ship's hull classification symbol begins with \"T-\", it is part of the [[Military Sealift Command]], has a primarily civilian crew, and is a [[United States Naval Ship]] (USNS) in non-commissioned service \u2013 as opposed to a [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] [[United States Ship]] (USS) with an all-military crew.\n\n=== United States Coast Guard ===\nIf a ship's hull classification symbol begins with \"W\", it is a commissioned [[United States Coast Guard Cutter|cutter]] of the [[United States Coast Guard]].  Until 1965, the Coast Guard used U.S. Navy hull classification codes, prepending a \"W\" to their beginning.  In 1965, it retired some of the less mission-appropriate Navy-based classifications and developed new ones of its own, most notably WHEC for \"[[high endurance cutter]]\" and WMEC for \"[[medium endurance cutter]]\".\n\n=== National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ===\nThe [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), a component of the [[United States Department of Commerce]], includes the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps]] (or \"NOAA Corps\"), one of the eight [[uniformed services of the United States]], and operates a fleet of seagoing research and survey ships. The [[NOAA ships and aircraft|NOAA fleet]] also uses a hull classification symbol system, which it also calls \"hull numbers,\" for its ships.\n\nAfter NOAA took over the former Coast and Geodetic Survey fleet in 1970 along with research vessels of other government agencies, it adopted a new system of ship classification. In its system, the NOAA fleet is divided into two broad categories, [[research ship]]s and [[survey ship]]s.  The research ships, which include [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] and [[Fishery|fisheries]] research vessels, are given hull numbers beginning with \"R\", while the survey ships, generally [[hydrography|hydrographic]] survey vessels, receive hull numbers beginning with \"S\". The letter is followed by a three-digit number; the first digit indicates the NOAA \"class\" (i.e., size) of the vessel, which NOAA assigns based on the ship's [[gross ton]]nage and [[horsepower]], while the next two digits combine with the first digit to create a unique three-digit identifying number for the ship.\n\nGenerally, each NOAA hull number is written with a space between the letter and the three-digit number, as in, for example, {{ship|NOAAS|Nancy Foster|R 352}} or {{ship|NOAAS|Thomas Jefferson|S 222}}.<ref>Wertheim, ''The Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World, 15th Edition: Their Ships, Aircraft, and Systems'', p. 1005.</ref>\n\nUnlike the Navy, once an older NOAA ship leaves service, a newer one can be given the same hull number; for example, \"S 222\" was assigned to {{ship|NOAAS|Mount Mitchell|S 222}}, then assigned to NOAAS ''Thomas Jefferson'' (S 222), which entered NOAA service after ''Mount Mitchell'' was stricken.\n\n== United States Navy hull classification codes ==\n\nThe U.S. Navy's system of alpha-numeric ship designators, and its associated hull numbers, have been for several decades a unique method of categorizing ships of all types: combatants, auxiliaries and district craft. Though considerably changed in detail and expanded over the years, this system remains essentially the same as when formally implemented in 1920. It is a very useful tool for organizing and keeping track of naval vessels, and also provides the basis for the identification numbers painted on the bows (and frequently the sterns) of most U.S. Navy ships.\n\nThe ship designator and hull number system's roots extend back to the late 1880s, when ship type serial numbers were assigned to most of the new-construction warships of the emerging \"Steel Navy\". During the course of the next thirty years, these same numbers were combined with filing codes used by the Navy's clerks to create an informal version of the system that was put in place in 1920. Limited usage of ship numbers goes back even earlier, most notably to the \"Jeffersonian Gunboats\" of the early 1800s and the \"Tinclad\" river gunboats of the Civil War Mississippi Squadron.\n\nIt is important to understand that hull number letter prefixes are not acronyms, and should not be carelessly treated as abbreviations of ship type classifications. Thus, \"DD\" does not stand for anything more than \"Destroyer\". \"SS\" simply means \"Submarine\". And \"FF\" is the post-1975 type code for \"Frigate.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Navy Ships \u2013 Listed by Hull Number|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/shusn-no/usnsh-no.htm|publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command}}</ref>\n\nThe hull classification codes for ships in active duty in the United States Navy are governed under Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5030.8B [http://www.nvr.navy.mil/5030.8B.pdf (SECNAVINST 5030.8B).]\n\n=== Warships ===\nWarships are designed to participate in combat operations.\n\nThe origin of the two-letter code derives from the need to distinguish various cruiser subtypes.<ref name=DerDigiCru1>Derdall and DiGiulian, (section: ''Cruisers'')</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Battleship\n| Heavy gun-armed vessel\n!

Contrary to popular belief, the \"CV\" hull classification symbol does not stand for \"carrier vessel\". \"CV\" derives from the cruiser designation, with the v for French ''voler'', \"to fly\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/french-english/voler|title=English Translation of \u201cvoler\u201d {{!}} Collins French-English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2019-02-07}}</ref> Aircraft carriers are designated in two sequences: the first sequence runs from CV-1 USS ''[[USS Langley (CV-1)|Langley]]'' to the very latest ships, and the second sequence, \"CVE\" for escort carriers, ran from CVE-1 [[USS Long Island (CVE-1)|''Long Island'']] to CVE-127 [[USS Okinawa (CVE-127)|''Okinawa'']] before being discontinued.\n* AV: [[Seaplane tender]] (retired)\n* AVG: [[Auxiliary aircraft ferry]] ([[escort carrier]]) (1941\u201342)\n* AVD: [[Seaplane tender destroyer]] (retired)\n* AVP: [[Seaplane tender]], Small (retired)\n* AVT (i) Auxiliary aircraft transport (retired)\n* AVT (ii) Auxiliary training carrier (retired)\n* ACV: [[Auxiliary aircraft carrier]] (escort carrier) (1942)\n* CV: [[Fleet aircraft carrier]] (1921\u20131975), multi-purpose [[aircraft carrier]] (1975\u2013present)\n* CVA: Aircraft carrier, attack (category merged into CV, 30 June 1975)\n* CV(N): Aircraft carrier, night (deck equipped with lighting and pilots trained and for nighttime fights) (1944) (retired)\n* CVAN: Aircraft carrier, attack, nuclear-powered (category merged into CVN, 30 June 1975)\n* CVB: Aircraft carrier, large (original USS ''Midway'' class, category merged into CVA, 1952)\n* CVE: [[Escort aircraft carrier]] (retired) (1943\u2013retirement of type)\n* CVHA: Aircraft carrier, helicopter assault (retired in favor of several LH-series [[amphibious assault ship]] hull codes)\n* CVHE: Aircraft carrier, helicopter, escort (retired)\n* CVL: [[Light aircraft carrier]] or aircraft carrier, small (retired) <ref>[https://www.history.navy.mil/content/dam/nhhc/research/histories/naval-aviation/Naval%20Aviation%20News/1940/pdf/1aug43.pdf Bureau of Aeronautics, Navy Department.\"New Carrier Designations\".

The primary surface combatants are battleships, cruisers and destroyers.  Battleships are very heavily armed and armored; cruisers moderately so; destroyers and smaller warships, less so.  Before 1920, ships were called \"<type> no. X\", with the type fully pronounced.  The types were commonly abbreviated in ship lists to \"B-X\", \"C-X\", \"D-X\" et cetera\u2014for example, before 1920, {{USS|Minnesota|BB-22}} would have been called \"USS ''Minnesota'', Battleship number&nbsp;22\" orally and \"USS ''Minnesota'', B-22\" in writing.  After 1920, the ship's name would have been both written and pronounced \"USS ''Minnesota'' (BB-22)\".

SSK, retired by the USN, continues to be used colloquially and interchangeably with SS for diesel-electric attack/patrol submarines within the USN, and, more formally, by the Royal Navy and British firms such as [[Jane's Information Group]].\n* SC: Cruiser Submarine (retired)\n* SF: Fleet [[Submarine]] (retired)\n* SM: Submarine Minelayer (retired)\n* SS: Submarine, [[Attack Submarine]]<ref>[http://www.nvr.navy.mil/CLASS.HTM U.S. Navy Ship And Service Craft Classifications<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041016023831/http://www.nvr.navy.mil/class.htm |date=16 October 2004 }}</ref>\n* SSA: Submarine Auxiliary, Auxiliary/Cargo Submarine\n* SSAN: Submarine Auxiliary Nuclear, Auxiliary/Cargo Submarine, Nuclear-powered\n* SSB: Submarine Ballistic, [[Ballistic missile submarine|Ballistic Missile Submarine]]\n* SSBN: Submarine Ballistic Nuclear, [[Ballistic missile submarine|Ballistic Missile Submarine]], Nuclear-powered\n* SSC: Coastal Submarine, over 150 tons\n* SSG: Guided Missile Submarine\n* SSGN: [[Cruise missile submarine|Guided Missile Submarine]], Nuclear-powered\n* SSI: Attack Submarine (Diesel Air-Independent Propulsion)<ref>{{cite journal | last = Buff | first = Joe | authorlink = Joe Buff\n |date=June 2007 | title = Subs in the Littoral: Diesels Just Blowing Smoke? | journal = Proceedings of the Naval Institute\n | volume = 133 | issue = 6 | pages = 40\u201343 | issn = 0041-798X | url = http://www.usni.org/ | accessdate = 2007-06-13\n | quote = Diesel AIP boats are known as SSIs, differentiating them from purely diesel-electric-powered hunter-killer subs, or SSKs. }}</ref>\n* SSK: [[Hunter-killer submarine|Hunter-Killer]]/ASW Submarine (retired)<ref>[http://www.nvr.navy.mil/oldclass.htm Inactive Classification Symbols<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118095120/http://www.nvr.navy.mil/oldclass.htm |date=18 January 2012 }}</ref>\n* SSM: Midget Submarine, under 150 tons\n* [[SSN (hull classification symbol)|SSN]]: [[Attack submarine|Attack Submarine]], Nuclear-powered\n* SSNR: Special Attack Submarine <ref group=\"note\">This odd entry is not recognized by the U.S. Naval Vessel Register, and appears only in MIL-STD-2525A: ''Common Warfighting Symbology'' (15 December 1996) and later editions (MIL-STD-2525B: ''Common Warfighting Symbology'' (30 January 1999) and MIL-STD-2525C: ''Common Warfighting Symbology'' (17 November 2008)).

Such designations usually occur during periods of sudden mobilization, such as that which occurred prior to, and during, [[World War II]] or the [[Korean War]], when it was determined that a sudden temporary need arose for a ship for which there was no official Navy designation.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], for example, a number of commercial vessels were requisitioned, or acquired, by the U.S. Navy to meet the sudden requirements of war. A [[yacht]] acquired by the U.S. Navy during the start of World War II might seem desirable to the Navy whose use for the vessel might not be fully developed or explored at the time of acquisition.\n\nOn the other hand, a U.S. Navy vessel, such as the yacht in the example above, already in commission or service, might be desired, or found useful, for another need or purpose for which there is no official designation.\n* IX: Unclassified Miscellaneous Auxiliary Ship, for example yacht ''Chanco'' acquired by the U.S. Navy on 1 October 1940. It was classified as a [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]] {{USS|Kestrel|AMc-5|1}}, but instead, mainly used as a [[patrol craft]] along the [[New England]] coast. When another assignment came, and it could not be determined how to classify the vessel, it was redesignated IX-175 on 10 July 1944.\n* IXSS: Unclassified Miscellaneous Submarines, such as the {{USS|Cod|IXSS-224}}, the {{USS|Angler|IXSS-240}} and the {{USS|Croaker|IXSS-246}}.\n* YAG: Miscellaneous Auxiliary Service Craft, such as the {{USS|George Eastman|YAG-39}}, {{USS|Butternut|YAG-60}} and {{USS|Christiana|YAG-32}} which, curiously, was earlier known as {{USS|Christiana|IX-80|1}}.\n\nNumerous other U.S. Navy vessels were launched with a temporary, or nominal, designation, such as YMS or PC, since it could not be determined what they should be used for at the time of their construction. Many of these were vessels in the 150 to 200 feet length class with powerful engines, whose function could be that of a [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]], [[patrol craft]], [[submarine chaser]], [[seaplane tender]], [[tugboat]], or other. Once their destiny, or capability, was found or determined, such vessels were reclassified with their actual designation.\n\n== National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration hull codes ==\n* R: Research ships, including oceanographic and fisheries research ships\n* S: Survey ships, including hydrographic survey ships\n\nThe letter is paired with a three-digit number.

The system is analogous to the [[pennant number]] system that the [[Royal Navy]] and other European and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] navies use.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== United States Navy ===\nThe U.S. Navy began to assign unique [[Naval Registry Identification Number]]s to its ships in the 1890s. The system was a simple one in which each ship received a number which was appended to its ship type, fully spelled out, and added parenthetically after the ship's name when deemed necessary to avoid confusion between ships. Under this system, for example, the [[battleship]] [[USS Indiana (BB-1)|''Indiana'']] was USS ''Indiana'' (Battleship No. 1), the [[cruiser]] [[USS Olympia (C-6)|''Olympia'']] was USS ''Olympia'' (Cruiser No. 6), and so on. Beginning in 1907, some ships also were referred to alternatively by single-letter or three-letter codes\u2014for example, USS ''Indiana'' (Battleship No. 1) could be referred to as USS ''Indiana'' (B-1) and USS ''Olympia'' (Cruiser No. 6) could also be referred to as USS ''Olympia'' (C-6), while USS ''Pennsylvania'' (Armored Cruiser No. 4) could be referred to as USS ''Pennsylvania'' (ACR-4). However, rather than replacing it, these codes coexisted and were used interchangeably with the older system until the modern system was instituted on 17 July 1920.<ref name=DerDigiCru1/>\n\nDuring [[World War I]], the U.S. Navy acquired large numbers of privately owned and commercial ships and craft for use as [[patrol vessel]]s, [[Minelayer|mine warfare vessels]],  and various types of naval [[auxiliary ship]]s, some of them with identical names. To keep track of them all, the Navy assigned unique identifying numbers to them. Those deemed appropriate for patrol work received [[section patrol]] numbers (SP), while those intended for other purposes received \"identification numbers\", generally abbreviated \"Id. No.\" or \"ID;\" some ships and craft changed from an SP to an ID number or vice versa during their careers, without their unique numbers themselves changing, and some ships and craft assigned numbers in anticipation of naval service never were acquired by the Navy. The SP/ID numbering sequence was unified and continuous, with no SP number repeated in the ID series or vice versa so that there could not be, for example, both an \"SP-435\" and an \"Id. No 435\". The SP and ID numbers were used parenthetically after each boat's or ship's name to identify it; although this system pre-dated the modern hull classification system and its numbers were not referred to at the time as \"hull codes\" or \"hull numbers,\" it was used in a similar manner to today's system and can be considered its precursor.<ref>Naval History and heritage Command Online Library of Selected Images (archived from [http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/shusn-no/spid-no.htm the original] at https://web.archive.org/web/20100329212007/http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/shusn-no/spid-no.htm).</ref>\n\n=== United States Revenue Cutter Service and United States Coast Guard ===\nThe [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]], which merged with the [[United States Lifesaving Service]] in January 1915 to form the modern [[United States Coast Guard]], began following the Navy's lead in the 1890s, with its [[United States Coast Guard Cutter|cutters]] having parenthetical numbers called [[Naval Registry Identification Number]]s following their names, such as (Cutter No. 1), etc.  This persisted until the Navy's modern hull classification system's introduction in 1920, which included Coast Guard ships and craft.\n\n=== United States Coast and Geodetic Survey ===\n\nLike the U.S. Navy, the [[United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]] \u2013 a uniformed seagoing service of the [[United States Government]] and a predecessor of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) \u2013 adopted a hull number system for its fleet in the 20th century. Its largest vessels, \"Category I\" [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] [[survey ship]]s, were classified as \"ocean survey ships\" and given the designation \"OSS\". Intermediate-sized \"Category II\" oceanographic survey ships received the designation \"MSS\" for \"medium survey ship,\" and smaller \"Category III\" oceanographic survey ships were given the classification \"CSS\" for \"coastal survey ship.\" A fourth designation, \"ASV\" for \"auxiliary survey vessel,\" included even smaller vessels. In each case, a particular ship received a unique designation based on its classification and a unique hull number separated by a space rather than a hyphen; for example, the third Coast and Geodetic Survey ship named ''Pioneer'' was an ocean survey ship officially known as [[USC&GS Pioneer (OSS 31)|USC&GS ''Pioneer'' (OSS 31)]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=uYSPAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA3612&lpg=PA3612&dq=Ocean+Survey+Ship+(OSS)+MSS+CSS&source=bl&ots=q0Iq2sEN7a&sig=HN4i6XsnjYb3s8LOLXrPMbSaIUg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3nBpU8XXFdHboASC64DoAg&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Ocean%20Survey%20Ship%20(OSS)%20MSS%20CSS&f=false United States Department of State, ''United States Treaties and Other International Obligations, Volume 23, Part Four'', Washington, D.C.:U.S. Government Printing Office, 1972, p. 3612.]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/cgs/011_pdf/CSC-0205.pdf |title=United States Department of Commerce, ''Annual Report of the Director of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1964'', U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C.: 1964, pp. 3\u20135. |access-date=6 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219015620/http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/cgs/011_pdf/CSC-0205.pdf |archive-date=19 February 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Coast and Geodetic Survey{{'}}s system persisted after the creation of NOAA in 1970, when NOAA took control of the Survey{{'}}s fleet, but NOAA later changed to its modern hull classification system.\n\n== The modern hull classification system ==\n\n=== United States Navy ===\n\nThe U.S. Navy instituted its modern hull classification system on 17 July 1920, doing away with section patrol numbers, \"identification numbers\", and the other numbering systems described above.  In the new system, all hull classification symbols are at least two letters; for basic types the symbol is the first letter of the type name, doubled, except for aircraft carriers.\n\nThe combination of symbol and hull number identifies a modern Navy ship uniquely. A heavily modified or re-purposed ship may receive a new symbol, and either retain the hull number or receive a new one. For example, the heavy gun cruiser {{USS|Boston|CA-69}} was converted to a gun/missile cruiser, changing the hull number to CAG-1. Also, the system of symbols has changed a number of times both since it was introduced in 1907 and since the modern system was instituted in 1920, so ships' symbols sometimes change without anything being done to the physical ship.<ref>Derdall and DiGiulian, (section: ''Nomenclature history'')</ref>\n\nHull numbers are assigned by classification. Duplication between, but not within, classifications is permitted. Hence, CV-1 was the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Langley|CV-1|6}} and BB-1 was the battleship {{USS|Indiana|BB-1|6}}.\n\nShip types and classifications have come and gone over the years, and many of the symbols listed below are not presently in use. The [[Naval Vessel Register]] maintains an online database of U.S. Navy ships showing which symbols are presently in use.\n\nAfter [[World War II]] until 1975, the U.S. Navy defined a \"[[frigate]]\" as a type of surface warship larger than a [[destroyer]] and smaller than a cruiser.  In other navies, such a ship generally was referred to as a \"[[flotilla leader]]\", or \"destroyer leader\".  Hence the U.S. Navy's use of \"DL\" for \"frigate\" prior to 1975, while \"frigates\" in other navies were smaller than destroyers and more like what the U.S. Navy termed a \"[[destroyer escort]]\", \"[[ocean escort]]\", or \"DE\".  The [[United States Navy 1975 ship reclassification]] of [[cruiser]]s, frigates, and ocean escorts brought U.S. Navy classifications into line with other nations' classifications, at least cosmetically in terms of terminology, and eliminated the perceived [[United States Navy 1975 ship reclassification#The \"cruiser gap\"|\"cruiser gap\"]] with the [[Soviet Navy]] by redesignating the former \"frigates\" as \"cruisers\".\n\n==== Military Sealift Command ====\nIf a U.S. Navy ship's hull classification symbol begins with \"T-\", it is part of the [[Military Sealift Command]], has a primarily civilian crew, and is a [[United States Naval Ship]] (USNS) in non-commissioned service \u2013 as opposed to a [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] [[United States Ship]] (USS) with an all-military crew.\n\n=== United States Coast Guard ===\nIf a ship's hull classification symbol begins with \"W\", it is a commissioned [[United States Coast Guard Cutter|cutter]] of the [[United States Coast Guard]].  Until 1965, the Coast Guard used U.S. Navy hull classification codes, prepending a \"W\" to their beginning.  In 1965, it retired some of the less mission-appropriate Navy-based classifications and developed new ones of its own, most notably WHEC for \"[[high endurance cutter]]\" and WMEC for \"[[medium endurance cutter]]\".\n\n=== National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ===\nThe [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), a component of the [[United States Department of Commerce]], includes the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps]] (or \"NOAA Corps\"), one of the eight [[uniformed services of the United States]], and operates a fleet of seagoing research and survey ships. The [[NOAA ships and aircraft|NOAA fleet]] also uses a hull classification symbol system, which it also calls \"hull numbers,\" for its ships.\n\nAfter NOAA took over the former Coast and Geodetic Survey fleet in 1970 along with research vessels of other government agencies, it adopted a new system of ship classification. In its system, the NOAA fleet is divided into two broad categories, [[research ship]]s and [[survey ship]]s.  The research ships, which include [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] and [[Fishery|fisheries]] research vessels, are given hull numbers beginning with \"R\", while the survey ships, generally [[hydrography|hydrographic]] survey vessels, receive hull numbers beginning with \"S\". The letter is followed by a three-digit number; the first digit indicates the NOAA \"class\" (i.e., size) of the vessel, which NOAA assigns based on the ship's [[gross ton]]nage and [[horsepower]], while the next two digits combine with the first digit to create a unique three-digit identifying number for the ship.\n\nGenerally, each NOAA hull number is written with a space between the letter and the three-digit number, as in, for example, {{ship|NOAAS|Nancy Foster|R 352}} or {{ship|NOAAS|Thomas Jefferson|S 222}}.<ref>Wertheim, ''The Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World, 15th Edition: Their Ships, Aircraft, and Systems'', p. 1005.</ref>\n\nUnlike the Navy, once an older NOAA ship leaves service, a newer one can be given the same hull number; for example, \"S 222\" was assigned to {{ship|NOAAS|Mount Mitchell|S 222}}, then assigned to NOAAS ''Thomas Jefferson'' (S 222), which entered NOAA service after ''Mount Mitchell'' was stricken.\n\n== United States Navy hull classification codes ==\n\nThe U.S. Navy's system of alpha-numeric ship designators, and its associated hull numbers, have been for several decades a unique method of categorizing ships of all types: combatants, auxiliaries and district craft. Though considerably changed in detail and expanded over the years, this system remains essentially the same as when formally implemented in 1920. It is a very useful tool for organizing and keeping track of naval vessels, and also provides the basis for the identification numbers painted on the bows (and frequently the sterns) of most U.S. Navy ships.\n\nThe ship designator and hull number system's roots extend back to the late 1880s, when ship type serial numbers were assigned to most of the new-construction warships of the emerging \"Steel Navy\". During the course of the next thirty years, these same numbers were combined with filing codes used by the Navy's clerks to create an informal version of the system that was put in place in 1920. Limited usage of ship numbers goes back even earlier, most notably to the \"Jeffersonian Gunboats\" of the early 1800s and the \"Tinclad\" river gunboats of the Civil War Mississippi Squadron.\n\nIt is important to understand that hull number letter prefixes are not acronyms, and should not be carelessly treated as abbreviations of ship type classifications. Thus, \"DD\" does not stand for anything more than \"Destroyer\". \"SS\" simply means \"Submarine\". And \"FF\" is the post-1975 type code for \"Frigate.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Navy Ships \u2013 Listed by Hull Number|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/shusn-no/usnsh-no.htm|publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command}}</ref>\n\nThe hull classification codes for ships in active duty in the United States Navy are governed under Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5030.8B [http://www.nvr.navy.mil/5030.8B.pdf (SECNAVINST 5030.8B).]\n\n=== Warships ===\nWarships are designed to participate in combat operations.\n\nThe origin of the two-letter code derives from the need to distinguish various cruiser subtypes.<ref name=DerDigiCru1>Derdall and DiGiulian, (section: ''Cruisers'')</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Battleship\n| Heavy gun-armed vessel\n!

Contrary to popular belief, the \"CV\" hull classification symbol does not stand for \"carrier vessel\". \"CV\" derives from the cruiser designation, with the v for French ''voler'', \"to fly\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/french-english/voler|title=English Translation of \u201cvoler\u201d {{!}} Collins French-English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2019-02-07}}</ref> Aircraft carriers are designated in two sequences: the first sequence runs from CV-1 USS ''[[USS Langley (CV-1)|Langley]]'' to the very latest ships, and the second sequence, \"CVE\" for escort carriers, ran from CVE-1 [[USS Long Island (CVE-1)|''Long Island'']] to CVE-127 [[USS Okinawa (CVE-127)|''Okinawa'']] before being discontinued.\n* AV: [[Seaplane tender]] (retired)\n* AVG: [[Auxiliary aircraft ferry]] ([[escort carrier]]) (1941\u201342)\n* AVD: [[Seaplane tender destroyer]] (retired)\n* AVP: [[Seaplane tender]], Small (retired)\n* AVT (i) Auxiliary aircraft transport (retired)\n* AVT (ii) Auxiliary training carrier (retired)\n* ACV: [[Auxiliary aircraft carrier]] (escort carrier) (1942)\n* CV: [[Fleet aircraft carrier]] (1921\u20131975), multi-purpose [[aircraft carrier]] (1975\u2013present)\n* CVA: Aircraft carrier, attack (category merged into CV, 30 June 1975)\n* CV(N): Aircraft carrier, night (deck equipped with lighting and pilots trained and for nighttime fights) (1944) (retired)\n* CVAN: Aircraft carrier, attack, nuclear-powered (category merged into CVN, 30 June 1975)\n* CVB: Aircraft carrier, large (original USS ''Midway'' class, category merged into CVA, 1952)\n* CVE: [[Escort aircraft carrier]] (retired) (1943\u2013retirement of type)\n* CVHA: Aircraft carrier, helicopter assault (retired in favor of several LH-series [[amphibious assault ship]] hull codes)\n* CVHE: Aircraft carrier, helicopter, escort (retired)\n* CVL: [[Light aircraft carrier]] or aircraft carrier, small (retired) <ref>[https://www.history.navy.mil/content/dam/nhhc/research/histories/naval-aviation/Naval%20Aviation%20News/1940/pdf/1aug43.pdf Bureau of Aeronautics, Navy Department.\"New Carrier Designations\".

The primary surface combatants are battleships, cruisers and destroyers.  Battleships are very heavily armed and armored; cruisers moderately so; destroyers and smaller warships, less so.  Before 1920, ships were called \"<type> no. X\", with the type fully pronounced.  The types were commonly abbreviated in ship lists to \"B-X\", \"C-X\", \"D-X\" et cetera\u2014for example, before 1920, {{USS|Minnesota|BB-22}} would have been called \"USS ''Minnesota'', Battleship number&nbsp;22\" orally and \"USS ''Minnesota'', B-22\" in writing.  After 1920, the ship's name would have been both written and pronounced \"USS ''Minnesota'' (BB-22)\".

SSK, retired by the USN, continues to be used colloquially and interchangeably with SS for diesel-electric attack/patrol submarines within the USN, and, more formally, by the Royal Navy and British firms such as [[Jane's Information Group]].\n* SC: Cruiser Submarine (retired)\n* SF: Fleet [[Submarine]] (retired)\n* SM: Submarine Minelayer (retired)\n* SS: Submarine, [[Attack Submarine]]<ref>[http://www.nvr.navy.mil/CLASS.HTM U.S. Navy Ship And Service Craft Classifications<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041016023831/http://www.nvr.navy.mil/class.htm |date=16 October 2004 }}</ref>\n* SSA: Submarine Auxiliary, Auxiliary/Cargo Submarine\n* SSAN: Submarine Auxiliary Nuclear, Auxiliary/Cargo Submarine, Nuclear-powered\n* SSB: Submarine Ballistic, [[Ballistic missile submarine|Ballistic Missile Submarine]]\n* SSBN: Submarine Ballistic Nuclear, [[Ballistic missile submarine|Ballistic Missile Submarine]], Nuclear-powered\n* SSC: Coastal Submarine, over 150 tons\n* SSG: Guided Missile Submarine\n* SSGN: [[Cruise missile submarine|Guided Missile Submarine]], Nuclear-powered\n* SSI: Attack Submarine (Diesel Air-Independent Propulsion)<ref>{{cite journal | last = Buff | first = Joe | authorlink = Joe Buff\n |date=June 2007 | title = Subs in the Littoral: Diesels Just Blowing Smoke? | journal = Proceedings of the Naval Institute\n | volume = 133 | issue = 6 | pages = 40\u201343 | issn = 0041-798X | url = http://www.usni.org/ | accessdate = 2007-06-13\n | quote = Diesel AIP boats are known as SSIs, differentiating them from purely diesel-electric-powered hunter-killer subs, or SSKs. }}</ref>\n* SSK: [[Hunter-killer submarine|Hunter-Killer]]/ASW Submarine (retired)<ref>[http://www.nvr.navy.mil/oldclass.htm Inactive Classification Symbols<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118095120/http://www.nvr.navy.mil/oldclass.htm |date=18 January 2012 }}</ref>\n* SSM: Midget Submarine, under 150 tons\n* [[SSN (hull classification symbol)|SSN]]: [[Attack submarine|Attack Submarine]], Nuclear-powered\n* SSNR: Special Attack Submarine <ref group=\"note\">This odd entry is not recognized by the U.S. Naval Vessel Register, and appears only in MIL-STD-2525A: ''Common Warfighting Symbology'' (15 December 1996) and later editions (MIL-STD-2525B: ''Common Warfighting Symbology'' (30 January 1999) and MIL-STD-2525C: ''Common Warfighting Symbology'' (17 November 2008)).

Such designations usually occur during periods of sudden mobilization, such as that which occurred prior to, and during, [[World War II]] or the [[Korean War]], when it was determined that a sudden temporary need arose for a ship for which there was no official Navy designation.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], for example, a number of commercial vessels were requisitioned, or acquired, by the U.S. Navy to meet the sudden requirements of war. A [[yacht]] acquired by the U.S. Navy during the start of World War II might seem desirable to the Navy whose use for the vessel might not be fully developed or explored at the time of acquisition.\n\nOn the other hand, a U.S. Navy vessel, such as the yacht in the example above, already in commission or service, might be desired, or found useful, for another need or purpose for which there is no official designation.\n* IX: Unclassified Miscellaneous Auxiliary Ship, for example yacht ''Chanco'' acquired by the U.S. Navy on 1 October 1940. It was classified as a [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]] {{USS|Kestrel|AMc-5|1}}, but instead, mainly used as a [[patrol craft]] along the [[New England]] coast. When another assignment came, and it could not be determined how to classify the vessel, it was redesignated IX-175 on 10 July 1944.\n* IXSS: Unclassified Miscellaneous Submarines, such as the {{USS|Cod|IXSS-224}}, the {{USS|Angler|IXSS-240}} and the {{USS|Croaker|IXSS-246}}.\n* YAG: Miscellaneous Auxiliary Service Craft, such as the {{USS|George Eastman|YAG-39}}, {{USS|Butternut|YAG-60}} and {{USS|Christiana|YAG-32}} which, curiously, was earlier known as {{USS|Christiana|IX-80|1}}.\n\nNumerous other U.S. Navy vessels were launched with a temporary, or nominal, designation, such as YMS or PC, since it could not be determined, at time of construction, what they should be used for. Many of these were vessels in the 150 to 200 feet length class with powerful engines, whose function could be that of a [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]], [[patrol craft]], [[submarine chaser]], [[seaplane tender]], [[tugboat]], or other. Once their destiny, or capability, was found or determined, such vessels were reclassified with their actual designation.\n\n== National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration hull codes ==\n* R: Research ships, including oceanographic and fisheries research ships\n* S: Survey ships, including hydrographic survey ships\n\nThe letter is paired with a three-digit number.

They are already on the infobox.--> is the [[head of state]] of the [[People's Republic of China]]. Under the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|country's constitution]], the presidency is a largely [[Figurehead|ceremonial office]] with limited power. However, since 1993, as a matter of convention, the presidency has been held simultaneously by the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary of the Communist Party of China]], the [[Paramount leader|top leader]] in the [[One-party state|one party system]]. The presidency is officially regarded as [[Government of the People's Republic of China|an institution of the state]] rather than an administrative post; theoretically, the president serves at the pleasure of the Man with a girlfriend named Mitchell Korb [[National People's Congress]], the legislature, and is not legally vested to take executive action on its own prerogative.{{NoteTag|It is listed as such in the current Constitution; it is thus equivalent to organs such as the State Council, rather than to offices such as that of the Premier.}} The current president is [[Xi Jinping]], who took office in March 2013.\n\nSince 1993, apart from brief periods of transition, the top leader of China simultaneously serves as the president, the [[Leader of the Communist Party of China|leader of the party]] (as [[General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party|General Secretary]]), and the [[Supreme Military Command of the People's Republic of China|commander-in-chief]] of the military (as the [[chairman of the Central Military Commission]]). This individual then carries out different duties under separate titles. For example, the leader meets foreign dignitaries and receives ambassadors in his capacity as President, issues military directives as Chairman of [[Central Military Commission (China)|the Central Military Commission]], and upholds party rule as the general secretary of [[Communist Party of China|the Communist Party of China]].\n\nThe presidency was first established in the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]] in 1954 and successively held by [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Liu Shaoqi]]. Liu fell into political disgrace during the [[Cultural Revolution]], after which the presidency became vacant. The presidency was abolished under the Constitution of 1975, then reinstated in the Constitution of 1982, but with reduced powers. The official English-language [[translation]] of the title was \"[[Chairman]]\"; after 1982, this translation was changed to \"[[President (government title)|President]]\", although the Chinese title remains unchanged.{{NoteTag|In [[Chinese language|Chinese]] the President of the PRC is termed ''zh\u01d4x\u00ed'' while the Presidents of other countries are termed ''z\u01d2ngt\u01d2ng''. Furthermore ''zh\u01d4x\u00ed'' continues to have the meaning of \"chairman\" in a generic context.}}\n\nBetween 1982 and 2018, the constitution stipulated that the president could not serve more than two consecutive terms. During the Mao era and also since 2018, there were no term limits attached to this office.\n\n== Qualifications and election ==\nAccording to the current [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]], the president must be a Chinese citizen with full electoral rights who has reached the age of 45.\n\nThe president is elected by the [[National People's Congress]] (NPC), China's highest state body, which also has the power to remove the president and other state officers from office. Elections and removals are decided by a simple majority vote.<ref>[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/constitution/constitution.html Constitution of the People's Republic of China] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812224210/http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/constitution/constitution.html |date=12 August 2010 }}, Articles 62, 63.</ref>\n\nAccording to the Organic Law of the NPC, the president is nominated by the NPC [[Presidium of the National People's Congress|Presidium]], the Congress's executive organ.<ref>{{Cite web |title = Organic Law of the National People's Congress of the PRC |accessdate = 2013-07-03 |url = http://www.china.org.cn/english/government/207281.htm |archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/6a1t4WswJ?url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/government/207281.htm |archive-date = 15 July 2015 |url-status = live }}, Article 13.</ref> In practice, however, the ruling [[Communist Party of China]] reserves the post of president for its current [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]].

In addition, the president names and dismisses ambassadors to foreign countries, signs and annuls treaties with foreign entities. According to the Constitution, all of these powers require the approval or confirmation of the [[National People's Congress]]. The president also conducts state visits on behalf of the People's Republic. Under the constitution the \"state visit\" clause is the only presidential power that does not stipulate any form of oversight from the National People's Congress. As the vast majority of presidential powers are dependent on the ratification of the NPC, the president is, in essence, a symbolic post without any direct say in the governance of state.  It is therefore conceived to mainly function as an symbolic institution of the state rather than an office with true executive powers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/10/world/asia/china-xi-jinping-term-limit-explainer.html|title=Ending Term Limits for China\u2019s Xi Is a Big Deal.

Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] had a personal [[Ilyushin Il-18]] which he used on his visits. After he died, the aircraft was withdrawn from service and preserved at an aviation museum in China. In the 1970s, the position of Chinese president was abolished, but [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Hua Guofeng]] were [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China]] successively. With the introduction of the Boeing 747, officials started using the CAAC [[Boeing 747SP]] for international trips. After the CAAC was split up into six in 1988, the 747s were handed over to Air China, and officials continued using 747SPs under the CA livery. \n\nWhen [[Jiang Zemin]] came into power in 1989, the 747SPs were permanently returned to passenger service, and 747-400s were utilized. They were used throughout the use of Zemin, [[Hu Jintao]] and [[Xi Jinping]]. The 747-400s originally belong to Air China, but one month before the president goes on an official trip, the chosen plane is specifically inspected and retrofitted for VIP use. After the president returns to Beijing, the 747-400 is inspected and converted back to passenger configurations. \n\nIn the 2010s a [[Boeing 747-8]] painted in the CA livery was seen around the world, under the fake rego B-2479 and the real rego B-2485. Rumours spread, saying this would be China's new Air Force One. In 2016 it was seen landing in Hamburg for VIP configuration, and since then, it has been on loan to the Chinese Government from Air China for use by the president. Although no official photos have been released, the inside is thought to have a far more lavish interior, including conference tables, seating for the press, private bedrooms, and other features. \n\nAfter the 747-8 was introduced, the 747-400s now carry ministers and serve as decoy aircraft. On some occasions, an Air China Boeing 737 has even been used for transport. In the late 2010s, the president started importing his own presidential car on foreign trips. For this reason, an Air China Boeing 747 cargo aircraft is used for transportation of freight. \n\nIn order not to confuse air traffic control between a normal CA flight and a flight carrying a Chinese government member, all aircraft carrying government people fly under the callsign CA1 to CA100, since normal CA flights fly under the callsign CA101 and above.\n\n== Political ranking ==\n{{Main|Orders of precedence in the People's Republic of China}}\n\nFor President [[Liu Shaoqi]], he was also the first [[Vice Chairman of the Communist Party of China|vice chairman of the Communist Party of China]], ranked second in the [[Communist Party of China]], behind Chairman [[Mao Zedong]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mathews|first1=Jay|title=5 Children of Liu Shaoqi Detail Years in Disfavor|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/03/04/5-children-of-liu-shaoqi-detail-years-in-disfavor/024ff499-48af-4c41-b47c-fd7e0031bf75/|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=Washington Post|date=4 March 1980|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429154152/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/03/04/5-children-of-liu-shaoqi-detail-years-in-disfavor/024ff499-48af-4c41-b47c-fd7e0031bf75/|archive-date=29 April 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> For President [[Li Xiannian]], he was also the 5th ranked member of the [[Politburo Standing Committee]], after CPC general secretary and premier.<ref>{{cite news|title=Li Xiannian: China's new president|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/06/18/Personality-SpotlightNEWLNLi-Xiannian-Chinas-new-president/5105424756800/|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=[[United Press International|UPI]]|date=18 June 1983|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312205229/https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/06/18/Personality-SpotlightNEWLNLi-Xiannian-Chinas-new-president/5105424756800/|archive-date=12 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> For President [[Yang Shangkun]], he was not a member of Politburo Standing Committee, but he ranked third after General Secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] and [[Deng Xiaoping]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Del Vecchio|first1=Mark S.|title=Yang Shangkun elected Chinese president|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1988/04/08/Yang-Shangkun-elected-Chinese-president/9536576475200/|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=UPI|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312205223/https://www.upi.com/Archives/1988/04/08/Yang-Shangkun-elected-Chinese-president/9536576475200/|archive-date=12 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Since [[Jiang Zemin]], the president is also the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary of the Communist Party of China]], ranking first in party and state.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jiang Zemin to have lower rank in Communist party|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/9823478/Jiang-Zemin-to-have-lower-rank-in-Communist-party.html|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312234448/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/9823478/Jiang-Zemin-to-have-lower-rank-in-Communist-party.html|archive-date=12 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Establishment in 1954 ===\nThe office of State Chairman (the original English translation, as noted above) was first established under the 1954 Constitution. The ceremonial powers of the office were largely identical to those in the current Constitution.<ref>[http://e-chaupak.net/database/chicon/1954/1954bilingual.htm Constitution of the People's Republic of China, 1954] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140601163025/http://e-chaupak.net/database/chicon/1954/1954bilingual.htm |date=1 June 2014 }}, Articles 40\u201342.</ref>\n\nThe powers of the 1954 office differed from those of the current office in two areas: military and governmental. The state chairman's military powers were defined in the 1954 Constitution as follows: \"The Chairman of the People's Republic of China commands the armed forces of the state, and is Chairman of the National Defence Council ({{zh|\u56fd\u9632\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a}}).\"<ref>[http://e-chaupak.net/database/chicon/1954/1954bilingual.htm Constitution of the People's Republic of China] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140601163025/http://e-chaupak.net/database/chicon/1954/1954bilingual.htm |date=1 June 2014 }}, Article 43.</ref> The National Defence Council was unique to the 1954 Constitution, and was mandated as the civil command for the [[People's Liberation Army]].  It was abolished under the 1975 Constitution.\n\nThe state chairman's governmental powers were defined in the 1954 Constitution as follows: \"The Chairman of the People's Republic of China, whenever necessary, convenes a Supreme State Conference ({{zh|\u6700\u9ad8\u56fd\u52a1\u4f1a\u8bae}}) and acts as its chairman.\"  The members of the Supreme State Conference included the main officers of state, and its views were to be presented to the main organs of state and government, including the National People's Congress and the State and National Defense Councils.<ref>[http://e-chaupak.net/database/chicon/1954/1954bilingual.htm Constitution of the People's Republic of China] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140601163025/http://e-chaupak.net/database/chicon/1954/1954bilingual.htm |date=1 June 2014 }}, Article 44.</ref> The Supreme State Conference was also unique to the 1954 Constitution. It was abolished under the 1975 Constitution and later Constitutions have not included a similar body.\n\n=== History up to 1974 ===\n[[Mao Zedong]] was the first to hold the office of State Chairman. He was elected at the founding session of the National People's Congress in 1955. At the 2nd NPC in 1959, Mao was succeeded by [[Liu Shaoqi]], first [[Vice Chairman of the Communist Party of China|vice chairman of the Communist Party]]. Liu was reelected as State Chairman at the 3rd NPC in Jan 1965. However, in 1966, Mao launched the [[Cultural Revolution]] and by August 1966 Mao and his supporters succeeding in removing Liu from his position as party vice chairman. A few months later Liu was apparently placed under house arrest, and after a prolonged power struggle the 12th Plenum of the 8th Communist Party Congress stripped Liu Shaoqi of all his party and non-party positions on 31 October 1968, including the post of State Chairman.  This was in violation of the Constitution, which required a vote by the NPC to remove the state chairman.{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\nAfter Liu's removal in 1968, the office of State Chairman was vacant. From 1972 to 1975, however, state media referred to Vice State Chairman [[Dong Biwu]] as \"acting state chairman.\"{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\n=== Abolition in 1975 ===\nWhen the 4th NPC was convened in 1975, its main act was to adopt a new Constitution which eliminated the office of State Chairman and emphasized instead the leadership of the Communist Party over the state, including an article that made the party chairman [[Supreme Military Command of the People's Republic of China|Supreme Commander]] of the [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]] in concurrence as Chairman of the party CMC.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| issn = 0305-7410\n| issue = 76\n| pages = 794\u2013841\n| last = Cohen\n| first = Jerome Alan\n| title = China's Changing Constitution\n| journal = The China Quarterly\n| date = 1978-12-01\n| jstor = 652647\n}}</ref> The 5th NPC was convened two years early, in 1978, and a third Constitution was adopted, which also lacked the office of State Chairman. The office was finally reinstated in the fourth Constitution, adopted by the 5th Session of the 5th NPC in 1982.  The title of the office (\u56fd\u5bb6\u4e3b\u5e2d, guojia zhuxi) was unchanged in the Chinese text, but a new English translation of \"President of the People's Republic of China\" was adopted.\n\n=== Restoration in 1982 ===\nIn the 1982 Constitution, the president was conceived of as a [[figurehead]] of state with actual state power resting in the hands of the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary of the Communist Party]], [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|premier of the State Council]] and the [[chairman of the Central Military Commission]], and all four posts were designed to be held by separate people. The president therefore held minor responsibilities such as greeting foreign dignitaries and signing the appointment of embassy staff, and did not intervene in the affairs of the State Council or the party. In the original 1982 Constitution plan, the party would develop policy, the state would execute it, and the power would be divided to prevent a [[cult of personality]] from forming as it did with the case of Mao Zedong. Thus in 1982, China perceivably had four main leaders: Hu Yaobang, the party general secretary; Zhao Ziyang, the premier; Li Xiannian, the president; and Deng Xiaoping, the \"paramount leader\", holding title of the [[chairman of the Central Military Commission]] and was overall [[commander-in-chief]] of the armed forces. The current [[Politics of Vietnam|political structure of Vietnam]] is similar to the structure China followed in the 1980s.\n\nIn the 1990s, the experiment of separating party and state posts, which led to conflict during the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], was terminated. In 1993, the post of President was taken by [[Jiang Zemin]], who as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Communist Party]] and [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]], became the undisputed top leader of the party and the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://multimedia.scmp.com/widgets/china/cpc-primer/|title=A simple guide to the Chinese government|publisher=[[South China Morning Post]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180513080847/https://multimedia.scmp.com/widgets/china/cpc-primer/|archive-date=13 May 2018|access-date=12 May 2018|quote=[[Xi Jinping]] is the most powerful figure in the Chinese political system.

They are already on the infobox.--> is the [[head of state]] of the [[People's Republic of China]]. Under the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|country's constitution]], the presidency is a largely [[Figurehead|ceremonial office]] with limited power. However, since 1993, as a matter of convention, the presidency has been held simultaneously by the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary of the Communist Party of China]], the [[Paramount leader|top leader]] in the [[One-party state|one party system]]. The presidency is officially regarded as [[Government of the People's Republic of China|an institution of the state]] rather than an administrative post; theoretically, the president serves at the pleasure of the [[National People's Congress]], the legislature, and is not legally vested to take executive action on its own prerogative.{{NoteTag|It is listed as such in the current Constitution; it is thus equivalent to organs such as the State Council, rather than to offices such as that of the Premier.}} The current president is [[Xi Jinping]], who took office in March 2013.\n\nSince 1993, apart from brief periods of transition, the top leader of China simultaneously serves as the president, the [[Leader of the Communist Party of China|leader of the party]] (as [[General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party|General Secretary]]), and the [[Supreme Military Command of the People's Republic of China|commander-in-chief]] of the military (as the [[chairman of the Central Military Commission]]). This individual then carries out different duties under separate titles. For example, the leader meets foreign dignitaries and receives ambassadors in his capacity as President, issues military directives as Chairman of [[Central Military Commission (China)|the Central Military Commission]], and upholds party rule as the general secretary of [[Communist Party of China|the Communist Party of China]].\n\nThe presidency was first established in the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]] in 1954 and successively held by [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Liu Shaoqi]]. Liu fell into political disgrace during the [[Cultural Revolution]], after which the presidency became vacant. The presidency was abolished under the Constitution of 1975, then reinstated in the Constitution of 1982, but with reduced powers. The official English-language [[translation]] of the title was \"[[Chairman]]\"; after 1982, this translation was changed to \"[[President (government title)|President]]\", although the Chinese title remains unchanged.{{NoteTag|In [[Chinese language|Chinese]] the President of the PRC is termed ''zh\u01d4x\u00ed'' while the Presidents of other countries are termed ''z\u01d2ngt\u01d2ng''. Furthermore ''zh\u01d4x\u00ed'' continues to have the meaning of \"chairman\" in a generic context.}}\n\nBetween 1982 and 2018, the constitution stipulated that the president could not serve more than two consecutive terms. During the Mao era and also since 2018, there were no term limits attached to this office.\n\n== Qualifications and election ==\nAccording to the current [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]], the president must be a Chinese citizen with full electoral rights who has reached the age of 45.\n\nThe president is elected by the [[National People's Congress]] (NPC), China's highest state body, which also has the power to remove the president and other state officers from office. Elections and removals are decided by a simple majority vote.<ref>[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/constitution/constitution.html Constitution of the People's Republic of China] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812224210/http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/constitution/constitution.html |date=12 August 2010 }}, Articles 62, 63.</ref>\n\nAccording to the Organic Law of the NPC, the president is nominated by the NPC [[Presidium of the National People's Congress|Presidium]], the Congress's executive organ.<ref>{{Cite web |title = Organic Law of the National People's Congress of the PRC |accessdate = 2013-07-03 |url = http://www.china.org.cn/english/government/207281.htm |archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/6a1t4WswJ?url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/government/207281.htm |archive-date = 15 July 2015 |url-status = live }}, Article 13.</ref> In practice, however, the ruling [[Communist Party of China]] reserves the post of president for its current [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]].

In addition, the president names and dismisses ambassadors to foreign countries, signs and annuls treaties with foreign entities. According to the Constitution, all of these powers require the approval or confirmation of the [[National People's Congress]]. The president also conducts state visits on behalf of the People's Republic. Under the constitution the \"state visit\" clause is the only presidential power that does not stipulate any form of oversight from the National People's Congress. As the vast majority of presidential powers are dependent on the ratification of the NPC, the president is, in essence, a symbolic post without any direct say in the governance of state.  It is therefore conceived to mainly function as an symbolic institution of the state rather than an office with true executive powers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/10/world/asia/china-xi-jinping-term-limit-explainer.html|title=Ending Term Limits for China\u2019s Xi Is a Big Deal.

Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] had a personal [[Ilyushin Il-18]] which he used on his visits. After he died, the aircraft was withdrawn from service and preserved at an aviation museum in China. In the 1970s, the position of Chinese president was abolished, but [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Hua Guofeng]] were [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China]] successively. With the introduction of the Boeing 747, officials started using the CAAC [[Boeing 747SP]] for international trips. After the CAAC was split up into six in 1988, the 747s were handed over to Air China, and officials continued using 747SPs under the CA livery. \n\nWhen [[Jiang Zemin]] came into power in 1989, the 747SPs were permanently returned to passenger service, and 747-400s were utilized. They were used throughout the use of Zemin, [[Hu Jintao]] and [[Xi Jinping]]. The 747-400s originally belong to Air China, but one month before the president goes on an official trip, the chosen plane is specifically inspected and retrofitted for VIP use. After the president returns to Beijing, the 747-400 is inspected and converted back to passenger configurations. \n\nIn the 2010s a [[Boeing 747-8]] painted in the CA livery was seen around the world, under the fake rego B-2479 and the real rego B-2485. Rumours spread, saying this would be China's new Air Force One. In 2016 it was seen landing in Hamburg for VIP configuration, and since then, it has been on loan to the Chinese Government from Air China for use by the president. Although no official photos have been released, the inside is thought to have a far more lavish interior, including conference tables, seating for the press, private bedrooms, and other features. \n\nAfter the 747-8 was introduced, the 747-400s now carry ministers and serve as decoy aircraft. On some occasions, an Air China Boeing 737 has even been used for transport. In the late 2010s, the president started importing his own presidential car on foreign trips. For this reason, an Air China Boeing 747 cargo aircraft is used for transportation of freight. \n\nIn order not to confuse air traffic control between a normal CA flight and a flight carrying a Chinese government member, all aircraft carrying government people fly under the callsign CA1 to CA100, since normal CA flights fly under the callsign CA101 and above.\n\n== Political ranking ==\n{{Main|Orders of precedence in the People's Republic of China}}\n\nFor President [[Liu Shaoqi]], he was also the first [[Vice Chairman of the Communist Party of China|vice chairman of the Communist Party of China]], ranked second in the [[Communist Party of China]], behind Chairman [[Mao Zedong]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mathews|first1=Jay|title=5 Children of Liu Shaoqi Detail Years in Disfavor|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/03/04/5-children-of-liu-shaoqi-detail-years-in-disfavor/024ff499-48af-4c41-b47c-fd7e0031bf75/|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=Washington Post|date=4 March 1980|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429154152/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/03/04/5-children-of-liu-shaoqi-detail-years-in-disfavor/024ff499-48af-4c41-b47c-fd7e0031bf75/|archive-date=29 April 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> For President [[Li Xiannian]], he was also the 5th ranked member of the [[Politburo Standing Committee]], after CPC general secretary and premier.<ref>{{cite news|title=Li Xiannian: China's new president|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/06/18/Personality-SpotlightNEWLNLi-Xiannian-Chinas-new-president/5105424756800/|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=[[United Press International|UPI]]|date=18 June 1983|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312205229/https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/06/18/Personality-SpotlightNEWLNLi-Xiannian-Chinas-new-president/5105424756800/|archive-date=12 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> For President [[Yang Shangkun]], he was not a member of Politburo Standing Committee, but he ranked third after General Secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] and [[Deng Xiaoping]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Del Vecchio|first1=Mark S.|title=Yang Shangkun elected Chinese president|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1988/04/08/Yang-Shangkun-elected-Chinese-president/9536576475200/|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=UPI|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312205223/https://www.upi.com/Archives/1988/04/08/Yang-Shangkun-elected-Chinese-president/9536576475200/|archive-date=12 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Since [[Jiang Zemin]], the president is also the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary of the Communist Party of China]], ranking first in party and state.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jiang Zemin to have lower rank in Communist party|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/9823478/Jiang-Zemin-to-have-lower-rank-in-Communist-party.html|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312234448/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/9823478/Jiang-Zemin-to-have-lower-rank-in-Communist-party.html|archive-date=12 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Establishment in 1954 ===\nThe office of State Chairman (the original English translation, as noted above) was first established under the 1954 Constitution.

It was abolished under the 1975 Constitution.\n\nThe state chairman's governmental powers were defined in the 1954 Constitution as follows: \"The Chairman of the People's Republic of China, whenever necessary, convenes a Supreme State Conference ({{zh|\u6700\u9ad8\u56fd\u52a1\u4f1a\u8bae}}) and acts as its chairman.\"  The members of the Supreme State Conference included the main officers of state, and its views were to be presented to the main organs of state and government, including the National People's Congress and the State and National Defense Councils.<ref>[http://e-chaupak.net/database/chicon/1954/1954bilingual.htm Constitution of the People's Republic of China] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140601163025/http://e-chaupak.net/database/chicon/1954/1954bilingual.htm |date=1 June 2014 }}, Article 44.</ref> The Supreme State Conference was also unique to the 1954 Constitution. It was abolished under the 1975 Constitution and later Constitutions have not included a similar body.\n\n=== History up to 1974 ===\n[[Mao Zedong]] was the first to hold the office of State Chairman. He was elected at the founding session of the National People's Congress in 1955. At the 2nd NPC in 1959, Mao was succeeded by [[Liu Shaoqi]], first [[Vice Chairman of the Communist Party of China|vice chairman of the Communist Party]]. Liu was reelected as State Chairman at the 3rd NPC in Jan 1965. However, in 1966, Mao launched the [[Cultural Revolution]] and by August 1966 Mao and his supporters succeeding in removing Liu from his position as party vice chairman. A few months later Liu was apparently placed under house arrest, and after a prolonged power struggle the 12th Plenum of the 8th Communist Party Congress stripped Liu Shaoqi of all his party and non-party positions on 31 October 1968, including the post of State Chairman.  This was in violation of the Constitution, which required a vote by the NPC to remove the state chairman.{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\nAfter Liu's removal in 1968, the office of State Chairman was vacant. From 1972 to 1975, however, state media referred to Vice State Chairman [[Dong Biwu]] as \"acting state chairman.\"{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\n=== Abolition in 1975 ===\nWhen the 4th NPC was convened in 1975, its main act was to adopt a new Constitution which eliminated the office of State Chairman and emphasized instead the leadership of the Communist Party over the state, including an article that made the party chairman [[Supreme Military Command of the People's Republic of China|Supreme Commander]] of the [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]] in concurrence as Chairman of the party CMC.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| issn = 0305-7410\n| issue = 76\n| pages = 794\u2013841\n| last = Cohen\n| first = Jerome Alan\n| title = China's Changing Constitution\n| journal = The China Quarterly\n| date = 1978-12-01\n| jstor = 652647\n}}</ref> The 5th NPC was convened two years early, in 1978, and a third Constitution was adopted, which also lacked the office of State Chairman. The office was finally reinstated in the fourth Constitution, adopted by the 5th Session of the 5th NPC in 1982.  The title of the office (\u56fd\u5bb6\u4e3b\u5e2d, guojia zhuxi) was unchanged in the Chinese text, but a new English translation of \"President of the People's Republic of China\" was adopted.\n\n=== Restoration in 1982 ===\nIn the 1982 Constitution, the president was conceived of as a [[figurehead]] of state with actual state power resting in the hands of the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary of the Communist Party]], [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|premier of the State Council]] and the [[chairman of the Central Military Commission]], and all four posts were designed to be held by separate people. The president therefore held minor responsibilities such as greeting foreign dignitaries and signing the appointment of embassy staff, and did not intervene in the affairs of the State Council or the party. In the original 1982 Constitution plan, the party would develop policy, the state would execute it, and the power would be divided to prevent a [[cult of personality]] from forming as it did with the case of Mao Zedong. Thus in 1982, China perceivably had four main leaders: Hu Yaobang, the party general secretary; Zhao Ziyang, the premier; Li Xiannian, the president; and Deng Xiaoping, the \"paramount leader\", holding title of the [[chairman of the Central Military Commission]] and was overall [[commander-in-chief]] of the armed forces. The current [[Politics of Vietnam|political structure of Vietnam]] is similar to the structure China followed in the 1980s.\n\nIn the 1990s, the experiment of separating party and state posts, which led to conflict during the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], was terminated. In 1993, the post of President was taken by [[Jiang Zemin]], who as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Communist Party]] and [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]], became the undisputed top leader of the party and the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://multimedia.scmp.com/widgets/china/cpc-primer/|title=A simple guide to the Chinese government|publisher=[[South China Morning Post]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180513080847/https://multimedia.scmp.com/widgets/china/cpc-primer/|archive-date=13 May 2018|access-date=12 May 2018|quote=[[Xi Jinping]] is the most powerful figure in the Chinese political system.

He sent the first Finnish radiosonde aloft in December 1931. After the first sounding, V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 continued with further development and tests until a radiosonde could be brought into production and deliveries started in 1936. From the very start, Vaisala was an international business, exporting 95 percent of the production. As the Vaisala radiosonde became internationally renowned, the demand for them increased. In 1944, Prof. V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 established a company called ''Mittari'' [[Osakeyhti\u00f6|Oy]] (\"Gauge Incorporated\") and set up manufacturing facilities for radiosonde systems.  The first sounding system included a semi-automatic radiosonde receiver, a calibration device and a ground check set. The company employed 13 people at the time. Later, in 1955, the name of Mittari was changed to Vaisala.\n\nFrom a modest start, the company evolved to become a world leader in many measurement fields and to establish a noteworthy Finnish export industry. At the end of 1954 a modern manufacturing plant was relocated in Vantaa. Since then, the headquarters have been expanded several times and Vaisala's product range has been diversified and expanded greatly. Nowadays Vaisala employs over 1,800 people and serves customers in over 150 countries.<ref>[http://www.vaisala.com/en/corporate/history/Pages/default.aspx Vaisala's History website]</ref>\n\n===Commercial production since 1936===\nAfter the first sounding, V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 continued with further development and tests until a radiosonde could be brought into commercial production. Radiosonde deliveries started with the ''RS11'' (1936\u2013). Amongst its first customers was the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. In 1937, V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4's radiosonde won a gold medal at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937)|World Fair in Paris]].\n\n===Recovering from the wars===\nWorld War II, the Finnish Winter War 1939\u20131940 and the Finnish Continuation War 1941\u20131944, disrupted many lives and upset business and delivery activities internationally. The post-war decades witnessed a strenuous effort to revive the national and international economies. Vaisala grew to employ 60 people in 1954. The first issue of Vaisala News magazine was published in 1959. Thanks to major product development efforts, during the 1950s and 1960s the Vaisala Sounding System became completely electronic, the first automatic radiosonde receiver and the world's first fully transistorized radiosonde ''RS13'' (1965\u2013) were introduced, and the first weather satellite image receiver was delivered. Yrj\u00f6 Toivola took over as the Managing Director of the company when Professor Vilho V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 died in 1969.\n\n===Vigorous 70s and& 80s===\nThe 1970s and 1980s were busy decades for Vaisala. Thin-film technology was developed for Vaisala HUMICAP\u00ae relative humidity sensors - the first in the world.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} The Vaisala CORA Automatic Sounding System - along with automatic weather stations, road weather stations and aviation weather systems - was introduced. In 1975, Vaisala employed over 200 people. During the 1980s, numerous new offices were established to ensure the company's ability to serve customers worldwide - in the UK, Japan, USA, Germany, and Australia. A traffic weather company was also acquired in the UK. Vaisala's first cleanroom was built to enable the design and manufacture of semiconductors in-house. Vaisala BAROCAP\u00ae barometric pressure sensor technology was introduced, as well as a new radiosonde family - the Vaisala Radiosonde ''RS80'' (1981\u20132008). These units made use of a water activated wet battery that had a very long storage life and high power density but a limited working life. The Professor Vilho V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 Award was established in cooperation with the WMO, to stimulate interest in meteorological research involving meteorological observation methods and instruments.\n\nThe radiosondes have also been used in many upper air ozone research studies using an attached detector that had the sensor data multiplexed with the standard meteorology dataset. GPS positioning information was added to gain more accurate wind speed information.\n\n===New millennium===\nCEO Pekka Ketonen was appointed in 1992. The company was listed on the Helsinki Exchanges in 1994. By then, it employed over 600 people. Further product developments included the introduction of GPS technology for upper air wind measurement, the Vaisala CARBOCAP CO2 sensor, and Vaisala DRYCAP sensor technology for industrial dewpoint measurement. New offices were established in France and China, and business acquisitions in aviation weather and surface weather further enhanced Vaisala's presence in the USA.\n\n[[File:Vaisala RS92 and RS41 radiosondes.jpg|thumb|Vaisala RS92-SGPD (left) and its successor, the RS41-SGP (right).]]\nThe new millennium was kicked off with yet more business acquisitions - in wind profiling, lightning detection and aviation weather. U.S. manufacturing operations were concentrated in [[Boulder, Colorado]]. New product launches included a new radiosonde product family - the Vaisala Radiosonde ''RS92'' (2003 - in production), as well as the Vaisala Weather Transmitter, which measures the six most essential weather parameters in one compact instrument.  This was much improved from the previous generation device and now included consumer cells<ref>{{cite web|title=Nalezli jste radiosondu?|url=http://www.lovecpokladu.cz/home/nalezli-jste-radiosondu-6208|publisher=ovecpokladu.cz|accessdate=25 February 2016}}</ref> to make up the battery due to energy saving techniques.\n\nCEO Ketonen retired October 1, 2006.  Vaisala's board of directors appointed Kjell Fors\u00e9n the new company CEO.  Fors\u00e9n last served as president of Ericsson Finland before joining Vaisala on September 18, 2006.\n\nVaisala technology has played a part in space exploration for some 60 years, for instance the [[Curiosity (rover)|Mars Rover Curiosity]] and [[Schiaparelli EDM lander]] contain pressure and humidity sensors manufactured by Vaisala.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Mars Rover Curiosity Equipped with Vaisala's Pressure and Humidity Sensors|url=http://www.vaisala.com/en/press/news/2012/Pages/Page_20120824021639.aspx|publisher=Vaisala|accessdate=19 February 2015|date=24 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite pressrelease|title=Vaisala and Finnish Meteorological Institute Head for Mars with the ExoMars Mission|url=http://www.vaisala.com/en/press/news/2016/Pages/Page_1992532.aspx|publisher=Vaisala|accessdate=10 March 2016|date=8 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith new developments in miniaturization, communications and sensors a new radiosonde the model ''RS41'' (2014 - in production) was announced.

He sent the first Finnish radiosonde aloft in December 1931. After the first sounding, V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 continued with further development and tests until a radiosonde could be brought into production and deliveries started in 1936. From the very start, Vaisala was an international business, exporting 95 percent of the production. As the Vaisala radiosonde became internationally renowned, the demand for them increased. In 1944, Prof. V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 established a company called ''Mittari'' [[Osakeyhti\u00f6|Oy]] (\"Gauge Incorporated\") and set up manufacturing facilities for radiosonde systems.  The first sounding system included a semi-automatic radiosonde receiver, a calibration device and a ground check set. The company employed 13 people at the time. Later, in 1955, the name of Mittari was changed to Vaisala.\n\nFrom a modest start, the company evolved to become a world leader in many measurement fields and to establish a noteworthy Finnish export industry. At the end of 1954 a modern manufacturing plant was relocated in Vantaa. Since then, the headquarters have been expanded several times and Vaisala's product range has been diversified and expanded greatly. Nowadays Vaisala employs over 1,800 people and serves customers in over 150 countries.<ref>[http://www.vaisala.com/en/corporate/history/Pages/default.aspx Vaisala's History website]</ref>\n\n===Commercial production since 1936===\nAfter the first sounding, V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 continued with further development and tests until a radiosonde could be brought into commercial production. Radiosonde deliveries started with the ''RS11'' (1936\u2013). Amongst its first customers was the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. In 1937, V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4's radiosonde won a gold medal at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937)|World Fair in Paris]].\n\n===Recovering from the wars===\nWorld War II, the Finnish Winter War 1939\u20131940 and the Finnish Continuation War 1941\u20131944, disrupted many lives and upset business and delivery activities internationally. The post-war decades witnessed a strenuous effort to revive the national and international economies. Vaisala grew to employ 60 people in 1954. The first issue of Vaisala News magazine was published in 1959. Thanks to major product development efforts, during the 1950s and 1960s the Vaisala Sounding System became completely electronic, the first automatic radiosonde receiver and the world's first fully transistorized radiosonde ''RS13'' (1965\u2013) were introduced, and the first weather satellite image receiver was delivered. Yrj\u00f6 Toivola took over as the Managing Director of the company when Professor Vilho V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 died in 1969.\n\n===Vigorous 70s and& 80s===\nThe 1970s and 1980s were busy decades for Vaisala. Thin-film technology was developed for Vaisala HUMICAP\u00ae relative humidity sensors - the first in the world.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} The Vaisala CORA Automatic Sounding System - along with automatic weather stations, road weather stations and aviation weather systems - was introduced. In 1975, Vaisala employed over 200 people. During the 1980s, numerous new offices were established to ensure the company's ability to serve customers worldwide - in the UK, Japan, USA, Germany, and Australia. A traffic weather company was also acquired in the UK. Vaisala's first cleanroom was built to enable the design and manufacture of semiconductors in-house. Vaisala BAROCAP\u00ae barometric pressure sensor technology was introduced, as well as a new radiosonde family - the Vaisala Radiosonde ''RS80'' (1981\u20132008). These units made use of a water activated wet battery that had a very long storage life and high power density but a limited working life. The Professor Vilho V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 Award was established in cooperation with the WMO, to stimulate interest in meteorological research involving meteorological observation methods and instruments.\n\nThe radiosondes have also been used in many upper air ozone research studies using an attached detector that had the sensor data multiplexed with the standard meteorology dataset. GPS positioning information was added to gain more accurate wind speed information.\n\n===New millennium===\nCEO Pekka Ketonen was appointed in 1992. The company was listed on the Helsinki Exchanges in 1994. By then, it employed over 600 people. Further product developments included the introduction of GPS technology for upper air wind measurement, the Vaisala CARBOCAP CO2 sensor, and Vaisala DRYCAP sensor technology for industrial dewpoint measurement. New offices were established in France and China, and business acquisitions in aviation weather and surface weather further enhanced Vaisala's presence in the USA.\n\n[[File:Vaisala RS92 and RS41 radiosondes.jpg|thumb|Vaisala RS92-SGPD (left) and its successor, the RS41-SGP (right).]]\nThe new millennium was kicked off with yet more business acquisitions - in wind profiling, lightning detection and aviation weather. U.S. manufacturing operations were concentrated in [[Boulder, Colorado]]. New product launches included a new radiosonde product family - the Vaisala Radiosonde ''RS92'' (2003 - in production), as well as the Vaisala Weather Transmitter, which measures the six most essential weather parameters in one compact instrument.  This was much improved from the previous generation device and now included consumer cells<ref>{{cite web|title=Nalezli jste radiosondu?|url=http://www.lovecpokladu.cz/home/nalezli-jste-radiosondu-6208|publisher=ovecpokladu.cz|accessdate=25 February 2016}}</ref> to make up the battery due to energy saving techniques. \n\nCEO Ketonen retired October 1, 2006.  Vaisala's board of directors appointed Kjell Fors\u00e9n the new company CEO.  Fors\u00e9n last served as president of Ericsson Finland before joining Vaisala on September 18, 2006.\n\nVaisala technology has played a part in space exploration for some 60 years, for instance the [[Curiosity (rover)|Mars Rover Curiosity]] and [[Schiaparelli EDM lander]] contain pressure and humidity sensors manufactured by Vaisala.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Mars Rover Curiosity Equipped with Vaisala's Pressure and Humidity Sensors|url=http://www.vaisala.com/en/press/news/2012/Pages/Page_20120824021639.aspx|publisher=Vaisala|accessdate=19 February 2015|date=24 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite pressrelease|title=Vaisala and Finnish Meteorological Institute Head for Mars with the ExoMars Mission|url=http://www.vaisala.com/en/press/news/2016/Pages/Page_1992532.aspx|publisher=Vaisala|accessdate=10 March 2016|date=8 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith new developments in miniaturization, communications and sensors a new radiosonde the model ''RS41'' (2014 - in production) was announced.
