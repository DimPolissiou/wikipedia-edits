Umrao Singh offered a great deal of work to the government with a precondition that it should also buy the husband\u2019s work: ''\u201cThey serve along with her early works to show the development of her art and talent\u2026 But if her later works are not actually acquired by our nation, then what good will the old style work, which she herself did not value, be.\u201d <ref>Shivadas, 2014, pp. 149 \u2013 170.</ref>''  Nehru decided to solve the issue by promising Dr. Egan the requested amount of Rs. 50,000. The money was taken from the National Museum funds to acquire the Amrita Sher-Gil\u2019s collection, which became the first step towards a state-collection of modern art.\n\nThe year between 1950 and 1954 saw the acquisition of the same number of works by the artist Abanindranath Tagore. Furthermore, Abdur Rahman Chughtai was represented by ten paintings while Jamini Roy and Nandalal Bose by eight paintings each. <ref>List of paintings of National Art Gallery, Archaeological Survey of India Archive: Section/25/7/53.</ref> In 1953, in addition to Amrita\u2019s works, a collection of 66 paintings, sketches and drawings by Abanindranath Tagore were offered to the government for purchase. Pratima Tagore, Abanindranath\u2019s sister, offered her collection of 66 works of her brother to the government for Rs. 30,000. The paintings were stored at the Central Asian Antiquities Museum and shown occasionally at UNESCO meetings at the Parliament House. The National Gallery of Modern Art finally opened its doors at the Jaipur House, on 29 March 1954, under the administration of the government and an inaugural ceremony by Dr. Humayun Kabir, the then secretary of the Ministry of Education.<ref>Lochan, Rajeev: \u2018Introduction\u2019, in: Treasures of the Collection of the National Gallery of Modern Art, Unpublished essay, 2013.<br /></ref>\n\n=== Paintings ===\nThe strength of the NGMA collection is its impressive representation of the evolution of modern Indian art.

The Association organised the 3rd All India Conference\n\nfor Arts in 1948 because it noted that the first two conferences in Delhi had not been able to form a\n\ncentral art organisation that was wholly representative. They received a sum of `21 lakh for arts,\n\neducation and cultural activities from the Government of Bombay. They declared that arts did not\n\ndepend on official support alone but needed individuals and groups to come together spontaneously. If\n\nAIFACS was interested in being an official body, AIAFA was asking for an autonomous artist\n\nassociation.</ref> In 1946, the Society organised the First International Contemporary Art Exhibition that included paintings of modern French and English artists, as well as etchings from American artists.

Among the 161 paintings handed over to the National Gallery of Modern Art, Sher-Gil and Tagore\u2019s paintings comprised more than half of the Museum\u2019s collection. An exemplary part of the Museum\u2019s collection constitute the 33 paintings\u00a0 purchased by the government from Egan alongwith the 33 paintings donated by Sher- Gil\u2019s father Umrao Singh. Umrao Singh offered a great deal of work to the government with a precondition that it should also buy the husband\u2019s work: ''\u201cThey serve along with her early works to show the development of her art and talent\u2026 But if her later works are not actually acquired by our nation, then what good will the old style work, which she herself did not value, be.\u201d <ref>Shivadas, 2014, pp. 149 \u2013 170.</ref>''  Nehru decided to solve the issue by promising Dr. Egan the requested amount of Rs. 50,000. The money was taken from the National Museum funds to acquire the Amrita Sher-Gil\u2019s collection, which became the first step towards a state-collection of modern art.\n\nThe year between 1950 and 1954 saw the acquisition of the same number of works by the artist Abanindranath Tagore. Furthermore, Abdur Rahman Chughtai was represented by ten paintings while Jamini Roy and Nandalal Bose by eight paintings each. <ref>List of paintings of National Art Gallery, Archaeological Survey of India Archive: Section/25/7/53.</ref> In 1953, in addition to Amrita\u2019s works, a collection of 66 paintings, sketches and drawings by Abanindranath Tagore were offered to the government for purchase. Pratima Tagore, Abanindranath\u2019s sister, offered her collection of 66 works of her brother to the government for Rs. 30,000. The paintings were stored at the Central Asian Antiquities Museum and shown occasionally at UNESCO meetings at the Parliament House. The National Gallery of Modern Art finally opened its doors at the Jaipur House, on 29 March 1954, under the administration of the government and an inaugural ceremony by Dr. Humayun Kabir, the then secretary of the Ministry of Education.<ref>Lochan, Rajeev: \u2018Introduction\u2019, in: Treasures of the Collection of the National Gallery of Modern Art, Unpublished essay, 2013.<br /></ref>\n\n=== Paintings ===\nThe strength of the NGMA collection is its impressive representation of the evolution of modern Indian art.

A. R Chughtai, Kshitindra Majumdar and others. The Santiniketan movement explored new aesthetic dimensions in its celebration of the environment, and its masters are Nandalal Bose, Ramkinkar Baij and Benode Behari Mukherjee.\u00a0Even as the Santineketan artists flourished, four individual and original articulations of modernism emerged in the mid 1920s and 1930s.

Approximately 40% of NEM generation is consumed in New South Wales, while Victoria and Queensland consume approximately 25% each.\n\n==Operation of the physical market==\nExchange between [[Electricity generation|electricity producers]] and [[Electricity retailing|electricity consumers]] is facilitated through a [[spot market]] where the output from all generators is aggregated and instantaneously scheduled to meet demand through a centrally-coordinated [[economic dispatch|dispatch process]]{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. This process is operated by the [[Australian Energy Market Operator]] (AEMO) in accordance with the provisions of Australian National Electricity Law and Australian National Electricity Rules{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}.\n\nScheduled generators submit offers every five minutes of every day{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. From all offers submitted, AEMO\u2019s systems determine the generators required to produce electricity based on the principle of meeting prevailing demand in the most cost-efficient way (see also [[Economic dispatch]]){{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. AEMO then dispatches these generators into production by sending [[automatic generation control]] (AGC) target signals to each generating unit{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}.\n\nA dispatch price is determined every five minutes and is abbreviated as a DI. Six dispatch prices are averaged every half-hour to determine the [[spot price]] for each trading interval, and is abbreviated as a TI. There are 5 trading regions for each of the regions of the NEM{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. AEMO uses the spot price as the basis for the settlement of financial transactions for all energy traded in the NEM{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}.\n\nThere is a maximum price that generators can bid in at.  Under the Rules, the AEMC adjusts this maximum spot price MPC (market price cap) by movements in the consumer price index by 28 February each year for the rate to commence on 1 July. For the 2020-2021 financial year the MPC is $15,000/MWh.  There is a further limit on the price called the Cumulative Price Threshold.  The Cumulative Price Threshold is the sum of value of the all the TI's for the previous 7 days, calculated on a rolling basis. When this exceeds $224,600, AEMO caps the bids to a nominated value, currently $300/MWh. Whilst the price is capped in this manner, it is known as an  Administered Price period. The process continues until the rolling average drop to allow normal trading without impinging the threshold to rapidly again. \n\nMarket Price Cap (MPC) \u2013 which was previously called the [[value of lost load]] (VoLL) \u2013 is the price automatically triggered when AEMO directs network service providers to interrupt customer supply in order to keep [[supply and demand]] in the system in balance.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. For the 2020-2021 financial year the MPC is $15,000/MWh. For the 2019-2020 financial year the MPC was $14,700/MWh. For the 2018-2019 financial year the MPC was $14,500/MWh. For the 2017-2018 financial year the MPC was $14,200/MWh and the Cumulative Price Threshold was $212,800.<ref>[http://www.aemc.gov.au/News-Center/What-s-New/Announcements/AEMC-publishes-the-Schedule-of-Reliability-Set-%284%29 AEMC publishes the Schedule of Reliability Settings for 2016-17]</ref>. The maximum price was $14,000/MWh in 2016-2017, $13,800/MWh in 2015-2016, $13,500/MWh in 2014-2015, and $13,100/MWh in 2013-2014.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} \n\nThe Rules also set a minimum spot price of minus $1,000 per MWh<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.aemo.com.au/-/media/Files/PDF/National-Electricity-Market-Fact-Sheet.pdf | title=Australian Energy Market Operator| date=2013-09-17}}</ref> which is the market floor price. This negative market floor price allows generators to pay to stay online when the cost of staying online is lower than the cost of shutting down and re-starting their plants. For a renewable generator, staying online may also cost less than what generators receive from support mechanisms like the Renewable Energy Target scheme, plus their own costs.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.eex.gov.au/large-energy-users/energy-management/energy-procurement/energy-pricing/how-the-energy-market-operates | title=How the energy market operates| date=2011-12-12}}</ref>\n\n===Generators===\nFor comprehensive information of generators in Australia, see [[List of power stations in Australia]].\n\n==Transmission network service providers==\nThe transmission network service providers (TNSPs) are operators of the high voltage electricity transmission networks. There are five state-based TNSPs servicing each of the states in the NEM, with crossborder\ninterconnectors linking the state grids at state borders to allow electricity to flow from one state to another.

This is a reference to the vertical integration of companies operating in the NEM, where generators own a retail arm{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. Four companies in the Australian NEM commonly described as gentailers are [[EnergyAustralia]], [[AGL Energy]], [[Origin Energy]] and [[Snowy Hydro]] (Lumo and Red Energy being retailer brands). Additionally, [[ERM Power]] is a generator as well as small business retailer.\n\n====Gentrader====\n\n==Outcomes==\nIt has been argued that the reforms have delivered considerable economic benefits{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. A government review (December 2006) stated that the reforms have underpinned significant levels of investment in energy supply (approximately $7 billion in electricity generation and $4.4 billion in electricity transmission), improved productivity (particularly capital utilisation) and delivered internationally competitive electricity prices for Australian industry and households.<ref>[http://www.erig.gov.au/assets/documents/erig/ERIG%20Issues%20Paper%205%20July20060705184204.pdf Electricity Implementation Reform Group]</ref> In terms of the [[Climate change in Australia|climate change]] impacts of the reforms, experts have concluded that the outcome is increased emissions with respect to business as usual scenarios{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. This is due to the lower cost of coal fired generation compared to other generators, reduced emphasis on energy efficiency from lower prices, the failure to price [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, combined with market design and regulation that favours incumbents.<ref>Iain MacGill, [http://www.ceem.unsw.edu.au/content/userDocs/EVN_training_IG0907.pdf CEEM, UNSW powerpoint presentation 2007]</ref>\n\n==2017 pricing crisis==\nOn 16 October 2017, the ACCC published a preliminary report into the electricity market<ref name=ACCC161017>[https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/electricity-report-details-affordability-competition-issues Electricity report details affordability, competition issues]</ref> highlighting significant concerns about the operation of the National Electricity Market, which is leading to serious problems with affordability for consumers and businesses. ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said: \n\n:\u201cIt\u2019s no great secret that Australia has an electricity affordability problem. What\u2019s clear from our report is that price increases over the past ten years are putting Australian businesses and consumers under unacceptable pressure. Consumers have been faced with increasing pressures to their household budgets as electricity prices have skyrocketed in recent years. Residential prices have increased by 63 per cent on top of inflation since 2007-08.\u201d\n\nThe ACCC estimates that in 2016-17, Queenslanders will be paying the most for their electricity, followed by South Australians and people living in New South Wales. Victorians will have the lowest electricity bills. On average across the NEM, a 2015-16 residential bill was $1,524 (excluding GST), made up of network costs (48%), wholesale costs (22%), environmental costs (7%), retail and other costs (16%) and retail margins (8%). The ACCC attributed the main reason for electricity price increases to higher network costs for all states other than South Australia, where generation costs represented the highest increase. \"The wholesale (generation) market is highly concentrated and this is likely to be contributing to higher wholesale electricity prices.\" The ACCC accused the network operators of \"over-investing\" in poles and wires and gaming rules around revenue.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/business/energy/energy-networks-reject-accc-findings-over-price-hikes-20171016-gz1nh8.html Energy networks reject ACCC findings over price hikes]</ref> The \u2018big three\u2019 vertically integrated gentailers, AGL, Origin, and EnergyAustralia, continue to hold large retail market shares in most regions, and control in excess of 60% of generation capacity in NSW, South Australia, and Victoria making it difficult for smaller retailers to compete. Retail margins increased significantly in NSW, but decreased in others.<ref name=ACCC161017/>\n\nIn the September 2017 quarter, the price of electricity increased nationally by 8.9%.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/business/the-economy/consumer-prices-rise-06-per-cent-in-september-quarter-less-than-expected-20171025-gz7os6.html Grocery price falls not enough to offset spike in electricity]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Energy}}\n* [[Competition law]]\n* [[Competition and Consumer Act 2010]]\n* [[Economy of Australia]]\n* [[Energy policy of Australia]]\n* [[Power purchase agreement]]\n* [[Standing Council on Energy and Resources]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Economy of Australia}}\n\n[[Category:Electricity markets]]\n[[Category:Electric power in Australia]]\n[[Category:Wide area synchronous grids]]\n[[Category:Energy policy of Australia]]\n", "text_old": "The '''National Electricity Market''' ('''NEM''') is an arrangement in [[Electricity sector in Australia|Australia's electricity sector]] for the connection of the [[Wide area synchronous grid|synchronous]] [[Electric power transmission|electricity transmission]] grids of the eastern and southern Australia states and territories to create a cross-state wholesale [[electricity market]].<ref name=aemc>[http://www.aemc.gov.au/Australias-Energy-Market/Markets-Overview/National-electricity-market National Electricity Market]</ref> The [[Australian Energy Market Commission]] develops and maintains the Australian National Electricity Rules (NER), which have the force of law in the states and territories participating in NEM.

During the 2017-18 financial year, 203 TWh of  [[electricity]] with a market value of AU$17 billion was traded through the NEM, serving 9.7 million end-use consumers<ref name=\":0\" />.  Approximately 40% of NEM generation is consumed in New South Wales, while Victoria and Queensland consume approximately 25% each.\n\n==Operation of the physical market==\nExchange between [[Electricity generation|electricity producers]] and [[Electricity retailing|electricity consumers]] is facilitated through a [[spot market]] where the output from all generators is aggregated and instantaneously scheduled to meet demand through a centrally-coordinated [[economic dispatch|dispatch process]]{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. This process is operated by the [[Australian Energy Market Operator]] (AEMO) in accordance with the provisions of Australian National Electricity Law and Australian National Electricity Rules{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}.\n\nScheduled generators submit offers every five minutes of every day{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. From all offers submitted, AEMO\u2019s systems determine the generators required to produce electricity based on the principle of meeting prevailing demand in the most cost-efficient way (see also [[Economic dispatch]]){{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. AEMO then dispatches these generators into production by sending [[automatic generation control]] (AGC) target signals to each generating unit{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}.\n\nA dispatch price is determined every five minutes and is abbreviated as a DI. Six dispatch prices are averaged every half-hour to determine the [[spot price]] for each trading interval, and is abbreviated as a TI. There are 5 trading regions for each of the regions of the NEM{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. AEMO uses the spot price as the basis for the settlement of financial transactions for all energy traded in the NEM{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}.\n\nThere is a maximum price that generators can bid in at.  Under the Rules, the AEMC adjusts this maximum spot price MPC (market price cap) by movements in the consumer price index by 28 February each year for the rate to commence on 1 July. For the 2020-2021 financial year the MPC is $15,000/MWh.  There is a further limit on the price called the Cumulative Price Threshold.  The Cumulative Price Threshold is the sum of value of the all the TI's for the previous 7 days, calculated on a rolling basis. When this exceeds $224,600, AEMO caps the bids to a nominated value, currently $300/MWh. Whilst the price is capped in this manner, it is known as an  Administered Price period. The process continues until the rolling average drop to allow normal trading without impinging the threshold to rapidly again. \n\nMarket Price Cap (MPC) \u2013 which was previously called the [[value of lost load]] (VoLL) \u2013 is the price automatically triggered when AEMO directs network service providers to interrupt customer supply in order to keep [[supply and demand]] in the system in balance.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. For the 2020-2021 financial year the MPC is $15,000/MWh. For the 2019-2020 financial year the MPC was $14,700/MWh. For the 2018-2019 financial year the MPC was $14,500/MWh. For the 2017-2018 financial year the MPC was $14,200/MWh and the Cumulative Price Threshold was $212,800.<ref>[http://www.aemc.gov.au/News-Center/What-s-New/Announcements/AEMC-publishes-the-Schedule-of-Reliability-Set-%284%29 AEMC publishes the Schedule of Reliability Settings for 2016-17]</ref>. The maximum price was $14,000/MWh in 2016-2017, $13,800/MWh in 2015-2016, $13,500/MWh in 2014-2015, and $13,100/MWh in 2013-2014.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} \n\nThe Rules also set a minimum spot price of minus $1,000 per MWh<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.aemo.com.au/-/media/Files/PDF/National-Electricity-Market-Fact-Sheet.pdf | title=Australian Energy Market Operator| date=2013-09-17}}</ref> which is the market floor price. This negative market floor price allows generators to pay to stay online when the cost of staying online is lower than the cost of shutting down and re-starting their plants. For a renewable generator, staying online may also cost less than what generators receive from support mechanisms like the Renewable Energy Target scheme, plus their own costs<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.eex.gov.au/large-energy-users/energy-management/energy-procurement/energy-pricing/how-the-energy-market-operates | title=How the energy market operates| date=2011-12-12}}</ref>.\n\n===Generators===\nFor comprehensive information of generators in Australia, see [[List of power stations in Australia]].\n\n==Transmission network service providers==\nThe transmission network service providers (TNSPs) are operators of the high voltage electricity transmission networks.

The AEMC was established by the Australian Energy Market Commission Establishment Act 2004 (South Australia){{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. Many of its statutory powers are derived from the National Electricity Law (NEL)<ref>''[https://www.aemc.gov.au/about-us/ AEMC About Us''</ref>\n\n====Australian Energy Regulator====\nThe [[Australian Energy Regulator]] (AER) regulates the national electricity market{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. It is responsible for rule enforcement for the NEM as well as economic regulation of the electricity transmission and distribution networks in the NEM{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. It is also responsible for the economic regulation of gas transmission and distribution networks and enforcing the national gas law and national gas rules in all jurisdictions except Western Australia{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}.\n\n====Australian Energy Market Operator====\nThe [[Australian Energy Market Operator]] (AEMO) consists of six founding entities:\nNational Electricity Market Management Company (NEMMCO), Victorian Energy Networks Corporation (VENCorp), Electricity Supply Industry Planning Council (ESIPC), Retail Energy Market Company (REMCO), Gas Market Company (GMC), Gas Retail Market Operator (GRMO){{citation needed|date=April 2016}}.\nAEMO draws together the functions carried out by these organisations, incorporating management of the NEM and the retail and wholesale gas markets of eastern and southern Australia, and it oversees system security of the NEM electricity grid and the Victorian gas transmission network{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. In addition, it is responsible for national transmission planning and the establishment of a short term trading market for gas{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}.\n\nAEMO was established by the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) and developed under the guidance of the Ministerial Council on Energy (MCE){{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. It is run by a skills-based board of nine non-Executive Directors and the Chief Executive Officer{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}.\n\n===National Electricity Law===\nDue to the process of cooperative federalism under which the NEM was established, the National Electricity Law (NEL) is contained in a Schedule to the ''National Electricity (South Australia) Act 1996'' (SA).<ref>''[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/neaa1996388/ National Electricity (South Australia) Act 1996]''</ref> The NEL is applied as law in each participating jurisdiction of the NEM by application statutes, for example the ''National Electricity (Victoria) Act 2005''.<ref>''[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/nea2005306/ National Electricity (Victoria) Act 2005]''</ref>\n\n===National Electricity Rules===\nThe National Electricity Rules (NER) govern the operation of the National Electricity Market{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. The Rules have the force of law, and are made under the National Electricity Law{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. Up-to-date versions of the Australian National Electricity Rules can generally be found on the AEMC's website.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.aemc.gov.au/Electricity/National-Electricity-Rules/Current-Rules.html |title=National Electricity Rules Version 81 |access-date=2012-04-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917055158/http://www.aemc.gov.au/Electricity/National-Electricity-Rules/Current-Rules.html |archive-date=2010-09-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\n\n===Formal terminology===\nMuch of the terminology used in the National Electricity Market is derived from the National Electricity Law (NEL)<ref>http://corrigan.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/neaa1996388/sch1.html</ref> and National Electricity Rules (NER).\n\n====Scheduled Generator====\nA Generator in respect of which any generating unit is classified as a scheduled generating unit in accordance with Chapter 2 of the NER{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}.\n\n====Semi-Scheduled Generator====\nA generating unit which has a nameplate rating of 30 MW or greater (or is part of a group of generating units connected at a common connection point with a combined nameplate rating of 30 MW or greater), must be classified as a semi-scheduled generating unit where the output of the generating unit is intermittent unless AEMO approves its classification as a scheduled generating unit or a non-scheduled generating unit{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}.\n\n====Market Participant====\nA person who is registered by AEMO as a Market Generator, Market Customer or Market Network Service Provider under Chapter 2 of the NER{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}.\n\n====Good faith bidding====\nScheduled Generators and Market Participants must make dispatch offers, dispatch bids and rebids in good faith (s.3.8.22A, NER){{citation needed|date=April 2016}}.\n\n===Informal terminology===\n\n====Gentailer====\nThe term 'gentailer' or gen-tailer is a [[portmanteau]] word combining the terms generator and retailer, i.e. gen-tailer{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. This is a reference to the vertical integration of companies operating in the NEM, where generators own a retail arm{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. Four companies in the Australian NEM commonly described as gentailers are [[EnergyAustralia]], [[AGL Energy]], [[Origin Energy]] and [[Snowy Hydro]] (Lumo and Red Energy being retailer brands). Additionally, [[ERM Power]] is a generator as well as small business retailer.\n\n====Gentrader====\n\n==Outcomes==\nIt has been argued that the reforms have delivered considerable economic benefits{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. A government review (December 2006) stated that the reforms have underpinned significant levels of investment in energy supply (approximately $7 billion in electricity generation and $4.4 billion in electricity transmission), improved productivity (particularly capital utilisation) and delivered internationally competitive electricity prices for Australian industry and households.<ref>[http://www.erig.gov.au/assets/documents/erig/ERIG%20Issues%20Paper%205%20July20060705184204.pdf Electricity Implementation Reform Group]</ref> In terms of the [[Climate change in Australia|climate change]] impacts of the reforms, experts have concluded that the outcome is increased emissions with respect to business as usual scenarios{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. This is due to the lower cost of coal fired generation compared to other generators, reduced emphasis on energy efficiency from lower prices, the failure to price [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, combined with market design and regulation that favours incumbents.<ref>Iain MacGill, [http://www.ceem.unsw.edu.au/content/userDocs/EVN_training_IG0907.pdf CEEM, UNSW powerpoint presentation 2007]</ref>\n\n==2017 pricing crisis==\nOn 16 October 2017, the ACCC published a preliminary report into the electricity market<ref name=ACCC161017>[https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/electricity-report-details-affordability-competition-issues Electricity report details affordability, competition issues]</ref> highlighting significant concerns about the operation of the National Electricity Market, which is leading to serious problems with affordability for consumers and businesses. ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said: \n\n:\u201cIt\u2019s no great secret that Australia has an electricity affordability problem. What\u2019s clear from our report is that price increases over the past ten years are putting Australian businesses and consumers under unacceptable pressure. Consumers have been faced with increasing pressures to their household budgets as electricity prices have skyrocketed in recent years. Residential prices have increased by 63 per cent on top of inflation since 2007-08.\u201d\n\nThe ACCC estimates that in 2016-17, Queenslanders will be paying the most for their electricity, followed by South Australians and people living in New South Wales. Victorians will have the lowest electricity bills. On average across the NEM, a 2015-16 residential bill was $1,524 (excluding GST), made up of network costs (48%), wholesale costs (22%), environmental costs (7%), retail and other costs (16%) and retail margins (8%). The ACCC attributed the main reason for electricity price increases to higher network costs for all states other than South Australia, where generation costs represented the highest increase. \"The wholesale (generation) market is highly concentrated and this is likely to be contributing to higher wholesale electricity prices.\" The ACCC accused the network operators of \"over-investing\" in poles and wires and gaming rules around revenue.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/business/energy/energy-networks-reject-accc-findings-over-price-hikes-20171016-gz1nh8.html Energy networks reject ACCC findings over price hikes]</ref> The \u2018big three\u2019 vertically integrated gentailers, AGL, Origin, and EnergyAustralia, continue to hold large retail market shares in most regions, and control in excess of 60% of generation capacity in NSW, South Australia, and Victoria making it difficult for smaller retailers to compete. Retail margins increased significantly in NSW, but decreased in others.<ref name=ACCC161017/>\n\nIn the September 2017 quarter, the price of electricity increased nationally by 8.9%.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/business/the-economy/consumer-prices-rise-06-per-cent-in-september-quarter-less-than-expected-20171025-gz7os6.html Grocery price falls not enough to offset spike in electricity]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Energy}}\n* [[Competition law]]\n* [[Competition and Consumer Act 2010]]\n* [[Economy of Australia]]\n* [[Energy policy of Australia]]\n* [[Power purchase agreement]]\n* [[Standing Council on Energy and Resources]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Economy of Australia}}\n\n[[Category:Electricity markets]]\n[[Category:Electric power in Australia]]\n[[Category:Wide area synchronous grids]]\n[[Category:Energy policy of Australia]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Electricity_Market"}

The accident leaves Cassie racked with guilt and emotionally vulnerable to the point that she begins hallucinating strange visions and waking-dreams, even though Cassie's friends Annabel ([[Eliza Dushku]]) and Matt ([[Wes Bentley]]), as well as a local priest called Father Jude ([[Luke Wilson]]), all attempt to assist her in coping with the loss.\n\n==Plot==\nCassie and Sean, as well as ex-boyfriend Matt and good friend Annabel, go to a club situated in an old church. There Cassie sees a man with a clear, plastic mask ([[Carl Paoli]]) and an imposing man with a scarred face ([[Ken Moreno]]). Deathmask tries to grab her on the dance floor, but she pushes him away and steps outside the club with Sean.\n\nIn the parking lot, Matt eavesdrops on their conversation. Sean confesses his love for Cassie, who claims she feels the same way. When Sean returns to the club, Matt convinces Cassie to give him a last 'goodbye' kiss. Sean sees this, and reacts badly to it, giving Cassie the silent treatment as they drive off. Cassie, who is behind the wheel, continually looks away from the road until the car crashes. Cassie's next memory is of being rushed to the hospital; Matt and Annabel are unharmed, but Sean has been killed on impact.\n\nDuring the school term that follows, Cassie has several visions of Sean. She also has visions of Deathmask and Hideous Dancer in the company of Matt and Annabel. On several occasions, she believes she is being chased by the two men, although Annabel and Matt assure her that the incidents are all in her mind. After one chase, Cassie faints and is rescued by Father Jude, a young priest who is sympathetic to her fears and offers to listen if she ever needs someone to talk to.\n\nA few nights later, after being chased again, Cassie knocks at the church door, and Father Jude gives her sanctuary. He gives her an amulet depicting [[St Jude]] and allows her to sleep in his small room in the church. Upon awakening that morning, Cassie sees that the calendar in the room reads 1981. She enters the office of the attending priest ([[rick snyder ty|Rick Snyder]]) and asks to speak to Father Jude but is told that Father Jude died in 1981.\n\nAfter a swim competition in which she has been made to participate, Cassie is chased by Deathmask. Defending herself with the tube of a fluorescent lamp, she ends up stabbing him in the stomach but when Cassie returns with Matt, they find there is no body in the pool. Even though she believes that Matt and Annabel are conspiring against her with Deathmask and Hideous Dancer, Cassie requests that Matt take her home to her mother. Instead he drives Cassie to the club, saying that he wishes to pick up Annabel. Cassie follows him but gets lost, eventually finding Annabel with a new lover called Raven ([[Angela Featherstone]]). When Raven tells Cassie to \"leave or die\" Cassie exits the club and makes her way back to the parking lot. There Matt drunkenly insists on another 'goodbye forever' kiss, but Cassie smashes a bottle on his head knocking him unconscious before pushing him from the car and driving away.\n\nIn a scene resembling the original accident, Cassie wrecks the car. She again comes to in the hospital. On a gurney next to her is Raven, who speaks a few words of comfort before dying. Father Jude arrives and asks if she would be willing to die in order to save Sean's life. She agrees and he then asks her if she would be willing to live for him. Cassie says that she doesn't want to die.\n\nAn episode follows in which Deathmask and Hideous Dancer strangle her with her protective medallion, from which Cassie wakes to find that everything she has experienced has been a sort of coma-dream: in the original accident, Cassie and Sean had survived, while Matt and Annabel were killed. The occupants of the other car \u2014 Raven, Deathmask, and Hideous Dancer \u2014 were also fatally injured. Cassie has spent the course of the film in an astral state, wherein those who were killed in the accident attempt to keep her with them. Father Jude, and Cassie's visions of Sean were what brought her back to life.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Melissa Sagemiller]] as Cassie\n* [[Casey Affleck]] as Sean\n* [[Eliza Dushku]] as Annabel\n* [[Wes Bentley]] as Matt\n* [[Angela Featherstone]] as Raven\n* [[Luke Wilson]] as Father Jude\n* Allen Hamilton as Dr. Haverston\n* [[Carl Paoli]] as Deathmask\n* [[Barbara E.

Although the lead actress is actually Melissa Sagemiller, Eliza Dushku who had a smaller role was put in the front on the poster as the studio hoped to draw her Buffy the Vampire Slayer fans in.

''Federalism in America: An Encyclopedia''.</ref> NCSL has three objectives: to improve the quality and effectiveness of state legislatures; to promote policy innovation and communication among state legislatures; and to ensure state legislatures a strong, cohesive voice in the federal system. All state legislators and staff members are automatically members of NCSL. \n\nNCSL maintains two offices: one in [[Denver, Colorado]], and the other in [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\nEight Standing Committees, composed of legislators and legislative staff appointed by the leadership of the legislatures, serve as the central organizing mechanism for NCSL members. Each Committee provides a means by which state legislators can share experience, information, and advice on a variety of state issues ranging from policy to management. \n\nCommittees meet together twice each year at NCSL's Fall Forum and NCSL's Legislative Summit to adopt state-federal legislative policies that will ultimately guide NCSLs' lobbying efforts in Washington, D.C. These committee meetings also serve as an opportunity for states to network and establish flows of information as well as experience-based suggestions from other states. In addition to the Capitol Forum and the Summit, NCSL builds the state legislative community by hosting various web seminars, leadership meetings, and access to relevant websites and online documents throughout the year. \n\nIssues spanning multiple committee jurisdictions are tackled by NCSL's Task Forces. Unlike the permanent Standing Committees, Task Forces are created for a specific period time and aim to develop positions on highly complex and controversial issues such as immigration reform and welfare. Task Forces are composed of 20 to 30 legislators and legislative staff who are appointed by the NCSL president or staff chair. \n\nDay-to-day operations of the organization are in the hands of its Executive Director, Tim Storey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/press-room/tim-storey-named-new-executive-director-of-ncsl.aspx|title=Tim Storey Named New Executive Director of NCSL|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The organization is led by a legislator who serves as its president and by a legislative staffer who serves as staff chair.

NCSL opposes unfunded federal mandates and federal preemption of state authority, providing state legislatures with the flexibility to implement policy solutions. \nNCSL supports enactment of the [[Main Street Fairness Act]], which would simplify existing sales tax collection laws. The Act would grant states the authority to require all sellers, including online merchants, to collect sales and use taxes, generating billions of dollars of tax revenue for state governments. \n\n==Events==\nNCSL organizes two annual events for the general membership:\n\n*Capitol Forum\n*Legislative Summit (Annual Meeting)\n\nThe Legislative Summit is the largest of these events, partly because it occurs in the summer when state legislatures are in recess.

''Federalism in America: An Encyclopedia''.</ref> NCSL has three objectives: to improve the quality and effectiveness of state legislatures; to promote policy innovation and communication among state legislatures; and to ensure state legislatures a strong, cohesive voice in the federal system. All state legislators and staff members are automatically members of NCSL. \n\nNCSL maintains two offices: one in [[Denver, Colorado]], and the other in [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\nEight Standing Committees, composed of legislators and legislative staff appointed by the leadership of the legislatures, serve as the central organizing mechanism for NCSL members. Each Committee provides a means by which state legislators can share experience, information, and advice on a variety of state issues ranging from policy to management. \n\nCommittees meet together twice each year at NCSL's Fall Forum and NCSL's Legislative Summit to adopt state-federal legislative policies that will ultimately guide NCSLs' lobbying efforts in Washington, D.C. These committee meetings also serve as an opportunity for states to network and establish flows of information as well as experience-based suggestions from other states. In addition to the Capitol Forum and the Summit, NCSL builds the state legislative community by hosting various web seminars, leadership meetings, and access to relevant websites and online documents throughout the year. \n\nIssues spanning multiple committee jurisdictions are tackled by NCSL's Task Forces.
