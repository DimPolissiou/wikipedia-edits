Two different sets of hairless felines discovered in North America in the 1970s provided the foundation cats for what was shaped into the existing Sphynx breed.\n\nThe current American and European Sphynx breed is descended from two lines of natural mutations:\n\n* Dermis and Epidermis (1975) barn cats from the Pearson family of [[Wadena, Minnesota|Wadena]], [[Minnesota]]<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.wadenapj.com/news/469144-prestigious-sphynx-cats-once-considered-feral-breed|title=Prestigious Sphynx cats once considered 'feral' breed|last=|first=|date=January 21, 2012|work=Wadena Pioneer Journal|access-date=2018-05-23}}</ref>\n* Bambi, Punkie, and Paloma (1978) stray cats found in [[Toronto, Ontario]], [[Canada]], and raised by Shirley Smith<ref name=\":5\">{{cite web |url= http://beeblebroxsphynx.com/health/about-the-breed/history/ |title=Sphynx Cat History |website= BeeblebroxSphynx.com |accessdate=2010-11-17}}</ref>\n\n=== Toronto ===\nThe Canadian Sphynx breed was started in 1966 in Toronto when a hairless [[kitten]] named Prune was born to a black and white domestic shorthair queen (Elizabeth).<ref name=\":5\" /> The kitten was [[mating|mated]] with its mother (something called [[backcrossing]]), which produced one more naked kitten. Together with a few naked kittens found later, the cat Prune marked the first attempt to create a hairless breed.\n\nAfter purchasing these cats in 1966 and initially referring to them as \"Moonstones\" and \"Canadian Hairless,\" Ridyadh Bawa, a science graduate of the [[University of Toronto]], combined efforts with his mother Yania, a long time Siamese breeder,<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cat-world.com.au/sphynx-cat-breed-profile.html|title=Sphynx Cat Breed-History, Appearance & Temperament|date=April 4, 2018|website=Cat World|access-date=2018-05-23}}</ref> and Keese and Rita Tenhoves to develop a breed of cats which was subsequently renamed as \"Sphynx\".

The [[gene pool|genetic pool]] was very limited and many kittens died. There was also a problem with many of the [[female]]s suffering [[convulsion]]s. In 1978, cat breeder Shirley Smith of Ontario, Canada, found three hairless kittens on the streets of her neighborhood.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.petfinder.com/cat-breeds/sphynx|title=Sphynx Cat, history|last=|first=|date=|work=Petfinder.com|access-date=2018-05-23}}</ref> In 1983 she sent two of them to Dr. Hugo Hernandez in the Netherlands to breed the two kittens, named Punkie and Paloma, to a white [[Devon Rex]] named Curare van Jetrophin.<ref name=\":3\" /> The resulting litter produced five kittens: two males from this litter (Q. Ramses and Q.

Allergies to cats are triggered by a protein called [[Fel d1]], not cat hair itself. Fel d1 is a [[protein]] primarily found in cat [[saliva]] and [[sebaceous glands]]. Those with cat allergies may react worse to direct contact with Sphynx cats than other breeds; even though reports exist that some people with allergies successfully tolerate Sphynx cats, they are fewer than those who have allergic reactions, according to David Rosenstreich, MD, the director of the Division of Allergy and Immunology at the [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]] and [[Montefiore Medical Center]] in the [[Bronx]], New York City, New York.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.ankhamun.com/Hypoallergenic%20cats.htm |url-status= dead| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110718192703/http://www.ankhamun.com/Hypoallergenic%20cats.htm| archivedate= July 18, 2011 |title= The Big Question, What about allergies? |website= Ankhamun.com |accessdate= February 9, 2017}}</ref> These positive reports may be cases of [[Allergy to cats#Desensitizing|desensitizing]], wherein the \"hairless\" cat gave the owner optimism to try to own a cat, eventually leading to the positive situation of their own adaptation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nSphynx cats can also have more ear wax than most hairy domestic cats because they have little to no hair in their ears.

Ta\u1e37\u1e37ap\u0101ka Annam\u0101c\u0101rya (Annamayya), widely regarded as the Andhra Pada kavit\u0101 Pit\u0101maha (Grandfather of Telugu songwriting) was a 15th-century Hindu saint, and is the earliest known Indian musician in Carnatic music to compose songs called sankirtanas in praise of the god Venkateswara.\n\nTo preserve the rich heritage of Annamayya compositions, Annamayya Paataku Pattabhishekam was taken up on an ambitious scale by the TTD and its propagation arms Sri Venkateswara Bhakti Channel (SVBC) and Sri Venkateswara Recording Project (SVRP), designed by renowned film director K. Raghavendra Rao, a member of the TTD trust board. Music director M.M. Keeravani added grandeur to the program through his vital inputs.\n\nSinger Sunitha is the Anchor for this culturally unique show ever since the conception of the program.

The program recorded 59 episodes in Season 1 and so far recorded 138 episodes in season 2 by composing and giving life to 1000 rare sankeerthanas out of 32,000 sankeertanas penned by Annamayya on the god Venkateswara (only about 12,000 are available today). Sunitha by herself rendered 140 sankeerthanas so far, offering them as her floral offerings to lord Venkateswara which includes the very first sankeerthana sung by her that unveils every new episode with a known popular composition. Here are the list of few Sankeerthanas recorded by Sunitha in Annamayya Paataku Pattabhishekam out of the 1000 compositions this program recorded:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Sankeerthana\n|-\n|Vevelaku nokate vinnapamide\n|-\n|Magaroopunu aadu roopu maaruchukoni riddaru\n|-\n|Okka maatu saranani undeninthe kaaka\n|-\n|Ratibatima sesina ramachandra nee chetiloni daananinte\n|-\n|Yemanunnado nee chittameraga nenu\n|-\n|Yenta gaaravinchevo yemi baathimi neeku\n|-\n|Aatadevvaadu choopare ammalaala\n|-\n|Naa valla kadama ledu nammithi ninnu\n|-\n|Aatade yeragadaa aakelaagu raati gunde thoda\n|-\n|Annita nerparivi neevaaduvayya\n|-\n|Panigona nerchu vaari bhaagyamu koladedi\n|-\n|Maatalaada nerani ramanivo nenu\n|-\n|Cheluvuda choodumaa ee cheliya singaaramu\n|-\n|Maguva nenu neevu magavaadavu\n|-\n|Idivo idivo inthata varambeevayya\n|}\nAnnamayya Paataku Pattabhishekam was also performed live in cities like Tirupathi, Vishakapatnam with the name Vishaka teeramlo vishnupadaarchana, Vijayawada with the name Ammavaari sannidhilo annamayya swaraarchana which are as well hosted by Sunitha along with performing and offering few keerthanas from her voice.

Her first poem was Tarikonda Nrusimha Satakam and it was followed by Nrusimha Vilasa Katha, Siva Natakam and Balakrishna Natakam as Yakshaganam and Rajayogamrutha Saram, a Dwipada Kavyam, Vishnu Parijatham, Chenchu Natakam, Rukmini Natakam, Jala Krida Vilasam, Mukthi Kanthi Vilasam (all Yaksha Ganams), Gopi Natakam (Golla Kalapam-Yakshaganam), Rama Parinayam, Sri Bhagavatham, Sri Krishna Manjari, Tatva Keerthanalu and Vashista Ramayanam (Dwipada), Sri Venkataachala Mahatyam (Padya Prabhandam) and Ashtanga Yoga, Saram (Padyakruthi).\n\nTTD, focusing on the propagation of Lord Sri Venkateswara's Bhakti Tatva through the compositions of Annamacharya, Matrusri Tarigonda Vengamamba, Alwars and the Karnataka Haridasas, took up \"Vengamaamba Keerthanalu\" as one of its prestigious projects to compose and offer the rare works of Vengamaamba to the world of music and literature.\n\nSunitha was part of this prestigious project taken up by Sri Venkateswara Recording Project, which was established by TTD to group all its activities relating to recording. Apart from these compositions recorded by SVRP-TTD, Sunitha also rendered 7 keerthanas in the movie \"Vengamaamba\" directed by P. Udaya Bhaskar and music given by M.M. Keeravani.\n\n==== Naada Neerajanam, Tirumala Brahmotsavam ====\n\"Nada neerajanam\" is an oblation to lord in the form of performing one's own art form from Tirumala Graded artists. Artists from all over the world are invited to perform in Nadaneerajanam in a planned manner and offer their devotion to the lotus feet of Lord Venkateshwara through nadopasana(worship through music). They sing compositions of great saint poets, perform different traditional dance forms as a seva(worship) to \"Sakala kala bhushitudu Sri Venkateshwara Swamy varu\"(Lord Venkateshwara).\n\n\"Brahmotsavam\" is the most important annual f\u00eate celebrated at Sri Venkateswara Temple in Tirumala. During the festival, the Utsava-murti (processional deity) of the presiding deity Lord Venkateswara, along with his consorts Sridevi and Bhudevi, will be taken on a procession on different Vahanams on the streets(Madaveedulu) surrounding the temple.The celebration attracts pilgrims and tourists from all parts of India and across the world. It is a holy cleansing ceremony in honor of Lord Brahma, and the one at Tirumala is by far the largest.\n\nSunitha Upadrasta was blessed to perform quiet a few times on the divine stage Nada Neeraajanam, as well while performing unjal(swing) seva and one other divine experiences of singing for the lord during Brahmotsavam on the streets(Madaveedulu) surrounding the temple. She also anchored one of the rare new year celebrations in Tirumala chanting \"govinda naama\" on the eve of 31 December.\n\n==== Srivaari Sevalu ====\nEvery day is a festival day in Tirumala. On each specific day, the Lord of Lords blesses his devotees in a specific ritual during the week days. These rituals are categorized as weekly \"pujas\". Limited number of devotees are allowed to take part in these weekly sevas on the issuance of limited number of tickets. In an attempt to bring these weekly \"seva\" more closer to larger devotees, SVBC came up with a concept of performing the same weekly rituals as they get performed on Lord Venkateshwara's main deity on a replica \"set\" so that the recording could get aired in SVBC channel on every weekday. VISESHA PUJA (ON MONDAYS), ASHTADALA \u2013 PADA PADMAARADHANA (ON TUESDAYS), SAHASRA KALASABHISHEKAM (ON WEDNESDAYS), TIRUPPAVADA SEVA (ON THURSDAYS), POOLANGI SEVA (ON THURSDAYS), ABHISHEKAM (ON FRIDAYS)\n\nSunitha Upadrasta offered her vocals to Srivaari set sevalu program presented by SVBC for two of the weekly seva's and Srivaari sevalu samaahaaram song as well that goes with the lyrics \"Enni janmala punyamo neekinni sevalu cheyagaa\".\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Seva\n!Lyric\n|-\n|Friday \u2013 Abhishekam\n|Saptagiri shrunga mangala taranga divya gagana gangaa teerthamula\n|-\n|Tuesday \u2013 Ashtadala paadapadmaaraadhana\n|Managala karamaina prathi mangala vaaramuna\n|}\n\n==== Thyaagaraaja Utsavaalu ====\nTyagaraja Aradhana is the annual festival glorifying Telugu saint composer Tyagaraja. The festival is observed in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, primarily in Tiruvaiyaru, the place where Tyagaraja attained Samadhi.\n\nSunitha, at her very young age of 10 years, participated in Tyagaraja Aradhana Utsavalu along with her guru Sri Pemmaraju Surya Rao garu.\n\n==== Prashanthi Nilayam ====\nPrasanthi Nilayam, literally \"The Abode of Supreme Peace\", is the birthplace and the headquarter of the sacred mission of Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba. For His devotees, it is what Rome is to the Catholics and Mecca to the Muslims. For others, who step into this township out of curiosity or general interest, it is a seat of inner growth and learning that visitors describe as aweinspiring. Its draw lies in its power to nourish the soul and calm the mind. This sacred township welcomes thousands of spiritual seekers from every faith, and all corners of the globe each day, as they arrive to behold the sacred presence of Bhagawan Baba.\n\nSunitha presented devotional songs in the presence of Bhagawan on two different occasions. On Friday evening, 15 August 2008, She sang many light devotional songs and most of them were in Telugu. She was lost in the joy and ecstasy as she sang and Swami too was very happy listening to her. After she completed her planned quota of 6\u20137 songs, Swami asked her to sing some more. She sang one more and when Swami asked her to sing another, she seemed so very thrilled and happy. She also sang a Meera bhajan and finally concluded with Swami's bhajan, \"Giridhara Naagara Kunja Vihaari\" which everyone followed. Bhagawan had many words of encouragement for the singer and he very lovingly blessed her. The other concert in Prasanthi nilayam by Sunitha was on 19 November 2008 and this program too lasted for an hour.\n\n=== Acting ===\n\nSunitha played the lead role in her first short film ''Raagam'', directed by Sree Chaitu.

Annamayya Paataku Pattabhishekam after gaining its popularity was also aired in Star MAA TV channel.\n\n==== Vengamaamba Keerthanalu ====\nTarigonda Vengamamba was a poet and staunch devotee of Lord Venkateswara in the 18th century. Her first poem was Tarikonda Nrusimha Satakam and it was followed by Nrusimha Vilasa Katha, Siva Natakam and Balakrishna Natakam as Yakshaganam and Rajayogamrutha Saram, a Dwipada Kavyam, Vishnu Parijatham, Chenchu Natakam, Rukmini Natakam, Jala Krida Vilasam, Mukthi Kanthi Vilasam (all Yaksha Ganams), Gopi Natakam (Golla Kalapam-Yakshaganam), Rama Parinayam, Sri Bhagavatham, Sri Krishna Manjari, Tatva Keerthanalu and Vashista Ramayanam (Dwipada), Sri Venkataachala Mahatyam (Padya Prabhandam) and Ashtanga Yoga, Saram (Padyakruthi).\n\nTTD, focusing on the propagation of Lord Sri Venkateswara's Bhakti Tatva through the compositions of Annamacharya, Matrusri Tarigonda Vengamamba, Alwars and the Karnataka Haridasas, took up \"Vengamaamba Keerthanalu\" as one of its prestigious projects to compose and offer the rare works of Vengamaamba to the world of music and literature.\n\nSunitha was part of this prestigious project taken up by Sri Venkateswara Recording Project, which was established by TTD to group all its activities relating to recording. Apart from these compositions recorded by SVRP-TTD, Sunitha also rendered 7 keerthanas in the movie \"Vengamaamba\" directed by P. Udaya Bhaskar and music given by M.M. Keeravani.\n\n==== Naada Neerajanam, Tirumala Brahmotsavam ====\n\"Nada neerajanam\" is an oblation to lord in the form of performing one's own art form from Tirumala Graded artists. Artists from all over the world are invited to perform in Nadaneerajanam in a planned manner and offer their devotion to the lotus feet of Lord Venkateshwara through nadopasana(worship through music). They sing compositions of great saint poets, perform different traditional dance forms as a seva(worship) to \"Sakala kala bhushitudu Sri Venkateshwara Swamy varu\"(Lord Venkateshwara).\n\n\"Brahmotsavam\" is the most important annual f\u00eate celebrated at Sri Venkateswara Temple in Tirumala. During the festival, the Utsava-murti (processional deity) of the presiding deity Lord Venkateswara, along with his consorts Sridevi and Bhudevi, will be taken on a procession on different Vahanams on the streets(Madaveedulu) surrounding the temple.The celebration attracts pilgrims and tourists from all parts of India and across the world. It is a holy cleansing ceremony in honor of Lord Brahma, and the one at Tirumala is by far the largest.\n\nSunitha Upadrasta was blessed to perform quiet a few times on the divine stage Nada Neeraajanam, as well while performing unjal(swing) seva and one other divine experiences of singing for the lord during Brahmotsavam on the streets(Madaveedulu) surrounding the temple. She also anchored one of the rare new year celebrations in Tirumala chanting \"govinda naama\" on the eve of 31 December.\n\n==== Srivaari Sevalu ====\nEvery day is a festival day in Tirumala. On each specific day, the Lord of Lords blesses his devotees in a specific ritual during the week days. These rituals are categorized as weekly \"pujas\". Limited number of devotees are allowed to take part in these weekly sevas on the issuance of limited number of tickets. In an attempt to bring these weekly \"seva\" more closer to larger devotees, SVBC came up with a concept of performing the same weekly rituals as they get performed on Lord Venkateshwara's main deity on a replica \"set\" so that the recording could get aired in SVBC channel on every weekday. VISESHA PUJA (ON MONDAYS), ASHTADALA \u2013 PADA PADMAARADHANA (ON TUESDAYS), SAHASRA KALASABHISHEKAM (ON WEDNESDAYS), TIRUPPAVADA SEVA (ON THURSDAYS), POOLANGI SEVA (ON THURSDAYS), ABHISHEKAM (ON FRIDAYS)\n\nSunitha Upadrasta offered her vocals to Srivaari set sevalu program presented by SVBC for two of the weekly seva's and Srivaari sevalu samaahaaram song as well that goes with the lyrics \"Enni janmala punyamo neekinni sevalu cheyagaa\".\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Seva\n!Lyric\n|-\n|Friday \u2013 Abhishekam\n|Saptagiri shrunga mangala taranga divya gagana gangaa teerthamula\n|-\n|Tuesday \u2013 Ashtadala paadapadmaaraadhana\n|Managala karamaina prathi mangala vaaramuna\n|}\n\n==== Thyaagaraaja Utsavaalu ====\nTyagaraja Aradhana is the annual festival glorifying Telugu saint composer Tyagaraja. The festival is observed in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, primarily in Tiruvaiyaru, the place where Tyagaraja attained Samadhi.\n\nSunitha, at her very young age of 10 years, participated in Tyagaraja Aradhana Utsavalu along with her guru Sri Pemmaraju Surya Rao garu.\n\n==== Prashanthi Nilayam ====\nPrasanthi Nilayam, literally \"The Abode of Supreme Peace\", is the birthplace and the headquarter of the sacred mission of Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba. For His devotees, it is what Rome is to the Catholics and Mecca to the Muslims. For others, who step into this township out of curiosity or general interest, it is a seat of inner growth and learning that visitors describe as aweinspiring. Its draw lies in its power to nourish the soul and calm the mind. This sacred township welcomes thousands of spiritual seekers from every faith, and all corners of the globe each day, as they arrive to behold the sacred presence of Bhagawan Baba.\n\nSunitha presented devotional songs in the presence of Bhagawan on two different occasions. On Friday evening, 15 August 2008, She sang many light devotional songs and most of them were in Telugu. She was lost in the joy and ecstasy as she sang and Swami too was very happy listening to her. After she completed her planned quota of 6\u20137 songs, Swami asked her to sing some more. She sang one more and when Swami asked her to sing another, she seemed so very thrilled and happy. She also sang a Meera bhajan and finally concluded with Swami's bhajan, \"Giridhara Naagara Kunja Vihaari\" which everyone followed.

En route to [[Virginia]] in September 1861 for action in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern Theater]], Haskell married Rebecca Coles Singleton in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]]. She died on October 26, 1862, after the birth of a daughter six days earlier.\n\nThe First South Carolina Regiment initially saw significant action in 1862 at the [[Seven Days Battles]] and would play a major role in the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]] by repulsing six [[Union Army|Union]] assaults. On May 27, 1864, [[Martin Witherspoon Gary|Martin Gary]] promoted Haskell to [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] and placed him in charge of the 7th SC Cavalry in the brigade formerly commanded by [[Wade Hampton III]].\n\nHaskell was injured four times in the war, at the battles of [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]], [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]], [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]] and [[Battle of Darbytown Road|Darbytown Road]]. It was at Darbytown Road where he was most seriously injured after suffering a [[Head injury|shot to the head]] and losing the function of his left eye, but he managed to recover in time to participate in the [[Appomattox Campaign]]. Haskell was appointed by General [[Robert E. Lee|Lee]] to surrender the Confederate cavalry of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] at the [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]] on April 12, 1865.\n\n==Postbellum activities==\nAfter the war, in 1870, Haskell married Alice Van Yeveren Alexander, the sister of [[Edward Porter Alexander]].\n\nHaskell practiced law in South Carolina and was chosen in 1876 to be the chairman of the [[South Carolina Democratic Party|state Democratic party]] Executive Committee. His efforts were instrumental in the [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1876|gubernatorial election]] by uniting the party for the straightout cause to [[Redemption (United States history)|redeem]] the state from [[Radical Republican (USA)|Radical Republican]] rule during [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. Governor [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]] rewarded him for his dedication and fervor by having Haskell placed on the [[Supreme Court of South Carolina|state supreme court]] in 1877. In the 1880s, Haskell became the president of the [[Richmond and Danville Railroad|Columbia and Greenville Railroad]].\n\nHaskell and conservative Democrats were bitterly opposed to [[Benjamin Tillman|Ben Tillman's]] candidacy for [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1890|governor in 1890]]. Tillman was an uncouth [[Demagogy|demagogue]] who expressed his opposition to everything favored by the conservatives and further irritating Haskell was that while both men lost the function of an eye, Haskell courageously continued to serve in the Confederate army while Tillman dodged service.

En route to [[Virginia]] in September 1861 for action in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern Theater]], Haskell married Rebecca Coles Singleton in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]]. She died on October 26, 1862, after the birth of a daughter six days earlier.\n\nThe First South Carolina Regiment initially saw significant action in 1862 at the [[Seven Days Battles]] and would play a major role in the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]] by repulsing six [[Union Army|Union]] assaults. On May 27, 1864, [[Martin Witherspoon Gary|Martin Gary]] promoted Haskell to [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] and placed him in charge of the 7th SC Cavalry in the brigade formerly commanded by [[Wade Hampton III]].\n\nHaskell was injured four times in the war, at the battles of [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]], [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]], [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]] and [[Battle of Darbytown Road|Darbytown Road]]. It was at Darbytown Road where he was most seriously injured after suffering a [[Head injury|shot to the head]] and losing the function of his left eye, but he managed to recover in time to participate in the [[Appomattox Campaign]]. Haskell was appointed by General [[Robert E. Lee|Lee]] to surrender the Confederate cavalry of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] at the [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]] on April 12, 1865.\n\n==Postbellum activities==\nAfter the war, in 1870, Haskell married Alice Van Yeveren Alexander, the sister of [[Edward Porter Alexander]].\n\nHaskell practiced law in South Carolina and was chosen in 1876 to be the chairman of the [[South Carolina Democratic Party|state Democratic party]] Executive Committee. His efforts were instrumental in the [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1876|gubernatorial election]] by uniting the party for the straightout cause to [[Redemption (United States history)|redeem]] the state from [[Radical Republican (USA)|Radical Republican]] rule during [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. Governor [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]] rewarded him for his dedication and fervor by having Haskell placed on the [[Supreme Court of South Carolina|state supreme court]] in 1877. In the 1880s, Haskell became the president of the [[Richmond and Danville Railroad|Columbia and Greenville Railroad]].\n\nHaskell and conservative Democrats were bitterly opposed to [[Benjamin Tillman|Ben Tillman's]] candidacy for [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1890|governor in 1890]]. Tillman was an uncouth [[Demagogy|demagogue]] who expressed his opposition to everything favored by the conservatives and further irritating Haskell was that while both men lost the function of an eye, Haskell courageously continued to serve in the Confederate army while Tillman dodged service. Failing to beat Tillman at the state Democratic convention, Haskell led a straightout Democratic ticket in the general election and even appealed for votes from blacks and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]. Many in the state refused to vote for anyone other than the official Democratic candidate out of fear of giving Republicans another chance at state government and thus the Haskell ticket fared poorly.\n\nUntil his death on April 13, 1910, Haskell was serving as the [[vice president]] of National Loan & Exchange Bank of Columbia. He was buried in Columbia at Elmwood Cemetery.\n\n==Children==\nFrom his first marriage, to Rebecca Coles Singleton (1838\u20131862), Haskell had one daughter:\n* Rebecca Singleton Haskell (born June 20, 1862)\n\nHaskell had ten children from his marriage with Alice Van Yeveren Alexander (born 1848):\n*Alexander Cheves Haskell, Jr. (born August 15, 1871)\n*Louise Porter Haskell (born July 25, 1872)\n*[[Mary Haskell (educator)|Mary Elizabeth Haskell]] (December 11, 1873 \u2013 October 9, 1964)\n*Anthony Porter Haskell (born January 27, 1875)\n*Marion Alexander Haskell (born June 5, 1876)\n*Charles Thomson Haskell (born April 25, 1878)\n*Frederika Christina Haskell (born December 10, 1880)\n*Adam Leopold Haskell (born September 1, 1882)\n*Alice Van Yeveren Haskell (born June 21, 1884)\n*Suzanna Courtonne Haskell (born February 16, 1886)\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book | first = William Watts | last = Ball | title = The State That Forgot; South Carolina's Surrender to Democracy | year = 1932 | publisher = The Bobbs-Merrill Company | pages = 150, 158, 167, 222, 233}}\n*{{cite book | first = William J. | last = Cooper, Jr. | title = The Conservative Regime: South Carolina, 1877-1890 | year = 2005 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | isbn = 1-57003-597-0 | pages = 130\u2013131, 197, 202}}\n*{{cite book | first = Francis Butler | last = Simkins | title = The Tillman movement in South Carolina | year = 1964 | publisher = Duke University Press | pages = 120\u2013121, 127\u2013128, 130\u2013131, 134, 205}}\n*Stokes, Karen, ed. 2019.

His channel experienced substantial growth in popularity over the next two years and he reached 1 million subscribers in July 2012. Over time, his style of content diversified to include vlogs, comedy shorts, formatted shows, and music videos. \n\nKjellberg became the most-subscribed YouTuber on 15 August 2013 (being briefly surpassed in late 2013 by [[YouTube (channel)|YouTube Spotlight]]) and held the title until early 2019 when he [[PewDiePie vs T-Series|publicly vied for it]] with [[India]]n record label [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]], until the latter established a significant lead in April that year.

Due to this popularity, his coverage of [[indie game]]s has created an [[Oprah effect]], boosting sales for titles he plays.

[[Let's Play]] videos and comedic formatted shows. Kjellberg's channel was the [[List of most-subscribed YouTube channels|most-subscribed channel on YouTube]] for more than five years from 2013 to 2019.\n\nAfter registering his eponymous YouTube channel in 2010, Kjellberg primarily posted Let's Play videos of horror and action video games. His channel experienced substantial growth in popularity over the next two years and he reached 1 million subscribers in July 2012. Over time, his style of content diversified to include vlogs, comedy shorts, formatted shows, and music videos. \n\nKjellberg became the most-subscribed YouTuber on 15 August 2013 (being briefly surpassed in late 2013 by [[YouTube (channel)|YouTube Spotlight]]) and held the title until early 2019 when he [[PewDiePie vs T-Series|publicly vied for it]] with [[India]]n record label [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]], until the latter established a significant lead in April that year. From 29 December 2014 to 14 February 2017, Kjellberg had the [[List of most-viewed YouTube channels|most-viewed channel on YouTube]]. {{as of|2020|4|6}}, his channel has received over 104 million subscribers and 25 billion views, ranking as the second-most-subscribed and thirteenth-most-viewed channel on the platform, and the most-subscribed and most-viewed channel operated by an individual.\n\nKjellberg's popularity on YouTube has caused him to become one of the most noted online personalities. Due to this popularity, his coverage of [[indie game]]s has created an [[Oprah effect]], boosting sales for titles he plays. In 2016, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named him one of [[Time 100|the world's 100 most influential people]].\n\n== Early life and education ==\n[[File:Chalmers entrance.jpg|thumb|Kjellberg studied at Chalmers University of Technology]]\nKjellberg was born on 24 October 1989, in [[Gothenburg]], Sweden, where he was also raised.<ref name=Expressen1 /><ref name=Leskin2019>{{cite web|last=Leskin|first=Paige|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/pewdiepie-youtube-felix-kjellberg-life-career-controvery-2019-9|title=The career of PewDiePie, the controversial 30-year-old video creator who just returned to YouTube after a 30-day hiatus|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=5 March 2020|accessdate=4 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191219173542/https://www.businessinsider.com/pewdiepie-youtube-felix-kjellberg-life-career-controvery-2019-9|archive-date=10 September 2019}}\n*{{cite web|last=Leskin|first=Paige|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/pewdiepie-youtube-felix-kjellberg-life-career-controvery-2019-9|title=The career of PewDiePie, the controversial 29-year-old who says he's 'definitely' worth more than $20 million (original title)|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=10 September 2019|accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> He was born to Lotta Kristine Johanna ([[n\u00e9e]] Hellstrand, born 7 May 1958) and Ulf Christian Kjellberg (born 8 January 1957), and grew up with his older sister Fanny.<ref name=Rosengren2012/> His mother, a former [[Chief information officer|CIO]], was named the 2010 CIO of the Year in Sweden.<ref name=Rosengren2012>{{cite web |last=Rosengren |first=Lina |url=http://www.idg.se/2.1085/1.477094/han-hoppade-av-chalmers---blev-heltidskandis-pa-youtube |title=Han hoppade av Chalmers&nbsp;\u2013 blev heltidsk\u00e4ndis p\u00e5 Youtube |work=[[International Data Group|IDG.se]] |date=19 November 2012 |accessdate=21 November 2012 |language=Swedish |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121164838/http://www.idg.se/2.1085/1.477094/han-hoppade-av-chalmers---blev-heltidskandis-pa-youtube |archivedate=21 November 2012 }}</ref> His father is also a corporate executive.<ref name=Dewey2015/>\n\nDuring his childhood, Kjellberg was interested in art, and has detailed that he would draw popular video game characters such as [[Mario]] and [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], as well as play video games on his [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]].<ref name=\"Bio\">{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/pewdiepie-felix-kjellberg-112817|title=PewDiePie Biography|author=Biography.com Editors|date=28 November 2017|work=Biography|publisher=[[A&E Networks|A&E Television Networks]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181027232032/https://www.biography.com/people/pewdiepie-felix-kjellberg-112817|archive-date=27 October 2018|access-date=27 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=Parker2015/> During high school, he would skip classes to play video games at an Internet caf\u00e9 with friends.<ref name=Parker2015/> He then went on to pursue a degree in industrial economics and technology management at [[Chalmers University of Technology]], but left the university in 2011.<ref name=Johnsson2014/><ref name=Gallagher2013/> While it has been reported that he left Chalmers to focus on his YouTube career,<ref name=Gallagher2013>{{cite news |last=Gallagher |first=Paul |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/meet-felix-kjellberg--the-new-king-of-the-web-8947100.html |title=Meet Felix Kjellberg&nbsp;\u2013 the new 'King of the Web' |work=[[The Independent]]|date=15 November 2013 |accessdate=23 November 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131122212837/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/meet-felix-kjellberg--the-new-king-of-the-web-8947100.html |archivedate=22 November 2013 }}</ref> in 2017, Kjellberg clarified that he left because of his lack of interest in his course of study.
