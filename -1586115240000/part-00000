The city has also switched much of its heating source from coal to gas. 197 large coal-fired boilers and more than 600 smaller boilers were decommissioned. As of 2007, 85% of population used natural gas rather than coal for their heating. The [[State Environmental Protection Agency]] (SEPA) has forced many of the less-efficient smaller factories to close and enforced stricter standards for larger factories including mandating the installation of sulfur scrubbers.<ref name=popsci />\n\nSince 2006, the government has taken a series of measures to modify industrial structure and economic development mode. Relevant policies was issued such as emission thresholds of industrial pollution.

Now it has been listed as a model city for environmental protection in Shanxi Province. Linfen has paid a high cost for the improvement; the regional GDP dropped by RMB 36 billion and fiscal income decreased by RMB 7.2 billion.

The highest point in the prefecture is the main peak of Mount Huo, at {{convert|2347|m}}, and the lowest is in Xiangning County, at {{convert|385|m}}. Important rivers in the area include the Yellow, Fen, [[Tingshui River|Xinshui]] ({{lang|zh|\u6615\u6c34\u6cb3}}), [[Qin River|Qin]] ({{lang|zh|\u6c81\u6cb3}}), [[Hui River|Hui]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u6d4d\u6cb3}}), [[E River|E]] ({{lang|zh|\u9102\u6cb3}}), and [[Qingshui River (Shanxi)|Qingshui River]]s ({{lang|zh|\u6e05\u6c34\u6cb3}}).\n\nThe whole prefecture-level city features a great variety of terrain.

This led to a rapid expansion of loosely regulated private mines.

Substandard mines were closed.<ref name=cndaily />  Coal trucks were kept from entering the city, resulting in much less coal dust. The city has also switched much of its heating source from coal to gas. 197 large coal-fired boilers and more than 600 smaller boilers were decommissioned. As of 2007, 85% of population used natural gas rather than coal for their heating. The [[State Environmental Protection Agency]] (SEPA) has forced many of the less-efficient smaller factories to close and enforced stricter standards for larger factories including mandating the installation of sulfur scrubbers.<ref name=popsci />\n\nSince 2006, the government has taken a series of measures to modify industrial structure and economic development mode. Relevant policies was issued such as emission thresholds of industrial pollution. Over the last few years the Ministry of Environmental Protection has been closely monitoring Linfen's environment conditions. Now it has been listed as a model city for environmental protection in Shanxi Province. Linfen has paid a high cost for the improvement; the regional GDP dropped by RMB 36 billion and fiscal income decreased by RMB 7.2 billion.

The story of its founding closely resembles that of its neighbors along the railway such as [[Muenster, Texas|Muenster]]. In 1891, Anton and August Flusche arranged for transfer of {{convert|9300|acre|km2}} along the railway to found a new town, which they named after a local judge. They attracted several [[German people|German]] [[Catholic]] settlers in the following years.\n\nThe date of Lindsay's founding is officially recognized as March 25, 1892, when the first mass was held; however, Lindsay was not formally incorporated until 1959.\n\nThe city has maintained some German traditions, including an annual [[Oktoberfest]]. As is typical in the region, the main industries are farming, principally [[dairy farming]], and oil production.\n\n==Geography==\nLindsay is located near the geographic center of Cooke County at {{coord|33|38|N|97|13|W|region:US_type:city}} (33.6363, -97.2213).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is bordered to the east by the city of Gainesville, the [[county seat]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], Lindsay has a total area of {{convert|4.1|sqkm|order=flip}}, all land.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\n[[U.S. Route 82]] passes through the northern part of the city, leading east {{convert|5|mi|0}} to Gainesville and west {{convert|9|mi|0}} to [[Muenster, Texas|Muenster]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|align=left\n|1960= 236\n|1970= 435\n|1980= 581\n|1990= 610\n|2000= 788\n|2010= 1018\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=1113\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=February 18, 2020}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212221153/http://factfinder.census.gov/main.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-02-12|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=American FactFinder}}</ref> of 2000,  788 people, 267 households, and 220 families resided in the city.

Since the system was implemented during the 1993\u20131994 school year, Lindsay ISD has never been rated lower than Recognized (one of a handful of schools with such a distinction), having earned the Exemplary rating in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2007, and 2009 and the Recognized rating in 1994, 1995, 1996, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, and 2009. Further, Lindsay High School is a four-time Class A Lone Star Cup champion and 14-time UIL Academic Meet overall champion (twice in Class AA and 12 times in Class A), and the defending{{when|date=January 2018}} Class A champion in the UIL Academic Meet.\n\n<!--poorly written \"homer\" info ==Football==\nThe Lindsay Knights have been a formidable contender in the North Texas region since the team's inauguration in 1960. They went undefeated in district play in 1962 and earned a regional final bid following a 28-18 victory over Pickton in the bidistrict championship. The next year, the Knights finished as District and bidistrict champs again as they dashed to a 10-2 campaign that ended with a 24-14 loss to New Waverly at Regionals. The Knights would not advance that deep in the post season for another 19 years, in 1982. The 82' Black and White whipped Prosper 21-6 and Tenaha 14-0 in the playoffs, but were halted by Italy at Regions once again. Six seasons later, the 1988 Lindsay Knights came up just a single game away from playing for the state crown, falling to White Deer in the Semi-Finals. As for recent fortunes, Lindsay were Quarter Finalists in 09' and captured three straight Area crowns from 2010-12. They've advanced to the playoffs 18 times and, {{As of|2012|lc=y}}, held a 299-184-8 all-time record, making them 1A's 12th most prolific team of all time with a 61.71 winning %. They earned the program's 300th all time victory with 63-0 homecoming win over Trenton in 2013. In 2014 the Knights went 10-0 in the regular season but lost in the Area round to Normangee. The Knights were ranked 7th in the state.\n -->\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Handbook of Texas|id= hll44|name=Lindsay}}\n\n{{Cooke County, Texas}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cities in Cooke County, Texas]]\n[[Category:Cities in Texas]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n|name                     = Lindsay, Cooke County, Texas\n|official_name            =\n|settlement_type          = [[City (United States)|City]]\n|nickname                 = \n|motto                    =\n\n<!-- Images -->\n|image_skyline            = File:Lindsay June 2017 3 (United States Post Office).jpg\n|imagesize                = \n|image_caption            = United States Post Office in Lindsay\n|image_flag               = \n|image_seal               =\n\n<!-- Maps -->\n|image_map                = Cooke County Lindsay.svg\n|mapsize                  = 250px\n|map_caption              = Location within Cooke County\n|pushpin_map              = Texas\n|pushpin_label            = Lindsay\n|pushpin_map_caption      = Location within Texas\n\n<!-- Location -->\n|subdivision_type         = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n|subdivision_name         = United States\n|subdivision_type1        = [[U.S. state|State]]\n|subdivision_name1        = [[Texas]]\n|subdivision_type2        = [[List of counties in Texas|County]]\n|subdivision_name2        = [[Cooke County, Texas|Cooke]]\n|coordinates              = {{coord|33|38|N|97|13|W|region:US_type:city|display=inline,title}}\n|government_footnotes     = \n|government_type          = \n|leader_title             = Mayor\n|leader_name              = Scott Neu\n|leader_title1            = \n|leader_name1             = \n|established_title        = \n|established_date         =\n\n<!-- Area -->\n|unit_pref                =  Imperial\n|area_footnotes           =\n|area_magnitude           = \n|area_total_km2           = 4.09\n|area_land_km2            = 4.09\n|area_water_km2           = 0.0\n\n<!-- Population -->\n|population_as_of         = [[2010 United States Census|2010]]\n|population_footnotes     = \n|population_total         = 1018 \n|population_density_km2   = 248.9\n\n<!-- General information -->\n|timezone                 = [[North American Central Time Zone|Central (CST)]]\n|utc_offset               = -6\n|timezone_DST             = CDT\n|utc_offset_DST           = -5\n\n<!-- Area/postal codes & others -->\n|postal_code_type         = [[ZIP code]]\n|postal_code              = 79772\n|area_code                = [[Area code 940|940]]\n|blank_name               = [[Federal Information Processing Standards|FIPS code]]\n|blank_info               = 48-42868\n|blank1_name              = [[Geographic Names Information System|GNIS]] feature ID\n|blank1_info              = 2412901\n|website                  = http://lindsay.texas.gov/\n|footnotes                = \n}}\n\n'''Lindsay''' is a primarily German Catholic city in [[Cooke County, Texas]], United States, along [[U.S. Route 82]].

The story of its founding closely resembles that of its neighbors along the railway such as [[Muenster, Texas|Muenster]]. In 1891, Anton and August Flusche arranged for transfer of {{convert|9300|acre|km2}} along the railway to found a new town, which they named after a local judge. They attracted several [[German people|German]] [[Catholic]] settlers in the following years.\n\nThe date of Lindsay's founding is officially recognized as March 25, 1892, when the first mass was held; however, Lindsay was not formally incorporated until 1959.\n\nThe city has maintained some German traditions, including an annual [[Oktoberfest]]. As is typical in the region, the main industries are farming, principally [[dairy farming]], and oil production.\n\n==Geography==\nLindsay is located near the geographic center of Cooke County at {{coord|33|38|N|97|13|W|region:US_type:city}} (33.6363, -97.2213).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is bordered to the east by the city of Gainesville, the [[county seat]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], Lindsay has a total area of {{convert|4.1|sqkm|order=flip}}, all land.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\n[[U.S. Route 82]] passes through the northern part of the city, leading east {{convert|5|mi|0}} to Gainesville and west {{convert|9|mi|0}} to [[Muenster, Texas|Muenster]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|align=left\n|1960= 236\n|1970= 435\n|1980= 581\n|1990= 610\n|2000= 788\n|2010= 1018\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=1113\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=February 18, 2020}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212221153/http://factfinder.census.gov/main.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-02-12|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=American FactFinder}}</ref> of 2000,  788 people, 267 households, and 220 families resided in the city.

About 2.7% of families and 4.1% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 4.2% of those under age 18 and 6.9% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==Education==\nLindsay is served by the [[Lindsay Independent School District]], which has a strong record of academic success as evidenced by the Texas Education Agency accountability ratings system. Since the system was implemented during the 1993-1994 school year, Lindsay ISD has never been rated lower than Recognized (one of a handful of schools with such a distinction), having earned the Exemplary rating in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2007, and 2009 and the Recognized rating in 1994, 1995, 1996, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, and 2009. Further, Lindsay High School is a four-time Class A Lone Star Cup champion and 14-time UIL Academic Meet overall champion (twice in Class AA and 12 times in Class A), and the defending{{when|date=January 2018}} Class A champion in the UIL Academic Meet.\n\n<!--poorly written \"homer\" info ==Football==\nThe Lindsay Knights have been a formidable contender in the North Texas region since the team's inauguration in 1960. They went undefeated in district play in 1962 and earned a regional final bid following a 28-18 victory over Pickton in the bidistrict championship. The next year, the Knights finished as District and bidistrict champs again as they dashed to a 10-2 campaign that ended with a 24-14 loss to New Waverly at Regionals. The Knights would not advance that deep in the post season for another 19 years, in 1982. The 82' Black and White whipped Prosper 21-6 and Tenaha 14-0 in the playoffs, but were halted by Italy at Regions once again. Six seasons later, the 1988 Lindsay Knights came up just a single game away from playing for the state crown, falling to White Deer in the Semi-Finals.

The upper reaches of Coropuna consist of several [[wikt:perennially|perennially]] snowbound conical summits, lending it the name '''Nevado Coropuna''' in Spanish. The complex extends over an area of {{convert|240|km2|abbr=off}} and its highest summit reaches an altitude of {{convert|6377|m|abbr=off}} above sea level. This makes the Coropuna complex the [[List of mountains in Peru|third-highest of Peru]]. Its thick ice cap is the most extensive in Earth's [[Tropics|tropical zone]], with several [[Glacier morphology#Outlet Glaciers|outlet glaciers]] stretching out to lower altitudes. Below an elevation of {{convert|5000|m|abbr=off}}, there are various vegetation belts which include trees, [[peat bog]]s, grasses and also [[agricultural]] areas and [[pastures]].\n\nThe Coropuna complex consists of several [[stratovolcano]]s. These are composed chiefly of [[ignimbrite]]s{{efn|[[Volcanic ash|Ash]] flows{{sfn|Herrmann|Bucksch|2014|p=1513}}}} and [[lava flow]]s on a [[basement (geology)|basement]] formed by [[Middle Miocene]] ignimbrites and lava flows. The Coropuna complex has been active for at least five million years, with the bulk of the current cone having been formed during the [[Quaternary]].{{efn|The age of man, including [[Pleistocene]] and [[Holocene]].{{sfn|Herrmann|Bucksch|2014|p=2296}}}} Coropuna has had two or three [[Holocene]] eruptions {{nowrap|2,100 \u00b1 200}} and either {{nowrap|1,100 \u00b1 100}} or {{nowrap|700 \u00b1 200 years}} ago which generated lava flows, plus an additional eruption which may have taken place some 6,000&nbsp;years ago. Current activity occurs exclusively in the form of [[hot spring]]s.\n\nCoropuna is located {{convert|150|km|abbr=off}} northwest of the city of [[Arequipa]]. People have lived on the slopes of Coropuna for millennia. The mountain was regarded as sacred by the [[Inca Empire|Inca]] and several archaeological sites have been discovered there, including the Inca sites of [[Mawk'allaqta, Castilla|Maucallacta]] and [[Acchaymarca]]. The mountain was considered one of the most important Inca religious sites in their realm; human sacrifices were performed on its slopes, Coropuna forms part of many local legends and the mountain is worshiped to the present day.\n\nThe ice cap of Coropuna, which during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] (LGM) had expanded to over {{convert|500|km2|abbr=off}}, has been in [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|retreat since at least 1850]]. Estimates published in 2018 imply that the ice cap will persist until about 2120. The retreat of the Coropuna glaciers threatens the water supply of tens of thousands of people relying upon its [[Drainage basin|watershed]], and interaction between volcanic activity and glacial effects has generated [[mudflow]]s that could be hazardous to surrounding populations. Because of this, the Peruvian geological agency, [[INGEMMET]], monitors Coropuna and has published a hazard map for the volcano.\n\n== Name and etymology ==\nIn [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]], {{lang|qu|puna}} means \"plateau\", and {{lang|qu|coro}} is a common component of toponyms such as with [[Coro Coro, Bolivia]], though its etymology is unclear.<ref name=\"Holmer1960\" /> The name may mean {{lang|qu|Qoripuna}}, \"Puna of Gold\",<ref name=\"Trawick2003\" /> \"golden mountain\",<ref name=\"MINCETUR2019\" /> \"cold, snowy\" or \"cut off at the top\".<ref name=\"Wilson2009\" /> The name is also spelled {{lang|qu|Qhuru Puna}}.<ref name=\"Besom2010\" /> The mountain is also called Nevado Coropuna; \"Nevado\" is the Spanish word for

Annie Peck raised a banner saying \"Votes for Women\" on the summit she had ascended, which was slightly lower than the one reached by Bingham.<ref name=\"Smith2004\" /> This banner action was part of the [[women's suffrage]] campaigns that were taking place at that time, and meant to illustrate that women were just as capable as men of physical deeds.<ref name=\"Schultz2010\" /> Since then, other summits of the mountain have been ascended as well.<ref name=\"Hernandez2013\" />\n\nThe rugged area offers [[mountaineering]] opportunities.<ref name=\"MINCETUR2019\" /> Coropuna is normally ascended from Laguna Pallarcocha, from where a route along the western rib and glacier slopes leads up to a foresummit and then to the main summit. Along this way, a high camp can be set up at {{convert|5600|-|5800|m}} elevation. An ascent of Coropuna would normally be a three-day trip, and on the [[Grade (climbing)#International French adjectival system (IFAS)|French adjectival climbing scale]] the route is graded as Facile (F).

The upper reaches of Coropuna consist of several [[wikt:perennially|perennially]] snowbound conical summits, lending it the name '''Nevado Coropuna''' in Spanish. The complex extends over an area of {{convert|240|km2|abbr=off}} and its highest summit reaches an altitude of {{convert|6377|m|abbr=off}} above sea level. This makes the Coropuna complex the [[List of mountains in Peru|third-highest of Peru]]. Its thick ice cap is the most extensive in Earth's [[Tropics|tropical zone]], with several [[Glacier morphology#Outlet Glaciers|outlet glaciers]] stretching out to lower altitudes. Below an elevation of {{convert|5000|m|abbr=off}}, there are various vegetation belts which include trees, [[peat bog]]s, grasses and also [[agricultural]] areas and [[pastures]].\n\nThe Coropuna complex consists of several [[stratovolcano]]s. These are composed chiefly of [[ignimbrite]]s{{efn|[[Volcanic ash|Ash]] flows{{sfn|Herrmann|Bucksch|2014|p=1513}}}} and [[lava flow]]s on a [[basement (geology)|basement]] formed by [[Middle Miocene]] ignimbrites and lava flows. The Coropuna complex has been active for at least five million years, with the bulk of the current cone having been formed during the [[Quaternary]].{{efn|The age of man, including [[Pleistocene]] and [[Holocene]].{{sfn|Herrmann|Bucksch|2014|p=2296}}}} Coropuna has had two or three [[Holocene]] eruptions {{nowrap|2,100 \u00b1 200}} and either {{nowrap|1,100 \u00b1 100}} or {{nowrap|700 \u00b1 200 years}} ago which generated lava flows, plus an additional eruption which may have taken place some 6,000&nbsp;years ago. Current activity occurs exclusively in the form of [[hot spring]]s.\n\nCoropuna is located {{convert|150|km|abbr=off}} northwest of the city of [[Arequipa]]. People have lived on the slopes of Coropuna for millennia. The mountain was regarded as sacred by the [[Inca Empire|Inca]] and several archaeological sites have been discovered there, including the Inca sites of [[Mawk'allaqta, Castilla|Maucallacta]] and [[Acchaymarca]]. The mountain was considered one of the most important Inca religious sites in their realm; human sacrifices were performed on its slopes, Coropuna forms part of many local legends and the mountain is worshiped to the present day.\n\nThe ice cap of Coropuna, which during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] (LGM) had expanded to over {{convert|500|km2|abbr=off}}, has been in [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|retreat since at least 1850]]. Estimates published in 2018 imply that the ice cap will persist until about 2120. The retreat of the Coropuna glaciers threatens the water supply of tens of thousands of people relying upon its [[Drainage basin|watershed]], and interaction between volcanic activity and glacial effects has generated [[mudflow]]s that could be hazardous to surrounding populations. Because of this, the Peruvian geological agency, [[INGEMMET]], monitors Coropuna and has published a hazard map for the volcano.\n\n== Name and etymology ==\nIn [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]], {{lang|qu|puna}} means \"plateau\", and {{lang|qu|coro}} is a common component of toponyms such as with [[Coro Coro, Bolivia]], though its etymology is unclear.<ref name=\"Holmer1960\" /> The name may mean {{lang|qu|Qoripuna}}, \"Puna of Gold\",<ref name=\"Trawick2003\" /> \"golden mountain\",<ref name=\"MINCETUR2019\" /> \"cold, snowy\" or \"cut off at the top\".<ref name=\"Wilson2009\" /> The name is also spelled {{lang|qu|Qhuru Puna}}.<ref name=\"Besom2010\" /> The mountain is also called Nevado Coropuna; \"Nevado\" is the Spanish word for \"snowy\".{{sfn|Bromley|Hall|Rademaker|Todd|2011|p=305}} There is another volcano in the [[Andagua volcanic field|Andahua volcanic field]] which has the same name, but is completely separate.{{sfn|Cuber|Panajew|Ga\u0142a\u015b|2015|p=66}}\n\n== Geography and geomorphology ==\nCoropuna lies in the [[Andes]] of Peru,{{sfn|Bromley|Hall|Rademaker|Todd|2011|p=306}} on the border

the western summit today known as \"La Ni\u00f1a\" was apparently also significant.{{sfn|Zi\u00f3\u0142kowski|2008|p=154}}\n\nAnother important site associated with Coropuna is Acchaymarca, to the west of the mountain,{{sfn|Baca|Molak|Sobczyk|W\u0119gle\u0144ski|2014|p=2}} where about 280 Inca stone structures have been found.{{sfn|Baca|Molak|Sobczyk|W\u0119gle\u0144ski|2014|p=3}} It is likely that many pilgrims came there for ceremonies honouring the ''[[Apu (god)|apus]]'' of Coropuna and Solimana.{{sfn|Baca|Molak|Sobczyk|W\u0119gle\u0144ski|2014|p=8}}\n\n== Mythology, religion and legends ==\nIn the Inca Empire, Coropuna was a [[Sacred mountains|sacred mountain]],{{sfn|Sobczyk|2012|p=215}} especially for the people of [[Cotahuasi]].<ref name=\"MINCETUR2019\" /> It was regarded as the most important mountain deity (''[[apu (god)|apu]]'') of the southern region,<ref name=\"Ch\u00e1vez2001\" /> and the second-most important in the [[cosmology]] of the Andes.<ref name=\"Trawick2003\" /> The mountain was considered to be an abode of the dead{{sfn|Fourtan\u00e9|2001|p=16}} \u2013 a large village where holy people received the souls of the departed, who lived there in the afterlife.<ref name=\"Trawick2003\" />{{sfn|Fourtan\u00e9|2001|p=17}} In different mythologies Coropuna is instead the starting point for the deceased on a journey to [[Surimana]].{{sfn|Fourtan\u00e9|2001|p=17}} Sometimes Coropuna is seen as a male entity while Solimana volcano is seen as a female one.<ref name=\"Golte2004\" /> Local people continue to observe these ancient mortuary rites today.<ref name=\"Trawick2003\" /> \n\nAn enduring Franciscan influence from a colonial-era [[Cusco]] friary, the \"pious among today's Peruvian peasantry\" revere a \"Flying\" [[St Francis of Assisi]], who is believed to await the souls of the dead on top of Coropuna.<ref name=\"Lara2013\" /> Other poorly recorded legends are associated with Coropuna.{{sfn|Zi\u00f3\u0142kowski|2008|p=143}} One story narrates how a brother tried to deceive Coropuna and other mountains, and was turned into a deer.<ref name=\"Campos2018\" /> Another legend tells of a conflict between Coropuna and other local mountains against an interloping Inca.<ref name=\"Menaker2019\" /> A third story states that a troupe was transporting precious metals for Coropuna and Solimana when the animal leading it was shot by a hunter; the mountains then castrated the hunter.<ref name=\"Gose1986\" />\n\n== Climbing ==\nThe archaeological findings made on Coropuna indicate that the Inca may have reached the summit.<ref name=\"Echevarria1980\" /> [[Annie Peck]] and [[Hiram Bingham III]] each reached a summit of Coropuna in 1911; Annie Peck raised a banner saying \"Votes for Women\" on the summit she had ascended, which was slightly lower than the one reached by Bingham.<ref name=\"Smith2004\" /> This banner action was part of the [[women's suffrage]] campaigns that were taking place at that time, and meant to illustrate that women were just as capable as men of physical deeds.<ref name=\"Schultz2010\" /> Since then, other summits of the mountain have been ascended as well.<ref name=\"Hernandez2013\" />\n\nThe rugged area offers [[mountaineering]] opportunities.<ref name=\"MINCETUR2019\" /> Coropuna is normally ascended from Laguna Pallarcocha, from where a route along the western rib and glacier slopes leads up to a foresummit and then to the main summit. Along this way, a high camp can be set up at {{convert|5600|-|5800|m}} elevation. An ascent of Coropuna would normally be a three-day trip, and on the [[Grade (climbing)#International French adjectival system (IFAS)|French adjectival climbing scale]] the route is graded as Facile (F).

However, Ravaisson developed his doctrine as what he called \u2018spiritualist realism\u2019 and \u2018spiritualist positivism\u2019, and - according to Ravaisson scholar [[Mark Sinclair (philosopher)|Mark Sinclair]] - can be thought of as founding 'the school of contingency'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9-10\">\"Sinclair (2019), pp. 9-10</ref> His most well known and influential successor was [[Henri Bergson]], with whom the tradition can be seen to end during the 1930s;<ref name=\"SinclairBI-1\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 1</ref> although the 'lineage' of this 'philosophy of life' can be seen to return in the late twentieth century with [[Gilles Deleuze]].<ref name=\"GroszHT-219\">\"Grosz (2013), p. 219</ref> Ravaisson never worked in the French state university system, in his late 20s declining a position at the University of Rennes.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-7\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 7</ref> In 1838 he was employed as the principle private secretary to the Minister of Public Instruction, going on to secure high-ranking positions such as Inspector General of Libraries, and then the Curator of Classical Antiquities at the [[Louvre]].<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> Later in his life he was appointed as the President of the Jury of the Aggregation of philosophy in France, 'a position of considerable influence'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 9</ref> Ravaisson, was not only a philosopher, classicist, archivist, and educational administrator, but also a painter exhibiting under the name Lach\u00e9.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> \n\n==Biography==\n\n[[File:Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau - Portrait of Jean-Gaspard-F\u00e9lix Larcher Ravaisson-Mollien.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A portrait of F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau.|F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau (1846)]]\n\nRavaisson was born at [[Namur]]. After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson\u2019s 'complete' 'three major' philosophical works are: ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d\u2019Aristote'' [Vol. 1 & Vol. 2] (1837 and 1846); ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''On Habit'', 1838); and ''Rapport sur la philosophie en France au XIXeme si\u00e8cle'' (1867).<ref name=\"SinclairBI-6\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 6</ref><ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-4-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), pp. 4-5</ref> Ravaisson also produced a number of other 'noteworthy essays' such as \"La Philosophie contemporaine\" (\"Contemporary Philosophy\", 1840); \"La Philosophie de Pascale\" (\"Pascal\u2019s Philosophy\", 1887), and \"M\u00e9taphysique et Morale\" (\"Metaphysics and Morals\", 1893).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref> Upon his death he also 'left unfinished fragments of a major work, which were published posthumously', first as \"Testament philosophique\" in ''Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale'' (\"Philosophical Testament\", 1901), then later in extended form as ''Testament philosophique'' (''Philosophical Testament'', 1933).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref><ref name=\"SinclairI-vii\">\"Sinclair (2016), p. vii</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!

However, Ravaisson developed his doctrine as what he called \u2018spiritualist realism\u2019 and \u2018spiritualist positivism\u2019, and - according to Ravaisson scholar [[Mark Sinclair (philosopher)|Mark Sinclair]] - can be thought of as founding 'the school of contingency'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9-10\">\"Sinclair (2019), pp. 9-10</ref> His most well known and influential successor was [[Henri Bergson]], with whom the tradition can be seen to end during the 1930s;<ref name=\"SinclairBI-1\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 1</ref> although the 'lineage' of this 'philosophy of life' can be seen to return in the late twentieth century with [[Gilles Deleuze]].<ref name=\"GroszHT-219\">\"Grosz (2013), p. 219</ref> Ravaisson never worked in the French state university system, in his late 20s declining a position at the University of Rennes.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-7\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 7</ref> In 1838 he was employed as the principle private secretary to the Minister of Public Instruction, going on to secure high-ranking positions such as Inspector General of Libraries, and then the Curator of Classical Antiquities at the [[Louvre]].<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> Later in his life he was appointed as the President of the Jury of the Aggregation of philosophy in France, 'a position of considerable influence'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 9</ref> Ravaisson, was not only a philosopher, classicist, archivist, and educational administrator, but also a painter exhibiting under the name Lach\u00e9.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> \n\n==Biography==\n\n[[File:Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau - Portrait of Jean-Gaspard-F\u00e9lix Larcher Ravaisson-Mollien.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A portrait of F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau.|F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau (1846)]]\n\nRavaisson was born at [[Namur]]. After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson\u2019s 'complete' 'three major' philosophical works are: ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d\u2019Aristote'' [Vol. 1 & Vol. 2] (1837 and 1846); ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''On Habit'', 1838); and ''Rapport sur la philosophie en France au XIXeme si\u00e8cle'' (1867).<ref name=\"SinclairBI-6\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 6</ref><ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-4-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), pp. 4-5</ref> Ravaisson also produced a number of other 'noteworthy essays' such as \"La Philosophie contemporaine\" (\"Contemporary Philosophy\", 1840); \"La Philosophie de Pascale\" (\"Pascal\u2019s Philosophy\", 1887), and \"M\u00e9taphysique et Morale\" (\"Metaphysics and Morals\", 1893).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref> Upon his death he also 'left unfinished fragments of a major work, which were published posthumously', first as \"Testament philosophique\" in ''Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale'' (\"Philosophical Testament\", 1901), then later in extended form as ''Testament philosophique'' (''Philosophical Testament'', 1933).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref><ref name=\"SinclairI-vii\">\"Sinclair (2016), p. vii</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!

The solitary Democrat to win a majority of the county's vote since [[American Civil War|the Civil War]] has been [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in his 1932 landslide triumph over [[Herbert Hoover]]. Apart from that and the 1912 election when Woodrow Wilson won against a mortally divided Republican Party, Livingston has always voted Republican since that party was founded in 1856. Since 1940, only [[Lyndon Johnson]] in his 1964 landslide victory over the conservative [[Barry Goldwater]] has won more than forty percent of the county's vote.\n\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential elections results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential elections results'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|first=David|last=Leip|date=|website=uselectionatlas.org}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

Livingston is located {{convert|7|mi|km|0}} west-northwest of [[Atwater, California|Atwater]],<ref name=CGN>{{California's Geographic Names|795}}</ref> at an elevation of 131 feet (40 m).<ref name=gnis /> According to the 2010 census, the city population was 13,058, up from 10,473 at the 2000 census.  Livingston's total area is {{convert|3.7|sqmi|km2}}, including undeveloped farmland annexed in anticipation of future growth.\n\n== Location ==\n\nLivingston is located at {{Coord|37|23|13|N|120|43|25|W|type:city}}.<ref name=gnis /> It lies slightly uphill from where the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] crosses the [[Merced River]]. [[California State Route 99|Highway 99]] follows the Southern Pacific through the city.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Livingston post office opened in 1873, closed in 1882, and re-opened in 1883.<ref name=CGN /> The town was named for Dr. David Livingstone, a British explorer of Africa who was an international celebrity in the late 1800s.

Like the rest of the valley, it has long, dry summers and depends on irrigation water. The winters are mild, alternating between fog, rain, and sun, with occasional frost. The growing season is long, and there is a low risk of mold, drought, or bad weather interfering with crops. Due to deposits from the [[Merced River]], Livingston's soil is unusually sandy, distinguishing it from the [[San Joaquin (soil)|clay-based soils]] predominant in most of the valley.\n\nLivingston and Merced County are a center of the [[agribusiness|agriculture industry]]. Livingston's largest businesses are agriculture-related. Among these are the largest [[poultry]] producer in the western United States, [[Foster Farms (poultry company)|Foster Farms]], and a dairy, [[Joseph Gallo Farms]], which owns the largest dairy herd in the United States.<ref name=\"econ\">{{cite web|url=http://www.livingstoncity.com/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&SEC={D0F9CCE5-A54E-469C-B3D4-85E53E9B1DF9}&DE=|title=Livingston California - City Economic and Fiscal Trends|publisher=City of Livingston|accessdate=2009-07-13}}</ref> Ninety percent of the [[sweet potatoes]] grown west of the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] are grown and packed in and around Livingston.<ref name=\"econ\" /> The sweet potatoes benefit from the sandy soil.

[[E & J Gallo Winery]] operates a major grape-[[pressing (wine)|pressing]] facility just outside the city.<ref name=\"econ\" />  [[Almond]] orchards are a common sight, and the Central Valley is a key part of California's production of this crop (California produces 100% of the US domestic supply of almonds, and 80% of the world's supply<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.almonds.com/pdfs/california-almond-industry-facts.pdf|title=California Almond Industry Facts|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>).

Most elementary-age children are within walking distance of each school. All three elementary schools offer some form of [[Dual language|two-way immersion]] instruction designed to build proficiency in both [[English language|English]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. [[Livingston Middle School]] serves grades 6\u20138.\n\n[[Livingston High School (California)|Livingston High School]] is part of [[Merced Union High School District]] and serves all of Livingston as well as students from the nearby towns of [[Ballico, California|Ballico]] and [[Cressey, California|Cressey]]. In years past, most students from Delhi attended Livingston High School until Delhi opened its own high school, Delhi High School, in 1998. Livingston High School's foreign language department offers classes in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]].\n\n[[Longview Mennonite School]] serves many Mennonite students in the area.\n\nIn the 1990s, Livingston schools were at the center of a controversy involving Sikh students' right to wear ceremonial daggers known as [[kirpan]]s under clothing while at school. In 1995, a Federal appellate court affirmed the right to wear the kirpan if certain safety precautions are followed.<ref>[http://openjurist.org/36/f3d/1102/cheema-v-h-thompson ''Cheema v.

Like the rest of the valley, it has long, dry summers and depends on irrigation water. The winters are mild, alternating between fog, rain, and sun, with occasional frost. The growing season is long, and there is a low risk of mold, drought, or bad weather interfering with crops. Due to deposits from the [[Merced River]], Livingston's soil is unusually sandy, distinguishing it from the [[San Joaquin (soil)|clay-based soils]] predominant in most of the valley.\n\nLivingston and Merced County are a center of the [[agribusiness|agriculture industry]]. Livingston's largest businesses are agriculture-related. Among these are the largest [[poultry]] producer in the western United States, [[Foster Farms (poultry company)|Foster Farms]], and a dairy, [[Joseph Gallo Farms]], which owns the largest dairy herd in the United States.<ref name=\"econ\">{{cite web|url=http://www.livingstoncity.com/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&SEC={D0F9CCE5-A54E-469C-B3D4-85E53E9B1DF9}&DE=|title=Livingston California - City Economic and Fiscal Trends|publisher=City of Livingston|accessdate=2009-07-13}}</ref> Ninety percent of the [[sweet potatoes]] grown west of the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] are grown and packed in and around Livingston.<ref name=\"econ\" /> The sweet potatoes benefit from the sandy soil.

In years past, most students from Delhi attended Livingston High School until Delhi opened its own high school, Delhi High School, in 1998. Livingston High School's foreign language department offers classes in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]].\n\n[[Longview Mennonite School]] serves many Mennonite students in the area.\n\nIn the 1990s, Livingston schools were at the center of a controversy involving Sikh students' right to wear ceremonial daggers known as [[kirpan]]s under clothing while at school. In 1995, a Federal appellate court affirmed the right to wear the kirpan if certain safety precautions are followed.<ref>[http://openjurist.org/36/f3d/1102/cheema-v-h-thompson ''Cheema v.

The borough was founded by [[royal charter]] in 1207 by King John, was made up of only seven streets in the shape of the letter 'H' but Liverpool remained a small settlement until its trade with [[Ireland]] and coastal parts of England and Wales was overtaken by trade with [[Africa]] and the [[West Indies]], which included the [[slave trade]].  The world's first [[wet dock]] was opened in 1715 and Liverpool's expansion to become a major city continued over the next two centuries.\n\nBy the start of the nineteenth century, a large volume of trade was passing through [[Liverpool]]. In 1830, the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] was opened. The population grew rapidly, especially with [[Irish diaspora|Irish]] migrants; by 1851, one quarter of the city's population was Irish-born.  As growth continued, the city became known as \"the second city of the [[British Empire|Empire]]\", and was also called \"the [[New York City|New York]] of Europe\".  During the Second World War, the city was the centre for planning the crucial [[Battle of the Atlantic]], and suffered a [[Liverpool Blitz|blitz]] second only to London's.\n\nFrom the mid-twentieth century, Liverpool's docks and traditional [[manufacturing industries]] went into sharp decline, with the advent of [[containerisation]] making the city's docks obsolete.  The [[unemployment rate]] in Liverpool rose to one of the highest in the UK. Over the same period, starting in the early 1960s, the city became internationally renowned for its culture, particularly as the centre of the \"[[Merseybeat]]\" sound which became synonymous with [[The Beatles]]. In recent years, Liverpool's economy has recovered, partly due to tourism as well as substantial investment in [[Urban regeneration|regeneration]] schemes.  The city was the [[European Capital of Culture]] for 2008.\n\n==Origins of the name==\nThe name comes from the Old English ''liver'', meaning thick or muddy, and ''pol'', meaning a pool or creek, and is first recorded around 1190 as ''Liuerpul''.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Hanks, Patrick|author2=Hodges, Flavia|author3=Mills, David|author4=Room, Adrian|title=The Oxford Names Companion|date=2002|location=Oxford|publisher=the University Press|isbn=0198605617|page=1110}}</ref><ref name=DH>{{cite web|title=Liverpool|publisher=The Online Etymology Dictionary|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=Liverpool|last=Harper|first=Douglas}}</ref> According to the ''Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names'', \"The original reference was to a pool or tidal creek now filled up into which two streams drained\".<ref name=DH/> The adjective ''Liverpudlian'' is first recorded in 1833.<ref name=DH/>\n\n==Early history of the area==\n[[File:The Calder Stones, Calderstones Park - geograph.org.uk - 40880.jpg|thumbnail|right|The ancient neolithic Calder Stones on display in the Harthill Greenhouses]]\nIn the [[Iron Age]] the area around modern-day Liverpool was sparsely populated, though there was a seaport at [[Meols]]. The [[Calderstones Park|Calderstones]] are thought to be part of an ancient [[stone circle]] and there is archaeological evidence for native Iron Age farmsteads at several sites in [[Irby, Merseyside|Irby]], [[Halewood]] and [[Lathom]]. The region was inhabited by [[Britons (Celtic people)|Brythonic]] tribes, the [[Setantii]] as well as nearby [[Cornovii (Midlands)|Cornovii]] and [[Deceangli]]. It came under Roman influence in about 70 AD, with the northward advance to crush the [[druid]] resistance at [[Anglesey]] and to end the internal strife between the ruling family of [[Brigantes]]. The main Roman presence was at the fortress and settlement at [[Chester]]. According to [[Ptolemy]], the Latin hydronym for the [[Mersey]] was ''Seteia Aestuarium'', which derives from the Setantii tribe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/exhibitions/livingwithromans/ancestors.aspx|work=Museum of Liverpool|title=Our ancestors and the Roman invasion|accessdate=2 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsBritain/BritainCornovii.htm|work=The History Files|title=Celtic kingdoms of the British Isles|accessdate=3 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, evidence of a Roman Tile works was found around the [[Tarbock]] Island area of the M62 and various Roman coins and Jewellery have been found in the Liverpool area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://historyofliverpool.com/roman-liverpool/|title=Roman Liverpool|website=History of Liverpool|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-06}}</ref>\n\nAfter the withdrawal of Roman troops, land in the area continued to be farmed by native [[Britons (Celtic people)|Britons]]. The [[Hen Ogledd]] (Old North) was subject to fighting between four medieval kingdoms: the Anglo-Saxon [[Kingdom of Mercia]] eventually defeated its rival [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]] as well as the Celtic kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]] and [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]], with the [[Battle of Brunanburh]] perhaps taking place at nearby [[Bromborough]]. The settlements at [[Walton, Liverpool|Walton]] (''Wealas tun'' meaning 'farmstead of the [[Walhaz|Wealas]]'), and [[Wallasey]] (''Wealas-eg'' meaning 'island of the Wealas') were named at this time with ''Wealas'' being [[Old English]] for 'foreigner' referring to the native [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Romano-British culture|Romanized inhabitants]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Eilert|last=Ekwall|authorlink=Eilert Ekwall|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names|publisher=OUP|year=1936}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Wales|title=Wales|work=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe pseudo-historical ''[[Fragmentary Annals of Ireland]]'' appears to record the Norse settlement of the [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]] in its account of the immigration of [[Ingimundr (tenth century)|Ingimundr]] near Chester.

Ferguson Irvine's conjectural plan of Liverpool's original 7 streets]]\n[[File:Westderbycastle.gif|alt=West Derby Castle shown where it used to stand.|thumb|West Derby Castle shown where it used to stand. (circa 1200)]]\nAlthough a small [[motte and bailey]] castle had earlier been built by the Normans at [[West Derby]], the origins of the city of Liverpool are usually dated from 28 August 1207, when [[letters patent]] were issued by [[John of England|King John]] advertising the establishment of a new borough, \"Livpul\", and inviting settlers to come and take up holdings there. It is thought that the King wanted a port in the district that was free from the control of the [[Earl of Chester]]. Initially it served as a dispatch point for troops sent to Ireland, soon after the building around 1235 of [[Liverpool Castle]], which was removed in 1726. [[Church of Our Lady and Saint Nicholas, Liverpool|St Nicholas Church]] was built by 1257, originally as a chapel within the parish of [[Walton, Merseyside|Walton-on-the-Hill]].<ref name=Belchem>{{cite book|editor-first=John|editor-last=Belchem|title=Liverpool 800: Culture, Character & History|year=2006|isbn=1-84631-035-0}}</ref> In the 13th Century, Liverpool as an area comprised just seven streets.\n\nWith the formation of a market on the site of the later Town Hall, Liverpool became established as a small fishing and farming community, administered by [[burgess (title)|burgesses]] and, slightly later, a mayor. There was probably some coastal trade around the [[Irish Sea]], and there were occasional ferries across the Mersey. However, for several centuries it remained a small and relatively unimportant settlement, with a population of no more than 1,000 in the mid 14th century. By the early fifteenth century a period of economic decline set in, and the county gentry increased their power over the town, the [[John I Stanley of the Isle of Man|Stanley]] family fortifying their house by building Stanley Tower on Water Street. This was a catalyst for a feud between the Stanley and [[Earl of Sefton|Molyneux]] families since the Molyneux family had permission to live at the nearby [[Liverpool Castle]] at that time. The resulting rivalry nearly spilled into a riot in 1424.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historyofliverpool.com/liverpool-molyneux-stanley-family-history/|title=Text only version of our interactive Liverpool Molyneux Stanley family history page.|work=The History of Liverpool|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref> In the middle of the 16th century the population of Liverpool had fallen to around 600, and the port was regarded as subordinate to [[Chester, England|Chester]] until the 1650s.\n\n==Elizabethan era and the Civil War==\n[[File:Liverpool.1572.jpg|thumb|Liverpool in 1572.]]\nIn 1571 the people of Liverpool sent a memorial to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]], praying relief from a subsidy which they thought themselves unable to bear, wherein they styled themselves \"''her majesty's poor decayed town of Liverpool.''\" Some time towards the close of this reign, [[Henry Stanley, 4th Earl of Derby]], on his way to the [[Isle of Man]], stayed at his house, the Tower; at which the corporation erected a handsome hall or seat for him in the church, where he honoured them several times with his presence.\n\nBy the end of the sixteenth century, the town began to be able to take advantage of economic revival and the silting of the [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]] to win trade, mainly from Chester, to Ireland, the Isle of Man and elsewhere. In 1626, King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] gave the town a new and improved charter.<ref name=Belchem />\n[[File:Liverpool.1650.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Liverpool in 1650.]]\n\nIn June 1644 [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]] arrived in Liverpool with 10,000 men in an attempt to capture [[Liverpool Castle]]. A sixteen-day siege of Liverpool then took place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historyofliverpool.com/civil-war-siege-liverpool/|title=Civil War Siege of Liverpool|work=The History of Liverpool|accessdate=25 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180403112400/http://historyofliverpool.com/civil-war-siege-liverpool/|archive-date=3 April 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> To defend the city the [[New Model Army|Parliament Army]] created a huge trench across much of the town centre. Prince Rupert eventually took hold of the Castle only to be driven out again to take refuge in the Everton area of the city, hence the name of the tower found on the modern day Everton Football Club badge is known as [[Everton Lock-Up|Prince Rupert's Tower]].\n\n==Transatlantic trade==\nThe first cargo from the Americas was recorded in 1648. The development of the town accelerated after the Restoration of 1660, with the growth of trade with America and the [[West Indies]]. From that time may be traced the rapid progress of population and commerce, until Liverpool had become the second metropolis of Great Britain. Initially, cloth, coal and salt from Lancashire and Cheshire were exchanged for sugar and tobacco; the town's first sugar refinery was established in 1667.<ref>http://www.mawer.clara.net/loc-liverpool.html</ref>\n\nIn 1699 Liverpool was made a [[parish]] on its own by [[Act of Parliament]], separate from that of Walton-on-the-Hill, with two parish churches. At the same time it gained separate customs authority from Chester.<ref name=\"Belchem\" />\n\n==Slavery==\nOn 3 October 1699, the very same year that Liverpool had been granted status as an independent parish, Liverpool's first 'recorded' [[slave ship]], named ''Liverpool Merchant'', set sail for Africa, arriving in Barbados with a 'cargo' of 220 Africans, returning to Liverpool on 18 September 1700. The following month a second recorded ship, ''The Blessing'', set sail for the Gold Coast.\n\nThe first commercial [[wet dock]] in Britain was built in Liverpool and completed in 1715. It was the first in the world and was constructed for a capacity of 100 ships. By the close of the 18th century 40% of the world's, and 80% of Britain's Atlantic slave activity was accounted for by slave ships that voyaged from the [[:Category:Liverpool docks|docks at Liverpool]]. This growth led to the opening of the [[Consulate of the United States in Liverpool]] in 1790, its first consulate anywhere in the world.\n\nVast profits from the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]] transformed Liverpool into one of Britain's foremost important cities. Liverpool became a financial centre, rivalled by Bristol, another slaving port, and beaten only by London. In the peak year of 1799, ships sailing from Liverpool carried over 45,000 slaves from Africa.<ref name=Belchem />\n\nMany factors led to the demise of slavery including revolts, piracy, social unrest, and the repercussions of corruption such as slave insurance fraud, e.g. the [[Zong Massacre|''Zong'' massacre]] case in 1783. It was Liverpool born politician [[William Roscoe]] who spearheaded the anti-Slavery movement in parliament at the time.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Liverpool Slave Trade |publisher=History of Liverpool |url=http://historyofliverpool.com/liverpool-slave-trade/ |accessdate=28  February 2015}}</ref>\n\nSlavery in British colonies was finally abolished in 1833 and slave trading was made illegal in 1807 though some slavery apprenticeships ran until 1838.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/localhistory/journey/american_connection/slavery/timeline.shtml|work=BBC|title=Liverpool Local History - American Connections - Slavery Timeline|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref> However, many merchants managed to ignore the laws and continued to deal in underground slave trafficking, also underhandedly engaging in financial investments for slaving activities in the Americas.\n\n==Industrial revolution and commercial expansion==\n{{Gallery\n| title        = 19th Century Liverpool\n| align        =\n| footer       =\n| style        =\n| state        =\n| height       =\n| width        =\n| captionstyle =\n| File:Cunard Line New York Liverpool 1875.jpg\n | alt1= [[Cunard Line]] est. 1840, poster 1875\n | [[Cunard Line]] est. 1840, poster 1875\n|File:George's Dock 1897.jpg\n|alt2=[[George's Dock]] opened 1771, closed 1899, photo 1897\n|[[George's Dock]] opened 1771, closed 1899, photo 1897\n|File:Seaforth Sands railway station 1.jpg\n|alt3=[[Liverpool Overhead Railway]]\n|[[Liverpool Overhead Railway]] [[Seaforth Sands railway station]] opened 1894, railway opened 1893, photo 1951\n|File:White Star Offices, Liverpool.jpg\n|alt4=[[White Star Line]] offices, 1890s\n|[[White Star Line]] offices, 1890s\n|File:Roscoe GJR(1839) p155 - Entrance to the Railway Station at Liverpool.jpg\n|alt5=[[Liverpool Lime Street Station]] opening 1839\n|[[Liverpool Lime Street Station]] opening 1839\n|File:Liverpool1890s.jpg\n|alt6=Colourised photo taken in the 1890s.

Liverpool was first linked by canal to Manchester in 1721, the [[St Helens, Merseyside|St. Helens]] coalfield in 1755, and Leeds in 1816. In 1830, Liverpool became home to the world's first inter-urban rail link to another city, [[Manchester]], through the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] and the maiden journey Stephenson's [[Stephenson's Rocket|The Rocket]] train.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://historyofliverpool.com/ks3-history-railways/ |title = KS3 History Railways|work=The History of Liverpool|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nLiverpool's importance was such that it was home to a number of world firsts, including gaining the world's first fully electrically powered overhead railway, the [[Liverpool Overhead Railway]], which was opened in 1893 and so pre-dated those in both [[New York City]] and [[Chicago]].\n\nThe built-up area grew rapidly from the eighteenth century on. The [[Liverpool Blue Coat School|Bluecoat Hospital]] for poor children opened in 1718. With the demolition of the castle in 1726, only [[Church of Our Lady and Saint Nicholas, Liverpool|St Nicholas Church]] and the historic street plan - with Castle Street as the spine of the original settlement, and [[Paradise Street, Liverpool|Paradise Street]] following the line of the Pool - remained to reflect the town's mediaeval origins. The Town Hall, with a covered exchange for merchants designed by architect [[John Wood, the Elder|John Wood]], was built in 1754, and the first office buildings including the Corn Exchange were opened in about 1810.\n\nThroughout the 19th century Liverpool's trade and its population continued to expanded rapidly. Growth in the cotton trade was accompanied by the development of strong trading links with India and the Far East following the ending of the [[Honourable East India Company|East India Company's]] monopoly in 1813. Over {{convert|140|acre|km2}} of new docks, with {{convert|10|mi|km}} of quay space, were opened between 1824 and 1858.<ref name=Belchem />\n\n[[File:Situationsplan von Liverpool.jpg|thumb|Map of Liverpool from 1880]]\nDuring the 1840s, [[Irish diaspora|Irish]] migrants began arriving by the thousands due to the [[Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849)|Great Famine]] of 1845\u20131849. Almost 300,000 arrived in the year 1847 alone, and by 1851 approximately 25% of the city was Irish-born. The Irish influence is reflected in the unique place Liverpool occupies in UK and Irish political history, being the only place outside Ireland to elect a member of parliament from the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] to the British parliament in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]]. [[T.P. O'Connor]] represented the constituency of [[Liverpool Scotland (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Scotland]] from 1885 to 1929.\n\nAs the town became a leading port of the [[British Empire]], a number of major buildings were constructed, including [[St. George\u2019s Hall, Liverpool|St. George's Hall]] (1854), and [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Lime Street Station]].

The prevalence of cotton and slave interests in Liverpool ensured that the city was, in the words of the historian [[Sven Beckert]], \"the most pro-Confederate place in the world outside the Confederacy itself.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = Empire of Cotton: a Global History|last = Beckert|first = Sven|publisher = Knopf|year = 2014|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}</ref> The [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] Navy ship, the [[CSS Alabama|CSS ''Alabama'']], was built at [[Birkenhead]] on the Mersey and the [[CSS Shenandoah|CSS ''Shenandoah'']] surrendered there (being the final surrender and end of the war).\n\nLiverpool was granted [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] in 1880, and the following year its [[Liverpool University|university]] was established.

In 1903 an [[International Exhibition]] took place in [[Edge Lane]]. In 1904, the building of the [[Liverpool Cathedral|Anglican Cathedral]] began, and by 1916 the three [[Pier Head]] buildings, including the [[Liver Building]], were complete. This period marked the pinnacle of Liverpool's economic success, when it regarded itself as the \"second city\" of the [[British Empire]].<ref name=Belchem /> The formerly independent [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]]s of [[Allerton, Merseyside|Allerton]], [[Childwall]], [[Woolton|Little Woolton and Much Woolton]] were added in 1913, and the parish of [[Speke]] added in 1932, with large housing developments, mostly by the local authority, being built over the next few years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10027317 |title=Liverpool CB/MB |work=A vision of Britain through time |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831062153/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit_page.jsp%3Bjsessionid%3D06E75550A4804D79E1E30D8BAF9130D5?u_id=10027317#tab02 |archivedate=31 August 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[Adolf Hitler]]'s half-brother Alois and his Irish sister-in-law [[Bridget Dowling]] are known to have lived in Upper Stanhope Street in the 1910s.

However, it was changed to depart from [[Southampton]] instead.\n\nAside from the large [[Irish people|Irish]] community in Liverpool, there were other pockets of cultural diversity. The area of Gerard, Hunter, Lionel and Whale streets, off [[Scotland Road]], was referred to as ''Little Italy''. Inspired by an old [[Venice|Venetian]] custom, Liverpool was 'married to the sea' in September 1928. Liverpool was also home to a large Welsh population, and was sometimes referred to as the Capital of North Wales. In 1884, 1900 and 1929, [[Eisteddfod]]s were held in Liverpool. The population of the city peaked at over 850,000 in the 1930s.\n\nEconomic changes began in the first part of the 20th century, as falls in world demand for the North West's traditional export commodities contributed to stagnation and decline in the city. Unemployment was well above the national average as early as the 1920s, and the city became known nationally for its occasionally violent religious [[sectarianism]].<ref name=Belchem />\n\nWhen [[Everton F.C.]] won the [[Football League First Division]] title in 1928, their centre-forward [[Dixie Dean]] scored a [[Football League]] record of 60 goals in the same season.\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] hit Liverpool badly in the early 1930s with thousands of people in the city left unemployed. This was combated by a large amount of housing mostly built by the local council being constructed, creating jobs mostly in the building, plumbing and electrical trades. About 15 per cent of the city's population were rehoused in the 1920s and 1930s with more than 30,000 new council houses being built to replace the slums in the city.\n\nThe rising popularity of motor cars led to congestion in the city, and in 1934 the city gained its first direct road link with the [[Wirral Peninsula]], when the first [[Mersey Tunnel]] road was opened. The Queensway, as the new tunnel was named, linked Liverpool with [[Birkenhead]] at the other side of the Mersey. Many other buildings were built in the city in the 1930s to ease the depression and became local landmarks, with many buildings featuring American inspired architecture.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/content/articles/2009/03/02/history_creativity_in_depression_feature.shtml|title=Creativity in the Great Depression|first=Paul|last=Coslett|work=BBC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627093143/http://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/content/articles/2009/03/02/history_creativity_in_depression_feature.shtml|archivedate=27 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n===1939-1945: World War II===\n{{main|Liverpool Blitz}}\nDuring World War 2, Liverpool was the control centre for the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. There were eighty [[Liverpool Blitz|air-raids on Merseyside]], with an especially concentrated series of raids in May 1941 which interrupted operations at the docks for almost a week. Some 2,500 people were killed,<ref>Some sources state 4,000</ref> almost half the homes in the metropolitan area sustained some damage and some 11,000 were totally destroyed. Over 70,000 people were made homeless.<ref name=Belchem /> [[John Lennon]], one of the founding members of [[The Beatles]], was born in Liverpool during an air-raid on 9 October 1940. All four members of The Beatles were born in the city during the war, rising to fame in the early 1960s.\n\n===1946-1979===\n[[File:Capel Celyn exposed tree stumps.jpg|right|thumb|Tree stumps exposed by low water level of reservoir, at [[Capel Celyn]], a Welsh village flooded to provide water for Liverpool.]]\n\nSignificant rebuilding followed the war, including massive housing estates and the [[Seaforth Dock]], the largest dock project in Britain. However, the city has been suffering since the 1950s with the loss of numerous employers. By 1985 the population had fallen to 460,000. Declines in manufacturing and dock activity struck the city particularly hard. In 1956 [[Liverpool Overhead Railway]] and its fourteen stations were closed and demolished and in 1957 [[Liverpool Corporation Tramways]] closed after the last tram ran in Liverpool.\n\nIn 1955, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], led locally by Jack and [[Bessie Braddock]], came to power in the City Council for the first time.\n\nIn 1956, a [[private bill]] sponsored by [[Liverpool City Council]] was brought before [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] to develop a water reservoir from the [[Afon Tryweryn|Tryweryn Valley]]. The development would include the flooding of [[Capel Celyn]]. By obtaining authority via an Act of Parliament, Liverpool City Council would not require planning consent from the relevant Welsh Local Authorities. This, together with the fact that the village was one of the last Welsh-only speaking communities, ensured that the proposals became deeply controversial. Thirty five out of thirty six Welsh [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) opposed the bill (the other did not vote), but in 1957 it was passed. The members of the community waged an eight-year effort, ultimately unsuccessful, to prevent the destruction of their homes, which finally occurred in 1965. The incident led to a massive rise in [[Welsh nationalism]], and a year later, [[Gwynfor Evans]] of [[Plaid Cymru]] won the party's first seat in the [[1966 Carmarthen by-election|Carmathen by-election]].\n\nIn the 1960s Liverpool became a centre of [[youth culture]]. The city produced the distinctive [[Beat music|Merseybeat]] sound, most famously [[The Beatles]], and the [[Liverpool poets]].\n\nFrom the 1970s onwards Liverpool's docks and traditional manufacturing industries went into further sharp decline. The advent of [[containerisation]] meant that Liverpool's docks ceased to be a major local employer. [[Liverpool Central High Level railway station]] closed in 1972, as well as the [[Waterloo Tunnel|Waterloo]], [[Victoria Tunnel (Liverpool)|Victoria]] and [[Wapping Tunnel|Wapping]] tunnels. In 1974, Liverpool became a [[metropolitan district]] within the newly created [[metropolitan county]] of [[Merseyside]]. In 1977 [[Liverpool Exchange railway station]] closed, and in 1979 the [[North Liverpool Extension Line]] closed too. In 1972 [[Canadian Pacific Limited|Canadian Pacific]] unit [[CP Ships]] were the last transatlantic line to operate from Liverpool.\n\n===1980s===\nThe 1980s saw Liverpool's fortunes sink to their lowest postwar point. Although the 1970s, along with the rest of Britain, had brought economic difficulties and a steady rise in unemployment, the situation in Liverpool went from bad to worse in the early 1980s, with endless factory closures and some of the highest unemployment rates in the UK. An average of 12,000 people each year were leaving the city, and 15% of its land was vacant or derelict.<ref name=Belchem />\n\nIn July 1981 the infamous [[1981 Toxteth riots|Toxteth Riots]] took place, during which, for the first time in the UK outside [[Northern Ireland]], [[tear gas]] was used by police against civilians. In the same year, the [[Tate and Lyle]] sugar works, previously a mainstay of the city's manufacturing economy, closed down. The docks had already declined dramatically by this stage, depriving the city of another major source of employment.\n\nBy 1985, unemployment in Liverpool exceeded 20%, around double the national average. About this time the scourge of heroin, always present in port cities, began to rise.\n\n[[Liverpool City Council]] was dominated by the far-left wing [[Militant tendency|Militant]] group during the 1980s, under the ''de facto'' leadership of [[Derek Hatton]] (although Hatton was formally only Deputy Leader). The city council sank heavily into debt, as the City Council fought a campaign to prevent central government from reducing funding for local services. Ultimately this led to 49 of the City's Councillors being removed from office by the District Auditor for refusing to cut the budget, refusing to make good the deficit and forcing the City Council into virtual bankruptcy. The conduct of Hatton and the militant tendency had even come under the scrutiny of Labour Party leader [[Neil Kinnock]], who was keen to remove the militant tendency from the party as part of the attempt to make it electable again. At the same time, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] was deeply unpopular in Liverpool, with the Conservatives share of the vote in most local council and parliamentary elections being consistently low throughout the 1980s.\n\nOn 15 April 1989, 96 [[Liverpool F.C.]] fans (mostly from [[Merseyside]] as well as neighbouring parts of [[Cheshire]] and [[Lancashire]]) were fatally injured in the [[Hillsborough disaster]] at an [[FA Cup]] semi-final in [[Sheffield]]. This had a traumatic effect on people across the country, particularly in and around the city of Liverpool, and resulted in legally imposed changes in the way in which football fans have since been accommodated, including compulsory all-seater stadiums at all leading English clubs by the mid 1990s. Many clubs removed their perimeter fencing almost immediately after the tragedy, and such measures at football grounds in England have long since been banned.\n\nIn particular this led to strong feeling in Liverpool because it was widely reported in the media that the Liverpool fans were at fault. ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' sparked particular controversy for publishing these allegations in an article four days after the disaster. Sales of the newspaper in Liverpool slumped and many newsagents refused to stock it. Three decades later, many people in the city still refuse to buy ''The Sun'' and a number of newsagents still refuse to sell it. Other media outlets including the ''[[Daily Star (British newspaper)|Daily Star]]'' and ''[[Daily Mail]]'' also printed similar stories in which the behaviour of Liverpool fans was alleged to have been a major factor in the tragedy.\n\nThere was further controversy surrounding the tragedy in March 1991 when a verdict of accidental death was recorded on the 95 people who had died at Hillsborough (the 96th victim did not die until 1993), much to the dismay of the bereaved families, who had been hoping for a verdict of unlawful killing, or an open verdict, to be recorded; and for criminal charges to be brought against South Yorkshire Police. This verdict was eventually replaced by one of unlawful killing at fresh inquest 25 years later.\n\nIt has since become clear that [[South Yorkshire Police]] made a range of mistakes at the game, though the senior officer in charge of the event retired soon after.\n\nThe success of Liverpool FC was some compensation for the city's economic misfortune during the 1970s and 1980s. The club, formed in 1892, had won five league titles by 1947, but enjoyed its first consistent run of success under the management of [[Bill Shankly]] between 1959 and 1974, winning a further three league titles as well as the club's first two [[FA Cup]]s and its first European trophy in the shape of the [[UEFA Cup]]. Following Shankly's retirement, the club continued to dominate English football for nearly 20 years afterwards. By 1990, Liverpool FC had won more major trophies than any other English club - a total of 18 top division league titles, four FA Cups, four [[Football League Cup]]s, four [[European Cup]]s and two UEFA Cups.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisanfield.com/clubinfo/honours/|title=Liverpool FC Honours List|work=This is Anfield|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref> The club's iconic red shirt had been worn by some of the biggest names in British sport of the 1970s and 1980s, including [[Kevin Keegan]], [[Kenny Dalglish]] (who also served as manager from 1985 to 1991 and again from 2011 to 2012), [[Phil Neal]], [[Ian Rush]], [[Ian Callaghan]] and [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]]. The club has yet to win another league title since, although it has since won a further three FA Cups, three League Cups, a UEFA Cup and two European Cups, and fielded a new wave of stars including [[Robbie Fowler]], [[Michael Owen]], [[Jamie Carragher]] and [[Steven Gerrard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pinterest.com/officiallfc/liverpool-legends/|title=Liverpool Legends|work=Pinterest|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Everton F.C.]], the city's other senior football club, also enjoyed a degree of success during the 1970s and 1980s. The club had enjoyed a consistent run of success during the interwar years and again in the 1960s, but after winning the league title in 1970 went 14 years without winning a major trophy, although they did hold onto the First Division place which had been theirs since 1954. Then, in 1984, Everton won the [[FA Cup]] under the management of [[Howard Kendall]], who had once been a player at the club.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/history/kendall-s-heroes.html|title=1981 - 2002|work=Everton F.C.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130142508/http://www.evertonfc.com/history/kendall-s-heroes.html|archivedate=30 January 2013}}</ref> A league title win followed in 1985, along with the club's first European trophy - the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/history/kendall-s-heroes.html?tab=1|title=1981 - 2002|work=Everton F.C.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124160812/http://www.evertonfc.com/history/kendall-s-heroes.html?tab=1|archivedate=24 January 2012}}</ref> By 1986, the city's two clubs were firmly established as the leading club sides in England as Liverpool finished league champions and Everton runners-up, and the two sides also met for the FA Cup final, which Liverpool won 3\u20131.

The two boys were found guilty of murder later in the year and sentenced to indefinite detention.\n\nThe 1990s saw the continued regeneration of the city which had started in the 1980s. This still happens in 2020\n\n==Recent history==\nA general economic and civic revival has been underway since the mid-nineties. Liverpool's economy has grown faster than the national average and its crime levels have remained lower than most other metropolitan areas in England and Wales, with recorded crime per head in Merseyside comparable to the national average \u2014 unusually low for an urban area.\n\nIn recent years, the city has emphasised its cultural attractions. Tourism has become a significant factor in Liverpool's economy, capitalising on the popularity of The Beatles and other groups of the Merseybeat era. In June 2003, Liverpool won the right to be named [[European Capital of Culture]] for 2008, beating other British cities such as [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and [[Birmingham]] to the coveted title. The riverfront of the city was also designated as a [[World Heritage Site]] in 2004.\n\nIn October 2005, Liverpool City Council passed a public apology for the flooding [[Capel Celyn]] in Wales.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/content/articles/2005/10/17/feature_welsh_reservoir_feature.shtml|title=Where I Live:Liverpool - Flooding Apology|first=Paul|last=Coslett|work=BBC Online|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref>   The full statement reads -\n{{cquote|''The Council acknowledges its debt to the many thousands of Welsh people who have made their homes in the City.

The borough was founded by [[royal charter]] in 1207 by King John, was made up of only seven streets in the shape of the letter 'H' but Liverpool remained a small settlement until its trade with [[Ireland]] and coastal parts of England and Wales was overtaken by trade with [[Africa]] and the [[West Indies]], which included the [[slave trade]].  The world's first [[wet dock]] was opened in 1715 and Liverpool's expansion to become a major city continued over the next two centuries.\n\nBy the start of the nineteenth century, a large volume of trade was passing through [[Liverpool]]. In 1830, the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] was opened. The population grew rapidly, especially with [[Irish diaspora|Irish]] migrants; by 1851, one quarter of the city's population was Irish-born.  As growth continued, the city became known as \"the second city of the [[British Empire|Empire]]\", and was also called \"the [[New York City|New York]] of Europe\".  During the Second World War, the city was the centre for planning the crucial [[Battle of the Atlantic]], and suffered a [[Liverpool Blitz|blitz]] second only to London's.\n\nFrom the mid-twentieth century, Liverpool's docks and traditional [[manufacturing industries]] went into sharp decline, with the advent of [[containerisation]] making the city's docks obsolete.  The [[unemployment rate]] in Liverpool rose to one of the highest in the UK. Over the same period, starting in the early 1960s, the city became internationally renowned for its culture, particularly as the centre of the \"[[Merseybeat]]\" sound which became synonymous with [[The Beatles]]. In recent years, Liverpool's economy has recovered, partly due to tourism as well as substantial investment in [[Urban regeneration|regeneration]] schemes.  The city was the [[European Capital of Culture]] for 2008.\n\n==Origins of the name==\nThe name comes from the Old English ''liver'', meaning thick or muddy, and ''pol'', meaning a pool or creek, and is first recorded around 1190 as ''Liuerpul''.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Hanks, Patrick|author2=Hodges, Flavia|author3=Mills, David|author4=Room, Adrian|title=The Oxford Names Companion|date=2002|location=Oxford|publisher=the University Press|isbn=0198605617|page=1110}}</ref><ref name=DH>{{cite web|title=Liverpool|publisher=The Online Etymology Dictionary|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=Liverpool|last=Harper|first=Douglas}}</ref> According to the ''Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names'', \"The original reference was to a pool or tidal creek now filled up into which two streams drained\".<ref name=DH/> The adjective ''Liverpudlian'' is first recorded in 1833.<ref name=DH/>\n\n==Early history of the area==\n[[File:The Calder Stones, Calderstones Park - geograph.org.uk - 40880.jpg|thumbnail|right|The ancient neolithic Calder Stones on display in the Harthill Greenhouses]]\nIn the [[Iron Age]] the area around modern-day Liverpool was sparsely populated, though there was a seaport at [[Meols]]. The [[Calderstones Park|Calderstones]] are thought to be part of an ancient [[stone circle]] and there is archaeological evidence for native Iron Age farmsteads at several sites in [[Irby, Merseyside|Irby]], [[Halewood]] and [[Lathom]]. The region was inhabited by [[Britons (Celtic people)|Brythonic]] tribes, the [[Setantii]] as well as nearby [[Cornovii (Midlands)|Cornovii]] and [[Deceangli]]. It came under Roman influence in about 70 AD, with the northward advance to crush the [[druid]] resistance at [[Anglesey]] and to end the internal strife between the ruling family of [[Brigantes]]. The main Roman presence was at the fortress and settlement at [[Chester]].

The settlements at [[Walton, Liverpool|Walton]] (''Wealas tun'' meaning 'farmstead of the [[Walhaz|Wealas]]'), and [[Wallasey]] (''Wealas-eg'' meaning 'island of the Wealas') were named at this time with ''Wealas'' being [[Old English]] for 'foreigner' referring to the native [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Romano-British culture|Romanized inhabitants]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Eilert|last=Ekwall|authorlink=Eilert Ekwall|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names|publisher=OUP|year=1936}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Wales|title=Wales|work=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe pseudo-historical ''[[Fragmentary Annals of Ireland]]'' appears to record the Norse settlement of the [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]] in its account of the immigration of [[Ingimundr (tenth century)|Ingimundr]] near Chester.

(circa 1200)]]\nAlthough a small [[motte and bailey]] castle had earlier been built by the Normans at [[West Derby]], the origins of the city of Liverpool are usually dated from 28 August 1207, when [[letters patent]] were issued by [[John of England|King John]] advertising the establishment of a new borough, \"Livpul\", and inviting settlers to come and take up holdings there. It is thought that the King wanted a port in the district that was free from the control of the [[Earl of Chester]]. Initially it served as a dispatch point for troops sent to Ireland, soon after the building around 1235 of [[Liverpool Castle]], which was removed in 1726. [[Church of Our Lady and Saint Nicholas, Liverpool|St Nicholas Church]] was built by 1257, originally as a chapel within the parish of [[Walton, Merseyside|Walton-on-the-Hill]].<ref name=Belchem>{{cite book|editor-first=John|editor-last=Belchem|title=Liverpool 800: Culture, Character & History|year=2006|isbn=1-84631-035-0}}</ref> In the 13th Century, Liverpool as an area comprised just seven streets.\n\nWith the formation of a market on the site of the later Town Hall, Liverpool became established as a small fishing and farming community, administered by [[burgess (title)|burgesses]] and, slightly later, a mayor. There was probably some coastal trade around the [[Irish Sea]], and there were occasional ferries across the Mersey. However, for several centuries it remained a small and relatively unimportant settlement, with a population of no more than 1,000 in the mid 14th century. By the early fifteenth century a period of economic decline set in, and the county gentry increased their power over the town, the [[John I Stanley of the Isle of Man|Stanley]] family fortifying their house by building Stanley Tower on Water Street. This was a catalyst for a feud between the Stanley and [[Earl of Sefton|Molyneux]] families since the Molyneux family had permission to live at the nearby [[Liverpool Castle]] at that time. The resulting rivalry nearly spilled into a riot in 1424.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historyofliverpool.com/liverpool-molyneux-stanley-family-history/|title=Text only version of our interactive Liverpool Molyneux Stanley family history page.|work=The History of Liverpool|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref> In the middle of the 16th century the population of Liverpool had fallen to around 600, and the port was regarded as subordinate to [[Chester, England|Chester]] until the 1650s.\n\n==Elizabethan era and the Civil War==\n[[File:Liverpool.1572.jpg|thumb|Liverpool in 1572.]]\nIn 1571 the people of Liverpool sent a memorial to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]], praying relief from a subsidy which they thought themselves unable to bear, wherein they styled themselves \"''her majesty's poor decayed town of Liverpool.''\" Some time towards the close of this reign, [[Henry Stanley, 4th Earl of Derby]], on his way to the [[Isle of Man]], stayed at his house, the Tower; at which the corporation erected a handsome hall or seat for him in the church, where he honoured them several times with his presence.\n\nBy the end of the sixteenth century, the town began to be able to take advantage of economic revival and the silting of the [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]] to win trade, mainly from Chester, to Ireland, the Isle of Man and elsewhere. In 1626, King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] gave the town a new and improved charter.<ref name=Belchem />\n[[File:Liverpool.1650.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Liverpool in 1650.]]\n\nIn June 1644 [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]] arrived in Liverpool with 10,000 men in an attempt to capture [[Liverpool Castle]]. A sixteen-day siege of Liverpool then took place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historyofliverpool.com/civil-war-siege-liverpool/|title=Civil War Siege of Liverpool|work=The History of Liverpool|accessdate=25 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180403112400/http://historyofliverpool.com/civil-war-siege-liverpool/|archive-date=3 April 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> To defend the city the [[New Model Army|Parliament Army]] created a huge trench across much of the town centre. Prince Rupert eventually took hold of the Castle only to be driven out again to take refuge in the Everton area of the city, hence the name of the tower found on the modern day Everton Football Club badge is known as [[Everton Lock-Up|Prince Rupert's Tower]].\n\n==Transatlantic trade==\nThe first cargo from the Americas was recorded in 1648. The development of the town accelerated after the Restoration of 1660, with the growth of trade with America and the [[West Indies]]. From that time may be traced the rapid progress of population and commerce, until Liverpool had become the second metropolis of Great Britain. Initially, cloth, coal and salt from Lancashire and Cheshire were exchanged for sugar and tobacco; the town's first sugar refinery was established in 1667.<ref>http://www.mawer.clara.net/loc-liverpool.html</ref>\n\nIn 1699 Liverpool was made a [[parish]] on its own by [[Act of Parliament]], separate from that of Walton-on-the-Hill, with two parish churches. At the same time it gained separate customs authority from Chester.<ref name=\"Belchem\" />\n\n==Slavery==\nOn 3 October 1699, the very same year that Liverpool had been granted status as an independent parish, Liverpool's first 'recorded' [[slave ship]], named ''Liverpool Merchant'', set sail for Africa, arriving in Barbados with a 'cargo' of 220 Africans, returning to Liverpool on 18 September 1700. The following month a second recorded ship, ''The Blessing'', set sail for the Gold Coast.\n\nThe first commercial [[wet dock]] in Britain was built in Liverpool and completed in 1715. It was the first in the world and was constructed for a capacity of 100 ships. By the close of the 18th century 40% of the world's, and 80% of Britain's Atlantic slave activity was accounted for by slave ships that voyaged from the [[:Category:Liverpool docks|docks at Liverpool]]. This growth led to the opening of the [[Consulate of the United States in Liverpool]] in 1790, its first consulate anywhere in the world.\n\nVast profits from the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]] transformed Liverpool into one of Britain's foremost important cities. Liverpool became a financial centre, rivalled by Bristol, another slaving port, and beaten only by London. In the peak year of 1799, ships sailing from Liverpool carried over 45,000 slaves from Africa.<ref name=Belchem />\n\nMany factors led to the demise of slavery including revolts, piracy, social unrest, and the repercussions of corruption such as slave insurance fraud, e.g. the [[Zong Massacre|''Zong'' massacre]] case in 1783. It was Liverpool born politician [[William Roscoe]] who spearheaded the anti-Slavery movement in parliament at the time.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Liverpool Slave Trade |publisher=History of Liverpool |url=http://historyofliverpool.com/liverpool-slave-trade/ |accessdate=28  February 2015}}</ref>\n\nSlavery in British colonies was finally abolished in 1833 and slave trading was made illegal in 1807 though some slavery apprenticeships ran until 1838.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/localhistory/journey/american_connection/slavery/timeline.shtml|work=BBC|title=Liverpool Local History - American Connections - Slavery Timeline|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref> However, many merchants managed to ignore the laws and continued to deal in underground slave trafficking, also underhandedly engaging in financial investments for slaving activities in the Americas.\n\n==Industrial revolution and commercial expansion==\n{{Gallery\n| title        = 19th Century Liverpool\n| align        =\n| footer       =\n| style        =\n| state        =\n| height       =\n| width        =\n| captionstyle =\n| File:Cunard Line New York Liverpool 1875.jpg\n | alt1= [[Cunard Line]] est. 1840, poster 1875\n | [[Cunard Line]] est. 1840, poster 1875\n|File:George's Dock 1897.jpg\n|alt2=[[George's Dock]] opened 1771, closed 1899, photo 1897\n|[[George's Dock]] opened 1771, closed 1899, photo 1897\n|File:Seaforth Sands railway station 1.jpg\n|alt3=[[Liverpool Overhead Railway]]\n|[[Liverpool Overhead Railway]] [[Seaforth Sands railway station]] opened 1894, railway opened 1893, photo 1951\n|File:White Star Offices, Liverpool.jpg\n|alt4=[[White Star Line]] offices, 1890s\n|[[White Star Line]] offices, 1890s\n|File:Roscoe GJR(1839) p155 - Entrance to the Railway Station at Liverpool.jpg\n|alt5=[[Liverpool Lime Street Station]] opening 1839\n|[[Liverpool Lime Street Station]] opening 1839\n|File:Liverpool1890s.jpg\n|alt6=Colourised photo taken in the 1890s.

Liverpool was first linked by canal to Manchester in 1721, the [[St Helens, Merseyside|St. Helens]] coalfield in 1755, and Leeds in 1816. In 1830, Liverpool became home to the world's first inter-urban rail link to another city, [[Manchester]], through the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] and the maiden journey Stephenson's [[Stephenson's Rocket|The Rocket]] train.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://historyofliverpool.com/ks3-history-railways/ |title = KS3 History Railways|work=The History of Liverpool|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nLiverpool's importance was such that it was home to a number of world firsts, including gaining the world's first fully electrically powered overhead railway, the [[Liverpool Overhead Railway]], which was opened in 1893 and so pre-dated those in both [[New York City]] and [[Chicago]].\n\nThe built-up area grew rapidly from the eighteenth century on. The [[Liverpool Blue Coat School|Bluecoat Hospital]] for poor children opened in 1718. With the demolition of the castle in 1726, only [[Church of Our Lady and Saint Nicholas, Liverpool|St Nicholas Church]] and the historic street plan - with Castle Street as the spine of the original settlement, and [[Paradise Street, Liverpool|Paradise Street]] following the line of the Pool - remained to reflect the town's mediaeval origins. The Town Hall, with a covered exchange for merchants designed by architect [[John Wood, the Elder|John Wood]], was built in 1754, and the first office buildings including the Corn Exchange were opened in about 1810.\n\nThroughout the 19th century Liverpool's trade and its population continued to expanded rapidly. Growth in the cotton trade was accompanied by the development of strong trading links with India and the Far East following the ending of the [[Honourable East India Company|East India Company's]] monopoly in 1813. Over {{convert|140|acre|km2}} of new docks, with {{convert|10|mi|km}} of quay space, were opened between 1824 and 1858.<ref name=Belchem />\n\n[[File:Situationsplan von Liverpool.jpg|thumb|Map of Liverpool from 1880]]\nDuring the 1840s, [[Irish diaspora|Irish]] migrants began arriving by the thousands due to the [[Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849)|Great Famine]] of 1845-1849. Almost 300,000 arrived in the year 1847 alone, and by 1851 approximately 25% of the city was Irish-born. The Irish influence is reflected in the unique place Liverpool occupies in UK and Irish political history, being the only place outside Ireland to elect a member of parliament from the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] to the British parliament in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]]. [[T.P. O'Connor]] represented the constituency of [[Liverpool Scotland (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Scotland]] from 1885 to 1929.\n\nAs the town became a leading port of the [[British Empire]], a number of major buildings were constructed, including [[St. George\u2019s Hall, Liverpool|St. George's Hall]] (1854), and [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Lime Street Station]]. The [[Grand National]] steeplechase was first run at Aintree in 1837.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historyofliverpool.com/ks3-history-victorian-times/|title=KS3 History Victorian Times|work=History of Liverpool|accessdate=25 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126062459/http://historyofliverpool.com/ks3-history-victorian-times/|archive-date=26 November 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1851 and 1911, Liverpool attracted at least 20,000 people from Wales in each decade, peaking in the 1880s, and Welsh culture flourished.

The prevalence of cotton and slave interests in Liverpool ensured that the city was, in the words of the historian [[Sven Beckert]], \"the most pro-Confederate place in the world outside the Confederacy itself.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = Empire of Cotton: a Global History|last = Beckert|first = Sven|publisher = Knopf|year = 2014|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}</ref> The [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] Navy ship, the [[CSS Alabama|CSS ''Alabama'']], was built at [[Birkenhead]] on the Mersey and the [[CSS Shenandoah|CSS ''Shenandoah'']] surrendered there (being the final surrender and end of the war).\n\nLiverpool was granted [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] in 1880, and the following year its [[Liverpool University|university]] was established.

However, it was changed to depart from [[Southampton]] instead.\n\nAside from the large [[Irish people|Irish]] community in Liverpool, there were other pockets of cultural diversity. The area of Gerard, Hunter, Lionel and Whale streets, off [[Scotland Road]], was referred to as ''Little Italy''. Inspired by an old [[Venice|Venetian]] custom, Liverpool was 'married to the sea' in September 1928. Liverpool was also home to a large Welsh population, and was sometimes referred to as the Capital of North Wales. In 1884, 1900 and 1929, [[Eisteddfod]]s were held in Liverpool. The population of the city peaked at over 850,000 in the 1930s.\n\nEconomic changes began in the first part of the 20th century, as falls in world demand for the North West's traditional export commodities contributed to stagnation and decline in the city. Unemployment was well above the national average as early as the 1920s, and the city became known nationally for its occasionally violent religious [[sectarianism]].<ref name=Belchem />\n\nWhen [[Everton F.C.]] won the [[Football League First Division]] title in 1928, their centre-forward [[Dixie Dean]] scored a [[Football League]] record of 60 goals in the same season.\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] hit Liverpool badly in the early 1930s with thousands of people in the city left unemployed. This was combated by a large amount of housing mostly built by the local council being constructed, creating jobs mostly in the building, plumbing and electrical trades. About 15 per cent of the city's population were rehoused in the 1920s and 1930s with more than 30,000 new council houses being built to replace the slums in the city.\n\nThe rising popularity of motor cars led to congestion in the city, and in 1934 the city gained its first direct road link with the [[Wirral Peninsula]], when the first [[Mersey Tunnel]] road was opened. The Queensway, as the new tunnel was named, linked Liverpool with [[Birkenhead]] at the other side of the Mersey. Many other buildings were built in the city in the 1930s to ease the depression and became local landmarks, with many buildings featuring American inspired architecture.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/content/articles/2009/03/02/history_creativity_in_depression_feature.shtml|title=Creativity in the Great Depression|first=Paul|last=Coslett|work=BBC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627093143/http://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/content/articles/2009/03/02/history_creativity_in_depression_feature.shtml|archivedate=27 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n===1939-1945: World War II===\n{{main|Liverpool Blitz}}\nDuring World War 2, Liverpool was the control centre for the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].

However, the city has been suffering since the 1950s with the loss of numerous employers. By 1985 the population had fallen to 460,000. Declines in manufacturing and dock activity struck the city particularly hard. In 1956 [[Liverpool Overhead Railway]] and its fourteen stations were closed and demolished and in 1957 [[Liverpool Corporation Tramways]] closed after the last tram ran in Liverpool.\n\nIn 1955, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], led locally by Jack and [[Bessie Braddock]], came to power in the City Council for the first time.\n\nIn 1956, a [[private bill]] sponsored by [[Liverpool City Council]] was brought before [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] to develop a water reservoir from the [[Afon Tryweryn|Tryweryn Valley]]. The development would include the flooding of [[Capel Celyn]]. By obtaining authority via an Act of Parliament, Liverpool City Council would not require planning consent from the relevant Welsh Local Authorities. This, together with the fact that the village was one of the last Welsh-only speaking communities, ensured that the proposals became deeply controversial. Thirty five out of thirty six Welsh [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) opposed the bill (the other did not vote), but in 1957 it was passed. The members of the community waged an eight-year effort, ultimately unsuccessful, to prevent the destruction of their homes, which finally occurred in 1965. The incident led to a massive rise in [[Welsh nationalism]], and a year later, [[Gwynfor Evans]] of [[Plaid Cymru]] won the party's first seat in the [[1966 Carmarthen by-election|Carmathen by-election]].\n\nIn the 1960s Liverpool became a centre of [[youth culture]]. The city produced the distinctive [[Beat music|Merseybeat]] sound, most famously [[The Beatles]], and the [[Liverpool poets]].\n\nFrom the 1970s onwards Liverpool's docks and traditional manufacturing industries went into further sharp decline. The advent of [[containerisation]] meant that Liverpool's docks ceased to be a major local employer. [[Liverpool Central High Level railway station]] closed in 1972, as well as the [[Waterloo Tunnel|Waterloo]], [[Victoria Tunnel (Liverpool)|Victoria]] and [[Wapping Tunnel|Wapping]] tunnels. In 1974, Liverpool became a [[metropolitan district]] within the newly created [[metropolitan county]] of [[Merseyside]]. In 1977 [[Liverpool Exchange railway station]] closed, and in 1979 the [[North Liverpool Extension Line]] closed too. In 1972 [[Canadian Pacific Limited|Canadian Pacific]] unit [[CP Ships]] were the last transatlantic line to operate from Liverpool.\n\n===1980s===\nThe 1980s saw Liverpool's fortunes sink to their lowest postwar point. Although the 1970s, along with the rest of Britain, had brought economic difficulties and a steady rise in unemployment, the situation in Liverpool went from bad to worse in the early 1980s, with endless factory closures and some of the highest unemployment rates in the UK. An average of 12,000 people each year were leaving the city, and 15% of its land was vacant or derelict.<ref name=Belchem />\n\nIn July 1981 the infamous [[1981 Toxteth riots|Toxteth Riots]] took place, during which, for the first time in the UK outside [[Northern Ireland]], [[tear gas]] was used by police against civilians. In the same year, the [[Tate and Lyle]] sugar works, previously a mainstay of the city's manufacturing economy, closed down. The docks had already declined dramatically by this stage, depriving the city of another major source of employment.\n\nBy 1985, unemployment in Liverpool exceeded 20%, around double the national average. About this time the scourge of heroin, always present in port cities, began to rise.\n\n[[Liverpool City Council]] was dominated by the far-left wing [[Militant tendency|Militant]] group during the 1980s, under the ''de facto'' leadership of [[Derek Hatton]] (although Hatton was formally only Deputy Leader). The city council sank heavily into debt, as the City Council fought a campaign to prevent central government from reducing funding for local services. Ultimately this led to 49 of the City's Councillors being removed from office by the District Auditor for refusing to cut the budget, refusing to make good the deficit and forcing the City Council into virtual bankruptcy. The conduct of Hatton and the militant tendency had even come under the scrutiny of Labour Party leader [[Neil Kinnock]], who was keen to remove the militant tendency from the party as part of the attempt to make it electable again. At the same time, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] was deeply unpopular in Liverpool, with the Conservatives share of the vote in most local council and parliamentary elections being consistently low throughout the 1980s.\n\nOn 15 April 1989, 96 [[Liverpool F.C.]] fans (mostly from [[Merseyside]] as well as neighbouring parts of [[Cheshire]] and [[Lancashire]]) were fatally injured in the [[Hillsborough disaster]] at an [[FA Cup]] semi-final in [[Sheffield]]. This had a traumatic effect on people across the country, particularly in and around the city of Liverpool, and resulted in legally imposed changes in the way in which football fans have since been accommodated, including compulsory all-seater stadiums at all leading English clubs by the mid 1990s. Many clubs removed their perimeter fencing almost immediately after the tragedy, and such measures at football grounds in England have long since been banned.\n\nIn particular this led to strong feeling in Liverpool because it was widely reported in the media that the Liverpool fans were at fault. ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' sparked particular controversy for publishing these allegations in an article four days after the disaster. Sales of the newspaper in Liverpool slumped and many newsagents refused to stock it. Three decades later, many people in the city still refuse to buy ''The Sun'' and a number of newsagents still refuse to sell it. Other media outlets including the ''[[Daily Star (British newspaper)|Daily Star]]'' and ''[[Daily Mail]]'' also printed similar stories in which the behaviour of Liverpool fans was alleged to have been a major factor in the tragedy.\n\nThere was further controversy surrounding the tragedy in March 1991 when a verdict of accidental death was recorded on the 95 people who had died at Hillsborough (the 96th victim did not die until 1993), much to the dismay of the bereaved families, who had been hoping for a verdict of unlawful killing, or an open verdict, to be recorded; and for criminal charges to be brought against South Yorkshire Police. This verdict was eventually replaced by one of unlawful killing at fresh inquest 25 years later.\n\nIt has since become clear that [[South Yorkshire Police]] made a range of mistakes at the game, though the senior officer in charge of the event retired soon after.\n\nThe success of Liverpool FC was some compensation for the city's economic misfortune during the 1970s and 1980s. The club, formed in 1892, had won five league titles by 1947, but enjoyed its first consistent run of success under the management of [[Bill Shankly]] between 1959 and 1974, winning a further three league titles as well as the club's first two [[FA Cup]]s and its first European trophy in the shape of the [[UEFA Cup]]. Following Shankly's retirement, the club continued to dominate English football for nearly 20 years afterwards. By 1990, Liverpool FC had won more major trophies than any other English club - a total of 18 top division league titles, four FA Cups, four [[Football League Cup]]s, four [[European Cup]]s and two UEFA Cups.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisanfield.com/clubinfo/honours/|title=Liverpool FC Honours List|work=This is Anfield|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref> The club's iconic red shirt had been worn by some of the biggest names in British sport of the 1970s and 1980s, including [[Kevin Keegan]], [[Kenny Dalglish]] (who also served as manager from 1985 to 1991 and again from 2011 to 2012), [[Phil Neal]], [[Ian Rush]], [[Ian Callaghan]] and [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]]. The club has yet to win another league title since, although it has since won a further three FA Cups, three League Cups, a UEFA Cup and two European Cups, and fielded a new wave of stars including [[Robbie Fowler]], [[Michael Owen]], [[Jamie Carragher]] and [[Steven Gerrard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pinterest.com/officiallfc/liverpool-legends/|title=Liverpool Legends|work=Pinterest|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Everton F.C.]], the city's other senior football club, also enjoyed a degree of success during the 1970s and 1980s. The club had enjoyed a consistent run of success during the interwar years and again in the 1960s, but after winning the league title in 1970 went 14 years without winning a major trophy, although they did hold onto the First Division place which had been theirs since 1954. Then, in 1984, Everton won the [[FA Cup]] under the management of [[Howard Kendall]], who had once been a player at the club.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/history/kendall-s-heroes.html|title=1981 - 2002|work=Everton F.C.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130142508/http://www.evertonfc.com/history/kendall-s-heroes.html|archivedate=30 January 2013}}</ref> A league title win followed in 1985, along with the club's first European trophy - the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/history/kendall-s-heroes.html?tab=1|title=1981 - 2002|work=Everton F.C.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124160812/http://www.evertonfc.com/history/kendall-s-heroes.html?tab=1|archivedate=24 January 2012}}</ref> By 1986, the city's two clubs were firmly established as the leading club sides in England as Liverpool finished league champions and Everton runners-up, and the two sides also met for the FA Cup final, which Liverpool won 3-1.

The two boys were found guilty of murder later in the year and sentenced to indefinite detention.\n\nThe 1990s saw the continued regeneration of the city which had started in the 1980s. This still happens in 2020\n\n==Recent history==\nA general economic and civic revival has been underway since the mid-nineties. Liverpool's economy has grown faster than the national average and its crime levels have remained lower than most other metropolitan areas in England and Wales, with recorded crime per head in Merseyside comparable to the national average \u2014 unusually low for an urban area.\n\nIn recent years, the city has emphasised its cultural attractions. Tourism has become a significant factor in Liverpool's economy, capitalising on the popularity of The Beatles and other groups of the Merseybeat era. In June 2003, Liverpool won the right to be named [[European Capital of Culture]] for 2008, beating other British cities such as [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and [[Birmingham]] to the coveted title. The riverfront of the city was also designated as a [[World Heritage Site]] in 2004.\n\nIn October 2005, Liverpool City Council passed a public apology for the flooding [[Capel Celyn]] in Wales.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/content/articles/2005/10/17/feature_welsh_reservoir_feature.shtml|title=Where I Live:Liverpool - Flooding Apology|first=Paul|last=Coslett|work=BBC Online|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref>   The full statement reads -\n{{cquote|''The Council acknowledges its debt to the many thousands of Welsh people who have made their homes in the City.  They have, in so many ways, enriched the life of the City.  We know that Liverpool, especially in the fields of medicine and education, has been of real service to the people of Wales. We realise the hurt of forty years ago when the Tryweryn Valley was transformed into a reservoir to help meet the water needs of Liverpool.  For any insensitivity by our predecessor Council at that time, we apologise and hope that the historic and sound relationship between Liverpool and Wales can be completely restored.''}}\n\nIn October 2007, Liverpool and London continued with wildcat strikes after the end of the official [[2007 Royal Mail industrial disputes|CWU strikes]] that had been ongoing since June in a dispute with the [[Royal Mail]] over pay, pensions, and hours.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of Liverpool]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |year=2007 |last=Belchem |first=John |title=Irish, Catholic and Scouse: The History of the Liverpool-Irish, 1800-1939 |location=Liverpool |publisher=Liverpool University Press}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.historyofliverpool.com/ The History of Liverpool]\n*[http://www.Danielklongman.com/ Various tales from Liverpool's history]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060525053905/http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/srd/ Liverpool Slavery Remembrance Initiative]\n*[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=41369 British History Online]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080603060408/http://www.lmu.livjm.ac.uk/lhol/ Liverpool John Moores University]\n*[https://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/localhistory/ BBC Local History]\n*[http://www.localhistories.org/liverpool.html Local Histories]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071126094711/http://www.redstarline.org.uk/civil_war_in_liverpool.html Liverpool and the American Civil War]\n*[http://www.gresham.ac.uk/event.asp?PageId=45&EventId=478 \"Liverpool and the Slave Trade\"], lecture by Anthony Tibbles at [[Gresham College]], 19 March 2007  (available for download as video or audio files)\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090123085907/http://www.nowandthen.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/ Liverpool The Gateway To America]\n*[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/21324 Recollections of Old Liverpool, by A Nonagenarian], published 1836, from [[Project Gutenberg]]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090722103842/http://www.old-liverpool.co.uk/CityWalk.html Ward Lock Guide to Liverpool], excerpts, published 1949\n\n{{Liverpool related articles}}\n{{History of England|bar=yes}}\n\n[[Category:History of Liverpool|*]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: Liverpool based \u2192 Liverpool-based, 1845-1849 \u2192 1845\u20131849 (4)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Liverpool"}

His empirical findings challenge the assumption of human rationality prevailing in modern economic theory.\n\nWith [[Amos Tversky]] and others, Kahneman established a [[cognitive]] basis for common human errors that arise from [[heuristics in judgment and decision making|heuristics and biases]] (Kahneman & Tversky, 1973; Kahneman, [[Paul Slovic|Slovic]] & Tversky, 1982; Tversky & Kahneman, 1974), and developed [[prospect theory]] (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979).\n\nIn 2011, he was named by ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine in its list of top global thinkers.<ref name=\"ForeignPolicy November 2011\" /> In the same year, his book ''[[Thinking, Fast and Slow]]'', which summarizes much of his research, was published and became a best seller.<ref>{{cite web | title = The New York Times Best Seller List \u2013 December 25, 2011 | url = http://www.hawes.com/2011/2011-12-25.pdf | website = www.hawes.com | accessdate = 2014-08-17}}</ref>\n\nHe is professor emeritus of psychology and public affairs at [[Princeton University]]'s [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs|Woodrow Wilson School]].

He spent his childhood years in [[Paris]], [[France]], where his parents had emigrated from [[Lithuania]] in the early 1920s. Kahneman and his family were in Paris when it was [[Paris in World War II|occupied by Nazi Germany]] in 1940. His father, Efrayim, was picked up in the first major round-up of [[French Jews]], but he was released after six weeks due to the intervention of his employer, [[Eug\u00e8ne Schueller]].<ref name=\"MLTUP2016\">{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Michael |title=[[The Undoing Project|The Undoing Project: A Friendship That Changed Our Minds]] |location= New York |publisher=  Penguin Random House |orig-year=1st pub. in the USA by W.W.

Kahneman and his family then moved to [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandatory Palestine]] in 1948, just before the  creation of the state of Israel (Kahneman, 2003).\n\nKahneman has written of his experience in [[Vichy France|Nazi-occupied France]], explaining in part why he entered the field of psychology:\n\n<blockquote>It must have been late 1941 or early 1942. Jews were required to wear the Star of David and to obey a 6&nbsp;p.m. curfew. I had gone to play with a Christian friend and had stayed too late. I turned my brown sweater inside out to walk the few blocks home. As I was walking down an empty street, I saw a German soldier approaching. He was wearing the black uniform that I had been told to fear more than others \u2013 the one worn by specially recruited SS soldiers. As I came closer to him, trying to walk fast, I noticed that he was looking at me intently. Then he beckoned me over, picked me up, and hugged me. I was terrified that he would notice the star inside my sweater. He was speaking to me with great emotion, in German. When he put me down, he opened his wallet, showed me a picture of a boy, and gave me some money. I went home more certain than ever that my mother was right: people were endlessly complicated and interesting. (Kahneman, 2003, p. 417)</blockquote>\n\nKahneman received his bachelor of science degree with a major in [[psychology]], and a minor in [[mathematics]] from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] in 1954. After earning his undergraduate degree, he served in the psychology department of the [[Israeli Defense Forces]]. One of his responsibilities was to evaluate candidates for officer's training school, and to develop tests and measures for this purpose. In 1958, he went to the United States to study for his [[PhD]] in Psychology from the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. His 1961 dissertation, advised by [[Susan M. Ervin-Tripp|Susan Ervin]], examined relations between adjectives in the [[semantic differential]] and \"allowed me to engage in two of my favorite pursuits: the analysis of complex correlational structures and [[Fortran|FORTRAN]] programming,\" as he would later recall.<ref name=\"NobelPrize Bio 2002\"/>\n\n===Academic career===\n\n====Cognitive psychology====\nKahneman began his academic career as a lecturer in psychology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1961.<ref name=\"NobelPrize Bio 2002\"/> He was promoted to senior lecturer in 1966.\nHis early work focused on visual perception and attention. For example, his first publication in the prestigious journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' was entitled \"Pupil Diameter and Load on Memory\" (Kahneman & Beatty, 1966). During this period, Kahneman was a visiting scientist at the [[University of Michigan]] (1965\u201366) and the Applied Psychology Research Unit in [[Cambridge]] (1968/1969, summers). He was a fellow at the Center for Cognitive Studies, and a lecturer in [[cognitive psychology]] at [[Harvard University]] in 1966/1967.\n\n====Judgment and decision-making====\nThis period marks the beginning of Kahneman's lengthy collaboration with [[Amos Tversky]]. Together, Kahneman and Tversky published a series of seminal articles in the general field of judgment and [[decision-making]], culminating in the publication of their [[prospect theory]] in 1979 (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). Kahneman was ultimately awarded the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics]] in 2002 for his work on prospect theory. Following this, the pair teamed with [[Paul Slovic]] to edit a compilation entitled \"Judgement Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases\" (1982) that proved to be an important summary of their work and of other recent advances that had influenced their thinking.\n\nIn his Nobel biography, Kahneman states that his collaboration with Tversky began after Kahneman had invited Tversky to give a guest lecture to one of Kahneman's seminars at Hebrew University in 1968 or 1969.<ref name=\"NobelPrize Bio 2002\"/> Their first jointly written paper, \"Belief in the Law of Small Numbers,\" was published in 1971 (Tversky & Kahneman, 1971). They published seven articles in peer-reviewed journals in the years 1971\u20131979. Aside from \"Prospect Theory,\" the most important of these articles was \"Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases\" (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974), which was published in the prestigious journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' and introduced the notion of [[anchoring]].\n\nKahneman left Hebrew University in 1978 to take a position at the [[University of British Columbia]].<ref name=\"NobelPrize Bio 2002\"/>\n\n====Behavioral economics====\nKahneman and Tversky were both fellows at the [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]] at [[Stanford University]] in the academic year 1977\u20131978. A young economist named [[Richard Thaler]] was a visiting professor at the Stanford branch of the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] during that same year. According to Kahneman, \"[Thaler and I] soon became friends, and have ever since had a considerable influence on each other's thinking\" (Kahneman, 2003, p.&nbsp;437). Building on prospect theory and Kahneman and Tversky's body of work, Thaler published \"Toward a Positive Theory of Consumer Choice\" in 1980, a paper which Kahneman has called \"the founding text in [[behavioral economics]]\" (Kahneman, 2003, p.&nbsp;438).\n\nKahneman and Tversky became heavily involved in the development of this new approach to economic theory, and their involvement in this movement had the effect of reducing the intensity and exclusivity of their earlier period of joint collaboration. They would continue to publish together until the end of Tversky's life, but the period when Kahneman published almost exclusively with Tversky ended in 1983, when he published two papers with [[Anne Treisman]], his wife since 1978.\n\n====Hedonic psychology====\nIn the 1990s, Kahneman's research focus began to gradually shift in emphasis towards the field of \"[[hedonic psychology]]\". This subfield is closely related to the [[positive psychology]] movement, which was steadily gaining in popularity at the time. According to Kahneman and colleagues,\n<blockquote>Hedonic psychology...is the study of what makes experiences and life pleasant or unpleasant. It is concerned with feelings of pleasure and pain, of interest and boredom, of joy and sorrow, and of satisfaction and dissatisfaction. It is also concerned with the whole range of circumstances, from the biological to the societal, that occasion suffering and enjoyment.{{sfn|Kahneman|Diener|Schwarz|1999|p=ix}}</blockquote>\n\nIt is difficult to determine precisely when Kahneman's research began to focus on hedonics, although it likely stemmed from his work on the economic notion of [[utility]]. After publishing multiple articles and chapters in all but one of the years spanning the period 1979\u20131986 (for a total of 23 published works in 8 years), Kahneman published exactly one chapter during the years 1987\u20131989. After this hiatus, articles on utility and the psychology of utility began to appear (e.g., Kahneman & Snell, 1990; Kahneman & Thaler, 1991; Kahneman & Varey, 1991). In 1992, Varey and Kahneman introduced the method of evaluating moments and episodes as a way to capture \"experiences extended across time\". While Kahneman continued to study decision-making (e.g., Kahneman, 1992, 1994; Kahneman & Lovallo, 1993), hedonic psychology was the focus of an increasing number of publications (e.g., Fredrickson & Kahneman, 1993; Kahneman, Fredrickson, Schreiber & Redelemeier, 1993; Kahneman, Wakker & Sarin, 1997; Redelmeier & Kahneman, 1996), culminating in a volume co-edited with [[Ed Diener]] and [[Norbert Schwarz]], scholars of affect and well-being.{{sfn|Kahneman|Diener|Schwarz|1999}}\n\nWith David Schkade, Kahneman developed the notion of the [[focusing illusion]] (Kahneman & Schkade, 1998; Kahneman, Krueger, Schkade, Schwarz & Stone, 2006) to explain in part the mistakes people make when estimating the effects of different scenarios on their future happiness (also known as [[affective forecasting]], which has been studied extensively by [[Daniel Gilbert (psychologist)|Daniel Gilbert]]). The \"illusion\" occurs when people consider the impact of one specific factor on their overall happiness, they tend to greatly exaggerate the importance of that factor, while overlooking the numerous other factors that would in most cases have a greater impact. A good example is provided by Kahneman and Schkade's 1998 paper \"Does living in [[California]] make people happy? A focusing illusion in judgments of life satisfaction\". In that paper, students in the Midwest and in California reported similar levels of life satisfaction, but the Midwesterners thought their Californian peers would be happier. The only distinguishing information the Midwestern students had when making these judgments was the fact that their hypothetical peers lived in California.

Smith]]). His empirical findings challenge the assumption of human rationality prevailing in modern economic theory.\n\nWith [[Amos Tversky]] and others, Kahneman established a [[cognitive]] basis for common human errors that arise from [[heuristics in judgment and decision making|heuristics and biases]] (Kahneman & Tversky, 1973; Kahneman, [[Paul Slovic|Slovic]] & Tversky, 1982; Tversky & Kahneman, 1974), and developed [[prospect theory]] (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979).\n\nIn 2011, he was named by ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine in its list of top global thinkers.<ref name=\"ForeignPolicy November 2011\" /> In the same year, his book ''[[Thinking, Fast and Slow]]'', which summarizes much of his research, was published and became a best seller.<ref>{{cite web | title = The New York Times Best Seller List \u2013 December 25, 2011 | url = http://www.hawes.com/2011/2011-12-25.pdf | website = www.hawes.com | accessdate = 2014-08-17}}</ref>\n\nHe is professor emeritus of psychology and public affairs at [[Princeton University]]'s [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs|Woodrow Wilson School]].

He spent his childhood years in [[Paris]], [[France]], where his parents had emigrated from [[Lithuania]] in the early 1920s. Kahneman and his family were in Paris when it was [[Paris in World War II|occupied by Nazi Germany]] in 1940. His father, Efrayim, was picked up in the first major round-up of [[French Jews]], but he was released after six weeks due to the intervention of his employer, [[Eug\u00e8ne Schueller]].<ref name=\"MLTUP2016\">{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Michael |title=[[The Undoing Project|The Undoing Project: A Friendship That Changed Our Minds]] |location= New York |publisher=  Penguin Random House |orig-year=1st pub. in the USA by W.W. Norton & Company, Inc, 2016 |isbn=978-0-14-198304-2 |year= 2017}}</ref>{{rp|52}} The family was on the run for the remainder of the war, and survived, except for the death of Kahneman's father due to [[diabetes]] in 1944. Kahneman and his family then moved to [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandatory Palestine]] in 1948, just before the  creation of the state of Israel (Kahneman, 2003).\n\nKahneman has written of his experience in [[Vichy France|Nazi-occupied France]], explaining in part why he entered the field of psychology:\n\n<blockquote>It must have been late 1941 or early 1942. Jews were required to wear the Star of David and to obey a 6&nbsp;p.m. curfew. I had gone to play with a Christian friend and had stayed too late. I turned my brown sweater inside out to walk the few blocks home. As I was walking down an empty street, I saw a German soldier approaching. He was wearing the black uniform that I had been told to fear more than others \u2013 the one worn by specially recruited SS soldiers. As I came closer to him, trying to walk fast, I noticed that he was looking at me intently. Then he beckoned me over, picked me up, and hugged me. I was terrified that he would notice the star inside my sweater. He was speaking to me with great emotion, in German. When he put me down, he opened his wallet, showed me a picture of a boy, and gave me some money. I went home more certain than ever that my mother was right: people were endlessly complicated and interesting. (Kahneman, 2003, p. 417)</blockquote>\n\nKahneman received his bachelor of science degree with a major in [[psychology]], and a minor in [[mathematics]] from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] in 1954. After earning his undergraduate degree, he served in the psychology department of the [[Israeli Defense Forces]]. One of his responsibilities was to evaluate candidates for officer's training school, and to develop tests and measures for this purpose. In 1958, he went to the United States to study for his [[PhD]] in Psychology from the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. His 1961 dissertation, advised by [[Susan M. Ervin-Tripp|Susan Ervin]], examined relations between adjectives in the [[semantic differential]] and \"allowed me to engage in two of my favorite pursuits: the analysis of complex correlational structures and [[Fortran|FORTRAN]] programming,\" as he would later recall.<ref name=\"NobelPrize Bio 2002\"/>\n\n===Academic career===\n\n====Cognitive psychology====\nKahneman began his academic career as a lecturer in psychology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1961.<ref name=\"NobelPrize Bio 2002\"/> He was promoted to senior lecturer in 1966.\nHis early work focused on visual perception and attention. For example, his first publication in the prestigious journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' was entitled \"Pupil Diameter and Load on Memory\" (Kahneman & Beatty, 1966). During this period, Kahneman was a visiting scientist at the [[University of Michigan]] (1965\u201366) and the Applied Psychology Research Unit in [[Cambridge]] (1968/1969, summers). He was a fellow at the Center for Cognitive Studies, and a lecturer in [[cognitive psychology]] at [[Harvard University]] in 1966/1967.\n\n====Judgment and decision-making====\nThis period marks the beginning of Kahneman's lengthy collaboration with [[Amos Tversky]]. Together, Kahneman and Tversky published a series of seminal articles in the general field of judgment and [[decision-making]], culminating in the publication of their [[prospect theory]] in 1979 (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). Kahneman was ultimately awarded the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics]] in 2002 for his work on prospect theory. Following this, the pair teamed with [[Paul Slovic]] to edit a compilation entitled \"Judgement Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases\" (1982) that proved to be an important summary of their work and of other recent advances that had influenced their thinking.\n\nIn his Nobel biography, Kahneman states that his collaboration with Tversky began after Kahneman had invited Tversky to give a guest lecture to one of Kahneman's seminars at Hebrew University in 1968 or 1969.<ref name=\"NobelPrize Bio 2002\"/> Their first jointly written paper, \"Belief in the Law of Small Numbers,\" was published in 1971 (Tversky & Kahneman, 1971). They published seven articles in peer-reviewed journals in the years 1971\u20131979. Aside from \"Prospect Theory,\" the most important of these articles was \"Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases\" (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974), which was published in the prestigious journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' and introduced the notion of [[anchoring]].\n\nKahneman left Hebrew University in 1978 to take a position at the [[University of British Columbia]].<ref name=\"NobelPrize Bio 2002\"/>\n\n====Behavioral economics====\nKahneman and Tversky were both fellows at the [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]] at [[Stanford University]] in the academic year 1977\u20131978. A young economist named [[Richard Thaler]] was a visiting professor at the Stanford branch of the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] during that same year. According to Kahneman, \"[Thaler and I] soon became friends, and have ever since had a considerable influence on each other's thinking\" (Kahneman, 2003, p.&nbsp;437). Building on prospect theory and Kahneman and Tversky's body of work, Thaler published \"Toward a Positive Theory of Consumer Choice\" in 1980, a paper which Kahneman has called \"the founding text in [[behavioral economics]]\" (Kahneman, 2003, p.&nbsp;438).\n\nKahneman and Tversky became heavily involved in the development of this new approach to economic theory, and their involvement in this movement had the effect of reducing the intensity and exclusivity of their earlier period of joint collaboration. They would continue to publish together until the end of Tversky's life, but the period when Kahneman published almost exclusively with Tversky ended in 1983, when he published two papers with [[Anne Treisman]], his wife since 1978.\n\n====Hedonic psychology====\nIn the 1990s, Kahneman's research focus began to gradually shift in emphasis towards the field of \"[[hedonic psychology]]\". This subfield is closely related to the [[positive psychology]] movement, which was steadily gaining in popularity at the time. According to Kahneman and colleagues,\n<blockquote>Hedonic psychology...is the study of what makes experiences and life pleasant or unpleasant. It is concerned with feelings of pleasure and pain, of interest and boredom, of joy and sorrow, and of satisfaction and dissatisfaction. It is also concerned with the whole range of circumstances, from the biological to the societal, that occasion suffering and enjoyment.{{sfn|Kahneman|Diener|Schwarz|1999|p=ix}}</blockquote>\n\nIt is difficult to determine precisely when Kahneman's research began to focus on hedonics, although it likely stemmed from his work on the economic notion of [[utility]]. After publishing multiple articles and chapters in all but one of the years spanning the period 1979\u20131986 (for a total of 23 published works in 8 years), Kahneman published exactly one chapter during the years 1987\u20131989. After this hiatus, articles on utility and the psychology of utility began to appear (e.g., Kahneman & Snell, 1990; Kahneman & Thaler, 1991; Kahneman & Varey, 1991). In 1992, Varey and Kahneman introduced the method of evaluating moments and episodes as a way to capture \"experiences extended across time\". While Kahneman continued to study decision-making (e.g., Kahneman, 1992, 1994; Kahneman & Lovallo, 1993), hedonic psychology was the focus of an increasing number of publications (e.g., Fredrickson & Kahneman, 1993; Kahneman, Fredrickson, Schreiber & Redelemeier, 1993; Kahneman, Wakker & Sarin, 1997; Redelmeier & Kahneman, 1996), culminating in a volume co-edited with [[Ed Diener]] and [[Norbert Schwarz]], scholars of affect and well-being.{{sfn|Kahneman|Diener|Schwarz|1999}}\n\nWith David Schkade, Kahneman developed the notion of the [[focusing illusion]] (Kahneman & Schkade, 1998; Kahneman, Krueger, Schkade, Schwarz & Stone, 2006) to explain in part the mistakes people make when estimating the effects of different scenarios on their future happiness (also known as [[affective forecasting]], which has been studied extensively by [[Daniel Gilbert (psychologist)|Daniel Gilbert]]). The \"illusion\" occurs when people consider the impact of one specific factor on their overall happiness, they tend to greatly exaggerate the importance of that factor, while overlooking the numerous other factors that would in most cases have a greater impact. A good example is provided by Kahneman and Schkade's 1998 paper \"Does living in [[California]] make people happy? A focusing illusion in judgments of life satisfaction\". In that paper, students in the Midwest and in California reported similar levels of life satisfaction, but the Midwesterners thought their Californian peers would be happier. The only distinguishing information the Midwestern students had when making these judgments was the fact that their hypothetical peers lived in California. Thus, they \"focused\" on this distinction, thereby overestimating the effect of the weather in California on its residents' satisfaction with life.\n\n====Life satisfaction====\nKahneman has said that in reality humans pursue [[life satisfaction]], which \u201cis connected to a large degree to social yardsticks\u2013achieving goals, meeting expectations.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium.MAGAZINE-why-nobel-prize-winner-daniel-kahneman-gave-up-on-happiness-1.6528513|title=Why Nobel Prize Winner Daniel Kahneman Gave Up on Happiness|first=Amir|last=Mandel|date=October 7, 2018|via=Haaretz}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/1503207/a-nobel-prize-winning-psychologist-defines-happiness-versus-satisfaction/|title=A Nobel Prize-winning psychologist says most people don\u2019t really want to be happy|first=Ephrat|last=Livni|website=Quartz}}</ref>\n\n===Teaching===\nKahneman is a senior scholar and faculty member emeritus at [[Princeton University]]'s [[Princeton University Department of Psychology|Department of Psychology]] and [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs]].
