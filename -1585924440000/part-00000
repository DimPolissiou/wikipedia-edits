Its [[Ruby character]] extension to HTML is also accepted as a module in W3C XHTML 1.1, though it is not found in all versions of W3C HTML.\n\nMicrosoft submitted several other features of IE for consideration by the W3C for standardization. These include the 'behaviour' CSS property, which connects the HTML elements with JScript behaviours (known as HTML Components, HTC); [[HTMLplusTIME|HTML+TIME]] profile, which adds timing and media synchronization support to HTML documents (similar to the W3C [[XHTMLplusSMIL|XHTML+SMIL]]), and the [[VML]] [[vector graphics]] file format. However, all were rejected, at least in their original forms; VML was subsequently combined with [[PGML]] (proposed by [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] and [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]]), resulting in the W3C-approved SVG format, one of the few vector image formats being used on the web, which IE did not support until version 9.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.codedread.com/svg-support.php|title=SVG Support Tables|last=Schiller|first=Jeff|work=codedread.com|accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOther non-standard behaviours include: support for vertical text, but in a syntax different from W3C CSS3 candidate recommendation, support for a variety of image effects<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webfx.eae.net/tools/filtertool.html |title=Filter Tool (WebFX) |author= |date=May 12, 2005 |publisher=webfx.eae.net |accessdate=}}</ref> and page transitions, which are not found in W3C CSS, support for [[obfuscated code|obfuscated]] script code, in particular [[JScript.Encode]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions//cbfz3598(v=vs.85)|title=Using Script Encoder|date=October 24, 2011|work=Microsoft Docs|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref> as well as support for [[font embedding|embedding]] [[Embedded OpenType|EOT]] fonts in [[Font embedding on the Web|web pages]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/typography/web/embedding/default.aspx|title=Font Embedding for the Web|date=February 26, 2001|work=Microsoft Typography|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050428064515/http://www.microsoft.com/typography/web/embedding/default.aspx|archive-date=April 28, 2005|url-status=|accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Favicon===\nSupport for [[favicon]]s was first added in Internet Explorer 5.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537656(VS.85).aspx|title=How to Add a Shortcut Icon to a Web Page|work=[[MSDN]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217122653/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537656(VS.85).aspx|archive-date=December 17, 2008|url-status=|accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref> Internet Explorer supports favicons in [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], static [[GIF]] and [[ICO (file format)|native Windows icon]] formats.

Internet Explorer is also a user interface for FTP, with operations similar to that of Windows Explorer. [[Pop-up blocking]] and [[tabbed browsing]] were added respectively in Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 7. Tabbed browsing can also be added to older versions by installing [[MSN Search Toolbar]] or [[Yahoo Toolbar]].\n\n===Cache===\n{{Main|Temporary Internet Files|Index.dat}}\n\nInternet Explorer caches visited content in the [[Temporary Internet Files]] folder to allow quicker access (or offline access) to previously visited pages. The content is indexed in a database file, known as [[Index.dat]]. Multiple Index.dat files exist which index different content\u2014visited content, [[web feed]]s, visited [[URL]]s, cookies, etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/wndp/archive/2006/08/04/WinInet_Index_dat.aspx|title=A bit about WinInet's Index.dat|author=Windows Core Networking Team|date=August 4, 2006|website=[[Microsoft Developer Network]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112205144/http://blogs.msdn.com/wndp/archive/2006/08/04/WinInet_Index_dat.aspx|archive-date=January 12, 2008|url-status=|accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nPrior to IE7, clearing the cache used to clear the index but the files themselves were not reliably removed, posing a potential security and privacy risk. In IE7 and later, when the cache is cleared, the cache files are more reliably removed, and the index.dat file is overwritten with null bytes.\n\nCaching has been improved in IE9.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ie/2011/03/17/internet-explorer-9-network-performance-improvements/|title=Internet Explorer 9 Network Performance Improvements|date=March 17, 2011|website=[[Microsoft Developer Network]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Group Policy===\n{{Main|Group Policy}}\nInternet Explorer is fully configurable using [[Group Policy]].  Administrators of [[Windows Server domain]]s (for domain-joined computers) or the local computer can apply and enforce a variety of settings on computers that affect the user interface (such as disabling menu items and individual configuration options), as well as underlying security features such as downloading of files, zone configuration, per-site settings, ActiveX control behaviour and others.  Policy settings can be configured for each user and for each machine. Internet Explorer also supports [[Integrated Windows Authentication]].\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:IExplore.svg|thumb|right|The architecture of IE8. Previous versions had a similar architecture, except that both tabs and the UI were within the same process. Consequently, each browser window could have only one \"tab process\".]]\nInternet Explorer uses a [[software componentry|componentized]] architecture built on the [[Component Object Model]] (COM) technology. It consists of several major components, each of which is contained in a separate [[Dynamic-link library]] (DLL) and exposes a set of COM [[interface (computing)|programming interfaces]] hosted by the Internet Explorer main executable, {{samp|iexplore.exe}}:<ref name=\"architecture\">{{cite web|url = http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa741312.aspx |title = Internet Explorer Architecture | publisher = [[MSDN]] |accessdate = January 10, 2007}}</ref>\n* {{samp|WinInet.dll}} is the protocol handler for [[HTTP]], [[HTTPS]] and [[FTP]]. It handles all network communication over these protocols.\n* {{samp|URLMon.dll}} is responsible for MIME-type handling and download of web content, and provides a thread-safe wrapper around WinInet.dll and other protocol implementations.\n* {{samp|MSHTML.dll}} houses the [[Trident (rendering engine)|Trident]] [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering engine]] introduced in Internet Explorer 4, which is responsible for displaying the pages on-screen and handling the Document Object Model of the web pages. MSHTML.dll parses the HTML/CSS file and creates the internal DOM tree representation of it. It also exposes a set of [[API]]s for runtime inspection and modification of the DOM tree.  The DOM tree is further processed by a layout engine which then renders the internal representation on screen.\n* {{samp|IEFrame.dll}} contains the user interface and window of IE in Internet Explorer 7 and above.\n* {{samp|ShDocVw.dll}} provides the navigation, local caching and history functionalities for the browser.\n* {{samp|BrowseUI.dll}} is responsible for rendering the browser user interface such as menus and toolbars.<ref>{{cite web| first = Chris |last = Wilson | publisher = MSDN Channel9 | accessdate = March 7, 2008 | url = http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=388331 | title = Inside IE8 Beta 1 for Developers}}</ref>\n\nInternet Explorer does not include any native scripting functionality. Rather, {{samp|MSHTML.dll}} exposes an API that permits a programmer to develop a scripting environment to be plugged-in and to access the DOM tree. Internet Explorer 8 includes the bindings for the [[Active Scripting]] engine, which is a part of [[Microsoft Windows]] and allows any language implemented as an Active Scripting module to be used for client-side scripting. By default, only the JScript and [[VBScript]] modules are provided; third party implementations like [[ScreamingMonkey]] (for ECMAScript 4 support) can also be used. Microsoft also makes available the [[Microsoft Silverlight]] runtime (not supported in [[Windows RT]]) that allows [[CLI languages]], including [[Dynamic Language Runtime|DLR]]-based dynamic languages like [[IronPython]] and [[IronRuby]], to be used for client-side scripting.\n\nInternet Explorer 8 introduces some major architectural changes, called ''Loosely Coupled IE'' (LCIE). LCIE separates the main window process (frame process) from the processes hosting the different web applications in different tabs (tab processes). A frame process can create multiple tab processes, each of which can be of a different [[Mandatory Integrity Control|integrity level]]; each tab process can host multiple web sites. The processes use asynchronous [[Inter-Process Communication]] to synchronize themselves. Generally, there will be a single frame process for all web sites. In [[Windows Vista]] with Protected Mode turned on, however, opening privileged content (such as local HTML pages) will create a new tab process as it will not be constrained by Protected Mode.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ie/2008/03/11/ie8-and-loosely-coupled-ie-lcie/|title=IE8 and Loosely Coupled IE|last=Zeigler|first=Andy|date=March 11, 2008|website=[[Microsoft Developer Network]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Extensibility==\nInternet Explorer exposes a set of Component Object Model (COM) interfaces that allows [[Plug-in (computing)|add-ons]] to extend the functionality of the browser.<ref name=\"architecture\" /> Extensibility is divided into two types: Browser extensibility and content extensibility. Browser extensibility involves adding context menu entries, toolbars, menu items or [[Browser Helper Objects]] (BHO). BHOs are used to extend the feature set of the browser, whereas the other extensibility options are used to expose that feature in the user interface. Content extensibility adds support for non-native content formats.<ref name=\"architecture\" /> It allows Internet Explorer to handle new [[file format]]s and new [[network protocol|protocols]], e.g. [[WebM]] or SPDY.<ref name=\"architecture\" /> In addition, web pages can integrate [[software widget|widgets]] known as ActiveX controls which run on Windows only but have vast potentials to extend the content capabilities; [[Adobe Flash Player]] and Microsoft Silverlight are examples.<ref name=\"architecture\" /> Add-ons can be installed either locally, or directly by a web site.\n\nSince malicious add-ons can compromise the security of a system, Internet Explorer implements several safeguards. Internet Explorer 6 with Service Pack 2 and later feature an Add-on Manager for enabling or disabling individual add-ons, complemented by a \"No Add-Ons\" mode. [[Security and safety features new to Windows Vista#Application isolation|Starting with Windows Vista]], Internet Explorer and its BHOs run with restricted privileges and are isolated from the rest of the system. Internet Explorer 9 introduced a new component&nbsp;\u2013 Add-on Performance Advisor. Add-on Performance Advisor shows a notification when one or more of installed add-ons exceed a pre-set performance threshold. The notification appears in the Notification Bar when the user launches the browser. Windows 8 and Windows RT introduce a [[Metro-style app|Metro-style version]] of Internet Explorer that is entirely sandboxed and does not run add-ons at all.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/australian-technology/a-look-at-internet-explorer-10-on-windows-rt/|title = A look at Internet Explorer 10 on Windows RT|date = January 20, 2013|accessdate = |website = [[TechRepublic]]|publisher = [[CBS Interactive]]|last = McSherry|first = Tony}}</ref> In addition, Windows RT cannot download or install ActiveX controls at all; although existing ones bundled with Windows RT still run in the traditional version of Internet Explorer.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nInternet Explorer itself can be hosted by other applications via a set of COM interfaces. This can be used to embed the browser functionality inside a computer program or create [[Internet Explorer shell]]s.<ref name=\"architecture\" />\n\n==Security==\n{{See also|Browser security}}\nInternet Explorer uses a zone-based [[computer security|security]] framework that groups sites based on certain conditions, including whether it is an Internet- or intranet-based site as well as a user-editable whitelist. Security restrictions are applied per zone; all the sites in a zone are subject to the restrictions.\n\nInternet Explorer 6 SP2 onwards uses the ''Attachment Execution Service'' of Microsoft Windows to mark executable files downloaded from the Internet as being potentially unsafe. Accessing files marked as such will prompt the user to make an explicit trust decision to execute the file, as executables originating from the Internet can be potentially unsafe. This helps in preventing accidental installation of malware.\n\nInternet Explorer 7 introduced the phishing filter, that restricts access to [[phishing]] sites unless the user overrides the decision. With version 8, it also blocks access to sites known to host [[malware]]. Downloads are also checked to see if they are known to be malware-infected.\n\nIn Windows Vista, Internet Explorer by default runs in what is called ''Protected Mode'', where the privileges of the browser itself are severely restricted\u2014it cannot make any system-wide changes. One can optionally turn this mode off but this is not recommended. This also effectively restricts the privileges of any add-ons. As a result, even if the browser or any add-on is compromised, the damage the security breach can cause is limited.\n\nPatches and updates to the browser are released periodically and made available through the Windows Update service, as well as through Automatic Updates. Although security patches continue to be released for a range of platforms, most feature additions and security infrastructure improvements are only made available on operating systems which are in Microsoft's mainstream support phase.\n\nOn December 16, 2008, [[Trend Micro]] recommended users switch to rival browsers until an emergency patch was released to fix a potential security risk which \"could allow outside users to take control of a person's computer and steal their passwords\". Microsoft representatives countered this recommendation, claiming that \"0.02% of internet sites\" were affected by the flaw. A fix for the issue was released the following day with the Security Update for Internet Explorer KB960714, on Microsoft Windows Update.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/breaking-news/world/north-america/security-risk-detected-in-internet-explorer-software-14110209.html |title=Security risk detected in Internet Explorer software |date=December 16, 2008 |newspaper=[[Belfast Telegraph]] }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7784908.stm |newspaper=BBC News | title=Serious security flaw found in IE | date=December 16, 2008 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Germany's Federal Office for Information Security, known by its German initials, BSI, advised \"temporary use of alternative browsers\" because of a \"critical security hole\" in Microsoft's software that could allow hackers to remotely plant and run malicious code on Windows PCs. <ref>{{Cite news|title=Business Technology: Microsoft's Internet Explorer Is Under Fire in Europe|last=Wingfield|first=Nick|date=January 19, 2010|work=The Wall Street Journal|last2=McGroarty|first2=Patrick}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, a report by Accuvant, funded by Google, rated the security (based on sandboxing) of Internet Explorer worse than [[Google Chrome]] but better than [[Mozilla Firefox]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/12/09/chrome_ie_firefox_security_bakeoff|title=Chrome is the most secured browser \u2013 new study|website=The Register|first=Dan|last=Goodin|date=December 9, 2011|accessdate=October 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Accuvant Study Finds Chrome is Most Secure Browser|url=http://www.esecurityplanet.com/browser-security/accuvant-study-finds-chrome-is-most-secure-browser.html|date=December 13, 2011|publisher=eSecurity Planet|accessdate=May 22, 2012}}</ref>\n\nA 2017 browser security white paper comparing Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and [[Internet Explorer 11]] by X41 D-Sec in 2017 came to similar conclusions, also based on sandboxing and support of legacy web technologies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://browser-security.x41-dsec.de/X41-Browser-Security-White-Paper.pdf|title=Browser Security White Paper|publisher=X41-Dsec GmbH|date=September 18, 2017|accessdate=September 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Security vulnerabilities===\n{{See also|Comparison of web browsers#Security and vulnerabilities}}\nInternet Explorer has been subjected to many security vulnerabilities and concerns:<!-- Now, in one sentence, we answer how the security issues, enumerated and detailed ELSEWHERE, affect people such that the volume of criticism for IE is unusually high --> much of the [[spyware]], [[adware]], and [[computer virus]]es across the Internet are made possible by exploitable bugs and flaws in the security architecture of Internet Explorer, sometimes requiring nothing more than viewing of a malicious web page in order to install themselves. This is known as a \"[[drive-by download|drive-by install]]\". There are also attempts to trick the user into installing malicious software by misrepresenting the software's true purpose in the description section of an ActiveX security alert.\n\nA number of security flaws affecting IE originated not in the browser itself, but ActiveX-based add-ons used by it. Because the add-ons have the same privilege as IE, the flaws can be as critical as browser flaws. This has led to the ActiveX-based architecture being criticized for being fault-prone. By 2005, some experts maintained that the dangers of ActiveX have been overstated and there were safeguards in place.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Security/The-Lame-Blame-of-ActiveX/\n|title=The Lame Blame of ActiveX\n|date=April 14, 2005\n|accessdate=April 7, 2006\n|work = Security\u2014Opinions\n|publisher=eWeek\n|last=Seltzer\n|first=Larry\n}}</ref> In 2006, new techniques using [[automated testing]] found more than a hundred vulnerabilities in standard Microsoft ActiveX components.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.securityfocus.com/news/11403\n|title=ActiveX security faces storm before calm\n|date=July 31, 2006\n|accessdate=July 11, 2009\n|publisher=Security Focus\n|last=Lemos\n|first=Robert\n}}</ref> Security features introduced in Internet Explorer 7 mitigated some of these vulnerabilities.\n\nIn 2008, Internet Explorer had a number of published security vulnerabilities.

browsers]] according to [[StatCounter]] ]]\n[[File:Internet-explorer-usage-data.svg|thumb|left|300px|Historical market share of Internet Explorer]]\n\nThe adoption rate of Internet Explorer seems to be closely related to that of Microsoft Windows, as it is the default web browser that comes with Windows. Since the integration of Internet Explorer 2.0 with Windows 95 OSR 1 in 1996, and especially after version 4.0's release in 1997, the adoption was greatly accelerated: from below 20% in 1996, to about 40% in 1998, and over 80% in 2000. This made Microsoft the winner in the infamous '[[first browser war]]' against Netscape. [[Netscape Navigator]] was the dominant browser during 1995 and until 1997, but rapidly lost share to IE starting in 1998, and eventually slipped behind in 1999. The integration of IE with Windows led to a lawsuit by [[AOL]], Netscape's owner, accusing Microsoft of unfair competition. The infamous case was eventually won by AOL but by then it was too late, as Internet Explorer had already become the dominant browser.\n\nInternet Explorer peaked during 2002 and 2003, with about 95% share. Its first notable competitor after beating Netscape was Firefox from [[Mozilla]], which itself was an offshoot from Netscape.\n\nFirefox 1.0 had surpassed Internet Explorer 5 in early 2005, with Firefox 1.0 at roughly 8 percent market share.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?qprid=2&qpmr=40&qpdt=1&qpct=3&qptimeframe=M&qpsp=74 |title=Market share for browsers, operating systems and search engines |author= |date= |publisher=marketshare.hitslink.com |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nApproximate usage over time based on various usage share counters averaged for the year overall, or for the fourth quarter, or for the last month in the year depending on availability of reference.<ref name=\"nashare\">{{cite web|url=http://marketshare.hitslink.com/ |title=Market share for browsers, operating systems and search engines |publisher=marketshare.hitslink.com |accessdate=February 9, 2011}}</ref><ref name=zdnetearly>Borland, John.

Because of the use of COM, it is possible to embed web-browsing functionality in third-party applications. Hence, there are a number of Internet Explorer shells, and a number of content-centric applications like [[RealPlayer]] also use Internet Explorer's web browsing module for viewing web pages within the applications.\n\n==Removal==\n{{Main|Removal of Internet Explorer}}\nWhile a major upgrade of Internet Explorer can be uninstalled in a traditional way if the user has saved the original application files for installation, the matter of uninstalling the version of the browser that has shipped with an operating system remains a controversial one.\n\nThe idea of removing a stock install of Internet Explorer from a Windows system was proposed during the ''[[United States v. Microsoft Corp. (2001)|United States v. Microsoft Corp.]]'' case. One of Microsoft's arguments during the trial was that removing Internet Explorer from Windows may result in system instability. Indeed, programs that depend on libraries installed by IE, including Windows help and support system, fail to function without IE. Before Windows Vista, it was not possible to run [[Windows Update]] without IE because the service used ActiveX technology, which no other web browser supports.\n\n==Impersonation by malware==\nThe popularity of Internet Explorer has led to the appearance of malware abusing its name. On January 28, 2011, a fake Internet Explorer browser calling itself \"Internet Explorer \u2013 Emergency Mode\" appeared. It closely resembles the real Internet Explorer, but has fewer buttons and no search bar. If a user attempts to launch any other browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] or the real Internet Explorer, this browser will be loaded instead. It also displays a fake error message, claiming that the computer is infected with malware and Internet Explorer has entered \"Emergency Mode\". It blocks access to legitimate sites such as [[Google]] if the user tries to access them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.im-infected.com/hijacker/internet-explorer-emergency-mode.html |title=IE

It also provides its own dialect of [[ECMAScript]] called [[JScript]].\n\nInternet Explorer was criticised by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] for its limited support for SVG, which is promoted by [[W3C]].<ref name=\"TBLcrit\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/26646919|title=Creator of Web spots a flaw in Internet Explorer|last=Svensson|first=Peter|date=September 10, 2008|website=NBC News|accessdate=November 16, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Non-standard extensions===\nInternet Explorer has introduced an array of proprietary extensions to many of the standards, including HTML, CSS, and the DOM.  This has resulted in a number of web pages that appear broken in standards-compliant web browsers and has introduced the need for a \"quirks mode\" to allow for rendering improper elements meant for Internet Explorer in these other browsers.\n\nInternet Explorer has introduced a number of extensions to the DOM that have been adopted by other browsers. \n\nThese include the innerHTML property, which provides access to the HTML string within an element, which was part of IE 5 and was standardized as part of HTML 5 roughly 15 years later after all other browsers implemented it for compatibility<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.xul.fr/en/html5/innerhtml.php|title=innerHTML and compatibility|website=www.xul.fr}}</ref>, the XMLHttpRequest object, which allows the sending of HTTP request and receiving of HTTP response, and may be used to perform [[AJAX]], and the designMode attribute of the contentDocument object, which enables rich text editing of HTML documents.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Some of these functionalities were not possible until the introduction of the W3C DOM methods. Its [[Ruby character]] extension to HTML is also accepted as a module in W3C XHTML 1.1, though it is not found in all versions of W3C HTML.\n\nMicrosoft submitted several other features of IE for consideration by the W3C for standardization. These include the 'behaviour' CSS property, which connects the HTML elements with JScript behaviours (known as HTML Components, HTC); [[HTMLplusTIME|HTML+TIME]] profile, which adds timing and media synchronization support to HTML documents (similar to the W3C [[XHTMLplusSMIL|XHTML+SMIL]]), and the [[VML]] [[vector graphics]] file format. However, all were rejected, at least in their original forms; VML was subsequently combined with [[PGML]] (proposed by [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] and [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]]), resulting in the W3C-approved SVG format, one of the few vector image formats being used on the web, which IE did not support until version 9.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.codedread.com/svg-support.php|title=SVG Support Tables|last=Schiller|first=Jeff|work=codedread.com|accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOther non-standard behaviours include: support for vertical text, but in a syntax different from W3C CSS3 candidate recommendation, support for a variety of image effects<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webfx.eae.net/tools/filtertool.html |title=Filter Tool (WebFX) |author= |date=May 12, 2005 |publisher=webfx.eae.net |accessdate=}}</ref> and page transitions, which are not found in W3C CSS, support for [[obfuscated code|obfuscated]] script code, in particular [[JScript.Encode]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions//cbfz3598(v=vs.85)|title=Using Script Encoder|date=October 24, 2011|work=Microsoft Docs|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref> as well as support for [[font embedding|embedding]] [[Embedded OpenType|EOT]] fonts in [[Font embedding on the Web|web pages]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/typography/web/embedding/default.aspx|title=Font Embedding for the Web|date=February 26, 2001|work=Microsoft Typography|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050428064515/http://www.microsoft.com/typography/web/embedding/default.aspx|archive-date=April 28, 2005|url-status=|accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Favicon===\nSupport for [[favicon]]s was first added in Internet Explorer 5.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537656(VS.85).aspx|title=How to Add a Shortcut Icon to a Web Page|work=[[MSDN]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217122653/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537656(VS.85).aspx|archive-date=December 17, 2008|url-status=|accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref> Internet Explorer supports favicons in [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], static [[GIF]] and [[ICO (file format)|native Windows icon]] formats.

Internet Explorer is also a user interface for FTP, with operations similar to that of Windows Explorer.

Tabbed browsing can also be added to older versions by installing [[MSN Search Toolbar]] or [[Yahoo Toolbar]].\n\n===Cache===\n{{Main|Temporary Internet Files|Index.dat}}\n\nInternet Explorer caches visited content in the [[Temporary Internet Files]] folder to allow quicker access (or offline access) to previously visited pages.

Multiple Index.dat files exist which index different content\u2014visited content, [[web feed]]s, visited [[URL]]s, cookies, etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/wndp/archive/2006/08/04/WinInet_Index_dat.aspx|title=A bit about WinInet's Index.dat|author=Windows Core Networking Team|date=August 4, 2006|website=[[Microsoft Developer Network]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112205144/http://blogs.msdn.com/wndp/archive/2006/08/04/WinInet_Index_dat.aspx|archive-date=January 12, 2008|url-status=|accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nPrior to IE7, clearing the cache used to clear the index but the files themselves were not reliably removed, posing a potential security and privacy risk. In IE7 and later, when the cache is cleared, the cache files are more reliably removed, and the index.dat file is overwritten with null bytes.\n\nCaching has been improved in IE9.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ie/2011/03/17/internet-explorer-9-network-performance-improvements/|title=Internet Explorer 9 Network Performance Improvements|date=March 17, 2011|website=[[Microsoft Developer Network]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Group Policy===\n{{Main|Group Policy}}\nInternet Explorer is fully configurable using [[Group Policy]].  Administrators of [[Windows Server domain]]s (for domain-joined computers) or the local computer can apply and enforce a variety of settings on computers that affect the user interface (such as disabling menu items and individual configuration options), as well as underlying security features such as downloading of files, zone configuration, per-site settings, ActiveX control behaviour and others.  Policy settings can be configured for each user and for each machine. Internet Explorer also supports [[Integrated Windows Authentication]].\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:IExplore.svg|thumb|right|The architecture of IE8. Previous versions had a similar architecture, except that both tabs and the UI were within the same process. Consequently, each browser window could have only one \"tab process\".]]\nInternet Explorer uses a [[software componentry|componentized]] architecture built on the [[Component Object Model]] (COM) technology. It consists of several major components, each of which is contained in a separate [[Dynamic-link library]] (DLL) and exposes a set of COM [[interface (computing)|programming interfaces]] hosted by the Internet Explorer main executable, {{samp|iexplore.exe}}:<ref name=\"architecture\">{{cite web|url = http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa741312.aspx |title = Internet Explorer Architecture | publisher = [[MSDN]] |accessdate = January 10, 2007}}</ref>\n* {{samp|WinInet.dll}} is the protocol handler for [[HTTP]], [[HTTPS]] and [[FTP]]. It handles all network communication over these protocols.\n* {{samp|URLMon.dll}} is responsible for MIME-type handling and download of web content, and provides a thread-safe wrapper around WinInet.dll and other protocol implementations.\n* {{samp|MSHTML.dll}} houses the [[Trident (rendering engine)|Trident]] [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering engine]] introduced in Internet Explorer 4, which is responsible for displaying the pages on-screen and handling the Document Object Model of the web pages. MSHTML.dll parses the HTML/CSS file and creates the internal DOM tree representation of it. It also exposes a set of [[API]]s for runtime inspection and modification of the DOM tree.  The DOM tree is further processed by a layout engine which then renders the internal representation on screen.\n* {{samp|IEFrame.dll}} contains the user interface and window of IE in Internet Explorer 7 and above.\n* {{samp|ShDocVw.dll}} provides the navigation, local caching and history functionalities for the browser.\n* {{samp|BrowseUI.dll}} is responsible for rendering the browser user interface such as menus and toolbars.<ref>{{cite web| first = Chris |last = Wilson | publisher = MSDN Channel9 | accessdate = March 7, 2008 | url = http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=388331 | title = Inside IE8 Beta 1 for Developers}}</ref>\n\nInternet Explorer does not include any native scripting functionality. Rather, {{samp|MSHTML.dll}} exposes an API that permits a programmer to develop a scripting environment to be plugged-in and to access the DOM tree. Internet Explorer 8 includes the bindings for the [[Active Scripting]] engine, which is a part of [[Microsoft Windows]] and allows any language implemented as an Active Scripting module to be used for client-side scripting. By default, only the JScript and [[VBScript]] modules are provided; third party implementations like [[ScreamingMonkey]] (for ECMAScript 4 support) can also be used. Microsoft also makes available the [[Microsoft Silverlight]] runtime (not supported in [[Windows RT]]) that allows [[CLI languages]], including [[Dynamic Language Runtime|DLR]]-based dynamic languages like [[IronPython]] and [[IronRuby]], to be used for client-side scripting.\n\nInternet Explorer 8 introduces some major architectural changes, called ''Loosely Coupled IE'' (LCIE). LCIE separates the main window process (frame process) from the processes hosting the different web applications in different tabs (tab processes). A frame process can create multiple tab processes, each of which can be of a different [[Mandatory Integrity Control|integrity level]]; each tab process can host multiple web sites. The processes use asynchronous [[Inter-Process Communication]] to synchronize themselves. Generally, there will be a single frame process for all web sites. In [[Windows Vista]] with Protected Mode turned on, however, opening privileged content (such as local HTML pages) will create a new tab process as it will not be constrained by Protected Mode.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ie/2008/03/11/ie8-and-loosely-coupled-ie-lcie/|title=IE8 and Loosely Coupled IE|last=Zeigler|first=Andy|date=March 11, 2008|website=[[Microsoft Developer Network]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Extensibility==\nInternet Explorer exposes a set of Component Object Model (COM) interfaces that allows [[Plug-in (computing)|add-ons]] to extend the functionality of the browser.<ref name=\"architecture\" /> Extensibility is divided into two types: Browser extensibility and content extensibility. Browser extensibility involves adding context menu entries, toolbars, menu items or [[Browser Helper Objects]] (BHO). BHOs are used to extend the feature set of the browser, whereas the other extensibility options are used to expose that feature in the user interface. Content extensibility adds support for non-native content formats.<ref name=\"architecture\" /> It allows Internet Explorer to handle new [[file format]]s and new [[network protocol|protocols]], e.g. [[WebM]] or SPDY.<ref name=\"architecture\" /> In addition, web pages can integrate [[software widget|widgets]] known as ActiveX controls which run on Windows only but have vast potentials to extend the content capabilities; [[Adobe Flash Player]] and Microsoft Silverlight are examples.<ref name=\"architecture\" /> Add-ons can be installed either locally, or directly by a web site.\n\nSince malicious add-ons can compromise the security of a system, Internet Explorer implements several safeguards. Internet Explorer 6 with Service Pack 2 and later feature an Add-on Manager for enabling or disabling individual add-ons, complemented by a \"No Add-Ons\" mode. [[Security and safety features new to Windows Vista#Application isolation|Starting with Windows Vista]], Internet Explorer and its BHOs run with restricted privileges and are isolated from the rest of the system. Internet Explorer 9 introduced a new component&nbsp;\u2013 Add-on Performance Advisor. Add-on Performance Advisor shows a notification when one or more of installed add-ons exceed a pre-set performance threshold. The notification appears in the Notification Bar when the user launches the browser. Windows 8 and Windows RT introduce a [[Metro-style app|Metro-style version]] of Internet Explorer that is entirely sandboxed and does not run add-ons at all.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/australian-technology/a-look-at-internet-explorer-10-on-windows-rt/|title = A look at Internet Explorer 10 on Windows RT|date = January 20, 2013|accessdate = |website = [[TechRepublic]]|publisher = [[CBS Interactive]]|last = McSherry|first = Tony}}</ref> In addition, Windows RT cannot download or install ActiveX controls at all; although existing ones bundled with Windows RT still run in the traditional version of Internet Explorer.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nInternet Explorer itself can be hosted by other applications via a set of COM interfaces. This can be used to embed the browser functionality inside a computer program or create [[Internet Explorer shell]]s.<ref name=\"architecture\" />\n\n==Security==\n{{See also|Browser security}}\nInternet Explorer uses a zone-based [[computer security|security]] framework that groups sites based on certain conditions, including whether it is an Internet- or intranet-based site as well as a user-editable whitelist. Security restrictions are applied per zone; all the sites in a zone are subject to the restrictions.\n\nInternet Explorer 6 SP2 onwards uses the ''Attachment Execution Service'' of Microsoft Windows to mark executable files downloaded from the Internet as being potentially unsafe. Accessing files marked as such will prompt the user to make an explicit trust decision to execute the file, as executables originating from the Internet can be potentially unsafe. This helps in preventing accidental installation of malware.\n\nInternet Explorer 7 introduced the phishing filter, that restricts access to [[phishing]] sites unless the user overrides the decision. With version 8, it also blocks access to sites known to host [[malware]]. Downloads are also checked to see if they are known to be malware-infected.\n\nIn Windows Vista, Internet Explorer by default runs in what is called ''Protected Mode'', where the privileges of the browser itself are severely restricted\u2014it cannot make any system-wide changes. One can optionally turn this mode off but this is not recommended. This also effectively restricts the privileges of any add-ons. As a result, even if the browser or any add-on is compromised, the damage the security breach can cause is limited.\n\nPatches and updates to the browser are released periodically and made available through the Windows Update service, as well as through Automatic Updates. Although security patches continue to be released for a range of platforms, most feature additions and security infrastructure improvements are only made available on operating systems which are in Microsoft's mainstream support phase.\n\nOn December 16, 2008, [[Trend Micro]] recommended users switch to rival browsers until an emergency patch was released to fix a potential security risk which \"could allow outside users to take control of a person's computer and steal their passwords\". Microsoft representatives countered this recommendation, claiming that \"0.02% of internet sites\" were affected by the flaw. A fix for the issue was released the following day with the Security Update for Internet Explorer KB960714, on Microsoft Windows Update.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/breaking-news/world/north-america/security-risk-detected-in-internet-explorer-software-14110209.html |title=Security risk detected in Internet Explorer software |date=December 16, 2008 |newspaper=[[Belfast Telegraph]] }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7784908.stm |newspaper=BBC News | title=Serious security flaw found in IE | date=December 16, 2008 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Germany's Federal Office for Information Security, known by its German initials, BSI, advised \"temporary use of alternative browsers\" because of a \"critical security hole\" in Microsoft's software that could allow hackers to remotely plant and run malicious code on Windows PCs. <ref>{{Cite news|title=Business Technology: Microsoft's Internet Explorer Is Under Fire in Europe|last=Wingfield|first=Nick|date=January 19, 2010|work=The Wall Street Journal|last2=McGroarty|first2=Patrick}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, a report by Accuvant, funded by Google, rated the security (based on sandboxing) of Internet Explorer worse than [[Google Chrome]] but better than [[Mozilla Firefox]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/12/09/chrome_ie_firefox_security_bakeoff|title=Chrome is the most secured browser \u2013 new study|website=The Register|first=Dan|last=Goodin|date=December 9, 2011|accessdate=October 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Accuvant Study Finds Chrome is Most Secure Browser|url=http://www.esecurityplanet.com/browser-security/accuvant-study-finds-chrome-is-most-secure-browser.html|date=December 13, 2011|publisher=eSecurity Planet|accessdate=May 22, 2012}}</ref>\n\nA 2017 browser security white paper comparing Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and [[Internet Explorer 11]] by X41 D-Sec in 2017 came to similar conclusions, also based on sandboxing and support of legacy web technologies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://browser-security.x41-dsec.de/X41-Browser-Security-White-Paper.pdf|title=Browser Security White Paper|publisher=X41-Dsec GmbH|date=September 18, 2017|accessdate=September 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Security vulnerabilities===\n{{See also|Comparison of web browsers#Security and vulnerabilities}}\nInternet Explorer has been subjected to many security vulnerabilities and concerns:<!-- Now, in one sentence, we answer how the security issues, enumerated and detailed ELSEWHERE, affect people such that the volume of criticism for IE is unusually high --> much of the [[spyware]], [[adware]], and [[computer virus]]es across the Internet are made possible by exploitable bugs and flaws in the security architecture of Internet Explorer, sometimes requiring nothing more than viewing of a malicious web page in order to install themselves. This is known as a \"[[drive-by download|drive-by install]]\". There are also attempts to trick the user into installing malicious software by misrepresenting the software's true purpose in the description section of an ActiveX security alert.\n\nA number of security flaws affecting IE originated not in the browser itself, but ActiveX-based add-ons used by it. Because the add-ons have the same privilege as IE, the flaws can be as critical as browser flaws. This has led to the ActiveX-based architecture being criticized for being fault-prone. By 2005, some experts maintained that the dangers of ActiveX have been overstated and there were safeguards in place.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Security/The-Lame-Blame-of-ActiveX/\n|title=The Lame Blame of ActiveX\n|date=April 14, 2005\n|accessdate=April 7, 2006\n|work = Security\u2014Opinions\n|publisher=eWeek\n|last=Seltzer\n|first=Larry\n}}</ref> In 2006, new techniques using [[automated testing]] found more than a hundred vulnerabilities in standard Microsoft ActiveX components.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.securityfocus.com/news/11403\n|title=ActiveX security faces storm before calm\n|date=July 31, 2006\n|accessdate=July 11, 2009\n|publisher=Security Focus\n|last=Lemos\n|first=Robert\n}}</ref> Security features introduced in Internet Explorer 7 mitigated some of these vulnerabilities.\n\nIn 2008, Internet Explorer had a number of published security vulnerabilities.

browsers]] according to [[StatCounter]] ]]\n[[File:Internet-explorer-usage-data.svg|thumb|left|300px|Historical market share of Internet Explorer]]\n\nThe adoption rate of Internet Explorer seems to be closely related to that of Microsoft Windows, as it is the default web browser that comes with Windows. Since the integration of Internet Explorer 2.0 with Windows 95 OSR 1 in 1996, and especially after version 4.0's release in 1997, the adoption was greatly accelerated: from below 20% in 1996, to about 40% in 1998, and over 80% in 2000. This made Microsoft the winner in the infamous '[[first browser war]]' against Netscape. [[Netscape Navigator]] was the dominant browser during 1995 and until 1997, but rapidly lost share to IE starting in 1998, and eventually slipped behind in 1999. The integration of IE with Windows led to a lawsuit by [[AOL]], Netscape's owner, accusing Microsoft of unfair competition. The infamous case was eventually won by AOL but by then it was too late, as Internet Explorer had already become the dominant browser.\n\nInternet Explorer peaked during 2002 and 2003, with about 95% share. Its first notable competitor after beating Netscape was Firefox from [[Mozilla]], which itself was an offshoot from Netscape.\n\nFirefox 1.0 had surpassed Internet Explorer 5 in early 2005, with Firefox 1.0 at roughly 8 percent market share.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?qprid=2&qpmr=40&qpdt=1&qpct=3&qptimeframe=M&qpsp=74 |title=Market share for browsers, operating systems and search engines |author= |date= |publisher=marketshare.hitslink.com |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nApproximate usage over time based on various usage share counters averaged for the year overall, or for the fourth quarter, or for the last month in the year depending on availability of reference.<ref name=\"nashare\">{{cite web|url=http://marketshare.hitslink.com/ |title=Market share for browsers, operating systems and search engines |publisher=marketshare.hitslink.com |accessdate=February 9, 2011}}</ref><ref name=zdnetearly>Borland, John.

Because of the use of COM, it is possible to embed web-browsing functionality in third-party applications. Hence, there are a number of Internet Explorer shells, and a number of content-centric applications like [[RealPlayer]] also use Internet Explorer's web browsing module for viewing web pages within the applications.\n\n==Removal==\n{{Main|Removal of Internet Explorer}}\nWhile a major upgrade of Internet Explorer can be uninstalled in a traditional way if the user has saved the original application files for installation, the matter of uninstalling the version of the browser that has shipped with an operating system remains a controversial one.\n\nThe idea of removing a stock install of Internet Explorer from a Windows system was proposed during the ''[[United States v. Microsoft Corp. (2001)|United States v. Microsoft Corp.]]'' case. One of Microsoft's arguments during the trial was that removing Internet Explorer from Windows may result in system instability. Indeed, programs that depend on libraries installed by IE, including Windows help and support system, fail to function without IE. Before Windows Vista, it was not possible to run [[Windows Update]] without IE because the service used ActiveX technology, which no other web browser supports.\n\n==Impersonation by malware==\nThe popularity of Internet Explorer has led to the appearance of malware abusing its name. On January 28, 2011, a fake Internet Explorer browser calling itself \"Internet Explorer \u2013 Emergency Mode\" appeared. It closely resembles the real Internet Explorer, but has fewer buttons and no search bar. If a user attempts to launch any other browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] or the real Internet Explorer, this browser will be loaded instead. It also displays a fake error message, claiming that the computer is infected with malware and Internet Explorer has entered \"Emergency Mode\". It blocks access to legitimate sites such as [[Google]] if the user tries to access them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.im-infected.com/hijacker/internet-explorer-emergency-mode.html |title=IE Emergency Mode |work=im-infected.com |date=January 28, 2011 |accessdate=June 23, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630065328/http://www.im-infected.com/hijacker/internet-explorer-emergency-mode.html |archivedate=June 30, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/remove-avg-antivirus-2011 |title=Bleeping Computer \u2013 Fake IE Emergency Mode (by fake AVG) |date=January 28, 2011 |accessdate=June 23, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Internet}}\n* [[Bing Bar]]\n* [[History of the web browser]]\n* [[List of web browsers]]\n* [[Month of bugs]]\n* [[Web 2.0]]\n* [[Windows Filtering Platform]]\n* [[Winsock]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite web |title=Index DOT Html and Index DOT Css |work=Browser History: Windows Internet Explorer |url=http://www.blooberry.com/indexdot/history/ie.htm |accessdate=December 22, 2013}}\n* {{cite web |title=Windows Vista & IE7 Beta 1 Available | url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2005/07/27/windows-vista-amp-ie7-beta-1-available.aspx |work=IEBlog |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=July 27, 2005 |accessdate=December 22, 2013 |first=Dean |last=Hachamovitch |authorlink=Dean Hachamovitch}}\n* {{cite web |title=Standards and CSS in IE |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2005/07/29/445242.aspx |work=IEBlog |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=July 30, 2005 |accessdate=December 22, 2013 |first=Chris |last=Wilson}}\n* {{cite web |title=IE7 Is Coming This Month |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2006/10/06/IE7-Is-Coming-This-Month_2E002E002E00_Are-you-Ready_3F00_.aspx |work=IEBlog |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=October 7, 2006 |accessdate=December 22, 2013 |first=Scott |last=Graff}}\n* {{cite web |title=IE7 Platforms And Outlook Express |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2005/02/28/382054.aspx |work=IEBlog |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=March 1, 2005 |accessdate=December 22, 2013}}\n* {{cite web |title=Gates Highlights Progress on Security, Outlines Next Steps for Continued Innovation |url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/2005/feb05/02-15rsa05keynotepr.aspx |work=News Center |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=February 15, 2005 |accessdate=December 22, 2013}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/09/16/internet-explorer-9-logo-visual-refresh.aspx |title=User Experiences: Evolving the blue \"e\" |work=IEBlog |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |first1=Mary-Lynne |last1=Williams |first2=Leslie |last2=MacNeil |first3=Marty |last3=Hall |editor-first=Dean |editor-last=Hachamovitch |editor-link=Dean Hachamovitch |date=September 17, 2010 |accessdate = December 22, 2013}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Internet Explorer}}\n{{Wikinews|France, Germany officials warn against using Internet Explorer}}\n{{Wikibooks|Internet Explorer}}\n* {{Official website}}\n** [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/platform-apis/aa741312(v=vs.85) Internet Explorer Architecture]\n\n{{Internet Explorer|state=open}}\n{{Web browsers|desktop}}\n{{gopher clients}}\n{{Aggregators}}\n{{Timeline of web browsers|1990s}}\n{{Windows Components}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Internet Explorer| ]]\n[[Category:1995 software]]\n[[Category:FTP clients]]\n[[Category:History of the Internet]]\n[[Category:News aggregator software]]\n[[Category:Proprietary software]]\n[[Category:Windows components]]\n[[Category:Windows web browsers]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 1995]]\n[[Category:Discontinued Microsoft software]]\n[[Category:Web browsers]]\n[[Category:Xbox One software]]\n[[Category:Xbox 360 software]]\n", "name_user": "WildStar", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eInternet Explorer 11:Removed update template.
