The majority of villagers were common [[peasant]]s. Paupers were buried with funeral rites, unlike slaves. In a village of 50 to 100 people, there were four or five elite couples.{{sfn|B\u00f3na|2001|p=}} In Eastern Europe, houses include sunken-floored dwellings, surface dwellings, and stall-houses. The largest known settlement is the [[Criuleni District]].{{sfn|Heather|Matthews|1991|pp=47-96}} Chernyakhov cemeteries feature both [[cremation]] and [[inhumation]] burials; among the latter the head aligned to the north.

These were ranked below the nobility, but above the [[freedmen]] and slaves.

They sowed wheat, barley, rye, and flax. They also raised pigs, poultry, and goats. Horses and donkeys were raised as working animals and fed with hay. Sheep were raised for their wool, which they fashioned into clothing. Archaeology indicates they were skilled potters and blacksmiths. When peace treaties were negotiated with the Romans, the Goths demanded free trade. Imports from Rome included wine and cooking-oil.{{sfn|B\u00f3na|2001|p=}}\n\n[[File:Bischof Ulfilas erkl\u00e4rt den Goten das Evangelium.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''[[Ulfilas]] explains the gospel to the Goths'', 1900]]\n\nRoman writers note that the Goths neither assessed [[taxes]] on their own people nor on their subjects. The early 5th century Christian writer [[Salvian]] compared the Goths' and related people's favourable treatment of the poor to the miserable state of peasants in [[Roman Gaul]]:\n<blockquote>\nFor in the Gothic country the barbarians are so far from tolerating this sort of oppression that not even Romans who live among them have to bear it. Hence all the Romans in that region have but one desire, that they may never have to return to the Roman jurisdiction.

Today, scholars identify this as a [[cultural movement]] called [[Gothicismus]], which included an enthusiasm for things [[Old Norse]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|p=23}}\n\nIn [[Spain in the Middle Ages|medieval]] and modern Spain, the Visigoths were believed to be the progenitors of the [[Spanish nobility]] (compare [[Gobineau]] for a similar French idea). By the early 7th century, the ethnic distinction between Visigoths and Hispano-Romans had all but disappeared, but recognition of a Gothic origin, e.g. on gravestones, still survived among the nobility. The 7th century Visigothic aristocracy saw itself as bearers of a particular Gothic consciousness and as guardians of old traditions such as Germanic namegiving; probably these traditions were on the whole restricted to the family sphere (Hispano-Roman nobles were doing service for Visigothic nobles already in the 5th century and the two branches of Spanish aristocracy had fully adopted similar customs two centuries later).{{sfn|Pohl|Reimitz|1998|pp=124\u2013126}}\n\nBeginning in 1278, when [[Magnus III of Sweden]] ascended to the throne, a reference to Gothic origins was included in the title of the King of Sweden: {{quote | We N.N. by the Grace of God King of the Swedes, the Goths and the Vends.}} In 1973, with the death of King [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Gustaf VI Adolf]], the title was changed to simply \"King of Sweden.\"{{sfn|Luttwak|2009|p=24}}\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote = In all history there is nothing more romantically marvellous than the swift rise of this people to the height of greatness, or than the suddenness and the tragic completeness of their ruin.{{sfn|Bradley|1888|p=3}}\n |author = \u2014 [[Henry Bradley]]\n |source = The Story of the Goths (1888)\n |align =\n |width = 18.5%\n}}\n\nThe Spanish and Swedish claims of Gothic origins led to a clash at the [[Council of Basel]] in 1434. Before the assembled [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] and delegations could engage in theological discussion, they had to decide how to sit during the proceedings. The delegations from the more prominent nations argued that they should sit closest to the [[Pope]], and there were also disputes over who were to have the finest chairs and who were to have their chairs on mats. In some cases, they compromised so that some would have half a chair leg on the rim of a mat. In this conflict, [[Nicolaus Ragvaldi]], bishop of the [[Diocese of V\u00e4xj\u00f6]], claimed that the Swedes were the descendants of the great Goths, and that the people of V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland (''Westrogothia'' in Latin) were the Visigoths and the people of \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland (''Ostrogothia'' in Latin) were the Ostrogoths. The Spanish delegation retorted that it was only the \"lazy\" and \"unenterprising\" Goths who had remained in Sweden, whereas the \"heroic\" Goths had left Sweden, invaded the Roman empire and settled in Spain.{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|p=2}}{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1896|pp=187\u2013195}}\n\nIn Spain, a man acting with arrogance would be said to be \"''haci\u00e9ndose los godos''\" (\"making himself to act like the Goths\"). In [[Chile]], [[Argentina]] and the [[Canary Islands]], ''godo'' was an [[ethnic slur]] used against European Spaniards, who in the early colonial period often felt superior to the people born locally (''[[Spanish Criollo peoples|criollos]]'').{{sfn|Bell|1993|p=67}}\n\nA large amount of literature has been produced on the Goths, with [[Henry Bradley]]'s ''The Goths'' (1888) being the standard English-language text for many decades.

Later, many moved into the Roman Empire, or settled west of the [[Carpathians]] near what is now [[Hungary]].\n\nA people called the ''Gutones''\u2014possibly early Goths\u2014are documented living near the lower [[Vistula River]] in the 1st century, where they are associated with the archaeological [[Wielbark culture]].<ref name=\"Heather_OCD\"/><ref name=\"Heather_ODLA\"/> In his book ''[[Getica]]'', the Gothic historian [[Jordanes]] claimed that the Goths originated in southern [[Scandinavia]] more than 1000 years earlier, but his reliability is disputed.<ref name=\"Heather_OCD\"/> The Wielbark culture expanded southwards towards the [[Black Sea]], where by the late 3rd century it contributed to the formation of the [[Chernyakhov culture]], which is associated with the Goths who were in frequent conflict and contact with the [[Roman Empire]].<ref name=\"Heather_OCD\"/>{{sfn|Pritsak|2005}} By the 4th century at the latest, several groups were distinguishable, among whom the [[Thervingi]] and [[Greuthungi]] were the most powerful.{{sfn|Heather|2018|p=673}} During this time, [[Ulfilas]] began the [[Gothic Christianity|conversion]] of Goths to [[Arianism]].{{sfn|Pritsak|2005}}\n\nIn the late 4th century, the lands of the Goths were invaded from the east by the [[Huns]]. In the aftermath of this event, several groups of Goths came under Hunnic domination, while others migrated further west or sought refuge inside the Roman Empire. Goths who entered the empire by crossing the [[Danube]] inflicted a devastating defeat upon the Romans at the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378. These Goths would form the [[ Visigoths]], and under their king [[Alaric I]] they began a long migration, eventually establishing a [[Visigothic Kingdom]] in Spain at [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. Meanwhile, Goths under Hunnic rule gained their independence in the 5th century, most importantly the [[Ostrogoths]]. Under their king [[Theodoric the Great]], these Goths established an [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] in Italy at [[Ravenna]].{{sfn|Heather|2012|p=623}}\n\nThe Ostrogothic Kingdom was [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|destroyed]] by the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] in the 6th century, while the Visigothic Kingdom was [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|conquered]] by the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] in the early 8th century. Remnants of Gothic communities in the [[Crimea]], known as the [[Crimean Goths]], lingered on for several centuries, although Goths would eventually cease to exist as a distinct people.{{sfn|Heather|2018|p=673}}{{sfn|Pritsak|2005}}\n\n==Name==\nThe origin and meaning of the term ''Goths'' is one of the most discussed topics in [[Germanic philology]].{{sfn|Lehmann|1986|pp=163\u2013164}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=19-24}} \n\nIn the [[Gothic language]], the Goths were called the *''[[:wiktionary:gut\u00feiuda|Gut-\u00feiuda]]'' \"Gothic people\" (attested as dative singular ''Gut-\u00feiudai'').{{sfn|Lehmann|1986|pp=163\u2013164}} Gutthiuda can also mean \"Land of the Gothic people\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=19-24}} The simplex variant of this name, *''Gutans'' (Goth), or possibly *''Gut\u00f4s'', is inferred from a presumed genitive plural form ''gutani'' in the [[Ring of Pietroassa#Inscription|Pietroassa inscription]].{{sfn|Lehmann|1986|pp=163\u2013164}}{{sfn|Brink|2002|p=688}} \n\nThe Gothic name is generally believed to have been first attested by [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] sources in the 1st century AD in the form of ''Gutones'', which was applied to a people who at that time are recorded as living near the lower [[Vistula]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=19-24}} The name ''Gutones'' is certainly recorded by [[Pliny]] in the 1st century AD, and by [[Ptolemy]] in the 2nd century AD.{{sfn|R\u00fcbekeil|2002|pp=603-604}}{{sfn|Strid|2011|p=43}} Pliny mentions that the 4th century BC traveler [[Pytheas]] reported a people called the ''Guiones'', while the early 1st century geographer [[Strabo]] mentions a people called the ''Butones'', and the late 1st century historian [[Tacitus]] mentions the ''Gotones''.{{sfn|Strid|2011|p=43}} These names mentioned by Pytheas, Strabo and Tacitus are often equated with the name ''Gutones''.{{sfn|R\u00fcbekeil|2002|pp=603-604}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=37-41}} ''Gutones'' may have meant \"young\" Goths or \"great\" Goths.{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=19-24}} Ptolemy mentions not only the ''Gutones'', but also a people of [[Scandia]] called ''Goutai/Guti'', who are generally equated with the [[Geats]]/Gauts ({{lang-ang|g\u0113atas}};

As late as the 18th century a small number of people in Crimea may still have spoken [[Crimean Gothic]].{{sfn|Bennett|1965|p=27}}\n\n==Physical appearance==\nIn ancient sources, the Goths are always described as tall and athletic, with [[light skin]], [[blonde]] hair and [[blue eyes]].<ref name=\"Bradley_9\">{{harvnb|Bradley|1888|p=9}} \"The Goths are always described as tall and athletic men, with fair complexions, blue eyes, and yellow hair...\"</ref>{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|p=6}} Their physical size became a source of contempt among the Romans.{{sfn|Moorhead|Stuttard|2006|p=56}} Procopius notes that the Vandals and Gepids looked similar to the Goths, and on this basis, he suggested that they were all of common origin. Of the Goths, he wrote that \"they all have white bodies and fair hair, and are tall and handsome to look upon.\"<ref name=\"Procopius_III.II\"/>\n\n==Genetics==\nA genetic study published in Scientific Reports in 2018 examined the mtDNA of 60 individuals buried at the Wielbark cemetery of Kowalewko in the 1st and 2nd centuries. The majority of the individuals carried types of haplogroup H and U, and notably displayed higher frequencies of [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)#Haplogroup U5|U5b]] (a typically [[Western Hunter-Gatherer]] lineage) than preceding and succeeding populations in the area. They were found to be most closely related to Iron Age Scandinavian populations and the [[Bell Beaker culture]]. Strong genetic similarities with modern [[Scandinavians]], such as [[Norwegians]] and [[Swedes]], were detected. The males and females of Kowalewko were found to be of significantly different origins, with males displaying closer links to Iron Age Scandinavia and carrying higher amounts of [[steppe ancestry]] and hunter-gatherer ancestry than the females.{{sfn|Stolarek|2018}}\n\nA genetic study published in Scientific Reports in 2019 examined the mtDNA of 27 Goths buried at a Wielbark cemetery in [[Mas\u0142om\u0119cz]] from the 2nd to the 4th centuries. They were found to be mostly carriers of haplogroup H and U. The individuals displayed even closer genetic links to Iron Age Scandinavian populations than did those of Kowalewko. Males and females at Mas\u0142om\u0119cz were found to be more closely related to each other than those at Kowalewko. They also carried fewer samples of U5b, and displayed fewer strong genetic links to the steppe populations than earlier Wielbark samples from Kowalewko. The results appeared to support the theory that the Goths originated in southern Scandinavia and expanded southwards through the Wielbark culture towards the [[Black Sea]], where they mixed with local populations and established the Chernyakhov culture.{{sfn|Stolarek|2019}}\n\nA genetic study published in ''Scientific Reports'' in 2019 examined the mtDNA of three Gothic females from the Chernyakhov culture. They carried haplogroup [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)#H1|H1n6]], H1c and [[Haplogroup T (mtDNA)|T2g1]] respectively. The genetic makeup of these individuals differed significantly from that of previous populations of the area, being distinguished by showing a higher amount of ancestry from western and northern Europe. The results appeared to confirm the theory that the Chernyakhov culture emerged as a result of a Gothic migration from the north.{{sfn|J\u00e4rve|2019}}\n\n==Culture==\n===Art===\n{{See also|Migration Period art|Pietroasele Treasure|Ring of Pietroassa}}\n[[File:Ostgoten-fibel.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|An Ostrogothic eagle-shaped [[fibula (brooch)|fibula]], AD 500, Germanisches Nationalmuseum Nuremberg]]\nBefore the invasion of the Huns, the Gothic Chernyakhov culture produced jewelry, vessels, and decorative objects in a style much influenced by Greek and Roman craftsmen.

All other [[East Germanic languages]] are known, if at all, from proper names or [[De conviviis barbaris|short phrases]] that survived in historical accounts, and from loan-words in other languages. Gothic is known primarily from the [[Codex Argenteus]], a translation of the Bible.{{sfn|Pronk-Tiethoff|2013|pp=9-11}} The language was in decline by the mid-500s, due to the military victory of the Franks, the elimination of the Goths in Italy, and geographic isolation.

The majority of villagers were common [[peasant]]s. Paupers were buried with funeral rites, unlike slaves. In a village of 50 to 100 people, there were four or five elite couples.{{sfn|B\u00f3na|2001|p=}} In Eastern Europe, houses include sunken-floored dwellings, surface dwellings, and stall-houses.

These were ranked below the nobility, but above the [[freedmen]] and slaves.

They sowed wheat, barley, rye, and flax. They also raised pigs, poultry, and goats. Horses and donkeys were raised as working animals and fed with hay. Sheep were raised for their wool, which they fashioned into clothing. Archaeology indicates they were skilled potters and blacksmiths. When peace treaties were negotiated with the Romans, the Goths demanded free trade. Imports from Rome included wine and cooking-oil.{{sfn|B\u00f3na|2001|p=}}\n\n[[File:Bischof Ulfilas erkl\u00e4rt den Goten das Evangelium.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''[[Ulfilas]] explains the gospel to the Goths'', 1900]]\n\nRoman writers note that the Goths neither assessed [[taxes]] on their own people nor on their subjects. The early 5th century Christian writer [[Salvian]] compared the Goths' and related people's favourable treatment of the poor to the miserable state of peasants in [[Roman Gaul]]:\n<blockquote>\nFor in the Gothic country the barbarians are so far from tolerating this sort of oppression that not even Romans who live among them have to bear it. Hence all the Romans in that region have but one desire, that they may never have to return to the Roman jurisdiction.

By the early 7th century, the ethnic distinction between Visigoths and Hispano-Romans had all but disappeared, but recognition of a Gothic origin, e.g. on gravestones, still survived among the nobility. The 7th century Visigothic aristocracy saw itself as bearers of a particular Gothic consciousness and as guardians of old traditions such as Germanic namegiving; probably these traditions were on the whole restricted to the family sphere (Hispano-Roman nobles were doing service for Visigothic nobles already in the 5th century and the two branches of Spanish aristocracy had fully adopted similar customs two centuries later).{{sfn|Pohl|Reimitz|1998|pp=124\u2013126}}\n\nBeginning in 1278, when [[Magnus III of Sweden]] ascended to the throne, a reference to Gothic origins was included in the title of the King of Sweden: {{quote | We N.N. by the Grace of God King of the Swedes, the Goths and the Vends.}} In 1973, with the death of King [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Gustaf VI Adolf]], the title was changed to simply \"King of Sweden.\"{{sfn|Luttwak|2009|p=24}}\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote = In all history there is nothing more romantically marvellous than the swift rise of this people to the height of greatness, or than the suddenness and the tragic completeness of their ruin.{{sfn|Bradley|1888|p=3}}\n |author = \u2014 [[Henry Bradley]]\n |source = The Story of the Goths (1888)\n |align =\n |width = 18.5%\n}}\n\nThe Spanish and Swedish claims of Gothic origins led to a clash at the [[Council of Basel]] in 1434. Before the assembled [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] and delegations could engage in theological discussion, they had to decide how to sit during the proceedings. The delegations from the more prominent nations argued that they should sit closest to the [[Pope]], and there were also disputes over who were to have the finest chairs and who were to have their chairs on mats. In some cases, they compromised so that some would have half a chair leg on the rim of a mat. In this conflict, [[Nicolaus Ragvaldi]], bishop of the [[Diocese of V\u00e4xj\u00f6]], claimed that the Swedes were the descendants of the great Goths, and that the people of V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland (''Westrogothia'' in Latin) were the Visigoths and the people of \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland (''Ostrogothia'' in Latin) were the Ostrogoths. The Spanish delegation retorted that it was only the \"lazy\" and \"unenterprising\" Goths who had remained in Sweden, whereas the \"heroic\" Goths had left Sweden, invaded the Roman empire and settled in Spain.{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|p=2}}{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1896|pp=187\u2013195}}\n\nIn Spain, a man acting with arrogance would be said to be \"''haci\u00e9ndose los godos''\" (\"making himself to act like the Goths\").

It acts in a similar manner to [[SVG]] files. WMF files were later superseded by '''Enhanced Metafiles''' (EMF files) which did provide for device-independence. EMF files were then themselves enhanced via '''EMF+''' files.\n\nEssentially, a metafile stores a list of records consisting of drawing commands, property definitions and graphics objects to display an image on screen.<ref name=\"wmfspecdef\">{{citation|url= https://winprotocoldoc.blob.core.windows.net/productionwindowsarchives/MS-WMF/%5bMS-WMF%5d.pdf|title=Windows Metafile Format|publisher=Microsoft|p=16}}</ref> There are three major types of metafiles - a WMF is a [[16-bit]] format introduced in [[Windows 3.0]].

These manuals were published as printed books available in bookstores with no [[clickwrap|click through]] [[End-user license agreement|EULA]] or other unusual licensing restrictions (just a general warning that if purchased as part of a software bundle, the software would be subject to one).\n\nOver time the existence of that historic specification was largely forgotten and some alternative implementations resorted to reverse engineering to figure out the file format from existing WMF files, which was difficult and error prone.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://wvware.sourceforge.net/caolan/support.html | title=Window Metafile (wmf) Reference | quote=''These opcodes are unimplemented, for the reason that i dont know what they are, no known documentation'' | author=Caolan McNamara | accessdate=2008-06-01}}</ref> In September 2006, Microsoft again published the WMF file format specification in a more complete form<ref>{{cite web | url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc215212.aspx | title=<nowiki>[MS-WMF]:</nowiki> Windows Metafile Format Specification | accessdate=2008-06-01 }}</ref> in the context of the [[Microsoft Open Specification Promise]], promising to not assert patent rights to file format implementors.<ref name=\"osp\">{{cite web | url=http://www.microsoft.com/interop/osp/ | title=Microsoft Open Specification Promise | accessdate=2008-06-01 }}</ref>\n\nMicrosoft later deprecated WMF files in favour of 32-bit EMF files as WMF files had real issues with device independence, despite the use of a \"placeable\" file header which provided basic device independence.

Some records define objects which can specify graphical objects used to determine how graphics should be drawn (e.g. pens specify the color and width of lines). Each of these objects are stored in metafiles and are placed into an object table, which tracks the usage of graphic objects while processing the metafile. The object table is an [[associative array]] of indexes to graphical object structures defined within the metafile. \n\nWMF and EMF files handle object processing differently to EMF+ records in EMF files. As a WMF and EMF file is being processed, the records are read into an object table once an object is defined. If an object is deleted then the object is released from the table and the identifier can be reused. Notably an object will not be used until it is specifically selected during record playback.<ref>{{citation|url= https://winprotocoldoc.blob.core.windows.net/productionwindowsarchives/MS-WMF/%5bMS-WMF%5d.pdf|title=<nowiki>[MS-WMF]:</nowiki> Enhanced Metafile Format|publisher=Microsoft|p=187|section=3.1.4.1 WMF Object Table}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url= https://winprotocoldoc.blob.core.windows.net/productionwindowsarchives/MS-EMF/%5bMS-EMF%5d.pdf|title=<nowiki>[MS-EMF]:</nowiki> Windows Metafile Format Specification|publisher=Microsoft|p=212-214|section=3.1.1.1 EMF Object Table}}</ref> This differs for EMF+ files, which also use an associative array via a [[hashmap]] which records the object along with an object identifier. However, unlike WMF and EMF files which can delete an object, when a new object is created that has the same index as an existing object, the entry in the table is replaced with the new object. An EMF file also does not need to specifically select an object before it is used.<ref>{{citation|url=https://winprotocoldoc.blob.core.windows.net/productionwindowsarchives/MS-EMFPLUS/%5bMS-EMFPLUS%5d.pdf|pp=204-205|title=<nowiki>[MS-EMFPLUS]:</nowiki> Enhanced Metafile Format Plus Extensions|publisher=Microsoft}}</ref>\n\n===WMF===\n[[File:WMF-structure.svg|thumb|left|Structures of original and placeable Windows metafiles<ref>{{citation|url= https://winprotocoldoc.blob.core.windows.net/productionwindowsarchives/MS-WMF/%5bMS-WMF%5d.pdf|title=Windows Metafile Format|publisher=Microsoft|p=17|section=Figure 1: Structures of original and placeable Windows metafiles}}</ref>]]\n\nWMF files were not originally designed to be device independent, meaning that you could not playback the file on output devices that differed from the original device on which the file was recorded.

This affected Windows systems (see {{CVE|2005-4560}}) and the [[Wine (software)|Wine project]] (see {{CVE|2006-0106}}). According to [[Secunia]], \"The vulnerability is caused due to an error in the handling of Windows Metafile files ('.wmf') containing specially crafted SETABORTPROC 'Escape' records.

In the Windows 3.1 \u201clarge\u201d memory model code is inherently location-independent and Windows was never patched, so both Windows and an application could simply copy an application function into the WMF file and assume it would work when played back by the same application in a later run session. In any case, its not clear that the developers envisioned applications creating on-disk metafiles with abort procedures. Also, as Microsoft\u2019s Stephen Toulouse pointed out in [https://web.archive.org/web/20060116042756/http://blogs.technet.com/msrc/archive/2006/01/13/417431.aspx Microsoft\u2019s rebuttal] to Steve\u2019s claims, the security landscape in the early 1990s was very different than today and all code, including that stored in a WMF file, was inherently trusted.<ref>{{citation|url=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-blog-archive/inside-the-wmf-backdoor/ba-p/723489|first=Mark|last=Russinovich|author-link=Mark Russinovich|title=Inside the WMF Backdoor|publisher=Microsoft|work=TechNet|via=Microsoft Tech Community|date=January 18, 2006}}</ref>}}\n\nPeter Ferrie of Symantec Security Response, USA also disagreed with Gibson, noting that:\n\n{{quote|Gibson claimed that a thread is created to run the SetAbortProc handler. In fact, no thread is created to run the handler \u2013 it is a callback, which is called by the parser, and the parser has to wait until the callback returns, otherwise the whole point of the function (to abort the printing) is lost. By his own admission, Gibson did not read the documentation (in fact, he claimed that he couldn\u2019t find it, although it is freely available on Microsoft\u2019s Web site), and he claimed that the device context is not available to the function handler. Of course the device context is available to the function handler &mdash; it is one of the two parameters that is passed to it (see above), and it is required in order to abort the printing. Finally, Gibson claimed that the control flow could not return to Windows. It is simply a matter of the function returning and discarding the parameters that were passed on the stack. If the record is well formed, Windows will continue to parse the file, as before. ... Gibson admits that he was guessing about a number of things. Unfortunately, he guessed poorly.

Some records define objects which can specify graphical objects used to determine how graphics should be drawn (e.g. pens specify the color and width of lines). Each of these objects are stored in metafiles and are placed into an object table, which tracks the usage of graphic objects while processing the metafile. The object table is an [[associative array]] of indexes to graphical object structures defined within the metafile. \n\nWMF and EMF files handle object processing differently to EMF+ records in EMF files. As a WMF and EMF file is being processed, the records are read into an object table once an object is defined. If an object is deleted then the object is released from the table and the identifier can be reused. Notably an object will not be used until it is specifically selected during record playback.<ref>{{citation|url= https://winprotocoldoc.blob.core.windows.net/productionwindowsarchives/MS-WMF/%5bMS-WMF%5d.pdf|title=<nowiki>[MS-WMF]:</nowiki> Enhanced Metafile Format|publisher=Microsoft|p=187|section=3.1.4.1 WMF Object Table}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url= https://winprotocoldoc.blob.core.windows.net/productionwindowsarchives/MS-EMF/%5bMS-EMF%5d.pdf|title=<nowiki>[MS-EMF]:</nowiki> Windows Metafile Format Specification|publisher=Microsoft|p=212-214|section=3.1.1.1 EMF Object Table}}</ref> This differs for EMF+ files, which also use an associative array via a [[hashmap]] which records the object along with an object identifier. However, unlike WMF and EMF files which can delete an object, when a new object is created that has the same index as an existing object, the entry in the table is replaced with the new object. An EMF file also does not need to specifically select an object before it is used.<ref>{{citation|url=https://winprotocoldoc.blob.core.windows.net/productionwindowsarchives/MS-EMFPLUS/%5bMS-EMFPLUS%5d.pdf|pp=204-205|title=<nowiki>[MS-EMFPLUS]:</nowiki> Enhanced Metafile Format Plus Extensions|publisher=Microsoft}}</ref>\n\n===WMF===\n[[File:WMF-structure.svg|thumb|left|Structures of original and placeable Windows metafiles<ref>{{citation|url= https://winprotocoldoc.blob.core.windows.net/productionwindowsarchives/MS-WMF/%5bMS-WMF%5d.pdf|title=Windows Metafile Format|publisher=Microsoft|p=17|section=Figure 1: Structures of original and placeable Windows metafiles}}</ref>]]\n\nWMF files were not originally designed to be device independent, meaning that you could not playback the file on output devices that differed from the original device on which the file was recorded.

This affected Windows systems (see {{CVE|2005-4560}}) and the [[Wine (software)|Wine project]] (see {{CVE|2006-0106}}). According to [[Secunia]], \"The vulnerability is caused due to an error in the handling of Windows Metafile files ('.wmf') containing specially crafted SETABORTPROC 'Escape' records. Such records allow arbitrary user-defined function to be executed when the rendering of a WMF file fails.\"<ref name=secunia>{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060102123654/http://secunia.com/advisories/18255/|archive-date=January 2, 2008|url=http://secunia.com/advisories/18255/|title=Microsoft Windows WMF \"SETABORTPROC\" Arbitrary Code Execution|id=Secunia Advisory: SA18255|publisher=[[Secunia]]}}</ref> According to the Windows 3.1 SDK documentation, the SETABORTPROC escape was obsoleted and replaced by the function of the same name in Windows 3.1, long before the WMF vulnerability was discovered.<ref>{{citation|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/print/pscript-supported-escapes|title=Pscript-Supported Escapes|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=2020-01-28}}</ref> However the obsoleted escape code was retained for compatibility with 16 bit programs written for (or at least backwards compatible with) Windows 3.0. This change happened at approximately the same time as Microsoft was creating the 32 bit reimplementation of GDI for Windows NT, and it is likely that the vulnerability occurred during this effort. \n\nAfter [[Steve Gibson (computer programmer)|Steve Gibson]] from [[Gibson Research Corporation]] accused Microsoft of deliberately implementing a [[backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] into their code,<ref>{{cite podcast|url=https://media.grc.com/sn/sn-022.mp3|title=The Windows MetaFile Backdoor?|website=GRC Security Now!|publisher=[[Gibson Research Corporation]]|date=January 12, 2006|access-date=2020-01-28}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title = Re: You won't want to miss tonight's Security Now!, #22|first=Steve|last=Gibson|author-link=Steve Gibson (computer programmer)|date=January 12, 2006|work=grc.news.feedback|url=https://www.grc.com/x/news.exe?cmd=article&group=grc.news.feedback&item=60006|access-date=2020-01-28}}</ref> [[Mark Russinovich]] provided a rebuttal, and stated that:\n\n{{quote|...things were different when the format was architected. In the Windows 3.1 \u201clarge\u201d memory model code is inherently location-independent and Windows was never patched, so both Windows and an application could simply copy an application function into the WMF file and assume it would work when played back by the same application in a later run session. In any case, its not clear that the developers envisioned applications creating on-disk metafiles with abort procedures. Also, as Microsoft\u2019s Stephen Toulouse pointed out in [https://web.archive.org/web/20060116042756/http://blogs.technet.com/msrc/archive/2006/01/13/417431.aspx Microsoft\u2019s rebuttal] to Steve\u2019s claims, the security landscape in the early 1990\u2019s was very different than today and all code, including that stored in a WMF file, was inherently trusted.<ref>{{citation|url=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-blog-archive/inside-the-wmf-backdoor/ba-p/723489|first=Mark|last=Russinovich|author-link=Mark Russinovich|title=Inside the WMF Backdoor|publisher=Microsoft|work=TechNet|via=Microsoft Tech Community|date=January 18, 2006}}</ref>}}\n\nPeter Ferrie of Symantec Security Response, USA also disagreed with Gibson, noting that:\n\n{{quote|Gibson claimed that a thread is created to run the SetAbortProc handler. In fact, no thread is created to run the handler \u2013 it is a callback, which is called by the parser, and the parser has to wait until the callback returns, otherwise the whole point of the function (to abort the printing) is lost. By his own admission, Gibson did not read the documentation (in fact, he claimed that he couldn\u2019t find it, although it is freely available on Microsoft\u2019s Web site), and he claimed that the device context is not available to the function handler. Of course the device context is available to the function handler &mdash; it is one of the two parameters that is passed to it (see above), and it is required in order to abort the printing. Finally, Gibson claimed that the control flow could not return to Windows. It is simply a matter of the function returning and discarding the parameters that were passed on the stack. If the record is well formed, Windows will continue to parse the file, as before. ... Gibson admits that he was guessing about a number of things. Unfortunately, he guessed poorly.

[[Rivalry (sports)|rivalry]] between the [[Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball]] team of [[Gonzaga University]] in [[Spokane, Washington]] and the [[Washington Huskies men's basketball|Washington Huskies]] team of [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle, Washington]].\n\n== Series Overview ==\nGonzaga and Washington have met a total of 48 times dating back to 1910 and have met annually since 2015. The Huskies dominated the series up until the end of the 20th century, but Gonzaga has won 13 of the last 14 meetings, dating back to 1998. The Huskies hold a 18\u20137 lead in Seattle, the series is tied 11\u201311 in Spokane, and the Zags own a 1\u20130 record in neutral locations, but they have never met in any postseason tournaments.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/play-index/matchup_finder.cgi?request=1&school_id=gonzaga&opp_id=washington&comp_school=le&rank_school=ANY&comp_opp=le&rank_opp=ANY&game_type=A&game_month=&game_location=&game_result=&is_overtime=&order_by=date_game|title=Matchup Finder {{!}} College Basketball at Sports-Reference.com|website=College Basketball at Sports-Reference.com|language=en|accessdate=February 10, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{cite news|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/sidearm.sites/washington.sidearmsports.com/documents/2018/10/16/18_19_Record_Book.pdf |title=2018-19 Huskies Basketball Record Book|date=October 16, 2018}}</ref> \n\n== Hiatus ==\nWashington and Gonzaga met 11 times between 1995 and 2006, including a true home-and-home series annually from 1997 until 2006, but then Washington cancelled the series. Gonzaga was dominating the series, ascending from a Cinderalla in the 1999 NCAA Tournament to regular in the top 25 polls and the NCAA Tournament every year. Bad blood surfaced between the schools with Huskies assistant coach [[Cameron Dollar]] breaking NCAA rules while recruiting [[Josh Heytvelt]], who ended up signing with the Zags.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sportspressnw.com/2115611/2010/truth-behind-the-feud-between-zags-huskies-2|title=Truth behind the feud between Zags, Huskies|date=December 3, 2010}}</ref> In 2009, [[Lorenzo Romar]] and his Washington staff proposed a series three games in a row at KeyArena in Seattle, but Gonzaga head coach [[Mark Few]] took insult to that, retorting with \"the chances of that happening are about the same as Bigfoot having my baby.
