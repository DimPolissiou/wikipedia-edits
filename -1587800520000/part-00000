{"title_page": "Musgrave family", "text_new": "{{cleanup reorganize|article's use of bullet points for the biographies of later Musgraves, rather than standard sentence/paragraph structure,|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe '''Musgrave family'''  was a prominent [[Anglo-Scottish Border]] family with many descendants in the [[United States of America]], [[Australia]] and the [[United Kingdom]] a so-called Riding or [[Border Reivers|Reiver]] clan of [[Cumberland]] and [[Westmorland]].  The earliest record of the Musgraves is Gamel, Lord of Musgrave, noted as being \"of the county of Westmorland and divers manors in county Cumberland, living in the time of King Edward the Confessor (1042-1065) predating the Norman Conquest.\"\nThe Musgraves though often Wardens of the West March during the times of the Reivers and among the fourteen most notorious of the reiving clans were known locally as de\u2019ils (devils) dozen and consisted of the following families: Armstrong, Bell, Carleton, Dacre, Elliot, Graham, Johnstone, Kerr, Maxwell, Musgrave, Nixon, [[Routledge (surname)|Routledge]], Scott and Storey.\n\nWhether the family origin is [[Anglo-Saxon]], [[Normans|Norman]], or [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]] [[Britons (Celtic people)|Briton]] is unclear. The family name may be derived from several etymological possibilities.  The name is presumed to have been derived from Musgrave, Mewsgrave, or Musgreave: \"the keeper of the king's hawks, or the king's equerry.\"{{cn|date=March 2020}} Another possibility is the Anglo Saxon ''mus'' for \"mouse\" and ''grav'' for \"mossy plain\".  The historian [[William Camden]] said that they gained their name from the village of [[Great Musgrave]], where they settled, but [[Arthur Collins (antiquarian)|Arthur Collins]] suggested that the name was a variation of the title [[margrave]], meaning march-warden.<ref>{{citation |pages=74\u201385 |author=Arthur Collins |publisher=Thomas Wotton |year=1741 |title=The English Baronetage}}</ref>\n\nThe Coat of Arms granted to Sir Thomas Musgrave in the reign of Edward III (1327 - 1377) depicts six gold annulets, three, two and one, on a red shield.

The historian [[William Camden]] said that they gained their name from the village of [[Great Musgrave]], where they settled, but [[Arthur Collins (antiquarian)|Arthur Collins]] suggested that the name was a variation of the title [[margrave]], meaning march-warden.<ref>{{citation |pages=74\u201385 |author=Arthur Collins |publisher=Thomas Wotton |year=1741 |title=The English Baronetage}}</ref>\n\nThe Coat of Arms granted to Sir Thomas Musgrave in the reign of Edward III (1327 - 1377) depicts six gold annulets, three, two and one, on a red shield.

He appears for the first time in \"Part II\" of the manga and the ''Shippuden'' anime adaptation, as a background character. He, along with its first leader [[Hashirama Senju]], is one of the co-founders of {{nihongo4|Konohagakure|\u6728\u30ce\u8449\u96a0\u308c\u306e\u91cc|Konohagakure no Sato|lead=yes}} village from the ninja world . Their power conflict over how to run the village, as well as the long-term feud between clans, leads to Madara's death. However, it is revealed later that Madara had used a man named [[Obito Uchiha]] as his agent. He transplants his Eye Technique {{nihongo|Rinnegan|\u8f2a\u5efb\u773c||lit. \"[[Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra]] Eye\"}} eye power into a child named [[Nagato (Naruto)|Nagato]], the leader of the terrorist organization [[List of Naruto characters#Akatsuki|Akatsuki]], to be preserved for his eventual revival years later. During most of the series, Obito uses Madara's name until a criminal named [[Kabuto Yakushi]] reanimates the real Madara who becomes the main antagonist during the Fourth Shinobi World War storyline. Madara has appeared in several pieces of ''Naruto'' media, including a ''Boruto'' feature film. Many  [[List of Naruto video games|''Naruto'' video games]] have featured him as a [[playable character]].\n\nKishimoto created the character to provide a strong villain in the series' final arc who would face the series' protagonist, [[Naruto Uzumaki]]. This confrontation would be different from that with previous enemies and result in more of a focus on fight scenes. Merchandise has been released in Madara's likeness, including keychains, [[plush doll]]s, and figurines. In the Japanese anime, [[Naoya Uchida]] voices Madara, while Go Inoue voices him as a child. In the English version, [[Neil Kaplan]] provides Madara's voice with [[Xander Mobus]] voicing him as a child. Critics have commented on his role as an antagonist in the series; some have placed him on top all-time anime villains lists, while others have criticized his effectiveness. Nevertheless, Madara's background was well-received for how integral his story is to the series' scenario.\n\n==Creation and design==\nMadara originated from [[Masashi Kishimoto]]'s desire to elaborate on the ending to the [[manga]] series ''[[Naruto]]''. Once the series began its second part, simply referred to as \"Part II\" in the manga and ''Shippuden'' in the [[anime]], Kishimoto felt the need to create a story arc that would emphasize the tragedy of wars, leading to the final arc which would include a war. According to Kishimoto, Naruto and his group were weak as children in the first part and he wanted to make them stronger in the second part. This is the reason he introduced the Akatsuki and in turn Madara as their enemies.<ref name=\"Madara002\">{{Cite AV media |title=\u6f2b\u9053\u30b3\u30d0\u30e4\u30b7\u7b2c13\u53f7\u300cNARUTO\u5b8c\u7d50\uff01\u5cb8\u672c\u6589\u53f2SP\u300d |date=December 13, 2014 |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Fuji Television]] |trans-title=Kobayashi No. 13 'Completion of Naruto!

He appears for the first time in \"Part II\" of the manga and the ''Shippuden'' anime adaptation, as a background character. He, along with its first leader [[Hashirama Senju]], is one of the co-founders of {{nihongo4|Konohagakure|\u6728\u30ce\u8449\u96a0\u308c\u306e\u91cc|Konohagakure no Sato|lead=yes}} village from the ninja world . Their power conflict over how to run the village, as well as the long-term feud between clans, leads to Madara's death. However, it is revealed later that Madara had used a man named [[Obito Uchiha]] as his agent. He transplants his Eye Technique {{nihongo|Rinnegan|\u8f2a\u5efb\u773c||lit. \"[[Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra]] Eye\"}} eye power into a child named [[Nagato (Naruto)|Nagato]], the leader of the terrorist organization [[List of Naruto characters#Akatsuki|Akatsuki]], to be preserved for his eventual revival years later. During most of the series, Obito uses Madara's name until a criminal named [[Kabuto Yakushi]] reanimates the real Madara who becomes the main antagonist during the Fourth Shinobi World War storyline. Madara has appeared in several pieces of ''Naruto'' media, including a ''Boruto'' feature film. Many  [[List of Naruto video games|''Naruto'' video games]] have featured him as a [[playable character]].\n\nKishimoto created the character to provide a strong villain in the series' final arc who would face the series' protagonist, [[Naruto Uzumaki]]. This confrontation would be different from that with previous enemies and result in more of a focus on fight scenes. Merchandise has been released in Madara's likeness, including keychains, [[plush doll]]s, and figurines. In the Japanese anime, [[Naoya Uchida]] voices Madara, while Go Inoue voices him as a child. In the English version, [[Neil Kaplan]] provides Madara's voice with [[Xander Mobus]] voicing him as a child. Critics have commented on his role as an antagonist in the series; some have placed him on top all-time anime villains lists, while others have criticized his effectiveness. Nevertheless, Madara's background was well-received for how integral his story is to the series' scenario.\n\n==Creation and design==\nMadara originated from [[Masashi Kishimoto]]'s desire to elaborate on the ending to the [[manga]] series ''[[Naruto]]''. Once the series began its second part, simply referred to as \"Part II\" in the manga and ''Shippuden'' in the [[anime]], Kishimoto felt the need to create a story arc that would emphasize the tragedy of wars, leading to the final arc which would include a war. According to Kishimoto, Naruto and his group were weak as children in the first part and he wanted to make them stronger in the second part. This is the reason he introduced the Akatsuki and in turn Madara as their enemies.<ref name=\"Madara002\">{{Cite AV media |title=\u6f2b\u9053\u30b3\u30d0\u30e4\u30b7\u7b2c13\u53f7\u300cNARUTO\u5b8c\u7d50\uff01\u5cb8\u672c\u6589\u53f2SP\u300d |date=December 13, 2014 |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Fuji Television]] |trans-title=Kobayashi No. 13 'Completion of Naruto!

One of Ushakov's main tasks was to take the strategically important Ionian Islands from the French. In October 1798 the French garrisons were driven from [[Cythera (island)|Cythera]], [[Zakynthos]], [[Cephalonia]], and [[Lefkada]]. It remained to take the largest and best-fortified island of the archipelago, Corfu.\n\n===The garrison of the island===\n[[File:Kontrafossa in Corfu.PNG|thumb|alt=Kontrafossa in Corfu|The moat of Palaio Frourio]]\nThe [[Corfu (city)|city of Corfu]] is located on the east coast in the central part of the island between two forts:\n* The medieval [[Old Fortress, Corfu|Old Fortress]], on the eastern tip of the city, cut off from the city by an artificial moat;\n* The more modern [[New Fortress, Corfu|New Fortress]], a huge complex of fortifications dominating the northeastern part of the city.\n\nFrom the new to the old fort a high wall ran along the shore. The town was also covered by bastions on two mountains, Abraham and Salvatore, and the intermediate fort of San Rocco. From the sea, the city was protected by the well-fortified island of [[Vido]], and the smaller island of [[Lazaretto Island (Corfu)|Lazaretto]], two miles up the coast, was also strengthened by the French.\n\n[[File:Neo Frourio in Corfu.jpg|thumb|alt=The new citadel (Neo Frourio)|The New Fortress]]\nThe French, commanded by the governor General [[Louis Fran\u00e7ois Jean Chabot|Louis Chabot]], had 3000 soldiers and 650 guns in Corfu, plus 500 soldiers and 5 artillery batteries on the island of Vido. In the harbour was a French squadron of two ships of the line, the 74-gun [[French ship G\u00e9n\u00e9reux (1785)|''G\u00e9n\u00e9reux'']] and 54-gun [[HMS Leander (1780)|''Leander'']], the 20-gun corvette [[French corvette Brune (1781)|''Brune'']], a bomb-vessel, a brig and four auxiliary vessels.\n\n==The siege of Corfu==\nOn 4 November 1798 Ushakov's Russian-Turkish squadron, consisting of three [[ships of the line]], three frigates and a number of small ships, began the siege of Corfu. They were joined shortly afterwards by a [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] squadron and another Russian squadron under the command of Captain [[Dmitry Senyavin]]. Given the strong fortifications of the island and the lack of strength for a landing, it was initially decided to wait for Turkish reinforcements for a landing force. However, on the first day the French abandoned their fortifications on Lazaretto island, which the Russians immediately occupied.\n\nOn 13 November a small force of Russians landed without opposition and took the small port of Gouvia about five miles along the coast. From then on the Russians began building batteries and shelling the French-held forts. In December, another Russian squadron, this one under Rear-Admiral Pavel Pustoshkinthe, augmented the besieging forces. The combined fleet now consisted of 12 ships of the line, 11 frigates and many smaller vessels.\n\nOn the night of January 26 the ''G\u00e9n\u00e9reux'', with her sails painted black, and the brig escaped from the harbour and sailed to Ancona.\n\nIn February, about 4,000 Ottoman troops arrived and it was decided to make a landing on the island of Vido \u2013 the key to the defense of Corfu \u2013 using naval artillery against its shore batteries.\n\n===Capture of Vido===\n[[Image:Vido-on-Vidovdan-pano.jpg|thumb|250px|Vido island]]\nThe assault on Vido began early in the morning of 28 February 1799. After a four-hour bombardment by several ships, all five shore batteries on the island had been suppressed. The ''Leander'' and ''Brune'' tried to intervene but were damaged and forced to retreat to the protection of the batteries of Corfu. The allied fleet then landed over 2000 men on Vido and after a two-hour battle the island was taken. Of the 800 men defending the island, 200 were killed and 400 were taken prisoner, including the commandant of the island, Brigadier-General Pivron. About 150 men managed to swim to Corfu. Russian losses were 31 killed and 100 wounded. The Ottomans lost 180 killed and wounded.\n\n===Capture of Corfu city===\nAfter the fall of Vido, the key to Corfu was in the hands of Ushakov. On March 1 the captured batteries on the island opened fire on the city's forts, supported by the Russians' shore batteries and some of the Russian and Turkish warships. The allied forces stormed and captured the outlying forts of San Rocco, San Salvatore and San Abraham.\n\nOn 2 March Ushakov planned to assault the main forts, but in the morning the French sent envoys to request a forty-eight-hour armistice, and on 3 March they surrendered.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe capitulation agreed between the French and Russians was an honourable one, including a provision for the French troops to be conveyed to Toulon. The remaining French ships in the harbour were taken by the allies, including the ''Leander'' which had been captured from the Royal Navy on [[Action of 18 August 1798|18 August 1798]]; the Russians returned her to the British.\n\nAdmiral [[Fyodor Ushakov|Ushakov]] was honoured by the [[Paul I of Russia|Emperor of Russia]] with the star of the [[Order of St. Alexander Nevsky|Order of St Alexander Nevsky]] and by the [[Selim III|Ottoman Sultan]] with a [[chelengk]], rarely awarded to non-Muslims.\n\nThe capture of Corfu completed the Russo-Turkish takeover of the Ionian Islands, which was of great military and political importance. The islands became the [[Seven Islands Republic]], a temporary protectorate of Russia and Turkey, and for several years Corfu served as a base for the Russian Mediterranean fleet. Ushakov's fleet went on to support the allied attack on [[Parthenopean Republic|Naples]].\n\n==Popular culture==\nIn 1953, director [[Mikhail Romm]] made a cinematographic dramatization of the Russian conquest of the Ionian Islands called ''[[Attack from the Sea|\u041a\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043b\u0438 \u0448\u0442\u0443\u0440\u043c\u0443\u044e\u0442 \u0431\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043e\u043d\u044b]]'' (The Ships Storm the Bastions), the second of a two-part biographical epic about admiral Ushakov.

The Founder-[[Vice-Chancellor]] was [[Professor]] [[N.R. Madhava Menon]], a former Professor of law of Delhi University and Founder-Director, [[National Law School of India University]] (NLSIU), Bangalore, who is credited with revolutionising the field of legal education in India, by starting the concept of \"national law schools\", as opposed to the traditional law colleges prevalent before.\n\nThe NUJS, Kolkata, along with the NLSIU, Bengaluru, remain the only two national law schools which have the honourable Chief Justice of India as the Chancellor. This set-up provides an aura of exclusivity and rare stature to these National Law Schools in India. It may be noted that all other National Law Schools have the Chief Justice of the respective state High Courts as their Chancellors.\n\nThe university was the brainchild of then Chief Minister [[Jyoti Basu]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Office of Speaker Lok Sabha |url=https://speakerloksabha.nic.in/speech/SpeechDetails.asp?SpeechId=225 |website=speakerloksabha.nic.in |accessdate=28 December 2019}}</ref> Other eminent personalities without whose help and active intervention the university could not have been founded, include [[Shri|Sh.]] [[Jyoti Basu]], a former Chief Minister of West Bengal who was a [[Middle Temple]] barrister;<ref>[http://speakerloksabha.nic.in/speech/SpeechDetails.asp?SpeechId=225 Somnath Chatterjee's address at the Second Annual Convocation of the West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences, Kolkata, 23 June 2007], accessed 21 June 2008</ref> [[Shri|Sh.]] [[Somnath Chatterjee]], a former Speaker of the [[Lok Sabha]], also a Middle Temple barrister and a leading member of the Calcutta Bar Library; and [[Justice]] Chittotosh Mookerjee, a former Chief Justice of the Calcutta High Court and the Bombay High Court and the (Acting) Governor of Maharashtra. Justice Mookerjee was the university's Honorary Treasurer and has been associated with the work of the university since its inception in 1999. The NUJS is an autonomous university.\n\nInitially, classes, which started in 2000, were held at Aranya Bhavan, where the Environment Ministry of the government of West Bengal is located, and the first batches of students started living in government flats. On 28 October 2002, the university's present-day permanent campus was inaugurated by the then Chief Justice of India, B. N. Kirpal.<ref>[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2002-10-28/kolkata/27307776_1_legal-education-chief-justice-nujs Laws should be dynamic: BN Kirpal, ''Times of India'', 28 Oct 2002], accessed 21 June 2008</ref> In 2006, NUJS was allotted a {{convert|50|acre|m2|adj=on}} plot in [[Rajarhat]], an upscale township, which is being developed by the West Bengal government.\n\n==Rankings==\n{{Infobox India university ranking\n| IT_L_2017 = 3 \n| OUTLOOK_L_2017 = 2\n| WEEK_L_2017 = 4\n}} \nNUJS was ranked third by ''[[India Today]]''{{'}}s \"India's Best Colleges 2017: Law\",<ref name=Rankings_IT_L_2017/> second in India by ''[[Outlook India]]''{{'}}s  \"Top 25 Law Colleges In 2017\"<ref name=Rankings_OUTLOOK_L_2017/> and fourth in India by ''[[The Week (Indian magazine)|The Week]]''{{'}}s \"Top Law Colleges 2017\".<ref name=Rankings_WEEK_L_2017/> Despite these rankings, WBNUJS is known to be the second best law school in the country after NLSIU.\n\n==Faculty==\n[[File:NUJS_inside_view.jpg|thumb|Inside of Kolkata NUJS]]\n\nThe faculty has included a former governor of Mizoram and CBI director, Dr. A.P.

It also has a social science section. journals such as the Harvard and Cambridge Law Reviews, the law reviews of the respective National Law Universities of India, such as the NLSIU, GNLU and NALSAR, the journals of the Indian Law Institute and the Bar Council of India and social science journals such as the Social Scientist, Indian Economic and Social History Review, and the Studies in History are also kept in the library.\n\nNUJS also holds institutional memberships with leading libraries in the cities such as the British Council Library and the American Information Resource Center. Besides this, law students from other universities are encouraged to use the library for research and study.\n\nThe NUJS library houses over 20,000 titles and, owing largely to a donation from the estate of the late Justice Durga Das Basu, contains many rare books of historical importance. The reading room has computers linked to major Indian and international online legal databases.In addition to the main library, each School of the University has its library.\n\n==Degrees and courses==\n\n===B.A./B. Sc. LL. B (Hons.)===\nThe admission shall be based exclusively on the performance in the [[Common Law Admission Test]] (CLAT). \nHowever, to qualify for admission, the candidate must have passed the Higher Secondary School Examination (10+2) or an examination equivalent thereof, securing, in aggregate, not less than 50% in all the core subjects and English put together.\n\nThe five-year undergraduate course is divided into ten semesters and enrolls 125 students every year. The students represent almost all states of India and a few join from foreign countries. This programme offers advanced legal education with an emphasis on critical thinking and self-enquiry on the one hand and acquisition of practical skills and knowledge on the other.\n\n===LL.M programme===\nThe LL.M degree course is a one-year post graduate course, offering specialisations in two streams - (i) International and Comparative law (ii) Corporate and Commercial law . This programme is interested in attracting students who either wish to join academia or seek to acquire advanced research skills before joining the legal profession. The admission is based exclusively on the performance in the Common Law Admission Test (CLAT). To qualify for admission, the candidate should have secured LL.B degree or its equivalent from a recognised university, having obtained not less than 55% marks in the aggregate.\n\nThe LL.M programme comprises a range of compulsory and optional courses and a dissertation to be completed within two semesters. In the first semester, the students are expected to complete four compulsory courses and one optional course. In the second semester, they have to complete three compulsory courses, one optional course and the LL.M dissertation. These courses are identified by the Post Graduate Council (PGC) in consultation with its Faculty Council. Students are allowed to make their suggestions regarding choices/preferences of any subject or subjects to the PGC which is given due consideration. The dissertation is to be completed by the end of second semester on an approved topic under a Faculty, who is appointed by the PGC. The students are expected to make presentations on their dissertation one month in advance to their submission and also take up independent teaching assignments on certain subjects.\n\n===Master of Business Laws===\nAn online Masters in Business Laws degree (2 years) is now being offered by the University.<ref>{{cite web|title=Masters in Business Laws|url=http://mbl.nujs.edu|website=Masters in Business Laws - NUJS Kolkata|publisher=NUJS|accessdate=27 March 2016}}</ref> There are multiple specialisations also available.\n\n===Research programmes===\nNUJS offers three research programmes: M. Phil, PhD and LL.D.\n\nThe M. Phil degree programme is designed for legal academics, i.e., students who wish to pursue sustained independent study and research and are planning careers in law teaching.\n\nThe Postgraduate Council (PGC) constitutes an Advisory Committee of three members for each M.Phil student. Each student will be under the supervision of a faculty advisor. The candidate will be eligible for receipt of the degree only if he/she completes the prescribed requirements of the course within a maximum period of three years.\n\nThe PhD and LL.D degrees are two of the most advanced law degrees. The candidates to these degrees are expected to produce a thesis that will constitute a substantial and valuable contribution to legal scholarship. Since the doctoral programme is designed to train law teachers, having the opportunity to practice teaching skills is critical. The candidate is therefore given teaching assignments in addition to making presentations before the faculty community.\n\n===Diploma and post-graduate diploma===\nNUJS, in collaboration with iPleaders,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ipleaders.in/|title=iPleaders|website=ipleaders.in|accessdate=18 December 2019}}</ref> offers a diploma in Entrepreneurship Administration and Business Laws,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://startup.nujs.edu/|title=Diploma in Entrepreneurship Administration and Business Laws - NUJS, Kolkata|website=startup.nujs.edu|accessdate=18 December 2019}}</ref> which has students from 10 different countries.

Students in the course include bureaucrats, CEOs, journalists, law firm partners and investment managers.\n\nOn 29 April 2013, Vice-chancellor Prof. (Dr.) P. Ishwara Bhat issued a letter of intent<ref>http://startup.nujs.edu/PDFuploads/NUJS%20Letter%20of%20Intent%20for%20Institutional%20Arrangements.PDF{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> for educational institutions, to enter into a MoU with NUJS for its Diploma in Entrepreneurship Administration and Business Laws course. This benefits the partner institution to a greater extent in terms of quality upliftment. It is seen, that by acquiring such practical skillsets at an early stage, students catapult their careers to a farther height.\n\nIn November 2014, the University has announced an online Executive Certification Program to train HR professionals, in-house legal counsels, NGO workers, women's rights activists and compliance professionals on sexual harassment prevention and workplace diversity management. The program is titled \"Executive Certification on Sexual Harassment Prevention and Workplace Diversity Management\".<ref>{{cite web|author=The WB National University of Juridical Sciences Kolkata India |url=http://sexualharassment.nujs.edu/ |title=Online Executive Certification Course in Sexual Harassment Prevention and Workplace Diversity |publisher=Nujs.edu |date=28 October 2014 |accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nNUJS used to offer a post-graduate diploma program in business law (in partnership with Rainmaker, the firm which provides logistical support in conducting All India Bar Exam),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pgdbl.nujs.edu/index.php |title=PGDBL |publisher=Pgdbl.nujs.edu |accessdate=12 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714222903/http://pgdbl.nujs.edu/index.php |archive-date=14 July 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> which has been now discontinued.

The latter comprises two, seven-storied halls of residence for girls and boys where they sleep with each other{{clarify|date=March 2020}} and a double-storied faculty accommodation house-cum-guest house. The university's academic block, christened after [[B.R. Ambedkar]], is a four-storied octagonal structure that opens inwardly to a lawn. The building houses classrooms, a library and reading room, two conference halls, offices and an auditorium.\n\nNUJS's main campus is located on a {{convert|5|acre|m2|adj=on}} plot in Salt Lake City, overseeing the [[Eastern Metropolitan Bypass]]. The [[National Institute of Fashion Technology]]  and the College of Leather Technology border the Campus. The Hyatt Regency and the ITC Sheraton Sonar Bangla, two of Kolkata's largest luxury hotels are situated close to the Campus. The Salt Lake Campus was  designed by the architectural firm Ghosh, Bose and Associates, which also designed the Hyatt Regency. Like the Hyatt Regency, NUJS' central building is an example of the [[Modern Architecture|Modernist]] school of architecture, characterised by minimalist design and open spaces. The front facade has a large, standalone, [[Doric Order|Neo-Doric style]] column that also acts as a support (this has been nicknamed by students as the \"Pillar of Justice\").\n\nNUJS's [[Rajarhat]] Campus is yet to be built. No significant construction has been undertaken and the land lies vacant.\n\nAdmission to the hostels is conducted simultaneously with admission to the university. Although most students reside in the hostels for the entire duration of their course, some local residents choose to live off campus in their homes. The hostels have a mess serving vegetarian and non-vegetarian meals. Every floor of the six- storeyed hostels has 26 single rooms and 12 double rooms. Hostel rooms are equipped with round-the-clock internet access.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Blueprint for proposed new academic block, West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences.jpg|thumb|right|Sketch of original proposed 9 storeys academic block, construction of unfinished part is due to begin in 2015]] -->\nThe hostels have their own rules of discipline, which are primarily administered by the wardens in association with students. Self-governance is encouraged for which powers are delegated to select student representatives. The hostel mess is managed by a Mess Committee managed by the residents  themselves. There is a doctor available for consultation, who visits the hostel regularly. This apart, the university organises medical help whenever needed through tie-ups with hospitals located in the Salt Lake area. The [[Corporation Bank]], a public sector undertaking, has opened a branch inside the campus and offers banking facilities, including an ATM facility.\n\n===Canteen===\nThe university has a canteen which is run by Little Sisters, a catering service that also serves the Indian Railway Traffic Service.\n\n===Sports facilities===\nThe Salt Lake Campus has limited sports facilities and the University authorities have attempted to compensate for this by arranging a tie-up with the Sports Authority of India, whose sports complex is located a few metres away from the University.  The campus has facilities for indoor sports, and has a gymnasium for use by the staff and students.\n\nThe NUJS hosts a number of inter-college events. The Sports Committee of NUJS organises one of the most popular inter-law college events in the country, known as Invicta. Law colleges from across the country participate in this three-day sports festival, held in January every year. The events forming part of the meet are [[association football|football]], [[cricket]], [[lawn tennis]], [[sport of athletics|athletics]], [[table tennis]], [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], [[badminton]], [[chess]], [[carrom]], [[cycling]] and [[throwball]]. The events are held at venues around the campus, such as the Sports Authority of India Complex, Bengal Tennis Association complex, [[Salt Lake Stadium]] (athletics), as well as the campus itself.\n\n==Student Juridical Association==\nThe student body of the University is known as the Student Juridical Association (SJA).  The SJA has an elected president and Vice-President, along with two administrative office bearers, the Administrative Secretary and the Treasurer.  The SJA has an Executive Council which is constituted by representatives from the various Student Committees of the SJA and an elected Class Representative from each of the five batches of students. The Student Committees of the SJA are committees for encouraging, organising and playing an administrative role in extracurricular activities within the student body.  Such committees include the Moot Court Society, Cultural Committee, Literary and Debating Society, Sports Committee, etc.\n\nThe university through SJA publishes its own student-run peer reviewed law journals, the bi-annual ''Journal of Indian Law and Society\". ''Another peer-reviewed journal launched by the University in 2011 is the'' Journal of Telecommunication and Broadcasting Law.\n\nThe NUJS Law Review is the official publication of NUJS and is funded directly by the University. It is independent of the SJA and its publications. It has a dedicated team of 6 editors chosen from amongst the students of NUJS. Professor M.P. Singh is the Founding Editor-in-Chief of NUJS Law Review, which is India's only quarterly law journal published by a National Law School. Conceived by Professor Singh himself, the NUJS Law Review prides itself on its unique model of functioning with an in-house team of authors who are rigorously groomed to undertake editing and managerial responsibilities of ''NUJS Law Review''.\n\n==Legal Aid Society==\n[[File:Members of the Legal Aid Society, West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences (Midnapore Law Camp, 2007).jpg|thumb|right|Members of the Legal Aid Society, assisted by teachers, offering free legal help at [[Midnapore]].]]\n\n{{see also|Legal clinic}}\n\nThe Legal Aid Society has undertaken the following categories of activities:\n* Legal Aid Clinic and Counseling: The Legal Aid Clinic has been set up as a permanent body to provide free legal advice and resolution of disputes without long drawn and expensive litigation. This is done by providing legal and para-legal assistance. The clinic is presided over by the faculty advisor, Shri N. Konar, a former judge. Assistance is also provided by other former judges in the faculty. The clinic has been functional since 9 November 2002 and has tendered advice to several cases.\n* Human Rights and Public Education: For empowering people through legal education and instilling in them consciousness about their rights and duties.  This is done through field visits in semi-urban and rural areas as well as publicised seminars and workshops within the university itself.\n* Youth for Social Justice: A social awareness program that targets young people with the objective of ingraining in impressionable minds a sense of social justice.\n* Law Enforcement Assistance: This subcommittee works with law enforcement authorities such as the police, Government, pollution control board, for providing an interface to people to promote [[legal awareness]] and law-enforcement.\n* Para Legal Services and Training: The purpose of this activity is to build relationships with other agencies that work in the field such as NGOs, to facilitate exchange of information.  The Society seeks to provide training and services in the form of documental consultancy and research to these agencies.\n* Public Interest Advocacy Support services: In the form of documentation, obtaining empirical data and other allied research are to be provided for public advocacy of popular concerns and public interest litigations.\n* Lok Adalat and ADR assistance: As part of its goal to encourage alternate dispute resolution, the Legal Aid Society organises Lok Adalats in association with the W.B. Legal Aid Authority.  Till date one Lok Adalat, specially for women was held in November 2003.\n\n==Mooting achievements==\n[[File:NUJS team winners at WTO moot.jpg|left|thumb|Winners of ELSA Moot Court Competition 2015 at the World Trade Organisation headquarters in Geneva.

The Founder-[[Vice-Chancellor]] was [[Professor]] [[N.R. Madhava Menon]], a former Professor of law of Delhi University and Founder-Director, [[National Law School of India University]] (NLSIU), Bangalore, who is credited with revolutionising the field of legal education in India, by starting the concept of \"national law schools\", as opposed to the traditional law colleges prevalent before.\n\nThe NUJS, Kolkata, along with the NLSIU, Bengaluru, remain the only two national law schools which have the honourable Chief Justice of India as the Chancellor. This set-up provides an aura of exclusivity and rare stature to these National Law Schools in India. It may be noted that all other National Law Schools have the Chief Justice of the respective state High Courts as their Chancellors.\n\nThe university was the brainchild of then Chief Minister [[Jyoti Basu]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Office of Speaker Lok Sabha |url=https://speakerloksabha.nic.in/speech/SpeechDetails.asp?SpeechId=225 |website=speakerloksabha.nic.in |accessdate=28 December 2019}}</ref> Other eminent personalities without whose help and active intervention the university could not have been founded, include [[Shri|Sh.]] [[Jyoti Basu]], a former Chief Minister of West Bengal who was a [[Middle Temple]] barrister;<ref>[http://speakerloksabha.nic.in/speech/SpeechDetails.asp?SpeechId=225 Somnath Chatterjee's address at the Second Annual Convocation of the West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences, Kolkata, 23 June 2007], accessed 21 June 2008</ref> [[Shri|Sh.]] [[Somnath Chatterjee]], a former Speaker of the [[Lok Sabha]], also a Middle Temple barrister and a leading member of the Calcutta Bar Library; and [[Justice]] Chittotosh Mookerjee, a former Chief Justice of the Calcutta High Court and the Bombay High Court and the (Acting) Governor of Maharashtra. Justice Mookerjee was the university's Honorary Treasurer and has been associated with the work of the university since its inception in 1999. The NUJS is an autonomous university.\n\nInitially, classes, which started in 2000, were held at Aranya Bhavan, where the Environment Ministry of the government of West Bengal is located, and the first batches of students started living in government flats. On 28 October 2002, the university's present-day permanent campus was inaugurated by the then Chief Justice of India, B. N. Kirpal.<ref>[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2002-10-28/kolkata/27307776_1_legal-education-chief-justice-nujs Laws should be dynamic: BN Kirpal, ''Times of India'', 28 Oct 2002], accessed 21 June 2008</ref> In 2006, NUJS was allotted a {{convert|50|acre|m2|adj=on}} plot in [[Rajarhat]], an upscale township, which is being developed by the West Bengal government.\n\n==Rankings==\n{{Infobox India university ranking\n| IT_L_2017 = 3 \n| OUTLOOK_L_2017 = 2\n| WEEK_L_2017 = 4\n}} \nNUJS was ranked third by ''[[India Today]]''{{'}}s \"India's Best Colleges 2017: Law\",<ref name=Rankings_IT_L_2017/> second in India by ''[[Outlook India]]''{{'}}s  \"Top 25 Law Colleges In 2017\"<ref name=Rankings_OUTLOOK_L_2017/> and fourth in India by ''[[The Week (Indian magazine)|The Week]]''{{'}}s \"Top Law Colleges 2017\".<ref name=Rankings_WEEK_L_2017/> Despite these rankings, WBNUJS is known to be the second best law school in the country after NLSIU.\n\n==Faculty==\n[[File:NUJS_inside_view.jpg|thumb|Inside of Kolkata NUJS]]\n\nThe faculty has included a former governor of Mizoram and CBI director, Dr. A.P.

It also has a social science section. journals such as the Harvard and Cambridge Law Reviews, the law reviews of the respective National Law Universities of India, such as the NLSIU, GNLU and NALSAR, the journals of the Indian Law Institute and the Bar Council of India and social science journals such as the Social Scientist, Indian Economic and Social History Review, and the Studies in History are also kept in the library.\n\nNUJS also holds institutional memberships with leading libraries in the cities such as the British Council Library and the American Information Resource Center. Besides this, law students from other universities are encouraged to use the library for research and study.\n\nThe NUJS library houses over 20,000 titles and, owing largely to a donation from the estate of the late Justice Durga Das Basu, contains many rare books of historical importance. The reading room has computers linked to major Indian and international online legal databases.In addition to the main library, each School of the University has its library.\n\n==Degrees and courses==\n\n===B.A./B. Sc. LL. B (Hons.)===\nThe admission shall be based exclusively on the performance in the [[Common Law Admission Test]] (CLAT). \nHowever, to qualify for admission, the candidate must have passed the Higher Secondary School Examination (10+2) or an examination equivalent thereof, securing, in aggregate, not less than 50% in all the core subjects and English put together.\n\nThe five-year undergraduate course is divided into ten semesters and enrolls 125 students every year. The students represent almost all states of India and a few join from foreign countries. This programme offers advanced legal education with an emphasis on critical thinking and self-enquiry on the one hand and acquisition of practical skills and knowledge on the other.\n\n===LL.M programme===\nThe LL.M degree course is a one-year post graduate course, offering specialisations in two streams - (i) International and Comparative law (ii) Corporate and Commercial law . This programme is interested in attracting students who either wish to join academia or seek to acquire advanced research skills before joining the legal profession. The admission is based exclusively on the performance in the Common Law Admission Test (CLAT). To qualify for admission, the candidate should have secured LL.B degree or its equivalent from a recognised university, having obtained not less than 55% marks in the aggregate.\n\nThe LL.M programme comprises a range of compulsory and optional courses and a dissertation to be completed within two semesters. In the first semester, the students are expected to complete four compulsory courses and one optional course. In the second semester, they have to complete three compulsory courses, one optional course and the LL.M dissertation. These courses are identified by the Post Graduate Council (PGC) in consultation with its Faculty Council. Students are allowed to make their suggestions regarding choices/preferences of any subject or subjects to the PGC which is given due consideration. The dissertation is to be completed by the end of second semester on an approved topic under a Faculty, who is appointed by the PGC. The students are expected to make presentations on their dissertation one month in advance to their submission and also take up independent teaching assignments on certain subjects.\n\n===Master of Business Laws===\nAn online Masters in Business Laws degree (2 years) is now being offered by the University.<ref>{{cite web|title=Masters in Business Laws|url=http://mbl.nujs.edu|website=Masters in Business Laws - NUJS Kolkata|publisher=NUJS|accessdate=27 March 2016}}</ref> There are multiple specialisations also available.\n\n===Research programmes===\nNUJS offers three research programmes: M. Phil, PhD and LL.D.\n\nThe M. Phil degree programme is designed for legal academics, i.e., students who wish to pursue sustained independent study and research and are planning careers in law teaching.\n\nThe Postgraduate Council (PGC) constitutes an Advisory Committee of three members for each M.Phil student. Each student will be under the supervision of a faculty advisor. The candidate will be eligible for receipt of the degree only if he/she completes the prescribed requirements of the course within a maximum period of three years.\n\nThe PhD and LL.D degrees are two of the most advanced law degrees. The candidates to these degrees are expected to produce a thesis that will constitute a substantial and valuable contribution to legal scholarship. Since the doctoral programme is designed to train law teachers, having the opportunity to practice teaching skills is critical. The candidate is therefore given teaching assignments in addition to making presentations before the faculty community.\n\n===Diploma and post-graduate diploma===\nNUJS, in collaboration with iPleaders,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ipleaders.in/|title=iPleaders|website=ipleaders.in|accessdate=18 December 2019}}</ref> offers a diploma in Entrepreneurship Administration and Business Laws,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://startup.nujs.edu/|title=Diploma in Entrepreneurship Administration and Business Laws - NUJS, Kolkata|website=startup.nujs.edu|accessdate=18 December 2019}}</ref> which has students from 10 different countries.

Students in the course include bureaucrats, CEOs, journalists, law firm partners and investment managers.\n\nOn 29 April 2013, Vice-chancellor Prof. (Dr.) P. Ishwara Bhat issued a letter of intent<ref>http://startup.nujs.edu/PDFuploads/NUJS%20Letter%20of%20Intent%20for%20Institutional%20Arrangements.PDF{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> for educational institutions, to enter into a MoU with NUJS for its Diploma in Entrepreneurship Administration and Business Laws course. This benefits the partner institution to a greater extent in terms of quality upliftment. It is seen, that by acquiring such practical skillsets at an early stage, students catapult their careers to a farther height.\n\nIn November 2014, the University has announced an online Executive Certification Program to train HR professionals, in-house legal counsels, NGO workers, women's rights activists and compliance professionals on sexual harassment prevention and workplace diversity management. The program is titled \"Executive Certification on Sexual Harassment Prevention and Workplace Diversity Management\".<ref>{{cite web|author=The WB National University of Juridical Sciences Kolkata India |url=http://sexualharassment.nujs.edu/ |title=Online Executive Certification Course in Sexual Harassment Prevention and Workplace Diversity |publisher=Nujs.edu |date=28 October 2014 |accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nNUJS used to offer a post-graduate diploma program in business law (in partnership with Rainmaker, the firm which provides logistical support in conducting All India Bar Exam),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pgdbl.nujs.edu/index.php |title=PGDBL |publisher=Pgdbl.nujs.edu |accessdate=12 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714222903/http://pgdbl.nujs.edu/index.php |archive-date=14 July 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> which has been now discontinued.

The latter comprises two, seven-storied halls of residence for girls and boys where they sleep with each other{{what|date=March 2020}} and a double-storied faculty accommodation house-cum-guest house. The university's academic block, christened after [[B.R. Ambedkar]], is a four-storied octagonal structure that opens inwardly to a lawn. The building houses classrooms, a library and reading room, two conference halls, offices and an auditorium.\n\nNUJS's main campus is located on a {{convert|5|acre|m2|adj=on}} plot in Salt Lake City, overseeing the [[Eastern Metropolitan Bypass]]. The [[National Institute of Fashion Technology]]  and the College of Leather Technology border the Campus. The Hyatt Regency and the ITC Sheraton Sonar Bangla, two of Kolkata's largest luxury hotels are situated close to the Campus. The Salt Lake Campus was  designed by the architectural firm Ghosh, Bose and Associates, which also designed the Hyatt Regency. Like the Hyatt Regency, NUJS' central building is an example of the [[Modern Architecture|Modernist]] school of architecture, characterised by minimalist design and open spaces. The front facade has a large, standalone, [[Doric Order|Neo-Doric style]] column that also acts as a support (this has been nicknamed by students as the \"Pillar of Justice\").\n\nNUJS's [[Rajarhat]] Campus is yet to be built. No significant construction has been undertaken and the land lies vacant.\n\nAdmission to the hostels is conducted simultaneously with admission to the university. Although most students reside in the hostels for the entire duration of their course, some local residents choose to live off campus in their homes. The hostels have a mess serving vegetarian and non-vegetarian meals. Every floor of the six- storeyed hostels has 26 single rooms and 12 double rooms. Hostel rooms are equipped with round-the-clock internet access.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Blueprint for proposed new academic block, West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences.jpg|thumb|right|Sketch of original proposed 9 storeys academic block, construction of unfinished part is due to begin in 2015]] -->\nThe hostels have their own rules of discipline, which are primarily administered by the wardens in association with students. Self-governance is encouraged for which powers are delegated to select student representatives. The hostel mess is managed by a Mess Committee managed by the residents  themselves. There is a doctor available for consultation, who visits the hostel regularly. This apart, the university organises medical help whenever needed through tie-ups with hospitals located in the Salt Lake area. The [[Corporation Bank]], a public sector undertaking, has opened a branch inside the campus and offers banking facilities, including an ATM facility.\n\n===Canteen===\nThe university has a canteen which is run by Little Sisters, a catering service that also serves the Indian Railway Traffic Service.\n\n===Sports facilities===\nThe Salt Lake Campus has limited sports facilities and the University authorities have attempted to compensate for this by arranging a tie-up with the Sports Authority of India, whose sports complex is located a few metres away from the University.  The campus has facilities for indoor sports, and has a gymnasium for use by the staff and students.\n\nThe NUJS hosts a number of inter-college events. The Sports Committee of NUJS organises one of the most popular inter-law college events in the country, known as Invicta. Law colleges from across the country participate in this three-day sports festival, held in January every year. The events forming part of the meet are [[association football|football]], [[cricket]], [[lawn tennis]], [[sport of athletics|athletics]], [[table tennis]], [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], [[badminton]], [[chess]], [[carrom]], [[cycling]] and [[throwball]]. The events are held at venues around the campus, such as the Sports Authority of India Complex, Bengal Tennis Association complex, [[Salt Lake Stadium]] (athletics), as well as the campus itself.\n\n==Student Juridical Association==\nThe student body of the University is known as the Student Juridical Association (SJA).  The SJA has an elected President and Vice-President, along with two administrative office bearers, the Administrative Secretary and the Treasurer.  The SJA has an Executive Council which is constituted by representatives from the various Student Committees of the SJA and an elected Class Representative from each of the five batches of students. The Student Committees of the SJA are committees for encouraging, organising and playing an administrative role in extracurricular activities within the student body.  Such committees include the Moot Court Society, Cultural Committee, Literary and Debating Society, Sports Committee, etc.\n\nThe university through SJA publishes its own student-run peer reviewed law journals, the bi-annual ''Journal of Indian Law and Society\". ''Another peer-reviewed journal launched by the University in 2011 is the'' Journal of Telecommunication and Broadcasting Law.\n\nThe NUJS Law Review is the official publication of NUJS and is funded directly by the University. It is independent of the SJA and its publications. It has a dedicated team of 6 editors chosen from amongst the students of NUJS. Professor M.P. Singh is the Founding Editor-in-Chief of NUJS Law Review, which is India's only quarterly law journal published by a National Law School. Conceived by Professor Singh himself, the NUJS Law Review prides itself on its unique model of functioning with an in-house team of authors who are rigorously groomed to undertake editing and managerial responsibilities of ''NUJS Law Review''.\n\n==Legal Aid Society==\n[[File:Members of the Legal Aid Society, West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences (Midnapore Law Camp, 2007).jpg|thumb|right|Members of the Legal Aid Society, assisted by teachers, offering free legal help at [[Midnapore]].]]\n\n{{see also|Legal clinic}}\n\nThe Legal Aid Society has undertaken the following categories of activities:\n* Legal Aid Clinic and Counseling: The Legal Aid Clinic has been set up as a permanent body to provide free legal advice and resolution of disputes without long drawn and expensive litigation. This is done by providing legal and para-legal assistance. The clinic is presided over by the faculty advisor, Shri N. Konar, a former judge. Assistance is also provided by other former judges in the faculty. The clinic has been functional since 9 November 2002 and has tendered advice to several cases.\n* Human Rights and Public Education: For empowering people through legal education and instilling in them consciousness about their rights and duties.  This is done through field visits in semi-urban and rural areas as well as publicised seminars and workshops within the university itself.\n* Youth for Social Justice: A social awareness program that targets young people with the objective of ingraining in impressionable minds a sense of social justice.\n* Law Enforcement Assistance: This subcommittee works with law enforcement authorities such as the police, Government, pollution control board, for providing an interface to people to promote [[legal awareness]] and law-enforcement.\n* Para Legal Services and Training: The purpose of this activity is to build relationships with other agencies that work in the field such as NGOs, to facilitate exchange of information.  The Society seeks to provide training and services in the form of documental consultancy and research to these agencies.\n* Public Interest Advocacy Support services: In the form of documentation, obtaining empirical data and other allied research are to be provided for public advocacy of popular concerns and public interest litigations.\n* Lok Adalat and ADR assistance: As part of its goal to encourage alternate dispute resolution, the Legal Aid Society organises Lok Adalats in association with the W.B. Legal Aid Authority.  Till date one Lok Adalat, specially for women was held in November 2003.\n\n==Mooting achievements==\n[[File:NUJS team winners at WTO moot.jpg|left|thumb|Winners of ELSA Moot Court Competition 2015 at the World Trade Organisation headquarters in Geneva.

Corbett had an old bass guitar and a gift certificate to a local music store, so they rented a drum kit and started playing in Corbett's parents\u2019 basement with Corbett on drums, Gullen playing the bass, and Currie playing a recently purchased electric guitar. The band began with a repertoire of 1970's blues-rock songs as well as newer material, including covers of the early [[The Black Keys|Black Keys]] and [[Kings of Leon]], while also writing their own music. Currie, Gullen, and Corbett called their trio The Breaks and released an EP in 2006.<ref name=RollingStone>{{cite magazine|last=Scaggs |first=Austin |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/meet-the-sheepdogs-161748/ |title=Meet the Sheepdogs |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=2011-08-18}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 2006, Currie, Gullen, and Corbett met Leot Hanson, who was playing acoustic guitar at a party. Hanson was playing a [[Kings of Leon]] song from [[Youth & Young Manhood]], and the trio joined in. The next day, Hanson joined the band and they changed their name to The Sheepdogs.<ref name=RollingStone/>\n\nIn 2006, The Sheepdogs independently released their first album ''Trying to Grow'', which they recorded at Cosmic Pad Studios in [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]]. Two years later, after almost constant touring, The Sheepdogs returned to Cosmic Pad Studios to record their second full-length album, ''Big Stand''. The first two records were small affairs, including artwork by friends and family, and were mixed by the band.<ref name=Now></ref><ref name=CVW>{{cite web |title=The Sheepdogs ''Changing Colours'' (Dine Alone/Warner Music) |url=http://coachellavalleyweekly.com/the-sheepdogs-changing-colours-atlantic-records/ |first=Eleni P. |last=Austin |work=CV Weekly |publisher=CoachellaValleyWeekly.com |date=July 17, 2019}}</ref> \n\nThe band released its third studio album, ''[[Learn & Burn]]'', in 2010. The band recorded the album on their own, with their own equipment, a circumstance which they appreciated for giving them freedom to explore new sounds and techniques, including a nod to the psychedelic rock of the 1960s. <ref>{{cite web |title=The Sheepdogs learn to burn |url=https://thesheaf.com/2010/03/17/the-sheepdogs-learn-to-burn/ |first=Greg |last=Reese |work=The Sheaf |publisher=thesheaf.com |date=March 17, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===''Rolling Stone'' Cover Contest: ''Learn & Burn Deluxe'', ''Five Easy Pieces'' EP  (2011)===\n\nIn Early 2011, a music manager that the band had met in Toronto submitted a demo tape to Atlantic Records which resulted in them being one of 16 bands chosen to be part of the ''Rolling Stone'' \u201cChoose the Cover\u201d competition\u201d<ref>{{cite news |author=Simona Rabinovich |title=Saskatoon's the Sheepdogs land cover of Rolling Stone |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/music/saskatoons-the-sheepdogs-land-cover-of-rolling-stone/article588979/ |work=The Globe and Mail |location= Toronto, Ontario |date=August 1, 2011}}</ref> With the new international spotlight on the band and while the band was waiting to find out the results of the contest, ''Learn & Burn'' was given a re-release, in May.

Corbett had an old bass guitar and a gift certificate to a local music store, so they rented a drum kit and started playing in Corbett's parents\u2019 basement with Corbett on drums, Gullen playing the bass, and Currie playing a recently purchased electric guitar. The band began with a repertoire of 1970's blues-rock songs as well as newer material, including covers of the early [[The Black Keys|Black Keys]] and [[Kings of Leon]], while also writing their own music. Currie, Gullen, and Corbett called their trio The Breaks and released an EP in 2006.<ref name=RollingStone>{{cite magazine|last=Scaggs |first=Austin |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/meet-the-sheepdogs-161748/ |title=Meet the Sheepdogs |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=2011-08-18}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 2006, Currie, Gullen, and Corbett met Leot Hanson, who was playing acoustic guitar at a party. Hanson was playing a [[Kings of Leon]] song from [[Youth & Young Manhood]], and the trio joined in. The next day, Hanson joined the band and they changed their name to The Sheepdogs.<ref name=RollingStone/>\n\nIn 2006, The Sheepdogs independently released their first album ''Trying to Grow'', which they recorded at Cosmic Pad Studios in [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]]. Two years later, after almost constant touring, The Sheepdogs returned to Cosmic Pad Studios to record their second full-length album, ''Big Stand''. The first two records were small affairs, including artwork by friends and family, and were mixed by the band.<ref name=Now></ref><ref name=CVW>{{cite web |title=The Sheepdogs ''Changing Colours'' (Dine Alone/Warner Music) |url=http://coachellavalleyweekly.com/the-sheepdogs-changing-colours-atlantic-records/ |first=Eleni P. |last=Austin |work=CV Weekly |publisher=CoachellaValleyWeekly.com |date=July 17, 2019}}</ref> \n\nThe band released its third studio album, ''[[Learn & Burn]]'', in 2010.

It is located within [[Tokyo]], [[Saitama Prefecture|Saitama]], and [[Gunma Prefecture]]s in Japan. It connects [[Hachi\u014dji Station]] in [[Hachi\u014dji, Tokyo]] with [[Kuragano Station]] in [[Takasaki]], Gunma Prefecture.\n\n==Services==\n[[Komagawa Station]] in [[Hidaka, Saitama]] is the boundary point between two distinct sections. The southern section from Hachi\u014dji to Komagawa is electrified at 1,500 V DC. Some trains terminate at Komagawa, while others continue over the [[Kawagoe Line]] to [[Kawagoe Station]]. A few trains leave the Hachik\u014d Line at [[Haijima Station]], entering the [[\u014cme Line]] and terminating at [[Tokyo Station]].\n\nThe non-electrified northern section connects Komagawa with Kuragano. All trains continue on the [[Takasaki Line]] to {{STN|Takasaki}}, where transfer to the [[J\u014detsu Shinkansen]] is available. There are no through services connecting the southern and northern halves of the line.\n\nThe Hachik\u014d Line takes the first ''[[kanji]]'' of its name from the first character of {{Nihongo|Hachi\u014dji|\u516b\u738b\u5b50}} and the second ''kanji'' from the first character of {{Nihongo|Takasaki|\u9ad8\u5d0e}}.\n\n==Stations==\n* All trains stop at every station.\n* Stations marked \"o\" or \"^\" allow passing; stations marked\"<nowiki>|</nowiki>\" do not. Stations marked \"\u2225\" are double-tracked.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" rules=\"all\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Station\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Japanese\n!colspan=\"2\"|Distance

Line'''|\u516b\u9ad8\u7dda|Hachik\u014d-sen}} is a 92.0&nbsp;km regional [[railway line]] owned and operated by [[East Japan Railway Company]] (JR East). It is located within [[Tokyo]], [[Saitama Prefecture|Saitama]], and [[Gunma Prefecture]]s in Japan. It connects [[Hachi\u014dji Station]] in [[Hachi\u014dji, Tokyo]] with [[Kuragano Station]] in [[Takasaki]], Gunma Prefecture.\n\n==Services==\n[[Komagawa Station]] in [[Hidaka, Saitama]] is the boundary point between two distinct sections. The southern section from Hachi\u014dji to Komagawa is electrified at 1,500 V DC. Some trains terminate at Komagawa, while others continue over the [[Kawagoe Line]] to [[Kawagoe Station]]. A few trains leave the Hachik\u014d Line at [[Haijima Station]], entering the [[\u014cme Line]] and terminating at [[Tokyo Station]].\n\nThe non-electrified northern section connects Komagawa with Kuragano. All trains continue on the [[Takasaki Line]] to {{STN|Takasaki}}, where transfer to the [[J\u014detsu Shinkansen]] is available. There are no through services connecting the southern and northern halves of the line.\n\nThe Hachik\u014d Line takes the first ''[[kanji]]'' of its name from the first character of {{Nihongo|Hachi\u014dji|\u516b\u738b\u5b50}} and the second ''kanji'' from the first character of {{Nihongo|Takasaki|\u9ad8\u5d0e}}.\n\n==Stations==\n* All trains stop at every station.\n* Stations marked \"o\" or \"^\" allow passing; stations marked\"<nowiki>|</nowiki>\" do not.

The city of [[Vadodara]] (Baroda), in the western part of the district, is the administrative headquarters. Vadodara District covers an area of 7,794&nbsp;km\u00b2. As of 2011, the district had a population of 4,165,626 of which 49.6% were urban, 50.4% were rural, 5.3% were scheduled castes and 27.6% were scheduled tribes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.censusindia.co.in/district/vadodara-district-gujarat-486|title=Vadodara District Population, Caste, Religion Data (Gujarat) - Census 2011|publisher=Census India}}</ref> As of 2011 it is the third most populous district of Gujarat (out of [[Districts of Gujarat|33]]), after [[Ahmedabad district|Ahmadabad]] and [[Surat district|Surat]].<ref name=\"districtcensus\">{{cite web | url = http://www.census2011.co.in/district.php | title = District Census 2011 | accessdate = 2011-09-30 | year = 2011 | publisher = Census2011.co.in}}</ref>\n\nThe district is bounded by [[Panchmahal]] district to the north,  [[Anand District|Anand]] and [[Kheda District|Kheda]] districts to the west, [[Bharuch District|Bharuch]] and [[Narmada District|Narmada]] districts to the south, and Chhota Udaipur to the east. The [[Mahi River]] passes through the district.\n\nThe historical city of [[Vadodara|Baroda]] was the capital of Baroda Residency, and one of the [[princely states]] of India under [[Bombay Presidency]].\n\n==Origin of name==\nBaroda is situated on the banks of the [[river Vishwamitri]] (whose name is derived from the saint [[Rishi Vishwamitra]]). The city was once called Chandravati, after its ruler [[Raja Chandan]], then Viravati, the abode of the brave, and then Vadpatra because of the abundance of banyan trees on the banks of the Vishwamitri. From Vadpatra it derived its present name Baroda or Vadodara.  Vadodara name came into existence as Vad (Banyan Tree) Dara (worn - Meaning covered with Vadvruksh) and hence it came as Vadodara.  Anybody can see lot of Banyan Tree in and around Vadodara.\n\n==History==\nModern Vadodara is a memorial to its late ruler, [[Sayaji Rao Gaekwad III]] (1875\u20131939). It was the dream of this able administrator to make Vadodara an educational, industrial and commercial centre.\n\nVadodara has a rich historical background. The historian can trace Vadodara's history over 2000 years and more. However, the recent threads can be picked up when the Mughal rule over the city came to an end in 1732, when [[Pilaji]] brought the Maratha activities in Southern Gujarat to a head and captured it. Except for a short break, Vadodara continued to be in the hands of the Gaekwads from 1734 to 1949.\n\nThe greatest period in the Maratha rule of Vadodara started with the accession of Maharaja Sayajirao III in 1875. It was an era of great progress and constructive achievements in all fields.\n\nMaharaja Sayajirao was one of the foremost administrators and reformers of his times. He initiated a series of bold socio-economic reforms. He attached great importance to economic development and started a number of model industries to encourage initiative, and then handed back the working industries to private enterprise. He started model textile and tile factories. It is as a result of his policy of industrial development that Vadodara is today one of the most important centers for textile, chemical, Pharmaceutical, Electrical, Mechanical and oil industries today. He introduced a number of social reforms. In no department of administration has the far-sighted policy of this wise ruler been more conspicuous than in education, and in none have the results been more real and tangible. He boldly introduced compulsory primary education and a library movement (the first of its kind in India) to augment his adult education scheme.\n\nIt was he who visualised a general scheme of development in all branches of knowledge at different stages, with the Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda at the apex. Modern Vadodara owes its beauty, its educational institutions and its masterpieces of architecture to the insight and vision of this great ruler.\n\n==Geography==\n\nThe physiography of Vadodara features a number of rivers. The main city of [[Vadodara]] is located on the banks of river [[Vishwamitri River|Vishwamitri]]. Besides, the topography of Vadodara also features [[Narmada]] river to its south and [[Mahi river]] to its north.\n\n===Climate===\n\nThe '''Vadodara''' district has a dry climate and three distinct seasons, namely [[summer]], [[winter]] and [[monsoon]].\n\n{{climate chart\n|Vadodara\n|12|29|1\n|13|32|0\n|18|36|1\n|22|39|0\n|26|40|3\n|26|36|129\n|25|32|290\n|24|31|274\n|24|32|147\n|21|35|21\n|16|33|16\n|16|30|3\n|source=[http://www.mausam.gov.in/WEBIMD/ClimatologicalAction.do?function=getStationDetails&actionParam=1&param=2&station=Baroda%20%28A%29 IMD]\n|float=right\n|clear=none\n}}\n\n==Economy==\n{{expand section|date=January 2008}}\nVadodara's Industrial Growth\nVadodara City runs through the golden corridor, from Ahmedabad to Vapi, and is one of India's foremost industrial centres with dominant groups of chemicals and pharmaceuticals, cotton textiles and machine tools. The city witnessed a sudden spurt in industrial activity with the establishment of the Gujarat refinery in 1962. Various large-scale industries such as Gujarat State Fertilizers and Chemicals (GSFC), Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Limited (IPCL) and Gujarat Alkalis and Chemicals Limited (GACL) have come up in the vicinity of the Gujarat Refinery. The establishment of large industrial units in this region has automatically brought into existence a number of smaller enterprises. Several factors like raw material availability, product demand, and skillful mobilisation of human, financial and material resources by the government and private entrepreneurs had contributed to Vadodara's efflorescence as one of India's foremost industrial centres.\n\n==Divisions==\n[[Image:Map GujDist CentralEast.png|thumb|200px|right|Districts of central Gujarat]]\nVadodara is divided into 2 Prants:<ref name=Collector>{{cite web |publisher=Vadodara District Collectorate|title=Collectorate of Vadodara|url=http://collectorvadodara.gujarat.gov.in |accessdate=2007-06-30}}</ref>\n# [[Vadodara]]\n# [[Dabhoi]]\n\nVadodara is divided into 8 [[taluka]]s:<ref name=Collector/>\n\n# [[Dabhoi]]\n# [[Karjan]]\n# [[Padra]]\n# [[Savli]]\n# [[Sinor, Gujarat|Sinor]]\n# [[Vadodara]] City\n# Vadodara Rural\n# [[Waghodia]]\n\n==Demographics==\n{{historical populations|11=1901|12=5,75,650|13=1911|14=6,79,540|15=1921|16=7,36,050|17=1931|18=8,56,580|19=1941|20=10,19,524|21=1951|22=11,81,782|23=1961|24=14,90,144|25=1971|26=19,36,523|27=1981|28=25,09,431|29=1991|30=30,38,127|31=2001|32=36,41,802|33=2011|34=41,65,626|percentages=pagr|footnote=source:<ref>[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/PCA/A2_Data_Table.html Decadal Variation In Population Since 1901]</ref>|align=right}}{{bar box\n|title=Religions in Vadodara District\n|titlebar=#Fcd116\n|left1=Religion\n|right1=Percent\n|float=right\n|bars=\n{{bar percent|[[Hindus]]|orange|89.16}}\n{{bar percent|[[Muslims]]|green|09.23}}\n}}\nAccording to the [[2011 census of India|2011 census]] Vadodara district has a [[Demographics of India|population]] of 4,165,626,..<ref name=\"districtcensus\"/><ref name=districtcensus/><ref name=\"cia\">{{cite web | author = US Directorate of Intelligence | title = Country Comparison:Population | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2119rank.html | accessdate = 2011-10-01 | quote = \nLebanon 4,143,101 July 2011 est.\n }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php|title=2010 Resident Population Data|publisher=U.

However, it could not maintain the momentum of growth; the growth rate slowed down to 26% in the last decade. The population registered in 2001 was 13.06 lakhs as against 10.31 lakhs 1991. The compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) has been steadily declining from 4.64% in 1971\u201381 to 3.45% in 1981\u20131991, and further to 2.39% in 1991\u20132001.\nThe population in 2005 has been estimated at around 14.69 lakhs. The population projection for 2011 is estimated around 17.54 lakhs and is based on the hypothesis that the city would grow at a constant rate due to the increasing urbanisation in the state. The trend also shows that the population would increase at a stabilised average annual growth rate of 2.99% from 2005 to 2011.\nThe population density of the city has increased from 9527 per km<sup>2</sup> in 1991 to 12064 per km<sup>2</sup> in 2001. However, this density reduced to 9925 per km<sup>2</sup> due to the addition of new areas (148&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) in 2002. The jurisdiction of Vadodara city has further increased in February 2006 and covers urbanised areas of around 15\u201320&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, on the northern side of the city.\n\na.

eastern part of the state of [[Gujarat]] in western [[India]]. The city of [[Vadodara]] (Baroda), in the western part of the district, is the administrative headquarters. Vadodara District covers an area of 7,794&nbsp;km\u00b2. As of 2011, the district had a population of 4,165,626 of which 49.6% were urban, 50.4% were rural, 5.3% were scheduled castes and 27.6% were scheduled tribes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.censusindia.co.in/district/vadodara-district-gujarat-486|title=Vadodara District Population, Caste, Religion Data (Gujarat) - Census 2011|publisher=Census India}}</ref> As of 2011 it is the third most populous district of Gujarat (out of [[Districts of Gujarat|33]]), after [[Ahmedabad district|Ahmadabad]] and [[Surat district|Surat]].<ref name=\"districtcensus\">{{cite web | url = http://www.census2011.co.in/district.php | title = District Census 2011 | accessdate = 2011-09-30 | year = 2011 | publisher = Census2011.co.in}}</ref>\n\nThe district is bounded by [[Panchmahal]] district to the north,  [[Anand District|Anand]] and [[Kheda District|Kheda]] districts to the west, [[Bharuch District|Bharuch]] and [[Narmada District|Narmada]] districts to the south, and Chhota Udaipur to the east. The [[Mahi River]] passes through the district.\n\nThe historical city of [[Vadodara|Baroda]] was the capital of Baroda Residency, and one of the [[princely states]] of India under [[Bombay Presidency]].\n\n==Origin of name==\nBaroda is situated on the banks of the [[river Vishwamitri]] (whose name is derived from the saint [[Rishi Vishwamitra]]). The city was once called Chandravati, after its ruler [[Raja Chandan]], then Viravati, the abode of the brave, and then Vadpatra because of the abundance of banyan trees on the banks of the Vishwamitri. From Vadpatra it derived its present name Baroda or Vadodara.  Vadodara name came into existence as Vad (Banyan Tree) Dara (worn - Meaning covered with Vadvruksh) and hence it came as Vadodara.  Anybody can see lot of Banyan Tree in and around Vadodara.\n\n==History==\nModern Vadodara is a memorial to its late ruler, [[Sayaji Rao Gaekwad III]] (1875\u20131939). It was the dream of this able administrator to make Vadodara an educational, industrial and commercial centre.\n\nVadodara has a rich historical background. The historian can trace Vadodara\u2019s history over 2000 years and more. However, the recent threads can be picked up when the Mughal rule over the city came to an end in 1732, when [[Pilaji]] brought the Maratha activities in Southern Gujarat to a head and captured it. Except for a short break, Vadodara continued to be in the hands of the Gaekwads from 1734 to 1949.\n\nThe greatest period in the Maratha rule of Vadodara started with the accession of Maharaja Sayajirao III in 1875. It was an era of great progress and constructive achievements in all fields.\n\nMaharaja Sayajirao was one of the foremost administrators and reformers of his times. He initiated a series of bold socio-economic reforms. He attached great importance to economic development and started a number of model industries to encourage initiative, and then handed back the working industries to private enterprise. He started model textile and tile factories. It is as a result of his policy of industrial development that Vadodara is today one of the most important centers for textile, chemical, Pharmaceutical, Electrical, Mechanical and oil industries today. He introduced a number of social reforms. In no department of administration has the far-sighted policy of this wise ruler been more conspicuous than in education, and in none have the results been more real and tangible. He boldly introduced compulsory primary education and a library movement (the first of its kind in India) to augment his adult education scheme.\n\nIt was he who visualised a general scheme of development in all branches of knowledge at different stages, with the Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda at the apex. Modern Vadodara owes its beauty, its educational institutions and its masterpieces of architecture to the insight and vision of this great ruler.\n\n==Geography==\n\nThe physiography of Vadodara features a number of rivers. The main city of [[Vadodara]] is located on the banks of river [[Vishwamitri River|Vishwamitri]]. Besides, the topography of Vadodara also features [[Narmada]] river to its south and [[Mahi river]] to its north.\n\n===Climate===\n\nThe '''Vadodara''' district has a dry climate and three distinct seasons, namely [[summer]], [[winter]] and [[monsoon]].\n\n{{climate chart\n|Vadodara\n|12|29|1\n|13|32|0\n|18|36|1\n|22|39|0\n|26|40|3\n|26|36|129\n|25|32|290\n|24|31|274\n|24|32|147\n|21|35|21\n|16|33|16\n|16|30|3\n|source=[http://www.mausam.gov.in/WEBIMD/ClimatologicalAction.do?function=getStationDetails&actionParam=1&param=2&station=Baroda%20%28A%29 IMD]\n|float=right\n|clear=none\n}}\n\n==Economy==\n{{expand section|date=January 2008}}\nVadodara\u2019s Industrial Growth\nVadodara City runs through the golden corridor, from Ahmedabad to Vapi, and is one of India\u2019s foremost industrial centres with dominant groups of chemicals and pharmaceuticals, cotton textiles and machine tools. The city witnessed a sudden spurt in industrial activity with the establishment of the Gujarat refinery in 1962. Various large-scale industries such as Gujarat State Fertilizers and Chemicals (GSFC), Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Limited (IPCL) and Gujarat Alkalis and Chemicals Limited (GACL) have come up in the vicinity of the Gujarat Refinery. The establishment of large industrial units in this region has automatically brought into existence a number of smaller enterprises. Several factors like raw material availability, product demand, and skillful mobilisation of human, financial and material resources by the government and private entrepreneurs had contributed to Vadodara\u2019s efflorescence as one of India\u2019s foremost industrial centres.\n\n==Divisions==\n[[Image:Map GujDist CentralEast.png|thumb|200px|right|Districts of central Gujarat]]\nVadodara is divided into 2 Prants:<ref name=Collector>{{cite web |publisher=Vadodara District Collectorate|title=Collectorate of Vadodara|url=http://collectorvadodara.gujarat.gov.in |accessdate=2007-06-30}}</ref>\n# [[Vadodara]]\n# [[Dabhoi]]\n\nVadodara is divided into 8 [[taluka]]s:<ref name=Collector/>\n\n# [[Dabhoi]]\n# [[Karjan]]\n# [[Padra]]\n# [[Savli]]\n# [[Sinor, Gujarat|Sinor]]\n# [[Vadodara]] City\n# Vadodara Rural\n# [[Waghodia]]\n\n==Demographics==\n{{historical populations|11=1901|12=5,75,650|13=1911|14=6,79,540|15=1921|16=7,36,050|17=1931|18=8,56,580|19=1941|20=10,19,524|21=1951|22=11,81,782|23=1961|24=14,90,144|25=1971|26=19,36,523|27=1981|28=25,09,431|29=1991|30=30,38,127|31=2001|32=36,41,802|33=2011|34=41,65,626|percentages=pagr|footnote=source:<ref>[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/PCA/A2_Data_Table.html Decadal Variation In Population Since 1901]</ref>|align=right}}{{bar box\n|title=Religions in Vadodara District\n|titlebar=#Fcd116\n|left1=Religion\n|right1=Percent\n|float=right\n|bars=\n{{bar percent|[[Hindus]]|orange|89.16}}\n{{bar percent|[[Muslims]]|green|09.23}}\n}}\nAccording to the [[2011 census of India|2011 census]] Vadodara district has a [[Demographics of India|population]] of 4,165,626,..<ref name=\"districtcensus\"/><ref name=districtcensus/><ref name=\"cia\">{{cite web | author = US Directorate of Intelligence | title = Country Comparison:Population | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2119rank.html | accessdate = 2011-10-01 | quote = \nLebanon 4,143,101 July 2011 est.\n }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php|title=2010 Resident Population Data|publisher=U.

However, it could not maintain the momentum of growth; the growth rate slowed down to 26% in the last decade. The population registered in 2001 was 13.06 lakhs as against 10.31 lakhs 1991. The compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) has been steadily declining from 4.64% in 1971-81 to 3.45% in 1981-1991, and further to 2.39% in 1991-2001.\nThe population in 2005 has been estimated at around 14.69 lakhs. The population projection for 2011 is estimated around 17.54 lakhs and is based on the hypothesis that the city would grow at a constant rate due to the increasing urbanisation in the state. The trend also shows that the population would increase at a stabilised average annual growth rate of 2.99% from 2005 to 2011.\nThe population density of the city has increased from 9527 per km<sup>2</sup> in 1991 to 12064 per km<sup>2</sup> in 2001. However, this density reduced to 9925 per km<sup>2</sup> due to the addition of new areas (148&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) in 2002. The jurisdiction of Vadodara city has further increased in February 2006 and covers urbanised areas of around 15\u201320&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, on the northern side of the city.\n\na.

The success of the film garnered two direct sequels, ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze]]'' in 1991 and ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III]]'' in 1993. A [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) film titled ''TMNT'' was released in 2007 and built on the success of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series)|2003\u20132009 TV series]]. A fifth film by [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Nickelodeon Movies]] was released on August 8, 2014, and served as a reboot to the original live-action films.
