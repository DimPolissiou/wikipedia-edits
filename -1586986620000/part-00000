Oxyurida is further separated into two superfamilies: Oxyuroidea and Thelastomatoidea, which are parasites of vertebrates and invertebrates respectively.  Oxyuroidea is composed on three families: Pharyngodonidae; parasites of herbivorous vertebrates, and Oxyuridae and Heteroxynematidae; parasites of mammals and some birds.\n\nThe life cycle of ''G. batrachiensis'' is generally simple and direct.  Adult worms live in the posterior gut of the aquatic larval stage, or tadpole, of an [[anuran]] host.  The females of this species produce two types of eggs: thick-shelled eggs and thin-shelled eggs, which are produced in separate uteri.  Eggs deposited by females are passed through the hosts feces into the environment.  Transmission occurs when infective eggs are ingested by another host.  ''G. batrachiensis'' is unique in the sense that it produces two different types of eggs to reproduce and that the parasite occurs only in the tadpole stage of its host.<ref name=\"Adamson2\">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1139/z81-188 | last1 = Adamson | first1 = M. | year = 1981| title = Development and transmission of ''Gyrinicola batrachiensis'' Adamson, 1981 (Pharyngodonidae: Oxyuroidea) | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Zoology | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 1351\u20131367 }}</ref>\n\n<!-- Here is a picture of ''Gyrinicola batrachiensis''\n\n Deleted image removed: [[Image:Fg2.jpg]]\n\nScanning electron micrographs of the bullfrog tadpole gastrointestinal tract.

Females typically produce thick-shelled eggs with a sub-polar [[Operculum (animal)|operculum]]. In some species, including ''Gyrinicola batrachiensis'', eggs are deposited early into development and reach the infective stage only after passing through the feces of the host.  Another hallmark of Oxyurioids is the production of two types of eggs by a didelphic female, a phenomenon known as poecilogony. Accordingly, in some oxyurids there are two types of females (poecilogyny). One female lays un[[embryo]]nated, thick-shelled eggs that are involved in the transmission stage. These eggs then embryonate to third-stage in the environment. The other female produces thin-shelled eggs that contain developed larvae that embryonate ''in utero''. These eggs are used for [[autoinfection]]. In ''G. batrachiensis'', female worms tend to be didelphic, possessing a reproductive tract with two separate branches to allow for the production of each kind of egg. The thick-shelled eggs will come out of the [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] horn of the [[uterus]], and the thin-shelled ones will come out from the [[ventral]] horn.<ref name=\"AndersonPaper\">{{cite journal | doi=10.2307/3282477 | last1=Anderson | first1=R.

''Nematode Parasites of Vertebrates: Their Development and Transmission''. 2nd Edition. CABI Publishing. New York, NY, 2000. Pgs. 232-234</ref>  The production of two different kinds of eggs gives ''G. batrachiensis'' an advantage when it comes to colonization. As already explained, the hard-shelled eggs are passed out in the feces and allow for the colonization of other hosts. The thin-shelled eggs then embryonate in the original host in order to preserve the colonization of that host. In this manner, ''G. batrachiensis'' manages to both spread its presence in an environment and maintain all of its colonies.\n\nThis remarkably clever parasite has other reproductive adaptations that help it colonize. [[Haplodiploidy]], in which unfertilized eggs give rise to males and fertilized eggs give rise to females, is also found in the order. This allows a single female to successfully colonize a host by [[Parthenogenesis|parthenogenetically]] producing sons, which she can then mate with to produce more offspring.<ref name=\"AndersonBook\"/>  Also, one alternative to the haplodiploidy method of reproduction exhibited by these nematodes is reproduction by [[apomictic]] [[thelytoky]]. By this method, adult females parthogenetically create female offspring, and males do not exist. By this manner, female nematodes are monodelphic. In this state, which is typically uncommon among ''G. batrachiensis'', they possess a single uterus that produces thick-shelled environmentally resistant eggs that are then shed from the host. This method of reproduction occurs only in some hosts, such as ''[[American toad|Anaxyrus (=Bufo) americanus]]''. It is assumed that the dramatic difference in each reproductive strategy may be an adaptive response to the life cycles of different host species as well as geographical location.<ref name=\"Pryor\">{{cite journal | last1 = Pryor | pmid = 16013051 | first1 = GS | last2 = Bjorndal | first2 = KA | title = Effects of the nematode ''Gyrinicola batrachiensis'' on development, gut morphology, and fermentation in bullfrog tadpoles (''Rana catesbeiana''): a novel mutualism | url = http://accstr.ufl.edu/publications/Pryor&Bjorndal_JEZ2005.pdf | year = 2005 | pages = 704\u201312 | issue = 8 | volume = 303 | journal = Journal of Experimental Zoology | series = Part A, Comparative Experimental Biology | format = PDF | doi = 10.1002/jez.a.192 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110719083025/http://accstr.ufl.edu/publications/Pryor%26Bjorndal_JEZ2005.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-19 }}</ref>\n\nTypically, one type of egg is predominate in an individual female. Additionally, this species utilizes alternation of generations. Those females that are born from thin-shelled eggs produce mostly thick-shelled eggs.  This assures a balance between thick and thin shelled eggs to optimize colonization.<ref name=\"Adamson\"/> Oxyurida, in general, tend to take advantage of the amazing colonizing ability of the females. An individual female can colonize a host if she can last long enough to mate and produce offspring with parthogenetically birthed sons.

After development they are deposited in the tadpole gut and passed through the feces.  These eggs require about a week to reach in the infective stage, and do not hatch until ingested by the host.  It is noted that some eggs of this type remain infective in the environment through winter.  They are also probably involved in the spreading of ''G. batrachiensis'' from one pond to another facilitated by birds such as herons, which feed on tadpoles.  Worms that have developed from the thick-shelled eggs inside the tadpoles are most likely digested by the bird, however intact eggs pass through the intestinal tract, and transmitted to the new environment through the feces.<ref name=\"Adamson2\"/>\n\nThin-shelled eggs, which are autoinfective, hatch and develop into adulthood within the host.  They cannot be found in the feces of tadpoles and survive for a very short period of time outside of the host.<ref name=\"Adamson2\"/>\n\n<!--\nHere are pictures of the development of ''G. batrachiensis'' in thin shelled eggs.-->\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Gbat.jpg]] -->\n<!--\nFigs. 1-5.

Thin-shelled egg containing infective larva.<ref name=\"Adamson2\"/>\n-->\nThrough experimental evidence it has been determined that larvae in infected tadpoles must have developed from autoinfective thin-shelled eggs deposited by the introduced females.<ref name=\"Adamson2\"/>  From this information we can conclude with relative certainty that the ''G. batrachiensis'' production of two types of eggs offers the maximum chance of survival for the species.  Thin-shelled autoinfective eggs ensure that future generations of the nematode will live on within the existing host and its offspring, while thick-shelled eggs released into the environment allow ''G. batrachiensis'' to spread into other habitats to further the propagation of its members.\n\nOther models of autoinfective behavior that simulate the larvae in infective eggs of ''Gyrinicola batrachiensis'' include larvae found free in the uterus of a female oxyuridan recovered from ''Amphisbaena alba'' from Venezuela. It is noteworthy to study the patterns of autoinfection in this parasite in relation to the patterns of autoinfection in ''Gyrinicola batrachiensis'' to serve as a comparison for differences in similarities in the production of two different kinds of eggs in parasites. Usually, members of the order Oxyurida are transmitted by thick-shelled eggs contaminating the host's environment. However, a few types of species from amphibians and lizards are known to produce two types of eggs: a thick shelled variety that must pass to the external environment - in order to complete the life cycle - and a thin-shelled variety that gives rises to an endogenous cycle, autoinfection. One unique aspect in the autoinfection methods of ''Amphisbaena alba'' is as follows:  the developing larvae are not surrounded by an egg shell but lie free in the uterus; the only other Oxyurida in which an egg shell is lacking are those that exhibit autoinfective cycles. Thus far, autoinfection is known in only three oxyuridan genera; species of ''Gyrinicola'' have an autoinfective phase of their life cycle, along with ''Tachygonetria vivpara'' and species of ''Alaeuris''. In all these generas, autoinfective generations alternate with dispersing generations; in ''Gyrinicola batrachiensis'', females produce two eggs. One egg type tends to predominate in a given female and there is an alternation of generations such that females that develop from thin-shelled eggs, whereas those that develop from thick-shelled eggs produce predominantly thin-shelled eggs. However, in ''Amphisbaena alba'', there are two types of females. One type produces thick-shelled eggs that must pass out of the host to continue their development and another type produces thin-shelled autoinfective eggs. Like in species of ''Gyrinicola'', there is an alternation of generations. Thus, in all of the autoinfective oxuridans the basic pattern involves a generation of colonizing females that give rise to a second generation in the same host individual; worms of this second generation produce thick-shelled dispersing eggs.<ref name=\"AndersonPaper2\"/>\n\nThe patterns of autoinfection highlight mother-son mating and the sex ratio. Female biased broods are favored, involving mother-son matings and accessibility to haplodiploids. Colonization is accomplished by immature stages and female bias is favored at low colonization densities by the fact that, unlike isolated males, isolated females are not lost to the gene pool because they can mate with their parthenogenetically produced sons. In the M. Adamson and D. Ludwig model, colonization was found to occur before mating and male progeny have no fitness unless they colonize a host that contains a female. The ability of a female to produce songs with which to mate is potentially central to the colonization process. This conclusion was specifically called to attention through the case of ''G. batrachiensis''. Using, in pinworms, mother-son matings are not expected to occur commonly in this life cycle since a female's progeny must leave the host. However, in ''G. batrachiensis'', a second mode of reproduction has developed that makes mother-son matings possible: the method by which females produce two types of eggs, thin and thick shelled, as explored in detail in the earlier sections of this article. Once again, thin-shelled eggs contain well developed larvae that hatch at deposition and develop in the same host as the mother; thick shelled eggs are deposited in the two to four stage of cleavage and must pass to the external environment before they are infective. The colonizing period in ''G. batrachiensis'' lasts about three months. During a three-year study, the number of adult worms in hosts in late fall varied between 3 and 12. If colonization is assumed to be a random process, then the mean interval between colonizations varied between 9 and 35 days with a mean of 17, which corresponds to the period a female requires to reach reproductive age. Hence, early colonists may often reach reproductive maturity in isolation from others of the opposite sex even though, by the end of the colonization period, hosts typically contain a dozen worms. Males mature about twice as fast as females, and this lessens the delay in reproduction associated with mating with a son. Brood sex ratio is skewed in ''G. batrachiensis''. In a sample of 234 females, 205 of 296 embryos in thick-shelled eggs were diploid and would develop as females.<ref name=\"Adamson\" />\n\n==Hosts==\n\n''G. batrachiensis'' is a nematode that is a parasite of the gastrointestinal tract of herbivorous [[anuran]] species, specifically in posterior end of the small intestine and in the large intestine of the tadpole stage.<ref name=\"AndersonBook\"/> It is not seen in late-stage, metamorphosing tadpoles or in adult, carnivorous frogs. It is known to occur in 8 anuran species: ''Bufo americanus'', ''Hyla versicolar'', ''Pseudacris triserata'', ''Rana aura'', ''R. catesbeina'', ''R. clamitans'', ''R. pipiens'', and ''R. sylvatica''. These hosts have been found in Eastern Canadian provinces, as well as California, Ohio, and Michigan in the United States. '' G. batrachiensis'' is of special, also, in that it is quite rare for ''Oxyurida'' to be found in aquatic hosts, so rare that only 3 such species exist. This is so because monoxeny is not a successful way of life in aquatic hosts.<ref name=\"AndersonPaper\"/>\n\nRecent studies have shown that ''G. batrachiensis'' has a significant effect on the developmental rates of their tadpole hosts. They have actually been found to accelerate the development and metamorphosis. The study by Pryor and Bjorndal (2005)<ref name=\"Pryor\"/> found that the mean time to metamorphosis was 16 days shorter and that the range of times taken to reach metamorphosis was significantly narrower in tadpoles infected with these nematodes than the time taken in uninfected tadpoles. Some of the proposed manners by which this phenomenon may be explained are:\n* An increase in the colonic width resulting from infection may allow for increased food intake, as well as longer retention of digested material in the fermentation region. Both of these could independently result in a higher energy gain, which could be directed towards the host's development.\n* Altered fermentation due to infection results in higher rates of fermentation, providing higher energetic contributions to the host.

Oxyurida is further separated into two superfamilies: Oxyuroidea and Thelastomatoidea, which are parasites of vertebrates and invertebrates respectively.  Oxyuroidea is composed on three families: Pharyngodonidae; parasites of herbivorous vertebrates, and Oxyuridae and Heteroxynematidae; parasites of mammals and some birds.\n\nThe life cycle of ''G. batrachiensis'' is generally simple and direct.  Adult worms live in the posterior gut of the aquatic larval stage, or tadpole, of an [[anuran]] host.  The females of this species produce two types of eggs: thick-shelled eggs and thin-shelled eggs, which are produced in separate uteri.  Eggs deposited by females are passed through the hosts feces into the environment.  Transmission occurs when infective eggs are ingested by another host.  ''G. batrachiensis'' is unique in the sense that it produces two different types of eggs to reproduce and that the parasite occurs only in the tadpole stage of its host.<ref name=\"Adamson2\">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1139/z81-188 | last1 = Adamson | first1 = M. | year = 1981| title = Development and transmission of ''Gyrinicola batrachiensis'' Adamson, 1981 (Pharyngodonidae: Oxyuroidea) | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Zoology | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 1351\u20131367 }}</ref>\n\n<!-- Here is a picture of ''Gyrinicola batrachiensis''\n\n Deleted image removed: [[Image:Fg2.jpg]]\n\nScanning electron micrographs of the bullfrog tadpole gastrointestinal tract.

Females typically produce thick-shelled eggs with a sub-polar [[Operculum (animal)|operculum]]. In some species, including ''Gyrinicola batrachiensis'', eggs are deposited early into development and reach the infective stage only after passing through the feces of the host.  Another hallmark of Oxyurioids is the production of two types of eggs by a didelphic female, a phenomenon known as poecilogony. Accordingly, in some oxyurids there are two types of females (poecilogyny). One female lays un[[embryo]]nated, thick-shelled eggs that are involved in the transmission stage. These eggs then embryonate to third-stage in the environment. The other female produces thin-shelled eggs that contain developed larvae that embryonate ''in utero''. These eggs are used for [[autoinfection]]. In ''G. batrachiensis'', female worms tend to be didelphic, possessing a reproductive tract with two separate branches to allow for the production of each kind of egg. The thick-shelled eggs will come out of the [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] horn of the [[uterus]], and the thin-shelled ones will come out from the [[ventral]] horn.<ref name=\"AndersonPaper\">{{cite journal | doi=10.2307/3282477 | last1=Anderson | first1=R.

''Nematode Parasites of Vertebrates: Their Development and Transmission''. 2nd Edition. CABI Publishing. New York, NY, 2000. Pgs. 232-234</ref>  The production of two different kinds of eggs gives ''G. batrachiensis'' an advantage when it comes to colonization. As already explained, the hard-shelled eggs are passed out in the feces and allow for the colonization of other hosts. The thin-shelled eggs then embryonate in the original host in order to preserve the colonization of that host. In this manner, ''G. batrachiensis'' manages to both spread its presence in an environment and maintain all of its colonies.\n\nThis remarkably clever parasite has other reproductive adaptations that help it colonize. [[Haplodiploidy]], in which unfertilized eggs give rise to males and fertilized eggs give rise to females, is also found in the order. This allows a single female to successfully colonize a host by [[Parthenogenesis|parthenogenetically]] producing sons, which she can then mate with to produce more offspring.<ref name=\"AndersonBook\"/>  Also, one alternative to the haplodiploidy method of reproduction exhibited by these nematodes is reproduction by [[apomictic]] [[thelytoky]]. By this method, adult females parthogenetically create female offspring, and males do not exist. By this manner, female nematodes are monodelphic. In this state, which is typically uncommon among ''G. batrachiensis'', they possess a single uterus that produces thick-shelled environmentally resistant eggs that are then shed from the host. This method of reproduction occurs only in some hosts, such as ''[[American toad|Anaxyrus (=Bufo) americanus]]''. It is assumed that the dramatic difference in each reproductive strategy may be an adaptive response to the life cycles of different host species as well as geographical location.<ref name=\"Pryor\">{{cite journal | last1 = Pryor | pmid = 16013051 | first1 = GS | last2 = Bjorndal | first2 = KA | title = Effects of the nematode ''Gyrinicola batrachiensis'' on development, gut morphology, and fermentation in bullfrog tadpoles (''Rana catesbeiana''): a novel mutualism | url = http://accstr.ufl.edu/publications/Pryor&Bjorndal_JEZ2005.pdf | year = 2005 | pages = 704\u201312 | issue = 8 | volume = 303 | journal = Journal of Experimental Zoology | series = Part A, Comparative Experimental Biology | format = PDF | doi = 10.1002/jez.a.192 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110719083025/http://accstr.ufl.edu/publications/Pryor%26Bjorndal_JEZ2005.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-19 }}</ref>\n\nTypically, one type of egg is predominate in an individual female. Additionally, this species utilizes alternation of generations. Those females that are born from thin-shelled eggs produce mostly thick-shelled eggs.  This assures a balance between thick and thin shelled eggs to optimize colonization.<ref name=\"Adamson\"/> Oxyurida, in general, tend to take advantage of the amazing colonizing ability of the females. An individual female can colonize a host if she can last long enough to mate and produce offspring with parthogenetically birthed sons.

After development they are deposited in the tadpole gut and passed through the feces.  These eggs require about a week to reach in the infective stage, and do not hatch until ingested by the host.  It is noted that some eggs of this type remain infective in the environment through winter.  They are also probably involved in the spreading of ''G. batrachiensis'' from one pond to another facilitated by birds such as herons, which feed on tadpoles.  Worms that have developed from the thick-shelled eggs inside the tadpoles are most likely digested by the bird, however intact eggs pass through the intestinal tract, and transmitted to the new environment through the feces.<ref name=\"Adamson2\"/>\n\nThin-shelled eggs, which are autoinfective, hatch and develop into adulthood within the host.  They cannot be found in the feces of tadpoles and survive for a very short period of time outside of the host.<ref name=\"Adamson2\"/>\n\n<!--\nHere are pictures of the development of ''G. batrachiensis'' in thin shelled eggs.-->\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Gbat.jpg]] -->\n<!--\nFigs. 1-5.

Thin-shelled egg containing infective larva.<ref name=\"Adamson2\"/>\n-->\nThrough experimental evidence it has been determined that larvae in infected tadpoles must have developed from autoinfective thin-shelled eggs deposited by the introduced females.<ref name=\"Adamson2\"/>  From this information we can conclude with relative certainty that the ''G. batrachiensis'' production of two types of eggs offers the maximum chance of survival for the species.  Thin-shelled autoinfective eggs ensure that future generations of the nematode will live on within the existing host and its offspring, while thick-shelled eggs released into the environment allow ''G. batrachiensis'' to spread into other habitats to further the propagation of its members.\n\nOther models of autoinfective behavior that simulate the larvae in infective eggs of ''Gyrinicola batrachiensis'' include larvae found free in the uterus of a female oxyuridan recovered from ''Amphisbaena alba'' from Venezuela. It is noteworthy to study the patterns of autoinfection in this parasite in relation to the patterns of autoinfection in ''Gyrinicola batrachiensis'' to serve as a comparison for differences in similarities in the production of two different kinds of eggs in parasites. Usually, members of the order Oxyurida are transmitted by thick-shelled eggs contaminating the host's environment. However, a few types of species from amphibians and lizards are known to produce two types of eggs: a thick shelled variety that must pass to the external environment - in order to complete the life cycle - and a thin-shelled variety that gives rises to an endogenous cycle, autoinfection. One unique aspect in the autoinfection methods of ''Amphisbaena alba'' is as follows:  the developing larvae are not surrounded by an egg shell but lie free in the uterus; the only other Oxyurida in which an egg shell is lacking are those that exhibit autoinfective cycles. Thus far, autoinfection is known in only three oxyuridan genera; species of ''Gyrinicola'' have an autoinfective phase of their life cycle, along with ''Tachygonetria vivpara'' and species of ''Alaeuris''. In all these generas, autoinfective generations alternate with dispersing generations; in ''Gyrinicola batrachiensis'', females produce two eggs. One egg type tends to predominate in a given female and there is an alternation of generations such that females that develop from thin-shelled eggs, whereas those that develop from thick-shelled eggs produce predominantly thin-shelled eggs. However, in ''Amphisbaena alba'', there are two types of females. One type produces thick-shelled eggs that must pass out of the host to continue their development and another type produces thin-shelled autoinfective eggs. Like in species of ''Gyrinicola'', there is an alternation of generations. Thus, in all of the autoinfective oxuridans the basic pattern involves a generation of colonizing females that give rise to a second generation in the same host individual; worms of this second generation produce thick-shelled dispersing eggs.<ref name=\"AndersonPaper2\"/>\n\nThe patterns of autoinfection highlight mother-son mating and the sex ratio. Female biased broods are favored, involving mother-son matings and accessibility to haplodiploids. Colonization is accomplished by immature stages and female bias is favored at low colonization densities by the fact that, unlike isolated males, isolated females are not lost to the gene pool because they can mate with their parthenogenetically produced sons. In the M. Adamson and D. Ludwig model, colonization was found to occur before mating and male progeny have no fitness unless they colonize a host that contains a female. The ability of a female to produce songs with which to mate is potentially central to the colonization process. This conclusion was specifically called to attention through the case of ''G. batrachiensis''. Using, in pinworms, mother-son matings are not expected to occur commonly in this life cycle since a female's progeny must leave the host. However, in ''G. batrachiensis'', a second mode of reproduction has developed that makes mother-son matings possible: the method by which females produce two types of eggs, thin and thick shelled, as explored in detail in the earlier sections of this article. Once again, thin-shelled eggs contain well developed larvae that hatch at deposition and develop in the same host as the mother; thick shelled eggs are deposited in the two to four stage of cleavage and must pass to the external environment before they are infective. The colonizing period in ''G. batrachiensis'' lasts about three months. During a three-year study, the number of adult worms in hosts in late fall varied between 3 and 12. If colonization is assumed to be a random process, then the mean interval between colonizations varied between 9 and 35 days with a mean of 17, which corresponds to the period a female requires to reach reproductive age. Hence, early colonists may often reach reproductive maturity in isolation from others of the opposite sex even though, by the end of the colonization period, hosts typically contain a dozen worms. Males mature about twice as fast as females, and this lessens the delay in reproduction associated with mating with a son. Brood sex ratio is skewed in ''G. batrachiensis''. In a sample of 234 females, 205 of 296 embryos in thick-shelled eggs were diploid and would develop as females.<ref name=\"Adamson\" />\n\n==Hosts==\n\n''G. batrachiensis'' is a nematode that is a parasite of the gastrointestinal tract of herbivorous [[anuran]] species, specifically in posterior end of the small intestine and in the large intestine of the tadpole stage.<ref name=\"AndersonBook\"/> It is not seen in late-stage, metamorphosing tadpoles or in adult, carnivorous frogs. It is known to occur in 8 anuran species: ''Bufo americanus'', ''Hyla versicolar'', ''Pseudacris triserata'', ''Rana aura'', ''R. catesbeina'', ''R. clamitans'', ''R. pipiens'', and ''R. sylvatica''. These hosts have been found in Eastern Canadian provinces, as well as California, Ohio, and Michigan in the United States. '' G. batrachiensis'' is of special, also, in that it is quite rare for ''Oxyurida'' to be found in aquatic hosts, so rare that only 3 such species exist. This is so because monoxeny is not a successful way of life in aquatic hosts.<ref name=\"AndersonPaper\"/>\n\nRecent studies have shown that ''G. batrachiensis'' has a significant effect on the developmental rates of their tadpole hosts. They have actually been found to accelerate the development and metamorphosis. The study by Pryor and Bjorndal (2005)<ref name=\"Pryor\"/> found that the mean time to metamorphosis was 16 days shorter and that the range of times taken to reach metamorphosis was significantly narrower in tadpoles infected with these nematodes than the time taken in uninfected tadpoles. Some of the proposed manners by which this phenomenon may be explained are:\n* An increase in the colonic width resulting from infection may allow for increased food intake, as well as longer retention of digested material in the fermentation region. Both of these could independently result in a higher energy gain, which could be directed towards the host's development.\n* Altered fermentation due to infection results in higher rates of fermentation, providing higher energetic contributions to the host. Additionally, an increased production of propionate, relative to acetate, is also energetically advantageous to the tadpole host, again allowing the host to focus this additional energy towards development.<ref name=\"Pryor\"/>\nHowever, at the time of metamorphosis, infected bullfrogs had the same body size and appearance as uninfected bullfrogs, suggesting that the parasite has little impact on the physical morphology of its host (other than the shortening of development time).<ref name=\"Pryor\"/>\n\n== Interesting facts ==\n\n* ''G. batrachiensis'' is actually representative of 4 different species, differing only in their geographic distribution: ''G. batrachiensis'' in North America, ''G. chabaudi'' in South America, ''G. tba'' in Europe, and ''G. japonica'' in Japan.<ref name=\"Pryor\"/>\n*Male species are smaller than their female counterparts.

Phasor notation can only represent systems with one frequency, such as a linear system stimulated by a sinusoid.\n\n=== Addition ===\n[[File:sumafasores.gif|thumb|right|The sum of phasors as addition of rotating vectors]]The sum of multiple phasors produces another phasor. That is because the sum of sinusoids with the same frequency is also a sinusoid with that frequency:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nA_1 \\cos(\\omega t + \\theta_1) + A_2 \\cos(\\omega t + \\theta_2)\n&= \\operatorname{Re} \\{A_1 e^{i\\theta_1}e^{i\\omega t}\\} + \\operatorname{Re} \\{A_2 e^{i\\theta_2}e^{i\\omega t}\\} \\\\[8pt]\n&= \\operatorname{Re} \\{A_1 e^{i\\theta_1}e^{i\\omega t} + A_2 e^{i\\theta_2}e^{i\\omega t}\\} \\\\[8pt]\n&= \\operatorname{Re} \\{(A_1 e^{i\\theta_1} + A_2 e^{i\\theta_2})e^{i\\omega t}\\} \\\\[8pt]\n&= \\operatorname{Re} \\{(A_3 e^{i\\theta_3})e^{i\\omega t}\\} \\\\[8pt]\n&= A_3 \\cos(\\omega t + \\theta_3),\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nwhere\n:<math>\nA_3^2 = (A_1 \\cos\\theta_1 + A_2 \\cos \\theta_2)^2 + (A_1 \\sin\\theta_1 + A_2 \\sin\\theta_2)^2,\n</math>\n:and, if we take <math>\\theta_3 \\in [-\\tfrac{\\pi}{2}; \\tfrac{3\\pi}{2}]</math>, then :\n:* if <math>A_1 \\cos\\theta_1 + A_2 \\cos\\theta_2 = 0</math>, then <math>\\theta_3 = \\sgn(A_1 \\sin(\\theta_1)  + A_2 \\sin(\\theta_2)) * \\frac{\\pi}{2}</math>, with <math>\\sgn</math> the [[sign function]];\n:* if <math>A_1 \\cos\\theta_1 + A_2 \\cos\\theta_2 > 0</math>, then <math>\n\\theta_3 = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{A_1 \\sin\\theta_1 + A_2 \\sin\\theta_2}{A_1 \\cos\\theta_1 + A_2 \\cos\\theta_2}\\right) \n</math>;\n:* if <math>A_1 \\cos\\theta_1 + A_2 \\cos\\theta_2 < 0</math>, then <math>\n\\theta_3 = \\pi + \\arctan\\left(\\frac{A_1 \\sin\\theta_1 + A_2 \\sin\\theta_2}{A_1 \\cos\\theta_1 + A_2 \\cos\\theta_2}\\right) \n</math>.\n\nor, via the [[law of cosines]] on the [[complex plane]] (or the [[Trigonometric identity#Angle sum and difference identities|trigonometric identity for angle differences]]):\n:<math>\nA_3^2 = A_1^2 + A_2^2 - 2 A_1 A_2 \\cos(180^\\circ - \\Delta\\theta)\n      = A_1^2 + A_2^2 + 2 A_1 A_2 \\cos(\\Delta\\theta),\n</math>\nwhere <math>\\Delta\\theta = \\theta_1 - \\theta_2</math>.\n\nA key point is that ''A''<sub>3</sub> and ''\u03b8''<sub>3</sub> do not depend on ''\u03c9'' or ''t'', which is what makes phasor notation possible. The time and frequency dependence can be suppressed and re-inserted into the outcome as long as the only operations used in between are ones that produce another phasor. In [[angle notation]], the operation shown above is written\n:<math>A_1 \\angle \\theta_1 + A_2 \\angle \\theta_2 = A_3 \\angle \\theta_3. \\, </math>\n\nAnother way to view addition is that two '''vectors''' with coordinates {{nowrap|[&nbsp;''A''<sub>1</sub> cos(''\u03c9t'' + ''\u03b8''<sub>1</sub>), ''A''<sub>1</sub> sin(''\u03c9t'' + ''\u03b8''<sub>1</sub>)&nbsp;]}} and {{nowrap|[&nbsp;''A''<sub>2</sub> cos(''\u03c9t'' + ''\u03b8''<sub>2</sub>), ''A''<sub>2</sub> sin(''\u03c9t'' + ''\u03b8''<sub>2</sub>)&nbsp;]}} are [[vector (geometric)#Vector addition and subtraction|added vectorially]] to produce a resultant vector with coordinates {{nowrap|[&nbsp;''A''<sub>3</sub> cos(''\u03c9t'' + ''\u03b8''<sub>3</sub>), ''A''<sub>3</sub> sin(''\u03c9t'' + ''\u03b8''<sub>3</sub>)&nbsp;]}}. (see animation)\n\n[[Image:destructive interference.png|thumb|right|Phasor diagram of three waves in perfect destructive interference]]\nIn physics, this sort of addition occurs when sinusoids [[Interference (wave propagation)|interfere]] with each other, constructively or destructively.  The static vector concept provides useful insight into questions like this: \"''What phase difference would be required between three identical sinusoids for perfect cancellation?''\" In this case, simply imagine taking three vectors of equal length and placing them head to tail such that the last head matches up with the first tail.  Clearly, the shape which satisfies these conditions is an equilateral [[triangle]], so the angle between each phasor to the next is 120\u00b0 ({{frac|3{{pi}}|2}}&nbsp;radians), or one third of a wavelength {{frac|{{var|\u03bb}}|3}}. So the phase difference between each wave must also be 120\u00b0, as is the case in [[three-phase power]]\n\nIn other words, what this shows is that\n:<math>\\cos(\\omega t) + \\cos(\\omega t + 2\\pi/3) + \\cos(\\omega t -2\\pi/3) = 0.\\,</math>\n\nIn the example of three waves, the phase difference between the first and the last wave was 240&nbsp;degrees, while for two waves destructive interference happens at 180 degrees. In the limit of many waves, the phasors must form a circle for destructive interference, so that the first phasor is nearly parallel with the last. This means that for many sources, destructive interference happens when the first and last wave differ by 360 degrees, a full wavelength <math>\\lambda</math>. This is why in single slit [[diffraction]], the minima occur when [[light]] from the far edge travels a full wavelength further than the light from the near edge.\n\nAs the single vector rotates in an anti-clockwise direction, its tip at point A will rotate one complete revolution of 360\u00b0 or 2{{pi}}&nbsp;radians representing one complete cycle. If the length of its moving tip is transferred at different angular intervals in time to a graph as shown above, a sinusoidal waveform would be drawn starting at the left with zero time. Each position along the horizontal axis indicates the time that has elapsed since zero time, ''t''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0. When the vector is horizontal the tip of the vector represents the angles at 0\u00b0, 180\u00b0, and at 360\u00b0.\n\nLikewise, when the tip of the vector is vertical it represents the positive peak value, (&nbsp;+''A''<sub>max</sub>&nbsp;) at 90\u00b0 or {{frac|{{pi}}|2}} and the negative peak value, (&nbsp;&minus;''A''<sub>max</sub>&nbsp;) at 270\u00b0 or {{frac|3{{pi}}|2}}. Then the time axis of the waveform represents the angle either in degrees or radians through which the phasor has moved. So we can say that a phasor represent a scaled voltage or current value of a rotating vector which is \u201cfrozen\u201d at some point in time, (&nbsp;''t''&nbsp;) and in our example above, this is at an angle of 30\u00b0.\n\nSometimes when we are analysing alternating waveforms we may need to know the position of the phasor, representing the alternating quantity at some particular instant in time especially when we want to compare two different waveforms on the same axis. For example, voltage and current. We have assumed in the waveform above that the waveform starts at time ''t''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 with a corresponding phase angle in either degrees or radians.\n\nBut if a second waveform starts to the left or to the right of this zero point, or if we want to represent in phasor notation the relationship between the two waveforms, then we will need to take into account this phase difference, {{var|\u03a6}} of the waveform. Consider the diagram below from the previous Phase Difference tutorial.\n\n=== Differentiation and integration ===\nThe time derivative or integral of a phasor produces another phasor.{{efn|\nThis results from <math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} t}(e^{i \\omega t}) = i \\omega e^{i \\omega t}</math>,\n\nwhich means that the [[complex exponential]] is the [[eigenfunction]] of the [[derivative]] operation.\n}}  For example:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{Re}\\left\\{\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} t}(A e^{i\\theta} \\cdot e^{i\\omega t})\\right\\}= \\operatorname{Re}\\{A e^{i\\theta} \\cdot i\\omega e^{i\\omega t}\\} = \\operatorname{Re}\\{A e^{i\\theta} \\cdot e^{i\\pi/2} \\omega e^{i\\omega t}\\} = \\operatorname{Re}\\{\\omega A e^{i(\\theta + \\pi/2)} \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\} = \\omega A\\cdot \\cos(\\omega t + \\theta + \\pi/2)\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nTherefore, in phasor representation, the time derivative of a sinusoid becomes just multiplication by the constant <math>i \\omega = (e^{i\\pi/2} \\cdot \\omega)\\,</math>.\n\nSimilarly, integrating a phasor corresponds to multiplication by <math>\\frac{1}{i\\omega} = \\frac{e^{-i\\pi/2}}{\\omega}\\,</math>. The time-dependent factor, <math>e^{i\\omega t}\\,</math>, is unaffected.\n\nWhen we solve a [[linear differential equation]] with phasor arithmetic, we are merely factoring <math>e^{i\\omega t}\\,</math> out of all terms of the equation, and reinserting it into the answer. For example, consider the following differential equation for the voltage across the capacitor in an [[RC circuit]]:\n:<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\ v_C(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{1}{RC}v_C(t) = \\frac{1}{RC}v_S(t)</math>\n\nWhen the voltage source in this circuit is sinusoidal:\n:<math>v_S(t) = V_P\\cdot \\cos(\\omega t + \\theta),\\,</math>\n\nwe may substitute <math>\n\\begin{align}\nv_S(t) &= \\operatorname{Re} \\{V_s \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n:<math>v_C(t) = \\operatorname{Re} \\{V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\},</math>\n\nwhere phasor <math>V_s = V_P e^{i\\theta}\\,</math>, and phasor <math>V_c\\,</math> is the unknown quantity to be determined.\n\nIn the phasor shorthand notation, the differential equation reduces to\n:<math>i \\omega V_c + \\frac{1}{RC} V_c = \\frac{1}{RC}V_s</math>&nbsp;{{efn|\n;Proof:\n{{NumBlk|:|\n<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\ \\operatorname{Re} \\{V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\}}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{1}{RC}\\operatorname{Re} \\{V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\} = \\frac{1}{RC}\\operatorname{Re} \\{V_s \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\}</math>\n|{{EquationRef|Eq.1}}}}\n\nSince this must hold for all <math>t\\,</math>, specifically: <math>t - \\frac{\\pi}{2\\omega }\\,</math>, it follows that\n{{NumBlk|:|\n<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\ \\operatorname{Im} \\{V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\}}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{1}{RC}\\operatorname{Im} \\{V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\} = \\frac{1}{RC}\\operatorname{Im} \\{V_s \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\}</math>\n|{{EquationRef|Eq.2}}}}\n\nIt is also readily seen that\n:<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\ \\operatorname{Re} \\{V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \n= \\operatorname{Re} \\left\\{ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\left( V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\right)}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\right\\}\n= \\operatorname{Re} \\left\\{ i\\omega V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t} \\right\\}</math>\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\ \\operatorname{Im} \\{V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \n= \\operatorname{Im} \\left\\{ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\left( V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\right)}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\right\\}\n= \\operatorname{Im} \\left\\{ i\\omega V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t} \\right\\}</math>\n\n\nSubstituting these into &nbsp;{{EquationNote|Eq.1}} and &nbsp;{{EquationNote|Eq.2}}, multiplying &nbsp;{{EquationNote|Eq.2}} by <math>i,\\,</math>&nbsp; and adding both equations gives\n:<math>i\\omega V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t} + \\frac{1}{RC}V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t} = \\frac{1}{RC}V_s \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}</math>\n\n:<math>\\left(i\\omega V_c + \\frac{1}{RC}V_c \\right) \\cdot e^{i\\omega t} = \\left( \\frac{1}{RC}V_s\\right) \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}</math>\n\n:<math>i\\omega V_c + \\frac{1}{RC}V_c = \\frac{1}{RC}V_s \\quad\\quad(\\mathrm{QED})</math>\n}}\n\nSolving for the phasor capacitor voltage gives\n:<math>\nV_c = \\frac{1}{1 + i \\omega RC} \\cdot (V_s) = \\frac{1-i\\omega R C}{1+(\\omega R C)^2} \\cdot (V_P e^{i\\theta})\\,\n</math>\n\nAs we have seen, the factor multiplying <math>V_s\\,</math> represents differences of the amplitude and phase of <math>v_C(t)\\,</math>&nbsp; relative to <math>V_P\\,</math>&nbsp; and <math>\\theta\\,</math>.\n\nIn polar coordinate form, it is\n:<math>\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + (\\omega RC)^2}}\\cdot e^{-i \\phi(\\omega)},\\text{ where }\\phi(\\omega) = \\arctan(\\omega RC).\\,</math>\n\nTherefore\n:<math>v_C(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + (\\omega RC)^2}}\\cdot V_P \\cos(\\omega t + \\theta- \\phi(\\omega))</math>\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Circuit laws ===\n\nWith phasors, the techniques for solving [[Direct current|DC]] circuits can be applied to solve AC circuits.  A list of the basic laws is given below.\n\n* '''Ohm's law for resistors:''' a resistor has no time delays and therefore doesn't change the phase of a signal therefore ''V''=''IR'' remains valid.\n* '''Ohm's law for resistors, inductors, and capacitors:''' ''V''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''IZ'' where ''Z'' is the complex [[electrical impedance|impedance]]. <!-- we probably want a justification of this somewhere-->\n* In an AC circuit we have real power (''P'') which is a representation of the average power into the circuit and reactive power (''Q'') which indicates power flowing back and forth. We can also define the [[complex power]] ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''P''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''jQ'' and the apparent power which is the magnitude of ''S''. The power law for an AC circuit expressed in phasors is then ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''VI''<sup>*</sup> (where ''I''<sup>*</sup> is the [[complex conjugate]] of ''I'', and the magnitudes of the voltage and current phasors ''V'' and ''I'' are the [[Root mean square#Definition|RMS]] values of the voltage and current, respectively).\n* [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]] work with phasors in complex form\n\nGiven this we can apply the techniques of [[analysis of resistive circuits]] with phasors to analyze single frequency AC circuits containing resistors, capacitors, and inductors. Multiple frequency linear AC circuits and AC circuits with different waveforms can be analyzed to find voltages and currents by transforming all waveforms to sine wave components with magnitude and phase then analyzing each frequency separately, as allowed by the [[superposition theorem]]. This solution method applies only to inputs that are sinusoidal and for solutions that are in steady state, i.e., after all transients have died out.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Introduction to electromagnetic compatibility|last=Clayton|first=Paul|publisher=Wiley|year=2008|isbn=978-81-265-2875-2|location=|pages=861}}</ref>\n\nThe concept is frequently involved in representing an [[electrical impedance]]. In this case, the phase angle is the [[phase difference]] between the voltage applied to the impedance and the current driven through it.\n\n===Power engineering===\nIn analysis of [[three phase]] AC power systems, usually a set of phasors is defined as the three complex cube roots of unity, graphically represented as unit magnitudes at angles of 0, 120 and 240 degrees. By treating polyphase AC circuit quantities as phasors, balanced circuits can be simplified and unbalanced circuits can be treated as an algebraic combination of [[symmetrical components]]. This approach greatly simplifies the work required in electrical calculations of voltage drop, power flow, and short-circuit currents. In the context of power systems analysis, the phase angle is often given in [[Degree (angle)|degree]]s, and the magnitude in [[Root Mean Square|rms]] value rather than the peak amplitude of the sinusoid.\n\nThe technique of [[synchrophasor]]s uses digital instruments to measure the phasors representing transmission system voltages at widespread points in a transmission network.  Differences among the phasors indicate power flow and system stability.\n\n=== Telecommunications: analog modulations ===\n\nThe rotating frame picture using phasor can be a powerful tool to understand analog modulations such as [[amplitude modulation]] (and its variants <ref name=IJRES>de Oliveira, H.M. and Nunes, F.D.

In particular it is ''not'' the shorthand notation for another phasor.  Multiplying a phasor current by an impedance produces a phasor voltage.  But the product of two phasors (or squaring a phasor) would represent the product of two sinusoids, which is a non-linear operation that produces new frequency components. Phasor notation can only represent systems with one frequency, such as a linear system stimulated by a sinusoid.\n\n=== Addition ===\n[[File:sumafasores.gif|thumb|right|The sum of phasors as addition of rotating vectors]]The sum of multiple phasors produces another phasor.

The time and frequency dependence can be suppressed and re-inserted into the outcome as long as the only operations used in between are ones that produce another phasor. In [[angle notation]], the operation shown above is written\n:<math>A_1 \\angle \\theta_1 + A_2 \\angle \\theta_2 = A_3 \\angle \\theta_3. \\, </math>\n\nAnother way to view addition is that two '''vectors''' with coordinates {{nowrap|[&nbsp;''A''<sub>1</sub> cos(''\u03c9t'' + ''\u03b8''<sub>1</sub>), ''A''<sub>1</sub> sin(''\u03c9t'' + ''\u03b8''<sub>1</sub>)&nbsp;]}} and {{nowrap|[&nbsp;''A''<sub>2</sub> cos(''\u03c9t'' + ''\u03b8''<sub>2</sub>), ''A''<sub>2</sub> sin(''\u03c9t'' + ''\u03b8''<sub>2</sub>)&nbsp;]}} are [[vector (geometric)#Vector addition and subtraction|added vectorially]] to produce a resultant vector with coordinates {{nowrap|[&nbsp;''A''<sub>3</sub> cos(''\u03c9t'' + ''\u03b8''<sub>3</sub>), ''A''<sub>3</sub> sin(''\u03c9t'' + ''\u03b8''<sub>3</sub>)&nbsp;]}}. (see animation)\n\n[[Image:destructive interference.png|thumb|right|Phasor diagram of three waves in perfect destructive interference]]\nIn physics, this sort of addition occurs when sinusoids [[Interference (wave propagation)|interfere]] with each other, constructively or destructively.  The static vector concept provides useful insight into questions like this: \"''What phase difference would be required between three identical sinusoids for perfect cancellation?''\" In this case, simply imagine taking three vectors of equal length and placing them head to tail such that the last head matches up with the first tail.  Clearly, the shape which satisfies these conditions is an equilateral [[triangle]], so the angle between each phasor to the next is 120\u00b0 ({{frac|3{{pi}}|2}}&nbsp;radians), or one third of a wavelength {{frac|{{var|\u03bb}}|3}}. So the phase difference between each wave must also be 120\u00b0, as is the case in [[three-phase power]]\n\nIn other words, what this shows is that\n:<math>\\cos(\\omega t) + \\cos(\\omega t + 2\\pi/3) + \\cos(\\omega t -2\\pi/3) = 0.\\,</math>\n\nIn the example of three waves, the phase difference between the first and the last wave was 240&nbsp;degrees, while for two waves destructive interference happens at 180 degrees. In the limit of many waves, the phasors must form a circle for destructive interference, so that the first phasor is nearly parallel with the last. This means that for many sources, destructive interference happens when the first and last wave differ by 360 degrees, a full wavelength <math>\\lambda</math>. This is why in single slit [[diffraction]], the minima occur when [[light]] from the far edge travels a full wavelength further than the light from the near edge.\n\nAs the single vector rotates in an anti-clockwise direction, its tip at point A will rotate one complete revolution of 360\u00b0 or 2{{pi}}&nbsp;radians representing one complete cycle. If the length of its moving tip is transferred at different angular intervals in time to a graph as shown above, a sinusoidal waveform would be drawn starting at the left with zero time. Each position along the horizontal axis indicates the time that has elapsed since zero time, ''t''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0. When the vector is horizontal the tip of the vector represents the angles at 0\u00b0, 180\u00b0, and at 360\u00b0.\n\nLikewise, when the tip of the vector is vertical it represents the positive peak value, (&nbsp;+''A''<sub>max</sub>&nbsp;) at 90\u00b0 or {{frac|{{pi}}|2}} and the negative peak value, (&nbsp;&minus;''A''<sub>max</sub>&nbsp;) at 270\u00b0 or {{frac|3{{pi}}|2}}. Then the time axis of the waveform represents the angle either in degrees or radians through which the phasor has moved. So we can say that a phasor represent a scaled voltage or current value of a rotating vector which is \u201cfrozen\u201d at some point in time, (&nbsp;''t''&nbsp;) and in our example above, this is at an angle of 30\u00b0.\n\nSometimes when we are analysing alternating waveforms we may need to know the position of the phasor, representing the alternating quantity at some particular instant in time especially when we want to compare two different waveforms on the same axis. For example, voltage and current. We have assumed in the waveform above that the waveform starts at time ''t''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 with a corresponding phase angle in either degrees or radians.\n\nBut if a second waveform starts to the left or to the right of this zero point, or if we want to represent in phasor notation the relationship between the two waveforms, then we will need to take into account this phase difference, {{var|\u03a6}} of the waveform. Consider the diagram below from the previous Phase Difference tutorial.\n\n=== Differentiation and integration ===\nThe time derivative or integral of a phasor produces another phasor.{{efn|\nThis results from <math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} t}(e^{i \\omega t}) = i \\omega e^{i \\omega t}</math>,\n\nwhich means that the [[complex exponential]] is the [[eigenfunction]] of the [[derivative]] operation.\n}}  For example:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{Re}\\left\\{\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} t}(A e^{i\\theta} \\cdot e^{i\\omega t})\\right\\}= \\operatorname{Re}\\{A e^{i\\theta} \\cdot i\\omega e^{i\\omega t}\\} = \\operatorname{Re}\\{A e^{i\\theta} \\cdot e^{i\\pi/2} \\omega e^{i\\omega t}\\} = \\operatorname{Re}\\{\\omega A e^{i(\\theta + \\pi/2)} \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\} = \\omega A\\cdot \\cos(\\omega t + \\theta + \\pi/2)\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nTherefore, in phasor representation, the time derivative of a sinusoid becomes just multiplication by the constant <math>i \\omega = (e^{i\\pi/2} \\cdot \\omega)\\,</math>.\n\nSimilarly, integrating a phasor corresponds to multiplication by <math>\\frac{1}{i\\omega} = \\frac{e^{-i\\pi/2}}{\\omega}\\,</math>. The time-dependent factor, <math>e^{i\\omega t}\\,</math>, is unaffected.\n\nWhen we solve a [[linear differential equation]] with phasor arithmetic, we are merely factoring <math>e^{i\\omega t}\\,</math> out of all terms of the equation, and reinserting it into the answer. For example, consider the following differential equation for the voltage across the capacitor in an [[RC circuit]]:\n:<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\ v_C(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{1}{RC}v_C(t) = \\frac{1}{RC}v_S(t)</math>\n\nWhen the voltage source in this circuit is sinusoidal:\n:<math>v_S(t) = V_P\\cdot \\cos(\\omega t + \\theta),\\,</math>\n\nwe may substitute <math>\n\\begin{align}\nv_S(t) &= \\operatorname{Re} \\{V_s \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n:<math>v_C(t) = \\operatorname{Re} \\{V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\},</math>\n\nwhere phasor <math>V_s = V_P e^{i\\theta}\\,</math>, and phasor <math>V_c\\,</math> is the unknown quantity to be determined.\n\nIn the phasor shorthand notation, the differential equation reduces to\n:<math>i \\omega V_c + \\frac{1}{RC} V_c = \\frac{1}{RC}V_s</math>&nbsp;{{efn|\n;Proof:\n{{NumBlk|:|\n<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\ \\operatorname{Re} \\{V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\}}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{1}{RC}\\operatorname{Re} \\{V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\} = \\frac{1}{RC}\\operatorname{Re} \\{V_s \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\}</math>\n|{{EquationRef|Eq.1}}}}\n\nSince this must hold for all <math>t\\,</math>, specifically: <math>t - \\frac{\\pi}{2\\omega }\\,</math>, it follows that\n{{NumBlk|:|\n<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\ \\operatorname{Im} \\{V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\}}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{1}{RC}\\operatorname{Im} \\{V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\} = \\frac{1}{RC}\\operatorname{Im} \\{V_s \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\}</math>\n|{{EquationRef|Eq.2}}}}\n\nIt is also readily seen that\n:<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\ \\operatorname{Re} \\{V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \n= \\operatorname{Re} \\left\\{ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\left( V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\right)}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\right\\}\n= \\operatorname{Re} \\left\\{ i\\omega V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t} \\right\\}</math>\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\ \\operatorname{Im} \\{V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \n= \\operatorname{Im} \\left\\{ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\left( V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\right)}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\right\\}\n= \\operatorname{Im} \\left\\{ i\\omega V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t} \\right\\}</math>\n\n\nSubstituting these into &nbsp;{{EquationNote|Eq.1}} and &nbsp;{{EquationNote|Eq.2}}, multiplying &nbsp;{{EquationNote|Eq.2}} by <math>i,\\,</math>&nbsp; and adding both equations gives\n:<math>i\\omega V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t} + \\frac{1}{RC}V_c \\cdot e^{i\\omega t} = \\frac{1}{RC}V_s \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}</math>\n\n:<math>\\left(i\\omega V_c + \\frac{1}{RC}V_c \\right) \\cdot e^{i\\omega t} = \\left( \\frac{1}{RC}V_s\\right) \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}</math>\n\n:<math>i\\omega V_c + \\frac{1}{RC}V_c = \\frac{1}{RC}V_s \\quad\\quad(\\mathrm{QED})</math>\n}}\n\nSolving for the phasor capacitor voltage gives\n:<math>\nV_c = \\frac{1}{1 + i \\omega RC} \\cdot (V_s) = \\frac{1-i\\omega R C}{1+(\\omega R C)^2} \\cdot (V_P e^{i\\theta})\\,\n</math>\n\nAs we have seen, the factor multiplying <math>V_s\\,</math> represents differences of the amplitude and phase of <math>v_C(t)\\,</math>&nbsp; relative to <math>V_P\\,</math>&nbsp; and <math>\\theta\\,</math>.\n\nIn polar coordinate form, it is\n:<math>\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + (\\omega RC)^2}}\\cdot e^{-i \\phi(\\omega)},\\text{ where }\\phi(\\omega) = \\arctan(\\omega RC).\\,</math>\n\nTherefore\n:<math>v_C(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + (\\omega RC)^2}}\\cdot V_P \\cos(\\omega t + \\theta- \\phi(\\omega))</math>\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Circuit laws ===\n\nWith phasors, the techniques for solving [[Direct current|DC]] circuits can be applied to solve AC circuits.  A list of the basic laws is given below.\n\n* '''Ohm's law for resistors:''' a resistor has no time delays and therefore doesn't change the phase of a signal therefore ''V''=''IR'' remains valid.\n* '''Ohm's law for resistors, inductors, and capacitors:''' ''V''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''IZ'' where ''Z'' is the complex [[electrical impedance|impedance]]. <!-- we probably want a justification of this somewhere-->\n* In an AC circuit we have real power (''P'') which is a representation of the average power into the circuit and reactive power (''Q'') which indicates power flowing back and forth. We can also define the [[complex power]] ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''P''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''jQ'' and the apparent power which is the magnitude of ''S''. The power law for an AC circuit expressed in phasors is then ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''VI''<sup>*</sup> (where ''I''<sup>*</sup> is the [[complex conjugate]] of ''I'', and the magnitudes of the voltage and current phasors ''V'' and ''I'' are the [[Root mean square#Definition|RMS]] values of the voltage and current, respectively).\n* [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]] work with phasors in complex form\n\nGiven this we can apply the techniques of [[analysis of resistive circuits]] with phasors to analyze single frequency AC circuits containing resistors, capacitors, and inductors. Multiple frequency linear AC circuits and AC circuits with different waveforms can be analyzed to find voltages and currents by transforming all waveforms to sine wave components with magnitude and phase then analyzing each frequency separately, as allowed by the [[superposition theorem]]. This solution method applies only to inputs that are sinusoidal and for solutions that are in steady state, i.e., after all transients have died out.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Introduction to electromagnetic compatibility|last=Clayton|first=Paul|publisher=Wiley|year=2008|isbn=978-81-265-2875-2|location=|pages=861}}</ref>\n\nThe concept is frequently involved in representing an [[electrical impedance]]. In this case, the phase angle is the [[phase difference]] between the voltage applied to the impedance and the current driven through it.\n\n===Power engineering===\nIn analysis of [[three phase]] AC power systems, usually a set of phasors is defined as the three complex cube roots of unity, graphically represented as unit magnitudes at angles of 0, 120 and 240 degrees. By treating polyphase AC circuit quantities as phasors, balanced circuits can be simplified and unbalanced circuits can be treated as an algebraic combination of [[symmetrical components]]. This approach greatly simplifies the work required in electrical calculations of voltage drop, power flow, and short-circuit currents. In the context of power systems analysis, the phase angle is often given in [[Degree (angle)|degree]]s, and the magnitude in [[Root Mean Square|rms]] value rather than the peak amplitude of the sinusoid.\n\nThe technique of [[synchrophasor]]s uses digital instruments to measure the phasors representing transmission system voltages at widespread points in a transmission network.  Differences among the phasors indicate power flow and system stability.\n\n=== Telecommunications: analog modulations ===\n\nThe rotating frame picture using phasor can be a powerful tool to understand analog modulations such as [[amplitude modulation]] (and its variants <ref name=IJRES>de Oliveira, H.M. and Nunes, F.D.

In 1862 the [[Hull Corporation]] established a cemetery adjacent, now known as '''Western Cemetery''', and in {{circa|1890}} expanded the cemetery west across Chanterlands Avenue onto an adjacent site.\n\nThe General Cemetery contains several notable monument and burials, including a monument to a [[cholera]] outbreak in 1849, as well as the graves of many notable persons of the [[Victoria era]] and early 20th&nbsp;century of Kingston upon Hull. The General Cemetery closed in 1972, the Western Cemetery is, as of 2018, still in use.\n\nIn 2015 a community group of volunteers, The Friends of Hull General Cemetery, was formed and have taken on the challenge of caring for this heritage site of special natural interest.\u00a0 The group was formed as a subcommittee of the Hull Civic Society. It meets regularly at the Avenues Centre, Park Ave, Hull.  \n\n==History==\n\n===Hull General Cemetery===\n[[File:Entrance to the Spring Bank Cemetery, showing the Botanic Gardens Level Crossing, 1889.jpg|thumb|left|Main cemetery entrance and railway level crossing, view from Spring Bank ({{circa|1889}}, F.S.

He was sold to [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] for \u00a3500,000 in June 2006, and won a place on the [[PFA Team of the Year]] for his performances in the 2006\u201307 season. He then made a \u00a35 million move to [[Premier League]] side [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in July 2007, before returning to Cardiff on a loan deal that was made permanent in July 2009 for \u00a33 million. He again was included in the PFA Team of the Year for the 2009\u201310 campaign, before being sold on to [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] for \u00a31 million in June 2011.

Reserves and Academy|youth system]], he spent six years at the club without managing to secure a regular first team place, instead spending time on loan at [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], and [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]]. He was sold to [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] for \u00a3500,000 in June 2006, and won a place on the [[PFA Team of the Year]] for his performances in the 2006\u201307 season. He then made a \u00a35 million move to [[Premier League]] side [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in July 2007, before returning to Cardiff on a loan deal that was made permanent in July 2009 for \u00a33 million. He again was included in the PFA Team of the Year for the 2009\u201310 campaign, before being sold on to [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] for \u00a31 million in June 2011. He joined [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] on a free transfer in July 2013, before moving to the [[Indian Super League]] with [[Kerala Blasters FC|Kerala Blasters]] for the inaugural 2014 season. Chopra signed for [[Scottish Championship]] club [[Alloa Athletic F.C.|Alloa Athletic]] in March 2015, playing for the side for a year before being released in March 2016. He played the [[Kerala Blasters FC|Kerala Blasters]] in the [[Indian Super League]] in 2016.\n\nHe has represented England at the [[England national under-16 football team|under-16]], [[England national under-17 football team|under-17]], [[England national under-19 football team|under-19]] and [[England national under-20 football team|under-20]] levels. In 2006, he scored what was then the fastest goal by a substitute in Premier League history, scoring after being on the pitch for 15 seconds. With an Indian father, he was also the first [[British Asians in association football|player of Indian parentage to play and score in the Premier League]]. A gambling addiction made him fall in severe debt and he had to seek professional help to overcome his addiction.\n\n==Club career==\n===Newcastle United===\nBorn in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], Tyne and Wear, Chopra attended [[Gosforth Academy|Gosforth High School]] in Newcastle, and owing to his goal-scoring exploits there, and later with the Montagu Boys' Club, was recruited to the [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] academy in July 1993.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Hardy|first=Martin|title=That's what Sunderland think Chopra is worth just a year after Newcastle sold him for only \u00a3500,000|work=Daily Mail |date=12 July 2007|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-467810/3-5m--Thats-Sunderland-think-Chopra-worth-just-year-Newcastle-sold-500-000-.html| accessdate =3 December 2013|location=London}}</ref> Being an unused substitute for Newcastle in a [[Premier League]] match against [[Charlton Athletic]] in October 2002, Chopra signed a three-year contract with the club on 30 October.<ref>{{cite web|title=Magpies tie up Chopra|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/2380733.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=8 June 2015|date=30 October 2002}}</ref>\n\nChopra made his professional debut on 6 November, at [[St James' Park]] against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]].

Each of their parties agreed not to contest seats previously held by the others, and each outgoing MP stood for re-election.\n\n==Other candidates==\nOf the remaining two seats in Northern Ireland, [[Foyle (UK Parliament constituency)|Foyle]] was held by the [[Irish nationalist|Nationalist]] [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP), while [[Belfast West (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast West]] was held by the [[Irish republican|republican]] party [[Sinn F\u00e9in]].  These MPs did not resign and their seats were not contested.\n\nThe SDLP and Sinn F\u00e9in regarded the resignations as a publicity stunt, and were reluctant to take part in the resulting by-elections.  In the event, they contested only the seats which they believed to have an anti-unionist majority.\n\nThe [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland]] instructed its branches to nominate a candidate for each by-election, but many were reluctant, and ultimately, the party stood in only five seats.  The small [[Workers' Party of Ireland|Workers' Party]] also stood, in nine seats.\n\nIn four constituencies, no political party was willing to contest the by-election.  This effectively made these the last uncontested by-elections in British history.  However, to ensure that there was a contest and the Unionists would be able to demonstrate their point, [[Wesley Robert Williamson]] changed his name by [[deed of change of name|deed poll]] to \"Peter Barry\", [[Peter Barry]] being [[Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade|Minister for Foreign Affairs]] of the [[Republic of Ireland]]. \"Peter Barry\" stood in these four constituencies under the label \"For the Anglo-Irish Agreement\", allowing a contest, but did not campaign.\n\nThe unusual circumstances led this to be the greatest number of UK Parliamentary by-elections ever held on a single day.\n\n==Results==\n\n===Aggregate results===\n\nThe aggregated results for all constituencies are shown below. Changes are compared to the aggregate results for the 15 constituencies in the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]].\n\n{{Election summary begin with candidates| title = 1986 Northern Ireland by-elections}}\n{{Election summary party with candidates|\n  |party      = Ulster Unionist Party\n  |government = yes\n  |candidates = 11\n  |seats      = 10\n  |gain       = \n  |loss       = 1\n  |net        = \u22121\n  |votes      = 302,198\n  |votes %    = 51.7\n  |seats %    = 66.7\n  |plus/minus = +13.1\n}}\n{{Election summary party with candidates|\n  |party      = Democratic Unionist Party\n  |candidates = 3\n  |seats      = 3\n  |gain       = \n  |loss       = \n  |net        = 0\n  |votes      = 85,239\n  |votes %    = 14.6\n  |seats %    = 20.0\n  |plus/minus = \u22125.5\n}}\n{{Election summary party with candidates|\n  |party      = Social Democratic and Labour Party\n  |candidates = 4\n  |seats      = 1\n  |gain       = 1\n  |loss       = \n  |net        = +1\n  |votes      = 70,917\n  |votes %    = 12.1\n  |seats %    = 6.7\n  |plus/minus = \u22123.1\n}}\n{{Election summary party with candidates|\n  |party      = Sinn F\u00e9in\n  |candidates = 4\n  |seats      = 0\n  |gain       = \n  |loss       = \n  |net        = 0\n  |votes      = 38,848\n  |votes %    = 6.6\n  |seats %    = \n  |plus/minus = \u22124.7\n}}\n{{Election summary party with candidates|\n  |party      = Alliance Party of Northern Ireland\n  |candidates = 5\n  |seats      = 0\n  |gain       = \n  |loss       = \n  |net        = 0\n  |votes      = 32,095\n  |votes %    = 5.5\n  |seats %    = \n  |plus/minus = \u22123.5\n}}\n{{Election summary party with candidates|\n  |party      = Ulster Popular Unionist Party\n  |candidates = 1\n  |seats      = 1\n  |gain       = \n  |loss       = \n  |net        = 0\n  |votes      = 30,793\n  |votes %    = 5.3\n  |seats %    = 6.7\n  |plus/minus = +1.3\n}}\n{{Election summary party with candidates|\n  |party      = Workers' Party of Ireland\n  |candidates = 9\n  |seats      = 0\n  |gain       = \n  |loss       = \n  |net        = 0\n  |votes      = 18,148\n  |votes %    = 3.1\n  |seats %    = \n  |plus/minus = +1.3\n}}\n{{Election summary with candidates|\n  |party      = For the Anglo-Irish Agreement\n  |candidates = 4\n  |seats      = 0\n  |gain       = \n  |loss       = \n  |net        = 0\n  |votes      = 6,379\n  |votes %    = 1.1\n  |seats %    = \n  |plus/minus = ''N/A''\n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\nAll but one of the Unionists were re-elected, many with extremely large majorities.  The largest of all went to [[Ian Paisley]] in [[North Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)|North Antrim]]. He won 97.4% of the vote, the highest percentage polled by any candidate in a UK by-election since the [[1940 Middleton and Prestwich by-election]].\n\nThe sole exception to this pattern was the [[1986 Newry and Armagh by-election|Newry and Armagh by-election]], where [[Seamus Mallon]] of the SDLP was able to take the seat. Former Cabinet Minister [[Enoch Powell]] was able to narrowly survive a strong challenge from the SDLP in [[South Down (UK Parliament constituency)|South Down]] and was subsequently defeated at the following year's general election.  In the western constituencies of Mid Ulster and Fermanagh and South Tyrone the Unionist candidates were able to survive with less than 50% of the vote due to a split Nationalist vote and both seats were gained by Sinn F\u00e9in in later elections.\n\nThe results of the fifteen by-elections were cited by Unionists as a rejection of the Agreement by the Northern Irish electorate, but did not succeed in repealing it.\n\n===Antrim===\n{{Election box begin | title=[[1986 East Antrim by-election]]<ref name=\"Results\">[http://www.election.demon.co.uk/by1983.html Results of Byelections in the

[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] caused by the resignation in December 1985 of all sitting [[Unionist (Ireland)|Unionist]] [[Members of Parliament]] (MPs). The MPs, from the [[Ulster Unionist Party]], [[Democratic Unionist Party]] and [[Ulster Popular Unionist Party]], did this to highlight their opposition to the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]].  Each of their parties agreed not to contest seats previously held by the others, and each outgoing MP stood for re-election.\n\n==Other candidates==\nOf the remaining two seats in Northern Ireland, [[Foyle (UK Parliament constituency)|Foyle]] was held by the [[Irish nationalist|Nationalist]] [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP), while [[Belfast West (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast West]] was held by the [[Irish republican|republican]] party [[Sinn F\u00e9in]].  These MPs did not resign and their seats were not contested.\n\nThe SDLP and Sinn F\u00e9in regarded the resignations as a publicity stunt, and were reluctant to take part in the resulting by-elections.  In the event, they contested only the seats which they believed to have an anti-unionist majority.\n\nThe [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland]] instructed its branches to nominate a candidate for each by-election, but many were reluctant, and ultimately, the party stood in only five seats.  The small [[Workers' Party of Ireland|Workers' Party]] also stood, in nine seats.\n\nIn four constituencies, no political party was willing to contest the by-election.  This effectively made these the last uncontested by-elections in British history.  However, to ensure that there was a contest and the Unionists would be able to demonstrate their point, [[Wesley Robert Williamson]] changed his name by [[deed of change of name|deed poll]] to \"Peter Barry\", [[Peter Barry]] being [[Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade|Minister for Foreign Affairs]] of the [[Republic of Ireland]]. \"Peter Barry\" stood in these four constituencies under the label \"For the Anglo-Irish Agreement\", allowing a contest, but did not campaign.\n\nThe unusual circumstances led this to be the greatest number of UK Parliamentary by-elections ever held on a single day.\n\n==Results==\n\n===Aggregate results===\n\nThe aggregated results for all constituencies are shown below. Changes are compared to the aggregate results for the 15 constituencies in the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]].\n\n{{Election summary begin with candidates| title = 1986 Northern Ireland by-elections}}\n{{Election summary party with candidates|\n  |party      = Ulster Unionist Party\n  |government = yes\n  |candidates = 11\n  |seats      = 10\n  |gain       = \n  |loss       = 1\n  |net        = \u22121\n  |votes      = 302,198\n  |votes %    = 51.7\n  |seats %    = 66.7\n  |plus/minus = +13.1\n}}\n{{Election summary party with candidates|\n  |party      = Democratic Unionist Party\n  |candidates = 3\n  |seats      = 3\n  |gain       = \n  |loss       = \n  |net        = 0\n  |votes      = 85,239\n  |votes %    = 14.6\n  |seats %    = 20.0\n  |plus/minus = \u22125.5\n}}\n{{Election summary party with candidates|\n  |party      = Social Democratic and Labour Party\n  |candidates = 4\n  |seats      = 1\n  |gain       = 1\n  |loss       = \n  |net        = +1\n  |votes      = 70,917\n  |votes %    = 12.1\n  |seats %    = 6.7\n  |plus/minus = \u22123.1\n}}\n{{Election summary party with candidates|\n  |party      = Sinn F\u00e9in\n  |candidates = 4\n  |seats      = 0\n  |gain       = \n  |loss       = \n  |net        = 0\n  |votes      = 38,848\n  |votes %    = 6.6\n  |seats %    = \n  |plus/minus = \u22124.7\n}}\n{{Election summary party with candidates|\n  |party      = Alliance Party of Northern Ireland\n  |candidates = 5\n  |seats      = 0\n  |gain       = \n  |loss       = \n  |net        = 0\n  |votes      = 32,095\n  |votes %    = 5.5\n  |seats %    = \n  |plus/minus = \u22123.5\n}}\n{{Election summary party with candidates|\n  |party      = Ulster Popular Unionist Party\n  |candidates = 1\n  |seats      = 1\n  |gain       = \n  |loss       = \n  |net        = 0\n  |votes      = 30,793\n  |votes %    = 5.3\n  |seats %    = 6.7\n  |plus/minus = +1.3\n}}\n{{Election summary party with candidates|\n  |party      = Workers' Party of Ireland\n  |candidates = 9\n  |seats      = 0\n  |gain       = \n  |loss       = \n  |net        = 0\n  |votes      = 18,148\n  |votes %    = 3.1\n  |seats %    = \n  |plus/minus = +1.3\n}}\n{{Election summary with candidates|\n  |party      = For the Anglo-Irish Agreement\n  |candidates = 4\n  |seats      = 0\n  |gain       = \n  |loss       = \n  |net        = 0\n  |votes      = 6,379\n  |votes %    = 1.1\n  |seats %    = \n  |plus/minus = ''N/A''\n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\nAll but one of the Unionists were re-elected, many with extremely large majorities.  The largest of all went to [[Ian Paisley]] in [[North Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)|North Antrim]]. He won 97.4% of the vote, the highest percentage polled by any candidate in a UK by-election since the [[1940 Middleton and Prestwich by-election]].\n\nThe sole exception to this pattern was the [[1986 Newry and Armagh by-election|Newry and Armagh by-election]], where [[Seamus Mallon]] of the SDLP was able to take the seat. Former Cabinet Minister [[Enoch Powell]] was able to narrowly survive a strong challenge from the SDLP in [[South Down (UK Parliament constituency)|South Down]] and was subsequently defeated at the following year's general election.  In the western constituencies of Mid Ulster and Fermanagh and South Tyrone the Unionist candidates were able to survive with less than 50% of the vote due to a split Nationalist vote and both seats were gained by Sinn F\u00e9in in later elections.\n\nThe results of the fifteen by-elections were cited by Unionists as a rejection of the Agreement by the Northern Irish electorate, but did not succeed in repealing it.\n\n===Antrim===\n{{Election box begin | title=[[1986 East Antrim by-election]]<ref name=\"Results\">[http://www.election.demon.co.uk/by1983.html Results of Byelections in the
