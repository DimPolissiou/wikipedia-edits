As it does not have any stipulated goals, it is irrelevant to talk about winning or losing in relation to ''Second Life''. Likewise, unlike a traditional talker{{Vague|date=May 2015}}, ''Second Life'' contains an extensive world that can be explored and interacted with, and it can be used purely as a creative tool set if the user so chooses.

A Premium membership (US$11.99 monthly, US$32.97 quarterly, or US$99 annually) extends access to an increased level of technical support, and also pays an automatic stipend of L$300/week into the member's avatar account, and after 45 days that resident will receive a L$700 bonus, making it L$1,000 for that week.  This amount has decreased since the original stipend of L$500, which is still paid to older accounts.  Certain accounts created during an earlier period may receive L$400. This stipend, if changed into USD, means that the actual cost for the benefit of extended tech support for an annual payment of US$72 is only about US$14, depending on the currency exchange rates. However, the vast majority of casual users of ''Second Life'' do not upgrade beyond the free \"basic\" account.\n\nAvatars may take any form users choose (human, animal, vegetable, mineral, or a combination thereof) or residents may choose to resemble themselves as they are in real life.<ref>{{cite web|\nurl=http://www.weburbanist.com/2007/06/17/top-3-look-alike-avatars-and-people-from-second-life-to-real-life/\n|title=Second Life Avatars and their Real Life |publisher=Web Urbanist\n|accessdate = June 18, 2007\n|date=2007-06-17 }}</ref> They may choose even more abstract forms, given that almost every aspect of an avatar is fully customizable. [[Second Life Culture|''Second Life'' Culture]] consists of many activities and behaviors that are also present in real life. A single resident account may have only one avatar at a time, although the appearance of this avatar can change between as many different forms as the Resident wishes. Avatar forms, like almost everything else in Second Life, can be either created by the user, or bought pre-made. A single person may also have multiple accounts, and thus appear to be multiple Residents (a person's multiple accounts are referred to as ''[[Alternate character|alts]]'').\n\nAvatars can travel via walking, running, vehicular access, flying, or teleportation. Because ''Second Life'' is such a vast virtual world, teleportation is used when avatars wish to travel instantly and efficiently. Once they reach their destination, they may travel in more conventional means at various speeds.\n\nAvatars can communicate via local chat, group chat, global instant messaging (known as IM), and voice (public, private and group). Chatting is used for localized public conversations between two or more avatars, and is visible to any avatar within a given distance. IMs are used for private conversations, either between two avatars, or among the members of a group, or even between objects and avatars. Unlike chatting, IM communication does not depend on the participants being within a certain distance of each other. As of version 1.18.1.2 (2007-Aug-02), voice chat, both local and IM, was also available.\nInstant messages may optionally be sent to a Resident's email when the Resident is logged off, although message length is limited to 4096 bytes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LlEmail |title=LlEmail \u2013 Second Life Wiki |publisher=Wiki.secondlife.com |date= |accessdate=October 27, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIdentities in ''Second Life'' can relate to the users' personality or creating their own character.

At the time of this writing, media on a prim(MOAP) is not a reliable enough way of displaying media and such, sites listed work best with Parcel Media or Parcel Audio.\n\n=== Work solutions ===\n''Second Life'' gives companies the option to create virtual workplaces to allow employees to virtually meet, hold events, practice any kind of corporate communications, conduct training sessions in 3D immersive [[virtual learning environment]], simulate business processes, and prototype new products.\n\n== Criticism and controversy ==\n''Second Life'' has seen a number of controversies, as well. Issues range from the technical ([[Real estate (Second Life)#Budgeting of server resources|budgeting of server resources]]), to moral ([[Second Life issues and criticisms#Pornography|pornography]]), to legal ([[Economy of Second Life#Legal position of the Linden Dollar|legal position of the Linden Dollar]], ''[[Bragg v.

Changes to ''Second Life''{{'}}s Terms of Service in this regard have largely had the purpose of bringing activity within ''Second Life'' into compliance with various international laws, even though the person running the business may be in full compliance with the law in their own country.\n\nOn July 26, 2007, Linden Lab announced a ban on in-world gambling due to federal and state regulations on Internet gambling that could affect Linden Lab if it was permitted to continue.

These include increased system latency, and intermittent client crashes. However, some faults are caused by the system's use of an \"asset server\" cluster, on which the actual data governing objects is stored separately from the areas of the world and the avatars that use those objects. The communication between the main servers and the asset cluster appears to constitute a [[bottleneck (engineering)|bottleneck]] which frequently causes problems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.massively.com/2008/01/06/second-life-grid-closed-due-to-asset-problems/ |title=Second Life grid closed due to asset problems \u2013 Massively |publisher=Massively.com |author=Tateru Nino |date= January 6, 2008 <!-- at 10:30 am --> |accessdate=October 27, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.secondlife.com/community/features/blog/2008/03/28/resolved-asset-server-issues |title=RESOLVED&#93; Asset Server Issues \u00ab Official Second Life Blog |publisher=Blog.secondlife.com |date= |accessdate=October 27, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secondlifeinsider.com/2007/06/12/asset-server-issues/ |title=Asset server issues \u2013 Second Life Insider |publisher=Secondlifeinsider.com |author=Eloise PasteurFiled under: LSL, Gridbugs |date= June 12, 2007 |accessdate=October 27, 2008}}</ref> Typically, when asset server downtime is announced, users are advised not to build, manipulate objects, or engage in business, leaving them with little to do but chat and generally reducing confidence in all businesses on the grid.\n\nAnother problem is inventory loss,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://community.secondlife.com/t5/Features/UPDATED-Experiencing-inventory-loss-Read-on/ba-p/573214 |title=UPDATED&#93; Experiencing inventory loss?

Linden Lab offers no compensation for items that are lost in this way, although a policy change instituted in 2008 allows accounts to file support tickets when inventory loss occurs. Many in-world businesses will attempt to compensate for this or restore items, although they are under no obligation to do so and not all are able to do so. A recent change in how the company handles items which have \"lost their parent directory\" means that inventory loss is much less of a problem and resolves faster than in recent years. \"Loss to recovery times\" have gone from months (or never) to hours or a day or two for the majority of users, but inventory loss does still exist.\n\n''Second Life'' functions by streaming all data to the user live over the Internet with minimal local caching of frequently used data. The user is expected to have a minimum of 300kbit/s of Internet bandwidth for basic functionality. Due to the proprietary communications protocols, it is not possible to use a network proxy service to reduce network load when many people are all using the same location, such as when used for group activities in a school or business.\n\n=== Quality assurance ===\nCriticism of [[Software Quality Assurance|quality assurance]] of [[Second Life]] states that [[Linden Lab]] focuses too much on bringing new features to the production environment instead of fixing long-standing bugs that, in the worst case, cause financial loss for the users.

The problem is especially prevalent when large numbers of avatars congregate in one area. The problem is largely due to the fact that the world is entirely user created, and the majority of content created by users is made without any sort of basic graphical optimization. As a result, objects with both unnecessarily high polygon counts, and unnecessarily high resolution textures are prevalent. It is not uncommon for users to have to download and use, upwards of dozens of times, the amount of resources than would actually be required for the equivalent visual result. Certain areas have guidelines for script usage, which helps reduce lag by reducing resources used server-side, but does nothing to alleviate the primary issue above.\n\n=== Congestion ===\nA single region (65536&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> of land hosted on a single [[CPU]]) is set to accommodate a limited number of Residents (40 on 'mainland' regions, up to 100 on private islands),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.secondlife.com/ics/support/KBAnswer.asp?questionID=4010|accessdate=June 24, 2008}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> causing some popular locations such as teleportation points to become inaccessible at times. It is possible for an area of land a Resident has paid for to become inaccessible because another area in the same region has exhausted the avatar limit.\n\n=== Interface ===\nThe control scheme for ''Second Life'' combines controls useful for 3D editing with those useful for game play, which can be highly unintuitive for many. This requires various combinations of [[Alt key|alt]], [[Control key|ctrl]], and the mouse for basic manipulation of the camera and in-world objects. Also, everything in the player's possession\u2014textures, animations, objects, clothing, sounds, videos\u2014shares a common directory tree, and can quickly become cluttered if not carefully managed.\n\n=== Alternative accounts ===\nThe ability for a single real individual to create an unlimited number of accounts for free could have the effect of highly exaggerating the \"residence\" figures. Blogs and forum posts regularly allege exaggerated membership and performance claims.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.secondlife.com/t5/Features/I-ll-See-Your-Million-and-Raise-You-a-Million/ba-p/544153|title=I'll See Your Million\u2026 and Raise You a Million \u00ab Official Second Life Blog|publisher=Blog.secondlife.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203013528/http://community.secondlife.com/t5/Features/I-ll-See-Your-Million-and-Raise-You-a-Million/ba-p/544153|archive-date=2014-02-03|accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://many.corante.com/archives/2006/12/26/lindens_second_life_numbers_and_the_presss_desire_to_believe.php|title=Linden's Second Life numbers and the press's desire to believe|publisher=Corante|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101072536/http://many.corante.com/archives/2006/12/26/lindens_second_life_numbers_and_the_presss_desire_to_believe.php|archive-date=2007-01-01|accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref>\n\n=== Customer security ===\nOn September 8, 2006, Linden Lab released a news bulletin that revealed their ''Second Life'' database had been compromised and customer information, including encrypted passwords and users' real names, had likely been accessed.<ref name=\"lindenblog-urgent-security-announcement\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.secondlife.com/2006/09/08/urgent-security-announcement/|title=Urgent Security Announcement|author=Linden, Robin|date=September 8, 2006|accessdate=2006-11-18}}</ref><ref name=\"secondlifedotcom-security-bulletins\">{{cite web|url=http://secondlife.com/corporate/bulletin.php|title=Second Life Security Bulletin|author=Linden Lab|date=September 8, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025064746/http://secondlife.com/corporate/bulletin.php|archivedate=October 25, 2006|accessdate=2006-11-18}}</ref> However, it was later revealed that the hacker had in fact been focused on trying to cheat the in-world money system<ref name=\"lindenblog-security-breach-update\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.secondlife.com/2006/09/22/security-breach-update/|title=Security breach update|author=Linden, Ian|date=September 22, 2006|accessdate=2006-11-18}}</ref> and their access to personal information was believed incidental, although a full alert was still raised for safety's sake.\n\n=== Fraud and intellectual property protection ===\nAlthough ''Second Life''{{'}}s client and server incorporate [[digital rights management]] technology, the visual data of an object must ultimately be sent to the client in order for it to be drawn; thus unofficial third-party clients can bypass them. One such program, [[CopyBot]], was developed in 2006 as a debugging tool to enable objects to be backed up, but was immediately hijacked for use in copying objects; additionally, programs that generally attack client-side processing of data, such as [[GLIntercept]], can copy certain pieces of data. Such use is prohibited under the ''Second Life'' TOS<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://blog.secondlife.com/2006/11/14/use-of-copybot-and-similar-tools-a-tos-violation/\n|title=Use of CopyBot and Similar Tools a ToS Violation\n|publisher=[[Linden Lab]]\n|date=November 14, 2006\n|accessdate = September 9, 2007\n}}</ref> and could be prosecuted under the [[DMCA]].\n\nLinden Lab may ban a user who is observed using CopyBot or a similar client, but it will not ban a user simply for uploading or even selling copied content; in this case, Linden Lab's enforcement of intellectual property law is limited to that required by the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]], which requires filing a real-life lawsuit.

As a result, many ''Second Life'' businesses and their intellectual property remains effectively unprotected. Another case where settlement and dismissal was gained may be found in the matter of Eros, LLC v. Linden Research, Inc.

In addition, the technical process of removal and re-instatement of content on ''Second Life'' is subject to failure which can result in content becoming unusable to its owner. This does not effectively prevent content theft; a thief who is subject to a DMCA takedown notice will not challenge it, but will simply create a new account and re-upload the content, often releasing it with all permissions available to maximize propagation out of spite.\n\nMost users in the world as paying, private individuals are, likewise, effectively unprotected. Common forms of fraud taking place in-world include bogus investment and pyramid schemes, fake or hacked vendors, and failure to honor land rental agreements.\nA group of virtual landowners online have filed a class action lawsuit against the company, claiming the company broke the law when it rescinded their ownership rights.

This has led to occurrences of low-level fraud within ''Second Life'', in which users swindle other users out of money (via [[Linden dollar]]s which are later traded for real money). Linden Lab will not act on such fraud, and the amounts of money involved are usually small enough (less than US$100) that it is unlikely the victim will wish to spend the money and effort involved in real-life legal proceedings.\n\n=== False DMCA takedown notices ===\nThere have been issues with the use of false DMCA [[takedown notice]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slfreshbakedgoods.blogspot.com/2008/09/sweet-justice.html|title=~*Fresh Baked Goods*~: Sweet Justice...?|date=September 10, 2008|publisher=Slfreshbakedgoods.blogspot.com|accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref> Once a DMCA takedown notice is served, reversing it requires an individual to expose his personal information to the filer (filing a notice does not require this); for the penalty of perjury to be enacted, a lawsuit is required (anything less, the false DMCA claimer can just claim it from a different account every week causing legitimate business unlimited losses).

The fee for 4 OpenSpaces was identical to that for a single private region. However, in March 2008, this rule was modified to permit OpenSpaces to be bought individually and placed elsewhere, as well as increasing the prim load each one could handle. OpenSpaces were made available for a US$415 downpayment plus a US$75 monthly fee.\n\nIn October 2008, Linden Lab announced that the OpenSpaces being used for this purpose were being misused; there was in fact no technical throttle limiting their usage. Linden Lab raised the monthly fee per OpenSpace to US$125, the same cost as half a region; added an avatar limit of 20; and renamed it to Homestead.\n\nA week after the initial announcement Linden Lab stated its intention to add technical limits. A revised Openspace product, with far fewer prims, a no-residency rule, and costing the same monthly amount, was announced.\n\nIn May 2009, Linden Lab announced they were \"grandfathering\" OpenSpace sims (now rebranded as \"Homesteads\"), after a protracted protest movement<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foo.secondlifeherald.com/slh/2008/10/save-our-open-s.html|title=Open Spaces Protest Closes Nautilus Sim! &#124; The Alphaville Herald|date=|publisher=Foo.secondlifeherald.com|accessdate=2014-07-09}}</ref> caused a major amount of negative publicity and funded potential litigation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sl-newspaper-bnc.blogspot.com/2008/11/intlibber-brautigan-on-openspace-policy.html|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ace-exchange.com/symbol/SOS/profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207091918/http://www.ace-exchange.com/symbol/SOS/profile|date=February 7, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.secondlife.com/community/land/blog/2009/05/26/good-news-homestead-pricing-to-be-grandfathered-if-purchased-before-july-1st-2009|title=Land - Second Life|date=|publisher=Blogs.secondlife.com|accessdate=2014-07-09}}</ref>\n\n=== Marketing ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2009}}\nLinden Lab has been accused{{who|date=February 2013}} of manipulation of user count statistics to make the world seem more popular than it is. This includes counting multiple avatars created by the same real person as separate accounts, never removing accounts from the database no matter how long they have been idle, counting accounts which are created for free and which never pay any money into the game equally with those that do, and implementing in-world systems which encourage the creation of bogus extra accounts (for example, \"traffic bots\" which simply remain stationary in a store, causing the system to rank the store as popular because there are people there).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/magazine/15-08/ff_sheep?currentPage=1|title=How Madison Avenue Is Wasting Millions on a Deserted Second Life|author=Frank Rose|date=2007-07-24|accessdate=2009-03-08|publisher=Wired.com}}</ref><ref>Rolph, Shaun. \"[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/02/20/second_life_analysis/ The phony economics of Second Life].\" ''[[The Register]]''.

When a teen turned 18, he/she was transferred from the Teen Grid to the Main Grid. Linden Lab had received controversy for the lack of integration between teens and adults. The teen grid and the adult grid actually were technically parts of one grid called [[Agni]], due to ''Second Life''{{'}}s tradition of naming grids after [[Hindu gods]]. However, teen residents could not access the adult regions, and adult residents could not access the teen regions. Underage users, who were under 18 in real life, were not allowed onto the main grid, and being an underage user there was an offense that could be abuse reported.\n\nOn 19 January 2009, Linden Lab, Philip Linden related (in an interview with Metanomics) an intent to merge the two grids into one.

This included [[Grey goo|Grey Goo]] objects which infinitely reproduce, eventually overwhelming the servers;<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6164806.stm |title='Worm' attacks Second Life world |accessdate=2007-01-23 | work=BBC News | date=2006-11-20}}</ref> ''orbiters'' which throw an avatar so far upwards they cannot get back down in a reasonable timeframe without teleporting; ''cages'' which surround avatars, preventing them from moving, and similar tools. Although combat between users is sanctioned in certain areas of the world, these objects have been used to cause disruption in all areas. Attacks on the grid itself, such as Grey Goo, are strictly forbidden anywhere on the grid. It was possible to perpetrate DoS (Denial of Service) attacks on other users simply by scripting objects that spew screen filling characters from anywhere on the grid to another avatar's location, thereby disabling a clear view to the virtual world. Such attacks were quickly blocked with the use of the \"mute\" tool. Bugs in the client and server software were also exploited by griefers to kick users, crash servers, and revert content; however, such exploits were promptly fixed by Linden Lab. <ref>{{cite web |title=Second Life Bug Tracker |url=https://jira.secondlife.com/browse/STORM-836?filter=-4&jql=ORDER%20BY%20created%20ASC |website=jira.secondlife.com |accessdate=11 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Unauthorized copying of content====\n''Second Life'' features a built-in [[digital rights management]] system that controls the movement of textures, sounds, scripts, and models with the ''Second Life'' servers at Linden Lab. At some point, though, this data must be sent to a user's computer to be displayed or played\u2014an issue fundamental to any system attempting to apply restrictions to digital information.\n\nIn November 2006 controversy arose over a tool called [[CopyBot]], developed as part of [[libsecondlife]] and was intended to allow users to legitimately back up their ''Second Life'' data. For a brief period, an unmodified CopyBot allowed any user to replicate SL items or avatars (although not scripts, which run only on the servers at Linden Lab). Later changes to the SecondLife protocols prevented unmodified copies of CopyBot from working. Nevertheless, the basic issue of users being able to duplicate content that is sent to them remains.\n\nResidents who copy content belonging to other users face being banned from ''Second Life'', but Linden Lab has so far never sued any of these users for copyright infringement; since the resident creators (and not Linden Lab) retain ownership of the rights, it is not clear whether Linden Lab would legally be able to do so. Linden Lab does, however, comply with DMCA [[takedown notice]]s served to them against resident content; serving a DMCA Takedown Notice is the normal procedure recommended by Linden Lab for having copyrighted content illegally resold on ''Second Life''.\n\nAny user who uploads, publishes or submits any content keeps the intellectual property rights of that content, however both Linden Lab and other users gain their own rights from your content. Linden Lab receives a content license from anything a user uploads to the server. Section 7.3 of the ''Second Life'' Terms of Service states; \"you hereby automatically grant Linden Lab a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sub-license able, and transferable licence to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the content solely for the purpose of providing and promoting the service\".\nA user who uploads their content to a public area also gives a content licence to other users as well, which allows other users to replicate and record for use in Machinima (as outlined in section 7.4, Snapshot and Machinima Policy).<ref name=\"Second Life Terms of Service\">{{cite web |url=http://secondlife.com/corporate/tos.php |title=Second Life Terms of Service |accessdate=2007-01-23 | work=Linden Lab | date=2006-11-20}}</ref>\n\nRegardless of what rights and licences are given, Linden Lab takes no responsibility for the outcome of any dispute between users or the server regarding content. Section 10.2 states; \"you release Linden Lab (and its officers, directors, shareholders, agents, subsidiaries, and employees) from claims, demands, losses, liabilities and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any dispute you have or claim to have with one or more users, including whether or not Linden Lab becomes involved in any resolution or attempted resolution of the dispute\". Section 10.3 repeats a similar passage but regarding the responsibility of Linden Lab during any data or technical fault.<ref name=\"Second Life Terms of Service\" />\n\n== International issues ==\n=== Legality ===\n{{OR section|date=June 2017}}\nSecond Life users are expected to obey the laws of their own local countries with regard to their actions in the virtual world; however, a problem can arise in countries which have tough laws regarding material downloaded from the Internet, such as pornography. It is possible, for example, for a US user - even in a non-adult area \u2013 to approach German users and create an object displaying an obscene uploaded image which is illegal under German law but legal under US law. Although the US user has broken the ''Second Life'' terms of services as a result, and faces suspension or banning from ''Second Life'', the German user has broken a real-life sex offense law by downloading the image and faces a far worse penalty. Even if the user is eventually deemed to not be responsible for this download because it was unsolicited, they will still have been investigated for a sex offense. However, no actual prosecutions have resulted from actions of this type so far.\n\n=== Taxation ===\nIn late 2006, Linden Lab announced that, in accordance to sales tax regulations of the [[European Union]] (EU), they are required to charge ''value added tax'' (VAT) to EU residents on all money transactions involving the company. However, Linden Lab waives VAT to users who have a VAT registration ID.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Linden_Lab_Official:Value_Added_Tax_%28VAT%29_Frequently_Asked_Questions|title = Linden Lab Official:Value Added Tax (VAT) Frequently Asked Questions|date = 29 November 2012|accessdate = 3 September 2014|website = Second Life Wiki|publisher = Linden Lab|last = |first = }}</ref> The introduction of VAT caused controversy with EU users, mostly among content creators who protested that the addition of VAT caused a disadvantage in comparison to competitors living outside the EU.\n\n==Litigation==\n===''Bragg v.

Although most users and commentators believed that Bragg would have no chance of winning, a number of legal developments occurred as a result of the case, including a court ruling that parts of the ''Second Life'' Terms of Service were unenforceable, due to being an unconscionable [[contract of adhesion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=14176 |title=Gamasutra - Judge Rules Against Second Life Terms Of Service |publisher=Gamasutra.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref> The case eventually ended with Bragg's virtual land and account being restored to him in a confidential out-of-court settlement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://virtuallyblind.com/2007/10/04/bragg-linden-lab-settlement/ |title=Bragg v.

As it does not have any stipulated goals, it is irrelevant to talk about winning or losing in relation to ''Second Life''. Likewise, unlike a traditional talker{{Vague|date=May 2015}}, ''Second Life'' contains an extensive world that can be explored and interacted with, and it can be used purely as a creative tool set if the user so chooses.

A Premium membership (US$11.99 monthly, US$32.97 quarterly, or US$99 annually) extends access to an increased level of technical support, and also pays an automatic stipend of L$300/week into the member's avatar account, and after 45 days that resident will receive a L$700 bonus, making it L$1,000 for that week.  This amount has decreased since the original stipend of L$500, which is still paid to older accounts.  Certain accounts created during an earlier period may receive L$400. This stipend, if changed into USD, means that the actual cost for the benefit of extended tech support for an annual payment of US$72 is only about US$14, depending on the currency exchange rates. However, the vast majority of casual users of ''Second Life'' do not upgrade beyond the free \"basic\" account.\n\nAvatars may take any form users choose (human, animal, vegetable, mineral, or a combination thereof) or residents may choose to resemble themselves as they are in real life.<ref>{{cite web|\nurl=http://www.weburbanist.com/2007/06/17/top-3-look-alike-avatars-and-people-from-second-life-to-real-life/\n|title=Second Life Avatars and their Real Life |publisher=Web Urbanist\n|accessdate = June 18, 2007\n|date=2007-06-17 }}</ref> They may choose even more abstract forms, given that almost every aspect of an avatar is fully customizable. [[Second Life Culture|''Second Life'' Culture]] consists of many activities and behaviors that are also present in real life. A single resident account may have only one avatar at a time, although the appearance of this avatar can change between as many different forms as the Resident wishes. Avatar forms, like almost everything else in Second Life, can be either created by the user, or bought pre-made. A single person may also have multiple accounts, and thus appear to be multiple Residents (a person's multiple accounts are referred to as ''[[Alternate character|alts]]'').\n\nAvatars can travel via walking, running, vehicular access, flying, or teleportation. Because ''Second Life'' is such a vast virtual world, teleportation is used when avatars wish to travel instantly and efficiently. Once they reach their destination, they may travel in more conventional means at various speeds.\n\nAvatars can communicate via local chat, group chat, global instant messaging (known as IM), and voice (public, private and group). Chatting is used for localized public conversations between two or more avatars, and is visible to any avatar within a given distance. IMs are used for private conversations, either between two avatars, or among the members of a group, or even between objects and avatars. Unlike chatting, IM communication does not depend on the participants being within a certain distance of each other. As of version 1.18.1.2 (2007-Aug-02), voice chat, both local and IM, was also available.\nInstant messages may optionally be sent to a Resident's email when the Resident is logged off, although message length is limited to 4096 bytes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LlEmail |title=LlEmail \u2013 Second Life Wiki |publisher=Wiki.secondlife.com |date= |accessdate=October 27, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIdentities in ''Second Life'' can relate to the users' personality or creating their own character. It is based on their decisions on how to express themselves. Most avatars are human, but they can choose to be vampires or animals.

The complexities of those encounters depend on the engagement levels of the people behind the avatars, whether they are engaging Disassociatively (entertainment only), Immersively (as if the avatar was them), or Augmentatively (meaning they engage for a real-life purpose).<ref>Clift, Pamala, \u2033Virgin\u2032s Handbook on Virtual Relationships\u2033, Chapt.6, 2012 (CreateSpace){{ISBN|1463666993}}</ref>\n\n=== Science ===\n''Second Life'' is used for scientific research, collaboration, and data visualization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journal.chemistrycentral.com/content/3/1/14 |title=Chemistry in Second Life |publisher=Journal.chemistrycentral.com |date= |accessdate=February 19, 2010}}</ref> Examples include SciLands, American Chemical Society's ACS Island, Genome, Virginia Tech's SLATE, and Nature Publishing Group's Elucian Islands Village.\n\n=== Social network ===\n''Second Life'' can be a real-time, immersive social space for people including those with physical or mental disabilities that impair their first lives, who often find comfort and security interacting through anonymous avatars. (Indeed, some academics believe using ''Second Life'' might even help improve motor ability for people with [[Parkinson\u2019s disease]].).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/2013/06/23/second-life-turns-10-what-it-did-wrong-and-why-it-will-have-its-own-second-life/ |title=Second Life turns 10: what it did wrong, and why it may have its own second life \u2014 Tech News and Analysis |publisher=Gigaom.com |date= 2013-06-23|accessdate=2014-08-01}}</ref> An example of how ''Second Life'' has been used by disabled people is [[Wheelies]], the widely publicised disability themed nightclub founded by [[Simon James Stevens|Simon Stevens]].\n\n=== Music streams ===\nShoutCast and Icecast Internet radio stations can be streamed into a land parcel in ''Second Life''. Streaming codecs are currently MP3 as AAC and OGG are not currently supported. There are [https://casthost.net internet radio providers] that offer these services or select from a [http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Music_streams#Second_Life_Musicians list] compiled by Lindal Kidd and is updated whenever by whoever as there's no officiant for it. At the time of this writing, media on a prim(MOAP) is not a reliable enough way of displaying media and such, sites listed work best with Parcel Media or Parcel Audio.\n\n=== Work solutions ===\n''Second Life'' gives companies the option to create virtual workplaces to allow employees to virtually meet, hold events, practice any kind of corporate communications, conduct training sessions in 3D immersive [[virtual learning environment]], simulate business processes, and prototype new products.\n\n== Criticism and controversy ==\n''Second Life'' has seen a number of controversies, as well. Issues range from the technical ([[Real estate (Second Life)#Budgeting of server resources|budgeting of server resources]]), to moral ([[Second Life issues and criticisms#Pornography|pornography]]), to legal ([[Economy of Second Life#Legal position of the Linden Dollar|legal position of the Linden Dollar]], ''[[Bragg v. Linden Lab]]''). Security issues have also been a concern.\n\n=== Regulation ===\nIn the past, large portions of the ''Second Life'' economy consisted of businesses that are regulated or banned. Changes to ''Second Life''{{'}}s Terms of Service in this regard have largely had the purpose of bringing activity within ''Second Life'' into compliance with various international laws, even though the person running the business may be in full compliance with the law in their own country.\n\nOn July 26, 2007, Linden Lab announced a ban on in-world gambling due to federal and state regulations on Internet gambling that could affect Linden Lab if it was permitted to continue. The ban was immediately met with in-world protests.<ref name=\"libsl-sl-gambling-banned\">{{cite web|\nurl=http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=201201441|\ntitle=Gambling Banned in Second Life|\naccessdate = 2007-07-26}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2007, a $750,000 in-world Linden Dollar bank or ponsi scheme called [[Ginko Financial]] collapsed due to a [[bank run]] triggered by Linden Lab's ban on gambling.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ginko Financial's End-Game |url=http://alphavilleherald.com/2007/08/ginko-financial-2.html |website=The Alpha Herald |accessdate=28 November 2019 |date=6 August 2007}}</ref> The aftershocks of this collapse caused severe liquidity problems for other virtual \"Linden Dollar banks\", which critics had long asserted were scams.

These include increased system latency, and intermittent client crashes. However, some faults are caused by the system's use of an \"asset server\" cluster, on which the actual data governing objects is stored separately from the areas of the world and the avatars that use those objects. The communication between the main servers and the asset cluster appears to constitute a [[bottleneck (engineering)|bottleneck]] which frequently causes problems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.massively.com/2008/01/06/second-life-grid-closed-due-to-asset-problems/ |title=Second Life grid closed due to asset problems \u2013 Massively |publisher=Massively.com |author=Tateru Nino |date= January 6, 2008 <!-- at 10:30 am --> |accessdate=October 27, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.secondlife.com/community/features/blog/2008/03/28/resolved-asset-server-issues |title=RESOLVED&#93; Asset Server Issues \u00ab Official Second Life Blog |publisher=Blog.secondlife.com |date= |accessdate=October 27, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secondlifeinsider.com/2007/06/12/asset-server-issues/ |title=Asset server issues \u2013 Second Life Insider |publisher=Secondlifeinsider.com |author=Eloise PasteurFiled under: LSL, Gridbugs |date= June 12, 2007 |accessdate=October 27, 2008}}</ref> Typically, when asset server downtime is announced, users are advised not to build, manipulate objects, or engage in business, leaving them with little to do but chat and generally reducing confidence in all businesses on the grid.\n\nAnother problem is inventory loss,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://community.secondlife.com/t5/Features/UPDATED-Experiencing-inventory-loss-Read-on/ba-p/573214 |title=UPDATED&#93; Experiencing inventory loss?

Linden Lab offers no compensation for items that are lost in this way, although a policy change instituted in 2008 allows accounts to file support tickets when inventory loss occurs. Many in-world businesses will attempt to compensate for this or restore items, although they are under no obligation to do so and not all are able to do so. A recent change in how the company handles items which have \"lost their parent directory\" means that inventory loss is much less of a problem and resolves faster than in recent years. \"Loss to recovery times\" have gone from months (or never) to hours or a day or two for the majority of users, but inventory loss does still exist.\n\n''Second Life'' functions by streaming all data to the user live over the Internet with minimal local caching of frequently used data. The user is expected to have a minimum of 300kbit/s of Internet bandwidth for basic functionality. Due to the proprietary communications protocols, it is not possible to use a network proxy service to reduce network load when many people are all using the same location, such as when used for group activities in a school or business.\n\n=== Quality assurance ===\nCriticism of [[Software Quality Assurance|quality assurance]] of [[Second Life]] states that [[Linden Lab]] focuses too much on bringing new features to the production environment instead of fixing long-standing bugs that, in the worst case, cause financial loss for the users. On April 30, 2007, an open letter signed by over 3,000<ref name=\"secondlife-openletter-signers\">{{cite web|url=http://www.projectopenletter.com/News.aspx|title=Open Letters News, 5/1/2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503011341/http://www.projectopenletter.com/News.aspx|archivedate=May 3, 2007|accessdate=2007-06-15}}</ref> users was sent to Linden Lab to protest the [[Software Quality Assurance|quality assurance]] process of the company.<ref name=\"secondlife-openletter\">{{cite web|url=http://www.projectopenletter.com/|title=Project Open Letter|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602235847/http://projectopenletter.com/|archive-date=2007-06-02|accessdate=2007-06-08}}</ref> Linden Lab has responded to the open letter.<ref name=\"secondlife-openletter-response\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.secondlife.com/2007/04/30/project-open-letter/|title=Response to the Open Letter|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070506125440/http://blog.secondlife.com/2007/04/30/project-open-letter/|archivedate=May 6, 2007|accessdate=2007-06-08}}</ref>\n\n=== Frame rate ===\nComputer hardware and Internet connections capable of smoothly rendering high quality content in other [[MMOG]]s may perform poorly in ''Second Life'', resulting in low [[frame rate]]s and unresponsive controls on even minimal graphical configurations. The problem is especially prevalent when large numbers of avatars congregate in one area. The problem is largely due to the fact that the world is entirely user created, and the majority of content created by users is made without any sort of basic graphical optimization. As a result, objects with both unnecessarily high polygon counts, and unnecessarily high resolution textures are prevalent. It is not uncommon for users to have to download and use, upwards of dozens of times, the amount of resources than would actually be required for the equivalent visual result. Certain areas have guidelines for script usage, which helps reduce lag by reducing resources used server-side, but does nothing to alleviate the primary issue above.\n\n=== Congestion ===\nA single region (65536&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> of land hosted on a single [[CPU]]) is set to accommodate a limited number of Residents (40 on 'mainland' regions, up to 100 on private islands),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.secondlife.com/ics/support/KBAnswer.asp?questionID=4010|accessdate=June 24, 2008}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> causing some popular locations such as teleportation points to become inaccessible at times. It is possible for an area of land a Resident has paid for to become inaccessible because another area in the same region has exhausted the avatar limit.\n\n=== Interface ===\nThe control scheme for ''Second Life'' combines controls useful for 3D editing with those useful for game play, which can be highly unintuitive for many. This requires various combinations of [[Alt key|alt]], [[Control key|ctrl]], and the mouse for basic manipulation of the camera and in-world objects. Also, everything in the player's possession\u2014textures, animations, objects, clothing, sounds, videos\u2014shares a common directory tree, and can quickly become cluttered if not carefully managed.\n\n=== Alternative accounts ===\nThe ability for a single real individual to create an unlimited number of accounts for free could have the effect of highly exaggerating the \"residence\" figures. Blogs and forum posts regularly allege exaggerated membership and performance claims.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.secondlife.com/t5/Features/I-ll-See-Your-Million-and-Raise-You-a-Million/ba-p/544153|title=I'll See Your Million\u2026 and Raise You a Million \u00ab Official Second Life Blog|publisher=Blog.secondlife.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203013528/http://community.secondlife.com/t5/Features/I-ll-See-Your-Million-and-Raise-You-a-Million/ba-p/544153|archive-date=2014-02-03|accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://many.corante.com/archives/2006/12/26/lindens_second_life_numbers_and_the_presss_desire_to_believe.php|title=Linden's Second Life numbers and the press's desire to believe|publisher=Corante|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101072536/http://many.corante.com/archives/2006/12/26/lindens_second_life_numbers_and_the_presss_desire_to_believe.php|archive-date=2007-01-01|accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref>\n\n=== Customer security ===\nOn September 8, 2006, Linden Lab released a news bulletin that revealed their ''Second Life'' database had been compromised and customer information, including encrypted passwords and users' real names, had likely been accessed.<ref name=\"lindenblog-urgent-security-announcement\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.secondlife.com/2006/09/08/urgent-security-announcement/|title=Urgent Security Announcement|author=Linden, Robin|date=September 8, 2006|accessdate=2006-11-18}}</ref><ref name=\"secondlifedotcom-security-bulletins\">{{cite web|url=http://secondlife.com/corporate/bulletin.php|title=Second Life Security Bulletin|author=Linden Lab|date=September 8, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025064746/http://secondlife.com/corporate/bulletin.php|archivedate=October 25, 2006|accessdate=2006-11-18}}</ref> However, it was later revealed that the hacker had in fact been focused on trying to cheat the in-world money system<ref name=\"lindenblog-security-breach-update\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.secondlife.com/2006/09/22/security-breach-update/|title=Security breach update|author=Linden, Ian|date=September 22, 2006|accessdate=2006-11-18}}</ref> and their access to personal information was believed incidental, although a full alert was still raised for safety's sake.\n\n=== Fraud and intellectual property protection ===\nAlthough ''Second Life''{{'}}s client and server incorporate [[digital rights management]] technology, the visual data of an object must ultimately be sent to the client in order for it to be drawn; thus unofficial third-party clients can bypass them. One such program, [[CopyBot]], was developed in 2006 as a debugging tool to enable objects to be backed up, but was immediately hijacked for use in copying objects; additionally, programs that generally attack client-side processing of data, such as [[GLIntercept]], can copy certain pieces of data. Such use is prohibited under the ''Second Life'' TOS<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://blog.secondlife.com/2006/11/14/use-of-copybot-and-similar-tools-a-tos-violation/\n|title=Use of CopyBot and Similar Tools a ToS Violation\n|publisher=[[Linden Lab]]\n|date=November 14, 2006\n|accessdate = September 9, 2007\n}}</ref> and could be prosecuted under the [[DMCA]].\n\nLinden Lab may ban a user who is observed using CopyBot or a similar client, but it will not ban a user simply for uploading or even selling copied content; in this case, Linden Lab's enforcement of intellectual property law is limited to that required by the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]], which requires filing a real-life lawsuit.

As a result, many ''Second Life'' businesses and their intellectual property remains effectively unprotected. Another case where settlement and dismissal was gained may be found in the matter of Eros, LLC v. Linden Research, Inc. As of October 7, 2010, the case was transferred to private mediation and the plaintiffs filed for dismissal of charges on March 15, 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.patentarcade.com/2010/06/case-update-eros-llc-v-linden-research_21.html |title=Eros v.

In addition, the technical process of removal and re-instatement of content on ''Second Life'' is subject to failure which can result in content becoming unusable to its owner. This does not effectively prevent content theft; a thief who is subject to a DMCA takedown notice will not challenge it, but will simply create a new account and re-upload the content, often releasing it with all permissions available to maximize propagation out of spite.\n\nMost users in the world as paying, private individuals are, likewise, effectively unprotected. Common forms of fraud taking place in-world include bogus investment and pyramid schemes, fake or hacked vendors, and failure to honor land rental agreements.\nA group of virtual landowners online have filed a class action lawsuit against the company, claiming the company broke the law when it rescinded their ownership rights. The plaintiffs say a change in the terms of service forced them to either accept new terms that rescinded their virtual property ownership rights, or else be locked out of the site.<ref>{{cite web |title=Class Action Lawsuit Targets Second Life |website= CNET |date=May 3, 2010 |accessdate=May 4, 2010 |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-20004004-36.html}}</ref>\n\n=== The Emerald client and in-world logging scripts ===\nThe Emerald client was developed by a group of users based on Snowglobe, an opensource fork of the Second Life client.

This has led to occurrences of low-level fraud within ''Second Life'', in which users swindle other users out of money (via [[Linden dollar]]s which are later traded for real money). Linden Lab will not act on such fraud, and the amounts of money involved are usually small enough (less than US$100) that it is unlikely the victim will wish to spend the money and effort involved in real-life legal proceedings.\n\n=== False DMCA takedown notices ===\nThere have been issues with the use of false DMCA [[takedown notice]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slfreshbakedgoods.blogspot.com/2008/09/sweet-justice.html|title=~*Fresh Baked Goods*~: Sweet Justice...?|date=September 10, 2008|publisher=Slfreshbakedgoods.blogspot.com|accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref> Once a DMCA takedown notice is served, reversing it requires an individual to expose his personal information to the filer (filing a notice does not require this); for the penalty of perjury to be enacted, a lawsuit is required (anything less, the false DMCA claimer can just claim it from a different account every week causing legitimate business unlimited losses). In addition, the technical process of removal and re-instatement of content on ''Second Life'' is subject to failure which can result in content becoming unusable to its owner. This does not effectively prevent content theft; a thief who is subject to a DMCA takedown notice will not challenge it, but will simply create a new account and re-upload the content, often releasing it with all permissions available to maximize propagation out of spite.\n\nA group of virtual landowners online have filed a class action lawsuit against the company, claiming the company broke the law when it rescinded their ownership rights. The plaintiffs say a change in the terms of service forced them to either accept new terms that rescinded their virtual property ownership rights, or else be locked out of the site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-20004004-36.html|title=Class Action Lawsuit Targets Second Life|date=3 May 2010|publisher=news.cnet.com|accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Terms of Service changes ===\nLinden Lab typically offer no compensation when a change to the platform or Terms of Service is made, even when it has a serious negative effect on users.

The fee for 4 OpenSpaces was identical to that for a single private region. However, in March 2008, this rule was modified to permit OpenSpaces to be bought individually and placed elsewhere, as well as increasing the prim load each one could handle. OpenSpaces were made available for a US$415 downpayment plus a US$75 monthly fee.\n\nIn October 2008, Linden Lab announced that the OpenSpaces being used for this purpose were being misused; there was in fact no technical throttle limiting their usage. Linden Lab raised the monthly fee per OpenSpace to US$125, the same cost as half a region; added an avatar limit of 20; and renamed it to Homestead.\n\nA week after the initial announcement Linden Lab stated its intention to add technical limits. A revised Openspace product, with far fewer prims, a no-residency rule, and costing the same monthly amount, was announced.\n\nIn May 2009, Linden Lab announced they were \"grandfathering\" OpenSpace sims (now rebranded as \"Homesteads\"), after a protracted protest movement<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foo.secondlifeherald.com/slh/2008/10/save-our-open-s.html|title=Open Spaces Protest Closes Nautilus Sim! &#124; The Alphaville Herald|date=|publisher=Foo.secondlifeherald.com|accessdate=2014-07-09}}</ref> caused a major amount of negative publicity and funded potential litigation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sl-newspaper-bnc.blogspot.com/2008/11/intlibber-brautigan-on-openspace-policy.html|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ace-exchange.com/symbol/SOS/profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207091918/http://www.ace-exchange.com/symbol/SOS/profile|date=February 7, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.secondlife.com/community/land/blog/2009/05/26/good-news-homestead-pricing-to-be-grandfathered-if-purchased-before-july-1st-2009|title=Land - Second Life|date=|publisher=Blogs.secondlife.com|accessdate=2014-07-09}}</ref>\n\n=== Marketing ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2009}}\nLinden Lab has been accused{{who|date=February 2013}} of manipulation of user count statistics to make the world seem more popular than it is. This includes counting multiple avatars created by the same real person as separate accounts, never removing accounts from the database no matter how long they have been idle, counting accounts which are created for free and which never pay any money into the game equally with those that do, and implementing in-world systems which encourage the creation of bogus extra accounts (for example, \"traffic bots\" which simply remain stationary in a store, causing the system to rank the store as popular because there are people there).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/magazine/15-08/ff_sheep?currentPage=1|title=How Madison Avenue Is Wasting Millions on a Deserted Second Life|author=Frank Rose|date=2007-07-24|accessdate=2009-03-08|publisher=Wired.com}}</ref><ref>Rolph, Shaun. \"[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/02/20/second_life_analysis/ The phony economics of Second Life].\" ''[[The Register]]''.

When a teen turned 18, he/she was transferred from the Teen Grid to the Main Grid. Linden Lab had received controversy for the lack of integration between teens and adults. The teen grid and the adult grid actually were technically parts of one grid called [[Agni]], due to ''Second Life''{{'}}s tradition of naming grids after [[Hindu gods]]. However, teen residents could not access the adult regions, and adult residents could not access the teen regions. Underage users, who were under 18 in real life, were not allowed onto the main grid, and being an underage user there was an offense that could be abuse reported.\n\nOn 19 January 2009, Linden Lab, Philip Linden related (in an interview with Metanomics) an intent to merge the two grids into one. This immediately attracted uproar on SL's private forums, largely from residents who feared they would be required to use the unpopular age verification system, and would be permanently under threat of a false sex-related allegation or lawsuit by a teenager or his/her parents.\n\nThe Main and Teen Grids were merged, with the Teen Grid being partially split up by age. Residents aged 13\u201317 are allowed to access General Rated areas only.<ref name=\"lindenlab.com\"/> The Teen Grid continues to exist in its original location on the Agni, but is now accessible by all residents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.secondlife.com/t5/English-Knowledge-Base/Maturity-ratings/ta-p/700119#What_are_maturity_ratings.3F|title=Maturity ratings - Second Life|date=|publisher=Community.secondlife.com|accessdate=2014-07-09}}</ref>\n\n=== Content ===\n==== Sex ====\nIn ''Second Life'', users can do almost anything that they can do in their physical lives.

Although combat between users is sanctioned in certain areas of the world, these objects have been used to cause disruption in all areas. Attacks on the grid itself, such as Grey Goo, are strictly forbidden anywhere on the grid. It was possible to perpetrate DoS (Denial of Service) attacks on other users simply by scripting objects that spew screen filling characters from anywhere on the grid to another avatar's location, thereby disabling a clear view to the virtual world. Such attacks were quickly blocked with the use of the \"mute\" tool. Bugs in the client and server software were also exploited by griefers to kick users, crash servers, and revert content; however, such exploits were promptly fixed by Linden Lab. <ref>{{cite web |title=Second Life Bug Tracker |url=https://jira.secondlife.com/browse/STORM-836?filter=-4&jql=ORDER%20BY%20created%20ASC |website=jira.secondlife.com |accessdate=11 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Unauthorized copying of content====\n''Second Life'' features a built-in [[digital rights management]] system that controls the movement of textures, sounds, scripts, and models with the ''Second Life'' servers at Linden Lab. At some point, though, this data must be sent to a user's computer to be displayed or played\u2014an issue fundamental to any system attempting to apply restrictions to digital information.\n\nIn November 2006 controversy arose over a tool called [[CopyBot]], developed as part of [[libsecondlife]] and was intended to allow users to legitimately back up their ''Second Life'' data. For a brief period, an unmodified CopyBot allowed any user to replicate SL items or avatars (although not scripts, which run only on the servers at Linden Lab). Later changes to the SecondLife protocols prevented unmodified copies of CopyBot from working. Nevertheless, the basic issue of users being able to duplicate content that is sent to them remains.\n\nResidents who copy content belonging to other users face being banned from ''Second Life'', but Linden Lab has so far never sued any of these users for copyright infringement; since the resident creators (and not Linden Lab) retain ownership of the rights, it is not clear whether Linden Lab would legally be able to do so. Linden Lab does, however, comply with DMCA [[takedown notice]]s served to them against resident content; serving a DMCA Takedown Notice is the normal procedure recommended by Linden Lab for having copyrighted content illegally resold on ''Second Life''.\n\nAny user who uploads, publishes or submits any content keeps the intellectual property rights of that content, however both Linden Lab and other users gain their own rights from your content. Linden Lab receives a content license from anything a user uploads to the server. Section 7.3 of the ''Second Life'' Terms of Service states; \"you hereby automatically grant Linden Lab a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sub-license able, and transferable licence to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the content solely for the purpose of providing and promoting the service\".\nA user who uploads their content to a public area also gives a content licence to other users as well, which allows other users to replicate and record for use in Machinima (as outlined in section 7.4, Snapshot and Machinima Policy).<ref name=\"Second Life Terms of Service\">{{cite web |url=http://secondlife.com/corporate/tos.php |title=Second Life Terms of Service |accessdate=2007-01-23 | work=Linden Lab | date=2006-11-20}}</ref>\n\nRegardless of what rights and licences are given, Linden Lab takes no responsibility for the outcome of any dispute between users or the server regarding content. Section 10.2 states; \"you release Linden Lab (and its officers, directors, shareholders, agents, subsidiaries, and employees) from claims, demands, losses, liabilities and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any dispute you have or claim to have with one or more users, including whether or not Linden Lab becomes involved in any resolution or attempted resolution of the dispute\". Section 10.3 repeats a similar passage but regarding the responsibility of Linden Lab during any data or technical fault.<ref name=\"Second Life Terms of Service\" />\n\n== International issues ==\n=== Legality ===\n{{OR section|date=June 2017}}\nSecond Life users are expected to obey the laws of their own local countries with regard to their actions in the virtual world; however, a problem can arise in countries which have tough laws regarding material downloaded from the Internet, such as pornography. It is possible, for example, for a US user - even in a non-adult area \u2013 to approach German users and create an object displaying an obscene uploaded image which is illegal under German law but legal under US law. Although the US user has broken the ''Second Life'' terms of services as a result, and faces suspension or banning from ''Second Life'', the German user has broken a real-life sex offense law by downloading the image and faces a far worse penalty. Even if the user is eventually deemed to not be responsible for this download because it was unsolicited, they will still have been investigated for a sex offense. However, no actual prosecutions have resulted from actions of this type so far.\n\n=== Taxation ===\nIn late 2006, Linden Lab announced that, in accordance to sales tax regulations of the [[European Union]] (EU), they are required to charge ''value added tax'' (VAT) to EU residents on all money transactions involving the company. However, Linden Lab waives VAT to users who have a VAT registration ID.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Linden_Lab_Official:Value_Added_Tax_%28VAT%29_Frequently_Asked_Questions|title = Linden Lab Official:Value Added Tax (VAT) Frequently Asked Questions|date = 29 November 2012|accessdate = 3 September 2014|website = Second Life Wiki|publisher = Linden Lab|last = |first = }}</ref> The introduction of VAT caused controversy with EU users, mostly among content creators who protested that the addition of VAT caused a disadvantage in comparison to competitors living outside the EU.\n\n==Litigation==\n===''Bragg v. Linden Lab''===\n{{Main|Bragg v. Linden Lab}}\nIn 2006, attorney Marc Bragg sued Linden Lab, claiming that it had illegally deprived him of access to his account<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/gaming/virtualworlds/news/2006/05/70909 |title=Second Life Land Deal Goes Sour |publisher=Wired.com |date= 2006-05-18|accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref> after he discovered a loophole in the online land auction system which allowed regions to be purchased at prices below [[reserve price|reserve]]. Although most users and commentators believed that Bragg would have no chance of winning, a number of legal developments occurred as a result of the case, including a court ruling that parts of the ''Second Life'' Terms of Service were unenforceable, due to being an unconscionable [[contract of adhesion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=14176 |title=Gamasutra - Judge Rules Against Second Life Terms Of Service |publisher=Gamasutra.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref> The case eventually ended with Bragg's virtual land and account being restored to him in a confidential out-of-court settlement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://virtuallyblind.com/2007/10/04/bragg-linden-lab-settlement/ |title=Bragg v.

The primary class was those who suffered economic damages to their livelihoods, through loss of their business revenues in SL.

They had an expert at the Kodak Research Laboratory make a modern photographic copy, but it proved extremely difficult to produce an adequate representation of all that could be seen when inspecting the actual plate. Helmut Gernsheim heavily [[Photo manipulation#History|retouched]] one of the copy prints to clean it up and make the scene more comprehensible, and until the late 1970s he allowed only that enhanced version to be published. It became apparent that at some point in time after the copying in 1952, the plate was disfigured and acquired bumps near three of its corners, which caused light to reflect in ways that interfered with the visibility of those areas and of the image as a whole.\n\nDuring the 1950s and early 1960s, the Gernsheims toured the photograph to several exhibitions in continental Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/permanent/firstphotograph/exhibition/#top |title=The Harry Ransom Center: The First Photograph: Exhibition history |access-date=6 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221232214/http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/permanent/firstphotograph/exhibition/#top |archive-date=21 February 2015 |work=[[Harry Ransom Center]] |publisher=[[Utexas]] |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1963, Harry Ransom purchased most of the Gernsheims' photography collection for the [[University of Texas at Austin]].

They had an expert at the Kodak Research Laboratory make a modern photographic copy, but it proved extremely difficult to produce an adequate representation of all that could be seen when inspecting the actual plate. Helmut Gernsheim heavily [[Photo manipulation#History|retouched]] one of the copy prints to clean it up and make the scene more comprehensible, and until the late 1970s he allowed only that enhanced version to be published. It became apparent that at some point in time after the copying in 1952, the plate was disfigured and acquired bumps near three of its corners, which caused light to reflect in ways that interfered with the visibility of those areas and of the image as a whole.\n\nDuring the 1950s and early 1960s, the Gernsheims toured the photograph to several exhibitions in continental Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/permanent/firstphotograph/exhibition/#top |title=The Harry Ransom Center: The First Photograph: Exhibition history |access-date=6 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221232214/http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/permanent/firstphotograph/exhibition/#top |archive-date=21 February 2015 |work=[[Harry Ransom Center]] |publisher=[[Utexas]] |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1963, Harry Ransom purchased most of the Gernsheims' photography collection for the [[University of Texas at Austin]].

Furthermore, Tipu Sultan also requested permission from the Ottomans to contribute to the maintenance of the [[Islam]]ic shrines in [[Mecca]], [[Medina]], [[Najaf]] and [[Karbala]].\n\nHowever, the Ottomans were themselves in crisis and still recuperating from the devastating [[Austro-Turkish War of 1716\u201318|Austro-Ottoman War]] and a new conflict with the [[Russian Empire]] had begun, for which Ottoman Turkey needed British alliance to keep off the Russians, hence it could not risk being hostile to the British in the Indian theatre.\n\nDue to the Ottoman inability to organise a fleet in the Indian Ocean, Tipu Sultan's ambassadors returned home only with gifts from their Ottoman foes.\n\nNevertheless, Tipu Sultan's correspondence with the Ottoman Turkish Empire and particularly its new Sultan [[Selim III]] continued till his final battle in the year 1799.<ref>{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=s04pus5jBNwC&pg=PA11&dq=tipu+sultan+and+ottoman#v=onepage&q=tipu%20sultan%20and%20ottoman&f=false | title = Pan-Islamism: Indian Muslims, the Ottomans and Britain, 1877\u20131924 | isbn = 978-90-04-10632-1 | author1 = \u00d6zcan | first1 = Azmi | year = 1997}}</ref>\n\n; Persia and Oman\n\nLike his father before him, Tipu Sultan maintained friendly relations with [[Mohammad Ali Khan]], ruler of the [[Zand Dynasty]] in [[Persia]].

Kirkpatrick ''Select Letters of Tipu Sultan'', London 1811</ref> and [[Mark Wilks]],<ref>M. Wilks ''Report on the Interior Administration, Resources and Expenditure of the Government of Mysore under the System prescribed by the Order of the Governor-General in Council dated 4 September 1799'', Bangalore 1864, and ''Historical Sketches of the South of India in an Attempt to Trace the History of Mysore'', 2 vols, ed.

A bunch of about 30 letters written in [[Kannada]], which were exchanged between Tipu Sultan's court and the [[Sringeri]] [[Shankaracharya]] were discovered in 1916 by the Director of Archaeology in [[Mysore]].

It was a normal practice for any ruler, Muslim or Hindu, on his accession or on the conquest of new territory.\n\nNoted for his persecution of Christians, historian Thomas Paul notes that Tipu had shifted his hatred for the British to Catholics of Mangalore and other Christian communities of [[South India]].<ref>Thomas, Paul (1954), Christians and Christianity in India and Pakistan: a general survey of the progress of Christianity in India from apostolic times to the present day, Allen & Unwin, p. 235</ref> According to historian Praxy Fernandes, Tipu Sultan was \"an enlightened monarch who followed a secular policy towards his subjects.\"<ref name=\"mehta\"/>\n\n[[C.

There were repeated attempts to capture Kodagu by the sultan and his father [[Hyder Ali]] before him. The primary reason for Sultan's interest in Kodagu was that annexing Kodagu would provide access to Mangalore port. The Kodavas knew their lands and mountains very well which made them excellent at guerrilla warfare. Kodavas were outnumbered 3 to 1 in most of Tippu's attempts to annex Kodagu but they managed to beat back Tippu most of the times by drawing his army towards hilly regions of their land. On few occasions Tippu's army managed to reach Madikeri (Capital of Kodagu) but the Kodavas always ambushed the contingent left behind by Tippu. Kodavas refusal to bow to the sultan was primarily because throughout their history they enjoyed independence, though there were Rajahs ruling over them, governance of the land mainly rested with Kodavas. After capturing Kodagu on another occasion, Tippu proclaimed, \"If you ever dare to ambush my men again, I will honor everyone of you with Islam\", undeterred, the resilient Kodavas ambushed his men yet again and drove them back to Mysore. By now Tippu realised conventional warfare would never yield him Kodagu. He devised a plan to annex Kodagu by offering his friendship. His offer of friendship was welcomed by Kodavas as the battles with the Sultan over the years had cost them dearly. When Kodavas welcomed Sultan to their land in the name of friendship, the Sultan and his men attacked them and took thousands as prisoners. -->\nTipu got Runmust Khan, the ''[[Kurnool|Nawab of Kurnool]]'', to launch a surprise attack upon the [[Kodava people|Kodava]] Hindus who were besieged by the invading Muslim army. 500 were killed and over 40,000 Kodavas fled to the woods and concealed themselves in the mountains.<ref name=\"Prabhu\">{{harvnb|Prabhu|1999|p=223}}</ref> Thousands of Kodavas were seized along with the Raja and held captive at Seringapatam.

For instance, there were a significant number of forced conversions of British captives between 1780 and 1784. Following their disastrous defeat at the 1780 [[Battle of Pollilur]], 7,000 British men along with an unknown number of women were held captive by Tipu in the fortress of Seringapatnam. Of these, over 300 were circumcised and given Muslim names and clothes and several British regimental drummer boys were made to wear ''[[ghagra cholis]]'' and entertain the court as ''nautch'' girls or dancing girls. After the 10-year-long captivity ended, James Scurry, one of those prisoners, recounted that he had forgotten how to sit in a chair and use a knife and fork. His English was broken and stilted, having lost all his vernacular idiom. His skin had darkened to the swarthy complexion of [[negro]]es, and moreover, he had developed an aversion to wearing European clothes.<ref>William Dalrymple ''White Mughals'' (2006) p.28</ref>\n\nDuring the surrender of the Mangalore fort which was delivered in an armistice by the British and their subsequent withdrawal, all the [[Mestizos]] and remaining non-British foreigners were killed, together with 5,600 Mangalorean Catholics. Those condemned by Tipu Sultan for treachery were hanged instantly, the gibbets being weighed down by the number of bodies they carried. The Netravati River was so putrid with the stench of dying bodies, that the local residents were forced to leave their riverside homes.<ref name=\"Lobo2\"/>\n\nThe Archbishop of Goa wrote in 1800, ''\"It is notoriously known in all Asia and all other parts of the globe of the oppression and sufferings experienced by the Christians in the Dominion of the King of Kanara, during the usurpation of that country by Tipu Sultan from an implacable hatred he had against them who professed Christianity.\"''<ref name=\"Lobo2\"/>\n[[File:James Scurry.jpg|thumb|left|The British officer [[James Scurry]], who was detained a prisoner for 10 years by Tipu Sultan along with the Mangalorean Catholics]]\nTipu Sultan's invasion of the Malabar had an adverse impact on the [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani]] community of the Malabar coast. Many churches in the [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] and [[Cochin]] were damaged. The old Syrian Nasrani seminary at Angamaly which had been the center of Catholic religious education for several centuries was razed to the ground by Tipu's soldiers. A lot of centuries old religious manuscripts were lost forever. The church was later relocated to Kottayam where it still exists to this date. The Mor Sabor church at Akaparambu and the Martha Mariam Church attached to the seminary were destroyed as well. Tipu's army set fire to the church at Palayoor and attacked the Ollur Church in 1790. Furthernmore, the Arthat church and the Ambazhakkad seminary was also destroyed. Over the course of this invasion, many Syrian Malabar Nasrani were killed or forcibly converted to Islam. Most of the coconut, arecanut, pepper and cashew plantations held by the Syrian Malabar farmers were also indiscriminately destroyed by the invading army. As a result, when Tipu's army invaded Guruvayur and adjacent areas, the Syrian Christian community fled Calicut and small towns like Arthat to new centres like Kunnamkulam, Chalakudi, Ennakadu, Cheppadu, Kannankode, [[Mavelikkara]], etc. where there were already Christians. They were given refuge by Sakthan Tamburan, the ruler of Cochin and Karthika Thirunal, the ruler of Travancore, who gave them lands, plantations and encouraged their businesses. Colonel Macqulay, the British resident of Travancore also helped them.<ref name= Bernard >K.L.

Local South India coinage had been struck in the area that became [[Mysore]] since ancient times, with the first gold coinage introduced about the 11th century (the elephant [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]]), and other pagodas continuing through the following centuries. These [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]] were always in the South Indian style until the reign of [[Hyder Ali|Haidar Ali]] (1761-1782), who added pagodas with Persian legends, plus a few very rare gold mohurs and silver rupees, always in the name of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Shah Alam II]] plus the Arabic letter \"\u062d\" as the first letter of his name. His successor, Tipu Sultan, continued to issue [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]]<nowiki/>s, mohurs and [[rupee]]s, with legends that were completely new. As for copper, the new large [[paisa]] was commenced by Haidar Ali in AH1195, two years before his death, with the elephant on the obverse, the mint on the reverse, and was continued throughout the reign of Tipu Sultan, who added other denominations. Tipu Sultan introduced a set of new [[Persian language|Persian]] names for the various denominations, which appear on all of the gold and silver coins and on some of the copper. They were:\n\n'''Copper''': Qutb \"\u0642\u0637\u0628\" for the 1/8 paisa ([[Persian language|Persian]] for the [[pole star]]) -- Akhtar \"\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0631\" for the 1/4 paisa (star) -- Bahram \"\u0628\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0645\" for the 1/2 paisa (the planet [[Mars]]) -- Zohra \"\u0632\u0647\u0631\u0647\" for the paisa (the planet [[Venus]]) -- either Othmani \"\u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc\" for the double-paisa ([[Uthman|the third caliph]] of the Rashidun) or Mushtari \"\u0645\u0634\u062a\u0631\u06cc\" (the planet [[Jupiter]]).\n\n'''Silver''': Khizri \"\u062e\u0636\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/32 rupee ([[Khidr|Khizr]] the prophet) -- Kazimi \"\u06a9\u0627\u0638\u0645\u06cc\" for the 1/16 rupee (for [[Musa al-Kadhim|Musa]], the seventh Shi'ite Imam) -- Ja'fari \"\u062c\u0639\u0641\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/8 rupee ([[Ja'far al-Sadiq]], the sixth Shi'ite Imam) -- B\u00e2qiri \"\u0628\u0627\u0642\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/4 rupee ([[Muhammad al-Baqir]], the fifth Imam) -- Abidi \"\u0639\u0628\u06cc\u062f\u06cc\" for the 1/2 rupee ([[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin|Ali Zain al-'Abidin]], the fourth Imam) -- Imami for the rupee (reference to the [[The Twelve Imams|12 Shi'ite Imams]]) -- Haidari \"\u062d\u06cc\u062f\u0631\u06cc\" for the double-rupee (lion, for [[Ali|Ali b. Abi Talib]], who was both the fourth caliph and the first Shi'ite Imam).\n\n'''Gold''': Faruqi \"\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0642\u06cc\" for the pagoda ([[Umar|Umar al-Faruq]], the second caliph) -- Sad\u00eeqi \"\u0635\u062f\u06cc\u0642\u06cc\" for the double-pagoda ([[Abu Bakr]] al-Sadiq, the first caliph) -- Ahmadi \"\u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f\u06cc\" for the four-pagoda ( \"most praised \", one of the name of the Prophet [[Muhammad]]). During his first 4 years, the large gold coin was the [[mohur]], with an average weight of about 10.95g (AH1197-1200), replaced with the four-pagoda of 13.74g with the calendar change to the Mauludi \"\u0645\u0648\u0644\u0648\u062f\u06cc\" system (AM1215-1219).\n\n===Coinage dating system===\nThe denomination does not appear on the [[Islamic calendar|Hijri]] dated gold coins, but was added on all the Mauludi dated pieces.\n\nAt the beginning of his first year, Tipu Sultan abandoned the [[Islamic calendar|Hijri]] dating system and introduced the Mauludi system (from the Arabic word \"walad \", which means \"birth \"), based on the [[Solar calendar|solar]] year and the birth year of the Prophet [[Muhammad]] (actually 571 AD, but for some perplexing reason reckoned as 572 by Tipu Sultan for his staff).\n\nFrom the beginning of his reign, Tipu Sultan added the name of the Indian cyclic year on the large silver and gold coins, including this double-pagoda, together with his regnal year. Each of the names is Persian, though in several examples, the meaning of the names in India was different from the Iranian meaning (not indicated here). According to the Indian meanings, these are the cyclic years: Zaki \"\u0632\u06a9\u064a\" for cyclic 37, which corresponded to his year 1 ( \"pure \") -- Az\u00e2l \"\u0623\u0632\u0644\" for 38 ( \"[[eternity]] \", year 2) -- Jalal \"\u062c\u064e\u0644\u0627\u0644\" for 39 ( \"splendor \", year 3) -- Dalv \"\u062f\u064e\u0644\u0648\" for 40 (the sign of [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]], year 4) -- Sh\u00e2 \"\u0634\u0627\u0647\" for 41 ( \"king \", year 5) -- S\u00e2r\u00e2 \"\u0633\u0627\u0631\u0627\" for 42 ( \"fragrant \", year 6) -- Sar\u00e2b \"\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0628\" for 43 ( \"[[mirage]] \", for year 7) -- Shit\u00e2 \"\u0634\u062a\u0627\" for 44 ( \"winter \", year 8) -- Zabarjad \"\u0632\u0628\u0631\u062c\u062f\" for 45 ( \"topaz \", year 9) -- sahar \"\u0633\u064e\u062d\u064e\u0631\" ( \"[[dawn]] \", year 10) -- S\u00e2her \"\u0633\u0627\u062d\u0650\u0631\" ( \"magician \", year 11).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coinarchives.com/w/lotviewer.php?LotID=3800760&AucID=3949&Lot=2596&Val=8b527bcdc15cad93b00771f495bbf0ca|title=CoinArchives.com Lot Viewer|website=www.coinarchives.com|access-date=2019-04-17}}</ref>\n\n==Assessment and legacy==\n[[File:Double paisa of Tipu Sultan.jpg|thumb|right|Among his many innovations, Tipu introduced new coin denominations and new coin types, including this handsome copper double paisa weighing over 23 gm.

Kirkpatrick ''Select Letters of Tipu Sultan'', London 1811</ref> and [[Mark Wilks]],<ref>M.

A bunch of about 30 letters written in [[Kannada]], which were exchanged between Tipu Sultan's court and the [[Sringeri]] [[Shankaracharya]] were discovered in 1916 by the Director of Archaeology in [[Mysore]]. Tipu Sultan expressed his indignation and grief at the news of the raid:<ref name=\"Hasan358\">{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hkbJ6xA1_jEC&pg=PA358|title=History of Tipu Sultan|author=Mohibbul Hasan|page=358|isbn=9788187879572|year=2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/bO9Ma9Sb2g4aUvIUT29fCP/Why-we-love-to-hate-Tipu-Sultan.html|title=Why we love to hate Tipu Sultan|author=Vikram Sampath|work=www.livemint.com/|date=2014-01-31}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"People who have sinned against such a holy place are sure to suffer the consequences of their misdeeds at no distant date in this Kali age in accordance with the verse: \"Hasadbhih kriyate karma rudadbhir-anubhuyate\" (People do [evil] deeds smilingly but suffer the consequences crying).\"<ref>''Annual Report of the Mysore Archaeological Department'' 1916 pp&nbsp;10\u201311, 73\u20136</ref> </blockquote>\n\nHe immediately ordered the Asaf of [[Bednur]] to supply the Swami with 200 ''rahati''s (''[[Travancore Fanam|fanam]]''s) in cash and other gifts and articles.

A. Saletare has described Tipu Sultan as a defender of the Hindu [[dharma]], who also patronised other temples including one at Melkote, for which he issued a Kannada decree that the Shrivaishnava invocatory verses there should be recited in the traditional form.{{Citation needed|date= April 2018}} The temple at Melkote still has gold and silver vessels with inscriptions indicating that they were presented by the Sultan.

''Confronting Colonialism'', pp. 116\u20138</ref> Tipu Sultan does seem to have repossessed unauthorised grants of land made to [[Brahmin]]s and temples, but those which had proper ''sanads'' (certificates) were not. It was a normal practice for any ruler, Muslim or Hindu, on his accession or on the conquest of new territory.\n\nNoted for his persecution of Christians, historian Thomas Paul notes that Tipu had shifted his hatred for the British to Catholics of Mangalore and other Christian communities of [[South India]].<ref>Thomas, Paul (1954), Christians and Christianity in India and Pakistan: a general survey of the progress of Christianity in India from apostolic times to the present day, Allen & Unwin, p. 235</ref> According to historian Praxy Fernandes, Tipu Sultan was \"an enlightened monarch who followed a secular policy towards his subjects.\"<ref name=\"mehta\"/>\n\n[[C.

He asserted that Tipu's \"religious fanaticism and the excesses committed in the name of religion, both in Mysore and in the provinces, stand condemned for all time.

There were repeated attempts to capture Kodagu by the sultan and his father [[Hyder Ali]] before him. The primary reason for Sultan's interest in Kodagu was that annexing Kodagu would provide access to Mangalore port. The Kodavas knew their lands and mountains very well which made them excellent at guerrilla warfare. Kodavas were outnumbered 3 to 1 in most of Tippu's attempts to annex Kodagu but they managed to beat back Tippu most of the times by drawing his army towards hilly regions of their land. On few occasions Tippu's army managed to reach Madikeri (Capital of Kodagu) but the Kodavas always ambushed the contingent left behind by Tippu. Kodavas refusal to bow to the sultan was primarily because throughout their history they enjoyed independence, though there were Rajahs ruling over them, governance of the land mainly rested with Kodavas. After capturing Kodagu on another occasion, Tippu proclaimed, \"If you ever dare to ambush my men again, I will honor everyone of you with Islam\", undeterred, the resilient Kodavas ambushed his men yet again and drove them back to Mysore. By now Tippu realised conventional warfare would never yield him Kodagu. He devised a plan to annex Kodagu by offering his friendship. His offer of friendship was welcomed by Kodavas as the battles with the Sultan over the years had cost them dearly. When Kodavas welcomed Sultan to their land in the name of friendship, the Sultan and his men attacked them and took thousands as prisoners. -->\nTipu got Runmust Khan, the ''[[Kurnool|Nawab of Kurnool]]'', to launch a surprise attack upon the [[Kodava people|Kodava]] Hindus who were besieged by the invading Muslim army. 500 were killed and over 40,000 Kodavas fled to the woods and concealed themselves in the mountains.<ref name=\"Prabhu\">{{harvnb|Prabhu|1999|p=223}}</ref> Thousands of Kodavas were seized along with the Raja and held captive at Seringapatam.

For instance, there were a significant number of forced conversions of British captives between 1780 and 1784. Following their disastrous defeat at the 1780 [[Battle of Pollilur]], 7,000 British men along with an unknown number of women were held captive by Tipu in the fortress of Seringapatnam. Of these, over 300 were circumcised and given Muslim names and clothes and several British regimental drummer boys were made to wear ''[[ghagra cholis]]'' and entertain the court as ''nautch'' girls or dancing girls. After the 10-year-long captivity ended, James Scurry, one of those prisoners, recounted that he had forgotten how to sit in a chair and use a knife and fork. His English was broken and stilted, having lost all his vernacular idiom. His skin had darkened to the swarthy complexion of [[negro]]es, and moreover, he had developed an aversion to wearing European clothes.<ref>William Dalrymple ''White Mughals'' (2006) p.28</ref>\n\nDuring the surrender of the Mangalore fort which was delivered in an armistice by the British and their subsequent withdrawal, all the [[Mestizos]] and remaining non-British foreigners were killed, together with 5,600 Mangalorean Catholics. Those condemned by Tipu Sultan for treachery were hanged instantly, the gibbets being weighed down by the number of bodies they carried. The Netravati River was so putrid with the stench of dying bodies, that the local residents were forced to leave their riverside homes.<ref name=\"Lobo2\"/>\n\nThe Archbishop of Goa wrote in 1800, ''\"It is notoriously known in all Asia and all other parts of the globe of the oppression and sufferings experienced by the Christians in the Dominion of the King of Kanara, during the usurpation of that country by Tipu Sultan from an implacable hatred he had against them who professed Christianity.\"''<ref name=\"Lobo2\"/>\n[[File:James Scurry.jpg|thumb|left|The British officer [[James Scurry]], who was detained a prisoner for 10 years by Tipu Sultan along with the Mangalorean Catholics]]\nTipu Sultan's invasion of the Malabar had an adverse impact on the [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani]] community of the Malabar coast. Many churches in the [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] and [[Cochin]] were damaged. The old Syrian Nasrani seminary at Angamaly which had been the center of Catholic religious education for several centuries was razed to the ground by Tipu's soldiers. A lot of centuries old religious manuscripts were lost forever. The church was later relocated to Kottayam where it still exists to this date. The Mor Sabor church at Akaparambu and the Martha Mariam Church attached to the seminary were destroyed as well. Tipu's army set fire to the church at Palayoor and attacked the Ollur Church in 1790. Furthernmore, the Arthat church and the Ambazhakkad seminary was also destroyed. Over the course of this invasion, many Syrian Malabar Nasrani were killed or forcibly converted to Islam. Most of the coconut, arecanut, pepper and cashew plantations held by the Syrian Malabar farmers were also indiscriminately destroyed by the invading army. As a result, when Tipu's army invaded Guruvayur and adjacent areas, the Syrian Christian community fled Calicut and small towns like Arthat to new centres like Kunnamkulam, Chalakudi, Ennakadu, Cheppadu, Kannankode, [[Mavelikkara]], etc. where there were already Christians. They were given refuge by Sakthan Tamburan, the ruler of Cochin and Karthika Thirunal, the ruler of Travancore, who gave them lands, plantations and encouraged their businesses. Colonel Macqulay, the British resident of Travancore also helped them.<ref name= Bernard >K.L.

Local South India coinage had been struck in the area that became [[Mysore]] since ancient times, with the first gold coinage introduced about the 11th century (the elephant [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]]), and other pagodas continuing through the following centuries. These [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]] were always in the South Indian style until the reign of [[Hyder Ali|Haidar Ali]] (1761-1782), who added pagodas with Persian legends, plus a few very rare gold mohurs and silver rupees, always in the name of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Shah Alam II]] plus the Arabic letter \"\u062d\" as the first letter of his name. His successor, Tipu Sultan, continued to issue [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]]<nowiki/>s, mohurs and [[rupee]]s, with legends that were completely new. As for copper, the new large [[paisa]] was commenced by Haidar Ali in AH1195, two years before his death, with the elephant on the obverse, the mint on the reverse, and was continued throughout the reign of Tipu Sultan, who added other denominations. Tipu Sultan introduced a set of new [[Persian language|Persian]] names for the various denominations, which appear on all of the gold and silver coins and on some of the copper. They were:\n\n'''Copper''': Qutb \"\u0642\u0637\u0628\" for the 1/8 paisa ([[Persian language|Persian]] for the [[pole star]]) -- Akhtar \"\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0631\" for the 1/4 paisa (star) -- Bahram \"\u0628\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0645\" for the 1/2 paisa (the planet [[Mars]]) -- Zohra \"\u0632\u0647\u0631\u0647\" for the paisa (the planet [[Venus]]) -- either Othmani \"\u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc\" for the double-paisa ([[Uthman|the third caliph]] of the Rashidun) or Mushtari \"\u0645\u0634\u062a\u0631\u06cc\" (the planet [[Jupiter]]).\n\n'''Silver''': Khizri \"\u062e\u0636\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/32 rupee ([[Khidr|Khizr]] the prophet) -- Kazimi \"\u06a9\u0627\u0638\u0645\u06cc\" for the 1/16 rupee (for [[Musa al-Kadhim|Musa]], the seventh Shi'ite Imam) -- Ja'fari \"\u062c\u0639\u0641\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/8 rupee ([[Ja'far al-Sadiq]], the sixth Shi'ite Imam) -- B\u00e2qiri \"\u0628\u0627\u0642\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/4 rupee ([[Muhammad al-Baqir]], the fifth Imam) -- Abidi \"\u0639\u0628\u06cc\u062f\u06cc\" for the 1/2 rupee ([[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin|Ali Zain al-'Abidin]], the fourth Imam) -- Imami for the rupee (reference to the [[The Twelve Imams|12 Shi'ite Imams]]) -- Haidari \"\u062d\u06cc\u062f\u0631\u06cc\" for the double-rupee (lion, for [[Ali|Ali b. Abi Talib]], who was both the fourth caliph and the first Shi'ite Imam).\n\n'''Gold''': Faruqi \"\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0642\u06cc\" for the pagoda ([[Umar|Umar al-Faruq]], the second caliph) -- Sad\u00eeqi \"\u0635\u062f\u06cc\u0642\u06cc\" for the double-pagoda ([[Abu Bakr]] al-Sadiq, the first caliph) -- Ahmadi \"\u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f\u06cc\" for the four-pagoda ( \"most praised \", one of the name of the Prophet [[Muhammad]]). During his first 4 years, the large gold coin was the [[mohur]], with an average weight of about 10.95g (AH1197-1200), replaced with the four-pagoda of 13.74g with the calendar change to the Mauludi \"\u0645\u0648\u0644\u0648\u062f\u06cc\" system (AM1215-1219).\n\n===Coinage dating system===\nThe denomination does not appear on the [[Islamic calendar|Hijri]] dated gold coins, but was added on all the Mauludi dated pieces.\n\nAt the beginning of his first year, Tipu Sultan abandoned the [[Islamic calendar|Hijri]] dating system and introduced the Mauludi system (from the Arabic word \"walad \", which means \"birth \"), based on the [[Solar calendar|solar]] year and the birth year of the Prophet [[Muhammad]] (actually 571 AD, but for some perplexing reason reckoned as 572 by Tipu Sultan for his staff).\n\nFrom the beginning of his reign, Tipu Sultan added the name of the Indian cyclic year on the large silver and gold coins, including this double-pagoda, together with his regnal year. Each of the names is Persian, though in several examples, the meaning of the names in India was different from the Iranian meaning (not indicated here). According to the Indian meanings, these are the cyclic years: Zaki \"\u0632\u06a9\u064a\" for cyclic 37, which corresponded to his year 1 ( \"pure \") -- Az\u00e2l \"\u0623\u0632\u0644\" for 38 ( \"[[eternity]] \", year 2) -- Jalal \"\u062c\u064e\u0644\u0627\u0644\" for 39 ( \"splendor \", year 3) -- Dalv \"\u062f\u064e\u0644\u0648\" for 40 (the sign of [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]], year 4) -- Sh\u00e2 \"\u0634\u0627\u0647\" for 41 ( \"king \", year 5) -- S\u00e2r\u00e2 \"\u0633\u0627\u0631\u0627\" for 42 ( \"fragrant \", year 6) -- Sar\u00e2b \"\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0628\" for 43 ( \"[[mirage]] \", for year 7) -- Shit\u00e2 \"\u0634\u062a\u0627\" for 44 ( \"winter \", year 8) -- Zabarjad \"\u0632\u0628\u0631\u062c\u062f\" for 45 ( \"topaz \", year 9) -- sahar \"\u0633\u064e\u062d\u064e\u0631\" ( \"[[dawn]] \", year 10) -- S\u00e2her \"\u0633\u0627\u062d\u0650\u0631\" ( \"magician \", year 11).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coinarchives.com/w/lotviewer.php?LotID=3800760&AucID=3949&Lot=2596&Val=8b527bcdc15cad93b00771f495bbf0ca|title=CoinArchives.com Lot Viewer|website=www.coinarchives.com|access-date=2019-04-17}}</ref>\n\n==Assessment and legacy==\n[[File:Double paisa of Tipu Sultan.jpg|thumb|right|Among his many innovations, Tipu introduced new coin denominations and new coin types, including this handsome copper double paisa weighing over 23 gm.

The original idea for the show came from two ex-firemen from [[London]], England, who took their idea to artist and writer Rob Lee who developed the concept, and the show was commissioned.\n\n''Fireman Sam'' first appeared as '''''Sam T\u00e2n''''' (''Fireman Sam'' in Welsh) on [[S4C]] in 1987, and at the same time on [[BBC One]]. The original series finished in 1994, and a new series that expanded the character cast commenced in 2005. The series was also shown in [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] in Scotland. The series was sold to over 40 countries and has been used across the UK to promote [[fire safety]].\n\n==Development==\nThe original idea came about from two ex-firemen from [[London]], England \u2013 Dave Gingell and [[David Jones (writer)|David Jones]] after [[Commission (art)|purchasing]] the [[stop motion]] animation drawn by artist Anthony Miller and [[Will Vinton]]. They approached [[Mike Young (producer)|Mike Young]], creator of ''[[SuperTed]]'', in [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]], Wales, and asked them to further develop their concept. The idea was then brought to S4C's Director of Animation, Chris Grace, who had previously commissioned ''SuperTed'', saw potential in the idea and commissioned the series. The characters and storylines were created by Rob Lee, an illustrator from Cardiff, and the programme was made using [[stop motion]]. It could take up to four days to produce one minute of this form of puppet animation. ''Fireman Sam'' has to this day been translated into over 25 different languages including Mandarin.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.firemansamonline.com/uk/Parents/About_Sam/index.asp | title=About Sam | accessdate=4 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the original series, all the character voices were performed by [[John Alderton]]. The later series used several actors' voices.\n\n==History==\n\n===Original series (1987\u20131994)===\nThe original series comprised 32 ten-minute episodes and a 20-minute [[Christmas special]]. The narration and all the character voices were done by [[John Alderton]].  Fireman Sam is the main character of the show, and interacts with both colleagues at the [[fire station]] and fellow villagers. He is seen as somewhat of a hero in the village. Despite being so small, and with so little activity, the village sees its fair share of fires, which Sam and his team can easily handle. The vehicles at the fire station include a four-wheeled [[Bedford TK]] fire engine called Jupiter, a six-wheeled 1982 [[TACR2 (Range Rover)|Range Rover Rescue Tender]] named Venus, and Trevor's Bus, a 1985 [[Ford Transit]] Dormobile. Fireman Sam's colleagues are Elvis Cridlington, Station Officer Basil Steele (renamed Norris Steele in the new [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] series) and later Penny Morris (who hailed from Newtown with the firetender). The villagers are bus driver/auxiliary firefighter Trevor Evans, Italian caf\u00e9 owner Bella Lasagne, Norman Price, Norman's mother Dilys Price, and the twins Sarah and James Jones. The objects include M.O.P., Bentley the Robot, and Mechanical Master Chef.\n\nThe original series aired on [[BBC One]], [[CBBC]] and [[CBeebies]] since it was launched in 1987, most commonly airing on CBeebies on a daily basis with repeats showing until 28 December 2007. In the original series produced by [[Bumper Films]] from 1987 to 1994, the firefighters had yellow and black uniforms, whereas in the 2005 series produced by Siriol Productions and [[Gullane Entertainment]] (Later [[HIT Entertainment]]) and the 2008 [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] series produced by [[HIT Entertainment]] (Later [[Mattel Creations]], then Mattel Television), Xing-Xing, [[WildBrain]] and [[DHX Media]], the firefighters now have yellow and blue uniforms.\n\nIn 1988, the original series was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Short Animated Film. The potential recipients were Ian Frampton and John Walker.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0329829/awards | title=Awards for \"Fireman Sam\" (1987) | accessdate=4 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n===2005 series===\nIn 2005, a new ''Fireman Sam'' series was produced by [[Calon (TV production company)|Siriol Productions]] for [[HIT Entertainment]], comprising twenty-six episodes, each ten minutes in length. These episodes used more modern techniques of stop motion [[clay animation|claymation]] including mouths that move with the dialogue. This series featured all the original characters, but also introduced some new faces, such as Tom Thomas, the Australian pilot of the rescue helicopter Wallaby One and the Mountain Rescue 4\u00d74 Jeep, an unnamed photographer/news reporter, and the Flood family; consisting of Mike The Plumber, his wife Helen The Nurse, and their daughter Mandy. The updated Jupiter has six wheels, loosely based on a Bedford 6\u00d74,{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} and Venus is loosely based on a heavily modified 4x4 [[Mini|Mini Cooper]]. The characters in this series were voiced by [[John Sparkes]], Joanna Ruiz and Sarah Hadland. The series also premiered on CBeebies in 2005 and repeats were shown until 2007.\n\n===CGI series (2008\u2013present)===\nThe series was revamped in 2008 which saw the show convert to [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]. Pontypandy is now a seaside fishing village instead of a village set deep in the hills, though most of the locations have retained their appearances. Another change in this series is that the twins' parents appear for the first time; their new-age mother Bronwyn, and fisherman father Charlie, Sam's brother, who runs a caf\u00e9/fish-and-chip shop called the 'Whole Fish Caf\u00e9'. The series was produced by Xing-Xing from 2008-2016 and [[DHX Media]] (Later [[WildBrain]])/IoM Media Ventures Halifax for [[HIT Entertainment]] (Later [[Mattel|Mattel Creations]], then Mattel Television) from 2017\u2013present\n\nJupiter was updated again, now with a front end taken from a Volvo FL6. A yellow stripe  was added to the front of the fire engine. Minor changes were made to Venus which included a water nozzle added to the top of its roof. Trevor's bus was updated to a more modern look with angled headlights. New vehicles introduced included Mike Flood's Van in the sixth season onwards, as well as Mercury (fire quad bike), Saturn (infrared drone), The Pontypandy Flyer (Steam Locomotive), and Bessie (Steeles first fire engine) which were introduced from the eighth season onwards.\n\nThe outfits were updated throughout the series (except for Norman Price). This included an update to the firefighter's outfits which added reflective stripes and extra badges to their tunics. Dilys Price received a large makeover which saw her getting makeup, glasses, black hair, a necklace and an updated outfit. The rest of the characters also received minor updates to their clothing.\n\nMany characters also had aspects of their personalities made more apparent. Norman Price is far more mischievous and inconsiderate than in the 2005 series where his pranks were often planned out and his accidents were due to badly planned ideas instead of outrageous schemes. For example, in the episode \"Pontypandy Extreme\", Norman gets trapped down a [[wishing well]] after attempting to climb down in order to retrieve the coins from the bottom. Other examples are Station Officer Steele's strictness and maturity and Elvis's decrease in general competence. For example, in one episode where a first aid training exercise is taking place, Elvis is told off by Steele for dancing with the dummy that is being used. At the same time, Steele is not afraid to unleash the child within him, showing an interest in kite flying and paper planes. He also occasionally causes emergencies himself and often gasps when an emergency comes in. Also, Station Officer Steele's name has changed to Station Officer Norris Steele.\n\nOther changes include the removal of Bella, although her caf\u00e9 can still be seen opposite Dilys' shop, now a [[7-Eleven]]-esque convenience store called the \"Cut Price Supermarket\". It seems the Whole Fish Caf\u00e9 and Bronwyn and Charlie have replaced them. Bella made her first appearance in CGI in the tenth season, where the reason behind her absence was revealed as her moving to Newtown. Penny also now has another string to her bow, as she is a trained ocean rescuer and the helmsman of Neptune (the village's lifeboat). Also, Rosa and Dusty have been replaced by Lion, Nipper, and Radar.\n\nSince 2012, additional characters were introduced: Chief Fire Officer Boyce, one animal called Norris the Guinea Pig, five new villagers named Derek Price  (originally introduced in season 6 as a minor character but then recurring since The Great Fire of Pontypandy), Moose Roberts, Gareth Griffiths, Lily, and Mrs Chen.\n\nIn 2014, other characters were introduced: a coastguard named Ben Hooper, a mechanic & inventor named Joe Sparkes with his vet wife Lizzie Sparkes, and their daughter Hannah Sparkes. Also, new vehicles were introduced: a jet ski named Juno and a fire boat named Titan. Also in the movie \"Heroes of the Storm\", there is Ellie Phillips and Arnold McKinley, new firefighter members. There is Hydrus (previously Catfish or Wildcat) the six-wheeled vehicle boat, and an unnamed Mobile Command Unit, and from 2017 onwards, Bella Lasag\u00f1e makes her CGI debut and the fire station has a new vehicle; Phoenix, the animal rescue 4X4. & Wallaby 1's replacement, is a search & rescue helicopter, Wallaby 2.\n\nThe characters in this series are voiced by [[Steven Kynman]], Andrew Hodwitz, Jonah Ain, Maraget Brock, Tegwen Tucker, Lily Cassano, Dave Pender, Jacob James, Scott Lancastle, Ashley Magwood, David Carling, Mike Pongrazc, Becky Shrimpton, Sarah Lynn Strange Carter Treneer, and Su Douglas.Joe Marth join the cast in 2010, [[John Hasler]], Ifan Huw Dafydd and [[Nigel Whitmey]] joined the cast In 2012 [[Alex Lowe]] [[Christa Clahane]] [[Adam Turgeon]] and [[Jo Wyatt]] joined the cast in 2015.

The single was put together by [[Peter Kay]].\n\nThe show saw its first feature-length movie, ''The Great Fire of Pontypandy'', released to DVD and iTunes in 2010, and was shown in select cinemas.\n\n''Fireman Sam'' was adapted into a live musical theatre show, which began touring the UK in June 2011.\n\nIn 2014, [[Amazon Prime]] released ''Fireman Sam'' using American voices instead of British voices for children in the US. However, the characters of Tom Thomas, Moose Roberts and Bella Lasagna have their regular, respective Australian, Canadian and Italian voices (instead of their being dubbed them with a US voice actor) due to their accents. This features the voices of Andrew Hodwitz Jonah Ain Maraget Brock Lily Cassano Dave Pender Jacob James Scott Lancastle Ashley Magwood Mike Pongrazc Becky Shrimpton Sarah Lynn Strange Carter Treneer And David Carling\n\nIn 2015, the show's second feature-length movie ''Heroes of the Storm'' (also known as ''Ultimate Heroes'' in the US) was due to be released in September 2015; however, it was released for American audiences in November 2014.<ref>{{Citation|title=Fireman Sam: Heroes of the Storm (Video 2014)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4460032/releaseinfo|accessdate=16 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] website said of the series, \"All the characters blend together into an appealing mixture of fun and entertainment for children everywhere.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/abckids/shows/prog64.htm | title=Fireman Sam at ABC | accessdate=4 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Common Sense Media]] recommended the 2003 series for ages three and up, praising it for showing how to \"stay calm in a crisis\" and rely on a team to solve problems. The American website found that the \"distinctly Welsh characters, community, accents, and expressions may pose some minor comprehension problems for kids on this side of the pond\", but considered it a useful example of life in another part of the world.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/Fireman-Sam.html | title=Fireman Sam at commonsensemedia | accessdate=4 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Controversies==\n[[File:Fireman Sam Quran.jpg|thumb|A page from the [[Quran]] appearing in ''Fireman Sam'', in a banned episode controversy]]\nIn July 2016, it emerged that in Series 9, Episode 7 - in which the character Elvis slips on a piece of paper and falls into a stack of paper, causing them to fly everywhere - one of the flying pages that briefly came into view was identified as a page from the [[Quran]]: \"Surah Mulk (67), verses 13\u201326\".<ref name=\"Quran\">{{cite web|last1=Evans|first1=Patrick|title=Fireman Sam episode pulled amid Quran row|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36900310|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=30 July 2016|date=27 July 2016}}</ref> The production company Mattel apologised for this accident, removed the episode from broadcast, and ceased work with Xing Xing, the animation company responsible for the error.

She proposed that Fireman Sam should be renamed \"Firefighter Sam\", and said that research showed that women are put off a career in the fire service because it is seen as a job for men. She also claimed that as ''Fireman Sam'' is seen by children from an early age, he reinforces this stereotype.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why We Are Campaigning To Shake Off The Outdated Term 'Firemen'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/dany-cotton/firefighter-dany-cotton_b_18293684.html|website=HuffPost UK}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{BBC programme}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n*[http://www.firemansam.com/en-gb Official Fireman Sam website]\n*{{IMDb title|id=0329829|title=Fireman Sam}}\n\n{{Portal|Wales|United Kingdom|United States|Animation|Television}}\n{{Media in Cardiff}}\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1987]]\n[[Category:1987 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1980s British children's television series]]\n[[Category:1990s British children's television series]]\n[[Category:2000s British children's television series]]\n[[Category:2003 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2008 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2010s British children's television series]]\n[[Category:1980s British animated television series]]\n[[Category:1990s British animated television series]]\n[[Category:2000s British animated television series]]\n[[Category:2010s British animated television series]]\n[[Category:British children's animated comedy television series]]\n[[Category:British children's animated drama television series]]\n[[Category:British computer-animated television series]]\n[[Category:British stop-motion animated television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Australian Broadcasting Corporation shows]]\n[[Category:BBC children's television programmes]]\n[[Category:The Den]]\n[[Category:S4C television programmes]]\n[[Category:Qubo]]\n[[Category:Fictional firefighters]]\n[[Category:Television series by DHX Media]]\n[[Category:Television series by Mattel Creations]]\n[[Category:Television series about firefighting]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Wales]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Welsh animated children's television series}}\n{{Use British English|date=February 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2018}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = Fireman Sam\n| image                    = Fireman Sam logo.svg\n| caption                  = The logo from 2005 to 2014\n| genre                    = [[Stop motion]] (1987\u20132005)<br/>[[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] (2008\u2013present)\n| creator                  = Rob Lee<br/>Dave Gingell<br/>Dave Jones<br/>\n| writer                   = Various\n| voices                   = [[John Alderton]]<br/>[[John Sparkes]]<br/>[[Joanna Ruiz]]<br/>[[Sarah Hadland]]<br/>[[Steven Kynman]]<br/>David Carling<br/>Su Douglas<br/>Tegwen Tucker<br/>Ifan Huw Dafydd<br/>[[Nigel Whitmey]]<br/>[[John Hasler]]<br/>[[Alex Lowe (actor)|Alex Lowe]]<br/>[[Jo Wyatt]] \n| narrated                 = [[John Alderton]] (1987\u20131994)\n| country                  = [[Wales]], United Kingdom\n| language                 = British-English, Welsh\n| num_episodes             = 226\n| list_episodes            = List of Fireman Sam episodes\n| producer                 = Various\n| runtime                  = 10 minutes (series)<br/>20 minutes (Christmas special episode)\n| company                  = [[S4C]] (1987-2005)<br>[[HIT Entertainment]] (2005-2016)<br>[[Mattel Creations|Mattel Television]] (2017-2018)<br>'''ANIMATION'''<br>[[Bumper Films]] (1987\u20131994)<br>[[Calon (TV production company)|Siriol Productions]] (2005)<br>HRTv (2008\u20132010)<br />Xing Xing Management Group (2008\u20132017)<br />[[Halifax Film|IoM Media Ventures Halifax]] (2017\u2013present)<ref>https://www.wildbrain.com/newsreleases/wildbrain-and-mattel-tv-come-to-the-rescue-with-fireman-sam-season-12/</ref>\n| distributor              = [[HIT Entertainment]] (2005\u20132016)<br>[[WildBrain]] (2017\u2013present)\n| network                  = '''Wales''' -

The original idea for the show came from two ex-firemen from [[London]], England, who took their idea to artist and writer Rob Lee who developed the concept, and the show was commissioned.\n\n''Fireman Sam'' first appeared as '''''Sam T\u00e2n''''' (''Fireman Sam'' in Welsh) on [[S4C]] in 1987, and at the same time on [[BBC One]]. The original series finished in 1994, and a new series that expanded the character cast commenced in 2005. The series was also shown in [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] in Scotland. The series was sold to over 40 countries and has been used across the UK to promote [[fire safety]].\n\n==Development==\nThe original idea came about from two ex-firemen from [[London]], England \u2013 Dave Gingell and [[David Jones (writer)|David Jones]] after [[Commission (art)|purchasing]] the [[stop motion]] animation drawn by artist Anthony Miller and [[Will Vinton]].
