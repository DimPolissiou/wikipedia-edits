Clay Kaserne''' ({{lang-de|Flugplatz Wiesbaden-Erbenheim}}) {{airport codes|WIE|ETOU}}, commonly known as '''Clay Kaserne''', is an [[Military base|installation]] of the [[United States Army]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]]. The ''[[kaserne]]'' is located within [[Wiesbaden-Erbenheim]]. It is named for General [[Lucius D. Clay]]. It is the home of the Army's [[2d Signal Brigade (United States)|2d Theater Signal Brigade]], [[66th Military Intelligence Brigade]] and is the headquarters of the [[United States Army Europe|U.S. Army Europe]] (USAREUR), which oversees the [[7th Army Training Command]], [[10th Army Air and Missile Defense Command|10th Army Air & Missile Defense Command]] and [[21st Theater Sustainment Command]]. Clay Kaserne also maintains an airfield.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\nThe land on which present-day Clay Kaserne now stands was originally built in 1910 as a [[race track|race track]] for horses. In 1929, the race track was converted into a regional [[airport]]. The ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' took over operations in 1936. One unit stationed at the airfield was [[Jagdgeschwader 50|''Jagdgruppe'' 50]], a fighter group of [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]s.\n\n===World War II===\nOn August 17, 1943, ''Jagdgruppe'' 50 intercepted American bombers taking part in the ill-fated [[Schweinfurt-Regensburg mission|Regensburg Strike]] targeting the Messerschmitt factory in [[Regensburg]] and the ball bearing plants in [[Schweinfurt]].

From Berlin an EATS plane made weekly flights to [[Warsaw]], Poland. Flights originated from Vienna for [[Bucharest]], [[Belgrade]], [[Sofia]], and [[Budapest]]. In the Mediterranean area EATS flights connected [[Udine]], [[Pisa]], [[Rome]], and [[Naples]]. EATS originally was composed of left-over wartime troop carrier squadrons, glider and fighter pilots, [[B-17 Flying Fortress units of the United States Army Air Forces|B-17 \"Flying Fortress\"]] crewmen and other available personnel. In addition to regular flights which service the Army of Occupation, EATS also operated special flights such as providing transportation for diplomatic officials, evacuating sick or wounded, performing mercy flights, aiding [[Graves Registration Service|Graves Registration]] in returning the remains of American soldiers and rushing supplies to needy areas.\n\nIn 1948 the installation served as a hub supporting the [[Berlin Blockade|Berlin Airlift]] with around-the-clock flights to [[Tempelhof]] Airport. Airmen from Wiesbaden distinguished themselves in support of \"Operation Vittles\". [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47 \"Skytrain\"]]s and [[C-54]] \"Skymasters\" of the 60th Troop Carrier Group flew missions daily to Tempelhof in the beleaguered city of Berlin. During one day's operations more than 80 tons of food and supplies were airlifted from Wiesbaden. The streets on Wiesbaden Air Base were named after servicemen who gave their lives during the Airlift. On 4 July 1956 a [[Lockheed U-2|U-2A]] stationed in Wiesbaden flew over both [[Moscow]] and [[Leningrad]] as part of Operation Overflight, missions to spy on Soviet military bases. This was the first flight by a U-2 over the [[Soviet Union]].

The Air Force moved most personnel out of Wiesbaden in 1975 as part of Operation Creek Swap, in which most Army facilities in Kaiserslautern were turned over to the Air Force, in exchange for the facilities at Wiesbaden. The 4th Brigade, [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]], was stationed at Wiesbaden in 1976 as part of \"Brigade 76\" until it was replaced by the [[3rd Sustainment Command (Expeditionary)|3d Corps Support Command]] and [[12th Combat Aviation Brigade|12th Aviation Brigade]] in the mid-1980s. In the mid-1980s, the base served as a landing point for the [[Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk|F-117 \"Nighthawk\"]] \"Stealth Fighter\". Although not officially acknowledged by the Air Force until 1988, the F-117 became operational in 1983. The Wiesbaden Air Base would \"go dark\", turning off all airfield and perimeter lights, whenever \"stealth\" flights were landing or taking off. From 1975 to 1993, the air base was a joint Army/Air Force community.

Throughout the games, the player primarily battles transformed humans as well as synthetic and mechanical enemies that are the product of Combine technology.

The military Overwatch forces of the Combine are shown attacking human resistance bases in an effort to further solidify their control.

Located within City 17, the Citadel serves as the primary headquarters of the Combine, housing both Combine Advisors and the office of the Earth administrator, [[Wallace Breen]].

The most commonly encountered enemies throughout ''Half-Life 2'' and its expansions are the [[transhuman]] Overwatch soldiers and human Civil Protection officers. In addition, a variety of combat machines appear, ranging from [[Armored personnel carrier|APCs]] and [[helicopter gunship]]s to a giant 'smart wall' which encloses occupied cities and gradually destroys anything in its path, as well as a number of weaponized alien 'synths'.<ref name=\"IGNHL2enemies\">{{cite web|url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2GameInfo.Detail&id=3&game=3|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022155450/http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2GameInfo.Detail&id=3&game=3|archivedate=October 22, 2006 |title=''Half-Life 2'' Enemies|work=Planet Half-Life|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-09-23}}</ref>\n\n====Advisors====\n[[Image:Advisor (Half-Life).jpg|thumb|right|The Advisor's grub-like appearance was inspired by the works of science fiction author [[Frank Herbert]].]]\nAdvisors are large larvae-like creatures which are virtually featureless, with no visible eyes, ears or limbs, though they do possess an eye-like mechanical device attached to the left side of their heads, and detachable mechanical arms.<ref name=\"EP1enemies\">{{cite web|url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2GameInfo.Detail&id=17&game=3|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426045206/http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2GameInfo.Detail&id=17&game=3|archivedate=April 26, 2013 |title=''Half-Life 2: Episode One'' Enemies|work=Planet Half-Life|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-09-23}}</ref> Their faces are covered by a form of respirator, which is able to lift to reveal a mouth-like orifice from which extends a long flexible [[proboscis]].

Also referred to as metrocops, Civil Protection units wear light armor and gas masks, which heavily resemble a somewhat modified [[PMK gas mask|Soviet PMG mask]]. They are usually armed with [[Electroshock weapon|electroshock batons]] and [[pistol]]s, and are occasionally seen using [[submachine gun]]s. Metrocops are brutal in their methods, keeping the local populace in line via intimidation and physical force. Interrogations, inspections, raids, random beatings, summary executions and acts of extreme [[police brutality]] are all used as a means of policing their respective jurisdictions; their methods are justified by their role as \"protectors of the civilians{{'}} well-being\". On the outskirts of [[City 17]], Civil Protection units are observed patrolling for escapees from the city. Civil Protection officers are in constant contact with Combine Overwatch headquarters, which gives them objectives and situation updates. On the death of an officer, that officer's armor detects that its wearer is no longer alive and automatically informs headquarters of the fatality and advises nearby units as to the place of death.<ref name=\"IGNHL2enemies\"/>\n\n====Overwatch====\nThe Combine Overwatch is the primary [[military]] force of the Combine on Earth. It consists of [[Biomechanical engineering|biomechanically]] [[Human enhancement|enhanced]] humans, who wear heavily padded long-sleeve body armor and gas masks. The markings on the suit change depending on each individual unit's assignment and rank. Elite Combine soldiers wear bright white armor with one red eye, while the majority of soldiers wear blue armor. Shotgun units wear similar armour to the standard Combine Soldier, but coloured brown with orange eyes. They are armed with a variety of firearms, including [[shotgun]]s, submachine guns, [[sniper rifle]]s and [[pulse rifle]]s. Overwatch soldiers usually operate in small groups, using squad tactics and [[grenade]]s to flush out and flank the player. They occasionally provide support to Combine synths, and often travel to areas by use of [[Dropship (science fiction)|dropships]]. They use radios to communicate with each other and with Overwatch headquarters. Combine Overwatch soldiers are usually encountered outside City 17, and only appear in the city after \"The Uprising\" near the end of ''Half-Life 2''.<ref name=\"IGNHL2enemies\"/>\n\n====Combine technology====\nThe Combine use a large array of [[science fiction]] technologies. They have access to [[teleportation]] technology, which takes them from their dimension to other dimensions. However, their teleporter technology is restrictive in comparison to that developed by [[Eli Vance]], [[Isaac Kleiner]] and [[Judith Mossman (Half Life)|Judith Mossman]] in that it cannot be used to teleport to other locations within a dimension, it can only be used to move between dimensions.<ref>{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] | date = 2004 | platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Black Mesa East| quote='''Judith Mossman''': We're closing in on a reliable local teleport technology, something the Combine still hasn't mastered. Eli thinks their models are string-based, similar to our Calabi-Yau model, but they fail to factor in the dark energy equations. They can tunnel through from their universe, but once they're here, they're dependent on local transportation.}}</ref> Throughout the games, various futuristic computer consoles, doors, power sources and weapon emplacements are encountered. In addition, the Combine employ the use of small airborne robots, scanners, to observe the citizens of Earth. The city variant merely moves about the streets, monitors individuals, and takes photographs, while the combat equivalent is capable of dropping mines into an area.<ref name=\"IGNHL2enemies\"/> Civil Protection makes use of smaller airborne robots called manhacks, which fly using razor-sharp rotating blades with which they attack their targets to cause [[laceration]] injuries. These are often deployed in closed-in areas. The Combine also use two types of [[land mine]]s; hopper mines throw themselves into the air and detonate when an enemy is detected nearby, while the spherical rollermines roll towards vehicles or other enemies, attach themselves and deliver damaging electrical attacks.<ref name=\"IGNHL2enemies\"/> Combine technology is also used to transform humans into Overwatch soldiers or stalkers, deformed and mutilated humans with no memory of their past selves who act as slaves and maintenance workers in Combine facilities. Transformation into a Stalker is considered among the Combine's worst punishments for dissidents.<ref name=\"EP1enemies\"/><ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Half-Life 2: Episode One]]|developer=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]]| date=2006|level=Direct Intervention|quote='''Alyx Vance''': Goddamn the Combine! This is what happens to you if you resist... or if you're just in the wrong place at the wrong time. [..] God, I hope you don't remember who you are...}}</ref>\n\nMilitarily, the Combine make use of both synthetics, creatures augmented with machinery, and traditional machines such as [[armored personnel carrier]]s and [[attack helicopters]].<ref name=\"IGNHL2enemies\"/> The most prominent of the synthetic machines are the insect-like [[gunship]]s; and Striders, {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} armored creatures that walk upon three legs, which are armed with a high powered warpspace cannon and a head-mounted pulse turret.<ref name=\"IGNHL2enemies\"/> In ''Episode Two'', the Hunter, a smaller equivalent to the Strider, is introduced. These 2.5&nbsp;m (8&nbsp;ft) tall, tripodal assault machines fire explosive flechettes at targets and are small enough to maneuver indoors. Other synths are seen near the end of the ''Half-Life 2'', although their roles are not elaborated on. [[Sentry gun|Sentry turrets]] are also used by the Combine.<ref name=\"IGNHL2enemies\"/> The Combine also use [[headcrab]]s as a [[biological weapon]] against dissidents, firing artillery shells loaded with the creatures into areas and allowing them to infest the vicinity.<ref name=\"IGNHL2enemies\"/>\n\n==Appearances==\n===''Half-Life'' series===\n{{expand section|Information about the Combine in Half-Life: Alyx|date=April 2020}}\nAccording to the backstory presented during ''Half-Life 2'', the Combine appear on Earth after the death of the [[Nihilanth]], the [[Boss (video games)|boss character]] at the end of ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]''. The death of the Nihilanth, a powerful creature controlling the dimensional rip between [[Xen (Half-Life)|Xen]] and the [[Black Mesa Research Facility]] on Earth, causes the rip to worsen, resulting in \"portal storms\" which spread the hostile wildlife of Xen across Earth. The Combine manipulate this tear in the spacetime continuum, widening it to allow access to Earth from their dimension. When sufficiently wide enough, the Combine launched an invasion in force. The [[United Nations Secretariat Building]] in [[New York City]] is destroyed and Earth is rapidly defeated in what became known as the Seven Hour War (the title is a reference to the Soviet military exercise [[:ru:\u0429\u0438\u0442-82|\u0429\u0438\u0442-82]]; \"Seven-Hour Nuclear War\"). Earth's surrender is negotiated by [[Wallace Breen]], who is then made the Combine's puppet administrator of Earth, and uses [[City 17]] as his base of operations.<ref name=\"BME\">{{cite web|url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2Walkthroughs.Detail&id=16&game=3|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113112249/http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2Walkthroughs.Detail&id=16&game=3|archivedate=November 13, 2012 |title=''Half-Life 2'' Walkthrough\u2014Chapter 5: Black Mesa East|work=Planet Half-Life|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Combine soldiers.png|thumb|left|Two Overwatch soldiers in ''Episode Two'', with a Hunter in the background.]]\n\nThe Combine's first appearance is in ''Half-Life 2''.

Due to Freeman's actions in ''Half-Life'', Breen sees Freeman as a major threat.<ref>{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] | date = 2004 | platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Water Hazard| quote='''Wallace Breen''': We now have direct confirmation of a disruptor in our midst, one who has acquired an almost messianic reputation in the minds of certain citizens.

And yet unsophisticated minds continue to embue him with romantic power, giving him such dangerous poetic labels as the \"One Free Man\", the \"Opener of the Way\".}}</ref> As Freeman escapes the city, Civil Protection units raid the resistance base of [[Black Mesa East]] and capture resistance leader [[Eli Vance]], who is transferred to holding facilities at [[Nova Prospekt]].<ref name=\"BME\"/> Freeman and Vance's daughter [[Alyx Vance|Alyx]] break into the facility to rescue him, but Eli Vance is teleported to the Combine Citadel by double agent [[Judith Mossman (Half Life)|Judith Mossman]].

Freeman manages to infiltrate the Citadel but is captured and taken to Breen.

A host body?! You must be joking, I can't possibly\u2014oh, all right, dammit, if that's what it takes. Just hurry, he's right behind me!}}</ref> Although Advisors are usually seen in protective pods guarded by Combine soldiers, they also possess [[telekinesis|telekinetic powers]] with which they are able to float through the air and immobilize enemies so that their proboscis can examine their victims without interference.<ref name=\"EP1enemies\"/> Their appearance was based on the [[Guild Navigator]]s from the film ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]''.<ref>''[[Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar]]''</ref>\n\n====Civil Protection====\nCivil Protection is the Combine's [[Police|law enforcement]] agency on Earth, consisting of humans who have agreed to work on behalf of the Combine. Also referred to as metrocops, Civil Protection units wear light armor and gas masks, which heavily resemble a somewhat modified [[PMK gas mask|Soviet PMG mask]]. They are usually armed with [[Electroshock weapon|electroshock batons]] and [[pistol]]s, and are occasionally seen using [[submachine gun]]s. Metrocops are brutal in their methods, keeping the local populace in line via intimidation and physical force. Interrogations, inspections, raids, random beatings, summary executions and acts of extreme [[police brutality]] are all used as a means of policing their respective jurisdictions; their methods are justified by their role as \"protectors of the civilians{{'}} well-being\". On the outskirts of [[City 17]], Civil Protection units are observed patrolling for escapees from the city. Civil Protection officers are in constant contact with Combine Overwatch headquarters, which gives them objectives and situation updates. On the death of an officer, that officer's armor detects that its wearer is no longer alive and automatically informs headquarters of the fatality and advises nearby units as to the place of death.<ref name=\"IGNHL2enemies\"/>\n\n====Overwatch====\nThe Combine Overwatch is the primary [[military]] force of the Combine on Earth. It consists of [[Biomechanical engineering|biomechanically]] [[Human enhancement|enhanced]] humans, who wear heavily padded long-sleeve body armor and gas masks. The markings on the suit change depending on each individual unit's assignment and rank. Elite Combine soldiers wear bright white armor with one red eye, while the majority of soldiers wear blue armor. Shotgun units wear similar armour to the standard Combine Soldier, but coloured brown with orange eyes. They are armed with a variety of firearms, including [[shotgun]]s, submachine guns, [[sniper rifle]]s and [[pulse rifle]]s. Overwatch soldiers usually operate in small groups, using squad tactics and [[grenade]]s to flush out and flank the player. They occasionally provide support to Combine synths, and often travel to areas by use of [[Dropship (science fiction)|dropships]]. They use radios to communicate with each other and with Overwatch headquarters. Combine Overwatch soldiers are usually encountered outside City 17, and only appear in the city after \"The Uprising\" near the end of ''Half-Life 2''.<ref name=\"IGNHL2enemies\"/>\n\n====Combine technology====\nThe Combine use a large array of [[science fiction]] technologies. They have access to [[teleportation]] technology, which takes them from their dimension to other dimensions. However, their teleporter technology is restrictive in comparison to that developed by [[Eli Vance]], [[Isaac Kleiner]] and [[Judith Mossman (Half Life)|Judith Mossman]] in that it cannot be used to teleport to other locations within a dimension, it can only be used to move between dimensions.<ref>{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] | date = 2004 | platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Black Mesa East| quote='''Judith Mossman''': We're closing in on a reliable local teleport technology, something the Combine still hasn't mastered. Eli thinks their models are string-based, similar to our Calabi-Yau model, but they fail to factor in the dark energy equations. They can tunnel through from their universe, but once they're here, they're dependent on local transportation.}}</ref> Throughout the games, various futuristic computer consoles, doors, power sources and weapon emplacements are encountered. In addition, the Combine employ the use of small airborne robots, scanners, to observe the citizens of Earth. The city variant merely moves about the streets, monitors individuals, and takes photographs, while the combat equivalent is capable of dropping mines into an area.<ref name=\"IGNHL2enemies\"/> Civil Protection makes use of smaller airborne robots called manhacks, which fly using razor-sharp rotating blades with which they attack their targets to cause [[laceration]] injuries. These are often deployed in closed-in areas. The Combine also use two types of [[land mine]]s; hopper mines throw themselves into the air and detonate when an enemy is detected nearby, while the spherical rollermines roll towards vehicles or other enemies, attach themselves and deliver damaging electrical attacks.<ref name=\"IGNHL2enemies\"/> Combine technology is also used to transform humans into Overwatch soldiers or stalkers, deformed and mutilated humans with no memory of their past selves who act as slaves and maintenance workers in Combine facilities. Transformation into a Stalker is considered among the Combine's worst punishments for dissidents.<ref name=\"EP1enemies\"/><ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Half-Life 2: Episode One]]|developer=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]]| date=2006|level=Direct Intervention|quote='''Alyx Vance''': Goddamn the Combine! This is what happens to you if you resist... or if you're just in the wrong place at the wrong time. [..] God, I hope you don't remember who you are...}}</ref>\n\nMilitarily, the Combine make use of both synthetics, creatures augmented with machinery, and traditional machines such as [[armored personnel carrier]]s and [[attack helicopters]].<ref name=\"IGNHL2enemies\"/> The most prominent of the synthetic machines are the insect-like [[gunship]]s; and Striders, {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} armored creatures that walk upon three legs, which are armed with a high powered warpspace cannon and a head-mounted pulse turret.<ref name=\"IGNHL2enemies\"/> In ''Episode Two'', the Hunter, a smaller equivalent to the Strider, is introduced. These 2.5&nbsp;m (8&nbsp;ft) tall, tripodal assault machines fire explosive flechettes at targets and are small enough to maneuver indoors. Other synths are seen near the end of the ''Half-Life 2'', although their roles are not elaborated on. [[Sentry gun|Sentry turrets]] are also used by the Combine.<ref name=\"IGNHL2enemies\"/> The Combine also use [[headcrab]]s as a [[biological weapon]] against dissidents, firing artillery shells loaded with the creatures into areas and allowing them to infest the vicinity.<ref name=\"IGNHL2enemies\"/>\n\n==Appearances==\n===''Half-Life'' series===\n{{expand section|Information about the Combine in Half-Life: Alyx|date=April 2020}}\nAccording to the backstory presented during ''Half-Life 2'', the Combine appear on Earth after the death of the [[Nihilanth]], the [[Boss (video games)|boss character]] at the end of ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]''. The death of the Nihilanth, a powerful creature controlling the dimensional rip between [[Xen (Half-Life)|Xen]] and the [[Black Mesa Research Facility]] on Earth, causes the rip to worsen, resulting in \"portal storms\" which spread the hostile wildlife of Xen across Earth. The Combine manipulate this tear in the spacetime continuum, widening it to allow access to Earth from their dimension. When sufficiently wide enough, the Combine launched an invasion in force. The [[United Nations Secretariat Building]] in [[New York City]] is destroyed and Earth is rapidly defeated in what became known as the Seven Hour War (the title is a reference to the Soviet military exercise [[:ru:\u0429\u0438\u0442-82|\u0429\u0438\u0442-82]]; \"Seven-Hour Nuclear War\"). Earth's surrender is negotiated by [[Wallace Breen]], who is then made the Combine's puppet administrator of Earth, and uses [[City 17]] as his base of operations.<ref name=\"BME\">{{cite web|url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2Walkthroughs.Detail&id=16&game=3|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113112249/http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2Walkthroughs.Detail&id=16&game=3|archivedate=November 13, 2012 |title=''Half-Life 2'' Walkthrough\u2014Chapter 5: Black Mesa East|work=Planet Half-Life|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Combine soldiers.png|thumb|left|Two Overwatch soldiers in ''Episode Two'', with a Hunter in the background.]]\n\nThe Combine's first appearance is in ''Half-Life 2''. Through the early stages of the game, Combine Civil Protection units pursue Gordon Freeman through City 17 after he accidentally reveals his presence to Wallace Breen. Due to Freeman's actions in ''Half-Life'', Breen sees Freeman as a major threat.<ref>{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] | date = 2004 | platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Water Hazard| quote='''Wallace Breen''': We now have direct confirmation of a disruptor in our midst, one who has acquired an almost messianic reputation in the minds of certain citizens.

And yet unsophisticated minds continue to embue him with romantic power, giving him such dangerous poetic labels as the \"One Free Man\", the \"Opener of the Way\".}}</ref> As Freeman escapes the city, Civil Protection units raid the resistance base of [[Black Mesa East]] and capture resistance leader [[Eli Vance]], who is transferred to holding facilities at [[Nova Prospekt]].<ref name=\"BME\"/> Freeman and Vance's daughter [[Alyx Vance|Alyx]] break into the facility to rescue him, but Eli Vance is teleported to the Combine Citadel by double agent [[Judith Mossman (Half Life)|Judith Mossman]].

Freeman manages to infiltrate the Citadel but is captured and taken to Breen. Mossman allows Freeman to break free of his captivity, and Breen flees to the Citadel's trans-dimensional teleporter, intent on escape. However, Freeman destroys the teleporter's reactor before Breen can escape, causing a large explosion that destroys the top of the Citadel.\n\nIn ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode One|Episode One]]'', the destruction of the teleporter at the top of the Citadel has isolated the Combine forces on Earth, but also caused its primary reactor to begin to melt down. This forces Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance to journey back into the critically damaged Citadel to temporarily stabilize its reactor while the city's inhabitants are evacuated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2Walkthroughs.Detail&id=1&game=3 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010201128/http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2Walkthroughs.Detail&id=1&game=3 |archivedate=October 10, 2012 |title=''Half-Life 2: Episode One'' Walkthrough\u2014Chapter 1: Undue Alarm |work=Planet Half-Life |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref> The Combine forces, however, instead attempt to accelerate the meltdown in order to send a message to their native universe for reinforcements.
