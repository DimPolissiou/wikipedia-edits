First at the [[Battle of the Granicus]], and then at the [[Battle of Issus]] and then finally at the [[Battle of Gaugamela]] he struck a series of blows from which the Achaemenid royal house could not recover.\n\nDuring the latter two battles Alexander had been determined to capture Darius. However, Darius had been able to escape in each of these battles. Had Alexander been able to capture Darius, it would have been extremely useful in securing the submission of the majority of the empire. Many of the Achaemenid provinces beyond [[Mesopotamia]] were prosperous and well populated.\n\nAfter Gaugamela, the Macedonians were obliged to leave the battlefield where they had been victorious almost immediately.

For the Macedonians, it was now easy to cross the Jaxartes. In all likelihood the Saka would normally have withdrawn at this point. However Alexander wanted to neutralise the threat to his borders from the nomad armies once and for all and was not about to let the enemy get away so easily. Therefore, as a second part of his strategy he ordered a battalion of mounted spear-men to advance and provoke an attack from the horse-lords. The nomads did not recognize this sacrifice for what it was. In their society, in which blood feuds were common, no commander would have sacrificed troops to obtain a better position for the main force. The families of those who had been killed would immediately start a vendetta. Alexander, on the other hand, could send his mounted spear-men on this dangerous mission because his men were well trained and understood that they were not really left alone.\n\nAlexander's vanguard was immediately surrounded and attacked by the Saka [[mounted archer]]s. Once they were engaged, their position was fixed and they were vulnerable to an approach by the Macedonian infantry and Alexander's cohorts of Cretan archers. The nomads found themselves caught between the Macedonian mounted spear-men and the rest of Alexander's army. The Saka tried to escape to the wings of the Macedonian lines, but there they were met by Alexander's infantry.\n\n[[File:Jaxartes Phase 2.png|thumb|right|Phase 2]]\n[[File:Jaxartes Phase 3.png|thumb|right|Phase 3]]\n\n==Aftermath and consequences==\n[[File:Eastern Scythian on the tomb of Xerxes I.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Saka soldier, on the tomb of [[Xerxes I]].]]\nAbout 1200 Saka were surrounded and killed, including their commander, Satraces. Over 150 prisoners were taken and 1800 horses were captured. As far as the Macedonians and Greeks knew, no commander had ever been able to pin down and destroy a nomad army besides Alexander's father, [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]]. Philip had defeated the [[Scythians|Scythian]] king [[Ateas|Atheas]] in 340 BC. This was a boost for morale, and a psychological blow for the nomads north of the Jaxartes. Alexander's main aim, however, had never been to subdue the nomads; he wanted to go to the south, where a far more serious crisis demanded his attention. He could do so now without loss of face; and in order to make the outcome acceptable to the Saka, he released the prisoners of war without ransom. This policy was successful: the northern frontier of Alexander's empire no longer faced an immediate threat from the [[Eurasian nomads]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n\n*James R.

Bjarni reportedly never made landfall there, however. Later, when travelling from Norway to Greenland, Leif was also [[blown off course]], to a land that he did not expect to see, where he found \"self-sown wheat fields and grapevines\". He next rescued two men who were shipwrecked in this country and went back to Greenland and Christianised the people there.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/voyagestovinland013593mbp/voyagestovinland013593mbp_djvu.txt archive.org]</ref> Consequently, if this is to be trusted, Bjarni Herj\u00f3lfsson was the first European to see America beyond Greenland, and the two unnamed shipwrecked men were the first people known to Europeans to have made landfall there.\n\nLeif then approached Bjarni, purchased his ship, gathered a crew of thirty-five men, and mounted an expedition towards the land Bjarni had described.<ref name=\"short34\">Short, 2010, pp. 203\u2013204.</ref> His father Erik was set to join him but dropped out after he fell from his horse on his way to set sail, an incident he interpreted as a bad omen.<ref>Somerville & McDonald, 2010, p. 352.</ref> Leif followed Bjarni's route in reverse and landed first in a rocky and desolate place he named [[Helluland]] (Flat-Rock Land; possibly [[Baffin Island]]). After venturing further by sea, he landed the second time in a forested place he named [[Markland]] (Forest Land; possibly [[Labrador]]). Finally, after two more days at sea, he landed in a verdant area with a mild climate and plentiful supplies of salmon. As winter approached, he decided to encamp there and broke his party into two groups \u2013 one to remain at camp and the other to explore the country. During one of these explorations, Tyrker discovered that the land was full of vines and grapes. Leif therefore named the land Vinland.<ref>Kudeba, N. (19 April 2014).

Bjarni reportedly never made landfall there, however. Later, when travelling from Norway to Greenland, Leif was also [[blown off course]], to a land that he did not expect to see, where he found \"self-sown wheat fields and grapevines\". He next rescued two men who were shipwrecked in this country and went back to Greenland and Christianised the people there.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/voyagestovinland013593mbp/voyagestovinland013593mbp_djvu.txt archive.org]</ref> Consequently, if this is to be trusted, Bjarni Herj\u00f3lfsson was the first European to see America beyond Greenland, and the two unnamed shipwrecked men were the first people known to Europeans to have made landfall there.\n\nLeif then approached Bjarni, purchased his ship, gathered a crew of thirty-five men, and mounted an expedition towards the land Bjarni had described.<ref name=\"short34\">Short, 2010, pp. 203\u2013204.</ref> His father Erik was set to join him but dropped out after he fell from his horse on his way to set sail, an incident he interpreted as a bad omen.<ref>Somerville & McDonald, 2010, p. 352.</ref> Leif followed Bjarni's route in reverse and landed first in a rocky and desolate place he named [[Helluland]] (Flat-Rock Land; possibly [[Baffin Island]]). After venturing further by sea, he landed the second time in a forested place he named [[Markland]] (Forest Land; possibly [[Labrador]]). Finally, after two more days at sea, he landed in a verdant area with a mild climate and plentiful supplies of salmon. As winter approached, he decided to encamp there and broke his party into two groups \u2013 one to remain at camp and the other to explore the country. During one of these explorations, Tyrker discovered that the land was full of vines and grapes. Leif therefore named the land Vinland.<ref>Kudeba, N. (19 April 2014).

Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base his choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel. A treatise on the subject, ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'', provided detailed information on selecting, equipping, sailing, seamanship, management of the paid crew, and racing such vessels. It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Power===\n[[File:WIlliam L.

The power plants started with the [[steam engine]] and transitioned to the [[internal combustion]] engine. Whereas sailing yachts continued to be steered from the after portion of the vessel, power yachts adopted the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] in a forward cabin structure that afforded better forward and sideways visibility.<ref name=\":02\" />\n==== Steam ====\nThe history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and  a [[Propeller|screw propellors]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power. With smaller, more rapidly spinning propellors engines comprised cylinders with pistons, connected to a crank shaft, driven by steam.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, [[Compound engine|compound engines]] came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis C.|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1985|volume=Vol. 2: Steam Power|location=Charlottesville}}</ref> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=\"Wiser\">{{cite book|last=Wiser|first=Wendell H.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UmMx9ixu90kC|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=2000|isbn=978-0-387-98744-6|page=190}}</ref>\n\n==== External combustion ====\nThe steam engine continued as a means of yacht propulsion until the 20th century. In the 1880s the [[naphtha engine]] made its appearance in boats. The naphtha engine is an [[external combustion engine]], where the [[working fluid]] and fuel are both [[naphtha]], which unusually is also used as a liquid fuel to power the boiler. As with a steam engine, the naphtha boils into a gas to drive a piston and then is recovered as a liquid through condensing coils.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Nehemiah|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aI5RAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover|title=New Catechism of the Steam Engine: With Chapters on Gas, Oil and Hot Air Engines|date=1904|publisher=T.

A survey of cruising sailors identified preferences for sloops, cutters, and ketches in equal measure.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Gear ===\nSailboats employ [[standing rigging]] to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Accommodations ===\n[[File:Babainterior.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht interior with fold-down table in main salon, galley (kitchen) on left, and navigation station on right and forward cabin visible beyond. The head (bathroom) is behind the wall with the table.]]\nDepending on size, a cruising yacht is likely to have at least two cabins, a main salon and a forward stateroom. In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]]. A cruising yacht is likely to have a [[Head (watercraft)|head]] (bathroom) with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank. Larger may have multiple staterooms and heads. There is typically a navigation station that allows the laying out of charts away from other activities within the vessel. The electrical panel and auxiliary instrumentation is often near this location.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref><ref name=\":9\">{{Cite book|last=DK|url=https://books.google.com/?id=s5uNcHo1PkQC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA197&dq=canting+keel|title=The Complete Sailing Manual, Third Edition|date=2011-12-19|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-7566-9760-0|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Engine ===\nCruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails.

Although wood hulls are still in production, the most common construction material is [[fibreglass]], followed by [[aluminium]], [[steel]], [[carbon fibre]], and [[ferrocement]] (rarer because of insurance difficulties). The use of wood has changed and is no longer limited to traditional board-based methods, but also include modern products such as [[plywood]], [[veneer (wood)|veneer]]s, skinned [[balsa]] and [[epoxy]] resins. Wood is mostly used by hobbyists or wooden boat purists when building an individual boat. Apart from  materials like carbon fibre and aramid fibre, spruce veneers laminated with epoxy resins have the best weight-to-strength ratios of all boatbuilding materials.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Ice yachting]]\n* [[International Sailing Federation]]\n* [[List of dinghy classes designed before 1960]]\n* [[List of keelboat classes designed before 1970]]\n* [[List of large sailing yachts]]\n* [[List of motor yachts by length]]\n* [[List of sailboat designers and manufacturers]]\n* [[Luxury yacht]]\n* [[Luxury yacht tender]]\n* [[Model yachting]]\n* [[Sailing yacht]]\n* [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]]\n* [[Olympic sailing classes]]\n* [[Yacht broker]]\n* [[Yacht charter]]\n* [[Yacht transport]]\n* [[Yachting]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n<!--<nowiki>PLEASE DO NOT TYPE FOOTNOTES HERE OR BELOW.

Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]].

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base his choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel. A treatise on the subject, ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'', provided detailed information on selecting, equipping, sailing, seamanship, management of the paid crew, and racing such vessels. It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Power===\n[[File:WIlliam L.

The power plants started with the [[steam engine]] and transitioned to the [[internal combustion]] engine. Whereas sailing yachts continued to be steered from the after portion of the vessel, power yachts adopted the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] in a forward cabin structure that afforded better forward and sideways visibility.<ref name=\":02\" />\n==== Steam ====\nThe history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and  a [[Propeller|screw propellors]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power. With smaller, more rapidly spinning propellors engines comprised cylinders with pistons, connected to a crank shaft, driven by steam.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, [[Compound engine|compound engines]] came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis C.|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1985|volume=Vol. 2: Steam Power|location=Charlottesville}}</ref> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=\"Wiser\">{{cite book|last=Wiser|first=Wendell H.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UmMx9ixu90kC|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=2000|isbn=978-0-387-98744-6|page=190}}</ref>\n\n==== External combustion ====\nThe steam engine continued as a means of yacht propulsion until the 20th century.

They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability\u2014having separate hulls far apart\u2014for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=\":6\" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft. Their drawbacks include: greater expenses, greater [[windage]], more difficult tacking under sail, less load capacity, and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam. They come with a variety of sleeping accommodations and (for catamarans) bridge-deck configurations. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Tarjan, Gregor.|title=Catamarans : the complete guide for cruising sailors|date=2008|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-159622-0|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=233534126}}</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nTraditionally, all sailing yachts were made of wood, using a wooden keel and ribs, clad with planks. These materials were supplanted with metal in specialty racing yachts. In the 1960s [[fiberglass]] became a prevalent material. These materials and others continue in use.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Howard|first=Jim|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA7&dq=Cruising+boat|title=Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising|last2=Doane|first2=Charles J.|date=2000|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-093-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n* ''Wood'' construction, using conventional planks over ribs, plywood, or the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. \n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material.\n\n=== Rigs ===\n[[Gaff rig|Gaff rigs]] have been uncommon in the construction of cruising boats, since the mid 20th century. More common rigs are [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]], [[Fractional rig|fractional]], [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], and [[ketch]]. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]]. A survey of cruising sailors identified preferences for sloops, cutters, and ketches in equal measure.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Gear ===\nSailboats employ [[standing rigging]] to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Accommodations ===\n[[File:Babainterior.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht interior with fold-down table in main salon, galley (kitchen) on left, and navigation station on right and forward cabin visible beyond. The head (bathroom) is behind the wall with the table.]]\nDepending on size, a cruising yacht is likely to have at least two cabins, a main salon and a forward stateroom. In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]]. A cruising yacht is likely to have a [[Head (watercraft)|head]] (bathroom) with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank. Larger may have multiple staterooms and heads. There is typically a navigation station that allows the laying out of charts away from other activities within the vessel. The electrical panel and auxiliary instrumentation is often near this location.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref><ref name=\":9\">{{Cite book|last=DK|url=https://books.google.com/?id=s5uNcHo1PkQC&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA197&dq=canting+keel|title=The Complete Sailing Manual, Third Edition|date=2011-12-19|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-7566-9760-0|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Engine ===\nCruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails.

Although wood hulls are still in production, the most common construction material is [[fibreglass]], followed by [[aluminium]], [[steel]], [[carbon fibre]], and [[ferrocement]] (rarer because of insurance difficulties). The use of wood has changed and is no longer limited to traditional board-based methods, but also include modern products such as [[plywood]], [[veneer (wood)|veneer]]s, skinned [[balsa]] and [[epoxy]] resins. Wood is mostly used by hobbyists or wooden boat purists when building an individual boat. Apart from  materials like carbon fibre and aramid fibre, spruce veneers laminated with epoxy resins have the best weight-to-strength ratios of all boatbuilding materials.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Ice yachting]]\n* [[International Sailing Federation]]\n* [[List of dinghy classes designed before 1960]]\n* [[List of keelboat classes designed before 1970]]\n* [[List of large sailing yachts]]\n* [[List of motor yachts by length]]\n* [[List of sailboat designers and manufacturers]]\n* [[Luxury yacht]]\n* [[Luxury yacht tender]]\n* [[Model yachting]]\n* [[Sailing yacht]]\n* [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]]\n* [[Olympic sailing classes]]\n* [[Yacht broker]]\n* [[Yacht charter]]\n* [[Yacht transport]]\n* [[Yachting]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n<!--<nowiki>PLEASE DO NOT TYPE FOOTNOTES HERE OR BELOW.

Announced as the successor to the [[PlayStation 3]] in February 2013, it was launched on November 15 in North America, November 29 in Europe, South America and Australia, and on February 22, 2014 in Japan. It's the 4th [[List of best-selling game consoles|best-selling console of all time]]. It competes with [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox One]] and [[Nintendo]]'s [[Wii U]] and [[Nintendo Switch|Switch]].\n\nMoving away from the more complex [[Cell (microprocessor)|Cell microarchitecture]] of its predecessor, the console features an [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] [[AMD Accelerated Processing Unit|Accelerated Processing Unit]] (APU) built upon the [[x86-64]] architecture, which can theoretically peak at 1.84 [[teraflops]]; AMD stated that it was the \"most powerful\" APU it had developed to date. The PlayStation 4 places an increased emphasis on social interaction and integration with other devices and services, including the ability to play games off-console on [[PlayStation Vita]] and other supported devices (\"[[Remote Play]]\"), the ability to [[Screencast|stream]] gameplay online or to friends, with them controlling gameplay remotely (\"Share Play\"). The console's [[DualShock#DualShock 4|controller]] was also redesigned and improved over the PlayStation 3, with improved buttons and analog sticks, and an integrated [[touchpad]] among other changes. The console also supports [[HDR10]] [[High-dynamic-range video]] and playback of [[4K resolution]] multimedia.\n\nThe PlayStation 4 was released to critical acclaim, with critics praising Sony for acknowledging its consumers' needs, embracing [[independent game development]], and for not imposing the restrictive [[digital rights management]] schemes like those originally announced by Microsoft for the Xbox One. Critics and third-party studios also praised the capabilities of the PlayStation 4 in comparison to its competitors; developers described the performance difference between the console and Xbox One as \"significant\" and \"obvious\".<ref name=\"edge\" /> Heightened demand also helped Sony top global console sales. By the end of September 2019, over 102 million PlayStation 4 consoles had been shipped worldwide, surpassing lifetime sales of the PlayStation 3.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.destructoid.com/the-ps4-has-finally-overtaken-the-ps3-in-sony-s-latest-financial-report-515027.phtml|title=The PS4 has finally overtaken the PS3 in Sony's latest financial report|date=July 31, 2018|work=Destructoid|access-date=July 31, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nOn September 7, 2016, Sony unveiled the PlayStation 4 Slim, a smaller version of the console; and a high-end version called the PlayStation 4 Pro, which features an upgraded GPU and a higher CPU [[clock rate]] to support enhanced performance and 4K resolution in supported games.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://gamerant.com/sony-ps4-pro-4k-console/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=June 18, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190618123447/https://gamerant.com/sony-ps4-pro-4k-console/ |archive-date=June 18, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:The PlayStation 4.

It is a revision of the original PS4 hardware with a smaller form factor; it has a rounded body with a matte finish on the top of the console rather than a two-tone finish, and is 40% smaller in size than the original model. The two USB ports on the front have been updated to the newer USB 3.1 standard and have a larger gap between them, and the optical audio port was removed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2016-hands-on-with-the-playstation-4-slim-cuh-2000|title=Digital Foundry: Hands-on with the CUH-2000 PS4 Slim|work=Eurogamer.net|access-date=April 25, 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180314013136/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2016-hands-on-with-the-playstation-4-slim-cuh-2000|archive-date=March 14, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> This model also features support for [[USB 3.1]], [[Bluetooth 4.0]] and 5.0&nbsp;GHz Wi-Fi.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps4-vs-ps4-pro-vs-ps4-slim-what-are-the-difference/1100-6456440/|title=PS4 Vs PS4 Pro Vs PS4 Slim: What Are The Differences And Which PlayStation Console Should You Buy?|last=Thang|first=Jimmy|date=February 23, 2018|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=January 8, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190108100900/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps4-vs-ps4-pro-vs-ps4-slim-what-are-the-difference/1100-6456440/|archive-date=January 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIt was released on September 15, 2016, with a 500&nbsp;GB model at the same price as the original version of the PlayStation 4.<ref name=\"ars-ps4slim\">{{cite web |title=PS4 Slim: A smaller, sexier console with surprisingly few compromises |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/09/ps4-slim-review-2/ |website=Ars Technica |accessdate=September 7, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160907203338/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/09/ps4-slim-review-2/ |archive-date=September 7, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> On April 18, 2017, Sony announced that it had replaced this base model with a 1&nbsp;TB version at the same MSRP.<ref name=\"verge-1tbslim\">{{cite web |title=Sony's PS4 Slim now comes with a 1TB hard drive for the same price |url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/4/18/15344360/sony-ps4-slim-1tb-hard-drive-announced |website=The Verge |publisher=Vox Media |accessdate=April 19, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419112328/http://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/4/18/15344360/sony-ps4-slim-1tb-hard-drive-announced |archive-date=April 19, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== PlayStation 4 Pro ===\n[[File:Sony-PlayStation4-Pro-Console-FL.jpg|link=File:Sony-PlayStation4-Pro-Console-FL.jpg|thumb|right|The PlayStation 4 Pro]]\n'''PlayStation 4 Pro''' (codenamed '''Neo''', model number CUH-7000)<ref name=\"PS4Neo\" /> was announced on September 7, 2016, and launched worldwide on November 10, 2016.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Layden |first1=Shawn |title=PlayStation 4 Pro Launches Today |url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2016/11/10/playstation-4-pro-launches-today/ |website=blog.us.playstation.com |accessdate=November 10, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111062512/http://blog.us.playstation.com/2016/11/10/playstation-4-pro-launches-today/ |archive-date=November 11, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=ps4pro_model_no>{{cite web |url=http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2016/09/07/new-official-ps4-peripherals-announced-includes-new-dualshock-4-ps-camera-and-headset/#/slide/1 |title=New Official PS4 Peripherals Announced, Includes New DualShock 4, PS Camera and Headset |author=Co, Alex |date=September 7, 2016 |website=PlayStation Lifestyle |access-date=September 8, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160908170320/http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2016/09/07/new-official-ps4-peripherals-announced-includes-new-dualshock-4-ps-camera-and-headset/#/slide/1 |archive-date=September 8, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> It is an upgraded version of the PlayStation 4 with improved hardware to enable [[4K resolution|4K]] rendering and improved [[PlayStation VR]] performance, including an upgraded GPU with 4.2 [[teraflop]]s of processing power and hardware support for [[checkerboard rendering]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/10/20/ps4-pro-mark-cerny-interview-hardware/ |title=The PS4 Pro, as explained by the man who designed it |author=Conditt, Jessica |date=September 7, 2016 |website=Engadget |access-date=January 1, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231074745/https://www.engadget.com/2016/10/20/ps4-pro-mark-cerny-interview-hardware/ |archive-date=December 31, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> and a higher CPU clock.

The most prominent technique used is checkerboard rendering, wherein the console only renders portions of a scene using a checkerboard pattern, and then uses algorithms to fill in the non-rendered segments. The checkerboarded screen can then be smoothed using an anti-aliasing filter. Hermen Hulst of [[Guerrilla Games]] explained that PS4 Pro could render something \"perceptively so close [to 4K] that you wouldn't be able to see the difference\".<ref name=\"eg-4kanalysis\">{{cite web |title=Tech Analysis: 4K gaming on PlayStation 4 Pro |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2016-4k-gaming-on-ps4-pro-tech-analysis |website=Eurogamer |accessdate=April 6, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407145124/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2016-4k-gaming-on-ps4-pro-tech-analysis |archive-date=April 7, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"vb-not4k\">{{cite web |title=PlayStation 4 Pro is not a real 4K console |url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/09/08/ps4-pro-isnt-4k-that-doesnt-matter/ |website=VentureBeat |accessdate=April 6, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407150007/https://venturebeat.com/2016/09/08/ps4-pro-isnt-4k-that-doesnt-matter/ |archive-date=April 7, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"engadget-prointerview\">{{cite web |title=The PS4 Pro, as explained by the man who designed it |url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/10/20/ps4-pro-mark-cerny-interview-hardware/ |website=Engadget |accessdate=April 6, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214181639/https://www.engadget.com/2016/10/20/ps4-pro-mark-cerny-interview-hardware/ |archive-date=February 14, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nPS4 Pro supports Remote Play, Share Play, and streaming at up to 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second, as well as capturing screenshots at 2160p, and 1080p video at 30 frames per second.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/9/7/12842868/ps4-pro-share-grabs-4k-screens-caps-1080p-video |title=PS4 Pro \"Share\" grabs 4K screens, caps 1080p video |last= |first= |date=September 7, 2016 |website=Polygon |publisher=Vox Media |access-date=November 17, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117211124/http://www.polygon.com/2016/9/7/12842868/ps4-pro-share-grabs-4k-screens-caps-1080p-video |archive-date=November 17, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn late-2017, Sony issued a new PS4 Pro revision (model number CUH-7100) that featured updated internal components. The actual hardware specifications and performance remained the same as the original model, although it was found that the revised console has a slightly quieter fan profile than the original (and as a result, operating at a slightly higher temperature under load than the CUH-7000). In October 2018, Sony quietly issued another revision (model number CUH-7200), initially as part of ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'' hardware bundles. The revision has a different power supply which uses the same type of cord as the \"Slim\" model, and was shown to have further improvements to acoustics.<ref>{{Cite

Announced as the successor to the [[PlayStation 3]] in February 2013, it was launched on November 15 in North America, November 29 in Europe, South America and Australia, and on February 22, 2014 in Japan. It's the 4th [[List of best-selling game consoles|best-selling console of all time]]. It competes with [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox One]] and [[Nintendo]]'s [[Wii U]] and [[Nintendo Switch|Switch]].\n\nMoving away from the more complex [[Cell (microprocessor)|Cell microarchitecture]] of its predecessor, the console features an [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] [[AMD Accelerated Processing Unit|Accelerated Processing Unit]] (APU) built upon the [[x86-64]] architecture, which can theoretically peak at 1.84 [[teraflops]]; AMD stated that it was the \"most powerful\" APU it had developed to date. The PlayStation 4 places an increased emphasis on social interaction and integration with other devices and services, including the ability to play games off-console on [[PlayStation Vita]] and other supported devices (\"[[Remote Play]]\"), the ability to [[Screencast|stream]] gameplay online or to friends, with them controlling gameplay remotely (\"Share Play\"). The console's [[DualShock#DualShock 4|controller]] was also redesigned and improved over the PlayStation 3, with improved buttons and analog sticks, and an integrated [[touchpad]] among other changes. The console also supports [[HDR10]] [[High-dynamic-range video]] and playback of [[4K resolution]] multimedia.\n\nThe PlayStation 4 was released to critical acclaim, with critics praising Sony for acknowledging its consumers' needs, embracing [[independent game development]], and for not imposing the restrictive [[digital rights management]] schemes like those originally announced by Microsoft for the Xbox One. Critics and third-party studios also praised the capabilities of the PlayStation 4 in comparison to its competitors; developers described the performance difference between the console and Xbox One as \"significant\" and \"obvious\".<ref name=\"edge\" /> Heightened demand also helped Sony top global console sales. By the end of September 2019, over 102 million PlayStation 4 consoles had been shipped worldwide, surpassing lifetime sales of the PlayStation 3.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.destructoid.com/the-ps4-has-finally-overtaken-the-ps3-in-sony-s-latest-financial-report-515027.phtml|title=The PS4 has finally overtaken the PS3 in Sony's latest financial report|date=July 31, 2018|work=Destructoid|access-date=July 31, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nOn September 7, 2016, Sony unveiled the PlayStation 4 Slim, a smaller version of the console; and a high-end version called the PlayStation 4 Pro, which features an upgraded GPU and a higher CPU [[clock rate]] to support enhanced performance and 4K resolution in supported games.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://gamerant.com/sony-ps4-pro-4k-console/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=June 18, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190618123447/https://gamerant.com/sony-ps4-pro-4k-console/ |archive-date=June 18, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:The PlayStation 4.

Successive models have added or removed various features, and each model has variations of Limited Edition consoles.\n\n=== PlayStation 4 Slim ===\n[[File:PS4 black sample, Taipei IT Month 20171209.jpg|thumb|right|The PlayStation 4 Slim model]]\n[[File:Sony PlayStation 4 Slim.jpg|thumb|right|The PlayStation 4 Slim with DualShock 4 controller]]\nOn September 7, 2016, Sony announced a hardware revision of PlayStation 4, model number CUH-2000, known colloquially as the '''PlayStation 4 Slim'''. It is a revision of the original PS4 hardware with a smaller form factor; it has a rounded body with a matte finish on the top of the console rather than a two-tone finish, and is 40% smaller in size than the original model. The two USB ports on the front have been updated to the newer USB 3.1 standard and have a larger gap between them, and the optical audio port was removed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2016-hands-on-with-the-playstation-4-slim-cuh-2000|title=Digital Foundry: Hands-on with the CUH-2000 PS4 Slim|work=Eurogamer.net|access-date=April 25, 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180314013136/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2016-hands-on-with-the-playstation-4-slim-cuh-2000|archive-date=March 14, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> This model also features support for [[USB 3.1]], [[Bluetooth 4.0]] and 5.0&nbsp;GHz Wi-Fi.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps4-vs-ps4-pro-vs-ps4-slim-what-are-the-difference/1100-6456440/|title=PS4 Vs PS4 Pro Vs PS4 Slim: What Are The Differences And Which PlayStation Console Should You Buy?|last=Thang|first=Jimmy|date=February 23, 2018|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=January 8, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190108100900/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps4-vs-ps4-pro-vs-ps4-slim-what-are-the-difference/1100-6456440/|archive-date=January 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIt was released on September 15, 2016, with a 500&nbsp;GB model at the same price as the original version of the PlayStation 4.<ref name=\"ars-ps4slim\">{{cite web |title=PS4 Slim: A smaller, sexier console with surprisingly few compromises |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/09/ps4-slim-review-2/ |website=Ars Technica |accessdate=September 7, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160907203338/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/09/ps4-slim-review-2/ |archive-date=September 7, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> On April 18, 2017, Sony announced that it had replaced this base model with a 1&nbsp;TB version at the same MSRP.<ref name=\"verge-1tbslim\">{{cite web |title=Sony's PS4 Slim now comes with a 1TB hard drive for the same price |url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/4/18/15344360/sony-ps4-slim-1tb-hard-drive-announced |website=The Verge |publisher=Vox Media |accessdate=April 19, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419112328/http://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/4/18/15344360/sony-ps4-slim-1tb-hard-drive-announced |archive-date=April 19, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== PlayStation 4 Pro ===\n[[File:Sony-PlayStation4-Pro-Console-FL.jpg|link=File:Sony-PlayStation4-Pro-Console-FL.jpg|thumb|right|The PlayStation 4 Pro]]\n'''PlayStation 4 Pro''' (codenamed '''Neo''', model number CUH-7000)<ref name=\"PS4Neo\" /> was announced on September 7, 2016, and launched worldwide on November 10, 2016.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Layden |first1=Shawn |title=PlayStation 4 Pro Launches Today |url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2016/11/10/playstation-4-pro-launches-today/ |website=blog.us.playstation.com |accessdate=November 10, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111062512/http://blog.us.playstation.com/2016/11/10/playstation-4-pro-launches-today/ |archive-date=November 11, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=ps4pro_model_no>{{cite web |url=http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2016/09/07/new-official-ps4-peripherals-announced-includes-new-dualshock-4-ps-camera-and-headset/#/slide/1 |title=New Official PS4 Peripherals Announced, Includes New DualShock 4, PS Camera and Headset |author=Co, Alex |date=September 7, 2016 |website=PlayStation Lifestyle |access-date=September 8, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160908170320/http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2016/09/07/new-official-ps4-peripherals-announced-includes-new-dualshock-4-ps-camera-and-headset/#/slide/1 |archive-date=September 8, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> It is an upgraded version of the PlayStation 4 with improved hardware to enable [[4K resolution|4K]] rendering and improved [[PlayStation VR]] performance, including an upgraded GPU with 4.2 [[teraflop]]s of processing power and hardware support for [[checkerboard rendering]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/10/20/ps4-pro-mark-cerny-interview-hardware/ |title=The PS4 Pro, as explained by the man who designed it |author=Conditt, Jessica |date=September 7, 2016 |website=Engadget |access-date=January 1, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231074745/https://www.engadget.com/2016/10/20/ps4-pro-mark-cerny-interview-hardware/ |archive-date=December 31, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> and a higher CPU clock.

The most prominent technique used is checkerboard rendering, wherein the console only renders portions of a scene using a checkerboard pattern, and then uses algorithms to fill in the non-rendered segments. The checkerboarded screen can then be smoothed using an anti-aliasing filter. Hermen Hulst of [[Guerrilla Games]] explained that PS4 Pro could render something \"perceptively so close [to 4K] that you wouldn't be able to see the difference\".<ref name=\"eg-4kanalysis\">{{cite web |title=Tech Analysis: 4K gaming on PlayStation 4 Pro |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2016-4k-gaming-on-ps4-pro-tech-analysis |website=Eurogamer |accessdate=April 6, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407145124/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2016-4k-gaming-on-ps4-pro-tech-analysis |archive-date=April 7, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"vb-not4k\">{{cite web |title=PlayStation 4 Pro is not a real 4K console |url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/09/08/ps4-pro-isnt-4k-that-doesnt-matter/ |website=VentureBeat |accessdate=April 6, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407150007/https://venturebeat.com/2016/09/08/ps4-pro-isnt-4k-that-doesnt-matter/ |archive-date=April 7, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"engadget-prointerview\">{{cite web |title=The PS4 Pro, as explained by the man who designed it |url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/10/20/ps4-pro-mark-cerny-interview-hardware/ |website=Engadget |accessdate=April 6, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214181639/https://www.engadget.com/2016/10/20/ps4-pro-mark-cerny-interview-hardware/ |archive-date=February 14, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nPS4 Pro supports Remote Play, Share Play, and streaming at up to 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second, as well as capturing screenshots at 2160p, and 1080p video at 30 frames per second.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/9/7/12842868/ps4-pro-share-grabs-4k-screens-caps-1080p-video |title=PS4 Pro \"Share\" grabs 4K screens, caps 1080p video |last= |first= |date=September 7, 2016 |website=Polygon |publisher=Vox Media |access-date=November 17, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117211124/http://www.polygon.com/2016/9/7/12842868/ps4-pro-share-grabs-4k-screens-caps-1080p-video |archive-date=November 17, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn late-2017, Sony issued a new PS4 Pro revision (model number CUH-7100) that featured updated internal components. The actual hardware specifications and performance remained the same as the original model, although it was found that the revised console has a slightly quieter fan profile than the original (and as a result, operating at a slightly higher temperature under load than the CUH-7000). In October 2018, Sony quietly issued another revision (model number CUH-7200), initially as part of ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'' hardware bundles. The revision has a different power supply which uses the same type of cord as the \"Slim\" model, and was shown to have further improvements to acoustics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2018-playstation-4-pro-cuh-7200-review|title=PlayStation 4 Pro CUH-7200 review: the latest, quietest hardware revision|last=Leadbetter|first=Richard|date=November 7, 2018|website=Eurogamer|language=en|access-date=January 7, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190107030802/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2018-playstation-4-pro-cuh-7200-review|archive-date=January 7, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dualshockers.com/playstation-pro-hardware-update/|title=PS4 Pro Gets Minor Hardware Update, Changing Model to CUH-7100|date=October 3, 2017|work=DualShockers|access-date=November 10, 2018|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181110120122/https://www.dualshockers.com/playstation-pro-hardware-update/|archive-date=November 10, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.4gamer.net/games/990/G999024/20171003022/|title=PS4 Pro Jet Black model number changed to \"CUH -

Valdez was not totally destroyed, but after three years, the town relocated to higher ground {{convert|4|mi|spell=in|||}} west of its original site. Some [[Alaska Native]] villages, including [[Chenega, Alaska|Chenega]] and [[Afognak, Alaska|Afognak]], were destroyed or damaged. The earthquake caused the [[Cold war era|Cold-War era]] [[ballistic missile]] detection radar of [[Clear Air Force Station]] to go offline for six minutes, the only unscheduled interruption in its operational history. Near [[Cordova, Alaska|Cordova]], the [[Miles Glacier Bridge|Million Dollar Bridge]] crossing the [[Copper River (Alaska)|Copper River]] also suffered damage, with Span #4 slipping off its pylon and collapsing. The community of [[Girdwood, Anchorage|Girdwood]] was also confined to the southern side of the Seward Highway when water rushed into Turnagain Arm and flooded or destroyed any buildings left standing to the north of the highway. Only the ground immediately along the highway and that on the north side of the road dropped, prompting geologists to speculate that Girdwood may rest upon an ancient cliff face, now covered by countless thousands of years of sediment and glacial deposits.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n===Canada===\nA 4.5&nbsp;ft (1.4 m) wave reached [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia]], just south of the [[Alaska Panhandle]], about three hours after the earthquake.

It was severely damaged in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005, and in hurricane events in 2011.\n\n==History==\nThe name ''\"Plaquemines,\"'' in French Creole, was derived from the [[Atakapa]] word, ''piakimin'', meaning the local fruit [[persimmon]]. The French used it to name a military post they built on the banks of the [[Mississippi River]], as the site was surrounded by numerous persimmon trees. Eventually the name was applied to the entire parish and to a nearby [[bayou]].\n\nThe oldest European settlement in the parish was [[La Balize, Louisiana|La Balize]], where the French built and inhabited a crude fort by 1699 near the mouth of the Mississippi River. The name in French meant \"seamark\", a tall structure of wood built as a guide for ships.  By 1721 the French built one {{convert|62|ft|m}} high.<ref>[http://www.srh.noaa.gov/lch/research/la18hu.php#18 David Roth, \"Louisiana Hurricane History: 18th Century (1722-1800)\", Tropical Weather - National Weather Service - Lake Charles, LA; 24 Jun 2003], accessed 7 May 2008</ref>  A surviving map from about 1720 shows the island and fort, and the mouth of the river.<ref>[http://www.crt.state.la.us/louisiana-state-museum/search-and-reference/historic-map-database/view-map?ViewID=2182 \"Carte du Fleuve Saint Louis ou Mississippy dix lieues au dessous de la Novelle Orleans jusqu'a son Embouchoure\"], Louisiana State Museum Map Database, originally accessed 6 May 2008, only catalog entry available online 4 April 2016</ref>\n\nAs traffic and trade on the river increased, so did the importance of river pilots who were knowledgeable about the complicated, ever-changing currents and sandbars in the river.  They lived at La Balize with their families.  The village was destroyed and rebuilt numerous times, but it was abandoned for good after being destroyed by a September 1860 hurricane.  The pilots moved upriver and built the settlement they named [[Pilottown]], which reached its peak of population in the 19th century.<ref>[http://www.srh.noaa.gov/lch/research/lalate19hu.php David Roth, \"Louisiana Hurricane History: Late 19th Century (1851-1900)\"], Tropical Weather - National Weather Service - Lake Charles, LA; Jun 2003, accessed 6 May 2008</ref> The river pilots' expertise continues to be critical, but now they generally live with their families in more populated areas. They stay at Pilottown temporarily for work.\n\nAn important historical site is [[Fort Jackson, Louisiana|Fort Jackson]], built in 1822 as recommended by General [[Andrew Jackson]], hero of the [[Battle of New Orleans]] in the [[War of 1812]]. In 1861, Fort Jackson served as an important [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] defense for the city of New Orleans during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] because it was at the mouth of the Mississippi River. The US Army used it as a training base during [[World War I]], 1917-1918.\n\nPlaquemines is one of only two parishes that have kept their same boundaries from the beginning of Louisiana's parishes in 1807 to today, the other being [[St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana|St. Bernard Parish]].\n\n==20th century to present==\nBecause Plaquemines Parish encompasses the last {{convert|70|mi|km}} of the Mississippi River before it reaches the Gulf of Mexico, it is the site of several oil refineries, which rely on the shipping lanes for moving their product. The [[Mississippi River Delta]] of Plaquemines is also a base for assistance to offshore oil rigs. Plaquemines Parish was the first place in the United States where shippers used a [[Intermodal container|container]] for cargo in foreign trade. The area is also known for having the southernmost point in Louisiana, at just under 29 degrees north.\n\nThe [[1901 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Four|August 1901 Hurricane]] caused damage, including 4 feet of water in [[Buras, Louisiana|Buras]].<ref>[http://www.thecajuns.com/lahurricanes.htm \"Louisiana Hurricanes\"], The Cajuns</ref>\n\nThe [[1915 New Orleans Hurricane|Great Hurricane of 1915]] devastated much of the parish, with multiple [[levee]] breaches on both sides of the Mississippi, a 12-foot [[storm surge]], and hundreds of deaths. Homelessness was widespread, and many people were reduced to starvation until charitable aid arrived.<ref>[http://files.usgwarchives.net/la/plaquemines/history/hurc1915.txt \"Hurricane of 1915: Plaquemines Parish History\"]</ref> The old Parish Courthouse in Pointe \u00e0 la Hache was among the many buildings destroyed in the storm, but a new one was completed within the year.\n\nIn the early 1900s, Plaquemines was an exporter of citrus. Farmers used the railroads and the Mississippi to ship the large annual harvest to markets.  Commercial fisheries, especially for oysters, have been important in the parish economy.\n\nFrom 1924 to 1969, Plaquemines and [[St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana|St. Bernard]] parishes were effectively the domain of the [[political boss]] [[Leander Perez]], who established a strong hold over the area.<ref name=\"Jeansonne\">Glen Jeansonne, ''Leander Perez: Boss of the Delta'' {{ISBN|1604736372}}</ref> He was notorious for fixing elections and enforcing strict [[racial segregation]]. Upon his death, his sons Leander Perez, Jr., and Chalin O. Perez were elected as the dominant political figures of the parish as district attorney and parish president, respectively.  Interpersonal feuding weakened the family's hold on power. After another decade, by 1980 political opponents had begun to win local elections.<ref name=\"Jeansonne\"/>\n\nIn 1969, [[Hurricane Camille]] devastated portions of Plaquemines Parish. Storm surge over 10 feet, winds over 100 miles per hour, and peak pressure at 941 hPa devastated [[Buras, Louisiana]], [[Venice, Louisiana]], and many more towns and cities.\n\nDuring the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]], city and state leaders used [[dynamite]] to breach a [[levee]] at [[Caernarvon, Louisiana|Caernarvon]], thirteen miles (19&nbsp;km) below Canal Street, in order to save the city of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] from flooding. This action resulted in the flooding of much of the less-populated St. Bernard and Plaquemines parishes, causing widespread destruction to agriculture and housing.\n\nThe Civil Rights struggle for African-Americans to become registered voters in Plaquemines Parish begin in October 1946, under the guidance of Dr. Rev. Percy Murphy Griffin. With the aid of Attorneys Earl Amedee and [[Louis Berry]] from New Orleans, Griffin and twenty-six African-Americans from Plaquemines Parish organized the Plaquemines Parish Civil and Political Organization, Inc., to fight racial barriers established by Perez. In the summer of 1953, the group organized a voter registration drive for African Americans. In 1954, [[Irene Griffin (activist)|Irene Griffin]] became the first black woman to register to vote in the parish.<ref name=\"Irene Griffin Nola\">{{cite news |title=Irene Griffin, first black woman to register to vote in Plaquemines Parish, dies at 84 |url=https://duckduckgo.com/?q=first+black+woman+to+vote&atb=v120-6__&ia=web |accessdate=29 December 2018 |newspaper=New Orleans Times-Picayune |date=29 March 2012 |quote=Mrs. Griffin was an ardent supporter of her husband's efforts to take on segregationist Judge Leander Perez Sr. When the Rev.

In 1966, the organization led the fight to integrate public schools. The movement also worked to get Seymourville and another small community included within the parish boundaries; the city had sought to exclude these majority-black communities to prevent black votes from being counted.<ref>[http://www.thirteen.org/thirteen-fifty-years/videos/louisiana-diary/ ''Louisiana Diary''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803043507/http://www.thirteen.org/thirteen-fifty-years/videos/louisiana-diary/ |date=2014-08-03 }}, 16 March 1964, Written, directed and narrated by Richard O.

Leander Perez sealed off the parish to control the distribution of state assistance.<ref>Jeansonne; ''Leander Perez'', p. 354</ref>\n\nIt is estimated that without significant human intervention, Plaquemines Parish will lose 55% of its current land to rising sea levels over the next 50 years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/08/us/fema-disaster-recovery-climate-change.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage|title=As Storms Keep Coming, FEMA Spends Billions in \u2018Cycle\u2019 of Damage and Repair|access-date=2018-10-09|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Historic sites===\n{{Main|National Register of Historic Places listings in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana}}\n\nThe parish includes three United States [[National Historic Landmarks]]:\n* [[Fort De La Boulaye Site]],\n* [[Fort Jackson, Louisiana|Fort Jackson]], and\n* [[Fort St. Philip]].\nThe parish has five other sites listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], including [[Woodland Plantation (West Pointe a la Hache, Louisiana)|Woodland Plantation]], which has been depicted on the label of [[Southern Comfort]] liqueur since the 1930s.

The [[storm surge]] which flowed in was more than 20 feet (6.1 m) high. Although a majority of the populace had complied with mandatory state evacuation orders, some did not, possibly because they were not able to. At least three people died.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the parish has a total area of {{convert|2567|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|780|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|1787|sqmi}} (70%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_22.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=August 20, 2014|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928155956/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_22.txt|archivedate=September 28, 2013}}</ref> It is the largest parish by total area in Louisiana.

About 15.40% of families and 18.00% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 20.70% of those under age 18 and 18.40% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==Economy==\nPlaquemines has a significant seafood industry. The parish exports millions of pounds of shrimp, crab, oysters, and fish annually. Plaquemines also has a vibrant citrus industry. The seafood and citrus industries have suffered somewhat in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. About half the shrimping and shellfish fleet were lost. In January 2007, thousands of citrus trees went unpicked.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\nAs of 2012, Plaquemines parish is the largest crude-oil producing parish in Louisiana.

The Plaquemines Port, Harbor & Terminal District is coextensive with the parish. It was created in 1954 by the legislature of Louisiana as a state agency.  It is governed by a committee of the Plaquemines Parish Council, acting as the Port Board.<ref>[http://www.portofplaquemines.com/history.html \"History\"], Plaquemines Port Harbor & Terminal District website</ref>\n\n===Alternative energy===\nOil and gas continue to play a dominant role in the Plaquemines economy; however, there is a growing policy and resource trend in favor of [[renewable resources]]. The Parish government is working with public and private partners to invest in renewable energy, including [[hydrokinetic energy]] and [[wind energy]]. Plaquemines has a huge potential for hydrokinetic energy sites along deep bends in the Mississippi River.  The flow of the river is 470,000 cubic feet per second at the [[Head of Passes]] during normal river stages and 1,250,000 during peak times.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lacoast.gov/new/about/Basin_data/mr/Default.aspx|title=The Mississippi River Delta Basin|website=lacoast.gov|access-date=2018-03-06}}</ref> Tidal turbines would be placed in deep bends of the river below seagoing and barge traffic.

Wind Power Densities are divided into seven Wind Power Classes. According to the American Wind Energy Association, Plaquemines has winds in specified areas that fall into a Wind Power Class of seven, which makes the Parish a particularly attractive location for wind turbine investment. Wind turbines would likely be placed at the mouth of the Mississippi, where winds are the strongest. \nWind Energy Systems Technology has proposed to build a 12.5 MV wind farm in [[Barataria Bay]] off the coast of Plaquemines Parish. The energy would be sent to Myrtle Gove through an underground cable. The wind farm would be supplemented with natural gas turbines when wind speeds are either not sufficient or too robust to supply power. A similar proposal is being considered for the southern portion of the Parish.\n\n==Education==\n[[Plaquemines Parish School Board]] operates the public schools of the parish.\n\n==Communities==\n[[Image:Map of Plaquemines Parish Louisiana With Municipal Labels.PNG|thumb|300px|Map of Plaquemines Parish with municipal labels]]\nThere are no incorporated areas within Plaquemines Parish.\nCommunities not listed below include Dalcour, Myrtle Grove, Nairn, Naomi, Orchid, and Scarsdale.\n\n===Census-designated places===\n{{div col}}\n* [[Belle Chasse, Louisiana|Belle Chasse]]\n* [[Boothville, Louisiana|Boothville]]\n* [[Buras, Louisiana|Buras]]\n* [[Empire, Louisiana|Empire]]\n* [[Pointe \u00e0 la Hache, Louisiana|Pointe \u00e0 la Hache]] '''(parish seat)'''\n* [[Port Sulphur, Louisiana|Port Sulphur]]\n* [[Triumph, Louisiana|Triumph]]\n* [[Venice, Louisiana|Venice]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Unincorporated communities===\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Bohemia, Louisiana|Bohemia]]\n* [[Braithwaite, Louisiana|Braithwaite]]\n* [[Carlisle, Louisiana|Carlisle]]\n* [[Dalcour, Louisiana|Dalcour]]\n* [[Davant, Louisiana|Davant]]\n* [[Duvic, Louisiana|Duvic]]\n* [[Grand Ecaille, Louisiana|Grand Ecaille]]\n* [[Grand Isle, Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana|Grand Isle]]\n* [[Ironton, Louisiana|Ironton]]\n* [[Jesuit Bend, Louisiana|Jesuit Bend]]\n* [[Orchid, Louisiana|Orchid]]\n* [[Phoenix, Louisiana|Phoenix]]\n* [[Pilottown, Louisiana|Pilottown]]\n* [[Port Eads, Louisiana|Port Eads]]\n* [[West Pointe \u00e0 la Hache, Louisiana|West Pointe \u00e0 la Hache]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Outdated designations===\n* [[Boothville-Venice, Louisiana|Boothville-Venice]]\n* [[Buras-Triumph, Louisiana|Buras-Triumph]]\n\n===Ghost towns===\n* [[Burrwood, Louisiana|Burrwood]]\n* [[La Balize, Louisiana|La Balize]]\n\n==Notable people==\n* [[Dan Alexander (offensive lineman)|Dan Alexander]]\n* [[Billy Nungesser]]\n* [[Leander Perez]]\n* [[Chris Henry (wide receiver)|Chris Henry]]\n\n==Politics==\nPlaquemines Parish was for a long time controlled by the notorious political boss [[Leander Perez]], who turned the parish\u2019s voters away from the National Democratic Party with the [[Dixiecrat]] bolt in 1948.<ref>Jeansonne; ''Leander Perez'', p. 194</ref> The parish has been solidly anti-Democratic and at times overwhelmingly so at a Presidential level since 1948, with the only Democratic nominee subsequently to carry the parish being [[Bill Clinton]] in 1996.

It was severely damaged in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005, and in hurricane events in 2011.\n\n==History==\nThe name ''\"Plaquemines,\"'' in French Creole, was derived from the [[Atakapa]] word, ''piakimin'', meaning the local fruit [[persimmon]]. The French used it to name a military post they built on the banks of the [[Mississippi River]], as the site was surrounded by numerous persimmon trees. Eventually the name was applied to the entire parish and to a nearby [[bayou]].\n\nThe oldest European settlement in the parish was [[La Balize, Louisiana|La Balize]], where the French built and inhabited a crude fort by 1699 near the mouth of the Mississippi River. The name in French meant \"seamark\", a tall structure of wood built as a guide for ships.  By 1721 the French built one {{convert|62|ft|m}} high.<ref>[http://www.srh.noaa.gov/lch/research/la18hu.php#18 David Roth, \"Louisiana Hurricane History: 18th Century (1722-1800)\", Tropical Weather - National Weather Service - Lake Charles, LA; 24 Jun 2003], accessed 7 May 2008</ref>  A surviving map from about 1720 shows the island and fort, and the mouth of the river.<ref>[http://www.crt.state.la.us/louisiana-state-museum/search-and-reference/historic-map-database/view-map?ViewID=2182 \"Carte du Fleuve Saint Louis ou Mississippy dix lieues au dessous de la Novelle Orleans jusqu'a son Embouchoure\"], Louisiana State Museum Map Database, originally accessed 6 May 2008, only catalog entry available online 4 April 2016</ref>\n\nAs traffic and trade on the river increased, so did the importance of river pilots who were knowledgeable about the complicated, ever-changing currents and sandbars in the river.  They lived at La Balize with their families.  The village was destroyed and rebuilt numerous times, but it was abandoned for good after being destroyed by a September 1860 hurricane.  The pilots moved upriver and built the settlement they named [[Pilottown]], which reached its peak of population in the 19th century.<ref>[http://www.srh.noaa.gov/lch/research/lalate19hu.php David Roth, \"Louisiana Hurricane History: Late 19th Century (1851-1900)\"], Tropical Weather - National Weather Service - Lake Charles, LA; Jun 2003, accessed 6 May 2008</ref> The river pilots' expertise continues to be critical, but now they generally live with their families in more populated areas. They stay at Pilottown temporarily for work.\n\nAn important historical site is [[Fort Jackson, Louisiana|Fort Jackson]], built in 1822 as recommended by General [[Andrew Jackson]], hero of the [[Battle of New Orleans]] in the [[War of 1812]]. In 1861, Fort Jackson served as an important [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] defense for the city of New Orleans during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] because it was at the mouth of the Mississippi River. The US Army used it as a training base during [[World War I]], 1917-1918.\n\nPlaquemines is one of only two parishes that have kept their same boundaries from the beginning of Louisiana's parishes in 1807 to today, the other being [[St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana|St. Bernard Parish]].\n\n==20th century to present==\nBecause Plaquemines Parish encompasses the last {{convert|70|mi|km}} of the Mississippi River before it reaches the Gulf of Mexico, it is the site of several oil refineries, which rely on the shipping lanes for moving their product. The [[Mississippi River Delta]] of Plaquemines is also a base for assistance to offshore oil rigs. Plaquemines Parish was the first place in the United States where shippers used a [[Intermodal container|container]] for cargo in foreign trade. The area is also known for having the southernmost point in Louisiana, at just under 29 degrees north.\n\nThe [[1901 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Four|August 1901 Hurricane]] caused damage, including 4 feet of water in [[Buras, Louisiana|Buras]].<ref>[http://www.thecajuns.com/lahurricanes.htm \"Louisiana Hurricanes\"], The Cajuns</ref>\n\nThe [[1915 New Orleans Hurricane|Great Hurricane of 1915]] devastated much of the parish, with multiple [[levee]] breaches on both sides of the Mississippi, a 12-foot [[storm surge]], and hundreds of deaths. Homelessness was widespread, and many people were reduced to starvation until charitable aid arrived.<ref>[http://files.usgwarchives.net/la/plaquemines/history/hurc1915.txt \"Hurricane of 1915: Plaquemines Parish History\"]</ref> The old Parish Courthouse in Pointe \u00e0 la Hache was among the many buildings destroyed in the storm, but a new one was completed within the year.\n\nIn the early 1900s, Plaquemines was an exporter of citrus. Farmers used the railroads and the Mississippi to ship the large annual harvest to markets.  Commercial fisheries, especially for oysters, have been important in the parish economy.\n\nFrom 1924 to 1969, Plaquemines and [[St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana|St. Bernard]] parishes were effectively the domain of the [[political boss]] [[Leander Perez]], who established a strong hold over the area.<ref name=\"Jeansonne\">Glen Jeansonne, ''Leander Perez: Boss of the Delta'' {{ISBN|1604736372}}</ref> He was notorious for fixing elections and enforcing strict [[racial segregation]]. Upon his death, his sons Leander Perez, Jr., and Chalin O. Perez were elected as the dominant political figures of the parish as district attorney and parish president, respectively.  Interpersonal feuding weakened the family's hold on power. After another decade, by 1980 political opponents had begun to win local elections.<ref name=\"Jeansonne\"/>\n\nIn 1969, [[Hurricane Camille]] devastated portions of Plaquemines Parish. Storm surge over 10 feet, winds over 100 miles per hour, and peak pressure at 941 hPa devastated [[Buras, Louisiana]], [[Venice, Louisiana]], and many more towns and cities.\n\nDuring the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]], city and state leaders used [[dynamite]] to breach a [[levee]] at [[Caernarvon, Louisiana|Caernarvon]], thirteen miles (19&nbsp;km) below Canal Street, in order to save the city of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] from flooding. This action resulted in the flooding of much of the less-populated St. Bernard and Plaquemines parishes, causing widespread destruction to agriculture and housing.\n\nThe Civil Rights struggle for African-Americans to become registered voters in Plaquemines Parish begin in October 1946, under the guidance of Dr. Rev. Percy Murphy Griffin. With the aid of Attorneys Earl Amedee and [[Louis Berry]] from New Orleans, Griffin and twenty-six African-Americans from Plaquemines Parish organized the Plaquemines Parish Civil and Political Organization, Inc., to fight racial barriers established by Perez. In the summer of 1953, the group organized a voter registration drive for African Americans. In 1954, [[Irene Griffin (activist)|Irene Griffin]] became the first black woman to register to vote in the parish.<ref name=\"Irene Griffin Nola\">{{cite news |title=Irene Griffin, first black woman to register to vote in Plaquemines Parish, dies at 84 |url=https://duckduckgo.com/?q=first+black+woman+to+vote&atb=v120-6__&ia=web |accessdate=29 December 2018 |newspaper=New Orleans Times-Picayune |date=29 March 2012 |quote=Mrs. Griffin was an ardent supporter of her husband's efforts to take on segregationist Judge Leander Perez Sr. When the Rev.

In 1966, the organization led the fight to integrate public schools. The movement also worked to get Seymourville and another small community included within the parish boundaries; the city had sought to exclude these majority-black communities to prevent black votes from being counted.<ref>[http://www.thirteen.org/thirteen-fifty-years/videos/louisiana-diary/ ''Louisiana Diary''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803043507/http://www.thirteen.org/thirteen-fifty-years/videos/louisiana-diary/ |date=2014-08-03 }}, 16 March 1964, Written, directed and narrated by Richard O.

After 1965, African Americans in Louisiana began full participation in Louisiana politics.\n\nIn 1965, [[Hurricane Betsy]] flooded many buildings, including the parish courthouse, and caused nine deaths. Leander Perez sealed off the parish to control the distribution of state assistance.<ref>Jeansonne; ''Leander Perez'', p. 354</ref>\n\nIt is estimated that without significant human intervention, Plaquemines Parish will lose 55% of its current land to rising sea levels over the next 50 years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/08/us/fema-disaster-recovery-climate-change.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage|title=As Storms Keep Coming, FEMA Spends Billions in \u2018Cycle\u2019 of Damage and Repair|access-date=2018-10-09|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Historic sites===\n{{Main|National Register of Historic Places listings in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana}}\n\nThe parish includes three United States [[National Historic Landmarks]]:\n*[[Fort De La Boulaye Site]],\n*[[Fort Jackson, Louisiana|Fort Jackson]], and\n*[[Fort St. Philip]].\nThe parish has five other sites listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], including [[Woodland Plantation (West Pointe a la Hache, Louisiana)|Woodland Plantation]], which has been depicted on the label of [[Southern Comfort]] liqueur since the 1930s.

The Parish government is working with public and private partners to invest in renewable energy, including [[hydrokinetic energy]] and [[wind energy]]. Plaquemines has a huge potential for hydrokinetic energy sites along deep bends in the Mississippi River.

Wind Power Densities are divided into seven Wind Power Classes. According to the American Wind Energy Association, Plaquemines has winds in specified areas that fall into a Wind Power Class of seven, which makes the Parish a particularly attractive location for wind turbine investment. Wind turbines would likely be placed at the mouth of the Mississippi, where winds are the strongest.  \nWind Energy Systems Technology has proposed to build a 12.5 MV wind farm in [[Barataria Bay]] off the coast of Plaquemines Parish.
