As an [[expansion team]] in the [[American League]], along with the [[1969 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]], the Pilots were placed in the newly established [[American League West|West]] division.

As an [[expansion team]] in the [[American League]], along with the [[1969 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]], the Pilots were placed in the newly established [[American League West|West]] division. They finished last among the six teams with a record of 64\u201398 ({{winning percentage|64|98}}), 33 games behind the division champion [[1969 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]].\n\nFewer than 678,000 fans came to see the Pilots, which ranked 20th of the 24 major league teams<ref name=brf69at>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/1969-misc.shtml|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|title=1969 Major League Baseball Attendance & Miscellaneous |accessdate=August 9, 2013}}</ref> \u2014 a major reason why the team was forced into bankruptcy after only one season.<ref name=fssoscm>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ru9OAAAAIBAJ&sjid=vgEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7258,1156659 |newspaper=Toledp Blade |agency=Associated Press |title=Financially stricken Seattle owners still courting move|date=March 1970|page=29}}</ref> Despite the poor conditions at aging [[Sick's Stadium]], the ticket prices were among the highest in the major leagues.<ref name=ssdhru>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LVgaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=OCgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2841,222693|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal |title=Seattle Story: Downhill Run |date=April 1, 1970 |page=15}}</ref> The bankruptcy sale of the team was approved by a federal court in Seattle on March 31,<ref name=wblaco>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LVgaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=OCgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6687%2C12506|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal|title=We're Big League Again!

Part of the Pilots' season was also documented in the book ''[[Ball Four]]'' by [[Jim Bouton]]. In 2020, a book specifically about the behind-the-scenes management of the team and its move to Milwaukee titled ''Inside Pitch: Insiders Reveal How the Ill-Fated Seattle Pilots Got Played into Bankruptcy in One Year'' by Rick Allen was released.

Nickerson House''', located at 40 East Erie Street in the [[Near North Side, Chicago|Near North Side neighborhood]] of [[Chicago, Illinois]], is a [[Chicago Landmark]].  It was designed by [[Edward J. Burling]] of the firm of Burling and Whitehouse and built for Samuel and Mathilda Nickerson in 1883. Samuel M. Nickerson was a prominent figure in the rising national banking industry, who was said to have owned at one point more national bank stock than anyone else in the United States.<ref>''Chicago Daily Tribune'', July 21, 1914. \"S. M. Nickerson Expires in East: Pioneer Banker of Chicago Dies in East Brewster, Mass, at Age of 84.\" p. 7</ref>\n\nIn 1916, in an early act of historic-building preservation, a group of wealthy Chicagoans bought the house and donated it to the [[American College of Surgeons]] (ASC).  In addition to using the house as its headquarters, ACS built the adjacent classical Murphy Memorial Auditorium for meetings. When the mansion became too small for the ACS, it began renting it out in 1964. The house is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and was bought in 2003 by philanthropist Richard Driehaus. It is home to the [[Driehaus Museum|Richard H. Driehaus Museum]], which focuses on architecture of the [[Gilded Age]], the [[Art Nouveau]] movement.\n\n==Architecture==\n\nThe Nickerson House was designed by one Chicago's earliest prominent architects, Edward J. Burling (1819\u20131892) of Burling and Whitehouse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webapps.cityofchicago.org/landmarksweb/web/districtdetails.htm?disId=7|title=Chicago Landmarks: Burling Row House District|publisher=City of Chicago Department of Housing and Economic Development, Historic Preservation Division|year=2000|accessdate=2013-04-23}}</ref> In addition, three decorators were contracted for the interiors: William August Fiedler (1843\u20131903) and R. W. Bates & Co. of Chicago, and New York-based [[George A. Schastey]] & Co. The three-story, 24,000 square-foot Nickerson House was reported to be the largest and most extravagant private residence in Chicago at the time of its completion. (This distinction would be transferred to the [[Palmer Mansion]] on the Gold Coast several years later.) Nickerson spared no expense, spending $450,000 on the construction and decoration of his home.<ref name=HABS>{{cite book|last=Historic American Buildings Survey|title=Samuel M.

It was designed by [[Edward J. Burling]] of the firm of Burling and Whitehouse and built for Samuel and Mathilda Nickerson in 1883. Samuel M. Nickerson was a prominent figure in the rising national banking industry, who was said to have owned at one point more national bank stock than anyone else in the United States.<ref>''Chicago Daily Tribune'', July 21, 1914. \"S.

In addition to using the house as its headquarters, ACS built the adjacent classical Murphy Memorial Auditorium for meetings. When the mansion became too small for the ACS, it began renting it out in 1964. The house is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and was bought in 2003 by philanthropist Richard Driehaus. It is home to the [[Driehaus Museum|Richard H.

The three-story, 24,000 square-foot Nickerson House was reported to be the largest and most extravagant private residence in Chicago at the time of its completion.

The plan would have included nearly double the current parking and a replacement theater with a greater capacity. At the time of the announcement, a price tag of $2 billion was announced.\n\nFollowing the reorganization of the agency that runs Navy Pier and McCormick Place, a new study was commissioned to reinvigorate the upgrade process. The new study, by the Urban Land Institute, was released on November 11, 2010 and recommended a more modest set of enhancements aimed at retaining the Pier's role as a public space, rather than turning it into a theme park. Suggested elements include a concert venue, an enlarged [[Chicago Shakespeare Theater]] space, new restaurants, a renovated commercial area around the Pier's entrance and additional park-like features to bring people closer to the lake.

In 1927, the pier was renamed Navy Pier to honor the naval veterans who served in [[World War I]].\n\nIn 1941, during [[World War II]], the pier became a training center for the [[United States Navy]]; about 10,000 people worked, trained and lived there. The pier contained a 2,500-seat theater, gym, 12-chair barber shop, tailor, cobbler shops, soda fountain and a vast kitchen and hospital.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-01-08/site/ct-per-flash-navypier-0108-20120109-24_1_navy-pier-municipal-pier-naval-base|title=Chicago history, Chicago Flashback: Navy Pier|work =Chicago Tribune|date=January 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1946, as the Navy was winding down from its mission, the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] held classes at the pier.

But maintenance was not done and the pier went into decline.\n\nIn 1989, the City of Chicago had the [[Urban Land Institute]] (ULI) reimagine uses for the pier. The [[Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority]] (MPEA) was created; its responsibility was to manage and operate Navy Pier as well as [[McCormick Place]].

The plan would have included nearly double the current parking and a replacement theater with a greater capacity. At the time of the announcement, a price tag of $2 billion was announced.\n\nFollowing the reorganization of the agency that runs Navy Pier and McCormick Place, a new study was commissioned to reinvigorate the upgrade process. The new study, by the Urban Land Institute, was released on November 11, 2010 and recommended a more modest set of enhancements aimed at retaining the Pier's role as a public space, rather than turning it into a theme park. Suggested elements include a concert venue, an enlarged [[Chicago Shakespeare Theater]] space, new restaurants, a renovated commercial area around the Pier's entrance and additional park-like features to bring people closer to the lake.
