Morrison and Henderson remained the only constants, and a less successful version of Them soldiered on after Morrison's departure.<ref>Heylin (2003), page 118</ref>\n\n[[Dick Rowe]] of [[Decca Records]] became aware of the band's performances, and signed Them to a standard two-year contract.

This session was remarkable in its employment of two drums tracks, which can be clearly heard in the stereo mixes of \"Gloria\" and \"One Two Brown Eyes\". Rowe used [[session musician]]s [[Arthur Greenslade]] on [[Organ (music)|organ]] and [[Bobby Graham (musician)|Bobby Graham]] on second drum kit.<ref name=\"Turner pp. 48-51\">Turner, pp. 48\u201351</ref> At this late stage it became clear that the parents of Eric Wrixon, a [[minor (law)|minor in law]], would not sign the contract on his behalf so he was replaced by Pat John McAuley.<ref name=\"HintonPage39-46\"/><ref name=\"Turner pp. 48-51\"/> The single, released in August, did not prove successful.\n\nTheir next single, [[Big Joe Williams]]'s \"[[Baby, Please Don't Go]]\" substituted [[Andy White (drummer)|Andy White]] on drums, [[Phil Coulter]] on second keyboard, and added  [[Jimmy Page]] on [[rhythm guitar]].

In December 1964, Them made their [[television]] debut, joining [[The Rolling Stones]], on ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]''<ref>Turner, p. 51</ref> Their manager, Phil Solomon got the track used as the show's [[signature tune]] and within two weeks it was at No. 19 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], eventually peaking at No. 10.<ref>Heylin, pp. 100\u2013101</ref>\n\nIn January 1965, Them toured [[England]] for a second time, staying at the Royal Hotel, which [[disc jockey]] [[Jimmy Savile]] used as his [[London]] base. Savile helped promote the band in his column for ''[[The People]]'' but Them earned a reputation for bad manners and sarcasm in their interviews. Billy Harrison said the attitude problem may have been caused by [[anti-Irish sentiment]]s on the continent at the time. But, when they were interviewed by a reporter from the [[Irish Independent]], the reporter remarked, \"They were the most boorish bunch of youngsters I'd come across in my short career\".  [[Phil Coulter]] recalled the band's interview with a female reporter: \"They would just sit and mutter [[monosyllabic]] grunts to themselves and give her off-the-wall answers\". (Morrison as a solo artist raised such interviews to a \"negative art form\").<ref>Rogan, pp. 108\u2013111</ref> Their management promoted Them by scheduling appearances on ''Ready Steady Go!'' and on ''[[Top Of The Pops]]'' where, rather than performing live, they were expected to mime and lip sync. Morrison said of this appearance, \"It was ridiculous. We were totally anti that type of thing... and we had to get into suits and have make-up put on and all that...\". He also revealed how the band had, until that time, considered the programme a complete joke.<ref>Rogan, pp. 111\u2013112</ref>\n\nTheir next release was Them's biggest hit in the UK, \"[[Here Comes the Night (Them song)|Here Comes the Night]]\". The producer was also the writer of the song, [[Bert Berns]], an [[United States|American]], who had also co-written \"[[Twist and Shout]]\". Backed with \"All for Myself\" it charted in the UK at No. 2 on 22 April [[1965 in music|1965]], five weeks after entering the charts, and went to No. 24 in the [[United States|U.S.]] in May.<ref>Turner, pp. 51\u201352</ref> Both tracks originate from the same session in October 1964 that yielded \"Baby Please Don't Go\" but were temporarily shelved by Decca in favour of [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]]'s version of \"Here Comes the Night\" which reached only No. 50 on the British charts.<ref>Brown, Tony, Jon Kutner & Neil Warwick, ''The Complete Book of the British Charts: Singles and Albums'', Omnibus Press, London,  2002 p. 608</ref>\n\nOn 11 April 1965, Them made a guest appearance at the ''[[NME]]'' Pollwinners Concert at [[Wembley]] Empire Pool: [[Jimmy Savile]] was [[MC]] for this event, which also included [[The Beatles]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Kinks]], [[The Animals]], [[The Searchers (band)|The Searchers]], [[The Moody Blues]] and [[Dusty Springfield]]. The bands had been expected to keep to their current hits, but Them audaciously segued from \"Here Comes the Night\" into a seven-minute version of \"Turn on Your Lovelight\".<ref>Heylin, p. 104</ref> After the performances, ''[[NME]]''{{'}}s Derek Johnson commented that Morrison had \"more genuine soul than any of his British contemporaries\".<ref name=\"HintonPage53\">Hinton, p. 53</ref>\n\nThe band released their first album, ''[[The Angry Young Them]]'', in June 1965 (UK) and it appeared in the USA on [[Parrot Records]] in July. But Them's next single, \"One More Time\", chosen by Phil Solomon, failed \u2013 according to Billy Harrison because it never constituted single material.<ref>Heylin, p. 105</ref> In July 1965, the band added English drummer Terry Noon and Scottish lead guitarist Joe Baldi (born Joseph Baldi, 10 March 1943, in La Spezia, Italy) but they left in September. Their second album, ''[[Them Again]]'', was released in January 1966 in the UK and in April 1966 in the USA.\n\n===Success in North America and departure of Morrison===\n\nThe group was marketed in the [[United States]] as part of the [[British Invasion]].<ref name=\"Chapter6\"/> After the success of \"Here Comes the Night\", the band scored a chart hit again later in 1965 with \"[[Mystic Eyes]]\", which reached No.33. ''Them Again'', released in April 1966 in the US, also charted and the band began a US tour in May 1966.<ref>Hinton, p. 65</ref> From 30 May to 18 June, Them had a residency at the famous [[Whisky a Go Go]] in [[Los Angeles]]. For the final week [[The Doors]] opened for Them and on the last night the two bands and Morrisons jammed a twenty-minute version of \"Gloria\" and a twenty-five-minute version of \"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chickenonaunicycle.com/Whisky-A-Go-Go%20History.htm|publisher=Chickenonaunicyle.com|title=The History of the Whisky-A-Go-Go|date=23 January 2006|accessdate=7 August 2008}}</ref> Them went on to headline at [[The Fillmore]] in [[San Francisco]], California, and then to [[Hawaii]], where disputes erupted among band members and management over money. The band broke apart, Morrison and Henderson returning to Belfast while Ray Elliott (born Raymond Elliott, 23 January 1939, in Belfast, Co Antrim, Northern Ireland) and David Harvey (born David Tufney, 29 July 1943, in Bude, Cornwall) decided to stay in America.<ref name=\"HintonPage69-74\">Hinton, pp. 69\u201354</ref>\n\nVan Morrison has placed the break-up of Them in context: \"There was no motive behind anything you did [back then]. You just did it because you wanted to do it and you enjoyed doing it. That's the way the thing started, but it got twisted somewhere along the way and everybody involved in it got twisted as well, including me.\"(1967) \"You can't take something like that, put it in a box and place a neat little name on it, then try to sell it. That's what they tried to do. That's what killed Them.\" (1973)<ref>Heylin, p. 112</ref>\n\nVan Morrison went on to great success and fame as a solo artist, but Them's combination of [[garage rock]] and [[blues]] proved a major influence on the next generations of rock musicians, and the group's best-known singles have become staples of [[rock and roll]].<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/>\n\n==Post-Morrison==\n\n=== Belfast Gypsies ===\nIn late August 1965, Billy Harrison and Pat McAuley formed a rival Them, competing with the Morrison/Henderson line-up and leading to legal action.<ref>Rogan, pp. 141\u2013142</ref>  In March 1966, the latter won the rights to the name while the former, now without Harrison but with Pat's brother [[Jackie McAuley (Musician)|Jackie McAuley]] (born John James McAuley, 14 December 1946, in [[Coleraine]], [[County Londonderry]], Northern Ireland; ex-Them, ex-[[Paul Brady|Kult]]), were only allowed to call themselves 'Other Them' in the U.K. The McAuley brothers became, unofficially, [[them Belfast Gypsies]] (or Gipsies), though they were never actually billed as such, and recorded two singles on [[Island Records]] (one released under the name ''Freaks of Nature'') and one Swedish-only album, all produced by [[Kim Fowley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richieunterberger.com/fowley.html|publisher=Richieunterbunter.com|title=Kim Fowley|date=2 March 2004|accessdate=25 October 2008}}</ref> They toured Europe billed as Them and released a French EP under that name but broke up in November 1966.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.break-a-way.de/pages/belfast/story.htm|publisher=Ken McLeod|title=A Brief True History Of Belfast Gypsies|accessdate=25 March 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718103354/http://www.break-a-way.de/pages/belfast/story.htm|archivedate=18 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Not long after that the Morrison line-up also split. In March 1967 Morrison did a short tour of the [[Netherlands]] backed by [[Cuby & the Blizzards]] and then left for New York to start his [[solo (music)|solo]] career. The rest regrouped in Belfast, recruited Kenny McDowell (born Kenneth McDowell, 21 December 1944, in Belfast, County Antrim, Northern Ireland) (ex-''Mad Lads'') as lead singer and continued touring and recording steadily after relocating to the US in early 1967 at the invitation of producer Ray Ruff.\n\n=== 1968 until dissolution ===\nTwo albums, ''[[Now and \"Them\"|Now and Them]]'' and ''Time Out!

Sometimes, depending on his mood, the song could last up to twenty minutes. Morrison has said, \"Them lived and died on the stage at the Maritime Hotel,\" believing the band did not manage to capture the spontaneity and energy of their live performances on their records.<ref>Turner (1993), page 44.</ref> The statement also reflected the instability of the Them line-up, with numerous members passing through the ranks after the definitive Maritime period. Morrison and Henderson remained the only constants, and a less successful version of Them soldiered on after Morrison's departure.<ref>Heylin (2003), page 118</ref>\n\n[[Dick Rowe]] of [[Decca Records]] became aware of the band's performances, and signed Them to a standard two-year contract.

One fan's recording of \"[[Turn On Your Love Light]]\" made its way to Mervyn and [[Phil Solomon (music executive)|Phil Solomon]], who contacted [[Decca Records]]' [[Dick Rowe]], who then travelled to Belfast to hear Them perform. Rowe and Phil Solomon agreed on a two-year contract with the members of the band then signed up to Solomon. Morrison, at eighteen, had to have his father sign for him. Within a few weeks, the group was taken to England and into Decca's [[recording studio]] in [[West Hampstead]] for their first recording session.<ref name=\"TurnerPage46\">Turner, p. 46.</ref><ref name=\"HintonPage39-46\">Hinton, pp. 39\u201346.</ref><ref name=\"electricparrot\">{{cite web|url=http://eclecticparrot.com/reviews/classic/63-story-of-them-van-morrison.html|title=Story of Them featuring Van Morrison|publisher=Eclecticparrot|accessdate=2 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Peak years==\n===With Decca===\n{{listen\n |filename = Gloria - Them.ogg|\n |title=\"Gloria\"|description=Morrison's garage rock classic was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999.

This session was remarkable in its employment of two drums tracks, which can be clearly heard in the stereo mixes of \"Gloria\" and \"One Two Brown Eyes\". Rowe used [[session musician]]s [[Arthur Greenslade]] on [[Organ (music)|organ]] and [[Bobby Graham (musician)|Bobby Graham]] on second drum kit.<ref name=\"Turner pp. 48-51\">Turner, pp. 48\u201351</ref> At this late stage it became clear that the parents of Eric Wrixon, a [[minor (law)|minor in law]], would not sign the contract on his behalf so he was replaced by Pat John McAuley.<ref name=\"HintonPage39-46\"/><ref name=\"Turner pp. 48-51\"/> The single, released in August, did not prove successful.\n\nTheir next single, [[Big Joe Williams]]'s \"[[Baby, Please Don't Go]]\" substituted [[Andy White (drummer)|Andy White]] on drums, [[Phil Coulter]] on second keyboard, and added  [[Jimmy Page]] on [[rhythm guitar]].  [[Lead guitar]] was the work of Billy Harrison.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Please Please Me: Sixties British Pop, Inside Out|last=Thompson|first=Gordon|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-19-533318-3|location=|pages=|ref=harv}}</ref> It was released in November with \"Gloria\" as its [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]. In December 1964, Them made their [[television]] debut, joining [[The Rolling Stones]], on ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]''<ref>Turner, p. 51</ref> Their manager, Phil Solomon got the track used as the show's [[signature tune]] and within two weeks it was at No. 19 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], eventually peaking at No. 10.<ref>Heylin, pp. 100\u2013101</ref>\n\nIn January 1965, Them toured [[England]] for a second time, staying at the Royal Hotel, which [[disc jockey]] [[Jimmy Savile]] used as his [[London]] base. Savile helped promote the band in his column for ''[[The People]]'' but Them earned a reputation for bad manners and sarcasm in their interviews. Billy Harrison said the attitude problem may have been caused by [[anti-Irish sentiment]]s on the continent at the time. But, when they were interviewed by a reporter from the [[Irish Independent]], the reporter remarked, \"They were the most boorish bunch of youngsters I'd come across in my short career\".  [[Phil Coulter]] recalled the band's interview with a female reporter: \"They would just sit and mutter [[monosyllabic]] grunts to themselves and give her off-the-wall answers\". (Morrison as a solo artist raised such interviews to a \"negative art form\").<ref>Rogan, pp. 108\u2013111</ref> Their management promoted Them by scheduling appearances on ''Ready Steady Go!'' and on ''[[Top Of The Pops]]'' where, rather than performing live, they were expected to mime and lip sync. Morrison said of this appearance, \"It was ridiculous. We were totally anti that type of thing... and we had to get into suits and have make-up put on and all that...\". He also revealed how the band had, until that time, considered the programme a complete joke.<ref>Rogan, pp. 111\u2013112</ref>\n\nTheir next release was Them's biggest hit in the UK, \"[[Here Comes the Night (Them song)|Here Comes the Night]]\". The producer was also the writer of the song, [[Bert Berns]], an [[United States|American]], who had also co-written \"[[Twist and Shout]]\". Backed with \"All for Myself\" it charted in the UK at No. 2 on 22 April [[1965 in music|1965]], five weeks after entering the charts, and went to No. 24 in the [[United States|U.S.]] in May.<ref>Turner, pp. 51\u201352</ref> Both tracks originate from the same session in October 1964 that yielded \"Baby Please Don't Go\" but were temporarily shelved by Decca in favour of [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]]'s version of \"Here Comes the Night\" which reached only No. 50 on the British charts.<ref>Brown, Tony, Jon Kutner & Neil Warwick, ''The Complete Book of the British Charts: Singles and Albums'', Omnibus Press, London,  2002 p. 608</ref>\n\nOn 11 April 1965, Them made a guest appearance at the ''[[NME]]'' Pollwinners Concert at [[Wembley]] Empire Pool: [[Jimmy Savile]] was [[MC]] for this event, which also included [[The Beatles]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Kinks]], [[The Animals]], [[The Searchers (band)|The Searchers]], [[The Moody Blues]] and [[Dusty Springfield]]. The bands had been expected to keep to their current hits, but Them audaciously segued from \"Here Comes the Night\" into a seven-minute version of \"Turn on Your Lovelight\".<ref>Heylin, p. 104</ref> After the performances, ''[[NME]]''{{'}}s Derek Johnson commented that Morrison had \"more genuine soul than any of his British contemporaries\".<ref name=\"HintonPage53\">Hinton, p. 53</ref>\n\nThe band released their first album, ''[[The Angry Young Them]]'', in June 1965 (UK) and it appeared in the USA on [[Parrot Records]] in July. But Them's next single, \"One More Time\", chosen by Phil Solomon, failed \u2013 according to Billy Harrison because it never constituted single material.<ref>Heylin, p. 105</ref> In July 1965, the band added English drummer Terry Noon and Scottish lead guitarist Joe Baldi (born Joseph Baldi, 10 March 1943, in La Spezia, Italy) but they left in September. Their second album, ''[[Them Again]]'', was released in January 1966 in the UK and in April 1966 in the USA.\n\n===Success in North America and departure of Morrison===\n\nThe group was marketed in the [[United States]] as part of the [[British Invasion]].<ref name=\"Chapter6\"/> After the success of \"Here Comes the Night\", the band scored a chart hit again later in 1965 with \"[[Mystic Eyes]]\", which reached No.33. ''Them Again'', released in April 1966 in the US, also charted and the band began a US tour in May 1966.<ref>Hinton, p. 65</ref> From 30 May to 18 June, Them had a residency at the famous [[Whisky a Go Go]] in [[Los Angeles]]. For the final week [[The Doors]] opened for Them and on the last night the two bands and Morrisons jammed a twenty-minute version of \"Gloria\" and a twenty-five-minute version of \"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chickenonaunicycle.com/Whisky-A-Go-Go%20History.htm|publisher=Chickenonaunicyle.com|title=The History of the Whisky-A-Go-Go|date=23 January 2006|accessdate=7 August 2008}}</ref> Them went on to headline at [[The Fillmore]] in [[San Francisco]], California, and then to [[Hawaii]], where disputes erupted among band members and management over money. The band broke apart, Morrison and Henderson returning to Belfast while Ray Elliott (born Raymond Elliott, 23 January 1939, in Belfast, Co Antrim, Northern Ireland) and David Harvey (born David Tufney, 29 July 1943, in Bude, Cornwall) decided to stay in America.<ref name=\"HintonPage69-74\">Hinton, pp. 69\u201354</ref>\n\nVan Morrison has placed the break-up of Them in context: \"There was no motive behind anything you did [back then]. You just did it because you wanted to do it and you enjoyed doing it. That's the way the thing started, but it got twisted somewhere along the way and everybody involved in it got twisted as well, including me.\"(1967) \"You can't take something like that, put it in a box and place a neat little name on it, then try to sell it. That's what they tried to do. That's what killed Them.\" (1973)<ref>Heylin, p. 112</ref>\n\nVan Morrison went on to great success and fame as a solo artist, but Them's combination of [[garage rock]] and [[blues]] proved a major influence on the next generations of rock musicians, and the group's best-known singles have become staples of [[rock and roll]].<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/>\n\n==Post-Morrison==\n\n=== Belfast Gypsies ===\nIn late August 1965, Billy Harrison and Pat McAuley formed a rival Them, competing with the Morrison/Henderson line-up and leading to legal action.<ref>Rogan, pp. 141\u2013142</ref>  In March 1966, the latter won the rights to the name while the former, now without Harrison but with Pat's brother [[Jackie McAuley (Musician)|Jackie McAuley]] (born John James McAuley, 14 December 1946, in [[Coleraine]], [[County Londonderry]], Northern Ireland; ex-Them, ex-[[Paul Brady|Kult]]), were only allowed to call themselves 'Other Them' in the U.K. The McAuley brothers became, unofficially, [[them Belfast Gypsies]] (or Gipsies), though they were never actually billed as such, and recorded two singles on [[Island Records]] (one released under the name ''Freaks of Nature'') and one Swedish-only album, all produced by [[Kim Fowley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richieunterberger.com/fowley.html|publisher=Richieunterbunter.com|title=Kim Fowley|date=2 March 2004|accessdate=25 October 2008}}</ref> They toured Europe billed as Them and released a French EP under that name but broke up in November 1966.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.break-a-way.de/pages/belfast/story.htm|publisher=Ken McLeod|title=A Brief True History Of Belfast Gypsies|accessdate=25 March 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718103354/http://www.break-a-way.de/pages/belfast/story.htm|archivedate=18 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Not long after that the Morrison line-up also split. In March 1967 Morrison did a short tour of the [[Netherlands]] backed by [[Cuby & the Blizzards]] and then left for New York to start his [[solo (music)|solo]] career. The rest regrouped in Belfast, recruited Kenny McDowell (born Kenneth McDowell, 21 December 1944, in Belfast, County Antrim, Northern Ireland) (ex-''Mad Lads'') as lead singer and continued touring and recording steadily after relocating to the US in early 1967 at the invitation of producer Ray Ruff.\n\n=== 1968 until dissolution ===\nTwo albums, ''[[Now and \"Them\"|Now and Them]]'' and ''Time Out!

On the \u20ac1 and \u20ac2 coins, the island is shown to be directly east of mainland [[Greece]]; on the 10c, 20c and 50c coins, it appears directly below [[Crete]]. The original proposal from the [[European Commission]] was to include [[Turkey]] on the map, but this design was rejected by the [[Council of the European Union|Council]].\n\n==== Initial design ====\nThe original designs of the 10c, 20c and 50c coins showed the outline of each of the 15 EU member states. Each state was shown as separate from the others, thus giving Europe the appearance of an [[archipelago]]. EU member states outside the [[eurozone]] (the [[United Kingdom]], [[Sweden]], and [[Denmark]]) were also depicted. Non-EU states were not depicted.\n\nOn the \u20ac1 and \u20ac2 coins, the landmass appeared more cohesive although borders were indicated. As in current issues, all coins featured 12 stars in their design.\n\nThe year featured on the coins can date back to 1999, when the currency was formally established (only [[Belgian euro coins|Belgian]], [[Finnish euro coins|Finnish]], [[French euro coins|French]], [[Dutch euro coins|Dutch]], and [[Spanish euro coins|Spanish]] coins were struck with the 1999 date). These countries traditionally strike coins with the year of minting rather than the year it was put into circulation.\n\nResearchers from the [[University of Z\u00fcrich]] warned that an external ring of metal surrounding an inner pill of a different colour, as in the euro coins, can lead to the release of high levels of nickel, causing allergic reactions with people sensitive to the metal. The researchers also warned that the coins could contain between 240 and 320 times the amount of nickel allowed under the EU nickel directive.<ref name=\"Euro allergic reaction\">{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2251152.stm | title=BBC NEWS Health Euro coins 'trigger allergy' | publisher=bbc.co.uk | work=BBC News | date=12 September 2002 | accessdate=1 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== National sides ===\n{{See also|Identifying marks on euro coins}}\nThe [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] side varies from state to state, with each member allowed to choose its own design. Each of the eight coins can have the same design (such as [[Irish euro coins|Irish coins]]), or can vary from coin to coin (such as [[Italian euro coins|Italian coins]]). In monarchies, the national side usually features a portrait of the country's monarch, often in a design carried over from the former currency (e.g. [[Belgian euro coins|Belgian coins]]). Republics tend to feature national monuments, symbols, or stylised designs (such as [[French euro coins|French coins]]). Engravings on the edge of the \u20ac2 coin are also subject to national choice.\n\n[[File:Eurocoin.ie.100.gif|thumb|right|125px|Irish [[1 euro coin]] national side]]\n\nThere are, however, some restrictions on the design: it must include [[Flag of Europe|twelve stars]], [[Identifying marks on euro coins#Designer, sculptor and engraver initials on euro coins|the engraver's initials]], and the year of issue. New issues must also include the name of the issuing country or an abbreviation of it. It may not repeat the denomination of the coin or the word ''euro'' unless it is in a different alphabet (such as on [[Greek euro coins|Greek coins]]).<ref name=\"Common guidelines on national sides - EC\"/> This rule is flouted by [[Austrian euro coins|Austria]]. The national side was also to remain unchanged until the end of 2008, unless a monarch depicted on a coin died or abdicated (such as in the case of the [[Vatican euro coins|Vatican's coins]] or [[Monegasque euro coins|Monegasque coins]]).\n\n[[File:Eur.de.100.gif|thumb|right|125px|German [[1 euro coin]] national side]]\n\nThere are at present no plans to abolish the national designs in favour of a common European one. However, the [[European Commission|Commission]] has proposed that the 1c, 2c and 5c coins have a common design to keep costs down.<ref name=\"5yrs. Euro coins & notes\"/>\n\n[[File:Moneda de 2 Euros de Finl\u00e0ndia.JPG|thumb|right|125px|Finnish [[2 euro coin]] national side]]\n\nThough they are not members of the EU, [[Andorra]], [[Monaco]], [[San Marino]], and the [[Vatican City]] also have euro coins featuring a national side, but a considerable number of these coins are not put into general circulation by the authorities who instead sell them to collectors for prices higher than their face value.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/world/outside_euro_area/index_en.htm |title=The euro outside the euro area |work=ec.europa.eu |date=5 July 2011|accessdate=10 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Eurocoin.cy.200.gif|thumb|right|125px|Cypriot [[2 euro coin]] national side]]\n\nNo [[Special member state territories and the European Union|territories associated with Eurozone countries]] are issuing their own euro coins. France and Netherlands have areas which have their own currencies. \n\nAs of 2015 there are 23 countries issuing coins with their own national sides, making it 184 different euro coins, not counting annual differences or commemorative coins.\n\n==== Subsequent changes ====\n{{quote|The national sides of all denominations of the euro circulation coins should bear an indication of the issuing Member State by means of the Member State\u2019s name or an abbreviation of it.\n\nThe national side should not repeat any indication on the denomination, or any parts thereof, of the coin neither should it repeat the name of the single currency or of its subdivision, unless such indication stems from the use of a different alphabet.\n\nThis Recommendation should apply to national sides and edge letterings of both normal and commemorative euro circulation coins. It should not apply to the national sides and edge letterings of both normal and commemorative euro circulation coins which have been first issued prior to the adoption of this Recommendation.}}\n\nThe above paragraphs, from a European Commission [[Recommendation (European Union)|Recommendation]] of 19 December 2008, in essence, exhorted five eurozone members to change their national designs. Finland and Belgium did so in 2007 and 2008 respectively while Austria, Germany<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://www.zwei-euro.com/2-euro/ | title=No design change for Austrian and German euro coins (in German) | publisher=www.zwei-euro.com | date=2008-02-01 | accessdate=2008-02-01}}</ref> and Greece have not announced any design changes as of February 2018. However, the regulation only stipulates 20 June 2062 (''[[sic]]'') as a deadline for revising designs.<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:169:0008:0010:EN:PDF | title=COUNCIL REGULATION (EU) No 566/2012 | publisher=Council of Ministers of the European Union | date=2007-06-20 | accessdate=2016-04-30}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2016}}, Belgium, Monaco, the Netherlands, Spain and the Vatican have all experienced a change in head of state and have revised their designs to reflect this and the new regulation where applicable.\n\n=== Security features ===\nEuro coins have high-security machine-readable features.<ref name=\"ECB Coin security features\">{{cite web | url=http://www.ecb.int/euro/coins/security/html/index.en.html | title=ECB: Security features | publisher=ECB | work=ECB | accessdate=2 July 2013}}</ref> Sophisticated bi-metal and sandwich technologies have been put into the \u20ac1 and \u20ac2 coins.<ref name=\"ECB Coin security features\"/> The 10c, 20c and 50c coins are made of [[Nordic gold]], which is a unique alloy, difficult to melt and used exclusively for coins.<ref name=\"ECB Coin security features\"/> The lettering on the edge of the \u20ac2 coin also protects it from counterfeiting.<ref name=\"ECB Coin security features\"/>\n\n=== Features for persons with impaired sight ===\nEuro coins were designed in cooperation with organisations representing [[blindness|blind]] persons, and as a result they incorporate many features allowing them to be distinguished by touch alone. In addition, their visual appearance is designed to make them easy to tell apart for persons who cannot read the inscriptions on the coins.\n\nThe coins increase in size and weight with value. Of the eight denominations of euro coins, the three lowest denominations are small, resemble copper in colour and are quite thin and light. The next three denominations resemble gold in colour and are thicker as well as heavier.  The highest two denominations are bimetallic, being generally larger and thicker than the lower denominations.\n\nIn general, the greater the value, the heavier and larger the coin. Copper colour identifies low value; gold colour identifies medium value; two different metals identify high value.\n\nThere are also differences within each group. The 2 cent coin has a grooved edge to distinguish it from the 1 and 5 cent coins and also from the [[US penny]], which has the same colour and diameter. Similarly, the 20 cent coin is smooth with seven indents to distinguish it from the 10 and 50 cent coins.\n\nAlthough there have been other currencies predating the euro that were specifically designed in similar ways (different sizes, colours, and ridges) to aid the visually impaired, the introduction of the euro constitutes the first time that authorities have consulted associations representing the blind and visually impaired before the release of a currency.\n\n==Commemorative issues==\n{{main|\u20ac2 commemorative coins}}\n\nEach state allowed to issue coins may also mint two [[\u20ac2 commemorative coins|commemorative coins]] each year from June 2012. From 2004 to May 2012, countries were only allowed to mint one coin per year. Only \u20ac2 coins may be used in this way (for them to be legal tender) and there is a limit on the number that can be issued. The coin must show the normal design criteria, such as the [[Flag of Europe|twelve stars]], the year and the issuing country.\n\n[[Greece]] was the first country to issue a commemorative coin, and was followed by all but [[Cyprus]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. However, in 2007 every [[eurozone]] state participated in the [[Treaty of Rome]] programme, where all member states issued a coin of similar design to commemorate the signing of the Treaty of Rome, the only difference being the name of the issuing country and the language of the text. This was repeated in 2009 in commemoration of the 10th anniversary of the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|Economic and Monetary Union]]. The design was selected by electronic voting by EU citizens.{{dead link|url=http://www.eurodesigncontest.eu/index.cfm|date=August 2009}} The most recent common commemorative coin was issued in 2015 to commemorate 30 years of the European Union flag.\n\nIn 2006, [[Germany]] began issuing a series of coins, the [[German Bundesl\u00e4nder commemorative coin|German Bundesl\u00e4nder series]], showing each of the [[states of Germany]] on its coins; this will last until 2021.\n\n[[Spain]] started a commemorative coin series ''{{lang|es|Patrimonio de la Humanidad de la UNESCO}}'' (UNESCO World Heritage) in 2010, commemorating [[UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Spain|all of Spain's UNESCO World Heritage Sites]], which could continue until 2050. The order in which the coin for a specific site is issued coincides with the order in which they were declared a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage site]].<ref>{{cite web | date=2010-01-19 | url=http://www.zwei-euro.com/news/artikel/a/2010/01/19/article/weitere-ausgaben-der-2-euro-gedenkmuenzenserie-unesco-weltkulturerbestaetten.html | title=''Spanien: Weitere Ausgaben der 2-Euro-Gedenkm\u00fcnzenserie \"UNESCO-Weltkulturerbest\u00e4tten\"'' | accessdate=2010-01-20 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718161301/http://www.zwei-euro.com/news/artikel/a/2010/01/19/article/weitere-ausgaben-der-2-euro-gedenkmuenzenserie-unesco-weltkulturerbestaetten.html | archive-date=2011-07-18 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[Malta]] issued a series of [[\u20ac2 commemorative coins#Maltese constitutional history series|five \u20ac2 commemorative coins]], all related to the [[Malta#Independence and Republic|Maltese constitutional history]].

Unlike normal issues, these coins ''are not [[legal tender]] throughout the [[eurozone]]'', but '''only''' in the country where they are issued (e.g. a \u20ac10 [[Finland|Finnish]] commemorative coin cannot be used in [[Portugal]]).\n\nHowever, these gold coins are intended for collectors as their bullion value vastly exceeds their [[face value]]. Some silver coins, such as the [[Germany|German]] \u20ac10 commemoratives, are often available at banks and some retailers at face value. These coins, however, generally do not circulate but are kept by collectors.\n\nIt is uncertain whether the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]] will grant them legal tender status elsewhere outside national boundaries, as [[San Marino]], [[Monaco]], and the [[Vatican City]] also issue this kind of coins.\n\n===Belgian 2.50 euro coin===\nThe '''Belgian 2.50 euro coin''' is a [[commemorative coin|commemorative]] [[euro coin]] valid in [[Belgium]] first issued in 2015 with 70,000 coins minted. The coin commemorates the 200th anniversary of [[Napoleon]]'s defeat in the [[Battle of Waterloo]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Dan|last=Bilefsky|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/10/world/europe/belgium-commemorates-waterloo-with-euro-and-france-is-not-pleased.html|title=Belgium Commemorates Waterloo With a Coin, and France Is Not Pleased|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=9 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nBelgium originally planned to mint [[\u20ac2 commemorative coins]] for the occasion. This plan was blocked by [[France]], however (after 180,000 of the coins had already been minted, they had to be discarded). Minting in the 2.5 euro denomination obviates France's complaints as the coins will not be legal tender in the [[European Union]], they are only legal for currency in Belgium.<ref>Jason Karaian.

Given a total circulation of 56 billion coins, counterfeit coins are relatively rare. About half the counterfeits feature the [[German euro coins|German national design]], but counterfeits have been detected for every issuing country. The majority of counterfeit coins are \u20ac2 (60% in 2011), with most of the rest being \u20ac1, and a few 50c coins. The number of counterfeit \u20ac2 coins being found annually is decreasing, while numbers of counterfeit \u20ac1 and 50-cent coins are increasing.\n\nTotal amount of counterfeit coins seized from circulation in:\n* 2017: Pre-circulation: 31,059, circulation: 160,914<ref name=AntiFraud2017>{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/news/economy-finance/eu-wide-progress-tackling-euro-coin-counterfeiting_en|title=EU-wide progress on tackling euro coin counterfeiting in 2017|publisher=Europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2019-02-17}}</ref>\n* 2016: Pre-circulation: 77,084, circulation: 150,258<ref name=AntiFraud2017/>\n* 2015: Pre-circulation: 20, circulation: 146,889<ref name=AntiFraud2017/>\n* 2014: Pre-circulation: 301,970 circulation: 192,195<ref name=AntiFraud2017/>\n* 2013: Pre-circulation: 31,051, circulation: 177,600<ref name=AntiFraud2017/>\n* 2012: 184,000<ref name=EuroCounterfeiting2012>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-105_en.htm |title=EUROPA - Press Releases - Euro coin counterfeiting in 2012 |publisher=Europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2019-02-17}}</ref>\n* 2011: 157,000<ref name=EuroCounterfeiting2011>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/12/81 |title=EUROPA - Press Releases - Euro coin counterfeiting in 2011 |publisher=Europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-24}}</ref>\n* 2010: 186,000<ref name=EuroCounterfeiting2010>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/11/47 |title=EUROPA - Press Releases - Euro coin counterfeiting in 2010 |publisher=Europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-08}}</ref>\n* 2009: 172,100<ref name=EuroCounterfeiting2009>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/10/2 |title=EUROPA - Press Releases - Euro coin counterfeiting in 2009 |publisher=Europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2011-04-10}}</ref>\n* 2008: 195,900<ref name=EuroCounterfeiting2009/>\n* 2007: 211,100<ref name=AntiFraud2007>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/08/10 |title=EUROPA - Press Releases - Euro coin counterfeiting in 2007 |publisher=Europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2011-04-10}}</ref>\n* 2006: 163,800<ref name=AntiFraud2007/>\n* 2005: 100,500<ref name=AntiFraud2007/>\n* 2004: 74,564<ref name=\"AntiFraud2002-2004\">{{cite web | url=http://ec.europa.eu/anti_fraud/media-corner/press-releases/press-releases/2005/20050118_01_en.htm | title=European Commission - OLAF - EURO COIN COUNTERFEITING IN 2004 | publisher=ec.europa.eu | work=European Commission | date=18 January 2005 | accessdate=22 July 2013}}</ref>\n* 2003: 26,191<ref name=\"AntiFraud2002-2004\"/>\n* 2002: 2,336<ref name=\"AntiFraud2002-2004\"/>\n\nThe [[European Technical and Scientific Centre]] estimates that up to 2 million counterfeit coins were put into circulation in 2002.\n\nRecent investigations by the [[European Commission]] have shown that counterfeit sophistication is increasing, making prompt detection more difficult.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.eux.tv/article.aspx?articleId=20053 | title='Most sophisticated' fake euro coin network uncovered in Italy | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405181339/http://www.eux.tv/article.aspx?articleId=20053 | archivedate=2008-04-05 }}</ref> In 2008, Irish [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] [[Eoin Ryan Jnr|Eoin Ryan]] called for tighter regulation over tokens and medals that are being increasingly used for small purchases mainly in vending machines across Europe.<ref name=\"Euro coins protection\">{{cite web | url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?language=en&type=IM-PRESS&reference=20081201STO43283 | title=\"Euro coins need protection,\" says Irish MEP Eoin Ryan | publisher=europarl.europa.eu | work=European Parliament | date=1 December 2013 | accessdate=1 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Small-denomination coins==\nThe 1c, 2c, and 5c coins account for approximately 80% of all new coins minted in the [[eurozone]].

The original proposal from the [[European Commission]] was to include [[Turkey]] on the map, but this design was rejected by the [[Council of the European Union|Council]].\n\n==== Initial design ====\nThe original designs of the 10c, 20c and 50c coins showed the outline of each of the 15 EU member states. Each state was shown as separate from the others, thus giving Europe the appearance of an [[archipelago]]. EU member states outside the [[eurozone]] (the [[United Kingdom]], [[Sweden]], and [[Denmark]]) were also depicted. Non-EU states were not depicted.\n\nOn the \u20ac1 and \u20ac2 coins, the landmass appeared more cohesive although borders were indicated. As in current issues, all coins featured 12 stars in their design.\n\nThe year featured on the coins can date back to 1999, when the currency was formally established (only [[Belgian euro coins|Belgian]], [[Finnish euro coins|Finnish]], [[French euro coins|French]], [[Dutch euro coins|Dutch]], and [[Spanish euro coins|Spanish]] coins were struck with the 1999 date). These countries traditionally strike coins with the year of minting rather than the year it was put into circulation.\n\nResearchers from the [[University of Z\u00fcrich]] warned that an external ring of metal surrounding an inner pill of a different colour, as in the euro coins, can lead to the release of high levels of nickel, causing allergic reactions with people sensitive to the metal. The researchers also warned that the coins could contain between 240 and 320 times the amount of nickel allowed under the EU nickel directive.<ref name=\"Euro allergic reaction\">{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2251152.stm | title=BBC NEWS Health Euro coins 'trigger allergy' | publisher=bbc.co.uk | work=BBC News | date=12 September 2002 | accessdate=1 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== National sides ===\n{{See also|Identifying marks on euro coins}}\nThe [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] side varies from state to state, with each member allowed to choose its own design. Each of the eight coins can have the same design (such as [[Irish euro coins|Irish coins]]), or can vary from coin to coin (such as [[Italian euro coins|Italian coins]]). In monarchies, the national side usually features a portrait of the country's monarch, often in a design carried over from the former currency (e.g. [[Belgian euro coins|Belgian coins]]). Republics tend to feature national monuments, symbols, or stylised designs (such as [[French euro coins|French coins]]). Engravings on the edge of the \u20ac2 coin are also subject to national choice.\n\n[[File:Eurocoin.ie.100.gif|thumb|right|125px|Irish [[1 euro coin]] national side]]\n\nThere are, however, some restrictions on the design: it must include [[Flag of Europe|twelve stars]], [[Identifying marks on euro coins#Designer, sculptor and engraver initials on euro coins|the engraver's initials]], and the year of issue. New issues must also include the name of the issuing country or an abbreviation of it. It may not repeat the denomination of the coin or the word ''euro'' unless it is in a different alphabet (such as on [[Greek euro coins|Greek coins]]).<ref name=\"Common guidelines on national sides - EC\"/> This rule is flouted by [[Austrian euro coins|Austria]]. The national side was also to remain unchanged until the end of 2008, unless a monarch depicted on a coin died or abdicated (such as in the case of the [[Vatican euro coins|Vatican's coins]] or [[Monegasque euro coins|Monegasque coins]]).\n\n[[File:Eur.de.100.gif|thumb|right|125px|German [[1 euro coin]] national side]]\n\nThere are at present no plans to abolish the national designs in favour of a common European one. However, the [[European Commission|Commission]] has proposed that the 1c, 2c and 5c coins have a common design to keep costs down.<ref name=\"5yrs.

France and Netherlands have areas which have their own currencies. \n\nAs of 2015 there are 23 countries issuing coins with their own national sides, making it 184 different euro coins, not counting annual differences or commemorative coins.\n\n==== Subsequent changes ====\n{{quote|The national sides of all denominations of the euro circulation coins should bear an indication of the issuing Member State by means of the Member State\u2019s name or an abbreviation of it.\n\nThe national side should not repeat any indication on the denomination, or any parts thereof, of the coin neither should it repeat the name of the single currency or of its subdivision, unless such indication stems from the use of a different alphabet.\n\nThis Recommendation should apply to national sides and edge letterings of both normal and commemorative euro circulation coins. It should not apply to the national sides and edge letterings of both normal and commemorative euro circulation coins which have been first issued prior to the adoption of this Recommendation.}}\n\nThe above paragraphs, from a European Commission [[Recommendation (European Union)|Recommendation]] of 19 December 2008, in essence, exhorted five eurozone members to change their national designs. Finland and Belgium did so in 2007 and 2008 respectively while Austria, Germany<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://www.zwei-euro.com/2-euro/ | title=No design change for Austrian and German euro coins (in German) | publisher=www.zwei-euro.com | date=2008-02-01 | accessdate=2008-02-01}}</ref> and Greece have not announced any design changes as of February 2018. However, the regulation only stipulates 20 June 2062 (''[[sic]]'') as a deadline for revising designs.<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:169:0008:0010:EN:PDF | title=COUNCIL REGULATION (EU) No 566/2012 | publisher=Council of Ministers of the European Union | date=2007-06-20 | accessdate=2016-04-30}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2016}}, Belgium, Monaco, the Netherlands, Spain and the Vatican have all experienced a change in head of state and have revised their designs to reflect this and the new regulation where applicable.\n\n=== Security features ===\nEuro coins have high-security machine-readable features.<ref name=\"ECB Coin security features\">{{cite web | url=http://www.ecb.int/euro/coins/security/html/index.en.html | title=ECB: Security features | publisher=ECB | work=ECB | accessdate=2 July 2013}}</ref> Sophisticated bi-metal and sandwich technologies have been put into the \u20ac1 and \u20ac2 coins.<ref name=\"ECB Coin security features\"/> The 10c, 20c and 50c coins are made of [[Nordic gold]], which is a unique alloy, difficult to melt and used exclusively for coins.<ref name=\"ECB Coin security features\"/> The lettering on the edge of the \u20ac2 coin also protects it from counterfeiting.<ref name=\"ECB Coin security features\"/>\n\n=== Features for persons with impaired sight ===\nEuro coins were designed in cooperation with organisations representing [[blindness|blind]] persons, and as a result they incorporate many features allowing them to be distinguished by touch alone. In addition, their visual appearance is designed to make them easy to tell apart for persons who cannot read the inscriptions on the coins.\n\nThe coins increase in size and weight with value. Of the eight denominations of euro coins, the three lowest denominations are small, resemble copper in colour and are quite thin and light. The next three denominations resemble gold in colour and are thicker as well as heavier.  The highest two denominations are bimetallic, being generally larger and thicker than the lower denominations.\n\nIn general, the greater the value, the heavier and larger the coin. Copper colour identifies low value; gold colour identifies medium value; two different metals identify high value.\n\nThere are also differences within each group. The 2 cent coin has a grooved edge to distinguish it from the 1 and 5 cent coins and also from the [[US penny]], which has the same colour and diameter. Similarly, the 20 cent coin is smooth with seven indents to distinguish it from the 10 and 50 cent coins.\n\nAlthough there have been other currencies predating the euro that were specifically designed in similar ways (different sizes, colours, and ridges) to aid the visually impaired, the introduction of the euro constitutes the first time that authorities have consulted associations representing the blind and visually impaired before the release of a currency.\n\n==Commemorative issues==\n{{main|\u20ac2 commemorative coins}}\n\nEach state allowed to issue coins may also mint two [[\u20ac2 commemorative coins|commemorative coins]] each year from June 2012. From 2004 to May 2012, countries were only allowed to mint one coin per year. Only \u20ac2 coins may be used in this way (for them to be legal tender) and there is a limit on the number that can be issued. The coin must show the normal design criteria, such as the [[Flag of Europe|twelve stars]], the year and the issuing country.\n\n[[Greece]] was the first country to issue a commemorative coin, and was followed by all but [[Cyprus]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. However, in 2007 every [[eurozone]] state participated in the [[Treaty of Rome]] programme, where all member states issued a coin of similar design to commemorate the signing of the Treaty of Rome, the only difference being the name of the issuing country and the language of the text. This was repeated in 2009 in commemoration of the 10th anniversary of the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|Economic and Monetary Union]]. The design was selected by electronic voting by EU citizens.{{dead link|url=http://www.eurodesigncontest.eu/index.cfm|date=August 2009}} The most recent common commemorative coin was issued in 2015 to commemorate 30 years of the European Union flag.\n\nIn 2006, [[Germany]] began issuing a series of coins, the [[German Bundesl\u00e4nder commemorative coin|German Bundesl\u00e4nder series]], showing each of the [[states of Germany]] on its coins; this will last until 2021.\n\n[[Spain]] started a commemorative coin series ''{{lang|es|Patrimonio de la Humanidad de la UNESCO}}'' (UNESCO World Heritage) in 2010, commemorating [[UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Spain|all of Spain's UNESCO World Heritage Sites]], which could continue until 2050. The order in which the coin for a specific site is issued coincides with the order in which they were declared a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage site]].<ref>{{cite web | date=2010-01-19 | url=http://www.zwei-euro.com/news/artikel/a/2010/01/19/article/weitere-ausgaben-der-2-euro-gedenkmuenzenserie-unesco-weltkulturerbestaetten.html | title=''Spanien: Weitere Ausgaben der 2-Euro-Gedenkm\u00fcnzenserie \"UNESCO-Weltkulturerbest\u00e4tten\"'' | accessdate=2010-01-20 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718161301/http://www.zwei-euro.com/news/artikel/a/2010/01/19/article/weitere-ausgaben-der-2-euro-gedenkmuenzenserie-unesco-weltkulturerbestaetten.html | archive-date=2011-07-18 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[Malta]] issued a series of [[\u20ac2 commemorative coins#Maltese constitutional history series|five \u20ac2 commemorative coins]], all related to the [[Malta#Independence and Republic|Maltese constitutional history]].

Unlike normal issues, these coins ''are not [[legal tender]] throughout the [[eurozone]]'', but '''only''' in the country where they are issued (e.g. a \u20ac10 [[Finland|Finnish]] commemorative coin cannot be used in [[Portugal]]).\n\nHowever, these gold coins are intended for collectors as their bullion value vastly exceeds their [[face value]]. Some silver coins, such as the [[Germany|German]] \u20ac10 commemoratives, are often available at banks and some retailers at face value. These coins, however, generally do not circulate but are kept by collectors.\n\nIt is uncertain whether the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]] will grant them legal tender status elsewhere outside national boundaries, as [[San Marino]], [[Monaco]], and the [[Vatican City]] also issue this kind of coins.\n\n===Belgian 2.50 euro coin===\nThe '''Belgian 2.50 euro coin''' is a [[commemorative coin|commemorative]] [[euro coin]] valid in [[Belgium]] first issued in 2015 with 70,000 coins minted.

This plan was blocked by [[France]], however (after 180,000 of the coins had already been minted, they had to be discarded).

Given a total circulation of 56 billion coins, counterfeit coins are relatively rare. About half the counterfeits feature the [[German euro coins|German national design]], but counterfeits have been detected for every issuing country. The majority of counterfeit coins are \u20ac2 (60% in 2011), with most of the rest being \u20ac1, and a few 50c coins.

Scientists desire a sample of the Sun because evidence suggests that the outer layer of the Sun preserves the composition of the early solar nebula. Therefore, knowing the elemental and isotopic composition of the outer layer of the Sun is effectively the same as knowing the elemental and isotopic composition of the solar nebula. The data can be used to model how planets and other Solar System objects formed, and then extend those results to understanding [[stellar evolution]] and the formation of [[planetary system]]s elsewhere in the universe.\n\nClearly, the ideal sample collection option would be to send a spacecraft to the [[Sun]] itself and collect some solar plasma; however, that is difficult because of the intense heat of the Sun's superheated gases, as well as the dynamic electromagnetic environment of the [[solar corona]], whose flares regularly interfere with the electronics of distant spacecraft. Fortunately, the Sun continuously sheds some of its outer layer in the form of [[solar wind]].\n\nAccordingly, in order to meet the mission science objectives, the ''Genesis'' spacecraft was designed to collect solar wind [[ion]]s and return them to Earth for analysis.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Genesis Discovery Mission: Return of Solar Matter to Earth |journal=Space Science Reviews |first1=D.

The [[spacecraft]] was designed and built by [[Lockheed Martin]] Space Systems at a total mission cost of {{US$|264 million}}.\n\nNASA launched the craft on a [[Delta II|Delta II 7326]] rocket on August 8, 2001, at 16:13:40&nbsp;UTC from [[Cape Canaveral]]. The development of the trajectory for the mission was led by [[Martin Lo]]. Following launch, ''Genesis'' cruised to the Earth-Sun {{L1}} then performed a [[Lissajous orbit]] insertion maneuver, entering an elliptical orbit about {{L1|nolink=yes}} on November 16, 2001. ''Genesis'' exposed its collector arrays on December 3, and began collecting [[solar wind]] particles.

As the capsule was approaching Earth and at the first stages of re-entry, all appeared well.\n\nExtensive planning had been conducted for the capsule's retrieval. A normal [[parachute]] landing might have damaged the delicate samples, so the mission design called for a [[mid-air retrieval]] of the sample return capsule. About {{convert|33|km|mi|abbr=on}} above the ground, a [[drogue parachute]] was to be deployed to slow descent. Then, at a height of {{convert|6.7|km|mi|abbr=on}}, a large [[parafoil]] was to be deployed to slow descent further and leave the capsule in stable flight. A [[helicopter]], with a second helicopter as a backup, was then to attempt to catch the capsule by its parachute on the end of a five-meter hook. Once retrieved, the capsule would have been soft-landed.\n\nThe sample return capsule entered Earth's atmosphere over northern [[Oregon]] at 16:55&nbsp;UTC on September 8, 2004, with a velocity of approximately {{convert|24706|mph|km/s|2|order=flip|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"jpl_hist\"/> Due to a design flaw in a deceleration sensor, parachute deployment was never triggered, and the spacecraft's descent was slowed only by its own [[air resistance]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/149414main_Genesis_MIB.pdf |title=Genesis Mishap Investigation Board Report: Volume 1 |publisher=NASA |first=Michael |last=Ryschkewitsch |display-authors=etal |format=PDF |date=June 13, 2006 |accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> The planned mid-air retrieval could not be carried out, and the capsule crashed into the desert floor of the [[Dugway Proving Ground]] in [[Tooele County, Utah]], at about {{convert|86|m/s|km/h mph|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe capsule broke open on impact, and part of the inner sample capsule was also breached. The damage was less severe than might have been expected given its velocity; it was to some extent cushioned by falling into fairly soft ground.\n\nUnfired pyrotechnic devices in the parachute deployment system and toxic gases from the batteries delayed the recovery team's approach to the crash site. After all was made safe, the damaged sample-return capsule was secured and moved to a clean room for inspection; simultaneously a crew of trained personnel scoured the site for collector fragments and sampled the local desert soil to archive as a reference by which to identify possible contaminants in the future. Recovery efforts by ''Genesis'' team members at the [[Utah Test and Training Range]] \u2013 which included inspecting, cataloging and packaging various collectors \u2013 took four weeks.<ref>{{cite paper |url=http://research.jsc.nasa.gov/PDF/Ares-5.pdf |title=Genesis Recovery Processing |publisher=NASA/JSC |first=E.

Desert dirt entered the capsule, but not liquid water. Because the solar wind particles were expected to be embedded in the wafers, whereas the contaminating dirt was thought likely just to lie on the surface, it was possible to separate the dirt from the samples. Unexpectedly, it was not terrestrial desert soil introduced in the crash that proved most difficult to deal with during the sample analysis process, but the craft's own compounds such as lubricants and craft-building materials.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.nature.com/news/2007/071018/full/news.2007.175.html |title=Crashed spacecraft yields data |journal=Nature |first=Nicola |last=Jones |date=October 18, 2007 |accessdate=October 20, 2007 |doi=10.1038/news.2007.175}}</ref>\n\nThe analysis team stated that they should be able to achieve most of their primary science goals.

Scientists desire a sample of the Sun because evidence suggests that the outer layer of the Sun preserves the composition of the early solar nebula. Therefore, knowing the elemental and isotopic composition of the outer layer of the Sun is effectively the same as knowing the elemental and isotopic composition of the solar nebula. The data can be used to model how planets and other Solar System objects formed, and then extend those results to understanding [[stellar evolution]] and the formation of [[planetary system]]s elsewhere in the universe.\n\nClearly, the ideal sample collection option would be to send a spacecraft to the [[Sun]] itself and collect some solar plasma; however, that is difficult because of the intense heat of the Sun's superheated gases, as well as the dynamic electromagnetic environment of the solar [[corona]], whose flares regularly interfere with the electronics of distant spacecraft. Fortunately, the Sun continuously sheds some of its outer layer in the form of [[solar wind]].\n\nAccordingly, in order to meet the mission science objectives, the ''Genesis'' spacecraft was designed to collect solar wind [[ion]]s and return them to Earth for analysis.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Genesis Discovery Mission: Return of Solar Matter to Earth |journal=Space Science Reviews |first1=D.

The development of the trajectory for the mission was led by [[Martin Lo]].

As the capsule was approaching Earth and at the first stages of re-entry, all appeared well.\n\nExtensive planning had been conducted for the capsule's retrieval. A normal [[parachute]] landing might have damaged the delicate samples, so the mission design called for a [[mid-air retrieval]] of the sample return capsule. About {{convert|33|km|mi|abbr=on}} above the ground, a [[drogue parachute]] was to be deployed to slow descent. Then, at a height of {{convert|6.7|km|mi|abbr=on}}, a large [[parafoil]] was to be deployed to slow descent further and leave the capsule in stable flight. A [[helicopter]], with a second helicopter as a backup, was then to attempt to catch the capsule by its parachute on the end of a five-meter hook. Once retrieved, the capsule would have been soft-landed.\n\nThe sample return capsule entered Earth's atmosphere over northern [[Oregon]] at 16:55&nbsp;UTC on September 8, 2004, with a velocity of approximately {{convert|24706|mph|km/s|2|order=flip|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"jpl_hist\"/> Due to a design flaw in a deceleration sensor, parachute deployment was never triggered, and the spacecraft's descent was slowed only by its own [[air resistance]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/149414main_Genesis_MIB.pdf |title=Genesis Mishap Investigation Board Report: Volume 1 |publisher=NASA |first=Michael |last=Ryschkewitsch |display-authors=etal |format=PDF |date=June 13, 2006 |accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> The planned mid-air retrieval could not be carried out, and the capsule crashed into the desert floor of the [[Dugway Proving Ground]] in [[Tooele County, Utah]], at about {{convert|86|m/s|km/h mph|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe capsule broke open on impact, and part of the inner sample capsule was also breached. The damage was less severe than might have been expected given its velocity; it was to some extent cushioned by falling into fairly soft ground.\n\nUnfired pyrotechnic devices in the parachute deployment system and toxic gases from the batteries delayed the recovery team's approach to the crash site. After all was made safe, the damaged sample-return capsule was secured and moved to a clean room for inspection; simultaneously a crew of trained personnel scoured the site for collector fragments and sampled the local desert soil to archive as a reference by which to identify possible contaminants in the future. Recovery efforts by ''Genesis'' team members at the [[Utah Test and Training Range]] \u2013 which included inspecting, cataloging and packaging various collectors \u2013 took four weeks.<ref>{{cite paper |url=http://research.jsc.nasa.gov/PDF/Ares-5.pdf |title=Genesis Recovery Processing |publisher=NASA/JSC |first=E.

The MIB started its work on September 10, 2004, when it arrived at Dugway Proving Ground. It determined that all scientific hardware meant to be curated by the Johnson Space Center could be released and were not needed for the work of the board. Both JPL and Lockheed Martin began to prepare flight data and other records for the MIB.\n\nIt was announced by the MIB on September 20, 2004, that the capsule, having had the science material extracted, would be moved to the Lockheed Martin Space Systems facility near [[Denver, Colorado]], for MIB use.<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://genesismission.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/MIBstatus_report1.html |title=Genesis Mishap Investigation Board Status Report #1 |publisher=NASA |first=Donald |last=Savage |date=September 20, 2004 |accessdate=May 19, 2014 |id=04-306}}</ref>\n\nA first possible root cause of the failed deployment of the parachutes was announced in an October 14 press release.

The intended design was to make an electrical contact inside the sensor at {{convert|3|g-force|lk=on}}, maintaining it through the maximum expected {{convert|30|g-force|lk=on}}, and breaking the contact again at 3&nbsp;''g'' to start the parachute release sequence.

It will stop every [[water crisis]] at once.\nHowever, there will be quite a number of [[disadvantage]]s.\nFirstly, more [[fish]] will appear.\nWhy?\nBecause we would have nothing to [[drink]], and would get dehydrated.\nSecondly, more [[zooplankton]] and [[phytoplankton]] will appear, too.\nWhy?\nBecause some of the [[water]] creatures would be happy, but some of them...\nwouldn't.\nThirdly, we would have to turn everything back to normal to avoid [[dehydration]].\nLastly, we would have someone to help us.\nHowever, as more [[research]] is required, [[expert]]s don't know what will exactly happen if all the [[freshwater]] becomes [[seawater]].\n\n<br />\n\n== What if we drink ''seawater''? ==\n[[Seawater]] has [[salinity]] of about 3.5%. When we drink seawater, our [[kidneys]] remove the excess [[salt]]. We feel [[thirst]]y after drinking [[seawater]].

Utopia to-day, flesh and blood tomorrow. - [[Victor Hugo]]\n* A map of the world that does not include Utopia is not worth even glancing at, for it leaves out the one country at which Humanity is always landing. And when Humanity lands there, it looks out, and, seeing a better country, sets sail. Progress is the realisation of Utopias. - [[Oscar Wilde]]\n* Utopias are often only premature truths. - [[Alphonse De Lamartine]]\n* None of the abstract concepts comes closer to fulfilled utopia than that of eternal peace. - [[Theodor W. Adorno]]\n* I think that there is always a part of utopia in any romantic relationship. - [[Pedro Almodovar]]\n* In ourselves alone the absolute light keeps shining, a sigillum falsi et sui, mortis et vitae aeternae [false signal and signal of eternal life and death itself], and the fantastic move to it begins: to the external interpretation of the daydream, the cosmic manipulation of a concept that is utopian in principle. - [[Ernst Bloch]]\n* When I die, I want to die in a Utopia that I have helped to build. - [[Henry Kuttner]] \n\n* A man must be far gone in Utopian speculations who can seriously doubt that if these [United] States should either be wholly disunited, or only united in partial confederacies, the subdivisions into which they might be thrown would have frequent and violent contests with each other.\u201d [Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 6].\n\nUtopian socialist [[Etienne Cabet]] in his utopian book [[The Voyage to Icaria]] cited definition from contemporary ''Dictionary of ethical and political sciences'': \"Utopias and other models of government, based on the public good, may be inconceivable because of the disordered human passions which, under the wrong governments, seek to highlight the poorly conceived or selfish interest of the community. But even though we find it impossible, they are ridiculous to sinful people whose sense of self-destruction prevents them from believing.\" ([[The Voyage to Icaria]])\n\n[[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Engels, Friedrich, 1820-1895|Engels]] used the word utopia to denote unscientific social theories.<ref>Frederick Engels.

There are two false meanings of utopia one is this old notion of imagining this ideal society we know will never be realized, the other is the capitalist utopia in the sense of new perversed desire that you are not only allowed but even solicited to realize. The true utopia is when the situation is so without issue, without the way to resolve it within the coordinates of the possible that out of the pure urge of survival you have to invent a new space. Utopia is not kind of a free [[imagination]] utopia is a matter of inner most urgency, you are forced to imagine it, it is the only way out, and this is what we need today.\"<ref>http://maquinasdefuego.blogspot.com/2011/08/slavoj-zizek-on-utopia.html</ref>\n\nPhilosopher [[Milan \u0160ime\u010dka]] told: \u201c... utopism was a common type of thinking at the dawn of human [[civilization]].

The wisdom of these rulers will supposedly eliminate poverty and deprivation through fairly distributed resources, though the details on how to do this are unclear. The educational program for the rulers is the central notion of the proposal. It has few laws, no [[lawyer]]s and rarely sends its citizens to war but hires [[mercenary|mercenaries]] from among its war-prone neighbors. These mercenaries were deliberately sent into dangerous situations in the hope that the more warlike populations of all surrounding countries will be weeded out, leaving peaceful peoples.\n\nDuring the 16th century, Thomas More's book ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' proposed an ideal society of the same name.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item126618.html|title=Thomas More's Utopia |website=www.bl.uk |accessdate=14 May 2017}}</ref> Readers, including Utopian socialists, have chosen to accept this imaginary society as the realistic blueprint for a working nation, while others have postulated that Thomas More intended nothing of the sort.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.utopiaanddystopia.com/utopia/utopian-socialism/ |title=Utopian Socialism |publisher=The Utopian Socialism Movement |website=www.utopiaanddystopia.com |accessdate=14 May 2017}}</ref> It is believed that More's ''Utopia'' functions only on the level of a satire, a work intended to reveal more about the [[England]] of his time than about an idealistic society.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dalley |first=Jan |url=https://www.ft.com/content/73b9bed6-a7ea-11e5-955c-1e1d6de94879 |title=Openings: Going back to Utopia |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=30 December 2015 |accessdate=27 August 2018}}</ref> This interpretation is bolstered by the title of the book and nation and its apparent confusion between the Greek for \"no place\" and \"good place\": \"utopia\" is a compound of the syllable ou-, meaning \"no\" and topos, meaning place.

These ideas are often grouped in a greater \"[[utopian socialism|utopian socialist]]\" movement, due to their shared characteristics. A once common characteristic is an [[egalitarian]] distribution of goods, frequently with the total abolition of [[money]]. Citizens only do [[labour (economics)|work]] which they enjoy and which is for the [[common good]], leaving them with ample time for the cultivation of the arts and sciences. One classic example of such a utopia was [[Edward Bellamy]]'s ''[[Looking Backward]]''. Another socialist utopia is [[William Morris]]'s ''[[News from Nowhere]]'', written partially in response to the top-down ([[bureaucratic]]) nature of Bellamy's utopia, which Morris criticized. However, as the socialist movement developed, it moved away from utopianism; [[Marx]] in particular became a harsh critic of earlier socialism he described as utopian. (For more information, see the [[History of Socialism]] article.) In a materialist utopian society, the economy is perfect; there is no inflation and only perfect social and financial equality exists.\n\nIn 1905, [[H.G. Wells]] published ''[[A Modern Utopia]]'', which was widely read and admired and provoked much discussion. Also consider [[Eric Frank Russell]]'s book ''[[The Great Explosion]]'' (1963) whose last section details an economic and social utopia. This forms the first mention of the idea of [[Local Exchange Trading Systems]] (LETS).\n\nDuring the \"[[Khrushchev Thaw]]\" period,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/the-Thaw-Soviet-cultural-history|title=the Thaw \u2013 Soviet cultural history|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2017}}</ref> the Soviet writer [[Ivan Yefremov|Ivan Efremov]] produced the science-fiction utopia ''[[Andromeda (novel)|Andromeda]]'' (1957) in which a major cultural thaw took place: humanity communicates with a galaxy-wide Great Circle and develops its technology and culture within a social framework characterized by vigorous competition between alternative philosophies.\n\nThe English political philosopher [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], author of the utopian work [[The Commonwealth of Oceana]], published in 1656, inspired English [[Country Party (Britain)|country party]] republicanism and was influential in the design of three American colonies. His theories ultimately contributed to the idealistic principles of the American Founders. The colonies of [[Province of Carolina|Carolina]] (founded in 1670), [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]] (founded in 1681), and [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]] (founded in 1733) were the only three English colonies in America that were planned as utopian societies with an integrated physical, economic and social design. At the heart of the plan for Georgia was a concept of \u201cagrarian equality\u201d in which land was allocated equally and additional land acquisition through purchase or inheritance was prohibited; the plan was an early step toward the yeoman republic later envisioned by Thomas Jefferson.<ref>Fries, Sylvia, ''The Urban Idea in Colonial America'', Chapters 3 and 5</ref><ref>Home, Robert, ''Of Planting and Planning: The Making of British Colonial Cities'', 9</ref><ref>Wilson, Thomas, ''The Oglethorpe Plan'', Chapters 1 and 2</ref>\n\nThe communes of the 1960s in the United States were often an attempt to greatly improve the way humans live together in communities.

These utopian societies included the [[Shakers]], who originated in England in the 18th century and arrived in America in 1774. A number of religious utopian societies from Europe came to the United States from the 18th century throughout the 19th century, including the Society of the Woman in the Wilderness (led by [[Johannes Kelpius]] (1667\u20131708)), the [[Ephrata Cloister]] (established in 1732) and the [[Harmony Society]], among others.  The [[Harmony Society]] was a [[Christian theosophy]] and [[Pietism|pietist]] group founded in [[Iptingen]], [[Germany]], in 1785. Due to religious persecution by the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Church]] and the government in [[W\u00fcrttemberg]],<ref name=\"Sutton1\">Robert Paul Sutton, ''Communal Utopias and the American Experience: Religious Communities'' (2003) p. 38</ref> the society moved to the United States on October 7, 1803, settled in [[Pennsylvania]].  On February 15, 1805, about 400 followers formally organized the Harmony Society, placing all their [[Common ownership|goods in common]]. The group lasted until 1905, making it one of the longest-running financially successful communes in American history.\n\nThe [[Oneida Community]], founded by [[John Humphrey Noyes]] in [[Oneida, New York]], was a utopian religious [[commune]] that lasted from 1848 to 1881. Although this utopian experiment has become better known today for its manufacture of Oneida silverware, it was one of the longest-running communes in American history. The [[Amana Colonies]] were communal settlements in [[Iowa]], started by radical German [[pietists]], which lasted from 1855 to 1932. The [[Amana Corporation]], manufacturer of refrigerators and household appliances, was originally started by the group.

Technology has affected the way humans have lived to such an extent that normal functions, like sleep, eating or even reproduction, have been replaced by artificial means. Other examples include a society where humans have struck a balance with technology and it is merely used to enhance the human living condition (e.g. ''[[Star Trek]]''). In place of the static perfection of a utopia, [[libertarian transhumanist]]s envision an \"[[extropianism|extropia]]\", an open, evolving society allowing individuals and voluntary groupings to form the institutions and social forms they prefer.\n\n[[Mariah Utsawa]] presented a theoretical basis for [[technological utopianism]] and set out to develop a variety of technologies ranging from maps to designs for cars and houses which might lead to the development of such a utopia.\n\nOne notable example of a technological and [[libertarian socialist]] utopia is Scottish author [[Iain Banks]]' [[The Culture|Culture]].\n\nOpposing this [[optimism]] is the prediction that advanced science and technology will, through deliberate misuse or accident, cause environmental damage or even humanity's [[extinction]]. Critics, such as [[Jacques Ellul]] and [[Timothy Mitchell]] advocate [[precautionary principle|precautions]] against the premature embrace of new technologies. Both raise questions about changing responsibility and freedom brought by [[division of labour]]. Authors such as [[John Zerzan]] and [[Derrick Jensen]] consider that modern technology is progressively depriving humans of their autonomy and advocate the collapse of the industrial civilization, in favor of small-scale organization, as a necessary path to avoid the threat of technology on human freedom and [[sustainability]].\n\nThere are many examples of techno-dystopias portrayed in mainstream culture, such as the classics ''[[Brave New World]]'' and ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]],'' often published as \"1984\", which have explored some of these topics.\n\n===Feminism===\nUtopias have been used to explore the ramifications of genders being either a societal construct or a biologically \"hard-wired\" imperative or some mix of the two.<ref name=WSEncyc1442>{{cite book|title= Women's Studies Encyclopedia|last= Tierney|first= Helen|authorlink= |year= 1999|publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group|page= [https://archive.org/details/womensstudiesenc0001unse/page/1442 1442]|isbn= 978-0-313-31073-7|url= https://archive.org/details/womensstudiesenc0001unse/page/1442}}</ref> Socialist and economic utopias have tended to take the \"woman question\" seriously and often to offer some form of equality between the sexes as part and parcel of their vision, whether this be by addressing misogyny, reorganizing society along separatist lines, creating a certain kind of androgynous equality that ignores gender or in some other manner. For example, [[Edward Bellamy]]'s ''[[Looking Backward]]'' (1887) responded, progressively for his day, to the contemporary women's suffrage and women's rights movements. Bellamy supported these movements by incorporating the equality of women and men into his utopian world's structure, albeit by consigning women to a separate sphere of light industrial activity (due to women's lesser physical strength) and making various exceptions for them in order to make room for (and to praise) motherhood. One of the earlier feminist utopias that imagines complete separatism is [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]]'s ''[[Herland (novel)|Herland]]'' (1915).\n\nIn [[Gender in speculative fiction|science fiction and technological speculation]], gender can be challenged on the biological as well as the social level. [[Marge Piercy]]'s ''[[Woman on the Edge of Time]]'' portrays equality between the genders and complete equality in sexuality (regardless of the gender of the lovers).  Birth-giving, often felt as the divider that cannot be avoided in discussions of women's rights and roles, has been shifted onto elaborate biological machinery that functions to offer an enriched embryonic experience,  When a child is born, it spends most of its time in the children's ward with peers. Three \"mothers\" per child are the norm and they are chosen in a gender neutral way (men as well as women may become \"mothers\") on the basis of their experience and ability. Technological advances also make possible the freeing of women from childbearing in [[Shulamith Firestone]]'s ''[[The Dialectic of Sex]]''. The fictional aliens in [[Mary Gentle]]'s ''Golden Witchbreed'' start out as gender-neutral children and do not develop into men and women until puberty and gender has no bearing on social roles. In contrast, [[Doris Lessing]]'s ''[[The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five]]'' (1980) suggests that men's and women's values are inherent to the sexes and cannot be changed, making a compromise between them essential. In ''My Own Utopia'' (1961) by [[Elizabeth Mann Borghese]], gender exists but is dependent upon age rather than sex&nbsp;\u2013 genderless children mature into women, some of whom eventually become men.<ref name=WSEncyc1442/> \"[[William Moulton Marston|William Marston]]'s [[Wonder Woman]] comics of the 1940s featured Paradise Island, also known as [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]], a matriarchal all-female community of peace, loving submission, bondage and giant space kangaroos.\"<ref>Noah Berlatsky, \"Imagine There's No Gender: The Long History of Feminist Utopian Literature,\" ''The Atlantic,'' April 15, 2013. https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/04/imagine-theres-no-gender-the-long-history-of-feminist-utopian-literature/274993/</ref>\n\nUtopian [[single-gender worlds]] or single-sex societies have long been one of the primary ways to explore implications of gender and gender-differences.<ref name=DGinSF13/> In speculative fiction, female-only worlds have been imagined to come about by the action of disease that wipes out men, along with the development of technological or mystical method that allow female [[parthenogenic]] [[reproduction]].

In those days, the various [[mythology|myth]]s tell us, there was an instinctive harmony between humanity and nature. People's needs were few and their desires limited. Both were easily satisfied by the abundance provided by nature. Accordingly, there were no motives whatsoever for war or oppression. Nor was there any need for hard and painful work. Humans were simple and [[piety|pious]] and felt themselves close to their God or gods. According to one anthropological theory, hunter-gatherers were the [[original affluent society]].\n\nThese mythical or religious archetypes are inscribed in many cultures and resurge with special vitality when people are in difficult and critical times. However, in utopias, the projection of the myth does not take place towards the remote past but either towards the future or towards distant and fictional places, imagining that at some time in the future, at some point in space, or beyond death, there must exist the possibility of living happily.\n\nThese myths of the earliest stage of humankind have been referred to by various cultures, societies and religions:\n\n====Golden Age====\n\nThe [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] poet [[Hesiod]], around the 8th century BC, in his compilation of the mythological tradition (the poem ''[[Works and Days]]''), explained that, prior to [[Ages of Man|the present era]], there were four other progressively more perfect ones, the oldest of which was the [[Golden Age]].\n\n[[Plutarch]], the Greek historian and biographer of the 1st century, dealt with the blissful and mythic past of the humanity.\n\n====Arcadia====\n\nFrom [[Sir Philip Sidney]]'s prose romance ''[[Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia|The Old Arcadia]]'' (1580), originally a region in the [[Peloponnesus]], [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]] became a [[synonym]] for any rural area that serves as a [[pastoral]] setting, a ''locus amoenus'' (\"delightful place\").\n\n====The Biblical Garden of Eden====\n\nThe [[Hebrew Bible|Biblical]] [[Garden of Eden]] as depicted in the [[Old Testament]] [[Bible]]'s [[Book of Genesis]] 2 ([[King James Version of the Bible|Authorized Version of 1611]]):\n\n<blockquote>\"And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed. Out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food; the [[Tree of life (biblical)|tree of life]] also in the midst of the garden and the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|tree of knowledge of good and evil]]. [...]<br />\n<br />\nAnd the Lord God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. [...]<br />\n<br />\nAnd the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; [...] And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept: and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman and brought her unto the man.\"</blockquote>\n\nAccording to the exegesis that the biblical theologian [[Herbert Haag]] proposes in the book ''Is original sin in Scripture?'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Haag |first=Herbert |authorlink=Herbert Haag |title=Is original sin in Scripture? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zO_YAAAAMAAJ |year=1969 |publisher=[[Sheed and Ward]] |location=New York}} [[German language|German]] or. ed.: [https://books.google.com/books?id=EnWRSQAACAAJ 1966].</ref> published soon after the [[Second Vatican Council]], {{bibleref2|Genesis 2:25||NIV}} would indicate that [[Adam and Eve]] were created from the beginning naked of the [[divine grace]], an originary grace that, then, they would never have had and even less would have lost due to the subsequent events narrated. On the other hand, while supporting a continuity in the Bible about the absence of [[preternatural]] gifts ({{lang-la|dona praeternaturalia}})<ref>{{in lang|de}} Haag, Herbert (1966). pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=nUMaAAAAMAAJ&q=%22dona+praeternaturalia%22 9, 49ff.]</ref> with regard to the [[Serpents in the Bible#Eden|ophitic event]], Haag never makes any reference to the discontinuity of the loss of access to the tree of life.\n\n====The Land of Cockaigne====\n\nThe Land of [[Cockaigne]] (also Cockaygne, Cokaygne), was an imaginary land of idleness and luxury, famous in medieval stories and the subject of several poems, one of which, an early translation of a 13th-century French work, is given in [[George Ellis (poet)|George Ellis']] ''Specimens of Early English Poets''. In this, \"the houses were made of barley sugar and cakes, the streets were paved with pastry and the shops supplied goods for nothing.\"  London has been so called (see [[Cockney#Cockaigne|Cockney]]) but Boileau applies the same to Paris.<ref>Cobham Brewer E.

The main description of it is found in the Chinese [[Classic of Rites]], in the chapter called \"Li Yun\" (\u79ae\u904b).  Later, Datong and its ideal of 'The World Belongs to Everyone/The World is Held in Common' 'Tianxia weigong/\u5929\u4e0b\u4e3a\u516c' 'influenced modern Chinese reformers and revolutionaries, such as [[Kang Youwei]].\n\n====Schlaraffenland====\n\n[[Schlaraffenland]] is an analogous German tradition.\n\nAll these myths also express some hope that the [[idyll]]ic state of affairs they describe is not irretrievably and irrevocably lost to mankind, that it can be regained in some way or other.\n\nOne way might be a quest for an \"earthly paradise\"&nbsp;\u2013 a place like [[Shangri-La]], hidden in the [[Tibet]]an mountains and described by [[James Hilton (novelist)|James Hilton]] in his utopian novel ''[[Lost Horizon (novel)|Lost Horizon]]'' (1933).

Utopia to-day, flesh and blood tomorrow. - [[Victor Hugo]]\n* A map of the world that does not include Utopia is not worth even glancing at, for it leaves out the one country at which Humanity is always landing. And when Humanity lands there, it looks out, and, seeing a better country, sets sail. Progress is the realisation of Utopias. - [[Oscar Wilde]]\n* Utopias are often only premature truths. - [[Alphonse De Lamartine]]\n* None of the abstract concepts comes closer to fulfilled utopia than that of eternal peace. - [[Theodor W. Adorno]]\n* I think that there is always a part of utopia in any romantic relationship. - [[Pedro Almodovar]]\n* In ourselves alone the absolute light keeps shining, a sigillum falsi et sui, mortis et vitae aeternae [false signal and signal of eternal life and death itself], and the fantastic move to it begins: to the external interpretation of the daydream, the cosmic manipulation of a concept that is utopian in principle. - [[Ernst Bloch]]\n* When I die, I want to die in a Utopia that I have helped to build. - [[Henry Kuttner]] \n\n* A man must be far gone in Utopian speculations who can seriously doubt that if these [United] States should either be wholly disunited, or only united in partial confederacies, the subdivisions into which they might be thrown would have frequent and violent contests with each other.\u201d [Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 6].\n\nUtopian socialist [[Etienne Cabet]] in his utopian book [[The Voyage to Icaria]] cited definition from contemporary ''Dictionary of ethical and political sciences'': \"Utopias and other models of government, based on the public good, may be inconceivable because of the disordered human passions which, under the wrong governments, seek to highlight the poorly conceived or selfish interest of the community. But even though we find it impossible, they are ridiculous to sinful people whose sense of self-destruction prevents them from believing.\" ([[The Voyage to Icaria]])\n\n[[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Engels, Friedrich, 1820-1895|Engels]] used the word utopia to denote unscientific social theories.<ref>Frederick Engels. Socialism: Utopian and Scientific.</ref>\n\nPhilosopher [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek]] told about utopia: \"Which means that we should reinvent utopia but in what sense. There are two false meanings of utopia one is this old notion of imagining this ideal society we know will never be realized, the other is the capitalist utopia in the sense of new perversed desire that you are not only allowed but even solicited to realize. The true utopia is when the situation is so without issue, without the way to resolve it within the coordinates of the possible that out of the pure urge of survival you have to invent a new space. Utopia is not kind of a free [[imagination]] utopia is a matter of inner most urgency, you are forced to imagine it, it is the only way out, and this is what we need today.\"<ref>http://maquinasdefuego.blogspot.com/2011/08/slavoj-zizek-on-utopia.html</ref>\n\nPhilosopher [[Milan \u0160ime\u010dka]] told: \u201c... utopism was a common type of thinking at the dawn of human [[civilization]].

The wisdom of these rulers will supposedly eliminate poverty and deprivation through fairly distributed resources, though the details on how to do this are unclear. The educational program for the rulers is the central notion of the proposal. It has few laws, no [[lawyer]]s and rarely sends its citizens to war but hires [[mercenary|mercenaries]] from among its war-prone neighbors. These mercenaries were deliberately sent into dangerous situations in the hope that the more warlike populations of all surrounding countries will be weeded out, leaving peaceful peoples.\n\nDuring the 16th century, Thomas More's book ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' proposed an ideal society of the same name.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item126618.html|title=Thomas More's Utopia |website=www.bl.uk |accessdate=14 May 2017}}</ref> Readers, including Utopian socialists, have chosen to accept this imaginary society as the realistic blueprint for a working nation, while others have postulated that Thomas More intended nothing of the sort.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.utopiaanddystopia.com/utopia/utopian-socialism/ |title=Utopian Socialism |publisher=The Utopian Socialism Movement |website=www.utopiaanddystopia.com |accessdate=14 May 2017}}</ref> It is believed that More's ''Utopia'' functions only on the level of a satire, a work intended to reveal more about the [[England]] of his time than about an idealistic society.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dalley |first=Jan |url=https://www.ft.com/content/73b9bed6-a7ea-11e5-955c-1e1d6de94879 |title=Openings: Going back to Utopia |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=30 December 2015 |accessdate=27 August 2018}}</ref> This interpretation is bolstered by the title of the book and nation and its apparent confusion between the Greek for \"no place\" and \"good place\": \"utopia\" is a compound of the syllable ou-, meaning \"no\" and topos, meaning place.

These ideas are often grouped in a greater \"[[utopian socialism|utopian socialist]]\" movement, due to their shared characteristics. A once common characteristic is an [[egalitarian]] distribution of goods, frequently with the total abolition of [[money]]. Citizens only do [[labour (economics)|work]] which they enjoy and which is for the [[common good]], leaving them with ample time for the cultivation of the arts and sciences. One classic example of such a utopia was [[Edward Bellamy]]'s ''[[Looking Backward]]''. Another socialist utopia is [[William Morris]]'s ''[[News from Nowhere]]'', written partially in response to the top-down ([[bureaucratic]]) nature of Bellamy's utopia, which Morris criticized. However, as the socialist movement developed, it moved away from utopianism; [[Marx]] in particular became a harsh critic of earlier socialism he described as utopian. (For more information, see the [[History of Socialism]] article.) In a materialist utopian society, the economy is perfect; there is no inflation and only perfect social and financial equality exists.\n\nIn 1905, [[H.G. Wells]] published ''[[A Modern Utopia]]'', which was widely read and admired and provoked much discussion. Also consider [[Eric Frank Russell]]'s book ''[[The Great Explosion]]'' (1963) whose last section details an economic and social utopia. This forms the first mention of the idea of [[Local Exchange Trading Systems]] (LETS).\n\nDuring the \"[[Khrushchev Thaw]]\" period,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/the-Thaw-Soviet-cultural-history|title=the Thaw \u2013 Soviet cultural history|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2017}}</ref> the Soviet writer [[Ivan Yefremov|Ivan Efremov]] produced the science-fiction utopia ''[[Andromeda (novel)|Andromeda]]'' (1957) in which a major cultural thaw took place: humanity communicates with a galaxy-wide Great Circle and develops its technology and culture within a social framework characterized by vigorous competition between alternative philosophies.\n\nThe English political philosopher [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], author of the utopian work [[The Commonwealth of Oceana]], published in 1656, inspired English [[Country Party (Britain)|country party]] republicanism and was influential in the design of three American colonies. His theories ultimately contributed to the idealistic principles of the American Founders. The colonies of [[Province of Carolina|Carolina]] (founded in 1670), [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]] (founded in 1681), and [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]] (founded in 1733) were the only three English colonies in America that were planned as utopian societies with an integrated physical, economic and social design. At the heart of the plan for Georgia was a concept of \u201cagrarian equality\u201d in which land was allocated equally and additional land acquisition through purchase or inheritance was prohibited; the plan was an early step toward the yeoman republic later envisioned by Thomas Jefferson.<ref>Fries, Sylvia, ''The Urban Idea in Colonial America'', Chapters 3 and 5</ref><ref>Home, Robert, ''Of Planting and Planning: The Making of British Colonial Cities'', 9</ref><ref>Wilson, Thomas, ''The Oglethorpe Plan'', Chapters 1 and 2</ref>\n\nThe communes of the 1960s in the United States were often an attempt to greatly improve the way humans live together in communities. The back-to-the-land movements and hippies inspired many to try to live in peace and harmony on farms, remote areas and to set up new types of governance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://brbl-archive.library.yale.edu/exhibitions/utopia/uc22.html|title=America and the Utopian Dream \u2013 Utopian Communities|website=brbl-archive.library.yale.edu|accessdate=14 May 2017}}</ref> Communes like [[Kaliflower Commune|Kaliflower]], which existed between 1967 and 1973, attempted to live outside of society's norms and create their own ideal communist based society.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://secure.pmpress.org/index.php?l=product_detail&p=432|title=For All the People: Uncovering the Hidden History of Cooperation, Cooperative Movements and Communalism in America, 2nd Edition|website=secure.pmpress.org|access-date=2017-04-26}}</ref>\n\n[[Intentional communities]] were organized and built all over the world with the hope of making a more perfect way of living together.

These utopian societies included the [[Shakers]], who originated in England in the 18th century and arrived in America in 1774. A number of religious utopian societies from Europe came to the United States from the 18th century throughout the 19th century, including the Society of the Woman in the Wilderness (led by [[Johannes Kelpius]] (1667\u20131708)), the [[Ephrata Cloister]] (established in 1732) and the [[Harmony Society]], among others.  The [[Harmony Society]] was a [[Christian theosophy]] and [[Pietism|pietist]] group founded in [[Iptingen]], [[Germany]], in 1785. Due to religious persecution by the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Church]] and the government in [[W\u00fcrttemberg]],<ref name=\"Sutton1\">Robert Paul Sutton, ''Communal Utopias and the American Experience: Religious Communities'' (2003) p. 38</ref> the society moved to the United States on October 7, 1803, settled in [[Pennsylvania]].  On February 15, 1805, about 400 followers formally organized the Harmony Society, placing all their [[Common ownership|goods in common]]. The group lasted until 1905, making it one of the longest-running financially successful communes in American history.\n\nThe [[Oneida Community]], founded by [[John Humphrey Noyes]] in [[Oneida, New York]], was a utopian religious [[commune]] that lasted from 1848 to 1881. Although this utopian experiment has become better known today for its manufacture of Oneida silverware, it was one of the longest-running communes in American history. The [[Amana Colonies]] were communal settlements in [[Iowa]], started by radical German [[pietists]], which lasted from 1855 to 1932. The [[Amana Corporation]], manufacturer of refrigerators and household appliances, was originally started by the group.

Technology has affected the way humans have lived to such an extent that normal functions, like sleep, eating or even reproduction, have been replaced by artificial means. Other examples include a society where humans have struck a balance with technology and it is merely used to enhance the human living condition (e.g. ''[[Star Trek]]''). In place of the static perfection of a utopia, [[libertarian transhumanist]]s envision an \"[[extropianism|extropia]]\", an open, evolving society allowing individuals and voluntary groupings to form the institutions and social forms they prefer.\n\n[[Mariah Utsawa]] presented a theoretical basis for [[technological utopianism]] and set out to develop a variety of technologies ranging from maps to designs for cars and houses which might lead to the development of such a utopia.\n\nOne notable example of a technological and [[libertarian socialist]] utopia is Scottish author [[Iain Banks]]' [[The Culture|Culture]].\n\nOpposing this [[optimism]] is the prediction that advanced science and technology will, through deliberate misuse or accident, cause environmental damage or even humanity's [[extinction]]. Critics, such as [[Jacques Ellul]] and [[Timothy Mitchell]] advocate [[precautionary principle|precautions]] against the premature embrace of new technologies. Both raise questions about changing responsibility and freedom brought by [[division of labour]]. Authors such as [[John Zerzan]] and [[Derrick Jensen]] consider that modern technology is progressively depriving humans of their autonomy and advocate the collapse of the industrial civilization, in favor of small-scale organization, as a necessary path to avoid the threat of technology on human freedom and [[sustainability]].\n\nThere are many examples of techno-dystopias portrayed in mainstream culture, such as the classics ''[[Brave New World]]'' and ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]],'' often published as \"1984\", which have explored some of these topics.\n\n===Feminism===\nUtopias have been used to explore the ramifications of genders being either a societal construct or a biologically \"hard-wired\" imperative or some mix of the two.<ref name=WSEncyc1442>{{cite book|title= Women's Studies Encyclopedia|last= Tierney|first= Helen|authorlink= |year= 1999|publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group|page= [https://archive.org/details/womensstudiesenc0001unse/page/1442 1442]|isbn= 978-0-313-31073-7|url= https://archive.org/details/womensstudiesenc0001unse/page/1442}}</ref> Socialist and economic utopias have tended to take the \"woman question\" seriously and often to offer some form of equality between the sexes as part and parcel of their vision, whether this be by addressing misogyny, reorganizing society along separatist lines, creating a certain kind of androgynous equality that ignores gender or in some other manner. For example, [[Edward Bellamy]]'s ''[[Looking Backward]]'' (1887) responded, progressively for his day, to the contemporary women's suffrage and women's rights movements. Bellamy supported these movements by incorporating the equality of women and men into his utopian world's structure, albeit by consigning women to a separate sphere of light industrial activity (due to women's lesser physical strength) and making various exceptions for them in order to make room for (and to praise) motherhood. One of the earlier feminist utopias that imagines complete separatism is [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]]'s ''[[Herland (novel)|Herland]]'' (1915).\n\nIn [[Gender in speculative fiction|science fiction and technological speculation]], gender can be challenged on the biological as well as the social level. [[Marge Piercy]]'s ''[[Woman on the Edge of Time]]'' portrays equality between the genders and complete equality in sexuality (regardless of the gender of the lovers).  Birth-giving, often felt as the divider that cannot be avoided in discussions of women's rights and roles, has been shifted onto elaborate biological machinery that functions to offer an enriched embryonic experience,  When a child is born, it spends most of its time in the children's ward with peers. Three \"mothers\" per child are the norm and they are chosen in a gender neutral way (men as well as women may become \"mothers\") on the basis of their experience and ability. Technological advances also make possible the freeing of women from childbearing in [[Shulamith Firestone]]'s ''[[The Dialectic of Sex]]''. The fictional aliens in [[Mary Gentle]]'s ''Golden Witchbreed'' start out as gender-neutral children and do not develop into men and women until puberty and gender has no bearing on social roles. In contrast, [[Doris Lessing]]'s ''[[The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five]]'' (1980) suggests that men's and women's values are inherent to the sexes and cannot be changed, making a compromise between them essential. In ''My Own Utopia'' (1961) by [[Elizabeth Mann Borghese]], gender exists but is dependent upon age rather than sex&nbsp;\u2013 genderless children mature into women, some of whom eventually become men.<ref name=WSEncyc1442/> \"[[William Moulton Marston|William Marston]]'s [[Wonder Woman]] comics of the 1940s featured Paradise Island, also known as [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]], a matriarchal all-female community of peace, loving submission, bondage and giant space kangaroos.\"<ref>Noah Berlatsky, \"Imagine There's No Gender: The Long History of Feminist Utopian Literature,\" ''The Atlantic,'' April 15, 2013. https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/04/imagine-theres-no-gender-the-long-history-of-feminist-utopian-literature/274993/</ref>\n\nUtopian [[single-gender worlds]] or single-sex societies have long been one of the primary ways to explore implications of gender and gender-differences.<ref name=DGinSF13/> In speculative fiction, female-only worlds have been imagined to come about by the action of disease that wipes out men, along with the development of technological or mystical method that allow female [[parthenogenic]] [[reproduction]].

In those days, the various [[mythology|myth]]s tell us, there was an instinctive harmony between humanity and nature. People's needs were few and their desires limited. Both were easily satisfied by the abundance provided by nature. Accordingly, there were no motives whatsoever for war or oppression. Nor was there any need for hard and painful work. Humans were simple and [[piety|pious]] and felt themselves close to their God or gods. According to one anthropological theory, hunter-gatherers were the [[original affluent society]].\n\nThese mythical or religious archetypes are inscribed in many cultures and resurge with special vitality when people are in difficult and critical times. However, in utopias, the projection of the myth does not take place towards the remote past but either towards the future or towards distant and fictional places, imagining that at some time in the future, at some point in space, or beyond death, there must exist the possibility of living happily.\n\nThese myths of the earliest stage of humankind have been referred to by various cultures, societies and religions:\n\n====Golden Age====\n\nThe [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] poet [[Hesiod]], around the 8th century BC, in his compilation of the mythological tradition (the poem ''[[Works and Days]]''), explained that, prior to [[Ages of Man|the present era]], there were four other progressively more perfect ones, the oldest of which was the [[Golden Age]].\n\n[[Plutarch]], the Greek historian and biographer of the 1st century, dealt with the blissful and mythic past of the humanity.\n\n====Arcadia====\n\nFrom [[Sir Philip Sidney]]'s prose romance ''[[Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia|The Old Arcadia]]'' (1580), originally a region in the [[Peloponnesus]], [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]] became a [[synonym]] for any rural area that serves as a [[pastoral]] setting, a ''locus amoenus'' (\"delightful place\").\n\n====The Biblical Garden of Eden====\n\nThe [[Hebrew Bible|Biblical]] [[Garden of Eden]] as depicted in the [[Old Testament]] [[Bible]]'s [[Book of Genesis]] 2 ([[King James Version of the Bible|Authorized Version of 1611]]):\n\n<blockquote>\"And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed. Out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food; the [[Tree of life (biblical)|tree of life]] also in the midst of the garden and the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|tree of knowledge of good and evil]]. [...]<br />\n<br />\nAnd the Lord God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. [...]<br />\n<br />\nAnd the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; [...] And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept: and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman and brought her unto the man.\"</blockquote>\n\nAccording to the exegesis that the biblical theologian [[Herbert Haag]] proposes in the book ''Is original sin in Scripture?'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Haag |first=Herbert |authorlink=Herbert Haag |title=Is original sin in Scripture? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zO_YAAAAMAAJ |year=1969 |publisher=[[Sheed and Ward]] |location=New York}} [[German language|German]] or. ed.: [https://books.google.com/books?id=EnWRSQAACAAJ 1966].</ref> published soon after the [[Second Vatican Council]], {{bibleref2|Genesis 2:25||NIV}} would indicate that [[Adam and Eve]] were created from the beginning naked of the [[divine grace]], an originary grace that, then, they would never have had and even less would have lost due to the subsequent events narrated. On the other hand, while supporting a continuity in the Bible about the absence of [[preternatural]] gifts ({{lang-la|dona praeternaturalia}})<ref>{{in lang|de}} Haag, Herbert (1966). pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=nUMaAAAAMAAJ&q=%22dona+praeternaturalia%22 9, 49ff.]</ref> with regard to the [[Serpents in the Bible#Eden|ophitic event]], Haag never makes any reference to the discontinuity of the loss of access to the tree of life.\n\n====The Land of Cockaigne====\n\nThe Land of [[Cockaigne]] (also Cockaygne, Cokaygne), was an imaginary land of idleness and luxury, famous in medieval stories and the subject of several poems, one of which, an early translation of a 13th-century French work, is given in [[George Ellis (poet)|George Ellis']] ''Specimens of Early English Poets''. In this, \"the houses were made of barley sugar and cakes, the streets were paved with pastry and the shops supplied goods for nothing.\"  London has been so called (see [[Cockney#Cockaigne|Cockney]]) but Boileau applies the same to Paris.<ref>Cobham Brewer E.

The main description of it is found in the Chinese [[Classic of Rites]], in the chapter called \"Li Yun\" (\u79ae\u904b).  Later, Datong and its ideal of 'The World Belongs to Everyone/The World is Held in Common' 'Tianxia weigong/\u5929\u4e0b\u4e3a\u516c' 'influenced modern Chinese reformers and revolutionaries, such as [[Kang Youwei]].\n\n====Schlaraffenland====\n\n[[Schlaraffenland]] is an analogous German tradition.\n\nAll these myths also express some hope that the [[idyll]]ic state of affairs they describe is not irretrievably and irrevocably lost to mankind, that it can be regained in some way or other.\n\nOne way might be a quest for an \"earthly paradise\"&nbsp;\u2013 a place like [[Shangri-La]], hidden in the [[Tibet]]an mountains and described by [[James Hilton (novelist)|James Hilton]] in his utopian novel ''[[Lost Horizon (novel)|Lost Horizon]]'' (1933).

On 16 June it moved by [[railroad|rail]] to [[Toul]], France to take a position on the front lines in the French sector. Its soldiers were issued French weapons and equipment to simplify resupply.<ref name=\"GSOhist\" /> The division was briefly assigned to [[I Corps (United States)|I Corps]] before falling under the command of [[IV Corps (United States)|IV Corps]] until late August.

On 13 September, the 163rd Infantry Brigade and 327th Infantry Regiment raided and patrolled to the northeast of [[Port-sur-Seille]], toward [[Eply]], in the [[Bois de Cheminot]], Bois de la Voivrotte, Bois de la T\u00eate-d'Or, and [[Bois Fr\u00e9haut]]. Meanwhile, the 328th Infantry Regiment, in connection with the attack of the [[90th Infantry Division (United States)|90th Division]] against the Bois-le-Pr\u00eatre, advanced on the west of the [[Moselle River]], and, in contact with the 90th Division, entered [[Norroy-l\u00e8s-Pont-\u00e0-Mousson|Norroy]], advancing to the heights just north of that town where it consolidated its position. On 15 September, the 328th Infantry, in order to protect the 90th Division's flank, resumed the advance, and reached [[Vandi\u00e8res, Meurthe-et-Moselle|Vandi\u00e8res]], but withdrew on the following day to the high ground north of Norroy.<ref name=\"wwihist\" />\n\nOn 17 September, the St-Mihiel Operation stabilized, and the 90th Division relieved the 82nd's troops west of the Moselle River. On 20 September, the 82nd was relieved by the French 69th Infantry Division, and moved to the vicinity of [[Marbache]] and [[Belleville, Meurthe-et-Moselle|Belleville]], then to stations near [[Triaucourt]] and [[Rar\u00e9court]] in the area of the First Army.<ref name=\"wwihist\" /> During this operation, the division suffered heavy casualties from enemy artillery.

Duncan]], former commander of the 77th Division, relieved Burnham on 3{{nbsp}}October, and Burnham subsequently served as military attach\u00e9 in [[Athens, Greece]]. On the night of 6/7 October 1918, the 164th Infantry Brigade relieved troops of the [[28th Division (United States)|28th Division]], which were holding the front line from south of [[Fl\u00e9ville]] to [[La Forge, Vosges|La Forge]], along the eastern bank of the [[Aire (Aisne)|Aire River]]. The 163rd Infantry Brigade remained in reserve. On 7{{nbsp}}October the division, minus the 163rd Infantry Brigade, attacked the northeastern edge of the [[Forest of Argonne|Argonne Forest]], making some progress toward [[Cornay]], and occupied Hill 180 and Hill 223. The next day it resumed the attack. Elements of the division's right flank entered Cornay but later withdrew to the east and south. The division's left flank reached the southeastern slope of the high ground northwest of [[Ch\u00e2tel-Ch\u00e9h\u00e9ry]]. On 9{{nbsp}}October, the division continued its attack, and advanced its left flank to a line from south of Pyl\u00f4ne to the [[Rau de la Louvi\u00e8re]].<ref name=\"wwihist\" />\n\nFor the rest of the month, the division turned to the north and advanced astride the Aire River to the region east of St-Juvin. On 10 October, it relieved troops of [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Division]] on the right, north of [[Fl\u00e9ville]], as far as a new boundary extending north and south through [[Sommerance]]. It then attacked and captured [[Cornay]] and [[Enghien|Marcq]], and established the front just to their south. On 11 October, the right flank of the division occupied Sommerance and the high ground north of la Rance Rau while the left advanced to the railroad south of the Aire. The next day, the [[42nd Division (United States)|42nd]] relieved the 82nd's troops in and near Sommerance, allowing it to resume the attack. The 82nd passed through part of the [[Hindenburg line|Hindenburg]] defensive position and reached a line just north of the road from St-Georges to St-Juvin.<ref name=\"wwihist\" />\n\nOn 18 October, the division relieved elements of the [[78th Division (United States)|78th]] as far to the left as Marcq and [[Champigneulle]]. Three days later it advanced to the Ravin aux Pierres. On 31 October, the 82nd, except the artillery, was relieved by the [[77th Division (United States)|77th Division]] and the [[80th Division (United States)|80th Division]], and assembled in the [[Forest of Argonne|Argonne Forest]] near Champ-Mahaut. On 2{{nbsp}}November, the division concentrated near La Chalade and [[Les Islettes]], and, on 4{{nbsp}}November, moved to training areas in [[Vaucouleurs]]. On 10 November, it moved again to training areas in [[Bourmont]], where it remained until the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|11 November armistice]].<ref name=\"wwihist\" /> During this campaign the division suffered another 7,000 killed and wounded.

It was recalled to active service on 25 March 1942, and reorganized at [[Camp Claiborne]], [[Louisiana]], under the command of [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Omar Bradley]]. During this training period, the division brought together three officers who would ultimately steer the U.S. Army during the following two decades: [[Matthew Ridgway]], [[James M. Gavin]], and [[Maxwell D. Taylor]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Blair|first=Clay|title=Ridgeway's Paratroopers The American Airborne in World War II|year=1985|publisher=Naval Institute Press|pages=Plate 11}}</ref> Under Major General Bradley, the 82nd Division's [[Chief of staff|Chief of Staff]] was [[George Van Pope]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Doyle|first=Charles H.|title=Stand in the Door!|year=1988|publisher=Phillips Publications|location=Williamstown, New Jersey|page=104|author2=Terrell Stewart}}</ref>\n\nOn 15 August 1942, the 82nd Infantry Division, now commanded by Major General Ridgway, became the first airborne division in the history of the U.S. Army, and was redesignated as the '''82nd Airborne Division'''. The division initially consisted of the [[325th Infantry Regiment (United States)|325th]], [[326th Infantry Regiment (United States)|326th]] and [[327th Infantry Regiment (United States)|327th Infantry Regiment]]s, and supporting units. The 327th was soon transferred to help form the [[101st Airborne Division]] and was replaced by the [[504th Infantry Regiment (United States)|504th Parachute Infantry Regiment]], leaving the division with two regiments of [[glider infantry]] and one of [[Paratrooper|parachute infantry]]. In February 1943 the division received another change when the 326th was transferred to the [[13th Airborne Division (United States)|13th Airborne Division]], being replaced by the [[505th Infantry Regiment (United States)|505th Parachute Infantry Regiment]], under James M. Gavin, then a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]], who was later destined to command the division.\n\n===Sicily and Italy===\n\nIn April 1943, after several months of tough training, its troopers deployed to the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations]], under the command of Major General Ridgway to take part in the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|campaign to invade Sicily]]. The division's first two combat operations were [[Paratrooper|parachute assault]]s into Sicily on 9{{nbsp}}July and [[Allied invasion of Italy#Salerno landings|Salerno]] on 13 September 1943. The initial assault on Sicily, by the 505th Parachute Regimental Combat Team, under Colonel Gavin, was the first regimental-sized combat parachute assault conducted by the United States Army. The first glider assault did not occur until [[Normandy landings|Operation Neptune]] as part of the [[Normandy landings|D-Day landings of 6 June 1944]]. Glider troopers of the [[319th Field Artillery Regiment|319th]] and [[320th Field Artillery Regiment|320th Glider Field Artillery Battalion]]s and the 325th Glider Infantry Regiment (and the 3rd Battalion of the 504th PIR) instead arrived in Italy by [[landing craft]] at Maiori (319th) and Salerno (320th, 325th).\n\nIn January 1944, the 504th, commanded by [[Reuben Henry Tucker III|Colonel Reuben Tucker]], which was temporarily detached to [[Battle of Anzio|fight at Anzio]], adopted the nickname \"Devils in Baggy Pants\", taken from an entry in a German officer's diary. The 504th was replaced in the division by the inexperienced [[507th Parachute Infantry Regiment (United States)|507th Parachute Infantry Regiment]], under the command of Colonel [[George V. Millet, Jr.]]. While the 504th was detached, the remainder of the 82nd Airborne Division moved to the [[United Kingdom]] in November 1943 to prepare for the liberation of Europe. See [[RAF North Witham]] and [[RAF Folkingham]].\n\n===Normandy===\n\nWith two combat drops under its belt, the 82nd Airborne Division was now ready for the most ambitious airborne operation of the war so far, as part of [[Normandy landings|Operation Neptune]], the Allied [[invasion of Normandy]]. The division conducted [[Mission Boston]], part of the airborne assault phase of the [[Operation Overlord]] plan.\n\nIn preparation for the operation, the division was significantly reorganized. To ease the integration of replacement troops, rest, and refitting following the fighting in Italy, the 504th PIR did not rejoin the division for the invasion. Two new parachute infantry regiments (PIRs), the [[507th Parachute Infantry Regiment (United States)|507th]] and the [[508th Infantry Regiment (United States)|508th]], provided it, along with the veteran 505th, a three-parachute infantry regiment punch. The 325th was also reinforced by the addition of the 3rd Battalion of the [[401st Infantry Regiment (United States)|401st GIR]], bringing it up to a strength of three battalions.\n\nOn 5 and 6 June these paratroopers, parachute artillery elements, and the 319th and 320th, boarded hundreds of transport planes and [[Military glider|gliders]] to begin history's largest airborne assault at the time (only [[Operation Market Garden]] later that year would be larger). During the 6{{nbsp}}June assault, a 508th platoon leader, [[First lieutenant|First Lieutenant]] [[Robert P. Mathias]], would be the first U.S. Army officer killed by German fire on D-Day.<ref>{{cite book |title=D-Day |publisher=Pocket Books |author=Ambrose, S. E. |year=2002 |page=24}}</ref> On 7{{nbsp}}June, after this first wave of attack, the 325th GIR would arrive by glider to provide a division reserve.\n\nIn Normandy, the 82nd gained its first [[Medal of Honor]] of the war, belonging to [[Private first class|Private First Class]] [[Charles N. DeGlopper]] of the 325th GIR.<ref>http://www.lonesentry.com/usdivisions/medal-of-honor/airborne/division/82nd_airborne_division.html</ref> By the time the division was relieved, in early July, the 82nd had seen 33 days of severe combat and casualties had been heavy. Losses included 5,245 troopers killed, wounded, or missing, for a total of 46% casualties.

In September, the 82nd began planning for [[Operation Market Garden]] in the [[Netherlands]]. The operation called for three-plus airborne divisions to seize and hold key bridges and roads deep behind German lines. The 504th PIR, now back at full strength, was reassigned to the 82nd, while the 507th was assigned to the [[17th Airborne Division (United States)|17th Airborne Division]], at the time training in England.\n[[File:82nd Grave.jpg|thumb|Men of the 82nd Airborne Division drop near Grave in the Netherlands during [[Operation Market Garden]]]]\n\nOn 17 September, the \"All American\" Division conducted its fourth (and final) combat jump of World War II. Fighting off German counterattacks, the division captured its objectives between [[Grave, Netherlands|Grave]], and [[Nijmegen]]. The division failed to capture Nijmegen Bridge when the opportunity presented itself early in the battle. When the British XXX Corps arrived in Nijmegen, six hours ahead of schedule, they found themselves having to fight to take a bridge that should have already been in allied hands. In the afternoon of Wednesday 20 September 1944, the 82nd Airborne Division conducted a successfully opposed river assault on the river crossing of the [[Waal (river)|Waal]] river. War correspondent [[Bill Downs]], who witnessed the assault, described it as \"a single, isolated battle that ranks in magnificence and courage with [[Battle of Guam (1941)|Guam]], [[Battle of Tarawa|Tarawa]], [[Omaha Beach]].

The [[Waffen SS]] efforts to relieve Kampfgruppe Peiper failed due to the stubborn defense of the 82nd Airborne.<ref>\"Four Stars of Valor: The Combat history of the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment in World War II\" Nordyke, P., 2006 p. 329\u2013331.</ref>\n\nOn 23 December, <!-- it --> the German divisions attacked from the south and overran the [[325th Infantry Regiment (United States)|325th GIR]] holding the Baraque- Fraiture crossroads on the 82nd's southern flank, endangering the entire 82nd Airborne division. The 2nd SS Panzer's objective was to outflank the 82nd Airborne. It was not an attack designed to reach Peiper, but it was his last chance, nonetheless. If it did outflank the 82nd, it could have opened a corridor and reached the stranded yet still powerful Kampfgruppe. But the attack came too late.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nOn 24 December 1944, the 82nd Airborne Division with an official strength of 8,520 men was facing off against a vastly superior combined force of 43,000 men and over 1,200 armored fighting and artillery vehicles and pieces.<ref>Timothy J. \"The Ardennes on Fire: The First Day of the German Assault\" 2010 pp. 56\u201358.</ref> Due to these circumstances, the 82nd Airborne Division was forced to withdrawal for the first time in its combat history.<ref>Gavin, J. \"On To Berlin: Battles of an Airborne Commander 1943\u20131946\", 1978 p. 239.</ref> The Germans pursued their retreat with the 2nd and 9th SS Panzer Divisions.

Spearheaded by the 3rd Brigade, the 82nd deployed in [[Operation Power Pack]].\n\nA year later, the 82nd went into action in [[Vietnam]]. During the [[Tet Offensive]], which swept across Vietnam in January 1968, the 3rd Brigade was en route to [[Chu Lai]] within 24 hours of receiving its orders. The 3rd Brigade performed combat duties in the [[Camp Eagle|Hu\u1ebf]] \u2013 [[Phu Bai Combat Base|Phu Bai]] area of the I Corps sector. Later the brigade moved south to [[Saigon]], and fought in the [[Mekong Delta]], the [[Iron Triangle (Vietnam)|Iron Triangle]] and along the [[Cambodia]]n border, serving nearly 22 months. While the 3rd Brigade was deployed, the division created a provisional 4th Brigade, consisting of 4th Battalion, 325th Infantry; 3d Battalion, 504th Infantry; and 3d Battalion, 505th Infantry. An additional unit, the [[3rd Battalion, 320th Field Artillery Regiment|3d Battalion, 320th Artillery]], was activated under Division Artillery to support the 4th Brigade.\n\nThe units assigned and attached to the 3d Brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division were as follows:<ref>''Vietnam Order of Battle'', by Captain (Ret.) Shelby L. Stanton, p. 83</ref>\n* Brigade Infantry:\n** 1st Battalion (Airborne), 505th Infantry\n** 2nd Battalion (Airborne), 505th Infantry\n** 1st Battalion (Airborne), 508th Infantry\n* Brigade Artillery:\n** 2nd Battalion (Airborne), 321st Artillery (105mm)\n* Brigade Aviation:\n** Company A, 82nd Aviation Battalion\n* Brigade Reconnaissance:\n** Troop B, 1st Squadron (Armored), 17th Cavalry\n** Company O (Ranger), 75th Infantry\n* Brigade Support:\n** 82nd Support Battalion\n** 58th Signal Company\n** Company C, 307th Engineer Battalion (Airborne)\n** 408th Army Security Agency Detachment\n** 52nd Chemical Detachment\n** 518th Military Intelligence Detachment\n** 307th Medical (Airborne) Headquarters and Alpha Company\n\nThe deployment of the 3rd Brigade took place with significant problems and controversy. In ''The Rise and Fall of an American Army: U.S. Ground Forces in Vietnam, 1965\u20131973,'' author Shelby L. Stanton describes how, other than the 82d, only two under-strength Marine and four skeletonized Army divisions were left stateside by the beginning of 1968. MACV, desperate for additional manpower, wanted the division to deploy to Vietnam, and the Department of the Army, wishing to retain its \"sole readily deployable strategic reserve, the last real vestige of actual Army divisional combat potency in the United States left to the Pentagon,\" compromised by sending the 3d Brigade. As Stanton wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The division had been so rushed to get this brigade to the battlefront that it ignored individual deployment criteria. Paratroopers who had just returned from Vietnam now found themselves suddenly going back. The howl of soldier complaints was so vehement that the Department of the Army was soon forced to give each trooper who had deployed to Vietnam with the 3d Brigade the option of returning to Fort Bragg or remaining with the unit. To compensate for the abrupt departures from home for those who elected to stay with the unit, the Army authorized a month leave at the soldiers' own expense or a two-week leave with government aircraft provided for special flights back to North Carolina. Of the 3,650 paratroopers who had deployed from Fort Bragg, 2,513 elected to return to the United States at once. MACV had no paratroopers to replace them, and overnight the brigade was transformed into a separate light infantry brigade, airborne in name only.</blockquote>\n\n===Urban riots in 1967\u201368===\n====1967 Detroit Riot====\nOn 24 July 1967, shortly before midnight, President [[Lyndon B.

War in the Middle East in the fall of 1973 brought the 82nd to full alert. In May 1978, the division was alerted to a possible drop into [[Zaire]]. In November 1979, the division was alerted for a possible operation to rescue the American hostages in [[Iran]]. The division formed the nucleus of the newly created [[United States Rapid Deployment Forces|Rapid Deployment Forces]] (RDF), a mobile force at a permanently high state of readiness.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n===Invasion of Grenada \u2013 Operation Urgent Fury===\n[[File:Point Salinas International Airport, Grenada.jpg|thumb|Southern Objective: Cuban-built Point Salinas Airport, [[Invasion of Grenada|Grenada]], 1983]]\n\n{{Main|United States invasion of Grenada}}\n\nOn 25 October 1983, elements of the 82d conducted an Airland Operation to secure Point Salines Airport following an airborne assault by the [[1st Ranger Battalion (United States)|1st]] and [[2nd Ranger Battalion]]s who conducted the airfield seizure just hours prior. The first 82d unit to deploy was a task force of the 2d and 3d Battalions (Airborne), 325th Infantry. On 26 October and 27, the 1st Battalion (Airborne), 505th Infantry, and the 1st and 2nd Battalions (Airborne), 508th Infantry, deployed to [[Grenada]] with support units. 2-505 deployed as well. Military operations ended in early November (Note: that C/2-325 did not deploy due to being a newly formed COHORT unit, in its place B/2-505 deployed, landing at Point Salines. The 82d expanded its missions from the airhead at Salines to weed out Cuban and Grenadian soldiers Each proceeding battalion pushed a single company forward with A/2-504 deploying only one company out of the entire brigade. The operation was flawed in several areas and identified areas needing attention to enhance the United States RDF doctrine. Newly issued Battledress Uniforms (BDUs) were not designed for the tropical environment; communication between Army ground forces and Navy and Air Force aircraft lacked interoperability and even food and other logistic support to ground forces were hampered due to communication issues between the services. The operation proved the division's ability to act as a rapid deployment force. The first aircraft carrying troopers from the 2-325th touched down at Point Salines 17 hours after H-Hour notification.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nIn March 1988, a brigade task force made up of two battalions from the 504th Infantry and 3d Battalion (Airborne), 505th Infantry, conducted a parachute insertion and air/land operation into [[Honduras]] as part of [[Operation Golden Pheasant]]. The deployment was billed as a joint training exercise, but the paratroopers were ready to fight. The deployment caused the [[Sandinista]]s to withdraw to [[Nicaragua]]. Operation Golden Pheasant prepared the paratroopers for future combat in an increasingly unstable world.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n===Panama: Operation Just Cause===\n[[File:Operation Just Cause.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Tactical map of Operation Just Cause showing major points of attack]]\n\nOn 20 December 1989, the \"All-American\", as part of the [[United States invasion of Panama]], conducted their first combat jump since World War II onto [[Tocumen International Airport|Torrijos International Airport]], Panama. The goal of the 1st Brigade task force, which was made up of the 1-504th and 2-504th INF as well as 4-325th INF and Company A, 3-505th INF, and 3-319th FAR, was to oust [[Manuel Noriega]] from power. They were joined on the ground by 3-504th INF, which was already in Panama. The invasion was initiated with a night combat jump and airfield seizures; the 82nd conducted follow-on combat air assault missions in [[Panama City]] and the surrounding areas of the Gatun Locks. The operation continued with an assault of multiple strategic installations, such as the Punta Paitilla Airport in Panama City and a Panamanian Defense Forces (PDF) garrison and airfield at Rio Hato, where Noriega also maintained a residence. The attack on La Comandancia (PDF HQ) touched off several fires, one of which destroyed most of the adjoining and heavily populated El Chorrillo neighborhood in downtown Panama City. The 82d Airborne Division secured several other key objectives such as Madden Dam, El Ranacer Prison, Gatun Locks, Gamboa and Fort Cimarron. Overall, the operation involved 27,684 U.S. troops and over 300 aircraft, including C-130 Hercules, AC-130 Spectre gunship, OA-37B Dragonfly observation, and attack aircraft, C-141 and C-5 strategic transports, F-117A Nighthawk stealth aircraft and AH-64 Apache attack helicopters. The invasion of Panama was the first combat deployment for the AH-64, the HMMWV, and the F-117A. In the short six years since the [[Operation Urgent Fury|Invasion of Grenada]], Operation Just Cause demonstrated how quickly the US Armed Forces could adapt and overcome the mistakes and equipment interoperability issues to conduct a quick and decisive victory. In all, the 82d Airborne Division suffered six of the 23 fatalities of the operation. The paratroopers began redeployment to Fort Bragg on 12 January 1990. Operation Just Cause concluded on 31 Jan 1990, just 42 days (D+42) since the invasion started.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n==Post\u2013Cold War==\n\n===Persian Gulf War===\n[[File:DesertStormMap v2.svg|thumb|250px|Ground operations during [[Operation Desert Storm]], with the 82nd Airborne Division positioned at the left flank]]\n[[File:82nd US Airborne Division 1989.png|thumb|400px|82nd US Airborne Division 1989]]\n\nSeven months later the paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne Division were again called to war.

The DRF{{nbsp}}2 and{{nbsp}}3 (1-325 and 2-325 INF, respectively) began drawing the \"line in the sand\" near al Jubail by building defenses for possible retrograde operations. Soon after, the rest of the division followed. There, intensive training began in anticipation of desert fighting against the heavily armored [[Iraqi Army]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nOn 16 January 1991, [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Storm]] began when Allied warplanes attacked Iraqi targets. As the air war began, 2d Brigade of the 82d initially deployed near an airfield in the vicinity of the [[ARAMCO]] oil facilities outside [[Abqaiq]], Saudi Arabia. While 1st Brigade and 3d Brigade consolidated at the Division HQ (CHAMPION Main) near [[Dhahran, Saudi Arabia|Dhahran]] in Coinciding with the start of the air war, three National Guard Light-Medium Truck companies, the 253d (NJARNG), 1122d (AKARNG), and the 1058th (MAARNG) joined 2d Brigade of the 82d. In the coming weeks using primarily the 5-Ton cargo trucks of these NG truck companies, the 1st Brigade moved north to \"tap line road\" in the vicinity of [[Rafha]], Saudi Arabia. Eventually, these National Guard truck units effectively \"motorized\" the 325th Infantry, providing the troop ground transportation required for them to keep pace with the French [[Division Daguet]] during the incursion. The ground war began almost six weeks later. The 2-325th INF was the division's spearhead for the ground war who actually took positions over the Iraqi border 24 hours in advance of coalition forces at 0800hrs on 22 February 1991 on Objectives Tin Man and Rochambeau. On 23 February, 82d Airborne Division paratroopers protected the [[XVIII Airborne Corps (United States)|XVIII Airborne Corps]] flank as fast-moving armor and mechanized units moved deep inside south-western Iraq. After the second day, the 1st Brigade moved forward to extend the Corps flank along with 3d Brigade. In the short 100-hour ground war, the 82d drove deep into Iraq and captured thousands of Iraqi soldiers and tons of equipment, weapons, and ammunition. During that time, the 82nd's band and MP company processed 2,721 prisoners. After the liberation of [[Kuwait]] and the surrender of the Iraqi Army, the 82nd redeployed to Fort Bragg between 18 March and 22 April after being deployed for a period of seven months.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n===Hurricane Andrew===\n\nIn August 1992, the division deployed a task force to the hurricane-ravaged area of South Florida to provide humanitarian assistance following [[Hurricane Andrew]]. For more than 30 days, troopers provided food, shelter and medical attention to the [[Florida]] population as part of the U.S. military Domestic Emergency Planning System. The 82nd was part of over 20,000 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine, Coast Guard and an additional 6200 National Guard troops deployed for the disaster.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ulbrich|first1=Jeffrey|title=82nd Airborne savors 'helping our own'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1320&dat=19920908&id=bUFWAAAAIBAJ&pg=6807,2622949&hl=en|website=news.google.com|publisher=Gainesville Sun|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThey also provided security and a sense of safety for the victims of the storm who were without power, doors, windows and in many cases roofs.

The 82d was scheduled to make combat parachute jumps into Pegasus Drop Zone and PAPIAP Drop Zone (Port-au-Prince Airport), in order to help oust the military dictatorship of [[Raoul C\u00e9dras]], and to restore the democratically elected president, [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]]. At the same time, former U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff [[Colin Powell]] were negotiating with C\u00e9dras to restore Aristide to power, the 82nd's first wave was in the air, with paratroopers waiting at Green Ramp to air-land in Ha\u00efti once the airfields there had been seized. When the Haitian military verified from sources outside [[Pope Air Force Base]] that the 82d was on the way, C\u00e9dras stepped down, averting the invasion.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nFormer Vice President [[Al Gore]] would later travel to Fort Bragg to personally thank the paratroopers of the 82nd for their actions, noting in a speech on 19 September 1994, that the 82nd's reputation was enough to change C\u00e9dras' mind:\n\n{{quote|But it did get a little close there for a while. As you may know, there were 61 planes in the air headed toward Ha\u00efti at the time they finally agreed. And at one point General Biamby came in and told General C\u00e9dras that he had just gotten word on his telephone that the airplanes had taken off from Pope Air Force Base, with soldiers from Fort Bragg, and that both disconcerted them and caused them to be suspicious of the intent of the negotiations, but it also created a situation where immediately after that, the key points they had been refusing to agree to were agreed to, a date certain, other matters that I won't go into in detail here.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}}}\n\n===Operations Safe Haven and Safe Passage===\n\nOn 12 December 1994, the 2nd Battalion (Airborne), 505th Infantry, with the 2nd Platoon of Company C, 307th Engineer Battalion, deployed as part of [[Operations Safe Haven and Safe Passage]]. The battalion deployed from Fort Bragg while on Division Ready Force{{nbsp}}1 to restore order against thousands of Cuban refugees who had attacked and injured a number of Air Force personnel and one marine while protesting their detainment at Empire Range along the [[Panama Canal]]. The battalion participated in the safeguarding of the Cuban refugees, a camp cordon and reorganization, and the active patrolling in and around the refugee camps in and around the Panamanian jungle along the Panama canal for two months. General Engineering support in the area of camp establishment/improvement operations was provided by the Sappers of the habitually associated Task Force Panther Engineer platoon, 2/C-307th. (Task Force Panther was commanded by LTC Lloyd J. Austin III, who would later be the first African American General to command U.S. Central Command.) This support included the planning of camp power requirements, pouring of 78 concrete pads, three-foot bridges, a set of \"mock doors\" for airborne pre-jump training, and a system of decks for the muddy camp. During the deployment, the paratroopers experienced a 92-degree Christmas Day and returned to Fort Bragg on 14 February 1995.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n===Operation Joint Endeavor: Bosnia===\n\nBattalions of the 82d prepared for a possible parachute jump to support elements of the [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] which had been ordered to Bosnia-Herzegovina as part of [[Operation Joint Endeavor]]. Only after engineers of the 1st Armored Division bridged the [[Sava|Sava River]] on 31 December 1995 without hostilities did the 82d begin to draw down against plans for a possible airborne operation there. The 82d's 49th [[Public affairs (military)|Public Affairs Detachment]] was deployed in support of the 1st Armored Division and air-landed in Tuzla with the 1AD TAC CP and began PA operations to include establishing the first communications in print and radio and covering the crossing of the Sava River by the main forces.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n===Centrazbat '97===\n[[File:Ceremonies marking the end of CENTRAZBAT '97.jpg|thumb|Closing ceremonies of ''CENTRAZBAT '97'' in [[Chirchik]]]]\n\nIn September 1997 the 82d traveled to [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Uzbekistan]] for CENTRAZBAT '97.

During this mobilization, Iranian generals were killed in a U.S. airstrike at the Baghdad airport. The Iranian military presence was believed to be behind the rioting at the U.S. embassy and was also believed to be planning further action against U.S. diplomats and citizens in Iraq. The actions by the Iranians and the U.S. have increased tensions in the region not seen since before the invasion of Iraq in 2003. The 82nd airborne is among the first military units to be mobilized in response to this escalation and tensions. An additional 3,500 to 4,000 troops have been ordered to deploy to Kuwait in response to Iranian threats in the region.<ref>{{Cite

On 13 September, the 163rd Infantry Brigade and 327th Infantry Regiment raided and patrolled to the northeast of [[Port-sur-Seille]], toward [[Eply]], in the [[Bois de Cheminot]], Bois de la Voivrotte, Bois de la T\u00eate-d'Or, and [[Bois Fr\u00e9haut]]. Meanwhile, the 328th Infantry Regiment, in connection with the attack of the [[90th Infantry Division (United States)|90th Division]] against the Bois-le-Pr\u00eatre, advanced on the west of the [[Moselle River]], and, in contact with the 90th Division, entered [[Norroy-l\u00e8s-Pont-\u00e0-Mousson|Norroy]], advancing to the heights just north of that town where it consolidated its position.

On 7{{nbsp}}October the division, minus the 163rd Infantry Brigade, attacked the northeastern edge of the [[Forest of Argonne|Argonne Forest]], making some progress toward [[Cornay]], and occupied Hill 180 and Hill 223. The next day it resumed the attack. Elements of the division's right flank entered Cornay but later withdrew to the east and south. The division's left flank reached the southeastern slope of the high ground northwest of [[Ch\u00e2tel-Ch\u00e9h\u00e9ry]].

It then attacked and captured [[Cornay]] and [[Enghien|Marcq]], and established the front just to their south. On 11 October, the right flank of the division occupied Sommerance and the high ground north of la Rance Rau while the left advanced to the railroad south of the Aire. The next day, the [[42nd Division (United States)|42nd]] relieved the 82nd's troops in and near Sommerance, allowing it to resume the attack. The 82nd passed through part of the [[Hindenburg line|Hindenburg]] defensive position and reached a line just north of the road from St-Georges to St-Juvin.<ref name=\"wwihist\" />\n\nOn 18 October, the division relieved elements of the [[78th Division (United States)|78th]] as far to the left as Marcq and [[Champigneulle]].

It was recalled to active service on 25 March 1942, and reorganized at [[Camp Claiborne]], [[Louisiana]], under the command of [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Omar Bradley]]. During this training period, the division brought together three officers who would ultimately steer the U.S. Army during the following two decades: [[Matthew Ridgway]], [[James M. Gavin]], and [[Maxwell D. Taylor]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Blair|first=Clay|title=Ridgeway's Paratroopers The American Airborne in World War II|year=1985|publisher=Naval Institute Press|pages=Plate 11}}</ref> Under Major General Bradley, the 82nd Division's [[Chief of staff|Chief of Staff]] was [[George Van Pope]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Doyle|first=Charles H.|title=Stand in the Door!|year=1988|publisher=Phillips Publications|location=Williamstown, New Jersey|page=104|author2=Terrell Stewart}}</ref>\n\nOn 15 August 1942, the 82nd Infantry Division, now commanded by Major General Ridgway, became the first airborne division in the history of the U.S. Army, and was redesignated as the '''82nd Airborne Division'''. The division initially consisted of the [[325th Infantry Regiment (United States)|325th]], [[326th Infantry Regiment (United States)|326th]] and [[327th Infantry Regiment (United States)|327th Infantry Regiment]]s, and supporting units. The 327th was soon transferred to help form the [[101st Airborne Division]] and was replaced by the [[504th Infantry Regiment (United States)|504th Parachute Infantry Regiment]], leaving the division with two regiments of [[glider infantry]] and one of [[Paratrooper|parachute infantry]]. In February 1943 the division received another change when the 326th was transferred to the [[13th Airborne Division (United States)|13th Airborne Division]], being replaced by the [[505th Infantry Regiment (United States)|505th Parachute Infantry Regiment]], under James M. Gavin, then a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]], who was later destined to command the division.\n\n===Sicily and Italy===\n\nIn April 1943, after several months of tough training, its troopers deployed to the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations]], under the command of Major General Ridgway to take part in the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|campaign to invade Sicily]]. The division's first two combat operations were [[Paratrooper|parachute assault]]s into Sicily on 9{{nbsp}}July and [[Allied invasion of Italy#Salerno landings|Salerno]] on 13 September 1943. The initial assault on Sicily, by the 505th Parachute Regimental Combat Team, under Colonel Gavin, was the first regimental-sized combat parachute assault conducted by the United States Army. The first glider assault did not occur until [[Normandy landings|Operation Neptune]] as part of the [[Normandy landings|D-Day landings of 6 June 1944]]. Glider troopers of the [[319th Field Artillery Regiment|319th]] and [[320th Field Artillery Regiment|320th Glider Field Artillery Battalion]]s and the 325th Glider Infantry Regiment (and the 3rd Battalion of the 504th PIR) instead arrived in Italy by [[landing craft]] at Maiori (319th) and Salerno (320th, 325th).\n\nIn January 1944, the 504th, commanded by [[Reuben Henry Tucker III|Colonel Reuben Tucker]], which was temporarily detached to [[Battle of Anzio|fight at Anzio]], adopted the nickname \"Devils in Baggy Pants\", taken from an entry in a German officer's diary. The 504th was replaced in the division by the inexperienced [[507th Parachute Infantry Regiment (United States)|507th Parachute Infantry Regiment]], under the command of Colonel [[George V. Millet, Jr.]]. While the 504th was detached, the remainder of the 82nd Airborne Division moved to the [[United Kingdom]] in November 1943 to prepare for the liberation of Europe. See [[RAF North Witham]] and [[RAF Folkingham]].\n\n===Normandy===\n\nWith two combat drops under its belt, the 82nd Airborne Division was now ready for the most ambitious airborne operation of the war so far, as part of [[Normandy landings|Operation Neptune]], the Allied [[invasion of Normandy]]. The division conducted [[Mission Boston]], part of the airborne assault phase of the [[Operation Overlord]] plan.\n\nIn preparation for the operation, the division was significantly reorganized. To ease the integration of replacement troops, rest, and refitting following the fighting in Italy, the 504th PIR did not rejoin the division for the invasion. Two new parachute infantry regiments (PIRs), the [[507th Parachute Infantry Regiment (United States)|507th]] and the [[508th Infantry Regiment (United States)|508th]], provided it, along with the veteran 505th, a three-parachute infantry regiment punch. The 325th was also reinforced by the addition of the 3rd Battalion of the [[401st Infantry Regiment (United States)|401st GIR]], bringing it up to a strength of three battalions.\n\nOn 5 and 6 June these paratroopers, parachute artillery elements, and the 319th and 320th, boarded hundreds of transport planes and [[Military glider|gliders]] to begin history's largest airborne assault at the time (only [[Operation Market Garden]] later that year would be larger). During the 6{{nbsp}}June assault, a 508th platoon leader, [[First lieutenant|First Lieutenant]] [[Robert P. Mathias]], would be the first U.S. Army officer killed by German fire on D-Day.<ref>{{cite book |title=D-Day |publisher=Pocket Books |author=Ambrose, S. E. |year=2002 |page=24}}</ref> On 7{{nbsp}}June, after this first wave of attack, the 325th GIR would arrive by glider to provide a division reserve.\n\nIn Normandy, the 82nd gained its first [[Medal of Honor]] of the war, belonging to [[Private first class|Private First Class]] [[Charles N. DeGlopper]] of the 325th GIR.<ref>http://www.lonesentry.com/usdivisions/medal-of-honor/airborne/division/82nd_airborne_division.html</ref> By the time the division was relieved, in early July, the 82nd had seen 33 days of severe combat and casualties had been heavy. Losses included 5,245 troopers killed, wounded, or missing, for a total of 46% casualties. Major General Ridgway's post-battle report stated in part, \"...&nbsp;33 days of action without relief, without replacements. Every mission accomplished. No ground gained was ever relinquished.\"<ref name=\"divhist\"/>\n\nFollowing Normandy, the 82nd Airborne Division returned to England to rest and refit for future airborne operations. The 82nd became part of the newly organized [[XVIII Airborne Corps]], which consisted of the [[17th Airborne Division (United States)|17th]], 82nd, and [[101st Airborne Division]]s. Ridgway was given command of the corps but was not promoted to [[Lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]] until 1945. His recommendation for succession as division commander was [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[James M. Gavin]], previously the 82nd's ADC. Ridgway's recommendation met with approval, and upon promotion Gavin became the youngest general since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] to command a U.S. Army division.<ref name=\"Ruggero2007\">{{cite book|last=Ruggero|first=Ed|title=The First Men In: US Paratroopers and the Fight to Save D-Day|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DQHQMGknDB0C&pg=PA307|date=29 May 2007|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=978-0-06-073129-8|page=307}}</ref>\n\n===Market Garden===\n\nOn 2 August 1944 the division became part of the [[First Allied Airborne Army]]. In September, the 82nd began planning for [[Operation Market Garden]] in the [[Netherlands]]. The operation called for three-plus airborne divisions to seize and hold key bridges and roads deep behind German lines. The 504th PIR, now back at full strength, was reassigned to the 82nd, while the 507th was assigned to the [[17th Airborne Division (United States)|17th Airborne Division]], at the time training in England.\n[[File:82nd Grave.jpg|thumb|Men of the 82nd Airborne Division drop near Grave in the Netherlands during [[Operation Market Garden]]]]\n\nOn 17 September, the \"All American\" Division conducted its fourth (and final) combat jump of World War II. Fighting off German counterattacks, the division captured its objectives between [[Grave, Netherlands|Grave]], and [[Nijmegen]]. The division failed to capture Nijmegen Bridge when the opportunity presented itself early in the battle. When the British XXX Corps arrived in Nijmegen, six hours ahead of schedule, they found themselves having to fight to take a bridge that should have already been in allied hands. In the afternoon of Wednesday 20 September 1944, the 82nd Airborne Division conducted a successfully opposed river assault on the river crossing of the [[Waal (river)|Waal]] river. War correspondent [[Bill Downs]], who witnessed the assault, described it as \"a single, isolated battle that ranks in magnificence and courage with [[Battle of Guam (1941)|Guam]], [[Battle of Tarawa|Tarawa]], [[Omaha Beach]]. A story that should be told to the blowing of bugles and the beating of drums for the men whose bravery made the capture of this crossing over the Waal possible.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Megellas|first1=James|title=All the Way to Berlin: A Paratrooper at War in Europe|date=2007|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-41448-9|page=165|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gmHcQPxrfT4C&pg=PA165}}</ref>\n\nThe Market Garden salient was held in a defensive operation for several weeks until the 82nd was relieved by Canadian troops, and sent into reserve in France. During the operation, 19-year-old [[Private (rank)|Private]] [[John R.

Spearheaded by the 3rd Brigade, the 82nd deployed in [[Operation Power Pack]].\n\nA year later, the 82nd went into action in [[Vietnam]]. During the [[Tet Offensive]], which swept across Vietnam in January 1968, the 3rd Brigade was en route to [[Chu Lai]] within 24 hours of receiving its orders. The 3rd Brigade performed combat duties in the [[Camp Eagle|Hu\u1ebf]] \u2013 [[Phu Bai Combat Base|Phu Bai]] area of the I Corps sector. Later the brigade moved south to [[Saigon]], and fought in the [[Mekong Delta]], the [[Iron Triangle (Vietnam)|Iron Triangle]] and along the [[Cambodia]]n border, serving nearly 22 months. While the 3rd Brigade was deployed, the division created a provisional 4th Brigade, consisting of 4th Battalion, 325th Infantry; 3d Battalion, 504th Infantry; and 3d Battalion, 505th Infantry. An additional unit, the [[3rd Battalion, 320th Field Artillery Regiment|3d Battalion, 320th Artillery]], was activated under Division Artillery to support the 4th Brigade.\n\nThe units assigned and attached to the 3d Brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division were as follows:<ref>''Vietnam Order of Battle'', by Captain (Ret.) Shelby L. Stanton, p. 83</ref>\n* Brigade Infantry:\n** 1st Battalion (Airborne), 505th Infantry\n** 2nd Battalion (Airborne), 505th Infantry\n** 1st Battalion (Airborne), 508th Infantry\n* Brigade Artillery:\n** 2nd Battalion (Airborne), 321st Artillery (105mm)\n* Brigade Aviation:\n** Company A, 82nd Aviation Battalion\n* Brigade Reconnaissance:\n** Troop B, 1st Squadron (Armored), 17th Cavalry\n** Company O (Ranger), 75th Infantry\n* Brigade Support:\n** 82nd Support Battalion\n** 58th Signal Company\n** Company C, 307th Engineer Battalion (Airborne)\n** 408th Army Security Agency Detachment\n** 52nd Chemical Detachment\n** 518th Military Intelligence Detachment\n** 307th Medical (Airborne) Headquarters and Alpha Company\n\nThe deployment of the 3rd Brigade took place with significant problems and controversy. In ''The Rise and Fall of an American Army: U.S. Ground Forces in Vietnam, 1965\u20131973,'' author Shelby L. Stanton describes how, other than the 82d, only two under-strength Marine and four skeletonized Army divisions were left stateside by the beginning of 1968. MACV, desperate for additional manpower, wanted the division to deploy to Vietnam, and the Department of the Army, wishing to retain its \"sole readily deployable strategic reserve, the last real vestige of actual Army divisional combat potency in the United States left to the Pentagon,\" compromised by sending the 3d Brigade. As Stanton wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The division had been so rushed to get this brigade to the battlefront that it ignored individual deployment criteria. Paratroopers who had just returned from Vietnam now found themselves suddenly going back. The howl of soldier complaints was so vehement that the Department of the Army was soon forced to give each trooper who had deployed to Vietnam with the 3d Brigade the option of returning to Fort Bragg or remaining with the unit. To compensate for the abrupt departures from home for those who elected to stay with the unit, the Army authorized a month leave at the soldiers' own expense or a two-week leave with government aircraft provided for special flights back to North Carolina. Of the 3,650 paratroopers who had deployed from Fort Bragg, 2,513 elected to return to the United States at once. MACV had no paratroopers to replace them, and overnight the brigade was transformed into a separate light infantry brigade, airborne in name only.</blockquote>\n\n===Urban riots in 1967\u201368===\n====1967 Detroit Riot====\nOn 24 July 1967, shortly before midnight, President [[Lyndon B.

The goal of the 1st Brigade task force, which was made up of the 1-504th and 2-504th INF as well as 4-325th INF and Company A, 3-505th INF, and 3-319th FAR, was to oust [[Manuel Noriega]] from power. They were joined on the ground by 3-504th INF, which was already in Panama. The invasion was initiated with a night combat jump and airfield seizures; the 82nd conducted follow-on combat air assault missions in [[Panama City]] and the surrounding areas of the Gatun Locks. The operation continued with an assault of multiple strategic installations, such as the Punta Paitilla Airport in Panama City and a Panamanian Defense Forces (PDF) garrison and airfield at Rio Hato, where Noriega also maintained a residence. The attack on La Comandancia (PDF HQ) touched off several fires, one of which destroyed most of the adjoining and heavily populated El Chorrillo neighborhood in downtown Panama City. The 82d Airborne Division secured several other key objectives such as Madden Dam, El Ranacer Prison, Gatun Locks, Gamboa and Fort Cimarron. Overall, the operation involved 27,684 U.S. troops and over 300 aircraft, including C-130 Hercules, AC-130 Spectre gunship, OA-37B Dragonfly observation, and attack aircraft, C-141 and C-5 strategic transports, F-117A Nighthawk stealth aircraft and AH-64 Apache attack helicopters. The invasion of Panama was the first combat deployment for the AH-64, the HMMWV, and the F-117A. In the short six years since the [[Operation Urgent Fury|Invasion of Grenada]], Operation Just Cause demonstrated how quickly the US Armed Forces could adapt and overcome the mistakes and equipment interoperability issues to conduct a quick and decisive victory. In all, the 82d Airborne Division suffered six of the 23 fatalities of the operation. The paratroopers began redeployment to Fort Bragg on 12 January 1990. Operation Just Cause concluded on 31 Jan 1990, just 42 days (D+42) since the invasion started.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n==Post\u2013Cold War==\n\n===Persian Gulf War===\n[[File:DesertStormMap v2.svg|thumb|250px|Ground operations during [[Operation Desert Storm]], with the 82nd Airborne Division positioned at the left flank]]\n[[File:82nd US Airborne Division 1989.png|thumb|400px|82nd US Airborne Division 1989]]\n\nSeven months later the paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne Division were again called to war.

As the air war began, 2d Brigade of the 82d initially deployed near an airfield in the vicinity of the [[ARAMCO]] oil facilities outside [[Abqaiq]], Saudi Arabia. While 1st Brigade and 3d Brigade consolidated at the Division HQ (CHAMPION Main) near [[Dhahran, Saudi Arabia|Dhahran]] in Coinciding with the start of the air war, three National Guard Light-Medium Truck companies, the 253d (NJARNG), 1122d (AKARNG), and the 1058th (MAARNG) joined 2d Brigade of the 82d. In the coming weeks using primarily the 5-Ton cargo trucks of these NG truck companies, the 1st Brigade moved north to \"tap line road\" in the vicinity of [[Rafha]], Saudi Arabia. Eventually, these National Guard truck units effectively \"motorized\" the 325th Infantry, providing the troop ground transportation required for them to keep pace with the French [[Division Daguet]] during the incursion. The ground war began almost six weeks later. The 2-325th INF was the division's spearhead for the ground war who actually took positions over the Iraqi border 24 hours in advance of coalition forces at 0800hrs on 22 February 1991 on Objectives Tin Man and Rochambeau. On 23 February, 82d Airborne Division paratroopers protected the [[XVIII Airborne Corps (United States)|XVIII Airborne Corps]] flank as fast-moving armor and mechanized units moved deep inside south-western Iraq. After the second day, the 1st Brigade moved forward to extend the Corps flank along with 3d Brigade. In the short 100-hour ground war, the 82d drove deep into Iraq and captured thousands of Iraqi soldiers and tons of equipment, weapons, and ammunition. During that time, the 82nd's band and MP company processed 2,721 prisoners. After the liberation of [[Kuwait]] and the surrender of the Iraqi Army, the 82nd redeployed to Fort Bragg between 18 March and 22 April after being deployed for a period of seven months.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n===Hurricane Andrew===\n\nIn August 1992, the division deployed a task force to the hurricane-ravaged area of South Florida to provide humanitarian assistance following [[Hurricane Andrew]].

The battalion participated in the safeguarding of the Cuban refugees, a camp cordon and reorganization, and the active patrolling in and around the refugee camps in and around the Panamanian jungle along the Panama canal for two months. General Engineering support in the area of camp establishment/improvement operations was provided by the Sappers of the habitually associated Task Force Panther Engineer platoon, 2/C-307th. (Task Force Panther was commanded by LTC Lloyd J. Austin III, who would later be the first African American General to command U.S. Central Command.) This support included the planning of camp power requirements, pouring of 78 concrete pads, three-foot bridges, a set of \"mock doors\" for airborne pre-jump training, and a system of decks for the muddy camp.

The rioters have been identified as Iranian militias operating in Iraq. On 1 January 2020, the first 750 troops began mobilizing to Kuwait. During this mobilization, Iranian generals were killed in a U.S. airstrike at the Baghdad airport. The Iranian military presence was believed to be behind the rioting at the U.S. embassy and was also believed to be planning further action against U.S. diplomats and citizens in Iraq. The actions by the Iranians and the U.S. have increased tensions in the region not seen since before the invasion of Iraq in 2003. The 82nd airborne is among the first military units to be mobilized in response to this escalation and tensions. An additional 3,500 to 4,000 troops have been ordered to deploy to Kuwait in response to Iranian threats in the region.<ref>{{Cite
