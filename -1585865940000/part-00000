An estimated 30 members and associates of [[Clan MacDonald of Glencoe]] were killed by government forces billeted with them, on the grounds they had not been prompt in pledging allegiance to the new monarchs, [[William III of England|William III of England and II of Scotland]] and [[Mary II]].\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main article|Glorious Revolution in Scotland}}\nIn March 1689, [[James_II_of_England|James II of England and VII of Scotland]] landed in Ireland in an attempt to regain his throne and [[John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee|John Graham, Viscount Dundee]], recruited a small force of [[Scottish Highlands|Highlanders]] for a supporting campaign in Scotland. Despite victory at the [[Battle of Killiecrankie]] on 27 July, Dundee was killed, and organised Jacobite military resistance ended with defeats at the [[Battle of Dunkeld]] in August 1689 and [[Battle of Cromdale|Cromdale]] in May 1690.\n\nThe continuing need to police the Highlands used resources William needed for the [[Nine Years' War]]. A peaceful Scotland was important since links between Irish and Scottish branches of the MacDonalds, as well as Scottish and [[Plantation of Ulster|Ulster]] Presbyterians, meant unrest in one country often spilled into the other.{{sfn|Lang|1912 |pp=284\u2013286}}\n\nThe Glencoe MacDonalds were one of three [[Lochaber]] clans with a reputation for lawlessness, the others being the [[MacGregors]] and the [[Clan MacDonald of Keppoch|Keppoch MacDonalds]]. Levies from these clans served in the Independent Companies used to suppress the [[Conventicle#Scotland|Conventicles]] in 1678\u201380, and took part in the devastating [[Atholl]] raid that followed [[Argyll's Rising]] in 1685.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=128}} They also combined against their Maclean landlords in the August 1688 [[Battle of Maol Ruadh]], putting them in the unusual position of being considered outlaws by both the previous Jacobite administration and the new Williamite one.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=137}}\n\n== Oath of allegiance to William ==\n[[File:1stEarlOfStair.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Lord Stair, Secretary of State for Scotland]]\nAfter [[Battle of Killiecrankie|Killiecrankie]], the Scottish government held a series of meetings with the Jacobite chiefs, offering terms that varied based on events in Ireland and Scotland. In March 1690, the Secretary of State, [[John Dalrymple, 1st Earl of Stair|Lord Stair]], offered a total of \u00a312,000 for swearing allegiance to William. They agreed to do so in the June 1691 Declaration of Achallader, [[John Campbell, 1st Earl of Breadalbane and Holland|the Earl of Breadalbane]] signing for the government; in July, the [[Battle of Aughrim]] ended [[Williamite War in Ireland|the War in Ireland]] and immediate prospects of a Restoration.\n[[File:Achallader Farm Tower - geograph.org.uk - 55403.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ruins of [[Achallader Castle]], site of the meeting that led to the Declaration of June 1691]]\nOn 26 August, a Royal Proclamation offered a pardon to anyone taking the Oath prior to 1 January 1692, with severe reprisals for those who did not.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Papers Illustrative of the Political Condition of the Highlands of Scotland, 1689\u20131706; John Gordon 2016</ref> Two days later, secret articles appeared, cancelling the agreement in the event of a Jacobite invasion and signed by all the attendees, including Breadalbane.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=139}} Breadalbane claimed these were manufactured by Glengarry, the MacDonald chief; but Stair's letters reflect his belief that forged or not, none of the signatories intended to keep their word.<ref>Correspondence of Lord Stair; Papers Illustrative of the Political Condition of the Highlands of Scotland, 1689\u20131706; John Gordon 2016</ref> Enforcement became a key concern.\n\nIn early October, the chiefs asked James for permission to take the Oath unless he could mount an invasion before the deadline, a condition they knew to be impossible.{{sfn|Szechi|1994 |p=45}} His approval was sent on 12 December and was received by Glengarry on the 23rd, but was not shared until the 28th. It is suggested delays were caused by intrigue between Catholic Jacobites, led by Glengarry, and the Protestant majority.{{sfn|Szechi|1994 |p=30}}\n\nAs a result, MacIain of Glencoe only left for Fort William on 30 December to take the Oath from the governor, Lieutenant Colonel John Hill. Since he was not authorised to accept it, Hill sent MacIain to Inverary with a letter for the local magistrate, Sir Colin Campbell confirming his arrival before the deadline. Sir Colin administered the Oath on 6 January, after which MacIain returned home.{{sfn|Buchan|1933|p=59}} Glengarry did not swear until 4 February, with others doing so by proxy, but only MacIain was excluded from the indemnity issued by the Scottish Privy Council.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=140}}\n\nStair's letter of 2 December to Breadalbane shows the intention of making an example was taken well before the deadline for the Oath but as a much bigger operation; ''...the clan Donell must be rooted out and Lochiel.

This suggests the Episcopalian Glencoe MacDonalds only replaced the Catholic Glengarry as the target on 11 January; MacIain's son John MacDonald told the 1695 Commission the soldiers came to Glencoe from the north '...Glengarry's house being reduced.'{{sfn|Cobbett|1814 |p=904}} \n\nAfter two years of negotiations, Stair was under pressure to ensure the deal stuck, while [[Archibald Campbell, 1st Duke of Argyll|Argyll]] was competing for political influence with his kinsman Breadalbane, who also found it expedient to concur with the plan.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=141}} Glengarry was pardoned and his lands returned, while maintaining his reputation at the Jacobite court by being the last to swear and ensuring Cannon and Buchan received safe conduct to France in March 1692.{{sfn|MacConechy|1843|p=77}} In summary, the Glencoe MacDonalds were a small clan with few friends and powerful enemies.\n\n== Massacre ==\nIn late January 1692, two companies or approximately 120 men from [[Earl of Argyll's Regiment of Foot|the Earl of Argyll's Regiment of Foot]] arrived in Glencoe from Invergarry. Their commander was Robert Campbell of Glenlyon, a local landowner whose niece was married to one of MacIain's sons.{{efn|As per John Prebble's account 'Glencoe; the Story of the Massacre,' this was John MacDonald, who served in the Jacobite force under Thomas Buchan scattered at Cromdale in May 1690.}} Campbell carried orders for 'free quarter', an established alternative to paying taxes in what was a largely non-cash society.{{sfn|Kennedy |2014 |p=141}} The Glencoe MacDonalds themselves were similarly billeted on the Campbells when serving with the Highland levies used to police [[Argyll]] in 1678.{{sfn|Lenman|1991|pp=238\u2013239}}\n\nHighland regiments were formed by first appointing Captains, each responsible for recruiting sixty men from his own estates. [[Muster rolls]] for the regiment from October 1691 show the vast majority came from Argyll, including [[Cowal]] and [[Kintyre]], areas settled by Lowlander migrants and badly hit by the Atholl raids of 1685 and 1686.{{sfn|Argyll Transcripts| 1891|pp=12\u201324}} \n\nOn 12 February, Hill issued orders instructing Hamilton to take 400 men and block the northern exits from Glencoe at [[Kinlochleven]]. Another 400 men from Argyll's Regiment under [[Robert Duncanson (Army officer)|Major Duncanson]] would join Glenlyon's detachment in the south and sweep northwards up the glen, killing anyone they found, removing property and burning houses.{{sfn|Somers|1843|p=538}} \n[[File:Glencoe Massacre Memorial.JPG|left|thumb|200px|Glencoe Massacre Memorial]]\nOn the evening of 12 February, Glenlyon received written orders from Duncanson carried by another Argyll officer, Captan Thomas Drummond; their tone shows doubts as to his ability or willingness to carry them out.\n''See that this be putt in execution without feud or favour, else you may expect to be dealt with as one not true to King nor Government, nor a man fitt to carry Commissione in the Kings service.'' As Captain of the Argylls' Grenadier company, Drummond was senior to Glenlyon; his presence appears to have been to ensure the orders were enforced, since witnesses gave evidence he shot two people who asked Glenlyon for mercy.{{sfn|Somers|1843|p=536}}\n\nMacIain was killed, but his two sons escaped and the 1695 Commission was given various figures for total deaths. The often quoted figure of 38 was based on hearsay evidence from Hamilton's men, while the MacDonalds claimed 'the number they knew to be slaine were about 25.'{{sfn|Cobbett|1814 |pp=902\u2013903}} Recent estimates put total deaths resulting from the Massacre as 'around 30', while claims others died of exposure have not been substantiated.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Campsie |first1=Alison |title=The Scotsman |url=https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/archaeologists-trace-lost-settlements-of-glencoe-destroyed-after-1692-massacre-1-4687371 |accessdate=3 July 2018 |work=Archaeologists trace lost settlements of Glencoe destroyed after 1692 massacre |date=12 February 2018}}</ref> \n[[File:GlencoeOrder.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Duncanson's written orders to Glenlyon{{efn|You are hereby ordered to fall upon the rebells, the McDonalds of Glenco, and put all to the sword under seventy. you are to have a speciall care that the old Fox and his sones doe upon no account escape your hands, you are to secure all the avenues that no man escape.

Duncanson was two hours late, only joining Glenlyon at the southern end at 7:00 am, after which they advanced up the glen burning houses and removing livestock. Hamilton was not in position at Kinlochleven until 11:00; his detachment included two lieutenants, Francis Farquhar and Gilbert Kennedy who often appear in anecdotes claiming they 'broke their swords rather than carry out their orders.' This differs from their testimony to the Commission and is unlikely, since they arrived hours after the killings, which were carried out at the opposite end of the glen.{{sfn|Howell|2017|p=903}}\n\nIn his letters of 30 January to Lieutenant Colonel Hamilton and Colonel Hill, Stair expresses concern the MacDonalds would escape if warned, and emphasises the need for secrecy. This correlates with evidence from James Campbell, one of Glenlyon's company, stating they had no knowledge of the plan until the morning of 13 February.{{sfn|Somers|1843|p=537}}\n\nIn May, fears of a French invasion meant the Argylls were posted to [[Brentford]] in England, then to Flanders, where they remained until the [[Nine Years' War]] ended in 1697 and the regiment was disbanded. No action was taken against those involved; Glenlyon died of disease in Bruges in August 1696, Duncanson became a Colonel and was killed fighting in Spain in May 1705, while Drummond featured in another famous Scottish disaster, the [[Darien scheme|Darien Scheme]].\n\n== Inquiry ==\nThe killings first came to public attention when a copy of Glenlyon's orders, alleged to have been left in an Edinburgh coffee house, was smuggled to France and published in the ''Paris Gazette'' of 12 April 1692.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=143}} Despite criticism of the Scottish government, there was little sympathy for the MacDonalds; the military commander in Scotland, [[Sir_Thomas_Livingstone,_Viscount_Teviot|Viscount Teviot]] wrote that 'it's not that anyone thinks the thieving tribe did not deserve to be destroyed but that it should have been done by those quartered amongst them makes a great noise.'{{sfn|Prebble|1973|p=198}} The impetus behind an inquiry was political; as a member of James' administration, Stair was unpopular with Jacobites and supporters of the new regime.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=141}}\n[[File:Moord op de gebroeders De Witt, door Pieter Frits (1627-1708).jpg|thumb|left|240px|The killing of the De Witt brothers, The Hague 1672; the Massacre first appeared as a minor issue in a broadsheet accusing William of complicity in their murder]]\nVarious observers argued Glencoe showed the Highlands could not be controlled purely by force, including Colonel Hill, who was generally sympathetic towards Highlanders and claimed even in Lochaber, {{lang|sco|a single person may travell safley where he will witout harme.}} He argued lawlessness was deliberately encouraged by leaders like Glengarry but that \u2018the midle sort of Gentrey and Commons....never got anything but hurt\u2019 from it. The 1693 Highland Judicial Commission tried to solve this by making it easier to use the law to resolve minor issues like cattle-theft. As Hill predicted, it was undermined by the clan chiefs, since it diminished control over their tenants and clansmen.{{sfn|Kennedy|2017|pp=32\u201360}}\n\nIn 1695, the massacre was referenced in a pamphlet written by [[Charles Leslie (nonjuror)|Charles Leslie]], a [[Nonjuring schism|nonjuring]] [[Church of Ireland]] Episcopalian priest who moved to London in 1690 and produced pro-Jacobite articles until his death in 1721.<ref>[https://macsphere.mcmaster.ca/bitstream/11375/15541/1/frank%20william.pdf Charles Leslie & Theological Politics in Post Revolutionary England]; William Frank, B.A., Thesis for the Degree Doctor of Philosophy McMaster University February 1983</ref> This focused on was William's alleged complicity in the 1672 death of Dutch Republican leader [[Johan de Witt]], with the additions of Glencoe and a number of other crimes.<ref>[https://digital.nls.uk/scotlandspages/timeline/1692.html Gallienus Redivivus, or Murther will out, &c. Being a true Account of the De Witting of Glencoe], Gaffney,\u2019 Edinburgh, 1695</ref>\n\nA Parliamentary Commission was set up to determine whether there was a case to answer under the charge of 'Slaughter under trust.' This 1587 law was intended to reduce endemic feuding by requiring opponents to use the Crown to settle disputes and applied to murder committed in 'cold-blood', i.e., once articles of surrender had been agreed or hospitality accepted.{{sfn|Harris |2015 |pp=53\u201354}} This was subject to interpretation; in 1597, James MacDonald was charged under the law for assembling 200 men outside his parents' house, locking them inside and setting fire to it but this was later judged 'hot-blooded' and excluded.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=128}} \n\nAs both a capital offence and treason, it was an awkward weapon with which to attack Stair, as William himself signed the orders and the intent was widely known in government circles. The Commission therefore focused on whether participants exceeded their orders, not their legality; it concluded Stair and Hamilton had a case to answer but left the decision to William. {{sfn|Somers|1843|p=545}} While Stair was dismissed as Secretary of State, he returned to government in 1700 and was made an earl by the last Stuart monarch, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].{{sfn|Hopkins|1998 |p=395}} An application by the surviving Glencoe MacDonalds for compensation was ignored; they rebuilt their houses and participated in both the 1715 and 1745 Jacobite risings.{{sfn|Prebble|1973|p=214}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\n[[File:McCulloch, Glencoe, Argyllshire.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Glencoe by Horatio McCulloch, 1864; a remote and empty landscape]]\nDespite its reputation, Glencoe was not particularly unusual; other examples involving the MacDonalds include the 1578 [[Battle of the Spoiling Dyke]] and the [[Battle_of_Dunaverty|Dunaverty]] Massacre in 1647. Breach of hospitality was less common, but far from unique; the charge of 'Slaughter under trust' was first used in 1588 to prosecute Lachlan Maclean, whose objections to his new stepfather, John MacDonald, resulted in the murder of 18 members of the MacDonald wedding party.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=129}} \n\nIts continuing significance derives from being used as a symbol of post-1688 oppression; in 1745, [[Charles Edward Stuart|Prince Charles]] ordered Leslie's pamphlet and the 1695 Parliamentary minutes to be reprinted in the Edinburgh ''Caledonian Mercury''.{{sfn|Hopkins|1998 |p=1}} In 1859, it re-appeared{{cn|date=March 2020}} in [[Thomas Babington Macaulay|Macaulay]]'s ''[[The History of England from the Accession of James the Second|History]]''; he sought to exonerate William from every charge made by Leslie,{{primary-inline|date=March 2020}} including the Massacre, and this is the first recorded instance{{cn|date=March 2020}} of the claim it was part of a [[Clan Campbell|Campbell]]\u2013MacDonald clan feud.{{sfn|Macaulay|1859|p=277}}\n[[File:Peter Graham - After the Massacre of Glencoe - Google Art Project.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''After the Massacre of Glencoe'' by Peter Graham, 1889; the survivors seek refuge.]]\n[[Victorian_era|Victorian]] Scotland developed values that were pro-Union and pro-Empire, while also being uniquely Scottish.{{sfn|Morris|1992|pp=37\u201339}} Historical divisions meant this was largely expressed through a shared cultural identity, while the study of Scottish history itself virtually disappeared from universities.{{sfn|Kidd|1997|p=100}} Glencoe became part of a focus on 'the emotional trappings of the Scottish past...bonnie Scotland of the bens and glens and misty shieling, the Jacobites, Mary, Queen of Scots, tartan mania and the raising of historical statuary.'{{sfn |Ash|1980|p=10}} \n\nEven when Scottish history re-emerged in the 1950s, Leslie's perspectives continued to shape views of William's reign as particularly disastrous for Scotland.

An estimated 30 members and associates of [[Clan MacDonald of Glencoe]] were killed by government forces billeted with them, on the grounds they had not been prompt in pledging allegiance to the new monarchs, [[William III of England|William III of England and II of Scotland]] and [[Mary II]].\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main article|Glorious Revolution in Scotland}}\nIn March 1689, [[James_II_of_England|James II of England and VII of Scotland]] landed in Ireland in an attempt to regain his throne and [[John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee|John Graham, Viscount Dundee]], recruited a small force of [[Scottish Highlands|Highlanders]] for a supporting campaign in Scotland. Despite victory at the [[Battle of Killiecrankie]] on 27 July, Dundee was killed, and organised Jacobite military resistance ended with defeats at the [[Battle of Dunkeld]] in August 1689 and [[Battle of Cromdale|Cromdale]] in May 1690.\n\nThe continuing need to police the Highlands used resources William needed for the [[Nine Years' War]]. A peaceful Scotland was important since links between Irish and Scottish branches of the MacDonalds, as well as Scottish and [[Plantation of Ulster|Ulster]] Presbyterians, meant unrest in one country often spilled into the other.{{sfn|Lang|1912 |pp=284\u2013286}}\n\nThe Glencoe MacDonalds were one of three [[Lochaber]] clans with a reputation for lawlessness, the others being the [[MacGregors]] and the [[Clan MacDonald of Keppoch|Keppoch MacDonalds]]. Levies from these clans served in the Independent Companies used to suppress the [[Conventicle#Scotland|Conventicles]] in 1678\u201380, and took part in the devastating [[Atholl]] raid that followed [[Argyll's Rising]] in 1685.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=128}} They also combined against their Maclean landlords in the August 1688 [[Battle of Maol Ruadh]], putting them in the unusual position of being considered outlaws by both the previous Jacobite administration and the new Williamite one.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=137}}\n\n== Oath of allegiance to William ==\n[[File:1stEarlOfStair.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Lord Stair, Secretary of State for Scotland]]\nAfter [[Battle of Killiecrankie|Killiecrankie]], the Scottish government held a series of meetings with the Jacobite chiefs, offering terms that varied based on events in Ireland and Scotland. In March 1690, the Secretary of State, [[John Dalrymple, 1st Earl of Stair|Lord Stair]], offered a total of \u00a312,000 for swearing allegiance to William. They agreed to do so in the June 1691 Declaration of Achallader, [[John Campbell, 1st Earl of Breadalbane and Holland|the Earl of Breadalbane]] signing for the government; in July, the [[Battle of Aughrim]] ended [[Williamite War in Ireland|the War in Ireland]] and immediate prospects of a Restoration.\n[[File:Achallader Farm Tower - geograph.org.uk - 55403.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ruins of [[Achallader Castle]], site of the meeting that led to the Declaration of June 1691]]\nOn 26 August, a Royal Proclamation offered a pardon to anyone taking the Oath prior to 1 January 1692, with severe reprisals for those who did not.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Papers Illustrative of the Political Condition of the Highlands of Scotland, 1689\u20131706; John Gordon 2016</ref> Two days later, secret articles appeared, cancelling the agreement in the event of a Jacobite invasion and signed by all the attendees, including Breadalbane.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=139}} Breadalbane claimed these were manufactured by Glengarry, the MacDonald chief; but Stair's letters reflect his belief that forged or not, none of the signatories intended to keep their word.<ref>Correspondence of Lord Stair; Papers Illustrative of the Political Condition of the Highlands of Scotland, 1689\u20131706; John Gordon 2016</ref> Enforcement became a key concern.\n\nIn early October, the chiefs asked James for permission to take the Oath unless he could mount an invasion before the deadline, a condition they knew to be impossible.{{sfn|Szechi|1994 |p=45}} His approval was sent on 12 December and was received by Glengarry on the 23rd, but was not shared until the 28th. It is suggested delays were caused by intrigue between Catholic Jacobites, led by Glengarry, and the Protestant majority.{{sfn|Szechi|1994 |p=30}}\n\nAs a result, MacIain of Glencoe only left for Fort William on 30 December to take the Oath from the governor, Lieutenant Colonel John Hill. Since he was not authorised to accept it, Hill sent MacIain to Inverary with a letter for the local magistrate, Sir Colin Campbell confirming his arrival before the deadline. Sir Colin administered the Oath on 6 January, after which MacIain returned home.{{sfn|Buchan|1933|p=59}} Glengarry did not swear until 4 February, with others doing so by proxy, but only MacIain was excluded from the indemnity issued by the Scottish Privy Council.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=140}}\n\nStair's letter of 2 December to Breadalbane shows the intention of making an example was taken well before the deadline for the Oath but as a much bigger operation; ''...the clan Donell must be rooted out and Lochiel. Leave the McLeans to Argyll...''{{sfn|Goring|2014|pp=94\u201396}} In January, he wrote three letters in quick succession to [[Sir_Thomas_Livingstone,_Viscount_Teviot|Sir Thomas Livingstone]], military commander in Scotland; on 7th, the intention was to ''....destroy entirely the country of Lochaber, Locheal's lands, Kippochs, Glengarrie and Glenco...;'' on 9th ''...their chieftains all being '''papists''', it is well the vengeance falls there; for my part, I regret the MacDonalds had not divided and...'''Kippoch and Glenco are safe'''.'' The last on 11 January states; ''...my lord Argile tells me Glenco hath not taken the oaths at which I rejoice....''{{sfn|Goring|2014|pp=97\u2013100}}\n[[File:Invergarry Old Castle - geograph.org.uk - 1515750.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Glengarry's house; Invergarry Castle in 2009]]\nParliament passed a Decree of Forfeiture in 1690, depriving Glengarry of his lands, but he continued to hold [[Invergarry Castle]], whose garrison included the senior Jacobite officers [[Alexander Cannon]] and [[Thomas Buchan]]. This suggests the Episcopalian Glencoe MacDonalds only replaced the Catholic Glengarry as the target on 11 January; MacIain's son John MacDonald told the 1695 Commission the soldiers came to Glencoe from the north '...Glengarry's house being reduced.'{{sfn|Cobbett|1814 |p=904}} \n\nAfter two years of negotiations, Stair was under pressure to ensure the deal stuck, while [[Archibald Campbell, 1st Duke of Argyll|Argyll]] was competing for political influence with his kinsman Breadalbane, who also found it expedient to concur with the plan.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=141}} Glengarry was pardoned and his lands returned, while maintaining his reputation at the Jacobite court by being the last to swear and ensuring Cannon and Buchan received safe conduct to France in March 1692.{{sfn|MacConechy|1843|p=77}} In summary, the Glencoe MacDonalds were a small clan with few friends and powerful enemies.\n\n== Massacre ==\nIn late January 1692, two companies or approximately 120 men from [[Earl of Argyll's Regiment of Foot|the Earl of Argyll's Regiment of Foot]] arrived in Glencoe from Invergarry. Their commander was Robert Campbell of Glenlyon, a local landowner whose niece was married to one of MacIain's sons.{{efn|As per John Prebble's account 'Glencoe; the Story of the Massacre,' this was John MacDonald, who served in the Jacobite force under Thomas Buchan scattered at Cromdale in May 1690.}} Campbell carried orders for 'free quarter', an established alternative to paying taxes in what was a largely non-cash society.{{sfn|Kennedy |2014 |p=141}} The Glencoe MacDonalds themselves were similarly billeted on the Campbells when serving with the Highland levies used to police [[Argyll]] in 1678.{{sfn|Lenman|1991|pp=238\u2013239}}\n\nHighland regiments were formed by first appointing Captains, each responsible for recruiting sixty men from his own estates. [[Muster rolls]] for the regiment from October 1691 show the vast majority came from Argyll, including [[Cowal]] and [[Kintyre]], areas settled by Lowlander migrants and badly hit by the Atholl raids of 1685 and 1686.{{sfn|Argyll Transcripts| 1891|pp=12\u201324}} \n\nOn 12 February, Hill issued orders instructing Hamilton to take 400 men and block the northern exits from Glencoe at [[Kinlochleven]]. Another 400 men from Argyll's Regiment under [[Robert Duncanson (Army officer)|Major Duncanson]] would join Glenlyon's detachment in the south and sweep northwards up the glen, killing anyone they found, removing property and burning houses.{{sfn|Somers|1843|p=538}} \n[[File:Glencoe Massacre Memorial.JPG|left|thumb|200px|Glencoe Massacre Memorial]]\nOn the evening of 12 February, Glenlyon received written orders from Duncanson carried by another Argyll officer, Captan Thomas Drummond; their tone shows doubts as to his ability or willingness to carry them out.\n''See that this be putt in execution without feud or favour, else you may expect to be dealt with as one not true to King nor Government, nor a man fitt to carry Commissione in the Kings service.'' As Captain of the Argylls' Grenadier company, Drummond was senior to Glenlyon; his presence appears to have been to ensure the orders were enforced, since witnesses gave evidence he shot two people who asked Glenlyon for mercy.{{sfn|Somers|1843|p=536}}\n\nMacIain was killed, but his two sons escaped and the 1695 Commission was given various figures for total deaths. The often quoted figure of 38 was based on hearsay evidence from Hamilton's men, while the MacDonalds claimed 'the number they knew to be slaine were about 25.'{{sfn|Cobbett|1814 |pp=902\u2013903}} Recent estimates put total deaths resulting from the Massacre as 'around 30', while claims others died of exposure have not been substantiated.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Campsie |first1=Alison |title=The Scotsman |url=https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/archaeologists-trace-lost-settlements-of-glencoe-destroyed-after-1692-massacre-1-4687371 |accessdate=3 July 2018 |work=Archaeologists trace lost settlements of Glencoe destroyed after 1692 massacre |date=12 February 2018}}</ref> \n[[File:GlencoeOrder.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Duncanson's written orders to Glenlyon{{efn|You are hereby ordered to fall upon the rebells, the McDonalds of Glenco, and put all to the sword under seventy. you are to have a speciall care that the old Fox and his sones doe upon no account escape your hands, you are to secure all the avenues that no man escape.

Duncanson was two hours late, only joining Glenlyon at the southern end at 7:00 am, after which they advanced up the glen burning houses and removing livestock. Hamilton was not in position at Kinlochleven until 11:00; his detachment included two lieutenants, Francis Farquhar and Gilbert Kennedy who often appear in anecdotes claiming they 'broke their swords rather than carry out their orders.' This differs from their testimony to the Commission and is unlikely, since they arrived hours after the killings, which were carried out at the opposite end of the glen.{{sfn|Howell|2017|p=903}}\n\nIn his letters of 30 January to Lieutenant Colonel Hamilton and Colonel Hill, Stair expresses concern the MacDonalds would escape if warned, and emphasises the need for secrecy. This correlates with evidence from James Campbell, one of Glenlyon's company, stating they had no knowledge of the plan until the morning of 13 February.{{sfn|Somers|1843|p=537}}\n\nIn May, fears of a French invasion meant the Argylls were posted to [[Brentford]] in England, then to Flanders, where they remained until the [[Nine Years' War]] ended in 1697 and the regiment was disbanded. No action was taken against those involved; Glenlyon died of disease in Bruges in August 1696, Duncanson became a Colonel and was killed fighting in Spain in May 1705, while Drummond featured in another famous Scottish disaster, the [[Darien scheme|Darien Scheme]].\n\n== Inquiry ==\nThe killings first came to public attention when a copy of Glenlyon's orders, alleged to have been left in an Edinburgh coffee house, was smuggled to France and published in the ''Paris Gazette'' of 12 April 1692.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=143}} Despite criticism of the Scottish government, there was little sympathy for the MacDonalds; the military commander in Scotland, [[Sir_Thomas_Livingstone,_Viscount_Teviot|Viscount Teviot]] wrote that 'it's not that anyone thinks the thieving tribe did not deserve to be destroyed but that it should have been done by those quartered amongst them makes a great noise.'{{sfn|Prebble|1973|p=198}} The impetus behind an inquiry was political; as a member of James' administration, Stair was unpopular with Jacobites and supporters of the new regime.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=141}}\n[[File:Moord op de gebroeders De Witt, door Pieter Frits (1627-1708).jpg|thumb|left|240px|The killing of the De Witt brothers, The Hague 1672; the Massacre first appeared as a minor issue in a broadsheet accusing William of complicity in their murder]]\nVarious observers argued Glencoe showed the Highlands could not be controlled purely by force, including Colonel Hill, who was generally sympathetic towards Highlanders and claimed even in Lochaber, {{lang|sco|a single person may travell safley where he will witout harme.}} He argued lawlessness was deliberately encouraged by leaders like Glengarry but that \u2018the midle sort of Gentrey and Commons....never got anything but hurt\u2019 from it. The 1693 Highland Judicial Commission tried to solve this by making it easier to use the law to resolve minor issues like cattle-theft. As Hill predicted, it was undermined by the clan chiefs, since it diminished control over their tenants and clansmen.{{sfn|Kennedy|2017|pp=32\u201360}}\n\nIn 1695, the massacre was referenced in a pamphlet written by [[Charles Leslie (nonjuror)|Charles Leslie]], a [[Nonjuring schism|nonjuring]] [[Church of Ireland]] Episcopalian priest who moved to London in 1690 and produced pro-Jacobite articles until his death in 1721.<ref>[https://macsphere.mcmaster.ca/bitstream/11375/15541/1/frank%20william.pdf Charles Leslie & Theological Politics in Post Revolutionary England]; William Frank, B.A., Thesis for the Degree Doctor of Philosophy McMaster University February 1983</ref> This focused on was William's alleged complicity in the 1672 death of Dutch Republican leader [[Johan de Witt]], with the additions of Glencoe and a number of other crimes.<ref>[https://digital.nls.uk/scotlandspages/timeline/1692.html Gallienus Redivivus, or Murther will out, &c. Being a true Account of the De Witting of Glencoe], Gaffney,\u2019 Edinburgh, 1695</ref>\n\nA Parliamentary Commission was set up to determine whether there was a case to answer under the charge of 'Slaughter under trust.' This 1587 law was intended to reduce endemic feuding by requiring opponents to use the Crown to settle disputes and applied to murder committed in 'cold-blood', i.e., once articles of surrender had been agreed or hospitality accepted.{{sfn|Harris |2015 |pp=53\u201354}} This was subject to interpretation; in 1597, James MacDonald was charged under the law for assembling 200 men outside his parents' house, locking them inside and setting fire to it but this was later judged 'hot-blooded' and excluded.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=128}} \n\nAs both a capital offence and treason, it was an awkward weapon with which to attack Stair, as William himself signed the orders and the intent was widely known in government circles. The Commission therefore focused on whether participants exceeded their orders, not their legality; it concluded Stair and Hamilton had a case to answer but left the decision to William. {{sfn|Somers|1843|p=545}} While Stair was dismissed as Secretary of State, he returned to government in 1700 and was made an earl by the last Stuart monarch, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].{{sfn|Hopkins|1998 |p=395}} An application by the surviving Glencoe MacDonalds for compensation was ignored; they rebuilt their houses and participated in both the 1715 and 1745 Jacobite risings.{{sfn|Prebble|1973|p=214}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\n[[File:McCulloch, Glencoe, Argyllshire.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Glencoe by Horatio McCulloch, 1864; a remote and empty landscape]]\nDespite its reputation, Glencoe was not particularly unusual; other examples involving the MacDonalds include the 1578 [[Battle of the Spoiling Dyke]] and the [[Battle_of_Dunaverty|Dunaverty]] Massacre in 1647. Breach of hospitality was less common, but far from unique; the charge of 'Slaughter under trust' was first used in 1588 to prosecute Lachlan Maclean, whose objections to his new stepfather, John MacDonald, resulted in the murder of 18 members of the MacDonald wedding party.{{sfn|Levine|1999|p=129}} \n\nIts continuing significance derives from being used as a symbol of post-1688 oppression; in 1745, [[Charles Edward Stuart|Prince Charles]] ordered Leslie's pamphlet and the 1695 Parliamentary minutes to be reprinted in the Edinburgh ''Caledonian Mercury''.{{sfn|Hopkins|1998 |p=1}} In 1859, it re-appeared{{cn|date=March 2020}} in [[Thomas Babington Macaulay|Macaulay]]'s ''[[The History of England from the Accession of James the Second|History]]''; he sought to exonerate William from every charge made by Leslie,{{primary-inline|date=March 2020}} including the Massacre, and this is the first recorded instance{{cn|date=March 2020}} of the claim it was part of a [[Clan Campbell|Campbell]]\u2013MacDonald clan feud.{{sfn|Macaulay|1859|p=277}}\n[[File:Peter Graham - After the Massacre of Glencoe - Google Art Project.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''After the Massacre of Glencoe'' by Peter Graham, 1889; the survivors seek refuge.]]\n[[Victorian_era|Victorian]] Scotland developed values that were pro-Union and pro-Empire, while also being uniquely Scottish.{{sfn|Morris|1992|pp=37\u201339}} Historical divisions meant this was largely expressed through a shared cultural identity, while the study of Scottish history itself virtually disappeared from universities.{{sfn|Kidd|1997|p=100}} Glencoe became part of a focus on 'the emotional trappings of the Scottish past...bonnie Scotland of the bens and glens and misty shieling, the Jacobites, Mary, Queen of Scots, tartan mania and the raising of historical statuary.'{{sfn |Ash|1980|p=10}} \n\nEven when Scottish history re-emerged in the 1950s, Leslie's perspectives continued to shape views of William's reign as particularly disastrous for Scotland. This meant Glencoe became part of a series of incidents, including the [[Darien scheme]], the famine of the late 1690s, and ultimately Union in 1707.{{sfn|Kennedy|2017|pp=32\u201333}} \n\nThe Massacre is the centre of an annual ceremony initiated in 1930 by Mary Rankin from Taigh a\u2019 phuirt, Glencoe, and continued by her family.<ref>''[[The Oban Times]]'', 22 February 1958.</ref> On 13 February each year the Clan Donald Society holds a wreath-laying ceremony attended by members from around the world at the Upper Carnoch memorial; this is a tapering Celtic cross designed in 1883 by MacDonald of Aberdeen and located at the eastern end of Glencoe village, formerly known as Carnoch.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/71831/ |title=Site Record for Glencoe, Massacre Of Glencoe Memorial; Macdonald's Monument; Glencoe Massacre |publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland |accessdate=4 November 2013}}.

Hayes attended [[Dominican Academy]]'s prestigious primary school, on Manhattan's Upper East Side, from 1910 to 1912, appearing there in ''The Old Dutch'', ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'', and other performances. She attended the [[Shrine of the Sacred Heart#Sacred Heart School|Academy of the Sacred Heart Convent]] in Washington and graduated in 1917.<ref>[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/helen-hayes \"Helen Hayes\"] biography.yourdictionary.com, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Helen Hayes 1927.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hayes in 1927]]\nHer sound film debut was ''[[The Sin of Madelon Claudet]]'', for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She followed that with starring roles in ''[[Arrowsmith (film)|Arrowsmith]]'' (with [[Ronald Colman]]), ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1932 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (with [[Gary Cooper]]), ''[[The White Sister (1933 film)|The White Sister]]'' (opposite [[Clark Gable]]), ''[[Another Language]]'' (opposite [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]]), ''[[What Every Woman Knows (1934 film)|What Every Woman Knows]]'' (a reprise of her Broadway hit), and ''[[Vanessa: Her Love Story]]'' also with Robert Montgomery. But Hayes did not prefer film to the stage.\n\nHayes eventually returned to Broadway in 1935, where for three years she played the title role in [[Gilbert Miller]]'s production of ''[[Victoria Regina (play)|Victoria Regina]]'', with [[Vincent Price]] as Prince Albert, first at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] and later at the [[Martin Beck Theatre]].\n\n[[File:What Every Woman Knows 1934.JPG|thumb|Hayes in the film ''What Every Woman Knows'' (1934)]]\nIn 1951, she was involved in the Broadway revival of [[J.M. Barrie]]'s play ''[[Mary Rose (play)|Mary Rose]]'' at the [[August Wilson Theatre|ANTA Playhouse]]. In 1953, she was the first-ever recipient of the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her work in [[Chicago theatre]], repeating as the winner in 1969. She returned to Hollywood in the 1950s, and her film star began to rise. She starred in ''[[My Son John]]'' (1952) and ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), and won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as an elderly stowaway in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970). She followed that up with several roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films such as ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'', ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing]]'' and ''[[Candleshoe]]''. Her performance in ''Anastasia'' was considered a comeback\u2014she had suspended her career for several years due to her daughter Mary's death and her husband's failing health.\n\nIn 1955, the [[Fulton Theatre/Helen Hayes Theatre|Fulton Theatre]] was renamed for her. In the 1980s, business interests wished to raze that theatre and four others to construct a large hotel that included the [[Marquis Theatre]]. Hayes's consent to raze the theatre named for her was sought and given, though she had no ownership interest in the building. Parts of the original Helen Hayes Theatre on Broadway were used to construct [[the Shakespeare Center]] on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which Hayes dedicated with [[Joseph Papp]] in 1982.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', September 13, 1982</ref> In 1983 the Little Theater on West 45th Street was renamed the [[Helen Hayes Theatre]] in her honor, as was a theatre in Nyack, which has since been renamed the Riverspace-Arts Center. In early 2014, the site was refurbished and styled by interior designer Dawn Hershko and reopened as the Playhouse Market, a quaint restaurant and gourmet deli.\n\nHayes, who spoke with her good friend [[Anita Loos]] almost daily on the phone, told her, \"I used to think New York was the most enthralling place in the world. I'll bet it still is and if I were free next summer, I would prove it.\" With that, she convinced Loos to embark on an exploration of all five boroughs of New York. They visited and explored the city; Bellevue Hospital at night, a tugboat hauling garbage out to sea, parties, libraries, and Puerto Rican markets. They spoke to everyday people to see how they lived their lives and what made the city tick. The result of this collaborative effort was the book ''Twice Over Lightly'', published in 1972.\n\nIt is unclear when or by whom Hayes was called the \"First Lady of the Theatre\". Her friend, actress [[Katharine Cornell]], also held that title, and each thought the other deserved it.<ref name=autogenerated1>Mosel, p.unknown</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771605,00.html \"The Theatre: Great Katharine\"].

Some of these books' themes include her return to Roman Catholicism (she had been denied communion from the Church for the duration of her marriage to [[Charles MacArthur]], who was a [[divorce]]d Protestant); and the death of her only daughter, Mary (1930\u20131949), an aspiring actress, of [[polio]] at the age of 19. Hayes's adopted son, [[James MacArthur]] (1937\u20132010), went on to a career in acting, starring in ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' on television. Hayes guest-starred on ''Hawaii Five-O'' in the 1975 episode \"Retire in Sunny Hawaii... Forever\" and later, in 1980, both appeared in ''[[The Love Boat]]'' episode \"No Girls for Doc/Marriage of Convenience/The Caller/The Witness\".\n\nHayes was hospitalized a number of times for [[asthma]], which was aggravated by stage dust, forcing her to retire from theater in 1971, at age 71.<ref>Anderson, Ruth Nathan. \"Helen Hayes Discovers She's Allergic to Dust,\" ''Boca Raton News'', November 23, 1980</ref><ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nHer last Broadway show was a 1970 revival of ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'', in which she co-starred with [[James Stewart]]. [[Clive Barnes]] wrote, \"She epitomizes flustered charm almost as if it were a style of acting ... She is one of those actors ... where to watch how she is doing something is almost as pleasurable as what she is doing.\"<ref>Barnes, Clive. \"Stage:Unseen White Rabbit Returns:James Stewart Stars in Phoenix's 'Harvey'\", ''The New York Times'', February 25, 1970, p.41</ref> She spent most of her last years writing and raising money for organizations that fight asthma.\n\n==Philanthropy==\n[[File:SHAKESPEARE CENTER DEDICATION HELEN HAYES 4 small.jpg|thumb|upright|Riverside Shakespeare Company Shakespeare Center Dedication with Helen Hayes, 1982.]]\nHayes was a generous donor of time and money to a number of causes and organizations, including the [[Riverside Shakespeare Company]] of New York City. Along with [[Mildred Natwick]], she became a founding member of the company's Board of Advisors in 1981.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', Sept 13, 1982</ref> She was also on the board of directors for the Greater New York Council of the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] during the early 1970s.\n\nIn 1982, Hayes dedicated Riverside's [[The Shakespeare Center]] with New York theatre producer, [[Joseph Papp]],<ref>Brochure of the Riverside Shakespeare Company, 1982, p. 3.</ref> and in 1985 she returned to the New York stage in a benefit for the company with a reading of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' with [[Raul Julia]], [[Len Cariou]], [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]], [[Carole Shelley]], [[Celeste Holm]] and [[Harold Russell Scott, Jr.|Harold Scott]], directed by W. Stuart McDowell.<ref>Tomasson, Robert E. \"Helping Those Who Help;Scrooge's Return\", ''The New York Times'', November 24, 1985, p.78</ref> The next year Hayes performed a second benefit for the Riverside Shakespeare Company, this time at the [[Marquis Theatre]], the construction of which had been made possible by the demolition of the Helen Hayes Theatre three years before. The production featured [[Rex Smith]], [[Ossie Davis]] and [[F. Murray Abraham]], and was produced by McDowell and directed by Robert Small, with Hayes narrating.\n\n==Helen Hayes Hospital==\n[[File:Helen Hayes and young patient at Helen Hayes Hospital 1945.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Helen Hayes and a young patient at Helen Hayes Hospital 1945]]\n\nAccording to her daughter-in-law, HB MacArthur, Hayes took the most pride in her philanthropic work with [[Helen Hayes Hospital]], a physical rehabilitation hospital located in [[West Haverstraw]], New York. She was extremely proud of the strides the hospital made toward the rehabilitation of people with disabilities, saying: \"I've seen my name in lights on theater marquees and in letters 20 feet tall on Broadway billboards, but nothing has ever given me greater sense of pride and satisfaction than my 49-year association with this unique hospital.\"<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|title=Pretty Penny to host Helen Hayes Hospital fundraiser - Lohud Rockland Blog|access-date=2017-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322020040/http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|archive-date=2017-03-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Helen Hayes MacArthur on the grounds of Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.jpg|right|thumb|Helen Hayes at Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.]]\nHayes became involved with the hospital in the 1940s, and was named to the Board of Visitors in 1944. In 1974, the hospital was renamed in her honor. She served on the Helen Hayes Hospital Board of Visitors for 49 years, until her death in 1993. In that time, she advocated tirelessly for the hospital, and successfully led a fight to prevent its relocation to Albany in the 1960s. In the 1970s, she was instrumental in lobbying for funding to transform the hospital into a state-of-the-art facility.\n\nHayes also contributed her enthusiastic support to hospital events and fund-raising efforts, including handing out diplomas to the children upon graduation when the hospital was still a pediatric care facility. She also faithfully attended the hospital's annual Classic Race, leading it in a classic car, handing out awards to runners, hand cyclists, and wheelchair racers, and offering the use of her home, Pretty Penny, for a dinner to launch the hospital's endowment fund.<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\"/>\n\n==Death==\nHayes died on March 17, 1993, of [[congestive heart failure]] in [[Nyack, New York]]. Hayes's friend [[Lillian Gish]], the \"First Lady of American Cinema\", was the designated beneficiary of her estate, but Gish had died less than a month earlier. Hayes was interred in Oak Hill Cemetery in Nyack.<ref name=pace>Pace, Eric.[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFDF123DF93BA25750C0A965958260 \"Helen Hayes, Flower of the Stage, Dies at 92\"]''The New York Times'' (requires registration), March 18, 1993</ref> In 2011, she was honored with a US postage stamp.<ref>[http://www.beyondtheperf.com/stamp-releases/helen-hayes \"Helen Hayes Postage Stamp\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611152808/https://beyondtheperf.com/stamp-releases/helen-hayes |date=2011-06-11 }} beyondtheperf.com, April 25, 2011, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nDiminutive and homespun, Helen Hayes was distinctly less glamorous than the other Great Ladies, but the qualities of modesty and practicality that she projected helped create her lasting appeal.

In 1955, the former Fulton Theatre on 46th Street in New York City's Broadway [[Theater District]] was renamed the Helen Hayes Theatre.

Hayes attended [[Dominican Academy]]'s prestigious primary school, on Manhattan's Upper East Side, from 1910 to 1912, appearing there in ''The Old Dutch'', ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'', and other performances. She attended the [[Shrine of the Sacred Heart#Sacred Heart School|Academy of the Sacred Heart Convent]] in Washington and graduated in 1917.<ref>[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/helen-hayes \"Helen Hayes\"] biography.yourdictionary.com, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Helen Hayes 1927.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hayes in 1927]]\nHer sound film debut was ''[[The Sin of Madelon Claudet]]'', for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She followed that with starring roles in ''[[Arrowsmith (film)|Arrowsmith]]'' (with [[Ronald Colman]]), ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1932 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (with [[Gary Cooper]]), ''[[The White Sister (1933 film)|The White Sister]]'' (opposite [[Clark Gable]]), ''[[Another Language]]'' (opposite [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]]), ''[[What Every Woman Knows (1934 film)|What Every Woman Knows]]'' (a reprise of her Broadway hit), and ''[[Vanessa: Her Love Story]]'' also with Robert Montgomery. But Hayes did not prefer film to the stage.\n\nHayes eventually returned to Broadway in 1935, where for three years she played the title role in [[Gilbert Miller]]'s production of ''[[Victoria Regina (play)|Victoria Regina]]'', with [[Vincent Price]] as Prince Albert, first at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] and later at the [[Martin Beck Theatre]].\n\n[[File:What Every Woman Knows 1934.JPG|thumb|Hayes in the film ''What Every Woman Knows'' (1934)]]\nIn 1951, she was involved in the Broadway revival of [[J.M. Barrie]]'s play ''[[Mary Rose (play)|Mary Rose]]'' at the [[August Wilson Theatre|ANTA Playhouse]]. In 1953, she was the first-ever recipient of the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her work in [[Chicago theatre]], repeating as the winner in 1969. She returned to Hollywood in the 1950s, and her film star began to rise. She starred in ''[[My Son John]]'' (1952) and ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), and won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as an elderly stowaway in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970). She followed that up with several roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films such as ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'', ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing]]'' and ''[[Candleshoe]]''. Her performance in ''Anastasia'' was considered a comeback\u2014she had suspended her career for several years due to her daughter Mary's death and her husband's failing health.\n\nIn 1955, the [[Fulton Theatre/Helen Hayes Theatre|Fulton Theatre]] was renamed for her. In the 1980s, business interests wished to raze that theatre and four others to construct a large hotel that included the [[Marquis Theatre]]. Hayes's consent to raze the theatre named for her was sought and given, though she had no ownership interest in the building. Parts of the original Helen Hayes Theatre on Broadway were used to construct [[the Shakespeare Center]] on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which Hayes dedicated with [[Joseph Papp]] in 1982.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', September 13, 1982</ref> In 1983 the Little Theater on West 45th Street was renamed the [[Helen Hayes Theatre]] in her honor, as was a theatre in Nyack, which has since been renamed the Riverspace-Arts Center. In early 2014, the site was refurbished and styled by interior designer Dawn Hershko and reopened as the Playhouse Market, a quaint restaurant and gourmet deli.\n\nHayes, who spoke with her good friend [[Anita Loos]] almost daily on the phone, told her, \"I used to think New York was the most enthralling place in the world. I'll bet it still is and if I were free next summer, I would prove it.\" With that, she convinced Loos to embark on an exploration of all five boroughs of New York. They visited and explored the city; Bellevue Hospital at night, a tugboat hauling garbage out to sea, parties, libraries, and Puerto Rican markets. They spoke to everyday people to see how they lived their lives and what made the city tick. The result of this collaborative effort was the book ''Twice Over Lightly'', published in 1972.\n\nIt is unclear when or by whom Hayes was called the \"First Lady of the Theatre\". Her friend, actress [[Katharine Cornell]], also held that title, and each thought the other deserved it.<ref name=autogenerated1>Mosel, p.unknown</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771605,00.html \"The Theatre: Great Katharine\"].

The center protects and preserves North America's native plants and natural landscapes.<ref>[http://www.wildflower.org/about/ \"About Us, History\"] Wildflower.org, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\nThe [[Helen Hayes Award]] for theater in the Washington, DC, area is named in her honor.

Some of these books' themes include her return to Roman Catholicism (she had been denied communion from the Church for the duration of her marriage to [[Charles MacArthur]], who was a [[divorce]]d Protestant); and the death of her only daughter, Mary (1930\u20131949), an aspiring actress, of [[polio]] at the age of 19. Hayes's adopted son, [[James MacArthur]] (1937\u20132010), went on to a career in acting, starring in ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' on television. Hayes guest-starred on ''Hawaii Five-O'' in the 1975 episode \"Retire in Sunny Hawaii... Forever\" and later, in 1980, both appeared in ''[[The Love Boat]]'' episode \"No Girls for Doc/Marriage of Convenience/The Caller/The Witness\".\n\nHayes was hospitalized a number of times for [[asthma]], which was aggravated by stage dust, forcing her to retire from theater in 1971, at age 71.<ref>Anderson, Ruth Nathan. \"Helen Hayes Discovers She's Allergic to Dust,\" ''Boca Raton News'', November 23, 1980</ref><ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nHer last Broadway show was a 1970 revival of ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'', in which she co-starred with [[James Stewart]].

She was extremely proud of the strides the hospital made toward the rehabilitation of people with disabilities, saying: \"I've seen my name in lights on theater marquees and in letters 20 feet tall on Broadway billboards, but nothing has ever given me greater sense of pride and satisfaction than my 49-year association with this unique hospital.\"<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|title=Pretty Penny to host Helen Hayes Hospital fundraiser - Lohud Rockland Blog|access-date=2017-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322020040/http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|archive-date=2017-03-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Helen Hayes MacArthur on the grounds of Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.jpg|right|thumb|Helen Hayes at Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.]]\nHayes became involved with the hospital in the 1940s, and was named to the Board of Visitors in 1944. In 1974, the hospital was renamed in her honor. She served on the Helen Hayes Hospital Board of Visitors for 49 years, until her death in 1993. In that time, she advocated tirelessly for the hospital, and successfully led a fight to prevent its relocation to Albany in the 1960s. In the 1970s, she was instrumental in lobbying for funding to transform the hospital into a state-of-the-art facility.\n\nHayes also contributed her enthusiastic support to hospital events and fund-raising efforts, including handing out diplomas to the children upon graduation when the hospital was still a pediatric care facility. She also faithfully attended the hospital's annual Classic Race, leading it in a classic car, handing out awards to runners, hand cyclists, and wheelchair racers, and offering the use of her home, Pretty Penny, for a dinner to launch the hospital's endowment fund.<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\"/>\n\n==Death==\nHayes died on March 17, 1993, of [[congestive heart failure]] in [[Nyack, New York]]. Hayes's friend [[Lillian Gish]], the \"First Lady of American Cinema\", was the designated beneficiary of her estate, but Gish had died less than a month earlier.

He received painting classes from several artists such as Andr\u00e9 Bergeron and Gozlan. From the age of 25, he gradually devoted himself to painting, gradually forming his style. In 1970, he opened an art studio in Orly.<ref>{{cite web|title=29art \u2013 artist gallery|url= http://29art.com/e/index.php?document_srl=15960&dummy=1|date=2020-02-04|access-date=2020-02-04|language=en}}</ref> \n\nHis first exhibition took place in 1970 in the [[Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants]] in Paris.

He received painting classes from several artists such as Andr\u00e9 Bergeron and Gozlan. From the age of 25, he gradually devoted himself to painting, gradually forming his style. In 1970, he opened an art studio in Orly.<ref>{{cite web|title=29art \u2013 artist gallery|url= http://29art.com/e/index.php?document_srl=15960&dummy=1|date=2020-02-04|access-date=2020-02-04|language=en}}</ref> \n\nHis first exhibition took place in 1970 in the [[Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants]] in Paris. His works have been exhibited in Switzerland, Japan, Sweden, Norway, Germany, Belgium, Japan and the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jean Fernand biography|url= https://www.marcel-spilliaert.com/jean-fernand-1948--2066|date=2020-02-04|access-date=2020-02-04|language=en}}</ref> \nDuring the seventies, he illustrated also some stories by [[Edgar Allen Poe]] for the publishing house Cercle Europ\u00e9en du Livre. He became friends with the painter Francis Goubault, originally from [[Choisy-le-Roi]]. Together, they created different frescoes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Francis Goubault biography|url= http://francis-goubault.com/|date=2020-02-04|access-date=2020-02-04|language=en}}</ref> \n\nHe won several art prizes, including the first prize at [[L\u00e9zignan-Corbi\u00e8res]] in 2003.\n\n==Selected works==\n<ref>{{cite web|title=Marcel Spillaert - Jean Fernand Biography|url= https://www.marcel-spilliaert.com/jean-fernand-1948--2066|date=2020-02-04|access-date=2020-02-04|language=en}}</ref>\n\n* ''Banquet'' (60 x 30 cm)\n* ''Foule'' (103 cm x 17 cm)\n* ''Traversee du desert'' (93 cm x 46 cm)\n* ''Concerto'' (41 x 53 cm)\n* ''Conciliabule'' (43 x 43 cm)\n* ''La Gente Dame'' (painting, 22 x 16 cm)\n* ''Bouquet de Roses'' (65 x 81 cm)\n* ''Couple'' (painting, 74 x 65 cm)<ref>{{cite web|title=Hotel du Parc, Art moderne & Contemporain |url= http://encheres-alsace.fr/files/963_Catalogue%20VP%20Mulhouse%2023%20septembre%202012.pdf |date=2020-02-04|access-date=2020-02-04|language=en}}</ref> \n* ''Le Lever'' (47 x 33 cm)\n* ''Cavali\u00e8re'' (drawing, 23 x 18 cm)\n* ''Au Coeur de la Bataille'' (painting, 28 x 60 cm)\n* ''Troubadour'' (54 x 92 cm)\n* ''Vue au Loin'' (56 x 24 cm)\n* ''Course au Pre'' (80 x 37 cm)\n* ''Notre Dame de Paris'' (60 x 26 cm)\n\n==Selected exhibitions==\n<ref>{{cite web|title=Jean Fernand \u2013 Official curriculum vitae|url= http://fernand.jean.free.fr/act/cv-francais.pdf |date=2020-02-04|access-date=2020-02-04|language=fr}}</ref> \n\n=== French art salons ===\n\n* [[Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants]], [[Grand Palais]], Paris,  (1970\u20131975);\n* Art au Pluriel, [[Ablon]] (1983\u20131984);\n* Le Roi, [[Choisy-le-Roi]] (1985\u20131990);\n* Sculptures en l\u2019\u00eele, [[Andr\u00e9sy]] (2005\u20132006);\n* Salle d'Exposition Francval, [[Arpajon]] (2002\u20132005);\n* Les Artistes du Hurepoix, [[Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve-des-Bois, Essonne]] (2003\u20132006)\n* Salon Espace des Blancs Manteaux, Paris Cour Circuit (2006)\n* March\u00e9 de l'Art de [[Montparnasse]], Paris (2000\u20132008)\n* La Nuit des Soudeurs, [[Granville, Manche]] (2007)\n* Grand March\u00e9 d'Art Contemporain, [[Bastille]] Paris (2003\u20132008)\n* Trot'art, [[Lognes]] (2004)\n* Thirache Fermi\u00e8re, [[Vervins]] (2004, 2006, 2008, 2010)\n* Brocant'art, [[Conie-Molitard]] (2010, 2012)\n* [[Authon-du-Perche]] (2012)\n* Courant d'Art, [[La Bazoche-Gouet]] (2012)\n* [[Moigny-sur-\u00c9cole]] (2012, 2013)\n* R\u00e9cup'art, [[Roubaix]] (2004\u20132013)\n* Courant d'Art, [[Nogent-le-Rotrou]] (2013)\n\n===Exhibitions in Japan ===\n\nBetween 2008 and 2014, Jean Fernand did several [[traveling exhibition]]s in Japan, where he still actually lives.\n\n* [[Mitsukoshi]] department store in [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagoya]]\n* Art Gallery, [[Yamagata, Yamagata]]\n* [[Isetan]] department store in [[Tokyo]]\n* [[Daimaru]] department store in [[Fukuoka]]\n\n== Galeries ==\n\n* [[Galerie Ror Volmar]], Paris, France (1970\u20131973);\n* Galerie Ror Volmar, [[Vichy]], France (1971\u20131973);\n* [[Orly Airport]], Orly, France (1972);\n* Catya Graneuf, Paris, France (1974);\n* Galerie du Comte de Vallombreuse, Biarritz, France (1974\u20131975);\n* Belle Epine, [[Basel]], Switzerland\n* Galerie Lambert Monet, [[Geneva]], Switzerland (1976);\n* Galerie Place du march\u00e9, [[Nogent-le-Rotrou]], France (1980);\n* Le Jardin des Arts, [[Ris-Orangis]] (1984\u20132014);\n* Galerie d'art, [[Moret-sur-Loing]], France (1985, 1986, 1987);\n* Galerie de Belle \u00e9pine P.
