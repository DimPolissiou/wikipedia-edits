They are large and muscular semi-longhair cats with a soft and silky coat. Developed by [[United States|American]] breeder Ann Baker in the 1960s, they are best known for their docile and placid temperament and affectionate nature. The name \"Ragdoll\" is derived from the tendency of individuals from the original breeding stock to go limp and relaxed when picked up.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HYt3zSa9N1EC&pg=PA84&dq=ragdoll+cat+flop&hl=en&sa=X&ei=5WQNUaX_GfLU0gG16YDoDA&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=ragdoll%20cat%20flop&f=false |title=Why Do Cats Always Land on Their Feet?: 101 of the Most Perplexing Questions ... \u2013 Marty Becker, Gina Spadafori \u2013 Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2006-09-16 |accessdate=2014-08-15}}</ref> \n\nParticularly popular in both the United Kingdom and the breed's native United States, ragdoll cats often are known as \"[[Puppy cat|dog-like cats]]\" or \"puppy-like cats\" due to behaviours such as their tendency to follow people around, their ease when physically handled, and their relative lack of aggression toward other pets.<ref name=ideal>{{cite book|title=Your Ideal Cat: Insights Into Breed and Gender Differences in Cat Behavior|author1=Benjamin L.

Josephine was of a [[Persian cat|Persian]]/[[Turkish Angora|Angora]] type and had litters sired by several unknown males [[Birman]] or [[Burmese cat|Burmese]]-like cats, one of which had the [[Siamese cat|Siamese]] point coloration. Josephine later produced kittens with a docile, placid temperament, affectionate nature, and a tendency to go limp and relaxed when picked up.<ref name=\"Helgren2006\"/>\n\nWhen a subsequent litter produced more of the same, Ann Baker purchased several kittens from her neighbour who lived behind her and, believing that she had something special, set out to create what is now known as the ragdoll. The breed was selectively bred over many years for desirable traits, such as large size, gentle demeanour, pointed coloration, and a tendency to go limp when picked up.<ref name=\"Helgren2006\"/>\n\nOut of those early litters came Blackie, an all-black Burmese-like male, and Daddy Warbucks, a seal point with white feet. Daddy Warbucks sired the founding bi-coloured female Fugianna, and Blackie sired Buckwheat, a dark brown/black Burmese-like female. Both Fugianna and Buckwheat were daughters of Josephine. All Ragdolls are descended from Baker's cats through matings of Daddy Warbucks to Fugianna and Buckwheat.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ragdollhistoricalsociety.com/ragdoll-history.php |title=Ragdoll History-The Beginning |publisher=Ragdoll Historical Society |accessdate=2014-10-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218211300/http://ragdollhistoricalsociety.com/ragdoll-history.php |archive-date=2015-02-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nBaker, in an unusual move, spurned traditional cat-breeding associations. She trademarked the name ''Ragdoll'', set up her own registry \u2013 the International Ragdoll Cat Association (IRCA) \u2013  around 1971, and enforced stringent standards on anyone who wanted to breed or sell cats under that name.<ref name=\"Helgren2006\">{{cite web |last=Helgren |first=J.

IRCA cats are not recognized in any major cat breed organization or cat show.\n\nIn 1975, a group led by a husband-and-wife team, Denny and Laura Dayton, broke ranks with the IRCA with the aim of gaining mainstream recognition for the Ragdoll. Beginning with a breeding pair of IRCA cats, this group eventually developed the Ragdoll standard currently accepted by major cat registries such as the [[Cat Fanciers' Association|CFA]] and the [[FIFe]].<ref name=raistrickragdolls>{{cite web|url=http://www.raistrickragdolls.co.uk/ragdoll-cats.php|title=Raistrick Ragdolls|website=Raistrickragdfolls.co.uk|accessdate=15 November 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129045115/http://www.raistrickragdolls.co.uk/ragdoll-cats.php|archivedate=29 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring or after the spread of the Ragdoll breed in America during the early 1960s, a breeding pair of Ragdolls was exported to the UK. This pair was followed by eight more cats to fully establish the breed in the UK, where it is recognised by the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gccfcats.org/breeds.html|title=Welcome to the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy|accessdate=2010-12-14|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121208085015/http://www.gccfcats.org/breeds.html|archivedate=2012-12-08}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, a second group decided to leave the IRCA and form its own group, owing to increasingly strict breeding restrictions. This group later established the [[Ragamuffin (cat)|Ragamuffin]] breed. Because Baker owned the rights to the name \"Ragdoll\", no offshoot groups were legally able to call their cats Ragdolls until 2005, when the trademark on \"Ragdoll\" was not renewed.<ref>U.S. trademark number 1,026,916.</ref>\n\nThe largest international Ragdoll breed club is the Ragdoll Fanciers' Club International (RFCI).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rfci.org/ |title=Ragdoll Fanciers Club International- Ragdoll Cat Breeders Club \u2013 Welcome |publisher=Rfci.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-15}}</ref>\n\n==Breed description==\n\n===Temperament===\n[[File:Flame point Ragdoll.jpg|thumb|A flame (red) [[point coloration|point]] ragdoll]]\nThe Ragdoll is marketed by breeders as having a docile, calm and floppy nature, with claims that these characteristics have been passed down from the Persian and Birman breeds.

Ragdolls can be trained to retrieve toys and enjoy doing so.<ref name=ideal/>\n\n===Physical characteristics===\nThe Ragdoll is one of the largest domesticated cat breeds, with a sturdy body, large frame, and proportionate legs. A fully-grown female weighs from {{convert|8|to|15|lb|kg}}. Males are substantially larger, ranging from {{convert|12|to|20|lb|kg}} or more.<ref name=\"Helgren2006\"/> The genes for point coloration are responsible for the distinctive blue eyes of the Ragdoll. More intense shades of blue are favored in cat shows. Although the breed has a plush coat, it consists mainly of long guard hairs, while the lack of dense undercoat results, according to the Cat Fanciers' Association, in \"reduced shedding and matting\".<ref>[http://www.cfa.org/breeds/profiles/ragdoll.html Breed Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714202130/http://www.cfa.org/breeds/profiles/ragdoll.html |date=2009-07-14 }} Cat Fanciers' Association</ref>\n\nRagdolls come in six different colours: red, seal, chocolate and the corresponding \"dilutes\", including blue, lilac, and cream.

Ragdoll kittens are born white; they have good color at 8\u201310 weeks and full colour and coat at 3\u20134 years. The three different patterns are:\n*Colorpoint \u2013 One colour darkening at the extremities (nose, ears, tail, and paws).\n*Mitted \u2013 Same as pointed, but with white paws and abdomen. With or without a blaze (a white line or spot on the face), but must have a \"belly stripe\" (white stripe that runs from the chin to the genitals) and a white chin. Mitted Ragdolls, which weren't allowed titling in CFA until the 2008\u20132009 show season, are often confused with Birmans. The easiest way to tell the difference is by size (the Ragdoll being obviously larger) and chin color (Mitted Ragdolls have white chins,<ref name=\"mittedragdoll\">{{cite book|title=The Ragdoll Cat|publisher=capstone press|page=19|last1=Mattern|first1=Joanne}}</ref> while Birmans have colored chins), although breeders recognize the two by head shape and boning.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n*[[Bicolor cat|Bicolor]] \u2013 White legs, white inverted ''V'' on the face, white abdomen and sometimes white patches on the back.

They are large and muscular semi-longhair cats with a soft and silky coat. Developed by [[United States|American]] breeder Ann Baker in the 1960s, they are best known for their docile and placid temperament and affectionate nature. The name \"Ragdoll\" is derived from the tendency of individuals from the original breeding stock to go limp and relaxed when picked up.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HYt3zSa9N1EC&pg=PA84&dq=ragdoll+cat+flop&hl=en&sa=X&ei=5WQNUaX_GfLU0gG16YDoDA&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=ragdoll%20cat%20flop&f=false |title=Why Do Cats Always Land on Their Feet?: 101 of the Most Perplexing Questions ... \u2013 Marty Becker, Gina Spadafori \u2013 Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2006-09-16 |accessdate=2014-08-15}}</ref> \n\nParticularly popular in both the United Kingdom and the breed's native United States, ragdoll cats often are known as \"[[Puppy cat|dog-like cats]]\" or \"puppy-like cats\" due to behaviors such as their tendency to follow people around, their ease when physically handled, and their relative lack of aggression toward other pets.<ref name=ideal>{{cite book|title=Your Ideal Cat: Insights Into Breed and Gender Differences in Cat Behavior|author1=Benjamin L.

Josephine was of a [[Persian cat|Persian]]/[[Turkish Angora|Angora]] type and had litters sired by several unknown male [[Birman]] or [[Burmese cat|Burmese]]-like cats, one of which had the [[Siamese cat|Siamese]] point coloration. Josephine later produced kittens with a docile, placid temperament, affectionate nature, and a tendency to go limp and relaxed when picked up.<ref name=\"Helgren2006\"/>\n\nWhen a subsequent litter produced more of the same, Ann Baker purchased several kittens from her neighbor who lived behind her and, believing that she had something special, set out to create what is now known as the ragdoll. The breed was selectively bred over many years for desirable traits, such as large size, gentle demeanor, pointed coloration, and a tendency to go limp when picked up.<ref name=\"Helgren2006\"/>\n\nOut of those early litters came Blackie, an all black Burmese-like male, and Daddy Warbucks, a seal point with white feet. Daddy Warbucks sired the founding bi-color female Fugianna, and Blackie sired Buckwheat, a dark brown/black Burmese-like female. Both Fugianna and Buckwheat were daughters of Josephine. All Ragdolls are descended from Baker's cats through matings of Daddy Warbucks to Fugianna and Buckwheat.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ragdollhistoricalsociety.com/ragdoll-history.php |title=Ragdoll History-The Beginning |publisher=Ragdoll Historical Society |accessdate=2014-10-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218211300/http://ragdollhistoricalsociety.com/ragdoll-history.php |archive-date=2015-02-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nBaker, in an unusual move, spurned traditional cat-breeding associations. She trademarked the name ''Ragdoll'', set up her own registry \u2013 the International Ragdoll Cat Association (IRCA) \u2013  around 1971, and enforced stringent standards on anyone who wanted to breed or sell cats under that name.<ref name=\"Helgren2006\">{{cite web |last=Helgren |first=J.

IRCA cats are not recognized in any major cat breed organization or cat show.\n\nIn 1975, a group led by a husband-and-wife team, Denny and Laura Dayton, broke ranks with the IRCA with the aim of gaining mainstream recognition for the Ragdoll. Beginning with a breeding pair of IRCA cats, this group eventually developed the Ragdoll standard currently accepted by major cat registries such as the [[Cat Fanciers' Association|CFA]] and the [[FIFe]].<ref name=raistrickragdolls>{{cite web|url=http://www.raistrickragdolls.co.uk/ragdoll-cats.php|title=Raistrick Ragdolls|website=Raistrickragdfolls.co.uk|accessdate=15 November 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129045115/http://www.raistrickragdolls.co.uk/ragdoll-cats.php|archivedate=29 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring or after the spread of the Ragdoll breed in America during the early 1960s, a breeding pair of Ragdolls was exported to the UK. This pair was followed by eight more cats to fully establish the breed in the UK, where it is recognised by the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gccfcats.org/breeds.html|title=Welcome to the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy|accessdate=2010-12-14|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121208085015/http://www.gccfcats.org/breeds.html|archivedate=2012-12-08}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, a second group decided to leave the IRCA and form its own group, owing to increasingly strict breeding restrictions. This group later established the [[Ragamuffin (cat)|Ragamuffin]] breed. Because Baker owned the rights to the name \"Ragdoll\", no offshoot groups were legally able to call their cats Ragdolls until 2005, when the trademark on \"Ragdoll\" was not renewed.<ref>U.S. trademark number 1,026,916.</ref>\n\nThe largest international Ragdoll breed club is the Ragdoll Fanciers' Club International (RFCI).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rfci.org/ |title=Ragdoll Fanciers Club International- Ragdoll Cat Breeders Club \u2013 Welcome |publisher=Rfci.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-15}}</ref>\n\n==Breed description==\n\n===Temperament===\n[[File:Flame point Ragdoll.jpg|thumb|A flame (red) [[point coloration|point]] ragdoll]]\nThe Ragdoll is marketed by breeders as having a docile, calm and floppy nature, with claims that these characteristics have been passed down from the Persian and Birman breeds.

Although the breed has a plush coat, it consists mainly of long guard hairs, while the lack of a dense undercoat results, according to the Cat Fanciers' Association, in \"reduced shedding and matting\".<ref>[http://www.cfa.org/breeds/profiles/ragdoll.html Breed Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714202130/http://www.cfa.org/breeds/profiles/ragdoll.html |date=2009-07-14 }} Cat Fanciers' Association</ref>\n\nRagdolls come in six different colors: red, seal, chocolate and the corresponding \"dilutes\", including blue, lilac, and cream.

Ragdoll kittens are born white; they have good color at 8\u201310 weeks and full color and coat at 3\u20134 years.

Mitted Ragdolls, which weren't allowed titling in CFA until the 2008\u20132009 show season, are often confused with Birmans.

Turner|Timmy Turner's]] Fairy-versary, a magical event that only occurs when a godchild is able to keep his/her fairies a secret for an entire year. After receiving numerous magical gifts, Jorgen Von Strangle gives Timmy a magical muffin that allows anyone who eats it to have a \"rule-free\" wish. Timmy then asks how he got [[List of The Fairly OddParents characters#Cosmo|Cosmo]] and [[List of The Fairly OddParents characters#Wanda|Wanda]] as his godparents. Wanda shows through a flashback that his parents lied to an 8-year old Timmy and tricked him into hiring [[List of The Fairly OddParents characters#Vicky|Vicky]] as his babysitter. Upset, Timmy inadvertently wishes that his parents could tell the truth. Mr. and Mrs. Turner begin to feel guilty and they start counting the many times they have lied to Timmy. Timmy takes the muffin to school, but is followed by [[List of The Fairly OddParents characters#Denzel Crocker|Mr. Crocker]] who detects the magic within the muffin. Crocker attempts to retrieve the muffin, but only manages to get it out of Timmy's possession. Crocker chains Timmy down during class in order to get to the muffin first, but Timmy wishes himself free. During muffin day at lunch, Timmy sees Crocker frantically searching for the muffin, which leads Timmy to initiate a food fight. The muffin ends up in the paws of Bippy, a monkey that Timmy sets free, and he takes a bite of the muffin. Suddenly, the whole world is transformed, leaving monkeys the rulers of Earth. To make matters worse, Timmy loses his Godparents when Jorgen announces to all fairies that Da Rules say they have to be Godparents of the \"dominant species\" on Earth: monkeys. Bippy ends up getting Cosmo and Wanda as godparents.\n\nTimmy, who still remembers Cosmo and Wanda, follows Bippy to try to get him to unwish everything. Timmy returns to Mr. Crocker's class, who is now ranting about Apes using fairies to take over the world. Mr. Crocker is taken by the apes to a place off-limits to Humans. With Crocker gone, Timmy enters the Crocker Cave and steals a magic detector. He uses the magic detector to track down Bippy, whom he finds with the Fairy-versary muffin along with Cosmo and Wanda. Timmy almost succeeds in retrieving the muffin, but is captured by the Apes and brought to the human testing center along with Mr. Crocker and Francis. Crocker is to be dissected first, but he fearfully begs for Timmy to be taken instead. Timmy is taken to a surgical room where his skull is about to be drilled into when Bippy showed up to rescue him. Bippy manages to fight off the apes at first, but is eventually overwhelmed.\n\nLuckily, due to Cosmo's 'paraphrasing' of Bippy's wish, which Cosmo claims could just as easily have been for another banana, everything is unwished moments before Timmy was about to be harmed. Unfortunately, Bippy also lost the muffin during the scuffle, and immediately after the world is returned to normal, Crocker finds the muffin, takes a bite, and wishes he could catch a fairy. He obtains a butterfly net (one of the few items a fairy's magic has no effect on) and captures Wanda. Cosmo is devastated and Bippy flees. Timmy realizes that the first thing Crocker will do with his newfound power is rub it in the face of his students, so he rushes back to his school. With his new-found power, Crocker appears in a power armor suit which has Wanda trapped in a scepter and the Fairy-versary muffin within the chest cavity. He terrorizes his students by turning them into ice statues (he wanted to turn them into ash), turning Sanjay and Chester's heads into toilets when they asked to go the bathroom, and then chases Timmy off as he transforms the world and makes himself the all-powerful magical leader.\n\nTimmy arms himself with the various gifts he got from his Fairy-versary party, and goes to confront Crocker. Crocker abuses Wanda's magic by having the citizens bow down to him and make them eat shrimp puffs. Timmy disguised as a masked hero engages Crocker in a magical duel. Crocker has the upper hand, until Cosmo returns with \"5-second massive pecs\" and pummels him. However, Cosmo lets his guard down, and he too is captured. Timmy and Crocker fight through [[spacetime|space and time]] before Timmy's cover is blown. Crocker decides to threaten Timmy's parents realizing he cannot destroy him with magic. Returning home, Timmy (now locked in chains due to Crocker) sees his parents under the mercy of Crocker and surrenders. Timmy and his parents reconcile. Left with no other choice, Timmy reveals that Cosmo and Wanda are his fairy godparents, breaking the sacred cardinal law of Da Rules. This results in Cosmo and Wanda breaking free of Crocker's control, and are sent back to Fairy World. With Crocker now powerless, Mr. and Mrs. Turner start pummeling him, knocking the muffin out of his possession. Timmy grabs and eats the rest of the muffin, and wishes for his godparents to return. After poofing away the chains binding Timmy, Timmy then wishes for everything to be back to normal. Back at school, Crocker attempts to convince everyone that fairies exist and that they will all bow down to him, but no one believes him. Crocker is then injected with medicine and sent to a mental institution. Jorgen shows up in Timmy's room and says that, even though everything is fixed, he still broke Da Rules. Before he can take Cosmo and Wanda away, Timmy throws the Forget-Me-Knob (a magical item that was used in the beginning to keep Timmy's parents away from the party) at Jorgen's head, who [[amnesia|forgets what he was doing]].

Turner|Timmy Turner's]] Fairy-versary, a magical event that only occurs when a godchild is able to keep his/her fairies a secret for an entire year. After receiving numerous magical gifts, Jorgen Von Strangle gives Timmy a magical muffin that allows anyone who eats it to have a \"rule-free\" wish. Timmy then asks how he got [[List of The Fairly OddParents characters#Cosmo|Cosmo]] and [[List of The Fairly OddParents characters#Wanda|Wanda]] as his godparents. Wanda shows through a flashback that his parents lied to an 8-year old Timmy and tricked him into hiring [[List of The Fairly OddParents characters#Vicky|Vicky]] as his babysitter. Upset, Timmy inadvertently wishes that his parents could tell the truth. Mr. and Mrs. Turner begin to feel guilty and they start counting the many times they have lied to Timmy. Timmy takes the muffin to school, but is followed by [[List of The Fairly OddParents characters#Denzel Crocker|Mr. Crocker]] who detects the magic within the muffin. Crocker attempts to retrieve the muffin, but only manages to get it out of Timmy's possession. Crocker chains Timmy down during class in order to get to the muffin first, but Timmy wishes himself free. During muffin day at lunch, Timmy sees Crocker frantically searching for the muffin, which leads Timmy to initiate a food fight. The muffin ends up in the paws of Bippy, a monkey that Timmy sets free, and he takes a bite of the muffin. Suddenly, the whole world is transformed, leaving monkeys the rulers of Earth. To make matters worse, Timmy loses his Godparents when Jorgen announces to all fairies that Da Rules say they have to be Godparents of the \"dominant species\" on Earth: monkeys. Bippy ends up getting Cosmo and Wanda as godparents.\n\nTimmy, who still remembers Cosmo and Wanda, follows Bippy to try to get him to unwish everything. Timmy returns to Mr. Crocker's class, who is now ranting about Apes using fairies to take over the world. Mr. Crocker is taken by the apes to a place off-limits to Humans. With Crocker gone, Timmy enters the Crocker Cave and steals a magic detector. He uses the magic detector to track down Bippy, whom he finds with the Fairy-versary muffin along with Cosmo and Wanda. Timmy almost succeeds in retrieving the muffin, but is captured by the Apes and brought to the human testing center along with Mr. Crocker and Francis. Crocker is to be dissected first, but he fearfully begs for Timmy to be taken instead. Timmy is taken to a surgical room where his skull is about to be drilled into when Bippy showed up to rescue him. Bippy manages to fight off the apes at first, but is eventually overwhelmed.\n\nLuckily, due to Cosmo's 'paraphrasing' of Bippy's wish, which Cosmo claims could just as easily have been for another banana, everything is unwished moments before Timmy was about to be harmed. Unfortunately, Bippy also lost the muffin during the scuffle, and immediately after the world is returned to normal, Crocker finds the muffin, takes a bite, and wishes he could catch a fairy. He obtains a butterfly net (one of the few items a fairy's magic has no effect on) and captures Wanda. Cosmo is devastated and Bippy flees. Timmy realizes that the first thing Crocker will do with his newfound power is rub it in the face of his students, so he rushes back to his school. With his new-found power, Crocker appears in a power armor suit which has Wanda trapped in a scepter and the Fairy-versary muffin within the chest cavity. He terrorizes his students by turning them into ice statues (he wanted to turn them into ash), turning Sanjay and Chester's heads into toilets when they asked to go the bathroom, and then chases Timmy off as he transforms the world and makes himself the all-powerful magical leader.\n\nTimmy arms himself with the various gifts he got from his Fairy-versary party, and goes to confront Crocker. Crocker abuses Wanda's magic by having the citizens bow down to him and make them eat shrimp puffs. Timmy disguised as a masked hero engages Crocker in a magical duel. Crocker has the upper hand, until Cosmo returns with \"5-second massive pecs\" and pummels him. However, Cosmo lets his guard down, and he too is captured. Timmy and Crocker fight through [[spacetime|space and time]] before Timmy's cover is blown. Crocker decides to threaten Timmy's parents realizing he cannot destroy him with magic. Returning home, Timmy (now locked in chains due to Crocker) sees his parents under the mercy of Crocker and surrenders. Timmy and his parents reconcile. Left with no other choice, Timmy reveals that Cosmo and Wanda are his fairy godparents, breaking the sacred cardinal law of Da Rules. This results in Cosmo and Wanda breaking free of Crocker's control, and are sent back to Fairy World. With Crocker now powerless, Mr. and Mrs. Turner start pummeling him, knocking the muffin out of his possession. Timmy grabs and eats the rest of the muffin, and wishes for his godparents to return. After poofing away the chains binding Timmy, Timmy then wishes for everything to be back to normal. Back at school, Crocker attempts to convince everyone that fairies exist and that they will all bow down to him, but no one believes him. Crocker is then injected with medicine and sent to a mental institution. Jorgen shows up in Timmy's room and says that, even though everything is fixed, he still broke Da Rules. Before he can take Cosmo and Wanda away, Timmy throws the Forget-Me-Knob (a magical item that was used in the beginning to keep Timmy's parents away from the party) at Jorgen's head, who [[amnesia|forgets what he was doing]]. Cosmo and Wanda then trick him into \"assigning\" Timmy as their godchild to which Jorgen agrees. Timmy reminds them that he \"just got fairy godparents\", so Cosmo and Wanda reenact their first meeting with Timmy.\n\n==Cast==\n*'''[[Tara Strong]]''' as Timmy Turner / Kid\n*'''[[Daran Norris]]''' as Cosmo / Mr. Turner / Jorgen Von Strangle\n*'''[[Susanne Blakeslee]]''' as Wanda / Mrs. Turner\n*'''[[Carlos Alazraqui]]''' as Denzel Crocker / Ape\n*'''[[Grey DeLisle]]''' as Vicky / Principal Waxelplax / Tootie/ Flashback Fariy\n*'''[[Dee Bradley Baker]]''' as Bippy / Sanjay / Elmer / Kid / Fairy Private\n*'''[[Tom Kenny]]''' as Cupid / Muffin Man / Kid / Fairy Sergeant/ Flashback Fariy\n*'''[[Jason Marsden]]''' as Chester McBadbat\n*'''[[Gary LeRoi Gray]]''' as A.J.\n*'''[[Robert Costanzo]]''' as Easter Bunny / Construction Worker Ape / Ape Truck Driver\n*'''[[Faith Abrahams]]''' as Francis / Ape\n*'''[[Butch Hartman]]''' as Flashback Boy / [[Jar Jar Binks|Web-Eared Guy]] / Third Kid / Orderly\n*'''Cara Newman Ruyle''' as Flashback Girl / Female Ape #1 / Gorilla Business Woman\n*'''[[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]]''' as Chet Ubetcha\n*'''Gary Le Mel''' as Fairy Cowlick Jr. (voice)\n\n==Release==\n\"Abra-Catastrophe!\" premiered on July 12, 2003.<ref name=Date/> Attracting over 4 million views, the television film was the highest rated film on basic cable on the week it premiered.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ryan|first=Suzanne C.|title=`OddParents' soaks up `SpongeBob' spot|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-08-19/features/0308190258_1_oddparents-butch-hartman-nickelodeon|accessdate=April 11, 2017|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=August 19, 2003|language=en}}</ref> \"Abra-Catastrophe\" was released on a DVD and VHS tape of the same name on July 15, 2003 by Nickelodeon and [[Paramount Home Media Distribution|Paramount Home Entertainment]].
