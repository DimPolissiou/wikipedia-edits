Unlike [[depth charge]]s, mines are deposited and left to wait until they are triggered by the approach of, or contact with, any vessel. Naval mines can be used offensively, to hamper enemy shipping movements or lock vessels into a [[harbour]]; or defensively, to protect friendly vessels and create \"safe\" zones. Mines allow the minelaying force commander to concentrate warships or defensive assets in mine-free areas giving the adversary three choices: undertake an expensive and time-consuming minesweeping effort, accept the casualties of challenging the minefield, or use the unmined waters where the greatest concentration of enemy firepower will be encountered.<ref>{{cite journal |last=McDonald |first=Wesley |authorlink =Wesley L.

Mines may be placed by aircraft, ships, submarines, or individual swimmers and boatmen. Although international law requires signatory nations to declare mined areas, precise locations remain secret; and non-complying individuals may not disclose minelaying. While mines threaten only those who choose to traverse waters which may be mined, the possibility of activating a mine is a powerful disincentive to shipping.\n\n\n==Description==\nMines can be laid in many ways: by purpose-built [[minelayer]]s, refitted ships, submarines or [[aircraft]]\u2014and even by dropping them into a [[harbour]] by hand. They can be inexpensive: some variants can cost as little as US$2000, though more sophisticated mines can cost millions of dollars, be equipped with several kinds of sensors and deliver a [[warhead]] by [[rocket]] or [[torpedo]].\n\n[[File:British Mk 14 Sea Mine.jpg|thumb|upright|British Mk 14 sea mine]]\n\nTheir flexibility and cost-effectiveness make mines attractive to the less powerful belligerent in [[asymmetric warfare]]. The cost of producing and laying a mine is usually between 0.5% and 10% of the cost of removing it, and it can take up to 200 times as long to clear a minefield as to lay it. Parts of some [[World War II]] naval minefields still exist because they are too extensive and expensive to clear.<ref>{{Citation | author = Paul O'Mahony   | title = Swedish navy locates German WWII mines | newspaper = The Local Europe AB | page =   |  date = 16 June 2009 | url = http://www.thelocal.se/20090616/20102 | accessdate = 8 March 2016}}</ref> Some 1940s-era mines may remain dangerous for many years.\n\nMines have been employed as offensive or defensive weapons in rivers, lakes, estuaries, seas and oceans, but they can also be used as tools of [[psychological warfare]].<!--Tom Clancy once wrote (in ''Submarine'', IIRC), it doesn't take actual mines to make a minefield, just a press release: just because minesweepers don't find any doesn't mean there aren't any...--> Offensive mines are placed in enemy waters, outside harbours and across important shipping routes to sink both merchant and military vessels. Defensive minefields safeguard key stretches of coast from enemy ships and submarines, forcing them into more easily defended areas, or keeping them away from sensitive ones.\n\nShip owners are reluctant to send their ships though known minefields. Port authorities may attempt to clear a mined area, but those without effective minesweeping equipment may cease using the area. Transit of a mined area will be attempted only when strategic interests outweigh potential losses. The decision-maker's perception of the minefield is a critical factor. Minefields designed for psychological effect are usually placed on [[trade route]]s to stop ships from reaching an enemy nation. They are often spread thinly, to create an impression of minefields existing across large areas. A single mine inserted strategically on a shipping route can stop maritime movements for days while the entire area is swept. A mine's capability to sink ships makes it a credible threat, but minefields work more on the mind than on ships.<ref name=G&B/>\n\n[[International law]], specifically the Eighth [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907#Hague Convention of 1907|Hague Convention of 1907]], requires nations to declare when they mine an area, to make it easier for civil shipping to avoid the mines. The warnings do not have to be specific; for example, during World War II, Britain declared simply that it had mined the English Channel, [[North Sea]] and French coast.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Early use===\n[[File:Chinese Naval Mine.JPG|thumb|upright|A 14th-century drawn illustration of a naval mine and page description from the ''[[Huolongjing]]'']]\n\nPrecursors to naval mines were first invented by Chinese innovators of [[History of China|Imperial China]] and were described in thorough detail by the early [[Ming dynasty]] artillery officer [[Jiao Yu]], in his 14th century military treatise known as the ''[[Huolongjing]]''.<ref name=\"needham volume 5 part 7 203 205\">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 203\u2013205.</ref> [[History of Science and Technology in China|Chinese records]] tell of naval explosives in the 16th century, used to fight against Japanese pirates (''[[wokou]]'').

A cable connected it to a [[galvanic cell]] which powered it from the shore, the power of its explosive charge was equal to {{convert|14|kg}} of [[black powder]]. In the summer of 1853, the production of the mine was approved by the Committee for Mines of the [[Ministry of War of the Russian Empire]]. In 1854, 60 Jacobi mines were laid in the vicinity of the Forts Pavel and [[Fort Alexander (Saint Petersburg)|Alexander]] ([[Kronstadt]]), to deter the [[British Baltic Fleet]] from attacking them. It gradually phased out its direct competitor the [[Nobel mine]] on the insistence of Admiral [[Fyodor Litke]]. The Nobel mines were bought from Swedish industrialist [[Immanuel Nobel]] who had entered into [[collusion]] with Russian head of navy [[Alexander Sergeyevich Menshikov]]. Despite their high cost (100 [[Russian ruble]]s) the Nobel mines proved to be faulty, exploding while being laid, failing to explode or detaching from their wires and drifting uncontrollably, at least 70 of them were subsequently disarmed by the British. In 1855, 301 more Jacobi mines were laid around Krostadt and [[Lisy Nos]]. British ships did not dare to approach them.{{sfn|Tarle|1944|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nIn the 19th century, mines were called [[torpedo]]es, a name probably conferred by [[Robert Fulton]] after the [[torpedo fish]], which gives powerful [[electric shock]]s. A [[spar torpedo]] was a mine attached to a long pole and detonated when the ship carrying it rammed another one and withdrew a safe distance. The submarine {{ship||H. L. Hunley|submarine|2}} used one to sink {{USS|Housatonic|1861|6}} on 17 February 1864. A [[Harvey torpedo]] was a type of floating mine towed alongside a ship and was briefly in service in the [[Royal Navy]] in the 1870s. Other \"torpedoes\" were attached to ships or propelled themselves. One such weapon called the [[Whitehead torpedo]] after its inventor, caused the word \"torpedo\" to apply to self-propelled underwater missiles as well as to static devices. These mobile devices were also known as \"fish torpedoes\".\n\nThe [[American Civil War]] of 1861\u20131865 also saw the successful use of mines. The first ship sunk by a mine, {{USS|Cairo}}, foundered in 1862 in the [[Yazoo River]]. [[Rear Admiral]] [[David Farragut]]'s famous/apocryphal command during the [[Battle of Mobile Bay]] in 1864, \"[[Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!]]\" refers to a minefield laid at [[Mobile, Alabama]].\n\nAfter 1865 the United States adopted the mine as its primary weapon for [[Seacoast defense in the United States|coastal defense]]. In the decade following 1868, Major [[Henry Larcom Abbot]] carried out a lengthy set of experiments to design and test [[Submarine mines in United States harbor defense|moored mines]] that could be exploded on contact or be detonated at will as enemy shipping passed near them. This initial development of mines in the United States took place under the purview of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], which trained officers and men in their use at the [[U.S. Army Engineer School|Engineer School of Application]] at Willets Point, New York (later named [[Fort Totten (Queens)|Fort Totten]]). In 1901 underwater minefields became the responsibility of the US Army's Artillery Corps, and in 1907 this was a founding responsibility of the [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdsg.org/coast-artillery-submarine-mine-defenses/|title=Coast Artillery: Submarine Mine Defenses|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Imperial Russian Navy]], a pioneer in mine warfare, successfully deployed mines against the [[Ottoman Navy]] during both the Crimean War and the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878)]].<ref name= Kowner>{{cite book | last = Kowner| first = Rotem|authorlink=Rotem Kowner| year = 2006 | title = Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War | publisher = The Scarecrow Press | location = |isbn=0-8108-4927-5 }} page 238.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Tamsui]] (1884), in the [[Keelung Campaign]] of the [[Sino-French War]], Chinese forces in Taiwan under [[Liu Mingchuan]] took measures to reinforce [[Tamsui]] against the French; they planted nine torpedo mines in the river and blocked the entrance.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|title=Maritime Taiwan: Historical Encounters with the East and the West\n|issue=|first=Shih-shan Henry|last=Tsai\n|edition=illustrated|year=2009|publisher=M.E.

The toll inflicted by mines was not confined to the Russians, however. The [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Navy]] lost two battleships, four cruisers, two destroyers and a torpedo-boat to offensively laid mines during the war. Most famously, on May 15, 1904, the Russian [[minelayer]] [[Amur-class minelayer (1898)|''Amur'']] planted a 50-mine minefield off [[L\u00fcshunkou District|Port Arthur]] and succeeded in sinking the Japanese battleships {{ship|Japanese battleship|Hatsuse||2}} and {{ship|Japanese battleship|Yashima||2}}.\n\nFollowing the end of the Russo-Japanese War, several nations attempted to have mines banned as weapons of war at the [[Hague Peace Conference (1907)]].<ref name= Kowner/>\n\nMany early mines were fragile and dangerous to handle, as they contained glass containers filled with [[nitroglycerin]] or mechanical devices that activated a blast upon tipping. Several mine-laying ships were destroyed when their cargo exploded.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwideinvention.com/articles/details/312/naval-mine-contained-explosive-device-placed-in-water-to-destroy-ships-or-submarines.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103144718/http://www.worldwideinvention.com/articles/details/312/Naval-mine-contained-explosive-device-placed-in-water-to-destroy-ships-or-submarines.html |archivedate=2013-11-03 }}</ref>\n\nBeginning around the start of the 20th century, submarine mines played a major role in the [[Submarine mines in United States harbor defense|defense of U.S. harbors]] against enemy attack as part of the [[Board of Fortifications|Endicott and Taft Programs]]. The mines employed were controlled mines, anchored to the bottoms of the harbors and detonated under control from large mine [[casemate]]s on shore.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], mines were used extensively to defend coasts, coastal shipping, ports and naval bases around the globe. The Germans laid mines in shipping lanes to sink merchant and naval vessels serving Britain. The Allies targeted the German U-boats in the Strait of Dover and the Hebrides. In an attempt to seal up the northern exits of the North Sea, the Allies developed the [[North Sea Mine Barrage]]. During a period of five months from June 1918 almost 70,000 mines were laid spanning the North Sea's northern exits. The total number of mines laid in the North Sea, the British East Coast, Straits of Dover, and Heligoland Bight is estimated at 190,000 and the total number during the whole of WWI was 235,000 sea mines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seaclimate.com/5/pdf/5_14.pdf|title=Climate Change & Naval War\u2014A Scientific Assessment 2005\u2014Trafford on demand publishing, Canada/UK|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908115540/https://www.seaclimate.com/5/pdf/5_14.pdf|archivedate=2008-09-08}}</ref> Clearing the barrage after the war took 82 ships and five months, working around the clock.<ref>Gilbert, p.4.</ref> It was also during World War I, that the naval mine sunk its largest vessel ever, the British [[hospital ship]], [[HMHS Britannic|HMHS ''Britannic'']], which was the sister ship of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic.'']]\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:L L sweeping gear.jpg|thumb|The towed, electric cables of ''Double-L'', magnetic\u2013mine sweeping gear being deployed behind a Royal Navy minesweeper]]\nDuring [[World War II]], the [[U-boat]] fleet, which dominated much of the battle of the Atlantic, was small at the beginning of the war and much of the early action by German forces involved mining [[convoy]] routes and ports around Britain. German submarines also operated in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], in the [[Caribbean Sea]], and along the U.S. coast.\n\nInitially, contact mines (requiring a ship to physically strike a mine to detonate it) were employed, usually tethered at the end of a cable just below the surface of the water. Contact mines usually blew a hole in ships' hulls. By the beginning of World War II, most nations had developed mines that could be dropped from aircraft, some of which floated on the surface, making it possible to lay them in enemy harbours. The use of dredging and nets was effective against this type of mine, but this consumed valuable time and resources, and required harbours to be closed. Some of these mines have been found and archaeologically conserved.<ref>https://jefpat.maryland.gov/Pages/mac-lab/curators-choice/2019-curators-choice/2019-09-sea-mine-and-anchor.aspx</ref>\n\nLater, some ships survived mine blasts, limping into port with buckled plates and broken backs. This appeared to be due to a new type of mine, detecting ships by their proximity to the mine (an influence mine) and detonating at a distance, causing damage with the shock wave of the explosion. Ships that had successfully run the gauntlet<!-- properly gantlet, not gauntlet --> of the Atlantic crossing were sometimes destroyed entering freshly cleared British harbours. More shipping was being lost than could be replaced, and [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] ordered the intact recovery of one of these new mines to be of the highest priority.\n\nThe British experienced a stroke of luck in November 1939, when a German mine was dropped from an aircraft onto the mud flats off [[Shoeburyness]] during low tide. Additionally, the land belonged to the army and a base with men and workshops was at hand. Experts were dispatched from [[HMS Vernon]] to investigate the mine. The Royal Navy knew that mines could use magnetic sensors, Britain having developed magnetic mines in World War I, so everyone removed all metal, including their buttons, and made tools of non-magnetic [[brass]].<ref>Campbell, John, \"Naval Weapons of World War Two\" (London, UK: Conway Maritime Press, 1985)</ref> They disarmed the mine and rushed it to the labs at HMS Vernon, where scientists discovered that the mine had a magnetic arming mechanism. A large ferrous object passing through the Earth's [[magnetic field]] will concentrate the field through it; the mine's detector was designed to trigger as a ship passed over, when the Earth's magnetic field was concentrated in the ship and away from the mine. The mine detected this loss of the magnetic field which caused it to detonate. The mechanism had an adjustable sensitivity, calibrated in [[Gauss (unit)|milligauss]]. (As it turned out, the German firing mechanism was overly sensitive, making sweeping easier.)<ref>''The Wizard War''.</ref> The U.S. began adding delay counters to their magnetic mines in June 1945.<ref>Parillo, Mark P. ''Japanese Merchant Marine in World War Two'' (Annapolis, Md. : Naval Institute Press, 1993), p.200.</ref>\n\n[[File:Dwi wellington front.jpg|thumb|A [[Vickers Wellington]] fitted with a ''DWI'', magnetic mine exploder, [[Ismailia]], Egypt]]\nFrom this data, known methods were used to clear these mines. Early methods included the use of large electromagnets dragged behind ships or below low-flying aircraft (a number of older bombers like the [[Vickers Wellington]] were used for this). Both of these methods had the disadvantage of \"sweeping\" only a small strip. A better solution was found in the \"Double-L Sweep\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.GoodeveCA.net/CFGoodeve/cfg_bio.html#sweep|title= The Double-L Sweep\u2014Biography of Sir Charles Goodeve}}</ref> using electrical cables dragged behind ships that passed large pulses of current through the seawater. This created a large magnetic field and swept the entire area between the two ships. The older methods continued to be used in smaller areas. The [[Suez Canal]] continued to be swept by aircraft, for instance. Wartime Japanese sweep methods, by contrast, never advanced much past 1930s standards, and failed entirely to keep up with new American mines,<ref name=\"Parillo, p.200\">Parillo, p.200.</ref> clearing no more than 15% of all the mines laid in Japan's coastal waters.<ref name=\"Parillo, p.200\"/> Moreover, IJN's minesweeping force was far too small with 350 ships, and 20,000 men.<ref name=\"Parillo, p.201\">Parillo, p.201.</ref><!--RN ''lost'' that many 'sweepers for the duration!-->\n\nWhile these methods were useful for clearing mines from local ports, they were of little or no use for enemy-controlled areas. These were typically visited by warships, and the majority of the fleet then underwent a massive [[Degaussing#Ships.27 hulls|degaussing]] process, where their hulls had a slight \"south\" bias induced into them which offset the concentration effect almost to zero.\n\nInitially, major warships and large troopships had a copper ''degaussing coil'' fitted around the perimeter of the hull, energized by the ship's electrical system whenever in suspected magnetic-mined waters. Some of the first to be so fitted were the [[aircraft carrier|carrier]] [[HMS Ark Royal (91)|HMS ''Ark Royal'']] and the liners {{RMS|Queen Mary}} and {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth}}. It was a photo of one of these liners in New York harbor, showing the degaussing coil, which revealed to German Naval Intelligence the fact that the British were using degaussing methods to combat their magnetic mines.<ref>Piekalkiewicz, Janusz, \"Sea War: 1939\u20131945\" (Poole, UK: Blandford Press, 1987)</ref> This was felt to be impractical for smaller warships and merchant vessels, mainly because the ships lacked the generating capacity to energise such a coil. It was found that \"wiping\" a current-carrying cable up and down a ship's hull<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.GoodeveCA.net/CFGoodeve/cfg_bio.html#wipe|title= Wiping\u2014Biography of Sir Charles Goodeve}}</ref> temporarily cancelled the ships' magnetic signature sufficiently to nullify the threat. This started in late 1939, and by 1940 merchant vessels and the smaller British warships were largely immune for a few months at a time until they once again built up a field.\n\nThe cruiser [[HMS Belfast]] is just one example of a ship which was struck by a magnetic mine during this time. On the 21st November 1939, a mine broke her keel which damaged her engine and boiler rooms, as well as injuring 46 men with one man later dying from his injuries. She was towed to Rosyth for repairs. Incidents like this, resulted in many of the boats that sailed to [[Dunkirk evacuation|Dunkirk]] being degaussed in a marathon four-day effort by degaussing stations.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|pp=34\u201335}}\n\nThe Allies and Germany deployed acoustic mines in WW II, against which even wooden-[[hull (watercraft)|hull]]ed ships (in particular [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]]s) remained vulnerable.<ref name=\"Parillo, p.200\"/> Japan developed sonic generators to sweep these; the gear was not ready by war's end.<ref name=\"Parillo, p.200\"/> The primary method Japan used was small air-delivered bombs. This was profligate and ineffectual; used against acoustic mines at [[Penang]], 200 bombs were needed to detonate just 13 mines.<ref name=\"Parillo, p.200\"/>\n\nThe Germans developed a pressure-activated mine and planned to deploy it as well, but they saved it for later use when it became clear the British had defeated the magnetic system. The U.S. also deployed these, adding \"counters\" which would allow a variable number of ships to pass unharmed before detonating.<ref name=\"Parillo, p.200\"/> This made them a great deal harder to sweep.<ref name=\"Parillo, p.200\"/> Japan's antiquated sweep methods, lifting mines in nets, accidentally proved useful against these mines; it remained too slow and hazardous to be truly effective, especially in light of the high numbers being laid.<ref name=\"Parillo, p.201\"/>\n\nMining campaigns could have devastating consequences.

They are still used today, as they are extremely low cost compared to any other anti-ship weapon and are effective, both as a psychological weapon and as a method to sink enemy ships. Contact mines need to be touched by the target before they detonate, limiting the damage to the direct effects of the explosion and usually affecting only the vessel that triggers them.\n\nEarly mines had mechanical mechanisms to detonate them, but these were superseded in the 1870s by the \"Hertz horn\" (or \"chemical horn\"), which was found to work reliably even after the mine had been in the sea for several years. The mine's upper half is studded with hollow lead protuberances, each containing a glass vial filled with [[sulfuric acid]]. When a ship's hull crushes the metal horn, it cracks the vial inside it, allowing the acid to run down a tube and into a [[lead\u2013acid battery]] which until then contained no acid electrolyte. This energizes the battery, which detonates the explosive.<ref name=\"hartshorn.us\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hartshorn.us/Navy/navy-mines-01.htm |title=Moored-contact |first=Derick S. |last=Hartshorn |publisher=Mineman Memories |date=2010-04-17 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref>\n\nEarlier forms of the detonator employed a vial of sulfuric acid surrounded by a mixture of [[potassium perchlorate]] and sugar. When the vial was crushed, the acid ignited the perchlorate-sugar mix, and the resulting flame ignited the gunpowder charge.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Russian Rockefellers: the Saga of the Nobel Family and the Russian Oil Industry |last=Tolf |first=Robert W. |year=1982 |publisher=Hoover Institution Press |isbn=978-0-8179-6581-5 |page=[https://archive.org/details/russianrockefell00robe/page/18 18] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/russianrockefell00robe/page/18 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the initial period of World War I, the Royal Navy used contact mines in the English Channel and later in large areas of the North Sea to hinder patrols by German submarines. Later, the American antenna mine was widely used because submarines could be at any depth from the surface to the seabed. This type of mine had a copper wire attached to a buoy that floated above the explosive charge which was weighted to the seabed with a steel cable. If a submarine's steel hull touched the copper wire, the slight voltage change caused by contact between two dissimilar metals was amplified{{clarify|reason=amplified by what?|date=December 2015}} and detonated the explosives.<ref name=\"hartshorn.us\"/>\n\n==== Limpet mines ====\n{{Main|Limpet mine}}\nLimpet mines are a special form of contact mine that are manually attached to the target by magnets and remain in place. They are named because of the similarity to the [[limpet]], a [[mollusk]].\n\n====Moored contact mines====\n[[File:Mine (AWM 304925).jpg|thumb|A German contact mine laid in [[Axis naval activity in Australian waters|Australian waters]] during World War II]]\n\nGenerally, this mine type is set to float just below the surface of the water or as deep as five meters. A steel cable connecting the mine to an anchor on the seabed prevents it from drifting away. The explosive and detonating mechanism is contained in a buoyant metal or plastic shell. The depth below the surface at which the mine floats can be set so that only deep draft vessels such as aircraft carriers, battleships or large cargo ships are at risk, saving the mine from being used on a less valuable target. In [[littoral]] waters it is important to ensure that the mine does not become visible when the sea level falls at low tide, so the cable length is adjusted to take account of tides. During WWII there were mines that could be moored in 300m-deep water.\n\nFloating mines typically have a mass of around 200&nbsp;kg, including 80&nbsp;kg of explosives e.g. [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]], [[Minol (explosive)|minol]] or [[amatol]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://victoriancollections.net.au:8080/items/4f72bb6697f83e03086060cb|title=World War 2 Era Contact Sea Mine - Victorian Collections|website=victoriancollections.net.au|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref>\n\n====== Moored contact mines with plummet ======\n[[File: Legen_einer_Ankertaumine.svg|thumb|Sequence of laying a moored contact mine with a plummet]]\nA special form of moored contact mines are those equipped with a plummet. When the mine is launched (1), the mine with the anchor floats first and the lead plummet sinks from it (2). In doing so, the plummet unwinds a wire, the deep line, which is used to set the depth of the mine below the water surface before it is launched (3). When the deep line has been unwound to a set length, the anchor is flooded and the mine is released from the anchor (4). The anchor begins to sink and the mooring cable unwinds until the plummet reaches the sea floor (5). Due to the decreasing tension on the deep line, the mooring cable is clamped. The anchor sinks further down to the bottom of the sea pulling the mine as deep below the water surface as the deep line has been unwound (6). Thus, even without knowing the exact depth, an exact depth of the mine below the water surface can be set. Limited only by the maximum length of the mooring cable.\n\n==== Drifting contact mines ====\nDrifting mines were occasionally used during World War I and World War II. However, they were more feared than effective. Sometimes floating mines break from their moorings and become drifting mines; modern mines are designed to deactivate in this event. After several years at sea, the deactivation mechanism might not function as intended and the mines may remain live. [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|Admiral Jellicoe]]'s British fleet did not pursue and destroy the outnumbered German High Seas Fleet when it turned away at the [[Battle of Jutland]] because he thought they were leading him into a trap: he believed it possible that the Germans were either leaving floating mines in their wake, or were drawing him towards submarines, although neither of these was the case.\n\nAfter World War I the drifting contact mine was banned, but was occasionally used during World War II. The drifting mines were much harder to remove than tethered mines after the war, and they caused about the same damage to both sides.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.strausscenter.org/hormuz/mines.html|title=Mines \u2013 Hormuz|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nChurchill promoted \"[[Operation Royal Marine]]\" in 1940 and again in 1944 where floating mines were put into the [[Rhine]] in France to float down the river, becoming active after a time calculated to be long enough to reach German territory.\n\n===Remotely controlled mines===\nFrequently used in combination with coastal artillery and hydrophones, [[controlled mines]] (or command detonation mines) can be in place in peacetime, which is a huge advantage in blocking important shipping routes. The mines can usually be turned into \"normal\" mines with a switch (which prevents the enemy from simply capturing the controlling station and deactivating the mines), detonated on a signal or be allowed to detonate on their own. The earliest ones were developed around 1812 by [[Robert Fulton]]. The first remotely controlled mines were moored mines used in the American Civil War, detonated electrically from shore. They were considered superior to contact mines because they did not put friendly shipping at risk.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=19kDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA813&dq=Popular+Science+1933+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&hl=en&ei=sXYNTvyADIGLsAK8pbSRCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q&f=true  \"How Mines Help Guard America's Harbors\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', December 1940</ref> The extensive American fortifications program initiated by the [[Board of Fortifications]] in 1885 included [[Submarine mines in United States harbor defense|remotely controlled mines]], which were emplaced or in reserve from the 1890s through the end of World War II.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Berhow | first1 = Mark A., Ed. | last2 = | first2 = | title = American Seacoast Defenses, A Reference Guide, Third Edition | publisher = CDSG Press | year = 2015 | pages = 333\u2013374 | isbn = 978-0-9748167-3-9}}</ref>\n\nModern examples usually weigh {{convert|200|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, including {{convert|80|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of explosives (TNT or hexatonal).{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n===Influence mines===\n[[File:Luftmine (LM).jpg|thumb|upright|German parachute-retarded magnetic mine. Dropped by [[Luftwaffe]] bomber during WWII and landed on the ground. Fuse mechanisms are visible]]\nThese mines are triggered by the influence of a ship or submarine, rather than direct contact. Such mines incorporate [[Electronics|electronic]] sensors designed to detect the presence of a vessel and [[detonate]] when it comes within the [[explosion|blast]] range of the [[warhead]]. The fuses on such mines may incorporate one or more of the following sensors: [[magnetic]], passive [[Acoustic signature|acoustic]] or water [[pressure]] displacement caused by the proximity of a vessel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/man/dod-101/navy/docs/swos/cmd/miw/Sp6-4-1/sld001.htm |title=Title Slide |last=Garrold |first=Tim |work=Mine Warfare Introduction: The Threat |publisher=Surface Warfare Officers School Command, U.S. Navy |date=December 1998 |accessdate=2011-12-31}} Slide 1 of 81. Hosted by Federation of American Scientists.</ref>\n\nFirst used during WWI, their use became more general in WWII. The sophistication of influence mine fuses has increased considerably over the years as first [[transistor]]s and then [[microprocessor]]s have been incorporated into designs. Simple magnetic sensors have been superseded by total-field [[magnetometer]]s. Whereas early magnetic mine fuses would respond only to changes in a single component of a target vessel's magnetic field, a total field magnetometer responds to changes in the magnitude of the total background field (thus enabling it to better detect even degaussed ships). Similarly, the original broadband [[hydrophone]]s of 1940s acoustic mines (which operate on the integrated volume of all frequencies) have been replaced by narrow-band sensors which are much more sensitive and selective. Mines can now be programmed to listen for highly specific [[acoustic signature]]s (e.g. a [[gas turbine]] powerplant or [[cavitation]] sounds from a particular design of [[Screw propeller|propeller]]) and ignore all others. The sophistication of modern electronic mine fuzes incorporating these [[digital signal processing]] capabilities makes it much more difficult to detonate the mine with [[electronic countermeasures]] because several sensors working together (e.g. magnetic, passive acoustic and water pressure) allow it to ignore signals which are not recognised as being the unique signature of an intended target vessel.<ref name=\"fas.org\">{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/man/dod-101/navy/docs/swos/cmd/miw/Sp6-4-1/sld017.htm |title=World War II |last=Garrold |first=Tim |work=Mine Warfare Introduction: The Threat |publisher=Surface Warfare Officers School Command, U.S. Navy |date=December 1998 |accessdate=2011-12-31}} Slide 17 of 81. Hosted by Federation of American Scientists.</ref>\n\nModern influence mines such as the [[Stonefish (mine)|BAE Stonefish]] are [[embedded computer system|computerised]], with all the programmability this implies, such as the ability to quickly load new [[acoustic signature]]s into fuses, or program them to detect a single, highly distinctive target signature. In this way, a mine with a passive acoustic fuze can be programmed to ignore all friendly vessels and small enemy vessels, only detonating when a very large enemy target passes over it. Alternatively, the mine can be programmed specifically to ignore all surface vessels regardless of size and exclusively target submarines.\n\nEven as far back as WWII it was possible to incorporate a \"ship counter\" function in mine fuzes. This might set the mine to ignore the first two ships passing over it (which could be minesweepers deliberately trying to trigger mines) but detonate when the third ship passes overhead, which could be a high-value target such as an [[aircraft carrier]] or [[oil tanker]]. Even though modern mines are generally powered by a long life [[lithium battery]], it is important to conserve power because they may need to remain active for months or even years. For this reason, most influence mines are designed to remain in a semi-dormant state until an unpowered (e.g. deflection of a [[mu-metal]] [[magnetic compass|needle]]) or low-powered sensor detects the possible presence of a vessel, at which point the mine fuze powers up fully and the passive acoustic sensors will begin to operate for some minutes. It is possible to program computerised mines to delay activation for days or weeks after being laid. Similarly, they can be programmed to [[self-destruct]] or render themselves safe after a preset period of time. Generally, the more sophisticated the mine design, the more likely it is to have some form of [[anti-handling device]] to hinder clearance by divers or remotely piloted submersibles.<ref name=\"fas.org\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/man/dod-101/navy/docs/swos/cmd/miw/Sp6-4-1/sld031.htm |title=Mechanism |last=Garrold |first=Tim |work=Mine Warfare Introduction: The Threat |publisher=Surface Warfare Officers School Command, U.S. Navy |date=December 1998 |accessdate=2011-12-31}} Slide 31 of 81. Hosted by Federation of American Scientists.</ref>\n\n====Moored mines====\nThe moored mine is the backbone of modern mine systems. They are deployed where water is too deep for bottom mines. They can use several kinds of instruments to detect an enemy, usually a combination of acoustic, magnetic and pressure sensors, or more sophisticated optical shadows or electro potential sensors. These cost many times more than contact mines. Moored mines are effective against most kinds of ships. As they are cheaper than other anti-ship weapons they can be deployed in large numbers, making them useful [[area denial]] or \"channelizing\" weapons.\nMoored mines usually have lifetimes of more than 10 years, and some almost unlimited. These mines usually weigh {{convert|200|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, including {{convert|80|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of explosives ([[RDX]]). In excess of {{convert|150|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of explosives the mine becomes inefficient, as it becomes too large to handle and the extra explosives add little to the mine's effectiveness.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n====Bottom mines====\nBottom mines (sometimes called ground mines) are used when the water is no more than {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} deep or when mining for submarines down to around {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}. They are much harder to detect and sweep, and can carry a much larger warhead than a moored mine. Bottom mines commonly utilize multiple types of sensors, which are less sensitive to sweeping.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/man/dod-101/navy/docs/swos/cmd/miw/Sp6-4-1/sld033.htm|title=Influence Mines |last=Garrold |first=Tim |work=Mine Warfare Introduction: The Threat |publisher=Surface Warfare Officers School Command, U.S. Navy |date=December 1998 |accessdate=2011-12-31}} Slide 33 of 81.

Hosted by Federation of American Scientists.</ref>\n\n===Unusual mines===\nSeveral specialized mines have been developed for other purposes than the common minefield.\n\n====Bouquet mine====\nThe bouquet mine is a single anchor attached to several floating mines. It is designed so that when one mine is swept or detonated, another takes its place. It is a very sensitive construction and lacks reliability.\n\n====Anti-sweep mine====\nThe anti-sweep mine is a very small mine (40&nbsp;kg warhead) with as small a floating device as possible. When the wire of a mine sweep hits the anchor wire of the mine, it drags the anchor wire along with it, pulling the mine down into contact with the sweeping wire. That detonates the mine and cuts the sweeping wire. They are very cheap and usually used in combination with other mines in a minefield to make sweeping more difficult. One type is the Mark 23 used by the United States during World War II.\n\n====Oscillating mine====\nThe mine is hydrostatically controlled to maintain a pre-set depth below the water's surface independently of the rise and fall of the tide.\n\n====Ascending mine====\nThe ascending mine is a floating distance mine that may cut its mooring or in some other way float higher when it detects a target. It lets a single floating mine cover a much larger depth range.\n\n====Homing mines====\n[[File:Mark 60 CAPTOR-DF-ST-90-11649.JPEG|thumb|A CAPTOR mine being loaded onto a [[B-52 Stratofortress]] at [[Loring Air Force Base]]]]These are mines containing a moving weapon as a warhead, either a torpedo or a [[rocket (weapon)|rocket]].\n\n[[Rocket mine]]: a Russian invention, the rocket mine is a bottom distance mine that fires a homing high-speed rocket (not torpedo) upwards towards the target. It is intended to allow a bottom mine to attack surface ships as well as submarines from a greater depth. One type is the [[Te-1 rocket propelled mine]].\n\n[[Torpedo mine]]: the torpedo mine is a self-propelled variety, able to lie in wait for a target and then pursue it e.g. the [[Mark 60 CAPTOR]]. Generally, torpedo mines incorporate [[embedded computer system|computerised]] acoustic and magnetic fuzes. The U.S. Mark 24 \"mine\", code-named [[Mark 24 Mine|Fido]], was actually an [[Anti-submarine warfare|ASW]] [[homing torpedo]]. The mine designation was disinformation to conceal its function.\n\n====Mobile mine====\nThe mine is propelled to its intended position by propulsion equipment such as a torpedo. After reaching its destination, it sinks to the seabed and operates like a standard mine. It differs from the homing mine in that its mobile stage is before it lies in wait, rather than as part of the attacking phase.\n\nOne such design is the Mk 67 submarine launched mobile mine<ref>[https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/weaps/mk-67.htm MK 67 Submarine-Laid Mobile Mine (SLMM)]. Fas.org. Retrieved on 2010-12-02.</ref> (which is based on a [[Mark 37 torpedo]]) are capable of travelling as far as 10 miles through or into a channel, harbor, shallow water area and other zones which would normally be inaccessible to craft laying the device. After reaching the target area they sink to the sea bed and act like conventionally laid influence mines.\n\n====Nuclear mine====\nDuring the Cold War a test was conducted with naval mine fitted with tactical nuclear warheads for the \"Baker\" shot of [[Operation Crossroads]]. This weapon was experimental and never went into production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navalminewarfare.com/ |title=Australian Mine Warfare |first=Cameron |last=Stewart |work=Naval Mine Warfare |publisher=Naval Mine Warfare |date=2011-10-30 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref> There have been some reports that North Korea may be developing a nuclear mine<ref>{{cite web|author=Jon Rabiroff |url=http://www.stripes.com/news/u-s-military-enters-new-generation-of-sea-mine-warfare-1.143170 |title=U.S. military enters new generation of sea mine warfare \u2013 News |publisher=Stripes |date= |accessdate=2013-07-07}}</ref> The [[Seabed Arms Control Treaty]] prohibits the placement of nuclear weapons on the seabed beyond a 12-mile coast zone.\n\n====Daisy-chained mine====\nThis comprises two moored, floating contact mines which are tethered together by a length of steel cable or chain. Typically, each mine is situated approximately {{convert|60|ft|m}} away from its neighbour, and each floats a few metres below the surface of the ocean. When the target ship hits the steel cable, the mines on either side are drawn down the side of the ship's hull, exploding on contact. In this manner it is almost impossible for target ships to pass safely between two individually moored mines. Daisy-chained mines are a very simple concept which was used during World War II.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n====Dummy mine====\nPlastic drums filled with sand or concrete are periodically rolled off the side of ships as real mines are laid in large mine-fields. These inexpensive false targets (designed to be of a similar shape and size as genuine mines) are intended to slow down the process of mine clearance: a mine-hunter is forced to investigate each suspicious sonar contact on the sea bed, whether it is real or not. Often a maker of naval mines will provide both training and dummy versions of their mines.<ref name=\"MN103-MANTA Sea Mines\">{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716034740/http://www.sei-spa.com/mantaing.html |url=http://www.sei-spa.com/mantaing.html |title=MN103-MANTA Sea Mines |publisher=Sei Spa |archivedate=2011-07-16 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref>\n\n== Mine laying ==\n[[File:Mine laying ship Iran Ajr.jpg|thumb|Captured Iranian mine laying ship, ''[[Iran Ajr]]'' (left), a converted Japanese-built landing craft, 1987.]]\n\n[[File:US Navy 030321-N-4655M-029 Coalition Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) team members inspect camouflaged mines hidden inside oil barrels on the deck of an Iraqi shipping barge.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Camouflage]]d Iraqi mines hidden inside [[oil barrel]]s on a shipping barge in the [[Persian Gulf]], 2003.]]\n\nHistorically several methods were used to lay mines. During WWI and WWII, the Germans used [[U-boat]]s to lay mines around the UK. In WWII, aircraft came into favour for mine laying with one of the largest examples being the mining of the Japanese sea routes in [[Operation Starvation]].\n\nLaying a minefield is a relatively fast process with specialized ships, which is today the most common method. These minelayers can carry several thousand mines{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} and manoeuvre with high precision. The mines are dropped at predefined intervals into the water behind the ship. Each mine is recorded for later clearing, but it is not unusual for these records to be lost together with the ships. Therefore, many countries demand that all mining operations be planned on land and records kept so that the mines can later be recovered more easily.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sinodefence.com/navy/support/wolei.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809221420/http://www.sinodefence.com/navy/support/wolei.asp |title=Type 918 (Wolei Class) Minelayer |archivedate=2010-08-09 |work=Naval Forces: Vessels |publisher=SinoDefence.com |date=2008-06-16 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref>\n\nOther methods to lay minefields include:\n\n*Converted merchant ships \u2013 rolled or slid down ramps\n*Aircraft \u2013 descent to the water is slowed by a parachute\n*Submarines \u2013 launched from [[torpedo]] tubes or deployed from specialized mine racks on the sides of the submarine\n*Combat boats \u2013 rolled off the side of the boat\n*Camouflaged boats \u2013 masquerading as fishing boats\n*Dropping from the shore \u2013 typically smaller, shallow-water mines\n*Attack divers \u2013 smaller shallow-water mines\n\nIn some cases, mines are automatically activated upon contact with the water. In others, a safety [[lanyard]] is pulled (one end attached to the rail of a ship, aircraft or torpedo tube) which starts an automatic timer countdown before the arming process is complete. Typically, the automatic safety-arming process takes some minutes to complete. This allows the people laying the mines sufficient time to move out of its activation and blast zones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ordnance.org/Mines.htm |title=Aircraft-Laid Mines |work=Mines |publisher=The Ordnance Shop |accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref>\n\n===Aerial mining in World War II===\n{{also|Parachute mine}}\n====Germany====\nIn the 1930s, Germany had experimented with the laying of mines by aircraft.

In the next 20 months, mines delivered by aircraft sank or damaged 164 Axis ships with the loss of 94 aircraft. By comparison, direct aerial attacks on Axis shipping had sunk or damaged 105 vessels at a cost of 373 aircraft lost. The advantage of aerial mining became clear, and the UK prepared for it.

Johnson, CDR USNR, suggested massive aerial mining operations against Japan's \"outer zone\" (Korea and northern China) as well as the \"inner zone\", their [[Japanese Archipelago|home islands]]. First, aerial mines would have to be developed further and manufactured in large numbers. Second, laying the mines would require a sizable air group. The [[US Army Air Forces]] had the carrying capacity but considered mining to be the navy's job. The US Navy lacked suitable aircraft. Johnson set about convincing General [[Curtis LeMay]] of the efficacy of heavy bombers laying aerial mines.<ref>{{cite book |title=Spying Without Spies: Origins of America's Secret Nuclear Surveillance System |last=Ziegler |first=Charles A. |year=1995 |publisher=Praeger |isbn=0-275-95049-2 |page=118 }}</ref>\n\n[[B-24 Liberator]]s, [[PBY Catalina]]s and other bomber aircraft took part in localized mining operations in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|Southwest Pacific]] and the [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|China Burma India (CBI)]] theaters, beginning with a successful attack on the [[Yangon River]] in February 1943. Aerial minelaying operations involved a coalition of British, Australian and American aircrews, with the RAF and the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) carrying out 60% of the sorties and the USAAF and US Navy covering 40%. Both British and American mines were used. Japanese merchant shipping suffered tremendous losses, while Japanese mine sweeping forces were spread too thin attending to far-flung ports and extensive coastlines. Admiral [[Thomas C. Kinkaid]], who directed nearly all RAAF mining operations in CBI, heartily endorsed aerial mining, writing in July 1944 that \"aerial mining operations were of the order of 100 times as destructive to the enemy as an equal number of bombing missions against land targets.\"<ref name=\"Diane\"/>\n\nA single B-24 dropped three mines into [[Haiphong]] harbor in October 1943. One of those mines sank a Japanese freighter. Another B-24 dropped three more mines into the harbor in November, and a second freighter was sunk by a mine. The threat of the remaining mines prevented a convoy of ten ships from entering Haiphong; and six of those ships were sunk by attacks before they reached a safe harbor.

Advancing military forces worked to clear mines from newly-taken areas, but extensive minefields remained in place after the war. Air-dropped mines had an additional problem for mine sweeping operations: they were not meticulously charted. In Japan, much of the B-29 mine-laying work had been performed at high altitude, with the drifting on the wind of mines carried by parachute adding a randomizing factor to their placement. Generalized danger areas were identified, with only the quantity of mines given in detail. Mines used in Operation Starvation were supposed to be self-sterilizing, but the circuit did not always work. Clearing the mines from Japanese waters took so many years that the task was eventually given to the [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Development of Mine Warfare: A Most Murderous and Barbarous Conduct |last=Youngblood |first=Norman |year=2006 |publisher=Greenwood |isbn=0-275-98419-2 |page=141 }}</ref>\n\nFor the purpose of clearing all types of naval mines, the Royal Navy employed German crews and minesweepers from June 1945 to January 1948,<ref>[http://www.janmaat.de/m_gesch0.htm German Mine Sweeping Administration (GMSA)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420121039/http://www.janmaat.de/m_gesch0.htm |date=2008-04-20 }} (in German), accessed: 9 June 2008</ref> organised in the [[German Mine Sweeping Administration]] (GMSA), which consisted of 27,000 members of the former ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' and 300 vessels.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8Uczn3-3F34C&pg=PA41&lpg=PA41 Google book review: ''German Seaman 1939\u201345''] Page: 41, author: Gordon Williamson, John White, publisher: Osprey Publishing, accessed: 9 July 2008</ref> Mine clearing was not always successful: a number of ships were damaged or sunk by mines after the war.

(Elphick, p. 402.)</ref>\n\n==Damage==\n\nThe damage that may be caused by a mine depends on the \"[[shock factor]] value\", a combination of the initial strength of the explosion and of the distance between the target and the detonation. When taken in reference to ship hull plating, the term \"Hull Shock Factor\" (HSF) is used, while keel damage is termed \"Keel Shock Factor\" (KSF). If the explosion is directly underneath the keel, then HSF is equal to KSF, but explosions that are not directly underneath the ship will have a lower value of KSF.<ref name=Reid1996/>\n\n===Direct damage===\nUsually only created by contact mines, direct damage is a hole blown in the ship. Among the crew, [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]] wounds are the most common form of damage. Flooding typically occurs in one or two main watertight compartments, which can sink smaller ships or disable larger ones. Contact mine damage often occurs at or close to the waterline near the bow,<ref name=Reid1996/> but depending on circumstances a ship could be hit anywhere on its outer hull surface (the {{USS|Samuel B. Roberts|FFG-58|6}} mine attack being a good example of a contact mine detonating amidships and underneath the ship).\n\n===Bubble jet effect===\nThe bubble jet effect occurs when a mine or torpedo detonates in the water a short distance away from the targeted ship. The explosion creates a bubble in the water, and due to the difference in pressure, the bubble will collapse from the bottom. The bubble is buoyant, and so it rises towards the surface. If the bubble reaches the surface as it collapses, it can create a pillar of water that can go over a hundred meters into the air (a \"columnar plume\"). If conditions are right and the bubble collapses onto the ship's hull, the damage to the ship can be extremely serious; the collapsing bubble forms a high-energy jet similar to [[shaped charge]] can break a metre-wide hole straight through the ship, flooding one or more compartments, and is capable of breaking smaller ships apart. The crew in the areas hit by the pillar are usually killed instantly. Other damage is usually limited.<ref name=Reid1996/>\n\nThe [[Baengnyeong incident]], in which the [[ROKS Cheonan (PCC-772)|ROKS ''Cheonan'']] broke in half and sank off the coast South Korea in 2010, was caused by the bubble jet effect, according to an international investigation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/20_05_10jigreport.pdf |title=Investigation Result on the Sinking of ROKS \"Cheonan\" by The Joint Civilian-Military Investigation Group|date=20 May 2010 |accessdate=27 January 2014|work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/26/world/asia/26korea.html |title=South Korea Cites Attack in Ship Sinking|newspaper=The New York Times|date=25 April 2010 |accessdate=25 April 2010 | first=Choe | last=Sang-Hun}}</ref>\n\n===Shock effect===\nIf the mine detonates at a distance from the ship, the change in water pressure causes the ship to resonate.

In this field the British, with their large seagoing navy, have had the bulk of world experience, and most anti-mine developments, such as [[degaussing]] and the double-L sweep, were British inventions. When on operational missions, such as the recent invasion of Iraq, the US still relies on British and Canadian minesweeping services. The US has worked on some innovative mine-hunting countermeasures, such as the use of [[military dolphin]]s to detect and flag mines. However, they are of questionable effectiveness.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Mines in nearshore environments remain a particular challenge. They are small and as technology has developed they can have anechoic coatings, be non-metallic, and oddly shaped to resist detection.<ref name=\"minewar\">Oceanography and Mine Warfare. Ocean Studies Board, National Research Council {{ISBN|0-309-51587-4}}</ref>{{rp|18}} Further, oceanic conditions and the sea bottoms of the area of operations can degrade sweeping and hunting efforts.<ref name=\"minewar\" />{{rp|18}} Mining countermeasures are far more expensive and time-consuming than mining operations, and that gap is only growing with new technologies.<ref name=\"minewar\" />{{rp|18}}\n\n=== Passive countermeasures ===\nShips can be designed to be difficult for mines to detect, to avoid detonating them. This is especially true for minesweepers and mine hunters that work in minefields, where a minimal signature outweighs the need for armour and speed. These ships have hulls of glass fibre or wood instead of steel to avoid magnetic signatures. These ships may use special propulsion systems, with [[low magnetic electric motor]]s, to reduce magnetic signature, and [[Voith-Schneider]] propellers, to limit the [[acoustic signature]]. They are built with hulls that produce a minimal pressure signature. These measures create other problems. They are expensive, slow, and vulnerable to enemy fire. Many modern ships have a mine-warning [[sonar]]\u2014a simple sonar looking forward and warning the crew if it detects possible mines ahead. It is only effective when the ship is moving slowly.<br/> <small>(See also [[SQQ-32 Mine-hunting sonar]])</small>\n\nA steel-hulled ship can be ''[[Degaussing|degaussed]]'' (more correctly, de-oerstedted or [[deperming|depermed]]) using a special degaussing station that contains many large coils and induces a magnetic field in the hull with alternating current to demagnetize the hull. This is a rather problematic solution, as magnetic compasses need recalibration and all metal objects must be kept in exactly the same place. Ships slowly regain their magnetic field as they travel through the Earth's magnetic field, so the process has to be repeated every six months.<ref>https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/weaps/degaussing.htm</ref>\n\nA simpler variation of this technique, called ''wiping'', was developed by [[Charles F. Goodeve]] which saved time and resources.\n\nBetween 1941 and 1943 the US Naval Gun factory (a division of the Naval Ordnance Laboratory) in Washington, D.C., built physical models of all US naval ships. Three kinds of steel were used in shipbuilding: mild steel for bulkheads, a mixture of mild steel and high tensile steel for the hull, and special treatment steel for armor plate. The models were placed within coils which could simulate the Earth's magnetic field at any location. The magnetic signatures were measured with degaussing coils. The objective was to reduce the vertical component of the combination of the Earth's field and the ship's field at the usual depth of German mines. From the measurements, coils were placed and coil currents determined to minimize the chance of detonation for any ship at any heading at any latitude.<ref name=\"eaglespeak.us\">{{cite web|first=Mark |last=Tempest |url=http://www.eaglespeak.us/2007/11/sunday-ship-history-degaussing-ships.html |title=Sunday Ship History: Degaussing Ships |work=EagleSpeak |publisher=Eaglespeak.us |date=2007-11-04 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref>\n\nSome ships are built with magnetic [[inductor]]s, large coils placed along the ship to counter the ship's magnetic field. Using magnetic probes in strategic parts of the ship, the strength of the current in the coils can be adjusted to minimize the total magnetic field. This is a heavy and clumsy solution, suited only to small-to-medium-sized ships. Boats typically lack the generators and space for the solution, while the amount of power needed to overcome the magnetic field of a large ship is impractical.<ref name=\"eaglespeak.us\"/>\n\n=== Active countermeasures ===\nActive countermeasures are ways to clear a path through a minefield or remove it completely. This is one of the most important tasks of any mine warfare flotilla.\n\n[[File:MH-53E Sea Dragon towing sled.jpg|thumb|An [[CH-53E Super Stallion|MH-53E]] from [[HM-15]] tows a minesweeping sled while conducting simulated mine clearing operations]]\n[[File:USS Tide sinking.jpg|thumb|Minesweeper {{USS|Tide|AM-125|6}} after striking a mine off [[Utah Beach]], 7 June 1944. Note her broken back, with smoke pouring from amidships.]]\n\n==== Mine sweeping ====\n{{main|Minesweeping}}\nA sweep is either a contact sweep, a wire dragged through the water by one or two ships to cut the mooring wire of floating mines, or a distance sweep that mimics a ship to detonate the mines. The sweeps are dragged by [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]]s, either purpose-built military ships or converted [[Commercial trawler|trawlers]]. Each run covers between one and two hundred meters, and the ships must move slowly in a straight line, making them vulnerable to enemy fire. This was exploited by the Turkish army in the [[Battle of Gallipoli]] in 1915, when mobile [[howitzer]] batteries prevented the British and French from clearing a way through minefields.\n\nIf a contact sweep hits a mine, the wire of the sweep rubs against the mooring wire until it is cut. Sometimes \"cutters\", explosive devices to cut the mine's wire, are used to lessen the strain on the sweeping wire. Mines cut free are recorded and collected for research or shot with a deck gun.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ussimplicitmso-455.com/Minesweeping.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402163450/http://www.ussimplicitmso-455.com/Minesweeping.html |archivedate=2009-04-02 |title=Mine Sweeping Operations |work=Minesweeping |publisher=Charles Lees |accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref>\n\nMinesweepers protect themselves with an [[Oropesa (minesweeping)|oropesa]] or [[Paravane (weapon)|paravane]] instead of a second minesweeper. These are torpedo-shaped towed bodies, similar in shape to a Harvey Torpedo, that are streamed from the sweeping vessel thus keeping the sweep at a determined depth and position. Some large warships were routinely equipped with paravane sweeps near the bows in case they inadvertently sailed into minefields\u2014the mine would be deflected towards the paravane by the wire instead of towards the ship by its wake. More recently, heavy-lift helicopters have dragged minesweeping sleds, as in the 1991 Persian Gulf War.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/paravane |title=Paravane \u2013 Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref>\n\nThe distance sweep mimics the sound and magnetism of a ship and is pulled behind the sweeper. It has floating coils and large underwater ''drums''. It is the only sweep effective against bottom mines.\n\nDuring WWII, [[RAF Coastal Command]] used [[Vickers Wellington]] bombers Wellington DW.Mk I fitted with degaussing coils to trigger magnetic mines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwiivehicles.com/unitedkingdom/aircraft/bomber/vickers-wellington.asp |title=Britain's Vickers Wellington bomber, 'Wimpey' |work=World War II Vehicles, Tanks, and Airplanes |publisher=Wwiivehicles.com |accessdate=2011-12-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118105920/http://www.wwiivehicles.com/unitedkingdom/aircraft/bomber/vickers-wellington.asp |archive-date=2011-11-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nModern influence mines are designed to discriminate against false inputs and are, therefore, much harder to sweep. They often contain inherent anti-sweeping mechanisms. For example, they may be programmed to respond to the unique noise of a particular ship-type, its associated magnetic signature and the typical pressure displacement of such a vessel. As a result, a mine-sweeper must accurately mimic the required target signature to trigger detonation. The task is complicated by the fact that an influence mine may have one or more of a hundred different potential target signatures programmed into it.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/man/dod-101/navy/docs/swos/cmd/miw/Sp6-4-1/sld034.htm |title=Mine Counter-Counter Measures (MCCM) |last=Garrold |first=Tim |work=Mine Warfare Introduction: The Threat |publisher=Surface Warfare Officers School Command, U.S. Navy |date=December 1998 |accessdate=2011-12-31}} Slide 34 of 81. Hosted by Federation of American Scientists.</ref>\n\nAnother anti-sweeping mechanism is a ship-counter in the mine fuze. When enabled, this allows detonation only after the mine [[fuze]] has been triggered a pre-set number of times. To further complicate matters, influence mines may be programmed to arm themselves (or disarm automatically\u2014known as ''self-sterilization'') after a pre-set time. During the pre-set arming delay (which could last days or even weeks) the mine would remain dormant and ignore any target stimulus, whether genuine or false.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nWhen influence mines are laid in an ocean minefield, they may have various combinations of fuze settings configured. For example, some mines (with the acoustic sensor enabled) may become active within three hours of being laid, others (with the acoustic and magnetic sensors enabled) may become active after two weeks but have the ship-counter mechanism set to ignore the first two trigger events, and still others in the same minefield (with the magnetic and pressure sensors enabled) may not become armed until three weeks have passed. Groups of mines within this mine-field may have different target signatures which may or may not overlap. The fuzes on influence mines allow many different permutations, which complicates the clearance process.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nMines with ship-counters, arming delays and highly specific target signatures in mine fuzes can falsely convince a belligerent that a particular area is clear of mines or has been swept effectively because a succession of vessels have already passed through safely.\n\n[[File:Minenjagddrohne Pinguin.jpg|thumb|left|''Pinguin B3'' mine hunting drone, such are operated from {{sclass-|Frankenthal|minehunter|1}}s of the [[German Navy]]]]\n\n==== Mine hunting ====\nAs naval mines have become more sophisticated, and able to discriminate between targets, so they have become more difficult to deal with by conventional sweeping. This has given rise to the practice of mine-hunting.\nMine hunting is very different from sweeping, although some [[minehunter]]s can do both tasks. Minehunting pays little attention to the nature of the mine itself. Nor does the method change much. At the current state of the art, Minehunting remains the best way to deal with influence mines proving to be both safer and more effective than sweeping. Specialized high-frequency sonars and high fidelity sidescaning sonar are used for mine location.<ref name=\"minewar\" />{{rp|18}}  Mines are hunted using sonar, then inspected and destroyed either by divers or [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]]s (remote controlled unmanned mini-submarines). It is slow, but also the most reliable way to remove mines. Minehunting started during the Second World War, but it was only after the war that it became truly effective.\n\nSea mammals (mainly the [[bottlenose dolphin]]) have been trained to hunt and mark mines, most famously by the [[U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program]]. Mine-clearance dolphins were deployed in the [[Persian Gulf]] during the [[Iraq War]] in 2003. The US Navy claims that these dolphins were effective in helping to clear more than 100 antiship mines and underwater [[booby trap]]s from [[Umm Qasr Port]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/issues/2003/september/phenomena.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070901162827/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/issues/2003/september/phenomena.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-09-01 |title=Uncle Sam's Dolphins |work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian Magazine]] |date=September 2003 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref>\n\nFrench naval officer [[Jacques Yves Cousteau]]'s Undersea Research Group was once involved in mine-hunting operations: They removed or detonated a variety of German mines, but one particularly defusion-resistant batch\u2014equipped with acutely sensitive pressure, magnetic, and acoustic sensors and wired together so that one explosion would trigger the rest\u2014was simply left undisturbed for years until corrosion would (hopefully) disable the mines.<ref>Cousteau, Jacques Yves.

An early example of this was [[David Farragut|Farragut's]] [[Battle of Mobile Bay|actions at Mobile Bay]] during the [[American Civil War]]. However, as mine warfare became more developed this method became uneconomical.\nThis method was revived by the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' during WWII. Left with a surfeit of idle ships due to the [[Blockade of Germany (1939\u201345)|Allied blockade]], the ''Kriegsmarine'' introduced a ship known as ''[[Sperrbrecher]]'' (\"block breaker\"). Typically an old cargo ship, loaded with cargo that made her less vulnerable to sinking (wood for example), the ''Sperrbrecher'' was run ahead of the ship to be protected, detonating any mines that might be in their path. The use of ''Sperrbrecher'' obviated the need to continuous and painstaking sweeping, but the cost was high. Over half the 100 or so ships used as ''Sperrbrecher'' were sunk during the war. Alternatively, a shallow draught vessel can be steamed through the minefield at high speed to generate a pressure wave sufficient to trigger mines, with the minesweeper moving fast enough to be sufficiently clear of the pressure wave so that triggered mines do not destroy the ship itself. These techniques are the only publicly known to be employed way to sweep pressure mines. The technique can be simply countered by use of a ship-counter, set to allow a certain number of passes before the mine is actually triggered. Modern doctrine calls for ground mines to be hunted rather than swept. A new system is being introduced for sweeping pressure mines, however counters are going to remain a problem.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navysbir.com/n07_s/navst07-030.htm |title=Influence Sweeping of Pressure Mines |publisher=U.S. Navy Small Business Innovation Research |date=2007-03-21 |accessdate=2011-12-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308200055/https://www.navysbir.com/n07_s/navst07-030.htm |archivedate=2012-03-08 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-Underwater-Warfare-Systems/Pressure-sweep-Sweden.html |title=Pressure sweep (Sweden) |work=Jane's Underwater Warfare Systems |publisher=Janes.com |date=2011-09-08 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref>\n\nAn updated form of this method is the use of small unmanned [[Remotely operated vehicle|ROV]]s (such as the [[Ensdorf class minesweeper|''Seehund'']] drone) that simulate the acoustic and magnetic signatures of larger ships and are built to survive exploding mines. Repeated sweeps would be required in case one or more of the mines had its \"ship counter\" facility enabled i.e. were programmed to ignore the first 2, 3, or even 6 target activations.\n\n== National arsenals ==\n\n===US mines===\nThe [[United States Navy]] [[MK56 ASW mine]] (the oldest still in use by the United States) was developed in 1966. More advanced mines include the [[CAPTOR mine|MK60 CAPTOR]] (short for \"encapsulated torpedo\"), the MK62 and MK63 Quickstrike and the MK67 SLMM (Submarine Launched Mobile Mine). Today, most U.S. naval mines are delivered by aircraft.\n\n<big>'''MK67 SLMM Submarine Launched Mobile Mine'''</big><br/>\nThe SLMM was developed by the United States as a submarine deployed mine for use in areas inaccessible for other mine deployment techniques or for covert mining of hostile environments.

The MK65 is a 2,000-lb (900&nbsp;kg) dedicated, purpose-built mine. However, other Quickstrike versions (MK62, MK63, and MK64) are converted general-purpose bombs. These latter three mines are actually a single type of electronic [[fuze]] fitted to [[Mk82]], [[Mk83]] and [[Mk84]] air-dropped bombs. Because this latter type of Quickstrike fuze only takes up a small amount of storage space compared to a dedicated sea mine, the air-dropped bomb casings have dual purpose i.e. can be fitted with conventional contact fuzes and dropped on land targets, or have a Quickstrike fuze fitted which converts them into sea mines.\n\n'''General characteristics'''\n\n* Type: aircraft-laid bottom mine (with descent to water slowed by a parachute or other mechanism)\n* Detection System: <nowiki>Magnetic/seismic/pressure target detection devices (TDDs)</nowiki>\n* Dimensions: {{convert|0.74|by|3.25|m|in|abbr=on}}\n* Depth Range: Shallow water\n* Weight: {{convert|1086|kg|lb|abbr=on}}\n* Explosives: Various loads\n* Date Deployed: 1983\n\n<big>'''MK56'''</big><br/>\n'''General characteristics'''\n\n* Type: Aircraft laid moored mine\n* Detection System: Total field magnetic exploder\n* Dimensions: {{convert|0.570|by|2.9|m|in|abbr=on}}{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n* Depth Range: Moderate depths\n* Weight: {{convert|909|kg|lb|abbr=on}}\n* Explosives: {{convert|164|kg|lb|abbr=on}} HBX-3\n* Date Deployed: 1966\n\n===Royal Navy===\nAccording to a statement made to the UK Parliament in 2002:<ref>{{cite web |title=Hansard Written Answers |date=4 November 2002 |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo021104/text/21104w16.htm |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>...the Royal Navy does not have any mine stocks and has not had since 1992.

Mines are relatively cheap and being small allows them to be easily deployed. Indeed, with some kinds of mines, trucks and rafts will suffice. At present there are more than 300 different mines available. Some 50 countries currently have mining ability. The number of naval mine producing countries has increased by 75% since 1988. It is also noted that these mines are of an increasing sophistication while even the older type mines present a significant problem. It has been noted that mine warfare may become an issue with terrorist organizations. Mining busy shipping straits and mining shipping harbors remain some of the most serious threats.<ref name=\"minewar\" />{{rp|9}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bomb disposal]]\n* {{ship|HMHS|Britannic}}\n* [[Corfu Channel case]]\n* [[Land mine]]\n* [[Minesweeper]]\n* [[Minelayer]]\n* [[Admiralty Mining Establishment|Royal Navy's Admiralty Mining Establishment]]\n* [[Royal Naval Patrol Service]]\n* [[Shock factor]]\n* [[Mine planter (vessel)]]\n* [[Singer (naval mine)]]\n* [[Submarine mines in United States harbor defense]]\n* [[Stonefish (mine)|Stonefish influence mine]]\n* [[Operation Pocket Money]] (aerial mining campaign against North Vietnam in 1972)\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n*{{PD-old-text|title=Publication, Issue 33 Document (United States.

Unlike [[depth charge]]s, mines are deposited and left to wait until they are triggered by the approach of, or contact with, any vessel. Naval mines can be used offensively, to hamper enemy shipping movements or lock vessels into a [[harbour]]; or defensively, to protect friendly vessels and create \"safe\" zones. Mines allow the minelaying force commander to concentrate warships or defensive assets in mine-free areas giving the adversary three choices: undertake an expensive and time-consuming minesweeping effort, accept the casualties of challenging the minefield, or use the unmined waters where the greatest concentration of enemy firepower will be encountered.<ref>{{cite journal |last=McDonald |first=Wesley |authorlink =Wesley L.

Mines may be placed by aircraft, ships, submarines, or individual swimmers and boatmen. Although international law requires signatory nations to declare mined areas, precise locations remain secret; and non-complying individuals may not disclose minelaying. While mines threaten only those who choose to traverse waters which may be mined, the possibility of activating a mine is a powerful disincentive to shipping.\n\n\n==Description==\nMines can be laid in many ways: by purpose-built [[minelayer]]s, refitted ships, submarines or [[aircraft]]\u2014and even by dropping them into a [[harbour]] by hand. They can be inexpensive: some variants can cost as little as US$2000, though more sophisticated mines can cost millions of dollars, be equipped with several kinds of sensors and deliver a [[warhead]] by [[rocket]] or [[torpedo]].\n\n[[File:British Mk 14 Sea Mine.jpg|thumb|upright|British Mk 14 sea mine]]\n\nTheir flexibility and cost-effectiveness make mines attractive to the less powerful belligerent in [[asymmetric warfare]]. The cost of producing and laying a mine is usually between 0.5% and 10% of the cost of removing it, and it can take up to 200 times as long to clear a minefield as to lay it. Parts of some [[World War II]] naval minefields still exist because they are too extensive and expensive to clear.<ref>{{Citation | author = Paul O'Mahony   | title = Swedish navy locates German WWII mines | newspaper = The Local Europe AB | page =   |  date = 16 June 2009 | url = http://www.thelocal.se/20090616/20102 | accessdate = 8 March 2016}}</ref> Some 1940s-era mines may remain dangerous for many years.\n\nMines have been employed as offensive or defensive weapons in rivers, lakes, estuaries, seas and oceans, but they can also be used as tools of [[psychological warfare]].<!--Tom Clancy once wrote (in ''Submarine'', IIRC), it doesn't take actual mines to make a minefield, just a press release: just because minesweepers don't find any doesn't mean there aren't any...--> Offensive mines are placed in enemy waters, outside harbours and across important shipping routes to sink both merchant and military vessels. Defensive minefields safeguard key stretches of coast from enemy ships and submarines, forcing them into more easily defended areas, or keeping them away from sensitive ones.\n\nShip owners are reluctant to send their ships though known minefields. Port authorities may attempt to clear a mined area, but those without effective minesweeping equipment may cease using the area. Transit of a mined area will be attempted only when strategic interests outweigh potential losses. The decision-maker's perception of the minefield is a critical factor. Minefields designed for psychological effect are usually placed on [[trade route]]s to stop ships from reaching an enemy nation. They are often spread thinly, to create an impression of minefields existing across large areas. A single mine inserted strategically on a shipping route can stop maritime movements for days while the entire area is swept. A mine's capability to sink ships makes it a credible threat, but minefields work more on the mind than on ships.<ref name=G&B/>\n\n[[International law]], specifically the Eighth [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907#Hague Convention of 1907|Hague Convention of 1907]], requires nations to declare when they mine an area, to make it easier for civil shipping to avoid the mines.

A cable connected it to a [[galvanic cell]] which powered it from the shore, the power of its explosive charge was equal to {{convert|14|kg}} of [[black powder]]. In the summer of 1853, the production of the mine was approved by the Committee for Mines of the [[Ministry of War of the Russian Empire]]. In 1854, 60 Jacobi mines were laid in the vicinity of the Forts Pavel and [[Fort Alexander (Saint Petersburg)|Alexander]] ([[Kronstadt]]), to deter the [[British Baltic Fleet]] from attacking them. It gradually phased out its direct competitor the [[Nobel mine]] on the insistence of Admiral [[Fyodor Litke]]. The Nobel mines were bought from Swedish industrialist [[Immanuel Nobel]] who had entered into [[collusion]] with Russian head of navy [[Alexander Sergeyevich Menshikov]]. Despite their high cost (100 [[Russian ruble]]s) the Nobel mines proved to be faulty, exploding while being laid, failing to explode or detaching from their wires and drifting uncontrollably, at least 70 of them were subsequently disarmed by the British. In 1855, 301 more Jacobi mines were laid around Krostadt and [[Lisy Nos]]. British ships did not dare to approach them.{{sfn|Tarle|1944|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nIn the 19th century, mines were called [[torpedo]]es, a name probably conferred by [[Robert Fulton]] after the [[torpedo fish]], which gives powerful [[electric shock]]s. A [[spar torpedo]] was a mine attached to a long pole and detonated when the ship carrying it rammed another one and withdrew a safe distance. The submarine {{ship||H. L. Hunley|submarine|2}} used one to sink {{USS|Housatonic|1861|6}} on 17 February 1864. A [[Harvey torpedo]] was a type of floating mine towed alongside a ship and was briefly in service in the [[Royal Navy]] in the 1870s. Other \"torpedoes\" were attached to ships or propelled themselves. One such weapon called the [[Whitehead torpedo]] after its inventor, caused the word \"torpedo\" to apply to self-propelled underwater missiles as well as to static devices. These mobile devices were also known as \"fish torpedoes\".\n\nThe [[American Civil War]] of 1861\u20131865 also saw the successful use of mines. The first ship sunk by a mine, {{USS|Cairo}}, foundered in 1862 in the [[Yazoo River]]. [[Rear Admiral]] [[David Farragut]]'s famous/apocryphal command during the [[Battle of Mobile Bay]] in 1864, \"[[Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!]]\" refers to a minefield laid at [[Mobile, Alabama]].\n\nAfter 1865 the United States adopted the mine as its primary weapon for [[Seacoast defense in the United States|coastal defense]]. In the decade following 1868, Major [[Henry Larcom Abbot]] carried out a lengthy set of experiments to design and test [[Submarine mines in United States harbor defense|moored mines]] that could be exploded on contact or be detonated at will as enemy shipping passed near them. This initial development of mines in the United States took place under the purview of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], which trained officers and men in their use at the [[U.S. Army Engineer School|Engineer School of Application]] at Willets Point, New York (later named [[Fort Totten (Queens)|Fort Totten]]). In 1901 underwater minefields became the responsibility of the US Army's Artillery Corps, and in 1907 this was a founding responsibility of the [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdsg.org/coast-artillery-submarine-mine-defenses/|title=Coast Artillery: Submarine Mine Defenses|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Imperial Russian Navy]], a pioneer in mine warfare, successfully deployed mines against the [[Ottoman Navy]] during both the Crimean War and the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878)]].<ref name= Kowner>{{cite book | last = Kowner| first = Rotem|authorlink=Rotem Kowner| year = 2006 | title = Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War | publisher = The Scarecrow Press | location = |isbn=0-8108-4927-5 }} page 238.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Tamsui]] (1884), in the [[Keelung Campaign]] of the [[Sino-French War]], Chinese forces in Taiwan under [[Liu Mingchuan]] took measures to reinforce [[Tamsui]] against the French; they planted nine torpedo mines in the river and blocked the entrance.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|title=Maritime Taiwan: Historical Encounters with the East and the West\n|issue=|first=Shih-shan Henry|last=Tsai\n|edition=illustrated|year=2009|publisher=M.E.

Two mines blew up when the {{ship|Russian battleship|Petropavlovsk|1894|2}} struck them near [[Port Arthur naval base|Port Arthur]], sending the holed vessel to the bottom and killing the fleet commander, Admiral [[Stepan Makarov]], and most of his crew in the process. The toll inflicted by mines was not confined to the Russians, however. The [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Navy]] lost two battleships, four cruisers, two destroyers and a torpedo-boat to offensively laid mines during the war. Most famously, on May 15, 1904, the Russian [[minelayer]] [[Amur-class minelayer (1898)|''Amur'']] planted a 50-mine minefield off [[L\u00fcshunkou District|Port Arthur]] and succeeded in sinking the Japanese battleships {{ship|Japanese battleship|Hatsuse||2}} and {{ship|Japanese battleship|Yashima||2}}.\n\nFollowing the end of the Russo-Japanese War, several nations attempted to have mines banned as weapons of war at the [[Hague Peace Conference (1907)]].<ref name= Kowner/>\n\nMany early mines were fragile and dangerous to handle, as they contained glass containers filled with [[nitroglycerin]] or mechanical devices that activated a blast upon tipping. Several mine-laying ships were destroyed when their cargo exploded.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwideinvention.com/articles/details/312/naval-mine-contained-explosive-device-placed-in-water-to-destroy-ships-or-submarines.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103144718/http://www.worldwideinvention.com/articles/details/312/Naval-mine-contained-explosive-device-placed-in-water-to-destroy-ships-or-submarines.html |archivedate=2013-11-03 }}</ref>\n\nBeginning around the start of the 20th century, submarine mines played a major role in the [[Submarine mines in United States harbor defense|defense of U.S. harbors]] against enemy attack as part of the [[Board of Fortifications|Endicott and Taft Programs]]. The mines employed were controlled mines, anchored to the bottoms of the harbors and detonated under control from large mine [[casemate]]s on shore.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], mines were used extensively to defend coasts, coastal shipping, ports and naval bases around the globe. The Germans laid mines in shipping lanes to sink merchant and naval vessels serving Britain. The Allies targeted the German U-boats in the Strait of Dover and the Hebrides. In an attempt to seal up the northern exits of the North Sea, the Allies developed the [[North Sea Mine Barrage]]. During a period of five months from June 1918 almost 70,000 mines were laid spanning the North Sea's northern exits. The total number of mines laid in the North Sea, the British East Coast, Straits of Dover, and Heligoland Bight is estimated at 190,000 and the total number during the whole of WWI was 235,000 sea mines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seaclimate.com/5/pdf/5_14.pdf|title=Climate Change & Naval War\u2014A Scientific Assessment 2005\u2014Trafford on demand publishing, Canada/UK|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908115540/https://www.seaclimate.com/5/pdf/5_14.pdf|archivedate=2008-09-08}}</ref> Clearing the barrage after the war took 82 ships and five months, working around the clock.<ref>Gilbert, p.4.</ref> It was also during World War I, that the naval mine sunk its largest vessel ever, the British [[hospital ship]], [[HMHS Britannic|HMHS ''Britannic'']], which was the sister ship of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic.'']]\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:L L sweeping gear.jpg|thumb|The towed, electric cables of ''Double-L'', magnetic\u2013mine sweeping gear being deployed behind a Royal Navy minesweeper]]\nDuring [[World War II]], the [[U-boat]] fleet, which dominated much of the battle of the Atlantic, was small at the beginning of the war and much of the early action by German forces involved mining [[convoy]] routes and ports around Britain. German submarines also operated in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], in the [[Caribbean Sea]], and along the U.S. coast.\n\nInitially, contact mines (requiring a ship to physically strike a mine to detonate it) were employed, usually tethered at the end of a cable just below the surface of the water. Contact mines usually blew a hole in ships' hulls. By the beginning of World War II, most nations had developed mines that could be dropped from aircraft, some of which floated on the surface, making it possible to lay them in enemy harbours. The use of dredging and nets was effective against this type of mine, but this consumed valuable time and resources, and required harbours to be closed. Some of these mines have been found and archaeologically conserved.<ref>https://jefpat.maryland.gov/Pages/mac-lab/curators-choice/2019-curators-choice/2019-09-sea-mine-and-anchor.aspx</ref>\n\nLater, some ships survived mine blasts, limping into port with buckled plates and broken backs. This appeared to be due to a new type of mine, detecting ships by their proximity to the mine (an influence mine) and detonating at a distance, causing damage with the shock wave of the explosion. Ships that had successfully run the gauntlet<!-- properly gantlet, not gauntlet --> of the Atlantic crossing were sometimes destroyed entering freshly cleared British harbours. More shipping was being lost than could be replaced, and [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] ordered the intact recovery of one of these new mines to be of the highest priority.\n\nThe British experienced a stroke of luck in November 1939, when a German mine was dropped from an aircraft onto the mud flats off [[Shoeburyness]] during low tide. Additionally, the land belonged to the army and a base with men and workshops was at hand. Experts were dispatched from [[HMS Vernon]] to investigate the mine. The Royal Navy knew that mines could use magnetic sensors, Britain having developed magnetic mines in World War I, so everyone removed all metal, including their buttons, and made tools of non-magnetic [[brass]].<ref>Campbell, John, \"Naval Weapons of World War Two\" (London, UK: Conway Maritime Press, 1985)</ref> They disarmed the mine and rushed it to the labs at HMS Vernon, where scientists discovered that the mine had a magnetic arming mechanism. A large ferrous object passing through the Earth's [[magnetic field]] will concentrate the field through it; the mine's detector was designed to trigger as a ship passed over, when the Earth's magnetic field was concentrated in the ship and away from the mine. The mine detected this loss of the magnetic field which caused it to detonate. The mechanism had an adjustable sensitivity, calibrated in [[Gauss (unit)|milligauss]]. (As it turned out, the German firing mechanism was overly sensitive, making sweeping easier.)<ref>''The Wizard War''.</ref> The U.S. began adding delay counters to their magnetic mines in June 1945.<ref>Parillo, Mark P. ''Japanese Merchant Marine in World War Two'' (Annapolis, Md. : Naval Institute Press, 1993), p.200.</ref>\n\n[[File:Dwi wellington front.jpg|thumb|A [[Vickers Wellington]] fitted with a ''DWI'', magnetic mine exploder, [[Ismailia]], Egypt]]\nFrom this data, known methods were used to clear these mines. Early methods included the use of large electromagnets dragged behind ships or below low-flying aircraft (a number of older bombers like the [[Vickers Wellington]] were used for this). Both of these methods had the disadvantage of \"sweeping\" only a small strip. A better solution was found in the \"Double-L Sweep\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.GoodeveCA.net/CFGoodeve/cfg_bio.html#sweep|title= The Double-L Sweep\u2014Biography of Sir Charles Goodeve}}</ref> using electrical cables dragged behind ships that passed large pulses of current through the seawater. This created a large magnetic field and swept the entire area between the two ships. The older methods continued to be used in smaller areas. The [[Suez Canal]] continued to be swept by aircraft, for instance. Wartime Japanese sweep methods, by contrast, never advanced much past 1930s standards, and failed entirely to keep up with new American mines,<ref name=\"Parillo, p.200\">Parillo, p.200.</ref> clearing no more than 15% of all the mines laid in Japan's coastal waters.<ref name=\"Parillo, p.200\"/> Moreover, IJN's minesweeping force was far too small with 350 ships, and 20,000 men.<ref name=\"Parillo, p.201\">Parillo, p.201.</ref><!--RN ''lost'' that many 'sweepers for the duration!-->\n\nWhile these methods were useful for clearing mines from local ports, they were of little or no use for enemy-controlled areas. These were typically visited by warships, and the majority of the fleet then underwent a massive [[Degaussing#Ships.27 hulls|degaussing]] process, where their hulls had a slight \"south\" bias induced into them which offset the concentration effect almost to zero.\n\nInitially, major warships and large troopships had a copper ''degaussing coil'' fitted around the perimeter of the hull, energized by the ship's electrical system whenever in suspected magnetic-mined waters. Some of the first to be so fitted were the [[aircraft carrier|carrier]] [[HMS Ark Royal (91)|HMS ''Ark Royal'']] and the liners {{RMS|Queen Mary}} and {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth}}. It was a photo of one of these liners in New York harbor, showing the degaussing coil, which revealed to German Naval Intelligence the fact that the British were using degaussing methods to combat their magnetic mines.<ref>Piekalkiewicz, Janusz, \"Sea War: 1939\u20131945\" (Poole, UK: Blandford Press, 1987)</ref> This was felt to be impractical for smaller warships and merchant vessels, mainly because the ships lacked the generating capacity to energise such a coil. It was found that \"wiping\" a current-carrying cable up and down a ship's hull<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.GoodeveCA.net/CFGoodeve/cfg_bio.html#wipe|title= Wiping\u2014Biography of Sir Charles Goodeve}}</ref> temporarily cancelled the ships' magnetic signature sufficiently to nullify the threat. This started in late 1939, and by 1940 merchant vessels and the smaller British warships were largely immune for a few months at a time until they once again built up a field.\n\nThe cruiser [[HMS Belfast]] is just one example of a ship which was struck by a magnetic mine during this time. On the 21st November 1939, a mine broke her keel which damaged her engine and boiler rooms, as well as injuring 46 men with one man later dying from his injuries. She was towed to Rosyth for repairs. Incidents like this, resulted in many of the boats that sailed to [[Dunkirk evacuation|Dunkirk]] being degaussed in a marathon four-day effort by degaussing stations.{{sfn |Wingate|2004|pp=34\u201335}}\n\nThe Allies and Germany deployed acoustic mines in WW II, against which even wooden-[[hull (watercraft)|hull]]ed ships (in particular [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]]s) remained vulnerable.<ref name=\"Parillo, p.200\"/> Japan developed sonic generators to sweep these; the gear was not ready by war's end.<ref name=\"Parillo, p.200\"/> The primary method Japan used was small air-delivered bombs. This was profligate and ineffectual; used against acoustic mines at [[Penang]], 200 bombs were needed to detonate just 13 mines.<ref name=\"Parillo, p.200\"/>\n\nThe Germans developed a pressure-activated mine and planned to deploy it as well, but they saved it for later use when it became clear the British had defeated the magnetic system.

They are still used today, as they are extremely low cost compared to any other anti-ship weapon and are effective, both as a psychological weapon and as a method to sink enemy ships. Contact mines need to be touched by the target before they detonate, limiting the damage to the direct effects of the explosion and usually affecting only the vessel that triggers them.\n\nEarly mines had mechanical mechanisms to detonate them, but these were superseded in the 1870s by the \"Hertz horn\" (or \"chemical horn\"), which was found to work reliably even after the mine had been in the sea for several years. The mine's upper half is studded with hollow lead protuberances, each containing a glass vial filled with [[sulfuric acid]]. When a ship's hull crushes the metal horn, it cracks the vial inside it, allowing the acid to run down a tube and into a [[lead\u2013acid battery]] which until then contained no acid electrolyte. This energizes the battery, which detonates the explosive.<ref name=\"hartshorn.us\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hartshorn.us/Navy/navy-mines-01.htm |title=Moored-contact |first=Derick S. |last=Hartshorn |publisher=Mineman Memories |date=2010-04-17 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref>\n\nEarlier forms of the detonator employed a vial of sulfuric acid surrounded by a mixture of [[potassium perchlorate]] and sugar. When the vial was crushed, the acid ignited the perchlorate-sugar mix, and the resulting flame ignited the gunpowder charge.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Russian Rockefellers: the Saga of the Nobel Family and the Russian Oil Industry |last=Tolf |first=Robert W. |year=1982 |publisher=Hoover Institution Press |isbn=978-0-8179-6581-5 |page=[https://archive.org/details/russianrockefell00robe/page/18 18] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/russianrockefell00robe/page/18 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the initial period of World War I, the Royal Navy used contact mines in the English Channel and later in large areas of the North Sea to hinder patrols by German submarines. Later, the American antenna mine was widely used because submarines could be at any depth from the surface to the seabed. This type of mine had a copper wire attached to a buoy that floated above the explosive charge which was weighted to the seabed with a steel cable. If a submarine's steel hull touched the copper wire, the slight voltage change caused by contact between two dissimilar metals was amplified{{clarify|reason=amplified by what?|date=December 2015}} and detonated the explosives.<ref name=\"hartshorn.us\"/>\n\n==== Limpet mines ====\n{{Main|Limpet mine}}\nLimpet mines are a special form of contact mine that are manually attached to the target by magnets and remain in place. They are named because of the similarity to the [[limpet]], a [[mollusk]].\n\n====Moored contact mines====\n[[File:Mine (AWM 304925).jpg|thumb|A German contact mine laid in [[Axis naval activity in Australian waters|Australian waters]] during World War II]]\n\nGenerally, this mine type is set to float just below the surface of the water or as deep as five meters. A steel cable connecting the mine to an anchor on the seabed prevents it from drifting away. The explosive and detonating mechanism is contained in a buoyant metal or plastic shell. The depth below the surface at which the mine floats can be set so that only deep draft vessels such as aircraft carriers, battleships or large cargo ships are at risk, saving the mine from being used on a less valuable target. In [[littoral]] waters it is important to ensure that the mine does not become visible when the sea level falls at low tide, so the cable length is adjusted to take account of tides. During WWII there were mines that could be moored in 300m-deep water.\n\nFloating mines typically have a mass of around 200&nbsp;kg, including 80&nbsp;kg of explosives e.g. [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]], [[Minol (explosive)|minol]] or [[amatol]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://victoriancollections.net.au:8080/items/4f72bb6697f83e03086060cb|title=World War 2 Era Contact Sea Mine - Victorian Collections|website=victoriancollections.net.au|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref>\n\n====== Moored contact mines with plummet ======\n[[File: Legen_einer_Ankertaumine.svg|thumb|Sequence of laying a moored contact mine with a plummet]]\nA special form of moored contact mines are those equipped with a plummet. When the mine is launched (1), the mine with the anchor floats first and the lead plummet sinks from it (2). In doing so, the plummet unwinds a wire, the deep line, which is used to set the depth of the mine below the water surface before it is launched (3). When the deep line has been unwound to a set length, the anchor is flooded and the mine is released from the anchor (4). The anchor begins to sink and the mooring cable unwinds until the plummet reaches the sea floor (5). Due to the decreasing tension on the deep line, the mooring cable is clamped. The anchor sinks further down to the bottom of the sea pulling the mine as deep below the water surface as the deep line has been unwound (6). Thus, even without knowing the exact depth, an exact depth of the mine below the water surface can be set. Limited only by the maximum length of the mooring cable.\n\n==== Drifting contact mines ====\nDrifting mines were occasionally used during World War I and World War II. However, they were more feared than effective. Sometimes floating mines break from their moorings and become drifting mines; modern mines are designed to deactivate in this event. After several years at sea, the deactivation mechanism might not function as intended and the mines may remain live. [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|Admiral Jellicoe]]'s British fleet did not pursue and destroy the outnumbered German High Seas Fleet when it turned away at the [[Battle of Jutland]] because he thought they were leading him into a trap: he believed it possible that the Germans were either leaving floating mines in their wake, or were drawing him towards submarines, although neither of these was the case.\n\nAfter World War I the drifting contact mine was banned, but was occasionally used during World War II. The drifting mines were much harder to remove than tethered mines after the war, and they caused about the same damage to both sides.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.strausscenter.org/hormuz/mines.html|title=Mines \u2013 Hormuz|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nChurchill promoted \"[[Operation Royal Marine]]\" in 1940 and again in 1944 where floating mines were put into the [[Rhine]] in France to float down the river, becoming active after a time calculated to be long enough to reach German territory.\n\n===Remotely controlled mines===\nFrequently used in combination with coastal artillery and hydrophones, [[controlled mines]] (or command detonation mines) can be in place in peacetime, which is a huge advantage in blocking important shipping routes. The mines can usually be turned into \"normal\" mines with a switch (which prevents the enemy from simply capturing the controlling station and deactivating the mines), detonated on a signal or be allowed to detonate on their own. The earliest ones were developed around 1812 by [[Robert Fulton]]. The first remotely controlled mines were moored mines used in the American Civil War, detonated electrically from shore. They were considered superior to contact mines because they did not put friendly shipping at risk.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=19kDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA813&dq=Popular+Science+1933+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&hl=en&ei=sXYNTvyADIGLsAK8pbSRCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q&f=true  \"How Mines Help Guard America's Harbors\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', December 1940</ref> The extensive American fortifications program initiated by the [[Board of Fortifications]] in 1885 included [[Submarine mines in United States harbor defense|remotely controlled mines]], which were emplaced or in reserve from the 1890s through the end of World War II.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Berhow | first1 = Mark A., Ed. | last2 = | first2 = | title = American Seacoast Defenses, A Reference Guide, Third Edition | publisher = CDSG Press | year = 2015 | pages = 333\u2013374 | isbn = 978-0-9748167-3-9}}</ref>\n\nModern examples usually weigh {{convert|200|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, including {{convert|80|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of explosives (TNT or hexatonal).{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n===Influence mines===\n[[File:Luftmine (LM).jpg|thumb|upright|German parachute-retarded magnetic mine. Dropped by [[Luftwaffe]] bomber during WWII and landed on the ground. Fuse mechanisms are visible]]\nThese mines are triggered by the influence of a ship or submarine, rather than direct contact. Such mines incorporate [[Electronics|electronic]] sensors designed to detect the presence of a vessel and [[detonate]] when it comes within the [[explosion|blast]] range of the [[warhead]]. The fuses on such mines may incorporate one or more of the following sensors: [[magnetic]], passive [[Acoustic signature|acoustic]] or water [[pressure]] displacement caused by the proximity of a vessel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/man/dod-101/navy/docs/swos/cmd/miw/Sp6-4-1/sld001.htm |title=Title Slide |last=Garrold |first=Tim |work=Mine Warfare Introduction: The Threat |publisher=Surface Warfare Officers School Command, U.S. Navy |date=December 1998 |accessdate=2011-12-31}} Slide 1 of 81. Hosted by Federation of American Scientists.</ref>\n\nFirst used during WWI, their use became more general in WWII. The sophistication of influence mine fuses has increased considerably over the years as first [[transistor]]s and then [[microprocessor]]s have been incorporated into designs. Simple magnetic sensors have been superseded by total-field [[magnetometer]]s. Whereas early magnetic mine fuses would respond only to changes in a single component of a target vessel's magnetic field, a total field magnetometer responds to changes in the magnitude of the total background field (thus enabling it to better detect even degaussed ships). Similarly, the original broadband [[hydrophone]]s of 1940s acoustic mines (which operate on the integrated volume of all frequencies) have been replaced by narrow-band sensors which are much more sensitive and selective. Mines can now be programmed to listen for highly specific [[acoustic signature]]s (e.g. a [[gas turbine]] powerplant or [[cavitation]] sounds from a particular design of [[Screw propeller|propeller]]) and ignore all others. The sophistication of modern electronic mine fuzes incorporating these [[digital signal processing]] capabilities makes it much more difficult to detonate the mine with [[electronic countermeasures]] because several sensors working together (e.g. magnetic, passive acoustic and water pressure) allow it to ignore signals which are not recognised as being the unique signature of an intended target vessel.<ref name=\"fas.org\">{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/man/dod-101/navy/docs/swos/cmd/miw/Sp6-4-1/sld017.htm |title=World War II |last=Garrold |first=Tim |work=Mine Warfare Introduction: The Threat |publisher=Surface Warfare Officers School Command, U.S. Navy |date=December 1998 |accessdate=2011-12-31}} Slide 17 of 81. Hosted by Federation of American Scientists.</ref>\n\nModern influence mines such as the [[Stonefish (mine)|BAE Stonefish]] are [[embedded computer system|computerised]], with all the programmability this implies, such as the ability to quickly load new [[acoustic signature]]s into fuses, or program them to detect a single, highly distinctive target signature. In this way, a mine with a passive acoustic fuze can be programmed to ignore all friendly vessels and small enemy vessels, only detonating when a very large enemy target passes over it. Alternatively, the mine can be programmed specifically to ignore all surface vessels regardless of size and exclusively target submarines.\n\nEven as far back as WWII it was possible to incorporate a \"ship counter\" function in mine fuzes. This might set the mine to ignore the first two ships passing over it (which could be minesweepers deliberately trying to trigger mines) but detonate when the third ship passes overhead, which could be a high-value target such as an [[aircraft carrier]] or [[oil tanker]]. Even though modern mines are generally powered by a long life [[lithium battery]], it is important to conserve power because they may need to remain active for months or even years. For this reason, most influence mines are designed to remain in a semi-dormant state until an unpowered (e.g. deflection of a [[mu-metal]] [[magnetic compass|needle]]) or low-powered sensor detects the possible presence of a vessel, at which point the mine fuze powers up fully and the passive acoustic sensors will begin to operate for some minutes. It is possible to program computerised mines to delay activation for days or weeks after being laid. Similarly, they can be programmed to [[self-destruct]] or render themselves safe after a preset period of time. Generally, the more sophisticated the mine design, the more likely it is to have some form of [[anti-handling device]] to hinder clearance by divers or remotely piloted submersibles.<ref name=\"fas.org\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/man/dod-101/navy/docs/swos/cmd/miw/Sp6-4-1/sld031.htm |title=Mechanism |last=Garrold |first=Tim |work=Mine Warfare Introduction: The Threat |publisher=Surface Warfare Officers School Command, U.S. Navy |date=December 1998 |accessdate=2011-12-31}} Slide 31 of 81. Hosted by Federation of American Scientists.</ref>\n\n====Moored mines====\nThe moored mine is the backbone of modern mine systems. They are deployed where water is too deep for bottom mines. They can use several kinds of instruments to detect an enemy, usually a combination of acoustic, magnetic and pressure sensors, or more sophisticated optical shadows or electro potential sensors. These cost many times more than contact mines. Moored mines are effective against most kinds of ships. As they are cheaper than other anti-ship weapons they can be deployed in large numbers, making them useful [[area denial]] or \"channelizing\" weapons.\nMoored mines usually have lifetimes of more than 10 years, and some almost unlimited. These mines usually weigh {{convert|200|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, including {{convert|80|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of explosives ([[RDX]]). In excess of {{convert|150|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of explosives the mine becomes inefficient, as it becomes too large to handle and the extra explosives add little to the mine's effectiveness.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n====Bottom mines====\nBottom mines (sometimes called ground mines) are used when the water is no more than {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} deep or when mining for submarines down to around {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}. They are much harder to detect and sweep, and can carry a much larger warhead than a moored mine. Bottom mines commonly utilize multiple types of sensors, which are less sensitive to sweeping.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/man/dod-101/navy/docs/swos/cmd/miw/Sp6-4-1/sld033.htm|title=Influence Mines |last=Garrold |first=Tim |work=Mine Warfare Introduction: The Threat |publisher=Surface Warfare Officers School Command, U.S. Navy |date=December 1998 |accessdate=2011-12-31}} Slide 33 of 81.

Hosted by Federation of American Scientists.</ref>\n\n===Unusual mines===\nSeveral specialized mines have been developed for other purposes than the common minefield.\n\n====Bouquet mine====\nThe bouquet mine is a single anchor attached to several floating mines. It is designed so that when one mine is swept or detonated, another takes its place. It is a very sensitive construction and lacks reliability.\n\n====Anti-sweep mine====\nThe anti-sweep mine is a very small mine (40&nbsp;kg warhead) with as small a floating device as possible. When the wire of a mine sweep hits the anchor wire of the mine, it drags the anchor wire along with it, pulling the mine down into contact with the sweeping wire. That detonates the mine and cuts the sweeping wire. They are very cheap and usually used in combination with other mines in a minefield to make sweeping more difficult. One type is the Mark 23 used by the United States during World War II.\n\n====Oscillating mine====\nThe mine is hydrostatically controlled to maintain a pre-set depth below the water's surface independently of the rise and fall of the tide.\n\n====Ascending mine====\nThe ascending mine is a floating distance mine that may cut its mooring or in some other way float higher when it detects a target. It lets a single floating mine cover a much larger depth range.\n\n====Homing mines====\n[[File:Mark 60 CAPTOR-DF-ST-90-11649.JPEG|thumb|A CAPTOR mine being loaded onto a [[B-52 Stratofortress]] at [[Loring Air Force Base]]]]These are mines containing a moving weapon as a warhead, either a torpedo or a [[rocket (weapon)|rocket]].\n\n[[Rocket mine]]: a Russian invention, the rocket mine is a bottom distance mine that fires a homing high-speed rocket (not torpedo) upwards towards the target. It is intended to allow a bottom mine to attack surface ships as well as submarines from a greater depth. One type is the [[Te-1 rocket propelled mine]].\n\n[[Torpedo mine]]: the torpedo mine is a self-propelled variety, able to lie in wait for a target and then pursue it e.g. the [[Mark 60 CAPTOR]]. Generally, torpedo mines incorporate [[embedded computer system|computerised]] acoustic and magnetic fuzes. The U.S. Mark 24 \"mine\", code-named [[Mark 24 Mine|Fido]], was actually an [[Anti-submarine warfare|ASW]] [[homing torpedo]]. The mine designation was disinformation to conceal its function.\n\n====Mobile mine====\nThe mine is propelled to its intended position by propulsion equipment such as a torpedo. After reaching its destination, it sinks to the seabed and operates like a standard mine. It differs from the homing mine in that its mobile stage is before it lies in wait, rather than as part of the attacking phase.\n\nOne such design is the Mk 67 submarine launched mobile mine<ref>[https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/weaps/mk-67.htm MK 67 Submarine-Laid Mobile Mine (SLMM)]. Fas.org. Retrieved on 2010-12-02.</ref> (which is based on a [[Mark 37 torpedo]]) are capable of travelling as far as 10 miles through or into a channel, harbor, shallow water area and other zones which would normally be inaccessible to craft laying the device. After reaching the target area they sink to the sea bed and act like conventionally laid influence mines.\n\n====Nuclear mine====\nDuring the Cold War a test was conducted with naval mine fitted with tactical nuclear warheads for the \"Baker\" shot of [[Operation Crossroads]]. This weapon was experimental and never went into production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navalminewarfare.com/ |title=Australian Mine Warfare |first=Cameron |last=Stewart |work=Naval Mine Warfare |publisher=Naval Mine Warfare |date=2011-10-30 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref> There have been some reports that North Korea may be developing a nuclear mine<ref>{{cite web|author=Jon Rabiroff |url=http://www.stripes.com/news/u-s-military-enters-new-generation-of-sea-mine-warfare-1.143170 |title=U.S. military enters new generation of sea mine warfare \u2013 News |publisher=Stripes |date= |accessdate=2013-07-07}}</ref> The [[Seabed Arms Control Treaty]] prohibits the placement of nuclear weapons on the seabed beyond a 12-mile coast zone.\n\n====Daisy-chained mine====\nThis comprises two moored, floating contact mines which are tethered together by a length of steel cable or chain. Typically, each mine is situated approximately {{convert|60|ft|m}} away from its neighbour, and each floats a few metres below the surface of the ocean. When the target ship hits the steel cable, the mines on either side are drawn down the side of the ship's hull, exploding on contact. In this manner it is almost impossible for target ships to pass safely between two individually moored mines. Daisy-chained mines are a very simple concept which was used during World War II.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n====Dummy mine====\nPlastic drums filled with sand or concrete are periodically rolled off the side of ships as real mines are laid in large mine-fields. These inexpensive false targets (designed to be of a similar shape and size as genuine mines) are intended to slow down the process of mine clearance: a mine-hunter is forced to investigate each suspicious sonar contact on the sea bed, whether it is real or not. Often a maker of naval mines will provide both training and dummy versions of their mines.<ref name=\"MN103-MANTA Sea Mines\">{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716034740/http://www.sei-spa.com/mantaing.html |url=http://www.sei-spa.com/mantaing.html |title=MN103-MANTA Sea Mines |publisher=Sei Spa |archivedate=2011-07-16 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref>\n\n== Mine laying ==\n[[File:Mine laying ship Iran Ajr.jpg|thumb|Captured Iranian mine laying ship, ''[[Iran Ajr]]'' (left), a converted Japanese-built landing craft, 1987.]]\n\n[[File:US Navy 030321-N-4655M-029 Coalition Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) team members inspect camouflaged mines hidden inside oil barrels on the deck of an Iraqi shipping barge.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Camouflage]]d Iraqi mines hidden inside [[oil barrel]]s on a shipping barge in the [[Persian Gulf]], 2003.]]\n\nHistorically several methods were used to lay mines. During WWI and WWII, the Germans used [[U-boat]]s to lay mines around the UK. In WWII, aircraft came into favour for mine laying with one of the largest examples being the mining of the Japanese sea routes in [[Operation Starvation]].\n\nLaying a minefield is a relatively fast process with specialized ships, which is today the most common method. These minelayers can carry several thousand mines{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} and manoeuvre with high precision. The mines are dropped at predefined intervals into the water behind the ship. Each mine is recorded for later clearing, but it is not unusual for these records to be lost together with the ships. Therefore, many countries demand that all mining operations be planned on land and records kept so that the mines can later be recovered more easily.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sinodefence.com/navy/support/wolei.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809221420/http://www.sinodefence.com/navy/support/wolei.asp |title=Type 918 (Wolei Class) Minelayer |archivedate=2010-08-09 |work=Naval Forces: Vessels |publisher=SinoDefence.com |date=2008-06-16 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref>\n\nOther methods to lay minefields include:\n\n*Converted merchant ships \u2013 rolled or slid down ramps\n*Aircraft \u2013 descent to the water is slowed by a parachute\n*Submarines \u2013 launched from [[torpedo]] tubes or deployed from specialized mine racks on the sides of the submarine\n*Combat boats \u2013 rolled off the side of the boat\n*Camouflaged boats \u2013 masquerading as fishing boats\n*Dropping from the shore \u2013 typically smaller, shallow-water mines\n*Attack divers \u2013 smaller shallow-water mines\n\nIn some cases, mines are automatically activated upon contact with the water. In others, a safety [[lanyard]] is pulled (one end attached to the rail of a ship, aircraft or torpedo tube) which starts an automatic timer countdown before the arming process is complete. Typically, the automatic safety-arming process takes some minutes to complete. This allows the people laying the mines sufficient time to move out of its activation and blast zones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ordnance.org/Mines.htm |title=Aircraft-Laid Mines |work=Mines |publisher=The Ordnance Shop |accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref>\n\n===Aerial mining in World War II===\n{{also|Parachute mine}}\n====Germany====\nIn the 1930s, Germany had experimented with the laying of mines by aircraft.

In the next 20 months, mines delivered by aircraft sank or damaged 164 Axis ships with the loss of 94 aircraft. By comparison, direct aerial attacks on Axis shipping had sunk or damaged 105 vessels at a cost of 373 aircraft lost. The advantage of aerial mining became clear, and the UK prepared for it.

Johnson, CDR USNR, suggested massive aerial mining operations against Japan's \"outer zone\" (Korea and northern China) as well as the \"inner zone\", their [[Japanese Archipelago|home islands]]. First, aerial mines would have to be developed further and manufactured in large numbers. Second, laying the mines would require a sizable air group. The [[US Army Air Forces]] had the carrying capacity but considered mining to be the navy's job. The US Navy lacked suitable aircraft. Johnson set about convincing General [[Curtis LeMay]] of the efficacy of heavy bombers laying aerial mines.<ref>{{cite book |title=Spying Without Spies: Origins of America's Secret Nuclear Surveillance System |last=Ziegler |first=Charles A. |year=1995 |publisher=Praeger |isbn=0-275-95049-2 |page=118 }}</ref>\n\n[[B-24 Liberator]]s, [[PBY Catalina]]s and other bomber aircraft took part in localized mining operations in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|Southwest Pacific]] and the [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|China Burma India (CBI)]] theaters, beginning with a successful attack on the [[Yangon River]] in February 1943. Aerial minelaying operations involved a coalition of British, Australian and American aircrews, with the RAF and the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) carrying out 60% of the sorties and the USAAF and US Navy covering 40%. Both British and American mines were used. Japanese merchant shipping suffered tremendous losses, while Japanese mine sweeping forces were spread too thin attending to far-flung ports and extensive coastlines. Admiral [[Thomas C. Kinkaid]], who directed nearly all RAAF mining operations in CBI, heartily endorsed aerial mining, writing in July 1944 that \"aerial mining operations were of the order of 100 times as destructive to the enemy as an equal number of bombing missions against land targets.\"<ref name=\"Diane\"/>\n\nA single B-24 dropped three mines into [[Haiphong]] harbor in October 1943. One of those mines sank a Japanese freighter. Another B-24 dropped three more mines into the harbor in November, and a second freighter was sunk by a mine. The threat of the remaining mines prevented a convoy of ten ships from entering Haiphong; and six of those ships were sunk by attacks before they reached a safe harbor.

Advancing military forces worked to clear mines from newly-taken areas, but extensive minefields remained in place after the war. Air-dropped mines had an additional problem for mine sweeping operations: they were not meticulously charted. In Japan, much of the B-29 mine-laying work had been performed at high altitude, with the drifting on the wind of mines carried by parachute adding a randomizing factor to their placement. Generalized danger areas were identified, with only the quantity of mines given in detail. Mines used in Operation Starvation were supposed to be self-sterilizing, but the circuit did not always work. Clearing the mines from Japanese waters took so many years that the task was eventually given to the [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Development of Mine Warfare: A Most Murderous and Barbarous Conduct |last=Youngblood |first=Norman |year=2006 |publisher=Greenwood |isbn=0-275-98419-2 |page=141 }}</ref>\n\nFor the purpose of clearing all types of naval mines, the Royal Navy employed German crews and minesweepers from June 1945 to January 1948,<ref>[http://www.janmaat.de/m_gesch0.htm German Mine Sweeping Administration (GMSA)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420121039/http://www.janmaat.de/m_gesch0.htm |date=2008-04-20 }} (in German), accessed: 9 June 2008</ref> organised in the [[German Mine Sweeping Administration]] (GMSA), which consisted of 27,000 members of the former ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' and 300 vessels.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8Uczn3-3F34C&pg=PA41&lpg=PA41 Google book review: ''German Seaman 1939\u201345''] Page: 41, author: Gordon Williamson, John White, publisher: Osprey Publishing, accessed: 9 July 2008</ref> Mine clearing was not always successful: a number of ships were damaged or sunk by mines after the war.

(Elphick, p. 402.)</ref>\n\n==Damage==\n\nThe damage that may be caused by a mine depends on the \"[[shock factor]] value\", a combination of the initial strength of the explosion and of the distance between the target and the detonation. When taken in reference to ship hull plating, the term \"Hull Shock Factor\" (HSF) is used, while keel damage is termed \"Keel Shock Factor\" (KSF). If the explosion is directly underneath the keel, then HSF is equal to KSF, but explosions that are not directly underneath the ship will have a lower value of KSF.<ref name=Reid1996/>\n\n===Direct damage===\nUsually only created by contact mines, direct damage is a hole blown in the ship. Among the crew, [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]] wounds are the most common form of damage. Flooding typically occurs in one or two main watertight compartments, which can sink smaller ships or disable larger ones. Contact mine damage often occurs at or close to the waterline near the bow,<ref name=Reid1996/> but depending on circumstances a ship could be hit anywhere on its outer hull surface (the {{USS|Samuel B. Roberts|FFG-58|6}} mine attack being a good example of a contact mine detonating amidships and underneath the ship).\n\n===Bubble jet effect===\nThe bubble jet effect occurs when a mine or torpedo detonates in the water a short distance away from the targeted ship. The explosion creates a bubble in the water, and due to the difference in pressure, the bubble will collapse from the bottom. The bubble is buoyant, and so it rises towards the surface. If the bubble reaches the surface as it collapses, it can create a pillar of water that can go over a hundred meters into the air (a \"columnar plume\"). If conditions are right and the bubble collapses onto the ship's hull, the damage to the ship can be extremely serious; the collapsing bubble forms a high-energy jet that can break a metre-wide hole straight through the ship, flooding one or more compartments, and is capable of breaking smaller ships apart. The crew in the areas hit by the pillar are usually killed instantly. Other damage is usually limited.<ref name=Reid1996/>\n\nThe [[Baengnyeong incident]], in which the [[ROKS Cheonan (PCC-772)|ROKS ''Cheonan'']] broke in half and sank off the coast South Korea in 2010, was caused by the bubble jet effect, according to an international investigation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/20_05_10jigreport.pdf |title=Investigation Result on the Sinking of ROKS \"Cheonan\" by The Joint Civilian-Military Investigation Group|date=20 May 2010 |accessdate=27 January 2014|work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/26/world/asia/26korea.html |title=South Korea Cites Attack in Ship Sinking|newspaper=The New York Times|date=25 April 2010 |accessdate=25 April 2010 | first=Choe | last=Sang-Hun}}</ref>\n\n===Shock effect===\nIf the mine detonates at a distance from the ship, the change in water pressure causes the ship to resonate.

In this field the British, with their large seagoing navy, have had the bulk of world experience, and most anti-mine developments, such as [[degaussing]] and the double-L sweep, were British inventions. When on operational missions, such as the recent invasion of Iraq, the US still relies on British and Canadian minesweeping services. The US has worked on some innovative mine-hunting countermeasures, such as the use of [[military dolphin]]s to detect and flag mines. However, they are of questionable effectiveness.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Mines in nearshore environments remain a particular challenge. They are small and as technology has developed they can have anechoic coatings, be non-metallic, and oddly shaped to resist detection.<ref name=\"minewar\">Oceanography and Mine Warfare. Ocean Studies Board, National Research Council {{ISBN|0-309-51587-4}}</ref>{{rp|18}} Further, oceanic conditions and the sea bottoms of the area of operations can degrade sweeping and hunting efforts.<ref name=\"minewar\" />{{rp|18}} Mining countermeasures are far more expensive and time-consuming than mining operations, and that gap is only growing with new technologies.<ref name=\"minewar\" />{{rp|18}}\n\n=== Passive countermeasures ===\nShips can be designed to be difficult for mines to detect, to avoid detonating them. This is especially true for minesweepers and mine hunters that work in minefields, where a minimal signature outweighs the need for armour and speed. These ships have hulls of glass fibre or wood instead of steel to avoid magnetic signatures. These ships may use special propulsion systems, with [[low magnetic electric motor]]s, to reduce magnetic signature, and [[Voith-Schneider]] propellers, to limit the [[acoustic signature]]. They are built with hulls that produce a minimal pressure signature. These measures create other problems. They are expensive, slow, and vulnerable to enemy fire. Many modern ships have a mine-warning [[sonar]]\u2014a simple sonar looking forward and warning the crew if it detects possible mines ahead. It is only effective when the ship is moving slowly.<br/> <small>(See also [[SQQ-32 Mine-hunting sonar]])</small>\n\nA steel-hulled ship can be ''[[Degaussing|degaussed]]'' (more correctly, de-oerstedted or [[deperming|depermed]]) using a special degaussing station that contains many large coils and induces a magnetic field in the hull with alternating current to demagnetize the hull. This is a rather problematic solution, as magnetic compasses need recalibration and all metal objects must be kept in exactly the same place. Ships slowly regain their magnetic field as they travel through the Earth's magnetic field, so the process has to be repeated every six months.<ref>https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/weaps/degaussing.htm</ref>\n\nA simpler variation of this technique, called ''wiping'', was developed by [[Charles F. Goodeve]] which saved time and resources.\n\nBetween 1941 and 1943 the US Naval Gun factory (a division of the Naval Ordnance Laboratory) in Washington, D.C., built physical models of all US naval ships. Three kinds of steel were used in shipbuilding: mild steel for bulkheads, a mixture of mild steel and high tensile steel for the hull, and special treatment steel for armor plate. The models were placed within coils which could simulate the Earth's magnetic field at any location. The magnetic signatures were measured with degaussing coils. The objective was to reduce the vertical component of the combination of the Earth's field and the ship's field at the usual depth of German mines. From the measurements, coils were placed and coil currents determined to minimize the chance of detonation for any ship at any heading at any latitude.<ref name=\"eaglespeak.us\">{{cite web|first=Mark |last=Tempest |url=http://www.eaglespeak.us/2007/11/sunday-ship-history-degaussing-ships.html |title=Sunday Ship History: Degaussing Ships |work=EagleSpeak |publisher=Eaglespeak.us |date=2007-11-04 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref>\n\nSome ships are built with magnetic [[inductor]]s, large coils placed along the ship to counter the ship's magnetic field. Using magnetic probes in strategic parts of the ship, the strength of the current in the coils can be adjusted to minimize the total magnetic field. This is a heavy and clumsy solution, suited only to small-to-medium-sized ships. Boats typically lack the generators and space for the solution, while the amount of power needed to overcome the magnetic field of a large ship is impractical.<ref name=\"eaglespeak.us\"/>\n\n=== Active countermeasures ===\nActive countermeasures are ways to clear a path through a minefield or remove it completely. This is one of the most important tasks of any mine warfare flotilla.\n\n[[File:MH-53E Sea Dragon towing sled.jpg|thumb|An [[CH-53E Super Stallion|MH-53E]] from [[HM-15]] tows a minesweeping sled while conducting simulated mine clearing operations]]\n[[File:USS Tide sinking.jpg|thumb|Minesweeper {{USS|Tide|AM-125|6}} after striking a mine off [[Utah Beach]], 7 June 1944. Note her broken back, with smoke pouring from amidships.]]\n\n==== Mine sweeping ====\n{{main|Minesweeping}}\nA sweep is either a contact sweep, a wire dragged through the water by one or two ships to cut the mooring wire of floating mines, or a distance sweep that mimics a ship to detonate the mines. The sweeps are dragged by [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]]s, either purpose-built military ships or converted [[Commercial trawler|trawlers]]. Each run covers between one and two hundred meters, and the ships must move slowly in a straight line, making them vulnerable to enemy fire. This was exploited by the Turkish army in the [[Battle of Gallipoli]] in 1915, when mobile [[howitzer]] batteries prevented the British and French from clearing a way through minefields.\n\nIf a contact sweep hits a mine, the wire of the sweep rubs against the mooring wire until it is cut. Sometimes \"cutters\", explosive devices to cut the mine's wire, are used to lessen the strain on the sweeping wire. Mines cut free are recorded and collected for research or shot with a deck gun.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ussimplicitmso-455.com/Minesweeping.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402163450/http://www.ussimplicitmso-455.com/Minesweeping.html |archivedate=2009-04-02 |title=Mine Sweeping Operations |work=Minesweeping |publisher=Charles Lees |accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref>\n\nMinesweepers protect themselves with an [[Oropesa (minesweeping)|oropesa]] or [[Paravane (weapon)|paravane]] instead of a second minesweeper. These are torpedo-shaped towed bodies, similar in shape to a Harvey Torpedo, that are streamed from the sweeping vessel thus keeping the sweep at a determined depth and position. Some large warships were routinely equipped with paravane sweeps near the bows in case they inadvertently sailed into minefields\u2014the mine would be deflected towards the paravane by the wire instead of towards the ship by its wake. More recently, heavy-lift helicopters have dragged minesweeping sleds, as in the 1991 Persian Gulf War.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/paravane |title=Paravane \u2013 Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref>\n\nThe distance sweep mimics the sound and magnetism of a ship and is pulled behind the sweeper. It has floating coils and large underwater ''drums''. It is the only sweep effective against bottom mines.\n\nDuring WWII, [[RAF Coastal Command]] used [[Vickers Wellington]] bombers Wellington DW.Mk I fitted with degaussing coils to trigger magnetic mines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwiivehicles.com/unitedkingdom/aircraft/bomber/vickers-wellington.asp |title=Britain's Vickers Wellington bomber, 'Wimpey' |work=World War II Vehicles, Tanks, and Airplanes |publisher=Wwiivehicles.com |accessdate=2011-12-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118105920/http://www.wwiivehicles.com/unitedkingdom/aircraft/bomber/vickers-wellington.asp |archive-date=2011-11-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nModern influence mines are designed to discriminate against false inputs and are, therefore, much harder to sweep. They often contain inherent anti-sweeping mechanisms. For example, they may be programmed to respond to the unique noise of a particular ship-type, its associated magnetic signature and the typical pressure displacement of such a vessel. As a result, a mine-sweeper must accurately mimic the required target signature to trigger detonation. The task is complicated by the fact that an influence mine may have one or more of a hundred different potential target signatures programmed into it.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/man/dod-101/navy/docs/swos/cmd/miw/Sp6-4-1/sld034.htm |title=Mine Counter-Counter Measures (MCCM) |last=Garrold |first=Tim |work=Mine Warfare Introduction: The Threat |publisher=Surface Warfare Officers School Command, U.S. Navy |date=December 1998 |accessdate=2011-12-31}} Slide 34 of 81. Hosted by Federation of American Scientists.</ref>\n\nAnother anti-sweeping mechanism is a ship-counter in the mine fuze. When enabled, this allows detonation only after the mine [[fuze]] has been triggered a pre-set number of times. To further complicate matters, influence mines may be programmed to arm themselves (or disarm automatically\u2014known as ''self-sterilization'') after a pre-set time. During the pre-set arming delay (which could last days or even weeks) the mine would remain dormant and ignore any target stimulus, whether genuine or false.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nWhen influence mines are laid in an ocean minefield, they may have various combinations of fuze settings configured. For example, some mines (with the acoustic sensor enabled) may become active within three hours of being laid, others (with the acoustic and magnetic sensors enabled) may become active after two weeks but have the ship-counter mechanism set to ignore the first two trigger events, and still others in the same minefield (with the magnetic and pressure sensors enabled) may not become armed until three weeks have passed. Groups of mines within this mine-field may have different target signatures which may or may not overlap. The fuzes on influence mines allow many different permutations, which complicates the clearance process.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nMines with ship-counters, arming delays and highly specific target signatures in mine fuzes can falsely convince a belligerent that a particular area is clear of mines or has been swept effectively because a succession of vessels have already passed through safely.\n\n[[File:Minenjagddrohne Pinguin.jpg|thumb|left|''Pinguin B3'' mine hunting drone, such are operated from {{sclass-|Frankenthal|minehunter|1}}s of the [[German Navy]]]]\n\n==== Mine hunting ====\nAs naval mines have become more sophisticated, and able to discriminate between targets, so they have become more difficult to deal with by conventional sweeping. This has given rise to the practice of mine-hunting.\nMine hunting is very different from sweeping, although some [[minehunter]]s can do both tasks. Minehunting pays little attention to the nature of the mine itself. Nor does the method change much. At the current state of the art, Minehunting remains the best way to deal with influence mines proving to be both safer and more effective than sweeping. Specialized high-frequency sonars and high fidelity sidescaning sonar are used for mine location.<ref name=\"minewar\" />{{rp|18}}  Mines are hunted using sonar, then inspected and destroyed either by divers or [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]]s (remote controlled unmanned mini-submarines). It is slow, but also the most reliable way to remove mines. Minehunting started during the Second World War, but it was only after the war that it became truly effective.\n\nSea mammals (mainly the [[bottlenose dolphin]]) have been trained to hunt and mark mines, most famously by the [[U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program]]. Mine-clearance dolphins were deployed in the [[Persian Gulf]] during the [[Iraq War]] in 2003. The US Navy claims that these dolphins were effective in helping to clear more than 100 antiship mines and underwater [[booby trap]]s from [[Umm Qasr Port]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/issues/2003/september/phenomena.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070901162827/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/issues/2003/september/phenomena.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-09-01 |title=Uncle Sam's Dolphins |work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian Magazine]] |date=September 2003 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref>\n\nFrench naval officer [[Jacques Yves Cousteau]]'s Undersea Research Group was once involved in mine-hunting operations: They removed or detonated a variety of German mines, but one particularly defusion-resistant batch\u2014equipped with acutely sensitive pressure, magnetic, and acoustic sensors and wired together so that one explosion would trigger the rest\u2014was simply left undisturbed for years until corrosion would (hopefully) disable the mines.<ref>Cousteau, Jacques Yves.

An early example of this was [[David Farragut|Farragut's]] [[Battle of Mobile Bay|actions at Mobile Bay]] during the [[American Civil War]]. However, as mine warfare became more developed this method became uneconomical.\nThis method was revived by the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' during WWII. Left with a surfeit of idle ships due to the [[Blockade of Germany (1939\u201345)|Allied blockade]], the ''Kriegsmarine'' introduced a ship known as ''[[Sperrbrecher]]'' (\"block breaker\"). Typically an old cargo ship, loaded with cargo that made her less vulnerable to sinking (wood for example), the ''Sperrbrecher'' was run ahead of the ship to be protected, detonating any mines that might be in their path. The use of ''Sperrbrecher'' obviated the need to continuous and painstaking sweeping, but the cost was high. Over half the 100 or so ships used as ''Sperrbrecher'' were sunk during the war. Alternatively, a shallow draught vessel can be steamed through the minefield at high speed to generate a pressure wave sufficient to trigger mines, with the minesweeper moving fast enough to be sufficiently clear of the pressure wave so that triggered mines do not destroy the ship itself. These techniques are the only publicly known to be employed way to sweep pressure mines. The technique can be simply countered by use of a ship-counter, set to allow a certain number of passes before the mine is actually triggered. Modern doctrine calls for ground mines to be hunted rather than swept. A new system is being introduced for sweeping pressure mines, however counters are going to remain a problem.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navysbir.com/n07_s/navst07-030.htm |title=Influence Sweeping of Pressure Mines |publisher=U.S. Navy Small Business Innovation Research |date=2007-03-21 |accessdate=2011-12-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308200055/https://www.navysbir.com/n07_s/navst07-030.htm |archivedate=2012-03-08 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-Underwater-Warfare-Systems/Pressure-sweep-Sweden.html |title=Pressure sweep (Sweden) |work=Jane's Underwater Warfare Systems |publisher=Janes.com |date=2011-09-08 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref>\n\nAn updated form of this method is the use of small unmanned [[Remotely operated vehicle|ROV]]s (such as the [[Ensdorf class minesweeper|''Seehund'']] drone) that simulate the acoustic and magnetic signatures of larger ships and are built to survive exploding mines. Repeated sweeps would be required in case one or more of the mines had its \"ship counter\" facility enabled i.e. were programmed to ignore the first 2, 3, or even 6 target activations.\n\n== National arsenals ==\n\n===US mines===\nThe [[United States Navy]] [[MK56 ASW mine]] (the oldest still in use by the United States) was developed in 1966. More advanced mines include the [[CAPTOR mine|MK60 CAPTOR]] (short for \"encapsulated torpedo\"), the MK62 and MK63 Quickstrike and the MK67 SLMM (Submarine Launched Mobile Mine). Today, most U.S. naval mines are delivered by aircraft.\n\n<big>'''MK67 SLMM Submarine Launched Mobile Mine'''</big><br/>\nThe SLMM was developed by the United States as a submarine deployed mine for use in areas inaccessible for other mine deployment techniques or for covert mining of hostile environments. The SLMM is a shallow-water mine and is basically a modified [[Mark 37 torpedo]].\n\n'''General characteristics'''\n\n*Type: Submarine-laid bottom mine\n*Detection System: <nowiki>Magnetic/seismic/pressure target detection devices (TDDs)</nowiki>\n*Dimensions: {{convert|0.485|by|4.09|m|in|abbr=on}}\n*Depth Range: Shallow water\n*Weight: {{convert|754|kg|lb|abbr=on}}\n*Explosives: {{convert|230|kg|lb|abbr=on}} high explosive\n*Date Deployed: 1987\n\n[[File:US Navy 040705-N-1050K-004 A MK 62 Quick Strike mine is deployed from the starboard wing of a P-3C Orion aircraft form the Grey Knights of Patrol Squadron Four Six (VP-46).jpg|thumb|MK 62 Quick Strike deployed from a [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3 Orion]]]]\n<big>'''MK65 Quickstrike'''</big><br/>\nThe Quickstrike<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comomag.navy.mil/Mine%20History/General%20Information.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107222633/http://www.comomag.navy.mil/Mine%20History/General%20Information.aspx |archivedate=2006-11-07 |title=General Mine Information |work=Mine History |publisher=Commander Mobile Mine Assembly Group, U.S. Navy |location=Corpus Christi, Texas |accessdate=2011-12-31 }}</ref> is a family of shallow-water aircraft-laid mines used by the United States, primarily against surface craft. The MK65 is a 2,000-lb (900&nbsp;kg) dedicated, purpose-built mine. However, other Quickstrike versions (MK62, MK63, and MK64) are converted general-purpose bombs. These latter three mines are actually a single type of electronic [[fuze]] fitted to [[Mk82]], [[Mk83]] and [[Mk84]] air-dropped bombs. Because this latter type of Quickstrike fuze only takes up a small amount of storage space compared to a dedicated sea mine, the air-dropped bomb casings have dual purpose i.e. can be fitted with conventional contact fuzes and dropped on land targets, or have a Quickstrike fuze fitted which converts them into sea mines.\n\n'''General characteristics'''\n\n* Type: aircraft-laid bottom mine (with descent to water slowed by a parachute or other mechanism)\n* Detection System: <nowiki>Magnetic/seismic/pressure target detection devices (TDDs)</nowiki>\n* Dimensions: {{convert|0.74|by|3.25|m|in|abbr=on}}\n* Depth Range: Shallow water\n* Weight: {{convert|1086|kg|lb|abbr=on}}\n* Explosives: Various loads\n* Date Deployed: 1983\n\n<big>'''MK56'''</big><br/>\n'''General characteristics'''\n\n* Type: Aircraft laid moored mine\n* Detection System: Total field magnetic exploder\n* Dimensions: {{convert|0.570|by|2.9|m|in|abbr=on}}{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n* Depth Range: Moderate depths\n* Weight: {{convert|909|kg|lb|abbr=on}}\n* Explosives: {{convert|164|kg|lb|abbr=on}} HBX-3\n* Date Deployed: 1966\n\n===Royal Navy===\nAccording to a statement made to the UK Parliament in 2002:<ref>{{cite web |title=Hansard Written Answers |date=4 November 2002 |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo021104/text/21104w16.htm |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>...the Royal Navy does not have any mine stocks and has not had since 1992. Notwithstanding this, the United Kingdom retains the capability to lay mines and continues research into mine exploitation. Practice mines, used for exercises, continue to be laid in order to retain the necessary skills.</blockquote>\n\nHowever, a British company ([[BAE Systems]]) does manufacture the [[Stonefish (mine)|Stonefish]] influence mine for export to friendly countries such as Australia, which has both war stock and training versions of Stonefish,<ref>[http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/collins/ SSK Collins Class (Type 471) Attack Submarine].

Stonefish can be deployed by fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, surface vessels and submarines. An optional kit is available to allow Stonefish to be air-dropped, comprising an [[aerodynamic]] tail-fin section and [[parachute]] pack to retard the weapon's descent. The operating depth of Stonefish ranges between 30 and 200 metres. The mine weighs 990 kilograms and contains a 600 kilogram aluminised [[Polymer bonded explosive|PBX]] explosive [[warhead]].\n\n== Modern mine warfare challenges today ==\n\nMine warfare remains the most cost-effective of asymmetrical naval warfare. Mines are relatively cheap and being small allows them to be easily deployed. Indeed, with some kinds of mines, trucks and rafts will suffice. At present there are more than 300 different mines available. Some 50 countries currently have mining ability. The number of naval mine producing countries has increased by 75% since 1988. It is also noted that these mines are of an increasing sophistication while even the older type mines present a significant problem. It has been noted that mine warfare may become an issue with terrorist organizations. Mining busy shipping straits and mining shipping harbors remain some of the most serious threats.<ref name=\"minewar\" />{{rp|9}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bomb disposal]]\n* {{ship|HMHS|Britannic}}\n* [[Corfu Channel case]]\n* [[Land mine]]\n* [[Minesweeper]]\n* [[Minelayer]]\n* [[Admiralty Mining Establishment|Royal Navy's Admiralty Mining Establishment]]\n* [[Royal Naval Patrol Service]]\n* [[Shock factor]]\n* [[Mine planter (vessel)]]\n* [[Singer (naval mine)]]\n* [[Submarine mines in United States harbor defense]]\n* [[Stonefish (mine)|Stonefish influence mine]]\n* [[Operation Pocket Money]] (aerial mining campaign against North Vietnam in 1972)\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n*{{PD-old-text|title=Publication, Issue 33 Document (United States.

Two extensions have been constructed, and there are plans for further extensions through to 2025.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Overview==\nThe average daily flow is approximately 0.3&nbsp;[[gigalitre]]s (0.3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup> litres), out of a London average day demand of approximately 2.0 gigalitres  (2.0&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup> litres).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thameswater.co.uk/about-us/850_2613.htm|title=Our business|publisher=[[Thames Water]]|date=|accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thamestunnelconsultation.co.uk/2012/11/30/sustainable-drainage-and-the-%E2%80%98supersewer%E2%80%99/|title=Sustainable drainage and the Supersewer|first=Richard |last=Aylard|date=November 2012|accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref> The main currently comprises a major loop linking the [[Hampton, London|Hampton]], [[Walton-on-Thames|Walton]], [[Ashford, Surrey|Ashford]] and [[Kempton Park, Surrey|Kempton]] WTWs clustered on the Thames upstream of [[Teddington Lock|Teddington Weir]] to central London by a southern branch via [[Brixton]] and northern branch via [[Kew]], and a separate unconnected length from [[Coppermill Stream|Coppermills WTW]] to [[Stoke Newington]].  The main is well below most water mains, at a depth of {{convert|10|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|65|m|abbr=on}} below ground level and approximately {{convert|10|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} below sea-level.  It is connected to water supply zones by some 20 shafts that extend from the main to ground level.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Driver==\nThe main serves as a partial alternative transfer system to existing trunk mains suffering increasing frequencies and severities of leaks and bursts.  Some of the oldest operational pressure mains in the world (the oldest dates from 1838), the high-level trunks have weakened with steady corrosion, and there has been both an increased carrying requirement resulting from increasing water demand, and increasing external stresses resulting from higher vehicle weights and frequencies.  This has been exacerbated by limited system redundancies which has restricted preventative refurbishment.  The main has both extended the operational life of the high-level trunks by reducing the flow demands placed on them, and, by providing a high degree of redundancy, enabling key trunks to be isolated and maintained.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Hydraulics==\nFlow through the main is by gravity under the [[Hydraulic head|driving head]] of the service reservoirs at the source WTWs.  By virtue of its depth, the pipeline is under some pressure; however, the hydraulic grade line rarely exceeds ground level, and, to enter, supply water must be pumped up into the distribution zones at the pump-out shafts.  In some respects, therefore, the main can be considered as a minor reservoir, from which supply is drawn as required.  An indication of this dynamic variation in demand is that the minimum hydraulic level moves between the [[Battersea]] and Park Lane pump-out shafts.  The loop is closed to provide the redundancy that allows any segment on the ring to be isolated and drained for maintenance without interrupting the supply to any shaft, not for hydraulic reasons.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Construction==\nThe main was constructed in two phases: the southern leg from Ashford Common WTW to Barrow Hill Shaft in 1988 to 1991, and the northern leg between the same locations in 1991 to 1993.  Each phase was divided into a number of 'stages' that were separately contracted and constructed largely simultaneously. The different contractors involved in each stage is to some degree reflected in the variation in tunnelling and tunnel construction techniques used.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Geology==\nThe main lies mostly within [[London Clay]] with sections within the overlying alluvium and underlying [[Lambeth Group]] and [[Thanet_Formation|Thanet Sand]]. The predominance of the London Clay lengths is by design, as being easily excavated, largely impermeable and somewhat self-supporting for short periods it is a near-ideal tunnelling material. Where the hydraulics have required entry into the Lambeth Group and Thanet Sand, tunnelling was considerably more difficult. In particular, the Thanet Sand requires a high boring torque, is highly abrasive and, most challengingly, sufficiently permeable to contain a water table continuous with the underlying Chalk and measured at pressures up to {{convert|4|bar|abbr=on}}. An unexpected entry into the Thanet Sand while excavating near [[Tooting Commons|Tooting Bec Common]] led to the flooding of the tunnel and the temporary abandonment of a [[Tunnel boring machine|Tunnel Boring Machine]] (TBM). A further consideration of Thanet Sand is the presence of [[glauconite]], which oxidises on contact with air. The resulting de-oxygenated air resulted in two fatalities during the excavation of a pump-out shaft.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Future==\nThe main will be extended in stages over the coming decades. Work is currently under way to bridge the gap between the main loop at New River Head and the isolated segment at Stoke Newington and to extend a branch from the Brixton Shaft to Honor Oak reservoir. Both these projects are being assessed for their environmental sustainability through [[CEEQUAL]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Shafts==\nThe 21 shafts connecting the main to the surface are divided into:\n* 5 [[water treatment]] works (WTW), which supply clean water,\n* 11 [[pumping station]]s (PS), which withdraw water from the main,\n* 3 access shafts, where no water transfer occurs, and\n* 2 storage locations, where water is supplied or withdrawn as demand fluctuates.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n===North leg===\n*[[Ashford Common]] \u2014 WTW\n*[[Kempton Park, Surrey|Kempton Park]] \u2014 WTW\n*[[Mogden]], [[Isleworth]] \u2014 Access\n*[[Kew]] \u2014 PS\n*[[Barnes, London|Barnes]] \u2014 balancing storage\n*[[Holland Park|Holland Park Avenue]] \u2014 PS\n*[[Primrose Hill|Barrow Hill, Primrose Hill]] \u2014 PS\n\n===South leg===\n*Ashford Common \u2014 WTW\n*[[Walton-on-Thames|Walton]] \u2014 WTW\n*[[Hampton, London|Hampton]] \u2014 WTW\n*[[Surbiton]] \u2014 PS\n*[[Hogsmill]] \u2014 Access\n*[[Raynes Park]] \u2014 Access\n*[[Merton (historic parish)|Merton]] \u2014 PS\n*[[Streatham]] \u2014 PS\n*[[Brixton]] \u2014 PS\n*[[Battersea]] \u2014 PS\n*[[Park Lane, London|Park Lane]] \u2014 PS\n*Barrow Hill \u2014 PS\n\n===North extension===\n*Barrow Hill \u2014 PS\n*[[New River Head]] \u2014 PS<br>''under construction''\n*[[Stoke Newington]] \u2014 PS\n*[[Coppermill Stream|Coppermills]] \u2014 WTW\n\n===South extension===\n*Brixton \u2014 PS<br>''under construction''\n*[[Honor Oak]] \u2014 underground storage\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n* {{cite book |year=1994 |title=Thames Water Ring Main |work=Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers |volume=102 |issue=special issue 2 |location=London |publisher=Telford |isbn= 0-7277-2003-1}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.thameswater.co.uk/about-us/850_2599.htm |date=July 2007  |title=London Ring Main extensions commence |publisher=[[Thames Water|Thames Water Utilities]]}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.tunnels.mottmac.com/projects/?mode=type&id=113114 |title=Thames Water Tunnels |publisher=[[Mott Macdonald]] |postscript=, contractor for the current extensions}}\n* {{cite journal |url=https://www.e-sciencecentral.org/articles/Figure.php?xn=eer/eer-18-2-57-2&id=f10-eer-18-2-57-2&mode=export |title=(a) Thames Water Ring Main: existing tunnels and tunnels under construction and (b) the 21 shafts connecting the ring main to the surface. |publisher= Environmental Engineering Research 2013; 18(2): 57-63. |postscript=, Map and diagram of the ring main.

Two extensions have been constructed, and there are plans for further extensions through to 2025.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Overview==\nThe average daily flow is approximately 0.3&nbsp;[[gigalitre]]s (0.3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup> litres), out of a London average day demand of approximately 2.0 gigalitres  (2.0&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup> litres).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thameswater.co.uk/about-us/850_2613.htm|title=Our business|publisher=[[Thames Water]]|date=|accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thamestunnelconsultation.co.uk/2012/11/30/sustainable-drainage-and-the-%E2%80%98supersewer%E2%80%99/|title=Sustainable drainage and the Supersewer|first=Richard |last=Aylard|date=November 2012|accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref> The main currently comprises a major loop linking the [[Hampton, London|Hampton]], [[Walton-on-Thames|Walton]], [[Ashford, Surrey|Ashford]] and [[Kempton Park, Surrey|Kempton]] WTWs clustered on the Thames upstream of [[Teddington Lock|Teddington Weir]] to central London by a southern branch via [[Brixton]] and northern branch via [[Kew]], and a separate unconnected length from [[Coppermill Stream|Coppermills WTW]] to [[Stoke Newington]].  The main is well below most water mains, at a depth of {{convert|10|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|65|m|abbr=on}} below ground level and approximately {{convert|10|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} below sea-level.  It is connected to water supply zones by some 20 shafts that extend from the main to ground level.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Driver==\nThe main serves as a partial alternative transfer system to existing trunk mains suffering increasing frequencies and severities of leaks and bursts.  Some of the oldest operational pressure mains in the world (the oldest dates from 1838), the high-level trunks have weakened with steady corrosion, and there has been both an increased carrying requirement resulting from increasing water demand, and increasing external stresses resulting from higher vehicle weights and frequencies.  This has been exacerbated by limited system redundancies which has restricted preventative refurbishment.  The main has both extended the operational life of the high-level trunks by reducing the flow demands placed on them, and, by providing a high degree of redundancy, enabling key trunks to be isolated and maintained.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Hydraulics==\nFlow through the main is by gravity under the [[Hydraulic head|driving head]] of the service reservoirs at the source WTWs.  By virtue of its depth, the pipeline is under some pressure; however, the hydraulic grade line rarely exceeds ground level, and, to enter, supply water must be pumped up into the distribution zones at the pump-out shafts.  In some respects, therefore, the main can be considered as a minor reservoir, from which supply is drawn as required.  An indication of this dynamic variation in demand is that the minimum hydraulic level moves between the [[Battersea]] and Park Lane pump-out shafts.  The loop is closed to provide the redundancy that allows any segment on the ring to be isolated and drained for maintenance without interrupting the supply to any shaft, not for hydraulic reasons.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Construction==\nThe main was constructed in two phases: the southern leg from Ashford Common WTW to Barrow Hill Shaft in 1988 to 1991, and the northern leg between the same locations in 1991 to 1993.  Each phase was divided into a number of 'stages' that were separately contracted and constructed largely simultaneously. The different contractors involved in each stage is to some degree reflected in the variation in tunnelling and tunnel construction techniques used.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Geology==\nThe main lies mostly within [[London Clay]] with sections within the overlying alluvium and underlying [[Lambeth Group]] and [[Thanet_Formation|Thanet Sand]]. The predominance of the London Clay lengths is by design, as being easily excavated, largely impermeable and somewhat self-supporting for short periods it is a near-ideal tunnelling material. Where the hydraulics have required entry into the Lambeth Group and Thanet Sand, tunnelling was considerably more difficult. In particular, the Thanet Sand requires a high boring torque, is highly abrasive and, most challengingly, sufficiently permeable to contain a water table continuous with the underlying Chalk and measured at pressures up to {{convert|4|bar|abbr=on}}. An unexpected entry into the Thanet Sand while excavating near [[Tooting Commons|Tooting Bec Common]] led to the flooding of the tunnel and the temporary abandonment of a [[Tunnel boring machine|Tunnel Boring Machine]] (TBM). A further consideration of Thanet Sand is the presence of [[glauconite]], which oxidises on contact with air. The resulting de-oxygenated air resulted in two fatalities during the excavation of a pump-out shaft.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Future==\nThe main will be extended in stages over the coming decades. Work is currently under way to bridge the gap between the main loop at New River Head and the isolated segment at Stoke Newington and to extend a branch from the Brixton Shaft to Honor Oak reservoir. Both these projects are being assessed for their environmental sustainability through [[CEEQUAL]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Shafts==\nThe 21 shafts connecting the main to the surface are divided into:\n* 5 [[water treatment]] works (WTW), which supply clean water,\n* 11 [[pumping station]]s (PS), which withdraw water from the main,\n* 3 access shafts, where no water transfer occurs, and\n* 2 storage locations, where water is supplied or withdrawn as demand fluctuates.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n===North leg===\n*[[Ashford Common]] \u2014 WTW\n*[[Kempton Park, Surrey|Kempton Park]] \u2014 WTW\n*[[Mogden]], [[Isleworth]] \u2014 Access\n*[[Kew]] \u2014 PS\n*[[Barnes, London|Barnes]] \u2014 balancing storage\n*[[Holland Park|Holland Park Avenue]] \u2014 PS\n*[[Primrose Hill|Barrow Hill, Primrose Hill]] \u2014 PS\n\n===South leg===\n*Ashford Common \u2014 WTW\n*[[Walton-on-Thames|Walton]] \u2014 WTW\n*[[Hampton, London|Hampton]] \u2014 WTW\n*[[Surbiton]] \u2014 PS\n*[[Hogsmill]] \u2014 Access\n*[[Raynes Park]] \u2014 Access\n*[[Merton (historic parish)|Merton]] \u2014 PS\n*[[Streatham]] \u2014 PS\n*[[Brixton]] \u2014 PS\n*[[Battersea]] \u2014 PS\n*[[Park Lane, London|Park Lane]] \u2014 PS\n*Barrow Hill \u2014 PS\n\n===North extension===\n*Barrow Hill \u2014 PS\n*[[New River Head]] \u2014 PS<br>''under construction''\n*[[Stoke Newington]] \u2014 PS\n*[[Coppermill Stream|Coppermills]] \u2014 WTW\n\n===South extension===\n*Brixton \u2014 PS<br>''under construction''\n*[[Honor Oak]] \u2014 underground storage\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n* {{cite book |year=1994 |title=Thames Water Ring Main |work=Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers |volume=102 |issue=special issue 2 |location=London |publisher=Telford |isbn= 0-7277-2003-1}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.thameswater.co.uk/about-us/850_2599.htm |date=July 2007  |title=London Ring Main extensions commence |publisher=[[Thames Water|Thames Water Utilities]]}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.tunnels.mottmac.com/projects/?mode=type&id=113114 |title=Thames Water Tunnels |publisher=[[Mott Macdonald]] |postscript=, contractor for the current extensions}}\n* {{cite journal |url=https://www.e-sciencecentral.org/articles/Figure.php?xn=eer/eer-18-2-57-2&id=f10-eer-18-2-57-2&mode=export |title=(a) Thames Water Ring Main: existing tunnels and tunnels under construction and (b) the 21 shafts connecting the ring main to the surface. |publisher= Environmental Engineering Research 2013; 18(2): 57-63. |postscript=, Map and diagram of the ring main.

A [[Bus deregulation in the United Kingdom|post-deregulation]] joint venture between [[Weston-super-Mare]] based bus company [[Badgerline]] and [[Isle of Wight]] bus company [[Southern Vectis]], it was set up in September 1987 to compete with incumbent operator [[Wilts & Dorset]]. The buses all used the [[Badgerline]] brand. After a noted [[Bus deregulation in the United Kingdom#Bus wars|bus war]] between the two large companies, Badger Vectis folded in March 1988.\n\n==Formation==\nBadger Vectis was formed in September 1987 as a [[joint venture]] between [[Badgerline]] (80%) and [[Southern Vectis]] (20%), after both recently privatised bus companies had failed in a joint bid earlier in the year to buy [[Wilts & Dorset]], which was, like its suitors, a former nationalised [[National Bus Company (UK)|National Bus Company]] subsidiary. Wilts & Dorset had instead been privatised via a [[management buyout]].<ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/2nd-july-1987/25/wilts-bought-out Wilts bought out] ''Commercial Motor'' 2 July 1987 page 25</ref> Badgerline had already been competing with Wilts & Dorset in [[Salisbury]] since June 1987, while Southern Vectis had already set up a mainland subsidiary, [[Bluestar (bus company)|Solent Blue Line]], to compete in [[Southampton]].\n\nHeaded by a regional director from Badgerline, the new operation used vehicles from both partners, as well as from elsewhere, and rented garage space from the other local operator [[Yellow Buses]] at their Mallard Road depot, in north-east [[Bournemouth]]. It traded as Badgerline, using the same livery as its parent company, although with more green on the front of buses, due to a perceived clash with Yellow Buses' livery.\n\n==Operation==\nBadger Vectis competed with Wilts & Dorset using a network focused on urban routes, radiating from Poole, with an important corridor being the coast road between Poole and Bournemouth. The company's tactic was to use a combination of a frequent and simple to understand [[Iveco]] minibus operated routes, branded as ''Minilinks'', together with 2 person [[Conductor (transportation)#Bus conductor|crew-operated]] larger buses, [[Bristol RE]] single-deck buses, to compete with Wilts & Dorset's largely archaic, complex and infrequent, established operations, which had no minibuses and no crew operated buses, and which had routes which ranged over a large rural area as well as the conurbation. Badger Vectis also operated cross-linked services to differentiate itself with Wilts & Dorset's routes.\n\nAfter just a week, Wilts & Dorset retaliated by setting up a high-frequency sub-brand of its own, called ''Skippers'', initially using conventional buses, but from November, using brand new [[MCW Metrorider]] minibuses. The competition saw the Poole to Bournemouth corridor eventually served by a total of 18 buses an hour.\n\nBadger Vectis did not operate into Poole bus station however, which was described as a major problem. Other issues for the company which emerged were reliability problems with its older Bristol REs, as well as recruitment issues, and the relatively higher cost of crew operation. Despite their garage rental arrangement, by the beginning of March 1988, Badger Vectis also began to compete directly with Yellow Buses, having previously avoided their routes.\n\n==Cessation==\nThe financial health of Badger Vectis declined due to its problems, and the retaliation by Wilts & Dorset. In a development described as an implosion, Badger Vectis gave notice to the traffic commissioner that it would stop operating in early May 1988.<ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/7th-april-1988/15/badgerline-loses-bus-war Badgerline loses bus war] ''Commercial Motor'' 7 April 1988 page 15</ref> The company closed early however, on 29 March, after employees were told that the company would no longer be operating and were offered a deal not to speak to the press.

This was in contrast to the norm which had been, and continued to be for some years afterward, characterised by small operators taking on large incumbents to take a share of their profitable routes in short term competition, and then either withdraw, fail, or be bought out by the incumbent. Industry insiders had at the time predicted however that in this case, by Christmas 1987 Badger Vectis had come very close to forcing Wilts & Dorset to cease operating entirely, had it continued with its own expansion in their territory.\n\nAlthough Badger Vectis was a failure, Badgerline itself continued its aggressive strategy, and went on to form one of the largest private transport groups in the United Kingdom, [[FirstGroup]] in June 1995.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/badgerline-links-with-grt-1614291.html Badgerline links with GRT] ''The Independent'' 5 April 1995</ref><ref>[http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/link-up-creates-second-largest-bus-group-grt-and-badgerline-in-agreed-265m-merger-1.686692 Link-up creates second largest bus group: GRT and Badgerline in agreed \u00a3265m merger] ''Herald Scotland'' 5 April 1995</ref> Both Wilts & Dorset and Southern Vectis also continued to operate, ironically coming together under common ownership, both being acquired by the [[Go-Ahead Group]], and now both operating as part of its [[Go South Coast]] division.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/aug/12/transportintheuk Bus buy for Go-Ahead] ''The Guardian'' 12 August 2003</ref><ref>[http://www.go-ahead.com/media/news/archive/2005-07-11.aspx Recommended Cash Offer for Southern Vectis plc] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015001908/http://www.go-ahead.com/media/news/archive/2005-07-11.aspx |date=15 October 2013 }} Go-Ahead Group 11 July 2005</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*Omnibuses blog, ''Badger Bitter'' [http://omnibuses.blogspot.com/2007/09/badger-bitter.html Part 1], [http://omnibuses.blogspot.com/2007/09/badger-bitter-pt-2.htmlPart 2], [http://omnibuses.blogspot.com/2008/03/badger-bitter-pt-3.html Part 3], 8 September 2007 \u2013 29 March 2008\n\n==External links==\n*[http://bcv.robsly.com/badgerv.html Gallery]\n\n{{Defunct British Bus Companies}}\n\n[[Category:Former bus operators in England]]\n[[Category:1987 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:1988 disestablishments in England]]\n[[Category:Former bus operators in Dorset]]\n[[Category:Former bus operators in Hampshire]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=May 2017}}\n{{Infobox Bus transit\n|name           = Badger Vectis\n|logo           = <!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: Badgerline.svg -->\n|logo_size      = 250\n|image          = \n|image_size     = \n|image_caption  = \n|company_slogan = \n|parent         = [[Badgerline]] (80%)<br>[[Southern Vectis]] (20%)\n|founded        = September 1987\n|ceased         = March 1988\n|headquarters   = [[Poole]]\n|locale         = \n|service_area   = [[Poole]] & [[Bournemouth]]\n|service_type   = Bus operator\n|hubs           = \n|stations       =\n|depots         = \n|routes         = \n|fleet           = \n|ridership      = \n|fuel_type      = \n|operator       = \n|ceo            = }}\n\n'''Badger Vectis''' was an English bus company based in [[Poole]].
