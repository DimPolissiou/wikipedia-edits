Payment for personal medical services is offered by a [[universal health care]] insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. All residents of [[Japan]] are required by the law to have health insurance coverage. People without insurance from employers can participate in a national [[health insurance]] programme, administered by local governments. Patients are free to select physicians or facilities of their choice and cannot be denied coverage. Hospitals, by law, must be run as non-profit and be managed by physicians. \n\nMedical fees are strictly regulated by the government to keep them affordable.

Surgical outcomes tend to be better in Japan for most cancers while overall survival tend to be longer in the US due to the more aggressive use of chemotherapy in late stage cancers. A comparison of the data from United States Renal Data System (USRDS) 2009 and Japan Renology Society 2009 shows that the annual mortality of patients undergoing dialysis in Japan is 13% compared to 22.4% in the US.

Despite reforms, Japan's psychiatric hospitals continue to largely rely on outdated methods of patient control, with their rates of compulsory medication, isolation (solitary confinement) and [[physical restraints]] (tying patients to beds) much higher than in other countries.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Steinert|first=T.|display-authors=etal|title= Incidence of seclusion and restraint in psychiatric hospitals: A literature review and survey of international trends. |journal=Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol|date=2010|volume=45 |issue=9|pages=889\u2013897|doi=10.1007/s00127-009-0132-3}}</ref> High levels of deep vein thrombosis have been found in restrained patients in Japan, which can lead to disability and death.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ishida|first=Takuto|display-authors=etal|title=Incidence of Deep Vein Thrombosis in Restrained Psychiatric Patients |journal=Psychosomatics |date=2014 |volume=55 |pages=69\u201375 |doi=10.1016/j.psym.2013.04.001}}</ref>  Rather than decreasing the use of restraints as has been done in many other countries,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Masters|first=Kim|title=Physical Restraint: A Historical Review and Current Practice |date=2017 |journal=Psychiatr Ann. 2017 |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=52\u201355 |doi=10.3928/00485713-20161129-01}}</ref> the incidence of use of [[medical restraints]] in Japanese hospitals doubled in the nearly ten years from 2003 (5,109 restrained patients) through 2014 (10,682).<ref>https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/07/18/national/family-blames-prolonged-use-restraints-kanagawa-hospital-english-teachers-death/#.WqzXWahuZPZ</ref>\n \nThe 47 local government prefectures have some responsibility for overseeing the quality of health care, but there is no systematic collection of treatment or outcome data.

In 2015 Japan introduced a law to require hospitals to conduct reviews of patient care for any unexpected deaths, and to provide the reports to the next of kin and a third party organization.  However, it is up to the hospital to decide whether the death was unexpected.  Neither patients nor the patients' families are allowed to request reviews, which makes the system ineffective.<ref>https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/10/05/reference/shortcomings-identified-new-reporting-system-hospital-deaths/#.Wrn0_YhuZPY</ref><ref>https://yomidr.yomiuri.co.jp/article/20170810-OYTET50009/</ref>\n\nIt is important to have efficiency in sending patients to the correct medical location because there is an under-staffing problem. Around 92% of hospitals in Japan have an insufficient number of doctors while having sufficient nurses. While only 10% of hospitals have a sufficient number of doctors and an insufficient number of nurses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mhlw.go.jp/english|title=Welcome to Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare,}}</ref>\n\n== Access ==\n[[File:Superambulance-fuso.jpg|thumb|Japanese Super Ambulance, [[Tokyo Fire Department]]]]\nIn Japan, services are provided either through regional/national public hospitals or through private hospitals/clinics, and patients have universal access to any facility, though hospitals tend to charge more to those patients without a referral. As above, costs in Japan tend to be quite low compared to those in other developed countries, but utilization rates are much higher. Most one doctor clinics do not require reservations and same day appointments are the rule rather than the exception. Japanese patients favor medical technology such as CT scans and MRIs, and they receive MRIs at a per capita rate 8 times higher than the British and twice as high as  Americans.<ref name=\"Sick\"/> In most cases, CT scans, MRIs and many other tests do not require waiting periods.

Some patients with mild illnesses tend to go straight to hospital [[emergency departments]] rather than accessing more appropriate primary care services. This causes a delay in helping people who have more urgent and severe conditions who need to be treated in the hospital environment. There is also a problem with misuse of ambulance services, with many people taking ambulances to hospitals with minor issues not requiring an ambulance. In turn this causes delays for ambulances arriving to serious emergencies. Nearly 50% of the ambulance rides in 2014 were minor conditions where citizens could have taken a taxi instead of an ambulance to get treated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bmcemergmed.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12873-017-0135-4?site=bmcemergmed.biomedcentral.com.|title=Open Access Misuse of Emergent Healthcare in Contemporary Japan.|last=Asai|first=Kadooka|date=July 14, 2017|accessdate=December 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\nDue to the issue of large numbers of people visiting hospitals for relatively minor problems, shortage of medical resources can be an issue in some regions.

However, the copayment rates differed greatly. While those who enrolled in employees' health insurance needed to pay only a nominal amount at the first physician visit, their dependents and those who enrolled in National Health Insurance had to pay 50% of the fee schedule price for all services and medications.

In 2015 Japan introduced a law to require hospitals to conduct reviews of patient care for any unexpected deaths, and to provide the reports to the next of kin and a third party organization.  However, it is up to the hospital to decide whether the death was unexpected.  Neither patients nor the patients' families are allowed to request reviews, which makes the system ineffective.<ref>https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/10/05/reference/shortcomings-identified-new-reporting-system-hospital-deaths/#.Wrn0_YhuZPY</ref><ref>https://yomidr.yomiuri.co.jp/article/20170810-OYTET50009/</ref>\n\nIt is important to have efficiency in sending patients to the correct medical location because there is an under-staffing problem.

As above, costs in Japan tend to be quite low compared to those in other developed countries, but utilization rates are much higher.

Some patients with mild illnesses tend to go straight to hospital [[emergency departments]] rather than accessing more appropriate primary care services. This causes a delay in helping people who have more urgent and severe conditions who need to be treated in the hospital environment. There is also a problem with misuse of ambulance services, with many people taking ambulances to hospitals with minor issues not requiring an ambulance. In turn this causes delays for ambulances arriving to serious emergencies. Nearly 50% of the ambulance rides in 2014 were minor conditions where citizens could have taken a taxi instead of an ambulance to get treated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bmcemergmed.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12873-017-0135-4?site=bmcemergmed.biomedcentral.com.|title=Open Access Misuse of Emergent Healthcare in Contemporary Japan.|last=Asai|first=Kadooka|date=July 14, 2017|accessdate=December 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\nDue to the issue of large numbers of people visiting hospitals for relatively minor problems, shortage of medical resources can be an issue in some regions. The problem has become a wide concern in Japan, particularly in Tokyo. A report has shown that more than 14,000 emergency patients were rejected at least three times by hospitals in Japan before getting treatment. A government survey for 2007, which got a lot of attention when it was released in 2009, cited several such incidents in the Tokyo area, including the case of an elderly man who was turned away by 14 hospitals before dying 90 minutes after being finally admitted,<ref name=\"abcnews.2009\">{{cite web |date= February 4, 2009|url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/29013386/ns/world_news-asia_pacific/t/injured-man-dies-after-rejection-hospitals/ |title = Injured man dies after rejection by 14 hospitals|work=[[Associated Press]] |publisher = [[NBC News]]| last= Yamaguchi, Mari|quote=}}</ref> and that of a pregnant woman complaining of a severe headache being refused admission to seven Tokyo hospitals and later dying of an undiagnosed [[brain hemorrhage]] after giving birth.<ref name=\"japantimes.6.2008\">{{cite web |date= Nov 6, 2008|url = http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081106a7.html|title = Another case emerges of pregnant woman rejected by Tokyo hospitals|publisher = [[The Japan Times]]| accessdate = January 28, 2010 | last=Kyodo News |quote=}}</ref> The so-called \"tarai mawashi\" (ambulances being rejected by multiple hospitals before an emergency patient is admitted) has been attributed to several factors such as medical imbursements set so low that hospitals need to maintain very high occupancy rates in order to stay solvent, hospital stays being cheaper for the patient than low cost hotels, the shortage of specialist doctors and low risk patients with minimal need for treatment flooding the system.\n\n==Insurance==\nHealth insurance is, in principle, mandatory for residents of Japan, but there is no penalty for the 10% of individuals who choose not to comply, making it optional in practice.<ref>http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/85466/E92927.pdf</ref><ref name=\"npr.2008\">{{cite web |date= April 14, 2008|url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89626309|title = Japanese Pay Less for More Health Care|format = |publisher = [[National Public Radio|NPR]]| accessdate = January 28, 2010 | last=Reid, T.R. |quote=}}</ref>  There are a total of eight health insurance systems in Japan,<ref name=\"kagoshima\">{{cite web|year = 2010|url = http://www.city.kagoshima.lg.jp/_1010/shimin/foreigner/foreigner-eng-1/0005357.html|title = Health Insurance|publisher = [[kagoshima|City of Kagoshima]]|accessdate = January 28, 2010|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091227190508/http://www.city.kagoshima.lg.jp/_1010/shimin/foreigner/foreigner-eng-1/0005357.html|archivedate = December 27, 2009}}</ref> with around 3,500 health insurers.

However, the copayment rates differed greatly. While those who enrolled in employees' health insurance needed to pay only a nominal amount at the first physician visit, their dependents and those who enrolled in National Health Insurance had to pay 50% of the fee schedule price for all services and medications. From 1961 to 1982, the copayment rate was gradually lowered to 30%.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ikegami|first=Naoki|title=Japanese universal health coverage: evolution, achievements, and challenges|journal=The Lancet|date=17 September 2011|volume=378|pages=1108|pmid=21885107|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60828-3|issue=9796}}</ref>\n\nSince 1983, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance.<ref name= \"\u8b1b\u8ac7\u793e\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30ca\u30b7\u30e7\u30ca\u30eb p. 183\">{{harvnb|\u8b1b\u8ac7\u793e\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30ca\u30b7\u30e7\u30ca\u30eb|2003|p=183}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1980s, government and professional circles were considering changing the system so that primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of care would be clearly distinguished within each geographical region. Further, facilities would be designated by level of care and referrals would be required to obtain more complex care. Policy makers and administrators also recognised the need to unify the various insurance systems and to control costs.\n\nBy the early 1990s, there were more than 1,000 [[mental hospital]]s, 8,700 general [[hospital]]s, and 1,000 comprehensive hospitals with a total capacity of 1.5 million beds.

The diet forces the body to burn fats rather than [[carbohydrate]]s. Normally, the carbohydrates contained in food are converted into [[glucose]], which is then transported around the body and is particularly important in [[Brain metabolism|fueling brain function]]. However, if little carbohydrate remains in the diet, the [[liver]] converts [[triacylglycerol|fat]] into [[fatty acid]]s and [[ketone bodies]]. The ketone bodies pass into the [[brain]] and replace glucose as an energy source. An elevated level of ketone bodies in the blood, a state known as [[ketosis]], leads to a reduction in the frequency of [[epileptic seizure]]s.<ref name=Freeman2007/> Around half of children and young people with epilepsy who have tried some form of this diet saw the number of [[Epileptic seizure|seizures]] drop by at least half, and the effect persists even after discontinuing the diet.<ref name=MartinMcGill2018/> Some evidence indicates that adults with epilepsy may benefit from the diet, and that a less strict regimen, such as a modified [[Atkins diet]], is similarly effective.<ref name=Freeman2007/> Potential side effects may include [[constipation]], [[Hypercholesterolemia|high cholesterol]], growth slowing, [[acidosis]], and [[Kidney stone disease|kidney stones]].<ref name=Kossoff2013/>\n\nThe original therapeutic diet for [[epilepsy in children|paediatric epilepsy]] provides just enough protein for body growth and repair, and sufficient [[food energy|calories]]<ref name=Units group=Note/> to maintain the correct weight for age and height. The classic therapeutic ketogenic diet was developed for treatment of paediatric epilepsy in the 1920s and was widely used into the next decade, but its popularity waned with the introduction of effective [[anticonvulsant]] medications. This classic ketogenic diet contains a 4:1  ratio by weight of fat to combined protein and carbohydrate. This is achieved by excluding high-carbohydrate foods such as starchy fruits and vegetables, bread, pasta, grains, and sugar, while increasing the consumption of foods high in fat such as nuts, cream, and butter.<ref name=Freeman2007/> Most dietary fat is made of molecules called long-chain triglycerides (LCTs). However, [[medium-chain triglyceride]]s (MCTs)\u2014made from fatty acids with shorter [[carbon chain]]s than LCTs\u2014are more ketogenic. A variant of the classic diet known as the MCT ketogenic diet uses a form of [[coconut oil]], which is rich in MCTs, to provide around half the calories. As less overall fat is needed in this variant of the diet, a greater proportion of carbohydrate and protein can be consumed, allowing a greater variety of food choices.<ref name=Liu2008/><ref name=Zupec-Kania2008a/>\n\nIn 1994, Hollywood producer [[Jim Abrahams]], whose son's severe epilepsy was effectively controlled by the diet, created the Charlie Foundation for Ketogenic Therapies to further promote diet therapy. Publicity included an appearance on NBC's [[Dateline NBC|''Dateline'']] program and ''[[...First Do No Harm]]'' (1997), a [[television movie|made-for-television film]] starring [[Meryl Streep]]. The foundation sponsored a research study, the results of which\u2014announced in 1996\u2014marked the beginning of renewed scientific interest in the diet.<ref name=Freeman2007/> \n\nPossible therapeutic uses for the ketogenic diet have been studied for many additional neurological disorders, some of which include: [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], headache, [[neurotrauma]], pain, [[Parkinson's disease]], and [[sleep disorder]]s.<ref name=Gano2014/>\n\n==Epilepsy==\n[[Epilepsy]] is one of the most common [[neurology|neurological]] disorders after [[stroke]],<ref name=Stafstrom2004/> affecting around 50&nbsp;million people worldwide.<ref name=deBoer2008/> It is diagnosed in a person having recurrent, unprovoked [[seizure]]s. These occur when [[cortex (anatomy)|cortical]] [[neuron]]s fire excessively, [[Hypersynchronization of electrophysiological activity in epilepsy|hypersynchronously]], or both, leading to temporary disruption of normal brain function. This might affect, for example, the muscles, the senses, consciousness, or a combination. A seizure can be [[focal seizure|focal]] (confined to a specific part of the brain) or [[generalised seizure|generalised]] (spread widely throughout the brain and leading to a loss of consciousness). Epilepsy can occur for a variety of reasons; some forms have been classified into epileptic [[syndrome]]s, most of which begin in childhood. Epilepsy is considered refractory (not yielding to treatment) when two or three [[anticonvulsant]] drugs have failed to control it. About 60% of patients achieve control of their epilepsy with the first drug they use, whereas around 30% do not achieve control with drugs. When drugs fail, other options include [[epilepsy surgery]], [[vagus nerve stimulation]], and the ketogenic diet.<ref name=Stafstrom2004/>\n\n==History==\nThe ketogenic diet is a [[Mainstream#In science|mainstream]] dietary therapy that was developed to reproduce the success and remove the limitations of the non-mainstream use of [[fasting]] to treat epilepsy.<ref name=Fasting group=Note/> Although popular in the 1920s and '30s, it was largely abandoned in favour of new anticonvulsant drugs.<ref name=Freeman2007/> Most individuals with epilepsy can successfully control their seizures with medication. However, 20\u201330% fail to achieve such control despite trying a number of different drugs.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> For this group, and for children in particular, the diet has once again found a role in epilepsy management.<ref name=Freeman2007/><ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\n===Fasting===\n[[File:Conklin Fasting - NewYorkTimes.png|thumb|alt=Scan of newspaper column. See image description page for full text.|A news report of Dr Hugh Conklin's \"water diet\" treatment from 1922]]\n\nPhysicians of [[ancient Greece]] treated diseases, including epilepsy, by altering their patients' diet. An early treatise in the [[Hippocratic Corpus]], ''[[On the Sacred Disease]]'', covers the disease; it  dates from {{circa|400 BC}}. Its author argued against the prevailing view that epilepsy was supernatural in origin and cure, and proposed that dietary therapy had a rational and physical basis.<ref name=Hippocrates1 group=Note/> In the same collection, the author of ''Epidemics'' describes the case of a man whose epilepsy is cured as quickly as it had appeared, through complete abstinence of food and drink.<ref name=Hippocrates2 group=Note/> The royal physician [[Erasistratus]] declared, \"One inclining to epilepsy should be made to fast without mercy and be put on short rations.\"<ref name=Galen1 group=Note/> [[Galen]] believed an \"attenuating diet\"<ref name=Galen2 group=Note/> might afford a cure in mild cases and be helpful in others.<ref name=Temkin1971/>\n\nThe first modern study of fasting as a treatment for epilepsy was in France in 1911.<ref name=Guelpa1911/> Twenty epilepsy patients of all ages were \"detoxified\" by consuming a low-calorie vegetarian diet, combined with periods of fasting and purging. Two benefited enormously, but most failed to maintain compliance with the imposed restrictions. The diet improved the patients' mental capabilities, in contrast to their medication, [[potassium bromide]], which dulled the mind.<ref name=Bailey2005/>\n\nAround this time, [[Bernarr Macfadden]], an American exponent of [[physical culture]], popularised the use of fasting to restore health. His disciple, the [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic physician]] Dr. Hugh William Conklin of [[Battle Creek, Michigan]], began to treat his epilepsy patients by recommending fasting. Conklin conjectured that epileptic seizures were caused when a toxin, secreted from the [[Peyer's patches]] in the intestines, was discharged into the bloodstream. He recommended a fast lasting 18 to 25&nbsp;days to allow this toxin to dissipate. Conklin probably treated hundreds of epilepsy patients with his \"water diet\" and boasted of a 90% cure rate in children, falling to 50% in adults. Later analysis of Conklin's case records showed 20% of his patients achieved freedom from seizures and 50% had some improvement.<ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\nConklin's fasting therapy was adopted by [[neurology|neurologists]] in mainstream practice. In 1916, a Dr McMurray wrote to the ''New York Medical Journal'' claiming to have successfully treated epilepsy patients with a fast, followed by a starch- and sugar-free diet, since 1912. In 1921, prominent [[endocrinology|endocrinologist]] Henry Rawle Geyelin reported his experiences to the [[American Medical Association]] convention. He had seen Conklin's success first-hand and had attempted to reproduce the results in 36 of his own patients. He achieved similar results despite having studied the patients for only a short time. Further studies in the 1920s indicated that seizures generally returned after the fast. [[Charles P. Howland]], the parent of one of Conklin's successful patients and a wealthy New York corporate lawyer, gave his brother John Elias Howland a gift of $5,000 to study \"the ketosis of starvation\". As professor of paediatrics at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]], John E. Howland used the money to fund research undertaken by neurologist [[Stanley Cobb]] and his assistant [[William G. Lennox]].<ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\n===Diet===\nIn 1921, Rollin Turner Woodyatt reviewed the research on diet and [[diabetes]]. He reported that three water-soluble compounds, [[beta-Hydroxybutyric acid|\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate]], [[acetoacetate]], and [[acetone]] (known collectively as [[ketone bodies]]), were produced by the liver in otherwise healthy people when they were starved or if they consumed a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet.<ref name=Wheless2004/> Dr. Russell Morse Wilder, at the [[Mayo Clinic]], built on this research and coined the term \"ketogenic diet\" to describe a diet that produced a high level of ketone bodies in the blood ([[ketonemia]]) through an excess of fat and lack of carbohydrate. Wilder hoped to obtain the benefits of fasting in a dietary therapy that could be maintained indefinitely. His trial on a few epilepsy patients in 1921 was the first use of the ketogenic diet as a treatment for epilepsy.<ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\nWilder's colleague, paediatrician Mynie Gustav Peterman, later formulated the classic diet, with a ratio of one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight in children, 10\u201315&nbsp;g of carbohydrate per day, and the remainder of calories from fat. Peterman's work in the 1920s established the techniques for induction and maintenance of the diet. Peterman documented positive effects (improved alertness, behaviour, and sleep) and adverse effects (nausea and vomiting due to excess ketosis). The diet proved to be very successful in children: Peterman reported in 1925 that 95% of 37 young patients had improved seizure control on the diet and 60% became seizure-free. By 1930, the diet had also been studied in 100 teenagers and adults. Clifford Joseph Barborka, Sr., also from the Mayo Clinic, reported that 56% of those older patients improved on the diet and 12% became seizure-free. Although the adult results are similar to modern studies of children, they did not compare as well to contemporary studies. Barborka concluded that adults were least likely to benefit from the diet, and the use of the ketogenic diet in adults was not studied again until 1999.<ref name=Wheless2004/><ref name=Kossoff2007/>\n\n===Anticonvulsants and decline===\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, when the only anticonvulsant drugs were the sedative [[Potassium bromide|bromides]] (discovered 1857) and [[phenobarbital]] (1912), the ketogenic diet was widely used and studied. This changed in 1938 when [[H. Houston Merritt|H. Houston Merritt, Jr.]] and [[Tracy Putnam]] discovered [[phenytoin]] (Dilantin), and the focus of research shifted to discovering new drugs. With the introduction of [[sodium valproate]] in the 1970s, drugs were available to neurologists that were effective across a broad range of epileptic syndromes and seizure types. The use of the ketogenic diet, by this time restricted to difficult cases such as [[Lennox\u2013Gastaut syndrome]], declined further.<ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\n===MCT diet===\n[[File:Liquigen edit.jpg|thumb|alt=A glass bottle of 250 ml of Liquigen, a white opaque liquid|[[Medium-chain triglyceride]] (MCT) oil emulsion]]\nIn the 1960s,  [[medium-chain triglyceride]]s (MCTs) were found to produce more ketone bodies per unit of energy than normal dietary fats (which are mostly long-chain triglycerides).<ref name=Huttenlocher1971/> MCTs are more efficiently absorbed and are rapidly transported to the liver via the [[hepatic portal system]] rather than the [[lymphatic system]].<ref name=Neal2008/> The severe carbohydrate restrictions of the classic ketogenic diet made it difficult for parents to produce palatable meals that their children would tolerate. In 1971, [[Peter Huttenlocher]] devised a ketogenic diet where about 60% of the calories came from the MCT oil, and this allowed more protein and up to three times as much carbohydrate as the classic ketogenic diet. The oil was mixed with at least twice its volume of skimmed milk, chilled, and sipped during the meal or incorporated into food. He tested it on 12 children and adolescents with intractable seizures. Most children improved in both seizure control and alertness, results that were similar to the classic ketogenic diet. Gastrointestinal upset was a problem, which led one patient to abandon the diet, but meals were easier to prepare and better accepted by the children.<ref name=Huttenlocher1971/> The MCT diet replaced the classic ketogenic diet in many hospitals, though some devised diets that were a combination of the two.<ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\n===Revival===\nThe ketogenic diet achieved national media exposure in the US in October 1994, when NBC's [[Dateline NBC|''Dateline'']] television programme reported the case of Charlie Abrahams, son of Hollywood producer [[Jim Abrahams]]. The two-year-old suffered from epilepsy that had remained uncontrolled by mainstream and alternative therapies. Abrahams discovered a reference to the ketogenic diet in an epilepsy guide for parents and brought Charlie to [[John M. Freeman (neurologist)|John M. Freeman]] at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]], which had continued to offer the therapy. Under the diet, Charlie's epilepsy was rapidly controlled and his developmental progress resumed. This inspired Abrahams to create the Charlie Foundation to promote the diet and fund research.<ref name=Wheless2004/> A multicentre prospective study began in 1994, the results were presented to the American Epilepsy Society in 1996 and were published<ref name=Vining1998/> in 1998. There followed an explosion of scientific interest in the diet. In 1997, Abrahams produced a TV movie, ''[[...First Do No Harm]]'', starring Meryl Streep, in which a young boy's intractable epilepsy is successfully treated by the ketogenic diet.<ref name=Freeman2007/>\n\nBy 2007, the ketogenic diet was available from around 75 centres in 45 countries, and less restrictive variants, such as the modified Atkins diet, were in use, particularly among older children and adults. The ketogenic diet was also under investigation for the treatment of a wide variety of disorders other than epilepsy.<ref name=Freeman2007/>\n\n==Efficacy==\nThe ketogenic diet reduces seizure frequency by more than 50% in half of the patients who try it and by more than 90% in a third of patients.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> Three-quarters of children who respond do so within two weeks, though experts recommend a trial of at least three months before assuming it has been ineffective.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> Children with refractory epilepsy are more likely to benefit from the ketogenic diet than from trying another anticonvulsant drug.<ref name=Freeman2007/> Some evidence indicates that adolescents and adults may also benefit from the diet.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\n===Trial design===\nEarly studies reported high success rates; in one study in 1925, 60% of patients became seizure-free, and another 35% of patients had a 50% reduction in seizure frequency. These studies generally examined a [[Cohort study|cohort]] of patients recently treated by the physician (a [[retrospective study]]) and selected patients who had successfully maintained the dietary restrictions. However, these studies are difficult to compare to modern trials. One reason is that these older trials suffered from [[selection bias]], as they excluded patients who were unable to start or maintain the diet and thereby selected from patients who would generate better results. In an attempt to control for this bias, modern study design prefers a [[prospective cohort study|prospective cohort]] (the patients in the study are chosen before therapy begins) in which the results are presented for all patients regardless of whether they started or completed the treatment (known as [[Intention to treat analysis|intent-to-treat analysis]]).<ref name=Hartman2007b/>\n\nAnother difference between older and newer studies is that the type of patients treated with the ketogenic diet has changed over time. When first developed and used, the ketogenic diet was not a treatment of last resort; in contrast, the children in modern studies have already tried and failed a number of anticonvulsant drugs, so may be assumed to have more difficult-to-treat epilepsy. Early and modern studies also differ because the treatment [[Protocol (natural sciences)|protocol]] has changed. In older protocols, the diet was initiated with a prolonged [[fasting|fast]], designed to lose 5\u201310% [[body weight]], and heavily restricted the calorie intake. Concerns over child health and growth led to a relaxation of the diet's restrictions.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> Fluid restriction was once a feature of the diet, but this led to increased risk of constipation and kidney stones, and is no longer considered beneficial.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\n===Outcomes===\nA study with an intent-to-treat prospective design was published in 1998 by a team from the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]]<ref name=Freeman1998/> and followed-up by a report published in 2001.<ref name=Hemingway2001/> As with most studies of the ketogenic diet,  no [[control group]] (patients who did not receive the treatment) was used. The study enrolled 150 children. After three months, 83% of them were still on the diet, 26% had experienced a good reduction in seizures, 31% had had an excellent reduction, and 3% were seizure-free.<ref name=Reduction group=Note/> At 12 months, 55% were still on the diet, 23% had a good response, 20% had an excellent response, and 7% were seizure-free. Those who had discontinued the diet by this stage did so because it was ineffective, too restrictive, or due to illness, and most of those who remained were benefiting from it. The percentage of those still on the diet at two, three, and four years was 39%, 20%, and 12%, respectively. During this period, the most common reason for discontinuing the diet was because the children had become seizure-free or significantly better. At four years, 16% of the original 150 children had a good reduction in seizure frequency, 14% had an excellent reduction, and 13% were seizure-free, though these figures include many who were no longer on the diet. Those remaining on the diet after this duration were typically not seizure-free, but had had an excellent response.<ref name=Hemingway2001/><ref name=Kossoff2009c/>\n\nIt is possible to combine the results of several small studies to produce evidence that is stronger than that available from each study alone\u2014a statistical method known as [[meta-analysis]]. One of four such analyses, conducted in 2006, looked at 19 studies on a total of 1,084 patients.<ref name=Henderson2006/> It concluded that a third achieved an excellent reduction in seizure frequency and half the patients achieved a good reduction.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\nA [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane]] systematic review in 2018 found and analysed eleven randomized controlled trials of ketogenic diet in people with epilepsy for whom drugs failed to control their seizures.<ref name=MartinMcGill2018/> Six of the trials compared a group assigned to a ketogenic diet with a group not assigned to one. The other trials compared types of diets or ways of introducing them to make them more tolerable.<ref name=MartinMcGill2018/> In the largest trial of the ketogenic diet with a non-diet control<ref name=Neal2008 />, nearly 38% of the children and young people had half or fewer seizures with the diet compared 6% with the group not assigned to the diet. Two large trials of the Modified Atkins Diet compared to a non-diet control had similar results, with over 50% of children having half or fewer seizures with the diet compared to around 10% in the control group.<ref name=MartinMcGill2018/>\n\nA systematic review in 2018 looked at 16 studies on the ketogenic diet in adults. It concluded that the treatment was becoming more popular for that group of patients, that the efficacy in adults was similar to children, the side effects relatively mild. However, many patients gave up with the diet, for various reasons, and the quality of evidence was inferior to studies on children. Health issues include high levels of [[low-density lipoprotein]], high total [[cholesterol]], and [[weight loss]].<ref name=Liu2018/>\n\n==Indications and contraindications==\n[[File:Anticonvulsants.jpg|thumb|alt=Anticonvulsants|Experts on the ketogenic diet recommend it be strongly considered for children with uncontrolled epilepsy who have tried and failed two or three anticonvulsant drugs;<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> most children who start the ketogenic diet have failed at least three times this number.<ref name=Bergqvist2004/>]]\nThe ketogenic diet is indicated as an adjunctive (additional) treatment in children and young people with [[drug-resistant epilepsy]].<ref name=NICE/><ref name=SIGN/> It is approved by national [[Medical guideline|clinical guidelines]] in Scotland,<ref name=SIGN/> England, and Wales<ref name=NICE/> and reimbursed by nearly all US insurance companies.<ref name=Turner2006/> Children with a focal [[lesion]] (a single point of brain abnormality causing the epilepsy) who would make suitable candidates for [[epilepsy surgery|surgery]] are more likely to become seizure-free with surgery than with the ketogenic diet.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/><ref name=Stainman2007/> About a third of epilepsy centres that offer the ketogenic diet also offer a dietary therapy to adults. Some clinicians consider the two less restrictive dietary variants\u2014the low [[glycaemic index]] treatment and the modified Atkins diet\u2014to be more appropriate for adolescents and adults.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> A liquid form of the ketogenic diet is particularly easy to prepare for, and well tolerated by, infants on formula and children who are [[feeding tube|tube-fed]].<ref name=Zupec-Kania2008a/><ref name=Kossoff2004b/>\n\nAdvocates for the diet recommend that it be seriously considered after two medications have failed, as the chance of other drugs succeeding is only 10%.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/><ref name=Kossoff2004a/><ref name=Spendiff2008/> The diet can be considered earlier for some epilepsy and genetic syndromes where it has shown particular usefulness. These include [[Dravet syndrome]], [[infantile spasms]], [[myoclonic-astatic epilepsy]], and [[tuberous sclerosis complex]].<ref name=Kossoff2009a/><ref name=Wang2014/>\n\nA survey in 2005 of 88 paediatric neurologists in the US found that 36% regularly prescribed the diet after three or more drugs had failed, 24% occasionally prescribed the diet as a last resort, 24% had only prescribed the diet in a few rare cases, and 16% had never prescribed the diet. Several possible explanations exist for this gap between [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence]] and clinical practice.<ref name=Mastriani2008/> One major factor may be the lack of adequately trained [[dietitian]]s who are needed to administer a ketogenic diet programme.<ref name=Kossoff2004a/>\n\nBecause the ketogenic diet alters the body's metabolism, it is a [[first-line therapy]] in children with certain [[congenital metabolic disease]]s such as [[Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency|pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) deficiency]] and [[De Vivo disease|glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome]],<ref name=Wang2018/> which prevent the body from using carbohydrates as fuel, leading to a dependency on ketone bodies. The ketogenic diet is beneficial in treating the seizures and some other symptoms in these diseases and is an absolute indication.<ref name=Huffman2006/> However, it is absolutely [[contraindication|contraindicated]] in the treatment of other diseases such as [[pyruvate carboxylase deficiency]], [[porphyria]], and other rare [[Inborn errors of lipid metabolism|genetic disorders of fat metabolism]].<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> Persons with a disorder of fatty acid oxidation are unable to metabolise fatty acids, which replace carbohydrates as the major energy source on the diet. On the ketogenic diet, their bodies would consume their own protein stores for fuel, leading to [[ketoacidosis]], and eventually coma and death.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2004/>\n\n==Interactions==\nThe ketogenic diet is usually initiated in combination with the patient's existing anticonvulsant regimen, though patients may be weaned off anticonvulsants if the diet is successful. Some evidence of synergistic benefits is seen when the diet is combined with the [[vagus nerve stimulation|vagus nerve stimulator]] or with the drug [[zonisamide]], and that the diet may be less successful in children receiving [[phenobarbital]].<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\n==Adverse effects==\nThe ketogenic diet is not considered a [[Benignity|benign]], holistic, or all-natural treatment. As with any serious medical therapy, it may result in complications, although these are generally less severe and less frequent than with anticonvulsant medication or surgery.<ref name=Turner2006/> Common but easily treatable short-term side effects include [[constipation]], low-grade [[acidosis]], and [[hypoglycaemia]] if an initial fast is undertaken. [[Hyperlipidemia|Raised levels of lipids in the blood]] affect up to 60% of children<ref name=Bergqvist2011/> and [[Hypercholesterolemia|cholesterol levels may increase]] by around 30%.<ref name=Turner2006/> This can be treated by changes to the fat content of the diet, such as from saturated fats towards polyunsaturated fats, and if persistent, by lowering the ketogenic ratio.<ref name=Bergqvist2011/> Supplements are necessary to counter the dietary deficiency of many [[micronutrient]]s.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\nLong-term use of the ketogenic diet in children increases the risk of slowed or stunted growth, bone fractures, and [[kidney stone]]s.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> The diet reduces levels of [[insulin-like growth factor 1]], which is important for childhood growth. Like many anticonvulsant drugs, the ketogenic diet has an adverse effect on bone health. Many factors may be involved such as acidosis and suppressed growth hormone.<ref name=Bergqvist2011/> About one in 20 children on the ketogenic diet develop kidney stones (compared with one in several thousand for the general population). A class of anticonvulsants known as [[carbonic anhydrase inhibitors]] ([[topiramate]], [[zonisamide]]) are known to increase the risk of kidney stones, but the combination of these anticonvulsants and the ketogenic diet does not appear to elevate the risk above that of the diet alone.<ref name=Sampath2007/> The stones are treatable and do not justify discontinuation of the diet.<ref name=Sampath2007/> Johns Hopkins Hospital now gives oral [[potassium citrate]] supplements to all ketogenic diet patients, resulting in one-seventh of the incidence of kidney stones.<ref name=McNally2009/> However, this empiric usage has not been tested in a prospective controlled trial.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> Kidney stone formation (nephrolithiasis) is associated with the diet for four reasons:<ref name=Sampath2007/>\n* Excess calcium in the urine ([[hypercalciuria]]) occurs due to increased bone demineralisation with acidosis. Bones are mainly composed of [[calcium phosphate]]. The phosphate reacts with the acid, and the calcium is excreted by the kidneys.<ref name=Sampath2007/>\n* Hypocitraturia: the urine has an abnormally low concentration of citrate, which normally helps to dissolve free calcium.<ref name=Sampath2007/>\n* The urine has a low pH, which stops [[uric acid]] from dissolving, leading to crystals that act as a [[wikt:nidus|nidus]] for calcium stone formation.<ref name=Sampath2007/>\n* Many institutions traditionally restricted the water intake of patients on the diet to 80% of normal daily needs;<ref name=Sampath2007/> this practice is no longer encouraged.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\nIn adolescent and adults, common side effects reported include weight loss, constipation, [[dyslipidemia]], and in women, [[dysmenorrhea]].<ref name=Kossoff2006/>\n\n==Implementation==\nThe ketogenic diet is a [[medical nutrition therapy]] that involves participants from various disciplines. Team members include a registered paediatric [[dietitian]] who coordinates the diet programme; a paediatric [[neurologist]] who is experienced in offering the ketogenic diet; and a [[registered nurse]] who is familiar with childhood epilepsy. Additional help may come from a [[medical social worker]] who works with the family and a [[pharmacist]] who can advise on the carbohydrate content of medicines. Lastly, the parents and other caregivers must be educated in many aspects of the diet for it to be safely implemented.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2008a/>\n\nImplementing the diet can present difficulties for caregivers and the patient due to the time commitment involved in measuring and planning meals. Since any unplanned eating can potentially break the nutritional balance required, some people find the discipline needed to maintain the diet challenging and unpleasant. Some people terminate the diet or switch to a less demanding diet, like the modified Atkins diet or the low-glycaemic index treatment diet, because they find the difficulties too great.<ref name=Vogelstein2010/>\n\n===Initiation===\nThe Johns Hopkins Hospital protocol for initiating the ketogenic diet has been widely adopted.<ref name=Kim2008/> It involves a consultation with the patient and their caregivers and, later, a short hospital admission.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> Because of the risk of complications during ketogenic diet initiation, most centres begin the diet under close medical supervision in the hospital.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\nAt the initial consultation, patients are [[screening (medicine)|screened]] for conditions that may [[contraindicate]] the diet. A dietary [[medical history|history]] is obtained and the parameters of the diet selected: the ketogenic ratio of fat to combined protein and carbohydrate, the calorie requirements and the fluid intake.<ref name=Hartman2007b/>\n\nThe day before admission to hospital, the proportion of carbohydrate in the diet may be decreased and the patient begins fasting after his or her evening meal.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> On admission, only calorie- and caffeine-free fluids<ref name=Zupec-Kania2004/> are allowed until dinner, which consists of \"[[eggnog]]\"<ref name=Eggnog group=Note/> restricted to one-third of the typical calories for a meal. The following breakfast and lunch are similar, and on the second day, the \"eggnog\" dinner is increased to two-thirds of a typical meal's caloric content. By the third day, dinner contains the full calorie quota and is a standard ketogenic meal (not \"eggnog\"). After a ketogenic breakfast on the fourth day, the patient is discharged. Where possible, the patient's current medicines are changed to carbohydrate-free formulations.<ref name=Hartman2007b/>\n\nWhen in the hospital, [[blood sugar|glucose levels]] are checked several times daily and the patient is monitored for signs of symptomatic [[ketosis]] (which can be treated with a small quantity of orange juice). Lack of energy and lethargy are common, but disappear within two weeks.<ref name=Vining1998/> The parents attend classes over the first three full days, which cover nutrition, managing the diet, preparing meals, avoiding sugar, and handling illness.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> The level of parental education and commitment required is higher than with medication.<ref name=Kossoff2008a/>\n\nVariations on the Johns Hopkins protocol are common. The initiation can be performed using [[outpatient]] clinics rather than requiring a stay in hospital. Often, no initial fast is used (fasting increases the risk of [[metabolic acidosis|acidosis]], hypoglycaemia, and weight loss). Rather than increasing meal sizes over the three-day initiation, some institutions maintain meal size, but alter the ketogenic ratio from 2:1 to 4:1.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\nFor patients who benefit, half achieve a seizure reduction within five days (if the diet starts with an initial fast of one to two days), three-quarters achieve a reduction within two weeks, and 90% achieve a reduction within 23 days. If the diet does not begin with a fast, the time for half of the patients to achieve an improvement is longer (two weeks), but the long-term seizure reduction rates are unaffected.<ref name=Kossoff2008a/> Parents are encouraged to persist with the diet for at least three months before any final consideration is made regarding efficacy.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\n===Maintenance===\nAfter initiation, the child regularly visits the hospital outpatient clinic where they are seen by the dietitian and neurologist, and various tests and examinations are performed. These are held every three months for the first year and then every six months thereafter. Infants under one year old are seen more frequently, with the initial visit held after just two to four weeks.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> A period of minor adjustments is necessary to ensure consistent ketosis is maintained and to better adapt the meal plans to the patient. This fine-tuning is typically done over the telephone with the hospital [[dietitian]]<ref name=Hartman2007b/> and includes changing the number of calories, altering the ketogenic ratio, or adding some MCT or coconut oils to a classic diet.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> [[ketonuria|Urinary ketone levels]] are checked daily to detect whether ketosis has been achieved and to confirm that the patient is following the diet, though the level of ketones does not correlate with an anticonvulsant effect.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> This is performed using ketone test strips containing [[nitroprusside]], which change colour from buff-pink to maroon in the presence of acetoacetate (one of the three ketone bodies).<ref name=Musa-Veloso2004/>\n\nA short-lived increase in seizure frequency may occur during illness or if [[ketone]] levels fluctuate. The diet may be modified if seizure frequency remains high, or the child is losing weight.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> Loss of seizure-control may come from unexpected sources. Even \"sugar-free\" food can contain carbohydrates such as [[maltodextrin]], [[sorbitol]], [[starch]], and [[fructose]]. The sorbitol content of suntan lotion and other skincare products may be high enough for some to be absorbed through the skin and thus negate ketosis.<ref name=Kossoff2004a/>\n\n===Discontinuation===\nAbout 20% of children on the ketogenic diet achieve freedom from seizures, and many are able to reduce the use of anticonvulsant drugs or eliminate them altogether.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> Commonly, at around two years on the diet, or after six months of being seizure-free, the diet may be gradually discontinued over two or three months. This is done by lowering the ketogenic ratio until urinary ketosis is no longer detected, and then lifting all calorie restrictions.<ref name=Martinez2007/> This timing and method of discontinuation mimics that of anticonvulsant drug therapy in children, where the child has become seizure-free. When the diet is required to treat certain metabolic diseases, the duration will be longer. The total diet duration is up to the treating ketogenic diet team and parents; durations up to 12 years have been studied and found beneficial.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\nChildren who discontinue the diet after achieving seizure freedom have about a 20% risk of seizures returning. The length of time until recurrence is highly variable, but averages two years. This risk of recurrence compares with 10% for resective surgery (where part of the brain is removed) and 30\u201350% for anticonvulsant therapy. Of those who have a recurrence, just over half can regain freedom from seizures either with anticonvulsants or by returning to the ketogenic diet. Recurrence is more likely if, despite seizure freedom, an [[electroencephalogram]]  shows epileptiform spikes, which indicate epileptic activity in the brain but are below the level that will cause a seizure. Recurrence is also likely if an [[MRI scan]] shows focal abnormalities (for example, as in children with [[tuberous sclerosis]]). Such children may remain on the diet longer than average, and children with tuberous sclerosis who achieve seizure freedom could remain on the ketogenic diet indefinitely.<ref name=Martinez2007/>\n\n==Variants==\n\n===Classic===\n[[File:Ketogenic diets pie MCT.svg|thumb|alt=A series of four pie charts for the typical American diet, the induction phase of the Atkins diet, the classic ketogenic diet, and the MCD ketogenic diet. The typical American diet has about half its calories from carbohydrates, where the others have very little carbohydrate. The Atkins diet is higher in protein than the others. Most of the fat in the MCT diet comes from MCT oil.|The ratio of calorific contributions from food components of four diets, by weight]]\n\nThe ketogenic diet is calculated by a [[dietitian]] for each child. Age, weight, activity levels, culture, and food preferences all affect the meal plan. First, the energy requirements are set at 80\u201390% of the recommended daily amounts (RDA) for the child's age (the high-fat diet requires less energy to process than a typical high-carbohydrate diet). Highly active children or those with muscle [[spasticity]] require more food energy than this; immobile children require less. The ketogenic ratio of the diet compares the weight of fat to the combined weight of carbohydrate and protein. This is typically 4:1, but children who are younger than 18&nbsp;months, older than 12&nbsp;years, or who are obese may be started on a 3:1 ratio. Fat is energy-rich, with 9&nbsp;kcal/g (38&nbsp;kJ/g) compared to 4&nbsp;kcal/g (17&nbsp;kJ/g) for carbohydrate or protein, so portions on the ketogenic diet are smaller than normal. The quantity of fat in the diet can be calculated from the overall energy requirements and the chosen ketogenic ratio. Next, the protein levels are set to allow for growth and body maintenance, and are around 1&nbsp;g protein for each kg of body weight. Lastly, the amount of carbohydrate is set according to what allowance is left while maintaining the chosen ratio. Any carbohydrate in medications or [[dietary supplement|supplements]] must be subtracted from this allowance. The total daily amount of fat, protein, and carbohydrate is then evenly divided across the meals.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2004/>\n\nA computer program such as KetoCalculator may be used to help generate recipes.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2008b/> The meals often have four components: [[cream|heavy whipping cream]], a protein-rich food (typically meat), a fruit or vegetable and a fat such as butter, vegetable oil, or mayonnaise. Only low-carbohydrate fruits and vegetables are allowed, which excludes bananas, potatoes, peas, and corn. Suitable fruits are divided into two groups based on the amount of carbohydrate they contain, and vegetables are similarly divided into two groups. Foods within each of these four groups may be freely substituted to allow for variation without needing to recalculate portion sizes. For example, cooked broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and green beans are all equivalent. Fresh, canned, or frozen foods are equivalent, but raw and cooked vegetables differ, and processed foods are an additional complication. Parents are required to be precise when measuring food quantities on an electronic [[weighing scale|scale]] accurate to 1&nbsp;g. The child must eat the whole meal and cannot have extra portions; any snacks must be incorporated into the meal plan. A small amount of MCT oil may be used to help with constipation or to increase ketosis.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2004/>\n\nThe classic ketogenic diet is not a [[balanced diet]] and only contains tiny portions of fresh fruit and vegetables, [[Food fortification|fortified]] cereals, and calcium-rich foods. In particular, the [[B vitamins]], [[calcium]], and [[vitamin D]] must be artificially supplemented. This is achieved by taking two sugar-free supplements designed for the patient's age: a [[multivitamin]] with [[Dietary mineral|minerals]] and [[calcium]] with vitamin D.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> A typical day of food for a child on a 4:1 ratio, 1,500&nbsp;kcal (6,300&nbsp;kJ) ketogenic diet comprises three small meals and three small snacks:<ref name=Turner2006/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Sample meal plan for one day\n!Meal\n!Menu idea\n!Ingredients\n|-\n|Breakfast\n|Egg with bacon\n|\n* 28&nbsp;g egg (about half an egg)\n* 11&nbsp;g bacon (about half a slice)\n* 37&nbsp;g of 36% heavy whipping cream\n* 23&nbsp;g butter\n* 9&nbsp;g slice of apple (about 5% of one apple)\n|-\n|Morning snack\n|Peanut butter ball\n(serving size: 0.5&nbsp;ounce)\n|\n* 6&nbsp;g peanut butter\n* 9&nbsp;g butter\n|-\n|Lunch\n|Tuna salad\n|\n* 28&nbsp;g tuna fish\n* 30&nbsp;g mayonnaise\n* 10&nbsp;g celery\n* 36&nbsp;g of 36% heavy whipping cream\n* 15&nbsp;g lettuce (one large leaf)\n|-\n|Afternoon snack\n|Keto yogurt\n(serving size: 1.3&nbsp;ounces)\n|\n* 18&nbsp;g of 36% heavy whipping cream\n* 17&nbsp;g sour cream\n* 4&nbsp;g strawberries (about half of one small strawberry)\n* [[artificial sweetener]]\n|-\n|Dinner\n|Cheeseburger (no bun)\n|\n* 22&nbsp;g [[Ground beef|minced (ground) beef]]\n* 10&nbsp;g [[American cheese]] (half a slice of cheese)\n* 26&nbsp;g butter\n* 38&nbsp;g of 36% heavy whipping cream\n* 10&nbsp;g lettuce (one medium leaf)\n* 11&nbsp;g green beans (one spoonful)\n|-\n|Evening snack\n|Keto custard\n(serving size: 1.2&nbsp;ounces)\n|\n* 25&nbsp;g of 36% heavy whipping cream\n* 9&nbsp;g egg (half a [[tablespoon]])\n* Pure, unsweetened vanilla flavouring\n|}\n\n===MCT oil===\nNormal dietary fat contains mostly long-chain triglycerides (LCTs). [[Medium-chain triglycerides]] (MCTs) are more ketogenic than LCTs because they generate more ketones per unit of energy when metabolised. Their use allows for a diet with a lower proportion of fat and a greater proportion of protein and carbohydrate,<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> leading to more food choices and larger portion sizes.<ref name=Liu2008/> The original MCT diet developed by Peter Huttenlocher in the 1970s derived 60% of its calories from MCT oil.<ref name=Huttenlocher1971/> Consuming that quantity of MCT oil caused abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and vomiting in some children. A figure of 45% is regarded as a balance between achieving good ketosis and minimising gastrointestinal complaints. The classical and modified MCT ketogenic diets are equally effective and differences in tolerability are not statistically significant.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> The MCT diet is less popular in the United States; MCT oil is more expensive than other dietary fats and is not covered by [[health insurance|insurance companies]].<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\n===Modified Atkins===\nFirst reported in 2003, the idea of using a form of the Atkins diet to treat epilepsy came about after parents and patients discovered that the induction phase of the Atkins diet controlled seizures. The ketogenic diet team at Johns Hopkins Hospital modified the Atkins diet by removing the aim of achieving weight loss, extending the induction phase indefinitely, and specifically encouraging fat consumption. Compared with the ketogenic diet, the modified Atkins diet (MAD) places no limit on calories or protein, and the lower overall ketogenic ratio (about 1:1) does not need to be consistently maintained by all meals of the day. The MAD does not begin with a fast or with a stay in hospital and requires less dietitian support than the ketogenic diet. Carbohydrates are initially limited to 10&nbsp;g per day in children or 20&nbsp;g per day in adults, and are increased to 20\u201330&nbsp;g per day after a month or so, depending on the effect on seizure control or tolerance of the restrictions. Like the ketogenic diet, the MAD requires vitamin and mineral supplements and children are carefully and periodically monitored at outpatient clinics.<ref name=Kossoff2008c/>\n\nThe modified Atkins diet reduces seizure frequency by more than 50% in 43% of patients who try it and by more than 90% in 27% of patients.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> Few adverse effects have been reported, though cholesterol is increased and the diet has not been studied long term.<ref name=Kossoff2008c/> Although based on a smaller data set (126 adults and children from 11 studies over five centres), these results from 2009 compare favorably with the traditional ketogenic diet.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\n===Low glycemic index treatment===\nThe low glycemic index treatment (LGIT)<ref name=Pfeifer2013/> is an attempt to achieve the stable [[blood glucose]] levels seen in children on the classic ketogenic diet while using a much less restrictive regimen. The hypothesis is that stable blood glucose may be one of the mechanisms of action involved in the ketogenic diet,<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> which occurs because the absorption of the limited carbohydrates is slowed by the high fat content.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2008a/> Although it is also a high-fat diet (with approximately 60% calories from fat),<ref name=Zupec-Kania2008a/> the LGIT allows more carbohydrate than either the classic ketogenic diet or the modified Atkins diet, approximately 40\u201360&nbsp;g per day.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> However, the types of carbohydrates consumed are restricted to those that have a glycaemic index lower than 50. Like the modified Atkins diet, the LGIT is initiated and maintained at outpatient clinics and does not require precise weighing of food or intensive dietitian support. Both are offered at most centres that run ketogenic diet programmes, and in some centres they are often the primary dietary therapy for adolescents.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\nShort-term results for the LGIT indicate that at one month approximately half of the patients experience a greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency, with overall figures approaching that of the ketogenic diet. The data (coming from one centre's experience with 76 children up to the year 2009) also indicate fewer side effects than the ketogenic diet and that it is better tolerated, with more palatable meals.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/><ref name=Muzykewicz2009/>\n\n===Prescribed formulations===\n[[File:Measuring Ketocal.jpg|thumb|alt=A cream-coloured powder is poured from a tin into a measuring jug on an electronic kitchen scale.|Measuring KetoCal\u2014a powdered formula for administering the classic ketogenic diet]]\nInfants and patients fed via a [[Feeding tube|gastrostomy tube]] can also be given a ketogenic diet. Parents make up a [[Medical prescription|prescribed]] powdered formula, such as KetoCal, into a liquid feed.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> Gastrostomy feeding avoids any issues with palatability, and bottle-fed infants readily accept the ketogenic formula.<ref name=Kossoff2004a/> Some studies have found this liquid feed to be more efficacious and associated with lower total [[cholesterol]] than a solid ketogenic diet.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> KetoCal is a [[Enteral formula|nutritionally complete food]] containing milk protein and is supplemented with amino acids, fat, carbohydrate, vitamins, minerals and trace elements. It is used to administer the 4:1 ratio classic ketogenic diet in children over one year. The formula is available in both 3:1 and 4:1 ratios, either unflavoured or in an artificially sweetened vanilla flavour and is suitable for tube or oral feeding.<ref name=KetoCal/> Other formula products include KetoVolve<ref name=KetoVolve/> and Ketonia.<ref name=KetoBottle/> Alternatively, a liquid ketogenic diet may be produced by combining Ross Carbohydrate Free soy formula with Microlipid and Polycose.<ref name=KetoBottle/>\n\n===Worldwide===\nThere are theoretically no restrictions on where the ketogenic diet might be used, and it can cost less than modern anticonvulsants. However, fasting and dietary changes are affected by religious and cultural issues. A culture where food is often prepared by grandparents or hired help means more people must be educated about the diet. When families dine together, sharing the same meal, it can be difficult to separate the child's meal. In many countries, food labelling is not mandatory, so calculating macronutrients such as fat, protein and carbohydrates can be difficult. In some countries, it may be hard to find sugar-free forms of medicines and supplements, to purchase an accurate electronic scale, or to afford MCT oils.<ref name=Kossoff2005/>\n\nIn Asia, the traditional diet includes rice and noodles as the main source of energy, making their elimination difficult. Therefore, the MCT-oil form of the diet, which allows more carbohydrate, has proved useful. In India, religious beliefs commonly affect the diet: some patients are vegetarians and will not eat root vegetables and will try to avoid beef. The Indian ketogenic diet is started without a fast due to cultural opposition towards fasting in children. The low-fat, high-carbohydrate nature of the normal Indian and Asian diet means that their ketogenic diets typically have a lower ketogenic ratio (1:1) than in America and Europe. However, they appear to be just as effective.<ref name=Kossoff2005/>\n\nIn many developing countries, the ketogenic diet is expensive because dairy fats and meat are more expensive than grain, fruit and vegetables. The modified Atkins diet has been proposed as a lower-cost alternative for those countries; the slightly more expensive food bill can be offset by a reduction in pharmaceutical costs if the diet is successful. The modified Atkins diet is less complex to explain and prepare and requires less support from a dietitian.<ref name=Kossoff2008b/>\n\n==Mechanism of action==\n\n===Seizure pathology===\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | header = [[Ketone bodies]]\n\n | image1 = beta-Hydroxybutyric acid-2D-skeletal.svg\n | width1 = 150\n | alt1 = Skeletal formula of 3-hydroxybutyric acid\n | caption1 = [[beta-Hydroxybutyric acid|\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate]]\n\n | image2 = Acetoacetic acid-2D-skeletal.svg\n | width2 = 150\n | alt2 = Skeletal formula of 3-oxobutanoic acid\n | caption2 = [[acetoacetic acid]]\n\n | image3 = Acetone-2D-skeletal.svg\n | width3 = 75\n | alt3 = Skeletal formula of acetone\n | caption3 = [[acetone]]\n}}\nThe brain is composed of a network of [[Neurotransmission|neurons that transmit signals]] by propagating [[nerve impulse]]s. The propagation of this impulse from one neuron to another is typically controlled by [[neurotransmitter]]s, though there are also [[Electrical synapse|electrical pathways]] between some neurons. Neurotransmitters can inhibit impulse firing (primarily done by [[Gamma-Aminobutyric acid|\u03b3-aminobutyric acid]], or GABA) or they can excite the neuron into firing (primarily done by [[glutamate]]). A neuron that releases inhibitory neurotransmitters from its terminals is called an inhibitory neuron, while one that releases excitatory neurotransmitters is an excitatory neuron. When the normal balance between inhibition and excitation is significantly disrupted in all or part of the brain, a seizure can occur. The GABA system is an important target for anticonvulsant drugs, since seizures may be discouraged by increasing GABA synthesis, decreasing its breakdown, or enhancing its effect on neurons.<ref name=Stafstrom2004/>\n\nThe nerve impulse is characterised by a great influx of sodium ions through [[Voltage-gated sodium channel|channels]] in the neuron's [[cell membrane]] followed by an efflux of potassium ions through other channels. The neuron is unable to fire again for a short time (known as the [[Refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]]), which is mediated by another [[Calcium-activated potassium channel|potassium channel]]. The flow through these [[ion channel]]s is governed by a \"gate\" which is opened by either a voltage change or a [[Ligand-gated ion channel|chemical messenger]] known as a [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] (such as a neurotransmitter). These channels are another target for anticonvulsant drugs.<ref name=Stafstrom2004/>\n\nThere are many ways in which epilepsy occurs. Examples of pathological physiology include: unusual excitatory connections within the neuronal network of the brain; abnormal neuron structure leading to altered current flow; decreased inhibitory neurotransmitter synthesis; ineffective receptors for inhibitory neurotransmitters; insufficient breakdown of excitatory neurotransmitters leading to excess; immature synapse development; and impaired function of ionic channels.<ref name=Stafstrom2004/>\n\n===Seizure control===\nAlthough many hypotheses have been put forward to explain how the ketogenic diet works, it remains a mystery. Disproven hypotheses include [[Metabolic acidosis|systemic acidosis]] (high levels of acid in the blood), [[Electrolyte disturbance|electrolyte changes]] and [[hypoglycaemia]] (low [[blood glucose]]).<ref name=Hartman2007b/> Although many biochemical changes are known to occur in the brain of a patient on the ketogenic diet, it is not known which of these has an anticonvulsant effect. The lack of understanding in this area is similar to the situation with many anticonvulsant drugs.<ref name=Hartman2007/>\n\nOn the ketogenic diet, carbohydrates are restricted and so cannot provide for all the metabolic needs of the body. Instead, fatty acids are used as the major source of fuel. These are used through [[fatty acid metabolism|fatty-acid oxidation]] in the cell's [[mitochondria]] (the energy-producing parts of the cell). Humans can convert some [[amino acid]]s into glucose by a process called [[gluconeogenesis]], but cannot do this by using fatty acids.<ref name=Kerndt1982/> Since amino acids are needed to make proteins, which are essential for growth and repair of body tissues, these cannot be used only to produce glucose. This could pose a problem for the brain, since it is normally fuelled solely by glucose, and most fatty acids do not cross the [[blood\u2013brain barrier]]. However, the liver can use long-chain fatty acids to synthesise the three [[ketone bodies]] [[beta-Hydroxybutyric acid|\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate]], [[acetoacetate]] and [[acetone]]. These ketone bodies enter the brain and ''partially'' substitute for [[blood glucose]] as a source of energy.<ref name=Hartman2007/>\n\nThe ketone bodies are possibly anticonvulsant; in [[animal model]]s, acetoacetate and acetone protect against seizures. The ketogenic diet results in adaptive changes to brain energy metabolism that increase the energy reserves; ketone bodies are a more efficient fuel than glucose, and the number of mitochondria is increased. This may help the [[neuron]]s to remain stable in the face of increased energy demand during a seizure, and may confer a [[neuroprotective]] effect.<ref name=Hartman2007/>\n\nThe ketogenic diet has been studied in at least 14 rodent animal models of seizures. It is protective in many of these models and has a different protection profile than any known anticonvulsant.  Conversely, [[fenofibrate]], not used clinically as an antiepileptic, exhibits experimental [[anticonvulsant]] properties in adult rats comparable to the ketogenic diet.<ref name=Porta2009/>  This, together with studies showing its efficacy in patients who have failed to achieve seizure control on half a dozen drugs, suggests a unique mechanism of action.<ref name=Hartman2007/>\n\nAnticonvulsants suppress epileptic seizures, but they neither cure nor prevent the development of seizure susceptibility. The development of epilepsy (epileptogenesis) is a process that is poorly understood. A few anticonvulsants ([[valproate]], [[levetiracetam]] and [[benzodiazepine]]s) have shown antiepileptogenic properties in animal models of epileptogenesis. However, no anticonvulsant has ever achieved this in a clinical trial in humans. The ketogenic diet has been found to have antiepileptogenic properties in rats.<ref name=Hartman2007/>\n\n==Other applications==\nThe ketogenic diet has been studied for potential therapeutic use in various neurological disorders other than epilepsy: [[Alzheimer's disease]] (AD), [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS), [[autism]], headache, [[neurotrauma]], pain, [[Parkinson's disease]] (PD) and [[sleep disorder]]s.<ref name=Gano2014/>\n\nBecause some cancer cells are [[Warburg effect (oncology)|inefficient in processing ketone bodies for energy]], the ketogenic diet has also been suggested as a treatment for cancer.<ref name=\"Baranano2008\" /><ref name=\"Allen2014\" />  A 2018 review looked at the evidence from preclinical and clinical studies of ketogenic diets in cancer therapy. The clinical studies in humans are typically very small, with some providing weak evidence for anti-tumour effect, particularly for [[glioblastoma]], but in other cancers and studies, no anti-tumour effect was seen. Taken together, results from preclinical studies, albeit sometimes contradictory, tend to support an anti-tumor effect rather than a pro-tumor effect of the KD for most solid cancers.<ref name=Weber2018/>\n\nThe evidence of benefit for these conditions has not reached the level where clinical recommendations can be made.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Atkins diet]] \u2013 brand of low-carbohydrate diet\n* [[Ketosis]] \u2013 metabolic process that uses fats as an energy source\n* [[List of diets]]\n* [[Low-carbohydrate diet]] \u2013 varieties of diets that focus on reducing carbohydrates\n* [[Medium-chain triglyceride]] \u2013 easily absorbed, naturally occurring type of fat \n* [[Fad diet]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em|group=Note|refs=\n{{#tag:ref|Ketogenic \"eggnog\" is used during induction and is a drink with the required ketogenic ratio.

The diet forces the body to burn fats rather than [[carbohydrate]]s. Normally, the carbohydrates contained in food are converted into [[glucose]], which is then transported around the body and is particularly important in [[Brain metabolism|fueling brain function]]. However, if little carbohydrate remains in the diet, the [[liver]] converts [[triacylglycerol|fat]] into [[fatty acid]]s and [[ketone bodies]]. The ketone bodies pass into the [[brain]] and replace glucose as an energy source. An elevated level of ketone bodies in the blood, a state known as [[ketosis]], leads to a reduction in the frequency of [[epileptic seizure]]s.<ref name=Freeman2007/> Around half of children and young people with epilepsy who have tried some form of this diet saw the number of [[Epileptic seizure|seizures]] drop by at least half, and the effect persists even after discontinuing the diet.<ref name=MartinMcGill2018/> Some evidence indicates that adults with epilepsy may benefit from the diet, and that a less strict regimen, such as a modified [[Atkins diet]], is similarly effective.<ref name=Freeman2007/> Potential side effects may include [[constipation]], [[Hypercholesterolemia|high cholesterol]], growth slowing, [[acidosis]], and [[Kidney stone disease|kidney stones]].<ref name=Kossoff2013/>\n\nThe original therapeutic diet for [[epilepsy in children|paediatric epilepsy]] provides just enough protein for body growth and repair, and sufficient [[food energy|calories]]<ref name=Units group=Note/> to maintain the correct weight for age and height. The classic therapeutic ketogenic diet was developed for treatment of paediatric epilepsy in the 1920s and was widely used into the next decade, but its popularity waned with the introduction of effective [[anticonvulsant]] medications. This classic ketogenic diet contains a 4:1  ratio by weight of fat to combined protein and carbohydrate. This is achieved by excluding high-carbohydrate foods such as starchy fruits and vegetables, bread, pasta, grains, and sugar, while increasing the consumption of foods high in fat such as nuts, cream, and butter.<ref name=Freeman2007/> Most dietary fat is made of molecules called long-chain triglycerides (LCTs). However, [[medium-chain triglyceride]]s (MCTs)\u2014made from fatty acids with shorter [[carbon chain]]s than LCTs\u2014are more ketogenic. A variant of the classic diet known as the MCT ketogenic diet uses a form of [[coconut oil]], which is rich in MCTs, to provide around half the calories. As less overall fat is needed in this variant of the diet, a greater proportion of carbohydrate and protein can be consumed, allowing a greater variety of food choices.<ref name=Liu2008/><ref name=Zupec-Kania2008a/>\n\nIn 1994, Hollywood producer [[Jim Abrahams]], whose son's severe epilepsy was effectively controlled by the diet, created the Charlie Foundation for Ketogenic Therapies to further promote diet therapy. Publicity included an appearance on NBC's [[Dateline NBC|''Dateline'']] program and ''[[...First Do No Harm]]'' (1997), a [[television movie|made-for-television film]] starring [[Meryl Streep]]. The foundation sponsored a research study, the results of which\u2014announced in 1996\u2014marked the beginning of renewed scientific interest in the diet.<ref name=Freeman2007/> \n\nPossible therapeutic uses for the ketogenic diet have been studied for many additional neurological disorders, some of which include: [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], headache, [[neurotrauma]], pain, [[Parkinson's disease]], and [[sleep disorder]]s.<ref name=Gano2014/>\n\n==Epilepsy==\n[[Epilepsy]] is one of the most common [[neurology|neurological]] disorders after [[stroke]],<ref name=Stafstrom2004/> affecting around 50&nbsp;million people worldwide.<ref name=deBoer2008/> It is diagnosed in a person having recurrent, unprovoked [[seizure]]s. These occur when [[cortex (anatomy)|cortical]] [[neuron]]s fire excessively, [[Hypersynchronization of electrophysiological activity in epilepsy|hypersynchronously]], or both, leading to temporary disruption of normal brain function. This might affect, for example, the muscles, the senses, consciousness, or a combination. A seizure can be [[focal seizure|focal]] (confined to a specific part of the brain) or [[generalised seizure|generalised]] (spread widely throughout the brain and leading to a loss of consciousness). Epilepsy can occur for a variety of reasons; some forms have been classified into epileptic [[syndrome]]s, most of which begin in childhood. Epilepsy is considered refractory (not yielding to treatment) when two or three [[anticonvulsant]] drugs have failed to control it. About 60% of patients achieve control of their epilepsy with the first drug they use, whereas around 30% do not achieve control with drugs. When drugs fail, other options include [[epilepsy surgery]], [[vagus nerve stimulation]], and the ketogenic diet.<ref name=Stafstrom2004/>\n\n==History==\nThe ketogenic diet is a [[Mainstream#In science|mainstream]] dietary therapy that was developed to reproduce the success and remove the limitations of the non-mainstream use of [[fasting]] to treat epilepsy.<ref name=Fasting group=Note/> Although popular in the 1920s and '30s, it was largely abandoned in favour of new anticonvulsant drugs.<ref name=Freeman2007/> Most individuals with epilepsy can successfully control their seizures with medication. However, 20\u201330% fail to achieve such control despite trying a number of different drugs.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> For this group, and for children in particular, the diet has once again found a role in epilepsy management.<ref name=Freeman2007/><ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\n===Fasting===\n[[File:Conklin Fasting - NewYorkTimes.png|thumb|alt=Scan of newspaper column. See image description page for full text.|A news report of Dr Hugh Conklin's \"water diet\" treatment from 1922]]\n\nPhysicians of [[ancient Greece]] treated diseases, including epilepsy, by altering their patients' diet. An early treatise in the [[Hippocratic Corpus]], ''[[On the Sacred Disease]]'', covers the disease; it  dates from {{circa|400 BC}}. Its author argued against the prevailing view that epilepsy was supernatural in origin and cure, and proposed that dietary therapy had a rational and physical basis.<ref name=Hippocrates1 group=Note/> In the same collection, the author of ''Epidemics'' describes the case of a man whose epilepsy is cured as quickly as it had appeared, through complete abstinence of food and drink.<ref name=Hippocrates2 group=Note/> The royal physician [[Erasistratus]] declared, \"One inclining to epilepsy should be made to fast without mercy and be put on short rations.\"<ref name=Galen1 group=Note/> [[Galen]] believed an \"attenuating diet\"<ref name=Galen2 group=Note/> might afford a cure in mild cases and be helpful in others.<ref name=Temkin1971/>\n\nThe first modern study of fasting as a treatment for epilepsy was in France in 1911.<ref name=Guelpa1911/> Twenty epilepsy patients of all ages were \"detoxified\" by consuming a low-calorie vegetarian diet, combined with periods of fasting and purging. Two benefited enormously, but most failed to maintain compliance with the imposed restrictions. The diet improved the patients' mental capabilities, in contrast to their medication, [[potassium bromide]], which dulled the mind.<ref name=Bailey2005/>\n\nAround this time, [[Bernarr Macfadden]], an American exponent of [[physical culture]], popularised the use of fasting to restore health. His disciple, the [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic physician]] Dr. Hugh William Conklin of [[Battle Creek, Michigan]], began to treat his epilepsy patients by recommending fasting. Conklin conjectured that epileptic seizures were caused when a toxin, secreted from the [[Peyer's patches]] in the intestines, was discharged into the bloodstream. He recommended a fast lasting 18 to 25&nbsp;days to allow this toxin to dissipate. Conklin probably treated hundreds of epilepsy patients with his \"water diet\" and boasted of a 90% cure rate in children, falling to 50% in adults. Later analysis of Conklin's case records showed 20% of his patients achieved freedom from seizures and 50% had some improvement.<ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\nConklin's fasting therapy was adopted by [[neurology|neurologists]] in mainstream practice. In 1916, a Dr McMurray wrote to the ''New York Medical Journal'' claiming to have successfully treated epilepsy patients with a fast, followed by a starch- and sugar-free diet, since 1912. In 1921, prominent [[endocrinology|endocrinologist]] Henry Rawle Geyelin reported his experiences to the [[American Medical Association]] convention. He had seen Conklin's success first-hand and had attempted to reproduce the results in 36 of his own patients. He achieved similar results despite having studied the patients for only a short time. Further studies in the 1920s indicated that seizures generally returned after the fast. [[Charles P. Howland]], the parent of one of Conklin's successful patients and a wealthy New York corporate lawyer, gave his brother John Elias Howland a gift of $5,000 to study \"the ketosis of starvation\". As professor of paediatrics at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]], John E. Howland used the money to fund research undertaken by neurologist [[Stanley Cobb]] and his assistant [[William G. Lennox]].<ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\n===Diet===\nIn 1921, Rollin Turner Woodyatt reviewed the research on diet and [[diabetes]]. He reported that three water-soluble compounds, [[beta-Hydroxybutyric acid|\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate]], [[acetoacetate]], and [[acetone]] (known collectively as [[ketone bodies]]), were produced by the liver in otherwise healthy people when they were starved or if they consumed a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet.<ref name=Wheless2004/> Dr. Russell Morse Wilder, at the [[Mayo Clinic]], built on this research and coined the term \"ketogenic diet\" to describe a diet that produced a high level of ketone bodies in the blood ([[ketonemia]]) through an excess of fat and lack of carbohydrate. Wilder hoped to obtain the benefits of fasting in a dietary therapy that could be maintained indefinitely. His trial on a few epilepsy patients in 1921 was the first use of the ketogenic diet as a treatment for epilepsy.<ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\nWilder's colleague, paediatrician Mynie Gustav Peterman, later formulated the classic diet, with a ratio of one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight in children, 10\u201315&nbsp;g of carbohydrate per day, and the remainder of calories from fat. Peterman's work in the 1920s established the techniques for induction and maintenance of the diet. Peterman documented positive effects (improved alertness, behaviour, and sleep) and adverse effects (nausea and vomiting due to excess ketosis). The diet proved to be very successful in children: Peterman reported in 1925 that 95% of 37 young patients had improved seizure control on the diet and 60% became seizure-free. By 1930, the diet had also been studied in 100 teenagers and adults. Clifford Joseph Barborka, Sr., also from the Mayo Clinic, reported that 56% of those older patients improved on the diet and 12% became seizure-free. Although the adult results are similar to modern studies of children, they did not compare as well to contemporary studies. Barborka concluded that adults were least likely to benefit from the diet, and the use of the ketogenic diet in adults was not studied again until 1999.<ref name=Wheless2004/><ref name=Kossoff2007/>\n\n===Anticonvulsants and decline===\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, when the only anticonvulsant drugs were the sedative [[Potassium bromide|bromides]] (discovered 1857) and [[phenobarbital]] (1912), the ketogenic diet was widely used and studied. This changed in 1938 when [[H. Houston Merritt|H. Houston Merritt, Jr.]] and [[Tracy Putnam]] discovered [[phenytoin]] (Dilantin), and the focus of research shifted to discovering new drugs. With the introduction of [[sodium valproate]] in the 1970s, drugs were available to neurologists that were effective across a broad range of epileptic syndromes and seizure types. The use of the ketogenic diet, by this time restricted to difficult cases such as [[Lennox\u2013Gastaut syndrome]], declined further.<ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\n===MCT diet===\n[[File:Liquigen edit.jpg|thumb|alt=A glass bottle of 250 ml of Liquigen, a white opaque liquid|[[Medium-chain triglyceride]] (MCT) oil emulsion]]\nIn the 1960s,  [[medium-chain triglyceride]]s (MCTs) were found to produce more ketone bodies per unit of energy than normal dietary fats (which are mostly long-chain triglycerides).<ref name=Huttenlocher1971/> MCTs are more efficiently absorbed and are rapidly transported to the liver via the [[hepatic portal system]] rather than the [[lymphatic system]].<ref name=Neal2008/> The severe carbohydrate restrictions of the classic ketogenic diet made it difficult for parents to produce palatable meals that their children would tolerate. In 1971, [[Peter Huttenlocher]] devised a ketogenic diet where about 60% of the calories came from the MCT oil, and this allowed more protein and up to three times as much carbohydrate as the classic ketogenic diet. The oil was mixed with at least twice its volume of skimmed milk, chilled, and sipped during the meal or incorporated into food. He tested it on 12 children and adolescents with intractable seizures. Most children improved in both seizure control and alertness, results that were similar to the classic ketogenic diet. Gastrointestinal upset was a problem, which led one patient to abandon the diet, but meals were easier to prepare and better accepted by the children.<ref name=Huttenlocher1971/> The MCT diet replaced the classic ketogenic diet in many hospitals, though some devised diets that were a combination of the two.<ref name=Wheless2004/>\n\n===Revival===\nThe ketogenic diet achieved national media exposure in the US in October 1994, when NBC's [[Dateline NBC|''Dateline'']] television programme reported the case of Charlie Abrahams, son of Hollywood producer [[Jim Abrahams]]. The two-year-old suffered from epilepsy that had remained uncontrolled by mainstream and alternative therapies. Abrahams discovered a reference to the ketogenic diet in an epilepsy guide for parents and brought Charlie to [[John M. Freeman (neurologist)|John M. Freeman]] at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]], which had continued to offer the therapy. Under the diet, Charlie's epilepsy was rapidly controlled and his developmental progress resumed. This inspired Abrahams to create the Charlie Foundation to promote the diet and fund research.<ref name=Wheless2004/> A multicentre prospective study began in 1994, the results were presented to the American Epilepsy Society in 1996 and were published<ref name=Vining1998/> in 1998. There followed an explosion of scientific interest in the diet. In 1997, Abrahams produced a TV movie, ''[[...First Do No Harm]]'', starring Meryl Streep, in which a young boy's intractable epilepsy is successfully treated by the ketogenic diet.<ref name=Freeman2007/>\n\nBy 2007, the ketogenic diet was available from around 75 centres in 45 countries, and less restrictive variants, such as the modified Atkins diet, were in use, particularly among older children and adults. The ketogenic diet was also under investigation for the treatment of a wide variety of disorders other than epilepsy.<ref name=Freeman2007/>\n\n==Efficacy==\nThe ketogenic diet reduces seizure frequency by more than 50% in half of the patients who try it and by more than 90% in a third of patients.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> Three-quarters of children who respond do so within two weeks, though experts recommend a trial of at least three months before assuming it has been ineffective.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> Children with refractory epilepsy are more likely to benefit from the ketogenic diet than from trying another anticonvulsant drug.<ref name=Freeman2007/> Some evidence indicates that adolescents and adults may also benefit from the diet.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\n===Trial design===\nEarly studies reported high success rates; in one study in 1925, 60% of patients became seizure-free, and another 35% of patients had a 50% reduction in seizure frequency. These studies generally examined a [[Cohort study|cohort]] of patients recently treated by the physician (a [[retrospective study]]) and selected patients who had successfully maintained the dietary restrictions. However, these studies are difficult to compare to modern trials. One reason is that these older trials suffered from [[selection bias]], as they excluded patients who were unable to start or maintain the diet and thereby selected from patients who would generate better results. In an attempt to control for this bias, modern study design prefers a [[prospective cohort study|prospective cohort]] (the patients in the study are chosen before therapy begins) in which the results are presented for all patients regardless of whether they started or completed the treatment (known as [[Intention to treat analysis|intent-to-treat analysis]]).<ref name=Hartman2007b/>\n\nAnother difference between older and newer studies is that the type of patients treated with the ketogenic diet has changed over time. When first developed and used, the ketogenic diet was not a treatment of last resort; in contrast, the children in modern studies have already tried and failed a number of anticonvulsant drugs, so may be assumed to have more difficult-to-treat epilepsy. Early and modern studies also differ because the treatment [[Protocol (natural sciences)|protocol]] has changed. In older protocols, the diet was initiated with a prolonged [[fasting|fast]], designed to lose 5\u201310% [[body weight]], and heavily restricted the calorie intake. Concerns over child health and growth led to a relaxation of the diet's restrictions.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> Fluid restriction was once a feature of the diet, but this led to increased risk of constipation and kidney stones, and is no longer considered beneficial.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\n===Outcomes===\nA study with an intent-to-treat prospective design was published in 1998 by a team from the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]]<ref name=Freeman1998/> and followed-up by a report published in 2001.<ref name=Hemingway2001/> As with most studies of the ketogenic diet,  no [[control group]] (patients who did not receive the treatment) was used. The study enrolled 150 children. After three months, 83% of them were still on the diet, 26% had experienced a good reduction in seizures, 31% had had an excellent reduction, and 3% were seizure-free.<ref name=Reduction group=Note/> At 12 months, 55% were still on the diet, 23% had a good response, 20% had an excellent response, and 7% were seizure-free. Those who had discontinued the diet by this stage did so because it was ineffective, too restrictive, or due to illness, and most of those who remained were benefiting from it. The percentage of those still on the diet at two, three, and four years was 39%, 20%, and 12%, respectively. During this period, the most common reason for discontinuing the diet was because the children had become seizure-free or significantly better. At four years, 16% of the original 150 children had a good reduction in seizure frequency, 14% had an excellent reduction, and 13% were seizure-free, though these figures include many who were no longer on the diet. Those remaining on the diet after this duration were typically not seizure-free, but had had an excellent response.<ref name=Hemingway2001/><ref name=Kossoff2009c/>\n\nIt is possible to combine the results of several small studies to produce evidence that is stronger than that available from each study alone\u2014a statistical method known as [[meta-analysis]]. One of four such analyses, conducted in 2006, looked at 19 studies on a total of 1,084 patients.<ref name=Henderson2006/> It concluded that a third achieved an excellent reduction in seizure frequency and half the patients achieved a good reduction.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\nA [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane]] systematic review in 2018 found and analysed eleven randomized controlled trials of ketogenic diet in people with epilepsy for whom drugs failed to control their seizures.<ref name=MartinMcGill2018/> Six of the trials compared a group assigned to a ketogenic diet with a group not assigned to one. The other trials compared types of diets or ways of introducing them to make them more tolerable.<ref name=MartinMcGill2018/> In the largest trial of the ketogenic diet with a non-diet control<ref name=Neal2008 />, nearly 38% of the children and young people had half or fewer seizures with the diet compared 6% with the group not assigned to the diet. Two large trials of the Modified Atkins Diet compared to a non-diet control had similar results, with over 50% of children having half or fewer seizures with the diet compared to around 10% in the control group.<ref name=MartinMcGill2018/>\n\nA systematic review in 2018 looked at 16 studies on the ketogenic diet in adults. It concluded that the treatment was becoming more popular for that group of patients, that the efficacy in adults was similar to children, the side effects relatively mild. However, many patients gave up with the diet, for various reasons, and the quality of evidence was inferior to studies on children. Health issues include high levels of [[low-density lipoprotein]], high total [[cholesterol]], and [[weight loss]].<ref name=Liu2018/>\n\n==Indications and contraindications==\n[[File:Anticonvulsants.jpg|thumb|alt=Anticonvulsants|Experts on the ketogenic diet recommend it be strongly considered for children with uncontrolled epilepsy who have tried and failed two or three anticonvulsant drugs;<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> most children who start the ketogenic diet have failed at least three times this number.<ref name=Bergqvist2004/>]]\nThe ketogenic diet is indicated as an adjunctive (additional) treatment in children and young people with [[drug-resistant epilepsy]].<ref name=NICE/><ref name=SIGN/> It is approved by national [[Medical guideline|clinical guidelines]] in Scotland,<ref name=SIGN/> England, and Wales<ref name=NICE/> and reimbursed by nearly all US insurance companies.<ref name=Turner2006/> Children with a focal [[lesion]] (a single point of brain abnormality causing the epilepsy) who would make suitable candidates for [[epilepsy surgery|surgery]] are more likely to become seizure-free with surgery than with the ketogenic diet.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/><ref name=Stainman2007/> About a third of epilepsy centres that offer the ketogenic diet also offer a dietary therapy to adults. Some clinicians consider the two less restrictive dietary variants\u2014the low [[glycaemic index]] treatment and the modified Atkins diet\u2014to be more appropriate for adolescents and adults.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> A liquid form of the ketogenic diet is particularly easy to prepare for, and well tolerated by, infants on formula and children who are [[feeding tube|tube-fed]].<ref name=Zupec-Kania2008a/><ref name=Kossoff2004b/>\n\nAdvocates for the diet recommend that it be seriously considered after two medications have failed, as the chance of other drugs succeeding is only 10%.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/><ref name=Kossoff2004a/><ref name=Spendiff2008/> The diet can be considered earlier for some epilepsy and genetic syndromes where it has shown particular usefulness. These include [[Dravet syndrome]], [[infantile spasms]], [[myoclonic-astatic epilepsy]], and [[tuberous sclerosis complex]].<ref name=Kossoff2009a/><ref name=Wang2014/>\n\nA survey in 2005 of 88 paediatric neurologists in the US found that 36% regularly prescribed the diet after three or more drugs had failed, 24% occasionally prescribed the diet as a last resort, 24% had only prescribed the diet in a few rare cases, and 16% had never prescribed the diet. Several possible explanations exist for this gap between [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence]] and clinical practice.<ref name=Mastriani2008/> One major factor may be the lack of adequately trained [[dietitian]]s who are needed to administer a ketogenic diet programme.<ref name=Kossoff2004a/>\n\nBecause the ketogenic diet alters the body's metabolism, it is a [[first-line therapy]] in children with certain [[congenital metabolic disease]]s such as [[Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency|pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) deficiency]] and [[De Vivo disease|glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome]],<ref name=Wang2018/> which prevent the body from using carbohydrates as fuel, leading to a dependency on ketone bodies. The ketogenic diet is beneficial in treating the seizures and some other symptoms in these diseases and is an absolute indication.<ref name=Huffman2006/> However, it is absolutely [[contraindication|contraindicated]] in the treatment of other diseases such as [[pyruvate carboxylase deficiency]], [[porphyria]], and other rare [[Inborn errors of lipid metabolism|genetic disorders of fat metabolism]].<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> Persons with a disorder of fatty acid oxidation are unable to metabolise fatty acids, which replace carbohydrates as the major energy source on the diet. On the ketogenic diet, their bodies would consume their own protein stores for fuel, leading to [[ketoacidosis]], and eventually coma and death.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2004/>\n\n==Interactions==\nThe ketogenic diet is usually initiated in combination with the patient's existing anticonvulsant regimen, though patients may be weaned off anticonvulsants if the diet is successful. Some evidence of synergistic benefits is seen when the diet is combined with the [[vagus nerve stimulation|vagus nerve stimulator]] or with the drug [[zonisamide]], and that the diet may be less successful in children receiving [[phenobarbital]].<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\n==Adverse effects==\nThe ketogenic diet is not considered a [[Benignity|benign]], holistic, or all-natural treatment. As with any serious medical therapy, it may result in complications, although these are generally less severe and less frequent than with anticonvulsant medication or surgery.<ref name=Turner2006/> Common but easily treatable short-term side effects include [[constipation]], low-grade [[acidosis]], and [[hypoglycaemia]] if an initial fast is undertaken. [[Hyperlipidemia|Raised levels of lipids in the blood]] affect up to 60% of children<ref name=Bergqvist2011/> and [[Hypercholesterolemia|cholesterol levels may increase]] by around 30%.<ref name=Turner2006/> This can be treated by changes to the fat content of the diet, such as from saturated fats towards polyunsaturated fats, and if persistent, by lowering the ketogenic ratio.<ref name=Bergqvist2011/> Supplements are necessary to counter the dietary deficiency of many [[micronutrient]]s.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\nLong-term use of the ketogenic diet in children increases the risk of slowed or stunted growth, bone fractures, and [[kidney stone]]s.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> The diet reduces levels of [[insulin-like growth factor 1]], which is important for childhood growth. Like many anticonvulsant drugs, the ketogenic diet has an adverse effect on bone health. Many factors may be involved such as acidosis and suppressed growth hormone.<ref name=Bergqvist2011/> About one in 20 children on the ketogenic diet develop kidney stones (compared with one in several thousand for the general population). A class of anticonvulsants known as [[carbonic anhydrase inhibitors]] ([[topiramate]], [[zonisamide]]) are known to increase the risk of kidney stones, but the combination of these anticonvulsants and the ketogenic diet does not appear to elevate the risk above that of the diet alone.<ref name=Sampath2007/> The stones are treatable and do not justify discontinuation of the diet.<ref name=Sampath2007/> Johns Hopkins Hospital now gives oral [[potassium citrate]] supplements to all ketogenic diet patients, resulting in one-seventh of the incidence of kidney stones.<ref name=McNally2009/> However, this empiric usage has not been tested in a prospective controlled trial.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> Kidney stone formation (nephrolithiasis) is associated with the diet for four reasons:<ref name=Sampath2007/>\n* Excess calcium in the urine ([[hypercalciuria]]) occurs due to increased bone demineralisation with acidosis. Bones are mainly composed of [[calcium phosphate]]. The phosphate reacts with the acid, and the calcium is excreted by the kidneys.<ref name=Sampath2007/>\n* Hypocitraturia: the urine has an abnormally low concentration of citrate, which normally helps to dissolve free calcium.<ref name=Sampath2007/>\n* The urine has a low pH, which stops [[uric acid]] from dissolving, leading to crystals that act as a [[wikt:nidus|nidus]] for calcium stone formation.<ref name=Sampath2007/>\n* Many institutions traditionally restricted the water intake of patients on the diet to 80% of normal daily needs;<ref name=Sampath2007/> this practice is no longer encouraged.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\nIn adolescent and adults, common side effects reported include weight loss, constipation, [[dyslipidemia]], and in women, [[dysmenorrhea]].<ref name=Kossoff2006/>\n\n==Implementation==\nThe ketogenic diet is a [[medical nutrition therapy]] that involves participants from various disciplines. Team members include a registered paediatric [[dietitian]] who coordinates the diet programme; a paediatric [[neurologist]] who is experienced in offering the ketogenic diet; and a [[registered nurse]] who is familiar with childhood epilepsy. Additional help may come from a [[medical social worker]] who works with the family and a [[pharmacist]] who can advise on the carbohydrate content of medicines. Lastly, the parents and other caregivers must be educated in many aspects of the diet for it to be safely implemented.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2008a/>\n\nImplementing the diet can present difficulties for caregivers and the patient due to the time commitment involved in measuring and planning meals. Since any unplanned eating can potentially break the nutritional balance required, some people find the discipline needed to maintain the diet challenging and unpleasant. Some people terminate the diet or switch to a less demanding diet, like the modified Atkins diet or the low-glycaemic index treatment diet, because they find the difficulties too great.<ref name=Vogelstein2010/>\n\n===Initiation===\nThe Johns Hopkins Hospital protocol for initiating the ketogenic diet has been widely adopted.<ref name=Kim2008/> It involves a consultation with the patient and their caregivers and, later, a short hospital admission.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> Because of the risk of complications during ketogenic diet initiation, most centres begin the diet under close medical supervision in the hospital.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\nAt the initial consultation, patients are [[screening (medicine)|screened]] for conditions that may [[contraindicate]] the diet. A dietary [[medical history|history]] is obtained and the parameters of the diet selected: the ketogenic ratio of fat to combined protein and carbohydrate, the calorie requirements and the fluid intake.<ref name=Hartman2007b/>\n\nThe day before admission to hospital, the proportion of carbohydrate in the diet may be decreased and the patient begins fasting after his or her evening meal.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> On admission, only calorie- and caffeine-free fluids<ref name=Zupec-Kania2004/> are allowed until dinner, which consists of \"[[eggnog]]\"<ref name=Eggnog group=Note/> restricted to one-third of the typical calories for a meal. The following breakfast and lunch are similar, and on the second day, the \"eggnog\" dinner is increased to two-thirds of a typical meal's caloric content. By the third day, dinner contains the full calorie quota and is a standard ketogenic meal (not \"eggnog\"). After a ketogenic breakfast on the fourth day, the patient is discharged. Where possible, the patient's current medicines are changed to carbohydrate-free formulations.<ref name=Hartman2007b/>\n\nWhen in the hospital, [[blood sugar|glucose levels]] are checked several times daily and the patient is monitored for signs of symptomatic [[ketosis]] (which can be treated with a small quantity of orange juice). Lack of energy and lethargy are common, but disappear within two weeks.<ref name=Vining1998/> The parents attend classes over the first three full days, which cover nutrition, managing the diet, preparing meals, avoiding sugar, and handling illness.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> The level of parental education and commitment required is higher than with medication.<ref name=Kossoff2008a/>\n\nVariations on the Johns Hopkins protocol are common. The initiation can be performed using [[outpatient]] clinics rather than requiring a stay in hospital. Often, no initial fast is used (fasting increases the risk of [[metabolic acidosis|acidosis]], hypoglycaemia, and weight loss). Rather than increasing meal sizes over the three-day initiation, some institutions maintain meal size, but alter the ketogenic ratio from 2:1 to 4:1.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\nFor patients who benefit, half achieve a seizure reduction within five days (if the diet starts with an initial fast of one to two days), three-quarters achieve a reduction within two weeks, and 90% achieve a reduction within 23 days. If the diet does not begin with a fast, the time for half of the patients to achieve an improvement is longer (two weeks), but the long-term seizure reduction rates are unaffected.<ref name=Kossoff2008a/> Parents are encouraged to persist with the diet for at least three months before any final consideration is made regarding efficacy.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\n===Maintenance===\nAfter initiation, the child regularly visits the hospital outpatient clinic where they are seen by the dietitian and neurologist, and various tests and examinations are performed. These are held every three months for the first year and then every six months thereafter. Infants under one year old are seen more frequently, with the initial visit held after just two to four weeks.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> A period of minor adjustments is necessary to ensure consistent ketosis is maintained and to better adapt the meal plans to the patient. This fine-tuning is typically done over the telephone with the hospital [[dietitian]]<ref name=Hartman2007b/> and includes changing the number of calories, altering the ketogenic ratio, or adding some MCT or coconut oils to a classic diet.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> [[ketonuria|Urinary ketone levels]] are checked daily to detect whether ketosis has been achieved and to confirm that the patient is following the diet, though the level of ketones does not correlate with an anticonvulsant effect.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> This is performed using ketone test strips containing [[nitroprusside]], which change colour from buff-pink to maroon in the presence of acetoacetate (one of the three ketone bodies).<ref name=Musa-Veloso2004/>\n\nA short-lived increase in seizure frequency may occur during illness or if [[ketone]] levels fluctuate. The diet may be modified if seizure frequency remains high, or the child is losing weight.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> Loss of seizure-control may come from unexpected sources. Even \"sugar-free\" food can contain carbohydrates such as [[maltodextrin]], [[sorbitol]], [[starch]], and [[fructose]]. The sorbitol content of suntan lotion and other skincare products may be high enough for some to be absorbed through the skin and thus negate ketosis.<ref name=Kossoff2004a/>\n\n===Discontinuation===\nAbout 20% of children on the ketogenic diet achieve freedom from seizures, and many are able to reduce the use of anticonvulsant drugs or eliminate them altogether.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> Commonly, at around two years on the diet, or after six months of being seizure-free, the diet may be gradually discontinued over two or three months. This is done by lowering the ketogenic ratio until urinary ketosis is no longer detected, and then lifting all calorie restrictions.<ref name=Martinez2007/> This timing and method of discontinuation mimics that of anticonvulsant drug therapy in children, where the child has become seizure-free. When the diet is required to treat certain metabolic diseases, the duration will be longer. The total diet duration is up to the treating ketogenic diet team and parents; durations up to 12 years have been studied and found beneficial.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\nChildren who discontinue the diet after achieving seizure freedom have about a 20% risk of seizures returning. The length of time until recurrence is highly variable, but averages two years. This risk of recurrence compares with 10% for resective surgery (where part of the brain is removed) and 30\u201350% for anticonvulsant therapy. Of those who have a recurrence, just over half can regain freedom from seizures either with anticonvulsants or by returning to the ketogenic diet. Recurrence is more likely if, despite seizure freedom, an [[electroencephalogram]]  shows epileptiform spikes, which indicate epileptic activity in the brain but are below the level that will cause a seizure. Recurrence is also likely if an [[MRI scan]] shows focal abnormalities (for example, as in children with [[tuberous sclerosis]]). Such children may remain on the diet longer than average, and children with tuberous sclerosis who achieve seizure freedom could remain on the ketogenic diet indefinitely.<ref name=Martinez2007/>\n\n==Variants==\n\n===Classic===\n[[File:Ketogenic diets pie MCT.svg|thumb|alt=A series of four pie charts for the typical American diet, the induction phase of the Atkins diet, the classic ketogenic diet, and the MCD ketogenic diet. The typical American diet has about half its calories from carbohydrates, where the others have very little carbohydrate. The Atkins diet is higher in protein than the others. Most of the fat in the MCT diet comes from MCT oil.|The ratio of calorific contributions from food components of four diets, by weight]]\n\nThe ketogenic diet is calculated by a [[dietitian]] for each child. Age, weight, activity levels, culture, and food preferences all affect the meal plan. First, the energy requirements are set at 80\u201390% of the recommended daily amounts (RDA) for the child's age (the high-fat diet requires less energy to process than a typical high-carbohydrate diet). Highly active children or those with muscle [[spasticity]] require more food energy than this; immobile children require less. The ketogenic ratio of the diet compares the weight of fat to the combined weight of carbohydrate and protein. This is typically 4:1, but children who are younger than 18&nbsp;months, older than 12&nbsp;years, or who are obese may be started on a 3:1 ratio. Fat is energy-rich, with 9&nbsp;kcal/g (38&nbsp;kJ/g) compared to 4&nbsp;kcal/g (17&nbsp;kJ/g) for carbohydrate or protein, so portions on the ketogenic diet are smaller than normal. The quantity of fat in the diet can be calculated from the overall energy requirements and the chosen ketogenic ratio. Next, the protein levels are set to allow for growth and body maintenance, and are around 1&nbsp;g protein for each kg of body weight. Lastly, the amount of carbohydrate is set according to what allowance is left while maintaining the chosen ratio. Any carbohydrate in medications or [[dietary supplement|supplements]] must be subtracted from this allowance. The total daily amount of fat, protein, and carbohydrate is then evenly divided across the meals.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2004/>\n\nA computer program such as KetoCalculator may be used to help generate recipes.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2008b/> The meals often have four components: [[cream|heavy whipping cream]], a protein-rich food (typically meat), a fruit or vegetable and a fat such as butter, vegetable oil, or mayonnaise. Only low-carbohydrate fruits and vegetables are allowed, which excludes bananas, potatoes, peas, and corn. Suitable fruits are divided into two groups based on the amount of carbohydrate they contain, and vegetables are similarly divided into two groups. Foods within each of these four groups may be freely substituted to allow for variation without needing to recalculate portion sizes. For example, cooked broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and green beans are all equivalent. Fresh, canned, or frozen foods are equivalent, but raw and cooked vegetables differ, and processed foods are an additional complication. Parents are required to be precise when measuring food quantities on an electronic [[weighing scale|scale]] accurate to 1&nbsp;g. The child must eat the whole meal and cannot have extra portions; any snacks must be incorporated into the meal plan. A small amount of MCT oil may be used to help with constipation or to increase ketosis.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2004/>\n\nThe classic ketogenic diet is not a [[balanced diet]] and only contains tiny portions of fresh fruit and vegetables, [[Food fortification|fortified]] cereals, and calcium-rich foods. In particular, the [[B vitamins]], [[calcium]], and [[vitamin D]] must be artificially supplemented. This is achieved by taking two sugar-free supplements designed for the patient's age: a [[multivitamin]] with [[Dietary mineral|minerals]] and [[calcium]] with vitamin D.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> A typical day of food for a child on a 4:1 ratio, 1,500&nbsp;kcal (6,300&nbsp;kJ) ketogenic diet comprises three small meals and three small snacks:<ref name=Turner2006/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Sample meal plan for one day\n!Meal\n!Menu idea\n!Ingredients\n|-\n|Breakfast\n|Egg with bacon\n|\n* 28&nbsp;g egg (about half an egg)\n* 11&nbsp;g bacon (about half a slice)\n* 37&nbsp;g of 36% heavy whipping cream\n* 23&nbsp;g butter\n* 9&nbsp;g slice of apple (about 5% of one apple)\n|-\n|Morning snack\n|Peanut butter ball\n(serving size: 0.5&nbsp;ounce)\n|\n* 6&nbsp;g peanut butter\n* 9&nbsp;g butter\n|-\n|Lunch\n|Tuna salad\n|\n* 28&nbsp;g tuna fish\n* 30&nbsp;g mayonnaise\n* 10&nbsp;g celery\n* 36&nbsp;g of 36% heavy whipping cream\n* 15&nbsp;g lettuce (one large leaf)\n|-\n|Afternoon snack\n|Keto yogurt\n(serving size: 1.3&nbsp;ounces)\n|\n* 18&nbsp;g of 36% heavy whipping cream\n* 17&nbsp;g sour cream\n* 4&nbsp;g strawberries (about half of one small strawberry)\n* [[artificial sweetener]]\n|-\n|Dinner\n|Cheeseburger (no bun)\n|\n* 22&nbsp;g [[Ground beef|minced (ground) beef]]\n* 10&nbsp;g [[American cheese]] (half a slice of cheese)\n* 26&nbsp;g butter\n* 38&nbsp;g of 36% heavy whipping cream\n* 10&nbsp;g lettuce (one medium leaf)\n* 11&nbsp;g green beans (one spoonful)\n|-\n|Evening snack\n|Keto custard\n(serving size: 1.2&nbsp;ounces)\n|\n* 25&nbsp;g of 36% heavy whipping cream\n* 9&nbsp;g egg (half a [[tablespoon]])\n* Pure, unsweetened vanilla flavouring\n|}\n\n===MCT oil===\nNormal dietary fat contains mostly long-chain triglycerides (LCTs). [[Medium-chain triglycerides]] (MCTs) are more ketogenic than LCTs because they generate more ketones per unit of energy when metabolised. Their use allows for a diet with a lower proportion of fat and a greater proportion of protein and carbohydrate,<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> leading to more food choices and larger portion sizes.<ref name=Liu2008/> The original MCT diet developed by Peter Huttenlocher in the 1970s derived 60% of its calories from MCT oil.<ref name=Huttenlocher1971/> Consuming that quantity of MCT oil caused abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and vomiting in some children. A figure of 45% is regarded as a balance between achieving good ketosis and minimising gastrointestinal complaints. The classical and modified MCT ketogenic diets are equally effective and differences in tolerability are not statistically significant.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> The MCT diet is less popular in the United States; MCT oil is more expensive than other dietary fats and is not covered by [[health insurance|insurance companies]].<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\n===Modified Atkins===\nFirst reported in 2003, the idea of using a form of the Atkins diet to treat epilepsy came about after parents and patients discovered that the induction phase of the Atkins diet controlled seizures. The ketogenic diet team at Johns Hopkins Hospital modified the Atkins diet by removing the aim of achieving weight loss, extending the induction phase indefinitely, and specifically encouraging fat consumption. Compared with the ketogenic diet, the modified Atkins diet (MAD) places no limit on calories or protein, and the lower overall ketogenic ratio (about 1:1) does not need to be consistently maintained by all meals of the day. The MAD does not begin with a fast or with a stay in hospital and requires less dietitian support than the ketogenic diet. Carbohydrates are initially limited to 10&nbsp;g per day in children or 20&nbsp;g per day in adults, and are increased to 20\u201330&nbsp;g per day after a month or so, depending on the effect on seizure control or tolerance of the restrictions. Like the ketogenic diet, the MAD requires vitamin and mineral supplements and children are carefully and periodically monitored at outpatient clinics.<ref name=Kossoff2008c/>\n\nThe modified Atkins diet reduces seizure frequency by more than 50% in 43% of patients who try it and by more than 90% in 27% of patients.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> Few adverse effects have been reported, though cholesterol is increased and the diet has not been studied long term.<ref name=Kossoff2008c/> Although based on a smaller data set (126 adults and children from 11 studies over five centres), these results from 2009 compare favorably with the traditional ketogenic diet.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/>\n\n===Low glycemic index treatment===\nThe low glycemic index treatment (LGIT)<ref name=Pfeifer2013/> is an attempt to achieve the stable [[blood glucose]] levels seen in children on the classic ketogenic diet while using a much less restrictive regimen. The hypothesis is that stable blood glucose may be one of the mechanisms of action involved in the ketogenic diet,<ref name=Kossoff2009a/> which occurs because the absorption of the limited carbohydrates is slowed by the high fat content.<ref name=Zupec-Kania2008a/> Although it is also a high-fat diet (with approximately 60% calories from fat),<ref name=Zupec-Kania2008a/> the LGIT allows more carbohydrate than either the classic ketogenic diet or the modified Atkins diet, approximately 40\u201360&nbsp;g per day.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> However, the types of carbohydrates consumed are restricted to those that have a glycaemic index lower than 50. Like the modified Atkins diet, the LGIT is initiated and maintained at outpatient clinics and does not require precise weighing of food or intensive dietitian support. Both are offered at most centres that run ketogenic diet programmes, and in some centres they are often the primary dietary therapy for adolescents.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\nShort-term results for the LGIT indicate that at one month approximately half of the patients experience a greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency, with overall figures approaching that of the ketogenic diet. The data (coming from one centre's experience with 76 children up to the year 2009) also indicate fewer side effects than the ketogenic diet and that it is better tolerated, with more palatable meals.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/><ref name=Muzykewicz2009/>\n\n===Prescribed formulations===\n[[File:Measuring Ketocal.jpg|thumb|alt=A cream-coloured powder is poured from a tin into a measuring jug on an electronic kitchen scale.|Measuring KetoCal\u2014a powdered formula for administering the classic ketogenic diet]]\nInfants and patients fed via a [[Feeding tube|gastrostomy tube]] can also be given a ketogenic diet. Parents make up a [[Medical prescription|prescribed]] powdered formula, such as KetoCal, into a liquid feed.<ref name=Hartman2007b/> Gastrostomy feeding avoids any issues with palatability, and bottle-fed infants readily accept the ketogenic formula.<ref name=Kossoff2004a/> Some studies have found this liquid feed to be more efficacious and associated with lower total [[cholesterol]] than a solid ketogenic diet.<ref name=Kossoff2009b/> KetoCal is a [[Enteral formula|nutritionally complete food]] containing milk protein and is supplemented with amino acids, fat, carbohydrate, vitamins, minerals and trace elements. It is used to administer the 4:1 ratio classic ketogenic diet in children over one year.

However, fasting and dietary changes are affected by religious and cultural issues. A culture where food is often prepared by grandparents or hired help means more people must be educated about the diet. When families dine together, sharing the same meal, it can be difficult to separate the child's meal. In many countries, food labelling is not mandatory, so calculating macronutrients such as fat, protein and carbohydrates can be difficult. In some countries, it may be hard to find sugar-free forms of medicines and supplements, to purchase an accurate electronic scale, or to afford MCT oils.<ref name=Kossoff2005/>\n\nIn Asia, the traditional diet includes rice and noodles as the main source of energy, making their elimination difficult. Therefore, the MCT-oil form of the diet, which allows more carbohydrate, has proved useful. In India, religious beliefs commonly affect the diet: some patients are vegetarians and will not eat root vegetables and will try to avoid beef. The Indian ketogenic diet is started without a fast due to cultural opposition towards fasting in children. The low-fat, high-carbohydrate nature of the normal Indian and Asian diet means that their ketogenic diets typically have a lower ketogenic ratio (1:1) than in America and Europe. However, they appear to be just as effective.<ref name=Kossoff2005/>\n\nIn many developing countries, the ketogenic diet is expensive because dairy fats and meat are more expensive than grain, fruit and vegetables. The modified Atkins diet has been proposed as a lower-cost alternative for those countries; the slightly more expensive food bill can be offset by a reduction in pharmaceutical costs if the diet is successful. The modified Atkins diet is less complex to explain and prepare and requires less support from a dietitian.<ref name=Kossoff2008b/>\n\n==Mechanism of action==\n\n===Seizure pathology===\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | header = [[Ketone bodies]]\n\n | image1 = beta-Hydroxybutyric acid-2D-skeletal.svg\n | width1 = 150\n | alt1 = Skeletal formula of 3-hydroxybutyric acid\n | caption1 = [[beta-Hydroxybutyric acid|\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate]]\n\n | image2 = Acetoacetic acid-2D-skeletal.svg\n | width2 = 150\n | alt2 = Skeletal formula of 3-oxobutanoic acid\n | caption2 = [[acetoacetic acid]]\n\n | image3 = Acetone-2D-skeletal.svg\n | width3 = 75\n | alt3 = Skeletal formula of acetone\n | caption3 = [[acetone]]\n}}\nThe brain is composed of a network of [[Neurotransmission|neurons that transmit signals]] by propagating [[nerve impulse]]s. The propagation of this impulse from one neuron to another is typically controlled by [[neurotransmitter]]s, though there are also [[Electrical synapse|electrical pathways]] between some neurons. Neurotransmitters can inhibit impulse firing (primarily done by [[Gamma-Aminobutyric acid|\u03b3-aminobutyric acid]], or GABA) or they can excite the neuron into firing (primarily done by [[glutamate]]). A neuron that releases inhibitory neurotransmitters from its terminals is called an inhibitory neuron, while one that releases excitatory neurotransmitters is an excitatory neuron. When the normal balance between inhibition and excitation is significantly disrupted in all or part of the brain, a seizure can occur. The GABA system is an important target for anticonvulsant drugs, since seizures may be discouraged by increasing GABA synthesis, decreasing its breakdown, or enhancing its effect on neurons.<ref name=Stafstrom2004/>\n\nThe nerve impulse is characterised by a great influx of sodium ions through [[Voltage-gated sodium channel|channels]] in the neuron's [[cell membrane]] followed by an efflux of potassium ions through other channels. The neuron is unable to fire again for a short time (known as the [[Refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]]), which is mediated by another [[Calcium-activated potassium channel|potassium channel]]. The flow through these [[ion channel]]s is governed by a \"gate\" which is opened by either a voltage change or a [[Ligand-gated ion channel|chemical messenger]] known as a [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] (such as a neurotransmitter). These channels are another target for anticonvulsant drugs.<ref name=Stafstrom2004/>\n\nThere are many ways in which epilepsy occurs. Examples of pathological physiology include: unusual excitatory connections within the neuronal network of the brain; abnormal neuron structure leading to altered current flow; decreased inhibitory neurotransmitter synthesis; ineffective receptors for inhibitory neurotransmitters; insufficient breakdown of excitatory neurotransmitters leading to excess; immature synapse development; and impaired function of ionic channels.<ref name=Stafstrom2004/>\n\n===Seizure control===\nAlthough many hypotheses have been put forward to explain how the ketogenic diet works, it remains a mystery. Disproven hypotheses include [[Metabolic acidosis|systemic acidosis]] (high levels of acid in the blood), [[Electrolyte disturbance|electrolyte changes]] and [[hypoglycaemia]] (low [[blood glucose]]).<ref name=Hartman2007b/> Although many biochemical changes are known to occur in the brain of a patient on the ketogenic diet, it is not known which of these has an anticonvulsant effect. The lack of understanding in this area is similar to the situation with many anticonvulsant drugs.<ref name=Hartman2007/>\n\nOn the ketogenic diet, carbohydrates are restricted and so cannot provide for all the metabolic needs of the body. Instead, fatty acids are used as the major source of fuel. These are used through [[fatty acid metabolism|fatty-acid oxidation]] in the cell's [[mitochondria]] (the energy-producing parts of the cell). Humans can convert some [[amino acid]]s into glucose by a process called [[gluconeogenesis]], but cannot do this by using fatty acids.<ref name=Kerndt1982/> Since amino acids are needed to make proteins, which are essential for growth and repair of body tissues, these cannot be used only to produce glucose. This could pose a problem for the brain, since it is normally fuelled solely by glucose, and most fatty acids do not cross the [[blood\u2013brain barrier]]. However, the liver can use long-chain fatty acids to synthesise the three [[ketone bodies]] [[beta-Hydroxybutyric acid|\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate]], [[acetoacetate]] and [[acetone]]. These ketone bodies enter the brain and ''partially'' substitute for [[blood glucose]] as a source of energy.<ref name=Hartman2007/>\n\nThe ketone bodies are possibly anticonvulsant; in [[animal model]]s, acetoacetate and acetone protect against seizures. The ketogenic diet results in adaptive changes to brain energy metabolism that increase the energy reserves; ketone bodies are a more efficient fuel than glucose, and the number of mitochondria is increased. This may help the [[neuron]]s to remain stable in the face of increased energy demand during a seizure, and may confer a [[neuroprotective]] effect.<ref name=Hartman2007/>\n\nThe ketogenic diet has been studied in at least 14 rodent animal models of seizures. It is protective in many of these models and has a different protection profile than any known anticonvulsant.  Conversely, [[fenofibrate]], not used clinically as an antiepileptic, exhibits experimental [[anticonvulsant]] properties in adult rats comparable to the ketogenic diet.<ref name=Porta2009/>  This, together with studies showing its efficacy in patients who have failed to achieve seizure control on half a dozen drugs, suggests a unique mechanism of action.<ref name=Hartman2007/>\n\nAnticonvulsants suppress epileptic seizures, but they neither cure nor prevent the development of seizure susceptibility. The development of epilepsy (epileptogenesis) is a process that is poorly understood. A few anticonvulsants ([[valproate]], [[levetiracetam]] and [[benzodiazepine]]s) have shown antiepileptogenic properties in animal models of epileptogenesis. However, no anticonvulsant has ever achieved this in a clinical trial in humans. The ketogenic diet has been found to have antiepileptogenic properties in rats.<ref name=Hartman2007/>\n\n==Other applications==\nThe ketogenic diet has been studied for potential therapeutic use in various neurological disorders other than epilepsy: [[Alzheimer's disease]] (AD), [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS), [[autism]], headache, [[neurotrauma]], pain, [[Parkinson's disease]] (PD) and [[sleep disorder]]s.<ref name=Gano2014/>\n\nBecause some cancer cells are [[Warburg effect (oncology)|inefficient in processing ketone bodies for energy]], the ketogenic diet has also been suggested as a treatment for cancer.<ref name=\"Baranano2008\" /><ref name=\"Allen2014\" />  A 2018 review looked at the evidence from preclinical and clinical studies of ketogenic diets in cancer therapy. The clinical studies in humans are typically very small, with some providing weak evidence for anti-tumour effect, particularly for [[glioblastoma]], but in other cancers and studies, no anti-tumour effect was seen. Taken together, results from preclinical studies, albeit sometimes contradictory, tend to support an anti-tumor effect rather than a pro-tumor effect of the KD for most solid cancers.<ref name=Weber2018/>\n\nThe evidence of benefit for these conditions has not reached the level where clinical recommendations can be made.<ref name=Kossoff2009a/>\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Atkins diet]] \u2013 brand of low-carbohydrate diet\n* [[Ketosis]] \u2013 metabolic process that uses fats as an energy source\n* [[List of diets]]\n* [[Low-carbohydrate diet]] \u2013 varieties of diets that focus on reducing carbohydrates\n* [[Medium-chain triglyceride]] \u2013 easily absorbed, naturally occurring type of fat \n* [[Fad diet]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em|group=Note|refs=\n{{#tag:ref|Ketogenic \"eggnog\" is used during induction and is a drink with the required ketogenic ratio.

Mowers of the type displayed usually vary in width from 20 to 24 inches.]]\n[[File:John Deere lawn mower.JPG|thumb|A residential riding or [[Riding mower|\"ride-on\" mower]].]]\n[[File:Robomow 110 City 2012-06-05.jpg|thumb|A battery-powered [[robotic lawn mower]].]]\n[[File:Pushmower1.JPG|thumb|upright|A non-motorized multiple blade reel push mower.]]\n\nA '''lawn mower''' (also named as '''mower''', '''grass cutter''' or '''lawnmower''') is a machine utilizing one or more revolving blades to cut a [[lawn|grass surface]] to an even height. The height of the cut grass may be fixed by the design of the mower, but generally is adjustable by the operator, typically by a single master lever, or by a lever or nut and bolt on each of the machine's wheels. The blades may be powered by manual force, with wheels mechanically connected to the cutting blades so that when the mower is pushed forward, the blades spin, or the machine may have a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]-powered or [[AC power plugs and sockets|plug-in]] [[electric motor]]. The most common self-contained power source for lawn mowers is a small (typically [[Single-cylinder engine|one cylinder]]) [[internal combustion engine]]. Smaller mowers often lack any form of propulsion, requiring human power to move over a surface; \"walk-behind\" mowers are self-propelled, requiring a human only to walk behind and guide them. Larger lawn mowers are usually either self-propelled \"walk-behind\" types, or more often, are \"ride-on\" mowers, equipped so the operator can ride on the mower and control it. A [[robotic lawn mower]] (\"lawn-mowing bot\", \"mowbot\", etc.) is designed to operate either entirely on its own, or less commonly by an operator by [[remote control]].\n\nTwo main styles of blades are used in lawn mowers. Lawn mowers employing a single blade that rotates about a single vertical axis are known as rotary mowers, while those employing a cutting bar and multiple blade assembly that rotates about a single horizontal axis are known as cylinder or reel mowers (although in some versions, the cutting bar is the only blade, and the rotating assembly consists of flat metal pieces which force the blades of grass against the sharp cutting bar).\n\nThere are several types of mowers, each suited to a particular scale and purpose. The smallest types, non-powered push mowers, are suitable for small residential lawns and gardens. Electrical or piston engine-powered push-mowers are used for larger residential lawns (although there is some overlap). [[Riding mower]]s, which sometimes resemble small tractors, are larger than push mowers and are suitable for large lawns, although commercial riding lawn mowers (such as [[zero-turn mower]]s) can be \"stand-on\" types, and often bear little resemblance to residential lawn tractors, being designed to mow large areas at high speed in the shortest time possible. The largest multi-gang (multi-blade) mowers are mounted on [[tractor]]s and are designed for large expanses of grass such as [[golf course]]s and municipal parks, although they are ill-suited for complex terrain.\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|Lawn#History}}\n\n=== Invention ===\nThe first lawn mower was invented by [[Edwin Beard Budding|Edwin Budding]] in 1830<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldlawnmowerclub.co.uk/aboutmowers/history|title=Mower History|work=oldlawnmowerclub.co.uk}}</ref> in [[Brimscombe and Thrupp|Thrupp]], just outside [[Stroud]], in [[Gloucestershire]], England. Budding's mower was designed primarily to cut the grass on sports grounds and extensive gardens, as a superior alternative to the [[scythe]], and was granted a British patent on August 31, 1830.<ref>{{cite patent|inventor-last=Passmore |inventor-first=Everett G. |publication-date=23 February 1869 |issue-date=28 January 1879|title=Improvement in Lawn-Mowers |country-code=US |description=RE |patent-number=8560}}; see pg 1, col 2.

The mower was pushed from behind. [[Cast iron|Cast-iron]] [[Gear|gear wheels]] transmitted power from the rear roller to the cutting cylinder, allowing the rear roller to drive the knives on the cutting cylinder; the ratio was 16:1. Another roller placed between the cutting cylinder and the main or land roller could be raised or lowered to alter the height of cut. The grass clippings were hurled forward into a tray-like box. It was soon realized, however, that an extra handle was needed in front to help pull the machine along. Overall, these machines were remarkably similar to modern mowers.<ref name=\"oldlawnmowerclub1\">{{cite web|author=The Old Lawnmower Club | url=http://www.oldlawnmowerclub.co.uk/mowinfo/mowhist.htm |title=Mower History |publisher=The Old Lawnmower Club | date= |accessdate=2011-04-23}}</ref>\n\nTwo of the earliest Budding machines sold went to Regent's Park Zoological Gardens in London and the Oxford Colleges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hdtrust.co.uk/hist02.htm |title=The Hall & Duck Trust: Lawn Mower History Part 2 |publisher=Hdtrust.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-04-23}}</ref> In an agreement between John Ferrabee and Edwin Budding dated May 18, 1830, Ferrabee paid the costs of enlarging the small blades, obtained letters of patent and acquired rights to manufacture, sell and license other manufacturers in the production of lawn mowers. Without patent,{{clarify|date=January 2018}} Budding and Ferrabee were shrewd enough to allow other companies to build copies of their mower under license, the most successful of these being Ransomes of Ipswich, which began making mowers as early as 1832.<ref name=\"oldlawnmowerclub1\"/>\n\nHis machine was the catalyst for the preparation of modern-style sporting ovals, [[Pitch (sports field)|playing fields]] (pitches), [[grass court]]s, etc. This led to the codification of modern rules for many sports, including for [[football]], [[Bowls|lawn bowls]], [[Tennis|lawn tennis]] and others.<ref>Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio National ''Ockham's Razor'', first broadcast 6 June 2010.</ref>\n\n=== Further improvements ===\n[[File:SLNSW 8483 The horsedrawn mower makes a vignette of a player putting.jpg|thumb|A horsedrawn lawn mower on an Australian golf course in the 1930s.]]\n[[File:Ransomes00.gif|Lawn mower advert|thumb|right|The first gasoline-powered lawn mower, 1902.]]\n\nIt took ten more years and further innovations to create a machine that could be drawn by animals, and sixty years before a steam-powered lawn mower was built. In the 1850s, [[Thomas Green & Son]] of [[Leeds]] introduced a mower called the Silens Messor (meaning silent cutter), which used a [[Chain drive|chain]] drive to transmit power from the rear roller to the cutting cylinder. These machines were lighter and quieter than the gear-driven machines that preceded them, although they were slightly more expensive.<ref name=\"oldlawnmowerclub1\"/> The rise in popularity of lawn sports helped prompt the spread of the invention. Lawn mowers became a more efficient alternative to the [[scythe]] and domesticated [[grazing]] animals.\n\nManufacture of lawn mowers took off in the 1860s. By 1862, Ferrabee's company was making eight models in various roller sizes. He manufactured over 5000 machines until production ceased in 1863. The first grass boxes were flat trays but took their present shape in the 1860s. James Sumner of [[Lancashire]] patented the first [[steam engine|steam-powered]] lawn mower in 1893. His machine burned petrol and/or paraffin ([[kerosene]]) as fuel. These were heavy machines that took several hours to warm up to operating pressure.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://backyardrefuge.com/history-of-the-lawn-mower/ | title=The History of the LawnMower | publisher=backyardrefuge.com | date= |accessdate=2018-11-19}}</ref> After numerous advances, these machines were sold by the Stott Fertilizer and Insecticide Company of [[Manchester]] and Sumner. The company they both controlled was called the [[Leyland Motors|Leyland Steam Motor Company]].\n\nAround 1900, one of the best known English machines was the [[Ransomes, Sims & Jefferies|Ransomes]]' Automaton, available in chain- or gear-driven models. Numerous manufacturers entered the field with petrol (gasoline) engine-powered mowers after the start of the 20th century. The first was produced by Ransomes in 1902. JP Engineering of Leicester, founded after [[World War I]], produced a range of very popular chain-driven mowers. About this time, an operator could ride behind animals that pulled the large machines. These were the first riding mowers.\n\nThe first United States patent for a reel lawn mower was granted to Amariah Hills on January 12, 1868.<ref name=\"about1\">{{cite web|author=mary bellis |url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/bllawns.htm |title=Greener Pastures \u2013 History of the Lawn Mower |publisher=Inventors.about.com |date=2010-06-16 |accessdate=2011-04-23}}</ref> In 1870, Elwood McGuire of Richmond, Indiana designed a human-pushed lawn mower, which was very lightweight and a commercial success. John Burr patented an improved rotary-blade lawn mower in 1899, with the wheel placement altered for better performance. Amariah Hills went on to found the Archimedean Lawn Mower Co. in 1871.\n\nIn the United States, gasoline-powered lawn mowers were first manufactured in 1914 by Ideal Power Mower Co. of [[Lansing, Michigan]], based on a patent by [[Ransom E. Olds]]. Ideal Power Mower also introduced the world's first self-propelled, riding lawn tractor in 1922, known as the \"Triplex\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reoldsmuseum.org/ideal-power-lawn-mower|title=Ideal Power Lawn Mower|work=reoldsmuseum.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://reoldsmuseum.org/lansing-lawnmowers|title=Lansing & Lawnmowers|work=reoldsmuseum.org}}</ref> The roller-drive lawn mower has changed very little since around 1930. ''Gang mowers'', those with multiple sets of blades to cut a wider swath, were built in the United States in 1919 by the [[Worthington Mower Company]].\n\n== Atco Ltd and the first motor mower ==\n{{main|Atco (British Mower Company)}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-09651, Elektrische Grasm\u00e4hmaschine.jpg|thumb|Commercial lawn mower in use April 1930 in Berlin.]]\n\nIn the 1920s one of the most successful companies to emerge during this period was Atco, at that time a brand name of Charles H Pugh Ltd. The Atco motor mower, launched in 1921 was an immediate success. Just 900 of the 22-inch-cut machines were made in 1921, each costing \u00a375. Within five years, annual production had accelerated to tens of thousands. Prices were reduced and a range of sizes was available, making the Standard the first truly mass-produced engine-powered mower.\n\n=== Rotary mowers ===\nRotary mowers were not developed until engines were small enough and powerful enough to run the blades at sufficient speed. Many people experimented with rotary blade mowers in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and Power Specialties Ltd. introduced a gasoline-powered rotary mower. Kut Kwick replaced the saw blade of the \"Pulp Saw\" with a double-edged blade and a cutter deck, converting the \"Pulp Saw\" into the first ever out-front rotary mower.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kutkwick.com/about.htm|title=About: An Industry Innovator for Over 70 Years|work=kutkwick.com}}</ref>\n\nOne company that produced rotary mowers commercially was the Australian [[Victa lawn mower|Victa]] company, starting in 1952. Its mowers were lighter and easier to use than similar ones that had come before. The first Victa mowers were made at [[Mortlake, New South Wales|Mortlake]], an inner suburb of [[Sydney]], by local resident Mervyn Victor Richardson. He made his first model out of scrap in his garage. The first Victa mowers were then manufactured, going on sale on 20 September 1952. The new company, Victa Mowers Pty Ltd, was incorporated on 13 February 1953.\n\nThe venture was so successful that by 1958 the company moved to much larger premises in [[Parramatta Road]], [[Concord, New South Wales|Concord]], and then to [[Milperra, New South Wales|Milperra]], by which time the mower incorporated an engine, designed and manufactured by Victa, which was specially designed for mowing, rather than employing a general-purpose engine bought from outside suppliers.<ref>{{cite web |title=How do you sell a million mowers? |url=http://hawkey.id.au/Victa%20History.php |archivedate=2009-06-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615030323/http://www.hawkey.id.au/Victa%20History.php}}</ref> Two Victa mowers, from 1958 and 1968 respectively, are held in the collection of the [[National Museum of Australia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/collections-search/results?QueryTerms=Victa&Limitpp=20&search=basic|title=Collection Explorer \u2013 National Museum of Australia|work=nma.gov.au}}</ref> The Victa mower is regarded as something of an Australian [[cultural icon|icon]], appearing en masse, in simulated form, at the [[2000 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|opening of the Sydney Olympic Games]] in 2000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXakbHyn7GE&t=626s|title=. . at 10mins 26 secs exact in this video}}</ref>\n\nThe hover mower, first introduced by [[Flymo]] in 1964, is a form of rotary mower using an air cushion on the [[hovercraft]] principle.\n\n== Types ==\n\n=== By rotation ===\n\n==== Cylinder or reel mowers ====\n\nA cylinder mower or reel mower carries a fixed, horizontal cutting blade at the desired height of cut. Over this is a fast-spinning reel of blades which force the grass past the cutting bar. Each blade in the blade cylinder forms a helix around the reel axis, and the set of spinning blades describes a cylinder.\n\nOf all the mowers, a properly adjusted cylinder mower makes the cleanest cut of the grass,<ref name=\"hessayon\">{{Cite book\n  |last=Hessayon\n  |first=D.G.\n  |authorlink=D. G. Hessayon\n  |year=2007\n  |title=The Lawn Expert\n  |publisher=Transworld Publishers\n  |location=London\n  |isbn=978-0-903505-48-2\n  |pages=[https://archive.org/details/newlawnexpert00hess/page/28 28\u201333]\n  |url-access=registration\n  |url=https://archive.org/details/newlawnexpert00hess/page/28\n  }}</ref> and this allows the grass to heal more quickly. The cut of a well-adjusted cylinder mower is straight and definite, as if cut with a pair of scissors. This clean cut promotes healthier, thicker and more resilient lawn growth that is more resistant to disease, weeds and parasites. Lawn cut with a cylinder mower is less likely to result in yellow, white or brown discolouration as a result of leaf shredding. While the cutting action is often likened to that of scissors, it is not necessary for the blades of the spinning cylinder to contact the horizontal cutting bar.<ref name=\"hessayon\" /> If the gap between the blades is less than the thickness of the grass blades, a clean cut can still be made. If more, however, the grass will slip through. Reel mowers also have more difficulty mowing over uneven terrain.\n\nThere are many variants of the cylinder mower. Push mowers have no engine and are usually used on smaller lawn areas where access is a problem, where noise pollution is undesirable and where air pollution is unwanted. As the mower is pushed along, the wheels drive gears which rapidly spin the reel. Typical cutting widths are {{convert|10|to|16|in|mm}}. Advances in materials and engineering have resulted in these mowers being very light and easy to operate and manoeuvre compared with their predecessors while still giving all the cutting advantages of professional cylinder mowers. Their distinct environmental benefits, both in noise and air pollution, are also strong selling points, something not lost on many international zoos, animal sanctuaries and exclusive hotel groups.\n\nThe basic push mower mechanism is also used in gangs towed behind a [[tractor]]. The individual mowers are arranged in a \"v\" behind the tractor with each mower's track slightly overlapping that of the mower in front of it. Gang mowers are used over large areas of turf such as sports fields or parks.\n\nA gasoline engine or electric motor can be added to a cylinder mower to power the cylinder, the wheels, the roller, or any combination of these. A typical arrangement on electric powered machines for residential lawns is for the motor to power the cylinder while the operator pushes the mower along. The electric models can be corded or cordless. On petrol machines the engine drives both the cylinder and the rear roller. Some variants have only three blades in a reel spinning at great speed, and these models are able to cut grass which has grown too long for ordinary push mowers.<ref name=\"hessayon\" /> One type of reel mower, now largely obsolete, was a powered version of the traditional side-wheel push mower, which was used on residential lawns. An internal combustion engine sat atop the reel housing and drove the wheels, usually through a belt. The wheels in turn drove the reel, as in the push mower.\n\nGreens mowers are used for the precision cutting of golf greens and have a cylinder made up of at least eight, but normally ten, blades. The machine has a roller before and after the cutting cylinder which smooths the freshly cut lawn and minimizes wheel marks. Due to the weight, the engine also propels the mower. Much smaller and lighter variants of the roller mower are sometimes used for small patches of ornamental lawns around flower beds, and these have no engine.<ref name=\"hessayon\" />\n\nRiding reel mowers are also produced. Typically, the cutting reels are ahead of the vehicle's main wheels, so that the grass can be cut before the wheels push the grass over onto the ground. The reels are often hydraulically powered.\n\nThe main parts of a cylinder or reel mower are:\n\n* '''Blade reel/cylinder:''' Consists of numerous (3 to 7) helical blades that are attached to a rotating shaft. The blades rotate, creating a scissor-like cutting motion against the bed knife.\n* '''Bed knife:''' The stationary cutting mechanism of a cylinder/reel mower. This is a fixed horizontal blade that is mounted to the frame of the mower.\n* '''Body frame:''' The main structural frame of the mower onto which the other parts of the mower are mounted.\n* '''Wheels:''' Help propel the mower in action. Generally, reel mowers have two wheels.\n* '''Push handle:''' The \"power source\" of a manually operated reel mower. This is a sturdy T-shaped, rectangular, or trapezoidal handle that is connected to the frame, wheels and blade chamber.\n* '''Motor:''' The power source of a reel mower that is powered by gasoline or electricity.\n\n==== Rotary mowers ====\n[[Image:Electric mower underside.jpg|right|thumb|A rotary mower (viewed from underneath), with a [[mulch]]ing blade that rotates around the center.]]\n\nA rotary mower rotates about a vertical axis with the blade spinning at high speed relying on impact to cut the grass. This tends to result in a rougher cut and bruises and shreds the grass leaf resulting in discolouration of the leaf ends as the shredded portion dies. This is particularly prevalent if the blades become clogged or blunt. Most rotary mowers need to be set a little higher than cylinder equivalents to avoid scalping and gouging of slightly uneven lawns, although some modern rotaries are fitted with a rear roller to provide a more formal striped cut. These machines will also tend to cut lower (13&nbsp;mm) than a standard four-wheeled rotary.\n\nThe main parts of a rotary mower are:\n\n* '''Cutter deck housing:''' Houses the blade and the drive system of the mower. It is shaped to effectively eject the grass clippings from the mower.\n* '''Blade mounting and drive system:''' The blade of a rotary mower is usually mounted directly to the crankshaft of its engine, but it can be propelled by a hydraulic motor or a belt pulley system.\n* '''[[Mower blade]]:''' A blade that rotates in a horizontal plane (about a vertical axis). Some mowers have multiple blades. The blade features edges that are slightly curved upward to generate a continuous air flow as the blade rotates (as a [[fan (machine)|fan]]), thus creating a sucking and tearing action.\n* '''Engine/motor:''' May be powered by gasoline or electricity.\n* '''Wheels:''' Generally four wheels, two front and two rear. Some mowers have a roller in place of the rear wheels.\n\n=== By energy source ===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2018}}\n\n==== Gasoline (petrol) ====\nExtensive grass trimming was not common before the widespread application of the vertical shaft single cylinder gasoline/petrol engine. In the United States this development paralleled the market penetration of companies such as the [[Briggs & Stratton]] company of Wisconsin.\n\nMost rotary push mowers are powered by [[internal combustion engine]]s. Such engines are usually [[four-stroke engine]]s, used for their greater torque and cleaner combustion (although a number of older models used [[two-stroke engine]]s), running on [[gasoline]] (petrol) or other [[liquid fuel]]s. Internal combustion engines used with lawn mowers normally have only one cylinder. Power generally ranges from four to seven [[horsepower]]. The engines usually have a [[carburetor]] and require a [[Recoil start|manual pull crank]] to start them, although an [[Starter (engine)|electric starter]] is offered on some models, particularly large riding and commercial mowers. Some mowers have a [[Throttle#Internal combustion engines|throttle control]] on the handlebar with which the operator can adjust the engine speed. Other mowers have a fixed, pre-set engine speed. All are equipped with a [[Governor (device)#Small engines|governor]] (often centrifugal/mechanical or air vane style) to open the throttle as needed to maintain the pre-selected speed when the force needed to cut the thicker or taller grass is encountered.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.briggsandstratton.com/na/en_us/support/faqs/browse/governor-system.html|title=How does a small engine governor work? {{!}} Briggs & Stratton|website=www.briggsandstratton.com|access-date=2018-03-22}}</ref> Gasoline mowers have the advantages over electric mowers of greater power and distance range.

Both are relatively quiet, typically producing less than 75 decibels, while a gasoline lawn mower can be 95 decibels or more.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Hollis |first=Scott |date=April\u2013May 2005 |title=Lawn Mowers: Cordless and Electric  |url=https://www.motherearthnews.com/homesteading-and-livestock/lawn-mowers-cordless-electric-zmaz05amzsel |magazine=[[Mother Earth News]] |volume=67 |issue=4 |page=209 |access-date=24 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nCorded electric mowers are limited in range by their trailing power cord, which may limit their use with lawns extending outward more than 100\u2013150 feet (30\u201345 m) from the nearest available power outlet. There is the additional hazard with these machines of accidentally mowing over the power cable, which stops the mower and may put users at risk of receiving a dangerous [[electric shock]]. Installing a [[residual-current device]] (GFCI) on the outlet may reduce the shock risk.\n\nCordless electric mowers are powered by a variable number (typically 1\u20134) of 12-volt, 56-volt, and 80-volt [[Rechargeable battery|rechargeable batteries]]. Typically, more [[Electric battery|batteries]] mean more run time and/or power (and more [[weight]]). Batteries can be in the interior of the lawn mower or on the outside. If on the outside, the depleted batteries can be quickly swapped with recharged batteries. Cordless mowers have the maneuverability of a gasoline-powered mower and the environmental friendliness of a corded electric mower, but they are more expensive and come in fewer models (particularly the self-propelling type) than either. The eventual disposal of worn-out batteries is problematic (though some manufacturers offer to recycle them), and the motors in some cordless mowers tend to be less powerful than gasoline motors of the same total weight (including batteries).\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"160px\">\nImage:Automower.jpg|Robotic mower.\nImage:Hover-mower.jpg|Hover mower (''underside view'').\nFile:CC500BAT.png|Cordless and rechargeable rotary lawn mower, in mulch mode, removable battery located above rear wheels\nImage:Electric mower-250px.jpg|Corded rotary lawn mower, with rear grass catcher (note the red cord attached at the handle).\n</gallery>\n\n==== By hand ====\nIn hand-powered lawn mowers, the reel is attached to the mower's wheels by gears, so that when the mower is pushed forward, the reel spins several times faster than the plastic or rubber-tired wheels turn. Depending on the placement of the reel, these mowers often cannot cut grass very close to lawn obstacles.\n\n=== Other notable types ===\n'''Hover mowers''' are powered rotary push lawn mowers that use an impeller above the spinning blades to drive air downward, thereby creating an air cushion that lifts the mower above the ground. The operator can then easily move the mower as it floats over the grass. Hover mowers are necessarily light in order to achieve the air cushion and typically have [[plastic]] bodies with an electric motor. The most significant disadvantage, however, is the cumbersome usability in rough terrain or on the edges of lawns, as the lifting air-cushion is destroyed by wide gaps between the chassis and the ground. Hover mowers are built to operate on steep slopes, waterfronts, and high-weeded areas, so they are often used by golf course [[greenskeeper]]s and commercial landscapers. Grass collection is often available, but can be poor in some models. The quality of cut can be inferior if the grass is pushed away from the blade by the cushion of air.\n\nA '''[[robotic mower]]''' is contained by a border wire around the lawn that defines the area to be mowed. The robot uses this wire to locate the boundary of the area to be trimmed and in some cases to locate a recharging dock. Robotic mowers are capable of maintaining up to {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of grass. Robotic lawn mowers are increasingly sophisticated, are usually self-docking and contain rain sensors, nearly eliminating human interaction for mowing grass. Multiple robotic mowers can be used to mow an even larger area.\n\n'''Tractor pulled mowers''' are usually in the form of an attachment to a [[tractor]]. The attachments can simply function by the movement of the tractor similar to manual push cylinder mowers, but also sometimes may have powered moving blades. They are commonly mounted on either the side or the back of the tractor.\n\n{{Anchor|Riding mower}}'''Riding mowers''' (U.S. and Canada) or '''ride-on mowers''' (U.K. and Canada) are a popular alternative for large lawns. The operator is provided with a seat and controls on the mower and literally rides on the machine. Most use the horizontal rotating blade system, though usually with multiple blades. A common form of ride-on mower is the '''lawn tractor'''. These are usually designed to resemble a small [[tractor|agricultural tractor]], with the cutting deck mounted amidships between the front and rear axles.\n\nThe drives for these mowers are in several categories. The most common transmission for tractors is a manual transmission. The second most common transmission type is a form of [[continuously variable transmission]], called the hydrostatic transmission. These transmissions take several forms, from pumps driving separate motors, which may incorporate a gear reduction, to fully integrated units containing a pump, motor and gear reduction. Hydrostatic transmissions are more expensive than mechanical transmissions, but they are easier to use and can transmit greater torque to the wheels compared to a typical mechanical transmission. The least common drive type, and the most expensive, is electric.\n\nThere have been a number of attempts to replace hydrostatic transmissions with lower cost alternatives, but these attempts, which include variable belt types, e.g. MTD's \"Auto Drive\", and toroidal, have various performance or perception problems that have caused their market life to be short or their market penetration to be limited.\n\nRiding lawn mowers can often mount other devices, such as rototillers/rotavators, snow plows, snow blowers, yard vacuums, occasionally even front buckets or fork-lift tines (these are more properly known as \"lawn tractors\" in this case, being designed for a number of tasks). The ability to tow other devices is possible due the fact they have multiple gears, often up to 5 or 6 and variable top speeds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gardenknow.com/how-to-use-riding-lawn-mowers/ |title=How to Use Riding Lawn Mowers |publisher=Gardenknow.com |date= |accessdate=2019-06-03}}</ref>\n\nThe deck of a rotary mower is typically made of steel. Lighter steel is used on less expensive models, and heavier steel on more expensive models for durability. Other deck materials include [[aluminium]], which does not rust and is a staple of higher priced mowers, and hard composite plastic, which does not rust and is lighter and less expensive than aluminium. Electric mowers typically have a plastic deck.\n\nRiding mowers typically have an opening in the side or rear of the housing where the cut grass is expelled, as do most rotary lawn mowers. Some have a grass catcher attachment at the opening to bag the grass clippings.\n\n'''Mulching mowers''' use special [[mulch]]ing blades which are available for rotary mowers. The blade is designed to keep the clippings circulating underneath the mower until the clippings are chopped quite small. Other designs have twin blades to mulch the clippings to small pieces. This function has the advantages of forgoing the additional work collecting and disposing of grass clippings while reducing lawn waste in such a way that also creates convenient [[compost]] for the lawn, forgoing the expense and [[Fertilizer#Problems with inorganic fertilizer|adverse environmental effect]] of [[fertilizer]].\n\nMower manufacturers market their mowers as side discharge, 2-in-1, meaning bagging and mulching or side discharging and mulching, and 3-in-1, meaning bagging, mulching, and side discharge. Most 2-in-1 bagging and mulching mowers require a separate attachment to discharge grass onto the lawn. Some side discharge mower manufacturers also sell separate \"mulching plates\" that will cover the opening on the side discharge mower and, in combination with the proper blades, will convert the mower to a mulching mower. These conversions are impractical when compared with 2- or 3-in-1 mowers which can be converted in the field in seconds. There are two types of bagging mowers. A rear bag mower features an opening on the back of the mower through which the grass is expelled into the bag. Hi-vac mowers have a tunnel that extends from the side discharge to the bag. Hi-vac is also the type of grass collection used on some riding lawn mowers and lawn tractors and is suitable for use in dry conditions but less suitable for long wet lush grass as they often clog up. Mulching and bagging mowers are not well suited to long grass or thick weeds. In some ride-on mowers, the cut grass is dropped onto the ground and then collected by a set of rotating bristles, allowing even long, wet grass to be collected.\n\nRotary mowers with internal combustion engines come in three price ranges. Low priced mowers use older technology, smaller motors, and lighter [[steel]] decks. These mowers are targeted at the residential market and typically price is the most important selling point.\n\nProfessional grass-cutting equipment (used by large establishments such as universities, sports stadiums and local authorities) usually take the form of much larger, dedicated, ride-on platforms or attachments that can be mounted on, or behind, a standard tractor unit (a \"gang-mower\"). Either type may use rotating-blade or cylindrical-blade type cutters, although high-quality mowed surfaces demand the latter. Wide-area mowers (WAMs) are commercial grade mowers which have decks extended to either side, many to {{convert|12|ft|m}}. These extensions can be lowered for large area mowing or raised to decrease the mower's width and allow for easy transport on city roads or trailers. Commercial lawn-mowing companies have also enthusiastically adopted types such as the zero-turn mower (in both ride-on and stand-on versions), which allow high speed over the grass surface, and rapid turnaround at the end of rows, as well as excellent maneuverability around obstacles.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Wikimedia Conference 2015 photo by Pine - 36.jpg|A ride on mower being used to maintain a public garden (2015)\nFile:Ursus C360 PICT0076.jpg|A tractor-pulled mower.\nImage:Riding-mower-hbs.jpg|A [[zero-turn mower]]\n</gallery>\n\n== Safety issues ==\nRotary mowers can throw out debris with extreme velocity and energy. Additionally, the blades of a self-powered push mower (gasoline or electric) can injure a careless or inattentive user; consequently many come equipped with a [[dead man's switch]] to immediately disable the blade rotation when the user is no longer holding the handle. In the United States, over 12,000 people per year are hospitalized as a result of lawn mower accidents.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/lawn-mower-injury-alert/story?id=32059032 |title=Lawn Mower Injury Alert: What You Need to Know |last=News |first=A.

The height of the cut grass may be fixed by the design of the mower, but generally is adjustable by the operator, typically by a single master lever, or by a lever or nut and bolt on each of the machine's wheels. The blades may be powered by manual force, with wheels mechanically connected to the cutting blades so that when the mower is pushed forward, the blades spin, or the machine may have a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]-powered or [[AC power plugs and sockets|plug-in]] [[electric motor]]. The most common self-contained power source for lawn mowers is a small (typically [[Single-cylinder engine|one cylinder]]) [[internal combustion engine]]. Smaller mowers often lack any form of propulsion, requiring human power to move over a surface; \"walk-behind\" mowers are self-propelled, requiring a human only to walk behind and guide them. Larger lawn mowers are usually either self-propelled \"walk-behind\" types, or more often, are \"ride-on\" mowers, equipped so the operator can ride on the mower and control it. A [[robotic lawn mower]] (\"lawn-mowing bot\", \"mowbot\", etc.) is designed to operate either entirely on its own, or less commonly by an operator by [[remote control]].\n\nTwo main styles of blades are used in lawn mowers. Lawn mowers employing a single blade that rotates about a single vertical axis are known as rotary mowers, while those employing a cutting bar and multiple blade assembly that rotates about a single horizontal axis are known as cylinder or reel mowers (although in some versions, the cutting bar is the only blade, and the rotating assembly consists of flat metal pieces which force the blades of grass against the sharp cutting bar).\n\nThere are several types of mowers, each suited to a particular scale and purpose. The smallest types, non-powered push mowers, are suitable for small residential lawns and gardens. Electrical or piston engine-powered push-mowers are used for larger residential lawns (although there is some overlap). [[Riding mower]]s, which sometimes resemble small tractors, are larger than push mowers and are suitable for large lawns, although commercial riding lawn mowers (such as [[zero-turn mower]]s) can be \"stand-on\" types, and often bear little resemblance to residential lawn tractors, being designed to mow large areas at high speed in the shortest time possible. The largest multi-gang (multi-blade) mowers are mounted on [[tractor]]s and are designed for large expanses of grass such as [[golf course]]s and municipal parks, although they are ill-suited for complex terrain.\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|Lawn#History}}\n\n=== Invention ===\nThe first lawn mower was invented by [[Edwin Beard Budding|Edwin Budding]] in 1830<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldlawnmowerclub.co.uk/aboutmowers/history|title=Mower History|work=oldlawnmowerclub.co.uk}}</ref> in [[Brimscombe and Thrupp|Thrupp]], just outside [[Stroud]], in [[Gloucestershire]], England. Budding's mower was designed primarily to cut the grass on sports grounds and extensive gardens, as a superior alternative to the [[scythe]], and was granted a British patent on August 31, 1830.<ref>{{cite patent|inventor-last=Passmore |inventor-first=Everett G. |publication-date=23 February 1869 |issue-date=28 January 1879|title=Improvement in Lawn-Mowers |country-code=US |description=RE |patent-number=8560}}; see pg 1, col 2.

The mower was pushed from behind. [[Cast iron|Cast-iron]] [[Gear|gear wheels]] transmitted power from the rear roller to the cutting cylinder, allowing the rear roller to drive the knives on the cutting cylinder; the ratio was 16:1. Another roller placed between the cutting cylinder and the main or land roller could be raised or lowered to alter the height of cut. The grass clippings were hurled forward into a tray-like box. It was soon realized, however, that an extra handle was needed in front to help pull the machine along. Overall, these machines were remarkably similar to modern mowers.<ref name=\"oldlawnmowerclub1\">{{cite web|author=The Old Lawnmower Club | url=http://www.oldlawnmowerclub.co.uk/mowinfo/mowhist.htm |title=Mower History |publisher=The Old Lawnmower Club | date= |accessdate=2011-04-23}}</ref>\n\nTwo of the earliest Budding machines sold went to Regent's Park Zoological Gardens in London and the Oxford Colleges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hdtrust.co.uk/hist02.htm |title=The Hall & Duck Trust: Lawn Mower History Part 2 |publisher=Hdtrust.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-04-23}}</ref> In an agreement between John Ferrabee and Edwin Budding dated May 18, 1830, Ferrabee paid the costs of enlarging the small blades, obtained letters of patent and acquired rights to manufacture, sell and license other manufacturers in the production of lawn mowers. Without patent,{{clarify|date=January 2018}} Budding and Ferrabee were shrewd enough to allow other companies to build copies of their mower under license, the most successful of these being Ransomes of Ipswich, which began making mowers as early as 1832.<ref name=\"oldlawnmowerclub1\"/>\n\nHis machine was the catalyst for the preparation of modern-style sporting ovals, [[Pitch (sports field)|playing fields]] (pitches), [[grass court]]s, etc. This led to the codification of modern rules for many sports, including for [[football]], [[Bowls|lawn bowls]], [[Tennis|lawn tennis]] and others.<ref>Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio National ''Ockham's Razor'', first broadcast 6 June 2010.</ref>\n\n=== Further improvements ===\n[[File:SLNSW 8483 The horsedrawn mower makes a vignette of a player putting.jpg|thumb|A horsedrawn lawn mower on an Australian golf course in the 1930s.]]\n[[File:Ransomes00.gif|Lawn mower advert|thumb|right|The first gasoline-powered lawn mower, 1902.]]\n\nIt took ten more years and further innovations to create a machine that could be drawn by animals, and sixty years before a steam-powered lawn mower was built. In the 1850s, [[Thomas Green & Son]] of [[Leeds]] introduced a mower called the Silens Messor (meaning silent cutter), which used a [[Chain drive|chain]] drive to transmit power from the rear roller to the cutting cylinder. These machines were lighter and quieter than the gear-driven machines that preceded them, although they were slightly more expensive.<ref name=\"oldlawnmowerclub1\"/> The rise in popularity of lawn sports helped prompt the spread of the invention. Lawn mowers became a more efficient alternative to the [[scythe]] and domesticated [[grazing]] animals.\n\nManufacture of lawn mowers took off in the 1860s. By 1862, Ferrabee's company was making eight models in various roller sizes. He manufactured over 5000 machines until production ceased in 1863. The first grass boxes were flat trays but took their present shape in the 1860s. James Sumner of [[Lancashire]] patented the first [[steam engine|steam-powered]] lawn mower in 1893. His machine burned petrol and/or paraffin ([[kerosene]]) as fuel. These were heavy machines that took several hours to warm up to operating pressure.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://backyardrefuge.com/history-of-the-lawn-mower/ | title=The History of the LawnMower | publisher=backyardrefuge.com | date= |accessdate=2018-11-19}}</ref> After numerous advances, these machines were sold by the Stott Fertilizer and Insecticide Company of [[Manchester]] and Sumner. The company they both controlled was called the [[Leyland Motors|Leyland Steam Motor Company]].\n\nAround 1900, one of the best known English machines was the [[Ransomes, Sims & Jefferies|Ransomes]]' Automaton, available in chain- or gear-driven models. Numerous manufacturers entered the field with petrol (gasoline) engine-powered mowers after the start of the 20th century. The first was produced by Ransomes in 1902. JP Engineering of Leicester, founded after [[World War I]], produced a range of very popular chain-driven mowers. About this time, an operator could ride behind animals that pulled the large machines. These were the first riding mowers.\n\nThe first United States patent for a reel lawn mower was granted to Amariah Hills on January 12, 1868.<ref name=\"about1\">{{cite web|author=mary bellis |url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/bllawns.htm |title=Greener Pastures \u2013 History of the Lawn Mower |publisher=Inventors.about.com |date=2010-06-16 |accessdate=2011-04-23}}</ref> In 1870, Elwood McGuire of Richmond, Indiana designed a human-pushed lawn mower, which was very lightweight and a commercial success. John Burr patented an improved rotary-blade lawn mower in 1899, with the wheel placement altered for better performance. Amariah Hills went on to found the Archimedean Lawn Mower Co. in 1871.\n\nIn the United States, gasoline-powered lawn mowers were first manufactured in 1914 by Ideal Power Mower Co. of [[Lansing, Michigan]], based on a patent by [[Ransom E. Olds]]. Ideal Power Mower also introduced the world's first self-propelled, riding lawn tractor in 1922, known as the \"Triplex\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reoldsmuseum.org/ideal-power-lawn-mower|title=Ideal Power Lawn Mower|work=reoldsmuseum.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://reoldsmuseum.org/lansing-lawnmowers|title=Lansing & Lawnmowers|work=reoldsmuseum.org}}</ref> The roller-drive lawn mower has changed very little since around 1930. ''Gang mowers'', those with multiple sets of blades to cut a wider swath, were built in the United States in 1919 by the [[Worthington Mower Company]].\n\n== Atco Ltd and the first motor mower ==\n{{main|Atco (British Mower Company)}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-09651, Elektrische Grasm\u00e4hmaschine.jpg|thumb|Commercial lawn mower in use April 1930 in Berlin.]]\n\nIn the 1920s one of the most successful companies to emerge during this period was Atco, at that time a brand name of Charles H Pugh Ltd. The Atco motor mower, launched in 1921 was an immediate success. Just 900 of the 22-inch-cut machines were made in 1921, each costing \u00a375. Within five years, annual production had accelerated to tens of thousands. Prices were reduced and a range of sizes was available, making the Standard the first truly mass-produced engine-powered mower.\n\n=== Rotary mowers ===\nRotary mowers were not developed until engines were small enough and powerful enough to run the blades at sufficient speed. Many people experimented with rotary blade mowers in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and Power Specialties Ltd. introduced a gasoline-powered rotary mower. Kut Kwick replaced the saw blade of the \"Pulp Saw\" with a double-edged blade and a cutter deck, converting the \"Pulp Saw\" into the first ever out-front rotary mower.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kutkwick.com/about.htm|title=About: An Industry Innovator for Over 70 Years|work=kutkwick.com}}</ref>\n\nOne company that produced rotary mowers commercially was the Australian [[Victa lawn mower|Victa]] company, starting in 1952. Its mowers were lighter and easier to use than similar ones that had come before. The first Victa mowers were made at [[Mortlake, New South Wales|Mortlake]], an inner suburb of [[Sydney]], by local resident Mervyn Victor Richardson. He made his first model out of scrap in his garage. The first Victa mowers were then manufactured, going on sale on 20 September 1952. The new company, Victa Mowers Pty Ltd, was incorporated on 13 February 1953.\n\nThe venture was so successful that by 1958 the company moved to much larger premises in [[Parramatta Road]], [[Concord, New South Wales|Concord]], and then to [[Milperra, New South Wales|Milperra]], by which time the mower incorporated an engine, designed and manufactured by Victa, which was specially designed for mowing, rather than employing a general-purpose engine bought from outside suppliers.<ref>{{cite web |title=How do you sell a million mowers? |url=http://hawkey.id.au/Victa%20History.php |archivedate=2009-06-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615030323/http://www.hawkey.id.au/Victa%20History.php}}</ref> Two Victa mowers, from 1958 and 1968 respectively, are held in the collection of the [[National Museum of Australia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/collections-search/results?QueryTerms=Victa&Limitpp=20&search=basic|title=Collection Explorer \u2013 National Museum of Australia|work=nma.gov.au}}</ref> The Victa mower is regarded as something of an Australian [[cultural icon|icon]], appearing en masse, in simulated form, at the [[2000 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|opening of the Sydney Olympic Games]] in 2000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXakbHyn7GE&t=626s|title=. . at 10mins 26 secs exact in this video}}</ref>\n\nThe hover mower, first introduced by [[Flymo]] in 1964, is a form of rotary mower using an air cushion on the [[hovercraft]] principle.\n\n== Types ==\n\n=== By rotation ===\n\n==== Cylinder or reel mowers ====\n\nA cylinder mower or reel mower carries a fixed, horizontal cutting blade at the desired height of cut. Over this is a fast-spinning reel of blades which force the grass past the cutting bar. Each blade in the blade cylinder forms a helix around the reel axis, and the set of spinning blades describes a cylinder.\n\nOf all the mowers, a properly adjusted cylinder mower makes the cleanest cut of the grass,<ref name=\"hessayon\">{{Cite book\n  |last=Hessayon\n  |first=D.G.\n  |authorlink=D. G. Hessayon\n  |year=2007\n  |title=The Lawn Expert\n  |publisher=Transworld Publishers\n  |location=London\n  |isbn=978-0-903505-48-2\n  |pages=[https://archive.org/details/newlawnexpert00hess/page/28 28\u201333]\n  |url-access=registration\n  |url=https://archive.org/details/newlawnexpert00hess/page/28\n  }}</ref> and this allows the grass to heal more quickly. The cut of a well-adjusted cylinder mower is straight and definite, as if cut with a pair of scissors. This clean cut promotes healthier, thicker and more resilient lawn growth that is more resistant to disease, weeds and parasites. Lawn cut with a cylinder mower is less likely to result in yellow, white or brown discolouration as a result of leaf shredding. While the cutting action is often likened to that of scissors, it is not necessary for the blades of the spinning cylinder to contact the horizontal cutting bar.<ref name=\"hessayon\" /> If the gap between the blades is less than the thickness of the grass blades, a clean cut can still be made. If more, however, the grass will slip through. Reel mowers also have more difficulty mowing over uneven terrain.\n\nThere are many variants of the cylinder mower. Push mowers have no engine and are usually used on smaller lawn areas where access is a problem, where noise pollution is undesirable and where air pollution is unwanted. As the mower is pushed along, the wheels drive gears which rapidly spin the reel. Typical cutting widths are {{convert|10|to|16|in|mm}}. Advances in materials and engineering have resulted in these mowers being very light and easy to operate and manoeuvre compared with their predecessors while still giving all the cutting advantages of professional cylinder mowers. Their distinct environmental benefits, both in noise and air pollution, are also strong selling points, something not lost on many international zoos, animal sanctuaries and exclusive hotel groups.\n\nThe basic push mower mechanism is also used in gangs towed behind a [[tractor]]. The individual mowers are arranged in a \"v\" behind the tractor with each mower's track slightly overlapping that of the mower in front of it. Gang mowers are used over large areas of turf such as sports fields or parks.\n\nA gasoline engine or electric motor can be added to a cylinder mower to power the cylinder, the wheels, the roller, or any combination of these. A typical arrangement on electric powered machines for residential lawns is for the motor to power the cylinder while the operator pushes the mower along. The electric models can be corded or cordless. On petrol machines the engine drives both the cylinder and the rear roller. Some variants have only three blades in a reel spinning at great speed, and these models are able to cut grass which has grown too long for ordinary push mowers.<ref name=\"hessayon\" /> One type of reel mower, now largely obsolete, was a powered version of the traditional side-wheel push mower, which was used on residential lawns. An internal combustion engine sat atop the reel housing and drove the wheels, usually through a belt. The wheels in turn drove the reel, as in the push mower.\n\nGreens mowers are used for the precision cutting of golf greens and have a cylinder made up of at least eight, but normally ten, blades. The machine has a roller before and after the cutting cylinder which smooths the freshly cut lawn and minimizes wheel marks. Due to the weight, the engine also propels the mower. Much smaller and lighter variants of the roller mower are sometimes used for small patches of ornamental lawns around flower beds, and these have no engine.<ref name=\"hessayon\" />\n\nRiding reel mowers are also produced. Typically, the cutting reels are ahead of the vehicle's main wheels, so that the grass can be cut before the wheels push the grass over onto the ground. The reels are often hydraulically powered.\n\nThe main parts of a cylinder or reel mower are:\n\n* '''Blade reel/cylinder:''' Consists of numerous (3 to 7) helical blades that are attached to a rotating shaft. The blades rotate, creating a scissor-like cutting motion against the bed knife.\n* '''Bed knife:''' The stationary cutting mechanism of a cylinder/reel mower. This is a fixed horizontal blade that is mounted to the frame of the mower.\n* '''Body frame:''' The main structural frame of the mower onto which the other parts of the mower are mounted.\n* '''Wheels:''' Help propel the mower in action. Generally, reel mowers have two wheels.\n* '''Push handle:''' The \"power source\" of a manually operated reel mower. This is a sturdy T-shaped, rectangular, or trapezoidal handle that is connected to the frame, wheels and blade chamber.\n* '''Motor:''' The power source of a reel mower that is powered by gasoline or electricity.\n\n==== Rotary mowers ====\n[[Image:Electric mower underside.jpg|right|thumb|A rotary mower (viewed from underneath), with a [[mulch]]ing blade that rotates around the center.]]\n\nA rotary mower rotates about a vertical axis with the blade spinning at high speed relying on impact to cut the grass. This tends to result in a rougher cut and bruises and shreds the grass leaf resulting in discolouration of the leaf ends as the shredded portion dies. This is particularly prevalent if the blades become clogged or blunt. Most rotary mowers need to be set a little higher than cylinder equivalents to avoid scalping and gouging of slightly uneven lawns, although some modern rotaries are fitted with a rear roller to provide a more formal striped cut. These machines will also tend to cut lower (13&nbsp;mm) than a standard four-wheeled rotary.\n\nThe main parts of a rotary mower are:\n\n* '''Cutter deck housing:''' Houses the blade and the drive system of the mower. It is shaped to effectively eject the grass clippings from the mower.\n* '''Blade mounting and drive system:''' The blade of a rotary mower is usually mounted directly to the crankshaft of its engine, but it can be propelled by a hydraulic motor or a belt pulley system.\n* '''[[Mower blade]]:''' A blade that rotates in a horizontal plane (about a vertical axis). Some mowers have multiple blades. The blade features edges that are slightly curved upward to generate a continuous air flow as the blade rotates (as a [[fan (machine)|fan]]), thus creating a sucking and tearing action.\n* '''Engine/motor:''' May be powered by gasoline or electricity.\n* '''Wheels:''' Generally four wheels, two front and two rear. Some mowers have a roller in place of the rear wheels.\n\n=== By energy source ===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2018}}\n\n==== Gasoline (petrol) ====\nExtensive grass trimming was not common before the widespread application of the vertical shaft single cylinder gasoline/petrol engine. In the United States this development paralleled the market penetration of companies such as the [[Briggs & Stratton]] company of Wisconsin.\n\nMost rotary push mowers are powered by [[internal combustion engine]]s. Such engines are usually [[four-stroke engine]]s, used for their greater torque and cleaner combustion (although a number of older models used [[two-stroke engine]]s), running on [[gasoline]] (petrol) or other [[liquid fuel]]s. Internal combustion engines used with lawn mowers normally have only one cylinder. Power generally ranges from four to seven [[horsepower]]. The engines usually have a [[carburetor]] and require a [[Recoil start|manual pull crank]] to start them, although an [[Starter (engine)|electric starter]] is offered on some models, particularly large riding and commercial mowers. Some mowers have a [[Throttle#Internal combustion engines|throttle control]] on the handlebar with which the operator can adjust the engine speed. Other mowers have a fixed, pre-set engine speed. All are equipped with a [[Governor (device)#Small engines|governor]] (often centrifugal/mechanical or air vane style) to open the throttle as needed to maintain the pre-selected speed when the force needed to cut the thicker or taller grass is encountered.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.briggsandstratton.com/na/en_us/support/faqs/browse/governor-system.html|title=How does a small engine governor work? {{!}} Briggs & Stratton|website=www.briggsandstratton.com|access-date=2018-03-22}}</ref> Gasoline mowers have the advantages over electric mowers of greater power and distance range.

Both are relatively quiet, typically producing less than 75 decibels, while a gasoline lawn mower can be 95 decibels or more.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Hollis |first=Scott |date=April\u2013May 2005 |title=Lawn Mowers: Cordless and Electric  |url=https://www.motherearthnews.com/homesteading-and-livestock/lawn-mowers-cordless-electric-zmaz05amzsel |magazine=[[Mother Earth News]] |volume=67 |issue=4 |page=209 |access-date=24 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nCorded electric mowers are limited in range by their trailing power cord, which may limit their use with lawns extending outward more than 100\u2013150 feet (30\u201345 m) from the nearest available power outlet. There is the additional hazard with these machines of accidentally mowing over the power cable, which stops the mower and may put users at risk of receiving a dangerous [[electric shock]]. Installing a [[residual-current device]] (GFCI) on the outlet may reduce the shock risk.\n\nCordless electric mowers are powered by a variable number (typically 1\u20134) of 12-volt, 56-volt, and 80-volt [[Rechargeable battery|rechargeable batteries]]. Typically, more [[Electric battery|batteries]] mean more run time and/or power (and more [[weight]]). Batteries can be in the interior of the lawn mower or on the outside. If on the outside, the depleted batteries can be quickly swapped with recharged batteries. Cordless mowers have the maneuverability of a gasoline-powered mower and the environmental friendliness of a corded electric mower, but they are more expensive and come in fewer models (particularly the self-propelling type) than either. The eventual disposal of worn-out batteries is problematic (though some manufacturers offer to recycle them), and the motors in some cordless mowers tend to be less powerful than gasoline motors of the same total weight (including batteries).\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"160px\">\nImage:Automower.jpg|Robotic mower.\nImage:Hover-mower.jpg|Hover mower (''underside view'').\nFile:CC500BAT.png|Cordless and rechargeable rotary lawn mower, in mulch mode, removable battery located above rear wheels\nImage:Electric mower-250px.jpg|Corded rotary lawn mower, with rear grass catcher (note the red cord attached at the handle).\n</gallery>\n\n==== By hand ====\nIn hand-powered lawn mowers, the reel is attached to the mower's wheels by gears, so that when the mower is pushed forward, the reel spins several times faster than the plastic or rubber-tired wheels turn. Depending on the placement of the reel, these mowers often cannot cut grass very close to lawn obstacles.\n\n=== Other notable types ===\n'''Hover mowers''' are powered rotary push lawn mowers that use an impeller above the spinning blades to drive air downward, thereby creating an air cushion that lifts the mower above the ground. The operator can then easily move the mower as it floats over the grass. Hover mowers are necessarily light in order to achieve the air cushion and typically have [[plastic]] bodies with an electric motor. The most significant disadvantage, however, is the cumbersome usability in rough terrain or on the edges of lawns, as the lifting air-cushion is destroyed by wide gaps between the chassis and the ground. Hover mowers are built to operate on steep slopes, waterfronts, and high-weeded areas, so they are often used by golf course [[greenskeeper]]s and commercial landscapers. Grass collection is often available, but can be poor in some models. The quality of cut can be inferior if the grass is pushed away from the blade by the cushion of air.\n\nA '''[[robotic mower]]''' is contained by a border wire around the lawn that defines the area to be mowed. The robot uses this wire to locate the boundary of the area to be trimmed and in some cases to locate a recharging dock. Robotic mowers are capable of maintaining up to {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of grass. Robotic lawn mowers are increasingly sophisticated, are usually self-docking and contain rain sensors, nearly eliminating human interaction for mowing grass. Multiple robotic mowers can be used to mow an even larger area.\n\n'''Tractor pulled mowers''' are usually in the form of an attachment to a [[tractor]]. The attachments can simply function by the movement of the tractor similar to manual push cylinder mowers, but also sometimes may have powered moving blades. They are commonly mounted on either the side or the back of the tractor.\n\n{{Anchor|Riding mower}}'''Riding mowers''' (U.S. and Canada) or '''ride-on mowers''' (U.K. and Canada) are a popular alternative for large lawns. The operator is provided with a seat and controls on the mower and literally rides on the machine. Most use the horizontal rotating blade system, though usually with multiple blades. A common form of ride-on mower is the '''lawn tractor'''. These are usually designed to resemble a small [[tractor|agricultural tractor]], with the cutting deck mounted amidships between the front and rear axles.\n\nThe drives for these mowers are in several categories. The most common transmission for tractors is a manual transmission. The second most common transmission type is a form of [[continuously variable transmission]], called the hydrostatic transmission. These transmissions take several forms, from pumps driving separate motors, which may incorporate a gear reduction, to fully integrated units containing a pump, motor and gear reduction. Hydrostatic transmissions are more expensive than mechanical transmissions, but they are easier to use and can transmit greater torque to the wheels compared to a typical mechanical transmission. The least common drive type, and the most expensive, is electric.\n\nThere have been a number of attempts to replace hydrostatic transmissions with lower cost alternatives, but these attempts, which include variable belt types, e.g. MTD's \"Auto Drive\", and toroidal, have various performance or perception problems that have caused their market life to be short or their market penetration to be limited.\n\nRiding lawn mowers can often mount other devices, such as rototillers/rotavators, snow plows, snow blowers, yard vacuums, occasionally even front buckets or fork-lift tines (these are more properly known as \"lawn tractors\" in this case, being designed for a number of tasks). The ability to tow other devices is possible due the fact they have multiple gears, often up to 5 or 6 and variable top speeds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gardenknow.com/how-to-use-riding-lawn-mowers/ |title=How to Use Riding Lawn Mowers |publisher=Gardenknow.com |date= |accessdate=2019-06-03}}</ref>\n\nThe deck of a rotary mower is typically made of steel. Lighter steel is used on less expensive models, and heavier steel on more expensive models for durability. Other deck materials include [[aluminium]], which does not rust and is a staple of higher priced mowers, and hard composite plastic, which does not rust and is lighter and less expensive than aluminium. Electric mowers typically have a plastic deck.\n\nRiding mowers typically have an opening in the side or rear of the housing where the cut grass is expelled, as do most rotary lawn mowers. Some have a grass catcher attachment at the opening to bag the grass clippings.\n\n'''Mulching mowers''' use special [[mulch]]ing blades which are available for rotary mowers. The blade is designed to keep the clippings circulating underneath the mower until the clippings are chopped quite small. Other designs have twin blades to mulch the clippings to small pieces. This function has the advantages of forgoing the additional work collecting and disposing of grass clippings while reducing lawn waste in such a way that also creates convenient [[compost]] for the lawn, forgoing the expense and [[Fertilizer#Problems with inorganic fertilizer|adverse environmental effect]] of [[fertilizer]].\n\nMower manufacturers market their mowers as side discharge, 2-in-1, meaning bagging and mulching or side discharging and mulching, and 3-in-1, meaning bagging, mulching, and side discharge. Most 2-in-1 bagging and mulching mowers require a separate attachment to discharge grass onto the lawn. Some side discharge mower manufacturers also sell separate \"mulching plates\" that will cover the opening on the side discharge mower and, in combination with the proper blades, will convert the mower to a mulching mower. These conversions are impractical when compared with 2- or 3-in-1 mowers which can be converted in the field in seconds. There are two types of bagging mowers. A rear bag mower features an opening on the back of the mower through which the grass is expelled into the bag. Hi-vac mowers have a tunnel that extends from the side discharge to the bag. Hi-vac is also the type of grass collection used on some riding lawn mowers and lawn tractors and is suitable for use in dry conditions but less suitable for long wet lush grass as they often clog up. Mulching and bagging mowers are not well suited to long grass or thick weeds. In some ride-on mowers, the cut grass is dropped onto the ground and then collected by a set of rotating bristles, allowing even long, wet grass to be collected.\n\nRotary mowers with internal combustion engines come in three price ranges. Low priced mowers use older technology, smaller motors, and lighter [[steel]] decks. These mowers are targeted at the residential market and typically price is the most important selling point.\n\nProfessional grass-cutting equipment (used by large establishments such as universities, sports stadiums and local authorities) usually take the form of much larger, dedicated, ride-on platforms or attachments that can be mounted on, or behind, a standard tractor unit (a \"gang-mower\"). Either type may use rotating-blade or cylindrical-blade type cutters, although high-quality mowed surfaces demand the latter. Wide-area mowers (WAMs) are commercial grade mowers which have decks extended to either side, many to {{convert|12|ft|m}}. These extensions can be lowered for large area mowing or raised to decrease the mower's width and allow for easy transport on city roads or trailers. Commercial lawn-mowing companies have also enthusiastically adopted types such as the zero-turn mower (in both ride-on and stand-on versions), which allow high speed over the grass surface, and rapid turnaround at the end of rows, as well as excellent maneuverability around obstacles.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Wikimedia Conference 2015 photo by Pine - 36.jpg|A ride on mower being used to maintain a public garden (2015)\nFile:Ursus C360 PICT0076.jpg|A tractor-pulled mower.\nImage:Riding-mower-hbs.jpg|A [[zero-turn mower]]\n</gallery>\n\n== Safety issues ==\nRotary mowers can throw out debris with extreme velocity and energy.

For instance, the lion-pulled chariot described by Plutarch in his \"Life of Antony\".}} to provide rapid motive power. Chariots were used by armies as transport or mobile [[archery]] platforms, for hunting or for racing, and as a conveniently fast way to travel for many ancient people.\n\nThe word \"chariot\" comes from the [[Latin]] term '''''carrus''''' (whence also ''[[car]]''), a loanword from [[Gaulish]]. A chariot of war or one used in military parades was called a ''car''. In [[ancient Rome]] and some other [[Ancient history#Europe and Mediterranean|ancient Mediterranean civilizations]], a ''[[Biga (chariot)|biga]]'' required two horses, a ''[[Triga (chariot)|triga]]'' three, and a ''[[quadriga]]'' four.\n\nThe chariot was a fast, light, open, two-[[wheel]]ed conveyance drawn by two or more horses that were hitched side by side, and was little more than a floor with a waist-high guard at the front and sides. It was initially used for [[ancient warfare]] during the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age|Iron]] Ages; but, after its military capabilities had been superseded by cavalry, as horses were gradually bred to be bigger, the chariot was used for [[travel]], in [[Parade|processions]], for [[game]]s, and in [[Chariot racing|races]].\n\nThe critical invention that allowed the construction of light, horse-drawn chariots was the [[spoke]]d [[wheel]]. The earliest spoke-wheeled chariots date to ca. 2000&nbsp;BC. Many notable conflicts were waged using chariots, such as the [[Battle of Kadesh]]. Chariots had lost their military importance by the 1st century&nbsp;AD, but [[Chariot racing|chariot races]] continued to be popular for [[chariot racing]] and military ceremonies.\n\n== History ==\nA necessary precursor to the invention of the chariot is the [[domestication of animals]], specifically [[domestication of the horse|horses]] \u2013 a major step in the development of civilization. Despite the large impact horse domestication has had in transport and communication, tracing its origins has been challenging.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title=The Earliest Horse Harnessing and Milking|last=Ak|first=Outram|last2=Na|first2=Stear|date=2009-03-06|language=en|pmid=19265018|last3=R|first3=Bendrey|last4=S|first4=Olsen|last5=A|first5=Kasparov|last6=V|first6=Zaibert|last7=N|first7=Thorpe|last8=Rp|first8=Evershed|journal = Science|volume = 323|issue = 5919|pages = 1332\u20135|doi = 10.1126/science.1168594}}</ref> Evidence supports horses were domesticated in the [[Eurasian Steppe]]s, with studies suggesting the [[Botai culture]] in modern day [[Kazakhstan]] being the first, about 3500 BCE .<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe origins of chariots and its use in warfare is obscure.

The second depicts a quadriga, with six-spoked wheels, and a driver standing up in a large chariot box. This chariot is being attacked. One figure, who is armed with a shield and a mace, stands in the chariot's path; another figure, who is armed with bow and arrow, threatens the right flank.

It built heavily fortified settlements, engaged in [[Bronze Age|bronze]] metallurgy on an industrial scale and practiced complex burial rituals reminiscent of [[Hindu]] rituals known from the ''[[Rigveda]]'' and the ''[[Avesta]]''.\n\nOver the next few centuries, the [[Andronovo culture]] spread across the steppes from the [[Urals]] to the [[Tien Shan]], likely corresponding to the time of early [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian cultures]].\n\nChariots figure prominently in Indo-Iranian mythology. Chariots are also an important part of both [[Hindu mythology|Hindu]] and [[Persian mythology]], with most of the gods in their [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] portrayed as riding them. The [[Sanskrit]] word for a chariot is ''r\u00e1tha-'' ([[Masculine gender|m.]]), which is cognate with [[Avestan language|Avestan]] ''ra\u03b8a-'' (also m.), and in origin a substantiation of the adjective [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''{{PIE|*rot-h\u2082-\u00f3-}}'' meaning \"having wheels\", with the characteristic accent shift found in Indo-Iranian substantivisations. This adjective is in turn derived from the collective noun ''{{PIE|*rot-eh\u2082-}}'' \"wheels\", continued in Latin ''rota'', which belongs to the noun ''{{PIE|*r\u00f3t-o-}}'' for \"wheel\" (from ''{{PIE|*ret-}}'' \"to run\") that is also found in Germanic, Celtic and Baltic ([[Old High German]] ''rad'' n., [[Old Irish]] ''roth'' m., [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''r\u00e3tas'' m.).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rix|first1=Helmut|title=Lexikon der indogermanischen Verben|last2=K\u00fcmmel|first2=Martin|last3=Zehnder|first3=Thomas|last4=Lipp|first4=Reiner|last5=Schirmer|first5=Brigitte|date=2001|publisher=Ludwig Reichert|isbn=3-89500-219-4|edition=2nd|location=Wiesbaden|page=507|language=German|title-link=Lexikon der indogermanischen Verben}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest depiction of vehicles in the context of warfare is on the [[Standard of Ur]] in southern Mesopotamia, c. 2500 BC.

The chariots of the Egyptians and Assyrians, with whom the bow was the principal arm of attack, were richly mounted with quivers full of arrows. The Egyptians invented the yoke saddle for their chariot horses in c. 1500 BC. As a general rule, the Egyptians used chariots as mobile archery platforms; chariots always had two men, with the driver steering the chariot with his reins while the main archer aimed his bow and arrow at any targets within range. The best preserved examples of Egyptian chariots are the four specimens from the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]]. Chariots can be carried by two or more horses.\n\n===Hittites===\n[[File:Hittite Chariot.jpg|left|thumb|[[Hittites|Hittite]] chariot (drawing of an [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] relief)]]\n\nThe oldest testimony of chariot warfare in the ancient Near East is the [[Hittite language|Old Hittite]] [[Anitta text]] (18th century BC), which mentions 40 teams of horses (in the original [[cuneiform]] spelling: 40 ''\u1e62\u00cd-IM-TI'' AN\u0160E.KUR.RA<sup>\u1e2aI.A</sup>) at the siege of [[Salatiwara]]. Since the text mentions ''teams'' rather than ''chariots'', the existence of chariots in the 18th century BC is uncertain. The first certain attestation of chariots in the Hittite empire dates to the late 17th century BC ([[Hattusili I]]). A Hittite horse-training text is attributed to [[Kikkuli the Mitanni]] (15th century BC).\n\nThe [[Hittites]] were renowned charioteers. They developed a new chariot design that had lighter wheels, with four spokes rather than eight, and that held three rather than two warriors. It could hold three warriors because the wheel was placed in the middle of the chariot and not at the back as in Egyptian chariots. Typically one Hittite warrior steered the chariot while the second man was usually the main archer; the third warrior would either wield a spear or sword when charging at enemies or hold up a large shield to protect himself and the others from enemy arrows.\n\nHittite prosperity largely depended on their control of trade routes and natural resources, specifically metals. As the Hittites gained dominion over Mesopotamia, tensions flared among the neighboring [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Hurrian]]s, and [[Egyptians]]. Under [[Suppiluliuma I]], the Hittites conquered [[Kadesh (Syria)|Kadesh]] and, eventually, the whole of [[Syria]]. The [[Battle of Kadesh]] in 1274 BC is likely to have been the largest chariot battle ever fought, involving over 5,000 chariots.<ref>{{cite book|first=Aaron |last=Ralby |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/atlasofworldmili0000ralb |title=Atlas of Military History |publisher=Parragon |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-4723-0963-1 |pages=54\u201355 |chapter=Battle of Kadesh, c. 1274 BC: Clash of Empires|chapter-url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n===Persia===\n{{Main|Scythed chariot}}\n[[File:Oxus chariot model.jpg|thumb|A golden chariot made during [[Achaemenid Empire]] (550\u2013330 BC).]]\nThe [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] succeeded [[Elam]] in the mid 1st millennium. They may have been the first to yoke four horses to their chariots. They also used [[scythed chariot]]s. [[Cyrus the Younger]] employed these chariots in large numbers at the [[Battle of Cunaxa]].\n\n[[Herodotus]] mentions that the [[Ancient Libya]]n and the [[Ancient India]]n ([[Sattagydia]], [[Gandhara]] and [[Hindush]]) [[satrapies]] supplied cavalry and chariots to [[Xerxes the Great]]'s army. However, by this time, [[cavalry]] was far more effective and agile than the chariot, and the defeat of [[Darius III]] at the [[Battle of Gaugamela]] (331 BC), where the army of Alexander simply opened their lines and let the chariots pass and attacked them from behind, marked the end of the era of chariot warfare (barring the Seleucid and Pontic powers, India, China, and the Celtic peoples).\n\n==Ancient Europe==\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nThe Abduction of Persephone by Pluto, Amphipolis.jpg|A [[mosaic]] of the [[Kasta Tomb]] in [[Amphipolis]] depicting the abduction of [[Persephone]] by [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], 4th century BC.\n2547 - Milano - Museo archeologico - Piatto apulo - Foto di Giovanni Dall'Orto - 1 feb 2014.jpg|The [[Nike (mythology)|goddess Nike]] riding on a two-horse chariot, from an [[Apulia]]n [[patera]] (tray), [[Magna Graecia]], 4th century BC.\nParade charriots Louvre CA2503.jpg|Procession of chariots on a [[Geometric art|Late Geometric]] [[amphora]] from Athens (ca. 720\u2013700 BC).\n</gallery>\n\n====Greece====\n[[File:Delphi charioteer front DSC06255.JPG|left|thumb|upright=.75|The ''[[Charioteer of Delphi]]'' was dedicated to the god [[Apollo]] in 474 BC by the tyrant of [[Gela#Ancient era|Gela]] in commemoration of a [[Pythian games|Pythian racing victory]] at [[Delphi]].]]\n\nThe latter [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] of the first millennium BC had a (still not very effective) [[cavalry]] arm (indeed, it has been argued that these early horseback riding soldiers may have given rise to the development of the later, heavily armed foot-soldiers known as hoplites<ref>{{cite web |title=BABESCH Annual Papers on Mediterranean Archaeology |url=https://www.babesch.org/82brouwers.html |website=From Horsemen to Hoplites |accessdate=December 31, 2019}}</ref>), and the rocky terrain of the [[Geography of Greece|Greek mainland]] was unsuited for wheeled vehicles. Consequently, in historical Greece the chariot was never used to any extent in war. Nevertheless, the chariot retained a high status and memories of its era were handed down in [[epic poetry]]. [[Linear B]] tablets from Mycenaean palaces record large inventories of chariots, sometimes with specific details as to how many chariots were assembled or not (i.e. stored in modular form). Later the vehicles were used in games and processions, notably for races at the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic]] and [[Panathenaic Games]] and other public festivals in ancient Greece, in ''[[hippodrome]]s'' and in contests called ''[[agon]]s''. They were also used in ceremonial functions, as when a ''[[paranymph]]'', or friend of a bridegroom, went with him in a chariot to fetch the bride home.\n\n[[Herodotus]] (''Histories'', 5. 9) Reports that chariots were widely used in the [[Black Sea|Pontic]]\u2013[[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] steppe by the [[Sigynnae]].\n\nGreek chariots were made to be drawn by two [[horse]]s attached to a central pole. If two additional horses were added, they were attached on each side of the main pair by a single bar or ''trace'' fastened to the front or ''prow'' of the chariot, as may be seen on two prize [[vase]]s in the [[British Museum]] from the [[Panathenaic Games]] at [[Athens, Greece]], in which the driver is seated with feet resting on a board hanging down in front close to the legs of the horses. The biga itself consists of a seat resting on the axle, with a rail at each side to protect the driver from the wheels. Greek chariots appear to have lacked any other attachment for the horses, which would have made turning difficult.\n\nThe body or ''basket'' of the chariot rested directly on the [[axle]] (called ''beam'') connecting the two wheels. There was no [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], making this an uncomfortable form of transport. At the front and sides of the basket was a semicircular guard about 3&nbsp;ft (1 m) high, to give some protection from enemy attack. At the back the basket was open, making it easy to mount and dismount. There was no seat, and generally only enough room for the driver and one passenger.\n\nThe reins were mostly the same as those in use in the 19th century, and were made of leather and ornamented with studs of ivory or metal. The reins were passed through rings attached to the [[horse collar|collar]] bands or yoke, and were long enough to be tied round the waist of the charioteer to allow for defense.\n\nThe wheels and basket of the chariot were usually of wood, strengthened in places with bronze or iron. The wheels had from four to eight spokes and tires of bronze or iron. Due to the widely spaced spokes, the rim of the chariot wheel was held in tension over comparatively large spans. Whilst this provided a small measure of shock absorption, it also necessitated the removal of the wheels when the chariot was not in use, to prevent warping from continued weight bearing.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=J.

This story led to the archaic meaning of a ''phaeton'' as one who drives a chariot or coach, especially at a reckless or dangerous speed. [[Plato]], in his ''[[Chariot Allegory]]'', depicted a chariot drawn by two horses, one well behaved and the other troublesome, representing opposite impulses of human nature; the task of the charioteer, representing reason, was to stop the horses from going different ways and to guide them towards enlightenment.\n\nThe [[Greek language|Greek]] word for chariot, \u1f05\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1, ''h\u00e1rma'', is also used nowadays to denote a [[tank]], properly called \u03ac\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1 \u03bc\u03ac\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2, ''\u00e1rma m\u00e1kh\u0113s'', literally a \"combat chariot\".\n\n====Central and Northern Europe====\n[[File:Kiviksgraven slab 2.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[petroglyph]] in [[the King's Grave|a double burial]], c. 1000 BC (the [[Nordic Bronze Age]])]]\n\nThe [[Trundholm sun chariot]] is dated to c. 1400 BC (see [[Nordic Bronze Age]]). The horse drawing the solar disk runs on four wheels, and the Sun itself on two. All wheels have four spokes. The \"chariot\" comprises the solar disk, the axle, and the wheels, and it is unclear whether the sun is depicted as the chariot or as the passenger. Nevertheless, the presence of a model of a [[horse-drawn vehicle]] on two spoked wheels in Northern Europe at such an early time is astonishing.\n\nIn addition to the Trundholm chariot, there are numerous [[petroglyph]]s from the Nordic Bronze Age that depict chariots. One petroglyph, drawn on a stone slab in a [[the King's Grave|double burial]] from c. 1000 BC, depicts a biga with two four-spoked wheels.\n\nThe use of the [[composite bow]] in chariot warfare is not attested in northern Europe.\n\n====Western Europe and British Isles====\nThe [[Celts]] were famous for their chariots and modern English words like ''car'', ''carriage'' and ''carry'' are ultimately derived from the native [[Common Brittonic|Brythonic language]] ([[Welsh language|Modern Welsh]]: ''Cerbyd''). The word ''chariot'' itself is derived from the [[French language|Norman French]] ''charriote'' and shares a Celtic root ([[Gaulish]]: ''karros''). Some 20 [[Iron Age|iron-aged]] [[chariot burial]]s have been excavated in Britain, roughly dating from between 500 BC and 100 BC.

[[Julius Caesar]] provides the only significant eyewitness report of British chariot warfare:\n{{quote|\nTheir mode of fighting with their chariots is this: firstly, they drive about in all directions and throw their weapons and generally break the ranks of the enemy with the very dread of their horses and the noise of their wheels; and when they have worked themselves in between the troops of horse, leap from their chariots and engage on foot. The charioteers in the meantime withdraw some little distance from the battle, and so place themselves with the chariots that, if their masters are overpowered by the number of the enemy, they may have a ready retreat to their own troops. Thus they display in battle the speed of horse, [together with] the firmness of infantry; and by daily practice and exercise attain to such expertness that they are accustomed, even on a declining and steep place, to check their horses at full speed, and manage and turn them in an instant and run along the pole, and stand on the yoke, and thence betake themselves with the greatest celerity to their chariots again.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10657/10657.txt The Project Gutenberg EBook of \"De Bello Gallico\" and Other Commentaries by Caius Julius Caesar, translated by W.

From [[Tacitus]] (''[[Agricola (Tacitus)|Agricola]]'' 1.35\u201336) \"The plain between resounded with the noise and with the rapid movements of chariots and cavalry.\" The chariots did not win even their initial engagement with the Roman auxiliaries: \"Meantime the enemy's cavalry had fled, and the charioteers had mingled in the engagement of the infantry.\"\n\nLater through the centuries, the chariot became commonly known as the \"[[war wagon]]\". The \"war wagon\" was a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] development used to attack rebel or enemy forces on battle fields. The wagon was given slits for archers to shoot enemy targets, supported by infantry using pikes and flails and later for the invention of gunfire by hand-gunners; side walls were used for protection against archers, crossbowmen, the early use of gunpowder and cannon fire.\n\nIt was especially useful during the [[Hussite Wars]], ca. 1420, by [[Hussite]] forces rebelling in [[Bohemia]]. Groups of them could form defensive works, but they also were used as hardpoints for Hussite formations or as firepower in pincer movements. This early use of gunpowder and innovative tactics helped a largely peasant infantry stave off attacks by the [[Holy Roman Empire]]'s larger forces of mounted [[knight]]s.\n\n====Etruria====\n[[File:Etruscan chariot wheel.jpg|thumb|Detail of the [[Monteleone Chariot]] at the Met (c. 530 BC)]]\nThe only intact [[Monteleone chariot|Etruscan chariot]] dates to c. 530 BC and was uncovered as part of a [[chariot burial]] at [[Monteleone di Spoleto]].

The track could hold 12 chariots, and the two sides of the track were separated by a raised median termed the ''spina''. Chariot races continued to enjoy great popularity in [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times, in the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]], even after the [[Olympic Games]] had been disbanded, until their decline after the [[Nika riots]] in the 6th century. The starting gates were known as the Carceres.\n\nAn ancient Roman car or chariot drawn by four horses abreast together with the horses drawing it was called a ''[[Quadriga]]'', from the Latin ''quadriugi'' (of a team of four). The term sometimes meant instead the four horses without the chariot or the chariot alone. A three-horse chariot, or the three-horse team drawing it, was a ''triga'', from ''triugi'' (of a team of three). A two-horse chariot, or the two-horse team drawing it, was a ''biga'', from ''biugi''.\n\n== Ancient China ==\n{{Main|Chariot (China)}}\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nCharioteer figure, bronze, Eastern Zhou Dynasty.JPG|Bronze Chinese charioteer from the [[Warring States period]] (403\u2013221 BC).\nPowerful landlord in chariot.

From the 8th to 5th centuries BC the Chinese use of chariots reached its peak. Although chariots appeared in greater numbers, infantry often defeated charioteers in battle.\n\nMassed-chariot warfare became all but obsolete after the [[Warring States period|Warring-States Period]] (476\u2013221 BC). The main reasons were increased use of the [[crossbow]], use of long halberds up to 18 feet long and pikes up to 22 feet long, and the adoption of standard cavalry units, and the adaptation of [[mounted archer]]y from nomadic cavalry, which were more effective. Chariots would continue to serve as command posts for officers during the [[Qin dynasty]] (221\u2013206 BC) and the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BC-220 AD), while armored chariots were also used during the Han Dynasty against the [[Xiongnu]] Confederation in the [[Han\u2013Xiongnu War]] (133 BC to 89 AD), specifically at the [[Battle of Mobei]] (119 BC).\n\nBefore the Han Dynasty, the power of Chinese states and dynasties was often measured by the number of chariots they were known to have. A country of a thousand chariots ranked as a medium country, and a country of ten thousand chariots ranked as a huge and powerful country.<ref>[Mencius \u00b7 Liang Hui Huang (King the Hui of Liang, Hui is a posthumous name) Volume One] 'The kingslayer of a country of ten thousands chariots, must be the house of thousand chariots.

For instance, the lion-pulled chariot described by Plutarch in his \"Life of Antony\".}} to provide rapid motive power. Chariots were used by armies as transport or mobile [[archery]] platforms, for hunting or for racing, and as a conveniently fast way to travel for many ancient people.\n\nThe word \"chariot\" comes from the [[Latin]] term '''''carrus''''' (whence also ''[[car]]''), a loanword from [[Gaulish]]. A chariot of war or one used in military parades was called a ''car''. In [[ancient Rome]] and some other [[Ancient history#Europe and Mediterranean|ancient Mediterranean civilizations]], a ''[[Biga (chariot)|biga]]'' required two horses, a ''[[Triga (chariot)|triga]]'' three, and a ''[[quadriga]]'' four.\n\nThe chariot was a fast, light, open, two-[[wheel]]ed conveyance drawn by two or more horses that were hitched side by side, and was little more than a floor with a waist-high guard at the front and sides. It was initially used for [[ancient warfare]] during the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age|Iron]] Ages; but, after its military capabilities had been superseded by cavalry, as horses were gradually bred to be bigger, the chariot was used for [[travel]], in [[Parade|processions]], for [[game]]s, and in [[Chariot racing|races]].\n\nThe critical invention that allowed the construction of light, horse-drawn chariots was the [[spoke]]d [[wheel]]. The earliest spoke-wheeled chariots date to ca. 2000&nbsp;BC. Many notable conflicts were waged using chariots, such as the [[Battle of Kadesh]]. Chariots had lost their military importance by the 1st century&nbsp;AD, but [[Chariot racing|chariot races]] continued to be popular for [[chariot racing]] and military ceremonies.\n\n== History ==\nA necessary precursor to the invention of the chariot is the [[domestication of animals]], specifically [[domestication of the horse|horses]] \u2013 a major step in the development of civilization.

The chariots of the Egyptians and Assyrians, with whom the bow was the principal arm of attack, were richly mounted with quivers full of arrows. The Egyptians invented the yoke saddle for their chariot horses in c. 1500 BC. As a general rule, the Egyptians used chariots as mobile archery platforms; chariots always had two men, with the driver steering the chariot with his reins while the main archer aimed his bow and arrow at any targets within range. The best preserved examples of Egyptian chariots are the four specimens from the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]]. Chariots can be carried by two or more horses.\n\n===Hittites===\n[[File:Hittite Chariot.jpg|left|thumb|[[Hittites|Hittite]] chariot (drawing of an [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] relief)]]\n\nThe oldest testimony of chariot warfare in the ancient Near East is the [[Hittite language|Old Hittite]] [[Anitta text]] (18th century BC), which mentions 40 teams of horses (in the original [[cuneiform]] spelling: 40 ''\u1e62\u00cd-IM-TI'' AN\u0160E.KUR.RA<sup>\u1e2aI.A</sup>) at the siege of [[Salatiwara]]. Since the text mentions ''teams'' rather than ''chariots'', the existence of chariots in the 18th century BC is uncertain. The first certain attestation of chariots in the Hittite empire dates to the late 17th century BC ([[Hattusili I]]). A Hittite horse-training text is attributed to [[Kikkuli the Mitanni]] (15th century BC).\n\nThe [[Hittites]] were renowned charioteers. They developed a new chariot design that had lighter wheels, with four spokes rather than eight, and that held three rather than two warriors. It could hold three warriors because the wheel was placed in the middle of the chariot and not at the back as in Egyptian chariots. Typically one Hittite warrior steered the chariot while the second man was usually the main archer; the third warrior would either wield a spear or sword when charging at enemies or hold up a large shield to protect himself and the others from enemy arrows.\n\nHittite prosperity largely depended on their control of trade routes and natural resources, specifically metals. As the Hittites gained dominion over Mesopotamia, tensions flared among the neighboring [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Hurrian]]s, and [[Egyptians]]. Under [[Suppiluliuma I]], the Hittites conquered [[Kadesh (Syria)|Kadesh]] and, eventually, the whole of [[Syria]]. The [[Battle of Kadesh]] in 1274 BC is likely to have been the largest chariot battle ever fought, involving over 5,000 chariots.<ref>{{cite book|first=Aaron |last=Ralby |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/atlasofworldmili0000ralb |title=Atlas of Military History |publisher=Parragon |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-4723-0963-1 |pages=54\u201355 |chapter=Battle of Kadesh, c. 1274 BC: Clash of Empires|chapter-url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n===Persia===\n{{Main|Scythed chariot}}\n[[File:Oxus chariot model.jpg|thumb|A golden chariot made during [[Achaemenid Empire]] (550\u2013330 BC).]]\nThe [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] succeeded [[Elam]] in the mid 1st millennium. They may have been the first to yoke four horses to their chariots. They also used [[scythed chariot]]s. [[Cyrus the Younger]] employed these chariots in large numbers at the [[Battle of Cunaxa]].\n\n[[Herodotus]] mentions that the [[Ancient Libya]]n and the [[Ancient India]]n ([[Sattagydia]], [[Gandhara]] and [[Hindush]]) [[satrapies]] supplied cavalry and chariots to [[Xerxes the Great]]'s army. However, by this time, [[cavalry]] was far more effective and agile than the chariot, and the defeat of [[Darius III]] at the [[Battle of Gaugamela]] (331 BC), where the army of Alexander simply opened their lines and let the chariots pass and attacked them from behind, marked the end of the era of chariot warfare (barring the Seleucid and Pontic powers, India, China, and the Celtic peoples).\n\n==Ancient Europe==\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nThe Abduction of Persephone by Pluto, Amphipolis.jpg|A [[mosaic]] of the [[Kasta Tomb]] in [[Amphipolis]] depicting the abduction of [[Persephone]] by [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], 4th century BC.\n2547 - Milano - Museo archeologico - Piatto apulo - Foto di Giovanni Dall'Orto - 1 feb 2014.jpg|The [[Nike (mythology)|goddess Nike]] riding on a two-horse chariot, from an [[Apulia]]n [[patera]] (tray), [[Magna Graecia]], 4th century BC.\nParade charriots Louvre CA2503.jpg|Procession of chariots on a [[Geometric art|Late Geometric]] [[amphora]] from Athens (ca. 720\u2013700 BC).\n</gallery>\n\n====Greece====\n[[File:Delphi charioteer front DSC06255.JPG|left|thumb|upright=.75|The ''[[Charioteer of Delphi]]'' was dedicated to the god [[Apollo]] in 474 BC by the tyrant of [[Gela#Ancient era|Gela]] in commemoration of a [[Pythian games|Pythian racing victory]] at [[Delphi]].]]\n\nThe latter [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] of the first millennium BC had a (still not very effective) [[cavalry]] arm (indeed, it has been argued that these early horseback riding soldiers may have given rise to the development of the later, heavily armed foot-soldiers known as hoplites<ref>{{cite web |title=BABESCH Annual Papers on Mediterranean Archaeology |url=https://www.babesch.org/82brouwers.html |website=From Horsemen to Hoplites |accessdate=December 31, 2019}}</ref>), and the rocky terrain of the [[Geography of Greece|Greek mainland]] was unsuited for wheeled vehicles. Consequently, in historical Greece the chariot was never used to any extent in war. Nevertheless, the chariot retained a high status and memories of its era were handed down in [[epic poetry]]. [[Linear B]] tablets from Mycenaean palaces record large inventories of chariots, sometimes with specific details as to how many chariots were assembled or not (i.e. stored in modular form). Later the vehicles were used in games and processions, notably for races at the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic]] and [[Panathenaic Games]] and other public festivals in ancient Greece, in ''[[hippodrome]]s'' and in contests called ''[[agon]]s''. They were also used in ceremonial functions, as when a ''[[paranymph]]'', or friend of a bridegroom, went with him in a chariot to fetch the bride home.\n\n[[Herodotus]] (''Histories'', 5. 9) Reports that chariots were widely used in the [[Black Sea|Pontic]]\u2013[[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] steppe by the [[Sigynnae]].\n\nGreek chariots were made to be drawn by two [[horse]]s attached to a central pole. If two additional horses were added, they were attached on each side of the main pair by a single bar or ''trace'' fastened to the front or ''prow'' of the chariot, as may be seen on two prize [[vase]]s in the [[British Museum]] from the [[Panathenaic Games]] at [[Athens, Greece]], in which the driver is seated with feet resting on a board hanging down in front close to the legs of the horses. The biga itself consists of a seat resting on the axle, with a rail at each side to protect the driver from the wheels. Greek chariots appear to have lacked any other attachment for the horses, which would have made turning difficult.\n\nThe body or ''basket'' of the chariot rested directly on the [[axle]] (called ''beam'') connecting the two wheels. There was no [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], making this an uncomfortable form of transport. At the front and sides of the basket was a semicircular guard about 3&nbsp;ft (1 m) high, to give some protection from enemy attack. At the back the basket was open, making it easy to mount and dismount. There was no seat, and generally only enough room for the driver and one passenger.\n\nThe reins were mostly the same as those in use in the 19th century, and were made of leather and ornamented with studs of ivory or metal. The reins were passed through rings attached to the [[horse collar|collar]] bands or yoke, and were long enough to be tied round the waist of the charioteer to allow for defense.\n\nThe wheels and basket of the chariot were usually of wood, strengthened in places with bronze or iron. The wheels had from four to eight spokes and tires of bronze or iron. Due to the widely spaced spokes, the rim of the chariot wheel was held in tension over comparatively large spans. Whilst this provided a small measure of shock absorption, it also necessitated the removal of the wheels when the chariot was not in use, to prevent warping from continued weight bearing.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=J.

[[Plato]], in his ''[[Chariot Allegory]]'', depicted a chariot drawn by two horses, one well behaved and the other troublesome, representing opposite impulses of human nature; the task of the charioteer, representing reason, was to stop the horses from going different ways and to guide them towards enlightenment.\n\nThe [[Greek language|Greek]] word for chariot, \u1f05\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1, ''h\u00e1rma'', is also used nowadays to denote a [[tank]], properly called \u03ac\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1 \u03bc\u03ac\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2, ''\u00e1rma m\u00e1kh\u0113s'', literally a \"combat chariot\".\n\n====Central and Northern Europe====\n[[File:Kiviksgraven slab 2.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[petroglyph]] in [[the King's Grave|a double burial]], c. 1000 BC (the [[Nordic Bronze Age]])]]\n\nThe [[Trundholm sun chariot]] is dated to c. 1400 BC (see [[Nordic Bronze Age]]). The horse drawing the solar disk runs on four wheels, and the Sun itself on two. All wheels have four spokes. The \"chariot\" comprises the solar disk, the axle, and the wheels, and it is unclear whether the sun is depicted as the chariot or as the passenger. Nevertheless, the presence of a model of a [[horse-drawn vehicle]] on two spoked wheels in Northern Europe at such an early time is astonishing.\n\nIn addition to the Trundholm chariot, there are numerous [[petroglyph]]s from the Nordic Bronze Age that depict chariots. One petroglyph, drawn on a stone slab in a [[the King's Grave|double burial]] from c. 1000 BC, depicts a biga with two four-spoked wheels.\n\nThe use of the [[composite bow]] in chariot warfare is not attested in northern Europe.\n\n====Western Europe and British Isles====\nThe [[Celts]] were famous for their chariots and modern English words like ''car'', ''carriage'' and ''carry'' are ultimately derived from the native [[Common Brittonic|Brythonic language]] ([[Welsh language|Modern Welsh]]: ''Cerbyd''). The word ''chariot'' itself is derived from the [[French language|Norman French]] ''charriote'' and shares a Celtic root ([[Gaulish]]: ''karros''). Some 20 [[Iron Age|iron-aged]] [[chariot burial]]s have been excavated in Britain, roughly dating from between 500 BC and 100 BC. Virtually all of them were found in [[East Yorkshire]] \u2013 the exception was a find in 2001 in [[Newbridge, Edinburgh|Newbridge]], 10&nbsp;km west of [[Edinburgh]].\n\nThe Celtic chariot, which may have been called [[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Celtic/karbantos|''karbantos'']] in [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] (compare Latin ''carpentum''),<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Karl|first=Raimund|editor-first=John T|editor-last=Koch|editor-link=John T.

[[Julius Caesar]] provides the only significant eyewitness report of British chariot warfare:\n{{quote|\nTheir mode of fighting with their chariots is this: firstly, they drive about in all directions and throw their weapons and generally break the ranks of the enemy with the very dread of their horses and the noise of their wheels; and when they have worked themselves in between the troops of horse, leap from their chariots and engage on foot. The charioteers in the meantime withdraw some little distance from the battle, and so place themselves with the chariots that, if their masters are overpowered by the number of the enemy, they may have a ready retreat to their own troops. Thus they display in battle the speed of horse, [together with] the firmness of infantry; and by daily practice and exercise attain to such expertness that they are accustomed, even on a declining and steep place, to check their horses at full speed, and manage and turn them in an instant and run along the pole, and stand on the yoke, and thence betake themselves with the greatest celerity to their chariots again.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10657/10657.txt The Project Gutenberg EBook of \"De Bello Gallico\" and Other Commentaries by Caius Julius Caesar, translated by W.

According to [[Tacitus]] (''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' 14.35), [[Boudica]], queen of the [[Iceni]] and a number of other tribes in a formidable uprising against the occupying Roman forces, addressed her troops from a chariot in 61 AD:\n\n: \"Boudicca curru filias prae se vehens, ut quamque nationem accesserat, solitum quidem Britannis feminarum ductu bellare testabatur\"\n\n: ''Boudicca, with her daughters before her in a chariot, went up to tribe after tribe, protesting that it was indeed usual for Britons to fight under the leadership of women.''\n\nThe last mention of chariot use in battle seems to be at the [[Battle of Mons Graupius]], somewhere in modern Scotland, in 84 AD. From [[Tacitus]] (''[[Agricola (Tacitus)|Agricola]]'' 1.35\u201336) \"The plain between resounded with the noise and with the rapid movements of chariots and cavalry.\" The chariots did not win even their initial engagement with the Roman auxiliaries: \"Meantime the enemy's cavalry had fled, and the charioteers had mingled in the engagement of the infantry.\"\n\nLater through the centuries, the chariot became commonly known as the \"[[war wagon]]\". The \"war wagon\" was a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] development used to attack rebel or enemy forces on battle fields. The wagon was given slits for archers to shoot enemy targets, supported by infantry using pikes and flails and later for the invention of gunfire by hand-gunners; side walls were used for protection against archers, crossbowmen, the early use of gunpowder and cannon fire.\n\nIt was especially useful during the [[Hussite Wars]], ca. 1420, by [[Hussite]] forces rebelling in [[Bohemia]]. Groups of them could form defensive works, but they also were used as hardpoints for Hussite formations or as firepower in pincer movements. This early use of gunpowder and innovative tactics helped a largely peasant infantry stave off attacks by the [[Holy Roman Empire]]'s larger forces of mounted [[knight]]s.\n\n====Etruria====\n[[File:Etruscan chariot wheel.jpg|thumb|Detail of the [[Monteleone Chariot]] at the Met (c. 530 BC)]]\nThe only intact [[Monteleone chariot|Etruscan chariot]] dates to c. 530 BC and was uncovered as part of a [[chariot burial]] at [[Monteleone di Spoleto]].

In Erebuni ([[Yerevan]]), King Argishti of Urartu is depicted riding on a chariot which is dragged by two horses. The chariot has two wheels and each wheel has about eight spokes. This type of chariot was used around 800 BC.\n\n====Rome====\n[[File:Winner of a Roman chariot race.jpg|thumb|A winner of a Roman [[chariot racing|chariot race]]]]\n\nIn the [[Roman Empire]], chariots were not used for warfare, but for [[chariot racing]], especially in [[circus (building)|circuses]], or for triumphal processions, when they could be drawn by as many as ten horses or even by dogs, tigers, or ostriches{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}. There were four divisions, or ''factiones'', of charioteers, distinguished by the colour of their costumes: the red, blue, green and white teams. The main centre of chariot racing was the [[Circus Maximus]],<ref>[http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Post/885645 The Charioteer of Delphi: Circus Maximus.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316221124/http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Post/885645 |date=March 16, 2008 }} The Roman Mysteries books by Caroline Lawrence.</ref> situated in the valley between the [[Palatine Hill|Palatine]] and [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]] Hills in Rome. The track could hold 12 chariots, and the two sides of the track were separated by a raised median termed the ''spina''. Chariot races continued to enjoy great popularity in [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times, in the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]], even after the [[Olympic Games]] had been disbanded, until their decline after the [[Nika riots]] in the 6th century. The starting gates were known as the Carceres.\n\nAn ancient Roman car or chariot drawn by four horses abreast together with the horses drawing it was called a ''[[Quadriga]]'', from the Latin ''quadriugi'' (of a team of four). The term sometimes meant instead the four horses without the chariot or the chariot alone. A three-horse chariot, or the three-horse team drawing it, was a ''triga'', from ''triugi'' (of a team of three). A two-horse chariot, or the two-horse team drawing it, was a ''biga'', from ''biugi''.\n\n== Ancient China ==\n{{Main|Chariot (China)}}\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nCharioteer figure, bronze, Eastern Zhou Dynasty.JPG|Bronze Chinese charioteer from the [[Warring States period]] (403\u2013221 BC).\nPowerful landlord in chariot.

[[Oracle bone inscription]]s suggest that the western enemies of the Shang used limited numbers of chariots in battle, but the Shang themselves used them only as mobile command-vehicles and in royal hunts.<ref>{{Cite journal|last= Shaughnessy |first= Edward L. |title= Historical Perspectives on The Introduction of The Chariot Into China |journal= Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies |volume= 48 |issue= 1 |year= 1988 |pages= 189\u2013237 |doi= 10.2307/2719276 |publisher= Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies, Vol. 48, No. 1 |jstor= 2719276}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Shang Dynasty, members of the royal family were buried with a complete household and servants, including a chariot, horses, and a charioteer. A Shang chariot was often drawn by two horses, but four-horse variants are occasionally found in burials.\n\n[[Jacques Gernet]] claims that the [[Zhou dynasty]], which conquered the Shang ca. 1046 BC, made more use of the chariot than did the Shang and \"invented a new kind of harness with four horses abreast\".<ref>Gernet, Jacques. ''A History of Chinese Civilization'', Cambridge University Press, 2nd edition 1996, {{ISBN|0-521-49781-7}}, p. 51.</ref> The crew consisted of an archer, a driver, and sometimes a third warrior who was armed with a spear or [[dagger-axe]]. From the 8th to 5th centuries BC the Chinese use of chariots reached its peak. Although chariots appeared in greater numbers, infantry often defeated charioteers in battle.\n\nMassed-chariot warfare became all but obsolete after the [[Warring States period|Warring-States Period]] (476\u2013221 BC). The main reasons were increased use of the [[crossbow]], use of long halberds up to 18 feet long and pikes up to 22 feet long, and the adoption of standard cavalry units, and the adaptation of [[mounted archer]]y from nomadic cavalry, which were more effective. Chariots would continue to serve as command posts for officers during the [[Qin dynasty]] (221\u2013206 BC) and the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BC-220 AD), while armored chariots were also used during the Han Dynasty against the [[Xiongnu]] Confederation in the [[Han\u2013Xiongnu War]] (133 BC to 89 AD), specifically at the [[Battle of Mobei]] (119 BC).\n\nBefore the Han Dynasty, the power of Chinese states and dynasties was often measured by the number of chariots they were known to have. A country of a thousand chariots ranked as a medium country, and a country of ten thousand chariots ranked as a huge and powerful country.<ref>[Mencius \u00b7 Liang Hui Huang (King the Hui of Liang, Hui is a posthumous name) Volume One] 'The kingslayer of a country of ten thousands chariots, must be the house of thousand chariots.

The slot corresponding to its uppercase form is occupied by the lowercase letter ''[[\u00df]]'' from the German language, which did not have an [[Capital \u1e9e|uppercase form]] at the time when the standard was created.\n\n=== Quotation marks ===\nFor some languages listed above, the correct typographical [[Quotation mark#Summary table|quotation marks]] are missing, as only {{code|\u00ab \u00bb}}, {{code|\" \"}}, and {{code|' '}} are included. Also, this scheme does not provide for oriented (6- or 9-shaped) single or double quotation marks. Some fonts will display the spacing grave accent (0x60) and the apostrophe (0x27) as a matching pair of oriented single quotation marks, but this is not considered part of the modern standard.\n\n== History ==\nISO 8859-1 was based on the [[Multinational Character Set]] used by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) in the popular [[VT220]] terminal in 1983. It was developed within the [[Ecma International|European Computer Manufacturers Association]] (ECMA), and published in March 1985 as ECMA-94,<ref name=\"ECMA_1985_ECMA94_R1\" /> by which name it is still sometimes known. The second edition of ECMA-94 (June 1986)<ref>[https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-094.pdf second edition of ECMA-94 (June 1986)]</ref> also included [[ISO/IEC 8859-2|ISO 8859-2]], [[ISO/IEC 8859-3|ISO 8859-3]], and [[ISO/IEC 8859-4|ISO 8859-4]] as part of the specification.\n\nThe original draft of ISO 8859-1 placed French ''\u0152'' and ''\u0153'' at code points 215 (0xD7) and 247 (0xF7), as in the ECMA-94. However, the delegate from France, being neither a linguist nor a typographer, falsely stated that these are not independent French letters on their own, but mere [[Orthographic ligature|ligatures]] (like ''\ufb01'' or ''\ufb02''), supported by the delegate team from [[Bull Publishing Company]], who regularly did not print French with ''\u0152/\u0153'' in their house style at the time. An anglophone delegate from Canada insisted in retaining ''\u0152/\u0153'' but was rebuffed by the French delegate and the team from Bull. These code points were soon filled with \u00d7 and \u00f7 under the suggestion of the German delegation. Then things went even worse for the French language, when it was again falsely stated that the letter ''\u00ff'' is \"not French\", resulting in the absence of the capital ''\u0178''. In fact, the letter ''\u00ff'' is found in a number of French proper names, and the capital letter has been used in dictionaries and encyclopedias.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jacques|first=Andr\u00e9|title=ISO Latin-1, norme de codage des caract\u00e8res europ\u00e9ens?

|quote=[\u2026] Since 1982 the urgency of the need for an 8-bit single-byte coded character set was recognized in ECMA as well as in ANSI/X3L2 and numerous working papers were exchanged between the two groups. In February 1984 ECMA TC1 submitted to ISO/TC97/SC2 a proposal for such a coded character set. At its meeting of April 1984 SC decided to submit to TC97 a proposal for a new item of work for this topic. Technical discussions during and after this meeting led TC1 to adopt the coding scheme proposed by X3L2. Part 1 of Draft International Standard DTS 8859 is based on this joint ANSI/ECMA proposal. [\u2026] Adopted as an ECMA Standard by the General Assembly of Dec. 13\u201314, 1984. [\u2026] |df= }}</ref>}} In the original draft, however, \u0152 was at codepoint 215 (0xD7) and \u0153 was at codepoint 247 (0xF7).\n\n== Similar character sets ==\n{{Main|Western Latin character sets (computing)}}\n\n=== ISO/IEC 8859-15 ===\n[[ISO/IEC 8859-15]] was developed in 1999, as an update of ISO/IEC&nbsp;8859-1. It provides some characters for French and Finnish text and the [[euro sign]], which are missing from ISO/IEC&nbsp;8859-1. This required the removal of some infrequently used characters from ISO/IEC 8859-1, including fraction symbols and letter-free diacritics: {{code|\u00a4}}, {{code|\u00a6}}, {{code|\u00a8}}, {{code|\u00b4}}, {{code|\u00b8}}, {{code|\u00bc}}, {{code|\u00bd}}, and {{code|\u00be}}. Ironically, three of the newly added characters ({{code|\u0152}}, {{code|\u0153}}, and {{code|\u0178}}) had already been present in [[DEC (company)|DEC]]'s 1983 [[Multinational Character Set]] (MCS), the predecessor to ISO/IEC 8859-1 (1987). Since their original code points were now reused for other purposes, the characters had to be reintroduced under different, less logical code points.\n\nISO-IR-204, a more minor modification, had been registered in 1998, altering ISO-8859-1 by replacing the [[universal currency sign]] (\u00a4) with the euro sign<ref>{{citation|mode=cs1 |url=https://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/iso-ir/204.pdf |title=ISO-IR 204: Supplementary set for Latin-1 alternative with EURO SIGN |author=ITS Information Technology Standardization |publisher=ITSCJ/[[Information Processing Society of Japan|IPSJ]] |date=1998-09-16}}</ref> (the same substitution made by ISO-8859-15).\n\n=== Windows-1252 ===\nThe popular [[Windows-1252]] character set adds all the missing characters provided by [[ISO/IEC&nbsp;8859-15]], plus a number of typographic symbols, by replacing the rarely used C1 controls in the range 128 to 159 ([[hexadecimal|hex]] 80 to 9F). It is very common to mislabel Windows-1252 text as being in ISO-8859-1. A common result was that all the quotes and apostrophes (produced by \"smart quotes\" in word-processing software) were replaced with question marks or boxes on non-Windows operating systems, making text difficult to read. Many web browsers and e-mail clients will interpret ISO-8859-1 control codes as Windows-1252 characters, and that behavior was later standardized in [[HTML5]].<ref>{{cite web |last=van Kesteren |first=Anne |url=https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#names-and-labels |work=Encoding Standard |title=5.2 Names and labels |publisher=[[WHATWG]] |date=27 January 2015 |access-date=4 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204174315/https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#names-and-labels |archive-date=4 February 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Mac Roman ===\nThe [[Apple Macintosh]] computer introduced a character encoding called [[Mac Roman]] in 1984.

The slot corresponding to its uppercase form is occupied by the lowercase letter ''[[\u00df]]'' from the German language, which did not have an [[Capital \u1e9e|uppercase form]] at the time when the standard was created.\n\n=== Quotation marks ===\nFor some languages listed above, the correct typographical [[Quotation mark#Summary table|quotation marks]] are missing, as only {{code|\u00ab \u00bb}}, {{code|\" \"}}, and {{code|' '}} are included. Also, this scheme does not provide for oriented (6- or 9-shaped) single or double quotation marks. Some fonts will display the spacing grave accent (0x60) and the apostrophe (0x27) as a matching pair of oriented single quotation marks, but this is not considered part of the modern standard.\n\n== History ==\nISO 8859-1 was based on the [[Multinational Character Set]] used by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) in the popular [[VT220]] terminal in 1983. It was developed within the [[Ecma International|European Computer Manufacturers Association]] (ECMA), and published in March 1985 as ECMA-94,<ref name=\"ECMA_1985_ECMA94_R1\" /> by which name it is still sometimes known. The second edition of ECMA-94 (June 1986)<ref>[https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-094.pdf second edition of ECMA-94 (June 1986)]</ref> also included [[ISO/IEC 8859-2|ISO 8859-2]], [[ISO/IEC 8859-3|ISO 8859-3]], and [[ISO/IEC 8859-4|ISO 8859-4]] as part of the specification.\n\nThe original draft of ISO 8859-1 placed French ''\u0152'' and ''\u0153'' at code points 215 (0xD7) and 247 (0xF7), as in the ECMA-94. However, the delegate from France, being neither a linguist nor a typographer, falsely stated that these are not independent French letters on their own, but mere [[Orthographic ligature|ligatures]] (like ''\ufb01'' or ''\ufb02''), supported by the delegate team from [[Bull Publishing Company]], who regularly did not print French with ''\u0152/\u0153'' in their house style at the time. An anglophone delegate from Canada insisted in retaining ''\u0152/\u0153'' but was rebuffed by the French delegate and the team from Bull. These code points were soon filled with \u00d7 and \u00f7 under the suggestion of the German delegation. Then things went even worse for the French language, when it was again falsely stated that the letter ''\u00ff'' is \"not French\", resulting in the absence of the capital ''\u0178''. In fact, the letter ''\u00ff'' is found in a number of French proper names, and the capital letter has been used in dictionaries and encyclopedias.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jacques|first=Andr\u00e9|title=ISO Latin-1, norme de codage des caract\u00e8res europ\u00e9ens?

|quote=[\u2026] Since 1982 the urgency of the need for an 8-bit single-byte coded character set was recognized in ECMA as well as in ANSI/X3L2 and numerous working papers were exchanged between the two groups. In February 1984 ECMA TC1 submitted to ISO/TC97/SC2 a proposal for such a coded character set. At its meeting of April 1984 SC decided to submit to TC97 a proposal for a new item of work for this topic. Technical discussions during and after this meeting led TC1 to adopt the coding scheme proposed by X3L2. Part 1 of Draft International Standard DTS 8859 is based on this joint ANSI/ECMA proposal. [\u2026] Adopted as an ECMA Standard by the General Assembly of Dec. 13\u201314, 1984. [\u2026] |df= }}</ref>}} In the original draft, however, \u0152 was at codepoint 215 (0xD7) and \u0153 was at codepoint 247 (0xF7).\n\n== Similar character sets ==\n{{Main|Western Latin character sets (computing)}}\n\n=== ISO/IEC 8859-15 ===\n[[ISO/IEC 8859-15]] was developed in 1999, as an update of ISO/IEC&nbsp;8859-1. It provides some characters for French and Finnish text and the [[euro sign]], which are missing from ISO/IEC&nbsp;8859-1. This required the removal of some infrequently used characters from ISO/IEC 8859-1, including fraction symbols and letter-free diacritics: {{code|\u00a4}}, {{code|\u00a6}}, {{code|\u00a8}}, {{code|\u00b4}}, {{code|\u00b8}}, {{code|\u00bc}}, {{code|\u00bd}}, and {{code|\u00be}}. Ironically, three of the newly added characters ({{code|\u0152}}, {{code|\u0153}}, and {{code|\u0178}}) had already been present in [[DEC (company)|DEC]]'s 1983 [[Multinational Character Set]] (MCS), the predecessor to ISO/IEC 8859-1 (1987). Since their original code points were now reused for other purposes, the characters had to be reintroduced under different, less logical code points.\n\nISO-IR-204, a more minor modification, had been registered in 1998, altering ISO-8859-1 by replacing the [[universal currency sign]] (\u00a4) with the euro sign<ref>{{citation|mode=cs1 |url=https://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/iso-ir/204.pdf |title=ISO-IR 204: Supplementary set for Latin-1 alternative with EURO SIGN |author=ITS Information Technology Standardization |publisher=ITSCJ/[[Information Processing Society of Japan|IPSJ]] |date=1998-09-16}}</ref> (the same substitution made by ISO-8859-15).\n\n=== Windows-1252 ===\nThe popular [[Windows-1252]] character set adds all the missing characters provided by [[ISO/IEC&nbsp;8859-15]], plus a number of typographic symbols, by replacing the rarely used C1 controls in the range 128 to 159 ([[hexadecimal|hex]] 80 to 9F). It is very common to mislabel Windows-1252 text as being in ISO-8859-1. A common result was that all the quotes and apostrophes (produced by \"smart quotes\" in word-processing software) were replaced with question marks or boxes on non-Windows operating systems, making text difficult to read. Many web browsers and e-mail clients will interpret ISO-8859-1 control codes as Windows-1252 characters, and that behavior was later standardized in [[HTML5]].<ref>{{cite web |last=van Kesteren |first=Anne |url=https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#names-and-labels |work=Encoding Standard |title=5.2 Names and labels |publisher=[[WHATWG]] |date=27 January 2015 |access-date=4 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204174315/https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#names-and-labels |archive-date=4 February 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Mac Roman ===\nThe [[Apple Macintosh]] computer introduced a character encoding called [[Mac Roman]] in 1984. It was meant to be suitable for Western European [[desktop publishing]]. It is a superset of [[ASCII]], and has most of the characters that are in ISO-8859-1 and all the extra characters from Windows-1252 but in a totally different arrangement. The few printable characters that are in ISO 8859-1, but not in this set, are often a source of trouble when editing text on Web sites using older Macintosh browsers, including the last version of [[Internet Explorer for Mac]].\n\n=== Other ===\nDOS had [[code page 850]], which had all printable characters that ISO-8859-1 had (albeit in a totally different arrangement) plus the most widely used [[graphic character]]s from [[code page 437]].\n\nBetween 1989<ref name=\"HP82240B_1989\"/> and 2015,<!-- end of production of HP 50g, HP's last RPL calculator --> [[Hewlett-Packard]] used another superset of ISO-8859-1 on many of their calculators.
