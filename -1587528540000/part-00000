During this time period 1940-1960 it was supplied for free as the data was so valuable to EF Wonderlic. He wanted to perfect the test, not charge for it. In the 1970s [[Tom Landry]], coach of the [[Dallas Cowboys]], was the first to use the Wonderlic Personnel Test to predict player performance.<ref name=\"Pollick2003\"/> It is still used in the annual [[NFL Combine]] as a form of pre-draft assessment.<ref name=\"Pollick2003\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In short, it attempts to screen candidates for certain jobs within the shortest possible time.

The Wonderlic Personnel test is divided into two different forms of test: the Wonderlic Personnel Test - Quicktest (30 questions in 8 minutes) and the Wonderlic Personnel Test (50 questions, 12 minutes). The Wonderlic Personnel Test-Quicktest differs from the Wonderlic Personnel Test in that it is not proctored giving employers a general idea of the potential applicant's cognitive ability.

The Wonderlic Five-Factor Personality Profile and the Wonderlic Seven-Factor Personality Profile. The Wonderlic Five-Factor Personality Profile tests individuals on five primary dimensions of the individual's personality: [[extraversion]], [[agreeableness]], [[conscientiousness]], [[neuroticism|emotional stability/neuroticism]], and [[openness to experience]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Description of Five Factor Model|url=http://www.personality-and-aptitude-career-tests.com/five-factor-model.html|accessdate=April 10, 2012}}</ref> These are essentially the same [[Construct (philosophy of science)|constructs]] as the [[Big Five personality traits]], also known as the Five Factor Model.\n\n===Motivation===\nAveraging 10-15 minutes, the 58-item assessment is based on leading workplace motivation model, Holland/RIASEC. It evaluates a candidate\u2019s interests, which helps predict how motivated they will be by the actual responsibilities of the job.

New London''===\nIn May 1997, Robert Jordan filed a lawsuit against the city of [[New London, Connecticut]], alleging violation of the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the United States and Connecticut constitutions, in a case that was referred to by several media outlets as \"Too Smart To Be A Cop\",<ref>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/too-smart-to-be-a-cop/</ref><ref>https://slate.com/business/2013/05/too-smart-to-be-a-cop.html</ref> based on the city's application of scores generated by the Wonderlic test.\n\nJordan was born and raised in New London, and had previous experience in law enforcement, working as a part-time officer in near-by [[Groton Long Point]], and as a seasonal officer for the [[Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection]]. In fall 1996, Jordan requested an interview with Keith Harrigan, New London's Assistant City Manager in charge of personnel. Harrigan informed Jordan that he was ineligible because he scored too high on the written portion of the Wonderlic test intended to evaluate cognitive ability. New London had decided to consider only applicants who scored between 20 and 27 on the written examination. Jordan scored a 33 on the exam, the equivalent of having an IQ of 125. \n\nJordan filed suit in the [[United States District Court for the District of Connecticut]], where his case was dismissed by Judge Peter C. Dorsey, who noted: \"The guarantee of equal protection under the Fifth Amendment is not a source of substantive rights or liberties, but rather a right to be free from invidious discrimination in statutory classifications and other governmental activity. It is well settled that where a statutory classification does not itself impinge on a right or liberty protected by the Constitution, the validity of the classification must be sustained unless the classification rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of [any legitimate government] objective....[Jordan] may have been disqualified unwisely but he was not denied equal protection.\"<ref>http://www.aele.org/apa/jordan-newlondon.html</ref> The dismissal was upheld on appeal to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]].\n\n==Central tendency of Wonderlic scores==\n{{See also|Central tendency}}\nServing as a quantitative measure for employers, scores are collected by the employers and the applicant's score may be compared to a professional standard, as is the case with security guards or, simply, compared to the scores of other applicants who happen to be applying for the same or similar positions at that time.<ref name=Wonderlic1983>{{cite book|title=Wonderlic Personnel Test Manual|year=1983|publisher=E.F.

The Wonderlic Five-Factor Personality Profile tests individuals on five primary dimensions of the individual's personality: [[extraversion]], [[agreeableness]], [[conscientiousness]], [[neuroticism|emotional stability/neuroticism]], and [[openness to experience]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Description of Five Factor Model|url=http://www.personality-and-aptitude-career-tests.com/five-factor-model.html|accessdate=April 10, 2012}}</ref> These are essentially the same [[Construct (philosophy of science)|constructs]] as the [[Big Five personality traits]], also known as the Five Factor Model.\n\n===Motivation===\nAveraging 10-15 minutes, the 58-item assessment is based on leading workplace motivation model, Holland/RIASEC. It evaluates a candidate\u2019s interests, which helps predict how motivated they will be by the actual responsibilities of the job. The more motivated they are by those responsibilities, the likelier they will succeed in that position.<ref>[https://wonderlic.com/wonscore/motivation/ \"Motivation\"] ''Wonderlic.com''.

As a personnel test the Wonderlic is used to gauge an applicant's job potential, educational potential, and training potential.<ref name=\"Wonderlic1983\"/> Six forms of this test are made available (A, B, C, D, E, and F) in which Wonderlic suggests that when two of these versions are to be used, the best combinations are A and B or D and F.<ref name=\"Kazmier\">Kazmier, L.J. & Browne C.G.(1959).

New London''===\nIn May 1997, Robert Jordan filed a lawsuit against the city of [[New London, Connecticut]], alleging violation of the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the United States and Connecticut constitutions, in a case that was referred to by several media outlets as \"Too Smart To Be A Cop\",<ref>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/too-smart-to-be-a-cop/</ref><ref>https://slate.com/business/2013/05/too-smart-to-be-a-cop.html</ref> based on the city's application of scores generated by the Wonderlic test.\n\nJordan was born and raised in New London, and had previous experience in law enforcement, working as a part-time officer in near-by [[Groton Long Point]], and as a seasonal officer for the [[Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection]]. In fall 1996, Jordan requested an interview with Keith Harrigan, New London's Assistant City Manager in charge of personnel. Harrigan informed Jordan that he was ineligible because he scored too high on the written portion of the Wonderlic test intended to evaluate cognitive ability. New London had decided to consider only applicants who scored between 20 and 27 on the written examination. Jordan scored a 33 on the exam, the equivalent of having an IQ of 125. \n\nJordan filed suit in the [[United States District Court for the District of Connecticut]], where his case was dismissed by Judge Peter C. Dorsey, who noted: \"The guarantee of equal protection under the Fifth Amendment is not a source of substantive rights or liberties, but rather a right to be free from invidious discrimination in statutory classifications and other governmental activity. It is well settled that where a statutory classification does not itself impinge on a right or liberty protected by the Constitution, the validity of the classification must be sustained unless the classification rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of [any legitimate government] objective....[Jordan] may have been disqualified unwisely but he was not denied equal protection.\"<ref>http://www.aele.org/apa/jordan-newlondon.html</ref> The dismissal was upheld on appeal to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]].\n\n==Central tendency of Wonderlic scores==\n{{See also|Central tendency}}\nServing as a quantitative measure for employers, scores are collected by the employers and the applicant's score may be compared to a professional standard, as is the case with security guards or, simply, compared to the scores of other applicants who happen to be applying for the same or similar positions at that time.<ref name=Wonderlic1983>{{cite book|title=Wonderlic Personnel Test Manual|year=1983|publisher=E.F.
