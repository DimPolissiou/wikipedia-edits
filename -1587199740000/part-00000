Disney began distributing videos under its own label in 1980 under the name Walt Disney Home Entertainment.\n\n==Background==\nBefore Disney began releasing home video titles itself, it licensed some titles to [[DiscoVision|MCA Discovision]] for their newly developed disc format, later called [[LaserDisc]]. According to the Blam Entertainment Group website,<ref>{{cite web |last=Young\n |first=Blaine |title=MCA DiscoVision |publisher=Blam Entertainment Group |url=http://www.blamld.com/DiscoVision |accessdate=September 19, 2006 }}</ref> which has extensive details of DiscoVision releases, only six Disney titles were actually released on DiscoVision. One of these was the feature film ''[[Kidnapped (1960 film)|Kidnapped]]''. The others were compilations of Disney shorts. The first titles released in 1978 included: ''On Vacation with Mickey Mouse and Friends'' (#D61-503), ''Kids is Kids'' (#D61-504), ''At Home with Donald Duck'' (#D61-505), ''Adventures of Chip 'n' Dale'' (#D61-506), and finally ''The Coyote's Lament'' (#D61-507) which was released in May 1979. Disney's agreement with MCA ended in December 1981.<ref name=\"disneylaser\">{{cite journal |title=Disney Releases 10 Titles on Laser Videodisc |date=Summer 1982 |journal=Videodisc/videotex |volume=2 |issue=3 |page=175 |publisher=Meckler Publishing }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn 1980, Disney established its own video distribution operation as part of '''Walt Disney Telecommunications and Non-Theatrical Company''' (WDTNT) with Jim Jimirro as its first president.<ref>{{cite web |title=Oral History Collection \u2013 James P.

WDTNT also handled the marketing of other miscellaneous ancillary items such as short [[8 mm film]]s for home movies.\n\n[[File:Pete's Dragon front cover (1980 release).JPG|thumb|100px|The very first VHS release from Disney]]\nDisney's first releases on tape were 13 titles that were licensed for rental to [[Fotomat]] on March 4, 1980,<ref>{{cite news |title=Walt Disney \u2013 Fotomat Announce Video Tape Programming Pact |publisher=Dow Jones News Service \u2013 Ticker |date=March 3, 1980 }}</ref> initially in a four-city test (Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, and San Francisco/Oakland/San Jose), to be expanded nationwide by the end of 1980. The agreement specified rental fees ranging from $7.95 to $13.95. This first batch of titles on [[VHS]] and [[Betamax|Beta]] included 10 live action movies: ''[[Pete's Dragon (1977 film)|Pete's Dragon]]'' (#10), ''[[The Black Hole]]'' (#11), ''[[The Love Bug]]'' (#12), ''[[Escape to Witch Mountain (1975 film)|Escape to Witch Mountain]]'' (#13), ''[[Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier]]'' (#14), ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (#15), ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'' (#16), ''[[The North Avenue Irregulars]]'' (#17), ''[[The Apple Dumpling Gang (film)|The Apple Dumpling Gang]]'' (#18), and ''[[Hot Lead and Cold Feet]]'' (#19); and three of the compilations of short cartoons previously released by DiscoVision: ''On Vacation with Mickey Mouse and Friends'' (#20), ''Kids is Kids'' starring Donald Duck (#21), and ''Adventures of Chip 'n' Dale'' (#22). Later, on December 30, 1980, ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' (#23) was added to make 14 titles in all.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nNo new titles were released for half a year after ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', but Walt Disney Home Video announced an expanded program for \"Authorized Rental Dealers\" in December 1980, and began to expand its dealer network during the first part of 1981.<ref>\n{{cite news |title=Studios hamstrung as rentals of videocassettes trim profits |publisher=Wall Street Journal |date=March 27, 1981 }}</ref> From January 1 to March 31, 1981, Disney had a \"License One \u2014 Get One Free\" promotion to encourage dealers to sign up. They also offered free rental use of a 7-minute ''Mickey Mouse Disco'' videocassette for customers who rented any title from an Authorized Rental Dealer from February through May 1981.\n\nDisney was unusual among the major studios in offering a program for authorized rentals. Most of the other studios involved in the videocassette market at the time were trying to find ways to stop dealers from renting out their movie tapes. [[Magnetic Video]] (with titles from [[20th Century Fox]] and others) ceased doing business with Fotomat after Fotomat began renting Magnetic Video cassettes without authorization.<ref>{{cite news |title=Magnetic Video Decision Awaited: Firm's Cassette Rental Policy Expected in 3\u20134 Weeks |first=George |last=Kopp |publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=February 14, 1981 }}</ref> Disney's rental cassettes in blue cases looked completely different from sale cassettes, which were in white cases. That was designed to make it easy for Disney representatives to tell if dealers were violating their dealer agreements by renting out cassettes intended for sale, and it continued until 1984, when they stopped doing so.\n\nIn the late-1980s, Disney began seeking other outlets to distribute its video, and decided to ink deals with mass-merchant retailers such as [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[Caldor]], and [[Walmart]]. In 1989, Disney sought to further control the distribution of its products by eliminating the use of [[rack jobber]]s. Around this time, the studio began partnering with major retailers for advertising campaigns.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Work in Progress: Risking Failure, Surviving Success|last=Eisner|first=Michael|last2=Schwartz|first2=Tony|publisher=Random House|year=1998|isbn=0375500715|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/workinprogress00eisn/page/186 186-191]|oclc=39919327|author-link=Michael Eisner|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/workinprogress00eisn/page/186}}</ref>\n\n===Buena Vista Home Video===\nBuena Vista Home Video was incorporated on February 13, 1987.<ref name=sosca/> In April 1996, due to ongoing post Disney-CC/ABC merger realignment, Buena Vista Home Video was transferred out of the Disney Television and Telecommunications group to [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|The Walt Disney Studios]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Roth, Iger Assume Expanded Responsibilities at the Walt Disney Company|url= http://www.thefreelibrary.com/ROTH%2c+IGER+ASSUME+EXPANDED+RESPONSIBILITIES+AT+THE+WALT+DISNEY+COMPANY-a018198127 |accessdate=March 11, 2013 |newspaper=PRNewswire|date=April 16, 1996}}</ref> Buena Vista Home Video was renamed Buena Vista Home Entertainment in 1997.<ref name=dodny/>\n\n==Company structure==\nThe company currently distributes [[digital media]], [[Blu-ray|Blu-ray discs]] and [[DVD]]s under the following labels:\n*Disney (1978\u2013present, formerly Walt Disney Home Video (1980\u20132001) Walt Disney Home Entertainment (1978-1980, 2001\u20132007), and Disney Videos, internationally (1999\u20132005))\n*Buena Vista Home Entertainment (1984\u20132010, no longer used in the US as a label but remains in use in other countries; formerly Buena Vista Home Video)\n*[[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]] (2001\u2013present, formerly ABC Family)\n*[[ABC Studios]] (2007\u2013present, previously used the Buena Vista Home Entertainment label)\n*[[Marvel Studios]] (2012\u2013present)\n*[[Lucasfilm]] (2014\u2013present)\n*[[20th Century Studios Home Entertainment]], formerly 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment (2020\u2013present)\n\nThe company used to distribute under the following labels:\n*[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Video]] (1997\u20131999)\n*[[DIC Entertainment|DIC Toon-Time Video]] (1991\u20132000, US only)\n*[[Dimension Films|Dimension Home Video]] (1994\u20132005)\n*[[ESPN|ESPN Video]] (1990's)\n*[[Jim Henson Home Entertainment|Jim Henson Video]] (1993\u20131996)\n*[[Miramax|Miramax Home Entertainment]] (1994\u20132010)\n*Miramax/Dimension Home Entertainment (1995\u20132006)\n*Muppet Home Video (1983\u20131985, US only)\n*[[Touchstone Pictures|Touchstone Home Entertainment]] (1984\u20132017{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}, formerly Touchstone Home Video)\n*[[Hollywood Pictures|Hollywood Pictures Home Entertainment]] (1991\u20132007{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}, formerly Hollywood Pictures Home Video)\n\nThe company also licenses its live-action film catalog (mostly lesser known titles) from the Touchstone, Hollywood, ABC and Fox libraries to [[Kino Lorber]].

By 1982, all the video releases were for sale and rental, along with newer releases, but at high prices.\n\nTo market these new video releases, the company produced an exclusive promo seen after various Disney video films. The promo was nicknamed \"Walt Disney and You\" by fans for the customized tune in the promo. The promo also featured clips from the various releases and ended with a video-freeze of the then-current Walt Disney Home Video opening sequence (known as the \"Neon Mickey\"; a screenshot from this can be seen above). This promo was also used for other non-Disney labels such as Touchstone Home Video.\n\nOn July 16, 1985, it saw the home video premiere of ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' which became the bestselling video of that year.\n\nLater, the 1985 Making Your Dreams Come True Promotion started on November 6, 1985 with repackaged live action titles and ''[[Dumbo]]'' was released on the same day as well.\n\nDisney targeted produced the ''Walt Disney Video A Longs'' and ''Disney's Greatest Lullabies'' collection of videos for their children. The series hit stores in January 1986.\n\nDisney later produced the [[Disney Sing-Along Songs]] collection of videos for young children in association with Harry Arends and Phil Savenick. The series first hit stores on October 14, 1986.\n\n== Disney DVD==\n'''Disney DVD''' is the brand name under which Buena Vista Home Entertainment releases its Disney-branded motion pictures. Disney began working on title releases for [[DVD]]s in 1997, although they were not released in this format in the UK until 1999. Disney's first U.S. DVD release was [[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]] on March 20, 1998. [[VHS]] releases ceased with ''Bambi II'', which was released on February 7, 2006 (However, Disney continued to distribute new titles on VHS through the Disney Movie Club). The brand launched a loyalty program called Disney Movie Rewards in October 2006. Participants can collect points by submitting ticket stubs from Disney feature films, \"magic codes\" from Disney home video purchases and Disney CDs. The points can be redeemed for prizes like games, DVDs, books, posters, and collectibles.<ref>{{cite news|last1=K.

Originally, the line comprised the company's ten best-selling VHS titles and was released in October of each year. ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' was the first film to receive this honor in 2001. The two following titles, ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' and ''[[The Lion King]]'' were both released in [[IMAX]] and other giant screen theaters during the holiday season before their October [[DVD]] releases. Due to underperforming box office results, this tradition was terminated after ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]''. In May 2003, Disney announced that they would be adding the next four best-selling titles to the collection. Starting in 2005, a Platinum Editions was released in October and February/March. Another tradition practiced for these releases were gift sets, containing supplements such as original animation sketches, a film frame, and a companion's book.\n\nThe complete list of Platinum Editions includes: ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[The Lion King]]'', ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', ''[[Bambi]]'', ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'', ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'', ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'', ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians|101 Dalmatians]]'', ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'', and ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]''.\nThe original plan for the Platinum Editions was that they would be released ten years after they are put in the [[Disney Vault]]. Since then, this time has been shortened to four to seven years.\n\n===Diamond Editions===\nBeginning with ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' in October 2009, Disney began re-issuing Platinum Editions titles under a new Diamond Editions classification on Blu-ray + DVD Combo Pack seven years later.<ref>[http://www.ultimatedisney.com/diamondcollection-pressrelease-0910.html Disney's Blu-ray Diamond Collection - Press Release].

Some titles (mainly films from the [[Disney Renaissance]] era) also received 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray releases.\n\n==Disney Blu-ray==\n'''Disney Blu-ray''' is the brand name under which Buena Vista Home Entertainment releases its Disney-branded motion pictures in [[High-definition television|High-Definition]]. In late 2006, Disney began releasing titles, like the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (film series)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' films, the ''[[National Treasure (franchise)|National Treasure]]'' films, and the first two ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia (film series)|Narnia]]'' films on [[Blu-ray]].\n\n===Disney Blu-ray 3-D===\n{{main|Disney Digital 3D}}\nIn late 2010, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment began releasing their movies in the Blu-ray 3D format, starting with ''[[A Christmas Carol (2009 film)|A Christmas Carol]]'' and ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''. As of 2014 however, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released only specific movies on Blu-ray 3D in North America, including but not limited to Marvel movies, ''[[Toy Story]]'', ''[[Toy Story 2]]'', ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'', ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'', ''[[Toy Story 3]]'', ''[[Cars 2]]'', ''[[Brave (2012 film)|Brave]]'', ''[[Monsters University]]'', ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]'', ''[[The Good Dinosaur]]'', ''[[Zootopia]]'', ''[[Finding Dory]]'' and ''[[Moana (2016 film)|Moana]]''. In 2017, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment quietly discontinued releasing new titles in the format in North America, presumably due to the declining interest in the 3D format at home in the region. The last two titles released, ''[[Rogue One|Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]'' and ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'' were both released in limited quantities as retailer execlusives (with the former being only available at [[Target Corporation|Target]] and [[Best Buy]], and the latter only available at Best Buy).

Disney began distributing videos under its own label in 1980 under the name Walt Disney Home Entertainment.\n\n==Background==\nBefore Disney began releasing home video titles itself, it licensed some titles to [[DiscoVision|MCA Discovision]] for their newly developed disc format, later called [[LaserDisc]]. According to the Blam Entertainment Group website,<ref>{{cite web |last=Young\n |first=Blaine |title=MCA DiscoVision |publisher=Blam Entertainment Group |url=http://www.blamld.com/DiscoVision |accessdate=September 19, 2006 }}</ref> which has extensive details of DiscoVision releases, only six Disney titles were actually released on DiscoVision. One of these was the feature film ''[[Kidnapped (1960 film)|Kidnapped]]''. The others were compilations of Disney shorts. The first titles released in 1978 included: ''On Vacation with Mickey Mouse and Friends'' (#D61-503), ''Kids is Kids'' (#D61-504), ''At Home with Donald Duck'' (#D61-505), ''Adventures of Chip 'n' Dale'' (#D61-506), and finally ''The Coyote's Lament'' (#D61-507) which was released in May 1979. Disney's agreement with MCA ended in December 1981.<ref name=\"disneylaser\">{{cite journal |title=Disney Releases 10 Titles on Laser Videodisc |date=Summer 1982 |journal=Videodisc/videotex |volume=2 |issue=3 |page=175 |publisher=Meckler Publishing }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn 1980, Disney established its own video distribution operation as part of '''Walt Disney Telecommunications and Non-Theatrical Company''' (WDTNT) with Jim Jimirro as its first president.<ref>{{cite web |title=Oral History Collection \u2013 James P.

WDTNT also handled the marketing of other miscellaneous ancillary items such as short [[8 mm film]]s for home movies.\n\n[[File:Pete's Dragon front cover (1980 release).JPG|thumb|100px|The very first VHS release from Disney]]\nDisney's first releases on tape were 13 titles that were licensed for rental to [[Fotomat]] on March 4, 1980,<ref>{{cite news |title=Walt Disney \u2013 Fotomat Announce Video Tape Programming Pact |publisher=Dow Jones News Service \u2013 Ticker |date=March 3, 1980 }}</ref> initially in a four-city test (Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, and San Francisco/Oakland/San Jose), to be expanded nationwide by the end of 1980.

Later, on December 30, 1980, ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' (#23) was added to make 14 titles in all.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nNo new titles were released for half a year after ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', but Walt Disney Home Video announced an expanded program for \"Authorized Rental Dealers\" in December 1980, and began to expand its dealer network during the first part of 1981.<ref>\n{{cite news |title=Studios hamstrung as rentals of videocassettes trim profits |publisher=Wall Street Journal |date=March 27, 1981 }}</ref> From January 1 to March 31, 1981, Disney had a \"License One \u2014 Get One Free\" promotion to encourage dealers to sign up. They also offered free rental use of a 7-minute ''Mickey Mouse Disco'' videocassette for customers who rented any title from an Authorized Rental Dealer from February through May 1981.\n\nDisney was unusual among the major studios in offering a program for authorized rentals. Most of the other studios involved in the videocassette market at the time were trying to find ways to stop dealers from renting out their movie tapes. [[Magnetic Video]] (with titles from [[20th Century Fox]] and others) ceased doing business with Fotomat after Fotomat began renting Magnetic Video cassettes without authorization.<ref>{{cite news |title=Magnetic Video Decision Awaited: Firm's Cassette Rental Policy Expected in 3\u20134 Weeks |first=George |last=Kopp |publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=February 14, 1981 }}</ref> Disney's rental cassettes in blue cases looked completely different from sale cassettes, which were in white cases. That was designed to make it easy for Disney representatives to tell if dealers were violating their dealer agreements by renting out cassettes intended for sale, and it continued until 1984, when they stopped doing so.\n\nIn the late-1980s, Disney began seeking other outlets to distribute its video, and decided to ink deals with mass-merchant retailers such as [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[Caldor]], and [[Walmart]]. In 1989, Disney sought to further control the distribution of its products by eliminating the use of [[rack jobber]]s.

The two following titles, ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' and ''[[The Lion King]]'' were both released in [[IMAX]] and other giant screen theaters during the holiday season before their October [[DVD]] releases. Due to underperforming box office results, this tradition was terminated after ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]''. In May 2003, Disney announced that they would be adding the next four best-selling titles to the collection. Starting in 2005, a Platinum Editions was released in October and February/March.

As of 2014 however, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released only specific movies on Blu-ray 3D in North America, including but not limited to Marvel movies, ''[[Toy Story]]'', ''[[Toy Story 2]]'', ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'', ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'', ''[[Toy Story 3]]'', ''[[Cars 2]]'', ''[[Brave (2012 film)|Brave]]'', ''[[Monsters University]]'', ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]'', ''[[The Good Dinosaur]]'', ''[[Zootopia]]'', ''[[Finding Dory]]'' and ''[[Moana (2016 film)|Moana]]''. In 2017, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment quietly discontinued releasing new titles in the format in North America, presumably due to the declining interest in the 3D format at home in the region. The last two titles released, ''[[Rogue One|Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]'' and ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'' were both released in limited quantities as retailer execlusives (with the former being only available at [[Target Corporation|Target]] and [[Best Buy]], and the latter only available at Best Buy). Despite this, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment has continued releasing new titles in the format in other regions.\n\n===Disney Second Screen===\n{{main|Disney Second Screen}}\nA new feature that

[[Jordan]] and the [[Golan Heights]] border the river to the east, while the [[West Bank]] and [[Israel]] lie to its west. Both Jordan and the West Bank take their names from the river.\n\nThe river holds major significance in [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]] since the [[Bible]] says that the Israelites crossed it into the [[Promised Land]] and that [[Jesus of Nazareth]] [[Baptism of Jesus|was baptized]] by [[John the Baptist]] in it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interfaithsustain.com/an-interfaith-look-at-the-jordan-river/|title=An Interfaith Look at the Jordan River|accessdate=16 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418195919/http://www.interfaithsustain.com/an-interfaith-look-at-the-jordan-river/|archive-date=18 April 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe Jordan River has an upper course from its sources to the Sea of Galilee, and a lower course south of the Sea of Galilee down to the Dead Sea. In traditional terminology, the upper course (or most of it) is commonly referred to as passing through the \"[[Hula Valley]]\", as opposed to \"Upper Jordan Valley\"; the Sea of Galilee through which the river passes is a separate entity; and the term [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]] is reserved for the lower course, fed by the Yarmouk and Zarqa Rivers.\n\nOver its upper course (fed by the Hasbani River, Banias River, Dan River, and the Iyyon Stream), the river drops rapidly in a {{convert|75|km|adj=on}} run to the once large and swampy [[Hula Valley|Lake Hula]], which is slightly above [[sea level]]. Exiting the now much-diminished lake, it goes through an even steeper drop over the {{convert|25|km}} down to the Sea of Galilee, which it enters at its northern end. The Jordan deposits much of the silt it is carrying within the lake, which it leaves again near its southern tip at [[Degania Dam]]. At that point, the river is situated about 210 metres below sea level. The last {{convert|120|km|adj=on}}-long section follows what is commonly termed the \"Jordan Valley\", which has less [[stream gradient|gradient]] (the total drop is another 210 metres) so that the river [[meander]]s before entering the [[Dead Sea]], a [[Endorheic basin|terminal lake]] about 422 metres below sea level with no outlet. Two major [[Tributary|tributaries]] enter from the east during this last section: the [[Yarmouk River]] and [[Zarqa River]].\n\nIts section north of the Sea of Galilee is within the boundaries of Israel and forms the western boundary of the [[Golan Heights]]. South of the lake, it forms the border between the Kingdom of Jordan (to the east), and Israel (to the west).\n\n===Tributaries===\n[[File:The Jordan River loops, aerial view 1938.jpg|thumb|Aerial view, 1938]]\n\nThe streams coming together to create the River Jordan in its upper basin are, west to east:\n* [[Nahal Ayun|Iyyon]] (Hebrew: \u05e2\u05d9\u05d5\u05df ''Iyyon''), Arabic name: \u062f\u0631\u062f\u0631\u0647 ''Dardara'' for the uppermost course and \u0628\u0631\u0627\u063a\u064a\u062b ''Bareighith'' for the rest of its course, a stream which flows from [[Marjeyoun District|Merj 'Ayun area]] in southern Lebanon.\n* [[Hasbani River|Hasbani]] (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u0635\u0628\u0627\u0646\u064a ''Hasbani'', Hebrew: either \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05e8 ''Snir'' or ''Hatzbani''), a stream which flows from the north-western foot of Mount Hermon in Lebanon.<ref>{{Cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=rhAzDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT260 |title= Essays in Political Geography |last= |first= |publisher= Routledge |year= 2016 |isbn= 9781317605287 |page=260 |access-date=2019-01-17 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200102035947/https://books.google.com/books?id=rhAzDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT260 |archive-date= 2020-01-02 |url-status= live}}</ref>\n* [[Dan River (Middle East)|Dan]] (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0646 ''Leddan'', Hebrew: \u05d3\u05df ''Dan''), a stream whose source is also at the base of Mount Hermon.\n* [[Nahal Hermon|Banias]] (Arabic: \u0628\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0627\u0633 ''Banias'', Hebrew: either ''Banias'' or \u05d7\u05e8\u05de\u05d5\u05df ''Hermon''), a stream arising from a spring at [[Banias]] at the foot of [[Mount Hermon]].\nSouth of the [[Sea of Galilee]] the Jordan River receives the waters of further tributaries, the main ones being\n* [[Yarmouk River|Yarmouk]], which forms the border between Syria and Jordan and then Jordan and Israel<ref name=Gafni>[https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Map-of-the-Lower-Jordan-River-survey-sites-and-reference-sites-Site-1-Gesher-Jisr-Al_fig2_281289496 Map of the Lower Jordan River], from Sarig Gafny, Samer Talozi, Banan Al Sheikh, Elizabeth Ya\u2019ari, ''Towards a Living Jordan River: An Environmental Flows Report on the Rehabilitation of the Lower Jordan River'', EcoPeace/ Friends of the Earth Middle East (FoEME), May 2010, retrieved 14 April 2020</ref>\n* [[Zarqa River|Zarqa]] coming from the east (Jordan)<ref name=Gafni/>\nSmaller tributaries in this segment are, north to south<br>\n- from the east\n* Wadi al-'Arab<ref name=Gafni/>\n* Wadi Ziqlab<ref name=Gafni/>\n* [[Chorath|Wadi al-Yabis]]<ref name=Gafni/>\n* [[Wadi Kafranja]]<ref name=Gafni/> or Kufrinjah passing near [[Ajloun]]\n* Wadi Rajib, the last before Wadi Zarqa<ref name=Gafni/>\n* - Wadi Nimrin<ref name=Gafni/><br>\n- from the west\n* Nahal Yavne'el<ref name=Gafni/>\n* Nahal Tavor (Tabor Stream)<ref name=Gafni/>\n* Nahal Yissakhar<ref name=Gafni/>\n** Nahal Harod<ref name=Gafni/>\n* Nahal Bezeq, on the border between Israel and the West Bank, between [[Mount Gilboa]] and the [[Samaria]] Mountains<ref name=Gafni/>\n* Wadi Malih/Milkha from the Samaria Mountains<ref name=Gafni/>\n* [[Wadi al-Far'a (river)|Wadi al-Far'a]] coming from the [[Nablus]] area<ref name=Gafni/>\n* Wadi Ouja<ref name=Gafni/>\n* [[Wadi Qelt]] coming down from the [[Judean mountains]] and passing through [[Jericho]]<ref name=Gafni/>\n\n==Etymology==\nWhile several hypotheses for the origin of the river's name have been proposed, the most accepted is that it comes from Semitic Yard|on 'flow down' <\u221a\u05d9\u05e8\u05d3 reflecting the river's declivity.<ref name=\"rahkonen\">{{cite journal |last1=Rahkonen |first1=Pauli Ensio Juhani |title=\"Canaanites\" or \"Amorites\"?

There is no regular description of the Jordan in the Bible; only scattered and indefinite references to it are given. [[Jacob]] crossed it and its tributary, the [[Jabbok]] (the modern Al-Zarqa), on his way back from [[Haran]] ({{bibleverse||Genesis|32:11|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|32:23\u201324|HE}}). It is noted as the line of demarcation between the \"two tribes and the half tribe\" settled to the [[Transjordan (Bible)|east]] ([[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] {{bibleverse-nb||Numbers|34:15|HE}}) and the \"nine tribes and the half tribe of Manasseh\" that, led by [[Joshua]], settled to the west ({{bibleverse||Joshua|13:7|HE}}, passim). \n\nOpposite [[Jericho]], it was called \"the Jordan of Jericho\" ({{bibleverse||Numbers|34:15|HE}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Numbers|35:1|HE}}). The Jordan has a number of [[ford (crossing)|fords]], and one of them is famous as the place where many Ephraimites were slain by Jephthah ([[Book of Judges|Judges]] {{bibleverse-nb||Judges|12:5\u20136|HE}}). It seems that these are the same fords mentioned as being near Beth-barah, where Gideon lay in wait for the [[Midian]]ites ({{bibleverse||Judges|7:24|HE}}). In the plain of the Jordan, between [[Sukkot|Succoth]] and [[Zarthan]], is the clay ground where Solomon had his brass-foundries ([[Books of Kings|1 Kings]] {{bibleverse-nb|1|Kings|7:46|HE}}). In {{bibleverse|2|Kings|6:1-4|HE}} the Jordan valley is portrayed as a woodland region. Biblical commentator [[Albert Barnes (theologian)|Albert Barnes]] suggested that \"trees were rare in most parts of Palestine, but plentiful in the Jordan Valley\".<ref>[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/6.htm Barnes' Notes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106204816/http://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/6.htm |date=2018-01-06 }} on 2 Kings 6, accessed 26 December 2017</ref>\n\nIn biblical history, the Jordan appears as the scene of several [[miracle]]s, the first taking place when the Jordan, near Jericho, was crossed by the Israelites under Joshua ({{bibleverse||Joshua|3:15\u201317|HE}}). Later the two tribes and the half tribe that settled east of the Jordan built a large altar on its banks as \"a witness\" between them and the other tribes ({{bibleverse||Joshua|22:10|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|22:26|HE}}, et seq.). The Jordan was crossed by [[Elijah]] and [[Elisha]] on dry ground ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|2:8|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb|2|Kings|2:14|HE}}). The prophet and wonder-worker Elisha performed two miracles at the Jordan: he healed [[Naaman]]'s [[leprosy]] by having him bathe in its waters ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|5:14|HE}}), and he made an axe head lost by one of the \"children of the prophets\" float, by throwing a piece of wood into the water ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|6:6|HE}}).\n\n[[Yom HaAliyah]] (Aliyah Day, {{lang-he|\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d4\u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d9\u05d4}}) is an [[Israel]]i national holiday celebrated annually on the tenth of the [[Hebrew]] month of [[Nisan]] to commemorate the Israelites crossing the Jordan River into the Land of Israel while carrying the [[Ark of the Covenant]] as recorded in the Hebrew Bible\u2019s Book of Joshua.\n\n===New Testament===\n[[File:Jordanian Christian women visiting Al-Maghtas, Jordan River, 1913 (cropped) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Jordanian Christian women on pilgrimage to [[Al-Maghtas]], 28 November 1913.]]\nThe [[New Testament]] states that [[John the Baptist]] baptised unto repentance<ref>Cf. {{bibleverse||Acts|19:4|KJV}}</ref> in the Jordan ([[Matthew 3:5]]\u2013[[Matthew 3:6|6]]; [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]]{{bibleverse-nb||Mark|1:5|KJV}}; [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|3:3|KJV}}; [[Gospel of John|John]]{{bibleverse-nb||John|1:28|KJV}}). These acts of [[Baptism]] are also reported as having taken place at [[Bethabara]] ({{bibleverse||John|1:28|KJV}}).\n\n[[File:Bethany (5).JPG|250px|right|thumb| [[Al-Maghtas]] ruins on the Jordanian side of the Jordan River are the putative location for the Baptism of [[Jesus]] and the ministry of [[John the Baptist]]]]\n\n[[Jesus]] came [[Baptism of Jesus|to be baptised]] by him there ([[Matthew 3:13]]; {{bibleverse||Mark|1:9|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Luke|3:21|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|4:1|KJV}}). The Jordan is also where John the Baptist bore record of Jesus as the [[Son of God]] and [[Lamb of God]] ({{bibleverse||John|1:29\u201336|KJV}}).\n\nThe [[prophecy]] of [[Isaiah]] regarding the [[Messiah]] which names the Jordan ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|9:1\u20132|KJV}}) is also reported in {{bibleverse||Matthew|4:15|KJV}}.\n\nThe New Testament speaks several times about Jesus crossing the Jordan during his ministry ({{bibleverse||Matthew|19:1|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Mark|10:1|KJV}}), and of believers crossing the Jordan to come hear him [[Sermon|preach]] and to be [[miracle|healed]] of their diseases ({{bibleverse||Matthew|4:25|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Mark|3:7\u20138|KJV}}). When his enemies sought to capture him, Jesus took refuge at the river in the place John had first baptised ({{bibleverse||John|10:39\u201340|KJV}}).\n\nScholars have concluded that the site called [[Al-Maghtas]] on the east side has long been considered the location for the Baptism of Jesus and a place of pilgrimage though most current pilgrims go to a location on the west side, [[Qasr el Yahud]], also long'established but not as early. This has led to choosing Al-Maghtas as a UNESCO World Heritage site, which took place in 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1446 |title= Baptism Site \"Bethany Beyond the Jordan\" (Al-Maghtas) |author= UNESCO World Heritage Centre |access-date= 16 January 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170119092144/http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1446 |archive-date= 19 January 2017 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\n===Derived cultural significance===\n====Symbolism====\nBecause, according to Jewish tradition, the [[Israelites]] made a difficult and hazardous journey from [[slavery]] in [[Egypt]] to freedom in [[Promised Land|the Promised Land]], the Jordan can refer to freedom.

[[Jordan]] and the [[Golan Heights]] border the river to the east, while the [[West Bank]] and [[Israel]] lie to its west. Both Jordan and the West Bank take their names from the river.\n\nThe river holds major significance in [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]] since the [[Bible]] says that the Israelites crossed it into the [[Promised Land]] and that [[Jesus of Nazareth]] [[Baptism of Jesus|was baptized]] by [[John the Baptist]] in it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interfaithsustain.com/an-interfaith-look-at-the-jordan-river/|title=An Interfaith Look at the Jordan River|accessdate=16 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418195919/http://www.interfaithsustain.com/an-interfaith-look-at-the-jordan-river/|archive-date=18 April 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe Jordan River has an upper course from its sources to the Sea of Galilee, and a lower course south of the Sea of Galilee down to the Dead Sea. In traditional terminology, the upper course (or most of it) is commonly referred to as passing through the \"[[Hula Valley]]\", as opposed to \"Upper Jordan Valley\"; the Sea of Galilee through which the river passes is a separate entity; and the term [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]] is reserved for the lower course, fed by the Yarmouk and Zarqa Rivers.\n\nOver its upper course (fed by the Hasbani River, Banias River, Dan River, and the Iyyon Stream), the river drops rapidly in a {{convert|75|km|adj=on}} run to the once large and swampy [[Hula Valley|Lake Hula]], which is slightly above [[sea level]]. Exiting the now much-diminished lake, it goes through an even steeper drop over the {{convert|25|km}} down to the Sea of Galilee, which it enters at its northern end. The Jordan deposits much of the silt it is carrying within the lake, which it leaves again near its southern tip at [[Degania Dam]]. At that point, the river is situated about 210 metres below sea level. The last {{convert|120|km|adj=on}}-long section follows what is commonly termed the \"Jordan Valley\", which has less [[stream gradient|gradient]] (the total drop is another 210 metres) so that the river [[meander]]s before entering the [[Dead Sea]], a [[Endorheic basin|terminal lake]] about 422 metres below sea level with no outlet. Two major [[Tributary|tributaries]] enter from the east during this last section: the [[Yarmouk River]] and [[Zarqa River]].\n\nIts section north of the Sea of Galilee is within the boundaries of Israel and forms the western boundary of the [[Golan Heights]]. South of the lake, it forms the border between the Kingdom of Jordan (to the east), and Israel (to the west).\n\n===Tributaries===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\n[[File:The Jordan River loops, aerial view 1938.jpg|thumb|Aerial view, 1938]]\nThe streams coming together to create the River Jordan in its upper basin are, west to east:\n* [[Nahal Ayun|Iyyon]] (Hebrew: \u05e2\u05d9\u05d5\u05df ''Iyyon''), Arabic name: \u062f\u0631\u062f\u0631\u0647 ''Dardara'' for the uppermost course and \u0628\u0631\u0627\u063a\u064a\u062b ''Bareighith'' for the rest of its course, a stream which flows from [[Marjeyoun District|Merj 'Ayun area]] in southern Lebanon.\n* [[Hasbani River|Hasbani]] (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u0635\u0628\u0627\u0646\u064a ''Hasbani'', Hebrew: either \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05e8 ''Snir'' or ''Hatzbani''), a stream which flows from the north-western foot of Mount Hermon in Lebanon.<ref>{{Cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=rhAzDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT260 |title= Essays in Political Geography |last= |first= |publisher= Routledge |year= 2016 |isbn= 9781317605287 |page=260 |access-date=2019-01-17 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200102035947/https://books.google.com/books?id=rhAzDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT260 |archive-date= 2020-01-02 |url-status= live}}</ref>\n* [[Dan River (Middle East)|Dan]] (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0646 ''Leddan'', Hebrew: \u05d3\u05df ''Dan''), a stream whose source is also at the base of Mount Hermon.\n* [[Nahal Hermon|Banias]] (Arabic: \u0628\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0627\u0633 ''Banias'', Hebrew: either ''Banias'' or \u05d7\u05e8\u05de\u05d5\u05df ''Hermon''), a stream arising from a spring at [[Banias]] at the foot of [[Mount Hermon]].\nSouth of the [[Sea of Galilee]] the Jordan River receives the waters of further tributaries, the main ones being\n* [[Yarmouk River|Yarmouk]], which forms the border between Syria and Jordan and then Jordan and Israel<ref name=Gafni>[https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Map-of-the-Lower-Jordan-River-survey-sites-and-reference-sites-Site-1-Gesher-Jisr-Al_fig2_281289496 Map of the Lower Jordan River], from Sarig Gafny, Samer Talozi, Banan Al Sheikh, Elizabeth Ya\u2019ari, ''Towards a Living Jordan River: An Environmental Flows Report on the Rehabilitation of the Lower Jordan River'', EcoPeace/ Friends of the Earth Middle East (FoEME), May 2010, retrieved 14 April 2020</ref>\n* [[Zarqa River|Zarqa]] coming from the east (Jordan)<ref name=Gafni/>\nSmaller tributaries in this segment are, north to south<br>\n- from the east\n* Wadi al-'Arab<ref name=Gafni/>\n* Wadi Ziqlab<ref name=Gafni/>\n* [[Chorath|Wadi al-Yabis]]<ref name=Gafni/>\n* [[Wadi Kafranja]]<ref name=Gafni/> or Kufrinjah passing near [[Ajloun]]\n* Wadi Rajib, the last before Wadi Zarqa<ref name=Gafni/>\n* - Wadi Nimrin<ref name=Gafni/><br>\n- from the west\n* Nahal Yavne'el<ref name=Gafni/>\n* Nahal Tavor (Tabor Stream)<ref name=Gafni/>\n* Nahal Yissakhar<ref name=Gafni/>\n** Nahal Harod\n* Nahal Bezeq, on the border between Israel and the West Bank, between [[Mount Gilboa]] and the [[Samaria]] Mountains<ref name=Gafni/>\n* Wadi Malih/Milkha from the Samaria Mountains<ref name=Gafni/>\n* [[Wadi al-Far'a (river)|Wadi al-Far'a]] coming from the [[Nablus]] area<ref name=Gafni/>\n* Wadi Ouja<ref name=Gafni/>\n* [[Wadi Qelt]] coming down from the [[Judean mountains]] and passing through [[Jericho]]<ref name=Gafni/>\n\n==Etymology==\nWhile several hypotheses for the origin of the river's name have been proposed, the most accepted is that it comes from Semitic Yard|on 'flow down' <\u221a\u05d9\u05e8\u05d3 reflecting the river's declivity.<ref name=\"rahkonen\">{{cite journal |last1=Rahkonen |first1=Pauli Ensio Juhani |title=\"Canaanites\" or \"Amorites\"?

A 2010 study found that the Lower Jordan River has been reduced to 2% of its historic flow.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gafny |first1=Sarig |last2=Talozi |first2=Samer |last3=Al Sheikh |first3=Banan |last4=Ya\u2019ari |first4=Elizabeth |title=An Environmental Flows Report on the Rehabilitation of the Lower Jordan River |url=http://ecopeaceme.org/uploads/publications_publ117_1.pdf |website=ecopeaceme.org |access-date=2018-12-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181220230732/http://ecopeaceme.org/uploads/publications_publ117_1.pdf |archive-date=2018-12-20 |url-status=live }}</ref> Water quality has also deteriorated sharply, with high levels of salinity and pollution from agricultural fertilizer and untreated wastewater upstream in Israel and the West Bank.<ref>{{cite web|title=Surface and Groundwater of Jordan|url=https://water.fanack.com/jordan/water-resources/surface-and-groundwater/|website=Fanack Water|publisher=Fanack Water of the Middle East and North Africa|access-date=2018-03-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180311210155/https://water.fanack.com/jordan/water-resources/surface-and-groundwater/|archive-date=2018-03-11|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nConflict about the waters of the Jordan River was a contributing factor to the [[Origins of the Six-Day War#Water dispute|Six-Day War]] when, starting in 1965, [[Syria]] attempted to divert some of its headwaters in collaboration with Lebanon and Jordan.<ref name=mehr>Mehr, Farhang, \"The politics of water,\" in Antonino Zichichi, Richard C.

There is no regular description of the Jordan in the Bible; only scattered and indefinite references to it are given. [[Jacob]] crossed it and its tributary, the [[Jabbok]] (the modern Al-Zarqa), on his way back from [[Haran]] ({{bibleverse||Genesis|32:11|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|32:23\u201324|HE}}). It is noted as the line of demarcation between the \"two tribes and the half tribe\" settled to the [[Transjordan (Bible)|east]] ([[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] {{bibleverse-nb||Numbers|34:15|HE}}) and the \"nine tribes and the half tribe of Manasseh\" that, led by [[Joshua]], settled to the west ({{bibleverse||Joshua|13:7|HE}}, passim). \n\nOpposite [[Jericho]], it was called \"the Jordan of Jericho\" ({{bibleverse||Numbers|34:15|HE}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Numbers|35:1|HE}}). The Jordan has a number of [[ford (crossing)|fords]], and one of them is famous as the place where many Ephraimites were slain by Jephthah ([[Book of Judges|Judges]] {{bibleverse-nb||Judges|12:5\u20136|HE}}). It seems that these are the same fords mentioned as being near Beth-barah, where Gideon lay in wait for the [[Midian]]ites ({{bibleverse||Judges|7:24|HE}}). In the plain of the Jordan, between [[Sukkot|Succoth]] and [[Zarthan]], is the clay ground where Solomon had his brass-foundries ([[Books of Kings|1 Kings]] {{bibleverse-nb|1|Kings|7:46|HE}}). In {{bibleverse|2|Kings|6:1-4|HE}} the Jordan valley is portrayed as a woodland region. Biblical commentator [[Albert Barnes (theologian)|Albert Barnes]] suggested that \"trees were rare in most parts of Palestine, but plentiful in the Jordan Valley\".<ref>[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/6.htm Barnes' Notes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106204816/http://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/6.htm |date=2018-01-06 }} on 2 Kings 6, accessed 26 December 2017</ref>\n\nIn biblical history, the Jordan appears as the scene of several [[miracle]]s, the first taking place when the Jordan, near Jericho, was crossed by the Israelites under Joshua ({{bibleverse||Joshua|3:15\u201317|HE}}). Later the two tribes and the half tribe that settled east of the Jordan built a large altar on its banks as \"a witness\" between them and the other tribes ({{bibleverse||Joshua|22:10|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|22:26|HE}}, et seq.). The Jordan was crossed by [[Elijah]] and [[Elisha]] on dry ground ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|2:8|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb|2|Kings|2:14|HE}}). The prophet and wonder-worker Elisha performed two miracles at the Jordan: he healed [[Naaman]]'s [[leprosy]] by having him bathe in its waters ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|5:14|HE}}), and he made an axe head lost by one of the \"children of the prophets\" float, by throwing a piece of wood into the water ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|6:6|HE}}).\n\n[[Yom HaAliyah]] (Aliyah Day, {{lang-he|\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d4\u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d9\u05d4}}) is an [[Israel]]i national holiday celebrated annually on the tenth of the [[Hebrew]] month of [[Nisan]] to commemorate the Israelites crossing the Jordan River into the Land of Israel while carrying the [[Ark of the Covenant]] as recorded in the Hebrew Bible\u2019s Book of Joshua.\n\n===New Testament===\n[[File:Jordanian Christian women visiting Al-Maghtas, Jordan River, 1913 (cropped) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Jordanian Christian women on pilgrimage to [[Al-Maghtas]], 28 November 1913.]]\nThe [[New Testament]] states that [[John the Baptist]] baptised unto repentance<ref>Cf. {{bibleverse||Acts|19:4|KJV}}</ref> in the Jordan ([[Matthew 3:5]]\u2013[[Matthew 3:6|6]]; [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]]{{bibleverse-nb||Mark|1:5|KJV}}; [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|3:3|KJV}}; [[Gospel of John|John]]{{bibleverse-nb||John|1:28|KJV}}). These acts of [[Baptism]] are also reported as having taken place at [[Bethabara]] ({{bibleverse||John|1:28|KJV}}).\n\n[[File:Bethany (5).JPG|250px|right|thumb| [[Al-Maghtas]] ruins on the Jordanian side of the Jordan River are the putative location for the Baptism of [[Jesus]] and the ministry of [[John the Baptist]]]]\n\n[[Jesus]] came [[Baptism of Jesus|to be baptised]] by him there ([[Matthew 3:13]]; {{bibleverse||Mark|1:9|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Luke|3:21|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|4:1|KJV}}). The Jordan is also where John the Baptist bore record of Jesus as the [[Son of God]] and [[Lamb of God]] ({{bibleverse||John|1:29\u201336|KJV}}).\n\nThe [[prophecy]] of [[Isaiah]] regarding the [[Messiah]] which names the Jordan ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|9:1\u20132|KJV}}) is also reported in {{bibleverse||Matthew|4:15|KJV}}.\n\nThe New Testament speaks several times about Jesus crossing the Jordan during his ministry ({{bibleverse||Matthew|19:1|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Mark|10:1|KJV}}), and of believers crossing the Jordan to come hear him [[Sermon|preach]] and to be [[miracle|healed]] of their diseases ({{bibleverse||Matthew|4:25|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Mark|3:7\u20138|KJV}}). When his enemies sought to capture him, Jesus took refuge at the river in the place John had first baptised ({{bibleverse||John|10:39\u201340|KJV}}).\n\nScholars have concluded that the site called [[Al-Maghtas]] on the east side has long been considered the location for the Baptism of Jesus and a place of pilgrimage though most current pilgrims go to a location on the west side, [[Qasr el Yahud]], also long'established but not as early. This has led to choosing Al-Maghtas as a UNESCO World Heritage site, which took place in 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1446 |title= Baptism Site \"Bethany Beyond the Jordan\" (Al-Maghtas) |author= UNESCO World Heritage Centre |access-date= 16 January 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170119092144/http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1446 |archive-date= 19 January 2017 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\n===Derived cultural significance===\n====Symbolism====\nBecause, according to Jewish tradition, the [[Israelites]] made a difficult and hazardous journey from [[slavery]] in [[Egypt]] to freedom in [[Promised Land|the Promised Land]], the Jordan can refer to freedom.
