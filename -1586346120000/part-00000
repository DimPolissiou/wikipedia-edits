republic]].\n\nThe People's Republic of Bulgaria existed from 1946 to 1990 and it was ruled by the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]] (BCP), which in turn ruled together with its coalition partner, the [[Bulgarian Agrarian People's Union]] (former communist ally). Bulgaria was part of [[Comecon]] and a member of the [[Warsaw Pact]] and was closely allied with the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Cold War]]. The [[Bulgarian resistance movement during World War II]] deposed the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] administration in the [[Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat of 1944]] which ended the country's alliance with the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]] and led to the People's Republic in 1946.\n\nThe BCP modelled its policies after those of the Soviet Union, transforming the country over the course of a decade from an [[Agrarian society|agrarian]] [[peasant society]] into an [[industrialized]] [[Communist state|socialist society]]. In the mid-1950s and after the death of [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], conservative hardliners lost influence and a period of social [[liberalization]] and stability followed under [[Todor Zhivkov]]. Varying degrees of conservative or liberal influence followed. After a new energy and transportation infrastructure was constructed, by 1960 manufacturing became the dominant sector of the economy and Bulgaria became a major exporter of household goods and later on computer technologies, earning it the nickname of \"[[Silicon Valley]] of the [[Eastern Bloc]]\". The country's relatively high productivity levels and high scores on social development rankings made it a model for other [[socialist countries]]' administrative policies.\n\nIn 1989, after a few years of liberal influence, political reforms were initiated and [[Todor Zhivkov]], who had served as head of the party since 1954, was removed from office in a BCP congress. In 1990, under the leadership of [[Georgi Parvanov]], the BCP changed its name to the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]] (BSP) and adopted a [[centre-left]] political ideology in place of [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]]. Following the BSP victory in the [[1990 Bulgarian Constitutional Assembly election|1990 election]], which was the first openly contested [[multi-party system|multi-party]] election since [[1931 Bulgarian parliamentary election|1931]], the name of the state was changed to the [[Republic of Bulgaria]]. Geographically, the People's Republic of Bulgaria had the same borders as present-day Bulgaria and it bordered the [[Black Sea]] to the east; [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] to the north; [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] (via [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]) to the west and [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] to the south.\n\n==History==\n{{main|Bulgaria in World War II}}\nOn 1 March 1941, the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] signed the [[Tripartite Pact]], and officially became a member of [[Axis Powers|the Axis]]. Following the German invasion of Yugoslavia and Greece in April, Bulgaria came to occupy large parts of those countries. In 1942, the [[Fatherland Front (Bulgaria)|Fatherland Front]] was formed from a mixture of Communists, [[Socialists]] and [[Liberalism|Liberals]].\n\nThe highest estimate for the number of [[Bulgarian resistance movement during World War II|partisans]] at any one time in Bulgaria is 18,000.<ref>{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=8_zeaeTOz6YC}}|title=Who are the Macedonians?|last=Poulton|first=Hugh|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|year=2000|isbn=978-0-253-21359-4}}</ref>\n\n===Communist coup===\nIn 1944, with the [[Jassy\u2013Kishinev Offensive|entry]] of the [[Red Army]] into Romania, the Kingdom of Bulgaria renounced the Axis and declared neutrality. On 5 September, the Soviet Union declared war on the kingdom and three days later the Red Army entered north-eastern Bulgaria, prompting the government to declare support in order to minimise military conflict. On 9 September, communist partisans launched a [[Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat of 1944|coup d'\u00e9tat]] which ''de facto'' ended the rule of the [[Bulgarian monarchy]] and its administration, after which a new government assumed power led by the Fatherland Front (FF), which itself was led by the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]].\n\n===Early years and Chervenkov era===\n[[File:Georgi Dimitrov.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Georgi Dimitrov, leader of the Bulgarian Communist Party from 1946\u20131949]]\nAfter taking power, the FF formed a coalition led by former Primate Minister [[Kimon Georgiev]], which included the Social Democrats and the Agrarians. Under the terms of the peace settlement, Bulgaria was allowed to keep [[Southern Dobruja]], but formally renounced all claims to Greek and Yugoslav territory. 150,000 Bulgarians settled during the occupation were expelled from [[Western Thrace]]. The Communists deliberately took a minor role in the new government at first, while the Soviet representatives held the real power. A Communist-controlled People's Militia was set up, which harassed and intimidated non-Communist parties.\n\nOn 1 February 1945, [[Regent]] [[Prince Kiril of Bulgaria|Prince Kiril]], former Prime Minister [[Bogdan Filov]], and hundreds of other officials of the kingdom were arrested on charges of war crimes. By June, Kirill and the other Regents, twenty-two former ministers, and many others had been executed. The new government began to arrest Nazi collaborators. Thousands of people were charged with treason or participating in counter-revolutionary conspiracy and sentenced to either death or life in prison.<ref name=\"Hanna Arendt Centre\">Hanna Arendt Centre in Sofia, with Dinyu Sharlanov and Venelin I.

This strengthened when it became apparent that the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] had little interest in Bulgaria. In November 1945, Communist Party leader [[Georgi Dimitrov]] returned to Bulgaria after 22 years in exile. He made a truculent speech that rejected cooperation with opposition groups. [[1945 Bulgarian parliamentary election|Elections held a few weeks later]] resulted in a large majority for the Fatherland Front.\n\nIn September 1946, the monarchy was abolished by [[1946 Bulgarian republic referendum|plebiscite]], which resulted in 95.6 percent voting in favour of a republic, and young [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Tsar Simeon II]] was sent into exile. The Communists openly took power, and Bulgaria was declared a ''[[People's Republic]]''. [[Vasil Kolarov]], the number-three man in the party, became President. Over the next year, the Communists consolidated their hold on power. [[1946 Bulgarian Constitutional Assembly election|Elections for a constituent assembly in October 1946]] gave the Communists a majority. A month later, Dimitrov became prime minister.\n\nThe Agrarians refused to co-operate with the authorities, and in June 1947 their leader [[Nikola Petkov]] was arrested, despite strong international protests. This marked the establishment of a Communist establishment in Bulgaria. In December 1947, the constituent assembly ratified a new constitution for the republic, referred to as the \"[[Dimitrov Constitution]]\". The constitution was drafted with the help of Soviet jurists using the [[1936 Soviet Constitution]] as a model. By 1948, the remaining opposition parties were either realigned or dissolved; the [[Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers Party (Broad Socialists)|Social Democrats]] merged with the Communists, while the Agrarian Union became a loyal partner of the Communists.\n\nDuring 1948\u20131949, [[Orthodox Church of Bulgaria|Orthodox]], [[Muslim]], [[Protestant]] and [[Roman Catholic]] religious organizations were restrained or banned. The [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church of Bulgaria]] continued functioning but never regained the influence it held under the monarchy; many high roles within the church were assumed by communist functionaries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-1832.html|title=Bulgaria - Table A. Chronology of Important Events|website=Country-data.com|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nDimitrov died in 1949 and for a time Bulgaria adopted collective leadership. [[Vulko Chervenkov]] led the Communist Party and [[Vasil Kolarov]] was prime minister. This broke down a year later, when Kolarov died and Chervenkov added prime minister to his titles. Chervenkov started a process of rapid [[industrialization]] modelled after the [[Industrialization in the USSR|Soviet industrialisation]] led by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] in the 1930s and agriculture was collectivised.\n\nChervenkov's support base even in the Communist Party was too narrow for him to survive long once his patron Stalin was gone. In March 1954, a year after Stalin's death, Chervenkov was deposed as Party Secretary with the approval of the new leadership in [[Moscow]] and replaced by [[Todor Zhivkov]]. Chervenkov stayed on as Prime Minister until April 1956, when he was finally dismissed and replaced by [[Anton Yugov]].\n\n===Forced Macedonization in Pirin Macedonia===\nIn 1946, [[Stalin]] sent the following order to the Bulgarian delegation:\n{{quote|Cultural autonomy must be granted to [[Pirin Macedonia]] within the framework of Bulgaria. Tito has shown himself more flexible than you - possibly because he lives in a multiethnic state and has had to give equal rights to the various peoples. Autonomy will be the first step towards the unification of Macedonia, but in view of the present situation there should be no hurry on this matter. Otherwise, in the eyes of the Macedonian people the whole mission of achieving Macedonian autonomy will remain with Tito and you will get the criticism. You seem to be afraid of Kimon Georgiev, you have involved yourselves too much with him and do not want to give autonomy to Pirin Macedonia. That a Macedonian consciousness has not yet developed among the population is of no account. No such consciousness existed in Byelorussia either when we proclaimed it a Soviet Republic. However, later it was shown that a Byelorussian people did, in fact, exist<ref>[Stalin to Bulgarian Delegation (G. Dimitrov, V. Korarov, T. Kostov) on 7 June 1946</ref>}}\nThe government used force, threats and intimidation, branding opponents of the policy as fascists and chauvinists. Some were resettled as far as [[Vojvodina]] after they had been resettled from Pirin to [[SR Macedonia]] for unsuccessful Macedonisation.\n\nBulgaria adopted the Communist policy of closer rapprochement with Yugoslavia. Dimitrov then launched the initiative of a Balkan Federation that would range from Pirin to the [[Shar Mountains]] and reflect a Macedonian consciousness. For this purpose, he launched a policy of forced Macedonisation of the Bulgarian population in the Pirin region through conscious change of ethnic self-determination, held by means of administrative coercion and intensive propaganda.\n\nIn December 1946, he conducted a census in Pirin. State authorities instructed the local population in the Pirin region to mark administrative records such as \"Macedonian\", including [[Pomaks]], with the exception of those originating within the country. At its meeting on December 21, the Regional Committee of the Workers' Party in Upper Cuma decided to accept a formula indicating 70% of residents were \"Macedonians\". As a result, among the 281,015 inhabitants, 169,444 were identified as ethnic Macedonians.\n\nIn 1947 Bulgaria and Yugoslavia signed agreements whereby Pirin Macedonia became part of federal Yugoslavia, which proceeded to unify Pirin Macedonia with Vardar Macedonia and abolished visa regimes and removed customs services.\n\nShortly thereafter - in 1948, due to the rupture in relations between Tito and Stalin, the contract was dissolved. For a while, BCP and the Bulgarian state held contradictory, protivobalgarska policy on the Macedonian issue. In 1963 at the March Plenum of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, Zhivkov declared that the population in Pirin Macedonia was part of Bulgaria that was forced by the Communist Party.\n\n===Zhivkov era===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\n{{Eastern Bloc sidebar}}\n[[File:The Soviet Union 1969 CPA 3769 stamp (Hands holding torch, flags of Bulgaria, USSR, Bulgarian arms).jpg|right|thumb|200px|\"The friendship between the Soviet and the Bulgarian people \u2014 indestructible for eternity\", a 1969 Soviet stamp commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Socialist Revolution in Bulgaria]]\n[[File:Sofia, 1984.jpg|thumb|170px|right|The headquarters of the Bulgarian Communist party in 1984]]\n\nZhivkov became the leader of the BCP and remained in power for the next 33 years. The BCP retained its alliance with the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU), then led by [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. With conservative hardliners pushed aside, this brought in a period of liberal influence and reform. Relations were restored with [[Yugoslavia]], which had previously been shunned by the Soviet Union due to its anti-Stalinist stance, and [[Greece]]. The trials and executions of Traicho Kostov and other \"[[Titoism|Titoists]]\" (though not of [[Nikola Petkov]] and other non-Communist victims of the 1947 purges) were officially denounced. The party's militant [[anti-clericalism]] was relaxed and the Orthodox Church was no longer targeted.\n\nUpheavals in [[Polish October|Poland]] and [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungary in 1956]] did not spread to Bulgaria. The Party placed firm restrictions on publicising views considered to be anti-socialist or seditious. In the 1960s some economic reforms were adopted, which allowed the free sale of production that exceeded planned amounts. The country became the most popular tourist destination for people in the Eastern Bloc. Bulgaria produced commodities such as cigarettes and chocolate, which were hard to obtain in other socialist countries.\n\nYugov retired in 1962, and Zhivkov consequently became Prime Minister as well as Party Secretary. He survived the Soviet leadership transition from [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]] to [[Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev]] in 1964.\n\n===Debt crisis===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\nIn 1960, when Bulgaria could not pay its debts of $97 million to Western banks, Zhivkov personally addressed a written proposal to Khrushchev asking the USSR to purchase reserves gained over 66 years - from liberation in 1878 to 1944, including 22 tons of gold and 50 tons of silver.\n\nThe gold was taken to [[Novosibirsk]], where it was further refined and purchased for $35.10 per ounce, a total of 23 million dollars. In 2009, the value of that gold would be $639 million. In subsequent years Zhivkov conducted several secret operations with gold. Between 1960 and 1964 he sold 31.8 tons, using the proceeds to repay Bulgaria's debts mainly to Soviet banks.\n\n===16th republic of the Soviet Union===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\nOn 4 December 1963, Zhivkov proposed closer approximation and future merger of Bulgaria and the Soviet Union at the Central Committee plenum. This would make it the 16th Republic of the Soviet Union. The plenum unanimously approved Zhivkov's proposal.\n\n===Prague Spring===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\nIn 1968 Zhivkov again demonstrated his loyalty to the Soviet Union by taking a formal part in the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]]. His troops entered the country but did not take an active part in crushing the [[Prague Spring]]. At this point Bulgaria was generally regarded as the Soviet Union's most loyal Eastern European ally.\n\nThe operation involved the 12th and 22nd Infantry Regiments numbering 2,164 people and a [[T-34|T-34 tank]] battalion with 26 machines.\n\n===1971\u20131989===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\nAccording to declassified documents, Bulgaria planned on fomenting a crisis between [[Turkey]] and [[Greece]] in 1971. The operation was codenamed \"'''Cross'''\" and the plan was that Bulgarian secret agents would set fire in the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] and make it look like the work of Turks. The declassified documents state that \u201cAn intervention\u201d in the religious entity would have \u201csignificantly damage[d] Turkish-Greek relations and force[d] the [[United States]] to choose one side in the ensuing crisis,\u201d. In addition, the Bulgarians also planned to boost the effect of its operation against Greece and Turkey by conducting \u201cactive measures\" \u201cfor putting the enemy in a position of delusion.\" The plan was developed by the 7th Department of the First Main Directorate of the [[Committee for State Security (Bulgaria)|DS]] (intelligence and secret police services of communist Bulgaria), and was affirmed by Deputy Head of the Directorate on November 16, 1970, and approved by its Head. The operation was supposed to be prepared by the middle of 1971 and then executed, but it was abandoned.<ref>[http://archaeologyinbulgaria.com/2018/02/28/communist-bulgarias-intelligence-plotted-greece-turkey-conflict-setting-fire-ecumenical-patriarchate-constantinople-secret-files-reveal/ COMMUNIST BULGARIA\u2019S INTELLIGENCE PLOTTED GREECE \u2013 TURKEY CONFLICT BY SETTING ON FIRE ECUMENICAL PATRIARCHATE OF CONSTANTINOPLE, SECRET FILES REVEAL]</ref>\n\nIn 1971 the new \"Zhivkovskata\" Constitution added so-called. \"Article 1\", which grants the PA as the sole ruling a \"leading force of society and the state.\" Zhivkov was promoted to Head of State (Chairman of the State Council) and [[Stanko Todorov]] became Prime Minister.\n\nBulgaria signed the [[Helsinki Accords]] in 1975, which guaranteed [[human rights]] and fundamental freedoms, including freedom of movement, contacts, information, culture and education, right to work, and the rights to education and medical care. However, subsequent events regarding Bulgarian Turks in the 1980s were a direct violation of these commitments.\n\nIn 1978, Bulgaria attracted international attention when dissident writer [[Georgi Markov]] was accosted on a [[London]] street by a stranger who rammed his leg with the tip of an [[umbrella]]. Markov died shortly afterwards of [[ricin]] poisoning. He was the victim of the [[Committee for State Security (Bulgaria)|Bulgarian secret service]], as confirmed by KGB documents revealing that they had jointly planned the operation with Bulgaria.\n\nThe [[Bulgarian People's Army]] sided with the Soviet Union and the Afghan communists during the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]] in Afghanistan fighting the jihadist guerrillas from 1982 until its withdrawal in 1989.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/20/world/troops-of-5-soviet-allies-reported-fighting-guerillas-in-afghanistan.html|title=TROOPS OF 5 SOVIET ALLIES REPORTED FIGHTING GUERILLAS IN AFGHANISTAN|date=20 December 1982|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n===End of the People's Republic===\nBy the 1980s, the conservatives controlled the government. Some social and cultural liberalization and progress was led by [[Lyudmila Zhivkova]], Todor's daughter, who became a source of strong disapproval and annoyance to the Communist Party due to her unorthodox lifestyle that included the practicing of Eastern religions. She died in 1981, approaching her 39th birthday.\n\nA campaign of forced assimilation was waged against the ethnic Turkish minority, who were forbidden to speak the Turkish language<ref>Crampton, R.J., ''A Concise History of Bulgaria'', 2005, pp.205, Cambridge University Press</ref> and were forced to adopt Bulgarian names took place in the winter of 1984. The issue strained Bulgaria's economic relations with the West. The [[1989 expulsion of Turks from Bulgaria]] caused a significant drop in agricultural production in the southern regions due to the loss of around 300,000 workers.<ref name=cia1990>{{cite web|url=http://www.umsl.edu/services/govdocs/wofact90/world12.txt|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=7 February 2010|title=1990 CIA World Factbook}}</ref>\n[[File:Todor Jivkov.jpg|left|thumb|262x262px|Todor Zhivkov]]\nIn the late 1980s, the Communists, like their leader, had grown too feeble to resist the demand for change. Liberal outcry at the breakup of an environmental demonstration in Sofia in October 1989 broadened into a general campaign for political reform. More moderate elements in the Communist leadership reacted by deposing Zhivkov and replacing him with foreign minister [[Petar Mladenov]] on November 10, 1989.\n\nThis move gained a short respite for the Communist Party and prevented revolutionary change. Mladenov promised to open up the regime, stating that he supported [[Multi-party system|multi-party]] elections.

In the mid-1940s, when [[collectivisation]] began, Bulgaria was a primarily agrarian state, with some 80% of its population located in rural areas. Production facilities of all sectors were rapidly nationalised. [[Vulko Chervenkov|Chervenkov]] finally ended all private economic activity.\n\nBulgarian agricultural productivity increased rapidly after collectivisation. Large-scale mechanisation resulted in an immense growth in labour productivity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/7789/1/MPRA_paper_7789.pdf|format=PDF|title=Agricultural policies in Bulgaria in post Second World War years|page=5|website=Mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de|accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref> Government subsidies covered the large losses from the artificially low consumer prices.\n\nChervenkov's [[Stalinist]] policy led to a massive industrialisation and development of the energy sector, which remained one of Bulgaria's most advanced economic sectors. His rule lasted from 1950 to 1956, and saw the construction of dozens of dams and hydroelectric powerplants, chemical works, the [[Elatsite mine|Elatsite]] gold and copper mine and many others. The war-time coupon system was abolished, and healthcare and education were government provided. All this was achieved with strict government control and organization.

This resulted in surpluses of certain products, while other commodities were in deficit.\n\nThe other main trade partners were [[East Germany]] and [[Czechoslovakia]], while countries such as [[Mongolia]] and various African countries were also large-scale importers of Bulgarian goods.

republic]].\n\nThe People's Republic of Bulgaria existed from 1946 to 1990 and it was ruled by the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]] (BCP), which in turn ruled together with its coalition partner, the [[Bulgarian Agrarian People's Union]] (former communist ally). Bulgaria was part of [[Comecon]] and a member of the [[Warsaw Pact]] and was closely allied with the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Cold War]]. The [[Bulgarian resistance movement during World War II]] deposed the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] administration in the [[Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat of 1944]] which ended the country's alliance with the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]] and led to the People's Republic in 1946.\n\nThe BCP modelled its policies after those of the Soviet Union, transforming the country over the course of a decade from an [[Agrarian society|agrarian]] [[peasant society]] into an [[industrialized]] [[Communist state|socialist society]]. In the mid-1950s and after the death of [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], conservative hardliners lost influence and a period of social [[liberalization]] and stability followed under [[Todor Zhivkov]]. Varying degrees of conservative or liberal influence followed. After a new energy and transportation infrastructure was constructed, by 1960 manufacturing became the dominant sector of the economy and Bulgaria became a major exporter of household goods and later on computer technologies, earning it the nickname of \"[[Silicon Valley]] of the [[Eastern Bloc]]\". The country's relatively high productivity levels and high scores on social development rankings made it a model for other [[socialist countries]]' administrative policies.\n\nIn 1989, after a few years of liberal influence, political reforms were initiated and [[Todor Zhivkov]], who had served as head of the party since 1954, was removed from office in a BCP congress. In 1990, under the leadership of [[Georgi Parvanov]], the BCP changed its name to the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]] (BSP) and adopted a [[centre-left]] political ideology in place of [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]]. Following the BSP victory in the [[1990 Bulgarian Constitutional Assembly election|1990 election]], which was the first openly contested [[multi-party system|multi-party]] election since [[1931 Bulgarian parliamentary election|1931]], the name of the state was changed to the [[Republic of Bulgaria]]. Geographically, the People's Republic of Bulgaria had the same borders as present-day Bulgaria and it bordered the [[Black Sea]] to the east; [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] to the north; [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] (via [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]) to the west and [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] to the south.\n\n==History==\n{{main|Bulgaria in World War II}}\nOn 1 March 1941, the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] signed the [[Tripartite Pact]], and officially became a member of [[Axis Powers|the Axis]]. Following the German invasion of Yugoslavia and Greece in April, Bulgaria came to occupy large parts of those countries. In 1942, the [[Fatherland Front (Bulgaria)|Fatherland Front]] was formed from a mixture of Communists, [[Socialists]] and [[Liberalism|Liberals]].\n\nThe highest estimate for the number of [[Bulgarian resistance movement during World War II|partisans]] at any one time in Bulgaria is 18,000.<ref>{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=8_zeaeTOz6YC}}|title=Who are the Macedonians?|last=Poulton|first=Hugh|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|year=2000|isbn=978-0-253-21359-4}}</ref>\n\n===Communist coup===\nIn 1944, with the [[Jassy\u2013Kishinev Offensive|entry]] of the [[Red Army]] into Romania, the Kingdom of Bulgaria renounced the Axis and declared neutrality. On 5 September, the Soviet Union declared war on the kingdom and three days later the Red Army entered north-eastern Bulgaria, prompting the government to declare support in order to minimise military conflict. On 9 September, communist partisans launched a [[Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat of 1944|coup d'\u00e9tat]] which ''de facto'' ended the rule of the [[Bulgarian monarchy]] and its administration, after which a new government assumed power led by the Fatherland Front (FF), which itself was led by the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]].\n\n===Early years and Chervenkov era===\n[[File:Georgi Dimitrov.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Georgi Dimitrov, leader of the Bulgarian Communist Party from 1946\u20131949]]\nAfter taking power, the FF formed a coalition led by former Primate Minister [[Kimon Georgiev]], which included the Social Democrats and the Agrarians. Under the terms of the peace settlement, Bulgaria was allowed to keep [[Southern Dobruja]], but formally renounced all claims to Greek and Yugoslav territory. 150,000 Bulgarians settled during the occupation were expelled from [[Western Thrace]]. The Communists deliberately took a minor role in the new government at first, while the Soviet representatives held the real power. A Communist-controlled People's Militia was set up, which harassed and intimidated non-Communist parties.\n\nOn 1 February 1945, [[Regent]] [[Prince Kiril of Bulgaria|Prince Kiril]], former Prime Minister [[Bogdan Filov]], and hundreds of other officials of the kingdom were arrested on charges of war crimes. By June, Kirill and the other Regents, twenty-two former ministers, and many others had been executed. The new government began to arrest Nazi collaborators. Thousands of people were charged with treason or participating in counter-revolutionary conspiracy and sentenced to either death or life in prison.<ref name=\"Hanna Arendt Centre\">Hanna Arendt Centre in Sofia, with Dinyu Sharlanov and Venelin I.

This strengthened when it became apparent that the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] had little interest in Bulgaria. In November 1945, Communist Party leader [[Georgi Dimitrov]] returned to Bulgaria after 22 years in exile. He made a truculent speech that rejected cooperation with opposition groups. [[1945 Bulgarian parliamentary election|Elections held a few weeks later]] resulted in a large majority for the Fatherland Front.\n\nIn September 1946, the monarchy was abolished by [[1946 Bulgarian republic referendum|plebiscite]], which resulted in 95.6 percent voting in favour of a republic, and young [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Tsar Simeon II]] was sent into exile. The Communists openly took power, and Bulgaria was declared a ''[[People's Republic]]''. [[Vasil Kolarov]], the number-three man in the party, became President. Over the next year, the Communists consolidated their hold on power. [[1946 Bulgarian Constitutional Assembly election|Elections for a constituent assembly in October 1946]] gave the Communists a majority. A month later, Dimitrov became prime minister.\n\nThe Agrarians refused to co-operate with the authorities, and in June 1947 their leader [[Nikola Petkov]] was arrested, despite strong international protests. This marked the establishment of a Communist establishment in Bulgaria. In December 1947, the constituent assembly ratified a new constitution for the republic, referred to as the \"[[Dimitrov Constitution]]\". The constitution was drafted with the help of Soviet jurists using the [[1936 Soviet Constitution]] as a model. By 1948, the remaining opposition parties were either realigned or dissolved; the [[Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers Party (Broad Socialists)|Social Democrats]] merged with the Communists, while the Agrarian Union became a loyal partner of the Communists.\n\nDuring 1948\u20131949, [[Orthodox Church of Bulgaria|Orthodox]], [[Muslim]], [[Protestant]] and [[Roman Catholic]] religious organizations were restrained or banned. The [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church of Bulgaria]] continued functioning but never regained the influence it held under the monarchy; many high roles within the church were assumed by communist functionaries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-1832.html|title=Bulgaria - Table A. Chronology of Important Events|website=Country-data.com|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nDimitrov died in 1949 and for a time Bulgaria adopted collective leadership. [[Vulko Chervenkov]] led the Communist Party and [[Vasil Kolarov]] was prime minister. This broke down a year later, when Kolarov died and Chervenkov added prime minister to his titles. Chervenkov started a process of rapid [[industrialization]] modelled after the [[Industrialization in the USSR|Soviet industrialisation]] led by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] in the 1930s and agriculture was collectivised.\n\nChervenkov's support base even in the Communist Party was too narrow for him to survive long once his patron Stalin was gone. In March 1954, a year after Stalin's death, Chervenkov was deposed as Party Secretary with the approval of the new leadership in [[Moscow]] and replaced by [[Todor Zhivkov]]. Chervenkov stayed on as Prime Minister until April 1956, when he was finally dismissed and replaced by [[Anton Yugov]].\n\n===Forced Macedonization in Pirin Macedonia===\nIn 1946, [[Stalin]] sent the following order to the Bulgarian delegation:\n{{quote|Cultural autonomy must be granted to [[Pirin Macedonia]] within the framework of Bulgaria. Tito has shown himself more flexible than you - possibly because he lives in a multiethnic state and has had to give equal rights to the various peoples. Autonomy will be the first step towards the unification of Macedonia, but in view of the present situation there should be no hurry on this matter. Otherwise, in the eyes of the Macedonian people the whole mission of achieving Macedonian autonomy will remain with Tito and you will get the criticism. You seem to be afraid of Kimon Georgiev, you have involved yourselves too much with him and do not want to give autonomy to Pirin Macedonia. That a Macedonian consciousness has not yet developed among the population is of no account. No such consciousness existed in Byelorussia either when we proclaimed it a Soviet Republic. However, later it was shown that a Byelorussian people did, in fact, exist<ref>[Stalin to Bulgarian Delegation (G. Dimitrov, V. Korarov, T. Kostov) on 7 June 1946</ref>}}\nThe government used force, threats and intimidation, branding opponents of the policy as fascists and chauvinists. Some were resettled as far as [[Vojvodina]] after they had been resettled from Pirin to [[SR Macedonia]] for unsuccessful Macedonisation.\n\nBulgaria adopted the Communist policy of closer rapprochement with Yugoslavia. Dimitrov then launched the initiative of a Balkan Federation that would range from Pirin to the [[Shar Mountains]] and reflect a Macedonian consciousness. For this purpose, he launched a policy of forced Macedonisation of the Bulgarian population in the Pirin region through conscious change of ethnic self-determination, held by means of administrative coercion and intensive propaganda.\n\nIn December 1946, he conducted a census in Pirin. State authorities instructed the local population in the Pirin region to mark administrative records such as \"Macedonian\", including [[Pomaks]], with the exception of those originating within the country. At its meeting on December 21, the Regional Committee of the Workers' Party in Upper Cuma decided to accept a formula indicating 70% of residents were \"Macedonians\". As a result, among the 281,015 inhabitants, 169,444 were identified as ethnic Macedonians.\n\nIn 1947 Bulgaria and Yugoslavia signed agreements whereby Pirin Macedonia became part of federal Yugoslavia, which proceeded to unify Pirin Macedonia with Vardar Macedonia and abolished visa regimes and removed customs services.\n\nShortly thereafter - in 1948, due to the rupture in relations between Tito and Stalin, the contract was dissolved. For a while, BCP and the Bulgarian state held contradictory, protivobalgarska policy on the Macedonian issue. In 1963 at the March Plenum of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, Zhivkov declared that the population in Pirin Macedonia was part of Bulgaria that was forced by the Communist Party.\n\n===Zhivkov era===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\n{{Eastern Bloc sidebar}}\n[[File:The Soviet Union 1969 CPA 3769 stamp (Hands holding torch, flags of Bulgaria, USSR, Bulgarian arms).jpg|right|thumb|200px|\"The friendship between the Soviet and the Bulgarian people \u2014 indestructible for eternity\", a 1969 Soviet stamp commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Socialist Revolution in Bulgaria]]\n[[File:Sofia, 1984.jpg|thumb|170px|right|The headquarters of the Bulgarian Communist party in 1984]]\n\nZhivkov became the leader of the BCP and remained in power for the next 33 years. The BCP retained its alliance with the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU), then led by [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. With conservative hardliners pushed aside, this brought in a period of liberal influence and reform. Relations were restored with [[Yugoslavia]], which had previously been shunned by the Soviet Union due to its anti-Stalinist stance, and [[Greece]]. The trials and executions of Traicho Kostov and other \"[[Titoism|Titoists]]\" (though not of [[Nikola Petkov]] and other non-Communist victims of the 1947 purges) were officially denounced. The party's militant [[anti-clericalism]] was relaxed and the Orthodox Church was no longer targeted.\n\nUpheavals in [[Polish October|Poland]] and [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungary in 1956]] did not spread to Bulgaria. The Party placed firm restrictions on publicising views considered to be anti-socialist or seditious. In the 1960s some economic reforms were adopted, which allowed the free sale of production that exceeded planned amounts. The country became the most popular tourist destination for people in the Eastern Bloc. Bulgaria produced commodities such as cigarettes and chocolate, which were hard to obtain in other socialist countries.\n\nYugov retired in 1962, and Zhivkov consequently became Prime Minister as well as Party Secretary. He survived the Soviet leadership transition from [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]] to [[Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev]] in 1964.\n\n===Debt crisis===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\nIn 1960, when Bulgaria could not pay its debts of $97 million to Western banks, Zhivkov personally addressed a written proposal to Khrushchev asking the USSR to purchase reserves gained over 66 years - from liberation in 1878 to 1944, including 22 tons of gold and 50 tons of silver.\n\nThe gold was taken to [[Novosibirsk]], where it was further refined and purchased for $35.10 per ounce, a total of 23 million dollars. In 2009, the value of that gold would be $639 million. In subsequent years Zhivkov conducted several secret operations with gold. Between 1960 and 1964 he sold 31.8 tons, using the proceeds to repay Bulgaria's debts mainly to Soviet banks.\n\n===16th republic of the Soviet Union===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\nOn 4 December 1963, Zhivkov proposed closer approximation and future merger of Bulgaria and the Soviet Union at the Central Committee plenum. This would make it the 16th Republic of the Soviet Union. The plenum unanimously approved Zhivkov's proposal.\n\n===Prague Spring===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\nIn 1968 Zhivkov again demonstrated his loyalty to the Soviet Union by taking a formal part in the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]]. His troops entered the country but did not take an active part in crushing the [[Prague Spring]]. At this point Bulgaria was generally regarded as the Soviet Union's most loyal Eastern European ally.\n\nThe operation involved the 12th and 22nd Infantry Regiments numbering 2,164 people and a [[T-34|T-34 tank]] battalion with 26 machines.\n\n===1971\u20131989===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\nAccording to declassified documents, Bulgaria planned on fomenting a crisis between [[Turkey]] and [[Greece]] in 1971. The operation was codenamed \"'''Cross'''\" and the plan was that Bulgarian secret agents would set fire in the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] and make it look like the work of Turks. The declassified documents state that \u201cAn intervention\u201d in the religious entity would have \u201csignificantly damage[d] Turkish-Greek relations and force[d] the [[United States]] to choose one side in the ensuing crisis,\u201d. In addition, the Bulgarians also planned to boost the effect of its operation against Greece and Turkey by conducting \u201cactive measures\" \u201cfor putting the enemy in a position of delusion.\" The plan was developed by the 7th Department of the First Main Directorate of the [[Committee for State Security|DS]] (intelligence and secret police services of communist Bulgaria), and was affirmed by Deputy Head of the Directorate on November 16, 1970, and approved by its Head. The operation was supposed to be prepared by the middle of 1971 and then executed, but it was abandoned.<ref>[http://archaeologyinbulgaria.com/2018/02/28/communist-bulgarias-intelligence-plotted-greece-turkey-conflict-setting-fire-ecumenical-patriarchate-constantinople-secret-files-reveal/ COMMUNIST BULGARIA\u2019S INTELLIGENCE PLOTTED GREECE \u2013 TURKEY CONFLICT BY SETTING ON FIRE ECUMENICAL PATRIARCHATE OF CONSTANTINOPLE, SECRET FILES REVEAL]</ref>\n\nIn 1971 the new \"Zhivkovskata\" Constitution added so-called. \"Article 1\", which grants the PA as the sole ruling a \"leading force of society and the state.\" Zhivkov was promoted to Head of State (Chairman of the State Council) and [[Stanko Todorov]] became Prime Minister.\n\nBulgaria signed the [[Helsinki Accords]] in 1975, which guaranteed [[human rights]] and fundamental freedoms, including freedom of movement, contacts, information, culture and education, right to work, and the rights to education and medical care. However, subsequent events regarding Bulgarian Turks in the 1980s were a direct violation of these commitments.\n\nIn 1978, Bulgaria attracted international attention when dissident writer [[Georgi Markov]] was accosted on a [[London]] street by a stranger who rammed his leg with the tip of an [[umbrella]]. Markov died shortly afterwards of [[ricin]] poisoning. He was the victim of the [[Committee for State Security|Bulgarian secret service]], as confirmed by KGB documents revealing that they had jointly planned the operation with Bulgaria.\n\nThe [[Bulgarian People's Army]] sided with the Soviet Union and the Afghan communists during the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]] in Afghanistan fighting the jihadist guerrillas from 1982 until its withdrawal in 1989.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/20/world/troops-of-5-soviet-allies-reported-fighting-guerillas-in-afghanistan.html|title=TROOPS OF 5 SOVIET ALLIES REPORTED FIGHTING GUERILLAS IN AFGHANISTAN|date=20 December 1982|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n===End of the People's Republic===\nBy the 1980s, the conservatives controlled the government. Some social and cultural liberalization and progress was led by [[Lyudmila Zhivkova]], Todor's daughter, who became a source of strong disapproval and annoyance to the Communist Party due to her unorthodox lifestyle that included the practicing of Eastern religions. She died in 1981, approaching her 39th birthday.\n\nA campaign of forced assimilation was waged against the ethnic Turkish minority, who were forbidden to speak the Turkish language<ref>Crampton, R.J., ''A Concise History of Bulgaria'', 2005, pp.205, Cambridge University Press</ref> and were forced to adopt Bulgarian names took place in the winter of 1984. The issue strained Bulgaria's economic relations with the West.

Liberal outcry at the breakup of an environmental demonstration in Sofia in October 1989 broadened into a general campaign for political reform. More moderate elements in the Communist leadership reacted by deposing Zhivkov and replacing him with foreign minister [[Petar Mladenov]] on November 10, 1989.\n\nThis move gained a short respite for the Communist Party and prevented revolutionary change. Mladenov promised to open up the regime, stating that he supported [[Multi-party system|multi-party]] elections. Demonstrations throughout the country led Mladenov to announce that the Communist Party would cede its monopoly over the political system. On January 15, 1990, the National Assembly formally amended the legal code to abolish the Communist Party's \"leading role\". In June 1990, the [[1990 Bulgarian parliamentary election|first multi-party elections since 1939]] were held. Finally on 15 November 1990, the 7th [[National Assembly (Bulgaria)#Grand National Assembly|Grand National Assembly]] voted to change the country's name to the Republic of Bulgaria and removed the Communist state emblem from the national flag.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,UKHO,,BGR,,3ae6a69e8,0.html | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120915055810/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,UKHO,,BGR,,3ae6a69e8,0.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=15 September 2012 | publisher=[[Home Office|United Kingdom Home Office]] | title=UK Home Office Immigration and Nationality Directorate Country Assessment - Bulgaria | date=1 March 1999 | accessdate=2011-11-14 }}</ref>\n\nIt is estimated that, beginning in 1944, between 50,000 and 100,000 people were killed in Bulgaria as part of agricultural collectivisation and political repression, although documentation is insufficient for a definitive judgement.

In the mid-1940s, when [[collectivisation]] began, Bulgaria was a primarily agrarian state, with some 80% of its population located in rural areas. Production facilities of all sectors were rapidly nationalised. [[Vulko Chervenkov|Chervenkov]] finally ended all private economic activity.\n\nBulgarian agricultural productivity increased rapidly after collectivisation. Large-scale mechanisation resulted in an immense growth in labour productivity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/7789/1/MPRA_paper_7789.pdf|format=PDF|title=Agricultural policies in Bulgaria in post Second World War years|page=5|website=Mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de|accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref> Government subsidies covered the large losses from the artificially low consumer prices.\n\nChervenkov's [[Stalinist]] policy led to a massive industrialisation and development of the energy sector, which remained one of Bulgaria's most advanced economic sectors. His rule lasted from 1950 to 1956, and saw the construction of dozens of dams and hydroelectric powerplants, chemical works, the [[Elatsite mine|Elatsite]] gold and copper mine and many others. The war-time coupon system was abolished, and healthcare and education were government provided. All this was achieved with strict government control and organization.

After his death, it became the home of his widow, [[Maria Feodorovna (Sophie Dorothea of W\u00fcrttemberg)|Maria Feodorovna]]. The palace and the large [[English garden]] surrounding it are now a Russian state museum and public park.\n\n==Creation==\nIn 1777, the Empress [[Catherine II of Russia]] gave a parcel of a thousand hectares of forest along the winding [[Slavyanka River]], four kilometers from her residence at Tsarskoye Selo, to her son and heir Paul I and his wife [[Maria Feodorovna (Sophie Dorothea of W\u00fcrttemberg)|Maria Feodorovna]], to celebrate the birth of their first son, the future [[Alexander I of Russia]]. At the time the land was given to Paul and Maria Feodorovna, there were two rustic log lodges called ''Krik'' and ''Krak''. Paul and his wife spent the summers of 1777 to 1780 in Krik, while their new homes and the garden were being built.<ref>Massie, p. 15</ref>\n\nThey began by building two wooden buildings, one kilometer apart. Paul's house, a two-story house in the Dutch style, with small gardens, was called \"Marienthal\", or the \"Valley of Maria\". Maria's house was a small wooden house with a cupola and flower beds, named \"Paullust\", or \"Paul's Joy\". Paul and Maria Feodorovna began to create picturesque \"ruins\", a Chinese kiosk, Chinese bridges and classical temples in the [[English landscape garden]] style which had spread rapidly across Europe in the second half of the 18th century.<ref>Orloff and Chvidkovsky, p. 289</ref> \n\nIn 1780, Catherine the Great loaned her official architect, the Scotsman [[Charles Cameron (architect)|Charles Cameron]], to design a palace on a hillside overlooking the Slavyanka River, near the site of Marienthal. Cameron had studied under English architect [[Isaac Ware]], who was close to [[William Kent]]. Kent introduced the [[Palladian]] style of architecture into England with his work at [[Chiswick House]] for [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Lord Burlington]]. Through this connection Cameron became familiar with the original plans of Palladio, which were in the personal collection of Lord Burlington. This style was the major influence on Cameron when he designed Pavlovsk.<ref>Orloff and Chvidkovsky, p. 290</ref>\n\nCameron began his project not with the palace itself but with two classical pavilions. The first was the Temple of Friendship, a circular [[Dorians|Dorian]] temple with sixteen columns supporting a low dome, containing a statue of Catherine the Great. It was placed at a bend of the Slavyanka River, below the future palace, and was surrounded by silver poplars and transplanted Siberian pines. The second was the Apollo Colonnade, a double row of columns with an entablature, forming a setting for a reproduction of the Belvedere Apollo. It was placed at the entrance of the park, and it was made of porous limestone with a coarse finish; the surfaces suggest that they had been aged by centuries of weather. At the same time the Slavyanka River was dammed, to create a lake which would mirror the facade of the palace above.<ref>Massie, p. 20</ref>\n\nMaria Feodorovna also insisted in having several rustic structures which recalled the palace where she grew up at \u00c9tupes, forty miles from [[Basel]], in what was then the Duchy of [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] and today is in ''Alsace''. Cameron constructed a small Swiss chalet with a library; a dairy of rough stones with a thatched roof, where milk products were kept and prepared, and an [[aviary]] in the form of a small classical temple with metal netting between the Dorian columns, which was filled with [[nightingale]]s, [[European goldfinch|goldfinch]], [[starling]]s and [[quail]]. For the palace itself, Cameron conceived a country house which seems to have been based on a design of [[Andrea Palladio]] shown in a woodcut in his book ''[[I quattro libri dell'architettura]]'', for the [[Villa Capra \"La Rotonda\"]] near Vicenza in Italy. This same drawing was later used by [[Thomas Jefferson]] in his design for the [[University of Virginia]]. The palace he designed had a cube-shaped central block three stories high with a low dome supported by sixty-four columns. On either side of the building were two single story colonnades of curved open winged galleries connected to service buildings one and a half stories high. Each facade of the palace was decorated with molded friezes and reliefs.<ref>Massie, p. 22.</ref>\n\nIn September 1781, as construction of the Pavlovsk Palace began, Paul and Maria set off on a journey to Austria, Italy, France and Germany. They traveled under the incognito of \"The Count and Countess of the North\". During their travels they saw the palaces and French gardens of Versailles and Chantilly, which strongly influenced the future appearance of Pavlovsk Park. [[King Louis XVI]] presented them with four [[Gobelin tapestry|Gobelin tapestries]], Marie Antoinette presented Maria Feodorovna with a sixty-piece toilet set of S\u00e8vres porcelain, and they ordered more sets of porcelain and purchased statues, busts, paintings, furniture and paintings, all for Pavlovsk. While they traveled, they kept in contact almost daily with Kuchelbecker, the supervisor of construction at Pavlovsk, sending back and forth drawings, plans and notes on the smallest details.<ref name=m32>Massie, p. 32</ref>\n\nPaul and Maria Feodorovna returned in November 1782, and they continued to fill Pavlovsk with art objects. A shipment of antique marbles, statues, busts, urns, and pottery discovered and purchased at [[Pompei]], arrived in 1783. Sixteen sets of furniture, over two hundred pieces, were ordered from Paris between 1783-85 for the State Rooms. In 1784, twelve Hubert Robert landscapes were commissioned for Pavlovsk. The couple purchased ninety-six clocks from Europe. The Imperial Glass factory, made special chandeliers for each room. In the midst of the construction, tensions grew between them and Cameron. Cameron was used to the unlimited budget for materials given him by Catherine the Great, while Catherine gave very little money to Paul; and Cameron was annoyed by the furniture, tapestries and fireplaces brought back from Europe by Maria Feodorovna without consulting him. Maria Feodorovna in turn was annoyed by the bright polychrome decoration and Pompeian arabesques used by Cameron, and wanted more delicate colors, and Paul did not like anything that resembled the style of his mother's house, the Catherine Palace at Tsarskoye Selo.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nThe tensions led to a parting in 1786. Cameron left to build a new palace for Catherine in the Crimea. He had finished entry vestibule and the five rooms of the private apartments. The work of decorating the interior was taken over by an Italian architect, [[Vincenzo Brenna]], from Florence, who had come to Russia in 1783. Brenna designed interiors which reflected Paul's taste for Roman classicism. He created the white and gold Halls of War and Peace, on either side of the Greek Hall by Cameron, which had a colonnade of green false marble columns, resembling a Greek temple. He made the Italian hall into a replica of a Roman temple, and he built the State Bedroom for Maria Feodorovna as an imitation of the state bedroom of the King of France, with a huge gilded bed, and cream silk wallpaper painted in tempura with colorful flowers, fruit, musical instruments and gardening tools.<ref name=m32/>\n\nCatherine the Great died in 1796, and Paul became Emperor. He decided to enlarge Pavlovsk into a palace suitable for a royal residence, adding two new wings on either side of the main building, and a church attached to the south wing. Between 1797 and 1799, he lavished money and the finest materials on Brenna's interiors. The reign of Emperor Paul did not last long. He alienated the nobles, and became increasingly fearful of conspiracies. His fears were justified; the Emperor Paul was murdered by members of his court in 1801, and his son Alexander became Emperor. Pavlovsk Palace became the residence of the Empress Maria Feodorovna (1759\u20131828), the mother of both Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia]] and Emperor [[Nicholas I of Russia]]. \n\nShe turned the house into a memorial to her murdered husband, filled with his furniture and portraits, and made the house a showcase for finest 18th-century French furnishings, paintings, sculpture and porcelain. Another disaster struck Pavlovsk in 1803; a fire caused by a defective chimney destroyed a major part of the interior of the palace, including all the decor of the State Apartments and living rooms. Most of the furniture was saved, along with some door panels, fireplaces and mirrors, but most of the Palace had to be rebuilt.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nMaria Feodorovna brought Cameron and Brenna's young assistant, the Italian architect [[Carlo Rossi (architect)|Carlo Rossi]], to help restore the Palace. She also employed a Russian architect, Andrei Voronykhin, who had been born a serf, and was trained in decoration and design, who rose to become the architect of Kazan Cathedral in St. Petersburg. Voronykhin was named chief architect of Pavlovsk by Maria Feodorovna. He brought back the architect [[Giacomo Quarenghi|Quarenghi]], who had redecorated five rooms on the main floor, to recreate his work. He remade some of the rooms, such as the Tapestry Room and the State Bedroom, exactly as they had been, but for other rooms he added decoration inspired by Roman models discovered at Pompeii and Herculaneum; Roman-style lamps, furniture, Roman couches, and chairs copied after those of Roman senators. \n\nFollowing the French taste of the time for Egyptian art, he added black Egyptian statues in the entry vestibule of the Palace, He  redesigned the Greek and Italian halls, replacing the molding on the walls with false marble, and he added a Russian touch; fireplaces faced with Russian [[lapis-lazuli]] and [[jasper]], which had originally been in the Mikhailovsky Palace that Paul had built in St. Petersburg. Voronykhin also made plans for a semi-circular library in one of the wings, which was later built by Carlo Rossi, and he redesigned the private apartments of Maria Feodorovna on the ground floor, which included a library, boudoir and bedroom. He installed French doors and large windows in the apartment, so the [[flower garden]] outside seemed to be part of the interior.<ref>Massie, p. 70</ref>\n\nIn 1805 Voronykhin built the Centaur bridge in the park, and the Visconti bridge, which crossed the Slavyanka at a point it was filled with water lilies. His last construction in the park was the Rose Pavilion, built in 1811, a simple structure surrounded entirely by rosebushes. The Rose Pavilion was the site of a grand fete on 12 July 1814, celebrating the return of Alexander I to St. Petersburg after the defeat of Napoleon. For the occasion, architect Pietro de Gottardo Gonzaga built a ballroom the size of the Rose Pavilion itself in just seventeen days, and surrounded it with huge canvases of Russian villagers celebrating the victory. The ball inside the pavilion opened with a Polonaise led by Alexander and his mother, and ended with a huge display of fireworks. In her later years Maria Feodorovna had a literary salon at Pavlovsk, which was frequented by poet [[Vasily Zhukovsky]], fabulist [[Ivan Krylov]], and historian [[Nikolai Karamzin]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nThe last great St. Petersburg architect to work at Pavlovsk was Carlo Rossi, who in 1824 designed the library, which contained more than twenty thousand books as well as collections of rare coins and butterflies. He also designed the Corner Salon, where Maria Feodorovna received guests such as the first American Ambassador to Russia, [[John Quincy Adams]], and the Lavender Room, whose walls were made of lilac-colored false marble, matching the lilac flowers outside the windows. These rooms were furnished with furniture made of native Russian woods, including Karelian birch, poplar and walnut.<ref>Massie, p. 99</ref>\n\nMaria Feodorovna died on 24 October 1828, fourteen days after her sixty-seventh birthday. She left the house to her younger son, Michael, and specified that none of the furniture should be taken away. After Michael's death, it went to the second son of Nicholas I, Konstantine Nikolayevich. It then passed to his widow and then their eldest son, Konstantine Konstantinovich. Her descendants respected the will, and turned the house into a family museum, just as it was when she died.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n==After the Russian Revolution==\nAt the time of the Russian Revolution in 1917, the eldest son of Constantine Constantinovich, Prince [[Ioann Konstantinovich of Russia]], along with his wife, [[Princess Helen of Serbia]], the daughter of King [[Peter I of Serbia]], were living in one of the wings of Pavlovsk, together with his father's widowed sister [[Queen Olga of Greece]]. As the political situation deteriorated, they left, and the house was left to the care of Alexander Polovotsoff, director of the Art Institute and the Museum of Applied Arts in St. Petersburg. \n\nWhen Lenin and the Bolsheviks seized power in November 1917, Polovtsoff went to the Winter Palace, found [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]], the Commissar of Enlightenment of the new government, and demanded that Pavlovsk be saved as a museum. Lunacharsky agreed and named him Commissar Curator of Pavlovsk. He returned to the Palace and found that a group of revolutionary sailors had searched the Palace for weapons and taken a few sabers, but otherwise everything was in its place. He hired former soldiers to guard the house, put all the furniture into the main building, made an inventory of all the treasures in the Palace, and successfully resisted demands from various revolutionary committees for dishes, chairs, tables, and all the books from the library. He was able to persuade Lunacharsky himself to come to Pavlovsk.\n\nAfter Lunacharsky's visit, Pavlovsk was officially confiscated, but turned into a museum, open to the public two or three days a week. Having succeeded in saving the Palace, Polovtsoff took family and belongings and slipped across the border to Finland and moved to Paris.<ref>Polovtsoff, Alexander, Les Tresors d'Art en Russie sous le regime Bolsheviste, Paris, P. Pavlovsky and Co., 1919. Cited in Massie.</ref>\n\n==World War II==\n{{one source|section|date=February 2017}}\nThe German attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941 and the swiftness of the German advance took the Soviet government by surprise. The morning after the attack, the curators of Pavlovsk, under the direction of museum curator Anatoliy Kuchumov, began to pack as many of art objects as possible, starting with the S\u00e8vres porcelain toilet set given by Louis XVI to Maria Feodorovna and Paul in 1780. Ninety-six hours after the announcement of the beginning of the war, the first thirty-four crates were being carried from the palace by horse-drawn cart. Boards were put over the windows, and sand on the floor of the Palace. Thirty curators often worked by candlelight, and by July there were air raids. The paintings, chandeliers, crystal, porcelain, rare furniture, and works of ivory and amber were packed and sent first. They worked with great care \u2013 each piece of furniture had to be carefully dismantled, porcelain vases had to be separated from the bases, and delicate clocks had to have their casing and mechanisms separated and packed separately, with diagrams on how to put them back together. One piece of each set of furniture was saved, and the others left behind. The Roman and Greek antiquities were too heavy and delicate to move, so they were taken to the basements, placed as close together as possible, and then hidden by a brick wall.{{cn|date=August 2018}}\n\nBy the third week of August thirteen thousand objects, plus all the documentation, had been packed and sent away. Some crates were sent to Gorky, others to Sarapul, and the last group, on 20 August 1941, went to Leningrad, where the crates were stored in the basement of [[St Isaac's Cathedral]]. The last shipment included the chandelier from the Italian Hall and the jasper vases from the Greek Hall. On 30 August, the last rail link from Leningrad to Moscow was cut, and the city was under blockade. By 28 August, the Germans were fifty kilometers from Pavlovsk. A Soviet division headquarters was located in one wing of the palace. As the Germans approached, the park and palace came under bombardment. The museum staff began to bury the statues which were too heavy to evacuate. They calculated that the Germans would not dig deeper than one meter eighty centimeters, so they buried all the statues as deep as three meters. The statues of the Three Graces were buried three meters beneath the private garden of Maria Feodorovna. Their calculations were correct; the statues were still there after the war.<ref name=\"Massie, p. 273\">Massie, p. 273</ref> \n\nOn 16 September, the last soldiers left, and the Germans took over Pavlovsk Palace, still occupied by a group of elderly women guardians. The Germans occupied Pavlovsk palace for two and a half years. Officers were quartered in the salons on the first floor, and the ballroom was made into a garage for cars and motorcycles. Barracks were located in the north wing and a hospital in the south wing. German soldiers, Dutch soldiers and Spanish soldiers in special units of the German army occupied the buildings in the park. The sculpture and furniture that remained in the house and all the books of the Rossi Library were taken to Germany. The statue of Emperor Paul in the courtyard was used as a telephone pole. The Germans did not discover the antiquities hidden behind the brick wall in the basement.<ref name=\"Massie, p. 273\">Massie, p. 273</ref>\n\nPavlovsk was retaken, ironically, Zhdhanov, Zhdhanokshchina, and Stalin's Purges in 1917-1953, did as much psychological Damage as the Siege, on before, on and after, on 24 January 1944. When the Soviet troops arrived, the palace had already been burning for three days. The main building of the Palace was a hollow shell, without a roof or floors. The north wall had fallen. Most of the parquet floors of the palace had been used as firewood; a few pieces were found in unburned portions of the palace near the stoves. Of the more than 100,000 trees that had been in the park before the War, at least 70 percent had been cut down or destroyed by shelling. All the decorative bridges in the park had been blown up. Eight hundred bunkers had been dug in the park. The Rose Pavilion was gone; the Germans had used the materials to construct a fortified dugout.<ref name=\"Massie, p. 273\"/>\n\n==Restoration==\n{{refimprove section|date=February 2017}}\nOn 18 February 1944, a meeting was held at the House of Architects in Leningrad to discuss the fate of the ruined Palaces. Academician and architect Aleksei Shchusev, who had designed the Lenin Mausoleum, called for the immediate reconstruction of the Palaces. \"If we do not do this\", he said, \"we who know and remember these palaces in all their glory as they were, then the next generation will never be able to reconstruct them.\"<ref>Massie, p. 279</ref> \n\nEven before the war had ended, the Soviet government decided to restore Pavlovsk and the other ruined palaces around Leningrad. First the mines had to be cleared from the ruins and palace and the park. Then the remaining walls were supported with scaffolding, and casts were made of the remaining molding. Fragments of plaster molding were collected, sorting, and casts made. The color of paint still on the remaining walls was carefully noted for later copying. Photographs and early plans of the palace were brought together to help with the restoration.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nAs soon as the war ended, a search began for treasures stolen from the Palace. Curators collected pieces of furniture, fabric, the legs of tables and pieces of doors and gilded cornices from the German fortifications around the Palace. In the buildings which had been German headquarters, they found chairs, marble statues and rolled-up paintings from the Palace. They found other furniture and objects as far away as Riga, Tallinn, and in Konigsberg, in Germany. Some precious objects from Pavlovsk left Russia even before the war. Four Gobelins tapestries from Pavlovsk were sold by the Soviet Government to [[J. Paul Getty]], and are now on display in the [[Getty Museum]] in [[Malibu, California]].<ref name=m310>Massie, p. 310</ref>\n\nThe restorers used only the original variants of the architectural decoration; those created by Cameron, Brenna, Voronykhin, and Rossi. The only changes permitted were to use modern materials. Columns made of wood were replaced by poured concrete or bricks, and the ceilings of the Italian and Greek Halls were made of steel and concrete so they would be fireproof. A special school, the Mukhina Leningrad Higher Artistic Industry School, was created in Leningrad to teach the arts of restoring architectural details, furniture, and art objects. This school produced a corps of restoration experts who worked on all the palaces around Leningrad. The work was meticulous and difficult, and proceeded very slowly. \n\nIn 1950, after six years of planting new trees, parts of the park opened to the public. In 1955, the restoration of the facade of the Palace was completed, and restoration of the interiors began. Fortunately for the restorers, the original plans by Cameron, Brenna, Voronykhin and Rossi still existed. Also, fragments of the original interior molding, cornices, friezes and the frames for the carvings, bas-reliefs, medallions and paintings still remained, and could be copied. In addition, there were 2500 photographic negatives taken in the early century by Benois, and another eleven thousand photographs taken just before the war.<ref name=m310/>\n\nThe chief of the restoration, Feodor Oleinik, was insistent that all the restoration be faithful to the original work: \"Pay attention and do not use later details\", he demanded. \"Only the original variant, only that done by Cameron, Brenna, Vornykhin, or Rossi.\" Old techniques of artisans of the 18th century, such as painting false marble and gilding furniture, had to be relearned and applied. A silk workshop was opened in Moscow to recreate the original woven fabrics for wall coverings and upholstery, copying the texture, color and thread counts of the originals. In forty rooms of the Palace, painted decoration on the walls and ceilings had to be precisely recreated in the original colors and designs. A Master painter and six helpers recreated the original ''trompe l'oeil'' ceilings and wall paintings.<ref>Massie, p. 316</ref>\n\nOnce the interior walls and decoration had been exactly recreated, the next step was the furnishings. The twelve thousand pieces of furniture and art objects removed from their original places, from paintings and tapestries to water pitchers and glasses, had to be put back where they belonged. Furniture, doors, and parquet floors of many different colors of wood which had been burned or stolen were remade exactly like the originals. The crystal chandeliers of the 18th century were exactly copied. In 1957, thirteen years after the Palace had been burned, the first seven rooms were opened to the public.<ref>Massie, p. 348</ref> \n\nIn 1958, four more rooms were opened, and eleven more in 1960. The Egyptian Vestibule was finished in 1963, and the Italian Room opened in 1965. Eleven more rooms were ready by 1967. By 1977, on the 200th anniversary of the beginning of the Palace, fifty rooms were finished, and the Palace looked again as it had in the time of Maria Feodorovna.<ref>Massie, p. 348</ref>\n\n==Pavlovsk Park==\n{{main|Pavlovsk Park}}\n[[File:PavlovskPalace temple.jpg|thumb|right|The Temple of Friendship in Pavlovsk Park (1780)]]\n[[File:Palace-p1030791.jpg|thumb|right|The private garden of Maria Feodorovna. The windows of her private apartment overlooking the garden are visible in the background.]]\n[[File:Slavyanka River autumn.JPG|thumb|right|The Slavyanka River in Pavlovsk Park in autumn]]\nPavlovsk Park was conceived by Cameron as a classic [[English landscape garden]], an idealized landscape filled with picturesque pieces of classical architecture, designed to surprise and please the viewer. Like the English landscape garden, it took much of its inspiration from the romanticized landscape paintings of [[Claude Lorraine]] and [[Hubert Robert]]. The gallery of Pavlovsk has twelve landscape paintings by Hubert Robert that were commissioned by Maria Feodorovna. Cameron laid out a triple alley of five straight rows of [[Linden tree]]s, imported from [[L\u00fcbeck]], in a long axis from the courtyard of the Palace, leading to a small semi-circular place in the forest. This served as a parade ground for Emperor Pavel's Imperial guards. In the forest to the left of this axis he placed a romantic thatch-roofed dairy with stalls for two cows modeled after the one in the park of [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] where Maria Feodorovna had grown up; and on the other side of the parade route, an aviary, filled with parakeets, nightingales, starlings, and quail. This part of the garden also included a [[labyrinth]], and picturesque tombstones imported from Italy. An early French visitor described the effect of this part of the garden: \"Melancholy consumes the soul when you arrive...then the pain is followed by pleasure.\"<ref>Saint-Maure, E., ''Anthologie russe'', Paris, 1823 p. 247.</ref>\n\nMarie Feodorovna was deeply interested in botany. In 1801, Cameron constructed an elegant flower garden behind the Palace, just outside the windows of the private apartment of Marie Feodorovna. Next to the garden was a Greek temple containing a statue of the [[Charites|Three Graces]], looking down at the river. She imported flowers from Holland for her garden, including [[hyacinth (plant)|hyacinth]], [[tulips]], [[daffodils]] and [[Narcissus (plant)|narcissus]]. She also constructed an [[orangery]] and several [[greenhouse]]s where she grew apricots, cherries, peaches, grapes and pineapples. The River Slavyanovka was the picturesque axis of the composition, with winding paths along the river providing changing views to the visitor. A dam turned the river into a picturesque pond in the valley below the Palace. In 1780, Cameron constructed a large Roman temple at a turn in the river in the bottom of the valley. The classical temple, similar to the Temple of Pan in the gardens at [[Stowe House]] in England. It was originally called the Temple of Gratitude, dedicated to Catherine the Great, who had donated the land for the Park, but in 1780 it was renamed the Temple of Friendship, in honor of the visit to Pavlovsk of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]].<ref>Orloff and Chvidkovsky, p. 298</ref>\n\nBetween 1780 and 1783, at the top of the hill which descended to the lake, Cameron constructed a colonnade with a copy of the [[Apollo Belvedere]] in Rome.<ref>Orloff and Chvidkovsky, p. 296</ref> By the early 19th century, the park at Pavlovsk had gardens representing many different styles. A formal and geometric [[garden \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise]] was planted near the Palace. An Italian garden, with parterres, classical statues and a grand staircase was created by Brenna on the hillside overlooking the lake. Cameron used the intimate Dutch style for the little private garden outside Maria Feodorovna's private apartments, and the huge park was in the style of the English and French landscape garden. An English visitor, John Lowden, who saw Pavlovsk during the war against Napoleon in 1812, wrote that Pavlovsk Park was the most beautiful example of the English landscape garden in all of the Russian Empire.<ref>Lowden, John, ''The Encyclopedia of Gardening'', London, 1827, p. 26.</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1792, the chief architect of the Pavlovsk Park was the Italian landscape architect and painter, Pietro Gonzaga, who had begun his career as a set designer at the [[La Scala]] Theater in Milan. Gonzaga always remained a theater designer; he designed the funeral procession of Catherine the Great, Paul I, and Alexander I. as well as the Coronations of Paul I, Alexander I and Nicholas I. For Cameron he painted landscape scenes of the Pavlovsk Park on the walls and ceilings of rooms of the Palace, and he designed spectacular sets for the 1814 ceremony at Pavlovsk welcoming Alexander I home after his victory over Napoleon.<ref name=m310/>\n\nGonzaga planned the landscape of Pavlovsk Park with meticulous care, marking the trees to be saved or cut down. He laid out paths and changed contours to create the effects he wanted, using open and closed spaces and different colors and shapes of trees to make theatrical scenes. He made dramatic use of the contrast between the white bark and light leaves of birch trees and the dark needles of red-brown trunks of pine trees, setting groups of birch trees in front of dark backgrounds of pines. He made decorative use of the different seasons in the park, painting scenes with brilliant colors of the autumn leaves. Gonzaga was the architect of Pavlovsk Park until his death in 1831 at the age of eighty.<ref>Massie, p. 92</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Orloff, Alexandre and Chvidkovski, Dimitri, ''Saint-Petersbourg- l'architecture des tsars'', Editions Place des Victoires, Paris 1995, translated from Russian to French by Brigitte de Monclos, {{ISBN|2-84459-025-X}}\n*Massie, Suzanne, ''Pavlovsk: The Life of a Russian Palace'', Hodder & Stoughton, 1990; {{ISBN|0-340-48790-9}}.\n\n==Gallery of Pavlovsk Palace and Park==\n<gallery perrow=\"3\" widths=\"220px\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Pavlovsk100.jpg|Pavlovsk Palace\nFile:Pavlovsk palace 1808.jpg|Approach to Pavlovsk Palace (1808)\nFile:Palace-church-p1030783.jpg|The chapel of Pavlovsk Palace\nFile:Pavlovsk park1025.jpg|The Rossi Pavilion in Pavlovsk Park\nFile:Cast-iron Bridge.JPG|The cast iron bridge in Pavlovsk Park\nFile:Autumn and yellow birch and still river Pavlovsk.jpg|The Slavyanka River in Pavlovsk Park in autumn\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{official website|http://www.pavlovskmuseum.ru}}\n* [http://www.alexanderpalace.org/pavlovsk/ History, description and pictures of the different rooms]\n* [http://tour-planet.com/articles/16 Description of the attractions of the palace and photos, traveler reviews, useful information for tourists]\n* {{YouTube|R7jMaqmK2Qc|A film made in 1977 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the palace}}\n\n{{Imperial palaces in Russia}}\n{{coord|59|41|9|N|30|27|12|E|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Palaces in Russia]]\n[[Category:Royal residences in Russia]]\n[[Category:World Heritage Sites in Russia]]\n[[Category:Palaces in Saint Petersburg]]\n[[Category:Charles Cameron buildings]]\n[[Category:Palladian architecture]]\n[[Category:Neoclassical architecture in Russia]]\n[[Category:Historic house museums in Saint Petersburg]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Pavlovsky Palace 03.jpg|right|thumb|Pavlovsk Palace]]\n[[File:Palace-Pablovsk-p1030748.jpg|right|thumb|Courtyard of Pavlovsk Palace]]\n[[File:Palace-p1030762.jpg|thumb|right|Greek Hall of Pavlovsk Palace]]\n[[File:Palace-p1030750.jpg|thumb|right|Italian Hall of Pavlovsk Palace]]\n[[File:PavlovskPalace bedroom.jpg|right|thumb|State Bedroom of Pavlovsk Palace]]\n[[File:PavlovskPalace dining.jpg|thumb|right|Dining room of Pavlovsk Palace]]\n[[File:Palace-p1030759.jpg|thumb|right|The library of Paul I]]\n[[File:Palace-table-p1030767.jpg|thumb|right|The cabinet of Maria Feodorovna]]\n[[File:Palace-p1030768.jpg|thumb|right|Cabinet of Maria Feodorovna]]\n[[File:Palace-p1030781.jpg|thumb|right|Pavlovsk Palace interior]]\n[[File:Palace-p1030780.jpg|thumb|right|Throne room]]\n\n{{moresources|date=June 2018}}\n{{copypaste|date=June 2018}}\n'''Pavlovsk Palace''' ({{lang-ru|\u041f\u0430\u0432\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0446}}) is an 18th-century Russian Imperial residence built by the order of [[Catherine the Great]] for her son, [[Paul I of Russia|Grand Duke Paul]], in [[Pavlovsk, Saint Petersburg|Pavlovsk]], within [[Saint Petersburg]]. After his death, it became the home of his widow, [[Maria Feodorovna (Sophie Dorothea of W\u00fcrttemberg)|Maria Feodorovna]]. The palace and the large [[English garden]] surrounding it are now a Russian state museum and public park.\n\n==Creation==\nIn 1777, the Empress [[Catherine II of Russia]] gave a parcel of a thousand hectares of forest along the winding [[Slavyanka River]], four kilometers from her residence at Tsarskoye Selo, to her son and heir Paul I and his wife [[Maria Feodorovna (Sophie Dorothea of W\u00fcrttemberg)|Maria Feodorovna]], to celebrate the birth of their first son, the future [[Alexander I of Russia]]. At the time the land was given to Paul and Maria Feodorovna, there were two rustic log lodges called ''Krik'' and ''Krak''. Paul and his wife spent the summers of 1777 to 1780 in Krik, while their new homes and the garden were being built.<ref>Massie, p. 15</ref>\n\nThey began by building two wooden buildings, one kilometer apart. Paul's house, a two-story house in the Dutch style, with small gardens, was called \"Marienthal\", or the \"Valley of Maria\". Maria's house was a small wooden house with a cupola and flower beds, named \"Paullust\", or \"Paul's Joy\". Paul and Maria Feodorovna began to create picturesque \"ruins\", a Chinese kiosk, Chinese bridges and classical temples in the [[English landscape garden]] style which had spread rapidly across Europe in the second half of the 18th century.<ref>Orloff and Chvidkovsky, p. 289</ref> \n\nIn 1780, Catherine the Great loaned her official architect, the Scotsman [[Charles Cameron (architect)|Charles Cameron]], to design a palace on a hillside overlooking the Slavyanka River, near the site of Marienthal. Cameron had studied under English architect [[Isaac Ware]], who was close to [[William Kent]]. Kent introduced the [[Palladian]] style of architecture into England with his work at [[Chiswick House]] for [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Lord Burlington]]. Through this connection Cameron became familiar with the original plans of Palladio, which were in the personal collection of Lord Burlington. This style was the major influence on Cameron when he designed Pavlovsk.<ref>Orloff and Chvidkovsky, p. 290</ref>\n\nCameron began his project not with the palace itself but with two classical pavilions. The first was the Temple of Friendship, a circular [[Dorians|Dorian]] temple with sixteen columns supporting a low dome, containing a statue of Catherine the Great. It was placed at a bend of the Slavyanka River, below the future palace, and was surrounded by silver poplars and transplanted Siberian pines. The second was the Apollo Colonnade, a double row of columns with an entablature, forming a setting for a reproduction of the Belvedere Apollo. It was placed at the entrance of the park, and it was made of porous limestone with a coarse finish; the surfaces suggest that they had been aged by centuries of weather. At the same time the Slavyanka River was dammed, to create a lake which would mirror the facade of the palace above.<ref>Massie, p. 20</ref>\n\nMaria Feodorovna also insisted in having several rustic structures which recalled the palace where she grew up at \u00c9tupes, forty miles from [[Basel]], in what was then the Duchy of [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] and today is in ''Alsace''. Cameron constructed a small Swiss chalet with a library; a dairy of rough stones with a thatched roof, where milk products were kept and prepared, and an [[aviary]] in the form of a small classical temple with metal netting between the Dorian columns, which was filled with [[nightingale]]s, [[European goldfinch|goldfinch]], [[starling]]s and [[quail]]. For the palace itself, Cameron conceived a country house which seems to have been based on a design of [[Andrea Palladio]] shown in a woodcut in his book ''[[I quattro libri dell'architettura]]'', for the [[Villa Capra \"La Rotonda\"]] near Vicenza in Italy. This same drawing was later used by [[Thomas Jefferson]] in his design for the [[University of Virginia]]. The palace he designed had a cube-shaped central block three stories high with a low dome supported by sixty-four columns. On either side of the building were two single story colonnades of curved open winged galleries connected to service buildings one and a half stories high. Each facade of the palace was decorated with molded friezes and reliefs.<ref>Massie, p. 22.</ref>\n\nIn September 1781, as construction of the Pavlovsk Palace began, Paul and Maria set off on a journey to Austria, Italy, France and Germany. They traveled under the incognito of \"The Count and Countess of the North\". During their travels they saw the palaces and French gardens of Versailles and Chantilly, which strongly influenced the future appearance of Pavlovsk Park. [[King Louis XVI]] presented them with four [[Gobelin tapestry|Gobelin tapestries]], Marie Antoinette presented Maria Feodorovna with a sixty-piece toilet set of S\u00e8vres porcelain, and they ordered more sets of porcelain and purchased statues, busts, paintings, furniture and paintings, all for Pavlovsk. While they traveled, they kept in contact almost daily with Kuchelbecker, the supervisor of construction at Pavlovsk, sending back and forth drawings, plans and notes on the smallest details.<ref name=m32>Massie, p. 32</ref>\n\nPaul and Maria Feodorovna returned in November 1782, and they continued to fill Pavlovsk with art objects. A shipment of antique marbles, statues, busts, urns, and pottery discovered and purchased at [[Pompei]], arrived in 1783. Sixteen sets of furniture, over two hundred pieces, were ordered from Paris between 1783-85 for the State Rooms. In 1784, twelve Hubert Robert landscapes were commissioned for Pavlovsk. The couple purchased ninety-six clocks from Europe. The Imperial Glass factory, made special chandeliers for each room. In the midst of the construction, tensions grew between them and Cameron. Cameron was used to the unlimited budget for materials given him by Catherine the Great, while Catherine gave very little money to Paul; and Cameron was annoyed by the furniture, tapestries and fireplaces brought back from Europe by Maria Feodorovna without consulting him. Maria Feodorovna in turn was annoyed by the bright polychrome decoration and Pompeian arabesques used by Cameron, and wanted more delicate colors, and Paul did not like anything that resembled the style of his mother's house, the Catherine Palace at Tsarskoye Selo.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nThe tensions led to a parting in 1786. Cameron left to build a new palace for Catherine in the Crimea. He had finished entry vestibule and the five rooms of the private apartments. The work of decorating the interior was taken over by an Italian architect, [[Vincenzo Brenna]], from Florence, who had come to Russia in 1783. Brenna designed interiors which reflected Paul's taste for Roman classicism. He created the white and gold Halls of War and Peace, on either side of the Greek Hall by Cameron, which had a colonnade of green false marble columns, resembling a Greek temple. He made the Italian hall into a replica of a Roman temple, and he built the State Bedroom for Maria Feodorovna as an imitation of the state bedroom of the King of France, with a huge gilded bed, and cream silk wallpaper painted in tempura with colorful flowers, fruit, musical instruments and gardening tools.<ref name=m32/>\n\nCatherine the Great died in 1796, and Paul became Emperor. He decided to enlarge Pavlovsk into a palace suitable for a royal residence, adding two new wings on either side of the main building, and a church attached to the south wing. Between 1797 and 1799, he lavished money and the finest materials on Brenna's interiors. The reign of Emperor Paul did not last long. He alienated the nobles, and became increasingly fearful of conspiracies. His fears were justified; the Emperor Paul was murdered by members of his court in 1801, and his son Alexander became Emperor. Pavlovsk Palace became the residence of the Empress Maria Feodorovna (1759\u20131828), the mother of both Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia]] and Emperor [[Nicholas I of Russia]]. \n\nShe turned the house into a memorial to her murdered husband, filled with his furniture and portraits, and made the house a showcase for finest 18th-century French furnishings, paintings, sculpture and porcelain. Another disaster struck Pavlovsk in 1803; a fire caused by a defective chimney destroyed a major part of the interior of the palace, including all the decor of the State Apartments and living rooms. Most of the furniture was saved, along with some door panels, fireplaces and mirrors, but most of the Palace had to be rebuilt.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nMaria Feodorovna brought Cameron and Brenna's young assistant, the Italian architect [[Carlo Rossi (architect)|Carlo Rossi]], to help restore the Palace. She also employed a Russian architect, Andrei Voronykhin, who had been born a serf, and was trained in decoration and design, who rose to become the architect of Kazan Cathedral in St. Petersburg. Voronykhin was named chief architect of Pavlovsk by Maria Feodorovna. He brought back the architect [[Giacomo Quarenghi|Quarenghi]], who had redecorated five rooms on the main floor, to recreate his work. He remade some of the rooms, such as the Tapestry Room and the State Bedroom, exactly as they had been, but for other rooms he added decoration inspired by Roman models discovered at Pompeii and Herculaneum; Roman-style lamps, furniture, Roman couches, and chairs copied after those of Roman senators. \n\nFollowing the French taste of the time for Egyptian art, he added black Egyptian statues in the entry vestibule of the Palace, He  redesigned the Greek and Italian halls, replacing the molding on the walls with false marble, and he added a Russian touch; fireplaces faced with Russian [[lapis-lazuli]] and [[jasper]], which had originally been in the Mikhailovsky Palace that Paul had built in St. Petersburg. Voronykhin also made plans for a semi-circular library in one of the wings, which was later built by Carlo Rossi, and he redesigned the private apartments of Maria Feodorovna on the ground floor, which included a library, boudoir and bedroom. He installed French doors and large windows in the apartment, so the [[flower garden]] outside seemed to be part of the interior.<ref>Massie, p. 70</ref>\n\nIn 1805 Voronykhin built the Centaur bridge in the park, and the Visconti bridge, which crossed the Slavyanka at a point it was filled with water lilies. His last construction in the park was the Rose Pavilion, built in 1811, a simple structure surrounded entirely by rosebushes. The Rose Pavilion was the site of a grand fete on 12 July 1814, celebrating the return of Alexander I to St. Petersburg after the defeat of Napoleon. For the occasion, architect Pietro de Gottardo Gonzaga built a ballroom the size of the Rose Pavilion itself in just seventeen days, and surrounded it with huge canvases of Russian villagers celebrating the victory. The ball inside the pavilion opened with a Polonaise led by Alexander and his mother, and ended with a huge display of fireworks. In her later years Maria Feodorovna had a literary salon at Pavlovsk, which was frequented by poet [[Vasily Zhukovsky]], fabulist [[Ivan Krylov]], and historian [[Nikolai Karamzin]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nThe last great St. Petersburg architect to work at Pavlovsk was Carlo Rossi, who in 1824 designed the library, which contained more than twenty thousand books as well as collections of rare coins and butterflies. He also designed the Corner Salon, where Maria Feodorovna received guests such as the first American Ambassador to Russia, [[John Quincy Adams]], and the Lavender Room, whose walls were made of lilac-colored false marble, matching the lilac flowers outside the windows. These rooms were furnished with furniture made of native Russian woods, including Karelian birch, poplar and walnut.<ref>Massie, p. 99</ref>\n\nMaria Feodorovna died on 24 October 1828, fourteen days after her sixty-seventh birthday. She left the house to her younger son, Michael, and specified that none of the furniture should be taken away. After Michael's death, it went to the second son of Nicholas I, Konstantine Nikolayevich. It then passed to his widow and then their eldest son, Konstantine Konstantinovich. Her descendants respected the will, and turned the house into a family museum, just as it was when she died.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n==After the Russian Revolution==\nAt the time of the Russian Revolution in 1917, the eldest son of Constantine Constantinovich, Prince [[Ioann Konstantinovich of Russia]], along with his wife, [[Princess Helen of Serbia]], the daughter of King [[Peter I of Serbia]], were living in one of the wings of Pavlovsk, together with his aunt [[Queen Olga of Greece]]. As the political situation deteriorated, they left, and the house was left to the care of Alexander Polovotsoff, director of the Art Institute and the Museum of Applied Arts in St. Petersburg. \n\nWhen Lenin and the Bolsheviks seized power in November 1917, Polovtsoff went to the Winter Palace, found [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]], the Commissar of Enlightenment of the new government, and demanded that Pavlovsk be saved as a museum. Lunacharsky agreed and named him Commissar Curator of Pavlovsk. He returned to the Palace and found that a group of revolutionary sailors had searched the Palace for weapons and taken a few sabers, but otherwise everything was in its place. He hired former soldiers to guard the house, put all the furniture into the main building, made an inventory of all the treasures in the Palace, and successfully resisted demands from various revolutionary committees for dishes, chairs, tables, and all the books from the library. He was able to persuade Lunacharsky himself to come to Pavlovsk.\n\nAfter Lunacharsky's visit, Pavlovsk was officially confiscated, but turned into a museum, open to the public two or three days a week. Having succeeded in saving the Palace, Polovtsoff took family and belongings and slipped across the border to Finland and moved to Paris.<ref>Polovtsoff, Alexander, Les Tresors d'Art en Russie sous le regime Bolsheviste, Paris, P. Pavlovsky and Co., 1919. Cited in Massie.</ref>\n\n==World War II==\n{{one source|section|date=February 2017}}\nThe German attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941 and the swiftness of the German advance took the Soviet government by surprise. The morning after the attack, the curators of Pavlovsk, under the direction of museum curator Anatoliy Kuchumov, began to pack as many of art objects as possible, starting with the S\u00e8vres porcelain toilet set given by Louis XVI to Maria Feodorovna and Paul in 1780. Ninety-six hours after the announcement of the beginning of the war, the first thirty-four crates were being carried from the palace by horse-drawn cart. Boards were put over the windows, and sand on the floor of the Palace. Thirty curators often worked by candlelight, and by July there were air raids. The paintings, chandeliers, crystal, porcelain, rare furniture, and works of ivory and amber were packed and sent first. They worked with great care \u2013 each piece of furniture had to be carefully dismantled, porcelain vases had to be separated from the bases, and delicate clocks had to have their casing and mechanisms separated and packed separately, with diagrams on how to put them back together. One piece of each set of furniture was saved, and the others left behind. The Roman and Greek antiquities were too heavy and delicate to move, so they were taken to the basements, placed as close together as possible, and then hidden by a brick wall.{{cn|date=August 2018}}\n\nBy the third week of August thirteen thousand objects, plus all the documentation, had been packed and sent away. Some crates were sent to Gorky, others to Sarapul, and the last group, on 20 August 1941, went to Leningrad, where the crates were stored in the basement of [[St Isaac's Cathedral]]. The last shipment included the chandelier from the Italian Hall and the jasper vases from the Greek Hall. On 30 August, the last rail link from Leningrad to Moscow was cut, and the city was under blockade. By 28 August, the Germans were fifty kilometers from Pavlovsk. A Soviet division headquarters was located in one wing of the palace. As the Germans approached, the park and palace came under bombardment. The museum staff began to bury the statues which were too heavy to evacuate. They calculated that the Germans would not dig deeper than one meter eighty centimeters, so they buried all the statues as deep as three meters. The statues of the Three Graces were buried three meters beneath the private garden of Maria Feodorovna. Their calculations were correct; the statues were still there after the war.<ref name=\"Massie, p. 273\">Massie, p. 273</ref> \n\nOn 16 September, the last soldiers left, and the Germans took over Pavlovsk Palace, still occupied by a group of elderly women guardians. The Germans occupied Pavlovsk palace for two and a half years. Officers were quartered in the salons on the first floor, and the ballroom was made into a garage for cars and motorcycles. Barracks were located in the north wing and a hospital in the south wing. German soldiers, Dutch soldiers and Spanish soldiers in special units of the German army occupied the buildings in the park. The sculpture and furniture that remained in the house and all the books of the Rossi Library were taken to Germany. The statue of Emperor Paul in the courtyard was used as a telephone pole. The Germans did not discover the antiquities hidden behind the brick wall in the basement.<ref name=\"Massie, p. 273\">Massie, p. 273</ref>\n\nPavlovsk was retaken, ironically, Zhdhanov, Zhdhanokshchina, and Stalin's Purges in 1917-1953, did as much psychological Damage as the Siege, on before, on and after, on 24 January 1944. When the Soviet troops arrived, the palace had already been burning for three days. The main building of the Palace was a hollow shell, without a roof or floors. The north wall had fallen. Most of the parquet floors of the palace had been used as firewood; a few pieces were found in unburned portions of the palace near the stoves. Of the more than 100,000 trees that had been in the park before the War, at least 70 percent had been cut down or destroyed by shelling. All the decorative bridges in the park had been blown up. Eight hundred bunkers had been dug in the park. The Rose Pavilion was gone; the Germans had used the materials to construct a fortified dugout.<ref name=\"Massie, p. 273\"/>\n\n==Restoration==\n{{refimprove section|date=February 2017}}\nOn 18 February 1944, a meeting was held at the House of Architects in Leningrad to discuss the fate of the ruined Palaces. Academician and architect Aleksei Shchusev, who had designed the Lenin Mausoleum, called for the immediate reconstruction of the Palaces. \"If we do not do this\", he said, \"we who know and remember these palaces in all their glory as they were, then the next generation will never be able to reconstruct them.\"<ref>Massie, p. 279</ref> \n\nEven before the war had ended, the Soviet government decided to restore Pavlovsk and the other ruined palaces around Leningrad. First the mines had to be cleared from the ruins and palace and the park. Then the remaining walls were supported with scaffolding, and casts were made of the remaining molding. Fragments of plaster molding were collected, sorting, and casts made. The color of paint still on the remaining walls was carefully noted for later copying. Photographs and early plans of the palace were brought together to help with the restoration.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nAs soon as the war ended, a search began for treasures stolen from the Palace. Curators collected pieces of furniture, fabric, the legs of tables and pieces of doors and gilded cornices from the German fortifications around the Palace. In the buildings which had been German headquarters, they found chairs, marble statues and rolled-up paintings from the Palace. They found other furniture and objects as far away as Riga, Tallinn, and in Konigsberg, in Germany. Some precious objects from Pavlovsk left Russia even before the war. Four Gobelins tapestries from Pavlovsk were sold by the Soviet Government to [[J. Paul Getty]], and are now on display in the [[Getty Museum]] in [[Malibu, California]].<ref name=m310>Massie, p. 310</ref>\n\nThe restorers used only the original variants of the architectural decoration; those created by Cameron, Brenna, Voronykhin, and Rossi. The only changes permitted were to use modern materials. Columns made of wood were replaced by poured concrete or bricks, and the ceilings of the Italian and Greek Halls were made of steel and concrete so they would be fireproof. A special school, the Mukhina Leningrad Higher Artistic Industry School, was created in Leningrad to teach the arts of restoring architectural details, furniture, and art objects. This school produced a corps of restoration experts who worked on all the palaces around Leningrad. The work was meticulous and difficult, and proceeded very slowly. \n\nIn 1950, after six years of planting new trees, parts of the park opened to the public. In 1955, the restoration of the facade of the Palace was completed, and restoration of the interiors began. Fortunately for the restorers, the original plans by Cameron, Brenna, Voronykhin and Rossi still existed. Also, fragments of the original interior molding, cornices, friezes and the frames for the carvings, bas-reliefs, medallions and paintings still remained, and could be copied. In addition, there were 2500 photographic negatives taken in the early century by Benois, and another eleven thousand photographs taken just before the war.<ref name=m310/>\n\nThe chief of the restoration, Feodor Oleinik, was insistent that all the restoration be faithful to the original work: \"Pay attention and do not use later details\", he demanded. \"Only the original variant, only that done by Cameron, Brenna, Vornykhin, or Rossi.\" Old techniques of artisans of the 18th century, such as painting false marble and gilding furniture, had to be relearned and applied. A silk workshop was opened in Moscow to recreate the original woven fabrics for wall coverings and upholstery, copying the texture, color and thread counts of the originals. In forty rooms of the Palace, painted decoration on the walls and ceilings had to be precisely recreated in the original colors and designs. A Master painter and six helpers recreated the original ''trompe l'oeil'' ceilings and wall paintings.<ref>Massie, p. 316</ref>\n\nOnce the interior walls and decoration had been exactly recreated, the next step was the furnishings. The twelve thousand pieces of furniture and art objects removed from their original places, from paintings and tapestries to water pitchers and glasses, had to be put back where they belonged. Furniture, doors, and parquet floors of many different colors of wood which had been burned or stolen were remade exactly like the originals. The crystal chandeliers of the 18th century were exactly copied. In 1957, thirteen years after the Palace had been burned, the first seven rooms were opened to the public.<ref>Massie, p. 348</ref> \n\nIn 1958, four more rooms were opened, and eleven more in 1960. The Egyptian Vestibule was finished in 1963, and the Italian Room opened in 1965. Eleven more rooms were ready by 1967. By 1977, on the 200th anniversary of the beginning of the Palace, fifty rooms were finished, and the Palace looked again as it had in the time of Maria Feodorovna.<ref>Massie, p. 348</ref>\n\n==Pavlovsk Park==\n{{main|Pavlovsk Park}}\n[[File:PavlovskPalace temple.jpg|thumb|right|The Temple of Friendship in Pavlovsk Park (1780)]]\n[[File:Palace-p1030791.jpg|thumb|right|The private garden of Maria Feodorovna. The windows of her private apartment overlooking the garden are visible in the background.]]\n[[File:Slavyanka River autumn.JPG|thumb|right|The Slavyanka River in Pavlovsk Park in autumn]]\nPavlovsk Park was conceived by Cameron as a classic [[English landscape garden]], an idealized landscape filled with picturesque pieces of classical architecture, designed to surprise and please the viewer. Like the English landscape garden, it took much of its inspiration from the romanticized landscape paintings of [[Claude Lorraine]] and [[Hubert Robert]]. The gallery of Pavlovsk has twelve landscape paintings by Hubert Robert that were commissioned by Maria Feodorovna. Cameron laid out a triple alley of five straight rows of [[Linden tree]]s, imported from [[L\u00fcbeck]], in a long axis from the courtyard of the Palace, leading to a small semi-circular place in the forest. This served as a parade ground for Emperor Pavel's Imperial guards. In the forest to the left of this axis he placed a romantic thatch-roofed dairy with stalls for two cows modeled after the one in the park of [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] where Maria Feodorovna had grown up; and on the other side of the parade route, an aviary, filled with parakeets, nightingales, starlings, and quail. This part of the garden also included a [[labyrinth]], and picturesque tombstones imported from Italy. An early French visitor described the effect of this part of the garden: \"Melancholy consumes the soul when you arrive...then the pain is followed by pleasure.\"<ref>Saint-Maure, E., ''Anthologie russe'', Paris, 1823 p. 247.</ref>\n\nMarie Feodorovna was deeply interested in botany. In 1801, Cameron constructed an elegant flower garden behind the Palace, just outside the windows of the private apartment of Marie Feodorovna. Next to the garden was a Greek temple containing a statue of the [[Charites|Three Graces]], looking down at the river. She imported flowers from Holland for her garden, including [[hyacinth (plant)|hyacinth]], [[tulips]], [[daffodils]] and [[Narcissus (plant)|narcissus]]. She also constructed an [[orangery]] and several [[greenhouse]]s where she grew apricots, cherries, peaches, grapes and pineapples. The River Slavyanovka was the picturesque axis of the composition, with winding paths along the river providing changing views to the visitor. A dam turned the river into a picturesque pond in the valley below the Palace. In 1780, Cameron constructed a large Roman temple at a turn in the river in the bottom of the valley. The classical temple, similar to the Temple of Pan in the gardens at [[Stowe House]] in England. It was originally called the Temple of Gratitude, dedicated to Catherine the Great, who had donated the land for the Park, but in 1780 it was renamed the Temple of Friendship, in honor of the visit to Pavlovsk of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]].<ref>Orloff and Chvidkovsky, p. 298</ref>\n\nBetween 1780 and 1783, at the top of the hill which descended to the lake, Cameron constructed a colonnade with a copy of the [[Apollo Belvedere]] in Rome.<ref>Orloff and Chvidkovsky, p. 296</ref> By the early 19th century, the park at Pavlovsk had gardens representing many different styles. A formal and geometric [[garden \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise]] was planted near the Palace. An Italian garden, with parterres, classical statues and a grand staircase was created by Brenna on the hillside overlooking the lake. Cameron used the intimate Dutch style for the little private garden outside Maria Feodorovna's private apartments, and the huge park was in the style of the English and French landscape garden. An English visitor, John Lowden, who saw Pavlovsk during the war against Napoleon in 1812, wrote that Pavlovsk Park was the most beautiful example of the English landscape garden in all of the Russian Empire.<ref>Lowden, John, ''The Encyclopedia of Gardening'', London, 1827, p. 26.</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1792, the chief architect of the Pavlovsk Park was the Italian landscape architect and painter, Pietro Gonzaga, who had begun his career as a set designer at the [[La Scala]] Theater in Milan. Gonzaga always remained a theater designer; he designed the funeral procession of Catherine the Great, Paul I, and Alexander I. as well as the Coronations of Paul I, Alexander I and Nicholas I. For Cameron he painted landscape scenes of the Pavlovsk Park on the walls and ceilings of rooms of the Palace, and he designed spectacular sets for the 1814 ceremony at Pavlovsk welcoming Alexander I home after his victory over Napoleon.<ref name=m310/>\n\nGonzaga planned the landscape of Pavlovsk Park with meticulous care, marking the trees to be saved or cut down. He laid out paths and changed contours to create the effects he wanted, using open and closed spaces and different colors and shapes of trees to make theatrical scenes. He made dramatic use of the contrast between the white bark and light leaves of birch trees and the dark needles of red-brown trunks of pine trees, setting groups of birch trees in front of dark backgrounds of pines. He made decorative use of the different seasons in the park, painting scenes with brilliant colors of the autumn leaves. Gonzaga was the architect of Pavlovsk Park until his death in 1831 at the age of eighty.<ref>Massie, p. 92</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Orloff, Alexandre and Chvidkovski, Dimitri, ''Saint-Petersbourg- l'architecture des tsars'', Editions Place des Victoires, Paris 1995, translated from Russian to French by Brigitte de Monclos, {{ISBN|2-84459-025-X}}\n*Massie, Suzanne, ''Pavlovsk: The Life of a Russian Palace'', Hodder & Stoughton, 1990; {{ISBN|0-340-48790-9}}.\n\n==Gallery of Pavlovsk Palace and Park==\n<gallery perrow=\"3\" widths=\"220px\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Pavlovsk100.jpg|Pavlovsk Palace\nFile:Pavlovsk palace 1808.jpg|Approach to Pavlovsk Palace (1808)\nFile:Palace-church-p1030783.jpg|The chapel of Pavlovsk Palace\nFile:Pavlovsk park1025.jpg|The Rossi Pavilion in Pavlovsk Park\nFile:Cast-iron Bridge.JPG|The cast iron bridge in Pavlovsk Park\nFile:Autumn and yellow birch and still river Pavlovsk.jpg|The Slavyanka River in Pavlovsk Park in autumn\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{official website|http://www.pavlovskmuseum.ru}}\n* [http://www.alexanderpalace.org/pavlovsk/ History, description and pictures of the different rooms]\n* [http://tour-planet.com/articles/16 Description of the attractions of the palace and photos, traveler reviews, useful information for tourists]\n* {{YouTube|R7jMaqmK2Qc|A film made in 1977 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the palace}}\n\n{{Imperial palaces in Russia}}\n{{coord|59|41|9|N|30|27|12|E|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Palaces in Russia]]\n[[Category:Royal residences in Russia]]\n[[Category:World Heritage Sites in Russia]]\n[[Category:Palaces in Saint Petersburg]]\n[[Category:Charles Cameron buildings]]\n[[Category:Palladian architecture]]\n[[Category:Neoclassical architecture in Russia]]\n[[Category:Historic house museums in Saint Petersburg]]\n", "name_user": "JSlip", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAfter the Russian Revolution", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavlovsk_Palace"}

He graduated from the Plovdiv English Language School (ELS).<ref>[http://www.els-plovdiv.com/ Official site of ELS]</ref> He subsequently graduated in Foreign Economic Relations from the [[Moscow State Institute of International Relations]].\n\n==Term in office==\nDespite promises of change, the stagnation that had characterized the entire post-communist period since 1989 persisted during Videnov's term, as did the shady privatization schemes, the underfunding of social services, government inaction against [[Bulgarian mafia|organized crime groups]] such as [[VIS (criminal organisation)|VIS-2]], [[Security Insurance Company|SIC]] and [[Multigroup]], alleged government patronizing of dingy business groups (such as the so-called \"Orion friend circle\") and the emigration of young and educated Bulgarians. Despite this, the BSP still had popular support for a time, as it was able to win the local elections in 1995. One significant initiative was the government's launching of a campaign for mass [[privatization]], in which ordinary [[middle-class]] citizens were to acquire shares in the factories and firms that were being de-nationalized.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n==Crisis==\nDuring the second year of Videnov's term, Bulgaria experienced a severe economic crisis and declining quality of living standard. One element of this was the grain crisis. In mid-1996, the first reports appeared that the country's grain reserves were near complete depletion due to excessive exports, and bread did actually become scarce for some time in the winter of 1996\u20131997. At the same time, the postponement of the payment of interest on Bulgaria's foreign debt, which had been negotiated by the [[Filip Dimitrov]] government ([[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|Union of Democratic Forces]], UDF) in 1992, ran out and no further postponement was granted despite Bulgaria's continuing inability to pay. The government also failed to negotiate a loan to relieve the situation. This decreased the country's [[credit rating]] and initiated the destabilization of the finance system. In a short period of time, more than half of Bulgaria's commercial banks went bankrupt, with hundreds of thousands of people losing their savings, while the so-called \"credit millionaires\" profited enormously from the situation because their immense debts to the banks were reduced to nothing. Simultaneously, [[hyperinflation|inflation skyrocketed]], with the [[Bulgarian lev|lev]]'s value plummeting from 70:1 USD in early 1996 to 3,000:1 in early 1997, causing a sharp decline in purchasing power.

Following the results, several chief members of cabinet resigned and joined the internal BSP opposition against the party leader. Videnov tendered his own resignation as both prime minister and chairman of the BSP on 21 December 1996, but stayed on as acting prime minister until a successor could be appointed. The BSP, which still held the majority in Parliament, attempted to form a new cabinet. However, the UDF-headed opposition responded by organizing month-long street protests in big cities, demanding that the parliament should be dissolved and that elections must be held immediately because of the BSP's responsibility for the crisis. The protests culminated in a [[general strike]] and a siege of the house of Parliament, which was stormed and set on fire by the protesters on 10 January 1997.

He graduated from the Plovdiv English Language School (ELS).<ref>[http://www.els-plovdiv.com/ Official site of ELS]</ref> He subsequently graduated in Foreign Economic Relations from the [[Moscow State Institute of International Relations]].\n\n==Term in office==\nDespite promises of change, the stagnation that had characterized the entire post-communist period since 1989 persisted during Videnov's term, as did the shady privatization schemes, the underfunding of social services, government inaction against [[Bulgarian mafia|organized crime groups]] such as [[VIS (criminal organisation)|VIS-2]], [[Security Insurance Company|SIC]] and [[Multigroup]], alleged government patronizing of dingy business groups (such as the so-called \"Orion friend circle\") and the emigration of young and educated Bulgarians. Despite this, the BSP still had popular support for a time, as it was able to win the local elections in 1995. One significant initiative was the government's launching of a campaign for mass [[privatization]], in which ordinary [[middle-class]] citizens were to acquire shares in the factories and firms that were being de-nationalized.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n==Crisis==\nDuring the second year of Videnov's term, Bulgaria experienced a severe economic crisis and declining quality of living standard. One element of this was the grain crisis. In mid-1996, the first reports appeared that the country's grain reserves were near complete depletion due to excessive exports, and bread did actually become scarce for some time in the winter of 1996\u20131997. At the same time, the postponement of the payment of interest on Bulgaria's foreign debt, which had been negotiated by the [[Filip Dimitrov]] government ([[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|Union of Democratic Forces]], UDF) in 1992, ran out and no further postponement was granted despite Bulgaria's continuing inability to pay. The government also failed to negotiate a loan to relieve the situation. This decreased the country's [[credit rating]] and initiated the destabilization of the finance system. In a short period of time, more than half of Bulgaria's commercial banks went bankrupt, with hundreds of thousands of people losing their savings, while the so-called \"credit millionaires\" profited enormously from the situation because their immense debts to the banks were reduced to nothing. Simultaneously, [[hyperinflation|inflation skyrocketed]], with the [[Bulgarian lev|lev]]'s value plummeting from 70:1 USD in early 1996 to 3,000:1 in early 1997, causing a sharp decline in purchasing power.

Following the results, several chief members of cabinet resigned and joined the internal BSP opposition against the party leader. Videnov tendered his own resignation as both prime minister and chairman of the BSP on 21 December 1996, but stayed on as acting prime minister until a successor could be appointed. The BSP, which still held the majority in Parliament, attempted to form a new cabinet. However, the UDF-headed opposition responded by organizing month-long street protests in big cities, demanding that the parliament should be dissolved and that elections must be held immediately because of the BSP's responsibility for the crisis. The protests culminated in a [[general strike]] and a siege of the house of Parliament, which was stormed and set on fire by the protesters on 10 January 1997. Bowing to popular pressure, BSP leaders eventually agreed to early elections and a caretaker cabinet headed by [[Stefan Sofiyanski]] (UDF) took over on 13 February 1997.
