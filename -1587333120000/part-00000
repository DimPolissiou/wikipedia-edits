As such it forms a northerly bypass to [[Chester]] and a shorter route between the North West and [[North Wales]] than the [[A55 road|A55]].  The road is dualled west of the M56. There is roundabout with the [[A540 road|A540]] and at [[Dunkirk, Cheshire|Dunkirk]] at the western terminus of the M56. East of the junction the road is [[single carriageway]] and crosses the [[A41 road|A41]] by way of a roundabout at [[Backford Cross]]. The A5117 intersects the [[M53 motorway|M53]] at Junction 10. This junction is just east of [[Cheshire Oaks Designer Outlet]]. The road then continues almost parallel to the M56, which it intersects at Junction 14, at which there is a [[Motorway service area]].

Some sections were constructed in concrete.  The road was lined for much of its length with poplar trees.  This original tree lined [[boulevard]] layout is still in evidence on the section adjacent to [[Stanlow Refinery]]. In the 1960s it was marked out as a single carriageway 3-lane road.  The middle lane was known as the \"suicide\" lane due to overtaking vehicles from each direction heading towards each other at speed.

The known [[viral envelope|envelope]] [[glycoprotein]]s (gB, gC, gE, gH, gI, gK, gL) correspond with those in HSV; however, there is no equivalent of HSV gD. VZV also fails to produce the LAT (latency-associated transcripts) that play an important role in establishing HSV latency (herpes simplex virus). VZV virons are spherical and 180\u2013200&nbsp;nm in diameter. Their lipid envelope encloses the 100&nbsp;nm nucleocapsid of 162 [[hexameric]] and [[pentameric]] capsomeres arranged in an icosahedral form. Its DNA is a single, linear, double-stranded molecule, 125,000&nbsp;nt long. The capsid is surrounded by loosely associated proteins known collectively as the tegument; many of these proteins play critical roles in initiating the process of virus reproduction in the infected cell. The tegument is in turn covered by a lipid envelope studded with glycoproteins that are displayed on the exterior of the virion, each approximately 8&nbsp;nm long.\n\n==Genomes==\nThe genome was first sequenced in 1986.<ref name=Davison1986>{{cite journal |vauthors=Davison AJ, Scott JE | year = 1986 | title = The complete DNA sequence of varicella-zoster virus |  journal = J Gen Virol | volume = 67 | issue = 9| pages = 1759\u20131816 | doi=10.1099/0022-1317-67-9-1759 | pmid=3018124| doi-access = free }}</ref> It is a linear duplex DNA molecule, a laboratory strain has 124,884 base pairs.

The L segment can also be inverted resulting in a total of four linear isomers (I<sub>L</sub> and I<sub>LS</sub>).  This is distinct from HSV's equiprobable distribution, and the discriminatory mechanism is not known.  A small percentage of isolated molecules are circular genomes, about which little is known.
