[[Log-lin plot]]; a straight line therefore shows an exponential increase.]]\n=== Background ===\nThe concept of copyright developed after the [[printing press]] came into use in Europe<ref name=histpersp/> in the 15th and 16th centuries.<ref>Joanna Kostylo, \"From Gunpowder to Print: The Common Origins of Copyright and Patent\", in Ronan Deazley et al., ''Privilege and Property: Essays on the History of Copyright'' (Cambridge: Open Book, 2010), 21-50; online at books.openedition.org/obp/1062</ref> The printing press made it much cheaper to produce works, but as there was initially no copyright law, anyone could buy or rent a press and print any text. Popular new works were immediately re-[[Typesetting|set]] and re-published by competitors, so printers needed a constant stream of new material. Fees paid to authors for new works were high, and significantly supplemented the incomes of many academics.<ref name=reason/> \n\nPrinting brought [[print culture|profound social changes]]. The rise in [[literacy]] across [[Europe]] led to a dramatic increase in the [[demand]] for reading matter.<ref name=histpersp>''Copyright in Historical Perspective'', p. 136-137, Patterson, 1968, Vanderbilt Univ. Press</ref> Prices of reprints were low, so publications could be bought by poorer people, creating a mass audience.<ref name=reason/> In German language markets before the advent of copyright, technical materials, like popular fiction, were inexpensive and widely available; it has been suggested this contributed to Germany's industrial and economic success.<ref name=reason/>  After copyright law became established (in 1710 in England and Scotland, and in the 1840s in German-speaking areas) the low-price mass market vanished, and fewer, more expensive editions were published; distribution of scientific and technical information was greatly reduced.<ref name=reason>{{cite news |last1=Thadeusz |first1=Frank |title=No Copyright Law: The Real Reason for Germany's Industrial Expansion? |url=https://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/no-copyright-law-the-real-reason-for-germany-s-industrial-expansion-a-710976.html |work=Spiegel Online |date=18 August 2010}}</ref><ref name=world>{{cite journal |last1=Lasar |first1=Matthew |title=Did Weak Copyright Laws Help Germany Outpace The British Empire? |url=https://www.wired.com/2010/08/copyright-germany-britain/ |journal=Wired |date=23 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Conception ===\nThe concept of copyright first developed in [[England]]. In reaction to the printing of \"scandalous books and pamphlets\", the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]] passed the [[Licensing of the Press Act 1662]],<ref name=histpersp/> which required all intended publications to be registered with the government-approved [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers' Company]], giving the Stationers the right to regulate what material could be printed.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1086/677787 |title=''Cum privilegio'': Licensing of the Press Act of 1662 |journal=The Library Quarterly |volume=84 |issue=4 |pages=494\u2013500 |url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/1/17219056/1/677787.pdf |year=2014 |last1=Nipps |first1=Karen }}</ref>\n\nThe Statute of Anne, enacted in 1710 in England and Scotland provided the first legislation to protect copyrights (but not authors' rights). The Copyright Act of 1814 extended more rights for authors but did not protect British from reprinting in the US. The Berne International Copyright Convention of 1886 finally provided protection for authors among the countries who signed the agreement, although the US did not join the Berne Convention until 1989.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Day O'Connor|first=Sandra|date=2002|title=Copyright Law from an American Perspective|journal=Irish Jurist|volume=37|pages=16\u201322|jstor=44027015}}</ref>\n\nIn the US, the Constitution grants Congress the right to establish copyright and patent laws. Shortly after the Constitution was passed, Congress enacted the Copyright Act of 1790, modeling it after the Statute of Anne. While the national law protected authors\u2019 published works, authority was granted to the states to protect authors\u2019 unpublished works. The most recent major overhaul of copyright in the US, the 1976 Copyright Act, extended federal copyright to works as soon as they are created and \"fixed\", without requiring publication or registration. State law continues to apply to unpublished works that are not otherwise copyrighted by federal law.<ref name=\":2\" /> This act also changed the calculation of copyright term from a fixed term (then a maximum of fifty-six years) to \"life of the author plus 50 years\". These changes brought the US closer to conformity with the Berne Convention, and in 1989 the United States further revised its copyright law and joined the Berne Convention officially.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nCopyright laws allow products of creative human activities, such as literary and artistic production, to be preferentially exploited and thus incentivized. Different cultural attitudes, social organizations, economic models and legal frameworks are seen to account for why copyright emerged in [[Europe]] and not, for example, in Asia. In the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, there was generally a lack of any concept of literary property due to the general relations of production, the specific organization of literary production and the role of culture in society. The latter refers to the tendency of oral societies, such as that of Europe in the medieval period, to view knowledge as the product and expression of the collective, rather than to see it as individual property. However, with copyright laws, intellectual production comes to be seen as a product of an individual, with attendant rights. The most significant point is that patent and copyright laws support the expansion of the range of creative human activities that can be commodified. This parallels the ways in which [[capitalism]] led to the [[commodification]] of many aspects of social life that earlier had no monetary or economic value per&nbsp;se.<ref>Bettig, Ronald V. (1996).

Westview Press''. p. 9\u201317. {{ISBN |0-8133-1385-6 }}.</ref>\n\nCopyright has developed into a concept that has a significant effect on nearly every modern industry, including not just literary work, but also forms of creative work such as [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recordings]], [[film]]s, [[photograph]]s, [[software]], and [[architecture]].\n\n=== National copyrights ===\n{{See also|Statute of Anne |History of copyright law of the United States }}\n[[File:Statute of anne.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Statute of Anne]] (the Copyright Act 1709) came into force in 1710.]]\nOften seen as the first real copyright law, the 1709 British [[Statute of Anne]] gave the publishers rights for a fixed period, after which the copyright expired.<ref name=\"Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language\">{{Cite book |title=Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language |page=13 |author=Ronan, Deazley |isbn=978-1-84542-282-0 |year=2006 |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing. |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC |via=Google Books }}</ref>\nThe act also alluded to individual rights of the artist. It began, \"Whereas Printers, Booksellers, and other Persons, have of late frequently taken the Liberty of Printing&nbsp;...

An irrevocable right to be recognized as the work's creator appears in some countries' copyright laws.\n\nThe [[Copyright Clause]] of the United States, Constitution (1787) authorized copyright legislation: \"To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.\" That is, by guaranteeing them a period of time in which they alone could profit from their works, they would be enabled and encouraged to invest the time required to create them, and this would be good for society as a whole. A right to profit from the work has been the philosophical underpinning for much legislation extending the duration of copyright, to the life of the creator and beyond, to their heirs.\n\nThe original length of copyright in the United States was 14&nbsp;years, and it had to be explicitly applied for. If the author wished, they could apply for a second 14\u2011year monopoly grant, but after that the work entered the [[public domain]], so it could be used and built upon by others.\n\nCopyright law was enacted rather [[Copyright in Germany|late in German states]], and the historian Eckhard H\u00f6ffner argues that the absence of copyright laws in the early 19th century encouraged publishing, was profitable for authors, led to a proliferation of books, enhanced knowledge, and was ultimately an important factor in the ascendency of Germany as a power during that century.<ref name=\"thad\">{{Cite magazine |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/0,1518,710976,00.html |author=Frank Thadeusz |title=No Copyright Law: The Real Reason for Germany's Industrial Expansion? |magazine=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=18 August 2010 |access-date=11 April 2015 }}</ref>\n\n=== International copyright treaties ===\n{{See also |International copyright agreements |List of parties to international copyright agreements }}\n[[File:Joseph Ferdinand Keppler - The Pirate Publisher - Puck Magazine - Restoration by Adam Cuerden.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|'' The Pirate Publisher\u2014An International Burlesque that has the Longest Run on Record'', from ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'', 1886, satirizes the then-existing situation where a publisher could profit by simply stealing newly published works from one country, and publishing them in another, and vice versa.]]\nThe 1886 [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] first established recognition of copyrights among [[Sovereignty|sovereign nations]], rather than merely bilaterally.

The Berne Convention also resulted in foreign authors being treated equivalently to domestic authors, in any country signed onto the Convention. The UK signed the Berne Convention in 1887 but did not implement large parts of it until 100&nbsp;years later with the passage of the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]]. Specially, for educational and scientific research purposes, the Berne Convention provides the developing countries issue compulsory licenses for the translation or reproduction of copyrighted works within the limits prescribed by the Convention. This was a special provision that had been added at the time of 1971 revision of the Convention, because of the strong demands of the developing countries. The United States did not sign the Berne Convention until 1989.<ref>Garfinkle, Ann M; Fries, Janet; Lopez, Daniel; Possessky, Laura (1997). \"Art conservation and the legal obligation to preserve artistic intent\".

Reid, 490 U.S. 730 (1989)</ref> For example, in [[English law]] the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 provides that if a copyrighted work is made by an employee in the course of that employment, the copyright is automatically owned by the employer which would be a \"Work for Hire\". Typically, the first owner of a copyright is the person who created the work i.e. the [[author]].<ref name=\"fairuse.stanford.edu\">{{Cite web |url=https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/faqs/copyright-ownership/ |title=Copyright Ownership: Who Owns What? |last=Stim |first=Rich |website=The Center for Internet and Society Fair Use Project |publisher=Stanford University |access-date=21 July 2019 |date=27 March 2013 }}</ref><ref name=\"fairuse.stanford.edu\" /> But when more than one person creates the work, then a case of [[joint authorship]] can be made provided some criteria are met.\n\n=== Eligible works ===\nCopyright may apply to a wide range of creative, intellectual, or artistic forms, or \"works\". Specifics vary by [[jurisdiction]], but these can include [[poem]]s, [[theses]], [[Copyright Protection for Fictional Characters|fictional characters]], [[drama|plays]] and other [[book|literary works]], [[film|motion pictures]], [[choreography]], [[music]]al compositions, [[sound recording]]s, [[painting]]s, [[drawing]]s, [[sculpture]]s, [[photography|photographs]], [[computer software]], [[radio]] and [[television]] [[Broadcasting|broadcasts]], and [[industrial design]]s.

Different countries impose different tests, although generally the requirements are low; in the [[United Kingdom]] there has to be some \"skill, labour, and judgment\" that has gone into it.<ref>''Express Newspaper Plc v News (UK) Plc'', F.S.R. 36 (1991)</ref> In [[Australia]] and the United Kingdom it has been held that a single word is insufficient to comprise a copyright work. However, single words or a short string of words can sometimes be registered as a [[trademark]] instead.\n\nCopyright law recognizes the right of an author based on whether the work actually is an [[Original work|original creation]], rather than based on [[Plagiarism checker|whether it is unique]]; two authors may own copyright on two substantially identical works, if it is determined that the duplication was coincidental, and neither was copied from the other.\n\n=== Registration ===\n{{Main |Copyright registration }}\nIn all countries where the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] standards apply, copyright is automatic, and need not be obtained through official registration with any government office. Once an idea has been reduced to tangible form, for example by securing it in a fixed medium (such as a drawing, sheet music, photograph, a videotape, or a computer file), the copyright holder is entitled to enforce his or her exclusive rights.<ref name=\"Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works Article 5\" /> However, while registration isn't needed to exercise copyright, in jurisdictions where the laws provide for registration, it serves as ''[[prima facie]]'' evidence of a valid copyright and enables the copyright holder to seek [[statutory damages for copyright infringement|statutory damages]] and attorney's fees.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright |url=http://copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.pdf |website=copyright.gov |access-date=4 June 2015 }}</ref> (In the US, registering after an infringement only enables one to receive actual damages and lost profits.)\n\nA widely circulated strategy to avoid the cost of copyright registration is referred to as the [[poor man's copyright]]. It proposes that the creator send the work to himself in a sealed envelope by registered mail, using the [[postmark]] to establish the date. This technique has not been recognized in any published opinions of the United States courts. <!-- Note to editors: The previously-worded statement, \"This technique has not been recognized by any United States court\" is overbroad because not all such cases are reported, and it is impossible to know whether this is correct.--> The United States Copyright Office says the technique is not a substitute for actual registration.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Copyright in General (FAQ) |url=http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-general.html#poorman |publisher=U.S Copyright Office |access-date=11 August 2016 }}</ref> The United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office discusses the technique and notes that the technique (as well as commercial registries) does not constitute dispositive proof that the work is original or establish who created the work.<ref>[http://www.ipo.gov.uk/copy/c-claim/c-register.htm \"Copyright Registers\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005014901/http://www.ipo.gov.uk/copy/c-claim/c-register.htm |date=5 October 2013 }}, United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office</ref><ref>[http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/copy/c-about/c-auto.htm \"Automatic right\"], United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office</ref> <!-- Note to editors: The previously-worded statement, \"The United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office discusses the technique but does not recommend its use.\" overstates the UK IPO position; the IPO does NOT recommend against the PMC approach.-->\n\n=== Fixing ===\nThe [[Berne Convention]] allows member countries to decide whether creative works must be \"fixed\" to enjoy copyright. Article 2, Section 2 of the Berne Convention states: \"It shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to prescribe that works in general or any specified categories of works shall not be protected unless they have been fixed in some material form.\" Some countries do not require that a work be produced in a particular form to obtain copyright protection. For instance, Spain, France, and Australia do not require fixation for copyright protection. The United States and Canada, on the other hand, require that most works must be \"fixed in a tangible medium of expression\" to obtain copyright protection.<ref name=\"cyber.law.harvard.edu\">See Harvard Law School, [http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/copyrightforlibrarians/Module_3:_The_Scope_of_Copyright_Law#Fixation ''Module 3: The Scope of Copyright Law''].

Similarly, Canadian courts consider fixation to require that the work be \"expressed to some extent at least in some material form, capable of identification and having a more or less permanent endurance\".<ref name=\"cyber.law.harvard.edu\" />\n\nNote this provision of US law: ''c) Effect of Berne Convention.\u2014No right or interest in a work eligible for protection under this title may be claimed by virtue of, or in reliance upon, the provisions of the Berne Convention, or the adherence of the United States thereto.

An analogous change was made in section&nbsp;402, dealing with copyright notices on phonorecords.</ref> Several years may be noted if the work has gone through substantial revisions. The proper copyright notice for sound recordings of musical or other audio works is a [[sound recording copyright symbol]] (\u2117, the letter&nbsp;'''P''' inside a circle), which indicates a sound recording copyright, with the letter&nbsp;'''P''' indicating a \"phonorecord\". In addition, the phrase ''[[All rights reserved]]'' was once required to assert copyright, but that phrase is now legally obsolete. Almost everything on the Internet has some sort of copyright attached to it. Whether these things are watermarked, signed, or have any other sort of indication of the copyright is a different story however.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The People's Platform:Taking Back Power and Culture in the Digital Age. |last=Taylor |first=Astra |publisher=Picador |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-250-06259-8 |location=New York City, New York, USA |pages=144\u2013145 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1989 the United States enacted the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] Implementation Act, amending the 1976&nbsp;Copyright Act to conform to most of the provisions of the Berne Convention. As a result, the use of copyright notices has become optional to claim copyright, because the Berne Convention makes copyright automatic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ03.pdf |title=U.S. Copyright Office \u2013 Information Circular |access-date=7 July 2012 }}</ref> However, the lack of notice of copyright using these marks may have consequences in terms of reduced damages in an infringement lawsuit&nbsp;\u2013 using notices of this form may reduce the likelihood of a defense of \"innocent infringement\" being successful.<ref>[[17 U.S.C.]]{{UnitedStatesCodeSec |17 |401(d) }}</ref>\n\n== Enforcement ==\nCopyrights are generally enforced by the holder in a [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]] court, but there are also criminal infringement statutes in some jurisdictions. While [[copyright registry|central registries]] are kept in some countries which aid in proving claims of ownership, registering does not necessarily prove ownership, nor does the fact of copying (even without permission) necessarily [[legal proof|prove]] that copyright was infringed. Criminal sanctions are generally aimed at serious counterfeiting activity, but are now becoming more commonplace as copyright collectives such as the [[RIAA]] are increasingly targeting the [[file sharing]] home Internet user. Thus far, however, most such cases against file sharers have been settled out of court. (See: [[Legal aspects of file sharing]])\n\nIn most jurisdictions the copyright holder must bear the cost of enforcing copyright. This will usually involve engaging legal representation, administrative or court costs. In light of this, many copyright disputes are settled by a direct approach to the infringing party in order to settle the dispute out of court.\n\n\"...by 1978, the scope was expanded to apply to any 'expression' that has been 'fixed' in any medium, this protection granted automatically whether the maker wants it or not, no registration required.\"<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Astra |title=The People's Platform: Taking Back Power and Culture in the Digital Age |date=2014 |publisher=Picador |location=New York, New York |isbn=978-1-250-06259-8 |page=148 }}</ref>\n\n=== Copyright infringement ===\n{{Main|Copyright infringement}}\nFor a work to be considered to infringe upon copyright, its use must have occurred in a nation that has domestic copyright laws or adheres to a bilateral treaty or established international convention such as the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] or [[World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty|WIPO Copyright Treaty]].

Economic rights allow right owners to derive financial reward from the use of their works by others. Moral rights allow authors and creators to take certain actions to preserve and protect their link with their work. The author or creator may be the owner of the economic rights or those rights may be transferred to one or more copyright owners. Many countries do not allow the transfer of moral rights. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/wipo_pub_909_2016.pdf |title=World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO). |date=20 April 2019 }}</ref>\n\n=== Economic rights ===\nWith any kind of property, its owner may decide how it is to be used, and others can use it lawfully only if they have the owner's permission, often through a license. The owner's use of the property must, however, respect the legally recognised rights and interests of other members of society. So the owner of a copyright-protected work may decide how to use the work, and may prevent others from using it without permission. National laws usually grant copyright owners exclusive rights to allow third parties to use their works, subject to the legally recognised rights and interests of others.<ref name=\":0\" /> Most copyright laws state that authors or other right owners have the right to authorise or prevent certain acts in relation to a work. Right owners can authorise or prohibit:\n\n* reproduction of the work in various forms, such as printed publications or sound recordings;\n* distribution of copies of the work;\n* public performance of the work;\n* broadcasting or other communication of the work to the public;\n* translation of the work into other languages; and\n* adaptation of the work, such as turning a novel into a screenplay.\n\n=== Moral rights ===\nMoral rights are concerned with the non-economic rights of a creator. They protect the creator's connection with a work as well as the integrity of the work. Moral rights are only accorded to individual authors and in many national laws they remain with the authors even after the authors have transferred their economic rights. In some EU countries, such as France, moral rights last indefinitely. In the UK, however, moral rights are finite. That is, the right of attribution and the right of integrity last only as long as the work is in copyright. When the copyright term comes to an end, so too do the moral rights in that work. This is just one reason why the moral rights regime within the UK is often regarded as weaker or inferior to the protection of moral rights in continental Europe and elsewhere in the world.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.copyrightuser.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/CU_CaseFile_11.pdf |title=THE MUTILATED WORK |website=Copyright User }}</ref> The Berne Convention, in Article 6bis, requires its members to grant authors the following rights:\n\n# the right to claim authorship of a work (sometimes called the right of paternity or the right of attribution); and\n# the right to object to any distortion or modification of a work, or other derogatory action in relation to a work, which would be prejudicial to the author's honour or reputation (sometimes called the right of integrity).\n\nThese and other similar rights granted in national laws are generally known as the moral rights of authors. The Berne Convention requires these rights to be independent of authors\u2019 economic rights. Moral rights are only accorded to individual authors and in many national laws they remain with the authors even after the authors have transferred their economic rights. This means that even where, for example, a film producer or publisher owns the economic rights in a work, in many jurisdictions the individual author continues to have moral rights.<ref name=\":0\" /> Recently, as a part of the debates being held at the [[U.S. Copyright Office]] on the question of inclusion of Moral Rights as a part of the framework of the [[Copyright law of the United States|Copyright Law in United States]], the Copyright Office concluded that many diverse aspects of the current moral rights patchwork\u2014including copyright law's derivative work right, state moral rights statutes, and contract law\u2014are generally working well and should not be changed. Further, the Office concludes that there is no need for the creation of a blanket moral rights statute at this time. However, there are aspects of the U.S. moral rights patchwork that could be improved to the benefit of individual authors and the copyright system as a whole.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.copyright.gov/policy/moralrights/full-report.pdf |title=authors, attribution, and integrity: examining moral rights in the united states |date=April 2019 |website=U.S. Copyright Office }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Copyright law of the United States|Copyright Law in the United States]], several exclusive rights are granted to the holder of a copyright, as are listed below:\n\n* protection of the work\n* to determine and decide how, and under what conditions, the work may be marketed, publicly displayed, reproduced, distributed etc.\n* to produce copies or reproductions of the work and to sell those copies (including, typically, electronic copies)\n* to import or export the work\n* to create [[derivative work]]s (works that adapt the original work)\n* to perform or display the work publicly\n* to sell or cede these rights to others\n* to transmit or display by radio, video or internet.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book |title=Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights |page=346 |author=Peter K, Yu |isbn=978-0-275-98883-8 |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group }}</ref>\n\nThe basic right when a work is protected by copyright is that the holder may determine and decide how and under what conditions the protected work may be used by others. This includes the right to decide to distribute the work for free. This part of copyright is often overseen. The phrase \"exclusive right\" means that only the copyright holder is free to exercise those rights, and others are prohibited from using the work without the holder's permission. Copyright is sometimes called a \"negative right\", as it serves to prohibit certain people (e.g., readers, viewers, or listeners, and primarily publishers and would be publishers) from doing something they would otherwise be able to do, rather than permitting people (e.g., authors) to do something they would otherwise be unable to do. In this way it is similar to the [[unregistered design right]] in [[English law]] and [[European law]]. The rights of the copyright holder also permit him/her to not use or exploit their copyright, for some or all of the term. There is, however, a critique which rejects this assertion as being based on a [[Philosophy of copyright|philosophical interpretation of copyright law]] that is not universally shared. There is also debate on whether copyright should be considered a [[property right]] or a [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral right]].<ref>Tom G. Palmer, [http://www.tomgpalmer.com/wp-content/uploads/papers/morallyjustified.pdf \"Are Patents and Copyrights Morally Justified?\"] Accessed 5 February 2013.</ref>\n\n[[UK copyright law]] gives creators both economic rights and moral rights. While \u2018copying\u2019 someone else's work without permission may constitute an infringement of their economic rights, that is, the reproduction right or the right of communication to the public, whereas, \u2018mutilating\u2019 it might infringe the creator's moral rights. In the UK, moral rights include the right to be identified as the author of the work, which is generally identified as the right of attribution, and the right not to have your work subjected to \u2018derogatory treatment\u2019, that is the right of integrity.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[Copyright law of India|Indian copyright law]] is at parity with the international standards as contained in [[TRIPS Agreement|TRIPS]].

The length of the term can depend on several factors, including the type of work (e.g. musical composition, novel), whether the work has been [[Publication|published]], and whether the work was created by an individual or a corporation. In most of the world, the default length of copyright is the life of the author plus either 50 or 70 years. In the United States, the term for most existing works is a fixed number of years after the date of creation or publication. Under most countries' laws (for example, the United States<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode |17 |305 }}</ref> and the United Kingdom<ref>The Duration of Copyright and Rights in Performances Regulations 1995, [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19953297_en_3.htm part II], Amendments of the UK Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988</ref>), copyrights expire at the end of the calendar year in which they would otherwise expire.\n\nThe length and requirements for copyright duration are subject to change by legislation, and since the early 20th century there have been a number of adjustments made in various countries, which can make determining the duration of a given copyright somewhat difficult. For example, the United States used to require copyrights to be renewed after 28 years to stay in force, and formerly required a copyright notice upon first publication to gain coverage. In Italy and France, there were post-wartime extensions that could increase the term by approximately 6 years in Italy and up to about 14 in France. Many countries have extended the length of their copyright terms (sometimes retroactively). International treaties establish minimum terms for copyrights, but individual countries may enforce longer terms than those.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Copyright: Sacred Text, Technology, and the DMCA |last=Nimmer |first=David |publisher=Kluwer Law International |year=2003 |isbn=978-90-411-8876-2 |oclc=50606064 |page=63 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=RYfRCNxgPO4C |via=Google Books }}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, all books and other works published before 1923 have expired copyrights and are in the public domain.<ref>\"[http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States].\", ''[[Cornell University]]''.</ref> In addition, works published before 1964 that did not have their copyrights renewed 28 years after first publication year also are in the public domain. Hirtle points out that the great majority of these works (including 93% of the books) were not renewed after 28 years and are in the public domain.<ref>See Peter B.

If the author has been dead more than 70 years, the work is in the public domain in most, but not all, countries.\n\nIn 1998, the length of a copyright in the United States was increased by 20 years under the Copyright Term Extension Act. This legislation was strongly promoted by corporations which had valuable copyrights which otherwise would have expired, and has been the subject of substantial criticism on this point.<ref>Lawrence Lessig, ''Copyright's First Amendment'', 48 UCLA L. Rev. 1057, 1065 (2001)</ref>\n\n== Limitations and exceptions ==\n{{Main|Limitations and exceptions to copyright }}\n\nIn many jurisdictions, copyright law makes exceptions to these restrictions when the work is copied for the purpose of commentary or other related uses. United States copyright law does not cover names, titles, short phrases or listings (such as ingredients, recipes, labels, or formulas).<ref>[http://copyright.gov/circs/circ34.pdf (2012) ''Copyright Protection Not Available for Names, Titles, or Short Phrases'' U.S. Copyright Office]</ref> However, there are protections available for those areas copyright does not cover, such as [[trademark]]s and [[patent]]s.\n\n=== Idea\u2013expression dichotomy and the merger doctrine ===\n{{Main|Idea\u2013expression divide }}\n\nThe idea\u2013expression divide differentiates between ideas and expression, and states that copyright protects only the original expression of ideas, and not the ideas themselves. This principle, first clarified in the 1879 case of [[Baker v. Selden]], has since been codified by the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] at 17 U.S.C. \u00a7&nbsp;102(b).\n\n=== The first-sale doctrine and exhaustion of rights ===\n\n{{Main|First-sale doctrine |Exhaustion of rights }}\nCopyright law does not restrict the owner of a copy from reselling legitimately obtained copies of copyrighted works, provided that those copies were originally produced by or with the permission of the copyright holder. It is therefore legal, for example, to resell a copyrighted book or [[compact disc|CD]]. In the United States this is known as the [[first-sale doctrine]], and was established by the [[court]]s to clarify the legality of reselling books in second-hand [[bookstore]]s.\n\nSome countries may have [[parallel importation]] restrictions that allow the copyright holder to control the [[aftermarket (merchandise)|aftermarket]]. This may mean for example that a copy of a book that does not infringe copyright in the country where it was printed does infringe copyright in a country into which it is imported for retailing. The first-sale doctrine is known as [[exhaustion of rights]] in other countries and is a principle which also applies, though somewhat differently, to [[patent]] and [[trademark]] rights. It is important to note that the first-sale doctrine permits the transfer of the particular legitimate copy involved. It does not permit making or distributing additional copies.\n\nIn ''[[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.]]'',<ref>{{cite web |title=John Wiley & Sons Inc. v. Kirtsaeng |url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-697_d1o2.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702033641/https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-697_d1o2.pdf |archivedate=2 July 2017  }}</ref> in 2013, the [[United States Supreme Court]] held in a 6\u20133 decision that the first-sale doctrine applies to goods manufactured abroad with the copyright owner's permission and then imported into the US without such permission. The case involved a plaintiff who imported Asian editions of textbooks that had been manufactured abroad with the publisher-plaintiff's permission. The defendant, without permission from the publisher, imported the textbooks and resold on eBay. The Supreme Court's holding severely limits the ability of copyright holders to prevent such importation.\n\nIn addition, copyright, in most cases, does not prohibit one from acts such as modifying, defacing, or destroying his or her own legitimately obtained copy of a copyrighted work, so long as duplication is not involved. However, in countries that implement [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]], a copyright holder can in some cases successfully prevent the mutilation or destruction of a work that is publicly visible.\n\n=== Fair use and fair dealing ===\n{{Main|Fair use |Fair dealing }}\nCopyright does not prohibit all copying or replication. In the United States, the [[fair use]] doctrine, codified by the [[United States Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act of 1976]] as 17 U.S.C. Section 107, permits some copying and distribution without permission of the copyright holder or payment to same. The statute does not clearly define fair use, but instead gives four non-exclusive factors to consider in a fair use analysis. Those factors are:\n# the purpose and character of one's use\n# the nature of the copyrighted work\n# what amount and proportion of the whole work was taken, and\n# the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/107.html |title=US CODE: Title 17,107. Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use |publisher=.law.cornell.edu |date=20 May 2009 |access-date=16 June 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]] and many other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, a similar notion of fair dealing was established by the [[court]]s or through [[legislation]]. The concept is sometimes not well defined; however in [[Canada]], private copying for personal use has been expressly permitted by statute since 1999. In ''[[Alberta (Education) v. Canadian Copyright Licensing Agency (Access Copyright)]]'', 2012 SCC 37, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] concluded that limited copying for educational purposes could also be justified under the fair dealing exemption. In Australia, the fair dealing exceptions under the ''Copyright Act 1968'' (Cth) are a limited set of circumstances under which copyrighted material can be legally copied or adapted without the copyright holder's consent. Fair dealing uses are research and study; review and critique; news reportage and the giving of professional advice (i.e. [[legal advice]]). Under current [[Law of Australia|Australian law]], although it is still a breach of copyright to copy, reproduce or adapt copyright material for personal or private use without permission from the copyright owner, owners of a legitimate copy are permitted to \"format shift\" that work from one medium to another for personal, private use, or to \"time shift\" a broadcast work for later, once and only once, viewing or listening. Other technical exemptions from infringement may also apply, such as the temporary reproduction of a work in machine readable form for a computer.\n\nIn the United States the AHRA ([[Audio Home Recording Act]] Codified in Section 10, 1992) prohibits action against consumers making noncommercial recordings of music, in return for royalties on both media and devices plus mandatory copy-control mechanisms on recorders.\n\n:''Section 1008. Prohibition on certain infringement actions''\n\n:''No action may be brought under this title alleging infringement of copyright based on the manufacture, importation, or distribution of a digital audio recording device, a digital audio recording medium, an analog recording device, or an analog recording medium, or based on the noncommercial use by a consumer of such a device or medium for making digital musical recordings or analog musical recordings.''\n\nLater acts amended US Copyright law so that for certain purposes making 10 copies or more is construed to be commercial, but there is no general rule permitting such copying. Indeed, making one complete copy of a work, or in many cases using a portion of it, for commercial purposes will not be considered fair use. The [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] prohibits the manufacture, importation, or distribution of devices whose intended use, or only significant commercial use, is to bypass an access or copy control put in place by a copyright owner.<ref name=\"Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights\" /> An appellate court has held that fair use is not a defense to engaging in such distribution.\n\n[[Copyright law of the European Union|EU copyright laws]] recognise the right of EU member states to implement some national exceptions to copyright. Examples of those exceptions are:\n*photographic reproductions on paper or any similar medium of works (excluding sheet music) provided that the rightholders receives fair compensation,\n*reproduction made by libraries, educational establishments, museums or archives, which are non-commercial\n*archival reproductions of broadcasts,\n*uses for the benefit of people with a disability,\n*for demonstration or repair of equipment,\n*for non-commercial research or private study\n*when used in [[parody]]\n\n=== Accessible copies ===\nIt is legal in several countries including the United Kingdom and the United States to produce alternative versions (for example, in large print or braille) of a copyrighted work to provide improved access to a work for blind and visually impaired people without permission from the copyright holder.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#121 |title=Chapter 1 \u2013 Circular 92 \u2013 U.S. Copyright Office |website=www.copyright.gov }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rnib.org.uk/xpedio/groups/public/documents/publicwebsite/public_cvipsact2002.hcsp |title=Copyright (Visually Impaired Persons) Act 2002 comes into force |publisher=Royal National Institute of Blind People |date=1 January 2011 |access-date=11 August 2016 }}</ref>\n\n== {{Anchor |Transfer and licensing, and assignment }} Transfer, assignment and licensing ==\n{{See also|Collective rights management |Extended collective licensing |Compulsory license |Copyright transfer agreement }}\n[[File:All rights reserved.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|DVD: [[All Rights Reserved]].]]\nA copyright, or aspects of it (e.g. reproduction alone, all but moral rights), may be assigned or transferred from one party to another.<ref name=\"WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights\">{{Cite book |title=WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&as_brr=3 |isbn=978-92-805-1271-7 |year=2004 |publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization |page=15 }}</ref> For example, a musician who records an album will often sign an agreement with a record company in which the musician agrees to transfer all copyright in the recordings in exchange for royalties and other considerations. The creator (and original copyright holder) benefits, or expects to, from production and marketing capabilities far beyond those of the author. In the digital age of music, music may be copied and distributed at minimal cost through the [[Internet]]; however, the [[record industry]] attempts to provide promotion and marketing for the artist and their work so it can reach a much larger audience. A copyright holder need not transfer all rights completely, though many publishers will insist. Some of the rights may be transferred, or else the copyright holder may grant another party a non-exclusive license to copy or distribute the work in a particular region or for a specified period of time.\n\nA transfer or licence may have to meet particular formal requirements in order to be effective,<ref name=\"WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights(2)\">{{Cite book |title=WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&as_brr=3 |page=8 |isbn=978-92-805-1271-7 |year=2004 |publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization }}</ref> for example under the Australian [[Copyright law of Australia#Copyright Act 1968|Copyright Act 1968]] the copyright itself must be expressly transferred in writing. Under the U.S. Copyright Act, a transfer of ownership in copyright must be memorialized in a writing signed by the transferor. For that purpose, ownership in copyright includes exclusive licenses of rights. Thus exclusive licenses, to be effective, must be granted in a written instrument signed by the grantor. No special form of transfer or grant is required. A simple document that identifies the work involved and the rights being granted is sufficient. Non-exclusive grants (often called non-exclusive licenses) need not be in writing under [[Law of the United States|U.S. law]]. They can be oral or even implied by the behavior of the parties. Transfers of copyright ownership, including exclusive licenses, may and should be recorded in the U.S. Copyright Office. (Information on recording transfers is available on the Office's web site.) While recording is not required to make the grant effective, it offers important benefits, much like those obtained by recording a deed in a [[real estate]] transaction.\n\nCopyright may also be [[license]]d.<ref name=\"WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights\" /> Some jurisdictions may provide that certain classes of copyrighted works be made available under a prescribed [[statutory license]] (e.g. musical works in the United States used for radio broadcast or performance). This is also called a [[compulsory license]], because under this scheme, anyone who wishes to copy a covered work does not need the permission of the copyright holder, but instead merely files the proper notice and pays a set fee established by statute (or by an agency decision under statutory guidance) for every copy made.<ref name=\"WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights(3)\">{{Cite book |title=WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&as_brr=3 |page=16 |isbn=978-92-805-1271-7 |year=2004 |publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization }}</ref> Failure to follow the proper procedures would place the copier at risk of an infringement suit. Because of the difficulty of following every individual work, [[copyright collective]]s or [[collecting societies]] and [[performance rights organisation|performing rights organizations]] (such as [[ASCAP]], [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]], and [[SESAC]]) have been formed to collect royalties for hundreds (thousands and more) works at once. Though this market solution bypasses the statutory license, the availability of the statutory fee still helps dictate the price per work collective rights organizations charge, driving it down to what avoidance of procedural hassle would justify.\n\n=== Free licenses ===\nCopyright licenses known as ''open'' or [[free license]]s seek to grant several rights to licensees, either for a fee or not. ''Free'' in this context is not as much of a reference to price as it is to freedom. What constitutes free licensing has been characterised in a number of similar definitions, including by order of longevity the [[Free Software Definition]], the [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]], the [[Open Source Definition]] and the [[Definition of Free Cultural Works]]. Further refinements to these definitions have resulted in categories such as [[copyleft]] and [[permissive license|permissive]]. Common examples of free licences are the [[GNU General Public License]], [[BSD license]]s and some [[Creative Commons licenses]].\n\nFounded in 2001 by [[James Boyle (academic)|James Boyle]], [[Lawrence Lessig]], and [[Hal Abelson]], the [[Creative Commons]] (CC) is a non-profit organization<ref name=\"CC\">{{Cite web |url=https://creativecommons.org/ |title=Creative Commons Website |website=creativecommons.org |access-date=24 October 2011 }}</ref> which aims to facilitate the legal sharing of creative works. To this end, the organization provides a number of generic copyright license options to the public, [[gratis versus libre|gratis]]. These licenses allow copyright holders to define conditions under which others may use a work and to specify what types of use are acceptable.<ref name=\"CC\" />\n\nTerms of use have traditionally been negotiated on an individual basis between copyright holder and potential licensee. Therefore, a general CC license outlining which rights the copyright holder is willing to waive enables the general public to use such works more freely. Six general types of CC licenses are available (although some of them are not properly free per the above definitions and per Creative Commons' own advice). These are based upon copyright-holder stipulations such as whether he or she is willing to allow modifications to the work, whether he or she permits the creation of derivative works and whether he or she is willing to permit commercial use of the work.<ref name=\"Rubin\">Rubin, R. E. (2010) 'Foundations of Library and Information Science: Third Edition', Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc., New York, p. 341</ref> {{As of |2009 }} approximately 130 million individuals had received such licenses.<ref name=\"Rubin\" />\n\n== Criticism ==\n{{Main |Criticism of copyright }}\nSome sources are critical of particular aspects of the copyright system. This is known as a debate over [[copynorms]]. Particularly to the background of uploading content to internet platforms and the digital exchange of original work, there is discussion about the [[copyright aspects of downloading and streaming]], the [[copyright aspects of hyperlinking and framing]].\n\nConcerns are often couched in the language of [[digital rights]], digital freedom, [[database right]]s, [[open data]] or [[censorship]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://edri.org/press-release-meps-ignore-expert-advice-and-vote-for-mass-internet-censorship/ |title=MEPs ignore expert advice and vote for mass internet censorship |publisher=European Digital Rights |access-date=24 June 2018 |date=20 June 2018 }}</ref> Discussions include ''[[Free Culture (book)|Free Culture]]'', a 2004 book by [[Lawrence Lessig]]. Lessig coined the term [[permission culture]] to describe a worst-case system. ''[[Good Copy Bad Copy]]'' (documentary) and [[RiP!: A Remix Manifesto]], discuss copyright. Some suggest an [[alternative compensation system]]. In Europe consumers are acting up against the raising costs of music, film and books, and as a result [[Pirate Party|Pirate Parties]] have been created. Some groups reject copyright altogether, taking an [[anti-copyright]] stance. The perceived inability to enforce copyright online leads some to advocate [[Crypto-anarchism|ignoring legal statutes when on the web]].\nasdsadasdsads\n\n== Public domain ==\n{{Main |Public domain }}\nCopyright, like other [[intellectual property rights]], is subject to a statutorily determined term. Once the term of a copyright has expired, the formerly copyrighted work enters the public domain and may be used or exploited by anyone without obtaining permission, and normally without payment. However, in [[paying public domain]] regimes the user may still have to pay royalties to the state or to an authors' association. Courts in common law countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, have rejected the doctrine of a [[common law copyright]]. Public domain works should not be confused with works that are publicly available. Works posted in the [[internet]], for example, are publicly available, but are not generally in the public domain. Copying such works may therefore violate the author's copyright.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal |Law }}\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Adelphi Charter]]\n* [[Artificial scarcity]]\n* [[Authors' rights]] and [[related rights]], roughly equivalent concepts in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries\n* [[Conflict of laws]]\n* [[Copyleft]]\n* [[Copyright Alliance]]\n* [[Copyright in architecture in the United States]]\n* [[Copyright on the content of patents and in the context of patent prosecution]]\n* [[Copyright for Creativity]]\n* [[Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market]] (European Union)\n* [[Copyright infringement]]\n* [[Copyright on religious works]]\n* [[Copyright Remedy Clarification Act]] (CRCA)\n* [[Creative Barcode]]\n* [[Digital rights management]]\n* [[Digital watermarking]]\n* [[Entertainment law]]\n* [[Freedom of panorama]]\n* [[Information literacies]]\n* [[Intellectual property protection of typefaces]]\n* [[List of Copyright Acts]]\n* [[List of copyright case law]]\n* [[Literary property]]\n* [[Model release]]\n* [[Criticism of copyright]]\n* [[Paracopyright]]\n* [[Photography and the law]]\n* [[Pirate Party]]\n* [[Printing patent]], a precursor to copyright\n* [[Private copying levy]]\n* [[Production music]]\n* [[Rent-seeking]]\n* [[Reproduction fees]]\n* [[Samizdat]]\n* [[Software copyright]]\n* [[Threshold pledge system]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book\n  |author=Dowd, Raymond J.\n  |title=Copyright Litigation Handbook\n  |publisher=Thomson West |edition=1st |year=2006\n  |isbn=0-314-96279-4\n  |ref=Dowd, Litigation handbook\n}}\n* Ellis, Sara R.

The Copyright Act of 1814 extended more rights for authors but did not protect British from reprinting in the US. The Berne International Copyright Convention of 1886 finally provided protection for authors among the countries who signed the agreement, although the US did not join the Berne Convention until 1989.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Day O'Connor|first=Sandra|date=2002|title=Copyright Law from an American Perspective|journal=Irish Jurist|volume=37|pages=16\u201322|jstor=44027015}}</ref>\n\nIn the US, the Constitution grants Congress the right to establish copyright and patent laws. Shortly after the Constitution was passed, Congress enacted the Copyright Act of 1790, modeling it after the Statute of Anne. While the national law protected authors\u2019 published works, authority was granted to the states to protect authors\u2019 unpublished works. The most recent major overhaul of copyright in the US, the 1976 Copyright Act, extended federal copyright to works as soon as they are created and \"fixed\", without requiring publication or registration. State law continues to apply to unpublished works that are not otherwise copyrighted by federal law.<ref name=\":2\" /> This act also changed the calculation of copyright term from a fixed term (then a maximum of fifty-six years) to \"life of the author plus 50 years\". These changes brought the US closer to conformity with the Berne Convention, and in 1989 the United States further revised its copyright law and joined the Berne Convention officially.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nCopyright laws allow products of creative human activities, such as literary and artistic production, to be preferentially exploited and thus incentivized. Different cultural attitudes, social organizations, economic models and legal frameworks are seen to account for why copyright emerged in [[Europe]] and not, for example, in Asia. In the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, there was generally a lack of any concept of literary property due to the general relations of production, the specific organization of literary production and the role of culture in society. The latter refers to the tendency of oral societies, such as that of Europe in the medieval period, to view knowledge as the product and expression of the collective, rather than to see it as individual property. However, with copyright laws, intellectual production comes to be seen as a product of an individual, with attendant rights. The most significant point is that patent and copyright laws support the expansion of the range of creative human activities that can be commodified. This parallels the ways in which [[capitalism]] led to the [[commodification]] of many aspects of social life that earlier had no monetary or economic value per&nbsp;se.<ref>Bettig, Ronald V. (1996).

Article 2, Section 2 of the Berne Convention states: \"It shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to prescribe that works in general or any specified categories of works shall not be protected unless they have been fixed in some material form.\" Some countries do not require that a work be produced in a particular form to obtain copyright protection. For instance, Spain, France, and Australia do not require fixation for copyright protection. The United States and Canada, on the other hand, require that most works must be \"fixed in a tangible medium of expression\" to obtain copyright protection.<ref name=\"cyber.law.harvard.edu\">See Harvard Law School, [http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/copyrightforlibrarians/Module_3:_The_Scope_of_Copyright_Law#Fixation ''Module 3: The Scope of Copyright Law''].

While [[copyright registry|central registries]] are kept in some countries which aid in proving claims of ownership, registering does not necessarily prove ownership, nor does the fact of copying (even without permission) necessarily [[legal proof|prove]] that copyright was infringed. Criminal sanctions are generally aimed at serious counterfeiting activity, but are now becoming more commonplace as copyright collectives such as the [[RIAA]] are increasingly targeting the [[file sharing]] home Internet user. Thus far, however, most such cases against file sharers have been settled out of court. (See: [[Legal aspects of file sharing]])\n\nIn most jurisdictions the copyright holder must bear the cost of enforcing copyright. This will usually involve engaging legal representation, administrative or court costs. In light of this, many copyright disputes are settled by a direct approach to the infringing party in order to settle the dispute out of court.\n\n\"...by 1978, the scope was expanded to apply to any 'expression' that has been 'fixed' in any medium, this protection granted automatically whether the maker wants it or not, no registration required.\"<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Astra |title=The People's Platform: Taking Back Power and Culture in the Digital Age |date=2014 |publisher=Picador |location=New York, New York |isbn=978-1-250-06259-8 |page=148 }}</ref>\n\n=== Copyright infringement ===\n{{Main|Copyright infringement}}\nFor a work to be considered to infringe upon copyright, its use must have occurred in a nation that has domestic copyright laws or adheres to a bilateral treaty or established international convention such as the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] or [[World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty|WIPO Copyright Treaty]].

The author or creator may be the owner of the economic rights or those rights may be transferred to one or more copyright owners. Many countries do not allow the transfer of moral rights. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/wipo_pub_909_2016.pdf |title=World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO). |date=20 April 2019 }}</ref>\n\n=== Economic rights ===\nWith any kind of property, its owner may decide how it is to be used, and others can use it lawfully only if they have the owner's permission, often through a license. The owner's use of the property must, however, respect the legally recognised rights and interests of other members of society. So the owner of a copyright-protected work may decide how to use the work, and may prevent others from using it without permission. National laws usually grant copyright owners exclusive rights to allow third parties to use their works, subject to the legally recognised rights and interests of others.<ref name=\":0\" /> Most copyright laws state that authors or other right owners have the right to authorise or prevent certain acts in relation to a work. Right owners can authorise or prohibit:\n\n* reproduction of the work in various forms, such as printed publications or sound recordings;\n* distribution of copies of the work;\n* public performance of the work;\n* broadcasting or other communication of the work to the public;\n* translation of the work into other languages; and\n* adaptation of the work, such as turning a novel into a screenplay.\n\n=== Moral rights ===\nMoral rights are concerned with the non-economic rights of a creator. They protect the creator's connection with a work as well as the integrity of the work. Moral rights are only accorded to individual authors and in many national laws they remain with the authors even after the authors have transferred their economic rights. In some EU countries, such as France, moral rights last indefinitely. In the UK, however, moral rights are finite. That is, the right of attribution and the right of integrity last only as long as the work is in copyright. When the copyright term comes to an end, so too do the moral rights in that work. This is just one reason why the moral rights regime within the UK is often regarded as weaker or inferior to the protection of moral rights in continental Europe and elsewhere in the world.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.copyrightuser.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/CU_CaseFile_11.pdf |title=THE MUTILATED WORK |website=Copyright User }}</ref> The Berne Convention, in Article 6bis, requires its members to grant authors the following rights:\n\n# the right to claim authorship of a work (sometimes called the right of paternity or the right of attribution); and\n# the right to object to any distortion or modification of a work, or other derogatory action in relation to a work, which would be prejudicial to the author's honour or reputation (sometimes called the right of integrity).\n\nThese and other similar rights granted in national laws are generally known as the moral rights of authors. The Berne Convention requires these rights to be independent of authors\u2019 economic rights. Moral rights are only accorded to individual authors and in many national laws they remain with the authors even after the authors have transferred their economic rights. This means that even where, for example, a film producer or publisher owns the economic rights in a work, in many jurisdictions the individual author continues to have moral rights.<ref name=\":0\" /> Recently, as a part of the debates being held at the [[U.S. Copyright Office]] on the question of inclusion of Moral Rights as a part of the framework of the [[Copyright law of the United States|Copyright Law in United States]], the Copyright Office concluded that many diverse aspects of the current moral rights patchwork\u2014including copyright law's derivative work right, state moral rights statutes, and contract law\u2014are generally working well and should not be changed. Further, the Office concludes that there is no need for the creation of a blanket moral rights statute at this time. However, there are aspects of the U.S. moral rights patchwork that could be improved to the benefit of individual authors and the copyright system as a whole.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.copyright.gov/policy/moralrights/full-report.pdf |title=authors, attribution, and integrity: examining moral rights in the united states |date=April 2019 |website=U.S. Copyright Office }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Copyright law of the United States|Copyright Law in the United States]], several exclusive rights are granted to the holder of a copyright, as are listed below:\n\n* protection of the work\n* to determine and decide how, and under what conditions, the work may be marketed, publicly displayed, reproduced, distributed etc.\n* to produce copies or reproductions of the work and to sell those copies (including, typically, electronic copies)\n* to import or export the work\n* to create [[derivative work]]s (works that adapt the original work)\n* to perform or display the work publicly\n* to sell or cede these rights to others\n* to transmit or display by radio, video or internet.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book |title=Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights |page=346 |author=Peter K, Yu |isbn=978-0-275-98883-8 |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group }}</ref>\n\nThe basic right when a work is protected by copyright is that the holder may determine and decide how and under what conditions the protected work may be used by others. This includes the right to decide to distribute the work for free. This part of copyright is often overseen. The phrase \"exclusive right\" means that only the copyright holder is free to exercise those rights, and others are prohibited from using the work without the holder's permission. Copyright is sometimes called a \"negative right\", as it serves to prohibit certain people (e.g., readers, viewers, or listeners, and primarily publishers and would be publishers) from doing something they would otherwise be able to do, rather than permitting people (e.g., authors) to do something they would otherwise be unable to do. In this way it is similar to the [[unregistered design right]] in [[English law]] and [[European law]]. The rights of the copyright holder also permit him/her to not use or exploit their copyright, for some or all of the term. There is, however, a critique which rejects this assertion as being based on a [[Philosophy of copyright|philosophical interpretation of copyright law]] that is not universally shared. There is also debate on whether copyright should be considered a [[property right]] or a [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral right]].<ref>Tom G. Palmer, [http://www.tomgpalmer.com/wp-content/uploads/papers/morallyjustified.pdf \"Are Patents and Copyrights Morally Justified?\"] Accessed 5 February 2013.</ref>\n\n[[UK copyright law]] gives creators both economic rights and moral rights. While \u2018copying\u2019 someone else's work without permission may constitute an infringement of their economic rights, that is, the reproduction right or the right of communication to the public, whereas, \u2018mutilating\u2019 it might infringe the creator's moral rights. In the UK, moral rights include the right to be identified as the author of the work, which is generally identified as the right of attribution, and the right not to have your work subjected to \u2018derogatory treatment\u2019, that is the right of integrity.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[Copyright law of India|Indian copyright law]] is at parity with the international standards as contained in [[TRIPS Agreement|TRIPS]]. The Indian Copyright Act, 1957, pursuant to the amendments in 1999, 2002 and 2012, fully reflects the Berne Convention for Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, 1886 and the Universal Copyrights Convention, to which India is a party. India is also a party to the Geneva Convention for the Protection of Rights of Producers of Phonograms and is an active member of the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) and [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO). The Indian system provides both the economic and moral rights under different provisions of its Indian Copyright Act of 1957.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mondaq.com/india/x/655852/Copyright/Copyright+Law+In+India+Everything+You+Must+Know|title=Copyright Law In India|last=Dalmia|first=Vijay Pal|date=14 December 2017|website=Mondaq}}</ref>\n\n===Duration===<!-- This section is linked from [[Little Nemo]] -->\n{{Main|Copyright term |List of countries' copyright length }}\n[[File:Tom Bell's graph showing extension of U.S. copyright term over time.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Expansion of U.S. copyright law (currently based on the date of creation or publication).]]\nCopyright subsists for a variety of lengths in different jurisdictions. The length of the term can depend on several factors, including the type of work (e.g. musical composition, novel), whether the work has been [[Publication|published]], and whether the work was created by an individual or a corporation. In most of the world, the default length of copyright is the life of the author plus either 50 or 70 years. In the United States, the term for most existing works is a fixed number of years after the date of creation or publication. Under most countries' laws (for example, the United States<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode |17 |305 }}</ref> and the United Kingdom<ref>The Duration of Copyright and Rights in Performances Regulations 1995, [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19953297_en_3.htm part II], Amendments of the UK Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988</ref>), copyrights expire at the end of the calendar year in which they would otherwise expire.\n\nThe length and requirements for copyright duration are subject to change by legislation, and since the early 20th century there have been a number of adjustments made in various countries, which can make determining the duration of a given copyright somewhat difficult. For example, the United States used to require copyrights to be renewed after 28 years to stay in force, and formerly required a copyright notice upon first publication to gain coverage. In Italy and France, there were post-wartime extensions that could increase the term by approximately 6 years in Italy and up to about 14 in France. Many countries have extended the length of their copyright terms (sometimes retroactively). International treaties establish minimum terms for copyrights, but individual countries may enforce longer terms than those.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Copyright: Sacred Text, Technology, and the DMCA |last=Nimmer |first=David |publisher=Kluwer Law International |year=2003 |isbn=978-90-411-8876-2 |oclc=50606064 |page=63 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=RYfRCNxgPO4C |via=Google Books }}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, all books and other works published before 1923 have expired copyrights and are in the public domain.<ref>\"[http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States].\", ''[[Cornell University]]''.</ref> In addition, works published before 1964 that did not have their copyrights renewed 28 years after first publication year also are in the public domain. Hirtle points out that the great majority of these works (including 93% of the books) were not renewed after 28 years and are in the public domain.<ref>See Peter B. Hirtle, \"Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States 1 January 2015\" [https://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm online at footnote 8] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226112433/http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm |date=26 February 2015 }}</ref> Books originally published outside the US by non-Americans are exempt from this renewal requirement, if they are still under copyright in their home country.\n\nBut if the intended exploitation of the work includes publication (or distribution of derivative work, such as a film based on a book protected by copyright) outside the U.S., the terms of copyright around the world must be considered. If the author has been dead more than 70 years, the work is in the public domain in most, but not all, countries.\n\nIn 1998, the length of a copyright in the United States was increased by 20 years under the Copyright Term Extension Act. This legislation was strongly promoted by corporations which had valuable copyrights which otherwise would have expired, and has been the subject of substantial criticism on this point.<ref>Lawrence Lessig, ''Copyright's First Amendment'', 48 UCLA L. Rev. 1057, 1065 (2001)</ref>\n\n== Limitations and exceptions ==\n{{Main|Limitations and exceptions to copyright }}\n\nIn many jurisdictions, copyright law makes exceptions to these restrictions when the work is copied for the purpose of commentary or other related uses. United States copyright law does not cover names, titles, short phrases or listings (such as ingredients, recipes, labels, or formulas).<ref>[http://copyright.gov/circs/circ34.pdf (2012) ''Copyright Protection Not Available for Names, Titles, or Short Phrases'' U.S. Copyright Office]</ref> However, there are protections available for those areas copyright does not cover, such as [[trademark]]s and [[patent]]s.\n\n=== Idea\u2013expression dichotomy and the merger doctrine ===\n{{Main|Idea\u2013expression divide }}\n\nThe idea\u2013expression divide differentiates between ideas and expression, and states that copyright protects only the original expression of ideas, and not the ideas themselves. This principle, first clarified in the 1879 case of [[Baker v. Selden]], has since been codified by the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] at 17 U.S.C. \u00a7&nbsp;102(b).\n\n=== The first-sale doctrine and exhaustion of rights ===\n\n{{Main|First-sale doctrine |Exhaustion of rights }}\nCopyright law does not restrict the owner of a copy from reselling legitimately obtained copies of copyrighted works, provided that those copies were originally produced by or with the permission of the copyright holder. It is therefore legal, for example, to resell a copyrighted book or [[compact disc|CD]]. In the United States this is known as the [[first-sale doctrine]], and was established by the [[court]]s to clarify the legality of reselling books in second-hand [[bookstore]]s.\n\nSome countries may have [[parallel importation]] restrictions that allow the copyright holder to control the [[aftermarket (merchandise)|aftermarket]]. This may mean for example that a copy of a book that does not infringe copyright in the country where it was printed does infringe copyright in a country into which it is imported for retailing. The first-sale doctrine is known as [[exhaustion of rights]] in other countries and is a principle which also applies, though somewhat differently, to [[patent]] and [[trademark]] rights. It is important to note that the first-sale doctrine permits the transfer of the particular legitimate copy involved. It does not permit making or distributing additional copies.\n\nIn ''[[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.]]'',<ref>{{cite web |title=John Wiley & Sons Inc. v. Kirtsaeng |url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-697_d1o2.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702033641/https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-697_d1o2.pdf |archivedate=2 July 2017  }}</ref> in 2013, the [[United States Supreme Court]] held in a 6\u20133 decision that the first-sale doctrine applies to goods manufactured abroad with the copyright owner's permission and then imported into the US without such permission. The case involved a plaintiff who imported Asian editions of textbooks that had been manufactured abroad with the publisher-plaintiff's permission. The defendant, without permission from the publisher, imported the textbooks and resold on eBay. The Supreme Court's holding severely limits the ability of copyright holders to prevent such importation.\n\nIn addition, copyright, in most cases, does not prohibit one from acts such as modifying, defacing, or destroying his or her own legitimately obtained copy of a copyrighted work, so long as duplication is not involved. However, in countries that implement [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]], a copyright holder can in some cases successfully prevent the mutilation or destruction of a work that is publicly visible.\n\n=== Fair use and fair dealing ===\n{{Main|Fair use |Fair dealing }}\nCopyright does not prohibit all copying or replication. In the United States, the [[fair use]] doctrine, codified by the [[United States Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act of 1976]] as 17 U.S.C. Section 107, permits some copying and distribution without permission of the copyright holder or payment to same. The statute does not clearly define fair use, but instead gives four non-exclusive factors to consider in a fair use analysis. Those factors are:\n# the purpose and character of one's use\n# the nature of the copyrighted work\n# what amount and proportion of the whole work was taken, and\n# the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/107.html |title=US CODE: Title 17,107. Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use |publisher=.law.cornell.edu |date=20 May 2009 |access-date=16 June 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]] and many other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, a similar notion of fair dealing was established by the [[court]]s or through [[legislation]]. The concept is sometimes not well defined; however in [[Canada]], private copying for personal use has been expressly permitted by statute since 1999. In ''[[Alberta (Education) v. Canadian Copyright Licensing Agency (Access Copyright)]]'', 2012 SCC 37, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] concluded that limited copying for educational purposes could also be justified under the fair dealing exemption. In Australia, the fair dealing exceptions under the ''Copyright Act 1968'' (Cth) are a limited set of circumstances under which copyrighted material can be legally copied or adapted without the copyright holder's consent. Fair dealing uses are research and study; review and critique; news reportage and the giving of professional advice (i.e. [[legal advice]]). Under current [[Law of Australia|Australian law]], although it is still a breach of copyright to copy, reproduce or adapt copyright material for personal or private use without permission from the copyright owner, owners of a legitimate copy are permitted to \"format shift\" that work from one medium to another for personal, private use, or to \"time shift\" a broadcast work for later, once and only once, viewing or listening. Other technical exemptions from infringement may also apply, such as the temporary reproduction of a work in machine readable form for a computer.\n\nIn the United States the AHRA ([[Audio Home Recording Act]] Codified in Section 10, 1992) prohibits action against consumers making noncommercial recordings of music, in return for royalties on both media and devices plus mandatory copy-control mechanisms on recorders.\n\n:''Section 1008. Prohibition on certain infringement actions''\n\n:''No action may be brought under this title alleging infringement of copyright based on the manufacture, importation, or distribution of a digital audio recording device, a digital audio recording medium, an analog recording device, or an analog recording medium, or based on the noncommercial use by a consumer of such a device or medium for making digital musical recordings or analog musical recordings.''\n\nLater acts amended US Copyright law so that for certain purposes making 10 copies or more is construed to be commercial, but there is no general rule permitting such copying. Indeed, making one complete copy of a work, or in many cases using a portion of it, for commercial purposes will not be considered fair use. The [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] prohibits the manufacture, importation, or distribution of devices whose intended use, or only significant commercial use, is to bypass an access or copy control put in place by a copyright owner.<ref name=\"Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights\" /> An appellate court has held that fair use is not a defense to engaging in such distribution.\n\n[[Copyright law of the European Union|EU copyright laws]] recognise the right of EU member states to implement some national exceptions to copyright. Examples of those exceptions are:\n*photographic reproductions on paper or any similar medium of works (excluding sheet music) provided that the rightholders receives fair compensation,\n*reproduction made by libraries, educational establishments, museums or archives, which are non-commercial\n*archival reproductions of broadcasts,\n*uses for the benefit of people with a disability,\n*for demonstration or repair of equipment,\n*for non-commercial research or private study\n*when used in [[parody]]\n\n=== Accessible copies ===\nIt is legal in several countries including the United Kingdom and the United States to produce alternative versions (for example, in large print or braille) of a copyrighted work to provide improved access to a work for blind and visually impaired people without permission from the copyright holder.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#121 |title=Chapter 1 \u2013 Circular 92 \u2013 U.S. Copyright Office |website=www.copyright.gov }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rnib.org.uk/xpedio/groups/public/documents/publicwebsite/public_cvipsact2002.hcsp |title=Copyright (Visually Impaired Persons) Act 2002 comes into force |publisher=Royal National Institute of Blind People |date=1 January 2011 |access-date=11 August 2016 }}</ref>\n\n== {{Anchor |Transfer and licensing, and assignment }} Transfer, assignment and licensing ==\n{{See also|Collective rights management |Extended collective licensing |Compulsory license |Copyright transfer agreement }}\n[[File:All rights reserved.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|DVD: [[All Rights Reserved]].]]\nA copyright, or aspects of it (e.g. reproduction alone, all but moral rights), may be assigned or transferred from one party to another.<ref name=\"WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights\">{{Cite book |title=WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&as_brr=3 |isbn=978-92-805-1271-7 |year=2004 |publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization |page=15 }}</ref> For example, a musician who records an album will often sign an agreement with a record company in which the musician agrees to transfer all copyright in the recordings in exchange for royalties and other considerations. The creator (and original copyright holder) benefits, or expects to, from production and marketing capabilities far beyond those of the author. In the digital age of music, music may be copied and distributed at minimal cost through the [[Internet]]; however, the [[record industry]] attempts to provide promotion and marketing for the artist and their work so it can reach a much larger audience. A copyright holder need not transfer all rights completely, though many publishers will insist. Some of the rights may be transferred, or else the copyright holder may grant another party a non-exclusive license to copy or distribute the work in a particular region or for a specified period of time.\n\nA transfer or licence may have to meet particular formal requirements in order to be effective,<ref name=\"WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights(2)\">{{Cite book |title=WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&as_brr=3 |page=8 |isbn=978-92-805-1271-7 |year=2004 |publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization }}</ref> for example under the Australian [[Copyright law of Australia#Copyright Act 1968|Copyright Act 1968]] the copyright itself must be expressly transferred in writing. Under the U.S. Copyright Act, a transfer of ownership in copyright must be memorialized in a writing signed by the transferor. For that purpose, ownership in copyright includes exclusive licenses of rights. Thus exclusive licenses, to be effective, must be granted in a written instrument signed by the grantor. No special form of transfer or grant is required. A simple document that identifies the work involved and the rights being granted is sufficient. Non-exclusive grants (often called non-exclusive licenses) need not be in writing under [[Law of the United States|U.S. law]]. They can be oral or even implied by the behavior of the parties. Transfers of copyright ownership, including exclusive licenses, may and should be recorded in the U.S. Copyright Office. (Information on recording transfers is available on the Office's web site.) While recording is not required to make the grant effective, it offers important benefits, much like those obtained by recording a deed in a [[real estate]] transaction.\n\nCopyright may also be [[license]]d.<ref name=\"WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights\" /> Some jurisdictions may provide that certain classes of copyrighted works be made available under a prescribed [[statutory license]] (e.g. musical works in the United States used for radio broadcast or performance). This is also called a [[compulsory license]], because under this scheme, anyone who wishes to copy a covered work does not need the permission of the copyright holder, but instead merely files the proper notice and pays a set fee established by statute (or by an agency decision under statutory guidance) for every copy made.<ref name=\"WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights(3)\">{{Cite book |title=WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&as_brr=3 |page=16 |isbn=978-92-805-1271-7 |year=2004 |publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization }}</ref> Failure to follow the proper procedures would place the copier at risk of an infringement suit. Because of the difficulty of following every individual work, [[copyright collective]]s or [[collecting societies]] and [[performance rights organisation|performing rights organizations]] (such as [[ASCAP]], [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]], and [[SESAC]]) have been formed to collect royalties for hundreds (thousands and more) works at once. Though this market solution bypasses the statutory license, the availability of the statutory fee still helps dictate the price per work collective rights organizations charge, driving it down to what avoidance of procedural hassle would justify.\n\n=== Free licenses ===\nCopyright licenses known as ''open'' or [[free license]]s seek to grant several rights to licensees, either for a fee or not. ''Free'' in this context is not as much of a reference to price as it is to freedom. What constitutes free licensing has been characterised in a number of similar definitions, including by order of longevity the [[Free Software Definition]], the [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]], the [[Open Source Definition]] and the [[Definition of Free Cultural Works]]. Further refinements to these definitions have resulted in categories such as [[copyleft]] and [[permissive license|permissive]]. Common examples of free licences are the [[GNU General Public License]], [[BSD license]]s and some [[Creative Commons licenses]].\n\nFounded in 2001 by [[James Boyle (academic)|James Boyle]], [[Lawrence Lessig]], and [[Hal Abelson]], the [[Creative Commons]] (CC) is a non-profit organization<ref name=\"CC\">{{Cite web |url=https://creativecommons.org/ |title=Creative Commons Website |website=creativecommons.org |access-date=24 October 2011 }}</ref> which aims to facilitate the legal sharing of creative works. To this end, the organization provides a number of generic copyright license options to the public, [[gratis versus libre|gratis]]. These licenses allow copyright holders to define conditions under which others may use a work and to specify what types of use are acceptable.<ref name=\"CC\" />\n\nTerms of use have traditionally been negotiated on an individual basis between copyright holder and potential licensee. Therefore, a general CC license outlining which rights the copyright holder is willing to waive enables the general public to use such works more freely. Six general types of CC licenses are available (although some of them are not properly free per the above definitions and per Creative Commons' own advice). These are based upon copyright-holder stipulations such as whether he or she is willing to allow modifications to the work, whether he or she permits the creation of derivative works and whether he or she is willing to permit commercial use of the work.<ref name=\"Rubin\">Rubin, R. E. (2010) 'Foundations of Library and Information Science: Third Edition', Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc., New York, p. 341</ref> {{As of |2009 }} approximately 130 million individuals had received such licenses.<ref name=\"Rubin\" />\n\n== Criticism ==\n{{Main |Criticism of copyright }}\nSome sources are critical of particular aspects of the copyright system. This is known as a debate over [[copynorms]]. Particularly to the background of uploading content to internet platforms and the digital exchange of original work, there is discussion about the [[copyright aspects of downloading and streaming]], the [[copyright aspects of hyperlinking and framing]].\n\nConcerns are often couched in the language of [[digital rights]], digital freedom, [[database right]]s, [[open data]] or [[censorship]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://edri.org/press-release-meps-ignore-expert-advice-and-vote-for-mass-internet-censorship/ |title=MEPs ignore expert advice and vote for mass internet censorship |publisher=European Digital Rights |access-date=24 June 2018 |date=20 June 2018 }}</ref> Discussions include ''[[Free Culture (book)|Free Culture]]'', a 2004 book by [[Lawrence Lessig]]. Lessig coined the term [[permission culture]] to describe a worst-case system. ''[[Good Copy Bad Copy]]'' (documentary) and [[RiP!: A Remix Manifesto]], discuss copyright. Some suggest an [[alternative compensation system]]. In Europe consumers are acting up against the raising costs of music, film and books, and as a result [[Pirate Party|Pirate Parties]] have been created. Some groups reject copyright altogether, taking an [[anti-copyright]] stance. The perceived inability to enforce copyright online leads some to advocate [[Crypto-anarchism|ignoring legal statutes when on the web]].\n\n== Public domain ==\n{{Main |Public domain }}\nCopyright, like other [[intellectual property rights]], is subject to a statutorily determined term. Once the term of a copyright has expired, the formerly copyrighted work enters the public domain and may be used or exploited by anyone without obtaining permission, and normally without payment. However, in [[paying public domain]] regimes the user may still have to pay royalties to the state or to an authors' association. Courts in common law countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, have rejected the doctrine of a [[common law copyright]]. Public domain works should not be confused with works that are publicly available. Works posted in the [[internet]], for example, are publicly available, but are not generally in the public domain. Copying such works may therefore violate the author's copyright.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal |Law }}\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Adelphi Charter]]\n* [[Artificial scarcity]]\n* [[Authors' rights]] and [[related rights]], roughly equivalent concepts in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries\n* [[Conflict of laws]]\n* [[Copyleft]]\n* [[Copyright Alliance]]\n* [[Copyright in architecture in the United States]]\n* [[Copyright on the content of patents and in the context of patent prosecution]]\n* [[Copyright for Creativity]]\n* [[Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market]] (European Union)\n* [[Copyright infringement]]\n* [[Copyright on religious works]]\n* [[Copyright Remedy Clarification Act]] (CRCA)\n* [[Creative Barcode]]\n* [[Digital rights management]]\n* [[Digital watermarking]]\n* [[Entertainment law]]\n* [[Freedom of panorama]]\n* [[Information literacies]]\n* [[Intellectual property protection of typefaces]]\n* [[List of Copyright Acts]]\n* [[List of copyright case law]]\n* [[Literary property]]\n* [[Model release]]\n* [[Criticism of copyright]]\n* [[Paracopyright]]\n* [[Photography and the law]]\n* [[Pirate Party]]\n* [[Printing patent]], a precursor to copyright\n* [[Private copying levy]]\n* [[Production music]]\n* [[Rent-seeking]]\n* [[Reproduction fees]]\n* [[Samizdat]]\n* [[Software copyright]]\n* [[Threshold pledge system]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book\n  |author=Dowd, Raymond J.\n  |title=Copyright Litigation Handbook\n  |publisher=Thomson West |edition=1st |year=2006\n  |isbn=0-314-96279-4\n  |ref=Dowd, Litigation handbook\n}}\n* Ellis, Sara R.

Forty-four years after [[Ferdinand Magellan]] discovered the Philippines and died in the [[Battle of Mactan]] during his Spanish expedition to circumnavivate the globe, the Spaniards successfully annexed and colonized the islands during the reign of [[Philip II of Spain]], whose name remained attached to the country. The Spanish colonial period ended with the [[Philippine Revolution]] in 1898, which marked the beginning of the [[History of the Philippines (1898\u20131946)|American colonization]] of the Philippines.\n\n==Spanish colonization==\n===Background===\n{{See also|History of the Philippines (900\u20131565)#Spanish explorations (1521\u20131565)}}\nThe Spaniards had been exploring the Philippines since the early 16th century. [[Ferdinand Magellan]], a Portuguese navigator in charge of a Spanish expedition to circumnavigate the globe, attempted to conquer the islands but was defeated and killed by the forces of [[Lapu-Lapu]] at the [[Battle of Mactan]]. In 1543, [[Ruy L\u00f3pez de Villalobos]] arrived at the islands of Leyte and Samar and named them ''Las Islas Filipinas'' in honor of [[Philip II of Spain]], at the time [[Prince of Asturias]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Scott|1985|p=51}}.</ref> Philip became [[King of Spain]] on January 16, 1556, when his father, Charles I of Spain (who also reigned as [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]]), abdicated the Spanish throne.

In 1570, Legazpi sent his grandson, [[Juan de Salcedo]], who had arrived from Mexico in 1567, to [[Mindoro]] to punish the Muslim [[Moro people|Moro]] pirates who had been plundering Panay villages. Salcedo also destroyed forts on the islands of [[Ilin Island|Ilin]] and [[Lubang Island|Lubang]], respectively South and Northwest of Mindoro.<ref name=\"halili2004\" />{{rp|1=[https://books.google.com/books?id=gUt5v8ET4QYC&pg=PA79 79]}}\n[[File:DoctrinaChristianaEspanolaYTagala8-9.jpg|thumb|Pages of the ''Doctrina Christiana'', [[First book of the Spanish Philippines|an early Christian book]] in Spanish and Tagalog.

Trade between Spain and the Philippines was via the [[Pacific Ocean]] to Mexico ([[Manila]] to [[Acapulco]]), and then across the [[Caribbean Sea]] and [[Atlantic Ocean]] to Spain ([[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]] to [[Cadiz|C\u00e1diz]]). Manila became a major center of trade in Asia between the 17th and 18th centuries. All sorts of products from [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Brunei]], the Moluccas and even [[India]] were sent to Manila to be sold for silver 8-Real coins which came aboard the galleons from Acapulco. These goods, including [[silk]], [[porcelain]], [[spice]]s, [[lacquerware]] and textile products were then sent to Acapulco and from there to other parts of [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]], [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]] and Europe.\n\n===Spanish colonists===\nThe European population in the archipelago steadily grew although indigenous Filipinos remained the majority.

[[Moro people|Moros]] from western Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago also raided the coastal Christian areas of Luzon and the Visayas and occasionally captured men and women to be sold as slaves.\n\nSome Japanese ships visited the Philippines in the 1570s in order to export Japanese [[silver]] and import Philippine [[gold]]. Later, increasing imports of silver from New World sources resulted in Japanese exports to the Philippines shifting from silver to consumer goods. In the 1570s, the Spanish traders were troubled to some extent by Japanese pirates, but peaceful trading relations were established between the Philippines and Japan by 1590.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schottenhammer|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GSA_AaRdgioC&pg=PA151 151]}}.</ref> Japan's [[kampaku]] ([[regent]]), [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], demanded unsuccessfully on several occasions that the Philippines submit to Japan's [[suzerainty]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Yu-Jose|1999|p=https://books.google.com/books?id=kbWv-pZy5H0C&pg=PA1 1}}.</ref>\n\nOn February 8, 1597, King [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], near the end of his 42-year reign, issued a [[Decree|Royal Cedula]] instructing [[Francisco de Tello de Guzm\u00e1n]], then [[Governor-General of the Philippines]] to fulfill the laws of tributes and to provide for restitution of ill-gotten taxes taken from indigenous Filipinos.

The first task was the reduction, or relocation of indigenous Filipinos into settlements. The earliest political system used during the ''conquista'' period was the ''encomienda'' system, which resembled the feudal system in medieval Europe. The conquistadores, friars and native nobles were granted estates, in exchange for their services to the King, and were given the privilege to collect tribute from its inhabitants. In return, the person granted the ''encomienda'', known as an ''encomendero'', was tasked to provide military protection to the inhabitants, justice and governance. In times of war, the ''encomendero'' was duty bound to provide soldiers for the King, in particular, for the complete defense of the colony from invaders such as the [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] and [[Chinese people|Chinese]]. The ''encomienda'' system was abused by ''encomenderos'' and by 1700 was largely replaced by administrative provinces, each headed by an ''alcalde mayor'' (provincial governor)<ref>.{{harvnb|Abinales|Amoroso|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xiOQdEzgP9kC&pg=PA55 55]}}.</ref> The most prominent feature of Spanish cities was the plaza, a central area for town activities such as the fiesta, and where government buildings, the church, a market area and other infrastructures were located.

The Governor-General was commonly a ''[[Peninsulars|peninsular Spaniard]]'', a Spaniard born in Spain, to ensure loyalty of the colony to the crown or tiara.\n\n====Provincial government====\n{{main article|Provinces of the Philippines}}\nOn the local level, heading the pacified provinces (''alcaldia''), was the provincial governor (''alcalde mayor''). The unpacified military zones (''corregimiento''), such as [[Mariveles, Bataan|Mariveles]] and [[Mindoro]], were headed by the ''corregidores''. City governments (''ayuntamientos''), were also headed by an ''alcalde mayor''. ''Alcalde mayors'' and ''corregidores'' exercised multiple prerogatives as judge, inspector of ''encomiendas'', chief of police, tribute collector, capitan-general of the province, and even vice-regal patron. His annual salary ranged from P300 to P2000 before 1847 and P1500 to P1600 after 1847. This could be augmented through the special privilege of \"''indulto de commercio''\" where all people were forced to do business with him. The ''alcalde mayor'' was usually an ''Insulares'' (Spaniard born in the Philippines). In the 19th century, the ''Peninsulares'' began to displace the ''Insulares'' which resulted in the political unrests of 1872, notably the [[1872 Cavite mutiny]] and the [[Gomburza]] executions.\n\n==== Municipal government ====\nThe ''pueblo'' or town is headed by the ''[[Gobernadorcillo]]'' or little governor. Among his administrative duties were the preparation of the tribute list (''padron''), recruitment and distribution of men for draft labor, communal public work and military conscription (quinto), postal clerk and judge in minor civil suits. He intervened in all administrative cases pertaining to his town: lands, justice, finance and the municipal police. His annual salary, however, was only P24 but he was exempted from taxation. Any native or Chinese mestizo, 25 years old, proficient in oral or written Spanish and has been a ''cabeza de barangay'' of 4 years can be a ''gobernadorcillo''. \n\nAny member of the [[Principal\u00eda]], who speaks or who has knowledge of the Spanish language and has been a ''[[Cabeza de Barangay]]'' of 4 years can be a ''[[Gobernadorcillo]]''. Among those prominent is [[Emilio Aguinaldo]], a [[chinese mestizo]],<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard Chu|title=Chinese and Chinese Mestizos of Manila: Family, Identity, and Culture, 1860s-1930s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PRewCQAAQBAJ|year=2010|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-474-2685-1|page=[https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=PRewCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA284&dq=%22emilio+aguinaldo%22+%22chinese+mestizo%22 284]}}</ref> and who was the ''Gobernadorcillo'' of Cavite El Viejo (now [[Kawit, Cavite|Kawit]]).

He was responsible for peace and order, recruited men for communal public works, and collecting the barrio's taxes. ''Cabezas'' should be literate in Spanish and have good moral character and property. Cabezas who served for 25 years were exempted from forced labor.\n\nIn addition, this is where the sentiment heard as, \"Mi Barrio\", first came from.\n[[File:Old Cebu.jpg|thumb|Old view of a street in [[Cebu City|Cebu]]|left|alt=]]\n\n==== The ''Residencia'' and the ''Visita'' ====\nTo check the abuse of power of royal officials, two ancient Castilian institutions were brought to the Philippines: the ''Residencia'', dating back to the 5th century, and the ''Visita'', which differed from the ''residencia'' in that it was conducted clandestinely by a ''visitador-general'' sent from Spain and might occur anytime within the official's term, without any previous notice. ''Visitas'' could be specific or general.\n\n====Maura law====\nThe legal foundation for municipal governments in the country was laid with the promulgation of the [[Maura Law]] on May 19, 1893. Named after its author, [[Antonio Maura|Don Antonio Maura]], the Spanish [[Overseas Ministry (Spain)|Minister of Colonies]] at the time, the law reorganized town governments in the Philippines with the aim of making them more effective and autonomous. This law created the municipal organization that was later adopted, revised, and further strengthened by the American and Filipino governments that succeeded Spanish.\n\n===Economy===\n[[File:Spanish Galleon.jpg|thumb|A sketch of a [[Manila galleon]] used during the [[Manila galleon|Manila-Acapulco Trade]]]]\n[[File:Malaca\u00f1ang Palace 1940.jpg|thumb|[[Malaca\u00f1ang Palace]] was the seat of the colonial government of the Philippines.|alt=]]\n[[File:Puerta de Santa Lucia gate of Intramuros in front of Augustinian convento, Manila, Philippines \u2013 1899.jpg|thumb|Puerta de Santa Lucia gate is one of the gates of the walled city ([[Intramuros]]), Manila.|alt=]]\n\n==== Manila-Acapulco galleon trade ====\nThe [[Manila Galleon|Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade]] was the main source of income for the colony during its early years.

Composed of leading men in local and foreign scholarships and training grants in agriculture and established an academy of design. It was also credited to the carabao ban of 1782, the formation of the silversmiths and gold beaters guild and the construction of the first paper mill in the Philippines in 1825.

The Dutch and British bitterly opposed them because they saw the company as a direct attack on their Asian trade. It also faced the hostility of the traders of the Galleon trade (see above) who saw it as competition.

It took various forms such as the building and repairing of roads and bridges, construction of public buildings and churches, cutting timber in the forest, working in shipyards and serving as soldiers in military expeditions. People who rendered the forced labor was called \u201cpolistas\u201d. He could be exempted by paying the \u201cfalla\u201d which is a sum of money.

Although the Spanish forces consisted of just two Manila galleons and a [[galley]] with crews composed mainly of Filipino volunteers, against three separate Dutch squadrons, totaling eighteen ships, the Dutch squadrons were severely defeated in all fronts by the Spanish-Filipino forces, forcing the Dutch to abandon their plans for an invasion of the Philippines.\n\nOn June 6, 1647, Dutch vessels were sighted near Mariveles Island. In spite of the preparations, the Spanish had only one galleon (the ''San Diego'') and two galleys ready to engage the enemy. The Dutch had twelve major vessels.\n\nOn June 12, the armada attacked the Spanish port of [[Cavite City|Cavite]]. The battle lasted eight hours, and the Spanish believed they had done much damage to the enemy flagship and the other vessels. The Spanish ships were not badly damaged and casualties were low. However, nearly every roof in the Spanish settlement was damaged by cannon fire, which particularly concentrated on the cathedral. On June 19, the armada was split, with six ships sailing for the shipyard of [[Mindoro]] and the other six remaining in [[Manila Bay]]. The Dutch next attacked [[Pampanga]], where they captured the fortified monastery, taking prisoners and executing almost 200 Filipino defenders.

At the time, [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Kingdom of France|France]] were at war, in what was later called the [[Seven Years' War]]. France, suffering a series of setbacks, successfully negotiated a treaty with Spain known as the [[Family Compact]] which was signed on 15 August 1761.

Anda intercepted and redirected the Manila galleon trade to prevent further captures by the British. The failure of the British to consolidate their position led to troop desertions and a breakdown of command unity which left the British forces paralysed and in an increasingly precarious position.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fish|2003|p=158}}</ref>\n\nThe Seven Years' War was ended by the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Peace of Paris]] signed on 10 February 1763. At the time of signing the treaty, the signatories were not aware that the Manila was under British occupation and was being administered as a British colony. Consequently, no specific provision was made for the Philippines. Instead they fell under the general provision that all other lands not otherwise provided for be returned to the Spanish Crown.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tracy|1995|p=109}}</ref>\n\n==Resistance against Spanish rule==\n[[File:Jaro (Phil) Reception-Taft.jpg|thumb|Town of Jaro, Iloilo, Philippines|alt=]]\nSpanish colonial rule of the Philippines was constantly threatened by indigenous rebellions and invasions from the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]], [[Greater China|Chinese]], [[Japan]]ese and [[British Empire|British]]. The previously dominant groups resisted Spanish rule, refusing to pay Spanish taxes and rejecting Spanish excesses.  All were defeated by the Spanish and their Filipino allies by 1597. In many areas, the Spanish left indigenous groups to administer their own affairs but under Spanish overlordship.\n\n===Early resistance===\n{{main article|Philippine revolts against Spain|Spanish-Moro Conflict}}\nThe Resistance against Spain did not immediately cease upon the conquest of the Austronesian cities. After [[Rajah patis|Rajah Patis]] of [[Cebu]], some indigenous Filipino nobles resisted Spanish rule. Throughout their rule, the Spanish government had faced [[Philippine revolts against Spain|numerous revolts]] across the country, most of which they had successfully quelled while others were won through agreements with the leaders of the revolts themselves.\n\nDuring the British occupation of Manila (1762\u20131764), [[Diego Silang]] was appointed by them as governor of [[Ilocos]] and after his assassination by fellow Filipinos, his wife [[Gabriela Silang|Gabriela]] continued to lead the Ilocanos in the fight against Spanish rule.

The industrialization of Europe created great demands for raw materials from the colonies, bringing with it investment and wealth, although this was very unevenly distributed. Governor-General [[Jos\u00e9 Basco y Vargas|Basco]] had opened the Philippines to this trade. Previously, the Philippines was seen as a trading post for international trade but in the nineteenth century it was developed both as a source of raw materials and as a market for manufactured goods.\n\nThe economy of the Philippines rose rapidly and its local industries developed to satisfy the rising demands of an industrializing Europe. Its most marketable products in the European and world markets included sugar from Negros, Manila hemp or abaca from Eastern Philippines, and tobacco from Ilocos. A small flow of European immigrants came with the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] <nowiki/>which cut the travel time between Europe and the Philippines by half. New ideas about government and society, which the friars and colonial authorities found dangerous, quickly found their way into the Philippines, notably through the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]], who along with others, spread the ideals of the [[American Revolution|American]], [[French Revolution|French]] and other revolutions, including [[Liberalism and radicalism in Spain|Spanish liberalism]].\n\n===Rise of Filipino nationalism===\n{{main article|Filipino nationalism}}\n[[File:Filipino mestizo couple, early 1800s.jpg|left|thumb|Tagalog Filipino mestizo, early 1800s.

Many Filipinos prospered. Everyday Filipinos also benefited from the new economy with the rapid increase in demand for labor and availability of business opportunities. Some Europeans immigrated to the Philippines to join the wealth wagon, among them Jacobo Zobel, patriarch of today's [[Zobel de Ayala family]] and prominent figure in the rise of Filipino nationalism. Their scions studied in the best universities of Europe where they learned the ideals of liberty from the French and American Revolutions. The new economy gave rise to a new middle class in the Philippines, usually not ethnic Filipinos.\n\n[[File:Manila Cathedral before the 1880 earthquake.jpg|thumb|[[Manila Cathedral]]]]\nIn the mid-19th century, the Suez Canal was opened which made the Philippines easier to reach from Spain. The small increase of ''[[Peninsulares]]'' from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] threatened the secularization of the [[Roman Catholicism in the Philippines|Philippine churches]]. In state affairs, the ''[[Criollo (people)|Criollos]]'', known locally as ''Insulares'' (lit. \"islanders\"). were displaced from government positions by the ''Peninsulares'', whom the ''Insulares'' regarded as foreigners. The ''Insulares'' had become increasingly Filipino and called themselves ''Los hijos del pa\u00eds'' (lit. \"sons of the country\"). Among the early proponents of Filipino nationalism were the ''Insulares'' Padre [[Pedro Pel\u00e1ez]], [[archbishop of Manila]], who fought for the secularization of Philippine churches and expulsion of the friars; Padre [[Jos\u00e9 Burgos]] whose execution influenced the national hero [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]]; and [[Joaqu\u00edn Pardo de Tavera]] who fought for retention of government positions by natives, regardless of race. In retaliation to the rise of Filipino nationalism, the friars called the ''Indios'' (possibly referring to ''Insulares'' and ''[[Filipino mestizo|mestizos]]'' as well) indolent and unfit for government and church positions.  In response, the ''Insulares'' came out with ''Indios agraviados'', a manifesto defending the Filipino against discriminatory remarks.  The tension between the ''Insulares'' and ''Peninsulares'' erupted into the failed revolts of [[Novales]] and the [[Cavite Mutiny]] of 1872 which resulted to the deportation of prominent Filipino nationalists to the [[Marianas]] and Europe who would continue the fight for liberty through the Propaganda Movement. The Cavite Mutiny implicated the priests [[Mariano G\u00f3mez]], [[Jos\u00e9 Burgos]], and [[Jacinto Zamora]] (see [[Gomburza]]) whose executions would influence the subversive activities of the next generation of Filipino nationalists, Jos\u00e9 Rizal, who then dedicated his novel, ''[[El filibusterismo]]'' to these priests.\n[[File:San-Juan-de-Letran.jpg|thumb|Colegio San Juan de Letran, [[Intramuros]] Manila (ca. 1880)|alt=]]\n\n===Rise of Spanish liberalism===\n{{see also|Liberalism and radicalism in Spain}}\nAfter the Liberals won the [[Spanish Revolution of 1868]], [[Carlos Mar\u00eda de la Torre y Nava Cerrada|Carlos Mar\u00eda de la Torre]] was sent to the Philippines to serve as governor-general (1869\u20131871).

The Western World was quickly changing and sought less political control from the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nThe first Filipino Masonic lodge was ''Revoluccion''. It was established by [[Graciano Lopez Jaena]] in Barcelona and was recognized in April 1889. It did not last long after he resigned from being its worshipful master on November 29, 1889.\n\nIn December 1889, [[Marcelo H. del Pilar]] established, with the help of [[Julio A. Llorente|Julio Llorente]], the ''Solidaridad'' in Madrid. Its first worshipful master was Llorente. A short time later, the ''Solidaridad'' grew. Some its members included [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]], [[Pedro Serrano Laktaw]], [[Baldomero Roxas]], and [[Galicano Apacible]].\n\nIn 1891, Del Pilar sent Laktaw to the Philippines to establish a Masonic lodge. Laktaw established on January 6, 1892, the ''Nilad'', the first Masonic lodge in the Philippines. It is estimated that there were 35 masonic lodges in the Philippines in 1893 of which nine were in Manila. The first [[Filipina|Filipino]] freemason was [[Rosario Villaruel]]. Trinidad and Josefa Rizal, [[Marina Dizon]], [[Romualda Lanuza]], [[Purificacion Leyva]], and many others join the masonic lodge.\n\nFreemasonry was important during the time of the [[Philippine Revolution]]. It pushed the reform movement and carried out the propaganda work. In the Philippines, many of those who pushed for a revolution were member of freemasonry like [[Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio]]. In fact, the organization used by Bonifacio in establishing the [[Katipunan]] was derived from the Masonic society.

The community grew with the next generation of [[Ilustrados]] studying in European universities.  They allied themselves with Spanish liberals, notably Spanish senator [[Miguel Morayta Sagrario]], and founded the newspaper ''[[La Solidaridad]]''.\n\nAmong the reformers was [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]], who wrote two novels while in Europe.  His novels were considered{{By whom|date=August 2013}} the most influential of the Illustrados' writings causing further unrest in the islands, particularly the founding of the [[Katipunan]].  A rivalry developed between himself and [[Marcelo H. del Pilar]] for the leadership of ''La Solidaridad'' and the reform movement in Europe.

Trade between Spain and the Philippines was via the [[Pacific Ocean]] to Mexico ([[Manila]] to [[Acapulco]]), and then across the [[Caribbean Sea]] and [[Atlantic Ocean]] to Spain ([[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]] to [[Cadiz|C\u00e1diz]]). Manila became a major center of trade in Asia between the 17th and 18th centuries. All sorts of products from [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Brunei]], the Moluccas and even [[India]] were sent to Manila to be sold for silver 8-Real coins which came aboard the galleons from Acapulco. These goods, including [[silk]], [[porcelain]], [[spice]]s, [[lacquerware]] and textile products were then sent to Acapulco and from there to other parts of [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]], [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]] and Europe.\n\n===Spanish colonists===\nThe European population in the archipelago steadily grew although indigenous Filipinos remained the majority.

The first task was the reduction, or relocation of indigenous Filipinos into settlements. The earliest political system used during the ''conquista'' period was the ''encomienda'' system, which resembled the feudal system in medieval Europe. The conquistadores, friars and native nobles were granted estates, in exchange for their services to the King, and were given the privilege to collect tribute from its inhabitants. In return, the person granted the ''encomienda'', known as an ''encomendero'', was tasked to provide military protection to the inhabitants, justice and governance. In times of war, the ''encomendero'' was duty bound to provide soldiers for the King, in particular, for the complete defense of the colony from invaders such as the [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] and [[Chinese people|Chinese]]. The ''encomienda'' system was abused by ''encomenderos'' and by 1700 was largely replaced by administrative provinces, each headed by an ''alcalde mayor'' (provincial governor)<ref>.{{harvnb|Abinales|Amoroso|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xiOQdEzgP9kC&pg=PA55 55]}}.</ref> The most prominent feature of Spanish cities was the plaza, a central area for town activities such as the fiesta, and where government buildings, the church, a market area and other infrastructures were located. Residential areas lay around the plaza. During the ''conquista'', the first task of colonization was the reduction, or relocation of the indigenous population into settlements surrounding the plaza.\n\n====National government====\n[[File:Chopsticks in the Philippines.jpg|thumb|239x239px|Chinese settlers in the Philippines]]\n[[File:A Hydrographical and Chorographical Chart of the Philippine Islands WDL10089.png|thumb|''[[Carta Hydrographica y Chorographica de las Yslas Filipinas]]'' (1734)|alt=1734 Philippine map]]\nOn the national level or social class, the [[King of Spain]], via his [[Council of the Indies]] (''Consejo de las Indias''), governed through his representative in the Philippines, the [[Governor-General of the Philippines]] (''Gobernador y Capit\u00e1n General''). With the seat of power in [[Intramuros, Manila]], the Governor-General was given several duties: head of the supreme court, the ''[[Royal Audiencia of Manila]]''; Commander-in-chief of the army and navy, and the economic planner of the country.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} All executive power of the local government stemmed from him and as [[Viceroy|regal patron]], he had the authority to supervise mission work and oversee [[ecclesiastical]] appointments. His yearly salary was 40,000 pesos. The Governor-General was commonly a ''[[Peninsulars|peninsular Spaniard]]'', a Spaniard born in Spain, to ensure loyalty of the colony to the crown or tiara.\n\n====Provincial government====\n{{main article|Provinces of the Philippines}}\nOn the local level, heading the pacified provinces (''alcaldia''), was the provincial governor (''alcalde mayor''). The unpacified military zones (''corregimiento''), such as [[Mariveles, Bataan|Mariveles]] and [[Mindoro]], were headed by the ''corregidores''. City governments (''ayuntamientos''), were also headed by an ''alcalde mayor''. ''Alcalde mayors'' and ''corregidores'' exercised multiple prerogatives as judge, inspector of ''encomiendas'', chief of police, tribute collector, capitan-general of the province, and even vice-regal patron. His annual salary ranged from P300 to P2000 before 1847 and P1500 to P1600 after 1847. This could be augmented through the special privilege of \"''indulto de commercio''\" where all people were forced to do business with him. The ''alcalde mayor'' was usually an ''Insulares'' (Spaniard born in the Philippines). In the 19th century, the ''Peninsulares'' began to displace the ''Insulares'' which resulted in the political unrests of 1872, notably the [[1872 Cavite mutiny]] and the [[Gomburza]] executions.\n\n==== Municipal government ====\nThe ''pueblo'' or town is headed by the ''[[Gobernadorcillo]]'' or little governor. Among his administrative duties were the preparation of the tribute list (''padron''), recruitment and distribution of men for draft labor, communal public work and military conscription (quinto), postal clerk and judge in minor civil suits. He intervened in all administrative cases pertaining to his town: lands, justice, finance and the municipal police. His annual salary, however, was only P24 but he was exempted from taxation. Any native or Chinese mestizo, 25 years old, proficient in oral or written Spanish and has been a ''cabeza de barangay'' of 4 years can be a ''gobernadorcillo''. \n\nAny member of the [[Principal\u00eda]], who speaks or who has knowledge of the Spanish language and has been a ''[[Cabeza de Barangay]]'' of 4 years can be a ''[[Gobernadorcillo]]''.

He was responsible for peace and order, recruited men for communal public works, and collecting the barrio's taxes. ''Cabezas'' should be literate in Spanish and have good moral character and property. Cabezas who served for 25 years were exempted from forced labor.\n\nIn addition, this is where the sentiment heard as, \"Mi Barrio\", first came from.\n[[File:Old Cebu.jpg|thumb|Old view of a street in [[Cebu City|Cebu]]|left|alt=]]\n\n==== The ''Residencia'' and the ''Visita'' ====\nTo check the abuse of power of royal officials, two ancient Castilian institutions were brought to the Philippines: the ''Residencia'', dating back to the 5th century, and the ''Visita'', which differed from the ''residencia'' in that it was conducted clandestinely by a ''visitador-general'' sent from Spain and might occur anytime within the official's term, without any previous notice. ''Visitas'' could be specific or general.\n\n====Maura law====\nThe legal foundation for municipal governments in the country was laid with the promulgation of the [[Maura Law]] on May 19, 1893. Named after its author, [[Antonio Maura|Don Antonio Maura]], the Spanish [[Overseas Ministry (Spain)|Minister of Colonies]] at the time, the law reorganized town governments in the Philippines with the aim of making them more effective and autonomous.

In spite of the preparations, the Spanish had only one galleon (the ''San Diego'') and two galleys ready to engage the enemy. The Dutch had twelve major vessels.\n\nOn June 12, the armada attacked the Spanish port of [[Cavite City|Cavite]]. The battle lasted eight hours, and the Spanish believed they had done much damage to the enemy flagship and the other vessels. The Spanish ships were not badly damaged and casualties were low. However, nearly every roof in the Spanish settlement was damaged by cannon fire, which particularly concentrated on the cathedral. On June 19, the armada was split, with six ships sailing for the shipyard of [[Mindoro]] and the other six remaining in [[Manila Bay]]. The Dutch next attacked [[Pampanga]], where they captured the fortified monastery, taking prisoners and executing almost 200 Filipino defenders. The governor ordered solemn funeral rites for the dead and payments to their widows and orphans.<ref name=\"recollect\">De Jesus, Luis & De Santa Theresa, Diego. \"Recollect Missions, 1646\u20131660\", in {{cite book |editor1-last=BLAIR |editor1-first=Emma Helen |editor1-link=Emma Helen Blair |editor2-last=Robertson |editor2-first=James Alexander |editor2-link=James Alexander Robertson |others=Historical introduction and additional notes by [[Edward Gaylord Bourne]] |translator=[[Henry B.

Several revolts did break out, the most serious being in the village of Lind\u00e1o. There most of the Spaniards were killed, and the survivors were forced to flee in a small river boat to Butu\u00e1n.

At the time, [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Kingdom of France|France]] were at war, in what was later called the [[Seven Years' War]]. France, suffering a series of setbacks, successfully negotiated a treaty with Spain known as the [[Family Compact]] which was signed on 15 August 1761. By an ancillary secret convention, Spain was committed to making preparations for war against Britain.<ref name=\"Nicholas Tracy 1995, p9\">{{Harvnb|Tracy|1995|p=9}}</ref>\n\nThe early success at Manila did not enable the British to control the Philippines. Spanish-Filipino forces (made up mostly of Filipinos) kept the British confined to Manila.

He led Spanish-Filipino forces that kept the British confined to Manila and sabotaged or crushed British fomented revolts. Anda intercepted and redirected the Manila galleon trade to prevent further captures by the British. The failure of the British to consolidate their position led to troop desertions and a breakdown of command unity which left the British forces paralysed and in an increasingly precarious position.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fish|2003|p=158}}</ref>\n\nThe Seven Years' War was ended by the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Peace of Paris]] signed on 10 February 1763. At the time of signing the treaty, the signatories were not aware that the Manila was under British occupation and was being administered as a British colony. Consequently, no specific provision was made for the Philippines. Instead they fell under the general provision that all other lands not otherwise provided for be returned to the Spanish Crown.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tracy|1995|p=109}}</ref>\n\n==Resistance against Spanish rule==\n[[File:Jaro (Phil) Reception-Taft.jpg|thumb|Town of Jaro, Iloilo, Philippines|alt=]]\nSpanish colonial rule of the Philippines was constantly threatened by indigenous rebellions and invasions from the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]], [[Greater China|Chinese]], [[Japan]]ese and [[British Empire|British]]. The previously dominant groups resisted Spanish rule, refusing to pay Spanish taxes and rejecting Spanish excesses.  All were defeated by the Spanish and their Filipino allies by 1597. In many areas, the Spanish left indigenous groups to administer their own affairs but under Spanish overlordship.\n\n===Early resistance===\n{{main article|Philippine revolts against Spain|Spanish-Moro Conflict}}\nThe Resistance against Spain did not immediately cease upon the conquest of the Austronesian cities. After [[Rajah patis|Rajah Patis]] of [[Cebu]], some indigenous Filipino nobles resisted Spanish rule. Throughout their rule, the Spanish government had faced [[Philippine revolts against Spain|numerous revolts]] across the country, most of which they had successfully quelled while others were won through agreements with the leaders of the revolts themselves.\n\nDuring the British occupation of Manila (1762\u20131764), [[Diego Silang]] was appointed by them as governor of [[Ilocos]] and after his assassination by fellow Filipinos, his wife [[Gabriela Silang|Gabriela]] continued to lead the Ilocanos in the fight against Spanish rule. Resistance against Spanish rule was regional in character, based on ethnolinguistic groups.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sagmit|Sagmit-Mendoza|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SIq_FvJUr40C&pg=RA5\u2013PT27 127]}}.</ref>\n\nHispanization did not spread to the mountainous center of northern Luzon, nor to the inland communities of Mindanao.\n\n===The opening of the Philippines to world trade===\n[[File:Plaza Moraga Manila Philippines.jpg|thumb|Old photo of [[Manila]]'s streets with [[Bahay na bato]] edifices and [[kalesa]], Filipino style of architecture and transportation developed during the Spanish era|alt=]]\nIn [[Europe]], the [[Industrial Revolution]] spread from [[Great Britain]] during the period known as the [[Victorian Age]]. The industrialization of Europe created great demands for raw materials from the colonies, bringing with it investment and wealth, although this was very unevenly distributed. Governor-General [[Jos\u00e9 Basco y Vargas|Basco]] had opened the Philippines to this trade. Previously, the Philippines was seen as a trading post for international trade but in the nineteenth century it was developed both as a source of raw materials and as a market for manufactured goods.\n\nThe economy of the Philippines rose rapidly and its local industries developed to satisfy the rising demands of an industrializing Europe. Its most marketable products in the European and world markets included sugar from Negros, Manila hemp or abaca from Eastern Philippines, and tobacco from Ilocos. A small flow of European immigrants came with the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] <nowiki/>which cut the travel time between Europe and the Philippines by half. New ideas about government and society, which the friars and colonial authorities found dangerous, quickly found their way into the Philippines, notably through the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]], who along with others, spread the ideals of the [[American Revolution|American]], [[French Revolution|French]] and other revolutions, including [[Liberalism and radicalism in Spain|Spanish liberalism]].\n\n===Rise of Filipino nationalism===\n{{main article|Filipino nationalism}}\n[[File:Filipino mestizo couple, early 1800s.jpg|left|thumb|Tagalog Filipino mestizo, early 1800s.

La Insular Cigar Factory is one of the most popular.|alt=]]\nThe development of the Philippines as a source of raw materials and as a market for European manufactures created much local wealth.  Many Filipinos prospered. Everyday Filipinos also benefited from the new economy with the rapid increase in demand for labor and availability of business opportunities. Some Europeans immigrated to the Philippines to join the wealth wagon, among them Jacobo Zobel, patriarch of today's [[Zobel de Ayala family]] and prominent figure in the rise of Filipino nationalism. Their scions studied in the best universities of Europe where they learned the ideals of liberty from the French and American Revolutions. The new economy gave rise to a new middle class in the Philippines, usually not ethnic Filipinos.\n\n[[File:Manila Cathedral before the 1880 earthquake.jpg|thumb|[[Manila Cathedral]]]]\nIn the mid-19th century, the Suez Canal was opened which made the Philippines easier to reach from Spain. The small increase of ''[[Peninsulares]]'' from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] threatened the secularization of the [[Roman Catholicism in the Philippines|Philippine churches]]. In state affairs, the ''[[Criollo (people)|Criollos]]'', known locally as ''Insulares'' (lit. \"islanders\"). were displaced from government positions by the ''Peninsulares'', whom the ''Insulares'' regarded as foreigners. The ''Insulares'' had become increasingly Filipino and called themselves ''Los hijos del pa\u00eds'' (lit. \"sons of the country\"). Among the early proponents of Filipino nationalism were the ''Insulares'' Padre [[Pedro Pel\u00e1ez]], [[archbishop of Manila]], who fought for the secularization of Philippine churches and expulsion of the friars; Padre [[Jos\u00e9 Burgos]] whose execution influenced the national hero [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]]; and [[Joaqu\u00edn Pardo de Tavera]] who fought for retention of government positions by natives, regardless of race. In retaliation to the rise of Filipino nationalism, the friars called the ''Indios'' (possibly referring to ''Insulares'' and ''[[Filipino mestizo|mestizos]]'' as well) indolent and unfit for government and church positions.  In response, the ''Insulares'' came out with ''Indios agraviados'', a manifesto defending the Filipino against discriminatory remarks.  The tension between the ''Insulares'' and ''Peninsulares'' erupted into the failed revolts of [[Novales]] and the [[Cavite Mutiny]] of 1872 which resulted to the deportation of prominent Filipino nationalists to the [[Marianas]] and Europe who would continue the fight for liberty through the Propaganda Movement. The Cavite Mutiny implicated the priests [[Mariano G\u00f3mez]], [[Jos\u00e9 Burgos]], and [[Jacinto Zamora]] (see [[Gomburza]]) whose executions would influence the subversive activities of the next generation of Filipino nationalists, Jos\u00e9 Rizal, who then dedicated his novel, ''[[El filibusterismo]]'' to these priests.\n[[File:San-Juan-de-Letran.jpg|thumb|Colegio San Juan de Letran, [[Intramuros]] Manila (ca. 1880)|alt=]]\n\n===Rise of Spanish liberalism===\n{{see also|Liberalism and radicalism in Spain}}\nAfter the Liberals won the [[Spanish Revolution of 1868]], [[Carlos Mar\u00eda de la Torre y Nava Cerrada|Carlos Mar\u00eda de la Torre]] was sent to the Philippines to serve as governor-general (1869\u20131871).

The Western World was quickly changing and sought less political control from the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nThe first Filipino Masonic lodge was ''Revoluccion''. It was established by [[Graciano Lopez Jaena]] in Barcelona and was recognized in April 1889. It did not last long after he resigned from being its worshipful master on November 29, 1889.\n\nIn December 1889, [[Marcelo H. del Pilar]] established, with the help of [[Julio A. Llorente|Julio Llorente]], the ''Solidaridad'' in Madrid. Its first worshipful master was Llorente. A short time later, the ''Solidaridad'' grew. Some its members included [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]], [[Pedro Serrano Laktaw]], [[Baldomero Roxas]], and [[Galicano Apacible]].\n\nIn 1891, Del Pilar sent Laktaw to the Philippines to establish a Masonic lodge. Laktaw established on January 6, 1892, the ''Nilad'', the first Masonic lodge in the Philippines. It is estimated that there were 35 masonic lodges in the Philippines in 1893 of which nine were in Manila. The first [[Filipina|Filipino]] freemason was [[Rosario Villaruel]]. Trinidad and Josefa Rizal, [[Marina Dizon]], [[Romualda Lanuza]], [[Purificacion Leyva]], and many others join the masonic lodge.\n\nFreemasonry was important during the time of the [[Philippine Revolution]]. It pushed the reform movement and carried out the propaganda work. In the Philippines, many of those who pushed for a revolution were member of freemasonry like [[Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio]]. In fact, the organization used by Bonifacio in establishing the [[Katipunan]] was derived from the Masonic society. It may be said that joining masonry was one activity that both the reformists and the Katipuneros shared.\n\n===Illustrados, Rizal and Katipunan===\n[[File:La Liga.jpg|thumb|Filipino ''Ilustrados'' in Spain|alt=]]\n[[File:Katipuneros.jpg|left|thumb|Katipuneros|alt=]]\nThe mass deportation of nationalists to the Marianas and Europe in 1872 led to a Filipino expatriate community of reformers in Europe.  The community grew with the next generation of [[Ilustrados]] studying in European universities.  They allied themselves with Spanish liberals, notably Spanish senator [[Miguel Morayta Sagrario]], and founded the newspaper ''[[La Solidaridad]]''.\n\nAmong the reformers was [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]], who wrote two novels while in Europe.  His novels were considered{{By whom|date=August 2013}} the most influential of the Illustrados' writings causing further unrest in the islands, particularly the founding of the [[Katipunan]].  A rivalry developed between himself and [[Marcelo H. del Pilar]] for the leadership of ''La Solidaridad'' and the reform movement in Europe.  Majority of the expatriates supported the leadership of del Pilar.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n[[File:Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio.jpg|thumb|[[Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio]], Father of the [[Philippine Revolution]]]]\n\nRizal then returned to the Philippines to organize [[La Liga Filipina]] and bring the reform movement to Philippine soil.  He was arrested just a few days after founding the league.  In 1892, Radical members of the La Liga Filipina, which included Bonifacio and [[Deodato Arellano]], founded the ''Kataastaasan Kagalanggalang Katipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan'' (KKK), called simply the ''[[Katipunan]]'', which had the objective of the Philippines seceding from the Spanish Empire.\n\n==The Philippine Revolution==\n{{main article|Philippine Revolution}}\n[[File:Emilio Aguinaldo (ca. 1898).jpg|left|thumb|[[Emilio Aguinaldo]], the first Philippine president|alt=]]\nBy 1896 the Katipunan had a membership by the thousands. That same year, the existence of the Katipunan was discovered by the colonial authorities. In late August Katipuneros gathered in Caloocan and declared the start of the revolution.

Until the early 1600s, a bourse was not exactly a stock exchange in its modern sense. With the founding of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) in 1602 and the rise of Dutch [[capital market]]s in the early 17th century, the 'old' bourse (a place to trade [[Commodity market|commodities]], [[government bond|government]] and [[municipal bond]]s) found a new purpose \u2013 a formal exchange that specialize in creating and sustaining [[secondary market]]s in the [[Security (finance)|securities]] (such as [[corporate bond|bond]]s and [[share (finance)|share]]s of [[stock]]) issued by [[corporation]]s \u2013 or a stock exchange as we know it today.<ref>Neal, Larry (2005). \"Venture Shares of the Dutch East India Company\", in Goetzmann & Rouwenhorst (eds.), Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 165\u2013175</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101773977 |title=Is Asia the next financial center of the world? |publisher=[[CNBC.com]] |last=Murphy |first=Richard McGill |date=1 Jul 2014 |accessdate=11 Mar 2017}}</ref>|group=\"note\"}} where [[stockbroker]]s and [[stock trader|traders]] can buy and sell [[share (finance)|share]]s of [[stock]], [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], and other [[security (finance)|securities]]. Many large companies have their stocks listed on a stock exchange. This makes the stock more liquid and thus more attractive to many investors. The exchange may also act as a guarantor of settlement. Other stocks may be traded \"over the counter\" (OTC), that is, through a dealer. Some large companies will have their stock listed on more than one exchange in different countries, so as to attract international investors.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ibm.com/investor/faq/item/stock-exchanges.wss | title=IBM Investor relations - FAQ &#124; On what stock exchanges is IBM listed ? |publisher=[[IBM]]}}</ref>\n\nStock exchanges may also cover other types of securities, such as fixed interest securities (bonds) or (less frequently) derivatives which are more likely to be traded OTC.\n\nTrade in stock markets means the transfer (in exchange for money) of a stock or security from a seller to a buyer. This requires these two parties to agree on a price. [[Equity (finance)|Equities]] (stocks or shares) confer an ownership interest in a particular company.\n\nParticipants in the stock market range from small individual [[stock investors]] to larger investors, who can be based anywhere in the world, and may include [[bank]]s, [[insurance]] companies, [[pension fund]]s and [[hedge fund]]s. Their buy or sell orders may be executed on their behalf by a stock exchange [[trader (finance)|trader]].\n\nSome exchanges are physical locations where transactions are carried out on a trading floor, by a method known as [[open outcry]]. This method is used in some stock exchanges and [[commodities exchange]]s, and involves traders shouting bid and offer prices. The other type of stock exchange has a network of computers where trades are made electronically. An example of such an exchange is the [[NASDAQ]].\n\nA potential buyer ''bids'' a specific price for a stock, and a potential seller ''asks'' a specific price for the same stock. Buying or selling ''at the market'' means you will accept ''any'' ask price or bid price for the stock. When the bid and ask prices match, a sale takes place, on a first-come, first-served basis if there are multiple bidders at a given price.\n\nThe purpose of a stock exchange is to facilitate the exchange of securities between buyers and sellers, thus providing a [[marketplace]]. The exchanges provide real-time trading information on the listed securities, facilitating [[price discovery]].\n\nThe [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE) is a physical exchange, with a [[hybrid market]] for placing orders electronically from any location as well as on the [[trading floor]]. Orders executed on the trading floor enter by way of exchange members and flow down to a [[floor broker]], who submits the order electronically to the floor trading post for the Designated [[market maker]] (\"DMM\") for that stock to trade the order. The DMM's job is to maintain a two-sided market, making orders to buy and sell the security when there are no other buyers or sellers. If a [[bid\u2013ask spread]] exists, no trade immediately takes place \u2013 in this case the DMM may use their own resources (money or stock) to close the difference. Once a trade has been made, the details are reported on the \"tape\" and sent back to the brokerage firm, which then notifies the investor who placed the order. Computers play an important role, especially for [[program trading]].\n\nThe [[NASDAQ]] is an electronic exchange, where all of the trading is done over a computer network. The process is similar to the New York Stock Exchange. One or more NASDAQ [[market maker]]s will always provide a bid and ask price at which they will always purchase or sell 'their' stock.\n\nThe [[Paris Bourse]], now part of [[Euronext]], is an order-driven, electronic stock exchange. It was automated in the late 1980s. Prior to the 1980s, it consisted of an open outcry exchange. [[Stockbroker]]s met on the trading floor of the Palais Brongniart. In 1986, the [[CATS (trading system)|CATS trading system]] was introduced, and the [[order matching system]] was fully automated.\n\nPeople trading stock will prefer to trade on the most popular exchange since this gives the largest number of potential counter parties (buyers for a seller, sellers for a buyer) and probably the best price. However, there have always been alternatives such as brokers trying to bring parties together to trade outside the exchange. Some third markets that were popular are [[Instinet]], and later Island and Archipelago (the latter two have since been acquired by Nasdaq and NYSE, respectively). One advantage is that this avoids the [[Commission (remuneration)|commissions]] of the exchange. However, it also has problems such as [[adverse selection]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/ubs-goldman-wean-away-trade-from-nyse-nasdaq/articleshow/726712.cms | title=UBS, Goldman wean away trade from NYSE, Nasdaq | work=[[The Economic Times]] | date=December 6, 2006}}</ref> Financial regulators have probed [[dark pool]]s.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-12/off-exchange-stock-trading-reaches-two-year-high-in-u-s- | title=Dark Pools Take Larger Share of Trades Amid SEC Scrutiny|publisher=[[Bloomberg News]] | first=Sam | last=Mamudi | date=June 13, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.ft.com/content/50428000-220d-11e4-9d4a-00144feabdc0 | title=Financial regulators probe dark pools | work=[[Financial Times]] | date=September 15, 2014 | url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n\n==Market participant==\n[[Market participant]]s include individual retail investors, [[institutional investor]]s (e.g., [[pension fund]]s, [[insurance companies]], [[mutual fund]]s, [[index fund]]s, [[exchange-traded fund]]s, [[hedge fund]]s, investor groups, banks and various other [[financial institution]]s), and also publicly traded corporations trading in their own shares. [[Robo-advisor]]s, which automate investment for individuals are also major participants.\n\n===Demographics of market participation ===\n==== Indirect vs. Direct Investment ====\nIndirect investment involves owning shares indirectly, such as via a mutual fund or exchange traded fund. Direct investment involves direct ownership of shares.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://investorjunkie.com/investing/direct-vs-indirect-shares/ | title=What's the Difference Between Direct and Indirect Shares? | publisher=InvestorJunkie}}</ref>\n\nDirect ownership of stock by individuals rose slightly from 17.8% in 1992 to 17.9% in 2007, with the median value of these holdings rising from $14,778 to $17,000.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite report |date=September 1995 |title=Statistical Abstract of the United States: 1995 |url=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/1995/compendia/statab/115ed.html |publisher=United States Census Bureau |page=513 |accessdate=2015-12-17}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite report |date=August 2011 |title=Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2012 |url=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2011/compendia/statab/131ed.html?cssp=SERP |publisher=United States Census Bureau |page=730  |accessdate=2015-12-17}}</ref> Indirect participation in the form of retirement accounts rose from 39.3% in 1992 to 52.6% in 2007, with the median value of these accounts more than doubling from $22,000 to $45,000 in that time.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" />  Rydqvist, Spizman, and [[Ilya Strebulaev|Strebulaev]] attribute the differential growth in direct and indirect holdings to differences in the way each are taxed in the United States. Investments in pension funds and 401ks, the two most common vehicles of indirect participation, are taxed only when funds are withdrawn from the accounts. Conversely, the money used to directly purchase stock is subject to taxation as are any dividends or capital gains they generate for the holder. In this way the current tax code incentivizes individuals to invest indirectly.<ref>{{Cite journal | title=Government Policy and Ownership of Financial Assets | date=2013-01-01 | first = Kristian | last=Rydqvist | first2=Joshua | last2=Spizman | first3=Ilya A. | last3=Strebulaev | ssrn=1428442}}</ref>\n\n==== Participation by income and wealth strata ====\nRates of participation and the value of holdings differs significantly across strata of income.

As of 2011 the national rate of direct participation was 19.6%, for white households the participation rate was 24.5%, for black households it was 6.4% and for Hispanic households it was 4.3%. Indirect participation in the form of 401k ownership shows a similar pattern with a national participation rate of 42.1%, a rate of 46.4% for white households, 31.7% for black households, and 25.8% for Hispanic households. Households headed by married couples participated at rates above the national averages with 25.6% participating directly and 53.4% participating indirectly through a retirement account. 14.7% of households headed by men participated in the market directly and 33.4% owned stock through a retirement account. 12.6% of female headed households directly owned stock and 28.7% owned stock indirectly.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====Determinants and possible explanations of stock market participation====\nIn a 2003 paper by Vissing-J\u00f8rgensen attempts to explain disproportionate rates of participation along wealth and income groups as a function of fixed costs associated with investing. Her research concludes that a fixed cost of $200 per year is sufficient to explain why nearly half of all U.S. households do not participate in the market.<ref>{{Cite journal |first=Annette |last=Vissing-J\u00f8rgensen |title=Perspectives on Behavioral Finance: Does 'Irrationality' Disappear with Wealth?

Behavioral economists Harrison Hong, Jeffrey Kubik and Jeremy Stein suggest that sociability and participation rates of communities have a statistically significant impact on an individual's decision to participate in the market. Their research indicates that social individuals living in states with higher than average participation rates are 5% more likely to participate than individuals that do not share those characteristics.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Social Interaction and Stock-Market Participation | last=Hong | first=Harrison | date=February 2004 | journal=The Journal of Finance | volume=59 | pages=137\u2013163 | doi = 10.1111/j.1540-6261.2004.00629.x | pmid= | url=https://surface.syr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1060&context=ecn}}</ref> This phenomenon also explained in cost terms.

From predominantly Dutch-speaking cities of the [[Low Countries]] (like [[Bruges]] and [[Antwerp]]), the term 'beurs' spread to other European states where it was corrupted into 'bourse', 'borsa', 'bolsa', 'b\u00f6rse', etc.]]\n\n===Early history===\nIn 12th-century France, the ''courretiers de change'' were concerned with managing and regulating the debts of agricultural communities on behalf of the banks. Because these men also traded with debts, they could be called the first [[broker]]s. A common misbelief {{Citation needed|reason=|date=March 2017}} is that, in late 13th-century [[Bruges]], commodity traders gathered inside the house of a man called ''Van der Beurze'', and in 1409 they became the \"Brugse Beurse\", institutionalizing what had been, until then, an informal meeting, but actually, the family Van der Beurze had a building in [[Antwerp]] where those gatherings occurred;<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.belgiumview.com/belgiumview/tl1/view0002205.php4 | title=16de eeuwse traditionele bak- en zandsteenarchitectuur Oude Beurs Antwerpen 1 (centrum) / Antwerp foto | publisher=Belgiumview.com}}</ref>  the Van der Beurze had Antwerp, as most of the merchants of that period, as their primary place for trading. The idea quickly spread around [[Flanders]] and neighboring countries and \"Beurzen\" soon opened in [[Ghent]] and [[Rotterdam]].\n\nIn the middle of the 13th century, [[Venice|Venetian]] bankers began to trade in government securities. In 1351 the Venetian government outlawed spreading rumors intended to lower the price of government funds. Bankers in [[Pisa]], [[Verona]], [[Genoa]] and [[Florence]] also began trading in government securities during the 14th century. This was only possible because these were independent city-states not ruled by a duke but a council of influential citizens. Italian companies were also the first to issue shares. Companies in England and the Low Countries followed in the 16th century.  Around this time, a [[joint stock company]]--one whose stock is owned jointly by the shareholders--emerged and became important for colonization of what Europeans called the \"New World\".<ref>[Ralph Dahrendorft, Class and Class Conflict in Industrial Society (Stanford, CA:  Stanford University Press, 1959)]</ref>\n\n===Birth of formal stock markets===\n{{See also|Economic history of the Dutch Republic|Financial history of the Dutch Republic|Dutch East India Company}}\n[[File:Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie spiegelretourschip Amsterdam replica.jpg|180px|right|thumb|Replica of an [[East Indiaman]] of the [[Dutch East India Company]]/[[United East Indies Company]] (VOC).

But the field marks are much the same. The first stock exchange was, inadvertently, a laboratory in which new human reactions were revealed. By the same token, the New York Stock Exchange is also a sociological test tube, forever contributing to the human species' self-understanding.

Within the [[Communist countries]], the spectrum of socialism ranged from the quasi-market, quasi-[[syndicalist]] system of Yugoslavia to the centralized [[totalitarianism]] of neighboring Albania. One time I asked Professor [[Ludwig von Mises|von Mises]], the great expert on the economics of socialism, at what point on this spectrum of statism would he designate a country as \"socialist\" or not. At that time, I wasn't sure that any definite criterion existed to make that sort of clear-cut judgment. And so I was pleasantly surprised at the clarity and decisiveness of Mises's answer. \"A stock market,\" he answered promptly. \"A stock market is crucial to the existence of [[capitalism]] and [[private property]]. For it means that there is a functioning market in the exchange of private titles to the [[means of production]]. There can be no genuine private ownership of capital without a stock market: there can be no true socialism if such a market is allowed to exist.\"\n|200px||[[Murray Rothbard]], in \u201cMaking Economic Sense\u201d (2006)<ref>[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard, Murray]]: ''Making Economic Sense'', 2nd edition.

The [[liquidity]] that an exchange affords the investors enables their holders to quickly and easily sell securities. This is an attractive feature of investing in stocks, compared to other less liquid investments such as [[property]] and other immoveable assets.\n\nHistory has shown that the price of [[stock]]s and other assets is an important part of the dynamics of economic activity, and can influence or be an indicator of social mood. An economy where the stock market is on the rise is considered to be an up-and-coming economy. The stock market is often considered the primary indicator of a country's economic strength and development.<ref>Mahipal Singh, 2011, {{ISBN|9788182055193}}, April 2011</ref>\n\nRising share prices, for instance, tend to be associated with increased business investment and vice versa. Share prices also affect the wealth of households and their consumption. Therefore, [[central bank]]s tend to keep an eye on the control and behavior of the stock market and, in general, on the smooth operation of [[financial system]] functions. Financial stability is the [[wikt:raison d'\u00eatre|raison d'\u00eatre]] of central banks.<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2009/wp0970.pdf | title=Financial Stability Frameworks and the Role of Central Banks: Lessons from the Crisis | first=Erlend Walter | last=Nier | publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]]}}</ref>\n\nExchanges also act as the clearinghouse for each transaction, meaning that they collect and deliver the shares, and guarantee payment to the seller of a security.

(Note that such events are predicted to occur strictly by [[randomness]], although very rarely.) It seems also to be true more generally that many price movements (beyond those which are predicted to occur 'randomly') are ''not'' occasioned by new information; a study of the fifty largest one-day share price movements in the United States in the post-war period seems to confirm this.<ref name=\"Cutler, D. Poterba, J. & Summers, L. 1991 520\u2013546\"/>\n\nA 'soft' EMH has emerged which does not require that prices remain at or near equilibrium, but only that market participants cannot ''systematically'' profit from any momentary '[[market anomaly]]'. Moreover, while EMH predicts that all price movement (in the absence of change in fundamental information) is random (i.e. non-trending){{dubious|date=November 2019}}, many studies have shown a marked tendency for the stock market to trend over time periods of weeks or longer. Various explanations for such large and apparently non-random price movements have been promulgated. For instance, some research has shown that changes in estimated risk, and the use of certain strategies, such as stop-loss limits and [[value at risk]] limits, ''theoretically could'' cause financial markets to overreact. But the best explanation seems to be that the distribution of stock market prices is non-Gaussian<ref>{{cite web|title=OpenStax CNX|url=http://cnx.org/contents/9UMcK-Dv@2/Non-Gaussian-Observations|website=cnx.org|publisher=Rice University|accessdate=22 February 2017}}</ref> (in which case EMH, in any of its current forms, would not be strictly applicable).<ref>{{cite book | year = 2006 |author1=Mandelbrot, Benoit  |author2=Hudson, Richard L.   |lastauthoramp=yes | title = The Misbehavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Financial Turbulence |edition=annot.| publisher = Basic Books | isbn = 978-0-465-04357-6 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | year = 2008 | author = Taleb, Nassim Nicholas | title = Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets | edition = 2nd | publisher = Random House | isbn = 978-1-4000-6793-0 | url = https://archive.org/details/fooledbyrandomne00tale }}</ref>\n\nOther research has shown that psychological factors may result in ''exaggerated'' (statistically anomalous) stock price movements (contrary to EMH which assumes such behaviors 'cancel out'). Psychological research has demonstrated that people are predisposed to 'seeing' patterns, and often will perceive a pattern in what is, in fact, just ''noise'', e.g. seeing familiar shapes in clouds or ink blots. In the present context this means that a succession of good news items about a company may lead investors to overreact positively, driving the price up. A period of good returns also boosts the investors' self-confidence, reducing their (psychological) risk threshold.<ref>{{cite journal | year = 1974|author1=Tversky, A.  |author2=Kahneman, D.  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal = Science | volume = 185 | pages = 1124\u20131131| title = Judgement under uncertainty: heuristics and biases | doi = 10.1126/science.185.4157.1124 | pmid = 17835457 | issue = 4157}}</ref>\n\nAnother phenomenon\u2014also from psychology\u2014that works against an [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] assessment is ''[[Groupthink|group thinking]]''. As social animals, it is not easy to stick to an opinion that differs markedly from that of a majority of the group. An example with which one may be familiar is the reluctance to enter a restaurant that is empty; people generally prefer to have their opinion validated by those of others in the group.\n\nIn one paper the authors draw an analogy with [[gambling]].<ref>{{cite journal |authorlink=Stephen Morris (game theorist) |first=Stephen |last=Morris |first2=Hyun Song |last2=Shin |title=Risk management with interdependent choice |journal=Oxford Review of Economic Policy |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=52\u201362 |year=1999 |doi=10.1093/oxrep/15.3.52 |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~smorris/Published/paper_21_Risk_Management.pdf |citeseerx=10.1.1.381.3080 }}</ref> In normal times the market behaves like a game of [[roulette]]; the probabilities are known and largely independent of the investment decisions of the different players. In times of market stress, however, the game becomes more like poker (herding behavior takes over). The players now must give heavy weight to the psychology of other investors and how they are likely to react psychologically.\n\nIn the period running up to the 1987 crash, less than 1 percent{{fact|date=November 2019}} of the analysts' recommendations had been to sell (and even during the 2000\u20132002 [[Bear Market|bear market]], the average did not rise above 5%). In the run-up to 2000, the media amplified the general euphoria, with reports of rapidly rising share prices and the notion that large sums of money could be quickly earned in the so-called [[new economy]] stock market.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nStock markets play an essential role in growing industries that ultimately affect the economy through transferring available funds from units that have excess funds (savings) to those who are suffering from funds deficit (borrowings) (Padhi and Naik, 2012). In other words, capital markets facilitate funds movement between the above-mentioned units. This process leads to the enhancement of available financial resources which in turn affects the economic growth positively. Moreover, both economic and financial theories argue that stock prices are affected by macroeconomic trends.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nMany different academic researchers have stated that companies with low P/E ratios and smaller-sized companies have a tendency to outperform the market. Research has shown that mid-sized companies outperform large cap companies, and smaller companies have higher returns historically.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\n=== Irrational behavior ===\nSometimes, the market seems to react irrationally to economic or financial news, even if that news is likely to have no real effect on the fundamental value of securities itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/2006211-why-the-market-doesnt-care-where-you-think-it-should-go|title=Why The Market Doesn't Care Where You Think It Should Go|author=David Fabian|date=February 9, 2014|work=Seeking Alpha|accessdate=August 14, 2015}}</ref> However, this market behaviour may be more apparent than real, since often such news was anticipated, and a counter reaction may occur if the news is better (or worse) than expected.  Therefore, the stock market may be swayed in either direction by press releases, rumors, [[euphoria]] and [[mass panic]].\n\nOver the short-term, stocks and other securities can be battered or buoyed by any number of fast market-changing events, making the stock market behavior difficult to predict. Emotions can drive prices up and down, people are generally not as rational as they think, and the reasons for buying and selling are generally accepted.\n\nBehaviorists argue that investors often behave ''irrationally'' when making investment decisions thereby incorrectly pricing securities, which causes market inefficiencies, which, in turn, are opportunities to make money.<ref>Sergey Perminov, ''Trendocracy and Stock Market Manipulations'' (2008, {{ISBN|978-1-4357-5244-3}}).</ref>  However, the whole notion of EMH is that these non-rational reactions to information cancel out, leaving the prices of stocks rationally determined.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average biggest gain in one day was 936.42 points or 11%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/27166818 |title=News Headlines |publisher=Cnbc.com |date=October 13, 2008 |accessdate=March 5, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Crashes===\n{{Main|Stock market crash}}\n{{further|List of stock market crashes and bear markets}}\n[[Image:IE Real SandP Prices, Earnings, and Dividends 1871-2006.png|380px|right|thumb|[[Robert Shiller]]'s plot of the S&P Composite Real Price Index, Earnings, Dividends, and Interest Rates, from ''[[Irrational Exuberance (book)|Irrational Exuberance]]'', 2d ed.<ref name=\"IE2\">{{cite book |last=Shiller |first=Robert |title=Irrational Exuberance |edition=2nd|year=2005 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-691-12335-6 |title-link=Irrational Exuberance (book) }}</ref> In the preface to this edition, Shiller warns, \"The stock market has not come down to historical levels: the price-earnings ratio as I define it in this book is still, at this writing [2005], in the mid-20s, far higher than the historical average...

In parallel with various economic factors, a reason for stock market crashes is also due to panic and investing public's loss of confidence. Often, stock market crashes end speculative [[economic bubble]]s.\n\nThere have been famous [[stock market crash]]es that have ended in the loss of billions of dollars and wealth destruction on a massive scale. An increasing number of people are involved in the stock market, especially since the [[social security]] and [[retirement plan]]s are being increasingly privatized and linked to [[stock]]s and bonds and other elements of the market. There have been a number of famous stock market crashes like the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], the [[stock market crash of 1973\u20134]], the [[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday of 1987]], the [[Dot-com bubble]] of 2000, and the Stock Market Crash of 2008.\n\n=== 1929 ===\nOne of the most famous stock market crashes started October 24, 1929, on Black Thursday. The [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] lost 50% during this stock market crash. It was the beginning of the [[Great Depression]]. \n\n=== 1987 ===\nAnother famous crash took place on October 19, 1987 \u2013 Black Monday. The crash began in Hong Kong and quickly spread around the world.\n\nBy the end of October, stock markets in Hong Kong had fallen 45.5%, Australia 41.8%, Spain 31%, the United Kingdom 26.4%, the United States 22.68%, and Canada 22.5%. Black Monday itself was the largest one-day percentage decline in stock market history \u2013 the Dow Jones fell by 22.6% in a day. The names \"Black Monday\" and \"Black Tuesday\" are also used for October 28\u201329, 1929, which followed Terrible Thursday\u2014the starting day of the stock market crash in 1929.\n\nThe crash in 1987 raised some puzzles \u2013 main news and events did not predict the catastrophe and visible reasons for the collapse were not identified. This event raised questions about many important assumptions of modern economics, namely, the [[theory of rational conduct of human being|theory of rational human conduct]], the [[theory of market equilibrium]] and the [[efficient-market hypothesis]]. For some time after the crash, trading in stock exchanges worldwide was halted, since the exchange computers did not perform well owing to enormous quantity of trades being received at one time. This halt in trading allowed the [[Federal Reserve System]] and central banks of other countries to take measures to control the spreading of worldwide financial crisis. In the United States the SEC introduced several new measures of control into the stock market in an attempt to prevent a re-occurrence of the events of Black Monday.\n\n=== Circuit breakers ===\nSince the early 1990s, many of the largest exchanges have adopted electronic 'matching engines' to bring together buyers and sellers, replacing the open outcry system. Electronic trading now accounts for the majority of trading in many developed countries. Computer systems were upgraded in the stock exchanges to handle larger trading volumes in a more accurate and controlled manner. The SEC modified the margin requirements in an attempt to lower the volatility of common stocks, stock options and the futures market. The [[New York Stock Exchange]] and the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] introduced the concept of a circuit breaker. The circuit breaker halts trading if the Dow declines a prescribed number of points for a prescribed amount of time. In February 2012, the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) introduced single-stock circuit breakers.<ref>[http://fixglobal.com/home/completing-the-circuit-canadian-regulation/ Completing the Circuit: Canadian Regulation], FIXGlobal, February 2012</ref>\n* New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) circuit breakers<ref>\n{{cite web | url=https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/trading-info | title=Trading Information | publisher=[[New York Stock Exchange]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://personal.vanguard.com/us/content/Funds/FundsToolsCircuitBreakersJSP.jsp | title=Market volatility regulations | publisher=[[The Vanguard Group]]}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! % drop in [[S&P 500 Index]]\n! trading halt\n\n|-\n| 7%\n| Trading will halt for 15 minutes only if drop occurs before 3:25 p.m\n|-\n| 13%\n| Trading will halt for 15 minutes only if drop occurs before 3:25 p.m.\n|-\n| 20%\n| Trading will stop for the day\n|}\n\n==Stock market index==\n{{Main|Stock market index}}\n\nThe movements of the prices in global, regional or local markets are captured in price indices called stock market indices, of which there are many, e.g. the [[Standard & Poor's|S&P]], the [[FTSE 100 Index|FTSE]] and the [[Euronext]] indices. Such indices are usually [[market capitalization]] weighted, with the weights reflecting the contribution of the stock to the index. The constituents of the index are reviewed frequently to include/exclude stocks in order to reflect the changing business environment.\n\n==Derivative instruments==\n{{Main|Derivative (finance)}}\n\nFinancial innovation has brought many new financial instruments whose pay-offs or values depend on the prices of stocks. Some examples are [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs), [[stock index]] and [[stock option]]s, [[equity swap]]s, [[single-stock futures]], and stock index [[futures contract|futures]]. These last two may be traded on [[futures exchange]]s (which are distinct from stock exchanges\u2014their history traces back to [[commodity]] futures exchanges), or traded [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]]. As all of these products are only ''[[Derivative (finance)|derived]]'' from stocks, they are sometimes considered to be traded in a (hypothetical) [[derivatives market]], rather than the (hypothetical) stock market.\n\n==Leveraged strategies==\nStock that a trader does not actually own may be traded using [[short selling]]; [[margin buying]] may be used to purchase stock with borrowed funds; or, ''[[derivative (finance)|derivatives]]'' may be used to control large blocks of stocks for a much smaller amount of money than would be required by outright purchase or sales.\n\n===Short selling===\n{{Main|Short selling}}\nIn short selling, the trader borrows stock (usually from his brokerage which holds its clients' shares or its own shares on account to lend to short sellers) then sells it on the market, betting that the price will fall. The trader eventually buys back the stock, making money if the price fell in the meantime and losing money if it rose. Exiting a short position by buying back the stock is called \"covering\". This strategy may also be used by unscrupulous traders in illiquid or thinly traded markets to artificially lower the price of a stock. Hence most markets either prevent short selling or place restrictions on when and how a short sale can occur. The practice of [[naked shorting]] is illegal in most (but not all) stock markets.\n\n===Margin buying===\n{{Main|margin (finance)#Margin buying|l1=margin buying}}\nIn margin buying, the trader borrows money (at interest) to buy a stock and hopes for it to rise. Most industrialized countries have regulations that require that if the borrowing is based on collateral from other stocks the trader owns outright, it can be a maximum of a certain percentage of those other stocks' value. In the United States, the margin requirements have been 50% for many years (that is, if you want to make a $1000 investment, you need to put up $500, and there is often a maintenance margin below the $500).\n\nA margin call is made if the total value of the investor's account cannot support the loss of the trade. (Upon a decline in the value of the margined securities additional funds may be required to maintain the account's equity, and with or without notice the margined security or any others within the account may be sold by the brokerage to protect its loan position. The investor is responsible for any shortfall following such forced sales.)\n\nRegulation of margin requirements (by the [[Federal Reserve]]) was implemented after the [[Crash of 1929]]. Before that, speculators typically only needed to put up as little as 10 percent (or even less) of the total [[investment]] represented by the stocks purchased. Other rules may include the prohibition of ''free-riding:'' putting in an order to buy stocks without paying initially (there is normally a three-day grace period for delivery of the stock), but then selling them (before the three-days are up) and using part of the proceeds to make the original payment (assuming that the value of the stocks has not declined in the interim).\n\n==New issuance==\nFor statistics on equity issuances, see [[Refinitiv league tables]].\n\n==Investment strategies==\n{{Main|Investment strategy|Stock market prediction|Investment management}}\nMany strategies can be classified as either [[fundamental analysis]] or [[technical analysis]]. [[Fundamental analysis]] refers to analyzing companies by their [[financial statement]]s found in [[SEC filing]]s, business trends, and general economic conditions. [[Technical analysis]] studies price actions in markets through the use of charts and quantitative techniques to attempt to forecast price trends based on historical performance, regardless of the company's financial prospects. One example of a technical strategy is the [[Trend following]] method, used by [[John W. Henry]] and [[Ed Seykota]], which uses price patterns and is also rooted in [[risk management]] and [[diversification (finance)|diversification]].\n\nAdditionally, many choose to invest via passive [[index fund]]s. In this method, one holds a portfolio of the entire stock market or some segment of the stock market (such as the [[S&P 500 Index]] or [[Wilshire 5000]]). The principal aim of this strategy is to maximize diversification, minimize taxes from realizing gains, and ride the general trend of the stock market to rise.\n\nResponsible investment emphasizes and requires a long-term horizon on the basis of [[fundamental analysis]] only, avoiding hazards in the expected return of the investment. [[Socially responsible investing]] is another investment preference.\n\n==Taxation==\nTaxation is a consideration of all investment strategies; profit from owning stocks, including dividends received, is subject to different tax rates depending on the type of security and the holding period. Most profit from stock investing is taxed via a [[capital gains tax]]. In many countries, the corporations pay taxes to the government and the shareholders once again pay taxes when they profit from owning the stock, known as \"double taxation\".\n\ncarl is cool\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book | last = Hamilton | first = W.

Investment in the stock market is most often done via [[stockbroker]]ages and [[electronic trading platform]]s. Investment is usually made with an [[investment strategy]] in mind.\n\nStocks can be categorized by the country where the company is domiciled. For example, [[Nestl\u00e9]] and [[Novartis]] are domiciled in Switzerland and traded on the [[SIX Swiss Exchange]], so they may be considered as part of the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] stock market, although the stocks may also be traded on exchanges in other countries, for example, as [[American depository receipt]]s (ADRs) on U.S. stock markets.\n\n==Size of the markets==\nThe total [[market capitalization]] of equity backed securities worldwide rose from $2.5 trillion in 1980 to $68.65 trillion at the end of 2018.<ref>{{Cite web | title=Market capitalization of listed domestic companies (current US$) | url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD | publisher=[[The World Bank]]}}</ref> As of December 31, 2019, the total [[market capitalization]] of all stocks worldwide was approximately US$70.75 trillion.<ref>{{cite web | title=Market capitalization of listed domestic companies (current US$) | url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/cm.mkt.lcap.cd | publisher=[[The World Bank]]}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2016|}}, there are 60 stock exchanges in the world.

Until the early 1600s, a bourse was not exactly a stock exchange in its modern sense. With the founding of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) in 1602 and the rise of Dutch [[capital market]]s in the early 17th century, the 'old' bourse (a place to trade [[Commodity market|commodities]], [[government bond|government]] and [[municipal bond]]s) found a new purpose \u2013 a formal exchange that specialize in creating and sustaining [[secondary market]]s in the [[Security (finance)|securities]] (such as [[corporate bond|bond]]s and [[share (finance)|share]]s of [[stock]]) issued by [[corporation]]s \u2013 or a stock exchange as we know it today.<ref>Neal, Larry (2005). \"Venture Shares of the Dutch East India Company\", in Goetzmann & Rouwenhorst (eds.), Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 165\u2013175</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101773977 |title=Is Asia the next financial center of the world? |publisher=[[CNBC.com]] |last=Murphy |first=Richard McGill |date=1 Jul 2014 |accessdate=11 Mar 2017}}</ref>|group=\"note\"}} where [[stockbroker]]s and [[stock trader|traders]] can buy and sell [[share (finance)|share]]s of [[stock]], [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], and other [[security (finance)|securities]]. Many large companies have their stocks listed on a stock exchange. This makes the stock more liquid and thus more attractive to many investors. The exchange may also act as a guarantor of settlement. Other stocks may be traded \"over the counter\" (OTC), that is, through a dealer. Some large companies will have their stock listed on more than one exchange in different countries, so as to attract international investors.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ibm.com/investor/faq/item/stock-exchanges.wss | title=IBM Investor relations - FAQ &#124; On what stock exchanges is IBM listed ? |publisher=[[IBM]]}}</ref>\n\nStock exchanges may also cover other types of securities, such as fixed interest securities (bonds) or (less frequently) derivatives which are more likely to be traded OTC.\n\nTrade in stock markets means the transfer (in exchange for money) of a stock or security from a seller to a buyer. This requires these two parties to agree on a price. [[Equity (finance)|Equities]] (stocks or shares) confer an ownership interest in a particular company.\n\nParticipants in the stock market range from small individual [[stock investors]] to larger investors, who can be based anywhere in the world, and may include [[bank]]s, [[insurance]] companies, [[pension fund]]s and [[hedge fund]]s. Their buy or sell orders may be executed on their behalf by a stock exchange [[trader (finance)|trader]].\n\nSome exchanges are physical locations where transactions are carried out on a trading floor, by a method known as [[open outcry]]. This method is used in some stock exchanges and [[commodities exchange]]s, and involves traders shouting bid and offer prices. The other type of stock exchange has a network of computers where trades are made electronically. An example of such an exchange is the [[NASDAQ]].\n\nA potential buyer ''bids'' a specific price for a stock, and a potential seller ''asks'' a specific price for the same stock. Buying or selling ''at the market'' means you will accept ''any'' ask price or bid price for the stock. When the bid and ask prices match, a sale takes place, on a first-come, first-served basis if there are multiple bidders at a given price.\n\nThe purpose of a stock exchange is to facilitate the exchange of securities between buyers and sellers, thus providing a [[marketplace]]. The exchanges provide real-time trading information on the listed securities, facilitating [[price discovery]].\n\nThe [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE) is a physical exchange, with a [[hybrid market]] for placing orders electronically from any location as well as on the [[trading floor]]. Orders executed on the trading floor enter by way of exchange members and flow down to a [[floor broker]], who submits the order electronically to the floor trading post for the Designated [[market maker]] (\"DMM\") for that stock to trade the order. The DMM's job is to maintain a two-sided market, making orders to buy and sell the security when there are no other buyers or sellers. If a [[bid\u2013ask spread]] exists, no trade immediately takes place \u2013 in this case the DMM may use their own resources (money or stock) to close the difference. Once a trade has been made, the details are reported on the \"tape\" and sent back to the brokerage firm, which then notifies the investor who placed the order. Computers play an important role, especially for [[program trading]].\n\nThe [[NASDAQ]] is an electronic exchange, where all of the trading is done over a computer network. The process is similar to the New York Stock Exchange. One or more NASDAQ [[market maker]]s will always provide a bid and ask price at which they will always purchase or sell 'their' stock.\n\nThe [[Paris Bourse]], now part of [[Euronext]], is an order-driven, electronic stock exchange. It was automated in the late 1980s. Prior to the 1980s, it consisted of an open outcry exchange. [[Stockbroker]]s met on the trading floor of the Palais Brongniart. In 1986, the [[CATS (trading system)|CATS trading system]] was introduced, and the [[order matching system]] was fully automated.\n\nPeople trading stock will prefer to trade on the most popular exchange since this gives the largest number of potential counter parties (buyers for a seller, sellers for a buyer) and probably the best price. However, there have always been alternatives such as brokers trying to bring parties together to trade outside the exchange. Some third markets that were popular are [[Instinet]], and later Island and Archipelago (the latter two have since been acquired by Nasdaq and NYSE, respectively). One advantage is that this avoids the [[Commission (remuneration)|commissions]] of the exchange. However, it also has problems such as [[adverse selection]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/ubs-goldman-wean-away-trade-from-nyse-nasdaq/articleshow/726712.cms | title=UBS, Goldman wean away trade from NYSE, Nasdaq | work=[[The Economic Times]] | date=December 6, 2006}}</ref> Financial regulators have probed [[dark pool]]s.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-12/off-exchange-stock-trading-reaches-two-year-high-in-u-s- | title=Dark Pools Take Larger Share of Trades Amid SEC Scrutiny|publisher=[[Bloomberg News]] | first=Sam | last=Mamudi | date=June 13, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.ft.com/content/50428000-220d-11e4-9d4a-00144feabdc0 | title=Financial regulators probe dark pools | work=[[Financial Times]] | date=September 15, 2014 | url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n\n==Market participant==\n[[Market participant]]s include individual retail investors, [[institutional investor]]s (e.g., [[pension fund]]s, [[insurance companies]], [[mutual fund]]s, [[index fund]]s, [[exchange-traded fund]]s, [[hedge fund]]s, investor groups, banks and various other [[financial institution]]s), and also publicly traded corporations trading in their own shares.

Conversely, the money used to directly purchase stock is subject to taxation as are any dividends or capital gains they generate for the holder. In this way the current tax code incentivizes individuals to invest indirectly.<ref>{{Cite journal | title=Government Policy and Ownership of Financial Assets | date=2013-01-01 | first = Kristian | last=Rydqvist | first2=Joshua | last2=Spizman | first3=Ilya A. | last3=Strebulaev | ssrn=1428442}}</ref>\n\n==== Participation by income and wealth strata ====\nRates of participation and the value of holdings differs significantly across strata of income.

Indirect participation in the form of 401k ownership shows a similar pattern with a national participation rate of 42.1%, a rate of 46.4% for white households, 31.7% for black households, and 25.8% for Hispanic households. Households headed by married couples participated at rates above the national averages with 25.6% participating directly and 53.4% participating indirectly through a retirement account. 14.7% of households headed by men participated in the market directly and 33.4% owned stock through a retirement account. 12.6% of female headed households directly owned stock and 28.7% owned stock indirectly.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====Determinants and possible explanations of stock market participation====\nIn a 2003 paper by Vissing-J\u00f8rgensen attempts to explain disproportionate rates of participation along wealth and income groups as a function of fixed costs associated with investing.

From predominantly Dutch-speaking cities of the [[Low Countries]] (like [[Bruges]] and [[Antwerp]]), the term 'beurs' spread to other European states where it was corrupted into 'bourse', 'borsa', 'bolsa', 'b\u00f6rse', etc.]]\n\n===Early history===\nIn 12th-century France, the ''courretiers de change'' were concerned with managing and regulating the debts of agricultural communities on behalf of the banks. Because these men also traded with debts, they could be called the first [[broker]]s. A common misbelief {{Citation needed|reason=|date=March 2017}} is that, in late 13th-century [[Bruges]], commodity traders gathered inside the house of a man called ''Van der Beurze'', and in 1409 they became the \"Brugse Beurse\", institutionalizing what had been, until then, an informal meeting, but actually, the family Van der Beurze had a building in [[Antwerp]] where those gatherings occurred;<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.belgiumview.com/belgiumview/tl1/view0002205.php4 | title=16de eeuwse traditionele bak- en zandsteenarchitectuur Oude Beurs Antwerpen 1 (centrum) / Antwerp foto | publisher=Belgiumview.com}}</ref>  the Van der Beurze had Antwerp, as most of the merchants of that period, as their primary place for trading. The idea quickly spread around [[Flanders]] and neighboring countries and \"Beurzen\" soon opened in [[Ghent]] and [[Rotterdam]].\n\nIn the middle of the 13th century, [[Venice|Venetian]] bankers began to trade in government securities. In 1351 the Venetian government outlawed spreading rumors intended to lower the price of government funds. Bankers in [[Pisa]], [[Verona]], [[Genoa]] and [[Florence]] also began trading in government securities during the 14th century. This was only possible because these were independent city-states not ruled by a duke but a council of influential citizens. Italian companies were also the first to issue shares. Companies in England and the Low Countries followed in the 16th century.  Around this time, a [[joint stock company]]--one whose stock is owned jointly by the shareholders--emerged and became important for colonization of what Europeans called the \"New World\".<ref>[Ralph Dahrendorft, Class and Class Conflict in Industrial Society (Stanford, CA:  Stanford University Press, 1959)]</ref>\n\n===Birth of formal stock markets===\n{{See also|Economic history of the Dutch Republic|Financial history of the Dutch Republic|Dutch East India Company}}\n[[File:Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie spiegelretourschip Amsterdam replica.jpg|180px|right|thumb|Replica of an [[East Indiaman]] of the [[Dutch East India Company]]/[[United East Indies Company]] (VOC).

The [[liquidity]] that an exchange affords the investors enables their holders to quickly and easily sell securities. This is an attractive feature of investing in stocks, compared to other less liquid investments such as [[property]] and other immoveable assets.\n\nHistory has shown that the price of [[stock]]s and other assets is an important part of the dynamics of economic activity, and can influence or be an indicator of social mood.

It seems also to be true more generally that many price movements (beyond those which are predicted to occur 'randomly') are ''not'' occasioned by new information; a study of the fifty largest one-day share price movements in the United States in the post-war period seems to confirm this.<ref name=\"Cutler, D.

Moreover, while EMH predicts that all price movement (in the absence of change in fundamental information) is random (i.e. non-trending){{dubious|date=November 2019}}, many studies have shown a marked tendency for the stock market to trend over time periods of weeks or longer. Various explanations for such large and apparently non-random price movements have been promulgated. For instance, some research has shown that changes in estimated risk, and the use of certain strategies, such as stop-loss limits and [[value at risk]] limits, ''theoretically could'' cause financial markets to overreact. But the best explanation seems to be that the distribution of stock market prices is non-Gaussian<ref>{{cite web|title=OpenStax CNX|url=http://cnx.org/contents/9UMcK-Dv@2/Non-Gaussian-Observations|website=cnx.org|publisher=Rice University|accessdate=22 February 2017}}</ref> (in which case EMH, in any of its current forms, would not be strictly applicable).<ref>{{cite book | year = 2006 |author1=Mandelbrot, Benoit  |author2=Hudson, Richard L.   |lastauthoramp=yes | title = The Misbehavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Financial Turbulence |edition=annot.| publisher = Basic Books | isbn = 978-0-465-04357-6 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | year = 2008 | author = Taleb, Nassim Nicholas | title = Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets | edition = 2nd | publisher = Random House | isbn = 978-1-4000-6793-0 | url = https://archive.org/details/fooledbyrandomne00tale }}</ref>\n\nOther research has shown that psychological factors may result in ''exaggerated'' (statistically anomalous) stock price movements (contrary to EMH which assumes such behaviors 'cancel out'). Psychological research has demonstrated that people are predisposed to 'seeing' patterns, and often will perceive a pattern in what is, in fact, just ''noise'', e.g. seeing familiar shapes in clouds or ink blots. In the present context this means that a succession of good news items about a company may lead investors to overreact positively, driving the price up. A period of good returns also boosts the investors' self-confidence, reducing their (psychological) risk threshold.<ref>{{cite journal | year = 1974|author1=Tversky, A.  |author2=Kahneman, D.  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal = Science | volume = 185 | pages = 1124\u20131131| title = Judgement under uncertainty: heuristics and biases | doi = 10.1126/science.185.4157.1124 | pmid = 17835457 | issue = 4157}}</ref>\n\nAnother phenomenon\u2014also from psychology\u2014that works against an [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] assessment is ''[[Groupthink|group thinking]]''.

In times of market stress, however, the game becomes more like poker (herding behavior takes over). The players now must give heavy weight to the psychology of other investors and how they are likely to react psychologically.\n\nIn the period running up to the 1987 crash, less than 1 percent{{fact|date=November 2019}} of the analysts' recommendations had been to sell (and even during the 2000\u20132002 [[Bear Market|bear market]], the average did not rise above 5%). In the run-up to 2000, the media amplified the general euphoria, with reports of rapidly rising share prices and the notion that large sums of money could be quickly earned in the so-called [[new economy]] stock market.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nStock markets play an essential role in growing industries that ultimately affect the economy through transferring available funds from units that have excess funds (savings) to those who are suffering from funds deficit (borrowings) (Padhi and Naik, 2012). In other words, capital markets facilitate funds movement between the above-mentioned units. This process leads to the enhancement of available financial resources which in turn affects the economic growth positively. Moreover, both economic and financial theories argue that stock prices are affected by macroeconomic trends.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nMany different academic researchers have stated that companies with low P/E ratios and smaller-sized companies have a tendency to outperform the market.

Therefore, the stock market may be swayed in either direction by press releases, rumors, [[euphoria]] and [[mass panic]].\n\nOver the short-term, stocks and other securities can be battered or buoyed by any number of fast market-changing events, making the stock market behavior difficult to predict. Emotions can drive prices up and down, people are generally not as rational as they think, and the reasons for buying and selling are generally accepted.\n\nBehaviorists argue that investors often behave ''irrationally'' when making investment decisions thereby incorrectly pricing securities, which causes market inefficiencies, which, in turn, are opportunities to make money.<ref>Sergey Perminov, ''Trendocracy and Stock Market Manipulations'' (2008, {{ISBN|978-1-4357-5244-3}}).</ref>  However, the whole notion of EMH is that these non-rational reactions to information cancel out, leaving the prices of stocks rationally determined.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average biggest gain in one day was 936.42 points or 11%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/27166818 |title=News Headlines |publisher=Cnbc.com |date=October 13, 2008 |accessdate=March 5, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Crashes===\n{{Main|Stock market crash}}\n{{further|List of stock market crashes and bear markets}}\n[[Image:IE Real SandP Prices, Earnings, and Dividends 1871-2006.png|380px|right|thumb|[[Robert Shiller]]'s plot of the S&P Composite Real Price Index, Earnings, Dividends, and Interest Rates, from ''[[Irrational Exuberance (book)|Irrational Exuberance]]'', 2d ed.<ref name=\"IE2\">{{cite book |last=Shiller |first=Robert |title=Irrational Exuberance |edition=2nd|year=2005 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-691-12335-6 |title-link=Irrational Exuberance (book) }}</ref> In the preface to this edition, Shiller warns, \"The stock market has not come down to historical levels: the price-earnings ratio as I define it in this book is still, at this writing [2005], in the mid-20s, far higher than the historical average...

In parallel with various economic factors, a reason for stock market crashes is also due to panic and investing public's loss of confidence. Often, stock market crashes end speculative [[economic bubble]]s.\n\nThere have been famous [[stock market crash]]es that have ended in the loss of billions of dollars and wealth destruction on a massive scale. An increasing number of people are involved in the stock market, especially since the [[social security]] and [[retirement plan]]s are being increasingly privatized and linked to [[stock]]s and bonds and other elements of the market. There have been a number of famous stock market crashes like the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], the [[stock market crash of 1973\u20134]], the [[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday of 1987]], the [[Dot-com bubble]] of 2000, and the Stock Market Crash of 2008.\n\n=== 1929 ===\nOne of the most famous stock market crashes started October 24, 1929, on Black Thursday. The [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] lost 50% during this stock market crash. It was the beginning of the [[Great Depression]]. \n\n=== 1987 ===\nAnother famous crash took place on October 19, 1987 \u2013 Black Monday. The crash began in Hong Kong and quickly spread around the world.\n\nBy the end of October, stock markets in Hong Kong had fallen 45.5%, Australia 41.8%, Spain 31%, the United Kingdom 26.4%, the United States 22.68%, and Canada 22.5%. Black Monday itself was the largest one-day percentage decline in stock market history \u2013 the Dow Jones fell by 22.6% in a day. The names \"Black Monday\" and \"Black Tuesday\" are also used for October 28\u201329, 1929, which followed Terrible Thursday\u2014the starting day of the stock market crash in 1929.\n\nThe crash in 1987 raised some puzzles \u2013 main news and events did not predict the catastrophe and visible reasons for the collapse were not identified. This event raised questions about many important assumptions of modern economics, namely, the [[theory of rational conduct of human being|theory of rational human conduct]], the [[theory of market equilibrium]] and the [[efficient-market hypothesis]]. For some time after the crash, trading in stock exchanges worldwide was halted, since the exchange computers did not perform well owing to enormous quantity of trades being received at one time. This halt in trading allowed the [[Federal Reserve System]] and central banks of other countries to take measures to control the spreading of worldwide financial crisis. In the United States the SEC introduced several new measures of control into the stock market in an attempt to prevent a re-occurrence of the events of Black Monday.\n\n=== Circuit breakers ===\nSince the early 1990s, many of the largest exchanges have adopted electronic 'matching engines' to bring together buyers and sellers, replacing the open outcry system. Electronic trading now accounts for the majority of trading in many developed countries. Computer systems were upgraded in the stock exchanges to handle larger trading volumes in a more accurate and controlled manner. The SEC modified the margin requirements in an attempt to lower the volatility of common stocks, stock options and the futures market. The [[New York Stock Exchange]] and the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] introduced the concept of a circuit breaker. The circuit breaker halts trading if the Dow declines a prescribed number of points for a prescribed amount of time. In February 2012, the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) introduced single-stock circuit breakers.<ref>[http://fixglobal.com/home/completing-the-circuit-canadian-regulation/ Completing the Circuit: Canadian Regulation], FIXGlobal, February 2012</ref>\n* New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) circuit breakers<ref>\n{{cite web | url=https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/trading-info | title=Trading Information | publisher=[[New York Stock Exchange]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://personal.vanguard.com/us/content/Funds/FundsToolsCircuitBreakersJSP.jsp | title=Market volatility regulations | publisher=[[The Vanguard Group]]}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! % drop in [[S&P 500 Index]]\n! trading halt\n\n|-\n| 7%\n| Trading will halt for 15 minutes only if drop occurs before 3:25 p.m\n|-\n| 13%\n| Trading will halt for 15 minutes only if drop occurs before 3:25 p.m.\n|-\n| 20%\n| Trading will stop for the day\n|}\n\n==Stock market index==\n{{Main|Stock market index}}\n\nThe movements of the prices in global, regional or local markets are captured in price indices called stock market indices, of which there are many, e.g. the [[Standard & Poor's|S&P]], the [[FTSE 100 Index|FTSE]] and the [[Euronext]] indices. Such indices are usually [[market capitalization]] weighted, with the weights reflecting the contribution of the stock to the index. The constituents of the index are reviewed frequently to include/exclude stocks in order to reflect the changing business environment.\n\n==Derivative instruments==\n{{Main|Derivative (finance)}}\n\nFinancial innovation has brought many new financial instruments whose pay-offs or values depend on the prices of stocks. Some examples are [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs), [[stock index]] and [[stock option]]s, [[equity swap]]s, [[single-stock futures]], and stock index [[futures contract|futures]]. These last two may be traded on [[futures exchange]]s (which are distinct from stock exchanges\u2014their history traces back to [[commodity]] futures exchanges), or traded [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]]. As all of these products are only ''[[Derivative (finance)|derived]]'' from stocks, they are sometimes considered to be traded in a (hypothetical) [[derivatives market]], rather than the (hypothetical) stock market.\n\n==Leveraged strategies==\nStock that a trader does not actually own may be traded using [[short selling]]; [[margin buying]] may be used to purchase stock with borrowed funds; or, ''[[derivative (finance)|derivatives]]'' may be used to control large blocks of stocks for a much smaller amount of money than would be required by outright purchase or sales.\n\n===Short selling===\n{{Main|Short selling}}\nIn short selling, the trader borrows stock (usually from his brokerage which holds its clients' shares or its own shares on account to lend to short sellers) then sells it on the market, betting that the price will fall. The trader eventually buys back the stock, making money if the price fell in the meantime and losing money if it rose. Exiting a short position by buying back the stock is called \"covering\". This strategy may also be used by unscrupulous traders in illiquid or thinly traded markets to artificially lower the price of a stock. Hence most markets either prevent short selling or place restrictions on when and how a short sale can occur. The practice of [[naked shorting]] is illegal in most (but not all) stock markets.\n\n===Margin buying===\n{{Main|margin (finance)#Margin buying|l1=margin buying}}\nIn margin buying, the trader borrows money (at interest) to buy a stock and hopes for it to rise. Most industrialized countries have regulations that require that if the borrowing is based on collateral from other stocks the trader owns outright, it can be a maximum of a certain percentage of those other stocks' value. In the United States, the margin requirements have been 50% for many years (that is, if you want to make a $1000 investment, you need to put up $500, and there is often a maintenance margin below the $500).\n\nA margin call is made if the total value of the investor's account cannot support the loss of the trade. (Upon a decline in the value of the margined securities additional funds may be required to maintain the account's equity, and with or without notice the margined security or any others within the account may be sold by the brokerage to protect its loan position. The investor is responsible for any shortfall following such forced sales.)\n\nRegulation of margin requirements (by the [[Federal Reserve]]) was implemented after the [[Crash of 1929]]. Before that, speculators typically only needed to put up as little as 10 percent (or even less) of the total [[investment]] represented by the stocks purchased. Other rules may include the prohibition of ''free-riding:'' putting in an order to buy stocks without paying initially (there is normally a three-day grace period for delivery of the stock), but then selling them (before the three-days are up) and using part of the proceeds to make the original payment (assuming that the value of the stocks has not declined in the interim).\n\n==New issuance==\nFor statistics on equity issuances, see [[Refinitiv league tables]].\n\n==Investment strategies==\n{{Main|Investment strategy|Stock market prediction|Investment management}}\nMany strategies can be classified as either [[fundamental analysis]] or [[technical analysis]]. [[Fundamental analysis]] refers to analyzing companies by their [[financial statement]]s found in [[SEC filing]]s, business trends, and general economic conditions. [[Technical analysis]] studies price actions in markets through the use of charts and quantitative techniques to attempt to forecast price trends based on historical performance, regardless of the company's financial prospects. One example of a technical strategy is the [[Trend following]] method, used by [[John W. Henry]] and [[Ed Seykota]], which uses price patterns and is also rooted in [[risk management]] and [[diversification (finance)|diversification]].\n\nAdditionally, many choose to invest via passive [[index fund]]s. In this method, one holds a portfolio of the entire stock market or some segment of the stock market (such as the [[S&P 500 Index]] or [[Wilshire 5000]]). The principal aim of this strategy is to maximize diversification, minimize taxes from realizing gains, and ride the general trend of the stock market to rise.\n\nResponsible investment emphasizes and requires a long-term horizon on the basis of [[fundamental analysis]] only, avoiding hazards in the expected return of the investment. [[Socially responsible investing]] is another investment preference.\n\n==Taxation==\nTaxation is a consideration of all investment strategies; profit from owning stocks, including dividends received, is subject to different tax rates depending on the type of security and the holding period. Most profit from stock investing is taxed via a [[capital gains tax]]. In many countries, the corporations pay taxes to the government and the shareholders once again pay taxes when they profit from owning the stock, known as \"double taxation\".\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Equity crowdfunding]]\n* [[List of stock exchange trading hours]]\n* [[List of stock exchanges]]\n* [[List of stock market indices]]\n* [[Modeling and analysis of financial markets]]\n* [[Securities market participants (United States)]]\n* [[Securities regulation in the United States]]\n* [[Selling climax]]\n* [[Stock market bubble]]\n* [[Stock market cycles]]\n* [[Stock market data systems]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book | last = Hamilton | first = W.

''Bax: A Composer and His Times'' (1983)</ref> A correspondence began in 1947, which led to a lifelong friendship. Around 40 of the letters have been published.

He was awarded the [[Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge]] medal for conducting in 1955.<ref name=jan/>\n\nHowever, from 1951 Whelen became musical director at the [[Old Vic Theatre]] in London and most of his conducting commitments were dropped. While there (and from 1955 at other theatres as well) he produced much incidental music for [[Shakespeare]] and other productions.<ref>''Shakespeare Quarterly'', Vol 7 No 1 (Winter 1956), p 85-6</ref> He composed the music  for [[John Osborne]]'s ''[[The World of Paul Slickey]]'' (1959). This was Osborne's only attempt to write a musical. But after the huge successes of his previous plays ''[[Look Back in Anger]]'' and ''[[The Entertainer (play)|The Entertainer]],'' the play was to become \"one of the most spectacular disasters in English theatre\".<ref>Heilpern, John, ''John Osborne: A Patriot for Us'', 2007, Random House, pp.249-54</ref> Despite this setback, the theatre work led to a series of commissions by the [[BBC]] spanning the 1960s to the 1980s for radio productions with original music, including television and radio operas as well as hard to classify music dramas for which Whelen typically wrote both the words and music, fusing the music and action together.\n\nWhelen met his lifelong partner Dennis Andrews in 1948 in Bournemouth They lived together for many years in [[Cumnor]], Oxfordshire before Whelen's death in 1993.<ref name=jan/> The Christopher Whelen Award for innovation in music in film and theatre was set up in his name. Winners include Paddy Cunneen, [[Jonathan Dove]], [[Andy Price]] and Mick Sands.\n\n==Music==\nWhelen was primarily a music dramatist and his most successful works are the series of radio and television music theatre works commissioned by the BBC starting from the 1960s. His first operatic production, broadcast on 6 August 1961, was ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'', for which he contributed new arrangements of the traditional ballads.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/99c092c336a44340a92d70876927b3e5 ''Radio Times'' Issue 1969, 3 August 1961, p 16]</ref> The original radio opera ''The Cancelling Dark'', with text by the poet [[Vernon Scannell]], followed on 5 December 1965.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/56c3c8cc4c014d2a934bbe460e3ca918 ''Radio Times'' Issue 2195, 2 December 1965, p 22]</ref> The action alternates between a crashed aircraft in the African jungle near [[Benguela]] and the radio control room at [[Kakonda]] Airfield.

'Thoughts on Television Opera' in ''Composer'' 24 (1967), p 17</ref>\n\nBy 1969 for ''Incident at Owl Creek'' Whelen had dispensed with a librettist, adapting the source material (based on the short story by [[Ambrose Bierce]]) himself.

In 1951 Whelen conducted Bax's Sixth Symphony in Bournemouth. Bax wrote: \"I still dote on your performance of No 6 and want a repeat\".<ref name=tempo>Scott-Sutherland, Colin. 'Review, Cuchulan Among the Guns' in ''Tempo'' No 2015, January 2001, p 34-5</ref> Through Bax Whelen also met the pianist [[Harriet Cohen]], who became a supporter. He was awarded the [[Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge]] medal for conducting in 1955.<ref name=jan/>\n\nHowever, from 1951 Whelen became musical director at the [[Old Vic Theatre]] in London and most of his conducting commitments were dropped. While there (and from 1955 at other theatres as well) he produced much incidental music for [[Shakespeare]] and other productions.<ref>''Shakespeare Quarterly'', Vol 7 No 1 (Winter 1956), p 85-6</ref> He composed the music  for [[John Osborne]]'s ''[[The World of Paul Slickey]]'' (1959). This was Osborne's only attempt to write a musical. But after the huge successes of his previous plays ''[[Look Back in Anger]]'' and ''[[The Entertainer (play)|The Entertainer]],'' the play was to become \"one of the most spectacular disasters in English theatre\".<ref>Heilpern, John, ''John Osborne: A Patriot for Us'', 2007, Random House, pp.249-54</ref> Despite this setback, the theatre work led to a series of commissions by the [[BBC]] spanning the 1960s to the 1980s for radio productions with original music, including television and radio operas as well as hard to classify music dramas for which Whelen typically wrote both the words and music, fusing the music and action together.\n\nWhelen met his lifelong partner Dennis Andrews in 1948 in Bournemouth They lived together for many years in [[Cumnor]], Oxfordshire before Whelen's death in 1993.<ref name=jan/> The Christopher Whelen Award for innovation in music in film and theatre was set up in his name. Winners include Paddy Cunneen, [[Jonathan Dove]], [[Andy Price]] and Mick Sands.\n\n==Music==\nWhelen was primarily a music dramatist and his most successful works are the series of radio and television music theatre works commissioned by the BBC starting from the 1960s. His first operatic production, broadcast on 6 August 1961, was ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'', for which he contributed new arrangements of the traditional ballads.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/99c092c336a44340a92d70876927b3e5 ''Radio Times'' Issue 1969, 3 August 1961, p 16]</ref> The original radio opera ''The Cancelling Dark'', with text by the poet [[Vernon Scannell]], followed on 5 December 1965.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/56c3c8cc4c014d2a934bbe460e3ca918 ''Radio Times'' Issue 2195, 2 December 1965, p 22]</ref> The action alternates between a crashed aircraft in the African jungle near [[Benguela]] and the radio control room at [[Kakonda]] Airfield. Jeremy Rundall in ''The Sunday Times'' said it \"has an Ancient Mariner-ish ring, and should be heard again\".<ref>''Sunday Times'', 12 December 1965, p 40</ref>\n\nThe specifically commissioned television opera ''Some Place of Darkness'' used an original libretto by the experienced television writer [[John Hopkins (writer)|John Hopkins]]. The BBC insisted on realism, and the result was \" a sombre domestic drama set in the present, it exemplified all that television promoted\".<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6fwSLslWOjsC&pg=PA9&lpg=PA9&dq=%22Some+place+of+darkness%22+%22television+opera%22&source=bl&ots=b_k28mFrbb&sig=ACfU3U2uiIHxXAQHFjddkSSblEjGXMLm6g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwji-7CJovfoAhUNQRUIHeqrACcQ6AEwAXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Some%20place%20of%20darkness%22%20%22television%20opera%22&f=false Barnes, Jennifer.

The piece, he said \"was the result of a BBC edict - crisp and clear - 'contemporary plot and modern dress'. The words smacked like a damp cloth on the operatic table.\"<ref>Whelen, Christopher. 'Thoughts on Television Opera' in ''Composer'' 24 (1967), p 17</ref>\n\nBy 1969 for ''Incident at Owl Creek'' Whelen had dispensed with a librettist, adapting the source material (based on the short story by [[Ambrose Bierce]]) himself. This led to him writing a text based on an original idea for ''The Findings'' (1972), concerning the excavation of an [[Etruscan architecture|Etruscan]] tomb.<ref>[[Rodney Milnes|Milnes, Rodney]]: \u2018The Findings\u2019 in ''Opera'' 23 (1972), p 945\u20138</ref> Creating his own plot and characters presented through his own words and music, Whelen was attempting to create a more personal form of \"total musical theatre\".<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/e648c51cd2774f2083924651d29f021c ''Radio Times'', Issue 2540, 13 July 1972 p 20]</ref> Christopher Palmer identified ''The Findings'' and ''Incident at Owl Creek'' as \"outstanding\".<ref name=grove/> The music drama ''The Restorer'', produced and directed by [[Martin Esslin]], is an example of Whelen's experimentation with the close combination of words and music. It concerns a picture in a Dutch museum and its influence on visitors, with echoes of [[The Picture of Dorian Gray|Oscar Wilde]] and [[Walter de la Mare]].\n\nAnother strand of Whelen's work was in film. He composed the score for [[The Valiant (1962 film)|''The Valiant'']] (1962), [[The Face of Fu Manchu]] (1965) and ''[[Coast of Skeletons]]'' (1965).<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0924083/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm IMDb biography]</ref> There was also a ballet, ''Cul de Sac'', choreographed by [[Norman Morrice]] and staged by [[Ballet Rambert]] on 13 July 1964 at [[Sadler's Wells]].<ref>[https://www.rambert.org.uk/performance-database/works/cul-de-sac/ Ballet Rambert performance archive]</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1964/07/20/archives/problem-ballet-shown-in-london-rambert-troupe-performs-morrices-cul.html '\u2018Problem\u2019 Ballet Shown in London; Rambert Troupe Performs Morrice's \u2018Cul de Sac\u2019' in ''The New York Times'', 20 July 1964]</ref>\n\n==Works==\n\n===Television and radio operas===\n* ''The Cancelling Dark'', radio opera, libretto by Vernon Scannell (1964)\n* ''Some Place of Darkness'', television opera, libretto by John Hopkins (1967)\n* ''Incident at Owl Creek'', radio opera, libretto Whelen after [[Ambrose Bierce]] (1969)\n* ''The Findings'', radio opera, libretto Whelen (1972)\n\n===Radio drama, words and music by Whelen===\n* ''The Restorer'' (1976)\n*  ''Marius Goring in Bridges'', a play with music written for stereo (1976)\n* ''To the Office and Back'', notes towards a portrait of [[Wallace Stevens]] (1978)\n* ''Cumulus'', a weather fantasy (1980)\n* ''The Jigsaw Must Fit'', 'musico-dramatic' work (1983)\n* ''Ed e Subito Sera'', a portrait of [[Salvatore Quasimodo]] (1984)\n* ''Broad Daylight'', a love story in words and music (1986)\n\n===Musical comedies===\n* ''School'' (1957) (adapted from [[Thomas William Robertson|T W Robertson]])\n* ''Whither London'' (1962)\n\n===Selected incidental music for theatre, radio and television===\n* ''Murder in the Cathedral'' by [[T S Eliot]] (1953, Old Vic Company, recording available)<ref>[https://naxosaudiobooks.com/murder-in-the-cathedral-unabridged/ Naxos Audio Books.

The [[Turkic Khaganate]] dominated southern Siberia during the 1st millennium CE, while in the early 2nd millennium CE, the [[Mongol Empire]] and its [[Division of the Mongol Empire|successor states]] ruled the region. The [[Khanate of Sibir]] was one of the last independent [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] states in North Asia before its [[Conquest of the Khanate of Sibir|conquest]] by the [[Tsardom of Russia]] in the 16th century CE. Russia would then gradually incorporate the region into its territory until the [[Convention of Peking]] was signed in 1860. After the [[October Revolution]] in 1917, the region was [[Eastern Front of the Russian Civil War|contested]] between the Bolsheviks and Whites until the [[Soviet Union]] asserted full control in 1923.

But Northwest Asia sometimes refers to [[Caucasus]] or nearby provinces.\n\n=== Geomorphology ===\n{{further|Geology of Russia|Geology of Asia}}\nThe geomorphology of Asia in general is imperfectly known, although the deposits and mountain ranges are well known.<ref name=\"Bridges\" />\n\nTo compensate for new [[sea floor]] having been created in the [[Siberian basin]], the whole of the [[Eurasian Plate|Asian Plate]] has pivoted about a point in the [[New Siberian Islands]], causing compression in the [[Verkhoyansk Range|Verkhoyansk mountains]], which were formed along the eastern margin of the Angara Shield by [[tectonic uplift]] during the [[Mesozoic|Mesozoic Era]]. There is a southern boundary to this across the northern margin of the [[Alps|Alpine]] folds of Afghanistan, India, Nepal, and Bhutan, which at the east of [[Brahmaputra]] turns to run south towards the [[Bay of Bengal]] along the line of the [[Naga hills]] and the [[Arakan Yoma]], continues around [[Indonesia]], and follows the edge of the [[continental shelf]] along the eastern seaboard of [[China]]. The [[Eurasian Plate]] and the [[North American Plate]] meet across the neck of [[Alaska]], following the line of the [[Aleutian Trench]], rather than meeting at the [[Bering Straits]].<ref name=\"Bridges\" />\n\nNorthern Asia is built around the Angara Shield, which lies between the [[Yenisey River]] and the [[Lena River]]. It developed from fragments of [[Laurasia]], whose rocks were mainly [[Precambrian]] crystalline rocks, [[gneiss]]es, and [[schist]]s, and [[Gondwana]]. These rocks can be found in the Angara Shield, the [[Inner Mongolian-Korean Shield]], the [[Ordes Shield]] and the [[Southeast Asia Shield]]. The fragments have been subject to [[orogenesis]] around their margins, giving a complex of plateaux and mountain ranges. One can find [[outcrop]]s of these rocks in unfolded sections of the Shields. Their presence has been confirmed below Mesozoic and later sediments.<ref name=\"Bridges\" />\n\nThere are three main periods of mountain building in Northern Asia, although it has occurred many times. The outer fold mountains, that are on the margins of the Shields and that only affected Asia north of the line of the [[Himalayas]], are attributed to the [[Caledonian orogeny|Caledonian]] and [[Variscan orogeny|Hercynian]] orogenies of the late [[Paleozoic|Palaeozoic Era]]. The Alpine orogeny caused extensive folding and faulting of Mesozoic and early [[Tertiary]] sediments from the [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys]] [[geosyncline]]. The Tibetan and Mongolian plateaux, and the structural basins of [[Tarim Basin|Tarim]], [[Qaidam]], and [[Junggar]], are delimited by major east\u2013west lithospheric faults that were probably the results of stresses caused by the impact of the [[Indian Plate]] against Laurasia. Erosion of the mountains caused by this orogeny has created a large amount of sediment, which has been transported southwards to produce the [[alluvial plain]]s of India, China, and Cambodia, and which has also been deposited in large amounts in the Tarim and [[Dzungarian Basin|Dzungarian]] basins.<ref name=\"Bridges\" />\n\n{{physical map of Siberia|width=200}}\nNorthern Asia was [[glaciation|glaciated]] in the [[Pleistocene]], but this played a less significant part in the geology of the area compared to the part that it played in [[North America]] and [[Europe]]. The Scandinavian ice sheet extended to the east of the Urals, covering the northern two thirds of the [[Ob Basin]] and extending onto the Angara Shield between the [[Yenisei River]] and the [[Lena River]]. There are legacies of mountain glaciation to be found on the east Siberian mountains, on the mountains of the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]], on the [[Altai Mountains|Altai]], on [[Tian Shan]], and on other small areas of mountains, [[ice cap]]s remain on the islands of [[Severnaya Zemlya]] and [[Novaya Zemlya]], and several [[Central Asia]]n mountains still have individual glaciers. North Asia itself has [[permafrost]], ranging in depths from 30 to 600 metres and covering an area of 9.6 million km\u00b2.<ref name=\"Bridges\" />\n\nSeveral of the mountainous regions are volcanic, with both the [[Koryak Mountains]] and the Kamchatka Peninsula having active [[volcano]]es. The [[Anadyr Plateau]] is formed from [[igneous rock]]s. The [[Mongolian Plateau]] has an area of [[basalt]]ic [[lava]]s and [[volcanic cone]]s.<ref name=\"Bridges\" />\n\nThe Angara Shield also underlies the lowlands of the [[Ob River]], but to the south and east in the Central Asian mountains and in the East Siberian mountains there are folded and faulted mountains of Lower Palaeozoic rocks.<ref name=\"Bridges\" />\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{further|Demographics of Siberia|Indigenous peoples of Siberia|Demographics of the Russian Far East}}\nMost estimates are that there are around 33 million [[Russian nationality law|Russian citizens]] living east of the [[Ural Mountains]], a widely recognized but informal geographical divide between Europe and Asia. The native [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]], [[Baltic Finnic peoples|Finnic]] and [[Tungusic peoples]] now are a minority in North Asia due to the [[Russification]] process during the last three centuries. Russian census records indicate they make up only an estimated 10% of the region's population with the [[Buryats]] numbering at 445,175, which makes them the largest ethnic minority group in Siberia.

The [[Turkic Khaganate]] dominated southern Siberia during the 1st millennium CE, while in the early 2nd millennium CE, the [[Mongol Empire]] and its [[Division of the Mongol Empire|successor states]] ruled the region. The [[Khanate of Sibir]] was one of the last independent [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] states in North Asia before its [[Conquest of the Khanate of Sibir|conquest]] by the [[Tsardom of Russia]] in the 16th century CE. Russia would then gradually incorporate the region into its territory until the [[Convention of Peking]] was signed in 1860. After the [[October Revolution]] in 1917, the region was [[Eastern Front of the Russian Civil War|contested]] between the Bolsheviks and Whites until the [[Soviet Union]] asserted full control in 1923.

But Northwest Asia sometimes refers to [[Caucasus]] or nearby provinces.\n\n=== Geomorphology ===\n{{further|Geology of Russia|Geology of Asia}}\nThe geomorphology of Asia in general is imperfectly known, although the deposits and mountain ranges are well known.<ref name=\"Bridges\" />\n\nTo compensate for new [[sea floor]] having been created in the [[Siberian basin]], the whole of the [[Eurasian Plate|Asian Plate]] has pivoted about a point in the [[New Siberian Islands]], causing compression in the [[Verkhoyansk Range|Verkhoyansk mountains]], which were formed along the eastern margin of the Angara Shield by [[tectonic uplift]] during the [[Mesozoic|Mesozoic Era]]. There is a southern boundary to this across the northern margin of the [[Alps|Alpine]] folds of Afghanistan, India, Nepal, and Bhutan, which at the east of [[Brahmaputra]] turns to run south towards the [[Bay of Bengal]] along the line of the [[Naga hills]] and the [[Arakan Yoma]], continues around [[Indonesia]], and follows the edge of the [[continental shelf]] along the eastern seaboard of [[China]]. The [[Eurasian Plate]] and the [[North American Plate]] meet across the neck of [[Alaska]], following the line of the [[Aleutian Trench]], rather than meeting at the [[Bering Straits]].<ref name=\"Bridges\" />\n\nNorthern Asia is built around the Angara Shield, which lies between the [[Yenisey River]] and the [[Lena River]]. It developed from fragments of [[Laurasia]], whose rocks were mainly [[Precambrian]] crystalline rocks, [[gneiss]]es, and [[schist]]s, and [[Gondwana]]. These rocks can be found in the Angara Shield, the [[Inner Mongolian-Korean Shield]], the [[Ordes Shield]] and the [[Southeast Asia Shield]]. The fragments have been subject to [[orogenesis]] around their margins, giving a complex of plateaux and mountain ranges. One can find [[outcrop]]s of these rocks in unfolded sections of the Shields. Their presence has been confirmed below Mesozoic and later sediments.<ref name=\"Bridges\" />\n\nThere are three main periods of mountain building in Northern Asia, although it has occurred many times. The outer fold mountains, that are on the margins of the Shields and that only affected Asia north of the line of the [[Himalayas]], are attributed to the [[Caledonian orogeny|Caledonian]] and [[Variscan orogeny|Hercynian]] orogenies of the late [[Paleozoic|Palaeozoic Era]]. The Alpine orogeny caused extensive folding and faulting of Mesozoic and early [[Tertiary]] sediments from the [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys]] [[geosyncline]]. The Tibetan and Mongolian plateaux, and the structural basins of [[Tarim Basin|Tarim]], [[Qaidam]], and [[Junggar]], are delimited by major east\u2013west lithospheric faults that were probably the results of stresses caused by the impact of the [[Indian Plate]] against Laurasia. Erosion of the mountains caused by this orogeny has created a large amount of sediment, which has been transported southwards to produce the [[alluvial plain]]s of India, China, and Cambodia, and which has also been deposited in large amounts in the Tarim and [[Dzungarian Basin|Dzungarian]] basins.<ref name=\"Bridges\" />\n\n{{physical map of Siberia|width=200}}\nNorthern Asia was [[glaciation|glaciated]] in the [[Pleistocene]], but this played a less significant part in the geology of the area compared to the part that it played in [[North America]] and [[Europe]]. The Scandinavian ice sheet extended to the east of the Urals, covering the northern two thirds of the [[Ob Basin]] and extending onto the Angara Shield between the [[Yenisei River]] and the [[Lena River]]. There are legacies of mountain glaciation to be found on the east Siberian mountains, on the mountains of the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]], on the [[Altai Mountains|Altai]], on [[Tian Shan]], and on other small areas of mountains, [[ice cap]]s remain on the islands of [[Severnaya Zemlya]] and [[Novaya Zemlya]], and several [[Central Asia]]n mountains still have individual glaciers. North Asia itself has [[permafrost]], ranging in depths from 30 to 600 metres and covering an area of 9.6 million km\u00b2.<ref name=\"Bridges\" />\n\nSeveral of the mountainous regions are volcanic, with both the [[Koryak Mountains]] and the Kamchatka Peninsula having active [[volcano]]es. The [[Anadyr Plateau]] is formed from [[igneous rock]]s. The [[Mongolian Plateau]] has an area of [[basalt]]ic [[lava]]s and [[volcanic cone]]s.<ref name=\"Bridges\" />\n\nThe Angara Shield also underlies the lowlands of the [[Ob River]], but to the south and east in the Central Asian mountains and in the East Siberian mountains there are folded and faulted mountains of Lower Palaeozoic rocks.<ref name=\"Bridges\" />\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{further|Demographics of Siberia|Indigenous peoples of Siberia|Demographics of the Russian Far East}}\nMost estimates are that there are around 33 million [[Russian nationality law|Russian citizens]] living east of the [[Ural Mountains]], a widely recognized but informal geographical divide between Europe and Asia.

Both Haye and Chisora sat down in the Sky studios and talked about their relationship, explaining how they came to a deal.

Gashi, who suffered the third defeat of his 20-fight professional career which included 17 early knockouts in 17 victories, switched southpaw from the opening bell, landed an effective counter punch in the second but Chisora connected with a good body shot in the third and took control of the fight. Chisora continued to be the aggressor throughout but his opponent survived to the end of the contest.\n\nOn 13 June 2019, a fight between Chisora and former world title challenger [[Artur Szpilka]] was announced to take place at the [[O2 Arena (London)|O2 Arena]] in London on 20 July 2019, with the bout taking place on the undercard of [[Dillian Whyte vs. Oscar Rivas]] live on [[Sky Box Office|Sky Sports Box Office]].

On 1 October Parker pulled out of the fight due to illness.\n\n==== Chisora vs. Price ====\nOn 8 October 2019, [[David Price (boxer)|David Price]] was announced as Dereck Chisora's replacement opponent at the O2 Arena. Chisora pressured Price from the start of the contest and floored his opponent in the fourth round as the fight was called to a halt following the Price corner throwing in the towel.\n\n==== Chisora vs. Usyk ====\nOn 11 March 2020, a fight between Chisora and undefeated former undisputed cruiserweight world champion [[Oleksandr Usyk]] was announced to take place at the [[O2 Arena (London)|O2 Arena]] in London on 23 May 2020, live on [[Sky Box Office|Sky Sports Box Office]]\n\n==Personal life==\nIn November 2010, Chisora was found guilty of assaulting his then-girlfriend after finding text messages from another man on her phone. He narrowly escaped being sent to prison, and was given a 12-week sentence suspended for two years. He was ordered to pay \u00a31,500 in compensation and \u00a3500 costs and complete 150 hours community work. The court was told that the fighter also had previous convictions for public order offences, assaulting a police officer and possession of an offensive weapon.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-11727784|title=Boxer Dereck Chisora guilty of assaulting girlfriend |publisher=BBC|date=10 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2015, Chisora was stopped in his [[Bentley]] near [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] in London.

This Convention regards [[violence against women]] as a form of discrimination and calls on participating governments to put measures in place to combat violence in all forms, be it domestic or public. The UAE regularly participates in and hosts international and GCC conferences on women's issues. The UAE has signed several other international treaties on protecting the rights of women. Among these are the [[Convention on the Rights of a Child]], the [[Hours of Work (Industry) Convention]], the [[Equal Remuneration Convention]], the [[Conventions Concerning Employment of Women During the Night]] and the [[Minimum Age Convention, 1973|Minimum Age Convention]].\n\nThe 2015 [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) status report on Millennium Development Goals noted that the state legislations in the UAE do not discriminate on the basis of gender with respect to education, employment or the quality of services provided.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/2015_MDG_Report/pdf/MDG%202015%20rev%20(July%201).pdf,|title=The Millennium Development Goals 2015}}</ref>\n\nThrough several initiatives women in the UAE are playing an increasingly important role in the economy, politics and technology and are viewed by some as leaders of gender equality in the Gulf region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/uae/society/uae-leader-in-gender-equality-in-region-1.1886004,|title=UAE seen as leader in women's rights in Gulf}}</ref>\n\n===Discrimination in Personal Status Code===\n[[Wali (Islamic legal guardian)|Male guardianship]] in the UAE prevents women from making autonomous decisions about marriage. Article 39 of the Personal Status Code states that a male guardian must conclude any marriage contract a woman enters into and has the power to request an annulment of the marriage.<ref>Article 39, Federal Law No. 29 of 2005 on Personal Status.</ref> Men on the other hand can marry up to four women. Article 56 makes it obligatory for women to \"obey\" their husbands.\n\nThe law in the UAE provides that a man may unilaterally divorce his wife, whereas a woman who wishes to seek a divorce must apply for a court order which is only granted on limited grounds.<ref>Article 100, Federal Law No.29 of 2005 on Personal Status.</ref> These include failure of the husband to provide maintenance, his disappearance, or sexual desertion of his wife, or because he has been sentenced to imprisonment for a term that exceeds three years.<ref>Articles 116, 124\u201331, Federal Law No. 29 of 2005 on Personal Status.</ref>\n\nThere is an alternative for women to dissolve their marriage found under article 110 of the Personal Status Code, or [[khul']], if the husband agrees to it in return for a financial settlement, however this means a woman relinquishes her right to the [[mahr]] \u2013 or the dowry she received as part of the marriage contract.\n\nAs to custody of children, women are considered physical guardians, they have the right to custody up to the age of 13 for girls and 10 for boys. But if a woman chooses to remarry she automatically forfeits her right to custody of her children.\n\nFurthermore, under article 71, women who leave their husbands can be ordered to return to their marital home.\n\n=== Violence against women ===\n====Marriage====\nIn one case the [[Federal Supreme Court of the United Arab Emirates|Federal Court]] sanctioned a husband's beating of his wife so long as he did not leave physical marks, and in another case a man was ordered to pay a fee for taking it too far by leaving physical injuries on his beaten wife.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">[https://www.hrw.org/news/2010/10/19/uae-spousal-abuse-never-right, UAE: Spousal Abuse Never a 'Right' Further to this in 2010].</ref>\n\nFurthermore, there is growing concern at the UAE's lack of action against domestic violence.

In 2014 a [[Human Rights Watch]] report spoke to domestic workers who complained about abuse and not being paid due earnings, getting rest periods or days off and excessive workloads as well as documented cases of psychological, physical and sexual abuse.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/10/22/united-arab-emirates-trapped-exploited-abused,|title=Exploited migrant workers in the UAE}}</ref> The report documents how the visa sponsorship system, or [[Islamic adoptional jurisprudence|kafala]], and the lack of labour protections leaves migrant workers exposed to abuse.\n\nThe kafala system ties a migrant worker to their employers, who act as their sponsors and makes it difficult for them to change employers. If a domestic worker attempts to leave her sponsor before the end of her contract without her sponsor's approval she will be deemed to have \"absconded\" which usually results in fines and deportation.<ref>Article 95 and 96(a) of Executive Regulations of the Entry and Residence of Foreigners Law</ref>\n\nFederal law No.8 excludes domestic workers from labour laws and the environment which they work in is not regulated by the Ministry of Labour. This means domestic migrant workers have fewer rights than other migrant workers. In 2012 the government stated that the cabinet had approved a bill on domestic workers, however, Human Rights Watch has received no response to requests to obtain a draft.<ref>Human Rights Watch, \"'I Already Bought you': Abuse and Exploitation of Female Migrant Domestic Workers in the United Arab Emirates,\" p.29</ref>\n\nIn January 2016, Amnesty international said UAE government continues to violate rights of migrant workers in the country.

Amnesty also said that women workers from Asia and Africa are explicitly excluded from labour law protections and particularly vulnerable to serious abuses, including forced labour and human trafficking.<ref name=\"amnestyMENA\"/>\n\nIn March 2019, the [[Human Rights Watch]] reported that eight [[Lebanese people|Lebanese nationals]] have been detained by the Emirati authorities on the accusations of terrorism charges, without any evidence.

This Convention regards [[violence against women]] as a form of discrimination and calls on participating governments to put measures in place to combat violence in all forms, be it domestic or public. The UAE regularly participates in and hosts international and GCC conferences on women's issues. The UAE has signed several other international treaties on protecting the rights of women. Among these are the [[Convention on the Rights of a Child]], the [[Hours of Work (Industry) Convention]], the [[Equal Remuneration Convention]], the [[Conventions Concerning Employment of Women During the Night]] and the [[Minimum Age Convention, 1973|Minimum Age Convention]].\n\nThe 2015 [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) status report on Millennium Development Goals noted that the state legislations in the UAE do not discriminate on the basis of gender with respect to education, employment or the quality of services provided.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/2015_MDG_Report/pdf/MDG%202015%20rev%20(July%201).pdf,|title=The Millennium Development Goals 2015}}</ref>\n\nThrough several initiatives women in the UAE are playing an increasingly important role in the economy, politics and technology and are viewed by some as leaders of gender equality in the Gulf region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/uae/society/uae-leader-in-gender-equality-in-region-1.1886004,|title=UAE seen as leader in women's rights in Gulf}}</ref>\n\n===Discrimination in Personal Status Code===\n[[Wali (Islamic legal guardian)|Male guardianship]] in the UAE prevents women from making autonomous decisions about marriage. Article 39 of the Personal Status Code states that a male guardian must conclude any marriage contract a woman enters into and has the power to request an annulment of the marriage.<ref>Article 39, Federal Law No. 29 of 2005 on Personal Status.</ref> Men on the other hand can marry up to four women. Article 56 makes it obligatory for women to \"obey\" their husbands.\n\nThe law in the UAE provides that a man may unilaterally divorce his wife, whereas a woman who wishes to seek a divorce must apply for a court order which is only granted on limited grounds.<ref>Article 100, Federal Law No.29 of 2005 on Personal Status.</ref> These include failure of the husband to provide maintenance, his disappearance, or sexual desertion of his wife, or because he has been sentenced to imprisonment for a term that exceeds three years.<ref>Articles 116, 124\u201331, Federal Law No. 29 of 2005 on Personal Status.</ref>\n\nThere is an alternative for women to dissolve their marriage found under article 110 of the Personal Status Code, or [[khul']], if the husband agrees to it in return for a financial settlement, however this means a woman relinquishes her right to the [[mahr]] \u2013 or the dowry she received as part of the marriage contract.\n\nAs to custody of children, women are considered physical guardians, they have the right to custody up to the age of 13 for girls and 10 for boys. But if a woman chooses to remarry she automatically forfeits her right to custody of her children.\n\nFurthermore, under article 71, women who leave their husbands can be ordered to return to their marital home.\n\n=== Violence against women ===\n====Marriage====\nIn one case the [[Federal Supreme Court of the United Arab Emirates|Federal Court]] sanctioned a husband's beating of his wife so long as he did not leave physical marks, and in another case a man was ordered to pay a fee for taking it too far by leaving physical injuries on his beaten wife.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">[https://www.hrw.org/news/2010/10/19/uae-spousal-abuse-never-right, UAE: Spousal Abuse Never a 'Right' Further to this in 2010].</ref>\n\nFurthermore, there is growing concern at the UAE's lack of action against domestic violence.

In 2014 a [[Human Rights Watch]] report spoke to domestic workers who complained about abuse and not being paid due earnings, getting rest periods or days off and excessive workloads as well as documented cases of psychological, physical and sexual abuse.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/10/22/united-arab-emirates-trapped-exploited-abused,|title=Exploited migrant workers in the UAE}}</ref> The report documents how the visa sponsorship system, or [[Islamic adoptional jurisprudence|kafala]], and the lack of labour protections leaves migrant workers exposed to abuse.\n\nThe kafala system ties a migrant worker to their employers, who act as their sponsors and makes it difficult for them to change employers. If a domestic worker attempts to leave her sponsor before the end of her contract without her sponsor's approval she will be deemed to have \"absconded\" which usually results in fines and deportation.<ref>Article 95 and 96(a) of Executive Regulations of the Entry and Residence of Foreigners Law</ref>\n\nFederal law No.8 excludes domestic workers from labour laws and the environment which they work in is not regulated by the Ministry of Labour. This means domestic migrant workers have fewer rights than other migrant workers. In 2012 the government stated that the cabinet had approved a bill on domestic workers, however, Human Rights Watch has received no response to requests to obtain a draft.<ref>Human Rights Watch, \"'I Already Bought you': Abuse and Exploitation of Female Migrant Domestic Workers in the United Arab Emirates,\" p.29</ref>\n\nIn January 2016, Amnesty international said UAE government continues to violate rights of migrant workers in the country. The international organization said workers have been tied with [[Kafala system|Kafalah]] system and denied collective bargaining rights. Amnesty also said that women workers from Asia and Africa are explicitly excluded from labour law protections and particularly vulnerable to serious abuses, including forced labour and human trafficking.<ref name=\"amnestyMENA\"/>\n\nIn March 2019, the [[Human Rights Watch]] reported that eight [[Lebanese people|Lebanese nationals]] have been detained by the Emirati authorities on the accusations of terrorism charges, without any evidence.
