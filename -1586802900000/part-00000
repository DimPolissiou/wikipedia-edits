In Italy, the theorem is also known as '''theorem of Carabinieri'''.\n\nThe squeeze theorem is used in calculus and [[mathematical analysis]].

The correctness of which for positive x can be seen by simple geometric reasoning (see drawing) that can be extended to negative x as well. The second limit follows from the squeeze theorem and the fact that\n\n: <math> 0 \\leq  \\frac{1 - \\cos(x)}{x}  \\leq  x </math>\nfor ''x'' close enough to 0. This can be derived by replacing <math>\\sin(x)</math> in the earlier fact by <math>\\sqrt{1-\\cos(x)^2}</math> and squaring the resulting inequality.\n\nThese two limits are used in proofs of the fact that the derivative of the sine function is the cosine function.  That fact is relied on in other proofs of derivatives of trigonometric functions.\n\n=== Third example ===\n\nIt is possible to show that\n\n: <math> \\frac{d}{d\\theta} \\tan\\theta = \\sec^2\\theta </math>\n\nby squeezing, as follows.\n\n[[File:Tangent.squeeze.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|right]]\n\nIn the illustration at right, the area of the smaller of the two shaded sectors of the circle is\n\n: <math> \\frac{\\sec^2\\theta\\,\\Delta\\theta}{2}, </math>\n\nsince the radius is sec&nbsp;''&theta;'' and the arc on the [[unit circle]] has length&nbsp;\u0394''&theta;''.  Similarly, the area of the larger of the two shaded sectors is\n\n: <math> \\frac{\\sec^2(\\theta + \\Delta\\theta)\\,\\Delta\\theta}{2}. </math>\n\nWhat is squeezed between them is the triangle whose base is the vertical segment whose endpoints are the two dots.  The length of the base of the triangle is&nbsp;tan(''&theta;''&nbsp;+&nbsp;\u0394''&theta;'')&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;tan(''&theta;''), and the height is&nbsp;1.  The area of the triangle is therefore\n\n: <math> \\frac{\\tan(\\theta + \\Delta\\theta) - \\tan(\\theta)}{2}. </math>\n\nFrom the inequalities\n\n: <math> \\frac{\\sec^2\\theta\\,\\Delta\\theta}{2} \\le \\frac{\\tan(\\theta + \\Delta\\theta) - \\tan(\\theta)}{2} \\le \\frac{\\sec^2(\\theta + \\Delta\\theta)\\,\\Delta\\theta}{2} </math>\n\nwe deduce that\n\n: <math> \\sec^2\\theta \\le \\frac{\\tan(\\theta + \\Delta\\theta) - \\tan(\\theta)}{\\Delta\\theta} \\le \\sec^2(\\theta + \\Delta\\theta),</math>\n\nprovided&nbsp;\u0394''&theta;''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0, and the inequalities are reversed if&nbsp;\u0394''&theta;''&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.

Indeed, if <math display=\"inline\">a</math> is an endpoint of <math display=\"inline\">I</math>, then the above limits are left- or right-hand limits.\n* A similar statement holds for infinite intervals: for example, if <math display=\"inline\">I=(0, \\infty)</math>, then the conclusion holds, taking the limits as <math display=\"inline\">x \\rightarrow \\infty</math>.\nThis theorem is also valid for sequences. Let <math>(a_n), (c_n)</math> be two sequences converging to <math>\\ell</math>, and <math>(b_n)</math> a sequence. If <math>\\forall n\\geqslant N, N\\in\\mathbb{N}</math> we have <math>a_n\\leqslant b_n\\leqslant c_n</math>, then <math>(b_n)</math> also converges to <math>\\ell</math>.\n\n===Proof===\nFrom the above hypotheses we have, taking the [[limit inferior]] and superior:\n:<math>L=\\lim_{x \\to a} g(x)\\leq\\liminf_{x\\to a}f(x) \\leq  \\limsup_{x\\to a}f(x)\\leq \\lim_{x \\to a}h(x)=L,</math>\nso all the inequalities are indeed equalities, and the thesis immediately follows.\n\nA direct proof, using the <math>(\\epsilon, \\delta)</math>-definition of limit, would be to prove that for all real <math display=\"inline\">\\epsilon > 0</math> there exists a real <math>\\delta > 0</math> such that for all <math>x</math> with <math>|x - a| < \\delta</math>, we have <math>|f(x) - L| < \\epsilon</math>. Symbolically,\n\n: <math> \\forall \\epsilon > 0, \\exists \\delta > 0 : \\forall x, (|x - a | < \\delta \\ \\Rightarrow  |f(x) - L |< \\epsilon).</math>\n\nAs\n\n: <math>\\lim_{x \\to a} g(x) = L </math>\n\nmeans that\n\n: <math> \\forall \\varepsilon > 0, \\exists \\ \\delta_1 > 0 : \\forall x\\ (|x - a| < \\delta_1 \\ \\Rightarrow \\ |g(x) - L |< \\varepsilon).\\qquad (1)</math>\n\nand \n: <math>\\lim_{x \\to a} h(x) = L </math>\n\nmeans that\n\n: <math> \\forall \\varepsilon > 0, \\exists \\ \\delta_2 > 0 : \\forall x\\ (|x - a | < \\delta_2\\ \\Rightarrow \\ |h(x) - L |< \\varepsilon),\\qquad (2)</math>\n\nthen we have\n\n: <math>g(x) \\leq f(x) \\leq h(x) </math>\n: <math>g(x) - L\\leq f(x) - L\\leq h(x) - L</math>\n\nWe can choose <math>\\delta:=\\min\\left\\{\\delta_1,\\delta_2\\right\\}</math>. Then, if <math>|x - a|<\\delta</math>, combining (1) and (2), we have\n\n: <math> - \\varepsilon < g(x) - L\\leq f(x) - L\\leq h(x) - L\\ < \\varepsilon, </math>\n: <math> - \\varepsilon < f(x) - L < \\varepsilon </math>,\n\nwhich completes the proof.  <math>\\blacksquare</math>\n\nThe proof for sequences is very similar, using the <math>\\epsilon</math>-definition of a limit of a sequence.\n\n== Statement for series ==\nThere is also the squeeze theorem for series, which can be stated as follows:{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n<blockquote>Let <math>\\sum_n a_n, \\sum_n c_n</math> be two convergent series. If <math>\\exists N\\in\\mathbb{N} </math> such that <math>\\forall n>N, a_n\\leqslant b_n \\leqslant c_n </math>then <math>\\sum_n b_n </math> also converges.</blockquote>\n\n=== Proof ===\nLet <math>\\sum_n a_n, \\sum_n c_n</math> be two convergent series. Hence, the sequences <math>\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^n a_n\\right)_{n=1}^{\\infty}, \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^n c_n\\right)_{n=1}^{\\infty} </math> are Cauchy. That is, for fixed <math>\\epsilon>0 </math>,\n\n<math>\\exists N_1\\in\\mathbb{N} </math> such that <math>\\forall n>m>N_1, \\left|\\sum_{k=1}^na_n-\\sum_{k=1}^ma_n\\right|<\\epsilon \\Longrightarrow \\left|\\sum_{k=m+1}^n a_n\\right|<\\epsilon \\Longrightarrow -\\epsilon<\\sum_{k=m+1}^n a_n<\\epsilon </math> (1)\n\nand similarly <math>\\exists N_2\\in\\mathbb{N} </math> such that <math>\\forall n>m>N_2, \\left|\\sum_{k=1}^nc_n-\\sum_{k=1}^mc_n\\right|<\\epsilon \\Longrightarrow \\left|\\sum_{k=m+1}^n c_n\\right|<\\epsilon \\Longrightarrow -\\epsilon<\\sum_{k=m+1}^n c_n<\\epsilon </math> (2).\n\nWe know that <math>\\exists N_3\\in\\mathbb{N} </math> such that <math>\\forall n>N_3, a_n\\leqslant b_n \\leqslant c_n </math>. Hence, <math>\\forall n>m>\\max\\{N_1,N_2,N_3\\} </math>, we have combining (1) and (2):\n\n<math>a_n\\leqslant b_n\\leqslant c_n \\Longrightarrow \\sum_{k=m+1}^n a_n \\leqslant \\sum_{k=m+1}^n b_n \\leqslant \\sum_{k=m+1}^n c_n \\Longrightarrow -\\epsilon< \\sum_{k=m+1}^n b_n <\\epsilon \\Longrightarrow \\left|\\sum_{k=m+1}^n b_n\\right|<\\epsilon \\Longrightarrow \\left|\\sum_{k=1}^n b_n-\\sum_{k=1}^m b_n\\right|<\\epsilon </math>.\n\nTherefore <math>\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^n b_n\\right)_{n=1}^{\\infty} </math>is a Cauchy sequence. So <math>\\sum_n b_n </math> converges. <math>\\blacksquare</math>\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== First example ===\n\n[[File:Inst_satsen.png|thumb|right|250px|''x''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;sin(1/''x'') being squeezed in the limit as x goes to 0]]\n\nThe limit\n\n: <math>\\lim_{x \\to 0}x^2 \\sin(\\tfrac{1}{x})</math>\n\ncannot be determined through the limit law\n\n: <math>\\lim_{x \\to a}(f(x)\\cdot g(x)) = \n\\lim_{x \\to a}f(x)\\cdot \\lim_{x \\to a}g(x),</math>\n\nbecause\n\n: <math>\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\sin(\\tfrac{1}{x})</math>\n\ndoes not exist.\n\nHowever, by the definition of the [[sine function]],\n\n: <math>-1 \\le \\sin(\\tfrac{1}{x}) \\le 1. </math>\n\nIt follows that\n\n: <math>-x^2 \\le x^2 \\sin(\\tfrac{1}{x}) \\le x^2 </math>\n\nSince <math>\\lim_{x\\to 0}-x^2 = \\lim_{x\\to 0}x^2 = 0</math>, by the squeeze theorem, <math>\\lim_{x\\to 0} x^2 \\sin(\\tfrac{1}{x})</math> must also be 0.\n\n=== Second example ===\n[[File:Limit_sin_x_x.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Comparing areas:<br/><math>\\begin{align}&\\, A(\\triangle ADF) \\geq A(\\text{sector}\\, ADB) \\geq A(\\triangle ADB)\\\\ \\Rightarrow &\\, \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\tan(x)\\cdot 1 \\geq \\frac{x}{2\\pi}\\cdot \\pi \\geq \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\sin(x)\\cdot 1\\\\ \\Rightarrow &\\, \\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\cos(x)} \\geq x \\geq \\sin(x)\\\\ \\Rightarrow &\\, \\frac{\\cos(x)}{\\sin(x)} \\leq \\frac{1}{x} \\leq \\frac{1}{\\sin(x)} \\\\ \\Rightarrow &\\, \\cos(x) \\leq \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x} \\leq 1 \\end{align} </math>]]\nProbably the best-known examples of finding a limit by squeezing are the proofs of the equalities\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x} =1, \\\\[10pt]\n& \\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{1 - \\cos(x)}{x} = 0.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe first limit follows by means of the squeeze theorem from the fact that\n\n: <math> \\cos x \\leq \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x} \\leq 1 </math><ref>Selim G.

The correctness of which for positive x can be seen by simple geometric reasoning (see drawing) that can be extended to negative x as well. The second limit follows from the squeeze theorem and the fact that\n\n: <math> 0 \\leq  \\frac{1 - \\cos(x)}{x}  \\leq  x </math>\nfor ''x'' close enough to 0. This can be derived by replacing <math>\\sin(x)</math> in the earlier fact by <math>\\sqrt{1-\\cos(x)^2}</math> and squaring the resulting inequality.\n\nThese two limits are used in proofs of the fact that the derivative of the sine function is the cosine function.  That fact is relied on in other proofs of derivatives of trigonometric functions.\n\n=== Third example ===\n\nIt is possible to show that\n\n: <math> \\frac{d}{d\\theta} \\tan\\theta = \\sec^2\\theta </math>\n\nby squeezing, as follows.\n\n[[File:Tangent.squeeze.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|right]]\n\nIn the illustration at right, the area of the smaller of the two shaded sectors of the circle is\n\n: <math> \\frac{\\sec^2\\theta\\,\\Delta\\theta}{2}, </math>\n\nsince the radius is sec&nbsp;''&theta;'' and the arc on the [[unit circle]] has length&nbsp;\u0394''&theta;''.  Similarly, the area of the larger of the two shaded sectors is\n\n: <math> \\frac{\\sec^2(\\theta + \\Delta\\theta)\\,\\Delta\\theta}{2}. </math>\n\nWhat is squeezed between them is the triangle whose base is the vertical segment whose endpoints are the two dots.  The length of the base of the triangle is&nbsp;tan(''&theta;''&nbsp;+&nbsp;\u0394''&theta;'')&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;tan(''&theta;''), and the height is&nbsp;1.  The area of the triangle is therefore\n\n: <math> \\frac{\\tan(\\theta + \\Delta\\theta) - \\tan(\\theta)}{2}. </math>\n\nFrom the inequalities\n\n: <math> \\frac{\\sec^2\\theta\\,\\Delta\\theta}{2} \\le \\frac{\\tan(\\theta + \\Delta\\theta) - \\tan(\\theta)}{2} \\le \\frac{\\sec^2(\\theta + \\Delta\\theta)\\,\\Delta\\theta}{2} </math>\n\nwe deduce that\n\n: <math> \\sec^2\\theta \\le \\frac{\\tan(\\theta + \\Delta\\theta) - \\tan(\\theta)}{\\Delta\\theta} \\le \\sec^2(\\theta + \\Delta\\theta),</math>\n\nprovided&nbsp;\u0394''&theta;''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0, and the inequalities are reversed if&nbsp;\u0394''&theta;''&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.  Since the first and third expressions approach sec<sup>2</sup>''&theta;'' as \u0394''&theta;''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;0, and the middle expression approaches (''d''/''d&theta;'')&nbsp;tan&nbsp;''&theta;'', the desired result follows.\n\n=== Fourth example ===\n\nThe squeeze theorem can still be used in multivariable calculus but the lower (and upper functions) must be below (and above) the target function not just along a path but around the entire neighborhood of the point of interest and it only works if the function really does have a limit there. It can, therefore, be used to prove that a function has a limit at a point, but it can never be used to prove that a function does not have a limit at a point.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Chapter 15.2 Limits and Continuity|pages=909\u2013910|title=Multivariable Calculus|year=2008|last1=Stewart|first1=James|authorlink1=James_Stewart_(mathematician)|edition=6th|isbn=0495011630}}</ref>\n\n: <math>\\lim_{(x,y) \\to (0, 0)} \\frac{x^2 y}{x^2+y^2}</math>\n\ncannot be found by taking any number of limits along paths that pass through the point, but since\n\n: <math>0 \\leq \\frac{x^2}{x^2+y^2} \\leq 1</math>\n: <math>-\\left | y \\right \\vert \\leq y \\leq \\left | y \\right \\vert </math>\n: <math>-\\left | y \\right \\vert \\leq \\frac{x^2 y}{x^2+y^2} \\leq \\left | y \\right \\vert </math>\n: <math>\\lim_{(x,y) \\to (0, 0)} -\\left | y \\right \\vert = 0</math>\n: <math>\\lim_{(x,y) \\to (0, 0)} \\left |y \\right \\vert = 0</math>\n: <math>0  \\leq  \\lim_{(x,y) \\to (0, 0)} \\frac{x^2 y}{x^2+y^2}  \\leq  0</math>\n\ntherefore, by the squeeze theorem,\n\n: <math>\\lim_{(x,y) \\to (0, 0)} \\frac{x^2 y}{x^2+y^2} = 0</math>\n\n== References ==\n{{refimprove|date=April 2010}}\n<references />\n\n== External links ==\n* {{MathWorld |title=Squeezing Theorem |urlname=SqueezingTheorem}}\n* [http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/SqueezeTheorem/ Squeeze Theorem] by Bruce Atwood (Beloit College) after work by, Selwyn Hollis (Armstrong Atlantic State University), the [[Wolfram Demonstrations Project]].\n* [https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Squeeze_Theorem Squeeze Theorem] on ProofWiki.\n\n{{Portal bar|Mathematics}}\n\n[[Category:Limits (mathematics)]]\n[[Category:Functions and mappings]]\n[[Category:Articles containing proofs]]\n[[Category:Theorems in calculus]]\n[[Category:Theorems in real analysis]]\n", "name_user": "Dario606", "label": "safe", "comment": "Citation should not be needed for translation, it is easily verifiable.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeeze_theorem"}

The character was created by [[Hideo Kojima]] and designed by [[Yoji Shinkawa]], and was introduced in the series as the main [[player character]] of the 2001 [[stealth game]] ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]''. In ''Metal Gear Solid 2'', Raiden appears to be a member of the U.S. special operations unit [[FOXHOUND]] and is participating in his first mission against terrorists. Despite coming across as a rookie, he is a young soldier who is later revealed to have been a Liberian [[child soldier]]. Raiden also appears as a supporting character in ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]'', in which he is assisting the series' protagonist [[Solid Snake]] in his fight against [[Revolver Ocelot]]'s forces. He is also the main character of the [[hack and slash]] game ''[[Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance]]'', in which he is dealing with his past and his present life as a combatant who faces enemies from [[private military companies]].\n\nRaiden, who was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories and a fan's letter wanting a younger character to be featured in the series, originated from Hideo Kojima's desire to view Solid Snake from a different point of view. Raiden's inclusion in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was kept secret from gamers before his debut; despite some players' reactions, the staff liked the character. To appeal to fans of the series who initially disliked Raiden, the character was redesigned for ''Metal Gear Solid 4''. He was again redesigned for both the cancelled game ''Metal Gear Solid: Rising'' and its reboot ''Revengeance'' to portray a darker side of his character. In Japanese, the character is voiced by  [[Kenyu Horiuchi]] and in English by [[Quinton Flynn]].\n\nRaiden's debut role as the protagonist of ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was controversial, however, due to his unexpected substitution for the established hero Solid Snake. Some critics defended the character, stating that fans were merely angered by the former's removal and that the latter was appealing. Despite this mixed reception, Raiden has been praised for his role and ''Metal Gear Solid 4'' redesign especially in his fight scene, and more for his role and design in ''Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance'' where he was found as a better character than in previous installments.\n\n==Character design==\n===Initial concept===\n{{multiple image\n | footer    = Hideo Kojima created Raiden while Yoji Shinkawa designed him.\n | image1    = Hideo Kojima - Tokyo Game Show 2011 (1) (cropped).jpg\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  =  \n | width1    = 170\n | image2    = Yoji Shinkawa.png\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =\n | width2    = 150\n}}\nAccording to series creator [[Hideo Kojima]], the decision to make a new character to replace Solid Snake for most of ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' stemmed from the developer's desire to develop Snake from a third-person perspective. Kojima stated that Raiden's character and his perception by the audience were important to the overall feel of the story. The idea of having a second main character was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] short stories and novels in which the narrator is [[Dr. Watson]] rather than Holmes. Kojima said Snake was the game's protagonist rather than Raiden. Yoshikazu Matsuhana, assistant director for the project, was uncertain about this decision; he considered Raiden a \"weak-looking character\" but decided to follow Kojima.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Final Hours of Metal Gear Solid 2|website=[[GameSpot]]|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103100148/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|accessdate=July 3, 2011|archivedate=January 3, 2006}}</ref> The codename \"Raiden\" was based on that of the [[Mitsubishi J2M|Mitsubishi J2M Raiden]], a historical combat aircraft of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]].

Originally, to defeat Solidus, Raiden must cut off both his mechanical snake-like arms, then he must attack Solidus' back and sever the back bone vertebra connection, rendering Solidus no longer mobile. Following this, Raiden would finish Solidus by decapitating him similar to samurai fashion. The scene was rejected and instead Raiden would slice Solidus' stomach, another idea taken from samurais. However, this concept was also scrapped to simply Raiden slicing Solidus' vertebral column with the boss falling from the area to give the idea he could not accept his defeat.<ref name=\"production\">{{cite web|url=https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709185620/https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|title=Metal Gear Solid 2 Production|archivedate=July 9, 2013|accessdate=August 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Konami]] kept Raiden's starring role in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' secret until the game's North American release; the company replaced Raiden with Snake in teaser trailers and other preview materials.

name {{nihongo|Jack|\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30af|Jakku}}, is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] and one of the main protagonists of [[Konami]]'s ''[[Metal Gear]]'' series of video games. The character was created by [[Hideo Kojima]] and designed by [[Yoji Shinkawa]], and was introduced in the series as the main [[player character]] of the 2001 [[stealth game]] ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]''. In ''Metal Gear Solid 2'', Raiden appears to be a member of the U.S. special operations unit [[FOXHOUND]] and is participating in his first mission against terrorists. Despite coming across as a rookie, he is a young soldier who is later revealed to have been a Liberian [[child soldier]]. Raiden also appears as a supporting character in ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]'', in which he is assisting the series' protagonist [[Solid Snake]] in his fight against [[Revolver Ocelot]]'s forces. He is also the main character of the [[hack and slash]] game ''[[Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance]]'', in which he is dealing with his past and his present life as a combatant who faces enemies from [[private military companies]].\n\nRaiden, who was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories and a fan's letter wanting a younger character to be featured in the series, originated from Hideo Kojima's desire to view Solid Snake from a different point of view. Raiden's inclusion in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was kept secret from gamers before his debut; despite some players' reactions, the staff liked the character. To appeal to fans of the series who initially disliked Raiden, the character was redesigned for ''Metal Gear Solid 4''. He was again redesigned for both the cancelled game ''Metal Gear Solid: Rising'' and its reboot ''Revengeance'' to portray a darker side of his character. In Japanese, the character is voiced by  [[Kenyu Horiuchi]] and in English by [[Quinton Flynn]].\n\nRaiden's debut role as the protagonist of ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was controversial, however, due to his unexpected substitution for the established hero Solid Snake. Some critics defended the character, stating that fans were merely angered by the former's removal and that the latter was appealing. Despite this mixed reception, Raiden has been praised for his role and ''Metal Gear Solid 4'' redesign especially in his fight scene, and more for his role and design in ''Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance'' where he was found as a better character than in previous installments.\n\n==Character design==\n===Initial concept===\n{{multiple image\n | footer    = Hideo Kojima created Raiden while Yoji Shinkawa designed him.\n | image1    = Hideo Kojima - Tokyo Game Show 2011 (1) (cropped).jpg\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  =  \n | width1    = 170\n | image2    = Yoji Shinkawa.png\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =\n | width2    = 150\n}}\nAccording to series creator [[Hideo Kojima]], the decision to make a new character to replace Solid Snake for most of ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' stemmed from the developer's desire to develop Snake from a third-person perspective. Kojima stated that Raiden's character and his perception by the audience were important to the overall feel of the story. The idea of having a second main character was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] short stories and novels in which the narrator is [[Dr. Watson]] rather than Holmes.

{"title_page": "Papal mediation in the Beagle conflict", "text_new": "{{Beaglenav}}\n\n[[File:Cassaroli-1984-treaty.jpg|thumb|300px|Signing of the agreement in Rome: Argentine Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Dante Caputo]] (left); Agostino Casaroli (middle); Chilean Minister of Foreign Affairs Jaime del Valle (right)]]\n\nThe '''Papal mediation in the Beagle conflict''' followed the failure of [[Direct negotiations between Chile and Argentina in 1977\u20131978|negotiations between Chile and Argentina]], when, on 22 December 1978, the Argentinian [[Military dictatorship|Junta]] started [[Operation Soberan\u00eda]], to invade [[Cape Horn]] and islands awarded to Chile by the [[Beagle Channel Arbitration]]. Soon after the event, [[Pope John Paul II]] offered to [[mediation|mediate]] and sent his personal envoy, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Antonio Samor\u00e9]], to [[Buenos Aires]]. Argentina, in acceptance of the authority of the Pope over the overwhelmingly Catholic Argentine population, called off the military operation and accepted the mediation. On 9 January 1979, Chile and Argentina signed the [https://www.un.org/Depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/TREATIES/CHL-ARG1979AM.PDF Act of Montevideo] formally requesting mediation by the Vatican and renouncing the use of force.\n\n== Interests of the parties ==\n{{Main|Beagle conflict#Interests of the parties|l1=Interests of the parties}}\nThe mediator acted to defuse the situation by negotiating an agreement that stopped the immediate military crisis. Then the Vatican crafted a six-year process that allowed the parties to grapple with increasingly difficult issues, including navigation rights, sovereignty over other islands in the [[Fuegian Archipelago]], [[delimitation]] of the [[Straits of Magellan]], and maritime boundaries south to [[Cape Horn]] and beyond.\n* Chile considered the Arbitral Award of 1977 \"\u2026fully operative and obligatory in law\u2026\" as expressed by the Court of Arbitration after the Argentine Refusal.<ref>See \"Der Schiedsspruch in der Beagle-Kanal-Streitigkeit\", Karin Oellers-Frahm, Page 353</ref>\n* Argentina repudiated the International Arbitral Award that the government of [[Alejandro Lanusse]] had solicited in 1971.\n* Argentina extended its claim to all territories southward of [[Tierra del Fuego]] and eastward of the Cape Horn-[[meridian (geography)|meridian]]. That is, Argentina claimed the islands Horn, Wollastone, Deceit, Barnevelt, Evouts, Herschell, etc.\n\nThe 1978 military mobilization revealed other latent international relations issues between the two countries that had been previously overlooked or ignored.\n\n== Mediator ==\nBy the beginning of November 1978, Chile and Argentina no longer had any mechanism for working toward a peaceful settlement and the situation began to destabilize rapidly. It was at this point, with direct talks dead and a judicial settlement refused by Argentina, that Chile suggested mediation. Argentina accepted the proposal and the two foreign ministers agreed to meet in Buenos Aires on 12 December for the purpose of selecting a mediator and the terms of mediation. Possible candidates were<ref>See Alejandro Luis Corbacho: Predicting the Probability of War During Brinkmanship Crises: The Beagle and the Malvinas Conflicts, Universidad del CEMA, Argentina, Documento de Trabajo No. 244, September 2003, page 8</ref>\n* [[Jimmy Carter]], [[President of the United States of America]],\n* the [[Organization of American States]],\n* [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]], [[King of Spain]],\n* a European president,\n* Pope John Paul II.\nThe ministers concurred on the issue that the Pope should mediate the dispute, but their agreement proved ephemeral. In the evening, as the Chilean delegation was studying the documents for signature, the Argentine minister called the Chilean minister Cubillos to tell him that President Videla, who had approved their choice of mediator, had been stripped of his authority by the junta.\n\nOn 22 December 1978, Argentina launched [[Operation Soberania]] to occupy the islands militarily. On the morning of 22 December, Pope John Paul II, on his own initiative, contacted both governments directly to communicate that he was sending a personal envoy to Buenos Aires and Santiago.\n<gallery caption=\"Mediator and the heads of state\" align=\"center\">\nFile:Argentina.RaulAlfonsin.01.jpg|[[Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn]], Argentine Head of State\nFile:JohannesPaul2-portrait.jpg|[[Pope John Paul II]], mediator between Chile and Argentina\nFile:Pinochet crop.jpg|[[Augusto Pinochet]], Chilean Head of State\n</gallery>\n\n== The Act of Montevideo ==\nIn [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], on 8 January 1979, both countries signed the Act of Montevideo. In this treaty the parties agreed to:\n* no restrictions whatsoever over the mediation (textual: ''\u00ab\u2026they will raise no objection to the expression by the Holy See, during these proceedings, of such ideas as its thorough studies on a disputed aspects of the problem of the southern zone may suggest to it, with a view to contributing to a peaceful settlement acceptable to both Parties\u2026\u00bb'')\n* ''\u00ab\u2026Antonio Cardinal Samor\u00e9 \u2026 asks that that request ''[of mediation]'' should be accompanied by an undertaking that the two States will not resort to the use of force in their mutual relations, will bring about a gradual return to the military situation existing at the beginning of 1977 and will refrain from adopting measures that might impair harmony in any sector.\u2026\u00bb''.\n\nThe treaty gave the mediator a broad framework in which to negotiate without any geographical data or temporal restrictions.\n[[File:PopeJohannesPaul-Mediator.png|thumb|400px|right|Pope John Paul II, the Chilean and the Argentine delegations at the beginning of the mediation, 1979.

This was purely a crisis intervention to prevent a war and secure an agreement to submit the matter to mediation. In a shuttle diplomacy, Samor\u00e8 flew between [[Santiago de Chile]] and Buenos Aires until the objectives were achieved with the signing of the Act of Montevideo on 8 January 1979.\n* The second period ran from May 1979, when the Chilean and Argentine delegations arrived in Rome, through December 1980, when the Pope presented the parties with his proposal for settling the dispute. This first proposal was rejected by Argentina.\n* The third and longest phase, running from the beginning of 1981 until December 1983, after Argentina's return to democracy, was characterized by long periods of stalled negotiations. The most significant developments during this period were the Argentine repudiation of the 1972 General Treaty; the subsequent effort to fill the juridical vacuum resulting from that repudiation; and the [[Falklands war]], which set the stage for the return to democracy in Argentina.\n* The final phase began when [[Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn]] assumed the presidency in Buenos Aires at the end of 1983 and ended with the signing of the 1984 Treaty of Peace and Friendship.\n\n== The papal proposal of 1980 ==\n[[File:Pope1980prop.png|thumb|200px|right|The papal proposal of 1980.]]\nOn 12 December 1980, the Pope received both delegations and communicated to them his proposal for resolving the controversy, the terms of which had been developed entirely in secret and should be kept secret in order to avoid debilitating public debate that might diminish confidence in the proceedings and limit the freedom of action of both governments. But on 22 August 1981 the Argentine newspaper ''[[La Naci\u00f3n]]'' published the terms of the proposal. Chile would retain all of the islands and Argentina would be entitled to maintain certain limited facilities (common radar and weather stations) on some islands and would receive important navigation rights. Most important, however, was the creation of an ocean area known as the Sea of Peace. In this area, extending to the east and southeast from the disputed chain of islands, Chilean territorial waters would be limited to a narrow territorial sea, in which it would be obliged to share with Argentina equal participation in resource exploitation, scientific investigation, and environmental management. Beyond the Chilean territorial waters would be a much broader band of ocean subject to Argentine jurisdiction, but also subject to the same sharing provisions that applied in Chilean waters.\n\nChile accepted the papal proposal, despite some reservations. Argentina never formally replied to the proposal. However, on 17 March 1981, Argentina delivered a note to the Vatican expressing grave misgivings about the proposal, both because it failed to award any islands to Argentina and because it allowed Chile to maintain a presence so far into the Atlantic.\n\n== Argentina renounced a 1972 Arbitration treaty ==\nOn 21 January 1982, Argentina announced the withdrawal from the 1972 bilateral treaty providing for recourse to the [[International Court of Justice]] in case of disputes.

Soon after the event, [[Pope John Paul II]] offered to [[mediation|mediate]] and sent his personal envoy, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Antonio Samor\u00e9]], to [[Buenos Aires]]. Argentina, in acceptance of the authority of the Pope over the overwhelmingly Catholic Argentine population, called off the military operation and accepted the mediation. On 9 January 1979, Chile and Argentina signed the [https://www.un.org/Depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/TREATIES/CHL-ARG1979AM.PDF Act of Montevideo] formally requesting mediation by the Vatican and renouncing the use of force.\n\n== Interests of the parties ==\n{{Main|Beagle conflict#Interests of the parties|l1=Interests of the parties}}\nThe mediator acted to defuse the situation by negotiating an agreement that stopped the immediate military crisis. Then, the Vatican crafted a six-year process that allowed the parties to grapple with increasingly difficult issues, including navigation rights, sovereignty over other islands in the [[Fuegian Archipelago]], [[delimitation]] of the [[Straits of Magellan]], and maritime boundaries south to [[Cape Horn]] and beyond.\n* Chile considered the Arbitral Award of 1977 \"\u2026fully operative and obligatory in law\u2026\" as expressed by the Court of Arbitration after the Argentine Refusal.<ref>See \"Der Schiedsspruch in der Beagle-Kanal-Streitigkeit\", Karin Oellers-Frahm, Page 353</ref>\n* Argentina repudiated the International Arbitral Award that the government of [[Alejandro Lanusse]] had solicited in 1971.\n* Argentina extended its claim to all territories southward of [[Tierra del Fuego]] and eastward of the Cape Horn-[[meridian (geography)|meridian]]. That is, Argentina claimed the islands Horn, Wollastone, Deceit, Barnevelt, Evouts, Herschell, etc.\n\nThe 1978 military mobilization revealed other latent international relations issues between the two countries that had been previously overlooked or ignored.\n\n== Mediator ==\nBy the beginning of November 1978, Chile and Argentina no longer had any mechanism for working toward a peaceful settlement and the situation began to destabilize rapidly. It was at this point, with direct talks dead and a judicial settlement refused by Argentina, that Chile suggested mediation. Argentina accepted the proposal and the two foreign ministers agreed to meet in Buenos Aires on 12 December for the purpose of selecting a mediator and the terms of mediation. Possible candidates were<ref>See Alejandro Luis Corbacho: Predicting the Probability of War During Brinkmanship Crises: The Beagle and the Malvinas Conflicts, Universidad del CEMA, Argentina, Documento de Trabajo No. 244, September 2003, page 8</ref>\n* [[Jimmy Carter]], [[President of the United States of America]],\n* the [[Organization of American States]],\n* [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]], [[King of Spain]],\n* a European president,\n* Pope John Paul II.\nThe ministers concurred on the issue that the Pope should mediate the dispute, but their agreement proved ephemeral. In the evening, as the Chilean delegation was studying the documents for signature, the Argentine minister called the Chilean minister Cubillos to tell him that President Videla, who had approved their choice of mediator, had been stripped of his authority by the junta.\n\nOn 22 December 1978, Argentina launched [[Operation Soberania]] to occupy the islands militarily. On the morning of 22 December, Pope John Paul II, on his own initiative, contacted both governments directly to communicate that he was sending a personal envoy to Buenos Aires and Santiago.\n<gallery caption=\"Mediator and the heads of state\" align=\"center\">\nFile:Argentina.RaulAlfonsin.01.jpg|[[Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn]], Argentine Head of State\nFile:JohannesPaul2-portrait.jpg|[[Pope John Paul II]], mediator between Chile and Argentina\nFile:Pinochet crop.jpg|[[Augusto Pinochet]], Chilean Head of State\n</gallery>\n\n== The Act of Montevideo ==\nIn [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], on 8 January 1979, both countries signed the Act of Montevideo.

This was purely a crisis intervention to prevent a war and secure an agreement to submit the matter to mediation. In a shuttle diplomacy, Samor\u00e8 flew between [[Santiago de Chile]] and Buenos Aires until the objectives were achieved with the signing of the Act of Montevideo on 8 January 1979.\n* The second period ran from May 1979, when the Chilean and Argentine delegations arrived in Rome, through December 1980, when the Pope presented the parties with his proposal for settling the dispute. This first proposal was rejected by Argentina.\n* The third and longest phase, running from the beginning of 1981 until December 1983, after Argentina's return to democracy, was characterized by long periods of stalled negotiations. The most significant developments during this period were the Argentine repudiation of the 1972 General Treaty; the subsequent effort to fill the juridical vacuum resulting from that repudiation; and the [[Falklands war]], which set the stage for the return to democracy in Argentina.\n* The final phase began when [[Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn]] assumed the presidency in Buenos Aires at the end of 1983 and ended with the signing of the 1984 Treaty of Peace and Friendship.\n\n== The papal proposal of 1980 ==\n[[File:Pope1980prop.png|thumb|200px|right|The papal proposal of 1980.]]\nOn 12 December 1980, the Pope received both delegations and communicated to them his proposal for resolving the controversy, the terms of which had been developed entirely in secret and should be kept secret in order to avoid debilitating public debate that might diminish confidence in the proceedings and limit the freedom of action of both governments. But on 22 August 1981 the Argentine newspaper ''[[La Naci\u00f3n]]'' published the terms of the proposal. Chile would retain all of the islands and Argentina would be entitled to maintain certain limited facilities (common radar and weather stations) on some islands and would receive important navigation rights. Most important, however, was the creation of an ocean area known as the Sea of Peace. In this area, extending to the east and southeast from the disputed chain of islands, Chilean territorial waters would be limited to a narrow territorial sea, in which it would be obliged to share with Argentina equal participation in resource exploitation, scientific investigation, and environmental management. Beyond the Chilean territorial waters would be a much broader band of ocean subject to Argentine jurisdiction, but also subject to the same sharing provisions that applied in Chilean waters.\n\nChile accepted the papal proposal, despite some reservations. Argentina never formally replied to the proposal. However, on 17 March 1981, Argentina delivered a note to the Vatican expressing grave misgivings about the proposal, both because it failed to award any islands to Argentina and because it allowed Chile to maintain a presence so far into the Atlantic.\n\n== Argentina renounced a 1972 Arbitration treaty ==\nOn 21 January 1982, Argentina announced the withdrawal from the 1972 bilateral treaty providing for recourse to the [[International Court of Justice]] in case of disputes. In Argentina, the judicial process had become an [[anathema]], particularly in view of the adverse 1977 arbitration award.<ref>See Michael Morris, \"The Strait of Magellan\", Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1989, page 85</ref> Chile reserved the right to go to the ICJ unilaterally before the treaty ended on 27 December 1982.<ref>See article [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/CHILE/LATINOAMERICA/ARGENTINA/Argentina/denuncia/tratado/Chile/Beagle/elpepiint/19820123elpepiint_13/Tes Argentina denuncia el tratado con Chile sobre el Beagle] in Spanish newspaper ''[[El Pa\u00eds]]'' on 23 January 1982 (in Spanish).</ref>\n\n== To the Falklands war ==\nAfter the papal proposal, negotiations remained stalled and meanwhile, a sequence of incidents in Chile and Argentina strained relations between the two countries.\n\nOn 28 April 1981, General [[Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri]] (then Argentine army chief; later, during the Falklands war, President of Argentina) closed the border to Chile without any consultation with his own president.<ref>See article [http://www.clarin.com/suplementos/zona/1998/12/20/i-00801e.htm Historia de la santa mediaci\u00f3n] in Argentine newspaper ''[[Clar\u00edn (Argentine newspaper)|Clar\u00edn]]'', Buenos Aires, on 20 December 1998: \u00abMe calent\u00e9, se justific\u00f3 Galtieri ante el fastidiado comandante de la Marina, almirante Lambruschini, quien le pregunt\u00f3: Pero se da usted cuenta que el pa\u00eds se encuentra as\u00ed envuelto en una peligrosa escalada?\u00bb'' (Translation; I lost my cool, justify himself Galtieri, as the annoyed Chief of the Argentine Navy, Admiral Lambruschini, asked him: Don't you notice that it bring the country in a dangerous escalation?)</ref>\n\nIn March 1982, five weeks before the beginning of the Falklands war, a ship of the Argentine navy, [[USS Luiseno (ATF-156)|''ARA Francisco de Gurruchaga'']], anchored at the [[Cape Horn|Deceit island]], ''[[de facto]]'' under Chilean sovereignty since 1881, and refused to abandon the bay, despite Chilean demands.<ref>See article [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/CHILE/CANAL_DE_BEAGLE/LATINOAMERICA/ARGENTINA/Pinochet/ordena/acuartelamiento/tropas/chilenas/conflicto/Argentina/canal/Beagle/elpepiint/19820306elpepiint_4/Tes Pinochet ordena el acuartelamiento de las tropas chilenas por el conflicto con Argentina sobre el canal de Beagle] in Spanish newspaper ''[[El Pa\u00eds]]'' on 6 March 1982 (in Spanish).</ref><ref>William Ben Hunt, ''Getting to war: predicting international conflict with mass media indicators'', page 22</ref>\n\nOn 2 April 1982, Argentina [[Falklands War|invaded the Falkland Islands]].

Holsti, \"The state, war, and the state of war\", page 176</ref>\n\n== The final phase ==\nAfter the war, yet despite the renewal of the 1972 Treaty on 15 September 1982, the distension after ARA-Gurruchaga incident and the spy-exchanging, the mediation continued to move very slowly. Following the war Chile evinced a greater willingness to negotiate modifications to the papal proposal, but by then it had become clear that the Argentine junta, reeling from its defeat in the war, was too weak to achieve an agreement.\n\nCardinal Antonio Samor\u00e8 died in Rome at age 77, in February 1983.\n\nPresident [[Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn]]'s new government was firmly committed to resolve the conflict as quickly as possible. Based on this commitment and additional discussions, the parties were able to lay much of the groundwork for a settlement.\n\nIn April 1984, [[Vatican Secretary of State]] [[Agostino Casaroli]] asked separately the two delegations for their proposals for a final solution.\n\nBy October 1984, both countries reached a complete understanding, and the revised text of the treaty was finalized on 18 October.\n\nChile accepted, again, the papal proposal. In Argentina, Alfonsin held a consultative [[referendum]]. The official returns showed 10,391,019 voted in favor of the proposed treaty while 2,105,663 opposed it, a margin of 82 percent to 16 percent opposed, with 2 percent casting blank or null ballots.<ref>See article [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DE7D61638F935A15752C1A962948260 Beagle Channel Treaty Approved in Argentina] in USA-newspaper ''[[The New York Times]]'' on 26 November 1984</ref>\n\nThe [[Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina]] went a long way before enacted:\n* on 30 December 1984, the treaty passed the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies]];\n* on 15 March 1985, the treaty passed the [[Argentine Senate]];\n* on 16 March 1985, the treaty was signed by representative of the [[President of Argentina]], who was abroad;\n* on 11 April 1985, the treaty passed the Chilean [[Government Junta of Chile (1973)|junta]];\n* on 12 April 1985, the treaty was signed by [[Augusto Pinochet]];\n* on 2 May 1985, both ministers exchanged instruments.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe [[Cardenal Antonio Samor\u00e9 Pass]] crossing border was renamed to honour the special representative of Pope John Paul II.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Pope John Paul II]]\n* [[Antonio Samor\u00e9]]\n* [[Falklands War]]\n* [[Argentina-Chile relations]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* Beagle Channel Arbitration between the Republic of Argentina and the Republic of Chile, [http://legal.un.org/riaa/cases/vol_XXI/53-264.pdf ''Report and Decision of the Court of Arbitration'']\n* Mark Laudy: [https://web.archive.org/web/20080529153631/http://wwics.si.edu/subsites/ccpdc/pubs/words/11.pdf ''The Vatican Mediation of the Beagle Channel Dispute: Crisis Intervention and Forum Building''] in [http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20060614230448/http%3A//wwics.si.edu/subsites/ccpdc/pubs/words/frame.htm Words Over War] of Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict.\n* Alejandro Luis Corbacho: [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1016843 ''Predicting the Probability of War During Brinkmanship Crises: The Beagle and the Malvinas Conflicts''], Universidad del CEMA, Argentina,  Documento de Trabajo No. 244, September 2003, Spanish Language\n* Karin Oellers-Frahm: [http://www.zaoerv.de/39_1979/39_1979_2_b_341_354.pdf ''Der Schiedsspruch in der Beagle-Kanal-Streitigkeit''], Berichte und Urkunden: Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr ausl\u00e4ndisches \u00f6ffentliches Recht und V\u00f6lkerrecht, German Language\n* Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Chile: ''Relaciones Chileno-Argentinas, La controversia del Beagle''.
