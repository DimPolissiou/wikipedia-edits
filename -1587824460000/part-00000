After dinner at an Italian restaurant, they take a taxi back to Susan's flat, where both admit their loneliness. Susan takes Hugh's virginity.\n*'''Mary and Barry''' ([[Helen Christie]] and Richard Wren): Mary is a wealthy widow whose outward pride conceals her inner loneliness. She takes a young [[male escort]], Barry, to a nightclub and then back to her hotel room. Barry is put off by Mary's overbearing nature and slips away while her back is turned, leaving her heartbroken.\n*'''Emma and Wayne''' (Marijke Mann and Gil Barber): Emma is a company director weary of the business world. As an amusement, she hires a male escort, Wayne, to accompany her to a high-level Christmas party. Returning to Emma's house, Emma and Wayne have sex.\n*'''Harvey and Sheila''' ([[Brian Jackson (actor)|Brian Jackson]] and Barbara Wise): Harvey Matelow is a corrupt businessman who books an escort, Sheila, to take with him to a casino. Later, he tricks his way into her flat and rapes her. He is interrupted by Sheila's boyfriend (Max Mason), who photographs him in the act and proceeds to blackmail him, stealing his money and threatening to publish the photographs if he goes to the police. Realising that he has been set up, the humiliated Harvey is kicked out of the flat. Left alone, Sheila and the boyfriend have sex.\n*'''Vicky and Lester''' ([[Veronica Doran]] and Ken Gajadhar): To impress her old school friends, Vicky shows up at a reunion accompanied by Lester, a black male escort who has agreed to pose as her fianc\u00e9. Over the course of the party, Vicky's female friends fantasise about Lester and discreetly pass him their telephone numbers. Back at Vicky's flat, Lester hesitantly indulges Vicky's interracial [[rape fantasy]].\n*'''James and Ian''' ([[David Brierly]] and James Hunter): James and Ian are Scotsmen visiting London for the first time. They pick up two women and take them to dinner at a restaurant, where they are shocked to see an exotic dancer (Teresa Van Ross) give an explicit solo [[sex show]]. Later, they pursue the two women for sex but are knocked to the ground and drunkenly pass out.\n\nIn the film's epilogue, the normally shy and reserved Hugh arrives at work and greets his female colleagues by cheerfully slapping one of them on the rear with his morning newspaper.\n\n==Critical response==\n[[Gavin Millar]] of ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'' gave the film one star out of four.

The western species shares the same [[Nest|nesting biology]] as its fellow species, the eastern cicada killer (''[[Sphecius speciosus|S. speciosus]]''). ''S.&nbsp;grandis'', like all other species of the [[genus]] ''Sphecius'', mainly provides [[cicada]]s for its offspring. It forms nest aggregations and mates and [[Voltinism|broods once in a year]], in July and early August. The wasp is on average {{convert|3|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} to {{convert|5|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} in length and is amber-yellow with yellow rings on its [[abdomen]].\n\nWasps in the genus ''Sphecius'' are not habitually aggressive and use their [[venom]] mainly to paralyse cicadas which they take back to their nests to feed their young. The females catch around four or more cicadas for provisioning, place them in brood cells and lay eggs in the cells. ''S.&nbsp;grandis'' is [[Endemism|endemic]] to [[Central America]], Mexico and the [[Western United States]], and is found at a higher mean altitude than other species of ''Sphecius''. The western cicada killer males emerge earlier than females, but generally die after only a couple of days.\n\n''Sphecius grandis'' can be distinguished from ''S.&nbsp;convallis'' (the Pacific cicada killer wasp) by the coloration pattern of the gastral [[Tergum|tergites]]. Formerly, the two species were distinguished on the basis of the number of tergites with yellow markings (five in ''S.&nbsp;grandis'' and three in ''S.&nbsp;convallis''), but a more recent study showed that this character was insufficient to distinguish the two species. However, they can be distinguished by the density of the punctation on the first and second tergites.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe western cicada killer was first described by American naturalist [[Thomas Say]] in 1824 in [[Madera Canyon (Arizona)|Madera Canyon]], Arizona, as ''Stizus grandis''. Its species name is the [[Latin]] adjective ''grandis'' meaning \"large\". It is one of five species of the genus ''[[Sphecius]]'' in North America.<ref name=\"bionica\">{{cite journal | url=http://www.bio-nica.info/biblioteca/Holliday2006Sphecius.pdf | title=Improved Key to New World Species of Sphecius (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae |author1=Holliday, Charles W. |author2=Coelho, Joseph R. | journal=Annals of the Entomological Society of America | year=2006 | volume=99 | pages=793\u2013798 | doi=10.1603/0013-8746(2006)99[793:IKTNWS]2.0.CO;2 | issue=5}}</ref>\n\nMore recently, it has been suspected that the western cicada killer represents more than one species. It co-occurs with the eastern cicada killer (''S.&nbsp;speciosus'') and Pacific cicada killer (''S.&nbsp;convallis'') at [[Big Bend National Park]] in Texas. There the three wasps hunt and nest in the same locales, and the eastern and western cicada killers hunt the same cicada species. Analysis of [[mitochondrial DNA]] showed that the western cicada killer contains two divergent [[clade]]s, which may represent distinct species.

The female ''S.&nbsp;convallis'' was originally distinguished from the female ''S. grandis'' by the yellow marks from the first to third gastral [[Tergum|tergites]] on ''S.&nbsp;convallis'' and yellow marks on all tergites for ''S.&nbsp;grandis''. However, this was found to be insufficient for correct identification because the positions of the markings can vary among different wasps of the same species.<ref name=\"bionica\" />\n\nCharles W. Holliday and Joseph R. Coelho devised a new key in 2004 to identify the ''Sphecius'' species, examining 4,451 wasps among the five New World species, and noting that 98% of the female ''S. convallis'' wasps examined had yellow markings on gastral tergites one to four (or fewer) and ''S.&nbsp;grandis'' had 98% yellow markings from tergites one to five (or more). The 2% percent of ''S.&nbsp;grandis'' that overlapped with ''S.&nbsp;convallis'' were determined by density of the punctation in colour of the first tergum against the second. The markings on ''S.&nbsp;grandis'' males were found to be the same as on females.<ref name=\"bionica\" />\n\n===Thermoregulation===\nIt has been found that the western cicada killer wasp is capable of [[thermoregulation]] which enables them to maintain territories during the day.<ref name=\"sasi\" /> A study by Joseph R.

The western species shares the same [[Nest|nesting biology]] as its fellow species, the eastern cicada killer (''[[Sphecius speciosus|S. speciosus]]''). ''S.&nbsp;grandis'', like all other species of the [[genus]] ''Sphecius'', mainly provides [[cicada]]s for its offspring. It forms nest aggregations and mates and [[Voltinism|broods once in a year]], in July and early August. The wasp is on average {{convert|3|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} to {{convert|5|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} in length and is amber-yellow with yellow rings on its [[abdomen]].\n\nWasps in the genus ''Sphecius'' are not habitually aggressive and use their [[venom]] mainly to paralyse cicadas which they take back to their nests to feed their young. The females catch around four or more cicadas for provisioning, place them in brood cells and lay eggs in the cells. ''S.&nbsp;grandis'' is [[Endemism|endemic]] to [[Central America]], Mexico and the [[Western United States]], and is found at a higher mean altitude than other species of ''Sphecius''. The western cicada killer males emerge earlier than females, but generally die after only a couple of days.\n\n''Sphecius grandis'' can be distinguished from ''S.&nbsp;convallis'' (the Pacific cicada killer wasp) by the coloration pattern of the gastral [[Tergum|tergites]]. Formerly, the two species were distinguished on the basis of the number of tergites with yellow markings (five in ''S.&nbsp;grandis'' and three in ''S.&nbsp;convallis''), but a more recent study showed that this character was insufficient to distinguish the two species. However, they can be distinguished by the density of the punctation on the first and second tergites.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe western cicada killer was first described by American naturalist [[Thomas Say]] in 1824 in [[Madera Canyon]], Arizona, as ''Stizus grandis''. Its species name is the [[Latin]] adjective ''grandis'' meaning \"large\". It is one of five species of the genus ''[[Sphecius]]'' in North America.<ref name=\"bionica\">{{cite journal | url=http://www.bio-nica.info/biblioteca/Holliday2006Sphecius.pdf | title=Improved Key to New World Species of Sphecius (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae |author1=Holliday, Charles W. |author2=Coelho, Joseph R. | journal=Annals of the Entomological Society of America | year=2006 | volume=99 | pages=793\u2013798 | doi=10.1603/0013-8746(2006)99[793:IKTNWS]2.0.CO;2 | issue=5}}</ref>\n\nMore recently, it has been suspected that the western cicada killer represents more than one species. It co-occurs with the eastern cicada killer (''S.&nbsp;speciosus'') and Pacific cicada killer (''S.&nbsp;convallis'') at [[Big Bend National Park]] in Texas. There the three wasps hunt and nest in the same locales, and the eastern and western cicada killers hunt the same cicada species. Analysis of [[mitochondrial DNA]] showed that the western cicada killer contains two divergent [[clade]]s, which may represent distinct species. The two clades appeared to be split by the [[Rocky Mountains]], with one occurring mainly to the south and east, the other to the west.<ref name=\"zoot\">{{cite journal|author1=Hastings, Jon M. |author2=Schultheis, Patrick J. |author3=Whitson, Maggie |author4=Holliday, Charles W. |author5=Coelho, Joseph R. |author6=Mendell, Angela M. |year=2008|title=DNA barcoding of new world cicada killers (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae)|journal=[[Zootaxa]]|volume=1713|pages=27\u201338|url=http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2008/f/zt01713p038.pdf|hdl=10385/598}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nRanging in size from {{convert|3|to|5|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} in length, the western cicada killer is very similar to its eastern cousin, ''[[Sphecius speciosus]]'', with a [[rufous]] black hue to the body, amber stripes and a yellow abdomen.<ref name=\"bionica\" /><ref>{{cite journal| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RsVLAAAAYAAJ&q=sphecius+grandis&dq=sphecius+grandis | title=Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia | journal=American Natural History | year=1901 | volume=53 | pages=788\u2013794 | author1=Philadelphia | first1=Academy of Natural Sciences of}}</ref><ref name=\"cdri\">{{cite web | url=http://www.cdri.org/fieldguides/wasps/taxonomy/robust-yellow-group.html | title=Wasps (Order: Hymenoptera) \u2013 Robust Yellow Group | publisher=[[Chihuahuan Desert Nature Center and Botanical Gardens]] | access-date=August 11, 2011 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927062046/http://www.cdri.org/fieldguides/wasps/taxonomy/robust-yellow-group.html | archive-date=September 27, 2011 | df= }}</ref> The western cicada killer has rufous spots on its first to second tergites and yellow markings can generally be found from first to fifth, although there is some variation.<ref name=\"bionica\" /> On average, female [[forewing]] length lies between {{convert|2.5|and|3|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"jstor\" /> Females are larger than males and live for a year, a time just long enough to produce a brood, whereas the males die in only a few days, just enough time to impregnate a female.<ref name=\"cdri\" /> In Steven J.

The female ''S.&nbsp;convallis'' was originally distinguished from the female ''S. grandis'' by the yellow marks from the first to third gastral [[Tergum|tergites]] on ''S.&nbsp;convallis'' and yellow marks on all tergites for ''S.&nbsp;grandis''. However, this was found to be insufficient for correct identification because the positions of the markings can vary among different wasps of the same species.<ref name=\"bionica\" />\n\nCharles W. Holliday and Joseph R. Coelho devised a new key in 2004 to identify the ''Sphecius'' species, examining 4,451 wasps among the five New World species, and noting that 98% of the female ''S. convallis'' wasps examined had yellow markings on gastral tergites one to four (or fewer) and ''S.&nbsp;grandis'' had 98% yellow markings from tergites one to five (or more). The 2% percent of ''S.&nbsp;grandis'' that overlapped with ''S.&nbsp;convallis'' were determined by density of the punctation in colour of the first tergum against the second.

English naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] postulated that the pattern of male emergence before females evolved by [[natural selection]] to improve the chances of the male mating.

Various approaches have been reported for correlative imaging approaches using HT.\n\n=== Lipid quantification ===\nIntracellular lipid droplets play important roles in energy storage and metabolism, and are also related to various pathologies, including cancer, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. HT enables label-free and quantitative imaging and analysis for free or intracellular lipid droplets. Because lipid droplets have distinctly high RI (''n'' > 1.375) compared to other parts of cytoplasm, the measurements of RI tomograms provide information about the volume, concentration, and dry mass of lipid droplets.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Three-dimensional label-free imaging and quantification of lipid droplets in live hepatocytes|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=6|pages=36815|doi=10.1038/srep36815|year=2016|last1=Kim|first1=Kyoohyun|last2=Lee|first2=Seoeun|last3=Yoon|first3=Jonghee|last4=Heo|first4=Jihan|last5=Choi|first5=Chulhee|last6=Park|first6=Yongkeun|bibcode=2016NatSR...636815K|arxiv=1611.01774}}</ref> Recently, HT was used to evaluate the therapeutic effects of a nanodrug designed to affect the targeted delivery of lobeglitazone by measuring lipid droplets in foam cells.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Label-Free Tomographic Imaging of Lipid Droplets in Foam Cells for Machine-Learning-Assisted Therapeutic Evaluation of Targeted Nanodrugs|journal=ACS Nano|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1021/acsnano.9b07993|pmid=31909985|year=2020|last1=Park|first1=Sangwoo|last2=Ahn|first2=Jae Won|last3=Jo|first3=Youngju|last4=Kang|first4=Ha-Young|last5=Kim|first5=Hyun Jung|last6=Cheon|first6=Yeongmi|last7=Kim|first7=Jin Won|last8=Park|first8=Yongkeun|last9=Lee|first9=Seongsoo|last10=Park|first10=Kyeongsoon}}</ref>\n\n=== Experimental Laboratory ===\nHT provide various quantitative imaging capability, providing morphological, biochemical, and mechanical properties of individuals cells. 3D RI tomography directly provides morphological properties including volume, surface area, and [[sphericity]] (roundness) of a cell.
