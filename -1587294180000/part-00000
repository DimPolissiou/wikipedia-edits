It was disestablished in 1996 after the [[Eritrean War of Independence|independence of Eritrea]] in 1991 left [[Ethiopia]] landlocked.\nMany of the informations written are not correct.\n\n==The Imperial Ethiopian Navy==\n===Founding of the navy===\nEthiopia acquired a coastline and ports on the [[Red Sea]] in 1950 when the [[United Nations]] decided to federate Eritrea with Ethiopia. In 1955, the Imperial Ethiopian Navy was founded,<ref name=conways1947-1982p304>Gray, Randal, ed., ''Conway\u2032s All the World\u2032s Fighting Ships 1947\u20131982, Part II: The Warsaw Pact and Non-Aligned Nations'', Annapolis, Maryland: Naval Institute Press, 1983, {{ISBN|0-87021-919-7}}, p. 304.</ref> and its first (and primary) base \u2014 the [[Haile Selassie I Naval Base]] \u2014 was established at [[Massawa]] in 1956. The navy took delivery of its first ship in 1957.<ref name=conways1947-1982p304/> By the early 1960s workshops and other facilities were under construction at Massawa to give it complete naval base capabilities.\n\n===Organization===\nIn 1958, the navy became a fully independent service, organized as one of the three Ethiopian armed services &ndash; alongside the [[Ethiopian Army]] and [[Ethiopian Air Force]] &ndash; under the overall command of the Chief of Staff of the Imperial Armed Forces. The navy's deputy commander had his naval headquarters in [[Addis Ababa]]. The navy was conceived and built as a coastal navy for patrolling the Red Sea coast.\n\n===Training and education===\nThe Imperial Ethiopian Navy's personnel were among the best trained in the world.<ref name=\"harpoon\">[http://www.harpoondatabases.com/encyclopedia/Entry2367.aspx Harpoon Headquarters: Ethiopian Naval Forces]</ref> Even before Ethiopia took control of Eritrea, the British [[Royal Navy]] had seconded Ethiopian personnel to its bases in Eritrea to provide them with naval training. A naval college, where Ethiopian naval officers undertook a 52-month program of study, was founded at [[Asmara]] in 1956; each class admitted averaged 30 to 40 students in size, and they graduated with a naval [[Commissioned officer|commission]] and a [[bachelor of science]] degree.<ref name=\"harpoon\"/> In 1957, a Naval [[Non-Commissioned Officer]] School was established at Massawa as well. A [[Frogman]]/[[Underwater diving|Diving]] School for the training of a special [[commando]] unit and a Ratings' Training Establishment for the training of naval [[enlisted man|enlisted men]] also were established at Massawa by the late 1950s or early 1960s. Centers to provide enlisted men with training in technical specialities were established at [[Aseb]], Asmara, and Massawa.<ref name=\"harpoon\"/>\n\n[[Emperor]] [[Haile Selassie I]] appointed 25 [[Royal Norwegian Navy]] [[Commissioned officer|officers]] to help in organizing  Ethiopia's new navy, and they oversaw much of the training. Retired British Royal Navy officers also served as trainers and advisers during Haile Selassie's reign.

Although ''Ethiopia'' continued in her role as a training ship and remained Ethiopia's largest naval vessel, the United States ceased arms sales to Ethiopia in 1977, and Soviet-built patrol boats and [[missile boat]]s began to replace other ships.

In April 1977, the navy lost the Cape-class patrol boat ''P-11'', with reports blaming the loss both on a storm and on an attack by the [[Eritrean People's Liberation Front]] (EPLF).

The Eritrean rebellion spread to the Dahlak Islands, where the EPLF damaged the [[Petya-class frigate|Petya II-class]] frigate ''F-1616'' beyond repair.

By the spring of 1991, the navy{{'}}s ships had begun to use ports in [[Djibouti]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and [[Yemen]] because of the danger of returning to their home bases. In late May 1991, the EPLF captured Asmara and surrounded Assab, where fire from its ground forces sank seven Ethiopian Navy ships in port. On 25 May 1991, the 14  Ethiopian Navy ships capable of putting to sea fled Assab, ten of them steaming to Yemen and the others to Saudi Arabia, leaving behind seven ships and a variety of small craft.

The Ethiopian Navy remained in existence, left in the curious and unusual position of having no home ports. Nonetheless, directed by its headquarters in Addis Ababa, it continued occasional patrols in the Red Sea from ports in Yemen. In 1993, Yemen finally expelled the Ethiopian ships; by then some had deteriorated too much to be seaworthy, and the Ethiopians left them behind in Yemen.

For a time it was thought that the Ethiopian Navy might survive, based at Assab in Eritrea or at Djibouti, and Ethiopia even requested that Eritrea lease it pier space at Assab from which to operate the surviving Ethiopian Navy. Eritrea refused the request.

Eritrea expressed interest in 16 of them, but finally limited itself to purchasing only four of them &ndash; an [[Osa-class missile boat|Osa-II class]] [[missile boat]] and three [[Swiftships Shipbuilders]] patrol craft &ndash; in order to avoid exacerbating an international crisis with Yemen.

It comprises [[Monterey County, California|Monterey]], [[San Benito County, California|San Benito]], [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo]], and [[Santa Cruz County, California|Santa Cruz]] counties.\n\nThe diocese is led by an [[Ordinary (Catholic Church)|ordinary]] [[bishop]]; the bishop's [[cathedra]] is located at the [[Cathedral of San Carlos Borromeo]], the [[mother church]] of the diocese, in [[Monterey, California]]. The diocese serves close to 200,000 Catholics in 46 parishes and 18 schools.\n\n==History==\nThe history of the Catholic Church in Monterey began with the establishment on the shores of [[Monterey Bay]] of [[Mission San Carlos Borromeo]] in 1770 by Saint [[Jun\u00edpero Serra]], [[Order of Friars Minor|OFM]]. Father Serra moved the mission to [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel]] the next year, which served as the headquarters of the chain of [[Spanish missions in California]].\n\nWith the [[papal bull]] ''Apostolicam sollicitudinem'' of 27 April 1840, Pope [[Gregory XVI]] set up a new [[episcopal see]], to which he gave the name of '''[[California (titular see)|Diocese of California]]'''. He assigned to it a vast territory taken from that of the [[Diocese of Sonora]], now the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hermosillo|Archdiocese of Hermosillo]] in Mexico. It included [[Alta California]] (corresponding to the present-day states of [[California]], [[Nevada]], [[Arizona]], [[Utah]], western [[Colorado]] and southwestern [[Wyoming]]) and the [[Baja California Territory]] (the modern Mexican states of [[Baja California (state)|Baja California]] and [[Baja California Sur]]). He set the episcopal residence at [[San Diego]] and made the diocese a [[suffragan]] of the [[Archdiocese of Mexico City]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/iurispontificii01martgoog#page/n6/mode/1up The Papal Bull ''Apostolicam sollicitudinem''], in Raffaele de Martinis, ''Iuris pontificii de propaganda fide. Pars prima'', Tomus V, Romae 1890, pp. 233\u2013235]</ref>\n\nThe first bishop of the diocese was [[Francisco Garcia Diego y Moreno]], [[Order of Friars Minor|OFM]]. [[Mission Santa Barbara]] served as the [[pro-cathedral]].\n\nIn 1848 Alta California was ceded to the [[United States]] after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], and the government of [[Mexico]] objected to a United States-based bishop having jurisdiction over parishes in Mexican Baja California. The [[Holy See]] divided the diocese into American and Mexican sections and, on 20 November 1849, with the episcopal residence moved to Monterey, a more central position for the new diocese, the American section became the Diocese of Monterey. The [[Royal Presidio Chapel]] in Monterey served as the pro-cathedral of the American diocese. In 1853 the diocese was split again, when [[Pope Pius IX]] created the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco|Archdiocese of San Francisco]], and Monterey was transferred to be a suffragan of the new [[archdiocese]].\n\nIn 1859, the diocese's name was changed to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Monterey-Los Angeles|Diocese of Monterey-Los Angeles]], due to the growth of the [[Los Angeles, California|City of Los Angeles]]. The diocese was split in 1922 to form the Dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Monterey-Fresno|Monterey-Fresno]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Los Angeles-San Diego|Los Angeles-San Diego]]. In 1936 the diocese again changed [[metropolitan bishop]]s, becoming a suffragan of the newly erected [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles|Archdiocese of Los Angeles]]. The latest territorial change for the diocese came in 1967, when it was split again, to form the present dioceses of Monterey and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Fresno|Fresno]]. The diocese remains as a suffragen diocese of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles.\n\n==Bishops==\nThe lists of Bishops and their years of service:\n\n===Bishop of the Two Californias===\n#[[Francisco Garcia Diego y Moreno]], [[Order of Friars Minor|OFM]] (1840\u20131846)\n(Father [[Jos\u00e9 Maria Gonz\u00e1lez R\u00fabio]], O.F.M. was administrator, 1846-1849.)\n\n===Bishop of Monterey===\n# [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], [[Dominican Order|OP]] (1850\u20131853), appointed [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]\n# [[Thaddeus Amat y Brusi]], [[Congregation of the Mission|CM]] (1853\u20131859)\n\n===Bishop of Monterey-Los Angeles===\n# Thaddeus Amat y Brusi,  CM (1859\u20131878)\n# [[Francisco Mora y Borrell]] (1878\u20131896), created [[Archbishop]] (ad personam) upon retirement in 1896\n# [[George Thomas Montgomery]] (1896\u20131902), appointed [[Archdiocese of San Francisco|Coadjutor Archbishop of San Francisco]]\n# [[Thomas James Conaty]] (1903\u20131915)\n# [[John Joseph Cantwell]] (1917\u20131922), appointed [[Archbishop of Los Angeles]]\n([[Peter Muldoon|Peter J.

It comprises [[Monterey County, California|Monterey]], [[San Benito County, California|San Benito]], [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo]], and [[Santa Cruz County, California|Santa Cruz]] counties.\n\nThe diocese is led by an [[Ordinary (Catholic Church)|ordinary]] [[bishop]]; the bishop's [[cathedra]] is located at the [[Cathedral of San Carlos Borromeo]], the [[mother church]] of the diocese, in [[Monterey, California]]. The diocese serves close to 200,000 Catholics in 46 parishes and 18 schools.\n\n==History==\nThe history of the Catholic Church in Monterey began with the establishment on the shores of [[Monterey Bay]] of [[Mission San Carlos Borromeo]] in 1770 by Saint [[Jun\u00edpero Serra]], [[Order of Friars Minor|OFM]]. Father Serra moved the mission to [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel]] the next year, which served as the headquarters of the chain of [[Spanish missions in California]].\n\nWith the [[papal bull]] ''Apostolicam sollicitudinem'' of 27 April 1840, Pope [[Gregory XVI]] set up a new [[episcopal see]], to which he gave the name of '''[[California (titular see)|Diocese of California]]'''. He assigned to it a vast territory taken from that of the [[Diocese of Sonora]], now the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hermosillo|Archdiocese of Hermosillo]] in Mexico. It included [[Alta California]] (corresponding to the present-day states of [[California]], [[Nevada]], [[Arizona]], [[Utah]], western [[Colorado]] and southwestern [[Wyoming]]) and the [[Baja California Territory]] (the modern Mexican states of [[Baja California (state)|Baja California]] and [[Baja California Sur]]). He set the episcopal residence at [[San Diego]] and made the diocese a [[suffragan]] of the [[Archdiocese of Mexico City]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/iurispontificii01martgoog#page/n6/mode/1up The Papal Bull ''Apostolicam sollicitudinem''], in Raffaele de Martinis, ''Iuris pontificii de propaganda fide. Pars prima'', Tomus V, Romae 1890, pp. 233\u2013235]</ref>\n\nThe first bishop of the diocese was [[Francisco Garcia Diego y Moreno]], [[Order of Friars Minor|OFM]]. [[Mission Santa Barbara]] served as the [[pro-cathedral]].\n\nIn 1848 Alta California was ceded to the [[United States]] after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], and the government of [[Mexico]] objected to a United States-based bishop having jurisdiction over parishes in Mexican Baja California. The [[Holy See]] divided the diocese into American and Mexican sections and, on 20 November 1849, with the episcopal residence moved to Monterey, a more central position for the new diocese, the American section became the Diocese of Monterey. The [[Royal Presidio Chapel]] in Monterey served as the pro-cathedral of the American diocese. In 1853 the diocese was split again, when [[Pope Pius IX]] created the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco|Archdiocese of San Francisco]], and Monterey was transferred to be a suffragan of the new [[archdiocese]].\n\nIn 1859, the diocese's name was changed to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Monterey-Los Angeles|Diocese of Monterey-Los Angeles]], due to the growth of the [[Los Angeles, California|City of Los Angeles]]. The diocese was split in 1922 to form the Dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Monterey-Fresno|Monterey-Fresno]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Los Angeles-San Diego|Los Angeles-San Diego]]. In 1936 the diocese again changed [[metropolitan bishop]]s, becoming a suffragan of the newly erected [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles|Archdiocese of Los Angeles]]. The latest territorial change for the diocese came in 1967, when it was split again, to form the present dioceses of Monterey and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Fresno|Fresno]]. The diocese remains as a suffragen diocese of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles.\n\n==Bishops==\nThe lists of Bishops and their years of service:\n\n===Bishop of the Two Californias===\n#[[Francisco Garcia Diego y Moreno]], [[Order of Friars Minor|OFM]] (1840\u20131846)\n(Father [[Jos\u00e9 Maria Gonz\u00e1lez R\u00fabio]], O.F.M. was administrator, 1846-1849.)\n\n===Bishop of Monterey===\n# [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], [[Dominican Order|OP]] (1850\u20131853), appointed [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]\n# [[Thaddeus Amat y Brusi]], [[Congregation of the Mission|CM]] (1853\u20131859)\n\n===Bishop of Monterey-Los Angeles===\n# Thaddeus Amat y Brusi,  CM (1859\u20131878)\n# [[Francisco Mora y Borrell]] (1878\u20131896), created [[Archbishop]] (ad personam) upon retirement in 1896\n# [[George Thomas Montgomery]] (1896\u20131902), appointed [[Archdiocese of San Francisco|Coadjutor Archbishop of San Francisco]]\n# [[Thomas James Conaty]] (1903\u20131915)\n# [[John Joseph Cantwell]] (1917\u20131922), appointed [[Archbishop of Los Angeles]]\n([[Peter Muldoon|Peter J.
