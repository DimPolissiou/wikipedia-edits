After the [[Fourth Crusade]], members of the family fled to the neighboring [[Empire of Nicaea]], ruled by the [[Laskaris]] family, where [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] became senior co-emperor to the young [[John IV Laskaris]] in 1259.

One branch of the family, descended from Emperor [[Andronikos II Palaiologos|Andronikos II]], had ruled the [[Duchy of Montferrat]] in Italy as feudal lords since 1306 and continued to do so until its extinction in 1536. Some Palaiologoi attained prominent positions within Ottoman society in the decades following Constantinople's fall. The surviving brothers of the final emperor Constantine XI; [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrios]] and [[Thomas Palaiologos]], quarreled over who was the rightful heir to the empire, their last certain descendants with the Palaiologos name died in the 16th century, although one branch with alleged, but uncertain, descent from Thomas survived until the 17th century in Barbados and England.\n\nNot all who bore the name Palaiologos were closely related to the imperial line, even in Byzantine times, and in the centuries following Constantinople's fall, many Palaiologoi spread out across Europe, mainly settling in Italy or choosing to remain in the Ottoman Empire.

[[Alexios Palaiologos (Despot)|Alexios Palaiologos]] (died 1203) married a granddaughter of Zoe Doukaina (youngest daughter of [[Constantine X Doukas]]) and her husband [[Adrianos Komnenos]] (younger brother of Emperor Alexios I).

The couple were the progenitors of the imperial dynasty. Their son was Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] (1223\u20131282).\n\nThe fact that the Palaiologoi were descended from most of the major Byzantine dynasties was reflected in their choice of presenting their names.

The word \"[[Hellene]]\" began to be used more frequently than before to describe themselves, after having been seen as a synonym for \"[[pagan]]\" for many centuries. The dynasty was a patron of literature and the arts; among others, [[George Gemistos Plethon]] came to prominence. The [[hesychasm]] controversy also took place during the rule of the Palaiologoi dynasty.\n\nAt the later days of their empire the [[Peloponnese]] was the largest and wealthiest part of the empire, and was ruled as the [[Despotate of Morea]] by members of the Palaiologos family, often two or three younger brothers simultaneously. Although they often squabbled amongst themselves they were usually fiercely loyal to the emperor in Constantinople (though sometimes they sought to supplant the emperor and rise to the throne), while their land was surrounded by hostile [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]]. The capital of the despotate was [[Mystras]], a large fortress built by the Palaiologoi near [[Sparta]].\n\nThe Palaiologoi twice attempted to reunite the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] with the [[Roman Catholic Church]], hoping this would lead the West to give them aid against the Turks. The first attempt was at the [[Second Council of Lyons]] in 1274 under [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] and the second in 1438-39 under [[John VIII Palaiologos]] at the [[Council of Ferrara-Florence]]. Every attempt at reunification was strongly opposed by the regular clergy and the general population.\n[[File:Manuel II Paleologus.jpg|thumb|Emperor [[Manuel II Palaiologos]] (r. 1391\u20131425)]]\nAfter having been reduced in size due to outside invasion and internal civil war, the Byzantine Empire of the 15th century had shrunk to the cities of Constantinople, [[Thessaloniki|Thessalonica]] and [[Despotate of the Morea|the Morea]].

The family Palaiologos had already been quite widespread during the late Byzantine Empire and not all who bore the name were closely related to the imperial line. Acting as a penniless refugee from Byzantium, the name Palaiologos could lend whoever bore it prestige, if not monetary support from a prince, a pope or a cardinal. Many such Palaiologoi settled in Venice and other parts of Italy.<ref name=\":02\"/>\n\nSeveral such Palaiologoi served as [[cavalrymen]] in the service of the [[Republic of Venice]]. Among well-documented Palaiologoi were a Teodoro Paleologo, likely originally from [[Mystras]], who died in 1532,<ref>''[https://condottieridiventura.it/teodoro-paleologo-greco/ Teodoro Paleologo greco].'' Accessed on 5 May 2019(Italian).</ref> a Giovanni around 1482, Annibale Paleologus and his son Laeziniano around 1586, a Lucio Andronico Paleologo at the beginning of the 16th century and an Andrea Paleologo Graitzas around 1460. A large number of people with the last name Palaiologos (or variations thereof) living in Athens today still claim descent from this Andrea Paleologo Graitzas.<ref name=\":02\"/>\n\nThe use of titles and claims, even fake ones, by people from the Balkans also served as a way to remind the Western Europeans of the suffering that the people of the east had endured, thus becoming a means to earn sympathy and trust. Furthermore, if you were of noble birth it was likelier that you would be treated well. There was a \"Michael Palaiologos\" in Rome in 1505, who managed to convince Pope Julius II to send letters to the kings of Western Europe in the hope of raising ransom money so that Michael could pay the Ottomans for the release of his wife and children. Michael claimed to be related (in various ways) to the \"Duke of Constantinople\". Even though \"Palaiologos\" might have been his real last name, he was likely not closely related to the imperial line. Although successful in convincing the Pope and travelling northern Europe with Latin translations of the Pope's letter, he had little success in raising further sympathy. When he reached [[Turnhout]] in [[Flanders]], Michael was accused of being an impostor and promptly imprisoned, after which nothing more is known of his fate.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe Palaiologos dynasty had a lasting impact on the Greeks through the centuries of Ottoman rule, having been the last to govern independent Greek lands. The [[First Hellenic Republic|provisional government]] of the newly liberated Greece in the 19th century sent a delegation to Britain in search for living members or descendants of the Palaiologoi that could be offered the Greek throne and though the grave of Theodore Palaiologos in Landulph, Cornwall was noted, the delegation failed to find any living descendants.<ref name=\":12\"/> The noble who eventually was selected as the first King of Greece was [[Otto of Greece|Otto of Bavaria]] who through his ancestor [[John II, Duke of Bavaria]], was a descendant of the Laskaris dynasty (John being a great-great-great-grandson of Theodore I Laskaris through his daughter Maria Laskarina), the dynasty which the Palaiologoi had overthrown 571 years prior.\n\n== Family tree of the Palaiologoi (11th\u201316th century) ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | | | | Nik |Nik=[[Nikephoros Palaiologos|Nikephoros]]<br>duke of [[Mesopotamia (theme)|Mesopotamia]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |!|}}\n{{familytree | | | | | Geo |Geo=[[George Palaiologos|Georgios]]<br>Palaiologos<br><small>\u221e Anna Doukaina<br>(grand-nephew of [[Constantine X Doukas]])}}\n{{familytree | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|.}}\n{{familytree | Ale | | Nik | | And |Nik=Nikephoros|Ale=Alexios<br><small>\u221e Anna Komnene Doukaina|And=[[Andronikos Doukas Palaiologos|Andronikos]]<br>duke of Thessalonica<br><small>\u221e Komnene<br>(grand-daughter of [[Constantine X Doukas]])}}\n{{familytree | |!| | | |!}}\n{{familytree | Geo | | Mih |Mih=Michael|Geo=George<br>megas eteriarxes}}\n{{familytree | |!| | | |!}}\n{{familytree | Alx | | Ale |Alx=[[Alexios Palaiologos (despot)|Alexios]]<br>despot<br><small>~ Irene Angelina<br>(daughter [[Alexios III Angelos]])|Ale=Alexios<br>megas doux<br><small>\u221e Irene Komnene}}\n{{familytree | |!| | | |!}}\n{{familytree | The |~| And |~| unk |The=1.Teodora Palaiologina|And=[[Andronikos Palaiologos (megas domestikos)|Andronikos]]<br>megas domestikos|unk=2.(unknown)}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |)|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.|}}\n{{familytree | The |~| Mi8 | | Joh | | Con | | Mar | | Ire |Mi8=(1) [[Michael VIII Palaiologos|Michael VIII]]<br>Byzantine Emperor|The=Theodora Vatatzaina<br><small>(niece of [[John III Doukas Vatatzes|John III Vatatzes]])<br></small>[[Vatatzes|HOUSE OF VATATZES]]|Joh=(1) [[John Palaiologos (brother of Michael VIII)|John]]<br>megas domestikos<br><small>\u221e Tornikaina|Con=(2) [[Constantine Palaiologos (half-brother of Michael VIII)|Constantine]]<br><small>\u221e Irene Vranaina|Ire=Irene<br><small>\u221e John Kantakouzenos|Mar=Maria<br><small>\u221e Nikephoros Tarchaneiotes}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |)|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.}}\n{{familytree | | | | | An2 | | Ire | | Ann | | Eud | | The | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Con | | Tra |An2=[[Andronikos II Palaiologos|Andronikos II]]<br>Byzantine Emperor<br><small>\u221e 1.[[Anna of Hungary (1260-1281)|Anna of Hungary]]<br>2.[[Irene of Montferrat]]|Ire=[[Irene Palaiologina, Empress of Bulgaria|Irene]]<br><small>\u221e [[Ivan Asen III|Ivan III Asen-Mitso]]<br>tsar of Bulgaria|Ann=Anna<br><small>\u03c3\u03cd\u03b6.[[Demetrios Doukas Komnenos Koutroules|Demetrios (Michael) Angelos ''Koutroyles'']]<br>general|Eud=[[Eudokia Palaiologina]]<br><small>\u221e [[John II of Trebizond]]|The=Theodora<br><small>\u221e [[David VI of Georgia]]|Tra=[[Theodore Palaiologos (son of Michael VIII)|Theodore]]<br>general<br><small>\u221e (daughter of pinkernes [[Libadarios]])|Con=[[Constantine Palaiologos (son of Michael VIII)|Constantine]]<br>general<br><small>\u221e Irene Raoulaina}}\n{{familytree | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.| | | |!}}\n{{familytree | Ire | | Mi9 | | | | | | | | | | Cos | | Jon | | Sim | | Th1 | | Det | | Jhn |Ire=(illeg.)

After the [[Fourth Crusade]], members of the family fled to the neighboring [[Empire of Nicaea]], ruled by the [[Laskaris]] family, where [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] became senior co-emperor to the young [[John IV Laskaris]] in 1259.

One branch of the family, descended from Emperor [[Andronikos II Palaiologos|Andronikos II]], had ruled the [[Duchy of Montferrat]] in Italy as feudal lords since 1306 and continued to do so until its extinction in 1536. Some Palaiologoi attained prominent positions within Ottoman society in the decades following Constantinople's fall. The surviving brothers of the final emperor Constantine XI; [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrios]] and [[Thomas Palaiologos]], quarreled over who was the rightful heir to the empire, their last certain descendants with the Palaiologos name died in the 16th century, although one branch with alleged, but uncertain, descent from Thomas survived until the 17th century in Barbados and England.\n\nNot all who bore the name Palaiologos were closely related to the imperial line, even in Byzantine times, and in the centuries following Constantinople's fall, many Palaiologoi spread out across Europe, mainly settling in Italy or choosing to remain in the Ottoman Empire. The last name, and variations of it, remains in use in Greece and elsewhere, although connections between any living Palaiologoi and the old imperial dynasty cannot be confidently established.\n\n== Origins ==\nThe origins of the Palaiologoi (<small>{{abbr|lit.|Literally}}</small>&nbsp;\"old word\", sometimes glossed as \"ragman\"<ref>{{cite dictionary|last=Kazhdan|first=Alexander P.|author-link=Alexander P.

[[Alexios Palaiologos (Despot)|Alexios Palaiologos]] (died 1203) married a granddaughter of Zoe Doukaina (youngest daughter of [[Constantine X Doukas]]) and her husband [[Adrianos Komnenos]] (younger brother of Emperor Alexios I).

The couple were the progenitors of the imperial dynasty. Their son was Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] (1223\u20131282).\n\nThe fact that the Palaiologoi were descended from most of the major Byzantine dynasties was reflected in their choice of presenting their names.

The word \"[[Hellene]]\" began to be used more frequently than before to describe themselves, after having been seen as a synonym for \"[[pagan]]\" for many centuries. The dynasty was a patron of literature and the arts; among others, [[George Gemistos Plethon]] came to prominence. The [[hesychasm]] controversy also took place during the rule of the Palaiologoi dynasty.\n\nAt the later days of their empire the [[Peloponnese]] was the largest and wealthiest part of the empire, and was ruled as the [[Despotate of Morea]] by members of the Palaiologos family, often two or three younger brothers simultaneously. Although they often squabbled amongst themselves they were usually fiercely loyal to the emperor in Constantinople (though sometimes they sought to supplant the emperor and rise to the throne), while their land was surrounded by hostile [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]]. The capital of the despotate was [[Mystras]], a large fortress built by the Palaiologoi near [[Sparta]].\n\nThe Palaiologoi twice attempted to reunite the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] with the [[Roman Catholic Church]], hoping this would lead the West to give them aid against the Turks. The first attempt was at the [[Second Council of Lyons]] in 1274 under [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] and the second in 1438-39 under [[John VIII Palaiologos]] at the [[Council of Ferrara-Florence]]. Every attempt at reunification was strongly opposed by the regular clergy and the general population.\n[[File:Manuel II Paleologus.jpg|thumb|Emperor [[Manuel II Palaiologos]] (r. 1391\u20131425)]]\nAfter having been reduced in size due to outside invasion and internal civil war, the Byzantine Empire of the 15th century had shrunk to the cities of Constantinople, [[Thessaloniki|Thessalonica]] and [[Despotate of the Morea|the Morea]].

In the decades after 1453, Ottoman tax registers show a consortium of noble Greeks co-operating to bid for the lucrative [[tax farming]] district including Constantinople and the ports of western Anatolia. This group included names like \"Palologoz of Kassandros\" and \"Manuel Palologoz\".<ref name=\":6\">Papademetriou, Tom (2015).

The family Palaiologos had already been quite widespread during the late Byzantine Empire and not all who bore the name were closely related to the imperial line. Acting as a penniless refugee from Byzantium, the name Palaiologos could lend whoever bore it prestige, if not monetary support from a prince, a pope or a cardinal. Many such Palaiologoi settled in Venice and other parts of Italy.<ref name=\":02\"/>\n\nSeveral such Palaiologoi served as [[cavalrymen]] in the service of the [[Republic of Venice]]. Among well-documented Palaiologoi were a Teodoro Paleologo, likely originally from [[Mystras]], who died in 1532,<ref>''[https://condottieridiventura.it/teodoro-paleologo-greco/ Teodoro Paleologo greco].'' Accessed on 5 May 2019(Italian).</ref> a Giovanni around 1482, Annibale Paleologus and his son Laeziniano around 1586, a Lucio Andronico Paleologo at the beginning of the 16th century and an Andrea Paleologo Graitzas around 1460. A large number of people with the last name Palaiologos (or variations thereof) living in Athens today still claim descent from this Andrea Paleologo Graitzas.<ref name=\":02\"/>\n\nThe use of titles and claims, even fake ones, by people from the Balkans also served as a way to remind the Western Europeans of the suffering that the people of the east had endured, thus becoming a means to earn sympathy and trust. Furthermore, if you were of noble birth it was likelier that you would be treated well. There was a \"Michael Palaiologos\" in Rome in 1505, who managed to convince Pope Julius II to send letters to the kings of Western Europe in the hope of raising ransom money so that Michael could pay the Ottomans for the release of his wife and children. Michael claimed to be related (in various ways) to the \"Duke of Constantinople\". Even though \"Palaiologos\" might have been his real last name, he was likely not closely related to the imperial line. Although successful in convincing the Pope and travelling northern Europe with Latin translations of the Pope's letter, he had little success in raising further sympathy. When he reached [[Turnhout]] in [[Flanders]], Michael was accused of being an impostor and promptly imprisoned, after which nothing more is known of his fate.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe Palaiologos dynasty had a lasting impact on the Greeks though the centuries of Ottoman rule, having been the last to govern independent Greek lands. The [[First Hellenic Republic|provisional government]] of the newly liberated Greece in the 19th century sent a delegation to Britain in search for living members or descendants of the Palaiologoi that could be offered the Greek throne and though the grave of Theodore Palaiologos in Landulph, Cornwall was noted, the delegation failed to find any living descendants.<ref name=\":12\"/> The noble who eventually was selected as the first King of Greece was [[Otto of Greece|Otto of Bavaria]] who through his ancestor [[John II, Duke of Bavaria]], was a descendant of the Laskaris dynasty (John being a great-great-great-grandson of Theodore I Laskaris through his daughter Maria Laskarina), the dynasty which the Palaiologoi had overthrown 571 years prior.\n\n== Family tree of the Palaiologoi (11th\u201316th century) ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | | | | Nik |Nik=[[Nikephoros Palaiologos|Nikephoros]]<br>duke of [[Mesopotamia (theme)|Mesopotamia]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |!|}}\n{{familytree | | | | | Geo |Geo=[[George Palaiologos|Georgios]]<br>Palaiologos<br><small>\u221e Anna Doukaina<br>(grand-nephew of [[Constantine X Doukas]])}}\n{{familytree | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|.}}\n{{familytree | Ale | | Nik | | And |Nik=Nikephoros|Ale=Alexios<br><small>\u221e Anna Komnene Doukaina|And=[[Andronikos Doukas Palaiologos|Andronikos]]<br>duke of Thessalonica<br><small>\u221e Komnene<br>(grand-daughter of [[Constantine X Doukas]])}}\n{{familytree | |!| | | |!}}\n{{familytree | Geo | | Mih |Mih=Michael|Geo=George<br>megas eteriarxes}}\n{{familytree | |!| | | |!}}\n{{familytree | Alx | | Ale |Alx=[[Alexios Palaiologos (despot)|Alexios]]<br>despot<br><small>~ Irene Angelina<br>(daughter [[Alexios III Angelos]])|Ale=Alexios<br>megas doux<br><small>\u221e Irene Komnene}}\n{{familytree | |!| | | |!}}\n{{familytree | The |~| And |~| unk |The=1.Teodora Palaiologina|And=[[Andronikos Palaiologos (megas domestikos)|Andronikos]]<br>megas domestikos|unk=2.(unknown)}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |)|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.|}}\n{{familytree | The |~| Mi8 | | Joh | | Con | | Mar | | Ire |Mi8=(1) [[Michael VIII Palaiologos|Michael VIII]]<br>Byzantine Emperor|The=Theodora Vatatzaina<br><small>(niece of [[John III Doukas Vatatzes|John III Vatatzes]])<br></small>[[Vatatzes|HOUSE OF VATATZES]]|Joh=(1) [[John Palaiologos (brother of Michael VIII)|John]]<br>megas domestikos<br><small>\u221e Tornikaina|Con=(2) [[Constantine Palaiologos (half-brother of Michael VIII)|Constantine]]<br><small>\u221e Irene Vranaina|Ire=Irene<br><small>\u221e John Kantakouzenos|Mar=Maria<br><small>\u221e Nikephoros Tarchaneiotes}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |)|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.}}\n{{familytree | | | | | An2 | | Ire | | Ann | | Eud | | The | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Con | | Tra |An2=[[Andronikos II Palaiologos|Andronikos II]]<br>Byzantine Emperor<br><small>\u221e 1.[[Anna of Hungary (1260-1281)|Anna of Hungary]]<br>2.[[Irene of Montferrat]]|Ire=[[Irene Palaiologina, Empress of Bulgaria|Irene]]<br><small>\u221e [[Ivan Asen III|Ivan III Asen-Mitso]]<br>tsar of Bulgaria|Ann=Anna<br><small>\u03c3\u03cd\u03b6.[[Demetrios Doukas Komnenos Koutroules|Demetrios (Michael) Angelos ''Koutroyles'']]<br>general|Eud=[[Eudokia Palaiologina]]<br><small>\u221e [[John II of Trebizond]]|The=Theodora<br><small>\u221e [[David VI of Georgia]]|Tra=[[Theodore Palaiologos (son of Michael VIII)|Theodore]]<br>general<br><small>\u221e (daughter of pinkernes [[Libadarios]])|Con=[[Constantine Palaiologos (son of Michael VIII)|Constantine]]<br>general<br><small>\u221e Irene Raoulaina}}\n{{familytree | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.| | | |!}}\n{{familytree | Ire | | Mi9 | | | | | | | | | | Cos | | Jon | | Sim | | Th1 | | Det | | Jhn |Ire=(illeg.)

Beyond this, his name is mentioned by only two other ancient sources. once in the eighth-century poet St. Germanos and once in the [[Suda|Souda]] (s. v. ''anaklomenon'') where he is called \"Romanos the melodist\". From this scanty evidence we learn that he was born to a Jewish family in either [[Emesa]] (modern-day Homs) or [[Damascus]] in [[Syria]]. He was baptized as a young boy (though whether or not his parents also converted is uncertain). Having moved to [[Beirut|Berytus]] (Beirut), he was [[ordination|ordained]] a [[deacon]] in the Church of the Resurrection there.\n\nHe later moved to [[Constantinople]] during the reign of the emperor Anastasius\u2014on the question whether [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]] (491-518) or [[Anastasius II (emperor)|Anastasius II]] (713-716) is meant, the renowned Byzantinologist Prof. [[Karl Krumbacher]] favours the earlier date.<ref>Krumbacher, ''Gesch. d. byz. Literatur'', (Munich, 1897), pp. 312-18.</ref> There he served as [[sacristan]] in the \"Great Church\" ([[Hagia Sophia]]), residing to the end of his life at the Monastery of Kyros, where he was buried along with his disciple St. Ananias.\n\nIf those scholars who believe that he lived during the reign of the earlier Anastasius are correct, then he may have continued writing during the reign of Emperor [[Justinian]] (527-65), who was himself a hymn-writer; this would make him a contemporary of two other famous Byzantine hymnographers, Anastasios and [[Kyriakos]].\n\n==Legend==\nAccording to legend, Romanus was not at first considered to be either a talented [[reader (liturgy)|reader]] or singer. He was, however, loved by the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] because of his great humility. Once, around the year 518, while serving in the [[Church of St. Mary of Blachernae (Istanbul)|Church of the Panagia]] at [[Blachernae]], during the [[All-Night Vigil]] for the [[Christmas Day|Feast of the Nativity of Christ]], he was assigned to read the [[kathisma]] verses from the [[Psalter]]. He read so poorly that another reader had to take his place. Some of the lesser clergy ridiculed Romanus for this, and being humiliated he sat down in one of the [[Choir (architecture)|choir stalls]]. Overcome by weariness and sorrow, he soon fell asleep. As he slept, the [[Theotokos]] (Mother of God) appeared to him with a scroll in her hand. She commanded him to eat the scroll, and as soon as he did so, he awoke. He immediately received a blessing from the Patriarch, mounted the [[Pulpit|ambo]] (pulpit), and chanted extemporaneously his famous Kontakion of the Nativity, \"Today the Virgin gives birth to Him Who is above all being\u2026.\" The emperor, the patriarch, the clergy, and the entire congregation were amazed at both the profound theology of the hymn and Romanos' clear, sonorous voice as he sang. According to tradition, this was the very first kontakion ever sung. The Greek word \"kontakion\" ({{lang|grc|\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd}}) refers to the shaft on which a scroll is wound, hence the significance of the Theotokos' command for him to swallow a scroll, indicating that his compositions were by divine inspiration.

Arresting imagery, sharp metaphors and similes, bold comparisons, antitheses, coining of successful maxims, and vivid dramatization characterize his style.\n\nHe is said to have composed more than 1,000 [[hymn]]s or ''kontakia'' celebrating various festivals of the [[ecclesiastical year]], the lives of the [[saint]]s and other sacred subjects,<ref name=EB1911/> some 60 to 80 of which survive (though not all those attributed to him may be genuine).\n\nToday, usually only the first [[strophe]] of each kontakion is chanted during the [[canonical hours|divine services]], the full hymn having been replaced by the [[canon (hymnography)|canon]]. A full kontakion was a poetic [[sermon]] composed of from 18 to 30 verses or ''[[Oikos|ikoi]]'', each with a refrain, and united by an [[acrostic]].  When it was sung to an original melody, it was called an ''[[idiomelon]]''.  Originally, Saint Romanos' works were known simply as \"[[psalms]]\", \"[[ode]]s\", or \"[[poem]]s\".  It was only in the ninth century that the term kontakion came into use.\n\nAmong his known works are kontakia on:\n*The Nativity of Christ\n*The [[Martyr]]dom of [[St Stephen]]\n*The Death of a [[Monk]]\n*The [[last judgment|Last Judgment]]\n*The [[Prodigal Son]]\n*The Raising of Lazarus (for [[Lazarus Saturday]], the day before Palm Sunday)\n*Adam's Lament (for [[Palm Sunday]])\n*The Treachery of [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]\n\nHis Kontakion of the Nativity is still considered to be his masterpiece, and up until the twelfth century it was sung every year at the imperial banquet on that feast by the joint choirs of Hagia Sophia and of the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]] in Constantinople. Most of the poem takes the form of a dialogue between the Mother of God and the [[Magi]], whose visit to the newborn [[Christ Child]] is celebrated in the Byzantine rite on 25 December, rather than on the 6th of January when Western Christians celebrate the visit (in the Orthodox Church, January 6, the [[Epiphany (Christian)#Eastern Christian Churches|Feast of the Theophany]], celebrates the Baptism of Christ).\n\nOf his other Kontakia, one of the most well-known is the hymn, \"My soul, my soul, why sleepest thou...\"<ref>{{lang-grc|\u03a8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5, \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5, \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1, \u03c4\u03af \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03b5\u03cd\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2; \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f10\u03b3\u03b3\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b8\u03bf\u03c1\u03c5\u03b2\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9\u00b7 \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7\u03c8\u03bf\u03bd \u03bf\u1f56\u03bd, \u1f35\u03bd\u03b1 \u03c6\u03b5\u03af\u03c3\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1\u03af \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f41 \u0398\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2, \u1f41 \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u1f7c\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bd|translation=Arise, O my soul, O my soul, why sleepest thou?

Most recent scholarship has asserted that he is not the author of the hymn, although there is significant dissent among scholars.<ref>See [https://books.google.com/books?id=GhA3DAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA77&ots=qzrlUOmo_v&dq=changing%20conceptions%20of%20mary%20in%20sixth-century%20byzantium&pg=PA81#v=onepage&q=i%20do%20not%20believe%20that%20romanos&f=false page 81, note 13] in Sarah Gador-Whyte, \u201cChanging Conceptions of Mary in Sixth-Century Byzantium: The Kontakia of Romanos the Melodist,\u201d in ''Questions of Gender in Byzantine Society'', edited by Bronwen Neil and Lynda Garland, 77\u201392 (Farnham: Ashgate, 2013).</ref>\n\nProf Krumbacher published in Munich several previously unpublished chants of Romanos and other hymnographers, from manuscripts discovered in the library of the Monastery of St John the Theologian in [[Patmos]]. There exists in the library of [[Moscow]] a Greek [[manuscript]] which contains kontakia and oikoi for the whole year, but does not include all compositions of Romanos.\n\n[[Karl Krumbacher|Professor Krumbacher]] says of his work:\n<blockquote> In poetic talent, fire of inspiration, depth of feeling, and elevation of language, he far surpasses all the other melodes. The literary history of the future will perhaps acclaim Romanos for the greatest ecclesiastical poet of all ages.</blockquote>\n\n==Iconographic depiction==\n:''For further information, see the Attributes section of the infobox at the top of this page.''\n\nAlthough in more recent icons Saint Romanos is depicted standing on the ambo (directly in front of the [[iconostasis]]) and wearing a deacon's [[sticharion]], the famous Russian church [[musicologist]], [[Johann von Gardner]], points out that in the oldest icons he is portrayed wearing the shorter red [[tunic]] of a [[chanter|singer]] and standing on a raised platform in the middle of the church.\n\nIn the Eastern Church, Saint Romanos is the [[patron saint]] of church singers.\n\n==Editions and translations==\n*''Sancti Romani Melodi Cantica.''

Arresting imagery, sharp metaphors and similes, bold comparisons, antitheses, coining of successful maxims, and vivid dramatization characterize his style.\n\nHe is said to have composed more than 1,000 [[hymn]]s or ''kontakia'' celebrating various festivals of the [[ecclesiastical year]], the lives of the [[saint]]s and other sacred subjects,<ref name=EB1911/> some 60 to 80 of which survive (though not all those attributed to him may be genuine).\n\nToday, usually only the first [[strophe]] of each kontakion is chanted during the [[canonical hours|divine services]], the full hymn having been replaced by the [[canon (hymnography)|canon]]. A full kontakion was a poetic [[sermon]] composed of from 18 to 30 verses or ''[[Oikos|ikoi]]'', each with a refrain, and united by an [[acrostic]].  When it was sung to an original melody, it was called an ''[[idiomelon]]''.  Originally, Saint Romanos' works were known simply as \"[[psalms]]\", \"[[ode]]s\", or \"[[poem]]s\".  It was only in the ninth century that the term kontakion came into use.\n\nAmong his known works are kontakia on:\n*The Nativity of Christ\n*The [[Martyr]]dom of [[St Stephen]]\n*The Death of a [[Monk]]\n*The [[last judgment|Last Judgment]]\n*The [[Prodigal Son]]\n*The Raising of Lazarus (for [[Lazarus Saturday]], the day before Palm Sunday)\n*Adam's Lament (for [[Palm Sunday]])\n*The Treachery of [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]\n\nHis Kontakion of the Nativity is still considered to be his masterpiece, and up until the twelfth century, it was sung every year at the imperial banquet on that feast by the joint choirs of Hagia Sophia and of the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]] in Constantinople. Most of the poem takes the form of a dialogue between the Mother of God and the [[Magi]], whose visit to the newborn [[Christ Child]] is celebrated in the Byzantine rite on 25 December, rather than on the 6th of January, when Western Christians celebrate the visit (in the Orthodox Church, January 6, the [[Epiphany (Christian)#Eastern Christian Churches|Feast of the Theophany]], celebrates the Baptism of Christ).\n\nOf his other Kontakia, one of the most well-known is the hymn, \"My soul, my soul, why sleepest thou...\"<ref>{{lang-grc|\u03a8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5, \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5, \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1, \u03c4\u03af \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03b5\u03cd\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2; \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f10\u03b3\u03b3\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b8\u03bf\u03c1\u03c5\u03b2\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9\u00b7 \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7\u03c8\u03bf\u03bd \u03bf\u1f56\u03bd, \u1f35\u03bd\u03b1 \u03c6\u03b5\u03af\u03c3\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1\u03af \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f41 \u0398\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2, \u1f41 \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u1f7c\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bd|translation=Arise, O my soul, O my soul, why sleepest thou?

Most recent scholarship has asserted that he is not the author of the hymn, although there is significant dissent among scholars.<ref>See [https://books.google.com/books?id=GhA3DAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA77&ots=qzrlUOmo_v&dq=changing%20conceptions%20of%20mary%20in%20sixth-century%20byzantium&pg=PA81#v=onepage&q=i%20do%20not%20believe%20that%20romanos&f=false page 81, note 13] in Sarah Gador-Whyte, \u201cChanging Conceptions of Mary in Sixth-Century Byzantium: The Kontakia of Romanos the Melodist,\u201d in ''Questions of Gender in Byzantine Society'', edited by Bronwen Neil and Lynda Garland, 77\u201392 (Farnham: Ashgate, 2013).</ref>\n\nProf Krumbacher published in Munich several previously unpublished chants of Romanos and other hymnographers, from manuscripts discovered in the library of the Monastery of St John the Theologian in [[Patmos]]. There exists in the library of [[Moscow]] a Greek [[manuscript]] which contains kontakia and oikoi for the whole year, but does not include all compositions of Romanos.\n\n[[Karl Krumbacher|Professor Krumbacher]] says of his work:\n<blockquote> \"In poetic talent, fire of inspiration, depth of feeling, and elevation of language, he far surpasses all the other melodes. The literary history of the future will perhaps acclaim Romanos for the greatest ecclesiastical poet of all ages.\"</blockquote>\n\n==Iconographic depiction==\n:''For further information, see the Attributes section of the infobox at the top of this page.''\n\nAlthough in more recent icons Saint Romanos is depicted standing on the ambo (directly in front of the [[iconostasis]]) and wearing a deacon's [[sticharion]], the famous Russian church [[musicologist]], [[Johann von Gardner]], points out that in the oldest icons he is portrayed wearing the shorter red [[tunic]] of a [[chanter|singer]] and standing on a raised platform in the middle of the church.\n\nIn the Eastern Church, Saint Romanos is the [[patron saint]] of church singers.\n\n==Editions and translations==\n*''Sancti Romani Melodi Cantica.''

Historically, some 2,000 units of the [[Megola]] were produced between 1921\u20131925 with front wheel drive,<ref>Revoluntionary eccentricities: A survey of the rotary engine over the years.

Reverse gear is occasionally found on heavy [[Touring motorcycle|tourers]], for example the [[Honda Gold Wing|Honda GL1600]], and [[sidecar]] motorcycles, such as the [[IMZ-Ural|Ural]]. The rider changes gears on most motorcycles using a foot-pedal and manual clutch, but early models had hand-levers. More recently, some have automatic or semi-automatic gearboxes.\n\nOutside the United States, engine [[Engine displacement|capacities]] typically ranged from about 50&nbsp;cc to 650&nbsp;cc; but in Europe since 1968 motorcycles with larger capacities have become common, ranging as high as the [[Triumph Rocket 3]]'s {{Convert|2300|cc}} engine.

Diesel motorcycles were also experimented with briefly in the 20th century, and are again the subject of interest due to fuel economy and the needs of military logistics. The USMC has ordered a new diesel motorcycle, the M1030 M1, that can use the same fuel, [[JP-8]], as the rest of their armored vehicles, aircraft, cars and trucks.<ref name=Ford2008>{{Citation |last=Ford |first=Dexter |title=Diesel-Sipping Motorcycle for the Marines |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |issn=0362-4331 |date=24 February 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/automobiles/24KAWASAKI.html }}</ref>\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the motorcycles produced and used in the world today have small displacement air-cooled single-cylinder engines, both two- and four-strokes.{{Citation needed |date=January 2010}}  In the wealthier parts of the world, Europe and Japan, larger displacements and multiple cylinders are common alongside small-displacement bikes required by various licensing and rider experience requirements, and so a very diverse range of sizes, cylinder numbers, configurations, and cooling systems are seen on the road. Many developed countries have graduated licensing, where a rider is licensed for a period of time to ride only smaller-displacement motorcycles before being allowed to ride larger ones. In the United States, there are no such mandates, and so the mix is skewed even further to the largest displacements, consumer demand drives manufacturers to offer their largest motorcycles to that country, and to export far fewer sub-{{Convert |600 |cc |abbr=on}} models to the American market.{{Citation needed |date=January 2010}}\n\n==Types==\nAlmost all production motorcycles have gasoline [[internal combustion engine]]s. Both [[four-stroke]] and [[two-stroke]] engines are used, but strict emission laws have led to far fewer two-strokes. A few have used [[Wankel engine|Wankel rotary engines]], but no Wankel bikes are currently in production. Motorcycle engines can be [[air-cooled engine|air cooled]] or [[Radiator (engine cooling)|liquid cooled]], and optionally include [[oil cooling]] as well. Some scooters use batteries and an [[electric motor]]. The 2009 TT races introduced a new category 'TTX' (renamed as [[TT Zero]]) for electric bikes using [[fuel-cell]]s or batteries.\n\nMotorcycle engines can be mounted [[Transverse engine|transversely]]; with the [[crankshaft]] aligned perpendicular to the frame or [[Longitudinal engine|longitudinally]], with the crankshaft parallel to the frame. Motorcycles with transversely mounted engines are more suited to have chain or belt final-drive. Motorcycles with longitudinally mounted engines are more suited for shaft final-drive.\n\n[[Scooter (motorcycle)|Motor scooters]] often have the [[swingarm|engine]] as part of the rear suspension, so the engine is not fixed rigidly to the main frame. Instead, the combined engine-transmission-swingarm assembly is pivoted to follow the road surface and is part of the \"[[unsprung weight]]\". The chain final-drive of scooters runs in an oil-bath within the engine casings.  [[underbone|\"Step-through\"]] motorcycles may have a rigidly fixed engine, or may have a scooter-type arrangement.\n\n==Two-stroke and four-stroke==\n[[Two-stroke engine]]s have fewer moving parts than four-stroke engines, and produce twice the number of power strokes per revolution.\n\nFuel economy is better in four-strokes due to more complete combustion of the intake charge in four-stroke engines.{{CN|date=February 2018}}\n\nNevertheless, two-strokes have been largely replaced on motorcycles in developed nations due to their environmental disadvantages. Cylinder lubrication is necessarily total-loss and this inevitably leads to a smokey exhaust, particularly on wide throttle openings. Two-stroke-engined motorcycles continue to be made in large numbers, but mostly off-road [[motocross]] low-power [[moped]]s, small [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]] and step-through [[underbone]]s where they still compete strongly with four-strokes (including the highest-selling motorcycle of all time, the 50&nbsp;cc [[Honda Super Cub]]). The major markets of two-stroke motorcycles are in [[dirt bikes]] and [[Developing country|developing nations]].\n\n==Cylinder heads (four-stroke)==\n{{Main |Cylinder head}}\n\nCylinder head design has a significant effect on the efficiency of combustion, and hence the power output of the engine. The head may be [[Moto Morini#Moto Morini 350 & 500 V-twins|flat]], in which case the combustion chamber resides within the cylinder and/or a [[heron head|depression in the piston crown]], but usually a \"dome\" within the cylinder head provides most of the combustion volume. Motorcycles use [[poppet valve]]s in a range of designs: [[side valve]], [[overhead valve]] (OHV) with [[pushrod]] operation, [[overhead cam]] (SOHC), and [[double overhead cam]] (DOHC).  A cylinder with [[desmodromic valve]]s may have three or even four camshafts. An OHC or DOHC cylinder head will have at least two valves per cylinder (1 inlet and 1 exhaust), but [[multi-valve]] engines may have three (2 inlet and 1 exhaust), or four (2 inlet and 2 exhaust), or even [[Yamaha Genesis engine|five]] (3 inlet and 2 exhaust). Cylinder heads are the hottest part of the engine and require adequate cooling, typically [[air cooling]], [[oil cooling]] or [[Radiator (engine cooling)|liquid cooling]].\n\nSome motorcycles such as Harley-Davidsons, Moto Guzzis and BMWs become identifiable by their cylinder-head types, namely [[Airhead (motorcycle)|airhead]], [[Harley-Davidson Panhead engine|panhead]], [[oilhead]], and even [[Harley-Davidson Knucklehead engine|knucklehead]].<ref name=Falco1999/><ref>{{Citation |title= HANDLEBARS; Ducati's GT Brings Back A Saucy Spirit of the '70s |first=Norman |last=Mayersohn |date=December 3, 2006 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E4DD1E3EF930A35751C1A9609C8B63 |quote=But 'desmo' has become a code word among enthusiasts, in much the same way that [[Chrysler Hemi engine|Hemi]] has become a rallying cry for performance-minded Dodge owners, and Ducati is smart not to abandon the mystique that has grown around it.}}</ref>  The Ducati [[Desmodromic valve|desmos]] head enables higher rpm to be achieved without detrimental [[valve float]] also known as [[valve bounce]].\n\n==Valve control in four-strokes==\n{{See also |Variable valve timing}}\n\nIn a [[Flathead engine|side-valve engine]], the valves are operated from the \"underhead\" cam without special valve gear. [[Overhead valve]] (OHV) engines have valves operated by pushrods. Single- and double-[[overhead camshaft]] (SOHC and DOHC, respectively) engines have overhead camshafts typically operated by chain, belt, gear train or bevel gear drive.\n\nThe earliest motorcycle engines had exhaust valves operated in the same way as a side-valve engine, but they had overhead intake valves held closed by a weak spring. The intake valve was opened by the suction caused by the intake stroke. As the need for mechanical control of the intake valve arose, the design was modified by adding another cam to the camshaft and using a pushrod and rocker arm to operate the intake valve.<ref>{{Cite book |last= Wilson |first= Hugo |title= The Ultimate Motorcycle Book |year= 1993 |publisher= Dorling Kindersley |location= London |language= |isbn= 0-7513-0043-8 |page= 188 |chapter= Glossary |quote='''IOE''' Inlet over exhaust.

Later designs combined the two elements into a single \"unit construction\". Some manufacturers, such as Norton and Enfield continued with \"pre-unit\" construction until recently, and Harley-Davidson still makes pre-unit engines today.\n\nIn the early 1960s, [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|BSA]] introduced new short-stroke unit construction 500 and 650&nbsp;cc parallel twins to replace their existing pre-unit long-stroke engines. [[Triumph Engineering|Triumph]] modified their large pre-unit 500 and 650&nbsp;cc parallel twins into unit-construction engines. The smaller Triumph 350 and 500&nbsp;cc twins had been unit construction from their introduction in 1957. The decision by [[Lucas Industries|Lucas]] to discontinue making dynamos and magnetos, and to produce only alternators and coil ignition systems, was a significant factor in forcing the redesign.\n\nTraditionally, engines and gearboxes had separate lubrication systems with different grades of oil; but modern practice is to use the same oil for both.\n\n==Cylinders and configuration==\nThe majority of motorcycle engines are configured as singles, parallel twins, triples, fours and sixes; and all these may be inline or transverse. Vee engines include V-twins and V-fours, and horizontally opposed engines include flat-twins, flat-fours and flat-sixes. Wankel engines are either single-rotor or twin-rotor. Bigger bikes tend to have more cylinders for smoothness and increased power. Modern singles range in capacity from 50&nbsp;cc to 660&nbsp;cc, twins from 175&nbsp;cc to 1,800&nbsp;cc, triples from 380&nbsp;cc to 2,300&nbsp;cc, and so on.\n\n===Single===\n[[File:El Camino Motorcycle Show 0097 cropped.jpg |thumb |1960 [[BSA Gold Star]]]]\n{{Main |Single-cylinder engine}}\n[[Single-cylinder engine]]s ({{aka}} \"singles\" or \"thumpers\") have the cylinder vertical, inclined or horizontal, the last type most common in [[underbone|step-through]] motorcycles. Single-cylinder engines require both a larger [[flywheel]] and a heavier-duty gearbox than multicylinder engines. Small singles are cheap to build and maintain and are suitable as cheap utility motorcycles.\n\nUntil the mid-1960s, road-racing machines, like the UK's Matchless, AJS and Norton, tended to be large singles, but since then multicylinder racers have become the norm. [[Types of motorcycles#Off-road|Off-road]] and smaller [[Types of motorcycles#Dual-sport|dual-sport]] bikes tend to use single-cylinder engines. The simplicity of these engines, often relying on a single carburetor, make them relatively easy to maintain and repair in remote locations with few tools.\n\nCompared to lightweight off-road singles, the modern category of heavier off-road [[Types of motorcycles#Dual-sport|adventure]] bikes tend to forgo such simplicity, and instead have larger and more powerful parallel-twin, flat-twin, or V-twin engines.\n\n===Twin===\n{{anchor |s2|Straight2}}\n;Straight-twin\n[[File:1962 Honda CB77 Superhawk 305 cc twin engine.jpg |thumb |left |1962 [[Honda CB77]] Superhawk {{Convert |305 |cc |cuin |abbr=on}} twin engine.]]\n{{Main |Straight-twin engine}}\nStarting with [[Edward Turner]]'s 1937 [[Triumph Speed Twin]] design, and until the mid-1970s, the parallel-twin was the most common British motorcycle type. Parallel-twins are usually mounted transversely, with the cylinders side by side above the crankshaft, and with exhaust pipes at the front, in the cool airstream. Longitudinal, or inline, twins include the 500&nbsp;cc [[Sunbeam S7 and S8]]. There are three crankshaft configurations for this engine: 360\u00b0, 180\u00b0, and the newer 270\u00b0. Parallel twins usually have only two main bearings.\n\n{{anchor |v2|V2}}\n;V-twin\n[[File:Sportster 883 V-twin.jpg |thumb |[[Harley-Davidson Sportster]] V-twin]]\n{{Main |V-twin engine}}\nIn a V-twin engine the cylinders form a \"V\" around the [[V-twin engine#Crankshaft configuration|crankshaft]]. A Vee-angle of 90\u00b0, as used by Ducati and Moto Guzzi, can give perfect primary and secondary balance, with a pleasingly irregular firing order. A lesser angle gives a more compact motor, but one which is prone to vibration, such as 42\u00b0 (Indian), 45\u00b0 (Harley-Davidson), 52\u00b0 [[Honda Transalp|Honda]], and 60\u00b0 (Aprilia). Most V-twins have a single crankpin shared by side-by-side connecting rods so that the cylinders are slightly offset, but a variation is to have a single crankpin with [[connecting rod#Compound rods|\"fork & blade\"]] con-rods, to keep the cylinders in line. Non-90\u00b0 V-twins may have offset crankpins to try to reduce vibration.\n\nV-twins may be mounted either longitudinally with the cylinders protruding either side, like the [[Honda CX500]] and [[Moto Guzzi]], or transversely, such as Harley-Davidson, Ducati, or Aprilia.<ref>[http://www.westcoastbikers.com/v-twin-design-engineering] V-twin Design Engineering (Retrieved 26 November 2006)</ref>  Transverse V-twins can raise difficulties in cooling the aft cylinder, and in siting the airbox, battery, aft carburetor, and aft exhaust pipe.\n\n{{anchor |f2|Flat2}}\n;Flat-twin\n[[File:R68-opposed-cylinders.jpg |thumb|left |BMW's opposed twin on a 1954 R68]]\n{{Main |Flat-twin engine}}\nIn a flat-twin, or boxer, engine the cylinders are horizontally opposed. The boxer has perfect [[Engine balance|primary balance]], and only a small rocking couple, and unlike a V-twin, regular firing intervals, producing very low vibration levels, without the use of counterbalance shafts. They are usually mounted with a longitudinal crankshaft, with the cylinders protruding into the airstream, so that a flat-twin can satisfactorily be air-cooled. Flat-twins are made by [[BMW Motorrad|BMW]] and [[IMZ-Ural|Ural]] and historically by [[Douglas (motorcycles)|Douglas]], [[Marusho]], and [[Hoffmann (motorcycle)|Hoffmann]], among others. The longitudinal mounting makes the flat twin highly suitable for shaft final drive.\n\nSome early motorcycles used transverse-crank flat twin engines, especially Douglas motorcycles before World War II.\n\n{{anchor |t2|Tandem2}}\n;Tandem twin\n{{Main |U engine}}\n\nThe Tandem Twin where the cylinders are longitudinal, and have two cranks geared together such as [[Kawasaki Motorcycle Corporation|Kawasaki]]'s KR250 road bike and KR250 and KR350 GP Bikes. A tandem twin is effectively a pair of geared singles, and is to be distinguished from an inline twin such as the Sunbeam S7. Tandem twins are suitable primarily for two-stroke racers.\n\n===Triple===\n;Inline triple\n[[File:Triumph Rocket III engine.jpg |thumb|Triumph Rocket III inline-3]]\n{{Main |Straight-three engine}}\nThree-cylinder engines, a.k.a.  [[inline-triple engine|triples]], are normally mounted transversely. The British [[Hinckley]] Triumph factory has specialized in transverse triples, although their 2,300&nbsp;cc [[Triumph Rocket III|Rocket III]] has its engine mounted longitudinally. Other examples are the [[Benelli (motorcycles)|Benelli']] \"Tre\"and the [[Yamaha XS750]]. The Italian firm [[Laverda]] made a few 1,000&nbsp;cc and 1,200&nbsp;cc triples. Some Laverda Triples had 120\u00b0 cranks, while some had 180\u00b0 cranks, essentially three-quarters of a four. [[BMW Motorrad|BMW]] made the [[BMW K75|K75]] longitudinally mounted 750&nbsp;cc triple with the cylinders parallel to the ground. Meriden Triumph developed the 750&nbsp;cc Trident, from which BSA \"badge-engineered\" the Rocket-3.\n\nSome triples were two-strokes. The [[Kawasaki triple]]s were produced with capacities of 250, 350, 400, 500, and 750&nbsp;cc in the 1970s, while Suzuki produced 380, 550, and 750 triples, the last being water-cooled. Motobecane made 350&nbsp;cc and fuel-injected 500&nbsp;cc triples with 3 into 4 pipes in the early seventies. Honda produced the water-cooled V-3 two-strokes MVX250 and NS400. There have been various race bike triples such as Kawasaki KR750, Suzuki TR750 transverse 3s, and Proton/Modenas KR3, Honda NS500 V-3s.\n\n===Four===\nFour-cylinder engines are most commonly found in a transverse-mounted [[straight-4|inline four]] layout, although some are longitudinal, as in the earlier [[BMW K100]].

The German manufacturer [[M\u00fcnch (motorcycles)|M\u00fcnch]] based their motorcycles on four-cylinder car engines. For example, the Mammut 2000 has a 2.0l with a turbo and cylinder heads by [[Cosworth]].\n\n{{anchor |f4|Flat4}}\n;Flat four\n[[File:Honda-flat4.jpg |thumb|The Honda GL1000 flat-four]]\n{{Main |Flat-four engine}}\n{{Expand section |date=December 2009}}\nA flat-4 or horizontally opposed-4 is a flat engine with four cylinders arranged horizontally in two banks of two cylinders on each side of a central crankcase. The pistons are usually mounted on the crankshaft such that opposing pistons move back and forth in opposite directions at the same time, somewhat like a boxing competitor punching their gloves together before a fight, which has led to it being referred to as a boxer engine.\nThe configuration results in inherently good balance of the reciprocating parts, a low centre of gravity, and a very short engine length.\n\n{{anchor |v4|V4}}\n;V4\n[[File:Honda VFR 1200F Dual Clutch Engine.jpg |thumb |left |upright |[[Honda VFR1200F]] engine with dual clutch transmission.]]\n{{Main |V4 engine}}\nHonda uses [[V4 engine]]s in the [[Honda ST series|ST series]] and [[Honda VF and VFR|VFR series]]. As for two-stroke engines, there were four cylinders in the smaller classes such as Kawasaki's 125&nbsp;cc KR3 square 4 and [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]]'s 250&nbsp;cc RD500 V4 (RZ 500 in the US). Yamaha later raced transverse four TZ500/700/750's and virtually all the bikes in the last decade of the two-stroke GP500 era were fours, first squares then Vs, by Honda, Kawasaki, Cagiva, Suzuki, Yamaha. Kawasaki also experimented with a trapezoidal four the 602S. Yamaha made the V4 RD500LC, and Suzuki the RG400 and RG500 square four road bikes.\n\n{{anchor |s4|Square4}}\n;Square four\n{{Main |U engine#Square four engine}}\nA square four is a U engine with two cylinders on each side. This configuration was used on the [[Ariel Square Four]] motorcycle from 1931 to 1959. This design was revived as a two-stroke version on some racing [[Suzuki]] models, and their subsequent road-going version the [[Suzuki RG500|RG500]]. Although some racing success was achieved, the road bikes didn't sell in great numbers, and the design was phased out in favor of in-line, four-stroke designs, as at the time two-stroke engines were quickly being superseded by more economical, reliable, and emissions-friendly four-strokes.\n\n===Five===\n;V5\n[[File:Honda V5 Moto GP Engine (cropped).jpg |thumb|upright |Honda V5 MotoGP engine]]\n{{Main |V5 engine}}\nHonda has produced five-cylinder engines for racing, the RC211V 990&nbsp;cc V5.

The range was to include the single, a 400&nbsp;cc twin, a 600&nbsp;cc triple and a 1000&nbsp;cc V5.

Some custom and one-off motorcycles use more than six cylinders. For example, the [[Boss Hoss]] motorcycle uses (5,700&nbsp;cc, 6,000&nbsp;cc and 8,200&nbsp;cc) Chevrolet V-8 crate motors. In 2003 [[Daimler-Chrysler]] manufactured a limited number of [[Dodge Tomahawk|Tomahawk]] concept vehicles with a Dodge Viper V-10 engine. Australian company [[Drysdale V8|Drysdale]] have built short runs of 750&nbsp;cc V8 superbikes and 1L V8 roadgoing motorcycles, both with engines specifically developed for the purpose. No major motorcycle manufacturer has used eight or more cylinders, although Honda made the 'almost' V8 oval-piston NR750 road bike and NR500 GP bike, having eight connecting rods.

German manufacturer [[Hercules (motorcycle)|Hercules]], a member of the [[ZF Sachs|Sachs]]-controlled [[Zweirad Union]], produced their single-rotor W2000 from 1974 to 1977.

This includes their dispatch riders as well, encouraging the market for diesel motorcycles. Interest in biofuels is also likely to encourage future developments for small Diesels.\n\nDiesels are also available in both two- and four-stroke versions.\n\n==Engine cooling==\n\n===Liquid===\nLiquid-cooled motorcycles have a [[radiator (engine cooling)|radiator]], similar to the radiator on a car, which is the primary way their heat is dispersed. Coolant is constantly circulated between this radiator and the cylinders when the engine is running. While most off-road motorcycles have no radiator fan and rely on air flowing over the radiators from the forward motion of the motorcycle, many road motorcycles have a small fan attached to the radiator which is controlled by a thermostat. Some off-road motorcycles are liquid-cooled, and anti-dirt protection is attached to the radiator. The cooling effect of this fan is enough to prevent the engine overheating in most conditions, so liquid-cooled bikes are safe to use in a city, where traffic may frequently be at a standstill.\n\nEmissions regulations and the market demand for maximum power are driving the motorcycle industry to liquid-cooling for most motorcycles. Even Harley-Davidson, a strong advocate of air-cooled motors, has recently added water cooling to the heads of their V-twin motors in their large touring models, with the radiators being hidden in the lower leg fairings. The Harley-Davidson Street 500, Street 750, and two V-Rod models have 60\u00b0 V-twins that are fully water cooled, as opposed to the traditional air-cooled 45\u00b0 V-twins.\n\n===Air===\nMost air-cooled motorcycles take advantage of air blowing past the cylinder and cylinder head while in motion to disperse heat. Frequent, sustained stationary periods may cause overheating. Some models, mostly scooters, are equipped with fans that force the air to go past the cylinder block, which solves the problem of city driving. The cylinders on air-cooled bikes are designed with fin heat sinks to aid in this process. Air-cooled bikes are cheaper, simpler and lighter than their water-cooled counterparts.\n\n===Oil===\n[[File:R1150gs-front.jpg |thumb |upright |The [[BMW R1150GS]] has an oil cooler below the headlights and fins for air cooling on the cylinders]]\nSome manufacturers use a hybrid cooling method where engine oil is circulated between the engine case and a small radiator. Here the oil doubles as cooling liquid, prompting the name \"[[Oil cooling|oil-cooling]].\"  Suzuki has produced many oil-cooled motorcycles. Modern BMW R-series flat-twin motorcycles, such as the [[BMW R1150GS|R1150GS]], use air and oil cooling. Polaris's Victory motorcycles use oil/air cooling exclusively.\n\n==Other components==\n\n===Fuel Injection===\n[[Fuel injection]] and computer engine management systems are now normal on middle range and larger motorcycles and are increasingly being incorporated onto the smaller machines, partly driven by better emission control and lower maintenance but mostly by manufacturing cost considerations. Ignition systems moved from [[ignition magneto|magneto]] in the 1950s to battery-coil-contact breaker points, and these were increasingly superseded by [[Capacitor discharge ignition|Capacitor Discharge Ignition]] (CDI) from the 1980s. Small, single-cylinder motorcycles abandoned the flywheel magneto system with contact breakers to similar flywheel driven solid-state systems at about the same time.\n\n===Turbo and Superchargers===\n[[Supercharger]]s, or blowers, were common in the GPs, until they were banned. The first supercharger on a production motorcycle was the 2015 [[Kawasaki Ninja H2]] and H2R.<ref name=debut>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportrider.com/sportbike-news/kawasaki-officially-debuts-2015-ninja-h2r/// |last=Kunitsugu |first=Kent |title=Kawasaki officially debuts 2015 Ninja H2R |publisher=Sport Rider |accessdate=February 14, 2016 |date=September 30, 2014}}</ref> The big four made a turbocharged bike, and Honda made two, mainly as an exercise in technical expertise and later discontinued them for more conventional methods. Bolt-on superchargers are available for street bikes and are essential for performance applications such as drag bikes and land speed record streamliners. Most sports bikes now use a ram-air induction system where as road speed increases, more air is forced through ducts in the fairing to pressurize the airbox. The first on a production motorcycle was the 1990 [[Kawasaki Ninja ZX-11]].<ref name=ramairtest>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportrider.com/ram-air-test/// |title=Ram Air: Test |publisher=Sport Rider |accessdate=February 14, 2016 |date=October 1999}}</ref> Not to be confused with the original Ram-Air system where an air scoop/cowl was fitted to the top of the cylinder heads of Suzuki two-stroke engines to aid cooling.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of motorcycles by type of engine]]\n*[[Motorcycle motor powered car]]\n*[[List of motorized trikes]]\n*[[Aircraft engine]]\n\n{{Commons category |Motorcycle engines}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Motorcycle components}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Motorcycle Engine}}\n[[Category:Motorcycle engines| ]]\n[[Category:Engine technology]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use American English|date=November 2017}}\n[[File:Honda Super Cub at Seattle Children's Museum1.jpg |thumb |upright=1.25 |A [[Honda Super Cub]] engine.

Historically, some 2,000 units of the [[Megola]] were produced between 1921-1925 with front wheel drive,<ref>Revoluntionary eccentricities: A survey of the rotary engine over the years. ''Motorcycle Sport'', April 1983, pp.166-171, p.188 Accessed February 2019</ref> and the modern [[Rokon (motorcycle manufacturer)|Rokon]], an [[All-terrain vehicle|all terrain motorcycle]] with both wheels driven, has been produced since 1960.<ref>[https://www.rokon.com/about-rokon About Rokon] rokon.com Retrieved February 2019</ref>\n\nMost engines have a gearbox with up to six ratios. Reverse gear is occasionally found on heavy [[Touring motorcycle|tourers]], for example the [[Honda Gold Wing|Honda GL1600]], and [[sidecar]] motorcycles, such as the [[IMZ-Ural|Ural]]. The rider changes gears on most motorcycles using a foot-pedal and manual clutch, but early models had hand-levers. More recently, some have automatic or semi-automatic gearboxes.\n\nOutside the United States, engine [[Engine displacement|capacities]] typically ranged from about 50&nbsp;cc to 650&nbsp;cc; but in Europe since 1968 motorcycles with larger capacities have become common, ranging as high as the [[Triumph Rocket 3]]'s {{Convert|2300|cc}} engine.

Diesel motorcycles were also experimented with briefly in the 20th century, and are again the subject of interest due to fuel economy and the needs of military logistics.

Many developed countries have graduated licensing, where a rider is licensed for a period of time to ride only smaller-displacement motorcycles before being allowed to ride larger ones. In the United States, there are no such mandates, and so the mix is skewed even further to the largest displacements, consumer demand drives manufacturers to offer their largest motorcycles to that country, and to export far fewer sub-{{Convert |600 |cc |abbr=on}} models to the American market.{{Citation needed |date=January 2010}}\n\n==Types==\nAlmost all production motorcycles have gasoline [[internal combustion engine]]s. Both [[four-stroke]] and [[two-stroke]] engines are used, but strict emission laws have led to far fewer two-strokes. A few have used [[Wankel engine|Wankel rotary engines]], but no Wankel bikes are currently in production. Motorcycle engines can be [[air-cooled engine|air cooled]] or [[Radiator (engine cooling)|liquid cooled]], and optionally include [[oil cooling]] as well. Some scooters use batteries and an [[electric motor]]. The 2009 TT races introduced a new category 'TTX' (renamed as [[TT Zero]]) for electric bikes using [[fuel-cell]]s or batteries.\n\nMotorcycle engines can be mounted [[Transverse engine|transversely]]; with the [[crankshaft]] aligned perpendicular to the frame or [[Longitudinal engine|longitudinally]], with the crankshaft parallel to the frame. Motorcycles with transversely mounted engines are more suited to have chain or belt final-drive. Motorcycles with longitudinally mounted engines are more suited for shaft final-drive.\n\n[[Scooter (motorcycle)|Motor scooters]] often have the [[swingarm|engine]] as part of the rear suspension, so the engine is not fixed rigidly to the main frame. Instead, the combined engine-transmission-swingarm assembly is pivoted to follow the road surface and is part of the \"[[unsprung weight]]\". The chain final-drive of scooters runs in an oil-bath within the engine casings.  [[underbone|\"Step-through\"]] motorcycles may have a rigidly fixed engine, or may have a scooter-type arrangement.\n\n==Two-stroke and four-stroke==\n[[Two-stroke engine]]s have fewer moving parts than four-stroke engines, and produce twice the number of power strokes per revolution.\n\nFuel economy is better in four-strokes due to more complete combustion of the intake charge in four-stroke engines.{{CN|date=February 2018}}\n\nNevertheless, two-strokes have been largely replaced on motorcycles in developed nations due to their environmental disadvantages. Cylinder lubrication is necessarily total-loss and this inevitably leads to a smokey exhaust, particularly on wide throttle openings. Two-stroke-engined motorcycles continue to be made in large numbers, but mostly off road [[motocross]] low-power [[moped]]s, small [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]] and step-through [[underbone]]s where they still compete strongly with four-strokes (including the highest-selling motorcycle of all time, the 50&nbsp;cc [[Honda Super Cub]]). The major markets of two-stroke motorcycles are in [[dirt bikes]] and [[Developing country|developing nations]].\n\n==Cylinder heads (four-stroke)==\n{{Main |Cylinder head}}\n\nCylinder head design has a significant effect on the efficiency of combustion, and hence the power output of the engine. The head may be [[Moto Morini#Moto Morini 350 & 500 V-twins|flat]], in which case the combustion chamber resides within the cylinder and/or a [[heron head|depression in the piston crown]], but usually a \"dome\" within the cylinder head provides most of the combustion volume. Motorcycles use [[poppet valve]]s in a range of designs: [[side valve]], [[overhead valve]] (OHV) with [[pushrod]] operation, [[overhead cam]] (SOHC), and [[double overhead cam]] (DOHC).  A cylinder with [[desmodromic valve]]s may have three or even four camshafts. An OHC or DOHC cylinder head will have at least two valves per cylinder (1 inlet and 1 exhaust), but [[multi-valve]] engines may have three (2 inlet and 1 exhaust), or four (2 inlet and 2 exhaust), or even [[Yamaha Genesis engine|five]] (3 inlet and 2 exhaust). Cylinder heads are the hottest part of the engine and require adequate cooling, typically [[air cooling]], [[oil cooling]] or [[Radiator (engine cooling)|liquid cooling]].\n\nSome motorcycles such as Harley-Davidsons, Moto Guzzis and BMWs become identifiable by their cylinder-head types, namely [[Airhead (motorcycle)|airhead]], [[Harley-Davidson Panhead engine|panhead]], [[oilhead]], and even [[Harley-Davidson Knucklehead engine|knucklehead]].<ref name=Falco1999/><ref>{{Citation |title= HANDLEBARS; Ducati's GT Brings Back A Saucy Spirit of the '70s |first=Norman |last=Mayersohn |date=December 3, 2006 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E4DD1E3EF930A35751C1A9609C8B63 |quote=But 'desmo' has become a code word among enthusiasts, in much the same way that [[Chrysler Hemi engine|Hemi]] has become a rallying cry for performance-minded Dodge owners, and Ducati is smart not to abandon the mystique that has grown around it.}}</ref>  The Ducati [[Desmodromic valve|desmos]] head enables higher rpm to be achieved without detrimental [[valve float]] also known as [[valve bounce]].\n\n==Valve control in four-strokes==\n{{See also |Variable valve timing}}\n\nIn a [[Flathead engine|side-valve engine]], the valves are operated from the \"underhead\" cam without special valve gear. [[Overhead valve]] (OHV) engines have valves operated by pushrods. Single- and double-[[overhead camshaft]] (SOHC and DOHC, respectively) engines have overhead camshafts typically operated by chain, belt, gear train or bevel gear drive.\n\nThe earliest motorcycle engines had exhaust valves operated in the same way as a side-valve engine, but they had overhead intake valves held closed by a weak spring. The intake valve was opened by the suction caused by the intake stroke. As the need for mechanical control of the intake valve arose, the design was modified by adding another cam to the camshaft and using a pushrod and rocker arm to operate the intake valve.<ref>{{Cite book |last= Wilson |first= Hugo |title= The Ultimate Motorcycle Book |year= 1993 |publisher= Dorling Kindersley |location= London |language= |isbn= 0-7513-0043-8 |page= 188 |chapter= Glossary |quote='''IOE''' Inlet over exhaust.

Later designs combined the two elements into a single \"unit construction\". Some manufacturers, such as Norton and Enfield continued with \"pre-unit\" construction until recently, and Harley-Davidson still makes pre-unit engines today.\n\nIn the early 1960s, [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|BSA]] introduced new short-stroke unit construction 500 and 650&nbsp;cc parallel twins to replace their existing pre-unit long-stroke engines. [[Triumph Engineering|Triumph]] modified their large pre-unit 500 and 650&nbsp;cc parallel twins into unit-construction engines. The smaller Triumph 350 and 500&nbsp;cc twins had been unit construction from their introduction in 1957. The decision by [[Lucas Industries|Lucas]] to discontinue making dynamos and magnetos, and to produce only alternators and coil ignition systems, was a significant factor in forcing the redesign.\n\nTraditionally, engines and gearboxes had separate lubrication systems with different grades of oil; but modern practice is to use the same oil for both.\n\n==Cylinders and configuration==\nThe majority of motorcycle engines are configured as singles, parallel twins, triples, fours and sixes; and all these may be inline or transverse. Vee engines include V-twins and V-fours, and horizontally opposed engines include flat-twins, flat-fours and flat-sixes. Wankel engines are either single-rotor or twin-rotor. Bigger bikes tend to have more cylinders for smoothness and increased power. Modern singles range in capacity from 50&nbsp;cc to 660&nbsp;cc, twins from 175&nbsp;cc to 1,800&nbsp;cc, triples from 380&nbsp;cc to 2,300&nbsp;cc, and so on.\n\n===Single===\n[[File:El Camino Motorcycle Show 0097 cropped.jpg |thumb |1960 [[BSA Gold Star]]]]\n{{Main |Single-cylinder engine}}\n[[Single-cylinder engine]]s ({{aka}} \"singles\" or \"thumpers\") have the cylinder vertical, inclined or horizontal, the last type most common in [[underbone|step-through]] motorcycles. Single-cylinder engines require both a larger [[flywheel]] and a heavier-duty gearbox than multicylinder engines. Small singles are cheap to build and maintain and are suitable as cheap utility motorcycles.\n\nUntil the mid-1960s, road-racing machines, like the UK's Matchless, AJS and Norton, tended to be large singles, but since then multicylinder racers have become the norm. [[Types of motorcycles#Off-road|Off-road]] and smaller [[Types of motorcycles#Dual-sport|dual-sport]] bikes tend to use single-cylinder engines. The simplicity of these engines, often relying on a single carburetor, make them relatively easy to maintain and repair in remote locations with few tools.\n\nCompared to lightweight off-road singles, the modern category of heavier off-road [[Types of motorcycles#Dual-sport|adventure]] bikes tend to forgo such simplicity, and instead have larger and more powerful parallel-twin, flat-twin, or V-twin engines.\n\n===Twin===\n{{anchor |s2|Straight2}}\n;Straight-twin\n[[File:1962 Honda CB77 Superhawk 305 cc twin engine.jpg |thumb |left |1962 [[Honda CB77]] Superhawk {{Convert |305 |cc |cuin |abbr=on}} twin engine.]]\n{{Main |Straight-twin engine}}\nStarting with [[Edward Turner]]'s 1937 [[Triumph Speed Twin]] design, and until the mid-1970s, the parallel-twin was the most common British motorcycle type. Parallel-twins are usually mounted transversely, with the cylinders side by side above the crankshaft, and with exhaust pipes at the front, in the cool airstream. Longitudinal, or inline, twins include the 500&nbsp;cc [[Sunbeam S7 and S8]]. There are three crankshaft configurations for this engine: 360\u00b0, 180\u00b0, and the newer 270\u00b0. Parallel twins usually have only two main bearings.\n\n{{anchor |v2|V2}}\n;V-twin\n[[File:Sportster 883 V-twin.jpg |thumb |[[Harley-Davidson Sportster]] V-twin]]\n{{Main |V-twin engine}}\nIn a V-twin engine the cylinders form a \"V\" around the [[V-twin engine#Crankshaft configuration|crankshaft]]. A Vee-angle of 90\u00b0, as used by Ducati and Moto Guzzi, can give perfect primary and secondary balance, with a pleasingly irregular firing order. A lesser angle gives a more compact motor, but one which is prone to vibration, such as 42\u00b0 (Indian), 45\u00b0 (Harley-Davidson), 52\u00b0 [[Honda Transalp|Honda]], and 60\u00b0 (Aprilia). Most V-twins have a single crankpin shared by side-by-side connecting rods so that the cylinders are slightly offset, but a variation is to have a single crankpin with [[connecting rod#Compound rods|\"fork & blade\"]] con-rods, to keep the cylinders in line. Non-90\u00b0 V-twins may have offset crankpins to try to reduce vibration.\n\nV-twins may be mounted either longitudinally with the cylinders protruding either side, like the [[Honda CX500]] and [[Moto Guzzi]], or transversely, such as Harley-Davidson, Ducati, or Aprilia.<ref>[http://www.westcoastbikers.com/v-twin-design-engineering] V-twin Design Engineering (Retrieved 26 November 2006)</ref>  Transverse V-twins can raise difficulties in cooling the aft cylinder, and in siting the airbox, battery, aft carburetor, and aft exhaust pipe.\n\n{{anchor |f2|Flat2}}\n;Flat-twin\n[[File:R68-opposed-cylinders.jpg |thumb|left |BMW's opposed twin on a 1954 R68]]\n{{Main |Flat-twin engine}}\nIn a flat-twin, or boxer, engine the cylinders are horizontally opposed. The boxer has perfect [[Engine balance|primary balance]], and only a small rocking couple, and unlike a V-twin, regular firing intervals, producing very low vibration levels, without the use of counterbalance shafts. They are usually mounted with a longitudinal crankshaft, with the cylinders protruding into the airstream, so that a flat-twin can satisfactorily be air-cooled. Flat-twins are made by [[BMW Motorrad|BMW]] and [[IMZ-Ural|Ural]] and historically by [[Douglas (motorcycles)|Douglas]], [[Marusho]], and [[Hoffmann (motorcycle)|Hoffmann]], among others. The longitudinal mounting makes the flat twin highly suitable for shaft final drive.\n\nSome early motorcycles used transverse-crank flat twin engines, especially Douglas motorcycles before World War II.\n\n{{anchor |t2|Tandem2}}\n;Tandem twin\n{{Main |U engine}}\n\nThe Tandem Twin where the cylinders are longitudinal, and have two cranks geared together such as [[Kawasaki Motorcycle Corporation|Kawasaki]]'s KR250 road bike and KR250 and KR350 GP Bikes. A tandem twin is effectively a pair of geared singles, and is to be distinguished from an inline twin such as the Sunbeam S7. Tandem twins are suitable primarily for two-stroke racers.\n\n===Triple===\n;Inline triple\n[[File:Triumph Rocket III engine.jpg |thumb|Triumph Rocket III inline-3]]\n{{Main |Straight-three engine}}\nThree-cylinder engines, a.k.a.  [[inline-triple engine|triples]], are normally mounted transversely. The British [[Hinckley]] Triumph factory has specialized in transverse triples, although their 2,300&nbsp;cc [[Triumph Rocket III|Rocket III]] has its engine mounted longitudinally. Other examples are the [[Benelli (motorcycles)|Benelli']] \"Tre\"and the [[Yamaha XS750]]. The Italian firm [[Laverda]] made a few 1,000&nbsp;cc and 1,200&nbsp;cc triples. Some Laverda Triples had 120\u00b0 cranks, while some had 180\u00b0 cranks, essentially three-quarters of a four. [[BMW Motorrad|BMW]] made the [[BMW K75|K75]] longitudinally mounted 750&nbsp;cc triple with the cylinders parallel to the ground. Meriden Triumph developed the 750&nbsp;cc Trident, from which BSA \"badge-engineered\" the Rocket-3.\n\nSome triples were two-strokes. The [[Kawasaki triple]]s were produced with capacities of 250, 350, 400, 500, and 750&nbsp;cc in the 1970s, while Suzuki produced 380, 550, and 750 triples, the last being water-cooled. Motobecane made 350&nbsp;cc and fuel-injected 500&nbsp;cc triples with 3 into 4 pipes in the early seventies. Honda produced the water-cooled V-3 two-strokes MVX250 and NS400. There have been various race bike triples such as Kawasaki KR750, Suzuki TR750 transverse 3s, and Proton/Modenas KR3, Honda NS500 V-3s.\n\n===Four===\nFour-cylinder engines are most commonly found in a transverse-mounted [[straight-4|inline four]] layout, although some are longitudinal, as in the earlier [[BMW K100]].  [[V4 engine|V-4]] and [[flat-four engine|boxer]] designs, as in the earlier [[Honda Gold Wing]], have been produced. One of the more unusual designs was the [[Ariel Square Four]], effectively two parallel-twin engines one in front of the other in a common crankcase \u2014 it had remarkably little vibration due to the contra-rotating crankshafts.\n\n{{anchor |i4|Inline4}}\n;Inline four\n[[File:Honda CB750 Special 2007TMS cropped.jpg |left |thumb |upright |[[Honda CB750]] transverse inline-4]]   {{Main |Inline-four engine}}\n{{Expand section |date=April 2010}}\nProduction of four cylinder motorcycles began with the [[FN Four]] in 1905.

The German manufacturer [[M\u00fcnch (motorcycles)|M\u00fcnch]] based their motorcycles on four-cylinder car engines. For example, the Mammut 2000 has a 2.0l with a turbo and cylinder heads by [[Cosworth]].\n\n{{anchor |f4|Flat4}}\n;Flat four\n[[File:Honda-flat4.jpg |thumb|The Honda GL1000 flat-four]]\n{{Main |Flat-four engine}}\n{{Expand section |date=December 2009}}\nA flat-4 or horizontally opposed-4 is a flat engine with four cylinders arranged horizontally in two banks of two cylinders on each side of a central crankcase. The pistons are usually mounted on the crankshaft such that opposing pistons move back and forth in opposite directions at the same time, somewhat like a boxing competitor punching their gloves together before a fight, which has led to it being referred to as a boxer engine.\nThe configuration results in inherently good balance of the reciprocating parts, a low centre of gravity, and a very short engine length.\n\n{{anchor |v4|V4}}\n;V4\n[[File:Honda VFR 1200F Dual Clutch Engine.jpg |thumb |left |upright |[[Honda VFR1200F]] engine with dual clutch transmission.]]\n{{Main |V4 engine}}\nHonda uses [[V4 engine]]s in the [[Honda ST series|ST series]] and [[Honda VF and VFR|VFR series]]. As for two-stroke engines, there were four cylinders in the smaller classes such as Kawasaki's 125&nbsp;cc KR3 square 4 and [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]]'s 250&nbsp;cc RD500 V4 (RZ 500 in the US). Yamaha later raced transverse four TZ500/700/750's and virtually all the bikes in the last decade of the two-stroke GP500 era were fours, first squares then Vs, by Honda, Kawasaki, Cagiva, Suzuki, Yamaha. Kawasaki also experimented with a trapezoidal four the 602S. Yamaha made the V4 RD500LC, and Suzuki the RG400 and RG500 square four road bikes.\n\n{{anchor |s4|Square4}}\n;Square four\n{{Main |U engine#Square four engine}}\nA square four is a U engine with two cylinders on each side. This configuration was used on the [[Ariel Square Four]] motorcycle from 1931 to 1959. This design was revived as a two-stroke version on some racing [[Suzuki]] models, and their subsequent road-going version the [[Suzuki RG500|RG500]]. Although some racing success was achieved, the road bikes didn't sell in great numbers, and the design was phased out in favor of in-line, four-stroke designs, as at the time two-stroke engines were quickly being superseded by more economical, reliable, and emissions-friendly four-strokes.\n\n===Five===\n;V5\n[[File:Honda V5 Moto GP Engine (cropped).jpg |thumb|upright |Honda V5 MotoGP engine]]\n{{Main |V5 engine}}\nHonda has produced five-cylinder engines for racing, the RC211V 990&nbsp;cc V5. No V5 engines are currently available in commercial production motorcycles.\n\nJust prior to their collapse, [[Birmingham Small Arms|BSA]] planned a modular family of bike engines based around a 200&nbsp;cc single. The range was to include the single, a 400&nbsp;cc twin, a 600&nbsp;cc triple and a 1000&nbsp;cc V5. None of these motorcycles reached production.<ref>\"Bike\" magazine February? 1973</ref>\n\n===Six===\n;Inline six\n[[File:Benelli Sei Engine.jpg |thumb |left |[[Benelli Sei]] inline-6]]\n{{Main |Straight-six engine}}\nThe 1,047&nbsp;cc [[Honda CBX]] was produced from 1978 to 1982.

Honda made a 250&nbsp;cc straight-six GP bike.

Some custom and one-off motorcycles use more than six cylinders. For example, the [[Boss Hoss]] motorcycle uses (5,700&nbsp;cc, 6,000&nbsp;cc and 8,200&nbsp;cc) Chevrolet V-8 crate motors. In 2003 [[Daimler-Chrysler]] manufactured a limited number of [[Dodge Tomahawk|Tomahawk]] concept vehicles with a Dodge Viper V-10 engine. Australian company [[Drysdale V8|Drysdale]] have built short runs of 750&nbsp;cc V8 superbikes and 1L V8 roadgoing motorcycles, both with engines specifically developed for the purpose. No major motorcycle manufacturer has used eight or more cylinders, although Honda made the 'almost' V8 oval-piston NR750 road bike and NR500 GP bike, having eight connecting rods.

This includes their dispatch riders as well, encouraging the market for diesel motorcycles. Interest in biofuels is also likely to encourage future developments for small Diesels.\n\nDiesels are also available in both two- and four-stroke versions.\n\n==Engine cooling==\n\n===Liquid===\nLiquid-cooled motorcycles have a [[radiator (engine cooling)|radiator]], similar to the radiator on a car, which is the primary way their heat is dispersed. Coolant is constantly circulated between this radiator and the cylinders when the engine is running. While most off-road motorcycles have no radiator fan and rely on air flowing over the radiators from the forward motion of the motorcycle, many road motorcycles have a small fan attached to the radiator which is controlled by a thermostat. Some off-road motorcycles are liquid-cooled, and anti-dirt protection is attached to the radiator. The cooling effect of this fan is enough to prevent the engine overheating in most conditions, so liquid-cooled bikes are safe to use in a city, where traffic may frequently be at a standstill.\n\nEmissions regulations and the market demand for maximum power are driving the motorcycle industry to liquid-cooling for most motorcycles. Even Harley-Davidson, a strong advocate of air-cooled motors, has recently added water cooling to the heads of their V-twin motors in their large touring models, with the radiators being hidden in the lower leg fairings. The Harley-Davidson Street 500, Street 750, and two V-Rod models have 60\u00b0 V-twins that are fully water cooled, as opposed to the traditional air-cooled 45\u00b0 V-twins.\n\n===Air===\nMost air-cooled motorcycles take advantage of air blowing past the cylinder and cylinder head while in motion to disperse heat. Frequent, sustained stationary periods may cause overheating. Some models, mostly scooters, are equipped with fans that force the air to go past the cylinder block, which solves the problem of city driving. The cylinders on air-cooled bikes are designed with fin heat sinks to aid in this process. Air-cooled bikes are cheaper, simpler and lighter than their water-cooled counterparts.\n\n===Oil===\n[[File:R1150gs-front.jpg |thumb |upright |The [[BMW R1150GS]] has an oil cooler below the headlights and fins for air cooling on the cylinders]]\nSome manufacturers use a hybrid cooling method where engine oil is circulated between the engine case and a small radiator. Here the oil doubles as cooling liquid, prompting the name \"[[Oil cooling|oil-cooling]].\"  Suzuki has produced many oil-cooled motorcycles. Modern BMW R-series flat-twin motorcycles, such as the [[BMW R1150GS|R1150GS]], use air and oil cooling. Polaris's Victory motorcycles use oil/air cooling exclusively.\n\n==Other components==\n\n===Fuel Injection===\n[[Fuel injection]] and computer engine management systems are now normal on middle range and larger motorcycles and are increasingly being incorporated onto the smaller machines, partly driven by better emission control and lower maintenance but mostly by manufacturing cost considerations. Ignition systems moved from [[ignition magneto|magneto]] in the 1950s to battery-coil-contact breaker points, and these were increasingly superseded by [[Capacitor discharge ignition|Capacitor Discharge Ignition]] (CDI) from the 1980s. Small, single-cylinder motorcycles abandoned the flywheel magneto system with contact breakers to similar flywheel driven solid-state systems at about the same time.\n\n===Turbo and Superchargers===\n[[Supercharger]]s, or blowers, were common in the GPs, until they were banned. The first supercharger on a production motorcycle was the 2015 [[Kawasaki Ninja H2]] and H2R.<ref name=debut>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportrider.com/sportbike-news/kawasaki-officially-debuts-2015-ninja-h2r/// |last=Kunitsugu |first=Kent |title=Kawasaki officially debuts 2015 Ninja H2R |publisher=Sport Rider |accessdate=February 14, 2016 |date=September 30, 2014}}</ref> The big four made a turbocharged bike, and Honda made two, mainly as an exercise in technical expertise and later discontinued them for more conventional methods. Bolt-on superchargers are available for street bikes and are essential for performance applications such as drag bikes and land speed record streamliners. Most sports bikes now use a ram-air induction system where as road speed increases, more air is forced through ducts in the fairing to pressurize the airbox. The first on a production motorcycle was the 1990 [[Kawasaki Ninja ZX-11]].<ref name=ramairtest>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportrider.com/ram-air-test/// |title=Ram Air: Test |publisher=Sport Rider |accessdate=February 14, 2016 |date=October 1999}}</ref> Not to be confused with the original Ram-Air system where an air scoop/cowl was fitted to the top of the cylinder heads of Suzuki two-stroke engines to aid cooling.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of motorcycles by type of engine]]\n*[[Motorcycle motor powered car]]\n*[[List of motorized trikes]]\n*[[Aircraft engine]]\n\n{{Commons category |Motorcycle engines}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Motorcycle components}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Motorcycle Engine}}\n[[Category:Motorcycle engines| ]]\n[[Category:Engine technology]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 1921-1925 \u2192 1921\u20131925, off road \u2192 off-road", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle_engine"}

He is best known for his contributions to the field of [[external ballistics|exterior ballistics]].\n\n==Biography==\nSiacci graduated from the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]] in 1860 and received an honorary degree in [[mathematics]].

In 1871, he began teaching mechanics in the [[University of Turin]]. A year later, he was promoted to Professor of Ballistics at the School of Applied Artillery and Engineering in Turin and held that post until his retirement from the army as a [[major general]] in 1892. In 1875, he became a Professor of Higher Mechanics in the University of Turin.\n\nAfter two terms as a deputy in 1892, Siacci was appointed as a [[Italian Senate|senator in Rome]] in 1893.

Consequently, [[Vito Volterra]] took over his vacated position in Turin, but Siacci retained an honorary professorship there. Siacci stayed to teach in Naples for the rest of his life.\n\nSiacci was a member of the most important national academies in Italy, including the [[Accademia dei Lincei]] (corresponding member in 1872, full member in 1890), the [[Accademia nazionale delle scienze|Accademia Nazionale delle Scienze detta dei XL]], the Accademia delle Scienze in Turin, and the Accademia delle Scienze Fisiche e Matematiche in Naples.\n\nA street in Rome, the Via Francesco Siacci, is named after him.\n\n==Exterior ballistics==\nSiacci is well known for his contributions in the field of [[ballistics]], distinguishing himself with a famous treatise ''Balistica'', published in 1888 and translated to French in 1891.

Several modifications of the method are still in use today, including those of H.P. Hitchcock and R.H. Kent, and [[James Monroe Ingalls|James Ingalls]].
