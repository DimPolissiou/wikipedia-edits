He is sometimes numbered ''Theodoric I'' if the Dukes of the House of [[Ardennes]], who ruled in [[Upper Lorraine]] from 959 to 1033, are ignored in favour of the [[Duke of Lower Lorraine|dukes of Lower Lorraine]] as predecessors of the later Dukes of Lorraine.\n\nIn fact, [[Sophie, Countess of Bar|Sophia]], the daughter of Duke [[Frederick II, Duke of Upper Lorraine|Frederick II]] of the House of Ardennes, who had inherited the [[Counts and dukes of Bar|counties of Bar]] and [[Montb\u00e9liard]], had a husband named [[Louis, Count of Montb\u00e9liard|Louis]], who contested the succession.  In order to receive the support of his brother, Theodoric gave his brother the [[Count of Vaud\u00e9mont|County of Vaud\u00e9mont]] and convened an assembly of nobles, who elected him duke over Louis.  Soon Louis was dead, but his son, [[Theodoric II of Bar]], claimed the succession anyway.  However, [[Emperor Henry IV]] confirmed Theodoric the Valiant in the duchy. Probably, for this reason, Theodoric remained faithful to the emperors throughout his rule.  He fought the [[Saxons]] while they were at war with the Emperor between 1070 and 1078 and he generally opposed the [[popes]] [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] and [[Pope Urban II|Urban II]] when they were in conflict with the Emperor.\n\nIn 1095, he planned to take up the [[Cross]] (i.e., go on [[Crusade]], specifically the [[First Crusade|First]]), but his ill health provoked him to drop out, nevertheless convincing his barons to go east.  Thereafter, he took little part in imperial affairs, preferring not to intervene between Henry IV and his son [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], or against [[Lothair of Supplinburg]], [[duke of Saxony]].\n\n==Marriage and children==\nHis first wife was [[Hedwig of Formbach|Hedwig]] (died 1085 or 1090),{{sfn|Bogdan|2007|p=34}} daughter of Frederick, count of [[Formbach]]. They married around 1075 and had the following issue:\n* [[Simon I, Duke of Lorraine|Simon]] (1076 \u2013 1138), his successor as [[Duke of Lorraine]], married to [[Adelaide of Leuven]] (d. 1158),{{sfn|Bogdan|2007|p=34-35}} daughter of his stepmother [[Gertrude of Flanders, Duchess of Lorraine|Gertrude]] and [[Henry III, Count of Leuven]]. \n* [[Petronilla of Lorraine|Gertrude]] (died 1144), married [[Floris II, Count of Holland|Floris II of Holland]]\n\nHis second wife was [[Gertrude of Flanders, Duchess of Lorraine|Gertrude of Flanders]] (1080\u20131117),{{sfn|Bogdan|2007|p=42}} daughter of [[Robert I, Count of Flanders|Robert I of Flanders]] and [[Gertrude of Saxony]].

He is sometimes numbered ''Theodoric I'' if the Dukes of the House of [[Ardennes]], who ruled in [[Upper Lorraine]] from 959 to 1033, are ignored in favour of the [[Duke of Lower Lorraine|dukes of Lower Lorraine]] as predecessors of the later Dukes of Lorraine.\n\nIn fact, [[Sophie, Countess of Bar|Sophia]], the daughter of Duke [[Frederick II, Duke of Upper Lorraine|Frederick II]] of the House of Ardennes, who had inherited the [[Counts and dukes of Bar|counties of Bar]] and [[Montb\u00e9liard]], had a husband named [[Louis, Count of Montb\u00e9liard|Louis]], who contested the succession.  In order to receive the support of his brother, Theodoric gave his brother the [[Count of Vaud\u00e9mont|County of Vaud\u00e9mont]] and convened an assembly of nobles, who elected him duke over Louis.  Soon Louis was dead, but his son, [[Theodoric II of Bar]], claimed the succession anyway.  However, [[Emperor Henry IV]] confirmed Theodoric the Valiant in the duchy. Probably, for this reason, Theodoric remained faithful to the emperors throughout his rule.  He fought the [[Saxons]] while they were at war with the Emperor between 1070 and 1078 and he generally opposed the [[popes]] [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] and [[Pope Urban II|Urban II]] when they were in conflict with the Emperor.\n\nIn 1095, he planned to take up the [[Cross]] (i.e., go on [[Crusade]], specifically the [[First Crusade|First]]), but his ill health provoked him to drop out, nevertheless convincing his barons to go east.  Thereafter, he took little part in imperial affairs, preferring not to intervene between Henry IV and his son [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], or against [[Lothair of Supplinburg]], [[duke of Saxony]].\n\n==Marriage and children==\nHis first wife was [[Hedwig of Formbach|Hedwig]] (died 1085 or 1090),{{sfn|Bogdan|2007|p=34}} daughter of Frederick, count of [[Formbach]]. They married around 1075 and had the following issue:\n* [[Simon I, Duke of Lorraine|Simon]] (1076 \u2013 1138), his successor as [[Duke of Lorraine]], married to [[Adelaide of Leuven]] (d. 1158),{{sfn|Bogdan|2007|p=34-35}} daughter of his stepmother [[Gertrude of Flanders, Duchess of Lorraine|Gertrude]] and [[Henry III, Count of Leuven]]. \n* [[Petronilla of Lorraine|Gertrude]] (died 1144), married [[Floris II, Count of Holland|Floris II of Holland]]\n\nHis second wife was [[Gertrude of Flanders, Duchess of Lorraine|Gertrude of Flanders]] (1080\u20131117),{{sfn|Bogdan|2007|p=42}} daughter of [[Robert I, Count of Flanders|Robert I of Flanders]] and [[Gertrude of Saxony]].

{"title_page": "Accounts receivable", "text_new": "{{short description|Claims for payment held by a business}}\n{{Accounting}}\n'''[https://www.m1xchange.com/financiers.php Accounts receivable]''' are legally enforceable claims for payment held by a business for goods supplied and/or services rendered that customers/clients have ordered but not paid for. These are generally in the form of [[invoices]] raised by a business and delivered to the customer for payment within an agreed time frame. Accounts receivable is shown in a [[balance sheet]] as an [[asset]]. It is one of a series of [[accounting]] transactions dealing with the billing of a [[customer]] for [[good (economics)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] that the customer has ordered. These may be distinguished from [[notes receivable]], which are [[debt]]s created through formal [[legal instrument]]s called [[promissory note]]s.<ref>Belverd E. Needles, Marian Powers, Susan V. Crosson. (2010) ''Financial and Managerial Accounting'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=xI8pEZIob9UC&pg=PA373&dq p. 373].</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\n\nAccounts receivable represents money owed by entities to the firm on the sale of products or services on credit. In most business entities, accounts receivable is typically executed by generating an [[invoice]] and either mailing or [[Electronic billing|electronically]] delivering it to the customer, who, in turn, must pay it within an established timeframe, called ''credit terms''{{cn|date=February 2019}} or ''payment terms''.\n\n*The sales a business has made.\n*The amount of money received for goods or services.\n*The amount of money owed at the end of each month varies (debtors).\n\nThe accounts receivable team is in charge of receiving funds on behalf of a company and applying it towards their current pending balances.\n\nCollections and cashiering teams are part of the accounts receivable department.\nWhile the collections department seeks the debtor, the cashiering team applies the monies received.\n\n== Payment terms ==\nAn example of a common payment term is [[Net 30 days]], which means that payment is due at the end of 30 days from the date of invoice. The [[debtor]] is free to pay before the due date; businesses can offer a [[Discounts and allowances|discount]] for early payment. Other common payment terms include Net 45, Net 60 and 30 days end of month. The creditor may be able to charge late fees or interest if the amount is not paid by the due date.\n\nIn practice, the terms are often shown as two fractions, with the discount and the discount period comprising the first fraction and the letter 'n' and the payment due period comprising the second fraction.  For instance, if a company makes a purchase and will receive a 2% discount for paying within 10 days, while the whole payment is due within 30 days, the terms would be shown as 2/10, n/30.\n\nBooking a receivable is accomplished by a simple accounting transaction; however, the process of maintaining and collecting payments on the accounts receivable subsidiary account balances can be a full-time proposition. Depending on the industry in practice, accounts receivable payments can be received up to 10 \u2013 15 days after the due date has been reached. These types of payment practices are sometimes developed by industry standards, corporate policy, or because of the financial condition of the client.\n\nSince not all customer debts will be collected, businesses typically estimate the amount of and then record an [[allowance for bad debts|allowance for doubtful accounts]]<ref>http://www.accountingtools.com/allowance-for-doubtful-account</ref> which appears on the balance sheet as a [[contra account]] that offsets total accounts receivable. When accounts receivable are not paid, some companies turn them over to third party [[Collection agency|collection agencies]] or [[Creditor's rights|collection attorneys]] who will attempt to recover the debt via negotiating payment plans, settlement offers or pursuing other legal action.\n\nOutstanding advances are part of accounts receivable if a company gets an order from its customers with payment terms agreed upon in advance. Since billing is done to claim the advances several times, this area of collectible is not reflected in accounts receivables. Ideally, since advance payment occurs within a mutually agreed-upon term, it is the responsibility of the accounts department to periodically take out the statement showing advance collectible and should be provided to sales & marketing for collection of advances. The payment of accounts receivable can be protected either by a [[letter of credit]] or by [[Trade Credit Insurance]].\n\n== Accounts Receivable Age Analysis ==\nAn Accountants Receivable Age Analysis, also known as the Debtors Book is divided in categories for current, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days or longer. The analysis or report is commonly known as an Aged Trial Balance. Customers are typically listed in alphabetic order or by the amount outstanding, or according to the company chart of accounts. Zero balances are not usually shown.\n\n== Bookkeeping ==\nOn a company's [[balance sheet]], accounts receivable are the money owed to that company by entities outside of the company. Account receivables are classified as [[current asset]]s assuming that they are due within one [[calendar year]] or [[fiscal year]]. To record a journal entry for a sale on account, one must [[debit]] a receivable and [[Credit (accounting)|credit]] a revenue account. When the customer pays off their accounts, one debits cash and credits the receivable in the journal entry. The ending balance on the [[trial balance]] sheet for accounts receivable is usually a debit.\n\nBusiness organizations which have become too large to perform such tasks by hand (or small ones that could but prefer not to do them by hand) will generally use [[accounting software]] on a [[computer]] to perform this task.\n\nCompanies have two methods available to them for measuring the net value of accounts receivable, which is generally computed by subtracting the balance of an allowance account from the accounts receivable account.\n\nThe first method is the '''allowance method''', which establishes a contra-asset account, ''allowance for doubtful accounts'', or ''bad debt provision'', that has the effect of reducing the balance for accounts receivable. The amount of the [[bad debt]] provision can be computed in two ways,  either (1) by reviewing each individual debt and deciding whether it is doubtful (a specific provision); or (2) by providing for a fixed percentage (e.g. 2%) of total debtors (a general provision). The change in the bad debt provision from year to year is posted to the bad debt expense account in the [[income statement]].\n\nThe allowance method can be calculated using either the income statement method, which is based upon a percentage of net credit sales; the balance sheet approach, which is based upon an aging schedule in which debts of a certain age are classified by risk, or a combination of both.\n\nThe second method is the ''direct write-off method''. It is simpler than the allowance method in that it allows for one simple entry to reduce accounts receivable to its net realizable value. The entry would consist of debiting a bad debt expense account and crediting the respective accounts receivable in the sales ledger.  The direct write-off method is not permissible under [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]].\n\nThe two methods are not mutually exclusive, and some businesses will have a provision for doubtful debts, writing off specific debts that they know to be bad (for example, if the debtor has gone into [[liquidation]].)\n\n== Special uses ==\nCompanies can use their accounts receivable as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]] when obtaining a [[loan]] ([[asset-based lending]]). They may also sell them through [[factoring (finance)|factoring]] or on an [[Exchange (organized market)|exchange]]. Pools or portfolios of accounts receivable can be sold in [[capital markets]] through [[securitization]].\n\nFor tax reporting purposes, a general provision for bad debts is not an allowable deduction from profit<ref>{{cite web|last=HM Revenue & Customs |title=Company Taxation Manual |url=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/ctm55710.htm |accessdate=2008-11-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418073621/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/ctm55710.htm |archivedate=2009-04-18 }}</ref> - a business can only get relief for specific debtors that have gone bad.

Bonville's father died before Bonville reached adulthood. As a result, he grew up in the household of his grandfather and namesake, who was a prominent member of the Devon gentry. Both Bonville's father and grandfather had been successful in politics and land acquisition, and when Bonville came of age, he gained control of a large estate. He augmented this further by a series of lawsuits against his stepfather, [[Richard Stucley]]. Bonville undertook royal service, which then meant fighting in France in the later years of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. In 1415, he joined the [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u20131453)|English invasion of France]] in the retinue of [[Thomas, Duke of Clarence]], [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]'s brother, and fought in the [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt campaign]]. Throughout his life, Bonville was despatched on further operations in France, but increasingly events in the southwest of England took up more of his time and energy, as he became [[Bonville\u2013Courtenay feud|involved in a feud]] with his powerful neighbour [[Thomas de Courtenay, 5th Earl of Devon|Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon]].\n\nBraised Nancy Pelosi\n\nIn 1437, King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] granted Bonville the profitable office of steward of the [[Duchy of Cornwall]]. This had traditionally been a hereditary office of the earls of Devon, and the Earl was enraged at its loss. The dispute soon descended into violence, and Bonville and Courtenay ravaged each other's properties. The situation was exacerbated in 1442 when the Crown appointed Courtenay to effectively the same stewardship it had appointed Bonville, which inflamed the situation even more.

Stucley based his claim on the tradition of [[Courtesy of England|courtesy]]. On reaching his legal majority, Bonville sued his stepfather for his maternal inheritance. This struggle took over six years, but he succeeded in establishing his rights to the estates by 1422. Bonville's grandmother survived until 1426; by then Bonville had also inherited substantial estates from other relatives, including a cousin and an aunt. These brought him the manors of [[Yelverton, Devon|Yelverton]] and [[Mudford Sock]], and as a result, says the ''[[History of Parliament]]'', \"without doubt Bonville ranked among the very wealthiest landowners of the West Country\".{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\n\n== Political career and royal service ==\n[[File:Taunton Castle 03.jpg|upright=1.2|alt=Taunton Castle in 2017|thumb|The main gate, in 2017, of Bonville's castle at Taunton, which was besieged by the Earl of Devon|left]]\nBonville undertook [[Hundred Years' War|royal service in France]] in 1415, and joined Henry V's [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt campaign]], travelling in the [[retinue]] of the King's brother, [[Thomas, Duke of Clarence]].

During his absence, Courtenay had become increasingly powerful in Devon. The King, though, was revealing himself to be a weak-willed monarch, unwilling\u2014or unable\u2014to impose the [[Peace (law)|King's peace]] in the southwest, or, for that matter, elsewhere. Henry was under the influence of his [[favourite]], [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk|William de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk]],{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} and Suffolk's government could not afford to alienate the Earl of Devon. Conversely, Suffolk was still an attractive ally for Bonville against the Earl,{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=576}} as Bonville's Lincolnshire associate{{sfn|Virgoe|1997|p=291}} and later son-in-law, Tailboys, was closely linked with Suffolk.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}}{{Refn|William Tailboys has been described by the historian [[Roger Virgoe]] as \"exceptionally violent and unscrupulous even for that age\".

In 1444 Bonville joined the duke's retinue to France, where Bonville played a central role in the [[Betrothal|betrothal ceremony]] between King Henry and his bride-to-be, [[Margaret of Anjou]]. By a [[writ]] of 10 March the following year{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=353}} Bonville was elevated to the peerage.{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} This was both in recognition of his successes in France{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=576}}\u2014it had been a \"turbulent period\" in Gascony{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=356}}\u2014but also a reflection of the esteem Suffolk held him in.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=576}} As Baron Bonville of Chewton; he was summoned to every parliament until the end of his life as ''Willelmo Bonville domino Bonville et de Chuton''.{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} In 1446 Bonville suppressed a revolt in Somerset, in which [[Wells Cathedral]] was attacked by \"insurgents against the peace of the Church and the King\".{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\n\nBonville's association with Suffolk was not to last. In early 1450, the duke was [[Impeachment|impeached in the]] House of Lords and [[exile]]d as a result. Suffolk was subsequently murdered ''en route'' to the continent. Roskell notes that, although Bonville is known to have attended this parliament, it remains unknown what position he took\u2014if he took any\u2014on Suffolk's impeachment.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=154}} One of the most powerful critics of Suffolk's government had been [[Richard, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]], and the Earl of Devon soon allied himself with the duke as a means of furthering his position in the [[West Country]]. Courtenay saw his newly-reinforced position as sufficiently secure to allow him to reignite the feud with Bonville,{{Sfn|Radford|1912|p=254}} who in Taunton was recruiting men to his banner at [[Sixpence (British coin)|sixpence]] a day.{{Sfn|Hicks|1998|p=93}} To this end he launched a series of raids onto Bonville properties, which culminated in Courtenay's [[Besiege|besieging]] of Bonville's [[Taunton Castle]]{{Sfn|Radford|1912|p=254}} with a force of over 5,000 men{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=576}}\u2014a crisis that the contemporary [[chronicle]]r [[William Worcester]] described as \"''maxima perturbatio''\".{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=154}}{{Refn|Translated to English, Worcester described it as \"the greatest disturbance\".{{sfn|Roskell|1954|p=154}}|group=note}} Fighting alongside Courtenay was [[Edward Brooke, 6th Baron Cobham|Edward Brooke, Lord Cobham]], son of the Thomas Brooke whom Bonville had feuded with over a decade previously.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Courtenay's alliance with York was not as strong as the Earl believed, and when York arrived in Devon to restore order, he promptly cast both Bonville and Courtenay, with many of their retainers, into prison{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} for a month.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=692}} Bonville was forced to put Taunton Castle into the duke's custody.{{Sfn|Gillingham|1993|p=72}} This particular phase of the feud was suspended by the holding of a [[Loveday (arbitration)|loveday]] (''dies amoris'') between Bonville and Courtenay at [[Colcombe Castle|Colcombe]] in 1451. This was an important enough political event for it to warrant the attendance of [[Richard Woodville, 1st Earl Rivers|Richard, Lord Rivers]] and his wife [[Jacquetta of Luxembourg|Jacquetta, Lady Rivers]] as the King's representatives.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=596}}\n\nThe Earl of Devon's continuing alliance with York brought Courtenay further problems in 1452. By then, York felt excluded from the government as the King had a new favourite, [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Edmund, Duke of Somerset]]. In February that year York rebelled and marched on London with a large force. He faced the King's army at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]], southeast of London. Courtenay stood alongside him. Somerset and much of the rest of the nobility faced York and Courtenay down: they surrendered without a fight.{{Sfn|Radford|1912|p=255}} Bonville had raised a body of men to join the King's army,{{Sfn|Goodman|1981|p=20}} and subsequently profited from Courtenay's disfavour with the King.{{sfn|Carpenter|1997|p=128}} The historian [[A. J. Pollard]] suggests that Bonville was given \"a free hand\" in the region as a result of York's and Devon's eclipse{{Sfn|Pollard|2000|p=136}} and according to Cherry, this allowed Bonville to become the predominant figure in county politics.{{Sfn|Cherry|1981b|p=132}} He was commissioned to oversee the arrest and prosecution of the Earl of Devon's men after Blackheath, and the following year King Henry demonstrated the esteem Bonville stood in when, during Henry's [[royal progress]] through the southwest, he stayed at Bonville's [[Caput baroniae|''caput'']] of Shute.{{Sfn|Wolffe|1981|p=259}} Bonville received further offices and responsibilities. He was confirmed as steward of the Duchy of Cornwall, reappointed seneschal of Gascony and also made [[lieutenant of Aquitaine]]). Bonville has been described by historians connected to ''The [[Gascon Rolls]] Project'' as being \"an excellent choice for lieutenant\"{{sfn|Gascon Rolls|2014}}{{refn|The office of lieutenant of Aquitaine went back to at least 1278,{{sfn|Gascon Rolls|2014}} and since the [[Duke of Aquitaine]] was also King of England, the lieutenant ruled directly on the King's behalf. It was a royal appointment, usually to a close relative of the King, although it was a sporadic one, being mostly filled during periods of war or civil disturbance.{{sfn|Gribit|2016|p=13}} It was not a particularly profitable office, notes the economist [[Michael Postan]], and indeed was \"as likely to be a source of loss as gain\" for the appointee, and the King was regularly forced to provide financial inducements to those he wished to take up the post.{{sfn|Postan|1973|p=74}}|group=note}} and received the constableship of [[Exeter Castle]].{{Sfn|Storey|1999|p=165}} He also received grants of lands and estates in [[South Teign River|South Teign]], the [[Lydford Castle|castle]], borough and [[manor]] of Lydford, the [[conservancy]] of the [[River Exe]], and [[forestry rights]] in [[Dartmoor]],{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=154}} making him, wrote the historian [[Bertram Wolffe]], \"exalted in the west country\".{{Sfn|Wolffe|1981|p=262}} Bonville never took up his seneschalcy as what remained of England's territorial possessions in France were lost at the [[Battle of Castillon]] in July 1453.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} King Henry\u2014now in Exeter\u2014appointed Bonville to a large commission of [[oyer and terminer]] to investigate sympathy for York's rebellion in the area, and the King made him a gift of \u00a350.{{Sfn|Wolffe|1981|pp=259\u2013260}}\n\n=== Henry's illness and Yorkist government ===\n[[File:MapBattleOfClystHeath1455.PNG|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=map showing location of the Clyst battlefield in Devon|Map of the location of the Clyst engagement, 1455]]In August 1453, King Henry suffered a period of illness and mental collapse during which he was unable to respond to people or stimulus. He was, therefore, unable to carry out his royal duties. The Lancastrian regime, already weakened by factionalism, was paralysed,{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=715}} and the national political scene became increasingly tense. Bonville attended a council at Westminster in early 1454. This, a [[Paston Letters|Paston]] correspondent reported, was only after he had \"maken all the puissance they can and may to come hider [to Westminster] with theym\".{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=723}} It was rumoured that Bonville was planning to join up with other lords\u2014those of Beaumont, Poynings, Clifford and Egremont\u2014and march on London itself, although in the event this did not occur.{{Sfn|Jacob|1993|p=508}}{{Refn|In other words, it was rumoured that Bonville ordered the gathering of the largest force of men (a ''puissaunce''{{sfn|MED|2014a}}) that he could, and that having done so, he brought them (''hider''{{sfn|MED|2014b}}) to Westminster with him; from a letter of 19 January 1454 from John Studley to John Paston.{{sfn|Gairdner|1986|p=299}}|group=note}} Everyone, including Bonville, was preparing for war on a national scale.{{Sfn|Tuck|1999|p=271}}\n\nThe [[House of Lords]] eventually appointed the Duke of York as [[Lord Protector|protector]] of the realm during the King's incapacitation, and York appointed Salisbury [[Lord Chancellor|chancellor]]. Although Courtenay was nominally York's ally, the Earl did not see any major benefits from this relationship. (York's other allies, argues John Watts, the Nevilles, received York's assistance in their on-going feud with the Percies in Yorkshire.) Bonville experienced no lessening of his position during the protectorate;{{Sfn|Watts|1996|pp=324 + n.274, 338 n.328}} indeed, he had committed flagrant acts of piracy against foreign shipping off the southwest coast, which went unpunished. The most prominent victims of Bonville's actions were the Duke of Burgundy's merchants; Burgundy was England's ally on the continent, a position which Bonville's ships endangered.{{Sfn|Johnson|1988|p=151}}\n\n=== Battle of St Albans and Bonville's ascendency ===\nIn early 1455 King Henry made a sudden recovery. York and Salisbury were removed from their positions in government and retired to their estates. National politics, already heavily partisan, was tense. The King summoned a great council to be held in Leicester in May. Several chroniclers of the day suggest that Somerset was poisoning the King's mind against York.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=740}} He and the Nevilles may have feared imminent arrest. In any case, they reacted swiftly and with violence. They ambushed the King's small army at the [[First Battle of St Albans]] on the 22nd in a [[pre-emptive strike]]. Courtenay fought for the King and was wounded.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=155}} Bonville may also have been sympathetic to the royal cause, as one of his [[pursuivant]]s was used as a messenger by the King's councillors. He did not join the royal army, however.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Michael Hicks has suggested that both Bonville and Courtenay were more interested in prosecuting their own feud than the national one.{{Sfn|Hicks|1998|p=94}} King Henry had been captured by the Yorkists after the battle: once again they controlled the government.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Although clearly unwilling to turn against his King at this point,{{Sfn|Grummitt|2013|p=59}} Bonville did attend the Yorkist parliament of September 1455, where he voted in favour of the Duke of York's appointment as protector.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1984|p=78}} Bonville was appointed to the parliamentary committee set up to improve naval defence.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} He also used his local influence to ensure that the vacant [[Bishop of Exeter|Bishopric of Exeter]] was reserved for the Earl of Salisbury's youngest son, [[George Neville (Archbishop)|George Neville]],{{Sfn|Pollard|2000|p=149}} and in November Bonville received a general [[Royal pardon|pardon]].{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=770 n.202}}\n\nIn the southwest, Bonville and his ally, [[James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond|James Butler, Earl of Wiltshire]] (also at this time very close to the court) were recruiting heavily.{{Sfn|Grummitt|2013|p=36}} They caused a proclamation \"to be cryed at Taunton in Somersetshire that every man that is likely and wole go with theym and serve theym shalle have ''vjd.'' [sixpence] every day as long as he abideth with theym\".{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Bonville's dominance in the southwest forced the Earl of Devon to respond drastically,{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=166}} and at the end of April 1454 Devon brought an armed force of hundreds of men into Exeter in a planned [[ambush]]. The plan failed, but Bonville was prevented from carrying out his duty as a collector of a royal loan.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Although in the following June both Bonville and Courtenay were instructed by the King to keep the peace\u2014and each bound over for \u00a34,000 to do so\u2014they appear to have continued their war of attrition. Such was the \"anarchic state of affairs\"{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} in Devon following St Albans that the [[Michaelmas term]] judicial sessions that were due to be held in Exeter had to be cancelled. Courtenay went on to terrorise the county with his army and ransacked Bonville's houses.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} This culminated on 23 October 1455 with what has been described as the \"most notorious private crime of the century\",{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=167}} when Courtenay's son\u2014also [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th/14th Earl of Devon|Thomas]]\u2014and a small force of men attacked and brutally murdered one of Bonville's close councillors, the prominent local lawyer [[Nicholas Radford]].{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=168}} Carpenter comments: \"there were other enormities, principally directed against Lord Bonville.

Bonville\u2014along with [[Sir Thomas Kyriell]]\u2014was placed in charge of the King,{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=155}} whom the Yorkists had brought with them as the (\"nominal\", said the early 20th-century historian C. L. Scofield) head of their army.{{Sfn|Scofield|1923|p=140}} They were responsible for Henry's protection during the battle.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=155}} This, suggests Ross, may indicate that even at this late stage Bonville was still primarily motivated by a wish to protect the King he had served since youth.{{Sfn|Ross|1994|p=142}} Warwick's force was rapidly isolated by the swift-moving Lancastrian army, and Warwick fled, leaving the field\u2014and King\u2014to the victorious Lancastrians.{{Sfn|Hicks|1998|p=216}} Bonville and Kyriell were also captured. The following day they were summoned before the Queen and Prince Edward, and it is possible that both had been promised a pardon by the King.{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}}{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=155}} However, in the presence of the Earl of Devon\u2014and probably at his instigation\u2014the two were tried for treason.{{sfn|Cherry|1981b|pp=138\u2013139}} The result was a foregone conclusion.{{sfn|Storey|1999|pp=174\u2013175}} Prince Edward \"was jugge ys own selfe\", and sentenced them to death.{{Sfn|Lewis|2013|p=240}} Both men were [[Decapitation|beheaded]] the same day;{{sfn|Storey|1999|pp=174\u2013175}}{{refn|Recent scholarship has cast an element of doubt on this story, as it would dovetail neatly into the Yorkist narrative as propaganda. As has been said, \"both Bonville and Kyriel were experienced military commanders, and it is unlikely that their role in the battle would have been limited to looking after King Henry\".{{sfn|Burley|Elliott|Watson|2007|p=79}} The story presented by the (Yorkist) chroniclers was that the Prince of Wales, encouraged by Queen Margaret, personally passed Bonville's and Kyriel's death sentences. Supposedly she asked him, \"Fair son, what manner of death shall these knights, whom you see here, die?\", to which the Prince replied, \"Let them have their heads taken off\". To the Prince, Kyriel is said to have retorted, \"May God destroy those who have taught thee this manner of speech!\"{{sfn|Burley|Elliott|Watson|2007|p=79}}{{pb}}This stage of the civil wars saw frequent post-battlefield beheadings by the victor. Two months previously, captured Yorkists (including the Earl of Salisbury) had been executed after Wakefield; earlier in February, Lancastrians were killed after the [[Battle of Mortimer's Cross]], including [[Owen Tudor]]; Bonville and Kyriel two weeks later at St Albans;{{sfn|Boardman|1998|p=55}}   and two months later, in April 1461, the Earl of Devon (\"who was sick in York and could not get away\", commented [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]]).{{sfn|Haigh|2002|p=92}} Over 40 other knights and nobles were beheaded by the victorious Yorkists after the Battle of Towton.{{sfn|Haigh|2002|p=92}}|group=note}} the executions were met with what the historian [[David Grummitt]] has described as the \"general condemnation\" of contemporaries.{{Sfn|Grummitt|2013|p=76}} Bonville's death extinguished the male line of the Bonville family of Chute,{{sfn|Kleineke|2015|p=122}}{{refn|Other cadet branches of the family remained; for example at [[Dillington]], where Lord Bonville's cousin John Bonville resided and made a family.{{sfn|Kleineke|2015|p=122}} This John was the grandson of William, Lord Bonville's paternal uncle, Thomas.{{sfn|Wedgwood|Holt|1936|p=92}}|group=note}} and, says Pollard, settled the Bonville-Courtenay \"blood feud\" for good.{{Sfn|Pollard|2001|p=39}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\nBonville's household was almost immediately dissolved, although some of his staff remained with his widow. He had left no [[Will and testament|will]] when he died.{{sfn|Kleineke|2015|p=121}} His estates and wealth were effectively divided three ways: between his widow; his brother; and his illegitimate son.{{sfn|Kleineke|2015|p=123}} As both Bonville's legitimate sons had predeceased him, his estates and titles passed to his one-year-old{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} great-granddaughter [[Cecily Bonville, 7th Baroness Harington|Cecily]] ''[[suo jure]]''.{{Sfn|Rosenthal|1996|p=86}} She later married [[Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset|Thomas Grey, Marquess of Dorset]].{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=219}} A portion of the patrimony had been [[entail]]ed in the [[male line]] by Bonville's grandfather, and these lands descended to his younger brother, Thomas, and then Thomas' son.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Much of Bonville's retinue entered the employment of [[Humphrey Stafford, 1st Earl of Devon|Humphrey Stafford]] and Bonville's old ally Sir Philip Courtenay of [[Powderham]].{{sfn|Kleineke|2015|pp=124\u2013125}} Bonville's and Courtenay's deaths prolonged the power vacuum in Devon, and, says the historian [[Malcolm Mercer (historian)|Malcolm Mercer]], \"a dominant source of authority in the area remained elusive thereafter\".{{Sfn|Mercer|2010|p=13}}\n\nAlthough executed for treason, Bonville escaped [[attainder]] due to the victory a few weeks later of [[Edward IV of England|Edward of York]]\u2014son of Richard of York\u2014at the [[Battle of Towton]] in April 1461. The Lancastrian army was destroyed: Queen Margaret escaped to Scotland, Henry went on the run in the [[Northern England|north]], and Edward claimed the throne as King Edward IV. Following the battle, the Earl of Devon was captured and beheaded at [[York]].{{sfn|Cherry||1981b|p=138}}{{Refn|Apart from the Bonville and Courtenay families, [[K. B.

Bonville's father died before Bonville reached adulthood. As a result, he grew up in the household of his grandfather and namesake, who was a prominent member of the Devon gentry. Both Bonville's father and grandfather had been successful in politics and land acquisition, and when Bonville came of age, he gained control of a large estate. He augmented this further by a series of lawsuits against his stepfather, [[Richard Stucley]]. Bonville undertook royal service, which then meant fighting in France in the later years of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. In 1415, he joined the [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u20131453)|English invasion of France]] in the retinue of [[Thomas, Duke of Clarence]], [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]'s brother, and fought in the [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt campaign]]. Throughout his life, Bonville was despatched on further operations in France, but increasingly events in the southwest of England took up more of his time and energy, as he became [[Bonville\u2013Courtenay feud|involved in a feud]] with his powerful neighbour [[Thomas de Courtenay, 5th Earl of Devon|Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon]].\n\nIn 1437, King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] granted Bonville the profitable office of steward of the [[Duchy of Cornwall]]. This had traditionally been a hereditary office of the earls of Devon, and the Earl was enraged at its loss. The dispute soon descended into violence, and Bonville and Courtenay ravaged each other's properties. The situation was exacerbated in 1442 when the Crown appointed Courtenay to effectively the same stewardship it had appointed Bonville, which inflamed the situation even more. The feud between them continued intermittently for the next decade. Generally, Henry and his government failed to intervene between the two parties; when it did, its efforts were ineffectual. On one occasion Bonville was persuaded to undertake further service in France\u2014primarily to get Bonville out of the region\u2014but the mission was poorly funded, a military failure, and when Bonville returned the feud reignited. In 1453, King Henry became ill and entered a [[catatonic state]] for eighteen months, heightening the political factionalism that had riven the reign.\n\nBonville generally seems to have remained loyal to the king, although his guiding motivation was to support whoever would aid him in his struggle against Courtenay. Their feud was part of a broader breakdown in law and order which eventually evolved into the [[Wars of the Roses]] in 1455. Bonville seems to have managed to avoid implication in the variable swings in political fortune which followed until 1460. At this point, he threw in his lot with the rebellious [[Richard, Duke of York]]. His new allegiance brought him little profit; his son was killed alongside York at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] in December 1460, while Bonville himself took part in the [[Second Battle of St Albans]] two months later on the losing side; with [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th Earl of Devon|the new Earl of Devon]] watching, he was [[Decapitation|beheaded]] on 18 February 1461.\n\n== Background and early life ==\nThe Bonvilles were one of the major [[gentry]] families of late-fourteenth-century Devon, often working in close co-operation with their neighbours. The most important of these were the [[House of Courtenay|Courtenay]] [[Earl of Devon|earls of Devon]]. Bonville's grandfather had been a [[Retainer (medieval)|retainer]] of the 11th Earl, [[Edward de Courtenay, 3rd/11th Earl of Devon|Edward]]. The historian [[Christine Carpenter (historian)|Christine Carpenter]] comments, on the family's social position, that they were of sufficiently \"landed and official status to be regarded as what might be termed 'super-knights'{{tsp}}\";{{Sfn|Carpenter|2012|p=76}} she echoed the medievalist [[K. B. McFarlane]], who had previously described the family as \"a powerful and respected element in Devon...there was no need for them to stand in dread of the great, for they were not small themselves\".{{Sfn|McFarlane|1981|p=16}}\n[[File:OldShuteHouseGreatHallFromWest.jpg|upright=1.2|alt=Late fourteenth-century section of Bonville's birthplace.|left|thumb|Very little of the original medieval manor house remains of Bonville's birthplace; the section shown here is from the late fourteenth century.]]\nWilliam Bonville was born on either 12 or 31 August 1392{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} or 1393 in [[Shute, Devon]], to John Bonville (d. 1396) and Elizabeth Fitzroger (c. 1370\u2013c. 1414).{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} William Bonville's grandfather was his namesake Sir William Bonville, who had been [[member of Parliament]] for [[Somerset]] and Devon on multiple occasions{{Sfn|Roskell|Clark|Rawcliffe|1993a}} and has been described by a historian as one of \"the most prominent west-country gentry in the late fourteenth century\".{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} On hearing of the birth of his grandson, a contemporary reports, Sir William \"raised his hands to heaven and praised God\".{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Along with the [[Newenham Abbey|Abbot of Newenham]], he stood [[godparent]] to the young William.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} The younger William was heir to both his father and grandfather; the latter\u2014who had married twice\u2014had substantially expanded the family [[Inheritance|patrimony]].{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} He has been described by the scholar [[Ralph A. Griffiths|Ralph Griffiths]] as a \"capable, energetic and well-connected man\".{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=574}}\n\nBonville's father died when his son was four,{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} and young William probably grew up in his grandfather's household.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Grandfather Bonville died in 1408,{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} while Bonville was still legally a [[Minor (law)|minor]].{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} As was customary, [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]] took both Bonville's [[Ward (law)|wardship]] and marriage into his own hands. This was valuable [[Royal Patronage|royal patronage]],{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}} which the King granted firstly to Sir [[John Tiptoft, 1st Baron Tiptoft|John Tiptoft]],{{Sfn|Roskell|1983|p=111}} and then to [[Edward, Duke of York]].{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} Bonville had a younger brother, Thomas, who, by the time William came of age, had already married a cousin of [[Robert Poynings|Robert, Baron Poynings]]. This connection to the Poynings family, the historian [[J. S. Roskell]] has suggested, was instrumental in Bonville's own marriage.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}}\n\n=== Marriages and children ===\nBonville married twice. In 1414 he married Margaret Grey, daughter of [[Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn|Reginald, Baron Grey of Ruthin]].{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=574}} Lord Grey promised to pay 200 marks{{Refn|A medieval English mark was an [[Unit of account|accounting unit]] equivalent to two-thirds of a pound.{{sfn|Harding|2002|p=xiv}}|group=note}} to Bonville on the wedding day, and Bonville likewise contracted to settle estates to the value of \u00a3100 on himself and his wife, [[Jointure|jointly]]. Grey also paid another 200 marks in instalments over the following four years.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Sometime between April 1426 and October 1427{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}}\u2014when Bonville received a [[papal dispensation]] to marry again\u2014Margaret Grey died. Bonville made his next marriage to Elizabeth Courtenay, widow of [[John Harington, 4th Baron Harington|John, Baron Harington]]. Elizabeth was the daughter of Bonville's grandfather's local associate, Edward Earl of Devon.{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|pp=218\u2013219}} The couple required a dispensation to marry because Elizabeth was already a godmother to one of Bonville's daughters; in the eyes of the church, this placed her within a prohibited degree of [[consanguinity]].{{sfn|Attreed|2001|p=128}} Elizabeth was already well connected\u2014her brother-in-law was Lord Harington, and the Earl of Devon her nephew{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\u2014and this marriage greatly increased Bonville's links to the [[Peerage of England|peerage]].\n\nBonville's son and heir by Margaret, also named [[William Bonville, 6th Baron Harington|William]], married Lord Harington's only daughter Elizabeth around 1443.{{sfn|Kleineke|2015|p=121}} Two of Bonville's daughters\u2014Margaret and Philippa{{Refn|name=\"P\"|group=note}}\u2014married William Courtenay and William Grenville respectively; they were both scions of cadet branches of the Courtenay family. Bonville's third daughter, Elizabeth,{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} married an important Midlands landowner, [[William Tailboys|Sir William Tailboys]] by November 1446.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=580}} These marriages further enhanced Bonville's aristocratic and political connections.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\n\nBonville had an illegitimate son, John, by Isabel Kirkby.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} John married Alice Denys and was [[Financial endowment|endowed]] in 1453.{{sfn|Kleineke|2015|p=122}} On Bonville's death, he bequesthed John a \"substantial\" property. He died in 1499.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} {{Location map|Devon|width=230|float=right|caption=The location of Shute, Bonville's birthplace, within Devon and England.|label=Shute|mark=Red_pog.svg|lat_deg=|lon_deg=|lat=50.7712|long=-3.0602}}\n\n=== Estates and wealth ===\nBonville's father and grandfather had both had successful careers.{{Sfn|Roskell|Clark|Rawcliffe|1993a}} As such, when Bonville [[Age of majority|came of age]] in 1414{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}} he inherited an income of approximately \u00a3900 per annum; for context, the historian [[Martin Cherry]] says this was \"a figure not far short of that enjoyed by the fifteenth-century earls of Devon themselves\".{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} His lands\u2014comprising 18 manors{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}}\u2014were situated all over England, although concentrated in Devon, particularly around Shute in the southeast of the county, and Somerset.{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} These lands encompassed his grandfather's patrimony, with manors in Devon, Somerset, Dorset and [[Wiltshire]]. The Fitzroger estates were mainly in [[Leicestershire]], the [[East Midlands]], and the southeast of England in [[Kent]] and [[Sussex]].{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\n\nOwing to the deaths of their husbands in 1396 and 1408 respectively,{{sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}} Bonville's mother and grandmother each held a third of his inheritance in [[dower]].{{Refn|The legal concept of dower had existed since the late twelfth century as a means of protecting a woman from being left landless if her husband died first. He would, when they married, assign certain estates to her\u2014a ''dos nominata'', or dower\u2014usually a third of everything he was [[seisin|seised]] of. By the fifteenth century, the widow was deemed entitled to her dower;{{sfn|Kenny|2003|pp=59\u201360}} the historian [[Rowena Archer]] argues that this made it \"one of the most destructive of baronial incidents\" on account of how a long-lived [[dowager]] could reduce an inheritance over generations.{{sfn|Archer|1984|p=16}}|group=note}} His mother had remarried in 1397, to [[Richard Stucley]],{{refn|Also spelled Styuecle.{{Sfn|Roskell|Clark|Rawcliffe|1993b}}|group=note}} an important [[Essex]] landowner. In 1410 she granted Stucley a life-interest in her inheritance, with [[remainder (law)|remainder]] to their children.{{Sfn|Roskell|Clark|Rawcliffe|1993b}} On her death in April 1414{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}} Stucley thereby gained Devon lands worth around \u00a3105 per annum{{Sfn|Roskell|Clark|Rawcliffe|1993b}} as well as Wiltshire manors of the Bonville estate, including the valuable manor of [[Chewton Mendip|Chewton]]. Stucley based his claim on the tradition of [[Courtesy of England|courtesy]]. On reaching his legal majority, Bonville sued his stepfather for his maternal inheritance. This struggle took over six years, but he succeeded in establishing his rights to the estates by 1422. Bonville's grandmother survived until 1426; by then Bonville had also inherited substantial estates from other relatives, including a cousin and an aunt. These brought him the manors of [[Yelverton, Devon|Yelverton]] and [[Mudford Sock]], and as a result, says the ''[[History of Parliament]]'', \"without doubt Bonville ranked among the very wealthiest landowners of the West Country\".{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\n\n== Political career and royal service ==\n[[File:Taunton Castle 03.jpg|upright=1.2|alt=Taunton Castle in 2017|thumb|The main gate, in 2017, of Bonville's castle at Taunton, which was besieged by the Earl of Devon|left]]\nBonville undertook [[Hundred Years' War|royal service in France]] in 1415, and joined Henry V's [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt campaign]], travelling in the [[retinue]] of the King's brother, [[Thomas, Duke of Clarence]]. While in [[Normandy]], sometime before his seventeenth birthday, Bonville was knighted.{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}}{{refn|It is unknown, however, whether Bonville fought in the Battle of Agincourt itself. The historian [[Clifford J. Rogers]] notes that the numbers known to have begun the campaign had been reduced by early losses, sickness and those otherwise invalided\nto England after the [[Siege of Harfleur]] in particular.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|p=52}}|group=note}}\n\nIn 1421, Bonville acted as one of the Duke of Clarence's [[executor]]s following the latter's death at the [[Battle of Baug\u00e9]]. Roskell suggests that Bonville must have been greatly trusted by Clarence\u2014at the time of his death, [[heir presumptive]] to the English throne\u2014because the Duke had borrowed money from Bonville.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}} Bonville had returned to England before May, when he attended parliament at [[Westminster Hall|Westminster]].{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Henry V died in France in August 1422 leaving his six-month-old son [[Henry VI of England|Henry]] as his heir, and his surviving brothers, [[John, Duke of Bedford]] and [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]] as the baby King's [[regents]].{{sfn|Matusiak|2012|pp=232\u2013233}}{{refn|Clarence had predeceased King Henry, having been killed at the [[Battle of Baug\u00e9]] the previous year.{{sfn|Matusiak|2012|p=218}}|group=note}} The war in France continued in spite of Henry VI's youth, and Bonville returned in 1423 in Gloucester's army. Bonville fought in the campaign to regain [[Le Crotoy]], bringing with him a retinue of ten [[Man-at-arms|men-at-arms]] and 30 archers.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\n\nOn his return to England, much of Bonville's time was occupied with the administration of his estates. Extensive as they were, there was occasional friction\u2014some of it violent\u2014with his neighbours.{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} In 1427 he was engaged in a bitter feud with [[Thomas Brooke (died 1439)|Sir Thomas Brooke]], whom Bonville\u2014described as a \"thrusting and able man\"{{Sfn|Wilkinson|1995|p=311}}\u2014accused of unilaterally [[Enclosure|enclosing]] parkland in [[Axmouth]] and obstructing roads that Bonville's tenants needed to use.

During his absence, Courtenay had become increasingly powerful in Devon. The King, though, was revealing himself to be a weak-willed monarch, unwilling\u2014or unable\u2014to impose the [[Peace (law)|King's peace]] in the southwest, or, for that matter, elsewhere. Henry was under the influence of his [[favourite]], [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk|William de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk]],{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} and Suffolk's government could not afford to alienate the Earl of Devon. Conversely, Suffolk was still an attractive ally for Bonville against the Earl,{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=576}} as Bonville's Lincolnshire associate{{sfn|Virgoe|1997|p=291}} and later son-in-law, Tailboys, was closely linked with Suffolk.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}}{{Refn|William Tailboys has been described by the historian [[Roger Virgoe]] as \"exceptionally violent and unscrupulous even for that age\".

In 1444 Bonville joined the duke's retinue to France, where Bonville played a central role in the [[Betrothal|betrothal ceremony]] between King Henry and his bride-to-be, [[Margaret of Anjou]]. By a [[writ]] of 10 March the following year{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=353}} Bonville was elevated to the peerage.{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} This was both in recognition of his successes in France{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=576}}\u2014it had been a \"turbulent period\" in Gascony{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=356}}\u2014but also a reflection of the esteem Suffolk held him in.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=576}} As Baron Bonville of Chewton; he was summoned to every parliament until the end of his life as ''Willelmo Bonville domino Bonville et de Chuton''.{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} In 1446 Bonville suppressed a revolt in Somerset, in which [[Wells Cathedral]] was attacked by \"insurgents against the peace of the Church and the King\".{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\n\nBonville's association with Suffolk was not to last. In early 1450, the duke was [[Impeachment|impeached in the]] House of Lords and [[exile]]d as a result. Suffolk was subsequently murdered ''en route'' to the continent.

Courtenay saw his newly-reinforced position as sufficiently secure to allow him to reignite the feud with Bonville,{{Sfn|Radford|1912|p=254}} who in Taunton was recruiting men to his banner at [[Sixpence (British coin)|sixpence]] a day.{{Sfn|Hicks|1998|p=93}} To this end he launched a series of raids onto Bonville properties, which culminated in Courtenay's [[Besiege|besieging]] of Bonville's [[Taunton Castle]]{{Sfn|Radford|1912|p=254}} with a force of over 5,000 men{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=576}}\u2014a crisis that the contemporary [[chronicle]]r [[William Worcester]] described as \"''maxima perturbatio''\".{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=154}}{{Refn|Translated to English, Worcester described it as \"the greatest disturbance\".{{sfn|Roskell|1954|p=154}}|group=note}} Fighting alongside Courtenay was [[Edward Brooke, 6th Baron Cobham|Edward Brooke, Lord Cobham]], son of the Thomas Brooke whom Bonville had feuded with over a decade previously.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Courtenay's alliance with York was not as strong as the Earl believed, and when York arrived in Devon to restore order, he promptly cast both Bonville and Courtenay, with many of their retainers, into prison{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} for a month.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=692}} Bonville was forced to put Taunton Castle into the duke's custody.{{Sfn|Gillingham|1993|p=72}} This particular phase of the feud was suspended by the holding of a [[Loveday (arbitration)|loveday]] (''dies amoris'') between Bonville and Courtenay at [[Colcombe Castle|Colcombe]] in 1451.

By then, York felt excluded from the government as the King had a new favourite, [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Edmund, Duke of Somerset]]. In February that year York rebelled and marched on London with a large force. He faced the King's army at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]], southeast of London. Courtenay stood alongside him. Somerset and much of the rest of the nobility faced York and Courtenay down: they surrendered without a fight.{{Sfn|Radford|1912|p=255}} Bonville had raised a body of men to join the King's army,{{Sfn|Goodman|1981|p=20}} and subsequently profited from Courtenay's disfavour with the King.{{sfn|Carpenter|1997|p=128}} The historian [[A.

He was, therefore, unable to carry out his royal duties. The Lancastrian regime, already weakened by factionalism, was paralysed,{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=715}} and the national political scene became increasingly tense.

Although Courtenay was nominally York's ally, the Earl did not see any major benefits from this relationship. (York's other allies, argues John Watts, the Nevilles, received York's assistance in their on-going feud with the Percies in Yorkshire.) Bonville experienced no lessening of his position during the protectorate;{{Sfn|Watts|1996|pp=324 + n.274, 338 n.328}} indeed, he had committed flagrant acts of piracy against foreign shipping off the southwest coast, which went unpunished. The most prominent victims of Bonville's actions were the Duke of Burgundy's merchants; Burgundy was England's ally on the continent, a position which Bonville's ships endangered.{{Sfn|Johnson|1988|p=151}}\n\n=== Battle of St Albans and Bonville's ascendency ===\nIn early 1455 King Henry made a sudden recovery. York and Salisbury were removed from their positions in government and retired to their estates. National politics, already heavily partisan, was tense. The King summoned a great council to be held in Leicester in May. Several chroniclers of the day suggest that Somerset was poisoning the King's mind against York.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=740}} He and the Nevilles may have feared imminent arrest. In any case, they reacted swiftly and with violence. They ambushed the King's small army at the [[First Battle of St Albans]] on the 22nd in a [[pre-emptive strike]]. Courtenay fought for the King and was wounded.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=155}} Bonville may also have been sympathetic to the royal cause, as one of his [[pursuivant]]s was used as a messenger by the King's councillors. He did not join the royal army, however.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Michael Hicks has suggested that both Bonville and Courtenay were more interested in prosecuting their own feud than the national one.{{Sfn|Hicks|1998|p=94}} King Henry had been captured by the Yorkists after the battle: once again they controlled the government.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Although clearly unwilling to turn against his King at this point,{{Sfn|Grummitt|2013|p=59}} Bonville did attend the Yorkist parliament of September 1455, where he voted in favour of the Duke of York's appointment as protector.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1984|p=78}} Bonville was appointed to the parliamentary committee set up to improve naval defence.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} He also used his local influence to ensure that the vacant [[Bishop of Exeter|Bishopric of Exeter]] was reserved for the Earl of Salisbury's youngest son, [[George Neville (Archbishop)|George Neville]],{{Sfn|Pollard|2000|p=149}} and in November Bonville received a general [[Royal pardon|pardon]].{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=770 n.202}}\n\nIn the southwest, Bonville and his ally, [[James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond|James Butler, Earl of Wiltshire]] (also at this time very close to the court) were recruiting heavily.{{Sfn|Grummitt|2013|p=36}} They caused a proclamation \"to be cryed at Taunton in Somersetshire that every man that is likely and wole go with theym and serve theym shalle have ''vjd.''

On April 19, 1775, the first day of the [[American Revolutionary War]], provincial [[minutemen]] and [[Militia (United States)|militia]] companies numbering approximately 400 engaged roughly 90 [[British Army during the American Revolutionary War|British Army]] troops at this location. The battle was the first instance in which American forces advanced in formation on the British [[Regular Army|regulars]], inflicted casualties, and routed their opponents.\n\nThere have been at least eight iterations of the North Bridge. The current wooden pedestrian bridge, an approximate replica of the bridge that stood at the time of the battle, was built in 1956 and extensively restored in 2005. The bridge and the surrounding 114 acres of land make up what is known as the North Bridge unit of the [[Minute Man National Historical Park]] and is managed by the [[National Park Service]]. It is a popular tourist destination.\n\n==Origin and earliest iterations==\nThe Town of Concord was settled in 1635. Over the next two decades, colonial settlers established farms in the north quarter of the town. Many of these farms lay on the opposite side of the Concord River from the town center. To facilitate travel from their farms to the town, north quarter land owners built a bridge over the Concord River at or near this location by the early 1650s. The first mention of a bridge at this location appears in town records in 1654.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=12}} The farm road crossing the bridge was later improved and known at the [[Groton, Massachusetts|Groton]] Road.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=14}}\n\n==The \"Concord Fight\"==\n{{main|Battle of Concord#The North Bridge}}\nThe engagement which took place at the North Bridge has historically been known as the \"Concord Fight\" and was a part of the larger Battles of Lexington and Concord. In 1775, five companies of [[Minutemen (militia)|Minutemen]] and five of non-Minuteman militia occupied a hill near the bridge with groups of other men streaming in, totaling about 400 against the British light infantry companies from the 4th, 10th, and 43rd Regiments of Foot under Captain Walter Laurie, a force totaling about 90-95 men. The British retreated across the river and the two sides faced each other across the North Bridge.\n\nA brief exchange of fire ensued which saw the first instance of Americans firing to deadly effect on British regulars, after which the British retreated. Ralph Waldo Emerson, positing that world history pivoted at that moment (an assertion that is disputed, as earlier events at [[Lexington Battle Green]] could be termed the true opening of the battle), called the first shot of this skirmish the \"[[Shot heard round the world#Skirmish at the North Bridge|shot heard round the world]]\" in his 1837 poem \"[[Concord Hymn]]\".\n\n==Later iterations of the bridge==\n[[File:Memorial obelisk - Old North Bridge.jpg|thumb|Memorial obelisk adjacent to the North Bridge on the eastern bank.]]\n[[Image:Minute Man, Daniel Chester French, Concord MA.jpg|thumb|right|[[Daniel Chester French]]'s 1874 statue, ''[[The Minute Man]]'', adjacent to the North Bridge.

Inscribed on the eastern (approach) side of the monument is: \"HERE On the 19 of April, 1775, was made the first forcible resistance to British aggression[.] On the opposite Bank stood the American Militia[.] Here stood the Invading Army and on this spot the first of the Enemy fell in the War of that Revolution which gave Independence to these United States[.] In gratitude to GOD and In the love of Freedom this Monument was erected AD. 1836.\"\n\nOn [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], July 4, 1837, the memorial was dedicated, an event for which [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] wrote his \"[[Concord Hymn]]\".  The first, and best known, of the four stanzas of this poem is:\n{{quote|By the rude bridge that arched the flood,<br>\nTheir flag to April's breeze unfurled,<br>\nHere once the embattled farmers stood<br>\nAnd fired the [[shot heard round the world]].}}\n\nThe first stanza of \"Concord Hymn\" is inscribed at the base of the statue ''[[The Minute Man]]'' by [[Daniel Chester French]]. The statue, which stands on a 7-foot-tall [[granite]] pedestal, was cast in the Ames Foundry in [[Chicopee, Massachusetts]] and was made from seven [[American Civil War]] cannons donated for the project by Congress. The statue, and the 1875 bridge, were dedicated on April 19, 1875 at a centennial recognition of the original battle of April 19, 1775.<ref>Wilson, p.&nbsp;147</ref>\n\n[[File:Grave of British Soldiers at Old North Bridge, July 2014.jpg|thumbnail|The [[King's Colours]] adorn the grave of British soldiers.]]\n\nAmerican poet [[James Russell Lowell]] wrote in his poem \"Lines\" (1849) of the graves of two of the three British soldiers who died at the bridge:\n{{quote|Two graves are here: to mark the place,<br>\nAt head and foot, an unhewn stone,<br>\nO'er which the herald lichens trace<br>\nThe blazon of Oblivion.}}\nBut in 1910 residents of Concord placed a plaque to mark the graves using other lines from Lowell's poem:<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/mima/NorthBridge%20Restoration.html | title = untitled | accessdate = 8 July 2008}}</ref>\n{{quote|Grave of British Soldiers<br>\nThey came three thousand miles and died,<br>\nto keep the past upon its throne:<br>\nUnheard, beyond the ocean tide,<br>\ntheir English Mother made her moan.<br>\nApril 19, 1775}}\nThe grave is at a rock wall near the bridge at its eastern end.\n\n==1975 Bicentennial Commemoration==\nOn the 200th anniversary of the battle, President [[Gerald Ford]] traveled to Concord and gave a speech at the bridge as part of the [[United States Bicentennial]] celebrations.<ref>http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/diary/pdd750419.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/0122/1252290.pdf</ref>\n\n==Nearby sites==\n\nAmong the natural areas near North Bridge are [[Egg Rock]] 0.5 miles southwest (upstream) at the confluence of the [[Assabet River|Assabet]] and [[Sudbury River|Sudbury]] rivers, where they form the Concord River. Just 0.7 miles downstream from the bridge is a portion of the [[Great Meadows National Wildlife Refuge]], an outstanding [[New England]] [[birdwatching]] location with a trail. [[Punkatasset Hill]] is northwest of the bridge and is where the colonial militias watched the British forces at the bridge. The hill is adjacent to [[Estabrook Woods]], a wild tract of more than 1,200 acres (4.9&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of woodland, hills, ledge, and swamp that used to be visited by [[Henry David Thoreau]].\n\nA mansion was built over looking the bridge in 1911 by Stedman Buttrick, a great great grandson of Major John Buttrick who led the colonial forces to the bridge when they were fired upon by the British.<ref>[[Colonel James Barrett]] of Concord was in charge of all the colonial forces at the hill. He chose Major John Buttrick of Concord to lead the units advancing to the bridge. [[Lt. Col. John Robinson]] from Westford joined this contingent but deferred command to Buttrick. Captain [[Isaac Davis (soldier)|Isaac Davis]] commanded the Minuteman company from Acton that was at the vanguard of the colonials' march. At about the same time [[Col. James Barrett Farm|Colonel Barrett's farm]] was being searched by four companies of Regulars. Major Buttrick's home was just about 100 yards from the militia's mustering field. It can be seen on the hill above the bridge in the [[Amos Doolittle]] print.</ref> In 1962 the National Park Service bought the mansion, its once extensive flower garden and surrounding land from the Buttrick family. It uses the building for a visitor center and administrative offices.\nAlthough the gardens created and cared for by Stedman Buttrick and his son Stedman have suffered since their purchase by the Park Service they were once grand enough to have been featured in a 15-page article in the May 1959 issue of ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' magazine.\n\n[[The Old Manse]], Emerson's ancestral home and later residence of writer [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], is immediately adjacent to the North Bridge.\n\nOn the east side of Monument Street, where the pedestrian crosswalk from the parking lot goes to the [[all\u00e9e]] leading to the bridge, is chiseled in blocks a line from Emerson's address at the 1875 dedication of French's Minuteman statue alluding to how the local resistance to the King's troops had far-reaching effects: \"The thunderbolt falls on an inch of ground, / but the light of it fills the horizon.\"\n\n==Other==\nThe bridge was the inspiration for a bridge in [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Magic Kingdom]], specifically the bridge leading from the hub in front of [[Cinderella Castle]] to the area celebrating American independence called [[Liberty Square (Magic Kingdom)|Liberty Square]].\n\nThe bridge also appears in the Bethesda Softworks game ''[[Fallout 4]]'', in a dilapidated form, at the starting area of the game.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Minute Man National Historical Park]]\n*[[The Old Manse]]\n*[[Shot heard 'round the world]]\n\n==Notes and citations==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite web |last=Dietrich-Smith |first=Deborah |title=Cultural Landscape Report: North Bridge Unit|publisher=Minute Man National Historical Park |date=2003 |url=https://www.nps.gov/mima/learn/management/upload/MIMA%20NB%20CLR%20-%20combined%20.pdfs.pdf |ref=harv }}\n*{{Cite web |last=Minute Man National Historical Park |first= |title=North Bridge Questions|publisher=National Park Service |date=2020 |url=https://www.nps.gov/mima/north-bridge-questions.htm |ref=harv }}\n*{{Cite web |last=Sullivan |first=Judith Q. |title=North Bridge Historic Structure Report|publisher=Minute Man National Historical Park |date=2004 |url=http://www.npshistory.com/publications/mima/North_Bridge_HSR.pdf/ |ref=harv }}\n*{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Susan|title=Literary Trail of Greater Boston|url=https://archive.org/details/literarytrailofg00wils|url-access=registration|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=[[Boston]]|year=2000|ISBN=0-618-05013-2}}\n\n==Picture gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:North Bridge Fight Detail.jpg|The engagement at the North Bridge in Concord.

On April 19, 1775, the first day of the [[American Revolutionary War]], provincial [[minutemen]] and [[Militia (United States)|militia]] companies numbering approximately 400 engaged roughly 90 [[British Army during the American Revolutionary War|British Army]] troops at this location. The battle was the first instance in which American forces advanced in formation on the British [[Regular Army|regulars]], inflicted casualties, and routed their opponents.\n\nThere have been at least eight iterations of the North Bridge. The current wooden pedestrian bridge, an approximate replica of the bridge that stood at the time of the battle, was built in 1956 and extensively restored in 2005. The bridge and the surrounding 114 acres of land make up what is known as the North Bridge unit of the [[Minute Man National Historical Park]] and is managed by the [[National Park Service]]. It is a popular tourist destination.\n\n==Origin and earliest iterations==\nThe Town of Concord was settled in 1635. Over the next two decades, colonial settlers established farms in the north quarter of the town. Many of these farms lay on the opposite side of the Concord River from the town center. To facilitate travel from their farms to the town, north quarter land owners built a bridge over the Concord River at or near this location by the early 1650s. The first mention of a bridge at this location appear in town records in 1654.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=12}} The farm road crossing the bridge was later improved and known at the [[Groton, Massachusetts|Groton]] Road.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=14}}\n\n==The \"Concord Fight\"==\n{{main|Battle of Concord#The North Bridge}}\nThe engagement which took place at the North Bridge has historically been known as the \"Concord Fight\" and was a part of the larger Battles of Lexington and Concord.
