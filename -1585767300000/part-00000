The UK [[Accession of the United Kingdom to the European Communities|joined]] the [[European Communities]] (EC) \u2013 principally the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) \u2013 in 1973, and its continued membership was endorsed in a [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, withdrawal from the EC was advocated mainly by the political left, e.g. in the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]'s 1983 election manifesto. The 1992 [[Maastricht Treaty]] founded the EU, but was not put to a referendum. The Eurosceptic wing of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] led a [[Maastricht Rebels|rebellion]] over ratification of the treaty and, with the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP) and the cross-party [[People's Pledge]] campaign, pressured the Conservative [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] [[David Cameron]] to hold a [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|referendum]] on continued EU membership, which was held in June 2016. Cameron, who had campaigned to remain, resigned after the result and was succeeded by [[Theresa May]].\n\nOn 29 March 2017, the UK government formally began the withdrawal process by [[United Kingdom invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|invoking Article 50]] of the [[Treaty on European Union]] with [[European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017|permission from Parliament]]. May called a [[2017 United Kingdom general election|snap general election]] in June 2017, which resulted in a Conservative minority government [[Confidence and supply|supported]] by the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP). UK\u2013EU [[Brexit negotiations|withdrawal negotiations]] began later that month. The UK negotiated to leave the EU customs union and single market. This resulted in the November 2018 [[Brexit withdrawal agreement|withdrawal agreement]], but the British parliament [[Parliamentary votes on Brexit|voted against ratifying it]] three times. The Labour Party wanted any agreement to maintain a customs union, while many Conservatives opposed the agreement's [[Brexit divorce bill|financial settlement]], as well as the \"[[Irish backstop]]\" designed to prevent border controls between [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]]. The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP), and others sought to reverse Brexit through a [[Proposed referendum on the Brexit withdrawal agreement|proposed second referendum]].\n\nIn March 2019, the British parliament voted for May to ask the EU to delay Brexit until April, and then later October. Having failed to get her agreement approved, May resigned as Prime Minister in July and was succeeded by [[Boris Johnson]]. He sought to replace parts of the agreement and vowed to leave the EU by the new deadline. On 17 October 2019, the British government and the EU agreed on a revised withdrawal agreement, with new arrangements for Northern Ireland.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/revised_withdrawal_agreement_including_protocol_on_ireland_and_nothern_ireland.pdf|title=Revised Withdrawal Agreement|last=|first=|date=17 October 2019|website=|publisher=European Commission|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191017103006/https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/revised_withdrawal_agreement_including_protocol_on_ireland_and_nothern_ireland.pdf|archive-date=17 October 2019|access-date=17 October 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC News\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-50079385|title=New Brexit deal agreed, says Boris Johnson|date=17 October 2019|work=BBC News|access-date=17 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191213193556/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-50079385|archive-date=13 December 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Parliament approved the agreement for further scrutiny, but rejected passing it into law before the 31 October deadline, and forced the government (through the \"[[European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019|Benn Act]]\") to ask for a third Brexit delay.

In accordance with [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British constitutional convention]], specifically that of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], ratification in the UK was not subject to approval by referendum. Despite this, British constitutional historian [[Vernon Bogdanor]] wrote that there was \"a clear constitutional rationale for requiring a referendum\" because although MPs are entrusted with legislative power by the electorate, they are not given authority to transfer that power (the UK's previous three referendums all concerned this). Further, as the ratification of the treaty was in the manifestos of the three major political parties, voters opposed to ratification had no way to express it. For Bogdanor, while the ratification by the House of Commons might be legal, it would not be legitimate\u2014which requires popular consent. The way in which the treaty was ratified, he judged, was \"likely to have fundamental consequences both for British politics and for Britain's relationship with the [EC].\"<ref>Bogdanor also quotes [[John Locke]]'s ''[[Two Treatises of Government|The Second Treatise of Government]]'': 'The Legislative cannot transfer the power of making laws to any other hands. For it being but a delegated power from the People, they who have it cannot pass it to others.' \u2013 Bogdanor, Vernon (8 June 1993).

This includes multilateral agreements based on consensus, where Britain must re-approach 132 separate parties. Around 110 separate opt-in accords at the UN and World Trade Organization are excluded from the estimates, as are narrow agreements on the environment, health, research and science. Some additional UK bilateral deals, outside the EU framework, may also need to be revised because they make reference to EU law. Some of the 759 are so essential that it would be unthinkable to operate without them. Air services agreements allow British aeroplanes to land in America, Canada or Israel; nuclear accords permit the trade in spare parts and fuel for Britain's power stations.

The UK [[Accession of the United Kingdom to the European Communities|joined]] the [[European Communities]] (EC) \u2013 principally the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) \u2013 in 1973, and its continued membership was endorsed in a [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, withdrawal from the EC was advocated mainly by the political left, e.g. in the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]'s 1983 election manifesto. The 1992 [[Maastricht Treaty]] founded the EU, but was not put to a referendum. The Eurosceptic wing of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] led a [[Maastricht Rebels|rebellion]] over ratification of the treaty and, with the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP) and the cross-party [[People's Pledge]] campaign, pressured the Conservative [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] [[David Cameron]] to hold a [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|referendum]] on continued EU membership, which was held in June 2016. Cameron, who had campaigned to remain, resigned after the result and was succeeded by [[Theresa May]].\n\nOn 29 March 2017, the UK government formally began the withdrawal process by [[United Kingdom invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|invoking Article 50]] of the [[Treaty on European Union]] with [[European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017|permission from Parliament]]. May called a [[2017 United Kingdom general election|snap general election]] in June 2017, which resulted in a Conservative minority government [[Confidence and supply|supported]] by the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP). UK\u2013EU [[Brexit negotiations|withdrawal negotiations]] began later that month. The UK negotiated to leave the EU customs union and single market. This resulted in the November 2018 [[Brexit withdrawal agreement|withdrawal agreement]], but the British parliament [[Parliamentary votes on Brexit|voted against ratifying it]] three times. The Labour Party wanted any agreement to maintain a customs union, while many Conservatives opposed the agreement's [[Brexit divorce bill|financial settlement]], as well as the \"[[Irish backstop]]\" designed to prevent border controls between [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]]. The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP), and others sought to reverse Brexit through a [[Proposed referendum on the Brexit withdrawal agreement|proposed second referendum]].\n\nIn March 2019, the British parliament voted for May to ask the EU to delay Brexit until April, and then later October. Having failed to get her agreement approved, May resigned as Prime Minister in July and was succeeded by [[Boris Johnson]]. He sought to replace parts of the agreement and vowed to leave the EU by the new deadline. On 17 October 2019, the British government and the EU agreed on a revised withdrawal agreement, with new arrangements for Northern Ireland.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/revised_withdrawal_agreement_including_protocol_on_ireland_and_nothern_ireland.pdf|title=Revised Withdrawal Agreement|last=|first=|date=17 October 2019|website=|publisher=European Commission|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191017103006/https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/revised_withdrawal_agreement_including_protocol_on_ireland_and_nothern_ireland.pdf|archive-date=17 October 2019|access-date=17 October 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC News\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-50079385|title=New Brexit deal agreed, says Boris Johnson|date=17 October 2019|work=BBC News|access-date=17 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191213193556/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-50079385|archive-date=13 December 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Parliament approved the agreement for further scrutiny, but rejected passing it into law before the 31 October deadline, and forced the government (through the \"[[European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019|Benn Act]]\") to ask for a third Brexit delay.

In accordance with [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British constitutional convention]], specifically that of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], ratification in the UK was not subject to approval by referendum. Despite this, British constitutional historian [[Vernon Bogdanor]] wrote that there was \"a clear constitutional rationale for requiring a referendum\" because although MPs are entrusted with legislative power by the electorate, they are not given authority to transfer that power (the UK's previous three referendums all concerned this). Further, as the ratification of the treaty was in the manifestos of the three major political parties, voters opposed to ratification had no way to express it. For Bogdanor, while the ratification by the House of Commons might be legal, it would not be legitimate\u2014which requires popular consent. The way in which the treaty was ratified, he judged, was \"likely to have fundamental consequences both for British politics and for Britain's relationship with the [EC].\"<ref>Bogdanor also quotes [[John Locke]]'s ''[[Two Treatises of Government|The Second Treatise of Government]]'': 'The Legislative cannot transfer the power of making laws to any other hands. For it being but a delegated power from the People, they who have it cannot pass it to others.' \u2013 Bogdanor, Vernon (8 June 1993).

This includes multilateral agreements based on consensus, where Britain must re-approach 132 separate parties. Around 110 separate opt-in accords at the UN and World Trade Organization are excluded from the estimates, as are narrow agreements on the environment, health, research and science. Some additional UK bilateral deals, outside the EU framework, may also need to be revised because they make reference to EU law.

Monks from the abbey began the development of the area, cultivating the land and embanking the riverside. They turned an adjacent tidal inlet at the mouth of the [[River Neckinger]] into a dock, named [[St Saviour's Dock]] after their abbey. But Bermondsey then was little more than a high street ribbon (the modern Bermondsey Street), leading from the southern bank of the Thames, at Tooley Street, up to the abbey close.\n\nThe [[Knights Templar]] also owned land here and gave their names to one of the most distinctive streets in London, [[Shad Thames]] (a corruption of \"St John at Thames\"). Other ecclesiastical properties stood nearby at Tooley (a corruption of \"[[Saint Olaf|St Olave's]]\") Street, located in the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]'s manor of Southwark, where wealthy citizens and clerics had their houses, including the priors of [[Lewes Priory|Lewes]] and [[St Augustine's Abbey|St Augustine's]], Canterbury, and the abbot of [[Battle Abbey|Battle]].\n\n===14th century===\n[[Edward III of England|King Edward III]] built a manor house close to the Thames in Bermondsey in 1353. The excavated foundations are visible next to [[Bermondsey Wall East]] close to the famous Angel public house.<ref>Staff.

After the [[Great Fire of London]], it was settled by the well-to-do and took on the character of a garden suburb especially along the lines of [[Grange Walk, Southwark|Grange Road]], as Bermondsey Street became more urbanised, and of Jamaica/ Lower Road. A pleasure garden was founded there in the 17th century, commemorated by the [[Cherry Garden Pier]]. [[Samuel Pepys]] visited \"Jamaica House\" at Cherry Gardens in 1664 and recorded in his diary that he had left it \"singing finely\". Jamaica Road still remains.\n\nThough not many buildings survive from this era, one notable exception is the church of [[St Mary Magdalen (Bermondsey)|St Mary Magdalen]] in [[Bermondsey Street]], completed in 1690 (although a church has been recorded on this site from the 13th Century). This church came through both 19th-century redevelopment and [[The Blitz]] unscathed. It is not just an unusual survivor for Bermondsey; buildings of this era are relative rarities in [[Inner London]] in general.\n\n===18th century===\nIn the 18th century, the discovery of a spring from the [[river Neckinger]] in the area led to the development of [[Bermondsey Spa]], as the area between Grange and Jamaica Roads called Spa Road commemorates.<ref>[http://bermondsey.org/bermondsey-spa-gardens/ Bermondsey Spa Gardens], Sean Spurr, Bermondsey.org, Accessed 5 August 2012</ref> A new church was built for the growing population of the area, and named [[St John Horsleydown]].\n\n===19th century===\nIt was from the Bermondsey riverside that the painter [[J.M.W. Turner]] executed his famous painting of ''[[The Fighting Temeraire|The Fighting \"Temeraire\" Tugged to her Last Berth to be Broken Up]]'' (1839), depicting the veteran warship being towed to [[Rotherhithe]] to be scrapped.\n\nBy the mid-19th century, parts of Bermondsey, especially along the riverside, had become notorious slums with the arrival of industrial plants, docks and immigrant housing. The area around St. Saviour's Dock, known as [[Jacob's Island]], was one of the worst in London. It was immortalised in [[Charles Dickens]]'s novel ''[[Oliver Twist]]'', in which the villain, [[Bill Sikes]], meets his end in the mud of 'Folly Ditch', in reference to Hickman's Folly, which surrounded Jacob's Island.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.danceshistoricalmiscellany.com/filth-disease-dickens-jacobs-island-london-slum/|title=Filth, disease and Dickens: Jacob\u2019s Island, a London slum|last=Dance|first=Caecilia|date=2013-11-10|work=Dance's Historical Miscellany|access-date=2018-08-04|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hsomerville.com/meccano/Articles/JacobsIsland.htm|title=Jacob's Island|last=Somerville|first=Howard|date=|website=Howard Somerville's MECCANO Site|access-date=2018-08-04}}</ref> Dickens provides a vivid description of what it was like:<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/730/730-h/730-h.htm|title=Oliver Twist; or, the Parish Boy's Progress|last=Dickens|first=Charles|publisher=|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Chapter 50: The Pursuit and Escape|via=Project Gutenberg}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=... crazy wooden galleries common to the backs of half a dozen houses, with holes from which to look upon the slime beneath; windows, broken and patched, with poles thrust out, on which to dry the linen that is never there; rooms so small, so filthy, so confined, that the air would seem to be too tainted even for the dirt and squalor which they shelter; wooden chambers thrusting themselves out above the mud and threatening to fall into it\u2014as some have done; dirt-besmeared walls and decaying foundations, every repulsive lineament of poverty, every loathsome indication of filth, rot, and garbage: all these ornament the banks of Jacob's Island.}}\n\nBermondsey Town Hall was built on Spa Road in 1881 but Blitzed in 1941.\nThe area was extensively redeveloped during the 19th century and early 20th century with the expansion of the river trade and the arrival of the [[railway]]s. London's first passenger railway terminus was built by the [[London to Greenwich Railway]] in 1836 at [[London Bridge station|London Bridge]]. The first section to be used was between the [[Spa Road Station]] and Deptford High Street. This local station had closed by 1915.\n\n[[File:London Leather, Hide & Wool Exchange.jpg|thumb|Leather, Hide and Wool Exchange, at left and Leather Market at right]]\nThe industrial boom of the 19th century was an extension of Bermondsey's manufacturing role in earlier eras. As in the [[East End]], industries that were deemed too noisome to be carried on within the narrow confines of the [[City of London]] had been located here \u2014 one such that came to dominate central Bermondsey, away from the riverfront, was the processing and trading of [[leather]] and [[Hide (skin)|hides]]. Many of the warehouse buildings from this era survive around Bermondsey Street, Tanner Street, Morocco Street and Leathermarket Street including the huge Leather Market of 1833 and the Leather, Hide and Wool Exchange of 1878; virtually all are now residential and small work spaces or offices). Hepburn and Gale's [[Tanning (leather)|tannery]] (disused as of early 2007) on Long Lane is also a substantial surviving building of the leather trade. The Exchange building had a fine private club, effectively a [[gentlemen's club]] for the leading merchants and manufacturers. In 1703 they had acquired a royal charter from [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] to gain a monoploy of trading and training of [[apprentice]]s for within {{convert|30|mi|km|sigfig=1|abbr=off}} of the ancient parish, similar to a City [[livery company]], the [[Bermondsey tanners|Bermondsey Tanners]].\n\n[[Peek Freans|Peek, Frean and Co]] was established in 1857 at Dockhead, Bermondsey by James Peek and George Hender Frean.

They suffered severe damage in [[World War II]] bombing and became redundant in the 1960s following the collapse of the river trade. After standing derelict for some years, many of the wharves were redeveloped under the aegis of the [[London Docklands Development Corporation]] during the 1980s. They have now been converted into a mixture of residential and commercial accommodations and have become some of the most upmarket and expensive properties in London. In 1997, US President [[Bill Clinton]] and Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] visited the area to dine at the Le Pont de la Tour restaurant at Butler's Wharf.\n\n[[File:Bermondsey fashion museum 1.jpg|thumb|left|Bermondsey Fashion and Textiles Museum (March 2007)]]\nBermondsey had been host to London's first railway, from [[Spa Road railway station]], as part of the London Bridge to Greenwich line, and the junction of lines from Croydon and Kent at South Bermondsey, the Brunels Rotherhithe foot-tunnel was converted into part of the East London Railway with original connections from Liverpool Street Station via Whitechapel to New Cross and New Cross Gate. However, reorganisation of lines and temporary closure of stations left Bermondsey's transport links with the rest of London poorer in the late Twentieth Century.

The Southwark parishes of St Olave's and [[St John's Horsleydown]] (the latter a 'daughter' of the former) with St Thomas's formed a parish union ('District Board of Works') known as 'St Olave's' from that date. This was the arrangement within the London County from 1889. In 1899 St Olave and St Thomas's District was created as a single civil parish and the next year, following London government reorganisation, this was merged with Rotherhithe and part of Deptford to form, with Bermondsey civil parish, the [[Metropolitan Borough of Bermondsey]]. The Borough's first Mayor was Samuel Bourne Bevington (1832\u20131907), leather producer and one of the area's largest employers; his statue still stands in Tooley Street.<ref>Farrell, Jerome: ''Big in Bermondsey: Colonel Sam Bevington'', in the ''Leathersellers' Review'', 2009\u201310, pp 16\u201317</ref> This Borough disappeared into the London Borough of Southwark, in the Greater London reorganisation of 1964.\n\n==Governance==\nSouthwark London Borough Council has divided the borough into a number of community council areas.

From 1885 to 1918, a separate [[Bermondsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Bermondsey constituency]] existed, which included part of the older Southwark constituency. 1918 saw the seat split between two new constituencies: [[Rotherhithe (UK Parliament constituency)|Rotherhithe]] and [[Bermondsey West (UK Parliament constituency)|Bermondsey West]], both of which were in place until the 1950 general election when the old Bermondsey seat was recreated.\n\nIn 1983, the area played host to the famous [[1983 Bermondsey by-election|Bermondsey by-election]] in which [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]'s [[Peter Tatchell]] lost the previously safe Labour seat to the Liberal [[Simon Hughes]] on a [[Swing (politics)|swing]] of 44%, which even now remains the largest by-election swing in British political history.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/mar/25/simonhughes |title=Guardian Simon Hughes |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=25 March 2001 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510060351/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/mar/25/simonhughes |archivedate=10 May 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref> Hughes represented the area until 2015 when he was defeated by the Labour candidate [[Neil Coyle]].

(eds.), ''Domesday Book A Complete Translation'', Penguin, 2002, pp. 72, 80.</ref>\n\nThe church mentioned in Domesday Book was presumably the nascent [[Bermondsey Abbey]], which was founded as a [[Cluny Abbey|Cluniac]] [[prior]]y in 1082, and was dedicated to St Saviour. Monks from the abbey began the development of the area, cultivating the land and embanking the riverside. They turned an adjacent tidal inlet at the mouth of the [[River Neckinger]] into a dock, named [[St Saviour's Dock]] after their abbey. But Bermondsey then was little more than a high street ribbon (the modern Bermondsey Street), leading from the southern bank of the Thames, at Tooley Street, up to the abbey close.\n\nThe [[Knights Templar]] also owned land here and gave their names to one of the most distinctive streets in London, [[Shad Thames]] (a corruption of \"St John at Thames\"). Other ecclesiastical properties stood nearby at Tooley (a corruption of \"[[Saint Olaf|St Olave's]]\") Street, located in the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]'s manor of Southwark, where wealthy citizens and clerics had their houses, including the priors of [[Lewes Priory|Lewes]] and [[St Augustine's Abbey|St Augustine's]], Canterbury, and the abbot of [[Battle Abbey|Battle]].\n\n===14th century===\n[[Edward III of England|King Edward III]] built a manor house close to the Thames in Bermondsey in 1353. The excavated foundations are visible next to [[Bermondsey Wall East]] close to the famous Angel public house.<ref>Staff.

After the [[Great Fire of London]], it was settled by the well-to-do and took on the character of a garden suburb especially along the lines of [[Grange Walk, Southwark|Grange Road]], as Bermondsey Street became more urbanised, and of Jamaica/ Lower Road. A pleasure garden was founded there in the 17th century, commemorated by the [[Cherry Garden Pier]]. [[Samuel Pepys]] visited \"Jamaica House\" at Cherry Gardens in 1664 and recorded in his diary that he had left it \"singing finely\". Jamaica Road still remains.\n\nThough not many buildings survive from this era, one notable exception is the church of [[St Mary Magdalen (Bermondsey)|St Mary Magdalen]] in [[Bermondsey Street]], completed in 1690 (although a church has been recorded on this site from the 13th Century). This church came through both 19th-century redevelopment and [[The Blitz]] unscathed. It is not just an unusual survivor for Bermondsey; buildings of this era are relative rarities in [[Inner London]] in general.\n\n===18th century===\nIn the 18th century, the discovery of a spring from the [[river Neckinger]] in the area led to the development of [[Bermondsey Spa]], as the area between Grange and Jamaica Roads called Spa Road commemorates.<ref>[http://bermondsey.org/bermondsey-spa-gardens/ Bermondsey Spa Gardens], Sean Spurr, Bermondsey.org, Accessed 5 August 2012</ref> A new church was built for the growing population of the area, and named [[St John Horsleydown]].\n\n===19th century===\nIt was from the Bermondsey riverside that the painter [[J.M.W.

The area around St. Saviour's Dock, known as [[Jacob's Island]], was one of the worst in London. It was immortalised in [[Charles Dickens]]'s novel ''[[Oliver Twist]]'', in which the villain, [[Bill Sikes]], meets his end in the mud of 'Folly Ditch', in reference to Hickman's Folly, which surrounded Jacob's Island.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.danceshistoricalmiscellany.com/filth-disease-dickens-jacobs-island-london-slum/|title=Filth, disease and Dickens: Jacob\u2019s Island, a London slum|last=Dance|first=Caecilia|date=2013-11-10|work=Dance's Historical Miscellany|access-date=2018-08-04|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hsomerville.com/meccano/Articles/JacobsIsland.htm|title=Jacob's Island|last=Somerville|first=Howard|date=|website=Howard Somerville's MECCANO Site|access-date=2018-08-04}}</ref> Dickens provides a vivid description of what it was like:<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/730/730-h/730-h.htm|title=Oliver Twist; or, the Parish Boy's Progress|last=Dickens|first=Charles|publisher=|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Chapter 50: The Pursuit and Escape|via=Project Gutenberg}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=... crazy wooden galleries common to the backs of half a dozen houses, with holes from which to look upon the slime beneath; windows, broken and patched, with poles thrust out, on which to dry the linen that is never there; rooms so small, so filthy, so confined, that the air would seem to be too tainted even for the dirt and squalor which they shelter; wooden chambers thrusting themselves out above the mud and threatening to fall into it\u2014as some have done; dirt-besmeared walls and decaying foundations, every repulsive lineament of poverty, every loathsome indication of filth, rot, and garbage: all these ornament the banks of Jacob's Island.}}\n\nBermondsey Town Hall was built on Spa Road in 1881 but Blitzed in 1941.\nThe area was extensively redeveloped during the 19th century and early 20th century with the expansion of the river trade and the arrival of the [[railway]]s. London's first passenger railway terminus was built by the [[London to Greenwich Railway]] in 1836 at [[London Bridge station|London Bridge]]. The first section to be used was between the [[Spa Road Station]] and Deptford High Street. This local station had closed by 1915.\n\n[[File:London Leather, Hide & Wool Exchange.jpg|thumb|Leather, Hide and Wool Exchange, at left and Leather Market at right]]\nThe industrial boom of the 19th century was an extension of Bermondsey's manufacturing role in earlier eras. As in the [[East End]], industries that were deemed too noisome to be carried on within the narrow confines of the [[City of London]] had been located here \u2014 one such that came to dominate central Bermondsey, away from the riverfront, was the processing and trading of [[leather]] and [[Hide (skin)|hides]]. Many of the warehouse buildings from this era survive around Bermondsey Street, Tanner Street, Morocco Street and Leathermarket Street including the huge Leather Market of 1833 and the Leather, Hide and Wool Exchange of 1878; virtually all are now residential and small work spaces or offices). Hepburn and Gale's [[Tanning (leather)|tannery]] (disused as of early 2007) on Long Lane is also a substantial surviving building of the leather trade. The Exchange building had a fine private club, effectively a [[gentlemen's club]] for the leading merchants and manufacturers. In 1703 they had acquired a royal charter from [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] to gain a monoploy of trading and training of [[apprentice]]s for within {{convert|30|mi|km|sigfig=1|abbr=off}} of the ancient parish, similar to a City [[livery company]], the [[Bermondsey tanners|Bermondsey Tanners]].\n\n[[Peek Freans|Peek, Frean and Co]] was established in 1857 at Dockhead, Bermondsey by James Peek and George Hender Frean.

They suffered severe damage in [[World War II]] bombing and became redundant in the 1960s following the collapse of the river trade. After standing derelict for some years, many of the wharves were redeveloped under the aegis of the [[London Docklands Development Corporation]] during the 1980s. They have now been converted into a mixture of residential and commercial accommodations and have become some of the most upmarket and expensive properties in London. In 1997, US President [[Bill Clinton]] and Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] visited the area to dine at the Le Pont de la Tour restaurant at Butler's Wharf.\n\n[[File:Bermondsey fashion museum 1.jpg|thumb|left|Bermondsey Fashion and Textiles Museum (March 2007)]]\nBermondsey had been host to London's first railway, from [[Spa Road railway station]], as part of the London Bridge to Greenwich line, and the junction of lines from Croydon and Kent at South Bermondsey, the Brunels Rotherhithe foot-tunnel was converted into part of the East London Railway with original connections from Liverpool Street Station via Whitechapel to New Cross and New Cross Gate. However, reorganisation of lines and temporary closure of stations left Bermondsey's transport links with the rest of London poorer in the late Twentieth Century.

The Southwark parishes of St Olave's and [[St John's Horsleydown]] (the latter a 'daughter' of the former) with St Thomas's formed a parish union ('District Board of Works') known as 'St Olave's' from that date. This was the arrangement within the London County from 1889. In 1899 St Olave and St Thomas's District was created as a single civil parish and the next year, following London government reorganisation, this was merged with Rotherhithe and part of Deptford to form, with Bermondsey civil parish, the [[Metropolitan Borough of Bermondsey]]. The Borough's first Mayor was Samuel Bourne Bevington (1832\u20131907), leather producer and one of the area's largest employers; his statue still stands in Tooley Street.<ref>Farrell, Jerome: ''Big in Bermondsey: Colonel Sam Bevington'', in the ''Leathersellers' Review'', 2009\u201310, pp 16\u201317</ref> This Borough disappeared into the London Borough of Southwark, in the Greater London reorganisation of 1964.\n\n==Governance==\nSouthwark London Borough Council has divided the borough into a number of community council areas.

Originally fostered by [[Rita Sullivan|Rita Fairclough]] ([[Barbara Knox]]), she has been featured in storylines including her troubled relationship with her father and Rita's partner, [[Alan Bradley (Coronation Street)|Alan Bradley]] ([[Mark Eden]]), his death when he is killed in a tram accident after chasing Rita in [[Blackpool]], and a brief underage romance with married man Robert Weston ([[Philip Bretherton]]). Their separation in 1991 led to Jenny leaving Weatherfield on 1 March 1991.\n\nShe returns for a short stint on 17 September 1993 when she visits Rita for money, but Rita's rejection of her results in Jenny leaving again on 8 October 1993.

She is seen to develop an obsession with his young son [[Jack Webster (Coronation Street)|Jack]] (Jaxon and Maddox Beswick), which culminates in Jenny abducting him before being found in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], where she is arrested by police leading to her  departure on 15 June 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=Corrie Sally Ann Matthews says she was bombarded by death threats after child snatch story|publisher=[[Daily Mirror]]|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/corrie-sally-ann-matthews-says-5919542|first=Nigel|last=Pauley|date=20 June 2015|accessdate=30 June 2015}}</ref> On 11 August 2015, the official ''Coronation Street'' [[Twitter]] page announced that Jenny would be returning on 27 January 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/itvcorrie/status/631085811006631937|title=Coronation Street on Twitter|publisher=}}</ref> Although upon her return she is portrayed as a [[tragic character]], Jenny has somewhat become more comedic. She married [[Johnny Connor (Coronation Street)|Johnny Connor]] ([[Richard Hawley (actor)|Richard Hawley]]) in 2017 and her storylines since then have revolved around their relationship and she is often caught up in the family issues. Jenny and Johnny have since become the [[landlords]] of the [[Rovers Return Inn]].\n\n==Storylines==\n\n===1986\u20131993===\nJenny was fostered by Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox), following the death of her mother, Pat, in a road accident. Her father, Alan Bradley (Mark Eden), was traced after being absent for six years and re-entered her life. Although she initially felt bitter towards him, they soon bonded as he settled into No. 7 with Rita.\n\nAged seventeen, Jenny ran off to France with [[Martin Platt]] and met a medical student, Patrice Podevin (Franck Dubosc), and fell in love with him. Patrice followed her back to the UK and they got engaged, though Patrice promised Alan that he would wait until he had finished his studies before they got married. However, after he discovered that Jenny had kissed another man at a party, Patrice called off the engagement and returned to France. In 1989, on the Eve of her eighteenth birthday, Jenny stops Alan suffocating Rita but continues to stand by her father regardless, although she was torn between her loyalty to him and her love for Rita. Due to his trial plea, he is allowed to walk free but returns and starts stalking Rita, causing her to have a [[mental breakdown|breakdown]] and losing her memory. Rita moves to [[Blackpool]], but her absence makes many residents think Alan has killed her, and he becomes the object of widespread hatred and suspicion. Alan soon tracks Rita down but dies after being [[Coronation Street timeline#1989|hit and killed by a tram]] while chasing a distressed Rita across the tracks. Jenny blames Rita for his death and begins to study Biology at [[Manchester Metropolitan University|Weatherfield Polytechnic]] the following year. During this time, Rita moves into a flat on the other side of the street and rents the house to Jenny and her friend, Flick Khan ([[Rita Wolf]]), also a student at the Polytechnic. Jenny drops out of her course after becoming bored and starts an affair with a married dentist, Robert Weston ([[Philip Bretherton]]). When he leaves his wife, she moves in with him but the relationship does not last very long, and in 1991, Robert went back to his wife and Jenny left the street. In 1993 Jenny visited Rita and asked her for \u00a330,000 to start a beauty salon but Rita gave her \u00a31,000 and threw her out of her home. Jenny later marries a man named Mr. Midgeley and they had a son named Tom, who drowns in a paddling pool. Jenny left him unattended while she went inside to get her handbag for money to buy him an ice cream from the ice cream van. Tom was four years old when he died.<ref>{{cite web|title=Soap spoilers: Coronation Street kidnap, EastEnders discovery, Emmerdale returnee, Hollyoaks kiss|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a651319/soap-spoilers-coronation-street-kidnap-eastenders-discovery-emmerdale-returnee-hollyoaks-kiss.html#~peWZe9LQdVyYg8|first=Sophie|last=Dainty|author2=Kilkelly, Daniel|date=7 June 2015|accessdate=7 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===2015\u2013===\nJenny is revealed to be the woman [[Kevin Webster]] ([[Michael Le Vell]]) has been talking to on a dating website. Kevin asks her to come to [[Rovers Return Inn|The Rovers Return Inn]], but she told him that she wanted to put the past behind her and wondered how Rita would react to seeing her again. Later that month, Rita and Jenny met in The Rovers. Rita was distraught and Jenny stormed out of the pub because of [[Norris Cole (Coronation Street)|Norris Cole]]'s ([[Malcolm Hebden]]) nasty comments. Rita visited Jenny at Kevin's house and warned Jenny not to try her \"little schoolgirl tricks\". Jenny and Kevin slept together and she became obsessed with his son, [[Jack Webster (Coronation Street)|Jack]] (Jaxon and Maddox Beswick). Kevin's 20-year-old daughter, [[Sophie Webster]] ([[Brooke Vincent]]) becomes suspicious of Jenny and tells her girlfriend, [[Maddie Heath]] ([[Amy James-Kelly]]), and Kevin but they do not believe her. Sophie remains wary, despite Jenny's attempts to ingratiate herself. Maddie realises that Sophie was right when she goes home and finds that Jenny has packed a bag for Jack and is wearing a brunette wig. She guesses that Jenny is planning to run away with Jack and tries to stop her but Jenny pushes her over and vows that Maddie will not be leaving. Jenny mentions that she didn't mean to hurt \"Tom\", and a shaken Maddie manages to escape, only to be killed by an explosion triggered by [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]) setting fire to [[Carla Connor]]'s ([[Alison King]]) flat in Victoria Court.\n\nAfter Sophie and Kevin leave for Maddie's funeral, Jenny seizes the opportunity to abduct Jack as Kevin agrees that Jenny should look after him, leaving the Websters distraught. She takes him to a flat in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] and throws a birthday party in her dead son's memory. He had died aged four in April 2013 after apparently being left unsupervised in a paddling pool&nbsp;\u2013 with Jenny believing that Jack can take his place. When she notices Jack is not participating, she shouts at him and sends him to his room; Jenny is seen on the flat's balcony later with Jack, releasing balloons into the sky. Rita arrives after a tearful Jenny phoned her, asking her to visit. Rita visits, bringing Kevin and Sophie, but Jenny is enraged as she asked her to come alone. Sophie tells Jenny to bring Jack down but Jenny refuses, disturbed by her grief at losing Tom. Kevin tries to reason with her Jenny returns Jack and prepares to jump, feeling she has nothing to live for. As the police arrive, she breaks down in tears and says that she doesn't know who she is anymore, before she is arrested and brought down. She apologises to Kevin but he is no mood to listen and she is led away into a police car. The next day, Jenny is sectioned under the [[Mental Health Act 1983]]. In January 2016, Jenny contacts Rita through [[Facebook]]. Rita visits Jenny, who tells her she has changed and got a new flat. However, when Jenny runs away, Rita sees the state of Jenny's flat and allows her to stay with her; to the annoyance of Sophie and Kevin.\n\nShe later sparks a romance with [[Johnny Connor (Coronation Street)|Johnny Connor]] ([[Richard Hawley (actor)|Richard Hawley]]) and he takes her to [[Blackpool]] for her to say goodbye to her father on the anniversary of his death. Kevin and his friend [[Tim Metcalfe (Coronation Street)|Tim Metcalfe]] ([[Joe Duttine]]) have taken Jack to Blackpool as well. He runs from them and Jenny saves him from being hit by a tram, earning everyone's respect again. A few days later, once she has appeared in the newspaper; Jenny asks Johnny if she can get a job as a machinist to which he agrees. After work, he goes to teach her and Jenny flirts with him. Lead on by this, Johnny tries kissing Jenny but she pulls away. She still continues to flirt with him, however, meaning that she could be using him or she's \"playing hard to get\". Johnny later proposes to her.<ref>{{Citation|last=Coronation Street|title=Johnny Proposes To Jenny - Coronation Street|date=2017-01-06|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FTlYydI324|accessdate=2017-02-11}}</ref> They split up briefly but reconcile when Johnny tells her about his [[multiple sclerosis]]. On Jenny's hen night, Rita collapses and is taken to hospital and Jenny is upset when [[Gemma Winter]] (Dolly-Rose Campbell) tells her that Rita has been suffering from memory loss. The next day, Jenny and Johnny are unsure whether to go through with the wedding but they decide to get married and go to the venue on motorbikes. After Sally Metcalfe realised that nobody is there to give her away, she decides to do it. Later, Jenny and Johnny say their vows but realise they can't do it without Rita's presence and go to the hospital to get married there. Jenny and Johnny's new life as newlyweds doesn't go off to a great start when they find the factory empty of furniture and even without the roof intact. Upon learning that Johnny's son [[Aidan Connor]]'s ([[Shayne Ward]]) fianc\u00e9e [[Eva Price]] ([[Catherine Tyldesley]]) is responsible as revenge for Aidan's affair with [[Maria Connor]] ([[Samia Longchambon]]), they ultimately disown Aidan and eventually report Eva to the police. In time, however, Jenny and Johnny forgive Aidan and plan to move to [[Spain]] for a new life in the sun. However, a few days before they are due to leave, Aidan commits [[suicide]] and the Connor family is left distraught.\n\nJenny later finds out that Johnny had an affair with [[Liz McDonald]] ([[Beverley Callard]]) although she forgives him as he was grieving for Aidan. She, however, grows paranoid, drinks alone and puts a tracker onto Liz's phone. After Johnny finds out, they argue and Jenny falls down the stairs, leading Gemma to believe that Johnny is abusing Jenny. On Christmas Day 2018, an upset Jenny gets drunk and accidentally runs over Liz with Johnny's car. Johnny initially takes the blame but Jenny tells Liz as she cannot bare the thought of Johnny going to prison. Liz tells the police and they are both arrested. After this, Jenny starts to shut herself away and starts drinking heavily again. However, on the day of the trial, Liz changes her mind about going and instead goes on holiday, with the help of Gemma, who Jenny now sees as family. The next day, Jenny and Johnny have a heart-to-heart about their marriage when he quizzes her on her drinking. They both later realise how much they love and need each other, agreeing to put the last few months behind them.\n\n==Development==\n===Departure and brief return===\nMatthews decided to leave the programme in late 1990 and made her last appearance on 1 March 1991, in which Jenny moved in with married dentist Robert Weston. Matthews chose to leave in order to prove herself as an actress: \"I hadn't been to drama school, I am northern and I had been in a soap. People used to say 'she's just a soap actress' and I would think 'no, she's an actress'. I thought I would go and do lots of regional theatre to earn my stripes and gain respect as a result.\"\n\nIn 1993, Matthews accepted an offer to return as Jenny for ten episodes. Matthews hoped that by showcasing an older Jenny she could change casting directors' perceptions of her. Matthews: \"I was still getting offered rebellious teenage roles and I was 23. I thought I would go back so people could see I was older now and it worked.\" Jenny's departure scenes aired in October 1993. Matthews was subsequently asked to return, but declined due to fear of typecasting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/coronation-street/news/a626585/coronation-streets-sally-ann-matthews-talks-jenny-bradley-return/|title=Corrie: Sally Ann Matthews talks return|date=10 February 2015|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Reintroduction===\nMatthews' feelings towards returning to ''Coronation Street'' changed four years before the next invitation came. On 4 October 2014, it was reported that Matthews was in talks about returning to the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a601241/sally-ann-matthews-in-talks-to-return-to-coronation-street.html|title=Jenny Bradley to return to Corrie?|date=4 October 2014|publisher=}}</ref> It was then announced on 20 October 2014 that Jenny would be making a return to the show in February 2015. Matthews said: \"It was only in 2010\u2014when the 50th celebrations started and I was asked to do this and that\u2014that I thought, \u2018I\u2019m never going to get away from it, people still recognise me from it, I\u2019m dead proud I was in it, I should embrace it. So, that is when I started to feel differently about it and when they rang and asked me this time I said yes.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-02-10/coronation-street-spoilers-no-ones-pleased-to-see-jenny-bradley-reveals-sally-ann-matthews|title=Coronation Street spoilers: No one's pleased to see Jenny Bradley, reveals Sally Ann Matthews|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a604688/coronation-street-boss-confirms-jenny-bradley-return.html#~oTfc9NE1EWqF5T|title=Corrie boss confirms Jenny Bradley return|date=20 October 2014|publisher=}}</ref> Speaking about Jenny and Rita being reunited, Matthews said: \"Jenny doesn't see Rita initially. She meets Kevin first and so I didn't share scenes with Barbara (Knox) for a while. However, the scenes I have done with her have just been like picking up from where we left off. There is a lot of unfinished business with them\u2014Rita isn't very happy.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a626585/coronation-streets-sally-ann-matthews-talks-jenny-bradley-return.html#~p4ob6jF2A8vwgJ|title=Corrie: Sally Ann Matthews talks return|date=10 February 2015|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nWhen asked about the differences between the show now compared to your previous stint, Matthews replied: \"There were immense differences which I am used to because that is how TV is. Comparing my time then and my time now, the main difference is that we don't rehearse anymore. In the old days, we would spend all of Monday afternoon, all of Tuesday and all of Wednesday rehearsing and then we would shoot Thursday and Friday. There were less regulars then and as a group of actors, you were together for two and a half days so even if you didn't share scenes with some people, you still knew everybody very well. Everyone knew each other much better than they do today - there are still some actors I haven't met yet this time round.\"\n\n===Relationship with Kevin Webster===\nShortly after the announcement of her return, it was announced that Jenny would begin a relationship with [[Kevin Webster]], played by [[Michael Le Vell]]. Bosses of the show revealed details of the storyline which would see Kevin makes a connection with a mystery woman online, he decides to meet up with her and is shocked to come face-to-face with Jenny. Jenny has also turned to the online dating site after a nasty divorce and was pleased to find Kevin's face among the profiles, as she reveals that she had a crush on him when they were younger. Kevin and Jenny then strike a relationship after a successful meeting. Speaking about Jenny's dynamic with Kevin, Matthews said: \"She really likes him. She is single and is nervous about online dating. She sees him and he is somebody who is familiar. I think she probably always quite fancied him back in the day and she thinks 'why not?' She definitely is interested in Kevin but whether she is using him to get back in Weatherfield, time will tell. Whether it could be a fling that will develop, time will tell!\". Speaking about the reaction to them as a couple, she went on to say: \"People don't react very well to them at all. We just had some scripts in and there is a brilliant hour-long episode coming up with Sally. I love the way her character has developed into this incredible job and I love what she is doing because it's hilarious. That is going to get Jenny's back up. Sally will obviously be very defensive of Kevin and so will Sophie. People will have heard stories and that is the interesting thing. When Jenny comes back, she meets people that she has never met before and they are nice to her but then somebody will have a word in their ear and attitudes change.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a626585/coronation-streets-sally-ann-matthews-talks-jenny-bradley-return.html#~phgZw6Mvlmi3Kb|title=Corrie: Sally Ann Matthews talks return|date=10 February 2015|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Kidnapping Jack===\nOn 19 April 2015, it was reported by ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' [[newspaper]] that an upcoming plot would see Jenny kidnap Kevin's young son Jack. The kidnapping would be the culmination of a storyline which has seen Jenny become increasingly obsessed with Jack, as she spends time looking after him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a642693/coronation-street-to-air-child-kidnapping-plot-with-jenny-bradley.html|title=Corrie to air child kidnapping plot?|date=19 April 2015|publisher=}}</ref> Discussing Jenny's kidnapping of Jack plan, Matthews explained: \"I've not played it as premeditated at all. I don't believe that Jenny has planned any of it. You've got to remember that when Jack's childminder was ill a few weeks ago, Jenny was very reluctant to look after Jack. You've got to remember that she really didn't want to get involved. As soon as she did, she tried to break it off with Kevin. Kevin assumed that she was breaking it off because she thought that Rita was uncomfortable with their relationship. It wasn't that - it was just that her past was starting to come into her head and she didn't know what to do with it. That's the beginning of where we're going to go with this storyline. Jenny did have a child who died in the past. We are now going to see the consequences of that with what Jenny is going to do. She's got a deluded idea that she has to run off with Jack in order to keep him safe, so she's going to be very conflicted. She's totally lost it.\" Matthews also admitted that she is nervous about how fans may react when they see Jenny's unstable behaviour escalate. She laughed: \"Sometimes the public assume you are that person. It was bad enough when Jenny slapped [[Maria Connor|Maria]], God knows what it's going to be like now! I'll have to start putting Jenny's dark wig on, But there is a genuine reason why Jenny is behaving the way she is. I'm not playing it that she's a 'nutter'. Because of that, when it all finally comes out, I think there could be some understanding.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a648982/coronation-streets-sally-ann-matthews-on-kidnap-plot-jenny-is-deluded.html#~phgUEld2FyqP2K|title=Corrie star explains child kidnap plot|date=23 May 2015|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nProducer [[Coronation Street|Stuart Blackburn]] also offered his thoughts on the storyline, praising Matthews for exploring the difficult subject matter with sensitivity. He said: \"I think why the story is working is the way Sally Ann is playing it. I've never considered that character a 'nutter'. She's a terribly damaged woman whose life stopped the day her child died. She's just been unable, however hard she tries, to move away from that.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/coronation-street/a648982/coronation-streets-sally-ann-matthews-on-kidnap-plot-jenny-is-deluded/||date=23 May 2015|title=Coronation Street's Sally Ann Matthews on kidnap plot: 'Jenny is deluded'|first=Daniel|last=Kilkelly|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=1 April 2020|}}</ref>\n\n===Relationship with Johnny Connor===\nOn 8 February 2016, [[Richard Hawley (actor)|Richard Hawley]], who portrays the character of [[Johnny Connor (Coronation Street)|Johnny Connor]], revealed in an interview on ''[[Good Morning Britain (2014 TV programme)|Good Morning Britain]]'' that Johnny would embark on a relationship with Jenny. Hawley admitted that he was surprised about the storyline as he thought Johnny would more likely begin a romance with [[Liz McDonald]], portrayed by [[Beverley Callard]]. He went on to say \"It's interesting what is going to happen between Johnny and Jenny. He is a sucker for vulnerability and she's getting a hard time at the factory from all the workers at the moment. He has a very vulnerable side too. So in a way, I think they are both good for each other. They both want a fresh start and I think this will mark a new dawn for them.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/642049/Coronation-Street-Richard-Hawley-Johnny-Connor-Jenny-Bradley-romance|title=Coronation Street's Richard Hawley confirms Johnny Connor and Jenny Bradley romance|first=Adam|last=Miller|date=8 February 2016|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/tv/coronation-street-jenny-bradley-corrie-10860389|title=Coronation Street spoilers: Unlikely romance for Johnny Connor and Jenny Bradley|first=Katie|last=Fitzpatrick|date=8 February 2016|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2016, it was announced that an upcoming storyline would see Jenny return to [[Blackpool]] along with Johnny for a holiday together, the last time she was there was when her father [[Alan Bradley (Coronation Street)|Alan Bradley]] ([[Mark Eden]]) was killed by an oncoming tram in 1989. Discussing how Jenny feels about her father's death after all these years, Matthews said: \"It still haunts her because she's back on the street and people are talking about Blackpool and it just makes those feelings a bit stronger.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-05-10/coronation-street-sally-ann-matthews-on-her-blackpool-tram-stunt---and-jennys-romance-with-johnny|title=Coronation Street: Sally Ann Matthews on her Blackpool tram stunt - and Jenny's romance with Johnny!|newspaper=RadioTimes|access-date=2017-02-11|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2018, it was reported by ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' that Jenny and Johnny would become the new owners of the ''[[Rovers Return Inn]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/coronation-street/news/a860803/coronation-streets-new-rovers-return-owner-is-revealed/|title=Coronation Street's new Rovers Return owner is revealed|date=3 July 2018|publisher=}}</ref> Matthews said: \"Jenny is pretty adaptable.

She made her first appearance on-screen on 6 January 1986. Originally fostered by [[Rita Sullivan|Rita Fairclough]] ([[Barbara Knox]]), she has been featured in storylines including her troubled relationship with her father and Rita's partner, [[Alan Bradley (Coronation Street)|Alan Bradley]] ([[Mark Eden]]), his death when he is killed in a tram accident after chasing Rita in [[Blackpool]], and a brief underage romance with married man Robert Weston ([[Philip Bretherton]]). Their separation in 1991 led to Jenny leaving Weatherfield on 1 March 1991.\n\nShe returns for a short stint on 17 September 1993 when she visits Rita for money, but Rita's rejection of her results in Jenny leaving again on 8 October 1993. Jenny returned for four months from 18 February 2015 after meeting [[Kevin Webster]] ([[Michael Le Vell]]) through [[online dating]], and they begin a relationship. She is seen to develop an obsession with his young son [[Jack Webster (Coronation Street)|Jack]] (Jaxon and Maddox Beswick), which culminates in Jenny abducting him before being found in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], where she is arrested by police leading to her  departure on 15 June 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=Corrie Sally Ann Matthews says she was bombarded by death threats after child snatch story|publisher=[[Daily Mirror]]|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/corrie-sally-ann-matthews-says-5919542|first=Nigel|last=Pauley|date=20 June 2015|accessdate=30 June 2015}}</ref> On 11 August 2015, the official ''Coronation Street'' [[Twitter]] page announced that Jenny would be returning on 27 January 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/itvcorrie/status/631085811006631937|title=Coronation Street on Twitter|publisher=}}</ref> Although upon her return she is portrayed as a [[tragic character]], Jenny has somewhat become more comedic. She married [[Johnny Connor (Coronation Street)|Johnny Connor]] ([[Richard Hawley (actor)|Richard Hawley]]) in 2017 and her storylines since then have revolved around their relationship and she is often caught up in the family issues. Jenny and Johnny have since become the [[landlords]] of the [[Rovers Return Inn]].\n\n==Storylines==\n\n===1986\u20131993===\nJenny was fostered by Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox), following the death of her mother, Pat, in a road accident. Her father, Alan Bradley (Mark Eden), was traced after being absent for six years and re-entered her life. Although she initially felt bitter towards him, they soon bonded as he settled into No. 7 with Rita.\n\nAged seventeen, Jenny ran off to France with [[Martin Platt]] and met a medical student, Patrice Podevin (Franck Dubosc), and fell in love with him. Patrice followed her back to the UK and they got engaged, though Patrice promised Alan that he would wait until he had finished his studies before they got married. However, after he discovered that Jenny had kissed another man at a party, Patrice called off the engagement and returned to France. In 1989, on the Eve of her eighteenth birthday, Jenny stops Alan suffocating Rita but continues to stand by her father regardless, although she was torn between her loyalty to him and her love for Rita. Due to his trial plea, he is allowed to walk free but returns and starts stalking Rita, causing her to have a [[mental breakdown|breakdown]] and losing her memory. Rita moves to [[Blackpool]], but her absence makes many residents think Alan has killed her, and he becomes the object of widespread hatred and suspicion. Alan soon tracks Rita down but dies after being [[Coronation Street timeline#1989|hit and killed by a tram]] while chasing a distressed Rita across the tracks. Jenny blames Rita for his death and begins to study Biology at [[Manchester Metropolitan University|Weatherfield Polytechnic]] the following year. During this time, Rita moves into a flat on the other side of the street and rents the house to Jenny and her friend, Flick Khan ([[Rita Wolf]]), also a student at the Polytechnic. Jenny drops out of her course after becoming bored and starts an affair with a married dentist, Robert Weston ([[Philip Bretherton]]). When he leaves his wife, she moves in with him but the relationship does not last very long, and in 1991, Robert went back to his wife and Jenny left the street. In 1993 Jenny visited Rita and asked her for \u00a330,000 to start a beauty salon but Rita gave her \u00a31,000 and threw her out of her home. Jenny later marries a man named Mr. Midgeley and they had a son named Tom, who drowns in a paddling pool. Jenny left him unattended while she went inside to get her handbag for money to buy him an ice cream from the ice cream van. Tom was four years old when he died.<ref>{{cite web|title=Soap spoilers: Coronation Street kidnap, EastEnders discovery, Emmerdale returnee, Hollyoaks kiss|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a651319/soap-spoilers-coronation-street-kidnap-eastenders-discovery-emmerdale-returnee-hollyoaks-kiss.html#~peWZe9LQdVyYg8|first=Sophie|last=Dainty|author2=Kilkelly, Daniel|date=7 June 2015|accessdate=7 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===2015\u2013===\nJenny is revealed to be the woman [[Kevin Webster]] ([[Michael Le Vell]]) has been talking to on a dating website. Kevin asks her to come to [[Rovers Return Inn|The Rovers Return Inn]], but she told him that she wanted to put the past behind her and wondered how Rita would react to seeing her again. Later that month, Rita and Jenny met in The Rovers. Rita was distraught and Jenny stormed out of the pub because of [[Norris Cole (Coronation Street)|Norris Cole]]'s ([[Malcolm Hebden]]) nasty comments. Rita visited Jenny at Kevin's house and warned Jenny not to try her \"little schoolgirl tricks\". Jenny and Kevin slept together and she became obsessed with his son, [[Jack Webster (Coronation Street)|Jack]] (Jaxon and Maddox Beswick). Kevin's 20-year-old daughter, [[Sophie Webster]] ([[Brooke Vincent]]) becomes suspicious of Jenny and tells her girlfriend, [[Maddie Heath]] ([[Amy James-Kelly]]), and Kevin but they do not believe her. Sophie remains wary, despite Jenny's attempts to ingratiate herself. Maddie realises that Sophie was right when she goes home and finds that Jenny has packed a bag for Jack and is wearing a brunette wig. She guesses that Jenny is planning to run away with Jack and tries to stop her but Jenny pushes her over and vows that Maddie will not be leaving. Jenny mentions that she didn't mean to hurt \"Tom\", and a shaken Maddie manages to escape, only to be killed by an explosion triggered by [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]) setting fire to [[Carla Connor]]'s ([[Alison King]]) flat in Victoria Court.\n\nAfter Sophie and Kevin leave for Maddie's funeral, Jenny seizes the opportunity to abduct Jack as Kevin agrees that Jenny should look after him, leaving the Websters distraught. She takes him to a flat in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] and throws a birthday party in her dead son's memory. He had died aged four in April 2013 after apparently being left unsupervised in a paddling pool&nbsp;\u2013 with Jenny believing that Jack can take his place. When she notices Jack is not participating, she shouts at him and sends him to his room; Jenny is seen on the flat's balcony later with Jack, releasing balloons into the sky. Rita arrives after a tearful Jenny phoned her, asking her to visit. Rita visits, bringing Kevin and Sophie, but Jenny is enraged as she asked her to come alone. Sophie tells Jenny to bring Jack down but Jenny refuses, disturbed by her grief at losing Tom. Kevin tries to reason with her Jenny returns Jack and prepares to jump, feeling she has nothing to live for. As the police arrive, she breaks down in tears and says that she doesn't know who she is anymore, before she is arrested and brought down. She apologises to Kevin but he is no mood to listen and she is led away into a police car. The next day, Jenny is sectioned under the [[Mental Health Act 1983]]. In January 2016, Jenny contacts Rita through [[Facebook]]. Rita visits Jenny, who tells her she has changed and got a new flat. However, when Jenny runs away, Rita sees the state of Jenny's flat and allows her to stay with her; to the annoyance of Sophie and Kevin.\n\nShe later sparks a romance with [[Johnny Connor (Coronation Street)|Johnny Connor]] ([[Richard Hawley (actor)|Richard Hawley]]) and he takes her to [[Blackpool]] for her to say goodbye to her father on the anniversary of his death. Kevin and his friend [[Tim Metcalfe (Coronation Street)|Tim Metcalfe]] ([[Joe Duttine]]) have taken Jack to Blackpool as well. He runs from them and Jenny saves him from being hit by a tram, earning everyone's respect again. A few days later, once she has appeared in the newspaper; Jenny asks Johnny if she can get a job as a machinist to which he agrees. After work, he goes to teach her and Jenny flirts with him. Lead on by this, Johnny tries kissing Jenny but she pulls away. She still continues to flirt with him, however, meaning that she could be using him or she's \"playing hard to get\". Johnny later proposes to her.<ref>{{Citation|last=Coronation Street|title=Johnny Proposes To Jenny - Coronation Street|date=2017-01-06|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FTlYydI324|accessdate=2017-02-11}}</ref> They split up briefly but reconcile when Johnny tells her about his [[multiple sclerosis]]. On Jenny's hen night, Rita collapses and is taken to hospital and Jenny is upset when [[Gemma Winter]] (Dolly-Rose Campbell) tells her that Rita has been suffering from memory loss. The next day, Jenny and Johnny are unsure whether to go through with the wedding but they decide to get married and go to the venue on motorbikes. After Sally Metcalfe realised that nobody is there to give her away, she decides to do it. Later, Jenny and Johnny say their vows but realise they can't do it without Rita's presence and go to the hospital to get married there. Jenny and Johnny's new life as newlyweds doesn't go off to a great start when they find the factory empty of furniture and even without the roof intact. Upon learning that Johnny's son [[Aidan Connor]]'s ([[Shayne Ward]]) fianc\u00e9e [[Eva Price]] ([[Catherine Tyldesley]]) is responsible as revenge for Aidan's affair with [[Maria Connor]] ([[Samia Longchambon]]), they ultimately disown Aidan and eventually report Eva to the police. In time, however, Jenny and Johnny forgive Aidan and plan to move to [[Spain]] for a new life in the sun. However, a few days before they are due to leave, Aidan commits [[suicide]] and the Connor family is left distraught.\n\nJenny later finds out that Johnny had an affair with [[Liz McDonald]] ([[Beverley Callard]]) although she forgives him as he was grieving for Aidan. She, however, grows paranoid, drinks alone and puts a tracker onto Liz's phone. After Johnny finds out, they argue and Jenny falls down the stairs, leading Gemma to believe that Johnny is abusing Jenny. On Christmas Day 2018, an upset Jenny gets drunk and accidentally runs over Liz with Johnny's car. Johnny initially takes the blame but Jenny tells Liz as she cannot bare the thought of Johnny going to prison. Liz tells the police and they are both arrested. After this, Jenny starts to shut herself away and starts drinking heavily again. However, on the day of the trial, Liz changes her mind about going and instead goes on holiday, with the help of Gemma, who Jenny now sees as family. The next day, Jenny and Johnny have a heart-to-heart about their marriage when he quizzes her on her drinking. They both later realise how much they love and need each other, agreeing to put the last few months behind them.\n\n==Development==\n===Departure and brief return===\nMatthews decided to leave the programme in late 1990 and made her last appearance on 1 March 1991, in which Jenny moved in with married dentist Robert Weston. Matthews chose to leave in order to prove herself as an actress: \"I hadn't been to drama school, I am northern and I had been in a soap. People used to say 'she's just a soap actress' and I would think 'no, she's an actress'. I thought I would go and do lots of regional theatre to earn my stripes and gain respect as a result.\"\n\nIn 1993, Matthews accepted an offer to return as Jenny for ten episodes. Matthews hoped that by showcasing an older Jenny she could change casting directors' perceptions of her. Matthews: \"I was still getting offered rebellious teenage roles and I was 23. I thought I would go back so people could see I was older now and it worked.\" Jenny's departure scenes aired in October 1993. Matthews was subsequently asked to return, but declined due to fear of typecasting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/coronation-street/news/a626585/coronation-streets-sally-ann-matthews-talks-jenny-bradley-return/|title=Corrie: Sally Ann Matthews talks return|date=10 February 2015|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Reintroduction===\nMatthews' feelings towards returning to ''Coronation Street'' changed four years before the next invitation came. On 4 October 2014, it was reported that Matthews was in talks about returning to the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a601241/sally-ann-matthews-in-talks-to-return-to-coronation-street.html|title=Jenny Bradley to return to Corrie?|date=4 October 2014|publisher=}}</ref> It was then announced on 20 October 2014 that Jenny would be making a return to the show in February 2015. Matthews said: \"It was only in 2010\u2014when the 50th celebrations started and I was asked to do this and that\u2014that I thought, \u2018I\u2019m never going to get away from it, people still recognise me from it, I\u2019m dead proud I was in it, I should embrace it. So, that is when I started to feel differently about it and when they rang and asked me this time I said yes.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-02-10/coronation-street-spoilers-no-ones-pleased-to-see-jenny-bradley-reveals-sally-ann-matthews|title=Coronation Street spoilers: No one's pleased to see Jenny Bradley, reveals Sally Ann Matthews|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a604688/coronation-street-boss-confirms-jenny-bradley-return.html#~oTfc9NE1EWqF5T|title=Corrie boss confirms Jenny Bradley return|date=20 October 2014|publisher=}}</ref> Speaking about Jenny and Rita being reunited, Matthews said: \"Jenny doesn't see Rita initially. She meets Kevin first and so I didn't share scenes with Barbara (Knox) for a while. However, the scenes I have done with her have just been like picking up from where we left off. There is a lot of unfinished business with them\u2014Rita isn't very happy.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a626585/coronation-streets-sally-ann-matthews-talks-jenny-bradley-return.html#~p4ob6jF2A8vwgJ|title=Corrie: Sally Ann Matthews talks return|date=10 February 2015|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nWhen asked about the differences between the show now compared to your previous stint, Matthews replied: \"There were immense differences which I am used to because that is how TV is. Comparing my time then and my time now, the main difference is that we don't rehearse anymore. In the old days, we would spend all of Monday afternoon, all of Tuesday and all of Wednesday rehearsing and then we would shoot Thursday and Friday. There were less regulars then and as a group of actors, you were together for two and a half days so even if you didn't share scenes with some people, you still knew everybody very well. Everyone knew each other much better than they do today - there are still some actors I haven't met yet this time round.\"\n\n===Relationship with Kevin Webster===\nShortly after the announcement of her return, it was announced that Jenny would begin a relationship with [[Kevin Webster]], played by [[Michael Le Vell]]. Bosses of the show revealed details of the storyline which would see Kevin makes a connection with a mystery woman online, he decides to meet up with her and is shocked to come face-to-face with Jenny. Jenny has also turned to the online dating site after a nasty divorce and was pleased to find Kevin's face among the profiles, as she reveals that she had a crush on him when they were younger. Kevin and Jenny then strike a relationship after a successful meeting. Speaking about Jenny's dynamic with Kevin, Matthews said: \"She really likes him. She is single and is nervous about online dating. She sees him and he is somebody who is familiar. I think she probably always quite fancied him back in the day and she thinks 'why not?' She definitely is interested in Kevin but whether she is using him to get back in Weatherfield, time will tell. Whether it could be a fling that will develop, time will tell!\". Speaking about the reaction to them as a couple, she went on to say: \"People don't react very well to them at all. We just had some scripts in and there is a brilliant hour-long episode coming up with Sally. I love the way her character has developed into this incredible job and I love what she is doing because it's hilarious. That is going to get Jenny's back up. Sally will obviously be very defensive of Kevin and so will Sophie. People will have heard stories and that is the interesting thing. When Jenny comes back, she meets people that she has never met before and they are nice to her but then somebody will have a word in their ear and attitudes change.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a626585/coronation-streets-sally-ann-matthews-talks-jenny-bradley-return.html#~phgZw6Mvlmi3Kb|title=Corrie: Sally Ann Matthews talks return|date=10 February 2015|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Kidnapping Jack===\nOn 19 April 2015, it was reported by ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' [[newspaper]] that an upcoming plot would see Jenny kidnap Kevin's young son Jack. The kidnapping would be the culmination of a storyline which has seen Jenny become increasingly obsessed with Jack, as she spends time looking after him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a642693/coronation-street-to-air-child-kidnapping-plot-with-jenny-bradley.html|title=Corrie to air child kidnapping plot?|date=19 April 2015|publisher=}}</ref> Discussing Jenny's kidnapping of Jack plan, Matthews explained: \"I've not played it as premeditated at all. I don't believe that Jenny has planned any of it. You've got to remember that when Jack's childminder was ill a few weeks ago, Jenny was very reluctant to look after Jack. You've got to remember that she really didn't want to get involved. As soon as she did, she tried to break it off with Kevin. Kevin assumed that she was breaking it off because she thought that Rita was uncomfortable with their relationship. It wasn't that - it was just that her past was starting to come into her head and she didn't know what to do with it. That's the beginning of where we're going to go with this storyline. Jenny did have a child who died in the past. We are now going to see the consequences of that with what Jenny is going to do. She's got a deluded idea that she has to run off with Jack in order to keep him safe, so she's going to be very conflicted. She's totally lost it.\" Matthews also admitted that she is nervous about how fans may react when they see Jenny's unstable behaviour escalate. She laughed: \"Sometimes the public assume you are that person. It was bad enough when Jenny slapped [[Maria Connor|Maria]], God knows what it's going to be like now! I'll have to start putting Jenny's dark wig on, But there is a genuine reason why Jenny is behaving the way she is. I'm not playing it that she's a 'nutter'. Because of that, when it all finally comes out, I think there could be some understanding.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a648982/coronation-streets-sally-ann-matthews-on-kidnap-plot-jenny-is-deluded.html#~phgUEld2FyqP2K|title=Corrie star explains child kidnap plot|date=23 May 2015|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nProducer [[Coronation Street|Stuart Blackburn]] also offered his thoughts on the storyline, praising Matthews for exploring the difficult subject matter with sensitivity. He said: \"I think why the story is working is the way Sally Ann is playing it. I've never considered that character a 'nutter'. She's a terribly damaged woman whose life stopped the day her child died. She's just been unable, however hard she tries, to move away from that.\"{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n===Relationship with Johnny Connor===\nOn 8 February 2016, [[Richard Hawley (actor)|Richard Hawley]], who portrays the character of [[Johnny Connor (Coronation Street)|Johnny Connor]], revealed in an interview on ''[[Good Morning Britain (2014 TV programme)|Good Morning Britain]]'' that Johnny would embark on a relationship with Jenny. Hawley admitted that he was surprised about the storyline as he thought Johnny would more likely begin a romance with [[Liz McDonald]], portrayed by [[Beverley Callard]]. He went on to say \"It's interesting what is going to happen between Johnny and Jenny. He is a sucker for vulnerability and she's getting a hard time at the factory from all the workers at the moment. He has a very vulnerable side too. So in a way, I think they are both good for each other. They both want a fresh start and I think this will mark a new dawn for them.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/642049/Coronation-Street-Richard-Hawley-Johnny-Connor-Jenny-Bradley-romance|title=Coronation Street's Richard Hawley confirms Johnny Connor and Jenny Bradley romance|first=Adam|last=Miller|date=8 February 2016|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/tv/coronation-street-jenny-bradley-corrie-10860389|title=Coronation Street spoilers: Unlikely romance for Johnny Connor and Jenny Bradley|first=Katie|last=Fitzpatrick|date=8 February 2016|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2016, it was announced that an upcoming storyline would see Jenny return to [[Blackpool]] along with Johnny for a holiday together, the last time she was there was when her father [[Alan Bradley (Coronation Street)|Alan Bradley]] ([[Mark Eden]]) was killed by an oncoming tram in 1989. Discussing how Jenny feels about her father's death after all these years, Matthews said: \"It still haunts her because she's back on the street and people are talking about Blackpool and it just makes those feelings a bit stronger.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-05-10/coronation-street-sally-ann-matthews-on-her-blackpool-tram-stunt---and-jennys-romance-with-johnny|title=Coronation Street: Sally Ann Matthews on her Blackpool tram stunt - and Jenny's romance with Johnny!|newspaper=RadioTimes|access-date=2017-02-11|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2018, it was reported by ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' that Jenny and Johnny would become the new owners of the ''[[Rovers Return Inn]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/coronation-street/news/a860803/coronation-streets-new-rovers-return-owner-is-revealed/|title=Coronation Street's new Rovers Return owner is revealed|date=3 July 2018|publisher=}}</ref> Matthews said: \"Jenny is pretty adaptable.

It aired an [[analog television|analog]] signal on UHF channel 26 leasing space on the tower of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WWAY]] in [[unincorporated area#United States|unincorporated]] Brunswick County. The station was originally owned by Wilmington Telecasters, a company owned by [[Robinson O. Everett|Robinson]] and Katherine Everett of [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]]. The station originally operated from studios located at 1926 Oleander Drive/[[U.S. Route 76 in North Carolina|US 76]] in Wilmington. \n\nPrior to WJKA's start-up, Wilmington was one of the few [[media market|markets]] in the United States without its own CBS affiliate and one of the few in the [[Eastern Time Zone]] without full network service. Future sister station WECT had a secondary CBS affiliation until [[cable television|cable]] arrived in the area in the 1970s while [[Florence, South Carolina]]'s [[WBTW]] covered most of the market with a Grade B signal. From the 1970s until WJKA's sign-on, most local cable systems in the market carried [[Greenville, North Carolina|Greenville]] affiliate [[WNCT-TV]] or WBTW while [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]] affiliate [[WTVD]] (now an ABC owned-and-operated station) was carried by some cable providers.\n\nChannel 26's tenure as a CBS affiliate was far from successful. The station operated on a shoestring budget. It mostly served as a \"pass-through\" for automated CBS programming, and produced almost no local content. The fact that WNCT and WBTW provided at least Grade B coverage to some parts of the market did not help matters either. Further complicating matters, Raleigh's [[WRAL-TV]] (now an NBC affiliate), which had been available on cable in Wilmington for decades, switched from ABC to CBS a year after WJKA's sign-on. This move forced the fledgling station to compete against three of the strongest CBS affiliates in the [[Southeastern United States]]. Under those circumstances, WJKA barely registered as a blip in the local [[Nielsen ratings]] against rivals WECT and WWAY.\n\nIn 1994, WJKA along with sister station [[KECY-TV]] in [[El Centro, California]]\u2013[[Yuma, Arizona]] [[1994\u20131996 United States broadcast TV realignment|switched their affiliations to Fox]]; while this occurred shortly after [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] lost broadcasting rights of the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[National Football Conference]] to [[Fox NFL|Fox]] and before the [[1995 Carolina Panthers season|inaugural season]] of the [[Carolina Panthers]] the following year, the change followed several disputes between Robinson O. Everett and CBS (including one over a planned upgrade of KECY's [[KDFX-CD|translator]] in [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] to a full-power station).<ref name=v-wjkafox>{{cite news|last=Flint|first=Joe|title=CBS loses trio of affils to Fox|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR120188/?refcatid=14|accessdate=January 16, 2013|newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=April 14, 1994}}</ref> On September 18, channel 26 changed its call letters to the current '''WSFX-TV'''.\n\n[[File:WSFX.jpg|thumb|Fox Wilmington logo on side of studio building]]\n\nBefore the switch, Wilmington was the only portion of North Carolina (and one of the few in the Eastern Time Zone) without an over-the-air Fox affiliate of its own. Until this point in time, the area's cable systems piped in the national [[Foxnet]] service or [[WLFL]] in Raleigh. As a result of WSFX's affiliation switch, Wilmington did not have an over-the-air CBS affiliate until March 2000 when [[low-power broadcasting#Television|low-powered]] [[UPN]] affiliate [[WILM-LD|WILM-LP]] switched its primary affiliation to CBS. During that time, cable systems supplemented the area with either WRAL, WNCT, or WBTW.\n\nOn paper, the loss of CBS should have put channel 26 in serious jeopardy. Fox had just begun airing a full week's worth of programming just a season earlier, but then as now, does not produce any daytime programming. WSFX thus now faced having to buy an additional 10 hours of programming per day. However, the move to Fox rejuvenated the station. Its main competition was now WLFL. Within a few years, it was one of the strongest small-market Fox affiliates in the country. Until 1996, WSFX also doubled as the Fox affiliate for the Florence\u2013[[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]] market which did not have its own affiliate (some cable systems in the Myrtle Beach area imported [[WACH]] from [[Columbia, South Carolina]] prior to WSFX's switch to Fox). In fact, the current call letters stand for '''S'''uper'''F'''o'''X''', referring to its on-air name at the time and relatively wide coverage area. Since the station's over-the-air signal does not reach Florence, the [[Pee Dee]] area had to rely on cable for Fox programming until WGSE-TV (now [[WFXB]]) in Myrtle Beach took the affiliation.\n\nIn 2003, Everett sold the station to Southeastern Media Holdings. [[Raycom Media]] then took over WSFX's operations through a shared service agreement with WECT. As part of the agreement, WSFX's operations were integrated into WECT's facility. In the late-1990s, [[Time Warner Cable]] in Lumberton began to drop Wilmington stations. This station was dropped from cable in [[Laurinburg, North Carolina|Laurinburg]] in the early to mid-1990s when it was still a CBS affiliate. WFXB is currently the only Fox affiliate offered on cable in that area. On June 27, 2011, WSFX was re-branded as \"Fox Wilmington\" and introduced a new logo. Besides sharing the same call letters, this television station and [[non-commercial educational]] radio station [[WSFX (FM)|WSFX-FM]] 89.1 in [[Nanticoke, Pennsylvania]] have no other relation to each other.\n\nOn May 8, 2008, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) announced five stations in Wilmington (including WSFX) had agreed to voluntarily cease analog broadcasting on September 8. The Wilmington market was billed as the first in the nation to convert to all-digital transmissions due to its role as the FCC's digital transition test market. [[Hawaii]] shut down analog broadcasting in January 2009 followed by more but not all full-power television broadcasters on February 17, 2009.\n\n==Digital channels==\nThe station's digital signal is [[multiplex (TV)|multiplexed]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The northern and western areas of [[Robeson County, North Carolina|Robeson County]] ([[St. Pauls, North Carolina|St. Pauls]], [[Parkton, North Carolina|Parkton]], and [[Red Springs, North Carolina|Red Springs]]) also do not carry WSFX even though its translator was located in Lumber Bridge. The repeater had a directional signal covering Robeson County fairly well and could also be seen as far north as [[Raeford, North Carolina|Raeford]] in [[Hoke County, North Carolina|Hoke County]] and [[Hope Mills, North Carolina|Hope Mills]] in [[Cumberland County, North Carolina|Cumberland County]] in the Raleigh/Durham market.\n\n==Programming==\n[[television syndication|Syndicated]] programming on WSFX includes ''[[Maury (talk show)|Maury]]'', ''[[Modern Family]]'', ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'', and ''[[Family Feud]]'' among others.\n\n==News operation==\n[[File:WECT and WSFX.jpg|thumb|The WECT and WSFX shared studio in Wilmington, North Carolina]]\nAs WJKA, the station had virtually no news department for most of its tenure as a CBS affiliate. In the mid-1980s, it did air a weekday noon show called ''Midday'' offering local news headlines and entertainment reports. In the early-1990s, WJKA actually operated a short-lived news department branded as ''WJKA [[Action News]] 26''. It attempted to create another source for newscasts besides longtime dominant WECT and runner up WWAY. Despite the efforts of WJKA and WWAY, WECT maintained a strong lead in the market ratings and viewership counts by consistently holding the top spot in Nielsen marks.\n\nOn September 22, 2003 through a new share agreement, WECT began producing a nightly half-hour prime time newscast on WSFX called ''Fox 26 News at 10'' (now ''Fox Wilmington News at 10''). This was eventually joined by an sixty-minute extension of WECT's weekday morning show on September 13, 2006 called ''Carolina in the Morning on Fox 26'' (now ''Carolina in the Morning on Fox Wilmington''), currently airing from 7 until 8 on WSFX offering an alternative to the national morning shows seen on the market's [[Big Three television networks|big three network]]-affiliated stations. On August 31, 2008, WECT became Wilmington's first television outlet to upgrade local news production to high definition level and the broadcasts on WSFX were included in the change. \n\nAt some point in time, WECT added a third newscast to WSFX called ''Fox 26 News at 6:30'' (later became ''Fox Wilmington News at 6:30''), which only aired on weeknights and attempted to compete against the [[ABC World News Tonight|national]] [[CBS Evening News|evening]] [[NBC Nightly News|newscasts]] seen on the big three networks. It would be canceled by the end of 2013 in preparation to expand the weeknight edition of the 10 o'clock show to an hour (which occurred on January 15, 2014). On September 6, 2016, WSFX premiered a 7 p.m. newscast. After WWAY stopped producing weekend evening newscasts on August 1, 2009, WECT and WSFX became the only outlets in Wilmington to offer evening broadcasts seen seven nights a week. Although WWAY eventually reintroduced a local newscast airing Sunday nights at 11, WECT and WSFX remain the only channels in the market to air newscasts throughout the weekend. \n\nWSFX currently airs 13\u00bd hours of news produced by sister station WECT. All newscasts on WSFX air from WECT's primary set but with modified [[duratrans]] indicating the Fox-branded shows.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|https://foxwilmington.revrocket.us}}\n*[http://wilmington.thistv.com/ WSFX-DT2 This TV]\n*[https://www.wect.com/ WECT]\n*{{TVQ|WSFX-TV}}\n\n{{Wilmington TV}}\n{{Fox North Carolina}}\n{{Gray TV}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wsfx-Tv}}\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1984]]\n[[Category:1984 establishments in North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Television stations in Wilmington, North Carolina|SFX-TV]]\n[[Category:Fox network affiliates]]\n[[Category:Ion Television subchannel-only affiliates]]\n[[Category:Grit (TV network) affiliates]]\n[[Category:Gray Television]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Fox affiliate in Wilmington, North Carolina}}\n{{Infobox broadcast \n| call_letters             = WSFX-TV\n| station_logo             = [[File:Wsfx 2009.png|150px]]\n| station_slogan           = \n| station_branding         = Fox Wilmington ''(general)''<br>''[[WECT]] News'' ''(newscasts)''\n| analog                   = \n| digital                  = 29 ([[ultra high frequency|UHF]])\n| virtual                  = 26 ([[Program and System Information Protocol|PSIP]])\n| other_chs                = \n| subchannels              = \n| affiliations             = {{ubl|'''26.1:''' [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] (1994\u2013present)|'''26.2:''' [Blank] \u2192 [[Court TV]] (soon)|'''26.3:''' [[Grit (TV network)|Grit]]|'''26.4:''' [[Ion Television]]}}\n| founded                  = \n| airdate                  = {{Start date and age|1984|09|24|p=y}}\n| location                 = [[Wilmington, North Carolina]]\n| country                  = United States\n| callsign_meaning         = '''W'''e're '''S'''uper '''F'''o'''X'''<br>(former branding)\n| former_callsigns         = WJKA (1984\u20131994)\n| former_channel_numbers   = '''[[analog television|Analog]]:'''<br>26 (UHF, 1984\u20132008)<br>'''Digital:'''<br>30 (UHF, until 2020)<br>'''''Translator:'''<br>19 W19CA [[Lumberton, North Carolina|Lumberton]]''\n| owner                    = {{nowrap|[[American Spirit Media]], [[Limited liability company|LLC]]}}\n| licensee                 = WSFX License Subsidiary, LLC\n| operator                 = [[Gray Television]]<br>''(via [[shared services|SSA]])''\n| sister_stations          = [[WECT]], [[WMBF-TV]], [[WBTV]] ([[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]])\n| former_affiliations      = '''Analog/DT1:'''<br>[[CBS]] (1984\u20131994)<br>'''DT2:'''<br>[[This TV]] (until 2020)\n| effective_radiated_power = 200 [[kilowatt|kW]]\n| HAAT                     = {{convert|590|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}\n| facility_id              = 72871\n| class                    = [[digital terrestrial television|DT]]\n| coordinates              = {{nowrap|{{coord|34|7|54|N|78|11|16|W|type:landmark_scale:2000}}}}\n| licensing_authority      = [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]]\n| homepage                 = {{URL|https://foxwilmington.revrocket.us/}}\n}}\n\n'''WSFX-TV''', [[virtual channel]] 26 ([[ultra high frequency|UHF]] [[digital terrestrial television|digital]] channel 29), is a [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]-[[network affiliate|affiliated]] [[television station]] [[city of license|licensed]] to [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]], [[North Carolina]], United States and serving the [[Cape Fear (region)|Cape Fear region]].

[[Raycom Media]] then took over WSFX's operations through a shared service agreement with WECT. As part of the agreement, WSFX's operations were integrated into WECT's facility. In the late-1990s, [[Time Warner Cable]] in Lumberton began to drop Wilmington stations. This station was dropped from cable in [[Laurinburg, North Carolina|Laurinburg]] in the early to mid-1990s when it was still a CBS affiliate. WFXB is currently the only Fox affiliate offered on cable in that area. On June 27, 2011, WSFX was re-branded as \"Fox Wilmington\" and introduced a new logo. Besides sharing the same call letters, this television station and [[non-commercial educational]] radio station [[WSFX (FM)|WSFX-FM]] 89.1 in [[Nanticoke, Pennsylvania]] have no other relation to each other.\n\nOn May 8, 2008, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) announced five stations in Wilmington (including WSFX) had agreed to voluntarily cease analog broadcasting on September 8. The Wilmington market was billed as the first in the nation to convert to all-digital transmissions due to its role as the FCC's digital transition test market. [[Hawaii]] shut down analog broadcasting in January 2009 followed by more but not all full-power television broadcasters on February 17, 2009.\n\n==Digital channels==\nThe station's digital signal is [[multiplex (TV)|multiplexed]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The northern and western areas of [[Robeson County, North Carolina|Robeson County]] ([[St. Pauls, North Carolina|St. Pauls]], [[Parkton, North Carolina|Parkton]], and [[Red Springs, North Carolina|Red Springs]]) also do not carry WSFX even though its translator was located in Lumber Bridge. The repeater had a directional signal covering Robeson County fairly well and could also be seen as far north as [[Raeford, North Carolina|Raeford]] in [[Hoke County, North Carolina|Hoke County]] and [[Hope Mills, North Carolina|Hope Mills]] in [[Cumberland County, North Carolina|Cumberland County]] in the Raleigh/Durham market.\n\n==Programming==\n[[television syndication|Syndicated]] programming on WSFX includes ''[[Maury (talk show)|Maury]]'', ''[[Modern Family]]'', ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'', and ''[[Family Feud]]'' among others.\n\n==News operation==\n[[File:WECT and WSFX.jpg|thumb|The WECT and WSFX shared studio in Wilmington, North Carolina]]\nAs WJKA, the station had virtually no news department for most of its tenure as a CBS affiliate. In the mid-1980s, it did air a weekday noon show called ''Midday'' offering local news headlines and entertainment reports. In the early-1990s, WJKA actually operated a short-lived news department branded as ''WJKA [[Action News]] 26''. It attempted to create another source for newscasts besides longtime dominant WECT and runner up WWAY. Despite the efforts of WJKA and WWAY, WECT maintained a strong lead in the market ratings and viewership counts by consistently holding the top spot in Nielsen marks.\n\nOn September 22, 2003 through a new share agreement, WECT began producing a nightly half-hour prime time newscast on WSFX called ''Fox 26 News at 10'' (now ''Fox Wilmington News at 10''). This was eventually joined by an sixty-minute extension of WECT's weekday morning show on September 13, 2006 called ''Carolina in the Morning on Fox 26'' (now ''Carolina in the Morning on Fox Wilmington''), currently airing from 7 until 8 on WSFX offering an alternative to the national morning shows seen on the market's [[Big Three television networks|big three network]]-affiliated stations. On August 31, 2008, WECT became Wilmington's first television outlet to upgrade local news production to high definition level and the broadcasts on WSFX were included in the change. \n\nAt some point in time, WECT added a third newscast to WSFX called ''Fox 26 News at 6:30'' (later became ''Fox Wilmington News at 6:30''), which only aired on weeknights and attempted to compete against the [[ABC World News Tonight|national]] [[CBS Evening News|evening]] [[NBC Nightly News|newscasts]] seen on the big three networks. It would be canceled by the end of 2013 in preparation to expand the weeknight edition of the 10 o'clock show to an hour (which occurred on January 15, 2014). On September 6, 2016, WSFX premiered a 7 p.m. newscast. After WWAY stopped producing weekend evening newscasts on August 1, 2009, WECT and WSFX became the only outlets in Wilmington to offer evening broadcasts seen seven nights a week. Although WWAY eventually reintroduced a local newscast airing Sunday nights at 11, WECT and WSFX remain the only channels in the market to air newscasts throughout the weekend. \n\nWSFX currently airs 13\u00bd hours of news produced by sister station WECT. All newscasts on WSFX air from WECT's primary set but with modified [[duratrans]] indicating the Fox-branded shows.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|https://foxwilmington.revrocket.us}}\n*[http://wilmington.thistv.com/ WSFX-DT2 This TV]\n*[https://www.wect.com/ WECT]\n*{{TVQ|WSFX-TV}}\n\n{{Wilmington TV}}\n{{Fox North Carolina}}\n{{Gray TV}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wsfx-Tv}}\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1984]]\n[[Category:1984 establishments in North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Television stations in Wilmington, North Carolina|SFX-TV]]\n[[Category:Fox network affiliates]]\n[[Category:Ion Television subchannel-only affiliates]]\n[[Category:Grit (TV network) affiliates]]\n[[Category:Gray Television]]\n", "name_user": "Scoty6776", "label": "safe", "comment": "updated listings from RabbitEars", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WSFX-TV"}
