The Leafs drafted a total of nine players. They held on to only three (rounds 4, 5, 7) of their own seven picks. On the first day of the draft they exchanged their first-round pick for a lower first-round pick held by the [[St. Louis Blues]] but did receive the Blues' third-round pick as well, their second round pick had been traded to the [[Montreal Canadiens]] in the [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Plekanec|Tomas Plekanec]] deal in February 2018, their third-round pick was given to the [[New Jersey Devils]] as compensation for signing general manager [[Lou Lamoriello]] in 2015, and their sixth-round pick had been traded to the [[Vegas Golden Knights]] in the [[Calvin Pickard]] deal in October 2017. Through various trades they acquired an additional six picks, including the first-round pick originally held by St. Louis mentioned above.\n<!-- Please do not forget to add reliable sources when listing any possible high-profile prospects -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n!

Airlines Center]] in [[Dallas, Texas]]. The Leafs drafted a total of nine players. They held on to only three (rounds 4, 5, 7) of their own seven picks. On the first day of the draft they exchanged their first-round pick for a lower first-round pick held by the [[St. Louis Blues]] but did receive the Blues' third-round pick as well, their second round pick had been traded to the [[Montreal Canadiens]] in the [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Plekanec|Tomas Plekanec]] deal in February 2018, their third-round pick was given to the [[New Jersey Devils]] as compensation for signing general manager [[Lou Lamoriello]] in 2015, and their sixth-round pick had been traded to the [[Vegas Golden Knights]] in the [[Calvin Pickard]] deal in October 2017. Through various trades they acquired an additional six picks, including the first-round pick originally held by St. Louis mentioned above.\n<!-- Please do not forget to add reliable sources when listing any possible high-profile prospects -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n!

He was a survivor of the \"[[lost generation]]\" who came of age in 1914, and was scarred, both mentally and physically, by the [[First World War]].\n\nLamb completed his training in 1915 as a right-handed artist. A war wound incapacitated his right hand, so that after the war he had to retrain as a left-hander. His urge to create was in no way diminished and his preferred medium was sculpture.\n\nLamb's most productive period was from 1924 to 1933. As a result of an education on strictly traditional lines, he developed a style of modelling that was classically accurate, but which expressed the character and background of his subject.<ref>Obituary \u2013 RSA Annual Report 1951 p6.</ref> Although he modelled [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] as Princess Elizabeth aged six, in 1932,<ref>Zealand, Gillian 1993 p33.</ref> he generally eschewed the rich, the famous and the heroic.

He became isolated and developed severe depression around 1935/36,<ref>WLC e.g. letter of 31 January 1936.</ref> turning into something of a recluse. He never escaped poverty, never married and until the publication of a biography in 2013, his work was largely forgotten outside east central Scotland.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Lamb-Lena Gaudie.jpg|left|thumb|130px|Lena Gaudie 1921.]]\n\n===Early life and training===\n\nWilliam Lamb was born on 1 June 1893 in [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]], Scotland. He was educated in the town and apprenticed into the family firm of monumental masons. His childhood was overshadowed by the alcoholism of his father. At an early age he became interested in art and attended evening classes at [[Montrose Academy]].<ref>Montrose Review of 30 May 1968 p4.</ref> He completed his apprenticeship in his craft, and then moved to Aberdeen to work and to attend [[Gray's School of Art]] (now part of [[Robert Gordon's University]]). He volunteered in 1915 and served in the [[Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders]].<ref>Enlistment Book of Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders.</ref> Lamb was wounded three times and the third wound, in August 1917 at the [[Battle of Passchendaele]], was a severe one, crippling his dominant right hand and arm. He convalesced in Montrose, and then in Edinburgh, where he received medical attention and attended [[Edinburgh College of Art]]. He learned to draw, paint, engrave and model with his left hand.<ref name=\"Atkinson, Norman K. 1979 p2\">Atkinson, Norman K. 1979 p2.</ref>\n\nIn September 1922, Lamb journeyed to Paris where he briefly attended the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux Arts]]. In summer of 1923 he toured France on a bicycle, sketching what he saw. In the autumn, he went to Rome for several weeks and also visited [[Florence]] and [[Milan]]. He returned to London before the end of the year.<ref>WLC 2 December 1923.</ref>\n\n[[File:Lamb-Ferryden Fisherwife.jpg|right|thumb|130px|Ferryden Fisherwife 1929.]]\n\n===Artistic career===\nLamb set up a studio in Montrose in 1924. He earned a livelihood initially by print making, almost all etchings,<ref>Stansfeld, John 2013 p61</ref> and by drawing. Simultaneously he started to model whenever he had time or a commission. He gradually fell under the influence of [[Hugh MacDiarmid]] and the [[Scottish Renaissance]] literary movement which was centred in Montrose. This confirmed his resolve to make his work distinctly Scottish by modelling the ordinary men and women working in the community around him. In 1929 he won the Guthrie Award for the best work shown by a young Scottish artist at the [[Royal Scottish Academy]]'s summer exhibition. The work was a bust entitled Ferryden Fisherwife.<ref>Bell, Leonard J.A. 1950 p16.</ref>\n[[File:Lamb-Princess Elizabeth.jpg|left|thumb|130px|Princess Elizabeth 1932.]]\nIn 1931 he was elected an Associate of the Royal Scottish Academy (ARSA).<ref>Hartley, Keith 1989 p141.</ref> The following year he modelled Queen Elizabeth II, as Princess Elizabeth, aged 6\u00bd, and her sister [[Princess Margaret]] Rose. These were followed in 1933 by a head of their mother, the Duchess of York, later the Queen Consort and then [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]].\n\nAfter 1930 the demand for prints declined and Lamb turn to water-colours for his bread and butter.<ref>Stansfeld, John 2013 p120</ref> After his royal commissions, he built himself a new studio, but the collapse of a personal relationship triggered a mental breakdown and his artistic output suffered. As he recovered from his depression, Lamb found that the approach of war made it difficult, and later impossible, to procure materials for modelling.<ref>WLC e.g. letter of 18 December 1942 p2.</ref> He turned to wood carving and also went back to his craft, as a monumental mason, to earn his living.\n\nFrom 1942 the artist's life became a battle between his urge to create and debilitating kidney disease. He would die of kidney failure, having worked up until two weeks before his death.\n\n==Works==\n\n===Sculpture===\n[[File:Lamb-Souwester.jpg|right|thumb|130px|Sou'wester 1947.]]\nLamb's first major work was The Cynic, a head modelled from an apprentice in 1924. It was exhibited at the [[Salon (Paris)]] in 1925 as T\u0207te de Garcon.\n\nThe Young Fisherman was exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] (RA) in London and the Young Musician (WSC) at the [[Royal Scottish Academy]] (RSA) in Edinburgh all in the same year.<ref name=\"Atkinson, Norman K. 1979 p2\"/> This trio of exhibits was unusual for an artist's first year. [[File:Lamb-Betsy Baxter.jpg|left|thumb|130px|Betsy Baxter 1937.]]In the years following, Lamb's more important works were Old John (P\u00e8re Jean Salon 1926), [[Violet Jacob]] (Doncaster 1926), Betty (Printemps Salon 1926), Purpose (RSA 1926), Self Portrait (Portrait d'un Artiste Salon 1927), Bob (Glasgow 1928), Old Salt (RSA 1927), Passing Shower (Dorothy Salon 1929), the Bud (B\u00e9b\u00e9 Jeanette Salon 1927), Hugh MacDiarmid and Pittendrigh MacGillivray (RSA 1932), Ferryden Fisherwife (RSA 1929), My Model listens to a Tall Story (RSA 1940), Paresseux (RSA 1931), Princess Elizabeth (RA 1933), Princess Margaret Rose (RSA 1933), Duchess of York (RSA 1933), The Daily News (1935), [[Robert Burns]] 1936 ([[Sunderland Museum]]), Bill the Smith (RSA 1937) [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/511995 ], Betsy Baxter (RSA 1937), Seafarer (Trawl Hand RSA 1938) and Edward Baird c1932 ([[Fleming Collection]], London 2004).\n\nWith the approach of war, Lamb turned to [[wood carving]].\n\nIn this genre, the more noteworthy works are The Beardless Christ<ref>Roberts I 1978 p388.</ref> (Five Figures set above the rood screen in the Episcopal Church of St. Mary, Newport-on-Tay), Wind frae the Baltic, Sou-Wester, The Shrew & Gale Force.\n\nAltogether 109 of Lamb's works were shown at the RSA annual exhibition 1925\u20131951. These included 84 works of sculpture, 5 prints and 20 drawings.<ref>Laperri\u00e8re, Charles B. de 1991 p7.</ref>\n\nA [[c:Category:Sculptures_by_William_Lamb|number of his works]] can be seen in the William Lamb Memorial Studio in Montrose, and elsewhere in the town. \n\n===Prints===\n[[File:Lamb-Calm Montrose.jpg|left|thumb|130px|Calm Montrose 1928.]]\nBetween 1924 and 1929 Lamb produced more than one hundred prints for the market. They are almost all etchings. Many are derived from the sketches he made in France in 1922/23 and most of the rest are of Scottish origin. There is an almost complete collection of his known prints in the William Lamb Memorial Studio in Montrose. Around 1929 the fashion for etchings came to an end and Lamb turned to water colours.\n\n===Water-colours===\n\nAlthough William Lamb relied on his prints and water-colours for much of his livelihood, his marketing skills were non-existent. This meant that he was never able to turn his talent to much advantage, or to escape from poverty. In addition to poor marketing, the artist was possessive about his water-colours.\n\nWhen he heard that a buyer was to visit, he would hide away his best works, in case the potential customer chose them.<ref>WLC e.g. letters of 29 September 1929 and 10 February 1930.</ref> Some critics have found the water-colours dull, but they are expressive of the Scottish east coast and they depict the working lives of those who live there.\n\n===Drawings===\n\nThere are almost one thousand of Lamb's drawings in the William Lamb studio. It has been said that it is worth making the trip to Montrose to see these alone.<ref>Montrose Review 25 August 1955 p4 refers.</ref> The artist's style was minimalist and he was fond of portraying effort, both in men and in horses. The collections of pencil sketches and more formal drawings cover much of his life. Sadly his sketches of World War I and his life in the trenches became lost when he was wounded in 1917.\n\n==Influences and Legacy==\n\n===Inspiration===\n[[File:Lamb-Torso II.jpg|right|thumb|130px|Torso II 1925.]]\n[[File:lamb-Hugh MacDiarmid.jpg|right|thumb|130px|[[Hugh MacDiarmid]] 1927.]]\nWilliam Lamb was fiercely independent and on occasion declared that his work was not subject to the influence of others. Nevertheless, influence can be detected throughout his work and, in moments of reflection he acknowledged this.<ref>WLC e.g. letter of 6 February 1926 p1.</ref> Firstly Lamb was an inheritor of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] and the strong classical tradition rooted at that time in the country's educational system. When he went to Rome and saw for the first time the Greek and Roman sculpture and architecture, he described them as old friends.<ref>WLD \u2013 see entry for 13 October 1923.</ref> He admired their accuracy to life, their grace and simplicity.\n\nThe second major influence was the [[Arts & Crafts Movement]], active throughout the period of his education. He completed an apprenticeship in stone carving, as a monumental mason, and attended art classes in his free time. Around 1912 he decided that art was to be paramount in his life, but this did not stop him from practising his craft when convenience or necessity made it advantageous to do so.\n[[File:Lamb-Old John.jpg|left|thumb|130px|Old John 1925.]]\nWhen Lamb went to Paris he came under the influence of [[Auguste Rodin]]. He was a frequent visitor to the [[Hotel Biron]]. Rodin also had started life as a stonemason and decorative carver.<ref>Goldscheider, Ludwig 1939.</ref> His later sculpture displayed the realism and movement that Lamb judged so important. The Scot also acknowledged his debt to the [[Italian Renaissance]] and the subsequent French schools. The First World War made Lamb distrust authority and admire art that was simple and down to earth. He was irritated by [[Academism]] and disliked the [[Baroque]] form fashionable before the war.\n\nWhen he returned to Scotland in 1924, Lamb came within the orbit of the Scottish Renaissance. This movement was largely inspired by Hugh MacDiarmid who lived at the time in Montrose near to the sculptor. The aim of this movement was to make the arts central to Scottish life.<ref>Bold, Alan 1988.</ref> The rebirth was to be rooted in the great European tradition, but should exemplify Scotland. This was to be achieved through portraying Scots working in their local community and by describing the life of ordinary people. The sculptor grew to accept this tenet and lived and worked for the rest of his life in Montrose.<ref>Bell, Leonard J.A. 1950 p19.</ref>\n\nWilliam Lamb was also a gifted draughtsman. He followed the teaching of [[:fr:Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran|Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran]] who had taught several of the French artists whom Lamb admired. The idea was to gaze at the subject for some time and commit it to visual memory. The drawing done afterwards would capture the essentials without extraneous detail. He respected [[Edmund Blampied]], a skilled draughtsman, who was exhibiting in Paris while the Scot was there. He also liked the etchings of Charles M\u00e9ryon and this artist's style influenced Lamb's prints.<ref>MMP e.g. letter to Jean Orkney Dec 1939.</ref>\n\nThe final influence upon Lamb's art was [[World War II]]. Unable to buy artists' materials, he turned to wood carving. His sculptures in this medium are anonymous and often beaten by the wind. His figures had become cogs in the machine, lashed by the winds of war.\n\n===Lamb's Legacy===\n[[File:Lamb-Bill the Smith.jpg|right|thumb|130px|Bill the Smith 1936.]]\nWith the exception of his commissions and in spite of his poverty, Lamb was reluctant to sell his work and especially anything that he thought was any good. This meant that he amassed a large and representative collection of his \u0153uvre in his Montrose studio. When he died, he left the studio and its contents to the local authority. The present owners are [[Angus Council]].\n\nThe collection has received little public attention outside east central Scotland and is virtually unknown to the wider world. Nonetheless it shows Lamb as a master, possibly the best sculptor that Scotland has produced. Apart from the sculpture, his drawings, water-colours and etchings are all remarkable. They achieve the aim of the Scottish Renaissance by illustrating the life and the countryside of the [[Scottish Lowlands]] realistically and in humble terms.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\nWLC: William Lamb's correspondence\nWLD: William Lamb's diaries\n\n==References==\n\n*{{Cite news|last=Atkinson|first=Norman K.|title=William Lamb \u2013 The Unknown Artist|publisher=Dundee's Own Christmas Annual|year=1979|location=Dundee City Library}}\n*{{Cite news|last=Bell|first=Leonard J.A.|title=The Art of William Lamb|work=The Scots Magazine|date=October 1950|pages=13\u201320|location=D.C.

This movement was largely inspired by Hugh MacDiarmid who lived at the time in Montrose near to the sculptor. The aim of this movement was to make the arts central to Scottish life.<ref>Bold, Alan 1988.</ref> The rebirth was to be rooted in the great European tradition, but should exemplify Scotland. This was to be achieved through portraying Scots working in their local community and by describing the life of ordinary people. The sculptor grew to accept this tenet and lived and worked for the rest of his life in Montrose.<ref>Bell, Leonard J.A. 1950 p19.</ref>\n\nWilliam Lamb was also a gifted draughtsman. He followed the teaching of [[:fr:Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran|Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran]] who had taught several of the French artists whom Lamb admired. The idea was to gaze at the subject for some time and commit it to visual memory. The drawing done afterwards would capture the essentials without extraneous detail. He respected [[Edmund Blampied]], a skilled draughtsman, who was exhibiting in Paris while the Scot was there. He also liked the etchings of Charles M\u00e9ryon and this artist's style influenced Lamb's prints.<ref>MMP e.g. letter to Jean Orkney Dec 1939.</ref>\n\nThe final influence upon Lamb's art was [[World War II]]. Unable to buy artists' materials, he turned to wood carving. His sculptures in this medium are anonymous and often beaten by the wind. His figures had become cogs in the machine, lashed by the winds of war.\n\n===Lamb's Legacy===\n[[File:Lamb-Bill the Smith.jpg|right|thumb|130px|Bill the Smith 1936.]]\nWith the exception of his commissions and in spite of his poverty, Lamb was reluctant to sell his work and especially anything that he thought was any good. This meant that he amassed a large and representative collection of his \u0153uvre in his Montrose studio. When he died, he left the studio and its contents to the local authority. The present owners are [[Angus Council]].\n\nThe collection has received little public attention outside east central Scotland and is virtually unknown to the wider world. Nonetheless it shows Lamb as a master, possibly the best sculptor that Scotland has produced. Apart from the sculpture, his drawings, water-colours and etchings are all remarkable. They achieve the aim of the Scottish Renaissance by illustrating the life and the countryside of the [[Scottish Lowlands]] realistically and in humble terms.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\nWLC: William Lamb's correspondence\nWLD: William Lamb's diaries\n\n==References==\n\n*{{Cite news|last=Atkinson|first=Norman K.|title=William Lamb \u2013 The Unknown Artist|publisher=Dundee's Own Christmas Annual|year=1979|location=Dundee City Library}}\n*{{Cite news|last=Bell|first=Leonard J.A.|title=The Art of William Lamb|work=The Scots Magazine|date=October 1950|pages=13\u201320|location=D.C.

In 1983, the BBC offered Fry, Laurie and Thompson their own show, which became ''[[The Crystal Cube]]'', a mixture of science fiction and [[mockumentary]] that was cancelled after the first episode. Undeterred, Fry and Laurie appeared in an episode of ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'' in 1984, and Fry also appeared in Ben Elton's 1985 ''[[Happy Families (1985 TV series)|Happy Families]]'' series.

The cost was $4 million. The plant was built to stop raw sewage from entering the [[Potomac River|Potomac]] and [[Anacostia River]]s. At that time, the plant was built to treat sewage from a population of 650,000, with a capacity of 100 million gallons per day (mgd). By 1943, the population grew to 1.5 million people, contributing much more sewage, and upgrades to the plant were necessary.<ref>Wennersten, John R. (2008).

DC Water was established as an independent agency in 1996 by the District Government and the U.S. federal government.\n\nIn 2010, under new leadership, the Authority underwent a rebranding effort. The rebranding included a new logo, new color palette, and a new name. Since its inception, the Authority had been doing business as DC Water. The legal name of the agency remains the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority.\n\n== Statistics ==\n[[File:Blue Plains WWTP - aerial 2009.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant|Blue Plains Wastewater Treatment Plant]]]]\n* Employees: 1,000 (FY 2009)\n* Service area: 725 square miles (1,880 km2)\n* Drinking water pumped: {{convert|108|e6USgal|m3}} a day (FY 2009)\n* Drinking water distribution\n** Pipes: 1,300 miles (2,100&nbsp;km)\n** Pumping Stations: 5\n** [[Reservoirs]]: 5\n** Elevated water storage tanks: 3\n** [[Valves]]: 36,000\n** Public Hydrants: 9,000+\n* [[Sewerage|Sewers]]\n** [[Sanitary]], [[Stormwater]], and [[combined sewers]]: 1,900 miles (3,060&nbsp;km)\n** Flow-metering stations: 22\n** Off-site [[wastewater]] pumping stations: 9\n* [[Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant]]\n** Largest advanced wastewater treatment plant in the world\n** {{convert|150|acre|km2}}\n** Capacity: {{convert|370|e6USgal|m3}} per day\n** Peak capacity: {{convert|1.076|e9USgal|m3}} per day.\n\n== Governance ==\nAn eleven-member [[Board of Directors]] governs DC Water. The District is represented by six Board Members. Prince George's County and Montgomery County each have two Board Members. Fairfax County has a single Board Member. Each participating jurisdiction is a signatory to the ''Blue Plains Intermunicipal Agreement,'' which spells out the roles and responsibilities for each party, and addresses facilities management, capacity allocation and financing.<ref>DC Water.

Together these two budgets are presented annually to Congress for approval.\n\nWhen DC Water was created as an independent authority in 1996, its finances were separate from those of the District of Columbia. The independence of DC Water with regard to finance, procurement and personnel matters was affirmed by Congress under the ''District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority Independence Preservation Act'' of 2008.<ref>District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority Independence Preservation Act, {{USPL|110|273}}, {{USStat|122|2491}}, approved 2008-07-15.</ref> <!-- This appears to be an orphaned ref: <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dcwater.com/news/publications/spring2010_cso_web.pdf|title=Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) Control Activities Update|date=April 2010|publisher=DC Water|accessdate=August 25, 2010}}</ref>  -->\n\n== Operations ==\n[[File:D.C.

The Aqueduct sources the water from the Potomac River at [[Great Falls (Potomac River)|Great Falls]] and Little Falls, north of the District. The Aqueduct treats the water and DC Water distributes it through {{convert|1300|mi|km}} of water pipes throughout the District of Columbia.\n\nDC Water also manages {{convert|1900|mi|km}} of sewer lines and operates the Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant.<ref>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Philadelphia, PA (2010).

The research project must be completed in-house (or by a contractor working directly with the agency) and it must relate to the collection process, treatment process, or reuse of wastewater. This innovation by the DC Water team has global impact in protecting aquatic life in waterways that receive wastewater discharges. The year 2010 marks the second consecutive year that DC Water has been recognized with this award.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nacwa.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=187%3Aresearch-a-technology-award&catid=36%3Aneaa&Itemid=62|title=Research and Technology Award|year=2010|publisher=NACWA|accessdate=September 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, DC Water received from NACWA the Platinum Peak Performance Award after receiving five consecutive Gold Awards for 100 percent compliance with permit limits. This Award is presented to member agencies for exceptional compliance for their [[National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System]] (NPDES) permit limits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nacwa.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=127&Itemid=63|title=Platinum Peak Award |year=2010 |publisher=NACWA |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Funding ==\nRates paid by ratepayers cover the cost of delivery of water and sewer service. A little more than half of the rates cover operations. Another quarter covers the cost of capital projects like replacement of aging water and sewer lines, valve replacements and pump station improvements. Capital projects also include several projects designed to protect the environment, and are required by the U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA). Though the mandate comes from the federal government, the funding sources for these construction projects are not identified. While a small amount of funding has come through the [[Clean Water Act]] and [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] and other grants, the majority of these capital costs are borne by the ratepayers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcwater.com/customercare/rates.cfm|title=Rates and Metering|year=2009|publisher=DC Water|accessdate=April 20, 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Environmental stewardship ==\nAt Blue Plains, wastewater treatment goes beyond primary and secondary treatment levels, to [[Sewage treatment#Tertiary treatment|tertiary (or advanced) treatment]]. The effluent that leaves Blue Plains and is discharged to the Potomac is highly treated and meets some of the most stringent NPDES permit limits in the United States.\n\nHistorically, wastewater treatment plants have contributed nutrients such as [[phosphorus]] and [[nitrogen]] to the waterways in which they discharge.

It was the seat of one of the earliest [[civilizations]] of [[ancient]] [[Africa]], as the [[Kerma culture]] lasted from around 2500 BCE until its conquest by the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]] under [[pharaoh]] [[Thutmose I]] around 1500 BCE. Nubia was home to several [[African empires|empires]], most prominently the [[kingdom of Kush]], which conquered Egypt during the 8th century BC during the reign of [[Piye]] and ruled the country as its [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-fifth Dynasty]] (to be replaced a century later by the native Egyptian [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-sixth Dynasty]]).\n\nThe collapse of Kush in the 4th century CE after more than a thousand years of existence was precipitated by an invasion by [[Ethiopia]]'s [[Kingdom of Aksum]] and saw the rise of three Christian kingdoms, [[Nobatia]], [[Makuria]] and [[Alodia]], the last two again lasting for roughly a millennium. Their eventual decline initiated not only the partition of Nubia into the northern half conquered by the [[Ottomans]] and the southern half by the [[Sennar (sultanate)|Sennar sultanate]] in the 16th century, but also a rapid [[Islamization]] and partial [[Arabization]] of the [[Nubian people]]. Nubia was again united with the [[Khedivate of Egypt]] in the 19th century. Today, the region of Nubia is split between Egypt and Sudan.\n\nThe primarily [[Archaeology|archaeological]] science dealing with ancient Nubia is called [[Nubiology]].\n\n==Linguistics==\n{{Main article|Nubian languages}}\nThe name ''Nubia'' is derived from that of the [[Noba]] people, nomads who settled the area in the 4th century CE following the collapse of the kingdom of [[Mero\u00eb]]. The Noba spoke a [[Nilo-Saharan]] language, ancestral to [[Old Nubian language|Old Nubian]]. Old Nubian was mostly used in religious texts dating from the 8th and 15th centuries. Before the 4th century, and throughout [[classical antiquity]], Nubia was known as ''[[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]]'', or, in [[Classical Greece|Classical Greek]] usage, included under the name ''[[Ancient Ethiopia|Ethiopia]]'' (''[[Aethiopia]]'').\n\nHistorically, the [[Nubian people|people of Nubia]] spoke at least two varieties of the [[Nubian language]] group, a subfamily that includes [[Nobiin]] (the descendant of Old Nubian), [[Kenuzi-Dongola]], [[Midob people|Midob]] and several related varieties in the northern part of the [[Nuba Mountains]] in South [[Kordofan]]. Until at least 1970, the [[Birgid language]] was spoken north of [[Nyala, Sudan|Nyala]] in [[Darfur]], but is now extinct. However, the linguistic identity of the ancient [[Kerma Culture]] of southern and central Nubia (also known as [[Upper Nubia]]), is uncertain, with some suggesting that it belonged to the [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] branch of [[Afroasiatic]] languages,<ref name=\"Bechaus-Gerst\">{{cite book |first1=Marianne |last1=Bechaus-Gerst |first2=Roger |last2=Blench |editor= Kevin MacDonald |title=The Origins and Development of African Livestock: Archaeology, Genetics, Linguistics and Ethnography \u2013 \"Linguistic evidence for the prehistory of livestock in Sudan\" (2000) |date=2014 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1135434166 |page=453 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=-t5QAwAAQBAJ |accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Lbant\">{{cite book |last1=Behrens |first1=Peter |title=Libya Antiqua: Report and Papers of the Symposium Organized by Unesco in Paris, 16 to 18 January 1984 \u2013 \"Language and migrations of the early Saharan cattle herders: the formation of the Berber branch\" |date=1986 |publisher=Unesco |isbn=9231023764 |page=30 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=p_hwAAAAMAAJ |accessdate=14 September 2014}}</ref> and other more recent research indicating that the Kerma culture instead belonged to the [[Eastern Sudanic]] branch of Nilo-Saharan languages, and that other peoples of northern (or [[Lower Nubia|Lower]]) Nubia north of Kerma (such as the C-group culture and the Blemmyes) spoke Cushitic languages before the spread of Eastern Sudanic languages from southern (or [[Upper Nubia|Upper]]) Nubia.<ref name=\"Rilly2010\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rilly C  | title = Recent Research on Meroitic, the Ancient Language of Sudan | date = 2010 |url = http://www.ityopis.org/Issues-1_files/ITYOPIS-I-Rilly.pdf}}</ref><ref name=\"Rilly200162\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rilly C | title = The Wadi Howar Diaspora and its role in the spread of East Sudanic languages from the fourth to the first millenia BCE | journal = Faits de Langues | volume = 47 | date = January 2016 |url = https://brill.com/view/journals/fdl/47/1/article-p151.xml | doi = 10.1163/19589514-047-01-900000010 }}</ref><ref name=\"Rilly2008\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rilly C | title = Enemy brothers.

Thus, Nubia became the first nome of Upper Egypt. At the time of the first dynasty, the A-Group area seems to have been entirely depopulated,<ref name=\"Emberling 2011 8\" /> most likely due to immigration to areas west and south.\n\nThis culture began to decline in the early 28th century BCE. [[George Andrew Reisner|George Reisner]] suggested that it was succeeded by a culture that he called the \"B-Group\", but most archaeologists today believe that this culture never existed and that the area was depopulated from c. 3000 BCE to c. 2500 BCE, when a-group descendants returned to the area.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Shaw|editor1-first=Ian|editor2-last=Jameson|editor2-first=Robert|title=A Dictionary of Archaeology|date=2002|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-631-23583-5|page=115}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=T\u00f6r\u00f6k|first1=L\u00e1szl\u00f3|title=Between Two Worlds:The Frontier Region between Ancient Nubia and Egypt 3700 BC \u2013 500AD|date=2008|publisher=Brill|isbn=9789004171978 |pages=53\u201354}}</ref> The causes of this are uncertain, but it was perhaps caused by Egyptian invasions and pillaging that began at this time. Nubia is believed to have served as a trade corridor between Egypt and tropical Africa long before 3100 BCE. Egyptian craftsmen of the period used [[ivory]] and [[ebony]] from tropical Africa, which came through Nubia.\n\nIn 2300 BCE, Nubia was first mentioned in [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] Egyptian accounts of trade missions. From [[Aswan]], right above the First Cataract, the southern limit of Egyptian control at the time, [[Egyptians]] imported gold, incense, ebony, copper, ivory, and exotic animals from tropical Africa through Nubia. As trade between Egypt and Nubia increased, so did wealth and stability. By the Egyptian 6th dynasty, Nubia was divided into a series of small kingdoms. There is debate over whether these [[Nubian C-Group|C-Group]] peoples,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/2394005/The_C-Group_people_in_Lower_Nubia_2500_-_1500_BC._Cattle_pastoralists_in_a_multicultural_setting|title=The C-Group people in Lower Nubia, 2500 \u2013 1500 BC.

There are definite similarities between the pottery of the A-Group and C-Group, so it may be a return of the ousted Group-As, or an internal revival of lost arts. At this time, the Sahara Desert was becoming too arid to support human beings, and it is possible that there was a sudden influx of Saharan nomads. C-Group pottery is characterized by all-over incised geometric lines with white infill and impressed imitations of basketry.\n\nDuring the Egyptian [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (c. 2040\u20131640 BCE), Egypt began expanding into Nubia to gain more control over the trade routes in Northern Nubia and direct access to trade with Southern Nubia. They erected a chain of forts down the Nile below the Second Cataract. These garrisons seemed to have peaceful relations with the local Nubian people, but little interaction during the period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/2393840/Between_Kush_and_Egypt_The_C-Group_people_of_Lower_Nubia_during_the_Middle_Kingdom_and_Second_Intermediate_Period|title=Between Kush and Egypt: The C-Group people of Lower Nubia during the Middle Kingdom and Second Intermediate Period|website=www.academia.edu|access-date=2016-06-08}}</ref> A contemporaneous but distinct culture from the C-Group was the Pan Grave culture, so-called because of their shallow graves. The Pan Graves are associated with the East bank of the Nile, but the Pan Graves and C-Group definitely interacted. Their pottery is characterized by incised lines of a more limited character than those of the C-Group, generally having interspersed undecorated spaces within the geometric schemes.\n\n===Nubia and ancient Egypt===\n{{Infobox hieroglyphs\n|name = <hiero>N17-Aa32-X1:N18</hiero><ref name=E118>Elmar Edel: ''Zu den Inschriften auf den Jahreszeitenreliefs der \"Weltkammer\" aus dem Sonnenheiligtum des Niuserre, Teil 2''.

Similarities in rock art of A-Group Nubia and Upper Egypt support this position. Ancient Egypt conquered Nubian territory in various eras, and incorporated parts of the area into its provinces. The Nubians in turn were to conquer Egypt under its [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|25th Dynasty]].<ref>Barbara Watterson, ''The Egyptians''.

They became part of the Egyptian military as scouts and minor workers.\n\nDuring the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]], \"Medjay\" no longer referred to the district of Medja but to a tribe or clan of people. It is not known what happened to the district, but, after the [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt]], it and other districts in Nubia were no longer mentioned in the written record.<ref>Gardiner, ''op.cit.'', p. 76*</ref> Written accounts detail the Medjay as nomadic desert people. Over time, they were incorporated into the Egyptian army. In the army, the Medjay served as garrison troops in Egyptian fortifications in Nubia and patrolled the deserts as a kind of gendarmerie.<ref>Bard, ''op.cit.'', p. 486</ref> This was done in the hope of preventing their fellow Medjay tribespeople from further attacking Egyptian assets in the region.<ref name=\"Wilkinson\">Wilkinson, ''op.cit.'', p. 147</ref> Later, they were even used during [[Kamose]]'s campaign against the [[Hyksos]]<ref>Shaw, ''op.cit.'', p. 201</ref> and became instrumental in making the Egyptian state into a military power.<ref>Steindorff & Seele, ''op.cit.'', p. 28</ref>\n\nBy the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt]] during the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom period]], the Medjay were an elite paramilitary police force.<ref name=\"Wilkinson\"/> No longer did the term refer to an ethnic group and, over time, the new meaning became synonymous with the policing occupation in general. Being an elite police force, the Medjay were often used to protect valuable areas, especially royal and religious complexes. Though they are most notable for their protection of the royal palaces and tombs in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] and the surrounding areas, the Medjay were known to have been used throughout Upper and Lower Egypt.\n\n[[File:Ramesses II holding a crook and a flail. 19th Dynasty, c. 1240 BC.

As expected, strong Nubian features and dark coloring are seen in their sculpture and relief work. This dynasty ranks as among the greatest, whose fame far outlived its actual tenure on the throne. Especially interesting, it was a member of this dynasty that decreed that no Nehsy (riverine Nubian of the principality of Kush), except such as came for trade or diplomatic reasons, should pass by the Egyptian fortress and cops at the southern end of the [[cataracts of the Nile|Second Nile Cataract]]. Why would this royal family of Nubian ancestry ban other Nubians from coming into Egyptian territory? Because the Egyptian rulers of Nubian ancestry had become Egyptians culturally; as pharaohs, they exhibited typical Egyptian attitudes and adopted typical Egyptian policies. (Yurco 1989) <ref>F. J.

The result has been described as a wholesale Nubian assimilation into Egyptian society.

In the Kushite Period, when Nubians ruled as Pharaohs in their own right, the material culture of Dynasty XXV (about 750\u2013655 B.C.E.) was decidedly Egyptian in character. Nubia's entire landscape up to the region of the Third Cataract was dotted with temples indistinguishable in style and decoration from contemporary temples erected in Egypt.

According to Strabo, following the Kushite advance, [[Gaius Petronius]] (a Prefect of Egypt at the time) prepared a large army and marched south. The Roman forces clashed with the Kushite armies near Thebes and forced them to retreat to Pselchis (Maharraqa) in Kushite lands. Petronius then sent deputies to the Kushites in an attempt to reach a peace agreement and make certain demands.\n\nAccording to Strabo, the Kushites \"desired three days for consideration\" in order to make a final decision. However, after the three days, Kush did not respond and Petronius advanced with his armies and took the Kushite city of Premnis (modern [[Karanog]]) south of Maharraqa. From there, he advanced all the way south to Napata, the second Capital in Kush after Meroe. Petronius attacked and sacked Napata, causing the son of the Kushite Queen to flee. Strabo describes the defeat of the Kushites at Napata, stating that \"He (Petronius) made prisoners of the inhabitants\".<ref>Nubian Queens in the Nile Valley and Afro-Asiatic Cultural History \u2013 Carolyn Fluehr-Lobban, Professor of Anthropology, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston U.S.A, August 20\u201326, 1998</ref>\n\nDuring this time, the different parts of the region divided into smaller groups with individual leaders, or generals, each commanding small armies of mercenaries. They fought for control of what is now Nubia and its surrounding territories, leaving the entire region weak and vulnerable to attack. Mero\u00eb would eventually meet defeat by the new rising [[Kingdom of Aksum]] to their south under [[Ezana of Axum|King Ezana]].\n\nThe classification of the [[Meroitic language]] is uncertain; it was long assumed to have been one of the [[Afroasiatic languages]] like the [[Egyptian language]], but is now considered to have likely been one of the [[Eastern Sudanic languages]].\n\nAt some point during the 4th century CE, the region was conquered by the [[Noba]], from which the name ''Nubia'' may derive; another possibility is that it comes from the Egyptian word for [[gold (hieroglyph)|gold]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11147a.htm|title=Nubia|work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]|publisher=New Advent|access-date=31 July 2019}}</ref> From then on, the Romans referred to the area as [[Nobatia]].\n\n===Christian Nubia===\n{{Main|Makuria|Nobadia|Alodia}}\n[[File:Cross, Faras.jpg|thumb|upright|A church mural depicting an elaborate cross, [[Faras]] (12th century)]]\n<!--[[File:A post-Meroitic era Nubian royal crown from Ballana Tomb 118 by John Campana.jpg|thumb|The crown of a local [[Nubian kings|Nubian king]] who ruled between the collapse of the [[Meroitic period|Meroitic dynasty]] in 350 or 400 CE and the founding of the Christian kingdom of Nubia in 600 CE. It was found in Tomb 118 at [[Ballana]] in Lower Nubia by the British Egyptologist [[Walter Bryan Emery|W.B. Emery]]]]-->\n\nAround 350 CE, the area was invaded by the [[Kingdom of Aksum]] and the Meroitic kingdom collapsed. Eventually, three smaller [[Christianity|Christian]] kingdoms replaced it: northernmost was [[Nobatia]] between the first and second cataract of the [[Nile River]], with its capital at Pachoras (modern-day [[Faras, Egypt]]); in the middle was [[Makuria]], with its capital at [[Old Dongola]]; and southernmost was [[Alodia]], with its capital at Soba (near [[Khartoum]]). King Silky of Nobatia crushed the [[Blemmyes]], and recorded his victory in a [[Greek language]] inscription carved in the wall of the temple of Talmis (modern [[Kalabsha]]) around 500 CE.\n\nWhile bishop [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] consecrated one Marcus as bishop of [[Philae]] before his death in 373, showing that [[Christianity]] had penetrated the region by the 4th century, [[John of Ephesus]] records that a [[Miaphysite]] priest named Julian converted the king and his nobles of Nobatia around 545. John of Ephesus also writes that the kingdom of Alodia was converted around 569. However, [[John of Biclarum]] records that the kingdom of Makuria was converted to [[Catholicism]] the same year, suggesting that John of Ephesus might be mistaken. Further doubt is cast on John's testimony by an entry in the chronicle of the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria]] [[Eutychius of Alexandria]], which states that in 719 the church of Nubia transferred its allegiance from the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek]] to the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox Church]].\n\nBy the 7th century, Makuria expanded becoming the dominant power in the region. It was strong enough to halt the southern expansion of [[Islam]] after the [[Arabs]] had taken Egypt. After several failed invasions the new Muslim rulers agreed to a treaty with Dongola, called [[Baqt]], allowing for peaceful coexistence and trade, contingent on the Nubians making an annual payment consisting of slaves and other tribute to the Islamic Governor at Aswan.<ref>https://www.penn.museum/sites/expedition/medieval-nubia/?et_rid=586265644&s_campaign=arguable:newsletter</ref>  This treaty held for six hundred years; it also guaranteed that any runaway slaves were returned to Nubia.<ref>https://www.penn.museum/sites/expedition/medieval-nubia/?et_rid=586265644&s_campaign=arguable:newsletter</ref>  Throughout this period, Nubia's main exports were dates and slaves,<ref>https://www.penn.museum/sites/expedition/medieval-nubia/?et_rid=586265644&s_campaign=arguable:newsletter</ref> though ivory and gold were also exchanged for Egyptian ceramics, textiles, and glass.<ref>https://oi.uchicago.edu/museum-exhibits/nubia/medieval-nubia?et_rid=586265644&s_campaign=arguable:newsletter</ref>  Over time the influx of Arab traders introduced Islam to Nubia and it gradually supplanted [[Christianity]]; furthermore, following an interruption in the annual tribute of slaves, the Egyptian Mamluk ruler invaded in 1272 and declared himself sovereign over half of Nubia.<ref>https://www.penn.museum/sites/expedition/medieval-nubia/?et_rid=586265644&s_campaign=arguable:newsletter</ref>  While there are records of a bishop at [[Qasr Ibrim]] in 1372, his see had come to include that located at Faras. It is also clear that the cathedral of Dongola had been converted to a mosque in 1317.<ref>Hassan, ''Arabs'', 125.</ref>\n\nThe influx of [[Arabs]] and Nubians to Egypt and Sudan had contributed to the suppression of the Nubian identity following the collapse of the last Nubian kingdom around 1504. A vast majority of the Nubian population is currently Muslim, and the Arabic language is their main medium of communication in addition to their indigenous Nubian language. The unique characteristic of Nubian is shown in their culture (dress, dances, traditions, and music).\n\n===Islamic Nubia===\n{{main|Islamization of Sudan}}\n[[File:Gallery of Nubians (early 19th centuy).jpg|thumb|Nubians from the early 19th century]]\nIn the 14th century, the Dongolan government collapsed and the region became divided and dominated by Arabs. The next centuries would see several Arab invasions of the region, as well as the establishment of a number of smaller kingdoms. Northern Nubia was brought under Egyptian control, while the south came under the control of the [[Kingdom of Sennar]] in the 16th century. The entire region would come under Egyptian control during the rule of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] in the early 19th century, and later became a joint Anglo-Egyptian [[condominium (international law)|condominium]]. {{further|Egyptian invasion of Sudan 1820\u201324#Invasion of Nubia}}\n\n==Contemporary issues==\n{{Further|Nubian people}}\nWith the end of colonialism and the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|establishment]] of the [[Republic of Egypt]] (1953), and the secession of the [[Republic of Sudan]] from [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|unity with Egypt]] (1956), Nubia was divided between Egypt and Sudan.\n\nDuring the early-1970s, many Egyptian and Sudanese Nubians were forcibly resettled to make room for [[Lake Nasser]] after the construction of the [[Aswan Dam|dams]] at [[Aswan]].<ref name=\"NubianFoundation\">{{Cite web|url=http://nubianfoundation.org/about-nubia/|title=About Nubia|date=2018|website=Nubian Foundation|access-date=31 July 2019}}</ref> Nubian villages can now be found north of Aswan on the west bank of the Nile and on [[Elephantine Island]]; and many Nubians now live in large cities, such as [[Cairo]].<ref name=\"NubianFoundation\" />\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Adam, William Y.

It was the seat of one of the earliest [[civilizations]] of [[ancient]] [[Africa]], as the [[Kerma culture]] lasted from around 2500 BCE until its conquest by the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]] under [[pharaoh]] [[Thutmose I]] around 1500 BCE. Nubia was home to several [[African empires|empires]], most prominently the [[kingdom of Kush]], which conquered Egypt during the 8th century BC during the reign of [[Piye]] and ruled the country as its [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-fifth Dynasty]] (to be replaced a century later by the native Egyptian [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-sixth Dynasty]]).\n\nThe collapse of Kush in the 4th century CE after more than a thousand years of existence was precipitated by an invasion by [[Ethiopia]]'s [[Kingdom of Aksum]] and saw the rise of three Christian kingdoms, [[Nobatia]], [[Makuria]] and [[Alodia]], the last two again lasting for roughly a millennium. Their eventual decline initiated not only the partition of Nubia into the northern half conquered by the [[Ottomans]] and the southern half by the [[Sennar (sultanate)|Sennar sultanate]] in the 16th century, but also a rapid [[Islamization]] and partial [[Arabization]] of the [[Nubian people]]. Nubia was again united with the [[Khedivate of Egypt]] in the 19th century. Today, the region of Nubia is split between Egypt and Sudan.\n\nThe primarily [[Archaeology|archaeological]] science dealing with ancient Nubia is called [[Nubiology]].\n\n==Linguistics==\n{{Main article|Nubian languages}}\nThe name ''Nubia'' is derived from that of the [[Noba]] people, nomads who settled the area in the 4th century CE following the collapse of the kingdom of [[Mero\u00eb]]. The Noba spoke a [[Nilo-Saharan]] language, ancestral to [[Old Nubian language|Old Nubian]]. Old Nubian was mostly used in religious texts dating from the 8th and 15th centuries. Before the 4th century, and throughout [[classical antiquity]], Nubia was known as ''[[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]]'', or, in [[Classical Greece|Classical Greek]] usage, included under the name ''[[Ancient Ethiopia|Ethiopia]]'' (''[[Aethiopia]]'').\n\nHistorically, the [[Nubian people|people of Nubia]] spoke at least two varieties of the [[Nubian language]] group, a subfamily that includes [[Nobiin]] (the descendant of Old Nubian), [[Kenuzi-Dongola]], [[Midob people|Midob]] and several related varieties in the northern part of the [[Nuba Mountains]] in South [[Kordofan]]. Until at least 1970, the [[Birgid language]] was spoken north of [[Nyala, Sudan|Nyala]] in [[Darfur]], but is now extinct. However, the linguistic identity of the ancient [[Kerma Culture]] of southern and central Nubia (also known as [[Upper Nubia]]), is uncertain, with some suggesting that it belonged to the [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] branch of [[Afroasiatic]] languages,<ref name=\"Bechaus-Gerst\">{{cite book |first1=Marianne |last1=Bechaus-Gerst |first2=Roger |last2=Blench |editor= Kevin MacDonald |title=The Origins and Development of African Livestock: Archaeology, Genetics, Linguistics and Ethnography \u2013 \"Linguistic evidence for the prehistory of livestock in Sudan\" (2000) |date=2014 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1135434166 |page=453 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=-t5QAwAAQBAJ |accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Lbant\">{{cite book |last1=Behrens |first1=Peter |title=Libya Antiqua: Report and Papers of the Symposium Organized by Unesco in Paris, 16 to 18 January 1984 \u2013 \"Language and migrations of the early Saharan cattle herders: the formation of the Berber branch\" |date=1986 |publisher=Unesco |isbn=9231023764 |page=30 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=p_hwAAAAMAAJ |accessdate=14 September 2014}}</ref> and other more recent research indicating that the Kerma culture instead belonged to the [[Eastern Sudanic]] branch of Nilo-Saharan languages, and that other peoples of northern (or [[Lower Nubia|Lower]]) Nubia north of Kerma (such as the C-group culture and the Blemmyes) spoke Cushitic languages before the spread of Eastern Sudanic languages from southern (or [[Upper Nubia|Upper]]) Nubia.<ref name=\"Rilly2010\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rilly C  | title = Recent Research on Meroitic, the Ancient Language of Sudan | date = 2010 |url = http://www.ityopis.org/Issues-1_files/ITYOPIS-I-Rilly.pdf}}</ref><ref name=\"Rilly200162\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rilly C | title = The Wadi Howar Diaspora and its role in the spread of East Sudanic languages from the fourth to the first millenia BCE | journal = Faits de Langues | volume = 47 | date = January 2016 |url = https://brill.com/view/journals/fdl/47/1/article-p151.xml | doi = 10.1163/19589514-047-01-900000010 }}</ref><ref name=\"Rilly2008\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rilly C | title = Enemy brothers.

Thus, Nubia became the first nome of Upper Egypt. At the time of the first dynasty, the A-Group area seems to have been entirely depopulated,<ref name=\"Emberling 2011 8\" /> most likely due to immigration to areas west and south.\n\nThis culture began to decline in the early 28th century BCE. [[George Andrew Reisner|George Reisner]] suggested that it was succeeded by a culture that he called the \"B-Group\", but most archaeologists today believe that this culture never existed and that the area was depopulated from c. 3000 BCE to c. 2500 BCE, when a-group descendants returned to the area.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Shaw|editor1-first=Ian|editor2-last=Jameson|editor2-first=Robert|title=A Dictionary of Archaeology|date=2002|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-631-23583-5|page=115}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=T\u00f6r\u00f6k|first1=L\u00e1szl\u00f3|title=Between Two Worlds:The Frontier Region between Ancient Nubia and Egypt 3700 BC \u2013 500AD|date=2008|publisher=Brill|isbn=9789004171978 |pages=53\u201354}}</ref> The causes of this are uncertain, but it was perhaps caused by Egyptian invasions and pillaging that began at this time. Nubia is believed to have served as a trade corridor between Egypt and tropical Africa long before 3100 BCE. Egyptian craftsmen of the period used [[ivory]] and [[ebony]] from tropical Africa, which came through Nubia.\n\nIn 2300 BCE, Nubia was first mentioned in [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] Egyptian accounts of trade missions. From [[Aswan]], right above the First Cataract, the southern limit of Egyptian control at the time, [[Egyptians]] imported gold, incense, ebony, copper, ivory, and exotic animals from tropical Africa through Nubia. As trade between Egypt and Nubia increased, so did wealth and stability. By the Egyptian 6th dynasty, Nubia was divided into a series of small kingdoms. There is debate over whether these [[Nubian C-Group|C-Group]] peoples,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/2394005/The_C-Group_people_in_Lower_Nubia_2500_-_1500_BC._Cattle_pastoralists_in_a_multicultural_setting|title=The C-Group people in Lower Nubia, 2500 \u2013 1500 BC. Cattle pastoralists in a multicultural setting|website=www.academia.edu|access-date=2016-06-08}}</ref> who flourished from c. 2500 BCE to c. 1500 BCE, were another internal evolution or invaders. There are definite similarities between the pottery of the A-Group and C-Group, so it may be a return of the ousted Group-As, or an internal revival of lost arts. At this time, the Sahara Desert was becoming too arid to support human beings, and it is possible that there was a sudden influx of Saharan nomads. C-Group pottery is characterized by all-over incised geometric lines with white infill and impressed imitations of basketry.\n\nDuring the Egyptian [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (c. 2040\u20131640 BCE), Egypt began expanding into Nubia to gain more control over the trade routes in Northern Nubia and direct access to trade with Southern Nubia. They erected a chain of forts down the Nile below the Second Cataract. These garrisons seemed to have peaceful relations with the local Nubian people, but little interaction during the period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/2393840/Between_Kush_and_Egypt_The_C-Group_people_of_Lower_Nubia_during_the_Middle_Kingdom_and_Second_Intermediate_Period|title=Between Kush and Egypt: The C-Group people of Lower Nubia during the Middle Kingdom and Second Intermediate Period|website=www.academia.edu|access-date=2016-06-08}}</ref> A contemporaneous but distinct culture from the C-Group was the Pan Grave culture, so-called because of their shallow graves. The Pan Graves are associated with the East bank of the Nile, but the Pan Graves and C-Group definitely interacted. Their pottery is characterized by incised lines of a more limited character than those of the C-Group, generally having interspersed undecorated spaces within the geometric schemes.\n\n===Nubia and ancient Egypt===\n{{Infobox hieroglyphs\n|name = <hiero>N17-Aa32-X1:N18</hiero><ref name=E118>Elmar Edel: ''Zu den Inschriften auf den Jahreszeitenreliefs der \"Weltkammer\" aus dem Sonnenheiligtum des Niuserre, Teil 2''.

Similarities in rock art of A-Group Nubia and Upper Egypt support this position. Ancient Egypt conquered Nubian territory in various eras, and incorporated parts of the area into its provinces. The Nubians in turn were to conquer Egypt under its [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|25th Dynasty]].<ref>Barbara Watterson, ''The Egyptians''.

They became part of the Egyptian military as scouts and minor workers.\n\nDuring the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]], \"Medjay\" no longer referred to the district of Medja but to a tribe or clan of people. It is not known what happened to the district, but, after the [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt]], it and other districts in Nubia were no longer mentioned in the written record.<ref>Gardiner, ''op.cit.'', p. 76*</ref> Written accounts detail the Medjay as nomadic desert people.

In the army, the Medjay served as garrison troops in Egyptian fortifications in Nubia and patrolled the deserts as a kind of gendarmerie.<ref>Bard, ''op.cit.'', p. 486</ref> This was done in the hope of preventing their fellow Medjay tribespeople from further attacking Egyptian assets in the region.<ref name=\"Wilkinson\">Wilkinson, ''op.cit.'', p. 147</ref> Later, they were even used during [[Kamose]]'s campaign against the [[Hyksos]]<ref>Shaw, ''op.cit.'', p. 201</ref> and became instrumental in making the Egyptian state into a military power.<ref>Steindorff & Seele, ''op.cit.'', p. 28</ref>\n\nBy the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt]] during the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom period]], the Medjay were an elite paramilitary police force.<ref name=\"Wilkinson\"/> No longer did the term refer to an ethnic group and, over time, the new meaning became synonymous with the policing occupation in general. Being an elite police force, the Medjay were often used to protect valuable areas, especially royal and religious complexes. Though they are most notable for their protection of the royal palaces and tombs in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] and the surrounding areas, the Medjay were known to have been used throughout Upper and Lower Egypt.\n\n[[File:Ramesses II holding a crook and a flail. 19th Dynasty, c. 1240 BC.

These rulers handled matters in typical Egyptian fashion, reflecting the close cultural influences between the two regions.\n\n{{quote|[T]he XIIth Dynasty (1991\u20131786 B.C.E.) originated from the [[Aswan]] region. As expected, strong Nubian features and dark coloring are seen in their sculpture and relief work. This dynasty ranks as among the greatest, whose fame far outlived its actual tenure on the throne. Especially interesting, it was a member of this dynasty that decreed that no Nehsy (riverine Nubian of the principality of Kush), except such as came for trade or diplomatic reasons, should pass by the Egyptian fortress and cops at the southern end of the [[cataracts of the Nile|Second Nile Cataract]]. Why would this royal family of Nubian ancestry ban other Nubians from coming into Egyptian territory? Because the Egyptian rulers of Nubian ancestry had become Egyptians culturally; as pharaohs, they exhibited typical Egyptian attitudes and adopted typical Egyptian policies. (Yurco 1989) <ref>F. J.

The result has been described as a wholesale Nubian assimilation into Egyptian society. This assimilation was so complete that it masked all Nubian ethnic identities insofar as archaeological remains are concerned beneath the impenetrable veneer of Egypt's material culture. In the Kushite Period, when Nubians ruled as Pharaohs in their own right, the material culture of Dynasty XXV (about 750\u2013655 B.C.E.) was decidedly Egyptian in character. Nubia's entire landscape up to the region of the Third Cataract was dotted with temples indistinguishable in style and decoration from contemporary temples erected in Egypt.

From there, he advanced all the way south to Napata, the second Capital in Kush after Meroe. Petronius attacked and sacked Napata, causing the son of the Kushite Queen to flee.

King Silky of Nobatia crushed the [[Blemmyes]], and recorded his victory in a [[Greek language]] inscription carved in the wall of the temple of Talmis (modern [[Kalabsha]]) around 500 CE.\n\nWhile bishop [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] consecrated one Marcus as bishop of [[Philae]] before his death in 373, showing that [[Christianity]] had penetrated the region by the 4th century, [[John of Ephesus]] records that a [[Miaphysite]] priest named Julian converted the king and his nobles of Nobatia around 545. John of Ephesus also writes that the kingdom of Alodia was converted around 569. However, [[John of Biclarum]] records that the kingdom of Makuria was converted to [[Catholicism]] the same year, suggesting that John of Ephesus might be mistaken. Further doubt is cast on John's testimony by an entry in the chronicle of the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria]] [[Eutychius of Alexandria]], which states that in 719 the church of Nubia transferred its allegiance from the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek]] to the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox Church]].\n\nBy the 7th century, Makuria expanded becoming the dominant power in the region. It was strong enough to halt the southern expansion of [[Islam]] after the [[Arabs]] had taken Egypt. After several failed invasions the new Muslim rulers agreed to a treaty with Dongola, called [[Baqt]], allowing for peaceful coexistence and trade, contingent on the Nubians making an annual payment consisting of slaves and other tribute to the Islamic Governor at Aswan.<ref>https://www.penn.museum/sites/expedition/medieval-nubia/?et_rid=586265644&s_campaign=arguable:newsletter</ref>  This treaty held for six hundred years; it also guaranteed that any runaway slaves were returned to Nubia.<ref>https://www.penn.museum/sites/expedition/medieval-nubia/?et_rid=586265644&s_campaign=arguable:newsletter</ref>  Throughout this period, Nubia's main exports were dates and slaves,<ref>https://www.penn.museum/sites/expedition/medieval-nubia/?et_rid=586265644&s_campaign=arguable:newsletter</ref> though ivory and gold were also exchanged for Egyptian ceramics, textiles, and glass.<ref>https://oi.uchicago.edu/museum-exhibits/nubia/medieval-nubia?et_rid=586265644&s_campaign=arguable:newsletter</ref>  Over time the influx of Arab traders introduced Islam to Nubia and it gradually supplanted [[Christianity]]; furthermore, following an interruption in the annual tribute of slaves, the Egyptian Mamluk ruler invaded in 1272 and declared himself sovereign over half of Nubia.<ref>https://www.penn.museum/sites/expedition/medieval-nubia/?et_rid=586265644&s_campaign=arguable:newsletter</ref>  While there are records of a bishop at [[Qasr Ibrim]] in 1372, his see had come to include that located at Faras. It is also clear that the cathedral of Dongola had been converted to a mosque in 1317.<ref>Hassan, ''Arabs'', 125.</ref>\n\nThe influx of [[Arabs]] and Nubians to Egypt and Sudan had contributed to the suppression of the Nubian identity following the collapse of the last Nubian kingdom around 1504. A vast majority of the Nubian population is currently Muslim, and the Arabic language is their main medium of communication in addition to their indigenous Nubian language. The unique characteristic of Nubian is shown in their culture (dress, dances, traditions, and music).\n\n===Islamic Nubia===\n{{main|Islamization of Sudan}}\n[[File:Gallery of Nubians (early 19th centuy).jpg|thumb|Nubians from the early 19th century]]\nIn the 14th century, the Dongolan government collapsed and the region became divided and dominated by Arabs. The next centuries would see several Arab invasions of the region, as well as the establishment of a number of smaller kingdoms. Northern Nubia was brought under Egyptian control, while the south came under the control of the [[Kingdom of Sennar]] in the 16th century. The entire region would come under Egyptian control during the rule of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] in the early 19th century, and later became a joint Anglo-Egyptian [[condominium (international law)|condominium]]. {{further|Egyptian invasion of Sudan 1820\u201324#Invasion of Nubia}}\n\n==Contemporary issues==\n{{Further|Nubian people}}\nWith the end of colonialism and the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|establishment]] of the [[Republic of Egypt]] (1953), and the secession of the [[Republic of Sudan]] from [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|unity with Egypt]] (1956), Nubia was divided between Egypt and Sudan.\n\nDuring the early-1970s, many Egyptian and Sudanese Nubians were forcibly resettled to make room for [[Lake Nasser]] after the construction of the [[Aswan Dam|dams]] at [[Aswan]].<ref name=\"NubianFoundation\">{{Cite web|url=http://nubianfoundation.org/about-nubia/|title=About Nubia|date=2018|website=Nubian Foundation|access-date=31 July 2019}}</ref> Nubian villages can now be found north of Aswan on the west bank of the Nile and on [[Elephantine Island]]; and many Nubians now live in large cities, such as [[Cairo]].<ref name=\"NubianFoundation\" />\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Adam, William Y.
