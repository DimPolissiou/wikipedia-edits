However many fraternities operate large off-campus houses in or near the North Clemson Neighborhood adjacent to campus. These houses roughly fall between 3000sqft-6500sqft and typically house 6-10 persons in full apartment style housing. The restriction on fraternity housing is due to a Clemson city ordinance which prohibits more than 3 unrelated persons from living in the same house/apartment within Clemson city limits (most of the fraternity houses were grandfathered into this rule). Most social functions hosted by fraternities happen at these large off campus houses and most of these functions are multi-fraternity sponsored (fraternities at Clemson tend to socialize with each other more than at other equivalent Universities). Sororities host numerous mixers/functions at bars and various locales in the Clemson downtown area. Popular off-campus activities that Greek life regularly and widely attend include Mountain Weekends (fall trips to mountain cabins hosted separately as a date function by each fraternity), Formals (fraternities usually host formal at a beach front location or large city while sororities tend to rent out ballrooms in the local upstate South Carolina area) and Carolina Cup (semi-annual horse race in spring in Camden, SC).\n\n==History==\nClemson had a strong military heritage but in 1955 the first women undergraduates arrived campus. By 1955, civilians had arrived on campus and soon fraternities and sororities were an idea in demand.<ref name=\"Clemson University Fraternity and Sorority Life\"/>\nIn 1959 the Board of Trustees approved the development of the first sororities and fraternities.  The idea was recommended to them by Walter Cox and the President at the time, Robert C. Edwards.\nEight men's fraternities and two sororities were founded between 1956-1966. The fraternities/sororities operated under local names until 1970 when Clemson allowed national Greek organizations on campus. In 1956 the Numeral Society (Sigma Alpha Epsilon) was the first fraternity established on campus. From 1958 to 1966, seven more fraternities were recognized by the university, in order of founding: (national affiliation shown in parentheses):  Phi Kappa Delta (Kappa Alpha Order),  'Deacons' Delta Kappa Alpha (Alpha Tau Omega), Kappa Delta Chi (Sigma Nu), 'Zetas'  Sigma Alpha Zeta (Pi Kappa Alpha), 'Snappers' Kappa Sigma Nu (Kappa Sigma), Delta Phi (Phi Delta Theta), and Sigma Kappa Epsilon (Beta Theta Pi). Followed by Alpha Gamma (Sigma Phi Epsilon & Alpha Gamma Rho) and Phi Gamma Delta (FIJI) in 1971 and Chi Lam (Theta Chi) in 1974. Chi Chi Chi, was the first sorority later changing their name to Delta Theta Chi (Tri Delt).  The second sorority was Omicron Zeta Tau (Kappa Kappa Gamma) followed soon after by Sigma Beta Chi. By 1969 three local sororities and 9 local fraternities could be found on campus.  The organizations urged the right to be affiliate with the national organizations and sought help from Dean Delony. On February 1, 1970, Zetas (Pi Kappa Alpha) became first nationally recognized fraternity on Clemson's campus followed soon after by Phi Kappa Delta (Kappa Alpha Order).  Sigma Beta Chi choose to affiliate with Chi Omega, Delta Theta Chi with Delta Delta Delta and Omicron Zeta Tau with Kappa Kappa Gamma.  These sororities would become the first three national sororities on campus.  Delony choose to house the affiliated women in their own dorms instead of building sorority and fraternity houses.  The sororities continued to grow in number, the fourth sorority being [[Kappa Alpha Theta]] followed by [[Alpha Delta Pi]], [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]] and [[Pi Beta Phi]].<ref name=\"Women and Clemson University\"/>\n\n==Government==\n\n===College Panhellenic Council===\nThe Panhellenic Council is the governing body for all [[National Panhellenic Conference]] (NPC) organizations on campus.
