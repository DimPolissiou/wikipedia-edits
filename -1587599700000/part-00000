At age eighteen, he began to drive in support events for the car races of the time. He was a mechanic, but sought to be a race car driver and signed on with the [[Duesenberg]] brothers after [[World War I]]. Hartz made his debut at the 1921 [[Indianapolis 500]] race as [[Eddie Hearne]]'s riding mechanic.\n\nThe following year, Hartz was behind the wheel of the Duesenberg and finished in second place. In 1923, he finished in second place again in a Cliff Durant Special, and placed in fourth position next year. In 1925, he brought his own {{convert|121|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} Miller and finished fourth, and returned the next year with his {{convert|90|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} Miller Special to capture second place. His car had a mechanical failure in 1927. He is the only driver to come in second in the Indianapolis 500 three times, but never to win the race in his six attempts.\n\nHartz was successful in [[board track racing]]. He finished in the top five positions 46 times out of the 69 major events he started, and won seven championship events.\n\nHartz was badly burned and injured in a crash in 1927 at the Rockingham Speedway in [[Salem, New Hampshire]], requiring him to spend the next two years in hospitals. The [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|stock market crash]] of 1929 also inflicted heavy financial losses for him. He retired from racing to become a team owner and chief mechanic. Hartz bought a used 1927 Miller 91 front-drive race car, and built the car for the junk-formula by widening the chassis and installing a bored-out Miller 122 (151 cu in).<ref name=miller03>{{cite web|url= http://www.milleroffy.com/Miller%20Club%202003.htm |title=The Harry A.
