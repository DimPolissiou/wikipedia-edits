Via earlier incarnations, the Dark Blue Bicycle Club (D.B.B.C.) and the Oxford University Bicycle Club (O.U.Bi.C.), it has a history reaching back to the very origins of club and competitive cycling.\n\nCycling is a [[Oxford blue|discretionary full blue]] sport at Oxford with half blues awarded to the three riders comprising the fastest Oxford team in the [[Varsity Match]] against [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], as well as three full blues awarded at the captain's discretion.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Early years===\nThe history of club cycling at the University of Oxford, is extremely long and distinguished, but not continuous. The club has existed under three different names, and there have been periods during which no functioning club has been at all apparent. The Dark Blue Bicycle Club (taking its name from the identifying sporting colour of the University, known otherwise as [[Oxford Blue (colour)|Oxford Blue]]) was founded in 1873. Its stated objects were \"the holding of meets and races, the arrangement of tours, and generally to facilitate and encourage bicycling in the University\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=Rules of the Dark Blue Bicycle Club|publisher=The Dark Blue Bicycle Club|year=1877|isbn=|location=Bodleian Library, Oxford, G.A.

In the following year it acquired a handful of keen racing members, among them the ebullient Malcolm Prince (Jesus Coll.) who, with Brian Stackhouse (University Coll.) cycled to London to represent the club at the inaugural meeting of the British Universities' Cycling Union (BUCU). In 1953, the club organized the BUCU 25-mile T.T. championship and later in the same year it competed against the Cambridge University Cycle Racing Club (now CUCC) in a \"3-up\"  team time trial on a \"neutral\" course near [[Whipsnade]]. Cambridge \"rode over\" to win, after the Oxford team suffered mechanical failure.  The club at this time had a single female member, Margaret Wilkinson (Lady Margaret Hall) , while J. B.

In 1958, following a challenge from Cambridge, who had heard of the OUCC.'s revival, the first Varsity Match of the current series was held; the contest being for a Varsity Shield, to be retained by the winning club until the next encounter.\n\nIn its modern form, the annual Varsity Match has normally taken the form of a 25-mile individual time trial held on open roads under [[Cycling Time Trials]] (formerly RTTC) rules. An exception was the 1976 contest, which was decided over 10 miles. There is no limit on the number of University entrants, nor is parity of numbers required. The teams are decided by the results, as the three fastest times set by riders of each club are added together, and the winner is deemed to be the club with the lower of the two aggregate times. A Women's Varsity Match was introduced as soon as there were enough racing members in each club to form teams. OUCC. hosts the event on its local roads in even years, and CUCC in odd years. \n\nIn the 1960's and 1970's, a much-diminished membership reflected the national decline in cycle sport and cycling in general. Fortunately for the survival of OUCC, a steady trickle of committed \u2018club\u2019 cyclists, who already belonged to their local clubs and had raced as juniors, passed through the University club. As well as maintaining, through several lean years, all the essential events in the club calendar, including the inter-college \u2018Cuppers\u2019 10-miles time trial, the club promoted the 1962 UAU. 50-mile championship time trial, in which it won its first individual and team medals at British Universities level; only [[Roy Cromack]], then riding for Sheffield University, denying Bill Fowler (Keble Coll.) the gold. The outstanding racing member of the mid-to-late \u201860s was Mark Carritt (Univ. Coll.), a typical OUCC. \u2018all-rounder\u2019, though very untypical in that he excelled at every form of cycling competition. Carritt took the Bucks-Oxon-Berks road race title twice, as well as the British Universities road race, while in time trials he was among the best British 12-hour riders of his day, and, at the 25-mile distance,\u00a0was the first OUCC rider to break the hour, recording a time of 58 minutes and 4 seconds in the 1968 Varsity Match. \n\nIn the early-to-mid 1970's, the club developed an interest in very long-distance rides, which included far-ranging vacation tours. It was through their membership of OUCC that the highly successful tandem tricycle pairing of Stuart Jackson and Edwin Hargraves came together, which took multiple United Kingdom place-to-place records. By the end of the 1970's, the  racing membership of the club had dwindled to six including the Senior Member, Rolls Royce Junior Research Fellow Lawrence Daniels (Keble Coll.). Defiantly, it entered teams in \u201c3-up\u201d and \u201c4-up\u201d time-trial \u201cOpen\u201d events. This was the nadir of the modern-era club, but the demises of 1902 and 1939 were not to be repeated. The club began to grow, and in 1981, for the first time in its history, OUCC gained sponsorship. This came from Competition Cycles of Cricklewood, London,\u00a0whose proprietor, Colin Freud (Christ Church Coll.), was a former member. Evidence of resurgence came in the windswept Varsity Match of 1982 in which six Oxford riders (also six Cambridge riders), riding the un-aerodynamic, steel bicycles of the era, all broke the hour for the 25-mile distance.<ref>\"Varsity Verve\", ''Oxford Mail,'' 12 May 1982.</ref>\n\nIn the last decades of the century, a growing club membership and an improving gender ratio made possible a fuller club programme. The racing section embraced science-informed training methods, introduced in the early 1980's by research neurologist and club coach, Dr Eugene \"Gene\" Merrill. Performance testing and computer analysis was subsequently brought in by [[Dick Poole (cyclist)|Dick Poole]], the club's performance adviser of the mid-1980's. A fortuitous kerbside meeting in 2007 led to the club benefiting from the coaching services of former [[Giro d'Italia]] rider Flavio Zappi. The drive for competition success at Oxford, however, has never been at the expense of\u00a0cycling for sheer enjoyment.\u00a0While its Cambridge rival has always succeeded in focusing on the Varsity Match, OUCC (like the D.B.B.C. and O.U.Bi.C. before it) has a more wayward history. Writers have observed that the spirit of the [[Scholar Gypsy]] affects cycling at Oxford generally, attributing this partly to the nature of Oxfordshire's country lanes and the county's characteristic topography and scenery.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morris|first=Jan|title=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-19-280136-8|location=Oxford|pages=107}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Griffin|first=Penny|title=St Hugh\u2019s: One Hundred Years of Women\u2019s Education in Oxford|publisher=Macmillan|year=1986|isbn=978-1-349-07727-4|location=Basingstoke and London|pages=118}}</ref> The local woods now provide trails for one of the club's relatively recent accretions, the mountain biking section.

Via earlier incarnations, the Dark Blue Bicycle Club (D.B.B.C.) and the Oxford University Bicycle Club (O.U.Bi.C.), it has a history reaching back to the very origins of club and competitive cycling.\n\nCycling is a [[Oxford blue|discretionary full blue]] sport at Oxford with half blues awarded to the three riders comprising the fastest Oxford team in the [[Varsity Match]] against [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], as well as three full blues awarded at the captain's discretion.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Early years===\nThe history of club cycling at the University of Oxford, is extremely long and distinguished, but not continuous. The club has existed under three different names, and there have been periods during which no functioning club has been at all apparent. The Dark Blue Bicycle Club (taking its name from the identifying sporting colour of the University, known otherwise as [[Oxford Blue (colour)|Oxford Blue]]) was founded in 1873. Its stated objects were \"the holding of meets and races, the arrangement of tours, and generally to facilitate and encourage bicycling in the University\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=Rules of the Dark Blue Bicycle Club|publisher=The Dark Blue Bicycle Club|year=1877|isbn=|location=Bodleian Library, Oxford, G.A.

Writers have observed that the spirit of the [[Scholar Gypsy]] affects cycling at Oxford generally, attributing this partly to the nature of Oxfordshire's country lanes and the county's characteristic topography and scenery.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morris|first=Jan|title=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-19-280136-8|location=Oxford|pages=107}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Griffin|first=Penny|title=St Hugh\u2019s: One Hundred Years of Women\u2019s Education in Oxford|publisher=Macmillan|year=1986|isbn=978-1-349-07727-4|location=Basingstoke and London|pages=118}}</ref> The local woods now provide trails for one of the club's relatively recent accretions, the mountain biking section. Mountain biking, by virtue of ts popularity, has earned its own Varsity Match, held annually as a cross-country (XC) race, in which, like the traditional road time-trial event, the winning team is deemed to be that which finishes with the lowest aggregate time. \n\n==Inter-university achievements==\nIn 1983, the club returned to British Universities competition. In that year, it hosted the BUSF/BSSF. 50-mile championship and, a few weeks later, won the team category for the BUSF/BSSF<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/search/archives/c8d24e5e-5284-34be-9efc-693894b5b8b4|title=British Universities' Sports Association Records Administrative/Biographical History|last=|first=|date=|website=Jisc Archives Hub|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=16 February 2020}}</ref> 100-mile championship in South Lancashire.

It is used for [[origami]], [[calligraphy]], paper screens and clothing. It is stronger than commercially made wood-pulp paper. Less commonly, the paper is made from [[rice straw]].\n\nDepending on the type of mulberry used, it is named kozo (''Broussonetia papyrifera'', the [[paper mulberry]]), gampi (''Wikstroemia diplomorpha''), or mitsumata (''Edgeworthia chrysantha''). The fiber comes from the bark of the paper mulberry, not the inner wood or pith, and traditionally the paper is made by hand.\n\nThe branches of the paper mulberry shrubs are harvested in the autumn, so the fibre can be processed and the paper formed during the cold winter months, because the fibre spoils easily in the heat. The branches are cut into sections two to three feet long and steamed in a large kettle, which makes the bark shrink back from the inner wood, allowing it to be pulled off like a banana peel. The bark can then be dried and stored, or used immediately. There are three layers to the bark at this stage: black bark, the outermost layer; green bark, the middle layer; and white bark, the innermost layer. All three can be made into paper, but the finest paper is made of white bark only.\n\nIf the bark strips have been dried, they are soaked in water overnight before being processed further. To clean the black and green bark from the white bark, the bark strip is spread on a board and scraped with a flat knife. Any knots or tough spots in the fibre are cut out and discarded at this stage.\n\nThe scraped bark strips are then cooked for two or three hours in a mixture of water and [[soda ash]]. The fibre is cooked enough when it can easily be pulled apart lengthwise. The strips are then rinsed several times in clean water to rinse off the soda ash. Rinsing also makes the fibre brighter and whiter\u2014fine kozo paper is not [[bleaching of wood pulp|bleach]]ed, but is naturally pure white.\n\nEach bark strip is then inspected by hand, against a white background or lit from behind by a light box. Any tiny pieces of black bark and other debris are removed with tweezers, and any knots or tough patches of fibre missed during scraping are cut out of the strips. The ultimate goal is to have completely pure white bark.\n\nThe scraped, cooked, and cleaned strips are then laid out on a table and beaten by hand. The beating tool is a wooden bat that looks like a thicker version of a [[cricket bat]]. The fibres are beaten for about half an hour, or until all the fibres have been separated and no longer resemble strips of bark.\n\nThe prepared fibre can now be made into sheets of paper. A viscous substance called formation aid is added to the vat with the fibre and water. Formation aid is polyethylene oxide, and it helps slow the flow of water, which gives the paper-maker more time to form sheets.
