Thousands of opposition activists were [[Internment|imprisoned]] without charge and as many as 91 killed.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6175517.stm Poland marks communist crackdown], [[BBC News]], 13 December 2006</ref> Although martial law was lifted in 1983, many of the [[political prisoner]]s were not released until a general [[amnesty]] in 1986.\n\nSince the 1970s, communist Poland was in a deep [[economic recession]]. The First Secretary [[Edward Gierek]] made large incessant loans from western creditors to achieve a better economic output that instead resulted in a domestic crisis. Basic goods were being heavily [[Rationing|rationed]] which acted as a stimuli for the establishment of a first anti-communist [[trade union]] in the [[Eastern Bloc]], known as Solidarity, in 1980. Gierek, who permitted the trade union to appear per the [[Gda\u0144sk Agreement]], was dismissed from his post less than a month later under pressure from the USSR and confined to [[house arrest]]. Poland's already somewhat liberal policies concerning the opposition were worrisome for hardliners in the [[Soviet Union]], who feared that the Poles may overthrow communism and ally themselves with the [[Western Bloc]]. The Soviets were particularly uneasy as the departure of Eastern Bloc's most populous nation from [[Comecon]] would trigger further financial and economic problems that would bring an end to communist rule in Central-Eastern Europe. After a series of strikes and demonstrations by employees of chief industrial regions, Poland was directly heading towards bankruptcy. \n\nThe [[Military Council of National Salvation]] was formed by the new First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], who was determined to put an end to the demonstrations and crush the opposition by force if necessary. There is speculation whether Jaruzelski instigated martial law to prevent bloodshed if the Soviets and other [[Warsaw Pact]] countries were to enter Poland under the mutual assistance treaty, like in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and the [[invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968]]. On 13 December 1981, Jaruzelski announced the introduction of martial law in a televised speech addressed to the entire nation. The Polish People's Army, [[Citizen's Militia]] (MO), [[ZOMO]] special units and tanks rolled onto the streets to scare off demonstrators, begin regular patrols and maintain [[curfew]]. Intercity travelling was forbidden unless a permit was granted by the authorities, food shortages intensified and censorship was placed on all media and [[post]]. The [[S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa|secret services (SB)]] [[wiretapped]] phones in public booths and state institutions. \n\nOn 16 December, pro-Solidarity miners organized a strike against the declaration of the martial law at the [[Wujek Coal Mine]] in the industrial city of [[Katowice]]. The ZOMO squads, nicknamed \"Communist [[Gestapo]]\" by the opposition, brutally [[Pacification of Wujek|pacified Wujek]], which resulted in the deaths of 9 miners. All other [[1982 demonstrations in Poland|demonstrations across Poland]] were met with armed force of the services, which utilized [[water cannons]], [[tear gas]], [[Baton (law enforcement)|batons]], truncheons and clubs to disperse crowds and beat protesters. Thousands were detained and some were tortured in state prisons. On 31 August 1982, in the copper-mining town of [[Lubin]], 3 people were mortally wounded by ZOMO. Until the end of the martial law on 22 July 1983, approximately 91 people were killed, though this figure varies and is still debated among historians.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6175517.stm Poland marks communist crackdown], [[BBC News]], 13 December 2006</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\n{{main|History of Poland (1945\u20131989)}}\n===Reforms of Edward Gierek (1970-1975)===\n[[File:Photograph of President Gerald R. Ford, First Secretary Edward Gierek of Poland, and Mrs. Stanislawa Gierek Waving from the Blue Room Balcony during a State Arrival Ceremony - NARA - 7462054.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Gierek in the [[White House]] with President [[Gerald Ford]], 1974]]\nWhen [[Edward Gierek]] succeeded [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka|Gomu\u0142ka]] as the head of state in 1970, he took decisive measures to boost economic growth and develop modern infrastructure. Gierek, a more [[Liberalism|liberal]] figure than his predecessor, was determined to make [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] the wealthiest and most economically significant communist country of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. However, these ideas prompted resistance from hardline communist leadership as the reform would effectively abandon the fundamental principles of a [[Planned economy|centrally planned]] [[Marxism|Marxist]] economy. The grip and emphasis on state-owned enterprises and state-controlled prices or trade was eventually loosened. Small private businesses began to appear and Poland recorded temporary growth in [[GDP]] and an improvement in living conditions. \n\nGierek maintained close ties with the [[United States]], which he subsequently used for diplomatic and economic purposes. In order to continue with the reforms, large sums of money were borrowed from [[creditors]] in the [[Western Bloc]]. These sequential and uninterrupted loans were primarily targeted at establishing heavy industry, mines or manufacturing facilities that would produce goods for [[export]]. The projected income from the exports would then be used to pay off the [[debt]]. Apart from financing the economic sector, the money was spent on [[social housing]] and on expanding road connections, for example the first fully operational [[highway]] linking Warsaw with industrial [[Silesia]] was opened for traffic in 1976. Furthermore, over 1.8 million [[plattenbau]] flats were constructed to house the growing population. Agricultural output rose by 22% between 1971 and 1975. Gierek also initiated the construction of [[Warszawa Centralna]], Europe's most modern railway station at the time.\n\n===Crisis; debt, rationing and shortages (1976-1981)===\n[[File:Kartka cukier 1kg 07-76.jpg|thumb|left|140px|A ration card for sugar, 1976]]\nAs expenditures increased and debts accumulated, the West would no longer grant Poland loans. Moreover, the [[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 oil crisis|1979 oil crises]] affected the fragile economy. Due to previous GDP growth, higher income and expanded industries, the demand for certain goods and [[consumption]] surged. New factories and state enterprises required fuel, materials and a workforce to operate production lines. Soon, the country started exporting locally-produced stock designated for the Polish populace, thus resulting in widespread [[shortages]]. Because the remaining assets were directed at production, exports and debt repayment, the state also reduced imports to minimize expenses. \n\nIn 1976, the communist government introduced [[ration cards]] for sugar, meat, processed food and dairy. Confectionery, [[cocoa]], coffee, rice, [[tobacco]] and other goods not produced in Poland were so heavily rationed that they were almost permanently unavailable. The living standards began to sharply decline; the supply of imported goods was kept to a low minimum and the county was forced to export everything it could, including coal necessary for basic heating and power plants. [[Power outage]]s were commonplace. By 1980, the debt accounted to over US$23 billion, then almost half of Poland's [[nominal GDP]].        \n\n[[File:Jimmy Carter and Edward Gierek First Secretary of Poland - NARA - 177308.tif|thumb|right|230px|[[Edward Gierek]] (right) with President [[Jimmy Carter]] (left) during his state visit to Warsaw, 1977. The loans and Solidarity were among the chief topics discussed]]\n\nAt the same time, the newly-founded [[Solidarity movement]] encouraged farmers to refrain from selling agricultural products (wheat, grain, fruit and others) to the state as a sign of protest. The actual lack of goods on the market and in stores was caused by the fact that production stopped due to the strikes organized by Solidarity. In 1980, the national income fell by 6% compared to previous year, and in 1981 by 12%. The number of exports declined by 4.2%. Mismanagement and wastefulness were abundant. \n\nOn 6 September 1980, Gierek was dismissed from his office, expelled from the Polish United Workers' Party (possibly under the pressure from the Soviet Union) and falsely charged with [[corruption]]. A year later, on 10 September 1981, the Soviet authorities informed the Polish government that in connection with the prevailing situation in Poland the USSR would cut oil supply to Poland by 64% and gas by 47%. The import of [[diesel]] from the Soviet Union was terminated immediately. This action was intended to force the Polish communist authorities to suppress the demonstrations and dissolve Solidarity. The situation was already dire and gradually worsened, which only fueled anti-communist sentiment. A [[civil war]] was hanging by a thread.\n\nIn 1981, Poland notified [[Club de Paris]] (a group of Western-European central banks) about its [[insolvency]], which caught the attention of the entire world.<ref>http://www.clubdeparis.org/en/traitements/poland-27-04-1981/en</ref>\n\n==Introduction, restrictions, patrols==\n===Secret preparations and provocation===\n[[File:Wojciech Jaruzelski.jpg|thumb|left|150px|General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski|Jaruzelski]] was determined to suppress any opposition along with the [[Solidarity Movement]]]]\nAfter the short tenure of [[Stanis\u0142aw Kania]], General and Minister of Defence [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] was chosen as the new First Secretary. Before assuming office, Jaruzelski ordered the Polish General Staff to update plans for a nationwide martial law on 22 October 1980.<ref>''From Solidarity to Martial Law: The Polish Crisis of 1980\u20131981: A Documentary History'' by Andrzej Paczkowski, Malcolm Byrne. Central European University Press, Budapest 2007. p. xxxiii</ref> In November 1980, the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Poland)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] planned to potentially facilitate around 12,900 members of the opposition in state prisons and places of internment. \n\nOn 5 December 1980, Kania spoke of the preparations relating to martial law at the [[Warsaw Pact|Warsaw Pact Summit]] in [[Moscow]]. He presented his own view of how to weaken Solidarity and insisted that a \"psychological-operational method\" would be most appropriate to prevent violence. This method entailed strong [[propaganda]] against the movement and deploying [[S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa|Secret Services (SB)]] to go undercover and infiltrate Solidarity headquarters in the hope of creating internal conflicts within the opposition. General Jaruzelski was not fully satisfied with the plan, and, in case of failure, already planned radical actions involving the army. Stanis\u0142aw Kania warned [[Brezhnev]] that an armed intervention from the Soviet side to aid Jaruzelski would be met \"with a violent reaction, or even with a national uprising\" that would shake the politics of the Eastern Bloc.     \n\n[[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], chief security advisor to US President [[Jimmy Carter]], stated that \"if the Soviet Union would undertake an armed intervention in Poland, the US would strike back in a [[riposte]] manner\". According to historian and publicist [[Paul Kengor]], the then US President [[Ronald Reagan]] considered sending American troops to Poland to scare off the Soviets.<ref>https://wyborcza.pl/1,75399,3976852.html</ref> This claim was not supported by Brzezinski nor by [[Richard Pipes]] from [[Harvard University]].<ref>https://wyborcza.pl/1,75399,3976852.html</ref> Kengor then elaborated that Reagan eventually abandoned the plan after he was convinced by his own advisors that the US army stationed across Europe is less capable and much weaker than the Soviet forces.<ref>https://wyborcza.pl/1,75399,3976852.html</ref> \n\n[[File:WieczorWroclawia20marca1981.jpg|thumb|right|240px|A censored regional newspaper that reported about the [[Bydgoszcz events]], in which the [[Milicja Obywatelska|Militia]] abused Solidarity members. The censorship was to prevent the slander of state services]] \n\nIn February 1981, the [[Ministry of National Defence (Poland)|Ministry of National Defence]] and Ministry of the Internal Affairs carried out a training scenario, the purpose of which was to explore how martial law will be introduced. The ministries agreed that martial law should be preceded by appropriate propaganda calling for its support, and the decision itself should be based on a pretext that it would bring peace and stability for the society. It was also highlighted that martial law must occur before the fully mobilized [[Fighting Solidarity]] and its allies organize a [[general strike]] that would paralyze the entire country. By March, the situation escalated after the [[Bydgoszcz events]], in which local Solidarity delegates invited for a [[National Council (Poland)|Regional National Council]] meeting in [[Bydgoszcz]] to discuss potential strikes were beaten and abused by the [[Citizens' Militia]] (MO). The event, which was to feature in newspapers as a [[provocation]], was concealed by [[censors]]. On 27 March, Solidarity organized a warning strike directed at the government, but, on 30 March, [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]] met with [[Mieczys\u0142aw Rakowski]] and a compromise was achieved. The general strike was called off and the situation stabilized for a short period.\n\nIn July, the Soviets increased their military presence in the military base at [[Borne Sulinowo]], where the [[Red Army]] stationed per [[Warsaw Pact]] agreement as in all other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries. Without notifying the Polish authorities, the Soviets unexpectedly sent over 600 tanks to Borne Sulinowo. A month later, commander-in-chief of the Warsaw Pact, [[Viktor Kulikov]], requested that Soviet military advisors are to be placed in the Polish General Staff and assigned to nearly all Polish regiments. It is suspected that Kulikov, acting on behalf of the Soviet Union, was tasked with sending undercover [[KGB]] agents to monitor the situation in Poland from the Polish military's perspective. His request, however, was immediately denied by the Polish government.<ref name=\"Ryszard Kukli\u0144ski. \u017bycie \u015bci\u015ble tajne\">{{cite book |surname=Benjamin Weiser |title=Ryszard Kukli\u0144ski. \u017bycie \u015bci\u015ble tajne |publisher=\u015awiat Ksi\u0105\u017cki |location=Warszawa |year=2005 |isbn = 83-7391-673-3}}</ref> \n\nOver 25,000 posters announcing martial law were secretly printed in the USSR, transported to Poland by airplane and hidden in the large building housing the Ministry of Internal Affairs.<ref>[[Ryszard Terlecki]]: ''Miecz i tarcza komunizmu.

In total, between 70,000 and 80,000 soldiers of the People's Army and 30,000 functionaries of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (including SB, ZOMO and the Militia) were deployed for action. Around 1,750 tanks, 1,400 armoured vehicles, 500 militarized transport units, 9000 cars and several [[helicopter]] [[squadron]]s were in service.<ref>''From Solidarity to Martial Law: The Polish Crisis of 1980\u20131981: A Documentary History'' by Andrzej Paczkowski, Malcolm Byrne. Central European University Press, Budapest 2007. p. xxxiii</ref> 25% of all units concentrated in the capital, Warsaw, or in surrounding localities.       \n\nAfter the introduction of martial law on 13 December 1981, pro-[[democracy]] movements such as [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] and other smaller organisations were banned, and their leaders, including [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]], jailed overnight. In the morning, thousands of soldiers in military vehicles appeared on the streets of every major city. A [[curfew]] was imposed, the national borders sealed, airports closed, and road access to main cities restricted. Telephone lines were disconnected, mail subject to renewed [[postal censorship]], all independent official organizations were criminalized, and classes in schools and universities suspended.\n\nDuring the initial imposition of martial law, several dozen people were killed. Official reports during the crackdown claimed about a dozen fatalities, while a [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland|parliamentary]] commission in the years 1989\u20131991 arrived at a figure of over 90.<ref>[http://wyborcza.pl/1,77062,3787704.html Ofiary stanu wojennego i lat nast\u0119pnych do 1989] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108144638/http://wyborcza.pl/1,77062,3787704.html |date=2014-01-08 }} by Piotr Lipi\u0144ski</ref> In the deadliest incident, nine coal miners were killed by: \"[[ZOMO]]\" paramilitary police during the [[strike-breaking]] at the [[Pacification of Wujek]] on 16 December 1981.

As part of the crackdown, media and educational institutions underwent \"verification\", a process that tested each employee's attitude towards the regime and to the Solidarity movement; as a result, thousands of journalists, teachers and professors were banned from their professions.

Each day delivers new blows to the waning economy./.../<br>The atmosphere of conflicts, misunderstanding, hatred causes moral degradation, surpasses the limits of toleration. Strikes, the readiness to strike, actions of protest have become a norm of life. Even school youth are being drawn into this. Yesterday evening, many public buildings remained seized. The cries are voiced to physical reprisals with the 'reds', with people who have different opinions. <br>The cases of terror, threats and moral vendetta, of even direct violence are on the rise. A wave of impudent crimes, robberies and burglaries is running across the country. The underground business sharks' fortunes, already reaching millions, are growing. Chaos and demoralization have reached the magnitude of a catastrophe. People have reached the limit of psychological toleration. Many people are struck by despair. Not only days, but hours as well are bringing forth the all-national disaster./.../<br>Citizens!<br>The load of responsibility that falls on me on this dramatic moment in the Polish history is huge. It is my duty to take this responsibility - concerning the future of Poland, that my generation fought for on all the fronts of the war and for which they sacrificed the best years of their life.

I wish that everyone understood the motives of our actions. A military coup, military dictatorship is not our goal./.../<br> In longer perspective, none of Poland's problems can be solved with the use of violence. The Military Council of National Salvation does not replace constitutional organs of power. Its only purpose is to keep the legal balance of the country, to create guarantees that give a chance to restore order and discipline. This is the ultimate way to bring the country out of the crisis, to save the country from collapse./.../<br>I appeal to all the citizens. A time of heavy trials has arrived.

Thousands of opposition activists were [[Internment|imprisoned]] without charge and as many as 91 killed.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6175517.stm Poland marks communist crackdown], [[BBC News]], 13 December 2006</ref> Although martial law was lifted in 1983, many of the [[political prisoner]]s were not released until a general [[amnesty]] in 1986.\n\nSince the 1970s, communist Poland was in a deep [[economic recession]]. The First Secretary [[Edward Gierek]] made large incessant loans from western creditors to achieve a better economic output that instead resulted in a domestic crisis. Basic goods were being heavily [[Rationing|rationed]] which acted as a stimuli for the establishment of a first anti-communist [[trade union]] in the [[Eastern Bloc]], known as Solidarity, in 1980. Gierek, who permitted the trade union to appear per the [[Gda\u0144sk Agreement]], was dismissed from his post less than a month later under pressure from the USSR and confined to [[house arrest]]. Poland's already somewhat liberal policies concerning the opposition were worrisome for hardliners in the [[Soviet Union]], who feared that the Poles may overthrow communism and ally themselves with the [[Western Bloc]]. The Soviets were particularly uneasy as the departure of Eastern Bloc's most populous nation from [[Comecon]] would trigger further financial and economic problems that would bring an end to communist rule in Central-Eastern Europe. After a series of strikes and demonstrations by employees of chief industrial regions, Poland was directly heading towards bankruptcy. \n\nThe [[Military Council of National Salvation]] was formed by the new First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], who was determined to put an end to the demonstrations and crush the opposition by force if necessary. There is speculation whether Jaruzelski instigated martial law to prevent bloodshed if the Soviets and other [[Warsaw Pact]] countries were to enter Poland under the mutual assistance treaty, like in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and the [[invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968]]. On 13 December 1981, Jaruzelski announced the introduction of martial law in a televised speech addressed to the entire nation. The Polish People's Army, [[Citizen's Militia]] (MO), [[ZOMO]] special units and tanks rolled onto the streets to scare off demonstrators, begin regular patrols and maintain [[curfew]]. Intercity travelling was forbidden unless a permit was granted by the authorities, food shortages intensified and censorship was placed on all media and [[post]]. The [[S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa|secret services (SB)]] [[wiretapped]] phones in public booths and state institutions. \n\nOn 16 December, pro-Solidarity miners organized a strike against the declaration of the martial law at the [[Wujek Coal Mine]] in the industrial city of [[Katowice]]. The ZOMO squads, nicknamed \"Communist [[Gestapo]]\" by the opposition, brutally [[Pacification of Wujek|pacified Wujek]], which resulted in the deaths of 9 miners. All other [[1982 demonstrations in Poland|demonstrations across Poland]] were met with armed force of the services, which utilized [[water cannons]], [[tear gas]], [[Baton (law enforcement)|batons]], truncheons and clubs to disperse crowds and beat protesters. Thousands were detained and some were tortured in state prisons. On 31 August 1982, in the copper-mining town of [[Lubin]], 3 people were mortally wounded by ZOMO. Until the end of the martial law on 22 July 1983, approximately 91 people were killed, though this figure varies and is still debated among historians.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6175517.stm Poland marks communist crackdown], [[BBC News]], 13 December 2006</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\n{{main|History of Poland (1945\u20131989)}}\n===Reforms of Edward Gierek (1970-1975)===\n[[File:Photograph of President Gerald R.

Gierek, a more [[Liberalism|liberal]] figure than his predecessor, was determined to make [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] the wealthiest and most economically significant communist country of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. However, these ideas prompted resistance from hardline communist leadership as the reform would effectively abandon the fundamental principles of a [[Planned economy|centrally planned]] [[Marxism|Marxist]] economy. The grip and emphasis on state-owned enterprises and state-controlled prices or trade was eventually loosened. Small private businesses began to appear and Poland recorded temporary growth in [[GDP]] and an improvement in living conditions. \n\nGierek maintained close ties with the [[United States]], which he subsequently used for diplomatic and economic purposes. In order to continue with the reforms, large sums of money were borrowed from [[creditors]] in the [[Western Bloc]]. These sequential and uninterrupted loans were primarily targeted at establishing heavy industry, mines or manufacturing facilities that would produce goods for [[export]]. The projected income from the exports would then be used to pay off the [[debt]]. Apart from financing the economic sector, the money was spent on [[social housing]] and on expanding road connections, for example the first fully operational [[highway]] linking Warsaw with industrial [[Silesia]] was opened for traffic in 1976. Furthermore, over 1.8 million [[plattenbau]] flats were constructed to house the growing population. Agricultural output rose by 22% between 1971 and 1975. Gierek also initiated the construction of [[Warszawa Centralna]], Europe's most modern railway station at the time.\n\n===Crisis; debt, rationing and shortages (1976-1981)===\n[[File:Kartka cukier 1kg 07-76.jpg|thumb|left|140px|A ration card for sugar, 1976]]\nAs expenditures increased and debts accumulated, the West would no longer grant Poland loans. Moreover, the [[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 oil crisis|1979 oil crises]] affected the fragile economy. Due to previous GDP growth, higher income and expanded industries, the demand for certain goods and [[consumption]] surged. New factories and state enterprises required fuel, materials and a workforce to operate production lines. Soon, the country started exporting locally-produced stock designated for the Polish populace, thus resulting in widespread [[shortages]]. Because the remaining assets were directed at production, exports and debt repayment, the state also reduced imports to minimize expenses. \n\nIn 1976, the communist government introduced [[ration cards]] for sugar, meat, processed food and dairy. Confectionery, [[cocoa]], coffee, rice, [[tobacco]] and other goods not produced in Poland were so heavily rationed that they were almost permanently unavailable. The living standards began to sharply decline; the supply of imported goods was kept to a low minimum and the county was forced to export everything it could, including coal necessary for basic heating and power plants. [[Power outage]]s were commonplace. By 1980, the debt accounted to over US$23 billion, then almost half of Poland's [[nominal GDP]].        \n\n[[File:Jimmy Carter and Edward Gierek First Secretary of Poland - NARA - 177308.tif|thumb|right|230px|[[Edward Gierek]] (right) with President [[Jimmy Carter]] (left) during his state visit to Warsaw, 1977. The loans and Solidarity were among the chief topics discussed]]\n\nAt the same time, the newly-founded [[Solidarity movement]] encouraged farmers to refrain from selling agricultural products (wheat, grain, fruit and others) to the state as a sign of protest. The actual lack of goods on the market and in stores was caused by the fact that production stopped due to the strikes organized by Solidarity. In 1980, the national income fell by 6% compared to previous year, and in 1981 by 12%. The number of exports declined by 4.2%. Mismanagement and wastefulness were abundant. \n\nOn 6 September 1980, Gierek was dismissed from his office, expelled from the Polish United Workers' Party (possibly under the pressure from the Soviet Union) and falsely charged with [[corruption]]. A year later, on 10 September 1981, the Soviet authorities informed the Polish government that in connection with the prevailing situation in Poland the USSR would cut oil supply to Poland by 64% and gas by 47%. The import of [[diesel]] from the Soviet Union was terminated immediately. This action was intended to force the Polish communist authorities to suppress the demonstrations and dissolve Solidarity. The situation was already dire and gradually worsened, which only fueled anti-communist sentiment. A [[civil war]] was hanging by a thread.\n\nIn 1981, Poland notified [[Club de Paris]] (a group of Western-European central banks) about its [[insolvency]], which caught the attention of the entire world.<ref>http://www.clubdeparis.org/en/traitements/poland-27-04-1981/en</ref>\n\n==Introduction, restrictions, patrols==\n===Secret preparations and provocation===\n[[File:Wojciech Jaruzelski.jpg|thumb|left|150px|General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski|Jaruzelski]] was determined to suppress any opposition along with the [[Solidarity Movement]]]]\nAfter the short tenure of [[Stanis\u0142aw Kania]], General and Minister of Defence [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] was chosen as the new First Secretary. Before assuming office, Jaruzelski ordered the Polish General Staff to update plans for a nationwide martial law on 22 October 1980.<ref>''From Solidarity to Martial Law: The Polish Crisis of 1980\u20131981: A Documentary History'' by Andrzej Paczkowski, Malcolm Byrne. Central European University Press, Budapest 2007. p. xxxiii</ref> In November 1980, the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Poland)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] planned to potentially facilitate around 12,900 members of the opposition in state prisons and places of internment. \n\nOn 5 December 1980, Kania spoke of the preparations relating to martial law at the [[Warsaw Pact|Warsaw Pact Summit]] in [[Moscow]]. He presented his own view of how to weaken Solidarity and insisted that a \"psychological-operational method\" would be most appropriate to prevent violence. This method entailed strong [[propaganda]] against the movement and deploying [[S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa|Secret Services (SB)]] to go undercover and infiltrate Solidarity headquarters in the hope of creating internal conflicts within the opposition. General Jaruzelski was not fully satisfied with the plan, and, in case of failure, already planned radical actions involving the army. Stanis\u0142aw Kania warned [[Brezhnev]] that an armed intervention from the Soviet side to aid Jaruzelski would be met \"with a violent reaction, or even with a national uprising\" that would shake the politics of the Eastern Bloc.     \n\n[[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], chief security advisor to US President [[Jimmy Carter]], stated that \"if the Soviet Union would undertake an armed intervention in Poland, the US would strike back in a [[riposte]] manner\". According to historian and publicist [[Paul Kengor]], the then US President [[Ronald Reagan]] considered sending American troops to Poland to scare off the Soviets.<ref>https://wyborcza.pl/1,75399,3976852.html</ref> This claim was not supported by Brzezinski nor by [[Richard Pipes]] from [[Harvard University]].<ref>https://wyborcza.pl/1,75399,3976852.html</ref> Kengor then elaborated that Reagan eventually abandoned the plan after he was convinced by his own advisors that the US army stationed across Europe is less capable and much weaker than the Soviet forces.<ref>https://wyborcza.pl/1,75399,3976852.html</ref> \n\n[[File:WieczorWroclawia20marca1981.jpg|thumb|right|240px|A censored regional newspaper that reported about the [[Bydgoszcz events]], in which the [[Milicja Obywatelska|Militia]] abused Solidarity members. The censorship was to prevent the slander of state services]] \n\nIn February 1981, the [[Ministry of National Defence (Poland)|Ministry of National Defence]] and Ministry of the Internal Affairs carried out a training scenario, the purpose of which was to explore how martial law will be introduced. The ministries agreed that martial law should be preceded by appropriate propaganda calling for its support, and the decision itself should be based on a pretext that it would bring peace and stability for the society. It was also highlighted that martial law must occur before the fully mobilized [[Fighting Solidarity]] and its allies organize a [[general strike]] that would paralyze the entire country. By March, the situation escalated after the [[Bydgoszcz events]], in which local Solidarity delegates invited for a [[National Council (Poland)|Regional National Council]] meeting in [[Bydgoszcz]] to discuss potential strikes were beaten and abused by the [[Citizens' Militia]] (MO). The event, which was to feature in newspapers as a [[provocation]], was concealed by [[censors]]. On 27 March, Solidarity organized a warning strike directed at the government, but, on 30 March, [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]] met with [[Mieczys\u0142aw Rakowski]] and a compromise was achieved. The general strike was called off and the situation stabilized for a short period.\n\nIn July, the Soviets increased their military presence in the military base at [[Borne Sulinowo]], where the [[Red Army]] stationed per [[Warsaw Pact]] agreement as in all other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries. Without notifying the Polish authorities, the Soviets unexpectedly sent over 600 tanks to Borne Sulinowo. A month later, commander-in-chief of the Warsaw Pact, [[Viktor Kulikov]], requested that Soviet military advisors are to be placed in the Polish General Staff and assigned to nearly all Polish regiments. It is suspected that Kulikov, acting on behalf of the Soviet Union, was tasked with sending undercover [[KGB]] agents to monitor the situation in Poland from the Polish military's perspective.

In total, between 70,000 and 80,000 soldiers of the People's army and 30,000 functionaries of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (including SB, ZOMO and the Militia) were deployed for action.

In the morning, thousands of soldiers in military vehicles appeared on the streets of every major city. A [[curfew]] was imposed, the national borders sealed, airports closed, and road access to main cities restricted. Telephone lines were disconnected, mail subject to renewed [[postal censorship]], all independent official organizations were criminalized, and classes in schools and universities suspended.\n\nDuring the initial imposition of martial law, several dozen people were killed. Official reports during the crackdown claimed about a dozen fatalities, while a [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland|parliamentary]] commission in the years 1989\u20131991 arrived at a figure of over 90.<ref>[http://wyborcza.pl/1,77062,3787704.html Ofiary stanu wojennego i lat nast\u0119pnych do 1989] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108144638/http://wyborcza.pl/1,77062,3787704.html |date=2014-01-08 }} by Piotr Lipi\u0144ski</ref> In the deadliest incident, nine coal miners were killed by: \"[[ZOMO]]\" paramilitary police during the [[strike-breaking]] at the [[Pacification of Wujek]] on 16 December 1981.

As part of the crackdown, media and educational institutions underwent \"verification\", a process that tested each employee's attitude towards the regime and to the Solidarity movement; as a result, thousands of journalists, teachers and professors were banned from their professions.

I address you concerning extraordinarily important questions. Our homeland is at the edge of an abyss. The achievements of many generations and the Polish home that has been built up from the dust are about to turn into ruins. State structures are ceasing to function. Each day delivers new blows to the waning economy./.../<br>The atmosphere of conflicts, misunderstanding, hatred causes moral degradation, surpasses the limits of toleration. Strikes, the readiness to strike, actions of protest have become a norm of life. Even school youth are being drawn into this. Yesterday evening, many public buildings remained seized. The cries are voiced to physical reprisals with the 'reds', with people who have different opinions. <br>The cases of terror, threats and moral vendetta, of even direct violence are on the rise. A wave of impudent crimes, robberies and burglaries is running across the country. The underground business sharks' fortunes, already reaching millions, are growing. Chaos and demoralization have reached the magnitude of a catastrophe. People have reached the limit of psychological toleration. Many people are struck by despair. Not only days, but hours as well are bringing forth the all-national disaster./.../<br>Citizens!<br>The load of responsibility that falls on me on this dramatic moment in the Polish history is huge. It is my duty to take this responsibility - concerning the future of Poland, that my generation fought for on all the fronts of the war and for which they sacrificed the best years of their life. I declare, that today the Military Council of National Salvation has been formed. In accordance with the Constitution, the State Council has imposed martial law all over the country. I wish that everyone understood the motives of our actions. A military coup, military dictatorship is not our goal./.../<br> In longer perspective, none of Poland's problems can be solved with the use of violence. The Military Council of National Salvation does not replace constitutional organs of power. Its only purpose is to keep the legal balance of the country, to create guarantees that give a chance to restore order and discipline. This is the ultimate way to bring the country out of the crisis, to save the country from collapse./.../<br>I appeal to all the citizens. A time of heavy trials has arrived. And we have to stand those in order to prove that we are worthy of Poland.<br>Before all the Polish people and the whole world I would like to repeat the immortal words: <br>\n::'''''[[Poland Is Not Yet Lost|Poland has not yet perished, so long as we still live]]!'''''</blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Able Archer 83]]\n* [[Fighting Solidarity]]\n* [[Pacification of Wujek]]\n* [[Polish 1970 protests]]\n* [[Pozna\u0144 1956 protests]]\n* [[Romanian Revolution]], 1989\n* [[Soviet reaction to the Polish Crisis of 1980-1981]]\n* [[Telephone tapping in the Eastern Bloc]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Leopold Labedz, ''Poland Under Jaruzelski: A Comprehensive Sourcebook on Poland During and After Martial Law''\n* George Sanford, ''Military Rule in Poland: The Rebuilding of Communist Power, 1981\u20131983''\n{{Portal|Poland|History|Communism|War|1980s}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Martial law in Poland}}\n* [http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB211/index.htm Solidarity and Martial Law in Poland: 25 Years Later], [[National Security Archive]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110112170636/http://www.onwar.com/aced/chrono/c1900s/yr80/fpoland1981.htm Martial Law in Poland 1981-1983]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080105033603/http://www.tenetour.com/history9.php Martial Law in Poland]\n* [http://www.videofact.com/english/stanwoj2.htm Martial Law in Poland 1981]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKhITm9-5TU Video of Jaruzelski declaring martial law], [[Telewizja Polska|TVP]]/[[YouTube]]\n* [http://www.pbase.com/zyziza/martial_law_in_poland Photo Gallery by zyziza at pbase.com]\n\n{{History of the People's Republic of Poland}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Martial Law In Poland}}\n[[Category:1980s coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts]]\n[[Category:1981 in Poland]]\n[[Category:1981 in politics]]\n[[Category:1982 in Poland]]\n[[Category:1982 in politics]]\n[[Category:1983 in Poland]]\n[[Category:1983 in politics]]\n[[Category:Anti-communism in Poland]]\n[[Category:Communism in Poland]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1981]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1982]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1983]]\n[[Category:Emergency laws]]\n[[Category:Martial law|Poland]]\n[[Category:Military coups in Poland]]\n[[Category:Military dictatorships|Poland]]\n[[Category:Poland\u2013Soviet Union relations]]\n[[Category:Solidarity (Polish trade union)]]\n", "name_user": "Oliszydlowski", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e13 December 1981", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law_in_Poland"}
