How one language signs a certain number would be different than how another language signs it<ref name=\":04\" />. British Sign Language is described as a 'spatial language' as it \"moves signs in space<ref name=\":04\" />.\"\n\n=== Phonology ===\nLike many other [[sign language]]s, BSL [[phonology]] is defined by elements such as handshape, orientation, location, movement, and non-manual features. There are phonological components to sign language that have no meaning alone but work together to create a meaning of a signed word: hand shape, movement, location, orientation and facial expression <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Morgan|first=Gary|date=October 2006|title='Children Are Just Lingual': The Development of Phonology in British Sign Language (BSL).|url=|journal=Lingua|volume=116|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":04\"/>. The meanings of words differ if one of these components is changed<ref name=\":1\" /> <ref name=\":04\"/>.

A proform is \u201c...any form that stands in the place of, or does the job of, some other form.<ref name=\":04\"/>\u201d Sentences are composed of two parts, in order: the subject and the predicate<ref name=\":04\"/>. The subject is the topic of the sentence, while the predicate is the commentary about the subject.<ref name=\":04\"/>\n\nBSL uses a [[topic\u2013comment]] structure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cohearentvision.org.uk/deaf-users/grammatical-structure-of-british-sign-language/|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130423190807/http://www.cohearentvision.org.uk/deaf-users/grammatical-structure-of-british-sign-language/|url-status=dead|title=Grammatical Structure of British Sign Language \u00b7 coHearentVision|date=23 April 2013|archivedate=23 April 2013|website=archive.is}}</ref> Topic-comment means that the topic of the signed conversation is first established, followed by an elaboration of the topic, being the \u2018comment\u2019 component<ref name=\":04\"/>.

Kennedy (2000). Lexical Comparison of Signs from American, Australian, British, and New Zealand Sign Languages. In K. Emmorey and H. Lane (Eds), \"The signs of language revisited: an anthology to honor Ursula Bellugi and Edward Klima\". Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.</ref> BSL is also distinct from [[Irish Sign Language]] (ISL) (ISG in the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] system) which is more closely related to [[French Sign Language]] (LSF) and ASL.\n\nIt is also distinct from [[Signed English]], a manually coded method expressed to represent the [[English language]].\n\nThe sign languages used in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], [[Auslan]] and [[New Zealand Sign Language]], respectively, evolved largely from 19th century BSL, and all retain the same manual alphabet and grammar and possess similar lexicons. These three languages may technically be considered dialects of a single language ([[BANZSL]]) due to their use of the same grammar and manual alphabet and the high degree of lexical sharing (overlap of signs). The term BANZSL was coined by [[Trevor Johnston]]<ref>Johnston, T. (2002). BSL, Auslan and NZSL: Three sign languages or one? In A. Baker, B. van den Bogaerde & O. Crasborn (Eds.), \"Cross-linguistic perspectives in sign language research: Selected papers from TISLR 2000\" (pp. 47-69). Hamburg: Signum Verlag.</ref> and Adam Schembri.\n\nIn Australia deaf schools were established by educated deaf people from London, Edinburgh and Dublin. This introduced the London and Edinburgh dialects of BSL to Melbourne and Sydney respectively and Irish Sign Language to Sydney in Roman Catholic schools for the deaf. The language contact post secondary education between Australian ISL users and 'Australian BSL' users accounts for some of the dialectal differences we see between modern BSL and Auslan. Tertiary education in the US for some deaf Australian adults also accounts for some ASL borrowings found in modern Auslan.\n\nAuslan, BSL and NZSL have 82% of signs identical (using concepts from a [[Swadesh list]]). When considering similar or related signs as well as identical, they are 98% cognate. Further information will be available after the completion of the [http://www.bslcorpusproject.org BSL corpus] is completed and allows for comparison with the [http://www.auslan.org.au/about/corpus/ Auslan corpus] and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20081224104404/http://www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/research/deafstudies/DSRU%20site/NZSL%20variation/variation%20project.aspx Sociolinguistic Variation in New Zealand Sign Language project ]. There continues to be language contact between BSL, Auslan and NZSL through migration (deaf people and interpreters), the media (television programmes such as See Hear, Switch, Rush and SignPost are often recorded and shared informally in all three countries) and conferences (the World Federation of the Deaf Conference \u2013 WFD \u2013 in Brisbane 1999 saw many British deaf people travelling to Australia).\n\n[[Makaton]], a communication system for people with cognitive impairments or other communication difficulties, was originally developed with signs borrowed from British Sign Language. The sign language used in [[Sri Lanka]] is also closely related to BSL despite the oral language not being English, demonstrating the distance between sign languages and spoken ones.\n\nBSL users campaigned [[Recognition of sign languages|to have BSL recognised]] on an official level. BSL was recognised as a language in its own right by the UK government on 18 March 2003, but it has no legal protection. There is, however, legislation requiring the provision of interpreters such as the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.\n\n== Usage ==\nBSL has many regional [[dialect]]s. Certain signs used in [[Scotland]], for example, may not be understood immediately, or not understood at all, by those in Southern England, or vice versa. Some signs are even more local, occurring only in certain towns or cities (such as the Manchester system of number signs). Likewise, some may go in or out of fashion, or evolve over time, just as terms in oral languages do.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Linguistics of British Sign Language: An Introduction|last = Sutton-Spence|first = Rachel|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1998|isbn = 0521631424|location = |pages = 24\u201325|url = https://books.google.com/?id=lUsCbazTICIC&lpg=PR9&dq=british%20sign%20language%20older&pg=PA24#v=onepage&q&f=false|last2 = Woll|first2 = Bencie}}</ref> Families may have signs unique to them to accommodate for certain situations or to describe an object that may otherwise require fingerspelling.\n\nMany British television channels broadcast programmes with in-vision signing, using BSL, as well as specially made programmes aimed mainly at [[Deaf culture|deaf]] people such as the [[BBC]]'s ''[[See Hear]]'' and [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[VEE-TV]]''.\n\n[[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News]] broadcasts in-vision signing at 07:00-07:45, 08:00-08:20 and 13:00-13:45 GMT/BST each weekday. [[BBC Two]] also broadcasts in-vision signed repeats of the channel's primetime programmes between 00:00 and 02:00 each weekday. All BBC channels (excluding BBC One, BBC Alba and BBC Parliament) provide in-vision signing for some of their programmes.\n\nBSL is used in some educational establishments, but is not always the policy for deaf children in some local authority areas. The Let's Sign BSL and [[fingerspelling]] graphics are being developed for use in education by deaf educators and tutors and include many of the regional signs referred to above.\n\nIn 2019, over 100 signs for scientific terms, including '[[deoxyribonucleotide]]' and '[[deoxyribonucleoside]]', were added to BSL, after being conceived by Liam Mcmulkin, a deaf graduate of the [[University of Dundee]], who had found finger-spelling such words tiresome, during his degree course.<ref name=\"Martin\">{{cite web |last1=Martin |first1=Hazel |title=What's deoxyribonucleotide in sign language? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-49057331 |accessdate=3 August 2019 |date=21 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Number of BSL users ==\nIn 2016 the British Deaf Association says that, based on official statistics, it believes there are 151,000 people who use BSL in the UK, and 87,000 of these are deaf. This figure does not include professional BSL users, interpreters, translators, etc. unless they use BSL at home.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bda.org.uk/bsl-statistics|title=British Sign Language (BSL) Statistics|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Learning British Sign Language ==\nBritish Sign Language can be learnt throughout the UK and three examination systems exist.  Courses are provided by community colleges, local centres for deaf people and private organisations.  Most tutors are native users of sign language{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} and hold a relevant teaching qualification.\n\n=== Becoming a BSL / English interpreter ===\nThere are two qualification routes: via post-graduate studies, or via [[National Vocational Qualifications]].  [[Deaf Studies]] undergraduate courses with specific streams for sign language interpreting exist at several British universities; post-graduate level interpreting diplomas are also on offer from universities and one private company. Course entry requirements vary from no previous knowledge of BSL to NVQ level 6 BSL (or equivalent).\n\nThe qualification process allows interpreters to register with the National Registers of Communication Professionals with Deaf and Deafblind People (NRCPD), a voluntary regulator. Registrants are asked to self-certify that they have both cleared a DBS ([[Disclosure and Barring Service]]) check and are covered by professional indemnity insurance. Completing a level 3 BSL language assessment and enrolling on an approved interpreting course allows applications to register as a TSLI (Trainee Sign Language Interpreter). After completing an approved interpreting course, trainees can then apply to achieve RSLI (Registered Sign Language Interpreter) status. RSLIs are currently required by NRCPD to log Continuous Professional Development activities. Post-qualification, specialist training is still considered necessary to work in specific critical domains.\n\n=== Communication Support Workers ===\nCommunication Support Workers (CSWs) are professionals who support the communication of deaf students in education at all ages, and deaf people in many areas of work, using British Sign Language and other communication methods such as [[Sign Supported English]]. The qualifications and experience of CSWs varies: some are fully qualified interpreters, others are not.\n\n==Let Sign Shine==\nLet Sign Shine is a campaign started by Norfolk teenager Jade Chapman to raise the awareness of British Sign Language (BSL) and attract signatures for a petition for BSL to be taught in schools. The campaign's petition to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] has attracted support from over four thousand people.\n\nChapman was nominated for the Bernard Matthews Youth Award 2014 for her work and devotion to raising awareness of the importance of sign language. Chapman won the education award category and was presented with an award by Olympic swimmer [[Rebecca Adlington]].<ref>East Anglian Daily Press, [http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/photo_gallery_incredible_young_people_from_norfolk_and_suffolk_are_honoured_with_special_awards_1_3824453], Photo Gallery: Incredible young people from Norfolk and Suffolk are honoured with special awards.</ref>\n\nChapman was also awarded an Outstanding Achievement Award from the [[Radio Norwich 99.9]] Local Hero Awards on 7 October 2015.

How one language signs a certain number would be different than how another language signs it<ref name=\":04\" />. British Sign Language is described as a 'spatial language' as it \"moves signs in space<ref name=\":04\" />.\"\n\n=== Phonology ===\nLike many other [[sign language]]s, BSL [[phonology]] is defined by elements such as handshape, orientation, location, movement, and non-manual features. There are phonological components to sign language that have no meaning alone but work together to create a meaning of a signed word: hand shape, movement, location, orientation and facial expression <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Morgan|first=Gary|date=October 2006|title='Children Are Just Lingual': The Development of Phonology in British Sign Language (BSL).|url=|journal=Lingua|volume=116|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":04\"/>.

BSL has a particular [[syntax]]<ref name=\":04\"/>. One important component of BSL is its use of [[Pro-form|proforms]]<ref name=\":04\"/>. A proform is \u201c...any form that stands in the place of, or does the job of, some other form.<ref name=\":04\"/>\u201d Sentences are composed of two parts, in order: the subject and the predicate<ref name=\":04\"/>. The subject is the topic of the sentence, while the predicate is the commentary about the subject<ref name=\":04\"/>.\n\nBSL uses a [[topic\u2013comment]] structure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cohearentvision.org.uk/deaf-users/grammatical-structure-of-british-sign-language/|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130423190807/http://www.cohearentvision.org.uk/deaf-users/grammatical-structure-of-british-sign-language/|url-status=dead|title=Grammatical Structure of British Sign Language \u00b7 coHearentVision|date=23 April 2013|archivedate=23 April 2013|website=archive.is}}</ref> Topic-comment means that the topic of the signed conversation is first established, followed by an elaboration of the topic, being the \u2018comment\u2019 component<ref name=\":04\"/>.

Kennedy (2000). Lexical Comparison of Signs from American, Australian, British, and New Zealand Sign Languages. In K. Emmorey and H. Lane (Eds), \"The signs of language revisited: an anthology to honor Ursula Bellugi and Edward Klima\". Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.</ref> BSL is also distinct from [[Irish Sign Language]] (ISL) (ISG in the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] system) which is more closely related to [[French Sign Language]] (LSF) and ASL.\n\nIt is also distinct from [[Signed English]], a manually coded method expressed to represent the [[English language]].\n\nThe sign languages used in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], [[Auslan]] and [[New Zealand Sign Language]], respectively, evolved largely from 19th century BSL, and all retain the same manual alphabet and grammar and possess similar lexicons. These three languages may technically be considered dialects of a single language ([[BANZSL]]) due to their use of the same grammar and manual alphabet and the high degree of lexical sharing (overlap of signs). The term BANZSL was coined by [[Trevor Johnston]]<ref>Johnston, T. (2002). BSL, Auslan and NZSL: Three sign languages or one? In A. Baker, B. van den Bogaerde & O. Crasborn (Eds.), \"Cross-linguistic perspectives in sign language research: Selected papers from TISLR 2000\" (pp. 47-69). Hamburg: Signum Verlag.</ref> and Adam Schembri.\n\nIn Australia deaf schools were established by educated deaf people from London, Edinburgh and Dublin. This introduced the London and Edinburgh dialects of BSL to Melbourne and Sydney respectively and Irish Sign Language to Sydney in Roman Catholic schools for the deaf. The language contact post secondary education between Australian ISL users and 'Australian BSL' users accounts for some of the dialectal differences we see between modern BSL and Auslan. Tertiary education in the US for some deaf Australian adults also accounts for some ASL borrowings found in modern Auslan.\n\nAuslan, BSL and NZSL have 82% of signs identical (using concepts from a [[Swadesh list]]). When considering similar or related signs as well as identical, they are 98% cognate. Further information will be available after the completion of the [http://www.bslcorpusproject.org BSL corpus] is completed and allows for comparison with the [http://www.auslan.org.au/about/corpus/ Auslan corpus] and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20081224104404/http://www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/research/deafstudies/DSRU%20site/NZSL%20variation/variation%20project.aspx Sociolinguistic Variation in New Zealand Sign Language project ]. There continues to be language contact between BSL, Auslan and NZSL through migration (deaf people and interpreters), the media (television programmes such as See Hear, Switch, Rush and SignPost are often recorded and shared informally in all three countries) and conferences (the World Federation of the Deaf Conference \u2013 WFD \u2013 in Brisbane 1999 saw many British deaf people travelling to Australia).\n\n[[Makaton]], a communication system for people with cognitive impairments or other communication difficulties, was originally developed with signs borrowed from British Sign Language. The sign language used in [[Sri Lanka]] is also closely related to BSL despite the oral language not being English, demonstrating the distance between sign languages and spoken ones.\n\nBSL users campaigned [[Recognition of sign languages|to have BSL recognised]] on an official level. BSL was recognised as a language in its own right by the UK government on 18 March 2003, but it has no legal protection. There is, however, legislation requiring the provision of interpreters such as the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.\n\n== Usage ==\nBSL has many regional [[dialect]]s. Certain signs used in [[Scotland]], for example, may not be understood immediately, or not understood at all, by those in Southern England, or vice versa. Some signs are even more local, occurring only in certain towns or cities (such as the Manchester system of number signs). Likewise, some may go in or out of fashion, or evolve over time, just as terms in oral languages do.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Linguistics of British Sign Language: An Introduction|last = Sutton-Spence|first = Rachel|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1998|isbn = 0521631424|location = |pages = 24\u201325|url = https://books.google.com/?id=lUsCbazTICIC&lpg=PR9&dq=british%20sign%20language%20older&pg=PA24#v=onepage&q&f=false|last2 = Woll|first2 = Bencie}}</ref> Families may have signs unique to them to accommodate for certain situations or to describe an object that may otherwise require fingerspelling.\n\nMany British television channels broadcast programmes with in-vision signing, using BSL, as well as specially made programmes aimed mainly at [[Deaf culture|deaf]] people such as the [[BBC]]'s ''[[See Hear]]'' and [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[VEE-TV]]''.\n\n[[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News]] broadcasts in-vision signing at 07:00-07:45, 08:00-08:20 and 13:00-13:45 GMT/BST each weekday. [[BBC Two]] also broadcasts in-vision signed repeats of the channel's primetime programmes between 00:00 and 02:00 each weekday. All BBC channels (excluding BBC One, BBC Alba and BBC Parliament) provide in-vision signing for some of their programmes.\n\nBSL is used in some educational establishments, but is not always the policy for deaf children in some local authority areas. The Let's Sign BSL and [[fingerspelling]] graphics are being developed for use in education by deaf educators and tutors and include many of the regional signs referred to above.\n\nIn 2019, over 100 signs for scientific terms, including '[[deoxyribonucleotide]]' and '[[deoxyribonucleoside]]', were added to BSL, after being conceived by Liam Mcmulkin, a deaf graduate of the [[University of Dundee]], who had found finger-spelling such words tiresome, during his degree course.<ref name=\"Martin\">{{cite web |last1=Martin |first1=Hazel |title=What's deoxyribonucleotide in sign language? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-49057331 |accessdate=3 August 2019 |date=21 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Number of BSL users ==\nIn 2016 the British Deaf Association says that, based on official statistics, it believes there are 151,000 people who use BSL in the UK, and 87,000 of these are deaf. This figure does not include professional BSL users, interpreters, translators, etc. unless they use BSL at home.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bda.org.uk/bsl-statistics|title=British Sign Language (BSL) Statistics|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Learning British Sign Language ==\nBritish Sign Language can be learnt throughout the UK and three examination systems exist.  Courses are provided by community colleges, local centres for deaf people and private organisations.  Most tutors are native users of sign language{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} and hold a relevant teaching qualification.\n\n=== Becoming a BSL / English interpreter ===\nThere are two qualification routes: via post-graduate studies, or via [[National Vocational Qualifications]].  [[Deaf Studies]] undergraduate courses with specific streams for sign language interpreting exist at several British universities; post-graduate level interpreting diplomas are also on offer from universities and one private company. Course entry requirements vary from no previous knowledge of BSL to NVQ level 6 BSL (or equivalent).\n\nThe qualification process allows interpreters to register with the National Registers of Communication Professionals with Deaf and Deafblind People (NRCPD), a voluntary regulator. Registrants are asked to self-certify that they have both cleared a DBS ([[Disclosure and Barring Service]]) check and are covered by professional indemnity insurance. Completing a level 3 BSL language assessment and enrolling on an approved interpreting course allows applications to register as a TSLI (Trainee Sign Language Interpreter). After completing an approved interpreting course, trainees can then apply to achieve RSLI (Registered Sign Language Interpreter) status. RSLIs are currently required by NRCPD to log Continuous Professional Development activities. Post-qualification, specialist training is still considered necessary to work in specific critical domains.\n\n=== Communication Support Workers ===\nCommunication Support Workers (CSWs) are professionals who support the communication of deaf students in education at all ages, and deaf people in many areas of work, using British Sign Language and other communication methods such as [[Sign Supported English]]. The qualifications and experience of CSWs varies: some are fully qualified interpreters, others are not.\n\n==Let Sign Shine==\nLet Sign Shine is a campaign started by Norfolk teenager Jade Chapman to raise the awareness of British Sign Language (BSL) and attract signatures for a petition for BSL to be taught in schools. The campaign's petition to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] has attracted support from over four thousand people.\n\nChapman was nominated for the Bernard Matthews Youth Award 2014 for her work and devotion to raising awareness of the importance of sign language. Chapman won the education award category and was presented with an award by Olympic swimmer [[Rebecca Adlington]].<ref>East Anglian Daily Press, [http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/photo_gallery_incredible_young_people_from_norfolk_and_suffolk_are_honoured_with_special_awards_1_3824453], Photo Gallery: Incredible young people from Norfolk and Suffolk are honoured with special awards.</ref>\n\nChapman was also awarded an Outstanding Achievement Award from the [[Radio Norwich 99.9]] Local Hero Awards on 7 October 2015.

The turnpike begins at the New York state line in [[West Stockbridge, Massachusetts|West Stockbridge]], linking with the Berkshire Connector portion of the [[New York State Thruway]]. Spanning {{convert|138|mi|km}} along an east\u2013west axis, it is entirely [[Concurrency (road)|concurrent]] with the portion of [[Interstate 90]] (I-90) that lies within the state. The turnpike is the longest [[List of Interstate Highways in Massachusetts|Interstate Highway in Massachusetts]], while I-90 in full (which begins nationally in [[Seattle]], Washington) is the longest [[List of Interstate Highways|Interstate Highway in the United States]].\n\nThe turnpike opened in 1957, and it was designated as part of the [[Interstate Highway System]] in 1959. The original western terminus of the turnpike was located at [[Massachusetts Route 102|Route 102]] in West Stockbridge before I-90 had been completed in New York state. The turnpike intersects with several Interstate Highways as it traverses the state, including [[Interstate 91|I-91]] in [[West Springfield, Massachusetts|West Springfield]]; [[Interstate 291 (Massachusetts)|I-291]] in [[Chicopee, Massachusetts|Chicopee]]; [[Interstate 84 in Massachusetts|I-84]] in [[Sturbridge, Massachusetts|Sturbridge]]; the junction of [[Interstate 290 (Massachusetts)|I-290]] and [[Interstate 395 (Connecticut\u2013Massachusetts)|I-395]] in [[Auburn, Massachusetts|Auburn]]; and [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|I-495]] in [[Hopkinton, Massachusetts|Hopkinton]]. The turnpike originally ended at [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|I-95]] in [[Weston, Massachusetts|Weston]]; it was extended to [[Allston]] in 1964, and to the [[Central Artery]] (designated as [[Interstate 93|I-93]], [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|US 1]], and [[Massachusetts Route 3|Route 3]]) in [[Downtown Boston]] in 1965. The \"[[Big Dig]]\" megaproject provided for the construction of the [[Ted Williams Tunnel]], which has carried the turnpike to its eastern terminus at [[Massachusetts Route 1A|Route 1A]] beyond [[Logan International Airport]] since 2003. As an Interstate Highway, the turnpike is supplemented by [[Interstate 190 (Massachusetts)|I-190]] and I-290 as [[List of auxiliary Interstate Highways|auxiliary Interstate Highways]].\n\nThe turnpike was maintained by the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority until the department was replaced by the Highway Division of MassDOT in 2009. The implementation and removal of tolls in some stretches of the turnpike have been controversial; travel between most, but not all, exits requires payment. The [[Fast Lane (E-ZPass)|Fast Lane]] electronic toll collection system was introduced alongside cash payment in 1998; it was later folded into the [[E-ZPass]] branding in 2012.

The original section of the expressway would have connected the then-proposed \"[[Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)|Inner Belt]]\" in [[Boston]] westward to [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]], with connections to [[U.S. Route 20 in Massachusetts|US 20]] and [[Massachusetts Route 30|Route 30]] for outbound traffic. Later extensions of the expressway would continue westward to and through [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]]. Plans for the original expressway included the \"Springfield Bypass\" of US 20 around the [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]] area. Part of this bypass, and the eventual turnpike, used the grading from the never-opened [[Hampden Railroad]]. Similarly, the \"West Stockbridge Bypass\" rerouted [[Massachusetts Route 102|Route 102]] from [[Massachusetts Route 183|Route 183]] in [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts|Stockbridge]] west to Route 102 east by the New York state line in [[West Stockbridge, Massachusetts|West Stockbridge]]; the latter was built before the turnpike itself.\n\nThe Massachusetts Turnpike Authority was created in 1952 by a special act (1952 Acts and Resolves chapter 354; 1952 Senate Doc. 1) of the Massachusetts General Court (legislature)) upon the recommendation of Governor Dever and his Commissioner of Public Works, William F. Callahan. The enabling act was modeled upon that of the Mystic River Bridge Authority (1946 Acts and Resolves chapter 562), but several changes were made that would prove of great importance fifty years later. Callahan served as chairman of the Authority until his death in April 1964.\n\n{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage= | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxVNa6PMHX0 Building the Massachusetts Turnpike], documentary by Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, 1957}}\nConstruction began in 1955, and the whole four-lane road from Route 102 at the state line to [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]] (also [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] in [[Weston, Massachusetts|Weston]]) opened on May 15, 1957.\n\n===Expansion into Boston===\n[[File:NYCRR Headlights Cover 196502XX.png|thumb|right|An aerial photograph of the Boston Extension in the [[New York Central Railroad]] employee magazine ''Headlights'', February 1965]]\n\nEarly considerations for the [[Interstate Highway System]] included routing the transcontinental [[Interstate 90]] along [[Massachusetts Route 2|Route 2]] within Massachusetts, although this alignment in the northern part of the state was too costly. Ultimately, the turnpike in the southern part of the state was approved for Interstate designation, and became concurrent with I-90 in 1959. The [[New York State Thruway#Berkshire Connector|Berkshire Connector]] opened on May 26, 1959, connecting the west end to the [[New York State Thruway]] mainline south of [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. Prior to its opening, traffic used [[New York State Route 22|NY Route 22]] and [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|US&nbsp;20]]. At the Massachusetts/New York state line, one can see where the Turnpike made an abrupt right turn before terminating at Route 102 before the late-May 1959 connection into New York State, as the old pavement still exists for Turnpike Authority and State Police vehicles to access this remote stretch of highway.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=42.347834,-73.41181&sll=42.348427,-73.416138&sspn=0.00915,0.027852&ie=UTF8&t=h&ll=42.348284,-73.41176&spn=0.00915,0.019677&z=18 |title = View }}</ref>\n\nAfter political and legal battles related to the Boston Extension inside Route 128, construction began on March 5, 1962, with the chosen alignment running next to the [[Boston and Albany Railroad]] and reducing that line from four to two tracks.

Part of this was the elimination of the Turnpike Authority. Romney wanted to fold the Turnpike into MassHighway, the state highway department, operated under the Executive Office of Transportation. A first step to this was to replace the Chairman of the Board, [[Matthew J. Amorello]] with someone loyal to the Governor. The Governor has the power to appoint members to the board, but the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] (SJC) advised in an [[advisory opinion]] that \"nothing in G.

|accessdate = June 19, 2017 }}</ref>) is a [[toll road|toll highway]] in the U.S. state of [[Massachusetts]] that is maintained by the [[Massachusetts Department of Transportation]] (MassDOT). The turnpike begins at the New York state line in [[West Stockbridge, Massachusetts|West Stockbridge]], linking with the Berkshire Connector portion of the [[New York State Thruway]]. Spanning {{convert|138|mi|km}} along an east\u2013west axis, it is entirely [[Concurrency (road)|concurrent]] with the portion of [[Interstate 90]] (I-90) that lies within the state. The turnpike is the longest [[List of Interstate Highways in Massachusetts|Interstate Highway in Massachusetts]], while I-90 in full (which begins nationally in [[Seattle]], Washington) is the longest [[List of Interstate Highways|Interstate Highway in the United States]].\n\nThe turnpike opened in 1957, and it was designated as part of the [[Interstate Highway System]] in 1959. The original western terminus of the turnpike was located at [[Massachusetts Route 102|Route 102]] in West Stockbridge before I-90 had been completed in New York state. The turnpike intersects with several Interstate Highways as it traverses the state, including [[Interstate 91|I-91]] in [[West Springfield, Massachusetts|West Springfield]]; [[Interstate 291 (Massachusetts)|I-291]] in [[Chicopee, Massachusetts|Chicopee]]; [[Interstate 84 in Massachusetts|I-84]] in [[Sturbridge, Massachusetts|Sturbridge]]; the junction of [[Interstate 290 (Massachusetts)|I-290]] and [[Interstate 395 (Connecticut\u2013Massachusetts)|I-395]] in [[Auburn, Massachusetts|Auburn]]; and [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|I-495]] in [[Hopkinton, Massachusetts|Hopkinton]]. The turnpike originally ended at [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|I-95]] in [[Weston, Massachusetts|Weston]]; it was extended to [[Allston]] in 1964, and to the [[Central Artery]] (designated as [[Interstate 93|I-93]], [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|US 1]], and [[Massachusetts Route 3|Route 3]]) in [[Downtown Boston]] in 1965. The \"[[Big Dig]]\" megaproject provided for the construction of the [[Ted Williams Tunnel]], which has carried the turnpike to its eastern terminus at [[Massachusetts Route 1A|Route 1A]] beyond [[Logan International Airport]] since 2003. As an Interstate Highway, the turnpike is supplemented by [[Interstate 190 (Massachusetts)|I-190]] and I-290 as [[List of auxiliary Interstate Highways|auxiliary Interstate Highways]].\n\nThe turnpike was maintained by the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority until the department was replaced by the Highway Division of MassDOT in 2009. The implementation and removal of tolls in some stretches of the turnpike have been controversial; travel between most, but not all, exits requires payment. The [[Fast Lane (E-ZPass)|Fast Lane]] electronic toll collection system was introduced alongside cash payment in 1998; it was later folded into the [[E-ZPass]] branding in 2012.

The original section of the expressway would have connected the then-proposed \"[[Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)|Inner Belt]]\" in [[Boston]] westward to [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]], with connections to [[U.S. Route 20 in Massachusetts|US 20]] and [[Massachusetts Route 30|Route 30]] for outbound traffic. Later extensions of the expressway would continue westward to and through [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]]. Plans for the original expressway included the \"Springfield Bypass\" of US 20 around the [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]] area. Part of this bypass, and the eventual turnpike, used the grading from the never-opened [[Hampden Railroad]]. Similarly, the \"West Stockbridge Bypass\" rerouted [[Massachusetts Route 102|Route 102]] from [[Massachusetts Route 183|Route 183]] in [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts|Stockbridge]] west to Route 102 east by the New York state line in [[West Stockbridge, Massachusetts|West Stockbridge]]; the latter was built before the turnpike itself.\n\nThe Massachusetts Turnpike Authority was created in 1952 by a special act (1952 Acts and Resolves chapter 354; 1952 Senate Doc. 1) of the Massachusetts General Court (legislature)) upon the recommendation of Governor Dever and his Commissioner of Public Works, William F. Callahan. The enabling act was modeled upon that of the Mystic River Bridge Authority (1946 Acts and Resolves chapter 562), but several changes were made that would prove of great importance fifty years later. Callahan served as chairman of the Authority until his death in April 1964.\n\n{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage= | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxVNa6PMHX0 Building the Massachusetts Turnpike], documentary by Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, 1957}}\nConstruction began in 1955, and the whole four-lane road from Route 102 at the state line to [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]] (also [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] in [[Weston, Massachusetts|Weston]]) opened on May 15, 1957.\n\n===Expansion into Boston===\n[[File:NYCRR Headlights Cover 196502XX.png|thumb|right|An aerial photograph of the Boston Extension in the [[New York Central Railroad]] employee magazine ''Headlights'', February 1965]]\n\nEarly considerations for the [[Interstate Highway System]] included routing the transcontinental [[Interstate 90]] along [[Massachusetts Route 2|Route 2]] within Massachusetts, although this alignment in the northern part of the state was too costly. Ultimately, the turnpike in the southern part of the state was approved for Interstate designation, and became concurrent with I-90 in 1959. The [[New York State Thruway#Berkshire Connector|Berkshire Connector]] opened on May 26, 1959, connecting the west end to the [[New York State Thruway]] mainline south of [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. Prior to its opening, traffic used [[New York State Route 22|NY Route 22]] and [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|US&nbsp;20]]. At the Massachusetts/New York state line, one can see where the Turnpike made an abrupt right turn before terminating at Route 102 before the late-May 1959 connection into New York State, as the old pavement still exists for Turnpike Authority and State Police vehicles to access this remote stretch of highway.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=42.347834,-73.41181&sll=42.348427,-73.416138&sspn=0.00915,0.027852&ie=UTF8&t=h&ll=42.348284,-73.41176&spn=0.00915,0.019677&z=18 |title = View }}</ref>\n\nAfter political and legal battles related to the Boston Extension inside Route 128, construction began on March 5, 1962, with the chosen alignment running next to the [[Boston and Albany Railroad]] and reducing that line from four to two tracks.

Part of this was the elimination of the Turnpike Authority. Romney wanted to fold the Turnpike into MassHighway, the state highway department, operated under the Executive Office of Transportation. A first step to this was to replace the Chairman of the Board, [[Matthew J. Amorello]] with someone loyal to the Governor. The Governor has the power to appoint members to the board, but the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] (SJC) advised in an [[advisory opinion]] that \"nothing in G.

The two tracks [[segue]] into each other. Beyonc\u00e9 showcases her vocals over continuous organ chords and cymbals in the track. Whilst the previous interlude focused on intentionally placed themes of royal succession as well as the ecological and ultimately existential \u201cCircle of Life,\" Bigger shows Beyonc\u00e9 empowering the listener and actively encouraging them to act upon their ancestral history (\u201cI\u2019ll be the roots, you be the tree / Pass on the fruit that was given to me / Legacy, we\u2019re part of something way bigger.\u201d)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/07/beyonces-lion-king-album-gift-tells-deep-story/594640/|title=Beyonc\u00e9 Remixed the Meaning of The Lion King|date=July 26, 2019|publisher=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=April 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe themes running through the song likely transcend a simple narrative theme correlating to the film, however. Beyonc\u00e9 signifies that one must recognise their insignificance in the face of a bigger issue (\"If you feel insignificant / You better think again,\" \"You're part of something way bigger / Bigger than you, bigger than me\"). The meaning of this song can be traced back to [[African diaspora]], and consequentially [[institutional racism]]. [[Black people]] are being represented and empowered. Beyonc\u00e9, as a black woman, recognises and understands this struggle. Lyrically, Beyonc\u00e9 touches upon the oppression of black people and their previous disadvantage compared to [[white people]] (\"Life is your birthright, they hid that in the fine print\"). Beyonc\u00e9 is showing that black life is, or was, hidden in the [[fine print]]. This is a metaphor representing compression or previous ignorance towards the importance of the lives of black people - fine print is less noticeable print, smaller than the more obvious larger print it accompanies. This systemic oppression of black people is further represented in the song - \"Bigger than the picture they framed us to see / Bigger than the picture they framed us to be.\" She, ultimately, is empowering those who are products and victims of a society rooted deep in racism (\"Step out your estimate / Step in your essence and know that you're excellent\") and giving them a message of hope - she pushes forward the idea that, if one can recognise their insignificance, they must also be able to also recognise their importance to move forward. Beyonc\u00e9 further uses spiritual references to emphasize this (\"Rise (Rise), the spirit is teachin'\", \"Understand that truth 'bout that question in your soul (Bigger)\", \"Rise, the spirit is teachin'.\")\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 also incorporates her personal life into the song, most notably her children (\"No matter how hard it gets / You got my blood in ya / And you're gonna rise\") but also links back to the themes of ancestry and succession (\"Legacy, oh, you're part of something way bigger\"). Beyonc\u00e9 also opens up about the struggles she faces daily (\"Let mama let you know (Let you know) / Mama's still tryin' / I can't get no days off,\") while also building on her relationship with [[Jay-Z]] (\"Tryin' to be a good wife / Still really hard, I can't lie / But I promised you I would fight, so I fight\"): although she is invested deeply in their marriage, she continues to face trial and tribulations within it as the years go by.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Beyonc\u00e9 songs}}\n{{The Lion King}}\n\n[[Category:2019 songs]]\n[[Category:Beyonc\u00e9 songs]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Beyonc\u00e9]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Stacy Barthe]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Raye (singer)]]\n[[Category:Song recordings produced by Beyonc\u00e9]]\n\n\n{{2010s-R&B-song-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox song\n| name       = Bigger\n| cover      =\n| alt        = \n| artist     = [[Beyonc\u00e9]]\n| type       = song\n| album      = [[The Lion King: The Gift]]\n| released   = July 19, 2019\n| format     =\n* [[Music download|Digital download]]\n* [[Streaming media|streaming]]\n| recorded   = \n| studio     = \n| genre      =\n*[[Afrobeats]]\n*[[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]\n| length     = {{duration|m=3|s=46}}\n| label        = \n* [[Parkwood Entertainment|Parkwood]]\n* [[Columbia Records|Columbia]]\n| writer     =\n* Beyonc\u00e9\n* Richard Lawson\n* Derek Dixie\n* [[Stacy Barthe]]\n* Akil King\n* [[Raye (singer)|RAYE]]\n| producer   =\n* Beyonc\u00e9\n* Derek Dixie\n}}\n\n\"'''Bigger'''\" (stylized in uppercase) is a song recorded by American singer [[Beyonc\u00e9]] from the 2019 album ''[[The Lion King: The Gift]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://listen.tidal.com/album/113655822|title=The Lion King: The Gift / Beyonc\u00e9|publisher=[[Tidal (service)|Tidal]]|accessdate=July 25, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.8o8wave.com/beyonce-the-lion-king-the-gift-album/|title=The Lion King: The Gift / Beyonc\u00e9|publisher=8o8wave|accessdate=July 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe song was penned at a writing camp at Beyonc\u00e9's studio and was created due to a bond with British singer-songwriter [[Raye (singer)|Raye]] and US songwriter [[Stacy Barthe]].

The two tracks [[segue]] into each other. Beyonc\u00e9 showcases her vocals over continuous organ chords and cymbals in the track. Whilst the previous interlude focused on intentionally placed themes of royal succession as well as the ecological and ultimately existential \u201cCircle of Life,\" Bigger shows Beyonc\u00e9 empowering the listener and actively encouraging them to act upon their ancestral history (\u201cI\u2019ll be the roots, you be the tree / Pass on the fruit that was given to me / Legacy, we\u2019re part of something way bigger.\u201d)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/07/beyonces-lion-king-album-gift-tells-deep-story/594640/|title=Beyonc\u00e9 Remixed the Meaning of The Lion King|date=July 26, 2019|publisher=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=April 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe themes running through the song likely transcend a simple narrative theme correlating to the film, however. Beyonc\u00e9 signifies that one must recognise their insignificance in the face of a bigger issue (\"If you feel insignificant / You better think again,\" \"You're part of something way bigger / Bigger than you, bigger than me\"). The meaning of this song can be traced back to [[African diaspora]], and consequentially [[institutional racism]]. [[Black people]] are being represented and empowered. Beyonc\u00e9, as a black woman, recognises and understands this struggle. Lyrically, Beyonc\u00e9 touches upon the oppression of black people and their previous disadvantage compared to [[white people]] (\"Life is your birthright, they hid that in the fine print\"). Beyonc\u00e9 is showing that black life is, or was, hidden in the [[fine print]]. This is a metaphor representing compression or previous ignorance towards the importance of the lives of black people - fine print is less noticeable print, smaller than the more obvious larger print it accompanies. This systemic oppression of black people is further represented in the song - \"Bigger than the picture they framed us to see / Bigger than the picture they framed us to be.\" She, ultimately, is empowering those who are products and victims of a society rooted deep in racism (\"Step out your estimate / Step in your essence and know that you're excellent\") and giving them a message of hope - she pushes forward the idea that, if one can recognise their insignificance, they must also be able to also recognise their importance to move forward. Beyonc\u00e9 further uses spiritual references to emphasize this (\"Rise (Rise), the spirit is teachin'\", \"Understand that truth 'bout that question in your soul (Bigger)\", \"Rise, the spirit is teachin'.\")\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 also incorporates her personal life into the song, most notably her children (\"No matter how hard it gets / You got my blood in ya / And you're gonna rise\") but also links back to the themes of ancestry and succession (\"Legacy, oh, you're part of something way bigger\"). Beyonc\u00e9 also opens up about the struggles she faces daily (\"Let mama let you know (Let you know) / Mama's still tryin' / I can't get no days off,\") while also building on her relationship with [[Jay-Z]] (\"Tryin' to be a good wife / Still really hard, I can't lie / But I promised you I would fight, so I fight\"): although she is invested deeply in their marriage, she continues to face trial and tribulations within it as the years go by.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Beyonc\u00e9 songs}}\n{{The Lion King}}\n\n[[Category:2019 songs]]\n[[Category:Beyonc\u00e9 songs]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Beyonc\u00e9]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Stacy Barthe]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Raye (singer)]]\n[[Category:Song recordings produced by Beyonc\u00e9]]\n\n\n{{2010s-R&B-song-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Timeheist", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigger_(Beyonc%C3%A9_song)"}
