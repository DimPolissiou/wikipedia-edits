The name refers to an event that occurred on  March 1, 1919, hence the movement's name, literally meaning \"Three-One Movement\" or \"March First Movement\" in [[Korean language|Korean]]. It is also sometimes referred to as the '''Man-se Demonstrations''' ({{korean|hangul=\ub9cc\uc138\uc6b4\ub3d9|hanja={{linktext|\u842c\u6b72|\u904b\u52d5}}|rr=Manse Undong}}).\n\n==Background==\nThe Samil Movement arose in reaction to the repressive nature of colonial occupation under the [[de facto]] military rule of the Japanese Empire following 1905, and inspired by the \"[[Fourteen Points]]\" outlining the right of national \"[[self-determination]]\", which was proclaimed by President [[Woodrow Wilson]] at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in January 1918. After hearing news of Wilson's speech, Korean students studying in [[Tokyo]] published a statement demanding freedom from colonial rule.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/679025?needAccess=true|title=\"Awakening Asia\": Korean Student Activists in Japan, The Asia Kunglun, and Asian Solidarity, 1910\u20131923\n|first1=Dolf-Alexander|last1=Neuhaus|journal=Cross-Currents: East Asian History and Culture Review|volume=6|issue=2|pages=608\u2013638|doi=10.1353/ach.2017.0021}}</ref>\n\nFormer [[Gojong of Korea|Emperor Gojong]] died on January 21, 1919.

The activists initially planned to assemble at [[Tapgol Park]] in downtown Seoul, but chose a more private location out of fear that the gathering might turn into a riot. The leaders of the movement signed the document and sent a copy to the [[Governor-General of Korea|Governor General]].\n\n{{quote|We herewith proclaim the independence of Korea and the liberty of the Korean people. This we proclaim to all the nations of the world in witness of human equality. This we proclaim to our descendants so that they may enjoy in perpetuity their inherent right to nationhood.\n\nIn as much as this proclamation originates from our five-thousand-year history, in as much as it springs from the loyalty of twenty million people, in as much as it affirms our yearning for the advancement of everlasting liberty, in as much as it expresses our desire to take part in the global reform rooted in human conscience, it is the solemn will of heaven, the great tide of our age, and a just act necessary for the co-existence of all humankind. Therefore, no power in this world can obstruct or suppress it!}}\n\nThe movement leaders telephoned the central police station to inform them of their actions and were publicly arrested afterwards.\n\nBefore the formal declaration, Korea also published and broadcast the following complaints, in order to be heard by the Japanese people through papers and media:\n\n* Discrimination by the government when employing Koreans versus Japanese people; they claimed that no Koreans held important positions in the government.\n* A disparity in the quality of education being offered to Korean and Japanese people.\n* Mistreatment and open disregard of Koreans by the Japanese occupiers. \n* Political officials, both Korean and Japanese, were arrogant.\n* No special treatment for the Korean upper class or scholars.\n* The administrative processes were too complicated and new laws were passed too frequently for the general public to follow.\n* Too much forced labor that was not desired by the public.\n* Taxes were too heavy and the Korean people were paying more than before, while getting the same amount of services.\n* Land continued to be confiscated by the Japanese people for personal reasons.\n* Korean village teachers were being forced out of their jobs because the Japanese were trying to suppress Korean culture and teachings.\n* Korea's resources and labor had been exploited for the benefit for the Japanese. They argued that while Koreans were working towards development, they did not reap the benefits of their own work.\n\nThese grievances were highly influenced by Wilson's declaration of the principle of self determination as outlined in his \"[[Fourteen Points]]\" speech.<ref>{{cite book | editor = Eugene Kim | year = 1977 | title = Korea's Response to Japan | publisher = Western Michigan University | pages = 263\u2013266}}</ref>\n\nMassive crowds assembled in Pagoda Park to hear a student, Chung Jae-yong, read the declaration publicly. Afterwards, the gathering formed into a peaceable procession, which the Japanese military police attempted to suppress. Special delegates associated with the movement also read copies of the independence proclamation from appointed places throughout the country at 2 p.m. on that same day.\n\nAs the processions continued to grow, the Japanese local and military police could not control the crowds. The panicked Japanese officials called in military forces to quell the crowds, including the naval forces. As the public protests continued to grow, the suppression turned to violence, resulting in Japanese massacres of Koreans and other atrocities.\n\nApproximately 2,000,000 Koreans had participated in the more than 1,500 demonstrations. Several thousand were massacred by the Japanese police force and army.<ref name=\"britannica.com\">[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9050797?query=March%20First%20Movement&ct= March First Movement - Britannica Online Encyclopedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The frequently cited ''The Bloody History of the Korean Independence Movement'' ({{korean|hangul=\ud55c\uad6d\ub3c5\ub9bd\uc6b4\ub3d9\uc9c0\ud608\uc0ac|hanja=\u97d3\u570b\u7368\u7acb\u904b\u52d5\u4e4b\u8840\u53f2}}) by [[Park Eun-sik]] reported 7,509 people killed, 15,849 wounded, and 46,303 arrested.

Given the ensuing suppression and hunting down of activists by the Japanese, many Korean leaders went into exile in Manchuria, Shanghai and other parts of China, where they continued their activities.  The Movement was a catalyst for the establishment of the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea]] in [[Shanghai]] in April 1919.

During this period, there was a mobilization of Catholic and Protestant activists in Korea, with activism encouraged among the diaspora in the U.S., China, and Russia.\n\nThe Japanese government reacted to the March 1st Movement by heightening its suppression of dissent and dismissing the Movement as the \"Chosun Manse Violent Public Disorder Incident\" (\uc870\uc120 \uacf5\uacf5 \ub9cc\uc138 \ud3ed\ub825 \uc0ac\uac74).  [[Governor-General of Korea|Governor-General]] [[Hasegawa Yoshimichi]] accepted responsibility for the loss of control (although most of the repressive measures leading to the uprising had been put into place by his predecessors); he was replaced by [[Saito Makoto]]. The military police were replaced by a civilian force. Limited press freedom was permitted under what was termed the 'cultural policy'. Many of these lenient policies were reversed during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and [[World War II]].\n\nOn May 24, 1949, [[South Korea]] designated March 1st as a [[Public holidays in South Korea|national holiday]].  [[Choi Hong Hi|General Choe Hong-hui]] dedicated the first of the three patterns ([[Hyeong#Sam-Il|\uc0bc\uc77c \ud2c0 \u2013 Sam-il teul]]) trained by III-degree black belts of [[Taekwondo|taekwon-do]] to the Sam-il Movement.\n\n==International reaction==\n\n===United States and Korea===\n[[Woodrow Wilson|President Woodrow Wilson]] issued his [[Fourteen Points]] in January 1918.

Included in this delegation, was [[Kim Kyu-sik]] (\uae40\uaddc\uc2dd), a representative from the [[Korean Provisional Government]] in Shanghai.<ref name=\"Hart-Landsberg, Martin 1998 P. 30\"/> After considerable effort, he managed to arrange passage with members of the Chinese delegation to the peace conference. He traveled on a Chinese passport and under a Chinese name in order to evade the Japanese police. The Chinese were eager for the opportunity to embarrass Japan at the international forum, and several top Chinese leaders at the time, including [[Sun Yat-sen]], told U.S. diplomats that the peace conference should take up the question of Korean independence. Beyond that, however, the Chinese, locked in a struggle themselves against the Japanese, could do little for Korea.<ref>Manela, Erez (2007). ''The Wilsonian Moment''. Oxford.

The name refers to an event that occurred on  March 1, 1919, hence the movement's name, literally meaning \"Three-One Movement\" or \"March First Movement\" in [[Korean language|Korean]]. It is also sometimes referred to as the '''Man-se Demonstrations''' ({{korean|hangul=\ub9cc\uc138\uc6b4\ub3d9|hanja={{linktext|\u842c\u6b72|\u904b\u52d5}}|rr=Manse Undong}}).\n\n==Background==\nThe Samil Movement arose in reaction to the repressive nature of colonial occupation under the [[de facto]] military rule of the Japanese Empire following 1905, and inspired by the \"[[Fourteen Points]]\" outlining the right of national \"[[self-determination]]\", which was proclaimed by President [[Woodrow Wilson]] at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in January 1918. After hearing news of Wilson's speech, Korean students studying in [[Tokyo]] published a statement demanding freedom from colonial rule.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/679025?needAccess=true|title=\"Awakening Asia\": Korean Student Activists in Japan, The Asia Kunglun, and Asian Solidarity, 1910\u20131923\n|first1=Dolf-Alexander|last1=Neuhaus|journal=Cross-Currents: East Asian History and Culture Review|volume=6|issue=2|pages=608\u2013638|doi=10.1353/ach.2017.0021}}</ref>\n\nFormer [[Gojong of Korea|Emperor Gojong]] died on January 21, 1919.

The activists initially planned to assemble at [[Tapgol Park]] in downtown Seoul, but chose a more private location out of fear that the gathering might turn into a riot. The leaders of the movement signed the document and sent a copy to the [[Governor-General of Korea|Governor General]].\n\n{{quote|We herewith proclaim the independence of Korea and the liberty of the Korean people. This we proclaim to all the nations of the world in witness of human equality. This we proclaim to our descendants so that they may enjoy in perpetuity their inherent right to nationhood.\n\nIn as much as this proclamation originates from our five-thousand-year history, in as much as it springs from the loyalty of twenty million people, in as much as it affirms our yearning for the advancement of everlasting liberty, in as much as it expresses our desire to take part in the global reform rooted in human conscience, it is the solemn will of heaven, the great tide of our age, and a just act necessary for the co-existence of all humankind. Therefore, no power in this world can obstruct or suppress it!}}\n\nThe movement leaders telephoned the central police station to inform them of their actions and were publicly arrested afterwards.\n\nBefore the formal declaration, Korea also published and broadcast the following complaints, in order to be heard by the Japanese people through papers and media:\n\n* Discrimination by the government when employing Koreans versus Japanese people; they claimed that no Koreans held important positions in the government.\n* A disparity in the quality of education being offered to Korean and Japanese people.\n* Mistreatment and open disregard of Koreans by the Japanese occupiers. \n* Political officials, both Korean and Japanese, were arrogant.\n* No special treatment for the Korean upper class or scholars.\n* The administrative processes were too complicated and new laws were passed too frequently for the general public to follow.\n* Too much forced labor that was not desired by the public.\n* Taxes were too heavy and the Korean people were paying more than before, while getting the same amount of services.\n* Land continued to be confiscated by the Japanese people for personal reasons.\n* Korean village teachers were being forced out of their jobs because the Japanese were trying to suppress Korean culture and teachings.\n* Korea's resources and labor had been exploited for the benefit for the Japanese. They argued that while Koreans were working towards development, they did not reap the benefits of their own work.\n\nThese grievances were highly influenced by Wilson's declaration of the principle of self determination as outlined in his \"[[Fourteen Points]]\" speech.<ref>{{cite book | editor = Eugene Kim | year = 1977 | title = Korea's Response to Japan | publisher = Western Michigan University | pages = 263\u2013266}}</ref>\n\nMassive crowds assembled in Pagoda Park to hear a student, Chung Jae-yong, read the declaration publicly. Afterwards, the gathering formed into a peaceable procession, which the Japanese military police attempted to suppress. Special delegates associated with the movement also read copies of the independence proclamation from appointed places throughout the country at 2 p.m. on that same day.\n\nAs the processions continued to grow, the Japanese local and military police could not control the crowds. The panicked Japanese officials called in military forces to quell the crowds, including the naval forces. As the public protests continued to grow, the suppression turned to violence, resulting in Japanese massacres of Koreans and other atrocities.\n\nApproximately 2,000,000 Koreans had participated in the more than 1,500 demonstrations. Several thousand were massacred by the Japanese police force and army.<ref name=\"britannica.com\">[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9050797?query=March%20First%20Movement&ct= March First Movement - Britannica Online Encyclopedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The frequently cited ''The Bloody History of the Korean Independence Movement'' ({{korean|hangul=\ud55c\uad6d\ub3c5\ub9bd\uc6b4\ub3d9\uc9c0\ud608\uc0ac|hanja=\u97d3\u570b\u7368\u7acb\u904b\u52d5\u4e4b\u8840\u53f2}}) by [[Park Eun-sik]] reported 7,509 people killed, 15,849 wounded, and 46,303 arrested.

Given the ensuing suppression and hunting down of activists by the Japanese, many Korean leaders went into exile in Manchuria, Shanghai and other parts of China, where they continued their activities.  The Movement was a catalyst for the establishment of the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea]] in [[Shanghai]] in April 1919.

During this period, there was a mobilization of Catholic and Protestant activists in Korea, with activism encouraged among the diaspora in the U.S., China, and Russia.\n\nThe Japanese government reacted to the March 1st Movement by heightening its suppression of dissent and dismissing the Movement as the \"Chosun Manse Violent Public Disorder Incident\" (\uc870\uc120 \uacf5\uacf5 \ub9cc\uc138 \ud3ed\ub825 \uc0ac\uac74).  [[Governor-General of Korea|Governor-General]] [[Hasegawa Yoshimichi]] accepted responsibility for the loss of control (although most of the repressive measures leading to the uprising had been put into place by his predecessors); he was replaced by [[Saito Makoto]]. The military police were replaced by a civilian force. Limited press freedom was permitted under what was termed the 'cultural policy'. Many of these lenient policies were reversed during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and [[World War II]].\n\nOn May 24, 1949, [[South Korea]] designated March 1st as a [[Public holidays in South Korea|national holiday]].  [[Choi Hong Hi|General Choe Hong-hui]] dedicated the first of the three patterns ([[Hyeong#Sam-Il|\uc0bc\uc77c \ud2c0 \u2013 Sam-il teul]]) trained by III-degree black belts of [[Taekwondo|taekwon-do]] to the Sam-il Movement.\n\n==International reaction==\n\n===United States and Korea===\n[[Woodrow Wilson|President Woodrow Wilson]] issued his [[Fourteen Points]] in January 1918.

He traveled on a Chinese passport and under a Chinese name in order to evade the Japanese police. The Chinese were eager for the opportunity to embarrass Japan at the international forum, and several top Chinese leaders at the time, including [[Sun Yat-sen]], told U.S. diplomats that the peace conference should take up the question of Korean independence. Beyond that, however, the Chinese, locked in a struggle themselves against the Japanese, could do little for Korea.<ref>Manela, Erez (2007). ''The Wilsonian Moment''. Oxford.

His points total also enabled Austria to narrowly beat France in the men's nations cup by 201 points, the narrowest winning margin for many years.  Hirscher was the only Austrian male skier to win a race in the entire season, and scored 30.9% (1795 out of 5804) of the Austrian men's nations cup points.\n\nOn 13 November in [[Levi, Finland]], Hirscher won the first slalom of the [[2017 Alpine Skiing World Cup|2017]] season and equalled [[Pirmin Zurbriggen]]'s win total of 40, putting him equal 5th in the standings.

He made a last minute decision to race the slalom in [[Levi, Finland|Levi]] on 12 November and achieved a 17th-place finish.

Another GS win in [[Kranjska Gora, Slovenia]] confirmed Hirscher as the GS title winner with one race to go.  To wrap up an amazing season with 8 wins and 19 podiums Hirscher also won the men's overall World Cup title, his 5th consecutive overall title, a feat never before achieved by a male skier.  His points total also enabled Austria to narrowly beat France in the men's nations cup by 201 points, the narrowest winning margin for many years.  Hirscher was the only Austrian male skier to win a race in the entire season, and scored 30.9% (1795 out of 5804) of the Austrian men's nations cup points.\n\nOn 13 November in [[Levi, Finland]], Hirscher won the first slalom of the [[2017 Alpine Skiing World Cup|2017]] season and equalled [[Pirmin Zurbriggen]]'s win total of 40, putting him equal 5th in the standings.

Fortunately the first race of the season in [[S\u00f6lden]] was cancelled due to high winds, giving Hirscher a few more weeks to recover. He made a last minute decision to race the slalom in [[Levi, Finland|Levi]] on 12 November and achieved a 17th-place finish. The next technical race was the GS in [[Val-d'Is\u00e8re|Val d'Is\u00e8re]] on 9 December and Hirscher came 3rd. He won the slalom the next day.\n\nOn 17 December 2017 he won the giant slalom race in [[Alta Badia]], which was his fifth consecutive victory in that location, surpassing [[Ivica Kosteli\u0107]], who won the [[Hahnenkamm, Kitzb\u00fchel|Kitzb\u00fchel]] [[Alpine skiing combined|combined]] 4 times in a row.\n\nOn 4 January Hirscher achieved his 5th win of the season in the slalom in [[Zagreb]] and with it his 50th World Cup win, matching the total of legendary technical racer [[Alberto Tomba]]. Two days later Hirscher achieved his sixth win of the season by winning the GS in [[Adelboden]] and moved to 3rd overall in the men's World Cup winners rankings. The next day he won the slalom in [[Adelboden]]. On 23 January, with his 9th win of the season in the [[Planai|Schladming]] night slalom, Hirscher equalled his compatriot Austrian ski legend [[Hermann Maier]]'s 54 World Cup victories.  It was the 500th World Cup win for Austrian men.

The following day, Hirscher also won the slalom with a winning margin of 1.22 seconds.  As a result, he also won the slalom crystal globe for the 5th time, and the overall crystal globe for the seventh time in succession with 2 technical races remaining.  His Olympic gold medals plus the additional crystal globes enabled him to reach the top of the standings in the greatest alpine skiers of all time [[FIS Alpine Ski World Cup#Men's super ranking|men's super ranking]]. At the end of the slalom race, Hirscher said on Austrian television that he would go home \"and consider where the journey will go.

He then served in the [[U.S. Army]] in the European Theater, fighting in the [[Battle of the Bulge]] and became the Army's youngest [[master sergeant]] following his actions in the battle.  He graduated from [[Colgate University]] in 1948 where he was a member of [[Phi Kappa Tau]] fraternity.\n\n==Career==\nHe spent his entire career in the service of the North American college fraternity movement.  He served his own fraternity, [[Phi Kappa Tau]] in a number of positions culminating with his appointment as executive director.  In 1970, Anson became executive director of the [[North American Interfraternity Conference]], a position he held until his retirement in 1982.  His most significant achievement was his leadership in the effort to gain an exemption from Title IX to retain the single-sex character of American college [[fraternities]] and [[sororities]].  When Title IX was first passed, it looked as though student organizations such as fraternities and sororities would have to become co-educational.  With the help of Senator [[Birch Bayh]], a fraternity man and other friendly members of Congress, an exemption was gained that has not been in significant jeopardy of repeal since that time.\n\nHe was the author of ''The Golden Jubilee History of Phi Kappa Tau'' in 1957, ''A Diamond Jubilee History of the National Interfraternity Conference: 75 Glorious Years'' in 1984 and at the time of his death he was serving as editor of the current edition of ''[[Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities]]''.\n\n==Legacy and honors==\nIn 1985, Anson won the Interfraternity world's highest honor, the Gold Medal of the [[North American Interfraternity Conference]].  In addition, he was widely honored by men's and women's Greek-letter organizations for his contributions to the North American college fraternity movement including awards from [[Lambda Chi Alpha]], [[Delta Gamma]] and others.\n\nIn Anson's memory, the [[Association of Fraternity Advisors]] presents a Jack L.

A simple bimodal distribution, in this case a [[mixture distribution|mixture]] of two [[normal distribution]]s with the same variance but different means.  The figure shows the [[probability density function]] (p.d.f.), which is an equally-weighted average of the bell-shaped p.d.f.s of the two normal distributions.

A bimodal distribution.]]\n[[Image:Bimodal-bivariate-small.png|thumb|'''Figure 3.''' A bivariate, multimodal distribution]]\n\nIn [[statistics]], a '''bimodal distribution''' is a [[probability distribution]] with two different [[mode (statistics)|mode]]s.  These appear as distinct peaks (local maxima) in the [[probability density function]], as shown in Figures 1 and 2. Categorical, continuous, and discrete data can all form bimodal distributions.\n\nMore generally, a '''multimodal distribution''' is a probability distribution with two or more modes, as illustrated in Figure 3.\n\n==Terminology==\n\nWhen the two modes are unequal the larger mode is known as the major mode and the other as the minor mode. The least frequent value between the modes is known as the [[antimode]]. The difference between the major and minor modes is known as the [[amplitude]]. In time series the major mode is called the [[acrophase]] and the antimode the [[batiphase]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n==Galtung's classification==\n\nGaltung introduced a classification system (AJUS) for distributions:<ref name=Galtung1969>Galtung J (1969) Theory and methods of social research.

Others include the [[U-quadratic distribution]].\n\nThe ratio of two normal distributions is also bimodally distributed. Let\n\n: <math> R = \\frac{ a + x }{ b + y } </math>\n\nwhere ''a'' and ''b'' are constant and ''x'' and ''y'' are distributed as normal variables with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

In fishery science multimodal length distributions reflect the different year classes and can thus be used for age distribution- and growth estimates of the fish population.<ref>[http://www.fao.org/docrep/W5449E/w5449e05.htm.|FAO: Introduction to tropical fish stock assessment]</ref> Sediments are usually distributed in a bimodal fashion. Bimodal distributions are also seen in traffic analysis, where traffic peaks in during the AM rush hour and then again in the PM rush hour. This phenomenon is also seen in daily water distribution, as water demand, in the form of showers, cooking, and toilet use, generally peak in the morning and evening periods.\n\n===Econometrics===\n\nIn [[econometrics|econometric]] models, the parameters may be bimodally distributed.<ref name=Phillips2006>Phillips P C B (2006) A remark on bimodality and weak instrumentation in structural equation estimation.

In other words, the bimodally distributed random variable X is defined as <math> Y </math> with probability <math> \\alpha </math> or <math> Z </math> with probability <math> (1-\\alpha), </math> where ''Y'' and ''Z'' are unimodal random variables and <math>0 < \\alpha < 1</math> is a mixture coefficient.\n\nMixtures with two distinct components need not be bimodal and two component mixtures of unimodal component densities can have more than two modes. There is no immediate connection between the number of components in a mixture and the number of modes of the resulting density.\n\n===Particular distributions===\n\nBimodal distributions, despite their frequent occurrence in data sets, have only rarely been studied{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}.

The standard deviation is also larger than deviation of each normal distribution.\n\nAlthough several have been suggested, there is no presently generally agreed summary statistic (or set of statistics) to quantify the parameters of a general bimodal distribution.

The standard deviation is also larger than deviation of each normal distribution.\n\nAlthough several have been suggested, there is no presently generally agreed summary statistic (or set of statistics) to quantify the parameters of a general bimodal distribution.

MAPS was founded in 1986 by [[Rick Doblin]], and is now based in [[Santa Cruz, California]].\n\nMAPS helps scientists design, fund, and obtain regulatory approval for studies of the safety and effectiveness of a number of controlled substances. MAPS works closely with government regulatory authorities worldwide such as the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) to ensure that all of its sponsored research protocols conform to ethical and procedural guidelines for clinical drug research. Included in MAPS' research efforts are [[MDMA]] (methylenedioxymethamphetamine) for the treatment of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD); [[lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] and [[psilocybin]] for the treatment of [[anxiety]], [[cluster headaches]], and [[major depressive disorder|depression]] associated with end-of-life issues; [[ibogaine]] for the treatment of [[opiate]] [[Substance dependence|addiction]], [[ayahuasca]] for the treatment of drug addiction and PTSD; [[medical cannabis|medical marijuana]] for PTSD; and alternative delivery systems for [[medical cannabis|medical marijuana]] such as [[vaporizer (inhalation device)|vaporizer]]s and [[bong|water pipes]]. MAPS officials say the organization's ultimate goal is to establish a network of clinics where these and other treatments can be provided together with other therapies under the guidance of trained, licensed physicians and therapists.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Doblin R |title=A clinical plan for MDMA (\"Ecstasy\") in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD): partnering with the FDA |journal=Journal of Psychoactive Drugs |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=185\u201394 |year=2002 |pmid=12691208 |doi=10.1080/02791072.2002.10399952|citeseerx=10.1.1.545.1584 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring scientific research, MAPS organizes [[continuing medical education]] (CME) conferences, sponsors and presents lectures and seminars on the state of psychedelic and medical marijuana research, provides psychedelic harm reduction services through the Zendo Project at events such as music festivals and [[Burning Man]], and publishes a triannual magazine-style publication, the MAPS Bulletin, with updates about its ongoing research efforts, legal struggles, and educational initiatives.

Controlled research on human subjects began soon after and Hofmann's colleague Werner Stoll published his findings about the basic effects of LSD on human subjects in 1947.<ref name=\"Hofmann 2005\">{{Cite book|last = Hofmann|first = Albert|title=LSD: My Problem Child|year=2005|publisher=MAPS |location = Santa Cruz|isbn = 978-0-9660019-8-3}}</ref>\n\nAfter the earliest European and American research efforts investigated whether LSD could reliably induce psychotic disorders, some began to evaluate the potential for LSD to assist in traditional [[psychoanalysis|Freudian psychotherapy]] in the 1950s. Studies into the effects of LSD on human creativity and spirituality were also conducted during this period.\n\nOne notable researcher was [[Humphry Osmond]] whose team treated mental patients in the [[Weyburn Mental Hospital]] in [[Saskatchewan]] with psychedelics, which he thought gave insight into the way psychotic people see the world, but later realized they had a wider potential. In Weyburn, Osmond coined the term [[wikt:psychedelic|psychedelic]] meaning 'soul manifesting'. The first use of the word may have been in a poem Osmond wrote, which had the lines \u201cTo fathom Hell or go angelic / just take a pinch of psychedelic.\u201d.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325206188 |title=Psychedelic Prophets: The Letters of Aldous Huxley and Humphry Osmond &#124; Request PDF |publisher=Researchgate.net |date= |accessdate=2019-06-20}}</ref> The writer [[Aldous Huxley]] became interested in the Canadian research and Osmond subsequently gave Huxley a dose of [[mescaline]].<ref>Pollan, Michael 2018 How To Change Your Mind, Penguin Random House, {{ISBN|1594204225}}</ref> The resulting experience led Huxley to write ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'', stimulating widespread interest in psychedelics. (The rock band [[The Doors]] was named after the book and its titular quotation from [[William Blake]]). Osmond's work was followed by protocols for the use of psychedelics by mavericks like [[Alfred Matthew Hubbard|Al Hubbard]] who advocated the potential of LSD as a transcendental substance. Research in Saskatchewan, Toronto and elsewhere demonstrated impressive success in treating alcoholism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psychonautdocs.com/docs/dyck_hittinghighs.pdf |title=hkl039 313..329 |date= |accessdate=2019-06-20}}</ref>\n\nThe next major development in the history of psychedelic research was the rediscovery of psilocybin by Western society due to the appearance of an article in a 1957 issue of [[Life (magazine)|Life]] magazine written by [[R.

The first of these was the [[Concord Prison Experiment]] which began in 1961 under the supervision of principal researchers [[Timothy Leary]] and [[Ram Dass|Richard Alpert]]. The purpose of the experiment was to determine if psilocybin-assisted psychotherapeutic techniques could permanently reverse the criminal and anti-social tendencies of 32 state prisoners nearing parole and prevent them from being incarcerated again. Leary's team combined the administration of synthetic psilocybin in guided sessions with a variety of tests and support sessions during and after release.<ref>[http://jop.sagepub.com/content/28/1/62.abstract Hallucinogen use predicts reduced recidivism among substance-involved offenders under community corrections supervision] J Psychopharmacol January 2014 vol. 28 no. 1 62-66.</ref>\n\nThe next Harvard experiment with crucial implications for the development of psychedelic research was [[Walter Pahnke|Walter Pahnke's]] [[Good Friday Experiment]] of 1962. Pahnke set out to determine if psilocybin could be used to facilitate \"mystical\" experiences and if these experiences could cause permanent and beneficial personality transformation. In order to do so, he recruited 20 Protestant divinity students, 10 of whom would take synthetic psilocybin and 10 of whom would take a [[placebo]]. The experiment took place in a basement chapel in which the audio from a Good Friday service conducted in the main chapel upstairs was broadcast.\n\nThroughout the short history of LSD research, people unaffiliated or loosely affiliated with the scientific establishment distributed supplies of LSD outside of laboratory settings. Soon the lines between legitimate research and personal experimentation began to blur for some, and as early as 1962 fellow faculty members at Harvard openly criticized Leary and Alpert for abandoning scientific principles and experimenting with LSD outside official research settings. A few months later the university would dismiss both professors for violating university regulations by providing LSD to undergraduates. The controversy at Harvard coincided with greatly increased FDA restrictions on the procurement of LSD for scientific research; although some research did continue, most studies underway before the new FDA restrictions did not. After restricting its manufacture and distribution in 1965, the US government fully criminalized LSD in 1968, after which the European nations which hosted psychedelic research followed suit.<ref>{{cite book |last= Lattin |first= Don |year= 2010 |title= The Harvard Psychedelic Club: How Timothy Leary, Ram Dass, Huston Smith, and Andrew Weil Killed the Fifties and Ushered in a New Age for America |publisher= Harper Collins |isbn= 978-0-06-165593-7 |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/harvardpsychedel00latt }}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, legal psychedelic research was reduced to only one program \u2013 the studies conducted at the Spring Grove Center in Baltimore which primarily focused on end of life therapy and continued through to 1974. The study, which eventually came to be headed by Pahnke and [[Stanislav Grof|Grof]], resulted in the treatment of over 100 terminal patients, including 31 in a controlled LSD psychotherapy study.<ref>{{cite book |last= Grof |first= Stanislav |year= 1994 |title=LSD Psychotherapy: Exploring the Frontiers of the Hidden Mind |publisher=Hunter House |isbn=978-0-89793-166-3 }}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1980s, MDMA was administered in psychiatric and counseling settings, but recreational use also became increasingly widespread. MDMA research was mostly halted in 1985 by the United States government's initiation of proceedings to ensure temporary classification of the compound as a [[Controlled Substances Act|Schedule I]] drug (a classification made permanent in 1988). As psychedelics gained increasing recognition as potential psychotherapeutic agents, so too were they recognized within popular culture for their recreational use.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n=== Founding MAPS ===\n\nAnticipating that the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) would move to criminalize MDMA in light of the drug's increasing popularity in recreational use, Rick Doblin, Alise Agar and Debby Harlow organized a non-profit group called [[Earth Metabolic Design Laboratories]] (EMDL) to advocate for the potential therapeutic use of MDMA. By 1984 the DEA had announced its intention to designate MDMA as a Schedule I substance, a categorization that would greatly restrict and regulate the drug's availability, as well as indicate that it held no accepted medical use and a high abuse potential.<ref name=\"maps-dea-mdma\">{{citation|url=http://www.maps.org/dea-mdma/ |title=Documents from the DEA Scheduling Hearing of MDMA, 1984-1988 |publisher=Maps.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}</ref>\n\nEMDL organized supporters to petition the DEA for a scheduling hearing regarding MDMA. Dr. George Greer, [[Lester Grinspoon|Dr. Lester Grinspoon]], Professor James Bakalar, and Professor Thomas Roberts contributed to the argument that MDMA belonged in Schedule III, a category that would more readily enable future research and permit the continuation of its use in psychotherapy. Despite such efforts, the DEA pursued emergency scheduling in 1985, citing an imminent risk to public health.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nAs MDMA was now deemed illegal, held in the same category as such substances as heroin, the only way for it to be employed in scientific inquiry would be through the lengthy and expensive FDA approval process. Holding the belief that MDMA had the unique potential both to aid psychotherapy and eventually to become a prescription medicine, Rick Doblin sought to gain incorporation for MAPS as a 501(c)(3) non-profit research and educational organization. The founding of MAPS was a primary step toward the future envisioning of what Doblin has called a \"non-profit psychedelic-pharmaceutical company.\"<ref>{{cite news| title=This is your brain on drugs: Rick Doblin thinks pot, ecstasy, and other psychedelics could unlock the human mind \u2014 and he wants to bring them to Harvard, the FDA, and a doctor's office near you| author=Millard, M.| work=Boston Phoenix| date=October 8\u201314, 2004| url=http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/top/features/documents/04176022.asp| accessdate=31 May 2014| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131120004246/http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/top/features/documents/04176022.asp| archivedate=20 November 2013}}</ref> Chartered in 1986, MAPS has since contributed over 12 million dollars towards the scientific study of psychedelics and marijuana in therapeutic applications.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.maps.org/about/fiscal/ |title=Financial Reports |publisher=Maps.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=http://www.maps.org/about/mission/ |title=Mission |publisher=Maps.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}</ref>\n\n== Projects ==\n\nSince 1986, MAPS has distributed over $20 million to fund psychedelic and medical marijuana research and education.

Included in MAPS' research efforts are [[MDMA]] (methylenedioxymethamphetamine) for the treatment of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD); [[lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] and [[psilocybin]] for the treatment of [[anxiety]], [[cluster headaches]], and [[major depressive disorder|depression]] associated with end-of-life issues; [[ibogaine]] for the treatment of [[opiate]] [[Substance dependence|addiction]], [[ayahuasca]] for the treatment of drug addiction and PTSD; [[medical cannabis|medical marijuana]] for PTSD; and alternative delivery systems for [[medical cannabis|medical marijuana]] such as [[vaporizer (inhalation device)|vaporizer]]s and [[bong|water pipes]]. MAPS officials say the organization's ultimate goal is to establish a network of clinics where these and other treatments can be provided together with other therapies under the guidance of trained, licensed physicians and therapists.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Doblin R |title=A clinical plan for MDMA (\"Ecstasy\") in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD): partnering with the FDA |journal=Journal of Psychoactive Drugs |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=185\u201394 |year=2002 |pmid=12691208 |doi=10.1080/02791072.2002.10399952|citeseerx=10.1.1.545.1584 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring scientific research, MAPS organizes [[continuing medical education]] (CME) conferences, sponsors and presents lectures and seminars on the state of psychedelic and medical marijuana research, provides psychedelic harm reduction services through the Zendo Project at events such as music festivals and [[Burning Man]], and publishes a triannual magazine-style publication, the MAPS Bulletin, with updates about its ongoing research efforts, legal struggles, and educational initiatives.

Controlled research on human subjects began soon after and Hofmann's colleague Werner Stoll published his findings about the basic effects of LSD on human subjects in 1947.<ref name=\"Hofmann 2005\">{{Cite book|last = Hofmann|first = Albert|title=LSD: My Problem Child|year=2005|publisher=MAPS |location = Santa Cruz|isbn = 978-0-9660019-8-3}}</ref>\n\nAfter the earliest European and American research efforts investigated whether LSD could reliably induce psychotic disorders, some began to evaluate the potential for LSD to assist in traditional [[psychoanalysis|Freudian psychotherapy]] in the 1950s. Studies into the effects of LSD on human creativity and spirituality were also conducted during this period.\n\nOne notable researcher was [[Humphry Osmond]] whose team treated mental patients in the [[Weyburn Mental Hospital]] in [[Saskatchewan]] with psychedelics, which he thought gave insight into the way psychotic people see the world, but later realized they had a wider potential. In Weyburn, Osmond coined the term [[wikt:psychedelic|psychedelic]] meaning 'soul manifesting'. The first use of the word may have been in a poem Osmond wrote, which had the lines \u201cTo fathom Hell or go angelic / just take a pinch of psychedelic.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325206188 |title=Psychedelic Prophets: The Letters of Aldous Huxley and Humphry Osmond &#124; Request PDF |publisher=Researchgate.net |date= |accessdate=2019-06-20}}</ref>. The writer [[Aldous Huxley]] became interested in the Canadian research and Osmond subsequently gave Huxley a dose of [[mescaline]].<ref>Pollan, Michael 2018 How To Change Your Mind, Penguin Random House, {{ISBN|1594204225}}</ref> The resulting experience led Huxley to write ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'', stimulating widespread interest in psychedelics. (The rock band [[The Doors]] was named after the book and its titular quotation from [[William Blake]]). Osmond's work was followed by protocols for the use of psychedelics by mavericks like [[Alfred Matthew Hubbard|Al Hubbard]] who advocated the potential of LSD as a transcendental substance. Research in Saskatchewan, Toronto and elsewhere demonstrated impressive success in treating alcoholism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psychonautdocs.com/docs/dyck_hittinghighs.pdf |title=hkl039 313..329 |date= |accessdate=2019-06-20}}</ref>\n\nThe next major development in the history of psychedelic research was the rediscovery of psilocybin by Western society due to the appearance of an article in a 1957 issue of [[Life (magazine)|Life]] magazine written by [[R. Gordon Wasson]] detailing his experiences ingesting psilocybin mushrooms in a shamanic ceremony in Mexico.<ref>{{citation|author=R.

An article by Pichot about the basic effects of psilocybin on 137 normal and unhealthy subjects appeared in the medical journal Lancet in the same year.<ref name=\"Springer-1114889\">{{cite journal |date=February 25, 1961 |issn=0140-6736|oclc=01755507 |journal=[[The Lancet]] |volume=277 |issue=7174 |pages=444\u2013445 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(61)90023-X|title=Hallucinogenic Drugs }}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1960s, [[Harvard University]] was the seat of two experiments involving psilocybin. The first of these was the [[Concord Prison Experiment]] which began in 1961 under the supervision of principal researchers [[Timothy Leary]] and [[Ram Dass|Richard Alpert]]. The purpose of the experiment was to determine if psilocybin-assisted psychotherapeutic techniques could permanently reverse the criminal and anti-social tendencies of 32 state prisoners nearing parole and prevent them from being incarcerated again. Leary's team combined the administration of synthetic psilocybin in guided sessions with a variety of tests and support sessions during and after release.<ref>[http://jop.sagepub.com/content/28/1/62.abstract Hallucinogen use predicts reduced recidivism among substance-involved offenders under community corrections supervision] J Psychopharmacol January 2014 vol. 28 no. 1 62-66.</ref>\n\nThe next Harvard experiment with crucial implications for the development of psychedelic research was [[Walter Pahnke|Walter Pahnke's]] [[Good Friday Experiment]] of 1962. Pahnke set out to determine if psilocybin could be used to facilitate \"mystical\" experiences and if these experiences could cause permanent and beneficial personality transformation. In order to do so, he recruited 20 Protestant divinity students, 10 of whom would take synthetic psilocybin and 10 of whom would take a [[placebo]]. The experiment took place in a basement chapel in which the audio from a Good Friday service conducted in the main chapel upstairs was broadcast.\n\nThroughout the short history of LSD research, people unaffiliated or loosely affiliated with the scientific establishment distributed supplies of LSD outside of laboratory settings. Soon the lines between legitimate research and personal experimentation began to blur for some, and as early as 1962 fellow faculty members at Harvard openly criticized Leary and Alpert for abandoning scientific principles and experimenting with LSD outside official research settings. A few months later the university would dismiss both professors for violating university regulations by providing LSD to undergraduates. The controversy at Harvard coincided with greatly increased FDA restrictions on the procurement of LSD for scientific research; although some research did continue, most studies underway before the new FDA restrictions did not. After restricting its manufacture and distribution in 1965, the US government fully criminalized LSD in 1968, after which the European nations which hosted psychedelic research followed suit.<ref>{{cite book |last= Lattin |first= Don |year= 2010 |title= The Harvard Psychedelic Club: How Timothy Leary, Ram Dass, Huston Smith, and Andrew Weil Killed the Fifties and Ushered in a New Age for America |publisher= Harper Collins |isbn= 978-0-06-165593-7 |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/harvardpsychedel00latt }}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, legal psychedelic research was reduced to only one program \u2013 the studies conducted at the Spring Grove Center in Baltimore which primarily focused on end of life therapy and continued through to 1974. The study, which eventually came to be headed by Pahnke and [[Stanislav Grof|Grof]], resulted in the treatment of over 100 terminal patients, including 31 in a controlled LSD psychotherapy study.<ref>{{cite book |last= Grof |first= Stanislav |year= 1994 |title=LSD Psychotherapy: Exploring the Frontiers of the Hidden Mind |publisher=Hunter House |isbn=978-0-89793-166-3 }}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1980s, MDMA was administered in psychiatric and counseling settings, but recreational use also became increasingly widespread. MDMA research was mostly halted in 1985 by the United States government's initiation of proceedings to ensure temporary classification of the compound as a [[Controlled Substances Act|Schedule I]] drug (a classification made permanent in 1988). As psychedelics gained increasing recognition as potential psychotherapeutic agents, so too were they recognized within popular culture for their recreational use.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n=== Founding MAPS ===\n\nAnticipating that the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) would move to criminalize MDMA in light of the drug's increasing popularity in recreational use, Rick Doblin, Alise Agar and Debby Harlow organized a non-profit group called [[Earth Metabolic Design Laboratories]] (EMDL) to advocate for the potential therapeutic use of MDMA. By 1984 the DEA had announced its intention to designate MDMA as a Schedule I substance, a categorization that would greatly restrict and regulate the drug's availability, as well as indicate that it held no accepted medical use and a high abuse potential.<ref name=\"maps-dea-mdma\">{{citation|url=http://www.maps.org/dea-mdma/ |title=Documents from the DEA Scheduling Hearing of MDMA, 1984-1988 |publisher=Maps.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}</ref>\n\nEMDL organized supporters to petition the DEA for a scheduling hearing regarding MDMA. Dr. George Greer, [[Lester Grinspoon|Dr. Lester Grinspoon]], Professor James Bakalar, and Professor Thomas Roberts contributed to the argument that MDMA belonged in Schedule III, a category that would more readily enable future research and permit the continuation of its use in psychotherapy. Despite such efforts, the DEA pursued emergency scheduling in 1985, citing an imminent risk to public health.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nAs MDMA was now deemed illegal, held in the same category as such substances as heroin, the only way for it to be employed in scientific inquiry would be through the lengthy and expensive FDA approval process. Holding the belief that MDMA had the unique potential both to aid psychotherapy and eventually to become a prescription medicine, Rick Doblin sought to gain incorporation for MAPS as a 501(c)(3) non-profit research and educational organization. The founding of MAPS was a primary step toward the future envisioning of what Doblin has called a \"non-profit psychedelic-pharmaceutical company.\"<ref>{{cite news| title=This is your brain on drugs: Rick Doblin thinks pot, ecstasy, and other psychedelics could unlock the human mind \u2014 and he wants to bring them to Harvard, the FDA, and a doctor's office near you| author=Millard, M.| work=Boston Phoenix| date=October 8\u201314, 2004| url=http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/top/features/documents/04176022.asp| accessdate=31 May 2014| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131120004246/http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/top/features/documents/04176022.asp| archivedate=20 November 2013}}</ref> Chartered in 1986, MAPS has since contributed over 12 million dollars towards the scientific study of psychedelics and marijuana in therapeutic applications.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.maps.org/about/fiscal/ |title=Financial Reports |publisher=Maps.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=http://www.maps.org/about/mission/ |title=Mission |publisher=Maps.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}</ref>\n\n== Projects ==\n\nSince 1986, MAPS has distributed over $20 million to fund psychedelic and medical marijuana research and education.

MAPS has also been trying without success for almost four years to purchase 10 grams of marijuana from NIDA for research into the constituents of the vapor from marijuana vaporizers, a non-smoking drug delivery method that has already been used in one FDA-approved human study.|<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.maps.org/news-letters/v16n3-html/marijuana_production_facility.html |title=MAPS Bulletin Volume XVI Number 3: Winter 2006-7 |publisher=Maps.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}</ref>}}\n\nNIDA administers a contract with the University of Mississippi to grow the nation's only legal cannabis crop for medical and research purposes,<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web |url=http://archives.drugabuse.gov/about/organization/nacda/MarijuanaStatement.html |title=NIDA - About NIDA - Organization - NACDA - Provision of Marijuana and Other Compounds For Scientific Research - Recommendations of The National Institute on Drug Abuse National Advisory Council |work=archives.drugabuse.gov |date=January 1998 |accessdate=April 11, 2014 |author=Department of Health and Human Services |author2=National Institutes of Health |author3=National Institute on Drug Abuse |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412063112/http://archives.drugabuse.gov/about/organization/nacda/MarijuanaStatement.html |archivedate=April 12, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> including the [[Compassionate Investigational New Drug program]].  United States federal law registers cannabis as a Schedule I drug. Medical marijuana researchers typically prefer to use high-potency marijuana, but NIDA's National Advisory Council on Drug Abuse has been reluctant to provide cannabis with high THC levels, citing safety concerns:<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n{{quote|Most clinical studies have been conducted using cannabis cigarettes with a potency of 2-4% THC. However, it is anticipated that there will be requests for cannabis cigarettes with a higher potency or with other mixes of cannabinoids. For example, NIDA has received a request for cigarettes with an 8% potency. The subcommittee notes that very little is known about the clinical pharmacology of this higher potency. Thus, while NIDA research has provided a large body of literature related to the clinical pharmacology of cannabis, research is still needed to establish the safety of new dosage forms and new formulations. In the most recent rejection of [[medical marijuana]] by the Federal Government, the DEA denied [[Lyle Craker|Professor Craker]], [[Valerie Corral]], and MAPS request to end the federal governments monopoly on medical marijuana production and\nresearch.|<ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2006/05/28/weed_control/ Weed Control] Boston Globe May 28, 2006.

The DEA in response overturned the recommended ruling in January 2009, and later denied Craker's Motion to Reconsider in December 2010. In March 2011, Craker's lawyers submitted their final brief in the case.

Parkes in 1980, and ''A. r. rufogularis'', recognised by John Gould in 1838.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hbw.com/species/spiny-cheeked-honeyeater-acanthagenys-rufogularis|title=Spiny-cheeked Honeyeater (Acanthagenys rufogularis)|website=www.hbw.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-09}}</ref>\n\n== Breeding ==\n\nBreeding has been recorded in all months, and eggs have been found from June through to March; however, 75% of the eggs would be found between late August and mid-November in the eastern range of the bird.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThis is borne out by the observation of newly-hatched chicks being fed by the female bird with dark-coloured larvae of the scale insect around November and December.<ref name=\":4\" />  Later observations on the Mornington Peninsula, near Sorrento, saw fully-fledged chicks in late January being fed by the male bird on red berries, available in the region at that time of year.<ref name=\":4\" />  Both parents take a role in raising the young.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Pyke|first=Graham H.|date=1980|title=The foraging behaviour of Australian honeyeaters: a review and some comparisons with hummingbirds|doi=10.1111/j.1442-9993.1980.tb01258.x|journal=Australian Journal of Ecology|volume=5|issue=4|pages=343\u2013369}}</ref>\n\nThe nests are often found with two or three eggs during breeding.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=http://bie.ala.org.au/species/urn:lsid:biodiversity.org.au:afd.taxon:21267bfc-5c88-40fd-a239-f625d796f45b#gallery|title=Acanthagenys rufogularis  : Spiny-cheeked Honeyeater {{!}} Atlas of Living Australia|last=Australia|first=Atlas of Living|website=bie.ala.org.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-06-10}}</ref>  The eggs are an off-white colour with dark brown specks across the surface of the egg; however, most of the specks are towards one end of the egg.<ref name=\":9\" /> The nests are normally located from 1 meter to 13 meters from the ground, depending on the available opportunities to build a nest, and are suspended hammock-like between two branches. The nests are deep and cup-shaped, woven with grass, spider silk, and spider egg-sacs. Often the nest is lined with soft materials, like possum fur or [[Ptilotus|pussy tails]].<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Feeding adaptations ==\n\nThe spiny-cheeked honeyeater is an opportunist when it comes to feeding. Studies have shown that 38% of their diet is nectar; however, insects, small lizards, spiders, and larvae are also on the diet.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":6\" />\n\nThe spiny-cheeked honeyeater is one of the largest beaked among honeyeaters in a South Australian study, where it was found that this bird's preference for nectar and insects was about the same.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Ford|first=Hugh A.|date=1979|title=Interspecific competition in Australian honeyeaters depletion of common resources|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hugh_Ford/publication/229928450_Interspecific_competition_in_Australian_honeyeaters_-_Depletion_of_common_resources/links/0912f511eec3218f8b000000.pdf|journal=Australian Journal of Ecology|volume=4|pages=145\u2013164|via=Research Gate|doi=10.1111/j.1442-9993.1979.tb01205.x}}</ref>  However, when there is an abundance of nectar in the winter and spring, the birds tend to take advantage of this resource, allowing other times of the year for their diet on insects.<ref name=\":7\" />  The bird is considered a [[frugivorous]] feeder, so the remaining diet on fruit would be around 25%, if we consider that 38% of the diet is nectar.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nObservations of birds when feeding their fledglings in [[Sorrento, Victoria]], tell of birds taking advantage of available fruit from native plants.<ref name=\":4\" />  The birds have also been seen in orchard environments, but there is no conclusive evidence that this type of fruit was a target for their diet.<ref name=\"BIB\" />\n\n== Ecology ==\n\nThe ecology of the spiny-cheeked honeyeater would be similar to that of many honeyeaters.
