However, in 2010, Omegle introduced a video mode to complement the text chat mode, which pairs together strangers who are using webcams and microphones. The [[video chat]] also has a built in text window.\n\nIn 2011, the beta version of a new feature, \"Spy Mode\", was introduced. In Spy (Question) Mode, users have two options: to be the \"spy\" and ask a question of two strangers, or to discuss a question with another stranger. As the spy, the user inputs any question for the two strangers to answer or discuss and is able to view the discussion as a third party, albeit without being able to contribute further to the conversation. The spy can quit at any time without ending the chat for the two other strangers. If a user chooses to discuss a question instead, as in normal text mode, the user is paired with another stranger and can discuss the question the spy has asked up until the point the other stranger decides to disconnect and/or move on to another question.\n\nIn 2012, Omegle added a special new feature to the text and video modes, the option to input \"interest\" tags. Adding interests lets users be paired with a stranger who has something in common with the user. A user can input as many interests as he or she would like, and if no available match is found, the user is paired with a completely random stranger instead.\n\nIn 2013, an unmonitored version of the video chat mode was opened, leaving the original content moderator-regulated video section open to anyone aged thirteen and up as long as the content of his or her video stream is clean. Initially, questionable adult content in the video section of Omegle was filtered using [[image recognition]] algorithms only. The newer unmonitored video section allows consenting adults over the age of eighteen the freedom to view, and share with one another, uncensored explicit video streams.\n\nIn 2014, Omegle began experimenting with a \"[[Dormitory|Dorm]] Chat\" mode, which requires users to provide an [[email address]] ending in \"[[.edu]]\" to verify that they are associated with a [[college]] or [[university]]. Dorm Chat allows users to chat with their classmates and colleagues on Omegle.\n\nIn 2015, Omegle began implementing [[ReCAPTCHA|ReCaptcha]] security measures to help reduce the amount of [[Internet bot|bots]] on the site. This has, however, been met with complaints that bots remain and legitimate use is excessively interrupted.\n\nDuring late 2019 and early 2020, Omegle began throwing jabs at the [[Communist Party of China]], and expressing support for the [[2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests|Liberation of Hong Kong]] during the 2019/20 protests, with an image on the front page saying \"[[Xi Jinping]] ([[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]]) sure looks like [[Winnie-the-Pooh|Winnie the Pooh]].\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://z6mag.com/2019/10/10/omegle-throws-jabs-at-china-xi-pooh/|title=Omegle throws jabs at China: 'Xi = Pooh!'|last=Restar|first=Al|date=2019-10-10|website=Z6 Mag|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://funnyjunk.com/Omegle+is+supporting+hong+kong/giadMtv/|title=Omegle Is Supporting Hong Kong|website=funnyjunk.com|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\nPrior to early 2013, the site did not [[Censorship|censor]] contributions through a [[profanity filter]], and users have reported encountering [[nudity]] or [[sexual content]] on camera.<ref name=\"bbctech\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8539701.stm|title=Chatroulette and Omegle: chat rooms with a twist| publisher=BBC News |date=2010-03-24 |accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref> After January 2013, Omegle implemented a \"monitored\" video chat, to monitor misbehavior and protect people under the age of 18 from potentially harmful content, including nudity or sexual content.

The service randomly pairs users in one-on-one chat sessions where they chat anonymously using the names \"You\" and \"Stranger\" or \"Stranger 1\" and \"Stranger 2\" in the case of Spy mode. The site was created by 18-year-old Leif K-Brooks of [[Brattleboro, Vermont]], and was launched on March 25, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|last=Brooks |first=Leif |title=Welcome to the Omegle blog! |date=March 30, 2009 |url=http://omegler.blogspot.com/2009/03/welcome-to-omegle-blog.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403052716/http://omegler.blogspot.com/2009/03/welcome-to-omegle-blog.html |archive-date=April 3, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=\"thaindian\">{{cite web | title = Omegle chat program can help you find love anonymously | date = April 14, 2009| url = http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/health/omegle-chat-program-can-help-you-find-love-anonymously_100179374.html}}</ref> Less than a month after launch, Omegle garnered around 150,000 [[page views]] a day,<ref>{{cite news | last = Quenqua| first = Douglas | title = Tired of Old Web Friends?

However, in 2010, Omegle introduced a video mode to complement the text chat mode, which pairs together strangers who are using webcams and microphones. The [[video chat]] also has a built in text window.\n\nIn 2011, the beta version of a new feature, \"Spy Mode\", was introduced. In Spy (Question) Mode, users have two options: to be the \"spy\" and ask a question of two strangers, or to discuss a question with another stranger. As the spy, the user inputs any question for the two strangers to answer or discuss and is able to view the discussion as a third party, albeit without being able to contribute further to the conversation. The spy can quit at any time without ending the chat for the two other strangers. If a user chooses to discuss a question instead, as in normal text mode, the user is paired with another stranger and can discuss the question the spy has asked up until the point the other stranger decides to disconnect and/or move on to another question.\n\nIn 2012, Omegle added a special new feature to the text and video modes, the option to input \"interest\" tags. Adding interests lets users be paired with a stranger who has something in common with the user. A user can input as many interests as he or she would like, and if no available match is found, the user is paired with a completely random stranger instead.\n\nIn 2013, an unmonitored version of the video chat mode was opened, leaving the original content moderator-regulated video section open to anyone aged thirteen and up as long as the content of his or her video stream is clean. Initially, questionable adult content in the video section of Omegle was filtered using [[image recognition]] algorithms only. The newer unmonitored video section allows consenting adults over the age of eighteen the freedom to view, and share with one another, uncensored explicit video streams.\n\nIn 2014, Omegle began experimenting with a \"[[Dormitory|Dorm]] Chat\" mode, which requires users to provide an [[email address]] ending in \"[[.edu]]\" to verify that they are associated with a [[college]] or [[university]]. Dorm Chat allows users to chat with their classmates and colleagues on Omegle.\n\nIn 2015, Omegle began implementing [[ReCAPTCHA|ReCaptcha]] security measures to help reduce the amount of [[Internet bot|bots]] on the site. This has, however, been met with complaints that bots remain and legitimate use is excessively interrupted.\n\nDuring late 2019 and early 2020, Omegle began throwing jabs at the [[Communist Party of China]], and expressing support for the [[2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests|Liberation of Hong Kong]] during the 2019/20 protests, with an image on the front page saying \"[[Xi Jinping]] ([[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]]) sure looks like [[Winnie-the-Pooh|Winnie the Pooh]].\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://z6mag.com/2019/10/10/omegle-throws-jabs-at-china-xi-pooh/|title=Omegle throws jabs at China: 'Xi = Pooh!'|last=Restar|first=Al|date=2019-10-10|website=Z6 Mag|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://funnyjunk.com/Omegle+is+supporting+hong+kong/giadMtv/|title=Omegle Is Supporting Hong Kong|website=funnyjunk.com|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\nPrior to early 2013, the site did not [[Censorship|censor]] contributions through a [[profanity filter]], and users have reported encountering [[nudity]] or [[sexual content]] on camera.<ref name=\"bbctech\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8539701.stm|title=Chatroulette and Omegle: chat rooms with a twist| publisher=BBC News |date=2010-03-24 |accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref> After January 2013, Omegle implemented a \"monitored\" video chat, to monitor misbehavior and protect people under the age of 18 from potentially harmful content, including nudity or sexual content.
