It is surrounded by the [[Bangalore Rural]] district on the east and north, the [[Ramanagara district]] on the west and the [[Krishnagiri district]] of [[Tamil Nadu]] on the south. Bangalore Urban district came into being in 1986, with the partition of the erstwhile [[Bangalore]] into [[Bangalore]] Urban and [[Bangalore Rural district]]s. Bangalore Urban has five taluks:  Bangalore North (Bengaluru), Bangalore South ([[Kengeri]]), Bangalore East ([[Krishnarajapuram|Krishnaraja Pura]]), [[Yelahanka]] and [[Anekal]].  The city of [[Bangalore]] is situated in the Bangalore Urban district. The district has 17 [[hobli]]es, 668 villages and 9 [[municipal corporation]]s. There are five talukas; [[Electronics City]] is situated in Anekal Taluka.\n\nThe district had a population of 6,537,124 of which 88.11% is urban as of 2001.<ref>[http://www.censusindiamaps.net/page/India_WhizMap/IndiaMap.htm Census GIS India] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20120524115750/http://www.censusindiamaps.net/page/India_WhizMap/IndiaMap.htm |date=24 May 2012 }}</ref> As of Census 2011, its population has increased to 9,621,551, with a sex-ratio of 908 females/males, the lowest in the state and its density is 4,378 people per square km.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-04-06/bangalore/29387924_1_bangalore-today-population-dakshina-kannada | work=The Times of India | title=Girls are still scarce in IT City | date=6 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Climate===\nThe climate here is moderate.

Unlike the 201st decade (2001-2010), the term \"2000s (decade)\" is immune from the no year zero argument of its title in general (2000 was not part of the 1990s nor was 2010 included in the 2000s, but in the proceeding decade, the 2010s). If you wish to suggest otherwise or wish to discuss this matter, please refer to the article talk page. Thank You. -->  \n\nThe early part of the decade saw the long-time predicted breakthrough of economic giant [[Economy of China|China]], which had double-digit growth during nearly the whole decade. To a lesser extent, India also benefited from an economic boom, which saw the two most populous countries becoming an increasingly dominant economic force. The rapid catching-up of emerging economies with developed countries sparked some protectionist tensions during the period and was partly responsible for an increase in energy and food prices at the end of the decade. The economic developments in the latter third of the decade were dominated by a worldwide economic downturn, which started with the [[subprime mortgage crisis|crisis in housing and credit]] in the United States in late 2007 and led to the bankruptcy of major banks and other financial institutions. The outbreak of this [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|global financial crisis]] sparked a global recession, beginning in the United States and affecting most of the industrialized world.\n\nThe growth of the [[Internet]] contributed to [[globalization]] during the decade, which allowed faster communication among people around the world;<ref>Ludden D (1998).

The first social networking sites were [[Friendster]], [[Myspace]], [[Facebook]], and [[Twitter]] in 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2006, respectively. Myspace was the most popular social networking website until June 2009 when Facebook overtook Myspace in the number of American users. The E-mail continued to be popular throughout the decade and began to replace \"[[snail mail]]\" as the primary way of sending letters and other messages to people in far away locations, though it has been available since 1971.\n\nThe [[War on Terror]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]] began after the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001. The [[International Criminal Court]] was formed in 2002. A United States-led coalition invaded [[Iraq]], and the [[Iraq War]] led to the end of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s rule as Iraqi President and the [[Ba'ath Party]] in Iraq. [[Al-Qaeda]] and affiliated [[Islamism|Islamist]] militant groups performed terrorist acts throughout the decade. The [[Second Congo War]], the deadliest conflict since World War II, ended in July 2003. Further wars that ended included the [[Algerian Civil War]], the [[Angolan Civil War]], the [[Sierra Leone Civil War]], the [[Second Liberian Civil War]], the [[Nepalese Civil War]], and the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]]. Wars that began included the [[conflict in the Niger Delta]], the [[Houthi insurgency in Yemen]], and the [[Mexican Drug War]].\n\n[[Climate change]] and [[global warming]] became household words in the 2000s. Predictions tools made significant progress during the decade, UN-sponsored organizations such as the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] gained influence, and studies such as the [[Stern Review|Stern report]] influenced public support for paying the political and economic costs of countering climate change. The global temperature kept climbing during the decade. In December 2009, the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) announced that the 2000s may have been the warmest decade since records began in 1850, with four of the five warmest years since 1850 have occurred in this decade. The WMO's findings were later echoed by the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]].\n\nUsage of [[computer-generated imagery]] became more widespread in films during the 2000s. December 2009's ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' became the [[List of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film]] for nearly a decade, before being overtaken by ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' in 2019.

As a result of this growth, many of these developing countries accumulated [[capital (economics)|capital]] and started investing abroad. Other countries, including the [[United Arab Emirates]], Australia, Brazil and Russia, benefited from increased demand for their mineral and energy resources that global growth generated. The hollowing out of manufacturing was felt in Japan and parts of the United States and Europe which had not been able to develop successful innovative industries. Opponents point out that the practice of offshore outsourcing by countries with higher wages leads to the reduction of their own domestic employment and domestic investment. As a result, many customer service jobs as well as jobs in the information technology sectors ([[data processing]], [[computer programming]], and [[technical support]]) in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom have been or are potentially affected.\n\nWhile [[global trade]] rose in the decade (partially driven by China's entry into the [[WTO]] in 2001), there was little progress in the multilateral trading system. [[International trade]] continued to expand during the decade as emerging economies and developing countries, in particular China and South-Asian countries, benefited low wages costs and most often undervalued currencies.

Partially 3D and fully 2D games were still common in the industry early in the decade, but these have now become rare as developers look almost exclusively for fully 3D games to satisfy the increasing demand for them in the market. An exception to this trend is the indie gaming community, which often produces games featuring 'old-school' or retro gaming elements, such as [[Minecraft]] and [[Shadow Complex]]. These games, which are not developed by the industry giants, are often available in the form of downloadable content from services such as [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox Live]] or Apple's [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] and usually cost much less than more major releases.\n\n''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'' was released in Japan and later the United States, where it became immensely popular among teenagers.

Unlike the 201st decade (2001-2010), the term \"2000s (decade)\" is immune from the no year zero argument of its title in general (2000 was not part of the 1990s nor was 2010 included in the 2000s, but in the proceeding decade, the 2010s).

Thank You. -->  \n\nThe early part of the decade saw the long-time predicted breakthrough of economic giant [[Economy of China|China]], which had double-digit growth during nearly the whole decade. To a lesser extent, India also benefited from an economic boom, which saw the two most populous countries becoming an increasingly dominant economic force. The rapid catching-up of emerging economies with developed countries sparked some protectionist tensions during the period and was partly responsible for an increase in energy and food prices at the end of the decade. The economic developments in the latter third of the decade were dominated by a worldwide economic downturn, which started with the [[subprime mortgage crisis|crisis in housing and credit]] in the United States in late 2007 and led to the bankruptcy of major banks and other financial institutions. The outbreak of this [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|global financial crisis]] sparked a global recession, beginning in the United States and affecting most of the industrialized world.\n\nThe growth of the [[Internet]] contributed to [[globalization]] during the decade, which allowed faster communication among people around the world;<ref>Ludden D (1998).

The first social networking sites were [[Friendster]], [[Myspace]], [[Facebook]], and [[Twitter]] in 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2006, respectively. Myspace was the most popular social networking website until June 2009 when Facebook overtook Myspace in the number of American users. The E-mail continued to be popular throughout the decade and began to replace \"[[snail mail]]\" as the primary way of sending letters and other messages to people in far away locations, though it has been available since 1971.\n\nThe [[War on Terror]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]] began after the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001. The [[International Criminal Court]] was formed in 2002. A United States-led coalition invaded [[Iraq]], and the [[Iraq War]] led to the end of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s rule as Iraqi President and the [[Ba'ath Party]] in Iraq. [[Al-Qaeda]] and affiliated [[Islamism|Islamist]] militant groups performed terrorist acts throughout the decade. The [[Second Congo War]], the deadliest conflict since World War II, ended in July 2003. Further wars that ended included the [[Algerian Civil War]], the [[Angolan Civil War]], the [[Sierra Leone Civil War]], the [[Second Liberian Civil War]], the [[Nepalese Civil War]], and the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]]. Wars that began included the [[conflict in the Niger Delta]], the [[Houthi insurgency in Yemen]], and the [[Mexican Drug War]].\n\n[[Climate change]] and [[global warming]] became household words in the 2000s. Predictions tools made significant progress during the decade, UN-sponsored organizations such as the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] gained influence, and studies such as the [[Stern Review|Stern report]] influenced public support for paying the political and economic costs of countering climate change. The global temperature kept climbing during the decade. In December 2009, the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) announced that the 2000s may have been the warmest decade since records began in 1850, with four of the five warmest years since 1850 have occurred in this decade. The WMO's findings were later echoed by the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]].\n\nUsage of [[computer-generated imagery]] became more widespread in films during the 2000s. December 2009's ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' became the [[List of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film]] for nearly a decade, before being overtaken by ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' in 2019. Documentary and [[mockumentary]] films, such as ''[[March of the Penguins]]'' and ''[[Super Size Me]]'', were popular in the 2000s. 2004's ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'' by [[Michael Moore]] is the highest grossing documentary of all time. Online films became popular, and conversion to [[digital cinema]] started.  Video game consoles released in this decade included the [[PlayStation 2]], the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], the [[GameCube]], the [[Wii]], the [[PlayStation 3]] and the [[Xbox 360]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n=={{Anchor|name}}Name for the decade==\n{{See also|Aughts}}\nIn the English-speaking world, a name for the decade was never universally accepted in the same manner as for decades, such as the '80s and the '90s.<ref name=\"news.yahoo.com\">{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ynews_deca/ynews_deca_ts1010|first=Leah|last=Hitchings|title=Even with 10 years to decide, still no name for the decade|publisher=News.yahoo.com|date=December 8, 2000|accessdate=February 13, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117172425/https://news.yahoo.com/s/ynews_deca/ynews_deca_ts1010|archivedate=January 17, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Week-name\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theweek.com/article/index/103534/Why_cant_we_name_this_decade|title=Why can't we name this decade?|publisher=Theweek.com|date=November 30, 2009|accessdate=February 13, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215042846/http://theweek.com/article/index/103534/Why_cant_we_name_this_decade|archivedate=December 15, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC-name\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8436194.stm|work=BBC News| title=Decade dilemma|date=December 31, 2009|accessdate=April 21, 2010| first=Finlo| last=Rohrer|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214202127/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8436194.stm|archivedate=December 14, 2013}}</ref> Orthographically, the decade can be written as the \"2000s\" or the {{\" '}}00s\".

An enormous loss of life and property value came in 2005 when [[Hurricane Katrina]] flooded nearly the entire city of [[New Orleans]]. The resulting political fallout was severely damaging to the [[George W. Bush]] administration because of its perceived failure to act promptly and effectively.

The 6th gen remained popular throughout the decade, but decreased somewhat in popularity after its 7th gen successors released technically starting in November 2005 with the release of Microsoft's Xbox 360, however, most people agree that 2006 is a 6th gen year since most games being released still released on 6th gen including the Xbox even though the 360 was already released, and the PlayStation 3 and the Wii didn't release until late 2006 which most people consider to be the true start of the 7th gen. It reached [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|7th Generation]] in the form of [[video game console|consoles]] like the [[Wii]], the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] by the mid-2000s. The number-one-selling game console of the decade, the [[PlayStation 2]], was released in 2000 and remained popular up to the end of the decade, even after the [[PlayStation 3]] was released. The [[PlayStation 2]] was discontinued in January 2013. [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPGs]], originating in the mid-to-late 1990s, become a popular PC trend and virtual online worlds become a reality as games such as ''[[RuneScape]]'' (2001), ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'' (2002), ''[[Eve Online]]'' (2003), ''[[Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided]]'' (2003), ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' (2004), and ''[[Everquest II]]'' (2004), ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar]]'' (2007) and ''[[Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning]]'' (2008) are released. These worlds come complete with their own economies and social organization as directed by the players as a whole. The persistent online worlds allow the games to remain popular for many years. ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', premiered in 2004, remains one of the most popular games in PC gaming and is still being developed into the 2010s.\n\nThe ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' series sparked a fad of Mature-rated video games based on including gang warfare, drug use, and perceived \"senseless violence\" into gameplay. Though violent video games date back to the early 1990s, they became much more common after 2000. Despite the controversy, the 2004 game ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' became the best selling [[PlayStation 2]] game of all time, with 17.33 million copies sold for that console alone, from a total of 21.5 million in all formats by 2009;<ref name=\"guinness 2009\">{{cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2009 Gamer's Edition|pages=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_o9k7/page/108 108\u2013109]|isbn=1904994458|quote=''GTA: San Andreas'' is the best-selling PlayStation 2 game of all time, with a massive 17.33 million copies sold.|url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_o9k7/page/108}}</ref> as of 2011, 27.5 million copies of ''San Andreas'' were sold worldwide.<ref name=\"2011sales\">{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5840484/gta-iv-overtakes-san-andreas-in-lifetime-sales|title=GTA IV Overtakes San Andreas in Lifetime Sales [Correction]|publisher=Kotaku|first=Owen|last=Good|date=September 15, 2011|accessdate=September 12, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701162931/http://kotaku.com/5840484/gta-iv-overtakes-san-andreas-in-lifetime-sales|archivedate=July 1, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Call of Duty]] series was extremely popular during the 2000s, the diverse shooter franchise released multiple games throughout the 2000s that were positively critically reviewed and commercially successful.\n\n''[[Gears of War (series)|Gears of War]]'' was a critically acclaimed and commercially successful [[third-person shooter]] franchise that released two games during the mid-late 2000s. [[Gears of War|Gears of War 1]] was released in 2006 and was the first installment to the franchise, it was universally critically acclaimed and went on to sell over 5 million copies. The second installment to the franchise ''[[Gears of War 2]]'' was released in 2008 and received widespread critical acclaim and also went on to sell over 5 million copies.\n\nOctober 29, 2007 \u2013 ''[[Manhunt 2]]'' \u2013 a controversial stealth-based [[psychological horror]] [[video game]] published by [[Rockstar Games]] was suspended by [[Take-Two Interactive]] (Rockstar's parent company) when it was refused classification in the United Kingdom, Italy and Ireland, and given an Adults Only (AO) rating in the United States.

''[[Halo 2]]'' started [[online console gaming]] and was on top of the [[Xbox Live]] charts until its successor, ''[[Halo 3]]'' (for Xbox 360), took over. Some other popular first-person shooters during the 2000s include the [[Medal of Honor]] series, with ''[[Medal of Honor: Frontline]]''{{'}}s release in 2002 bringing the first game in the series to 6th generation consoles.\n\nIn the late 2000s, motion controlled video games grew in popularity, from the PlayStation 2's [[EyeToy]] to Nintendo's successful [[Wii]] console. During the decade 3D video games become the staple of the video-game industry, with 2D games nearly fading from the market. Partially 3D and fully 2D games were still common in the industry early in the decade, but these have now become rare as developers look almost exclusively for fully 3D games to satisfy the increasing demand for them in the market. An exception to this trend is the indie gaming community, which often produces games featuring 'old-school' or retro gaming elements, such as [[Minecraft]] and [[Shadow Complex]]. These games, which are not developed by the industry giants, are often available in the form of downloadable content from services such as [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox Live]] or Apple's [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] and usually cost much less than more major releases.\n\n''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'' was released in Japan and later the United States, where it became immensely popular among teenagers. Another music game, ''[[Guitar Hero]]'', was released in North America in 2005 and [[Cultural impact of the Guitar Hero series|had a huge cultural impact]] on both the music and video games industries. It became a worldwide billion-dollar franchise within three years, spawning several sequels and leading to the creation of a competing franchise, ''Rock Band''.\n\nJapanese media giant [[Nintendo]] released 9 out of the 10 top selling games of the 2000s, further establishing the company's dominance over the market.<ref>[http://top-10er.blogspot.com/2010/03/top-10-best-selling-video-games-2000.html Blogspot.com]\n\n[[Cartoon Network]] also released its \"biggest game ever\" on January 19, 2009, known as ''[[Cartoon Network Universe: FusionFall]]''.

It can handle graphics and standard features of [[programming language]]s such as <code>if</code> and <code>loop</code> commands. PDF is largely based on PostScript but simplified to remove flow control features like these, while graphics commands such as <code>lineto</code> remain.\n\nOften, the PostScript-like PDF code is generated from a source PostScript file. The graphics commands that are output by the PostScript code are collected and [[Lexical analysis|tokenized]]. Any files, graphics, or fonts to which the document refers also are collected. Then, everything is compressed to a single file. Therefore, the entire PostScript world (fonts, layout, measurements) remains intact.\n\nAs a document format, PDF has several advantages over PostScript:\n* PDF contains tokenized and interpreted results of the PostScript source code, for direct correspondence between changes to items in the PDF page description and changes to the resulting page appearance.\n* PDF (from version 1.4) supports [[transparency (graphic)|graphic transparency]]; PostScript does not.\n* PostScript is an [[interpreted programming language]] with an implicit global state, so instructions accompanying the description of one page can affect the appearance of any following page. Therefore, all preceding pages in a PostScript document must be processed to determine the correct appearance of a given page, whereas each page in a PDF document is unaffected by the others. As a result, PDF viewers allow the user to quickly jump to the final pages of a long document, whereas a PostScript viewer needs to process all pages sequentially before being able to display the destination page (unless the optional PostScript [[Document Structuring Conventions]] have been carefully complied and included).\n\n== Technical overview ==\n=== File structure ===\nA PDF file is a 7-bit [[ASCII]] file, except for certain elements that may have binary content.\nA PDF file starts with a header containing the [[File format#Magic number|magic number]] and the version of the format such as <code>%PDF-1.7</code>. The format is a subset of a COS (\"Carousel\" Object Structure) format.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://jimpravetz.com/blog/2012/12/in-defense-of-cos/ |title = In Defense of COS, or Why I Love JSON and Hate XML |first = Jim |last = Pravetz |website = jimpravetz.com }}</ref> A COS tree file consists primarily of ''objects'', of which there are eight types:<ref>Adobe Systems, PDF Reference, p.&nbsp;51.</ref>\n* [[Boolean data type|Boolean]] values, representing ''true'' or ''false''\n* Numbers\n* [[String (computer science)|Strings]], enclosed within parentheses (<code>(...)</code>), may contain 8-bit characters.\n* Names, starting with a forward slash (<code>/</code>)\n* [[Array data type|Arrays]], ordered collections of objects enclosed within square brackets (<code>[...]</code>)\n* [[Dictionary (data structure)|Dictionaries]], collections of objects indexed by Names enclosed within double pointy brackets (<code>&lt;&lt;...&gt;&gt;</code>)\n* [[Stream (computing)|Streams]], usually containing large amounts of data, which can be compressed and binary, between the <code>stream</code> and <code>endstream</code> keywords, preceded by a dictionary\n* The [[Pointer (computer programming)|null]] object\nFurthermore, there may be comments, introduced with the percent sign (<code>%</code>). Comments may contain 8-bit characters.\n\nObjects may be either ''direct'' (embedded in another object) or ''indirect''. Indirect objects are numbered with an ''object number'' and a ''generation number'' and defined between the <code>obj</code> and <code>endobj</code> keywords if residing in the document root. Beginning with PDF version 1.5, indirect objects (except other streams) may also be located in special streams known as ''object streams'' (marked <code>/Type /ObjStm</code>). This technique enables non-stream objects to have standard stream filters applied to them, reduces the size of files that have large numbers of small indirect objects and is especially useful for ''Tagged PDF''. Object streams do not support specifying an object's ''generation number'' (other than 0).\n\nAn index table, also called the cross-reference table, is typically located near the end of the file and gives the byte offset of each indirect object from the start of the file.<ref>Adobe Systems, PDF Reference, pp. 39\u201340.</ref> This design allows for efficient [[random access]] to the objects in the file, and also allows for small changes to be made without rewriting the entire file (''incremental update''). Before PDF version 1.5, the table would always be in a special ASCII format, be marked with the <code>xref</code> keyword, and follow the main body composed of indirect objects. Version 1.5 introduced optional ''cross-reference streams'', which have the form of a standard stream object, possibly with filters applied. Such a stream may be used instead of the ASCII cross-reference table and contains the offsets and other information in binary format. The format is flexible in that it allows for integer width specification (using the <code>/W</code> array), so that for example a document not exceeding 64&nbsp;[[KiB]] in size may dedicate only 2&nbsp;bytes for object offsets.\n\nAt the end of a PDF file is a footer containing:\n* The <code>startxref</code> keyword followed by an offset to the start of the cross-reference table (starting with the <code>xref</code> keyword) or the cross-reference stream object\n* And the <code>%%EOF</code> [[end-of-file]] marker.\n\nIf a cross-reference stream is not being used, the footer is preceded by the <code>trailer</code> keyword followed by a dictionary containing information that would otherwise be contained in the cross-reference stream object's dictionary:\n* A reference to the root object of the tree structure, also known as the ''catalog'' (<code>/Root</code>)\n* The count of indirect objects in the cross-reference table (<code>/Size</code>)\n* And other optional information.\n\nThere are two layouts to the PDF files: non-linear (not \"optimized\") and linear (\"optimized\"). Non-linear PDF files consume less disk space than their linear counterparts, though they are slower to access because portions of the data required to assemble pages of the document are scattered throughout the PDF file. Linear PDF files (also called \"optimized\" or \"web optimized\" PDF files) are constructed in a manner that enables them to be read in a Web browser plugin without waiting for the entire file to download, since they are written to disk in a linear (as in page order) fashion.<ref name=\"pdf-ref\">{{cite web |url=https://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference.html |title=Adobe Developer Connection: PDF Reference and Adobe Extensions to the PDF Specification |publisher=Adobe Systems |accessdate=2010-12-13}}</ref> PDF files may be optimized using [[Adobe Acrobat]] software or [[QPDF]].\n\n=== Imaging model ===\nThe basic design of how [[graphics]] are represented in PDF is very similar to that of PostScript, except for the use of [[transparency (graphic)|transparency]], which was added in PDF 1.4.\n\nPDF graphics use a [[device independence|device-independent]] [[Cartesian coordinate system]] to describe the surface of a page. A PDF page description can use a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] to [[scale (ratio)|scale]], [[rotate]], or [[Shear mapping|skew]] graphical elements. A key concept in PDF is that of the ''graphics state'', which is a collection of graphical parameters that may be changed, saved, and restored by a ''page description''. PDF has (as of version 1.6) 24 graphics state properties, of which some of the most important are:\n* The ''current transformation matrix'' (CTM), which determines the coordinate system\n* The ''[[clipping path]]''\n* The ''[[color space]]''\n* The ''[[alpha compositing|alpha constant]]'', which is a key component of transparency\n\n==== Vector graphics ====\nAs in PostScript, [[vector graphics]] in PDF are constructed with ''paths''. Paths are usually composed of lines and cubic [[B\u00e9zier curve]]s, but can also be constructed from the outlines of text. Unlike PostScript, PDF does not allow a single path to mix text outlines with lines and curves. Paths can be stroked, filled, [[clipping path|clipping]]. Strokes and fills can use any color set in the graphics state, including ''patterns''.\n\nPDF supports several types of patterns. The simplest is the ''tiling pattern'' in which a piece of artwork is specified to be drawn repeatedly. This may be a ''colored tiling pattern'', with the colors specified in the pattern object, or an ''uncolored tiling pattern'', which defers color specification to the time the pattern is drawn. Beginning with PDF 1.3 there is also a ''shading pattern'', which draws continuously varying colors. There are seven types of shading pattern of which the simplest are the ''axial shade'' (Type 2) and ''radial shade'' (Type 3). <!-- Pictures desperately needed here! -->\n\n==== Raster images ====\n[[Raster graphics|Raster images]] in PDF (called ''Image XObjects'') are represented by dictionaries with an associated stream. The dictionary describes properties of the image, and the stream contains the image data. (Less commonly, a raster image may be embedded directly in a page description as an ''inline image''.) Images are typically ''filtered'' for compression purposes. Image filters supported in PDF include the general purpose filters\n* '''ASCII85Decode''' a filter used to put the stream into 7-bit [[ASCII]]\n* '''ASCIIHexDecode''' similar to ASCII85Decode but less compact\n* '''FlateDecode''' a commonly used filter based on the [[deflate]] algorithm defined in {{IETF RFC|1951}} (deflate is also used in the [[gzip]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], and [[ZIP (file format)|zip]] file formats among others); introduced in PDF 1.2; it can use one of two groups of predictor functions for more compact zlib/deflate compression: ''Predictor 2'' from the [[TIFF]] 6.0 specification and predictors (filters) from the [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] specification ({{IETF RFC|2083}})\n* '''LZWDecode''' a filter based on [[LZW]] Compression; it can use one of two groups of predictor functions for more compact LZW compression: ''Predictor 2'' from the TIFF 6.0 specification and predictors (filters) from the PNG specification\n* '''RunLengthDecode''' a simple compression method for streams with repetitive data using the [[run-length encoding]] algorithm and the image-specific filters\n* '''DCTDecode''' a [[lossy]] filter based on the [[JPEG]] standard\n* '''CCITTFaxDecode''' a [[lossless]] [[bi-level image|bi-level]] (black/white) filter based on the Group 3 or [[Group 4 compression|Group 4]] [[CCITT]] (ITU-T) [[fax]] compression standard defined in ITU-T [[T.4]] and T.6\n* '''JBIG2Decode''' a lossy or lossless bi-level (black/white) filter based on the [[JBIG2]] standard, introduced in PDF 1.4\n* '''JPXDecode''' a lossy or lossless filter based on the [[JPEG 2000]] standard, introduced in PDF 1.5\n\nNormally all image content in a PDF is embedded in the file. But PDF allows image data to be stored in external files by the use of ''external streams'' or ''Alternate Images''. Standardized subsets of PDF, including [[PDF/A]] and [[PDF/X]], prohibit these features.\n\n==== Text ====\nText in PDF is represented by ''text elements'' in page content streams. A text element specifies that ''characters'' should be drawn at certain positions. The characters are specified using the ''encoding'' of a selected ''font resource''.\n\n===== Fonts =====\nA font object in PDF is a description of a digital [[typeface]]. It may either describe the characteristics of a typeface, or it may include an embedded ''font file''. The latter case is called an ''embedded font'' while the former is called an ''unembedded font''. The font files that may be embedded are based on widely used standard digital font formats: '''[[PostScript fonts|Type 1]]''' (and its compressed variant '''CFF'''), '''[[TrueType]]''', and (beginning with PDF 1.6) '''[[OpenType]]'''. Additionally PDF supports the '''Type 3''' variant in which the components of the font are described by PDF graphic operators. <!--- Type 3 bit is awkward and should be cleaned up --->\n\n===== Standard Type 1 Fonts (Standard 14 Fonts) =====\nFourteen typefaces, known as the ''standard 14 fonts'', have a special significance in PDF documents:\n* [[Times Roman|Times]] (v3) (in regular, italic, bold, and bold italic)\n* [[Courier (typeface)|Courier]] (in regular, oblique, bold and bold oblique)\n* [[Helvetica]] (v3) (in regular, oblique, bold and bold oblique)\n* [[Symbol (typeface)|Symbol]]\n* [[Zapf Dingbats]]\nThese fonts are sometimes called the ''base fourteen fonts''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://desktoppub.about.com/od/glossary/g/base14fonts.htm|title=Desktop Publishing: Base 14 Fonts \u2013 Definition|last=Howard|first=Jacci|work=About.com Tech|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160614134144/http://desktoppub.about.com/od/glossary/g/base14fonts.htm|archive-date=June 14, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> These fonts, or suitable substitute fonts with the same metrics, should be available in most PDF readers, but they are not ''guaranteed'' to be available in the reader, and may only display correctly if the system has them installed.<ref name=\"aquarium\">[http://www.planetpdf.com/planetpdf/pdfs/pdf2k/03e/merz_fontaquarium.pdf The PDF Font Aquarium]</ref> Fonts may be substituted if they are not embedded in a PDF.\n\n===== Encodings =====\nWithin text strings, characters are shown using ''character codes'' (integers) that map to glyphs in the current font using an ''encoding''. There are a number of predefined encodings, including ''WinAnsi'', ''MacRoman'', and a large number of encodings for East Asian languages, and a font can have its own built-in encoding. (Although the WinAnsi and MacRoman encodings are derived from the historical properties of the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Macintosh]] operating systems, fonts using these encodings work equally well on any platform.) PDF can specify a predefined encoding to use, the font's built-in encoding or provide a lookup table of differences to a predefined or built-in encoding (not recommended with TrueType fonts).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf |title=PDF Reference Sixth Edition, version 1.7, table 5.11}}</ref> The encoding mechanisms in PDF were designed for Type 1 fonts, and the rules for applying them to TrueType fonts are complex.\n\nFor large fonts or fonts with non-standard glyphs, the special encodings ''Identity-H'' (for horizontal writing) and ''Identity-V'' (for vertical) are used. With such fonts it is necessary to provide a ''ToUnicode'' table if semantic information about the characters is to be preserved.\n\n==== Transparency ====\nThe original imaging model of PDF was, like PostScript's, ''opaque'': each object drawn on the page completely replaced anything previously marked in the same location. In PDF 1.4 the imaging model was extended to allow transparency. When transparency is used, new objects interact with previously marked objects to produce blending effects. The addition of transparency to PDF was done by means of new extensions that were designed to be ignored in products written to the PDF 1.3 and earlier specifications. As a result, files that use a small amount of transparency might view acceptably in older viewers, but files making extensive use of transparency could be viewed incorrectly in an older viewer without warning.\n\nThe transparency extensions are based on the key concepts of ''transparency groups'', ''blending modes'', ''shape'', and ''alpha''. The model is closely aligned with the features of [[Adobe Illustrator]] version 9. The blend modes were based on those used by [[Adobe Photoshop]] at the time. When the PDF 1.4 specification was published, the formulas for calculating blend modes were kept secret by Adobe. They have since been published.<ref>[https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/pdf/pdfs/pdf_reference_archives/blend_modes.pdf PDF Blend Modes Addendum]</ref>\n\nThe concept of a transparency group in PDF specification is independent of existing notions of \"group\" or \"layer\" in applications such as Adobe Illustrator. Those groupings reflect logical relationships among objects that are meaningful when editing those objects, but they are not part of the imaging model.\n\n=== Interactive elements ===\nPDF files may contain interactive elements such as annotations, form fields, video, 3D and rich media.\n\n'''Rich Media PDF''' is a PDF file including interactive content that can be embedded or linked within the file.\n\n'''Interactive Forms''' is a mechanism to add forms to the PDF file format.\n\nPDF currently supports two different methods for integrating data and PDF forms. Both formats today coexist in the PDF specification:<ref name=\"iso32000\">{{citation |url=https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf |title=Document Management \u2013 Portable Document Format \u2013 Part 1: PDF 1.7, First Edition |author=Adobe Systems Incorporated |date=2008-07-01 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://gnupdf.org/Forms_Data_Format |title=Gnu PDF \u2013 PDF Knowledge \u2013 Forms Data Format |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130101054615/http://www.gnupdf.org/Forms_Data_Format |archivedate=2013-01-01 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://livedocs.adobe.com/coldfusion/8/htmldocs/help.html?content=formsPDF_02.html |title=About PDF forms |accessdate=2010-02-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429032948/http://livedocs.adobe.com/coldfusion/8/htmldocs/help.html?content=formsPDF_02.html |archivedate=2011-04-29 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.adobe.com/thread/301733|title=Convert XFA Form to AcroForm?|last=Demling|first=Peter|date=July 1, 2008|accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref>\n* '''AcroForms''' (also known as '''Acrobat forms'''), introduced in the PDF 1.2 format specification and included in all later PDF specifications.\n* [[XML Forms Architecture|Adobe XML Forms Architecture]] (XFA) forms, introduced in the PDF 1.5 format specification.

AcroForms permit using objects (''e.g.'' [[text box]]es, [[Radio button]]s, ''etc.'') and some code (''e.g.'' [[JavaScript]]).\n\nAlongside the standard PDF action types, interactive forms (AcroForms) support submitting, resetting, and importing data. The \"submit\" action transmits the names and values of selected interactive form fields to a specified uniform resource locator (URL). Interactive form field names and values may be submitted in any of the following formats, (depending on the settings of the action's ExportFormat, SubmitPDF, and XFDF flags):<ref name=\"iso32000\" />\n* HTML Form format (HTML 4.01 Specification since PDF 1.5; HTML 2.0 since 1.2)\n* Forms Data Format (FDF)\n* XML Forms Data Format (XFDF) (external XML Forms Data Format Specification, Version 2.0; supported since PDF 1.5; it replaced the \"XML\" form submission format defined in PDF 1.4)\n* PDF (the entire document can be submitted rather than individual fields and values, as was defined in PDF 1.4.)\n\nAcroForms can keep form field values in external stand-alone files containing key:value pairs.

Forms Data Format is defined in the PDF specification (since PDF 1.2). The Forms Data Format can be used when submitting form data to a server, receiving the response, and incorporating into the interactive form. It can also be used to export form data to stand-alone files that can be imported back into the corresponding PDF interactive form.\n\n===== XML Forms Data Format (XFDF) =====\n{{Infobox file format\n| name                   = XML Forms Data Format (XFDF)\n| icon                   =\n| logo                   =\n| screenshot             =\n| caption                =\n| extension              = .xfdf\n| mime                   = application/vnd.adobe.xfdf<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/vnd.adobe.xfdf |title=IANA Application Media Types \u2013 Vendor Tree \u2013 vnd.adobe.xfdf |accessdate=2010-02-22}}</ref>\n| type code              = 'XFDF'\n| uniform type           =\n| magic                  =\n| owner                  = [[Adobe Systems]]\n| released               = {{Start date|2003|07|df=yes}} (referenced in PDF 1.5)\n| latest release version = 3.0\n| latest release date    = {{Start date and age|2009|08|df=yes}}\n| genre                  =\n| container for          =\n| contained by           =\n| extended from          = PDF, FDF, [[XML]]\n| extended to            =\n| standard               = ISO 19444-1<ref name=\"iso-xfdf\">{{citation |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?ics1=35&ics2=240&ics3=30&csnumber=64911 |title=ISO/CD 19444-1 \u2013 Document management \u2013 XML Forms Data Format \u2013 Part 1: Use of ISO 32000-2 (XFDF 3.0) |accessdate=2017-05-28}}</ref>)\n| free                   =\n| url                    = [https://web.archive.org/web/20160408204348/https://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/xml/XFDF_Spec_3.0.pdf XFDF 3.0 specification]\n}}\n\nXML Forms Data Format (XFDF) is the XML version of Forms Data Format, but the XFDF implements only a subset of FDF containing forms and annotations. There are not XFDF equivalents for some entries in the FDF dictionary \u2013 such as the Status, Encoding, JavaScript, Pages keys, EmbeddedFDFs, Differences and Target. In addition, XFDF does not allow the spawning, or addition, of new pages based on the given data; as can be done when using an FDF file. The XFDF specification is referenced (but not included) in PDF 1.5 specification (and in later versions). It is described separately in ''XML Forms Data Format Specification''.<ref name=\"xfdf\" /> The PDF 1.4 specification allowed form submissions in XML format, but this was replaced by submissions in XFDF format in the PDF 1.5 specification. XFDF conforms to the XML standard.\n\nAs of December 2016, XFDF 3.0 is an ISO/IEC standard under the formal name ''ISO 19444-1:2016 \u2013 Document management \u2013 XML Forms Data Format \u2013 Part 1: Use of ISO 32000-2 (XFDF 3.0)''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/standard/64911.html|title=ISO 19444-1:2016 \u2013 Document management -- XML Forms Data Format -- Part 1: Use of ISO 32000-2 (XFDF 3.0)|website=www.iso.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-28}}</ref> This standard is a normative reference of ISO 32000-2.\n\nXFDF can be used in the same way as FDF; e.g., form data is submitted to a server, modifications are made, then sent back and the new form data is imported in an interactive form. It can also be used to export form data to stand-alone files that can be imported back into the corresponding PDF interactive form.\n\n==== Adobe XML Forms Architecture (XFA) ====\n{{main|XFA}}\nIn PDF 1.5, Adobe Systems introduced a proprietary format for forms; [[Adobe XML Forms Architecture]] (XFA). Adobe XFA Forms are not compatible with ISO 32000's AcroForms feature, and most PDF processors do not handle XFA content. The XFA specification is referenced from ISO 32000-1/PDF 1.7 as an external proprietary specification, and was entirely deprecated from PDF with ISO 32000-2 (PDF 2.0).\n\n=== Logical structure and accessibility ===\nA \"tagged\" PDF (see clause 14.8 in ISO 32000) includes document structure and semantics information to enable reliable text extraction and [[accessibility]]. Technically speaking, tagged PDF is a stylized use of the format that builds on the logical structure framework introduced in PDF 1.3. Tagged PDF defines a set of standard structure types and attributes that allow page content (text, graphics, and images) to be extracted and reused for other purposes.<ref>Duff Johnson, April 22, 2004 [https://web.archive.org/web/20040807132851/http://www.planetpdf.com/enterprise/article.asp?ContentID=6067 What is Tagged PDF?]</ref>\n\nTagged PDF is not required in situations where a PDF file is intended only for print. Since the feature is optional, and since the rules for Tagged PDF were relatively vague in ISO 32000-1, support for tagged PDF amongst consuming devices, including [[assistive technology]] (AT), is uneven at this time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/doit/Stem/articles?1002|title=Is PDF accessible?|work=washington.edu}}</ref> ISO 32000-2, however, includes an improved discussion of tagged PDF which is anticipated to facilitate further adoption.\n\nAn ISO-standardized subset of PDF specifically targeted at accessibility; [[PDF/UA]], was first published in 2012.\n\n===Optional Content Groups (layers of it) ===\nWith the introduction of PDF version, 1.5 (2003) came the concept of Layers. Layers, or as they are more formally known Optional Content Groups (OCGs), refer to sections of content in a PDF document that can be selectively viewed or hidden by document authors or consumers. This capability is useful in CAD drawings, layered artwork, maps, multi-language documents etc.\nBasically, it consists of an Optional Content Properties Dictionary added to the document root. This dictionary contains an array of Optional Content Groups (OCGs), each describing a set of information and each of which may be individually displayed or suppressed, plus a set of Optional Content Configuration Dictionaries, which give the status (Displayed or Suppressed) of the given OCGs.\n\n=== Security and signatures ===\nA PDF file may be encrypted for security, or digitally signed for authentication.\n\nThe standard security provided by Acrobat PDF consists of two different methods and two different passwords: a ''user password'', which encrypts the file and prevents opening, and an ''owner password'', which specifies operations that should be restricted even when the document is decrypted, which can include modifying, printing, or copying text and graphics out of the document, or adding or modifying text notes and [[#AcroForms|AcroForm]] fields. The user password encrypts the file, while the owner password does not, instead relying on client software to respect these restrictions. An owner password can easily be removed by software, including some free online services.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://freemypdf.com/ |title = FreeMyPDF.com \u2013 Removes passwords from viewable PDFs |website = freemypdf.com }}</ref> Thus, the use restrictions that a document author places on a PDF document are not secure, and cannot be assured once the file is distributed; this warning is displayed when applying such restrictions using Adobe Acrobat software to create or edit PDF files.\n\nEven without removing the password, most freeware or open source PDF readers ignore the permission \"protections\" and allow the user to print or make copy of excerpts of the text as if the document were not limited by password protection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1137343/pdf.html|title=Adobe admits new PDF password protection is weaker|author=Jeremy Kirk|date=December 5, 2008|website=[[Macworld]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Adobe/Gallery/PDFsecurity.pdf  |title= How secure is PDF |author=Bryan Guignard}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.planetpdf.com/planetpdf/pdfs/pdf2k/01W/merz_securitykeynote.pdf |title= PDF Security Overview: Strengths and Weaknesses }}</ref>\n\nThere are a number of commercial solutions that offer more robust means of [[information rights management]]. Not only can they restrict document access but they also reliably enforce [[File system permissions|permissions]] in ways that the standard security handler does not.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.locklizard.com/pdf_security_drm/ |title=PDF DRM Security Software for Adobe Document Protection}}</ref>\n\n==== Usage rights ====\nBeginning with PDF 1.5, Usage rights (UR) signatures are used to enable additional interactive features that are not available by default in a particular PDF viewer application. The signature is used to validate that the permissions have been granted by a [[bona fide]] granting authority. For example, it can be used to allow a user:<ref name=\"iso32000\" />\n* To save the PDF document along with modified form and/or annotation data\n* Import form data files in FDF, XFDF, and text (CSV/TSV) formats\n* Export form data files in FDF and XFDF formats\n* Submit form data\n* [[wikt:instantiate|Instantiate]] new pages from named page templates\n* Apply a [[digital signature]] to existing digital signature form field\n* Create, delete, modify, copy, import, and export annotations\n\nFor example, Adobe Systems grants permissions to enable additional features in Adobe Reader, using [[public-key cryptography]]. Adobe Reader verifies that the signature uses a [[Public key certificate|certificate]] from an Adobe-authorized certificate authority. Any PDF application can use this same mechanism for its own purposes.<ref name=\"iso32000\" />\n\n=== File attachments ===\nPDF files can have file attachments which processors may access and open or save to a local filesystem.\n\n=== Metadata ===\nPDF files can contain two types of metadata.<ref>[https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf Adobe PDF reference version 1.7], section 10.2</ref> The first is the Document Information Dictionary, a set of key/value fields such as author, title, subject, creation and update dates. This is stored in the optional Info trailer of the file. A small set of fields is defined, and can be extended with additional text values if required. This method is deprecated in PDF 2.0.\n\nIn PDF 1.4, support was added for Metadata Streams, using the [[Extensible Metadata Platform]] (XMP) to add XML standards-based extensible metadata as used in other file formats. This allows metadata to be attached to any stream in the document, such as information about embedded illustrations, as well as the whole document (attaching to the document catalog), using an extensible schema.\n\n=== Usage restrictions and monitoring ===\nPDFs may be [[encrypted]] so that a password is needed to view or edit the contents. PDF 2.0 defines 256-bit AES encryption as standard for PDF 2.0 files. The PDF Reference also defines ways that third parties can define their own encryption systems for PDF.\n\nPDF files may be digitally signed; complete details on implementing digital signatures in PDF is provided in ISO 32000-2.\n\nPDF files may also contain embedded [[digital rights management|DRM]] restrictions that provide further controls that limit copying, editing or printing. These restrictions depend on the reader software to obey them, so the security they provide is limited.\n\n=== Default display settings ===\nPDF documents can contain display settings, including the page display layout and zoom level. Adobe Reader uses these settings to override the user's default settings when opening the document.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.adobepress.com/articles/article.asp?p=412914 |title=Getting Familiar with Adobe Reader &gt; Understanding Preferences|accessdate=2009-04-22 }}</ref> The free Adobe Reader cannot remove these settings.\n\n== Intellectual property ==\nAnyone may create applications that can read and write PDF files without having to pay royalties to [[Adobe Systems]]; Adobe holds patents to PDF, but licenses them for [[royalty-free]] use in developing software complying with its PDF specification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/support/topic_legal_notices.html|title=Developer Resources|website=adobe.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160227041714/http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/support/topic_legal_notices.html|archivedate=2016-02-27}}</ref>\n\n== Technical issues ==\n=== Accessibility ===\nPDF files can be created specifically to be accessible for disabled people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webaim.org/techniques/acrobat/ |title=PDF Accessibility |publisher=WebAIM |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alistapart.com/articles/pdf_accessibility |title=Facts and Opinions About PDF Accessibility |author=Joe Clark |date=2005-08-22 |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://wac.osu.edu/pdf/ |title=Accessibility and PDF documents |publisher=Web Accessibility Center |accessdate=2010-04-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427062242/http://wac.osu.edu/pdf/ |archivedate=2010-04-27 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/accessibility/accessible_pdf.shtml |title=PDF Accessibility Standards v1.2 |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=http://www.csus.edu/training/handouts/workshops/creating_accessible_pdfs.pdf |format=PDF |title=PDF Accessibility |publisher=California State University |accessdate=2010-04-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527215445/http://www.csus.edu/training/handouts/workshops/creating_accessible_pdfs.pdf |archivedate=2010-05-27 }}</ref> PDF file formats in use {{As of|2014|lc=on}} can include tags, text equivalents, captions, audio descriptions, and more.

Adding tags to older PDFs and those that are generated from scanned documents can present some challenges.\n\nOne of the significant challenges with PDF accessibility is that PDF documents have three distinct views, which, depending on the document's creation, can be inconsistent with each other. The three views are (i) the physical view, (ii) the tags view, and (iii) the content view. The physical view is displayed and printed (what most people consider a PDF document). The tags view is what screen readers and other assistive technologies use to deliver a high-quality navigation and reading experience to users with disabilities. The content view is based on the physical order of objects within the PDF's content stream and may be displayed by software that does not fully support the tags view, such as the Reflow feature in Adobe's Reader.\n\n[[PDF/UA]], the International Standard for accessible PDF based on ISO 32000-1 was first published as ISO 14289\u20131 in 2012, and establishes normative language for accessible PDF technology.\n\n=== Viruses and exploits ===\n{{See also|Adobe Acrobat#Security}}\n\nPDF attachments carrying viruses were first discovered in 2001. The virus, named ''OUTLOOK.PDFWorm'' or ''Peachy'', uses [[Microsoft Outlook]] to send itself as an attachment to an Adobe PDF file. It was activated with Adobe Acrobat, but not with Acrobat Reader.<ref>Adobe Forums, [https://forums.adobe.com/thread/302989 Announcement: PDF Attachment Virus \"Peachy\"], 15 August 2001.</ref>\n\nFrom time to time, new vulnerabilities are discovered in various versions of Adobe Reader,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/support/security/#readerwin |title=Security bulletins and advisories |publisher=Adobe |date= |accessdate=2010-02-21}}</ref> prompting the company to issue security fixes. Other PDF readers are also susceptible. One aggravating factor is that a PDF reader can be configured to start automatically if a web page has an embedded PDF file, providing a vector for attack. If a malicious web page contains an infected PDF file that takes advantage of a vulnerability in the PDF reader, the system may be compromised even if the browser is secure. Some of these vulnerabilities are a result of the PDF standard allowing PDF documents to be scripted with JavaScript. Disabling JavaScript execution in the PDF reader can help mitigate such future exploits, although it does not protect against exploits in other parts of the PDF viewing software. Security experts say that JavaScript is not essential for a PDF reader, and that the security benefit that comes from disabling JavaScript outweighs any compatibility issues caused.<ref>[http://www.grc.com/sn/sn-187.txt Steve Gibson \u2013 SecurityNow Podcast]</ref> One way of avoiding PDF file exploits is to have a local or web service convert files to another format before viewing.\n\nOn March 30, 2010 security researcher Didier Stevens reported an Adobe Reader and Foxit Reader exploit that runs a malicious executable if the user allows it to launch when asked.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.pcmag.com/securitywatch/2010/03/malicious_pdfs_execute_code_wi.php|title=Malicious PDFs Execute Code Without a Vulnerability|last=|first=|date=|work=PCMAG|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404034752/http://blogs.pcmag.com/securitywatch/2010/03/malicious_pdfs_execute_code_wi.php|archive-date=4 April 2010|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Content ==\nA PDF file is often a combination of [[vector graphics]], text, and [[bitmap graphics]]. The basic types of content in a PDF are:\n* Text stored as content streams (i.e., not encoded in [[plain text]])\n* Vector graphics for illustrations and designs that consist of shapes and lines\n* Raster graphics for photographs and other types of image\n* Multimedia objects in the document\n\nIn later PDF revisions, a PDF document can also support links (inside document or web page), forms, JavaScript (initially available as plugin for Acrobat 3.0), or any other types of embedded contents that can be handled using plug-ins.\n\nPDF 1.6 supports interactive 3D documents embedded in the PDF \u2013 3D drawings can be embedded using [[U3D]] or [[PRC (file format)|PRC]] and various other data formats.<ref name=\"3d#1\">{{cite web |url=https://www.adobe.com/manufacturing/resources/3dformats/ |title=3D supported formats |publisher=Adobe |date=2009-07-14 |accessdate=2010-02-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212072951/http://www.adobe.com/manufacturing/resources/3dformats/ |archivedate=2010-02-12 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/supported-file-formats-acrobat-reader.html#main_2D_and_3D_formats__Acrobat_9_Pro_Extended__Adobe_3D_Reviewer_|title=Supported file formats in Acrobat and Reader|website=helpx.adobe.com|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/javascript_acrobt_3d.html|title=JavaScript for Acrobat 3D {{!}} Adobe Acrobat Developer Center|website=www.adobe.com|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref>\n\nTwo PDF files that look similar on a computer screen may be of very different sizes. For example, a high-resolution raster image takes more space than a low-resolution one. Typically higher resolution is needed for printing documents than for displaying them on screen. Other things that may increase the size of a file is embedding full fonts, especially for Asiatic scripts, and storing text as graphics.\n\n== Software ==\n{{Main list|List of PDF software}}\n\nPDF viewers are generally provided free of charge, and many versions are available from a variety of sources.\n\nThere are many software options for creating PDFs, including the PDF printing capabilities built into [[macOS]], [[iOS]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iphonehacks.com/2017/10/how-to-create-pdf-web-page-safari-iphone-ipad-ios-11.html|title=How to Create a PDF from Web Page on iPhone and iPad in iOS 11|last=Pathak|first=Khamosh|date=October 7, 2017|website=iPhone Hacks|access-date=February 2, 2018}}</ref> and most [[Linux]] distributions, [[LibreOffice]], [[Microsoft Office 2007]] (if updated to [[Office 2007#Service Pack 2|SP2]]) and later,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/953195|title=Description of 2007 Microsoft Office Suite Service Pack 2 (SP2)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429212434/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/953195|archive-date=29 April 2009|accessdate=2009-05-09}}</ref> [[WordPerfect]] 9, [[Scribus]], numerous PDF print drivers for [[Microsoft Windows]], the [[pdfTeX]] typesetting system, the [[DocBook]] PDF tools, applications developed around [[Ghostscript]] and [[Adobe Acrobat]] itself as well as [[Adobe InDesign]], [[Adobe FrameMaker]], [[Adobe Illustrator]], [[Adobe Photoshop]]. [[Google]]'s online office suite [[Google Docs]] also allows for uploading and saving to PDF.\n\n[[Raster image processor]]s (RIPs) are used to convert PDF files into a [[raster graphics|raster format]] suitable for imaging onto paper and other media in printers, digital production presses and [[prepress]] in a process known as [[rasterisation]]. RIPs capable of processing PDF directly include the Adobe PDF Print Engine<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/products/pdfprintengine/overview.html|title=Adobe PDF Print Engine|work=adobe.com}}</ref> from [[Adobe Systems]] and Jaws<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalgraphics.com/products/jaws_rip/|title=Jaws\u00ae 3.0 PDF and PostScript RIP SDK|work=globalgraphics.com}}</ref> and the [[Harlequin RIP]] from [[Global Graphics]].\n\n=== Conversions ===\nDocuments saved in PDF (Portable Document Format, Portable Document Format for Archiving, Forms Data Format, any printable document) could be [[data conversion|converted]] back and forth from many other formats such as:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pdftron.com/pdf-sdk/supported-file-formats|title=Supported File Formats|publisher=[[PDFTron Systems]]}}</ref>\n* Microsoft Office formats, \n* Rich Text Format, \n* Open office,\n* WordPerfect, \n* Microsoft Windows Bitmap, \n* Windows Metafile,\n* Enhanced Metafile,\n* Graphics Interchange Format,\n* Microsoft HD Photo File,\n* JPEG File Interchange,\n* JPEG 2000 File Format and Code Stream,\n* Portable Network Graphics,\n* Tagged Image File,\n* HyperText Markup Language,\n* MIME Encapsulation of Aggregate HTML Documents,\n* Scalable Vector Graphics,\n* Microsoft Outlook, Text,\n* XML Paper Specification,\n* Extensible Markup Language,\n* Silverlight XPS Document,\n* Extensible Application Markup Language \n\nCompanies such as [[Adobe Acrobat]] provide [[Software development kit|SDK]] libraries for developers to add and create PDF features in any software. Besides the [[Adobe PDF Library]], there are other [[List of PDF software#Development libraries|development libraries]] available.\n\n=== Annotation ===\n{{See also|Comparison of notetaking software}}\n\n[[Adobe Acrobat]] is one example of proprietary software that allows the user to annotate, highlight, and add notes to already created PDF files. One UNIX application available as [[free software]] (under the [[GNU General Public License]]) is [[PDFedit]]. The [[freeware]] [[Foxit Reader]], available for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]] and [[Linux]], allows annotating documents. Tracker Software's [[PDF-XChange Viewer]] allows annotations and markups without restrictions in its freeware alternative. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[macOS]]'s integrated PDF viewer, Preview, does also enable annotations as does the open source software [[Skim (software)|Skim]], with the latter supporting interaction with [[LaTeX]], SyncTeX, and PDFSync and integration with [[BibDesk]] reference management software. Freeware [[Qiqqa]] can create an annotation report that summarizes all the annotations and notes one has made across their library of PDFs. The [[Text Verification Tool]] exports differences in documents as annotations and markups.\n\nThere are also [[web annotation]] systems that support annotation in pdf and other documents formats. In cases where PDFs are expected to have all of the functionality of paper documents, ink annotation is required.\n\n=== Other ===\nExamples of PDF software as online services including [[Scribd]] for viewing and storing, [[Pdfvue]] for online editing, and [[ThinkFree Office|Thinkfree]], [[Zamzar]] for conversion.\n\nIn 1993 the Jaws [[raster image processor]] from [[Global Graphics]] became the first shipping prepress RIP that interpreted PDF natively without conversion to another format. The company released an upgrade to their Harlequin RIP with the same capability in 1997.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.globalgraphics.com/products/harlequin-multi-rip |title=Harlequin MultiRIP|accessdate=2014-03-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209215413/http://www.globalgraphics.com/products/harlequin-multi-rip/|archivedate=2014-02-09 }}</ref>\n\n[[Agfa-Gevaert]] introduced and shipped Apogee, the first prepress workflow system based on PDF, in 1997.\n\nMany commercial offset printers have accepted the submission of press-ready PDF files as a print source, specifically the PDF/X-1a subset and variations of the same.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090205151505/http://www.prepressx.com/ Press-Ready PDF Files] \"For anyone interested in having their graphic project commercially printed directly from digital files or PDFs.\" (last checked on 2009-02-10).</ref> The submission of press-ready PDF files are a replacement for the problematic need for receiving collected native working files.\n\nPDF was selected as the \"native\" [[metafile]] format for [[macOS|Mac OS X]], replacing the [[PICT]] format of the earlier [[classic Mac OS]]. The imaging model of the [[Quartz (graphics layer)|Quartz]] graphics layer is based on the model common to [[Display PostScript]] and PDF, leading to the nickname ''Display PDF''. The Preview application can display PDF files, as can version 2.0 and later of the [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] web browser. System-level support for PDF allows Mac OS X applications to create PDF documents automatically, provided they support the OS-standard printing architecture. The files are then exported in PDF 1.3 format according to the file header. When taking a screenshot under Mac OS X versions 10.0 through 10.3, the image was also captured as a PDF; later versions save screen captures as a [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] file, though this behaviour can be set back to PDF if desired.\n\nIn 2006 PDF was widely accepted as the standard print job format at the [[Open Source Development Labs]] Printing Summit. It is supported as a print job format by the [[CUPS|Common Unix Printing System]] and desktop application projects such as [[GNOME]], [[KDE]], [[Firefox]], [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird]], [[LibreOffice]] and [[OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice]] have switched to emit print jobs in PDF.<ref>{{cite web |title = PDF as Standard Print Job Format |url = http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/openprinting/pdf_as_standard_print_job_format |website=The Linux Foundation |publisher=[[Linux Foundation]] |accessdate=21 June 2016 }}</ref>\n\nSome desktop printers also support direct PDF printing, which can interpret PDF data without external help. \n\nThe [[Free Software Foundation]] once thought of as one of their [[High priority free software projects|high priority projects]] to be \"developing a free, high-quality and fully functional set of libraries and programs that implement the PDF file format and associated technologies to the ISO 32000 standard.\"<ref>On 2014-04-02, a note dated 2009-02-10 referred to [http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/priority.html Current FSF High Priority Free Software Projects] as a source.

It can handle graphics and standard features of [[programming language]]s such as <code>if</code> and <code>loop</code> commands. PDF is largely based on PostScript but simplified to remove flow control features like these, while graphics commands such as <code>lineto</code> remain.\n\nOften, the PostScript-like PDF code is generated from a source PostScript file. The graphics commands that are output by the PostScript code are collected and [[Lexical analysis|tokenized]]. Any files, graphics, or fonts to which the document refers also are collected. Then, everything is compressed to a single file. Therefore, the entire PostScript world (fonts, layout, measurements) remains intact.\n\nAs a document format, PDF has several advantages over PostScript:\n* PDF contains tokenized and interpreted results of the PostScript source code, for direct correspondence between changes to items in the PDF page description and changes to the resulting page appearance.\n* PDF (from version 1.4) supports [[transparency (graphic)|graphic transparency]]; PostScript does not.\n* PostScript is an [[interpreted programming language]] with an implicit global state, so instructions accompanying the description of one page can affect the appearance of any following page. Therefore, all preceding pages in a PostScript document must be processed to determine the correct appearance of a given page, whereas each page in a PDF document is unaffected by the others. As a result, PDF viewers allow the user to quickly jump to the final pages of a long document, whereas a PostScript viewer needs to process all pages sequentially before being able to display the destination page (unless the optional PostScript [[Document Structuring Conventions]] have been carefully complied and included).\n\n== Technical overview ==\n=== File structure ===\nA PDF file is a 7-bit [[ASCII]] file, except for certain elements that may have binary content.\nA PDF file starts with a header containing the [[File format#Magic number|magic number]] and the version of the format such as <code>%PDF-1.7</code>. The format is a subset of a COS (\"Carousel\" Object Structure) format.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://jimpravetz.com/blog/2012/12/in-defense-of-cos/ |title = In Defense of COS, or Why I Love JSON and Hate XML |first = Jim |last = Pravetz |website = jimpravetz.com }}</ref> A COS tree file consists primarily of ''objects'', of which there are eight types:<ref>Adobe Systems, PDF Reference, p.&nbsp;51.</ref>\n* [[Boolean data type|Boolean]] values, representing ''true'' or ''false''\n* Numbers\n* [[String (computer science)|Strings]], enclosed within parentheses (<code>(...)</code>), may contain 8-bit characters.\n* Names, starting with a forward slash (<code>/</code>)\n* [[Array data type|Arrays]], ordered collections of objects enclosed within square brackets (<code>[...]</code>)\n* [[Dictionary (data structure)|Dictionaries]], collections of objects indexed by Names enclosed within double pointy brackets (<code>&lt;&lt;...&gt;&gt;</code>)\n* [[Stream (computing)|Streams]], usually containing large amounts of data, which can be compressed and binary, between the <code>stream</code> and <code>endstream</code> keywords, preceded by a dictionary\n* The [[Pointer (computer programming)|null]] object\nFurthermore, there may be comments, introduced with the percent sign (<code>%</code>). Comments may contain 8-bit characters.\n\nObjects may be either ''direct'' (embedded in another object) or ''indirect''. Indirect objects are numbered with an ''object number'' and a ''generation number'' and defined between the <code>obj</code> and <code>endobj</code> keywords if residing in the document root. Beginning with PDF version 1.5, indirect objects (except other streams) may also be located in special streams known as ''object streams'' (marked <code>/Type /ObjStm</code>). This technique enables non-stream objects to have standard stream filters applied to them, reduces the size of files that have large numbers of small indirect objects and is especially useful for ''Tagged PDF''. Object streams do not support specifying an object's ''generation number'' (other than 0).\n\nAn index table, also called the cross-reference table, is typically located near the end of the file and gives the byte offset of each indirect object from the start of the file.<ref>Adobe Systems, PDF Reference, pp. 39\u201340.</ref> This design allows for efficient [[random access]] to the objects in the file, and also allows for small changes to be made without rewriting the entire file (''incremental update''). Before PDF version 1.5, the table would always be in a special ASCII format, be marked with the <code>xref</code> keyword, and follow the main body composed of indirect objects. Version 1.5 introduced optional ''cross-reference streams'', which have the form of a standard stream object, possibly with filters applied. Such a stream may be used instead of the ASCII cross-reference table and contains the offsets and other information in binary format. The format is flexible in that it allows for integer width specification (using the <code>/W</code> array), so that for example a document not exceeding 64&nbsp;[[KiB]] in size may dedicate only 2&nbsp;bytes for object offsets.\n\nAt the end of a PDF file is a footer containing:\n* The <code>startxref</code> keyword followed by an offset to the start of the cross-reference table (starting with the <code>xref</code> keyword) or the cross-reference stream object\n* And the <code>%%EOF</code> [[end-of-file]] marker.\n\nIf a cross-reference stream is not being used, the footer is preceded by the <code>trailer</code> keyword followed by a dictionary containing information that would otherwise be contained in the cross-reference stream object's dictionary:\n* A reference to the root object of the tree structure, also known as the ''catalog'' (<code>/Root</code>)\n* The count of indirect objects in the cross-reference table (<code>/Size</code>)\n* And other optional information.\n\nThere are two layouts to the PDF files: non-linear (not \"optimized\") and linear (\"optimized\"). Non-linear PDF files consume less disk space than their linear counterparts, though they are slower to access because portions of the data required to assemble pages of the document are scattered throughout the PDF file. Linear PDF files (also called \"optimized\" or \"web optimized\" PDF files) are constructed in a manner that enables them to be read in a Web browser plugin without waiting for the entire file to download, since they are written to disk in a linear (as in page order) fashion.<ref name=\"pdf-ref\">{{cite web |url=https://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference.html |title=Adobe Developer Connection: PDF Reference and Adobe Extensions to the PDF Specification |publisher=Adobe Systems |accessdate=2010-12-13}}</ref> PDF files may be optimized using [[Adobe Acrobat]] software or [[QPDF]].\n\n=== Imaging model ===\nThe basic design of how [[graphics]] are represented in PDF is very similar to that of PostScript, except for the use of [[transparency (graphic)|transparency]], which was added in PDF 1.4.\n\nPDF graphics use a [[device independence|device-independent]] [[Cartesian coordinate system]] to describe the surface of a page. A PDF page description can use a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] to [[scale (ratio)|scale]], [[rotate]], or [[Shear mapping|skew]] graphical elements. A key concept in PDF is that of the ''graphics state'', which is a collection of graphical parameters that may be changed, saved, and restored by a ''page description''. PDF has (as of version 1.6) 24 graphics state properties, of which some of the most important are:\n* The ''current transformation matrix'' (CTM), which determines the coordinate system\n* The ''[[clipping path]]''\n* The ''[[color space]]''\n* The ''[[alpha compositing|alpha constant]]'', which is a key component of transparency\n\n==== Vector graphics ====\nAs in PostScript, [[vector graphics]] in PDF are constructed with ''paths''. Paths are usually composed of lines and cubic [[B\u00e9zier curve]]s, but can also be constructed from the outlines of text. Unlike PostScript, PDF does not allow a single path to mix text outlines with lines and curves. Paths can be stroked, filled, [[clipping path|clipping]]. Strokes and fills can use any color set in the graphics state, including ''patterns''.\n\nPDF supports several types of patterns. The simplest is the ''tiling pattern'' in which a piece of artwork is specified to be drawn repeatedly. This may be a ''colored tiling pattern'', with the colors specified in the pattern object, or an ''uncolored tiling pattern'', which defers color specification to the time the pattern is drawn. Beginning with PDF 1.3 there is also a ''shading pattern'', which draws continuously varying colors. There are seven types of shading pattern of which the simplest are the ''axial shade'' (Type 2) and ''radial shade'' (Type 3). <!-- Pictures desperately needed here! -->\n\n==== Raster images ====\n[[Raster graphics|Raster images]] in PDF (called ''Image XObjects'') are represented by dictionaries with an associated stream. The dictionary describes properties of the image, and the stream contains the image data. (Less commonly, a raster image may be embedded directly in a page description as an ''inline image''.) Images are typically ''filtered'' for compression purposes. Image filters supported in PDF include the general purpose filters\n* '''ASCII85Decode''' a filter used to put the stream into 7-bit [[ASCII]]\n* '''ASCIIHexDecode''' similar to ASCII85Decode but less compact\n* '''FlateDecode''' a commonly used filter based on the [[deflate]] algorithm defined in {{IETF RFC|1951}} (deflate is also used in the [[gzip]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], and [[ZIP (file format)|zip]] file formats among others); introduced in PDF 1.2; it can use one of two groups of predictor functions for more compact zlib/deflate compression: ''Predictor 2'' from the [[TIFF]] 6.0 specification and predictors (filters) from the [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] specification ({{IETF RFC|2083}})\n* '''LZWDecode''' a filter based on [[LZW]] Compression; it can use one of two groups of predictor functions for more compact LZW compression: ''Predictor 2'' from the TIFF 6.0 specification and predictors (filters) from the PNG specification\n* '''RunLengthDecode''' a simple compression method for streams with repetitive data using the [[run-length encoding]] algorithm and the image-specific filters\n* '''DCTDecode''' a [[lossy]] filter based on the [[JPEG]] standard\n* '''CCITTFaxDecode''' a [[lossless]] [[bi-level image|bi-level]] (black/white) filter based on the Group 3 or [[Group 4 compression|Group 4]] [[CCITT]] (ITU-T) [[fax]] compression standard defined in ITU-T [[T.4]] and T.6\n* '''JBIG2Decode''' a lossy or lossless bi-level (black/white) filter based on the [[JBIG2]] standard, introduced in PDF 1.4\n* '''JPXDecode''' a lossy or lossless filter based on the [[JPEG 2000]] standard, introduced in PDF 1.5\n\nNormally all image content in a PDF is embedded in the file. But PDF allows image data to be stored in external files by the use of ''external streams'' or ''Alternate Images''. Standardized subsets of PDF, including [[PDF/A]] and [[PDF/X]], prohibit these features.\n\n==== Text ====\nText in PDF is represented by ''text elements'' in page content streams. A text element specifies that ''characters'' should be drawn at certain positions. The characters are specified using the ''encoding'' of a selected ''font resource''.\n\n===== Fonts =====\nA font object in PDF is a description of a digital [[typeface]]. It may either describe the characteristics of a typeface, or it may include an embedded ''font file''. The latter case is called an ''embedded font'' while the former is called an ''unembedded font''. The font files that may be embedded are based on widely used standard digital font formats: '''[[PostScript fonts|Type 1]]''' (and its compressed variant '''CFF'''), '''[[TrueType]]''', and (beginning with PDF 1.6) '''[[OpenType]]'''. Additionally PDF supports the '''Type 3''' variant in which the components of the font are described by PDF graphic operators. <!--- Type 3 bit is awkward and should be cleaned up --->\n\n===== Standard Type 1 Fonts (Standard 14 Fonts) =====\nFourteen typefaces, known as the ''standard 14 fonts'', have a special significance in PDF documents:\n* [[Times Roman|Times]] (v3) (in regular, italic, bold, and bold italic)\n* [[Courier (typeface)|Courier]] (in regular, oblique, bold and bold oblique)\n* [[Helvetica]] (v3) (in regular, oblique, bold and bold oblique)\n* [[Symbol (typeface)|Symbol]]\n* [[Zapf Dingbats]]\nThese fonts are sometimes called the ''base fourteen fonts''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://desktoppub.about.com/od/glossary/g/base14fonts.htm|title=Desktop Publishing: Base 14 Fonts \u2013 Definition|last=Howard|first=Jacci|work=About.com Tech|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160614134144/http://desktoppub.about.com/od/glossary/g/base14fonts.htm|archive-date=June 14, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> These fonts, or suitable substitute fonts with the same metrics, should be available in most PDF readers, but they are not ''guaranteed'' to be available in the reader, and may only display correctly if the system has them installed.<ref name=\"aquarium\">[http://www.planetpdf.com/planetpdf/pdfs/pdf2k/03e/merz_fontaquarium.pdf The PDF Font Aquarium]</ref> Fonts may be substituted if they are not embedded in a PDF.\n\n===== Encodings =====\nWithin text strings, characters are shown using ''character codes'' (integers) that map to glyphs in the current font using an ''encoding''. There are a number of predefined encodings, including ''WinAnsi'', ''MacRoman'', and a large number of encodings for East Asian languages, and a font can have its own built-in encoding. (Although the WinAnsi and MacRoman encodings are derived from the historical properties of the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Macintosh]] operating systems, fonts using these encodings work equally well on any platform.) PDF can specify a predefined encoding to use, the font's built-in encoding or provide a lookup table of differences to a predefined or built-in encoding (not recommended with TrueType fonts).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf |title=PDF Reference Sixth Edition, version 1.7, table 5.11}}</ref> The encoding mechanisms in PDF were designed for Type 1 fonts, and the rules for applying them to TrueType fonts are complex.\n\nFor large fonts or fonts with non-standard glyphs, the special encodings ''Identity-H'' (for horizontal writing) and ''Identity-V'' (for vertical) are used. With such fonts it is necessary to provide a ''ToUnicode'' table if semantic information about the characters is to be preserved.\n\n==== Transparency ====\nThe original imaging model of PDF was, like PostScript's, ''opaque'': each object drawn on the page completely replaced anything previously marked in the same location. In PDF 1.4 the imaging model was extended to allow transparency. When transparency is used, new objects interact with previously marked objects to produce blending effects. The addition of transparency to PDF was done by means of new extensions that were designed to be ignored in products written to the PDF 1.3 and earlier specifications. As a result, files that use a small amount of transparency might view acceptably in older viewers, but files making extensive use of transparency could be viewed incorrectly in an older viewer without warning.\n\nThe transparency extensions are based on the key concepts of ''transparency groups'', ''blending modes'', ''shape'', and ''alpha''. The model is closely aligned with the features of [[Adobe Illustrator]] version 9. The blend modes were based on those used by [[Adobe Photoshop]] at the time. When the PDF 1.4 specification was published, the formulas for calculating blend modes were kept secret by Adobe. They have since been published.<ref>[https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/pdf/pdfs/pdf_reference_archives/blend_modes.pdf PDF Blend Modes Addendum]</ref>\n\nThe concept of a transparency group in PDF specification is independent of existing notions of \"group\" or \"layer\" in applications such as Adobe Illustrator. Those groupings reflect logical relationships among objects that are meaningful when editing those objects, but they are not part of the imaging model.\n\n=== Interactive elements ===\nPDF files may contain interactive elements such as annotations, form fields, video, 3D and rich media.\n\n'''Rich Media PDF''' is a PDF file including interactive content that can be embedded or linked within the file.\n\n'''Interactive Forms''' is a mechanism to add forms to the PDF file format.\n\nPDF currently supports two different methods for integrating data and PDF forms. Both formats today coexist in the PDF specification:<ref name=\"iso32000\">{{citation |url=https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf |title=Document Management \u2013 Portable Document Format \u2013 Part 1: PDF 1.7, First Edition |author=Adobe Systems Incorporated |date=2008-07-01 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://gnupdf.org/Forms_Data_Format |title=Gnu PDF \u2013 PDF Knowledge \u2013 Forms Data Format |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130101054615/http://www.gnupdf.org/Forms_Data_Format |archivedate=2013-01-01 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://livedocs.adobe.com/coldfusion/8/htmldocs/help.html?content=formsPDF_02.html |title=About PDF forms |accessdate=2010-02-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429032948/http://livedocs.adobe.com/coldfusion/8/htmldocs/help.html?content=formsPDF_02.html |archivedate=2011-04-29 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.adobe.com/thread/301733|title=Convert XFA Form to AcroForm?|last=Demling|first=Peter|date=July 1, 2008|accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref>\n* '''AcroForms''' (also known as '''Acrobat forms'''), introduced in the PDF 1.2 format specification and included in all later PDF specifications.\n* [[XML Forms Architecture|Adobe XML Forms Architecture]] (XFA) forms, introduced in the PDF 1.5 format specification.

The \"submit\" action transmits the names and values of selected interactive form fields to a specified uniform resource locator (URL).

It can also be used to export form data to stand-alone files that can be imported back into the corresponding PDF interactive form.\n\n===== XML Forms Data Format (XFDF) =====\n{{Infobox file format\n| name                   = XML Forms Data Format (XFDF)\n| icon                   =\n| logo                   =\n| screenshot             =\n| caption                =\n| extension              = .xfdf\n| mime                   = application/vnd.adobe.xfdf<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/vnd.adobe.xfdf |title=IANA Application Media Types \u2013 Vendor Tree \u2013 vnd.adobe.xfdf |accessdate=2010-02-22}}</ref>\n| type code              = 'XFDF'\n| uniform type           =\n| magic                  =\n| owner                  = [[Adobe Systems]]\n| released               = {{Start date|2003|07|df=yes}} (referenced in PDF 1.5)\n| latest release version = 3.0\n| latest release date    = {{Start date and age|2009|08|df=yes}}\n| genre                  =\n| container for          =\n| contained by           =\n| extended from          = PDF, FDF, [[XML]]\n| extended to            =\n| standard               = ISO 19444-1<ref name=\"iso-xfdf\">{{citation |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?ics1=35&ics2=240&ics3=30&csnumber=64911 |title=ISO/CD 19444-1 \u2013 Document management \u2013 XML Forms Data Format \u2013 Part 1: Use of ISO 32000-2 (XFDF 3.0) |accessdate=2017-05-28}}</ref>)\n| free                   =\n| url                    = [https://web.archive.org/web/20160408204348/https://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/xml/XFDF_Spec_3.0.pdf XFDF 3.0 specification]\n}}\n\nXML Forms Data Format (XFDF) is the XML version of Forms Data Format, but the XFDF implements only a subset of FDF containing forms and annotations. There are not XFDF equivalents for some entries in the FDF dictionary \u2013 such as the Status, Encoding, JavaScript, Pages keys, EmbeddedFDFs, Differences and Target. In addition, XFDF does not allow the spawning, or addition, of new pages based on the given data; as can be done when using an FDF file. The XFDF specification is referenced (but not included) in PDF 1.5 specification (and in later versions). It is described separately in ''XML Forms Data Format Specification''.<ref name=\"xfdf\" /> The PDF 1.4 specification allowed form submissions in XML format, but this was replaced by submissions in XFDF format in the PDF 1.5 specification. XFDF conforms to the XML standard.\n\nAs of December 2016, XFDF 3.0 is an ISO/IEC standard under the formal name ''ISO 19444-1:2016 \u2013 Document management \u2013 XML Forms Data Format \u2013 Part 1: Use of ISO 32000-2 (XFDF 3.0)''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/standard/64911.html|title=ISO 19444-1:2016 \u2013 Document management -- XML Forms Data Format -- Part 1: Use of ISO 32000-2 (XFDF 3.0)|website=www.iso.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-28}}</ref> This standard is a normative reference of ISO 32000-2.\n\nXFDF can be used in the same way as FDF; e.g., form data is submitted to a server, modifications are made, then sent back and the new form data is imported in an interactive form. It can also be used to export form data to stand-alone files that can be imported back into the corresponding PDF interactive form.\n\n==== Adobe XML Forms Architecture (XFA) ====\n{{main|XFA}}\nIn PDF 1.5, Adobe Systems introduced a proprietary format for forms; [[Adobe XML Forms Architecture]] (XFA). Adobe XFA Forms are not compatible with ISO 32000's AcroForms feature, and most PDF processors do not handle XFA content. The XFA specification is referenced from ISO 32000-1/PDF 1.7 as an external proprietary specification, and was entirely deprecated from PDF with ISO 32000-2 (PDF 2.0).\n\n=== Logical structure and accessibility ===\nA \"tagged\" PDF (see clause 14.8 in ISO 32000) includes document structure and semantics information to enable reliable text extraction and [[accessibility]]. Technically speaking, tagged PDF is a stylized use of the format that builds on the logical structure framework introduced in PDF 1.3. Tagged PDF defines a set of standard structure types and attributes that allow page content (text, graphics, and images) to be extracted and reused for other purposes.<ref>Duff Johnson, April 22, 2004 [https://web.archive.org/web/20040807132851/http://www.planetpdf.com/enterprise/article.asp?ContentID=6067 What is Tagged PDF?]</ref>\n\nTagged PDF is not required in situations where a PDF file is intended only for print. Since the feature is optional, and since the rules for Tagged PDF were relatively vague in ISO 32000-1, support for tagged PDF amongst consuming devices, including [[assistive technology]] (AT), is uneven at this time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/doit/Stem/articles?1002|title=Is PDF accessible?|work=washington.edu}}</ref> ISO 32000-2, however, includes an improved discussion of tagged PDF which is anticipated to facilitate\n\nAn ISO-standardized subset of PDF specifically targeted at accessibility; [[PDF/UA]], was first published in 2012.\n\n===Optional Content Groups (layers of it) ===\nWith the introduction of PDF version, 1.5 (2003) came the concept of Layers. Layers, or as they are more formally known Optional Content Groups (OCGs), refer to sections of content in a PDF document that can be selectively viewed or hidden by document authors or consumers. This capability is useful in CAD drawings, layered artwork, maps, multi-language documents etc.\nBasically, it consists of an Optional Content Properties Dictionary added to the document root. This dictionary contains an array of Optional Content Groups (OCGs), each describing a set of information and each of which may be individually displayed or suppressed, plus a set of Optional Content Configuration Dictionaries, which give the status (Displayed or Suppressed) of the given OCGs.\n\n=== Security and signatures ===\nA PDF file may be encrypted for security, or digitally signed for authentication.\n\nThe standard security provided by Acrobat PDF consists of two different methods and two different passwords: a ''user password'', which encrypts the file and prevents opening, and an ''owner password'', which specifies operations that should be restricted even when the document is decrypted, which can include modifying, printing, or copying text and graphics out of the document, or adding or modifying text notes and [[#AcroForms|AcroForm]] fields. The user password encrypts the file, while the owner password does not, instead relying on client software to respect these restrictions. An owner password can easily be removed by software, including some free online services.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://freemypdf.com/ |title = FreeMyPDF.com \u2013 Removes passwords from viewable PDFs |website = freemypdf.com }}</ref> Thus, the use restrictions that a document author places on a PDF document are not secure, and cannot be assured once the file is distributed; this warning is displayed when applying such restrictions using Adobe Acrobat software to create or edit PDF files.\n\nEven without removing the password, most freeware or open source PDF readers ignore the permission \"protections\" and allow the user to print or make copy of excerpts of the text as if the document were not limited by password protection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1137343/pdf.html|title=Adobe admits new PDF password protection is weaker|author=Jeremy Kirk|date=December 5, 2008|website=[[Macworld]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Adobe/Gallery/PDFsecurity.pdf  |title= How secure is PDF |author=Bryan Guignard}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.planetpdf.com/planetpdf/pdfs/pdf2k/01W/merz_securitykeynote.pdf |title= PDF Security Overview: Strengths and Weaknesses }}</ref>\n\nThere are a number of commercial solutions that offer more robust means of [[information rights management]]. Not only can they restrict document access but they also reliably enforce [[File system permissions|permissions]] in ways that the standard security handler does not.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.locklizard.com/pdf_security_drm/ |title=PDF DRM Security Software for Adobe Document Protection}}</ref>\n\n==== Usage rights ====\nBeginning with PDF 1.5, Usage rights (UR) signatures are used to enable additional interactive features that are not available by default in a particular PDF viewer application. The signature is used to validate that the permissions have been granted by a [[bona fide]] granting authority. For example, it can be used to allow a user:<ref name=\"iso32000\" />\n* To save the PDF document along with modified form and/or annotation data\n* Import form data files in FDF, XFDF, and text (CSV/TSV) formats\n* Export form data files in FDF and XFDF formats\n* Submit form data\n* [[wikt:instantiate|Instantiate]] new pages from named page templates\n* Apply a [[digital signature]] to existing digital signature form field\n* Create, delete, modify, copy, import, and export annotations\n\nFor example, Adobe Systems grants permissions to enable additional features in Adobe Reader, using [[public-key cryptography]]. Adobe Reader verifies that the signature uses a [[Public key certificate|certificate]] from an Adobe-authorized certificate authority. Any PDF application can use this same mechanism for its own purposes.<ref name=\"iso32000\" />\n\n=== File attachments ===\nPDF files can have file attachments which processors may access and open or save to a local filesystem.\n\n=== Metadata ===\nPDF files can contain two types of metadata.<ref>[https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf Adobe PDF reference version 1.7], section 10.2</ref> The first is the Document Information Dictionary, a set of key/value fields such as author, title, subject, creation and update dates. This is stored in the optional Info trailer of the file. A small set of fields is defined, and can be extended with additional text values if required. This method is deprecated in PDF 2.0.\n\nIn PDF 1.4, support was added for Metadata Streams, using the [[Extensible Metadata Platform]] (XMP) to add XML standards-based extensible metadata as used in other file formats. This allows metadata to be attached to any stream in the document, such as information about embedded illustrations, as well as the whole document (attaching to the document catalog), using an extensible schema.\n\n=== Usage restrictions and monitoring ===\nPDFs may be [[encrypted]] so that a password is needed to view or edit the contents. PDF 2.0 defines 256-bit AES encryption as standard for PDF 2.0 files. The PDF Reference also defines ways that third parties can define their own encryption systems for PDF.\n\nPDF files may be digitally signed; complete details on implementing digital signatures in PDF is provided in ISO 32000-2.\n\nPDF files may also contain embedded [[digital rights management|DRM]] restrictions that provide further controls that limit copying, editing or printing. These restrictions depend on the reader software to obey them, so the security they provide is limited.\n\n=== Default display settings ===\nPDF documents can contain display settings, including the page display layout and zoom level. Adobe Reader uses these settings to override the user's default settings when opening the document.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.adobepress.com/articles/article.asp?p=412914 |title=Getting Familiar with Adobe Reader &gt; Understanding Preferences|accessdate=2009-04-22 }}</ref> The free Adobe Reader cannot remove these settings.\n\n== Intellectual property ==\nAnyone may create applications that can read and write PDF files without having to pay royalties to [[Adobe Systems]]; Adobe holds patents to PDF, but licenses them for [[royalty-free]] use in developing software complying with its PDF specification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/support/topic_legal_notices.html|title=Developer Resources|website=adobe.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160227041714/http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/support/topic_legal_notices.html|archivedate=2016-02-27}}</ref>\n\n== Technical issues ==\n=== Accessibility ===\nPDF files can be created specifically to be accessible for disabled people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webaim.org/techniques/acrobat/ |title=PDF Accessibility |publisher=WebAIM |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alistapart.com/articles/pdf_accessibility |title=Facts and Opinions About PDF Accessibility |author=Joe Clark |date=2005-08-22 |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://wac.osu.edu/pdf/ |title=Accessibility and PDF documents |publisher=Web Accessibility Center |accessdate=2010-04-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427062242/http://wac.osu.edu/pdf/ |archivedate=2010-04-27 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/accessibility/accessible_pdf.shtml |title=PDF Accessibility Standards v1.2 |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=http://www.csus.edu/training/handouts/workshops/creating_accessible_pdfs.pdf |format=PDF |title=PDF Accessibility |publisher=California State University |accessdate=2010-04-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527215445/http://www.csus.edu/training/handouts/workshops/creating_accessible_pdfs.pdf |archivedate=2010-05-27 }}</ref> PDF file formats in use {{As of|2014|lc=on}} can include tags, text equivalents, captions, audio descriptions, and more.

Adding tags to older PDFs and those that are generated from scanned documents can present some challenges.\n\nOne of the significant challenges with PDF accessibility is that PDF documents have three distinct views, which, depending on the document's creation, can be inconsistent with each other. The three views are (i) the physical view, (ii) the tags view, and (iii) the content view. The physical view is displayed and printed (what most people consider a PDF document). The tags view is what screen readers and other assistive technologies use to deliver a high-quality navigation and reading experience to users with disabilities. The content view is based on the physical order of objects within the PDF's content stream and may be displayed by software that does not fully support the tags view, such as the Reflow feature in Adobe's Reader.\n\n[[PDF/UA]], the International Standard for accessible PDF based on ISO 32000-1 was first published as ISO 14289\u20131 in 2012, and establishes normative language for accessible PDF technology.\n\n=== Viruses and exploits ===\n{{See also|Adobe Acrobat#Security}}\n\nPDF attachments carrying viruses were first discovered in 2001. The virus, named ''OUTLOOK.PDFWorm'' or ''Peachy'', uses [[Microsoft Outlook]] to send itself as an attachment to an Adobe PDF file. It was activated with Adobe Acrobat, but not with Acrobat Reader.<ref>Adobe Forums, [https://forums.adobe.com/thread/302989 Announcement: PDF Attachment Virus \"Peachy\"], 15 August 2001.</ref>\n\nFrom time to time, new vulnerabilities are discovered in various versions of Adobe Reader,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/support/security/#readerwin |title=Security bulletins and advisories |publisher=Adobe |date= |accessdate=2010-02-21}}</ref> prompting the company to issue security fixes. Other PDF readers are also susceptible. One aggravating factor is that a PDF reader can be configured to start automatically if a web page has an embedded PDF file, providing a vector for attack. If a malicious web page contains an infected PDF file that takes advantage of a vulnerability in the PDF reader, the system may be compromised even if the browser is secure. Some of these vulnerabilities are a result of the PDF standard allowing PDF documents to be scripted with JavaScript. Disabling JavaScript execution in the PDF reader can help mitigate such future exploits, although it does not protect against exploits in other parts of the PDF viewing software. Security experts say that JavaScript is not essential for a PDF reader, and that the security benefit that comes from disabling JavaScript outweighs any compatibility issues caused.<ref>[http://www.grc.com/sn/sn-187.txt Steve Gibson \u2013 SecurityNow Podcast]</ref> One way of avoiding PDF file exploits is to have a local or web service convert files to another format before viewing.\n\nOn March 30, 2010 security researcher Didier Stevens reported an Adobe Reader and Foxit Reader exploit that runs a malicious executable if the user allows it to launch when asked.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.pcmag.com/securitywatch/2010/03/malicious_pdfs_execute_code_wi.php|title=Malicious PDFs Execute Code Without a Vulnerability|last=|first=|date=|work=PCMAG|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404034752/http://blogs.pcmag.com/securitywatch/2010/03/malicious_pdfs_execute_code_wi.php|archive-date=4 April 2010|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Content ==\nA PDF file is often a combination of [[vector graphics]], text, and [[bitmap graphics]]. The basic types of content in a PDF are:\n* Text stored as content streams (i.e., not encoded in [[plain text]])\n* Vector graphics for illustrations and designs that consist of shapes and lines\n* Raster graphics for photographs and other types of image\n* Multimedia objects in the document\n\nIn later PDF revisions, a PDF document can also support links (inside document or web page), forms, JavaScript (initially available as plugin for Acrobat 3.0), or any other types of embedded contents that can be handled using plug-ins.\n\nPDF 1.6 supports interactive 3D documents embedded in the PDF \u2013 3D drawings can be embedded using [[U3D]] or [[PRC (file format)|PRC]] and various other data formats.<ref name=\"3d#1\">{{cite web |url=https://www.adobe.com/manufacturing/resources/3dformats/ |title=3D supported formats |publisher=Adobe |date=2009-07-14 |accessdate=2010-02-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212072951/http://www.adobe.com/manufacturing/resources/3dformats/ |archivedate=2010-02-12 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/supported-file-formats-acrobat-reader.html#main_2D_and_3D_formats__Acrobat_9_Pro_Extended__Adobe_3D_Reviewer_|title=Supported file formats in Acrobat and Reader|website=helpx.adobe.com|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/javascript_acrobt_3d.html|title=JavaScript for Acrobat 3D {{!}} Adobe Acrobat Developer Center|website=www.adobe.com|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref>\n\nTwo PDF files that look similar on a computer screen may be of very different sizes. For example, a high-resolution raster image takes more space than a low-resolution one. Typically higher resolution is needed for printing documents than for displaying them on screen. Other things that may increase the size of a file is embedding full fonts, especially for Asiatic scripts, and storing text as graphics.\n\n== Software ==\n{{Main list|List of PDF software}}\n\nPDF viewers are generally provided free of charge, and many versions are available from a variety of sources.\n\nThere are many software options for creating PDFs, including the PDF printing capabilities built into [[macOS]], [[iOS]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iphonehacks.com/2017/10/how-to-create-pdf-web-page-safari-iphone-ipad-ios-11.html|title=How to Create a PDF from Web Page on iPhone and iPad in iOS 11|last=Pathak|first=Khamosh|date=October 7, 2017|website=iPhone Hacks|access-date=February 2, 2018}}</ref> and most [[Linux]] distributions, [[LibreOffice]], [[Microsoft Office 2007]] (if updated to [[Office 2007#Service Pack 2|SP2]]) and later,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/953195|title=Description of 2007 Microsoft Office Suite Service Pack 2 (SP2)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429212434/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/953195|archive-date=29 April 2009|accessdate=2009-05-09}}</ref> [[WordPerfect]] 9, [[Scribus]], numerous PDF print drivers for [[Microsoft Windows]], the [[pdfTeX]] typesetting system, the [[DocBook]] PDF tools, applications developed around [[Ghostscript]] and [[Adobe Acrobat]] itself as well as [[Adobe InDesign]], [[Adobe FrameMaker]], [[Adobe Illustrator]], [[Adobe Photoshop]]. [[Google]]'s online office suite [[Google Docs]] also allows for uploading and saving to PDF.\n\n[[Raster image processor]]s (RIPs) are used to convert PDF files into a [[raster graphics|raster format]] suitable for imaging onto paper and other media in printers, digital production presses and [[prepress]] in a process known as [[rasterisation]]. RIPs capable of processing PDF directly include the Adobe PDF Print Engine<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/products/pdfprintengine/overview.html|title=Adobe PDF Print Engine|work=adobe.com}}</ref> from [[Adobe Systems]] and Jaws<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalgraphics.com/products/jaws_rip/|title=Jaws\u00ae 3.0 PDF and PostScript RIP SDK|work=globalgraphics.com}}</ref> and the [[Harlequin RIP]] from [[Global Graphics]].\n\n=== Conversions ===\nDocuments saved in PDF (Portable Document Format, Portable Document Format for Archiving, Forms Data Format, any printable document) could be [[data conversion|converted]] back and forth from many other formats such as:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pdftron.com/pdf-sdk/supported-file-formats|title=Supported File Formats|publisher=[[PDFTron Systems]]}}</ref>\n* Microsoft Office formats, \n* Rich Text Format, \n* Open office,\n* WordPerfect, \n* Microsoft Windows Bitmap, \n* Windows Metafile,\n* Enhanced Metafile,\n* Graphics Interchange Format,\n* Microsoft HD Photo File,\n* JPEG File Interchange,\n* JPEG 2000 File Format and Code Stream,\n* Portable Network Graphics,\n* Tagged Image File,\n* HyperText Markup Language,\n* MIME Encapsulation of Aggregate HTML Documents,\n* Scalable Vector Graphics,\n* Microsoft Outlook, Text,\n* XML Paper Specification,\n* Extensible Markup Language,\n* Silverlight XPS Document,\n* Extensible Application Markup Language \n\nCompanies such as [[Adobe Acrobat]] provide [[Software development kit|SDK]] libraries for developers to add and create PDF features in any software. Besides the [[Adobe PDF Library]], there are other [[List of PDF software#Development libraries|development libraries]] available.\n\n=== Annotation ===\n{{See also|Comparison of notetaking software}}\n\n[[Adobe Acrobat]] is one example of proprietary software that allows the user to annotate, highlight, and add notes to already created PDF files. One UNIX application available as [[free software]] (under the [[GNU General Public License]]) is [[PDFedit]]. The [[freeware]] [[Foxit Reader]], available for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]] and [[Linux]], allows annotating documents. Tracker Software's [[PDF-XChange Viewer]] allows annotations and markups without restrictions in its freeware alternative. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[macOS]]'s integrated PDF viewer, Preview, does also enable annotations as does the open source software [[Skim (software)|Skim]], with the latter supporting interaction with [[LaTeX]], SyncTeX, and PDFSync and integration with [[BibDesk]] reference management software. Freeware [[Qiqqa]] can create an annotation report that summarizes all the annotations and notes one has made across their library of PDFs. The [[Text Verification Tool]] exports differences in documents as annotations and markups.\n\nThere are also [[web annotation]] systems that support annotation in pdf and other documents formats. In cases where PDFs are expected to have all of the functionality of paper documents, ink annotation is required.\n\n=== Other ===\nExamples of PDF software as online services including [[Scribd]] for viewing and storing, [[Pdfvue]] for online editing, and [[ThinkFree Office|Thinkfree]], [[Zamzar]] for conversion.\n\nIn 1993 the Jaws [[raster image processor]] from [[Global Graphics]] became the first shipping prepress RIP that interpreted PDF natively without conversion to another format. The company released an upgrade to their Harlequin RIP with the same capability in 1997.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.globalgraphics.com/products/harlequin-multi-rip |title=Harlequin MultiRIP|accessdate=2014-03-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209215413/http://www.globalgraphics.com/products/harlequin-multi-rip/|archivedate=2014-02-09 }}</ref>\n\n[[Agfa-Gevaert]] introduced and shipped Apogee, the first prepress workflow system based on PDF, in 1997.\n\nMany commercial offset printers have accepted the submission of press-ready PDF files as a print source, specifically the PDF/X-1a subset and variations of the same.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090205151505/http://www.prepressx.com/ Press-Ready PDF Files] \"For anyone interested in having their graphic project commercially printed directly from digital files or PDFs.\" (last checked on 2009-02-10).</ref> The submission of press-ready PDF files are a replacement for the problematic need for receiving collected native working files.\n\nPDF was selected as the \"native\" [[metafile]] format for [[macOS|Mac OS X]], replacing the [[PICT]] format of the earlier [[classic Mac OS]]. The imaging model of the [[Quartz (graphics layer)|Quartz]] graphics layer is based on the model common to [[Display PostScript]] and PDF, leading to the nickname ''Display PDF''. The Preview application can display PDF files, as can version 2.0 and later of the [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] web browser. System-level support for PDF allows Mac OS X applications to create PDF documents automatically, provided they support the OS-standard printing architecture. The files are then exported in PDF 1.3 format according to the file header.

The [[metre (poetry)|metre]] is [[trochee|trochaic]]. The poem describes the [[Last Judgment]], [[trumpet]] summoning souls before the throne of [[God]], where the saved will be delivered and the unsaved cast into eternal flames.\n\nIt is best known from its use in the [[Requiem]] (Mass for the Dead or Funeral Mass). An English version is found in various [[Anglican Communion]] service books. \n\nThe first melody set to these words, a [[Gregorian chant]], is one of the most quoted in musical literature, appearing in the works of many composers. The final couplet [[Pie Jesu]] has been often reused as an independent song.\n\n==Use in the Roman liturgy==\nThe ''{{Lang|la|Dies irae}}'' has been used in the Roman [[liturgy]] as the sequence for the Requiem Mass for centuries, as made evident by the important place it holds in musical settings such as those by [[Requiem (Mozart)|Mozart]] and [[Requiem (Verdi)|Verdi]]. It appears in the [[Roman Missal]] of 1962, the last edition before the implementation of the revisions that occurred after the Second Vatican Council. As such, it is still heard in churches where the [[Tridentine Mass|Tridentine Latin liturgy]] is celebrated. It also formed part of the traditional liturgy of [[All Souls' Day]].\n\nIn the reforms to the Roman Catholic liturgy ordered by the [[Second Vatican Council]], the \"Consilium for the Implementation of the Constitution on the Liturgy\", the Vatican body charged with drafting and implementing the reforms (1969\u201370), eliminated the sequence as such from funerals and other Masses for the Dead. A leading figure in the [[post-conciliar liturgical reforms]], [[Archbishop]] [[Annibale Bugnini]], explains the rationale of the Consilium:\n{{Quote | They got rid of texts that smacked of a negative spirituality inherited from the [[Middle Ages]]. Thus they removed such familiar and even beloved texts as ''[[Libera me|{{lang|la|Libera me, Domine|nocat=yes}}]]'', ''{{Lang|la|Dies irae}}'', and others that overemphasized judgment, fear, and despair. These they replaced with texts urging Christian hope and arguably giving more effective expression to faith in the [[Resurrection of the dead#Christianity|resurrection]].<ref>{{Citation | first = Annibale | last = Bugnini | title = The Reform of the Liturgy: 1948\u20131975 | publisher = The Liturgical Press | year = 1990 | chapter = 46.II.1 | page = 773}}</ref>}}\n\n''{{Lang|la|Dies irae}}'' remains as a hymn ''[[ad libitum]]'' in the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] during the last week before Advent, divided into three parts for the [[Liturgy of the Hours#Major hours|Office of Readings]], [[Lauds]] and [[Vespers]].<ref name=LHIV>{{Citation | title = Liturgia Horarum | volume = IV | publisher = Vaticana | year = 2000 | page = 489}}</ref>\n\n==Text==\nThe Latin text below is taken from the Requiem Mass in the 1962 [[Roman Missal]].

Amen.\n|}\nBecause the last two stanzas differ markedly in structure from the preceding stanzas, some scholars consider them to be an addition made in order to suit the great poem for liturgical use. The penultimate stanza ''[[Lacrimosa (Requiem)|Lacrimosa]]'' discards the consistent scheme of rhyming triplets in favor of a pair of rhyming couplets. The last stanza ''[[Pie Jesu|Pie Iesu]]'' abandons rhyme for [[assonance]], and, moreover, its lines are [[catalectic]].\n\nIn the liturgical reforms of 1969\u201371, stanza 19 was deleted and the poem divided into three sections: 1\u20136 (for [[Liturgy of the Hours#Major hours|Office of Readings]]), 7\u201312 (for [[Lauds]]) and 13\u201318 (for [[Vespers]]). In addition \"Qui Mariam absolvisti\" in stanza 13 was replaced by \"Peccatricem qui solvisti\" so that that line would now mean, \"You who freed/absolved the sinful woman\". This was because modern scholarship denies the common medieval identification of the [[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery|woman taken in adultery]] with Mary Magdalene, so Mary could no longer be named in this verse.  In addition, a [[doxology]] is given after stanzas 6, 12 and 18:<ref name=LHIV />\n\n{|\n|-\n|O tu, Deus majestatis,<br />alme candor Trinitatis<br />nos conjunge cum beatis. Amen.\n|style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|O God of majesty<br />nourishing light of the Trinity<br />join us with the blessed. Amen.\n|style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|O thou, God of majesty,<br />gracious splendour of the [[Trinity]]<br />conjoin us with the [[Beatific vision|blessed]]. Amen.\n|}\n\n===Manuscript sources===\nThe text of the sequence is found, with slight verbal variations, in a 13th-century manuscript in the Biblioteca Nazionale at Naples. It is a [[Franciscan]] calendar missal that must date between 1253 and 1255 for it does not contain the name of [[Clare of Assisi]], who was canonized in 1255, and whose name would have been inserted if the manuscript were of later date.\n\n=== Inspiration ===\nA major inspiration of the hymn seems to have come from the [[Vulgate]] translation of [[Book of Zephaniah|Zephaniah]] 1:15\u201316:\n{|\n|Dies ir\u00e6, dies illa, dies tribulationis et angusti\u00e6, dies calamitatis et miseri\u00e6, dies tenebrarum et caliginis, dies nebul\u00e6 et turbinis, dies tub\u00e6 et clangoris super civitates munitas et super angulos excelsos.\n|That day is a day of wrath, a day of tribulation and distress, a day of calamity and misery, a day of darkness and obscurity, a day of clouds and whirlwinds, a day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and against the high bulwarks. ([[Douay\u2013Rheims Bible]])\n|}\n\nOther images come from {{bibleref |Revelation|20:11\u201315}} (the book from which the world will be judged), {{bibleref |Matthew|25:31\u201346}} (sheep and goats, right hand, contrast between the blessed and the accursed doomed to flames), {{bibleref |1Thessalonians|4:16}} (trumpet), {{bibleref |2Peter|3:7}} (heaven and earth burnt by fire), {{bibleref |Luke|21:26}} (\"men fainting with fear... they will see the Son of Man coming\"), etc.\n\nFrom the [[Jewish liturgy]], the prayer [[Unetanneh Tokef]] appears to be related: \"We shall ascribe holiness to this day, For it is awesome and terrible\"; \"the great trumpet is sounded\", etc.\n\n=== Other translations ===\nA number of English translations of the poem have been written and proposed for liturgical use. A very loose [[Protestantism|Protestant]] version was made by [[John Newton]]; it opens:\n{{poemquote|Day of judgment! Day of wonders!\nHark! the trumpet's awful sound,\nLouder than a thousand thunders,\nShakes the vast creation round!\nHow the summons will the sinner's heart confound!}}\n\n[[Jan Kasprowicz]], a Polish poet, wrote a hymn entitled \"Dies irae\" which describes the [[Last Judgment|Judgment day]]. The first six lines (two stanzas) follow the original hymn's metre and rhyme structure, and the first stanza translates to \"The trumpet will cast a wondrous sound\".\n\nThe American writer [[Ambrose Bierce]] published a satiric version of the poem in his 1903 book ''Shapes of Clay'', preserving the original metre but using humorous and sardonic language; for example, the second verse is rendered:\n{{poemquote|Ah! what terror shall be shaping\nWhen the Judge the truth's undraping&nbsp;\u2013\nCats from every bag escaping!}}\n\nRev.

The [[metre (poetry)|metre]] is [[trochee|trochaic]]. The poem describes the [[Last Judgment]], [[trumpet]] summoning souls before the throne of [[God]], where the saved will be delivered and the unsaved cast into eternal flames.\n\nIt is best known from its use in the [[Requiem]] (Mass for the Dead or Funeral Mass). An English version is found in various [[Anglican Communion]] service books. \n\nThe first melody set to these words, a [[Gregorian chant]], is one of the most quoted in musical literature, appearing in the works of many composers. The final couplet [[Pie Jesu]] has been often reused as an independent song.\n\n==Use in the Roman liturgy==\nThe ''{{Lang|la|Dies irae}}'' has been used in the Roman [[liturgy]] as the sequence for the Requiem Mass for centuries, as made evident by the important place it holds in musical settings such as those by [[Requiem (Mozart)|Mozart]] and [[Requiem (Verdi)|Verdi]]. It appears in the [[Roman Missal]] of 1962, the last edition before the implementation of the revisions that occurred after the Second Vatican Council. As such, it is still heard in churches where the [[Tridentine Mass|Tridentine Latin liturgy]] is celebrated. It also formed part of the traditional liturgy of [[All Souls' Day]].\n\nIn the reforms to the Roman Catholic liturgy ordered by the [[Second Vatican Council]], the \"Consilium for the Implementation of the Constitution on the Liturgy\", the Vatican body charged with drafting and implementing the reforms (1969\u201370), eliminated the sequence as such from funerals and other Masses for the Dead. A leading figure in the [[post-conciliar liturgical reforms]], [[Archbishop]] [[Annibale Bugnini]], explains the rationale of the Consilium:\n{{Quote | They got rid of texts that smacked of a negative spirituality inherited from the [[Middle Ages]]. Thus they removed such familiar and even beloved texts as ''[[Libera me|{{lang|la|Libera me, Domine|nocat=yes}}]]'', ''{{Lang|la|Dies irae}}'', and others that overemphasized judgment, fear, and despair.

Amen.\n|}\nBecause the last two stanzas differ markedly in structure from the preceding stanzas, some scholars consider them to be an addition made in order to suit the great poem for liturgical use. The penultimate stanza ''[[Lacrimosa (Requiem)|Lacrimosa]]'' discards the consistent scheme of rhyming triplets in favor of a pair of rhyming couplets. The last stanza ''[[Pie Jesu|Pie Iesu]]'' abandons rhyme for [[assonance]], and, moreover, its lines are [[catalectic]].\n\nIn the liturgical reforms of 1969\u201371, stanza 19 was deleted and the poem divided into three sections: 1\u20136 (for [[Liturgy of the Hours#Major hours|Office of Readings]]), 7\u201312 (for [[Lauds]]) and 13\u201318 (for [[Vespers]]). In addition \"Qui Mariam absolvisti\" in stanza 13 was replaced by \"Peccatricem qui solvisti\" so that that line would now mean, \"You who freed/absolved the sinful woman\". This was because modern scholarship denies the common medieval identification of the [[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery|woman taken in adultery]] with Mary Magdalene, so Mary could no longer be named in this verse.  In addition, a [[doxology]] is given after stanzas 6, 12 and 18:<ref name=LHIV />\n\n{|\n|-\n|O tu, Deus majestatis,<br />alme candor Trinitatis<br />nos conjunge cum beatis. Amen.\n|style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|O God of majesty<br />nourishing light of the Trinity<br />join us with the blessed. Amen.\n|style=\"padding-left:2em;\"|O thou, God of majesty,<br />gracious splendour of the [[Trinity]]<br />conjoin us with the [[Beatific vision|blessed]]. Amen.\n|}\n\n===Manuscript sources===\nThe text of the sequence is found, with slight verbal variations, in a 13th-century manuscript in the Biblioteca Nazionale at Naples. It is a [[Franciscan]] calendar missal that must date between 1253 and 1255 for it does not contain the name of [[Clare of Assisi]], who was canonized in 1255, and whose name would have been inserted if the manuscript were of later date.\n\n=== Inspiration ===\nA major inspiration of the hymn seems to have come from the [[Vulgate]] translation of [[Book of Zephaniah|Zephaniah]] 1:15\u201316:\n{|\n|Dies ir\u00e6, dies illa, dies tribulationis et angusti\u00e6, dies calamitatis et miseri\u00e6, dies tenebrarum et caliginis, dies nebul\u00e6 et turbinis, dies tub\u00e6 et clangoris super civitates munitas et super angulos excelsos.\n|That day is a day of wrath, a day of tribulation and distress, a day of calamity and misery, a day of darkness and obscurity, a day of clouds and whirlwinds, a day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and against the high bulwarks. ([[Douay\u2013Rheims Bible]])\n|}\n\nOther images come from {{bibleref |Revelation|20:11\u201315}} (the book from which the world will be judged), {{bibleref |Matthew|25:31\u201346}} (sheep and goats, right hand, contrast between the blessed and the accursed doomed to flames), {{bibleref |1Thessalonians|4:16}} (trumpet), {{bibleref |2Peter|3:7}} (heaven and earth burnt by fire), {{bibleref |Luke|21:26}} (\"men fainting with fear... they will see the Son of Man coming\"), etc.\n\nFrom the [[Jewish liturgy]], the prayer [[Unetanneh Tokef]] appears to be related: \"We shall ascribe holiness to this day, For it is awesome and terrible\"; \"the great trumpet is sounded\", etc.\n\n=== Other translations ===\nA number of English translations of the poem have been written and proposed for liturgical use. A very loose [[Protestantism|Protestant]] version was made by [[John Newton]]; it opens:\n{{poemquote|Day of judgment! Day of wonders!\nHark! the trumpet's awful sound,\nLouder than a thousand thunders,\nShakes the vast creation round!\nHow the summons will the sinner's heart confound!}}\n\n[[Jan Kasprowicz]], a Polish poet, wrote a hymn entitled \"Dies irae\" which describes the [[Last Judgment|Judgment day]]. The first six lines (two stanzas) follow the original hymn's metre and rhyme structure, and the first stanza translates to \"The trumpet will cast a wondrous sound\".\n\nThe American writer [[Ambrose Bierce]] published a satiric version of the poem in his 1903 book ''Shapes of Clay'', preserving the original metre but using humorous and sardonic language; for example, the second verse is rendered:\n{{poemquote|Ah! what terror shall be shaping\nWhen the Judge the truth's undraping&nbsp;\u2013\nCats from every bag escaping!}}\n\nRev. Bernard Callan (1750\u20131804), an Irish priest and poet, translated it into Gaelic around 1800.

Dick]] and [[Roger Zelazny]]. The English translation is used verbatim in Dick's novel [[Ubik]] two years later.\n\n==Music==\n{{See also|Music for the Requiem Mass}}\n\n===Musical settings===\n<!--Note that the audio file uses classical latin pronunciation, which is slightly different from ecclesial Latin when a \"c\" or a \"g\" precede an \"i\" or an \"e\"-->\n{{Listen |type=music|filename=Dies.irae.ogg|title=Dies Irae (plainchant)}}\n\nThe words of ''{{Lang|la|Dies irae}}'' have often been set to music as part of the [[Requiem]] service.

The first polyphonic settings to include the ''{{Lang|la|Dies irae}}'' are by [[Engarandus Juvenis]] (c. 1490) and [[Antoine Brumel]] (1516) to be followed by many composers of the renaissance. Later, many notable choral and orchestral settings of the Requiem including the sequence were made by composers such as [[Requiem (Mozart)|Mozart]], [[Requiem (Berlioz)|Berlioz]], [[Requiem (Verdi)|Verdi]], and [[Requiem Canticles|Stravinsky]].\n\n===Musical quotations===\nThe traditional Gregorian melody has been used as a [[theme (music)|theme]] or [[musical quotation]] in many classical compositions, film scores, and popular works, including:\n<!-- Note this section is for notable classical compositions only.

Macdonald]] created a chair in architecture at McGill which was led by [[Stewart Henbest Capper]], a former student at the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris. Macdonald also provided funds for the initial expenses of equipment, as well as an annual endowment for their maintenance. At this time, the School had two architecture studios which occupied two rooms in the northern half of the top floor of the old Macdonald Engineering Building. The School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation, and as it remains today, the first year was preparatory, with all courses taken jointly by architecture and engineering students. The first graduating class was composed of only three students,{{NoteTag|The first graduating class was composed of George Taylor Hyde, Norman M.

By 1906, he was teaching six classes, so he hired three new staff to assist him, including his former colleague [[Cecil Burgess]]. Nobbs believed students should be exposed to architecture in practice, and one year after his arrival in Montreal, he designed the McGill Union (today the [[McCord Museum]]) across from McGill's [[Roddick Gates]]. After the Macdonald Engineering Building was damaged by fire in 1907,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cac.mcgill.ca/campus/buildings/Macdonald_Engineering.html|title=Macdonald Engineering, the Workman Wing, & the Electrical Wing|publisher=Canadian Architecture Collection|accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> Nobbs designed the new building in its place, and the School of Architecture moved to its ground floor.

Macdonald also provided funds for the initial expenses of equipment, as well as an annual endowment for their maintenance. At this time, the School had two architecture studios which occupied two rooms in the northern half of the top floor of the old Macdonald Engineering Building. The School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation, and as it remains today, the first year was preparatory, with all courses taken jointly by architecture and engineering students. The first graduating class was composed of only three students,{{NoteTag|The first graduating class was composed of George Taylor Hyde, Norman M.

By 1906, he was teaching six classes, so he hired three new staff to assist him, including his former colleague [[Cecil Burgess]]. Nobbs believed students should be exposed to architecture in practice, and one year after his arrival in Montreal, he designed the McGill Union (today the [[McCord Museum]]) across from McGill's [[Roddick Gates]].

In 1945, a new five-year program was adopted for the next two decades. After the [[World War Two|Second World War]], the School of Architecture increased its staff and doubled its physical accommodation due to the surge in university enrollment.

In India, the figure for deaths due to AIDS stood at 170,000 in 2009. The report says India has contributed enormously to the AIDS response. \"With 80 per cent of these drugs being generics purchased in India, several billion dollars have been saved over the past five years. The country is also committed to new forms of partnership with low-income countries through innovative support mechanisms and South Asia cooperation\" the UNAIDS report says. It also points out that India already provides substantial support to neighbouring countries and other Asian countries \u2013 in 2011, it allocated [[USD]] 430 million to 68 projects in [[Bhutan]] across key socio-economic sectors, including health, education and capacity-building. In 2011 at Addis Ababa, the [[Government of India]] further committed to accelerating technology transfer between its [[pharmaceutical]] sector and African manufacturers.\n\nThe National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has increased the number of centres providing free Antiretroviral Treatment (ART) from 54 to 91 centres with another 9 more centres also getting operational soon{{when|date=June 2019}}. At these 91 centres medicines for treating 8,500 patients have been made available. All the 91 centres have specially appointed and trained doctors, counsellors and laboratory technicians to help initiate patients on ART and follow them up regularly. The ART is a combination of three potent drugs, which is being given to the persons with advanced stage of AIDS. Although these drugs do not cure HIV infection, they suppress multiplication of the virus and reduce the number of opportunistic infections thereby improving the quality of life and prolonging the life span. Apart from providing free treatment, all the ART centres are providing counselling to the infected persons so that they maintain regularity of their medication. Continuity is the most important factor for the long term effectiveness of the ART drugs as disruption can lead to drug resistance.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} At present 40,000 are on ART, which are expected to go up to 85,000 by March end.{{when|date=June 2019}} All these centres have a plan to ensure that patients take their medicines regularly and are followed up, in case of default, while maintaining their confidentiality.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nResponding to a petition made by NGO's, in December 2010, the [[Supreme Court of India]] directed Indian government to provide second-line [[Antiretroviral drug|Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)]] to all AIDS patients in the country, by warning the government against abdicating its constitutional duty of providing treatment to HIV positive patients on grounds of financial constraint, as it was issue of the [[right to life]] guaranteed under Article 21 of the [[Indian Constitution]]. Previously in an affidavit before the Supreme Court, NACO had said second-line ART treatment for HIV patients, costing Rs28,500 each, could not be extended to those who had received \"irrational treatment\" by private medical practitioners for the first round, which costs around Rs 6,500. The court rejected both the arguments of financial constraints and only 10 [[viral load]] testing centres needed for test patients for migrating from first line of treatment to the second line being are available, raised by the [[Solicitor General of India|Solicitor General]] representing the government. The court further asked the government to give a clear-cut and \"workable\" solution response within a week's time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-12-11/india/28231314_1_hiv-patients-second-line-treatment-second-line-drugs|title=SC forces govt to agree to second-line ART to all AIDS patients|date=11 Dec 2010|work=The Times of India}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/SC-cautions-govt-over-HIV-treatment/Article1-636976.aspx|title=SC cautions govt over HIV treatment|date=11 December 2010|work=Hindustan Times}}</ref>\n\n=== Funding ===\n{{See also|Cost of HIV treatment}}\n\nHIV spending increased in India from 2003 to 2007, and fell by 15% in 2008 to 2009.

Specifically, the [[mental health]] of AIDS orphans in India is shown to be poor as compared to children who were orphaned by other factors.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBefore becoming orphans, children whose parents suffer from AIDS face many obstacles. There is \"tremendous emotional trauma\" associated with having a parent ill with HIV, and the child often worries about resource scarcity, being separated from siblings, and grief of the impending death of the parent.<ref name=\":6\" /> While the parent is ill, the child experiences long periods of uncertainty and episodic crises, which decreases the child's sense of security and stability.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Children orphaned by AIDS : front-line responses from eastern and southern Africa|date=1999|publisher=UNICEF|oclc=59176094}}</ref>\n\nA study done in orphanages in Hyderabad, India showed that orphans in India who have lost one or both parents to AIDS are 1.3 times as likely to be clinically depressed than children orphaned due to other reasons.<ref name=\":0\" /> The study used The [[Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale]] (CES-DC) to measure depression in children orphaned by AIDS and children orphaned by other reasons. The mean depression score for AIDS orphans was 34.6, while that of other orphans was 20.6. When questioned, 58.3% of AIDS orphans answered \u201cI felt like crying\u201d a lot as compared to 20.8% of children orphaned by other reasons. 60.3% of AIDS orphans also answered \u201cI felt sad\u201d a lot, while only 20.8% of children orphaned by other reasons answered the same level. In addition, the study showed that the bulk of the depression score was concentrated among children of younger ages for AIDS orphans, while in other orphans it was mostly seen in older children. A distinction was also made between genders; girls orphaned due to AIDS had a higher rate of depression than boys.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nStudies also show that the likelihood of post traumatic stress disorder is common among AIDS orphans. In a study done in South Africa of the mental health of 60 orphans, 73% of the HIV orphans were shown to have PTSD.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Lata|first=Swaran|date=October 2013|title=Mental health of HIV/AIDS orphans: A review|url=|journal=Journal of AIDS and HIV Research|volume=5|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nAnother study done on mental health of different AIDS orphans around the world showed more behavioral problems later in life as compared to other vulnerable children.<ref name=\":3\" /> For example, AIDS orphans were more likely to smoke, be engaged in crime, and drink alcohol.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nWhile further studies about mental health in AIDS orphans in India is limited, a study done in South Africa showed that AIDS orphans viewed themselves as having \"no good friends\" than non-orphans.<ref name=\":3\" /> However, they were less likely to have anger problems. The orphans in this study also showed more frequency of nightmares.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==== Education ====\nBecause AIDS OVC often have many family members either deceased or ill, these orphans are often forced into taking jobs at a young age in order to provide for the rest of their family, resulting in lower attendance at school or being forced to drop out from school completely. For example, orphans that have lost their father due to AIDS are forced to take on field or manual labor jobs, which may be high risk occupations. Orphans that have lost their mothers take on housework and childcare. Girls are more often taken out of school to help with domestic work and care for sick parents.<ref name=\":10\" /> Studies show that 17% of children with HIV-infected parents took on a job to assist with household income.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe cost of treatment for HIV is so high that many families often do not have the means to pay for care or education of the child.<ref name=\":8\" /> If a child is forced to drop out of school in order to take on additional responsibility at home due to the illness of his parent, the child is named a \u201cde-facto\u201d orphan.<ref name=\":02\" />&nbsp; There has been no correlation found between gender and risk of poor educational outcomes or risk of dropping out of school.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Sinha|first=Aakanksha|last2=Lombe|first2=Margaret|last3=Saltzman|first3=Leia Y.|last4=Whetten|first4=Kathryn|last5=Whetten|first5=Rachel|date=March 2016|title=Exploring Factors Associated with Educational Outcomes for Orphan and Abandoned Children in India |journal=Global Social Welfare |volume=3|issue=1|pages=23\u201332|doi=10.1007/s40609-016-0043-7|issn=2196-8799|pmc=4830269|pmid=27088068}}</ref> Because of stigma, many AIDS orphans are expelled from school.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nIn a study on education of orphans in India, the caretaker's health was found to be very important in determining if the orphan was at a target educational standard.<ref name=\":1\" /> When a primary caregiver was in poor health, the odds of the orphan being in the target grade level decreased by 54%.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe prevalence of AIDS orphans around the world has been shown to be a threat to economic development in many countries.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite web|last=Salaam|first=Tiaji|title=AIDS Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC): Problems, Responses, and Issues for Congress|publisher=Congressional Research Service|date=February 11, 2005|url=http://ovcsupport.org/wp-content/uploads/Documents/AIDS_Orphans_and_Vulnerable_Children_OVC_Problems_Responses_and_Issues_for_Congress_1.pdf }}</ref> Because AIDS orphans have a lower chance of completing primary and secondary education, they have a lower chance of entering professions that depend on education level and professional training.

In India, the figure for deaths due to AIDS stood at 170,000 in 2009. The report says India has contributed enormously to the AIDS response. \"With 80 per cent of these drugs being generics purchased in India, several billion dollars have been saved over the past five years. The country is also committed to new forms of partnership with low-income countries through innovative support mechanisms and South Asia cooperation\" the UNAIDS report says. It also points out that India already provides substantial support to neighbouring countries and other Asian countries \u2013 in 2011, it allocated [[USD]] 430 million to 68 projects in [[Bhutan]] across key socio-economic sectors, including health, education and capacity-building. In 2011 at Addis Ababa, the [[Government of India]] further committed to accelerating technology transfer between its [[pharmaceutical]] sector and African manufacturers.\n\nThe National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has increased the number of centres providing free Antiretroviral Treatment (ART) from 54 to 91 centres with another 9 more centres also getting operational soon{{when|date=June 2019}}. At these 91 centres medicines for treating 8,500 patients have been made available. All the 91 centres have specially appointed and trained doctors, counsellors and laboratory technicians to help initiate patients on ART and follow them up regularly. The ART is a combination of three potent drugs, which is being given to the persons with advanced stage of AIDS. Although these drugs do not cure HIV infection, they suppress multiplication of the virus and reduce the number of opportunistic infections thereby improving the quality of life and prolonging the life span. Apart from providing free treatment, all the ART centres are providing counselling to the infected persons so that they maintain regularity of their medication. Continuity is the most important factor for the long term effectiveness of the ART drugs as disruption can lead to drug resistance.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} At present 40,000 are on ART, which are expected to go up to 85,000 by March end.{{when|date=June 2019}} All these centres have a plan to ensure that patients take their medicines regularly and are followed up, in case of default, while maintaining their confidentiality.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nResponding to a petition made by NGO's, in December 2010, the [[Supreme Court of India]] directed Indian government to provide second-line [[Antiretroviral drug|Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)]] to all AIDS patients in the country, by warning the government against abdicating its constitutional duty of providing treatment to HIV positive patients on grounds of financial constraint, as it was issue of the [[right to life]] guaranteed under Article 21 of the [[Indian Constitution]]. Previously in an affidavit before the Supreme Court, NACO had said second-line ART treatment for HIV patients, costing Rs28,500 each, could not be extended to those who had received \"irrational treatment\" by private medical practitioners for the first round, which costs around Rs 6,500. The court rejected both the arguments of financial constraints and only 10 [[viral load]] testing centres needed for test patients for migrating from first line of treatment to the second line being are available, raised by the [[Solicitor General of India|Solicitor General]] representing the government.

Specifically, the [[mental health]] of AIDS orphans in India is shown to be poor as compared to children who were orphaned by other factors.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBefore becoming orphans, children whose parents suffer from AIDS face many obstacles. There is \"tremendous emotional trauma\" associated with having a parent ill with HIV, and the child often worries about resource scarcity, being separated from siblings, and grief of the impending death of the parent.<ref name=\":6\" /> While the parent is ill, the child experiences long periods of uncertainty and episodic crises, which decreases the child's sense of security and stability.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Children orphaned by AIDS : front-line responses from eastern and southern Africa|date=1999|publisher=UNICEF|oclc=59176094}}</ref>\n\nA study done in orphanages in Hyderabad, India showed that orphans in India who have lost one or both parents to AIDS are 1.3 times as likely to be clinically depressed than children orphaned due to other reasons.<ref name=\":0\" /> The study used The [[Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale]] (CES-DC) to measure depression in children orphaned by AIDS and children orphaned by other reasons. The mean depression score for AIDS orphans was 34.6, while that of other orphans was 20.6. When questioned, 58.3% of AIDS orphans answered \u201cI felt like crying\u201d a lot as compared to 20.8% of children orphaned by other reasons. 60.3% of AIDS orphans also answered \u201cI felt sad\u201d a lot, while only 20.8% of children orphaned by other reasons answered the same level. In addition, the study showed that the bulk of the depression score was concentrated among children of younger ages for AIDS orphans, while in other orphans it was mostly seen in older children. A distinction was also made between genders; girls orphaned due to AIDS had a higher rate of depression than boys.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nStudies also show that the likelihood of post traumatic stress disorder is common among AIDS orphans. In a study done in South Africa of the mental health of 60 orphans, 73% of the HIV orphans were shown to have PTSD.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Lata|first=Swaran|date=October 2013|title=Mental health of HIV/AIDS orphans: A review|url=|journal=Journal of AIDS and HIV Research|volume=5|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nAnother study done on mental health of different AIDS orphans around the world showed more behavioral problems later in life as compared to other vulnerable children.<ref name=\":3\" /> For example, AIDS orphans were more likely to smoke, be engaged in crime, and drink alcohol.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nWhile further studies about mental health in AIDS orphans in India is limited, a study done in South Africa showed that AIDS orphans viewed themselves as having \"no good friends\" than non-orphans.<ref name=\":3\" /> However, they were less likely to have anger problems. The orphans in this study also showed more frequency of nightmares.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==== Education ====\nBecause AIDS OVC often have many family members either deceased or ill, these orphans are often forced into taking jobs at a young age in order to provide for the rest of their family, resulting in lower attendance at school or being forced to drop out from school completely. For example, orphans that have lost their father due to AIDS are forced to take on field or manual labor jobs, which may be high risk occupations. Orphans that have lost their mothers take on housework and childcare. Girls are more often taken out of school to help with domestic work and care for sick parents.<ref name=\":10\" /> Studies show that 17% of children with HIV-infected parents took on a job to assist with household income.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe cost of treatment for HIV is so high that many families often do not have the means to pay for care or education of the child.<ref name=\":8\" /> If a child is forced to drop out of school in order to take on additional responsibility at home due to the illness of his parent, the child is named a \u201cde-facto\u201d orphan.<ref name=\":02\" />&nbsp; There has been no correlation found between gender and risk of poor educational outcomes or risk of dropping out of school.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Sinha|first=Aakanksha|last2=Lombe|first2=Margaret|last3=Saltzman|first3=Leia Y.|last4=Whetten|first4=Kathryn|last5=Whetten|first5=Rachel|date=March 2016|title=Exploring Factors Associated with Educational Outcomes for Orphan and Abandoned Children in India |journal=Global Social Welfare |volume=3|issue=1|pages=23\u201332|doi=10.1007/s40609-016-0043-7|issn=2196-8799|pmc=4830269|pmid=27088068}}</ref> Because of stigma, many AIDS orphans are expelled from school.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nIn a study on education of orphans in India, the caretaker's health was found to be very important in determining if the orphan was at a target educational standard.<ref name=\":1\" /> When a primary caregiver was in poor health, the odds of the orphan being in the target grade level decreased by 54%.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe prevalence of AIDS orphans around the world has been shown to be a threat to economic development in many countries.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite web|last=Salaam|first=Tiaji|title=AIDS Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC): Problems, Responses, and Issues for Congress|publisher=Congressional Research Service|date=February 11, 2005|url=http://ovcsupport.org/wp-content/uploads/Documents/AIDS_Orphans_and_Vulnerable_Children_OVC_Problems_Responses_and_Issues_for_Congress_1.pdf }}</ref> Because AIDS orphans have a lower chance of completing primary and secondary education, they have a lower chance of entering professions that depend on education level and professional training. These orphans will be more at risk to grow up and engage in high-risk behaviours, resulting in more chance of HIV transmission. Therefore, countries may face a cycle of national poverty and low economic development due to the prevalence of AIDS orphans.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==== Responses ====\nWhile much research has gone into community programming for AIDS orphans, only a few efforts focus on saving the lives of the HIV-infected parents themselves.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Beckerman|first=Karen Palmore|date=2002-04-06|title=Mothers, orphans, and prevention of paediatric AIDS |journal=The Lancet|language=English|volume=359|issue=9313|pages=1168\u20131169|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08248-X |pmid=11955530}}</ref>\n\nWhen comparing institution based care verses community based care, studies have shown that there is less discrimination in the former.<ref name=\":7\" /> However, the government of India has used institutionalizing orphans as the norm, and have not fully explored other options like fostering or community based care for AIDS orphans.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nIndia pledged to provide better resources for AIDS orphans at the UN General Assembly Special Session on HIV/ AIDS in 2001.<ref name=\":4\" /> In 2007, India was the first country in South Asia to create a national response to children affected by AIDS.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/aids/files/NPA_Review_Final__13_August_.pdf|title=National responses for children affected by AIDS: Review of progress and lessons learned|last=Ackerman Gulaid|first=Laurie|date=|website=Unicef|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref> India created the Policy Framework For Children, which acknowledges the goal of providing the resources for at least 80% of children affected by HIV/AIDS.
