The three major battles fought near the city in [[First Battle of Panipat|1526]], [[Second Battle of Panipat|1556]] and [[Third Battle of Panipat|1761]] were all turning points in [[Indian history]]. The city is famous in India as the \"City of Weavers\" and \"Textile City\".

On 24 July 1991 it was again merged with Karnal district. On 1 January 1992, it again became a separate district. According to the legend, Panipat was one of the five cities (prasthas) founded by the [[Pandava]] brothers during the times of the [[Mahabharata]]; its historic name was ''Pandavaprastha'' ([[Sanskrit]]: \u092a\u093e\u0923\u094d\u0921\u0935\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u094d\u0925, lit. ''city of Pandavas'') Panipat was the scene of three pivotal battles in Indian history. Panipat is first recorded in the Mahabharata as one of the five villages that the Pandavas demanded from Duryodhana. The five villages are the \"panch pat\":\n* Panaprastha (now known as Panipat)\n* Suvarnaprastha (now known as [[Sonipat]])\n* Indraprastha (now known as [[Delhi]])\n* Vyaghraprastha became Baghpat (now known as [[Baghpat]])\n* Tilaprastha (now known as [[Tilpat]])\n\nThe [[First Battle of Panipat]] was fought on 21 April 1526 between [[Ibrahim Lodhi]], the Afghan [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultan of Delhi]], and the [[Turko-Mongol]] warlord [[Babur]], who later established [[Mughal Empire|Mughal rule]] in Northern Indian subcontinent. Babur's force defeated Ibrahim's much larger force of over one lakh (one hundred thousand) soldiers. This first battle of Panipat thus ended the 'Lodi Rule' established by Bahlul Lodhi in Delhi.\n\nThe [[Second Battle of Panipat]] was fought on 5 November 1556 between the forces of  [[Akbar]] and [[Hem Chandra Vikramaditya]], a Hindu King of Delhi.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HHyVh29gy4QC&pg=PA13 |title=The Mughal Empire |series=The New Cambridge History of India |editor-first=John F. |editor-last=Richards |edition=7th |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1995 |origyear=1993 |isbn=9780521566032 |page=13 |accessdate=2013-05-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SrdiVPsFRYIC&pg=PA163 |title=Naukar, Rajput, and Sepoy: The Ethnohistory of the Military Labour Market of Hindustan, 1450-1850 |first=Dirk H.

On not seeing him in his howdah on the back of an elephant, his army fled. Dead Hemu was carried to Akbar's camp where Bairam Khan beheaded him <ref>Abdul Quadir Badayuni, Muntkhib-ul-Tawarikh, Volume 1, page 6</ref> His head was sent to [[Kabul]] to be hanged outside Delhi Darwaza, and his torso was hanged outside Purana Quila in Delhi. The place of martyrdom of Raja Hemu is now a famous shrine in Panipat.\n\nThe [[Third Battle of Panipat]] was fought on 14 January 1761 between the [[Maratha Empire]] and the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] and [[Baloch people|Baloch]] invaders. The Maratha Empire was led by Sadashivrao Bhau Peshwa with Dattaji shinde Dattaji and the Afghans were led by Ahmadshah Abdali. The Afghans had a total strength of 110,000 soldiers, and the Marathas had 75,000 soldiers and 100,000 pilgrims. The Maratha soldiers were unable to get food because of non-cooperation of other empires of India. Both the sides fought their heart out. The Afghans were supported by [[Najib-ud-Daula]] and [[Shuja-ud-Daula]] for the supply of food, and the Maratha had pilgrims along with them, who were unable to fight, including female pilgrims. On 14 January, over 100,000 soldiers died resulting in the victory for the Afghans. However, after  the victory, the Afghans facing a hostile North India, retreated to Afghanistan to avoid casualties. This battle served as a precursor for [[British Empire]] to establish [[Company rule in India]] as most of North and Northwest Indian princely states were weakened.<ref>[https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/gk-current-affairs/story/the-third-battle-of-panipat-954941-2017-01-14 The third battle of Panipat]</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nPanipat is located at {{Coord|29.39|N|76.97|E|}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/10/Panipat.html|title=Maps, Weather, and Airports for Panipat, India|website=www.fallingrain.com}}</ref> It has an average elevation of 219&nbsp;metres (718&nbsp;[[foot (length)|feet]]).\n\n==Demographics==\n<!-- There is a separate article for the district, so statistics should be for the city only!! -->\n\nAs per 2011 census, the city had a population of 294,292.<ref name=\"census2011\">{{cite web|title=Panipat City Population Census 2011|url=http://www.census2011.co.in/census/city/37-panipat.html|website=www.census2011.co.in}}</ref> Panipat's urban agglomeration had a population of 295,970.

It is 90&nbsp;km north of [[Delhi]] and 169&nbsp;km south of [[Chandigarh]] on [[List of National Highways in India|NH]]-1. The three major battles fought near the city in [[First Battle of Panipat|1526]], [[Second Battle of Panipat|1556]] and [[Third Battle of Panipat|1761]] were all turning points in [[Indian history]]. The city is famous in India as the \"City of Weavers\" and \"Textile City\". It is also known as the \"cast-off capital\" due to being \"the global centre for recycling textiles\".<ref name=\"vecono\" >{{cite news|author=|title=Panipat, the global centre for recycling textiles, is fading|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21728661-industrys-decline-missed-opportunity-india-panipat-global-centre-recycling|work=[[The Economist]]|date=7 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Statue of Hem Chandra Vikramaditya at Panipat.JPG|thumb|right|Statue of the Hindu Emperor of Delhi in 1556 [[Hemu|Hem Chandra Vikramaditya]], at Panipat, who lost his life in the [[Second Battle of Panipat]]]]\n{{Main|Battle of Panipat (1526)|Battle of Panipat (1556)|Battle of Panipat (1761)}}\nPanipat district was carved out from the erstwhile Karnal district on 1 November 1989. On 24 July 1991 it was again merged with Karnal district. On 1 January 1992, it again became a separate district. According to the legend, Panipat was one of the five cities (prasthas) founded by the [[Pandava]] brothers during the times of the [[Mahabharata]]; its historic name was ''Pandavaprastha'' ([[Sanskrit]]: \u092a\u093e\u0923\u094d\u0921\u0935\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u094d\u0925, lit. ''city of Pandavas'') Panipat was the scene of three pivotal battles in Indian history. Panipat is first recorded in the Mahabharata as one of the five villages that the Pandavas demanded from Duryodhana. The five villages are the \"panch pat\":\n* Panaprastha (now known as Panipat)\n* Suvarnaprastha (now known as [[Sonipat]])\n* Indraprastha (now known as [[Delhi]])\n* Vyaghraprastha became Baghpat (now known as [[Baghpat]])\n* Tilaprastha (now known as [[Tilpat]])\n\nThe [[First Battle of Panipat]] was fought on 21 April 1526 between [[Ibrahim Lodhi]], the Afghan [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultan of Delhi]], and the [[Turko-Mongol]] warlord [[Babur]], who later established [[Mughal Empire|Mughal rule]] in Northern Indian subcontinent. Babur's force defeated Ibrahim's much larger force of over one lakh (one hundred thousand) soldiers. This first battle of Panipat thus ended the 'Lodi Rule' established by Bahlul Lodhi in Delhi.\n\nThe [[Second Battle of Panipat]] was fought on 5 November 1556 between the forces of  [[Akbar]] and [[Hem Chandra Vikramaditya]], a Hindu King of Delhi.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HHyVh29gy4QC&pg=PA13 |title=The Mughal Empire |series=The New Cambridge History of India |editor-first=John F. |editor-last=Richards |edition=7th |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1995 |origyear=1993 |isbn=9780521566032 |page=13 |accessdate=2013-05-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SrdiVPsFRYIC&pg=PA163 |title=Naukar, Rajput, and Sepoy: The Ethnohistory of the Military Labour Market of Hindustan, 1450-1850 |first=Dirk H.

The Maratha Empire was led by Sadashivrao Bhau Peshwa with Dattaji shinde Dattaji and the Afghans were led by Ahmadshah Abdali. The Afghans had a total strength of 110,000 soldiers, and the Marathas had 75,000 soldiers and 100,000 pilgrims. The Maratha soldiers were unable to get food because of non-cooperation of other empires of India. Both the sides fought their heart out. The Afghans were supported by [[Najib-ud-Daula]] and [[Shuja-ud-Daula]] for the supply of food, and the Maratha had pilgrims along with them, who were unable to fight, including female pilgrims. On 14 January, over 100,000 soldiers died resulting in the victory for the Afghans. However, after  the victory, the Afghans facing a hostile North India, retreated to Afghanistan to avoid casualties. This battle served as a precursor for [[British Empire]] to establish [[Company rule in India]] as most of North and Northwest Indian princely states were weakened.<ref>[https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/gk-current-affairs/story/the-third-battle-of-panipat-954941-2017-01-14 The third battle of Panipat]</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nPanipat is located at {{Coord|29.39|N|76.97|E|}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/10/Panipat.html|title=Maps, Weather, and Airports for Panipat, India|website=www.fallingrain.com}}</ref> It has an average elevation of 219&nbsp;metres (718&nbsp;[[foot (length)|feet]]).\n\n==Demographics==\n<!-- There is a separate article for the district, so statistics should be for the city only!! -->\n\nAs per 2011 census, the city had a population of 294,292.<ref name=\"census2011\">{{cite web|title=Panipat City Population Census 2011|url=http://www.census2011.co.in/census/city/37-panipat.html|website=www.census2011.co.in}}</ref> Panipat's urban agglomeration had a population of 295,970.

It took place between 10 August and 5 September 1643, between the defending Parliamentarian garrison of [[Gloucester]] and the besieging army of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. The siege ended with the arrival of a relieving Parliamentarian army under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]. The Royalist forces withdrew, having sustained heavy casualties and had several cannons disabled as a result of sallies made by the defenders.\n\n==Prelude==\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, seized Bristol. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201355</ref> On 6 August the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused to surrender the city, but in a secret communication he let it be known that he would do so if the King, rather than Rupert, led the army on Gloucester. Charles decided the next day that this was the best chance of securing Gloucester quickly and without bloodshed. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 55\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined [[Gloucester Castle|castle]] by the river and a stretch of wall that linked the south, east and original north fates, the last known as the inner north gate and now well within the city, still survived. From the south gate to the east gate the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe fall of Bristol prompted the hurried reinforcement of the existing defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from the south gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to the outer north gate. From there the River Twyver formed a moat as the earthwork followed it north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This easternmost channel of the River Severn had dried up by the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988 para. 2</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west to a point a short distance north of Westgate Street, from where it was extended the other side of the Old Severn to the River Severn just above the west gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at the inner north gate via [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The outer north gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline. The Town Regiment lacked experience but was motivated by its ties to the city it was defending, although there is evidence that some of its men would refuse to oppose the King. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen [[Alderman|aldermen]], including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref> In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low.<ref>Day 2007 p. 68</ref> It's possible that this was what prompted Massey consider surrendering the city, though his message suggesting he would may have been a subterfuge designed to buy some time.<ref>Day 2007 p. 73</ref> There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, including Massey and particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve. Officers and councillors with Royalist sympathies were given the opportunity to leave, and those who remained were required to restate an oath of allegiance to Parliament. The discipline of the troops was improved by paying them, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nAs Charles marched north from Bristol, reinforcements were converging on Gloucester from Oxford, Worcester and Herefordshire.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 86\u201387</ref> By the afternoon of 10 August the Royalist army, comprising some 6,000 infantry and 2,500 mounted troops, began assembling around the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 90\u201391</ref> Charles set up his headquarters at [[Matson, Gloucester|Matson]] House.<ref>Day 2007 p. 97</ref> His demand for Gloucester's surrender was unanimously and somewhat insolently rejected, and the Parliamentarians set fire to the suburbs outside the city defences to clear lines of fire and deprive the Royalists of cover.<ref>Day 2007 pp. , 91\u201393,96</ref> Charles had decided to march on Gloucester in the belief that the city would be quickly surrendered. Now that gambit had failed, he decided to besiege it. His pride had been wounded by the manner of the Parliamentarian rejection. His commanders, assessing the state of the city's defences, supplies and morale, persuaded him the city could be taken within ten days without an assault. Intelligence indicated the even if the Parliamentarians were able to send a relieving force, it could be easily defeated before it could reach the city. Most decisively, the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]], whose support was necessary in any campaign against London, declared himself unable to march south while Hull remained in Parliamentarian hands, leaving Charles too weak to contemplate such a move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\nThe first shots were fired in the afternoon as Sir [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] established his forces near Issold's House on the eastern side of the city. [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Lord Forth]], who had been given overall command of the siege, set up a fortified leaguer to the rear of the ruined [[Llanthony Secunda Priory]] and established his forces to the south of the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 95\u201396, 99, 100\u2013101</ref> By dawn on 11 August, a line of trenches had been dug some {{convert|130|yd|m}} from the walls, placing the two sides within musket range of each other, stretching from [[Brunswick Square, Gloucester|Gaudy Green]] on the south side to Issold's House on the east.<ref>Day 2007 p. 99</ref> Massey responded with spoiling tactics in an attempt to hinder Royalist siege operations and delay the assault he was expecting. At midnight a small raiding party succeeded in disrupting Royalist entrenching operations on Gaudy Green, and a larger raid on the green the next morning, 12 August, resulted in the capture of Royalist men, tools and weapons.<ref>Day 2007 p. 100</ref> By this time, the reinforcements from Herefordshire and Worcester under the command of Sir William Vavasour arrived on the west bank of the Severn and began crossing the river to take up positions at Kingsholm, to the north of the city. This force increased the size of the besieging army by another 2,400 infantry and over 300 cavalry. They too were the target of a Parliamentarian raid which inflicted up to fifteen casualties on the Royalists.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 100</ref>\n\nLater on 12 August, Forth completed an earthwork square on Gaudy Green, in which he placed two 24-pounders, the largest of the Royalist's eight cannon, along with a 12-pounder to target the south wall. Another artillery emplacement was positioned to target the east wall nearby.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 99\u2013102</ref> With the artillery in place, the Royalists began bombarding the walls, with the main effort beginning at 11:00 on 13 August. The cannon were too light to have any significant impact, and of the two mortars the Royalists possessed, one, reputed to be the largest in the country, exploded on its first use. When it became evident the Royalists were focusing their efforts on the south-east corner of the city defences, Massey quickly buttressed the medieval walls with up to {{convert|5|ft|m}} of earth, which ensured that the defences held. Meanwhile, the majority of Vavasour's troops completed their crossing of the Severn, leaving behind a small contingent to blockade the west bank.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 100\u2013102</ref>\n\nReacting to rumours that Vavasour had received a reinforcement of artillery, the Parliamentarians mounted another raid to the north of the city on 14 August. They captured two prisoners but failed in their primary objective of locating and spiking any guns.<ref>Day 2007 p. 102</ref> The Royalist bombardment continued through 14 August, but a breach blown in the wall by the larger guns on Gaudy Green was quickly plugged by the defenders with woolsacks and [[gabion]]s. Royalist engineers mining towards the walls from trenches at the green succeeded in draining the ditch below the walls, but this was not followed up with an assault. By the end of the day the Royalist guns had fallen silent; the evidence suggests they had run out of ammunition.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 102\u2013103</ref>\n\nThe following day Vavasour received a reinforcement of 500 [[Glamorgan]] militia and 450 musketeers from Bristol, while the Parliamentarians bolstered the earthwork defences around the south and north gates. On 16 August Rupert accompanied Charles to Oxford, and neither were at Gloucester to witness the most ambitious Parliamentarian raid yet. Just before sunset, 150 musketeers of Stamford's regiment sallied out of the north gate to attack the Royalist trenches east of the city. The Parliamentarians claimed 100 Royalist killed for the cost of 2 injured, while Royalist sources report 24 Parliamentarians killed and more wounded, for the loss of 4 Royalists killed.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 103\u2013105</ref>\n\nStruggling with a shortage of gunpowder and with the guns quiet, the Royalists concentrated on mining operations to breach the city walls. Miners recruited from the [[Forest of Dean]] were set to work under a protective gallery to fill the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} deep by {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} wide moat which, when completed, would allow them to undermine the walls. It was slow work, estimated to need a week to complete. The faster alternative was to forgo the protection and fill the moat with [[fascine]]s. An attempt to do this was beaten back by musket fire from the walls, and resulted in the desertion of the miners.<ref>Day 2007 103, 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy 18 August Vavasour had deployed three cannon in front of his main camp at Kingsholm and another opposite Alvin Gate. These were the targets of a Parliamentarian raid that morning that was even larger than previous efforts; a diversionary attack by 50 men and a main force of 400. All four of Vavasour's cannon were disabled, the Parliamentarians claiming over 100 Royalist casualties for the loss of 6, the Royalists admitting 28 casualties and claiming to have killed 27 Parliamentarians. Another Parliamentarian raid the same day involved their only recorded use of cavalry during the siege, when 150 musketeers and 40 cavalry mounted an ineffectual attack on Royalist positions to the east of the city. Charles, meanwhile, was on his way back to Gloucester with another 1,000 reinforcements.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy the morning of 19 August, two 6-pounder cannon had been installed in a third emplacement opposite the east gate, bringing all the original artillery online. At 10:00, the bombardment was resumed in a last effort to subdue the city by the original ten-day deadline. Constrained by the limited supplies of ammunition and gunpowder, the bombardment had little material effect, though it prompted Massey to hastily erect a breastwork in the open ground of Friar's Orchard, at the south east corner of the city where the Royalist artillery was being concentrated. A Royalist attempt to cross the moat after dark was beaten back by musket fire. The objective of forcing the surrender of Gloucester by siege in ten days had failed, partly due to the city's resolve and Massey's spoiling attacks, but mainly due to the inadequacy of the Royalist artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 107\u2013109</ref> \n\nThe Parliamentarians mounted another raid at dawn on 21 August. It was a two-pronged attack designed to disable the Royalist artillery south and east of the walls. One detachment travelled by boat down the Severn, landed between Forth's camp and a redoubt opposite the castle and successfuly stormed the redoubt. The second detachment of 200 musketeers sallied from the north gate. Intending first to attack the battery opposite the east gate, this force became lost and blundered into Royalist infantry camps. When Massey saw that the raid was not going to plan, he sounded the recall. The Parliamentarians suffered eight casualties, the Royalists more than twenty. Such raids were proving risky and wasteful of the garrison's limited ammunition, and this was the last large-scale operation mounted by the Parliamentarians.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 112\u2013113</ref>\n\nAs the Royalists set about replenishing their stocks of ammunition, they intensified their mining efforts. It was anticipated that the original effort to bridge the moat would allow the besiegers to reach the east wall on 24 August. A second effort to bridge the moat to the south was begun, as was a more complicated project to tunnel towards the east gate. Royalist agents attempted to persuade the garrison to surrender, and Royalist cavalry staged a mock battle in an unsuccessful attempt to lure the garrison out of the city in the belief that a relief force had arrived.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 114\u2013115</ref> A desultory bombardment was maintained, particularly by the mortars, until 25 August, when it was intensified. An attempt that day by Massey to disrupt it with a sally from the north gate was beaten back by cavalry, but as before, a shortage of ammunition \u2013 at one stage the Royalists resorted to firing stones \u2013 blunted the impact, and little damage was done to the city.<ref>Day 2007 p. 116</ref>\n\nFollowing news that the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] was raising a Parliamentarian army in London, Charles and Rupert travelled to Oxford on 26 August, where they held a two-day council of war. With no intelligence of Essex's plans, the Royalists bolstered the defences of Oxford with troops earmarked for the siege of Gloucester while the Royalist garrison at Bristol was urged to send all the forces it could spare to Gloucester. Believing that Essex could muster no more than 6,000 troops, the decision was made to continue the siege, though contingency plans for the blockade of Gloucester were drawn up in case it had to be lifted. [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Lord Wilmot]] was instructed to muster 2,000 cavalry around [[Banbury]]. Their task would be to delay the Parliamentarians in the [[Cotswolds]] until Rupert could come up with the rest of the Royalist cavalry in support, should Essex march to the relief of Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 117\u2013118</ref>\n\nEssex began his march from [[Colnbrook]], west of London, on 26 August.<ref>Day 2007 p. 127</ref> His plan was to relieve Gloucester without provoking a major battle in which, with the Royalist superiority in cavalry, he would be at a disdvantage. His route was dictated by the desire to minimise the amount of open country favourable to cavalry operations he would have to pass through, and took him north of Oxford via Aylesbury and Bicester and then across the Cotswolds.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 124\u2013126</ref> At the beginning of September Essex was due north of Oxford with an army of some 10,500 infantry, no more than 4,500 mounted troops and an artillery train that is estimated at no more than 50 guns.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 130\u2013131, 133</ref>\n\nBy the end of the siege, Massey had only three barrels of gunpowder left for the defence of the city.\n\n==Aftermath==\nWith the arrival of the Earl of Essex, the Royalists forces withdrew and began to march on towards London. They intercepted Essex's army at the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to destroy it. For the remainder of the war, Massey's force based in Gloucester continually threatened the lines of communication between Oxford, the King's wartime capital, and Wales and the West Country.\n\nFollowing the return of Charles II to the throne, the king took his revenge upon the city by having its walls torn down. The foundations of the wall, however, are still visible in parts of the city today.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==Commemoration==\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]].

It took place between 10 August and 5 September 1643, between the defending Parliamentarian garrison of [[Gloucester]] and the besieging army of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. The siege ended with the arrival of a relieving Parliamentarian army under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]. The Royalist forces withdrew, having sustained heavy casualties and had several cannons disabled as a result of sallies made by the defenders.\n\n==Prelude==\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, seized Bristol. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201355</ref> On 6 August the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused to surrender the city, but in a secret communication he let it be known that he would do so if the King, rather than Rupert, led the army on Gloucester. Charles decided the next day that this was the best chance of securing Gloucester quickly and without bloodshed. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 55\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined [[Gloucester Castle|castle]] by the river and a stretch of wall that linked the south, east and original north fates, the last known as the inner north gate and now well within the city, still survived. From the south gate to the east gate the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe fall of Bristol prompted the hurried reinforcement of the existing defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from the south gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to the outer north gate. From there the River Twyver formed a moat as the earthwork followed it north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This easternmost channel of the River Severn had dried up by the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988 para. 2</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west to a point a short distance north of Westgate Street, from where it was extended the other side of the Old Severn to the River Severn just above the west gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at the inner north gate via [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The outer north gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline. The Town Regiment lacked experience but was motivated by its ties to the city it was defending, although there is evidence that some of its men would refuse to oppose the King. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen [[Alderman|aldermen]], including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref> In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low.<ref>Day 2007 p. 68</ref> It's possible that this was what prompted Massey consider surrendering the city, though his message suggesting he would may have been a subterfuge designed to buy some time.<ref>Day 2007 p. 73</ref> There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, including Massey and particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve.

The discipline of the troops was improved by paying them, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nAs Charles marched north from Bristol, reinforcements were converging on Gloucester from Oxford, Worcester and Herefordshire.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 86\u201387</ref> By the afternoon of 10 August the Royalist army, comprising some 6,000 infantry and 2,500 mounted troops, began assembling around the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 90\u201391</ref> Charles set up his headquarters at [[Matson, Gloucester|Matson]] House.<ref>Day 2007 p. 97</ref> His demand for Gloucester's surrender was unanimously and somewhat insolently rejected, and the Parliamentarians set fire to the suburbs outside the city defences to clear lines of fire and deprive the Royalists of cover.<ref>Day 2007 pp. , 91\u201393,96</ref> Charles had decided to march on Gloucester in the belief that the city would be quickly surrendered.

Intelligence indicated the even if the Parliamentarians were able to send a relieving force, it could be easily defeated before it could reach the city. Most decisively, the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]], whose support was necessary in any campaign against London, declared himself unable to march south while Hull remained in Parliamentarian hands, leaving Charles too weak to contemplate such a move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\nThe first shots were fired in the afternoon as Sir [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] established his forces near Issold's House on the eastern side of the city. [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Lord Forth]], who had been given overall command of the siege, set up a fortified leaguer to the rear of the ruined [[Llanthony Secunda Priory]] and established his forces to the south of the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 95\u201396, 99, 100\u2013101</ref> By dawn on 11 August, a line of trenches had been dug some {{convert|130|yd|m}} from the walls, placing the two sides within musket range of each other, stretching from [[Brunswick Square, Gloucester|Gaudy Green]] on the south side to Issold's House on the east.<ref>Day 2007 p. 99</ref> Massey responded with spoiling tactics in an attempt to hinder Royalist siege operations and delay the assault he was expecting. At midnight a small raiding party succeeded in disrupting Royalist entrenching operations on Gaudy Green, and a larger raid on the green the next morning, 12 August, resulted in the capture of Royalist men, tools and weapons.<ref>Day 2007 p. 100</ref> By this time, the reinforcements from Herefordshire and Worcester under the command of Sir William Vavasour arrived on the west bank of the Severn and began crossing the river to take up positions at Kingsholm, to the north of the city. This force increased the size of the besieging army by another 2,400 infantry and over 300 cavalry. They too were the target of a Parliamentarian raid which inflicted up to fifteen casualties on the Royalists.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 100</ref>\n\nLater on 12 August, Forth completed an earthwork square on Gaudy Green, in which he placed two 24-pounders, the largest of the Royalist's eight cannon, along with a 12-pounder to target the south wall. Another artillery emplacement was positioned to target the east wall nearby.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 99\u2013102</ref> With the artillery in place, the Royalists began bombarding the walls, with the main effort beginning at 11:00 on 13 August. The cannon were too light to have any significant impact, and of the two mortars the Royalists possessed, one, reputed to be the largest in the country, exploded on its first use. When it became evident the Royalists were focusing their efforts on the south-east corner of the city defences, Massey quickly buttressed the medieval walls with up to {{convert|5|ft|m}} of earth, which ensured that the defences held. Meanwhile, the majority of Vavasour's troops completed their crossing of the Severn, leaving behind a small contingent to blockade the west bank.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 100\u2013102</ref>\n\nReacting to rumours that Vavasour had received a reinforcement of artillery, the Parliamentarians mounted another raid to the north of the city on 14 August. They captured two prisoners but failed in their primary objective of locating and spiking any guns.<ref>Day 2007 p. 102</ref> The Royalist bombardment continued through 14 August, but a breach blown in the wall by the larger guns on Gaudy Green was quickly plugged by the defenders with woolsacks and [[gabion]]s. Royalist engineers mining towards the walls from trenches at the green succeeded in draining the ditch below the walls, but this was not followed up with an assault. By the end of the day the Royalist guns had fallen silent; the evidence suggests they had run out of ammunition.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 102\u2013103</ref>\n\nThe following day Vavasour received a reinforcement of 500 [[Glamorgan]] militia and 450 musketeers from Bristol, while the Parliamentarians bolstered the earthwork defences around the south and north gates. On 16 August Rupert accompanied Charles to Oxford, and neither were at Gloucester to witness the most ambitious Parliamentarian raid yet. Just before sunset, 150 musketeers of Stamford's regiment sallied out of the north gate to attack the Royalist trenches east of the city. The Parliamentarians claimed 100 Royalist killed for the cost of 2 injured, while Royalist sources report 24 Parliamentarians killed and more wounded, for the loss of 4 Royalists killed.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 103\u2013105</ref>\n\nStruggling with a shortage of gunpowder and with the guns quiet, the Royalists concentrated on mining operations to breach the city walls. Miners recruited from the [[Forest of Dean]] were set to work under a protective cover to fill the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} deep by {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} wide moat which, when completed, would allow them to undermine the walls. It was slow work, estimated to need a week to complete. The faster alternative was to forgo the protection and fill the moat with [[fascine]]s. An attempt to do this was beaten back by musket fire from the walls, and resulted in the desertion of the miners.<ref>Day 2007 103, 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy 18 August Vavasour had deployed three cannon in front of his main camp at Kingsholm and another opposite Alvin Gate. These were the targets of a Parliamentarian raid that morning that was even larger than previous efforts; a diversionary attack by 50 men and a main force of 400. All four of Vavasour's cannon were disabled, the Parliamentarians claiming over 100 Royalist casualties for the loss of 6, the Royalists admitting 28 casualties and claiming to have killed 27 Parliamentarians. Another Parliamentarian raid the same day involved their only recorded use of cavalry during the siege, when 150 musketeers and 40 cavalry mounted an ineffectual attack on Royalist positions to the east of the city. Charles, meanwhile, was on his way back to Gloucester with another 1,000 reinforcements.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy the morning of 19 August, two 6-pounder cannon had been installed in a third emplacement opposite the east gate, bringing all the original artillery online. At 10:00, the bombardment was resumed in a last effort to subdue the city by the original ten-day deadline. Constrained by the limited supplies of ammunition and gunpowder, the bombardment had little material effect, though it prompted Massey to hastily erect a breastwork in the open ground of Friar's Orchard, at the south east corner of the city where the Royalist artillery was being concentrated. A Royalist attempt to cross the moat after dark was beaten back by musket fire. The objective of forcing the surrender of Gloucester by siege in ten days had failed, partly due to the city's resolve and Massey's spoiling attacks, but mainly due to the inadequacy of the Royalist artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 107\u2013109</ref> \n\nThe Parliamentarians mounted another raid at dawn on 21 August. It was a two-pronged attack designed to disable the Royalist artillery south and east of the walls. One detachment travelled by boat down the Severn, landed between Forth's camp and a redoubt opposite the castle and successfuly stormed the redoubt. The second detachment of 200 musketeers sallied from the north gate. Intending first to attack the battery opposite the east gate, this force became lost and blundered into Royalist infantry camps. When Massey saw that the raid was not going to plan, he sounded the recall. The Parliamentarians suffered eight casualties, the Royalists more than twenty. Such raids were proving risky and wasteful of the garrison's limited ammunition, and this was the last large-scale operation mounted by the Parliamentarians.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 112\u2013113</ref>\n\nAs the Royalists set about replenishing their stocks of ammunition, they intensified their mining efforts. It was anticipated that the original effort to bridge the moat would allow the besiegers to reach the east wall on 24 August. A second effort to bridge the moat to the south was begun, as was a more complicated project to tunnel towards the east gate. Royalist agents attempted to persuade the garrison to surrender, and Royalist cavalry staged a mock battle in an unsuccessful attempt to lure the garrison out of the city in the belief that a relief force had arrived.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 114\u2013115</ref> A desultory bombardment was maintained, particularly by the mortars, until 25 August, when it was intensified. An attempt that day by Massey to disrupt it with a sally from the north gate was beaten back by cavalry, but as before, a shortage of ammunition \u2013 at one stage the Royalists resorted to firing stones \u2013 blunted the impact, and little damage was done to the city.<ref>Day 2007 p. 116</ref>\n\nFollowing news that the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] was raising a Parliamentarian army in London, Charles and Rupert travelled to Oxford on 26 August, where they held a two-day council of war. With no intelligence of Essex's plans, the Royalists bolstered the defences of Oxford with troops earmarked for the siege of Gloucester while the Royalist garrison at Bristol was urged to send all the forces it could spare to Gloucester. Believing that Essex could muster no more than 6,000 troops, the decision was made to continue the siege, though contingency plans for the blockade of Gloucester were drawn up in case it had to be lifted. [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Lord Wilmot]] was instructed to muster 2,000 cavalry around [[Banbury]]. Their task would be to delay the Parliamentarians in the [[Cotswolds]] until Rupert could come up with the rest of the Royalist cavalry in support, should Essex march to the relief of Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 117\u2013118</ref>\n\nEssex began his march from [[Colnbrook]], west of London, on 26 August.<ref>Day 2007 p. 127</ref> His plan was to relieve Gloucester without provoking a major battle in which, with the Royalist superiority in cavalry, he would be at a disdvantage. His route was dictated by the desire to minimise the amount of open country favourable to cavalry operations he would have to pass through, and took him north of Oxford via Aylesbury and Bicester and then across the Cotswolds.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 124\u2013126</ref> At the beginning of September Essex was due north of Oxford with an army of some 10,500 infantry, no more than 4,500 mounted troops and an artillery train that is estimated at no more than 50 guns.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 130\u2013131, 133</ref>\n\nBy the end of the siege, Massey had only three barrels of gunpowder left for the defence of the city.\n\n==Aftermath==\nWith the arrival of the Earl of Essex, the Royalists forces withdrew and began to march on towards London. They intercepted Essex's army at the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to destroy it. For the remainder of the war, Massey's force based in Gloucester continually threatened the lines of communication between Oxford, the King's wartime capital, and Wales and the West Country.\n\nFollowing the return of Charles II to the throne, the king took his revenge upon the city by having its walls torn down. The foundations of the wall, however, are still visible in parts of the city today.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==Commemoration==\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]]. This died out in the nineteenth century but was reinstated in 2009.<ref name=bbc>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/8239588.stm Tradition revived for city pride.] BBC News, 5 September 2009.

This caused Sonam Rabten who became the 5th Dalai Lama's ''changdzo'' or manager,<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 198.</ref> to seek more active Mongol patronage and military assistance for the Gelugpa while the Fifth was still a boy.<ref name=TN2 /> So, in 1620, Mongol troops allied to the Gelugpa who had camped outside Lhasa suddenly attacked and destroyed the two Tsangpa camps and drove them out of Lhasa, enabling the Dalai Lama to be brought out of hiding and publicly enthroned there in 1622.<ref name=shak101 />\n\nIn fact, throughout the 5th's minority, it was the influential and forceful Sonam Rabten who inspired the [[Dzungars|Dzungar Mongols]] to defend the Gelugpa by attacking their enemies. These enemies included other Mongol tribes who supported the Tsangpas, the Tsangpa themselves and their B\u00f6npo allies in Kham who had also opposed and persecuted Gelugpas.

In 1648, after quelling a rebellion of Tibetans of Kansu-Xining, the Qing invited the Fifth Dalai Lama to visit their court at Beijing since they wished to engender Tibetan influence in their dealings with the Mongols. The Qing were aware the Dalai Lama had extraordinary influence with the Mongols and saw relations with the Dalai Lama as a means to facilitate submission of the [[Khalka Mongols]], traditional patrons of the [[Karma Kagyu]] sect. Similarly, since the Tibetan Gelugpa were keen to revive a [[priest-patron]] relationship with the dominant power in China and Inner Asia, the Qing invitation was accepted. After five years of complex diplomatic negotiations about whether the emperor or his representatives should meet the Dalai Lama inside or outside the Great Wall, when the meeting would be astrologically favourable, how it would be conducted and so on, it eventually took place in Beijing in 1653. The Shunzhi Emperor was then 16 years old, having in the meantime ascended the throne in 1650 after the death of Dorgon. For the Qing, although the Dalai Lama was not required to [[kowtow]] to the emperor, who rose from his throne and advanced 30 feet to meet him, the significance of the visit was that of nominal political submission by the Dalai Lama since Inner Asian heads of state did not travel to meet each other but sent envoys. For Tibetan Buddhist historians however it was interpreted as the start of an era of independent rule of the Dalai Lamas, and of Qing patronage alongside that of the Mongols.<ref>Smith 1997, pp. 108\u2013113.</ref>\n\nWhen the 5th Dalai Lama returned, he was granted by the emperor of China a golden seal of authority and golden sheets with texts written in Manchu, Tibetan and Chinese languages.<ref name=\"\u9648\u5e86\u82f12005_p41\">{{cite book |author=\u9648\u5e86\u82f1 |title=\u8fbe\u8d56\u5587\u561b\u8f6c\u4e16\u53ca\u5386\u53f2\u5b9a\u5236\u82f1 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=haMIsdC3iZwC&pg=PA41 |year=2005 |publisher=\u4e94\u6d32\u4f20\u64ad\u51fa\u7248\u793e |isbn = 978-7-5085-0745-3 |pages=41\u2013}}</ref><ref name=K309>Karmay 2014, p. 309.</ref> The 5th Dalai Lama wanted to use the golden seal of authority right away.<ref name=\"\u9648\u5e86\u82f12005_p41\" /> However, Lobzang Gyatsho noted that \"The Tibetan version of the inscription of the seal was translated by a Mongolian translator but was not a good translation\".

For example, concerning the above-mentioned 'golden seal', the Fifth Dalai Lama comments in ''Dukula'', his autobiography, on leaving China after this courtesy visit to the emperor in 1653, that \"the emperor made his men bring a golden seal for me that had three vertical lines in three parallel scripts: Chinese, Mongolian and Tibetan\". He also criticised the words carved on this gift as being faultily translated into Tibetan, writing that \"The Tibetan version of the inscription of the seal was translated by a Mongol translator but was not a good translation\".<ref name=K309/> Furthermore, when he arrived back in Tibet, he discarded the emperor's famous golden seal and made a new one for important state usage, writing in his autobiography: \"Leaving out the Chinese characters that were on the seal given by the emperor, a new seal was carved for stamping documents that dealt with territorial issues. The first imprint of the seal was offered with prayers to the image of Lokeshvara ...\".<ref>Karmay 2014, p. 402.</ref>\n\n==== Relations with the Qing dynasty ====\nThe 17th-century struggles for domination between the Manchu-led Qing dynasty and the various Mongol groups spilled over to involve Tibet because of the Fifth Dalai Lama's strong influence over the Mongols as a result of their general adoption of Tibetan Buddhism and their consequent deep loyalty to the Dalai Lama as their guru. Until 1674, the Fifth Dalai Lama had mediated in [[Dzungar people|Dzungar Mongol]] affairs whenever they required him to do so, and the [[Kangxi Emperor]], who had succeeded the Shunzhi Emperor in 1661, would accept and confirm his decisions automatically. For the Kangxi Emperor however, the alliance between the Dzungar Mongols and the Tibetans was unsettling because he feared it had the potential to unite all the other Mongol tribes together against the Qing Empire, including those tribes who had already submitted. Therefore, in 1674, the Kangxi Emperor, annoyed by the Fifth's less than full cooperation in quelling a rebellion against the Qing in [[Yunnan]], ceased deferring to him as regards Mongol affairs and started dealing with them directly.<ref name=TN6>Smith 1997, pp. 116\u2013117.</ref>\n\nIn the same year, 1674, the Dalai Lama, then at the height of his powers and conducting a foreign policy independent of the Qing, caused Mongol troops to occupy the border post of [[Dartsedo]] between Kham and Sichuan, further annoying the Kangxi Emperor who (according to Smith) already considered Tibet as part of the Qing Empire. It also increased Qing suspicion about Tibetan relations with the Mongol groups and led him to seek strategic opportunities to oppose and undermine Mongol influence in Tibet and eventually, within 50 years, to defeat the Mongols militarily and to establish the Qing as sole 'patrons and protectors' of Tibet in their place.<ref name=TN6 />\n\n==== Cultural development ====\nThe time of the Fifth Dalai Lama, who reigned from 1642 to 1682 and founded the government known as the [[Ganden Phodrang]], was a period of rich cultural development.<ref>Snellgrove & Richardson 1968, p. 197.</ref> His reign and that of [[Desi Sangye Gyatso]] are noteworthy for the upsurge in literary activity and of cultural and economic life that occurred. The same goes for the great increase in the number of foreign visitors thronging Lhasa during the period as well as for the number of inventions and institutions that are attributed to the 'Great Fifth', as the Tibetans refer to him.<ref>Stein 1972, p. 84\u20135.</ref> The most dynamic and prolific of the early Dalai Lamas, he composed more literary works than all the other Dalai Lamas combined. Writing on a wide variety of subjects he is specially noted for his works on history, classical Indian poetry in Sanskrit and his biographies of notable personalities of his epoch, as well as his own two autobiographies, one spiritual in nature and the other political (see [[Dalai Lama#Further reading|Further Reading]]).<ref name=mull83244>Mullin 1983, p. 244.</ref> He also taught and travelled extensively, reshaped the politics of Central Asia, unified Tibet, conceived and constructed the Potala Palace and is remembered for establishing systems of national medical care and education.<ref name=mull83244 />\n\n==== Death of the fifth Dalai Lama ====\nThe Fifth Dalai Lama died in 1682. Tibetan historian Nyima Gyaincain points out that the written wills from the fifth Dalai Lama before he died explicitly said his title and authority were from the Emperor of China, and he was subordinate of the Emperor of China\n.<ref name=\"\u738b\u5bb6\u4f1f\u5c3c\u739b\u575a\u8d5e1997\" />\n\nThe Fifth Dalai Lama's death in 1682 was kept secret for fifteen years by his regent [[Desi Sangye Gyatso]]. He pretended the Dalai Lama was in retreat and ruled on his behalf, secretly selecting the 6th Dalai Lama and presenting him as someone else. Tibetan historian Nyima Gyaincain points out that Desi Sangye Gyatso wanted to consolidate his personal status and power by not reporting the death of the fifth Dalai Lama to the Emperor of China, and also collude with the rebellion group of the Qing dynasty, Mongol [[Dzungar people|Dzungar]] tribe in order to counter influence from another Mongol [[Khoshut]] tribe in Tibet. Being afraid of prosecution by the Kangxi Emperor of China, Desi Sangye Gyatso explained with fear and trepidation the reason behind his action to the Emperor. In 1705, Desi Sangye Gyatso was killed by [[Lha-bzang Khan]] of the Mongol [[Khoshut]] tribe because of his actions including his illegal action of selecting the 6th Dalai Lama. Since the Kangxi Emperor was not happy about Desi Sangye Gyatso's action of not reporting, the Emperor gave [[Lha-bzang Khan]] additional title and golden seal. The Kangxi Emperor also ordered [[Lha-bzang Khan]] to arrest the 6th Dalai Lama and send him to Beijing, the 6th Dalai Lama died when he was en route to Beijing.<ref name=\"\u738b\u5bb6\u4f1f\u5c3c\u739b\u575a\u8d5e1997\" /> Journalist Thomas Laird argues that it was apparently done so that construction of the Potala Palace could be finished, and it was to prevent Tibet's neighbors, the Mongols and the Qing, from taking advantage of an interregnum in the succession of the Dalai Lamas.{{harv|Laird|2006|pp=181\u2013182}}\n\n=== 6th Dalai Lama ===\nThe [[6th Dalai Lama|Sixth Dalai Lama]] (1683\u20131706) was born near [[Tawang]], now in India, and picked out in 1685 but not enthroned until 1697 when the death of the Fifth was announced. After 16 years of study as a novice monk, in 1702 in his 20th year he rejected full ordination and gave up his monk's robes and monastic life, preferring the lifestyle of a layman.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 245\u2013256.</ref><ref>Karenina Kollmar-Paulenz, ''Kleine Geschichte Tibets'', M\u00fcnchen 2006, pp. 109\u2013122.</ref>\n\nIn 1703 G\u00fcshi Khan's ruling grandson Tenzin Wangchuk Khan was murdered by his brother [[Lha-bzang Khan|Lhazang Khan]] who usurped the Khoshut's Tibetan throne, but unlike his four predecessors he started interfering directly in Tibetan affairs in Lhasa; he opposed the Fifth Dalai Lama's regent, [[Desi Sangye Gyatso]] for his deceptions and in the same year, with the support of the Kangxi Emperor, he forced him out of office. Then in 1705, he used the Sixth's escapades as an excuse to seize full control of Tibet. Most Tibetans, though, still supported their Dalai Lama despite his behaviour and deeply resented Lhazang Khan's interference. When Lhazang was requested by the Tibetans to leave Lhasa politics to them and to retire to Kokonor like his predecessors, he quit the city, but only to gather his armies in order to return, capture Lhasa militarily and assume full political control of Tibet.<ref>Smith 1997, p. 121.</ref> The regent was then murdered by Lhazang or his wife, and, in 1706 with the compliance of the Kangxi Emperor the Sixth Dalai Lama was deposed and arrested by Lhazang who considered him to be an impostor set up by the regent. [[Lhazang Khan]], now acting as the only outright foreign ruler that Tibet had ever had, then sent him to Beijing under escort to appear before the emperor but he died mysteriously on the way near [[Lake Qinghai]], ostensibly from illness.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 260\u2013271.</ref><ref name=\"HarperCollins\">Smith 1997, p. 122.</ref>\n\nHaving discredited and deposed the Sixth Dalai Lama, whom he considered an impostor, and having removed the regent, Lhazang Khan pressed the Lhasa Gelugpa lamas to endorse a new Dalai Lama in [[Tsangyang Gyatso]]'s place as the true incarnation of the Fifth. They eventually nominated one Pekar Dzinpa, a monk but also rumored to be Lhazang's son,<ref>McKay 2003, p. 569.</ref> and Lhazang had him installed as the 'real' Sixth Dalai Lama, endorsed by the [[Panchen Lama]] and named [[Yeshe Gyatso]] in 1707.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 274.</ref> This choice was in no way accepted by the Tibetan people, however, nor by Lhazang's princely Mongol rivals in Kokonor who resented his usurpation of the [[Khoshut]] Tibetan throne as well as his meddling in Tibetan affairs. The Kangxi Emperor concurred with them, after sending investigators, initially declining to recognize [[Yeshe Gyatso]]. He did recognize him in 1710, however, after sending a Qing official party to assist Lhazang in 'restoring order'; these were the first Chinese representatives of any sort to officiate in Tibet.<ref name=\"HarperCollins\" /> At the same time, while this puppet 'Dalai Lama' had no political power, the Kangxi Emperor secured from Lhazang Khan in return for this support the promise of regular payments of tribute; this was the first time tribute had been paid to the Manchu by the Mongols in Tibet and the first overt acknowledgment of Qing supremacy over Mongol rule in Tibet.<ref>Richardson 1984, p. 48.</ref>\n\n=== 7th Dalai Lama ===\nIn 1708, in accordance with an indication given by the [[6th Dalai Lama]] when quitting Lhasa a child called Kelzang Gyatso had been born at [[Lithang]] in eastern Tibet who was soon claimed by local Tibetans to be his incarnation. After going into hiding out of fear of Lhazang Khan, he was installed in Lithang monastery. Along with some of the Kokonor Mongol princes, rivals of Lhazang, in defiance of the situation in Lhasa the Tibetans of [[Kham]] duly recognised him as the [[Seventh Dalai Lama]] in 1712, retaining his birth-name of [[Kelzang Gyatso]]. For security reasons he was moved to [[Derge]] monastery and eventually, in 1716, now also backed and sponsored by the Kangxi Emperor of China.<ref name=\"Mullin 2001, p.276-281\">Mullin 2001, p. 276\u2013281.</ref> The Tibetans asked Dzungars to bring a true Dalai Lama to Lhasa, but the Manchu Chinese did not want to release Kelsan Gyatso to the Mongol Dzungars. The Regent Taktse Shabdrung and Tibetan officials then wrote a letter to the Manchu Chinese Emperor that they recognized Kelsang Gyatso as the Dalai Lama.

By the end of the year, with Tibetan connivance they had captured Lhasa, killed Lhazang and all his family and deposed [[Yeshe Gyatso]]. Their force sent to fetch Kelzang Gyatso however was intercepted and destroyed by Qing armies alerted by Lhazang. In Lhasa, the unruly Dzungar not only failed to produce the boy but also went on the rampage, looting and destroying the holy places, abusing the populace, killing hundreds of Nyingma monks, causing chaos and bloodshed and turning their Tibetan allies against them.

On the imperial army's stately passage from [[Kumbum]] to Lhasa with the boy being welcomed adoringly at every stage, [[Khoshut]] Mongols and Tibetans were happy (and well paid) to join and swell its ranks.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 287\u20139.</ref> By the autumn of 1720 the marauding [[Dzungar people|Dzungar Mongols]] had been vanquished from Tibet and the Qing imperial forces had entered Lhasa triumphantly with the 12-year-old, acting as patrons of the Dalai Lama, liberators of Tibet, allies of the Tibetan anti-Dzungar forces led by [[Khangchenn\u00e9|Kangchenas]] and [[Polhan\u00e9 S\u00f6nam Topgy\u00e9|Polhanas]], and allies of the [[Khoshut]] Mongol princes.

Kelzang Gyatso, too young to participate in politics, studied Buddhism. He played a symbolic role in government, and, being profoundly revered by the Mongols, he exercised much influence with the Qing who now had now taken over Tibet's [[Priest-patron|patronage and protection]] from them.<ref>Smith 1997, pp. 124\u20136.</ref>\n\n==== Exile to Kham ====\nHaving vanquished the Dzungars, the Qing army withdrew leaving the [[Seventh Dalai Lama]] as a political figurehead and only a [[Khalkha Mongol]] as the Qing ''[[amban]]'' or representative and a garrison in Lhasa.<ref name=\"Mullin 2001, p.291\">Mullin 2001, p. 291.</ref><ref name=TN7>Smith 1997, p. 127.</ref> After the Kangxi Emperor died in 1722 and was succeeded by his son, the [[Yongzheng Emperor]], these were also withdrawn, leaving the Tibetans [[Autonomous|to rule autonomously]] and showing the Qing were interested in an alliance, not conquest.<ref name=\"Mullin 2001, p.291\" /><ref name=TN7 /> In 1723, however, after brutally quelling a major rebellion by zealous Tibetan patriots and disgruntled [[Khoshut]] Mongols from Amdo who attacked [[Xining]], the Qing intervened again, splitting Tibet by putting [[Amdo]] and [[Kham]] under their own more direct control.<ref>Smith 1997, pp. 125\u20136.</ref> Continuing Qing interference in [[Central Tibet]]an politics and religion incited an anti-Qing faction to quarrel with the Qing-sympathising Tibetan nobles in power in Lhasa, led by [[Khangchenn\u00e9|Kanchenas]] who was supported by [[Pholhane|Polhanas]]. This led eventually to the murder of [[Khangchenn\u00e9|Kanchenas]] in 1727 and a civil war that was resolved in 1728 with the canny [[Pholhane|Polhanas]], who had sent for Qing assistance, the victor. When the Qing forces did arrive they punished the losers and exiled the [[Seventh Dalai Lama]] to Kham, under the pretence of sending him to Beijing, because his father had assisted the defeated, anti-Qing faction. He studied and taught Buddhism there for the next seven years.<ref>Smith 1997, pp. 129\u201330.</ref>\n\n==== Return to Lhasa ====\nIn 1735 he was allowed back to Lhasa to study and teach, but still under strict control, being mistrusted by the Qing, while [[Polhan\u00e9 S\u00f6nam Topgy\u00e9|Polhanas]] ruled [[Central Tibet]] under nominal Qing supervision. Meanwhile, the Qing had promoted the [[Fifth Panchen Lama]] to be a rival leader and reinstated the ''ambans'' and the Lhasa garrison. Polhanas died in 1747 and was succeeded by his son [[Gyurme Namgyal]], the last dynastic ruler of Tibet, who was far less cooperative with the Qing. On the contrary, he built a Tibetan army and started conspiring with the Dzungars to rid Tibet of Qing influence.<ref>Shakabpa 1967, pp. 147\u20138.</ref> In 1750, when the ''ambans'' realised this, they invited him and personally assassinated him and then, despite the Dalai Lama's attempts to calm the angered populace a vengeful Tibetan mob assassinated the ''ambans'' in turn, along with most of their escort.<ref>Smith 1997, p. 130\u2013132.</ref>\n\n==== Restoration as Tibet's political leader ====\nThe Qing sent yet another force 'to restore order' but when it arrived the situation had already been stabilised under the leadership of the [[7th Dalai Lama]] who was now seen to have demonstrated loyalty to the Qing. Just as G\u00fcshi Khan had done with the Fifth Dalai Lama, they therefore helped reconstitute the government with the Dalai Lama presiding over a [[Kashag]] of four Tibetans, reinvesting him with temporal power in addition to his already established spiritual leadership. This arrangement, with a Kashag under the Dalai Lama or his regent, outlasted the Qing dynasty which collapsed in 1912.<ref>Van Schaik 2011, p. 144; Shakabpa 1967, p. 150.</ref> The ''ambans'' and their garrison were also reinstated to observe and to some extent supervise affairs, however, although their influence generally waned with the power of their empire which gradually declined after 1792 along with its influence over Tibet, a decline aided by a succession of corrupt or incompetent ''ambans''.<ref>Smith 1997, p. 137.</ref> Moreover, there was soon no reason for the Qing to fear the [[Dzungar people|Dzungar]]; by the time the [[Seventh Dalai Lama]] died in 1757 at the age of 49, the entire [[Dzungar people]] had been practically exterminated through years of genocidal campaigns by Qing armies, and deadly smallpox epidemics, with the survivors being forcibly transported into China. Their emptied lands were then awarded to other peoples.<ref>Smith 1997, p. 132\u20133.</ref>\n\nAccording to Mullin, despite living through such violent times Kelzang Gyatso was perhaps 'the most spiritually learned and accomplished of any Dalai Lama', his written works comprising several hundred titles including 'some of Tibet's finest spiritual literary achievements'.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 302, p. 308.</ref> In addition, despite his apparent lack of zeal in politics, Kelzang Gyatso is credited with establishing in 1751 the reformed government of Tibet headed by the Dalai Lama, which continued over 200 years until the 1950s, and then in exile.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 303.</ref> Construction of the [[Norbulingka]], the 'Summer Palace' of the Dalai Lamas in Lhasa was also started during Kelzang Gyatso's reign.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Suhasini Haidar|title=At Lhasa, Tibetans still pray for Dalai Lama's return|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world/at-lhasa-tibetans-still-pray-for-dalai-lamas-return/article6367393.ece|accessdate=19 July 2015|newspaper=The Hindu|date=1 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Introduction to The Potala Palace, Jokhang Temple and Norbulingka, Tibet|url=http://worldheritage.routes.travel/world-heritage-site/the-potala-palace-jokhang-temple-and-norbulingka-tibet/|publisher=World Heritage|accessdate=19 July 2015|quote=Norbulingka was built in the 1700s by the seventh Dalai Lama and served as the regular dwelling of future Dalai Lamas.

According to Mullin, the [[14th Dalai Lama]] has pointed to certain indications that [[Jamphel Gyatso]] might not have been the incarnation of the [[7th Dalai Lama]] but of Jamyang Chojey, a disciple of [[Tsongkhapa]] and founder of Drepung monastery who was also reputed to be an incarnation of [[Avalokiteshvara]]. In any case, he mainly lived a quiet and unassuming life as a devoted and studious monk, uninvolved in the kind of dramas that had surrounded his predecessors.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 323\u20137.</ref>\n\nNevertheless, [[Jamphel Gyatso]] was also said to possess all the signs of being the true incarnation of the [[Seventh Dalai Lama|Seventh]]. This was also claimed to have been confirmed by many portents clear to the Tibetans and so, in 1762, at the age of 5, he was duly enthroned as the [[Eighth Dalai Lama]] at the [[Potala Palace]].<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 328\u2013332.</ref> At the age of 23 he was persuaded to assume the throne as ruler of Tibet with a [[Regent]] to assist him and after three years of this, when the Regent went to Beijing as ambassador in 1784, he continued to rule solo for a further four years. Feeling unsuited to worldly affairs, however, and unhappy in this role, he then retired from public office to concentrate on religious activities for his remaining 16 years until his death in 1804.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 333\u20134.</ref> He is also credited with the construction of the [[Norbulingka]] 'Summer Palace' started by his predecessor in Lhasa and with ordaining some ten thousand monks in his efforts to foster monasticism.<ref>Mullin 2001 pp. 338\u20139.</ref>\n\n=== 9th to 12th Dalai Lamas ===\nHugh Richardson's summary of the period covering the four short-lived, 19th-century Dalai Lamas:\n{{quote|After him [the [[8th Dalai Lama]], Jamphel Gyatso], the [[9th Dalai Lama|9th]] and [[10th Dalai Lama]]s died before attaining their majority: one of them is credibly stated to have been murdered and strong suspicion attaches to the other.

For 113 years, therefore, supreme authority in Tibet was in the hands of a Lama Regent, except for about two years when a lay noble held office and for short periods of nominal rule by the 11th and 12th Dalai Lamas.{{efn|According to Mullin, Smith and Shakabpa however, the 12th Dalai Lama's Regent, Reting Rinpoche, was deposed in 1862 in a coup by Gyalpo Shetra and Tibet was ruled by despots or assemblies of abbots and ministers for the next eleven years, that is until 1873 when the 12th Dalai Lama assumed power.}}<br />It has sometimes been suggested that this state of affairs was brought about by the Ambans\u2014the Imperial Residents in Tibet\u2014because it would be easier to control the Tibet through a Regent than when a Dalai Lama, with his absolute power, was at the head of the government. That is not true. The regular ebb and flow of events followed its set course. The Imperial Residents in Tibet, after the first flush of zeal in 1750, grew less and less interested and efficient. Tibet was, to them, exile from the urbanity and culture of Peking; and so far from dominating the Regents, the Ambans allowed themselves to be dominated. It was the ambition and greed for power of Tibetans that led to five successive Dalai Lamas being subjected to continuous tutelage. {{harv|Richardson|1984|pp=59\u201360}}}}\n\n[[Thubten Jigme Norbu]], the elder brother of the 14th Dalai Lama, described these unfortunate events as follows, although there are few, if any, indications that any of the four were said to be 'Chinese-appointed imposters':\n{{quote|It is perhaps more than a coincidence that between the seventh and the thirteenth holders of that office, only one reached his majority. The eighth, Gyampal Gyatso, died when he was in his thirties, Lungtog Gyatso when he was eleven, Tsultrim Gyatso at eighteen, Khadrup Gyatso when he was eighteen also, and Krinla Gyatso at about the same age. The circumstances are such that it is very likely that some, if not all, were poisoned, either by loyal Tibetans for being Chinese-appointed impostors, or by the Chinese for not being properly manageable. Many Tibetans think that this was done at the time when the young [Dalai Lama] made his ritual visit to the Lake Lhamtso. ... Each of the four [Dalai Lamas] to die young expired shortly after his visit to the lake. Many said it was because they were not the true reincarnations, but imposters imposed by the Chinese. Others tell stories of how the cooks of the retinue, which in those days included many Chinese, were bribed to put poison in the [Dalai Lama's] food. The 13th [Dalai Lama] did not visit Lhamtso until he was 25 years old. He was adequately prepared by spiritual exercise and he also had faithful cooks. The Chinese were disappointed when he did not die like his predecessors, and he was to live long enough to give them much more cause for regret.{{harv|Norbu|Turnbull|1968|pp.=311\u2013312}}{{efn|According to their biographies, the [[8th Dalai Lama|Eighth, Jamphel Gyatso]] lived to 46 years old, the [[9th Dalai Lama|Ninth, Lungtok Gyatso]] to 9 years, the [[10th Dalai Lama|Tenth, Tsultrim Gyatso]] to 21, the [[Khedrup Gyatso|Eleventh, Khedrup Gyatso]] to 17 and the [[Trinley Gyatso|Twelfth, Trinley Gyatso]] to 18.}}}}\n\nAccording to Mullin, on the other hand, it is improbable that the [[Manchus]] would have murdered any of these four for being 'unmanageable' since it would have been in their best interests to have strong Dalai Lamas ruling in Lhasa, he argues, agreeing with [[Hugh Edward Richardson|Richardson]] that it was rather \"the ambition and greed for power of Tibetans\" that might have caused the Lamas' early deaths.{{efn|Considering what occurred in Lhasa after the Chinese ''ambans'' murdered [[Gyurme Namgyal]] in 1750, however, the Manchus would have been particularly reluctant to murder a Dalai Lama.}} Further, if Tibetan nobles murdered any of them, it would more likely have been in order to protect or enhance their family interests rather than out of suspicion that the Dalai Lamas were seen as Chinese-appointed imposters as suggested by Norbu. They could also have died from illnesses, possibly contracted from diseases to which they had no immunity, carried to Lhasa by the multitudes of pilgrims visiting from nearby countries for blessings. Finally, from the Buddhist point of view, Mullin says, \"Simply stated, these four Dalai Lamas died young because the world did not have enough good karma to deserve their presence\".<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 343\u20136.</ref>\n\nTibetan historian K. Dhondup, however, in his history ''The Water-Bird and Other Years'', based on the Tibetan minister Surkhang Sawang Chenmo's historical manuscripts,<ref>Dhondup 1986, p. iv.</ref> disagrees with Mullin's opinion that having strong Dalai Lamas in power in Tibet would have been in China's best interests. He notes that many historians are compelled to suspect Manchu foul play in these serial early deaths because the Ambans had such latitude to interfere; the Manchu, he says, \"''to perpetuate their domination over Tibetan affairs, did not desire a Dalai Lama who will ascend the throne and become a strong and capable ruler over his own country and people''\". The life and deeds of the 13th Dalai Lama [in successfully upholding ''de facto'' Tibetan independence from China from 1912 to 1950] serve as the living proof of this argument, he points out.<ref>Dhondup 1986, p. 3.</ref> This account also corresponds with TJ Norbu's observations above.\n\nFinally, while acknowledging the possibility, the [[14th Dalai Lama]] himself doubts they were poisoned. He ascribes the probable cause of these early deaths to negligence, foolishness and lack of proper medical knowledge and attention. \"''Even today''\" he is quoted as saying, \"''when people get sick, some [Tibetans] will say: 'Just do your prayers, you don't need medical treatment.'''\"<ref>Laird 2006, p. 197.</ref>\n\n==== 9th Dalai Lama ====\nBorn in Kham in 1805/6 amidst the usual miraculous signs the [[9th Dalai Lama|Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso]] was appointed by the [[7th Panchen Lama]]'s search team at the age of two and enthroned in the Potala in 1808 at an impressive ceremony attended by representatives from China, Mongolia, Nepal and Bhutan.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 346\u20138.</ref><ref>Shakabpa 1984, p. 172.</ref> Tibetan historian Nyima Gyaincain and Wang Jiawei point out that the 9th Dalai Lama was allowed to use the seal of authority given to the late 8th Dalai Lama by the Emperor of China<ref name=\"Wang\u5c3c\u739b\u575a\u8d5e1997_p71\">{{cite book|author1=Jiawei Wang|author2=\u5c3c\u739b\u575a\u8d5e|title=The Historical Status of China's Tibet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ak3SQTVS7acC&pg=PA71|year=1997|publisher=\u4e94\u6d32\u4f20\u64ad\u51fa\u7248\u793e|isbn=978-7-80113-304-5|pages=71\u2013}}</ref>\n\nHis second Regent Demo Tulku was the biographer of the 8th and 9th Dalai Lamas and though the 9th died at the age of 9 his biography is as lengthy as those of many of the early Dalai Lamas.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 348.</ref> In 1793 under Manchu pressure Tibet had closed its borders to foreigners,<ref>Shakabpa 1984, p. 173.</ref><ref>Richardson 1984, p. 71.</ref> but in 1811 a British Sinologist, [[Thomas Manning (sinologist)|Thomas Manning]] became the first Englishman to visit Lhasa.

After that he was immersed in religious studies under the Panchen Lama, amongst other great masters. Meanwhile, there were court intrigues and ongoing power struggles taking place between the various Lhasa factions, the Regent, the [[Kashag]], the powerful nobles and the abbots and monks of the three great monasteries. The Tsemonling Regent<ref>[http://treasuryoflives.org/biographies/view/Trichen-73-Ngawang-Jampel-Tsultrim-Gyatso/6979|The Second Tsemonling, Ngawang Jampel Tsultrim Gyatso]</ref> became mistrusted and was forcibly deposed, there were machinations, plots, beatings and kidnappings of ministers and so forth, resulting at last in the Panchen Lama being appointed as interim Regent to keep the peace. Eventually the Third Reting Rinpoche was made Regent, and in 1855, Khedrup Gyatso, appearing to be an extremely promising prospect, was requested to take the reins of power at the age of 17.

The respected Reting Rinpoche was recalled once again to act as Regent and requested to lead the search for the next incarnation, the twelfth.<ref name=M361-7 /><ref name=S176-81 />\n\n==== 12th Dalai Lama ====\nIn 1856 a child was born in south [[central Tibet]] amidst all the usual extraordinary signs. He came to the notice of the search team, was investigated, passed the traditional tests and was recognised as the [[12th Dalai Lama]] in 1858. The use of the Chinese [[Golden Urn]] at the insistence of the Regent, who was later accused of being a Chinese lackey, confirmed this choice to the satisfaction of all. Renamed [[Trinley Gyatso]] and enthroned in 1860 the boy underwent 13 years of intensive tutelage and training before stepping up to rule Tibet at the age of 17.<ref name=M367>Mullin 2001, pp. 367\u2013373.</ref>\n\nHis minority seems a time of even deeper Lhasan political intrigue and power struggles than his predecessor's. By 1862 this led to a coup by Wangchuk Shetra, a minister whom the Regent had banished for conspiring against him. Shetra contrived to return, deposed the Regent, who fled to China, and seized power, appointing himself 'Desi' or Prime Minister.<ref name=M367 /> He then ruled with \"absolute power\" for three years,<ref name=S188>Shakabpa 1984, pp. 188\u20139.</ref> quelling a major rebellion in northern Kham in 1863 and re-establishing Tibetan control over significant [[Qing]]-held territory there.<ref name=Sm140>Smith 1997, p. 140.</ref> Shetra died in 1864 and the [[Kashag]] re-assumed power. The retired 76th [[Ganden Tripa]], Khyenrab Wangchuk, was appointed as 'Regent' but his role was limited to supervising and mentoring Trinley Gyatso.<ref name=M367 /><ref name=S188 />\n\nIn 1868 Shetra's coup organiser, a semi-literate [[Ganden]] monk named Palden Dondrup, seized power by another coup and ruled as a cruel despot for three years, putting opponents to death by having them 'sewn into fresh animal skins and thrown in the river'.<ref name=S188 /> In 1871, at the request of officials outraged after Dondrup had done just that with one minister and imprisoned several others, he in turn was ousted and committed suicide after a counter-coup coordinated by the supposedly powerless 'Regent' Khyenrab Wangchuk.<ref name=S188 /> As a result of this action this venerable old Regent, who died the next year, is fondly remembered by Tibetans as saviour of the Dalai Lama and the nation. The Kashag and the Tsongdu or National Assembly were re-instated, and, presided over by a Dalai Lama or his Regent, ruled without further interruption until 1959.<ref name=M367 />\n\nAccording to Smith, however, during Trinley Gyatso's minority, the Regent was deposed in 1862 for abuse of authority and closeness with China, by an alliance of monks and officials called ''Gandre Drungche'' (Ganden and Drepung Monks Assembly); this body then ruled Tibet for ten years until dissolved, when a National Assembly of monks and officials called the ''Tsongdu'' was created and took over. Smith makes no mention of Shetra or Dondrup acting as usurpers and despots in this period.<ref name=Sm140 />\n\nIn any case, Trinley Gyatso died within three years of assuming power. In 1873, at the age of 20 \"he suddenly became ill and passed away\".<ref name=M367 /> On the cause of his early death, accounts diverge. Mullin relates an interesting theory, based on cited Tibetan sources: out of concern for the monastic tradition, Trinley Gyatso chose to die and reincarnate as the [[13th Dalai Lama]], rather than taking the option of marrying a woman called Rigma Tsomo from Kokonor and leaving an heir to \"oversee Tibet's future\".<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 373\u2013375.</ref> Shakabpa on the other hand, without citing sources, notes that Trinley Gyatso was influenced and manipulated by two close acquaintances who were subsequently accused of having a hand in his fatal illness and imprisoned, tortured and exiled as a result.<ref>Shakabpa 1984, p. 191.</ref>\n\n=== 13th Dalai Lama ===\n[[File:Throne awaiting Dalai Lama's return.

Summer residence of 14th Dalai Lama, [[Nechung]], Tibet.]]\n\nThe [[13th Dalai Lama]] assumed ruling power from the monasteries, which previously had great influence on the Regent, in 1895. Due to his two periods of exile in 1904\u20131909 to escape the British invasion of 1904, and from 1910 to 1912 to escape a Chinese invasion, he became well aware of the complexities of international politics and was the first Dalai Lama to become aware of the importance of foreign relations. After his return from exile in India and [[Sikkim]] during January 1913, he assumed control of foreign relations and dealt directly with the [[Maharaja]], with the British Political officer in Sikkim and with the king of [[Nepal]] \u2013 rather than letting the Kashag or parliament do it. {{harv|Sheel|1989|pp=24, 29}}\n\nThe Thirteenth issued a Declaration of Independence for his kingdom in [[\u00dc-Tsang]] from China during the summer of 1912 and standardised a Tibetan flag, though no other sovereign state recognized Tibetan independence. {{harv|Sheel|1989|p=20}} He expelled the [[amban]]s and all Chinese civilians in the country and instituted many measures to modernise Tibet.

This ruined palace, called Tritse Marpo, was originally built around 636 AD by the founder of the [[Tibetan Empire]], [[Songtsen Gampo]] for his Nepalese wife.<ref>Shakabpa 1984, pp. 112\u2013113.</ref> Amongst the ruins there was just a small temple left where [[Tsongkhapa]] had given a teaching when he arrived in Lhasa in the 1380s.

Upon the death of the Dalai Lama and consultation with the [[Nechung Oracle]], a search for the Lama's ''yangsi'', or [[reincarnation]], is conducted. Traditionally, it has been the responsibility of the High Lamas of the [[Gelug]]pa tradition and the Tibetan government to find a person accepted as his reincarnation. The process can take around two or three years to identify the Dalai Lama, and for the 14th, [[14th Dalai Lama|Tenzin Gyatso]], it was four years before he was found. Historically, the search for the Dalai Lama has usually been limited to Tibet, though the third tulku was born in Mongolia. Tenzin Gyatso, however, has stated that he will not be reborn in the People's Republic of China, though he has also suggested he may not be reborn at all, suggesting the function of the Dalai Lama may be outdated.<ref name=\"sdpcnw\">{{cite web|title=The Dalai Lama|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/people/dalailama_1.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=17 May 2008|date=21 September 2006}}</ref> The government of the People's Republic of China has stated its intention to be the ultimate authority on the selection of the next Dalai Lama.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=China's Tensions With Dalai Lama Spill into the Afterlife|author=Buckley, Chris|date=11 March 2015|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/world/asia/chinas-tensions-with-dalai-lama-spill-into-the-afterlife.html}}</ref>\n\nThe High Lamas used several ways in which they can increase the chances of finding a person they claim to be the reincarnation. High Lamas often visit [[Lhamo La-tso]], a lake in central Tibet, and watch for a sign from the lake itself. This may be either a claimed 'vision' or some 'indication' of the direction in which to search, and this was how Tenzin Gyatso was determined to be the next Dalai Lama.\nIt is said that [[Palden Lhamo]], the female guardian spirit of the sacred lake Lhamo La-tso promised Gendun Drup, the 1st Dalai Lama, in one of his visions \"that she would protect the reincarnation lineage of the Dalai Lamas.\"<ref>Laird 2006, p. 265.</ref> Ever since the time of Gendun Gyatso, the 2nd Dalai Lama, who formalised the system, the Regents and other monks have gone to the lake to seek guidance on choosing the next reincarnation through visions while meditating there.<ref>Laird 2006, pp. 139, 264\u2013265.</ref>\n\nThe particular form of Palden Lhamo at Lhamo La-tso is Gyelmo Maksorma, \"The Victorious One who Turns Back Enemies\".

This caused Sonam Rabten who became the 5th Dalai Lama's ''changdzo'' or manager,<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 198.</ref> to seek more active Mongol patronage and military assistance for the Gelugpa while the Fifth was still a boy.<ref name=TN2 /> So, in 1620, Mongol troops allied to the Gelugpa who had camped outside Lhasa suddenly attacked and destroyed the two Tsangpa camps and drove them out of Lhasa, enabling the Dalai Lama to be brought out of hiding and publicly enthroned there in 1622.<ref name=shak101 />\n\nIn fact, throughout the 5th's minority, it was the influential and forceful Sonam Rabten who inspired the [[Dzungars|Dzungar Mongols]] to defend the Gelugpa by attacking their enemies. These enemies included other Mongol tribes who supported the Tsangpas, the Tsangpa themselves and their B\u00f6npo allies in Kham who had also opposed and persecuted Gelugpas. Ultimately, this strategy led to the destruction of the Tsangpa dynasty, the defeat of the Karmapas and their other allies and the B\u00f6npos, by armed forces from the Lhasa valley aided by their Mongol allies, paving the way for Gelugpa political and religious hegemony in Central Tibet.<ref name=SK /> Apparently by general consensus, by virtue of his position as the Dalai Lama's ''changdzo'' (chief attendant, minister), after the Dalai Lama became absolute ruler of Tibet in 1642 Sonam Rabten became the \"''Desi''\" or \"Viceroy\", in fact, the ''de facto'' regent or day-to-day ruler of Tibet's governmental affairs.

In 1648, after quelling a rebellion of Tibetans of Kansu-Xining, the Qing invited the Fifth Dalai Lama to visit their court at Beijing since they wished to engender Tibetan influence in their dealings with the Mongols. The Qing were aware the Dalai Lama had extraordinary influence with the Mongols and saw relations with the Dalai Lama as a means to facilitate submission of the [[Khalka Mongols]], traditional patrons of the [[Karma Kagyu]] sect. Similarly, since the Tibetan Gelugpa were keen to revive a [[priest-patron]] relationship with the dominant power in China and Inner Asia, the Qing invitation was accepted. After five years of complex diplomatic negotiations about whether the emperor or his representatives should meet the Dalai Lama inside or outside the Great Wall, when the meeting would be astrologically favourable, how it would be conducted and so on, it eventually took place in Beijing in 1653. The Shunzhi Emperor was then 16 years old, having in the meantime ascended the throne in 1650 after the death of Dorgon. For the Qing, although the Dalai Lama was not required to [[kowtow]] to the emperor, who rose from his throne and advanced 30 feet to meet him, the significance of the visit was that of nominal political submission by the Dalai Lama since Inner Asian heads of state did not travel to meet each other but sent envoys. For Tibetan Buddhist historians however it was interpreted as the start of an era of independent rule of the Dalai Lamas, and of Qing patronage alongside that of the Mongols.<ref>Smith 1997, pp. 108\u2013113.</ref>\n\nWhen the 5th Dalai Lama returned, he was granted by the emperor of China a golden seal of authority and golden sheets with texts written in Manchu, Tibetan and Chinese languages.<ref name=\"\u9648\u5e86\u82f12005_p41\">{{cite book |author=\u9648\u5e86\u82f1 |title=\u8fbe\u8d56\u5587\u561b\u8f6c\u4e16\u53ca\u5386\u53f2\u5b9a\u5236\u82f1 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=haMIsdC3iZwC&pg=PA41 |year=2005 |publisher=\u4e94\u6d32\u4f20\u64ad\u51fa\u7248\u793e |isbn = 978-7-5085-0745-3 |pages=41\u2013}}</ref><ref name=K309>Karmay 2014, p. 309.</ref> The 5th Dalai Lama wanted to use the golden seal of authority right away.<ref name=\"\u9648\u5e86\u82f12005_p41\" /> However, Lobzang Gyatsho noted that \"The Tibetan version of the inscription of the seal was translated by a Mongolian translator but was not a good translation\".

For example, concerning the above-mentioned 'golden seal', the Fifth Dalai Lama comments in ''Dukula'', his autobiography, on leaving China after this courtesy visit to the emperor in 1653, that \"the emperor made his men bring a golden seal for me that had three vertical lines in three parallel scripts: Chinese, Mongolian and Tibetan\". He also criticised the words carved on this gift as being faultily translated into Tibetan, writing that \"The Tibetan version of the inscription of the seal was translated by a Mongol translator but was not a good translation\".<ref name=K309/> Furthermore, when he arrived back in Tibet, he discarded the emperor's famous golden seal and made a new one for important state usage, writing in his autobiography: \"Leaving out the Chinese characters that were on the seal given by the emperor, a new seal was carved for stamping documents that dealt with territorial issues. The first imprint of the seal was offered with prayers to the image of Lokeshvara ...\".<ref>Karmay 2014, p. 402.</ref>\n\n==== Relations with the Qing dynasty ====\nThe 17th-century struggles for domination between the Manchu-led Qing dynasty and the various Mongol groups spilled over to involve Tibet because of the Fifth Dalai Lama's strong influence over the Mongols as a result of their general adoption of Tibetan Buddhism and their consequent deep loyalty to the Dalai Lama as their guru. Until 1674, the Fifth Dalai Lama had mediated in [[Dzungar people|Dzungar Mongol]] affairs whenever they required him to do so, and the [[Kangxi Emperor]], who had succeeded the Shunzhi Emperor in 1661, would accept and confirm his decisions automatically. For the Kangxi Emperor however, the alliance between the Dzungar Mongols and the Tibetans was unsettling because he feared it had the potential to unite all the other Mongol tribes together against the Qing Empire, including those tribes who had already submitted. Therefore, in 1674, the Kangxi Emperor, annoyed by the Fifth's less than full cooperation in quelling a rebellion against the Qing in [[Yunnan]], ceased deferring to him as regards Mongol affairs and started dealing with them directly.<ref name=TN6>Smith 1997, pp. 116\u2013117.</ref>\n\nIn the same year, 1674, the Dalai Lama, then at the height of his powers and conducting a foreign policy independent of the Qing, caused Mongol troops to occupy the border post of [[Dartsedo]] between Kham and Sichuan, further annoying the Kangxi Emperor who (according to Smith) already considered Tibet as part of the Qing Empire. It also increased Qing suspicion about Tibetan relations with the Mongol groups and led him to seek strategic opportunities to oppose and undermine Mongol influence in Tibet and eventually, within 50 years, to defeat the Mongols militarily and to establish the Qing as sole 'patrons and protectors' of Tibet in their place.<ref name=TN6 />\n\n==== Cultural development ====\nThe time of the Fifth Dalai Lama, who reigned from 1642 to 1682 and founded the government known as the [[Ganden Phodrang]], was a period of rich cultural development.<ref>Snellgrove & Richardson 1968, p. 197.</ref> His reign and that of [[Desi Sangye Gyatso]] are noteworthy for the upsurge in literary activity and of cultural and economic life that occurred. The same goes for the great increase in the number of foreign visitors thronging Lhasa during the period as well as for the number of inventions and institutions that are attributed to the 'Great Fifth', as the Tibetans refer to him.<ref>Stein 1972, p. 84\u20135.</ref> The most dynamic and prolific of the early Dalai Lamas, he composed more literary works than all the other Dalai Lamas combined. Writing on a wide variety of subjects he is specially noted for his works on history, classical Indian poetry in Sanskrit and his biographies of notable personalities of his epoch, as well as his own two autobiographies, one spiritual in nature and the other political (see [[Dalai Lama#Further reading|Further Reading]]).<ref name=mull83244>Mullin 1983, p. 244.</ref> He also taught and travelled extensively, reshaped the politics of Central Asia, unified Tibet, conceived and constructed the Potala Palace and is remembered for establishing systems of national medical care and education.<ref name=mull83244 />\n\n==== Death of the fifth Dalai Lama ====\nThe Fifth Dalai Lama died in 1682. Tibetan historian Nyima Gyaincain points out that the written wills from the fifth Dalai Lama before he died explicitly said his title and authority were from the Emperor of China, and he was subordinate of the Emperor of China\n.<ref name=\"\u738b\u5bb6\u4f1f\u5c3c\u739b\u575a\u8d5e1997\" />\n\nThe Fifth Dalai Lama's death in 1682 was kept secret for fifteen years by his regent [[Desi Sangye Gyatso]]. He pretended the Dalai Lama was in retreat and ruled on his behalf, secretly selecting the 6th Dalai Lama and presenting him as someone else. Tibetan historian Nyima Gyaincain points out that Desi Sangye Gyatso wanted to consolidate his personal status and power by not reporting the death of the fifth Dalai Lama to the Emperor of China, and also collude with the rebellion group of the Qing dynasty, Mongol [[Dzungar people|Dzungar]] tribe in order to counter influence from another Mongol [[Khoshut]] tribe in Tibet. Being afraid of prosecution by the Kangxi Emperor of China, Desi Sangye Gyatso explained with fear and trepidation the reason behind his action to the Emperor. In 1705, Desi Sangye Gyatso was killed by [[Lha-bzang Khan]] of the Mongol [[Khoshut]] tribe because of his actions including his illegal action of selecting the 6th Dalai Lama. Since the Kangxi Emperor was not happy about Desi Sangye Gyatso's action of not reporting, the Emperor gave [[Lha-bzang Khan]] additional title and golden seal. The Kangxi Emperor also ordered [[Lha-bzang Khan]] to arrest the 6th Dalai Lama and send him to Beijing, the 6th Dalai Lama died when he was en route to Beijing.<ref name=\"\u738b\u5bb6\u4f1f\u5c3c\u739b\u575a\u8d5e1997\" /> Journalist Thomas Laird argues that it was apparently done so that construction of the Potala Palace could be finished, and it was to prevent Tibet's neighbors, the Mongols and the Qing, from taking advantage of an interregnum in the succession of the Dalai Lamas.{{harv|Laird|2006|pp=181\u2013182}}\n\n=== 6th Dalai Lama ===\nThe [[6th Dalai Lama|Sixth Dalai Lama]] (1683\u20131706) was born near [[Tawang]], now in India, and picked out in 1685 but not enthroned until 1697 when the death of the Fifth was announced. After 16 years of study as a novice monk, in 1702 in his 20th year he rejected full ordination and gave up his monk's robes and monastic life, preferring the lifestyle of a layman.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 245\u2013256.</ref><ref>Karenina Kollmar-Paulenz, ''Kleine Geschichte Tibets'', M\u00fcnchen 2006, pp. 109\u2013122.</ref>\n\nIn 1703 G\u00fcshi Khan's ruling grandson Tenzin Wangchuk Khan was murdered by his brother [[Lha-bzang Khan|Lhazang Khan]] who usurped the Khoshut's Tibetan throne, but unlike his four predecessors he started interfering directly in Tibetan affairs in Lhasa; he opposed the Fifth Dalai Lama's regent, [[Desi Sangye Gyatso]] for his deceptions and in the same year, with the support of the Kangxi Emperor, he forced him out of office. Then in 1705, he used the Sixth's escapades as an excuse to seize full control of Tibet. Most Tibetans, though, still supported their Dalai Lama despite his behaviour and deeply resented Lhazang Khan's interference. When Lhazang was requested by the Tibetans to leave Lhasa politics to them and to retire to Kokonor like his predecessors, he quit the city, but only to gather his armies in order to return, capture Lhasa militarily and assume full political control of Tibet.<ref>Smith 1997, p. 121.</ref> The regent was then murdered by Lhazang or his wife, and, in 1706 with the compliance of the Kangxi Emperor the Sixth Dalai Lama was deposed and arrested by Lhazang who considered him to be an impostor set up by the regent. [[Lhazang Khan]], now acting as the only outright foreign ruler that Tibet had ever had, then sent him to Beijing under escort to appear before the emperor but he died mysteriously on the way near [[Lake Qinghai]], ostensibly from illness.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 260\u2013271.</ref><ref name=\"HarperCollins\">Smith 1997, p. 122.</ref>\n\nHaving discredited and deposed the Sixth Dalai Lama, whom he considered an impostor, and having removed the regent, Lhazang Khan pressed the Lhasa Gelugpa lamas to endorse a new Dalai Lama in [[Tsangyang Gyatso]]'s place as the true incarnation of the Fifth. They eventually nominated one Pekar Dzinpa, a monk but also rumored to be Lhazang's son,<ref>McKay 2003, p. 569.</ref> and Lhazang had him installed as the 'real' Sixth Dalai Lama, endorsed by the [[Panchen Lama]] and named [[Yeshe Gyatso]] in 1707.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 274.</ref> This choice was in no way accepted by the Tibetan people, however, nor by Lhazang's princely Mongol rivals in Kokonor who resented his usurpation of the [[Khoshut]] Tibetan throne as well as his meddling in Tibetan affairs. The Kangxi Emperor concurred with them, after sending investigators, initially declining to recognize [[Yeshe Gyatso]]. He did recognize him in 1710, however, after sending a Qing official party to assist Lhazang in 'restoring order'; these were the first Chinese representatives of any sort to officiate in Tibet.<ref name=\"HarperCollins\" /> At the same time, while this puppet 'Dalai Lama' had no political power, the Kangxi Emperor secured from Lhazang Khan in return for this support the promise of regular payments of tribute; this was the first time tribute had been paid to the Manchu by the Mongols in Tibet and the first overt acknowledgment of Qing supremacy over Mongol rule in Tibet.<ref>Richardson 1984, p. 48.</ref>\n\n=== 7th Dalai Lama ===\nIn 1708, in accordance with an indication given by the [[6th Dalai Lama]] when quitting Lhasa a child called Kelzang Gyatso had been born at [[Lithang]] in eastern Tibet who was soon claimed by local Tibetans to be his incarnation. After going into hiding out of fear of Lhazang Khan, he was installed in Lithang monastery. Along with some of the Kokonor Mongol princes, rivals of Lhazang, in defiance of the situation in Lhasa the Tibetans of [[Kham]] duly recognised him as the [[Seventh Dalai Lama]] in 1712, retaining his birth-name of [[Kelzang Gyatso]]. For security reasons he was moved to [[Derge]] monastery and eventually, in 1716, now also backed and sponsored by the Kangxi Emperor of China.<ref name=\"Mullin 2001, p.276-281\">Mullin 2001, p. 276\u2013281.</ref> The Tibetans asked Dzungars to bring a true Dalai Lama to Lhasa, but the Manchu Chinese did not want to release Kelsan Gyatso to the Mongol Dzungars. The Regent Taktse Shabdrung and Tibetan officials then wrote a letter to the Manchu Chinese Emperor that they recognized Kelsang Gyatso as the Dalai Lama.

Their force sent to fetch Kelzang Gyatso however was intercepted and destroyed by Qing armies alerted by Lhazang. In Lhasa, the unruly Dzungar not only failed to produce the boy but also went on the rampage, looting and destroying the holy places, abusing the populace, killing hundreds of Nyingma monks, causing chaos and bloodshed and turning their Tibetan allies against them.

On the imperial army's stately passage from [[Kumbum]] to Lhasa with the boy being welcomed adoringly at every stage, [[Khoshut]] Mongols and Tibetans were happy (and well paid) to join and swell its ranks.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 287\u20139.</ref> By the autumn of 1720 the marauding [[Dzungar people|Dzungar Mongols]] had been vanquished from Tibet and the Qing imperial forces had entered Lhasa triumphantly with the 12-year-old, acting as patrons of the Dalai Lama, liberators of Tibet, allies of the Tibetan anti-Dzungar forces led by [[Khangchenn\u00e9|Kangchenas]] and [[Polhan\u00e9 S\u00f6nam Topgy\u00e9|Polhanas]], and allies of the [[Khoshut]] Mongol princes.

Kelzang Gyatso, too young to participate in politics, studied Buddhism.

This led eventually to the murder of [[Khangchenn\u00e9|Kanchenas]] in 1727 and a civil war that was resolved in 1728 with the canny [[Pholhane|Polhanas]], who had sent for Qing assistance, the victor. When the Qing forces did arrive they punished the losers and exiled the [[Seventh Dalai Lama]] to Kham, under the pretence of sending him to Beijing, because his father had assisted the defeated, anti-Qing faction. He studied and taught Buddhism there for the next seven years.<ref>Smith 1997, pp. 129\u201330.</ref>\n\n==== Return to Lhasa ====\nIn 1735 he was allowed back to Lhasa to study and teach, but still under strict control, being mistrusted by the Qing, while [[Polhan\u00e9 S\u00f6nam Topgy\u00e9|Polhanas]] ruled [[Central Tibet]] under nominal Qing supervision. Meanwhile, the Qing had promoted the [[Fifth Panchen Lama]] to be a rival leader and reinstated the ''ambans'' and the Lhasa garrison. Polhanas died in 1747 and was succeeded by his son [[Gyurme Namgyal]], the last dynastic ruler of Tibet, who was far less cooperative with the Qing. On the contrary, he built a Tibetan army and started conspiring with the Dzungars to rid Tibet of Qing influence.<ref>Shakabpa 1967, pp. 147\u20138.</ref> In 1750, when the ''ambans'' realised this, they invited him and personally assassinated him and then, despite the Dalai Lama's attempts to calm the angered populace a vengeful Tibetan mob assassinated the ''ambans'' in turn, along with most of their escort.<ref>Smith 1997, p. 130\u2013132.</ref>\n\n==== Restoration as Tibet's political leader ====\nThe Qing sent yet another force 'to restore order' but when it arrived the situation had already been stabilised under the leadership of the [[7th Dalai Lama]] who was now seen to have demonstrated loyalty to the Qing. Just as G\u00fcshi Khan had done with the Fifth Dalai Lama, they therefore helped reconstitute the government with the Dalai Lama presiding over a [[Kashag]] of four Tibetans, reinvesting him with temporal power in addition to his already established spiritual leadership. This arrangement, with a Kashag under the Dalai Lama or his regent, outlasted the Qing dynasty which collapsed in 1912.<ref>Van Schaik 2011, p. 144; Shakabpa 1967, p. 150.</ref> The ''ambans'' and their garrison were also reinstated to observe and to some extent supervise affairs, however, although their influence generally waned with the power of their empire which gradually declined after 1792 along with its influence over Tibet, a decline aided by a succession of corrupt or incompetent ''ambans''.<ref>Smith 1997, p. 137.</ref> Moreover, there was soon no reason for the Qing to fear the [[Dzungar people|Dzungar]]; by the time the [[Seventh Dalai Lama]] died in 1757 at the age of 49, the entire [[Dzungar people]] had been practically exterminated through years of genocidal campaigns by Qing armies, and deadly smallpox epidemics, with the survivors being forcibly transported into China. Their emptied lands were then awarded to other peoples.<ref>Smith 1997, p. 132\u20133.</ref>\n\nAccording to Mullin, despite living through such violent times Kelzang Gyatso was perhaps 'the most spiritually learned and accomplished of any Dalai Lama', his written works comprising several hundred titles including 'some of Tibet's finest spiritual literary achievements'.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 302, p. 308.</ref> In addition, despite his apparent lack of zeal in politics, Kelzang Gyatso is credited with establishing in 1751 the reformed government of Tibet headed by the Dalai Lama, which continued over 200 years until the 1950s, and then in exile.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 303.</ref> Construction of the [[Norbulingka]], the 'Summer Palace' of the Dalai Lamas in Lhasa was also started during Kelzang Gyatso's reign.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Suhasini Haidar|title=At Lhasa, Tibetans still pray for Dalai Lama's return|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world/at-lhasa-tibetans-still-pray-for-dalai-lamas-return/article6367393.ece|accessdate=19 July 2015|newspaper=The Hindu|date=1 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Introduction to The Potala Palace, Jokhang Temple and Norbulingka, Tibet|url=http://worldheritage.routes.travel/world-heritage-site/the-potala-palace-jokhang-temple-and-norbulingka-tibet/|publisher=World Heritage|accessdate=19 July 2015|quote=Norbulingka was built in the 1700s by the seventh Dalai Lama and served as the regular dwelling of future Dalai Lamas.

According to Mullin, the [[14th Dalai Lama]] has pointed to certain indications that [[Jamphel Gyatso]] might not have been the incarnation of the [[7th Dalai Lama]] but of Jamyang Chojey, a disciple of [[Tsongkhapa]] and founder of Drepung monastery who was also reputed to be an incarnation of [[Avalokiteshvara]]. In any case, he mainly lived a quiet and unassuming life as a devoted and studious monk, uninvolved in the kind of dramas that had surrounded his predecessors.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 323\u20137.</ref>\n\nNevertheless, [[Jamphel Gyatso]] was also said to possess all the signs of being the true incarnation of the [[Seventh Dalai Lama|Seventh]]. This was also claimed to have been confirmed by many portents clear to the Tibetans and so, in 1762, at the age of 5, he was duly enthroned as the [[Eighth Dalai Lama]] at the [[Potala Palace]].<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 328\u2013332.</ref> At the age of 23 he was persuaded to assume the throne as ruler of Tibet with a [[Regent]] to assist him and after three years of this, when the Regent went to Beijing as ambassador in 1784, he continued to rule solo for a further four years. Feeling unsuited to worldly affairs, however, and unhappy in this role, he then retired from public office to concentrate on religious activities for his remaining 16 years until his death in 1804.<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 333\u20134.</ref> He is also credited with the construction of the [[Norbulingka]] 'Summer Palace' started by his predecessor in Lhasa and with ordaining some ten thousand monks in his efforts to foster monasticism.<ref>Mullin 2001 pp. 338\u20139.</ref>\n\n=== 9th to 12th Dalai Lamas ===\nHugh Richardson's summary of the period covering the four short-lived, 19th-century Dalai Lamas:\n{{quote|After him [the [[8th Dalai Lama]], Jamphel Gyatso], the [[9th Dalai Lama|9th]] and [[10th Dalai Lama]]s died before attaining their majority: one of them is credibly stated to have been murdered and strong suspicion attaches to the other. The [[11th Dalai Lama|11th]] and [[12th Dalai Lama|12th]] were each enthroned but died soon after being invested with power. For 113 years, therefore, supreme authority in Tibet was in the hands of a Lama Regent, except for about two years when a lay noble held office and for short periods of nominal rule by the 11th and 12th Dalai Lamas.{{efn|According to Mullin, Smith and Shakabpa however, the 12th Dalai Lama's Regent, Reting Rinpoche, was deposed in 1862 in a coup by Gyalpo Shetra and Tibet was ruled by despots or assemblies of abbots and ministers for the next eleven years, that is until 1873 when the 12th Dalai Lama assumed power.}}<br />It has sometimes been suggested that this state of affairs was brought about by the Ambans\u2014the Imperial Residents in Tibet\u2014because it would be easier to control the Tibet through a Regent than when a Dalai Lama, with his absolute power, was at the head of the government. That is not true. The regular ebb and flow of events followed its set course. The Imperial Residents in Tibet, after the first flush of zeal in 1750, grew less and less interested and efficient. Tibet was, to them, exile from the urbanity and culture of Peking; and so far from dominating the Regents, the Ambans allowed themselves to be dominated. It was the ambition and greed for power of Tibetans that led to five successive Dalai Lamas being subjected to continuous tutelage. {{harv|Richardson|1984|pp=59\u201360}}}}\n\n[[Thubten Jigme Norbu]], the elder brother of the 14th Dalai Lama, described these unfortunate events as follows, although there are few, if any, indications that any of the four were said to be 'Chinese-appointed imposters':\n{{quote|It is perhaps more than a coincidence that between the seventh and the thirteenth holders of that office, only one reached his majority. The eighth, Gyampal Gyatso, died when he was in his thirties, Lungtog Gyatso when he was eleven, Tsultrim Gyatso at eighteen, Khadrup Gyatso when he was eighteen also, and Krinla Gyatso at about the same age. The circumstances are such that it is very likely that some, if not all, were poisoned, either by loyal Tibetans for being Chinese-appointed impostors, or by the Chinese for not being properly manageable. Many Tibetans think that this was done at the time when the young [Dalai Lama] made his ritual visit to the Lake Lhamtso. ... Each of the four [Dalai Lamas] to die young expired shortly after his visit to the lake. Many said it was because they were not the true reincarnations, but imposters imposed by the Chinese. Others tell stories of how the cooks of the retinue, which in those days included many Chinese, were bribed to put poison in the [Dalai Lama's] food. The 13th [Dalai Lama] did not visit Lhamtso until he was 25 years old. He was adequately prepared by spiritual exercise and he also had faithful cooks. The Chinese were disappointed when he did not die like his predecessors, and he was to live long enough to give them much more cause for regret.{{harv|Norbu|Turnbull|1968|pp.=311\u2013312}}{{efn|According to their biographies, the [[8th Dalai Lama|Eighth, Jamphel Gyatso]] lived to 46 years old, the [[9th Dalai Lama|Ninth, Lungtok Gyatso]] to 9 years, the [[10th Dalai Lama|Tenth, Tsultrim Gyatso]] to 21, the [[Khedrup Gyatso|Eleventh, Khedrup Gyatso]] to 17 and the [[Trinley Gyatso|Twelfth, Trinley Gyatso]] to 18.}}}}\n\nAccording to Mullin, on the other hand, it is improbable that the [[Manchus]] would have murdered any of these four for being 'unmanageable' since it would have been in their best interests to have strong Dalai Lamas ruling in Lhasa, he argues, agreeing with [[Hugh Edward Richardson|Richardson]] that it was rather \"the ambition and greed for power of Tibetans\" that might have caused the Lamas' early deaths.{{efn|Considering what occurred in Lhasa after the Chinese ''ambans'' murdered [[Gyurme Namgyal]] in 1750, however, the Manchus would have been particularly reluctant to murder a Dalai Lama.}} Further, if Tibetan nobles murdered any of them, it would more likely have been in order to protect or enhance their family interests rather than out of suspicion that the Dalai Lamas were seen as Chinese-appointed imposters as suggested by Norbu. They could also have died from illnesses, possibly contracted from diseases to which they had no immunity, carried to Lhasa by the multitudes of pilgrims visiting from nearby countries for blessings. Finally, from the Buddhist point of view, Mullin says, \"Simply stated, these four Dalai Lamas died young because the world did not have enough good karma to deserve their presence\".<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 343\u20136.</ref>\n\nTibetan historian K. Dhondup, however, in his history ''The Water-Bird and Other Years'', based on the Tibetan minister Surkhang Sawang Chenmo's historical manuscripts,<ref>Dhondup 1986, p. iv.</ref> disagrees with Mullin's opinion that having strong Dalai Lamas in power in Tibet would have been in China's best interests. He notes that many historians are compelled to suspect Manchu foul play in these serial early deaths because the Ambans had such latitude to interfere; the Manchu, he says, \"''to perpetuate their domination over Tibetan affairs, did not desire a Dalai Lama who will ascend the throne and become a strong and capable ruler over his own country and people''\". The life and deeds of the 13th Dalai Lama [in successfully upholding ''de facto'' Tibetan independence from China from 1912 to 1950] serve as the living proof of this argument, he points out.<ref>Dhondup 1986, p. 3.</ref> This account also corresponds with TJ Norbu's observations above.\n\nFinally, while acknowledging the possibility, the [[14th Dalai Lama]] himself doubts they were poisoned. He ascribes the probable cause of these early deaths to negligence, foolishness and lack of proper medical knowledge and attention. \"''Even today''\" he is quoted as saying, \"''when people get sick, some [Tibetans] will say: 'Just do your prayers, you don't need medical treatment.'''\"<ref>Laird 2006, p. 197.</ref>\n\n==== 9th Dalai Lama ====\nBorn in Kham in 1805/6 amidst the usual miraculous signs the [[9th Dalai Lama|Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso]] was appointed by the [[7th Panchen Lama]]'s search team at the age of two and enthroned in the Potala in 1808 at an impressive ceremony attended by representatives from China, Mongolia, Nepal and Bhutan.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 346\u20138.</ref><ref>Shakabpa 1984, p. 172.</ref> Tibetan historian Nyima Gyaincain and Wang Jiawei point out that the 9th Dalai Lama was allowed to use the seal of authority given to the late 8th Dalai Lama by the Emperor of China<ref name=\"Wang\u5c3c\u739b\u575a\u8d5e1997_p71\">{{cite book|author1=Jiawei Wang|author2=\u5c3c\u739b\u575a\u8d5e|title=The Historical Status of China's Tibet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ak3SQTVS7acC&pg=PA71|year=1997|publisher=\u4e94\u6d32\u4f20\u64ad\u51fa\u7248\u793e|isbn=978-7-80113-304-5|pages=71\u2013}}</ref>\n\nHis second Regent Demo Tulku was the biographer of the 8th and 9th Dalai Lamas and though the 9th died at the age of 9 his biography is as lengthy as those of many of the early Dalai Lamas.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 348.</ref> In 1793 under Manchu pressure Tibet had closed its borders to foreigners,<ref>Shakabpa 1984, p. 173.</ref><ref>Richardson 1984, p. 71.</ref> but in 1811 a British Sinologist, [[Thomas Manning (sinologist)|Thomas Manning]] became the first Englishman to visit Lhasa.

After that he was immersed in religious studies under the Panchen Lama, amongst other great masters. Meanwhile, there were court intrigues and ongoing power struggles taking place between the various Lhasa factions, the Regent, the [[Kashag]], the powerful nobles and the abbots and monks of the three great monasteries. The Tsemonling Regent<ref>[http://treasuryoflives.org/biographies/view/Trichen-73-Ngawang-Jampel-Tsultrim-Gyatso/6979|The Second Tsemonling, Ngawang Jampel Tsultrim Gyatso]</ref> became mistrusted and was forcibly deposed, there were machinations, plots, beatings and kidnappings of ministers and so forth, resulting at last in the Panchen Lama being appointed as interim Regent to keep the peace. Eventually the Third Reting Rinpoche was made Regent, and in 1855, Khedrup Gyatso, appearing to be an extremely promising prospect, was requested to take the reins of power at the age of 17.

The respected Reting Rinpoche was recalled once again to act as Regent and requested to lead the search for the next incarnation, the twelfth.<ref name=M361-7 /><ref name=S176-81 />\n\n==== 12th Dalai Lama ====\nIn 1856 a child was born in south [[central Tibet]] amidst all the usual extraordinary signs. He came to the notice of the search team, was investigated, passed the traditional tests and was recognised as the [[12th Dalai Lama]] in 1858. The use of the Chinese [[Golden Urn]] at the insistence of the Regent, who was later accused of being a Chinese lackey, confirmed this choice to the satisfaction of all. Renamed [[Trinley Gyatso]] and enthroned in 1860 the boy underwent 13 years of intensive tutelage and training before stepping up to rule Tibet at the age of 17.<ref name=M367>Mullin 2001, pp. 367\u2013373.</ref>\n\nHis minority seems a time of even deeper Lhasan political intrigue and power struggles than his predecessor's. By 1862 this led to a coup by Wangchuk Shetra, a minister whom the Regent had banished for conspiring against him. Shetra contrived to return, deposed the Regent, who fled to China, and seized power, appointing himself 'Desi' or Prime Minister.<ref name=M367 /> He then ruled with \"absolute power\" for three years,<ref name=S188>Shakabpa 1984, pp. 188\u20139.</ref> quelling a major rebellion in northern Kham in 1863 and re-establishing Tibetan control over significant [[Qing]]-held territory there.<ref name=Sm140>Smith 1997, p. 140.</ref> Shetra died in 1864 and the [[Kashag]] re-assumed power. The retired 76th [[Ganden Tripa]], Khyenrab Wangchuk, was appointed as 'Regent' but his role was limited to supervising and mentoring Trinley Gyatso.<ref name=M367 /><ref name=S188 />\n\nIn 1868 Shetra's coup organiser, a semi-literate [[Ganden]] monk named Palden Dondrup, seized power by another coup and ruled as a cruel despot for three years, putting opponents to death by having them 'sewn into fresh animal skins and thrown in the river'.<ref name=S188 /> In 1871, at the request of officials outraged after Dondrup had done just that with one minister and imprisoned several others, he in turn was ousted and committed suicide after a counter-coup coordinated by the supposedly powerless 'Regent' Khyenrab Wangchuk.<ref name=S188 /> As a result of this action this venerable old Regent, who died the next year, is fondly remembered by Tibetans as saviour of the Dalai Lama and the nation. The Kashag and the Tsongdu or National Assembly were re-instated, and, presided over by a Dalai Lama or his Regent, ruled without further interruption until 1959.<ref name=M367 />\n\nAccording to Smith, however, during Trinley Gyatso's minority, the Regent was deposed in 1862 for abuse of authority and closeness with China, by an alliance of monks and officials called ''Gandre Drungche'' (Ganden and Drepung Monks Assembly); this body then ruled Tibet for ten years until dissolved, when a National Assembly of monks and officials called the ''Tsongdu'' was created and took over. Smith makes no mention of Shetra or Dondrup acting as usurpers and despots in this period.<ref name=Sm140 />\n\nIn any case, Trinley Gyatso died within three years of assuming power. In 1873, at the age of 20 \"he suddenly became ill and passed away\".<ref name=M367 /> On the cause of his early death, accounts diverge. Mullin relates an interesting theory, based on cited Tibetan sources: out of concern for the monastic tradition, Trinley Gyatso chose to die and reincarnate as the [[13th Dalai Lama]], rather than taking the option of marrying a woman called Rigma Tsomo from Kokonor and leaving an heir to \"oversee Tibet's future\".<ref>Mullin 2001, pp. 373\u2013375.</ref> Shakabpa on the other hand, without citing sources, notes that Trinley Gyatso was influenced and manipulated by two close acquaintances who were subsequently accused of having a hand in his fatal illness and imprisoned, tortured and exiled as a result.<ref>Shakabpa 1984, p. 191.</ref>\n\n=== 13th Dalai Lama ===\n[[File:Throne awaiting Dalai Lama's return. Summer residence Nechung. 1993.JPG|upright|thumb|Throne awaiting Dalai Lama's return. Summer residence of 14th Dalai Lama, [[Nechung]], Tibet.]]\n\nThe [[13th Dalai Lama]] assumed ruling power from the monasteries, which previously had great influence on the Regent, in 1895. Due to his two periods of exile in 1904\u20131909 to escape the British invasion of 1904, and from 1910 to 1912 to escape a Chinese invasion, he became well aware of the complexities of international politics and was the first Dalai Lama to become aware of the importance of foreign relations. After his return from exile in India and [[Sikkim]] during January 1913, he assumed control of foreign relations and dealt directly with the [[Maharaja]], with the British Political officer in Sikkim and with the king of [[Nepal]] \u2013 rather than letting the Kashag or parliament do it. {{harv|Sheel|1989|pp=24, 29}}\n\nThe Thirteenth issued a Declaration of Independence for his kingdom in [[\u00dc-Tsang]] from China during the summer of 1912 and standardised a Tibetan flag, though no other sovereign state recognized Tibetan independence. {{harv|Sheel|1989|p=20}} He expelled the [[amban]]s and all Chinese civilians in the country and instituted many measures to modernise Tibet. These included provisions to curb excessive demands on peasants for provisions by the monasteries and tax evasion by the nobles, setting up an independent police force, the abolition of the death penalty, extension of secular education, and the provision of electricity throughout the city of Lhasa in the 1920s. {{harv|Norbu|Turnbull|1968|pp=317\u2013318}} He died in 1933.\n\n=== 14th Dalai Lama ===\nThe [[14th Dalai Lama]] was born on 6 July 1935 on a straw mat in a cowshed to a farmer's family in a remote part of Tibet.<ref>Laird 2006, p. 261.</ref> According to most Western journalistic sources<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sturcke|first1=James|title=Dalai Lama defies China over successor|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/27/china.jamessturcke|accessdate=29 June 2017|agency=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Nagle|first1=Jeanne|title=The Dalai Lama: Spiritual Leader of the Tibetan People|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9I0gBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT9&lpg=PT9&dq=dalai+lama+family+humble+origins#v=onepage&q=dalai%20lama%20family%20humble%20origins&f=false|accessdate=29 June 2017|isbn=9781622754410|date=15 July 2014}}</ref> he was born into a humble family of farmers as one of 16 children.<ref name=\"Committee2008\">{{cite book|author=Great Britain: Parliament: House of Commons: Foreign Affairs Committee|title=Human Rights Annual Report 2007: Ninth Report of Session 2007\u201308, Report, Together with Formal Minutes, Oral and Written Evidence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7dJbld9PzQC&pg=PA124|date=20 July 2008|publisher=The Stationery Office|isbn=978-0-215-52193-4|pages=124\u2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=\u7d71\u4e00\u8ad6\u58c7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ymhKAQAAIAAJ|year=2008|publisher=\u7d71\u4e00\u8ad6\u58c7\u96dc\u8a8c\u793e}} |quote=\u636e\u7edf\u8ba1,\u6c11\u4e3b\u6539\u9769\u524d,\u5341\u56db\u4e16\u8fbe\u8d56\u5587\u561b\u5bb6\u65cf\u5728\u897f\u85cf\u5360\u6709 27 \u5ea7\u5e84\u56ed\u3001 30 \u4e2a\u7267\u573a,\u62e5\u6709\u519c\n\u7267\u5974 6000 \u591a\u4eba</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=\u5341\u56db\u4e16\u8fbe\u8d56\u5587\u561b|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=etOVRV2Lr6oC&pg=PA23|year=1977|isbn = 9787801132987|author1 = \u53f8\u4ec1|author2 = \u683c\u65fa}} |quote=\u62c9\u8428\u897f\u531750\u516c\u91cc\u5904\u7684\u5806\u9f99\u5fb7\u5e86\u53bf\u8272\u6751\uff0c\u6c11\u4e3b\u6539\u9769\u524d\u662f\u5341\u56db\u4e16\u8fbe\u8d56\u5587\u561b\u5bb6\u7684\u5e84\u56ed\u3002\u5f53\u65f6\u5e84\u56e9\u91cc20\u6237\u5dee\u5df4(\u519c\u5974)\u3002</ref> The 14th Dalai Lama had become the joint most popular world leader by 2013, (tied with Barack Obama), according to a poll conducted by [[Harris Insights & Analytics|Harris Interactive]] of New York, which sampled public opinion in the US and six major European countries.<ref name=Harrispoll>{{cite web|author1=Regina A.

[[Plato]] articulated the legend of [[Atlantis]].  Ancient writers like [[Plutarch]], [[Strabo]] and, more explicitly, [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Ptolemy]], testified to the real existence of the [[Canary Islands]].\n\nThe Middle Ages saw the emergence of a new set of legends about islands deep in the Atlantic Ocean.  These were sourced in various places, e.g. the Irish ''[[immram]]a'', or missionary sailing voyages (such as the tales of [[The Voyage of the U\u00ed Chorra|Ui Corra]] and [[Saint Brendan]]<ref>Babcock (1922: Ch. 3)</ref>) and the sagas of [[Norsemen|Norse]] adventurers (such as the [[Gr\u0153nlendinga saga]] and the [[saga of Erik the Red]]).  The peoples of the [[Iberian peninsula]], who were closest to the real Atlantic islands, and whose seafarers and fisherman may have seen and even visited them,<ref>Already both [[Plutarch]] (''Life of Sertorius'') and [[Pliny the Elder]] report that fishermen from Gades ([[Cadiz]]) routinely visited Atlantic islands to the southwest.</ref> articulated their own tales.  Medieval [[Al-Andalus|Andalus]]ian [[Arab]]s related stories of Atlantic island encounters in the legend of the 9th-century navigator [[Khashkhash Ibn Saeed Ibn Aswad|Khashkhash]] of Cordoba (told by [[al-Masudi]])<ref>Beazley (1897: vol.1, [https://archive.org/details/dawnmoderngeogr01beazgoog/page/n525 p.465])</ref> and the 12th-century story of the eight ''Maghurin'' (Wanderers) of Lisbon (told by [[al-Idrisi]]).<ref>Beazley (1906: vol. 3, [https://books.google.com/books?id=64MYAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA532#v=onepage&q&f=false p.532]). Cortes\u00e3o (1954 (1975))</ref>\n\nFrom these Greek, Irish, Norse, Arab and Iberian seafaring tales \u2013 often cross-fertilizing each other \u2013 emerged a myriad of [[phantom island|mythical island]]s in the Atlantic Ocean \u2013 [[Atlantis]], the [[Fortunate Islands]], [[Saint Brendan's Island]], [[Brasil (mythical island)|Brasil Island]], [[Antillia]] (or ''Sete Cidades'', the island of the Seven Cities), [[Satanazes]], the ''Ilhas Azuis'' (Blue Islands), the ''Terra dos Bacalhaus'' (Land of Codfish), and so on, which however uncertain, became so ubiquitous that they were considered fact.\n\nAccording to [[Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas]], two dead bodies that looked like those of Amerindians were found on [[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores]]. He said he found that fact in [[Christopher Columbus]]' notes, and it was one reason why Columbus presumed that India was on the other side of the ocean.<ref>De Las Casas, Bartolom\u00e9; [[Anthony Pagden|Pagden, Anthony]] (8 September 1999). ''A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indias''. New York: Penguin Books. {{ISBN|0-14-044562-5}}.</ref>\n\nIn ''A History of the Azores'', written by [[Thomas Ashe]] in 1813, the author talks of the discovery of the islands by Joshua Vander Berg of [[Bruges]],<ref name=\"History1813\">{{cite book|first=Thomas|last=Ashe|title=History of the Azores, or. Western islands|year=1813|publisher=Oxford University}}</ref>  who landed there during a storm on his way to [[Lisbon]]. This claim is generally discredited among academics today.  As were local stories of a mysterious equestrian statue and [[Carthaginian coins of Corvo|coins with Carthaginian writing]] that were purportedly discovered on island of Corvo, or the strange inscriptions found along the coast of Quatro Ribeiras (on Terceira): all unsubstantiated stories that supported the claims of human visitation to the islands before the official record.\n\nBut there was some basis in fact, since the Medici maps of 1351 contained seven islands off the Portuguese coast which were arranged in groups of three; there were the southern group, or the Goat Islands (Cabreras), the middle group, or the Wind or Dove Islands (De Ventura Sive de Columbis), and the western islands, or the Brazil Island (De Brazil).  The [[Atlas Catalan]] (of 1375) also identifies three islands with the names of Corvo, Flores, and S\u00e3o Jorge, and it was thought that maybe the Genovese had discovered the Azores, and given them those names. But, generally, these stories highlighted that sightings were being made at the end of the 14th century, or at least, the peoples of Europe had a passing knowledge of islands in the Atlantic. Owing to the disorganized politics of the continent there were few nations able to organize an exploration of the Western Sea.\n\nThere have been recent discoveries (2010\u20132011) of [[Hypogeum|Hypogea]] (structures carved into embankments, that may have been used for burials) on the islands of Corvo, Santa Maria and Terceira, that might allude to a human presence on the islands before the Portuguese.<ref>These archaeological sites were first identified by Nuno Ribeiro (in 2010) during archeological visits to Corvo and Terceira, but further examination and dating were required to authenticate their validity</ref><ref>{{citation|publisher=Correio da Manh\u00e3|language=Portuguese|accessdate=18 June 2011|title=Estruturas podem ter mais de dois mil anos: Monumentos funer\u00e1rios descobertos nos A\u00e7ores|date=5 March 2011|location=Lisbon, Portugal|editor=J.M.A.|author=Lusa|url=http://www.cmjornal.xl.pt/detalhe/noticias/ultima-hora/monumentos-funerarios-descobertos-nos-acores}}</ref><ref name=\"AO\">{{citation|publisher=A\u00e7oreana Oriental|language=Portuguese|accessdate=27 June 2011|title=Estudos arqueol\u00f3gicos podem indicar presen\u00e7a pr\u00e9via ao povoamento das ilhas|date=27 June 2011|location=Ponta Delgada (Azores), Portugal|editor=A.O.

The first map to depict the Azores was the [[Medici Atlas]] (1351). Its depiction was subsequently replicated in the [[Pizzigani brothers]] map of 1367, the [[Catalan Atlas]] (1375), the [[Pinelli\u2013Walckenaer Atlas]] (1384), the [[Corbitis Atlas]] (c. 1385\u20131410), the charts of [[Guillem Soler]] (1380, 1385), [[Mecia de Viladestes]] (1413) and others.<ref>Amat di S. Filippo (1892: [https://books.google.com/books?id=-vM6AQAAIAAJ&pg=PA534#v=onepage&q&f=false p.534]); \nMees (1901: [https://archive.org/details/histoiredeladco00meesgoog/page/n145 p.140]).  Marcel (1887: [https://books.google.com/books?id=xXk9AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA31#v=onepage&q&f=false p.31]) suggests it may have already been hinted at in the [[Angelino Dulcert]] (1339) map, under the names St. Brendan, Primaria sive puellarum, Capraria and Canaria.\n</ref> They are also listed in the ''[[Libro del Conoscimiento]]'' (c. 1380).<ref>''Libro de Conoscimiento'' (1877 ed.: [https://books.google.com/books?id=0lMEEgk1U-kC&pg=PA50#v=onepage&q&f=false p.50])</ref>\n\nIn these maps, the Azores are usually depicted vertically aligned, on a north\u2013south axis, nine islands in three clusters.  The island names, in order (from south to north) are usually (with their tentative translation):\n\nbottom cluster:\n* ''lovo'' or ''lobo'' (\"island of wolves\" (seals?), [[Santa Maria Island (Azores)|Santa Maria]])\n* ''caprara'' or ''cabrera'' (\"island of goats\", [[S\u00e3o Miguel Island|S\u00e3o Miguel]]),\nmiddle cluster:\n* ''y de brazil'' (\"island of embers/fire\", [[Terceira Island|Terceira]])\n* ''li columbi'' (\"island of pigeons\", [[Pico Island|Pico]])\n* ''y de la ventura'' (\"island of venture/winds\",  [[Faial Island|Faial]])\n* ''san zorzo'' (\"island of St. George\", [[S\u00e3o Jorge Island|S\u00e3o Jorge]])\ntop cluster:\n* ''li conigi'' (\"island of rabbits\", [[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores]])\n* ''y de corvis marinis'' (\"island of sea crows\", [[Corvo Island|Corvo]])\n\nIt is notable that two of the names \u2013 ''San Zorzo'' and ''Corvis Marinis'' \u2013 would be transferred to the modern Azorean islands.  Only [[Graciosa Island|Graciosa]] seems to be routinely missing on these maps. The [[Madeira]] archipelago also appears on most of these same maps, with their modern names:  ''legname'' ([[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]] for \"wood\", [[Madeira]]), ''porto sancto'' ([[Porto Santo]]), ''desertas'' ([[Desertas]]) and ''salvazes'' ([[Savage Islands|Savage Island]]).\n\nThe source of this information is a mystery. It could simply be derived from pure legend, possibly of [[al-Andalus|Andalusian]] Arab origin e.g. [[al-Idrisi]] speaks of an Atlantic island of wild goats (the Caprera?) and another of \"cormorants\", a scavenger bird (the \"sea crows\" of Corvis Marinis?)<ref>Babcock, [https://archive.org/details/legendaryisland00babcgoog/page/n136 p.166]</ref>  But outside their erroneous axial tilt, the Azores do seem clustered with reasonable accuracy. From this cartographic record, there seems little doubt that both Madeira and the Azores were discovered, or at least sighted, during the 14th century, well before their official discovery dates.<ref>Cortes\u00e3o (1954 (1975):[https://books.google.com/books?id=2PbNS0LHn60C&lpg=PP1&pg=RA1-PA82#v=onepage&q&f=false p.82]); Cortes\u00e3o (1969: p.67)</ref>\n\nOne (unproven) hypothesis is that the Azores were discovered in the course of a mapping expedition in 1341 to the [[Canary Islands]], sponsored by King [[Afonso IV of Portugal]], and commanded by the Florentine [[Angiolino del Tegghia de Corbizzi]] and the Genoese [[Nicoloso da Recco]].<ref>The 1341 expedition is related by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] \"De Canaria et insula reliquis, ultra Ispaniam, in occeano noviter repertis\" (repr. in ''Monumenta Henricina'', vol. I, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JL_IU1hpmsIC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA389#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 202\u201306.])</ref>  Although not quite described in the 1341 report, Madeira and the Azores might nonetheless have been seen from a distance on the expedition's return via a long sailing arc (''[[volta do mar]]'') from the Canary islands.<ref>De la Ronci\u00e8re (1925: p.4ff.); Magalh\u00e3es Godinho (1962: p.30); Cortes\u00e3o (1954 (1975):[https://books.google.com/books?id=2PbNS0LHn60C&lpg=PP1&pg=RA1-PA90#v=onepage&q&f=falsep.90-91])</ref> \n\nEven if they were not discovered by the mapping expedition of 1341 itself, the islands may have been found by any of the numerous [[Kingdom of Majorca|Majorcan]] expeditions that were launched into the Atlantic Ocean in the aftermath, destined for slaving runs on the newly mapped Canary islands.<ref>Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto (2007)</ref> Regardless of who sighted them during the 14th century, there seems to have been no follow-ons until the 15th century.\n\n=== Portuguese exploration ===\n\n[[File:EdwardWright-MapforSailingtoAzores-1599.jpg|thumb|235px|left| English mathematician and cartographer [[Edward Wright (mathematician)|Edward Wright]]'s map \"for sailing to the Isles of Azores\", showing loxodromes or rhumb lines]] In the late 14th century, many maps appeared showing fictitious islands in the Atlantic. In this period, expanding commercial contacts linked the Mediterranean with communities along the Atlantic coast. In particular, [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]], [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]], and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] traders were active, and also religious groups seeking converts to Christianity. This expansion placed the Kingdom of Portugal in a strategic position. The seafaring Portuguese were eager to expand their realm and their influence.\n\nIn this context, [[Prince Henry the Navigator]] (1394\u20131460) had an important role. He added his own financial support to the efforts of  the Portuguese crown. He financed the construction of new ships, and established naval schools to harness seafaring knowledge and promote new technologies and their use. Prince Henry is generally credited with motivating modern navigation and directing discoveries during the age of exploration; for Azoreans he is one of their founding fathers.\n\nPrince Henry hoped to establish communication by sea with [[India]] and the legendary realm of [[Prester John]], thereby outflanking the hostile [[Islam|Muslim]] states in northern Africa and the [[Holy Land]]. He was Grand Master of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Military Order of Christ]], whose program of exploration, discovery, and settlement was tailored for this dual purpose.\n\nPrince Henry experimented with ships, navigational instruments, and maps, developing techniques that made oceanic travel possible. The Portuguese Atlantic islands were not unknown; a growing body of documents had shown that the islands were known to sailors. But most important, in the words of Prince Henry's personal chronicler, is that the Prince \"ordered [Portuguese navigators and captains] to find the islands\", rather than just sending his fleets into the unknown to discover what they could.\n\n===The re-discovery===\nThe exact date of this re-discovery of the Atlantic islands is not clear, though historical accounts indicate that the islands of [[Santa Maria Island (Azores)|Santa Maria]] and [[S\u00e3o Miguel Island|S\u00e3o Miguel]] were the first to be discovered by navigator [[Diogo de Silves]] around 1427.\n\nOne fact often debated is the origin of the name \"Azores\" used to identify the archipelago.  By 1492, in the globe of [[Martin Behaim]], the eastern and central group of islands were referred to as '''''Insulae Azore''''' (\"Islands of the Azores\"), while the islands of western group were called the '''''Insulae Flores''''' (\"Islands of Flowers\"). Similarly, older nautical charts had identified them as the '''''Ilhas Afortunadas''''' (\"The Fortunate Islands\") or '''''Ilhas de S\u00e3o Brand\u00e3o''''' (\"The Islands of Saint Brendan\").  The use of mythical names in local naming became a theme; in S\u00e3o Miguel and Pico there are communities called '''''Sete Cidades''''', on Terceira, a peninsula along the southern coast is referred to as Monte Brasil, and the name Mosteiros is used on both islands of S\u00e3o Miguel and Flores.  There are also many examples of re-using names from island to island (for example, Cedros, S\u00e3o Pedro, Feteiras, or Calheta). Three theories have developed about the naming of the archipelago.\n\n* The classical theory attributes the naming to the presence of [[diurnality|diurnal]] [[birds of prey]] (some say [[Accipiter|goshawks]], while others species of [[Accipitridae|eagles]]), identified by Portuguese sailors at the time of discovery. But this theory has been discredited. The only bird of prey that nests in the archipelago is the [[common buzzard]] (''Buteo buteo rothschildi''), which was introduced during the period of colonization and settlement. Sailors may have confused existing migratory birds for such birds of prey, or used colloquial names and attributed them to these species, or some bird of prey species was present that became extinct since colonization;\n* The naming of the islands may have been an homage by the discoverer [[Gon\u00e7alo Velho Cabral]] to Santa Maria of A\u00e7ores, patron saint of the parish of A\u00e7ores, in the municipality of [[Celorico da Beira]], District of [[Guarda District|Guarda]].\n* \"Azores\" may have been a Portuguese variant of the [[Genoa|Genovese]] or [[Florence|Florentine]] word '''''azzurre''''' or '''''azzorre''''' (\"blue\") and may refer to sailors' stories of the mythical \"''Ilhas Azuis''\".  In fact, the blue-green vegetation on the islands of the Azores appears blue, even at a short distance. The Portuguese word for \"blue\" is similarly '''''azul'''''.\n\nIt is clear that after 1420, regular expeditions captained by [[Gon\u00e7alo Velho Cabral]], [[Diogo de Silves]], and other mariners began exploring to the west and south of continental Portugal.  On 15 August 1432, men form a small sailing vessel with a dozen crew landed on the island that would bear the name Santa Maria (owing to its supposed day of its \"rediscovery\", the [[Assumption of Our Lady|Assumption Day of the Virgin Mary]]).<ref>[[Martin Behaim]] noted that two ships discovered the lands in 1431, and that a fleet of sixteen ships were sent to colonize the islands in 1432.</ref>  With their beginnings in the eastern group of islands, the explorers advanced quickly into the rest of the archipelago, finally reaching the more westerly islands (Flores and Corvo) by about 1450 at a time when populations were already relatively large.<ref>The islands of Flores and Corvo were discovered by [[Pedro Vasquez de la Frontera]] and [[Diogo de Teive]] in 1452, during their return from voyages to the west, usually attributed to other discoveries or from fishing in the '''''Terra dos Bacalhaus''''' (the name attributed to the eastern coast of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] in [[Canada]].</ref>  The first expeditions, apart from coastal observations and an occasional landing were limited, and in most cases involved the deliberate disembarking of herd animals (sheep, goats and/or cattle), pigs and chickens on the discovered islands, as a way of providing future settlers with some means of subsistence. There is also a reference to the purposeful settling of a group of slaves at the end of the 1430s, in the area of Povoa\u00e7\u00e3o on the island of S\u00e3o Miguel.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n==Settlement==\nThe \"official\" colonization of the archipelago began in Santa Maria, where the first settlement was constructed in the area of B\u00e1ia dos Anjos (in the north of the island), and quickly moved to the southern coast (to the area that is now the modern town of [[Vila do Porto]]). Settlers quickly arrived from the provinces of [[Algarve]] and [[Alentejo]] as Gon\u00e7alo Velho's nephew and heir, [[Jo\u00e3o Soares de Albergaria]], advertised and promoted settlement on the island. In the following centuries settlers from other European countries would arrive, most notably from Northern [[France]] and [[Flanders]].\n\nBy 1440, other settlements had developed along the river-valleys and coastal inlets of S\u00e3o Miguel, Terceira, Faial, and Pico, supported by game animals and fishing.  An abundance of potable water sources, along with fertile volcanic soils, made the islands attractive and easy to colonize, and the growing [[wheat]] market supported an export economy (along with various plant species that allowed the development of the dye industry in the colonies).\n\n[[Christopher Columbus]] made an unplanned stop on Santa Maria while returning to Spain after his first voyage to America. His ship ''Ni\u00f1a'' was forced there by a storm. During the storm, all hands had vowed, if they were spared, to make a pilgrimage to the nearest church of Our Lady wherever they first made land. Anchoring at Santa Maria, the travelers were told by people onshore that a small shrine dedicated to Our Lady was nearby.  Columbus sent half the crew ashore to fulfill their vow; he and the rest would go when the first group returneds. But while the first crew members were saying their prayers at the shrine, they were taken prisoner by the island's captain, Jo\u00e3o de Castanheira, ostensibly out of fear that they were pirates. Castanheira commandeered their boat and rowed to ''Ni\u00f1a'' with several armed men, in an attempt to arrest Columbus. Columbus did not allow Castanheira to come aboard, and Castanheira announced that he did not believe or care who Columbus said he was, especially if he was indeed from Spain. After two days, Castanheira released the prisoners, having been unable to get confessions from them, and having been unable to capture his real target, Columbus. There are later claims that Columbus was also captured, but this is not backed up by Columbus's log book.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Columbus in the Azores|jstor = 41104900|date = 1990|last = Catz|first = Rebecca}}</ref>\n\nThe island of S\u00e3o Miguel was apparently populated by 1444. The population came mostly from the regions of [[Estremadura Province (historical)|Estremadura]], [[Alentejo]], and [[Algarve]]. The colonists spread themselves along the coastline in areas where conditions of accessibility and farming were best. The fertility of the Azores contributed to its population expansion, as the islands were soon exporting wheat to the Portuguese garrison in North Africa and of [[sugar cane]] and dyes to [[Flanders]]. Later [[Orange (fruit)|orange]]s were grown and exported to the [[British Isles]]. The area was also frequently subjected to pirate attacks.\n\nDuring these times [[Ponta Delgada]] became the capital. The first capital was [[Vila Franca do Campo]], but when it was destroyed in 1522{{Clarify|date=April 2009}} Ponta Delgada assumed the position. It became the first city on the island in 1546.\n\n[[Terceira Island]] was the third island to be discovered, and its name literally means \"Third Island\". It was originally called the Island of Jesus Christ and was first settled in 1450. [[Graciosa Island]] was settled shortly afterward from settlers from Terceira.\n\n[[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores Island]] was discovered in the late summer of 1452 by the navigator [[Diogo de Teive]] and his son Jo\u00e3o de Teive. The island's charter passed to Fern\u00e3o Telles de Meneses, who only populated the island with sheep in 1475. His widow, Dona Maria Vilhena, contracted the Flemish [[Willem van der Haegen]] to settle Flores. After some negotiation, D. Maria would cede the rights to the exploration of the islands to Van der Haegen, in exchange for monthly payments. Around 1478, Willem van der Haegen settles in Ribeira da Cruz, where he built homes, developed agriculture (primarily wheat), collected more [[woad]] species for export, and explored for [[tin]], [[silver]] or other minerals (under the assumption that the islands were part of the mythic Ilhas Cassterides, the islands of silver and tin). Owing to the island's isolation and difficulties in communication his crops became difficult to export and van der Haegen left Flores in the late 1480s.  \nBy 1504 the island's charter passed to Jo\u00e3o Fonseca and settlers streamed through the port of Armoeira to the small hamlets. The island became permanently populated during the reign of [[King Manuel I]], in the year 1510, by people from various regions of continental Portugal, but mainly from the northern provinces. The island became arable, and [[grain]] and vegetables were cultivated. According to Santos et al.'s 2003 maternal DNA study of the Azores, people from [[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores]] exhibit high genetic ancestry (~90%) with the Portuguese mainland, and Pacheco et al.'s 2006 paternal DNA study confirms that around 60% of all Azorean paternal lines are correlated to those common in mainland Portugal.\n\n==Iberian Union==\nThe residents of Terceira, who mostly settled in [[Porto Judeu]] and [[Praia da Vit\u00f3ria]] and along the coastline, took a brave stand against King [[Philip II of Spain]] upon his ascension to the Portuguese throne in 1580. They, along with most of the rest of the Azores, believed that [[Ant\u00f3nio, Prior of Crato]] was the rightful successor, and defeated the Spanish at the [[Battle of Salga]] in 1581.\n\nIn 1583, Philip tried again at defeating the Azoreans. He sent his combined Iberian fleet to clear the French traders from the Azores, decisively hanging his [[prisoners-of-war]] from the yardarms and contributing to the \"[[Black legend (Spain)|Black Legend]]\". The Azores were the second-to-last part of the Portuguese empire to resist Philip's reign over Portugal ([[Macau]] being the last), Azores was returned to Portuguese control with the end of the [[Iberian Union]], not by the military efforts, as these were already in [[Portuguese Restoration War|Restoration War]] efforts in the mainland, but by the people attacking a well-fortified Castilian guarnition.\n\nThe Azores served as a [[Port#port of call|port of call]] for the Spanish galleons during their occupation. In December 1640 the Portuguese monarchy was restored and the islands again became a Portuguese possession.\n\n==Liberal wars==\n[[File:Islas Azores.JPG|thumb|235px|right|The islands of the Azores as they appeared in an 1818 map by J. Dosserray (ed.)]]\nThe [[Liberal Revolution of 1820|1820 civil war]] in Portugal had strong repercussions in the Azores. In 1829, in [[Vila da Praia]], the [[Liberalism|liberals]] won over the [[Political absolutism|absolutists]], making Terceira the main headquarters of the new Portuguese regime and also where the Council of Regency (''Conselho de Reg\u00eancia'') of [[Mary II of Portugal]] was established.\nIn the second half of the 19th century, Azores played an important role in the rebirth of Portuguese cod fisheries in Terra Nova (Newfoundland). In fact,  it was Azorean emigrants from the East coast returned to their homeland that taught the American dory fishing technique to Portuguese that started to catch again cod in the Grand Bank after the middle of the 19th century.<ref>SILVA, A.

Between 1892 and 1906, it also issued separate stamps for the three administrative districts of the time.\n\nFrom 1836 to 1976, the archipelago was divided into three '''districts''', quite equivalent (except in area) to those in the [[Administrative divisions of Portugal#Districts|Portuguese mainland]]. The division was arbitrary, and didn't follow the natural island groups, rather reflecting the location of each district capital on the three main cities (neither of each on the western group).\n\n*'''Angra''' consisted of Terceira, S\u00e3o Jorge, and Graciosa, with the capital at [[Angra do Hero\u00edsmo]] on Terceira.\n*'''Horta''' consisted of Pico, Faial, Flores, and Corvo, with the capital at [[Horta (Azores)|Horta]] on Faial.\n*'''Ponta Delgada''' consisted of S\u00e3o Miguel and Santa Maria, with the capital at [[Ponta Delgada]] on S\u00e3o Miguel.\n\n==20th century==\nDuring the [[World War II|Second World War]], in 1943, the Portuguese dictator [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]] leased bases in the Azores to the British. This represented a change in policy. Previously the Portuguese government only allowed German U-boats and navy ships to refuel there.<ref>[http://www.adl.org/Braun/dim_14_1_neutrality_europe.asp The Role of Portugal \u2013 co-opting Nazi Gold, Jonathan Petropoulos, ''Dimensions'', Vol 11, No 1, 1997]</ref>  This was a key turning point in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]], allowing the Allies to provide aerial coverage in the middle of the Atlantic (i.e. it closed the [[Mid-Atlantic Gap]]).  This helped them to hunt [[U-boats]] and protect convoys.\n\nIn 1944, American forces constructed a small and short-lived air base on the island of Santa Maria. In 1945, a new base was founded on the island of Terceira and is currently known as [[Lajes Field]].  It was founded in an area called Lajes, a broad, flat sea terrace that had been a farm. Lajes Field is a plateau rising out of the sea on the northeast corner of the island.  This air force base is a joint American and Portuguese venture.  Lajes Field has, and continues to support US and Portuguese military operations. During the [[Cold War]], the US Navy [[P-3 Orion]] anti-submarine squadrons patrolled the North Atlantic for Soviet submarines and surface spy vessels. Since its inception, Lajes Field has been used for refuelling aircraft bound for Europe, and more recently, the [[Middle East]]. The US Army operates a small fleet of military ships in the harbor of [[Praia da Vit\u00f3ria]], three kilometers southeast of Lajes Field. The airfield also has a small commercial terminal handling scheduled and chartered passenger flights from other islands in the archipelago, Europe, and North America.\n\n===Carnation Revolution===\nIn 1976, following the [[Carnation Revolution]] of 1974, the Azores became an [[Autonomous regions of Portugal|Autonomous Region within Portugal]] ({{lang-pt|Regi\u00e3o Aut\u00f3noma dos A\u00e7ores}}), along with [[Madeira]], when the a [[Political status of the Autonomous Region of the Azores|new regional constitution]] was implemented and the Azorean districts were suppressed.\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of Madeira]]\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist|2}}\n;Sources\n* {{cite book | last = Fructuoso| first = G. | title = Saudades da Terra (Vol. 1\u20136), 1873 | publisher = Instituto Cultural de Ponta Delgada, Ponta Delgada| ISBN = 972-9216-70-3|year = 1966}}\n* {{cite book | last = Diffie| first = B.W. |author2=Boyd C.

[[Plato]] articulated the legend of [[Atlantis]].  Ancient writers like [[Plutarch]], [[Strabo]] and, more explicitly, [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Ptolemy]], testified to the real existence of the [[Canary Islands]].\n\nThe Middle Ages saw the emergence of a new set of legends about islands deep in the Atlantic Ocean.  These were sourced in various places, e.g. the Irish ''[[immram]]a'', or missionary sailing voyages (such as the tales of [[The Voyage of the U\u00ed Chorra|Ui Corra]] and [[Saint Brendan]]<ref>Babcock (1922: Ch. 3)</ref>) and the sagas of [[Norsemen|Norse]] adventurers (such as the [[Gr\u0153nlendinga saga]] and the [[saga of Erik the Red]]).  The peoples of the [[Iberian peninsula]], who were closest to the real Atlantic islands, and whose seafarers and fisherman may have seen and even visited them,<ref>Already both [[Plutarch]] (''Life of Sertorius'') and [[Pliny the Elder]] report that fishermen from Gades ([[Cadiz]]) routinely visited Atlantic islands to the southwest.</ref> articulated their own tales.  Medieval [[Al-Andalus|Andalus]]ian [[Arab]]s related stories of Atlantic island encounters in the legend of the 9th-century navigator [[Khashkhash Ibn Saeed Ibn Aswad|Khashkhash]] of Cordoba (told by [[al-Masudi]])<ref>Beazley (1897: vol.1, [https://archive.org/details/dawnmoderngeogr01beazgoog/page/n525 p.465])</ref> and the 12th-century story of the eight ''Maghurin'' (Wanderers) of Lisbon (told by [[al-Idrisi]]).<ref>Beazley (1906: vol. 3, [https://books.google.com/books?id=64MYAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA532#v=onepage&q&f=false p.532]). Cortes\u00e3o (1954 (1975))</ref>\n\nFrom these Greek, Irish, Norse, Arab and Iberian seafaring tales \u2013 often cross-fertilizing each other \u2013 emerged a myriad of [[phantom island|mythical island]]s in the Atlantic Ocean \u2013 [[Atlantis]], the [[Fortunate Islands]], [[Saint Brendan's Island]], [[Brasil (mythical island)|Brasil Island]], [[Antillia]] (or ''Sete Cidades'', the island of the Seven Cities), [[Satanazes]], the ''Ilhas Azuis'' (Blue Islands), the ''Terra dos Bacalhaus'' (Land of Codfish), and so on, which however uncertain, became so ubiquitous that they were considered fact.\n\nAccording to [[Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas]], two dead bodies that looked like those of Amerindians were found on [[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores]]. He said he found that fact in [[Christopher Columbus]]' notes, and it was one reason why Columbus presumed that India was on the other side of the ocean.<ref>De Las Casas, Bartolom\u00e9; [[Anthony Pagden|Pagden, Anthony]] (8 September 1999).

Western islands|year=1813|publisher=Oxford University}}</ref>  who landed there during a storm on his way to [[Lisbon]]. This claim is generally discredited among academics today.  As were local stories of a mysterious equestrian statue and [[Carthaginian coins of Corvo|coins with Carthaginian writing]] that were purportedly discovered on island of Corvo, or the strange inscriptions found along the coast of Quatro Ribeiras (on Terceira): all unsubstantiated stories that supported the claims of human visitation to the islands before the official record.\n\nBut there was some basis in fact, since the Medici maps of 1351 contained seven islands off the Portuguese coast which were arranged in groups of three; there were the southern group, or the Goat Islands (Cabreras), the middle group, or the Wind or Dove Islands (De Ventura Sive de Columbis), and the western islands, or the Brazil Island (De Brazil).  The [[Atlas Catalan]] (of 1375) also identifies three islands with the names of Corvo, Flores, and S\u00e3o Jorge, and it was thought that maybe the Genovese had discovered the Azores, and given them those names. But, generally, these stories highlighted that sightings were being made at the end of the 14th century, or at least, the peoples of Europe had a passing knowledge of islands in the Atlantic. Owing to the disorganized politics of the continent there were few nations able to organize an exploration of the Western Sea.\n\nThere have been recent discoveries (2010\u20132011) of [[Hypogeum|Hypogea]] (structures carved into embankments, that may have been used for burials) on the islands of Corvo, Santa Maria and Terceira, that might allude to a human presence on the islands before the Portuguese.<ref>These archaeological sites were first identified by Nuno Ribeiro (in 2010) during archeological visits to Corvo and Terceira, but further examination and dating were required to authenticate their validity</ref><ref>{{citation|publisher=Correio da Manh\u00e3|language=Portuguese|accessdate=18 June 2011|title=Estruturas podem ter mais de dois mil anos: Monumentos funer\u00e1rios descobertos nos A\u00e7ores|date=5 March 2011|location=Lisbon, Portugal|editor=J.M.A.|author=Lusa|url=http://www.cmjornal.xl.pt/detalhe/noticias/ultima-hora/monumentos-funerarios-descobertos-nos-acores}}</ref><ref name=\"AO\">{{citation|publisher=A\u00e7oreana Oriental|language=Portuguese|accessdate=27 June 2011|title=Estudos arqueol\u00f3gicos podem indicar presen\u00e7a pr\u00e9via ao povoamento das ilhas|date=27 June 2011|location=Ponta Delgada (Azores), Portugal|editor=A.O.

The first map to depict the Azores was the [[Medici Atlas]] (1351). Its depiction was subsequently replicated in the [[Pizzigani brothers]] map of 1367, the [[Catalan Atlas]] (1375), the [[Pinelli\u2013Walckenaer Atlas]] (1384), the [[Corbitis Atlas]] (c. 1385\u20131410), the charts of [[Guillem Soler]] (1380, 1385), [[Mecia de Viladestes]] (1413) and others.<ref>Amat di S. Filippo (1892: [https://books.google.com/books?id=-vM6AQAAIAAJ&pg=PA534#v=onepage&q&f=false p.534]); \nMees (1901: [https://archive.org/details/histoiredeladco00meesgoog/page/n145 p.140]).  Marcel (1887: [https://books.google.com/books?id=xXk9AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA31#v=onepage&q&f=false p.31]) suggests it may have already been hinted at in the [[Angelino Dulcert]] (1339) map, under the names St. Brendan, Primaria sive puellarum, Capraria and Canaria.\n</ref> They are also listed in the ''[[Libro del Conoscimiento]]'' (c. 1380).<ref>''Libro de Conoscimiento'' (1877 ed.: [https://books.google.com/books?id=0lMEEgk1U-kC&pg=PA50#v=onepage&q&f=false p.50])</ref>\n\nIn these maps, the Azores are usually depicted vertically aligned, on a north\u2013south axis, nine islands in three clusters.  The island names, in order (from south to north) are usually (with their tentative translation):\n\nbottom cluster:\n* ''lovo'' or ''lobo'' (\"island of wolves\" (seals?), [[Santa Maria Island (Azores)|Santa Maria]])\n* ''caprara'' or ''cabrera'' (\"island of goats\", [[S\u00e3o Miguel Island|S\u00e3o Miguel]]),\nmiddle cluster:\n* ''y de brazil'' (\"island of embers/fire\", [[Terceira Island|Terceira]])\n* ''li columbi'' (\"island of pigeons\", [[Pico Island|Pico]])\n* ''y de la ventura'' (\"island of venture/winds\",  [[Faial Island|Faial]])\n* ''san zorzo'' (\"island of St. George\", [[S\u00e3o Jorge Island|S\u00e3o Jorge]])\ntop cluster:\n* ''li conigi'' (\"island of rabbits\", [[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores]])\n* ''y de corvis marinis'' (\"island of sea crows\", [[Corvo Island|Corvo]])\n\nIt is notable that two of the names \u2013 ''San Zorzo'' and ''Corvis Marinis'' \u2013 would be transferred to the modern Azorean islands.  Only [[Graciosa Island|Graciosa]] seems to be routinely missing on these maps. The [[Madeira]] archipelago also appears on most of these same maps, with their modern names:  ''legname'' ([[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]] for \"wood\", [[Madeira]]), ''porto sancto'' ([[Porto Santo]]), ''desertas'' ([[Desertas]]) and ''salvazes'' ([[Savage Islands|Savage Island]]).\n\nThe source of this information is a mystery. It could simply be derived from pure legend, possibly of [[al-Andalus|Andalusian]] Arab origin e.g. [[al-Idrisi]] speaks of an Atlantic island of wild goats (the Caprera?) and another of \"cormorants\", a scavenger bird (the \"sea crows\" of Corvis Marinis?)<ref>Babcock, [https://archive.org/details/legendaryisland00babcgoog/page/n136 p.166]</ref>  But outside their erroneous axial tilt, the Azores do seem clustered with reasonable accuracy. From this cartographic record, there seems little doubt that both Madeira and the Azores were discovered, or at least sighted, during the 14th century, well before their official discovery dates.<ref>Cortes\u00e3o (1954 (1975):[https://books.google.com/books?id=2PbNS0LHn60C&lpg=PP1&pg=RA1-PA82#v=onepage&q&f=false p.82]); Cortes\u00e3o (1969: p.67)</ref>\n\nOne (unproven) hypothesis is that the Azores were discovered in the course of a mapping expedition in 1341 to the [[Canary Islands]], sponsored by King [[Afonso IV of Portugal]], and commanded by the Florentine [[Angiolino del Tegghia de Corbizzi]] and the Genoese [[Nicoloso da Recco]].<ref>The 1341 expedition is related by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] \"De Canaria et insula reliquis, ultra Ispaniam, in occeano noviter repertis\" (repr. in ''Monumenta Henricina'', vol.

In this period, expanding commercial contacts linked the Mediterranean with communities along the Atlantic coast. In particular, [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]], [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]], and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] traders were active, and also religious groups seeking converts to Christianity. This expansion placed the Kingdom of Portugal in a strategic position. The seafaring Portuguese were eager to expand their realm and their influence.\n\nIn this context, [[Prince Henry the Navigator]] (1394\u20131460) had an important role. He added his own financial support to the efforts of  the Portuguese crown. He financed the construction of new ships, and established naval schools to harness seafaring knowledge and promote new technologies and their use. Prince Henry is generally credited with motivating modern navigation and directing discoveries during the age of exploration; for Azoreans he is one of their founding fathers.\n\nPrince Henry hoped to establish communication by sea with [[India]] and the legendary realm of [[Prester John]], thereby outflanking the hostile [[Islam|Muslim]] states in northern Africa and the [[Holy Land]]. He was Grand Master of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Military Order of Christ]], whose program of exploration, discovery, and settlement was tailored for this dual purpose.\n\nPrince Henry experimented with ships, navigational instruments, and maps, developing techniques that made oceanic travel possible. The Portuguese Atlantic islands were not unknown; a growing body of documents had shown that the islands were known to sailors. But most important, in the words of Prince Henry's personal chronicler, is that the Prince \"ordered [Portuguese navigators and captains] to find the islands\", rather than just sending his fleets into the unknown to discover what they could.\n\n===The re-discovery===\nThe exact date of this re-discovery of the Atlantic islands is not clear, though historical accounts indicate that the islands of [[Santa Maria Island (Azores)|Santa Maria]] and [[S\u00e3o Miguel Island|S\u00e3o Miguel]] were the first to be discovered by navigator [[Diogo de Silves]] around 1427.\n\nOne fact often debated is the origin of the name \"Azores\" used to identify the archipelago.  By 1492, in the globe of [[Martin Behaim]], the eastern and central group of islands were referred to as '''''Insulae Azore''''' (\"Islands of the Azores\"), while the islands of western group were called the '''''Insulae Flores''''' (\"Islands of Flowers\"). Similarly, older nautical charts had identified them as the '''''Ilhas Afortunadas''''' (\"The Fortunate Islands\") or '''''Ilhas de S\u00e3o Brand\u00e3o''''' (\"The Islands of Saint Brendan\").  The use of mythical names in local naming became a theme; in S\u00e3o Miguel and Pico there are communities called '''''Sete Cidades''''', on Terceira, a peninsula along the southern coast is referred to as Monte Brasil, and the name Mosteiros is used on both islands of S\u00e3o Miguel and Flores.  There are also many examples of re-using names from island to island (for example, Cedros, S\u00e3o Pedro, Feteiras, or Calheta). Three theories have developed about the naming of the archipelago.\n\n* The classical theory attributes the naming to the presence of [[diurnality|diurnal]] [[birds of prey]] (some say [[Accipiter|goshawks]], while others species of [[Accipitridae|eagles]]), identified by Portuguese sailors at the time of discovery. But this theory has been discredited. The only bird of prey that nests in the archipelago is the [[common buzzard]] (''Buteo buteo rothschildi''), which was introduced during the period of colonization and settlement. Sailors may have confused existing migratory birds for such birds of prey, or used colloquial names and attributed them to these species, or some bird of prey species was present that became extinct since colonization;\n* The naming of the islands may have been an homage by the discoverer [[Gon\u00e7alo Velho Cabral]] to Santa Maria of A\u00e7ores, patron saint of the parish of A\u00e7ores, in the municipality of [[Celorico da Beira]], District of [[Guarda District|Guarda]].\n* \"Azores\" may have been a Portuguese variant of the [[Genoa|Genovese]] or [[Florence|Florentine]] word '''''azzurre''''' or '''''azzorre''''' (\"blue\") and may refer to sailors' stories of the mythical \"''Ilhas Azuis''\".  In fact, the blue-green vegetation on the islands of the Azores appears blue, even at a short distance. The Portuguese word for \"blue\" is similarly '''''azul'''''.\n\nIt is clear that after 1420, regular expeditions captained by [[Gon\u00e7alo Velho Cabral]], [[Diogo de Silves]], and other mariners began exploring to the west and south of continental Portugal.  On 15 August 1432, men form a small sailing vessel with a dozen crew landed on the island that would bear the name Santa Maria (owing to its supposed day of its \"rediscovery\", the [[Assumption of Our Lady|Assumption Day of the Virgin Mary]]).<ref>[[Martin Behaim]] noted that two ships discovered the lands in 1431, and that a fleet of sixteen ships were sent to colonize the islands in 1432.</ref>  With their beginnings in the eastern group of islands, the explorers advanced quickly into the rest of the archipelago, finally reaching the more westerly islands (Flores and Corvo) by about 1450 at a time when populations were already relatively large.<ref>The islands of Flores and Corvo were discovered by [[Pedro Vasquez de la Frontera]] and [[Diogo de Teive]] in 1452, during their return from voyages to the west, usually attributed to other discoveries or from fishing in the '''''Terra dos Bacalhaus''''' (the name attributed to the eastern coast of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] in [[Canada]].</ref>  The first expeditions, apart from coastal observations and an occasional landing were limited, and in most cases involved the deliberate disembarking of herd animals (sheep, goats and/or cattle), pigs and chickens on the discovered islands, as a way of providing future settlers with some means of subsistence. There is also a reference to the purposeful settling of a group of slaves at the end of the 1430s, in the area of Povoa\u00e7\u00e3o on the island of S\u00e3o Miguel.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n==Settlement==\nThe \"official\" colonization of the archipelago began in Santa Maria, where the first settlement was constructed in the area of B\u00e1ia dos Anjos (in the north of the island), and quickly moved to the southern coast (to the area that is now the modern town of [[Vila do Porto]]). Settlers quickly arrived from the provinces of [[Algarve]] and [[Alentejo]] as Gon\u00e7alo Velho's nephew and heir, [[Jo\u00e3o Soares de Albergaria]], advertised and promoted settlement on the island. In the following centuries settlers from other European countries would arrive, most notably from Northern [[France]] and [[Flanders]].\n\nBy 1440, other settlements had developed along the river-valleys and coastal inlets of S\u00e3o Miguel, Terceira, Faial, and Pico, supported by game animals and fishing.  An abundance of potable water sources, along with fertile volcanic soils, made the islands attractive and easy to colonize, and the growing [[wheat]] market supported an export economy (along with various plant species that allowed the development of the dye industry in the colonies).\n\n[[Christopher Columbus]] made an unplanned stop on Santa Maria while returning to Spain after his first voyage to America. His ship ''Ni\u00f1a'' was forced there by a storm. During the storm, all hands had vowed, if they were spared, to make a pilgrimage to the nearest church of Our Lady wherever they first made land. Anchoring at Santa Maria, the travelers were told by people onshore that a small shrine dedicated to Our Lady was nearby.  Columbus sent half the crew ashore to fulfill their vow; he and the rest would go when the first group returneds. But while the first crew members were saying their prayers at the shrine, they were taken prisoner by the island's captain, Jo\u00e3o de Castanheira, ostensibly out of fear that they were pirates. Castanheira commandeered their boat and rowed to ''Ni\u00f1a'' with several armed men, in an attempt to arrest Columbus. Columbus did not allow Castanheira to come aboard, and Castanheira announced that he did not believe or care who Columbus sai he was, especially if he was indeed from Spain. After two days, Castanheira released the prisoners, having been unable to get confessions from them, and having been unable to capture his real target, Columbus. There are later claims that Columbus was also captured, but this is not backed up by Columbus's log book.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Columbus in the Azores|jstor = 41104900|date = 1990|last = Catz|first = Rebecca}}</ref>\n\nThe island of S\u00e3o Miguel was apparently populated by 1444. The population came mostly from the regions of [[Estremadura Province (historical)|Estremadura]], [[Alentejo]], and [[Algarve]]. The colonists spread themselves along the coastline in areas where conditions of accessibility and farming were best. The fertility of the Azores contributed to its population expansion, as the islands were soon exporting wheat to the Portuguese garrison in North Africa and of [[sugar cane]] and dyes to [[Flanders]]. Later [[Orange (fruit)|orange]]s were grown and exported to the [[British Isles]]. The area was also frequently subjected to pirate attacks.\n\nDuring these times [[Ponta Delgada]] became the capital. The first capital was [[Vila Franca do Campo]], but when it was destroyed in 1522{{Clarify|date=April 2009}} Ponta Delgada assumed the position. It became the first city on the island in 1546.\n\n[[Terceira Island]] was the third island to be discovered, and its name literally means \"Third Island\". It was originally called the Island of Jesus Christ and was first settled in 1450. [[Graciosa Island]] was settled shortly afterward from settlers from Terceira.\n\n[[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores Island]] was discovered in the late summer of 1452 by the navigator [[Diogo de Teive]] and his son Jo\u00e3o de Teive. The island's charter passed to Fern\u00e3o Telles de Meneses, who only populated the island with sheep in 1475. His widow, Dona Maria Vilhena, contracted the Flemish [[Willem van der Haegen]] to settle Flores. After some negotiation, D. Maria would cede the rights to the exploration of the islands to Van der Haegen, in exchange for monthly payments. Around 1478, Willem van der Haegen settles in Ribeira da Cruz, where he built homes, developed agriculture (primarily wheat), collected more [[woad]] species for export, and explored for [[tin]], [[silver]] or other minerals (under the assumption that the islands were part of the mythic Ilhas Cassterides, the islands of silver and tin). Owing to the island's isolation and difficulties in communication his crops became difficult to export and van der Haegen left Flores in the late 1480s.  \nBy 1504 the island's charter passed to Jo\u00e3o Fonseca and settlers streamed through the port of Armoeira to the small hamlets. The island became permanently populated during the reign of [[King Manuel I]], in the year 1510, by people from various regions of continental Portugal, but mainly from the northern provinces. The island became arable, and [[grain]] and vegetables were cultivated. According to Santos et al.'s 2003 maternal DNA study of the Azores, people from [[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores]] exhibit high genetic ancestry (~90%) with the Portuguese mainland, and Pacheco et al.'s 2006 paternal DNA study confirms that around 60% of all Azorean paternal lines are correlated to those common in mainland Portugal.\n\n==Iberian Union==\nThe residents of Terceira, who mostly settled in [[Porto Judeu]] and [[Praia da Vit\u00f3ria]] and along the coastline, took a brave stand against King [[Philip II of Spain]] upon his ascension to the Portuguese throne in 1580. They, along with most of the rest of the Azores, believed that [[Ant\u00f3nio, Prior of Crato]] was the rightful successor, and defeated the Spanish at the [[Battle of Salga]] in 1581.\n\nIn 1583, Philip tried again at defeating the Azoreans. He sent his combined Iberian fleet to clear the French traders from the Azores, decisively hanging his [[prisoners-of-war]] from the yardarms and contributing to the \"[[Black legend (Spain)|Black Legend]]\". The Azores were the second-to-last part of the Portuguese empire to resist Philip's reign over Portugal ([[Macau]] being the last), Azores was returned to Portuguese control with the end of the [[Iberian Union]], not by the military efforts, as these were already in [[Portuguese Restoration War|Restoration War]] efforts in the mainland, but by the people attacking a well-fortified Castilian guarnition.\n\nThe Azores served as a [[Port#port of call|port of call]] for the Spanish galleons during their occupation. In December 1640 the Portuguese monarchy was restored and the islands again became a Portuguese possession.\n\n==Liberal wars==\n[[File:Islas Azores.JPG|thumb|235px|right|The islands of the Azores as they appeared in an 1818 map by J. Dosserray (ed.)]]\nThe [[Liberal Revolution of 1820|1820 civil war]] in Portugal had strong repercussions in the Azores. In 1829, in [[Vila da Praia]], the [[Liberalism|liberals]] won over the [[Political absolutism|absolutists]], making Terceira the main headquarters of the new Portuguese regime and also where the Council of Regency (''Conselho de Reg\u00eancia'') of [[Mary II of Portugal]] was established.\nIn the second half of the 19th century, Azores played an important role in the rebirth of Portuguese cod fisheries in Terra Nova (Newfoundland). In fact,  it was Azorean emigrants from the East coast returned to their homeland that taught the American dory fishing technique to Portuguese that started to catch again cod in the Grand Bank after the middle of the 19th century.<ref>SILVA, A.

Between 1892 and 1906, it also issued separate stamps for the three administrative districts of the time.\n\nFrom 1836 to 1976, the archipelago was divided into three '''districts''', quite equivalent (except in area) to those in the [[Administrative divisions of Portugal#Districts|Portuguese mainland]]. The division was arbitrary, and didn't follow the natural island groups, rather reflecting the location of each district capital on the three main cities (neither of each on the western group).\n\n*'''Angra''' consisted of Terceira, S\u00e3o Jorge, and Graciosa, with the capital at [[Angra do Hero\u00edsmo]] on Terceira.\n*'''Horta''' consisted of Pico, Faial, Flores, and Corvo, with the capital at [[Horta (Azores)|Horta]] on Faial.\n*'''Ponta Delgada''' consisted of S\u00e3o Miguel and Santa Maria, with the capital at [[Ponta Delgada]] on S\u00e3o Miguel.\n\n==20th century==\nDuring the [[World War II|Second World War]], in 1943, the Portuguese dictator [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]] leased bases in the Azores to the British. This represented a change in policy. Previously the Portuguese government only allowed German U-boats and navy ships to refuel there.<ref>[http://www.adl.org/Braun/dim_14_1_neutrality_europe.asp The Role of Portugal \u2013 co-opting Nazi Gold, Jonathan Petropoulos, ''Dimensions'', Vol 11, No 1, 1997]</ref>  This was a key turning point in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]], allowing the Allies to provide aerial coverage in the middle of the Atlantic (i.e. it closed the [[Mid-Atlantic Gap]]).  This helped them to hunt [[U-boats]] and protect convoys.\n\nIn 1944, American forces constructed a small and short-lived air base on the island of Santa Maria. In 1945, a new base was founded on the island of Terceira and is currently known as [[Lajes Field]].  It was founded in an area called Lajes, a broad, flat sea terrace that had been a farm. Lajes Field is a plateau rising out of the sea on the northeast corner of the island.  This air force base is a joint American and Portuguese venture.  Lajes Field has, and continues to support US and Portuguese military operations. During the [[Cold War]], the US Navy [[P-3 Orion]] anti-submarine squadrons patrolled the North Atlantic for Soviet submarines and surface spy vessels. Since its inception, Lajes Field has been used for refuelling aircraft bound for Europe, and more recently, the [[Middle East]]. The US Army operates a small fleet of military ships in the harbor of [[Praia da Vit\u00f3ria]], three kilometers southeast of Lajes Field. The airfield also has a small commercial terminal handling scheduled and chartered passenger flights from other islands in the archipelago, Europe, and North America.\n\n===Carnation Revolution===\nIn 1976, following the [[Carnation Revolution]] of 1974, the Azores became an [[Autonomous regions of Portugal|Autonomous Region within Portugal]] ({{lang-pt|Regi\u00e3o Aut\u00f3noma dos A\u00e7ores}}), along with [[Madeira]], when the a [[Political status of the Autonomous Region of the Azores|new regional constitution]] was implemented and the Azorean districts were suppressed.\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of Madeira]]\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist|2}}\n;Sources\n* {{cite book | last = Fructuoso| first = G. | title = Saudades da Terra (Vol. 1\u20136), 1873 | publisher = Instituto Cultural de Ponta Delgada, Ponta Delgada| ISBN = 972-9216-70-3|year = 1966}}\n* {{cite book | last = Diffie| first = B.W. |author2=Boyd C.
