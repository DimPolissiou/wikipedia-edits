On 2 July 1776, at Palamutka, Austrians and Ottomans signed a border convention, the Habsburg Monarchy giving back 59 of the previously occupied villages, and remaining with 278 villages.

With effect of 4 March 1849, the former ''Kreis'' was declared the ''Herzogtum Bukowina'', a nominal duchy as part of the official full style of the [[Emperor of Austria|Austrian emperor]]. It was governed by a ''[[Imperial-Royal|k.k.]] Statthalter'' ([[stadtholder]]) appointed by the emperor, with his official residence at Czernowitz from 1850.\n\nIn 1860 the Bukovina was again amalgamated with Galicia, but reinstated as a separate province once again according to the 1861 [[February Patent]] issued by Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]].

As he moved his army south he left six regiments under the direction of Lieutenant General [[James Livingstone, 1st Earl of Callander]], to lay siege to the city of [[Newcastle-on-Tyne]] from 3 February (when the town was formally asked to surrender){{sfn|Murdoch|Grosjean|2014|pp=134-136}}{{sfn|Lindsay}}{{sfn|Plant|2006}}\n\n==Battle of Marston Moor==\nThe city was not continually invested in this time. In a complicated situation, as the Earl of Callander diverted his troops to take surrounding towns like [[Newburn]], as the main Covenanter army pressed south. In the meantime, the royalist governor having reinforced his position then committed forces south also where the main Covenanter-Parliamentarian allied armies clashed with the Royalists at the [[Battle of Marston Moor]].{{sfn|Fraser|Emsley|1973|p=37}}\n\nIt was the defeat of the Royalist field army at [[Battle of Marston Moor|Marston Moor]] on 2 July that decided the fate of Newcastle and all the other Royalist strongholds in the North East of England, because without the means of relief from an army in the field the capitulation of all such strongholds was only a matter of time.{{sfn|Lindsay}}{{sfn|Plant|2006}}{{sfn|Plant|2008}}\n\n==Bombardment, storming and surrender==\nFrom 15 August 1644 Newcastle and Tynemouth were again the main target for Callander, now joined by the main Covenanters under Leven. Bombardment and mines were necessary to breach the walls. The western half fell on 19 October 1644. Those remaining loyal to the Royalist cause retreated into the [[Newcastle Castle Keep|Castle Keep]]. Finding the situation hopeless,  surrender was negotiated with General Leslie by the Royalist  Governor,  Sir [[John Marlay (MP)|John Marlay]] on 21 October 1644. The terms of surrender were generous: the promise of mercy for the garrison was fulfilled, although some of the Royalist  leaders, including Marlay himself,  suffered imprisonment or banishment.{{sfn|Murdoch|Grosjean|2014|pp=134-136}}{{sfn|Fraser|Emsley|1973|p=37}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Covenanters were delighted at the result, more so it is thought than the English Parliament.
