[[Robert Dole]] (R-[[List of United States Senators from Kansas|Kansas]]) and [[Robert C. Byrd]] (D-[[List of United States Senators from West Virginia|West Virginia]]) exchanged positions as the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader. They defeated seven incumbents, all but one of whom had been elected in 1980, and gained open seats in Maryland and Nevada. \n\nThis was the last election \u2014 until [[2016 United States Senate elections|2016]] \u2014 in which the Democrats in this Class of Senators (1/3 of the Senate) amassed a gain in seats (not including special elections held in off-years in some states to fill the seats that had been vacated by Senators due to death, resignation, or otherwise).\n\n== Republican gain ==\n\nThe only gain by the Republican Party was for the open seat in [[List of United States Senators from Missouri|Missouri]]. The Democrats gained open seats in [[List of United States Senators from Maryland|Maryland]] and [[List of United States Senators from Nevada|Nevada]], and defeated seven incumbent Republican Senators, six of them who were first-term senators who had been elected in 1980.\n\n== Incumbents who lost re-election ==\n\n* [[Jeremiah Denton]] (R-[[List of United States Senators from Alabama|Alabama]])\n* [[Paula Hawkins]] (R-[[List of United States Senators from Florida|Florida]])\n* [[Mack Mattingly]] (R-[[List of United States Senators from Georgia|Georgia]])\n* [[James T.

At the time of this announcement, it was expected that then-[[Governor of Maryland|Governor]] [[Harry Hughes]] would run for the seat being vacated by retiring Senator Mathias. However, Hughes became caught up in the aftermath of the Maryland [[savings and loan crisis]]. He lost popularity with voters, opening the door for Mikulski's bid for the Senate.\n\nChavez won the primary handily, defeating several Republican challengers. Later, she made comments that some Mikulski supporters interpreted as an attempt to draw attention to the issue of Mikulski's [[sexual orientation]]. In an article quoting Chavez's claim that Mikulski was a \"[[San Francisco]]-style, [[George McGovern]], liberal Democrat\", the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported that Chavez was directly implying that the never-married Mikulski was a [[lesbian]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Chavez was accused of making Mikulski's [[sexual orientation]] a central issue of the [[political campaign]]. In defending her use of the phrase, Chavez stated the line \"San Francisco Democrats\" was a reference to [[Jeane Kirkpatrick]]'s [[1984 Republican National Convention]] \"Blame America First\" speech, in which Kirkpatrick coined the phrase \"San Francisco Liberal.\"{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. The phrase \"San Francisco liberal\" was common at the time.\n\nMikulski never directly responded to the issue and eventually won the race with 61 percent of the vote.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  She was the first female Democrat elected to the U.S. Senate in her own right (not appointed or filling a seat of a deceased husband).\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title = 1986 United States Senate election in Maryland<ref name=clerk/>\n}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | candidate = Barbara A.

Additionally, economic woes had dragged down the popularity of Republican candidates in the industrial states. Democrats sensed the vulnerability of the incumbent, and two men with similar experience in the U.S. House, but contrasting political views, vied for the nomination. [[Donald A. Bailey|Don Bailey]], the state's incumbent Auditor General, was viewed{{By whom|date=August 2016}} as the initial favorite, as he projected a strong blue collar image and had moderate positions that were often relatively close to Specter's. Bob Edgar, a [[Methodist]] minister and sitting Congressman, had more liberal viewpoints, as he was connected with the [[Vietnam War]]-era peace movement and the anti-corruption movement following the [[Watergate]] scandals. However, issues played a very minor role in the primary, which instead showcased the state's geographical divide, with [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware County]]-based Edgar narrowly defeating [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland County]]-based Bailey.<ref name=kennedy>{{cite book | last=Kennedy | first=John J. | title=Pennsylvania Elections: Statewide Contests from 1950-2004 | date=2006 | publisher=United Press of America | isbn=9780761832799 | pages=65\u201367 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=1J_9q-lIWRkC&pg=PA66&dq=specter+edgar#v=onepage&q=specter%20edgar&f=false}}</ref>\n\nTrue to his past as a political organizer, Edgar developed a strong grassroots campaign and reached out to alienated left-leaning voters. He attacked Specter as a politician who compromised his moderate political positions when pressured by the conservative administration of [[Ronald Reagan]]. Edgar, who had a history of winning tight races in his congressional district, was a financial underdog, as Specter was able to raise nearly three times as much for his campaign warchest. Originally attempting a positive campaign, Specter changed his strategy in response to Edgar's personal attacks and characterized Edgar as soft on defense issues and as a liberal ideologue.

[[Robert Dole]] (R-[[List of United States Senators from Kansas|Kansas]]) and [[Robert C. Byrd]] (D-[[List of United States Senators from West Virginia|West Virginia]]) exchanged positions as the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader. They defeated seven incumbents, all but one of whom had been elected in 1980, and gained open seats in Maryland and Nevada. \n\nThis was the last election \u2014 until [[2016 United States Senate elections|2016]] \u2014 in which the Democrats in this Class of Senators (1/3 of the Senate) amassed a gain in seats (not including special elections held in off-years in some states to fill the seats that had been vacated by Senators due to death, resignation, or otherwise).\n\n== Republican gain ==\n\nThe only gain by the Republican Party was for the open seat in [[List of United States Senators from Missouri|Missouri]]. The Democrats gained open seats in [[List of United States Senators from Maryland|Maryland]] and [[List of United States Senators from Nevada|Nevada]], and defeated seven incumbent Republican Senators, six of them who were first-term senators who had been elected in 1980.\n\n== Incumbents who lost re-election ==\n\n* [[Jeremiah Denton]] (R-[[List of United States Senators from Alabama|Alabama]])\n* [[Paula Hawkins]] (R-[[List of United States Senators from Florida|Florida]])\n* [[Mack Mattingly]] (R-[[List of United States Senators from Georgia|Georgia]])\n* [[James T. Broyhill]] (R-[[List of United States Senators from North Carolina|North Carolina]]). Broyhill was the only Republican who was defeated who had not been elected for the first time in 1980. However, Broyhill had been appointed to the seat that had been left vacant by the suicide of [[John P.

However, Hughes became caught up in the aftermath of the Maryland [[savings and loan crisis]]. He lost popularity with voters, opening the door for Mikulski's bid for the Senate.\n\nChavez won the primary handily, defeating several Republican challengers. Later, she made comments that some Mikulski supporters interpreted as an attempt to draw attention to the issue of Mikulski's [[sexual orientation]]. In an article quoting Chavez's claim that Mikulski was a \"[[San Francisco]]-style, [[George McGovern]], liberal Democrat\", the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported that Chavez was directly implying that the never-married Mikulski was a [[lesbian]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Chavez was accused of making Mikulski's [[sexual orientation]] a central issue of the [[political campaign]]. In defending her use of the phrase, Chavez stated the line \"San Francisco Democrats\" was a reference to [[Jeane Kirkpatrick]]'s [[1984 Republican National Convention]] \"Blame America First\" speech, in which Kirkpatrick coined the phrase \"San Francisco Liberal.\"{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. The phrase \"San Francisco liberal\" was common at the time.\n\nMikulski never directly responded to the issue and eventually won the race with 61 percent of the vote.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  She was the first female Democrat elected to the U.S. Senate in her own right (not appointed or filling a seat of a deceased husband).\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title = 1986 United States Senate election in Maryland<ref name=clerk/>\n}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | candidate = Barbara A.

Bailey|Don Bailey]], the state's incumbent Auditor General, was viewed{{By whom|date=August 2016}} as the initial favorite, as he projected a strong blue collar image and had moderate positions that were often relatively close to Specter's. Bob Edgar, a [[Methodist]] minister and sitting Congressman, had more liberal viewpoints, as he was connected with the [[Vietnam War]]-era peace movement and the anti-corruption movement following the [[Watergate]] scandals. However, issues played a very minor role in the primary, which instead showcased the state's geographical divide, with [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware County]]-based Edgar narrowly defeating [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland County]]-based Bailey.<ref name=kennedy>{{cite book | last=Kennedy | first=John J. | title=Pennsylvania Elections: Statewide Contests from 1950-2004 | date=2006 | publisher=United Press of America | isbn=9780761832799 | pages=65\u201367 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=1J_9q-lIWRkC&pg=PA66&dq=specter+edgar#v=onepage&q=specter%20edgar&f=false}}</ref>\n\nTrue to his past as a political organizer, Edgar developed a strong grassroots campaign and reached out to alienated left-leaning voters. He attacked Specter as a politician who compromised his moderate political positions when pressured by the conservative administration of [[Ronald Reagan]]. Edgar, who had a history of winning tight races in his congressional district, was a financial underdog, as Specter was able to raise nearly three times as much for his campaign warchest. Originally attempting a positive campaign, Specter changed his strategy in response to Edgar's personal attacks and characterized Edgar as soft on defense issues and as a liberal ideologue. Edgar was never able to find a message that resonated with voters in the western portion of the state, and Specter undercut Edgar's support in both candidates' suburban Philadelphia home by presenting himself as representative of the views of the average suburban voter.<ref name=kennedy/>\n\n{{Election box begin no change\n | title=General election results<ref name=clerk/>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link no change\n | party = Republican Party (US)\n | candidate = Arlen Specter (Incumbent)\n | votes = 1,906,537\n | percentage = 56.4%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link no change\n | party = Democratic Party (US)\n | candidate = Robert W.

Though Boggs was expected to easily win a third term over the then-unknown Biden, it ended up being the closest Senate election in 1972, and Biden narrowly beat out Boggs by a little over three thousand votes, winning what would be his first of seven terms.\n\nBoggs, a longtime Delaware political figure, was considering retirement which would likely have led to a primary campaign between two Republicans, [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Pierre S. du Pont, IV|Pete du Pont]] and Wilmington Mayor [[Harry G.

Though Boggs was expected to easily win a third term over the then-unknown Biden, it ended up being the closest Senate election in 1972, and Biden narrowly beat out Boggs by a little over three thousand votes, winning what would be his first of seven terms.\n\nBoggs, a longtime Delaware political figure, was considering retirement which would likely have led to a primary campaign between two Republicans, [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Pierre S. du Pont, IV|Pete du Pont]] and Wilmington Mayor [[Harry G. Haskell Jr.]]. To avoid the anticipated divisive [[primary election|primary]] fight, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard M.

Thirty-three seats were up for regular elections; the winners were eligible to serve six-year terms from January 3, 2009 to January 3, 2015, as members of [[U.S. Senate Class 2|Class 2]]. There were also two [[List of special elections to the United States Senate|special elections]], the winners of those seats would finish the terms that ended January 3, 2013.\n\nThe [[2008 United States presidential election|presidential election]] which was won by Democrat [[Barack Obama]], [[2008 United States House of Representatives elections|elections for all House of Representatives seats]], and several [[2008 United States gubernatorial elections|gubernatorial elections]], as well as many state and local elections, occurred on the same date.\n\nGoing into these elections, the Senate consisted of 49 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], 49 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], and two Independents who caucused with the Democrats, giving the Democratic caucus the slightest 51-49 majority.<ref name =cnn-perfectstorm>{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/08/senate.election | title='Perfect storm' could give Dems 'magic 60' in Senate | first=Emily | last=Sherman | publisher=CNN | date=October 8, 2008 | accessdate=November 19, 2008}}</ref> Of the seats up for election in 2008, 23 were held by Republicans and 12 by Democrats.

Democratic candidates defeated Republican incumbents in [[2008 United States Senate election in Alaska|Alaska]], [[2008 United States Senate election in New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], [[2008 United States Senate election in North Carolina|North Carolina]], [[2008 United States Senate election in Oregon|Oregon]], and after a lengthy recount process, [[2008 United States Senate election in Minnesota|Minnesota]]. Additionally, they won Republican-held open seats in [[2008 United States Senate election in Colorado|Colorado]], [[2008 United States Senate election in New Mexico|New Mexico]] and [[2008 United States Senate election in Virginia|Virginia]]. This election was the second cycle in a row in which no seats switched from Democratic to Republican. In addition, this was the largest Democratic Senate gain since [[1986 United States Senate elections|1986]], when they also won eight seats.  These elections marked the first time since [[1964 United States Senate elections|1964]] in which a Democratic presidential candidate won the White House with Senate coattails.  Finally, 2008 was the first presidential election year since 1948 in which Senate Class 2 saw net gains for the winning presidential candidate's party.\n\nWhen the new senators were first sworn in, the balance was 58\u201341 in favor of the Democrats, because of the [[2008 United States Senate election in Minnesota|unresolved Senate election in Minnesota]]. The April 2009 party switch of [[Arlen Specter]] from Republican to Democrat and the July 2009 resolution of the Minnesota election in favor of Democrat [[Al Franken]] increased the Democratic majority to 60\u201340. Republicans gained a seat in a [[2010 United States Senate special election in Massachusetts|January 2010 special election in Massachusetts]], making the balance 59-41 before the start of the [[2010 United States Senate elections|next election cycle]].\n\n== Gains and losses ==\nDemocrats defeated five Republican incumbents:\n\n* [[2008 United States Senate election in Alaska|Alaska]]: [[Ted Stevens]] lost to [[Mark Begich]].\n* [[2008 United States Senate election in Minnesota|Minnesota]]: [[Norm Coleman]] lost to [[Al Franken]]. The race was the subject of a protracted recount, and was not resolved until July 2009.\n* [[2008 United States Senate election in New Hampshire|New Hampshire]]: [[John E. Sununu|John Sununu]] lost to [[Jeanne Shaheen]].\n* [[2008 United States Senate election in North Carolina|North Carolina]]: [[Elizabeth Dole]] lost to [[Kay Hagan]].\n* [[2008 United States Senate election in Oregon|Oregon]]: [[Gordon Smith (politician)|Gordon Smith]] lost to [[Jeff Merkley]].\n\nDemocrats also picked up three Republican-held open seats: [[2008 United States Senate election in Colorado|Colorado]], [[2008 United States Senate election in New Mexico|New Mexico]], and [[2008 United States Senate election in Virginia|Virginia]].\n\n== Results summary ==\n\n{|

There was speculation as to whether the outgoing Governor, [[Ruth Ann Minner]], or the incoming Governor-elect [[Jack Markell]] would make the appointment, and if Biden's son, Delaware Attorney General [[Beau Biden]] would receive the appointment. On November 24, 2008, Governor Minner appointed Biden's longtime Chief of Staff [[Ted Kaufman]] to fill the seat. Kaufman subsequently announced that he would not seek election to a full term in 2010, effectively making him a caretaker. Biden's Republican opponent in the Senate race, conservative political commentator [[Christine O'Donnell]], tried to make an issue of Biden's dual campaigns, claiming that serving his constituents is not important to him. Kaufman has since stated that he will not run for the unexpired term in 2010.\n\nBiden was re-elected with 65% of the vote, or 257,484 votes. O'Donnell received 140,584 votes (35% of the vote).\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Georgia ==\n{{Infobox election\n | election_name      = Georgia election\n | country            = Georgia (U.S. state)\n | type

There were also two [[List of special elections to the United States Senate|special elections]], the winners of those seats would finish the terms that ended January 3, 2013.\n\nThe [[2008 United States presidential election|presidential election]] which was won by Democrat [[Barack Obama]], [[2008 United States House of Representatives elections|elections for all House of Representatives seats]], and several [[2008 United States gubernatorial elections|gubernatorial elections]], as well as many state and local elections, occurred on the same date.\n\nGoing into these elections, the Senate consisted of 49 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], 49 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], and two Independents who caucused with the Democrats, giving the Democratic caucus the slightest 51-49 majority.<ref name =cnn-perfectstorm>{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/08/senate.election | title='Perfect storm' could give Dems 'magic 60' in Senate | first=Emily | last=Sherman | publisher=CNN | date=October 8, 2008 | accessdate=November 19, 2008}}</ref> Of the seats up for election in 2008, 23 were held by Republicans and 12 by Democrats.

Democratic candidates defeated Republican incumbents in [[2008 United States Senate election in Alaska|Alaska]], [[2008 United States Senate election in New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], [[2008 United States Senate election in North Carolina|North Carolina]], [[2008 United States Senate election in Oregon|Oregon]], and after a lengthy recount process, [[2008 United States Senate election in Minnesota|Minnesota]]. Additionally, they won Republican-held open seats in [[2008 United States Senate election in Colorado|Colorado]], [[2008 United States Senate election in New Mexico|New Mexico]] and [[2008 United States Senate election in Virginia|Virginia]]. This election was the second cycle in a row in which no seats switched from Democratic to Republican. In addition, this was the largest Democratic Senate gain since [[1986 United States Senate elections|1986]], when they also won eight seats.  These elections marked the first time since [[1964 United States Senate elections|1964]] in which a Democratic presidential candidate won the White House with Senate coattails.  Finally, 2008 was the first presidential election year since 1948 in which Senate Class 2 saw net gains for the winning presidential candidate's party.\n\nWhen the new senators were first sworn in, the balance was 58\u201341 in favor of the Democrats, because of the [[2008 United States Senate election in Minnesota|unresolved Senate election in Minnesota]]. The April 2009 party switch of [[Arlen Specter]] from Republican to Democrat and the July 2009 resolution of the Minnesota election in favor of Democrat [[Al Franken]] increased the Democratic majority to 60\u201340. Republicans gained a seat in a [[2010 United States Senate special election in Massachusetts|January 2010 special election in Massachusetts]], making the balance 59-41 before the start of the [[2010 United States Senate elections|next election cycle]].\n\n== Gains and losses ==\nDemocrats defeated five Republican incumbents:\n\n* [[2008 United States Senate election in Alaska|Alaska]]: [[Ted Stevens]] lost to [[Mark Begich]].\n* [[2008 United States Senate election in Minnesota|Minnesota]]: [[Norm Coleman]] lost to [[Al Franken]]. The race was the subject of a protracted recount, and was not resolved until July 2009.\n* [[2008 United States Senate election in New Hampshire|New Hampshire]]: [[John E. Sununu|John Sununu]] lost to [[Jeanne Shaheen]].\n* [[2008 United States Senate election in North Carolina|North Carolina]]: [[Elizabeth Dole]] lost to [[Kay Hagan]].\n* [[2008 United States Senate election in Oregon|Oregon]]: [[Gordon Smith (politician)|Gordon Smith]] lost to [[Jeff Merkley]].\n\nDemocrats also picked up three Republican-held open seats: [[2008 United States Senate election in Colorado|Colorado]], [[2008 United States Senate election in New Mexico|New Mexico]], and [[2008 United States Senate election in Virginia|Virginia]].\n\n== Results summary ==\n\n{|

Kennedy]]'s term. His [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] made a net gain of three seats from the [[United States Republican Party|Republicans]], increasing their control of the Senate.\n\nBoth Republican-held senate seats in New Hampshire were up on election day due to a special election. The appointee lost election to a full term to the Democratic challenger while the incumbent Republican was reelected. As such, this is the last time that one of a state's two senate seats, both up on election day, that were held by the same party changed parties.\n\n== Retirements ==\nThrough open seats due to retirements, Democrats gained two seats.\n\n=== Democratic seats held by Democrats ===\n# Hawaii: [[Oren E. Long]] (D) was replaced by [[Daniel Inouye]] (D).\n# Massachusetts (Class 1): Appointee [[Benjamin A. Smith]] (D) was replaced by [[Ted Kennedy]] (D) for the last two years of the term President Kennedy was elected to in 1960\n\n=== Republicans replaced by Democrats ===\n# Connecticut: [[Prescott Bush]] (R) was replaced by [[Abraham Ribicoff]] (D)\n# Maryland: [[John Marshall Butler|John M. Butler]] (R) was replaced by [[Daniel B. Brewster]] (D)\n\n== Losing incumbents ==\nDemocrats had a net gain of two seats in election upsets.\n\n=== Democrats lost to Republicans ===\n# Colorado : [[John A. Carroll]] (D) lost to [[Peter H. Dominick]] (R)\n# Wyoming (Class 2): Appointee [[John J. Hickey]] (D) lost to [[Milward Simpson]] (R)\n\n=== Republicans lost to Democrats ===\n# Indiana: [[Homer E. Capehart]] (R) lost to [[Birch Bayh]] (D)\n# New Hampshire (Class 2): Appointee [[Maurice J. Murphy Jr.]] (R) lost renomination to [[Perkins Bass]] (R).  Bass lost the general election to [[Thomas J. McIntyre]] (D).\n# South Dakota: Appointee [[Joseph H. Bottum]] (R) lost to [[George S. McGovern]] (D)\n# Wisconsin: [[Alexander Wiley]] (R) lost to [[Gaylord Nelson]] (D)\n\n== Other changes ==\nThe Democrats' four-seat net gain was reduced by one seat between the election and the next Congress.\n\n# New Mexico: On November 18, 1962, Democrat [[Dennis Chavez]], who was not up for election that year, died.  He was replaced on November 30, 1962 by Republican appointee [[Edwin L. Mechem]].\n\n== Subsequent changes ==\n* September 16, 1964: South Carolina \u2014 [[Strom Thurmond]] switched parties from Democratic to Republican.\n\n== Change in Senate composition ==\n=== Before

Johnston]] defeated [[Governor of South Carolina|Governor]] [[Ernest Hollings|Fritz Hollings]] in the Democratic primary and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[W. D. Workman Jr.]] in the general election.  The [[South Carolina Democratic Party]] held their [[Primary election|primary]] on June 12, 1962.  [[Olin D. Johnston]], the incumbent [[United States Senate|Senator]], faced stiff competition from [[Governor of South Carolina|Governor]] [[Ernest Hollings|Fritz Hollings]] who argued that Johnston was too liberal and not representative of South Carolina interests.  Johnston merely told the voters that he was doing what he thought was best for the agriculture and textile workers of the state.  Hollings was decisively defeated by Johnston because Johnston used his position as [[United States Senate Committee on Post Office and Civil Service|Post Office and Civil Service Committee]] to build 40 new post offices in the state and thus demonstrate the pull he had in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] to bring home the bacon.\n\n{{Election box begin no change\n | title= Democratic primary}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link no change\n   |party      = Democratic Party (US)\n   |candidate  = [[Olin D.

D. Workman Jr.]], a correspondent for the ''[[The Post and Courier|News and Courier]]'', faced no opposition from [[South Carolina Republican Party|South Carolina Republicans]] and avoided a [[primary election]].\n\nBoth Johnston and Workman supported [[Racial segregation|segregation]], so the campaign centered on the economic issues of the state.  Workman tried to persuade the voters that Johnston's policies were socialist and that he was too closely aligned with the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] administration.  Johnston was a consistent supporter of socialized health care proposals and Workman was able to win considerable support from the medical establishment.  However, the state's citizens were much poorer than that of the rest of the nation and Johnston's class based appeals made him a very popular figure for the downtrodden of both the white and black races.  The competitive nature of this race foresaw the eventual rise of the Republican Party and that South Carolinians were growing increasingly suspicious of policies generated at the federal level.\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      =South Carolina U.S. Senate Election, 1962\n}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Olin D.

Kennedy]]'s term. His [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] made a net gain of three seats from the [[United States Republican Party|Republicans]], increasing their control of the Senate.\n\nBoth Republican-held senate seats in New Hampshire were up on election day due to a special election. The appointee lost election to a full term to the Democratic challenger while the incumbent Republican was reelected. As such, this is the last time that one of a state's two senate seats, both up on election day, that were held by the same party changed parties.\n\n== Retirements ==\nThrough open seats due to retirements, Democrats gained two seats.\n\n=== Democratic seats held by Democrats ===\n# Hawaii: [[Oren E. Long]] (D) was replaced by [[Daniel Inouye]] (D).\n# Massachusetts (Class 1): Appointee [[Benjamin A. Smith]] (D) was replaced by [[Ted Kennedy]] (D) for the last two years of the term President Kennedy was elected to in 1960\n\n=== Republicans replaced by Democrats ===\n# Connecticut: [[Prescott Bush]] (R) was replaced by [[Abraham Ribicoff]] (D)\n# Maryland: [[John Marshall Butler|John M. Butler]] (R) was replaced by [[Daniel B. Brewster]] (D)\n\n== Losing incumbents ==\nDemocrats had a net gain of two seats in election upsets.\n\n=== Democrats lost to Republicans ===\n# Colorado : [[John A. Carroll]] (D) lost to [[Peter H. Dominick]] (R)\n# Wyoming (Class 2): Appointee [[John J. Hickey]] (D) lost to [[Milward Simpson]] (R)\n\n=== Republicans lost to Democrats ===\n# Indiana: [[Homer E. Capehart]] (R) lost to [[Birch Bayh]] (D)\n# New Hampshire (Class 2): Appointee [[Maurice J. Murphy Jr.]] (R) lost renomination to [[Perkins Bass]] (R).  Bass lost the general election to [[Thomas J. McIntyre]] (D).\n# South Dakota: Appointee [[Joseph H. Bottum]] (R) lost to [[George S. McGovern]] (D)\n# Wisconsin: [[Alexander Wiley]] (R) lost to [[Gaylord Nelson]] (D)\n\n== Other changes ==\nThe Democrats' four-seat net gain was reduced by one seat between the election and the next Congress.\n\n# New Mexico: On November 18, 1962, Democrat [[Dennis Chavez]], who was not up for election that year, died.  He was replaced on November 30, 1962 by Republican appointee [[Edwin L. Mechem]].\n\n== Subsequent changes ==\n* September 16, 1964: South Carolina \u2014 [[Strom Thurmond]] switched parties from Democratic to Republican.\n\n== Change in Senate composition ==\n=== Before

Johnston]] defeated [[Governor of South Carolina|Governor]] [[Ernest Hollings|Fritz Hollings]] in the Democratic primary and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[W. D. Workman Jr.]] in the general election.  The [[South Carolina Democratic Party]] held their [[Primary election|primary]] on June 12, 1962.  [[Olin D. Johnston]], the incumbent [[United States Senate|Senator]], faced stiff competition from [[Governor of South Carolina|Governor]] [[Ernest Hollings|Fritz Hollings]] who argued that Johnston was too liberal and not representative of South Carolina interests.  Johnston merely told the voters that he was doing what he thought was best for the agriculture and textile workers of the state.  Hollings was decisively defeated by Johnston because Johnston used his position as [[United States Senate Committee on Post Office and Civil Service|Post Office and Civil Service Committee]] to build 40 new post offices in the state and thus demonstrate the pull he had in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] to bring home the bacon.\n\n{{Election box begin no change\n | title= Democratic primary}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link no change\n   |party      = Democratic Party (US)\n   |candidate  = [[Olin D.

D. Workman Jr.]], a correspondent for the ''[[The Post and Courier|News and Courier]]'', faced no opposition from [[South Carolina Republican Party|South Carolina Republicans]] and avoided a [[primary election]].\n\nBoth Johnston and Workman supported [[Racial segregation|segregation]], so the campaign centered on the economic issues of the state.  Workman tried to persuade the voters that Johnston's policies were socialist and that he was too closely aligned with the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] administration.  Johnston was a consistent supporter of socialized health care proposals and Workman was able to win considerable support from the medical establishment.  However, the state's citizens were much poorer than that of the rest of the nation and Johnston's class based appeals made him a very popular figure for the downtrodden of both the white and black races.  The competitive nature of this race foresaw the eventual rise of the Republican Party and that South Carolinians were growing increasingly suspicious of policies generated at the federal level.\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      =South Carolina U.S. Senate Election, 1962\n}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Olin D.

Eisenhower]]'s second term. As is common in [[midterm elections]], the party in the White House lost seats, but losses this year were more than usual, perhaps due to the high unemployment of the [[Recession of 1958]]. The [[Eisenhower Administration]]'s position on [[Right-to-work law|right-to-work issues]] galvanized labor unions which supported Democrats. The launch of [[Sputnik]] may also have been a factor.\n\nThe [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] took 12 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] seats and a special election seat (10 of them by defeating incumbents), and also won both Senate seats in the new state of Alaska.  Senate elections in 1959 in the new state of Hawaii were split between the two parties; combined with the 1958 results, this yielded an aggregate gain of 16 seats for the Democrats for a party balance of 65-35. This is the largest swing in the history of the Senate, and is only the second time in U.S. history that 10 or more Senate seats changed hands in a midterm election (after [[United States Senate elections, 1946|1946]]).  This election featured the most incumbent Republicans defeated since Senators were first popularly elected.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n== New seats ==\n\n=== New Democratic seats ===\n# Alaska (class 2): won by [[Bob Bartlett]]\n# Alaska (class 3): won by [[Ernest Gruening]]\n\n== Incumbents retiring ==\n\n=== Democrats ===\nNo Democrats retired.\n\n=== Republican seats held by Republicans ===\n# New York: [[Irving M.

Eisenhower]]'s second term. As is common in [[midterm elections]], the party in the White House lost seats, but losses this year were more than usual, perhaps due to the high unemployment of the [[Recession of 1958]]. The [[Eisenhower Administration]]'s position on [[Right-to-work law|right-to-work issues]] galvanized labor unions which supported Democrats. The launch of [[Sputnik]] may also have been a factor.\n\nThe [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] took 12 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] seats and a special election seat (10 of them by defeating incumbents), and also won both Senate seats in the new state of Alaska.  Senate elections in 1959 in the new state of Hawaii were split between the two parties; combined with the 1958 results, this yielded an aggregate gain of 16 seats for the Democrats for a party balance of 65-35. This is the largest swing in the history of the Senate, and is only the second time in U.S. history that 10 or more Senate seats changed hands in a midterm election (after [[United States Senate elections, 1946|1946]]).  This election featured the most incumbent Republicans defeated since Senators were first popularly elected.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n== New seats ==\n\n=== New Democratic seats ===\n# Alaska (class 2): won by [[Bob Bartlett]]\n# Alaska (class 3): won by [[Ernest Gruening]]\n\n== Incumbents retiring ==\n\n=== Democrats ===\nNo Democrats retired.\n\n=== Republican seats held by Republicans ===\n# New York: [[Irving M.

Barry was an architect for the city government and [[Orange County, New York]] when he came up with the idea of a city greenmarket to solve the problem of loss of [[farmland]] in the metropolitan area because small farmers could not compete with large-scale commercial farms anymore and they had begun to sell their land to real estate developers. Due to loss of farmland the food being produced on the small regional farms was not making it into New York City causing a lack of fresh, decent food in the city.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thrasher|first=Dory  Kornfeld|title=Bringing Good Food In: A History of New York City&#39;s Greenmarket Program|url=https://www.academia.edu/7583279/Bringing_Good_Food_In_A_History_of_New_York_Citys_Greenmarket_Program|language=en}}</ref><ref>The New Yorker. \"A Reporter at Large: Giving Good Weight\". p. 51</ref> The problem is further explained in \"The Cornucopia Project\" that details how from 1960 to 1980 the number of farms decreased by 28 percent and the land in farms by 19.5%.<ref>Messing, Patricia(1981). \"The Cornucopia Project The New York State Food System: Growing Closer to Home.\" The Cornucopia Project of Rodale Press: Emmaus, PA.</ref>\n\nBarry became the project director of the Greenmarket for the Council on the Environment of New York City (now GrowNYC) when they got involved in implementing his idea of the first city greenmarket.\n\nThe following organizations donated to Barry's idea: America the Beautiful Fund gave $800, the J.M.

The Union Square Market opened on August 30, 1976 and the Brooklyn Farmers Market opened on September 1. \"Site ownership affected the total cost, while the Brooklyn site required a monthly rental fee, the two publicly owned sites in Manhattan were free, but required long, difficult, costly regulations\".<ref>Benepe, Barry. \"Greenmarket: The Rebirth of Farmers Markets in New York City\".

There are many organizations that needed to be consulted with in order to have made this possible: community boards, zoning committees, local merchants, the office of the [[Mayor of New York City]] and more.<ref>The New Yorker. \"A Reporter at Large: Giving Good Weight\". p. 51</ref> The first farmers market in New York City was at [[59th Street (Manhattan)|59th Street]] and [[Second Avenue (Manhattan)|Second Avenue]] and opened Saturday, July 17, 1976, and it is conceived by Barry Benepe, an urban planner who grew up in a small family farm in Maryland .<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thrasher|first=Dory  Kornfeld|title=Bringing Good Food In: A History of New York City&#39;s Greenmarket Program|url=https://www.academia.edu/7583279/Bringing_Good_Food_In_A_History_of_New_York_Citys_Greenmarket_Program|language=en}}</ref><ref>Benepe, Barry. \"Greenmarket: The Rebirth of Farmers Markets in New York City\". The Council on the Environment of New York City: NY, NY. p. 5</ref> In early 1976, Barry Benepe did a written proposal to finance New York City's first Greenmarket. Barry was an architect for the city government and [[Orange County, New York]] when he came up with the idea of a city greenmarket to solve the problem of loss of [[farmland]] in the metropolitan area because small farmers could not compete with large-scale commercial farms anymore and they had begun to sell their land to real estate developers. Due to loss of farmland the food being produced on the small regional farms was not making it into New York City causing a lack of fresh, decent food in the city.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thrasher|first=Dory  Kornfeld|title=Bringing Good Food In: A History of New York City&#39;s Greenmarket Program|url=https://www.academia.edu/7583279/Bringing_Good_Food_In_A_History_of_New_York_Citys_Greenmarket_Program|language=en}}</ref><ref>The New Yorker. \"A Reporter at Large: Giving Good Weight\". p. 51</ref> The problem is further explained in \"The Cornucopia Project\" that details how from 1960 to 1980 the number of farms decreased by 28 percent and the land in farms by 19.5%.<ref>Messing, Patricia(1981). \"The Cornucopia Project The New York State Food System: Growing Closer to Home.\" The Cornucopia Project of Rodale Press: Emmaus, PA.</ref>\n\nBarry became the project director of the Greenmarket for the Council on the Environment of New York City (now GrowNYC) when they got involved in implementing his idea of the first city greenmarket.\n\nThe following organizations donated to Barry's idea: America the Beautiful Fund gave $800, the J.M. Kaplan Fund gave $10,000, the Fund for the City of New York gave $5,000 the [[Vincent Astor]] Foundation gave $10,000 and other public officials including Consumer Affairs Commissioner Elinor Guggenheim.<ref>Benepe, Barry. \"Greenmarket: The Rebirth of Farmers Markets in New York City\". The Council on the Environment of New York City: NY, NY. p. 6</ref> On July 17, seven farmers from \"[[Long Island]], [[New Jersey]] and upstate New York\" participated in selling at the first greenmarket which quickly became successful.\n\n[[New York City Department of City Planning]] proposed to open a second farmers market at [[Union Square, Manhattan#Greenmarkets and businesses|Union Square]] and a third one in [[Brooklyn]]. The Union Square Marker opened on August 30, 1976 and the Brooklyn Farmers Market opened on September 1. \"Site ownership affected the total cost, while the Brooklyn site required a monthly rental fee, the two publicly owned sites in Manhattan were free, but required long, difficult, costly regulations\".<ref>Benepe, Barry. \"Greenmarket: The Rebirth of Farmers Markets in New York City\". The Council on the Environment of New York City: NY, NY. p. 13</ref> In Brooklyn the site owner was the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]]. In order to cover these costs, farmers were charged a fee based on truck size and market location.\n\nOther than fees, farmers were required to be certified by the County Extension Agent, posts reasonable prices, use scales, have a sign indication of farm name and location and cleaning up the selling space at the end of the day.<ref>Benepe, Barry. \"Greenmarket: The Rebirth of Farmers Markets in New York City\".

Horrell campaigned for the seat. Horrell researched Pepper's weaknesses and the state's voters. Horrell also compiled a list of communist-front groups that Pepper had communicated with. On the day that Pepper declared his candidacy, Horrell withdrew and endorsed Smathers. Horrell also sent his reports about Pepper to Smathers, which he used throughout the next few months. This would also prevent the chance of a run-off election. In late February and early March, the ''[[Jacksonville Journal]]'' conducted a poll in 11&nbsp;[[List of counties in Florida|counties]] important for the election. Smathers led by about 2-to-1 and dominated in [[Duval County, Florida|Duval]], [[Pinellas County, Florida|Pinellas]], and [[Volusia County, Florida|Volusia]] counties, while he was also statistically tied with Pepper in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade]], [[Escambia County, Florida|Escambia]], and [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough]] counties. However, Smathers did not trail in any of the 11&nbsp;counties.<ref name=\"clark\">{{cite thesis|author=James C.

Pepper had traveled to the Soviet Union in 1945 and, after meeting Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]], declared he was \"a man Americans could trust.\"<ref name=johnfund>Fund, John. ''Political Journal: George Smathers, RIP'', January 24, 2007.</ref> Additionally, although Pepper supported universal health care, sometimes referred to as \"socialized medicine\", Smathers voted for \"socialized medicine\" in the senate when it was introduced as [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] in 1965. In ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', even respected writer and notorious [[Racial segregation|anti-segregation]] editor [[Ralph McGill]] labeled Pepper a \"spell-binding [[pinko]]\".<ref name=\"gorey\"/> Beginning on March 28 and until the day of the primary, Smathers named one communist organization each day that Pepper addressed, starting with the American Slav Congress.<ref name=\"clark\"/>\n\nPepper's opponents circulated widely a 49-page booklet titled ''The Red Record of Senator Claude Pepper''. It contained photographs and headlines from several communist publications such as the ''[[Daily Worker]]''.<ref name=\"gorey\"/> In April the ''Daily Worker'' endorsed Pepper, with Communist Party of Florida leader George Nelson warning that a Smathers victory would \"strengthen the Dixiecrat-KKK forces in Florida as well as throughout the South.\"<ref name=\"clark\"/> The booklet also made it seem as if Pepper desired to give Russia nuclear bomb-making instructions, billions of dollars, and the United States' natural resources. There was also a double page montage of Pepper in 1946 at [[New York City]]'s [[Madison Square Garden]] with [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|progressive]] [[Henry A. Wallace]] and civil rights activist [[Paul Robeson]], and quoted Pepper speaking favorably of both of them.<ref name=\"gorey\"/> Throughout the campaign, Pepper denied sympathizing with communism.<ref name=\"pepperconcedes\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Bl8pAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NsgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4132%2C4646906|title=Pepper Concedes It; Miamian's Lead Nears 70,000|date=May 3, 1950|newspaper=[[The Daytona Beach News-Journal]]|agency=Associated Press|location=Miami, Florida|accessdate=December 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\nSimultaneous to this election, then-U.S. House Representative [[Richard Nixon]] was [[United States Senate election in California, 1950|running for the senate seat]] in [[California]]. In a letter from Senator [[Karl E. Mundt]] of [[South Dakota]], he told Nixon that \"It occurs to me that if Helen is your opponent in the fall, something of a similar nature might well be produced\", in reference to ''The Red Record of Senator Claude Pepper'' and a similar Democratic primary between [[Manchester Boddy]] and [[Helen Gahagan Douglas]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Karl E.

Labor unions began a voter registration drive, which mostly added African Americans to the voter rolls. Smathers accused the \"Northern labor bosses\" of paying black people to register and vote for Pepper. Shortly after Smathers declared his candidacy, he indicated to the Florida Peace Officers Association that he would defend law enforcement officers for free if they were found guilty of civil rights violations.<ref name=\"gorey\"/> With the election occurring during the era of [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]], Pepper was portrayed as favoring integration and interracial marriage. He was also labeled a \"nigger lover\" and accused by ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' publisher Martin Andersen of shaking hands with a black woman in [[Sanford, Florida|Sanford]]. In [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County]], which had a significant black and Jewish population, doctored photographs depicting Smathers in a [[Ku Klux Klan]] hood were distributed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1998-12-13/news/9812110957_1_george-smathers-martin-andersen-pepper|date=December 13, 1998|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|last=Andrews|first=Mark|title=U.s.

Thomas fled the area but was later shot and killed by police. Greenlee, Irvin, and Shepherd were convicted by an all-white jury. After the ''[[Tampa Bay Times|St. Petersburg Times]]'' questioned the verdict in April 1950, [[Lake County, Florida|Lake County]] State Attorney J. W. Hunter, a supporter of Pepper, demanded that Pepper repudiate the news articles. However, Pepper refused. Hunter then denounced Pepper and endorsed Smathers. In addition to the racial violence, [[cross burning]] was also common at the time, with five in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], ten in Orlando and [[Winter Park, Florida|Winter Park]], and seventeen in the [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]] [[Tallahassee metropolitan area|area]].<ref name=\"clark\"/>\n\nWith the accusation of \"Northern labor bosses\" sending \"the carpetbaggers of 1950\" to Florida on his behalf, Pepper reminded voters that Smathers was born in [[New Jersey]] and sometimes referred to him as a \"damn Yankee intruder\". In response, Smathers decorated speaking platform in the colors of his alma mater at the [[University of Florida]], orange and blue, while informing his supporters that Pepper graduated from [[Harvard Law School]].<ref name=\"gorey\"/>\n\nPowers noted that throughout the campaign, \"scarcely a day passed\" without Andersen writing a news story, column, or editorial that was very positive of Smathers or highly critical of Pepper.<ref name=\"os2000\"/> Thirty-eight daily newspapers in Florida endorsed Smathers, while only the ''St. Petersburg Times'' and ''[[The Daytona Beach News-Journal]]'' endorsed Pepper. Among the newspapers that supported Smathers were the ''[[Miami Herald]]'', owned by [[John S. Knight]], and the ''[[The Miami News|Miami Daily News]]'', published by [[James M. Cox]], a former [[Governor of Ohio]] and the Democratic Party nominee for the [[1920 United States presidential election|1920 presidential election]]. However, Pepper's aides compared this situation to when [[Alf Landon]] was endorsed by more editors and newspapers than Franklin Roosevelt in [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]], but received far fewer votes than him.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|title=Pepper-vs.-Smathers Race Close; Reds Issue in Florida Senate Drive|date=April 6, 1950|location=Lake Wales, Florida}}</ref>\n\nSmathers performed generally well across many areas of the state, with the exception of [[Miami]], [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], and the [[Florida Panhandle]]. On the morning after the election, Andersen wrote on the front-page headline of the ''Orlando Sentinel'', \"Praise God From Whom All Blessings Flow ... We Have Won from Hell to Breakfast And From Dan to Beersheba ... And Staved Off Socialism\", which was inspired by a  headline in ''[[The New York Times]]'' celebrating [[T. E.

Truman]]'s second term as President. As with most 20th-century second-term mid-terms, the party out of the Presidency made significant gains. The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] opposition made a net gain of five seats, taking advantage of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] administration's declining popularity during the [[Cold War]] and the aftermath of the [[Recession of 1949]]. The Democrats held a narrow 49 to 47 seat majority after the election. This became the first time since [[1932 United States Senate elections|1932]] that the Senate Majority Leader lost his seat and the only instance where the majority leader lost his seat while his party retained the majority.\n\n== Gains and losses ==\n[[File:Nixon victory dinner ticket.jpg|thumb|right|Ticket to a victory dinner for [[Richard Nixon]] at the [[William Penn Hotel (San Diego)|Wm.

On January 12, 1950, U.S. Representative [[George A.

Horrell campaigned for the seat. Horrell researched Pepper's weaknesses and the state's voters. Horrell also compiled a list of communist-front groups that Pepper had communicated with. On the day that Pepper declared his candidacy, Horrell withdrew and endorsed Smathers. Horrell also sent his reports about Pepper to Smathers, which he used throughout the next few months. This would also prevent the chance of a run-off election. In late February and early March, the ''[[Jacksonville Journal]]'' conducted a poll in 11&nbsp;[[List of counties in Florida|counties]] important for the election. Smathers led by about 2-to-1 and dominated in [[Duval County, Florida|Duval]], [[Pinellas County, Florida|Pinellas]], and [[Volusia County, Florida|Volusia]] counties, while he was also statistically tied with Pepper in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade]], [[Escambia County, Florida|Escambia]], and [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough]] counties. However, Smathers did not trail in any of the 11&nbsp;counties.<ref name=\"clark\">{{cite thesis|author=James C.

Pepper had traveled to the Soviet Union in 1945 and, after meeting Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]], declared he was \"a man Americans could trust.\"<ref name=johnfund>Fund, John. ''Political Journal: George Smathers, RIP'', January 24, 2007.</ref> Additionally, although Pepper supported universal health care, sometimes referred to as \"socialized medicine\", Smathers voted for \"socialized medicine\" in the senate when it was introduced as [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] in 1965. In ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', even respected writer and notorious [[Racial segregation|anti-segregation]] editor [[Ralph McGill]] labeled Pepper a \"spell-binding [[pinko]]\".<ref name=\"gorey\"/> Beginning on March 28 and until the day of the primary, Smathers named one communist organization each day that Pepper addressed, starting with the American Slav Congress.<ref name=\"clark\"/>\n\nPepper's opponents circulated widely a 49-page booklet titled ''The Red Record of Senator Claude Pepper''. It contained photographs and headlines from several communist publications such as the ''[[Daily Worker]]''.<ref name=\"gorey\"/> In April the ''Daily Worker'' endorsed Pepper, with Communist Party of Florida leader George Nelson warning that a Smathers victory would \"strengthen the Dixiecrat-KKK forces in Florida as well as throughout the South.\"<ref name=\"clark\"/> The booklet also made it seem as if Pepper desired to give Russia nuclear bomb-making instructions, billions of dollars, and the United States' natural resources. There was also a double page montage of Pepper in 1946 at [[New York City]]'s [[Madison Square Garden]] with [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|progressive]] [[Henry A. Wallace]] and civil rights activist [[Paul Robeson]], and quoted Pepper speaking favorably of both of them.<ref name=\"gorey\"/> Throughout the campaign, Pepper denied sympathizing with communism.<ref name=\"pepperconcedes\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Bl8pAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NsgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4132%2C4646906|title=Pepper Concedes It; Miamian's Lead Nears 70,000|date=May 3, 1950|newspaper=[[The Daytona Beach News-Journal]]|agency=Associated Press|location=Miami, Florida|accessdate=December 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\nSimultaneous to this election, then-U.S. House Representative [[Richard Nixon]] was [[United States Senate election in California, 1950|running for the senate seat]] in [[California]]. In a letter from Senator [[Karl E. Mundt]] of [[South Dakota]], he told Nixon that \"It occurs to me that if Helen is your opponent in the fall, something of a similar nature might well be produced\", in reference to ''The Red Record of Senator Claude Pepper'' and a similar Democratic primary between [[Manchester Boddy]] and [[Helen Gahagan Douglas]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Karl E.

Labor unions began a voter registration drive, which mostly added African Americans to the voter rolls. Smathers accused the \"Northern labor bosses\" of paying black people to register and vote for Pepper. Shortly after Smathers declared his candidacy, he indicated to the Florida Peace Officers Association that he would defend law enforcement officers for free if they were found guilty of civil rights violations.<ref name=\"gorey\"/> With the election occurring during the era of [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]], Pepper was portrayed as favoring integration and interracial marriage. He was also labeled a \"nigger lover\" and accused by ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' publisher Martin Andersen of shaking hands with a black woman in [[Sanford, Florida|Sanford]]. In [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County]], which had a significant black and Jewish population, doctored photographs depicting Smathers in a [[Ku Klux Klan]] hood were distributed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1998-12-13/news/9812110957_1_george-smathers-martin-andersen-pepper|date=December 13, 1998|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|last=Andrews|first=Mark|title=U.s.

Thomas fled the area but was later shot and killed by police. Greenlee, Irvin, and Shepherd were convicted by an all-white jury. After the ''[[Tampa Bay Times|St. Petersburg Times]]'' questioned the verdict in April 1950, [[Lake County, Florida|Lake County]] State Attorney J. W. Hunter, a supporter of Pepper, demanded that Pepper repudiate the news articles. However, Pepper refused. Hunter then denounced Pepper and endorsed Smathers. In addition to the racial violence, [[cross burning]] was also common at the time, with five in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], ten in Orlando and [[Winter Park, Florida|Winter Park]], and seventeen in the [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]] [[Tallahassee metropolitan area|area]].<ref name=\"clark\"/>\n\nWith the accusation of \"Northern labor bosses\" sending \"the carpetbaggers of 1950\" to Florida on his behalf, Pepper reminded voters that Smathers was born in [[New Jersey]] and sometimes referred to him as a \"damn Yankee intruder\". In response, Smathers decorated speaking platform in the colors of his alma mater at the [[University of Florida]], orange and blue, while informing his supporters that Pepper graduated from [[Harvard Law School]].<ref name=\"gorey\"/>\n\nPowers noted that throughout the campaign, \"scarcely a day passed\" without Andersen writing a news story, column, or editorial that was very positive of Smathers or highly critical of Pepper.<ref name=\"os2000\"/> Thirty-eight daily newspapers in Florida endorsed Smathers, while only the ''St. Petersburg Times'' and ''[[The Daytona Beach News-Journal]]'' endorsed Pepper. Among the newspapers that supported Smathers were the ''[[Miami Herald]]'', owned by [[John S. Knight]], and the ''[[The Miami News|Miami Daily News]]'', published by [[James M. Cox]], a former [[Governor of Ohio]] and the Democratic Party nominee for the [[1920 United States presidential election|1920 presidential election]]. However, Pepper's aides compared this situation to when [[Alf Landon]] was endorsed by more editors and newspapers than Franklin Roosevelt in [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]], but received far fewer votes than him.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|title=Pepper-vs.-Smathers Race Close; Reds Issue in Florida Senate Drive|date=April 6, 1950|location=Lake Wales, Florida}}</ref>\n\nSmathers performed generally well across many areas of the state, with the exception of [[Miami]], [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], and the [[Florida Panhandle]]. On the morning after the election, Andersen wrote on the front-page headline of the ''Orlando Sentinel'', \"Praise God From Whom All Blessings Flow ... We Have Won from Hell to Breakfast And From Dan to Beersheba ... And Staved Off Socialism\", which was inspired by a  headline in ''[[The New York Times]]'' celebrating [[T. E.
