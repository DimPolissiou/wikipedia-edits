His transfer was prompted by an accident that caused him to reconsider his life. He was unexpectedly appointed to the position of Chief of Trauma Team Alpha over veteran surgeon Eva Zambrano. He is an Attending Trauma Physician.\n\nEva Zambrano, MD, FACS ([[Lana Parrilla]])\n: Eva is an Attending Trauma Physician and the Deputy Chief of Trauma Team Alpha. Her father was a trauma surgeon in Cuba, but when they defected on a raft when Zambrano was six, his ego would not allow him to begin his career again as a resident. Despite being next-in-line to run Alpha Team, she is unexpectedly pitted-to-the-post by Procter.\n\nChris Deleo, MD, FACS ([[Mike Vogel]])\n: Chris, known as \"C\" to his colleagues, is three-years Eva's junior, though still felt he was a viable candidate for the vacant Chief position. During season one, he had been a member of Alpha for two-and-a-half years. He is an Attending Physician.\n\nSerena Warren, MD ([[Elisabeth Harnois]])\n: Serena is a resident assigned to the trauma surgery service, and as such is far more idealistic than her older colleagues. Warren often exhibits an inability to deliver bad news to patients. She is incredibly claustrophobic.\n\nTuck Brody, RN ([[Omar Gooding]])\n: Tuck is a Nurse assigned to Trauma. He is often seen giving emotional and moral support to patients, families, and doctors. During season one, Tuck is stabbed, though he later makes a full recovery.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table |total_width=99 |background=#03C03C |overall= |title= |director= |writer= |airdate= |prodcode= |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber   = 1\n|Title           = Pilot\n|DirectedBy      = [[Kenneth Fink]]\n|WrittenBy       = [[Jeffrey Lieber]]\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2010|4|2}}\n|ProdCode        = S90431\n|ShortSummary    = The team is aided by a new surgeon; a restaurant explosion sends many victims to the hospital.\n|LineColor       = 03C03C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber   = 2\n|Title           = 88 Seconds\n|DirectedBy      = [[Paul McCrane]]\n|WrittenBy       = [[Steven Maeda]]\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2010|4|9}}\n|ProdCode        = 2J5201\n|ShortSummary    = A member of the team learns a secret about Dr. Proctor while treating victims of a hotel shooting; Dr. Deleo receives a prestigious offer.\n|LineColor       = 03C03C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber   = 3\n|Title           = What Lies Beneath\n|DirectedBy      = [[John Behring]]\n|WrittenBy       = Liz Kruger & [[Craig Shapiro]]\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2010|4|16}}\n|ProdCode        = 2J5203\n|ShortSummary    = Members of a wedding party are rushed to the hospital; Zambrano and Deleo's flirtation draws attention from the hospital staff.\n|LineColor       = 03C03C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber   = 4\n|Title           = All Fall Down\n|DirectedBy      = [[Danny Cannon]]\n|WrittenBy       = Elle Triedman\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2010|4|23}}\n|ProdCode        = 2J5205\n|ShortSummary    = A woman injured in a balcony collapse refuses treatment; a patient arrives at the hospital with a large sum of money.\n|LineColor       = 03C03C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber   = 5\n|Title           = Golden Hour\n|DirectedBy      = [[Matt Earl Beesley]]\n|WrittenBy       = ''Story by:'' Jeffrey Lieber & Scott Shapiro<br />''Teleplay by:'' Jeffrey Lieber\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2010|4|30}}\n|ProdCode        = 2J5212\n|ShortSummary    = Dr. Proctor must give a speech illustrating how vital his team is in the minutes after a major accident.\n|LineColor       = 03C03C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber   = 6\n|Title           = Calle Cubana\n|DirectedBy      = [[Nathan Hope]]\n|WrittenBy       = Pamela Davis\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2010|5|7}}\n|ProdCode        = 2J5206\n|ShortSummary    = When a city celebration turns violent, the Alpha Team faces an increased workload; Dr. Zambrano takes a special interest in a teenager left for dead outside the hospital.\n|LineColor       = 03C03C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber   = 7\n|Title           = Man on the Road\n|DirectedBy      = [[Eagle Egilsson]]\n|WrittenBy       = Jeffrey Lieber\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2010|5|14}}\n|ProdCode        = 2J5207\n|ShortSummary    = As the doctors wait for news of their friend's condition, they treat victims of a motorcycle accident and a small plane crash.\n|LineColor       = 03C03C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber   = 8\n|Title           = An Arm and a Leg\n|DirectedBy      = [[Paris Barclay]]\n|WrittenBy       = [[Christina M.

His transfer was prompted by an accident that caused him to reconsider his life. He was unexpectedly appointed to the position of Chief of Trauma Team Alpha over veteran surgeon Eva Zambrano. He is an Attending Trauma Physician.\n\nEva Zambrano, MD, FACS ([[Lana Parrilla]])\n: Eva is an Attending Trauma Physician and the Deputy Chief of Trauma Team Alpha. Her father was a trauma surgeon in Cuba, but when they defected on a raft when Zambrano was six, his ego would not allow him to begin his career again as a resident. Despite being next-in-line to run Alpha Team, she is unexpectedly pitted-to-the-post by Procter.\n\nChris Deleo, MD, FACS ([[Mike Vogel]])\n: Chris, known as \"C\" to his colleagues, is three-years Eva's junior, though still felt he was a viable candidate for the vacant Chief position. During season one, he had been a member of Alpha for two-and-a-half years. He is an Attending Physician.\n\nSerena Warren, MD ([[Elisabeth Harnois]])\n: Serena is a resident assigned to the trauma surgery service, and as such is far more idealistic than her older colleagues. Warren often exhibits an inability to deliver bad news to patients. She is incredibly claustrophobic.\n\nTuck Brody, RN ([[Omar Gooding]])\n: Tuck is a Nurse assigned to Trauma. He is often seen giving emotional and moral support to patients, families, and doctors. During season one, Tuck is stabbed, though he later makes a full recovery.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table |total_width=99 |background=#03C03C |overall= |title= |director= |writer= |airdate= |prodcode= |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber   = 1\n|Title           = Pilot\n|DirectedBy      = [[Kenneth Fink]]\n|WrittenBy       = [[Jeffrey Lieber]]\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2010|4|2}}\n|ProdCode        = S90431\n|ShortSummary    = The team is aided by a new surgeon; a restaurant explosion sends many victims to the hospital.\n|LineColor       = 03C03C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber   = 2\n|Title           = 88 Seconds\n|DirectedBy      = [[Paul McCrane]]\n|WrittenBy       = [[Steven Maeda]]\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2010|4|9}}\n|ProdCode        = 2J5201\n|ShortSummary    = A member of the team learns a secret about Dr. Proctor while treating victims of a hotel shooting; Dr. Deleo receives a prestigious offer.\n|LineColor       = 03C03C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber   = 3\n|Title           = What Lies Beneath\n|DirectedBy      = [[John Behring]]\n|WrittenBy       = Liz Kruger & [[Craig Shapiro]]\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2010|4|16}}\n|ProdCode        = 2J5203\n|ShortSummary    = Members of a wedding party are rushed to the hospital; Zambrano and Deleo's flirtation draws attention from the hospital staff.\n|LineColor       = 03C03C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber   = 4\n|Title           = All Fall Down\n|DirectedBy      = [[Danny Cannon]]\n|WrittenBy       = Elle Triedman\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2010|4|23}}\n|ProdCode        = 2J5205\n|ShortSummary    = A woman injured in a balcony collapse refuses treatment; a patient arrives at the hospital with a large sum of money.\n|LineColor       = 03C03C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber   = 5\n|Title           = Golden Hour\n|DirectedBy      = [[Matt Earl Beesley]]\n|WrittenBy       = ''Story by:'' Jeffrey Lieber & Scott Shapiro<br />''Teleplay by:'' Jeffrey Lieber\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2010|4|30}}\n|ProdCode        = 2J5212\n|ShortSummary    = Dr. Proctor must give a speech illustrating how vital his team is in the minutes after a major accident.\n|LineColor       = 03C03C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber   = 6\n|Title           = Calle Cubana\n|DirectedBy      = [[Nathan Hope]]\n|WrittenBy       = Pamela Davis\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2010|5|7}}\n|ProdCode        = 2J5206\n|ShortSummary    = When a city celebration turns violent, the Alpha Team faces an increased workload; Dr. Zambrano takes a special interest in a teenager left for dead outside the hospital.\n|LineColor       = 03C03C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber   = 7\n|Title           = Man on the Road\n|DirectedBy      = [[Eagle Egilsson]]\n|WrittenBy       = Jeffrey Lieber\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2010|5|14}}\n|ProdCode        = 2J5207\n|ShortSummary    = As the doctors wait for news of their friend's condition, they treat victims of a motorcycle accident and a small plane crash.\n|LineColor       = 03C03C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber   = 8\n|Title           = An Arm and a Leg\n|DirectedBy      = [[Paris Barclay]]\n|WrittenBy       = [[Christina M.

It was based in [[Hamburg]] and opened its first store in 1978 in [[Luxembourg]] under the name b\u00e2tiself. Initially owned by ASKO, the chain became a division of [[Metro AG]] after the merger of ASKO with Metro Cash & Carry in 1995. It was spun off under the name Praktiker Holding in November 2005 and listed on the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archiv.metrogroup.de/en/legal-announcements/2005/10/27/metro-ag-prepares-for-praktikers-ipo |title=METRO AG prepares for Praktiker's IPO |publisher=Metro AG |date=27 October 2005}}</ref> Since 2006 until 2011 was listed on [[MDAX]] and since 2011 until 2013 on [[SDAX]].\n\nIn contrast to most of its German competitors, the company grew up by buying up various small DIY chains and building material stores. In addition, there was expansion into the new federal states and other European countries in the 1990s. After Metro AG's withdrawal as shareholder in 2006, the company experienced an existential crisis and posted high losses for years. Despite intensive efforts and considerable financial injections, the attempts to [[Restructuring|restructure]] failed.\n\nOn July 10, 2013 Praktiker AG filed for [[insolvency]] at the Hamburg district court the following day for the eight domestic subsidiaries, including Extra Bau+Hobby.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/praktiker-diy-stores-to-file-for-insolvency/a-16944612|title=Praktiker DIY stores to file for insolvency|author=DW.com|date=2013-07-11}}</ref>  The insolvency application for Praktiker AG was filed on July 12, 2013 at the Saarbr\u00fccken District Court and on 25 July 2013 for the Max Bahr subsidiary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/25/praktiker-insolvency-idUSWEB008RH20130725|title=Praktiker says Max Bahr units to file for insolvency|author=Reuters.com|date=2013-07-25]</ref> The Praktiker and Extra stores were closed on 30 November 2013, followed by the Max Bahr stores on February 25, 2014.\n\nExternal subsidiares were not affected by the [[bankruptcy]]. All of them was sold to other companies between 2013 and 2015. The name Praktiker continues to be used by former subsidiaries in Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary and Turkey.\n\nIn 2016 two German businessmen acquired the naming rights and opened under praktiker.de a home improvement [[online store]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.internetworld.de/e-commerce/online-handel/renaissance-im-internet-zweite-leben-praktiker-hertie-co-1143872.html|title=Renaissance im Internet: Das zweite Leben von Praktiker, Hertie und Co|author=internetworld.de|date=2016-10-30}}</ref>\n==Operations==\n\n===Germany===\nIn 1979 Praktiker opened its first four stores in Germany.

At the end of this process in December 2013 Germany should have 117 Praktiker and 196 Max Bahr outlets, at the beginning of that process there were 236 Praktiker and 78 Max Bahr stores. Because of the insolvency applications in July 2013 all those plans are stopped, with 54 former Praktiker stores already transferred to Max Bahr outlets. The companies Hellweg and Globus failed to reach an agreement with the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] to buy 59 Max Bahr stores in November 2013.

It was based in [[Hamburg]] and opened its first store in 1978 in [[Luxembourg]] under the name b\u00e2tiself. Initially owned by ASKO, the chain became a division of [[Metro AG]] after the merger of ASKO with Metro Cash & Carry in 1995. It was spun off under the name Praktiker Holding in November 2005 and listed on the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archiv.metrogroup.de/en/legal-announcements/2005/10/27/metro-ag-prepares-for-praktikers-ipo |title=METRO AG prepares for Praktiker's IPO |publisher=Metro AG |date=27 October 2005}}</ref> Since 2006 until 2011 was listed on [[MDAX]] and since 2011 until 2013 on [[SDAX]].\n\nIn contrast to most of its German competitors, the company grew up by buying up various small DIY chains and building material stores. In addition, there was expansion into the new federal states and other European countries in the 1990s. After Metro AG's withdrawal as shareholder in 2006, the company experienced an existential crisis and posted high losses for years. Despite intensive efforts and considerable financial injections, the attempts to [[Restructuring|restructure]] failed.\n\nOn July 10, 2013 Praktiker AG filed for [[insolvency]] at the Hamburg district court the following day for the eight domestic subsidiaries, including Extra Bau+Hobby.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/praktiker-diy-stores-to-file-for-insolvency/a-16944612|title=Praktiker DIY stores to file for insolvency|author=DW.com|date=2013-07-11}}</ref>  The insolvency application for Praktiker AG was filed on July 12, 2013 at the Saarbr\u00fccken District Court and on 25 July 2013 for the Max Bahr subsidiary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/25/praktiker-insolvency-idUSWEB008RH20130725|title=Praktiker says Max Bahr units to file for insolvency|author=Reuters.com|date=2013-07-25]</ref> The Praktiker and Extra stores were closed on 30 November 2013, followed by the Max Bahr stores on February 25, 2014.\n\nExternal subsidiares were not affected by the [[bankruptcy]]. All of them was sold to other companies between 2013 and 2015. The name Praktiker continues to be used by former subsidiaries in Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary and Turkey.\n\nIn 2016 two German businessmen acquired the naming rights and opened under praktiker.de a home improvement [[online store]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.internetworld.de/e-commerce/online-handel/renaissance-im-internet-zweite-leben-praktiker-hertie-co-1143872.html|title=Renaissance im Internet: Das zweite Leben von Praktiker, Hertie und Co|author=internetworld.de|date=2016-10-30}}</ref>\n==Operations==\n\n===Germany===\nIn 1979 Praktiker opened its first four stores in Germany.

At the end of this process in December 2013 Germany should have 117 Praktiker and 196 Max Bahr outlets, at the beginning of that process there were 236 Praktiker and 78 Max Bahr stores. Because of the insolvency applications in July 2013 all those plans are stopped, with 54 former Praktiker stores already transferred to Max Bahr outlets. The companies Hellweg and Globus failed to reach an agreement with the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] to buy 59 Max Bahr stores in November 2013.

Ella's close friendships with some of the other tenants, David and Jonah, are highlighted with some sexuality. Ambitious, scheming, and at times devious, Ella eventually comes into her own as a confident woman in show business. This is shown by her willingness to use her sexuality to get things done by seducing both men and women. Prior to Sydney's untimely death, Ella's relationship with her mentor had soured. She had a brief relationship with Jonah, after his broken engagement to Riley.\n* '''Jonah Miller''' ([[Michael Rady]]) is a good-natured friend of Ella's who works in the IT department of her agency and is also an aspiring filmmaker. His close friendship with Ella is only one of the problems in his relationship with his fianc\u00e9e, Riley.\n* '''Riley Richmond''' ([[Jessica Lucas]]) is an elementary schoolteacher who is engaged to Jonah. In addition to her being wary of Jonah's friendship with Ella, she also has some feelings for her jogging partner, Auggie.\n* '''August \"Auggie\" Kirkpatrick''' ([[Colin Egglesfield]]) is a chef and part-time surfer with a history of alcoholism, which has adversely affected his life to the point that it once got him in a fight which killed his girlfriend. This landed him in an [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meeting with [[Sydney Andrews]], with whom he had a brief relationship. With Sydney's help, he is able to overcome this. He later tries to help Sydney when she also becomes addicted to drugs. After Sydney's death, Auggie turns to Riley for comfort. When this does not work out, he begins a relationship with Violet (originally unaware that she is Sydney's long-lost daughter) and eventually leaves California with her.\n* '''Violet Foster''' ([[Ashlee Simpson|Ashlee Simpson-Wentz]]) is a young woman new to California and struggling to fit in with the other tenants of Melrose Place. While she quickly becomes friends with some of them, none of them know that she came to California to find her biological mother. It turned out that her biological mother is [[Sydney Andrews]], who rejected her at first but later wanted to get to know her. Violet's reunion with her mother is cut short when Sydney is found murdered in the pool. She later finds out about her mother's turbulent relationship with [[Michael Mancini|Dr. Michael Mancini]], whom she approaches to apply as the nanny of his son, Noah. Being just as scheming and manipulative as her biological mother, Violet eventually has an affair with Michael and even blackmails him with a recording of their one night stand. She reveals to him that she is Sydney's daughter and that she wants to get back at him for treating her mother badly. In searching for her mother's murderer, Violet finds out that Michael's wife, Vanessa, had previously confronted Sydney about her affair with Michael. Sydney's insinuation that Vanessa's son with Michael, Noah, was actually fathered by Michael's estranged son, David (who also had a brief relationship with Sydney), drove Vanessa to kill her. Violet then confronts Vanessa, resulting in a fight in the pool, and ultimately, Vanessa's death. Her drug-addicted adoptive brother came to California, and it was revealed they'd been secretly sleeping together unbeknownst to their parents. She then dated Auggie Kirkpatrick, eventually leaving California with him.\n* '''David Breck''' ([[Shaun Sipos]]), another friend of Ella's, is Michael Mancini's son with an unnamed woman. He had a brief relationship with his landlady, Sydney Andrews, prior to her untimely death. He is also, possibly, the biological father of Noah, the son of his father's recently deceased wife, Vanessa. David later has an intimate relationship with Ella's roommate, Lauren. Although they eventually ended breaking up, they both remain with strong feelings for each other. Often unemployed, David supports himself by performing robberies of houses in wealthy neighborhoods and selling the items he steals on the black market thanks to his criminal contact Amir. He later uses his ill-gotten money to buy the restaurant Coal as a means of going legal and legitimate.\n* '''Lauren Yung''' ([[Stephanie Jacobsen]]), Ella's roommate, is a cash-strapped medical student of Dr. Mancini. With the obsession to be a medical doctor at any cost, she reluctantly turns to prostitution in order to pay her tuition. Lauren's first client was a man who offered her a huge sum of money to have sex with him. He later becomes her \"pimp\", recommending her to one of his friends. After she rendered her services to a man she met at a certain hotel bar, she is confronted by Wendi, a madam who has made a deal with the hotel, who threatens her if she ever sees her there again. Lauren is eventually employed by Wendi, and her new job has become invasive of her personal life, to the point that her friends see less and less of her. When Michael Mancini threatens to reveal her secret to the hospital, she comes clean to her friends about her profession which she quits soon after and enters into a romance with David.\n\n===Recurring characters===\n* [[Jane Mancini|Jane Andrews]] ([[Josie Bissett]]) \u2014 2009\u20132010, Special Guest Star, from original series\n* [[Michael Mancini|Dr. Michael Mancini]] ([[Thomas Calabro]]) \u2014 2009\u20132010, Special Guest Star, from original series\n* [[Sydney Andrews]] ([[Laura Leighton]]) \u2014 2009,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.spoilersguide.com/melrose-place/episode-18-official-synopsis-3/| title=Melrose Place Episode 18 \"Wilshire\": Official Synopsis| work=Spoilers Guide| accessdate=February 23, 2013}}</ref> Special Guest Star, from original series\n* [[Amanda Woodward (Melrose Place)|Amanda Woodward]] ([[Heather Locklear]]) \u2014 2009\u20132010, Special Guest Star, from original series\n* [[Jo Reynolds]] ([[Daphne Zuniga]]) \u2014 2009\u20132010, Special Guest Star, from original series\n* Vanessa Mancini ([[Brooke Burns]]) \u2014 2009\u20132010; Michael's newest wife.

The building's owner, Sydney Andrews, is a central figure in the lives of all her tenants, especially handsome and rebellious David Breck. Sydney started an affair with David despite her turbulent history with his estranged father, Dr. Michael Mancini. Both father and son learned through experience that Sydney was not above using blackmail to control people. Another tenant, upcoming publicist Ella Simms, once considered Sydney her mentor, but their friendship was destroyed by betrayal, and Sydney threatened to evict Ella and ruin her career. Sydney also played a pivotal role in the career of Auggie Kirkpatrick. After they met at an AA meeting, she became Auggie's sponsor and encouraged him to become a chef. Now a successful ''sous'' chef at the trendy restaurant Coal, Auggie has been avoiding Sydney since she began drinking again. Other tenants include Lauren Yung, a medical student in desperate need of money to pay her student loans, and Jonah Miller, an aspiring filmmaker who has just proposed to his live-in girlfriend of five years, Riley Richmond, a first-grade teacher. The newest tenant, 21-year-old Oregon native Violet Foster, has just arrived in LA with her own secret connection to Sydney. When a bloody body is found floating in the courtyard pool, David is the leading suspect. However, as the police soon discover, almost everyone living at Melrose Place had a reason to want the deceased out of the way.\n |LineColor         = 04b186\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber     = 2\n |Title             = Nightingale\n |OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|2009|9|15}}\n |DirectedBy        = [[Greg Beeman]]\n |WrittenBy         = [[Liz Tigelaar]]\n |Viewers           = 1.81<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2009/09/16/tv-ratings-tuesday-the-jay-leno-showdrops-to-10-7-million-viewers/27314|title=Updated TV Ratings Tuesday: ''The Jay Leno Show'' declines, ''Big Brother'' exits, ''Melrose'' slips|last=Seidman|first=Robert|date=September 16, 2009|website=TV by the Numbers|accessdate=September 26, 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922214457/http://tvbythenumbers.com/2009/09/16/tv-ratings-tuesday-the-jay-leno-showdrops-to-10-7-million-viewers/27314|archivedate=September 22, 2009|df=}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary      = Still freaked out by the recent murder, the Melrose Place tenants try to resume some sense of a normal life.

Drew tries to stop Michael from performing a dangerous heart surgery, but Michael sets him up to get caught with drugs, causing the former to be thrown in jail, and out of ULA. Aware that Drew was set up, Lauren risks her job when she stops Dr. Mancini from performing another M-valve heart surgery by announcing his secret in front of his surgical team. Michael is then suspended from the hospital pending a medical board and police investigation, yet he defiantly vows to destroy both Lauren's life and career for ratting him out. Lauren and David reconcile, but a jealous Morgan finds out and seeks revenge by having her equally evil mobster father blackmail David into performing robberies for him and also forces David not to tell anyone, not even Lauren, about their secret agreement or she will be physically harmed. Meanwhile, Jonah asks Riley to reconcile after they attend an NYU reunion program, but she declines and decides to look forward towards a future with Drew. Eventually, Drew reveals to Riley that he had a heart surgery five years earlier and had one of Michael's faulty heart valves put in due to a genetic heart problem, meaning he may die anytime. Amanda is haunted by Sydney's illusion over the Ella situation. Eventually, Amanda accepts Ella's demands for a large severance pay, a WPK letter of recommendation, as well as erasing the false evidence of Ella's embezzlement. Ella then gives Amanda the stolen painting, who then sells it on the black market and makes $2 million in cash. The next day, when Ella shows up at WPK to collect, Amanda (not surprisingly) goes back on her word when she refuses to give Ella her severance pay and naturally denies making any secret deal. Just then, two FBI agents arrive in Amanda's office and arrest her after Ella (predicting exactly that Amanda would not keep her promise) informed them of the fraud Amanda committed (over the stolen painting) as well as embezzlement of company funds and framing Ella, who also announces that the WPK board of directors have now appointed her as Amanda's replacement. The audience is left unsure of all of the characters' fates at this point. As Amanda is handcuffed and is taken away by the police to finally face justice for her vast list of crimes, she (angry, heartless and defiant to the end; similar to the equally unethical and heartless Michael Mancini's parting threat to Lauren) vows revenge against the unfazed Ella by uttering the final words of the show: \"You say you modeled your career after me, studied my every move?

Ella's close friendships with some of the other tenants, David and Jonah, are highlighted with some sexuality. Ambitious, scheming, and at times devious, Ella eventually comes into her own as a confident woman in show business. This is shown by her willingness to use her sexuality to get things done by seducing both men and women. Prior to Sydney's untimely death, Ella's relationship with her mentor had soured. She had a brief relationship with Jonah, after his broken engagement to Riley.\n* '''Jonah Miller''' ([[Michael Rady]]) is a good-natured friend of Ella's who works in the IT department of her agency and is also an aspiring filmmaker. His close friendship with Ella is only one of the problems in his relationship with his fianc\u00e9e, Riley.\n* '''Riley Richmond''' ([[Jessica Lucas]]) is an elementary schoolteacher who is engaged to Jonah. In addition to her being wary of Jonah's friendship with Ella, she also has some feelings for her jogging partner, Auggie.\n* '''August \"Auggie\" Kirkpatrick''' ([[Colin Egglesfield]]) is a chef and part-time surfer with a history of alcoholism, which has adversely affected his life to the point that it once got him in a fight which killed his girlfriend. This landed him in an [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meeting with [[Sydney Andrews]], with whom he had a brief relationship. With Sydney's help, he is able to overcome this. He later tries to help Sydney when she also becomes addicted to drugs. After Sydney's death, Auggie turns to Riley for comfort. When this does not work out, he begins a relationship with Violet (originally unaware that she is Sydney's long-lost daughter) and eventually leaves California with her.\n* '''Violet Foster''' ([[Ashlee Simpson|Ashlee Simpson-Wentz]]) is a young woman new to California and struggling to fit in with the other tenants of Melrose Place. While she quickly becomes friends with some of them, none of them know that she came to California to find her biological mother. It turned out that her biological mother is [[Sydney Andrews]], who rejected her at first but later wanted to get to know her. Violet's reunion with her mother is cut short when Sydney is found murdered in the pool. She later finds out about her mother's turbulent relationship with [[Michael Mancini|Dr. Michael Mancini]], whom she approaches to apply as the nanny of his son, Noah. Being just as scheming and manipulative as her biological mother, Violet eventually has an affair with Michael and even blackmails him with a recording of their one night stand. She reveals to him that she is Sydney's daughter and that she wants to get back at him for treating her mother badly. In searching for her mother's murderer, Violet finds out that Michael's wife, Vanessa, had previously confronted Sydney about her affair with Michael. Sydney's insinuation that Vanessa's son with Michael, Noah, was actually fathered by Michael's estranged son, David (who also had a brief relationship with Sydney), drove Vanessa to kill her. Violet then confronts Vanessa, resulting in a fight in the pool, and ultimately, Vanessa's death. Her drug-addicted adoptive brother came to California, and it was revealed they'd been secretly sleeping together unbeknownst to their parents. She then dated Auggie Kirkpatrick, eventually leaving California with him.\n* '''David Breck''' ([[Shaun Sipos]]), another friend of Ella's, is Michael Mancini's son with an unnamed woman. He had a brief relationship with his landlady, Sydney Andrews, prior to her untimely death. He is also, possibly, the biological father of Noah, the son of his father's recently deceased wife, Vanessa. David later has an intimate relationship with Ella's roommate, Lauren. Although they eventually ended breaking up, they both remain with strong feelings for each other. Often unemployed, David supports himself by performing robberies of houses in wealthy neighborhoods and selling the items he steals on the black market thanks to his criminal contact Amir. He later uses his ill-gotten money to buy the restaurant Coal as a means of going legal and legitimate.\n* '''Lauren Yung''' ([[Stephanie Jacobsen]]), Ella's roommate, is a cash-strapped medical student of Dr. Mancini. With the obsession to be a medical doctor at any cost, she reluctantly turns to prostitution in order to pay her tuition. Lauren's first client was a man who offered her a huge sum of money to have sex with him. He later becomes her \"pimp\", recommending her to one of his friends. After she rendered her services to a man she met at a certain hotel bar, she is confronted by Wendi, a madam who has made a deal with the hotel, who threatens her if she ever sees her there again. Lauren is eventually employed by Wendi, and her new job has become invasive of her personal life, to the point that her friends see less and less of her. When Michael Mancini threatens to reveal her secret to the hospital, she comes clean to her friends about her profession which she quits soon after and enters into a romance with David.\n\n===Recurring characters===\n* [[Jane Mancini|Jane Andrews]] ([[Josie Bissett]]) \u2014 2009\u20132010, Special Guest Star, from original series\n* [[Michael Mancini|Dr. Michael Mancini]] ([[Thomas Calabro]]) \u2014 2009\u20132010, Special Guest Star, from original series\n* [[Sydney Andrews]] ([[Laura Leighton]]) \u2014 2009,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.spoilersguide.com/melrose-place/episode-18-official-synopsis-3/| title=Melrose Place Episode 18 \"Wilshire\": Official Synopsis| work=Spoilers Guide| accessdate=February 23, 2013}}</ref> Special Guest Star, from original series\n* [[Amanda Woodward (Melrose Place)|Amanda Woodward]] ([[Heather Locklear]]) \u2014 2009\u20132010, Special Guest Star, from original series\n* [[Jo Reynolds]] ([[Daphne Zuniga]]) \u2014 2009\u20132010, Special Guest Star, from original series\n* Vanessa Mancini ([[Brooke Burns]]) \u2014 2009\u20132010; Michael's newest wife.

The building's owner, Sydney Andrews, is a central figure in the lives of all her tenants, especially handsome and rebellious David Breck. Sydney started an affair with David despite her turbulent history with his estranged father, Dr. Michael Mancini. Both father and son learned through experience that Sydney was not above using blackmail to control people. Another tenant, upcoming publicist Ella Simms, once considered Sydney her mentor, but their friendship was destroyed by betrayal, and Sydney threatened to evict Ella and ruin her career. Sydney also played a pivotal role in the career of Auggie Kirkpatrick. After they met at an AA meeting, she became Auggie's sponsor and encouraged him to become a chef. Now a successful ''sous'' chef at the trendy restaurant Coal, Auggie has been avoiding Sydney since she began drinking again. Other tenants include Lauren Yung, a medical student in desperate need of money to pay her student loans, and Jonah Miller, an aspiring filmmaker who has just proposed to his live-in girlfriend of five years, Riley Richmond, a first-grade teacher. The newest tenant, 21-year-old Oregon native Violet Foster, has just arrived in LA with her own secret connection to Sydney. When a bloody body is found floating in the courtyard pool, David is the leading suspect. However, as the police soon discover, almost everyone living at Melrose Place had a reason to want the deceased out of the way.\n |LineColor         = 04b186\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber     = 2\n |Title             = Nightingale\n |OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|2009|9|15}}\n |DirectedBy        = [[Greg Beeman]]\n |WrittenBy         = [[Liz Tigelaar]]\n |Viewers           = 1.81<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2009/09/16/tv-ratings-tuesday-the-jay-leno-showdrops-to-10-7-million-viewers/27314|title=Updated TV Ratings Tuesday: ''The Jay Leno Show'' declines, ''Big Brother'' exits, ''Melrose'' slips|last=Seidman|first=Robert|date=September 16, 2009|website=TV by the Numbers|accessdate=September 26, 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922214457/http://tvbythenumbers.com/2009/09/16/tv-ratings-tuesday-the-jay-leno-showdrops-to-10-7-million-viewers/27314|archivedate=September 22, 2009|df=}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary      = Still freaked out by the recent murder, the Melrose Place tenants try to resume some sense of a normal life.

Drew tries to stop Michael from performing a dangerous heart surgery, but Michael sets him up to get caught with drugs, causing the former to be thrown in jail, and out of ULA. Aware that Drew was set up, Lauren risks her job when she stops Dr. Mancini from performing another M-valve heart surgery by announcing his secret in front of his surgical team. Michael is then suspended from the hospital pending a medical board and police investigation, yet he defiantly vows to destroy both Lauren's life and career for ratting him out. Lauren and David reconcile, but a jealous Morgan finds out and seeks revenge by having her equally evil mobster father blackmail David into performing robberies for him and also forces David not to tell anyone, not even Lauren, about their secret agreement or she will be physically harmed. Meanwhile, Jonah asks Riley to reconcile after they attend an NYU reunion program, but she declines and decides to look forward towards a future with Drew. Eventually, Drew reveals to Riley that he had a heart surgery five years earlier and had one of Michael's faulty heart valves put in due to a genetic heart problem, meaning he may die anytime. Amanda is haunted by Sydney's illusion over the Ella situation. Eventually, Amanda accepts Ella's demands for a large severance pay, a WPK letter of recommendation, as well as erasing the false evidence of Ella's embezzlement. Ella then gives Amanda the stolen painting, who then sells it on the black market and makes $2 million in cash. The next day, when Ella shows up at WPK to collect, Amanda (not surprisingly) goes back on her word when she refuses to give Ella her severance pay and naturally denies making any secret deal. Just then, two FBI agents arrive in Amanda's office and arrest her after Ella (predicting exactly that Amanda would not keep her promise) informed them of the fraud Amanda committed (over the stolen painting) as well as embezzlement of company funds and framing Ella, who also announces that the WPK board of directors have now appointed her as Amanda's replacement. The audience is left unsure of all of the characters' fates at this point. As Amanda is handcuffed and is taken away by the police to finally face justice for her vast list of crimes, she (angry, heartless and defiant to the end; similar to the equally unethical and heartless Michael Mancini's parting threat to Lauren) vows revenge against the unfazed Ella by uttering the final words of the show: \"You say you modeled your career after me, studied my every move?

By contrast, the late 1910s/early 1920s, the 1930s, the 1970s and early 1990s were marked by financial crises.\n\n====Economic liberalisation====\nFrom the early 1980s onwards, the Australian economy has undergone intermittent [[Economic liberalization|economic liberalisation]]. In 1983, under prime minister [[Bob Hawke]], but mainly driven by treasurer [[Paul Keating]], the Australian dollar was floated and financial [[deregulation]] was undertaken.\n\n====Early 1990s recession====\n{{Main|Early 1990s recession}}\nThe early 1990s recession came swiftly after the [[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday of October 1987]], as a result of a stock collapse of unprecedented size which caused the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] to fall by 22.6%. This collapse, larger than the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|stock market crash of 1929]], was handled effectively by the global economy and the stock market began to quickly recover. But in North America, the lumbering [[Savings and loan association|savings and loans]] industry was facing decline, which eventually led to a [[savings and loan crisis]] which compromised the well-being of millions of US people. The following recession thus impacted the many countries closely linked to the US, including Australia. Paul Keating, who was [[Treasurer of Australia|treasurer]] at the time, famously referred to it as \"the recession that Australia had to have.\"<ref>[http://www.australianpolitics.com/executive/keating/keating-chronology.shtml Paul Keating \u2013 Chronology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926220100/http://www.australianpolitics.com/executive/keating/keating-chronology.shtml |date=26 September 2011 }} at australianpolitics.com</ref> During the recession, GDP fell by 1.7%, employment by 3.4% and the unemployment rate rose to 10.8%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/the-real-reasons-why-it-was-the-1990s-recession-we-had-to-have/2006/12/01/1164777791623.html?page=3|title=The real reasons why it was the 1990s recession we had to have|work=[[The Age (newspaper)|The Age]]|date=2 December 2006|accessdate=8 January 2014}}</ref> However, the recession did assist in reducing long-term inflation rate expectations and Australia has maintained a low inflation environment since the 1990s to the present day.\n\n===Mining===\n{{Main|Mining in Australia}}\nMining has contributed to Australia's high level of economic growth, from the [[Australian gold rushes|gold rush]] in the 1840s to the present day. The opportunities for large profits in pastoralism and mining attracted considerable amounts of British capital, while expansion was supported by enormous government outlays for transport, communication, and urban infrastructures, which also depended heavily on British finance. As the economy expanded, large-scale immigration satisfied the growing demand for workers, especially after the end of convict transportation to the eastern mainland in 1840. Australia's mining operations secured continued economic growth and Western Australia itself benefited strongly from mining iron ore and gold from the 1960s and 1970s which fueled the rise of suburbanisation and consumerism in [[Perth]], the capital and most populous city of Western Australia, as well as other regional centres.\n\n===Global financial crisis===\n{{Main|2007\u20132012 global financial crisis}}\n{{further|Rudd Government (2007\u201310)}}\nThe Australian government stimulus package ($11.8&nbsp;billion) helped to prevent a recession.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Junankar|first1=P.|title=Australia: The Miracle Economy|journal=IZA Discussion Papers 7505, Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA)|year=2013}}</ref>\n\nThe [[World Bank]] expected Australia's GDP growth rate to be 3.2% in 2011 and 3.8% in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.crikey.com.au/thestump/2011/01/13/world-bank-expects-australian-gdp-growth-of-3-2-in-2011-and-3-8-in-2012/ |title=World Bank expects Australian GDP growth of 3.2% in 2011 and 3.8% in 2012 &#124;

The mining sector's contribution to overall GDP grew from around 4.5% in 1993\u201394, to almost 8% in 2006\u201307. The services sector also grew considerably, with property and business services in particular growing from 10% to 14.5% of GDP over the same period, making it the largest single component of GDP (in sectoral terms). This growth has largely been at the expense of the manufacturing sector, which in 2006\u201307 accounted for around 12% of GDP. A decade earlier, it was the largest sector in the economy, accounting for just over 15% of GDP.<ref name=\"abs.gov.au\">{{cite web |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/5204.0Main%20Features502006-07?opendocument&tabname=Summary&prodno=5204.0&issue=2006-07&num=&view= |title=Summary |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907050320/http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs%40.nsf/Latestproducts/5204.0Main%20Features502006-07?opendocument&tabname=Summary&prodno=5204.0&issue=2006-07&num=&view= |archivedate=7 September 2008  }}</ref>\n\n===Regional differences===\nBetween 2010 and 2013, much of the economic growth in Australia was attributed to areas of the country where mining- and resource-based industries and services are mostly located.

The federal government raises revenue from [[Income tax in Australia|personal income taxes]] and business taxes. Other taxes include the [[Goods and services tax (Australia)|goods and services tax (General Service Tax)]], excise and customs duties. The federal government is the main source of income for state governments. As a result of state dependence on federal taxation revenue to meet decentralised expenditure responsibilities, Australia is said to have a vertical [[fiscal imbalance]].\n\nBesides receipts of funds from the federal government, states and territories have their own taxes, in many cases as slightly different rates. State taxes commonly include [[payroll tax]] levied on businesses, a poker-machine tax on businesses that offer gambling services, [[Land value tax|land tax]] on people and businesses that own land and most significantly, [[stamp duty]] on sales of land (in every state) and other items (chattels in some states, unlisted shares in others, and even sales of contracts in some states).\n\nThe states effectively lost the ability to raise income tax during the Second World War. In 1942, Canberra invoked its Constitutional taxation power (s. 51 (ii)) and enacted the ''Income Tax Act'' and three other statutes to levy a uniform income tax across the country. These acts sought to raise the funds necessary to meet burgeoning wartime expenses and reduce the unequal tax burden between the states by replacing state income taxes with a centralised tax system. The legislation could not expressly prohibit state income taxes (s. 51(ii) does not curtail the power of states to levy taxes) but the federal government's proposal made localised income tax extremely difficult politically. The federal government offered instead compensatory grants authorised by s. 96 of the Constitution for the loss of state income (''State Grants (Income Tax Reimbursement) Act 1942'').\n\nThe states rejected Canberra's regime and challenged the legislation's validity in the First Uniform Tax Case (''[[South Australia v Commonwealth]]'') of 1942. The High Court of Australia held that each of the statutes establishing Commonwealth income tax was a valid use of the s. 51(ii) power, in which Latham CJ noted that the system did not undermine essential state functions and imposed only economic and political pressure upon them.\n\nThe Second Uniform Tax Case (''Victoria v Commonwealth'' (1957)) reaffirmed the court's earlier decision and confirmed the power of the federal government's power to make s. 96 grants conditionally (in this case, a grant made on the condition that the recipient state does not levy income tax).\n\nSince the [[Victoria v Commonwealth (1957)|Second Uniform Tax Case]], a number of other political and legal decisions have centralised fiscal power with the Commonwealth. In ''Ha vs. New South Wales'' (1997), the High Court found that the ''Business Franchise Licences (Tobacco) Act 1987'' (NSW) was invalid because it levied a customs duty, a power exercisable only by the Commonwealth (s.90). This decision effectively invalidated state taxes on cigarettes, alcohol and petrol. Similarly, the imposition of a Commonwealth goods and services tax (GST) in 2000 transferred another revenue base to the Commonwealth.\n\nConsequently, Australia has one of the most pronounced vertical fiscal imbalances in the world: the states and territories collect just 18% of all governmental revenues but are responsible for almost 50% of the spending areas. Furthermore, the centralisation of revenue collection has allowed Canberra to force state policy in areas well beyond the scope of its constitutional powers, by using the grants power (s.96) to mandate the terms on which the states spend money in areas over which it has no power (such as spending on education, health and policing).\n\nLocal governments (called ''councils'' in Australia) have their own taxes (called rates) to enable them to provide services such as local road repairs, local planning and building management, garbage collection, street cleaning, park maintenance services, libraries, and museums. Councils also rely on state and federal funding to provide infrastructure and services such as roads, bridges, sporting facilities and buildings, aged care, maternal and child health, and childcare.\n\nIn 2000, a [[Goods and services tax (Australia)|goods and services tax]] (GST) was introduced, similar to the European-style [[Value-added tax|VAT]].\n\n==Employment==\n[[File:ABS-6202.0-LabourForceAustralia-LabourForceStatusBySex SeasonallyAdjusted-UnemploymentRate-Persons-A181525X.svg|thumb|right|The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate since 1978]]\n[[File:ABS-6354.0-JobVacanciesAustralia-JobVacanciesStatesTerritories-JobVacancies-Australia-A590696A.svg|thumb|right|The number of job vacancies (thousands) since 1979]]\nAccording to the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] (ABS) [[Seasonal adjustment|seasonally adjusted]] estimates, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 points to 5.2% in March 2020 while the [[Unemployment|labor force participation rate]] remained steady at 66.0%.

Historically, Australia has relied on overseas capital to fill the gap between domestic savings and investment, and many of these investment opportunities could not have been pursued if Australia did not have access to foreign savings. This suggests that Australia's apparently low savings level and CAD are not necessarily a significant problem. As long as the investment that is being funded by overseas capital inflow generates sufficient returns to pay for the servicing costs in the future, the increase in foreign liabilities can be viewed as sustainable in the longer term.<ref>Tim Dixon & James O'Mahoney, Australia in the Global Economy 2010, Leading Edge Education, Pearson Australia</ref>\n\n===Personal wealth===\n[[File:Australia's GNI per capita in 2015.png|thumb|GNI per capita in 2015]]\nAccording to the 2011 [[Credit Suisse]] Global Wealth report, Australia's wealth per adult had quadrupled over the past decade, and its total wealth was US$6.4&nbsp;trillion.

By contrast, the late 1910s/early 1920s, the 1930s, the 1970s and early 1990s were marked by financial crises.\n\n====Economic liberalisation====\nFrom the early 1980s onwards, the Australian economy has undergone intermittent [[Economic liberalization|economic liberalisation]]. In 1983, under prime minister [[Bob Hawke]], but mainly driven by treasurer [[Paul Keating]], the Australian dollar was floated and financial [[deregulation]] was undertaken.\n\n====Early 1990s recession====\n{{Main|Early 1990s recession}}\nThe early 1990s recession came swiftly after the [[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday of October 1987]], as a result of a stock collapse of unprecedented size which caused the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] to fall by 22.6%. This collapse, larger than the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|stock market crash of 1929]], was handled effectively by the global economy and the stock market began to quickly recover. But in North America, the lumbering [[Savings and loan association|savings and loans]] industry was facing decline, which eventually led to a [[savings and loan crisis]] which compromised the well-being of millions of US people. The following recession thus impacted the many countries closely linked to the US, including Australia. Paul Keating, who was [[Treasurer of Australia|treasurer]] at the time, famously referred to it as \"the recession that Australia had to have.\"<ref>[http://www.australianpolitics.com/executive/keating/keating-chronology.shtml Paul Keating \u2013 Chronology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926220100/http://www.australianpolitics.com/executive/keating/keating-chronology.shtml |date=26 September 2011 }} at australianpolitics.com</ref> During the recession, GDP fell by 1.7%, employment by 3.4% and the unemployment rate rose to 10.8%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/the-real-reasons-why-it-was-the-1990s-recession-we-had-to-have/2006/12/01/1164777791623.html?page=3|title=The real reasons why it was the 1990s recession we had to have|work=[[The Age (newspaper)|The Age]]|date=2 December 2006|accessdate=8 January 2014}}</ref> However, the recession did assist in reducing long-term inflation rate expectations and Australia has maintained a low inflation environment since the 1990s to the present day.\n\n===Mining===\n{{Main|Mining in Australia}}\nMining has contributed to Australia's high level of economic growth, from the [[Australian gold rushes|gold rush]] in the 1840s to the present day. The opportunities for large profits in pastoralism and mining attracted considerable amounts of British capital, while expansion was supported by enormous government outlays for transport, communication, and urban infrastructures, which also depended heavily on British finance. As the economy expanded, large-scale immigration satisfied the growing demand for workers, especially after the end of convict transportation to the eastern mainland in 1840. Australia's mining operations secured continued economic growth and Western Australia itself benefited strongly from mining iron ore and gold from the 1960s and 1970s which fueled the rise of suburbanisation and consumerism in [[Perth]], the capital and most populous city of Western Australia, as well as other regional centres.\n\n===Global financial crisis===\n{{Main|2007\u20132012 global financial crisis}}\n{{further|Rudd Government (2007\u201310)}}\nThe Australian government stimulus package ($11.8&nbsp;billion) helped to prevent a recession.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Junankar|first1=P.|title=Australia: The Miracle Economy|journal=IZA Discussion Papers 7505, Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA)|year=2013}}</ref>\n\nThe [[World Bank]] expected Australia's GDP growth rate to be 3.2% in 2011 and 3.8% in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.crikey.com.au/thestump/2011/01/13/world-bank-expects-australian-gdp-growth-of-3-2-in-2011-and-3-8-in-2012/ |title=World Bank expects Australian GDP growth of 3.2% in 2011 and 3.8% in 2012 &#124;

The mining sector's contribution to overall GDP grew from around 4.5% in 1993\u201394, to almost 8% in 2006\u201307. The services sector also grew considerably, with property and business services in particular growing from 10% to 14.5% of GDP over the same period, making it the largest single component of GDP (in sectoral terms). This growth has largely been at the expense of the manufacturing sector, which in 2006\u201307 accounted for around 12% of GDP. A decade earlier, it was the largest sector in the economy, accounting for just over 15% of GDP.<ref name=\"abs.gov.au\">{{cite web |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/5204.0Main%20Features502006-07?opendocument&tabname=Summary&prodno=5204.0&issue=2006-07&num=&view= |title=Summary |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907050320/http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs%40.nsf/Latestproducts/5204.0Main%20Features502006-07?opendocument&tabname=Summary&prodno=5204.0&issue=2006-07&num=&view= |archivedate=7 September 2008  }}</ref>\n\n===Regional differences===\nBetween 2010 and 2013, much of the economic growth in Australia was attributed to areas of the country where mining- and resource-based industries and services are mostly located.

The federal government raises revenue from [[Income tax in Australia|personal income taxes]] and business taxes. Other taxes include the [[Goods and services tax (Australia)|goods and services tax (General Service Tax)]], excise and customs duties. The federal government is the main source of income for state governments. As a result of state dependence on federal taxation revenue to meet decentralised expenditure responsibilities, Australia is said to have a vertical [[fiscal imbalance]].\n\nBesides receipts of funds from the federal government, states and territories have their own taxes, in many cases as slightly different rates. State taxes commonly include [[payroll tax]] levied on businesses, a poker-machine tax on businesses that offer gambling services, [[Land value tax|land tax]] on people and businesses that own land and most significantly, [[stamp duty]] on sales of land (in every state) and other items (chattels in some states, unlisted shares in others, and even sales of contracts in some states).\n\nThe states effectively lost the ability to raise income tax during the Second World War. In 1942, Canberra invoked its Constitutional taxation power (s. 51 (ii)) and enacted the ''Income Tax Act'' and three other statutes to levy a uniform income tax across the country. These acts sought to raise the funds necessary to meet burgeoning wartime expenses and reduce the unequal tax burden between the states by replacing state income taxes with a centralised tax system. The legislation could not expressly prohibit state income taxes (s. 51(ii) does not curtail the power of states to levy taxes) but the federal government's proposal made localised income tax extremely difficult politically. The federal government offered instead compensatory grants authorised by s. 96 of the Constitution for the loss of state income (''State Grants (Income Tax Reimbursement) Act 1942'').\n\nThe states rejected Canberra's regime and challenged the legislation's validity in the First Uniform Tax Case (''[[South Australia v Commonwealth]]'') of 1942. The High Court of Australia held that each of the statutes establishing Commonwealth income tax was a valid use of the s. 51(ii) power, in which Latham CJ noted that the system did not undermine essential state functions and imposed only economic and political pressure upon them.\n\nThe Second Uniform Tax Case (''Victoria v Commonwealth'' (1957)) reaffirmed the court's earlier decision and confirmed the power of the federal government's power to make s. 96 grants conditionally (in this case, a grant made on the condition that the recipient state does not levy income tax).\n\nSince the [[Victoria v Commonwealth (1957)|Second Uniform Tax Case]], a number of other political and legal decisions have centralised fiscal power with the Commonwealth. In ''Ha vs. New South Wales'' (1997), the High Court found that the ''Business Franchise Licences (Tobacco) Act 1987'' (NSW) was invalid because it levied a customs duty, a power exercisable only by the Commonwealth (s.90). This decision effectively invalidated state taxes on cigarettes, alcohol and petrol. Similarly, the imposition of a Commonwealth goods and services tax (GST) in 2000 transferred another revenue base to the Commonwealth.\n\nConsequently, Australia has one of the most pronounced vertical fiscal imbalances in the world: the states and territories collect just 18% of all governmental revenues but are responsible for almost 50% of the spending areas. Furthermore, the centralisation of revenue collection has allowed Canberra to force state policy in areas well beyond the scope of its constitutional powers, by using the grants power (s.96) to mandate the terms on which the states spend money in areas over which it has no power (such as spending on education, health and policing).\n\nLocal governments (called ''councils'' in Australia) have their own taxes (called rates) to enable them to provide services such as local road repairs, local planning and building management, garbage collection, street cleaning, park maintenance services, libraries, and museums. Councils also rely on state and federal funding to provide infrastructure and services such as roads, bridges, sporting facilities and buildings, aged care, maternal and child health, and childcare.\n\nIn 2000, a [[Goods and services tax (Australia)|goods and services tax]] (GST) was introduced, similar to the European-style [[Value-added tax|VAT]].\n\n==Employment==\n[[File:ABS-6202.0-LabourForceAustralia-LabourForceStatusBySex SeasonallyAdjusted-UnemploymentRate-Persons-A181525X.svg|thumb|right|The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate since 1978]]\n[[File:ABS-6354.0-JobVacanciesAustralia-JobVacanciesStatesTerritories-JobVacancies-Australia-A590696A.svg|thumb|right|The number of job vacancies (thousands) since 1979]]\nAccording to the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] (ABS) [[Seasonal adjustment|seasonally adjusted]] estimates, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 points to 5.2% in March 2020 while the [[Unemployment|labor force participation rate]] remained steady at 66.0%.

Historically, Australia has relied on overseas capital to fill the gap between domestic savings and investment, and many of these investment opportunities could not have been pursued if Australia did not have access to foreign savings. This suggests that Australia's apparently low savings level and CAD are not necessarily a significant problem. As long as the investment that is being funded by overseas capital inflow generates sufficient returns to pay for the servicing costs in the future, the increase in foreign liabilities can be viewed as sustainable in the longer term.<ref>Tim Dixon & James O'Mahoney, Australia in the Global Economy 2010, Leading Edge Education, Pearson Australia</ref>\n\n===Personal wealth===\n[[File:Australia's GNI per capita in 2015.png|thumb|GNI per capita in 2015]]\nAccording to the 2011 [[Credit Suisse]] Global Wealth report, Australia's wealth per adult had quadrupled over the past decade, and its total wealth was US$6.4&nbsp;trillion.
