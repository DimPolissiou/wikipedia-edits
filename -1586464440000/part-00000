He continues to record and tour as a solo artist, and as guitarist with [[Paul Rodgers|The Paul Rodgers Band]] and [[Bad Company]].  He is currently performing in the Las Vegas production of ''[[Raiding the Rock Vault]]''. In 2013, he was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a member of Heart. \n\n==Career==\nHoward received his inspiration to pick up the guitar during the 1960s after seeing [[Dick Dale]], the guitarist in the surf band \"the Del-Tones\", and feeling the excitement from his playing. He studied violin and music theory at the [[Los Angeles City College|City College, Los Angeles]], and also played in a band called The Zoo.\n\nLeese had his first recording contract with [[Ed Cobb]]'s Sunburst label<ref>Not Sunburst Records of Huntsville, Alabama, but a Los Angeles based company.</ref> at the age of 15, as the band ''The Zoo'' with friend and drummer [[Mike Flicker]].  Later, when Flicker went to work for Jack Herschorn at [[Mushroom Studios]] in [[Vancouver]], Leese went with him as a production manager.  While there, he and Shelly Siegel started [[Mushroom Records (Canada)|Mushroom Records]].\n\nIt was at Mushroom Studios in 1974 that Leese helped produce a demo for [[Heart (band)|Heart]].  The next year, Mushroom Records signed Heart and released the group's first album ''[[Dreamboat Annie]]'' which Flicker produced.  Leese was assistant producer on the album, and was asked to join the band later that year. He played with the band until 1998, when the Wilson sisters put the band on hiatus for several years to pursue other projects and devote more time to their personal lives. Leese was Heart's guitarist, backing vocalist, keyboard player (best known for playing the Mini-Moog solo on the hit song \"Magic Man\") and song arranger. Aside from the Wilson sisters, Leese is the longest serving member of Heart.

They were an important element in many famous [[World War II|Second World War]] battles, notably the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Battle of Taranto|attack at Taranto]], the sinking of the German battleship [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']], and the [[Japan]]ese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].\n\n==Types==\n[[File:The Royal Navy during the Second World War A20170.jpg|left|thumb|A formation of [[Fairey Barracuda]] during [[WW2]] ]]\n\nTorpedo bombers first appeared immediately prior to the First World War. Generally, they carried [[torpedo]]es specifically designed for air launch, which were smaller and lighter than those used by [[submarine]]s and surface warships. Nonetheless, as an airborne torpedo could weigh as much as {{convert|2000|lb|kg}}, more than twice the bomb load of contemporary single-engined bombers, the aircraft carrying it usually needed to be specially designed for the purpose. Many early torpedo bombers were [[floatplane]]s, such as the [[Short 184]] (the first aircraft to sink a ship with a torpedo), and the undercarriage had to be redesigned so that the torpedo could be dropped from the aircraft's centerline.\n\nWhile many torpedo bombers were single-engine aircraft, some multi-engined aircraft have also been used as torpedo bombers, with the [[Mitsubishi G3M]] ''Nell'' and [[Mitsubishi G4M]] ''Betty'' being used in the [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|sinking of ''Prince of Wales'' and ''Repulse'']]. Other twin-engine or three-engined aircraft designed or used as torpedo bombers include the [[Mitsubishi Ki-67]], the [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.79]] \"Sparviero\", the [[CANT Z.1007]], the [[Bristol Beaufort]] and [[Bristol Beaufighter]] (\"Torbeau\"), the [[Junkers Ju 88]], the [[Heinkel He 111]], the [[B-25 Mitchell]] and many others.\n\nSome postwar jet aircraft (such as the [[Ilyushin Il-28]]T) were adapted as torpedo bombers in the late 1940s and 1950s. The last known torpedo bomber attack was made by US Navy [[Douglas A-1 Skyraider|Skyraiders]] against the [[Hwacheon Dam]] during the [[Korean War]]. The [[North Korean Air Force]] finally retired the world's last operational torpedo bombers in the 1980s.\n\nIn a parallel development, many maritime strike aircraft and helicopters have been capable of launching guided torpedoes; however, they are not generally referred to as torpedo bombers because of their vastly greater detection and tracking capabilities, although they remain just as capable of making attacks on surface ships as against submarines.\n\n==History==\nMany naval staffs began to appreciate the possibility of using aircraft to launch torpedoes against moored ships in the period before the First World War. Captain [[Alessandro Guidoni]], an Italian naval captain, experimented with dropping weights from [[Farman MF.7]] in 1912.<ref>Chant, Chris. The world`s great bombers. Barnes and Noble, New York. 1990. {{ISBN|978-0-7607-2012-7}}</ref> which led to [[Ra\u00fal Pateras Pescara]] and Guidoni developing a purpose-built torpedo bomber from which a 375 lb dummy torpedo was dropped in February 1914 but they abandoned their work shortly afterwards when the aircraft's performance proved inadequate. Admiral [[Bradley A. Fiske]] of the [[United States Navy]] took out a patent in 1912 for a torpedo carrying aircraft entitled \"Method of and apparatus for delivering submarine torpedoes from [[airship]]s.\" He suggested that aircraft would attack at night.<ref>US patent 1032394.</ref> [[Winston Churchill]], as [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] from October 1911 to May 1915, was a strong proponent of naval air power. He established the [[Royal Naval Air Service]] in April 1912 and took flying lessons to foster aviation development. Churchill ordered the RNAS to design reconnaissance spotters and torpedo bombers for the Fleet.<ref>Roskill.

It first flew in July 1913 and was loaded aboard the cruiser {{HMS|Hermes|1898|6}}, which had been converted to become the [[Royal Navy]]'s first [[seaplane tender]]. When the rival [[Sopwith Special]], designed from the outset as a torpedo bomber, failed to lift its payload off the water, Shorts converted the Type 81 to carry torpedoes in July 1914, just before the outbreak of the First World War.<ref>Barnes C.H. Shorts aircraft 1914-18: Putnam, London 1957.</ref>\n\nOn 28 July 1914, [[Arthur Longmore]] dropped the first aerial torpedo, a 14-inch 810&nbsp;lb torpedo, from a Type 81 at the Royal Naval Air Station Calshot.<ref name=\"jackson20\">Jackson 1993, p.20</ref> The support wires of the floats were moved to allow the torpedo to be carried above the water and a specially designed quick-release mechanism was used.<ref name=\"jackson20\" />\n\nThe first plane designed from the outset as a torpedo bomber was the five-seat floatplane biplane [[AD Seaplane Type 1000]] or AD1. However, it proved to be a failure. When the prototype built by [[J. Samuel White]] from the [[Isle of Wight]] first flew in June 1916, it was found to be too heavy and its float struts too weak for operations. Remaining orders were cancelled.<ref>Goodall, Mike. \"Wight Elephants: Murray Sueter's Quest for a Large Military Aircraft\". [[Air Enthusiast]], No. 73, January/February 1998.

It was operating from {{HMS|Ben-my-Chree}}, a [[seaplane carrier]] converted from a ferry. Fitted with an aircraft hangar, ''Ben-my-Chree'' was used to carry up to six biplanes with their wings folded back to reduce carrying space.\n\nThis was the first ship sunk by air-launched torpedo. Five days later, another ship supplying Turkish forces in the [[Gallipoli campaign]] against British, Australian and New Zealand troops was also sunk.\n\nProduction of the Short 184 continued until after the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice of 11 November 1918]], with a total of 936 built by several manufacturers. It served in eight navies, including the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], which built them under licence.<ref>Bruce J.M.  The Short 184 Profile Publications, Leatherhead, England, 2001.</ref>\n\nThe first torpedo bomber designed for operation from aircraft carriers was the [[Sopwith Cuckoo]]. First flown in June 1917, it was designed to take off from the Royal Navy's new aircraft carriers, but had to land on an airfield as [[arresting gear|arrester wires]], needed to stop an aircraft during landing on a ship, had not yet been perfected. The Admiralty planned to use five carriers and 100-120 Cuckoos to attack the German [[High Seas Fleet]], which had been sheltering in Kiel since the [[Battle of Jutland]] in 1916 but when the war ended only 90 Cuckoos had been completed.<ref>Layman R.D.

It reached squadrons in France too late to play a role in the First World War. Had the war continued, it would have been deployed as a torpedo bomber.\n\n=== Interwar years ===\n[[File:Hawker Horsley Flying a.jpg|thumb|The [[Hawker Horsley]]]]\nOf the major maritime nations, only Britain, Japan and the United States developed carrier-borne torpedo bombers after hostilities ceased in Europe. Initially, Japan purchased both ships and aircraft from Britain, as the Imperial Japanese Navy modelled itself on the Royal Navy. Of the three, only Britain and Japan also perceived a need for land-based torpedo bombers, though a number would be developed by other countries. Bordered by oceans against any possible foe, the United States ignored landplane torpedo bomber development.\n\nThe first landplane specifically designed as a torpedo bomber was the [[Hawker Horsley]]. By the mid 1930s, the torpedo bombers that would start the Second World War were being deployed. The [[Fairey Swordfish]] flew first in 1934, the [[Douglas TBD Devastator]] and [[Mitsubishi G3M]] ''(Nell)'' in 1935 and the [[Nakajima B5N]] ''(Kate)'' and [[Bristol Beaufort]] a year after that.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">David, Donald (ed.), The complete encyclopaedia of world aircraft.

Captain [[Lumley Lyster]] of the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Glorious}} proposed that his Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers could launch a night attack against Taranto. At that time, the Royal Navy was the only force in the world with this capability. The Swordfish, a three-seat biplane, looked outmoded, but its low stall speed made it an ideal platform for launching torpedoes into the shallow waters of Taranto. The torpedoes were adapted with wire cables attached to their nose and wooden fins at their tail to slow their fall and make a shallow impact with the water, which was only {{convert|39|ft|abbr=on}} deep.\n\n[[File:Italian ship BB LIttorio on November 12, 1940, after Taranto attack (P00090.091).jpg|thumb|The damaged battleship [[Italian battleship Littorio|Littorio]] after the [[Attack on Taranto|Taranto attack]]]]\n\nOn the night of 11 November 1940, 21 Swordfish left the new aircraft carrier {{HMS|Illustrious|87|6}}. Some carried bombs and flares, but the main force carried torpedoes. British decoy maneuvers and the Italians' lack of radar allowed the British to surprise the ill-prepared Italian fleet at anchor in Taranto. Three battleships were put out of action, half of the Italian fleet, for the loss of two Swordfish. Two airmen were killed and two others captured. The next day, the remaining Italian battleships withdrew to Naples, ceding control of the Mediterranean to the British.<ref>Stephen Martin: Grove, Eric Ed 1988.

The other five Beauforts on the mission failed to rendezvous due to bad weather.

They found the German battleship [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] in the eastern Atlantic battling a fierce gale. With the battleship's bow pitching up and down {{convert|60|ft|abbr=on}} in {{convert|80|mph|abbr=on}} winds, the Swordfish had to release their torpedoes into the troughs of waves to ensure they would run properly. Two torpedoes hit, the one fired by [[John Moffat (pilot)|John Moffat]] striking the rudder and jamming it so severely that the huge ship could only turn helplessly in wide circles. Later that day, battleships and destroyers of the Royal Navy cornered her, and ''Bismarck''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s crew scuttled her after sustaining severe damage from heavy gun fire and more torpedoes.<ref>Daily Mail London, 10 May 2009.</ref>\n[[File:Kaga B5N Pearl Harbor departure.jpg|left|thumb|A Japanese [[Nakajima B5N|B5N]] from the [[Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga|Kaga]] [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacking Pearl Harbour]] ]]\nIn the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]]'s fleet of six carriers launched 40 [[Nakajima B5N]]2 ''Kate'' torpedo bombers on Sunday, 7 December 1941. The Japanese struck the [[United States Pacific Fleet]] when it was moored in harbour. The torpedo bombers coordinated their attacks with dive bombers; the combined effort sank or damaged all eight of the battleships which they found moored in Pearl Harbor. The Japanese had studied the attack on Taranto and had practiced dropping specially modified [[Type 91 torpedo]]es in the shallow waters of [[Seto Inland Sea|Japan's Inland Sea]]. The Type 91 torpedo was considerably more capable than any others in the world at that time, being very fast and reliable, as well as allowing a much higher launch speed from a much greater altitude than other types. Only five Kates were lost in the attack.<ref>Peattie. Mark R.

His fleet included the First World War [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Repulse|1916|6}} and should also have had the new aircraft carrier {{HMS|Indomitable|92|6}} with a squadron of [[Sea Hurricane]]s. But the carrier was delayed for repairs after running aground in the harbour at [[Kingston, Jamaica]].\n\n[[File:Sea Battle off Malaya, Japanese painting, 1942 (SC 301094).jpg|thumb|An artist rendition of the [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|sinking of HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse]] ]]\n\nEight [[Mitsubishi G3M]] ''Nell'' twin-engine level bombers and 17 Nell torpedo bombers found the two capital ships without air cover in broad daylight. They scored just a single bomb hit on ''Repulse'' and a single torpedo hit on ''Prince of Wales''. The torpedo struck where the outer port propeller shaft exited the hull and ''Prince of Wales'' took on {{convert|2400|t|abbr=on}} of water through a ruptured stern gland. The battleship listed 12 degrees to port preventing the starboard side 5.25 inch anti-aircraft guns from depressing low enough to deter more torpedo bombers.\n\nA second squadron, this time of [[Mitsubishi G4M]] ''Betty'' torpedo bombers, now attacked both ships. ''Repulse'' had dodged 19 torpedoes by skillful steering, but now G4Ms attacked the bow from both sides and scored another hit. At about this point, ''Repulse'' radioed for defensive fighters. A squadron of 10 [[Royal Australian Air Force]] [[Brewster Buffalo]]s arrived an hour later to watch ''Prince of Wales'' sink. ''Repulse'' had already sunk. Each ship had been hit by four torpedoes out of 49 fired. The Japanese lost four aircraft. Neither G3Ms nor G4Ms carried defensive armament, which had been stripped to extend their range. The presence of modern Allied fighters to defend the two capital ships might have led to a different outcome.<ref>Stephen, Martin: Sea battles in close-up Shepperton, England.

''Prinz Eugen'' had accompanied ''Bismarck'' into the Atlantic, but returned to Brest. For the first time, the Beauforts were accompanied by [[Bristol Beaufighter]]s and [[Bristol Blenheim]]s.  In a new RAF tactic, the Blenheims acted as decoys, making pretense torpedo runs, while the Beaufighters, a development of the Beaufort fitted with four 20mm cannon, shot up the anti-aircraft gunners. This was intended to give the Beauforts a clear torpedo run. However, none of the 28 Beauforts achieved a hit, and three aircraft were lost.<ref name=\"Robertson\" />\n[[File:TBDs on USS Enterprise (CV-6) during Battle of Midway.jpg|left|thumb|[[Douglas TBD Devastator|TBD Devastators]] on [[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|USS Enterprise]] during the [[Battle of Midway]]]]\nThe United States Navy's standard torpedo bomber in 1942 was the [[Douglas TBD Devastator]], first flown in 1935 and embarked on carriers of the Pacific Fleet in 1937.

Avengers from ''Yorktown'' were searching between [[Okinawa]] and [[Honshu]] for the Japanese battleship [[Japanese battleship Yamato|''Yamato'']], which was escorted by cruisers and destroyers. Her mission was to run aground on Okinawa to provide floating heavy artillery for the defending troops in the expected Allied seaborne invasion. Her 18.1 inch guns could have created havoc among frail landing craft. ''Yamato'' and her sister the [[Japanese battleship Musashi|''Musashi'']] were the largest, most powerful battleships in the world. Planned in great secrecy, they had been designed to take on three American battleships each and win.\n\nThe squadron led by Lieutenant Tom Stetson found the cruiser, which was the prime target, already sinking, so six planes were detached to attack the ''Yamato'' instead. One in which Frederick E. Wicklund was the tail gunner and radar/radio operator became detached from the formation whilst climbing in heavy cloud cover. The pilot, Lieutenant Grady Jean, asked each crewman in turn if they wished to make a solo attack, which was likely to prove suicidal. The crew referred the decision to the skipper, who deftly dodged anti-aircraft fire and 18-inch shell splashes from the ''Yamato''{{'}}s big guns to release their torpedo. Wicklund had recalled from a briefing that the ''Yamato'' had [[torpedo blister]]s to a depth of {{convert|22|ft|abbr=on}}, so he crawled back in the fuselage to reset the torpedo's running depth from the {{convert|10|ft|abbr=on}} preset for the cruiser to {{convert|23|ft|abbr=on}}. He later explained that he heard no command to do this and doubted whether the other five planes had done so. In their case, their torpedoes would have exploded harmlessly against the blisters. A crewman photographed the explosion, in which debris rose to their altitude of {{Convert|300|ft|m}}. Possibly a torpedo had hit the fuel storage. The ''Yamato'' rolled over and sank, with the loss of 90 percent of the crew. The ''Yorktown'' lost ten planes and twelve aircrew. All pilots involved in the attack were awarded the [[Navy Medal]] and every crewman the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]].<ref>\"The Real Story of the ''Yamato'' Sinking\".

This configuration was favoured by the US Navy, in particular, and included the [[Martin AM Mauler]] and [[Douglas A-1 Skyraider]], both of which could carry up to three torpedoes.\nAnother concept, the '''[[strike fighter|torpedo fighter]]''', also known as the '''strike fighter''', was intended to also have [[air superiority fighter|air superiority]] capabilities \u2013 when it was not carrying or had dropped its torpedo. However, the radically differing requirements of these two roles created design constraints that made it difficult for a single design to excel at both. While some torpedo fighters were put into production, such as the [[Fiat G.55#Torpedo fighter|Fiat G.55S]] and [[Blackburn Firebrand]], they seldom launched torpedoes at enemy ships.\n\nFrom 1946, the US Navy officially discarded its [[1922 United States Navy aircraft designation system|separate designations]] for dive and torpedo bombers, and introduced a single \"Attack\" designation, similar to that already used by the USAAF. Conversely, the naval air services of the UK and other Commonwealth countries, persisted with specialised torpedo bombers such as the [[Grumman Avenger]] until the early 1960s.\n\nWhile the importance of air-launched torpedoes declined, relative to [[antiship missile]]s, during the [[Cold War]] and subsequently, they were retained by many air services and are now generally delivered by [[anti-submarine warfare]] and [[maritime patrol aircraft]].\n\n==Tactics==\n{{Refimprove section|date=February 2012}}\n[[File:Japanese aircraft attack USS Hornet (CV-8) during the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands on 26 October 1942 (80-G-33947).jpg|thumb|The Japanese coordinated attack on the [[USS Hornet (CV-8)|USS Hornet]] during the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands|battle of Santa Cruz]]|alt=]]\nOne crucial limitation of a torpedo bomber was that it had to fly a long, straight course at a constant altitude of {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} toward the target ship before launching its torpedo. Torpedoes were very complicated weapons and were prone to damage when landing on water, especially on a wave; they were ideally aimed at the bottom of a wave, but this was difficult to achieve in practice.\n\nDuring a torpedo run, the attacking aircraft were easy targets for defending [[combat air patrol]] fighters. Furthermore, torpedo planes were also highly vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire, particularly the heavy anti-aircraft guns (such as the [[5\"/38 caliber gun|5 inch DP]]) which fired into the water, creating water spouts to slap the torpedo planes.\n[[File:Anvil Attack.png|thumb|\"Anvil\" torpedo attack]]\nIn the 1930s, the Imperial Japanese Navy developed the best way for torpedo bombers to achieve a hit. They used an \"anvil attack\", in which two groups of torpedo planes approached the target ship's bow from behind at an angle of about 45 degrees,{{clarify|date=April 2015|reason=45 degrees to the bow or to each other?}} one on each side of the ship. The torpedoes were to be launched at the same distance from the ship; this would have ensured a hit no matter where the ship tried to maneuver. In practice, this kind of attack was difficult to coordinate and therefore extremely rare. Usually, combat air patrols and anti-aircraft fire quickly broke up approaching plane formations, forcing each aircraft to attack on its own. At Pearl Harbor, the ships were lined up and basically stationary, so the first attack wave of 40 torpedo bombers armed with [[Type 91 torpedo]]es, out of 183 planes, were able to hit the ships broadside, as the defenders were caught by surprise.\n\nTorpedo bombers were best used as part of a coordinated attack with other types of aircraft. For instance, during the attack on the [[Japanese battleship Yamato|battleship ''Yamato'']], fighter planes strafed the ship with [[machine gun]]s to suppress its anti-aircraft gun fire, while [[dive bomber]]s tried to cause havoc and inflict topside damage, thus leaving the torpedo bombers unmolested in their attack runs.\n\nHowever, if the attackers failed to achieve [[air superiority]] or surprise, torpedo bombers suffered heavy losses, regardless of whether the type was obsolete or not. This is best exemplified at the Battle of Midway, where Air Group Eight's dive bombers missed the Japanese carriers.<ref>Mrazek, Robert, \"A Dawn Like Thunder\", testimony from surviving pilots</ref> Torpedo Squadron 8 (VT-8, from ''Hornet''), led by Lieutenant Commander [[John C. Waldron]], sighted the enemy carriers and attacked without any coordination with dive bombers or fighter cover. Without fighter escort, every TBD Devastator of VT-8 was shot down without inflicting any damage, with Ensign [[George H. Gay, Jr.]] being the only survivor. VT-8 was followed by Torpedo Squadron 6 (VT-6, from ''Enterprise''). VT-6 met nearly the same fate, with no hits to show for its effort. The Japanese combat air patrol, flying the much faster Mitsubishi A6M2 \"Zeros\", made short work of the unescorted, slow, under-armed TBDs torpedo bombers. A few TBDs managed get within a few ship-lengths range of their targets before dropping their torpedoes.\n\nAt the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]] in 1942, the Nakajima B5N ''Kate'', despite being in service since 1935,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> played a key role in sinking USS ''Hornet'', while the new [[Grumman TBF Avenger]] torpedo bombers failed to hit a fleet carrier.\n\nWhen the targets were ships able to maneuver at high speed and hence much harder to hit, torpedoes proved less effective, except in cases when the crews launching them were especially well trained. Still, even a single torpedo hit on an enemy warship could cripple it decisively, especially in the case of vessels without an armored belt (cruisers and aircraft carriers often had torpedo blisters, but these were not as extensive as those of battleships). Even on heavily armored battleships, there was nothing to protect the rudder and propellers at the stern, as was demonstrated in the cases of the ''Bismarck'' and ''Prince of Wales'' and ''Repulse'', and few had their protective belt extend to the extremities, and a hole made in the bow could be forced wider from the pressure of the water which could buckle and crush unarmored internal bulkheads, which worked against ''Yamato''.\n\n==Notable torpedo bomber pilots==\n*[[Charles T.

Torpedo bombers came into existence just before the [[World War I|First World War]] almost as soon as aircraft were built that were capable of carrying the weight of a torpedo, and remained an important aircraft type until they were rendered obsolete by [[anti-ship missile]]s. They were an important element in many famous [[World War II|Second World War]] battles, notably the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Battle of Taranto|attack at Taranto]], the sinking of the German battleship [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']], and the [[Japan]]ese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].\n\n==Types==\n[[File:The Royal Navy during the Second World War A20170.jpg|left|thumb|A formation of [[Fairey Barracuda]] during [[WW2]] ]]\n\nTorpedo bombers first appeared immediately prior to the First World War. Generally, they carried [[torpedo]]es specifically designed for air launch, which were smaller and lighter than those used by [[submarine]]s and surface warships. Nonetheless, as an airborne torpedo could weigh as much as {{convert|2000|lb|kg}}, more than twice the bomb load of contemporary single-engined bombers, the aircraft carrying it usually needed to be specially designed for the purpose. Many early torpedo bombers were [[floatplane]]s, such as the [[Short 184]] (the first aircraft to sink a ship with a torpedo), and the undercarriage had to be redesigned so that the torpedo could be dropped from the aircraft's centerline.\n\nWhile many torpedo bombers were single-engine aircraft, some multi-engined aircraft have also been used as torpedo bombers, with the [[Mitsubishi G3M]] ''Nell'' and [[Mitsubishi G4M]] ''Betty'' being used in the [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|sinking of ''Prince of Wales'' and ''Repulse'']]. Other twin-engine or three-engined aircraft designed or used as torpedo bombers include the [[Mitsubishi Ki-67]], the [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.79]] \"Sparviero\", the [[CANT Z.1007]], the [[Bristol Beaufort]] and [[Bristol Beaufighter]] (\"Torbeau\"), the [[Junkers Ju 88]], the [[Heinkel He 111]], the [[B-25 Mitchell]] and many others.\n\nSome postwar jet aircraft (such as the [[Ilyushin Il-28]]T) were adapted as torpedo bombers in the late 1940s and 1950s. The last known torpedo bomber attack was made by US Navy [[Douglas A-1 Skyraider|Skyraiders]] against the [[Hwacheon Dam]] during the [[Korean War]]. The [[North Korean Air Force]] finally retired the world's last operational torpedo bombers in the 1980s.\n\nIn a parallel development, many maritime strike aircraft and helicopters have been capable of launching guided torpedoes; however, they are not generally referred to as torpedo bombers because of their vastly greater detection and tracking capabilities, although they remain just as capable of making attacks on surface ships as against submarines.\n\n==History==\nMany naval staffs began to appreciate the possibility of using aircraft to launch torpedoes against moored ships in the period before the First World War. Captain [[Alessandro Guidoni]], an Italian naval captain, experimented with dropping weights from [[Farman MF.7]] in 1912.<ref>Chant, Chris. The world`s great bombers. Barnes and Noble, New York. 1990. {{ISBN|978-0-7607-2012-7}}</ref> which led to [[Ra\u00fal Pateras Pescara]] and Guidoni developing a purpose-built torpedo bomber from which a 375 lb dummy torpedo was dropped in February 1914 but they abandoned their work shortly afterwards when the aircraft's performance proved inadequate. Admiral [[Bradley A. Fiske]] of the [[United States Navy]] took out a patent in 1912 for a torpedo carrying aircraft entitled \"Method of and apparatus for delivering submarine torpedoes from [[airship]]s.\" He suggested that aircraft would attack at night.<ref>US patent 1032394.</ref> [[Winston Churchill]], as [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] from October 1911 to May 1915, was a strong proponent of naval air power. He established the [[Royal Naval Air Service]] in April 1912 and took flying lessons to foster aviation development. Churchill ordered the RNAS to design reconnaissance spotters and torpedo bombers for the Fleet.<ref>Roskill.

It first flew in July 1913 and was loaded aboard the cruiser {{HMS|Hermes|1898|6}}, which had been converted to become the [[Royal Navy]]'s first [[seaplane tender]]. When the rival [[Sopwith Special]], designed from the outset as a torpedo bomber, failed to lift its payload off the water, Shorts converted the Type 81 to carry torpedoes in July 1914, just before the outbreak of the First World War.<ref>Barnes C.H.

However, it proved to be a failure. When the prototype built by [[J. Samuel White]] from the [[Isle of Wight]] first flew in June 1916, it was found to be too heavy and its float struts too weak for operations. Remaining orders were cancelled.<ref>Goodall, Mike. \"Wight Elephants: Murray Sueter's Quest for a Large Military Aircraft\". [[Air Enthusiast]], No. 73, January/February 1998.

It was operating from {{HMS|Ben-my-Chree}}, a [[seaplane carrier]] converted from a ferry. Fitted with an aircraft hangar, ''Ben-my-Chree'' was used to carry up to six biplanes with their wings folded back to reduce carrying space.\n\nThis was the first ship sunk by air-launched torpedo. Five days later, another ship supplying Turkish forces in the [[Gallipoli campaign]] against British, Australian and New Zealand troops was also sunk.\n\nProduction of the Short 184 continued until after the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice of 11 November 1918]], with a total of 936 built by several manufacturers. It served in eight navies, including the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], which built them under licence.<ref>Bruce J.M.  The Short 184 Profile Publications, Leatherhead, England, 2001.</ref>\n\nThe first torpedo bomber designed for operation from aircraft carriers was the [[Sopwith Cuckoo]]. First flown in June 1917, it was designed to take off from the Royal Navy's new aircraft carriers, but had to land on an airfield as [[arresting gear|arrester wires]], needed to stop an aircraft during landing on a ship, had not yet been perfected. The Admiralty planned to use five carriers and 100-120 Cuckoos to attack the German [[High Seas Fleet]], which had been sheltering in Kiel since the [[Battle of Jutland]] in 1916 but when the war ended only 90 Cuckoos had been completed.<ref>Layman R.D.

It reached squadrons in France too late to play a role in the First World War. Had the war continued, it would have been deployed as a torpedo bomber.\n\n=== Interwar years ===\n[[File:Hawker Horsley Flying a.jpg|thumb|The [[Hawker Horsley]]]]\nOf the major maritime nations, only Britain, Japan and the United States developed carrier-borne torpedo bombers after hostilities ceased in Europe. Initially, Japan purchased both ships and aircraft from Britain, as the Imperial Japanese Navy modelled itself on the Royal Navy. Of the three, only Britain and Japan also perceived a need for land-based torpedo bombers, though a number would be developed by other countries. Bordered by oceans against any possible foe, the United States ignored landplane torpedo bomber development.\n\nThe first landplane specifically designed as a torpedo bomber was the [[Hawker Horsley]]. By the mid 1930s, the torpedo bombers that would start the Second World War were being deployed. The [[Fairey Swordfish]] flew first in 1934, the [[Douglas TBD Devastator]] and [[Mitsubishi G3M]] ''(Nell)'' in 1935 and the [[Nakajima B5N]] ''(Kate)'' and [[Bristol Beaufort]] a year after that.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">David, Donald (ed.), The complete encyclopaedia of world aircraft.

Captain [[Lumley Lyster]] of the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Glorious}} proposed that his Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers could launch a night attack against Taranto. At that time, the Royal Navy was the only force in the world with this capability. The Swordfish, a three-seat biplane, looked outmoded, but its low stall speed made it an ideal platform for launching torpedoes into the shallow waters of Taranto. The torpedoes were adapted with wire cables attached to their nose and wooden fins at their tail to slow their fall and make a shallow impact with the water, which was only {{convert|39|ft|abbr=on}} deep.\n\n[[File:Italian ship BB LIttorio on November 12, 1940, after Taranto attack (P00090.091).jpg|thumb|The damaged battleship [[Italian battleship Littorio|Littorio]] after the [[Attack on Taranto|Taranto attack]]]]\n\nOn the night of 11 November 1940, 21 Swordfish left the new aircraft carrier {{HMS|Illustrious|87|6}}. Some carried bombs and flares, but the main force carried torpedoes. British decoy maneuvers and the Italians' lack of radar allowed the British to surprise the ill-prepared Italian fleet at anchor in Taranto. Three battleships were put out of action, half of the Italian fleet, for the loss of two Swordfish. Two airmen were killed and two others captured. The next day, the remaining Italian battleships withdrew to Naples, ceding control of the Mediterranean to the British.<ref>Stephen Martin: Grove, Eric Ed 1988.

With the battleship's bow pitching up and down {{convert|60|ft|abbr=on}} in {{convert|80|mph|abbr=on}} winds, the Swordfish had to release their torpedoes into the troughs of waves to ensure they would run properly. Two torpedoes hit, the one fired by [[John Moffat (pilot)|John Moffat]] striking the rudder and jamming it so severely that the huge ship could only turn helplessly in wide circles.

The Japanese struck the [[United States Pacific Fleet]] when it was moored in harbour. The torpedo bombers coordinated their attacks with dive bombers; the combined effort sank or damaged all eight of the battleships which they found moored in Pearl Harbor. The Japanese had studied the attack on Taranto and had practiced dropping specially modified [[Type 91 torpedo]]es in the shallow waters of [[Seto Inland Sea|Japan's Inland Sea]]. The Type 91 torpedo was considerably more capable than any others in the world at that time, being very fast and reliable, as well as allowing a much higher launch speed from a much greater altitude than other types.

They scored just a single bomb hit on ''Repulse'' and a single torpedo hit on ''Prince of Wales''. The torpedo struck where the outer port propeller shaft exited the hull and ''Prince of Wales'' took on {{convert|2400|t|abbr=on}} of water through a ruptured stern gland. The battleship listed 12 degrees to port preventing the starboard side 5.25 inch anti-aircraft guns from depressing low enough to deter more torpedo bombers.\n\nA second squadron, this time of [[Mitsubishi G4M]] ''Betty'' torpedo bombers, now attacked both ships. ''Repulse'' had dodged 19 torpedoes by skillful steering, but now G4Ms attacked the bow from both sides and scored another hit. At about this point, ''Repulse'' radioed for defensive fighters. A squadron of 10 [[Royal Australian Air Force]] [[Brewster Buffalo]]s arrived an hour later to watch ''Prince of Wales'' sink. ''Repulse'' had already sunk. Each ship had been hit by four torpedoes out of 49 fired. The Japanese lost four aircraft. Neither G3Ms nor G4Ms carried defensive armament, which had been stripped to extend their range.

''Prinz Eugen'' had accompanied ''Bismarck'' into the Atlantic, but returned to Brest. For the first time, the Beauforts were accompanied by [[Bristol Beaufighter]]s and [[Bristol Blenheim]]s.  In a new RAF tactic, the Blenheims acted as decoys, making pretense torpedo runs, while the Beaufighters, a development of the Beaufort fitted with four 20mm cannon, shot up the anti-aircraft gunners.

Avengers from ''Yorktown'' were searching between [[Okinawa]] and [[Honshu]] for the Japanese battleship [[Japanese battleship Yamato|''Yamato'']], which was escorted by cruisers and destroyers. Her mission was to run aground on Okinawa to provide floating heavy artillery for the defending troops in the expected Allied seaborne invasion. Her 18.1 inch guns could have created havoc among frail landing craft. ''Yamato'' and her sister the [[Japanese battleship Musashi|''Musashi'']] were the largest, most powerful battleships in the world. Planned in great secrecy, they had been designed to take on three American battleships each and win.\n\nThe squadron led by Lieutenant Tom Stetson found the cruiser, which was the prime target, already sinking, so six planes were detached to attack the ''Yamato'' instead. One in which Frederick E. Wicklund was the tail gunner and radar/radio operator became detached from the formation whilst climbing in heavy cloud cover. The pilot, Lieutenant Grady Jean, asked each crewman in turn if they wished to make a solo attack, which was likely to prove suicidal. The crew referred the decision to the skipper, who deftly dodged anti-aircraft fire and 18-inch shell splashes from the ''Yamato''{{'}}s big guns to release their torpedo. Wicklund had recalled from a briefing that the ''Yamato'' had [[torpedo blister]]s to a depth of {{convert|22|ft|abbr=on}}, so he crawled back in the fuselage to reset the torpedo's running depth from the {{convert|10|ft|abbr=on}} preset for the cruiser to {{convert|23|ft|abbr=on}}. He later explained that he heard no command to do this and doubted whether the other five planes had done so. In their case, their torpedoes would have exploded harmlessly against the blisters. A crewman photographed the explosion, in which debris rose to their altitude of {{Convert|300|ft|m}}. Possibly a torpedo had hit the fuel storage. The ''Yamato'' rolled over and sank, with the loss of 90 percent of the crew. The ''Yorktown'' lost ten planes and twelve aircrew.

This configuration was favoured by the US Navy, in particular, and included the [[Martin AM Mauler]] and [[Douglas A-1 Skyraider]], both of which could carry up to three torpedoes.\nAnother concept, the '''[[strike fighter|torpedo fighter]]''', also known as the '''strike fighter''', was intended to also have [[air superiority fighter|air superiority]] capabilities \u2013 when it was not carrying or had dropped its torpedo. However, the radically differing requirements of these two roles created design constraints that made it difficult for a single design to excel at both. While some torpedo fighters were put into production, such as the [[Fiat G.55#Torpedo fighter|Fiat G.55S]] and [[Blackburn Firebrand]], they seldom launched torpedoes at enemy ships.\n\nFrom 1946, the US Navy officially discarded its [[1922 United States Navy aircraft designation system|separate designations]] for dive and torpedo bombers, and introduced a single \"Attack\" designation, similar to that already used by the USAAF. Conversely, the naval air services of the UK and other Commonwealth countries, persisted with specialised torpedo bombers such as the [[Grumman Avenger]] until the early 1960s.\n\nWhile the importance of air-launched torpedoes declined, relative to [[antiship missile]]s, during the [[Cold War]] and subsequently, they were retained by many air services and are now generally delivered by [[anti-submarine warfare]] and [[maritime patrol aircraft]].\n\n==Tactics==\n{{Refimprove section|date=February 2012}}\n[[File:Japanese aircraft attack USS Hornet (CV-8) during the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands on 26 October 1942 (80-G-33947).jpg|thumb|The Japanese coordinated attack on the [[USS Hornet (CV-8)|USS Hornet]] during the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands|battle of Santa Cruz]]|alt=]]\nOne crucial limitation of a torpedo bomber was that it had to fly a long, straight course at a constant altitude of {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} toward the target ship before launching its torpedo. Torpedoes were very complicated weapons and were prone to damage when landing on water, especially on a wave; they were ideally aimed at the bottom of a wave, but this was difficult to achieve in practice.\n\nDuring a torpedo run, the attacking aircraft were easy targets for defending [[combat air patrol]] fighters. Furthermore, torpedo planes were also highly vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire, particularly the heavy anti-aircraft guns (such as the [[5\"/38 caliber gun|5 inch DP]]) which fired into the water, creating water spouts to slap the torpedo planes.\n[[File:Anvil Attack.png|thumb|\"Anvil\" torpedo attack]]\nIn the 1930s, the Imperial Japanese Navy developed the best way for torpedo bombers to achieve a hit. They used an \"anvil attack\", in which two groups of torpedo planes approached the target ship's bow from behind at an angle of about 45 degrees,{{clarify|date=April 2015|reason=45 degrees to the bow or to each other?}} one on each side of the ship. The torpedoes were to be launched at the same distance from the ship; this would have ensured a hit no matter where the ship tried to maneuver. In practice, this kind of attack was difficult to coordinate and therefore extremely rare. Usually, combat air patrols and anti-aircraft fire quickly broke up approaching plane formations, forcing each aircraft to attack on its own. At Pearl Harbor, the ships were lined up and basically stationary, so the first attack wave of 40 torpedo bombers armed with [[Type 91 torpedo]]es, out of 183 planes, were able to hit the ships broadside, as the defenders were caught by surprise.\n\nTorpedo bombers were best used as part of a coordinated attack with other types of aircraft. For instance, during the attack on the [[Japanese battleship Yamato|battleship ''Yamato'']], fighter planes strafed the ship with [[machine gun]]s to suppress its anti-aircraft gun fire, while [[dive bomber]]s tried to cause havoc and inflict topside damage, thus leaving the torpedo bombers unmolested in their attack runs.\n\nHowever, if the attackers failed to achieve [[air superiority]] or surprise, torpedo bombers suffered heavy losses, regardless of whether the type was obsolete or not. This is best exemplified at the Battle of Midway, where Air Group Eight's dive bombers missed the Japanese carriers.<ref>Mrazek, Robert, \"A Dawn Like Thunder\", testimony from surviving pilots</ref> Torpedo Squadron 8 (VT-8, from ''Hornet''), led by Lieutenant Commander [[John C. Waldron]], sighted the enemy carriers and attacked without any coordination with dive bombers or fighter cover. Without fighter escort, every TBD Devastator of VT-8 was shot down without inflicting any damage, with Ensign [[George H. Gay, Jr.]] being the only survivor. VT-8 was followed by Torpedo Squadron 6 (VT-6, from ''Enterprise''). VT-6 met nearly the same fate, with no hits to show for its effort. The Japanese combat air patrol, flying the much faster Mitsubishi A6M2 \"Zeros\", made short work of the unescorted, slow, under-armed TBDs torpedo bombers. A few TBDs managed get within a few ship-lengths range of their targets before dropping their torpedoes.\n\nAt the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]] in 1942, the Nakajima B5N ''Kate'', despite being in service since 1935,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> played a key role in sinking USS ''Hornet'', while the new [[Grumman TBF Avenger]] torpedo bombers failed to hit a fleet carrier.\n\nWhen the targets were ships able to maneuver at high speed and hence much harder to hit, torpedoes proved less effective, except in cases when the crews launching them were especially well trained. Still, even a single torpedo hit on an enemy warship could cripple it decisively, especially in the case of vessels without an armored belt (cruisers and aircraft carriers often had torpedo blisters, but these were not as extensive as those of battleships). Even on heavily armored battleships, there was nothing to protect the rudder and propellers at the stern, as was demonstrated in the cases of the ''Bismarck'' and ''Prince of Wales'' and ''Repulse'', and few had their protective belt extend to the extremities, and a hole made in the bow could be forced wider from the pressure of the water which could buckle and crush unarmored internal bulkheads, which worked against ''Yamato''.\n\n==Notable torpedo bomber pilots==\n*[[Charles T.
