It is bordered by [[Aia]] to the east and the south and [[Getaria, Gipuzkoa|Getaria]] to the west. It has four [[enclave]]s limiting the aforementioned municipalities: Alkortiaga, Ekano, Sola, and Arbestain. It's located about {{convert|15|km}} west of [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]]. {{As of|2014}}, Zarautz has a population of 22,890, which usually swells to about 60,000 in the summer.\n\nThe Palace of Narros, located adjacent to Zarautz's 2.8&nbsp;km long beach, is where Queen [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and [[Queen Fabiola of Belgium|Fabiola of Belgium]] once spent their summer holidays. The beach is known for being the longest in the Basque Country and one of longest of the Cantabrian cornice.\n\nThe Mayor of Zarautz since 2015 has been Xabier Txurruka ([[Basque Nationalist Party]]).\n\n==History==\n*1237: The site is founded as a town and its Navarrese [[fuero|charters]] confirmed by king [[Fernando III of Castile]].\n*1857: The beginning of the Industrial Revolution in Zarautz, thanks to the enterprise \"Fabril Linera\". An era of economic growth and development begins.\n*1936: The Civil War begins and Zarautz overwhelmingly supports the Republican cause.\n*1936: The province falls to [[Falange|Falangist]] forces in the [[Spanish Civil War]], who carry out reprisals against the Basque nationalists.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, and the beginning of the 20th century, the popularity of Zarautz as a luxury tourist destination grew, and many well-known people began to holiday there. A number of lavish houses and mansions sprang up, particularly along the beach. Nowadays, many of these buildings have become public buildings or have been demolished and replaced by chic apartment buildings.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Zarautz became a more affordable destination, and is now perhaps best known for its surfing and water sports.\n\n==Infrastructure and transport==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\n===Road===\nZarautz is connected to the European road network and to the rest of Spain by the A8 motorway.\n\n===Gastronomy===\nAs it is tradition in the Basque Country, gastronomy is a very important part of Zarautz. Many restaurants can be found in Zarautz, offering traditional as well as modern fine cuisine. Zarautz is home town of one of the most famous cooks in Spain, [[Karlos Argui\u00f1ano]], whose restaurant can be found right in front of the beach. He also created a prestigious cooking school called [[Aiala]].\nAs in all cities around [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|The Basque Country]] there are a lot of gastronomical societies in Zarautz. They are very traditional and called [[Txoko]] in Basque.\n\n===Public transport===\nZarautz has two railway stations, and trains ([[Euskotren]]) connect it with San Sebastian and Bilbao.\n\nZarautz has two bus lines operating within the town.\n\n===Museums===\nThere are two museums in Zarautz, the Photomuseum [http://www.photomuseum.name] and the Art and History Museum of Zarautz [http://www.menosca.com]. In \"Dorre Luzea\" there are frequent art exhibitions. The town also has many other picture galleries.\n\n===Churches===\nThere are three main churches in Zarautz and many other smaller churches. Santa Maria la Real is the main church, with a very interesting altar piece and a Romanesque structure. Santa Clara is also quite interesting, built in a baroque style. Finally, Franciscanos church, which has been virtually rebuilt, features a very interesting library.\n\n==Recreation==\nZarautz has first class sporting facilities, such as an old and elegant Golf Club. But Zarautz is renowned worldwide as a surfing destination. Over the last few years, it has become incredibly popular among surfers, and even a number of surfing schools have been established (Zarautz, Pukas).\n\n==Sport==\nZarautz is the birthplace of the Basque Weightlifting Federation as well as the Gipuzkoa Weightlifting Federation. Since 1968 [[Powerlifting|weightlifting]] (ZKEhalterofilia) has been one of the sports that can be practiced at the local sports club (Zarautz Kirol Elkartea). Since then, every summer an international weightlifting event has taken place in the town. At first, very famous athletes took part in that competition such as [[Serge Reding]] and [[Alain Terme]] to name a few. In recent times, the event has become a club competition in which the French champion Girondins de Bordeaux has won most of the top prizes.\n\nThe town is also famous as one of Spain's most popular surfing spots. Its 2.5&nbsp;km beach offers highly consistent surfing with many different peaks for all standards of surfers. The town is a great place to learn how to surf and has been home to many of Spain's Champion surfers. Zarautz is one of the stops of the World Surf League's Qualifying Series.<ref>https://www.worldsurfleague.com/events/2019/mqs/3010/cabreiro-pro-zarautz-basque-country</ref>\n\n==Twin towns and sister cities==\n*{{flagicon|ITA}} [[Cardano al Campo]], Italy\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Pontarlier]], France\n*{{flagicon|ESH}} [[Hagunia]], Western Sahara\n\n==See also==\n*[[1980 Zarautz attack]] an ETA attack which killed five people in the town.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.zarautz.org Official website] {{in lang|es|eu}}\n*[http://www.turismozarautz.com Tourism in Zarautz]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060823165323/http://www.alaplaya.com/ Village beaches website]\n\n{{commons category}}\n{{Municipalities in Gipuzkoa}}\n\n{{coord|43|17|N|2|10|W|region:ES_type:city|display=title}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities in Gipuzkoa]]\n[[Category:Tourism in Spain]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Gipuzkoa]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n| name                    = Zarautz\n| native_name             =\n| other_name              =\n| translit_lang1_type     = Spanish\n| translit_lang1_info     = Zarautz\n| settlement_type         = Municipality\n| image_skyline           = Zarautz Vue Camping.jpg\n| image_alt               =\n| image_caption           = Zarautz \n| image_size=350px\n| image_flag              = \n| flag_alt                =\n| image_shield            = Coat of Arms of Zarautz.svg\n| shield_alt              =\n| nickname                =\n| motto                   =\n| image_map               =\n| mapsize                 =\n| map_alt                 =\n| map_caption             =\n| pushpin_map             = Spain Basque Country#Spain\n| pushpin_label_position  =\n| pushpin_map_alt         =\n| pushpin_map_caption     = Location in Spain\n| pushpin_map1             = Spain Basque Country\n| pushpin_label_position1  = \n| pushpin_map_alt1         =\n| pushpin_map_caption1     = Location in [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]\n| coordinates             = {{coord|43|17|11|N|2|10|29|W|type:city|display=inline}}\n| coordinates_footnotes   =\n| subdivision_type        = [[Country]]\n| subdivision_name        = [[Spain]]\n| subdivision_type1       = [[Autonomous Community]]\n| subdivision_name1       = [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]\n| subdivision_type2       = [[Provinces of Spain|Province]]\n| subdivision_name2       = [[Gipuzkoa]]\n| subdivision_type3       = [[Comarca|Eskualdea]]\n| subdivision_name3       = [[Urola Kosta]]\n| established_title       = \n| established_date        = \n| founder                 = \n| leader_party            = [[Basque Nationalist Party|EAJ-PNV]]\n| leader_title            = Mayor\n| leader_name             = Xabier Txurruka Fern\u00e1ndez      \n| area_footnotes          =\n| area_total_km2          = 14.8\n| elevation_footnotes     = ([[AMSL]])\n| elevation_m             = 4\n| population_as_of        = {{Spain metadata Wikidata|population_as_of}}\n| population_footnotes    = {{Spain metadata Wikidata|population_footnotes}}\n| population_total        = {{Spain metadata Wikidata|population_total}}\n| population_rank         = \n| population_density_km2  = auto\n| population_demonym      =\n| timezone1               = [[Central European Time|CET]]\n| utc_offset1             = +1\n| timezone1_DST           = CEST (GMT +2)\n| utc_offset1_DST         = +2\n| postal_code_type        = [[Postal code]]\n| postal_code             = 20800\n| area_code               = [[+34]] (Spain) + 943 (Gipuzkoa)\n| twin1                   = \n| twin1_country           = \n| website                 = {{official website|http://www.zarautz.eus/}}\n| footnotes               =\n}}\n\n'''Zarautz''' ({{lang-es|Zarauz}}) is a coastal town located in central [[Gipuzkoa]], in [[Spain]].

Ron Gray also joined the band as a second guitarist after the recording of ''The Splinter Shards the Birth of Separation''.

Detar suggested a pair of his friends, guitarist Russ Cogdell and enigmatic{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} writer / poet (and future tattoo artist) [[Daniel Weyandt|Dan Weyandt]]. Both Cogdell and Weyandt had played in Christian hardcore band [[Seasons in the Field]], who had released a split EP with Pensive.<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/> Smith would drive several hours to Greensburg, where all these new members lived, to co-write and rehearse what would become the first (and in many ways, defining) album from the new Zao, ''[[Where Blood and Fire Bring Rest]]''. The group played fewer and fewer songs from the old version of the band as ''Blood and Fire'' took hold. They toured without a bassist and set stages ablaze with their raw emotion and Weyandt's personal storytelling, which detailed the hardships that informed their songs. With a rockabilly look and Smith's oddly engaging habit of setting up his drums facing away from the audience, their live reputation grew large in the underground. Not long after recording their half of a split EP with labelmates [[Training for Utopia]] in California, Detar left the group in 1999 to focus his energy on his [[rock music|rock]] side-project [[The Juliana Theory]], who would sign to Sony and have a successful career before disbanding in 2006.<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/>\n\nScott Mellinger (formerly of [[Creation Is Crucifixion]]) joined the band on lead guitar, and Rob Horner came in on bass, before the recording of another landmark [[metalcore]] album, ''[[Liberate Te Ex Inferis]]'' (Latin for \"Save Yourself from Hell\", a line from the movie ''[[Event Horizon (film)|Event Horizon]]''). Cogdell left the band in 2000 to go to film school.\n\nMellinger, Horner and Smith wrote and recorded all of the music for Zao's fifth album titled ''[[(Self-Titled)]]'', with Dan coming by for a few days to contribute his lyrics and vocals. The album is notable for Smith's dark pop interludes, the [[Roland V-Drums|V-Drum]] sound and the song \"Five Year Winter\", which remains a signature Zao song.\n\nCorey Darst replaced Weyandt for the majority of the touring in support of the album, with Horner returning, and second guitarist Matt Auxier joining up. Darst never appeared on a Zao album although this version of the group (Darst, Smith, Mellinger and Horner) did cut a three-song demo during a Seattle tour stop. The group talked about signing with either [[Sanctuary Records|Sanctuary]] or [[Century Media Records]], but Zao \"broke up\" on stage at a December 2001 show in Pittsburgh (later documented on their DVD). They were to embark on a tour with The Juliana Theory and Weyandt had joined Darst onstage as a special guest, but an incapacitated Jesse Smith couldn't make it through the show and long-brewing tensions boiled over.\n\nSolid State / Tooth & Nail funded the next Zao projects: a brand new album that featured just Smith, Mellinger and Weyandt (Horner did not return) called ''[[Parade of Chaos]]'', as well as a re-recording of the original Zao's ''[[All Else Failed (2003 album)|All Else Failed]]'' played by the same trio. In the documentary ''The Lesser Lights of Heaven'', the band disavowed the re-recording, admitting they did it because they were broke and needed to fulfill their record contract with Solid State.\n\nWeyandt, Mellinger, Smith and a returning Cogdell set-out on the \"Burn It Down and Walk Away Tour\", billed as Zao's \"final\" tour, with support from special guests [[Underoath]], [[Unearth]], [[Dead Poetic]], and The Underwater. Although technically a tour in support of \"Parade of Chaos\" as well, no songs from the album were featured in the set-list.\n\nAfter the 2002 tour, the group's members focused on other projects, most notably Cogdell and Mellinger's more rock-oriented Jade Meridian and Horner's two-year stint with the Wheeling, West Virginia sci-fi metal band The Minus Tide.\n\n===The third era (2003\u20132006)===\n{{BLP sources section|date=January 2015}}\n[[Living Sacrifice]] drummer [[Lance Garvin]] filled in for Smith when the rest of the guys could not find him for a couple of 2003 festival dates. However, the ''Liberate'' era lineup reconvened in Greensburg around the promise of a new record label that offered to fund a new Zao album. The label ended up falling apart before a note of music was ever recorded, prompting Smith to reach out to [[Ferret Music]] who agreed to sign the band to a two-album deal. After cutting some new demos, Weyandt left the group.\n\n[[Society's Finest]] singer [[Joshua Ashworth]] was asked by Smith to join the group.<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/> This version of Zao did a few shows and recorded a couple of songs. However, by the end of 2003, Cogdell and Mellinger realized they did not want to make a Zao record without Dan on vocals. Smith & Horner quit Zao and joined up with former bassist Kevin Moran to focus on their new band, Gods. Ashworth stepped aside. With Weyandt back on board, the remaining three \"core\" members recruited the rhythm section from Jade Meridian (bass player Shawn Koschick, drummer Stephen Peck) to round-out the Zao lineup. At this time the band started to write their 7th album.<ref>{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.hmmagazine.com/issue/issue_108/the_return_of_zao.php |date=* |title=The Return of Zao }} [[HM Magazine]]. 2004. Retrieved on October 30, 2016</ref>\n\nIn 2004 Zao released ''[[The Funeral of God]]'' \u2014 a concept album that imagined a world where God had chosen to abandon mankind. Ferret heavily advertised the album, the group made their first music video (for \"The Rising End\"), and went on several tours of the US, resulting in the biggest selling Zao album to date. Though they had played a few shows there before, Zao did their first ever extensive European headlining tour with this lineup.\n\nShawn told the band he would be leaving just before the \"Praise the War Machine\" US headlining tour, but he did complete the tour. The sold-out show at Glasshouse in Pomona, CA was filmed for the band's in-the-works DVD.\n\nLongtime friend and tour manager Marty Lunn took over the bass position before Zao co-headlined the \"City of Champions\" tour with The Juliana Theory. The following year, Stephen Peck told the band he was quitting two weeks before they were set to leave for the UK to tour with [[Bleeding Through]]. Scrambling to find a replacement, the group hired local drummer Jeff Gretz, the first outwardly and outspokenly non-Christian member in the history of the band. The UK tour was followed by the \"Strhess Tour\" across the US in the summer of 2005 with Bleeding Through, [[Darkest Hour (band)|Darkest Hour]] and [[Misery Signals]]. The Los Angeles and San Diego shows were recorded for the upcoming DVD.\n\nIn 2005, the band released their DVD, ''The Lesser Lights of Heaven'', mapping their history up till that point, having members from different bands, including: [[Don Clark (musician)|Don]] and [[Ryan Clark (musician)|Ryan Clark]] ([[Demon Hunter]], [[Training for Utopia]]), [[Bruce Fitzhugh]] ([[Living Sacrifice]]), Chris McLane ([[Stretch Arm Strong]]), [[Jimmy Ryan (vocalist)|Jimmy Ryan]] ([[Haste the Day]], [[Trenches (band)|Trenches]]), and CJ Anderson ([[Sinai Beach]]).\n\nIn January 2006, Weyandt, Mellinger, Lunn & Gretz traveled to Chicago to record their next album with one of their collective heroes, [[Steve Albini]]. The making of ''[[The Fear Is What Keeps Us Here]]'' was documented for a limited edition DVD.\n\nDirectly after recording, Zao hit the road with [[In Flames]], [[Trivium (band)|Trivium]] and [[DevilDriver]]. After that, they co-headlined their second \"Ferret Music Tour\". However, they were forced to head home early after Dan severely injured his hand. ''The Fear...'' was released in June while Zao was on tour with [[Demon Hunter]]. The band filmed a video for \"My Love, My Love (We've Come Back from the Dead)\", a self-described \"zombie love story\", during that tour.\n\nThe fall of 2006 saw Zao touring with [[Throwdown (band)|Throwdown]], [[Evergreen Terrace]] and [[Maylene and the Sons of Disaster]]. During the tour, Mellinger and Weyandt both agreed that Zao should embark on a long break after the tour. Eager to continue touring, Gretz left Zao not long after and became the drummer for [[From Autumn to Ashes]].<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/>\n\n===The fourth era (2007\u20132009)===\nOn January 23, 2007, Zao announced in a lengthy statement that Russ Cogdell had rejoined the band after recovering from his knee surgery. Zao stated that they would not fill the drum position. Josh Walters, former drummer for Juliana Theory, would fill-in if/when the band next appeared live.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} The band said they had completed their two-album deal with Ferret Music but did not say who would be releasing their next album.

Zao said the best thing to come out of it is that they learned a lot of the last release and it showed them that fans still enjoy their music and this inspired and motivated them to continue making music.

Both Cogdell and Weyandt had played in Christian hardcore band [[Seasons in the Field]], who had released a split EP with Pensive.<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/> Smith would drive several hours to Greensburg, where all these new members lived, to co-write and rehearse what would become the first (and in many ways, defining) album from the new Zao, ''[[Where Blood and Fire Bring Rest]]''. The group played fewer and fewer songs from the old version of the band as ''Blood and Fire'' took hold. They toured without a bassist and set stages ablaze with their raw emotion and Weyandt's personal storytelling, which detailed the hardships that informed their songs. With a rockabilly look and Smith's oddly engaging habit of setting up his drums facing away from the audience, their live reputation grew large in the underground. Not long after recording their half of a split EP with labelmates [[Training for Utopia]] in California, Detar left the group in 1999 to focus his energy on his [[rock music|rock]] side-project [[The Juliana Theory]], who would sign to Sony and have a successful career before disbanding in 2006.<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/>\n\nScott Mellinger (formerly of [[Creation Is Crucifixion]]) joined the band on lead guitar, and Rob Horner came in on bass, before the recording of another landmark [[metalcore]] album, ''[[Liberate Te Ex Inferis]]'' (Latin for \"Save Yourself from Hell\", a line from the movie ''[[Event Horizon (film)|Event Horizon]]''). Cogdell left the band in 2000 to go to film school.\n\nMellinger, Horner and Smith wrote and recorded all of the music for Zao's fifth album titled ''[[(Self-Titled)]]'', with Dan coming by for a few days to contribute his lyrics and vocals. The album is notable for Smith's dark pop interludes, the [[Roland V-Drums|V-Drum]] sound and the song \"Five Year Winter\", which remains a signature Zao song.\n\nCorey Darst replaced Weyandt for the majority of the touring in support of the album, with Horner returning, and second guitarist Matt Auxier joining up. Darst never appeared on a Zao album although this version of the group (Darst, Smith, Mellinger and Horner) did cut a three-song demo during a Seattle tour stop. The group talked about signing with either [[Sanctuary Records|Sanctuary]] or [[Century Media Records]], but Zao \"broke up\" on stage at a December 2001 show in Pittsburgh (later documented on their DVD). They were to embark on a tour with The Juliana Theory and Weyandt had joined Darst onstage as a special guest, but an incapacitated Jesse Smith couldn't make it through the show and long-brewing tensions boiled over.\n\nSolid State / Tooth & Nail funded the next Zao projects: a brand new album that featured just Smith, Mellinger and Weyandt (Horner did not return) called ''[[Parade of Chaos]]'', as well as a re-recording of the original Zao's ''[[All Else Failed (2003 album)|All Else Failed]]'' played by the same trio. In the documentary ''The Lesser Lights of Heaven'', the band disavowed the re-recording, admitting they did it because they were broke and needed to fulfill their record contract with Solid State.\n\nWeyandt, Mellinger, Smith and a returning Cogdell set-out on the \"Burn It Down and Walk Away Tour\", billed as Zao's \"final\" tour, with support from special guests [[Underoath]], [[Unearth]], [[Dead Poetic]], and The Underwater. Although technically a tour in support of \"Parade of Chaos\" as well, no songs from the album were featured in the set-list.\n\nAfter the 2002 tour, the group's members focused on other projects, most notably Cogdell and Mellinger's more rock-oriented Jade Meridian and Horner's two-year stint with the Wheeling, West Virginia sci-fi metal band The Minus Tide.\n\n===The third era (2003\u20132006)===\n{{BLP sources section|date=January 2015}}\n[[Living Sacrifice]] drummer [[Lance Garvin]] filled in for Smith when the rest of the guys could not find him for a couple of 2003 festival dates. However, the ''Liberate'' era lineup reconvened in Greensburg around the promise of a new record label that offered to fund a new Zao album. The label ended up falling apart before a note of music was ever recorded, prompting Smith to reach out to [[Ferret Music]] who agreed to sign the band to a two-album deal. After cutting some new demos, Weyandt left the group.\n\n[[Society's Finest]] singer [[Joshua Ashworth]] was asked by Smith to join the group.<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/> This version of Zao did a few shows and recorded a couple of songs. However, by the end of 2003, Cogdell and Mellinger realized they did not want to make a Zao record without Dan on vocals. Smith & Horner quit Zao and joined up with former bassist Kevin Moran to focus on their new band, Gods. Ashworth stepped aside. With Weyandt back on board, the remaining three \"core\" members recruited the rhythm section from Jade Meridian (bass player Shawn Koschick, drummer Stephen Peck) to round-out the Zao lineup. At this time the band started to write their 7th album.<ref>{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.hmmagazine.com/issue/issue_108/the_return_of_zao.php |date=* |title=The Return of Zao }} [[HM Magazine]]. 2004. Retrieved on October 30, 2016</ref>\n\nIn 2004 Zao released ''[[The Funeral of God]]'' \u2014 a concept album that imagined a world where God had chosen to abandon mankind. Ferret heavily advertised the album, the group made their first music video (for \"The Rising End\"), and went on several tours of the US, resulting in the biggest selling Zao album to date. Though they had played a few shows there before, Zao did their first ever extensive European headlining tour with this lineup.\n\nShawn told the band he would be leaving just before the \"Praise the War Machine\" US headlining tour, but he did complete the tour. The sold-out show at Glasshouse in Pomona, CA was filmed for the band's in-the-works DVD.\n\nLongtime friend and tour manager Marty Lunn took over the bass position before Zao co-headlined the \"City of Champions\" tour with The Juliana Theory. The following year, Stephen Peck told the band he was quitting two weeks before they were set to leave for the UK to tour with [[Bleeding Through]]. Scrambling to find a replacement, the group hired local drummer Jeff Gretz, the first outwardly and outspokenly non-Christian member in the history of the band. The UK tour was followed by the \"Strhess Tour\" across the US in the summer of 2005 with Bleeding Through, [[Darkest Hour (band)|Darkest Hour]] and [[Misery Signals]]. The Los Angeles and San Diego shows were recorded for the upcoming DVD.\n\nIn 2005, the band released their DVD, ''The Lesser Lights of Heaven'', mapping their history up till that point, having members from different bands, including: [[Don Clark (musician)|Don]] and [[Ryan Clark (musician)|Ryan Clark]] ([[Demon Hunter]], [[Training for Utopia]]), [[Bruce Fitzhugh]] ([[Living Sacrifice]]), Chris McLane ([[Stretch Arm Strong]]), [[Jimmy Ryan (vocalist)|Jimmy Ryan]] ([[Haste the Day]], [[Trenches (band)|Trenches]]), and CJ Anderson ([[Sinai Beach]]).\n\nIn January 2006, Weyandt, Mellinger, Lunn & Gretz traveled to Chicago to record their next album with one of their collective heroes, [[Steve Albini]]. The making of ''[[The Fear Is What Keeps Us Here]]'' was documented for a limited edition DVD.\n\nDirectly after recording, Zao hit the road with [[In Flames]], [[Trivium (band)|Trivium]] and [[DevilDriver]]. After that, they co-headlined their second \"Ferret Music Tour\". However, they were forced to head home early after Dan severely injured his hand. ''The Fear...'' was released in June while Zao was on tour with [[Demon Hunter]]. The band filmed a video for \"My Love, My Love (We've Come Back from the Dead)\", a self-described \"zombie love story\", during that tour.\n\nThe fall of 2006 saw Zao touring with [[Throwdown (band)|Throwdown]], [[Evergreen Terrace]] and [[Maylene and the Sons of Disaster]]. During the tour, Mellinger and Weyandt both agreed that Zao should embark on a long break after the tour. Eager to continue touring, Gretz left Zao not long after and became the drummer for [[From Autumn to Ashes]].<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/>\n\n===The fourth era (2007\u20132009)===\nOn January 23, 2007, Zao announced in a lengthy statement that Russ Cogdell had rejoined the band after recovering from his knee surgery. Zao stated that they would not fill the drum position. Josh Walters, former drummer for Juliana Theory, would fill-in if/when the band next appeared live.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} The band said they had completed their two-album deal with Ferret Music but did not say who would be releasing their next album.

Zao said the best thing to come out of it is that they learned a lot of the last release and it showed them that fans still enjoy their music and this inspired and motivated them to continue making music. According to social media reports, on July 11, 2014, Zao went into the studio, after a five-year unofficial hiatus and working on side projects like Lonely Ghost Parade and Young Fox, is currently, tracking and recording their 11th album.
