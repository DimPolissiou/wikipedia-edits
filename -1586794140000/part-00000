It stars [[Tamsin Greig]] as Alice Chenery (a role written especially for her) and [[Michael Landes]] as Gil Raymond (Series 1 only). The series is written by [[David Renwick]], directed by [[Christine Gernon]] and was produced by [[Verity Lambert]]. This was the last programme that Lambert produced before she died. The programme was initially a critical success although its audience figures were steady rather than spectacular, netting an average of five million viewers an episode. Renwick and his former scriptwriting partner [[Andrew Marshall (writer)|Andrew Marshall]] have cameo appearances in one episode as members of a television sitcom scriptwriting team.\n\nThe second series started on 1 March 2008 and finished on 17 May 2008. This series contained changes from the first, including a switch from six 60-minute episodes, to twelve of 30 minutes (i.e. nominally the same total of six hours). Although the character of Gil was mentioned throughout the second series, and momentarily seen in the final episode (using a clip of Michael Landes from the previous series), he was not a main character.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/proginfo/tv/wk10/unplaced.shtml#unplaced_lovesoup |title=Love Soup |publisher=BBC Press Office |accessdate=20 February 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218012004/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/proginfo/tv/wk10/unplaced.shtml |archivedate=18 February 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe theme tune to ''Love Soup'' is \"Alley Boogie\" by [[jazz]] singer [[Georgia White]].\n\nThe first series was released on DVD in the UK on 3 December 2007.\nThe second series (and a boxset containing both series) was released on 10 May 2008.\n\n==Situation==\n'''Alice Chenery''' ([[Tamsin Greig]]) and '''Gil Raymond''' ([[Michael Landes]]) are perfect for each other. They like the same things, respect the same things, and share the same beliefs. The only problem is that they are completely unaware of each other's existence.\n\nAlice is a modern woman with old-fashioned values, who lives in [[Brighton]], and [[commuting|commutes]] to London, where she is the manager of a perfume company concession in a department store. She is trying to sell her flat and move, without success. Her love life is no success either. She can never find the perfect man. What is worse, her colleagues, '''Cleo Martin''' ([[Sheridan Smith]]) and '''Milly Russel''' ([[Montserrat Lombard]]), always seem to have more success with men, though their relationships never really last more than a week. Cleo and Milly try to pair her up with several men, but to no avail. She does have some family members (at least one cousin), but her parents, Arthur and Grace, are both dead.\n\nGil is an American comedy writer, who has moved to England to start a new project with TV producer '''Lloyd Drewitt''' ([[Owen Brenman]]). It is a series of six romantic comedies called ''Love Soup'' and he has been asked to write one of them. Things started badly for Gil when he arrived at his house (15 Carpenters Lane, Larch End), and discovered his girlfriend was seeing another man as soon as they arrived in the country. His next door neighbours are '''Bob and Irene Andrews''' ([[Brian Protheroe]] and [[Trudie Styler]]), who split up after Gil accidentally exposes Bob's affair with a prostitute. Afterwards, Gil becomes increasingly worried about Irene's intentions towards him.\n\nThe series follows both Alice and Gil's somewhat forlorn attempts to find the perfect partner, while it is clear to the viewer that they would be the ideal couple. The series itself follows each plot separately, cutting from Alice's story to Gil's throughout the episode. The only exception is the final scene of the first series, which shows Alice in the theatre watching a comedy where she is the only person in the entire audience not laughing \u2013 apart from Gil, who is sitting two rows behind her. They still do not find each other.\n\nIn the third episode of the second series, Alice arranges a date through a personal ad in a magazine. When he fails to turn up she returns home and rips up his photograph. She receives a phone call from Lloyd, telling her that his friend could not make the date. The reason is not stated on screen, but Alice, clearly shaken, picks up the torn photograph and reassembles it, it is a photo of Gil. The next episode, it is revealed that Gil died of a heart attack. In the seventh episode of the series, Alice is invited into Gil's world via Lloyd, where she begins a relationship with a writer, '''Douglas McVitie''' ([[Mark Heap]]). After a while she feels that there is little love in the relationship so she tries to break it up; Douglas, however, is determined to stay with her. Alice also moves in with '''Fae Maddison''' ([[Amelia Curtis]]), a famous actress she meets after a date goes horribly wrong.\n\n==Episodes==\n\n===Series 1===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #cccccc;\" | #\n! style=\"background: #cccccc;\" | Title\n! style=\"background: #cccccc;\" | Written by\n! style=\"background: #cccccc;\" | Duration (mins)\n|-\n|<center>1</center>\n|<center>There Must Be Some Way Out of Here</center>\n|<center>[[David Renwick]]</center>\n|<center>60</center>\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"6\"| Alice becomes worried about her security after she discovers her estate agent has been doing her washing in her flat.

She later visits Gil's house and rests on the gate like Gil did in series 1. As she does this, Gil appears resting on the gate, she looks his way, doesn't see him, looks back to the house and he disappears.\n\n==Reception==\nViews of ''Love Soup'' are mixed. Andrew Billen in ''[[The Times]]'' said that, \"Like David Renwick's previous sitcom creation, [[Victor Meldrew]] [from ''[[One Foot in the Grave]]''], Alice is meant to represent a bunch of prevailing attitudes. In fact, like him, she is entirely implausible. Happily, this fundamental error makes her no less funny.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Billen|first=Andrew|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article3462716.ece?openComment=true|title=Mad Men; Love Soup: Weekend TV|work=The Times|date=3 March 2008|accessdate=3 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nJames Walton in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' commented negatively about the loss of Landes saying, \"In the first series Gil's job as a TV scriptwriter meant that Renwick could always add a bit of edge by attacking modern television. Without that, and with Alice remaining so utterly lovely, the tone is often surprisingly soppy.\" The basis for this was subsequently rendered redundant as Alice began to move in media circles via her association with Lloyd, Douglas and Fae. Walton also wrote however that, \"Renwick does his usual professional job with the script, and Greig is as good as ever at registering various shades of disappointment.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Walton|first=James|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/03/03/nosplit/bvtv03last.xml|title=Weekend on television: Mad Men (BBC4, Sun) \u2013 Love Soup (BBC1, Sat) |work=The Daily Telegraph|date=3 March 2008|accessdate=3 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nSam Wollaston in ''[[The Guardian]]'' was critical of ''Love Soup'' writing, \"I don't like the fact that so little happens. Or how implausible the few things that do happen are. I know it's meant to be comedy, not a reflection of real life; but it helps if comedy can keep a toe in plausibility (unless it's so crazy, like ''[[Green Wing]]'', that it's funny for that very reason). But Milly falling in love with a shadow \u2013 actually more like a projection of a man on to the side of a van that miraculously happens outside her flat every night \u2013 well, that's just stupid. And I don't like its irritating jazzy soundtrack, or how small and British it all feels (and I mean both in the worst possible way). ''Love Soup'' is insipid broth and I've had enough already.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Wollaston|first=Sam|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/mar/03/television|title=Last night's TV|work=The Guardian|date=3 March 2008|accessdate=3 March 2008}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/lovesoup/ ''Love Soup''] at [[bbc.co.uk]].\n* [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443390/ ''Love Soup''] at the [[Internet Movie Database]].\n* [http://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/tv/love_soup/ ''Love Soup''] at the [[British Comedy Guide]]\n* [http://www.phill.co.uk/comedy/lovesoup/index.html ''Love Soup''] at British TV Comedy.\n* [https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/2005_39_wed_02.shtml Woman's Hour] interview, 28 September 2005.\n\n[[Category:2005 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2008 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:2000s British romance television series]]\n[[Category:British comedy-drama television programmes]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=November 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2017}}\n{{Infobox television\n|show_name = Love Soup\n|image =<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Love Soup.jpg|200px]] -->\n|caption = ''Love Soup'' intertitle\n|genre = [[Romantic comedy|Romantic]] [[comedy drama]]\n|writer = [[David Renwick]]\n|starring = [[Tamsin Greig]]<br />[[Sheridan Smith]]<br />[[Montserrat Lombard]]<br />[[Owen Brenman]]<br />[[Michael Landes]] (Series 1)<br />[[Trudie Styler]] (Series 1)<br />[[Mark Heap]] (Series 2)<br />[[Amelia Curtis]] (Series 2)\n|opentheme = \"Alley Boogie\" by [[Georgia White]]\n|endtheme = Reprise\n|country = United Kingdom\n\n|num_series = 2\n|num_episodes = 18\n|list_episodes = #Episodes\n|executive_producer = David Renwick<br />[[Jon Plowman]]\n|producer = [[Verity Lambert]]\n|runtime = 60 min.

Andrew Billen in ''[[The Times]]'' said that, \"Like David Renwick's previous sitcom creation, [[Victor Meldrew]] [from ''[[One Foot in the Grave]]''], Alice is meant to represent a bunch of prevailing attitudes. In fact, like him, she is entirely implausible. Happily, this fundamental error makes her no less funny.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Billen|first=Andrew|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article3462716.ece?openComment=true|title=Mad Men; Love Soup: Weekend TV|work=The Times|date=3 March 2008|accessdate=3 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nJames Walton in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' commented negatively about the loss of Landes saying, \"In the first series Gil's job as a TV scriptwriter meant that Renwick could always add a bit of edge by attacking modern television. Without that, and with Alice remaining so utterly lovely, the tone is often surprisingly soppy.\" The basis for this was subsequently rendered redundant as Alice began to move in media circles via her association with Lloyd, Douglas and Fae. Walton also wrote however that, \"Renwick does his usual professional job with the script, and Greig is as good as ever at registering various shades of disappointment.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Walton|first=James|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/03/03/nosplit/bvtv03last.xml|title=Weekend on television: Mad Men (BBC4, Sun) \u2013 Love Soup (BBC1, Sat) |work=The Daily Telegraph|date=3 March 2008|accessdate=3 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nSam Wollaston in ''[[The Guardian]]'' was critical of ''Love Soup'' writing, \"I don't like the fact that so little happens. Or how implausible the few things that do happen are. I know it's meant to be comedy, not a reflection of real life; but it helps if comedy can keep a toe in plausibility (unless it's so crazy, like ''[[Green Wing]]'', that it's funny for that very reason). But Milly falling in love with a shadow \u2013 actually more like a projection of a man on to the side of a van that miraculously happens outside her flat every night \u2013 well, that's just stupid. And I don't like its irritating jazzy soundtrack, or how small and British it all feels (and I mean both in the worst possible way). ''Love Soup'' is insipid broth and I've had enough already.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Wollaston|first=Sam|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/mar/03/television|title=Last night's TV|work=The Guardian|date=3 March 2008|accessdate=3 March 2008}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/lovesoup/ ''Love Soup''] at [[bbc.co.uk]].\n* [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443390/ ''Love Soup''] at the [[Internet Movie Database]].\n* [http://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/tv/love_soup/ ''Love Soup''] at the [[British Comedy Guide]]\n* [http://www.phill.co.uk/comedy/lovesoup/index.html ''Love Soup''] at British TV Comedy.\n* [https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/2005_39_wed_02.shtml Woman's Hour] interview, 28 September 2005.\n\n[[Category:2005 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2008 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:2000s British romance television series]]\n[[Category:British comedy-drama television programmes]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n", "name_user": "213.248.112.36", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Soup"}

He was the leader of the [[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]], a [[social democratic]] and [[Quebec sovereignty movement|sovereigntist]] party in [[Quebec]].\n\nBetween January 1996 and March 2003, Boisclair served as Citizenship and Immigration Minister and Social Solidarity Minister under former [[Premier of Quebec]] [[Lucien Bouchard]] and as Environment Minister under former Premier [[Bernard Landry]].

He grew up in the affluent francophone Montreal neighbourhood of [[Outremont, Quebec|Outremont]]. While attending [[Coll\u00e8ge Jean-de-Br\u00e9beuf]], a private [[CEGEP]], he became the president of the Federation of Quebec College Students (in French, ''[[FECQ]]'').  After graduation he attended [[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al]], but dropped out after two years.\n\n==Political scene 1989\u20132003==\nHe joined the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois in 1984, and in the [[1989 Quebec general election|1989 general election]] he was elected to represent the Montreal-area [[Riding (division)|riding]] of [[Gouin (electoral district)|Gouin]] as a PQ candidate. At 23 years old, he became the youngest member ever elected to the [[National Assembly of Quebec|Quebec National Assembly]], a record he held until [[Simon-Pierre Diamond]] was elected in 2007. He also quickly garnered a reputation as a party animal in Quebec City's night-life scene.<ref>{{cite news|title=Andr\u00e9 Boisclair: the PQ's young star|publisher=CBC News|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/parti_quebecois/boisclair.html|accessdate=2007-05-08|date=2005-11-16}}</ref>\n\nHe served as a [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] [[political minister|minister]] from 1998 to 2003, under Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (PQ) Premiers Lucien Bouchard and Bernard Landry, holding a variety of high-profile portfolios. During his time in office, Boisclair and his chief of staff, Luc Doray, became the center of a drug and embezzlement scandal.

However, in September 2005, Boisclair admitted to personally using cocaine between 1996 and 2003 while serving as a member of the Quebec legislature.\n\nBoisclair continued to serve as a Member of the National Assembly until he resigned in August 2004 to attend the [[Kennedy School of Government|John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]]. At the time of his resignation, Boisclair held the position of opposition parliamentary (house) leader. Boisclair completed the Master's in Public Administration program at the John F. Kennedy School of Government - a program that does not require students to hold a previous university degree. While at Harvard, Boisclair attended lectures by [[Michael Ignatieff]] and kept a [[blog]] recording his experience.\n\n==Party leadership==\nAfter Bernard Landry resigned in June 2005, Boisclair entered the race to succeed Landry as the PQ's leader. Elected as the sixth leader of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois on November 15, 2005, Boisclair earned 53.8% of the party membership vote as compared to his closest rival, [[Pauline Marois]], who garnered 30.6%. For the first time, the PQ allowed telephone voting, resulting in the participation of over 76% of the party membership. Polls taken at the time of his leadership victory in November 2005 suggested that Boisclair's Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois would win a landslide victory over the incumbent [[Quebec Liberal Party|Liberal]] Party of [[Jean Charest]].\n\nBoisclair was the first [[Coming out|openly gay]] politician in Canada to win the leadership of a party with legislative representation. (Previous openly gay Canadian political party leaders included [[Chris Lea]] of the [[Green Party of Canada]] and [[Allison Brewer]] of the [[New Brunswick New Democratic Party]].)\n\nAfter his election as party leader, Boisclair delivered a speech promising a sovereignty referendum within two years of a PQ victory in the next Quebec general election. During a joint press conference with [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] leader [[Gilles Duceppe]] in Montreal on November 20, 2005, Boisclair decried Canada's [[Clarity Act]] as unacceptable. He stated that if elected Premier, he would ignore the ruling of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] on referendum question clarity.\n\nUpon taking the reins of the PQ, Boisclair's actions quickly created political controversy within his own party. After a questionable appearance in a comedy sketch featuring a homosexual depiction of [[Stephen Harper]] and [[George W. Bush]], and an attempt to distance the PQ from its traditional union base, a push to oust Boisclair developed. Purportedly led by Boisclair's predecessor, Bernard Landry (which he denies), the plan failed and no real threat to Boisclair's leadership emerged. Pundits speculated that the proximity of the Quebec general election contributed to the putsch's failure.\n\nOn August 14, 2006, Boisclair was elected to the provincial legislative assembly in a by-election for the Montreal-area riding of [[Pointe-aux-Trembles (electoral district)|Pointe-aux-Trembles]]. He was re-elected in the general election of March 26, 2007.\n\n==2007 election==\n\nIn February 2007, Boisclair promised a dream team of high-profile candidates for the anticipated [[2007 Quebec general election|2007 general election]]. Comparing his slate to the ''l'\u00e9quipe du tonnerre'' (the thunder team) of former premier and [[Quiet revolution]] architect [[Jean Lesage]], Boiscair announced that actor [[Pierre Curzi]], former cabinet member [[Linda Goupil]], TV journalist [[Bernard Drainville]], academic Guy Lachapelle, union leader Marc Laviolette, and former Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois MPs [[Richard Marceau]] and [[Yvan Loubier]] composed this team. On February 21, 2007, the Lieutenant-Governor of Quebec, [[Lise Thibault]], dissolved parliament and called a general election for March 26, 2007.\n\nBoisclair launched his campaign using the slogan \"Reconstruisons notre Qu\u00e9bec\" (Let's rebuild our Quebec). At the beginning of the campaign, Boisclair's Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois stood five percentage points behind the Quebec Liberals.\n\nBoisclair stated throughout his campaign that education would remain a key priority in the PQ's election strategy and that he would organize a new referendum on sovereignty as soon as possible.

He was the leader of the [[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]], a [[social democratic]] and [[Quebec sovereignty movement|sovereigntist]] party in [[Quebec]].\n\nBetween January 1996 and March 2003, Boisclair served as Citizenship and Immigration Minister and Social Solidarity Minister under former [[Premier of Quebec]] [[Lucien Bouchard]] and as Environment Minister under former Premier [[Bernard Landry]].

He grew up in the affluent francophone Montreal neighbourhood of [[Outremont, Quebec|Outremont]]. While attending [[Coll\u00e8ge Jean-de-Br\u00e9beuf]], a private [[CEGEP]], he became the president of the Federation of Quebec College Students (in French, ''[[FECQ]]'').  After graduation he attended [[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al]], but dropped out after two years.\n\n==Political scene 1989\u20132003==\nHe joined the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois in 1984, and in the [[1989 Quebec general election|1989 general election]] he was elected to represent the Montreal-area [[Riding (division)|riding]] of [[Gouin (electoral district)|Gouin]] as a PQ candidate. At 23 years old, he became the youngest member ever elected to the [[National Assembly of Quebec|Quebec National Assembly]], a record he held until [[Simon-Pierre Diamond]] was elected in 2007. He also quickly garnered a reputation as a party animal in Quebec City's night-life scene.<ref>{{cite news|title=Andr\u00e9 Boisclair: the PQ's young star|publisher=CBC News|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/parti_quebecois/boisclair.html|accessdate=2007-05-08|date=2005-11-16}}</ref>\n\nHe served as a [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] [[political minister|minister]] from 1998 to 2003, under Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (PQ) Premiers Lucien Bouchard and Bernard Landry, holding a variety of high-profile portfolios. During his time in office, Boisclair and his chief of staff, Luc Doray, became the center of a drug and embezzlement scandal. After a routine audit, officials discovered that Doray submitted over $30,000 in false expense reports and authorities later discovered that Doray had used the money to feed his [[cocaine]] habit.<ref name=\"globe-20051109\">{{cite news|title=Boisclair's skeletons rattle bitter PQ race|publisher=The Globe and Mail|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/boisclairs-skeletons-rattle-bitter-pq-race/article18252241/?page=all|accessdate=2015-05-28|date=2005-11-09}}</ref>\n\nDoray plead guilty to defrauding the government and during court testimony it was learned that Boisclair authorized some of the expenses.<ref name=\"globe-20051109\"/><ref>http://globeandmail.workopolis.com/servlet/Content/qprinter/20051109/BOISCLAIR09{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  The ensuing investigation cleared Boisclair of any wrongdoing - he was never accused nor charged with any crime. However, in September 2005, Boisclair admitted to personally using cocaine between 1996 and 2003 while serving as a member of the Quebec legislature.\n\nBoisclair continued to serve as a Member of the National Assembly until he resigned in August 2004 to attend the [[Kennedy School of Government|John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]]. At the time of his resignation, Boisclair held the position of opposition parliamentary (house) leader. Boisclair completed the Master's in Public Administration program at the John F. Kennedy School of Government - a program that does not require students to hold a previous university degree. While at Harvard, Boisclair attended lectures by [[Michael Ignatieff]] and kept a [[blog]] recording his experience.\n\n==Party leadership==\nAfter Bernard Landry resigned in June 2005, Boisclair entered the race to succeed Landry as the PQ's leader. Elected as the sixth leader of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois on November 15, 2005, Boisclair earned 53.8% of the party membership vote as compared to his closest rival, [[Pauline Marois]], who garnered 30.6%. For the first time, the PQ allowed telephone voting, resulting in the participation of over 76% of the party membership. Polls taken at the time of his leadership victory in November 2005 suggested that Boisclair's Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois would win a landslide victory over the incumbent [[Quebec Liberal Party|Liberal]] Party of [[Jean Charest]].\n\nBoisclair was the first [[Coming out|openly gay]] politician in Canada to win the leadership of a party with legislative representation. (Previous openly gay Canadian political party leaders included [[Chris Lea]] of the [[Green Party of Canada]] and [[Allison Brewer]] of the [[New Brunswick New Democratic Party]].)\n\nAfter his election as party leader, Boisclair delivered a speech promising a sovereignty referendum within two years of a PQ victory in the next Quebec general election. During a joint press conference with [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] leader [[Gilles Duceppe]] in Montreal on November 20, 2005, Boisclair decried Canada's [[Clarity Act]] as unacceptable. He stated that if elected Premier, he would ignore the ruling of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] on referendum question clarity.\n\nUpon taking the reins of the PQ, Boisclair's actions quickly created political controversy within his own party. After a questionable appearance in a comedy sketch featuring a homosexual depiction of [[Stephen Harper]] and [[George W. Bush]], and an attempt to distance the PQ from its traditional union base, a push to oust Boisclair developed. Purportedly led by Boisclair's predecessor, Bernard Landry (which he denies), the plan failed and no real threat to Boisclair's leadership emerged. Pundits speculated that the proximity of the Quebec general election contributed to the putsch's failure.\n\nOn August 14, 2006, Boisclair was elected to the provincial legislative assembly in a by-election for the Montreal-area riding of [[Pointe-aux-Trembles (electoral district)|Pointe-aux-Trembles]]. He was re-elected in the general election of March 26, 2007.\n\n==2007 election==\n\nIn February 2007, Boisclair promised a dream team of high-profile candidates for the anticipated [[2007 Quebec general election|2007 general election]]. Comparing his slate to the ''l'\u00e9quipe du tonnerre'' (the thunder team) of former premier and [[Quiet revolution]] architect [[Jean Lesage]], Boiscair announced that actor [[Pierre Curzi]], former cabinet member [[Linda Goupil]], TV journalist [[Bernard Drainville]], academic Guy Lachapelle, union leader Marc Laviolette, and former Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois MPs [[Richard Marceau]] and [[Yvan Loubier]] composed this team. On February 21, 2007, the Lieutenant-Governor of Quebec, [[Lise Thibault]], dissolved parliament and called a general election for March 26, 2007.\n\nBoisclair launched his campaign using the slogan \"Reconstruisons notre Qu\u00e9bec\" (Let's rebuild our Quebec). At the beginning of the campaign, Boisclair's Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois stood five percentage points behind the Quebec Liberals.\n\nBoisclair stated throughout his campaign that education would remain a key priority in the PQ's election strategy and that he would organize a new referendum on sovereignty as soon as possible.  He also supported new measures targeting home ownership for young families.\n\nDuring the election campaign, controversy arose when radio talk show host [[Louis Champagne]] made [[Homophobia|homophobic]] remarks while interviewing Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois candidate [[Alexandre Cloutier]], asking him if the fact that his party was led by a gay man \u2014 and was running an openly gay candidate, [[Sylvain Gaudreault]], in the neighbouring riding to Cloutier's \u2014 meant that voters would believe the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois was \"a club of fags\".<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/boisclair-responds-to-homophobic-slurs-1.689183 \"Boisclair responds to homophobic slurs\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005111539/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/boisclair-responds-to-homophobic-slurs-1.689183 |date=October 5, 2016 }}, [[cbc.ca]], March 1, 2007.</ref> Days later, the radio station's corporate owner, the [[Corus Group]], suspended Champagne.\n\nMost observers ruled the 2007 leaders' debate a draw.

In discussion with colleagues, Kushnick considered donating the material to the [[University of Manchester Library]], but decided he would like it to be readily available to people outside the University as well as to students and researchers,  envisaging a collection that would \u2018have huge research value, but also be instrumental in celebrating cultures and combating racism.\u2019 <ref name=\"manchester1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.racearchive.manchester.ac.uk/about/ |title=About (The University of Manchester) |website=Racearchive.manchester.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-05-29}}</ref>  He approached Professor [[Martin Harris (academic)|Martin Harris]], then Vice-Chancellor of the University of Manchester, who agreed to provide rent-free space to support the initiative.<ref name=\"wordpress1\">{{cite web|last=Irving |first=Sarah |url=http://radicalmanchester.wordpress.com/2011/08/08/the-ahmed-iqbal-ullah-race-relations-centre/ |title=The Ahmed Iqbal Ullah Race Relations Centre \u2013 Manchester's Radical History [|website=Radicalmanchester.wordpress.com |date=2011-08-08 |accessdate=2017-05-29}}</ref>\nThe Centre was established (as the Ahmed Iqbal Ullah Race Relations Archive) in 1999, with Lou Kushnick as its first Director.<ref name=\"manchester1\"/>\nInitially based on the university campus, the Centre had a number of homes, including at the University of Manchester's [[Sackville Street Building]].

In discussion with colleagues, Kushnick considered donating the material to the [[University of Manchester Library]], but decided he would like it to be readily available to people outside the University as well as to students and researchers,  envisaging a collection that would \u2018have huge research value, but also be instrumental in celebrating cultures and combating racism.\u2019 <ref name=\"manchester1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.racearchive.manchester.ac.uk/about/ |title=About (The University of Manchester) |website=Racearchive.manchester.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-05-29}}</ref>  He approached Professor [[Martin Harris (academic)|Martin Harris]], then Vice-Chancellor of the University of Manchester, who agreed to provide rent-free space to support the initiative.<ref name=\"wordpress1\">{{cite web|last=Irving |first=Sarah |url=http://radicalmanchester.wordpress.com/2011/08/08/the-ahmed-iqbal-ullah-race-relations-centre/ |title=The Ahmed Iqbal Ullah Race Relations Centre \u2013 Manchester's Radical History [|website=Radicalmanchester.wordpress.com |date=2011-08-08 |accessdate=2017-05-29}}</ref>\nThe Centre was established (as the Ahmed Iqbal Ullah Race Relations Archive) in 1999, with Lou Kushnick as its first Director.<ref name=\"manchester1\"/>\nInitially based on the university campus, the Centre had a number of homes, including at the University of Manchester's [[Sackville Street Building]].

It was created in 2001 and is a registered charity governed by a board of trustees. It functions as the outreach arm of the Centre and delivers a wide range of activities and projects that include:\n\n* supporting heritage projects to identify, collect and archive the histories of BAME communities in the region;\n* activities across schools to promote knowledge and understanding of black history, citizenship and multicultural issues;\n* events and exhibitions that promote knowledge and understanding of black history.\n\nThe AIUET receives funding from Manchester City Council and the University of Manchester. The funding is governed by a collaboration agreement between the three parties. AIUET has also been successful in securing [[National Lottery Heritage Fund]] (NLHF) grants for community heritage projects. These include:\n\n* '''Yemeni Roots Salford Lives''' (2010-2012). A project exploring the history of one of Greater Manchester's oldest communities.\n*'''Legacy of Ahmed''' (2015-2016). A project exploring the impact of Ahmed's murder, 30 years on.

The key to understanding DBT is analogous to understanding the difference between an x-ray and CT.  Specifically, one is three dimensional whereas the other is flat. A mammogram usually takes two x-rays of each breast from different angles whereas digital tomosynthesis creates a 3-dimensional picture of the breast using x-rays.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/testing/types/dig_tomosynth|title=Digital Tomosynthesis|date=2016-06-23|website=Breastcancer.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nIn DBT, like conventional mammography, compression is used to improve image quality and decreases radiation dose.

The active elements in transducers are composed of ceramic crystal materials called piezoelectrics which produce sound waves when an electric field is applied to them, or work in the reverse producing an electric field when a sound wave hits them. Likewise, an ultrasound scanner generates two-dimension images of tissues and organs by using the speed of sound and time of each echo\u2019s return to calculate the distance from the transducer to the tissue boundary (ex: the\u00a0 boundary between fluid and soft tissue).\n\nUltrasound can be considered either a [[diagnostic procedure|diagnostic]] or a [[screening (medicine)|screening]] procedure.<ref name=\"StavrosRapp2004\">{{cite book|author1=A.

Ultrasound probes, called transducers, operate at sound waves much higher than the threshold of human hearing. Most diagnostic ultrasound probes are placed on the skin but they can also be placed inside anatomical tracts to optimize image quality. Ultrasound can also be used in breast surgery if the probe is covered with a plastic wrap and made to be sterile. \n\nIt is helpful to subcategorize diagnostic ultrasound as anatomic and functional ultrasound. Anatomic ultrasound is used to image internal organs whereas functional ultrasound creates information maps by combining information such as movement & velocity of blood, softness of tissue, or other physical characteristics.

The active elements in transducers are composed of ceramic crystal materials called piezoelectrics which produce sound waves when an electric field is applied to them, or work in the reverse producing an electric field when a sound wave hits them. Likewise, an ultrasound scanner generates two-dimension images of tissues and organs by using the speed of sound and time of each echo\u2019s return to calculate the distance from the transducer to the tissue boundary (ex: the\u00a0 boundary between fluid and soft tissue).\n\nUltrasound can be considered either a [[diagnostic procedure|diagnostic]] or a [[screening (medicine)|screening]] procedure.<ref name=\"StavrosRapp2004\">{{cite book|author1=A.

Ultrasound probes, called transducers, operate at sound waves much higher than the threshold of human hearing. Most diagnostic ultrasound probes are placed on the skin but they can also be placed inside anatomical tracts to optimize image quality. Ultrasound can also be used in breast surgery if the probe is covered with a plastic wrap and made to be sterile. \n\nIt is helpful to subcategorize diagnostic ultrasound as anatomic and functional ultrasound. Anatomic ultrasound is used to image internal organs whereas functional ultrasound creates information maps by combining information such as movement & velocity of blood, softness of tissue, or other physical characteristics. Another functional form of ultrasound is elastography which measures and displays the relative stiffness of tissues, which is used to differentiate tumors from healthy tissue. Ultrasound also plays a functional role in imaging interventions for the body. Specifically, ultrasound-guided needle biopsy allows providers to see the needle while it is being guided to a target, such as a mass or tumor in the breast. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nibib.nih.gov/science-education/science-topics/ultrasound|title=Ultrasound|website=www.nibib.nih.gov|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>Through this use, it has also shown to decrease re-excision and mastectomy rates in breast cancer.

Its purpose is to interface with tissues that may be modified or destroyed. It does this by producing very high intensity beams that can destroy diseased or abnormal tissues like tumors. \n\nContrast-enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) Imaging has also been researched in relation to mammography and shows similar sensitivity to MRI in detecting breast cancer across lesions of similar size.

The crew consisted of five [[NASA]] [[astronaut]]s, one [[payload specialist]], and a civilian schoolteacher. The mission carried the designation [[STS-51-L]] and was the tenth flight for the ''Challenger'' [[Space Shuttle orbiter|orbiter]]. \n\nThe spacecraft disintegrated over the [[Atlantic Ocean]], off the coast of [[Cape Canaveral, Florida|Cape Canaveral]], [[Florida]], at 11:39{{nbsp}}a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] (16:39 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). The disintegration of the vehicle began after a joint in its right [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket booster]] (SRB) failed at liftoff. The failure was caused by the failure of [[O-ring]] seals used in the joint that were not designed to handle the unusually cold conditions that existed at this launch. The seals' failure caused a breach in the SRB joint, allowing pressurized burning gas from within the solid rocket motor to reach the outside and impinge upon the adjacent SRB aft field joint attachment hardware and [[Space Shuttle external tank|external fuel tank]]. This led to the separation of the right-hand SRB's aft field joint attachment and the [[Structural integrity and failure|structural failure]] of the external tank. [[Aerodynamic]] forces broke up the orbiter.\n\nThe crew compartment and many other vehicle fragments were eventually recovered from the ocean floor after a lengthy search and recovery operation. The exact timing of the death of the crew is unknown; several crew members are known to have survived the initial breakup of the spacecraft. The shuttle had no escape system,{{efn|name=\"n1\"|The first two Space Shuttle orbiters, ''Enterprise'' and ''Columbia'', originally had [[Space Shuttle abort modes#Ejection seat|ejection seats]] installed in the flight deck for the pilot and co-pilot in the initial test missions.

The pilot's ejection seats were disabled after [[STS-4]] and subsequently removed by the launch of [[STS-61]] on January 12, 1986, and were never installed on the remaining four orbiters.}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Shuttle Carrying New Escape System|publisher=Associated Press|access-date=October 23, 2016|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1988/Shuttle-Carrying-New-Escape-System/id-50c3be84147652b242204463a5b036d5|date=September 27, 1988|last1=Tolley|first1=Laura}}</ref> and the impact of the crew compartment at [[terminal velocity]] with the ocean surface was too violent to be survivable.<ref>{{cite news|last=Abramson |first=Rudy |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=April 8, 1988 |title=Shuttle to Have Device Enabling Crew to Escape |quote=Studies in the wake of the Challenger disaster showed that astronauts probably would not survive an ocean ditching{{nbsp}}...

The Rogers Commission found NASA's [[organizational culture]] and decision-making processes had been key contributing factors to the accident,<ref>{{cite web | author=Outer Space Universe| title=Remembering the Challenger Shuttle Explosion: A Disaster 25 Years Ago | url=http://www.outerspaceuniverse.org/remembering-challenger-shuttle-explosion-25-years.html | accessdate=January 28, 2011}}</ref> with the agency violating its own safety rules. NASA managers had known since 1977 that contractor [[Thiokol|Morton-Thiokol]]'s design of the SRBs contained a potentially catastrophic flaw in the O-rings, but they had failed to address this problem properly. NASA managers also disregarded warnings from engineers about the dangers of launching posed by the low temperatures of that morning, and failed to adequately report these technical concerns to their superiors.\n\nApproximately 17 percent of the American population witnessed the launch on live television broadcast because of the presence of high school teacher [[Christa McAuliffe]], who would have been the first [[Teacher in Space Project|teacher in space]]. Media coverage of the accident was extensive; one study reported that 85&nbsp;percent of Americans surveyed had heard the news within an hour of the accident.<ref>{{cite web|title=On January 28, 1986, Space Shuttle Challenger Exploded 76 Seconds After Launch (Video) |url=http://www.viralvideobox.com/on-january-28-1986-space-shuttle-challenger-exploded-76-seconds-after-launch-video/|work=Viral Video Box|accessdate=January 28, 2014}}</ref> The ''Challenger'' disaster has been used as a case study in many discussions of engineering safety and workplace ethics.\n\n==O-ring concerns==\n[[File:STS-51-L - Space Shuttle Challenger on the Crawler-Transporter.jpg|thumb|''Challenger'' being carried atop a [[Crawler-transporter]] on the way to the launch pad]]\n\nEach of the Space Shuttle's two Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) was constructed of seven sections, six of which were permanently joined in pairs at the factory. For each flight, the four resulting segments were then assembled in the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] at [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC), with three field joints. The factory joints were sealed with asbestos-silica insulation applied over the joint, while each field joint was sealed with two rubber O-rings. After the destruction of ''Challenger'', the number of O-rings per field joint was increased to three.<ref>{{cite web|title=Solid Rocket Motor Joint Reliability|url=http://engineer.jpl.nasa.gov/practices/1257.pdf|publisher=NASA Engineering}}</ref> The seals of all of the SRB joints were required to contain the hot, high-pressure gases produced by the burning solid propellant inside, thus forcing them out of the nozzle at the aft end of each rocket.\n\nDuring the [[Space Shuttle design process]], a [[McDonnell Douglas]] report in September 1971 discussed the safety record of solid rockets. While a safe abort was possible after most types of failures, one was especially dangerous: a burnthrough by hot gases of the rocket's casing. The report stated that \"if burnthrough occurs adjacent to [liquid hydrogen/oxygen] tank or orbiter, timely sensing may not be feasible and abort not possible\", accurately foreshadowing the ''Challenger'' accident.<ref name=\"heppenheimer1998\">{{cite book | title=The Space Shuttle Decision | publisher=NASA publication SP-4221 | author=Heppenheimer, T.

As originally designed by Thiokol, the O-ring joints in the SRBs were supposed to close more tightly due to forces generated at ignition, but a 1977 test showed that when pressurized water was used to simulate the effects of booster combustion, the metal parts bent away from each other, opening a gap through which gases could leak. This phenomenon, known as \"joint rotation\", caused a momentary drop in air pressure. This made it possible for combustion gases to erode the O-rings. In the event of widespread erosion, a flame path could develop, causing the joint to burst\u2014which would have destroyed the booster and the shuttle.<ref name=\"Major Malfunction\">{{cite book | last=McConnell | first=Malcolm | date=1987 | title=Challenger: A Major Malfunction | location=Garden City, NY | publisher=Doubleday | isbn=978-0-385-23877-9 | url=https://archive.org/details/challengermajorm00mcco }}</ref>{{rp|118}}\n\nEngineers at the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] wrote to the manager of the Solid Rocket Booster project, George Hardy, on several occasions suggesting that Thiokol's field joint design was unacceptable. For example, one engineer suggested that joint rotation would render the secondary O-ring useless, but Hardy did not forward these memos to Thiokol, and the field joints were accepted for flight in 1980.<ref name=\"Rogers_vol6\">{{cite web |author=Rogers Commission |title=Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident, Chapter VI: An Accident Rooted in History |date=June 6, 1986 |url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch6.htm }}</ref>\n\nEvidence of serious O-ring erosion was present as early as the second space shuttle mission, [[STS-2]], which was flown by ''Columbia''. Contrary to NASA regulations, the Marshall Center did not report this problem to senior management at NASA, but opted to keep the problem within their reporting channels with Thiokol. Even after the O-rings were redesignated as \"Criticality 1\" \u2014 meaning that their failure would result in the destruction of the Orbiter, no one at Marshall suggested that the shuttles be grounded until the flaw could be fixed.<ref name=\"Rogers_vol6\" />\n\nAfter the 1984 launch of [[STS-41-D]], flown by ''Discovery'', the first occurrence of hot gas \"blow-by\" was discovered beyond the primary O-ring. In the post-flight analysis, [[Thiokol]] engineers found that the amount of blow-by was relatively small and had not impinged upon the secondary O-ring, and concluded that for future flights, the damage was an acceptable risk. However, after the ''Challenger'' disaster, [[Thiokol]] engineer Brian Russell identified this event as the first \"big red flag\" regarding O-ring safety.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vaughan|first=Diane|title=The Challenger launch decision: risky technology, culture, and deviance at NASA|year=1996|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-85175-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/challengerlaunch00dian/page/143 143]\u201344|url=https://archive.org/details/challengerlaunch00dian|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nBy 1985, with seven of nine shuttle launches that year using boosters displaying O-ring erosion or hot gas blow-by,<ref>{{cite book|last=Vaughan|first=Diane|title=The Challenger launch decision: risky technology, culture, and deviance at NASA|year=1996|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-85175-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/challengerlaunch00dian/page/153 153]|url=https://archive.org/details/challengerlaunch00dian|url-access=registration}}</ref> Marshall and Thiokol realized that they had a potentially catastrophic problem on their hands. Perhaps most concerning was the launch of [[STS-51-B]] in April 1985, flown by ''Challenger'', in which the worst O-ring damage to date was discovered in post-flight analysis. The primary O-ring of the left nozzle had been eroded so extensively that it had failed to seal, and for the first time hot gases had eroded the secondary O-ring.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vaughan|first=Diane|title=The Challenger launch decision: risky technology, culture, and deviance at NASA|year=1996|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-85175-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/challengerlaunch00dian/page/162 162]|url=https://archive.org/details/challengerlaunch00dian|url-access=registration}}</ref> They began the process of redesigning the joint with three inches (76&nbsp;mm) of additional steel around the tang. This tang would grip the inner face of the joint and prevent it from rotating. They did not call for a halt to shuttle flights until the joints could be redesigned, but rather treated the problem as an acceptable flight risk. For example, Lawrence Mulloy, Marshall's manager for the SRB project since 1982, issued and waived launch constraints for six consecutive flights. Thiokol even went as far as to persuade NASA to declare the O-ring problem \"closed\".<ref name=\"Rogers_vol6\" /> [[Donald J. Kutyna|Donald Kutyna]], a member of the [[Rogers Commission]], later likened this situation to an airline permitting one of its planes to continue to fly despite evidence that one of its wings was about to fall off.\n\n==Pre-launch conditions==\n\n===Delays===\n''Challenger'' was originally set to launch from [[Kennedy Space Center]] in Florida at 14:42 [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Standard Time (EST)]] on Wednesday, January 22, 1986. Delays in the previous mission, [[STS-61-C]], caused the launch date to be moved to January 23 and then to January 24. The launch was rescheduled again, to Saturday, January 25, due to [[storm|bad weather]] at the [[Space Shuttle abort modes#Transoceanic abort landing|transoceanic abort landing (TAL)]] site in [[Dakar|Dakar, Senegal]]. NASA decided to use the TAL site at [[Casablanca|Casablanca, Morocco]], but because it was not equipped for night landings, the launch had to be moved to the morning. Predictions of unacceptable weather at Kennedy Space Center on January 26 caused the launch to be rescheduled for 09:37 EST on Monday, January 27.<ref>{{cite web|title=STS-51-L mission archives|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/archives/sts-51L.html|publisher=NASA}}</ref>\n\nThe planned January 27 launch was initially delayed due to problems with the [[Space Shuttle orbiter#Pressurized cabin|exterior access hatch]].

The Shuttle was never certified to operate in temperatures that low. The O-rings, as well as many other critical components, had no test data to support any expectation of a successful launch in such conditions.<ref name=\"bergin20070128\"/><ref name=\"berkes20120206\"/>\n\nBy mid-1985 Thiokol engineers worried that others did not share their concerns about the low temperature effects on the boosters. Engineer Bob Ebeling in October 1985 wrote a memo\u2014titled \"Help!\" so others would read it\u2014of concerns regarding low temperatures and O-rings. After the weather forecast, NASA personnel remembered Thiokol's warnings and contacted the company. When a Thiokol manager asked Ebeling about the possibility of a launch at {{convert|18|F|||}}, he answered \"[W]e're only qualified to 40\u00b0 [{{convert|40|F|disp=or||}}]{{nbsp}}... 'what business does anyone even have thinking about 18\u00b0, we're in no-man's land.'\" After his team agreed that a launch risked disaster, Thiokol immediately called NASA recommending a postponement until temperatures rose in the afternoon. NASA manager Jud Lovingood responded that Thiokol could not make the recommendation without providing a safe temperature. The company prepared for a teleconference two hours later during which it would have to justify a no-launch recommendation.<ref name=\"bergin20070128\">{{cite web | author=Chris Bergin| title=Remembering the mistakes of Challenger | url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2007/01/remembering-the-mistakes-of-challenger/ | work=nasaspaceflight.com | date=January 28, 2007 | accessdate=August 5, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"berkes20120206\"/>\n\nAt the teleconference on the evening of January 27, Thiokol engineers and managers discussed the weather conditions with NASA managers from Kennedy Space Center and Marshall Space Flight Center. Several engineers (most notably Ebeling and [[Roger Boisjoly]]) reiterated their concerns about the effect of low temperatures on the resilience of the rubber O-rings that sealed the joints of the SRBs, and recommended a launch postponement.<ref name=\"berkes 20120206\"/> They argued that they did not have enough data to determine whether the joints would properly seal if the O-rings were colder than {{convert|12|C|order=flip}}. This was an important consideration, since the SRB O-rings had been designated as a \"Criticality 1\" component, meaning that there was no backup if both the primary and secondary O-rings failed, and their failure could destroy the Orbiter and kill its crew.\n\nThiokol management initially supported its engineers' recommendation to postpone the launch, but NASA staff opposed a delay. During the conference call, Hardy told Thiokol, \"I am appalled. I am appalled by your recommendation.\" Mulloy said, \"My God, Thiokol, when do you want me to launch\u2014next April?\"<ref name=\"berkes 20120206\"/> NASA believed that Thiokol hastily prepared presentation's quality was too poor to support such a statement on flight safety.<ref name=\"bergin20070128\"/> One argument by NASA personnel contesting Thiokol's concerns was that if the primary O-ring failed, the secondary O-ring would still seal. This was unproven, and was in any case an argument that did not apply to a \"Criticality 1\" component. As astronaut [[Sally Ride]] stated when questioning NASA managers before the Rogers Commission, it is forbidden to rely on a backup for a \"Criticality 1\" component.\n\nNASA claimed that it did not know of Thiokol earlier concerns about the effects of the cold on the O-rings, and did not understand that [[Rockwell International]], the shuttle's prime contractor, additionally viewed the large amount of ice present on the pad as a constraint to launch.\n\nAccording to Ebeling, a second conference call was scheduled with only NASA and Thiokol management, excluding the engineers. For reasons that are unclear, Thiokol management disregarded its own engineers' warnings and now recommended that the launch proceed as scheduled;<ref name=\"berkes20120206\"/><ref name=\"rogers 5\">{{cite book| author=Rogers Commission | title=Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident|chapter= Chapter V: The Contributing Cause of The Accident | date=June 6, 1986| chapter-url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch5.htm |accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref> NASA did not ask why.{{r|bergin20070128}} Ebeling told his wife that night that ''Challenger'' would blow up.<ref>{{cite web | author=Ware, Doug G. | title = Engineer who warned of 1986 Challenger disaster still racked with guilt, three decades on | date=January 28, 2016 | publisher=United Press International | url = http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2016/01/28/Engineer-who-warned-of-1986-Challenger-disaster-still-racked-with-guilt-three-decades-on/4891454032643/ | accessdate=January 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\nKen Iliff, a former NASA Chief Scientist who had worked on the Space Shuttle Program since its first mission (and the X-15 program before that), stated this in 2004:\n{{quote | text=Not violating flight rules was something I had been taught on the X-15 program.

Ice had accumulated all over the launch pad, raising concerns that ice could damage the shuttle upon lift-off. The Kennedy Ice Team inadvertently pointed an infrared camera at the aft field joint of the right SRB and found the temperature to be only {{convert|\u221213|C|F|order=flip}}. This was believed to be the result of supercooled air blowing on the joint from the [[Liquid oxygen|liquid oxygen (LOX)]] tank vent. It was much lower than the air temperature and far below the design specifications for the O-rings. The low reading was later determined to be erroneous, the error caused by not following the temperature probe manufacturer's instructions. Tests and adjusted calculations later confirmed that the temperature of the joint was not substantially different from the ambient temperature.\n\nThe temperature on the day of the launch was far lower than had been the case with previous launches: below freezing at {{convert|\u22122.2|to|\u22121.7|C|order=flip}}; previously, the coldest launch had been at {{convert|12|C|order=flip}}. Although the Ice Team had worked through the night removing ice, engineers at Rockwell still expressed concern. Rockwell engineers watching the pad from their headquarters in [[Downey, California]], were horrified when they saw the amount of ice. They feared that during launch, ice might be shaken loose and strike the shuttle's thermal protection tiles, possibly due to the aspiration induced by the [[jet (fluid)|jet]] of [[exhaust gas]] from the SRBs. [[Rocco Petrone]], the head of Rockwell's space transportation division, and his colleagues viewed this situation as a launch constraint, and told Rockwell's managers at the Cape that Rockwell could not support a launch. Rockwell's managers at the Cape voiced their concerns in a manner that led Houston-based mission manager Arnold Aldrich to go ahead with the launch. Aldrich decided to postpone the shuttle launch by an hour to give the Ice Team time to perform another inspection.

Numerous other timelines have been written based on this information. A detailed transcript of air-to-ground and mission control voice communications was put together by journalists Rob Navias and William Harwood, integrating a timeline of events:{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/challenger/timeline/ |title=Challenger timeline |publisher=NASA/Spaceflight Now |accessdate=January 28, 2016}}</ref> All times are given in seconds after launch and correspond to the telemetry time-codes from the closest instrumented event to each described event.<ref name=\"rogers n\">{{cite book| author=Rogers Commission | title=Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident|chapter= Volume 3: Appendix N \u2013 NASA Photo and TV Support Team Report| date=June 6, 1986 |chapter-url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v3appn.htm | accessdate=January 1, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Space Shuttle main engine]]s (SSMEs) were ignited at T -6.6 seconds. The SSMEs were liquid-fueled and could be safely shut down (and the launch aborted if necessary) until the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket booster]]s (SRBs) ignited at T=0 (which was at 11:38:00.010 EST) and the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster#Hold-down posts|hold-down bolts]] were released with explosives, freeing the vehicle from the pad. At lift off, the three SSMEs were at 100% of their original rated performance, and began throttling up to [[Space Shuttle main engine#Engine throttle/output|104%]] under computer control. With the first vertical motion of the vehicle, the gaseous hydrogen vent arm retracted from the [[Space Shuttle external tank|external tank (ET)]] but failed to latch back. Review of film shot by pad cameras showed that the arm did not re-contact the vehicle, and thus it was ruled out as a contributing factor in the accident.<ref name=\"rogers n\"/> The post-launch inspection of the pad also revealed that kick springs on four of the hold-down bolts were missing, but they were similarly ruled out as a possible cause.<ref name=\"tv team\">{{cite video | people= Photo and TV Analysis Team Report| title =Space Shuttle Challenger Accident Investigation| url =https://archive.org/details/ChallengerAccidentandInvestigation| publisher=STS-51L Data and Analysis Task Force |year = 1986 | accessdate=January 1, 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Challenger Launch and Breakup.ogv|thumb|''Challenger'' launch and breakup]]\n\nLater review of launch film showed that at T+0.678, strong puffs of dark gray smoke were emitted from the right-hand SRB near the [[aft]] strut that attached the booster to the ET. The last smoke puff occurred at about T+2.733. The last view of smoke around the strut was at T+3.375. It was later determined that these smoke puffs were caused by the opening and closing of the aft field joint of the right-hand SRB. The booster's casing had ballooned under the stress of ignition. As a result of this ballooning, the metal parts of the casing bent away from each other, opening a gap through which hot gases\u2014above {{convert|2760|C|order=flip}}\u2014leaked. This had occurred in previous launches, but each time the primary O-ring had shifted out of its groove and formed a seal. Although the SRB was not designed to function this way, it appeared to work well enough, and Morton-Thiokol changed the design specs to accommodate this process, known as [[extrusion]].\n\nWhile extrusion was taking place, hot gases leaked past (a process called \"blow-by\"), damaging the O-rings until a seal was made. Investigations by Morton-Thiokol engineers determined that the amount of damage to the O-rings was directly related to the time it took for extrusion to occur, and that cold weather, by causing the O-rings to harden, lengthened the time of extrusion. The redesigned SRB field joint used subsequent to the ''Challenger'' accident used an additional interlocking mortise and tang with a third O-ring, mitigating blow-by.\n\nOn the morning of the disaster, the primary O-ring had become so hard due to the cold that it could not seal in time. The temperature had dropped below the [[glass transition]] temperature of the O-rings. Above the glass transition temperature, the O-rings display properties of elasticity and flexibility, while below the glass transition temperature, they become rigid and brittle. The secondary O-ring was not in its seated position due to the metal bending. There was now no barrier to the gases, and both O-rings were vaporized across 70 degrees of arc. [[Aluminium oxide|Aluminum oxides]] from the burned solid propellant sealed the damaged joint, temporarily replacing the O-ring seal before flame passed through the joint.\n\nAs the vehicle cleared the tower, the SSMEs were operating at [[Space Shuttle main engine#Thrust specifications|104% of their rated maximum thrust]], and control switched from the [[Launch Control Center]] (LCC) at Kennedy to the Mission Control Center (MCC) at [[Johnson Space Center]] in [[Houston]], [[Texas]]. To prevent [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] forces from structurally overloading the orbiter, at T+28 the SSMEs began throttling down to limit the velocity of the shuttle in the dense [[troposphere|lower atmosphere]], per normal operating procedure. At T+35.379, the SSMEs throttled back further to the planned 65%. Five seconds later, at about {{convert|19000|ft}}, ''Challenger'' passed through [[Mach number|Mach 1]]. At T+51.860, the SSMEs began throttling back up to 104% as the vehicle passed beyond [[max q]], the period of maximum aerodynamic pressure on the vehicle.\n\n===Plume===\n[[File:Booster Rocket Breach - GPN-2000-001425.jpg|thumb|Plume on right SRB at T+ 58.788 seconds]]\n\nBeginning at about T+37 and for 27 seconds, the shuttle experienced a series of [[Wind shear#Impact on passenger aircraft|wind shear]] events that were stronger than on any previous flight.<ref>{{cite web| author=NASA Mission Archives| title=STS-51L | url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/archives/sts-51L.html | accessdate=January 31, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAt T+58.788, a tracking film camera captured the beginnings of a [[plume (hydrodynamics)|plume]] near the aft attach strut on the right SRB. Unknown to those on ''Challenger'' or in Houston, hot gas had begun to leak through a growing hole in one of the right-hand SRB joints. The force of the wind shear shattered the temporary oxide seal that had taken the place of the damaged O-rings, removing the last barrier to flame passing through the joint. Had it not been for the wind shear, the fortuitous oxide seal might have held through booster burnout.\n\nWithin a second, the plume became well defined and intense. Internal pressure in the right SRB began to drop because of the rapidly enlarging hole in the failed joint, and at T+60.238 there was visual evidence of flame burning through the joint and impinging on the external tank.<ref name=\"timeline\"/>\n\nAt T+64.660, the plume suddenly changed shape, indicating that a leak had begun in the [[liquid hydrogen]] (LH2) tank, located in the aft portion of the external tank. The nozzles of the main engines pivoted under computer control to compensate for the unbalanced thrust produced by the booster burn-through. The pressure in the shuttle's external LH2 tank began to drop at T+66.764, indicating the effect of the leak.<ref name=\"timeline\"/>\n\nAt this stage the situation still seemed normal both to the crew and to flight controllers. At T+68, the [[Capsule communicator|CAPCOM]] [[Richard O. Covey]] informed the crew that they were \"go at throttle up\"<!-- the grammar is correct, the full phrasing used in some other shuttle missions was \"you are go at throttle up\" -->, and Commander [[Dick Scobee]] confirmed, \"Roger, go at throttle up\"; this was the last communication from ''Challenger'' on the air-to-ground loop.<ref name=\"timeline\"/>\n\n===Vehicle breakup===\n[[File:Challenger (STS-51-L) Tracking Camera.webm|thumb|A tracking camera located north of the pad captured the SRB plume as it burned through the external tank.

Later analysis of telemetry data showed a sudden lateral acceleration to the right at T+72.525, which may have been felt by the crew. The last statement captured by the crew cabin recorder came just half a second after this acceleration, when Pilot [[Michael J. Smith (astronaut)|Michael J.

At the same time, the right SRB rotated about the forward attach strut, and struck the [[Space Shuttle external tank#Intertank|intertank]] structure. The external tank at this point suffered a complete structural failure, the LH2 and LOX tanks rupturing, mixing, and igniting, creating a fireball that enveloped the whole stack.<ref name=\"kerthan\">{{cite web| author=Than, Ker| title=5 Myths of Challenger Shuttle Disaster Debunked | date=January 7, 2011| url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/01/pictures/110127-challenger-disaster-space-shuttle-25th-anniversary-myths-science-nasa/| accessdate=October 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe breakup of the vehicle began at T+73.162 seconds and at an altitude of {{convert|48000|ft|km}}.<ref name=\"kerwin\">{{cite web|last=Kerwin | first=Joseph P. |authorlink=Joseph P.

The two SRBs, which could withstand greater aerodynamic loads, separated from the ET and continued in uncontrolled powered flight. The SRB casings were made of half-inch-thick (12.7&nbsp;mm) steel and were much stronger than the orbiter and ET; thus, both SRBs survived the breakup of the space shuttle stack, even though the right SRB was still suffering the effects of the joint burn-through that had set the destruction of ''Challenger'' in motion.<ref name=\"tv team\" />\n\nThe more robustly constructed crew cabin also survived the breakup of the launch vehicle, as it was designed to survive {{convert|20|psi|kPa|abbr=on}} while the estimated pressure it had been subjected to during orbiter breakup was only about {{convert|4\u20135|psi|kPa|abbr=on}}.

They had believed that any O-ring failure would have occurred at liftoff, and thus were happy to see the shuttle successfully leave the launch pad.

Television screens showed a cloud of smoke and water vapor (the product of hydrogen+oxygen combustion) where ''Challenger'' had been, with pieces of debris falling toward the ocean. At about T+89, flight director [[Jay Greene]] prompted his [[Flight controller#Flight Dynamics Officer .28FDO or FIDO.29 2|Flight Dynamics Officer]] (FIDO) for information. FIDO responded that \"the {{bracket|[[radar]]}} filter has discreting sources\", a further indication that ''Challenger'' had broken into multiple pieces. Moments later, the [[Ground Controller|ground controller]] reported \"negative contact (and) loss of [[Telecommunications link#Downlink|downlink]]\" of radio and telemetry data from ''Challenger''. Greene ordered his team to \"watch your data carefully\" and look for any sign that the Orbiter had escaped.\n\n[[File:Challenger Mission Control.ogv|thumb|Mission Control during the liftoff of ''Challenger'' (STS-51-L)]]\n\nAt T+110.250, the range safety officer (RSO) at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] sent radio signals that activated the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster#Range safety system|range safety system]]'s \"destruct\" packages on board both solid rocket boosters.

The forces involved at this stage were probably insufficient to cause major injury.\n\nAt least some of the crew were alive and at least briefly conscious after the breakup, as three of the four recovered [[Personal Egress Air Packs]] (PEAPs) on the flight deck were found to have been activated.<ref>[http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/51-l/docs/kerwin.txt Joseph P.

Mike Mullane wrote, \"These switches were protected with lever locks that required them to be pulled outward against a spring force before they could be moved to a new position.\" Later tests established that neither force of the explosion nor the impact with the ocean could have moved them, indicating that Smith made the switch changes, presumably in a futile attempt to restore electrical power to the cockpit after the crew cabin detached from the rest of the orbiter.<ref name=Mullane>{{Cite book | last = Mullane | first = Mike | authorlink = Mike Mullane | title = Riding Rockets: The Outrageous Tales of a Space Shuttle Astronaut | publisher=Simon and Schuster | year = 2006 | page = 245 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8X7ceB3QEWkC&pg=PA245 | isbn = 978-0-7432-7682-5 }}</ref>\n\nWhether the crew members remained conscious long after the breakup is unknown, and largely depends on whether the detached crew cabin maintained pressure integrity. If it did not, the time of useful consciousness at that altitude is just a few seconds; the PEAPs supplied only unpressurized air, and hence would not have helped the crew to retain consciousness. If, on the other hand, the cabin was not depressurized or only slowly depressurizing, they may have been conscious for the entire fall until impact. Recovery of the cabin found that the middeck floor had not suffered buckling or tearing, as would result from a rapid decompression, thus providing some evidence that the depressurization may not have happened suddenly.\n\nNASA routinely trained shuttle crews for splashdown events, but the cabin hit the ocean surface at roughly {{convert|207|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, with an estimated deceleration at impact of well over 200 [[g-force|g]], far beyond the structural limits of the crew compartment or crew survivability levels, and far greater than almost any automobile, aircraft, or train accident. The crew would have been torn from their seats and killed instantly by the extreme impact force.<ref name=\"kerwin\"/>\n\nOn July 28, 1986, NASA's Associate Administrator for Space Flight, former astronaut [[Richard H. Truly]], released a report on the deaths of the crew from the director of Space and Life Sciences at the [[Johnson Space Center]], [[Joseph P. Kerwin]]. A medical doctor and former astronaut, Kerwin was a veteran of the 1973 [[Skylab 2]] mission. According to the Kerwin Report:\n\n{{quote|The findings are inconclusive. The impact of the crew compartment with the ocean surface was so violent that evidence of damage occurring in the seconds which followed the disintegration was masked. Our final conclusions are:\n* the cause of death of the ''Challenger'' astronauts cannot be positively determined;\n* the forces to which the crew were exposed during Orbiter breakup were probably not sufficient to cause death or serious injury; and\n* the crew possibly, but not certainly, lost consciousness in the seconds following Orbiter breakup due to in-flight loss of crew module pressure.<ref name=\"kerwin\"/>}}\n\nSome experts believe most if not all of the crew were alive and possibly conscious during the entire descent until impact with the ocean. Astronaut and NASA lead accident investigator [[Robert F. Overmyer|Robert Overmyer]] said, \"I not only flew with Dick Scobee, we owned a plane together, and I know Scob did everything he could to save his crew. Scob fought for any and every edge to survive. He flew that ship without wings all the way down{{nbsp}}... they were alive.\"<ref name=\"Breakup\" />\n\n===Prospect of crew escape===\n{{Further2|[[Space Shuttle abort modes#Ejection escape systems|Shuttle ejection escape systems]], [[Space Shuttle abort modes#Post-Challenger abort enhancements|Post-''Challenger'' abort enhancements]]}}\n\nDuring powered flight of the space shuttle, crew escape was not possible. Launch escape systems were considered several times during shuttle development, but NASA's conclusion was that the shuttle's expected high reliability would preclude the need for one. Modified [[Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird|SR-71 Blackbird]] [[ejection seat]]s and full [[pressure suit]]s were used for the two-man crews on the first four shuttle orbital missions, which were considered test flights, but they were removed for the \"operational\" missions that followed. The [[Columbia Accident Investigation Board]] later declared, after the 2003 [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' re-entry disaster]], that the space shuttle system should never have been declared operational because it is experimental by nature due to the limited number of flights as compared to certified commercial aircraft. The multi-deck design of the crew cabin precluded use of such ejection seats for larger crews. Providing some sort of launch escape system had been considered, but deemed impractical due to \"limited utility, technical complexity and excessive cost in dollars, weight or schedule delays\".<ref name=\"rogers 9\" />{{efn|name=\"n1\"}}\n\nAfter the loss of ''Challenger'', the question was re-opened, and NASA considered several different options, including ejector seats, tractor rockets, and emergency egress through the bottom of the orbiter. NASA once again concluded that all of the launch escape systems considered would be impractical due to the sweeping vehicle modifications that would have been necessary and the resultant limitations on crew size. A system was designed to give the crew the option to leave the shuttle during [[gliding (flight)|gliding flight]], but this system would not have been usable in the ''Challenger'' situation.<ref>{{cite web| author=Rogers Commission | title=Implementation of the Recommendations of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident, Recommendation VII |date=June 1987 | url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v6ch6.htm | accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===White House response===\n{{wikisource|Ronald Reagan Announces the Challenger Disaster}}\n[[File:Reagan Space Shuttle Challenger Speech.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=15|[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] addresses the nation after the shuttle disaster.]]\n\n[[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] had been scheduled to give the [[1986 State of the Union Address]] on the evening of the ''Challenger'' disaster.

[[Search and rescue]] aircraft were also dispatched.

The largest intact section was the rear wall containing the two payload bay windows and the airlock. All windows in the cabin had been destroyed, with only small bits of glass still attached to the frames. Impact forces appeared to be greatest on the left side, indicating that it had struck the water in a nose-down, left-end-first position.\n\n[[File:STS-51-L Recovered Debris (Burn Marks on the SRM) - GPN-2004-00004.jpg|thumb|Recovered right solid rocket booster showing the hole caused by the plume]]\n\nInside the twisted debris of the crew cabin were the bodies of the astronauts, which after weeks of immersion in salt water and exposure to scavenging marine life were in a \"semi-liquefied state that bore little resemblance to anything living\", although according to John Devlin, the skipper of the USS ''Preserver'', they \"were not as badly mangled as you'd see in some aircraft accidents\".

Due to the hazardous nature of the recovery operation (the cabin was filled with large pieces of protruding jagged metal), the Navy divers protested that they would not go on with the work unless the cabin was hauled onto the ship's deck.\n\nDuring the recovery of the remains of the crew, Gregory Jarvis's body floated out of the shattered crew compartment and was lost to the diving team. A day later, it was seen floating on the ocean's surface. It sank as a team prepared to pull it from the water. Determined not to end the recovery operations without retrieving Jarvis, astronaut [[Robert Crippen]] rented a fishing boat at his own expense and went searching for the body. On April 15, near the end of the salvage operations, the Navy divers found Jarvis. His body had settled to the sea floor, {{convert|101.2|ft}} below the surface, some {{convert|0.7|nmi}} from the final resting place of the crew compartment. The body was recovered and brought to the surface before being processed with the other crew members and then prepared for release to Jarvis's family.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3078060/ns/technology_and_science-space/t/chapter-raising-heroes-sea/#.Wx3ZCTOZORs|title=Chapter 6: Raising heroes from the sea|date=2006-01-25|work=msnbc.com|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en}}</ref>\n\nNavy pathologists performed autopsies on the crew members, but due to the poor condition of the bodies, the exact cause of death could not be determined for any of them. The crew transfer took place on April 29, 1986, three months and one day after the accident. Seven hearses carried the crew's remains from the Life Sciences Facility on Cape Canaveral to a waiting [[Military Airlift Command|MAC]] [[C-141]] aircraft. Their caskets were each draped with an American flag and carried past an honor guard and followed by an astronaut escort. The astronaut escorts for the ''Challenger'' crew were: Dan Brandenstein, Jim Buckley, Norm Thagard, Charles Bolden, Tammy Jernigan, Dick Richards, and Loren Shriver. Once the crew's remains were aboard the jet, they were flown to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to be processed and then released to their relatives.\n\nIt had been suggested early in the investigation that the accident was caused by inadvertent detonation of the Range Safety destruct charges on the external tank, but the charges were recovered mostly intact and a quick overview of telemetry data immediately ruled out that theory.\n\nThe three shuttle main engines were found largely intact and still attached to the thrust assembly despite extensive damage from impact with the ocean, marine life, and immersion in salt water. They had considerable heat damage due to a LOX-rich shutdown caused by the drop in hydrogen fuel pressure as the external tank began to fail. The memory units from Engines{{nbsp}}1 and{{nbsp}}2 were recovered, cleaned, and their contents analyzed, which confirmed normal engine operation until LH2 starvation began starting at T+72 seconds. Loss of fuel pressure and rising combustion chamber temperatures caused the computers to shut off the engines. Since there was no evidence of abnormal SSME behavior until 72 seconds (only one second or so before the breakup of ''Challenger''\u200a), the engines were ruled out as a contributing factor in the accident.\n\nOther recovered orbiter components showed no indication of pre-breakup malfunction. Recovered parts of the TDRSS satellite also did not disclose any abnormalities other than damage caused by vehicle breakup, impact, and immersion in salt water. The solid rocket motor boost stage for the payload had not ignited either and was quickly ruled out as a cause of the accident.\n\nThe solid rocket booster debris had no signs of explosion (other than the Range Safety charges splitting the casings open), or propellant debonding/cracking. There was no question about the RSO manually destroying the SRBs following vehicle breakup, so the idea of the destruct charges accidentally detonating was ruled out. Premature separation of the SRBs from the stack or inadvertent activation of the recovery system was also considered, but telemetry data quickly disproved that idea. Nor was there any evidence of in-flight structural failure since visual and telemetry evidence showed that the SRBs remained structurally intact up to and beyond vehicle breakup. The aft field joint on the right SRB did show extensive burn damage.\n\nTelemetry proved that the right SRB, after the failure of the lower struts, had come loose and struck the external tank. The exact point where the struts broke could not be determined from film of the launch, nor were the struts or the adjacent section of the external tank recovered during salvage operations. Based on the location of the rupture in the right SRB, the P12 strut most likely failed first. The SRB's nose cone also exhibited some impact damage from this behavior (for comparison, the left SRB nose cone had no damage at all) and the intertank region had signs of impact damage as well. In addition, the orbiter's right wing had impact and burn damage from the right SRB colliding with it following vehicle breakup.\n\nMost of the initially considered failure modes were soon ruled out and by May 1, enough of the right solid rocket booster had been recovered to determine the original cause of the accident, and the major salvage operations were concluded. While some shallow-water recovery efforts continued, this was unconnected with the accident investigation; it aimed to recover debris for use in NASA's studies of the properties of materials used in spacecraft and launch vehicles.<ref name=\"rogers o\"/> The recovery operation was able to pull {{convert|15|ST}} of debris from the ocean; this means that 55% of ''Challenger'', 5% of the crew cabin and 65% of the satellite cargo are still missing.<ref name=\"FamousPictures\">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.famouspictures.org/challenger-explosion/| title = Challenger| publisher=Famous Pictures Magazine| accessdate=July 19, 2012 | last= Lucas, Dean}}</ref> Some of the missing debris continued to wash up on Florida shores for some years, such as on December 17, 1996, nearly 11 years after the incident, when two large pieces of the shuttle were found at [[Cocoa Beach, Florida|Cocoa Beach]].<ref name=\"cnn_debris\">{{Cite news| title = Shuttle Challenger debris washes up on shore| work = CNN| date = 17 December 1996| access-date = 8 January 2020| url = http://www.cnn.com/TECH/9612/17/challenger.debris/index.html| |url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20010413220636/https://www.cnn.com/TECH/9612/17/challenger.debris/index.html|archive-date=13 April 2001| quote = The parts -- a 6- by 15-foot rectangular section and a 4- by 8-foot section -- may be part of the rudder tail, wing, or body flap sections of the space shuttle, according to NASA spokesman Lisa Malone.}}</ref> Under {{USC|18|641}} it is against the law to be in possession of ''Challenger'' debris, and any newly discovered pieces must be turned over to NASA.<ref name=\"collectSpace\">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-070501a.html| title = Seller admits to ''Challenger'' debris fraud| publisher=collectSpace.com| accessdate=July 19, 2007 | last=collectSpace.com}}</ref>\n\nOn board ''Challenger'' was an American flag, dubbed the [[Challenger flag]], that was sponsored by [[Scouting in Colorado|Boy Scout]] Troop 514 of [[Monument, Colorado]].

The commission members were Chairman [[William P. Rogers]], Vice Chairman [[Neil Armstrong]], [[David Campion Acheson|David Acheson]], [[Eugene E. Covert|Eugene Covert]], [[Richard Feynman]], Robert Hotz, [[Donald J. Kutyna|Donald Kutyna]], [[Sally Ride]], Robert Rummel, [[Joe Sutter|Joseph Sutter]], [[Arthur B. C. Walker, Jr.|Arthur Walker]], Albert Wheelon, and [[Chuck Yeager]]. The commission worked for several months and published a report of its findings. It found that the ''Challenger'' accident was caused by a failure in the O-rings sealing a joint on the right solid rocket booster, which allowed pressurized hot gases and eventually flame to \"blow by\" the O-ring and make contact with the adjacent external tank, causing structural failure. The failure of the O-rings was attributed to a faulty design, whose performance could be too easily compromised by factors including the low ambient temperature on the day of launch. The O-rings would not work properly at ambient temperatures below {{convert|10|C|order=flip}}- and it was {{convert|2|C|order=flip}} on the morning of the launch.<ref> https://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/explode.html</ref><ref>{{cite book| author=Rogers Commission | title=Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident|chapter= Chapter IV: The Cause of the Accident | date=June 6, 1986| chapter-url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch4.htm| accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Rogers Commission members arrive at Kennedy Space Center.jpg|thumb|Members of the [[Rogers Commission]] arrive at [[Kennedy Space Center]].]]\n\nMore broadly, the report also considered the contributing causes of the accident. Most salient was the failure of both NASA and Morton-Thiokol to respond adequately to the danger posed by the deficient joint design. Rather than redesigning the joint, they came to define the problem as an acceptable flight risk. The report found that managers at Marshall had known about the flawed design since 1977, but never discussed the problem outside their reporting channels with Thiokol\u2014a flagrant violation of NASA regulations. Even when it became more apparent how serious the flaw was, no one at Marshall considered grounding the shuttles until a fix could be implemented. On the contrary, Marshall managers went as far as to issue and waive six launch constraints related to the O-rings.<ref name=\"Rogers_vol6\" /> The report also strongly criticized the decision-making process that led to the launch of ''Challenger'', saying that it was seriously flawed:<ref name=\"rogers 5\" />\n\n{{bquote|failures in communication{{nbsp}}... resulted in a decision to launch 51-L based on incomplete and sometimes misleading information, a conflict between engineering data and management judgments, and a NASA management structure that permitted internal flight safety problems to bypass key Shuttle managers.<ref name=\"rogers 5\" />}}\n\n====Richard Feynman====\nOne of the commission's members was theoretical physicist [[Richard Feynman]]. Feynman, who was then seriously ill with cancer, was reluctant to undertake the job. He did so to find the root cause of the disaster and to speak plainly to the public about his findings.<ref>Freeman Dyson, 2011, \"The Dramatic Picture of Richard Feynman\" New York Review of Books, July 14, 2011.

Whereas NASA had held an internal inquiry into the [[Apollo 1]] fire in 1967, its actions after ''Challenger'' were more constrained by the judgment of outside bodies. The Rogers Commission offered nine recommendations on improving safety in the space shuttle program, and NASA was directed by President Reagan to report back within thirty days as to how it planned to implement those recommendations.<ref name=\"implementation report\">{{cite web| title = Report to the President: Actions to Implement the Recommendations of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident|publisher=NASA| date=July 14, 1986| url = https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/actions.pdf }}</ref>\n\nWhen the disaster happened, the Air Force had performed extensive modifications of its [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|Space Launch Complex 6]] (SLC-6, pronounced as \"Slick Six\") at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] in California, for launch and landing operations of classified Shuttle launches of satellites in polar orbit, and was planning its first polar flight for October 15, 1986.

The ''Challenger'' loss motivated the Air Force to set in motion a chain of events that finally led to the May 13, 1988, decision to cancel its Vandenberg Shuttle launch plans in favor of the [[Titan IV]] uncrewed launch vehicle.\n\nIn response to the commission's recommendation, NASA initiated a total redesign of the space shuttle's solid rocket boosters, which was watched over by an independent oversight group as stipulated by the commission.<ref name=\"implementation report\"/> NASA's contract with [[Thiokol|Morton-Thiokol]], the contractor responsible for the solid rocket boosters, included a clause stating that in the event of a failure leading to \"loss of life or mission\", Thiokol would forfeit $10&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|10|1986|r=1|fmt=c}}{{nbsp}}million today) of its incentive fee and formally accept legal liability for the failure.

After the accident, NASA attempted to aim at a more realistic shuttle flight rate: it added another orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', to the space shuttle fleet to replace ''Challenger'', and it worked with the Department of Defense to put more satellites in orbit using [[expendable launch vehicle]]s rather than the shuttle.<ref name=\"rogerscommission\">{{cite web| author=Rogers Commission | title=Implementation of the Recommendations of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident, Recommendation VII|date=June 1987 | url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v6ch7.htm | accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref> In August 1986, President Reagan also announced that the shuttle would no longer carry commercial [[satellite]] payloads.<ref name=\"rogerscommission\" /> After a 32-month hiatus, the next shuttle mission, [[STS-26]], was launched on September 29, 1988.\n\nAlthough changes were made by NASA after the ''Challenger'' accident, many commentators have argued that the changes in its management structure and organizational culture were neither deep nor long-lasting.\n\nAfter the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' disaster]] in 2003, attention once again focused on the attitude of NASA management towards safety issues. The [[Columbia Accident Investigation Board]] (CAIB) concluded that NASA had failed to learn many of the lessons of ''Challenger''.

Both Palmer and CBS anchor [[Dan Rather]] reacted to cameras catching live video of something descending by parachute into the area where ''Challenger'' debris was falling with confusion and speculation that a crew member may have ejected from the shuttle and survived. The shuttle had no individual ejection seats or a crew escape capsule. Mission control identified the parachute as a paramedic parachuting into the area but this was also incorrect based on internal speculation at mission control. The chute was the parachute and nose cone from one of the solid rocket boosters which had been destroyed by the [[range safety]] officer after the explosion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spaceflightnow.com/challenger/timeline/#|title=Spaceflight Now - The Challenger Accident - Timeline|website=spaceflightnow.com}}</ref> Due to McAuliffe's presence on the mission, NASA arranged for many US public schools to view the launch live on [[NASA TV]].<ref name=myths>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/11031097\n | title = 7 myths about the Challenger shuttle disaster\n | author=James Oberg\n |publisher=NBC News | date=January 25, 2011}}</ref> As a result, many who were schoolchildren in the US in 1986 had the opportunity to view the launch live.

He argues that if Morton-Thiokol engineers had more clearly presented the data that they had on the relationship between low temperatures and burn-through in the solid rocket booster joints, they might have succeeded in persuading NASA managers to cancel the launch. To demonstrate this, he took all of the data he claimed the engineers had presented during the briefing, and reformatted it onto a single graph of O-ring damage versus external launch temperature, showing the effects of cold on the degree of O-ring damage. Tufte then placed the proposed launch of ''Challenger'' on the graph according to its predicted temperature at launch. According to Tufte, the launch temperature of ''Challenger'' was so far below the coldest launch, with the worst damage seen to date, that even a casual observer could have determined that the risk of disaster was severe.<ref>[[Edward Tufte]]. (1997) ''Visual Explanations'', {{ISBN|978-0-9613921-2-3}}, Chapter 2.</ref>\n\nTufte has also argued that poor presentation of information may have also affected NASA decisions during the last flight of the space shuttle ''[[Columbia disaster|Columbia]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001yB&topic_id=1|title= PowerPoint Does Rocket Science\u2014and Better Techniques for Technical Reports |accessdate=January 28, 2007 |author=Tufte, Edward}}</ref>\n\nBoisjoly, Wade Robison, a [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] professor, and their colleagues have vigorously repudiated Tufte's conclusions about the Morton-Thiokol engineers' role in the loss of ''Challenger''. First, they argue that the engineers didn't have the information available as Tufte claimed: \"But they did not know the temperatures even though they did try to obtain that information.

The large number of children who saw the accident live or in replays the same day was well known that day, and influenced the speech President Reagan gave that evening.\n\n{{Quote|text=I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who were watching the live coverage of the shuttle's takeoff.

The majority of children's memories of ''Challenger'' were often clear and consistent, and even things like personal placement such as who they were with or what they were doing when they heard the news were remembered well. In one U.S. study, children's memories were recorded and tested again. Children on the East Coast recalled the event more easily than children on the West Coast, due to the time difference. Children on the East Coast either saw the explosion on TV while in school, or heard people talking about it. On the other side of the country, most children were either on their way to school, or just beginning their morning classes. Researchers found that those children who saw the explosion on TV had a more emotional connection to the event, and thus had an easier time remembering it. After one year the children's memories were tested, and those on the East Coast recalled the event better than their West Coast counterparts. Regardless of where they were when it happened, the ''Challenger'' explosion was still an important event that many children easily remembered.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Connect with us!|journal= The American Journal of Psychiatry|doi=10.1176/ajp.153.5.618|pmid=8615406|volume=153|issue=5|year=1996|pages=618\u201325 | last1 = Terr | first1 = LC | last2 = Bloch | first2 = DA | last3 = Michel | first3 = BA | last4 = Shi | first4 = H | last5 = Reinhardt | first5 = JA | last6 = Metayer | first6 = S}}</ref>\n\n===Continuation of the Shuttle program===\nAfter the accident, NASA's Space Shuttle fleet was grounded for almost three years while the investigation, hearings, engineering redesign of the SRBs, and other behind-the-scenes technical and management reviews, changes, and preparations were taking place.

Its crew included [[Richard O. Covey]], who had given the last status callout to ''Challenger'' before its breakup, \"Challenger, go at throttle up\". The shuttle carried a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, TDRS-C (named TDRS-3 after deployment), which replaced TDRS-B, the satellite that was launched and lost on ''Challenger''. The \"Return to Flight\" launch of ''Discovery'' also represented a test of the redesigned boosters, a shift to a more conservative stance on safety (being the first time the crew had launched in pressure suits since STS-4, the last of the four initial Shuttle test flights), and a chance to restore national pride in the American space program, especially crewed space flight. The mission, [[STS-26]], was a success (with only two minor system failures, one of a cabin cooling system and one of a Ku-band antenna), and a regular schedule of STS flights followed, continuing without extended interruption until the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|2003 ''Columbia'' disaster]].\n\n[[Barbara Morgan]], the backup for McAuliffe who trained with her in the Teacher in Space program and was at KSC watching her launch on January 28, 1986, flew on [[STS-118]] as a Mission Specialist in August 2007.\n\n=== Other civilian passenger plans ===\nNASA had intended to send a wide range of civilian passengers into space on subsequent flights.

The crew consisted of five [[NASA]] [[astronaut]]s, one [[payload specialist]], and a civilian schoolteacher. The mission carried the designation [[STS-51-L]] and was the tenth flight for the ''Challenger'' [[Space Shuttle orbiter|orbiter]]. \n\nThe spacecraft disintegrated over the [[Atlantic Ocean]], off the coast of [[Cape Canaveral, Florida|Cape Canaveral]], [[Florida]], at 11:39{{nbsp}}a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] (16:39 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). The disintegration of the vehicle began after a joint in its right [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket booster]] (SRB) failed at liftoff. The failure was caused by the failure of [[O-ring]] seals used in the joint that were not designed to handle the unusually cold conditions that existed at this launch. The seals' failure caused a breach in the SRB joint, allowing pressurized burning gas from within the solid rocket motor to reach the outside and impinge upon the adjacent SRB aft field joint attachment hardware and [[Space Shuttle external tank|external fuel tank]]. This led to the separation of the right-hand SRB's aft field joint attachment and the [[Structural integrity and failure|structural failure]] of the external tank. [[Aerodynamic]] forces broke up the orbiter.\n\nThe crew compartment and many other vehicle fragments were eventually recovered from the ocean floor after a lengthy search and recovery operation. The exact timing of the death of the crew is unknown; several crew members are known to have survived the initial breakup of the spacecraft. The shuttle had no escape system,{{efn|name=\"n1\"|The first two Space Shuttle orbiters, ''Enterprise'' and ''Columbia'', originally had [[Space Shuttle abort modes#Ejection seat|ejection seats]] installed in the flight deck for the pilot and co-pilot in the initial test missions.

The pilot's ejection seats were disabled after [[STS-4]] and subsequently removed by the launch of [[STS-61]] on January 12, 1986, and were never installed on the remaining four orbiters.}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Shuttle Carrying New Escape System|publisher=Associated Press|access-date=October 23, 2016|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1988/Shuttle-Carrying-New-Escape-System/id-50c3be84147652b242204463a5b036d5|date=September 27, 1988|last1=Tolley|first1=Laura}}</ref> and the impact of the crew compartment at [[terminal velocity]] with the ocean surface was too violent to be survivable.<ref>{{cite news|last=Abramson |first=Rudy |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=April 8, 1988 |title=Shuttle to Have Device Enabling Crew to Escape |quote=Studies in the wake of the Challenger disaster showed that astronauts probably would not survive an ocean ditching{{nbsp}}...

The Rogers Commission found NASA's [[organizational culture]] and decision-making processes had been key contributing factors to the accident,<ref>{{cite web | author=Outer Space Universe| title=Remembering the Challenger Shuttle Explosion: A Disaster 25 Years Ago | url=http://www.outerspaceuniverse.org/remembering-challenger-shuttle-explosion-25-years.html | accessdate=January 28, 2011}}</ref> with the agency violating its own safety rules. NASA managers had known since 1977 that contractor [[Thiokol|Morton-Thiokol]]'s design of the SRBs contained a potentially catastrophic flaw in the O-rings, but they had failed to address this problem properly. NASA managers also disregarded warnings from engineers about the dangers of launching posed by the low temperatures of that morning, and failed to adequately report these technical concerns to their superiors.\n\nApproximately 17 percent of the American population witnessed the launch on live television broadcast because of the presence of high school teacher [[Christa McAuliffe]], who would have been the first [[Teacher in Space Project|teacher in space]]. Media coverage of the accident was extensive; one study reported that 85&nbsp;percent of Americans surveyed had heard the news within an hour of the accident.<ref>{{cite web|title=On January 28, 1986, Space Shuttle Challenger Exploded 76 Seconds After Launch (Video) |url=http://www.viralvideobox.com/on-january-28-1986-space-shuttle-challenger-exploded-76-seconds-after-launch-video/|work=Viral Video Box|accessdate=January 28, 2014}}</ref> The ''Challenger'' disaster has been used as a case study in many discussions of engineering safety and workplace ethics.\n\n==O-ring concerns==\n[[File:STS-51-L - Space Shuttle Challenger on the Crawler-Transporter.jpg|thumb|''Challenger'' being carried atop a [[Crawler-transporter]] on the way to the launch pad]]\n\nEach of the Space Shuttle's two Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) was constructed of seven sections, six of which were permanently joined in pairs at the factory. For each flight, the four resulting segments were then assembled in the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] at [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC), with three field joints. The factory joints were sealed with asbestos-silica insulation applied over the joint, while each field joint was sealed with two rubber O-rings. After the destruction of ''Challenger'', the number of O-rings per field joint was increased to three.<ref>{{cite web|title=Solid Rocket Motor Joint Reliability|url=http://engineer.jpl.nasa.gov/practices/1257.pdf|publisher=NASA Engineering}}</ref> The seals of all of the SRB joints were required to contain the hot, high-pressure gases produced by the burning solid propellant inside, thus forcing them out of the nozzle at the aft end of each rocket.\n\nDuring the [[Space Shuttle design process]], a [[McDonnell Douglas]] report in September 1971 discussed the safety record of solid rockets. While a safe abort was possible after most types of failures, one was especially dangerous: a burnthrough by hot gases of the rocket's casing. The report stated that \"if burnthrough occurs adjacent to [liquid hydrogen/oxygen] tank or orbiter, timely sensing may not be feasible and abort not possible\", accurately foreshadowing the ''Challenger'' accident.<ref name=\"heppenheimer1998\">{{cite book | title=The Space Shuttle Decision | publisher=NASA publication SP-4221 | author=Heppenheimer, T.

As originally designed by Thiokol, the O-ring joints in the SRBs were supposed to close more tightly due to forces generated at ignition, but a 1977 test showed that when pressurized water was used to simulate the effects of booster combustion, the metal parts bent away from each other, opening a gap through which gases could leak. This phenomenon, known as \"joint rotation\", caused a momentary drop in air pressure. This made it possible for combustion gases to erode the O-rings. In the event of widespread erosion, a flame path could develop, causing the joint to burst\u2014which would have destroyed the booster and the shuttle.<ref name=\"Major Malfunction\">{{cite book | last=McConnell | first=Malcolm | date=1987 | title=Challenger: A Major Malfunction | location=Garden City, NY | publisher=Doubleday | isbn=978-0-385-23877-9 | url=https://archive.org/details/challengermajorm00mcco }}</ref>{{rp|118}}\n\nEngineers at the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] wrote to the manager of the Solid Rocket Booster project, George Hardy, on several occasions suggesting that Thiokol's field joint design was unacceptable. For example, one engineer suggested that joint rotation would render the secondary O-ring useless, but Hardy did not forward these memos to Thiokol, and the field joints were accepted for flight in 1980.<ref name=\"Rogers_vol6\">{{cite web |author=Rogers Commission |title=Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident, Chapter VI: An Accident Rooted in History |date=June 6, 1986 |url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch6.htm }}</ref>\n\nEvidence of serious O-ring erosion was present as early as the second space shuttle mission, [[STS-2]], which was flown by ''Columbia''. Contrary to NASA regulations, the Marshall Center did not report this problem to senior management at NASA, but opted to keep the problem within their reporting channels with Thiokol. Even after the O-rings were redesignated as \"Criticality 1\" \u2014 meaning that their failure would result in the destruction of the Orbiter, no one at Marshall suggested that the shuttles be grounded until the flaw could be fixed.<ref name=\"Rogers_vol6\" />\n\nAfter the 1984 launch of [[STS-41-D]], flown by ''Discovery'', the first occurrence of hot gas \"blow-by\" was discovered beyond the primary O-ring. In the post-flight analysis, [[Thiokol]] engineers found that the amount of blow-by was relatively small and had not impinged upon the secondary O-ring, and concluded that for future flights, the damage was an acceptable risk. However, after the ''Challenger'' disaster, [[Thiokol]] engineer Brian Russell identified this event as the first \"big red flag\" regarding O-ring safety.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vaughan|first=Diane|title=The Challenger launch decision: risky technology, culture, and deviance at NASA|year=1996|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-85175-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/challengerlaunch00dian/page/143 143]\u201344|url=https://archive.org/details/challengerlaunch00dian|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nBy 1985, with seven of nine shuttle launches that year using boosters displaying O-ring erosion or hot gas blow-by,<ref>{{cite book|last=Vaughan|first=Diane|title=The Challenger launch decision: risky technology, culture, and deviance at NASA|year=1996|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-85175-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/challengerlaunch00dian/page/153 153]|url=https://archive.org/details/challengerlaunch00dian|url-access=registration}}</ref> Marshall and Thiokol realized that they had a potentially catastrophic problem on their hands. Perhaps most concerning was the launch of [[STS-51-B]] in April 1985, flown by ''Challenger'', in which the worst O-ring damage to date was discovered in post-flight analysis.

This tang would grip the inner face of the joint and prevent it from rotating. They did not call for a halt to shuttle flights until the joints could be redesigned, but rather treated the problem as an acceptable flight risk. For example, Lawrence Mulloy, Marshall's manager for the SRB project since 1982, issued and waived launch constraints for six consecutive flights. Thiokol even went as far as to persuade NASA to declare the O-ring problem \"closed\".<ref name=\"Rogers_vol6\" /> [[Donald J.

Delays in the previous mission, [[STS-61-C]], caused the launch date to be moved to January 23 and then to January 24. The launch was rescheduled again, to Saturday, January 25, due to [[storm|bad weather]] at the [[Space Shuttle abort modes#Transoceanic abort landing|transoceanic abort landing (TAL)]] site in [[Dakar|Dakar, Senegal]]. NASA decided to use the TAL site at [[Casablanca|Casablanca, Morocco]], but because it was not equipped for night landings, the launch had to be moved to the morning. Predictions of unacceptable weather at Kennedy Space Center on January 26 caused the launch to be rescheduled for 09:37 EST on Monday, January 27.<ref>{{cite web|title=STS-51-L mission archives|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/archives/sts-51L.html|publisher=NASA}}</ref>\n\nThe planned January 27 launch was initially delayed due to problems with the [[Space Shuttle orbiter#Pressurized cabin|exterior access hatch]].

The Shuttle was never certified to operate in temperatures that low. The O-rings, as well as many other critical components, had no test data to support any expectation of a successful launch in such conditions.<ref name=\"bergin20070128\"/><ref name=\"berkes20120206\"/>\n\nBy mid-1985 Thiokol engineers worried that others did not share their concerns about the low temperature effects on the boosters. Engineer Bob Ebeling in October 1985 wrote a memo\u2014titled \"Help!\" so others would read it\u2014of concerns regarding low temperatures and O-rings. After the weather forecast, NASA personnel remembered Thiokol's warnings and contacted the company. When a Thiokol manager asked Ebeling about the possibility of a launch at {{convert|18|F|||}}, he answered \"[W]e're only qualified to 40\u00b0 [{{convert|40|F|disp=or||}}]{{nbsp}}... 'what business does anyone even have thinking about 18\u00b0, we're in no-man's land.'\" After his team agreed that a launch risked disaster, Thiokol immediately called NASA recommending a postponement until temperatures rose in the afternoon. NASA manager Jud Lovingood responded that Thiokol could not make the recommendation without providing a safe temperature. The company prepared for a teleconference two hours later during which it would have to justify a no-launch recommendation.<ref name=\"bergin20070128\">{{cite web | author=Chris Bergin| title=Remembering the mistakes of Challenger | url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2007/01/remembering-the-mistakes-of-challenger/ | work=nasaspaceflight.com | date=January 28, 2007 | accessdate=August 5, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"berkes20120206\"/>\n\nAt the teleconference on the evening of January 27, Thiokol engineers and managers discussed the weather conditions with NASA managers from Kennedy Space Center and Marshall Space Flight Center. Several engineers (most notably Ebeling and [[Roger Boisjoly]]) reiterated their concerns about the effect of low temperatures on the resilience of the rubber O-rings that sealed the joints of the SRBs, and recommended a launch postponement.<ref name=\"berkes20120206\"/> They argued that they did not have enough data to determine whether the joints would properly seal if the O-rings were colder than {{convert|12|C|order=flip}}. This was an important consideration, since the SRB O-rings had been designated as a \"Criticality 1\" component, meaning that there was no backup if both the primary and secondary O-rings failed, and their failure could destroy the Orbiter and kill its crew.\n\nThiokol management initially supported its engineers' recommendation to postpone the launch, but NASA staff opposed a delay. During the conference call, Hardy told Thiokol, \"I am appalled. I am appalled by your recommendation.\" Mulloy said, \"My God, Thiokol, when do you want me to launch\u2014next April?\"<ref name=\"berkes20120206\"/> NASA believed that Thiokol's hastily prepared presentation's quality was too poor to support such a statement on flight safety.<ref name=\"bergin20070128\"/> One argument by NASA personnel contesting Thiokol's concerns was that if the primary O-ring failed, the secondary O-ring would still seal. This was unproven, and was in any case an argument that did not apply to a \"Criticality 1\" component. As astronaut [[Sally Ride]] stated when questioning NASA managers before the Rogers Commission, it is forbidden to rely on a backup for a \"Criticality 1\" component.\n\nNASA claimed that it did not know of Thiokol's earlier concerns about the effects of the cold on the O-rings, and did not understand that [[Rockwell International]], the shuttle's prime contractor, additionally viewed the large amount of ice present on the pad as a constraint to launch.\n\nAccording to Ebeling, a second conference call was scheduled with only NASA and Thiokol management, excluding the engineers. For reasons that are unclear, Thiokol management disregarded its own engineers' warnings and now recommended that the launch proceed as scheduled;<ref name=\"berkes20120206\"/><ref name=\"rogers 5\">{{cite book| author=Rogers Commission | title=Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident|chapter= Chapter V: The Contributing Cause of The Accident | date=June 6, 1986| chapter-url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch5.htm |accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref> NASA did not ask why.{{r|bergin20070128}} Ebeling told his wife that night that ''Challenger'' would blow up.<ref>{{cite web | author=Ware, Doug G. | title = Engineer who warned of 1986 Challenger disaster still racked with guilt, three decades on | date=January 28, 2016 | publisher=United Press International | url = http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2016/01/28/Engineer-who-warned-of-1986-Challenger-disaster-still-racked-with-guilt-three-decades-on/4891454032643/ | accessdate=January 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\nKen Iliff, a former NASA Chief Scientist who had worked on the Space Shuttle Program since its first mission (and the X-15 program before that), stated this in 2004:\n{{quote | text=Not violating flight rules was something I had been taught on the X-15 program.

Ice had accumulated all over the launch pad, raising concerns that ice could damage the shuttle upon lift-off. The Kennedy Ice Team inadvertently pointed an infrared camera at the aft field joint of the right SRB and found the temperature to be only {{convert|\u221213|C|F|order=flip}}. This was believed to be the result of supercooled air blowing on the joint from the [[Liquid oxygen|liquid oxygen (LOX)]] tank vent. It was much lower than the air temperature and far below the design specifications for the O-rings. The low reading was later determined to be erroneous, the error caused by not following the temperature probe manufacturer's instructions. Tests and adjusted calculations later confirmed that the temperature of the joint was not substantially different from the ambient temperature.\n\nThe temperature on the day of the launch was far lower than had been the case with previous launches: below freezing at {{convert|\u22122.2|to|\u22121.7|C|order=flip}}; previously, the coldest launch had been at {{convert|12|C|order=flip}}. Although the Ice Team had worked through the night removing ice, engineers at Rockwell still expressed concern. Rockwell engineers watching the pad from their headquarters in [[Downey, California]], were horrified when they saw the amount of ice. They feared that during launch, ice might be shaken loose and strike the shuttle's thermal protection tiles, possibly due to the aspiration induced by the [[jet (fluid)|jet]] of [[exhaust gas]] from the SRBs. [[Rocco Petrone]], the head of Rockwell's space transportation division, and his colleagues viewed this situation as a launch constraint, and told Rockwell's managers at the Cape that Rockwell could not support a launch. Rockwell's managers at the Cape voiced their concerns in a manner that led Houston-based mission manager Arnold Aldrich to go ahead with the launch. Aldrich decided to postpone the shuttle launch by an hour to give the Ice Team time to perform another inspection. After that last inspection, during which the ice appeared to be melting, ''Challenger'' was cleared to launch at 11:38&nbsp;am EST.<ref name=\"rogers 5\" />\n{{clear right}}\n\n==January 28 launch and failure==\n{{further|STS-51-L Mission timeline}}\n\n===Liftoff and initial ascent===\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2011}}\n<!-- This entire section reads like an official NASA report which I've read.

The SSMEs were liquid-fueled and could be safely shut down (and the launch aborted if necessary) until the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket booster]]s (SRBs) ignited at T=0 (which was at 11:38:00.010 EST) and the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster#Hold-down posts|hold-down bolts]] were released with explosives, freeing the vehicle from the pad. At lift off, the three SSMEs were at 100% of their original rated performance, and began throttling up to [[Space Shuttle main engine#Engine throttle/output|104%]] under computer control. With the first vertical motion of the vehicle, the gaseous hydrogen vent arm retracted from the [[Space Shuttle external tank|external tank (ET)]] but failed to latch back. Review of film shot by pad cameras showed that the arm did not re-contact the vehicle, and thus it was ruled out as a contributing factor in the accident.<ref name=\"rogers n\"/> The post-launch inspection of the pad also revealed that kick springs on four of the hold-down bolts were missing, but they were similarly ruled out as a possible cause.<ref name=\"tv team\">{{cite video | people= Photo and TV Analysis Team Report| title =Space Shuttle Challenger Accident Investigation| url =https://archive.org/details/ChallengerAccidentandInvestigation| publisher=STS-51L Data and Analysis Task Force |year = 1986 | accessdate=January 1, 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Challenger Launch and Breakup.ogv|thumb|''Challenger'' launch and breakup]]\n\nLater review of launch film showed that at T+0.678, strong puffs of dark gray smoke were emitted from the right-hand SRB near the [[aft]] strut that attached the booster to the ET. The last smoke puff occurred at about T+2.733. The last view of smoke around the strut was at T+3.375. It was later determined that these smoke puffs were caused by the opening and closing of the aft field joint of the right-hand SRB. The booster's casing had ballooned under the stress of ignition. As a result of this ballooning, the metal parts of the casing bent away from each other, opening a gap through which hot gases\u2014above {{convert|2760|C|order=flip}}\u2014leaked. This had occurred in previous launches, but each time the primary O-ring had shifted out of its groove and formed a seal. Although the SRB was not designed to function this way, it appeared to work well enough, and Morton-Thiokol changed the design specs to accommodate this process, known as [[extrusion]].\n\nWhile extrusion was taking place, hot gases leaked past (a process called \"blow-by\"), damaging the O-rings until a seal was made. Investigations by Morton-Thiokol engineers determined that the amount of damage to the O-rings was directly related to the time it took for extrusion to occur, and that cold weather, by causing the O-rings to harden, lengthened the time of extrusion. The redesigned SRB field joint used subsequent to the ''Challenger'' accident used an additional interlocking mortise and tang with a third O-ring, mitigating blow-by.\n\nOn the morning of the disaster, the primary O-ring had become so hard due to the cold that it could not seal in time. The temperature had dropped below the [[glass transition]] temperature of the O-rings. Above the glass transition temperature, the O-rings display properties of elasticity and flexibility, while below the glass transition temperature, they become rigid and brittle. The secondary O-ring was not in its seated position due to the metal bending. There was now no barrier to the gases, and both O-rings were vaporized across 70 degrees of arc. [[Aluminium oxide|Aluminum oxides]] from the burned solid propellant sealed the damaged joint, temporarily replacing the O-ring seal before flame passed through the joint.\n\nAs the vehicle cleared the tower, the SSMEs were operating at [[Space Shuttle main engine#Thrust specifications|104% of their rated maximum thrust]], and control switched from the [[Launch Control Center]] (LCC) at Kennedy to the Mission Control Center (MCC) at [[Johnson Space Center]] in [[Houston]], [[Texas]]. To prevent [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] forces from structurally overloading the orbiter, at T+28 the SSMEs began throttling down to limit the velocity of the shuttle in the dense [[troposphere|lower atmosphere]], per normal operating procedure. At T+35.379, the SSMEs throttled back further to the planned 65%. Five seconds later, at about {{convert|19000|ft}}, ''Challenger'' passed through [[Mach number|Mach 1]]. At T+51.860, the SSMEs began throttling back up to 104% as the vehicle passed beyond [[max q]], the period of maximum aerodynamic pressure on the vehicle.\n\n===Plume===\n[[File:Booster Rocket Breach - GPN-2000-001425.jpg|thumb|Plume on right SRB at T+ 58.788 seconds]]\n\nBeginning at about T+37 and for 27 seconds, the shuttle experienced a series of [[Wind shear#Impact on passenger aircraft|wind shear]] events that were stronger than on any previous flight.<ref>{{cite web| author=NASA Mission Archives| title=STS-51L | url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/archives/sts-51L.html | accessdate=January 31, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAt T+58.788, a tracking film camera captured the beginnings of a [[plume (hydrodynamics)|plume]] near the aft attach strut on the right SRB. Unknown to those on ''Challenger'' or in Houston, hot gas had begun to leak through a growing hole in one of the right-hand SRB joints. The force of the wind shear shattered the temporary oxide seal that had taken the place of the damaged O-rings, removing the last barrier to flame passing through the joint. Had it not been for the wind shear, the fortuitous oxide seal might have held through booster burnout.\n\nWithin a second, the plume became well defined and intense. Internal pressure in the right SRB began to drop because of the rapidly enlarging hole in the failed joint, and at T+60.238 there was visual evidence of flame burning through the joint and impinging on the external tank.<ref name=\"timeline\"/>\n\nAt T+64.660, the plume suddenly changed shape, indicating that a leak had begun in the [[liquid hydrogen]] (LH2) tank, located in the aft portion of the external tank. The nozzles of the main engines pivoted under computer control to compensate for the unbalanced thrust produced by the booster burn-through. The pressure in the shuttle's external LH2 tank began to drop at T+66.764, indicating the effect of the leak.<ref name=\"timeline\"/>\n\nAt this stage the situation still seemed normal both to the crew and to flight controllers. At T+68, the [[Capsule communicator|CAPCOM]] [[Richard O. Covey]] informed the crew that they were \"go at throttle up\"<!-- the grammar is correct, the full phrasing used in some other shuttle missions was \"you are go at throttle up\" -->, and Commander [[Dick Scobee]] confirmed, \"Roger, go at throttle up\"; this was the last communication from ''Challenger'' on the air-to-ground loop.<ref name=\"timeline\"/>\n\n===Vehicle breakup===\n[[File:Challenger (STS-51-L) Tracking Camera.webm|thumb|A tracking camera located north of the pad captured the SRB plume as it burned through the external tank.

Later analysis of telemetry data showed a sudden lateral acceleration to the right at T+72.525, which may have been felt by the crew. The last statement captured by the crew cabin recorder came just half a second after this acceleration, when Pilot [[Michael J. Smith (astronaut)|Michael J.

The two SRBs, which could withstand greater aerodynamic loads, separated from the ET and continued in uncontrolled powered flight. The SRB casings were made of half-inch-thick (12.7&nbsp;mm) steel and were much stronger than the orbiter and ET; thus, both SRBs survived the breakup of the space shuttle stack, even though the right SRB was still suffering the effects of the joint burn-through that had set the destruction of ''Challenger'' in motion.<ref name=\"tv team\" />\n\nThe more robustly constructed crew cabin also survived the breakup of the launch vehicle, as it was designed to survive {{convert|20|psi|kPa|abbr=on}} while the estimated pressure it had been subjected to during orbiter breakup was only about {{convert|4\u20135|psi|kPa|abbr=on}}.

The forces involved at this stage were probably insufficient to cause major injury.\n\nAt least some of the crew were alive and at least briefly conscious after the breakup, as three of the four recovered [[Personal Egress Air Packs]] (PEAPs) on the flight deck were found to have been activated.<ref>[http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/51-l/docs/kerwin.txt Joseph P.

Mike Mullane wrote, \"These switches were protected with lever locks that required them to be pulled outward against a spring force before they could be moved to a new position.\" Later tests established that neither force of the explosion nor the impact with the ocean could have moved them, indicating that Smith made the switch changes, presumably in a futile attempt to restore electrical power to the cockpit after the crew cabin detached from the rest of the orbiter.<ref name=Mullane>{{Cite book | last = Mullane | first = Mike | authorlink = Mike Mullane | title = Riding Rockets: The Outrageous Tales of a Space Shuttle Astronaut | publisher=Simon and Schuster | year = 2006 | page = 245 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8X7ceB3QEWkC&pg=PA245 | isbn = 978-0-7432-7682-5 }}</ref>\n\nWhether the crew members remained conscious long after the breakup is unknown, and largely depends on whether the detached crew cabin maintained pressure integrity. If it did not, the time of useful consciousness at that altitude is just a few seconds; the PEAPs supplied only unpressurized air, and hence would not have helped the crew to retain consciousness. If, on the other hand, the cabin was not depressurized or only slowly depressurizing, they may have been conscious for the entire fall until impact. Recovery of the cabin found that the middeck floor had not suffered buckling or tearing, as would result from a rapid decompression, thus providing some evidence that the depressurization may not have happened suddenly.\n\nNASA routinely trained shuttle crews for splashdown events, but the cabin hit the ocean surface at roughly {{convert|207|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, with an estimated deceleration at impact of well over 200 [[g-force|g]], far beyond the structural limits of the crew compartment or crew survivability levels, and far greater than almost any automobile, aircraft, or train accident. The crew would have been torn from their seats and killed instantly by the extreme impact force.<ref name=\"kerwin\"/>\n\nOn July 28, 1986, NASA's Associate Administrator for Space Flight, former astronaut [[Richard H. Truly]], released a report on the deaths of the crew from the director of Space and Life Sciences at the [[Johnson Space Center]], [[Joseph P. Kerwin]]. A medical doctor and former astronaut, Kerwin was a veteran of the 1973 [[Skylab 2]] mission. According to the Kerwin Report:\n\n{{quote|The findings are inconclusive. The impact of the crew compartment with the ocean surface was so violent that evidence of damage occurring in the seconds which followed the disintegration was masked. Our final conclusions are:\n* the cause of death of the ''Challenger'' astronauts cannot be positively determined;\n* the forces to which the crew were exposed during Orbiter breakup were probably not sufficient to cause death or serious injury; and\n* the crew possibly, but not certainly, lost consciousness in the seconds following Orbiter breakup due to in-flight loss of crew module pressure.<ref name=\"kerwin\"/>}}\n\nSome experts believe most if not all of the crew were alive and possibly conscious during the entire descent until impact with the ocean. Astronaut and NASA lead accident investigator [[Robert F. Overmyer|Robert Overmyer]] said, \"I not only flew with Dick Scobee, we owned a plane together, and I know Scob did everything he could to save his crew. Scob fought for any and every edge to survive. He flew that ship without wings all the way down{{nbsp}}... they were alive.\"<ref name=\"Breakup\" />\n\n===Prospect of crew escape===\n{{Further2|[[Space Shuttle abort modes#Ejection escape systems|Shuttle ejection escape systems]], [[Space Shuttle abort modes#Post-Challenger abort enhancements|Post-''Challenger'' abort enhancements]]}}\n\nDuring powered flight of the space shuttle, crew escape was not possible. Launch escape systems were considered several times during shuttle development, but NASA's conclusion was that the shuttle's expected high reliability would preclude the need for one. Modified [[Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird|SR-71 Blackbird]] [[ejection seat]]s and full [[pressure suit]]s were used for the two-man crews on the first four shuttle orbital missions, which were considered test flights, but they were removed for the \"operational\" missions that followed. The [[Columbia Accident Investigation Board]] later declared, after the 2003 [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' re-entry disaster]], that the space shuttle system should never have been declared operational because it is experimental by nature due to the limited number of flights as compared to certified commercial aircraft. The multi-deck design of the crew cabin precluded use of such ejection seats for larger crews. Providing some sort of launch escape system had been considered, but deemed impractical due to \"limited utility, technical complexity and excessive cost in dollars, weight or schedule delays\".<ref name=\"rogers 9\" />{{efn|name=\"n1\"}}\n\nAfter the loss of ''Challenger'', the question was re-opened, and NASA considered several different options, including ejector seats, tractor rockets, and emergency egress through the bottom of the orbiter. NASA once again concluded that all of the launch escape systems considered would be impractical due to the sweeping vehicle modifications that would have been necessary and the resultant limitations on crew size. A system was designed to give the crew the option to leave the shuttle during [[gliding (flight)|gliding flight]], but this system would not have been usable in the ''Challenger'' situation.<ref>{{cite web| author=Rogers Commission | title=Implementation of the Recommendations of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident, Recommendation VII |date=June 1987 | url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v6ch6.htm | accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===White House response===\n{{wikisource|Ronald Reagan Announces the Challenger Disaster}}\n[[File:Reagan Space Shuttle Challenger Speech.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=15|[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] addresses the nation after the shuttle disaster.]]\n\n[[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] had been scheduled to give the [[1986 State of the Union Address]] on the evening of the ''Challenger'' disaster.

Impact forces appeared to be greatest on the left side, indicating that it had struck the water in a nose-down, left-end-first position.\n\n[[File:STS-51-L Recovered Debris (Burn Marks on the SRM) - GPN-2004-00004.jpg|thumb|Recovered right solid rocket booster showing the hole caused by the plume]]\n\nInside the twisted debris of the crew cabin were the bodies of the astronauts, which after weeks of immersion in salt water and exposure to scavenging marine life were in a \"semi-liquefied state that bore little resemblance to anything living\", although according to John Devlin, the skipper of the USS ''Preserver'', they \"were not as badly mangled as you'd see in some aircraft accidents\".

A day later, it was seen floating on the ocean's surface. It sank as a team prepared to pull it from the water. Determined not to end the recovery operations without retrieving Jarvis, astronaut [[Robert Crippen]] rented a fishing boat at his own expense and went searching for the body.

The crew transfer took place on April 29, 1986, three months and one day after the accident. Seven hearses carried the crew's remains from the Life Sciences Facility on Cape Canaveral to a waiting [[Military Airlift Command|MAC]] [[C-141]] aircraft. Their caskets were each draped with an American flag and carried past an honor guard and followed by an astronaut escort. The astronaut escorts for the ''Challenger'' crew were: Dan Brandenstein, Jim Buckley, Norm Thagard, Charles Bolden, Tammy Jernigan, Dick Richards, and Loren Shriver. Once the crew's remains were aboard the jet, they were flown to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to be processed and then released to their relatives.\n\nIt had been suggested early in the investigation that the accident was caused by inadvertent detonation of the Range Safety destruct charges on the external tank, but the charges were recovered mostly intact and a quick overview of telemetry data immediately ruled out that theory.\n\nThe three shuttle main engines were found largely intact and still attached to the thrust assembly despite extensive damage from impact with the ocean, marine life, and immersion in salt water. They had considerable heat damage due to a LOX-rich shutdown caused by the drop in hydrogen fuel pressure as the external tank began to fail. The memory units from Engines{{nbsp}}1 and{{nbsp}}2 were recovered, cleaned, and their contents analyzed, which confirmed normal engine operation until LH2 starvation began starting at T+72 seconds. Loss of fuel pressure and rising combustion chamber temperatures caused the computers to shut off the engines. Since there was no evidence of abnormal SSME behavior until 72 seconds (only one second or so before the breakup of ''Challenger''\u200a), the engines were ruled out as a contributing factor in the accident.\n\nOther recovered orbiter components showed no indication of pre-breakup malfunction. Recovered parts of the TDRSS satellite also did not disclose any abnormalities other than damage caused by vehicle breakup, impact, and immersion in salt water. The solid rocket motor boost stage for the payload had not ignited either and was quickly ruled out as a cause of the accident.\n\nThe solid rocket booster debris had no signs of explosion (other than the Range Safety charges splitting the casings open), or propellant debonding/cracking. There was no question about the RSO manually destroying the SRBs following vehicle breakup, so the idea of the destruct charges accidentally detonating was ruled out. Premature separation of the SRBs from the stack or inadvertent activation of the recovery system was also considered, but telemetry data quickly disproved that idea. Nor was there any evidence of in-flight structural failure since visual and telemetry evidence showed that the SRBs remained structurally intact up to and beyond vehicle breakup. The aft field joint on the right SRB did show extensive burn damage.\n\nTelemetry proved that the right SRB, after the failure of the lower struts, had come loose and struck the external tank. The exact point where the struts broke could not be determined from film of the launch, nor were the struts or the adjacent section of the external tank recovered during salvage operations. Based on the location of the rupture in the right SRB, the P12 strut most likely failed first. The SRB's nose cone also exhibited some impact damage from this behavior (for comparison, the left SRB nose cone had no damage at all) and the intertank region had signs of impact damage as well. In addition, the orbiter's right wing had impact and burn damage from the right SRB colliding with it following vehicle breakup.\n\nMost of the initially considered failure modes were soon ruled out and by May 1, enough of the right solid rocket booster had been recovered to determine the original cause of the accident, and the major salvage operations were concluded. While some shallow-water recovery efforts continued, this was unconnected with the accident investigation; it aimed to recover debris for use in NASA's studies of the properties of materials used in spacecraft and launch vehicles.<ref name=\"rogers o\"/> The recovery operation was able to pull {{convert|15|ST}} of debris from the ocean; this means that 55% of ''Challenger'', 5% of the crew cabin and 65% of the satellite cargo are still missing.<ref name=\"FamousPictures\">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.famouspictures.org/challenger-explosion/| title = Challenger| publisher=Famous Pictures Magazine| accessdate=July 19, 2012 | last= Lucas, Dean}}</ref> Some of the missing debris continued to wash up on Florida shores for some years, such as on December 17, 1996, nearly 11 years after the incident, when two large pieces of the shuttle were found at [[Cocoa Beach, Florida|Cocoa Beach]].<ref name=\"cnn_debris\">{{Cite news| title = Shuttle Challenger debris washes up on shore| work = CNN| date = 17 December 1996| access-date = 8 January 2020| url = http://www.cnn.com/TECH/9612/17/challenger.debris/index.html| |url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20010413220636/https://www.cnn.com/TECH/9612/17/challenger.debris/index.html|archive-date=13 April 2001| quote = The parts -- a 6- by 15-foot rectangular section and a 4- by 8-foot section -- may be part of the rudder tail, wing, or body flap sections of the space shuttle, according to NASA spokesman Lisa Malone.}}</ref> Under {{USC|18|641}} it is against the law to be in possession of ''Challenger'' debris, and any newly discovered pieces must be turned over to NASA.<ref name=\"collectSpace\">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-070501a.html| title = Seller admits to ''Challenger'' debris fraud| publisher=collectSpace.com| accessdate=July 19, 2007 | last=collectSpace.com}}</ref>\n\nOn board ''Challenger'' was an American flag, dubbed the [[Challenger flag]], that was sponsored by [[Scouting in Colorado|Boy Scout]] Troop 514 of [[Monument, Colorado]].

The commission members were Chairman [[William P. Rogers]], Vice Chairman [[Neil Armstrong]], [[David Campion Acheson|David Acheson]], [[Eugene E. Covert|Eugene Covert]], [[Richard Feynman]], Robert Hotz, [[Donald J. Kutyna|Donald Kutyna]], [[Sally Ride]], Robert Rummel, [[Joe Sutter|Joseph Sutter]], [[Arthur B. C. Walker, Jr.|Arthur Walker]], Albert Wheelon, and [[Chuck Yeager]]. The commission worked for several months and published a report of its findings. It found that the ''Challenger'' accident was caused by a failure in the O-rings sealing a joint on the right solid rocket booster, which allowed pressurized hot gases and eventually flame to \"blow by\" the O-ring and make contact with the adjacent external tank, causing structural failure. The failure of the O-rings was attributed to a faulty design, whose performance could be too easily compromised by factors including the low ambient temperature on the day of launch. The O-rings would not work properly at ambient temperatures below {{convert|10|C|order=flip}}- and it was {{convert|2|C|order=flip}} on the morning of the launch.<ref> https://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/explode.html</ref><ref>{{cite book| author=Rogers Commission | title=Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident|chapter= Chapter IV: The Cause of the Accident | date=June 6, 1986| chapter-url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch4.htm| accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Rogers Commission members arrive at Kennedy Space Center.jpg|thumb|Members of the [[Rogers Commission]] arrive at [[Kennedy Space Center]].]]\n\nMore broadly, the report also considered the contributing causes of the accident. Most salient was the failure of both NASA and Morton-Thiokol to respond adequately to the danger posed by the deficient joint design. Rather than redesigning the joint, they came to define the problem as an acceptable flight risk. The report found that managers at Marshall had known about the flawed design since 1977, but never discussed the problem outside their reporting channels with Thiokol\u2014a flagrant violation of NASA regulations. Even when it became more apparent how serious the flaw was, no one at Marshall considered grounding the shuttles until a fix could be implemented. On the contrary, Marshall managers went as far as to issue and waive six launch constraints related to the O-rings.<ref name=\"Rogers_vol6\" /> The report also strongly criticized the decision-making process that led to the launch of ''Challenger'', saying that it was seriously flawed:<ref name=\"rogers 5\" />\n\n{{bquote|failures in communication{{nbsp}}... resulted in a decision to launch 51-L based on incomplete and sometimes misleading information, a conflict between engineering data and management judgments, and a NASA management structure that permitted internal flight safety problems to bypass key Shuttle managers.<ref name=\"rogers 5\" />}}\n\n====Richard Feynman====\nOne of the commission's members was theoretical physicist [[Richard Feynman]]. Feynman, who was then seriously ill with cancer, was reluctant to undertake the job. He did so to find the root cause of the disaster and to speak plainly to the public about his findings.<ref>Freeman Dyson, 2011, \"The Dramatic Picture of Richard Feynman\" New York Review of Books, July 14, 2011. Reprinted in {{ISBN|978-1-59017-854-6}}</ref> \nBefore going to Washington, D.C., Feynman did his own investigation.

Whereas NASA had held an internal inquiry into the [[Apollo 1]] fire in 1967, its actions after ''Challenger'' were more constrained by the judgment of outside bodies. The Rogers Commission offered nine recommendations on improving safety in the space shuttle program, and NASA was directed by President Reagan to report back within thirty days as to how it planned to implement those recommendations.<ref name=\"implementation report\">{{cite web| title = Report to the President: Actions to Implement the Recommendations of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident|publisher=NASA| date=July 14, 1986| url = https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/actions.pdf }}</ref>\n\nWhen the disaster happened, the Air Force had performed extensive modifications of its [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|Space Launch Complex 6]] (SLC-6, pronounced as \"Slick Six\") at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] in California, for launch and landing operations of classified Shuttle launches of satellites in polar orbit, and was planning its first polar flight for October 15, 1986.

The ''Challenger'' loss motivated the Air Force to set in motion a chain of events that finally led to the May 13, 1988, decision to cancel its Vandenberg Shuttle launch plans in favor of the [[Titan IV]] uncrewed launch vehicle.\n\nIn response to the commission's recommendation, NASA initiated a total redesign of the space shuttle's solid rocket boosters, which was watched over by an independent oversight group as stipulated by the commission.<ref name=\"implementation report\"/> NASA's contract with [[Thiokol|Morton-Thiokol]], the contractor responsible for the solid rocket boosters, included a clause stating that in the event of a failure leading to \"loss of life or mission\", Thiokol would forfeit $10&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|10|1986|r=1|fmt=c}}{{nbsp}}million today) of its incentive fee and formally accept legal liability for the failure.

After the accident, NASA attempted to aim at a more realistic shuttle flight rate: it added another orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', to the space shuttle fleet to replace ''Challenger'', and it worked with the Department of Defense to put more satellites in orbit using [[expendable launch vehicle]]s rather than the shuttle.<ref name=\"rogerscommission\">{{cite web| author=Rogers Commission | title=Implementation of the Recommendations of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident, Recommendation VII|date=June 1987 | url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v6ch7.htm | accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref> In August 1986, President Reagan also announced that the shuttle would no longer carry commercial [[satellite]] payloads.<ref name=\"rogerscommission\" /> After a 32-month hiatus, the next shuttle mission, [[STS-26]], was launched on September 29, 1988.\n\nAlthough changes were made by NASA after the ''Challenger'' accident, many commentators have argued that the changes in its management structure and organizational culture were neither deep nor long-lasting.\n\nAfter the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' disaster]] in 2003, attention once again focused on the attitude of NASA management towards safety issues. The [[Columbia Accident Investigation Board]] (CAIB) concluded that NASA had failed to learn many of the lessons of ''Challenger''.

The shuttle had no individual ejection seats or a crew escape capsule.

To demonstrate this, he took all of the data he claimed the engineers had presented during the briefing, and reformatted it onto a single graph of O-ring damage versus external launch temperature, showing the effects of cold on the degree of O-ring damage. Tufte then placed the proposed launch of ''Challenger'' on the graph according to its predicted temperature at launch. According to Tufte, the launch temperature of ''Challenger'' was so far below the coldest launch, with the worst damage seen to date, that even a casual observer could have determined that the risk of disaster was severe.<ref>[[Edward Tufte]]. (1997) ''Visual Explanations'', {{ISBN|978-0-9613921-2-3}}, Chapter 2.</ref>\n\nTufte has also argued that poor presentation of information may have also affected NASA decisions during the last flight of the space shuttle ''[[Columbia disaster|Columbia]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001yB&topic_id=1|title= PowerPoint Does Rocket Science\u2014and Better Techniques for Technical Reports |accessdate=January 28, 2007 |author=Tufte, Edward}}</ref>\n\nBoisjoly, Wade Robison, a [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] professor, and their colleagues have vigorously repudiated Tufte's conclusions about the Morton-Thiokol engineers' role in the loss of ''Challenger''. First, they argue that the engineers didn't have the information available as Tufte claimed: \"But they did not know the temperatures even though they did try to obtain that information. Tufte has not gotten the facts right even though the information was available to him had he looked for it.\"<ref name=WadeNAE96>{{cite journal |author1=Robison, W. |author2=Boisjoly, R. |author3=Hoeker, D. |author4=Young, S. |last-author-amp=yes | year = 2002 | title = Representation and Misrepresentation: Tufte and the Morton Thiokol Engineers on the Challenger | journal = Science and Engineering Ethics | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 59\u201381 | url=https://people.rit.edu/wlrgsh/FINRobison.pdf |accessdate=November 9, 2016|doi=10.1007/s11948-002-0033-2 }} This reference is used by the Online Ethics Center for Engineering and Research of the National Academy of Engineering of the National Academies.</ref> They further argue that Tufte \"misunderstands thoroughly the argument and evidence the engineers gave.\"<ref name=WadeNAE96/> They also criticized Tufte's diagram as \"fatally flawed by Tufte's own criteria. The vertical axis tracks the wrong effect, and the horizontal axis cites temperatures not available to the engineers and, in addition, mixes O-ring temperatures and ambient air temperature as though the two were the same.\"<ref name=WadeNAE96/>\n\nThe ''Challenger'' disaster also provided a chance to see how traumatic events affected children's psyches. The large number of children who saw the accident live or in replays the same day was well known that day, and influenced the speech President Reagan gave that evening.\n\n{{Quote|text=I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who were watching the live coverage of the shuttle's takeoff. I know it is hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen. It's all part of the process of exploration and discovery. It's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons. The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we'll continue to follow them.|sign=|source=}}\n\nAt least one psychological study has found that memories of the ''Challenger'' explosion were similar to memories of experiencing single, unrepeated traumas. The majority of children's memories of ''Challenger'' were often clear and consistent, and even things like personal placement such as who they were with or what they were doing when they heard the news were remembered well. In one U.S. study, children's memories were recorded and tested again. Children on the East Coast recalled the event more easily than children on the West Coast, due to the time difference. Children on the East Coast either saw the explosion on TV while in school, or heard people talking about it. On the other side of the country, most children were either on their way to school, or just beginning their morning classes. Researchers found that those children who saw the explosion on TV had a more emotional connection to the event, and thus had an easier time remembering it. After one year the children's memories were tested, and those on the East Coast recalled the event better than their West Coast counterparts. Regardless of where they were when it happened, the ''Challenger'' explosion was still an important event that many children easily remembered.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Connect with us!|journal= The American Journal of Psychiatry|doi=10.1176/ajp.153.5.618|pmid=8615406|volume=153|issue=5|year=1996|pages=618\u201325 | last1 = Terr | first1 = LC | last2 = Bloch | first2 = DA | last3 = Michel | first3 = BA | last4 = Shi | first4 = H | last5 = Reinhardt | first5 = JA | last6 = Metayer | first6 = S}}</ref>\n\n===Continuation of the Shuttle program===\nAfter the accident, NASA's Space Shuttle fleet was grounded for almost three years while the investigation, hearings, engineering redesign of the SRBs, and other behind-the-scenes technical and management reviews, changes, and preparations were taking place. At 11:37 on September 29, 1988, [[Space Shuttle Discovery|Space Shuttle ''Discovery'']] lifted off with a crew of five, all veteran astronauts,<ref>{{cite web|author=John A.

Its crew included [[Richard O. Covey]], who had given the last status callout to ''Challenger'' before its breakup, \"Challenger, go at throttle up\". The shuttle carried a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, TDRS-C (named TDRS-3 after deployment), which replaced TDRS-B, the satellite that was launched and lost on ''Challenger''. The \"Return to Flight\" launch of ''Discovery'' also represented a test of the redesigned boosters, a shift to a more conservative stance on safety (being the first time the crew had launched in pressure suits since STS-4, the last of the four initial Shuttle test flights), and a chance to restore national pride in the American space program, especially crewed space flight. The mission, [[STS-26]], was a success (with only two minor system failures, one of a cabin cooling system and one of a Ku-band antenna), and a regular schedule of STS flights followed, continuing without extended interruption until the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|2003 ''Columbia'' disaster]].\n\n[[Barbara Morgan]], the backup for McAuliffe who trained with her in the Teacher in Space program and was at KSC watching her launch on January 28, 1986, flew on [[STS-118]] as a Mission Specialist in August 2007.\n\n=== Other civilian passenger plans ===\nNASA had intended to send a wide range of civilian passengers into space on subsequent flights. These plans were all scrapped immediately following the ''Challenger'' disaster.\n\nNBC News's Cape Canaveral correspondent [[Jay Barbree]] was among 40 candidates in NASA's Journalist in Space Program. The first journalist was due to fly on the shuttle ''Challenger'' in September 1986. In 1984, prior to establishing the Teacher in Space Program (TISP), NASA created the Space Flight Participant Program whose aim was \"to select teachers, journalists, artists, and other people who could bring their unique perspective to the human spaceflight experience as a passenger on the space shuttle.\"{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} Notable among early potential passengers was [[Caroll Spinney]] who, from 1969\u20132018, played the characters [[Big Bird]] and [[Oscar the Grouch]] on the children's television show ''[[Sesame Street]]''. In 2014, after the situation was mentioned in the documentary ''I Am Big Bird'', NASA confirmed the revelation, stating this:\n\n{{quote|A review of past documentation shows there were initial conversations with ''Sesame Street'' regarding their potential participation on a Challenger flight, but that plan was never approved.}}\n\nSpinney went on to say that the Big Bird costuming was prohibitive in the tight quarters of the NASA Space Shuttles and they had moved on.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/science/weird-science/nasa-confirms-talks-fly-big-bird-doomed-shuttle-challenger-n353521|title=NASA Confirms Talks to Fly Big Bird on Doomed Shuttle Challenger|website=NBC News|language=en|access-date=2019-01-30}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Challenger Memorial1.JPG|thumb|240px|The Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' Memorial in Arlington National Cemetery, where some remains were buried]]\n\nThe families of the ''Challenger'' crew organized the [[Challenger Center for Space Science Education]] as a permanent memorial to the crew.
