With the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in 1865 and the completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869, waves of new migrants and immigrants reached the Great Plains, and they greatly increased the acreage under cultivation.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.planning.org/25anniversary/planning/1987dec.htm | title = The Great Plains: from dust to dust | publisher = Planning Magazine | date = December 1987 | accessdate = December 6, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071006015832/http://www.planning.org/25anniversary/planning/1987dec.htm |archivedate = October 6, 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"Regions\">{{cite book | year =  1995 | url = http://www.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/uu14re/uu14re00.htm  | title = Regions at Risk: a comparison of threatened environments | publisher = United Nations University Press | accessdate = December 6, 2007}}</ref>  An unusually wet period in the Great Plains mistakenly led settlers and the federal government to believe that \"[[rain follows the plow]]\" (a popular phrase among real estate promoters) and that the climate of the region had changed permanently.<ref>{{cite book | year =  2006 | url = http://drought.unl.edu/DroughtBasics/DustBowl/DroughtintheDustBowlYears.aspx| title = Drought in the Dust Bowl Years | publisher = National Drought Mitigation Center | location = US | accessdate = December 6, 2007}}</ref>  While initial agricultural endeavors were primarily [[cattle ranch]]ing, the adverse effect of harsh winters on the cattle, beginning in 1886, a short drought in 1890, and general [[overgrazing]], led many landowners to increase the amount of land under cultivation.\n\nRecognizing the challenge of cultivating marginal arid land, the United States government expanded on the {{convert|160|acre}} offered under the Homestead Act \u2013 granting {{convert|640|acre}} to homesteaders in western Nebraska under the [[Kinkaid Act]] (1904) and {{convert|320|acres}} elsewhere in the Great Plains under the [[Enlarged Homestead Act of 1909]]. Waves of European settlers arrived in the plains at the beginning of the 20th century.  A return of unusually wet weather seemingly confirmed a previously held opinion that the \"formerly\" semiarid area could support large-scale agriculture. At the same time, technological improvements such as mechanized plowing and mechanized harvesting made it possible to operate larger properties without increasing labor costs.\n\nThe combined effects of the disruption of the [[Russian Revolution]], which decreased the supply of wheat and other commodity crops, and [[World War I]] increased agricultural prices; this demand encouraged farmers to dramatically increase cultivation.  For example, in the [[Llano Estacado]] of [[eastern New Mexico]] and northwestern [[Texas]], the area of farmland was doubled between 1900 and 1920, then tripled again between 1925 and 1930.<ref name=\"Regions\"/> The agricultural methods favored by farmers during this period created the conditions for large-scale [[erosion]] under certain environmental conditions.<ref name = drought />  The widespread conversion of the land by deep plowing and other soil preparation methods to enable agriculture eliminated the native grasses which held the soil in place and helped retain moisture during dry periods.  Furthermore, [[cotton]] farmers left fields bare during winter months, when winds in the High Plains are highest, and [[Stubble burning|burned]] the [[Crop residue|stubble]] as a means to control weeds prior to planting, thereby depriving the soil of organic nutrients and surface vegetation.\n\n==Drought and dust storms==\n[[File:Wea01422.jpg|thumb|A [[dust storm]]; [[Spearman, Texas|Spearman]], [[Texas]], April 14, 1935]]\n[[File:Dust bowl, Texas Panhandle, TX fsa.8b27276 edit.jpg|thumb|Heavy black clouds of dust rising over the Texas Panhandle, Texas, c. 1936]]\nAfter fairly favorable climatic conditions in the 1920s with good rainfall and relatively moderate winters,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/time-series/us/105/00/tavg/6/03/1895-2014?base_prd=true&firstbaseyear=1896&lastbaseyear=1967&trend=true&trend_base=10&firsttrendyear=1968&lasttrendyear=2014&filter=true&filterType=binomial|title=Northern Rockies and Plains Average Temperature \u2013 October to March|publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}</ref> which permitted increased settlement and cultivation in the Great Plains, the region entered an unusually dry era in the summer of 1930.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/time-series/us/105/00/pcp/12/12/1895-2013?base_prd=true&firstbaseyear=1895&lastbaseyear=1966&trend=true&trend_base=10&firsttrendyear=1967&lasttrendyear=2013&filter=true&filterType=binomial|title=Northern Rockies and Plains Precipitation, 1895\u20132013|publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}</ref> During the next decade, the northern plains suffered four of their seven driest calendar years since 1895, Kansas four of its twelve driest,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/time-series/us/14/00/pcp/12/12/1895-2013?base_prd=true&firstbaseyear=1895&lastbaseyear=1966&trend=true&trend_base=10&firsttrendyear=1967&lasttrendyear=2013&filter=true&filterType=binomial|title=Kansas Precipitation 1895 to 2013|publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}</ref> and the entire region south to West Texas<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/time-series/us/41/01/pcp/12/12/1895-2013?base_prd=true&firstbaseyear=1895&lastbaseyear=1966&trend=true&trend_base=10&firsttrendyear=1967&lasttrendyear=2013&filter=true&filterType=binomial|title=Texas Climate Division 1 (High Plains): Precipitation 1895\u20132013|publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}</ref> lacked any period of above-normal rainfall until record rains hit in 1941.<ref>{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.library.noaa.gov/docs.lib/htdocs/rescue/mwr/069/mwr-069-12-0360.pdf|title=The Weather of 1941 in the United States|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}</ref> When severe [[drought]] struck the Great Plains region in the 1930s, it resulted in erosion and loss of topsoil because of farming practices at the time.

Gregory examined Census Bureau statistics and other records to learn more about the migrants. Based on a 1939 survey of occupation by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics of about 116,000 families who arrived in California in the 1930s, he learned that only 43 percent of southwesterners were doing farm work immediately before they migrated.  Nearly one-third of all migrants were professional or white-collar workers.<ref>Gregory, N. James. (1991) ''American Exodus: The Dust Bowl Migration and Okie Culture in California.'' Oxford University Press.</ref> The poor economy displaced more than just farmers as refugees to California; many teachers, lawyers, and small business owners moved west with their families during this time.  After the Great Depression ended, some moved back to their original states. Many others remained where they had resettled. About one-eighth of California's population is of Okie heritage.<ref>Babb, et al. (2007), ''On the Dirty Plate Trail,'' p. 13</ref>\n\n==U.S. government response==\nThe greatly expanded participation of government in land management and soil conservation was an important outcome from the disaster. Different groups took many different approaches to responding to the disaster. To identify areas that needed attention, groups such as the [[Soil Conservation Service]] generated detailed soil maps and took photos of the land from the sky. To create shelterbelts to reduce soil erosion, groups such as the [[United States Forestry Service]]'s Prairie States Forestry Project planted trees on private lands. Finally, groups like the Resettlement Administration, which later became the [[Farm Security Administration]], encouraged small farm owners to resettle on other lands, if they lived in drier parts of the Plains.<ref name=\"whatwelearned\"/>\n\nDuring President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s first 100 days in office in 1933, his administration quickly initiated programs to [[Soil conservation|conserve soil]] and restore the ecological balance of the nation. Interior Secretary [[Harold L. Ickes]] established the Soil Erosion Service in August 1933 under [[Hugh Hammond Bennett]]. In 1935, it was transferred and reorganized under the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] and renamed the Soil Conservation Service.  It is now known as the [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]] (NRCS).<ref>Steiner, Frederick (2008). ''The Living Landscape, Second Edition: An Ecological Approach to Landscape Planning'', p. 188. Island Press. {{ISBN|1-59726-396-6}}.</ref>\n\nAs part of [[New Deal]] programs, Congress passed the [[Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act]] in 1936, requiring landowners to share the allocated government subsidies with the laborers who worked on their farms. Under the law, \"benefit payments were continued as measures for production control and income support, but they were now financed by direct Congressional appropriations and justified as soil conservation measures. The Act shifted the parity goal from price equality of agricultural commodities and the articles that farmers buy to income equality of farm and non-farm population.\"<ref>Rau, Allan. ''Agricultural Policy and Trade Liberalization in the United States, 1934\u20131956; a Study of Conflicting Policies''. Gen\u00e8ve: E. Droz, 1957. p. 81.</ref> Thus, the parity goal was to re-create the ratio between the purchasing power of the net income per person on farms from agriculture and that of the income of persons not on farms that prevailed during 1909\u20131914.\n\nTo stabilize prices, the government paid farmers and ordered more than six million pigs to be slaughtered. It paid to have the meat packed and distributed to the poor and hungry. The [[Federal Surplus Relief Corporation]] (FSRC) was established to regulate crop and other surpluses. FDR in an address on the AAA <!--Which AAA is this?-->commented,\n\n<blockquote>Let me make one other point clear for the benefit of the millions in cities who have to buy meats. Last year the Nation suffered a drought of unparalleled intensity. If there had been no Government program, if the old order had obtained in 1933 and 1934, that drought on the cattle ranges of America and in the corn belt would have resulted in the marketing of thin cattle, immature hogs and the death of these animals on the range and on the farm, and if the old order had been in effect those years, we would have had a vastly greater shortage than we face today. Our program \u2013 we can prove it \u2013 saved the lives of millions of head of livestock. They are still on the range, and other millions of heads are today canned and ready for this country to eat.</blockquote>\n\nThe FSRC diverted agricultural commodities to relief organizations.  Apples, beans, canned beef, flour and pork products were distributed through local relief channels.  Cotton goods were later included, to clothe the needy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/dustbowl/timeline/|title=The American Experience / Surviving the Dust Bowl / Timeline}}</ref>\n\nIn 1935, the federal government formed a [[Drought Relief Service]] (DRS) to coordinate relief activities.  The DRS bought cattle in counties which were designated emergency areas, for $14 to $20 a head.  Animals determined unfit for human consumption were killed; at the beginning of the program, more than 50 percent were so designated in emergency areas. The DRS assigned the remaining cattle to the Federal Surplus Relief Corporation (FSRC) to be used in food distribution to families nationwide.  Although it was difficult for farmers to give up their herds, the cattle slaughter program helped many of them avoid bankruptcy. \"The government cattle buying program was a blessing to many farmers, as they could not afford to keep their cattle, and the government paid a better price than they could obtain in local markets.\"<ref>''Monthly Catalog,'' United States Public Documents, By United States Superintendent of Documents, United States Government Printing Office, Published by the G.P.O., 1938</ref>\n\nPresident Roosevelt ordered the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] to plant the [[Great Plains Shelterbelt]], a huge belt of more than 200&nbsp;million trees from Canada to [[Abilene, Texas]] to break the wind, hold water in the soil, and hold the soil itself in place. The administration also began to educate farmers on [[soil conservation]] and anti-erosion techniques, including crop rotation, [[strip farming]], [[contour plowing]], terracing, and other improved farming practices.<ref>{{cite book|title=Texas|author=Federal Writers' Project|location=Writers' Program (Tex.)|publisher=Writers' Program Texas|page=16}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Chronicles of Oklahoma|first=James Shannon|last=Buchanan|publisher=Oklahoma Historical Society|page=224}}</ref>  In 1937, the federal government began an aggressive campaign to encourage farmers in the Dust Bowl to adopt planting and plowing methods that conserved the soil.  The government paid reluctant farmers a dollar an acre to practice the new methods.  By 1938, the massive conservation effort had reduced the amount of blowing soil by 65%.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/timeline/dustbowl/ PBS Timeline of Dust Bowl]</ref> The land still failed to yield a decent living.  In the fall of 1939, after nearly a decade of dirt and dust, the drought ended when regular rainfall finally returned to the region. The government still encouraged continuing the use of conservation methods to protect the soil and ecology of the Plains.\n\nAt the end of the drought, the programs which were implemented during these tough times helped to sustain a positive relationship between America's farmers and the federal government.<ref>''A Cultural History'' (1999),  p.45.</ref>\n\nThe President's Drought Committee issued a report in 1935 covering the government's assistance to agriculture during 1934 through mid-1935: it discussed conditions, measures of relief, organization, finances, operations, and results of the government's assistance.<ref>United States.

[[Land degradation]] varied widely. Aside from the short-term economic consequences caused by erosion, there were severe long-term economic consequences caused by the Dust Bowl.\n\nBy 1940, counties that had experienced the most significant levels of erosion had a greater decline in agricultural land values. The per-acre value of farmland declined by 28% in high-erosion counties and 17% in medium-erosion counties, relative to land value changes in low-erosion counties.<ref name=\"hornbeck\">{{cite journal |last=Hornbeck|first= Richard| title=The Enduring Impact of the American Dust Bowl: Short and Long-run Adjustments to Environmental Catastrophe |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |year=2012 |volume=102 |issue=4 |pages=1477\u20131507 |doi=10.1257/aer.102.4.1477 |url= http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:11303325}}</ref>{{rp|3}}  Even over the long-term, the agricultural value of the land often failed to recover to pre-Dust Bowl levels.  In highly eroded areas, less than 25% of the original agricultural losses were recovered.  The economy adjusted predominantly through large relative population declines in more-eroded counties, both during the 1930s and through the 1950s.<ref name=\"hornbeck2012\">{{citation| url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/hornbeck/files/hornbeck_dustbowl.pdf?m=1360041873 | title=The Enduring Impact of the American Dust Bowl: Short- and Long-Run Adjustments to Environmental Catastrophe | last=Hornbeck | first=Richard | date=June 2012 | via=Harvard University, Department of Economics | journal=American Economic Review | volume=102 | issue=4 | pages=1477\u20131507 | doi=10.1257/aer.102.4.1477 | format=PDF | access-date=March 31, 2016 | mode=cs1 }}</ref>{{rp|1500}}\n\nThe economic effects persisted, in part, because of farmers' failure to switch to more appropriate crops for highly eroded areas.  Because the amount of topsoil had been reduced, it would have been more productive to shift from crops and wheat to animals and hay.  During the Depression and through at least the 1950s, there was limited relative adjustment of farmland away from activities that became less productive in more-eroded counties.\n\nSome of the failure to shift to more productive agricultural products may be related to ignorance about the benefits of changing land use.  A second explanation is a lack of availability of credit, caused by the high rate of failure of banks in the Plains states.  Because banks failed in the Dust Bowl region at a higher rate than elsewhere, farmers could not get the credit they needed to buy capital to shift crop production.<ref>{{Cite journal| last= Landon-Lane|first= John| first2= Hugh |last2=Rockoff |first3=Richard |last3=Steckel |title=Droughts, Floods, and Financial Distress in the United States |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 15596 |page=6 |doi=10.3386/w15596 |date=December 2009 }}</ref> In addition, profit margins in either animals or hay were still minimal, and farmers had little incentive in the beginning to change their crops.\n\n[[Patrick Allitt]] recounts how fellow historian [[Donald Worster]] responded to his return visit to the Dust Bowl in the mid-1970s when he revisited some of the worst afflicted counties:\n:Capital-intensive agribusiness had transformed the scene; deep wells into the aquifer, intensive irrigation, the use of artificial pesticides and fertilizers, and giant harvesters were creating immense crops year after year whether it rained or not.  According to the farmers he interviewed, technology had provided the perfect answer to old troubles, such of the bad days would not return.  In Worster's view, by contrast, the scene demonstrated that America's capitalist high-tech farmers had learned nothing.  They  were continuing to work in an unsustainable way, devoting far cheaper subsidized energy to growing food than the energy could give back to its ultimate consumers.<ref>Patrick Allitt, ''A Climate of Crisis: America in the Age of Environmentalism'' (2014)  p 203</ref>\n\nIn contrast with Worster's pessimism, historian Mathew Bonnifield  argued that the long-term significance of the Dust Bowl was \"the triumph of the human spirit in its capacity to endure and overcome hardships and reverses.\"<ref>Allitt p 211, paraphrasing William Cronin's evaluation of Mathew Paul Bonnifield, ''Dust Bowl: Men, Dirt and Depression''(1979)</ref>\n\n==Influence on the arts and culture==\n[[File:Lange-MigrantMother02.jpg|thumb|[[Florence Owens Thompson]] seen in the photo ''Destitute Pea Pickers in California.

Waves of European settlers arrived in the plains at the beginning of the 20th century.  A return of unusually wet weather seemingly confirmed a previously held opinion that the \"formerly\" semiarid area could support large-scale agriculture. At the same time, technological improvements such as mechanized plowing and mechanized harvesting made it possible to operate larger properties without increasing labor costs.\n\nThe combined effects of the disruption of the [[Russian Revolution]], which decreased the supply of wheat and other commodity crops, and [[World War I]] increased agricultural prices; this demand encouraged farmers to dramatically increase cultivation.  For example, in the [[Llano Estacado]] of [[eastern New Mexico]] and northwestern [[Texas]], the area of farmland was doubled between 1900 and 1920, then tripled again between 1925 and 1930.<ref name=\"Regions\"/> The agricultural methods favored by farmers during this period created the conditions for large-scale [[erosion]] under certain environmental conditions.<ref name = drought />  The widespread conversion of the land by deep plowing and other soil preparation methods to enable agriculture eliminated the native grasses which held the soil in place and helped retain moisture during dry periods.  Furthermore, [[cotton]] farmers left fields bare during winter months, when winds in the High Plains are highest, and [[Stubble burning|burned]] the [[Crop residue|stubble]] as a means to control weeds prior to planting, thereby depriving the soil of organic nutrients and surface vegetation.\n\n==Drought and dust storms==\n[[File:Wea01422.jpg|thumb|A [[dust storm]]; [[Spearman, Texas|Spearman]], [[Texas]], April 14, 1935]]\n[[File:Dust bowl, Texas Panhandle, TX fsa.8b27276 edit.jpg|thumb|Heavy black clouds of dust rising over the Texas Panhandle, Texas, c. 1936]]\nAfter fairly favorable climatic conditions in the 1920s with good rainfall and relatively moderate winters,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/time-series/us/105/00/tavg/6/03/1895-2014?base_prd=true&firstbaseyear=1896&lastbaseyear=1967&trend=true&trend_base=10&firsttrendyear=1968&lasttrendyear=2014&filter=true&filterType=binomial|title=Northern Rockies and Plains Average Temperature \u2013 October to March|publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}</ref> which permitted increased settlement and cultivation in the Great Plains, the region entered an unusually dry era in the summer of 1930.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/time-series/us/105/00/pcp/12/12/1895-2013?base_prd=true&firstbaseyear=1895&lastbaseyear=1966&trend=true&trend_base=10&firsttrendyear=1967&lasttrendyear=2013&filter=true&filterType=binomial|title=Northern Rockies and Plains Precipitation, 1895\u20132013|publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}</ref> During the next decade, the northern plains suffered four of their seven driest calendar years since 1895, Kansas four of its twelve driest,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/time-series/us/14/00/pcp/12/12/1895-2013?base_prd=true&firstbaseyear=1895&lastbaseyear=1966&trend=true&trend_base=10&firsttrendyear=1967&lasttrendyear=2013&filter=true&filterType=binomial|title=Kansas Precipitation 1895 to 2013|publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}</ref> and the entire region south to West Texas<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/time-series/us/41/01/pcp/12/12/1895-2013?base_prd=true&firstbaseyear=1895&lastbaseyear=1966&trend=true&trend_base=10&firsttrendyear=1967&lasttrendyear=2013&filter=true&filterType=binomial|title=Texas Climate Division 1 (High Plains): Precipitation 1895\u20132013|publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}</ref> lacked any period of above-normal rainfall until record rains hit in 1941.<ref>{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.library.noaa.gov/docs.lib/htdocs/rescue/mwr/069/mwr-069-12-0360.pdf|title=The Weather of 1941 in the United States|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}</ref> When severe [[drought]] struck the Great Plains region in the 1930s, it resulted in erosion and loss of topsoil because of farming practices at the time.

Maricopa County, Arizona. Children in a democracy. A migra . . . - NARA - 522528.jpg|thumb|A migratory family from Texas living in a trailer in an Arizona cotton field]]\nHistorian James N. Gregory examined Census Bureau statistics and other records to learn more about the migrants. Based on a 1939 survey of occupation by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics of about 116,000 families who arrived in California in the 1930s, he learned that only 43 percent of southwesterners were doing farm work immediately before they migrated.  Nearly one-third of all migrants were professional or white-collar workers.<ref>Gregory, N. James. (1991) ''American Exodus: The Dust Bowl Migration and Okie Culture in California.'' Oxford University Press.</ref> The poor economy displaced more than just farmers as refugees to California; many teachers, lawyers, and small business owners moved west with their families during this time.  After the Great Depression ended, some moved back to their original states. Many others remained where they had resettled. About one-eighth of California's population is of Okie heritage.<ref>Babb, et al. (2007), ''On the Dirty Plate Trail,'' p. 13</ref>\n\n==U.S. government response==\nThe greatly expanded participation of government in land management and soil conservation was an important outcome from the disaster. Different groups took many different approaches to responding to the disaster. To identify areas that needed attention, groups such as the [[Soil Conservation Service]] generated detailed soil maps and took photos of the land from the sky. To create shelterbelts to reduce soil erosion, groups such as the [[United States Forestry Service]]'s Prairie States Forestry Project planted trees on private lands. Finally, groups like the Resettlement Administration, which later became the [[Farm Security Administration]], encouraged small farm owners to resettle on other lands, if they lived in drier parts of the Plains.<ref name=\"whatwelearned\"/>\n\nDuring President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s first 100 days in office in 1933, his administration quickly initiated programs to [[Soil conservation|conserve soil]] and restore the ecological balance of the nation. Interior Secretary [[Harold L. Ickes]] established the Soil Erosion Service in August 1933 under [[Hugh Hammond Bennett]]. In 1935, it was transferred and reorganized under the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] and renamed the Soil Conservation Service.  It is now known as the [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]] (NRCS).<ref>Steiner, Frederick (2008). ''The Living Landscape, Second Edition: An Ecological Approach to Landscape Planning'', p. 188. Island Press. {{ISBN|1-59726-396-6}}.</ref>\n\nAs part of [[New Deal]] programs, Congress passed the [[Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act]] in 1936, requiring landowners to share the allocated government subsidies with the laborers who worked on their farms. Under the law, \"benefit payments were continued as measures for production control and income support, but they were now financed by direct Congressional appropriations and justified as soil conservation measures. The Act shifted the parity goal from price equality of agricultural commodities and the articles that farmers buy to income equality of farm and non-farm population.\"<ref>Rau, Allan. ''Agricultural Policy and Trade Liberalization in the United States, 1934\u20131956; a Study of Conflicting Policies''. Gen\u00e8ve: E. Droz, 1957. p. 81.</ref> Thus, the parity goal was to re-create the ratio between the purchasing power of the net income per person on farms from agriculture and that of the income of persons not on farms that prevailed during 1909\u20131914.\n\nTo stabilize prices, the government paid farmers and ordered more than six million pigs to be slaughtered. It paid to have the meat packed and distributed to the poor and hungry. The [[Federal Surplus Relief Corporation]] (FSRC) was established to regulate crop and other surpluses. FDR in an address on the AAA <!--Which AAA is this?-->commented,\n\n<blockquote>Let me make one other point clear for the benefit of the millions in cities who have to buy meats. Last year the Nation suffered a drought of unparalleled intensity. If there had been no Government program, if the old order had obtained in 1933 and 1934, that drought on the cattle ranges of America and in the corn belt would have resulted in the marketing of thin cattle, immature hogs and the death of these animals on the range and on the farm, and if the old order had been in effect those years, we would have had a vastly greater shortage than we face today. Our program \u2013 we can prove it \u2013 saved the lives of millions of head of livestock. They are still on the range, and other millions of heads are today canned and ready for this country to eat.</blockquote>\n\nThe FSRC diverted agricultural commodities to relief organizations.  Apples, beans, canned beef, flour and pork products were distributed through local relief channels.  Cotton goods were later included, to clothe the needy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/dustbowl/timeline/|title=The American Experience / Surviving the Dust Bowl / Timeline}}</ref>\n\nIn 1935, the federal government formed a [[Drought Relief Service]] (DRS) to coordinate relief activities.  The DRS bought cattle in counties which were designated emergency areas, for $14 to $20 a head.  Animals determined unfit for human consumption were killed; at the beginning of the program, more than 50 percent were so designated in emergency areas. The DRS assigned the remaining cattle to the Federal Surplus Relief Corporation (FSRC) to be used in food distribution to families nationwide.  Although it was difficult for farmers to give up their herds, the cattle slaughter program helped many of them avoid bankruptcy. \"The government cattle buying program was a blessing to many farmers, as they could not afford to keep their cattle, and the government paid a better price than they could obtain in local markets.\"<ref>''Monthly Catalog,'' United States Public Documents, By United States Superintendent of Documents, United States Government Printing Office, Published by the G.P.O., 1938</ref>\n\nPresident Roosevelt ordered the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] to plant the [[Great Plains Shelterbelt]], a huge belt of more than 200&nbsp;million trees from Canada to [[Abilene, Texas]] to break the wind, hold water in the soil, and hold the soil itself in place. The administration also began to educate farmers on [[soil conservation]] and anti-erosion techniques, including crop rotation, [[strip farming]], [[contour plowing]], terracing, and other improved farming practices.<ref>{{cite book|title=Texas|author=Federal Writers' Project|location=Writers' Program (Tex.)|publisher=Writers' Program Texas|page=16}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Chronicles of Oklahoma|first=James Shannon|last=Buchanan|publisher=Oklahoma Historical Society|page=224}}</ref>  In 1937, the federal government began an aggressive campaign to encourage farmers in the Dust Bowl to adopt planting and plowing methods that conserved the soil.  The government paid reluctant farmers a dollar an acre to practice the new methods.  By 1938, the massive conservation effort had reduced the amount of blowing soil by 65%.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/timeline/dustbowl/ PBS Timeline of Dust Bowl]</ref> The land still failed to yield a decent living.  In the fall of 1939, after nearly a decade of dirt and dust, the drought ended when regular rainfall finally returned to the region. The government still encouraged continuing the use of conservation methods to protect the soil and ecology of the Plains.\n\nAt the end of the drought, the programs which were implemented during these tough times helped to sustain a positive relationship between America's farmers and the federal government.<ref>''A Cultural History'' (1999),  p.45.</ref>\n\nThe President's Drought Committee issued a report in 1935 covering the government's assistance to agriculture during 1934 through mid-1935: it discussed conditions, measures of relief, organization, finances, operations, and results of the government's assistance.<ref>United States.

[[Land degradation]] varied widely. Aside from the short-term economic consequences caused by erosion, there were severe long-term economic consequences caused by the Dust Bowl.\n\nBy 1940, counties that had experienced the most significant levels of erosion had a greater decline in agricultural land values. The per-acre value of farmland declined by 28% in high-erosion counties and 17% in medium-erosion counties, relative to land value changes in low-erosion counties.<ref name=\"hornbeck\">{{cite journal |last=Hornbeck|first= Richard| title=The Enduring Impact of the American Dust Bowl: Short and Long-run Adjustments to Environmental Catastrophe |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |year=2012 |volume=102 |issue=4 |pages=1477\u20131507 |doi=10.1257/aer.102.4.1477 |url= http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:11303325}}</ref>{{rp|3}}  Even over the long-term, the agricultural value of the land often failed to recover to pre-Dust Bowl levels.  In highly eroded areas, less than 25% of the original agricultural losses were recovered.  The economy adjusted predominantly through large relative population declines in more-eroded counties, both during the 1930s and through the 1950s.<ref name=\"hornbeck2012\">{{citation| url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/hornbeck/files/hornbeck_dustbowl.pdf?m=1360041873 | title=The Enduring Impact of the American Dust Bowl: Short- and Long-Run Adjustments to Environmental Catastrophe | last=Hornbeck | first=Richard | date=June 2012 | via=Harvard University, Department of Economics | journal=American Economic Review | volume=102 | issue=4 | pages=1477\u20131507 | doi=10.1257/aer.102.4.1477 | format=PDF | access-date=March 31, 2016 | mode=cs1 }}</ref>{{rp|1500}}\n\nThe economic effects persisted, in part, because of farmers' failure to switch to more appropriate crops for highly eroded areas.  Because the amount of topsoil had been reduced, it would have been more productive to shift from crops and wheat to animals and hay.  During the Depression and through at least the 1950s, there was limited relative adjustment of farmland away from activities that became less productive in more-eroded counties.\n\nSome of the failure to shift to more productive agricultural products may be related to ignorance about the benefits of changing land use.  A second explanation is a lack of availability of credit, caused by the high rate of failure of banks in the Plains states.  Because banks failed in the Dust Bowl region at a higher rate than elsewhere, farmers could not get the credit they needed to buy capital to shift crop production.<ref>{{Cite journal| last= Landon-Lane|first= John| first2= Hugh |last2=Rockoff |first3=Richard |last3=Steckel |title=Droughts, Floods, and Financial Distress in the United States |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 15596 |page=6 |doi=10.3386/w15596 |date=December 2009 }}</ref> In addition, profit margins in either animals or hay were still minimal, and farmers had little incentive in the beginning to change their crops.\n\n[[Patrick Allitt]] recounts how fellow historian [[Donald Worster]] responded to his return visit to the Dust Bowl in the mid-1970s when he revisited some of the worst afflicted counties:\n:Capital-intensive agribusiness had transformed the scene; deep wells into the aquifer, intensive irrigation, the use of artificial pesticides and fertilizers, and giant harvesters were creating immense crops year after year whether it rained or not.  According to the farmers he interviewed, technology had provided the perfect answer to old troubles, such of the bad days would not return.  In Worster's view, by contrast, the scene demonstrated that America's capitalist high-tech farmers had learned nothing.  They  were continuing to work in an unsustainable way, devoting far cheaper subsidized energy to growing food than the energy could give back to its ultimate consumers.<ref>Patrick Allitt, ''A Climate of Crisis: America in the Age of Environmentalism'' (2014)  p 203</ref>\n\nIn contrast with Worster's pessimism, historian Mathew Bonnifield  argued that the long-term significance of the Dust Bowl was \"the triumph of the human spirit in its capacity to endure and overcome hardships and reverses.\"<ref>Allitt p 211, paraphrasing William Cronin's evaluation of Mathew Paul Bonnifield, ''Dust Bowl: Men, Dirt and Depression''(1979)</ref>\n\n==Influence on the arts and culture==\n[[File:Lange-MigrantMother02.jpg|thumb|[[Florence Owens Thompson]] seen in the photo ''Destitute Pea Pickers in California.

It is given by the following formula: BMI equals a person's weight (mass) in kilograms divided by the square of the person's height in metres. The units therefore are kg/m<sup>2</sup> but BMI measures are typically used and written without units.\n\n:BMI provides a significantly more accurate representation of body fat content than simply measuring a person's weight. It is only moderately correlated with both body fat percentage and body fat mass ([[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|R<sup>2</sup>]] of 0.68).<ref>{{cite journal|title=Use of relative weight and Body Mass Index for the determination of adiposity |last1=Gray |first1=D.

There has been an acceptance in recent years that abdominal fat and weight around the abdomen constitute a greater health risk.<ref>{{cite web |last=Craver |first=R. |date=10 September 2008 |url=http://www.wakehealth.edu/Gerontology-and-Geriatrics/Location,-not-volume,-of-fat-found-to-be-key.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515223636/http://www.wakehealth.edu/Gerontology-and-Geriatrics/Location,-not-volume,-of-fat-found-to-be-key.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 May 2013 |title=Location, not volume, of fat found to be key |publisher=Journalnow.com |accessdate=2008-10-09 }}</ref>\n*[[weighing scale|Simple weighing]]\n:A person's weight is measured and compared to an estimated ideal weight. This is the easiest and most common method, but by far the least accurate, as it only measures one quantity (weight) and often does not take into account many factors such as height, [[body type]], and relative amount of [[muscle]] mass.\n*Skinfold [[caliper]]s or \"pinch test\"\n:The skin at several specific points on the body is pinched and the thickness of the resulting fold is measured.  This measures the thickness of the layers of fat located under the skin, from which a general measurement of total amount of fat in the body is calculated.  This method can be reasonably accurate for many people, but it assumes particular fat distribution patterns over the body\u2014which may not apply to all individuals, and does not account for fat deposits not directly under the skin.  Also, as the measurement and analysis generally involves a high degree of practice and interpretation, an accurate result requires that a professional perform it. It cannot generally be done by patients themselves.\n*[[Bioelectrical impedance analysis]]\n:A small electric current is passed through the body to measure its [[electrical resistance]]. As fat and muscle conduct electricity differently, this method can provide a direct measurement of the body fat percentage, in relation to muscle mass. In the past, this technique could only be performed reliably by trained professionals with specialized equipment, but it is now possible to buy home testing kits that let people do this themselves with a minimum of training.  Despite the improved simplicity of this process over the years, however, a number of factors can affect the results, including [[Fluid replacement|hydration]] and [[body temperature]], so it still needs some care when taking the test to ensure that the results are accurate.\n*[[hydrostatic equilibrium|Hydrostatic]] weighing\n:Considered one of the more accurate methods of measuring body fat, this technique involves complete submersion of a person in water, with special equipment to measure the person's weight while submerged. This weight is then compared with \"dry weight\" as recorded outside the water to determine overall body density. As fat is less dense than muscle, careful application of this technique can provide a reasonably close estimate of fat content in the body.  This technique does, however, require expensive specialized equipment and trained professionals to administer it properly.\n*[[Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry]] (DEXA)\n:Originally developed to measure bone density, DEXA imaging is also used to precisely determine body fat content by using the density of various body tissues to identify which portions of the body are fat. This test is generally considered very accurate, but requires a great deal of expensive medical equipment and trained professionals to perform.\n\nThe most common method for discussing this subject and the one used primarily by researchers and advisory institutions is BMI. Definitions of what is considered overweight vary by ethnicity. The current definition proposed by the US [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) designates whites, Hispanics and blacks with a BMI of 25 or more as overweight. For Asians, overweight is a BMI between 23 and 29.9 and obesity for all groups is a BMI of 30 or more.\n\nBMI, however, does not account extremes of muscle mass, some rare [[genetics|genetic]] factors, the very young, and a few other individual variations.  Thus it is possible for an individuals with a BMI of less than 25 to have excess body fat, while others may have a BMI that is significantly higher without falling into this category.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Dympna |last1=Gallagher |first2=S.

It is given by the following formula: BMI equals a person's weight (mass) in kilograms divided by the square of the person's height in metres. The units therefore are kg/m<sup>2</sup> but BMI measures are typically used and written without units.\n\n:BMI provides a significantly more accurate representation of body fat content than simply measuring a person's weight. It is only moderately correlated with both body fat percentage and body fat mass ([[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|R<sup>2</sup>]] of 0.68).<ref>{{cite journal|title=Use of relative weight and Body Mass Index for the determination of adiposity |last1=Gray |first1=D.

There has been an acceptance in recent years that abdominal fat and weight around the abdomen constitute a greater health risk.<ref>{{cite web |last=Craver |first=R. |date=10 September 2008 |url=http://www.wakehealth.edu/Gerontology-and-Geriatrics/Location,-not-volume,-of-fat-found-to-be-key.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515223636/http://www.wakehealth.edu/Gerontology-and-Geriatrics/Location,-not-volume,-of-fat-found-to-be-key.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 May 2013 |title=Location, not volume, of fat found to be key |publisher=Journalnow.com |accessdate=2008-10-09 }}</ref>\n*[[weighing scale|Simple weighing]]\n:A person's weight is measured and compared to an estimated ideal weight. This is the easiest and most common method, but by far the least accurate, as it only measures one quantity (weight) and often does not take into account many factors such as height, [[body type]], and relative amount of [[muscle]] mass.\n*Skinfold [[caliper]]s or \"pinch test\"\n:The skin at several specific points on the body is pinched and the thickness of the resulting fold is measured.  This measures the thickness of the layers of fat located under the skin, from which a general measurement of total amount of fat in the body is calculated.  This method can be reasonably accurate for many people, but it assumes particular fat distribution patterns over the body\u2014which may not apply to all individuals, and does not account for fat deposits not directly under the skin.  Also, as the measurement and analysis generally involves a high degree of practice and interpretation, an accurate result requires that a professional perform it. It cannot generally be done by patients themselves.\n*[[Bioelectrical impedance analysis]]\n:A small electric current is passed through the body to measure its [[electrical resistance]]. As fat and muscle conduct electricity differently, this method can provide a direct measurement of the body fat percentage, in relation to muscle mass. In the past, this technique could only be performed reliably by trained professionals with specialized equipment, but it is now possible to buy home testing kits that let people do this themselves with a minimum of training.  Despite the improved simplicity of this process over the years, however, a number of factors can affect the results, including [[Fluid replacement|hydration]] and [[body temperature]], so it still needs some care when taking the test to ensure that the results are accurate.\n*[[hydrostatic equilibrium|Hydrostatic]] weighing\n:Considered one of the more accurate methods of measuring body fat, this technique involves complete submersion of a person in water, with special equipment to measure the person's weight while submerged. This weight is then compared with \"dry weight\" as recorded outside the water to determine overall body density. As fat is less dense than muscle, careful application of this technique can provide a reasonably close estimate of fat content in the body.  This technique does, however, require expensive specialized equipment and trained professionals to administer it properly.\n*[[Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry]] (DEXA)\n:Originally developed to measure bone density, DEXA imaging is also used to precisely determine body fat content by using the density of various body tissues to identify which portions of the body are fat. This test is generally considered very accurate, but requires a great deal of expensive medical equipment and trained professionals to perform.\n\nThe most common method for discussing this subject and the one used primarily by researchers and advisory institutions is BMI. Definitions of what is considered overweight vary by ethnicity. The current definition proposed by the US [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) designates whites, Hispanics and blacks with a BMI of 25 or more as overweight. For Asians, overweight is a BMI between 23 and 29.9 and obesity for all groups is a BMI of 30 or more.\n\nBMI, however, does not account extremes of muscle mass, some rare [[genetics|genetic]] factors, the very young, and a few other individual variations.  Thus it is possible for an individuals with a BMI of less than 25 to have excess body fat, while others may have a BMI that is significantly higher without falling into this category.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Dympna |last1=Gallagher |first2=S.

H. Lawrence]] called it a \"perfect work of the American imagination\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Hugues Merle - The Scarlet Letter - Walters 37172.jpg|thumb|In this painting, ''The Scarlet Letter'' by [[Hugues Merle]], Hester Prynne and Pearl are in the foreground and Arthur Dimmesdale and Roger Chillingworth are in the background (painting by [[Hugues Merle]], 1861).]]\n\n\n\nThe Reverend John Wilson and the minister of Hester's church, Arthur Dimmesdale, question the woman, but she refuses to name her lover. After she returns to her prison cell, the jailer brings in Roger Chillingworth, a physician, to calm Hester and her child with his roots and herbs. He and Hester have an open conversation regarding their marriage and the fact that they were both in the wrong. Her lover, however, is another matter and he demands to know who it is; Hester refuses to divulge such information. He accepts this, stating that he will find out anyway, and forces her to hide that he is her husband. If she ever reveals him, he warns her, he will destroy the child's father. Hester agrees to Chillingworth's terms although she suspects she will regret it.\n\nFollowing her release from prison, Hester settles in a cottage at the edge of town and earns a meager living with her needlework, which is of extraordinary quality. She lives a quiet, somber life with her daughter, Pearl, and performs acts of charity for the poor. She is troubled by her daughter's unusual fascination with Hester's scarlet \"A\". The shunning of Hester also extends to Pearl, who has no playmates or friends except her mother. As she grows older, Pearl becomes capricious and unruly. Her conduct starts rumors, and, not surprisingly, the church members suggest Pearl be taken away from Hester.\n\nHester, hearing rumors that she may lose Pearl, goes to speak to Governor Bellingham. With him are ministers Wilson and Dimmesdale. Hester appeals to Dimmesdale in desperation, and the minister persuades the governor to let Pearl remain in Hester's care.\n\nBecause Dimmesdale's health has begun to fail, the townspeople are happy to have Chillingworth, a newly arrived physician, take up lodgings with their beloved minister. Being in such close contact with Dimmesdale, Chillingworth begins to suspect that the minister's illness is the result of some unconfessed guilt. He applies psychological pressure to the minister because he suspects Dimmesdale is Pearl's father. One evening, pulling the sleeping Dimmesdale's vestment aside, Chillingworth sees a symbol that represents his shame on the minister's pale chest.\n\nTormented by his guilty conscience, Dimmesdale goes to the square where Hester was punished years earlier. Climbing the scaffold, he admits his guilt but cannot find the courage to do so publicly. Hester, shocked by Dimmesdale's deterioration, decides to obtain a release from her vow of silence to her husband.\n\nSeveral days later, Hester meets Dimmesdale in the forest and tells him of her husband and his desire for revenge. She convinces Dimmesdale to leave Boston in secret on a ship to Europe where they can start life anew. Renewed by this plan, the minister seems to gain new energy.\nOn Election Day, Dimmesdale gives what is called one of his most inspired sermons. But as the procession leaves the church, Dimmesdale climbs upon the scaffold and confesses his sin, dying in Hester's arms. Later, most witnesses swear that they saw a stigma in the form of a scarlet \"A\" upon his chest, although some deny this statement. Chillingworth, losing his will for revenge, dies shortly thereafter and leaves Pearl a substantial inheritance.\n\nAfter several years, Hester returns to her cottage and resumes wearing the scarlet letter. When she dies, she is buried near the grave of Dimmesdale, and they share a simple slate tombstone engraved with an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] described as: \"On a field, [[sable (heraldry)|sable]], the letter A, [[gules]]\" (\"A red letter A written on a black background\").\n\n==Major theme==\n{{Original research section|date=December 2017}}\nThe major theme of ''The Scarlet Letter'' is shaming and social stigmatizing, both Hester's public humiliation and Dimmesdale's private shame and fear of exposure. Notably, their liaison is never spoken of, so the circumstances that lead to Hester's pregnancy, and how their affair was kept secret never become part of the plot.\n\nElmer Kennedy-Andrews remarks that Hawthorne in \"The Custom-house\" sets the context for his story and \"tells us about 'romance', which is his preferred generic term to describe ''The Scarlet Letter'', as his subtitle for the book&nbsp;\u2013 'A Romance'&nbsp;\u2013 would indicate.\" In this introduction, Hawthorne describes a space between materialism and \"dreaminess\" that he calls \"a neutral territory, somewhere between the real world and fairy-land, where the Actual and the Imaginary may meet, and each imbues itself with nature of the other\". This combination of \"dreaminess\" and realism gave the author space to explore major themes.{{sfnb|Kennedy-Andrews|1999|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=dz6nB-LiqyoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=romance&f=false 8\u20139]}}\n\n===Other themes===\nThe experience of Hester and Dimmesdale recalls the story of [[Adam and Eve]] because, in both cases, sin results in expulsion and suffering. But it also results in knowledge \u2013 specifically, in knowledge of what it means to be immoral. For Hester, the Scarlet Letter is a physical manifestation of her sin and reminder of her painful solitude. She contemplates casting it off to obtain her freedom from an oppressive society and a checkered past as well as the absence of God. Because the society excludes her, she considers the possibility that many of the traditions upheld by the Puritan culture are untrue and are not designed to bring her happiness.\n\nAs for Dimmesdale, the \"cheating minister\", his sin gives him \"sympathies so intimate with the sinful brotherhood of mankind, so that his chest vibrate[s] in unison with theirs.\" His eloquent and powerful sermons derive from this sense of empathy.<ref name=\"sparknotes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/scarlet/ |title=The Scarlet Letter |publisher=Sparknotes |date= |accessdate=2012-08-07}}</ref> The narrative of the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale is quite in keeping with the oldest and most fully authorized principles in [[Christian thought]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} His \"Fall\" is a descent from apparent grace to his own damnation; he appears to begin in purity but he ends in corruption. The subtlety is that the minister's belief is his own cheating, convincing himself at every stage of his spiritual [[pilgrimage]] that he is saved.<ref>Davidson, E.H. 1963. Dimmesdale's Fall. ''The New England Quarterly'' '''36''': 358\u2013370</ref>\n\nThe rose bush's beauty forms a striking contrast to all that surrounds it; as later the beautifully embroidered scarlet \"A\" will be held out in part as an invitation to find \"some sweet moral blossom\" in the ensuing, tragic tale and in part as an image that \"the deep heart of nature\" (perhaps God) may look more kindly on the errant Hester and her child than her Puritan neighbors do. Throughout the work, the nature images contrast with the stark darkness of the Puritans and their systems.<ref name=\"yahoo\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070308211539/http://education.yahoo.com/homework_help/cliffsnotes/the_scarlet_letter/ ''The Scarlet Letter'' by Nathaniel Hawthorne], CliffNotes from Yahoo! Education</ref>\n\nChillingworth's misshapen body reflects (or symbolizes) the anger in his soul, which builds as the novel progresses, similar to the way Dimmesdale's illness reveals his inner turmoil. The outward man reflects the condition of the heart; an observation thought inspired by the deterioration of [[Edgar Allan Poe]], whom Hawthorne \"much admired\".<ref name=\"yahoo\"/>\n\nAnother theme is the extreme legalism of the Puritans and how Hester chooses not to conform to their rules and beliefs. Hester was rejected by the villagers even though she spent her life doing what she could to help the sick and the poor. Because of the social [[shunning]], she spent her life mostly in solitude and would not go to church.\n\nAs a result, she retreats into her own mind and her own thinking. Her thoughts begin to stretch and go beyond what would be considered by the Puritans as safe. She still sees her sin, but begins to look on it differently than the villagers ever have. She begins to believe that a person's earthly sins do not necessarily condemn them. She even goes so far as to tell Dimmesdale that their sin has been paid for by their daily penance and that their sin will not keep them from getting to heaven, although the Puritans believed that such a sin surely condemns.{{dubious|date=December 2017}}{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nBut Hester had been alienated from the Puritan society, both in her physical life and spiritual life. When Dimmesdale dies, she knows she has to move on because she can no longer conform to the Puritans' strictness. Her thinking is free from puritan religious bounds and she has established her own different moral standards and beliefs.<ref name=\"sparknotes\"/>\n\n==Publication history==\n[[File:Hester Prynne.jpg|thumb|Hester Prynne at the [[stocks]], an engraved illustration from an 1878 edition]]\n\nIt was long thought that Hawthorne originally planned ''The Scarlet Letter'' to be a shorter [[Novella|novelette]], part of a collection named ''Old Time Legends'', and that his publisher, [[James Thomas Fields]], convinced him to expand the work to a full-length novel.<ref>Charvat, William.

However, as time progresses, the meaning of the letter changed. It now represented, to some, able. It states \u201cThe letter was the symbol of her calling. Such helpfulness was found in her\u2014so much power to do, and power to sympathize\u2014that many people refused to interpret the scarlet A by its original signification. They said that it meant Able, so strong was Hester Prynne, with a woman's strength\u201d (129).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-scarlet-letter-nathaniel-hawthorne/1116620656?ean=9781593082079#/|title=The Scarlet Letter (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)|last=Noble|first=Barnes &|website=Barnes & Noble|language=en|access-date=2018-06-04}}</ref>\n* '''Meteor:''' The meteor shaped as an A serves as another symbol in the book. To Reverend Dimmesdale the meteor is a sign from God who is revealing his sin to everyone and causes him to be ridden with guilt. However, others perceived the letter to be a symbol for angel.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* '''Dimmesdale's name:''' Dimmesdale's name itself also holds symbolism. His name contains the root word \"dim\" which evokes the feeling of faint, weak, and gloom. This represents the constant state Dimmesdale finds himself in. His life has dimmed itself ever since his sin, causing his light of life to fade and dim.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* '''Pearl''': Pearl symbolizes the embodiment of her parent's sin and passion. She is a constant reminder of the sin from which her mother cannot escape. It is mentioned she \"was the scarlet letter in another form; the scarlet letter endowed in life\u201d (84).<ref name=\":0\" />\n* '''Rosebush:''' The rosebush is mentioned twice within the course of the story.

The rosebush is perceived as a symbol of brightness in a story filled with human sorrow.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* '''The Scaffold''': The scaffold is mentioned three times throughout the novel. It can be viewed as separating the book into the beginning, middle, and end. It symbolizes shame, revelation of sin, and guilt for it is where Hester received her scarlet letter as punishment and where Dimmesdale experiences his revelation through the meteor.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Adaptations and influence==\n{{Main|The Scarlet Letter in popular culture}}\n''The Scarlet Letter'' has inspired numerous film, television, and stage adaptations, and plot elements have influenced several novels, musical works, and screen productions.\n\nIn March 2015, Manga Classics Inc. published a manga adaptation of ''The Scarlet Letter'', was adopted by Crystal S.

She is required to wear a scarlet \"A\" on her dress when she is in front of the townspeople to shame her. The letter \"A\" stands for adulteress, although this is never said explicitly in the novel. Her sentence required her to stand on the scaffold for three hours, exposed to [[public humiliation]], and to wear the scarlet \"A\" for the rest of her life. As Hester approaches the [[scaffold]], many of the women in the crowd are angered by her beauty and quiet dignity. When demanded and cajoled to name the father of her child, Hester refuses.\n\nAs Hester looks out over the crowd, she notices a small, misshapen man and recognizes him as her long-lost husband, who has been presumed lost at sea. When the husband sees Hester's shame, he asks a man in the crowd about her and is told the story of his wife's adultery. He angrily exclaims that the child's father, the partner in the adulterous act, should also be punished and vows to find the man. He chooses a new name, Roger Chillingworth, to aid him in his plan.\n\nThe Reverend John Wilson and the minister of Hester's church, Arthur Dimmesdale, question the woman, but she refuses to name her lover. After she returns to her prison cell, the jailer brings in Roger Chillingworth, a physician, to calm Hester and her child with his roots and herbs. He and Hester have an open conversation regarding their marriage and the fact that they were both in the wrong. Her lover, however, is another matter and he demands to know who it is; Hester refuses to divulge such information. He accepts this, stating that he will find out anyway, and forces her to hide that he is her husband. If she ever reveals him, he warns her, he will destroy the child's father. Hester agrees to Chillingworth's terms although she suspects she will regret it.\n\nFollowing her release from prison, Hester settles in a cottage at the edge of town and earns a meager living with her needlework, which is of extraordinary quality. She lives a quiet, somber life with her daughter, Pearl, and performs acts of charity for the poor. She is troubled by her daughter's unusual fascination with Hester's scarlet \"A\". The shunning of Hester also extends to Pearl, who has no playmates or friends except her mother. As she grows older, Pearl becomes capricious and unruly. Her conduct starts rumors, and, not surprisingly, the church members suggest Pearl be taken away from Hester.\n\nHester, hearing rumors that she may lose Pearl, goes to speak to Governor Bellingham. With him are ministers Wilson and Dimmesdale. Hester appeals to Dimmesdale in desperation, and the minister persuades the governor to let Pearl remain in Hester's care.\n\nBecause Dimmesdale's health has begun to fail, the townspeople are happy to have Chillingworth, a newly arrived physician, take up lodgings with their beloved minister. Being in such close contact with Dimmesdale, Chillingworth begins to suspect that the minister's illness is the result of some unconfessed guilt. He applies psychological pressure to the minister because he suspects Dimmesdale is Pearl's father. One evening, pulling the sleeping Dimmesdale's vestment aside, Chillingworth sees a symbol that represents his shame on the minister's pale chest.\n\nTormented by his guilty conscience, Dimmesdale goes to the square where Hester was punished years earlier. Climbing the scaffold, he admits his guilt but cannot find the courage to do so publicly. Hester, shocked by Dimmesdale's deterioration, decides to obtain a release from her vow of silence to her husband.\n\nSeveral days later, Hester meets Dimmesdale in the forest and tells him of her husband and his desire for revenge. She convinces Dimmesdale to leave Boston in secret on a ship to Europe where they can start life anew. Renewed by this plan, the minister seems to gain new energy.\nOn Election Day, Dimmesdale gives what is called one of his most inspired sermons. But as the procession leaves the church, Dimmesdale climbs upon the scaffold and confesses his sin, dying in Hester's arms. Later, most witnesses swear that they saw a stigma in the form of a scarlet \"A\" upon his chest, although some deny this statement. Chillingworth, losing his will for revenge, dies shortly thereafter and leaves Pearl a substantial inheritance.\n\nAfter several years, Hester returns to her cottage and resumes wearing the scarlet letter. When she dies, she is buried near the grave of Dimmesdale, and they share a simple slate tombstone engraved with an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] described as: \"On a field, [[sable (heraldry)|sable]], the letter A, [[gules]]\" (\"A red letter A written on a black background\").\n\n==Major theme==\n{{Original research section|date=December 2017}}\nThe major theme of ''The Scarlet Letter'' is shaming and social stigmatizing, both Hester's public humiliation and Dimmesdale's private shame and fear of exposure. Notably, their liaison is never spoken of, so the circumstances that lead to Hester's pregnancy, and how their affair was kept secret never become part of the plot.\n\nElmer Kennedy-Andrews remarks that Hawthorne in \"The Custom-house\" sets the context for his story and \"tells us about 'romance', which is his preferred generic term to describe ''The Scarlet Letter'', as his subtitle for the book&nbsp;\u2013 'A Romance'&nbsp;\u2013 would indicate.\" In this introduction, Hawthorne describes a space between materialism and \"dreaminess\" that he calls \"a neutral territory, somewhere between the real world and fairy-land, where the Actual and the Imaginary may meet, and each imbues itself with nature of the other\". This combination of \"dreaminess\" and realism gave the author space to explore major themes.{{sfnb|Kennedy-Andrews|1999|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=dz6nB-LiqyoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=romance&f=false 8\u20139]}}\n\n===Other themes===\nThe experience of Hester and Dimmesdale recalls the story of [[Adam and Eve]] because, in both cases, sin results in expulsion and suffering. But it also results in knowledge \u2013 specifically, in knowledge of what it means to be immoral. For Hester, the Scarlet Letter is a physical manifestation of her sin and reminder of her painful solitude. She contemplates casting it off to obtain her freedom from an oppressive society and a checkered past as well as the absence of God. Because the society excludes her, she considers the possibility that many of the traditions upheld by the Puritan culture are untrue and are not designed to bring her happiness.\n\nAs for Dimmesdale, the \"cheating minister\", his sin gives him \"sympathies so intimate with the sinful brotherhood of mankind, so that his chest vibrate[s] in unison with theirs.\" His eloquent and powerful sermons derive from this sense of empathy.<ref name=\"sparknotes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/scarlet/ |title=The Scarlet Letter |publisher=Sparknotes |date= |accessdate=2012-08-07}}</ref> The narrative of the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale is quite in keeping with the oldest and most fully authorized principles in [[Christian thought]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} His \"Fall\" is a descent from apparent grace to his own damnation; he appears to begin in purity but he ends in corruption. The subtlety is that the minister's belief is his own cheating, convincing himself at every stage of his spiritual [[pilgrimage]] that he is saved.<ref>Davidson, E.H. 1963. Dimmesdale's Fall. ''The New England Quarterly'' '''36''': 358\u2013370</ref>\n\nThe rose bush's beauty forms a striking contrast to all that surrounds it; as later the beautifully embroidered scarlet \"A\" will be held out in part as an invitation to find \"some sweet moral blossom\" in the ensuing, tragic tale and in part as an image that \"the deep heart of nature\" (perhaps God) may look more kindly on the errant Hester and her child than her Puritan neighbors do. Throughout the work, the nature images contrast with the stark darkness of the Puritans and their systems.<ref name=\"yahoo\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070308211539/http://education.yahoo.com/homework_help/cliffsnotes/the_scarlet_letter/ ''The Scarlet Letter'' by Nathaniel Hawthorne], CliffNotes from Yahoo! Education</ref>\n\nChillingworth's misshapen body reflects (or symbolizes) the anger in his soul, which builds as the novel progresses, similar to the way Dimmesdale's illness reveals his inner turmoil. The outward man reflects the condition of the heart; an observation thought inspired by the deterioration of [[Edgar Allan Poe]], whom Hawthorne \"much admired\".<ref name=\"yahoo\"/>\n\nAnother theme is the extreme legalism of the Puritans and how Hester chooses not to conform to their rules and beliefs. Hester was rejected by the villagers even though she spent her life doing what she could to help the sick and the poor. Because of the social [[shunning]], she spent her life mostly in solitude and would not go to church.\n\nAs a result, she retreats into her own mind and her own thinking. Her thoughts begin to stretch and go beyond what would be considered by the Puritans as safe. She still sees her sin, but begins to look on it differently than the villagers ever have. She begins to believe that a person's earthly sins do not necessarily condemn them. She even goes so far as to tell Dimmesdale that their sin has been paid for by their daily penance and that their sin will not keep them from getting to heaven, although the Puritans believed that such a sin surely condemns.{{dubious|date=December 2017}}{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nBut Hester had been alienated from the Puritan society, both in her physical life and spiritual life. When Dimmesdale dies, she knows she has to move on because she can no longer conform to the Puritans' strictness. Her thinking is free from puritan religious bounds and she has established her own different moral standards and beliefs.<ref name=\"sparknotes\"/>\n\n==Publication history==\n[[File:Hester Prynne.jpg|thumb|Hester Prynne at the [[stocks]], an engraved illustration from an 1878 edition]]\n\nIt was long thought that Hawthorne originally planned ''The Scarlet Letter'' to be a shorter [[Novella|novelette]], part of a collection named ''Old Time Legends'', and that his publisher, [[James Thomas Fields]], convinced him to expand the work to a full-length novel.<ref>Charvat, William.

He was a Puritan minister involved with the government of the colony, and also the [[Salem Witch Trials]].\n* Sir [[Thomas Overbury]] and Dr. Forman were the subjects of an adultery scandal in 1615 in England. Dr. Forman was charged with trying to poison his adulterous wife and her lover.

However, as time progresses, the meaning of the letter changed. It now represented, to some, able. It states \u201cThe letter was the symbol of her calling. Such helpfulness was found in her\u2014so much power to do, and power to sympathize\u2014that many people refused to interpret the scarlet A by its original signification. They said that it meant Able, so strong was Hester Prynne, with a woman's strength\u201d (129).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-scarlet-letter-nathaniel-hawthorne/1116620656?ean=9781593082079#/|title=The Scarlet Letter (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)|last=Noble|first=Barnes &|website=Barnes & Noble|language=en|access-date=2018-06-04}}</ref>\n* '''Meteor:''' The meteor shaped as an A serves as another symbol in the book. To Reverend Dimmesdale the meteor is a sign from God who is revealing his sin to everyone and causes him to be ridden with guilt. However, others perceived the letter to be a symbol for angel.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* '''Dimmesdale's name:''' Dimmesdale's name itself also holds symbolism. His name contains the root word \"dim\" which evokes the feeling of faint, weak, and gloom. This represents the constant state Dimmesdale finds himself in. His life has dimmed itself ever since his sin, causing his light of life to fade and dim.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* '''Pearl''': Pearl symbolizes the embodiment of her parent's sin and passion. She is a constant reminder of the sin from which her mother cannot escape. It is mentioned she \"was the scarlet letter in another form; the scarlet letter endowed in life\u201d (84).<ref name=\":0\" />\n* '''Rosebush:''' The rosebush is mentioned twice within the course of the story. At the beginning, it is first viewed as nature's way of offering beauty to those who leave and enter the prison as well as providing a glimmer of hope to those who inhabit it. The rosebush is perceived as a symbol of brightness in a story filled with human sorrow.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* '''The Scaffold''': The scaffold is mentioned three times throughout the novel. It can be viewed as separating the book into the beginning, middle, and end. It symbolizes shame, revelation of sin, and guilt for it is where Hester received her scarlet letter as punishment and where Dimmesdale experiences his revelation through the meteor.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Adaptations and influence==\n{{Main|The Scarlet Letter in popular culture}}\n''The Scarlet Letter'' has inspired numerous film, television, and stage adaptations, and plot elements have influenced several novels, musical works, and screen productions.\n\nIn March 2015, Manga Classics Inc. published a manga adaptation of ''The Scarlet Letter'', was adopted by Crystal S.
