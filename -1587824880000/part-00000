Please do not change \"are\" to \"is\". --> a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Blackpool]], Lancashire, in 1967. Initially playing [[blues rock]] and [[jazz fusion]], the band later developed their sound to incorporate elements of [[hard rock]] and [[folk music|folk]] to forge a [[progressive rock]] signature.<ref>{{cite web|last=Eder |first=Bruce |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/jethro-tull-p4610 |title=Jethro Tull |website=AllMusic |accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref> The band is led by vocalist/flautist/guitarist [[Ian Anderson]], and has featured a revolving door of lineups through the years including significant members such as guitarists [[Mick Abrahams]] and [[Martin Barre]], keyboardists [[John Evan]] and [[Dee Palmer]], drummers [[Clive Bunker]], [[Barriemore Barlow]], and [[Doane Perry]], and bassists [[Glenn Cornick]], [[Jeffrey Hammond]], [[John Glascock]], and [[Dave Pegg]].\n\nThe group first achieved commercial success in 1969, with the folk-tinged electric blues album ''[[Stand Up (Jethro Tull album)|Stand Up]]'', which reached No. 1 in the UK, and they toured regularly in the UK and the US. Their musical style shifted in the direction of progressive rock with the albums ''[[Aqualung (Jethro Tull album)|Aqualung]]'' (1971), ''[[Thick as a Brick]]'' (1972) and ''[[A Passion Play]]'' (1973), and shifted again to hard rock mixed with [[folk rock]] with ''[[Songs from the Wood]]'' (1977) and ''[[Heavy Horses]]'' (1978). After an excursion into [[electronic rock]] in the early-to-mid 1980s, the band won its sole [[Grammy Award]] with the 1987 album ''[[Crest of a Knave]]''.

The compilation ''[[50 for 50]]'' was released in 2018.\n\nThe reformed group\u2014now billed as \"Ian Anderson and the Jethro Tull band\"\u2014still performs live, and has announced tour dates into 2020.  The current band line-up includes musicians who have been members of Anderson's solo band since 2012.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n[[Ian Anderson]], [[Jeffrey Hammond]] and [[John Evan]] (originally Evans), who would become members of Jethro Tull, attended [[grammar school]] together in [[Blackpool]]. Anderson was born in [[Dunfermline]], [[Scotland]] and grew up in [[Edinburgh]] before moving to Blackpool in January 1960.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=4}} Evans had become a fan of [[the Beatles]] after seeing them play \"[[Love Me Do]]\" on [[Granada Television]]'s ''Scene at 6:30''. Though he was an accomplished pianist, he decided to take up the drums, as it was an instrument featured in the Beatles' line-up.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|pp=5\u20136}} Anderson had acquired a [[Classical guitar|Spanish guitar]] and taught himself how to play it, and the pair decided to form a band.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=7}} The pair recruited Hammond on bass, who brought along his collection of [[blues music|blues]] records to listen to.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=8}}\n\nThe group initially played as a three piece at local clubs and venues, before Evans became influenced by [[Georgie Fame]] and [[the Animals]] and switched to organ, recruiting drummer [[Barriemore Barlow|Barrie Barlow]]{{sfn|Rabey|2013|pp=14\u201315}} and guitarist Mike Stephens from local band the Atlantics.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=12}}{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=12}} By 1964 the band had recruited guitarist Chris Riley{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=12}} and developed into a six-piece [[blue-eyed soul]] band called the John Evan Band (later the John Evan Smash). Evans had shortened his surname to \"Evan\" at the insistence of Hammond, who thought it sounded better and more unusual. The group recruited Johnny Taylor as a booking agent and played gigs further afield around northwest England,{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=15}} playing a mixture of blues and [[Motown]] covers.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=14}} Hammond subsequently quit the band to go to [[art school]].{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=15}} He was briefly replaced by Derek Ward, then by [[Glenn Cornick]].{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=17}} Riley also quit and was replaced by Neil Smith.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=17}} The group recorded three songs at Regent Sound Studios in [[Denmark Street]], London in April 1967, and appeared at [[The Marquee]] club in June.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=27}}\n\nIn November 1967, the band moved to the London area, basing themselves in [[Luton]]. They signed a management deal with Terry Ellis and Chris Wright and replaced Smith with guitarist [[Mick Abrahams]],{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=19}} but quickly realised that supporting a 6-piece band was financially impractical, and the group split up. Anderson, Abrahams and Cornick decided to stay together, recruiting Abrahams' friend [[Clive Bunker]] on drums{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=18}} and becoming a [[British blues]] band.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=26}} Cornick recalled that although Evan left, the band said he was welcome to rejoin at a later date.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=27}} Anderson shared a ground-floor flat with Cornick in a large house at the top of Studley Road in Luton,<ref>[http://www.tullpress.com/zzjul76.htm Zigzag, July 1976]</ref> and worked as a cleaner for the Luton Ritz Cinema to pay the rent.<ref>[http://www.tullpress.com/bbc79a.htm BBC Radio interview, March 1979]</ref> According to Cornick, \"we were so poor that we would share one can of stew or soup between us each evening.\" <ref>[https://www.psychedelicbabymag.com/2011/12/glenn-cornick-interview-about-jethro.html Psychedelic Baby Magazine, 13 December 2011] Retrieved 22 September 2019</ref>\n\n===Early years (1967\u20131968)===\nAt first, the new band had trouble getting repeat bookings and they took to changing their name frequently to continue playing the London club circuit, names which included \"Navy Blue\", \"Ian Henderson's Bag o' Nails\", and \"Candy Coloured Rain\". Anderson recalled looking at a poster at a club and concluding that the band name he didn't recognise was his.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=22}} Band names were often supplied by their booking agents' staff, one of whom, a history enthusiast, eventually christened them \"Jethro Tull\" after [[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|the 18th-century agriculturist]]. The name stuck because they happened to be using it the first time a club manager liked their show enough to invite them to return.<ref name=\"billboard end\"/> They recorded a session with producer [[Derek Lawrence]], which resulted in the single \"Sunshine Day\". The B-side \"Aeroplane\" was an old John Evan Band track with the saxophones mixed out. It was released in February 1968 on [[MGM Records]], miscredited to \"Jethro Toe\".{{sfn|Rees|1998|pp=23\u201323}} Anderson has since questioned the misnomer as a way to avoid paying royalties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.austindaze.com/2006/08/29/jethro-tull-ian-anderson/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108173613/http://www.austindaze.com/2006/08/29/jethro-tull-ian-anderson/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 November 2011 |title=Jethro Tull (Ian Anderson) |publisher=Austin Daze |date=29 August 2006 |accessdate=11 November 2012 }}</ref> The more common version, with the name spelled correctly, is actually a [[counterfeit]] made in New York.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dag Sandbu |url=http://www.collecting-tull.com/Collectibles/7_JethroToe.htm |title=MGM Jethro Toe |publisher=Collecting-tull.com |accessdate=11 November 2012}}</ref> Anderson later met Hammond while in London and the two renewed their friendship, while Anderson moved into a [[bedsit]] in Chelsea with Evan.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=35}} Hammond became the subject of several songs, beginning with their next single, \"A Song for Jeffrey\".{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=36}}\n\nAnderson possessed a large [[overcoat]], his father having given it to him with the words \"You'd better take this. It's going to be a cold winter\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Ballad of Jethro Tull |date=2019 |publisher=Rocket 88 |location=London |isbn=9781910978429 |page=25}}</ref> This overcoat, and slightly later on the flute, became part of his early stage image. It was around this time that Anderson purchased a flute after becoming frustrated with his inability to play guitar as well as Abrahams, and because their managers thought he should remain a rhythm guitarist, with Abrahams becoming the front man.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=24}} \n\n<blockquote>I didn't want to be just another third-rate guitar player who sounded like a bunch of other third-rate guitar players. I wanted to do something that was a bit more idiosyncratic, hence the switch to another instrument. When Jethro Tull began, I think I'd been playing the flute for about two weeks. It was a quick learning curve&nbsp;... literally every night I walked onstage was a flute lesson.<ref name=\"Newsome\">Newsome, Jim. \"Living in the Present\". Interview with Ian Anderson, 23 April 2002. [http://www.jimnewsom.com/IanAndersonInterview.html jimnewsom.com]</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe group's first major break occurred at the [[National Jazz and Blues Festival]] at [[Sunbury-on-Thames]] in August 1968, where the band drew a rapturous reception and positive reviews in the music press. The band have since claimed that the success at Sunbury was a result of their persistent touring, which had generated a grassroots following who had all assembled at the festival and encouraged the rest of the audience. Cornick recalled, \"from that moment on, we were a big band\".{{sfn|Rees|1998|pp=24\u201325}}\n\nThe group recorded their first album, ''[[This Was]]'', between June and August 1968, and it was released in October, reaching number 10 in the charts.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|pp=41,42}} In addition to original material, the album included the traditional \"Cat's Squirrel\", which highlighted Abrahams' blues-rock style, while the [[Rahsaan Roland Kirk]]-penned jazz piece \"Serenade to a Cuckoo\" gave Anderson a showcase for his growing talents on the flute.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=42}} The overall sound of the group at this time was described in the ''[[Record Mirror]]'' by Anderson in 1968 as \"a sort of progressive blues with a bit of jazz\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tullpress.com/rm12oct68.htm |title=Record Mirror, 12 October, 1968 |access-date=11 February 2007 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61DN3yU3K?url=http://www.tullpress.com/rm12oct68.htm |archive-date=26 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the album's release, Abrahams left the band in December to form his own group, [[Blodwyn Pig]].{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=43}} There were a number of reasons given for his departure. Abrahams had heard that Ellis wanted Anderson to be the frontman and group leader, at his expense, and realised he was unlikely to have the majority share in songwriting.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=37}} Other reasons given were that Abrahams was a blues purist while Anderson wanted to branch out into other forms of music, and that Abrahams was unwilling to travel internationally or play more than three nights a week.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themarqueeclub.net/jethro-tull |title=Jethro Tull biography at themarquee.net |publisher=Themarqueeclub.net |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719175356/http://www.themarqueeclub.net/jethro-tull |archivedate=19 July 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.squirrelmusic.com/ |title=Mick's Bio at Mick Abrahams' official website |publisher=Squirrelmusic.com |date=}}</ref> Abrahams himself described his reasons more succinctly: \"I was fed up with all the nonsense, and I wanted to form a band like Blodwyn Pig.\"<ref>Rock Guitar Daily blog. [rockguitardaily.blogspot.com/mick-abrahams]</ref>\n\nThe group tried several replacements for Abrahams. The first was [[David O'List]], who had recently left [[the Nice]]. After a week's rehearsal, O'List didn't show up and lost contact with the group. The next choice was [[Mick Taylor]], who turned the group down because he felt his current gig with [[John Mayall's Bluesbreakers]] was a better deal.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=43}} Following this, the group put an advertisement in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' which was answered by [[Tony Iommi]]. After a few rehearsals, the group appeared in ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]'' on 11 December. The group performed \"A Song for Jeffrey\", but only Anderson's singing and flute were live; the rest was [[mime]]d. Iommi felt closer to his old band, 'Earth' (now known as Black Sabbath), so he returned to Birmingham to rejoin them. \n\nThe next choice was [[Martin Barre]], who had seen the band perform at Sunbury,{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=47}} and had been tried out at the same audition as Iommi. Barre arranged a second audition with Anderson, who showed him some new songs that were in a different style to the blues they had been recording. Anderson was impressed by Barre's technique, and offered him the job as the new guitarist.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=44}} Barre played his first gig with Jethro Tull on 30 December 1968 at the Winter Gardens, Penzance.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=30}}\n\n===''Stand Up'' through ''Aqualung'' (1969\u20131971)===\nAfter Barre joined, the group did a few shows supporting [[Jimi Hendrix]] in Scandinavia,{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=49}} then set out on an extensive tour of the US, supporting [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Vanilla Fudge]].{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=31}} Having attracted a substantial live following, Ellis and Wright asked Anderson, who had become the dominant songwriter, to write a hit single. The result was \"[[Living in the Past (song)|Living in the Past]]\", which reached No. 3 in May on the UK singles chart and No. 11 in the US,{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=31}} and resulted in an appearance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. Although other so-called \"serious\" groups actively resisted issuing stand-alone singles at the time, Jethro Tull felt a hit single was a positive move for the group, if not their priority.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=32}}\n\n[[File:Jethro-Tull-9-73(2).jpg|thumb|140px|[[John Evan]], an old schoolfriend and bandmate, joined the band in April 1970, after several invitations to do so]]\nThe next album was ''[[Stand Up (Jethro Tull album)|Stand Up]]'', recorded during April\u2013May and August 1969.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=52}} It was released in September, and quickly reached No. 1 in the UK charts, the only album by the group to do so. Anderson had now established himself as the group's leader and songwriter, and wrote all of the material, aside from his jazzy rearrangement of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach]]'s \"[[Bourr\u00e9e in E minor]] BWV 996 (fifth movement)\".{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=32}} The album cover unfolded to a photo insert of the band attached to the covers like a [[pop-up book]].\n\nImmediately after releasing ''Stand Up'', the group set off on their first headlining tour in the US, including an appearance at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]].{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=33}} Barre recalled, \"It was really the turning point for Jethro Tull\u2014for everything that we were to become and everything we were to inspire in others.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tullpress.com/gwjun99.htm |title=Guitar World, June, 1999 |access-date=17 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311053104/http://www.tullpress.com/gwjun99.htm |archive-date=11 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The band was invited to play in the [[Woodstock 1969|Woodstock Festival]], but Anderson declined, being afraid that the band would be permanently typecast as [[hippie]]s, able to play only one musical style.<ref>[http://www.tullpress.com/craug01.htm Classic Rock, August, 2001]</ref>\n\nOn 29 January 1970 the band appeared on BBC's ''Top of the Pops'' again, performing \"Witch's Promise\".<ref>{{cite web|author=TV.com |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/top-of-the-pops-uk/29th-january-1970-943665/ |title=Top of the Pops (UK)&nbsp;\u2013 Season 7, Episode 5: 29th January 1970 |publisher=TV.com |date= |accessdate=30 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{youtube|-0GAuexrVzo|Jethro Tull&nbsp;\u2013 The Witches Promise}}</ref> Evan rejoined the band in early 1970. He had stayed in London since the John Evan Band broke up, living with Anderson, and began studying music at the [[University of London]]. The pair did not see much of each other because of Jethro Tull's increasing workload, and Evan was reluctant to rejoin because of his studies, which gave him access to a free studio.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=65}} He played as a [[session musician]] on the next album, ''[[Benefit (album)|Benefit]]'' (1970), following which Anderson said they needed somebody to play the keyboard parts on tour. His tutor eventually persuaded him that it was a good idea, and Evan formally joined.{{sfn|Rees|1998|pp=36,37}} The album reached No. 4 in the UK and No. 11 in the US,{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=186}} and allowed the group to sell out 20,000-seat arenas, establishing themselves as a premier live act.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/jethro-tull/biography |title=Jethro Tull Biography |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=28 June 2013}}</ref> In August, the band played to one of their largest audiences at the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1970|1970 Isle of Wight festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/nothing-is-easy-live-at-the-isle-of-wight-1970-dvd-mw0001016771|title=Nothing Is Easy : Live at the Isle of Wight 1970|first=Bruce|last=Eder|website=AllMusic|accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Isle of Wight appearance was followed by another US tour, following which Cornick left the band.

The album was split into two sides, subtitled 'Aqualung' and 'My God', and featured Anderson's opinions about organised religion.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=76}} Recording the album was problematic because of technical issues in the studio and Hammond's rusty musical skills. On \"Locomotive Breath\", Anderson recorded the backing track on his own, singing along to a [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]] accompaniment, which the rest of the band recorded on top of later.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=77}} Despite Anderson's concerns that it may have been \"too radical\" compared with the band's previous albums, ''Aqualung'' was the first Jethro Tull album to reach the top ten in the US, peaking at No. 7.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=186}} It sold over one million copies, earning it a [[Music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in July 1971.{{sfn|Murrells|1978|p=295}}\n\n===Progressive rock (1972\u20131976)===\nBecause of the heavy touring schedule and his wish to spend more time with his family, drummer Bunker quit the group after the ''Aqualung'' album in May 1971,{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=80}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jethrotull.com/the-attic/past-band-members-and-guests/clive-bunker/ |title=Clive Bunker&nbsp;\u2013 The Official Jethro Tull Website |publisher=J-tull.com |date=12 December 1946 |accessdate=6 July 2011}}</ref> and was replaced by [[Barriemore Barlow|Barrie Barlow]], whom Anderson rechristened \"Barriemore\".

On a \"banter\" track that accompanies the 2005 ''Aqualung Live'' album recorded for [[XM Satellite Radio]], Anderson insisted, \"I always said at the time, this is not a concept album. It's an album of varied songs...in which three or four are kind of the keynote pieces for the album, but it doesn't make it a concept album.\"\n\nIn response to the many critics who called ''Aqualung'' a concept album, Anderson decided to \"come up with something that really is the mother of all concept albums\".{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=48}} He had become influenced by [[Monty Python]]'s humour, and wrote a suite that combined complex musical ideas with a sense of humour to make fun of the band, its audience and its critics.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|pp=84,85}} The album, released in 1972, became ''[[Thick as a Brick]]'', which was co-credited to a fictional schoolboy, [[Gerald Bostock]].{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=48}} It consisted of a single track running over 43 minutes, split over two sides, which was uncommon for rock albums.{{sfn|Smith|1997|p=113}} Although the finished album was a continuous piece of music, it was written and recorded in stages, with the whole band helping with the arrangements.{{sfn|Nollen|2002|p=83}} ''Thick as a Brick'' was the first Tull album to reach number one on the (US) Billboard Pop Albums chart{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=82}} with the following year's ''[[A Passion Play]]'' being the only other to do so.<ref>{{AllMusic |class=album|id=r10373|tab=charts-awards|label=Billboard chart info ''A Passion Play''|accessdate=16 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jethro-Tull-cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Ian Anderson and Martin Barre of Jethro Tull in Chicago, 1973]]\n\n1972 also saw the release of ''[[Living in the Past (album)|Living in the Past]]'', a double-[[compilation album|album compilation]] of remixed singles, [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]s and outtakes (including the entirety of the ''Life Is a Long Song'' EP, which closes the album),{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=87}} with the third side recorded live in 1970 at New York's [[Carnegie Hall]] concert on 4 November 1970.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=67}} The album was successful, as it allowed new fans to catch up with early singles, particularly in the US where they had not been popular on initial release.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=87}} ''[[New Musical Express]]'' called Jethro Tull one of \"Britain's most important and successful 2nd generation progressive bands\".<ref>[http://www.tullpress.com/nme1jul72.htm NME, 1 July, 1972]</ref>\n\nIn 1973, while in [[tax exile]], the band attempted to produce a double album at France's [[Ch\u00e2teau d'H\u00e9rouville]] studios, something [[the Rolling Stones]] and [[Elton John]] among others were doing at the time, but supposedly they were unhappy with the quality of the recording studio and abandoned the effort, subsequently mocking the studio as the \"Chateau d'Isaster\". They returned to England, and Anderson did some rewriting before Jethro Tull quickly recorded and released ''[[A Passion Play]]'' (1973), another single-track concept album, with allegorical lyrics focusing on the afterlife. Like ''Thick as a Brick'', ''A Passion Play'' contained instrumentation rather uncommon in rock music. The album also featured an eccentric interlude, \"The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles\", which was co-written (along with Anderson and Evan) and narrated by bassist Hammond.  ''A Passion Play'' sold well but received generally poor reviews, including a particularly damning review of its live performance by Chris Welch of ''[[Melody Maker]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tullpress.com/mm30jun73.htm |title=Melody Maker, 30 June, 1973 |access-date=19 June 2006 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61DN4r5MA?url=http://www.tullpress.com/mm30jun73.htm |archive-date=26 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nEven as the band's popularity with critics began to wane around this time, their popularity with the public remained strong, as evidenced by high sales of their follow-up album, 1974's ''[[War Child (album)|War Child]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=16870 |title=\"Bungle in the Jungle by Jethro Tull\" at |publisher=Songfacts.com |date=}}</ref> Originally intended to be a companion piece for a film, it reached number two on the US [[Billboard charts]] and received some critical acclaim, and produced the radio mainstays \"[[Bungle in the Jungle]]\" (#12 on the US singles chart) and \"[[Skating Away on the Thin Ice of the New Day]]\". It also included a short [[Acoustic music|acoustic song]], \"Only Solitaire\", widely thought to be aimed at ''L.A. Times'' rock music critic [[Robert Hilburn]], who had written a harsh review of the ''A Passion Play'' concerts at the [[Santa Monica Civic Auditorium]]. However, Anderson said the song was written before Hilburn's review and was aimed at music critics in general. The ''War Child'' tour also featured a female [[string quartet]] playing along with the group on the new material.\n\nIn 1975, the band released ''[[Minstrel in the Gallery]]'', an album which resembled ''Aqualung'' (1971) in that it contrasted softer, acoustic-guitar-based pieces with lengthier, more bombastic works headlined by Barre's electric guitar. Written and recorded during Anderson's divorce from his first wife [[Jennie Franks]], the album is characterised by a markedly more introspective tone than their previous album, and critics gave it mixed reviews.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} By this point Jethro Tull had been awarded six [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] gold records for sales of ''Stand Up'' (1969), ''Aqualung'' (1971), ''Thick as a Brick'' (1972), ''Living in the Past'' (1972), ''A Passion Play'' (1973), and ''Minstrel in the Gallery'' (1975).{{sfn|Murrells|1978|p=295}} For the 1975 tour, [[Dee Palmer|David Palmer]], who had long been the band's orchestra arranger, officially joined the band's stage show on keyboards and synthesisers. In February 1975 Jethro Tull sold out five nights at the 20,000-seat [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|Los Angeles Forum]], prompting ''Melody Maker'' to run the headline \"Jethro&nbsp;\u2013 Now The World's Biggest Band?\"<ref name=\"jethrotull.com\">{{cite web|url=http://jethrotull.com/minstrel-in-the-gallery/ |title=Minstrel in the Gallery |publisher=Jethro Tull |date=5 September 1975}}</ref> After the tour, bassist Hammond quit the band to pursue painting. [[John Glascock]], who earlier was playing with [[flamenco]]-rock band [[Carmen (rock band)|Carmen]], a support band on the previous Jethro Tull tour, became the band's new bassist.\n\n1976's ''[[Too Old to Rock 'n' Roll: Too Young to Die!]]'' was another concept album, this time about the life of an ageing rocker. Glascock made his first appearance on this album, contributing harmony and second vocals in addition to the bass lines. Palmer continued to arrange, and he recorded as a guest on two songs. For the 1976 tour, Jethro Tull became one of the first bands to use giant projection screens for the larger stadium shows.<ref name=\"jethrotull.com\"/> Although ''Too Old...'' did not sell as well as the other 1970s albums, the 1976 compilation ''[[M.U. - The Best of Jethro Tull]]'', achieved Platinum Album in US and Gold record in UK. A television special was recorded showing the development of the album's concept in a live show with the band (fully dressed in the most rock-hard-tongue-in-cheek outfits), but the programme was never officially released.\n\n===Folk rock (1977\u20131979)===\n[[File:Jethro Tull 5.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Ian Anderson]] playing with Jethro Tull, [[Hammersmith Odeon]], March 1978]]\nIn the late 1970s, Jethro Tull released a trio of [[folk rock]] albums, ''[[Songs from the Wood]]'' (1977), ''[[Heavy Horses]]'' (1978), and ''[[Stormwatch (album)|Stormwatch]]'' (1979). ''Songs from the Wood'' (1977) was the first Tull album to receive generally positive reviews since the release of ''Living in the Past'' (1972).\n\nThe band had long ties to folk rockers [[Steeleye Span]] (Tull were the backing band on Steeleye Span front woman [[Maddy Prior]]'s 1978 solo album ''[[Woman in the Wings]]'' as a way of repaying her for contributing vocals on the ''Too Old to Rock 'n' Roll: Too Young to Die!'' album) and with [[Fairport Convention]] (Fairport members [[Dave Pegg]], [[Martin Allcock]], [[Dave Mattacks]] and Ric Sanders have all played with Tull at one point or another, as well as folk drummer [[Gerry Conway (musician)|Gerry Conway]] who became a Fairport member after playing with Tull). Although not formally considered a part of the folk rock movement (which had actually begun nearly a decade earlier with the advent of [[Fairport Convention]]), there was clearly an exchange of musical ideas among Tull and the folk rockers.<ref name=\"ArtistWiki\" /> By this time, Anderson had moved to a farm in the countryside, and his new bucolic lifestyle was clearly reflected in his songwriting, as in the title track of ''[[Heavy Horses]]'' (1978), a paean to [[Draft horse|draught horses]].\n\nThe band continued to tour, and released a live double album in 1978, titled ''[[Bursting Out]]'', which was recorded during the European leg of the ''Heavy Horses'' tour. During the US leg of this tour, John Glascock suffered health problems and was replaced by Anderson's friend and former [[Stealers Wheel]] bassist, [[Tony Williams (English musician)|Tony Williams]].\n\nTheir third folk influenced album, ''[[Stormwatch (album)|Stormwatch]]'', was released in 1979.  During the making of the album, Glascock suffered major health issues related to open heart surgery from the previous year, so Anderson played bass on much of the album.  After the release of ''Stormwatch'', due to Glascock's continued health issues, Fairport Convention bassist [[Dave Pegg]] was hired for the ensuing tour, during which Glascock died from heart complications at his home in England.<ref>\"A Tull Tale: Groovemaker in Jon Noyce\". Jansson, M. Bass Player \"11\". pp. 40, 42, 44</ref>\n\n===The \"Big Split\" and electronic rock (1980\u20131984)===\n[[File:19821016-44A-IanAndersonWithBeast.jpg|thumb|Ian Anderson ''Broadsword and the Beast'' concert, Dallas, Texas, 1982.]]\nFollowing the end of the ''Stormwatch'' tour in early 1980, Jethro Tull would undergo its largest line-up shuffle to date, resulting in Barlow, Evan and Palmer all leaving the band.  Different stories have been given over the years for the various reasons behind the band's restructuring, including that Barlow was depressed and withdrawn after Glascock's death and that Evan and Palmer found their futures in the band to be murky with Anderson's announcement that he wanted to work on a solo album. \nIn the 2008 Classic Artists documentary ''Jethro Tull: Their Fully Authorised Story'', Barlow claimed that he left the band on a mutual agreement with Anderson while Evan and Palmer both recalled being dismissed by a letter in the mail, with no prior contact.<ref>{{cite AV media| people = Al-Issawi, Omar (Director)| title = Jethro Tull: Their Fully Authorised Story | medium = DVD| publisher = Classic Artists| location = United Kingdom| date = 2008 }}</ref> \nFollowing their termination from Jethro Tull, Evan and Palmer briefly collaborated in a classical-based pop/rock band called Tallis.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://prod.whinc.net/tullrevision/musicians/pastmembers/johnevan.html| title=Past Members-John Evan| work=prod.whinc.net| accessdate=23 May 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523230652/http://prod.whinc.net/tullrevision/musicians/pastmembers/johnevan.html| archive-date=23 May 2014| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref> Jethro Tull was left with Anderson (the only original member), Martin Barre and Dave Pegg.\n\nTull's first album of the 1980s was intended to be Ian Anderson's first solo album. Anderson retained Barre on electric guitar and Pegg on bass, while adding [[Mark Craney]] on drums, and special guest keyboardist/violinist [[Eddie Jobson]] (ex\u2013[[Roxy Music]], [[Frank Zappa]], [[Curved Air]] and [[U.K. (band)|U.K.]], the last of which had opened for several shows on Tull's ''Stormwatch'' tour). Highlighted by the prominent use of synthesisers, it contrasted sharply with the established \"Tull sound\".  After pressure from [[Chrysalis Records]], Anderson agreed to release it as a Jethro Tull album. Entitled ''[[A (Jethro Tull album)|A]]'' (taken from the labels on the master tapes for his scrapped solo album, marked simply \"A\" for \"Anderson\"), it was released in mid-1980.\n\nIn keeping with the mood of innovation surrounding the album, Jethro Tull developed a music video titled ''[[Slipstream (video)|Slipstream]]''.<ref>[http://www.allmovie.com/movie/v26124 ''Slipstream'' at allmovie.com] Retrieved 3 September 2014.</ref> Four staged and separately filmed music videos are mixed with concert footage from the ''A'' tour. London's [[HMV Hammersmith Apollo|Hammersmith Odeon]] was used for exterior scenes, but the main concert footage was actually from an American performance in Los Angeles, at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena|Los Angeles Sports Arena]] (as heard on the Magic Piper ROIO), filmed in November 1980. The video, released in 1981, was directed by [[David Mallet (director)|David Mallet]], who has directed numerous music videos, including the pioneering \"[[Ashes to Ashes (David Bowie song)|Ashes to Ashes]]\" video for [[David Bowie]].\n\nJobson and Craney returned to their own work following the ''A'' tour and Jethro Tull entered a period of revolving drummers: [[Gerry Conway (musician)|Gerry Conway]], who left after deciding he couldn't be the one to replace Barlow {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}, [[Phil Collins]] (as a fill-in for the recently departed Gerry Conway, played with the band at the first [[The Prince's Trust|Prince's Trust]] concert in 1982), [[Paul Burgess (musician)|Paul Burgess]] (for the US leg of the Broadsword and the Beast tour, and who left to settle down with his family) and permanent drummer [[Doane Perry]].\n\n1981 was the first year in their career that the band did not release an album; however, some recording sessions took place (Anderson, Barre, Pegg, and Conway, with Anderson playing the keyboards). Some of these tracks were released on the ''[[Nightcap (album)|Nightcap]]'' compilation in 1993.\n\nIn 1982, [[Peter-John Vettese]] joined on keyboards, and the band returned to a somewhat folkier sound\u2014albeit with synthesisers\u2014for 1982's ''[[The Broadsword and the Beast]]''. The ensuing concert tour for the album was well attended and the shows featured what was to be one of the group's last indulgences in full-dress theatricality. The stage was built to resemble a [[Longship|Viking longship]] and the band performed in faux-medieval regalia.\n\nAn Anderson solo album, which was in fact a collaborative Anderson-Vettese effort, appeared in 1983, in the form of the heavily electronic ''[[Walk into Light]]''.  As with later solo efforts by Anderson and Barre, some of the ''Walk into Light'' songs\u2014such as \"Fly by Night\", \"Made in England\" and \"Different Germany\"\u2014later made their way into Jethro Tull live sets.\n\nIn 1984, Jethro Tull released ''[[Under Wraps (Jethro Tull album)|Under Wraps]]'', a heavily electronic album with no \"live\" drummer and instead, as on ''Walk into Light'', a drum-machine was used. Although the band were reportedly proud of the sound, the album was not well received.  However, the video for \"Lap of Luxury\" did manage to earn moderate rotation on the newly influential [[MTV]] music video channel.  As a result of the throat problems Anderson developed singing the demanding ''Under Wraps'' material on tour, Jethro Tull took a three-year break. Vettese quit the band after the tour, angry at critics for the bad reviews of ''The Broadsword and the Beast'' (1982), ''Walk into Light'' (1983), and ''Under Wraps'' (1984).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.isbuc.co.uk/People/IanAnd.htm| title=Ian Anderson| author=Isle of Skye Business Community| accessdate=22 April 2007}}</ref> During this hiatus, Anderson continued to oversee the salmon farm he had founded in 1978, although the single \"Coronach\" was released in the UK in 1986 after it was used as the theme tune for a Channel 4 television program called \"Blood of the British\".\n\n===Anderson, Barre, Pegg and Perry: the \"hard rock\" Tull (1987\u20131994)===\nJethro Tull returned in 1987 with ''[[Crest of a Knave]]''. With Vettese absent (Anderson contributed the synth programming) and the band relying more heavily on Barre's electric guitar than they had since the early 1970s, the album was a critical and commercial success. Shades of their earlier electronic excursions were still present, however, as three of the album's songs again used a drum machine, with Doane Perry and Gerry Conway sharing drum duties on the other tracks. Prior to the ''Crest of a Knave'' tour, keyboardist [[Don Airey]] (ex-[[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Michael Schenker Group]]) joined the band.\n\nThe band won the 1988 [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrumental]], beating the favorite [[Metallica]] and their ''[[...And Justice for All (album)|...And Justice for All]]'' album. The award was particularly controversial as many did not consider Jethro Tull hard rock, much less heavy metal. On the advice of their manager, who told them they had no chance of winning, no one from the band attended the award ceremony.<ref name=\"ArtistWiki\">{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Jethro+Tull/+wiki |title=Artist Wiki: Jethro Tull |publisher=Last.fm |date=26 November 2013}}</ref> In response to the criticism they received over the award, their label, Chrysalis, took out an advertisement in a British music periodical with a picture of a flute lying amid a pile of iron re-bar and the line, \"the flute is a heavy metal instrument.\" In response to an interview question about the controversy, Ian Anderson quipped, \"Well, we do sometimes play our mandolins very loudly.\" In 2007, the win was named one of the ten biggest upsets in Grammy history by [[Entertainment Weekly]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Grammy's 10 Biggest Upsets| work=Entertainment Weekly| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,1567466_20010834_20010795_0,00.html| accessdate=13 February 2007}}</ref> In 1992, when Metallica finally won the Grammy in the category, Metallica drummer [[Lars Ulrich]] joked, \"First thing we're going to do is thank Jethro Tull for not putting out an album this year\", a play on a Grammy comment by [[Paul Simon]] some years before thanking [[Stevie Wonder]] for the same thing.\n\nThe style of ''[[Crest of a Knave]]'' (1987) has been compared to that of [[Dire Straits]], in part because Anderson no longer seemed to have the vocal range he once possessed and preferred to use the lower registers, while Martin Barre's guitar sound apparently drifted towards [[Mark Knopfler]]'s style. Two songs in particular\u2014\"Farm on the Freeway\" and \"Steel Monkey\"\u2014got heavy radio airplay. The album also contained the popular live song \"Budapest\", which depicts a backstage scene with a shy local female stagehand. Although \"Budapest\" was the longest song on that album (at just over ten minutes), \"Mountain Men\" became more famous in Europe, depicting a scene from World War II in Africa. Ian Anderson referred to the battles of [[Second Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]] and the [[Falkland Islands]], drawing historical parallels of the angst that women left behind by their warrior husbands might have felt: {{quote|died in the trenches at El Alamein,<br />died in the Falklands on TV}}\n\nThey toured this album with \"The Not Quite the World, More the Here and There Tour\". It was also the first time in the band's history that it had two electric guitar players on stage, when Anderson, albeit rarely, played rhythm guitar.\n\n1988 was notable for the release of ''[[20 Years of Jethro Tull]]'', a five-LP themed set (also released as a three-CD set, and as a truncated single CD version on ''20 Years of Jethro Tull: Highlights'') consisting largely of rarities and outtakes from throughout the band's history, as well as a variety of live and remastered tracks. It also included a booklet outlining the band's history in detail. Now out of print, it has become a collector's item, although many (but not all) of the outtakes have been included as bonus tracks on remastered releases of the band's studio albums.\n\nIn 1989, the band released ''[[Rock Island (Jethro Tull album)|Rock Island]]'', which met with less commercial and critical success than ''Crest of a Knave'' (1987). The lead-off track, \"Kissing Willie\", featured bawdy double-entendre lyrics and over-the-top heavy metal riffing that seemed to take a satiric view of the group's recent Grammy award win. The song's accompanying video found difficulty in receiving airplay because of its sexual imagery.  Although ''Rock Island'' was something of a miss for the group, a couple of fan favourites did emerge from the album. \"Big Riff and Mando\" reflects life on the road for the relentlessly touring musicians, giving a wry account of the theft of Barre's prized mandolin by a starstruck fan. \"Another Christmas Song\", an upbeat number celebrating the humanitarian spirit of the holiday season, stood out against the brooding and sombre mood of many of the songs on the album and was well received at concerts. It was re-recorded for the 2003 ''[[The Jethro Tull Christmas Album]]'' release.\n\n1991's ''[[Catfish Rising]]'' was a more solid album than ''Rock Island'' (1989). Despite being labelled as a \"return to playing the blues\", the album actually is marked by the generous use of mandolin and acoustic guitar and much less use of keyboards than any Tull album of the Eighties. Notable tracks included \"Rocks on the Road\", which highlighted gritty acoustic guitar work and hard-bitten lyrics about urban life and \"Still Loving You Tonight\", a bluesy, low-key ballad.\n\n===''Roots to Branches'' and ''J-Tull.com'': the world music influences (1995\u20132000)===\n[[File:Jethro tull - Jerusalem 2007.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jethro Tull performing in [[Jerusalem]], 2007]]\n\nFollowing a further, semi-acoustic 1992 tour (which included [[Dave Mattacks]] but not [[Andrew Giddings|Andy Giddings]], and which was documented with ''[[A Little Light Music]]'', the band's second official live album), Anderson relearned how to play the flute (after his daughter, who took up flute classes at school, discovered that her father often used the wrong fingering)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jethro-tull.com/musicians/iananderson/equipment.html |title=Ian Anderson's Equipment&nbsp;\u2013 The Official Jethro Tull Website |publisher=Jethro-tull.com |accessdate=6 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713103527/http://jethro-tull.com/musicians/iananderson/equipment.html |archive-date=13 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and began writing songs that heavily featured world music influences. However, the first Tull releases containing the \"relearned\" flute were the 1993 ''[[25th Anniversary Box Set]]'' which, as well as the remixes of classic songs and unreleased live material, included a whole CD of old songs from the band's entire career recorded by the current line-up, and the 1993 ''[[Nightcap (album)|Nightcap]]'' compilation album containing unreleased studio material (mainly from the scrapped pre-''A Passion Play'' album), with multiple flute parts re-recorded.\n\nPrior to the recording of 1995's ''[[Roots to Branches]]'' album, longstanding bass player Dave Pegg left the band, wishing to concentrate on Fairport Convention and not being keen on the world-music direction the band chose. Doane Perry (returning as the band's full-time drummer) recruited his friend and widely respected session bass player [[Steve Bailey]] to fill the gap: Ian Anderson, in turn, relinquished control of the rhythm section arrangements on that record, leaving them completely to Bailey and Perry. Despite his studio contributions, however, Bailey did not join the band, and Pegg's formal replacement as Jethro Tull bassist was [[Jonathan Noyce]].\n\n''Roots to Branches'' (1995) and 1999's ''[[J-Tull Dot Com]]'' were less rock-based than ''Crest of a Knave'' (1987) or ''Catfish Rising'' (1991). Songs on these albums reflect the musical influences of decades of performing all around the globe. In songs such as \"Out of the Noise\" and \"Hot Mango Flush\", Anderson paints vivid pictures of third-world street scenes. These albums reflected Anderson's coming to grips with being an old rocker, with songs such as the pensive \"Another Harry's Bar\", \"Wicked Windows\" (a meditation on reading glasses), and the gruff \"Wounded, Old and Treacherous\".\n\n===Live albums, world tours and ''The Jethro Tull Christmas Album'' (2001\u20132010)===\nIn January 2002, the original lineup of the band (including Anderson, Abrahams, Cornick and Bunker) reunited for a one-off pub performance in England that was filmed for inclusion in the ''Living with the Past'' DVD.  It was the first and only time the original four members had played together since 1968, as well as the only time a former Tull lineup has ever reunited.\n\n2003 saw the release of ''[[The Jethro Tull Christmas Album]]'', a collection of traditional Christmas songs together with old and new Christmas songs written by Jethro Tull. It is the last studio album of this band. It became the band's biggest commercial success since the 1987 ''Crest of a Knave''. An Ian Anderson live double album and DVD was released in 2005 called ''[[Ian Anderson Plays the Orchestral Jethro Tull]]''. In addition, a DVD entitled ''[[Nothing Is Easy: Live at the Isle of Wight 1970]]'' and a live album ''[[Aqualung Live]]'' (recorded in 2004) were released in 2005.\n\n2006 saw the release of a dual boxed set DVD ''Collector's Edition'', containing two DVDs\u2014''[[Nothing Is Easy: Live at the Isle of Wight 1970]]'' and ''[[Living with the Past]]''. Bassist Jon Noyce left the band in March 2006. Keyboardist [[Andrew Giddings]] quit the band in July 2006, citing constant touring allowing not enough time for family. They were replaced by [[David Goodier]] and [[John O'Hara (musician)|John O'Hara]] respectively. In the following year ''[[The Best of Acoustic Jethro Tull]]'', a 24-song set of Tull's and Ian Anderson's acoustic performances taken from various albums, was released. Included are a new live acoustic version of \"One Brown Mouse\" and a live performance of the traditional song (attributed to [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]), \"[[Pastime with Good Company]]\".\n\nIn September 2007, Jethro Tull released CD/DVD ''[[Live at Montreux 2003 (Jethro Tull album)|Live at Montreux 2003]]''. The concert was recorded on 4 July 2003 and featured, among others, \"Fat Man\", \"With You There to Help Me\" and \"Hunting Girl\", with the longest unchanged line-up: Anderson, Barre, Perry, Noyce and Giddings.\n\nIn February 2010, the band were commemorated with a [[Heritage Award]] by [[PRS for Music]]. A plaque was erected on a Catholic church in [[Blackpool]], where the band performed their first ever gig.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/lancashire/8536951.stm |work=BBC News | title=Jethro Tull's church gig honoured | date=25 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Anderson and Barre go solo and the end of Jethro Tull (2011\u20132012)===\n2011 marked the 40th Anniversary of ''[[Aqualung (Jethro Tull album)|Aqualung]]'' (1971). A new re-issue was released with new remix of the album (by [[Porcupine Tree]]'s [[Steven Wilson]]), and included a DVD and unreleased songs.\n\nDuring interviews in November 2011, Martin Barre stated that there were no current plans for future Jethro Tull work.

Though he was an accomplished pianist, he decided to take up the drums, as it was an instrument featured in the Beatles' line-up.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|pp=5\u20136}} Anderson had acquired a [[Classical guitar|Spanish guitar]] and taught himself how to play it, and the pair decided to form a band.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=7}} The pair recruited Hammond on bass, who brought along his collection of [[blues music|blues]] records to listen to.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=8}}\n\nThe group initially played as a three piece at local clubs and venues, before Evans became influenced by [[Georgie Fame]] and [[the Animals]] and switched to organ, recruiting drummer [[Barriemore Barlow|Barrie Barlow]]{{sfn|Rabey|2013|pp=14\u201315}} and guitarist Mike Stephens from local band the Atlantics.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=12}}{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=12}} By 1964 the band had recruited guitarist Chris Riley{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=12}} and developed into a six-piece [[blue-eyed soul]] band called the John Evan Band (later the John Evan Smash). Evans had shortened his surname to \"Evan\" at the insistence of Hammond, who thought it sounded better and more unusual. The group recruited Johnny Taylor as a booking agent and played gigs further afield around northwest England,{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=15}} playing a mixture of blues and [[Motown]] covers.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=14}} Hammond subsequently quit the band to go to [[art school]].{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=15}} He was briefly replaced by Derek Ward, then by [[Glenn Cornick]].{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=17}} Riley also quit and was replaced by Neil Smith.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=17}} The group recorded three songs at Regent Sound Studios in [[Denmark Street]], London in April 1967, and appeared at [[The Marquee]] club in June.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=27}}\n\nIn November 1967, the band moved to the London area, basing themselves in [[Luton]]. They signed a management deal with Terry Ellis and Chris Wright and replaced Smith with guitarist [[Mick Abrahams]],{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=19}} but quickly realised that supporting a 6-piece band was financially impractical, and the group split up. Anderson, Abrahams and Cornick decided to stay together, recruiting Abrahams' friend [[Clive Bunker]] on drums{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=18}} and becoming a [[British blues]] band.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=26}} Cornick recalled that although Evan left, the band said he was welcome to rejoin at a later date.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=27}} Anderson shared a ground-floor flat with Cornick in a large house at the top of Studley Road in Luton,<ref>[http://www.tullpress.com/zzjul76.htm Zigzag, July 1976]</ref> and worked as a cleaner for the Luton Ritz Cinema to pay the rent.<ref>[http://www.tullpress.com/bbc79a.htm BBC Radio interview, March 1979]</ref> According to Cornick, \"we were so poor that we would share one can of stew or soup between us each evening.\" <ref>[https://www.psychedelicbabymag.com/2011/12/glenn-cornick-interview-about-jethro.html Psychedelic Baby Magazine, 13 December 2011] Retrieved 22 September 2019</ref>\n\n===Early years (1967\u20131968)===\nAt first, the new band had trouble getting repeat bookings and they took to changing their name frequently to continue playing the London club circuit, names which included \"Navy Blue\", \"Ian Henderson's Bag o' Nails\", and \"Candy Coloured Rain\". Anderson recalled looking at a poster at a club and concluding that the band name he didn't recognise was his.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=22}} Band names were often supplied by their booking agents' staff, one of whom, a history enthusiast, eventually christened them \"Jethro Tull\" after [[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|the 18th-century agriculturist]]. The name stuck because they happened to be using it the first time a club manager liked their show enough to invite them to return.<ref name=\"billboard end\"/> They recorded a session with producer [[Derek Lawrence]], which resulted in the single \"Sunshine Day\". The B-side \"Aeroplane\" was an old John Evan Band track with the saxophones mixed out. It was released in February 1968 on [[MGM Records]], miscredited to \"Jethro Toe\".{{sfn|Rees|1998|pp=23\u201323}} Anderson has since questioned the misnomer as a way to avoid paying royalties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.austindaze.com/2006/08/29/jethro-tull-ian-anderson/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108173613/http://www.austindaze.com/2006/08/29/jethro-tull-ian-anderson/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 November 2011 |title=Jethro Tull (Ian Anderson) |publisher=Austin Daze |date=29 August 2006 |accessdate=11 November 2012 }}</ref> The more common version, with the name spelled correctly, is actually a [[counterfeit]] made in New York.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dag Sandbu |url=http://www.collecting-tull.com/Collectibles/7_JethroToe.htm |title=MGM Jethro Toe |publisher=Collecting-tull.com |accessdate=11 November 2012}}</ref> Anderson later met Hammond while in London and the two renewed their friendship, while Anderson moved into a [[bedsit]] in Chelsea with Evan.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=35}} Hammond became the subject of several songs, beginning with their next single, \"A Song for Jeffrey\".{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=36}}\n\nAnderson possessed a large [[overcoat]], his father having given it to him with the words \"You'd better take this. It's going to be a cold winter\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Ballad of Jethro Tull |date=2019 |publisher=Rocket 88 |location=London |isbn=9781910978429 |page=25}}</ref> This overcoat, and slightly later on the flute, became part of his early stage image. It was around this time that Anderson purchased a flute after becoming frustrated with his inability to play guitar as well as Abrahams, and because their managers thought he should remain a rhythm guitarist, with Abrahams becoming the front man.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=24}} \n\n<blockquote>I didn't want to be just another third-rate guitar player who sounded like a bunch of other third-rate guitar players. I wanted to do something that was a bit more idiosyncratic, hence the switch to another instrument. When Jethro Tull began, I think I'd been playing the flute for about two weeks. It was a quick learning curve&nbsp;... literally every night I walked onstage was a flute lesson.<ref name=\"Newsome\">Newsome, Jim. \"Living in the Present\". Interview with Ian Anderson, 23 April 2002. [http://www.jimnewsom.com/IanAndersonInterview.html jimnewsom.com]</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe group's first major break occurred at the [[National Jazz and Blues Festival]] at [[Sunbury-on-Thames]] in August 1968, where the band drew a rapturous reception and positive reviews in the music press. The band have since claimed that the success at Sunbury was a result of their persistent touring, which had generated a grassroots following who had all assembled at the festival and encouraged the rest of the audience. Cornick recalled, \"from that moment on, we were a big band\".{{sfn|Rees|1998|pp=24\u201325}}\n\nThe group recorded their first album, ''[[This Was]]'', between June and August 1968, and it was released in October, reaching number 10 in the charts.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|pp=41,42}} In addition to original material, the album included the traditional \"Cat's Squirrel\", which highlighted Abrahams' blues-rock style, while the [[Rahsaan Roland Kirk]]-penned jazz piece \"Serenade to a Cuckoo\" gave Anderson a showcase for his growing talents on the flute.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=42}} The overall sound of the group at this time was described in the ''[[Record Mirror]]'' by Anderson in 1968 as \"a sort of progressive blues with a bit of jazz\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tullpress.com/rm12oct68.htm |title=Record Mirror, 12 October, 1968 |access-date=11 February 2007 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61DN3yU3K?url=http://www.tullpress.com/rm12oct68.htm |archive-date=26 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the album's release, Abrahams left the band in December to form his own group, [[Blodwyn Pig]].{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=43}} There were a number of reasons given for his departure. Abrahams had heard that Ellis wanted Anderson to be the frontman and group leader, at his expense, and realised he was unlikely to have the majority share in songwriting.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=37}} Other reasons given were that Abrahams was a blues purist while Anderson wanted to branch out into other forms of music, and that Abrahams was unwilling to travel internationally or play more than three nights a week.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themarqueeclub.net/jethro-tull |title=Jethro Tull biography at themarquee.net |publisher=Themarqueeclub.net |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719175356/http://www.themarqueeclub.net/jethro-tull |archivedate=19 July 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.squirrelmusic.com/ |title=Mick's Bio at Mick Abrahams' official website |publisher=Squirrelmusic.com |date=}}</ref> Abrahams himself described his reasons more succinctly: \"I was fed up with all the nonsense, and I wanted to form a band like Blodwyn Pig.\"<ref>Rock Guitar Daily blog. [rockguitardaily.blogspot.com/mick-abrahams]</ref>\n\nThe group tried several replacements for Abrahams. The first was [[David O'List]], who had recently left [[the Nice]]. After a week's rehearsal, O'List didn't show up and lost contact with the group. The next choice was [[Mick Taylor]], who turned the group down because he felt his current gig with [[John Mayall's Bluesbreakers]] was a better deal.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=43}} Following this, the group put an advertisement in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' which was answered by [[Tony Iommi]]. After a few rehearsals, the group appeared in ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]'' on 11 December. The group performed \"A Song for Jeffrey\", but only Anderson's singing and flute were live; the rest was [[mime]]d. Iommi felt closer to his old band, 'Earth' (now known as Black Sabbath), so he returned to Birmingham to rejoin them. \n\nThe next choice was [[Martin Barre]], who had seen the band perform at Sunbury,{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=47}} and had been tried out at the same audition as Iommi. Barre arranged a second audition with Anderson, who showed him some new songs that were in a different style to the blues they had been recording. Anderson was impressed by Barre's technique, and offered him the job as the new guitarist.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=44}} Barre played his first gig with Jethro Tull on 30 December 1968 at the Winter Gardens, Penzance.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=30}}\n\n===''Stand Up'' through ''Aqualung'' (1969\u20131971)===\nAfter Barre joined, the group did a few shows supporting [[Jimi Hendrix]] in Scandinavia,{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=49}} then set out on an extensive tour of the US, supporting [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Vanilla Fudge]].{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=31}} Having attracted a substantial live following, Ellis and Wright asked Anderson, who had become the dominant songwriter, to write a hit single. The result was \"[[Living in the Past (song)|Living in the Past]]\", which reached No. 3 in May on the UK singles chart and No. 11 in the US,{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=31}} and resulted in an appearance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. Although other so-called \"serious\" groups actively resisted issuing stand-alone singles at the time, Jethro Tull felt a hit single was a positive move for the group, if not their priority.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=32}}\n\n[[File:Jethro-Tull-9-73(2).jpg|thumb|140px|[[John Evan]], an old schoolfriend and bandmate, joined the band in April 1970, after several invitations to do so]]\nThe next album was ''[[Stand Up (Jethro Tull album)|Stand Up]]'', recorded during April\u2013May and August 1969.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=52}} It was released in September, and quickly reached No. 1 in the UK charts, the only album by the group to do so. Anderson had now established himself as the group's leader and songwriter, and wrote all of the material, aside from his jazzy rearrangement of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S.

The album was split into two sides, subtitled 'Aqualung' and 'My God', and featured Anderson's opinions about organised religion.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=76}} Recording the album was problematic because of technical issues in the studio and Hammond's rusty musical skills. On \"Locomotive Breath\", Anderson recorded the backing track on his own, singing along to a [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]] accompaniment, which the rest of the band recorded on top of later.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=77}} Despite Anderson's concerns that it may have been \"too radical\" compared with the band's previous albums, ''Aqualung'' was the first Jethro Tull album to reach the top ten in the US, peaking at No. 7.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=186}} It sold over one million copies, earning it a [[Music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in July 1971.{{sfn|Murrells|1978|p=295}}\n\n===Progressive rock (1972\u20131976)===\nBecause of the heavy touring schedule and his wish to spend more time with his family, drummer Bunker quit the group after the ''Aqualung'' album in May 1971,{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=80}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jethrotull.com/the-attic/past-band-members-and-guests/clive-bunker/ |title=Clive Bunker&nbsp;\u2013 The Official Jethro Tull Website |publisher=J-tull.com |date=12 December 1946 |accessdate=6 July 2011}}</ref> and was replaced by [[Barriemore Barlow|Barrie Barlow]], whom Anderson rechristened \"Barriemore\".

On a \"banter\" track that accompanies the 2005 ''Aqualung Live'' album recorded for [[XM Satellite Radio]], Anderson insisted, \"I always said at the time, this is not a concept album. It's an album of varied songs...in which three or four are kind of the keynote pieces for the album, but it doesn't make it a concept album.\"\n\nIn response to the many critics who called ''Aqualung'' a concept album, Anderson decided to \"come up with something that really is the mother of all concept albums\".{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=48}} He had become influenced by [[Monty Python]]'s humour, and wrote a suite that combined complex musical ideas with a sense of humour to make fun of the band, its audience and its critics.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|pp=84,85}} The album, released in 1972, became ''[[Thick as a Brick]]'', which was co-credited to a fictional schoolboy, [[Gerald Bostock]].{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=48}} It consisted of a single track running over 43 minutes, split over two sides, which was uncommon for rock albums.{{sfn|Smith|1997|p=113}} Although the finished album was a continuous piece of music, it was written and recorded in stages, with the whole band helping with the arrangements.{{sfn|Nollen|2002|p=83}} ''Thick as a Brick'' was the first Tull album to reach number one on the (US) Billboard Pop Albums chart{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=82}} with the following year's ''[[A Passion Play]]'' being the only other to do so.<ref>{{AllMusic |class=album|id=r10373|tab=charts-awards|label=Billboard chart info ''A Passion Play''|accessdate=16 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jethro-Tull-cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Ian Anderson and Martin Barre of Jethro Tull in Chicago, 1973]]\n\n1972 also saw the release of ''[[Living in the Past (album)|Living in the Past]]'', a double-[[compilation album|album compilation]] of remixed singles, [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]s and outtakes (including the entirety of the ''Life Is a Long Song'' EP, which closes the album),{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=87}} with the third side recorded live in 1970 at New York's [[Carnegie Hall]] concert on 4 November 1970.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=67}} The album was successful, as it allowed new fans to catch up with early singles, particularly in the US where they had not been popular on initial release.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=87}} ''[[New Musical Express]]'' called Jethro Tull one of \"Britain's most important and successful 2nd generation progressive bands\".<ref>[http://www.tullpress.com/nme1jul72.htm NME, 1 July, 1972]</ref>\n\nIn 1973, while in [[tax exile]], the band attempted to produce a double album at France's [[Ch\u00e2teau d'H\u00e9rouville]] studios, something [[the Rolling Stones]] and [[Elton John]] among others were doing at the time, but supposedly they were unhappy with the quality of the recording studio and abandoned the effort, subsequently mocking the studio as the \"Chateau d'Isaster\". They returned to England, and Anderson did some rewriting before Jethro Tull quickly recorded and released ''[[A Passion Play]]'' (1973), another single-track concept album, with allegorical lyrics focusing on the afterlife. Like ''Thick as a Brick'', ''A Passion Play'' contained instrumentation rather uncommon in rock music. The album also featured an eccentric interlude, \"The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles\", which was co-written (along with Anderson and Evan) and narrated by bassist Hammond.  ''A Passion Play'' sold well but received generally poor reviews, including a particularly damning review of its live performance by Chris Welch of ''[[Melody Maker]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tullpress.com/mm30jun73.htm |title=Melody Maker, 30 June, 1973 |access-date=19 June 2006 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61DN4r5MA?url=http://www.tullpress.com/mm30jun73.htm |archive-date=26 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nEven as the band's popularity with critics began to wane around this time, their popularity with the public remained strong, as evidenced by high sales of their follow-up album, 1974's ''[[War Child (album)|War Child]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=16870 |title=\"Bungle in the Jungle by Jethro Tull\" at |publisher=Songfacts.com |date=}}</ref> Originally intended to be a companion piece for a film, it reached number two on the US [[Billboard charts]] and received some critical acclaim, and produced the radio mainstays \"[[Bungle in the Jungle]]\" (#12 on the US singles chart) and \"[[Skating Away on the Thin Ice of the New Day]]\". It also included a short [[Acoustic music|acoustic song]], \"Only Solitaire\", widely thought to be aimed at ''L.A. Times'' rock music critic [[Robert Hilburn]], who had written a harsh review of the ''A Passion Play'' concerts at the [[Santa Monica Civic Auditorium]]. However, Anderson said the song was written before Hilburn's review and was aimed at music critics in general. The ''War Child'' tour also featured a female [[string quartet]] playing along with the group on the new material.\n\nIn 1975, the band released ''[[Minstrel in the Gallery]]'', an album which resembled ''Aqualung'' (1971) in that it contrasted softer, acoustic-guitar-based pieces with lengthier, more bombastic works headlined by Barre's electric guitar. Written and recorded during Anderson's divorce from his first wife [[Jennie Franks]], the album is characterised by a markedly more introspective tone than their previous album, and critics gave it mixed reviews.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} By this point Jethro Tull had been awarded six [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] gold records for sales of ''Stand Up'' (1969), ''Aqualung'' (1971), ''Thick as a Brick'' (1972), ''Living in the Past'' (1972), ''A Passion Play'' (1973), and ''Minstrel in the Gallery'' (1975).{{sfn|Murrells|1978|p=295}} For the 1975 tour, [[Dee Palmer|David Palmer]], who had long been the band's orchestra arranger, officially joined the band's stage show on keyboards and synthesisers. In February 1975 Jethro Tull sold out five nights at the 20,000-seat [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|Los Angeles Forum]], prompting ''Melody Maker'' to run the headline \"Jethro&nbsp;\u2013 Now The World's Biggest Band?\"<ref name=\"jethrotull.com\">{{cite web|url=http://jethrotull.com/minstrel-in-the-gallery/ |title=Minstrel in the Gallery |publisher=Jethro Tull |date=5 September 1975}}</ref> After the tour, bassist Hammond quit the band to pursue painting. [[John Glascock]], who earlier was playing with [[flamenco]]-rock band [[Carmen (rock band)|Carmen]], a support band on the previous Jethro Tull tour, became the band's new bassist.\n\n1976's ''[[Too Old to Rock 'n' Roll: Too Young to Die!]]'' was another concept album, this time about the life of an ageing rocker. Glascock made his first appearance on this album, contributing harmony and second vocals in addition to the bass lines. Palmer continued to arrange, and he recorded as a guest on two songs. For the 1976 tour, Jethro Tull became one of the first bands to use giant projection screens for the larger stadium shows.<ref name=\"jethrotull.com\"/> Although ''Too Old...'' did not sell as well as the other 1970s albums, the 1976 compilation ''[[M.U. - The Best of Jethro Tull]]'', achieved Platinum Album in US and Gold record in UK. A television special was recorded showing the development of the album's concept in a live show with the band (fully dressed in the most rock-hard-tongue-in-cheek outfits), but the programme was never officially released.\n\n===Folk rock (1977\u20131979)===\n[[File:Jethro Tull 5.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Ian Anderson]] playing with Jethro Tull, [[Hammersmith Odeon]], March 1978]]\nIn the late 1970s, Jethro Tull released a trio of [[folk rock]] albums, ''[[Songs from the Wood]]'' (1977), ''[[Heavy Horses]]'' (1978), and ''[[Stormwatch (album)|Stormwatch]]'' (1979). ''Songs from the Wood'' (1977) was the first Tull album to receive generally positive reviews since the release of ''Living in the Past'' (1972).\n\nThe band had long ties to folk rockers [[Steeleye Span]] (Tull were the backing band on Steeleye Span front woman [[Maddy Prior]]'s 1978 solo album ''[[Woman in the Wings]]'' as a way of repaying her for contributing vocals on the ''Too Old to Rock 'n' Roll: Too Young to Die!'' album) and with [[Fairport Convention]] (Fairport members [[Dave Pegg]], [[Martin Allcock]], [[Dave Mattacks]] and Ric Sanders have all played with Tull at one point or another, as well as folk drummer [[Gerry Conway (musician)|Gerry Conway]] who became a Fairport member after playing with Tull). Although not formally considered a part of the folk rock movement (which had actually begun nearly a decade earlier with the advent of [[Fairport Convention]]), there was clearly an exchange of musical ideas among Tull and the folk rockers.<ref name=\"ArtistWiki\" /> By this time, Anderson had moved to a farm in the countryside, and his new bucolic lifestyle was clearly reflected in his songwriting, as in the title track of ''[[Heavy Horses]]'' (1978), a paean to [[Draft horse|draught horses]].\n\nThe band continued to tour, and released a live double album in 1978, titled ''[[Bursting Out]]'', which was recorded during the European leg of the ''Heavy Horses'' tour. During the US leg of this tour, John Glascock suffered health problems and was replaced by Anderson's friend and former [[Stealers Wheel]] bassist, [[Tony Williams (English musician)|Tony Williams]].\n\nTheir third folk influenced album, ''[[Stormwatch (album)|Stormwatch]]'', was released in 1979.  During the making of the album, Glascock suffered major health issues related to open heart surgery from the previous year, so Anderson played bass on much of the album.  After the release of ''Stormwatch'', due to Glascock's continued health issues, Fairport Convention bassist [[Dave Pegg]] was hired for the ensuing tour, during which Glascock died from heart complications at his home in England.<ref>\"A Tull Tale: Groovemaker in Jon Noyce\".

Bass Player \"11\". pp. 40, 42, 44</ref>\n\n===The \"Big Split\" and electronic rock (1980\u20131984)===\n[[File:19821016-44A-IanAndersonWithBeast.jpg|thumb|Ian Anderson ''Broadsword and the Beast'' concert, Dallas, Texas, 1982.]]\nFollowing the end of the ''Stormwatch'' tour in early 1980, Jethro Tull would undergo its largest line-up shuffle to date, resulting in Barlow, Evan and Palmer all leaving the band.  Different stories have been given over the years for the various reasons behind the band's restructuring, including that Barlow was depressed and withdrawn after Glascock's death and that Evan and Palmer found their futures in the band to be murky with Anderson's announcement that he wanted to work on a solo album. \nIn the 2008 Classic Artists documentary ''Jethro Tull: Their Fully Authorised Story'', Barlow claimed that he left the band on a mutual agreement with Anderson while Evan and Palmer both recalled being dismissed by a letter in the mail, with no prior contact.<ref>{{cite AV media| people = Al-Issawi, Omar (Director)| title = Jethro Tull: Their Fully Authorised Story | medium = DVD| publisher = Classic Artists| location = United Kingdom| date = 2008 }}</ref> \nFollowing their termination from Jethro Tull, Evan and Palmer briefly collaborated in a classical-based pop/rock band called Tallis.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://prod.whinc.net/tullrevision/musicians/pastmembers/johnevan.html| title=Past Members-John Evan| work=prod.whinc.net| accessdate=23 May 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523230652/http://prod.whinc.net/tullrevision/musicians/pastmembers/johnevan.html| archive-date=23 May 2014| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref> Jethro Tull was left with Anderson (the only original member), Martin Barre and Dave Pegg.\n\nTull's first album of the 1980s was intended to be Ian Anderson's first solo album. Anderson retained Barre on electric guitar and Pegg on bass, while adding [[Mark Craney]] on drums, and special guest keyboardist/violinist [[Eddie Jobson]] (ex\u2013[[Roxy Music]], [[Frank Zappa]], [[Curved Air]] and [[U.K. (band)|U.K.]], the last of which had opened for several shows on Tull's ''Stormwatch'' tour). Highlighted by the prominent use of synthesisers, it contrasted sharply with the established \"Tull sound\".  After pressure from [[Chrysalis Records]], Anderson agreed to release it as a Jethro Tull album. Entitled ''[[A (Jethro Tull album)|A]]'' (taken from the labels on the master tapes for his scrapped solo album, marked simply \"A\" for \"Anderson\"), it was released in mid-1980.\n\nIn keeping with the mood of innovation surrounding the album, Jethro Tull developed a music video titled ''[[Slipstream (video)|Slipstream]]''.<ref>[http://www.allmovie.com/movie/v26124 ''Slipstream'' at allmovie.com] Retrieved 3 September 2014.</ref> Four staged and separately filmed music videos are mixed with concert footage from the ''A'' tour. London's [[HMV Hammersmith Apollo|Hammersmith Odeon]] was used for exterior scenes, but the main concert footage was actually from an American performance in Los Angeles, at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena|Los Angeles Sports Arena]] (as heard on the Magic Piper ROIO), filmed in November 1980. The video, released in 1981, was directed by [[David Mallet (director)|David Mallet]], who has directed numerous music videos, including the pioneering \"[[Ashes to Ashes (David Bowie song)|Ashes to Ashes]]\" video for [[David Bowie]].\n\nJobson and Craney returned to their own work following the ''A'' tour and Jethro Tull entered a period of revolving drummers: [[Gerry Conway (musician)|Gerry Conway]], who left after deciding he couldn't be the one to replace Barlow {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}, [[Phil Collins]] (as a fill-in for the recently departed Gerry Conway, played with the band at the first [[The Prince's Trust|Prince's Trust]] concert in 1982), [[Paul Burgess (musician)|Paul Burgess]] (for the US leg of the Broadsword and the Beast tour, and who left to settle down with his family) and permanent drummer [[Doane Perry]].\n\n1981 was the first year in their career that the band did not release an album; however, some recording sessions took place (Anderson, Barre, Pegg, and Conway, with Anderson playing the keyboards). Some of these tracks were released on the ''[[Nightcap (album)|Nightcap]]'' compilation in 1993.\n\nIn 1982, [[Peter-John Vettese]] joined on keyboards, and the band returned to a somewhat folkier sound\u2014albeit with synthesisers\u2014for 1982's ''[[The Broadsword and the Beast]]''. The ensuing concert tour for the album was well attended and the shows featured what was to be one of the group's last indulgences in full-dress theatricality. The stage was built to resemble a [[Longship|Viking longship]] and the band performed in faux-medieval regalia.\n\nAn Anderson solo album, which was in fact a collaborative Anderson-Vettese effort, appeared in 1983, in the form of the heavily electronic ''[[Walk into Light]]''.  As with later solo efforts by Anderson and Barre, some of the ''Walk into Light'' songs\u2014such as \"Fly by Night\", \"Made in England\" and \"Different Germany\"\u2014later made their way into Jethro Tull live sets.\n\nIn 1984, Jethro Tull released ''[[Under Wraps (Jethro Tull album)|Under Wraps]]'', a heavily electronic album with no \"live\" drummer and instead, as on ''Walk into Light'', a drum-machine was used. Although the band were reportedly proud of the sound, the album was not well received.  However, the video for \"Lap of Luxury\" did manage to earn moderate rotation on the newly influential [[MTV]] music video channel.  As a result of the throat problems Anderson developed singing the demanding ''Under Wraps'' material on tour, Jethro Tull took a three-year break. Vettese quit the band after the tour, angry at critics for the bad reviews of ''The Broadsword and the Beast'' (1982), ''Walk into Light'' (1983), and ''Under Wraps'' (1984).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.isbuc.co.uk/People/IanAnd.htm| title=Ian Anderson| author=Isle of Skye Business Community| accessdate=22 April 2007}}</ref> During this hiatus, Anderson continued to oversee the salmon farm he had founded in 1978, although the single \"Coronach\" was released in the UK in 1986 after it was used as the theme tune for a Channel 4 television program called \"Blood of the British\".\n\n===Anderson, Barre, Pegg and Perry: the \"hard rock\" Tull (1987\u20131994)===\nJethro Tull returned in 1987 with ''[[Crest of a Knave]]''. With Vettese absent (Anderson contributed the synth programming) and the band relying more heavily on Barre's electric guitar than they had since the early 1970s, the album was a critical and commercial success. Shades of their earlier electronic excursions were still present, however, as three of the album's songs again used a drum machine, with Doane Perry and Gerry Conway sharing drum duties on the other tracks. Prior to the ''Crest of a Knave'' tour, keyboardist [[Don Airey]] (ex-[[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Michael Schenker Group]]) joined the band.\n\nThe band won the 1988 [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrumental]], beating the favorite [[Metallica]] and their ''[[...And Justice for All (album)|...And Justice for All]]'' album. The award was particularly controversial as many did not consider Jethro Tull hard rock, much less heavy metal. On the advice of their manager, who told them they had no chance of winning, no one from the band attended the award ceremony.<ref name=\"ArtistWiki\">{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Jethro+Tull/+wiki |title=Artist Wiki: Jethro Tull |publisher=Last.fm |date=26 November 2013}}</ref> In response to the criticism they received over the award, their label, Chrysalis, took out an advertisement in a British music periodical with a picture of a flute lying amid a pile of iron re-bar and the line, \"the flute is a heavy metal instrument.\" In response to an interview question about the controversy, Ian Anderson quipped, \"Well, we do sometimes play our mandolins very loudly.\" In 2007, the win was named one of the ten biggest upsets in Grammy history by [[Entertainment Weekly]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Grammy's 10 Biggest Upsets| work=Entertainment Weekly| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,1567466_20010834_20010795_0,00.html| accessdate=13 February 2007}}</ref> In 1992, when Metallica finally won the Grammy in the category, Metallica drummer [[Lars Ulrich]] joked, \"First thing we're going to do is thank Jethro Tull for not putting out an album this year\", a play on a Grammy comment by [[Paul Simon]] some years before thanking [[Stevie Wonder]] for the same thing.\n\nThe style of ''[[Crest of a Knave]]'' (1987) has been compared to that of [[Dire Straits]], in part because Anderson no longer seemed to have the vocal range he once possessed and preferred to use the lower registers, while Martin Barre's guitar sound apparently drifted towards [[Mark Knopfler]]'s style. Two songs in particular\u2014\"Farm on the Freeway\" and \"Steel Monkey\"\u2014got heavy radio airplay. The album also contained the popular live song \"Budapest\", which depicts a backstage scene with a shy local female stagehand. Although \"Budapest\" was the longest song on that album (at just over ten minutes), \"Mountain Men\" became more famous in Europe, depicting a scene from World War II in Africa. Ian Anderson referred to the battles of [[Second Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]] and the [[Falkland Islands]], drawing historical parallels of the angst that women left behind by their warrior husbands might have felt: {{quote|died in the trenches at El Alamein,<br />died in the Falklands on TV}}\n\nThey toured this album with \"The Not Quite the World, More the Here and There Tour\". It was also the first time in the band's history that it had two electric guitar players on stage, when Anderson, albeit rarely, played rhythm guitar.\n\n1988 was notable for the release of ''[[20 Years of Jethro Tull]]'', a five-LP themed set (also released as a three-CD set, and as a truncated single CD version on ''20 Years of Jethro Tull: Highlights'') consisting largely of rarities and outtakes from throughout the band's history, as well as a variety of live and remastered tracks. It also included a booklet outlining the band's history in detail. Now out of print, it has become a collector's item, although many (but not all) of the outtakes have been included as bonus tracks on remastered releases of the band's studio albums.\n\nIn 1989, the band released ''[[Rock Island (Jethro Tull album)|Rock Island]]'', which met with less commercial and critical success than ''Crest of a Knave'' (1987). The lead-off track, \"Kissing Willie\", featured bawdy double-entendre lyrics and over-the-top heavy metal riffing that seemed to take a satiric view of the group's recent Grammy award win. The song's accompanying video found difficulty in receiving airplay because of its sexual imagery.  Although ''Rock Island'' was something of a miss for the group, a couple of fan favourites did emerge from the album. \"Big Riff and Mando\" reflects life on the road for the relentlessly touring musicians, giving a wry account of the theft of Barre's prized mandolin by a starstruck fan. \"Another Christmas Song\", an upbeat number celebrating the humanitarian spirit of the holiday season, stood out against the brooding and sombre mood of many of the songs on the album and was well received at concerts. It was re-recorded for the 2003 ''[[The Jethro Tull Christmas Album]]'' release.\n\n1991's ''[[Catfish Rising]]'' was a more solid album than ''Rock Island'' (1989). Despite being labelled as a \"return to playing the blues\", the album actually is marked by the generous use of mandolin and acoustic guitar and much less use of keyboards than any Tull album of the Eighties. Notable tracks included \"Rocks on the Road\", which highlighted gritty acoustic guitar work and hard-bitten lyrics about urban life and \"Still Loving You Tonight\", a bluesy, low-key ballad.\n\n===''Roots to Branches'' and ''J-Tull.com'': the world music influences (1995\u20132000)===\n[[File:Jethro tull - Jerusalem 2007.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jethro Tull performing in [[Jerusalem]], 2007]]\n\nFollowing a further, semi-acoustic 1992 tour (which included [[Dave Mattacks]] but not [[Andrew Giddings|Andy Giddings]], and which was documented with ''[[A Little Light Music]]'', the band's second official live album), Anderson relearned how to play the flute (after his daughter, who took up flute classes at school, discovered that her father often used the wrong fingering)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jethro-tull.com/musicians/iananderson/equipment.html |title=Ian Anderson's Equipment&nbsp;\u2013 The Official Jethro Tull Website |publisher=Jethro-tull.com |accessdate=6 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713103527/http://jethro-tull.com/musicians/iananderson/equipment.html |archive-date=13 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and began writing songs that heavily featured world music influences. However, the first Tull releases containing the \"relearned\" flute were the 1993 ''[[25th Anniversary Box Set]]'' which, as well as the remixes of classic songs and unreleased live material, included a whole CD of old songs from the band's entire career recorded by the current line-up, and the 1993 ''[[Nightcap (album)|Nightcap]]'' compilation album containing unreleased studio material (mainly from the scrapped pre-''A Passion Play'' album), with multiple flute parts re-recorded.\n\nPrior to the recording of 1995's ''[[Roots to Branches]]'' album, longstanding bass player Dave Pegg left the band, wishing to concentrate on Fairport Convention and not being keen on the world-music direction the band chose. Doane Perry (returning as the band's full-time drummer) recruited his friend and widely respected session bass player [[Steve Bailey]] to fill the gap: Ian Anderson, in turn, relinquished control of the rhythm section arrangements on that record, leaving them completely to Bailey and Perry. Despite his studio contributions, however, Bailey did not join the band, and Pegg's formal replacement as Jethro Tull bassist was [[Jonathan Noyce]].\n\n''Roots to Branches'' (1995) and 1999's ''[[J-Tull Dot Com]]'' were less rock-based than ''Crest of a Knave'' (1987) or ''Catfish Rising'' (1991). Songs on these albums reflect the musical influences of decades of performing all around the globe. In songs such as \"Out of the Noise\" and \"Hot Mango Flush\", Anderson paints vivid pictures of third-world street scenes. These albums reflected Anderson's coming to grips with being an old rocker, with songs such as the pensive \"Another Harry's Bar\", \"Wicked Windows\" (a meditation on reading glasses), and the gruff \"Wounded, Old and Treacherous\".\n\n===Live albums, world tours and ''The Jethro Tull Christmas Album'' (2001\u20132010)===\nIn January 2002, the original lineup of the band (including Anderson, Abrahams, Cornick and Bunker) reunited for a one-off pub performance in England that was filmed for inclusion in the ''Living with the Past'' DVD.  It was the first and only time the original four members had played together since 1968, as well as the only time a former Tull lineup has ever reunited.\n\n2003 saw the release of ''[[The Jethro Tull Christmas Album]]'', a collection of traditional Christmas songs together with old and new Christmas songs written by Jethro Tull. It is the last studio album of this band. It became the band's biggest commercial success since the 1987 ''Crest of a Knave''. An Ian Anderson live double album and DVD was released in 2005 called ''[[Ian Anderson Plays the Orchestral Jethro Tull]]''. In addition, a DVD entitled ''[[Nothing Is Easy: Live at the Isle of Wight 1970]]'' and a live album ''[[Aqualung Live]]'' (recorded in 2004) were released in 2005.\n\n2006 saw the release of a dual boxed set DVD ''Collector's Edition'', containing two DVDs\u2014''[[Nothing Is Easy: Live at the Isle of Wight 1970]]'' and ''[[Living with the Past]]''. Bassist Jon Noyce left the band in March 2006. Keyboardist [[Andrew Giddings]] quit the band in July 2006, citing constant touring allowing not enough time for family. They were replaced by [[David Goodier]] and [[John O'Hara (musician)|John O'Hara]] respectively. In the following year ''[[The Best of Acoustic Jethro Tull]]'', a 24-song set of Tull's and Ian Anderson's acoustic performances taken from various albums, was released. Included are a new live acoustic version of \"One Brown Mouse\" and a live performance of the traditional song (attributed to [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]), \"[[Pastime with Good Company]]\".\n\nIn September 2007, Jethro Tull released CD/DVD ''[[Live at Montreux 2003 (Jethro Tull album)|Live at Montreux 2003]]''. The concert was recorded on 4 July 2003 and featured, among others, \"Fat Man\", \"With You There to Help Me\" and \"Hunting Girl\", with the longest unchanged line-up: Anderson, Barre, Perry, Noyce and Giddings.\n\nIn February 2010, the band were commemorated with a [[Heritage Award]] by [[PRS for Music]]. A plaque was erected on a Catholic church in [[Blackpool]], where the band performed their first ever gig.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/lancashire/8536951.stm |work=BBC News | title=Jethro Tull's church gig honoured | date=25 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Anderson and Barre go solo and the end of Jethro Tull (2011\u20132012)===\n2011 marked the 40th Anniversary of ''[[Aqualung (Jethro Tull album)|Aqualung]]'' (1971). A new re-issue was released with new remix of the album (by [[Porcupine Tree]]'s [[Steven Wilson]]) and include a DVD and unreleased songs.\n\nDuring interviews in November 2011, Martin Barre stated that there were no current plans for future Jethro Tull work. In 2012, Barre assembled and toured with a group, billed as Martin Barre's New Day, which included Jonathan Noyce that played mostly Tull material.<ref name=\"crr\">{{cite web | url=http://www.classicrockrevisited.com/interviewmartinbarre2011.htm | title=Forty years of Aqualung: An interview with Jethro Tull's Martin Barre | accessdate=25 November 2011 | author=Wright, Jeb | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123173724/http://www.classicrockrevisited.com/interviewmartinbarre2011.htm | archive-date=23 November 2011 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|date=22 November 2011|work=Classic Rock Revisited|title=Interview with Martin Barre}}</ref> In 2015, Barre stated \"It's important that people realize there will never be a Jethro Tull again.

This will be followed by tours in the UK and US, during which the album will be played in its entirety. ''Homo Erraticus'' will be a prog-rock concept album which, according to Anderson, \"chronicles the weird imaginings of one Ernest T. Parritt, as recaptured by the now middle-aged Gerald Bostock after a trip to Mathew Bunter's Old Library Bookshop in Linwell village. Bostock and Bunter came across this dusty, unpublished manuscript, written by local amateur historian Ernest T.

[[Purandar Singha]] was allowed to rule as king of Upper Assam in 1833, but after that brief period Assam was annexed to Bengal by the British. In 1873 British political control was imposed on western [[Naga people|Naga communities]]. On 6 February 1874 Assam, including [[Sylhet]], was severed from Bengal to form the Assam Chief-Commissionership, also known as the 'North-East Frontier'. Shillong was chosen as the capital of the Non-Regulation Province of Assam in September 1874. The [[Lushai Hills]] were transferred to Assam in 1897.\nThe new Commissionership included the five districts of Assam proper ([[Undivided Kamrup district|Kamrup]], [[Nagaon]], [[Darrang]], [[Sibsagar]] and [[Lakhimpur district|Lakhimpur]]), [[Khasi-Jaintia Hills]], [[Garo Hills]], [[Naga Hills District, British India|Naga Hills]], [[Goalpara]] and [[Sylhet district|Sylhet]]-[[Cachar]] comprising about 54,100 sq miles.

Saadulla's government resigned in September 1938, after the Congress changed its decision, and the Governor, Sir Robert Neil Reid, then invited [[Gopinath Bordoloi]]. Bordoloi's cabinet included the future [[President of India]] [[Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed]]. In 1939, all of the Congress ministries in British Indian provinces resigned, and [[Muhammed Saadulah|Sir Syed Muhammad Saadulla]] was again invited to form a ministry.\n\nSaadulla remained the Premier (Chief Minister) of Assam up to 1946, bar a period of Governor's Rule from 24 December 1941 to 24 August 1942.

It was incorporated into the new province of Eastern Bengal and Assam in 1905 and re-established as a province in 1912.\n\n==History==\n{{main|Colonial Assam}}\nIn 1824 Assam was occupied by British forces following the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]] and on 24 February 1826 it was ceded to Britain by Burma under [[Treaty of Yandabo|Yandaboo Treaty of 1826]].<ref>{{Citation\n |first=C.

[[Purandar Singha]] was allowed to rule as king of Upper Assam in 1833, but after that brief period Assam was annexed to Bengal by the British. In 1873 British political control was imposed on western [[Naga people|Naga communities]]. On 6 February 1874 Assam, including [[Sylhet]], was severed from Bengal to form the Assam Chief-Commissionership, also known as the 'North-East Frontier'. Shillong was chosen as the capital of the Non-Regulation Province of Assam in September 1874. The [[Lushai Hills]] were transferred to Assam in 1897.\nThe new Commissionership included the five districts of Assam proper ([[Undivided Kamrup district|Kamrup]], [[Nagaon]], [[Darrang]], [[Sibsagar]] and [[Lakhimpur district|Lakhimpur]]), [[Khasi-Jaintia Hills]], [[Garo Hills]], [[Naga Hills District, British India|Naga Hills]], [[Goalpara]] and [[Sylhet district|Sylhet]]-[[Cachar]] comprising about 54,100 sq miles.

The province was annulled in 1911 following a sustained mass protest campaign and on 1 April 1912 the two parts of Bengal were reunited and a new partition based on language followed, [[Oriya language|Oriya]] and [[Assamese language|Assamese]] areas were separated to form new administrative units: [[Bihar and Orissa Province]] was created to the west, and Assam Province to the east.\n\nBritish India's [[Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms]] enacted through the [[Government of India Act 1919]] expanded the Assam Legislative Council and introduced the principle of [[dyarchy]], whereby certain responsibilities such as agriculture, health, education, and local government, were transferred to elected ministers. Some of the Indian ministers under the dyarchy scheme were [[Muhammed Saadulah|Sir Syed Muhammad Saadulla]] (Education and Agriculture 1924-1934) and Rai Bahadur Promode Chandra Dutta (Local Self-government).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sharma|first1=Suresh|title=Documents on North-East India: Assam (1664-1935)|publisher=Mittal Publication|isbn=81-8324-089-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JCnLlpHhtUgC&pg=PA205}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Government of India Act 1935]] provided provincial autonomy and further enlarged the elected provincial legislature to 108 elected members.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://assamassembly.gov.in/mla-1937-46.html|title=Assam Legislative Assembly - MLA 1937-46|website=assamassembly.gov.in|accessdate=26 December 2019}}</ref> In 1937 elections were held for the newly created Assam Legislative Assembly established in Shillong. The [[Indian National Congress]] had the largest number of seats, with 38 members, but declined to form a government. Therefore, the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]]'s [[Muhammed Saadulah|Sir Syed Muhammad Saadulla]] was invited to form a ministry. Saadulla's government resigned in September 1938, after the Congress changed its decision, and the Governor, Sir Robert Neil Reid, then invited [[Gopinath Bordoloi]]. Bordoloi's cabinet included the future [[President of India]] [[Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed]]. In 1939, all of the Congress ministries in British Indian provinces resigned, and [[Muhammed Saadulah|Sir Syed Muhammad Saadulla]] was again invited to form a ministry.\n\nSaadulla remained the Premier (Chief Minister) of Assam up to 1946, bar a period of Governor's Rule from 24 December 1941 to 24 August 1942. During the [[Japanese invasion of India]] in 1944, some areas of Assam Province, including the [[Naga Hills District, British India|Naga Hills district]] and part of the [[Manipur (princely state)|Manipur princely state]], were occupied by Japanese forces between mid March and July.\n\nWhen fresh elections to the provincial legislatures were called in 1946, the Congress won a majority in Assam, and Bordoloi was again the Chief Minister. Prior to the [[Independence of India]], on 1 April 1946, Assam Province was granted self-rule and on 15 August 1947 it became part of the [[Indian Union]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldstatesmen.org/India_BrProvinces.htm|title=Provinces of British India|website=www.worldstatesmen.org|accessdate=26 December 2019}}</ref> Bordoloi continued as the Chief Minister even after India's [[Partition of India|independence]] in 1947.\n\n===Chief commissioners===\n*1912 - 1918                [[Archdale Earle]]                     (b. 1861 - d. 1934) \n*1918 -  3 Jan 1921         [[Nicholas Beatson-Bell|Sir Nicholas Dodd Beatson Bell]]     (b. 1867 - d. 1936)\n\n===Governors===\n{{see also|List of Governors of Assam}}\n* 3 Jan 1921 -  2 Apr 1921  [[Nicholas Beatson-Bell|Sir Nicholas Dodd Beatson Bell]]     (s.a.) \n* 3 Apr 1921 - 10 Oct 1922  Sir William Sinclair Marris        (b. 1873 - d. 1945) \n*10 Oct 1922 - 28 Jun 1927  Sir John Henry Kerr                (b. 1871 - d. 1934) \n*28 Jun 1927 - 11 May 1932  Sir Egbert Laurie Lucas Hammond    (b. 1873 - d. 1939) \n*11 May 1932 -  4 Mar 1937  Sir Michael Keane                  (b. 1874 - d. 1937) \n* 4 Mar 1937 -  4 May 1942  Robert Neil Reid                   (b. 1883 - d. 1964) \n* 4 May 1942 -  4 May 1947  Sir Andrew Gourlay Clow            (b. 1890 - d. 1957)\n*15 Mar 1944 - Jul 1944     Mutaguchi Renya                    (b. 1888 - d. 1966)  Mil (Japanese military commander)        \n*16 Mar 1944 - Jul 1944     A.C.

By the time that the network debuted, Cartoon Network also operated a programming block (containing its cartoons) that aired on TNT, entitled \"Cartoon Network on TNT\".\n\nCartoon Network was not the first [[cable channel]] to have relied on cartoons to attract an audience; however, it was the first 24-hour single-genre channel with animation as its main theme. Turner Broadcasting System had defied conventional wisdom before by launching [[CNN]], a channel providing 24-hour news coverage. The concept was previously thought unlikely to attract a sufficient audience to be particularly profitable, however the CNN experiment had been successful and Turner hoped that Cartoon Network would also find success.<ref name=\"Genre\">Mittell (2004), p. 80</ref>\n\nInitially, the channel would broadcast cartoons 24 hours a day. Most of the short cartoons were aired in half-hour or hour-long packages, usually separated by character or studio&nbsp;\u2013 ''Down Wit' Droopy D'' aired old [[Droopy|Droopy Dog]] shorts, ''The [[Tom and Jerry]] Show'' presented the classic cat-and-mouse team, and ''Bugs and Daffy Tonight'' provided classic [[Looney Tunes]] shorts. ''Late Night Black and White'' showed early [[black-and-white]] cartoons (mostly from the [[Fleischer Studios]] and [[Walter Lantz]] cartoons from the 1930s, as well as black-and-white Merrie Melodies and MGM cartoons), and ''[[ToonHeads]]'' would show three shorts with a similar theme and provide trivia about the cartoons.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} There was also an afternoon cartoon block called ''[[High Noon Toons]]'', which was hosted by cowboy hand puppets (an example of the simplicity and imagination the network had in its early years). The majority of the classic animation that was shown on Cartoon Network no longer airs on a regular basis, but ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' and ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', still aired and lasted until 2017.\n\nA challenge for Cartoon Network was to overcome its low penetration of existing cable systems. When launched on October 1, 1992, the channel was only carried by 233 cable systems. However, it benefited from [[Product bundling|package deals]]. New subscribers to sister channels [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] and [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] could also get access to Cartoon Network through such deals. The high ratings of Cartoon Network over the following couple of years led to more cable systems including it. By the end of 1994, Cartoon Network had become \"the fifth most popular cable channel in the United States\".<ref name=\"Genre\"/>\n\nFor the first few years of Cartoon Network's existence, programming meant for the channel would also be [[simulcast]] on TBS and/or TNT, both of which were still full-service cable networks that carried a variety of different programming genera, in order to increase the shows' (and Cartoon Network's) exposure; examples include ''[[The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest]]'', ''[[Cartoon Planet]]'', ''[[SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron]]'', and ''[[2 Stupid Dogs]]''.\n\nThe network's first exclusive original show was ''[[The Moxy Show]]'', an animation anthology series first airing in 1993.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cartoon Network Brings Some Fresh Faces to Life|url=https://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-02-12/features/9502120130_1_world-premiere-toons-powerpuff-girls-cels|first=Lee|last=Winfrey|date=February 12, 1995|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Media]]|accessdate=November 30, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513170405/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-02-12/features/9502120130_1_world-premiere-toons-powerpuff-girls-cels|archive-date=May 13, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The first series produced by Cartoon Network was ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'' in 1994, but the show mostly consisted of \"recycled animation cells\" from the archives of Hanna-Barbera, being an ironic [[deconstruction]] of a [[talk show]]. It featured live-action guests, mostly consisting of celebrities which were past their prime or [[counterculture]] figures. A running gag was that the production cost was dubbed \"minimal\". The series found its audience among young adults who appreciated its \"[[Hip (slang)|hip]]\" perspective.<ref name=\"Genre4\">Mittell (2004), p. 82-83</ref>\n\nKevin Sandler considered ''Space Ghost Coast to Coast'' instrumental in establishing Cartoon Network's appeal to older audiences. [[Space Ghost]], a 1960s [[superhero]] by Hanna-Barbera, was recast as the star of a [[talk show]] spoof. This was arguably the first time the network revived a \"classic animated icon\" in an entirely new context for comedic purposes. Grown-ups who had ceased enjoying the original takes on the characters could find amusement in the \"new ironic and self-referential context\" for them. Promotional shorts such as the \"Scooby-Doo Project\", a parody of ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'', gave similar treatments to the Scooby gang.<ref name=\"Prime Time2\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 98-99</ref> However, there were less successful efforts at such revivals. ''[[A Day in the Life of Ranger Smith]]'' and ''[[Boo Boo Runs Wild]]'' (1999) were short cartoons featuring new takes on [[Yogi Bear]]'s supporting cast by [[John Kricfalusi]]. Their style of humor, sexual content and break in tone from the source material was rather out of place among the rest of the Cartoon Network shows, and the network rarely found a place for them in its programming.<ref name=\"Prime Time3\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 100</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Hanna-Barbera's new division [[Cartoon Network Studios]] was founded and started production on ''[[What a Cartoon!]]'' (also known as ''World Premiere Toons'' and ''Cartoon Cartoons''). This show debuted in 1995, offering original animated shorts commissioned from Hanna-Barbera and various independent animators. The network promoted the series as an attempt to return to the \"classic days\" of studio animation, offering full animator control, high budgets, and no [[limited animation]]. The project was spearheaded by Cartoon Network executives, plus [[John Kricfalusi]] and [[Fred Seibert]]. Kricfalusi was the creator of  ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]'' and served as an advisor to the network, while Seibert was formerly one of the driving forces behind Nickelodeon's [[Nicktoons]] and would go on to produce the similar animation anthology series ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'' and ''[[Random! Cartoons]]''.<ref name=\"Genre4\"/><ref name=\"Seibert\">{{cite web|url=https://www.awn.com/articles/people/fred-seibert-interview-part-1|title=The Fred Seibert Interview&nbsp;\u2013 Part 1|first=Joe|last=Strike|date=July 15, 2003|publisher=Animation World Network|accessdate=August 30, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806012907/http://www.awn.com/articles/people/fred-seibert-interview-part-1|archive-date=August 6, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nCartoon Network was able to assess the potential of certain shorts to serve as pilots for spin-off series and signed contracts with their creators to create ongoing series.<ref name=\"Genre4\"/> ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'' was the most popular short series according to a vote held in 1995 and eventually became the first [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''What a Cartoon!'' in 1996. Three more series based on shorts debuted from 1997 to 1999: ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'', ''[[Cow and Chicken]]'', ''[[I Am Weasel]]'' (the latter two as segments of the same show; ''I Am Weasel'' was later spun off into a separate show), ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'', ''[[Courage the Cowardly Dog]]'', and ''[[Mike, Lu & Og]]''.<ref name=\"Genre4\"/><ref name=\"Seibert\"/><ref name=\"Mike, Lu And Og\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/95956-Mike_Lu_And_Og.html|title=Mike, Lu And Og (1996)&nbsp;\u2013 What A Cartoon!

[[Linda Simensky]], vice president of original animation, reminded adults and teenage girls that cartoons could appeal to them as well. Kevin Sandler's article of them claimed that these cartoons were both less \"[[Ribaldry|bawdy]]\" than their counterparts at [[Comedy Central]] and less \"[[Social responsibility|socially responsible]]\" than their counterparts at [[Nickelodeon]]. Sandler pointed to the whimsical rebelliousness, high rate of exaggeration and self-consciousness of the overall output each individual series managed.<ref name=\"Prime Time2\"/>\n\nIn 1995, Cartoon Network launched \"Cartoon Network Online\" as an [[AOL|America Online]] exclusive website.

That show was called ''[[Sunday Pants]]''; it first aired on the day of October 2, 2005. ''Sunday Pants'' varies on different types of animation, from traditional hand-drawn animation to Flash, or even CGI, possibly making it similar to other shows such as ''[[Liquid Television]]'' on [[MTV]] or ''[[KaBlam!]]'' on [[Nickelodeon]]. The show was created by Craig \"Sven\" Gordon and Stuart Hill, and was produced at Spitfire Studios. The show has a similar concept to ''What a Cartoon!'', except that the shorts are 1\u20133 minutes long and the show is squeezed to be 23 minutes (without commercials). There are animated and live-action intervals in-between shorts. The live-action ones are performed by American band The Slacks, while the animated ones are animated by WeFail. The show lasted for less than a month, with its final airing taking place on October 23, 2005. In January 2006, the show was announced to be returning the month after but said return never came to fruition and the series was ultimately cancelled.\n\nTwo new Cartoon Network original series premiered in 2006: ''[[Squirrel Boy]]'' and ''[[Class of 3000]]''.

(TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'', ''[[Power Players]]'', ''[[Total DramaRama]]'', ''[[DC Super Hero Girls (TV series)|DC Super Hero Girls]]'' and ''[[Unikitty!]]''. In the past, Cartoon Network has also produced live-action programming, such as the live-action/animated hybrids ''[[Out of Jimmy's Head]]'' and ''[[The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange]]'', and shows such as ''[[Level Up (U.S. TV series)|Level Up]]'', ''[[Tower Prep]],'' and ''[[Incredible Crew]]''.\n\nIn addition, Cartoon Network reruns various ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' cartoons, which have been in constant rotation from the network's launch in 1992 until 2017. In its early days, Cartoon Network benefited from having access to a large collection of animated programming, including the libraries of [[Warner Bros.]] (''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]''), [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' and other series), and [[Hanna-Barbera]] (''[[The Flintstones]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[Snorks]]'', and others). Turner's ownership of Hanna-Barbera gave the network access to an established animation studio, something chief rival Nickelodeon did not yet have.<ref name=\"Prime Time\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 98</ref> Most of these series were removed by 1999 and moved to Boomerang in 2000.\n\n===Original series===\n{{see also|Cartoon Cartoons}}\nMuch of Cartoon Network's original programming originates from the network's in-house studio, [[Cartoon Network Studios]]. Beginning as a division of [[Hanna-Barbera]], this studio would produce some of the network's earliest original series, including ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', ''[[Cow and Chicken]]'', ''[[I Am Weasel]]'', ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'', and ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]''. '''Cartoon Cartoons''' was once the branding for Cartoon Network's original [[animation|animated]] [[television show|television series]], but it has seldom been used by the network by 2003. The name was eventually discontinued in 2008.\n\n===Programming blocks===\nBy the early 2000s, Cartoon Network had established programming blocks aimed at different age demographics. The shows broadcast during the early morning had [[preschool]]ers as their target audience and mostly had [[prosocial behavior]] as a theme. The [[Toonami]] programming block, featured later in the day, mostly included anime shows and its target audience was [[preadolescence|tweens]] and [[Adolescence|teenagers]]. [[Prime time]] shows mostly included classic cartoons, featured as part of ''[[The Tex Avery Show]]'', ''[[The Chuck Jones Show]]'' and ''[[The Bob Clampett Show]]''. Preschool programming was discontinued by 2007.\n\n===Current programming blocks===\n'''''[[Adult Swim]]''''' \u2013 A night time program block aimed at young adults, which airs content that is not suitable for children. It does not feature any advertising for Cartoon Network programming and, due to its long runtime and different demographics, is branded as a separate channel. Adult Swim airs a mix of live-action and animated comedies, including both original series such as ''[[Rick and Morty]]'' and ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'', as well as acquired programming like [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] shows and Japanese [[anime]], aired under the [[Toonami]] branding since May 2012, every Saturday night. Adult Swim is currently  broadcast daily from 8:00&nbsp;p.m. to 6:00&nbsp;a.m.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adultswim.com/schedule|title=On-Air Schedule - Adult Swim|website=www.adultswim.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181103072509/https://www.adultswim.com/schedule/|archive-date=November 3, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> ET/PT; its starting time has changed various times, from 11:00&nbsp;p.m. to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. to 9:00&nbsp;p.m. and to 8:00&nbsp;p.m.\n\n==Marketing==\nCartoon Network shows with established fan followings, such as ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', allowed the network to pursue licensing agreements with companies interested in selling series-related merchandise. For example, agreements with [[Kraft Foods]] led to widespread in-store advertising for Cartoon Network-related products. The network also worked on cross-promotion campaigns with both Kraft and [[Tower Records]]. In product development and marketing, the network has benefited from its relation to corporate parent [[Time Warner]], allowing for mutually beneficial relationships with various subsidiary companies.<ref name=\"Prime Time5\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 101-102</ref>\n\n[[Time Warner Cable]], the former cable television subsidiary of the corporate parent (which was [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] from Time Warner in 2009), distributes Cartoon Network as part of its packages. [[Turner Broadcasting System]], the subsidiary overseeing various Time Warner-owned networks, helped cross-promote Cartoon Network shows and at times arranged for swapping certain shows between the networks. For example, ''[[Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends]]'', one of CN's original shows, was at times seen at [[Kids' WB]] (which was discontinued on May 24, 2008), while ''[[Xiaolin Showdown]]'' and ''[[\u00a1Mucha Lucha!]]'',two of Kids' WB!'s original shows, were seen at Cartoon Network. In each case, the swap intended to cultivate a shared audience for the two networks. [[Time Inc.]], the former subsidiary overseeing the magazines of the corporate parent, ensured favorable coverage of Cartoon Network and advertising space across its publications. Printed advertisements for CN shows could appear in magazines such as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' and ''[[Sports Illustrated Kids]]'' until Time Inc. was [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] from Time Warner on June 9, 2014. [[AOL]], a now-former sibling company to Time Warner covering Internet services, helped promote Cartoon Network shows online by offering exclusive content for certain animated series, online [[sweepstakes]] and [[display advertising]] for CN.<ref name=\"Prime Time5\"/>\n\n[[Warner Home Video]], the home video subsidiary, distributed VHS tapes, DVDs and [[Blu-ray Disc]]s featuring Cartoon Network shows. Select [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]] VHS releases came with bonus cartoons from Cartoon Network. [[Rhino Entertainment]], the former record label subsidiary of the corporate parent (which was [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] from Time Warner in 2004), distributed cassette tapes and CDs with Cartoon Network-related music. These products were also available through the [[Warner Bros. Studio Store]]. [[DC Comics]], the comic book subsidiary, published a series featuring the Powerpuff Girls, indicating it could handle other CN-related characters. [[Warner Bros.]], the film studio subsidiary, released ''[[The Powerpuff Girls Movie]]'' in 2002. Kevin Sandler considered it likely that this film would find its way to [[HBO]] or [[Cinemax]], two television network subsidiaries which regularly broadcast feature films. Sandler also viewed book [[tie-in]]s through [[Warner Books]] as likely, since it was the only area of marketing not covered yet by 2001.<ref name=\"Prime Time5\"/>\n\n==Editing of ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' shorts==\nCartoon Network has, during its history, broadcast most of the [[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography|Warner Bros. animated shorts]] originally created between the 1920s and the 1960s, but the network edited out scenes depicting discharge of gunfire, alcohol ingestion, cowboys and Indians gags, tobacco, and politically incorrect humor. The unedited versions were kept from both broadcasting and wide release on the video market. ''[[Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs]]'' (1943), a politically incorrect but critically well-regarded short, was notably omitted entirely, while ''[[The Scarlet Pumpernickel]]'' (1950) and ''[[Feed the Kitty]]'' (1952), both well-regarded, had their finales heavily edited due to violence.<ref name=\"Prime Time6\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 105-107</ref>\n\nThere was media attention in June 2001 over a network decision concerning further omissions from broadcasting. Cartoon Network formerly scheduled a 49-hour-long marathon annually known as ''June Bugs'', promising to broadcast every [[List of Bugs Bunny cartoons|Bugs Bunny animated short]] in chronological order. The network originally intended to include 12 shorts for its 2001 airing of the marathon (one of them part of the [[Censored Eleven]] list of ''Merrie Melodies'' and ''Looney Tunes'' cartoons effectively shelved from distribution) that had become controversial for using [[ethnic and national stereotypes]], albeit broadcasting them past midnight to ensure few children were watching, with introductions concerning their historic value as representatives of another time. The network's corporate parent considered it likely that there would be complaints concerning racial insensitivity. This led to all 12 being omitted in their entirety. Laurie Goldberg, vice-president of public relations, defended the decision, stating, \"We're the leader in animation, but we're also one of the top-rated general entertainment networks. There are certain responsibilities that come with that\".<ref name=\"Prime Time6\"/>\n\n==Related projects==\n\n===Adult Swim===\n{{Main|Adult Swim}}\n\nAdult Swim (often stylized as [adult swim] or [as]) is a teen/adult-oriented nighttime programming service that airs on Cartoon Network from usually 8:00 PM to 6:00 AM [[Eastern time|ET]]/[[Pacific time|PT]] everyday in the United States, and broadcasts in countries such as [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]; Adult Swim is treated by [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] as a separate network in its ratings reports (similar to the company's ratings treatment of [[Nickelodeon]], [[Nick at Nite]] and the now-defunct [[Nickmom]]) due to differing target demographics between it and Cartoon Network.<ref name=\"as_split\"/> The network features myriad stylistically variable animated and live-action shows, including original programming, [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] shows mainly consisting of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] animated programming, and Japanese [[anime]], generally with minimal or no editing for content. The programs featured on Adult Swim are geared toward a mature audience, in contrast to the originally all-ages young teen and preteen daytime programming on Cartoon Network. Adult Swim moved its start time up an hour at 8pm on March 31, 2014. The 8pm hour was given back to Cartoon Network on numerous occasions, however, which used it to premiere ''[[Stakes (miniseries)|Adventure Time: Stakes]]'' in 2015, new episodes of the [[Regular Show (season 8)|eighth season]] of ''[[Regular Show]]'' in 2016, new episodes of the [[The Amazing World of Gumball (season 6)|sixth season]] of ''[[The Amazing World of Gumball]]'' in 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/2019/11/20/steven-universe-future-official-trailer |title=Steven Universe Future Releases First Official Trailer |work=ComicBook.com |first=Rollin |last=Bishop |date=November 20, 2019 |accessdate=November 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Toonami===\n{{Main|Toonami}}\nToonami (a portmanteau of \"cartoon\" and \"[[tsunami]]\", suggesting a \"tidal wave\" of animated cartoons) is a brand of Cartoon Network, used initially for action-oriented programming blocks on Cartoon Network television channels worldwide, mostly showing American cartoons and Japanese anime, originating in the United States on March 17, 1997, and ending on September 20, 2008. It was revived on May 26, 2012, as a Saturday night anime block on Adult Swim, reclaiming their Saturday anime lineup, similar to its previous mature-geared \"Midnight Run\" incarnation which was that block's forerunner. The host was a muscular teenage robot named TOM, voiced by [[Steven Blum]].\n\nThe Toonami brand was subsequently used in the United Kingdom as the name of an action-oriented animation channel with two CGI hosts. It replaced a former Cartoon Network-owned channel, CNX, which had been a Toonami/live-action hybrid network.\n\nToonami was launched as a 24-hour channel in [[Toonami (Southeast Asia)|Asia]] in December 2012, in [[Toonami (India)|India]] in February 2015 and in [[Toonami (France)|France]] in February 2016. \"It really is the ultimate home of the action hero,\" said Sunny Saha from Turner International.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k12/nov/nov211.php|title=Indian Television Dot Com&nbsp;\u2014 Toonami to launch in Hong Kong on 1 December|author=Anil Wanvari|work=indiantelevision.com|access-date=July 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701085333/http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k12/nov/nov211.php|archive-date=July 1, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Boomerang===\n{{Main|Boomerang (TV network)}}\nBoomerang began as a programming block on Cartoon Network on December 8, 1992, and continued until October 2004, aimed towards the [[Baby boomer|Baby Boom]] generation.

By the time that the network debuted, Cartoon Network also operated a programming block (containing its cartoons) that aired on TNT, entitled \"Cartoon Network on TNT\".\n\nCartoon Network was not the first [[cable channel]] to have relied on cartoons to attract an audience; however, it was the first 24-hour single-genre channel with animation as its main theme. Turner Broadcasting System had defied conventional wisdom before by launching [[CNN]], a channel providing 24-hour news coverage. The concept was previously thought unlikely to attract a sufficient audience to be particularly profitable, however the CNN experiment had been successful and Turner hoped that Cartoon Network would also find success.<ref name=\"Genre\">Mittell (2004), p. 80</ref>\n\nInitially, the channel would broadcast cartoons 24 hours a day. Most of the short cartoons were aired in half-hour or hour-long packages, usually separated by character or studio&nbsp;\u2013 ''Down Wit' Droopy D'' aired old [[Droopy|Droopy Dog]] shorts, ''The [[Tom and Jerry]] Show'' presented the classic cat-and-mouse team, and ''Bugs and Daffy Tonight'' provided classic [[Looney Tunes]] shorts. ''Late Night Black and White'' showed early [[black-and-white]] cartoons (mostly from the [[Fleischer Studios]] and [[Walter Lantz]] cartoons from the 1930s, as well as black-and-white Merrie Melodies and MGM cartoons), and ''[[ToonHeads]]'' would show three shorts with a similar theme and provide trivia about the cartoons.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} There was also an afternoon cartoon block called ''[[High Noon Toons]]'', which was hosted by cowboy hand puppets (an example of the simplicity and imagination the network had in its early years). The majority of the classic animation that was shown on Cartoon Network no longer airs on a regular basis, but ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' and ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', still aired and lasted until 2017.\n\nA challenge for Cartoon Network was to overcome its low penetration of existing cable systems. When launched on October 1, 1992, the channel was only carried by 233 cable systems. However, it benefited from [[Product bundling|package deals]]. New subscribers to sister channels [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] and [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] could also get access to Cartoon Network through such deals. The high ratings of Cartoon Network over the following couple of years led to more cable systems including it. By the end of 1994, Cartoon Network had become \"the fifth most popular cable channel in the United States\".<ref name=\"Genre\"/>\n\nFor the first few years of Cartoon Network's existence, programming meant for the channel would also be [[simulcast]] on TBS and/or TNT, both of which were still full-service cable networks that carried a variety of different programming genera, in order to increase the shows' (and Cartoon Network's) exposure; examples include ''[[The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest]]'', ''[[Cartoon Planet]]'', ''[[SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron]]'', and ''[[2 Stupid Dogs]]''.\n\nThe network's first exclusive original show was ''[[The Moxy Show]]'', an animation anthology series first airing in 1993.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cartoon Network Brings Some Fresh Faces to Life|url=https://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-02-12/features/9502120130_1_world-premiere-toons-powerpuff-girls-cels|first=Lee|last=Winfrey|date=February 12, 1995|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Media]]|accessdate=November 30, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513170405/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-02-12/features/9502120130_1_world-premiere-toons-powerpuff-girls-cels|archive-date=May 13, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The first series produced by Cartoon Network was ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'' in 1994, but the show mostly consisted of \"recycled animation cells\" from the archives of Hanna-Barbera, being an ironic [[deconstruction]] of a [[talk show]]. It featured live-action guests, mostly consisting of celebrities which were past their prime or [[counterculture]] figures. A running gag was that the production cost was dubbed \"minimal\". The series found its audience among young adults who appreciated its \"[[Hip (slang)|hip]]\" perspective.<ref name=\"Genre4\">Mittell (2004), p. 82-83</ref>\n\nKevin Sandler considered ''Space Ghost Coast to Coast'' instrumental in establishing Cartoon Network's appeal to older audiences. [[Space Ghost]], a 1960s [[superhero]] by Hanna-Barbera, was recast as the star of a [[talk show]] spoof. This was arguably the first time the network revived a \"classic animated icon\" in an entirely new context for comedic purposes. Grown-ups who had ceased enjoying the original takes on the characters could find amusement in the \"new ironic and self-referential context\" for them. Promotional shorts such as the \"Scooby-Doo Project\", a parody of ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'', gave similar treatments to the Scooby gang.<ref name=\"Prime Time2\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 98-99</ref> However, there were less successful efforts at such revivals. ''[[A Day in the Life of Ranger Smith]]'' and ''[[Boo Boo Runs Wild]]'' (1999) were short cartoons featuring new takes on [[Yogi Bear]]'s supporting cast by [[John Kricfalusi]]. Their style of humor, sexual content and break in tone from the source material was rather out of place among the rest of the Cartoon Network shows, and the network rarely found a place for them in its programming.<ref name=\"Prime Time3\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 100</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Hanna-Barbera's new division [[Cartoon Network Studios]] was founded and started production on ''[[What a Cartoon!]]'' (also known as ''World Premiere Toons'' and ''Cartoon Cartoons''). This show debuted in 1995, offering original animated shorts commissioned from Hanna-Barbera and various independent animators. The network promoted the series as an attempt to return to the \"classic days\" of studio animation, offering full animator control, high budgets, and no [[limited animation]]. The project was spearheaded by Cartoon Network executives, plus [[John Kricfalusi]] and [[Fred Seibert]]. Kricfalusi was the creator of  ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]'' and served as an advisor to the network, while Seibert was formerly one of the driving forces behind Nickelodeon's [[Nicktoons]] and would go on to produce the similar animation anthology series ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'' and ''[[Random!

Three more series based on shorts debuted from 1997 to 1999: ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'', ''[[Cow and Chicken]]'', ''[[I Am Weasel]]'' (the latter two as segments of the same show; ''I Am Weasel'' was later spun off into a separate show), ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'', ''[[Courage the Cowardly Dog]]'', and ''[[Mike, Lu & Og]]''.<ref name=\"Genre4\"/><ref name=\"Seibert\"/><ref name=\"Mike, Lu And Og\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/95956-Mike_Lu_And_Og.html|title=Mike, Lu And Og (1996)&nbsp;\u2013 What A Cartoon!

[[Linda Simensky]], vice president of original animation, reminded adults and teenage girls that cartoons could appeal to them as well. Kevin Sandler's article of them claimed that these cartoons were both less \"[[Ribaldry|bawdy]]\" than their counterparts at [[Comedy Central]] and less \"[[Social responsibility|socially responsible]]\" than their counterparts at [[Nickelodeon]]. Sandler pointed to the whimsical rebelliousness, high rate of exaggeration and self-consciousness of the overall output each individual series managed.<ref name=\"Prime Time2\"/>\n\nIn 1995, Cartoon Network launched \"Cartoon Network Online\" as an [[AOL|America Online]] exclusive website. It would later merge with ghostplanet.com as simply \"CartoonNetwork.com\", and featured games, videos, shopping, [[Cartoon Orbit]], which launched in 2000, and even promotions to movies, video games, food items, toys, etc., such as [[Campbell's Soup]], ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'', the original ''[[Spy Kids]]'' trilogy, ''[[The Cat in the Hat (film)|the Cat in the Hat]]'', [[Juicy Drop Pop]], [[Wonder Ball]], ''[[Hot Wheels]]'', and so many more. In addition, CartoonNetwork.com also ran Cartoon Network's first online original series ''Web Premiere Toons'', which mostly featured interactive web cartoons that ran from 1999 to 2002.\n\nIn 1996, Cartoon Network decided to air preschool programming and air them every Sunday morning, such as hiring [[Sesame Workshop|Children's Television Workshop]], the makers of ''[[Sesame Street]]'' on [[PBS Kids]], to make a show called ''[[Big Bag]]'', a live-action/puppet television program targeted at pre-school viewers, as well as ''[[Small World (U.S. TV series)|Small World]]'', a children's animated anthology show and variety show, in which showcased featured several segments from animated TV programs aimed at preschoolers from several countries around the world except for Japan, China, and Korea. ''Big Bag'' ran until 1998, and ''Small World'' ran until 2001.\n\nIn 1996, Turner Broadcasting System merged with [[Time Warner]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Turner To Merge Into Time Warner; A $7.5 Billion Deal|first=Mark|last=Lander|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/23/us/turner-to-merge-into-time-warner-a-7.5-billion-deal.html|date=September 23, 1995|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=July 30, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513030130/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/23/us/turner-to-merge-into-time-warner-a-7.5-billion-deal.html|archive-date=May 13, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> (ironically, Time Warner's predecessor [[Warner Communications]] had created rival [[Nickelodeon]], now owned by [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]], in 1977).

That show was called ''[[Sunday Pants]]''; it first aired on the day of October 2, 2005. ''Sunday Pants'' varies on different types of animation, from traditional hand-drawn animation to Flash, or even CGI, possibly making it similar to other shows such as ''[[Liquid Television]]'' on [[MTV]] or ''[[KaBlam!]]'' on [[Nickelodeon]]. The show was created by Craig \"Sven\" Gordon and Stuart Hill, and was produced at Spitfire Studios. The show has a similar concept to ''What a Cartoon!'', except that the shorts are 1\u20133 minutes long and the show is squeezed to be 23 minutes (without commercials). There are animated and live-action intervals in-between shorts. The live-action ones are performed by American band The Slacks, while the animated ones are animated by WeFail. The show lasted for less than a month, with its final airing taking place on October 23, 2005. In January 2006, the show was announced to be returning the month after but said return never came to fruition and the series was ultimately cancelled.\n\nTwo new Cartoon Network original series premiered in 2006: ''[[Squirrel Boy]]'' and ''[[Class of 3000]]''.

(TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'', ''[[Power Players]]'', ''[[Total DramaRama]]'', ''[[DC Super Hero Girls (TV series)|DC Super Hero Girls]]'' and ''[[Unikitty!]]''. In the past, Cartoon Network has also produced live-action programming, such as the live-action/animated hybrids ''[[Out of Jimmy's Head]]'' and ''[[The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange]]'', and shows such as ''[[Level Up (U.S. TV series)|Level Up]]'', ''[[Tower Prep]],'' and ''[[Incredible Crew]]''.\n\nIn addition, Cartoon Network reruns various ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' cartoons, which have been in constant rotation from the network's launch in 1992 until 2017. In its early days, Cartoon Network benefited from having access to a large collection of animated programming, including the libraries of [[Warner Bros.]] (''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]''), [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' and other series), and [[Hanna-Barbera]] (''[[The Flintstones]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[Snorks]]'', and others). Turner's ownership of Hanna-Barbera gave the network access to an established animation studio, something chief rival Nickelodeon did not yet have.<ref name=\"Prime Time\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 98</ref> Most of these series were removed by 1999 and moved to Boomerang in 2000.\n\n===Original series===\n{{see also|Cartoon Cartoons}}\nMuch of Cartoon Network's original programming originates from the network's in-house studio, [[Cartoon Network Studios]]. Beginning as a division of [[Hanna-Barbera]], this studio would produce some of the network's earliest original series, including ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', ''[[Cow and Chicken]]'', ''[[I Am Weasel]]'', ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'', and ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]''. '''Cartoon Cartoons''' was once the branding for Cartoon Network's original [[animation|animated]] [[television show|television series]], but it has seldom been used by the network by 2003. The name was eventually discontinued in 2008.\n\n===Programming blocks===\nBy the early 2000s, Cartoon Network had established programming blocks aimed at different age demographics. The shows broadcast during the early morning had [[preschool]]ers as their target audience and mostly had [[prosocial behavior]] as a theme. The [[Toonami]] programming block, featured later in the day, mostly included anime shows and its target audience was [[preadolescence|tweens]] and [[Adolescence|teenagers]]. [[Prime time]] shows mostly included classic cartoons, featured as part of ''[[The Tex Avery Show]]'', ''[[The Chuck Jones Show]]'' and ''[[The Bob Clampett Show]]''. Preschool programming was discontinued by 2007.\n\n===Current programming blocks===\n'''''[[Adult Swim]]''''' \u2013 A night time program block aimed at young adults, which airs content that is not suitable for children. It does not feature any advertising for Cartoon Network programming and, due to its long runtime and different demographics, is branded as a separate channel. Adult Swim airs a mix of live-action and animated comedies, including both original series such as ''[[Rick and Morty]]'' and ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'', as well as acquired programming like [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] shows and Japanese [[anime]], aired under the [[Toonami]] branding since May 2012, every Saturday night. Adult Swim is currently  broadcast daily from 8:00&nbsp;p.m. to 6:00&nbsp;a.m.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adultswim.com/schedule|title=On-Air Schedule - Adult Swim|website=www.adultswim.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181103072509/https://www.adultswim.com/schedule/|archive-date=November 3, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> ET/PT; its starting time has changed various times, from 11:00&nbsp;p.m. to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. to 9:00&nbsp;p.m. and to 8:00&nbsp;p.m.\n\n==Marketing==\nCartoon Network shows with established fan followings, such as ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', allowed the network to pursue licensing agreements with companies interested in selling series-related merchandise. For example, agreements with [[Kraft Foods]] led to widespread in-store advertising for Cartoon Network-related products. The network also worked on cross-promotion campaigns with both Kraft and [[Tower Records]]. In product development and marketing, the network has benefited from its relation to corporate parent [[Time Warner]], allowing for mutually beneficial relationships with various subsidiary companies.<ref name=\"Prime Time5\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 101-102</ref>\n\n[[Time Warner Cable]], the former cable television subsidiary of the corporate parent (which was [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] from Time Warner in 2009), distributes Cartoon Network as part of its packages. [[Turner Broadcasting System]], the subsidiary overseeing various Time Warner-owned networks, helped cross-promote Cartoon Network shows and at times arranged for swapping certain shows between the networks. For example, ''[[Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends]]'', one of CN's original shows, was at times seen at [[Kids' WB]] (which was discontinued on May 24, 2008), while ''[[Xiaolin Showdown]]'' and ''[[\u00a1Mucha Lucha!]]'',two of Kids' WB!'s original shows, were seen at Cartoon Network. In each case, the swap intended to cultivate a shared audience for the two networks. [[Time Inc.]], the former subsidiary overseeing the magazines of the corporate parent, ensured favorable coverage of Cartoon Network and advertising space across its publications. Printed advertisements for CN shows could appear in magazines such as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' and ''[[Sports Illustrated Kids]]'' until Time Inc. was [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] from Time Warner on June 9, 2014. [[AOL]], a now-former sibling company to Time Warner covering Internet services, helped promote Cartoon Network shows online by offering exclusive content for certain animated series, online [[sweepstakes]] and [[display advertising]] for CN.<ref name=\"Prime Time5\"/>\n\n[[Warner Home Video]], the home video subsidiary, distributed VHS tapes, DVDs and [[Blu-ray Disc]]s featuring Cartoon Network shows. Select [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]] VHS releases came with bonus cartoons from Cartoon Network. [[Rhino Entertainment]], the former record label subsidiary of the corporate parent (which was [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] from Time Warner in 2004), distributed cassette tapes and CDs with Cartoon Network-related music. These products were also available through the [[Warner Bros. Studio Store]]. [[DC Comics]], the comic book subsidiary, published a series featuring the Powerpuff Girls, indicating it could handle other CN-related characters. [[Warner Bros.]], the film studio subsidiary, released ''[[The Powerpuff Girls Movie]]'' in 2002. Kevin Sandler considered it likely that this film would find its way to [[HBO]] or [[Cinemax]], two television network subsidiaries which regularly broadcast feature films. Sandler also viewed book [[tie-in]]s through [[Warner Books]] as likely, since it was the only area of marketing not covered yet by 2001.<ref name=\"Prime Time5\"/>\n\n==Editing of ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' shorts==\nCartoon Network has, during its history, broadcast most of the [[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography|Warner Bros. animated shorts]] originally created between the 1920s and the 1960s, but the network edited out scenes depicting discharge of gunfire, alcohol ingestion, cowboys and Indians gags, tobacco, and politically incorrect humor. The unedited versions were kept from both broadcasting and wide release on the video market. ''[[Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs]]'' (1943), a politically incorrect but critically well-regarded short, was notably omitted entirely, while ''[[The Scarlet Pumpernickel]]'' (1950) and ''[[Feed the Kitty]]'' (1952), both well-regarded, had their finales heavily edited due to violence.<ref name=\"Prime Time6\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 105-107</ref>\n\nThere was media attention in June 2001 over a network decision concerning further omissions from broadcasting. Cartoon Network formerly scheduled a 49-hour-long marathon annually known as ''June Bugs'', promising to broadcast every [[List of Bugs Bunny cartoons|Bugs Bunny animated short]] in chronological order. The network originally intended to include 12 shorts for its 2001 airing of the marathon (one of them part of the [[Censored Eleven]] list of ''Merrie Melodies'' and ''Looney Tunes'' cartoons effectively shelved from distribution) that had become controversial for using [[ethnic and national stereotypes]], albeit broadcasting them past midnight to ensure few children were watching, with introductions concerning their historic value as representatives of another time. The network's corporate parent considered it likely that there would be complaints concerning racial insensitivity. This led to all 12 being omitted in their entirety. Laurie Goldberg, vice-president of public relations, defended the decision, stating, \"We're the leader in animation, but we're also one of the top-rated general entertainment networks. There are certain responsibilities that come with that\".<ref name=\"Prime Time6\"/>\n\n==Related projects==\n\n===Adult Swim===\n{{Main|Adult Swim}}\n\nAdult Swim (often stylized as [adult swim] or [as]) is a teen/adult-oriented nighttime programming service that airs on Cartoon Network from usually 8:00 PM to 6:00 AM [[Eastern time|ET]]/[[Pacific time|PT]] everyday in the United States, and broadcasts in countries such as [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]; Adult Swim is treated by [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] as a separate network in its ratings reports (similar to the company's ratings treatment of [[Nickelodeon]], [[Nick at Nite]] and the now-defunct [[Nickmom]]) due to differing target demographics between it and Cartoon Network.<ref name=\"as_split\"/> The network features myriad stylistically variable animated and live-action shows, including original programming, [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] shows mainly consisting of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] animated programming, and Japanese [[anime]], generally with minimal or no editing for content. The programs featured on Adult Swim are geared toward a mature audience, in contrast to the originally all-ages young teen and preteen daytime programming on Cartoon Network. Adult Swim moved its start time up an hour at 8pm on March 31, 2014. The 8pm hour was given back to Cartoon Network on numerous occasions, however, which used it to premiere ''[[Stakes (miniseries)|Adventure Time: Stakes]]'' in 2015, new episodes of the [[Regular Show (season 8)|eighth season]] of ''[[Regular Show]]'' in 2016, new episodes of the [[The Amazing World of Gumball (season 6)|sixth season]] of ''[[The Amazing World of Gumball]]'' in 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/2019/11/20/steven-universe-future-official-trailer |title=Steven Universe Future Releases First Official Trailer |work=ComicBook.com |first=Rollin |last=Bishop |date=November 20, 2019 |accessdate=November 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Toonami===\n{{Main|Toonami}}\nToonami (a portmanteau of \"cartoon\" and \"[[tsunami]]\", suggesting a \"tidal wave\" of animated cartoons) is a brand of Cartoon Network, used initially for action-oriented programming blocks on Cartoon Network television channels worldwide, mostly showing American cartoons and Japanese anime, originating in the United States on March 17, 1997, and ending on September 20, 2008. It was revived on May 26, 2012, as a Saturday night anime block on Adult Swim, reclaiming their Saturday anime lineup, similar to its previous mature-geared \"Midnight Run\" incarnation which was that block's forerunner. The host was a muscular teenage robot named TOM, voiced by [[Steven Blum]].\n\nThe Toonami brand was subsequently used in the United Kingdom as the name of an action-oriented animation channel with two CGI hosts. It replaced a former Cartoon Network-owned channel, CNX, which had been a Toonami/live-action hybrid network.\n\nToonami was launched as a 24-hour channel in [[Toonami (Southeast Asia)|Asia]] in December 2012, in [[Toonami (India)|India]] in February 2015 and in [[Toonami (France)|France]] in February 2016. \"It really is the ultimate home of the action hero,\" said Sunny Saha from Turner International.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k12/nov/nov211.php|title=Indian Television Dot Com&nbsp;\u2014 Toonami to launch in Hong Kong on 1 December|author=Anil Wanvari|work=indiantelevision.com|access-date=July 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701085333/http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k12/nov/nov211.php|archive-date=July 1, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Boomerang===\n{{Main|Boomerang (TV network)}}\nBoomerang began as a programming block on Cartoon Network on December 8, 1992, and continued until October 2004, aimed towards the [[Baby boomer|Baby Boom]] generation.
