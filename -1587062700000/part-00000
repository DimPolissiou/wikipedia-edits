Wagner later began publishing regional editions of ''The TeleVision Guide'' for [[New England]] and the [[Baltimore]]\u2013[[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] area.

Then, beginning with the July 17\u201323, 1954, issue, the listings in each week's issue changed to start on Saturday and end on Friday, which remained the listings format for all local editions until April 2004.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} The formation of ''TV Guide'' as a national publication resulted from Triangle Publications' purchase of numerous regional television listing publications such as ''TV Forecast'' (which was circulated in the [[Chicago]] area and, upon its first publication on May 9, 1948, was the first continuously published television listings magazine), ''TV Digest'' (which was distributed in [[Philadelphia]] and [[Pittsburgh]], and was originally distributed under the title, the ''Local Televiser'', when it was first released on November 7, 1948), and the New York-based ''Television Guide'' (which had its title abbreviated to ''TV Guide'' on March 18, 1950).<ref>{{cite web|title=1946-1949 \"TV Forecast\": Telling the Public About What's On the Air|url=http://www.tvhistory.tv/tv_forecast.htm|website=TVHistory.tv|accessdate=June 5, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Pre-National TV-Magazine Launch Dates|url=http://www.tvhistory.tv/Pre%20Nat%20TV%20Guide%20Timetable.htm|website=TVHistory.tv|accessdate=June 5, 2018}}</ref> Each of the cities that had their own local TV listings magazine folded into ''TV Guide'' were among the initial cities where the magazine conducted its national launch.\n\nThe launch as a national magazine with local listings in April 1953 became an almost instant success; however, the circulation decreased over subsequent weeks, even as the magazine's distribution expanded to five additional cities (Pittsburgh, [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[Detroit]], [[Cleveland]] and [[San Francisco]]) throughout the summer of 1953. By mid-August of that year, sales of the magazine had dropped 200,000 copies below that of the first issue. ''TV Guide''{{'}}s fortunes began to turn around with the September 4\u201310, 1953, issue \u2013 the magazine's first \"Fall Preview\" issue \u2013 when circulation hit 1,746,327 copies; circulation levels increased steadily over time, to the point where ''TV Guide'' eventually became the most read and circulated magazine in the United States by the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|title=National TV Guide -  The First Years|url=http://www.tvhistory.tv/tv_guide1.htm|website=TVHistory.tv|accessdate=June 5, 2018}}</ref> The initial cost of each issue was 15\u00a2 per copy (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|0.15|1953|r=2|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}; the price of each issue has gradually risen over the years, selling for $4.99 per copy as of {{currentyear}}). In addition to [[subscription business model|subscriptions]], ''TV Guide'' was sold at the checkout counters of [[grocery store]]s nationwide. Until the 1980s, the feature pieces included in each issue were promoted in a [[television commercial]]. Under Triangle, ''TV Guide'' continued to grow not only in circulation, but in recognition as the authority on television programming with articles \u2013 the majority of which typically appear in the color section \u2013 from both staff and contributing writers.\n\n[[File:Historic TV Guide logos.png|345px|thumb|left|Past logos used by the publication (l\u2013r): 1953\u20131962, 1962\u20131968, 1968\u20131988 and 1988\u20132003.]]\nOver the decades, the shape of the ''TV Guide'' logo has changed to reflect the modernization of the [[television set|television screen]], eventually adopting a [[widescreen]] appearance in September 2003, and then to its current flatscreen appearance in September 2016 (different versions of the logo \u2013 the only cosmetic difference being the utilization of different typefaces \u2013 are currently used respectively for the magazine and the separately owned, CBS-managed digital properties). At first, the logo had various colored backgrounds (usually black, white, blue or green) until the familiar red background became the standard in the 1960s with occasional customizations being utilized for special editions.\n\n[[File:TV Guide first issue.png|225px|thumb|right|The first issue of ''TV Guide'' (April 3, 1953), featuring [[Desi Arnaz Jr.]], the youngest of [[Lucille Ball]] (seen at upper right inset) and [[Desi Arnaz]]'s two children; Ball's pregnancy with Arnaz Jr. was incorporated into her ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' character's storyline, with his January 1953 birth coinciding with that of the fictional \"Little Ricky\" Ricardo.]]\nThe magazine was first based in a small office in downtown Philadelphia, before moving to more spacious national headquarters in [[Radnor Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Radnor]], [[Pennsylvania]], in the late 1950s. The new facility, complete with a large lighted ''TV Guide'' logo at the building's entrance, based its management, editors, production personnel and subscription processors as well as a vast computer system holding data on every television show and movie available for listing in the popular weekly publication. Printing of the national color section of ''TV Guide'' \u2013 which incorporates television-related stories, and select feature columns such as program reviews \u2013 took place at Triangle's Gravure Division plant \u2013 which was known for performing some of the highest quality printing in the industry, with almost always perfect registration \u2013 located adjacent to the company's landmark [[Inquirer Building]] on North [[Broad Street (Philadelphia)|Broad Street]] in Philadelphia. The color section was then sent to regional printers to be wrapped around the local listing sections.\n\nIn addition to ''TV Guide'' and its flagship newspaper ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', Triangle Publications also owned the ''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]''; ten radio and six television stations ([[WFIL|WFIL AM]]-[[WBEB|FM]]-[[WPVI-TV|TV]] in Philadelphia, WNHC [[WYBC (AM)|AM]]-[[WPLR|FM]]-[[WTNH|TV]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], KFRE [[KWRU|AM]]-[[KSKS|FM]]-[[KFSN-TV|TV]] in [[Fresno, California]], [[WNBF|WNBF AM]]-[[WHWK|FM]]-[[WBNG|TV]] in [[Binghamton, New York]], [[WFBG|WFBG AM]]-[[WFGY|FM]]-[[WTAJ-TV|TV]] in [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]] and [[WXBU|WLYH-TV]] in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]]\u2013[[Lebanon, Pennsylvania]]);, ''[[The Atlantic]]'',''[[Star & Sky]]'', ''[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]'', ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', [[Elementary Electronics]]'', ''[[Playboy]]'', ''[[A+ (magazine)|A+]]'' the Apple Computer Magazine from the 1980s'', ''[[The Daily Racing Form]]''; ''The Morning Telegraph''; ''[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]''; and various [[cable television]] interests. (It was under Triangle's ownership of WFIL-TV that ''[[American Bandstand]]'' came to popularity, which, in turn, led to host [[Dick Clark]] ascending to become a major television personality.) Triangle Publications sold its Philadelphia newspapers to [[Knight Ridder|Knight Newspapers]] in 1969, its radio and television stations during the early 1970s to [[Capital Cities/ABC Inc.|Capital Cities Communications]] (the television stations that are now known as KFSN-TV and WPVI-TV were subsequently acquired by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] through its 1986 merger with Capital Cities) and various other interests, retaining only ''TV Guide'', ''Seventeen'' and ''The Daily Racing Form''.\n\nFor the magazine's first 52 years of publication, listings information was displayed in a \"log\" format, a mainly text-based list of programs organized by both start time and channel, which was the sole method \u2013 eventually, primary once [[prime time]] [[Grid (graphic design)|grids]] were incorporated, and later secondary for the final two years of its inclusion of local listings \u2013 of displaying program information in ''TV Guide'' until the switch to national listings in 2005; this allowed for the display of full titles for each program as well as the inclusion of synopses for movies and most programs. Most listing entries in the log included program genres (and for national news programs, [[news presenter|anchors]]) after the program's title, while its running time (which was mentioned only if a program lasted a minimum of one hour \u2013 later 35 minutes \u2013 in length) was listed (in hours and minutes) in the synopses.\n\nChannel numbers were set in a tiny round icon (known as a \"bullet\") at the beginning of the listing; this bullet was soon modified to be the shape of a TV screen, similar to the shape of the ''TV Guide'' logo. In most editions, stations serving a particular edition's immediate local coverage area were denoted with a white numeral for its channel number set inside a black TV-shaped bullet; stations serving neighboring communities outside the immediate area, but which could also be viewed in the primary local area, were denoted with a black numeral inside a white TV-shaped bullet outlined in black (for example, in the [[San Francisco Bay Area|San Francisco]] edition, stations based in San Francisco or Oakland had their channel numbers listed as white-on-black TV-shaped bullets, while stations serving neighboring [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] or [[Salinas, California|Salinas]]/[[Monterey, California|Monterey]] (but could still be viewed in parts of San Francisco or Oakland, including their suburbs, as fringe reception) had their channel numbers listed as black-on-white icons). A particular listing could begin with as many as three or more channel bullets depending upon the number of stations in the immediate and surrounding areas broadcasting the same program at that particular time (usually different affiliates of the same network, based in the primary city as well as in neighboring areas). See the subsection \"[[TV Guide#Listings section|Listings section]],\" in the \"Editions\" section below, for a detailed explanation.\n\nOriginally, the majority of programs listed in the log each issue featured brief synopses, except for local and national newscasts, and programs airing on certain stations in various timeslots. As other [[terrestrial television|broadcast]] [[television station]]s and [[cable channel]]s were added, due to set space requirements for the local listings section, detailed synopses were gradually restricted to series and [[television special|specials]] \u2013 usually those airing in evening \"[[prime time]]\" timeslots \u2013 as well as movies airing on broadcast television, while shorter synopses were used for programs seen on broadcast stations outside of the edition's home market and select cable channels; and only the title along with basic supplementary information (such as genre and/or program length) for most other broadcast and cable programs. In addition, black-and-white ads for programs scheduled to air on broadcast stations \u2013 and later, cable channels \u2013 during prime time (with local airtimes, and for broadcast stations, information for [[network affiliate|network-affiliated stations]] featured in the edition which were scheduled to air the advertised show) were included within the listings. Ads for major network programs were generally produced by the networks themselves (and often, the networks would run a full-page or even a [[Double truck|double-truck]] ad for an entire night of programming, or for a major movie or special, or for the season premiere of a [[Saturday-morning cartoon|Saturday morning cartoon]] lineup); ads for locally produced programs, including local newscasts, were produced by individual stations (network affiliates as well as independent stations). Such locally provided ads almost always used the distinctive logos used by particular stations (for example, the \"Circle 7\" logo used for many years primarily by stations either owned by, or affiliated with, ABC). (Black-and-white ads for general products, services and special offers, similar to those seen in other national magazines, were also placed in the listings section.)\n\nA regular feature of the listings section was \"Close-Up,\" usually a half-page segment, which provided expanded reviews of select programs airing each day (various editions of \"Close-Up\" were eventually used for different types of programs, from premieres of new series to shows airing on cable). Over time, other regular and recurring features (most of them television-related) were included alongside the listings including \"Insider\" (a television news and interview section in the lead pages of the color section); \"Cheers and Jeers\" (a critique page about various aspects of television programming); \"Hits and Misses\" (featuring brief reviews of select programs in the coming week, rated on a score from 0 to 10); \"Guidelines\" (a half-page daily section featuring highlights of five or six programs of interest); horoscopes; recaps of the previous week's storylines on network daytime [[soap opera]]s; a page reviewing new [[home video]] (and later, [[DVD]]) releases; dedicated pages that respectively listed select sporting events, children's programs and \"four-star\" movies being broadcast during that week; and crossword puzzles. Although its issues usually focus on different television-related stories week to week, ''TV Guide'' also incorporates recurring issues that appear a few times each year, most notably the \"Fall Preview\" (an issue featured since the magazine's inaugural year in 1953, which features reviews of new series premiering during the fall television season), \"Returning Favorites\" (first published in 1996, featuring previews of series renewed from the previous television season returning for the upcoming fall schedule), \"Winter Preview\" (first published in 1994 and later known as the \"(year) TV Preview\" from 2006 to 2009, featuring previews of [[midseason replacement|midseason]] series) and \"The Best Children's Shows on TV\" (first published in 1989 and later renamed the \"Parents' Guide to Children's Television\" in 1990, and finally as the \"Parent's Guide to Kids' TV\" in 1993, featuring stories and reviews on family-oriented programs).\n\nIcons used for other means than identifying listed stations were first added to the magazine around 1956, using the words \"SPECIAL\" and \"COLOR,\" each set in capital letters inside a rectangular bar, to denote [[television special]]s and programs broadcast in [[color television|color]], respectively. ''TV Guide'' modified all icons incorporated into the local listings section in May 1969, changing the font for the TV-shaped bullets identifying local stations from [[Futura (typeface)|Futura]] to the standard [[Helvetica]] and using similarly TV-shaped bullets marked with the abbreviation \"C\" to denote color programs (replacing the bar/text icons that had been previously used); as color programming became more ubiquitous, in August 1972, the magazine opted to instead identify programs originating in [[black and white]] (marked under the abbreviation \"BW\") within the listings section. In September 1981, listings began to identify programs presented with [[closed captioning|closed or open captions]] or with on-screen [[sign language]] interpretation.\n\nBeing an era when program episodes tended to be faithfully recurring from week to week, TV Guide listings would make note of alterations from the routine or a change in status: \"[Gunsmoke is pre-empted]\"; \"(last episode of the series)\", \"Debut: \", \"Special\". Until the 1970s, double-feature or triple-feature movie presentations by a station would be listed at the starting time of the first feature: \"MOVIE--Double Feature\", then list the movies with numeric bullets in front of each title and synopsis; subsequent to 1970, the magazine listed each movie in its own time entry.\n\nA day's listings continued well past midnight until the last station signed off following prime time programs of the calendar day before, possibly as late as 4:00&nbsp;a.m. The next day's listings could begin as early as 5:00&nbsp;a.m., or earlier.\n\n====Addition of cable listings====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}\nThe advent of cable television would become hard on ''TV Guide''. Cable channels began to be listed in the magazine in 1980 or 1981, depending on the edition; the channels listed also differed with the corresponding edition. Regional and national [[superstation]]s available on cable systems in the designated market of many editions were the only cable channels listed initially as well as, in certain markets, over-the-air subscription services transmitted over local [[Independent station (North America)|independent stations]] (such as [[ONTV (pay TV)|ONTV]]); local subscription television services were often listed as \"STV Programming\" or \"Subscription Television\" for the channel carrying the service, with the service listed separately or, in some editions, not at all. Cable-originated channels \u2013 such as [[HBO]], [[CNN]] (both of which the magazine originally promoted mainly in full-page advertisements), the CBN Cable Network (now [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]]), the [[Alpha Repertory Television Service]] (ARTS, later succeeded by [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] through its 1984 merger with The Entertainment Channel) and [[Nickelodeon]] \u2013 were added gradually between the winter of late 1981 and the first half of 1982, depending on the edition.\n\nTo save page space, ''TV Guide'' incorporated a grid (a rowed display of listings for programs scheduled to air during the evening hours each night, primarily organized by channel) into the listings in September 1981, which was slotted at a random page within each day's afternoon listings. The grid originated as a single-page feature that provided a summary of programs airing during prime time (from 7:00 to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. or 8:00 to 11:00&nbsp;p.m. depending on the start of prime time within a given [[time zone]]) on the stations mentioned in the corresponding edition; by 1985, it was expanded to a two-page section \u2013 which began to take up roughly three-quarters of the two adjoining pages on which it was placed \u2013 that included programs airing during the [[dayparting|early access and late fringe]] periods (from 5:00 to 11:00&nbsp;p.m. or 6:00&nbsp;p.m. to 12:00&nbsp;a.m. local time), with the beginning and end of the magazine-defined prime time daypart (between 7:30 and 11:00&nbsp;p.m. or between 6:30 and 10:00&nbsp;p.m. local time on Monday through Saturdays, and between 7:00 and 11:00&nbsp;p.m. or between 6:00 and 10:00&nbsp;p.m. local time on Sundays) delineated by a thicker border. Channels listed in the grid were organized by broadcast stations, basic cable channels, and premium channels.\n\nIn August 1982, the magazine expanded its coverage of cable programming with the introduction of two feature sections. The first, the \"CablePay Section,\" was a separate color insert that followed the Friday listings, which provided highlights of programs airing on the national basic and premium cable channels (this feature was discontinued in 1985, at which time, cable program highlights were folded into the \"Guidelines\" feature). The second feature, the \"Cable and Pay-TV Movie Guide\" (later renamed the \"Pay-TV Movie Guide\" in 1984 and \"Premium Channels Movie Guide\" in 1997), initially followed the \"CablePay\" insert before being moved to the pages immediately following the Friday listings in May 1985, resulting in the national section \u2013 which had been cordoned into two sections, both preceding and following the local section \u2013 being consolidated into the first half of the pages comprising each issue. The \"Movie Guide,\" which encompassed the final pages of each edition, provided summaries of films scheduled to air over the next one to two weeks on the cable channels included in both the log ''and'' grid listings (excluding those featured exclusively in the grids) as well as a first-page summary of the films scheduled to premiere that week (arranged by channel and sub-categorized by title). As the years went on, more cable channels were added into the listings of each edition. To help offset this, the May 11\u201317, 1985, issue introduced a smaller Helvetica font for the log, along with some other cosmetic changes; in particular, a show's length began to be listed after the show's title instead of at the end of its synopsis. That issue also saw advertising for local stations featured in the corresponding edition be restricted to certain special events, with most program promotions being restricted to those for national broadcast and cable networks.\n\n===News Corporation and Gemstar eras===\nOn August 7, 1988, Triangle Publications was sold to the News America Corporation arm of [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]] for $3 billion,<ref>{{cite news|title=Murdoch to Buy ''TV Guide'' in $3B Deal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8074051.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611061810/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8074051.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 11, 2014|author=Robert Lenzner|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|publisher=Affiliated Publications|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=August 8, 1988|accessdate=February 12, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Murdoch To Purchase 3 Publications; $3 Billion Deal Includes TV Guide|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1272310.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611061819/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1272310.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 11, 2014|author=Jerry Knight|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Graham Media Group|The Washington Post Company]]|via=HighBeam Research|date=August 8, 1988|accessdate=February 12, 2014}}</ref> one of the largest media acquisitions of the time and the most expensive publication transaction at the time.

Starting with that issue, program titles switched from being displayed in all-uppercase to being shown in a mixed case, [[Franklin Gothic]] typeface, film titles \u2013 which had previously been displayed within the film description \u2013 began appearing before a film's synopsis in an italicized format (replacing the generic \"MOVIE\" header that had been used to identify films since the magazine's inception), and children's programs that were compliant with the [[Children's Television Act|Children's Television Act of 1990]] began to be designated by a circular \"[[E/I]]\" icon. In addition, [[infomercial]]s (which had been designated under the boilerplate title \"COMMERCIAL PROGRAM[S]\" until 1994, and \"INFORMERCIAL[S]\" thereafter) ceased being listed in the magazine during time periods in which stations aired them. (Time-brokered programs continued to be listed in the magazine, but were primarily restricted to religious programming.) Replacing the text identifiers that had been included within the film synopses, theatrically released films also began to be identified by a black-and-white boxed \"M\" symbol, accompanied depending on the film by its [[Star (classification)#Films|star rating]] (a formula, on a scale of one [for \"poor\"] to four [for \"excellent\"], based on a consensus of reviews from leading film critics, the quality of the film's cast and director, and the film's box office revenue and award wins). Movie icons also were appropriated to identify direct-to-video (marked as \"M\u2192V\") or made-for-TV (marked as \"M\u2192T\") releases, which were not assigned star ratings. Beginning with the January 25\u201331, 1997, issue, the log listings began incorporating content ratings for programs assigned through the newly implemented [[TV Parental Guidelines]] system (the system's content ratings were subsequently added upon their introduction in October 1998).\n\n[[File:TV Guide magazine cover.png|thumb|right|225px|A ''TV Guide'' cover from the March 17\u201323, 1990, issue.

The sheer amount and diversity of cable television programming made it hard for ''TV Guide'' to provide listings of the extensive array of programming that came directly over the cable system. ''TV Guide'' also could not match the ability of the [[Cable box (electronics)|cable box]] to store personalized listings. Nevertheless, beginning with the September 12\u201318, 1998, issue, the magazine added several new channels to many of its editions, including those that had previously been mentioned only in a foreword on the channel lineup page as well as those that were available mainly on [[digital cable]] and satellite; although most of these newly added channels were placed within the prime time grids, only a few (such as [[Animal Planet]] and [[MSNBC]]) were also incorporated into the log listings.\n\nFeatures in the magazine were also revamped with the additions of \"The Robins Report\" (a review column by writer J. Max Robins), \"Family Page\" (featuring reviews of family-oriented programs) and picks of select classic films airing that week, as well as the removal of the \"Guidelines\" feature in the listings section in favor of the new highlight page \"Don't Miss\" (listing choice programs selected by the magazine's staff for the coming week) in the national color section. Listings for movies within the log also began identifying [[television film|made-for-TV]] and [[direct-to-video]] films, as well as quality ratings on a scale of one to four stars (signifying movies that have received \"poor\" to \"excellent\" reviews).\n\nIn 1999, the magazine began hosting the ''[[TV Guide Award]]s'', an awards show (which was telecast on Fox) honoring television programs and actors, with the winners being chosen by ''TV Guide'' subscribers through a nominee ballot inserted in the magazine; the telecast was discontinued after the 2001 event. The July 17\u201323, 1999, edition saw the evening grids be scaled down to the designated prime time hours, 8:00 to 11:00&nbsp;p.m. (or 7:00 to 10:00&nbsp;p.m.) Monday through Saturdays and 7:00 to 11:00&nbsp;p.m. (or 6:00 to 10:00&nbsp;p.m.) on Sundays, to complement the descriptive log listings for those time periods; this also allowed the grids to be contained to a single page in certain editions that provided listings for more than 20 cable channels.\n\nOn October 5, 1999, [[Gemstar-TV Guide International|Gemstar International Group Ltd.]], the maker of the [[Video recorder scheduling code|VCR Plus+]] device and schedule system (whose channel and program codes for [[Videocassette recorder|VCR]]s using the system for timed recordings were incorporated into the magazine's listings in 1988), and which incidentally was partially owned by News Corporation, purchased United Video Satellite Group; the two companies had previously been involved in a legal battle over the [[intellectual property]] rights for their respective interactive program guide systems, VCR Plus+ and [[Guide Plus|TV Guide On Screen]], that began in 1994.<ref>{{cite news|title=Electronic Rival To Buy TV Guide|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-629280.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611061802/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-629280.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 11, 2014|author=Bob Tourtellotte|newspaper=The Washington Post|publisher=The Washington Post Company|via=HighBeam Research|date=October 5, 1999|accessdate=February 12, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"tourtellotte\">{{cite news|title=Analyst: IPG fight may soon be over|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-55780634.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220160820/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-55780634.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 20, 2016|author=Price Colman|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=Cahners Business Information|via=HighBeam Research|date=September 6, 1999|accessdate=February 12, 2014}}</ref> That month, ''TV Guide'' debuted a 16-page insert into editions in 22 markets with large [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] populations titled ''TV Guide en Espa\u00f1ol'', which provided programming information from national [[Spanish language]] networks (such as [[Univision]] and [[Telemundo]]) as well as special sections with reviews of the week's notable programs. The magazine discontinued the insert in March 2000 due to difficulties resulting from confusion by advertisers over its marketing as \"the first weekly Spanish-language magazine,\" despite its structure as an insert within the main ''TV Guide'' publication.<ref>{{cite news|title=TV Guide Rethinks Spanish-language Insert|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2000-03-29/lifestyle/0003280484_1_tv-guide-latin-tv-latin-america|author=Magaly Morales|newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel|Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|date=March 29, 2000|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}</ref>\n\nTo commemorate the 50th anniversary of ''TV Guide'' as a national magazine, in 2002, the magazine published six special issues:\n* \"TV We'll Always Remember'' (April 6\u201312): Our Favorite Stars Share Fifty Years of Memories, Moments and Magic\"\n* \"[[TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time|50 Greatest Shows of All Time]]'' (May 4\u201310): The Ultimate List of the 50 Best TV Series.

From its inception until 2003, ''TV Guide'' had offered listings for the entire week, 24 hours a day. Numerous changes to the local listings took place beginning with the June 21, 2003 issue \u2013 in just a few select markets, when the 5:00&nbsp;a.m. to 5:00&nbsp;p.m. Monday through Friday listings were condensed down to four grids: these ran from 5:00 to 8:00&nbsp;a.m., 8:00 to 11:00&nbsp;a.m., 11:00&nbsp;a.m. to 2:00&nbsp;p.m., and 2:00 to 5:00&nbsp;p.m. If programming differed from one weekday to the next, the generic descriptor \"Various Programs\" was listed. The weekday grid maintained day-to-day listings for certain cable channels (primarily [[movie channels]] as well as a limited number of basic cable channels such as [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]], [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] and [[USA Network]]), which were organized separately from the other channels. These changes became permanent in all ''TV Guide'' editions beginning with the September 13, 2003, \"Fall Preview\" issue.\n\nOther changes were made to the magazine beginning with the June 21 issue in select markets and the 2003 \"Fall Preview\" issue elsewhere. A half-page daily prime time highlights section featuring the evening's notable shows, movies and sports events \u2013 similar to the former \"Guidelines\" feature \u2013 was re-added to the listings section; a full-page \"Weekday Highlights\" page was also added featuring guest and topical information for the week's [[daytime television|daytime]] [[talk show|talk]] and [[breakfast television|morning shows]] as well as picks for movies airing during the day on broadcast and cable channels. In addition, while log listings continued in use for prime time listings, program synopses were added to the grids and log, as well as a \"''NEW''\" indicator for first-run episodes, replacing the \"(Repeat)\" indicator in the log's synopses. The \"Premium Channels Movie Guide\" was also restructured as \"The Big Movie Guide,\" with film listings being expanded to include those airing on all broadcast networks and cable channels featured in each edition (as well as some that were not listed in a particular local edition), as well as movies that were available on [[pay-per-view]] (page references to the films included in this section were also incorporated into the prime time grids and log listings). Beginning in January 2004, the midnight to 5:00&nbsp;a.m. listings (as well as the Saturday and Sunday 5:00 to 8:00&nbsp;a.m. listings) ceased to include any broadcast stations outside of the edition's home market, leaving only program information for stations within the home market and for cable channels.\n\nThe magazine's format was changed beginning with the April 11, 2004, issue to start the week's listings in each issue on Sunday (the day in which television listings magazines supplemented in [[newspaper]]s traditionally began each week's listings information), rather than Saturday. In July 2004, the overnight listings were removed entirely, replaced by a grid that ran from 11:00&nbsp;p.m. to 2:00&nbsp;a.m. that included only the broadcast stations in each edition's home market and a handful of cable channels. It also listed a small selection of late-night movies airing on certain channels. The time period of the listings in the daytime grids also shifted from starting at 5:00&nbsp;a.m. and ending at 5:00&nbsp;p.m. to running from 7:00&nbsp;a.m. to 7:00&nbsp;p.m. By this point, the log listings were restricted to programs airing from 7:00 to 11:00&nbsp;p.m. In early 2005, more channels were added to the prime time and late-night grids.\n\n====Format overhaul and conversion to national listings====\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| align = left\n| width = 135\n| image1 = TV Guide Logo.png\n| caption1 = Former print logo used from 2003 to 2016; the current logo is based on this design.\n| image2 = \n| caption2 = \n}}\nOn July 26, 2005, Gemstar-TV Guide announced that ''TV Guide'' would abandon its longtime digest size format and begin printing as a larger full-size national magazine that would offer more stories and fewer program listings.<ref>{{cite news|title=TV Guide Remaking Itself With Large Format|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-111476865.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611061808/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-111476865.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 11, 2014|author=Seth Sutel|agency=Associated Press|via=HighBeam Research|date=July 26, 2005|accessdate=February 12, 2014}}</ref> All 140 local editions were eliminated, being replaced by two editions covering the time zones within the [[contiguous United States]]: one for the [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and [[Central Time Zone|Central]] time zones, and one for the [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific]] and [[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain]] time zones (which had existed separately from the local editions prior to the change, although their distribution was primarily limited to [[hotel]]s). The change in format was attributed to the increase in the [[internet]], cable television channels (like TV Guide Network), electronic program guides and [[digital video recorders]] as the sources of choice for viewers' program listings. The new version of ''TV Guide'' went on sale on October 17, 2005, and featured ''[[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]]'' host [[Ty Pennington]] on the cover. The listings format, now consisting entirely of grids, also changed to start the listings in each week's issue on Monday rather than Sunday. As a result of the elimination of the local editions, broadcast stations were replaced by broadcast network schedules with the description \"[[Local programming|Local Programming]]\" being used to denote time periods in which [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]], locally produced or [[infomercial|paid]] programs would air instead of network shows.\n\nIn September 2006, ''TV Guide'' launched a redesigned [[website]], with expanded original editorial and user-generated content not included in the print magazine. On December 22, 2006, ''TV Guide'' introduced the magazine's first ever two-week edition. The edition, which featured [[Rachael Ray]] on the cover, was issued for the period from [[Christmas|December 25]], 2006 to January 7, 2007. In early 2008, the Monday through Friday daytime and daily late night grids were eliminated from the listings section, and the television highlights section was compressed into a six-page review of the week, rather than the previous two pages for each night. By 2007, ''TV Guide''{{'}}s circulation had decreased to less than three million copies from a peak of almost 20 million in 1970.\n\nWith the $2.8 billion acquisition of Gemstar-TV Guide by [[Macrovision]] on May 2, 2008,<ref>{{cite news|title=Macrovision to purchase TV Guide Gemstar fetches $2.8 billion|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-11406880.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611061821/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-11406880.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 11, 2014|author=Michael Liedtke|newspaper=[[Oakland Tribune]]|publisher=[[Bay Area News Group|ANG Newspapers]]|via=HighBeam Research|date=December 8, 2007|accessdate=February 12, 2014}}</ref> that company, which purchased the former mostly to take advantage of their lucrative and profitable VCR Plus and electronic program guide [[patent]]s, stated it wanted to sell both the magazine and TV Guide Network, along with the company's [[horse racing]] channel [[TVG Network]] to other parties.\n\n====TV Guide Talk====\nOn May 18, 2005, ''TV Guide Talk'', a weekly [[podcast]] that was available to download for free, was launched.

They featured the participants discussing and commenting on the past week in television and the entertainment industry in general. The beginning of each podcast was devoted to in-depth discussion on the week's biggest new story in the entertainment industry, whether it be a television program or something outside the scope of television show or movie (such as the [[Academy Awards]] or the [[Emmys]]). The middle part was devoted to discussion and commentary on individual shows.

It also added \"enhanced editorial features,\" including recommendation sections focusing on traditional television and online programming \u2013 such as additional content from senior critic Matt Roush (an expanded \"Roush Review\" column and an additional column featuring ten picks for each week's programs as selected by Roush) and several new sections (\"Upfront,\" featuring trending television-related stories, infographics, question-and-answer coluumns and [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] charts; \"The Guide,\" containing expanded highlights for each day's television programming, including sports, daytime programming and content available for [[streaming media|streaming]] online; a monthly television-related technology column; \"The TV Guide Interview,\" an occasional feature featuring celebrity interviews focusing on their career; and \"On Demand,\" a review column of movies premiering through streaming and [[video on demand|on-demand]] services). In addition, the magazine's size was reduced from 7\u00b3/\u2088\u00d710\u00bc inches to 7\u00d710 inches in a cost-saving measure; it also began to be distributed in airport newsstands.<ref>{{cite news|title=Changes in store for TV Guide|url=https://nypost.com/2014/06/26/changes-in-store-for-tv-guide/|author=Keith J.

TVGM Holdings [[chief executive officer]] David J.

NTVB already owned ''TV Weekly'' and ''Channel Guide'', both of which provide national editorial content and \u2013 through syndication agreements with 160+ newspapers throughout the country, in which they are distributed as supplementary publications incorporated within each paper's Sunday editions \u2013 listings customized for individual regions (the company began distributing its listings magazines in this manner in 2008, as newspapers began to cease publication of their proprietary television listings magazines due to cost-cutting measures spurred by declining circulation and revenue); it also publishes listings publications for pay television providers such as [[Comcast]], [[Time Warner Cable]] and [[Dish Network]]. As such, it is undetermined whether NTVB will reach deals to distribute ''TV Guide'' to newspapers on a separate basis or extend the name to its existing television publications. Staff with ''TV Guide'' and NTVB's other titles will collaborate on feature content included in the respective magazines, while the company will fold advertising sales for the magazine with its existing television magazine titles.<ref>{{cite web|title=TV Guide has been sold, yet again|url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/tv-guide-has-been-sold-yet-again/|author=Bill Cromwell|periodical=Media Life Magazine|date=October 8, 2015|accessdate=November 13, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=TV Guide Magazine Sold to NTVB Media|url=https://www.thewrap.com/tv-guide-magazine-sold-to-ntvb-media/|author=Jordan Chariton|website=The Wrap|publisher=The Wrap Media, LLC|date=October 7, 2015|accessdate=November 13, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=TV Guide Magazine is sold for the third time in less than 10 years to NTVB Media|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-tv-guide-magazine-sale-ntvb-media-20151007-story.html|author=Stephen Battaglio|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=October 7, 2015|accessdate=November 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Editions==\n{{main|List of TV Guide editions}}\nFrom the magazine's inception until the October 2005 conversion to national listings based on time zone, ''TV Guide'' maintained a local-national hybrid format with local editions tailored to a specific region or individual [[media market|market]]. Each regional edition generally served either a single city or a designated region (comprising the largest market[s] served by the edition and one or more smaller, adjacent markets, or a single or multiple neighboring [[U.S. state|states]] or [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]]). [[South Dakota]], [[Delaware]] and the [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]] did not have their own editions during the local listings era. In the case of the two U.S. states, [[Rapid City, South Dakota|Rapid City]] and [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]] (which had their corresponding television stations listed in the Northern Colorado and Nebraska statewide editions, respectively), were presumably both considered too small to have their own editions and were located too far away from one another to be included in one edition; Delaware is split between two markets \u2013 [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle]] and [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent]] counties are part of the Philadelphia market (which comprised two editions, the regional Southeast Pennsylvania edition and a market-specific edition for the Philadelphia area), while [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex County]] is part of the [[Salisbury, Maryland]], market (which had its stations listed in the Washington-Baltimore edition until 1994, and the Baltimore edition thereafter). Some editions that once provided statewide listings were eventually split off into separate editions that only provided listings for a specific region; in addition, certain markets have been added or dropped from some editions.\n\nBy the mid-1990s, nearly 150 editions of the magazine were published; during that decade, ''TV Guide'' began to diversify its editions from those for individual cities and multiple media markets within a given state or multi-state region to include editions for certain cable providers in larger television markets<ref name=\"moss\">{{cite web|title=TV Guide launches Continental editions.

Bullets used for broadcast stations contained a channel number, which had a different layout depending on the identified channel, and were often used in network promotional ads included to identify local affiliates carrying the advertised program. Filled black bullets with a white number overlaid on them designed local broadcast stations located in one of the primary market areas served by a specific edition; white bullets with a black screen outline indicated stations in outlying secondary markets covered by the corresponding edition. Out-of-market stations featured an alphanumeric identifier (with a letter next to the channel number) to disambiguate it from a local station, particularly in feature pages preceding the main listings (such as in the Northern Wisconsin edition, in which \"6M\" was used to disambiguate [[WLUC-TV]] in [[Marquette, Michigan]], from [[WITI (TV)|WITI]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], which only used a \"6\" as its identifier).\n\nThere were some exceptions to this formatting. For example, the [[Hawaii]] edition had the primary [[Honolulu]]-based stations listed first, followed by their satellite sister stations, while the [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], edition had that market's primary stations listed first, followed by the out-of-market outlets; the latter being unique with having the other stations listed below [[WPGH-TV|WPGH]] (channel 53) when it listed a show during non-network hours, and during a network-scheduled lineup \u2013 in this case, NBC \u2013 the primary station and channel being listed first \u2013 [[WPXI]] (11), followed by [[WJAC-TV]]/[[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown]] (6), [[WTOV-TV]]/[[Steubenville, Ohio|Steubenville]] (9), [[WBOY-TV]]/[[Clarksburg, West Virginia]] (12) and [[WFMJ-TV]]/[[Youngstown, Ohio]] (21) \u2013 instead of by order of over-the-air channel number for all stations. If a certain edition featured more than one station that transmitted on the same channel but served different markets, the primary station in the edition was designated by a black bullet with a white number, while the other was indicated by a white bullet with a black number; some editions have also used a split (half for stations broadcasting on frequencies from channel 10 and up; three split with the channel number in the middle) or vertical channel bullet if it covered a large area. At times, several editions with out-of-market channels would have the bullets changed, like the Memphis Edition, where stations outside the primary area (especially the original channels that served the [[WBBJ|Jackson, Tennessee]], [[KAIT-TV|Jonesboro, Arkansas]], and [[WTVA|Tupelo, Mississippi]] markets, which became part of the lineup since that edition's 1960 inception) that was listed in black bullet/white numbers was reconfigured to white bullet/black numbers after more stations were added in 1980.\n\nUpon the incorporation of those channels into the listings section in 1979\u201380, out-of-market superstations were first identified [[alphanumeric]]ally, indicating them by a combination of their over-the-air channel number and a letter representing their originating market city (as examples, [[WKBD-TV]] in [[Detroit]] \u2013 which effectively served as the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate for most of [[Michigan]] until December 1994 via cable \u2013 was listed as \"50D\", and [[KTVT]] in [[Dallas]]\u2013[[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] \u2013 which operated as a regional superstation in areas of [[Texas]] outside of its home market, [[Oklahoma]], [[Arkansas]] and [[Louisiana]] until the station's July 1995 conversion into a CBS affiliate \u2013 was listed as \"11F\"). By 1984, the three major national superstations at the time, [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]], [[WGN America|WGN]] and [[WWOR EMI Service|WOR]] (which were respectively identified as \"17A\", \"9C\" and \"9N\"), were given conventional abbreviated letter designations used by other cable channels. Alphanumeric identifiers were also used in some regional editions to disambiguate broadcast stations with identical channel numbers \u2013 usually for an out-of-market station, with the numeric identifier used for either a local or out-of-market station \u2013 in genre-based listings pages (such as the sports guide), cross-references in the pages preceding the local listings and within the listings section for stations serving as default network affiliates (via cable) in markets without a local major network outlets. (One notable exception was the [[New Mexico]] edition, which from 1984 until 2005, listed [[Los Angeles]] stations [[KTLA]], [[KTTV]] and [[KCOP-TV]], which were available via cable in some parts of the state at certain points during that period, under the codes \"TLA,\" \"COP\" and \"TTV\" instead of \"5L,\" \"11L\" and \"13L\".)\n\nThe outlined bullets that were originally used only for out-of-market television stations were also assigned to cable-originated channels when those began to be incorporated into the listings section in 1981, indicating those services by a three-letter abbreviation in a condensed typeface: for example, \"ESN\" represented ESPN, \"DSC\" represented [[Discovery Channel|The Discovery Channel]] and \"NIK\" represented Nickelodeon/[[Nick at Nite]]. ([[E!]] and [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] later became exceptions, as those channels were identified by two-letter abbreviations.) In certain cases, the abbreviation used (such as \"AMC\" for [[AMC (TV channel)|American Movie Classics]], \"TNT\" for \"[[TNT (U.S. TV network)|Turner Network Television]]\" and \"[[MTV]]\" for \"Music Television\") was that which the channel had already branded by ([[The Nashville Network]] [now [[Paramount Network]]] is a noted exception, as it was initially assigned the abbreviation \"NSH,\" instead of its network-assigned initialism \"TNN\"). Following that group's launch in September 1998, in editions in which one or more smaller markets served by said edition had local affiliates of the primarily cable-only service, affiliates of [[The WB 100+ Station Group]] were also identified in the same manner as conventional cable channels (under the abbreviation \"WB\") for brevity. Some [[PBS]] state or regional member networks were listed similarly in certain editions (such as Mississippi ETV [now [[Mississippi Public Broadcasting]]], which was listed in the Memphis edition under the code \"E\"). Two [[pay television|pay cable]] networks, [[Cinemax]] and [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] eventually [[rebrand]]ed in 1997 so that their respective ''TV Guide'' abbreviations \u2013 \"MAX\" and \"SHO\" \u2013 became the focal point of their logos. Some of the channels that were added to the prime time grids beginning with the September 12\u201318, 1998, issue were identified by four letter abbreviations (such as \"BBCA\" for [[BBC America]] and \"HBOS\" for HBO Signature). In cable-specific editions, a bullet indicating a broadcast or cable channel's local cable assignment (except where a broadcast station's cable channel assignment is the same as its over-the-air channel or where smaller cable systems are listed) appeared alongside the specific station or network indicator.\n\nSome cable channels \u2013 mainly premium channels \u2013 had an [[asterisk]] displayed by them in that edition's channel directory, which meant that it was only listed in the evening grid (and later the \"Pay-TV Movie Guide\"). Cable channels like Cinemax and [[Disney Channel|The Disney Channel]] initially had their programming listed exclusively within the prime time program grids in some editions of the magazine, but were later expanded to have their full daily schedules included in the log listings as well. In some larger markets where the local ''TV Guide'' edition maintained a regionalized format, [[pay-per-view]] services (such as [[Request TV]] and [[In Demand|Viewer's Choice]]) were also included in the prime time grids. By the mid-1990s, most editions of ''TV Guide'' provided program listings for nearly all cable channels featured in each issue within both the grids and the log listings, although some editions continued to list at least one channel, such as [[The Movie Channel]] (the only premium service that was excluded from the log listings in many editions by that point \u2013 though its inclusion in the log, as with select other cable channels, varied by market \u2013 until the September 1998 additions of [[Starz]], [[Starz Encore|Encore]], and HBO [[HBO#Channels|multiplex channels]] HBO Plus (now HBO2) and HBO3 (now HBO Signature) to the listings), exclusively in the grids. (Starz and Encore were listed in select markets where either network was available prior to being expanded to all local and regional editions with the 1998 \"Fall Preview\" issue.)\n\nIf the same program or episode was scheduled to air in the same timeslot on more than one channel, two or more bullets identifying each channel would precede the program title listed in a particular time entry. The usage of multiple bullets to denote stations airing the same program was a more common occurrence in instances where multiple broadcast stations aired the same [[television network|network]] program or their respective local news programs at the same time, although this also applied to broadcast and/or cable channels carrying the same episode of a syndicated program; separate time entries would only be used in this situation if the program had varying running times between channels (the grouping of bullets based on a station's affiliated network was later applied to the prime time grids beginning in September 2003). Another example would involve the synopsis or topic of the program listed; if the same description from the program aired on different channels later on in the day or during that week when it had aired first on another station listed in the edition, readers will notice \u201cSee ch.(xx) at (day/time) for details\u201d below the program.\n\n===Channel directory===\nFor much of the log listings era, the listings section was preceded by a channel directory, which listed the broadcast stations \u2013 and later, cable channels \u2013 whose program information was provided in each edition. The listed channels were organized numerically for broadcast stations and alphabetically (by abbreviation) for cable channels. Until cable-originated channels were added to the magazine, the directory exclusively listed broadcast television stations serving the individual markets serviced by the corresponding edition. Each station was listed in a separate entry corresponding to their [[city of license]], and in some cases, one or more stations serving a particular media market were broken out from competing stations serving the same market based on their primary city of service (for example, in the Oklahoma City/Oklahoma State and North Texas editions, ABC affiliate [[KSWO-TV]] in [[Lawton, Oklahoma]] \u2013 which was designated under a black bullet until the Oklahoma City and Tulsa editions were consolidated into a singular Oklahoma State edition in November 2003, when it began being identified by the outlined bullets assigned to its same-market competitors \u2013 was listed as serving \"Lawton/Wichita Falls,\" appearing in a separate entry from the three stations serving the primary city of that station's home market, [[Wichita Falls, Texas]], NBC affiliate [[KFDX-TV]], CBS affiliate [[KAUZ-TV]] and independent station-turned-Fox affiliate [[KJTL]]).\n\nThe directory originally appeared in the lower one-quarter of the listings section's first page; from the May 11\u201317, 1985, issue onward, it became a full-page insert that directly preceded the listings. Until the May 31\u2013June 6, 1969, issue, the directory also included studio addresses for each of the listed stations. Beginning with the June 7\u201313, 1969, issue, a foreword was included in the directory to denote that all [[public broadcasting|public television stations]] listed in the corresponding edition broadcast [[distance education|instructional programs]] for classroom use during the academic year; most editions did not provide listings for such programs, which were usually broadcast during the weekday morning and afternoon hours.\n\nAdditional forewording was added below the listed channels in the lineup page beginning with the September 10\u201316, 1983, \"Fall Preview\" issue (in select markets; expanded nationwide with the May 11\u201317, 1985, issue) that provided descriptions of channels that were not included in each issue; this foreword was removed beginning with the September 12, 1998, issue, as the magazine began adding many of the channels mentioned in that paragraph. If any broadcast television stations listed in a particular edition operated [[Broadcast relay station#Satellite stations|satellite stations]] to cover adjacent areas not adequately covered by the main signal, a notation listing each repeater \u2013 identified only by channel number \u2013 was included directing readers living in those areas to view programs on those station in correspondence to their originating station (for example, readers of the Northern Wisconsin edition would be guided to the following, \"for programs on [[WJMN-TV|3]] [[Escanaba, Michigan|Escanaba, Mich.]], see [[WFRV-TV|5]]; on 28 [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin|Eau Claire]], 31 [[La Crosse, Wisconsin|La Crosse]] and 55 [[Ellison Bay, Wisconsin|Ellison Bay, Wis.]], see [[Wisconsin Public Television|38]]; on [[WLWK-CD|22]] [[Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin|Sturgeon Bay]], see [[WGBA-TV|26]].\")\n\nFrom the magazine's incorporation of cable-originated channels in its local editions in 1982 until 1984/85, nationally distributed basic cable channels (such as ESPN, Nickelodeon, [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] and CNN) were typically separated from out-of-market stations distributed to area cable providers in the channel lineup page, under the heading \"Satellite Program Services,\" while premium channels (like HBO and Showtime) were categorized as \"Pay-TV Services\"; all cable channels listed in each edition were listed in alphabetical order thereafter, with premium services only being categorized separately from other cable channels in the prime time grids. Notations were also included in some editions, starting with the September 14\u201320, 1985 \"Fall Preview\" issue, to outline programming offered on certain local stations not listed in that edition. In some editions, particularly the \"Ultimate Cable\" and satellite editions, the channel lineup was diagrammed in the form of a conversion chart that listed each channel's assigned placement on cable and satellite providers as well as their VCR Plus+ code number; the lineup pages in some of the local editions switched to these charts beginning in 2003, listing channel slots for major cable providers within the local edition's home market (or in more regionalized editions, the largest markets served by that edition). The channel lineup page was dropped in June 2004 in most local editions.\n\n==Related services==\n===Television and digital services===\n====TV Guide Channel/Network====\n{{main|Pop (U.S. TV channel)}}\nIn June 1998, the ''TV Guide'' brand and magazine were acquired by [[Gemstar-TV Guide International|United Video Satellite Group]],<ref name=\"Gemstar\"/> the parent company of the Prevue Channel \u2013 a channel first launched in 1981 as the Electronic Program Guide network, that was carried by cable and some satellite television providers and was originally formatted to feature a [[electronic program guide|scrolling program guide]], short segments featuring previews of upcoming programs, and [[Promo (media)|promos]] and short-form [[Trailer (promotion)|film trailers]] for programs airing on various channels. Its new owners promptly rebranded Prevue as the '''TV Guide Channel''' on February 1, 1999. With the rebranding, some of the hourly segments featured on the channel at that point were renamed after features in the magazine, including ''TV Guide Close-Up'', ''TV Guide Sportsview'' (which was formatted more similarly to the listings section's sports guide than the color column of that name) and ''TV Guide Insider''. After Gemstar's acquisition of ''TV Guide'', the channel began to shift towards airing full-length programs featuring celebrity gossip and movie-focused talk shows alongside the program listings; the channel was rebranded as the '''TV Guide Network''' in 2007.\n\nFollowing the respective sales of TV Guide's magazine and cable channel by Macrovision to OpenGate Capital and Lionsgate,<ref name=\"OpenGate\"/><ref name=\"LionsgateTVGuide\"/> the magazine and TV Guide Network became operationally separate, although the two properties still collaborated on content for TVGuide.com.

Under Triangle, ''TV Guide'' continued to grow not only in circulation, but in recognition as the authority on television programming with articles \u2013 the majority of which typically appear in the color section \u2013 from both staff and contributing writers.\n\n[[File:Historic TV Guide logos.png|345px|thumb|left|Past logos used by the publication (l\u2013r): 1953\u20131962, 1962\u20131968, 1968\u20131988 and 1988\u20132003.]]\nOver the decades, the shape of the ''TV Guide'' logo has changed to reflect the modernization of the [[television set|television screen]], eventually adopting a [[widescreen]] appearance in September 2003, and then to its current flatscreen appearance in September 2016 (different versions of the logo \u2013 the only cosmetic difference being the utilization of different typefaces \u2013 are currently used respectively for the magazine and the separately owned, CBS-managed digital properties). At first, the logo had various colored backgrounds (usually black, white, blue or green) until the familiar red background became the standard in the 1960s with occasional customizations being utilized for special editions.\n\n[[File:TV Guide first issue.png|225px|thumb|right|The first issue of ''TV Guide'' (April 3, 1953), featuring [[Desi Arnaz Jr.]], the youngest of [[Lucille Ball]] (seen at upper right inset) and [[Desi Arnaz]]'s two children; Ball's pregnancy with Arnaz Jr. was incorporated into her ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' character's storyline, with his January 1953 birth coinciding with that of the fictional \"Little Ricky\" Ricardo.]]\nThe magazine was first based in a small office in downtown Philadelphia, before moving to more spacious national headquarters in [[Radnor Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Radnor]], [[Pennsylvania]], in the late 1950s. The new facility, complete with a large lighted ''TV Guide'' logo at the building's entrance, based its management, editors, production personnel and subscription processors as well as a vast computer system holding data on every television show and movie available for listing in the popular weekly publication. Printing of the national color section of ''TV Guide'' \u2013 which incorporates television-related stories, and select feature columns such as program reviews \u2013 took place at Triangle's Gravure Division plant \u2013 which was known for performing some of the highest quality printing in the industry, with almost always perfect registration \u2013 located adjacent to the company's landmark [[Inquirer Building]] on North [[Broad Street (Philadelphia)|Broad Street]] in Philadelphia. The color section was then sent to regional printers to be wrapped around the local listing sections.\n\nIn addition to ''TV Guide'' and its flagship newspaper ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', Triangle Publications also owned the ''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]''; ten radio and six television stations ([[WFIL|WFIL AM]]-[[WBEB|FM]]-[[WPVI-TV|TV]] in Philadelphia, WNHC [[WYBC (AM)|AM]]-[[WPLR|FM]]-[[WTNH|TV]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], KFRE [[KWRU|AM]]-[[KSKS|FM]]-[[KFSN-TV|TV]] in [[Fresno, California]], [[WNBF|WNBF AM]]-[[WHWK|FM]]-[[WBNG|TV]] in [[Binghamton, New York]], [[WFBG|WFBG AM]]-[[WFGY|FM]]-[[WTAJ-TV|TV]] in [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]] and [[WXBU|WLYH-TV]] in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]]\u2013[[Lebanon, Pennsylvania]]);, ''[[The Atlantic]]'',''[[Star & Sky]]'', ''[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]'', ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', [[Elementary Electronics]]'', ''[[Playboy]]'', ''[[A+ (magazine)|A+]]'' the Apple Computer Magazine from the 1980s'', ''[[The Daily Racing Form]]''; ''The Morning Telegraph''; ''[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]''; and various [[cable television]] interests. (It was under Triangle's ownership of WFIL-TV that ''[[American Bandstand]]'' came to popularity, which, in turn, led to host [[Dick Clark]] ascending to become a major television personality.) Triangle Publications sold its Philadelphia newspapers to [[Knight Ridder|Knight Newspapers]] in 1969, its radio and television stations during the early 1970s to [[Capital Cities/ABC Inc.|Capital Cities Communications]] (the television stations that are now known as KFSN-TV and WPVI-TV were subsequently acquired by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] through its 1986 merger with Capital Cities) and various other interests, retaining only ''TV Guide'', ''Seventeen'' and ''The Daily Racing Form''.\n\nFor the magazine's first 52 years of publication, listings information was displayed in a \"log\" format, a mainly text-based list of programs organized by both start time and channel, which was the sole method \u2013 eventually, primary once [[prime time]] [[Grid (graphic design)|grids]] were incorporated, and later secondary for the final two years of its inclusion of local listings \u2013 of displaying program information in ''TV Guide'' until the switch to national listings in 2005; this allowed for the display of full titles for each program as well as the inclusion of synopses for movies and most programs. Most listing entries in the log included program genres (and for national news programs, [[news presenter|anchors]]) after the program's title, while its running time (which was mentioned only if a program lasted a minimum of one hour \u2013 later 35 minutes \u2013 in length) was listed (in hours and minutes) in the synopses.\n\nChannel numbers were set in a tiny round icon (known as a \"bullet\") at the beginning of the listing; this bullet was soon modified to be the shape of a TV screen, similar to the shape of the ''TV Guide'' logo. In most editions, stations serving a particular edition's immediate local coverage area were denoted with a white numeral for its channel number set inside a black TV-shaped bullet; stations serving neighboring communities outside the immediate area, but which could also be viewed in the primary local area, were denoted with a black numeral inside a white TV-shaped bullet outlined in black (for example, in the [[San Francisco Bay Area|San Francisco]] edition, stations based in San Francisco or Oakland had their channel numbers listed as white-on-black TV-shaped bullets, while stations serving neighboring [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] or [[Salinas, California|Salinas]]/[[Monterey, California|Monterey]] (but could still be viewed in parts of San Francisco or Oakland, including their suburbs, as fringe reception) had their channel numbers listed as black-on-white icons). A particular listing could begin with as many as three or more channel bullets depending upon the number of stations in the immediate and surrounding areas broadcasting the same program at that particular time (usually different affiliates of the same network, based in the primary city as well as in neighboring areas). See the subsection \"[[TV Guide#Listings section|Listings section]],\" in the \"Editions\" section below, for a detailed explanation.\n\nOriginally, the majority of programs listed in the log each issue featured brief synopses, except for local and national newscasts, and programs airing on certain stations in various timeslots. As other [[terrestrial television|broadcast]] [[television station]]s and [[cable channel]]s were added, due to set space requirements for the local listings section, detailed synopses were gradually restricted to series and [[television special|specials]] \u2013 usually those airing in evening \"[[prime time]]\" timeslots \u2013 as well as movies airing on broadcast television, while shorter synopses were used for programs seen on broadcast stations outside of the edition's home market and select cable channels; and only the title along with basic supplementary information (such as genre and/or program length) for most other broadcast and cable programs. In addition, black-and-white ads for programs scheduled to air on broadcast stations \u2013 and later, cable channels \u2013 during prime time (with local airtimes, and for broadcast stations, information for [[network affiliate|network-affiliated stations]] featured in the edition which were scheduled to air the advertised show) were included within the listings. Ads for major network programs were generally produced by the networks themselves (and often, the networks would run a full-page or even a [[Double truck|double-truck]] ad for an entire night of programming, or for a major movie or special, or for the season premiere of a [[Saturday-morning cartoon|Saturday morning cartoon]] lineup); ads for locally produced programs, including local newscasts, were produced by individual stations (network affiliates as well as independent stations). Such locally provided ads almost always used the distinctive logos used by particular stations (for example, the \"Circle 7\" logo used for many years primarily by stations either owned by, or affiliated with, ABC). (Black-and-white ads for general products, services and special offers, similar to those seen in other national magazines, were also placed in the listings section.)\n\nA regular feature of the listings section was \"Close-Up,\" usually a half-page segment, which provided expanded reviews of select programs airing each day (various editions of \"Close-Up\" were eventually used for different types of programs, from premieres of new series to shows airing on cable). Over time, other regular and recurring features (most of them television-related) were included alongside the listings including \"Insider\" (a television news and interview section in the lead pages of the color section); \"Cheers and Jeers\" (a critique page about various aspects of television programming); \"Hits and Misses\" (featuring brief reviews of select programs in the coming week, rated on a score from 0 to 10); \"Guidelines\" (a half-page daily section featuring highlights of five or six programs of interest); horoscopes; recaps of the previous week's storylines on network daytime [[soap opera]]s; a page reviewing new [[home video]] (and later, [[DVD]]) releases; dedicated pages that respectively listed select sporting events, children's programs and \"four-star\" movies being broadcast during that week; and crossword puzzles. Although its issues usually focus on different television-related stories week to week, ''TV Guide'' also incorporates recurring issues that appear a few times each year, most notably the \"Fall Preview\" (an issue featured since the magazine's inaugural year in 1953, which features reviews of new series premiering during the fall television season), \"Returning Favorites\" (first published in 1996, featuring previews of series renewed from the previous television season returning for the upcoming fall schedule), \"Winter Preview\" (first published in 1994 and later known as the \"(year) TV Preview\" from 2006 to 2009, featuring previews of [[midseason replacement|midseason]] series) and \"The Best Children's Shows on TV\" (first published in 1989 and later renamed the \"Parents' Guide to Children's Television\" in 1990, and finally as the \"Parent's Guide to Kids' TV\" in 1993, featuring stories and reviews on family-oriented programs).\n\nIcons used for other means than identifying listed stations were first added to the magazine around 1956, using the words \"SPECIAL\" and \"COLOR,\" each set in capital letters inside a rectangular bar, to denote [[television special]]s and programs broadcast in [[color television|color]], respectively. ''TV Guide'' modified all icons incorporated into the local listings section in May 1969, changing the font for the TV-shaped bullets identifying local stations from [[Futura (typeface)|Futura]] to the standard [[Helvetica]] and using similarly TV-shaped bullets marked with the abbreviation \"C\" to denote color programs (replacing the bar/text icons that had been previously used); as color programming became more ubiquitous, in August 1972, the magazine opted to instead identify programs originating in [[black and white]] (marked under the abbreviation \"BW\") within the listings section. In September 1981, listings began to identify programs presented with [[closed captioning|closed or open captions]] or with on-screen [[sign language]] interpretation.\n\nBeing an era when program episodes tended to be faithfully recurring from week to week, TV Guide listings would make note of alterations from the routine or a change in status: \"[Gunsmoke is pre-empted]\"; \"(last episode of the series)\", \"Debut: \", \"Special\". Until the 1970s, double-feature or triple-feature movie presentations by a station would be listed at the starting time of the first feature: \"MOVIE--Double Feature\", then list the movies with numeric bullets in front of each title and synopsis; subsequent to 1970, the magazine listed each movie in its own time entry.\n\nA day's listings continued well past midnight until the last station signed off following prime time programs of the calendar day before, possibly as late as 4:00&nbsp;a.m. The next day's listings could begin as early as 5:00&nbsp;a.m., or earlier.\n\n====Addition of cable listings====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}\nThe advent of cable television would become hard on ''TV Guide''. Cable channels began to be listed in the magazine in 1980 or 1981, depending on the edition; the channels listed also differed with the corresponding edition. Regional and national [[superstation]]s available on cable systems in the designated market of many editions were the only cable channels listed initially as well as, in certain markets, over-the-air subscription services transmitted over local [[Independent station (North America)|independent stations]] (such as [[ONTV (pay TV)|ONTV]]); local subscription television services were often listed as \"STV Programming\" or \"Subscription Television\" for the channel carrying the service, with the service listed separately or, in some editions, not at all. Cable-originated channels \u2013 such as [[HBO]], [[CNN]] (both of which the magazine originally promoted mainly in full-page advertisements), the CBN Cable Network (now [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]]), the [[Alpha Repertory Television Service]] (ARTS, later succeeded by [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] through its 1984 merger with The Entertainment Channel) and [[Nickelodeon]] \u2013 were added gradually between the winter of late 1981 and the first half of 1982, depending on the edition.\n\nTo save page space, ''TV Guide'' incorporated a grid (a rowed display of listings for programs scheduled to air during the evening hours each night, primarily organized by channel) into the listings in September 1981, which was slotted at a random page within each day's afternoon listings. The grid originated as a single-page feature that provided a summary of programs airing during prime time (from 7:00 to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. or 8:00 to 11:00&nbsp;p.m. depending on the start of prime time within a given [[time zone]]) on the stations mentioned in the corresponding edition; by 1985, it was expanded to a two-page section \u2013 which began to take up roughly three-quarters of the two adjoining pages on which it was placed \u2013 that included programs airing during the [[dayparting|early access and late fringe]] periods (from 5:00 to 11:00&nbsp;p.m. or 6:00&nbsp;p.m. to 12:00&nbsp;a.m. local time), with the beginning and end of the magazine-defined prime time daypart (between 7:30 and 11:00&nbsp;p.m. or between 6:30 and 10:00&nbsp;p.m. local time on Monday through Saturdays, and between 7:00 and 11:00&nbsp;p.m. or between 6:00 and 10:00&nbsp;p.m. local time on Sundays) delineated by a thicker border. Channels listed in the grid were organized by broadcast stations, basic cable channels, and premium channels.\n\nIn August 1982, the magazine expanded its coverage of cable programming with the introduction of two feature sections. The first, the \"CablePay Section,\" was a separate color insert that followed the Friday listings, which provided highlights of programs airing on the national basic and premium cable channels (this feature was discontinued in 1985, at which time, cable program highlights were folded into the \"Guidelines\" feature). The second feature, the \"Cable and Pay-TV Movie Guide\" (later renamed the \"Pay-TV Movie Guide\" in 1984 and \"Premium Channels Movie Guide\" in 1997), initially followed the \"CablePay\" insert before being moved to the pages immediately following the Friday listings in May 1985, resulting in the national section \u2013 which had been cordoned into two sections, both preceding and following the local section \u2013 being consolidated into the first half of the pages comprising each issue. The \"Movie Guide,\" which encompassed the final pages of each edition, provided summaries of films scheduled to air over the next one to two weeks on the cable channels included in both the log ''and'' grid listings (excluding those featured exclusively in the grids) as well as a first-page summary of the films scheduled to premiere that week (arranged by channel and sub-categorized by title). As the years went on, more cable channels were added into the listings of each edition. To help offset this, the May 11\u201317, 1985, issue introduced a smaller Helvetica font for the log, along with some other cosmetic changes; in particular, a show's length began to be listed after the show's title instead of at the end of its synopsis. That issue also saw advertising for local stations featured in the corresponding edition be restricted to certain special events, with most program promotions being restricted to those for national broadcast and cable networks.\n\n===News Corporation and Gemstar eras===\nOn August 7, 1988, Triangle Publications was sold to the News America Corporation arm of [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]] for $3 billion,<ref>{{cite news|title=Murdoch to Buy ''TV Guide'' in $3B Deal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8074051.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611061810/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8074051.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 11, 2014|author=Robert Lenzner|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|publisher=Affiliated Publications|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=August 8, 1988|accessdate=February 12, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Murdoch To Purchase 3 Publications; $3 Billion Deal Includes TV Guide|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1272310.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611061819/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1272310.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 11, 2014|author=Jerry Knight|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Graham Media Group|The Washington Post Company]]|via=HighBeam Research|date=August 8, 1988|accessdate=February 12, 2014}}</ref> one of the largest media acquisitions of the time and the most expensive publication transaction at the time.

(Two-digit PlusCodes corresponding to the channel airing the program that a user wished to record were listed after each channel in the channel directory page; one- to eight-digit codes for individual programs were listed in the log listings section following the title of each program.)

Starting with that issue, program titles switched from being displayed in all-uppercase to being shown in a mixed case, [[Franklin Gothic]] typeface, film titles \u2013 which had previously been displayed within the film description \u2013 began appearing before a film's synopsis in an italicized format (replacing the generic \"MOVIE\" header that had been used to identify films since the magazine's inception), and children's programs that were compliant with the [[Children's Television Act|Children's Television Act of 1990]] began to be designated by a circular \"[[E/I]]\" icon. In addition, [[infomercial]]s (which had been designated under the boilerplate title \"COMMERCIAL PROGRAM[S]\" until 1994, and \"INFORMERCIAL[S]\" thereafter) ceased being listed in the magazine during time periods in which stations aired them. (Time-brokered programs continued to be listed in the magazine, but were primarily restricted to religious programming.) Replacing the text identifiers that had been included within the film synopses, theatrically released films also began to be identified by a black-and-white boxed \"M\" symbol, accompanied depending on the film by its [[Star (classification)#Films|star rating]] (a formula, on a scale of one [for \"poor\"] to four [for \"excellent\"], based on a consensus of reviews from leading film critics, the quality of the film's cast and director, and the film's box office revenue and award wins). Movie icons also were appropriated to identify direct-to-video (marked as \"M\u2192V\") or made-for-TV (marked as \"M\u2192T\") releases, which were not assigned star ratings. Beginning with the January 25\u201331, 1997, issue, the log listings began incorporating content ratings for programs assigned through the newly implemented [[TV Parental Guidelines]] system (the system's content ratings were subsequently added upon their introduction in October 1998).\n\n[[File:TV Guide magazine cover.png|thumb|right|225px|A ''TV Guide'' cover from the March 17\u201323, 1990, issue.

The sheer amount and diversity of cable television programming made it hard for ''TV Guide'' to provide listings of the extensive array of programming that came directly over the cable system. ''TV Guide'' also could not match the ability of the [[Cable box (electronics)|cable box]] to store personalized listings. Nevertheless, beginning with the September 12\u201318, 1998, issue, the magazine added several new channels to many of its editions, including those that had previously been mentioned only in a foreword on the channel lineup page as well as those that were available mainly on [[digital cable]] and satellite; although most of these newly added channels were placed within the prime time grids, only a few (such as [[Animal Planet]] and [[MSNBC]]) were also incorporated into the log listings.\n\nFeatures in the magazine were also revamped with the additions of \"The Robins Report\" (a review column by writer J. Max Robins), \"Family Page\" (featuring reviews of family-oriented programs) and picks of select classic films airing that week, as well as the removal of the \"Guidelines\" feature in the listings section in favor of the new highlight page \"Don't Miss\" (listing choice programs selected by the magazine's staff for the coming week) in the national color section. Listings for movies within the log also began identifying [[television film|made-for-TV]] and [[direct-to-video]] films, as well as quality ratings on a scale of one to four stars (signifying movies that have received \"poor\" to \"excellent\" reviews).\n\nIn 1999, the magazine began hosting the ''[[TV Guide Award]]s'', an awards show (which was telecast on Fox) honoring television programs and actors, with the winners being chosen by ''TV Guide'' subscribers through a nominee ballot inserted in the magazine; the telecast was discontinued after the 2001 event. The July 17\u201323, 1999, edition saw the evening grids be scaled down to the designated prime time hours, 8:00 to 11:00&nbsp;p.m. (or 7:00 to 10:00&nbsp;p.m.) Monday through Saturdays and 7:00 to 11:00&nbsp;p.m. (or 6:00 to 10:00&nbsp;p.m.) on Sundays, to complement the descriptive log listings for those time periods; this also allowed the grids to be contained to a single page in certain editions that provided listings for more than 20 cable channels.\n\nOn October 5, 1999, [[Gemstar-TV Guide International|Gemstar International Group Ltd.]], the maker of the [[Video recorder scheduling code|VCR Plus+]] device and schedule system (whose channel and program codes for [[Videocassette recorder|VCR]]s using the system for timed recordings were incorporated into the magazine's listings in 1988), and which incidentally was partially owned by News Corporation, purchased United Video Satellite Group; the two companies had previously been involved in a legal battle over the [[intellectual property]] rights for their respective interactive program guide systems, VCR Plus+ and [[Guide Plus|TV Guide On Screen]], that began in 1994.<ref>{{cite news|title=Electronic Rival To Buy TV Guide|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-629280.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611061802/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-629280.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 11, 2014|author=Bob Tourtellotte|newspaper=The Washington Post|publisher=The Washington Post Company|via=HighBeam Research|date=October 5, 1999|accessdate=February 12, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"tourtellotte\">{{cite news|title=Analyst: IPG fight may soon be over|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-55780634.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220160820/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-55780634.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 20, 2016|author=Price Colman|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=Cahners Business Information|via=HighBeam Research|date=September 6, 1999|accessdate=February 12, 2014}}</ref> That month, ''TV Guide'' debuted a 16-page insert into editions in 22 markets with large [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] populations titled ''TV Guide en Espa\u00f1ol'', which provided programming information from national [[Spanish language]] networks (such as [[Univision]] and [[Telemundo]]) as well as special sections with reviews of the week's notable programs. The magazine discontinued the insert in March 2000 due to difficulties resulting from confusion by advertisers over its marketing as \"the first weekly Spanish-language magazine,\" despite its structure as an insert within the main ''TV Guide'' publication.<ref>{{cite news|title=TV Guide Rethinks Spanish-language Insert|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2000-03-29/lifestyle/0003280484_1_tv-guide-latin-tv-latin-america|author=Magaly Morales|newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel|Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|date=March 29, 2000|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}</ref>\n\nTo commemorate the 50th anniversary of ''TV Guide'' as a national magazine, in 2002, the magazine published six special issues:\n* \"TV We'll Always Remember'' (April 6\u201312): Our Favorite Stars Share Fifty Years of Memories, Moments and Magic\"\n* \"[[TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time|50 Greatest Shows of All Time]]'' (May 4\u201310): The Ultimate List of the 50 Best TV Series.

Could We Be Having Any More Fun?\"\n\nBy 2003, the number of cable channels that were only listed in the grids expanded, with the addition of channels such as BBC America, [[Soapnet]] and the [[National Geographic Channel]] (some editions also featured a limited amount of broadcast stations \u2013 either in-market, out-of-market or both \u2013 exclusively in the grids); conversely, sister cable network [[Pop (U.S. TV channel)|TV Guide Channel]] (whose listings were added to the magazine after the Gemstar purchase) was relegated from the log listings to the grids in most editions. From its inception until 2003, ''TV Guide'' had offered listings for the entire week, 24 hours a day. Numerous changes to the local listings took place beginning with the June 21, 2003 issue \u2013 in just a few select markets, when the 5:00&nbsp;a.m. to 5:00&nbsp;p.m. Monday through Friday listings were condensed down to four grids: these ran from 5:00 to 8:00&nbsp;a.m., 8:00 to 11:00&nbsp;a.m., 11:00&nbsp;a.m. to 2:00&nbsp;p.m., and 2:00 to 5:00&nbsp;p.m. If programming differed from one weekday to the next, the generic descriptor \"Various Programs\" was listed. The weekday grid maintained day-to-day listings for certain cable channels (primarily [[movie channels]] as well as a limited number of basic cable channels such as [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]], [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] and [[USA Network]]), which were organized separately from the other channels. These changes became permanent in all ''TV Guide'' editions beginning with the September 13, 2003, \"Fall Preview\" issue.\n\nOther changes were made to the magazine beginning with the June 21 issue in select markets and the 2003 \"Fall Preview\" issue elsewhere. A half-page daily prime time highlights section featuring the evening's notable shows, movies and sports events \u2013 similar to the former \"Guidelines\" feature \u2013 was re-added to the listings section; a full-page \"Weekday Highlights\" page was also added featuring guest and topical information for the week's [[daytime television|daytime]] [[talk show|talk]] and [[breakfast television|morning shows]] as well as picks for movies airing during the day on broadcast and cable channels. In addition, while log listings continued in use for prime time listings, program synopses were added to the grids and log, as well as a \"''NEW''\" indicator for first-run episodes, replacing the \"(Repeat)\" indicator in the log's synopses. The \"Premium Channels Movie Guide\" was also restructured as \"The Big Movie Guide,\" with film listings being expanded to include those airing on all broadcast networks and cable channels featured in each edition (as well as some that were not listed in a particular local edition), as well as movies that were available on [[pay-per-view]] (page references to the films included in this section were also incorporated into the prime time grids and log listings). Beginning in January 2004, the midnight to 5:00&nbsp;a.m. listings (as well as the Saturday and Sunday 5:00 to 8:00&nbsp;a.m. listings) ceased to include any broadcast stations outside of the edition's home market, leaving only program information for stations within the home market and for cable channels.\n\nThe magazine's format was changed beginning with the April 11, 2004, issue to start the week's listings in each issue on Sunday (the day in which television listings magazines supplemented in [[newspaper]]s traditionally began each week's listings information), rather than Saturday. In July 2004, the overnight listings were removed entirely, replaced by a grid that ran from 11:00&nbsp;p.m. to 2:00&nbsp;a.m. that included only the broadcast stations in each edition's home market and a handful of cable channels. It also listed a small selection of late-night movies airing on certain channels. The time period of the listings in the daytime grids also shifted from starting at 5:00&nbsp;a.m. and ending at 5:00&nbsp;p.m. to running from 7:00&nbsp;a.m. to 7:00&nbsp;p.m. By this point, the log listings were restricted to programs airing from 7:00 to 11:00&nbsp;p.m. In early 2005, more channels were added to the prime time and late-night grids.\n\n====Format overhaul and conversion to national listings====\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| align = left\n| width = 135\n| image1 = TV Guide Logo.png\n| caption1 = Former print logo used from 2003 to 2016; the current logo is based on this design.\n| image2 = \n| caption2 = \n}}\nOn July 26, 2005, Gemstar-TV Guide announced that ''TV Guide'' would abandon its longtime digest size format and begin printing as a larger full-size national magazine that would offer more stories and fewer program listings.<ref>{{cite news|title=TV Guide Remaking Itself With Large Format|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-111476865.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611061808/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-111476865.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 11, 2014|author=Seth Sutel|agency=Associated Press|via=HighBeam Research|date=July 26, 2005|accessdate=February 12, 2014}}</ref> All 140 local editions were eliminated, being replaced by two editions covering the time zones within the [[contiguous United States]]: one for the [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and [[Central Time Zone|Central]] time zones, and one for the [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific]] and [[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain]] time zones (which had existed separately from the local editions prior to the change, although their distribution was primarily limited to [[hotel]]s). The change in format was attributed to the increase in the [[internet]], cable television channels (like TV Guide Network), electronic program guides and [[digital video recorders]] as the sources of choice for viewers' program listings. The new version of ''TV Guide'' went on sale on October 17, 2005, and featured ''[[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]]'' host [[Ty Pennington]] on the cover. The listings format, now consisting entirely of grids, also changed to start the listings in each week's issue on Monday rather than Sunday. As a result of the elimination of the local editions, broadcast stations were replaced by broadcast network schedules with the description \"[[Local programming|Local Programming]]\" being used to denote time periods in which [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]], locally produced or [[infomercial|paid]] programs would air instead of network shows.\n\nIn September 2006, ''TV Guide'' launched a redesigned [[website]], with expanded original editorial and user-generated content not included in the print magazine. On December 22, 2006, ''TV Guide'' introduced the magazine's first ever two-week edition. The edition, which featured [[Rachael Ray]] on the cover, was issued for the period from [[Christmas|December 25]], 2006 to January 7, 2007. In early 2008, the Monday through Friday daytime and daily late night grids were eliminated from the listings section, and the television highlights section was compressed into a six-page review of the week, rather than the previous two pages for each night. By 2007, ''TV Guide''{{'}}s circulation had decreased to less than three million copies from a peak of almost 20 million in 1970.\n\nWith the $2.8 billion acquisition of Gemstar-TV Guide by [[Macrovision]] on May 2, 2008,<ref>{{cite news|title=Macrovision to purchase TV Guide Gemstar fetches $2.8 billion|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-11406880.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611061821/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-11406880.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 11, 2014|author=Michael Liedtke|newspaper=[[Oakland Tribune]]|publisher=[[Bay Area News Group|ANG Newspapers]]|via=HighBeam Research|date=December 8, 2007|accessdate=February 12, 2014}}</ref> that company, which purchased the former mostly to take advantage of their lucrative and profitable VCR Plus and electronic program guide [[patent]]s, stated it wanted to sell both the magazine and TV Guide Network, along with the company's [[horse racing]] channel [[TVG Network]] to other parties.\n\n====TV Guide Talk====\nOn May 18, 2005, ''TV Guide Talk'', a weekly [[podcast]] that was available to download for free, was launched. The podcast was headlined by ''TV Guide'' reporter/personality [[Michael Ausiello]], and was co-hosted by his colleagues at the magazine, Matt Webb Mitovich,<ref>[http://community.tvguide.com/blog-entry/TVGuide-News-Blog/Todays-News/Matt-Webb-Mitovich/800018104] {{Dead link |date=December 2016}}</ref> Angel Cohn, Daniel Manu and [[Maitland McDonagh]]. Each episode featured commentary from TV Guide staff on the week's entertainment news stories, television programs, and film releases, as well as occasional interviews with actors, producers, and executives. On April 4, 2008 (following Ausiello's move to ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''), it was announced that the podcast would be ending,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080407215150/http://community.tvguide.com/blog-entry/TVGuide-Editors-Blog/Tv-Mattrs/Tv-Guide-Talk/800036873 The TV Guide Talk Podcast Is Signing Off - TV Matt'rs | TVGuide.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and the final episode (Episode No. 139) was released on April 10, 2008.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080414173548/http://community.tvguide.com/blog-entry/TVGuide-Editors-Blog/Tv-Mattrs/Tv-Guide-Talk/800037209 TV Guide Talk Episode No. 139 Is Now Live! - TV Matt'rs | TVGuide.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nTV Guide Talk podcasts were released every Friday afternoon and averaged an hour in length. They featured the participants discussing and commenting on the past week in television and the entertainment industry in general. The beginning of each podcast was devoted to in-depth discussion on the week's biggest new story in the entertainment industry, whether it be a television program or something outside the scope of television show or movie (such as the [[Academy Awards]] or the [[Emmys]]). The middle part was devoted to discussion and commentary on individual shows. The podcast emphasized programs that tend to have a large online following even if that following is not necessarily reflected in the programs' Nielsen rating.  Examples include ''[[American Idol]]'', ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'', ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', ''[[Survivor (US TV series)|Survivor]]'', ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'', ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', and ''[[Project Runway]]'' (the latter three being examples a low-rated shows which nevertheless have sizable online followings). Each podcast also ended with a weekly review of that weekend's new theatrical releases.\n\n===OpenGate Capital era===\nOn October 13, 2008, Macrovision sold the money-losing magazine (which was reportedly posting revenue losses of $20 million per year by that point) to [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]]-based equity fund [[OpenGate Capital]] for $1, and a $9.5 million loan at 3% interest.<ref name=\"OpenGate\">{{cite web|title=TV Guide Sold for a Buck|url=http://adage.com/mediaworks/article?article_id=131756|author=Nat Ives|website=[[Advertising Age]]|publisher=[[Crain Communications]]|date=October 15, 2008|accessdate=July 17, 2010}}</ref> As part of the sale, however, Macrovision retained ownership of the companion website<ref>{{cite web|title=TV Guide, Once Master of the Airwaves, Tries to Survive in a Competitive Category|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/08/business/media/08guide.html?_r=1&ref=television|author=Stephanie Clifford|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=December 8, 2008|accessdate=March 28, 2014}}</ref> \u2013 which was then sold to equity firm [[One Equity Partners]] for $300 million \u2013<ref>{{cite news|title=Macrovision Is Selling TV Guide Network Listings|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/19/business/media/19guide.html|author=[[Brian Stelter]]|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=December 18, 2008|accessdate=November 13, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Macrovision, Allen Shapiro and One Equity Partners Announce Agreement for Sale of TV Guide Network|url=http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20081218005522&newsLang=en|publisher=Macrovision|via=[[BusinessWire]]|date=December 12, 2008|accessdate=July 17, 2010}}</ref> which severed all editorial connections between the magazine and website, including the end of critic Matt Roush's presence on TVGuide.com.<ref>{{cite web|title=Where in the World Is Matt (Roush)?|url=https://www.tvguide.com/Roush/Where-Matt-Roush-1000790.aspx|website=TV Guide|publisher=One Equity Partners|date=December 12, 2008|accessdate=April 27, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203105814/http://www.tvguide.com/roush/where-matt-roush-1000790.aspx|archivedate=December 3, 2010}}</ref> The editorial content of the magazine was launched on a new site, TVGuideMagazine.com, which did not feature ''TV Guide''{{'}}s listings in any form.

It is likely that TV Guide Network's removal from ''TV Guide''{{'}}s listings was related to the \"divorce\" of the website and network from the magazine. In early February 2009, The CW and MTV were brought back to the listings after the magazine received numerous emails protesting the move; as a consequence, listings for several low-rated networks were removed.<ref>{{cite web|title=TV Guide relists CW, MTV shows|url=https://variety.com/2009/biz/markets-festivals/tv-guide-relists-cw-mtv-shows-1117999586/|author=Michael Schenider|periodical=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=February 4, 2009|accessdate=April 27, 2010}}</ref> The other channels previously incorporated into the listings before their removal were slowly re-added, until TV Guide Network's schedule returned to the listings pages in June 2010 with its logo prominent within the grids as part of the deal with Lionsgate's TV Guide division. Under OpenGate ownership, ''TV Guide'' slowly returned to profitability mainly through cost reductions instituted by its venture capital parent, making significant staffing reductions and switching to bi-weekly editions full-time, reducing the number of issues it published to 29 per year.\n\nIn March 2013, [[CBS Corporation]] acquired One Equity Partners' stake of their TV Guide assets.<ref name=\"deadline-cbspoisedtvguide\">{{cite web|title=CBS Poised To Buy Half Of TV Guide, Partner With Lionsgate|url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/03/cbs-acquiring-tv-guide-partner-with-lionsgate/|author=Nellie Andreeva|website=Deadline Hollywood|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=March 22, 2013|accessdate=March 28, 2014}}</ref> The CBS acquisition was finalized later that month for $100 million.<ref name=\"deadline-cbstvguide\"/> On May 31, 2013, CBS bought Lionsgate's share of TV Guide Digital, which includes the website and [[mobile app]]s.<ref name=\"deadline-cbstvguide\"/> On January 31, 2014, OpenGate Capital and [[CBS Interactive]] announced a deal to cross-promote ''TV Guide Magazine'' with TVGuide.com and CBS Interactive's other internet properties (including [[TV.com]], [[Metacritic]] and [[CNET]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Through Two Owners, TV Guide Print and Digital Content Comes Together|url=http://www.minonline.com/news/Through-Two-Owners-TV-Guide-Print-and-Digital-Content-Comes-Together_23673.html|author=Arti Patel|website=MIN|publisher=Access Intelligence, LLC|date=January 31, 2014|accessdate=March 28, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309103854/http://www.minonline.com/news/Through-Two-Owners-TV-Guide-Print-and-Digital-Content-Comes-Together_23673.html|archive-date=March 9, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Shift towards features====\nOn June 26, 2014, OpenGate Capital announced that ''TV Guide'' would undergo a major redesign beginning with the August 11 issue; the magazine eliminated 14 pages of listings, with the listings pages that remained displaying programming information for only top-rated broadcast and cable networks. It also added \"enhanced editorial features,\" including recommendation sections focusing on traditional television and online programming \u2013 such as additional content from senior critic Matt Roush (an expanded \"Roush Review\" column and an additional column featuring ten picks for each week's programs as selected by Roush) and several new sections (\"Upfront,\" featuring trending television-related stories, infographics, question-and-answer coluumns and [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] charts; \"The Guide,\" containing expanded highlights for each day's television programming, including sports, daytime programming and content available for [[streaming media|streaming]] online; a monthly television-related technology column; \"The TV Guide Interview,\" an occasional feature featuring celebrity interviews focusing on their career; and \"On Demand,\" a review column of movies premiering through streaming and [[video on demand|on-demand]] services). In addition, the magazine's size was reduced from 7\u00b3/\u2088\u00d710\u00bc inches to 7\u00d710 inches in a cost-saving measure; it also began to be distributed in airport newsstands.<ref>{{cite news|title=Changes in store for TV Guide|url=https://nypost.com/2014/06/26/changes-in-store-for-tv-guide/|author=Keith J.

TVGM Holdings [[chief executive officer]] David J.

NTVB already owned ''TV Weekly'' and ''Channel Guide'', both of which provide national editorial content and \u2013 through syndication agreements with 160+ newspapers throughout the country, in which they are distributed as supplementary publications incorporated within each paper's Sunday editions \u2013 listings customized for individual regions (the company began distributing its listings magazines in this manner in 2008, as newspapers began to cease publication of their proprietary television listings magazines due to cost-cutting measures spurred by declining circulation and revenue); it also publishes listings publications for pay television providers such as [[Comcast]], [[Time Warner Cable]] and [[Dish Network]]. As such, it is undetermined whether NTVB will reach deals to distribute ''TV Guide'' to newspapers on a separate basis or extend the name to its existing television publications. Staff with ''TV Guide'' and NTVB's other titles will collaborate on feature content included in the respective magazines, while the company will fold advertising sales for the magazine with its existing television magazine titles.<ref>{{cite web|title=TV Guide has been sold, yet again|url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/tv-guide-has-been-sold-yet-again/|author=Bill Cromwell|periodical=Media Life Magazine|date=October 8, 2015|accessdate=November 13, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=TV Guide Magazine Sold to NTVB Media|url=https://www.thewrap.com/tv-guide-magazine-sold-to-ntvb-media/|author=Jordan Chariton|website=The Wrap|publisher=The Wrap Media, LLC|date=October 7, 2015|accessdate=November 13, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=TV Guide Magazine is sold for the third time in less than 10 years to NTVB Media|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-tv-guide-magazine-sale-ntvb-media-20151007-story.html|author=Stephen Battaglio|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=October 7, 2015|accessdate=November 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Editions==\n{{main|List of TV Guide editions}}\nFrom the magazine's inception until the October 2005 conversion to national listings based on time zone, ''TV Guide'' maintained a local-national hybrid format with local editions tailored to a specific region or individual [[media market|market]]. Each regional edition generally served either a single city or a designated region (comprising the largest market[s] served by the edition and one or more smaller, adjacent markets, or a single or multiple neighboring [[U.S. state|states]] or [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]]). [[South Dakota]], [[Delaware]] and the [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]] did not have their own editions during the local listings era. In the case of the two U.S. states, [[Rapid City, South Dakota|Rapid City]] and [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]] (which had their corresponding television stations listed in the Northern Colorado and Nebraska statewide editions, respectively), were presumably both considered too small to have their own editions and were located too far away from one another to be included in one edition; Delaware is split between two markets \u2013 [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle]] and [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent]] counties are part of the Philadelphia market (which comprised two editions, the regional Southeast Pennsylvania edition and a market-specific edition for the Philadelphia area), while [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex County]] is part of the [[Salisbury, Maryland]], market (which had its stations listed in the Washington-Baltimore edition until 1994, and the Baltimore edition thereafter). Some editions that once provided statewide listings were eventually split off into separate editions that only provided listings for a specific region; in addition, certain markets have been added or dropped from some editions.\n\nBy the mid-1990s, nearly 150 editions of the magazine were published; during that decade, ''TV Guide'' began to diversify its editions from those for individual cities and multiple media markets within a given state or multi-state region to include editions for certain cable providers in larger television markets<ref name=\"moss\">{{cite web|title=TV Guide launches Continental editions.

Bullets used for broadcast stations contained a channel number, which had a different layout depending on the identified channel, and were often used in network promotional ads included to identify local affiliates carrying the advertised program. Filled black bullets with a white number overlaid on them designed local broadcast stations located in one of the primary market areas served by a specific edition; white bullets with a black screen outline indicated stations in outlying secondary markets covered by the corresponding edition. Out-of-market stations featured an alphanumeric identifier (with a letter next to the channel number) to disambiguate it from a local station, particularly in feature pages preceding the main listings (such as in the Northern Wisconsin edition, in which \"6M\" was used to disambiguate [[WLUC-TV]] in [[Marquette, Michigan]], from [[WITI (TV)|WITI]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], which only used a \"6\" as its identifier).\n\nThere were some exceptions to this formatting. For example, the [[Hawaii]] edition had the primary [[Honolulu]]-based stations listed first, followed by their satellite sister stations, while the [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], edition had that market's primary stations listed first, followed by the out-of-market outlets; the latter being unique with having the other stations listed below [[WPGH-TV|WPGH]] (channel 53) when it listed a show during non-network hours, and during a network-scheduled lineup \u2013 in this case, NBC \u2013 the primary station and channel being listed first \u2013 [[WPXI]] (11), followed by [[WJAC-TV]]/[[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown]] (6), [[WTOV-TV]]/[[Steubenville, Ohio|Steubenville]] (9), [[WBOY-TV]]/[[Clarksburg, West Virginia]] (12) and [[WFMJ-TV]]/[[Youngstown, Ohio]] (21) \u2013 instead of by order of over-the-air channel number for all stations. If a certain edition featured more than one station that transmitted on the same channel but served different markets, the primary station in the edition was designated by a black bullet with a white number, while the other was indicated by a white bullet with a black number; some editions have also used a split (half for stations broadcasting on frequencies from channel 10 and up; three split with the channel number in the middle) or vertical channel bullet if it covered a large area. At times, several editions with out-of-market channels would have the bullets changed, like the Memphis Edition, where stations outside the primary area (especially the original channels that served the [[WBBJ|Jackson, Tennessee]], [[KAIT-TV|Jonesboro, Arkansas]], and [[WTVA|Tupelo, Mississippi]] markets, which became part of the lineup since that edition's 1960 inception) that was listed in black bullet/white numbers was reconfigured to white bullet/black numbers after more stations were added in 1980.\n\nUpon the incorporation of those channels into the listings section in 1979\u201380, out-of-market superstations were first identified [[alphanumeric]]ally, indicating them by a combination of their over-the-air channel number and a letter representing their originating market city (as examples, [[WKBD-TV]] in [[Detroit]] \u2013 which effectively served as the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate for most of [[Michigan]] until December 1994 via cable \u2013 was listed as \"50D\", and [[KTVT]] in [[Dallas]]\u2013[[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] \u2013 which operated as a regional superstation in areas of [[Texas]] outside of its home market, [[Oklahoma]], [[Arkansas]] and [[Louisiana]] until the station's July 1995 conversion into a CBS affiliate \u2013 was listed as \"11F\"). By 1984, the three major national superstations at the time, [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]], [[WGN America|WGN]] and [[WWOR EMI Service|WOR]] (which were respectively identified as \"17A\", \"9C\" and \"9N\"), were given conventional abbreviated letter designations used by other cable channels. Alphanumeric identifiers were also used in some regional editions to disambiguate broadcast stations with identical channel numbers \u2013 usually for an out-of-market station, with the numeric identifier used for either a local or out-of-market station \u2013 in genre-based listings pages (such as the sports guide), cross-references in the pages preceding the local listings and within the listings section for stations serving as default network affiliates (via cable) in markets without a local major network outlets. (One notable exception was the [[New Mexico]] edition, which from 1984 until 2005, listed [[Los Angeles]] stations [[KTLA]], [[KTTV]] and [[KCOP-TV]], which were available via cable in some parts of the state at certain points during that period, under the codes \"TLA,\" \"COP\" and \"TTV\" instead of \"5L,\" \"11L\" and \"13L\".)\n\nThe outlined bullets that were originally used only for out-of-market television stations were also assigned to cable-originated channels when those began to be incorporated into the listings section in 1981, indicating those services by a three-letter abbreviation in a condensed typeface: for example, \"ESN\" represented ESPN, \"DSC\" represented [[Discovery Channel|The Discovery Channel]] and \"NIK\" represented Nickelodeon/[[Nick at Nite]]. ([[E!]] and [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] later became exceptions, as those channels were identified by two-letter abbreviations.) In certain cases, the abbreviation used (such as \"AMC\" for [[AMC (TV channel)|American Movie Classics]], \"TNT\" for \"[[TNT (U.S. TV network)|Turner Network Television]]\" and \"[[MTV]]\" for \"Music Television\") was that which the channel had already branded by ([[The Nashville Network]] [now [[Paramount Network]]] is a noted exception, as it was initially assigned the abbreviation \"NSH,\" instead of its network-assigned initialism \"TNN\"). Following that group's launch in September 1998, in editions in which one or more smaller markets served by said edition had local affiliates of the primarily cable-only service, affiliates of [[The WB 100+ Station Group]] were also identified in the same manner as conventional cable channels (under the abbreviation \"WB\") for brevity. Some [[PBS]] state or regional member networks were listed similarly in certain editions (such as Mississippi ETV [now [[Mississippi Public Broadcasting]]], which was listed in the Memphis edition under the code \"E\"). Two [[pay television|pay cable]] networks, [[Cinemax]] and [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] eventually [[rebrand]]ed in 1997 so that their respective ''TV Guide'' abbreviations \u2013 \"MAX\" and \"SHO\" \u2013 became the focal point of their logos. Some of the channels that were added to the prime time grids beginning with the September 12\u201318, 1998, issue were identified by four letter abbreviations (such as \"BBCA\" for [[BBC America]] and \"HBOS\" for HBO Signature). In cable-specific editions, a bullet indicating a broadcast or cable channel's local cable assignment (except where a broadcast station's cable channel assignment is the same as its over-the-air channel or where smaller cable systems are listed) appeared alongside the specific station or network indicator.\n\nSome cable channels \u2013 mainly premium channels \u2013 had an [[asterisk]] displayed by them in that edition's channel directory, which meant that it was only listed in the evening grid (and later the \"Pay-TV Movie Guide\"). Cable channels like Cinemax and [[Disney Channel|The Disney Channel]] initially had their programming listed exclusively within the prime time program grids in some editions of the magazine, but were later expanded to have their full daily schedules included in the log listings as well. In some larger markets where the local ''TV Guide'' edition maintained a regionalized format, [[pay-per-view]] services (such as [[Request TV]] and [[In Demand|Viewer's Choice]]) were also included in the prime time grids. By the mid-1990s, most editions of ''TV Guide'' provided program listings for nearly all cable channels featured in each issue within both the grids and the log listings, although some editions continued to list at least one channel, such as [[The Movie Channel]] (the only premium service that was excluded from the log listings in many editions by that point \u2013 though its inclusion in the log, as with select other cable channels, varied by market \u2013 until the September 1998 additions of [[Starz]], [[Starz Encore|Encore]], and HBO [[HBO#Channels|multiplex channels]] HBO Plus (now HBO2) and HBO3 (now HBO Signature) to the listings), exclusively in the grids. (Starz and Encore were listed in select markets where either network was available prior to being expanded to all local and regional editions with the 1998 \"Fall Preview\" issue.)\n\nIf the same program or episode was scheduled to air in the same timeslot on more than one channel, two or more bullets identifying each channel would precede the program title listed in a particular time entry. The usage of multiple bullets to denote stations airing the same program was a more common occurrence in instances where multiple broadcast stations aired the same [[television network|network]] program or their respective local news programs at the same time, although this also applied to broadcast and/or cable channels carrying the same episode of a syndicated program; separate time entries would only be used in this situation if the program had varying running times between channels (the grouping of bullets based on a station's affiliated network was later applied to the prime time grids beginning in September 2003). Another example would involve the synopsis or topic of the program listed; if the same description from the program aired on different channels later on in the day or during that week when it had aired first on another station listed in the edition, readers will notice \u201cSee ch.(xx) at (day/time) for details\u201d below the program.\n\n===Channel directory===\nFor much of the log listings era, the listings section was preceded by a channel directory, which listed the broadcast stations \u2013 and later, cable channels \u2013 whose program information was provided in each edition. The listed channels were organized numerically for broadcast stations and alphabetically (by abbreviation) for cable channels. Until cable-originated channels were added to the magazine, the directory exclusively listed broadcast television stations serving the individual markets serviced by the corresponding edition. Each station was listed in a separate entry corresponding to their [[city of license]], and in some cases, one or more stations serving a particular media market were broken out from competing stations serving the same market based on their primary city of service (for example, in the Oklahoma City/Oklahoma State and North Texas editions, ABC affiliate [[KSWO-TV]] in [[Lawton, Oklahoma]] \u2013 which was designated under a black bullet until the Oklahoma City and Tulsa editions were consolidated into a singular Oklahoma State edition in November 2003, when it began being identified by the outlined bullets assigned to its same-market competitors \u2013 was listed as serving \"Lawton/Wichita Falls,\" appearing in a separate entry from the three stations serving the primary city of that station's home market, [[Wichita Falls, Texas]], NBC affiliate [[KFDX-TV]], CBS affiliate [[KAUZ-TV]] and independent station-turned-Fox affiliate [[KJTL]]).\n\nThe directory originally appeared in the lower one-quarter of the listings section's first page; from the May 11\u201317, 1985, issue onward, it became a full-page insert that directly preceded the listings. Until the May 31\u2013June 6, 1969, issue, the directory also included studio addresses for each of the listed stations. Beginning with the June 7\u201313, 1969, issue, a foreword was included in the directory to denote that all [[public broadcasting|public television stations]] listed in the corresponding edition broadcast [[distance education|instructional programs]] for classroom use during the academic year; most editions did not provide listings for such programs, which were usually broadcast during the weekday morning and afternoon hours.\n\nAdditional forewording was added below the listed channels in the lineup page beginning with the September 10\u201316, 1983, \"Fall Preview\" issue (in select markets; expanded nationwide with the May 11\u201317, 1985, issue) that provided descriptions of channels that were not included in each issue; this foreword was removed beginning with the September 12, 1998, issue, as the magazine began adding many of the channels mentioned in that paragraph. If any broadcast television stations listed in a particular edition operated [[Broadcast relay station#Satellite stations|satellite stations]] to cover adjacent areas not adequately covered by the main signal, a notation listing each repeater \u2013 identified only by channel number \u2013 was included directing readers living in those areas to view programs on those station in correspondence to their originating station (for example, readers of the Northern Wisconsin edition would be guided to the following, \"for programs on [[WJMN-TV|3]] [[Escanaba, Michigan|Escanaba, Mich.]], see [[WFRV-TV|5]]; on 28 [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin|Eau Claire]], 31 [[La Crosse, Wisconsin|La Crosse]] and 55 [[Ellison Bay, Wisconsin|Ellison Bay, Wis.]], see [[Wisconsin Public Television|38]]; on [[WLWK-CD|22]] [[Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin|Sturgeon Bay]], see [[WGBA-TV|26]].\")\n\nFrom the magazine's incorporation of cable-originated channels in its local editions in 1982 until 1984/85, nationally distributed basic cable channels (such as ESPN, Nickelodeon, [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] and CNN) were typically separated from out-of-market stations distributed to area cable providers in the channel lineup page, under the heading \"Satellite Program Services,\" while premium channels (like HBO and Showtime) were categorized as \"Pay-TV Services\"; all cable channels listed in each edition were listed in alphabetical order thereafter, with premium services only being categorized separately from other cable channels in the prime time grids. Notations were also included in some editions, starting with the September 14\u201320, 1985 \"Fall Preview\" issue, to outline programming offered on certain local stations not listed in that edition. In some editions, particularly the \"Ultimate Cable\" and satellite editions, the channel lineup was diagrammed in the form of a conversion chart that listed each channel's assigned placement on cable and satellite providers as well as their VCR Plus+ code number; the lineup pages in some of the local editions switched to these charts beginning in 2003, listing channel slots for major cable providers within the local edition's home market (or in more regionalized editions, the largest markets served by that edition). The channel lineup page was dropped in June 2004 in most local editions.\n\n==Related services==\n===Television and digital services===\n====TV Guide Channel/Network====\n{{main|Pop (U.S. TV channel)}}\nIn June 1998, the ''TV Guide'' brand and magazine were acquired by [[Gemstar-TV Guide International|United Video Satellite Group]],<ref name=\"Gemstar\"/> the parent company of the Prevue Channel \u2013 a channel first launched in 1981 as the Electronic Program Guide network, that was carried by cable and some satellite television providers and was originally formatted to feature a [[electronic program guide|scrolling program guide]], short segments featuring previews of upcoming programs, and [[Promo (media)|promos]] and short-form [[Trailer (promotion)|film trailers]] for programs airing on various channels. Its new owners promptly rebranded Prevue as the '''TV Guide Channel''' on February 1, 1999. With the rebranding, some of the hourly segments featured on the channel at that point were renamed after features in the magazine, including ''TV Guide Close-Up'', ''TV Guide Sportsview'' (which was formatted more similarly to the listings section's sports guide than the color column of that name) and ''TV Guide Insider''. After Gemstar's acquisition of ''TV Guide'', the channel began to shift towards airing full-length programs featuring celebrity gossip and movie-focused talk shows alongside the program listings; the channel was rebranded as the '''TV Guide Network''' in 2007.\n\nFollowing the respective sales of TV Guide's magazine and cable channel by Macrovision to OpenGate Capital and Lionsgate,<ref name=\"OpenGate\"/><ref name=\"LionsgateTVGuide\"/> the magazine and TV Guide Network became operationally separate, although the two properties still collaborated on content for TVGuide.com.

Kootz|Samuel Kootz]]'s, a New York Gallery owner that helped determine what art was mainstream, pronouncement that there would be no women artists in his gallery.<ref name=\":0\" /> To this which Fine promptly said, \"I know I was as good as anybody else in there,\" <ref name=\":0\" /> However, Perle Fine was not the only female artist that was affected by this statement, artists such as [[Fannie Hillsmith]] and [[Lee Krasner]] were also deeply affected.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crichton-Miller|first=Emma|year=2016|title=Collectors' Focus Women Abstract Expressionists|url=|journal=Apollo: The International Magazine for Collectors|volume=|pages=100\u2013101|via=}}</ref>\n\nDespite Kootz's statement, Fine had been in many solo and group shows during the late 1940s. Because of her success with these exhibitions, there was every implication that Fine was on the verge of success in the art world.<ref name=\":0\" /> \"As the 1950s dawned ... there was little competition among artists either male or female, it was only when the door began to crack open that the gender of the artist began to play a more prominent role.\" <ref name=\":0\" /> [[Deirdre Robson]] has said that \"The arts were gradually thought of less in terms of being part of the 'female' realm and more as an interest suitable for a hardheaded and successful businessman.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFines\u2019 issues as a painter was not seen as cultural criticisms that kept her on the brinks of Abstract Expressionism when it should\u2019ve have had a place in the conversation but, it was the physical paintings themselves. She said it was always the painting rather than her being a woman and because of that, it pushed her into the artist she became. She battled with the canvas and solved problems in every piece. \u201cArt Historian, Ann Eden Gibson says that by the early 1950s, Fine was right in the middle of Abstract Expressionism\u201d. \n\nWith a career in abstract painting lasting over 50 years, Fine developed and stuck to high ideals and expectations of never adopting a method from another artist that could potentially compromise when work when her works of art began to become something that was not of the ordinary. She fought through barriers and limitation that any female artist would experience during the \u201cmacho milieu\u201d of Abstract Expressionism. She kept the mindset that it was what was painted and not who painted it that mattered. With that being said, her pieces are just now being given the attention they deserved a long time ago such as an exhibition in 2016 in the Denver Art Museum, \u201cWomen of Abstract Expression\u201d and Women of Abstract Expressionism from the 9th Street Show at the Katonah Museum of Art and Artistic License: Six Takes on the Guggenheim Collection. At the time, Fine was seen to be close with another Artist by the name of Mark Rothko. Her work also was seen to be similar to his but, Fine found her work not seeking his \u201csublime transcendence\u201d. \n\n==Biography==\nPerle Fine was born in [[Boston, MA]], in 1905.

Language Center |location=Fairbanks }}</ref> is a city in [[Aleutians East Borough, Alaska]], United States. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 108.\n\nCold Bay is one of the main commercial centers of the [[Alaska Peninsula]], and is home to [[Cold Bay Airport]].\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2010}}\nThere is evidence of prehistoric occupation by Aleuts and later Russian encampments. Cold Bay's significance to American history began with the Japanese [[invasion of the Aleutians]] in World War II. General [[Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr.]] ordered the creation of [[Fort Randall (Alaska)|Fort Randall]], an airbase on the shores of Cold Bay, in 1942 as a part of a general expansion of American assets in the Aleutians. It (along with Otter Point) served as a base for the [[11th Air Force]] to provide protection to the only deep water port in the Aleutians at the time, Dutch Harbor.\n\nThis protection was necessary when during [[Isoroku Yamamoto|Yamamoto]]'s [[Battle of Midway|Midway Campaign]], a diversionary attack was launched against Dutch Harbor. The initial attack was repulsed by the surprise presence of [[P-40]]s stationed here. A second larger attack with its own fighter escort the next day caused minor damage. Later, with the victory in the Pacific, the forces grew to 20,000 troops. The [[quonset hut]]s used to house this massive encampment still stand around the community. It also was a base of operations for the US Navy with the [[seaplane tender]] {{USS|Casco|AVP-12}} among the ships based in Cold Bay.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/c4/casco-iii.htm |publisher=U.S. Department of the Navy |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20130502082707/http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/c4/casco-iii.htm |archivedate=May 2, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nIn the spring and summer of 1945, Cold Bay was the site of the largest and most ambitious transfer program of World War II, [[Project Hula]], in which the United States transferred dozens of ships and craft to the [[Soviet Union]] and trained Soviet personnel in their operation in anticipation of the Soviet Union entering the [[Pacific War|war against Japan]].\n\nIn later decades, control of the airfield passed to civil authorities, who maintained it as a useful refueling and emergency landing location for [[great circle]] flights from the [[west coast of the United States]] to [[East Asia]].

The average household size was two and the average family size was three.\n\nAge distribution was 24% under the age of 18, 9% from 18 to 24, 40% from 25 to 44, 27% from 45 to 64. The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females, there were 184 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 205 males.\n\nThe [[median household income]] was $55,750, and the median family income was $64,375. Males had a median income of $36,250 versus $38,333 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $20,037.

The Bearfoot Inn also offers lodging with its 8-room hotel and 6-room bunk house. Within the main building there is the Bearfoot Inn Bar which is open 3 to 6 days a week depending on the season. Bearfoot Inn is within walking distance of the airport.\n\nThe Cold Bay Lodge is the only restaurant in town. The lodge can accommodate up to about 40 people (38 beds), offers wireless Internet access, holds a liquor license, is less than a mile from the airport and offers trinkets and snacks.\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Traditions===\nA major community event is the Silver Salmon Derby, a fishing contest that takes place every fall. Participants vie in both adult and child categories for cash prizes for the largest fish. A raft race and \"Polar Bear Jump\" are also held.

|publisher=Alaska Native Language Center |location=Fairbanks }}</ref> is a city in [[Aleutians East Borough, Alaska]], United States. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 108.\n\nCold Bay is one of the main commercial centers of the [[Alaska Peninsula]], and is home to [[Cold Bay Airport]].\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2010}}\nThere is evidence of prehistoric occupation by Aleuts and later Russian encampments. Cold Bay's significance to American history began with the Japanese invasion of the Aleutians in World War II. General [[Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr.]] ordered the creation of [[Fort Randall (Alaska)|Fort Randall]], an airbase on the shores of Cold Bay, in 1942 as a part of a general expansion of American assets in the Aleutians. It (along with Otter Point) served as a base for the [[11th Air Force]] to provide protection to the only deep water port in the Aleutians at the time, Dutch Harbor.\n\nThis protection was necessary when during [[Isoroku Yamamoto|Yamamoto]]'s Midway Campaign a diversionary attack was launched against Dutch Harbor. The initial attack was repulsed by the surprise presence of [[P-40]]s stationed here. A second larger attack with its own fighter escort the next day caused minor damage. Later, with the victory in the Pacific, the forces grew to 20,000 troops. The [[quonset hut]]s used to house this massive encampment still stand around the community. It also was a base of operations for the US Navy with the [[seaplane tender]] {{USS|Casco|AVP-12}} among the ships based in Cold Bay.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/c4/casco-iii.htm |publisher=U.S. Department of the Navy |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20130502082707/http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/c4/casco-iii.htm |archivedate=May 2, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nIn the spring and summer of 1945, Cold Bay was the site of the largest and most ambitious transfer program of World War II, [[Project Hula]], in which the United States transferred dozens of ships and craft to the [[Soviet Union]] and trained Soviet personnel in their operation in anticipation of the Soviet Union entering the [[Pacific War|war against Japan]].\n\nIn later decades, control of the airfield passed to civil authorities, who maintained it as a useful refueling and emergency landing location for [[great circle]] flights from the [[west coast of the United States]] to [[East Asia]]. A [[Distant Early Warning Line]] station established nearby was eventually decommissioned.\n\nDuring the 1980s, deregulation of the airline industry under President [[Ronald Reagan]] caused many of the compelling interests{{who|date=December 2014}} supporting the need for the community to evaporate. Today, Cold Bay is still occasionally used for emergency or precautionary landings of commercial flights, and is also a hub for traffic from [[Anchorage]] and [[Seattle]] to the small communities around it.\n\n==Geography==\nCold Bay is located at {{Coord|55|12|33|N|162|42|51|W|type:city}} (55.209038, -162.714298).<ref name=\"GR12\">{{cite web|url = https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher = [[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate = April 23, 2011|date = February 12, 2011|title = US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is west of [[Hawaii]].\n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|70.9|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|54.4|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|16.6|sqmi|km2}} of it (23.34%) is water.\n\nCold Bay holds the record for most overcast community in America.<ref name=\"currentresults.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.currentresults.com/Weather-Extremes/US/cloudiest.php|title=Cloudiest Places in United States - Current Results|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nCold Bay has an either an ocean-moderated [[subarctic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: '''Dfc''') if the 0&nbsp;\u00b0C isotherm is used, or a [[subpolar oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: '''Cfc''') if the {{convert|\u22123|\u00b0C|1}} isotherm is used, both of those climate being typical of southwest Alaska, though the summers are almost cool enough to qualify as a [[tundra climate|tundra]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: '''ET''').

The average household size was two and the average family size was three.\n\nAge distribution was 24% under the age of 18, 9% from 18 to 24, 40% from 25 to 44, 27% from 45 to 64. The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females, there were 184 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 205 males.\n\nThe [[median household income]] was $55,750, and the median family income was $64,375.
