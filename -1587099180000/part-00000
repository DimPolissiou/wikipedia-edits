The first chapter explains how the French created a politically balanced democracy by putting in place a president \"monarch\" who enjoys more power than heads of state in any [[modern democracy]]. The other 10 chapters explain the value the French place on equality and the principle of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]], and how they have struggled to create a unified French national identity from the hodge-podge of extremely diverse cultures.\n\nPart 3, Change, explains in four chapters how France is evolving in terms of its worldview, [[demography]] and political institutions, both because of internal forces and the influence of the [[European Union]].\n\n== Publication ==\nThe book was published in April 2003, in the middle of the [[Iraq War]]. The French had refused to endorse the [[US invasion of Iraq]], which happened without UN's approval, triggering an intense wave of anti-French sentiment, which culminated in the call to rebrand French fries, \"freedom fries.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Nadeau|first=Jean-Beno\u00eet|title=\u00c9crire pour vivre|year=2007|publisher=\u00c9ditions Qu\u00e9bec Am\u00e9rique|location=Montr\u00e9al|isbn=978-2-7644-0541-3|url=https://archive.org/details/ecrirepourvivrec0000nade/page/95|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ecrirepourvivrec0000nade/page/95 95]}}</ref>\n\nThe British edition was published by Robson Books in April 2004 during the centennial of the [[Entente Cordiale]] between France and the [[United Kingdom]] and the book appeared in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] at the same time. In 2004, Jean-Beno\u00eet Nadeau adapted and updated the book before translating it. The French edition was published by Seuil with the title ''Pas si fous, ces Fran\u00e7ais!'' Two [[Mandarin language varieties|Mandarin]] editions appeared in 2004 and 2005, one in simplified, and the other in traditional Mandarin.\n\n== Trivia ==\n\nThe title for the book, chosen in 2001, was inspired by Cole Porter\u2019s title song for his musical ''[[Fifty Million Frenchmen]]''. It is a good summary of the authors\u2019 intent of explaining the French in their own terms.<ref name=\"SMF\" />\n\nThe first print (2000 copies) of the American edition of ''Sixty Million Frenchmen Can\u2019t Be Wrong'' features an upside down [[French flag]] with the red color near the flagpole. This mistake was corrected in the subsequent prints, but copies of the book with the upside-down flag still circulate.<ref name=\"SMF\" />\n\n== Other books ==\nJean-Beno\u00eet Nadeau also wrote about their first two-year stay in Paris in a separate humorous travelogue titled ''Les Fran\u00e7ais aussi ont un accent'' (The French Also Have an Accent), published by French publisher Payot.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nadeau|first1=Jean-Beno\u00eet|title=Les Fran\u00e7ais aussi ont un accent'|date=2002|publisher=Payot|isbn=222889561X}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013\u20132014, the authors spent a year in France researching a new book on the French, ''The Bonjour Effect: The Secret Codes of French Conversation Revealed'' (St. Martin's Press, 2016). This new book is not an update of ''Sixty Million Frenchmen Can't Be Wrong'', but it uses a similar approach to analyze and describe the way the French talk \u2013 about small things and big issues, themselves and the world around them, including their own taboos.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Bonjour Effect|url=http://nadeaubarlow.com/books/|website=Nadeau & Barlow}}</ref>\n\n''Sixty Million Frenchmen Can't Be Wrong'' inspired the authors' second book, ''The Story of French'', (St. Martin\u2019s Press, Knopf Canada and Anova-Robson Books, 2006), a history of French language as it's spoken across the planet.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nadeau|first1=Jean-Beno\u00eet|last2=Barlow|first2=Julie|title=The Story of French|date=2008|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-34184-8|page=5|url=http://us.macmillan.com/books/9780312341848}}</ref> There are two versions of the book in French, one published in Quebec in 2007 with the title ''La Grande Aventure de la langue fran\u00e7aise''.

Collecting expeditions ground to a halt with the occurrence of World War II, not resuming until the 1950s and 1960s, when studies examined the Komodo dragon's feeding behavior, reproduction, and body temperature. At around this time, an expedition was planned in which a long-term study of the Komodo dragon would be undertaken. This task was given to the Auffenberg family, who stayed on Komodo Island for 11 months in 1969.

Around 15 million years ago, a collision between the continental landmasses of Australia and Southeast Asia allowed these larger varanids to move back into what is now the Indonesian archipelago, extending their range as far east as the island of [[Timor]]. The Komodo dragon is believed to have differentiated from its Australian ancestors about 4 million years ago.

Bites on human digits by a [[lace monitor]] (''V. varius''), a Komodo dragon, and a spotted tree monitor (''V. scalaris'') all produced similar effects: rapid swelling, localised disruption of blood clotting, and shooting pain up to the elbow, with some symptoms lasting for several hours.<ref name=\"Fry2006\">{{cite journal|year= 2006 |title= Early evolution of the venom system in lizards and snakes|journal= Nature|volume= 439|pages= 584\u2013588|doi = 10.1038/nature04328|url=http://www.naherpetology.org/pdf_files/467.pdf |pmid = 16292255|last1 = Fry|first1 = BG|last2 = Vidal|first2 = N|last3 = Norman|first3 = JA|last4 = Vonk|first4 = FJ|last5 = Scheib|first5 = H|last6 = Ramjan|first6 = SF|last7 = Kuruppu|first7 = S|last8 = Fung|first8 = K|last9 = Hedges|first9 = SB|last10= Richardson|first10= Michael K.|last11= Hodgson|first11= Wayne.

Around 15 million years ago, a collision between the continental landmasses of Australia and Southeast Asia allowed these larger varanids to move back into what is now the Indonesian archipelago, extending their range as far east as the island of [[Timor]].

House also asks Cameron to read a medical journal which states that Dr.Ezra Powell had performed radiology treatment as an experiment on many babies without the consent of their parent. House notices that Powell has lost reflex capabilities in his right arm, and wakes Powell from his coma to find that Powell has also lost sensation in his abdomen and right leg.\n\nHouse ends up diagnosing Powell with [[amyloidosis]] and Chase finds that it is of [[AA amyloidosis|sub-type AA]], and therefore is a terminal illness.
