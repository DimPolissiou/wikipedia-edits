It has a population of around 16,000. \n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Location ===\nMichelstadt is the biggest town in the Odenwaldkreis and borders on the district seat of [[Erbach (Odenwald)|Erbach]].\n\n=== Neighbouring municipalities ===\nMichelstadt borders in the north on the municipality of [[Brombachtal]], the town of [[Bad K\u00f6nig]] and the municipality of [[L\u00fctzelbach]], in the east on the town of [[Klingenberg am Main|Klingenberg]], the market municipalities of [[Laudenbach, Bavaria|Laudenbach]] and [[Kleinheubach]], the town of [[Miltenberg]], the market municipality of [[Weilbach, Germany|Weilbach]], the town of [[Amorbach]] and the market municipality of [[Kirchzell]] (all seven in [[Miltenberg (district)|Miltenberg district]] in [[Bavaria]]), in the south on the town of [[Erbach im Odenwald|Erbach]], and in the west on the municipalities of [[Mossautal]] and [[Reichelsheim (Odenwald)|Reichelsheim]].\n\n=== Constituent communities ===\nMichelstadt's ''[[Ortsteil|Stadtteile]]'', besides the main town, also called Michelstadt, are Rehbach, Steinbach, Steinbuch, Stockheim, Vielbrunn, Weiten-Ges\u00e4\u00df and W\u00fcrzberg.\n\n== History ==\nMichelstadt had its first documentary mention in 741 from [[Mayor of the Palace]] [[Carloman, Mayor of the Palace|Carloman]], [[Charlemagne]]\u2019s uncle.\n\nMichelstadt is one of the oldest settlements in the inner Odenwald. Its [[castle]] grew out of a [[Franks|Frankish]] baronial estate. This was built into a refuge for the local inhabitants. As a royal estate, Prince Carloman donated it in 741 to [[Saint Boniface]]\u2019s pupil [[Burchard of W\u00fcrzburg|Burchard]], the first Bishop of [[Bishopric of Wurzburg|W\u00fcrzburg]]. This donation was apparently meant for Bishop Burchard personally, for the ''Michelnstat'' area passed back to the Frankish Crown upon Burchard\u2019s death in 791.\n\n[[Image:Michelstadt-Fachwerkhaeuser.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Timber framing|Timber-frame]] house at the marketplace with the market well]]\nIn 815, the ''Michlinstat'' area was donated once again. In recognition of his great merit as confidant at Charlemagne\u2019s court, [[Einhard]] acquired the main town and all land within two [[League (unit)|leagues]] (roughly 15&nbsp;km) from Charlemagne\u2019s son, [[Louis the Pious]], as a freehold. Einhard also built the ''[[:de:Einhardsbasilika (Steinbach)|Einhardsbasilika]]''. In 819, he bequeathed his Odenwald holdings to [[Lorsch Abbey]] and in so doing precisely defined the boundaries of the ''Mark Michelstadt''. Upon Einhard\u2019s death on 14 March 840, the monastery came into its inheritance.\n\n[[Image:Michelstadt-Rathaus-Wappen.JPG|thumb|150px|Old [[coat of arms]] at the town hall from 1743]]\nIn the 17th century, the first houses outside the town wall were built. In 1773, a new town gate was built, called the ''Neutor'' (\u201cNew Gate\u201d). In the 19th century, the gate towers were all torn down one after the other.\n\nIn 1806, Michelstadt, along with the [[County of Erbach]], passed to the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]].\n\nThe building of the [[railway]] line and its completion through to [[Darmstadt]] in 1870 and then [[Eberbach (Baden)|Eberbach]] in 1881 brought Michelstadt a sharp economic upswing. Out of what was once a small farming community grew a sizeable town with important industrial operations on the foundation of the centuries-old [[ironworking]]. A new economic era began. From the clothweavers\u2019 and dyers\u2019 guild grew a cloth factory; from foundries grew machine factories. [[Ivory]] carving was a starting point for businesses in the souvenir industry and plastics processing.\n\nIn 1962, the town hosted the second ''[[Hessentag]]'' state festival.\n\nIn 2007, a decision to merge the town with the neighbouring town of Erbach was thwarted by a civic vote.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hr-online.de/website/fernsehen/sendungen/index.jsp?rubrik=3058&key=standard_document_33392026&msg=1987 |title=Proposed merger of Michelstadt and Erbach |access-date=2009-01-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521032704/http://www.hr-online.de/website/fernsehen/sendungen/index.jsp?rubrik=3058&key=standard_document_33392026&msg=1987 |archive-date=2011-05-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Governance==\n\nThe municipal election held 2006 and 2016 yielded the following results:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|---  class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\"\n|colspan=\"2\" | '''Parties and voter communities'''\n|align=\"center\" | '''%<br />2006'''\n|align=\"center\" | '''Seats<br />2006'''\n|align=\"center\" | '''Seats<br />2016'''\n|----\n|SPD\n|[[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]\n|align=\"right\" |36.7\n|align=\"right\" |14\n|align=\"right\" |12\n|----\n|CDU\n|[[Christian Democratic Union of Germany]]\n|align=\"right\" |27.4\n|align=\"right\" |10\n|align=\"right\" |7\n|----\n|\u00dcWG\n|\u00dcberparteiliche W\u00e4hlergemeinschaft\n|align=\"right\" |22.8\n|align=\"right\" |8\n|align=\"right\" |11\n|----\n|GREENS\n|[[B\u00fcndnis 90/Die Gr\u00fcnen]]\n|align=\"right\" |9.4\n|align=\"right\" |4\n|align=\"right\" |4\n|----\n|FDP\n|[[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]]\n|align=\"right\" |3.7\n|align=\"right\" |1\n|align=\"right\" |3\n|---- class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\"\n|colspan=\"2\" |'''Total'''\n|align=\"right\" |'''100.0'''\n|align=\"right\" |'''37'''\n|align=\"right\" |'''100.0'''\n|align=\"right\" |'''37'''\n|---- class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\"\n|colspan=\"2\" |'''Voter turnout in %'''\n|colspan=\"2\" align=\"right\" |'''49.3'''\n|}\nThe voter turnout in 2016 was 49,7 %.\n\n=== Mayor ===\nThe mayor, Stephan Kelbert, in office since 16 September 2009, was elected on 8 March 2009 with a share of 52.7% in the first round of voting.\n\n=== Town partnerships ===\n*{{flagicon|France}} [[Rumilly, Haute-Savoie|Rumilly]], [[Haute-Savoie]], [[France]]\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Hulst]], [[Zeeuws Vlaanderen]], [[Netherlands]]\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe town's [[Coat of arms|arms]] might be described thus: Per fess azure two mullets Or and Or diapered.\n\nMichelstadt was granted these arms in 1541 along with its new seal by Count Georg of Erbach. The [[diapering]] in the lower half of the [[escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] is unhistoric, and only appeared in the 17th century. Indeed, the escutcheon on the Town Hall, pictured in this article, does not show it. The mullets (six-pointed star shapes) come from the Counts' arms, but why the parting per fess (horizontal division across the middle) was chosen is a mystery. Except for the diapering, the arms have not changed since the 16th century.<ref>[http://www.ngw.nl/int/dld/m/michelst.htm Description and explanation of Michelstadt\u2019s arms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613211242/http://www.ngw.nl/int/dld/m/michelst.htm |date=2007-06-13 }}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n=== Notable companies ===\n* [[M\u00fchlh\u00e4user]], a manufacturer of railbound and trackless tunnel construction equipment\n\n== Arts and culture==\n\n=== Theatre ===\n*''Kleinkunstb\u00fchne Patat'' (cabaret)\n*''Michelst\u00e4dter Theatersommer'', yearly open-air plays in the historic ''Kellereihof''\n*''Theaterkarren e.V.

Lichtigfeld-Museum'' (State Rabbi Lichtigfeld)\n*''Privates Elfenbeinmuseum Ulrich Seidenberg'' (private ivory museum)\n*''Motorrad-Museum'' (motorcycles)\n\n=== Buildings===\nMichelstadt's Old Town features many [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses. Particularly worthy of mention are the following buildings, some within the old town, others in the surrounding countryside: The historic Town Hall, the ''Diebsturm'' (\"Thief's Tower\") at the town wall, the ''Kellereihof'' (a Frankish, early mediaeval castle complex refurbished in an early [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] style) in the town wall ring, the late [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] town church (late 13th century), the ''Einhards-Basilika'', the palace of the Counts at Erbach-F\u00fcrstenau (''Schloss F\u00fcrstenau'', within which are parts of an old [[moat]]ed castle in Michelstadt-Steinbach), ''Jagdschloss Eulbach'' with an [[English landscape garden]] and a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] bath and [[castra]], formerly part of the [[Neckar-Odenwald Limes]].\n\n==== Historic Town Hall ====\n[[Image:Michelstadt Rathaus 2.jpg|right|200px|thumb|<center>Town Hall</center>]]\n[[Image:Michelstadt-Diebsturm.JPG|thumb|200px|''Diebsturm'' at the town wall]]\n\nMichelstadt's timber-frame town hall, whose image was used on a [[Deutsche Post]] [[Postage stamp|stamp]], was built in 1484 in the late Gothic style and later remodelled on the inside many times; from 1743 to 1903 it was covered in [[Shake (shingle)|shakes]]. The town hall's main floor served from the beginning as a market hall, and was built using [[jettying]]. The back (east) wall was originally part of the [[graveyard]] wall, upon which the ground floor's upper bressumer was laid. To this day it is unknown who the master builder was, although it is assumed that the driving force behind the project could have been ''Schenk'' Adolar von Erbach and Bishop Johann von [[Dalberg]] (his adviser).\n\n==== Late Gothic town church ====\nThe town church, completed in 1490, was built to replace a [[Carolingian]] stone church by Einhard, itself built on the site of a former wooden church. The nave's columns and the two aisles' walls were built in 1475. The quire dates from 1461; the antechoir's north wall is even older \u2013 Carolingian. Until the 1970s, the church housed one of the most valuable libraries in Germany in its belltower containing more than a thousand volumes belonging to Michelstadt-born Nicolaus Matz, who was capitular in [[Speyer]], and who bequeathed this collection to his hometown and its citizens in the late 14th century. Since the 1970s the library has been housed in a storehouse specially converted for it at the Michelstadt coaching inn that belonged to the [[Thurn und Taxis]] noble family, who played a key r\u00f4le in [[Europe]]an [[Mail|postal services]] in the 16th century. The former church on this spot was built over a brook that comes up here, called the ''Kiliansflo\u00df'', an early [[Celts|Celtic]]-[[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] worship site and later a Roman [[Mithraic Mysteries|Mithraic]] worship site. The thus channelled ''Kiliansflo\u00df'' fed not only the baptismal font, but also all the town's fountains. The ''Kiliansflo\u00df'', however, does not actually rise here, but rather far outside the town. It then disappears into the ground not far from the graveyard, springing up again in the middle of town.\n\n====Einhard's Basilica in the outlying centre of Steinbach====\n[[Image:Einhardsbasilika bei Michelstadt.jpg|left|250px|thumb|<center>Einhard's Basilica</center>]]\n\nThe ''Einhards-Basilika'' was built by [[Einhard]], Charlemagne's chronicler and confidant. The Carolingian church built between 824 and 827 is one of the very few Carolingian buildings that have survived largely intact. The [[Basilica]]'s [[crypt]] once housed [[Marcellinus and Peter|Saints Peter's and Marcellinus's]] [[relic]]s, which had been stolen from Rome on Einhard's instructions by his notary Ratleik. His servants' nightmares and the remains' \"sweating blood\" there, however, made Einhard think that this arrangement did not feel right. He thus transferred himself, his wife, the relics and his seat to Ober-Mulinheim am Main, now known as [[Seligenstadt]], which thereby became a [[pilgrimage]] site with a new, larger basilica.\n\nThe story that has been handed down says that the relics hidden from Rome were transported to [[Saint-Maurice, Switzerland|Saint-Maurice-en-Valais]], now in [[Switzerland]], whence they were then brought to Michelstadt by a cheering pilgrimage procession.\n\nThe Basilica in Steinbach was converted, expanded, and rededicated many times and later served first as a [[hospital]] and then in the 17th century as a barn. Once it was rediscovered in 1873 as being Carolingian, the exploration and safeguarding of the parts of the basilica that were still intact began.\n\nThe ''Einhards-Basilika'' was until 1967 owned by the princely Counts of Erbach-F\u00fcrstenau. The grounds are now owned by the state of Hesse.\n\n====The palace of the Counts of Erbach-F\u00fcrstenau in the outlying centre of Steinbach ====\n[[Image:Schlossfuerstenau2.jpg|250px|thumb|<center>''Schloss F\u00fcrstenau'' with decorative gateway arch (1588)</center>]]\n[[Image:Schlossfuerstenau1.jpg|right|250px|thumb|<center>New palace (left), ''Schloss F\u00fcrstenau''</center>]]\n\nThe palace complex is a series of building styles which includes remains of the old [[Electorate of Mainz]] border fortifications and moated castle (about 1300) on the north side to the Gothic works by the stonecutters who came from [[Strasbourg]] to Steinbach, to the gigantic Renaissance-style gateway arch (1588) between the moated castle's two western corner towers which replaced the castle wall and opened the gloomy, dank courtyard back up to the former castle garden, to the Renaissance palace mill, a former [[mint (coin)|mint]] (today a [[Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity|run-of-the-river hydroelectric station]]), to the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] ''Kavaliershaus'' (a palace outbuilding for staff and guests) on the M\u00fcmling, to the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] residential wing, the ''Neues Palais'' (1810/11) and the late Baroque [[orangery]] in the palace park, which was built in the English style. The orangery's upper floor housed the small palace theatre.\n\n''Schloss F\u00fcrstenau'' is still a dwelling, with the head of the house of the princely Counts of Erbach-F\u00fcrstenau and his family still living there. The former Electorate of Mainz defence facility lay on the property of the ''Schenk'' of Erbach (a forefather of the noble family, which at that time had not yet branched) and passed into his ownership in 1355. Public access to the ground and is possible by day. At the outer bailey with its gateway arch from 1765 some [[Visual arts|visual artists]] have taken up residence (in among other places the former stables from after 1765).\n\n==== Roman bath and castra ====\nRight near W\u00fcrzberg, in the middle of a clearing are found the remains of the Roman [[Castra|Castrum]] of W\u00fcrzberg, which was built about AD 100 as part of the Neckar-Odenwald-[[Limes (Roman Empire)|Limes]], and was used for about 60 years before the border was shifted farther east. The castrum can only be made out by an earthen wall. The Roman bathhouse, on the other hand, which stands right next to the castrum, has been partially restored; the floors have been replaced and the wall has been built back up to a height of about a metre. Despite the bath's small size, which was only meant for the fort's 120-man garrison, the design of a Roman bathhouse is easily recognizable.\n\nNot far from the outlying centre of Vielbrunn, in the area around the former hunting palace of the [[L\u00f6wenstein-Wertheim|Princes of L\u00f6wenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg]], traces of the Castrum of Hainhaus can still be found. Furthermore, on Michelstadt's eastern outskirts can be found the Castrum of Eulbach near the ''Eulbacher Park'', a landscaped English park from the early 19th century with its hunting palace and an adjoining wildlife park.\n\n==== Other structures ====\n* W\u00fcrzberg Transmission Mast\n* ESOC-Bodenstation Michelstadt (disused satellite ground receiving station)\n\n=== Regular events ===\n*''Michelst\u00e4dter Bienenmarkt'' (\"bee market\") \u2013 Held each year at [[Whitsun]], it was started by former mayor Hasenzahl in 1954.\n*''Musiknacht'' \u2013 Each year, various concert productions take place in the Old Town with many different kinds of music.\n*Church Consecration Festival with ''Weinbrunnenfest'' \u2013 From the Old Town's many fountains, wine is given out by the many wine cellars and businesses at the ''Weinbrunnenfest'' (\"Wine Fountain Festival\"), which is actually Michelstadt's traditional [[folk festival]], at which all the town's countless fountains are decorated.\n*Michelstadt Christmas Market \u2013 this is still quite a new creation of the television-sponsored ''Stadtmarketing'' (\"town marketing\") of the late 1960s. The opening always takes place on the Friday before the onset of [[Advent]]. \n*''Michelst\u00e4dter Theatersommer'' \u2013 since 2003 a yearly open-air theatrical festival, initiated by the Michelstadt \"theatremakers\" Alexander Kaffenberger and Dirk Daniel Zucht.\n\n== Infrastructure==\n=== Transport ===\nIn Michelstadt the two ''[[Bundesstra\u00dfe]]n'' 45 and 47 intersect, both are old trade roads from [[Frankfurt am Main]] to [[Augsburg]] and from [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] to [[W\u00fcrzburg]] respectively.\n\nThe town is served by a [[railway station]] on the [[Odenwald Railway (Hesse)|''Odenwaldbahn'']] (RMV Line 65; [[Eberbach (Baden)|Eberbach]] \u2013 [[Erbach im Odenwald|Erbach]] \u2013 Michelstadt \u2013 [[Darmstadt]] \u2013 Frankfurt / [[Hanau]]). [[Regionalbahn]], Stadtexpress and [[Regionalexpress]] trains of the [[Vias (rail company)|VIAS GmbH]] stop here.\n\nThere is also the special landing facility ''Flugplatz Michelstadt'' (airfield), which lies roughly 2&nbsp;km from the town and is run by a club.\n\n== Education ==\n* ''Stadtschule Michelstadt'' ([[primary school]])\n* ''Schule am Hollerbusch'' (primary school)\n* ''Einhardschule'' (primary school in the outlying centre of Steinbach)\n* ''Grundschule Vielbrunn'' (primary school)\n* ''Theodor-Litt-Schule'' ([[Realschule]] and [[Hauptschule]])\n* ''[[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]] Michelstadt''\n* Odenwaldkreis Vocational Schools (including, among others, [[Education in Germany|Berufsschule, Berufsfachschule and Berufliches Gymnasium]], nowadays known as ''BSO \u2013 Europaschule''.\n\n== Notable people ==\n* [[Sekl Loeb Wormser|Seckel L\u00f6b Wormser]] (b. 1768 in Michelstadt, d. 1847 in Michelstadt), Kabbalist\n* [[Fritz Kredel]] (b. 8 February 1900 in Michelstadt, d. 11 June 1973 in New York)\n* [[Dietrich Schenk von Erbach]] (d. 1459), Archbishop of Mainz (from 1434 to 1459)\n* Bernhard Koziol, founder of the [[:de:Koziol]] plastics company ([[injection moulding]])\n* [[Gabriele von Lutzau]] (b. 1954), sculptor, lives and works in Michelstadt\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|Nicolaus Matz|de}}, rector of the [[University of Freiburg]], capitular in Speyer\n* [[Rebecca Horn]] (b. 1944), artist\n* [[Stefan Seeger]] (b. 1962), chemist, university professor and entrepreneur\n* [[Jessica Schwarz]] (b. 1977), moderator and actress\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Wolfgang Hartmann: ''Zu den fr\u00fchen urkundlichen Erw\u00e4hnungen von Michelstadt im Odenwald.''

It has a population of around 16,000. \n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Location ===\nMichelstadt is the biggest town in the Odenwaldkreis and borders on the district seat of [[Erbach (Odenwald)|Erbach]].\n\n=== Neighbouring municipalities ===\nMichelstadt borders in the north on the municipality of [[Brombachtal]], the town of [[Bad K\u00f6nig]] and the municipality of [[L\u00fctzelbach]], in the east on the town of [[Klingenberg am Main|Klingenberg]], the market municipalities of [[Laudenbach, Bavaria|Laudenbach]] and [[Kleinheubach]], the town of [[Miltenberg]], the market municipality of [[Weilbach, Germany|Weilbach]], the town of [[Amorbach]] and the market municipality of [[Kirchzell]] (all seven in [[Miltenberg (district)|Miltenberg district]] in [[Bavaria]]), in the south on the town of [[Erbach im Odenwald|Erbach]], and in the west on the municipalities of [[Mossautal]] and [[Reichelsheim (Odenwald)|Reichelsheim]].\n\n=== Constituent communities ===\nMichelstadt's ''[[Ortsteil|Stadtteile]]'', besides the main town, also called Michelstadt, are Rehbach, Steinbach, Steinbuch, Stockheim, Vielbrunn, Weiten-Ges\u00e4\u00df and W\u00fcrzberg.\n\n== History ==\nMichelstadt had its first documentary mention in 741 from [[Mayor of the Palace]] [[Carloman, Mayor of the Palace|Carloman]], [[Charlemagne]]\u2019s uncle.\n\nMichelstadt is one of the oldest settlements in the inner Odenwald. Its [[castle]] grew out of a [[Franks|Frankish]] baronial estate. This was built into a refuge for the local inhabitants. As a royal estate, Prince Carloman donated it in 741 to [[Saint Boniface]]\u2019s pupil [[Burchard of W\u00fcrzburg|Burchard]], the first Bishop of [[Bishopric of Wurzburg|W\u00fcrzburg]]. This donation was apparently meant for Bishop Burchard personally, for the ''Michelnstat'' area passed back to the Frankish Crown upon Burchard\u2019s death in 791.\n\n[[Image:Michelstadt-Fachwerkhaeuser.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Timber framing|Timber-frame]] house at the marketplace with the market well]]\nIn 815, the ''Michlinstat'' area was donated once again. In recognition of his great merit as confidant at Charlemagne\u2019s court, [[Einhard]] acquired the main town and all land within two [[League (unit)|leagues]] (roughly 15&nbsp;km) from Charlemagne\u2019s son, [[Louis the Pious]], as a freehold. Einhard also built the ''[[:de:Einhardsbasilika (Steinbach)|Einhardsbasilika]]''. In 819, he bequeathed his Odenwald holdings to [[Lorsch Abbey]] and in so doing precisely defined the boundaries of the ''Mark Michelstadt''. Upon Einhard\u2019s death on 14 March 840, the monastery came into its inheritance.\n\n[[Image:Michelstadt-Rathaus-Wappen.JPG|thumb|150px|Old [[coat of arms]] at the town hall from 1743]]\nIn the 17th century, the first houses outside the town wall were built. In 1773, a new town gate was built, called the ''Neutor'' (\u201cNew Gate\u201d). In the 19th century, the gate towers were all torn down one after the other.\n\nIn 1806, Michelstadt, along with the [[County of Erbach]], passed to the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]].\n\nThe building of the [[railway]] line and its completion through to [[Darmstadt]] in 1870 and then [[Eberbach (Baden)|Eberbach]] in 1881 brought Michelstadt a sharp economic upswing. Out of what was once a small farming community grew a sizeable town with important industrial operations on the foundation of the centuries-old [[ironworking]]. A new economic era began. From the clothweavers\u2019 and dyers\u2019 guild grew a cloth factory; from foundries grew machine factories. [[Ivory]] carving was a starting point for businesses in the souvenir industry and plastics processing.\n\nIn 1962, the town hosted the second ''[[Hessentag]]'' state festival.\n\nIn 2007, a decision to merge the town with the neighbouring town of Erbach was thwarted by a civic vote.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hr-online.de/website/fernsehen/sendungen/index.jsp?rubrik=3058&key=standard_document_33392026&msg=1987 |title=Proposed merger of Michelstadt and Erbach |access-date=2009-01-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521032704/http://www.hr-online.de/website/fernsehen/sendungen/index.jsp?rubrik=3058&key=standard_document_33392026&msg=1987 |archive-date=2011-05-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Governance==\n\nThe municipal election held 2006 and 2016 yielded the following results:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|---  class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\"\n|colspan=\"2\" | '''Parties and voter communities'''\n|align=\"center\" | '''%<br />2006'''\n|align=\"center\" | '''Seats<br />2006'''\n|align=\"center\" | '''Seats<br />2016'''\n|----\n|SPD\n|[[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]\n|align=\"right\" |36.7\n|align=\"right\" |14\n|align=\"right\" |12\n|----\n|CDU\n|[[Christian Democratic Union of Germany]]\n|align=\"right\" |27.4\n|align=\"right\" |10\n|align=\"right\" |7\n|----\n|\u00dcWG\n|\u00dcberparteiliche W\u00e4hlergemeinschaft\n|align=\"right\" |22.8\n|align=\"right\" |8\n|align=\"right\" |11\n|----\n|GREENS\n|[[B\u00fcndnis 90/Die Gr\u00fcnen]]\n|align=\"right\" |9.4\n|align=\"right\" |4\n|align=\"right\" |4\n|----\n|FDP\n|[[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]]\n|align=\"right\" |3.7\n|align=\"right\" |1\n|align=\"right\" |3\n|---- class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\"\n|colspan=\"2\" |'''Total'''\n|align=\"right\" |'''100.0'''\n|align=\"right\" |'''37'''\n|align=\"right\" |'''100.0'''\n|align=\"right\" |'''37'''\n|---- class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\"\n|colspan=\"2\" |'''Voter turnout in %'''\n|colspan=\"2\" align=\"right\" |'''49.3'''\n|}\nThe voter turnout in 2016 was 49,7 %.\n\n=== Mayor ===\nThe mayor, Stephan Kelbert, in office since 16 September 2009, was elected on 8 March 2009 with a share of 52.7% in the first round of voting.\n\n=== Town partnerships ===\n*{{flagicon|France}} [[Rumilly, Haute-Savoie|Rumilly]], [[Haute-Savoie]], [[France]]\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Hulst]], [[Zeeuws Vlaanderen]], [[Netherlands]]\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe town's [[Coat of arms|arms]] might be described thus: Per fess azure two mullets Or and Or diapered.\n\nMichelstadt was granted these arms in 1541 along with its new seal by Count Georg of Erbach. The [[diapering]] in the lower half of the [[escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] is unhistoric, and only appeared in the 17th century. Indeed, the escutcheon on the Town Hall, pictured in this article, does not show it. The mullets (six-pointed star shapes) come from the Counts' arms, but why the parting per fess (horizontal division across the middle) was chosen is a mystery. Except for the diapering, the arms have not changed since the 16th century.<ref>[http://www.ngw.nl/int/dld/m/michelst.htm Description and explanation of Michelstadt\u2019s arms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613211242/http://www.ngw.nl/int/dld/m/michelst.htm |date=2007-06-13 }}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n=== Notable companies ===\n* [[M\u00fchlh\u00e4user]], a manufacturer of railbound and trackless tunnel construction equipment\n\n== Arts and culture==\n\n=== Theatre ===\n*''Kleinkunstb\u00fchne Patat'' (cabaret)\n*''Michelst\u00e4dter Theatersommer'', yearly open-air plays in the historic ''Kellereihof''\n*''Theaterkarren e.V.

Lichtigfeld-Museum'' (State Rabbi Lichtigfeld)\n*''Privates Elfenbeinmuseum Ulrich Seidenberg'' (private ivory museum)\n*''Motorrad-Museum'' (motorcycles)\n\n=== Buildings===\nMichelstadt's Old Town features many [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses. Particularly worthy of mention are the following buildings, some within the old town, others in the surrounding countryside: The historic Town Hall, the ''Diebsturm'' (\"Thief's Tower\") at the town wall, the ''Kellereihof'' (a Frankish, early mediaeval castle complex refurbished in an early [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] style) in the town wall ring, the late [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] town church (late 13th century), the ''Einhards-Basilika'', the palace of the Counts at Erbach-F\u00fcrstenau (''Schloss F\u00fcrstenau'', within which are parts of an old [[moat]]ed castle in Michelstadt-Steinbach), ''Jagdschloss Eulbach'' with an [[English landscape garden]] and a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] bath and [[castra]], formerly part of the [[Neckar-Odenwald Limes]].\n\n==== Historic Town Hall ====\n[[Image:Michelstadt Rathaus 2.jpg|right|200px|thumb|<center>Town Hall</center>]]\n[[Image:Michelstadt-Diebsturm.JPG|thumb|200px|''Diebsturm'' at the town wall]]\n\nMichelstadt's timber-frame town hall, whose image was used on a [[Deutsche Post]] [[Postage stamp|stamp]], was built in 1484 in the late Gothic style and later remodelled on the inside many times; from 1743 to 1903 it was covered in [[Shake (shingle)|shakes]]. The town hall's main floor served from the beginning as a market hall, and was built using [[jettying]]. The back (east) wall was originally part of the [[graveyard]] wall, upon which the ground floor's upper bressumer was laid. To this day it is unknown who the master builder was, although it is assumed that the driving force behind the project could have been ''Schenk'' Adolar von Erbach and Bishop Johann von [[Dalberg]] (his adviser).\n\n==== Late Gothic town church ====\nThe town church, completed in 1490, was built to replace a [[Carolingian]] stone church by Einhard, itself built on the site of a former wooden church. The nave's columns and the two aisles' walls were built in 1475. The quire dates from 1461; the antechoir's north wall is even older \u2013 Carolingian. Until the 1970s, the church housed one of the most valuable libraries in Germany in its belltower containing more than a thousand volumes belonging to Michelstadt-born Nicolaus Matz, who was capitular in [[Speyer]], and who bequeathed this collection to his hometown and its citizens in the late 14th century. Since the 1970s the library has been housed in a storehouse specially converted for it at the Michelstadt coaching inn that belonged to the [[Thurn und Taxis]] noble family, who played a key r\u00f4le in [[Europe]]an [[Mail|postal services]] in the 16th century. The former church on this spot was built over a brook that comes up here, called the ''Kiliansflo\u00df'', an early [[Celts|Celtic]]-[[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] worship site and later a Roman [[Mithraic Mysteries|Mithraic]] worship site. The thus channelled ''Kiliansflo\u00df'' fed not only the baptismal font, but also all the town's fountains. The ''Kiliansflo\u00df'', however, does not actually rise here, but rather far outside the town. It then disappears into the ground not far from the graveyard, springing up again in the middle of town.\n\n====Einhard's Basilica in the outlying centre of Steinbach====\n[[Image:Einhardsbasilika bei Michelstadt.jpg|left|250px|thumb|<center>Einhard's Basilica</center>]]\n\nThe ''Einhards-Basilika'' was built by [[Einhard]], Charlemagne's chronicler and confidant. The Carolingian church built between 824 and 827 is one of the very few Carolingian buildings that have survived largely intact. The [[Basilica]]'s [[crypt]] once housed [[Marcellinus and Peter|Saints Peter's and Marcellinus's]] [[relic]]s, which had been stolen from Rome on Einhard's instructions by his notary Ratleik. His servants' nightmares and the remains' \"sweating blood\" there, however, made Einhard think that this arrangement did not feel right. He thus transferred himself, his wife, the relics and his seat to Ober-Mulinheim am Main, now known as [[Seligenstadt]], which thereby became a [[pilgrimage]] site with a new, larger basilica.\n\nThe story that has been handed down says that the relics hidden from Rome were transported to [[Saint-Maurice, Switzerland|Saint-Maurice-en-Valais]], now in [[Switzerland]], whence they were then brought to Michelstadt by a cheering pilgrimage procession.\n\nThe Basilica in Steinbach was converted, expanded, and rededicated many times and later served first as a [[hospital]] and then in the 17th century as a barn. Once it was rediscovered in 1873 as being Carolingian, the exploration and safeguarding of the parts of the basilica that were still intact began.\n\nThe ''Einhards-Basilika'' was until 1967 owned by the princely Counts of Erbach-F\u00fcrstenau. The grounds are now owned by the state of Hesse.\n\n====The palace of the Counts of Erbach-F\u00fcrstenau in the outlying centre of Steinbach ====\n[[Image:Schlossfuerstenau2.jpg|250px|thumb|<center>''Schloss F\u00fcrstenau'' with decorative gateway arch (1588)</center>]]\n[[Image:Schlossfuerstenau1.jpg|right|250px|thumb|<center>New palace (left), ''Schloss F\u00fcrstenau''</center>]]\n\nThe palace complex is a series of building styles which includes remains of the old [[Electorate of Mainz]] border fortifications and moated castle (about 1300) on the north side to the Gothic works by the stonecutters who came from [[Strasbourg]] to Steinbach, to the gigantic Renaissance-style gateway arch (1588) between the moated castle's two western corner towers which replaced the castle wall and opened the gloomy, dank courtyard back up to the former castle garden, to the Renaissance palace mill, a former [[mint (coin)|mint]] (today a [[Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity|run-of-the-river hydroelectric station]]), to the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] ''Kavaliershaus'' (a palace outbuilding for staff and guests) on the M\u00fcmling, to the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] residential wing, the ''Neues Palais'' (1810/11) and the late Baroque [[orangery]] in the palace park, which was built in the English style. The orangery's upper floor housed the small palace theatre.\n\n''Schloss F\u00fcrstenau'' is still a dwelling, with the head of the house of the princely Counts of Erbach-F\u00fcrstenau and his family still living there. The former Electorate of Mainz defence facility lay on the property of the ''Schenk'' of Erbach (a forefather of the noble family, which at that time had not yet branched) and passed into his ownership in 1355. Public access to the ground and is possible by day. At the outer bailey with its gateway arch from 1765 some [[Visual arts|visual artists]] have taken up residence (in among other places the former stables from after 1765).\n\n==== Roman bath and castra ====\nRight near W\u00fcrzberg, in the middle of a clearing are found the remains of the Roman [[Castra|Castrum]] of W\u00fcrzberg, which was built about AD 100 as part of the Neckar-Odenwald-[[Limes (Roman Empire)|Limes]], and was used for about 60 years before the border was shifted farther east. The castrum can only be made out by an earthen wall. The Roman bathhouse, on the other hand, which stands right next to the castrum, has been partially restored; the floors have been replaced and the wall has been built back up to a height of about a metre. Despite the bath's small size, which was only meant for the fort's 120-man garrison, the design of a Roman bathhouse is easily recognizable.\n\nNot far from the outlying centre of Vielbrunn, in the area around the former hunting palace of the [[L\u00f6wenstein-Wertheim|Princes of L\u00f6wenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg]], traces of the Castrum of Hainhaus can still be found. Furthermore, on Michelstadt's eastern outskirts can be found the Castrum of Eulbach near the ''Eulbacher Park'', a landscaped English park from the early 19th century with its hunting palace and an adjoining wildlife park.\n\n==== Other structures ====\n* W\u00fcrzberg Transmission Mast\n* ESOC-Bodenstation Michelstadt (disused satellite ground receiving station)\n\n=== Regular events ===\n*''Michelst\u00e4dter Bienenmarkt'' (\"bee market\") \u2013 Held each year at [[Whitsun]], it was started by former mayor Hasenzahl in 1954.\n*''Musiknacht'' \u2013 Each year, various concert productions take place in the Old Town with many different kinds of music.\n*Church Consecration Festival with ''Weinbrunnenfest'' \u2013 From the Old Town's many fountains, wine is given out by the many wine cellars and businesses at the ''Weinbrunnenfest'' (\"Wine Fountain Festival\"), which is actually Michelstadt's traditional [[folk festival]], at which all the town's countless fountains are decorated.\n*Michelstadt Christmas Market \u2013 this is still quite a new creation of the television-sponsored ''Stadtmarketing'' (\"town marketing\") of the late 1960s. The opening always takes place on the Friday before the onset of [[Advent]]. \n*''Michelst\u00e4dter Theatersommer'' \u2013 since 2003 a yearly open-air theatrical festival, initiated by the Michelstadt \"theatremakers\" Alexander Kaffenberger and Dirk Daniel Zucht.\n\n== Infrastructure==\n=== Transport ===\nIn Michelstadt the two ''[[Bundesstra\u00dfe]]n'' 45 and 47 intersect, both are old trade roads from [[Frankfurt am Main]] to [[Augsburg]] and from [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] to [[W\u00fcrzburg]] respectively.\n\nThe town is served by a [[railway station]] on the [[Odenwald Railway (Hesse)|''Odenwaldbahn'']] (RMV Line 65; [[Eberbach (Baden)|Eberbach]] \u2013 [[Erbach im Odenwald|Erbach]] \u2013 Michelstadt \u2013 [[Darmstadt]] \u2013 Frankfurt / [[Hanau]]). [[Regionalbahn]], Stadtexpress and [[Regionalexpress]] trains of the [[Vias (rail company)|VIAS GmbH]] stop here.\n\nThere is also the special landing facility ''Flugplatz Michelstadt'' (airfield), which lies roughly 2&nbsp;km from the town and is run by a club.\n\n== Education ==\n* ''Stadtschule Michelstadt'' ([[primary school]])\n* ''Schule am Hollerbusch'' (primary school)\n* ''Einhardschule'' (primary school in the outlying centre of Steinbach)\n* ''Grundschule Vielbrunn'' (primary school)\n* ''Theodor-Litt-Schule'' ([[Realschule]] and [[Hauptschule]])\n* ''[[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]] Michelstadt''\n* Odenwaldkreis Vocational Schools (including, among others, [[Education in Germany|Berufsschule, Berufsfachschule and Berufliches Gymnasium]], nowadays known as ''BSO \u2013 Europaschule''.\n\n== Notable people ==\n* [[Sekl Loeb Wormser|Seckel L\u00f6b Wormser]] (b. 1768 in Michelstadt, d. 1847 in Michelstadt), Kabbalist\n* [[Fritz Kredel]] (b. 8 February 1900 in Michelstadt, d. 11 June 1973 in New York)\n* [[Dietrich Schenk von Erbach]] (d. 1459), Archbishop of Mainz (from 1434 to 1459)\n* Bernhard Koziol, founder of the [[:de:Koziol]] plastics company ([[injection moulding]])\n* [[Gabriele von Lutzau]] (b. 1954), sculptor, lives and works in Michelstadt\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|Nicolaus Matz|de}}, rector of the [[University of Freiburg]], capitular in Speyer\n* [[Rebecca Horn]] (b. 1944), artist\n* [[Stefan Seeger]] (b. 1962), chemist, university professor and entrepreneur\n* [[Jessica Schwarz]] (b. 1977), moderator and actress\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Wolfgang Hartmann: ''Zu den fr\u00fchen urkundlichen Erw\u00e4hnungen von Michelstadt im Odenwald.''
