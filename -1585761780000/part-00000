are not enforced due to a lack of resources. Several New York City area nurses have expressed concerns that patients are not complying with self-quarantine guidelines due to financial necessity or fear of losing their jobs. A New York State Nurses Association board member has expressed concerns that low-income patients who share rooms with other individuals may not be able to effectively self-isolate at their residences.<ref>{{cite news|title=NYC nurses fear many coronavirus patients can't afford to self-quarantine|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-nurses-fear-patients-not-self-quarantining-20200324-rd5x2xa3gzc3nhmv3e36u5n3iu-story.html|date=March 24, 2020|work=Daily News}}</ref>\n\n=== Difficulties of implementation in Hasidic communities ===\nImplementing social distancing has been especially difficult in some communities dominated by [[Hasidic Jews]].

Zelenko, who must self-isolate since he is missing a lung, says in daily [[YouTube]] videos he posts that his office has treated 500 patients (mostly in Kiryas Joel) for COVID-19, using the combination of [[hydroxychloroquine]] and [[azithromycin]] or [[zinc sulfate]], which has in some trials yielded positive results in reducing symptoms. Zelenko claimed that 90 percent of the Hasidic community will become infected; the county's health commissioner and the village's emergency services department disputed that, pointing out that it was based on nine positive results out of 14 samples.<ref name=\"Forward article\" />\n\n===Police===\n\nAccording to New York City Police Commissioner [[Dermot F.

are not enforced due to a lack of resources. Several New York City area nurses have expressed concerns that patients are not complying with self-quarantine guidelines due to financial necessity or fear of losing their jobs. A New York State Nurses Association board member has expressed concerns that low-income patients who share rooms with other individuals may not be able to effectively self-isolate at their residences.<ref>{{cite news|title=NYC nurses fear many coronavirus patients can't afford to self-quarantine|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-nurses-fear-patients-not-self-quarantining-20200324-rd5x2xa3gzc3nhmv3e36u5n3iu-story.html|date=March 24, 2020|work=Daily News}}</ref>\n\n=== Difficulties of implementation in Hasidic communities ===\nImplementing social distancing has been especially difficult in some communities dominated by [[Hasidic Jews]].

Zelenko, who must self-isolate since he is missing a lung, says in daily [[YouTube]] videos he posts that his office has treated 500 patients (mostly in Kiryas Joel) for COVID-19, using the combination of [[hydroxychloroquine]] and [[azithromycin]] or [[zinc sulfate]], which has in some trials yielded positive results in reducing symptoms. Zelenko claimed that 90 percent of the Hasidic community will become infected; the county's health commissioner and the village's emergency services department disputed that, pointing out that it was based on nine positive results out of 14 samples.<ref name=\"Forward article\" />\n\n===Police===\n\nAccording to New York City Police Commissioner [[Dermot F.

{"title_page": "Squamish culture", "text_new": "{{SquamishSideBar}}\n'''Squamish culture''' is the customs, arts, music, lifestyle, food, painting and sculpture,  moral systems and social institutions of the [[Squamish people|Squamish]]  [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|indigenous people]], located in the southwestern part of [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. They refer to themselves as ''S\u1e35wx\u0331w\u00fa7mesh'' ({{IPA-sal|sq\u02b7\u03c7\u02b7\u00fa\u0294m\u0259\u0283|}}). They are a part of the [[Coast Salish peoples|Coast Salish]] cultural group.  Their culture and social life is based on the abundant natural resource of the [[Pacific Northwest]] coast, rich in [[Thuja plicata|cedar trees]], [[salmon]], and other resources.  They have complex kinship ties that connect their social life and cultural events to different families and neighboring nations.\n\n== Historical and cultural context ==\nAn important distinction is to be made about S\u1e35wxw\u00fa7mesh culture.  With the [[S\u1e35wxw\u00fa7mesh history|history]] of colonization and assimilation strategies. S\u1e35wxw\u00fa7mesh culture has been drastically changed from their pre-European contact.  Despite these attempts, their culture remains intact and thriving. Some cultural practices and customs are not done in the same fashion, but still occur. These could be things like the construction of cedar bark clothing; modern clothes are worn just like the rest of Canadian society, but the art of cedar bark weaving is still passed on and cedar bark clothing is still made.  It is important to understand that though the practices of the S\u1e35wxw\u00fa7mesh have changed, many still continue, some the same as before, and some only slightly changed.\n\n== Architecture and dwellings ==\n[[File:Indian Village at Coal Harbour.gif|thumb|right|300px|S\u1e35wx\u0331w\u00fa7mesh longhouses once located in 1886 at [[Coal Harbour]].]]There architecture in traditional homes is similar to Coast Salish style dwellings called a \"longhouse.\"  The housing structures are made from cedar planks, posts, and ties.  Historically extended families would live in a longhouse, with different branches of the kinship living in different quarters of the house.  Larger houses would have been built to accommodate and host large amounts of guests in ceremonies, festivals, or [[potlatch]]ing.  Typical sizes would be around 30 feet wide, 40 feet long and from 19\u201313 feet high.\n\nThe house posts on one side would stand slightly taller than the other, giving the roof a small pitch or shed look.  Within the house, these house posts would be carved into figures of ancestors depicting legendary events or other family history such as family rights in fishing, hunting, or gathering. Beams crossed the house posts, where wood planks would sit to create the roof.  Within the house, wooden platforms formed along the walls holding families living and sleeping quarters.  With this architectural style, houses could be built onto each other end to end extending the length of the longhouse.  This gave rise to the term \u2018\u2019longhouse\u2019\u2019.<ref>Stewart, Hilary. \u2018\u2019Cedar\u2019\u2019, Douglas & McIntyre Ltd & University of Washington Press, 1984. p65 {{ISBN|0-88894-437-3}}.</ref>\n\nDifferent types of homes once existed in a typical village, depending on size.  Some villages houses a few or handful of houses, where others operated with dozens of houses, all homes to many different families.  The larger longhouses were used for large potlatches or gatherings, and other longhouses were used exclusively for spiritual ceremonialism.  These are Potlatch Houses or ''tl'e7en<u>k</u>\u00e1\u1e83txw''.<ref name=\"Kolstee, Anton 1993. p98\">Kolstee, Anton. The Eagle School student dictionary of Squamish language.

The architectural style has also been incorporated into modern buildings in the communities.\n\n==Clothing==\nThe furs of animals such as marmots, mink, weasels, and squirrels, were used for clothing. Why is my butt cracked?\n\n== Ceremonies and events ==\nIn S\u1e35wx\u0331w\u00fa7mesh culture, ceremonies, events and festivals were the highly of community life.  Ranging from community gathers in feasts, to spiritual endeavours in ceremony, these events were a big part of the culture.  The most studied and practiced event was the potlatch.  It is important to note that a S\u1e35w<u>x</u>w\u00fa7mesh potlatch differed quite differently from the Northern tribes and their festivities.  In a S\u1e35w<u>x</u>w\u00fa7mesh potlatch, a large feast is held and the community, nation, or neighboring nations are invited to partake.  Highly wealthy families and individuals host these potlatch for different events taking place, and to distribute the resources and wealth accumulated.  A [[potlatch]] would usually occur around events such as birth, coming of age, naming ceremony, marriage, or memorial event for the deceased.  It is in the winter months that most potlatching take places, where historically summer was used for traveling and harvesting.\n\n=== Potlatch ===\n{{main|Potlatch}}\nAt a potlatch, in their language a ''tl'e7en<u>k</u>'', the host would invite guests to feast in foods prepared and harvested.  Blankets would be bought or made, then distributed to guests.  At the events, the host would hire a speaker to speak for the family in the proceedings.  For special potlatches, a special platform would be constructed, around 10 or 15 feet high, 5 feet wide, where the host and his speaker would pile a number of blankets, either bought or made by the hosts own family, and distribute the blankets to the guest.  The speaker would call out names of guests, usually highly respected or high ranking, taking a blanket and throwing it out for that guest.  Typically a crowd would amass below, ready for the falling blankets, waiting for it to fall.  While the blanket came down, the other guests would have knives and spears ready to tear apart the blanket.  Thus, the blanket would be torn and split up into multiple pieces.  After attended a few potlatches, the guests would procure enough wool to construct their own blanket.{{sfn|Matthews|1955|pp=190, 266, 267}} \"Hundred Dollar Charlie,\" maternal grandfather to [[Andy Paull]], reportedly gave the last potlatch on [[Burrard Inlet]] before it was banned by the Canadian government in 1885.\n\nIn other ceremonies, a young woman, sometimes the daughter of a highly respected man, would be placed on top of a mound of blankets.  This mound would match her height.  Sitting on top of the blankets, a ceremony would take place around here, while she sat on top of and her family nearby.  During some ceremonies, people situated around the house would take wooden batons and beat on plank drums situated through the house.  When a young girl would stand up, she would dance around the house with a shawl on, and everyone else would beat and sing.  When she was done, one man would take [[Down feather|down]], from [[duck]], [[swan]], or [[eagle]], and sprinkle it over her.{{sfn|Matthews|1955|pp=266, 267}}\n\nFor large festivities, a bigger house then the normal dwelling would be built. These are potlatch houses or ''tl'e7en<u>k</u>\u00e1\u1e83txw''.<ref name=\"Kolstee, Anton 1993. p98\"/>  One longhouse was measured at 200 feet long by 60 feet wide.<ref name=\"Barman, Jean 2005. p46\"/> These houses could hold over a thousand guests, invited from far along the coast.  The house would be decorated with down, sprinkled throughout the floor of the house.{{sfn|Matthews|1955|p=267}}  The longhouse in [[Xwemelch'stn]] is one of these types of houses.  One potlatch was recorded at [[Xw\u00e1\u00fdxway|<u>X</u>w\u00e1\u00fd<u>x</u>way]] in 1875.  In the longhouse, a large cedar slab dwelling, a large ceremony with guests of people from nearby nations, [[Vancouver Island]], and the Interior British Columbia.  This potlatch was hosted by [[August Jack]]'s father, named Supple Jack.<ref name=\"Barman, Jean 2005. p43\"/>\n\n=== Puberty and rites of passage ===\nThe stage of life that brought much change was filled with much attention and celebration.  Young men and women may follow some of the same customs, but differ on certain specifics.  The difference in their training had to do with what positions they would be taking in the community, the fact that different families had different protocols, or other factors.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p37\">Hill-Tout, Charles. ''The Salish People Volume II: The Squamish and Lillooet''. Talon Books, December 1978. p37. {{ISBN|0-88922-151-0}}</ref>\n\nAt the sign of reaching this point in a young girl's life, she would inform her mother, and she would inform the father.  The father would call together the family and relatives.  They would then discuss what arrangements and course they would follow.  Different families had different teachings or traditions, and as such, each girl may have had different customs. In one example of the tradition, the family would take two strands of mountain goat wool, and tie them to each side of the girl's forehead.  The community would see this signifier of her new womanhood, announcing to her people that she is of age.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p37\"/>\n\nFor four days, she would fast with no food and limited or no water.  During this time, she would refrain from bathing and being near fires.  It was believed if she was to go near the fire, her skin would become red.  The women of her family, like her mother, grandmother or other women, would pull out the irregular hairs from the edges of her eyebrows to make them fine and beautiful.  The edges were rubbed with the girl's saliva and a plant mixture to stop hairs from growing again.  After the four days, the same woman would bathe and scrub her.\n\nThe purpose of these traditions were to make her \"bright and smart\".<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p37\"/>   Following the bathing, she would be given food and could then sit near the fire.  When applicable, a family member would drape a blanket over the woman's shoulders.  After the meal, she would be painted with red ochre.  She would travel to the forest and pull down cedar and spruce tree branches, rubbing the ends of these over her face and body.  This would to make her beautiful and charming in the eyes of men.  She would give offerings of fern roots to those cedar trees.\n\nAfter all these things were conducted, she would be given an ancestral name, and the naming ceremony or potlatch would occur.\n\n=== Naming ===\nNaming customs are ancestral or hereditary naming.  Within the traditional customs, when a child is born the elders of the child's family or community would choose a name.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p42\">Hill-Tout, Charles. ''The Salish People Volume II: The Squamish and Lillooet''. Talon Books, December 1978. p42 {{ISBN|0-88922-151-0}}</ref>  This is called a ''ninamin'' or ''nicknam'' used to name children.  Years later while going through puberty or \"coming-of-age\" rituals, the person would receive a name from a deceased ancestor.  These ancestral names can then be traced back many generations.  The names are thus considered \"property\", in belonging to a family.  These ancestral names are called \"kweshamin\".  The family would host a potlatch and bestow the new ancestral name on the person.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p42\"/> Within present practices, ancestral names are still passed on, but mostly when a family makes the preparations to host a potlatch and not just when a child begins puberty.\n\nEvery name has a suffix ending, denoting masculine or feminine names, and sometimes having actual translations to their meaning.  One example is the ''-lanexw'' ending.  This is found in names like \"Kiyapalanexw\" which when Anglicized became \"Capilano\", \"Xatsalanxw\" which when Anglicized became \"Kitsilano\", and many other names.\n\n=== Marriage ===\nAfter a young boy or girl went through the proper \"coming-of-age\" rituals, or had reached puberty, they were ready to become adults.  For young people around this age, marriage would be a priority.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p40\">Hill-Tout, Charles. ''The Salish People Volume II: The Squamish and Lillooet''. Talon Books, December 1978. p40. {{ISBN|0-88922-151-0}}</ref>  A young man would search out a prospective bride from another village or sometimes a neighboring nation.  He would travel to the house of the prospective bride, sit outside the doorway with a blanket wrapped around him, and wait.  He would wait here, not eating any foods or eating any liquids during this time, usually lasting up to 4 days.  While this occurred, the girl's family would take no notice of him.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p40\"/>  If acceptable to the parents, the mother of the prospective wife would approach a neighbor to inform the young man that the girl's parents are willing to accept him as their son-in-law.\n\nNeither the girl's family nor the young lover would have any communication with each other.  The neighbor would prepare and give a meal to the fasting lover.  He would then return home to his village and family to inform them of his acceptance.  He would return days later with family and friends in canoes.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p40\"/>  If of lower ranking, he would return with one canoe load of blankets, but if of higher ranking, he would come with many canoe loads of gifts, blankets, and animal skins.  All of these gifts would be distributed to the bride's family.  Sometimes, the young man was not accepted by the young woman's family.  A family council would be held to discuss the issue, and the young man might be rejected.  A neighbor would be called upon to be an intermediary and inform him he is not invited into the house and to return home.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p41\">Hill-Tout, Charles. ''The Salish People Volume II: The Squamish and Lillooet''. Talon Books, December 1978. p41. {{ISBN|0-88922-151-0}}</ref>\n\nDuring the night, the father-in-law would entertain the groom's family, and offer accommodation to them, with the host family sleeping on one side of the longhouse, and the groom's family living on the other.  In the proceeding morning, both families would walk down to the beach front where the groom's canoe is moored.  Here the bride's family placed blankets in the canoe.  If the bride was of high rank or nobility, blankets would be lined up on the ground from the house to the canoe for the bride to walk on, while two older women led her down.  The bride would be dressed in beautiful regalia in colours and ornaments.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p40\"/>  Over her head another blanket was placed, somewhat like a veil.  Behind her would be carried personal belongings, such as things like mats, baskets, blankets, wooden platters, and spoons.\n\nThe older women then placed the bride on the bow of the canoe, and for their services the groom thanked them with gifts or blankets.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p41\"/>  The bride's family and friends then returned to their home, while the young groom and his family returned to his village with the bride.  If the family were not of nobility, most of these customs would not occur.\n\nAfter some days, the bride and groom would return to the woman's village with the father-of-the-bride hosting a feast for his guests.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p40\"/>  After this feast, the married couple and family returned to their home. Many days later, the bride's family traveled to the groom's village. They would bring gifts and blankets equal the number given to them. They distributed this all to the groom's friends and family, and celebrated with a large potlatch.  During the potlatch, the bride would be placed on top of many blankets piled high, and would sit there during the ceremonies and speeches.  Gifts would be given away, and the family and village would celebrate.  After all these, the marriage ceremonies would end and the man and woman were regarded as husband and wife.\n\n== Games and sports ==\nS\u1e35wxw\u00fa7mesh daily life included an array of games and sports.  One of the most well known games played was the bone game or [[slahal]]. This was played with two opposing teams. There were two sets of \"bones\", and two sets of sticks, numbering from 7-11 for each team. When a game was in play, one team had two sets of \"bones\". When your team was guessing, your objective was to get the right bone, the one without the stripe. When you had the bones, your objective was to make sure the other team guessed wrong on the bones set. When the other team guessed wrong, you gained a point. When a team had the two sets of bones, two individuals hid the bones and swapped them around from hand to hand. Eventually the bones were brought forward, but were concealed as to show the other team which one had a stripe on it. The game was usually accompanied by drumming and singing, used to boost the morale of the team. The side that had the bone sings, while the other tried to guess. Musical accompaniment was also sometimes used to taunt the other team. Gambling could be done by players, or spectators of a match. Placing bets on teams, or individual matches within the game between one guess and the other teams bone hiders.\n\nOther games included some played by children, and some played specifically by the warriors to prepare and train themselves.  Some sports are similar to modern-day lacrosse, rugby, and soccer.\n\nThe S\u1e35wxw\u00fa7mesh game called {{not a typo|t<u>k</u>'7kw'ala}}, similar to lacrosse, was played in villages.  A smooth oval stone weighing about three pounds, would be used by teams of two, around six on each team.  There were no sticks or nets on open spaces.  The goal posts were six feet apart on each side of an open space.\n\nIn the last few decades, canoe racing has become popular among [[Coast Salish peoples]].  It's done with specifically designed war canoes or racing canoes.  They are based on the more traditional canoe styles, but have quite a modern design.  The canoe is usually a foot or two above water level, with enough width for one man.  Different races include single, double, or 11-man races.  The races are held in the summertime.\n\n== Language ==\n{{Main|Squamish language}}\nThe [[Squamish language]], or S\u1e35w<u>x</u>w\u00fa7mesh language, is the ancestral language of the S\u1e35wx\u0331w\u00fa7mesh people.  It is considered an important part of cultural revitalization.  Although nearing [[language extinction]], it's still used in ceremonies, events, and basic conversation among some.  With the language dead (no children are learning it as a first language and all language speakers are over the age of 65), much work is being done to preserve and revitalize it.  The language is part the [[Coast Salish]] linguistic group, and is most closely related to [[Sh\u00e1sh\u00edsh\u00e1lh language|Sh\u00e1sh\u00edsh\u00e1lh]] (Sechelt), and S\u1e35'emin'em ([[Halkomelem language|Halkomelem]]) and Xwsa7km ([[Nooksack language|Lh\u00e9chalosem]]).  Many anthropologists and linguists have worked with S\u1e35w<u>x</u>w\u00fa7mesh people and their language, including [[Franz Boas]], [[Charles Hill-Tout]], [[Homer Barnett]], and [[Aert J. Kuipers]].\n\nSince the late 1800s the language has had a history.  Before contact, it was the prominent language of all the villages, along with the [[Chinook Jargon]].  Most children would learn Chinook as a first language because it was so basic, then S\u1e35wxw\u00fa7mesh language as they became older.  After the spread of diseases causing massive population drops and colonizations of their territory, Chinook became a minority language in their lands.  When the Canadian government enforced [[assimilationist]] policies regarding their culture and language, a [[Canadian Indian residential school system|residential school]] was set up in the village of [[Eslha7an]] with children coming from many Skwxwu7mesh villages, plus some church officials sending children to another school in [[Sechelt]].  The school, a home for many children 10 months out of the year, were forbade to speak their language.  Any children speaking the language were punished and beaten.  This cause a deep resentment about speaking the language, and so the next generation grew up without any knowledge of their native tongue.\n\nOver the years, English became the prominent language.  Then during the 1960s, a great deal of documentation and work helped in its revitalization.  The BC Language Project with Randy Bouchard and Dorothy Kennedy undertook more documentation and were the main collaborators on this project. They devised the present writing system that is used for the S\u1e35w<u>x</u>w\u00fa7mesh language.  Eventually a local [[elementary school]] and [[high school]] included language classes, as opposed to the normal [[French language]] option.   Xwemelch'stn Estimxwataxw School, meaning ''Xwmelch'stn Littleones School'', with grades Kindergarten to 3, was built to assist in [[language immersion]], with plans to expand it into a full immersion school.<ref>Lancaster, Deanna.

Smaller inlet-style canoes were used in calmer waters and shorter travel to nearby villages or neighboring people. Cargo canoes were also made for trading large amounts of goods.  The main way or transportation was through canoe pulling.

The architectural style has also been incorporated into modern buildings in the communities.\n\n==Clothing==\nThe furs of animals such as marmots, mink, weasels, and squirrels, were used for clothing.\n\n== Ceremonies and events ==\nIn S\u1e35wx\u0331w\u00fa7mesh culture, ceremonies, events and festivals were the highly of community life.  Ranging from community gathers in feasts, to spiritual endeavours in ceremony, these events were a big part of the culture.  The most studied and practiced event was the potlatch.  It is important to note that a S\u1e35w<u>x</u>w\u00fa7mesh potlatch differed quite differently from the Northern tribes and their festivities.  In a S\u1e35w<u>x</u>w\u00fa7mesh potlatch, a large feast is held and the community, nation, or neighboring nations are invited to partake.  Highly wealthy families and individuals host these potlatch for different events taking place, and to distribute the resources and wealth accumulated.  A [[potlatch]] would usually occur around events such as birth, coming of age, naming ceremony, marriage, or memorial event for the deceased.  It is in the winter months that most potlatching take places, where historically summer was used for traveling and harvesting.\n\n=== Potlatch ===\n{{main|Potlatch}}\nAt a potlatch, in their language a ''tl'e7en<u>k</u>'', the host would invite guests to feast in foods prepared and harvested.  Blankets would be bought or made, then distributed to guests.  At the events, the host would hire a speaker to speak for the family in the proceedings.  For special potlatches, a special platform would be constructed, around 10 or 15 feet high, 5 feet wide, where the host and his speaker would pile a number of blankets, either bought or made by the hosts own family, and distribute the blankets to the guest.  The speaker would call out names of guests, usually highly respected or high ranking, taking a blanket and throwing it out for that guest.  Typically a crowd would amass below, ready for the falling blankets, waiting for it to fall.  While the blanket came down, the other guests would have knives and spears ready to tear apart the blanket.  Thus, the blanket would be torn and split up into multiple pieces.  After attended a few potlatches, the guests would procure enough wool to construct their own blanket.{{sfn|Matthews|1955|pp=190, 266, 267}} \"Hundred Dollar Charlie,\" maternal grandfather to [[Andy Paull]], reportedly gave the last potlatch on [[Burrard Inlet]] before it was banned by the Canadian government in 1885.\n\nIn other ceremonies, a young woman, sometimes the daughter of a highly respected man, would be placed on top of a mound of blankets.  This mound would match her height.  Sitting on top of the blankets, a ceremony would take place around here, while she sat on top of and her family nearby.  During some ceremonies, people situated around the house would take wooden batons and beat on plank drums situated through the house.  When a young girl would stand up, she would dance around the house with a shawl on, and everyone else would beat and sing.  When she was done, one man would take [[Down feather|down]], from [[duck]], [[swan]], or [[eagle]], and sprinkle it over her.{{sfn|Matthews|1955|pp=266, 267}}\n\nFor large festivities, a bigger house then the normal dwelling would be built. These are potlatch houses or ''tl'e7en<u>k</u>\u00e1\u1e83txw''.<ref name=\"Kolstee, Anton 1993. p98\"/>  One longhouse was measured at 200 feet long by 60 feet wide.<ref name=\"Barman, Jean 2005. p46\"/> These houses could hold over a thousand guests, invited from far along the coast.  The house would be decorated with down, sprinkled throughout the floor of the house.{{sfn|Matthews|1955|p=267}}  The longhouse in [[Xwemelch'stn]] is one of these types of houses.  One potlatch was recorded at [[Xw\u00e1\u00fdxway|<u>X</u>w\u00e1\u00fd<u>x</u>way]] in 1875.  In the longhouse, a large cedar slab dwelling, a large ceremony with guests of people from nearby nations, [[Vancouver Island]], and the Interior British Columbia.  This potlatch was hosted by [[August Jack]]'s father, named Supple Jack.<ref name=\"Barman, Jean 2005. p43\"/>\n\n=== Puberty and rites of passage ===\nThe stage of life that brought much change was filled with much attention and celebration.  Young men and women may follow some of the same customs, but differ on certain specifics.  The difference in their training had to do with what positions they would be taking in the community, the fact that different families had different protocols, or other factors.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p37\">Hill-Tout, Charles. ''The Salish People Volume II: The Squamish and Lillooet''. Talon Books, December 1978. p37. {{ISBN|0-88922-151-0}}</ref>\n\nAt the sign of reaching this point in a young girl's life, she would inform her mother, and she would inform the father.  The father would call together the family and relatives.  They would then discuss what arrangements and course they would follow.  Different families had different teachings or traditions, and as such, each girl may have had different customs. In one example of the tradition, the family would take two strands of mountain goat wool, and tie them to each side of the girl's forehead.  The community would see this signifier of her new womanhood, announcing to her people that she is of age.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p37\"/>\n\nFor four days, she would fast with no food and limited or no water.  During this time, she would refrain from bathing and being near fires.  It was believed if she was to go near the fire, her skin would become red.  The women of her family, like her mother, grandmother or other women, would pull out the irregular hairs from the edges of her eyebrows to make them fine and beautiful.  The edges were rubbed with the girl's saliva and a plant mixture to stop hairs from growing again.  After the four days, the same woman would bathe and scrub her.\n\nThe purpose of these traditions were to make her \"bright and smart\".<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p37\"/>   Following the bathing, she would be given food and could then sit near the fire.  When applicable, a family member would drape a blanket over the woman's shoulders.  After the meal, she would be painted with red ochre.  She would travel to the forest and pull down cedar and spruce tree branches, rubbing the ends of these over her face and body.  This would to make her beautiful and charming in the eyes of men.  She would give offerings of fern roots to those cedar trees.\n\nAfter all these things were conducted, she would be given an ancestral name, and the naming ceremony or potlatch would occur.\n\n=== Naming ===\nNaming customs are ancestral or hereditary naming.  Within the traditional customs, when a child is born the elders of the child's family or community would choose a name.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p42\">Hill-Tout, Charles. ''The Salish People Volume II: The Squamish and Lillooet''. Talon Books, December 1978. p42 {{ISBN|0-88922-151-0}}</ref>  This is called a ''ninamin'' or ''nicknam'' used to name children.  Years later while going through puberty or \"coming-of-age\" rituals, the person would receive a name from a deceased ancestor.  These ancestral names can then be traced back many generations.  The names are thus considered \"property\", in belonging to a family.  These ancestral names are called \"kweshamin\".  The family would host a potlatch and bestow the new ancestral name on the person.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p42\"/> Within present practices, ancestral names are still passed on, but mostly when a family makes the preparations to host a potlatch and not just when a child begins puberty.\n\nEvery name has a suffix ending, denoting masculine or feminine names, and sometimes having actual translations to their meaning.  One example is the ''-lanexw'' ending.  This is found in names like \"Kiyapalanexw\" which when Anglicized became \"Capilano\", \"Xatsalanxw\" which when Anglicized became \"Kitsilano\", and many other names.\n\n=== Marriage ===\nAfter a young boy or girl went through the proper \"coming-of-age\" rituals, or had reached puberty, they were ready to become adults.  For young people around this age, marriage would be a priority.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p40\">Hill-Tout, Charles. ''The Salish People Volume II: The Squamish and Lillooet''. Talon Books, December 1978. p40. {{ISBN|0-88922-151-0}}</ref>  A young man would search out a prospective bride from another village or sometimes a neighboring nation.  He would travel to the house of the prospective bride, sit outside the doorway with a blanket wrapped around him, and wait.  He would wait here, not eating any foods or eating any liquids during this time, usually lasting up to 4 days.  While this occurred, the girl's family would take no notice of him.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p40\"/>  If acceptable to the parents, the mother of the prospective wife would approach a neighbor to inform the young man that the girl's parents are willing to accept him as their son-in-law.\n\nNeither the girl's family nor the young lover would have any communication with each other.  The neighbor would prepare and give a meal to the fasting lover.  He would then return home to his village and family to inform them of his acceptance.  He would return days later with family and friends in canoes.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p40\"/>  If of lower ranking, he would return with one canoe load of blankets, but if of higher ranking, he would come with many canoe loads of gifts, blankets, and animal skins.  All of these gifts would be distributed to the bride's family.  Sometimes, the young man was not accepted by the young woman's family.  A family council would be held to discuss the issue, and the young man might be rejected.  A neighbor would be called upon to be an intermediary and inform him he is not invited into the house and to return home.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p41\">Hill-Tout, Charles. ''The Salish People Volume II: The Squamish and Lillooet''. Talon Books, December 1978. p41. {{ISBN|0-88922-151-0}}</ref>\n\nDuring the night, the father-in-law would entertain the groom's family, and offer accommodation to them, with the host family sleeping on one side of the longhouse, and the groom's family living on the other.  In the proceeding morning, both families would walk down to the beach front where the groom's canoe is moored.  Here the bride's family placed blankets in the canoe.  If the bride was of high rank or nobility, blankets would be lined up on the ground from the house to the canoe for the bride to walk on, while two older women led her down.  The bride would be dressed in beautiful regalia in colours and ornaments.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p40\"/>  Over her head another blanket was placed, somewhat like a veil.  Behind her would be carried personal belongings, such as things like mats, baskets, blankets, wooden platters, and spoons.\n\nThe older women then placed the bride on the bow of the canoe, and for their services the groom thanked them with gifts or blankets.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p41\"/>  The bride's family and friends then returned to their home, while the young groom and his family returned to his village with the bride.  If the family were not of nobility, most of these customs would not occur.\n\nAfter some days, the bride and groom would return to the woman's village with the father-of-the-bride hosting a feast for his guests.<ref name=\"Hill-Tout, Charles 1978. p40\"/>  After this feast, the married couple and family returned to their home. Many days later, the bride's family traveled to the groom's village. They would bring gifts and blankets equal the number given to them. They distributed this all to the groom's friends and family, and celebrated with a large potlatch.  During the potlatch, the bride would be placed on top of many blankets piled high, and would sit there during the ceremonies and speeches.  Gifts would be given away, and the family and village would celebrate.  After all these, the marriage ceremonies would end and the man and woman were regarded as husband and wife.\n\n== Games and sports ==\nS\u1e35wxw\u00fa7mesh daily life included an array of games and sports.  One of the most well known games played was the bone game or [[slahal]]. This was played with two opposing teams. There were two sets of \"bones\", and two sets of sticks, numbering from 7-11 for each team. When a game was in play, one team had two sets of \"bones\". When your team was guessing, your objective was to get the right bone, the one without the stripe. When you had the bones, your objective was to make sure the other team guessed wrong on the bones set. When the other team guessed wrong, you gained a point. When a team had the two sets of bones, two individuals hid the bones and swapped them around from hand to hand. Eventually the bones were brought forward, but were concealed as to show the other team which one had a stripe on it. The game was usually accompanied by drumming and singing, used to boost the morale of the team. The side that had the bone sings, while the other tried to guess. Musical accompaniment was also sometimes used to taunt the other team. Gambling could be done by players, or spectators of a match. Placing bets on teams, or individual matches within the game between one guess and the other teams bone hiders.\n\nOther games included some played by children, and some played specifically by the warriors to prepare and train themselves.  Some sports are similar to modern-day lacrosse, rugby, and soccer.\n\nThe S\u1e35wxw\u00fa7mesh game called {{not a typo|t<u>k</u>'7kw'ala}}, similar to lacrosse, was played in villages.  A smooth oval stone weighing about three pounds, would be used by teams of two, around six on each team.  There were no sticks or nets on open spaces.  The goal posts were six feet apart on each side of an open space.\n\nIn the last few decades, canoe racing has become popular among [[Coast Salish peoples]].  It's done with specifically designed war canoes or racing canoes.  They are based on the more traditional canoe styles, but have quite a modern design.  The canoe is usually a foot or two above water level, with enough width for one man.  Different races include single, double, or 11-man races.  The races are held in the summertime.\n\n== Language ==\n{{Main|Squamish language}}\nThe [[Squamish language]], or S\u1e35w<u>x</u>w\u00fa7mesh language, is the ancestral language of the S\u1e35wx\u0331w\u00fa7mesh people.  It is considered an important part of cultural revitalization.  Although nearing [[language extinction]], it's still used in ceremonies, events, and basic conversation among some.  With the language dead (no children are learning it as a first language and all language speakers are over the age of 65), much work is being done to preserve and revitalize it.  The language is part the [[Coast Salish]] linguistic group, and is most closely related to [[Sh\u00e1sh\u00edsh\u00e1lh language|Sh\u00e1sh\u00edsh\u00e1lh]] (Sechelt), and S\u1e35'emin'em ([[Halkomelem language|Halkomelem]]) and Xwsa7km ([[Nooksack language|Lh\u00e9chalosem]]).  Many anthropologists and linguists have worked with S\u1e35w<u>x</u>w\u00fa7mesh people and their language, including [[Franz Boas]], [[Charles Hill-Tout]], [[Homer Barnett]], and [[Aert J. Kuipers]].\n\nSince the late 1800s the language has had a history.  Before contact, it was the prominent language of all the villages, along with the [[Chinook Jargon]].  Most children would learn Chinook as a first language because it was so basic, then S\u1e35wxw\u00fa7mesh language as they became older.  After the spread of diseases causing massive population drops and colonizations of their territory, Chinook became a minority language in their lands.  When the Canadian government enforced [[assimilationist]] policies regarding their culture and language, a [[Canadian Indian residential school system|residential school]] was set up in the village of [[Eslha7an]] with children coming from many Skwxwu7mesh villages, plus some church officials sending children to another school in [[Sechelt]].  The school, a home for many children 10 months out of the year, were forbade to speak their language.  Any children speaking the language were punished and beaten.  This cause a deep resentment about speaking the language, and so the next generation grew up without any knowledge of their native tongue.\n\nOver the years, English became the prominent language.  Then during the 1960s, a great deal of documentation and work helped in its revitalization.  The BC Language Project with Randy Bouchard and Dorothy Kennedy undertook more documentation and were the main collaborators on this project. They devised the present writing system that is used for the S\u1e35w<u>x</u>w\u00fa7mesh language.  Eventually a local [[elementary school]] and [[high school]] included language classes, as opposed to the normal [[French language]] option.   Xwemelch'stn Estimxwataxw School, meaning ''Xwmelch'stn Littleones School'', with grades Kindergarten to 3, was built to assist in [[language immersion]], with plans to expand it into a full immersion school.<ref>Lancaster, Deanna.

Kennedy's wife, [[Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy|Carolyn Bessette]], and sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette, were also on board and died. The single-engine [[Piper Saratoga]] had departed from New Jersey's [[Essex County Airport]], and its intended route was along the coastline of [[Connecticut]] and across [[Rhode Island Sound]] to [[Martha's Vineyard Airport]].\n\nThe official investigation by the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) concluded that Kennedy fell victim to [[spatial disorientation]] while he was descending over water at night and consequently lost control of his plane. Kennedy did not hold an [[instrument rating]] and therefore he was only certified to fly under [[visual flight rules]].

MA}}</ref>\n\n==Investigation==\nThe [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) officially declared that Kennedy's plane had crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Martha's Vineyard. The probable cause of the crash was \"the pilot's failure to maintain control of the airplane during a descent over water at night, which was a result of spatial disorientation\".<ref name=NTSB.Factual /> Kennedy was not qualified to fly his plane by \"instruments only\". The crash occurred in conditions not legally requiring such qualification. Other pilots flying similar routes on the night of the crash reported no visual horizon due to [[haze]].<ref name=NTSB.Factual/>\n\n=== Possible contributing factors ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=July 2012}}\n'''Haze and visibility'''\n\nAtmospheric conditions along Kennedy's flight path on the night of the crash were occasionally hazy, which can lead to [[spatial disorientation]] for pilots. The weather was officially listed as \"[[visual meteorological conditions]]\" (VMC), which allowed Kennedy to fly under [[Visual Flight Rules]] (VFR) rather than [[Instrument Flight Rules]] (IFR), despite the fact he lacked an [[instrument rating]]. The visibility was very poor in Essex County, New Jersey and airports along Kennedy's flight path reported visibility between 5 and 8 miles with haze and a few clouds. Some pilots flying similar routes as Kennedy on the night of the accident reported no [[Visual flight|visual horizon]] over water because of haze. Also, the NTSB reported on one pilot who cancelled a similar flight that evening due to \"poor\" weather. The conditions near the crash site were: \"Clear skies at or below 12,000 feet; visibility 10 miles\".<ref name=NTSB.Factual/>\n\n'''Pilot experience'''\n\nKennedy first obtained his [[Private Pilot License|private pilot license]] in 1998 and received \"high performance airplane\" and \"[[complex airplane]]\" endorsements two months before the crash.<ref name=NTSB.Factual/> His estimated total flight experience before the crash was about 310 hours, of which 55 hours were at night. His estimated flight time in the accident airplane was about 36 hours, of which about nine hours were at night. About three hours of that flight time were without a [[Certified Flight Instructor]] (CFI) on board, and only 48 minutes of that time was flown at night, which included a night landing.<ref name=NTSB.Factual/>\n\nIt's not clear how much of his total flight experience was in the plane type that crashed or in Kennedy's other more basic plane, the [[Cessna Skylane|Cessna Skylane 182]]. Fifteen months before the crash, Kennedy had flown about 35 flights either to or from northern New Jersey and the Martha's Vineyard area. Kennedy flew more than 17 of these legs without a CFI on board, including at least five at night. His last known flight in his airplane without a CFI on board happened two months before the crash.<ref name=NTSB.Factual/>\n\n'''Pilot training'''\n\nThe CFI who prepared Kennedy for his private pilot checkride stated that he had \"very good\" flying skills for his level of experience.<ref name=\"Salon.com\">{{cite web|title=JFK Jr.: The truth behind the crash|url=https://www.salon.com/2000/07/07/kennedy_13/|website=Salon, July 7, 2000|publisher=Salon.com}}</ref> Four months before the crash, Kennedy passed the FAA's written airplane instrument examination and later enrolled in an instrument rating course. He continued to receive flight instruction in New Jersey in his plane, including flights from CDW to MVY. His instructors said Kennedy required help working the [[rudder]] pedals to taxi and land the plane because of his ankle injury.<ref name=\"Salon.com\"/>\n\nDuring a training flight at night under [[Instrument meteorological conditions|instrument conditions]], his instructor stated that Kennedy had the ability to fly the airplane without a visible horizon but may have experienced difficulty performing additional tasks under such conditions. He also stated that the pilot was not ready for an instrument evaluation and needed additional training. The instructor at the time of the crash was not aware that Kennedy would be flying in those conditions without an instructor on board. The CFI further stated that he had talked to Kennedy on the night of the accident and offered to fly with him that night. He stated that Kennedy had the capability to conduct a night flight to Martha's Vineyard as long as a visible horizon existed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Safety Board Blames Pilot Error in Crash of Kennedy Plane|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/07/nyregion/safety-board-blames-pilot-error-in-crash-of-kennedy-plane.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 7, 2000}}</ref>\n\n'''Psychological stress'''\n\nThe NTSB suggested that Kennedy's marriage may have contributed to a source of stress by the time of the crash.<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,90819,00.html Book Details John F.

Distractions can so interfere with judgment that unwarranted risks are taken, such as flying into deteriorating weather conditions to keep on schedule.\"\n\n====Pilot distraction====\n\nFrom 8:49&nbsp;p.m., about 10 minutes after departure, and for a 5 minute period lasting until 8:54&nbsp;p.m., Kennedy's plane flew in the same vicinity as [[American Airlines]] Flight 1484, a [[Fokker 100]], which was on approach to [[Westchester County Airport]] (HPN).<ref name=NTSB.Factual/> The [[Traffic collision avoidance system]] (TCAS) sounded on the Fokker 100, leading to some discussion between the Fokker and the New York approach controller (ATC). However, the interaction ended with American Airlines Flight 1484 reporting to ATC that they believe the other plane was a Piper and that the TCAS warning was resolved. No corrective action was reported to have been taken by ATC nor American Airlines Flight 1484.<ref name=NTSB.Factual/> It's not known if Kennedy was aware of, or distracted by, the incident.\n\n====Late departure====\n\nThe flight was originally scheduled for daylight hours but had to be postponed after Kennedy's sister-in-law was delayed at work. Heavy traffic further delayed Kennedy's flight and pushed it back until after dark. Originally planned to depart at 6:00&nbsp;p.m., Kennedy's plane departed at 8:39&nbsp;p.m. instead, nearly a half-hour past sunset. At the time of the takeoff, the moon was just above the horizon and provided very little illumination.\n\n====No flight plan or request for help====\n\nKennedy never received a weather briefing or filed a [[flight plan]] with any [[Flight Service Station]]. Except for the take-off portion of his flight, Kennedy did not contact any air traffic controllers; during the flight, he never requested help or declared an emergency.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSN0722279520070208 John F. Kennedy Jr.'s last radio comments were routine], 2007-02-07</ref> Under the conditions of his flight, Kennedy was not required to file a flight plan, and because he did not, no one knew his exact route or expected time of his arrival. According to the Weather Service International, as reported in the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board, Kennedy made two weather requests before taking off. The information he was provided indicated that visibility ranged from 10 miles along his route to four miles at Martha's Vineyard.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ntsb.gov/about/employment/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief2.aspx?ev_id=20001212X19354&ntsbno=NYC99MA178&akey=1|website=National Transportation Safety Board|title=National Transportation Safety Board Investigation}}</ref>\n\n====Flight over featureless, open water====\n\nShortly after passing [[Point Judith, Rhode Island]], Kennedy's plane headed directly towards Martha's Vineyard. Instead of following the coastline of [[Rhode Island Sound]] and [[Buzzards Bay]], which would have provided visible lights on the ground, Kennedy chose the shorter, direct path over a 30-mile (50&nbsp;km) open stretch of water.<ref>{{cite news|title=\"We dared to think that this John Kennedy would live to comb gray hair\"|url=http://www.thedailyobserver.ca/2012/07/19/we-dared-to-think-that-this-john-kennedy-would-live-to-comb-gray-hair|publisher=The Daily Observer|date=July 19, 2012}}</ref> According to the FAA Airplane Flying Handbook, crossing large bodies of water at night may be very hazardous, not only from the standpoint of ditching in the water but also because the featureless horizon visually blends with the water, in which case [[depth perception]] and [[Spatial disorientation|orientation]] become difficult.\n\n====Foot injury====\n\nSix weeks before the crash, Kennedy had fractured his left ankle in a [[paragliding]] accident over the Memorial Day weekend. He had surgery and wore a cast which was removed just the day before the fatal flight. He still walked with a limp on the day of the accident.<ref>{{cite news |title=Carolyn's Terrible Premonition \u2013 She Told Saks Girl She Dreaded Flying That Night |url=https://nypost.com/1999/07/22/car0lyns-terrible-prem0niti0n-she-told-saks-girl-she-dreaded-flying-that-night/ |newspaper=The New York Post |date=July 22, 1999}}</ref> During his interviews, Kennedy's orthopaedic surgeon stated that, at the time of the crash, he would have been able to apply the type of pressure that would normally be required to drive a car.<ref name=\"Klein\">{{cite book|authorlink=Edward Klein|last=Klein|first=Edward|title=The Kennedy Curse: Why Tragedy Has Haunted America's First Family for 150 Years|location=New York|publisher=Pocket Books|year=1996}}</ref>\n\n====Incorrect radio frequencies====\n\nWhile the NTSB examined the wreckage, they soon discovered that both of Kennedy's radios had incorrect frequencies selected. Kennedy had accidentally selected 127.25 for Martha Vineyard's [[Automatic Terminal Information Service|ATIS]] instead of 126.25; likewise, he selected 135.25 for Essex County ATIS but it should have been 135.5.

Kennedy's wife, [[Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy|Carolyn Bessette]], and sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette, were also on board and died. The single-engine [[Piper Saratoga]] had departed from New Jersey's [[Essex County Airport]], and its intended route was along the coastline of [[Connecticut]] and across [[Rhode Island Sound]] to [[Martha's Vineyard Airport]].\n\nThe official investigation by the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) concluded that Kennedy fell victim to [[spatial disorientation]] while he was descending over water at night and consequently lost control of his plane. Kennedy did not hold an [[instrument rating]] and therefore he was only certified to fly under [[visual flight rules]]. At the time of the crash, the weather and light conditions were such that all basic landmarks were obscured, making visual flight challenging, although legally still permissible.\n\n== Background ==\nOn the evening of July 16, 1999, [[John F.

MA}}</ref>\n\n==Investigation==\nThe [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) officially declared that Kennedy's plane had crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Martha's Vineyard. The probable cause of the crash was \"the pilot's failure to maintain control of the airplane during a descent over water at night, which was a result of spatial disorientation\".<ref name=NTSB.Factual /> Kennedy was not qualified to fly his plane by \"instruments only\". The crash occurred in conditions not legally requiring such qualification. Other pilots flying similar routes on the night of the crash reported no visual horizon due to [[haze]].<ref name=NTSB.Factual/>\n\n=== Possible contributing factors ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=July 2012}}\n'''Haze and visibility'''\n\nAtmospheric conditions along Kennedy's flight path on the night of the crash were occasionally hazy, which can lead to [[spatial disorientation]] for pilots. The weather was officially listed as \"[[visual meteorological conditions]]\" (VMC), which allowed Kennedy to fly under [[Visual Flight Rules]] (VFR) rather than [[Instrument Flight Rules]] (IFR), despite the fact he lacked an [[instrument rating]]. The visibility was very poor in Essex County, New Jersey and airports along Kennedy's flight path reported visibility between 5 and 8 miles with haze and a few clouds. Some pilots flying similar routes as Kennedy on the night of the accident reported no [[Visual flight|visual horizon]] over water because of haze. Also, the NTSB reported on one pilot who cancelled a similar flight that evening due to \"poor\" weather. The conditions near the crash site were: \"Clear skies at or below 12,000 feet; visibility 10 miles\".<ref name=NTSB.Factual/>\n\n'''Pilot experience'''\n\nKennedy first obtained his [[Private Pilot License|private pilot license]] in 1998 and received \"high performance airplane\" and \"[[complex airplane]]\" endorsements two months before the crash.<ref name=NTSB.Factual/> His estimated total flight experience before the crash was about 310 hours, of which 55 hours were at night. His estimated flight time in the accident airplane was about 36 hours, of which about nine hours were at night. About three hours of that flight time were without a [[Certified Flight Instructor]] (CFI) on board, and only 48 minutes of that time was flown at night, which included a night landing.<ref name=NTSB.Factual/>\n\nIt's not clear how much of his total flight experience was in the plane type that crashed or in Kennedy's other more basic plane, the [[Cessna Skylane|Cessna Skylane 182]]. Fifteen months before the crash, Kennedy had flown about 35 flights either to or from northern New Jersey and the Martha's Vineyard area. Kennedy flew more than 17 of these legs without a CFI on board, including at least five at night. His last known flight in his airplane without a CFI on board happened two months before the crash.<ref name=NTSB.Factual/>\n\n'''Pilot training'''\n\nThe CFI who prepared Kennedy for his private pilot checkride stated that he had \"very good\" flying skills for his level of experience.<ref name=\"Salon.com\">{{cite web|title=JFK Jr.: The truth behind the crash|url=https://www.salon.com/2000/07/07/kennedy_13/|website=Salon, July 7, 2000|publisher=Salon.com}}</ref> Four months before the crash, Kennedy passed the FAA's written airplane instrument examination and later enrolled in an instrument rating course. He continued to receive flight instruction in New Jersey in his plane, including flights from CDW to MVY. His instructors said Kennedy required help working the [[rudder]] pedals to taxi and land the plane because of his ankle injury.<ref name=\"Salon.com\"/>\n\nDuring a training flight at night under [[Instrument meteorological conditions|instrument conditions]], his instructor stated that Kennedy had the ability to fly the airplane without a visible horizon but may have experienced difficulty performing additional tasks under such conditions. He also stated that the pilot was not ready for an instrument evaluation and needed additional training. The instructor at the time of the crash was not aware that Kennedy would be flying in those conditions without an instructor on board. The CFI further stated that he had talked to Kennedy on the night of the accident and offered to fly with him that night. He stated that Kennedy had the capability to conduct a night flight to Martha's Vineyard as long as a visible horizon existed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Safety Board Blames Pilot Error in Crash of Kennedy Plane|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/07/nyregion/safety-board-blames-pilot-error-in-crash-of-kennedy-plane.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 7, 2000}}</ref>\n\n'''Psychological stress'''\n\nThe NTSB suggested that Kennedy's marriage may have contributed to a source of stress by the time of the crash.<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,90819,00.html Book Details John F.

Distractions can so interfere with judgment that unwarranted risks are taken, such as flying into deteriorating weather conditions to keep on schedule.\"\n\n====Pilot distraction====\n\nFrom 8:49&nbsp;p.m., about 10 minutes after departure, and for a 5 minute period lasting until 8:54&nbsp;p.m., Kennedy's plane flew in the same vicinity as [[American Airlines]] Flight 1484, a [[Fokker 100]], which was on approach to [[Westchester County Airport]] (HPN).<ref name=NTSB.Factual/> The [[Traffic collision avoidance system]] (TCAS) sounded on the Fokker 100, leading to some discussion between the Fokker and the New York approach controller (ATC). However, the interaction ended with American Airlines Flight 1484 reporting to ATC that they believe the other plane was a Piper and that the TCAS warning was resolved. No corrective action was reported to have been taken by ATC nor American Airlines Flight 1484.<ref name=NTSB.Factual/> It's not known if Kennedy was aware of, or distracted by, the incident.\n\n====Late departure====\n\nThe flight was originally scheduled for daylight hours but had to be postponed after Kennedy's sister-in-law was delayed at work. Heavy traffic further delayed Kennedy's flight and pushed it back until after dark. Originally planned to depart at 6:00&nbsp;p.m., Kennedy's plane departed at 8:39&nbsp;p.m. instead, nearly a half-hour past sunset. At the time of the takeoff, the moon was just above the horizon and provided very little illumination.\n\n====No flight plan or request for help====\n\nKennedy never received a weather briefing or filed a [[flight plan]] with any [[Flight Service Station]]. Except for the take-off portion of his flight, Kennedy did not contact any air traffic controllers; during the flight, he never requested help or declared an emergency.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSN0722279520070208 John F. Kennedy Jr.'s last radio comments were routine], 2007-02-07</ref> Under the conditions of his flight, Kennedy was not required to file a flight plan, and because he did not, no one knew his exact route or expected time of his arrival. According to the Weather Service International, as reported in the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board, Kennedy made two weather requests before taking off. The information he was provided indicated that visibility ranged from 10 miles along his route to four miles at Martha's Vineyard.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ntsb.gov/about/employment/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief2.aspx?ev_id=20001212X19354&ntsbno=NYC99MA178&akey=1|website=National Transportation Safety Board|title=National Transportation Safety Board Investigation}}</ref>\n\n====Flight over featureless, open water====\n\nShortly after passing [[Point Judith, Rhode Island]], Kennedy's plane headed directly towards Martha's Vineyard. Instead of following the coastline of [[Rhode Island Sound]] and [[Buzzards Bay]], which would have provided visible lights on the ground, Kennedy chose the shorter, direct path over a 30-mile (50&nbsp;km) open stretch of water.<ref>{{cite news|title=\"We dared to think that this John Kennedy would live to comb gray hair\"|url=http://www.thedailyobserver.ca/2012/07/19/we-dared-to-think-that-this-john-kennedy-would-live-to-comb-gray-hair|publisher=The Daily Observer|date=July 19, 2012}}</ref> According to the FAA Airplane Flying Handbook, crossing large bodies of water at night may be very hazardous, not only from the standpoint of ditching in the water but also because the featureless horizon visually blends with the water, in which case [[depth perception]] and [[Spatial disorientation|orientation]] become difficult.\n\n====Foot injury====\n\nSix weeks before the crash, Kennedy had fractured his left ankle in a [[paragliding]] accident over the Memorial Day weekend. He had surgery and wore a cast which was removed just the day before the fatal flight. He still walked with a limp on the day of the accident.<ref>{{cite news |title=Carolyn's Terrible Premonition \u2013 She Told Saks Girl She Dreaded Flying That Night |url=https://nypost.com/1999/07/22/car0lyns-terrible-prem0niti0n-she-told-saks-girl-she-dreaded-flying-that-night/ |newspaper=The New York Post |date=July 22, 1999}}</ref> During his interviews, Kennedy's orthopaedic surgeon stated that, at the time of the crash, he would have been able to apply the type of pressure that would normally be required to drive a car.<ref name=\"Klein\">{{cite book|authorlink=Edward Klein|last=Klein|first=Edward|title=The Kennedy Curse: Why Tragedy Has Haunted America's First Family for 150 Years|location=New York|publisher=Pocket Books|year=1996}}</ref>\n\n====Incorrect radio frequencies====\n\nWhile the NTSB examined the wreckage, they soon discovered that both of Kennedy's radios had incorrect frequencies selected. Kennedy had accidentally selected 127.25 for Martha Vineyard's [[Automatic Terminal Information Service|ATIS]] instead of 126.25; likewise, he selected 135.25 for Essex County ATIS but it should have been 135.5.

Fourcroy collaborated with Lavoisier, [[Guyton de Morveau]], and [[Claude Berthollet]] on the ''M\u00e9thode de nomenclature chimique'', a work that helped standardize [[chemical nomenclature]].\n\n==Early Life==\nFourcroy was born in [[Paris, France|Paris]], the son of an [[apothecary]] in the household of the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans.  On the advice of the [[anatomist]] [[F\u00e9lix Vicq-d'Azyr]] (1748\u20131794) he took up [[medicine|medical]] studies, and after many difficulties caused by lack of means he finally obtained his doctor's diploma in 1780. He taught chemistry from (1783\u20131787) at the Veterinary School of Alfort.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/antoine-francois-de-fourcroy/|title=ANTOINE FRAN\u00c7OIS DE FOURCROY|last=Universalis|first=Encyclop\u00e6dia|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Universalis|language=fr|access-date=2017-02-20}}</ref>  Fourcroy's attention was turned specifically to [[chemistry]] by [[Jean Baptiste Michel Bucquet|J. B. M. Bucquet]] (1746\u20131780), the professor of chemistry at the Medical School of Paris.  In 1784 Fourcroy was chosen to succeed [[P. J.

Fourcroy's 1785 publication, ''Entomologia Parisiensis, sive, Catalogus insectorum quae in agro Parisiensi reperiuntur ...'', co-written with [[\u00c9tienne Louis Geoffroy]], was a major contribution to systematic [[entomology]].\n\nLater with [[Louis Nicolas Vauquelin]], he identified a metal  in a platinum residue they called \u2018''pt\u00e8ne''\u2019.This name \u2018ptene\u2019 or \u2018pt\u00e8ne\u2019 was reported as an early synonym for [[osmium]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Haubrichs|first=Rolf|last2=Zaffalon|first2=Pierre-Leonard|date=2017|title=Osmium vs. \u2018Pt\u00e8ne\u2019: The Naming of the Densest Metal|url=http://www.technology.matthey.com/article/61/3/190-196/|journal=Johnson Matthey Technology Review|volume=61|pages=|doi=10.1595/205651317x695631|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Biological and Neurochemical Work ===\nFourcroy's views and studies grew from Bucquet.

During this period of work with Vauquelin, Fourcroy founded his own journal: ''La M\u00e9decine \u00e9clair\u00e9e par les sciences physiques, ou Journal des d\u00e9couvertes relatives aux differentes parties de l'art de gu\u00e9rir,'' which detailed his investigations of chemistry and body materials. Fourcroy was convinced that \"the successes of chemistry would one day change the face of medicine and result in beneficial revolution\"\n\nAlthough Fourcroy's name appears on a large number of chemical and also [[physiology|physiological]] and [[pathology|pathological]] memoirs, he was as much a teacher and an organizer as an original investigator.<ref name=\"EB1911\" /> Beginning in 1791, Fourcroy would go on to publish three memoirs compounding his series of biological experiments, most of which had to do with the chemistry of the human brain. In his first, Fourcroy described the conditions of the brains of the cadavers that he studied. In his second, he would recount his continuing chemical experimentation on the fatty matter in the brain, now known as [[Lipid|lipids]], as well as the inorganic components present. By using newer methods than the [[Alchemy|alchemical]] tradition that had proceeded him, such as extraction and qualitative analysis, Fourcroy concluded that the brain was composed of fatty acids in combination with bases along with recording some physical properties of the substance. His third memoir was a continuation of the separations and extractions he performed on brain matter and addition to his growing compendium of the brain's chemical constituents. One of the most fruitful results of this work was the rediscovery of phosphorus in the brain, reintroducing the 1719 discovery by Johann Thomas Hensing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sourkes|first=Theodore|date=1992|title=The origins of neurochemistry: The chemical study of the brain in France at the end of the 18th century|url=|journal=Journal of the history of medicine and allied sciences|volume=47|pages=322-339|via=}}</ref>[[File:Fourcroy,_Antoine_Fran\u00e7ois_de_(1755-1809)_CIPB1616.jpg|alt=|thumb|A marble bust of Fourcroy designed by [[Antoine-Denis Chaudet]] and completed by [[Pierre Cartellier]] in 1811.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Legrand|first=No\u00e9|title=Les collections artistiques de la Facult\u00e9 de m\u00e9decine de Paris : inventaire raisonn\u00e9 / par No\u00e9 Legrand|publisher=Masson (Paris)|year=1911|isbn=|location=Paris, France|pages=76}}</ref>]]\n\nFourcroy also had a prominent role in developing law that would affect medical education in France.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2004-04-01|title=The Officiers de Sant\u00e9 of the French Revolution: A Case Study in the Changing Language of Medicine|pmc=546340|journal=Medical History|language=en|volume=48|issue=2|pmid=15151105|pages=229\u201344 | last1 = Crosland | first1 = M|doi=10.1017/s0025727300007407}}</ref> Fourcroy collaborated with physician [[Fran\u00e7ois Chaussier|Francois Chaussier]] to create a report that would be the basis of the [[Law of 1794]], which integrated medicine and surgery and established health schools that taught both of these fields to all students.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Science and the Practice of Medicine in the Nineteenth Century|last=Bynum|first=W.F.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994|isbn=9780521272056|location=United States of America|pages=26, 28|quote=|via=}}</ref> Prior to this law, medical education was heterogeneous throughout France, with several different colleges and universities operating under varying standards.

By the end of that year, after holding several positions in the [[National Convention]], he was elected as the president of the [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin party]], taking a seat on the [[Committee of Public Safety]] in the process, which he held for about ten months. He would subsequently hold other high ranking positions and directorships in educational institutes and museums during the revolutionary regime and [[Napoleon|Napoleon's]] government as well. As an important counselor to Bonaparte, Fourcroy was appointed Minister of Public Instruction in 1802, responsible for education in France at all levels, which he held until his death in December 1809.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sourkes|first=Theodore|date=1992|title=The origins of neurochemistry: The chemical study of the brain in France at the end of the 18th century|url=|journal=Journal of the history of medicine and allied sciences|volume=47|pages=322-339|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n=== \"The Chemical Revolution\" ===\nFourcroy was not the first to publish the phrase \"[[Chemical revolution]],\" even Bucquet described new developments in pneumatic chemistry in 1778 as a \"great revolution in chemistry.\" However, it was Fourcroy that began to better describe the term by lengthening the time scale and broadening the map of nations that were contributing to the Chemical revolution in his written works. <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Guerlac|first=Henry|title=Essays and Papers in the History of Modern Science|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1977|isbn=0801819148|location=Baltimore, MD|pages=405-410}}</ref> It was Fourcroy who had initially noted the division that chemistry had undergone from [[natural history]], concluding that the two studies no longer shared objectives nor methods. While natural historians of his era merely described and preserved that which they studied, as Fourcroy believed, it was chemists who now sought to uncover the most fundamental structures of the natural world by experimental analysis. In his publications, Fourcroy referred to many other contemporary chemists as well as those from other nations, proposing that the extensive chemical reform being done was a collaborative effort. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bensaude-Vincent|first=Bernadette|date=1990|title=A view of the chemical revolution through contemporary textbooks: Lavoisier, Fourcroy and Chaptal|url=|journal=The British journal for the history of science|volume=23|pages=435-460|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Awards and Honors ===\nIn 1801, Fourcroy was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].\n\nOn December 16, 1809, the very day on which he died in Paris, Fourcroy was created a count of the French empire.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> He is buried in the [[P\u00e8re-Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris.\n\nAntoine-Fran\u00e7ois de Fourcroy's  1787 publication entitled ''M\u00e9thode de Nomenclature Chimique'', published with colleagues [[Antoine Lavoisier]], [[Claude Louis Berthollet]], and [[Louis Bernard Guyton de Morveau]],<ref name=publication>{{cite book|last1=Guyton de Morveau|first1=Louis Bernard|last2=Lavoisier|first2=Antoine Laurent|last3=Berthollet|first3=Claude-Louis|last4=Fourcroy|first4=Antoine-Fran\u00e7ois de|title=M\u00e9thode de Nomenclature Chimique|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_0MMPAAAAQAAJ_2|date=1787|publisher=Chez Cuchet (Sous le Privil\u00e9ge de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences)|location=Paris, France}}</ref> was honored by a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society, presented at the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences (Paris) in 2015.<ref name=\"Award\">{{cite web|title= 2015 Awardees|url=http://www.scs.illinois.edu/~mainzv/HIST/awards/CCB-2015_Awardees.php|website=American Chemical Society,  Division of the History of Chemistry|publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign School of Chemical Sciences|date=2015|accessdate=1 July 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Breakthrough\">{{cite web|title=Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award|url=http://www.scs.illinois.edu/~mainzv/HIST/awards/Citations/2015-Guyton%20de%20Morveau%20Lavoisier%20plaque.pdf|website=American Chemical Society,  Division of the History of Chemistry|publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign School of Chemical Sciences|date=2015|accessdate=1 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nIt is believed that [[Cape Fourcroy]], at the western tip of [[Bathurst Island, Northern Territory]], Australia, is named after Fourcroy.

On the advice of the [[anatomist]] [[F\u00e9lix Vicq-d'Azyr]] (1748\u20131794) he took up [[medicine|medical]] studies, and after many difficulties caused by lack of means he finally obtained his doctor's diploma in 1780. He taught chemistry from (1783\u20131787) at the Veterinary School of Alfort.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/antoine-francois-de-fourcroy/|title=ANTOINE FRAN\u00c7OIS DE FOURCROY|last=Universalis|first=Encyclop\u00e6dia|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Universalis|language=fr|access-date=2017-02-20}}</ref>  Fourcroy's attention was turned specifically to [[chemistry]] by [[Jean Baptiste Michel Bucquet|J. B. M. Bucquet]] (1746\u20131780), the professor of chemistry at the Medical School of Paris.  In 1784 Fourcroy was chosen to succeed [[P. J.

During this period of work with Vauquelin, Fourcroy founded his own journal: ''La M\u00e9decine \u00e9clair\u00e9e par les sciences physiques, ou Journal des d\u00e9couvertes relatives aux differentes parties de l'art de gu\u00e9rir,'' which detailed his investigations of chemistry and body materials. Fourcroy was convinced that \"the successes of chemistry would one day change the face of medicine and result in beneficial revolution\"\n\nAlthough Fourcroy's name appears on a large number of chemical and also [[physiology|physiological]] and [[pathology|pathological]] memoirs, he was as much a teacher and an organizer as an original investigator.<ref name=\"EB1911\" /> Beginning in 1791, Fourcroy would go on to publish three memoirs compounding his series of biological experiments, most of which had to do with the chemistry of the human brain. In his first, Fourcroy described the conditions of the brains of the cadavers that he studied. In his second, he would recount his continuing chemical experimentation on the fatty matter in the brain, now known as [[Lipid|lipids]], as well as the inorganic components as well. By using newer methods than the [[Alchemy|alchemical]] tradition that had proceeded him, such as extraction and qualitative analysis, Fourcroy concluded that the brain was composed of fatty acids in combination with bases along with recording some physical properties of the substance. His third memoir was a continuation of the separations and extractions he performed on brain matter and addition to his growing compendium of the brain's chemical constituents. One of the most fruitful results of this work was the rediscovery of phosphorus in the brain, reintroducing the 1719 discovery by Johann Thomas Hensing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sourkes|first=Theodore|date=1992|title=The origins of neurochemistry: The chemical study of the brain in France at the end of the 18th century|url=|journal=Journal of the history of medicine and allied sciences|volume=47|pages=322-339|via=}}</ref>[[File:Fourcroy,_Antoine_Fran\u00e7ois_de_(1755-1809)_CIPB1616.jpg|alt=|thumb|A marble bust of Fourcroy designed by [[Antoine-Denis Chaudet]] and completed by [[Pierre Cartellier]] in 1811.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Legrand|first=No\u00e9|title=Les collections artistiques de la Facult\u00e9 de m\u00e9decine de Paris : inventaire raisonn\u00e9 / par No\u00e9 Legrand|publisher=Masson (Paris)|year=1911|isbn=|location=Paris, France|pages=76}}</ref>]]\n\nFourcroy also had a prominent role in developing law that would affect medical education in France.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2004-04-01|title=The Officiers de Sant\u00e9 of the French Revolution: A Case Study in the Changing Language of Medicine|pmc=546340|journal=Medical History|language=en|volume=48|issue=2|pmid=15151105|pages=229\u201344 | last1 = Crosland | first1 = M|doi=10.1017/s0025727300007407}}</ref> Fourcroy collaborated with physician [[Fran\u00e7ois Chaussier|Francois Chaussier]] to create a report that would be the basis of the [[Law of 1794]], which integrated medicine and surgery and established health schools that taught both of these fields to all students.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Science and the Practice of Medicine in the Nineteenth Century|last=Bynum|first=W.F.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994|isbn=9780521272056|location=United States of America|pages=26, 28|quote=|via=}}</ref> Prior to this law, medical education was heterogeneous throughout France, with several different colleges and universities operating under varying standards.

By the end of that year, after holding several positions in the [[National Convention]], he was elected as the president of the [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin party]], taking a seat on the [[Committee of Public Safety]] in the process, which he held for about ten months. He would subsequently hold other high ranking positions and directorships in educational institutes and museums during the revolutionary regime and [[Napoleon|Napoleon's]] government as well. As an important counselor to Bonaparte, Fourcroy was appointed Minister of Public Instruction in 1802, responsible for education in France at all levels, which he held until his death in December 1809.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sourkes|first=Theodore|date=1992|title=The origins of neurochemistry: The chemical study of the brain in France at the end of the 18th century|url=|journal=Journal of the history of medicine and allied sciences|volume=47|pages=322-339|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n=== \"The Chemical Revolution\" ===\nFourcroy was not the first to publish the phrase \"[[Chemical revolution]],\" even Bucquet described new developments in pneumatic chemistry in 1778 as a \"great revolution in chemistry.\" However, it was Fourcroy that began to better describe the term by lengthening the time scale and broadening the map of nations that were contributing to the Chemical revolution in his written works. <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Guerlac|first=Henry|title=Essays and Papers in the History of Modern Science|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1977|isbn=0801819148|location=Baltimore, MD|pages=405-410}}</ref> It was Fourcroy who had initially noted the division that chemistry had undergone from [[natural history]], concluding that the two studies no longer shared objectives nor methods. While natural historians of his era merely described and preserved that which they studied, as Fourcroy believed, it was chemists who now sought to uncover the most fundamental structures of the natural world by experimental analysis. In his publications, Fourcroy referred to many other contemporary chemists as well as those from other nations, proposing that the extensive chemical reform being done was a collaborative effort. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bensaude-Vincent|first=Bernadette|date=1990|title=A view of the chemical revolution through contemporary textbooks: Lavoisier, Fourcroy and Chaptal|url=|journal=The British journal for the history of science|volume=23|pages=435-460|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Awards and Honors ===\nIn 1801, Fourcroy was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].\n\nOn December 16, 1809, the very day on which he died in Paris, Fourcroy was created a count of the French empire.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> He is buried in the [[P\u00e8re-Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris.\n\nAntoine-Fran\u00e7ois de Fourcroy's  1787 publication entitled ''M\u00e9thode de Nomenclature Chimique'', published with colleagues [[Antoine Lavoisier]], [[Claude Louis Berthollet]], and [[Louis Bernard Guyton de Morveau]],<ref name=publication>{{cite book|last1=Guyton de Morveau|first1=Louis Bernard|last2=Lavoisier|first2=Antoine Laurent|last3=Berthollet|first3=Claude-Louis|last4=Fourcroy|first4=Antoine-Fran\u00e7ois de|title=M\u00e9thode de Nomenclature Chimique|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_0MMPAAAAQAAJ_2|date=1787|publisher=Chez Cuchet (Sous le Privil\u00e9ge de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences)|location=Paris, France}}</ref> was honored by a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society, presented at the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences (Paris) in 2015.<ref name=\"Award\">{{cite web|title= 2015 Awardees|url=http://www.scs.illinois.edu/~mainzv/HIST/awards/CCB-2015_Awardees.php|website=American Chemical Society,  Division of the History of Chemistry|publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign School of Chemical Sciences|date=2015|accessdate=1 July 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Breakthrough\">{{cite web|title=Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award|url=http://www.scs.illinois.edu/~mainzv/HIST/awards/Citations/2015-Guyton%20de%20Morveau%20Lavoisier%20plaque.pdf|website=American Chemical Society,  Division of the History of Chemistry|publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign School of Chemical Sciences|date=2015|accessdate=1 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nIt is believed that [[Cape Fourcroy]], at the western tip of [[Bathurst Island, Northern Territory]], Australia, is named after Fourcroy.

The order includes more than 1,000 described [[species]] in about 153 [[genus|genera]]. Despite the common names, they are neither true [[scorpion]]s (order Scorpiones) nor true [[spider]]s (order [[Araneae]]). Much like a spider, the body of a solifugid has two [[Tagma (biology)|tagmata]]: an [[opisthosoma]] (abdomen) behind the [[prosoma]] (that is, in effect, a combined head and thorax). At the front end, the prosoma bears two [[chelicerae]] that, in most species, are conspicuously large. The chelicerae serve as jaws and in many species also are used for [[stridulation]]. Unlike scorpions, solifugids do not have a third tagma that forms a \"tail\". Most species of Solifugae live in [[dry climate]]s and feed opportunistically on ground-dwelling [[arthropod]]s and other small animals. The largest species grow to a length of {{convert|12|-|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}, including legs. A number of urban legends exaggerate the size and speed of the Solifugae, and their potential danger to humans, which is negligible.\n\n==Anatomy==\n[[File:Solifugae Ventral aspect of respiratory slots 2012 01 24 0985s.JPG|thumb|Ventral aspect of a solifugid, showing respiratory slots]]\nSolifugae are moderately small to large arachnids (a few millimeters to several centimeters in body length), with the larger species reaching {{convert|12|-|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in length, including legs.<ref name=\"geographic\">{{cite web |url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/bugs/egyptian-giant-solpugid/ |title=Egyptian giant solpugid (camel spider) ''Galeodes arabs'' |publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] |accessdate=June 10, 2011}}</ref><ref name=schmidt93/> In practice, the respective lengths of the legs of various species differ drastically, so the resulting figures are often misleading.

As shown in the illustrations, the solifugid prosoma and opisthosoma are not separated by nearly as clear a constriction and connecting tube or \"[[Pedicel (spider)|pedicel]]\" as occurs in \"true spiders\", the order Araneae. The lack of the pedicel reflects another difference between the Solifugae and spiders, namely that solifugids lack both spinnerets and [[Spider silk|silk]], and do not spin [[Spiderweb|webs]]. Spiders need considerable mobility of their abdomens in their spinning activities, and the Solifugae have no need for any such adaptation.\n\nThe prosoma comprises the head, the mouthparts, and the [[somite]]s that bear the legs and the [[pedipalps]]. The alternative name \"cephalothorax\" reflects the fact that the prosoma includes the parts that in insects form the head plus the thorax. Though it is not split into two clear tagmata, the prosoma does have a large, relatively well-defined anterior carapace, bearing the animal's eyes and chelicerae, while a smaller posterior section bears the legs.<ref name=\"Punzo\"/><ref name=IZ>{{Cite book|author= Barnes, Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 613\u2013614|isbn= 0-03-056747-5}}</ref>\n\nLike [[pseudoscorpion]]s and [[harvestmen]], the Solifugae lack [[book lung]]s, having instead a well-developed [[Invertebrate trachea|tracheal system]] that inhales and exhales air through a number of spiracles; one pair between the second and third pair of walking legs, two pairs on the abdomen on abdominal segments three and four, and an unpaired spiracle on the fifth abdominal segment.<ref>[https://books.google.no/books?id=x7vtCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA126&dq=%22To+the+primary+paired+spiracles+in+opisthosoma+segments+3+and+4%22&hl=no&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjhi7jbtJnlAhUEuIsKHRP7C2EQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=%22To%20the%20primary%20paired%20spiracles%20in%20opisthosoma%20segments%203%20and%204%22&f=false Multicellular Animals: Volume II: The Phylogenetic System of the Metazoa]</ref>\n\n===Chelicerae===\n[[File:Solifugae Chelicera lateral aspect 2012 01 24 0999s.JPG|thumb|Lateral aspect of chelicera, showing teeth and cutting edge]]\nAmong the most distinctive features of the Solifugae are their large [[chelicerae]], which in many species are longer than the prosoma.

The order includes more than 1,000 described [[species]] in about 153 [[genus|genera]]. Despite the common names, they are neither true [[scorpion]]s (order Scorpiones) nor true [[spider]]s (order [[Araneae]]). Much like a spider, the body of a solifugid has two [[Tagma (biology)|tagmata]]: an [[opisthosoma]] (abdomen) behind the [[prosoma]] (that is, in effect, a combined head and thorax). At the front end, the prosoma bears two [[chelicerae]] that, in most species, are conspicuously large. The chelicerae serve as jaws and in many species also are used for [[stridulation]]. Unlike scorpions, solifugids do not have a third tagma that forms a \"tail\". Most species of Solifugae live in [[dry climate]]s and feed opportunistically on ground-dwelling [[arthropod]]s and other small animals. The largest species grow to a length of {{convert|12|-|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}, including legs. A number of urban legends exaggerate the size and speed of the Solifugae, and their potential danger to humans, which is negligible.\n\n==Anatomy==\n[[File:Solifugae Ventral aspect of respiratory slots 2012 01 24 0985s.JPG|thumb|Ventral aspect of a solifugid, showing respiratory slots]]\nSolifugae are moderately small to large arachnids (a few millimeters to several centimeters in body length), with the larger species reaching {{convert|12|-|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in length, including legs.<ref name=\"geographic\">{{cite web |url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/bugs/egyptian-giant-solpugid/ |title=Egyptian giant solpugid (camel spider) ''Galeodes arabs'' |publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] |accessdate=June 10, 2011}}</ref><ref name=schmidt93/> In practice, the respective lengths of the legs of various species differ drastically, so the resulting figures are often misleading.

As shown in the illustrations, the solifugid prosoma and opisthosoma are not separated by nearly as clear a constriction and connecting tube or \"[[Pedicel (spider)|pedicel]]\" as occurs in \"true spiders\", the order Araneae. The lack of the pedicel reflects another difference between the Solifugae and spiders, namely that solifugids lack both spinnerets and [[Spider silk|silk]], and do not spin [[Spiderweb|webs]]. Spiders need considerable mobility of their abdomens in their spinning activities, and the Solifugae have no need for any such adaptation.\n\nThe prosoma comprises the head, the mouthparts, and the [[somite]]s that bear the legs and the [[pedipalps]]. The alternative name \"cephalothorax\" reflects the fact that the prosoma includes the parts that in insects form the head plus the thorax. Though it is not split into two clear tagmata, the prosoma does have a large, relatively well-defined anterior carapace, bearing the animal's eyes and chelicerae, while a smaller posterior section bears the legs.<ref name=\"Punzo\"/><ref name=IZ>{{Cite book|author= Barnes, Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 613\u2013614|isbn= 0-03-056747-5}}</ref>\n\nLike [[pseudoscorpion]]s and [[harvestmen]], the Solifugae lack [[book lung]]s, having instead a well-developed [[Invertebrate trachea|tracheal system]] that inhales and exhales air through a number of spiracles; one pair between the second and third pair of walking legs, two pairs on the abdomen on abdominal segments three and four, and an unpaired spiracle on the fifth abdominal segment.<ref>[https://books.google.no/books?id=x7vtCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA126&dq=%22To+the+primary+paired+spiracles+in+opisthosoma+segments+3+and+4%22&hl=no&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjhi7jbtJnlAhUEuIsKHRP7C2EQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=%22To%20the%20primary%20paired%20spiracles%20in%20opisthosoma%20segments%203%20and%204%22&f=false Multicellular Animals: Volume II: The Phylogenetic System of the Metazoa]</ref>\n\n===Chelicerae===\n[[File:Solifugae Chelicera lateral aspect 2012 01 24 0999s.JPG|thumb|Lateral aspect of chelicera, showing teeth and cutting edge]]\nAmong the most distinctive features of the Solifugae are their large [[chelicerae]], which in many species are longer than the prosoma.

At the tips of their pedipalps, Solifugae bear [[:wikt:evert|eversible]] adhesive organs, which they may use to capture flying prey, and which at least some species certainly use for climbing smooth surfaces.<ref name=\"ISBN 978-0-7993-4689-3\" /><ref name=\"CNH\">Harmer, Sir Sidney Frederic; Shipley, Arthur Everett et alia: The Cambridge natural history Volume 4, Crustacea, Trilobites, Arachnida, Tardigrada, Pentastomida etc. Macmillan Company 1895</ref>\n[[File:Solifugae Solpugidae showing malleoli 2012 01 24 0964s.JPG|thumb|A female of a species in the family Solpugidae showing the malleoli beneath the posterior pair of legs]]\n\nFor the most part, only the posterior three pairs of legs are used for running.<ref name=IZ/><ref name=\"ISBN 978-0-7993-4689-3\"/> On the undersides of the coxae and trochanters of the last pair of legs, Solifugae have fan-shaped sensory organs called [[malleolus (arthropod)|malleoli]] or racquet (or racket) organs.

They have been suspected to be sensory organs for the detection of vibrations in the soil, perhaps to detect threats and potential prey or mates.<ref name=\"ISBN 978-0-7993-4689-3\"/> These structures may be chemoreceptors.<ref name=Punzo1998>{{cite book|last1=Punzo|first1=Fred|title=The Biology of Camel-Spiders: Arachnida, Solifugae|date=1998|publisher=Springer US|location=Boston, MA|isbn=9781461557272|page=66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PbTSBwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP7&ots=I2zVuma5R6&dq=solifugae%20malleolar&lr&pg=PA66#v=onepage&q=malleoli%20&f=false|accessdate=21 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nMales are usually smaller than females, with relatively longer legs.<ref name=schmidt93/> Unlike females, the males bear a pair of [[flagella]], one on each chelicera.

Solifuges are aggressive hunters and voracious opportunistic feeders and have been recorded as feeding on [[snakes]], small [[lizards]], and [[rodents]].<ref name=\"Punzo\"/> Prey is located with the pedipalps and killed and cut into pieces by the chelicerae. The prey is then liquefied and the liquid ingested through the [[pharynx]]. Although they do not normally attack humans, their chelicerae can penetrate human skin, and painful bites have been reported.<ref name=schmidt93/>\n\nVarious other predators, such as the [[large slit-faced bat]], scorpions, toads, and [[insectivore]]s, may prey on Solifugae.\n\n==Life cycle==\nSolifugae are typically [[univoltine]] (reproducing once a year).<ref name=\"Punzo\"/>{{rp|8}} Reproduction can involve direct or indirect [[sperm]] transfer; when indirect, the male emits a [[spermatophore]] on the ground and then inserts it with his chelicerae in the female's genital pore. To do this, he flings the female on her back.\n\nThe female then digs a burrow, into which she lays 50 to 200 eggs \u2013 some species then guard them until they hatch. Because the female does not feed during this time, she will try to fatten herself beforehand, and a species of {{convert|5|cm|abbr=on}} has been observed to eat more than 100 flies during that time in the laboratory.<ref name=schmidt93/> Solifugae undergo a number of stages including, egg, postembryo, 9\u201310 nymphal instars, and adults.<ref name=\"Punzo\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name Solifugae derives from [[Latin]], and means \"those that flee from the sun\".

Their [[common name]]s include camel spider, wind scorpion, scorpion carrier, jerrymunglum,<ref>Skaife, Sydney Harold; South African Nature Notes, Second edition.

The [[William Enston Home]], a planned community for the city's aged and infirm, was built in 1889. An elaborate public building, the United States Post Office and Courthouse, was completed by the federal government in 1896 in the heart of the city. The Democrat-dominated state legislature passed a new constitution in 1895 that [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised blacks]], effectively excluding them entirely from the political process, a second-class status that was maintained for more than six decades in a state that was majority-black until about 1930.\n\nCharleston's tourism boom began in earnest following the publication of [[Albert Simons]] and [[Samuel Lapham VI|Samuel Lapham]]'s ''Architecture of Charleston''<ref>{{citation |last=Simons |first=Albert |last2=Lapham |first2=Samuel VI |ref={{harvid|Simons & al.|1927}} |publisher=Press of the American Institute of Architects |title=Charleston, S.C. |series=The Octagon ''Library of Early American Architecture'', Vol. I |date=1927}}.</ref> in the 1920s.<ref>{{citation |last=Horton |first=Tom |title=History's Lost Moments, ''Vol. V'' |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=thPUBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA182 182] |date=2014 |publisher=Trafford |location= |contribution=Touring Charleston Back in 1912}}</ref>\n\n===Contemporary era (1945\u2013present)===\n[[File:PHOTOGRAMMETRIC IMAGE- SOUTH FRONT ELEVATION, INCLUDES -28 SOUTH BATTERY - James E.

Its story is recounted in [[Tom Dent]]'s book ''Southern Journey'' (1996).\n\n[[Joseph P. Riley Jr.]] was elected mayor in the 1970s, and helped advance several cultural aspects of the city. Riley worked to revive Charleston's economic and cultural heritage. The last 30 years of the 20th century had major new investments in the city, with a number of municipal improvements and a commitment to historic preservation to restore the city's unique fabric. There was an effort to preserve working-class housing of African Americans on the historic peninsula, but the neighborhood has gentrified, with rising prices and rents. From 1980 to 2010, the peninsula's population has shifted from two-thirds black to two-thirds white; in 2010 residents numbered 20,668 whites to 10,455 blacks.<ref name=\"slade\">[http://www.postandcourier.com/news/racial-shift-charleston-peninsula-s-makeup-reverses-in-years-with/article_69581977-ef00-5f6c-b969-edb7104344bb.html David Slade, \"RACIAL SHIFT: Charleston peninsula's makeup reverses in 30 years, with blacks leaving for suburbs, area becoming two-thirds white\"], ''The Post and Courier'', 28 March 2011; accessed 10 November 2016</ref> Many African Americans have moved to the less-expensive suburbs in these decades.<ref name=\"slade\"/>\n\nThe city's commitments to investment were not slowed down by Hurricane Hugo and continue to this day. The eye of Hurricane Hugo came ashore at Charleston Harbor in 1989, and though the worst damage was in nearby [[McClellanville, South Carolina|McClellanville]], three-quarters of the homes in Charleston's historic district sustained damage of varying degrees.

Modern Language Association of America, Vol. iii, Internet Archive and Early Journal Content on JSTOR, accessed 5 November 2014</ref> and \"The Huguenot Element in Charleston's Provincialisms\", published in a German journal. He believed the accent was based on the English as it was spoken by the earliest settlers, therefore derived from Elizabethan England and preserved with modifications by Charleston speakers. The  disappearing \"Charleston accent\" spoken mainly by older natives is still noted in the local pronunciation of the city's name. Many Charleston natives ignore the 'r' and elongate the first vowel, pronouncing the name as \"Chah-l-ston\".\n\n===Religion===\nCharleston is known as \"The Holy City.\" Despite beliefs that the term dates to the city's earliest days and refers to its religiously tolerant culture, the term was coined in the 20th century, likely as a mockery of Charlestonians' self-satisfied attitude about their city.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gilbreth |first1=Edward M. |title=Research says 'Holy City' term not church-based |work=Post and Courier |date=May 25, 2016 |location=Charleston, South Carolina}}</ref> Regardless of the nickname's origination, residents have embraced the term and explained it in more flattering terms.\n\nThe Anglican church was dominant in the colonial era, and the [[Cathedral of St. Luke and St. Paul (Charleston, South Carolina)|Cathedral of St. Luke and St. Paul]] is today the seat of the [[Anglican Diocese of South Carolina]].

In turn, the music of Charleston has had an influence on that of the rest of the country. The [[geechee]] dances that accompanied the music of the dock workers in Charleston followed a rhythm that inspired [[Eubie Blake]]'s \"Charleston Rag\" and later [[James P. Johnson]]'s \"[[Charleston (song)|Charleston]]\", as well as the [[Charleston (dance)|dance craze]] that defined a nation in the 1920s. \"[[Ballin' the Jack]]\", which was a popular dance in the years before \"Charleston\", was written by native Charlestonian [[Chris Smith (composer)|Chris Smith]].<ref>{{cite book|last=McCray|first=Jack|title=Charleston Jazz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5hsWQcCvUTkC&pg=PA25|date=June 6, 2007|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-4350-5|pages=11, 12}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Jenkins Orphanage]] was established in 1891 by the Rev. Daniel J. Jenkins in Charleston. The orphanage accepted donations of musical instruments and Rev. Jenkins hired local Charleston musicians and Avery Institute Graduates to tutor the boys in music.

George Gershwin and Heyward spent the summer of 1934 at [[Folly Beach]] outside of Charleston writing this \"folk opera\", as Gershwin called it.

Charleston adopted its present spelling with its incorporation as a [[City (United States)|city]] in 1783 at the close of the [[American Revolution|Revolutionary War]].

It raged until noon the next day, damaging over 1,000 buildings, a loss estimated at $3 million at the time. In efforts to put the fire out, all the water in the city pumps was used up. The fire ruined businesses, several churches, a new theater, and the entire market except for the fish section. Most famously, Charleston's Trinity Church was burned. Another important building that fell victim was the new hotel that had been recently built. Many houses were burnt to the ground. The damaged buildings amounted to about one-fourth of all the businesses in the main part of the city. The fire rendered penniless many who were wealthy. Several prominent store owners died attempting to save their establishments. When the many homes and business were rebuilt or repaired, a great cultural awakening occurred. In many ways, the fire helped put Charleston on the map as a great cultural and architectural center. Previous to the fire, only a few homes were styled as Greek Revival; many residents decided to construct new buildings in that style after the conflagration. This tradition continued and made Charleston one of the foremost places to view [[Greek Revival]] architecture. The [[Gothic Revival]] also made a significant appearance in the construction of many churches after the fire that exhibited picturesque forms and reminders of devout European religion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://historyengine.richmond.edu/episodes/view/3531 |title=History Engine: Tools for Collaborative Education and Research &#124; Episodes |website=Historyengine.richmond.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-05-30}}</ref>\n\nBy 1840, the Market Hall and Sheds, where fresh meat and produce were brought daily, became a hub of commercial activity. The [[slave trade]] also depended on the port of Charleston, where ships could be unloaded and the slaves bought and sold. The legal importation of African slaves had ended in 1808, although smuggling was significant. However, the domestic trade was booming. More than one million slaves were transported from the [[Upland South|Upper South]] to the [[Deep South]] in the antebellum years, as cotton plantations were widely developed through what became known as the [[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Black Belt]].

The last 30 years of the 20th century had major new investments in the city, with a number of municipal improvements and a commitment to historic preservation to restore the city's unique fabric. There was an effort to preserve working-class housing of African Americans on the historic peninsula, but the neighborhood has gentrified, with rising prices and rents.

Today, Gullah is still spoken by many African American residents.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} However, rapid development since 1980, especially on the surrounding Sea Islands, has attracted residents from outside the area and led to a decline in Gullah's prominence.\n\nThe traditional educated Charleston accent has long been noted in the state and throughout the South. It is typically heard in wealthy white older people who trace their families back generations in the city. It has ingliding or monophthongal long mid-vowels, raises ''ay'' and ''aw'' in certain environments, and is [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|nonrhotic]]. [[Sylvester Primer]] of the [[College of Charleston]] wrote about aspects of the local dialect in his late 19th-century works: \"Charleston Provincialisms\" (1887) <ref name=\"primer\">[https://archive.org/details/jstor-456019 \"Charleston Provincialisms\" (1887)], Pub. Modern Language Association of America, Vol. iii, Internet Archive and Early Journal Content on JSTOR, accessed 5 November 2014</ref> and \"The Huguenot Element in Charleston's Provincialisms\", published in a German journal. He believed the accent was based on the English as it was spoken by the earliest settlers, therefore derived from Elizabethan England and preserved with modifications by Charleston speakers. The  disappearing \"Charleston accent\" spoken mainly by older natives is still noted in the local pronunciation of the city's name. Many Charleston natives ignore the 'r' and elongate the first vowel, pronouncing the name as \"Chah-l-ston\".\n\n===Religion===\nCharleston is known as \"The Holy City.\" Despite beliefs that the term dates to the city's earliest days and refers to its religiously tolerant culture, the term was coined in the 20th century, likely as a mockery of Charlestonians' self-satisfied attitude about their city.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gilbreth |first1=Edward M. |title=Research says 'Holy City' term not church-based |work=Post and Courier |date=May 25, 2016 |location=Charleston, South Carolina}}</ref> Regardless of the nickname's origination, residents have embraced the term and explained it in more flattering terms.\n\nThe Anglican church was dominant in the colonial era, and the [[Cathedral of St. Luke and St. Paul (Charleston, South Carolina)|Cathedral of St. Luke and St. Paul]] is today the seat of the [[Anglican Diocese of South Carolina]].

A variety of performing arts venues includes the historic [[Dock Street Theatre]]. The annual Charleston Fashion Week held each spring in Marion Square brings in designers, journalists, and clients from across the nation. Charleston is known for its local seafood, which plays a key role in the city's renowned cuisine, comprising staple dishes such as [[gumbo]], she-crab soup, fried oysters, Lowcountry boil, deviled crab cakes, red rice, and shrimp and grits. Rice is the staple in many dishes, reflecting the rice culture of the Low Country.

The [[geechee]] dances that accompanied the music of the dock workers in Charleston followed a rhythm that inspired [[Eubie Blake]]'s \"Charleston Rag\" and later [[James P. Johnson]]'s \"[[Charleston (song)|Charleston]]\", as well as the [[Charleston (dance)|dance craze]] that defined a nation in the 1920s. \"[[Ballin' the Jack]]\", which was a popular dance in the years before \"Charleston\", was written by native Charlestonian [[Chris Smith (composer)|Chris Smith]].<ref>{{cite book|last=McCray|first=Jack|title=Charleston Jazz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5hsWQcCvUTkC&pg=PA25|date=June 6, 2007|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-4350-5|pages=11, 12}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Jenkins Orphanage]] was established in 1891 by the Rev.

[[Bishop England]], [[Porter-Gaud School]], and [[Ashley Hall (school)|Ashley Hall]] are the city's oldest and most prominent private schools, and are a significant part of Charleston history, dating back some 150 years.\n\nPublic institutions of higher education in Charleston include the [[College of Charleston]] (the nation's 13th-oldest university), [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina]], and the [[Medical University of South Carolina]]. The city is also home to private universities, including the [[Charleston School of Law]]. Charleston is also home to the Roper Hospital School of Practical Nursing, and the city has a downtown satellite campus for the region's technical school, [[Trident Technical College]]. Charleston is also the location for the only college in the country that offers bachelor's degrees in the building arts, The [[American College of the Building Arts]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.buildingartscollege.us/ |title=Welcome \u2013 American College of the Building Arts in Charleston, SC |website=Buildingartscollege.us |date=2016-07-12 |accessdate=2017-05-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217013414/http://buildingartscollege.us/ |archive-date=February 17, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[The Art Institute of Charleston]], located downtown on North Market Street, opened in 2007.\nHigher education includes institutions such as the Medical University of South Carolina, College of Charleston, The Citadel, and [[Charleston School of Law]]. \nIn addition, there are two universities in North Charleston. [[Charleston Southern University]] is located in nearby North Charleston. Also, Clemson University has a branch campus focused on graduate education, electric power and wind turbine research, and restoration of the H.L. Hunley submarine.\n\n==Armed Forces==\nCharleston, North Charleston, Goose Creek, and Hanahan are home to branches of the United States military. During the [[Cold War]], the [[Charleston Naval Shipyard|Naval Base]] (1902\u20131996) became the third largest U.S. homeport, with 23,500 [[United States Navy|Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] personnel, and 13,200 civilians serving over 80 ships and submarines. In addition, the combined facilities of the Naval Base and Weapons Station created the largest U.S. submarine port.  The [[Charleston Naval Shipyard]] repaired frigates, destroyers, cruisers, submarine tenders, and submarines. Also during this period, the shipyard conducted refueling of nuclear submarines.\n\nThe Weapons Station was the Atlantic Fleet's loadout base for all nuclear [[ballistic missile submarine]]s. Two SSBN \"Boomer\" squadrons and a submarine tender were homeported at the Weapons Station, while one SSN attack squadron, [[Submarine Squadron 4]], and a submarine tender were homeported at the Naval Base. At the 1996 closure of the station's Polaris Missile Facility Atlantic (POMFLANT), over 2,500 nuclear warheads and their [[UGM-27 Polaris]], [[UGM-73 Poseidon]], and [[UGM-96 Trident I]] delivery missiles ([[SLBM]]) were stored and maintained, guarded by a U.S. Marine Corps security force company.\n\nIn 2010, the Air Force base (3,877 acres) and Naval Weapons Station (>17,000 acres) merged to form [[Joint Base Charleston]]. Today, Joint Base Charleston, supporting 53 military commands and federal agencies, provides service to over 79,000 airmen, sailors, soldiers, Marines, [[United States Coast Guard|coast guardsmen]], Department of Defense civilians, dependents, and retirees.\n\n===Army===\n*[[United States Army Corps of Engineers]], Charleston District\n\n==Media==\n{{Main|Media in Charleston, South Carolina}}\n\n===Broadcast television===\nCharleston is the nation's 98th-largest [[media market|Designated market area (DMA)]], with 312,770 households and 0.27% of the U.S. TV population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/news/business|title= Charleston drops in TV market pecking order}}</ref> These stations are licensed in Charleston and have significant operations or viewers in the city:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvstations.procontentanddesign.com/browse/city/185_Charleston_SC.htm|title=Television station listings in Charleston, South Carolina \u2013 Total station FCC filings found|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715120014/http://tvstations.procontentanddesign.com/browse/city/185_Charleston_SC.htm|archivedate=July 15, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n* [[WCBD-TV]] (2, [[NBC]]) and (14, [[The CW|CW]])\n* [[WGWG]] (4, [[Heroes & Icons]])\n* [[WCSC-TV]] (5, [[CBS]], [[Bounce TV]], [[Grit (TV network)|Grit]])\n* [[South Carolina Educational Television|WITV]] (7, [[PBS]])\n* [[WLCN-CD]] (18, [[Christian Television Network|CTN]])\n* [[WTAT|WTAT-TV]] (24, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]])\n* WAZS-CD (29, [[Azteca America]] Independent)\n* WJNI-CD (31, [[America One]] Independent)\n* [[WCIV]] (36, [[MyNetworkTV]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[MeTV]])\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Main|List of people from Charleston, South Carolina}}\n<!-- Please respect alphabetical order by last name -->\n* [[Herman Baer]], author\n* [[Frances Elizabeth Barrow]], children's writer\n* [[Solomon Nunes Carvalho]], painter and photographer\n* [[Mo Brooks]], U.S. Representative\n* [[Mark Catesby]], English naturalist and author\n* [[Catherine Coleman]], chemist, US Air Force officer, and astronaut\n* [[Stephen Colbert]], comedian and host of ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert|The Late Show]]''\n* [[Andy Dick]], actor\n* [[Shepard Fairey]], graffiti artist\n* [[Mamie Garvin Fields]] (1888\u20131987), teacher and civil rights activist\n* [[Robert F.

The series takes place in an alternative 21st-century Britain.\n\nAt the time of the series, slavery had been abolished for some time, but segregation, similar to [[Jim Crow laws|the Jim Crow Laws,]] continues to operate to keep the crosses (dark-skinned people) in control of the noughts (lighter-skinned people). An international organisation, the Pangaean Economic Community, exists. Seeming to be similar to the [[United Nations]] in scope but similar to the [[European Union]] in powers, it is playing a role in forcing change by directives and boycotts.\n\nThe book is written from two different perspectives - Callum\u2019s and Sephy\u2019s (Persephone) - and their experiences of their entwined but very different worlds. The chapters alternate, with even chapters being Callum\u2019s and odd ones Sephy\u2019s.\n\nThere are five books in the series- Noughts and crosses, knife edge, checkmate, double cross and cross fire.\n== Novels ==\n\n===''Noughts & Crosses''===\n{{Infobox book\n| name = Noughts & Crosses\n| author = [[Malorie Blackman]]\n| language = English\n| country = Britain\n| genre = [[Action (fiction)|Action]], [[Adventure fiction|Adventure]], [[Romance novel|Romance]]\n| publisher = [[Random House]]\n| isbn = 978-0-385-60008-8\n| image = \n| caption = Noughts & Crosses Front Cover\n| illustrator = \n| cover_artist = \n| series = Noughts & Crosses saga\n| subject = Forbidden Love, Racism, Political Terrorism\n| pub_date = 2001\n| media_type = Book\n| pages = 454 p.\n| oclc = 45592902\n| preceded_by = \n| followed_by = [[Noughts & Crosses series#Knife Edge|Knife Edge]]\n}}\nThe book ''Noughts and Crosses'' is a dystopian fiction based in a 21st-century parallel universe. Their world, technologically at least, is similar to the one we live in today: about the same jobs, same type of government etc. But there is one key difference: equality between races is lacking and there aren\u2019t many laws or constitutions to protect from discrimination. There are two races in the book: the Crosses (darker-skinned people who we in our current universe would call \u2018Black\u2019) the superior race with the individuals owning most of the wealth, good jobs different and better schools etc.  The second race, the noughts (lighter-skinned people who we would refer to as \"white\") are at the poorer end of society usually doing manual labour or being servant to Crosses, with poor schools \u2013 if any at all.\n\nSephy (full name Persephone) Hadley is a Cross. She is the daughter of a wealthy senior politician, Kamal Hadley, who later takes office as Prime Minister. Callum McGregor is a nought. They used to play together when Jasmine, Sephy's mother, employed Meggie McGregor, Callum's mother, as a nanny. However, Jasmine fired Meggie for being unable to provide an alibi for her when Kamal confronts Jasmine about his suspicions of her infidelity: that is only strongly suggested for now but is made explicit later. Since then, Sephy and Callum's friendship has been secret, as such interracial friendships are frowned upon by society.\n\nCallum is one of the first few noughts to start at Heathcroft, a high school for  Crosses that now accepts the best-performing noughts. Sephy is overjoyed to find that Callum is in her class after helping him pass the entrance examination. However, most of her classmates do not accept her association with a nought. The two develop a more intimate connection, and Sephy does not care about the opposition and even sits at a table with noughts. That angers Callum, but the two make up.\n\nMeanwhile, Callum's elder brother, Jude, and his father, Ryan, join the Liberation Militia (LM), a violent paramilitary organisation against Cross supremacy. Jasmine becomes an alcoholic.\n\nCallum's troubled elder sister, Lynette, commits suicide by throwing herself in front of a bus. Only Callum knows that it was suicide, as Lynette had left him a secret note that talks of her depression after an attack on her and her Cross boyfriend. Everyone else thinks that it was a tragic accident, despite all of her previous suicide attempts.\n\nJude and Ryan are accused of lethally bombing Dundale Shopping Centre, which was committed by the LM. Callum is also accused after he tells Sephy to get out of the shopping centre but is released due to lack of evidence. Callum has to leave school, and Ryan faces the gallows. Jasmine, remembering that she used to be friends with the McGregor family, secretly hires a prominent Cross lawyer to defend Ryan. Escaping hanging, Ryan is given a life sentence but is killed by an [[electric fence]], supposedly in an escape attempt.\n\nSephy decides to start anew and persuades a reluctant Jasmine to let her attend a [[boarding school]], Chivers. Sephy has not heard from Callum for a week so she writes him a letter asking him to run away with her and telling him that she will be leaving for Chivers if he does not contact her. However, Callum has decided to join the LM, against the wishes of his mother, and he does not read the letter until just before Sephy leaves. Callum sprints to Sephy's house and fails to catch up with the car as it pulls out of the driveway. Having not seen Callum running behind, Sephy concludes that their friendship is no longer as important to him as she had thought.\n\nYears later, Sephy returns home from Chivers. She enters the house and discovers that Callum had left her a letter telling her to meet him at the family's private beach. Sephy decides to meet up with him but later she finds out that Callum is there with others from the LM to kidnap her and hold her hostage. Jude punches Sephy in the stomach, and the gang members take her to their hideout. The members of the LM deliver a message to Sephy's father, Kamal, to release at least five LM from prison and pay money if he wants to see Sephy alive.\n\nThe LM's second-in-command, Andrew Dorn, visits Callum and his cell members. Andrew informs Kamal of where two of the LM team members are while they are making phone calls. One is killed, and the other is put in jail.\n\nDuring a time alone, Callum visits a hurt Sephy in the room where she is being held. Callum reveals to Sephy that he unsuccessfully tried to catch up with her before she left for Chivers. Their love rekindles and, after Callum whispers that he loves her, they make love. Afterwards, Sephy cannot seem to stop crying, and Jude walks in. He calls Callum an idiot for sleeping with her. \n\nSephy escapes into the woods and is soon chased by Jude and Morgan, the other survivor. Callum finds her and gives false instructions to the others. Callum then gives Sephy instructions to escape. Sephy tells Callum that she had seen Andrew, without knowing his identity, in her house with Kamal, which shows that Andrew is a government [[informer]]. \n\nCallum tells the rest of the gang what Sephy said about Andrew. The members agree to split up and keep a low profile for six months and not meet up again until Callum's birthday.\n\nSephy feels an unusual tummy bug come on. Her sister, Minerva, asks if she is pregnant, which Sephy denies. Sephy takes a pregnancy test, which reveals she is pregnant with Callum's child. Meanwhile, Callum is working as a mechanic, as a cover, and hears Kamal on the radio, denying rumours that his daughter is pregnant. Sephy's parents learn of her pregnancy and pressure her to have an abortion, but Sephy repeatedly refuses.\n\nCallum then meets Sephy in the Hadleys' rose garden. Sephy confirms the rumours, and they decide on names for the child: Ryan, after Callum's father, if it is a boy, and Callie Rose if it is a girl. Callum is found in the garden and is arrested. No one believes Sephy when she maintains that she was not raped. Callum stands trial and is sentenced to be hanged. Kamal tells Sephy that if she keeps her child, Callum will be hanged, but if she has the abortion, he will serve years in prison instead. Kamal makes a similar offer to Callum but also wants Callum to say publicly that he raped her. Both decide to keep the baby.\n\nOn the day of Callum's hanging, he asks his guard, Jack, to deliver a letter to Sephy personally. Callum is then led to the gallows. He fails to find Sephy in the crowd before the hood is put on. He then hears Sephy shouting, 'I love you'. He shouts back, 'I love you too'. Sephy watches the trapdoor open and sees Callum's limp, lifeless body hanging from the noose. She hears Callum shouting to her but is unsure if she heard the word 'too' so she cannot be sure that Callum heard her.\n\nThe story ends with a newspaper cutting announcing the birth of their child, Callie Rose, with an announcement from Sephy that her daughter will take her father's surname of McGregor. (However, in later books, it is revealed that Sephy changes her mind so that Callie Rose can grow up without knowing her father's role in the LM.)\n\n===''Knife Edge''===\n{{Infobox book\n| name = Knife Edge\n| image = \n| caption = Knife Edge Front Cover\n| author = [[Malorie Blackman]]\n| illustrator = \n| cover_artist = \n| country = United Kingdom\n| language = English\n| series = Noughts & Crosses Saga\n| subject = \n| genre = [[Young adult fiction]]\n| publisher = [[Random House]]\n| pub_date = 5 February 2004\n| media_type = \n| pages = 449 p.\n| isbn = 978-0-385-60527-4\n| oclc = \n| preceded_by = [[Noughts & Crosses series#Noughts & Crosses|Noughts & Crosses]]\n| followed_by = [[Noughts & Crosses series#Checkmate|Checkmate]]\n}}\nSephy is a cross, the privileged group in society, but Callum, the father of her child, was a nought. Callum's brother, Jude, blames Sephy for the terrible losses his family has suffered and is determined to destroy Sephy's life by any means necessary. He meets Cara Imega, a cross, and befriends her to access her money.\n\nSephy, living with Callum's mother, Meggie, becomes increasingly fond of her daughter, Callie Rose. Callum's guard, Jack, delivers a letter, written by Callum before he died, saying that he never loved her and could not believe that she was stupid enough to fall for him. Meggie tries to make Sephy believe that Callum was forced to write the letter by the rest of the gang, but the letter is so hurtful that Sephy believes it and develops [[postnatal depression]]. She meets Jaxon, a hot-tempered man with a band, the Midges. He offers Sephy a singing part, but the noughts are prejudiced against her because she is a cross. She begins to neglect Callie Rose.\n\nCara spends a lot of time with Jude. Although he loathes Crosses, he begins to fall in love with her. Frustrated and confused with his feelings for a cross, Jude beats her severely and runs off with a large amount of money. After she dies in hospital, Jude is eventually arrested and charged with Cara's murder. He is virtually certain to get the death sentence since his fingerprints are all over her apartment and had been seen with her by several witnesses.\n\nSephy struggles with seeing Meggie losing the last remaining member of her family. Sephy decides, for Meggie's sake, to give Jude a false [[alibi]] for Cara's death. That works, and after serving a few months in prison for LM membership, Jude accuses LM second-in-command Andrew Dorn of Cara's murder and claims Dorn is a government informer; Andrew is soon shot dead by the LM. Jude, even though Sephy saved his miserable life, still holds his grudge against her and plots a terrible revenge.\n\nSephy's life begins to fall apart. The crosses hate her because she helped Jude escape the noose, the noughts because she did not come to his aid sooner. She hugs her daughter too tightly while she sing the famous song \"Rainbow Child\". Callie Rose stops breathing, and Meggie screams at Sephy, \"What have you done?\"\n\n===''Checkmate''===\n{{Infobox book\n| name = Checkmate\n| image = \n| caption = Checkmate Front Cover\n| author = [[Malorie Blackman]]\n| illustrator = \n| cover_artist = \n| country = United Kingdom\n| language = English\n| series = Noughts & Crosses Saga\n| subject = \n| genre = [[Young adult fiction]]\n| publisher = [[Random House]]\n| pub_date = 30 June 2005\n| media_type = \n| pages = 511 p.\n| isbn = 978-0-385-60773-5\n| oclc = \n| preceded_by = [[Noughts & Crosses series#Knife Edge|Knife Edge]]\n| followed_by = [[Noughts & Crosses series#Double Cross|Double Cross]]\n}}\n\nCallie Rose struggles with growing up as half-nought and half-cross after she learns the truth about her nought father's life from her friend, Tobey, who calls her a terrorist's daughter. Callie Rose had been told by her mother that her father, Callum, had been a gardener who died in an accident. Callie Rose becomes angry with her mother, Sephy, for hiding the truth. She decides to follow the path of her father. She also cuts off her friendship with nought Tobey despite his attempts to apologise.\n\nSephy feels trapped and rejects an offer of marriage from her boyfriend, Sonny. She meets Nathan, the owner of the restaurant in which she sings, and the two start a relationship.\n\nJude takes Callie Rose to Kamal's house. After Kamal denies that she is his granddaughter, Jude, now the General of the LM, exploits her anger to groom her to become a suicide bomber.\n \nCallie Rose starts dating Lucas, a cross who is an ex-friend's brother. Jasmine, Sephy's mother, does what she can to bring Callie and Sephy closer together but develops [[breast cancer]] and struggles with her life. Nathan proposes to Sephy, who accepts, but Sonny shows up in her life again. Sephy is left confused but engaged.\n\nCeline Lubanjah, the daughter of Callum's prison guard Jack, gives a letter that was written by Callum before he was hanged. Callum told Jack this is the letter with his real feelings. Callum says in the letter he greatly wishes that he had been able to stay with Sephy, as he loved her so much. He also tells Sephy to keep his past secret from their child.\n\nSephy and Callie Rose resume their relationship after Jasmine traps them in her wine cellar so that they sort things out. Jasmine sets off the bomb to prevent Jude from injuring anyone else. Kamal had been the intended target of the bomb, but he only loses power, after Jasmine had sent a letter to the press about his rampant corruption.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===''Double Cross''===\n{{Infobox book\n| name = Double Cross\n| image = \n| caption = Double Cross Front Cover\n| author = [[Malorie Blackman]]\n| illustrator = \n| cover_artist = \n| country = United Kingdom\n| language = English\n| series = Noughts & Crosses Saga\n| subject = \n| genre = [[Young adult fiction]]\n| publisher = [[Random House]]\n| pub_date = November 2008\n| media_type = \n| pages = \n| isbn = 978-0-385-61551-8\n| oclc = \n| preceded_by = [[Noughts & Crosses series#Checkmate|Checkmate]]\n| followed_by = [[Noughts & Crosses series#Crossfire|Crossfire]]\n}}\n\nKamal's party loses the election badly to a more liberal government. Callie Rose knows secretly that she made the bomb that killed Jasmine and that it was intended for Jasmine's ex-husband, Kamal. Callie Rose also fears that Jude, her uncle, is still alive since he is known for serving revenge cold. The press fails to mention Jude in connection to the bomb but notes the death of Robert Powers.\n\nCallie Rose's best friend and later boyfriend, Tobey, is worried about his own future. As a Nought boy at an exclusive school, Tobey hopes to keep out of trouble, go to university, get a good job and leave behind the dangerous streets of his childhood. However, he cannot keep clinging to some kind of no-man's land while the neighbourhood around him is carved up by rival gangs, one headed by a ruthless man, Alex McAuley, the head of a gang of Noughts, and another headed by the Dowds, the head of a gang of Crosses. Both are powerful gangs that frequently injure and kill each other's members as well as suspected informants.\n\nTobey is offered the chance to earn some ready money just making a few 'deliveries' after he is introduced by a friend, Dan, who works for McAuley. Tobey wants no part of the world of gangs but makes an exception for once. \n\nTobey finds out that the delivery was the little finger of one of the Dowds, a manager at the restaurant. He keeps the secret from his girlfriend Callie Rose. They start kissing and touching each other. Callie Rose asks Tobey if he is ready. They make love. Callie Rose then leaves but promises to meet Tobey again.\n\nThe next day, when Dan, Tobey and Callie Rose get together, Callie Rose is shot by a hail of bullets from McAuley. Her surgery is successful, but she ends up in coma. Sephy is furious at Tobey for not becoming more of a man and telling the police who shot Callie Rose. Sephy does not know that Tobey has sworn revenge on McAuley and plans on doing so 'himself'.\n\nWhile Callie Rose is in hospital, Tobey gets a new job at TFTM (Thanks for the Memories), the Dowds' restaurant. He meets Rebecca, Vanessa Dowd's daughter. Rebecca loves his company, as he treats her like a person, unlike other boys, who are interested only in her family and money. Tobey eventually goes out with her but is confused between her and Callie Rose.\n\nCallie Rose wakes from her coma and finds out that Robert Powers was a false identity of Jude, who thus was certainly killed by the bomb. However, she learns that Tobey is dating Rebecca and that she had been in a coma for so long.\n\nDuring a visit to Vanessa Dowd's house, Tobey is revealed to have been making deliveries for McAuley. Rebecca is shocked, but Tobey reassures her that he does not work for him any longer. However, he decides to end their relationship and become merely 'friends'. When Rebecca leaves, McAuley appears and stabs her. He then orders Tobey to meet him at his warehouse.\n\nTobey knows that McAuley wants to kill him, but a plan is set up with Owen Dowd, Rebecca's brother. He puts a great deal of money in Byron Sweet, one of McAuley's minions, to frame him as a traitor. He goes to the warehouse and successfully executes his plan. However, he is almost killed by two more of McAuley's minions. Luckily, Dan appears from nowhere and kills the two minions outside and McAuley, saving Tobey's life. Dan ends up on the run.\n\nJasmine, in her will, gives both houses, including the beach, to Sephy. She also gives sums to Meggie (to whom she writes a letter of apology), Callie Rose, Minerva, Zuri, Taj and Sarah.\n\nTobey tells Callie that he is responsible for the deaths of five people (Rebecca Dowd, Bryon Sweet, Alex McAuley and minions Dave and Scott) and that Dan is on the run. Callie then points out that Jasmine and Jude died because of her. They eventually resume their relationship and admit their love.\n\nIn the epilogue, it is revealed that both Callie and Tobey go to university to study law and that Tobey has set up and helps fund the Meadowview Shelter to help those with drug and alcohol addictions.\n\n===''Crossfire''===\n\nThe fifth book in the series, ''Crossfire'', was published on 8 August 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/1000253/malorie-blackman.html|title=Malorie Blackman|website=penguin|access-date=12 May 2019}}</ref> Part of the book picks up months after ''Double Cross'' on Callie's birthday, exactly one year after ''Checkmate''; the rest occurs eighteen years later. Callie Rose and Tobey return as protagonists, while Callie's half-brother Troy Ealing and Tobey's daughter Libby Jackman are introduced. The plot focuses on Troy and Libby being kidnapped by masked assailants, with flashbacks illustrating their backstory, filling in the gaps between ''Double Cross'' and ''Crossfire'', and revealing the abductors' identities. The story ends on a cliffhanger, indicating an upcoming sixth instalment.\n\nTobey's guilt over Rebecca's death and his belief that he no longer deserves Callie Rose leads him to estrange himself from her, but they reunite months later. Sephy and Nathan marry, and she is pregnant with a son, Troy, by Callie Rose's next birthday. During the party Tobey and Callie Rose have a huge argument over his continued secrecy regarding the details of his involvement in McAuley's death, and he has an affair with classmate Misty Jackman, ending his and Callie Rose's relationship for good. Misty becomes pregnant and gives birth to Tobey's daughter Libby, and he attempts to have a relationship with her for their child's sake, but it soon collapses. In his resultant depression Tobey briefly joins Nought Forever, the Liberation Militia's spiritual successor, but soon quits. Callie Rose attends law school and later works for prominent lawyer Solomon Camden, becoming one of the best barristers in the country.\n\nTobey pursues a career in politics and is aided and bankrolled by Dan Jeavons, now a powerful gangster. He uses his growing fortune to financially support Misty and Libby, but Misty refuses to let him see their daughter, conceals his identity from Libby, and gradually spends Libby's entire trust fund. She becomes an alcohol and drug addict, and abuses Libby, who struggles with anxiety and begins self-harming. Troy and Libby become friends, but after a brief romance, their relationship sours and they become bitter rivals. Nathan is killed in a hit-and-run, leaving Sephy and Troy devastated. Over the next two years Sonny returns to Sephy's life and they resume their relationship, but Troy discovers what appears to be the same car that killed Nathan on Sonny's land, leaving him convinced that Sonny murdered his father.\n\nFinally learning her father's identity, Libby disowns Misty and contacts Tobey. With Dan's help Tobey is elected as the first Nought Prime Minister, but Dan is later murdered at a party attended by Tobey, Sephy and Owen Dowd, amongst others. Tobey is arrested for the crime and enlists Callie Rose to defend him, and they later have an ill-advised one-night stand, but she is repulsed to learn of his past affiliation with Nought Forever. When she threatens to drop him as a client, he blackmails her into continuing to defend him by threatening to reveal their affair to her employers. Unwilling to lose the money Tobey has been supplying her as a result of the rift between her and Libby, Misty helps several of Dan's former enforcers abduct Libby and Troy, holding them hostage. The other kidnappers murder a masked Misty when Libby deduces her identity, and they demand that Callie Rose drop Tobey as a client and that he plead guilty. In an effort to get Callie Rose to comply with the kidnappers' demands, Tobey tells her that Sephy murdered Dan, and that he covered for her by planting evidence to make himself appear guilty. Despite this revelation and the danger to Libby and Troy, Callie Rose continues to defend Tobey, who pleads his innocence as the trial begins. In response the kidnappers decide to leave Libby and Troy to die, sealing them in their cellar prison.\n\n== Novellas ==\n\n===''Callum''===\nThe novella changes the ending of ''Noughts and Crosses'' and was published for [[World Book Day]] 2012. \n\nCallum decides to let Sephy flee from the other kidnappers while they are out. While he shows her the way back to town, Sephy badly injures her foot. He talks her into spending the night with her in an abandoned shack for her to recover. There, they argue but then realise their mutual love. They decide to run away together. They fall asleep after making love.\n\nThe two are surprised by the rest of the gang. Jude and Callum point their guns at each other. Sephy takes advantage of the confusion to flee. Jude and Callum point their guns at each other, and the story ends as a [[cliffhanger]].\n\n===''An Eye For an Eye''===\nThe novella gives an insight into the events of ''Knife Edge''. Written for World Book Day 2003, it has been republished in a new edition of ''Noughts & Crosses''. ''An Eye For an Eye'' describes one evening while Sephy is pregnant with Callie Rose when her sister, Minerva, visits her. Minerva offers to patch up things with Jasmine, but Sephy tries to get Minerva to leave. As Sephy had feared after being followed by Jude for a few days, he arrives, planning to murder Sephy.\n\nJude, Callum's older brother, watches Sephy enter her apartment building, and he plans to kill her. However, he does not know that Minerva is also in Sephy's apartment.\n\nSephy tells Jude that she knew that he intended to kill her just before midnight since it was Callum's birthday that day. Jude feels that Sephy is responsible for Callum's death and wants to make sure that Sephy will not see Callum's next birthday since Callum had not seen his next birthday. Sephy is not alarmed and does not protest, but Minerva panics. Sephy tells Jude that he would be doing her a favour by killing her and wants to die because she misses Callum. When Minerva tries to change her mind, Sephy declares that she hates the baby because it was alive and that Callum should be alive instead. That is a lie, and Sephy later threatens to kill Jude if he ever hurts her child.\n\nSephy begins to provoke Jude by saying that she and Callum loved each other and Kamal offered her a choice of keeping the baby and letting Callum be hanged or getting an abortion and saving his life. Jude loses his temper and tries to shoot Sephy, but his gun jams. Minerva, in an attempt to save Sephy and herself, runs towards the front door and screams to attract attention. That fails, and Jude shoots her in the shoulder. Jude realises that Sephy wants to die. He decides that since killing her would only do her a favour, he will make her suffer instead.\n\nJude gives Sephy permission to call an ambulance for Minerva and tells her that he knows she cares about her sister and her family, especially her child. He then tells her that he plans to use her baby to hurt her. Sephy threatens to kill him if he hurts her child, but she later pleads with Jude to leave both of them alone. Jude leaves just as the ambulance arrives, with a new plan in mind. Sephy makes Minerva lie about her injuries.\n\n===''Nought Forever''===\nA World Book Day release in 2019, and a prequel to ''Crossfire''. Following on from the events of ''Double Cross'', a fugitive Dan is mortally wounded by McAuley's former enforcers, and is forced to hide out with a nurse, Eva, whose daughter Avalon committed suicide three years earlier after being drawn into drug addiction and prostitution by McAuley. Though she hides Dan from the criminals hunting him, Eva debates whether to continue sheltering him or turn him in to the police. The novella concludes without revealing the outcome of her decision, but ''Crossfire'' suggests that Eva continued to hide Dan but ultimately convinced him to turn himself in, and remained a friend and mother figure to him during his imprisonment and his later career as a gangster.\n\n==Characters==\nThe characters from all books from the series are as follows:\n\n===Primary characters===\n*Persephone Mira Hadley: the co-protagonist of ''Noughts & Crosses'' and ''Knife Edge'', and a supporting character in ''Checkmate'' and ''Double Cross''.

2020}}\n\n'''''Noughts & Crosses''''' is a series of [[young adult novels|young adult]] [[novel]]s by English author [[Malorie Blackman]], including five [[novella]]s.\nThe series is [[speculative fiction]] describing an [[alternative history]] in which native [[Africa]]n people had colonised the [[ethnic groups in Europe|European people]], rather than the other way around, with Africans having made Europeans their slaves. The series takes place in an alternative 21st-century Britain.\n\nAt the time of the series, slavery had been abolished for some time, but segregation, similar to [[Jim Crow laws|the Jim Crow Laws,]] continues to operate to keep the crosses (dark-skinned people) in control of the noughts (lighter-skinned people). An international organisation, the Pangaean Economic Community, exists. Seeming to be similar to the [[United Nations]] in scope but similar to the [[European Union]] in powers, it is playing a role in forcing change by directives and boycotts.\n\nThe book is written from two different perspectives - Callum\u2019s and Sephy\u2019s (Persephone) - and their experiences of their entwined but very different worlds. The chapters alternate, with even chapters being Callum\u2019s and odd ones Sephy\u2019s.\n\nThere are five books in the series- Noughts and crosses, knife edge, checkmate, double cross and cross fire.\n== Novels ==\n\n===''Noughts & Crosses''===\n{{Infobox book\n| name = Noughts & Crosses\n| author = [[Malorie Blackman]]\n| language = English\n| country = Britain\n| genre = [[Action (fiction)|Action]], [[Adventure fiction|Adventure]], [[Romance novel|Romance]]\n| publisher = [[Random House]]\n| isbn = 978-0-385-60008-8\n| image = \n| caption = Noughts & Crosses Front Cover\n| illustrator = \n| cover_artist = \n| series = Noughts & Crosses saga\n| subject = Forbidden Love, Racism, Political Terrorism\n| pub_date = 2001\n| media_type = Book\n| pages = 454 p.\n| oclc = 45592902\n| preceded_by = \n| followed_by = [[Noughts & Crosses series#Knife Edge|Knife Edge]]\n}}\nThe book ''Noughts and Crosses'' is a dystopian fiction based in a 21st-century parallel universe. Their world, technologically at least, is similar to the one we live in today: about the same jobs, same type of government etc. But there is one key difference: equality between races is lacking and there aren\u2019t many laws or constitutions to protect from discrimination. There are two races in the book: the Crosses (darker-skinned people who we in our current universe would call \u2018Black\u2019) the superior race with the individuals owning most of the wealth, good jobs different and better schools etc.  The second race, the noughts (lighter-skinned people who we would refer to as \"white\") are at the poorer end of society usually doing manual labour or being servant to Crosses, with poor schools \u2013 if any at all.\n\nSephy (full name Persephone) Hadley is a Cross. She is the daughter of a wealthy senior politician, Kamal Hadley, who later takes office as Prime Minister. Callum McGregor is a nought. They used to play together when Jasmine, Sephy's mother, employed Meggie McGregor, Callum's mother, as a nanny. However, Jasmine fired Meggie for being unable to provide an alibi for her when Kamal confronts Jasmine about his suspicions of her infidelity: that is only strongly suggested for now but is made explicit later. Since then, Sephy and Callum's friendship has been secret, as such interracial friendships are frowned upon by society.\n\nCallum is one of the first few noughts to start at Heathcroft, a high school for  Crosses that now accepts the best-performing noughts. Sephy is overjoyed to find that Callum is in her class after helping him pass the entrance examination. However, most of her classmates do not accept her association with a nought. The two develop a more intimate connection, and Sephy does not care about the opposition and even sits at a table with noughts. That angers Callum, but the two make up.\n\nMeanwhile, Callum's elder brother, Jude, and his father, Ryan, join the Liberation Militia (LM), a violent paramilitary organisation against Cross supremacy. Jasmine becomes an alcoholic.\n\nCallum's troubled elder sister, Lynette, commits suicide by throwing herself in front of a bus. Only Callum knows that it was suicide, as Lynette had left him a secret note that talks of her depression after an attack on her and her Cross boyfriend. Everyone else thinks that it was a tragic accident, despite all of her previous suicide attempts.\n\nJude and Ryan are accused of lethally bombing Dundale Shopping Centre, which was committed by the LM. Callum is also accused after he tells Sephy to get out of the shopping centre but is released due to lack of evidence. Callum has to leave school, and Ryan faces the gallows. Jasmine, remembering that she used to be friends with the McGregor family, secretly hires a prominent Cross lawyer to defend Ryan. Escaping hanging, Ryan is given a life sentence but is killed by an [[electric fence]], supposedly in an escape attempt.\n\nSephy decides to start anew and persuades a reluctant Jasmine to let her attend a [[boarding school]], Chivers. Sephy has not heard from Callum for a week so she writes him a letter asking him to run away with her and telling him that she will be leaving for Chivers if he does not contact her. However, Callum has decided to join the LM, against the wishes of his mother, and he does not read the letter until just before Sephy leaves. Callum sprints to Sephy's house and fails to catch up with the car as it pulls out of the driveway. Having not seen Callum running behind, Sephy concludes that their friendship is no longer as important to him as she had thought.\n\nYears later, Sephy returns home from Chivers. She enters the house and discovers that Callum had left her a letter telling her to meet him at the family's private beach. Sephy decides to meet up with him but later she finds out that Callum is there with others from the LM to kidnap her and hold her hostage. Jude punches Sephy in the stomach, and the gang members take her to their hideout. The members of the LM deliver a message to Sephy's father, Kamal, to release at least five LM from prison and pay money if he wants to see Sephy alive.\n\nThe LM's second-in-command, Andrew Dorn, visits Callum and his cell members. Andrew informs Kamal of where two of the LM team members are while they are making phone calls. One is killed, and the other is put in jail.\n\nDuring a time alone, Callum visits a hurt Sephy in the room where she is being held. Callum reveals to Sephy that he unsuccessfully tried to catch up with her before she left for Chivers. Their love rekindles and, after Callum whispers that he loves her, they make love. Afterwards, Sephy cannot seem to stop crying, and Jude walks in. He calls Callum an idiot for sleeping with her. \n\nSephy escapes into the woods and is soon chased by Jude and Morgan, the other survivor. Callum finds her and gives false instructions to the others. Callum then gives Sephy instructions to escape. Sephy tells Callum that she had seen Andrew, without knowing his identity, in her house with Kamal, which shows that Andrew is a government [[informer]]. \n\nCallum tells the rest of the gang what Sephy said about Andrew. The members agree to split up and keep a low profile for six months and not meet up again until Callum's birthday.\n\nSephy feels an unusual tummy bug come on. Her sister, Minerva, asks if she is pregnant, which Sephy denies. Sephy takes a pregnancy test, which reveals she is pregnant with Callum's child. Meanwhile, Callum is working as a mechanic, as a cover, and hears Kamal on the radio, denying rumours that his daughter is pregnant. Sephy's parents learn of her pregnancy and pressure her to have an abortion, but Sephy repeatedly refuses.\n\nCallum then meets Sephy in the Hadleys' rose garden. Sephy confirms the rumours, and they decide on names for the child: Ryan, after Callum's father, if it is a boy, and Callie Rose if it is a girl. Callum is found in the garden and is arrested. No one believes Sephy when she maintains that she was not raped. Callum stands trial and is sentenced to be hanged. Kamal tells Sephy that if she keeps her child, Callum will be hanged, but if she has the abortion, he will serve years in prison instead. Kamal makes a similar offer to Callum but also wants Callum to say publicly that he raped her. Both decide to keep the baby.\n\nOn the day of Callum's hanging, he asks his guard, Jack, to deliver a letter to Sephy personally. Callum is then led to the gallows. He fails to find Sephy in the crowd before the hood is put on. He then hears Sephy shouting, 'I love you'. He shouts back, 'I love you too'. Sephy watches the trapdoor open and sees Callum's limp, lifeless body hanging from the noose. She hears Callum shouting to her but is unsure if she heard the word 'too' so she cannot be sure that Callum heard her.\n\nThe story ends with a newspaper cutting announcing the birth of their child, Callie Rose, with an announcement from Sephy that her daughter will take her father's surname of McGregor. (However, in later books, it is revealed that Sephy changes her mind so that Callie Rose can grow up without knowing her father's role in the LM.)\n\n===''Knife Edge''===\n{{Infobox book\n| name = Knife Edge\n| image = \n| caption = Knife Edge Front Cover\n| author = [[Malorie Blackman]]\n| illustrator = \n| cover_artist = \n| country = United Kingdom\n| language = English\n| series = Noughts & Crosses Saga\n| subject = \n| genre = [[Young adult fiction]]\n| publisher = [[Random House]]\n| pub_date = 5 February 2004\n| media_type = \n| pages = 449 p.\n| isbn = 978-0-385-60527-4\n| oclc = \n| preceded_by = [[Noughts & Crosses series#Noughts & Crosses|Noughts & Crosses]]\n| followed_by = [[Noughts & Crosses series#Checkmate|Checkmate]]\n}}\nSephy is a cross, the privileged group in society, but Callum, the father of her child, was a nought. Callum's brother, Jude, blames Sephy for the terrible losses his family has suffered and is determined to destroy Sephy's life by any means necessary. He meets Cara Imega, a cross, and befriends her to access her money.\n\nSephy, living with Callum's mother, Meggie, becomes increasingly fond of her daughter, Callie Rose. Callum's guard, Jack, delivers a letter, written by Callum before he died, saying that he never loved her and could not believe that she was stupid enough to fall for him. Meggie tries to make Sephy believe that Callum was forced to write the letter by the rest of the gang, but the letter is so hurtful that Sephy believes it and develops [[postnatal depression]]. She meets Jaxon, a hot-tempered man with a band, the Midges. He offers Sephy a singing part, but the noughts are prejudiced against her because she is a cross. She begins to neglect Callie Rose.\n\nCara spends a lot of time with Jude. Although he loathes Crosses, he begins to fall in love with her. Frustrated and confused with his feelings for a cross, Jude beats her severely and runs off with a large amount of money. After she dies in hospital, Jude is eventually arrested and charged with Cara's murder. He is virtually certain to get the death sentence since his fingerprints are all over her apartment and had been seen with her by several witnesses.\n\nSephy struggles with seeing Meggie losing the last remaining member of her family. Sephy decides, for Meggie's sake, to give Jude a false [[alibi]] for Cara's death. That works, and after serving a few months in prison for LM membership, Jude accuses LM second-in-command Andrew Dorn of Cara's murder and claims Dorn is a government informer; Andrew is soon shot dead by the LM. Jude, even though Sephy saved his miserable life, still holds his grudge against her and plots a terrible revenge.\n\nSephy's life begins to fall apart. The crosses hate her because she helped Jude escape the noose, the noughts because she did not come to his aid sooner. She hugs her daughter too tightly while she sing the famous song \"Rainbow Child\". Callie Rose stops breathing, and Meggie screams at Sephy, \"What have you done?\"\n\n===''Checkmate''===\n{{Infobox book\n| name = Checkmate\n| image = \n| caption = Checkmate Front Cover\n| author = [[Malorie Blackman]]\n| illustrator = \n| cover_artist = \n| country = United Kingdom\n| language = English\n| series = Noughts & Crosses Saga\n| subject = \n| genre = [[Young adult fiction]]\n| publisher = [[Random House]]\n| pub_date = 30 June 2005\n| media_type = \n| pages = 511 p.\n| isbn = 978-0-385-60773-5\n| oclc = \n| preceded_by = [[Noughts & Crosses series#Knife Edge|Knife Edge]]\n| followed_by = [[Noughts & Crosses series#Double Cross|Double Cross]]\n}}\n\nCallie Rose struggles with growing up as half-nought and half-cross after she learns the truth about her nought father's life from her friend, Tobey, who calls her a terrorist's daughter. Callie Rose had been told by her mother that her father, Callum, had been a gardener who died in an accident. Callie Rose becomes angry with her mother, Sephy, for hiding the truth. She decides to follow the path of her father. She also cuts off her friendship with nought Tobey despite his attempts to apologise.\n\nSephy feels trapped and rejects an offer of marriage from her boyfriend, Sonny. She meets Nathan, the owner of the restaurant in which she sings, and the two start a relationship.\n\nJude takes Callie Rose to Kamal's house. After Kamal denies that she is his granddaughter, Jude, now the General of the LM, exploits her anger to groom her to become a suicide bomber.\n \nCallie Rose starts dating Lucas, a cross who is an ex-friend's brother. Jasmine, Sephy's mother, does what she can to bring Callie and Sephy closer together but develops [[breast cancer]] and struggles with her life. Nathan proposes to Sephy, who accepts, but Sonny shows up in her life again. Sephy is left confused but engaged.\n\nCeline Lubanjah, the daughter of Callum's prison guard Jack, gives a letter that was written by Callum before he was hanged. Callum told Jack this is the letter with his real feelings. Callum says in the letter he greatly wishes that he had been able to stay with Sephy, as he loved her so much. He also tells Sephy to keep his past secret from their child.\n\nSephy and Callie Rose resume their relationship after Jasmine traps them in her wine cellar so that they sort things out. Jasmine sets off the bomb to prevent Jude from injuring anyone else. Kamal had been the intended target of the bomb, but he only loses power, after Jasmine had sent a letter to the press about his rampant corruption.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===''Double Cross''===\n{{Infobox book\n| name = Double Cross\n| image = \n| caption = Double Cross Front Cover\n| author = [[Malorie Blackman]]\n| illustrator = \n| cover_artist = \n| country = United Kingdom\n| language = English\n| series = Noughts & Crosses Saga\n| subject = \n| genre = [[Young adult fiction]]\n| publisher = [[Random House]]\n| pub_date = November 2008\n| media_type = \n| pages = \n| isbn = 978-0-385-61551-8\n| oclc = \n| preceded_by = [[Noughts & Crosses series#Checkmate|Checkmate]]\n| followed_by = [[Noughts & Crosses series#Crossfire|Crossfire]]\n}}\n\nKamal's party loses the election badly to a more liberal government. Callie Rose knows secretly that she made the bomb that killed Jasmine and that it was intended for Jasmine's ex-husband, Kamal. Callie Rose also fears that Jude, her uncle, is still alive since he is known for serving revenge cold. The press fails to mention Jude in connection to the bomb but notes the death of Robert Powers.\n\nCallie Rose's best friend and later boyfriend, Tobey, is worried about his own future. As a Nought boy at an exclusive school, Tobey hopes to keep out of trouble, go to university, get a good job and leave behind the dangerous streets of his childhood. However, he cannot keep clinging to some kind of no-man's land while the neighbourhood around him is carved up by rival gangs, one headed by a ruthless man, Alex McAuley, the head of a gang of Noughts, and another headed by the Dowds, the head of a gang of Crosses. Both are powerful gangs that frequently injure and kill each other's members as well as suspected informants.\n\nTobey is offered the chance to earn some ready money just making a few 'deliveries' after he is introduced by a friend, Dan, who works for McAuley. Tobey wants no part of the world of gangs but makes an exception for once. \n\nTobey finds out that the delivery was the little finger of one of the Dowds, a manager at the restaurant. He keeps the secret from his girlfriend Callie Rose. They start kissing and touching each other. Callie Rose asks Tobey if he is ready. They make love. Callie Rose then leaves but promises to meet Tobey again.\n\nThe next day, when Dan, Tobey and Callie Rose get together, Callie Rose is shot by a hail of bullets from McAuley. Her surgery is successful, but she ends up in coma. Sephy is furious at Tobey for not becoming more of a man and telling the police who shot Callie Rose. Sephy does not know that Tobey has sworn revenge on McAuley and plans on doing so 'himself'.\n\nWhile Callie Rose is in hospital, Tobey gets a new job at TFTM (Thanks for the Memories), the Dowds' restaurant. He meets Rebecca, Vanessa Dowd's daughter. Rebecca loves his company, as he treats her like a person, unlike other boys, who are interested only in her family and money. Tobey eventually goes out with her but is confused between her and Callie Rose.\n\nCallie Rose wakes from her coma and finds out that Robert Powers was a false identity of Jude, who thus was certainly killed by the bomb. However, she learns that Tobey is dating Rebecca and that she had been in a coma for so long.\n\nDuring a visit to Vanessa Dowd's house, Tobey is revealed to have been making deliveries for McAuley. Rebecca is shocked, but Tobey reassures her that he does not work for him any longer. However, he decides to end their relationship and become merely 'friends'. When Rebecca leaves, McAuley appears and stabs her. He then orders Tobey to meet him at his warehouse.\n\nTobey knows that McAuley wants to kill him, but a plan is set up with Owen Dowd, Rebecca's brother. He puts a great deal of money in Byron Sweet, one of McAuley's minions, to frame him as a traitor. He goes to the warehouse and successfully executes his plan. However, he is almost killed by two more of McAuley's minions. Luckily, Dan appears from nowhere and kills the two minions outside and McAuley, saving Tobey's life. Dan ends up on the run.\n\nJasmine, in her will, gives both houses, including the beach, to Sephy. She also gives sums to Meggie (to whom she writes a letter of apology), Callie Rose, Minerva, Zuri, Taj and Sarah.\n\nTobey tells Callie that he is responsible for the deaths of five people (Rebecca Dowd, Bryon Sweet, Alex McAuley and minions Dave and Scott) and that Dan is on the run. Callie then points out that Jasmine and Jude died because of her. They eventually resume their relationship and admit their love.\n\nIn the epilogue, it is revealed that both Callie and Tobey go to university to study law and that Tobey has set up and helps fund the Meadowview Shelter to help those with drug and alcohol addictions.\n\n===''Crossfire''===\n\nThe fifth book in the series, ''Crossfire'', was published on 8 August 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/1000253/malorie-blackman.html|title=Malorie Blackman|website=penguin|access-date=12 May 2019}}</ref> Part of the book picks up months after ''Double Cross'' on Callie's birthday, exactly one year after ''Checkmate''; the rest occurs eighteen years later. Callie Rose and Tobey return as protagonists, while Callie's half-brother Troy Ealing and Tobey's daughter Libby Jackman are introduced. The plot focuses on Troy and Libby being kidnapped by masked assailants, with flashbacks illustrating their backstory, filling in the gaps between ''Double Cross'' and ''Crossfire'', and revealing the abductors' identities. The story ends on a cliffhanger, indicating an upcoming sixth instalment.\n\nTobey's guilt over Rebecca's death and his belief that he no longer deserves Callie Rose leads him to estrange himself from her, but they reunite months later. Sephy and Nathan marry, and she is pregnant with a son, Troy, by Callie Rose's next birthday. During the party Tobey and Callie Rose have a huge argument over his continued secrecy regarding the details of his involvement in McAuley's death, and he has an affair with classmate Misty Jackman, ending his and Callie Rose's relationship for good. Misty becomes pregnant and gives birth to Tobey's daughter Libby, and he attempts to have a relationship with her for their child's sake, but it soon collapses. In his resultant depression Tobey briefly joins Nought Forever, the Liberation Militia's spiritual successor, but soon quits. Callie Rose attends law school and later works for prominent lawyer Solomon Camden, becoming one of the best barristers in the country.\n\nTobey pursues a career in politics and is aided and bankrolled by Dan Jeavons, now a powerful gangster. He uses his growing fortune to financially support Misty and Libby, but Misty refuses to let him see their daughter, conceals his identity from Libby, and gradually spends Libby's entire trust fund. She becomes an alcohol and drug addict, and abuses Libby, who struggles with anxiety and begins self-harming. Troy and Libby become friends, but after a brief romance, their relationship sours and they become bitter rivals. Nathan is killed in a hit-and-run, leaving Sephy and Troy devastated. Over the next two years Sonny returns to Sephy's life and they resume their relationship, but Troy discovers what appears to be the same car that killed Nathan on Sonny's land, leaving him convinced that Sonny murdered his father.\n\nFinally learning her father's identity, Libby disowns Misty and contacts Tobey. With Dan's help Tobey is elected as the first Nought Prime Minister, but Dan is later murdered at a party attended by Tobey, Sephy and Owen Dowd, amongst others. Tobey is arrested for the crime and enlists Callie Rose to defend him, and they later have an ill-advised one-night stand, but she is repulsed to learn of his past affiliation with Nought Forever. When she threatens to drop him as a client, he blackmails her into continuing to defend him by threatening to reveal their affair to her employers. Unwilling to lose the money Tobey has been supplying her as a result of the rift between her and Libby, Misty helps several of Dan's former enforcers abduct Libby and Troy, holding them hostage. The other kidnappers murder a masked Misty when Libby deduces her identity, and they demand that Callie Rose drop Tobey as a client and that he plead guilty. In an effort to get Callie Rose to comply with the kidnappers' demands, Tobey tells her that Sephy murdered Dan, and that he covered for her by planting evidence to make himself appear guilty. Despite this revelation and the danger to Libby and Troy, Callie Rose continues to defend Tobey, who pleads his innocence as the trial begins. In response the kidnappers decide to leave Libby and Troy to die, sealing them in their cellar prison.\n\n== Novellas ==\n\n===''Callum''===\nThe novella changes the ending of ''Noughts and Crosses'' and was published for [[World Book Day]] 2012. \n\nCallum decides to let Sephy flee from the other kidnappers while they are out. While he shows her the way back to town, Sephy badly injures her foot. He talks her into spending the night with her in an abandoned shack for her to recover. There, they argue but then realise their mutual love. They decide to run away together. They fall asleep after making love.\n\nThe two are surprised by the rest of the gang. Jude and Callum point their guns at each other. Sephy takes advantage of the confusion to flee. Jude and Callum point their guns at each other, and the story ends as a [[cliffhanger]].\n\n===''An Eye For an Eye''===\nThe novella gives an insight into the events of ''Knife Edge''. Written for World Book Day 2003, it has been republished in a new edition of ''Noughts & Crosses''. ''An Eye For an Eye'' describes one evening while Sephy is pregnant with Callie Rose when her sister, Minerva, visits her. Minerva offers to patch up things with Jasmine, but Sephy tries to get Minerva to leave. As Sephy had feared after being followed by Jude for a few days, he arrives, planning to murder Sephy.\n\nJude, Callum's older brother, watches Sephy enter her apartment building, and he plans to kill her. However, he does not know that Minerva is also in Sephy's apartment.\n\nSephy tells Jude that she knew that he intended to kill her just before midnight since it was Callum's birthday that day. Jude feels that Sephy is responsible for Callum's death and wants to make sure that Sephy will not see Callum's next birthday since Callum had not seen his next birthday. Sephy is not alarmed and does not protest, but Minerva panics. Sephy tells Jude that he would be doing her a favour by killing her and wants to die because she misses Callum. When Minerva tries to change her mind, Sephy declares that she hates the baby because it was alive and that Callum should be alive instead. That is a lie, and Sephy later threatens to kill Jude if he ever hurts her child.\n\nSephy begins to provoke Jude by saying that she and Callum loved each other and Kamal offered her a choice of keeping the baby and letting Callum be hanged or getting an abortion and saving his life. Jude loses his temper and tries to shoot Sephy, but his gun jams. Minerva, in an attempt to save Sephy and herself, runs towards the front door and screams to attract attention. That fails, and Jude shoots her in the shoulder. Jude realises that Sephy wants to die. He decides that since killing her would only do her a favour, he will make her suffer instead.\n\nJude gives Sephy permission to call an ambulance for Minerva and tells her that he knows she cares about her sister and her family, especially her child. He then tells her that he plans to use her baby to hurt her. Sephy threatens to kill him if he hurts her child, but she later pleads with Jude to leave both of them alone. Jude leaves just as the ambulance arrives, with a new plan in mind. Sephy makes Minerva lie about her injuries.\n\n===''Nought Forever''===\nA World Book Day release in 2019, and a prequel to ''Crossfire''. Following on from the events of ''Double Cross'', a fugitive Dan is mortally wounded by McAuley's former enforcers, and is forced to hide out with a nurse, Eva, whose daughter Avalon committed suicide three years earlier after being drawn into drug addiction and prostitution by McAuley. Though she hides Dan from the criminals hunting him, Eva debates whether to continue sheltering him or turn him in to the police. The novella concludes without revealing the outcome of her decision, but ''Crossfire'' suggests that Eva continued to hide Dan but ultimately convinced him to turn himself in, and remained a friend and mother figure to him during his imprisonment and his later career as a gangster.\n\n==Characters==\nThe characters from all books from the series are as follows:\n\n===Primary characters===\n*Persephone Mira Hadley: the co-protagonist of ''Noughts & Crosses'' and ''Knife Edge'', and a supporting character in ''Checkmate'' and ''Double Cross''.

His biography on the official NBA website states: \"By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.\"<ref name=\"nbah\" /> He was one of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation and was considered instrumental in popularizing the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s.<ref>Markovits and Rensman, p. 89.</ref>\n\nJordan played three seasons for coach [[Dean Smith]] with the [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina Tar Heels]]. As a freshman, he was a member of the Tar Heels' national championship team in [[1982 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1982]]. Jordan joined the Bulls in [[1984\u201385 NBA season|1984]] as the third overall draft pick, and quickly emerged as a league star and entertained crowds with his prolific scoring. His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing [[slam dunk]]s from the [[free throw line]] in [[Slam Dunk Contest]]s, earned him the nicknames \"'''Air Jordan'''\" and \"'''His Airness'''\". He also gained a reputation for being one of the best defensive players in basketball.<ref name=\"defensive players\" /> In 1991, he won his first NBA championship with the Bulls, and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a \"[[three-peat]]\". Although Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the [[1993\u201394 NBA season]] and started a new career in [[Minor League Baseball]], he returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three additional championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular-season wins in the 1995\u201396 NBA season. He retired for a second time in January 1999 but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the [[Washington Wizards]].\n\nJordan's individual accolades and accomplishments include six [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards]], ten scoring titles (both all-time records), five [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP Awards]], ten [[All-NBA Team|All-NBA]] First Team designations, nine [[NBA All-Defensive Team|All-Defensive]] First Team honors, fourteen [[NBA All-Star Game]] selections, three [[NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|All-Star Game MVP Awards]], three [[steal (basketball)|steals]] titles, and the 1988 [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award]]. He holds the NBA records for highest career regular season scoring average (30.12 points per game) and highest career playoff scoring average (33.45 points per game). In 1999, he was named the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century by [[ESPN]], and was second to [[Babe Ruth]] on the [[Associated Press]]' list of athletes of the century. Jordan is a two-time inductee into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]], having been enshrined in 2009 for his individual career and again in 2010 as part of the group induction of the [[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team]] (\"The Dream Team\"). He became a member of the [[FIBA Hall of Fame]] in 2015.\n\nJordan is also known for his product endorsements. He fueled the success of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]'s [[Air Jordan]] sneakers which were introduced in 1984 and remain popular today.<ref name=\"remain popular\" /> Jordan also starred as himself in the 1996 film ''[[Space Jam]]''. In 2006, he became part-owner and head of basketball operations for the Charlotte Bobcats (now Hornets) and bought a controlling interest in 2010. In 2014, Jordan became the first billionaire player in NBA history. With a net worth of $2.1&nbsp;billion, he is the fourth-richest African-American, behind [[Robert F. Smith (investor)|Robert F.

He played 15 seasons in the NBA, winning six championships with the [[Chicago Bulls]]. His biography on the official NBA website states: \"By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.\"<ref name=\"nbah\" /> He was one of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation and was considered instrumental in popularizing the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s.<ref>Markovits and Rensman, p. 89.</ref>\n\nJordan played three seasons for coach [[Dean Smith]] with the [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina Tar Heels]]. As a freshman, he was a member of the Tar Heels' national championship team in [[1982 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1982]]. Jordan joined the Bulls in [[1984\u201385 NBA season|1984]] as the third overall draft pick, and quickly emerged as a league star and entertained crowds with his prolific scoring. His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing [[slam dunk]]s from the [[free throw line]] in [[Slam Dunk Contest]]s, earned him the nicknames \"'''Air Jordan'''\" and \"'''His Airness'''\". He also gained a reputation for being one of the best defensive players in basketball.<ref name=\"defensive players\" /> In 1991, he won his first NBA championship with the Bulls, and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a \"[[three-peat]]\". Although Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the [[1993\u201394 NBA season]] and started a new career in [[Minor League Baseball]], he returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three additional championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular-season wins in the 1995\u201396 NBA season. He retired for a second time in January 1999 but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the [[Washington Wizards]].\n\nJordan's individual accolades and accomplishments include six [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards]], ten scoring titles (both all-time records), five [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP Awards]], ten [[All-NBA Team|All-NBA]] First Team designations, nine [[NBA All-Defensive Team|All-Defensive]] First Team honors, fourteen [[NBA All-Star Game]] selections, three [[NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|All-Star Game MVP Awards]], three [[steal (basketball)|steals]] titles, and the 1988 [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award]]. He holds the NBA records for highest career regular season scoring average (30.12 points per game) and highest career playoff scoring average (33.45 points per game). In 1999, he was named the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century by [[ESPN]], and was second to [[Babe Ruth]] on the [[Associated Press]]' list of athletes of the century. Jordan is a two-time inductee into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]], having been enshrined in 2009 for his individual career and again in 2010 as part of the group induction of the [[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team]] (\"The Dream Team\"). He became a member of the [[FIBA Hall of Fame]] in 2015.\n\nJordan is also known for his product endorsements. He fueled the success of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]'s [[Air Jordan]] sneakers which were introduced in 1984 and remain popular today.<ref name=\"remain popular\" /> Jordan also starred as himself in the 1996 film ''[[Space Jam]]''. In 2006, he became part-owner and head of basketball operations for the Charlotte Bobcats (now Hornets) and bought a controlling interest in 2010. In 2014, Jordan became the first billionaire player in NBA history. With a net worth of $2.1&nbsp;billion, he is the fourth-richest African-American, behind [[Robert F. Smith (investor)|Robert F.
