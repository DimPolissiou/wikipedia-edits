These assets are continually turned over in the course of a business during normal business activity. There are 5 major items included into current assets:\n# '''[[Cash and cash equivalents]]''' \u2013 it is the most [[Market liquidity|liquid asset]], which includes [[currency]], [[deposit account]]s, and [[negotiable instrument]]s (e.g., money orders, cheque, bank drafts).\n# '''[[Investment|Short-term investments]]''' \u2013 include securities bought and held for sale in the near future to generate income on short-term price differences (trading securities).\n# '''[[Receivable]]s''' \u2013 usually reported as net of allowance for non-collectable accounts.\n# '''[[Inventory]]''' \u2013 trading these assets is a normal business of a company. The inventory value reported on the [[balance sheet]] is usually the historical cost or fair market value, whichever is lower. This is known as the \"[[lower of cost or market]]\" rule.\n# '''[[Prepaid expense]]s''' \u2013 these are expenses paid in cash and recorded as assets before they are used or consumed (common examples are insurance or office supplies). See also [[adjusting entries]].\n[[Marketable securities]]: Securities that can be converted into cash quickly at a reasonable price.\n\nThe phrase ''net current assets'' (also called ''[[working capital]]'') is often used and refers to the total of current assets less the total of current [[liability (accounting)|liabilities]].\n\n===Long-term investments===\nOften referred to simply as \"investments\". Long-term investments are to be held for many years and are not intended to be disposed of in the near future. This group usually consists of three types of investments:\n# Investments in securities such as bonds, common stock, or long-term notes.\n# Investments in fixed assets not used in operations (e.g., land held for sale).\n# Investments in special funds (e.g. sinking funds or pension funds).\n\nDifferent forms of [[insurance]] may also be treated as long term investments.\n\n===Fixed assets===\n{{Main article|Fixed asset}}\n\nAlso referred to as PPE (property, plant, and equipment), these are purchased for continued and long-term use in earning [[profit (economics)|profit]] in a business. This group includes as an asset [[Land (economics)|land]], [[building]]s, [[machinery]], [[furniture]], [[tool]]s, [[Information technology|IT]] equipment, e.g., laptops, and certain wasting resources e.g., timberland and [[mineral]]s. They are written off against [[profit (accounting)|profit]]s over their anticipated life by charging [[depreciation]] expenses (with exception of land assets). Accumulated depreciation is shown in the face of the balance sheet or in the notes. An asset is an important factor in a balance sheet.\n\nThese are also called [[capital asset]]s in [[management accounting]].\n\n===Intangible assets===\n{{Main article|Intangible asset}}\n\nIntangible assets lack of physical substance and usually are very hard to evaluate. They include [[patent]]s, [[copyright]]s, [[franchising|franchises]], [[Goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]], [[trademark]]s, [[trade name]]s, etc. These assets are (according to US GAAP) amortized to expense over 5 to 40 years with the exception of goodwill.\n\n[[Website]]s are treated differently in different countries and may fall under either tangible or intangible assets.\n\n===Tangible assets===\nTangible assets are those that have a physical substance, such as [[currency|currencies]], [[buildings]], [[real estate]], [[vehicles]], [[Inventory|inventories]], [[capital equipment|equipment]], [[Private collection|art collections]], [[precious metals]], [[rare-earth metals]], Industrial metals, and crops. The physical health of tangible assets deteriorate over time. As a result, asset managers use [[deterioration modeling]] to predict the future conditions of assets.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/97601|title=Piryonesi, S.

The inventory value reported on the [[balance sheet]] is usually the historical cost or fair market value, whichever is lower. This is known as the \"[[lower of cost or market]]\" rule.\n# '''[[Prepaid expense]]s''' \u2013 these are expenses paid in cash and recorded as assets before they are used or consumed (common examples are insurance or office supplies). See also [[adjusting entries]].\n[[Marketable securities]]: Securities that can be converted into cash quickly at a reasonable price.\n\nThe phrase ''net current assets'' (also called ''[[working capital]]'') is often used and refers to the total of current assets less the total of current [[liability (accounting)|liabilities]].\n\n===Long-term investments===\nOften referred to simply as \"investments\". Long-term investments are to be held for many years and are not intended to be disposed of in the near future. This group usually consists of three types of investments:\n# Investments in securities such as bonds, common stock, or long-term notes.\n# Investments in fixed assets not used in operations (e.g., land held for sale).\n# Investments in special funds (e.g. sinking funds or pension funds).\n\nDifferent forms of [[insurance]] may also be treated as long term investments.\n\n===Fixed assets===\n{{Main article|Fixed asset}}\n\nAlso referred to as PPE (property, plant, and equipment), these are purchased for continued and long-term use in earning [[profit (economics)|profit]] in a business. This group includes as an asset [[Land (economics)|land]], [[building]]s, [[machinery]], [[furniture]], [[tool]]s, [[Information technology|IT]] equipment, e.g., laptops, and certain wasting resources e.g., timberland and [[mineral]]s. They are written off against [[profit (accounting)|profit]]s over their anticipated life by charging [[depreciation]] expenses (with exception of land assets). Accumulated depreciation is shown in the face of the balance sheet or in the notes. An asset is an important factor in a balance sheet.\n\nThese are also called [[capital asset]]s in [[management accounting]].\n\n===Intangible assets===\n{{Main article|Intangible asset}}\n\nIntangible assets lack of physical substance and usually are very hard to evaluate. They include [[patent]]s, [[copyright]]s, [[franchising|franchises]], [[Goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]], [[trademark]]s, [[trade name]]s, etc. These assets are (according to US GAAP) amortized to expense over 5 to 40 years with the exception of goodwill.\n\n[[Website]]s are treated differently in different countries and may fall under either tangible or intangible assets.\n\n===Tangible assets===\nTangible assets are those that have a physical substance, such as [[currency|currencies]], [[buildings]], [[real estate]], [[vehicles]], [[Inventory|inventories]], [[capital equipment|equipment]], [[Private collection|art collections]], [[precious metals]], [[rare-earth metals]], Industrial metals, and crops. The physical health of tangible assets deteriorate over time. As a result, asset managers use [[deterioration modeling]] to predict the future conditions of assets.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/97601|title=Piryonesi, S.

Thus it would be possible to reference a component of an encoded value present in a document by combining an OID (assigned to the document) and an \"absolute reference\" to the component of the value. However, there is no standard way to indicate that a field contains such an absolute reference. Therefore, a generic ASN.1 tool/library cannot automatically encode/decode/resolve references within a document without help from custom-written program code.\n*g. {{note|vpack1refs}}VelocyPack offers a value type to store pointers to other VPack items.

Thus it would be possible to reference a component of an encoded value present in a document by combining an OID (assigned to the document) and an \"absolute reference\" to the component of the value. However, there is no standard way to indicate that a field contains such an absolute reference. Therefore, a generic ASN.1 tool/library cannot automatically encode/decode/resolve references within a document without help from custom-written program code.\n*g. {{note|vpack1refs}}VelocyPack offers a value type to store pointers to other VPack items.
