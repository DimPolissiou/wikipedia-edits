Its lyrics describe two lovers taking a trip to a relaxing place on Kokomo, an invented idea of an island off the [[Florida Keys]]. It was released as a single on July 18, 1988 by [[Elektra Records]] and became a No. 1 Hit in the United States, Japan, and Australia (where it topped for about two months). The single was released to coincide with the release of [[Roger Donaldson]]'s film ''[[Cocktail (1988 film)|Cocktail]]'' and its subsequent soundtrack.\n\nIt was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or Television]] in 1988, but lost to [[Phil Collins]]' \"[[Two Hearts (Phil Collins song)|Two Hearts]]\" (from the film ''[[Buster (film)|Buster]]'').<ref>{{cite web |title=Grammy Award |url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/1989-grammy-awards.html#ixzz0bxi469dF |website= metrolyrics.com |accessdate=January 7, 2010}}</ref> \"Two Hearts\" and [[Carly Simon]]'s \"[[Let the River Run]]\" from ''[[Working Girl]]'' jointly beat it for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song]].\n\n==Composition and recording==\nThe song was written by John Phillips and Scott McKenzie in Virginia Beach in 1988 and recorded and produced shortly after by Phillips, as a duet between McKenzie and [[Denny Doherty]] of the [[The Mamas & the Papas|Mamas and the Papas]]. That version remained unreleased until 2010, when it appeared on a posthumous album of John Phillips' songs called ''Many Mamas, Many Papas'', most of which were originally recorded in the 1980s for a reconstituted touring version of the Mamas and the Papas, featuring himself, Doherty, daughter [[Mackenzie Phillips]] and [[Spanky McFarlane]] of [[Spanky and Our Gang]].\n\nWhen the Beach Boys were commissioned to produce a theme song for ''[[Cocktail (1988 film)|Cocktail]]'', producer [[Terry Melcher]] contacted his old friend, Phillips, and asked if he had any songs that might be suitable. \"Kokomo\" was one of the songs Phillips sent Melcher. Another was \"Somewhere Near Japan\" (aka \"Fairytale Girl\"), which would also be recorded by the Beach Boys for their ''[[Still Cruisin']]'' album.\n\nAlthough Phillips had holidayed in the Caribbean several times on the island of [[Mustique]], which was owned by his friend [[Colin Tennant, 3rd Baron Glenconner|Colin Tennant]], \"Kokomo\" itself is fictional. Although there are several places named Kokomo\u2014including [[Kokomo, Indiana]]; [[Kokomo, Arkansas]]; and [[Kokomo, Hawaii]]\u2014the song describes a fictional Kokomo as a place \"off the [[Florida Keys]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=505|title=Kokomo By The Beach Boys Songfacts|accessdate=February 18, 2010}}</ref> The name was later used by resorts in [[Sandals Cay]], Jamaica, [[Fiji]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kokomoislandfiji.com/ |title=Kokomo Private Island Fiji \u2013 Exclusive Luxury Resorts & Villas |publisher=Kokomoislandfiji.com |date= |accessdate=July 1, 2019}}</ref> and [[Grassy Key]], Florida. The song also mentions many island locales: in order of their appearance in the song, [[Aruba]], [[Jamaica]], [[Bermuda]], [[Bahamas|Bahama(s)]], [[Key Largo]], [[Montego Bay|Montego (Bay)]], [[Martinique]], [[Montserrat]], and [[Port-au-Prince]] (with the first six places mentioned in the chorus).\n\nIn addition to the Beach Boys' signature layered-singing style, the song's instrumentation makes heavy use of [[steel drum]]s. According to \"Kokomo\" track sheet information supplied by engineer Keith Wechsler, the steel drums were played by musicians named Vince, Milton, and Mike (but not Mike Love). Wechsler also says that there is a percussionist by the name of Chili who played percussion in the introduction of the song. [[Van Dyke Parks]], a multi-instrumentalist who served as lyricist for the band's aborted album [[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|''SMiLE'']], played accordion, while session veteran [[Jim Keltner]] played drums.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,640541,00.html |title=Kokomo |first=Scott |last=Brown |first2=Michael | last2=Endleman |date=May 28, 2004 |publisher=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=December 1, 2009}}</ref> Other players are [[Jeff Foskett]] (acoustic guitar), Rod Clark (bass), Joel Peskin (alto saxophone) and [[Ry Cooder]] (electric [[slide guitar]]).\n\nOn the Beach Boys demo of \"Kokomo\", lead vocals were performed by Mike Love and Terry Melcher. The demo harmonies include Terry Melcher, Bruce Johnston, Mike Love, and Jeff Foskett. At Disney Films' request, the \"Kokomo\" demo was \"upgraded\" to a master recording, thus requiring members of the Beach Boys to re-record the demo vocals, except for Mike Love's lead.\n\nThe final recorded and released \"Kokomo\" background vocals are sung by Carl Wilson, Mike Love, Bruce Johnston, and Al Jardine. Terry Melcher's and Jeff Foskett's background vocals (on the demo) were erased and replaced by Carl Wilson's and Al Jardine's background vocals. The final released \"Kokomo\" lead vocals are sung by Mike Love and Carl Wilson.  The only active Beach Boys member not involved with the recording was [[Brian Wilson]], who was given short notice of the recording session and not permitted by his doctor to attend.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} He would later appear as a backing vocalist on a Spanish version of the song and also appears on live recordings of the song, including a live concert filmed for the television show ''[[Full House]]'' (episode 028) and the 2013 live album ''[[Live \u2013 The 50th Anniversary Tour]]''.\n\nMike Love and Terry Melcher's major contribution to the song was a re-write of Phillips and McKenzie's existing chorus and the addition of the \"Aruba, Jamaica\u2026\" lines. The Beach Boys version of the song also retained the melody of the Phillips and Mackenzie original. All four shared co-writing credits on the song.\n\nThere were previous songs referencing a Kokomo, including \"Kokomo Blues\" (1928) by [[Kokomo Arnold]], \"Kokomo (I Love You So)\" (1955) recorded by Gene & Eunice, \"Kokomo (I Love You So)\" (1955) recorded by Perry Como, and \"Kokomo me Baby\" (1959) by [[Mississippi Fred McDowell]], but these are believed to be in reference to [[Kokomo, Indiana]]. The 1979 song \"Kokomo\", written by [[Lowell George]] and recorded by [[Little Feat]], does not reference Kokomo as a place.\n\n==Release==\nThe \"Kokomo\" single backed with \"[[Tutti Frutti (song)|Tutti Frutti]]\" by [[Little Richard]] was first released through Elektra Records in July 1988. It peaked at the #1 position on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] on November 5, 1988, replacing \"[[A Groovy Kind of Love]]\" by [[Phil Collins]]. Thus it became The Beach Boys' first #1 hit in the [[United States]] since \"[[Good Vibrations]]\" in 1966, marking the longest time span between two number-one hits in America for any band (22 years). It is also their only #1 hit not written or produced by Brian Wilson. Coincidentally, the original version of \"A Groovy Kind of Love\" by [[The Mindbenders]] replaced the Beach Boys' song \"[[Sloop John B]]\" at the #5 position in May 1966. The single spent only one week at the top of the Hot 100, and was replaced by [[The Escape Club]] song \"[[Wild, Wild West (The Escape Club song)|Wild, Wild West]]\". After being signed to [[Capitol Records]] following the success of the initial single, Capitol issued the song in the United States for a second time. The song was re-released in July 1989 as the B-side of the \"Still Cruisin'\" single, which peaked at number 93 on the Hot 100. Capitol re-issued the song a third time, just two months later, as the B-side of the \"Somewhere Near Japan\" single, but the single failed to chart.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the single was first issued by Elektra in October 1988. The single peaked at number 25 on the charts. After Capitol had signed the band, as they had in the U.S., they released the single for the second time as the B-side of the \"Still Cruisin'\" single. However it failed to make any impact on the charts. In Australia the single became the band's third number one hit in Australia after \"[[Do It Again (The Beach Boys song)|Do It Again]]\" in 1968 and \"[[Cotton Fields]]\" in 1970. In New Zealand the single peaked at the number 5 position. In the Dutch singles chart, the single peaked at the number 6 position. The song also peaked at number 19 in Belgium and at number 7 in Germany.\n\n==Album and alternative releases==\n\"Kokomo\" was first released on an album in 1989 on the band's ''[[Still Cruisin']]'' album. The band had been given a one-off album contract by their former label Capitol Records after the song became a number 1 hit in both the United States and Australia. Brian Wilson, who did not perform on the original recording of the song, did later contribute vocals to a Spanish-language version.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n==Music video==\nThe video for \"Kokomo\" was filmed at the then-recently opened [[Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa|Grand Floridian Resort]] at [[Walt Disney World Resort|Walt Disney World]] in Florida. The resort had not opened when the video was shot and the band were their first guests. The staff of the hotel practiced their menu on the band by trying out recipes and drinks. The crowd on the fake beach contained college cheerleaders from [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]]. It took less than two hours to shoot the video because it threatened to rain. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The members of the Beach Boys in the video are: [[Carl Wilson]] (playing guitar), [[Al Jardine]] (playing tambourine), [[Bruce Johnston]] (playing bass guitar), and [[Mike Love]] (saxophone). Actor and occasional Beach Boys live guest [[John Stamos]] can be seen playing the [[conga]], bongos and steel drum. Brian Wilson was not featured and \"Kokomo\" represents the only promotional video the Beach Boys produced in the 1980s without him.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In addition, this video features random clips from the movie ''[[Cocktail (1988 film)|Cocktail]]''.\n\n==Recognition and criticisms==\n\"Kokomo\" has received mixed reviews. In 1989, the song received a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nomination for Best Original Song \u2013 Motion Picture in 1989. Conversely, it has been included in lists of poorly received songs, such as VH1's \"40 Most Awesomely Bad No. 1 Songs\" and ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' magazine's list of the \"50 Worst Songs Ever\".<ref>[http://www.blender.com/lists/61412/the50worstsongseverwatchlistenandcringe.html?p=8 The 50 Worst Songs Ever!

The lyrics \"under a tropical island sky\" replaced the lyrics \"gave me a tropical [[contact high]]\", to replace the [[marijuana]] reference in keeping with the family-friendly nature of the Muppets. The music video version of the song features a tenor saxophone solo played by Dan Higgins, simultaneous with the guitar solo. It was shown on [[Nickelodeon]], and was distributed by [[Jim Henson Records]] and [[BMG Kidz]].\n*In 2003, singers [[Adam Green (musician)|Adam Green]] and [[Ben Kweller]] covered the song as a [[B-side]] for Green's song \"Jessica\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/kokomo-mt0000679406|title=AllMusic.com Adam Green Kokomo|accessdate=April 15, 2013}}</ref>\n*In 2016, the French band [[Lilly Wood and the Prick]] covered the song with some French lyrics mixed in with the original lyrics.\n\n===In popular culture===\n*The Beach Boys guest star in Season 2 Episode 6 of ''[[Full House]]''. They perform \"Kokomo\" in their house and in the live concert, in which the ''Full House'' cast helped sing \"Barbara Ann\".\n*In a ''[[Two Guys and a Girl]]'' episode, \"Two Guys and a Girl and a Vacation\", the three main characters sing the song throughout the episode in celebration of their upcoming holiday.\n*In the third episode of the eighth season of ''[[Friends]]'', Chandler briefly sings a few lines from the song.\n*On an episode of ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', [[Chris Turk|Turk]] suggests Elliot and Keith honeymoon in Kokomo, but [[Elliot Reid|Elliot]] shoots down his fantasy, telling him blankly \"For the last time, there is no such place as 'Kokomo'!\" to which Turk angrily responds, \"Then *where* did The Beach Boys shoot the video, huh?!\"\n*In an episode of ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', \"[[Three Days of Snow]]\", Ted and Barney are keeping a bar open after last call to wait for their dates and are lip-syncing to the song.\n*The [[The Simpsons (season 15)|Season 15]] episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', \"[[Today I Am a Clown]]\", features a parody of both the band and the song, with Jewish themes, during the [[Krusty the Klown]]'s [[bar mitzvah]].\n*In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode \"The Tan Aquatic with Steve Zissou\", Stewie sings the chorus of the song while inside a tanning bed.\n*In ''[[American Dad!]]'' Season 3 Episode 14 \"Office Spaceman\" Roger the alien as \"Parker Peters\" lists the islands named in the chorus of the song as destinations to go hunting for the mysterious alien (Roger himself).\n*In the episode \"Pour Judgment\" of ''[[The King of Queens]]'', the song is played during a scene where Doug attends bartender school.\n*The song is played in the episode \"The Burgers of Wrath\" of ''[[Spin City]]'', in a scene where Charlie and Carter are helping out in a fast food-restaurant.\n*In ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'' season 12 episode 11, Alan and Walden's support group sings a phrase of the song.\n*In the ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]'' episode \"Boyle-Linetti Wedding\", Charles and Lynn Boyle consider \"Kokomo\" the \"best rock-and-roll song ever written\", tied with \"[[Don't You (Forget About Me)]]\".\n* The song is heard in the episode \"Look Out for Number One\" of ''[[Orange is the New Black]]'', during a scene in which Frieda gets moved to one of the calmer cell blocks at Litchfield Penitentiary.\n* The place is mentioned in the ''[[Lana del Rey]]'' song \"[[The Greatest (Lana Del Rey song)|The Greatest]]\" in the lyric: \"I miss the bar where the Beach Boys would go / Dennis' last stop before Kokomo\" referring to Kokomo as a place the singer would go after the end of his life.\n\n==Track listings==\n; 3\" CD single\n# \"Kokomo\" \u2013 3:34\n# \"Tutti Frutti\"

McKenzie]], [[Mike Love]], and [[Terry Melcher]] and recorded by American rock band [[the Beach Boys]]. Its lyrics describe two lovers taking a trip to a relaxing place on Kokomo, an invented idea of an island off the [[Florida Keys]]. It was released as a single on July 18, 1988 by [[Elektra Records]] and became a No. 1 Hit in the United States, Japan, and Australia (where it topped for about two months). The single was released to coincide with the release of [[Roger Donaldson]]'s film ''[[Cocktail (1988 film)|Cocktail]]'' and its subsequent soundtrack.\n\nIt was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or Television]] in 1988, but lost to [[Phil Collins]]' \"[[Two Hearts (Phil Collins song)|Two Hearts]]\" (from the film ''[[Buster (film)|Buster]]'').<ref>{{cite web |title=Grammy Award |url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/1989-grammy-awards.html#ixzz0bxi469dF |website= metrolyrics.com |accessdate=January 7, 2010}}</ref> \"Two Hearts\" and [[Carly Simon]]'s \"[[Let the River Run]]\" from ''[[Working Girl]]'' jointly beat it for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song]].\n\n==Composition and recording==\nThe song was written by John Phillips and Scott McKenzie in Virginia Beach in 1988 and recorded and produced shortly after by Phillips, as a duet between McKenzie and [[Denny Doherty]] of the [[The Mamas & the Papas|Mamas and the Papas]]. That version remained unreleased until 2010, when it appeared on a posthumous album of John Phillips' songs called ''Many Mamas, Many Papas'', most of which were originally recorded in the 1980s for a reconstituted touring version of the Mamas and the Papas, featuring himself, Doherty, daughter [[Mackenzie Phillips]] and [[Spanky McFarlane]] of [[Spanky and Our Gang]].\n\nWhen the Beach Boys were commissioned to produce a theme song for ''[[Cocktail (1988 film)|Cocktail]]'', producer [[Terry Melcher]] contacted his old friend, Phillips, and asked if he had any songs that might be suitable. \"Kokomo\" was one of the songs Phillips sent Melcher. Another was \"Somewhere Near Japan\" (aka \"Fairytale Girl\"), which would also be recorded by the Beach Boys for their ''[[Still Cruisin']]'' album.\n\nAlthough Phillips had holidayed in the Caribbean several times on the island of [[Mustique]], which was owned by his friend [[Colin Tennant, 3rd Baron Glenconner|Colin Tennant]], \"Kokomo\" itself is fictional. Although there are several places named Kokomo\u2014including [[Kokomo, Indiana]]; [[Kokomo, Arkansas]]; and [[Kokomo, Hawaii]]\u2014the song describes a fictional Kokomo as a place \"off the [[Florida Keys]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=505|title=Kokomo By The Beach Boys Songfacts|accessdate=February 18, 2010}}</ref> The name was later used by resorts in [[Sandals Cay]], Jamaica, [[Fiji]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kokomoislandfiji.com/ |title=Kokomo Private Island Fiji \u2013 Exclusive Luxury Resorts & Villas |publisher=Kokomoislandfiji.com |date= |accessdate=July 1, 2019}}</ref> and [[Grassy Key]], Florida. The song also mentions many island locales: in order of their appearance in the song, [[Aruba]], [[Jamaica]], [[Bermuda]], [[Bahamas|Bahama(s)]], [[Key Largo]], [[Montego Bay|Montego (Bay)]], [[Martinique]], [[Montserrat]], and [[Port-au-Prince]] (with the first six places mentioned in the chorus).\n\nIn addition to the Beach Boys' signature layered-singing style, the song's instrumentation makes heavy use of [[steel drum]]s. According to \"Kokomo\" track sheet information supplied by engineer Keith Wechsler, the steel drums were played by musicians named Vince, Milton, and Mike (but not Mike Love). Wechsler also says that there is a percussionist by the name of Chili who played percussion in the introduction of the song. [[Van Dyke Parks]], a multi-instrumentalist who served as lyricist for the band's aborted album [[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|''SMiLE'']], played accordion, while session veteran [[Jim Keltner]] played drums.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,640541,00.html |title=Kokomo |first=Scott |last=Brown |first2=Michael | last2=Endleman |date=May 28, 2004 |publisher=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=December 1, 2009}}</ref> Other players are [[Jeff Foskett]] (acoustic guitar), Rod Clark (bass), Joel Peskin (alto saxophone) and [[Ry Cooder]] (electric [[slide guitar]]).\n\nOn the Beach Boys demo of \"Kokomo\", lead vocals were performed by Mike Love and Terry Melcher. The demo harmonies include Terry Melcher, Bruce Johnston, Mike Love, and Jeff Foskett. At Disney Films' request, the \"Kokomo\" demo was \"upgraded\" to a master recording, thus requiring members of the Beach Boys to re-record the demo vocals, except for Mike Love's lead.\n\nThe final recorded and released \"Kokomo\" background vocals are sung by Carl Wilson, Mike Love, Bruce Johnston, and Al Jardine. Terry Melcher's and Jeff Foskett's background vocals (on the demo) were erased and replaced by Carl Wilson's and Al Jardine's background vocals. The final released \"Kokomo\" lead vocals are sung by Mike Love and Carl Wilson.  The only active Beach Boys member not involved with the recording was [[Brian Wilson]], who was given short notice of the recording session and not permitted by his doctor to attend.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} He would later appear as a backing vocalist on a Spanish version of the song and also appears on live recordings of the song, including a live concert filmed for the television show ''[[Full House]]'' (episode 028) and the 2013 live album ''[[Live \u2013 The 50th Anniversary Tour]]''.\n\nMike Love and Terry Melcher's major contribution to the song was a re-write of Phillips and McKenzie's existing chorus and the addition of the \"Aruba, Jamaica\u2026\" lines. The Beach Boys version of the song also retained the melody of the Phillips and Mackenzie original. All four shared co-writing credits on the song.\n\nThere were previous songs referencing a Kokomo, including \"Kokomo Blues\" (1928) by [[Kokomo Arnold]], \"Kokomo (I Love You So)\" (1955) recorded by Gene & Eunice, \"Kokomo (I Love You So)\" (1955) recorded by Perry Como, and \"Kokomo me Baby\" (1959) by [[Mississippi Fred McDowell]], but these are believed to be in reference to [[Kokomo, Indiana]]. The 1979 song \"Kokomo\", written by [[Lowell George]] and recorded by [[Little Feat]], does not reference Kokomo as a place.\n\n==Release==\nThe \"Kokomo\" single backed with \"[[Tutti Frutti (song)|Tutti Frutti]]\" by [[Little Richard]] was first released through Elektra Records in July 1988. It peaked at the #1 position on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] on November 5, 1988, replacing \"[[A Groovy Kind of Love]]\" by [[Phil Collins]]. Thus it became The Beach Boys' first #1 hit in the [[United States]] since \"[[Good Vibrations]]\" in 1966, marking the longest time span between two number-one hits in America for any band (22 years). It is also their only #1 hit not written or produced by Brian Wilson. Coincidentally, the original version of \"A Groovy Kind of Love\" by [[The Mindbenders]] replaced the Beach Boys' song \"[[Sloop John B]]\" at the #5 position in May 1966. The single spent only one week at the top of the Hot 100, and was replaced by [[The Escape Club]] song \"[[Wild, Wild West (The Escape Club song)|Wild, Wild West]]\". After being signed to [[Capitol Records]] following the success of the initial single, Capitol issued the song in the United States for a second time. The song was re-released in July 1989 as the B-side of the \"Still Cruisin'\" single, which peaked at number 93 on the Hot 100. Capitol re-issued the song a third time, just two months later, as the B-side of the \"Somewhere Near Japan\" single, but the single failed to chart.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the single was first issued by Elektra in October 1988. The single peaked at number 25 on the charts. After Capitol had signed the band, as they had in the U.S., they released the single for the second time as the B-side of the \"Still Cruisin'\" single. However it failed to make any impact on the charts. In Australia the single became the band's third number one hit in Australia after \"[[Do It Again (The Beach Boys song)|Do It Again]]\" in 1968 and \"[[Cotton Fields]]\" in 1970. In New Zealand the single peaked at the number 5 position. In the Dutch singles chart, the single peaked at the number 6 position. The song also peaked at number 19 in Belgium and at number 7 in Germany.\n\n==Album and alternative releases==\n\"Kokomo\" was first released on an album in 1989 on the band's ''[[Still Cruisin']]'' album. The band had been given a one-off album contract by their former label Capitol Records after the song became a number 1 hit in both the United States and Australia. Brian Wilson, who did not perform on the original recording of the song, did later contribute vocals to a Spanish-language version.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n==Music video==\nThe video for \"Kokomo\" was filmed at the then-recently opened [[Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa|Grand Floridian Resort]] at [[Walt Disney World Resort|Walt Disney World]] in Florida. The resort had not opened when the video was shot and the band were their first guests. The staff of the hotel practiced their menu on the band by trying out recipes and drinks. The crowd on the fake beach contained college cheerleaders from [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]]. It took less than two hours to shoot the video because it threatened to rain. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The members of the Beach Boys in the video are: [[Carl Wilson]] (playing guitar), [[Al Jardine]] (playing tambourine), [[Bruce Johnston]] (playing bass guitar), and [[Mike Love]] (saxophone). Actor and occasional Beach Boys live guest [[John Stamos]] can be seen playing the [[conga]], bongos and steel drum. Brian Wilson was not featured and \"Kokomo\" represents the only promotional video the Beach Boys produced in the 1980s without him.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In addition, this video features random clips from the movie ''[[Cocktail (1988 film)|Cocktail]]''.\n\n==Recognition and criticisms==\n\"Kokomo\" has received mixed reviews. In 1989, the song received a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nomination for Best Original Song \u2013 Motion Picture in 1989. Conversely, it has been included in lists of poorly received songs, such as VH1's \"40 Most Awesomely Bad No. 1 Songs\" and ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' magazine's list of the \"50 Worst Songs Ever\".<ref>[http://www.blender.com/lists/61412/the50worstsongseverwatchlistenandcringe.html?p=8 The 50 Worst Songs Ever!

The lyrics \"under a tropical island sky\" replaced the lyrics \"gave me a tropical [[contact high]]\", to replace the [[marijuana]] reference in keeping with the family-friendly nature of the Muppets. The music video version of the song features a tenor saxophone solo played by Dan Higgins, simultaneous with the guitar solo. It was shown on [[Nickelodeon]], and was distributed by [[Jim Henson Records]] and [[BMG Kidz]].\n*In 2003, singers [[Adam Green (musician)|Adam Green]] and [[Ben Kweller]] covered the song as a [[B-side]] for Green's song \"Jessica\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/kokomo-mt0000679406|title=AllMusic.com Adam Green Kokomo|accessdate=April 15, 2013}}</ref>\n*In 2016, the French band [[Lilly Wood and the Prick]] covered the song with some French lyrics mixed in with the original lyrics.\n\n===In popular culture===\n*The Beach Boys guest star in Season 2 Episode 6 of ''[[Full House]]''. They perform \"Kokomo\" in their house and in the live concert, in which the ''Full House'' cast helped sing \"Barbara Ann\".\n*In a ''[[Two Guys and a Girl]]'' episode, \"Two Guys and a Girl and a Vacation\", the three main characters sing the song throughout the episode in celebration of their upcoming holiday.\n*In the third episode of the eighth season of ''[[Friends]]'', Chandler briefly sings a few lines from the song.\n*On an episode of ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', [[Chris Turk|Turk]] suggests Elliot and Keith honeymoon in Kokomo, but [[Elliot Reid|Elliot]] shoots down his fantasy, telling him blankly \"For the last time, there is no such place as 'Kokomo'!\" to which Turk angrily responds, \"Then *where* did The Beach Boys shoot the video, huh?!\"\n*In an episode of ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', \"[[Three Days of Snow]]\", Ted and Barney are keeping a bar open after last call to wait for their dates and are lip-syncing to the song.\n*The [[The Simpsons (season 15)|Season 15]] episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', \"[[Today I Am a Clown]]\", features a parody of both the band and the song, with Jewish themes, during the [[Krusty the Klown]]'s [[bar mitzvah]].\n*In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode \"The Tan Aquatic with Steve Zissou\", Stewie sings the chorus of the song while inside a tanning bed.\n*In ''[[American Dad!]]'' Season 3 Episode 14 \"Office Spaceman\" Roger the alien as \"Parker Peters\" lists the islands named in the chorus of the song as destinations to go hunting for the mysterious alien (Roger himself).\n*In the episode \"Pour Judgment\" of ''[[The King of Queens]]'', the song is played during a scene where Doug attends bartender school.\n*The song is played in the episode \"The Burgers of Wrath\" of ''[[Spin City]]'', in a scene where Charlie and Carter are helping out in a fast food-restaurant.\n*In ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'' season 12 episode 11, Alan and Walden's support group sings a phrase of the song.\n*In the ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]'' episode \"Boyle-Linetti Wedding\", Charles and Lynn Boyle consider \"Kokomo\" the \"best rock-and-roll song ever written\", tied with \"[[Don't You (Forget About Me)]]\".\n* The song is heard in the episode \"Look Out for Number One\" of ''[[Orange is the New Black]]'', during a scene in which Frieda gets moved to one of the calmer cell blocks at Litchfield Penitentiary.\n* The place is mentioned in the ''[[Lana del Rey]]'' song ''[[The Greatest]]'' in the lyric: \"I miss the bar where the Beach Boys would go / Dennis' last stop before Kokomo\" referring to Kokomo as a place the singer would go after the end of his life.\n\n==Track listings==\n; 3\" CD single\n# \"Kokomo\" \u2013 3:34\n# \"Tutti Frutti\" <small>by Little

The trail consists of a series of designated roads and highways that travel along the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]]\u2014specifically, [[Lake Erie]], the [[Niagara River]], [[Lake Ontario]], and the [[Saint Lawrence River]]. It begins at the [[Ohio]] state line in rural [[Erie County, Pennsylvania]], and travels through several cities and villages (including the cities of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]], [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[Oswego, New York|Oswego]], and [[Ogdensburg, New York|Ogdensburg]]) before ending at the [[Seaway International Bridge]] northeast of the [[Massena (village), New York|village of Massena]] in [[St. Lawrence County, New York]]. It is maintained by the non-profit Seaway Trail, Inc.\n\nThe Seaway Trail was first designated in 1978 as an {{convert|80|mi|0|adj=on}} byway leading from the [[Seaway International Bridge]] to the [[Thousand Islands Bridge]]. It was extended southwestward across the state of New York in the mid-1980s and into Pennsylvania in 1996. The byway is recognized as a state scenic byway by both New York and Pennsylvania (the latter designation coming in 2003) and was named a National Scenic Byway in two stages. In New York, the Seaway Trail became one of the first byways in the nation to be declared a National Scenic Byway when it received the distinction in 1996. The Pennsylvania portion of the byway was added in 2005. The Seaway Trail was officially renamed the Great Lakes Seaway Trail in 2010.\n\n==Route description==\n[[File:PA 5 - Seaway Trl westbound.jpg|thumb|left|[[Reassurance marker]]s for the Seaway Trail and the [[Lake Erie Circle Tour]] on PA&nbsp;5 westbound]]\nThe interstate Seaway Trail extends for {{convert|64|mi|0}} in Pennsylvania and {{convert|454|mi|0}} in New York for a total of {{convert|518|mi|0}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.byways.org/explore/byways/2289/ |title=Great Lakes Seaway Trail \u2013 Pennsylvania |work=[[National Scenic Byways Program]] |publisher=[[United States Department of Transportation]] |accessdate=November 20, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.byways.org/explore/byways/2200/ |title=Great Lakes Seaway Trail \u2013 New York |work=National Scenic Byways Program |publisher=United States Department of Transportation |accessdate=November 20, 2010}}</ref> It traverses a total of 11 counties as it crosses the two states; however, all but one\u2014[[Erie County, Pennsylvania]]\u2014is located in New York.

It soon picks up [[New York State Route 266|NY&nbsp;266]] and follows it to the tip of Lake Erie.  Now paralleling the [[Niagara River]], going north, the trail follows Route&nbsp;266 through the town of [[Tonawanda (town), New York|Tonawanda]] and into the [[Tonawanda (city), New York|city of Tonawanda]], a Buffalo suburb.  Just before crossing [[Tonawanda Creek]], which forms the county line, Route&nbsp;266 ends and the Seaway Trail picks up [[New York State Route 265|NY&nbsp;265]] to cross the creek and the border.<ref name=NYmap />\n\nPoints of interest along the Chautauqua County piece of the trail include the [[Barcelona (Portland Harbor) Light|Barcelona Lighthouse]] in [[Westfield, New York (village)|Westfield]], [[Lake Erie State Park]], and the city of [[Dunkirk, New York|Dunkirk]]. Nearby is the [[Chautauqua Institution]], the [[Midway Park]] amusement park, and the city of [[Jamestown, New York|Jamestown]]. In Erie County, aside from the many attractions in the city of Buffalo, nearby destinations include [[Ralph Wilson Stadium]] in [[Orchard Park (town), New York|Orchard Park]] and a series of three museums in [[East Aurora, New York|East Aurora]].  Hamburg features a visitors center and overlook, the [http://www.lakeerieseawaytrail.com Lake Erie Seaway Trail Center], on the Lake Erie shoreline.

Both routes run along River Road very close to the eastern fork of the Niagara River (around [[Grand Island, New York|Grand Island]]).  The road curves to the west toward [[Niagara Falls]].  River Road becomes Buffalo Avenue when it enters the city of [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]], and soon Route&nbsp;265 splits off to the north.  Route&nbsp;384 continues westward, where the Seaway Trail picks up the [[Robert Moses State Parkway]] at its eastern terminus at the northern Grand Island bridge, which carries [[Interstate 190 (New York)|Interstate&nbsp;190]] (I-190).<ref name=NYmap />\n\nThe Robert Moses Parkway follows extremely close to the river to Quay Street; continuing west would take drivers directly into [[Niagara Falls State Park]], but the Seaway Trail instead uses Quay Street to access Rainbow Boulevard, which was once part of NY&nbsp;384. Rainbow Boulevard turns north and ends at [[New York State Route 104|NY&nbsp;104]] (Main Street) just east of the [[Rainbow Bridge (Niagara Falls)|Rainbow Bridge]] to [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]], Canada.<ref name=NYmap />\n\nThe Seaway Trail continues north on Route&nbsp;104 to [[New York State Route 18F|NY&nbsp;18F]] in the [[Lewiston (village), New York|village of Lewiston]]. Route&nbsp;18F jogs west and north through Lewiston and then north to [[Youngstown, New York|Youngstown]].  North of Youngstown, Route&nbsp;18F comes very close to the mouth of the Niagara River and swings eastward, now following the Lake Ontario shoreline.  Route&nbsp;18F ends a short distance east of the river's mouth at [[New York State Route 18|NY&nbsp;18]].  Route&nbsp;18 hosts the Seaway Trail for the rest of its length in Niagara County, which is almost {{convert|30|mi|km}}.<ref name=NYmap />\n\nAside from the Falls themselves, and the twin cities of Niagara Falls on either side of the border, nearby attractions include [[Artpark]] in Lewiston, the Erie Canal Junction at Tonawanda Creek, the [[Herschell Carrousel Factory Museum]] in North Tonawanda, [[Fort Niagara]] in Youngstown, and [[Golden Hill State Park]] in [[Somerset, New York|Somerset]].  There are also several historic lighthouses along the route.  Not far away, Erie Canal tours are offered out of the [[Lockport (city), New York|city of Lockport]].<ref name=NYmap /><ref name=BrochureMap2 />\n\n====Orleans County====\n[[File:NY 104 at NY 18 1.jpg|thumb|Descending the [[Niagara Escarpment]] on NY&nbsp;104 and the Seaway Trail, marked on the second assembly]]\nThe Seaway Trail follows Route&nbsp;18 eastward about halfway through Orleans County, where it switches onto the [[Lake Ontario State Parkway]] at its western terminus.  The Parkway continues east, coming very close to the Lake Ontario shore at times, until crossing the border into Monroe County.<ref name=NYmap />\n\nOrleans County is largely rural; attractions include the [[Cobblestone Society Museum]] complex in [[Childs, New York|Childs]], the Historic Courthouse Square in the county seat of [[Albion (village), New York|Albion]], [[Oak Orchard River|Point Breeze]], and two state parks: [[Lakeside Beach State Park]] and the [[Oak Orchard State Marine Park]]. Some distance to the south, straddling the [[Genesee County, New York|Genesee County]] border, is the [[Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge]].<ref name=NYmap /><ref name=BrochureMap2 />\n\n====Monroe County====\n[[File:East end of Lake Ontario Pkwy.jpg|thumb|left|Seaway Trail and War of 1812 reassurance markers at the east end of the Lake Ontario Parkway in [[Charlotte, Rochester, New York|Charlotte]]]]\nThe Seaway Trail continues along the Lake Ontario State Parkway to its eastern terminus just inside the city of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]].  The trail crosses Lake Avenue and onto the [[Colonel Patrick O'Rorke Bridge]] over the [[Genesee River]]. Now on Pattonwood Drive, the trail almost immediately exits this narrow strip of the city and enters the town of [[Irondequoit, New York|Irondequoit]].<ref name=NYmap />\n\nThe Seaway Trail meanders along Lake Shore Road through northern Irondequoit and the city-owned [[Durand&ndash;Eastman Park]] and Sweet Fern Drive to Culver Road.  The trail takes Culver Road south, away from Lake Ontario, in order to go around [[Irondequoit Bay]].  At Empire Boulevard, the trail starts eastward again.  [[New York State Route 404|NY&nbsp;404]] begins a short distance along Empire Boulevard, and the trail follows them east and north-northeast along the shore of the bay.  The trail next follows Bay Road, staying close to the bay shore, north-northwest to its terminus at [[Lake Road (Western New York)|Lake Road]], just a tenth of a mile (.15&nbsp;km) from Lake Ontario.<ref name=NYmap />\n\n[[File:Culver Rd near NY 104.jpg|thumb|right|Northbound on Culver Road in Irondequoit]]\nAlternately, during the winter months, Seaway Trail travelers can take Culver Road approximately {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} north to ward the lake shore, cross the seasonal [[Irondequoit Bay Outlet Bridge]] to Lake Road and rejoin the normal Seaway Trail in approximately {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} at the intersection of Bay Road. The route avoids the longer trip ({{convert|11.8|mi|1|disp=or}}) around the bay to the south and takes in additional scenic landmarks such as [[Seabreeze Amusement Park]] and the jetties at the outlet.<ref name=NYmap />\n\nIn either case, Lake Road carries the Seaway Trail eastward along the northern edge of the [[Webster (town), New York|town of Webster]] to the county line.<ref name=NYmap />\n\nThe Seaway Trail travels through only a small sliver of the city of Rochester, but the bulk of the city is not far to the south and contains numerous attractions.  Aside from those, attractions near the trail route include [[Hamlin Beach State Park]], more lighthouses, and [[Seabreeze Amusement Park]].  Not far away, south of Rochester, are the [[Genesee Country Village and Museum]], the [[New York Museum of Transportation]], and [[Mendon Ponds Park]].<ref name=NYmap /><ref name=BrochureMap2 />\n\n====Wayne, Cayuga and Oswego Counties====\nFrom County Line Road, Seaway Trail continues along Lake Road passing the [[Ginna Nuclear Generating Station]] (3.4 miles) and on to [[Sodus Point, New York|Sodus Point]], on the shores of [[Sodus Bay]].  There, the trail takes [[New York State Route 14|NY&nbsp;14]] south to [[Ridge Road (Western New York)|Ridge Road]].  \"The Ridge\" heads east through the [[Wolcott (village), New York|village of Wolcott]] to its eastern terminus at [[New York State Route 370|NY&nbsp;370]].  Route&nbsp;370 takes the trail north less than one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) to its northern terminus at [[New York State Route 104|NY&nbsp;104]].  [[New York State Route 104A|NY&nbsp;104A]] begins here and picks up the Seaway Trail designation.  Route&nbsp;104A takes the trail north toward the lake shore, through the village of [[Red Creek, New York|Red Creek]], but turns northeast and hits the county line still some distance from the lake.<ref name=NYmap />\n\nThe Seaway Trail enters Cayuga County heading northeast along Route&nbsp;104A and soon enters the village of [[Fair Haven, New York|Fair Haven]], on the southern shore of Little Sodus Bay.  Route&nbsp;104A turns east toward the hamlet of [[Sterling, New York|Sterling]], then north again before again moving northeast, paralleling the Lake Ontario shore at a distance of about two miles (3.5&nbsp;km).  Just a mile later, Route&nbsp;104A hits the county line. Continuing northeast, Route&nbsp;104A terminates at its parent route, NY&nbsp;104, which previously carried the Seaway Trail in Niagara Falls and here does so again.  Route&nbsp;104 continues Route&nbsp;104A's northeastern path, gradually getting closer to the lake shore, until it enters the city of [[Oswego, New York|Oswego]].  Crossing the [[Oswego River (New York)|Oswego River]], Route&nbsp;104 continues eastward.<ref name=NYmap />\n\n[[File:NY 3 north near Pulaski.jpg|thumb|Crossing over the Salmon River on NY&nbsp;3 and the Seaway Trail]]\nJust before the hamlet of [[New Haven, New York|New Haven]], the Seaway Trail veers northeast onto [[New York State Route 104B|NY&nbsp;104B]] at its western terminus.  Route&nbsp;104B approaches the lake shore again as it heads toward the hamlet of [[Texas, New York|Texas]]. The route ends at [[New York State Route 3|NY&nbsp;3]] east of Texas.  The Seaway Trail follows Route&nbsp;3 northeast, then north, crossing the [[Salmon River (New York)|Salmon River]] at Port Ontario.  Route&nbsp;3 continues north across the county line.<ref name=NYmap />\n\nWayne County is largely rural. Attractions here include the [[Sodus Point Light|Sodus Point lighthouse]], boating on Sodus Bay, and [[Chimney Bluffs State Park]].  A bit farther south is the [[Palmyra (town), New York|town of Palmyra]], where the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] ([[Mormonism]]) began in 1830. To the direct east, Cayuga County is relatively thin near Lake Ontario, so the Seaway Trail doesn't take long to pass through it.  [[Fair Haven Beach State Park]] is nearby, and in July and August, travelers can visit the [[Sterling Renaissance Festival]].<ref name=NYmap /><ref name=BrochureMap2 /> The city of Oswego in Oswego County contains several attractions, including [[Fort Ontario]].  There is a lighthouse at Port Ontario, and the village of [[Pulaski, New York|Pulaski]] is nearby.<ref name=NYmap /><ref name=BrochureMap1>{{cite web |url=http://www.seawaytrail.com/drivingmap2.pdf |title=Driving Map \u2013 Eastern Section of Byway |accessdate=October 23, 2006 |format=PDF |work=Seaway Trail Driving Map and Brochure |publisher=Seaway Trail, Inc. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019164922/http://www.seawaytrail.com/drivingmap2.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate=October 19, 2006}}</ref>\n\n====Jefferson County====\nRoute&nbsp;3 continues to carry the Seaway Trail north along the eastern shore of Lake Ontario.  East of [[Sackets Harbor, New York|Sackets Harbor]], Route&nbsp;3 turns east toward the city of [[Watertown, New York|Watertown]].  The Seaway Trail instead turns north again along [[New York State Route 180|NY&nbsp;180]].  Just north of the village of [[Dexter, New York|Dexter]], the trail turns northwest along [[New York State Route 12E|NY&nbsp;12E]].  Route&nbsp;12E passes through the village of [[Chaumont, New York|Chaumont]] and turns west around [[Chaumont Bay]], then turns northwest again to [[Cape Vincent (village), New York|Cape Vincent]]. Here, Route&nbsp;12E turns sharply to the northeast, just an eighth of a mile (200&nbsp;m) from the shore at the headwaters of the St. Lawrence River.  Canada, specifically [[Wolfe Island (Ontario)|Wolfe Island]], is just across a narrow channel.  Route&nbsp;12E continues northeast along the river.  Route&nbsp;12E ends at its parent route, [[New York State Route 12|NY&nbsp;12]], in the [[Clayton (village), New York|village of Clayton]].  Route&nbsp;12 continues to carry the Seaway Trail northeast to the county line, passing through [[Alexandria Bay, New York|Alexandria Bay]].<ref name=NYmap />\n\n[[File:NY 12E north at Cape Vincent.jpg|thumb|left|The sharp, 90-degree turn on NY&nbsp;12E in Cape Vincent. Lake Ontario is visible in the background.]]\nSeaway Trail, Inc., is headquartered in Sackets Harbor, and the Seaway Trail Discovery Center is located there.  There are several lighthouses along this section of the trail, and the [[Thousand Islands]] resort region begins here.  The city of Watertown, not far from the trail, has several attractions as well.  Nearby state parks include [[Southwick Beach State Park]], [[Westcott Beach State Park]], [[Long Point State Park &ndash; Thousand Islands|Long Point State Park]], [[Burnham Point State Park]], [[Cedar Point State Park]], [[Grass Point State Park]], [[Wellesley Island State Park]], [[Keewaydin State Park]], and [[Kring Point State Park]].<ref name=NYmap /><ref name=BrochureMap1 />\n\n====St. Lawrence County====\nThe Seaway Trail enters the state's largest county along Route&nbsp;12, heading northeast.  It passes through [[Chippewa Bay, New York|Chippewa Bay]] and [[Oak Point, New York|Oak Point]] before reaching [[New York State Route 37|NY&nbsp;37]], Route&nbsp;12's northern terminus.  The trail continues northeast along Route&nbsp;37 to just outside the city of [[Ogdensburg, New York|Ogdensburg]].  There, it follows [[New York State Route 68|NY&nbsp;68]], the Downtown Arterial Highway, which runs closer to the St. Lawrence River than Route&nbsp;37.  After crossing the [[Oswegatchie River]] mouth, the trail leaves Route&nbsp;68 and winds its way through the western half of the city, eventually reaching [[New York State Route 812|NY&nbsp;812]], which it traverses for a fifth of a mile (300&nbsp;m) to get back to Route&nbsp;37.<ref name=NYmap />\n\n[[File:NY 37 at NY 131.jpg|thumb|NY&nbsp;37 east at NY&nbsp;131, where the Seaway Trail turns to follow the latter]]\nRoute&nbsp;37 continues northeast and starts to turn slightly eastward as it approaches the top of New York State, passing through the [[Waddington (village), New York|village of Waddington]].  At [[New York State Route 131|NY&nbsp;131]]'s western terminus, the trail switches to Route&nbsp;131, which runs north of the [[Massena (village), New York|village of Massena]] rather than through it.  Past the city, Route&nbsp;131 turns south toward its eastern terminus at Route&nbsp;37.  Route&nbsp;37 then carries the trail to the hamlet of Rooseveltown in the [[Massena (town), New York|town of Massena]], where the Seaway Trail ends just shy of the Franklin County line.<ref name=NYmap />\n\nTravelers finding themselves at the end of the trail can cross the border into Canada on the [[Seaway International Bridge]], traversing a thin wedge of Quebec before ending up in [[Cornwall, Ontario]].  This is the point at which New York's northern border straightens out and proceeds due east (along the [[45th parallel north]]) rather than following the St. Lawrence River, which cuts through Quebec.<ref name=NYmap />\n\nAttractions along this northeasternmost segment of the Seaway Trail include [[Singer Castle]], the [[Frederic Remington]] [[Frederic Remington Art Museum|Art Museum]] in Ogdensburg, the [[Eisenhower Locks]] on the river near Massena, and a few more historic lighthouses.  State parks in this area include [[Jacques Cartier State Park]], [[Eel Weir State Park]], [[Coles Creek State Park]], [[St. Lawrence State Park Golf Course|St. Lawrence State Park]], and [[Robert Moses State Park (Thousand Islands)|Robert Moses State Park]].

The trail consists of a series of designated roads and highways that travel along the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]]\u2014specifically, [[Lake Erie]], the [[Niagara River]], [[Lake Ontario]], and the [[Saint Lawrence River]]. It begins at the [[Ohio]] state line in rural [[Erie County, Pennsylvania]], and travels through several cities and villages (including the cities of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]], [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[Oswego, New York|Oswego]], and [[Ogdensburg, New York|Ogdensburg]]) before ending at the [[Seaway International Bridge]] northeast of the [[Massena (village), New York|village of Massena]] in [[St. Lawrence County, New York]]. It is maintained by the non-profit Seaway Trail, Inc.\n\nThe Seaway Trail was first designated in 1978 as an {{convert|80|mi|0|adj=on}} byway leading from the [[Seaway International Bridge]] to the [[Thousand Islands Bridge]]. It was extended southwestward across the state of New York in the mid-1980s and into Pennsylvania in 1996. The byway is recognized as a state scenic byway by both New York and Pennsylvania (the latter designation coming in 2003) and was named a National Scenic Byway in two stages. In New York, the Seaway Trail became one of the first byways in the nation to be declared a National Scenic Byway when it received the distinction in 1996. The Pennsylvania portion of the byway was added in 2005. The Seaway Trail was officially renamed the Great Lakes Seaway Trail in 2010.\n\n==Route description==\n[[File:PA 5 - Seaway Trl westbound.jpg|thumb|left|[[Reassurance marker]]s for the Seaway Trail and the [[Lake Erie Circle Tour]] on PA&nbsp;5 westbound]]\nThe interstate Seaway Trail extends for {{convert|64|mi|0}} in Pennsylvania and {{convert|454|mi|0}} in New York for a total of {{convert|518|mi|0}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.byways.org/explore/byways/2289/ |title=Great Lakes Seaway Trail \u2013 Pennsylvania |work=[[National Scenic Byways Program]] |publisher=[[United States Department of Transportation]] |accessdate=November 20, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.byways.org/explore/byways/2200/ |title=Great Lakes Seaway Trail \u2013 New York |work=National Scenic Byways Program |publisher=United States Department of Transportation |accessdate=November 20, 2010}}</ref> It traverses a total of 11 counties as it crosses the two states; however, all but one\u2014[[Erie County, Pennsylvania]]\u2014is located in New York.

It soon picks up [[New York State Route 266|NY&nbsp;266]] and follows it to the tip of Lake Erie.  Now paralleling the [[Niagara River]], going north, the trail follows Route&nbsp;266 through the town of [[Tonawanda (town), New York|Tonawanda]] and into the [[Tonawanda (city), New York|city of Tonawanda]], a Buffalo suburb.  Just before crossing [[Tonawanda Creek]], which forms the county line, Route&nbsp;266 ends and the Seaway Trail picks up [[New York State Route 265|NY&nbsp;265]] to cross the creek and the border.<ref name=NYmap />\n\nPoints of interest along the Chautauqua County piece of the trail include the [[Barcelona (Portland Harbor) Light|Barcelona Lighthouse]] in [[Westfield, New York (village)|Westfield]], [[Lake Erie State Park]], and the city of [[Dunkirk, New York|Dunkirk]].

Both routes run along River Road very close to the eastern fork of the Niagara River (around [[Grand Island, New York|Grand Island]]).  The road curves to the west toward [[Niagara Falls]].  River Road becomes Buffalo Avenue when it enters the city of [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]], and soon Route&nbsp;265 splits off to the north.  Route&nbsp;384 continues westward, where the Seaway Trail picks up the [[Robert Moses State Parkway]] at its eastern terminus at the northern Grand Island bridge, which carries [[Interstate 190 (New York)|Interstate&nbsp;190]] (I-190).<ref name=NYmap />\n\nThe Robert Moses Parkway follows extremely close to the river to Quay Street; continuing west would take drivers directly into [[Niagara Falls State Park]], but the Seaway Trail instead uses Quay Street to access Rainbow Boulevard, which was once part of NY&nbsp;384. Rainbow Boulevard turns north and ends at [[New York State Route 104|NY&nbsp;104]] (Main Street) just east of the [[Rainbow Bridge (Niagara Falls)|Rainbow Bridge]] to [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]], Canada.<ref name=NYmap />\n\nThe Seaway Trail continues north on Route&nbsp;104 to [[New York State Route 18F|NY&nbsp;18F]] in the [[Lewiston (village), New York|village of Lewiston]]. Route&nbsp;18F jogs west and north through Lewiston and then north to [[Youngstown, New York|Youngstown]].  North of Youngstown, Route&nbsp;18F comes very close to the mouth of the Niagara River and swings eastward, now following the Lake Ontario shoreline.  Route&nbsp;18F ends a short distance east of the river's mouth at [[New York State Route 18|NY&nbsp;18]].  Route&nbsp;18 hosts the Seaway Trail for the rest of its length in Niagara County, which is almost {{convert|30|mi|km}}.<ref name=NYmap />\n\nAside from the Falls themselves, and the twin cities of Niagara Falls on either side of the border, nearby attractions include [[Artpark]] in Lewiston, the Erie Canal Junction at Tonawanda Creek, the [[Herschell Carrousel Factory Museum]] in North Tonawanda, [[Fort Niagara]] in Youngstown, and [[Golden Hill State Park]] in [[Somerset, New York|Somerset]].  There are also several historic lighthouses along the route.

The Parkway continues east, coming very close to the Lake Ontario shore at times, until crossing the border into Monroe County.<ref name=NYmap />\n\nOrleans County is largely rural; attractions include the [[Cobblestone Society Museum]] complex in [[Childs, New York|Childs]], the Historic Courthouse Square in the county seat of [[Albion (village), New York|Albion]], [[Oak Orchard River|Point Breeze]], and two state parks: [[Lakeside Beach State Park]] and the [[Oak Orchard State Marine Park]]. Some distance to the south, straddling the [[Genesee County, New York|Genesee County]] border, is the [[Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge]].<ref name=NYmap /><ref name=BrochureMap2 />\n\n====Monroe County====\n[[File:East end of Lake Ontario Pkwy.jpg|thumb|left|Seaway Trail and War of 1812 reassurance markers at the east end of the Lake Ontario Parkway in [[Charlotte, Rochester, New York|Charlotte]]]]\nThe Seaway Trail continues along the Lake Ontario State Parkway to its eastern terminus just inside the city of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]].  The trail crosses Lake Avenue and onto the [[Colonel Patrick O'Rorke Bridge]] over the [[Genesee River]]. Now on Pattonwood Drive, the trail almost immediately exits this narrow strip of the city and enters the town of [[Irondequoit, New York|Irondequoit]].<ref name=NYmap />\n\nThe Seaway Trail meanders along Lake Shore Road through northern Irondequoit and the city-owned [[Durand&ndash;Eastman Park]] and Sweet Fern Drive to Culver Road.  The trail takes Culver Road south, away from Lake Ontario, in order to go around [[Irondequoit Bay]].  At Empire Boulevard, the trail starts eastward again.  [[New York State Route 404|NY&nbsp;404]] begins a short distance along Empire Boulevard, and the trail follows them east and north-northeast along the shore of the bay.  The trail next follows Bay Road, staying close to the bay shore, north-northwest to its terminus at [[Lake Road (Western New York)|Lake Road]], just a tenth of a mile (.15&nbsp;km) from Lake Ontario.<ref name=NYmap />\n\n[[File:Culver Rd near NY 104.jpg|thumb|right|Northbound on Culver Road in Irondequoit]]\nAlternately, during the winter months, Seaway Trail travelers can take Culver Road approximately {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} north to ward the lake shore, cross the seasonal [[Irondequoit Bay Outlet Bridge]] to Lake Road and rejoin the normal Seaway Trail in approximately {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} at the intersection of Bay Road. The route avoids the longer trip ({{convert|11.8|mi|1|disp=or}}) around the bay to the south and takes in additional scenic landmarks such as [[Seabreeze Amusement Park]] and the jetties at the outlet.<ref name=NYmap />\n\nIn either case, Lake Road carries the Seaway Trail eastward along the northern edge of the [[Webster (town), New York|town of Webster]] to the county line.<ref name=NYmap />\n\nThe Seaway Trail travels though only a small sliver of the city of Rochester, but the bulk of the city is not far to the south and contains numerous attractions.  Aside from those, attractions near the trail route include [[Hamlin Beach State Park]], more lighthouses, and [[Seabreeze Amusement Park]].  Not far away, south of Rochester, are the [[Genesee Country Village and Museum]], the [[New York Museum of Transportation]], and [[Mendon Ponds Park]].<ref name=NYmap /><ref name=BrochureMap2 />\n\n====Wayne, Cayuga and Oswego Counties====\nFrom County Line Road, Seaway Trail continues along Lake Road passing the [[Ginna Nuclear Generating Station]] (3.4 miles) and on to [[Sodus Point, New York|Sodus Point]], on the shores of [[Sodus Bay]].  There, the trail takes [[New York State Route 14|NY&nbsp;14]] south to [[Ridge Road (Western New York)|Ridge Road]].  \"The Ridge\" heads east through the [[Wolcott (village), New York|village of Wolcott]] to its eastern terminus at [[New York State Route 370|NY&nbsp;370]].  Route&nbsp;370 takes the trail north less than one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) to its northern terminus at [[New York State Route 104|NY&nbsp;104]].  [[New York State Route 104A|NY&nbsp;104A]] begins here and picks up the Seaway Trail designation.  Route&nbsp;104A takes the trail north toward the lake shore, through the village of [[Red Creek, New York|Red Creek]], but turns northeast and hits the county line still some distance from the lake.<ref name=NYmap />\n\nThe Seaway Trail enters Cayuga County heading northeast along Route&nbsp;104A and soon enters the village of [[Fair Haven, New York|Fair Haven]], on the southern shore of Little Sodus Bay.  Route&nbsp;104A turns east toward the hamlet of [[Sterling, New York|Sterling]], then north again before again moving northeast, paralleling the Lake Ontario shore at a distance of about two miles (3.5&nbsp;km).  Just a mile later, Route&nbsp;104A hits the county line. Continuing northeast, Route&nbsp;104A terminates at its parent route, NY&nbsp;104, which previously carried the Seaway Trail in Niagara Falls and here does so again.  Route&nbsp;104 continues Route&nbsp;104A's northeastern path, gradually getting closer to the lake shore, until it enters the city of [[Oswego, New York|Oswego]].  Crossing the [[Oswego River (New York)|Oswego River]], Route&nbsp;104 continues eastward.<ref name=NYmap />\n\n[[File:NY 3 north near Pulaski.jpg|thumb|Crossing over the Salmon River on NY&nbsp;3 and the Seaway Trail]]\nJust before the hamlet of [[New Haven, New York|New Haven]], the Seaway Trail veers northeast onto [[New York State Route 104B|NY&nbsp;104B]] at its western terminus.  Route&nbsp;104B approaches the lake shore again as it heads toward the hamlet of [[Texas, New York|Texas]]. The route ends at [[New York State Route 3|NY&nbsp;3]] east of Texas.  The Seaway Trail follows Route&nbsp;3 northeast, then north, crossing the [[Salmon River (New York)|Salmon River]] at Port Ontario.  Route&nbsp;3 continues north across the county line.<ref name=NYmap />\n\nWayne County is largely rural. Attractions here include the [[Sodus Point Light|Sodus Point lighthouse]], boating on Sodus Bay, and [[Chimney Bluffs State Park]].  A bit farther south is the [[Palmyra (town), New York|town of Palmyra]], where the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] ([[Mormonism]]) began in 1830. To the direct east, Cayuga County is relatively thin near Lake Ontario, so the Seaway Trail doesn't take long to pass through it.

East of [[Sackets Harbor, New York|Sackets Harbor]], Route&nbsp;3 turns east toward the city of [[Watertown, New York|Watertown]].  The Seaway Trail instead turns north again along [[New York State Route 180|NY&nbsp;180]].  Just north of the village of [[Dexter, New York|Dexter]], the trail turns northwest along [[New York State Route 12E|NY&nbsp;12E]].  Route&nbsp;12E passes through the village of [[Chaumont, New York|Chaumont]] and turns west around [[Chaumont Bay]], then turns northwest again to [[Cape Vincent (village), New York|Cape Vincent]]. Here, Route&nbsp;12E turns sharply to the northeast, just an eighth of a mile (200&nbsp;m) from the shore at the headwaters of the St. Lawrence River.  Canada, specifically [[Wolfe Island (Ontario)|Wolfe Island]], is just across a narrow channel.  Route&nbsp;12E continues northeast along the river.  Route&nbsp;12E ends at its parent route, [[New York State Route 12|NY&nbsp;12]], in the [[Clayton (village), New York|village of Clayton]].  Route&nbsp;12 continues to carry the Seaway Trail northeast to the county line, passing through [[Alexandria Bay, New York|Alexandria Bay]].<ref name=NYmap />\n\n[[File:NY 12E north at Cape Vincent.jpg|thumb|left|The sharp, 90-degree turn on NY&nbsp;12E in Cape Vincent.

There are several lighthouses along this section of the trail, and the [[Thousand Islands]] resort region begins here.  The city of Watertown, not far from the trail, has several attractions as well.  Nearby state parks include [[Southwick Beach State Park]], [[Westcott Beach State Park]], [[Long Point State Park &ndash; Thousand Islands|Long Point State Park]], [[Burnham Point State Park]], [[Cedar Point State Park]], [[Grass Point State Park]], [[Wellesley Island State Park]], [[Keewaydin State Park]], and [[Kring Point State Park]].<ref name=NYmap /><ref name=BrochureMap1 />\n\n====St. Lawrence County====\nThe Seaway Trail enters the state's largest county along Route&nbsp;12, heading northeast.  It passes through [[Chippewa Bay, New York|Chippewa Bay]] and [[Oak Point, New York|Oak Point]] before reaching [[New York State Route 37|NY&nbsp;37]], Route&nbsp;12's northern terminus.  The trail continues northeast along Route&nbsp;37 to just outside the city of [[Ogdensburg, New York|Ogdensburg]].  There, it follows [[New York State Route 68|NY&nbsp;68]], the Downtown Arterial Highway, which runs closer to the St. Lawrence River than Route&nbsp;37.  After crossing the [[Oswegatchie River]] mouth, the trail leaves Route&nbsp;68 and winds its way through the western half of the city, eventually reaching [[New York State Route 812|NY&nbsp;812]], which it traverses for a fifth of a mile (300&nbsp;m) to get back to Route&nbsp;37.<ref name=NYmap />\n\n[[File:NY 37 at NY 131.jpg|thumb|NY&nbsp;37 east at NY&nbsp;131, where the Seaway Trail turns to follow the latter]]\nRoute&nbsp;37 continues northeast and starts to turn slightly eastward as it approaches the top of New York State, passing through the [[Waddington (village), New York|village of Waddington]].  At [[New York State Route 131|NY&nbsp;131]]'s western terminus, the trail switches to Route&nbsp;131, which runs north of the [[Massena (village), New York|village of Massena]] rather than through it.  Past the city, Route&nbsp;131 turns south toward its eastern terminus at Route&nbsp;37.  Route&nbsp;37 then carries the trail to the hamlet of Rooseveltown in the [[Massena (town), New York|town of Massena]], where the Seaway Trail ends just shy of the Franklin County line.<ref name=NYmap />\n\nTravelers finding themselves at the end of the trail can cross the border into Canada on the [[Seaway International Bridge]], traversing a thin wedge of Quebec before ending up in [[Cornwall, Ontario]].  This is the point at which New York's northern border straightens out and proceeds due east (along the [[45th parallel north]]) rather than following the St. Lawrence River, which cuts through Quebec.<ref name=NYmap />\n\nAttractions along this northeasternmost segment of the Seaway Trail include [[Singer Castle]], the [[Frederic Remington]] [[Frederic Remington Art Museum|Art Museum]] in Ogdensburg, the [[Eisenhower Locks]] on the river near Massena, and a few more historic lighthouses.  State parks in this area include [[Jacques Cartier State Park]], [[Eel Weir State Park]], [[Coles Creek State Park]], [[St. Lawrence State Park Golf Course|St. Lawrence State Park]], and [[Robert Moses State Park (Thousand Islands)|Robert Moses State Park]].

At the E end of the mound only two contiguous stones, apparently the N side of a gallery, remain. The overall length of the orthostatic structure would suggest that this was a dual court tomb.

The genus is named after [[Giovanni Antonio Scopoli|Giovanni Scopoli]] (1723\u201388), a [[county of Tyrol|Tyrol]]ean [[Natural history|naturalist]].\nThe genus has a disjunct distribution, with two recognised species in [[Central Europe|Central]] to [[Eastern Europe]], (including the [[Caucasus]]), and two species in [[East Asia]].\nThe two European species are:\n*''[[Scopolia carniolica]]'' <small>Jacq.</small> of [[Slovenia]], [[Austria]] and the [[Carpathian Mountains]]\n*''[[Scopolia caucasica]]'' <small>Kolesn. ex Kreyer</small> of the [[Caucasus]]\nand the two Asiatic species are:\n*''[[Scopolia lutescens]]'' <small>Y.N.

Scopolia's extract (which contains a form of the alkaloid [[scopolamine]]) is used in at least one commercial stomach remedy ([[Inosea]], produced by [[Sato Pharmaceutical]]).  The extract is an anti-spasmodic in low doses and may be used to relax smooth muscle tissue or prevent motion-sickness induced nausea; in higher doses it is a poison having hallucinogenic and memory-inhibiting effects.\n\nOther alkaloids found in ''Scopolia carniolica'' include [[cuscohygrine]][[hyoscyamine]] and [[atroscine]].\n\nThe coumarin [[phenylpropanoid]]s [[umbelliferone]] and [[scopoletin]] have been isolated from the roots of ''Scopolia japonica''.\n\n\n==''Scopolia carniolica'' compared and contrasted with ''Atropa belladonna''==\n[[File:IMG 5034 Scopolia carniolica Jacq.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Single flower of ''Scopolia carniolica'', showing hairless, cup-shaped, only faintly-lobed calyx and cream-veined, purple-brown corolla]]\n[[File:IMG 8028 Atropa belladonna L.

{"title_page": "Pre-Columbian history of Costa Rica", "text_new": "{{Use American English|date = February 2019}}\n{{Short description|Costa Rica before Spanish colonization}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}\n{{Refimprove|date=December 2008}}\n\nThe '''pre-Columbian history of [[Costa Rica]]''' extends from the establishment of the first settlers until the arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] to the Americas.\n\nArchaeological evidence allows us to date the arrival of the first humans to Costa Rica to between 7000 and 10,000 BC. By the second millennium BC sedentary farming communities already existed. Between 300 BC and AD 300 many communities moved from a tribal, clan-centric organization \u2013 kinship-based, rarely hierarchical and dependent on self-sustenance \u2013 to a hierarchical one, with ''[[cacique]]s'' (chiefs), religious leaders or shamans, artisan specialists and so on. This social organization arose from the need to organize manufacture and trade, manage relations with other communities and plan offensive and defensive activities. These groups established broader territorial divisions to produce more food and control wider sources of raw materials.\n\nFrom the 9th century certain villages grew in size, and the latter-period chiefdoms of the 16th century came to develop greater social hierarchies and major improvements in infrastructure.\n\n==Ancient history==\n\n===First settlers===\n\nThe presence of humans in the Americas was a much later phenomenon than on other continents. The first humans are barely dated to around 40,000 to 50,000 BC, and it is suggested a later date. In any case, the concentration of ice over the continents during the last [[last glacial period|Ice Age]] caused the oceans to recede by about 120 meters (400&nbsp;feet), allowing groups of hunters from northeast Asia to move eastward in pursuit of great herds of animals. They traveled to North America and settled there in several waves, and over the course of several millennia and through successive generations, the descendants of these hunters spread out throughout the Americas and her neighboring islands.\n\nThere is archaeological evidence that places the arrival of the first humans to Costa Rica between [[7th millennium BC|7,000]] and [[10th millennium BC|10,000]] BC. In the valley of [[Turrialba Volcano|Turrialba]] sites have been found in areas where quarry and tradesman tools such as [[biface]]s were manufactured. It is thought that these first settlers of Costa Rica belonged to small nomadic groups of around 20 to 30 members bound by kinship, which moved continually to hunt animals and gather roots and wild plants. In addition to the species that still exist today, their usual prey animals included the so-called mega-fauna such as giant [[Giant Armadillo|armadillos]], [[ground sloth|sloths]] and [[mastodon]]s.\n\n===Mesolithic Period===\n\nAround 8000 BC climatic changes brought about the end of the last [[last glacial period|Ice Age]]. The increase in temperature caused substantial changes in vegetation and saw the extinction of the mega-fauna, through either the disappearance of the plants they consumed, excessive predation by hunter or a combination of both. The [[hunter-gatherer]]s had to develop strategies to adapt to new conditions, and they continued by hunting smaller species such as [[tapir]]s, [[collared peccary]] and [[deer]]. The new wealth of tropical vegetation, moreover, helped them to survive through all times of year.\n\nIt is thought that human groups remained small, about 30 to 100 members, organized in nomadic or semi-nomadic bands devoted to hunting and gathering. However, the knowledge of the local environment allowed them to plan their travels through different areas based on the periodic ripening of certain fruits and the growth of familiar plants (that would later form the basis of agriculture) as well as the availability of other resources. Along these familiar paths they could find temporary shelter under rock ledges, or establish outdoor camps with ''tapavientos'' (windbreaker walls based on the [[podocarpus guatemalensis|cipresillo]] tree) or other temporary structures.\n\nTradesman work areas, campfire pits and other fragmentary evidence of life in these groups have been found in the [[Turrialba Volcano|Turrialba]] valley and in various spots around [[Guanacaste Province|Guanacaste]]. The manufacturing of specialized tools for various activities continued, and artifacts from this era such as scrapers, knives and spear tips display differences in form and size relative to those of the mega-fauna hunters.\n\n===Neolithic Period===\n\nBy 5000 BC it became common to farm [[tuber]]s and [[maize|corn]], as well as cultivate fruit trees and palm trees. Agriculture emerged slowly, stemming from knowledge of the annual cycles of nature and the progressive domestication of familiar plants. This development occurred over thousands of years and coexisted with traditional hunting and gathering, but it afforded a certain amount of stability. To ensure subsistence of these groups there had to exist forms of collective work and property, as well as [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] relationships.\n\nBetween 2000 BC and 300 BC, some communities of early farmers became egalitarian societies. The development of agriculture prompted changes in the relationship between humans and nature, and allowed them to feed many more people. Furthermore, the ever-growing dependence on agriculture compelled human groups to establish permanent settlements around agricultural fields. This led to stable villages of huts that had to be erected in clear areas of the forest. The agricultural system most likely employed was slash-and-burn: The forest would be cut with stone axes and spades then burned to prepare it for planting crops. Agricultural practices included vegeculture, semiculture or a combination of both.\n\n[[Vegeculture]] (cultivation of plants on stakes) came about by farming tubers ([[cassava|yucas]], [[yam (vegetable)|yam]]s, [[sweet potato]]es) and diverse palms and trees ([[avocado]]s, [[nance]]s), in combination with hunting and fishing. This activity was very stable, since it demanded few nutrients from the soil, rarely caused erosion and could be developed in hilly areas. By such means, societies based on vegeculture would change very slowly.\n\nIn contrast to vegeculture, [[semiculture]] (cultivation of plants from seeds) had a greater effect on the environment, because it required more nutrients from the soil and caused greater erosion. In return, this system had a big advantage: it make food easier to store so that it could be made available all year, not just around harvest time. This led to larger societies where functions would be diversified. The primary semicultural activity was the production of corn, as well as associated plants such as beans and ''ayotes'' (a type of gourd related to the pumpkin).\n\nThroughout the [[2nd millennium BC]] there existed in Costa Rica small, disperse villages, non-nomadic agricultural communities that used ceramic bowls and utensils, and tools made from wood, bone and stone for agricultural tasks and food preparation. The oldest of these agricultural village communities (2000\u2013500 BC) has been found in the province of [[Guanacaste Province|Guanacaste]]. More recent ones (1500\u2013300 BC) have been discovered in the [[Turrialba Volcano|Turrialba]] Valley, the coastal region of [[Gandoca]], the northern plains, [[Sarapiqu\u00ed (canton)|Sarapiqu\u00ed]] Basin, [[Barva (canton)|Barva]], [[Playa Herradura, Costa Rica|Herradura]], the [[T\u00e9rraba River]] Basin, the [[Coto Colorado River]] Basin and [[Isla del Ca\u00f1o]].\n\n==Societal evolution==\n{{multiple image|perrow=1/1/1/1|total_width=300|caption_align=center\n| image1 = Stone sphere.jpg|caption1=Stone sphere made by the Diquis culture.\n| image2 = Pre-Columbian incense burner, Costa Rica (Carlos Museum).jpg|caption2=A Pre-Columbian incense burner with a crocodile lid.\n| image3 = Ceramicas Nicoya.jpg|caption3=Pre-Columbian Ceramics from Nicoya, Costa Rica.\n| image4 = Diquis Human Effigy Pendant.jpg|caption4=A Diquis human effigy pendant.\n}}\n===Egalitarian societies===\n\nIn the beginning, the social organization of these groups would've been of a tribal or clan-based nature, with [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] relationships between individuals and organizations, in clans or groups whose members were or would consider themselves to be descended from a common ancestry. Such ties would have served as a foundation for economic and political relations; the leadership would've been informal and ownership of goods would've been collective. However, agriculture, sendentarism and a broadening demographic would've prompted the formation of higher classes of society, and the advent of leaders who built organizations well-suited to manage food production and distribution, calm disputes and so on. Important figures such as the [[shamanism|shaman]] (a kind of priest), physician and witch doctor would have overseen religious and spiritual life.\n\n===Early chiefdoms===\nWith dependency on agriculture came the need for efficient territorial control, to ensure the availability of suitable farmlands and improvement of productive techniques. Soil depletion and the consequent necessity to rotate crops, as well as a steady increase in the population, also made it essential to expand a group's sphere of territorial dominance. Almost inevitably, this brought about the rise of armed conflict with other groups.\n\nBetween 300 BC and 300 AD, many villager-egalitarian communities in Costa Rica moved from a tribal, clan-centric organization \u2013 kinship-based, rarely hierarchical and dependent on self-sustenance \u2013 to a villager-chief organization, with chiefs and elders, religious leaders or shamans, specialist artisans, people of hereditary power and so on. These chiefdoms likely arose from the need to organize production and trade, manage relations with other communities and plan offensive and defensive initiatives.\n\nThese [[chiefdom]] groups in general established territorial divisions that were more strongly demarcated than those in tribal times, and were able to expand their geographical spheres of domination to produce more food and control expanding sources of raw materials (forests, quarries, etc.). These groups also developed trading networks with other communities and regions.\n\nOther villages grew and became centers of economic, political and religious power. Some studies refer to these new forms of organization as complex chiefdoms. The appearance of these types of chiefdoms also led to higher-level hierarchies, with principal villages and secondary towns. From around 300 BC there began to appear large villages with intrastructural works of various importance (foundations, roads and burial mounds), that indicate a certain centralization of authority and managerial capacity to mobilize communities for construction tasks. There might emerge a primary chief in the dominant village and as well as secondary chiefs in subordinate villages. Among the principal archeological testaments to this era, it is fitting to mention diverse housing sites in the [[Nicoya Peninsula]], housing structures at the sites of Severo Ledesma and Las Mercedes \u2013 and on the Atlantic side, other settlement ruins in Valle del General, as well as the [[Coto Brus]], [[Coto Colorado River|Coto Colorado]] and [[T\u00e9rraba River]] basin.\n\nSeveral archeological sites in [[Guanacaste Province]] are linked to this period, particularly tombs covered in tons of stone. Similar funeral mounds have appeared in the canton of [[Grecia (canton)|Grecia]]. In other places in the [[Costa Rican Central Valley]] and along the Pacific, archeologists have uncovered housing plots delimited with rounded edges, mounds, clay floors and roads. In the south Pacific region are the famous [[stone spheres of Costa Rica]], whose purpose is still a mystery, though it is suggested that they may have been symbols of rank or territorial markers, or had an astronomical function associated with cycles of agriculture.\n\nThere was a great development in the manufacture of objects made of [[jadeite]] or so-called \"social\" [[Costa Rican jade tradition|jade]] (green or off-white stones such as [[quartz]], [[chalcedony]], [[opal]], [[serpentine group|serpentine]], etc.). It is supposed that they were used as personal ornaments then later on in individual burial clothes, since most have been found at burial sites. Deep local tradition in [[jade]]-work (which began around 500 BC and continued until around AD 700 for the most part developed without external influence, although some pieces display features of [[Olmec]] and [[Maya civilization|Maya]]n artisanship. Their motifs apparently had religious meaning. Burials from this period demonstrate the existence of rank and class, since burial offerings include artifacts made of jade and other green gemstones, ceremonial grinding stones, sceptre stones and elaborate ceramics. The number, quality and difficulty of obtaining these articles are a means of indicating the person's social rank.\n\nWith the advances in agriculture and corresponding social changes, the most successful communities established social hierarchies based on economic and political criteria. Between AD 300 and 800, these chiefdom societies developmented internal social strata, with political and religious leaders, warriors, specialized artisans and farmers. The ruling class could fill functions such as distributors for communally produced goods, military leaders, crisis counselors and so on. In any case, they usually had access to goods that were especially valuable because they were difficult to obtain or manufacture; and they were distinguished from other natives by their prominent living quarters within the villages, as well as the more elaborate funeral rites and offerings their status afforded.\n\n===Later chiefdoms===\n\nFrom the 9th century certain villages grew in size and their internal design became more complex, giving rise to the era of late pre-Columbian chiefdoms which lasted until the 16th century. It is possible that more fruitful varieties of corn and other crops, as well as more perfected agricultural methods coincided with an increase in population, a deeper social hierarchy and stronger relationships between communities further down the social chain. In some villages the ''[[cacique]]s'' or shamans promoted the infrastructure improvements that required the mobilization of immense work forces. There was a notable peak in the art of goldsmithing throughout the country. In addition there was an increase in the variety of domestic and personal goods, regional trade, alliances and territorial conflicts.\n\nAt the start of this period, Mesoamerican cultural groups began to trickle over the [[Nicoya Peninsula]], principally the [[Chorotega people]], who subordinated, displaced or mixed with populations that had previously settled in the Nicoyan territory. These new peoples introduced changes in religion, burial rites, art and other aspects of life; as well as new domesticated animals such as [[domestic turkey|turkey]]s. This period corresponds to habitation sites located in coastal valleys such as [[Nacascolo de Liberia|Nacascolo]] and [[Gulf of Papagayo|Papagayo]]; and the flood plains of the [[Tempisque River]] and other important rivers. In addition there were other places that specialized in the salt extraction, providing a precious trading commodity, especially for groups that lived inland. Skill in multi-colored [[ceramic art]] reached an advanced level; new colors and styles became available to local ceramic artisans, clearly inspired by Mesoamericana.\n\nIn the heart of Costa Rica populations became more concentrated in organized economic and political centers, that would form living and ceremonial groups.  The most well-known archeological site of this kind is [[Guayabo]] in Turrialba, which contains raised mounds with walls of stone, access ramps and pedestals, as well as aqueducts, elevated platforms, circular and rectangular foundations, paved walkways and other structures. But others have been found in widespread places in the Central Valle, the Caribbean region and the northern plains. In this era there was a great development in stonework with volcanic rocks, to make tables, stone tablets, grinding stones and anthropomorphic figures (women, heads, shamans, warriors and so forth).\n\nIn the south Pacific region have also been found great quantities of home foundations, roads, dump sites, plus funeral areas and mounds. These settlements were located in very fertile regions, bringing about the extensive cultivation of corn and cotton, and the use of palm trees (''[[scheelea butyracea|coyoles]]'' and [[roystonea|royal palms]]) and fruit trees (''[[Hymenaea courbaril|guapinoles]]'', [[nance]]s, etc.). This was the height of sphere-making, as well as of stone artisanship in such works as animal figures, grindstones, grand anthropomorphic statues (which appear to represent important social figures) that featured smooth surfaces. There was and increase in goldsmithing with ''guan\u00edn'' (low-grade gold) and ''[[tumbaga]]'' (gold and copper alloy) using hammering and thin-sheet techniques. Mineral deposits themselves were not exploited, as gold was extracted from rivers and copper from outcrops.\n\n==Societal classification==\n\nWhen the Europeans arrived, [[Costa Rica]] was not a unified land but was inhabited by diverse peoples independent from each other, and whose respective cultures had many different levels of complexity and development. The traditional view that divides this territory between the [[Chorotega people|Chorotegas]], [[Huetar people|Huetars]] and [[Boruca people|Bruncas]] has been abandoned, since these names in fact only identified a small part of the nations that existed in Costa Rican proper at the time. In light of recent studies, it has become much more appropriate to identify two major principal areas:\n\n* The ''[[Intermediate Area]]'' (or ''[[Isthmo-Colombian Area]]''), with [[Caribbean]] and South American influences\n* The ''[[Mesoamerican|Mesoamerican Area]]'', a great cultural expanse that extends from [[Chiapas]] and the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]] in present-day Mexico to the [[Nicoya Peninsula]] as well as its eponymous gulf\n\nThere is no strict boundary, either cultural or political, between the Intermediate and Mesoamerican Areas, because there would've been frequent contact and transcultural exchange between both groups of people, over all the confluent areas. Even so, notable culture differences existed between them. Some peoples in the Mesoamerican Area, for example, were organized into societies that appear more complex than those of their contemporaries in the Intermediate Area, having legal institutions which, from a Western point of view, may have been more developed. On the other hand, in both regions it appears the prevalent system of law was exclusively or almost exclusively [[consuetudinary]], based on custom rather than the rule of law. It is possible, however, that the [[Kingdom of Nicoya|indigenous Nicoyans]] preserved their legal codes by means of some writing system similar to those of other Mesoamerican cultures.\n\nPart of what we know about these societies is from reports and letters written by the Spanish [[conquistador]]s and missionaries, people whose training and mentality were borne of cultural norms very different from those of the indigenous societies, and whose view of them at times was distorted through prejudice, personal interest or mere ignorance. Such documents are not very numerous, and on occasion are superficial, fragmentary or very general; and talk about a very small number of the indigenous groups that existed.\n\n==Mesoamerican Area==\n\nIn the opening decades of the 16th century, most of the people inhabiting the Nicoya Peninsula and the vicinity of its eponymous gulf belonged to the Mesoamerican cultural area. Their presence has also been attested in the central Pacific region between the [[Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda River|Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda]] and [[T\u00e1rcoles River|T\u00e1rcoles]] Rivers. These people spoke [[Chorotega language|Chorotega]], and this is why sometimes they are generically designated as such. Furthermore, in the vicinity of modern-day [[Bagaces (canton)|Bagaces]], at the mouth of the [[San Juan River (Nicaragua)|San Juan River]] and the [[Sixaola River]] basin there were enclaves of groups with Mexican cultural roots who spoke [[N\u00e1huatl]]. According to several documents from the second half of the 16th century, the [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] colony in Sixaola had been founded by tributary groups sent by the [[Aztec]] emperor [[Moctezuma Xocoyotzin|Moctezuma II]], who were driven there during the Spanish conquest of [[Tenochtitl\u00e1n]] and decided to stay there.\n\nThe Nicoya Peninsula and gulf region were the first Costa Rican territories to definitively and lastingly submit to the dominion of the [[Crown of Castile]], around 1520. The interest in these areas was strengthened by the erroneous assumption that it would allow communication between the gulf and [[Lake Nicaragua]], and beginning in 1522 there was constant Castilian presence in the region.\n\nMuch of the knowledge we know regarding the life of this region's inhabitants is derived from the chronicles of [[Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo y Vald\u00e9s]], who visited the Nicoyan people in 1529. It is possible that many of their institutions and customs were similar to those of the [[Chorotega people|Chorotegan]] indigenous communities that at the time inhabited the Nicaraguan side of the Pacific. Details of the latter, among those regions administered by friar [[Francisco de Bobadilla]], were more numerously recorded by Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo and other conquistadors as well as a few priests.\n\nThe population of Nicoya was a political, religious and economic center, located a short distance from the modern-day city of this name. (In the middle of the 16th century, there were two other dependencies also known as Nicoya, one larger than the other.) In Nicoya would reside a high chief, who held that post for life and exercised political authority, and would carry out religious and ceremonial functions. It appears that there was prevalently a dynasty-elective system for chief succession. Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo indicated that this priest had other principal vassals and horseman called ''galpones'', who would accompany him and protect him, and be his court subjects and captains. It is possible that these elders, whom the chronicler describes as arrogant and cruel, represented the various tributary villages of Nicoya.\n\n[[Fray Juan de Torquemada]] wrote that the Chorotegan villages in the Gulf of Nicoya area organized themselves into four \"provinces\": two within the peninsula, [[Nicoya]] and Cantr\u00e9n (Canjel); and two others on the west coast, [[Oroti\u00f1a]] y [[Chorotega people|Chorotega]]. Other sources mention [[Canj\u00e9n]], [[Diri\u00e1]], [[Nacaome]], [[Namiap\u00ed]], [[Nicopasaya]], [[Papagayo]], [[Paro (Costa Rica)|Paro]] and [[Zapand\u00ed]], as well as the island of [[Pococi]] (today known as [[Isla Caballo]]).\n\n===Social organization===\n\nThe Chorotega society was hierarchical, and in the upper social strata appeared chieftains, warriors, priests and elders of prestige known as ''[[huehue]]s''. The authority of the village chieftains was not absolute, since they shared it with the ''[[mon\u00e9xico]]'', a council of ''huehues'' elected monthly and in which there were possibly representatives of various clans and communities. The members of the ''mon\u00e9xico'' were perhaps the same individuals previously mentioned as ''galpones'' \u2013 since the buildings where the council met were known by that name (surely derived from the term ''\"calpulli\"'') \u2013 that were assigned to a neighborhood, village or district among the indigenous people of Mexico. Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo wrote:\n\n{{cquote|Among the other customary things of these people, one appears just and honest to us, such as when the chieftains are to provide for their armies and warfare, or when they are to present themselves to the Christians or agree to an extraordinary expense. And it is when the chieftain and his principals enter into their ''mon\u00e9xico'' or council, and bestow fortune (after agreeing to what is to be given) to which of them is to remain in the office of provision or of distribution to all citizens, and to make them expand the way that the ''mon\u00e9xico'' was ordered. The governors and officials who are to attend with the chieftain or president in the ''mon\u00e9xico'' are elected by fours for four moons, and those completed, become like any other citizens, and others server in kind; but [the duty of office] is always done by the ''huehues'', that is, the most principal elders.}}\n\nIn some communities, the ''mon\u00e9xico'' had the legal authority to elect or bring death to the chieftain or principal ruler. On the Chorotegan community of [[Nagrando]] ([[Nicaragua]]), Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo wrote:\n\n{{cquote|It was not governed by a chieftain or sole elder, but rather in a communal manner by a certain number of elders elected by vote; and those same would affect a captain general for affairs of war, and after he with the others ruled their state when one died or was killed in a battle or confrontation, they would elect another, and sometimes those same would kill each other if one were found to be an inconvenience to the republic.}}\n\nFor his part, the chronicler [[Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara]] indicates:\n\n{{cquote|[Between the indigenous peoples of Nicaragua] there could not be a committee or council, especially in warfare, without the chieftain or captain of the republic and assumptive village. They declare war over borders or boundary markers, over hunting and who is better and more powerful. It is like this everywhere until they capture men for sacrifice. Each chief has for his people a special sign in war and even at home. The free towns elect a captain general who is the most skillful and expert they find, who rules and punishes absolutely and without appeal to the elders.}}\n\nIt is possible that in [[Nicoya]] there existed a similar system. In each case, the governor had limited authority and needed to take into account the traditions and opinions of the community. In 1529, when Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo recommended to [[Namb\u00ed]], chieftain of Nicoya, that he put an end to certain rites of collective drunkenness, he received the following response:\n\n{{cquote|... that in the case of the drunken women, he saw that it was bad; but that such was the custom and of their past, and that if it wasn't done the people would not love him well and would hold him in poor conversation, and that he would depart from them from the land.}}\n\nThe ''mon\u00e9xico'' also had the right to elect certain elders of prestige as counselors to the community. These elders, whose activities the Spaniards compared to the Christian confessional, had private consultations, made recommendations to someone who sought his help, and allotted such penances as sweeping the plazas or gathering firewood for the temples. Counselors who divulged the content of these consultations, and third parties who listened to them surreptitiously, were severely punished. These counselors, in contrast to custom among the priests, remained permanently unmarried.\n\n===Laws===\n\nIt is not clear if the ''mon\u00e9xico'' also had judicial functions. In his work ''Costa Rica, la frontera sur de Mesoam\u00e9rica'' (Costa Rica, the southern border of Mesoamerica), the lawyer and anthropologist [[Ricardo Quesada L\u00f3pez-Calleja]] indicates that the chieftain would name experienced and capable elders as judges, whose rulings could not be appealed. Quesada also notes that in the case of bigamy, the counselor would dictate the sentence.\n\nThe available data regarding the normative organization of the Chorotegan people indicate that from the point of view of Western jurisprudence, it was a system of minimal complexity based on precedence, with minor infractions and few sanctions. On the other hand, it is very possible that they had written norms. The chronicler [[Antonio de Herrera]] states that the Chorotegan peoples of [[Nicaragua]] had voluminous books of paper and parchment, where they recorded memorable facts and had their laws and rites depicted. [[Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo]] indicated that they possessed books of deerskin, where in red and black ink they recorded their deaths and inheritances. So, when there were conflicts or disputes, they could be settled with the opinion of the elders. At the beginning of the 20th century, as a result of a few archeological excavations on the island of Chira, a square book with hieroglyphics was found that was called ''el misal chorotega'' (the Chorotegan missal or prayer book); but it is unknown where this document was used. The sole reference known about this find is offered by the archeologist [[Mar\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez Le Cappellain]] de Tinoco, who visited the island of [[Chira Island|Chira]] in 1935. In her article, \"Chira, olvidada cuna de aguerridas tribus precolombina\" (Chira, forgotten cradle of war-hardened pre-Columbian tribes), she relates the account of Fern\u00e1ndez Le Cappellain of an islander who said:\n\n{{cquote|Here ... I came accompanied by Father Velazco more than twenty-five years ago, when this gentleman made his expeditions to the island. In a place very near, after five months of expedition, we discovered something very important called the Choretega missal, a square book with many hieroglyphics.}}\n\nFamily ties were very important. The organization of the Chorotegan family was fundamentally cognate or matrilineal. furthermore, according to Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo, the Chorotega men were \"very much commanded by and subject to the will of their women.\" L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara says they were \"valiant, though cruel and very subject to their women\". Marriage between blood relatives was prohibited and incest was practically unknown.\n\n====Marriage====\n\nMarriage was monogamous and appeared indissoluble, except in the case of [[adultery]] or [[bigamy]]. Some chieftains and high-ranking people had concubines, but they were never considered legitimate wives. Customarily, marriage required a series of ceremonies. It began with the asking for a woman's hand, that was executed by the father of the would-be groom during a formal visit with the woman's parents. If the request was accepted, a date was set for the wedding celebration. The marriage vow was celebrated with great fiestas, to which the families, friends and neighbors of the coupe would come. Before the wedding, both bride and bridegroom would receive a [[dowry]] from their respective parents, which may have included, in accordance with a family's economic means, arable land, a dwelling, cocoa beans, jewelry, animals, fruits, etc.\n\nLands and valuable pieces of jewelry were inherited by the couple's children. However, if one of the spouses died without the marriage bearing descendants, these wares would return to the control of the parents. The father had the authority to sell the children for sacrificial rituals.\n\nIn [[Nicoya]] and [[Oroti\u00f1a]], the chieftains exercised ''[[droit du seigneur]]'' (right of the first night) or ''ius primae noctis'' upon request from the woman's family, so that it would be easier for her to find a husband. According to L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara, some native peoples of [[Nicaragua]] preferred to give their wives-to-be \"to the chieftains who would break them, to be honored more or to rid themselves of suspicion or anxiety.\" When Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo reprimanded chieftain [[Namb\u00ed]] for continuing to have several wives and continuing to spend many nights with virgin women despite being baptized, the Nicoyan chief protested:\n\n{{cquote|... that in [the affairs] of women, he did not want more than one, if it were possible; that he would be content with one rather than many; but that his fathers gave their daughters and begged him to take them; and he would take others who looked good to him, and he would be successful by having many sons; and that of the young virgins, he took them to honor them and their relatives, and then the other Indians would be willing to marry them ...}}\n\nThe wedding ceremony was carried out in the presence of the chieftain and the families of the engaged. The chieftain, with his right hand, would take the bride and groom by the middle and little fingers of their left hands, conducted them to a small house designated for carrying out wedding rites and there said to them: \"See that you are good spouses and that you look over your estate, and that you always improve it and not let it be spoiled.\" Afterwards, the couple would observe silence as they watched a sliver of ''ocote'' (native pine) burn. When that was consumed, the ceremony would be declared complete and the new husband and wife would retire into a room in the house to consummate the marriage.\n\nWedding celebrations would start the following day, when the couple came out of the house and the husband announced before his friends and relatives that he had found the woman a virgin. This declaration would give rise to general rejoicing. In the event that the woman had been delivered to the husband-to-be as a virgin, but had already had sexual relations, she was returned to her parents' house and the wedding would be considered invalid. On the other hand, if the husband-to-be had known before the wedding that the woman was not a virgin, the marriage would be considered valid.\n\nMany men preferred to take women who were no longer virgins as spouses, and even those of licentious conduct. Also, references survive regarding a peculiar matrimonial practice of the [[Nicarao people|Nicarao]]s, that may have also existed between the Chorotegans: A woman would engage in prostitution to obtain a dowry, congregate afterwards with her clients, ask that they build her a house within a certain time period and tell them that each one had to contribute. When the dwelling was finished, the woman would choose a husband from her among her clients, a party would take place and from then on she would be considered a good woman. It should be mentioned that prostitution, even without marriage as an end, was permitted; and Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo states that the normal price for a woman's sexual services was ten cocoa beans. The chronicler L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara says that the women \"before getting married were generally bad, and once married, good.\"\n\nThe Chorotegans also celebrated rites of collective catharsis, sometimes accompanied by human sacrifice and ritual cannibalism. During these rites, married women, as the principals they were, could have sexual relations with whom they wanted or those who paid them, without later being subjected to jealously or punishment. Under normal circumstances, however, a woman's adultery was punished by admonition, severe [[corporal punishment]] and expulsion from the home. Their relatives would insult her and not recognize her, and the community would consider her an impure, shameless woman.\n\nMale [[bigamy]] was punished by loss of property and exile. His legitimate wife could remarry, if she had no children through bigamy. If there were any, she could not marry again, but if she assumed the care of the children, she would have a right to the property from the bigamous relationship. The woman who married a man with full knowledge of the relationship's bigamous nature lost all of her property in favor of the legitimate wife. Whoever raped a woman was bound to the house where the offense happened, and his own relatives would have to support him until he paid for the crime with a certain amount of property. If he did not meet this obligation, he would become a slave to her family. If a servant had sexual relations with his master's daughter, both would be buried alive. Sexual relations between males were also sentenced to death by stoning.\n\n====Economy====\n\nAs in other indigenous communities of Mesoamerica, ownership of arable land and agricultural work between Chorotegans had to be essentially of a collective nature. Quesada L\u00f3pez-Calleja indicates that land could not be sold and that parents conferred it to their children or to their relatives, if they lacked descendants, when they felt that their final hour had arrived. Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo's references to the Chorotegans' deerskin leather book imply that some type of [[cadastre]] existed, though is possible that litigation over lands was not between individuals, but groups.\n\nIndividual private property existed mainly with respect to personal property. Thieves were condemned to return stolen items to their rightful owner and to serve their victims to repay the damage, and remained bound to the victim's house until the debt was satisfied. If the victim received no compensation, the thief could remain in slavery. A similar situation could occur whenever a homicide was committed, since the criminal had to pay restitution for the wrongdoing with goods to satisfy the victim's relatives, or otherwise become their slave.\n\nThe ''tianguez'' or market played a central role in the economic life of the Chorotega towns, for which commerce and labor practices of certain complexity had to exist. These markets were tended by women, men were not permitted to enter, except for young people who had never had sexual relations. Men who violated such prohibitions could be stoned, be sold as slaves or be sold as cannibal fodder. Presiding over the markets were judge-administrators elected once every four months by the ''mon\u00e9xico'', according to Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo:\n\n{{cquote|... the first thing one does in the city councils, is determining faithful executors for another four months, who all, or at least one of them, never leaves the plaza and ''tianguez'' or market: and those faithful leaders are mayors and absolute governors within those places, to allow sellers neither force nor improper measure, nor giving of less than what was to be given or exchanged in their sales, nor fraud: and they punish without remission some of the transgressors by his decrees and customs, and to strangers they offer courtesy and welcome, because they always come more by their hiring.}}\n\nAlthough barter played an important role in trade, Chorotegans used cacao beans as currency. Cases of counterfeiting appeared, where cacao would be extracted from beans and replaced with dirt.\n\n====Crime====\n\nThe religion, language, customs and laws of the Chorotega gradually disappeared as a consequence of the Spanish conquest. diverse sources from the time of the Spanish domination praise the laws of the Nicoyans and their attitude with regard to the law. For example, in the second half of the 16th century, the [[cosmography|cosmographer]] [[Juan L\u00f3pez de Velasco]] indicated that the natives of Nicoya were \"loyal and obedient to justice\", and at the beginning of the 17th century they were still remembered as being ruled by wise laws, that among them there did not exist punishments for [[patricide]], [[matricide]] or [[regicide]], because the Nicoyans believed that no person was capable of committing such crimes. The chronicler [[L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara]] recounts that among the natives of Nicaragua, which included the Chorotega, \"there is no punishment for killing a chieftain, saying that this cannot occur. For his part, Friar Bobadilla reported that when he asked a native of Nicaragua what they did when somebody killed a chieftain, the informant responded that it never happened, \"because the chieftain does not communicate with despicable people.\"\n\n==Intermediate Area==\n{{See also|Western Huetar Kingdom|Eastern Huetar Kingdom|Garabito Empire}}\nIn the 16th century, the present-day territory of Costa Rica \u2013 with the exception of the Nicoya Peninsula, its eponymous gulf and the Nahuan enclaves \u2013 formed the cultural region known as the Intermediate Area. In addition, this included the Atlantic regions of [[Nicaragua]], Panama and [[Colombia]], as well as parts of [[Venezuela]] and the Pacific coast of [[Ecuador]]. It is possible that in earlier eras, the Nicoyan region had formed part of this area, and that its original settlers had been displaced by Mesoamerican groups arriving from the north.\n\nThe [[Intermediate Area]] of Costa Rica, upon the arrival of the Spaniards, featured much less cultural unity than the Mesoamerican Area. Numerous communities with different languages and customs lived there, though most languages spoken there belonged to the Macro-Chibcha language family. The culture of some of these groups, especially on the Atlantic side, had many elements similar to those of the Caribbean islands; but in other groups a South American influence was discernible. For example, in 1562 the town hall of the recently founded city of [[Castillo de Garcimu\u00f1oz]], located in the Central Valley, wrote to King [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] that the natives of Costa Rica imitated [[Peru]]vian dress and contracting practices. In the 17th century, some natives of Talamanca still preserved the practice of counting numbers of people on ropes with different types of knots, analogous to the use of knotted straps by the [[Inca]]n empire. Similarities can also be found between the customs of certain communities and those of [[Panama]]nian and [[Colombia]]n native peoples.\n\nThere were commercial ties, [[vassal]]ages and alliances between many of the communities in the Intermediate Area of Costa Rica, but there was no sole authority in the entire territory; rather, a multitude of societies with different levels of complexity. In Spanish documents appear mention of a great number of native groups: Aoyaque, Burica, Cab\u00e9car, Catapa, Chome, Corobic\u00ed, Coto, Guaym\u00ed, Huetar, Pococi, Quepo, Suerre, Tariaca, T\u00e9rraba, Tice, Turucaca, Urinama, Viceita, Voto. However, references in this regard are too brief and imprecise to clearly identify the various ethnic groups or their specific characteristics. The names of locations and of the chiefs are also problematic, since they sometimes use two or more names for the same place or person, or the same name for a place and a chieftain. It is even suggested that this may have been due to a custom of changing the name of a place whenever a chieftain died, conferring upon it the name of the deceased.\n\nThe Europeans took special note of the great linguistic diversity; even today, the indigenous languages that survive in Costa Rica have very different characteristics. There possibly also existed a great multiplicity of codes of conduct. However, the territory of the Intermediate Area was not visited by chroniclers such as Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo and missionaries such as Bobadilla, and the data that exists regarding these peoples' religious and judicial lives is exceptionally scant, isolated and fragmentary.\n\nIn the 16th century, it appears in the Intermediate Area that a scattered type of settlement prevailed, defined by the existence of hamlets composed of two or three very large, communal ranches, whose inhabitants cultivated the enclosed fields. Some sources indicate that in each dwelling lived \"an entire family, clan or lineage.\" Although in certain places like [[Guayabo]] there remain archeological testaments to the existence of larger settlements, there appears to have been a lesser tendency for communities to urbanize than in the Nicoyan region, perhaps because nomadic and seminomadic cultivation compelled these groups to slowly move around. In contrast to what occurred in other places in Central America, the Spaniards did not manage to find any population center large enough to qualify as a city.\n\n===Social organization===\n\nThe towns in the Intermediate Area were found to be organized in chiefdoms both large and small, and in clans of common heritage. It is known of several groups that they were subordinate to others and paid tribute to their chieftain; on the other hand, it is very problematic to clearly fix the hierarchical line, because documentation is too vague and imprecise about particular aspects, and sometimes uses imprecise terms such ''cacique mayor'' and ''cacique principal'' (major chieftain and principal chieftain). In other cases it is difficult to determine whether relations between various groups was of subordination or simple alliance. In addition to the term ''cacique'', the conquistadors use synonyms for principal chieftain such as ''taque'', meaning \"chief\" or \"he who rules\" in [[Chibcha]]; ''ibux'', which could identify brothers or sons of a chieftain, and ''uri'' meaning \"master's son\".\n\nAmong the major chiefdoms that have been identified, perhaps one of the most well-known are those of:\n\n* Chief [[King Garabito|Garabito]] (whose indigenous name was possibly ''Guar-Abito'', \"the sentry of Abito\"; the Diego de Artieda Chirinos and Ucl\u00e9s agreement <nowiki>[</nowiki>1573<nowiki>]</nowiki> speaks of the province of \"Guaravito\" instead of Garabito) in the central Pacific region and part of the western section of the Central Valley\n* Chief [[El Guarco]], whose successor [[Correque]] ruled over a territory that extended from the [[R\u00edo Virilla]] to [[Aserr\u00ed]] and eastward to [[Chirrip\u00f3]] and [[Parragua]]\n\nBoth appear to have had an important number of communities and groups under their control. Other chieftains, however, did not have subordinate ties with them.\n\nAlthough there are indications that certain communities had patrilineal dynastic systems similar to those of the [[Inca]]s, most chiefdoms in Costa Rica were lifelong and of matrilineal heredity as in other parts of the Intermediate Area. In some communities this system must have been dynastic-elective; it was still this way, for example, in certain indigenous groups of [[Talamanca people|Talamanca]] in the second half of the 19th century, according to American paleontologist [[William More Gabb]]:\n\n{{cquote|The form of government is extremely simple. A family has hererditary right to the chieftainship.... The succession is not practiced in a direct line; rather, upon the death of the chief, the most eligible member of the royal family is elected to fill the vacancy. Often, instead of the son, the selection would fall upon some second cousin of the last chief.... It has been customary that the heir apparent, the future successor, was second in position or vice-chieftain, with little or no authority.}}\n\nIt is known that in some villages a woman could be the chieftain: In 1562, a Spanish captain who visited the Voto community was \"well received by an Indian chieftainess of theirs and by her husband who ruled little among them.\"\n\nThe Costa Rican chieftains in the Intermediate Area had greater powers than those of [[Kingdom of Nicoya|Nicoya]]; for example, when Correque moved his residence from [[Ujarr\u00e1s]] to [[Tucurrique]], he brought with him many elders and gentlemen along with their sons, \"because the place he wanted was settled and nobody contradicted him.\" Garabito also appears to have enjoyed considerable authority. However, perhaps in other groups the power of the main chieftain over others was not absolute, but was rather exercised in concert with subordinate chieftains. In some communities, the effective authority of the chieftains must've been lesser still, as for example the writings of Gabb in the latter half of the 19th suggest regarding the natives of [[Talamanca (canton)|Talamanca]]:\n\n{{cquote|In ancient times the chiefs exercised no more than a nominal power over the town. The principal advantages they derive from their position were more of a social than political character. The chief would be brought to the best seat in the house upon entering any home. He would be treated with great luxury and would be offered chocolate, while people of lower class would have to content themselves with ''chicha'' (maize liquor). But (in) case of war, the chief would have to defend himself against beatings from long and heavy clubs, as any other ordinary mortal.}}\n\nIn most communities, the chieftain played roles of vital importance. He would channel productive activities, redistribute surpluses, solve internal conflicts and impart justice, manage relationships with other groups and perform functions akin to a priest. His person was almost always sacred; he would carry special clothing and insignias, and would be surrounded by attendants and servants, as in an elaborate protocol. The principal achievements of his life and his funerals were usually characterized by complex, solemn public rites. The social hierarchy depended in many ways on the chieftain's family relations, since a person's rank was determined by how far or close in blood relationship he was to the chieftain.\n\nWarriors and priests typically belong to the upper classes, and also had special clothes and insignias. In some towns, such as those of the Coctus and Cotos, there were female warriors known as ''[[biriteca]]s''. The [[Coctu]] ''biritecas'' captured Dulcehe, the sister of the [[Quepo]] chieftain [[Corrohore]], who was freed through the intervention of the conquistador [[Juan V\u00e1zquez de Coronado]]. As a proper name or nickname, \"Biriteca\" has been freely given to the first lady of the famous chieftain [[King Garabito|Garabito]], as well as the aforementioned Dulcehe, who was later baptized as Do\u00f1a In\u00e9s. Garabito's biographer, Oscar B\u00e1kit, points out how absurd these idenfiers were, saying: \"Dulcehe was never nicknamed ''La Biriteca'', as such a name would have been an insult to her, since it belonged to the very same women whom she had taken prisoner.\"<ref>{{citation|author=[[Oscar B\u00e1kit]]|title=Garavito, nuestra ra\u00edz perdida (Garavito, our lost roots)|year=1981|id=}}</ref>\n\nMilitary confrontations between the groups were frequent, and prisoners of war were sent to ritual sacrifice, even without the habitual cannibalism in Mesoamerican ceremonies. The missionary friar [[Agust\u00edn de Cevallos]], when he refers to the many indigenous groups in southwestern Costa Rica in 1610, states that they lived in constant war with each other, because they had to periodically sacrifice some people, \"and when they have none, without sacrificing any from their nation, attack those of another [village] and those that they capture are sacrificed; and if they have any left, they sell them to other neighbors for the same.\" The slaves would also be sacrificed for burial with chieftains or other members of the upper class.{{Citation needed|reason=No reference|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Laws===\n\n====Marriage====\n\nThe norms on family and kinship were based on a cognatic system, for which the relationship between a nephew and his maternal uncle was important. The family organization was based on matrilineal clans that were supposed descendants of a common ancestor and that sometimes identified themselves as a group with a common name \u2013 for example, one taken from an animal. In certain indigenous groups of what are today the Talamanca, sexual relations between people of the same cognatic group were rigorously prohibited, which imposed requirements of [[exogamy]]: the men had to look for a wife in another clan. Violators of this rule were buried alive. An matrilocal system of residence prevailed; in other words, a man had to go away to live in the house of his parents-in-law. As a fianc\u00e9 or husband, he had to work to contribute to the communal sustenance of his new family; thus young women were considered \"as advantageous property to their families.\" If the husband ever be became ill, he would have to return to his parents' house; but if the sickness was caused by sores or lasted too long, or if the man were an idler, the woman would no longer readmit him. They did not recognize kinship through an agnatic line (i.e., via the father) and consequently sexual dealings were irrelevant between two people related by exclusively patrilineal bonds.\n\nIn the Intermediate Area the prevalent system of marriage seems to have been syndiasmic, although it is not impossible that in some communities there had been monogamous forms of marriage. Polygamy, as among the Nicoyans, was reserved for chiefs and others in the upper social strata. A document from 1763 indicates:\n\n{{cquote|[between the natives of [[Talamanca (canton)|Talamanca]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> the men did not get married unless they were at least twenty years of age, but the women, if they were good-looking, were usually married at six or seven years of age; so the women would raise them and care for them as daughters in their company until such time as they became useful. The Indians of respect, had by the rich and by valiant gentlemen among others, had a plurality of women, that commonly were their sisters-in-law, which they would elevate to nobility.}}\n\nHowever, in the latter half of the 19th century, many men among the natives of Talamanca would have two or sometimes three wives, and the husband had his choice of a plurality of women.\n\nThe word used today in the [[Bribri]] language of Talamanca to define marriage, which literally means \"united hands,\" symbolizes how simple the ceremony could be, if there was any. A German missionary stated at even at the start of the 20th century, there remained between these same Bribris a type of marriage with barely any formalities, but in which the mother of the bride played an important role:\n\n{{cquote|The suitor is presented at his fianc\u00e9e's home.... \"I have come to spend the night,\" he says. \"I come for a very important matter.\" In this way the groom begins. Then the cacao is prepared, shared and drunk plentily. If some neighbor visits, the mother of the bride invites him to stay.... Finally, the mother asks the suitor at an opportune moment what the important matter is, calling him aside. If it is convenient to the mother, she looks for a special large serving gourd that she has stored in her farmhouse, fills it with cacao and delivers it to her daughter so that she can offer it to her fianc\u00e9, which he must drink by itself. The following day the groom-to-be returns to his house and the mother of the bride barely talks to her husband about the matter, which very rarely changes their decision. The mother again advises the suitor to come to her house.... The marriage is no longer discussed, as it is considered done.}}\n\nAs with other matrimonial systems, in the Intermediate Area of Costa Rica the wife may have had a position in the family equal or even superior to that of the husband, as demonstrated in the case of the chieftainess of the Votos. She possibly also enjoyed greater sexual freedom that the Chorotegan woman, since groups of the Intermediate Area do not appear to have given importants to virginity and there were women who deliver themselves to those who solicited them. At the end of the 19th century, [[William More Gabb]] stated that between the natives of [[Talamanca (canton)|Talamanca]], \"when puberty arrives, it is the sign that they should get married, at least on the part of the young women.... I am certain that very few kept their virginity until marriage.\"\n\nAs is customary in sindiasmic families, there does not seem to have been a substantial difference between the positions of the male and female in regards to the dissolution of the marriage, as suggested by the customs that the native groups of Talamanca maintained at the end of the 19th century: \"No formula is required to enter into marriage and it lasts for however long it is convenient to the husband and wife. In the case of infidelity on the part of the wife, or of undue cruelty on the part of the husband, they can be separated. Sometimes, if the woman becomes unfaithful, the husband whips her severely and perhaps returns her to her family, or the resentful woman abandons him. This separation last for one or two years, or may be definitive; but during that time, either of the parties can enter into new bonds and then the separation is permanent.\"\n\nThere are also indications that sexual relationships and living arrangements between men were permitted. With respect to a group from the Intermediate Area in Panama (which was strongly linked to the Costa Rican portion) Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo write that homosexuals \"are not rejected nor mistreated for it. Such men are not joined with other men without a license to what they have, and if they do, they are killed.\"\n\n====Economy====\n\nIn the Costa Rican Intermediate Area there must have prevailed collective systems of work and ownership of arable land, though there were positions of privilege for people belong to the upper social strata. No documentational reference has been found regarding the existence of markets, although the accumulation of artifacts in places such as [[L\u00ednea Vieja]] allow one to suppose that in some places there was very intense commerce. In certain settlements the existence has been confirmed of plazas that could have been utilized for redistribution of goods, as well as for religious rites.\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of Costa Rica]]\n*[[Models of migration to the New World]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pre-Columbian History Of Costa Rica}}\n[[Category:History of Costa Rica]]\n[[Category:Cannibalism in North America]]\n[[Category:Pre-Columbian era]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use American English|date = February 2019}}\n{{Short description|Costa Rica before Spanish colonization}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}\n{{Refimprove|date=December 2008}}\n\nThe '''pre-Columbian history of [[Costa Rica]]''' extends from the establishment of the first settlers until the arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] to the Americas.\n\nArchaeological evidence allows us to date the arrival of the first humans to Costa Rica to between 7000 and 10,000 BC. By the second millennium BC sedentary farming communities already existed. Between 300 BC and AD 300 many communities moved from a tribal, clan-centric organization \u2013 kinship-based, rarely hierarchical and dependent on self-sustenance \u2013 to a hierarchical one, with ''[[cacique]]s'' (chiefs), religious leaders or shamans, artisan specialists and so on. This social organization arose from the need to organize manufacture and trade, manage relations with other communities and plan offensive and defensive activities. These groups established broader territorial divisions to produce more food and control wider sources of raw materials.\n\nFrom the 9th century certain villages grew in size, and the latter-period chiefdoms of the 16th century came to develop greater social hierarchies and major improvements in infrastructure.\n\n==Ancient history==\n\n===First settlers===\n\nThe presence of humans in the Americas was a much later phenomenon than on other continents. The first humans are barely dated to around 40,000 to 50,000 BC, and it is suggested a later date. In any case, the concentration of ice over the continents during the last [[last glacial period|Ice Age]] caused the oceans to recede by about 120 meters (400&nbsp;feet), allowing groups of hunters from northeast Asia to move eastward in pursuit of great herds of animals. They traveled to North America and settled there in several waves, and over the course of several millennia and through successive generations, the descendants of these hunters spread out throughout the Americas and her neighboring islands.\n\nThere is archaeological evidence that places the arrival of the first humans to Costa Rica between [[7th millennium BC|7,000]] and [[10th millennium BC|10,000]] BC. In the valley of [[Turrialba Volcano|Turrialba]] sites have been found in areas where quarry and tradesman tools such as [[biface]]s were manufactured. It is thought that these first settlers of Costa Rica belonged to small nomadic groups of around 20 to 30 members bound by kinship, which moved continually to hunt animals and gather roots and wild plants. In addition to the species that still exist today, their usual prey animals included the so-called mega-fauna such as giant [[Giant Armadillo|armadillos]], [[ground sloth|sloths]] and [[mastodon]]s.\n\n===Mesolithic Period===\n\nAround 8000 BC climatic changes brought about the end of the last [[last glacial period|Ice Age]]. The increase in temperature caused substantial changes in vegetation and saw the extinction of the mega-fauna, through either the disappearance of the plants they consumed, excessive predation by hunter or a combination of both. The [[hunter-gatherer]]s had to develop strategies to adapt to new conditions, and they continued by hunting smaller species such as [[tapir]]s, [[collared peccary]] and [[deer]]. The new wealth of tropical vegetation, moreover, helped them to survive through all times of year.\n\nIt is thought that human groups remained small, about 30 to 100 members, organized in nomadic or semi-nomadic bands devoted to hunting and gathering. However, the knowledge of the local environment allowed them to plan their travels though different areas based on the periodic ripening of certain fruits and the growth of familiar plants (that would later form the basis of agriculture) as well as the availability of other resources. Along these familiar paths they could find temporary shelter under rock ledges, or establish outdoor camps with ''tapavientos'' (windbreaker walls based on the [[podocarpus guatemalensis|cipresillo]] tree) or other temporary structures.\n\nTradesman work areas, campfire pits and other fragmentary evidence of life in these groups have been found in the [[Turrialba Volcano|Turrialba]] valley and in various spots around [[Guanacaste Province|Guanacaste]]. The manufacturing of specialized tools for various activities continued, and artifacts from this era such as scrapers, knives and spear tips display differences in form and size relative to those of the mega-fauna hunters.\n\n===Neolithic Period===\n\nBy 5000 BC it became common to farm [[tuber]]s and [[maize|corn]], as well as cultivate fruit trees and palm trees. Agriculture emerged slowly, stemming from knowledge of the annual cycles of nature and the progressive domestication of familiar plants. This development occurred over thousands of years and coexisted with traditional hunting and gathering, but it afforded a certain amount of stability. To ensure subsistence of these groups there had to exist forms of collective work and property, as well as [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] relationships.\n\nBetween 2000 BC and 300 BC, some communities of early farmers became egalitarian societies. The development of agriculture prompted changes in the relationship between humans and nature, and allowed them to feed many more people. Furthermore, the ever-growing dependence on agriculture compelled human groups to establish permanent settlements around agricultural fields. This led to stable villages of huts that had to be erected in clear areas of the forest. The agricultural system most likely employed was slash-and-burn: The forest would be cut with stone axes and spades then burned to prepare it for planting crops. Agricultural practices included vegeculture, semiculture or a combination of both.\n\n[[Vegeculture]] (cultivation of plants on stakes) came about by farming tubers ([[cassava|yucas]], [[yam (vegetable)|yam]]s, [[sweet potato]]es) and diverse palms and trees ([[avocado]]s, [[nance]]s), in combination with hunting and fishing. This activity was very stable, since it demanded few nutrients from the soil, rarely caused erosion and could be developed in hilly areas. By such means, societies based on vegeculture would change very slowly.\n\nIn contrast to vegeculture, [[semiculture]] (cultivation of plants from seeds) had a greater effect on the environment, because it required more nutrients from the soil and caused greater erosion. In return, this system had a big advantage: it make food easier to store so that it could be made available all year, not just around harvest time. This led to larger societies where functions would be diversified. The primary semicultural activity was the production of corn, as well as associated plants such as beans and ''ayotes'' (a type of gourd related to the pumpkin).\n\nThroughout the [[2nd millennium BC]] there existed in Costa Rica small, disperse villages, non-nomadic agricultural communities that used ceramic bowls and utensils, and tools made from wood, bone and stone for agricultural tasks and food preparation. The oldest of these agricultural village communities (2000\u2013500 BC) has been found in the province of [[Guanacaste Province|Guanacaste]]. More recent ones (1500\u2013300 BC) have been discovered in the [[Turrialba Volcano|Turrialba]] Valley, the coastal region of [[Gandoca]], the northern plains, [[Sarapiqu\u00ed (canton)|Sarapiqu\u00ed]] Basin, [[Barva (canton)|Barva]], [[Playa Herradura, Costa Rica|Herradura]], the [[T\u00e9rraba River]] Basin, the [[Coto Colorado River]] Basin and [[Isla del Ca\u00f1o]].\n\n==Societal evolution==\n{{multiple image|perrow=1/1/1/1|total_width=300|caption_align=center\n| image1 = Stone sphere.jpg|caption1=Stone sphere made by the Diquis culture.\n| image2 = Pre-Columbian incense burner, Costa Rica (Carlos Museum).jpg|caption2=A Pre-Columbian incense burner with a crocodile lid.\n| image3 = Ceramicas Nicoya.jpg|caption3=Pre-Columbian Ceramics from Nicoya, Costa Rica.\n| image4 = Diquis Human Effigy Pendant.jpg|caption4=A Diquis human effigy pendant.\n}}\n===Egalitarian societies===\n\nIn the beginning, the social organization of these groups would've been of a tribal or clan-based nature, with [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] relationships between individuals and organizations, in clans or groups whose members were or would consider themselves to be descended from a common ancestry. Such ties would have served as a foundation for economic and political relations; the leadership would've been informal and ownership of goods would've been collective. However, agriculture, sendentarism and a broadening demographic would've prompted the formation of higher classes of society, and the advent of leaders who built organizations well-suited to manage food production and distribution, calm disputes and so on. Important figures such as the [[shamanism|shaman]] (a kind of priest), physician and witch doctor would have overseen religious and spiritual life.\n\n===Early chiefdoms===\nWith dependency on agriculture came the need for efficient territorial control, to ensure the availability of suitable farmlands and improvement of productive techniques. Soil depletion and the consequent necessity to rotate crops, as well as a steady increase in the population, also made it essential to expand a group's sphere of territorial dominance. Almost inevitably, this brought about the rise of armed conflict with other groups.\n\nBetween 300 BC and 300 AD, many villager-egalitarian communities in Costa Rica moved from a tribal, clan-centric organization \u2013 kinship-based, rarely hierarchical and dependent on self-sustenance \u2013 to a villager-chief organization, with chiefs and elders, religious leaders or shamans, specialist artisans, people of hereditary power and so on. These chiefdoms likely arose from the need to organize production and trade, manage relations with other communities and plan offensive and defensive initiatives.\n\nThese [[chiefdom]] groups in general established territorial divisions that were more strongly demarcated than those in tribal times, and were able to expand their geographical spheres of domination to produce more food and control expanding sources of raw materials (forests, quarries, etc.). These groups also developed trading networks with other communities and regions.\n\nOther villages grew and became centers of economic, political and religious power. Some studies refer to these new forms of organization as complex chiefdoms. The appearance of these types of chiefdoms also led to higher-level hierarchies, with principal villages and secondary towns. From around 300 BC there began to appear large villages with intrastructural works of various importance (foundations, roads and burial mounds), that indicate a certain centralization of authority and managerial capacity to mobilize communities for construction tasks. There might emerge a primary chief in the dominant village and as well as secondary chiefs in subordinate villages. Among the principal archeological testaments to this era, it is fitting to mention diverse housing sites in the [[Nicoya Peninsula]], housing structures at the sites of Severo Ledesma and Las Mercedes \u2013 and on the Atlantic side, other settlement ruins in Valle del General, as well as the [[Coto Brus]], [[Coto Colorado River|Coto Colorado]] and [[T\u00e9rraba River]] basin.\n\nSeveral archeological sites in [[Guanacaste Province]] are linked to this period, particularly tombs covered in tons of stone. Similar funeral mounds have appeared in the canton of [[Grecia (canton)|Grecia]]. In other places in the [[Costa Rican Central Valley]] and along the Pacific, archeologists have uncovered housing plots delimited with rounded edges, mounds, clay floors and roads. In the south Pacific region are the famous [[stone spheres of Costa Rica]], whose purpose is still a mystery, though it is suggested that they may have been symbols of rank or territorial markers, or had an astronomical function associated with cycles of agriculture.\n\nThere was a great development in the manufacture of objects made of [[jadeite]] or so-called \"social\" [[Costa Rican jade tradition|jade]] (green or off-white stones such as [[quartz]], [[chalcedony]], [[opal]], [[serpentine group|serpentine]], etc.). It is supposed that they were used as personal ornaments then later on in individual burial clothes, since most have been found at burial sites. Deep local tradition in [[jade]]-work (which began around 500 BC and continued until around AD 700 for the most part developed without external influence, although some pieces display features of [[Olmec]] and [[Maya civilization|Maya]]n artisanship. Their motifs apparently had religious meaning. Burials from this period demonstrate the existence of rank and class, since burial offerings include artifacts made of jade and other green gemstones, ceremonial grinding stones, sceptre stones and elaborate ceramics. The number, quality and difficulty of obtaining these articles are a means of indicating the person's social rank.\n\nWith the advances in agriculture and corresponding social changes, the most successful communities established social hierarchies based on economic and political criteria. Between AD 300 and 800, these chiefdom societies developmented internal social strata, with political and religious leaders, warriors, specialized artisans and farmers. The ruling class could fill functions such as distributors for communally produced goods, military leaders, crisis counselors and so on. In any case, they usually had access to goods that were especially valuable because they were difficult to obtain or manufacture; and they were distinguished from other natives by their prominent living quarters within the villages, as well as the more elaborate funeral rites and offerings their status afforded.\n\n===Later chiefdoms===\n\nFrom the 9th century certain villages grew in size and their internal design became more complex, giving rise to the era of late pre-Columbian chiefdoms which lasted until the 16th century. It is possible that more fruitful varieties of corn and other crops, as well as more perfected agricultural methods coincided with an increase in population, a deeper social hierarchy and stronger relationships between communities further down the social chain. In some villages the ''[[cacique]]s'' or shamans promoted the infrastructure improvements that required the mobilization of immense work forces. There was a notable peak in the art of goldsmithing throughout the country. In addition there was an increase in the variety of domestic and personal goods, regional trade, alliances and territorial conflicts.\n\nAt the start of this period, Mesoamerican cultural groups began to trickle over the [[Nicoya Peninsula]], principally the [[Chorotega people]], who subordinated, displaced or mixed with populations that had previously settled in the Nicoyan territory. These new peoples introduced changes in religion, burial rites, art and other aspects of life; as well as new domesticated animals such as [[domestic turkey|turkey]]s. This period corresponds to habitation sites located in coastal valleys such as [[Nacascolo de Liberia|Nacascolo]] and [[Gulf of Papagayo|Papagayo]]; and the flood plains of the [[Tempisque River]] and other important rivers. In addition there were other places that specialized in the salt extraction, providing a precious trading commodity, especially for groups that lived inland. Skill in multi-colored [[ceramic art]] reached an advanced level; new colors and styles became available to local ceramic artisans, clearly inspired by Mesoamericana.\n\nIn the heart of Costa Rica populations became more concentrated in organized economic and political centers, that would form living and ceremonial groups.  The most well-known archeological site of this kind is [[Guayabo]] in Turrialba, which contains raised mounds with walls of stone, access ramps and pedestals, as well as aqueducts, elevated platforms, circular and rectangular foundations, paved walkways and other structures. But others have been found in widespread places in the Central Valle, the Caribbean region and the northern plains. In this era there was a great development in stonework with volcanic rocks, to make tables, stone tablets, grinding stones and anthropomorphic figures (women, heads, shamans, warriors and so forth).\n\nIn the south Pacific region have also been found great quantities of home foundations, roads, dump sites, plus funeral areas and mounds. These settlements were located in very fertile regions, bringing about the extensive cultivation of corn and cotton, and the use of palm trees (''[[scheelea butyracea|coyoles]]'' and [[roystonea|royal palms]]) and fruit trees (''[[Hymenaea courbaril|guapinoles]]'', [[nance]]s, etc.). This was the height of sphere-making, as well as of stone artisanship in such works as animal figures, grindstones, grand anthropomorphic statues (which appear to represent important social figures) that featured smooth surfaces. There was and increase in goldsmithing with ''guan\u00edn'' (low-grade gold) and ''[[tumbaga]]'' (gold and copper alloy) using hammering and thin-sheet techniques. Mineral deposits themselves were not exploited, as gold was extracted from rivers and copper from outcrops.\n\n==Societal classification==\n\nWhen the Europeans arrived, [[Costa Rica]] was not a unified land but was inhabited by diverse peoples independent from each other, and whose respective cultures had many different levels of complexity and development. The traditional view that divides this territory between the [[Chorotega people|Chorotegas]], [[Huetar people|Huetars]] and [[Boruca people|Bruncas]] has been abandoned, since these names in fact only identified a small part of the nations that existed in Costa Rican proper at the time. In light of recent studies, it has become much more appropriate to identify two major principal areas:\n\n* The ''[[Intermediate Area]]'' (or ''[[Isthmo-Colombian Area]]''), with [[Caribbean]] and South American influences\n* The ''[[Mesoamerican|Mesoamerican Area]]'', a great cultural expanse that extends from [[Chiapas]] and the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]] in present-day Mexico to the [[Nicoya Peninsula]] as well as its eponymous gulf\n\nThere is no strict boundary, either cultural or political, between the Intermediate and Mesoamerican Areas, because there would've been frequent contact and transcultural exchange between both groups of people, over all the confluent areas. Even so, notable culture differences existed between them. Some peoples in the Mesoamerican Area, for example, were organized into societies that appear more complex than those of their contemporaries in the Intermediate Area, having legal institutions which, from a Western point of view, may have been more developed. On the other hand, in both regions it appears the prevalent system of law was exclusively or almost exclusively [[consuetudinary]], based on custom rather than the rule of law. It is possible, however, that the [[Kingdom of Nicoya|indigenous Nicoyans]] preserved their legal codes by means of some writing system similar to those of other Mesoamerican cultures.\n\nPart of what we know about these societies is from reports and letters written by the Spanish [[conquistador]]s and missionaries, people whose training and mentality were borne of cultural norms very different from those of the indigenous societies, and whose view of them at times was distorted through prejudice, personal interest or mere ignorance. Such documents are not very numerous, and on occasion are superficial, fragmentary or very general; and talk about a very small number of the indigenous groups that existed.\n\n==Mesoamerican Area==\n\nIn the opening decades of the 16th century, most of the people inhabiting the Nicoya Peninsula and the vicinity of its eponymous gulf belonged to the Mesoamerican cultural area. Their presence has also been attested in the central Pacific region between the [[Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda River|Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda]] and [[T\u00e1rcoles River|T\u00e1rcoles]] Rivers. These people spoke [[Chorotega language|Chorotega]], and this is why sometimes they are generically designated as such. Furthermore, in the vicinity of modern-day [[Bagaces (canton)|Bagaces]], at the mouth of the [[San Juan River (Nicaragua)|San Juan River]] and the [[Sixaola River]] basin there were enclaves of groups with Mexican cultural roots who spoke [[N\u00e1huatl]]. According to several documents from the second half of the 16th century, the [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] colony in Sixaola had been founded by tributary groups sent by the [[Aztec]] emperor [[Moctezuma Xocoyotzin|Moctezuma II]], who were driven there during the Spanish conquest of [[Tenochtitl\u00e1n]] and decided to stay there.\n\nThe Nicoya Peninsula and gulf region were the first Costa Rican territories to definitively and lastingly submit to the dominion of the [[Crown of Castile]], around 1520. The interest in these areas was strengthened by the erroneous assumption that it would allow communication between the gulf and [[Lake Nicaragua]], and beginning in 1522 there was constant Castilian presence in the region.\n\nMuch of the knowledge we know regarding the life of this region's inhabitants is derived from the chronicles of [[Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo y Vald\u00e9s]], who visited the Nicoyan people in 1529. It is possible that many of their institutions and customs were similar to those of the [[Chorotega people|Chorotegan]] indigenous communities that at the time inhabited the Nicaraguan side of the Pacific. Details of the latter, among those regions administered by friar [[Francisco de Bobadilla]], were more numerously recorded by Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo and other conquistadors as well as a few priests.\n\nThe population of Nicoya was a political, religious and economic center, located a short distance from the modern-day city of this name. (In the middle of the 16th century, there were two other dependencies also known as Nicoya, one larger than the other.) In Nicoya would reside a high chief, who held that post for life and exercised political authority, and would carry out religious and ceremonial functions. It appears that there was prevalently a dynasty-elective system for chief succession. Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo indicated that this priest had other principal vassals and horseman called ''galpones'', who would accompany him and protect him, and be his court subjects and captains. It is possible that these elders, whom the chronicler describes as arrogant and cruel, represented the various tributary villages of Nicoya.\n\n[[Fray Juan de Torquemada]] wrote that the Chorotegan villages in the Gulf of Nicoya area organized themselves into four \"provinces\": two within the peninsula, [[Nicoya]] and Cantr\u00e9n (Canjel); and two others on the west coast, [[Oroti\u00f1a]] y [[Chorotega people|Chorotega]]. Other sources mention [[Canj\u00e9n]], [[Diri\u00e1]], [[Nacaome]], [[Namiap\u00ed]], [[Nicopasaya]], [[Papagayo]], [[Paro (Costa Rica)|Paro]] and [[Zapand\u00ed]], as well as the island of [[Pococi]] (today known as [[Isla Caballo]]).\n\n===Social organization===\n\nThe Chorotega society was hierarchical, and in the upper social strata appeared chieftains, warriors, priests and elders of prestige known as ''[[huehue]]s''. The authority of the village chieftains was not absolute, since they shared it with the ''[[mon\u00e9xico]]'', a council of ''huehues'' elected monthly and in which there were possibly representatives of various clans and communities. The members of the ''mon\u00e9xico'' were perhaps the same individuals previously mentioned as ''galpones'' \u2013 since the buildings where the council met were known by that name (surely derived from the term ''\"calpulli\"'') \u2013 that were assigned to a neighborhood, village or district among the indigenous people of Mexico. Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo wrote:\n\n{{cquote|Among the other customary things of these people, one appears just and honest to us, such as when the chieftains are to provide for their armies and warfare, or when they are to present themselves to the Christians or agree to an extraordinary expense. And it is when the chieftain and his principals enter into their ''mon\u00e9xico'' or council, and bestow fortune (after agreeing to what is to be given) to which of them is to remain in the office of provision or of distribution to all citizens, and to make them expand the way that the ''mon\u00e9xico'' was ordered. The governors and officials who are to attend with the chieftain or president in the ''mon\u00e9xico'' are elected by fours for four moons, and those completed, become like any other citizens, and others server in kind; but [the duty of office] is always done by the ''huehues'', that is, the most principal elders.}}\n\nIn some communities, the ''mon\u00e9xico'' had the legal authority to elect or bring death to the chieftain or principal ruler. On the Chorotegan community of [[Nagrando]] ([[Nicaragua]]), Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo wrote:\n\n{{cquote|It was not governed by a chieftain or sole elder, but rather in a communal manner by a certain number of elders elected by vote; and those same would affect a captain general for affairs of war, and after he with the others ruled their state when one died or was killed in a battle or confrontation, they would elect another, and sometimes those same would kill each other if one were found to be an inconvenience to the republic.}}\n\nFor his part, the chronicler [[Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara]] indicates:\n\n{{cquote|[Between the indigenous peoples of Nicaragua] there could not be a committee or council, especially in warfare, without the chieftain or captain of the republic and assumptive village. They declare war over borders or boundary markers, over hunting and who is better and more powerful. It is like this everywhere until they capture men for sacrifice. Each chief has for his people a special sign in war and even at home. The free towns elect a captain general who is the most skillful and expert they find, who rules and punishes absolutely and without appeal to the elders.}}\n\nIt is possible that in [[Nicoya]] there existed a similar system. In each case, the governor had limited authority and needed to take into account the traditions and opinions of the community. In 1529, when Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo recommended to [[Namb\u00ed]], chieftain of Nicoya, that he put an end to certain rites of collective drunkenness, he received the following response:\n\n{{cquote|... that in the case of the drunken women, he saw that it was bad; but that such was the custom and of their past, and that if it wasn't done the people would not love him well and would hold him in poor conversation, and that he would depart from them from the land.}}\n\nThe ''mon\u00e9xico'' also had the right to elect certain elders of prestige as counselors to the community. These elders, whose activities the Spaniards compared to the Christian confessional, had private consultations, made recommendations to someone who sought his help, and allotted such penances as sweeping the plazas or gathering firewood for the temples. Counselors who divulged the content of these consultations, and third parties who listened to them surreptitiously, were severely punished. These counselors, in contrast to custom among the priests, remained permanently unmarried.\n\n===Laws===\n\nIt is not clear if the ''mon\u00e9xico'' also had judicial functions. In his work ''Costa Rica, la frontera sur de Mesoam\u00e9rica'' (Costa Rica, the southern border of Mesoamerica), the lawyer and anthropologist [[Ricardo Quesada L\u00f3pez-Calleja]] indicates that the chieftain would name experienced and capable elders as judges, whose rulings could not be appealed. Quesada also notes that in the case of bigamy, the counselor would dictate the sentence.\n\nThe available data regarding the normative organization of the Chorotegan people indicate that from the point of view of Western jurisprudence, it was a system of minimal complexity based on precedence, with minor infractions and few sanctions. On the other hand, it is very possible that they had written norms. The chronicler [[Antonio de Herrera]] states that the Chorotegan peoples of [[Nicaragua]] had voluminous books of paper and parchment, where they recorded memorable facts and had their laws and rites depicted. [[Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo]] indicated that they possessed books of deerskin, where in red and black ink they recorded their deaths and inheritances. So, when there were conflicts or disputes, they could be settled with the opinion of the elders. At the beginning of the 20th century, as a result of a few archeological excavations on the island of Chira, a square book with hieroglyphics was found that was called ''el misal chorotega'' (the Chorotegan missal or prayer book); but it is unknown where this document was used. The sole reference known about this find is offered by the archeologist [[Mar\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez Le Cappellain]] de Tinoco, who visited the island of [[Chira Island|Chira]] in 1935. In her article, \"Chira, olvidada cuna de aguerridas tribus precolombina\" (Chira, forgotten cradle of war-hardened pre-Columbian tribes), she relates the account of Fern\u00e1ndez Le Cappellain of an islander who said:\n\n{{cquote|Here ... I came accompanied by Father Velazco more than twenty-five years ago, when this gentleman made his expeditions to the island. In a place very near, after five months of expedition, we discovered something very important called the Choretega missal, a square book with many hieroglyphics.}}\n\nFamily ties were very important. The organization of the Chorotegan family was fundamentally cognate or matrilineal. furthermore, according to Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo, the Chorotega men were \"very much commanded by and subject to the will of their women.\" L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara says they were \"valiant, though cruel and very subject to their women\". Marriage between blood relatives was prohibited and incest was practically unknown.\n\n====Marriage====\n\nMarriage was monogamous and appeared indissoluble, except in the case of [[adultery]] or [[bigamy]]. Some chieftains and high-ranking people had concubines, but they were never considered legitimate wives. Customarily, marriage required a series of ceremonies. It began with the asking for a woman's hand, that was executed by the father of the would-be groom during a formal visit with the woman's parents. If the request was accepted, a date was set for the wedding celebration. The marriage vow was celebrated with great fiestas, to which the families, friends and neighbors of the coupe would come. Before the wedding, both bride and bridegroom would receive a [[dowry]] from their respective parents, which may have included, in accordance with a family's economic means, arable land, a dwelling, cocoa beans, jewelry, animals, fruits, etc.\n\nLands and valuable pieces of jewelry were inherited by the couple's children. However, if one of the spouses died without the marriage bearing descendants, these wares would return to the control of the parents. The father had the authority to sell the children for sacrificial rituals.\n\nIn [[Nicoya]] and [[Oroti\u00f1a]], the chieftains exercised ''[[droit du seigneur]]'' (right of the first night) or ''ius primae noctis'' upon request from the woman's family, so that it would be easier for her to find a husband. According to L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara, some native peoples of [[Nicaragua]] preferred to give their wives-to-be \"to the chieftains who would break them, to be honored more or to rid themselves of suspicion or anxiety.\" When Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo reprimanded chieftain [[Namb\u00ed]] for continuing to have several wives and continuing to spend many nights with virgin women despite being baptized, the Nicoyan chief protested:\n\n{{cquote|... that in [the affairs] of women, he did not want more than one, if it were possible; that he would be content with one rather than many; but that his fathers gave their daughters and begged him to take them; and he would take others who looked good to him, and he would be successful by having many sons; and that of the young virgins, he took them to honor them and their relatives, and then the other Indians would be willing to marry them ...}}\n\nThe wedding ceremony was carried out in the presence of the chieftain and the families of the engaged. The chieftain, with his right hand, would take the bride and groom by the middle and little fingers of their left hands, conducted them to a small house designated for carrying out wedding rites and there said to them: \"See that you are good spouses and that you look over your estate, and that you always improve it and not let it be spoiled.\" Afterwards, the couple would observe silence as they watched a sliver of ''ocote'' (native pine) burn. When that was consumed, the ceremony would be declared complete and the new husband and wife would retire into a room in the house to consummate the marriage.\n\nWedding celebrations would start the following day, when the couple came out of the house and the husband announced before his friends and relatives that he had found the woman a virgin. This declaration would give rise to general rejoicing. In the event that the woman had been delivered to the husband-to-be as a virgin, but had already had sexual relations, she was returned to her parents' house and the wedding would be considered invalid. On the other hand, if the husband-to-be had known before the wedding that the woman was not a virgin, the marriage would be considered valid.\n\nMany men preferred to take women who were no longer virgins as spouses, and even those of licentious conduct. Also, references survive regarding a peculiar matrimonial practice of the [[Nicarao people|Nicarao]]s, that may have also existed between the Chorotegans: A woman would engage in prostitution to obtain a dowry, congregate afterwards with her clients, ask that they build her a house within a certain time period and tell them that each one had to contribute. When the dwelling was finished, the woman would choose a husband from her among her clients, a party would take place and from then on she would be considered a good woman. It should be mentioned that prostitution, even without marriage as an end, was permitted; and Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo states that the normal price for a woman's sexual services was ten cocoa beans. The chronicler L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara says that the women \"before getting married were generally bad, and once married, good.\"\n\nThe Chorotegans also celebrated rites of collective catharsis, sometimes accompanied by human sacrifice and ritual cannibalism. During these rites, married women, as the principals they were, could have sexual relations with whom they wanted or those who paid them, without later being subjected to jealously or punishment. Under normal circumstances, however, a woman's adultery was punished by admonition, severe [[corporal punishment]] and expulsion from the home. Their relatives would insult her and not recognize her, and the community would consider her an impure, shameless woman.\n\nMale [[bigamy]] was punished by loss of property and exile. His legitimate wife could remarry, if she had no children through bigamy. If there were any, she could not marry again, but if she assumed the care of the children, she would have a right to the property from the bigamous relationship. The woman who married a man with full knowledge of the relationship's bigamous nature lost all of her property in favor of the legitimate wife. Whoever raped a woman was bound to the house where the offense happened, and his own relatives would have to support him until he paid for the crime with a certain amount of property. If he did not meet this obligation, he would become a slave to her family. If a servant had sexual relations with his master's daughter, both would be buried alive. Sexual relations between males were also sentenced to death by stoning.\n\n====Economy====\n\nAs in other indigenous communities of Mesoamerica, ownership of arable land and agricultural work between Chorotegans had to be essentially of a collective nature. Quesada L\u00f3pez-Calleja indicates that land could not be sold and that parents conferred it to their children or to their relatives, if they lacked descendants, when they felt that their final hour had arrived. Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo's references to the Chorotegans' deerskin leather book imply that some type of [[cadastre]] existed, though is possible that litigation over lands was not between individuals, but groups.\n\nIndividual private property existed mainly with respect to personal property. Thieves were condemned to return stolen items to their rightful owner and to serve their victims to repay the damage, and remained bound to the victim's house until the debt was satisfied. If the victim received no compensation, the thief could remain in slavery. A similar situation could occur whenever a homicide was committed, since the criminal had to pay restitution for the wrongdoing with goods to satisfy the victim's relatives, or otherwise become their slave.\n\nThe ''tianguez'' or market played a central role in the economic life of the Chorotega towns, for which commerce and labor practices of certain complexity had to exist. These markets were tended by women, men were not permitted to enter, except for young people who had never had sexual relations. Men who violated such prohibitions could be stoned, be sold as slaves or be sold as cannibal fodder. Presiding over the markets were judge-administrators elected once every four months by the ''mon\u00e9xico'', according to Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo:\n\n{{cquote|... the first thing one does in the city councils, is determining faithful executors for another four months, who all, or at least one of them, never leaves the plaza and ''tianguez'' or market: and those faithful leaders are mayors and absolute governors within those places, to allow sellers neither force nor improper measure, nor giving of less than what was to be given or exchanged in their sales, nor fraud: and they punish without remission some of the transgressors by his decrees and customs, and to strangers they offer courtesy and welcome, because they always come more by their hiring.}}\n\nAlthough barter played an important role in trade, Chorotegans used cacao beans as currency. Cases of counterfeiting appeared, where cacao would be extracted from beans and replaced with dirt.\n\n====Crime====\n\nThe religion, language, customs and laws of the Chorotega gradually disappeared as a consequence of the Spanish conquest. diverse sources from the time of the Spanish domination praise the laws of the Nicoyans and their attitude with regard to the law. For example, in the second half of the 16th century, the [[cosmography|cosmographer]] [[Juan L\u00f3pez de Velasco]] indicated that the natives of Nicoya were \"loyal and obedient to justice\", and at the beginning of the 17th century they were still remembered as being ruled by wise laws, that among them there did not exist punishments for [[patricide]], [[matricide]] or [[regicide]], because the Nicoyans believed that no person was capable of committing such crimes. The chronicler [[L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara]] recounts that among the natives of Nicaragua, which included the Chorotega, \"there is no punishment for killing a chieftain, saying that this cannot occur. For his part, Friar Bobadilla reported that when he asked a native of Nicaragua what they did when somebody killed a chieftain, the informant responded that it never happened, \"because the chieftain does not communicate with despicable people.\"\n\n==Intermediate Area==\n{{See also|Western Huetar Kingdom|Eastern Huetar Kingdom|Garabito Empire}}\nIn the 16th century, the present-day territory of Costa Rica \u2013 with the exception of the Nicoya Peninsula, its eponymous gulf and the Nahuan enclaves \u2013 formed the cultural region known as the Intermediate Area. In addition, this included the Atlantic regions of [[Nicaragua]], Panama and [[Colombia]], as well as parts of [[Venezuela]] and the Pacific coast of [[Ecuador]]. It is possible that in earlier eras, the Nicoyan region had formed part of this area, and that its original settlers had been displaced by Mesoamerican groups arriving from the north.\n\nThe [[Intermediate Area]] of Costa Rica, upon the arrival of the Spaniards, featured much less cultural unity than the Mesoamerican Area. Numerous communities with different languages and customs lived there, though most languages spoken there belonged to the Macro-Chibcha language family. The culture of some of these groups, especially on the Atlantic side, had many elements similar to those of the Caribbean islands; but in other groups a South American influence was discernible. For example, in 1562 the town hall of the recently founded city of [[Castillo de Garcimu\u00f1oz]], located in the Central Valley, wrote to King [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] that the natives of Costa Rica imitated [[Peru]]vian dress and contracting practices. In the 17th century, some natives of Talamanca still preserved the practice of counting numbers of people on ropes with different types of knots, analogous to the use of knotted straps by the [[Inca]]n empire. Similarities can also be found between the customs of certain communities and those of [[Panama]]nian and [[Colombia]]n native peoples.\n\nThere were commercial ties, [[vassal]]ages and alliances between many of the communities in the Intermediate Area of Costa Rica, but there was no sole authority in the entire territory; rather, a multitude of societies with different levels of complexity. In Spanish documents appear mention of a great number of native groups: Aoyaque, Burica, Cab\u00e9car, Catapa, Chome, Corobic\u00ed, Coto, Guaym\u00ed, Huetar, Pococi, Quepo, Suerre, Tariaca, T\u00e9rraba, Tice, Turucaca, Urinama, Viceita, Voto. However, references in this regard are too brief and imprecise to clearly identify the various ethnic groups or their specific characteristics. The names of locations and of the chiefs are also problematic, since they sometimes use two or more names for the same place or person, or the same name for a place and a chieftain. It is even suggested that this may have been due to a custom of changing the name of a place whenever a chieftain died, conferring upon it the name of the deceased.\n\nThe Europeans took special note of the great linguistic diversity; even today, the indigenous languages that survive in Costa Rica have very different characteristics. There possibly also existed a great multiplicity of codes of conduct. However, the territory of the Intermediate Area was not visited by chroniclers such as Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo and missionaries such as Bobadilla, and the data that exists regarding these peoples' religious and judicial lives is exceptionally scant, isolated and fragmentary.\n\nIn the 16th century, it appears in the Intermediate Area that a scattered type of settlement prevailed, defined by the existence of hamlets composed of two or three very large, communal ranches, whose inhabitants cultivated the enclosed fields. Some sources indicate that in each dwelling lived \"an entire family, clan or lineage.\" Although in certain places like [[Guayabo]] there remain archeological testaments to the existence of larger settlements, there appears to have been a lesser tendency for communities to urbanize than in the Nicoyan region, perhaps because nomadic and seminomadic cultivation compelled these groups to slowly move around. In contrast to what occurred in other places in Central America, the Spaniards did not manage to find any population center large enough to qualify as a city.\n\n===Social organization===\n\nThe towns in the Intermediate Area were found to be organized in chiefdoms both large and small, and in clans of common heritage. It is known of several groups that they were subordinate to others and paid tribute to their chieftain; on the other hand, it is very problematic to clearly fix the hierarchical line, because documentation is too vague and imprecise about particular aspects, and sometimes uses imprecise terms such ''cacique mayor'' and ''cacique principal'' (major chieftain and principal chieftain). In other cases it is difficult to determine whether relations between various groups was of subordination or simple alliance. In addition to the term ''cacique'', the conquistadors use synonyms for principal chieftain such as ''taque'', meaning \"chief\" or \"he who rules\" in [[Chibcha]]; ''ibux'', which could identify brothers or sons of a chieftain, and ''uri'' meaning \"master's son\".\n\nAmong the major chiefdoms that have been identified, perhaps one of the most well-known are those of:\n\n* Chief [[King Garabito|Garabito]] (whose indigenous name was possibly ''Guar-Abito'', \"the sentry of Abito\"; the Diego de Artieda Chirinos and Ucl\u00e9s agreement <nowiki>[</nowiki>1573<nowiki>]</nowiki> speaks of the province of \"Guaravito\" instead of Garabito) in the central Pacific region and part of the western section of the Central Valley\n* Chief [[El Guarco]], whose successor [[Correque]] ruled over a territory that extended from the [[R\u00edo Virilla]] to [[Aserr\u00ed]] and eastward to [[Chirrip\u00f3]] and [[Parragua]]\n\nBoth appear to have had an important number of communities and groups under their control. Other chieftains, however, did not have subordinate ties with them.\n\nAlthough there are indications that certain communities had patrilineal dynastic systems similar to those of the [[Inca]]s, most chiefdoms in Costa Rica were lifelong and of matrilineal heredity as in other parts of the Intermediate Area. In some communities this system must have been dynastic-elective; it was still this way, for example, in certain indigenous groups of [[Talamanca people|Talamanca]] in the second half of the 19th century, according to American paleontologist [[William More Gabb]]:\n\n{{cquote|The form of government is extremely simple. A family has hererditary right to the chieftainship.... The succession is not practiced in a direct line; rather, upon the death of the chief, the most eligible member of the royal family is elected to fill the vacancy. Often, instead of the son, the selection would fall upon some second cousin of the last chief.... It has been customary that the heir apparent, the future successor, was second in position or vice-chieftain, with little or no authority.}}\n\nIt is known that in some villages a woman could be the chieftain: In 1562, a Spanish captain who visited the Voto community was \"well received by an Indian chieftainess of theirs and by her husband who ruled little among them.\"\n\nThe Costa Rican chieftains in the Intermediate Area had greater powers than those of [[Kingdom of Nicoya|Nicoya]]; for example, when Correque moved his residence from [[Ujarr\u00e1s]] to [[Tucurrique]], he brought with him many elders and gentlemen along with their sons, \"because the place he wanted was settled and nobody contradicted him.\" Garabito also appears to have enjoyed considerable authority. However, perhaps in other groups the power of the main chieftain over others was not absolute, but was rather exercised in concert with subordinate chieftains. In some communities, the effective authority of the chieftains must've been lesser still, as for example the writings of Gabb in the latter half of the 19th suggest regarding the natives of [[Talamanca (canton)|Talamanca]]:\n\n{{cquote|In ancient times the chiefs exercised no more than a nominal power over the town. The principal advantages they derive from their position were more of a social than political character. The chief would be brought to the best seat in the house upon entering any home. He would be treated with great luxury and would be offered chocolate, while people of lower class would have to content themselves with ''chicha'' (maize liquor). But (in) case of war, the chief would have to defend himself against beatings from long and heavy clubs, as any other ordinary mortal.}}\n\nIn most communities, the chieftain played roles of vital importance. He would channel productive activities, redistribute surpluses, solve internal conflicts and impart justice, manage relationships with other groups and perform functions akin to a priest. His person was almost always sacred; he would carry special clothing and insignias, and would be surrounded by attendants and servants, as in an elaborate protocol. The principal achievements of his life and his funerals were usually characterized by complex, solemn public rites. The social hierarchy depended in many ways on the chieftain's family relations, since a person's rank was determined by how far or close in blood relationship he was to the chieftain.\n\nWarriors and priests typically belong to the upper classes, and also had special clothes and insignias. In some towns, such as those of the Coctus and Cotos, there were female warriors known as ''[[biriteca]]s''. The [[Coctu]] ''biritecas'' captured Dulcehe, the sister of the [[Quepo]] chieftain [[Corrohore]], who was freed through the intervention of the conquistador [[Juan V\u00e1zquez de Coronado]]. As a proper name or nickname, \"Biriteca\" has been freely given to the first lady of the famous chieftain [[King Garabito|Garabito]], as well as the aforementioned Dulcehe, who was later baptized as Do\u00f1a In\u00e9s. Garabito's biographer, Oscar B\u00e1kit, points out how absurd these idenfiers were, saying: \"Dulcehe was never nicknamed ''La Biriteca'', as such a name would have been an insult to her, since it belonged to the very same women whom she had taken prisoner.\"<ref>{{citation|author=[[Oscar B\u00e1kit]]|title=Garavito, nuestra ra\u00edz perdida (Garavito, our lost roots)|year=1981|id=}}</ref>\n\nMilitary confrontations between the groups were frequent, and prisoners of war were sent to ritual sacrifice, even without the habitual cannibalism in Mesoamerican ceremonies. The missionary friar [[Agust\u00edn de Cevallos]], when he refers to the many indigenous groups in southwestern Costa Rica in 1610, states that they lived in constant war with each other, because they had to periodically sacrifice some people, \"and when they have none, without sacrificing any from their nation, attack those of another [village] and those that they capture are sacrificed; and if they have any left, they sell them to other neighbors for the same.\" The slaves would also be sacrificed for burial with chieftains or other members of the upper class.{{Citation needed|reason=No reference|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Laws===\n\n====Marriage====\n\nThe norms on family and kinship were based on a cognatic system, for which the relationship between a nephew and his maternal uncle was important. The family organization was based on matrilineal clans that were supposed descendants of a common ancestor and that sometimes identified themselves as a group with a common name \u2013 for example, one taken from an animal. In certain indigenous groups of what are today the Talamanca, sexual relations between people of the same cognatic group were rigorously prohibited, which imposed requirements of [[exogamy]]: the men had to look for a wife in another clan. Violators of this rule were buried alive. An matrilocal system of residence prevailed; in other words, a man had to go away to live in the house of his parents-in-law. As a fianc\u00e9 or husband, he had to work to contribute to the communal sustenance of his new family; thus young women were considered \"as advantageous property to their families.\" If the husband ever be became ill, he would have to return to his parents' house; but if the sickness was caused by sores or lasted too long, or if the man were an idler, the woman would no longer readmit him. They did not recognize kinship through an agnatic line (i.e., via the father) and consequently sexual dealings were irrelevant between two people related by exclusively patrilineal bonds.\n\nIn the Intermediate Area the prevalent system of marriage seems to have been syndiasmic, although it is not impossible that in some communities there had been monogamous forms of marriage. Polygamy, as among the Nicoyans, was reserved for chiefs and others in the upper social strata. A document from 1763 indicates:\n\n{{cquote|[between the natives of [[Talamanca (canton)|Talamanca]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> the men did not get married unless they were at least twenty years of age, but the women, if they were good-looking, were usually married at six or seven years of age; so the women would raise them and care for them as daughters in their company until such time as they became useful. The Indians of respect, had by the rich and by valiant gentlemen among others, had a plurality of women, that commonly were their sisters-in-law, which they would elevate to nobility.}}\n\nHowever, in the latter half of the 19th century, many men among the natives of Talamanca would have two or sometimes three wives, and the husband had his choice of a plurality of women.\n\nThe word used today in the [[Bribri]] language of Talamanca to define marriage, which literally means \"united hands,\" symbolizes how simple the ceremony could be, if there was any. A German missionary stated at even at the start of the 20th century, there remained between these same Bribris a type of marriage with barely any formalities, but in which the mother of the bride played an important role:\n\n{{cquote|The suitor is presented at his fianc\u00e9e's home.... \"I have come to spend the night,\" he says. \"I come for a very important matter.\" In this way the groom begins. Then the cacao is prepared, shared and drunk plentily. If some neighbor visits, the mother of the bride invites him to stay.... Finally, the mother asks the suitor at an opportune moment what the important matter is, calling him aside. If it is convenient to the mother, she looks for a special large serving gourd that she has stored in her farmhouse, fills it with cacao and delivers it to her daughter so that she can offer it to her fianc\u00e9, which he must drink by itself. The following day the groom-to-be returns to his house and the mother of the bride barely talks to her husband about the matter, which very rarely changes their decision. The mother again advises the suitor to come to her house.... The marriage is no longer discussed, as it is considered done.}}\n\nAs with other matrimonial systems, in the Intermediate Area of Costa Rica the wife may have had a position in the family equal or even superior to that of the husband, as demonstrated in the case of the chieftainess of the Votos. She possibly also enjoyed greater sexual freedom that the Chorotegan woman, since groups of the Intermediate Area do not appear to have given importants to virginity and there were women who deliver themselves to those who solicited them. At the end of the 19th century, [[William More Gabb]] stated that between the natives of [[Talamanca (canton)|Talamanca]], \"when puberty arrives, it is the sign that they should get married, at least on the part of the young women.... I am certain that very few kept their virginity until marriage.\"\n\nAs is customary in sindiasmic families, there does not seem to have been a substantial difference between the positions of the male and female in regards to the dissolution of the marriage, as suggested by the customs that the native groups of Talamanca maintained at the end of the 19th century: \"No formula is required to enter into marriage and it lasts for however long it is convenient to the husband and wife. In the case of infidelity on the part of the wife, or of undue cruelty on the part of the husband, they can be separated. Sometimes, if the woman becomes unfaithful, the husband whips her severely and perhaps returns her to her family, or the resentful woman abandons him. This separation last for one or two years, or may be definitive; but during that time, either of the parties can enter into new bonds and then the separation is permanent.\"\n\nThere are also indications that sexual relationships and living arrangements between men were permitted. With respect to a group from the Intermediate Area in Panama (which was strongly linked to the Costa Rican portion) Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo write that homosexuals \"are not rejected nor mistreated for it. Such men are not joined with other men without a license to what they have, and if they do, they are killed.\"\n\n====Economy====\n\nIn the Costa Rican Intermediate Area there must have prevailed collective systems of work and ownership of arable land, though there were positions of privilege for people belong to the upper social strata. No documentational reference has been found regarding the existence of markets, although the accumulation of artifacts in places such as [[L\u00ednea Vieja]] allow one to suppose that in some places there was very intense commerce. In certain settlements the existence has been confirmed of plazas that could have been utilized for redistribution of goods, as well as for religious rites.\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of Costa Rica]]\n*[[Models of migration to the New World]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pre-Columbian History Of Costa Rica}}\n[[Category:History of Costa Rica]]\n[[Category:Cannibalism in North America]]\n[[Category:Pre-Columbian era]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo: though\u2192through", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Columbian_history_of_Costa_Rica"}
