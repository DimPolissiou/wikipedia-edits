Two descriptions\nof the virus published on Nature this week indicated that the genome sequences from\npatients were 96% or 89% identical to the Bat CoV ZC45 coronavirus originally found in\nRhinolophus affinis 1,2. It was critical to study where the pathogen came from and how it\npassed onto human.\nAn article published on The Lancet reported that 41 people in Wuhan were found to\nhave the acute respiratory syndrome and 27 of them had contact with Huanan Seafood\nMarket 3. The 2019-nCoV was found in 33 out of 585 samples collected in the market after\nthe outbreak. The market was suspicious to be the origin of the epidemic, and was shut\ndown according to the rule of quarantine the source during an epidemic.\nThe bats carrying CoV ZC45 were originally found in Yunnan or Zhejiang province,\nboth of which were more than 900 kilometers away from the seafood market. Bats were\nnormally found to live in caves and trees. But the seafood market is in a densely-populated\ndistrict of Wuhan, a metropolitan of ~15 million people. The probability was very low for the\nbats to fly to the market. According to municipal reports and the testimonies of 31 residents\nand 28 visitors, the bat was never a food source in the city, and no bat was traded in the\nmarket. There was possible natural recombination or intermediate host of the coronavirus,\nyet little proof has been reported.\nWas there any other possible pathway? We screened the area around the seafood\nmarket and identified two laboratories conducting research on bat coronavirus. Within ~280\nmeters from the market, there was the Wuhan Center for Disease Control & Prevention\n(WHCDC) (Figure 1, from Baidu and Google maps). WHCDC hosted animals in laboratories\nfor research purpose, one of which was specialized in pathogens collection and identification 4-\n6. In one of their studies, 155 bats including Rhinolophus affinis were captured in Hubei\nprovince, and other 450 bats were captured in Zhejiang province 4. The expert in collection\nwas noted in the Author Contributions (JHT). Moreover, he was broadcasted for collecting\nviruses on nation-wide newspapers and websites in 2017 and 2019 7,8. He described that\nhe was once by attacked by bats and the blood of a bat shot on his skin. He knew the\nextreme danger of the infection so he quarantined himself for 14 days 7. In another accident,\nhe quarantined himself again because bats peed on him. He was once thrilled for capturing\na bat carrying a live tick 8.\nSurgery was performed on the caged animals and the tissue samples were collected for\nDNA and RNA extraction and sequencing 4, 5. The tissue samples and contaminated trashes\nwere source of pathogens. They were only ~280 meters from the seafood market. The\nWHCDC was also adjacent to the Union Hospital (Figure 1, bottom) where the first group\nof doctors were infected during this epidemic. It is plausible that the virus leaked around\nand some of them contaminated the initial patients in this epidemic, though solid proofs\nare needed in future study.\nThe second laboratory was ~12 kilometers from the seafood market and belonged to\nWuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences 1, 9, 10. This laboratory\nreported that the Chinese horseshoe bats were natural reservoirs for the severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) which caused the 2002-3 pandemic 9.\nThe principle investigator participated in a project which generated a chimeric virus using\nthe SARS-CoV reverse genetics system, and reported the potential for human\nemergence 10. A direct speculation was that SARS-CoV or its derivative might leak from\nthe laboratory.\nIn summary, somebody was entangled with the evolution of 2019-nCoV coronavirus.\nIn addition to origins of natural recombination and intermediate host, the killer coronavirus\nprobably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan. Safety level may need to be reinforced in\nhigh risk biohazardous laboratories. Regulations may be taken to relocate these\nlaboratories far away from city center and other densely populated places.\nContributors\nBX designed the comment and performed literature search.

The evolution of 2019-nCoV remains elusive. We found 4 insertions in the spike glycoprotein (S) which are unique to the 2019-nCoV and are not present in other coronaviruses. Importantly, amino acid residues in all the 4 inserts have identity or similarity to those in the HIV-1 gp120 or HIV-1 Gag. Interestingly, despite the inserts being discontinuous on the primary amino acid sequence, 3D-modelling of the 2019-nCoV suggests that they converge to constitute the receptor binding site. The finding of 4 unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV, all of which have identity /similarity to amino acid residues in key structural proteins of HIV-1 is unlikely to be fortuitous in nature. This work provides yet unknown insights on 2019-nCoV and sheds light on the evolution and pathogenicity of this virus with important implications for diagnosis of this virus.\nIntroduction\nCoronaviruses (CoV) are single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses that infect animals and humans. These are classified into 4 genera based on their host specificity: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus (Snijder et al., 2006). There are seven known types of CoVs that includes 229E and NL63 (Genus Alphacoronavirus), OC43, HKU1, MERS and SARS (Genus Betacoronavirus). While 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 commonly infect humans, the SARS and MERS outbreak in 2002 and 2012 respectively occurred when the virus crossed-over from animals to humans causing significant mortality (J. Chan et al., n.d.; J. F. W. Chan et al., 2015). In December 2019, another outbreak of coronavirus was reported from Wuhan, China that also transmitted from animals to humans. This new virus has been temporarily termed as 2019-novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO) (J. F.-W. Chan et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). While there are several hypotheses about the origin of 2019-nCoV, the source of this ongoing outbreak remains elusive.\nThe transmission patterns of 2019-nCoV is similar to patterns of transmission documented in the previous outbreaks including by bodily or aerosol contact with persons infected with the virus.\nIt is made available under a CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.\npreprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\nbioRxiv preprint first posted online Jan. 31, 2020; doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.30.927871. The copyright holder for this\nCases of mild to severe illness, and death from the infection have been reported from Wuhan. This outbreak has spread rapidly distant nations including France, Australia and USA among others. The number of cases within and outside China are increasing steeply. Our current understanding is limited to the virus genome sequences and modest epidemiological and clinical data. Comprehensive analysis of the available 2019- nCoV sequences may provide important clues that may help advance our current understanding to manage the ongoing outbreak.\nThe spike glycoprotein (S) of cornonavirus is cleaved into two subunits (S1 and S2). The S1 subunit helps in receptor binding and the S2 subunit facilitates membrane fusion (Bosch et al., 2003; Li, 2016). The spike glycoproteins of coronoviruses are important determinants of tissue tropism and host range. In addition the spike glycoproteins are critical targets for vaccine development (Du et al., 2013). For this reason, the spike proteins represent the most extensively studied among coronaviruses. We therefore sought to investigate the spike glycoprotein of the 2019-nCoV to understand its evolution, novel features sequence and structural features using computational tools.\nMethodology\nRetrieval and alignment of nucleic acid and protein sequences\nWe retrieved all the available coronavirus sequences (n=55) from NCBI viral genome database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and we used the GISAID (Elbe & Buckland-Merrett, 2017)[https://www.gisaid.org/] to retrieve all available full-length sequences (n=28) of 2019-nCoV as on 27 Jan 2020. Multiple sequence alignment of all coronavirus genomes was performed by using MUSCLE software (Edgar, 2004) based on neighbour joining method. Out of 55 coronavirus genome 32 representative genomes of all category were used for phylogenetic tree development using MEGAX software (Kumar et al., 2018). The closest relative was found to be SARS CoV. The glycoprotein region of SARS CoV and 2019-nCoV were aligned and visualized using Multalin software (Corpet, 1988). The identified amino acid and nucleotide sequence were aligned with whole viral genome database using BLASTp and BLASTn. The conservation of the nucleotide and amino acid motifs in 28 clinical variants of 2019-nCoV genome were presented by performing multiple sequence alignment using MEGAX software. The three dimensional structure of 2019-nCoV glycoprotein was generated by using SWISS-MODEL online server (Biasini et al., 2014) and the structure was marked and visualized by using PyMol (DeLano, 2002).\nResults\nUncanny similarity of novel inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag\nOur phylogentic tree of full-length coronaviruses suggests that 2019-nCoV is closely related to SARS CoV [Fig1]. In addition, other recent studies have linked the 2019-nCoV to SARS CoV. We therefore compared the spike glycoprotein sequences of the 2019-nCoV to that of the SARS CoV (NCBI Accession number: AY390556.1). On careful examination of the sequence alignment we found that the 2019- nCoV spike glycoprotein contains 4 insertions [Fig.2]. To further investigate if these inserts are present in any other corona virus, we performed a multiple\nIt is made available under a CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.\npreprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\nbioRxiv preprint first posted online Jan. 31, 2020; doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.30.927871. The copyright holder for this\nsequence alignment of the spike glycoprotein amino acid sequences of all available coronaviruses (n=55) [refer Table S.File1] in NCBI refseq (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) this includes one sequence of 2019-nCoV[Fig.S1]. We found that these 4 insertions [inserts 1, 2, 3 and 4] are unique to 2019-nCoV and are not present in other coronaviruses analyzed. Another group from China had documented three insertions comparing fewer spike glycoprotein sequences of coronaviruses . Another group from China had documented three insertions comparing fewer spike glycoprotein sequences of coronaviruses (Zhou et al., 2020).\nFigure 1: Maximum likelihood genealogy show the evolution of 2019- nCoV: The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method and JTT matrix-based model.

Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA X.\nFigure 2: Multiple sequence alignment between spike proteins of 2019-nCoV and SARS. The sequences of spike proteins of 2019-nCoV (Wuhan-HU-1, Accession NC_045512) and of SARS CoV (GZ02, Accession AY390556) were aligned using MultiAlin software. The sites of difference are highlighted in boxes.\nWe then analyzed all available full-length sequences (n=28) of 2019-nCoV in GISAID (Elbe & Buckland-Merrett, 2017) as on January 27, 2020 for the presence of these inserts. As most of these sequences are not annotated, we compared the nucleotide sequences of the spike glycoprotein of all available 2019-nCoV sequences using BLASTp. Interestingly, all the 4 insertions were absolutely (100%) conserved in all the available 2019- nCoV sequences analyzed [Fig.S2, Fig.S3].\nIt is made available under a CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.\npreprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\nbioRxiv preprint first posted online Jan. 31, 2020; doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.30.927871. The copyright holder for this\nWe then translated the aligned genome and found that these inserts are present in all Wuhan 2019-nCoV viruses except the 2019-nCoV virus of Bat as a host [Fig.S4]. Intrigued by the 4 highly conserved inserts unique to 2019-nCoV we wanted to understand their origin. For this purpose, we used the 2019-nCoV local alignment with each insert as query against all virus genomes and considered hits with 100% sequence coverage. Surprisingly, each of the four inserts aligned with short segments of the Human immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) proteins. The amino acid positions of the inserts in 2019-nCoV and the corresponding residues in HIV-1 gp120 and HIV-1 Gag are shown in Table 1. The first 3 inserts (insert 1,2 and 3) aligned to short segments of amino acid residues in HIV-1 gp120. The insert 4 aligned to HIV-1 Gag. The insert 1 (6 amino acid residues) and insert 2 (6 amino acid residues) in the spike glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV are 100% identical to the residues mapped to HIV-1 gp120. The insert 3 (12 amino acid residues) in 2019- nCoV maps to HIV-1 gp120 with gaps [see Table 1]. The insert 4 (8 amino acid residues) maps to HIV-1 Gag with gaps.\nAlthough, the 4 inserts represent discontiguous short stretches of amino acids in spike glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV, the fact that all three of them share amino acid identity or similarity with HIV-1 gp120 and HIV-1 Gag (among all annotated virus proteins) suggests that this is not a random fortuitous finding. In other words, one may sporadically expect a fortuitous match for a stretch of 6-12 contiguous amino acid residues in an unrelated protein. However, it is unlikely that all 4 inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein fortuitously match with 2 key structural proteins of an unrelated virus (HIV-1).\nThe amino acid residues of inserts 1, 2 and 3 of 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein that mapped to HIV-1 were a part of the V4, V5 and V1 domains respectively in gp120 [Table 1]. Since the 2019-nCoV inserts mapped to variable regions of HIV-1, they were not ubiquitous in HIV-1 gp120, but were limited to selected sequences of HIV-1 [ refer S.File1] primarily from Asia and Africa.\nThe HIV-1 Gag protein enables interaction of virus with negatively charged host surface (Murakami, 2008) and a high positive charge on the Gag protein is a key feature for the host-virus interaction. On analyzing the pI values for each of the 4 inserts in 2019-nCoV and the corresponding stretches of amino acid residues from HIV-1 proteins we found that a) the pI values were very similar for each pair analyzed b) most of these pI values were 10\u00b12 [Refer Table 1] . Of note, despite the gaps in inserts 3 and 4 the pI values were comparable. This uniformity in the pI values for all the 4 inserts merits further investigation.\nAs none of these 4 inserts are present in any other coronavirus, the genomic region encoding these inserts represent ideal candidates for designing primers that can distinguish 2019-nCoV from other coronaviruses.

The comparison of the modelled structure reveals that although inserts 1,2 and 3 are at non-contiguous locations in the protein primary sequence, they fold to constitute the part of glycoprotein binding site that recognizes the host receptor (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016) (Figure 4). The insert 1 corresponds to the NTD (N-terminal domain) and the inserts 2 and 3 correspond to the CTD (C-terminal domain) of the S1 subunit in the 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein. The insert 4 is at the junction of the SD1 (sub domain 1) and SD2 (sub domain 2) of the S1 subunit (Ou et al., 2017). We speculate, that these insertions provide additional flexibility to the glycoprotein binding site by forming a hydrophilic loop in the protein structure that may facilitate or enhance virus-host interactions.

The inserts from HIV envelop protein are shown with colored beads, present at the binding site of the protein.\nEvolutionary Analysis of 2019-nCoV\nIt has been speculated that 2019-nCoV is a variant of Coronavirus derived from an animal source which got transmitted to humans. Considering the change of specificity for host, we decided to study the sequences of spike glycoprotein (S protein) of the virus. S proteins are surface proteins that help the virus in host recognition and attachment. Thus, a change in these proteins can be reflected as a change of host specificity of the virus. To know the alterations in S protein gene of 2019-nCoV and its consequences in structural re-arrangements we performed in-sillico analysis of 2019-nCoV with respect to all other viruses. A multiple sequence alignment between the S protein amino acid sequences of 2019-nCoV, Bat-SARS-Like, SARS-GZ02 and MERS revealed that S protein has evolved with closest significant diversity from the SARS-GZ02 (Figure 1).\nInsertions in Spike protein region of 2019-nCoV\nSince the S protein of 2019-nCoV shares closest ancestry with SARS GZ02, the sequence coding for spike proteins of these two viruses were compared using MultiAlin software. We found four new insertions in the protein of 2019-nCoV- \u201cGTNGTKR\u201d (IS1), \u201cHKNNKS\u201d (IS2), \u201cGDSSSG\u201d (IS3) and \u201cQTNSPRRA\u201d (IS4) (Figure 2). To our surprise, these sequence insertions were not only absent in S protein of SARS but were also not observed in any other member of the Coronaviridae family (Supplementary figure). This is startling as it is quite unlikely for a virus to have acquired such unique insertions naturally in a short duration of time.

To know the source of these insertions in 2019-nCoV a local alignment was done with BLASTp using these insertions as query with all virus genome. Unexpectedly, all the insertions got aligned with Human immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1). Further analysis revealed that aligned sequences of HIV-1 with 2019-nCoV were derived from surface glycoprotein gp120 (amino acid sequence positions: 404-409, 462-467, 136-150) and from Gag protein (366-384 amino acid) (Table 1). Gag protein of HIV is involved in host membrane binding, packaging of the virus and for the formation of virus-like particles. Gp120 plays crucial role in recognizing the host cell by binding to the primary receptor CD4.This binding induces structural rearrangements in GP120, creating a high affinity binding site for a chemokine co-receptor like CXCR4 and/or CCR5.\nDiscussion\nThe current outbreak of 2019-nCoV warrants a thorough investigation and understanding of its ability to infect human beings. Keeping in mind that there has been a clear change in the preference of host from previous coronaviruses to this virus, we studied the change in spike protein between 2019-nCoV and other viruses. We found four new insertions in the S protein of 2019-nCoV when compared to its nearest relative, SARS CoV. The genome sequence from the recent 28 clinical isolates showed that the sequence coding for these insertions are conserved amongst all these isolates. This indicates that these insertions have been preferably acquired by the 2019-nCoV, providing it with additional survival and infectivity advantage. Delving deeper we found that these insertions were similar to HIV-1. Our results highlight an astonishing relation between the gp120 and Gag protein of HIV, with 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein. These proteins are critical for the viruses to identify and latch on to their host cells and for viral assembly (Beniac et al., 2006). Since surface proteins are responsible for host tropism, changes in these proteins imply a change in host specificity of the virus. According to reports from China, there has been a gain of host specificity in case 2019-nCoV as the virus was originally known to infect animals and not humans but after the mutations, it has gained tropism to humans as well.\nMoving ahead, 3D modelling of the protein structure displayed that these insertions are present at the binding site of 2019-nCoV. Due to the presence of gp120 motifs in 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein at its binding domain, we propose that these motif insertions could have provided an enhanced affinity towards host cell receptors. Further, this structural change might have also increased the range of host cells that 2019-nCoV can infect. To the best of our knowledge, the function of these motifs is still not clear in HIV and need to be explored. The exchange of genetic material among the viruses is well known and such critical exchange highlights the risk and the need to investigate the relations between seemingly unrelated virus families.\nConclusions\nOur analysis of the spike glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV revealed several interesting findings: First, we identified 4 unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein that are not present in any other coronavirus reported till date. To our surprise, all the 4 inserts in the 2019-nCoV mapped to It is made available under a CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.\npreprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\nbioRxiv preprint first posted online Jan. 31, 2020; doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.30.927871.

This uncanny similarity of novel inserts in the 2019- nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag is unlikely to be fortuitous. Further, 3D modelling suggests that atleast 3 of the unique inserts which are non-contiguous in the primary protein sequence of the 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein converge to constitute the key components of the receptor binding site. Of note, all the 4 inserts have pI values of around 10 that may facilitate virus-host interactions. Taken together, our findings suggest unconventional evolution of 2019-nCoV that warrants further investigation. Our work highlights novel evolutionary aspects of the 2019-nCoV and has implications on the pathogenesis and diagnosis of this virus.\nReferences\nBeniac, D.

Two descriptions\nof the virus published on Nature this week indicated that the genome sequences from\npatients were 96% or 89% identical to the Bat CoV ZC45 coronavirus originally found in\nRhinolophus affinis 1,2. It was critical to study where the pathogen came from and how it\npassed onto human.\nAn article published on The Lancet reported that 41 people in Wuhan were found to\nhave the acute respiratory syndrome and 27 of them had contact with Huanan Seafood\nMarket 3. The 2019-nCoV was found in 33 out of 585 samples collected in the market after\nthe outbreak. The market was suspicious to be the origin of the epidemic, and was shut\ndown according to the rule of quarantine the source during an epidemic.\nThe bats carrying CoV ZC45 were originally found in Yunnan or Zhejiang province,\nboth of which were more than 900 kilometers away from the seafood market. Bats were\nnormally found to live in caves and trees. But the seafood market is in a densely-populated\ndistrict of Wuhan, a metropolitan of ~15 million people. The probability was very low for the\nbats to fly to the market. According to municipal reports and the testimonies of 31 residents\nand 28 visitors, the bat was never a food source in the city, and no bat was traded in the\nmarket. There was possible natural recombination or intermediate host of the coronavirus,\nyet little proof has been reported.\nWas there any other possible pathway? We screened the area around the seafood\nmarket and identified two laboratories conducting research on bat coronavirus. Within ~280\nmeters from the market, there was the Wuhan Center for Disease Control & Prevention\n(WHCDC) (Figure 1, from Baidu and Google maps). WHCDC hosted animals in laboratories\nfor research purpose, one of which was specialized in pathogens collection and identification 4-\n6. In one of their studies, 155 bats including Rhinolophus affinis were captured in Hubei\nprovince, and other 450 bats were captured in Zhejiang province 4. The expert in collection\nwas noted in the Author Contributions (JHT). Moreover, he was broadcasted for collecting\nviruses on nation-wide newspapers and websites in 2017 and 2019 7,8. He described that\nhe was once by attacked by bats and the blood of a bat shot on his skin. He knew the\nextreme danger of the infection so he quarantined himself for 14 days 7. In another accident,\nhe quarantined himself again because bats peed on him. He was once thrilled for capturing\na bat carrying a live tick 8.\nSurgery was performed on the caged animals and the tissue samples were collected for\nDNA and RNA extraction and sequencing 4, 5. The tissue samples and contaminated trashes\nwere source of pathogens. They were only ~280 meters from the seafood market. The\nWHCDC was also adjacent to the Union Hospital (Figure 1, bottom) where the first group\nof doctors were infected during this epidemic. It is plausible that the virus leaked around\nand some of them contaminated the initial patients in this epidemic, though solid proofs\nare needed in future study.\nThe second laboratory was ~12 kilometers from the seafood market and belonged to\nWuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences 1, 9, 10. This laboratory\nreported that the Chinese horseshoe bats were natural reservoirs for the severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) which caused the 2002-3 pandemic 9.\nThe principle investigator participated in a project which generated a chimeric virus using\nthe SARS-CoV reverse genetics system, and reported the potential for human\nemergence 10. A direct speculation was that SARS-CoV or its derivative might leak from\nthe laboratory.\nIn summary, somebody was entangled with the evolution of 2019-nCoV coronavirus.\nIn addition to origins of natural recombination and intermediate host, the killer coronavirus\nprobably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan. Safety level may need to be reinforced in\nhigh risk biohazardous laboratories. Regulations may be taken to relocate these\nlaboratories far away from city center and other densely populated places.\nContributors\nBX designed the comment and performed literature search.

The evolution of 2019-nCoV remains elusive. We found 4 insertions in the spike glycoprotein (S) which are unique to the 2019-nCoV and are not present in other coronaviruses. Importantly, amino acid residues in all the 4 inserts have identity or similarity to those in the HIV-1 gp120 or HIV-1 Gag. Interestingly, despite the inserts being discontinuous on the primary amino acid sequence, 3D-modelling of the 2019-nCoV suggests that they converge to constitute the receptor binding site. The finding of 4 unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV, all of which have identity /similarity to amino acid residues in key structural proteins of HIV-1 is unlikely to be fortuitous in nature. This work provides yet unknown insights on 2019-nCoV and sheds light on the evolution and pathogenicity of this virus with important implications for diagnosis of this virus.\nIntroduction\nCoronaviruses (CoV) are single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses that infect animals and humans. These are classified into 4 genera based on their host specificity: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus (Snijder et al., 2006). There are seven known types of CoVs that includes 229E and NL63 (Genus Alphacoronavirus), OC43, HKU1, MERS and SARS (Genus Betacoronavirus). While 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 commonly infect humans, the SARS and MERS outbreak in 2002 and 2012 respectively occurred when the virus crossed-over from animals to humans causing significant mortality (J. Chan et al., n.d.; J. F. W. Chan et al., 2015). In December 2019, another outbreak of coronavirus was reported from Wuhan, China that also transmitted from animals to humans. This new virus has been temporarily termed as 2019-novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO) (J. F.-W. Chan et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). While there are several hypotheses about the origin of 2019-nCoV, the source of this ongoing outbreak remains elusive.\nThe transmission patterns of 2019-nCoV is similar to patterns of transmission documented in the previous outbreaks including by bodily or aerosol contact with persons infected with the virus.\nIt is made available under a CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.\npreprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\nbioRxiv preprint first posted online Jan. 31, 2020; doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.30.927871.

This outbreak has spread rapidly distant nations including France, Australia and USA among others. The number of cases within and outside China are increasing steeply. Our current understanding is limited to the virus genome sequences and modest epidemiological and clinical data. Comprehensive analysis of the available 2019- nCoV sequences may provide important clues that may help advance our current understanding to manage the ongoing outbreak.\nThe spike glycoprotein (S) of cornonavirus is cleaved into two subunits (S1 and S2). The S1 subunit helps in receptor binding and the S2 subunit facilitates membrane fusion (Bosch et al., 2003; Li, 2016). The spike glycoproteins of coronoviruses are important determinants of tissue tropism and host range. In addition the spike glycoproteins are critical targets for vaccine development (Du et al., 2013). For this reason, the spike proteins represent the most extensively studied among coronaviruses. We therefore sought to investigate the spike glycoprotein of the 2019-nCoV to understand its evolution, novel features sequence and structural features using computational tools.\nMethodology\nRetrieval and alignment of nucleic acid and protein sequences\nWe retrieved all the available coronavirus sequences (n=55) from NCBI viral genome database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and we used the GISAID (Elbe & Buckland-Merrett, 2017)[https://www.gisaid.org/] to retrieve all available full-length sequences (n=28) of 2019-nCoV as on 27 Jan 2020. Multiple sequence alignment of all coronavirus genomes was performed by using MUSCLE software (Edgar, 2004) based on neighbour joining method. Out of 55 coronavirus genome 32 representative genomes of all category were used for phylogenetic tree development using MEGAX software (Kumar et al., 2018). The closest relative was found to be SARS CoV. The glycoprotein region of SARS CoV and 2019-nCoV were aligned and visualized using Multalin software (Corpet, 1988). The identified amino acid and nucleotide sequence were aligned with whole viral genome database using BLASTp and BLASTn. The conservation of the nucleotide and amino acid motifs in 28 clinical variants of 2019-nCoV genome were presented by performing multiple sequence alignment using MEGAX software. The three dimensional structure of 2019-nCoV glycoprotein was generated by using SWISS-MODEL online server (Biasini et al., 2014) and the structure was marked and visualized by using PyMol (DeLano, 2002).\nResults\nUncanny similarity of novel inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag\nOur phylogentic tree of full-length coronaviruses suggests that 2019-nCoV is closely related to SARS CoV [Fig1]. In addition, other recent studies have linked the 2019-nCoV to SARS CoV. We therefore compared the spike glycoprotein sequences of the 2019-nCoV to that of the SARS CoV (NCBI Accession number: AY390556.1). On careful examination of the sequence alignment we found that the 2019- nCoV spike glycoprotein contains 4 insertions [Fig.2]. To further investigate if these inserts are present in any other corona virus, we performed a multiple\nIt is made available under a CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.\npreprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\nbioRxiv preprint first posted online Jan. 31, 2020; doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.30.927871.

We found that these 4 insertions [inserts 1, 2, 3 and 4] are unique to 2019-nCoV and are not present in other coronaviruses analyzed. Another group from China had documented three insertions comparing fewer spike glycoprotein sequences of coronaviruses . Another group from China had documented three insertions comparing fewer spike glycoprotein sequences of coronaviruses (Zhou et al., 2020).\nFigure 1: Maximum likelihood genealogy show the evolution of 2019- nCoV: The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method and JTT matrix-based model.

Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA X.\nFigure 2: Multiple sequence alignment between spike proteins of 2019-nCoV and SARS. The sequences of spike proteins of 2019-nCoV (Wuhan-HU-1, Accession NC_045512) and of SARS CoV (GZ02, Accession AY390556) were aligned using MultiAlin software. The sites of difference are highlighted in boxes.\nWe then analyzed all available full-length sequences (n=28) of 2019-nCoV in GISAID (Elbe & Buckland-Merrett, 2017) as on January 27, 2020 for the presence of these inserts. As most of these sequences are not annotated, we compared the nucleotide sequences of the spike glycoprotein of all available 2019-nCoV sequences using BLASTp. Interestingly, all the 4 insertions were absolutely (100%) conserved in all the available 2019- nCoV sequences analyzed [Fig.S2, Fig.S3].\nIt is made available under a CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.\npreprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\nbioRxiv preprint first posted online Jan. 31, 2020; doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.30.927871. The copyright holder for this\nWe then translated the aligned genome and found that these inserts are present in all Wuhan 2019-nCoV viruses except the 2019-nCoV virus of Bat as a host [Fig.S4]. Intrigued by the 4 highly conserved inserts unique to 2019-nCoV we wanted to understand their origin. For this purpose, we used the 2019-nCoV local alignment with each insert as query against all virus genomes and considered hits with 100% sequence coverage. Surprisingly, each of the four inserts aligned with short segments of the Human immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) proteins. The amino acid positions of the inserts in 2019-nCoV and the corresponding residues in HIV-1 gp120 and HIV-1 Gag are shown in Table 1. The first 3 inserts (insert 1,2 and 3) aligned to short segments of amino acid residues in HIV-1 gp120. The insert 4 aligned to HIV-1 Gag. The insert 1 (6 amino acid residues) and insert 2 (6 amino acid residues) in the spike glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV are 100% identical to the residues mapped to HIV-1 gp120. The insert 3 (12 amino acid residues) in 2019- nCoV maps to HIV-1 gp120 with gaps [see Table 1]. The insert 4 (8 amino acid residues) maps to HIV-1 Gag with gaps.\nAlthough, the 4 inserts represent discontiguous short stretches of amino acids in spike glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV, the fact that all three of them share amino acid identity or similarity with HIV-1 gp120 and HIV-1 Gag (among all annotated virus proteins) suggests that this is not a random fortuitous finding. In other words, one may sporadically expect a fortuitous match for a stretch of 6-12 contiguous amino acid residues in an unrelated protein. However, it is unlikely that all 4 inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein fortuitously match with 2 key structural proteins of an unrelated virus (HIV-1).\nThe amino acid residues of inserts 1, 2 and 3 of 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein that mapped to HIV-1 were a part of the V4, V5 and V1 domains respectively in gp120 [Table 1]. Since the 2019-nCoV inserts mapped to variable regions of HIV-1, they were not ubiquitous in HIV-1 gp120, but were limited to selected sequences of HIV-1 [ refer S.File1] primarily from Asia and Africa.\nThe HIV-1 Gag protein enables interaction of virus with negatively charged host surface (Murakami, 2008) and a high positive charge on the Gag protein is a key feature for the host-virus interaction. On analyzing the pI values for each of the 4 inserts in 2019-nCoV and the corresponding stretches of amino acid residues from HIV-1 proteins we found that a) the pI values were very similar for each pair analyzed b) most of these pI values were 10\u00b12 [Refer Table 1] . Of note, despite the gaps in inserts 3 and 4 the pI values were comparable. This uniformity in the pI values for all the 4 inserts merits further investigation.\nAs none of these 4 inserts are present in any other coronavirus, the genomic region encoding these inserts represent ideal candidates for designing primers that can distinguish 2019-nCoV from other coronaviruses.

The comparison of the modelled structure reveals that although inserts 1,2 and 3 are at non-contiguous locations in the protein primary sequence, they fold to constitute the part of glycoprotein binding site that recognizes the host receptor (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016) (Figure 4). The insert 1 corresponds to the NTD (N-terminal domain) and the inserts 2 and 3 correspond to the CTD (C-terminal domain) of the S1 subunit in the 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein. The insert 4 is at the junction of the SD1 (sub domain 1) and SD2 (sub domain 2) of the S1 subunit (Ou et al., 2017). We speculate, that these insertions provide additional flexibility to the glycoprotein binding site by forming a hydrophilic loop in the protein structure that may facilitate or enhance virus-host interactions.

The inserts from HIV envelop protein are shown with colored beads, present at the binding site of the protein.\nEvolutionary Analysis of 2019-nCoV\nIt has been speculated that 2019-nCoV is a variant of Coronavirus derived from an animal source which got transmitted to humans. Considering the change of specificity for host, we decided to study the sequences of spike glycoprotein (S protein) of the virus. S proteins are surface proteins that help the virus in host recognition and attachment. Thus, a change in these proteins can be reflected as a change of host specificity of the virus. To know the alterations in S protein gene of 2019-nCoV and its consequences in structural re-arrangements we performed in-sillico analysis of 2019-nCoV with respect to all other viruses. A multiple sequence alignment between the S protein amino acid sequences of 2019-nCoV, Bat-SARS-Like, SARS-GZ02 and MERS revealed that S protein has evolved with closest significant diversity from the SARS-GZ02 (Figure 1).\nInsertions in Spike protein region of 2019-nCoV\nSince the S protein of 2019-nCoV shares closest ancestry with SARS GZ02, the sequence coding for spike proteins of these two viruses were compared using MultiAlin software. We found four new insertions in the protein of 2019-nCoV- \u201cGTNGTKR\u201d (IS1), \u201cHKNNKS\u201d (IS2), \u201cGDSSSG\u201d (IS3) and \u201cQTNSPRRA\u201d (IS4) (Figure 2). To our surprise, these sequence insertions were not only absent in S protein of SARS but were also not observed in any other member of the Coronaviridae family (Supplementary figure). This is startling as it is quite unlikely for a virus to have acquired such unique insertions naturally in a short duration of time.

The copyright holder for this\nInsertions share similarity to HIV\nThe insertions were observed to be present in all the genomic sequences of 2019-nCoV virus available from the recent clinical isolates (Supplementary Figure 1). To know the source of these insertions in 2019-nCoV a local alignment was done with BLASTp using these insertions as query with all virus genome. Unexpectedly, all the insertions got aligned with Human immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1). Further analysis revealed that aligned sequences of HIV-1 with 2019-nCoV were derived from surface glycoprotein gp120 (amino acid sequence positions: 404-409, 462-467, 136-150) and from Gag protein (366-384 amino acid) (Table 1). Gag protein of HIV is involved in host membrane binding, packaging of the virus and for the formation of virus-like particles. Gp120 plays crucial role in recognizing the host cell by binding to the primary receptor CD4.This binding induces structural rearrangements in GP120, creating a high affinity binding site for a chemokine co-receptor like CXCR4 and/or CCR5.\nDiscussion\nThe current outbreak of 2019-nCoV warrants a thorough investigation and understanding of its ability to infect human beings. Keeping in mind that there has been a clear change in the preference of host from previous coronaviruses to this virus, we studied the change in spike protein between 2019-nCoV and other viruses. We found four new insertions in the S protein of 2019-nCoV when compared to its nearest relative, SARS CoV. The genome sequence from the recent 28 clinical isolates showed that the sequence coding for these insertions are conserved amongst all these isolates. This indicates that these insertions have been preferably acquired by the 2019-nCoV, providing it with additional survival and infectivity advantage. Delving deeper we found that these insertions were similar to HIV-1. Our results highlight an astonishing relation between the gp120 and Gag protein of HIV, with 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein. These proteins are critical for the viruses to identify and latch on to their host cells and for viral assembly (Beniac et al., 2006). Since surface proteins are responsible for host tropism, changes in these proteins imply a change in host specificity of the virus. According to reports from China, there has been a gain of host specificity in case 2019-nCoV as the virus was originally known to infect animals and not humans but after the mutations, it has gained tropism to humans as well.\nMoving ahead, 3D modelling of the protein structure displayed that these insertions are present at the binding site of 2019-nCoV. Due to the presence of gp120 motifs in 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein at its binding domain, we propose that these motif insertions could have provided an enhanced affinity towards host cell receptors. Further, this structural change might have also increased the range of host cells that 2019-nCoV can infect. To the best of our knowledge, the function of these motifs is still not clear in HIV and need to be explored. The exchange of genetic material among the viruses is well known and such critical exchange highlights the risk and the need to investigate the relations between seemingly unrelated virus families.\nConclusions\nOur analysis of the spike glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV revealed several interesting findings: First, we identified 4 unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein that are not present in any other coronavirus reported till date.

This uncanny similarity of novel inserts in the 2019- nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag is unlikely to be fortuitous. Further, 3D modelling suggests that atleast 3 of the unique inserts which are non-contiguous in the primary protein sequence of the 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein converge to constitute the key components of the receptor binding site. Of note, all the 4 inserts have pI values of around 10 that may facilitate virus-host interactions. Taken together, our findings suggest unconventional evolution of 2019-nCoV that warrants further investigation. Our work highlights novel evolutionary aspects of the 2019-nCoV and has implications on the pathogenesis and diagnosis of this virus.\nReferences\nBeniac, D.

Very little advanced research had been done in variable-thrust rocket engines up to that point.

(In fact, accidental ingestion of helium pressurant proved to be a problem on [[AS-201]], the first flight of the Apollo Service Module engine in February 1966.) Therefore, MSC directed Grumman to conduct a parallel development program of competing designs.<ref name=\"chariots_LMengines\"/>\n\nGrumman held a bidders' conference on March 14, 1963, attended by [[Aerojet|Aerojet General]], Reaction Motors Division of [[Thiokol]], United Technology Center Division of [[United Aircraft]], and Space Technology Laboratories, Inc.

Therefore, the first order of business was to re-establish the free return trajectory with a 30.7-second burn of the LMDE. The descent engine was used again two hours after [[pericynthion]], the closest approach to the Moon (\"PC+2 burn\"), to speed the return to Earth by 10 hours and move the landing spot from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean.

Between 1994 and 1997, Strang was employed at the Institute of Social and Cultural Anthropology and the [[Pitt Rivers Museum]], while continuing her studies at Oxford's Environmental Change Institute.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 2000, Strang received an award for the Royal Anthropological Institute Fellowship in Urgent Anthropology. She moved to Australia shortly after this and worked closely with Australian and New Zealand communities, holding positions at the Auckland University of Technology and the University of Auckland. Her focus on the sociocultural understandings and use of water resources deepened during this time, and she published ''Gardening the World; agency, identity, and the ownership of water'' in 2009.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gardening the world : agency, identity and the ownership of water|first=Veronica|last=Strang|date=2013|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=9781782381303|oclc=854722731}}</ref>\n\nStrang has been living in the UK since 2012, and served Chair of the Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and the Commonwealth from 2012 to 2017.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Scholarship ==\nMuch of Strang's work focuses on the sociocultural value and perception of water resources. Her second major publication, ''The Meaning of Water,'' introduced this theme in 2004; she has since worked on multiple projects that examine the relationship between specific communities and nearby water bodies.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The meaning of water|first=Veronica|last=Strang|date=2003|publisher=Berg|isbn=9781859737538|location=|pages=|oclc=505383498}}</ref>\n\nStrang's methodology is structured around her belief in interdisciplinary academia and collaborative research.<ref name=\":0\" /> Her work with [[UNESCO]] and, later, as an ally to the Maori Council may classify her as a [[Public anthropology|public anthropologist]]. In keeping with this, her research aims for productive, applied outcomes, generally for the benefit of either the environment or for the communities she works alongside.\n\nIn her book ''The Anthropology of Sustainability,'' Strang notes her desire for anthropology to grow into a collaborative discipline that examines not only the human experience but its environmental context. She criticizes the [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia Hypothesis]] for its oversimplification of the world as a self-regulating system, and for its placement of humanity in a \"stewardship\" position instead of as just another species whose actions exist and play out in a complex web removed from anyone's direct control.<ref>{{Citation|last=Strang|first=Veronica|title=The Anthropology of Sustainability: Beyond Development and Progress|date=2017|work=|volume=|pages=|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US|isbn=9781137566355|doi=10.1057/978-1-137-56636-2_1}}</ref>\n\n== Recognition ==\n\n* Royal Anthropological Institute Fellowship in Urgent Anthropology, 2000\n* International Water Prize, UNESCO, 2007\n* HEFCE's national Interdisciplinary Advisory Panel Fellowship, 2017\n* Chair of the Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK, 2013\u20132017\n\n== Selected publications ==\n;Authored books\n\n* Strang, V.

Between 1994 and 1997, Strang was employed at the Institute of Social and Cultural Anthropology and the [[Pitt Rivers Museum]], while continuing her studies at Oxford\u2019s Environmental Change Institute.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 2000, Strang received an award for the Royal Anthropological Institute Fellowship in Urgent Anthropology. She moved to Australia shortly after this and worked closely with Australian and New Zealand communities, holding positions at the Auckland University of Technology and the University of Auckland. Her focus on the sociocultural understandings and use of water resources deepened during this time, and she published ''Gardening the World; agency, identity, and the ownership of water'' in 2009.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gardening the world : agency, identity and the ownership of water|first=Veronica|last=Strang|date=2013|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=9781782381303|oclc=854722731}}</ref>\n\nStrang has been living in the UK since 2012, and served Chair of the Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and the Commonwealth from 2012 to 2017.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Scholarship ==\nMuch of Strang's work focuses on the sociocultural value and perception of water resources. Her second major publication, ''The Meaning of Water,'' introduced this theme in 2004; she has since worked on multiple projects that examine the relationship between specific communities and nearby water bodies.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The meaning of water|first=Veronica|last=Strang|date=2003|publisher=Berg|isbn=9781859737538|location=|pages=|oclc=505383498}}</ref>\n\nStrang's methodology is structured around her belief in interdisciplinary academia and collaborative research.<ref name=\":0\" /> Her work with [[UNESCO]] and, later, as an ally to the Maori Council may classify her as a [[Public anthropology|public anthropologist]]. In keeping with this, her research aims for productive, applied outcomes, generally for the benefit of either the environment or for the communities she works alongside.\n\nIn her book ''The Anthropology of Sustainability,'' Strang notes her desire for anthropology to grow into a collaborative discipline that examines not only the human experience but its environmental context. She criticizes the [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia Hypothesis]] for its oversimplification of the world as a self-regulating system, and for its placement of humanity in a \"stewardship\" position instead of as just another species whose actions exist and play out in a complex web removed from anyone's direct control.<ref>{{Citation|last=Strang|first=Veronica|title=The Anthropology of Sustainability: Beyond Development and Progress|date=2017|work=|volume=|pages=|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US|isbn=9781137566355|doi=10.1057/978-1-137-56636-2_1}}</ref>\n\n== Recognition ==\n\n* Royal Anthropological Institute Fellowship in Urgent Anthropology, 2000\n* International Water Prize, UNESCO, 2007\n* HEFCE\u2019s national Interdisciplinary Advisory Panel Fellowship, 2017\n* Chair of the Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK, 2013-2017\n\n== Selected Publications ==\n;Authored Books\n\n* Strang, V.

When two clients encounter each other, a unique TCN is generated, exchanged, and then locally stored in a contact log. Then, once a user tests positive for infection, a report is sent to a central server. Each client on the network then collects the seeds from the server and independently checks their local contact logs for a TCN derived from any of the seeds. If a TCN can be derived, then the user has come in close contact with an infected patient, and is warned by the client. Since each device locally verifies contact logs, and thus contact logs are never transmitted to third parties, the central reporting server cannot by itself ascertain the identity or contact log of any client in the network. This is in contrast to competing protocols like BlueTrace, where the central reporting server receives and processes client contact logs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@frankvolkel/tracetogether-under-the-hood-7d5e509aeb5d|title=TraceTogether: under the hood|last=Liauw|first=\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddec Frank|date=2020-04-09|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n\n== Technical specification ==\nThe protocol can be divided into multiple areas: an encounter between two devices running TCN apps, and the notification of potential infection to users that came in contact with a patient. For the purposes of this specification, the protocol is divided into three distinct areas: the ''TCN identifier,'' the ''encounter handshake'', and ''infection reporting''. The ''encounter handshake'' runs on Bluetooth LE and defines how two devices acknowledge each other's presence. The ''infection reporting'' is built on [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTPS]] and defines how infection notices are distributed among clients.\n\n=== TCN identifier ===\nThe entire protocol is based on the principle of Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN), a unique and anonymous 128 bit identifier generated deterministically from a seed value on a client device. These TCN is used to identify people a with which a user has come in contact, and the seed is used as part of infection reporting. TCNs are also bound to a secret held by the client, which authenticates the integrity of a submitted report.\n\nTo generate a TCN, first a ''report authorization key'' (RAK) and ''report verification key'' (RVK) are created as the signing and verification keys of a signature scheme. Using the RAK, temporary contact keys (TCK) are generated using the algorithm <math>\ntck_{i} = H\\_tck(rvk || tck_{i-1})\n</math>, where <math>\ntck_{0} = H\\_tck(rak)\n</math>, and <math>\nH\\_tck()\n</math> is the [[SHA-2|SHA-256]] [[hash function]] as <math>\nH\\_tck(s) = SHA256(\\text{b'H}\\_\\text{TCK'}||s)\n</math>. From this, a TCN is generated from a given TCK using the algorithm <math>\ntcn_{i} = H\\_tcn(le\\_u16(i) || tck_{i})\n</math>, where <math>\ni>0\n</math>,  <math>\nle\\_u16()\n</math> formats a supplied number as a [[little endian]] unsigned 2 byte integer,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.rs/nom/2.2.1/nom/fn.le_u16.html|title=nom::le_u16 - Rust|website=docs.rs|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref> and <math>\nH\\_tcn()\n</math> is the SHA-256 hash function as <math>\nH\\_tcn(s) = SHA256(\\text{b'H}\\_\\text{TCN'}||s)[0:128]\n</math>. The following diagram demonstrates the key derivation process:[[File:TCN_Protocol_Key_Generation.svg|center]]RAK and RVKs are cycled on regular intervals to allow a client to report only specific periods of contact, and TCNs are unique to each device encounter. When a client wishes to submit a report for the period <math>\nj_1 > 0\n</math> to <math>\nj_2\n</math> it formats it using the structure <math>\nreport = rvk || tck_{j_1 - 1} || le\\_u16(j_1) || le\\_u16(j_2) || memo\n</math>. Because TCK's can only be used to derive equally positioned or future TCN's, by submitting the TCK used to generate the TCN before the start of the report no encounters prior can be revealed. However all future encounters using the RVK can be calculated, revealing the need to cycle RAK and RVKs. Additionally, since the RVK is used in the function to calculate a TCK, no valid TCNs can be derived from an unauthorized report (except the single TCN before the start of the report). In the structure, the memo is a space for freeform messages that differ between TCN implementations. The section is between 2 and 257 bytes, and made up of a tag identifying the originating implementation, as well as a data and data length pair. It is formatted as  <math>\nmemo = tag || len(data) || data\n</math>. The data is standardized for different tags, and can be as follows:\n\n* Tag {{Code|code=0x0}}: [[CoEpi]] symptom report v1\n* Tag {{Code|code=0x1}}: [[CovidWatch]] test result v1\n* Tag {{Code|code=0x2-0xfe}}: Allocated for future official TCN apps\n* Tag {{Code|code=0xff}}: reserved (can be used to add more than 256 types later)\n\nOnce a report is received, it's authenticity is verified with the algorithm:<math display=\"block\">\n\\begin{array}{lcr}\ntck_{j_1} = H\\_tck(rvk || tck_{j_1-1})\\\\\ntcn_{j_1} = H\\_tcn(le\\_u16(j1) || tck_{j_1})\\\\\ntck_{j_1+1} = H\\_tck(rvk || tck_{j_1})\\\\\ntcn_{j_1+1} = H\\_tcn(le\\_u16(j_1+1) || tck_{j_1+1})\n\\end{array}\n</math>This algorithm recalculates TCNs, and is also used by client devices to check their local contact logs for potential encounters with the infected patient. \n\n=== Encounter handshake ===\nWhen two devices come within range of each other, they exchange a handshake containing TCNs. In order to achieve this the encounter handshake operates in two modes (both with two sub-modes), broadcast oriented and connection oriented. Broadcast oriented operates using the modes broadcaster and observer, while connection oriented operates using peripheral and central. The two modes are used to circumvent certain device limitations, particularly in regard to iOS restrictions in place before version 13.4.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/fcww2x/feature_ios_134_beta_enables_ble_long_range/|title=r/iOSBeta - [Feature] IOS 13.4 beta enables BLE long range support (iPhone 11/11 Pro only)|website=reddit|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref> In both modes the protocol is identified with the 16 bit [[Universally unique identifier|UUID]] {{Code|code=0xC019}}.\n\nIn broadcast mode, a broadcaster advertises a 16-byte TCN using the service data field of the advertisement data. The observer reads the TCN from this field. In connection-oriented mode, the peripheral advertises using the UUID. The service exposes a read and writeable packet for sharing TCNs. After sharing a TCN, the central disconnects from the peripheral.\n\n=== Infection reporting ===\nWhen a user tests positive for infection, they upload a report to a central server.

When two clients encounter each other, a unique TCN is generated, exchanged, and then locally stored in a contact log. Then, once a user tests positive for infection, a report is sent to a central server. Each client on the network then collects the seeds from the server and independently checks their local contact logs for a TCN derived from any of the seeds. If a TCN can be derived, then the user has come in close contact with an infected patient, and is warned by the client. Since each device locally verifies contact logs, and thus contact logs are never transmitted to third parties, the central reporting server cannot by itself ascertain the identity or contact log of any client in the network. This is in contrast to competing protocols like BlueTrace, where the central reporting server receives and processes client contact logs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@frankvolkel/tracetogether-under-the-hood-7d5e509aeb5d|title=TraceTogether: under the hood|last=Liauw|first=\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddec Frank|date=2020-04-09|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n\n== Technical specification ==\nThe protocol can be divided into multiple areas: an encounter between two devices running TCN apps, and the notification of potential infection to users that came in contact with a patient. For the purposes of this specification, the protocol is divided into three distinct areas: the ''TCN identifier,'' the ''encounter handshake'', and ''infection reporting''. The ''encounter handshake'' runs on Bluetooth LE and defines how two devices acknowledge each other's presence. The ''infection reporting'' is built on [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTPS]] and defines how infection notices are distributed among clients.\n\n=== TCN identifier ===\nThe entire protocol is based on the principle of Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN), a unique and anonymous 128 bit identifier generated deterministically from a seed value on a client device. These TCN is used to identify people a with which a user has come in contact, and the seed is used as part of infection reporting. TCNs are also bound to a secret held by the client, which authenticates the integrity of a submitted report.\n\nTo generate a TCN, first a ''report authorization key'' (RAK) and ''report verification key'' (RVK) are created as the signing and verification keys of a signature scheme. Using the RAK, temporary contact keys (TCK) are generated using the algorithm <math>\ntck_{i} = H\\_tck(rvk || tck_{i-1})\n</math>, where <math>\ntck_{0} = H\\_tck(rak)\n</math>, and <math>\nH\\_tck()\n</math> is the [[SHA-2|SHA-256]] [[hash function]] as <math>\nH\\_tck(s) = SHA256(\\text{b'H}\\_\\text{TCK'}||s)\n</math>. From this, a TCN is generated from a given TCK using the algorithm <math>\ntcn_{i} = H\\_tcn(le\\_u16(i) || tck_{i})\n</math>, where <math>\ni>0\n</math>,  <math>\nle\\_u16()\n</math> formats a supplied number as a [[little endian]] unsigned 2 byte integer,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.rs/nom/2.2.1/nom/fn.le_u16.html|title=nom::le_u16 - Rust|website=docs.rs|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref> and <math>\nH\\_tcn()\n</math> is the SHA-256 hash function as <math>\nH\\_tcn(s) = SHA256(\\text{b'H}\\_\\text{TCN'}||s)[0:128]\n</math>. The following diagram demonstrates the key derivation process:[[File:TCN_Protocol_Key_Generation.svg|center]]RAK and RVKs are cycled on regular intervals to allow a client to report only specific periods of contact, and TCNs are unique to each device encounter. When a client wishes to submit a report for the period <math>\nj_1 > 0\n</math> to <math>\nj_2\n</math> it formats it using the structure <math>\nreport = rvk || tck_{j_1 - 1} || le\\_u16(j_1) || le\\_u16(j_2) || memo\n</math>. Because TCK's can only be used to derive equally positioned or future TCN's, by submitting the TCK used to generate the TCN before the start of the report no encounters prior can be revealed. However all future encounters using the RVK can be calculated, revealing the need to cycle RAK and RVKs. Additionally, since the RVK is used in the function to calculate a TCK, no valid TCNs can be derived from an unauthorized report (except the single TCN before the start of the report. In the structure, the memo is a space for freeform messages that differ between TCN implementations. The section is between 2 and 257 bytes, and made up of a tag identifying the originating implementation, as well as a data and data length pair. It is formatted as  <math>\nmemo = tag || len(data) || data\n</math>. The data is standardized for different tags, and can be as follows:\n\n* Tag {{Code|code=0x0}}: [[CoEpi]] symptom report v1\n* Tag {{Code|code=0x1}}: [[CovidWatch]] test result v1\n* Tag {{Code|code=0x2-0xfe}}: Allocated for future official TCN apps\n* Tag {{Code|code=0xff}}: reserved (can be used to add more than 256 types later)\n\nOnce a report is received, it's authenticity is verified with the algorithm:<math display=\"block\">\n\\begin{array}{lcr}\ntck_{j_1} = H\\_tck(rvk || tck_{j_1-1})\\\\\ntcn_{j_1} = H\\_tcn(le\\_u16(j1) || tck_{j_1})\\\\\ntck_{j_1+1} = H\\_tck(rvk || tck_{j_1})\\\\\ntcn_{j_1+1} = H\\_tcn(le\\_u16(j_1+1) || tck_{j_1+1})\n\\end{array}\n</math>This algorithm recalculates TCNs, and is also used by client devices to check their local contact logs for potential encounters with the infected patient. \n\n=== Encounter handshake ===\nWhen two devices come within range of each other, they exchange a handshake containing TCNs. In order to achieve this the encounter handshake operates in two modes (both with two sub-modes), broadcast oriented and connection oriented. Broadcast oriented operates using the modes broadcaster and observer, while connection oriented operates using peripheral and central. The two modes are used to circumvent certain device limitations, particularly in regard to iOS restrictions in place before version 13.4.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/fcww2x/feature_ios_134_beta_enables_ble_long_range/|title=r/iOSBeta - [Feature] IOS 13.4 beta enables BLE long range support (iPhone 11/11 Pro only)|website=reddit|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref> In both modes the protocol is identified with the 16 bit [[Universally unique identifier|UUID]] {{Code|code=0xC019}}.\n\nIn broadcast mode, a broadcaster advertises a 16-byte TCN using the service data field of the advertisement data. The observer reads the TCN from this field. In connection-oriented mode, the peripheral advertises using the UUID. The service exposes a read and writeable packet for sharing TCNs. After sharing a TCN, the central disconnects from the peripheral.\n\n=== Infection reporting ===\nWhen a user tests positive for infection, they upload a report to a central server. Devices then, on a regular basis, download reports from the server and check their local contact logs using the verification algorithm. If there is a matching record, the app notifies the user to potential infection.\n\n== TCN Coalition ==\nOn 5 April 2020, the global [[TCN Coalition]] was founded by groups that had coalesced around what was essentially the same approach and largely overlapping protocols, with the goal to reduce fragmentation, and enable global interoperability of tracing and alerting apps, a key aspect of achieving widespread adoption.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=https://tcn-coalition.org/|title=TCN Coalition \u00b7 A Global Coalition for Privacy-First Digital Contact Tracing Protocols to Fight COVID-19|website=tcn-coalition.org|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref> The TCN Coalition also helped establish the [[Data Rights for Digital Contact Tracing and Alerting]] framework, which functions as a bill of rights for users of such apps.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dcta-datarights.com/|title=Data Rights for Digital Contact Tracing and Alerting \u00b7 Overview|last=Reed <questions@dcta-datarights.org>|first=Harper|website=dcta-datarights.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n== Implementation ==\nThe protocol is currently used by the COVID-19 contact tracing apps [[CoEpi]] and [[CovidWatch]], and was likely a source of inspiration for the similar [[Google / Apple contact tracing project]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://covid-watch.org/press_releases/google_apple_press_release|title=Covid Watch Celebrates Apple and Google\u2019s COVID-19 Contact Tracing Announcement|last=|first=|date=|website=www.covid-watch.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[BlueTrace]]\n* [[Google / Apple contact tracing project]]\n\n== References ==\n\n[[Category:Application layer protocols]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 2020]]\n[[Category:Software associated with the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]\n[[Category:Bluetooth software]]\n[[Category:Medical software]]\n[[Category:Android (operating system) software]]\n[[Category:IOS software]]\n[[Category:2020 software]]\n[[Category:Software using the MIT license]]\n[[Category:Digital contact tracing protocols]]\n<references />{{2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}{{FOSS}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* [https://tcn-coalition.org/ TCN Coalition]\n* [https://github.com/TCNCoalition/TCN Specification and reference implementation]\n", "name_user": "Bravetheif", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTCN identifier:Typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCN_Protocol"}

This art group sought to combine ancient Iraqi heritage with modern art and architecture, in order to develop an Iraqi aesthetic, that was not only unique to Iraq, but also influence the development of a pan-Arab visual language.\n\nChadirji's early works were firmly grounded in the discourse being conducted by members of the [[Iraqi art#Jama\u2019et Baghdad lil Fenal-Hadith (The Baghdad Modern Art Group)|Baghdad Modern Art Group]],<ref>Bernhardsson, M.T., \"Visions of the Past: Modernizing the Past in 1950s Baghdad,\" in Sandy Isenstadt and Kishwar Rizvi, ''Modernism and the Middle East: Architecture and Politics in the Twentieth Century,\" University of Washington Press, 2008, pp 91-92</ref> including sculptors [[Jawad Saleem]] and [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]], and artist-intellectual, [[Shakir Hassan Al Said]].

This art group sought to combine ancient Iraqi heritage with modern art and architecture, in order to develop an Iraqi aesthetic, that was not only unique to Iraq, but also influence the development of a pan-Arab visual language.\n\nChadirji's early works were firmly grounded in the discourse being conducted by members of the [[Iraqi art#Jama\u2019et Baghdad lil Fenal-Hadith (The Baghdad Modern Art Group)|Baghdad Modern Art Group]],<ref>Bernhardsson, M.T., \"Visions of the Past: Modernizing the Past in 1950s Baghdad,\" in Sandy Isenstadt and Kishwar Rizvi, ''Modernism and the Middle East: Architecture and Politics in the Twentieth Century,\" University of Washington Press, 2008, pp 91-92</ref> including sculptors [[Jawad Saleem]] and [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]], and artist-intellectual, [[Shakir Hassan Al Said]].

Makiya was the son of prominent Iraqi architect, Mohammed Makiya, of whom Chadirji had been highly critical.</ref>\n\nChadirji's early works were primarily reconstructions of old buildings. In 1959, he was commissioned to construct a major public monument, ''[[The Monument to the Unknown Soldier#First Unknown Soldier monumental arch|The Monument to the Unknown Soldier]]'', which was later destroyed by [[Saddam Hussein]]'s Ba'athist government, and replaced with a statue of Hussein himself.

He also employed the architectural language of arches and monolithic piers that remind visitors of ancient Iraqi architectural history.
