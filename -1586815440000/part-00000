In 1798, in the area of \u200b\u200bthe current City Palace of Culture, a wooden Pokrovskaya single-faith church was built. At the beginning of the 19th century, a stone church was built in a new place (GDK square). In place of the central part of Suvorov Square, a bridge was built across the river that flows into the Dniester. The bridge connected the western and eastern parts of the city and existed until the reconstruction of the center of Tiraspol in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1912, at the entrance to the bridge, on the west side, a Arc de Triomphe was installed in honor of the 100th anniversary of the victory in the [[Patriotic War]]. A chapel-monument to Tsar [[Alexander II]] was erected n Pokrovskaya Square. In Soviet times, Pokrovskaya Square was renamed the Stalin Constitution Square,<ref>{{cite web|title=\u0412 \u041f\u0440\u0438\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044c\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0442\u0438 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0443\u043b\u0438\u0446\u044b \u0441\u043e\u0445\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0436\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f|url=https://m.point.md/ru/novosti/obschestvo/v-pridnestrovje-pochti-vse-ulici-sohranili-svoi-prezhnie-nazvaniya|publisher=point.md|accessdate=2017-08-07}}</ref> and later the Sqaure of the Soviet Constitution.<ref>{{cite web|title=\u041d\u0430\u0434 \u0442\u0440\u0438\u0431\u0443\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0442\u0443\u0447\u0438 \u0445\u043e\u0434\u044f\u0442 \u0445\u043c\u0443\u0440\u043e|url=http://karavan.md/article/83|publisher=karavan.md|accessdate=2017-08-01}}</ref> Since the 1970s, the square began to take on recognizable features: the majestic Memorial of Glory was built and in 1979 an equestrian monument to Suvorov was erected, which became the symbol of the city.

In 1798, in the area of \u200b\u200bthe current City Palace of Culture, a wooden Pokrovskaya single-faith church was built. At the beginning of the 19th century, a stone church was built in a new place (GDK square). In place of the central part of Suvorov Square, a bridge was built across the river that flows into the Dniester. The bridge connected the western and eastern parts of the city and existed until the reconstruction of the center of Tiraspol in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1912, at the entrance to the bridge, on the west side, a Arc de Triomphe was installed in honor of the 100th anniversary of the victory in the [[Patriotic War]]. A chapel-monument to Tsar [[Alexander II]] was erected n Pokrovskaya Square.

The album is Canibus' first release on an [[independent record label]] (his first two albums, ''[[Can-I-Bus]]'' and ''[[2000 B.C. (album)|2000 B.C.]]'', were released on [[Universal Records]]).

Noll (Downers Grove, IL: IVP  Academic, 2009), 191.</ref> This article covers a period of just under two thousand years\n\nOver time, [[Schism (religion)|schisms]] have disrupted the unity of Christianity.

This Church has been the driving force behind some of the major events of world history including the [[Christianization]] of [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]] and [[Latin America]], the spreading of literacy and the foundation of the universities, hospitals, the Western tradition of [[monasticism]], the development of art and music, literature, architecture, contributions to the [[scientific method]], [[just war theory]] and [[trial by jury]]. It has played a powerful role in global affairs, including the [[Reconquista]], the [[Crusades]], the [[Inquisition]], the [[Investiture Controversy]], the establishment of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and the [[Revolutions of 1989|Fall]] of [[Communism]] in [[Eastern Europe]] in the late 20th century.\n\n==Ministry of Jesus and founding==\n{{Main|Chronology of Jesus}}\n[[File:Christ pantocrator daphne1090-1100.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Byzantine image depicting Jesus as Christ ''pantocrator'']]\n\n* 1 BC: [[Nativity of Jesus]]. According to the Gospel of Luke, his birth occurred in the town of [[Bethlehem]] during the reigns of King [[Herod the Great]] of [[Judea|Judaea]] and the Roman Emperor [[Augustus]], and he was the son of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]], who conceived him by the power of the [[Holy Spirit]]. Christians see Him as the Divine [[Son of God]] [[incarnate]] or [[God the Son]].\n:*The calculations of [[Dionysius Exiguus]] put the birth of Jesus in the year that in consequence is called 1 BC; historians place his birth some time between 6 and 1 BC.\n\n* 28 AD: Jesus' baptism, start of ministry, and selection of the Apostles. The Gospel of Luke indicates that Christ was baptized during the 15th year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar which is dated in 28 AD (found in Luke 3:1,21,22). Christian Gospels strongly suggest Peter as leader and spokesman of the Apostles of Jesus, being mentioned the most number of times in the Gospels. Peter, and the sons of Zebedee, James and John, constitute the inner circle of the Apostles of Jesus, being witnesses to specific important events of the life of Jesus; preachings of Jesus, such as the [[Sermon on the Mount]]; and performance of miracles, such as raising the dead back to life, feeding five-thousand, walking on water, etc.\n* 30 AD: Peter declares and other followers believe Jesus of Nazareth to be the Jewish Messiah promised by Yahweh according to the Jewish Scriptures and the predictions of the Hebrew prophets. Entry into Jerusalem, start of Passion of Christ. Jesus of Nazareth is [[crucifixion|crucified]] in [[Jerusalem]] under [[Pontius Pilate]], [[procurator (Roman)|procurator]] of [[Judea]] during the reign of [[Tiberius]] and [[Herod Antipas]], after the [[Sanhedrin]], under the High Priest [[Caiaphas]], accuse Jesus of blasphemy. He was then crucified under [[Pontius Pilate]]. According to his followers, three days later, God raised him from the dead.

This Church has been the driving force behind some of the major events of world history including the [[Christianization]] of [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]] and [[Latin America]], the spreading of literacy and the foundation of the universities, hospitals, the Western tradition of [[monasticism]], the development of art and music, literature, architecture, contributions to the [[scientific method]], [[just war theory]] and [[trial by jury]]. It has played a powerful role in global affairs, including the [[Reconquista]], the [[Crusades]], the [[Inquisition]], the [[Investiture Controversy]], the establishment of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and the [[Revolutions of 1989|Fall]] of [[Communism]] in [[Eastern Europe]] in the late 20th century.\n\n==Ministry of Jesus and founding==\n{{Main|Chronology of Jesus}}\n[[File:Christ pantocrator daphne1090-1100.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Byzantine image depicting Jesus as Christ ''pantocrator'']]\n\n* 1 BC: [[Nativity of Jesus]]. According to the Gospel of Luke, his birth occurred in the town of [[Bethlehem]] during the reigns of King [[Herod the Great]] of [[Judea|Judaea]] and the Roman Emperor [[Augustus]], and he was the son of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]], who conceived him by the power of the [[Holy Spirit]]. Christians see Him as the Divine [[Son of God]] [[incarnate]] or [[God the Son]].\n:*The calculations of [[Dionysius Exiguus]] put the birth of Jesus in the year that in consequence is called 1 BC; historians place his birth some time between 6 and 1 BC.\n\n* 28 AD: Jesus' baptism, start of ministry, and selection of the Apostles. The Gospel of Luke indicates that Christ was baptized during the 15th year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar which is dated in 28 AD (found in Luke 3:1,21,22). Christian Gospels strongly suggest Peter as leader and spokesman of the Apostles of Jesus, being mentioned the most number of times in the Gospels. Peter, and the sons of Zebedee, James and John, constitute the inner circle of the Apostles of Jesus, being witnesses to specific important events of the life of Jesus; preachings of Jesus, such as the [[Sermon on the Mount]]; and performance of miracles, such as raising the dead back to life, feeding five-thousand, walking on water, etc.\n* 30 AD: Peter declares and other followers believe Jesus of Nazareth to be the Jewish Messiah promised by Yahweh according to the Jewish Scriptures and the predictions of the Hebrew prophets. Entry into Jerusalem, start of Passion of Christ. Jesus of Nazareth is [[crucifixion|crucified]] in [[Jerusalem]] under [[Pontius Pilate]], [[procurator (Roman)|procurator]] of [[Judea]] during the reign of [[Tiberius]] and [[Herod Antipas]], after the [[Sanhedrin]], under the High Priest [[Caiaphas]], accuse Jesus of blasphemy. He was then crucified under [[Pontius Pilate]]. According to his followers, three days later, God raised him from the dead. Forty days after his [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] ([[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]]), the Christian Gospels narrate that [[Great Commission|Jesus instructed His disciples]] thus: \"All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of time.\" (Matthew 28:18\u201320). Ten days later ([[Pentecost]]) Peter makes the first sermon converting 3,000 to be baptized.\n\n==Early Christianity==\n{{Main|History of early Christianity}}\n\n*34 AD: [[Saint Stephen]], the first Christian [[martyr]], is stoned to death in Jerusalem.\n\n*40 AD: Traditional date of [[Our Lady of the Pillar]] showing up to [[James the Great]] in [[Santiago de Compostela]], [[Hispania|Spain]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/saint/nuestra-senora-del-pilar-our-lady-of-the-pillar-622|title=Nuestra Senora del Pilar (Our Lady of the Pillar)|website=[[Catholic News Agency]]|access-date=2019-05-30|quote=Unlike every other recorded apparition, this one took place during the earthly life of the Mother of God.}}</ref>\n\n* 50 AD: [[Council of Jerusalem]] determines that [[Gentile]] converts to Christianity do not have to abide by [[Mosaic Laws]].

On the title track, Canibus blames the commercial failure of his first album on the bland beats by [[Wyclef Jean]] whom he severed ties with to team up with various producers, ranging from [[Ty Fyffe]] to [[Irv Gotti]]. Allegedly, rapper [[Eminem]] was to be featured on the track \"Phuk U\", but turned down the offer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eminemlab.com/eminemenemies/canibus.html|title=Canibus - Eminem's Enemies, Rivals and Beefs|website=EminemLab|date=November 19, 2002|accessdate=August 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\nUniversal Records was reportedly underwhelmed by sales of the second release (the album was bootlegged heavily before the release), {{citation needed|date=October 2012}} and the label's contract with Canibus was terminated following the release of ''2000 B.C.''
