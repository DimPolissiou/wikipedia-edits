S. Ravikumar]], and featuring [[Sivaji Ganesan]], [[Rajinikanth]], [[Ramya Krishnan]] and [[Soundarya]] in the lead roles, with [[Abbas (actor)|Abbas]], [[Lakshmi (actress)|Lakshmi]], [[Radha Ravi]] and [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]] in supporting roles. The [[soundtrack album]] and [[background music|background score]] were composed by [[A. R. Rahman]].Initially, this movie was given to Vijay. But due to some reasons, Vijay rejected the offer.\n\nThe plot revolves around Padayappa (Rajinikanth), an engineer whose father (Sivaji Ganesan) dies of shock soon after he is defrauded and loses his property to his foster brother ([[Manivannan]]). Neelambari (Ramya Krishnan) initially loves Padayappa, but plans to take revenge on him and his love interest Vasundhara (Soundarya) after his family humiliates her father (Radha Ravi). The rest of the story deals with Padayappa climbing back to financial success and arranging his daughters' marriage while overcoming all the obstacles placed by Neelambari.\n\nPrincipal photography for the film began in October 1998. ''Padayappa'' was released on 10 April 1999 on the eve of [[Puthandu|Tamil New Year's Day]]. This was the first Tamil film to be released worldwide with 210 [[Publishing|prints]] and 700,000 audio cassettes. It became [[Tamil cinema]]'s highest-grossing film at that point. Ramya Krishnan's performance was praised, winning her a [[Filmfare Awards South|Filmfare Award]] under the [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress&nbsp;\u2013 Tamil|Best Actress]] category. The film also won five [[Tamil Nadu State Film Awards]].\n\n== Plot ==\nPadayappa is a mechanical engineer who returns to his village after three years to attend his sister's wedding. Padayappa's family have been the richest landlords of their village and chieftains for their region. Padayappa's great grandfather had decreed all Hindu marriages in their region must take place in the Murugan temple, after the chieftain has verbally confirmed the consent from bride and groom. This tradition has been followed for 100 years and now Padayappa's father is the chieftain. Padayappa's younger sister is engaged to their maternal cousin Suryaprakash. During his stay, he comes across Vasundhara, and falls in love with her. However, shyness and fear of Neelambari whose family employs her and her mother as servants, prevents Vasundhara from initially expressing her feelings. Neelambari is Suryaprakash's spoilt US-returned sister who also loves Padayappa.\n\nUnexpectedly, Padayappa's father's foster brother demands half share in the family property, citing Padayappa's father's donations to the poor are draining the family resources and he himself has three children to take care of. Padayappa's father abruptly refuses to divide the property and instead gives the entire property to his foster brother. This forces Padayappa's family to leave their home, to a plot of land bought using Padayappa's salary. Unable to bear this shock, Padayappa's father dies at the entrance of the house. Suryaprakash silently cancels his wedding with Padayappa's sister and marries the daughter of Padayappa's father's foster brother, who now owns the property of Padayappa's father.\n\nMeanwhile, Padayappa discovers that a hill on his newly purchased property is composed of solid [[granite]], which allows him to start a granite business, from which he becomes exponentially rich. He uses the money to help the poor in his village, and provide them jobs. As his business flourishes, his family is able to once again settle down. Padayappa assumes his father's position as the village chieftain, and his sister gets married to one of the engineers who work in his company. When Neelambari learns about Padayappa's love for Vasundhara, she becomes jealous of her, and her parents beg Padayappa's widowed mother to allow Neelambari to marry Padayappa. However, to everyone's surprise, Padayappa's mother humiliates Padayappa's maternal uncle in front of the entire village when she agrees to a marriage between Padayappa and Vasundhara with Vasundhara's mother, her brother's servant. Unable to bear the humiliation, Padayappa's maternal uncle commits suicide.\n\nWhen Neelambari tries to kill Vasundhara by letting a bull loose on her, Padayappa saves her. Neelambari tries to poison Vasundhara, which fails after a snake knocks down the milk she poisons. Afterwards, Padayappa and Vasundhara marry. After the wedding, Neelambari locks herself in a room in Suryaprakash's house, thinking only about Padayappa for 18 years, during which Suryaprakash becomes the state's home minister. In between, Padayappa finds his father's foster brother in trouble financially as he was pulled out of the family house by a financier Krishnasamy Mudaliar, from whom he had borrowed money on interest. Padayappa helps his father's foster brother, who in turn becomes indebted to him and seeks Padayappa's pardon for his misdeeds; Padayappa forgives him.\n\nNeelambari plans her revenge on Padayappa, now a father of two daughters. Suryaprakash also has a son, Chandru, who studies at the same college as Padayappa's elder daughter, Anitha. Neelambari advises Chandru to make Anitha fall in love with him. At the same time, Padayappa plans to get Anitha married to his sister's son. Neelambari, having made Chandru pretend to fall in love with Anitha, plans to humiliate Padayappa by making Anitha say that she does not wish to marry a groom of her parents' choice and that she is in love with someone else. At the marriage ceremony, after Anitha does what Neelambari told her, Padayappa makes an oath to unite Anitha with her lover by the next ''[[Muhurta]]'' day, or commit suicide. Padayappa discovers that Chandru really did fall in love with Anitha even though he was only initially pretending to do so on Neelambari's advise. When Padayappa takes Chandru and Anitha to the temple to get married, Neelambari and Suryaprakash give chase to stop them. Suryaprakash is killed in a car accident during the chase.\n\nArmed with a [[machine gun]], Neelambari reaches the temple where Chandru and Anitha are married. When she tries to kill Padayappa, he saves her life by preventing a bull from attacking her, while at the same time dodging the bullets she fires at him. Rather than live with the humiliation of knowing she was unsuccessful in avenging her father's death, as well as having her life saved by her enemy, Neelambari commits suicide, promising to take revenge on Padayappa in her next birth. Padayappa prays for her soul to be at peace and eventually attain salvation.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- In order of the film's opening credits -->\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Sivaji Ganesan]] as Padayappa's father\n* [[Rajinikanth]] as Aarupadayappan (Padayappa)\n* [[Ramya Krishnan]] as Neelambari\n* [[Soundarya]] as Vasundhara\n* [[Lakshmi (actress)|Lakshmi]] as Padayappa's mother\n* [[Sithara (actress)|Sithara]] as Padayappa's sister\n* [[Radha Ravi]] as Neelambari's father\n* [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]] as Suryaprakash, Neelambari's brother<!-- https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/692128 -->\n* [[Manivannan]] as Padayappa's father's foster brother\n* [[Senthil]] as Azhagesan\n* [[Abbas (actor)|Abbas]] as Chandraprakash aka Chandru\n* [[Preetha Vijayakumar|Preetha]] as Anitha\n* [[Anu Mohan (Tamil actor)|Anu Mohan]] as Chinnarasu\n* [[Ramesh Khanna]] as Murugesan\n* [[Vadivukkarasi]] as Vasundhara's mother\n* [[Sathyapriya]] as Neelambari's mother\n* [[Mansoor Ali Khan (actor)|Mansoor Ali Khan]] as Krishnasamy Mudaliar\n* [[Prakash Raj]] as Subramaniam\n* [[Vasu Vikram]] as Padayappa's cousin\n* [[Raja Ravindra]] as Padayappa's cousin\n* [[Lavanya (actress)|Lavanya]] as Suryaprakash's wife\n* [[Kanal Kannan]] as a farmer told by Neelambari to kill the snake\n* [[Mohan Raman]] as the lawyer\n* [[Ravi Raghavendra]] as Ravi Chellaiah\n* [[Kovai Senthil]] as a village man<!--https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/news/actor-kovai-senthil-passes-away-in-coimbatore/articleshow/65749144.cms-->\n* [[K.

S. Ravikumar]], and featuring [[Sivaji Ganesan]], [[Rajinikanth]], [[Ramya Krishnan]] and [[Soundarya]] in the lead roles, with [[Abbas (actor)|Abbas]], [[Lakshmi (actress)|Lakshmi]], [[Radha Ravi]] and [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]] in supporting roles. The [[soundtrack album]] and [[background music|background score]] were composed by [[A. R. Rahman]].\n\nThe plot revolves around Padayappa (Rajinikanth), an engineer whose father (Sivaji Ganesan) dies of shock soon after he is defrauded and loses his property to his foster brother ([[Manivannan]]). Neelambari (Ramya Krishnan) initially loves Padayappa, but plans to take revenge on him and his love interest Vasundhara (Soundarya) after his family humiliates her father (Radha Ravi). The rest of the story deals with Padayappa climbing back to financial success and arranging his daughters' marriage while overcoming all the obstacles placed by Neelambari.\n\nPrincipal photography for the film began in October 1998. ''Padayappa'' was released on 10 April 1999 on the eve of [[Puthandu|Tamil New Year's Day]]. This was the first Tamil film to be released worldwide with 210 [[Publishing|prints]] and 700,000 audio cassettes. It became [[Tamil cinema]]'s highest-grossing film at that point. Ramya Krishnan's performance was praised, winning her a [[Filmfare Awards South|Filmfare Award]] under the [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress&nbsp;\u2013 Tamil|Best Actress]] category. The film also won five [[Tamil Nadu State Film Awards]].\n\n== Plot ==\nPadayappa is a mechanical engineer who returns to his village after three years to attend his sister's wedding. Padayappa's family have been the richest landlords of their village and chieftains for their region. Padayappa's great grandfather had decreed all Hindu marriages in their region must take place in the Murugan temple, after the chieftain has verbally confirmed the consent from bride and groom. This tradition has been followed for 100 years and now Padayappa's father is the chieftain. Padayappa's younger sister is engaged to their maternal cousin Suryaprakash. During his stay, he comes across Vasundhara, and falls in love with her. However, shyness and fear of Neelambari whose family employs her and her mother as servants, prevents Vasundhara from initially expressing her feelings. Neelambari is Suryaprakash's spoilt US-returned sister who also loves Padayappa.\n\nUnexpectedly, Padayappa's father's foster brother demands half share in the family property, citing Padayappa's father's donations to the poor are draining the family resources and he himself has three children to take care of. Padayappa's father abruptly refuses to divide the property and instead gives the entire property to his foster brother. This forces Padayappa's family to leave their home, to a plot of land bought using Padayappa's salary. Unable to bear this shock, Padayappa's father dies at the entrance of the house. Suryaprakash silently cancels his wedding with Padayappa's sister and marries the daughter of Padayappa's father's foster brother, who now owns the property of Padayappa's father.\n\nMeanwhile, Padayappa discovers that a hill on his newly purchased property is composed of solid [[granite]], which allows him to start a granite business, from which he becomes exponentially rich. He uses the money to help the poor in his village, and provide them jobs. As his business flourishes, his family is able to once again settle down. Padayappa assumes his father's position as the village chieftain, and his sister gets married to one of the engineers who work in his company. When Neelambari learns about Padayappa's love for Vasundhara, she becomes jealous of her, and her parents beg Padayappa's widowed mother to allow Neelambari to marry Padayappa. However, to everyone's surprise, Padayappa's mother humiliates Padayappa's maternal uncle in front of the entire village when she agrees to a marriage between Padayappa and Vasundhara with Vasundhara's mother, her brother's servant. Unable to bear the humiliation, Padayappa's maternal uncle commits suicide.\n\nWhen Neelambari tries to kill Vasundhara by letting a bull loose on her, Padayappa saves her. Neelambari tries to poison Vasundhara, which fails after a snake knocks down the milk she poisons. Afterwards, Padayappa and Vasundhara marry. After the wedding, Neelambari locks herself in a room in Suryaprakash's house, thinking only about Padayappa for 18 years, during which Suryaprakash becomes the state's home minister. In between, Padayappa finds his father's foster brother in trouble financially as he was pulled out of the family house by a financier Krishnasamy Mudaliar, from whom he had borrowed money on interest. Padayappa helps his father's foster brother, who in turn becomes indebted to him and seeks Padayappa's pardon for his misdeeds; Padayappa forgives him.\n\nNeelambari plans her revenge on Padayappa, now a father of two daughters. Suryaprakash also has a son, Chandru, who studies at the same college as Padayappa's elder daughter, Anitha. Neelambari advises Chandru to make Anitha fall in love with him. At the same time, Padayappa plans to get Anitha married to his sister's son. Neelambari, having made Chandru pretend to fall in love with Anitha, plans to humiliate Padayappa by making Anitha say that she does not wish to marry a groom of her parents' choice and that she is in love with someone else. At the marriage ceremony, after Anitha does what Neelambari told her, Padayappa makes an oath to unite Anitha with her lover by the next ''[[Muhurta]]'' day, or commit suicide. Padayappa discovers that Chandru really did fall in love with Anitha even though he was only initially pretending to do so on Neelambari's advise. When Padayappa takes Chandru and Anitha to the temple to get married, Neelambari and Suryaprakash give chase to stop them. Suryaprakash is killed in a car accident during the chase.\n\nArmed with a [[machine gun]], Neelambari reaches the temple where Chandru and Anitha are married. When she tries to kill Padayappa, he saves her life by preventing a bull from attacking her, while at the same time dodging the bullets she fires at him. Rather than live with the humiliation of knowing she was unsuccessful in avenging her father's death, as well as having her life saved by her enemy, Neelambari commits suicide, promising to take revenge on Padayappa in her next birth. Padayappa prays for her soul to be at peace and eventually attain salvation.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- In order of the film's opening credits -->\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Sivaji Ganesan]] as Padayappa's father\n* [[Rajinikanth]] as Aarupadayappan (Padayappa)\n* [[Ramya Krishnan]] as Neelambari\n* [[Soundarya]] as Vasundhara\n* [[Lakshmi (actress)|Lakshmi]] as Padayappa's mother\n* [[Sithara (actress)|Sithara]] as Padayappa's sister\n* [[Radha Ravi]] as Neelambari's father\n* [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]] as Suryaprakash, Neelambari's brother<!-- https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/692128 -->\n* [[Manivannan]] as Padayappa's father's foster brother\n* [[Senthil]] as Azhagesan\n* [[Abbas (actor)|Abbas]] as Chandraprakash aka Chandru\n* [[Preetha Vijayakumar|Preetha]] as Anitha\n* [[Anu Mohan (Tamil actor)|Anu Mohan]] as Chinnarasu\n* [[Ramesh Khanna]] as Murugesan\n* [[Vadivukkarasi]] as Vasundhara's mother\n* [[Sathyapriya]] as Neelambari's mother\n* [[Mansoor Ali Khan (actor)|Mansoor Ali Khan]] as Krishnasamy Mudaliar\n* [[Prakash Raj]] as Subramaniam\n* [[Vasu Vikram]] as Padayappa's cousin\n* [[Raja Ravindra]] as Padayappa's cousin\n* [[Lavanya (actress)|Lavanya]] as Suryaprakash's wife\n* [[Kanal Kannan]] as a farmer told by Neelambari to kill the snake\n* [[Mohan Raman]] as the lawyer\n* [[Ravi Raghavendra]] as Ravi Chellaiah\n* [[Kovai Senthil]] as a village man<!--https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/news/actor-kovai-senthil-passes-away-in-coimbatore/articleshow/65749144.cms-->\n* [[K.

Fujian is bordered by [[Zhejiang]] to the north, [[Jiangxi]] to the west, [[Guangdong]] to the south, and the [[Taiwan Strait]] to the east. Its capital is [[Fuzhou]], while its largest city by population is [[Xiamen]], both located near the coast of the Taiwan Strait in the east of the province. The name Fujian came from the combination of [[Fuzhou]] and Jianzhou (present [[Nanping]]), a city in Fujian, during the [[Tang dynasty]].\n\nWhile its population is chiefly of ethnic Chinese origin, it is one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse provinces in China. Historically the dialects of the language group [[Min Chinese]] were most commonly spoken within the province, including the [[Hokkien]] dialects of southeastern Fujian. This is reflected in the abbreviation of the province's name ({{zh|labels=no|\u95fd}}). [[Hakka Chinese]] is also spoken, by the [[Hakka people]] in Fujian. Min dialects and Hakka Chinese are unintelligible with [[Mandarin Chinese]]. Due to emigration, a sizable amount of the ethnic Chinese populations of [[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Philippines]] speak [[Southern Min]] (or Hokkien).\n\nAs a result of the [[Chinese Civil War]], [[#History|Historical Fujian]] is now divided between the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC) and the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] (ROC, Taiwan), and both territories are named the Fujian province in their respective administration divisions. The majority of the territory of historical Fujian (the mainland territory and a few islands) currently make up the Fujian province of the PRC. The [[Fujian Province, Republic of China|Fujian province]] of the ROC is made up of the [[Matsu Islands]], the [[Wuqiu, Kinmen|Wuqiu Islands]] and the [[Kinmen|Kinmen Islands]], the two latter archipelagos constituting [[Kinmen County]].\n\nWith a population of 39 million, Fujian ranks [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by population|17th in population]] among Chinese provinces. Its GDP is CN\u00a53.58 trillion, [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP|ranking 10th in GDP]]. Along with its coastal neighbours Zhejiang and Guangdong, Fujian's GDP per capita is above the national average, at CN\u00a592,830. It has benefited from its geographical proximity with Taiwan.\n\n==History==\n===Prehistoric Fujian===\nRecent archaeological discoveries in 2011 demonstrate that Fujian had entered the [[Neolithic Age]] by the middle of the 6th millennium BC.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rolett, Barry V.; Zheng, Zhuo; Yue, Yuanfu|first=|date=April 2011|title=Holocene sea-level change and the emergence of Neolithic seafaring in the Fuzhou Basin (Fujian, China)|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011QSRv...30..788R|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|volume=30|pages=788\u2013797|via=|access-date=June 14, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830164625/http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011QSRv...30..788R|archive-date=August 30, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> From the Keqiutou site (7450\u20135590 BP), an early Neolithic site in [[Pingtan Island]] located about {{convert|70|km}} southeast of Fuzhou, numerous tools made of stones, [[Animal shell|shell]]s, [[bone]]s, [[jade]]s, and [[ceramic]]s (including wheel-made ceramics) have been unearthed, together with [[spinning wheel]]s, which is definitive evidence of [[weaving]].\n\nThe Tanshishan ({{lang|zh-hant|\u66c7\u77f3\u5c71}}) site (5500\u20134000 BP) in suburban Fuzhou spans the Neolithic and [[Chalcolithic]] Age where semi-underground circular buildings were found in the lower level. The Huangtulun ({{lang|zh-hant|\u9ec3\u571f\u5d19}}) site (ca.1325 BC), also in suburban Fuzhou, was of the [[Bronze Age]] in character.\n\nTianlong Jiao (2013)<ref name=\"Jiao2013\">Jiao, Tianlong. 2013. \"The Neolithic Archaeology of Southeast China.\" In Underhill, Anne P., et al. ''A Companion to Chinese Archaeology'', 599-611. Wiley-Blackwell.</ref> notes that the [[Neolithic]] appeared on the coast of Fujian around 6,000 B.P. During the Neolithic, the coast of Fujian had a low population density, with the population depending on mostly on fishing and hunting, along with limited agriculture.\n\nThere were four major Neolithic cultures in coastal Fujian, with the earliest Neolithic cultures originating from the north in coastal [[Zhejiang]].<ref name=\"Jiao2013\"/>\n*Keqiutou culture ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u58f3\u4e18\u5934\u6587\u5316}}; c. 6000\u20135500 BP, or c. 4050\u20133550 BC)\n*Tanshishan culture ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u6619\u77f3\u5c71\u6587\u5316}}; c. 5000\u20134300 BP, or c. 3050\u20132350 BC)\n*Damaoshan culture ({{zh|labels=no|c=\u5927\u5e3d\u5c71\u6587\u5316}}; c. 5000\u20134300 BP)\n*Huangguashan culture ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u9ec4\u74dc\u5c71\u6587\u5316}}; c. 4300\u20133500 BP, or c. 2350\u20131550 BC)\n\nThere were two major Neolithic cultures in inland Fujian, which were highly distinct from the coastal Fujian Neolithic cultures.<ref name=\"Jiao2013\"/> These are the Niubishan culture ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u725b\u9f3b\u5c71\u6587\u5316}}) from 5000\u20134000 years ago, and the Hulushan culture ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u846b\u82a6\u5c71\u6587\u5316}}) from 2050 to 1550 BC.\n\n===Minyue kingdom===\n\n{{Main|Minyue}}\nFujian was also where the kingdom of [[Minyue]] was located. The word \"M\u01d0nyu\u00e8\" was derived by combining \"M\u01d0n\" ({{zh|t=\u95a9 |s=\u95fd |poj=b\u00e2n}}), which is perhaps an ethnic name ({{zh|t=\u883b |s=\u86ee |p=m\u00e1n |poj=b\u00e2n |links=no}}), and \"[[Baiyue|Yu\u00e8]]\", after the [[State of Yue]], a [[Spring and Autumn period]] kingdom in [[Zhejiang]] to the north. This is because the royal family of Yu\u00e8 fled to Fujian after its kingdom was annexed by the [[State of Chu]] in 306 BC. M\u01d0n is also the name of the [[Min River (Fujian)|main river]] in this area, but the ethnonym is probably older.\n\n===Qin dynasty===\n[[Li Si]], the famous prime minister of Qin, deposed the king of Minyue, establishing instead a paramilitary province there called Minzhong Commandery.<ref>Brittanica</ref> Minyue was a ''de facto'' kingdom until one of the emperors of the [[Qin dynasty]], the first unified imperial Chinese state, abolished its status.\n\n===Han dynasty===\n{{see also|Han campaigns against Minyue}}\nIn the aftermath of the Qin dynasty's fall, [[Chu\u2013Han Contention|civil war]] broke out between two warlords, [[Xiang Yu]] and [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Liu Bang]]. The Minyue king Wuzhu sent his troops to fight with Liu and his gamble paid off. Liu was victorious and founded the [[Han dynasty]]. In 202 BC, he restored Minyue's status as a [[tributary state|tributary]] independent kingdom. Thus Wuzhu was allowed to construct his fortified city in [[Fuzhou]] as well as a few locations in the [[Wuyi Mountains]], which have been excavated in recent years. His kingdom extended beyond the borders of contemporary Fujian into eastern [[Guangdong]], eastern [[Jiangxi]], and southern [[Zhejiang]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20200222123322/https://global.britannica.com/place/Fujian#ref591270 Fuijan]. Britannica.com.</ref>\n\nAfter Wuzhu's death, Minyue maintained its militant tradition and launched several expeditions against its neighboring kingdoms in [[Guangdong]], [[Jiangxi]], and [[Zhejiang]], primarily in the 2nd century BC. This was stopped by the [[Han dynasty]] as it [[Southward expansion of the Han dynasty|expanded southward]]. The Han emperor eventually decided to get rid of the potential threat by launching a [[Han campaigns against Minyue|military campaign]] against Minyue. Large forces approached Minyue simultaneously from four directions via land and sea in 111 BC. The rulers in Fuzhou surrendered to avoid a futile fight and destruction and the first kingdom in Fujian history came to an abrupt end.\n\nFujian was part of the much larger [[Yang Province]] (Yangzhou), whose provincial capital was designated in Liyang (\u6b77\u967d; present-day [[He County, Anhui]]).\n\nThe [[Han dynasty]] collapsed at the end of the 2nd century AD, paving the way for the [[Three Kingdoms]] era. [[Sun Quan]], the founder of the [[Eastern Wu|Kingdom of Wu]], spent nearly 20 years subduing the Shan Yue people, the branch of the Yue living in mountains.\n\n===Jin era===\nThe first wave of [[Migration of the eight clans|immigration]] of the noble class arrived in the province in the early 4th century when the [[Western Jin dynasty]] collapsed and the north was torn apart by invasions by nomadic peoples from the north, as well as civil war. These immigrants were primarily from eight families in [[central China]]: {{cn-span|[[Lin (surname)|Lin]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|\u6797}}), [[Huang (surname)|Huang]] ({{linktext|lang=zh-Hans|\u9ec4}}), [[Chen (surname)|Chen]] ({{linktext|lang=zh-Hans|\u9648}}), [[Zheng (surname)|Zheng]] ({{linktext|lang=zh-Hans|\u90d1}}), [[Zhan (surname)|Zhan]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|\u8a79}}), [[Qi\u016b (surname)|Qiu]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|\u90b1}}, [[He (surname)|He]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|\u4f55}}, and [[Hu (surname)|Hu]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|\u80e1}}. The first four remain as the major surnames of modern Fujian.|date=April 2020}}\n\nNevertheless, isolation from nearby areas owing to rugged terrain contributed to Fujian's relatively undeveloped economy and level of development, despite major population boosts from northern China during the \"barbarian\" invasions. Population density in Fujian remained low compared to the rest of China. Only two [[Commandery (China)|commanderies]] and sixteen counties were established by the Western Jin dynasty. Like other southern provinces such as [[Guangdong]], [[Guangxi]], [[Guizhou]], and [[Yunnan]], Fujian often served as a destination for exiled prisoners and dissidents at that time.\n\nDuring the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] era, the [[Southern Dynasties]] ([[Liu Song dynasty|Liu Song]], [[Southern Qi]], [[Liang dynasty|Liang]] ([[Western Liang (555\u2013587)|Western Liang]]), and [[Chen dynasty|Chen]]) reigned south of the [[Yangtze River]], including Fujian.\n\n===Sui and Tang dynasties===\n{{see also|Early western influence in Fujian}}\nDuring the [[Sui Dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] eras a large influx of migrants settled in Fujian.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AIKTj-KgN40C&pg=PA41#v=onepage&q&f=fatutilse | title=The Pan-Pearl River Delta: An Emerging Regional Economy in a Globalizing China | page=41}}</ref>\n\nThe Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) oversaw the next golden age of China, which contributed to a boom in Fujian's culture and economy. [[Fuzhou]]'s economic and cultural institutions grew and developed. The later years of the Tang dynasty saw a number of political upheavals in the Chinese heartland, prompting even larger waves of northerners to immigrate to northern part of Fujian.\n\n===Five Dynasties Ten Kingdoms===\nAs the Tang dynasty ended, China was torn apart in the period of the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms]].

Danxia [[landform]] is formed from red-coloured [[sandstone]]s and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]] of largely [[Cretaceous]] age. The landforms look very much like [[karst]] topography that forms in areas underlain by [[limestone]]s, but since the rocks that form danxia are sandstones and conglomerates, they have been called \"pseudo-karst\" landforms.

Fujian is bordered by [[Zhejiang]] to the north, [[Jiangxi]] to the west, [[Guangdong]] to the south, and the [[Taiwan Strait]] to the east. Its capital is [[Fuzhou]], while its largest city by population is [[Xiamen]], both located near the coast of the Taiwan Strait in the east of the province. The name Fujian came from the combination of [[Fuzhou]] and Jianzhou (present [[Nanping]]), a city in Fujian, during the [[Tang dynasty]].\n\nWhile its population is chiefly of ethnic Chinese origin, it is one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse provinces in China. Historically the dialects of the language group [[Min Chinese]] were most commonly spoken within the province, including the [[Hokkien]] dialects of southeastern Fujian. This is reflected in the abbreviation of the province's name ({{zh|labels=no|\u95fd}}). [[Hakka Chinese]] is also spoken, by the [[Hakka people]] in Fujian. Min dialects and Hakka Chinese are unintelligible with [[Mandarin Chinese]]. Due to emigration, a sizable amount of the ethnic Chinese populations of [[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Philippines]] speak [[Southern Min]] (or Hokkien).\n\nAs a result of the [[Chinese Civil War]], [[#History|Historical Fujian]] is now divided between the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC) and the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] (ROC, Taiwan), and both territories are named the Fujian province in their respective administration divisions. The majority of the territory of historical Fujian (the mainland territory and a few islands) currently make up the Fujian province of the PRC. The [[Fujian Province, Republic of China|Fujian province]] of the ROC is made up of the [[Matsu Islands]], the [[Wuqiu, Kinmen|Wuqiu Islands]] and the [[Kinmen|Kinmen Islands]], the two latter archipelagos constituting [[Kinmen County]].\n\nWith a population of 39 million, Fujian ranks [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by population|17th in population]] among Chinese provinces. Its GDP is CN\u00a53.58 trillion, [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP|ranking 10th in GDP]]. Along with its coastal neighbours Zhejiang and Guangdong, Fujian's GDP per capita is above the national average, at CN\u00a592,830. It has benefited from its geographical proximity with Taiwan.\n\n==History==\n===Prehistoric Fujian===\nRecent archaeological discoveries in 2011 demonstrate that Fujian had entered the [[Neolithic Age]] by the middle of the 6th millennium BC.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rolett, Barry V.; Zheng, Zhuo; Yue, Yuanfu|first=|date=April 2011|title=Holocene sea-level change and the emergence of Neolithic seafaring in the Fuzhou Basin (Fujian, China)|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011QSRv...30..788R|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|volume=30|pages=788\u2013797|via=|access-date=June 14, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830164625/http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011QSRv...30..788R|archive-date=August 30, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> From the Keqiutou site (7450\u20135590 BP), an early Neolithic site in [[Pingtan Island]] located about {{convert|70|km}} southeast of Fuzhou, numerous tools made of stones, [[Animal shell|shell]]s, [[bone]]s, [[jade]]s, and [[ceramic]]s (including wheel-made ceramics) have been unearthed, together with [[spinning wheel]]s, which is definitive evidence of [[weaving]].\n\nThe Tanshishan ({{lang|zh-hant|\u66c7\u77f3\u5c71}}) site (5500\u20134000 BP) in suburban Fuzhou spans the Neolithic and [[Chalcolithic]] Age where semi-underground circular buildings were found in the lower level. The Huangtulun ({{lang|zh-hant|\u9ec3\u571f\u5d19}}) site (ca.1325 BC), also in suburban Fuzhou, was of the [[Bronze Age]] in character.\n\nTianlong Jiao (2013)<ref name=\"Jiao2013\">Jiao, Tianlong. 2013. \"The Neolithic Archaeology of Southeast China.\" In Underhill, Anne P., et al. ''A Companion to Chinese Archaeology'', 599-611. Wiley-Blackwell.</ref> notes that the [[Neolithic]] appeared on the coast of Fujian around 6,000 B.P. During the Neolithic, the coast of Fujian had a low population density, with the population depending on mostly on fishing and hunting, along with limited agriculture.\n\nThere were four major Neolithic cultures in coastal Fujian, with the earliest Neolithic cultures originating from the north in coastal [[Zhejiang]].<ref name=\"Jiao2013\"/>\n*Keqiutou culture ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u58f3\u4e18\u5934\u6587\u5316}}; c. 6000\u20135500 BP, or c. 4050\u20133550 BC)\n*Tanshishan culture ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u6619\u77f3\u5c71\u6587\u5316}}; c. 5000\u20134300 BP, or c. 3050\u20132350 BC)\n*Damaoshan culture ({{zh|labels=no|c=\u5927\u5e3d\u5c71\u6587\u5316}}; c. 5000\u20134300 BP)\n*Huangguashan culture ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u9ec4\u74dc\u5c71\u6587\u5316}}; c. 4300\u20133500 BP, or c. 2350\u20131550 BC)\n\nThere were two major Neolithic cultures in inland Fujian, which were highly distinct from the coastal Fujian Neolithic cultures.<ref name=\"Jiao2013\"/> These are the Niubishan culture ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u725b\u9f3b\u5c71\u6587\u5316}}) from 5000\u20134000 years ago, and the Hulushan culture ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u846b\u82a6\u5c71\u6587\u5316}}) from 2050 to 1550 BC.\n\n===Minyue kingdom===\n\n{{Main|Minyue}}\nFujian was also where the kingdom of [[Minyue]] was located. The word \"M\u01d0nyu\u00e8\" was derived by combining \"M\u01d0n\" ({{zh|t=\u95a9 |s=\u95fd |poj=b\u00e2n}}), which is perhaps an ethnic name ({{zh|t=\u883b |s=\u86ee |p=m\u00e1n |poj=b\u00e2n |links=no}}), and \"[[Baiyue|Yu\u00e8]]\", after the [[State of Yue]], a [[Spring and Autumn period]] kingdom in [[Zhejiang]] to the north. This is because the royal family of Yu\u00e8 fled to Fujian after its kingdom was annexed by the [[State of Chu]] in 306 BC. M\u01d0n is also the name of the [[Min River (Fujian)|main river]] in this area, but the ethnonym is probably older.\n\n===Qin dynasty===\n[[Li Si]], the famous prime minister of Qin, deposed the king of Minyue, establishing instead a paramilitary province there called Minzhong Commandery.<ref>Brittanica</ref> Minyue was a ''de facto'' kingdom until one of the emperors of the [[Qin dynasty]], the first unified imperial Chinese state, abolished its status.\n\n===Han dynasty===\n{{see also|Han campaigns against Minyue}}\nIn the aftermath of the Qin dynasty's fall, [[Chu\u2013Han Contention|civil war]] broke out between two warlords, [[Xiang Yu]] and [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Liu Bang]]. The Minyue king Wuzhu sent his troops to fight with Liu and his gamble paid off. Liu was victorious and founded the [[Han dynasty]]. In 202 BC, he restored Minyue's status as a [[tributary state|tributary]] independent kingdom. Thus Wuzhu was allowed to construct his fortified city in [[Fuzhou]] as well as a few locations in the [[Wuyi Mountains]], which have been excavated in recent years. His kingdom extended beyond the borders of contemporary Fujian into eastern [[Guangdong]], eastern [[Jiangxi]], and southern [[Zhejiang]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20200222123322/https://global.britannica.com/place/Fujian#ref591270 Fuijan]. Britannica.com.</ref>\n\nAfter Wuzhu's death, Minyue maintained its militant tradition and launched several expeditions against its neighboring kingdoms in [[Guangdong]], [[Jiangxi]], and [[Zhejiang]], primarily in the 2nd century BC. This was stopped by the [[Han dynasty]] as it [[Southward expansion of the Han dynasty|expanded southward]]. The Han emperor eventually decided to get rid of the potential threat by launching a [[Han campaigns against Minyue|military campaign]] against Minyue. Large forces approached Minyue simultaneously from four directions via land and sea in 111 BC. The rulers in Fuzhou surrendered to avoid a futile fight and destruction and the first kingdom in Fujian history came to an abrupt end.\n\nFujian was part of the much larger [[Yang Province]] (Yangzhou), whose provincial capital was designated in Liyang (\u6b77\u967d; present-day [[He County, Anhui]]).\n\nThe [[Han dynasty]] collapsed at the end of the 2nd century AD, paving the way for the [[Three Kingdoms]] era. [[Sun Quan]], the founder of the [[Eastern Wu|Kingdom of Wu]], spent nearly 20 years subduing the Shan Yue people, the branch of the Yue living in mountains.\n\n===Jin era===\nThe first wave of [[Migration of the eight clans|immigration]] of the noble class arrived in the province in the early 4th century when the [[Western Jin dynasty]] collapsed and the north was torn apart by invasions by nomadic peoples from the north, as well as civil war. These immigrants were primarily from eight families in [[central China]]: {{cn-span|[[Lin (surname)|Lin]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|\u6797}}), [[Huang (surname)|Huang]] ({{linktext|lang=zh-Hans|\u9ec4}}), [[Chen (surname)|Chen]] ({{linktext|lang=zh-Hans|\u9648}}), [[Zheng (surname)|Zheng]] ({{linktext|lang=zh-Hans|\u90d1}}), [[Zhan (surname)|Zhan]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|\u8a79}}), [[Qi\u016b (surname)|Qiu]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|\u90b1}}, [[He (surname)|He]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|\u4f55}}, and [[Hu (surname)|Hu]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|\u80e1}}. The first four remain as the major surnames of modern Fujian.|date=April 2020}}\n\nNevertheless, isolation from nearby areas owing to rugged terrain contributed to Fujian's relatively undeveloped economy and level of development, despite major population boosts from northern China during the \"barbarian\" invasions. Population density in Fujian remained low compared to the rest of China. Only two [[Commandery (China)|commanderies]] and sixteen counties were established by the Western Jin dynasty. Like other southern provinces such as [[Guangdong]], [[Guangxi]], [[Guizhou]], and [[Yunnan]], Fujian often served as a destination for exiled prisoners and dissidents at that time.\n\nDuring the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] era, the [[Southern Dynasties]] ([[Liu Song dynasty|Liu Song]], [[Southern Qi]], [[Liang dynasty|Liang]] ([[Western Liang (555\u2013587)|Western Liang]]), and [[Chen dynasty|Chen]]) reigned south of the [[Yangtze River]], including Fujian.\n\n===Sui and Tang dynasties===\n{{see also|Early western influence in Fujian}}\nDuring the [[Sui Dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] eras a large influx of migrants settled in Fujian.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AIKTj-KgN40C&pg=PA41#v=onepage&q&f=fatutilse | title=The Pan-Pearl River Delta: An Emerging Regional Economy in a Globalizing China | page=41}}</ref>\n\nThe Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) oversaw the next golden age of China, which contributed to a boom in Fujian's culture and economy. [[Fuzhou]]'s economic and cultural institutions grew and developed. The later years of the Tang dynasty saw a number of political upheavals in the Chinese heartland, prompting even larger waves of northerners to immigrate to northern part of Fujian.\n\n===Five Dynasties Ten Kingdoms===\nAs the Tang dynasty ended, China was torn apart in the period of the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms]]. During this time, a second major wave of immigration arrived in the safe haven of Fujian, led by General Wang, who set up an independent [[Min (Ten Kingdoms)|Kingdom of Min]] with its capital in Fuzhou.

It is famous as a natural landscape garden and a summer resort in China.\n\nThe [[Fujian Tulou]] are Chinese rural dwellings unique to the Hakka in southwest Fujian. They were listed by the [[UNESCO]] as one of the [[World Heritage Site]]s in 2008.\n\n[[Gulangyu Island]], [[Xiamen]], is notable for its beaches, winding lanes and rich architecture. The island is on China's list of National Scenic Spots and is classified as a [[Tourist Attraction Rating Categories of China|5A tourist attraction]] by the [[China National Tourism Administration]] (CNTA).

It is a unique type of [[Petrography|petrographic]] [[geomorphology]]<nowiki/>found in [[China]]. Danxia [[landform]] is formed from red-coloured [[sandstone]]s and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]] of largely [[Cretaceous]] age. The landforms look very much like [[karst]] topography that forms in areas underlain by [[limestone]]s, but since the rocks that form danxia are sandstones and conglomerates, they have been called \"pseudo-karst\" landforms. They were formed by endogenous forces (including [[Tectonic uplift|uplift]]) and exogenous forces (including [[weathering]] and [[erosion]])\n\n==Notable individuals==\nThe province and its diaspora abroad also has a tradition of educational achievement and has produced many important scholars, statesmen and other notable people since the time of the [[Song dynasty]], such as:\n*[[Cai Jing]] (1047\u20131126), government official and calligrapher who lived during the Northern Song dynasty\n*[[Li Gang (Song dynasty)|Li Gang]] (1083\u20131140), a politician and general serving during the transition from the Northern Song to the Southern Song dynasty\n*[[Zhu Xi]] (1130\u20131200), Confucian philosopher\n*[[Ong Sum Ping]] (14th\u201315th century), royal son-in-law of Sultan [[Muhammad Shah of Brunei]]\n*[[Yu Dayou]] (1503\u20131579), Ming dynasty general and martial artist\n*[[Ingen]] (1592\u20131673), well known Buddhist monk, poet and calligrapher who lived during Ming Dynasty\n*[[Hong Chengchou]] (1593\u20131665), Ming dynasty official\n*[[Shi Lang]] (1621\u20131696), Qing dynasty admiral\n*[[Koxinga]] (1624\u20131662), Ming dynasty general who expelled the Dutch from Taiwan\n*[[Lin Zexu]] (1785\u20131850), Qing dynasty scholar and official\n*[[Zhan Shi Chai]] (1840s\u20131893), entertainer as \"Chang the Chinese giant\"\n*[[Wong Nai Siong]] (1849\u20131924), scholar, revolutionary, discovered the town of [[Sibu]] in [[Sarawak]], east [[Malaysia]] in 1901\n*[[Lin Shu]] (1852\u20131924), translator\n*[[Yan Fu]] (1854\u20131921), scholar and translator\n*[[Sa Zhenbing]] (1859\u20131952), high-ranking naval officer of [[Mongols|Mongolian]] origin\n*[[Zheng Xiaoxu]] (1860\u20131938), statesman, diplomat and calligrapher\n*Lin Changmin([[:zh:\u6797\u9577\u6c11]]) (1876\u20141925), a high-rank governor in the Beiyang Government\n*[[Lin Juemin]] (1887\u20131911), one of 72 [[Second Guangzhou Uprising|Revolutionary Martyrs]] at Huanghuagang, Guangzhou\n*[[Lin Yutang]] (1894\u20131976), writer\n*[[Zheng Zhenduo]] (1898\u20131958), literary historian\n*[[Ong Schan Tchow]] ({{zh|c=[[:zh:\u7fc1\u5360\u79cb|\u7fc1\u5360\u79cb]]}}) (1900\u20131945), artist well known for the painting of the \u201cBook of Chrysanthemums\u201d\n*[[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]] (1861\u20131896), National Hero of the [[Philippines]] whose lineage is from Fujian\n*[[Lin Huiyin]] (1904\u20131955), architect and writer\n*Tsai Chi-Kun (1912\u20132004), \"father of the Taiwan Symphony\"\n*[[Go Seigen]] (1914\u20132014), [[pseudonym]] of [[Go (board game)|Go]] champion W\u00fa Q\u012bngyu\u00e1n\n*[[Sudono Salim|Liem Sioe Liong]] (1916\u20132012), a Chinese-born Indonesian businessman of [[Fuqing]] origin, founder of [[Salim Group]]\n*[[Lin Dan]] (born 1983), professional badminton player\n*[[Jeremy Lin]] (born 1988), professional basketball player\n*[[Qian Kun]] (born 1996), singer, member/leader of boy group [[WayV]]\n\n==Sports==\nFujian includes professional sports teams in both the [[Chinese Basketball Association]] and the [[China League One|Chinese League One]].\n\nThe representative of the province in the [[Chinese Basketball Association]] are the [[Fujian Sturgeons]], who are based in [[Jinjiang, Fujian|Jinjiang]], [[Quanzhou]].

Bouma was a technically refined left back or centre back known for his hard working nature, defensive positioning and tackling ability.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Early career===\nBorn in [[Helmond]], [[North Brabant]], Bouma started his career at amateur club SV Rood-Wit '62 before joining [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] on a youth contract in 1994. The PSV head coach at the time, [[Aad de Mos]] handed him his professional debut against [[Willem II (football club)|Willem II]] on 26 October 1994 which his team lost 2\u20131. After not featuring for a long time, he was loaned out to [[MVV]] in 1996 and played in the [[Eerste Divisie]] where he scored seven goals in 18 games. The following season, he scored sixteen goals in 33 games after helping his team back into the [[Eredivisie]]. After impressing at [[Fortuna Sittard]] in 1998\u201399, he was drafted back into the PSV squad the following season.\n\n===PSV===\nAt PSV, he played as a left winger and as forward because of his quick pace and direct passing, teaming up with [[Arnold Jan Bruggink|Arnold Bruggink]] and at times, with [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]].\n\nWhen [[Arthur Numan]] departed to [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] at the end of the 1999\u201300 season, Bouma was moved to left-back where he had to compete with Danish international [[Jan Heintze]].\n\nWith the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] qualifiers entering its crucial stages, Bouma was handed his international debut for the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national team]] against the [[Republic of Ireland]] on 2 September 2000. In the [[2004 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2004]] tournament in Portugal, he was chosen by [[Dick Advocaat]] to play as a central defender and he has also retained that spot while playing for PSV under [[Guus Hiddink]] in the 2004\u201305 season.\n\n===Aston Villa===\n[[File:Wilfred Bouma Chelsea v. Aston Villa 1.png|thumb|100px|Bouma before an [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] game in 2007]]\nJust before the close of the international [[transfer window]], Bouma signed for [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] on 30 August 2005 for \u00a33.5&nbsp;million.<ref>{{Cite news| title = Villa land Dutch defender Bouma| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/4194370.stm| publisher=BBC Sport| date = 30 August 2005| accessdate = 12 April 2008}}</ref> He struggled to establish himself during the 2005\u201306 campaign at [[Villa Park]], as his debut season was heavily tarnished with injuries. However, when [[Martin O'Neill]] replaced boss [[David O'Leary]], Bouma \u2013 after recovering from a hamstring injury \u2013 replaced stand-in left-back [[Gareth Barry]].\n\nUnder O'Neill, Bouma begun to flourish during the [[2006\u201307 Aston Villa F.C. season|2006\u201307 season]] \u2013 he established himself as first choice left back and went on to total 28 appearances in the claret and blue shirt. This led to Bouma becoming a cult hero at Villa Park, most notably for his strong tackling, and determined nature in defence. This turn in form also attributed to Bouma reclaiming his place in the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch National Team]], playing in the friendly against [[Russia national football team|Russia]] in February 2007, the tour of Asia in June 2007 and the following [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying]] fixtures.\n\nOn 9 February 2008, Bouma \u2013 who was in the process of making his 76th appearance in claret and blue \u2013 netted his only goal for the club in the 48th minute of the match against [[Newcastle United]]. The deflected goal levelled the game at 1\u20131, before a hat-trick by teammate [[John Carew]], wrapped up a 4\u20131 victory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7223963.stm|title=Aston Villa 4\u20131 Newcastle|publisher=BBC|date=9 February 2008|accessdate=2 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nUpon returning from international duty for [[Netherlands national football team|the Netherlands]] at [[Euro 2008]], Bouma participated in both legs of Aston Villa's [[2008 UEFA Intertoto Cup|Intertoto Cup]] third round tie against [[Odense BK|Odense]], however the second leg at Villa Park on 26 July 2008 was marred by a serious ankle injury to the full-back. Bouma caught his studs on the turf as he attempted to challenge opposition forward [[Baye Djiby Fall]]. Initially, the injury looked like a horrific break, however reports later confirmed that Bouma had suffered a dislocation, an injury which looked set to keep him out until October. His recovery however took much longer. Bouma's increasing importance to the Villa cause, as well as his 'cult-hero status' was noted as he was carried off early in the tie whilst being accompanied by a 30,000 strong chant of support by the Villa faithful.<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aston_villa/7527180.stm|title = Horror injury for Villa's Bouma |publisher=BBC|date=26 July 2008 |accessdate=16 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 September 2008, Bouma signed a new two-year deal at Villa Park with the option of a third year.\n\nIn January 2009 it was announced that Bouma, along with other long-term absentee [[John Carew]] had returned to full training. He was scheduled to return on 16 February for the reserves but he pulled out at the last minute because he \"felt sore\". On 2 March 2009, Bouma finally played 90 minutes in a 4\u20133 win in a reserve match against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. However, he suffered a setback on his road to recovery in April after learning bone fragments had broken away from his ankle, and underwent surgery soon after.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aston_villa/8004750.stm|title = Ankle injury ends Bouma's season|publisher=BBC|date=17 April 2009 |accessdate=16 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 September 2009, after being out of action for fourteen months, it was announced that Bouma had resumed full training with the club.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aston_villa/8259666.stm|title=Bouma resumes training for Villa|publisher=BBC|date=16 September 2009 |accessdate=16 September 2009}}</ref> However, Bouma's injury worries were not yet over.

As of July 2008, Wilfred Bouma has played for the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] 35 times, scoring twice. Bouma made his debut on 2 September 2000, in the 2\u20132 draw with the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]]. Several steady appearances followed in the coming years, including 4 appearances at [[Euro 2004]], whilst playing as a centre-back.

is a Dutch former [[association football|footballer]] who played most notably for [[PSV Eindhoven]], [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands national team]]. Bouma was a technically refined left back or centre back known for his hard working nature, defensive positioning and tackling ability.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Early career===\nBorn in [[Helmond]], [[North Brabant]], Bouma started his career at amateur club SV Rood-Wit '62 before joining [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] on a youth contract in 1994. The PSV head coach at the time, [[Aad de Mos]] handed him his professional debut against [[Willem II (football club)|Willem II]] on 26 October 1994 which his team lost 2\u20131. After not featuring for a long time, he was loaned out to [[MVV]] in 1996 and played in the [[Eerste Divisie]] where he scored seven goals in 18 games. The following season, he scored sixteen goals in 33 games after helping his team back into the [[Eredivisie]]. After impressing at [[Fortuna Sittard]] in 1998\u201399, he was drafted back into the PSV squad the following season.\n\n===PSV===\nAt PSV, he played as a left winger and as forward because of his quick pace and direct passing, teaming up with [[Arnold Jan Bruggink|Arnold Bruggink]] and at times, with [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]].\n\nWhen [[Arthur Numan]] departed to [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] at the end of the 1999\u201300 season, Bouma was moved to left-back where he had to compete with Danish international [[Jan Heintze]].\n\nWith the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] qualifiers entering its crucial stages, Bouma was handed his international debut for the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national team]] against the [[Republic of Ireland]] on 2 September 2000. In the [[2004 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2004]] tournament in Portugal, he was chosen by [[Dick Advocaat]] to play as a central defender and he has also retained that spot while playing for PSV under [[Guus Hiddink]] in the 2004\u201305 season.\n\n===Aston Villa===\n[[File:Wilfred Bouma Chelsea v. Aston Villa 1.png|thumb|100px|Bouma before an [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] game in 2007]]\nJust before the close of the international [[transfer window]], Bouma signed for [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] on 30 August 2005 for \u00a33.5&nbsp;million.<ref>{{Cite news| title = Villa land Dutch defender Bouma| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/4194370.stm| publisher=BBC Sport| date = 30 August 2005| accessdate = 12 April 2008}}</ref> He struggled to establish himself during the 2005\u201306 campaign at [[Villa Park]], as his debut season was heavily tarnished with injuries. However, when [[Martin O'Neill]] replaced boss [[David O'Leary]], Bouma \u2013 after recovering from a hamstring injury \u2013 replaced stand-in left-back [[Gareth Barry]].\n\nUnder O'Neill, Bouma begun to flourish during the [[2006\u201307 Aston Villa F.C. season|2006\u201307 season]] \u2013 he established himself as first choice left back and went on to total 28 appearances in the claret and blue shirt. This led to Bouma becoming a cult hero at Villa Park, most notably for his strong tackling, and determined nature in defence. This turn in form also attributed to Bouma reclaiming his place in the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch National Team]], playing in the friendly against [[Russia national football team|Russia]] in February 2007, the tour of Asia in June 2007 and the following [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying]] fixtures.\n\nOn 9 February 2008, Bouma \u2013 who was in the process of making his 76th appearance in claret and blue \u2013 netted his only goal for the club in the 48th minute of the match against [[Newcastle United]]. The deflected goal levelled the game at 1\u20131, before a hat-trick by teammate [[John Carew]], wrapped up a 4\u20131 victory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7223963.stm|title=Aston Villa 4\u20131 Newcastle|publisher=BBC|date=9 February 2008|accessdate=2 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nUpon returning from international duty for [[Netherlands national football team|the Netherlands]] at [[Euro 2008]], Bouma participated in both legs of Aston Villa's [[2008 UEFA Intertoto Cup|Intertoto Cup]] third round tie against [[Odense BK|Odense]], however the second leg at Villa Park on 26 July 2008 was marred by a serious ankle injury to the full-back. Bouma caught his studs on the turf as he attempted to challenge opposition forward [[Baye Djiby Fall]]. Initially, the injury looked like a horrific break, however reports later confirmed that Bouma had suffered a dislocation, an injury which looked set to keep him out until October. His recovery however took much longer. Bouma's increasing importance to the Villa cause, as well as his 'cult-hero status' was noted as he was carried off early in the tie whilst being accompanied by a 30,000 strong chant of support by the Villa faithful.<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aston_villa/7527180.stm|title = Horror injury for Villa's Bouma |publisher=BBC|date=26 July 2008 |accessdate=16 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 September 2008, Bouma signed a new two-year deal at Villa Park with the option of a third year.\n\nIn January 2009 it was announced that Bouma, along with other long-term absentee [[John Carew]] had returned to full training. He was scheduled to return on 16 February for the reserves but he pulled out at the last minute because he \"felt sore\". On 2 March 2009, Bouma finally played 90 minutes in a 4\u20133 win in a reserve match against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. However, he suffered a setback on his road to recovery in April after learning bone fragments had broken away from his ankle, and underwent surgery soon after.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aston_villa/8004750.stm|title = Ankle injury ends Bouma's season|publisher=BBC|date=17 April 2009 |accessdate=16 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 September 2009, after being out of action for fourteen months, it was announced that Bouma had resumed full training with the club.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aston_villa/8259666.stm|title=Bouma resumes training for Villa|publisher=BBC|date=16 September 2009 |accessdate=16 September 2009}}</ref> However, Bouma's injury worries were not yet over.

As of July 2008, Wilfred Bouma has played for the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] 35 times, scoring twice. Bouma made his debut on 2 September 2000, in the 2\u20132 draw with the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]]. Several steady appearances followed in the coming years, including 4 appearances at [[Euro 2004]], whilst playing as a centre-back. Bouma was included in the Dutch squad for [[Euro 2008]], and he made 2 appearances, coming on as a 78th substitute against [[France national football team|France]] and playing the full 90 minutes against [[Romania national football team|Romania]].

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

On October 13, 1972, while crossing the Andes, the inexperienced co-pilot of the [[Fairchild F-27|Fairchild FH-227D]] who was in command mistakenly believed they had reached [[Curic\u00f3]], Chile, despite [[Instrument Flight Rules|instrument readings]] that indicated otherwise. The aircraft began descending too early to reach [[Comodoro Arturo Merino Ben\u00edtez International Airport|Pudahuel Airport]], and subsequently crashed into a mountain, shearing off both wings and the tail section. The remainder of the aircraft slid downwards and came to rest on a [[glacier]]. The flight was carrying 45 passengers and crew, including 19 members of the [[Old Christians Club]] [[rugby union]] team, along with their families, supporters, and friends.\n\nThe wreck was located in the remote [[Andes|Andes Mountains]] in far western [[Argentina]], near the border with Chile. The broken fuselage came to rest at an elevation of {{convert|3570|m}}. Three crew members and more than a quarter of the passengers died in the crash, and several others soon died due to the frigid temperatures and their serious injuries. Authorities immediately began searching for the aircraft, and flew over the crash site several times, but could not see the white fuselage against the snow. Search efforts were canceled after eight days.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Uruguayan-Air-Force-flight-571|title=Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571|first=Amy|last=Tikkanen|accessdate=March 12, 2020}}</ref> During the next 72 days, 13 more passengers died. The remaining survivors reluctantly resorted to [[Human cannibalism|cannibalism]]. Nando Parrado and Roberto Canessa climbed a {{convert|4650|m}} mountain peak without gear and hiked for 10 days into Chile. On December 23, 1972, 72 days after the crash, 16 survivors were rescued.\n\nThe incident was later known as the '''Andes flight disaster''' and, in the Hispanic world, as ''El Milagro de los Andes'' ('''The Miracle of the Andes''').\n\n== Flight and accident ==\n=== Flight origins ===\n[[File:The tinguiririca volcano seen from the tinguiririca river valley chile vi region.jpg|thumb|The Tinguiririca volcano seen from the [[Tinguiririca River]] valley]]\n\nMembers of the amateur [[Old Christians Club]] [[rugby union]] team from [[Montevideo]], Uruguay, were scheduled to play a match against the Old Boys Club, an English rugby team  in [[Santiago, Chile]].<ref name=quigley/> Club president Daniel Juan chartered a [[Uruguayan Air Force]] twin [[turboprop]] [[Fairchild FH-227]]D to fly the team over the [[Andes]] to Santiago. The aircraft carried 40 passengers and 5 crew members. Colonel Julio C\u00e9sar Ferradas was an experienced Air Force pilot who had a total of 5,117 flying hours. He was accompanied by co-pilot Lieutenant-Colonel Dante H\u00e9ctor Lagurara. There were 10 extra seats and the team members invited a few friends and family members to accompany them. When someone cancelled at the last minute, Graziela Mariani bought the seat so she could attend her oldest daughter's wedding.<ref name=quigley/>\n\nThe aircraft departed [[Carrasco International Airport]] on 12 October 1972, but a storm front over the Andes forced them to stop overnight in [[Mendoza, Argentina]]. Although there is a direct route from Mendoza to Santiago {{convert|200|km}} to the west, the high mountains require an altitude of {{convert|25000|to|26000|ft}}, very close to the FH-227D's maximum operational ceiling of {{convert|28000|ft}}. Given that the FH-227 aircraft was fully loaded, this route would have required the pilot to very carefully calculate fuel consumption and to avoid the mountains. Instead, it was customary for this type of aircraft to fly a longer {{convert|600|km|mi|adj=on}}, 90-minute U-shaped route<ref name=quigley>{{cite book |last1=Quigley |first1=Christine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZMSSCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA225&lpg=PA225 |title=Modern Mummies: The Preservation of the Human Body in the Twentieth Century |ISBN=9781476613734 | publisher = McFarland |date=September 2015 |pages=225\u2013232}}</ref> from Mendoza south to Malarg\u00fce using the A7 airway (known today as UW44).

On that  morning, conditions over the Andes had not improved but changes were expected by the early afternoon. The pilot waited and took off at 2:18 PM on Friday 13 October from Mendoza. He flew south from Mendoza towards Malarg\u00fce radiobeacon at flight level 180 (FL180, {{convert|18000|ft}}). Lagurara radioed the Malarg\u00fce airport with their position and told them they would reach {{convert|2515|m}} high Planch\u00f3n Pass at 3:21 PM. The pass is the hand-off point for air traffic control from one side of the Andes to the other. At the pass, controllers in Mendoza transfer flight tracking to Pudahuel air traffic control in Santiago, Chile.<ref name=\"astheaccident\" /><ref>[http://www.dangerousroads.org/south-america/chile/4314-paso-del-planch\u00f3n.html Paso del Planch\u00f3n]</ref> Once across the mountains in Chile, south of Curic\u00f3, the aircraft was supposed to turn north and initiate a descent into [[Comodoro Arturo Merino Ben\u00edtez International Airport|Pudahuel Airport]] in Santiago.\n\n=== The crash ===\n\nPilot Ferradas had flown across the Andes 29 times previously. On this flight he was training co-pilot Lagurara, who was the pilot in command. As they flew through the Andes, clouds obscured the mountains.<ref name=safety/><ref name=\"caputti\"/> The aircraft, FAU 571, was four years old and had 792 airframe hours.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Calcagno |first1=Ernesto Blanco |title=The Ghost of FAU 571 |url=https://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/above-beyond-ghost-of-fau-571-180957783/ |website=Air & Space Magazine |accessdate=11 September 2018 |language=en}}</ref> The aircraft was regarded by some pilots as underpowered, and had been nicknamed by them as the \"lead-sled.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Peck |first1=Rand |title=One Airline Career: I'm Alive: by AMS Pictures |url=http://randpeck.blogspot.com/2010/03/im-alive-by-ams-pictures.html |website=One Airline Career |accessdate=11 September 2018 |date=8 March 2010}}</ref><ref name=taringa>{{cite web |title=40 a\u00f1os de la tragedia de los andes - \u00bb Militares en Taringa +11.200  Taringa|url=https://www.taringa.net/comunidades/militares-en-t/6238720/40-anos-de-la-tragedia-de-los-andes.html |accessdate=11 September 2018 |language=es}}</ref>\n\nGiven the cloud cover, the pilots were flying under [[instrument meteorological conditions]] at an altitude of {{convert|18000|ft}} (FL180), and could not visually confirm their location. While some reports state the pilot incorrectly estimated his position using [[dead reckoning]], the pilot was relying on radio navigation.<ref name=taringa/> The aircraft's [[VOR/DME]] instrument displayed to the pilot a digital reading of the distance to the next radio beacon in Curic\u00f3. At Planch\u00f3n Pass, the aircraft still had to travel {{convert|60|\u2013|70|km|abbr=on}} to reach Curic\u00f3. Inexplicably, at 3:21 PM, shortly after transiting the pass, Lagurara contacted Santiago and notified air traffic controllers that he expected to reach Curic\u00f3 a minute later. The flight time from the pass to Curic\u00f3 is normally eleven minutes, but only three minutes later the pilot told Santiago that they were passing Curic\u00f3 and turning north. He requested permission from air traffic control to descend. The controller in Santiago, unaware the flight was still over the Andes, authorized him to descend to {{convert|11500|ft}} (FL115).<ref name=safety/><ref name=taringa/> Later analysis of their flight path found the pilot had not only turned too early, but turned on a heading of 014 degrees, when he should have turned to 030 degrees.<ref name=\"caputti\"/>\n\nAs the aircraft descended, severe turbulence tossed the aircraft up and down. Nando Parrado recalled hitting a downdraft, causing the plane to drop several hundred feet and out of the clouds. The rugby players joked about the turbulence at first, until some passengers saw that the aircraft was very close to the mountain. \"That was probably the moment when the pilots saw the black ridge rising dead ahead.\"<ref>{{cite web |first1= Nando |last1=Parrado |title=Nando Parrado on his survival of the 1972 Andes air crash |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/may/18/extract.features11 |website=The Guardian |accessdate=18 June 2018 |language=en |date=18 May 2006 }}</ref>\n\nRoberto Canessa later said he thought the pilot turned north too soon, and began the descent to Santiago while the aircraft was still high in the Andes. Then, \"he began to climb, until the plane was nearly vertical and it began to stall and shake.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3455568/Die-break-ultimate-taboo-Survivor-s-moving-account-Andes-plane-crash-victims-forced-eat-friends-bodies-story-haunts-world-40-years-on.html|title=1972 Andes plane crash survivor shares moving account of survival|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20161223135629/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3455568/Die-break-ultimate-taboo-Survivor-s-moving-account-Andes-plane-crash-victims-forced-eat-friends-bodies-story-haunts-world-40-years-on.html|archivedate=23 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The aircraft [[airborne collision avoidance system|ground collision alarm]] sounded, alarming all of the passengers.<ref name=tragedia/>\n\nThe pilot applied maximum power in an attempt to gain altitude.

The pilot was able to bring the aircraft nose over the ridge but at 3:34&nbsp;pm, the lower part of the tail cone may have clipped the ridge at {{convert|4200|m}}. The next collision severed the right wing. Some evidence indicates it was thrown back with such force that it tore off the [[vertical stabilizer]] and the tail cone. When the tail cone was detached, it took with it the rear portion of the fuselage, including two rows of seats in the rear section of the passenger cabin, the galley, baggage hold, vertical stabilizer, and [[Stabilizer (aeronautics)|horizontal stabilizers]], leaving a gaping hole in the rear of the [[fuselage]]. Three passengers, the navigator, and the steward were lost with the tail section.<ref name=\"caputti\"/><ref name=quigley/>\n\nThe aircraft continued forward and upward another {{convert|200|meters}} for a few more seconds when the left wing struck an outcropping at {{convert|4,400|meters}}, tearing off the wing. One of the propellers sliced through the fuselage as the wing it was attached to was severed.<ref name=\"caputti\"/> Two more passengers fell out of the open rear of the fuselage. The front portion of the fuselage flew straight through the air before sliding down the steep slope at {{convert|350|km/h|abbr=on}} like a high-speed toboggan for about {{convert|725|m}} before colliding with a snow bank.

The aircraft was {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of its planned route.<ref name=\"caputti\"/>\n\n== Passenger survival ==\n\nOf the 45 people on the aircraft, three passengers and two crew members in the tail section were killed when it broke apart: Lt. Ram\u00f3n Sa\u00fal Mart\u00ednez, Orvido Ram\u00edrez (plane steward), Gaston Costemalle, Alejo Houni\u00e9, and Guido Magri. A few seconds later, Daniel Shaw and Carlos Valeta fell out of the rear fuselage. Valeta survived his fall, but stumbled down the snow-covered glacier, fell into deep snow, and was asphyxiated.<ref name=quigley/> His body was found by fellow passengers on 14 December.<ref name=vlahos/><ref name=true/>\n\nAt least four died from the impact of the fuselage hitting the snow bank, which ripped the remaining seats from their anchors and hurled them to the front of the plane: team physician Dr. Francisco Nicola and his wife Esther Nicola; Eugenia Parrado and Fernando Vazquez (medical student). Pilot Ferradas died instantly when the nose gear compressed the instrument panel against his chest, forcing his head out the window; co-pilot Lagurara was critically injured and trapped in the crushed cockpit.<ref name=quigley/> He asked one of the passengers to find his pistol and shoot him, but the passenger declined.<ref name=\"tragedia\"/>\n\nThirty-three remained alive, although many were seriously or critically injured, with wounds including broken legs which had resulted from the aircraft's seats collapsing forward against the luggage partition and the pilot's cabin.<ref name=true>{{cite web|url=https://survivallife.com/true-survival-stories-andes-miracle/|title=True Survival Stories: Miracle In The Andes - Survival Life|date=12 October 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614165043/https://survivallife.com/true-survival-stories-andes-miracle/|archivedate=14 June 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nGustavo Zerbino and Roberto Canessa, both second-year medical students, acted quickly to assess the severity of people's wounds and treat those they could help most. Nando Parrado had a skull fracture and remained in a [[coma]] for three days. Enrique Platero had a piece of metal stuck in his abdomen that when removed brought a few inches of intestine with it, but he immediately began helping others. Both of Arturo Nogueira's legs were broken in several places. None of the passengers with [[compound fracture]]s survived.<ref name=live/>\n\n===Search and rescue===\n[[File:Hotel_El_Sosneado.jpg|thumb|The abandoned summer resort Hotel Termas was, unknown to the survivors, about {{convert|21|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of their crash location.]]\nThe Chilean Air Search and Rescue Service (SARS) was notified within the hour that the flight was missing. Four planes searched that afternoon until dark. The news of the missing flight reached Uruguayan media about 6:00 PM that evening. Officers of the Chilean SARS listened to the radio transmissions and concluded the aircraft had come down in one of the  most remote and inaccessible areas of the Andes. They called on the Andes Rescue Group of Chile (CSA). Unknown to the people on board or the rescuers, the flight had crashed about {{convert|21|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Hotel Termas, an abandoned resort and hot springs that might have provided limited shelter.<ref name=quigley/>\n\nOn the second day, eleven aircraft from Argentina, Chile and Uruguay searched for the downed flight.<ref name=quigley/> The search area included their location and a few aircraft flew near the crash site. The survivors tried to use lipstick recovered from the luggage to write an [[SOS]] on the roof of the aircraft, but they quit after realizing they lacked enough lipstick to make letters visible from the air. They saw three aircraft fly overhead, but were unable to attract their attention, and none of the aircraft spotted the white fuselage against the snow. The harsh conditions gave searchers little hope they would find anyone alive. Search efforts were cancelled after eight days.<ref name=live/> On 21 October, after searching a total of 142 hours and 30 minutes, the searchers concluded there was no hope and terminated the search. They hoped to find the bodies in the summer (December in Southern Hemisphere) when the snow melted.\n\nThe survivors found a small [[transistor radio]] jammed between seats on the aircraft, and Roy Harley improvised a very long antenna using electrical cable from the plane.<ref name=tragedia>{{cite web |title=La tragedia de los Andes |url=http://www.enlacesuruguayos.com/Tragedia.htm |website=La tragedia de los Andes |accessdate=17 July 2018 |language=es}}</ref> He heard the news that the search was cancelled on their 11th day on the mountain. [[Piers Paul Read]]'s book ''[[Alive: The Story of the Andes Survivors]]'' described the moments after this discovery:\n\n{{cquote|The others who had clustered around Roy, upon hearing the news, began to sob and pray, all except [Nando] Parrado, who looked calmly up at the mountains which rose to the west.

'Hey boys,' he shouted, 'there's some good news! We just heard on the radio. They've called off the search.' Inside the crowded aircraft there was silence. As the hopelessness of their predicament enveloped them, they wept. 'Why the hell is that good news?' Paez shouted angrily at Nicolich. 'Because it means,' [Nicolich] said, 'that we're going to get out of here on our own.' The courage of this one boy prevented a flood of total despair.<ref name=piers>{{cite book|author=[[Piers Paul Read|Read, Piers Paul]] |title=Alive: The Story of the Andes Survivors|pages=88\u20139|edition=First}}</ref>}}\n\n===First week ===\n\nDuring the first night, five more people died: co-pilot Lagurara, Francisco Abal, Graziela Mariani, Felipe Maquirriain, and Julio Martinez-Lamas.\n\nThe passengers removed the broken seats and other debris from the aircraft and fashioned a crude shelter. The 27 people crammed themselves into the broken fuselage in a space about {{convert|2.5|x|3|m}}. To try to keep out some of the cold, they used luggage, seats, and snow to close off the open end of the fuselage. They improvised in other ways. Fito Strauch devised a way to obtain water in freezing conditions by using sheet metal from under the seats and placing snow on it. The solar collector melted snow which  dripped into empty wine bottles. To prevent [[snow blindness]], he improvised sunglasses using the sun visors in the pilot's cabin, wire, and a bra strap. They removed the seat covers which were partially made of wool and used them to keep warm. They used the seat cushions as snow shoes. Marcelo Perez, captain of the rugby team, assumed leadership.<ref name=vlahos/><ref name=live/>\n\nNando Parrado woke from his coma after three days to learn his 19-year-old sister Susana Parrado was severely injured. He attempted to keep her alive without success, and during the eighth day she succumbed to her injuries.<ref name=true/> The remaining 27 faced severe difficulties surviving the nights when temperatures dropped to {{convert|-30|C}}.<ref name=paez>{{cite web |last1=P\u00e1ez |first1=Carlitos |title=Allie Se Siente la Prescensia de Dios |url=http://blogs.montevideo.com.uy:80/bloghome_18745_1_1.html |accessdate=18 June 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304115322/http://blogs.montevideo.com.uy/bloghome_18745_1_1.html |archivedate=4 March 2011 |language=es |date=12 December 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> All had lived near the sea; most of the team members had never seen snow before, and none had experience at high altitude. The survivors lacked medical supplies, cold-weather clothing and equipment or food, and only had three pairs of sunglasses among them to help prevent snow blindness.\n\n===Turn to cannibalism===\n\nThe survivors had extremely little food: eight chocolate bars, a tin of mussels, three small jars of jam, a tin of almonds, a few dates, candies, dried plums, and several bottles of wine. During the days following the crash, they divided this into very small amounts to make their meager supply last as long as possible. Parrado ate a single chocolate-covered peanut over three days.<ref name=live/><ref name=quigley/>\n\nEven with this strict rationing, their food stock dwindled quickly. There were no natural vegetation or animals on the glacier or nearby snow-covered mountain. The food ran out after a week, and the group tried to eat parts of the airplane like the cotton inside the seats and leather. They got sicker from eating these.<ref name=live/>\n\nOn the tenth day after the crash, the survivors learned from a transistor radio that the search had been called off. Faced with starvation and death, those still alive agreed that should they die, the others might consume their bodies in order to live. With no choice, the survivors ate the bodies of their dead friends.<ref name=vlahos>Vlahos, James  [http://www.alpineexpeditions.net/national-geographic-expedition-ii.html Return to the Andes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613111606/http://www.alpineexpeditions.net/national-geographic-expedition-ii.html |date=13 June 2018 }} 17 July 2006</ref><ref name=live/> \n\nSurvivor Roberto Canessa described the decision to eat the pilots and their dead friends and family members:\n\n{{cquote|Our common goal was to survive \u2014 but what we lacked was food. We had long since run out of the meagre pickings we\u2019d found on the plane, and there was no vegetation or animal life to be found. After just a few days, we were feeling the sensation of our own bodies consuming themselves just to remain alive. Before long, we would become too weak to recover from starvation.\n\nWe knew the answer, but it was too terrible to contemplate.\n\nThe bodies of our friends and team-mates, preserved outside in the snow and ice, contained vital, life-giving protein that could help us survive. But could we do it?\n\nFor a long time, we agonised. I went out in the snow and prayed to God for guidance. Without His consent, I felt I would be violating the memory of my friends; that I would be stealing their souls.\n\nWe wondered whether we were going mad even to contemplate such a thing. Had we turned into brute savages? Or was this the only sane thing to do? Truly, we were pushing the limits of our fear.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/cannibalism-andes-plane-crash-1972-survivors-terrible-decision-stay-alive-a6895781.html|title=Plane crash survivor describes the moment he resorted to cannibalism|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171123062437/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/cannibalism-andes-plane-crash-1972-survivors-terrible-decision-stay-alive-a6895781.html| archivedate=23 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> }}\n\nThe group survived by collectively deciding to eat flesh from the bodies of their dead comrades. This decision was not taken lightly, as most of the dead were classmates, close friends, or relatives. Canessa used broken glass from the aircraft windshield as a cutting tool. He set the example by swallowing the first matchstick-sized strip of frozen flesh. Several others did the same later on. The next day more survivors ate the meat offered them, but a few refused or could not keep it down.<ref name=quigley/>\n\nIn his memoir, ''[[Miracle in the Andes: 72 Days on the Mountain and My Long Trek Home]]'' (2006), [[Nando Parrado]] wrote about this decision:\n\n{{cquote|At high altitude, the body's caloric needs are astronomical&nbsp;... we were starving in earnest, with no hope of finding food, but our hunger soon grew so voracious that we searched anyway&nbsp;... again and again, we scoured the fuselage in search of crumbs and morsels. We tried to eat strips of leather torn from pieces of luggage, though we knew that the chemicals they'd been treated with would do us more harm than good. We ripped open seat cushions hoping to find straw, but found only inedible upholstery foam&nbsp;... Again and again, I came to the same conclusion: unless we wanted to eat the clothes we were wearing, there was nothing here but aluminum, plastic, ice, and rock.<ref name=parrado/>{{rp|94\u201395}} }}\n\nParrado protected the corpses of his sister and mother, and they were never eaten. They dried the meat in the sun, which made it more palatable. They were initially so revolted by the experience that they could eat only skin, muscle and fat. When the supply of flesh was diminished, they also ate hearts, lungs and even brains.<ref name=parrado/>\n\nAll of the passengers were [[Roman Catholic]]. Some feared eternal [[damnation]]. According to Read, some rationalized the act of necrotic [[cannibalism]] as equivalent to [[Eucharist|the Eucharist]], the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ under the appearances of bread and wine. Others justified it according to a Bible verse found in [[John 15#Verse 13|John 15:13]]: \u2018No man hath greater love than this: that he lay down his life for his friends.\u2019\n\nSome initially had reservations, though after realizing that it was their only means of staying alive, they changed their minds a few days later. Javier Methol and his wife Liliana, the only surviving female passenger, were the last survivors to eat human flesh. She had strong religious convictions, and only reluctantly agreed to partake of the flesh after she was told to view it as \"a kind of Holy Communion\".<ref name=munger/>\n\n===Avalanche===\nSeventeen days after the crash, near midnight on 29 October, an avalanche struck the aircraft containing the survivors as they slept. It filled the fuselage and killed eight people: Enrique Platero, Liliana Methol, Gustavo Nicolich, Daniel Maspons, Juan Menendez, Diego Storm, Carlos Roque, and Marcelo Perez. The deaths of Perez, the team captain and leader of the survivors, and Liliana Methol, who had nursed the survivors \"like a mother and a saint\", were extremely discouraging to those remaining alive.<ref name=true/><ref name=munger>{{cite web |title=An iron cross in the mountains: The lonely site of the 1972 Andes flight disaster. |url=https://seanmunger.com/2014/10/13/an-iron-cross-in-the-mountains-the-lonely-site-of-the-1972-andes-flight-disaster/ |website=SeanMunger.com |accessdate=14 June 2018 |date=13 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe avalanche completely buried the fuselage and filled the interior to within {{convert|1|m}} of the roof. The survivors trapped inside soon realized they were running out of air. Nando Parrado found a metal pole from the luggage racks and was able to poke a hole in the fuselage roof, providing ventilation. With considerable difficulty, on the morning of 31 October they dug a tunnel from the cockpit to the surface, only to encounter a furious blizzard that left them no choice but to stay inside the fuselage.\n\nFor three days the survivors were trapped in the extremely cramped space within the buried fuselage with about {{convert|1|m}} headroom, together with the corpses of those who had died in the avalanche. With no other choice, on the third day they resorted to eating the flesh of their newly dead friends.<ref name=true/><ref name=live/>\n\nWith Perez dead, cousins Eduardo and Fito Strauch and Daniel Fern\u00e1ndez assumed leadership. They took over harvesting flesh from their deceased friends and distributing it to the others.<ref name=vlahos/>\n\nBefore the avalanche, a few of the survivors became insistent that their only way of survival would be to climb over the mountains and search for help. Because of the co-pilot's dying statement that the aircraft had passed Curic\u00f3, the group believed the Chilean countryside was just a few kilometres away to the west. They were actually more than {{convert|89|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the east, deep in the Andes. The snow that had buried the fuselage gradually melted as summer arrived. Survivors made several brief expeditions in the immediate vicinity of the aircraft in the first few weeks after the crash, but they found that altitude sickness, dehydration, snow blindness, malnourishment, and the extreme cold during the nights made traveling any significant distance an impossible task.<ref name=safety>{{cite web |title=When dead reckoning became deadly: remembering the Andes air disaster {{!}} Flight Safety Australia |url=http://www.flightsafetyaustralia.com/2017/10/when-dead-reckoning-became-deadly-remembering-the-andes-air-disaster/ |website=Flight Safety Australia |accessdate=20 June 2018 |date=13 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Expedition explores area ===\n\nThe passengers decided that a few members would seek help. Several survivors were determined to join the expedition team, including Roberto Canessa, one of the two medical students, but others were less willing or unsure of their ability to withstand such a physically exhausting ordeal. Numa Turcatti and Antonio Vizintin were chosen to accompany Canessa and Parrado. They were allocated the largest rations of food and the warmest clothes. They were also spared the daily manual labor around the crash site that was essential for the group's survival, so they could build their strength. At Canessa's urging, they waited nearly seven days to allow for higher temperatures.\n\nThey hoped to get to Chile to the west, but a large mountain lay west of the crash site, persuading them to try heading east first. They hoped that the valley they were in would make a U-turn and allow them to start walking west. On 15 November, after several hours walking east, the trio found the largely intact tail section of the aircraft containing the galley about {{convert|1|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} east and downhill of the fuselage. Inside and nearby they found luggage containing a box of chocolates, three meat patties, a bottle of rum, cigarettes, extra clothes, comic books, and a little medicine. They also found the aircraft's two-way radio. The group decided to camp that night inside the tail section. They built a fire and stayed up late reading comic books.<ref name=vlahos/>\n\nThey continued east the next morning. On the second night of the expedition, which was their first night sleeping outside, they nearly froze to death. After some debate the next morning, they decided that it would be wiser to return to the tail, remove the aircraft's batteries, and bring them back to the fuselage so they might power up the radio and make an SOS call to Santiago for help.<ref name=live/>\n\n===Radio inoperative ===\n\nUpon returning to the tail, the trio found that the {{convert|24|kg|adj=on}} batteries were too heavy to take back to the fuselage, which lay uphill from the tail section. They decided instead that it would be more effective to return to the fuselage and disconnect the radio system from the aircraft's frame, take it back to the tail, and connect it to the batteries. One of the team members, Roy Harley, was an amateur electronics enthusiast, and they recruited his help in the endeavour. Unknown to any of the team members, the aircraft's electrical system used 115 volts [[alternating current|AC]], while the battery they had located produced 24 volts [[direct current|DC]],<ref name=tragedia/> making the plan futile from the beginning.\n\nAfter several days of trying to make the radio work, they gave up and returned to the fuselage with the knowledge that they would have to climb out of the mountains if they were to have any hope of being rescued. On the return trip they were struck by a blizzard. Harley lay down to die, but Parrado would not let him stop and took him back to the fuselage.\n\n===Three more deaths ===\n\nOn 15 November, Arturo Nogueira died, and three days later, Rafael Echavarren died, both from [[gangrene]] due to their infected wounds.  Numa Turcatti, who would not eat human flesh, died on day 60 (11 December) weighing only {{convert|55|lbs}}. Those left knew they would inevitably die if they did not find help.<ref name=live/><!--<ref name=docvideo>https://youtu.be/oS-30JuTW2I ''I am Alive: Surviving the Andes Plane Crash'' (documentary video)</ref> --> The survivors heard on the transistor radio that the Uruguayan Air Force had resumed searching for them.<ref name=historia/>\n\n==Rescue trek==\n\n===Planning===\nThey decided that a few of the strongest people would hike out to seek rescue.<ref name=live/> Sixty days after the crash, passengers [[Nando Parrado]] and [[Roberto Canessa]], lacking [[mountaineering]] gear of any kind, climbed from the glacier at {{convert|3570|m}} to the {{convert|4670|m}} peak blocking their way west.

They also realized that unless they found a way to survive the freezing temperature of the nights, a trek was impossible. The survivors who had found the tail came up with an idea to use insulation from the rear of the fuselage, copper wire, and waterproof fabric that covered the air conditioning of the plane to fashion a sleeping bag.<ref name=paez/><ref name=live/>\n\nNando Parrado described in his book, ''Miracle in the Andes: 72 Days on the Mountain and My Long Trek Home'', how they came up with the idea of making a sleeping bag: \n{{cquote|The second challenge would be to protect ourselves from exposure, especially after sundown. At this time of year, we could expect daytime temperatures well above freezing, but the nights were still cold enough to kill us, and we knew now that we couldn't expect to find shelter on the open slopes.\n\nWe needed a way to survive the long nights without freezing, and the quilted batts of insulation we'd taken from the tail section gave us our solution&nbsp;... as we brainstormed about the trip, we realized we could sew the patches together to create a large warm quilt. Then we realized that by folding the quilt in half and stitching the seams together, we could create an insulated sleeping bag large enough for all three expeditionaries to sleep in. With the warmth of three bodies trapped by the insulating cloth, we might be able to weather the coldest nights.\n\nCarlitos [P\u00e1ez] took on the challenge. His mother had taught him to sew when he was a boy, and with the needles and thread from the sewing kit found in his mother's cosmetic case, he began to work&nbsp;... to speed the progress, Carlitos taught others to sew, and we all took our turns&nbsp;... Coche [Inciarte], Gustavo [Zerbino], and Fito [Strauch] turned out to be our best and fastest tailors.<ref name=parrado>{{cite book|year=2006|authorlink=Nando Parrado |last1=Parrado |first1=Nando|last2= Rause |first2= Vince |title=[[Miracle in the Andes: 72 Days on the Mountain and My Long Trek Home]] |isbn= 978-0756988470 }}</ref>}}\n\nAfter the sleeping bag was completed and Numa Turcatti died, Canessa was still hesitant. While others encouraged Parrado, none would volunteer to go with him. Parrado finally persuaded Canessa to set out, and joined by Vizint\u00edn, the three men took to the mountain on 12 December.<ref name=live>{{cite web|url= http://survivaltolive.blogspot.com/2014/02/i-will-not-die-on-this-mountain.html|title=Survival|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180911231531/http://survivaltolive.blogspot.com/2014/02/i-will-not-die-on-this-mountain.html |first1=Bondan |last1=Stymulan  |archivedate=11 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Climbing the peak ===\n\n[[File:Crash site.JPG|right|thumb|View of peak to the west that the three men climbed. The Crash Site Memorial in the foreground was created after the survivors' rescue.]]\nOn 12 December 1972, two months after the crash, Parrado, Canessa, and Vizint\u00edn began to climb the mountain to their west. Based on the aircraft's altimeter, they thought they were at {{convert|7000|ft}}, when they were actually at about {{convert|11800|ft|0}}. Given the pilot's dying statement that they were near Curic\u00f3, they believed that they were near the western edge of the Andes. As a result, they brought only a three-day supply of meat.<ref name=historia/>\n\nParrado wore three pairs of jeans and three sweaters over a polo shirt. He wore four pairs of socks wrapped in a plastic shopping bag. They had no technical gear, no map or compass, and no climbing experience. Instead of climbing the saddle to the west that is {{convert|1670|m}} lower than the peak, they climbed straight up the steep mountain.<ref name=home/> They thought they would reach the peak in one day. Parrado took the lead and the other two often had to remind him to slow down, although the thin [[oxygen]] made it difficult for all of them. During part of the climb, they sank up to their hips in the snow, which had been softened by the summer sun.<ref name=live/>\n\nIt was still bitterly cold, but the sleeping bag allowed them to live through the nights. In the film ''[[Stranded: I've Come from a Plane that Crashed in the Mountains|Stranded]]'', Canessa described how on the first night during the ascent, they had difficulty finding a place to put down the sleeping bag. A storm blew fiercely, and they finally found a spot on a ledge of rock, on the edge of an abyss. Canessa said it was the worst night of his life. The climb was very slow; the survivors at the fuselage watched them climb for three days. On the second day, Canessa thought he saw a road to the east, and tried to persuade Parrado to head in that direction. Parrado disagreed and they argued without reaching a decision.<ref name=historia/>\n\nOn the third morning of the trek, Canessa stayed at their camp. Vizint\u00edn and Parrado reached the base of a near-vertical wall more than one hundred meters (300 feet) tall encased in snow and ice. Parrado was determined to hike out or die trying. He used a stick from his pack to carve steps in the wall. He gained the summit of the {{convert|4650|m}} high peak before Vizint\u00edn. Thinking he would see the green valleys of Chile to the west, he was stunned to see a vast array of mountain peaks in every direction. They had climbed a mountain on the border of Argentina and Chile, meaning the trekkers were still tens of kilometres from the green valleys of Chile. Vizint\u00edn and Parrado rejoined Canessa where they had slept the night before. At sunset, sipping cognac they had found in the tail section, Parrado said, \"Roberto, can you imagine how beautiful this would be if we were not dead men?\"<ref name=home/> The next morning, the three men could see that the hike was going to take much longer than they had originally planned. They were running out of food, so Vizint\u00edn agreed to return to the crash site. The return was entirely downhill, and using an aircraft seat as a makeshift [[sleigh]], he returned to the crash site in one hour.<ref name=historia/>\n\nParrado and Canessa took three hours to climb to the summit. When Canessa reached the top and saw nothing but snow-capped mountains for kilometres around them, his first thought was, \"We're dead.\"<ref name=live/> Parrado saw two smaller peaks on the western horizon that were not covered in snow. A valley at the base of the mountain they stood on wound its way towards the peaks. Parrado was sure this was their way out of the mountains. He refused to give up hope. Canessa agreed to go west. Only much later did Canessa learn that the trail he saw would have gotten them to rescue.<ref name=home>{{cite web|url=https://www.outsideonline.com/1824341/long-way-home|title=The Long Way Home - Outside Online|date=1 May 2006|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Connelly |first1=Sherryl |title=Survivor of 1972 Andes plane crash who resorted to cannibalism reveals struggle in new book, 'I Had to Survive' - NY Daily News |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/andes-crash-survivor-ate-friends-tells-new-book-article-1.2538568 |website=nydailynews.com |accessdate=14 June 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171112130258/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/andes-crash-survivor-ate-friends-tells-new-book-article-1.2538568 |archivedate=12 November 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn the summit, Parrado told Canessa, \"We may be walking to our deaths, but I would rather walk to meet my death than wait for it to come to me.\" Canessa agreed. \"You and I are friends, Nando.

First, they were able to reach the narrow valley that Parrado had seen on the top of the mountain, where they found the source of R\u00edo San Jos\u00e9, leading to R\u00edo Portillo which meets R\u00edo Azufre at Maitenes. They followed the river and reached the [[snowline]].<ref name=live/><ref name=historia/>\n\nGradually, there appeared more and more signs of human presence; first some evidence of camping, and finally on the ninth day, some cows.

Parrado called to them, but the noise of the river made it impossible to communicate. One of the men across the river saw Parrado and Canessa and called back, \"Tomorrow!\" The next day, the man returned. He scribbled a note, attached it and a pencil to a rock with some string, and threw the message across the river. Parrado replied:<ref name=live/><ref name=historia/>\n\n{{Cquote|Spanish: {{lang|es|Vengo de un avi\u00f3n que cay\u00f3 en las monta\u00f1as. Soy uruguayo. Hace 10 d\u00edas que estamos caminando.

Catal\u00e1n talked with the other two men, and one of them remembered that several weeks before Carlos Paez's father had asked them if they had heard about the Andes plane crash. The ''arrieros'' could not imagine that anyone could still be alive. Catal\u00e1n threw bread to the men across the river. He then rode on horseback westward for ten hours to bring help.<ref name=live/><ref name=historia/>\n\nDuring the trip he saw another ''arriero'' on the south side of R\u00edo Azufre, and asked him to reach the men and to bring them to Los Maitenes.

The reporters clamored to interview Parrado and Canessa about the crash and their survival ordeal.<ref name=tragedia/>\n\nThe Chilean army provided three [[Bell UH-1N Twin Huey|Bell UH-1]] helicopters to assist with the rescue. They flew in heavy cloud cover under instrument conditions to Los Maitenes de Curic\u00f3 where the army interviewed Parrado and Canessa. When the fog lifted at about noon, Parrado volunteered to lead the helicopters to the crash site. He had brought the pilot's flight chart and guided the helicopters up the mountain to the location of the remaining survivors. One helicopter remained behind in reserve. The pilots were astounded at the difficult terrain the two men had crossed to reach help.<ref name=tragedia/>\n\nOn the afternoon of 22 December 1972, the two helicopters carrying search and rescue personnel reached the survivors. The steep terrain only permitted the pilot to touch down with a single skid. Due to the altitude and weight limits, the two helicopters were able to take only half of the survivors. Four members of the search and rescue team volunteered to stay with the seven survivors remaining on the mountain.<ref name=tragedia/>\n\nThe survivors slept a final night in the fuselage with the search and rescue party. The second flight of helicopters arrived the following morning at daybreak. They carried the remaining survivors to hospitals in Santiago for evaluation. They were treated for a variety of conditions, including [[altitude sickness]], [[dehydration]], [[frostbite]], [[Bone fracture|broken bones]], [[scurvy]], and [[malnutrition]].<ref name=tragedia/>\n\nUnder normal circumstances, the search and rescue team would have brought back the remains of the dead for burial. However, given the circumstances, including that the bodies were in Argentina, the Chilean rescuers left the bodies at the site until authorities could make the necessary decisions.

I was also shaken by the sensationalism with which many in the press covered the matter of what we had eaten to survive. Shortly after our rescue, officials of the Catholic Church announced that according to church doctrine we had committed no sin by eating the flesh of the dead. As Roberto had argued on the mountain, they told the world that the sin would have been to allow ourselves to die. More satisfying for me was the fact that many of the parents of the boys who died had publicly expressed their support for us, telling the world they understood and accepted what we had done to survive... despite these gestures, many news reports focused on the matter of our diet, in reckless and exploitive ways.

On October 13, 1972, while crossing the Andes, the inexperienced co-pilot of the [[Fairchild F-27|Fairchild FH-227D]] who was in command mistakenly believed they had reached [[Curic\u00f3]], Chile, despite [[Instrument Flight Rules|instrument readings]] that indicated otherwise. The aircraft began descending too early to reach [[Comodoro Arturo Merino Ben\u00edtez International Airport|Pudahuel Airport]], and subsequently crashed into a mountain, shearing off both wings and the tail section. The remainder of the aircraft slid downwards and came to rest on a [[glacier]]. The flight was carrying 45 passengers and crew, including 19 members of the [[Old Christians Club]] [[rugby union]] team, along with their families, supporters, and friends.\n\nThe wreck was located in the remote [[Andes|Andes Mountains]] in far western [[Argentina]], near the border with Chile. The broken fuselage came to rest at an elevation of {{convert|3570|m}}. Three crew members and more than a quarter of the passengers died in the crash, and several others soon died due to the frigid temperatures and their serious injuries. Authorities immediately began searching for the aircraft, and flew over the crash site several times, but could not see the white fuselage against the snow. Search efforts were canceled after eight days.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Uruguayan-Air-Force-flight-571|title=Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571|first=Amy|last=Tikkanen|accessdate=March 12, 2020}}</ref> During the next 72 days, 13 more passengers died. The remaining survivors reluctantly resorted to [[Human cannibalism|cannibalism]]. Nando Parrado and Roberto Canessa climbed a {{convert|4650|m}} mountain peak without gear and hiked for 10 days into Chile. On December 23, 1972, 72 days after the crash, 16 survivors were rescued.\n\nThe incident was later known as the '''Andes flight disaster''' and, in the Hispanic world, as ''El Milagro de los Andes'' ('''The Miracle of the Andes''').\n\n== Flight and accident ==\n=== Flight origins ===\n[[File:The tinguiririca volcano seen from the tinguiririca river valley chile vi region.jpg|thumb|The Tinguiririca volcano seen from the [[Tinguiririca River]] valley]]\n\nMembers of the amateur [[Old Christians Club]] [[rugby union]] team from [[Montevideo]], Uruguay, were scheduled to play a match against the Old Boys Club, an English rugby team  in [[Santiago, Chile]].<ref name=quigley/> Club president Daniel Juan chartered a [[Uruguayan Air Force]] twin [[turboprop]] [[Fairchild FH-227]]D to fly the team over the [[Andes]] to Santiago. The aircraft carried 40 passengers and 5 crew members. Colonel Julio C\u00e9sar Ferradas was an experienced Air Force pilot who had a total of 5,117 flying hours. He was accompanied by co-pilot Lieutenant-Colonel Dante H\u00e9ctor Lagurara. There were 10 extra seats and the team members invited a few friends and family members to accompany them. When someone cancelled at the last minute, Graziela Mariani bought the seat so she could attend her oldest daughter's wedding.<ref name=quigley/>\n\nThe aircraft departed [[Carrasco International Airport]] on 12 October 1972, but a storm front over the Andes forced them to stop overnight in [[Mendoza, Argentina]]. Although there is a direct route from Mendoza to Santiago {{convert|200|km}} to the west, the high mountains require an altitude of {{convert|25000|to|26000|ft}}, very close to the FH-227D's maximum operational ceiling of {{convert|28000|ft}}. Given that the FH-227 aircraft was fully loaded, this route would have required the pilot to very carefully calculate fuel consumption and to avoid the mountains. Instead, it was customary for this type of aircraft to fly a longer {{convert|600|km|mi|adj=on}}, 90-minute U-shaped route<ref name=quigley>{{cite book |last1=Quigley |first1=Christine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZMSSCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA225&lpg=PA225 |title=Modern Mummies: The Preservation of the Human Body in the Twentieth Century |ISBN=9781476613734 | publisher = McFarland |date=September 2015 |pages=225\u2013232}}</ref> from Mendoza south to Malarg\u00fce using the A7 airway (known today as UW44).

On that  morning, conditions over the Andes had not improved but changes were expected by the early afternoon. The pilot waited and took off at 2:18 PM on Friday 13 October from Mendoza. He flew south from Mendoza towards Malarg\u00fce radiobeacon at flight level 180 (FL180, {{convert|18000|ft}}). Lagurara radioed the Malarg\u00fce airport with their position and told them they would reach {{convert|2515|m}} high Planch\u00f3n Pass at 3:21 PM. The pass is the hand-off point for air traffic control from one side of the Andes to the other. At the pass, controllers in Mendoza transfer flight tracking to Pudahuel air traffic control in Santiago, Chile.<ref name=\"astheaccident\" /><ref>[http://www.dangerousroads.org/south-america/chile/4314-paso-del-planch\u00f3n.html Paso del Planch\u00f3n]</ref> Once across the mountains in Chile, south of Curic\u00f3, the aircraft was supposed to turn north and initiate a descent into [[Comodoro Arturo Merino Ben\u00edtez International Airport|Pudahuel Airport]] in Santiago.\n\n=== The crash ===\n\nPilot Ferradas had flown across the Andes 29 times previously. On this flight he was training co-pilot Lagurara, who was the pilot in command.

While some reports state the pilot incorrectly estimated his position using [[dead reckoning]], the pilot was relying on radio navigation.<ref name=taringa/> The aircraft's [[VOR/DME]] instrument displayed to the pilot a digital reading of the distance to the next radio beacon in Curic\u00f3. At Planch\u00f3n Pass, the aircraft still had to travel {{convert|60|\u2013|70|km|abbr=on}} to reach Curic\u00f3. Inexplicably, at 3:21 PM, shortly after transiting the pass, Lagurara contacted Santiago and notified air traffic controllers that he expected to reach Curic\u00f3 a minute later. The flight time from the pass to Curic\u00f3 is normally eleven minutes, but only three minutes later the pilot told Santiago that they were passing Curic\u00f3 and turning north. He requested permission from air traffic control to descend. The controller in Santiago, unaware the flight was still over the Andes, authorized him to descend to {{convert|11500|ft}} (FL115).<ref name=safety/><ref name=taringa/> Later analysis of their flight path found the pilot had not only turned too early, but turned on a heading of 014 degrees, when he should have turned to 030 degrees.<ref name=\"caputti\"/>\n\nAs the aircraft descended, severe turbulence tossed the aircraft up and down. Nando Parrado recalled hitting a downdraft, causing the plane to drop several hundred feet and out of the clouds. The rugby players joked about the turbulence at first, until some passengers saw that the aircraft was very close to the mountain. \"That was probably the moment when the pilots saw the black ridge rising dead ahead.\"<ref>{{cite web |first1= Nando |last1=Parrado |title=Nando Parrado on his survival of the 1972 Andes air crash |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/may/18/extract.features11 |website=The Guardian |accessdate=18 June 2018 |language=en |date=18 May 2006 }}</ref>\n\nRoberto Canessa later said he thought the pilot turned north too soon, and began the descent to Santiago while the aircraft was still high in the Andes.

The pilot was able to bring the aircraft nose over the ridge but at 3:34&nbsp;pm, the lower part of the tail cone may have clipped the ridge at {{convert|4200|m}}. The next collision severed the right wing. Some evidence indicates it was thrown back with such force that it tore off the [[vertical stabilizer]] and the tail cone. When the tail cone was detached, it took with it the rear portion of the fuselage, including two rows of seats in the rear section of the passenger cabin, the galley, baggage hold, vertical stabilizer, and [[Stabilizer (aeronautics)|horizontal stabilizers]], leaving a gaping hole in the rear of the [[fuselage]]. Three passengers, the navigator, and the steward were lost with the tail section.<ref name=\"caputti\"/><ref name=quigley/>\n\nThe aircraft continued forward and upward another {{convert|200|meters}} for a few more seconds when the left wing struck an outcropping at {{convert|4,400|meters}}, tearing off the wing.

The survivors tried to use lipstick recovered from the luggage to write an [[SOS]] on the roof of the aircraft, but they quit after realizing they lacked enough lipstick to make letters visible from the air. They saw three aircraft fly overhead, but were unable to attract their attention, and none of the aircraft spotted the white fuselage against the snow. The harsh conditions gave searchers little hope they would find anyone alive.

'Hey boys,' he shouted, 'there's some good news! We just heard on the radio. They've called off the search.' Inside the crowded aircraft there was silence. As the hopelessness of their predicament enveloped them, they wept. 'Why the hell is that good news?' Paez shouted angrily at Nicolich.

The 27 people crammed themselves into the broken fuselage in a space about {{convert|2.5|x|3|m}}. To try to keep out some of the cold, they used luggage, seats, and snow to close off the open end of the fuselage. They improvised in other ways. Fito Strauch devised a way to obtain water in freezing conditions by using sheet metal from under the seats and placing snow on it. The solar collector melted snow which  dripped into empty wine bottles. To prevent [[snow blindness]], he improvised sunglasses using the sun visors in the pilot's cabin, wire, and a bra strap. They removed the seat covers which were partially made of wool and used them to keep warm. They used the seat cushions as snow shoes. Marcelo Perez, captain of the rugby team, assumed leadership.<ref name=vlahos/><ref name=live/>\n\nNando Parrado woke from his coma after three days to learn his 19-year-old sister Susana Parrado was severely injured.

The survivors lacked medical supplies, cold-weather clothing and equipment or food, and only had three pairs of sunglasses among them to help prevent snow blindness.\n\n===Turn to cannibalism===\n\nThe survivors had extremely little food: eight chocolate bars, a tin of mussels, three small jars of jam, a tin of almonds, a few dates, candies, dried plums, and several bottles of wine. During the days following the crash, they divided this into very small amounts to make their meager supply last as long as possible. Parrado ate a single chocolate-covered peanut over three days.<ref name=live/><ref name=quigley/>\n\nEven with this strict rationing, their food stock dwindled quickly. There were no natural vegetation or animals on the glacier or nearby snow-covered mountain. The food ran out after a week, and the group tried to eat parts of the airplane like the cotton inside the seats and leather. They got sicker from eating these.<ref name=live/>\n\nOn the tenth day after the crash, the survivors learned from a transistor radio that the search had been called off. Faced with starvation and death, those still alive agreed that should they die, the others might consume their bodies in order to live. With no choice, the survivors ate the bodies of their dead friends.<ref name=vlahos>Vlahos, James  [http://www.alpineexpeditions.net/national-geographic-expedition-ii.html Return to the Andes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613111606/http://www.alpineexpeditions.net/national-geographic-expedition-ii.html |date=13 June 2018 }} 17 July 2006</ref><ref name=live/> \n\nSurvivor Roberto Canessa described the decision to eat the pilots and their dead friends and family members:\n\n{{cquote|Our common goal was to survive \u2014 but what we lacked was food.

After just a few days, we were feeling the sensation of our own bodies consuming themselves just to remain alive. Before long, we would become too weak to recover from starvation.\n\nWe knew the answer, but it was too terrible to contemplate.\n\nThe bodies of our friends and team-mates, preserved outside in the snow and ice, contained vital, life-giving protein that could help us survive. But could we do it?\n\nFor a long time, we agonised. I went out in the snow and prayed to God for guidance. Without His consent, I felt I would be violating the memory of my friends; that I would be stealing their souls.\n\nWe wondered whether we were going mad even to contemplate such a thing. Had we turned into brute savages? Or was this the only sane thing to do? Truly, we were pushing the limits of our fear.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/cannibalism-andes-plane-crash-1972-survivors-terrible-decision-stay-alive-a6895781.html|title=Plane crash survivor describes the moment he resorted to cannibalism|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171123062437/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/cannibalism-andes-plane-crash-1972-survivors-terrible-decision-stay-alive-a6895781.html| archivedate=23 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> }}\n\nThe group survived by collectively deciding to eat flesh from the bodies of their dead comrades. This decision was not taken lightly, as most of the dead were classmates, close friends, or relatives. Canessa used broken glass from the aircraft windshield as a cutting tool. He set the example by swallowing the first matchstick-sized strip of frozen flesh. Several others did the same later on. The next day more survivors ate the meat offered them, but a few refused or could not keep it down.<ref name=quigley/>\n\nIn his memoir, ''[[Miracle in the Andes: 72 Days on the Mountain and My Long Trek Home]]'' (2006), [[Nando Parrado]] wrote about this decision:\n\n{{cquote|At high altitude, the body's caloric needs are astronomical&nbsp;... we were starving in earnest, with no hope of finding food, but our hunger soon grew so voracious that we searched anyway&nbsp;... again and again, we scoured the fuselage in search of crumbs and morsels. We tried to eat strips of leather torn from pieces of luggage, though we knew that the chemicals they'd been treated with would do us more harm than good. We ripped open seat cushions hoping to find straw, but found only inedible upholstery foam&nbsp;... Again and again, I came to the same conclusion: unless we wanted to eat the clothes we were wearing, there was nothing here but aluminum, plastic, ice, and rock.<ref name=parrado/>{{rp|94\u201395}} }}\n\nParrado protected the corpses of his sister and mother, and they were never eaten. They dried the meat in the sun, which made it more palatable. They were initially so revolted by the experience that they could eat only skin, muscle and fat. When the supply of flesh was diminished, they also ate hearts, lungs and even brains.<ref name=parrado/>\n\nAll of the passengers were [[Roman Catholic]]. Some feared eternal [[damnation]]. According to Read, some rationalized the act of necrotic [[cannibalism]] as equivalent to [[Eucharist|the Eucharist]], the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ under the appearances of bread and wine. Others justified it according to a Bible verse found in [[John 15#Verse 13|John 15:13]]: \u2018No man hath greater love than this: that he lay down his life for his friends.\u2019\n\nSome initially had reservations, though after realizing that it was their only means of staying alive, they changed their minds a few days later. Javier Methol and his wife Liliana, the only surviving female passenger, were the last survivors to eat human flesh. She had strong religious convictions, and only reluctantly agreed to partake of the flesh after she was told to view it as \"a kind of Holy Communion\".<ref name=munger/>\n\n===Avalanche===\nSeventeen days after the crash, near midnight on 29 October, an avalanche struck the aircraft containing the survivors as they slept. It filled the fuselage and killed eight people: Enrique Platero, Liliana Methol, Gustavo Nicolich, Daniel Maspons, Juan Menendez, Diego Storm, Carlos Roque, and Marcelo Perez. The deaths of Perez, the team captain and leader of the survivors, and Liliana Methol, who had nursed the survivors \"like a mother and a saint\", were extremely discouraging to those remaining alive.<ref name=true/><ref name=munger>{{cite web |title=An iron cross in the mountains: The lonely site of the 1972 Andes flight disaster. |url=https://seanmunger.com/2014/10/13/an-iron-cross-in-the-mountains-the-lonely-site-of-the-1972-andes-flight-disaster/ |website=SeanMunger.com |accessdate=14 June 2018 |date=13 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe avalanche completely buried the fuselage and filled the interior to within {{convert|1|m}} of the roof. The survivors trapped inside soon realized they were running out of air. Nando Parrado found a metal pole from the luggage racks and was able to poke a hole in the fuselage roof, providing ventilation. With considerable difficulty, on the morning of 31 October they dug a tunnel from the cockpit to the surface, only to encounter a furious blizzard that left them no choice but to stay inside the fuselage.\n\nFor three days the survivors were trapped in the extremely cramped space within the buried fuselage with about {{convert|1|m}} headroom, together with the corpses of those who had died in the avalanche. With no other choice, on the third day they resorted to eating the flesh of their newly dead friends.<ref name=true/><ref name=live/>\n\nWith Perez dead, cousins Eduardo and Fito Strauch and Daniel Fern\u00e1ndez assumed leadership. They took over harvesting flesh from their deceased friends and distributing it to the others.<ref name=vlahos/>\n\nBefore the avalanche, a few of the survivors became insistent that their only way of survival would be to climb over the mountains and search for help. Because of the co-pilot's dying statement that the aircraft had passed Curic\u00f3, the group believed the Chilean countryside was just a few kilometres away to the west. They were actually more than {{convert|89|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the east, deep in the Andes. The snow that had buried the fuselage gradually melted as summer arrived. Survivors made several brief expeditions in the immediate vicinity of the aircraft in the first few weeks after the crash, but they found that altitude sickness, dehydration, snow blindness, malnourishment, and the extreme cold during the nights made traveling any significant distance an impossible task.<ref name=safety>{{cite web |title=When dead reckoning became deadly: remembering the Andes air disaster {{!}} Flight Safety Australia |url=http://www.flightsafetyaustralia.com/2017/10/when-dead-reckoning-became-deadly-remembering-the-andes-air-disaster/ |website=Flight Safety Australia |accessdate=20 June 2018 |date=13 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Expedition explores area ===\n\nThe passengers decided that a few members would seek help. Several survivors were determined to join the expedition team, including Roberto Canessa, one of the two medical students, but others were less willing or unsure of their ability to withstand such a physically exhausting ordeal. Numa Turcatti and Antonio Vizintin were chosen to accompany Canessa and Parrado. They were allocated the largest rations of food and the warmest clothes. They were also spared the daily manual labor around the crash site that was essential for the group's survival, so they could build their strength. At Canessa's urging, they waited nearly seven days to allow for higher temperatures.\n\nThey hoped to get to Chile to the west, but a large mountain lay west of the crash site, persuading them to try heading east first. They hoped that the valley they were in would make a U-turn and allow them to start walking west. On 15 November, after several hours walking east, the trio found the largely intact tail section of the aircraft containing the galley about {{convert|1|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} east and downhill of the fuselage. Inside and nearby they found luggage containing a box of chocolates, three meat patties, a bottle of rum, cigarettes, extra clothes, comic books, and a little medicine. They also found the aircraft's two-way radio. The group decided to camp that night inside the tail section. They built a fire and stayed up late reading comic books.<ref name=vlahos/>\n\nThey continued east the next morning. On the second night of the expedition, which was their first night sleeping outside, they nearly froze to death. After some debate the next morning, they decided that it would be wiser to return to the tail, remove the aircraft's batteries, and bring them back to the fuselage so they might power up the radio and make an SOS call to Santiago for help.<ref name=live/>\n\n===Radio inoperative ===\n\nUpon returning to the tail, the trio found that the {{convert|24|kg|adj=on}} batteries were too heavy to take back to the fuselage, which lay uphill from the tail section. They decided instead that it would be more effective to return to the fuselage and disconnect the radio system from the aircraft's frame, take it back to the tail, and connect it to the batteries. One of the team members, Roy Harley, was an amateur electronics enthusiast, and they recruited his help in the endeavour. Unknown to any of the team members, the aircraft's electrical system used 115 volts [[alternating current|AC]], while the battery they had located produced 24 volts [[direct current|DC]],<ref name=tragedia/> making the plan futile from the beginning.\n\nAfter several days of trying to make the radio work, they gave up and returned to the fuselage with the knowledge that they would have to climb out of the mountains if they were to have any hope of being rescued. On the return trip they were struck by a blizzard. Harley lay down to die, but Parrado would not let him stop and took him back to the fuselage.\n\n===Three more deaths ===\n\nOn 15 November, Arturo Nogueira died, and three days later, Rafael Echavarren died, both from [[gangrene]] due to their infected wounds.  Numa Turcatti, who would not eat human flesh, died on day 60 (11 December) weighing only {{convert|55|lbs}}.

They also realized that unless they found a way to survive the freezing temperature of the nights, a trek was impossible. The survivors who had found the tail came up with an idea to use insulation from the rear of the fuselage, copper wire, and waterproof fabric that covered the air conditioning of the plane to fashion a sleeping bag.<ref name=paez/><ref name=live/>\n\nNando Parrado described in his book, ''Miracle in the Andes: 72 Days on the Mountain and My Long Trek Home'', how they came up with the idea of making a sleeping bag: \n{{cquote|The second challenge would be to protect ourselves from exposure, especially after sundown. At this time of year, we could expect daytime temperatures well above freezing, but the nights were still cold enough to kill us, and we knew now that we couldn't expect to find shelter on the open slopes.\n\nWe needed a way to survive the long nights without freezing, and the quilted batts of insulation we'd taken from the tail section gave us our solution&nbsp;... as we brainstormed about the trip, we realized we could sew the patches together to create a large warm quilt. Then we realized that by folding the quilt in half and stitching the seams together, we could create an insulated sleeping bag large enough for all three expeditionaries to sleep in. With the warmth of three bodies trapped by the insulating cloth, we might be able to weather the coldest nights.\n\nCarlitos [P\u00e1ez] took on the challenge. His mother had taught him to sew when he was a boy, and with the needles and thread from the sewing kit found in his mother's cosmetic case, he began to work&nbsp;... to speed the progress, Carlitos taught others to sew, and we all took our turns&nbsp;...

While others encouraged Parrado, none would volunteer to go with him. Parrado finally persuaded Canessa to set out, and joined by Vizint\u00edn, the three men took to the mountain on 12 December.<ref name=live>{{cite web|url= http://survivaltolive.blogspot.com/2014/02/i-will-not-die-on-this-mountain.html|title=Survival|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180911231531/http://survivaltolive.blogspot.com/2014/02/i-will-not-die-on-this-mountain.html |first1=Bondan |last1=Stymulan  |archivedate=11 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Climbing the peak ===\n\n[[File:Crash site.JPG|right|thumb|View of peak to the west that the three men climbed. The Crash Site Memorial in the foreground was created after the survivors' rescue.]]\nOn 12 December 1972, two months after the crash, Parrado, Canessa, and Vizint\u00edn began to climb the mountain to their west. Based on the aircraft's altimeter, they thought they were at {{convert|7000|ft}}, when they were actually at about {{convert|11800|ft|0}}. Given the pilot's dying statement that they were near Curic\u00f3, they believed that they were near the western edge of the Andes. As a result, they brought only a three-day supply of meat.<ref name=historia/>\n\nParrado wore three pairs of jeans and three sweaters over a polo shirt. He wore four pairs of socks wrapped in a plastic shopping bag. They had no technical gear, no map or compass, and no climbing experience. Instead of climbing the saddle to the west that is {{convert|1670|m}} lower than the peak, they climbed straight up the steep mountain.<ref name=home/> They thought they would reach the peak in one day. Parrado took the lead and the other two often had to remind him to slow down, although the thin [[oxygen]] made it difficult for all of them. During part of the climb, they sank up to their hips in the snow, which had been softened by the summer sun.<ref name=live/>\n\nIt was still bitterly cold, but the sleeping bag allowed them to live through the nights. In the film ''[[Stranded: I've Come from a Plane that Crashed in the Mountains|Stranded]]'', Canessa described how on the first night during the ascent, they had difficulty finding a place to put down the sleeping bag. A storm blew fiercely, and they finally found a spot on a ledge of rock, on the edge of an abyss. Canessa said it was the worst night of his life. The climb was very slow; the survivors at the fuselage watched them climb for three days. On the second day, Canessa thought he saw a road to the east, and tried to persuade Parrado to head in that direction. Parrado disagreed and they argued without reaching a decision.<ref name=historia/>\n\nOn the third morning of the trek, Canessa stayed at their camp. Vizint\u00edn and Parrado reached the base of a near-vertical wall more than one hundred meters (300 feet) tall encased in snow and ice. Parrado was determined to hike out or die trying. He used a stick from his pack to carve steps in the wall. He gained the summit of the {{convert|4650|m}} high peak before Vizint\u00edn. Thinking he would see the green valleys of Chile to the west, he was stunned to see a vast array of mountain peaks in every direction. They had climbed a mountain on the border of Argentina and Chile, meaning the trekkers were still tens of kilometres from the green valleys of Chile. Vizint\u00edn and Parrado rejoined Canessa where they had slept the night before. At sunset, sipping cognac they had found in the tail section, Parrado said, \"Roberto, can you imagine how beautiful this would be if we were not dead men?\"<ref name=home/> The next morning, the three men could see that the hike was going to take much longer than they had originally planned. They were running out of food, so Vizint\u00edn agreed to return to the crash site. The return was entirely downhill, and using an aircraft seat as a makeshift [[sleigh]], he returned to the crash site in one hour.<ref name=historia/>\n\nParrado and Canessa took three hours to climb to the summit. When Canessa reached the top and saw nothing but snow-capped mountains for kilometres around them, his first thought was, \"We're dead.\"<ref name=live/> Parrado saw two smaller peaks on the western horizon that were not covered in snow. A valley at the base of the mountain they stood on wound its way towards the peaks. Parrado was sure this was their way out of the mountains. He refused to give up hope. Canessa agreed to go west. Only much later did Canessa learn that the trail he saw would have gotten them to rescue.<ref name=home>{{cite web|url=https://www.outsideonline.com/1824341/long-way-home|title=The Long Way Home - Outside Online|date=1 May 2006|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Connelly |first1=Sherryl |title=Survivor of 1972 Andes plane crash who resorted to cannibalism reveals struggle in new book, 'I Had to Survive' - NY Daily News |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/andes-crash-survivor-ate-friends-tells-new-book-article-1.2538568 |website=nydailynews.com |accessdate=14 June 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171112130258/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/andes-crash-survivor-ate-friends-tells-new-book-article-1.2538568 |archivedate=12 November 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn the summit, Parrado told Canessa, \"We may be walking to our deaths, but I would rather walk to meet my death than wait for it to come to me.\" Canessa agreed. \"You and I are friends, Nando.

They followed the river and reached the [[snowline]].<ref name=live/><ref name=historia/>\n\nGradually, there appeared more and more signs of human presence; first some evidence of camping, and finally on the ninth day, some cows.

One of the men across the river saw Parrado and Canessa and called back, \"Tomorrow!\" The next day, the man returned.

Shortly after our rescue, officials of the Catholic Church announced that according to church doctrine we had committed no sin by eating the flesh of the dead. As Roberto had argued on the mountain, they told the world that the sin would have been to allow ourselves to die. More satisfying for me was the fact that many of the parents of the boys who died had publicly expressed their support for us, telling the world they understood and accepted what we had done to survive... despite these gestures, many news reports focused on the matter of our diet, in reckless and exploitive ways.

They were able, therefore, to grow valuable market crops such as potatoes, melons and tobacco immediately around the village, sow fine grains in the ''manjha'', and restrict the poor millet subsistence crops to the periphery.

Elsewhere these were wholly novel demands, many being imposed on 'clean' tillers and cattle-keepers like the Ram- and Krishna-loving Koeris, Kurmis and Ahirs ... In either case, these calls were buttressed with appeals to Sanskritic varna theory and Brahmanical caste convention. ...

The Kurmi fell into two such categories. In the ethnological map of India published in the 1909 Imperial Gazetteer of India and based on the 1901 Census supervised by Risley, the Kurmi of the United Provinces were classified as \"Aryo-Dravidian,\" whereas the Kurmi of the [[Central Provinces]] were counted among \"Dravidians\".<ref name=\"bayly-p41\" /> In the 1901 Census of India, the category of [[varna]], the four-fold graded system, was included in the official classification of caste,<ref name=\"RudolphRudolph1984\">{{cite book|last1=Rudolph|first1=Lloyd I.|last2=Rudolph|first2=Susanne Hoeber|title=The Modernity of Tradition: Political Development in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7guY1ut-0lwC|year=1984|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-73137-7|page=116}}</ref> the only time this was the case.{{efn|Although influential, Risley's attempt did not achieve the end which he sought: people were unable to determine in which group they should classify themselves, the localised system he adopted could not be transposed onto the national stage, and some groups took advantage of the situation deliberately to seek reclassification and therefore satisfy their aspirations.

In the north, these observers claimed, a field of 'second-rate barley' would belong to a Rajput or Brahman who took pride in shunning the plough and secluding his womenfolk. Such a man was to be blamed for his own decline, fecklessly mortgaging and then selling off his lands to maintain his unproductive dependents. By the same logic, a flourishing field of wheat would belong to a non-twice-born tiller, wheat being a crop requiring skill and enterprise on the part of the cultivator.

The governor\u2019s office was flooded with letters from an outraged Kurmi-kshatriya public and was soon obliged to rescind the allegation in an 1896 communique to the police department \"His Honor [the governor] is ... of the opinion that Kurmis constitute a respectable community which he would be reluctant to exclude from Government service.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=William R. |last=Pinch|title=Peasants and monks in British India|url=https://archive.org/details/peasantsmonksinb0000pinc|url-access=registration |year=1996|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-20061-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/peasantsmonksinb0000pinc/page/89 89]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe first Kurmi caste association had been formed in 1894 at [[Lucknow]] to protest against the police recruitment policy.

The Triveni Sangh suffered badly in the 1937 elections, although it did win in some areas. The organisation also suffered from caste rivalries, notably the superior organisational ability of the higher castes who opposed it, as well as the inability of the Yadavs to renounce their belief that they were natural leaders and that the Kurmi were somehow inferior.

The industry of his wife has passed into a proverb: <br>\n''Bhali j\u00e2t Kurmin, khurpi h\u00e2t,'' <br>\n''Khet nir\u00e2w\u00ea apan p\u00ee k\u00ea s\u00e2th.'' <br>\n\"A good lot is the Kurmi woman; she takes her spud and weeds the field with her lord.\"<ref name=\"Crooke1896-p353-354\">{{cite book|last=Crooke|first=William|title=The tribes and castes of the North-western Provinces and Oudh, Volume III|url=https://archive.org/details/tribesandcastes01croogoog|year=1896|publisher=Office of the superintendent of government printing|pages=[https://archive.org/details/tribesandcastes01croogoog/page/n374 353]\u2013354}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Susan Bayly, <blockquote> By the mid-nineteenth century, influential revenue specialists were reporting that they could tell the caste of a landed man by simply glancing at his crops. In the north, these observers claimed, a field of 'second-rate barley' would belong to a Rajput or Brahman who took pride in shunning the plough and secluding his womenfolk. Such a man was to be blamed for his own decline, fecklessly mortgaging and then selling off his lands to maintain his unproductive dependents. By the same logic, a flourishing field of wheat would belong to a non-twice-born tiller, wheat being a crop requiring skill and enterprise on the part of the cultivator. These, said such commentators as Denzil Ibbetson and E. A. H. Blunt, were the qualities of the non-patrician 'peasant'&nbsp;\u2013 the thrifty Jat or canny Kurmi in upper India, .... Similar virtues would be found among the smaller market-gardening populations, these being the people known as Keoris in Hindustan, ....<ref name=\"bayly-p41\" /></blockquote>\n\n===Twentieth century===\nAs the economic pressures on the patrician landed groups continued through the remainder of the nineteenth century and into the early twentieth, there were increasing demands for unpaid labour directed at the Kurmi and other non-elite cultivators.<ref name=\"bayly-p41\" />  The landed elites' demands were couched in avowals of their ancient rights as \"twice-born\" landowners and of the Kurmi's alleged lowly, even servile, status, which required them to serve.<ref name=\"bayly-p41\" />  At times encouraged by sympathetic British officials and at other times carried by the groundswell of egalitarian sentiment being espoused then by the devotional [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] movements, especially those based on [[Tulsidas]]'s ''[[Ramcharitmanas]]'', the Kurmi largely resisted these demands.<ref name=\"bayly-p41\" />  Their resistance, however, did not take the form of denial of caste or of caste-based imposition, but rather of disagreement about where they stood in the caste ranking.<ref name=\"bayly-p41\" />  A noteworthy attribute of the resulting Kurmi-kshatriya movement was the leadership provided by educated Kurmis who were now filling the lower and middle levels of government jobs.<ref name=\"Pinch1996-p84\"/> According to William Pinch: <blockquote> The mantle of leadership in this phase befell the well-connected Ramdin Sinha, a government forester who had gained notoriety by resigning from his official post to protest a provincial circular of 1894 that included Kurmis as a \"depressed community\" and barred them therefore from recruitment into the police service. The governor\u2019s office was flooded with letters from an outraged Kurmi-kshatriya public and was soon obliged to rescind the allegation in an 1896 communique to the police department \"His Honor [the governor] is ... of the opinion that Kurmis constitute a respectable community which he would be reluctant to exclude from Government service.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=William R. |last=Pinch|title=Peasants and monks in British India|url=https://archive.org/details/peasantsmonksinb0000pinc|url-access=registration |year=1996|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-20061-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/peasantsmonksinb0000pinc/page/89 89]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe first Kurmi caste association had been formed in 1894 at [[Lucknow]] to protest against the police recruitment policy. This was followed by an organisation in Awadh that sought to draw other communities&nbsp;\u2014 such as the [[Patidar]]s, [[Maratha]]s, [[Kapu]]s, [[Reddy]]s and [[Naidu]]s&nbsp;\u2014 under the umbrella of the Kurmi name. This body then campaigned for Kurmis to classify themselves as Kshatriya in the 1901 census and, in 1910, led to the formation of the [[All India Kurmi Kshatriya Mahasabha]].<ref name=Jaffrelot2003p197>{{cite book |title=India's silent revolution: the rise of the lower castes in North India |page=197 |first=Christophe |last=Jaffrelot |publisher=C.

They lost badly but in 1934 the three communities formed the [[Triveni Sangh]] political party, which allegedly had a million dues-paying members by 1936. However, the organisation was hobbled by competition from the Congress-backed [[Backward Class]] Federation, which was formed around the same time, and by co-option of community leaders by the Congress party. The Triveni Sangh suffered badly in the 1937 elections, although it did win in some areas. The organisation also suffered from caste rivalries, notably the superior organisational ability of the higher castes who opposed it, as well as the inability of the Yadavs to renounce their belief that they were natural leaders and that the Kurmi were somehow inferior. Similar problems beset a later planned caste union, the ''Raghav Samaj'', with the Koeris.<ref name=Jaffrelot2003p197/>\n\nAgain in the 1970s, the India Kurmi Kshatriya Sabha attempted to bring the Koeris under their wing, but disunity troubled this alliance.<ref>{{cite news |first=Akshaya |last=Mukul |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/young-india-votes/news/Mighty-Kurmis-of-Bihar/articleshow/555124.cms |title=Mighty Kurmis of Bihar |work=The Times of India |date=12 March 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Fernandes to head Janata Dal (United) | url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/2003/10/31/stories/2003103104371100.htm | author=Gargi Parsai | date=31 October 2003 | newspaper=The Hindu | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65xylZw3k?url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/2003/10/31/stories/2003103104371100.htm | archivedate=6 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nMany private caste-based armies surfaced in Bihar between the 1970s and 1990s, largely influenced by landlord farmers reacting to the growing influence of left extremist groups.

The  \"Quest for sword of light\" formula is catalogued as [[Motif-Index of Folk-Literature|motif]] H1337.\n\nThe sword appears commonly as a quest object in the Irish folktale of a hero seeking \"The One Story\" (or the \"Cause of the one story about women\"), which culiminates in the discovery of a \"Tale of the Werewolf\" (a man magically turned wolf by an unfaithful wife). However, the sword is uninvolved in the man-wolf portion, and only figures in the hero-adventure [[frame story]].\n\nThe sword of light,  according to a different commentator, is a fixture of an Irish tale group describable as a quasi-bridal-quest. This characterization is inspired by the formula where the hero gains a beautiful wife (and riches) by gambling against a [[gruagach]] or wizard, but then suffers loses making him beholden to mount a hopeless-seeming quest. Like the actual \"giant's daughter\" bridal quest tales, the sword of light hero often gains the assistance of \"helpful animals\" help him complete his tasks or ordeals.\n\nThe sword has been regarded as a legacy to the god-slaying weapons of [[Irish mythology]] by certain scholars, such as [[T. F. O'Rahilly]], the analogues being the primeval Celtic deity's lightning-weapon, [[Lugh]]'s sling that felled [[Balor]], the hero [[C\u00fachulainn]]'s supernatural spear [[Gae bulga]] and his shining sword Cruaid\u00edn Catutchenn.\n\n==Forms==\n\nThe spelling as appears in published Irish text and scholastic commentary is ''Claidheamh Soluis''<ref name=oceochain/> alternatively '''''(an) cloidheamh solais''''';<ref>{{harvp|O'Rahilly|1946}}, EIHM, p. 68; {{harvp|Kennedy|1866|pp=261ff}}.</ref> but these are pre-reform spelling, and in modernized [[Irish orthography#Spelling reform|reformed spelling]] ''Cla\u00edomh Solais'' would be used.<ref name=mackillop-claidheamh_soluis/> The name has also been transliterated into [[Hiberno-English]] as '''chloive solais'''.{{sfnp|Kennedy|1866|p=270}} The sword may be rendered in English as the \"Sword of Light\", or \"'''Shining Sword'''\".<ref name=puhvel-note27>{{harvp|Puhvel|1972|loc=p. 214, n27}}</ref>\n\nLikewise, the [[Scottish Gaelic]] form is {{lang|gd|claidheamh soluis}} \"glaive of light\", <ref name=campbell-easaidh-ruadh/> or {{lang|gd|claidheamh geal soluis }} \"White Glave of Light\".<ref>{{harvp|Campbell|1860|loc='''I''': lxxvii}}</ref><ref name=puhvel-note27/>{{Refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|While [[glaive]] can denote a broadsword, though it may often refer to a polearm<ref name=oxford-dict-glaive/>.}}\n\n== Overview ==\nThe folk tales featuring the sword of light may be bridal quests, and the hero's would-be bride often becomes the hero's helper.<ref name=curtin1890-thirteenth-son/><ref name=campbell-widows-son/>{{Refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|Or involve the winning of husbands in e.g., Maol a Chliobain.<ref name=campbell-maol/>}}\n\nBut more typically the story is a sort of quasi-bridal quest,{{efn|Joseph Baudi\u0161 remarks the tale group is similar to the \"''quest for the bride''\".}}<ref name=baudis-sword-of-light/> where the hero wins a bride by wager, but then suffers a loss, becoming oath-bound (compelled by ''[[geis]]''{{Refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|By laying a [[geas]] or geasa  (taboo), e.g., Kennedy's version,<ref>{{harvp|Kennedy|1866|p=260}}: \"I lay geasa on you\".</ref> \u00d3 Cill\u00edn ed. <ref>{{harvp|\u00d3 Cill\u00edn|1933|p=163}}: \"The prince fulfils his obligations (geasa)\".</ref> Cf.

From the heroic cycles, some prominent examples are [[Fergus Mac Roigh]]'s sword [[Caladbolg]] and Mac Cecht's spear.

In the ''[[Huth Merlin]]'', [[Morgan le Fay]] plots to have Arthur killed with his own Excalibur, by stealing the sword for her lover Accalon, who unbeknownst fights his lord King Arthur with it. The [[Lady of the Lake]] intercedes at the right moment to prevent Arthur's death.{{sfn|Puhvel|1972|pp=214\u2013215}} The episode has been copied by Malory as well{{sfn|Puhvel|1972|pp=214\u2013215}} (with the knight being called Accolon unlike the French original)<ref>Malory, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=kpsdpva9Q-8C&pg=PA80 Le Morte D'Arthur]'', Book IV, Chapters 8-30.

The  \"Quest for sword of light\" formula is catalogued as [[Motif-Index of Folk-Literature|motif]] H1337.\n\nThe sword appears commonly as a quest object in the Irish folktale of a hero seeking \"The One Story\" (or the \"Cause of the one story about women\"), which culiminates in the discovery of a \"Tale of the Werewolf\" (a man magically turned wolf by an unfaithful wife). However, the sword is uninvolved in the man-wolf portion, and only figures in the hero-adventure [[frame story]].\n\nThe sword of light,  according to a different commentator, is a fixture of an Irish tale group describable as a quasi-bridal-quest. This characterization is inspired by the formula where the hero gains a beautiful wife (and riches) by gambling against a [[gruagach]] or wizard, but then suffers loses making him beholden to mount a hopeless-seeming quest. Like the actual \"giant's daughter\" bridal quest tales, the sword of light hero often gains the assistance of \"helpful animals\" help him complete his tasks or ordeals.\n\nThe sword has been regarded as a legacy to the god-slaying weapons of [[Irish mythology]] by certain scholars, such as [[T. F. O'Rahilly]], the analogues being the primeval Celtic deity's lightning-weapon, [[Lugh]]'s sling that felled [[Balor]], the hero [[C\u00fachulainn]]'s supernatural spear [[Gae bulga]] and his shining sword Cruaid\u00edn Catutchenn.\n\n==Forms==\n\nThe spelling as appears in published Irish text and scholastic commentary is ''Claidheamh Soluis''<ref name=oceochain/> alternatively '''''(an) cloidheamh solais''''';<ref>{{harvp|O'Rahilly|1946}}, EIHM, p. 68; {{harvp|Kennedy|1866|pp=261ff}}.</ref> but these are pre-reform spelling, and in modernized [[Irish orthography#Spelling reform|reformed spelling]] ''Cla\u00edomh Solais'' would be used.<ref name=mackillop-claidheamh_soluis/> The name has also been transliterated into [[Hiberno-English]] as '''chloive solais'''.{{sfnp|Kennedy|1866|p=270}} The sword may be rendered in English as the \"Sword of Light\", or \"'''Shining Sword'''\".<ref name=puhvel-note27>{{harvp|Puhvel|1972|loc=p. 214, n27}}</ref>\n\nLikewise, the [[Scottish Gaelic]] form is {{lang|gd|claidheamh soluis}} \"glaive of light\", <ref name=campbell-easaidh-ruadh/> or {{lang|gd|claidheamh geal soluis }} \"White Glave of Light\".<ref>{{harvp|Campbell|1860|loc='''I''': lxxvii}}</ref><ref name=puhvel-note27/>{{Refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|While [[glaive]] can denote a broadsword, though it may often refer to a polearm<ref name=oxford-dict-glaive/>.}}\n\n== Overview ==\nThe folk tales featuring the sword of light may be bridal quests, and the hero's would-be bride often becomes the hero's helper.<ref name=curtin1890-thirteenth-son/><ref name=campbell-widows-son/>{{Refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|Or involve the winning of husbands in e.g., Maol a Chliobain.<ref name=campbell-maol/>}}\n\nBut more typically the story is a sort of quasi-bridal quest,{{efn|Joseph Baudi\u0161 remarks the tale group is similar to the \"''quest for the bride''\".}}<ref name=baudis-sword-of-light/> where the hero wins a bride by wager, but then suffers a loss, becoming oath-bound (compelled by ''[[geis]]''{{Refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|By laying a [[geas]] or geasa  (taboo), e.g., Kennedy's version,<ref>{{harvp|Kennedy|1866|p=260}}: \"I lay geasa on you\".</ref> \u00d3 Cill\u00edn ed. <ref>{{harvp|\u00d3 Cill\u00edn|1933|p=163}}: \"The prince fulfils his obligations (geasa)\".</ref> Cf.

From the heroic cycles, some prominent examples are [[Fergus Mac Roigh]]'s sword [[Caladbolg]] and Mac Cecht's spear.

In the ''[[Huth Merlin]]'', [[Morgan le Fay]] plots to have Arthur killed with his own Excalibur, by stealing the sword for her lover Accalon, who unbeknownst fights his lord King Arthur with it. The [[Lady of the Lake]] intercedes at the right moment to prevent Arthur's death.{{sfn|Puhvel|1972|pp=214\u2013215}} The episode has been copied by Malory as well{{sfn|Puhvel|1972|pp=214\u2013215}} (with the knight being called Accolon unlike the French original)<ref>Malory, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=kpsdpva9Q-8C&pg=PA80 Le Morte D'Arthur]'', Book IV, Chapters 8-30.

Under Jean Grey's leadership, they defeat [[Black Tom Cassidy]], [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], and a group of mutant sentinels in Barcelona led by [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]]. Unknown to the team, Magneto is secretly building a Time Platform to send the young X-Men back to their time period of origin.<ref>{{Cite book|title=X-Men Blue #1\u20133|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nAfter learning of a [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]]-related disturbance in the North, the X-Men investigate alongside a local sheriff named Kira Lee and encounter an amnesiac [[Jimmy Hudson]], who helps defeat the Wendigo, on the run from other mutants who also came from the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]]. During the ensuing battle Jean ends up in telepathic contact with Miss Sinister, who takes a keen interest in her. After the battle ends they decide to bring Jimmy with them to join their team instead of sending him to the school with [[Kitty Pryde]] in order to better protect him and keep him under the radar. While exploring Madripoor during a festival on a night off, Jean, Beast and Jimmy confront a group of mutants, known as the Raksha, who were buying a chemical from a local dealer. Upon seeing Jimmy's claws the Raksha voluntarily end the fight, acknowledging the X-Men as allies due to everyone involved having a positive history with [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].<ref>''X-Men: Blue'' #4\u20136</ref>\n\n===Toil and Trobule===\nDuring the ''[[Secret Empire (comic book)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, the team rebels against the government of New Tian, located somewhere in [[California]], following [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]]'s takeover of the United States. While in their hideout, they're attacked by [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], [[Archangel (Marvel Comics)|Archangel]], [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]], [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]], [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], [[Mondo (comics)|Mondo]] and [[Toad (comics)|Toad]] who were sent by [[Emma Frost]]. Each of them exhibited much stronger abilities which Beast concludes is due to secondary mutations. While Jean and Jimmy escape, the rest of the team is captured. Emma then talks to Cyclops in his cell. As Jean and Jimmy regroup and plan their next move they are rescued by [[Danger Room#Sentience|Danger]], who stages a series of elaborate holograms to keep Emma's forces occupied. The rest of the team begins to lose hope as Emma begins telepathically tormenting Cyclops. Havok is about to intercept Jean and Jimmy when he is suddenly ambushed by [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris]]. While Polaris fights Havok, Jean and Jimmy manage to rescue their teammates and Briar until they're caught by Emma, who has upgraded her powers using a fragment of the [[Cosmic Cube]], allowing her to take control of Cyclops and force him to attack his teammates. Jean manages to release Cyclops from Emma's mental control and the team successfully escapes. Meanwhile, Magneto speaks with [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] about the team's recent actions and Emma and Havok meet with Miss Sinister and Bastion.<ref>''X-Men: Blue'' #7\u20139</ref>\n\nSometime later, it's revealed that Beast has learned his magic from the [[Goblin Queen]], who was using him to free a group of demons known as the Hex-Men who take the form of [[Pixie (comics)|Pixie]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Bloodstorm (Marvel Comics)|Bloodstorm]] and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] so that she may begin a dark ritual to summon her fellow Queens to take the world as their own. Danger trains Iceman and notes that he is distracted which could endanger the team during a fight because his boyfriend Romeo has stopped replying to his calls and messages. Jean and Scott find out that, when she released him from Emma's mind control, that a unique, unbreakable connection had formed between them meaning that they will always be able to read each other's minds. This initially causes some conflict as Jean discovers that Scott is jealous of her budding relationship with Jimmy. While trying to make sense of their new connection, the pair almost kiss but are interrupted by a massive explosion as the Golbin Queen begins her attack. The team confronts the Goblin Queen and the Hex-Men, seeing Beast transformed into a demonic creature.  During the battle, Jean and Scott manage to escape with help from the teleporting demon Pickles and enlist the aid of the Raksha. Back at the mansion, the Goblin Queen and the Hex-Men manage to capture the rest of the team and begin a ritual to summon the Goblin Queen's sisters. During the ritual, Jean, Scott and the Rashka infiltrate the mansion and battle the Goblin Queen's demons. Bloodstorm realises that the promises made to her by the Golbin Queen are false and that she will dispose of the Hex-Men once her sisters have been summoned so she betrays her and convinces Beast to break the Goblin Queen's hold on him and banish her to the hellish dimension where her sisters have been trapped. In the aftermath, Bloodstorm, is welcomed into the team despite her worries that she will massacre them as she did to the X-Men of her own reality.\n\nMeanwhile, Angel and Jimmy return to Colorado and join forces with Kira to investigate Jimmy's mysterious past only to discover a hidden lab where they find [[Blob (comics)|Blob]], who had been experimented on by Miss Sinister. When they enter, a special holographic message from Miss Sinister activates because it is attuned to Jimmy's genetic code but Angel turns it off before they can hear what she has to say because he believes she is trying to manipulate them. Angel, Kira and Jimmy battle Blob until he starts to melt as a side effect of the experiments and Angel vows to help him. They realise that the mutants that attacked them in New Tian must have been experimented on by Miss Sinister as well, meaning their powers were not because of secondary mutations. After finding the bodies of dead mutants, they theorise that the experiments, which Sinister refers to as \"Mothervine\" must be harmful to mutants, killing some but greatly powering up those who survive.<ref>''X-Men: Blue'' #10-12</ref>\n\n===\"Mojo Worldwide\"===\nWhen the team are invited to the Xavier Institute by Kitty, their reunion is interrupted by three floating objects that land in various areas of New York. The Blue and [[X-Men Gold|Gold]] teams join forces and split off into groups to investigate. When they come into contact with the objects, a powerful force fields surrounds them that they are unable to escape from. The force fields create virtual reality constructs of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]] and the [[Days of Future Past|Future]] that Rachel came from. Their clothing is transformed and the teams begin to fight off approaching enemies. It is revealed that [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]], in an effort to boost his ratings, is creating a special \"greatest hits\" show that recreates famous X-Men battles from throughout their history and that he is broadcasting it live to audiences across the multiverse.<ref>''X-Men Gold'' #12</ref> The first team, consisting of Kitty, Prestige, Cyclops and Bloodstorm, try to rescue civilians in the Future but they are interrupted by Mojo who broadcasts his face onto an army of [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]]. Proving to them that the threats they face are real and not simply special effects, impales Bloodstorm on a metal spear, killing her. Prestige used Scott and Jean\u2019s psychic connection to boost her own telepathy, enabling her to contact Logan, Storm, Angel and Iceman who are trapped in Asgard battling Frost Trolls and Nightcrawler, Colossus, Jimmy, Beast and Marvel Girl who are fighting demons in Inferno to tell them that Mojo is behind everything. The first team is rescued from the Sentinels by [[Longshot (Marvel Comics)|Longshot]], who has hacked into Mojo's system and is broadcasting his adventures to his own subscribers. Mojo becomes angry when he is informed that his ratings are not rising as quickly as he expected so he begins showering his audience with gifts and encourages them to vote on which scenario they would like to see the X-Men face using an app.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #13</ref>\n\nTransported to [[Asteroid M]], Longshot, Kitty, Prestige and Cyclops are forced to fight a simulation of Magneto. Scott then admits that the X-Men Blue have been working with Magneto and concludes that they never should have agreed as it is impossible for someone to change their behaviour so significantly. Meanwhile, Logan, Storm, Iceman and Angel are sent to the [[X-Tinction Agenda]] where they come under attack by the [[Magistrates (comics)|Magistrates]] and the [[Press Gang (comics)|Press Gang]] who swiftly kill the entire team. Meanwhile, Marvel Girl, Beast, Jimmy, Colossus and Nightcrawler are still fighting demons and are confronted by a simulation of the [[Goblin Queen]] who Jean manages to defeat, causing the team to be teleported to the [[Savage Land (comics)|Savage Land]].<ref>''X-Men Gold'' #13</ref> Mojo is delighted when [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris]], [[Danger (comics)|Danger]] and the real Magneto arrive to rescue the X-Men, sending them into the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlock tunnels]] to face the [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]. Longshot manages to teleport his team away from the Avengers.Still in the Savage land, Hank uses magic to fight off their enemies, much to the concern of Jean. Longshot and the others arrive and the surviving X-Men regroup before freeing the X-Men that had previously been \u201ckilled\u201d from stasis chambers on [[Mojo (comics)|Mojoworld]].<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #14</ref>   Magneto, Polaris and Danger defeat Apocalypse but then come face-to-face with the [[Shi'ar]] and [[Krakoa]] although Danger manages to free them from the simulation. While the rest of the X-Men engage [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]] and Mojo's forces, Kitty finds out the location of Mojo's control room.<ref>''X-Men Gold'' #16</ref> The team reach the control room for their final showdown with Mojo, who leeches energy from his viewers to increase his strength. He appears to be getting the upper hand until Magento and Polaris arrive and combine their powers to create an EMP that disables his broadcasting technology, leaving him helpless. Kitty berates the young X-Men for working with Magneto and confronts Magneto about his actions but Colossus convinces her to stand down. After teleporting away, Mojo and his crew are stranded on Earth but manage to set up their own news network.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #15</ref>\n\n===\"Cross Time Capers\"===\nThe X-Men return to Magneto's mansion in Madripoor. Jean, concerned about Hank after he attempted to cast more spells, starts keeping an eye on him although Hank believes she is only hanging out with him in order to stay away from Scott, who she has started developing feelings for. Scott also tries to separate himself from Jean (even though their psychic rapport means the pair can never truly be alone) and grows closer to Bloodstorm, who he realises he has more in common with than he first thought. Bobby watches Mojo's new television show in which contestants attempt to survive a day being hunted by various creatures to win a cash prize. Polaris and Angel train Jimmy but they are interrupted when Polaris suddenly disappears. Sensing this, Jean and Hank rush to Mangeto who instructs her to read his mind. Jean discovers that Magneto has somehow been communicating with [[Professor Xavier]] from beyond the grave and, before disappearing, Magneto orders them into the labs underneath the mansion. The X-Men find out that Mangneto had been secretly building a time machine to send them back home and, believing they are to blame for the disappearances, Hank activates the machine in the hope that returning to their original time will fix the timestream. The machine mistakenly sends the team to [[X-Men 2099|2099]] where they are confronted by the X-Men of that timeline. Hank explains that he believes something has happened in their original time and, because the X-Men were not there to stop it, ripples through time are erasing people from existence. They find out 2099 is a dystopian future where the original five X-Men have destroyed the planet and leave most people to starve and die. Horrified, Hank and the team travel to another time in the hope of rewriting history so that this future will never happen. The device sends them to the wrong time period again and the X-Men are forced to battle the students of [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]] but the battle is interrupted by the student's teachers [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] and Emma Frost, who reveal that the original X-Men turned on them and decimated any attempts at resistance. Hank finally manages to teleport the team back to their original time.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #16-18</ref>\n\nIn the past, due to the absence of the X-Men when they travelled to the future, evil versions of the original X-Men from an alternate reality lead by Professor X took their place and killed Magneto using a nuclear missile. That time's original Xavier is kept hooked up to Cerebro but somehow managed to send a message through time to Magneto in the present asking for help. Hank manages to rescue Magneto just before his death and he reluctantly teams up with the X-Men. It is revealed that the evil X-Men are actually the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] who were last encountered by the team during the [[Battle of the Atom]] storyline. The teams engage each other in combat, with Beast teleporting in the 2099 X-Men and Generation X while Jean locates and rescues their Professor X from Cerebro. The Brotherhood jump back into the timestream before they can be apprehended and the X-Men have a tearful reunion with their Xavier, who explains that there is still things they must do before they can stay in their time, noting that when they do return for good, it must be from the exact moment in which they left. Sending them back to the present, the X-Men find that Magneto and the others have returned with no memory of what has happened, although Bobby quickly fills him in. The X-Men are disheartened that they must eventually return to the original time, with Bobby particularly upset that all of their growth as people will be undone. Magneto finds the Brotherhood in the timestream and kills them for what they have done.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #19-20</ref>\n\n===\"Poison X\"===\nDuring Scott's video call between Scott and his father [[Corsair (comics)|Corsair]], he and the rest of the [[Starjammers]] are attacked by people wearing [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiotes]]. Before the call cuts off, Corsair shouts some co-ordinates to Scott which are also heard by Jean via their psychic rapport. Hoping to find answers, the X-Men intercept [[Venom (Eddie Brock)|Venom]] during one of his missions. While Eddie Brock refuses to go with the X-Men, his Venom symbiote wants to learn more about what is going on and puts him to sleep so that the X-Men can question him. They locate the Strarjammer's ship and are greeted by [[Sikorsky (comics)|Sikorsky]], who hid during the attack and explains more about the symbiotes that were responsible. Fearful of the damager they can do, Venom agrees to help the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' Annual #1</ref> After barely surviving an encounter with some of the symbiotes, Scott is badly wounded and the X-Men retreat while Venom manages to track down the arms dealer responsible for selling the symbiotes however, once inside, a battle ensues causing some of the symbiotes to bond with the X-Men. The team board the ship of the symbiote-wearing bounty hunters who have been holding the Starjammers hostage and incapacitate them, enabling Scott to free his father. Jean's psychic link is suddenly severed and it is revealed that Poisons, special symbiotes that completely take over a host and turn them into a weapon, have boarded the ship and bonded with her, killing her.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #21-22</ref>\n\n===\"Cry Havok\"===\nMagneto discovers that Emma Frost and the Hellfire Club are planning something and heads to their mansion to investigate, coming face to face with [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] whose powers have been augmented by Miss Sinister. Although they pretend to be in league with Miss Sinister and [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]] (who are planning to use their combined technology to cause an increase in the mutant population), Havok and Emma Frost privately conspire to double cross them when the moment arises. [[Malice (comics)|Malice]] is revealed to have possessed Polaris and, although she manages to break free, Malice has already gravely injured the Raksha leaving only one, Gazing Nightshade, unharmed. Jimmy and Bloodstorm rescue [[Xorn (comics)|Xorn]] from a group of [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] and regroup with Polaris, Gazing Nightshade and new recruit [[Daken]] to form a new team of X-Men. Mangeto meets with Miss Sinister, Bastion, Havok and Emma and tries to convince them to reconsider their actions but they refuse and defeat him. The group unleash their technology and mutants all over the world begin to develop new mutations that they are unable to control. Miss Sinister reveals that their technology also takes away their free will, allowing her to control them and, while Emma is taken aback, Havok explains that he knew all along and supports her plan. The X-Men do battle with the mutants and are captured while Magneto flees and meets with [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] and [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]] who help him to heal the new mutants. Emma turns on Sinister and frees Jimmy, who kills Sinister, before releasing the rest of the X-Men. Xorn sacrifices himself to kill Bastion and Polaris, with Emma's help, breaks through to Havok and makes him see the error of his ways. Emma meets with Magneto, who vows to destroy her for what she has done. In the depths of space, a traumatised Cyclops is unable to come to terms with Jean's death and, despite having some difficulty, Beast manages to fly their ship back home.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #23-28</ref>\n\n===\"Surviving the Experience\"===\nFollowing an invasion of Earth by the Poisons, which results and Jean being resurrected, the X-Men search for Jimmy, who was taken over by one of the last surviving Poisons.<ref>''Venomized'' #5</ref> They track him to the woods where they try to break through to Jimmy and encourage him to fight against the Poison which is controlling him but they are interrupted by Daken who announces that he has been sent by Magneto to assassinate Jimmy. Jean lets Jimmy go off to find himself. Searching for Emma, Magneto attacks several Hellfire Club parties and kills everyone in attendance. The X-Men investigate, shocked that Magneto is capable of such things but Bloodstorm explains that, while the X-Men were in space, Magneto was forced to kill some of the mind-controlled mutants he had sworn to protect and that he is now seeking revenge on those that caused it. The X-Men track Emma to France and offer to help protect her from Magneto, who subsequently attacks with powers enhanced using mutant growth hormone. After they help Emma escape, it becomes clear that Magneto is too powerful for the X-Men and, not wanting to kill the team he had mentored, Magneto leaves. Jean meets with her adult self and the two speak about their various resurrections. The younger Jean expresses her wish that they would have had more time to get to know one another but that the time-displaced X-Men must return to their original time soon. She expresses her sadness that their minds must all be erased of their experiences in the present so that they do not change things when they return to the past. Young Hank reconciles with the present version of Best and asks him to find a way to make them forget who they are. During a game of pool with his older self, Bobby breaks down in the knowledge that he will be forced back into the closet when he returns to his original time. Iceman tries to reassure him that he will grow up to be someone awesome but younger Bobby admits that he quite likes the person he's become but the option to remain that person is no longer possible. Angel catches up to Archangel to say goodbye. Scott and Bloodstorm visit the adult Cyclops' grave and Scott comes to terms with the fact that he won't be a part of the future and that going back to their timeline is ensuring this. The X-Men meet in a Florida military base (the first place they became an official team in X-Men #1 in 1963) and resolve to tie up some loose ends. They destroy Mojo's new TV network, Scott says goodbye to Corsair and the Starjammers and recruit the Raksha as official X-Men who are to be trained by Danger and Polaris. At the X-Mansion, Jean and Scott finally give into their feelings and share a kiss. As they prepare to travel back in time, they see a news report that Magneto has formed a new Brotherhood and is attacking a nearby city so the X-Men resolve to stay in the present for just a little while longer.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #29-36</ref>\n\n== Team roster ==\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" style=\"margin:1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n!width=15%| Character\n!width=25%| Real name\n!width=30%| Joined in\n!width=30%| Notes\n|-\n|[[Jean Grey#Time-Displaced Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]]\n|Jean Grey\n| rowspan=\"5\" |''X-Men Blue'' #1 (April 2017)\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Displaced teenage versions from an unknown alternate reality.\n|-\n|[[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)#Time-Displaced Cyclops|Cyclops]]\n|Scott \"Slim\" Summers\n|-\n|[[Iceman (character)#Time-displaced Iceman|Iceman]]\n|Robert \"Bobby\" Drake\n|-\n|[[Beast (comics)#Time-Displaced Beast|Beast]]\n|Henry \"Hank\" McCoy\n|-\n|[[Warren Worthington III#Time-Displaced Warren Worthington III|Angel]]\n|Warren Worthington III\n|-\n|[[Jimmy Hudson|Poison]]\n|Jimmy Hudson\n|''X-Men Blue'' #5 (June 2017)\n|Wolverine's son from the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Marvel Universe]].

During the ensuing battle Jean ends up in telepathic contact with Miss Sinister, who takes a keen interest in her. After the battle ends they decide to bring Jimmy with them to join their team instead of sending him to the school with [[Kitty Pryde]] in order to better protect him and keep him under the radar. While exploring Madripoor during a festival on a night off, Jean, Beast and Jimmy confront a group of mutants, known as the Raksha, who were buying a chemical from a local dealer. Upon seeing Jimmy's claws the Raksha voluntarily end the fight, acknowledging the X-Men as allies due to everyone involved having a positive history with [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].<ref>''X-Men: Blue'' #4\u20136</ref>\n\n===Toil and Trobule===\nDuring the ''[[Secret Empire (comic book)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, the team rebels against the government of New Tian, located somewhere in [[California]], following [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]]'s takeover of the United States. While in their hideout, they're attacked by [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], [[Archangel (Marvel Comics)|Archangel]], [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]], [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]], [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], [[Mondo (comics)|Mondo]] and [[Toad (comics)|Toad]] who were sent by [[Emma Frost]]. Each of them exhibited much stronger abilities which Beast concludes is due to secondary mutations. While Jean and Jimmy escape, the rest of the team is captured. Emma then talks to Cyclops in his cell. As Jean and Jimmy regroup and plan their next move they are rescued by [[Danger Room#Sentience|Danger]], who stages a series of elaborate holograms to keep Emma's forces occupied. The rest of the team begins to lose hope as Emma begins telepathically tormenting Cyclops. Havok is about to intercept Jean and Jimmy when he is suddenly ambushed by [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris]]. While Polaris fights Havok, Jean and Jimmy manage to rescue their teammates and Briar until they're caught by Emma, who has upgraded her powers using a fragment of the [[Cosmic Cube]], allowing her to take control of Cyclops and force him to attack his teammates. Jean manages to release Cyclops from Emma's mental control and the team successfully escapes. Meanwhile, Magneto speaks with [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] about the team's recent actions and Emma and Havok meet with Miss Sinister and Bastion.<ref>''X-Men: Blue'' #7\u20139</ref>\n\nSometime later, it's revealed that Beast has learned his magic from the [[Goblin Queen]], who was using him to free a group of demons known as the Hex-Men who take the form of [[Pixie (comics)|Pixie]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Bloodstorm (Marvel Comics)|Bloodstorm]] and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] so that she may begin a dark ritual to summon her fellow Queens to take the world as their own. Danger trains Iceman and notes that he is distracted which could endanger the team during a fight because his boyfriend Romeo has stopped replying to his calls and messages. Jean and Scott find out that, when she released him from Emma's mind control, that a unique, unbreakable connection had formed between them meaning that they will always be able to read each other's minds. This initially causes some conflict as Jean discovers that Scott is jealous of her budding relationship with Jimmy. While trying to make sense of their new connection, the pair almost kiss but are interrupted by a massive explosion as the Golbin Queen begins her attack. The team confronts the Goblin Queen and the Hex-Men, seeing Beast transformed into a demonic creature.  During the battle, Jean and Scott manage to escape with help from the teleporting demon Pickles and enlist the aid of the Raksha. Back at the mansion, the Goblin Queen and the Hex-Men manage to capture the rest of the team and begin a ritual to summon the Goblin Queen's sisters. During the ritual, Jean, Scott and the Rashka infiltrate the mansion and battle the Goblin Queen's demons. Bloodstorm realises that the promises made to her by the Golbin Queen are false and that she will dispose of the Hex-Men once her sisters have been summoned so she betrays her and convinces Beast to break the Goblin Queen's hold on him and banish her to the hellish dimension where her sisters have been trapped. In the aftermath, Bloodstorm, is welcomed into the team despite her worries that she will massacre them as she did to the X-Men of her own reality.\n\nMeanwhile, Angel and Jimmy return to Colorado and join forces with Kira to investigate Jimmy's mysterious past only to discover a hidden lab where they find [[Blob (comics)|Blob]], who had been experimented on by Miss Sinister. When they enter, a special holographic message from Miss Sinister activates because it is attuned to Jimmy's genetic code but Angel turns it off before they can hear what she has to say because he believes she is trying to manipulate them. Angel, Kira and Jimmy battle Blob until he starts to melt as a side effect of the experiments and Angel vows to help him. They realise that the mutants that attacked them in New Tian must have been experimented on by Miss Sinister as well, meaning their powers were not because of secondary mutations. After finding the bodies of dead mutants, they theorise that the experiments, which Sinister refers to as \"Mothervine\" must be harmful to mutants, killing some but greatly powering up those who survive.<ref>''X-Men: Blue'' #10-12</ref>\n\n===\"Mojo Worldwide\"===\nWhen the team are invited to the Xavier Institue by Kitty, their reunion is interrupted by three floating objects that land in various areas of New York. The Blue and [[X-Men Gold|Gold]] teams join forces and split off into groups to investigate. When they come into contact with the objects, a powerful force fields surrounds them that they are unable to escape from. The force fields create virtual reality constructs of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]] and the [[Days of Future Past|Future]] that Rachel came from. Their clothing is transformed and the teams begin to fight off approaching enemies. It is revealed that [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]], in an effort to boost his ratings, is creating a special \"greatest hits\" show that recreates famous X-Men battles from throughout their history and that he is broadcasting it live to audiences across the multiverse.<ref>''X-Men Gold'' #12</ref> The first team, consisting of Kitty, Prestige, Cyclops and Bloodstorm, try to rescue civilians in the Future but they are interrupted by Mojo who broadcasts his face onto an army of [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]]. Proving to them that the threats they face are real and not simply special effects, impales Bloodstorm on a metal spear, killing her. Prestige used Scott and Jean\u2019s psychic connection to boost her own telepathy, enabling her to contact Logan, Storm, Angel and Iceman who are trapped in Asgard battling Frost Trolls and Nightcrawler, Colossus, Jimmy, Beast and Marvel Girl who are fighting demons in Inferno to tell them that Mojo is behind everything. The first team is rescued from the Sentinels by [[Longshot (Marvel Comics)|Longshot]], who has hacked into Mojo's system and is broadcasting his adventures to his own subscribers. Mojo becomes angry when he is informed that his ratings are not rising as quickly as he expected so he begins showering his audience with gifts and encourages them to vote on which scenario they would like to see the X-Men face using an app.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #13</ref>\n\nTransported to [[Asteroid M]], Longshot, Kitty, Prestige and Cyclops are forced to fight a simulation of Magneto. Scott then admits that the X-Men Blue have been working with Magneto and concludes that they never should have agreed as it is impossible for someone to change their behaviour so significantly. Meanwhile, Logan, Storm, Iceman and Angel are sent to the [[X-Tinction Agenda]] where they come under attack by the [[Magistrates (comics)|Magistrates]] and the [[Press Gang (comics)|Press Gang]] who swiftly kill the entire team. Meanwhile, Marvel Girl, Beast, Jimmy, Colossus and Nightcrawler are still fighting demons and are confronted by a simulation of the [[Goblin Queen]] who Jean manages to defeat, causing the team to be teleported to the [[Savage Land (comics)|Savage Land]].<ref>''X-Men Gold'' #13</ref> Mojo is delighted when [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris]], [[Danger (comics)|Danger]] and the real Magneto arrive to rescue the X-Men, sending them into the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlock tunnels]] to face the [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]. Longshot manages to teleport his team away from the Avengers.Still in the Savage land, Hank uses magic to fight off their enemies, much to the concern of Jean. Longshot and the others arrive and the survivng X-Men regroup before freeing the X-Men that had previously been \u201ckilled\u201d from stasis chambers on [[Mojo (comics)|Mojoworld]]. <ref>''X-Men Blue'' #14</ref>   Magneto, Polaris and Danger defeat Apocalypse but then come face-to-face with the [[Shi'ar]] and [[Krakoa]] although Danger manages to free them from the simulation. While the rest of the X-Men engage [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]] and Mojo's forces, Kitty finds out the location of Mojo's control room.<ref>''X-Men Gold'' #16</ref> The team reach the control room for their final showdown with Mojo, who leeches energy from his viewers to increase his strength. He appears to be getting the upper hand until Magento and Polaris arrive and combine their powers to create an EMP that disables his broadcasting technology, leaving him helpless. Kitty berates the young X-Men for working with Magneto and confronts Magneto about his actions but Colossus convinces her to stand down. After teleporting away, Mojo and his crew are stranded on Earth but manage to set up their own news network.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #15</ref>\n\n===\"Cross Time Capers\"===\nThe X-Men return to Magneto's mansion in Madripoor. Jean, concerned about Hank after he attempted to cast more spells, starts keeping an eye on him although Hank believes she is only hanging out with him in order to stay away from Scott, who she has started developing feelings for. Scott also tries to separate himself from Jean (even though their psychic rapport means the pair can never truly be alone) and grows closer to Bloodstorm, who he realises he has more in common with than he first thought. Bobby watches Mojo's new television show in which contestants attempt to survive a day being hunted by various creatures to win a cash prize. Polaris and Angel train Jimmy but they are interrupted when Polaris suddenly disappears. Sensing this, Jean and Hank rush to Mangeto who instructs her to read his mind. Jean discovers that Magneto has somehow been communicating with [[Professor Xavier]] from beyond the grave and, before disappearing, Magneto orders them into the labs underneath the mansion. The X-Men find out that Mangneto had been secretly building a time machine to send them back home and, believing they are to blame for the disappearances, Hank activates the machine in the hope that returning to their original time will fix the timestream. The machine mistakenly sends the team to [[X-Men 2099|2099]] where they are confronted by the X-Men of that timeline. Hank explains that he believes something has happened in their original time and, because the X-Men were not there to stop it, ripples through time are erasing people from existence. They find out 2099 is a dystopian future where the original five X-Men have destroyed the planet and leave most people to starve and die. Horrified, Hank and the team travel to another time in the hope of rewriting history so that this future will never happen. The device sends them to the wrong time period again and the X-Men are forced to battle the students of [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]] but the battle is interrupted by the student's teachers [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] and Emma Frost, who reveal that the original X-Men turned on them and decimated any attempts at resistance. Hank finally manages to teleport the team back to their original time.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #16-18</ref>\n\nIn the past, due to the absence of the X-Men when they travelled to the future, evil versions of the original X-Men from an alternate reality lead by Professor X took their place and killed Magneto using a nuclear missile. That time's original Xavier is kept hooked up to Cerebro but somehow managed to send a message through time to Magneto in the present asking for help. Hank manages to rescue Magneto just before his death and he reluctantly teams up with the X-Men. It is revealed that the evil X-Men are actually the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] who were last encountered by the team during the [[Battle of the Atom]] storyline. The teams engage each other in combat, with Beast teleporting in the 2099 X-Men and Generation X while Jean locates and rescues their Professor X from Cerebro. The Brotherhood jump back into the timestream before they can be apprehended and the X-Men have a tearful reunion with their Xavier, who explains that there is still things they must do before they can stay in their time, noting that when they do return for good, it must be from the exact moment in which they left. Sending them back to the present, the X-Men find that Magneto and the others have returned with no memory of what has happened, although Bobby quickly fills him in. The X-Men are disheartened that they must eventually return to the original time, with Bobby particularly upset that all of their growth as people will be undone. Magneto finds the Brotherhood in the timestream and kills them for what they have done.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #19-20</ref>\n\n===\"Poison X\"===\nDuring Scott's video call between Scott and his father [[Corsair (comics)|Corsair]], he and the rest of the [[Starjammers]] are attacked by people wearing [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiotes]]. Before the call cuts off, Corsair shouts some co-ordinates to Scott which are also heard by Jean via their psychic rapport. Hoping to find answers, the X-Men intercept [[Venom (Eddie Brock)|Venom]] during one of his missions. While Eddie Brock refuses to go with the X-Men, his Venom symbiote wants to learn more about what is going on and puts him to sleep so that the X-Men can question him. They locate the Strarjammer's ship and are greeted by [[Sikorsky (comics)|Sikorsky]], who hid during the attack and explains more about the symbiotes that were responsible. Fearful of the damager they can do, Venom agrees to help the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' Annual #1</ref> After barely surviving an encounter with some of the symbiotes, Scott is badly wounded an the X-Men retreat while Venom manages to track down the arms dealer responsible for selling the symbiotes however, once inside, a battle ensues causing some of the symbiotes to bond with the X-Men. The team board the ship of the symbiote-wearing bounty hunters who have been holding the Starjammers hostage and incapacitate them, enabling Scott to free his father. Jean's psychic link is suddenly severed and it is revealed that Poisons, special symbiotes that completely take over a host and turn them into a weapon, have boarded the ship and bonded with her, killing her.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #21-22</ref>\n\n===\"Cry Havok\"===\nMagneto discovers that Emma Frost and the Hellfire Club are planning something and heads to their mansion to investigate, coming face to face with [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] whose powers have been augmented by Miss Sinister. Although they pretend to be in league with Miss Sinister and [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]] (who are planning to use their combined technology to cause an increase in the mutant population), Havok and Emma Frost privately conspire to double cross them when the moment arises. [[Malice (comics)|Malice]] is revealed to have possessed Polaris and, although she manages to break free, Malice has already gravely injured the Raksha leaving only one, Gazing Nightshade, unharmed. Jimmy and Bloodstorm rescue [[Xorn (comics)|Xorn]] from a group of [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] and regroup with Polaris, Gazing Nightshade and new recruit [[Daken]] to form a new team of X-Men. Mangeto meets with Miss Sinister, Bastion, Havok and Emma and tries to convince them to reconsider their actions but they refuse and defeat him. The group unleash their technology and mutants all over the world begin to develop new mutations that they are unable to control. Miss Sinister reveals that their technology also takes away their free will, allowing her to control them and, while Emma is taken aback, Havok explains that he knew all along and supports her plan. The X-Men do battle with the mutants and are captured while Magneto flees and meets with [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] and [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]] who help him to heal the new mutants. Emma turns on Sinister and frees Jimmy, who kills Sinister, before releasing the rest of the X-Men. Xorn sacrifices himself to kill Bastion and Polaris, with Emma's help, breaks through to Havok and makes him see the error of his ways. Emma meets with Magneto, who vows to destroy her for what she has done. In the depths of space, a traumatised Cyclops is unable to come to terms with Jean's death and, despite having some difficulty, Beast manages to fly their ship back home.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #23-28</ref>\n\n===\"Surviving the Experience\"===\nFollowing an invasion of Earth by the Poisons, which results and Jean being resurrected, the X-Men search for Jimmy, who was taken over by one of the last surviving Poisons.<ref>''Venomized'' #5</ref> They track him to the woods where they try to break through to Jimmy and encourage him to fight against the Poison which is controlling him but they are interrupted by Daken who announces that he has been sent by Magneto to assassinate Jimmy. Jean lets Jimmy go off to find himself. Searching for Emma, Magneto attacks several Hellfire Club parties and kills everyone in attendance. The X-Men investigate, shocked that Magneto is capable of such things but Bloodstorm explains that, while the X-Men were in space, Magneto was forced to kill some of the mind-controlled mutants he had sworn to protect and that he is now seeking revenge on those that caused it. The X-Men track Emma to France and offer to help protect her from Magneto, who subsequently attacks with powers enhanced using mutant growth hormone. After they help Emma escape, it becomes clear that Magneto is too powerful for the X-Men and, not wanting to kill the team he had mentored, Magneto leaves. Jean meets with her adult self and the two speak about their various resurrections. The younger Jean expresses her wish that they would have had more time to get to know one another but that the time-displaced X-Men must return to their original time soon. She expresses her sadness that their minds must all be erased of their experiences in the present so that they do not change things when they return to the past. Young Hank reconciles with the present version of Best and asks him to find a way to make them forget who they are. During a game of pool with his older self, Bobby breaks down in the knowledge that he will be forced back into the closet when he returns to his original time. Iceman tries to reassure him that he will grow up to be someone awesome but younger Bobby admits that he quite likes the person he's become but the option to remain that person is no longer possible. Angel catches up to Archangel to say goodbye. Scott and Bloodstorm visit the adult Cyclops' grave and Scott comes to terms with the fact that he won't be a part of the future and that going back to their timeline is ensuring this. The X-Men meet in a Florida military base (the first place they became an official team in X-Men #1 in 1963) and resolve to tie up some loose ends. They destroy Mojo's new TV network, Scott says goodbye to Corsair and the Starjammers and recruit the Raksha as official X-Men who are to be trained by Danger and Polaris. At the X-Mansion, Jean and Scott finally give into their feelings and share a kiss. As they prepare to travel back in time, they see a news report that Magneto has formed a new Brotherhood and is attacking a nearby city so the X-Men resolve to stay in the present for just a little while longer.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #29-36</ref>\n\n== Team roster ==\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" style=\"margin:1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n!width=15%| Character\n!width=25%| Real name\n!width=30%| Joined in\n!width=30%| Notes\n|-\n|[[Jean Grey#Time-Displaced Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]]\n|Jean Grey\n| rowspan=\"5\" |''X-Men Blue'' #1 (April 2017)\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Displaced teenage versions from an unknown alternate reality.\n|-\n|[[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)#Time-Displaced Cyclops|Cyclops]]\n|Scott \"Slim\" Summers\n|-\n|[[Iceman (character)#Time-displaced Iceman|Iceman]]\n|Robert \"Bobby\" Drake\n|-\n|[[Beast (comics)#Time-Displaced Beast|Beast]]\n|Henry \"Hank\" McCoy\n|-\n|[[Warren Worthington III#Time-Displaced Warren Worthington III|Angel]]\n|Warren Worthington III\n|-\n|[[Jimmy Hudson|Poison]]\n|Jimmy Hudson\n|''X-Men Blue'' #5 (June 2017)\n|Wolverine's son from the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Marvel Universe]].

The show is set in the fictional town of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] and parodies [[Culture of the United States|American culture]] and [[Society of the United States|society]], television, and the [[human condition]].\n\nThe family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of [[The Simpsons shorts|animated shorts]] with producer [[James L. Brooks]]. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after his own family members, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' on April 19, 1987. After three seasons, the sketch was developed into a half-hour [[prime time]] show and became Fox's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989\u201390).\n\nSince its debut on December 17, 1989, [[List of The Simpsons episodes|{{Template parameter value|The Simpsons|Infobox television||num_episodes}} episodes]] of ''The Simpsons'' have been broadcast. It is the [[List of longest-running U.S. primetime television series|longest-running]] American sitcom, and the [[List of longest-running scripted U.S. primetime television series|longest-running American scripted primetime television series]], both in terms of seasons and number of episodes. ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', a feature-length film, was released in theaters worldwide on July 27, 2007, and grossed over $527&nbsp;million. Then on October 30, 2007, [[The Simpsons Game|a video game]] was released.

A number of them have gained expanded roles and subsequently starred in their own episodes. According to Matt Groening, the show adopted the concept of a large supporting cast from the comedy show ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]''.<ref name=\"avclub1\">{{cite news |url=https://www.avclub.com/articles/matt-groening,13984/ |title=Matt Groening: Interview |accessdate=October 22, 2006 |author=Rabin, Nathan |date=April 26, 2006 |newspaper=The A.V. Club |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119014837/http://www.avclub.com/articles/matt-groening,13984/ |archive-date=January 19, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Continuity and the floating timeline===\nDespite the depiction of yearly milestones such as holidays or birthdays passing, the characters do not age between episodes (either physically or in stated age), and generally appear just as they did when the series began. The series uses a [[floating timeline]] in which episodes generally take place in the year the episode is produced even though the characters do not age. Flashbacks and flashforwards do occasionally depict the characters at other points in their lives, with the timeline of these depictions also generally floating relative to the year the episode is produced. For example, in the 1991 episode \"[[I Married Marge]]\", Bart (who is always 10 years old) appears to be born in 1980 or 1981. But in the 1995 episode \"[[And Maggie Makes Three]]\", Maggie (who always appears to be around 1 year old) appears to be born in 1993 or 1994. In the 1992 episode \"[[Lisa's First Word]]\", Lisa (who is always 8) is shown to have been born in 1984.\n\nA canon of the show does exist, although ''[[Treehouse of Horror]]'' episodes and any fictional story told within the series are typically non-canon. However, continuity is inconsistent and limited in ''The Simpsons''. For example, [[Krusty the Clown]] may be able to read in one episode, but may not be able to read in another. Lessons learned by the family in one episode may be forgotten in the next.

The show is set in the fictional town of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] and parodies [[Culture of the United States|American culture]] and [[Society of the United States|society]], television, and the [[human condition]].\n\nThe family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of [[The Simpsons shorts|animated shorts]] with producer [[James L. Brooks]]. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after his own family members, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' on April 19, 1987. After three seasons, the sketch was developed into a half-hour [[prime time]] show and became Fox's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989\u201390).\n\nSince its debut on December 17, 1989, [[List of The Simpsons episodes|{{Template parameter value|The Simpsons|Infobox television||num_episodes}} episodes]] of ''The Simpsons'' have been broadcast. It is the [[List of longest-running U.S. primetime television series|longest-running]] American sitcom, and the [[List of longest-running scripted U.S. primetime television series|longest-running American scripted primetime television series]], both in terms of seasons and number of episodes. ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', a feature-length film, was released in theaters worldwide on July 27, 2007, and grossed over $527&nbsp;million. Then on October 30, 2007, [[The Simpsons Game|a video game]] was released. ''The Simpsons'' was renewed on February 6, 2019 for a thirty-first and thirty-second season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/the-simpsons-renewed-season-31-32-fox-1203130108/|title='The Simpsons' Renewed for Season 31 and 32 at Fox|last1=Otterson|first1=Joe|date=February 6, 2019|website=Variety.com|publisher=Variety Media, LLC.|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190206231513/https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/the-simpsons-renewed-season-31-32-fox-1203130108/|archive-date=February 6, 2019|accessdate=6 February 2019}}</ref> The former began airing September 29, 2019 and will conclude in May 17, 2020, and the latter of which will contain the 700th episode.

It has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, including 34 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, 34 [[Annie Award]]s, and a [[Peabody Award]]. Homer's exclamatory catchphrase \"[[D'oh!]]\" has been adopted into the English language, while ''The Simpsons'' has influenced many other later adult-oriented animated sitcoms.<!--The impending Futurama/Family Guy crossovers are mentioned in the 'Influence on TV' section.

A number of them have gained expanded roles and subsequently starred in their own episodes. According to Matt Groening, the show adopted the concept of a large supporting cast from the comedy show ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]''.<ref name=\"avclub1\">{{cite news |url=https://www.avclub.com/articles/matt-groening,13984/ |title=Matt Groening: Interview |accessdate=October 22, 2006 |author=Rabin, Nathan |date=April 26, 2006 |newspaper=The A.V. Club |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119014837/http://www.avclub.com/articles/matt-groening,13984/ |archive-date=January 19, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Continuity and the floating timeline===\nDespite the depiction of yearly milestones such as holidays or birthdays passing, the characters do not age between episodes (either physically or in stated age), and generally appear just as they did when the series began. The series uses a [[floating timeline]] in which episodes generally take place in the year the episode is produced even though the characters do not age. Flashbacks and flashforwards do occasionally depict the characters at other points in their lives, with the timeline of these depictions also generally floating relative to the year the episode is produced. For example, in the 1991 episode \"[[I Married Marge]]\", Bart (who is always 10 years old) appears to be born in 1980 or 1981. But in the 1995 episode \"[[And Maggie Makes Three]]\", Maggie (who always appears to be around 1 year old) appears to be born in 1993 or 1994. In the 1992 episode \"[[Lisa's First Word]]\", Lisa (who is always 8) is shown to have been born in 1984.\n\nA canon of the show does exist, although ''[[Treehouse of Horror]]'' episodes and any fictional story told within the series are typically non-canon. However, continuity is inconsistent and limited in ''The Simpsons''. For example, [[Krusty the Clown]] may be able to read in one episode, but may not be able to read in another. Lessons learned by the family in one episode may be forgotten in the next.

The Wolff rearrangement yields a ketene as an intermediate product, which can undergo nucleophilic attack with [[weak acids|weakly acidic]] [[nucleophiles]] such as [[water]], [[alcohols]], and [[amines]], to generate [[carbonyl#carboxylic acid derivatives|carboxylic acid derivatives]] or undergo [[2+2 Photocycloaddition|[2+2] cycloaddition]] reactions to form four-membered rings.<ref name=\"Kirmse\">{{cite journal|author=Kirmse, W. |journal=Eur.

The Wolff rearrangement has been used in many [[total synthesis|total syntheses]]; the most common use is trapping the ketene intermediate with nucleophiles to form carboxylic acid derivatives.  The [[Arndt-Eistert reaction|Arndt-Eistert homologation]] is a specific example of this use, wherein a [[carboxylic acid]] may be elongated by a methylene unit.  Another common use is in [[Ring expansion and ring contraction|ring-contraction]] methods; if the \u03b1-diazo ketone is [[cyclic compound|cyclic]], the Wolff rearrangement results in a ring-contracted product.  The Wolff rearrangement works well in generating ring-strained systems, where other reactions may fail.\n\n==History==\nIn 1902, Wolff discovered that treating diazoacetophenone with silver (I) oxide and water resulted in formation of [[phenylacetic acid]].  Similarly, treatment with silver (I) oxide and [[ammonia]] formed phenylacetamide.<ref name=\"Wolff\"/>  A few years later, in an independent study, Schr\u00f6ter observed similar results.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Chem.

First, \u03b1-diazocarbonyl compounds are in an equilibrium of s-''cis'' and s-''trans''-conformers, the distribution of which may influence the mechanism of the reaction.  Generally, under photolysis, compounds in the s-''cis'' conformation react in a concerted manner due to the [[antiperiplanar]] relationship between the leaving and migrating groups, whereas compounds in the s-''trans'' conformation react stepwise through a carbene intermediate or do not rearrange.  Second, regardless of the reaction mechanism, the rearrangement gives a ketene intermediate, which can be trapped by a weakly acidic nucleophile, such as an [[alcohol]] or [[amine]], to give the corresponding ester or amide, or an olefin, to give a [2+2] cycloaddition adduct.  [[Strong acids]] do not rearrange, but rather protonate the \u03b1-carbon and give [[SN2 reaction|S<sub>N</sub>2]] products. \n \n[[File:WolffF4final.png|center|600px|Concerted versus stepwise mechanism for ground state conformers.]]\n\n===Stereochemistry of \u03b1-diazo ketones===\nUnderstanding the stereochemistry of \u03b1-diazo ketones is essential in elucidating the mechanism of the Wolff rearrangement.  \u03b1-diazocarbonyl compounds are generally locally planar, with large rotational barriers (55\u201365 kJ/mol) due to C-C olefin character between the [[carbonyl]] and [[Alpha-carbon|\u03b1-carbon]], illustrated in the rightmost resonance structure.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Pecile, C. Foffani, F. Chersetti, S. |journal=Tetrahedron|year=1964|volume=20|pages= 823\u2013829|doi=10.1016/S0040-4020(01)98414-5|title=The interaction of diazocarbonyl compounds with hydroxylic solvents|issue=4}}</ref>  Such a large barrier slows molecular rotations sufficiently to lead to an equilibrium between two conformers, an s-''trans'' and s-''cis''-conformer. s-''cis''-Conformers are electronically favored due to [[Coulombic attraction]] between the oxygen with a partial negative charge and the cationic nitrogen, as seen in the rightmost resonance structure.<ref name=\"Kirmse\"/>  If R<sub>1</sub> is large and R<sub>2</sub> is hydrogen, s-''cis'' is sterically favored.  If R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> are large, s-''trans'' is sterically favored; if both substituents are sufficiently large, the steric repulsion can outweigh the Coulombic attraction, leading to a preference for s-''trans''.  Small and medium cyclic substrates are constrained in the s-''cis'' conformation. \n \n[[File:WolffF5final.png|center|500px|Equilibrium between s-''trans'' and s-''cis'' with resonance structure showing the olefinic character of the C-C bond, and the Coulombic attraction in s-''cis''.]]\n\n===Concerted mechanism===\nWhen the \u03b1-diazo ketone is in the s-''cis'' conformation, the leaving group (N<sub>2</sub>) and the migrating group (R<sub>1</sub>) are antiperiplanar, which favors a concerted mechanism, in which nitrogen extrusion occurs concurrently with 1,2-alkyl shift.  There is evidence this mechanism occurs in both thermolytic and photolytic methods, when the s-''cis''-conformer is strongly favored.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kaplan, F. Meloy, G. K. |journal=J. Am.

The stepwise mechanism begins with nitrogen extrusion, forming an \u03b1-ketocarbene.  The \u03b1-ketocarbene can either undergo a 1,2-alkyl shift, to give the ketene product, or can undergo a 4\u03c0 electrocyclic ring closure, to form an [[antiaromatic]] oxirene.  This oxirene can reopen in two ways, to either \u03b1-ketocarbene, which can then form the ketene product.\n\n[[File:WolffF7final.png|center|750px|Stepwise mechanism from the s-''trans''-conformation with sequential extrusion of nitrogen to give the ketocarbene, which can either undergo 1,2-alkyl shift to form the carbene or 4\u03c0 electrocyclic ring closure to give an oxirene intermediate.]]\n\nThere are two primary arguments for stepwise mechanisms.  The first is that [[reaction rate constant|rate constants]] of Wolff rearrangements depend on the stability of the formed carbene, rather than the migratory aptitude of the migrating group.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Regitz, M. W, Bartz. |journal=Chem. Ber.|year=1970|volume=103|pages= 1477\u20131485|doi=10.1002/cber.19701030519|title=Untersuchungen an Diazoverbindungen, VII. Vergleichende kinetische Untersuchungen zur thermischen Stabilit\u00e4t aliphatischer Diazoverbindungen|issue=5}}</ref>  The most definitive evidence is isotopic scrambling of the ketene, as predicted by an oxirene intermediate, which can only occur in the stepwise path.  In the scheme below, the red carbon is <sup>13</sup>C labelled. The symmetric oxirene intermediate can open either way, scrambling the <sup>13</sup>C label.  If the substituents R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> are the same, one can quantify the ratio of products stemming from the concerted and stepwise mechanisms; if the substituents are different, the oxirene will have a preference in the direction it opens, and a ratio cannot be quantified, but any scrambling indicates some reactant is going through a stepwise mechanism.<ref name=\"Kirmse\"/>  In photolysis of diazo acetaldehyde, 8% of the label is scrambled, indicating that 16% of product is formed via the oxirene intermediate.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Zeller, K.

Role of oxirene in the photolysis of .alpha.-diazo ketones and ketenes}}</ref>  These studies confirm that reactants that prefer s-''trans'' conformations tend to undergo stepwise reaction.  The degree of scrambling is also affected by carbene stability, migratory abilities, and nucleophilicity of solvent.  The observation that the migratory ability of a substituent is inversely proportional to amount of carbene formed, indicates that under photolysis, there are competing pathways for many Wolff reactions.<ref name=\"Fenwick\"/> The only Wolff rearrangements that show no scrambling are s-''cis'' constrained cyclic \u03b1-diazo ketones.<ref name=\"Timm\">{{cite journal|author=Timm, U.

Many mechanistic studies have been carried out, including conformational, sensitization, kinetic, and isotopic scrambling studies.  These all point to competing mechanisms, with general trends.  \u03b1-Diazo ketones that exist in the s-''cis'' conformation generally undergo a concerted mechanism, whereas those in the s-''trans'' conformation undergo a stepwise mechanism.<ref name=\"Kirmse\"/>  \u03b1-diazo ketones with better migratory groups prefer a concerted mechanism.<ref name=\"Kirmse\"/>  However, for all substrates except cyclic \u03b1-diazo ketones that exist solely in the s-''cis'' conformation, products come from a combination of both pathways.<ref name=\"Kirmse\"/>  Transition metal mediated reactions are quite varied; however, they generally prefer forming the metal carbene intermediate.<ref name=\"Gill\"/>  The complete mechanism under photolysis can be approximated in the following figure:\n\n[[File:WolffF9final.png|center|600px|Mechanistic landscape of the Wolff-rearrangement, with the concerted mechanism on the top and stepwise mechanism with carbene and oxirene intermediates on the bottom.]]\n\n===Migratory trends===\nThe mechanism of the Wolff rearrangement is dependent on the aptitude of the migratory group.

These reactions are generally run in the presence of a weak base, such as [[sodium carbonate]] or tertiary amines.<ref name=\"Gill\"/>\n\nWhereas thermal and metal mediated Wolff rearrangements date back to 1902,<ref name=\"Wolff\"/> photolytic methods are somewhat newer, with the first example of a photolytic Wolff rearrangement reported in 1951.<ref name=\"Horner\"/> \u03b1-diazo ketones have two absorption bands, an allowed \u03c0\u2192\u03c0* transition at 240\u2013270&nbsp;nm, and a formally forbidden \u03c0\u2192\u03c3* transition at 270\u2013310&nbsp;nm.<ref name=\"Horner\"/> Medium or low-pressure [[mercury arc lamp]]s can excite these respective transitions.

A carboxylic acid derivative with an \u03b1-methylene group is a retron for an Arndt-Eistert type homologation.  An acid in which the \u03b1-carbon belongs to a ring is a retron for a Wolff rearrangement ring contraction.\n\n[[File:WolffF2final.png|center|400px|Wolff Retrons]]\n\n===Homologation reactions===\nIn the Arndt-Eistert homologation reaction, a carboxylic acid and [[thionyl chloride]] are reacted to generate an acid chloride.  The acid chloride then reacts with diazomethane (R<sub>2</sub> = H), or occasionally a diazoalkyl, via the Arndt-Eistert procedure, to generate an \u03b1-diazo ketone, which will undergo a metal-catalyzed or photolyzed Wolff rearrangement, to give a ketene.  The ketene can be trapped with any weak acid, such as an alcohol or amine, to form the ester or amide.  However, trapping with water, to form the acid is the most common form. \n \n[[File:WolffF17final.png|center|600px|General homologation reaction, Arndt-Eistert has R<sub>2</sub> = H, RXH=H<sub>2</sub>O]]\n\nIn the most basic form, where R<sub>2</sub>= H, RXH=H<sub>2</sub>O, the reaction lengthens the alkyl chain of a carboxylic acid by a methylene.  However, there is great synthetic utility in the variety of reactions one can carry out, by varying the diazoalkyl and weak acid.  The migrating group, R<sub>1</sub> migrates with complete retention.<ref name=\"Gill\"/> A very useful application of the Arndt-Eistert homologation forms the homologated [[aldehyde]] by either trapping the ketene with N-methyl aniline and [[redox|reducing]] with [[lithium aluminum hydride]], or trapping the ketene with [[ethanethiol]] and reducing with [[Raney nickel]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Weygand, F.

The Wolff rearrangement has been used in many [[total synthesis|total syntheses]]; the most common use is trapping the ketene intermediate with nucleophiles to form carboxylic acid derivatives.  The [[Arndt-Eistert reaction|Arndt-Eistert homologation]] is a specific example of this use, wherein a [[carboxylic acid]] may be elongated by a methylene unit.  Another common use is in [[Ring expansion and ring contraction|ring-contraction]] methods; if the \u03b1-diazo ketone is [[cyclic compound|cyclic]], the Wolff rearrangement results in a ring-contracted product.

First, \u03b1-diazocarbonyl compounds are in an equilibrium of s-''cis'' and s-''trans''-conformers, the distribution of which may influence the mechanism of the reaction.  Generally, under photolysis, compounds in the s-''cis'' conformation react in a concerted manner due to the [[antiperiplanar]] relationship between the leaving and migrating groups, whereas compounds in the s-''trans'' conformation react stepwise through a carbene intermediate or do not rearrange.  Second, regardless of the reaction mechanism, the rearrangement gives a ketene intermediate, which can be trapped by a weakly acidic nucleophile, such as an [[alcohol]] or [[amine]], to give the corresponding ester or amide, or an olefin, to give a [2+2] cycloaddition adduct.  [[Strong acids]] do not rearrange, but rather protonate the \u03b1-carbon and give [[SN2 reaction|S<sub>N</sub>2]] products. \n \n[[File:WolffF4final.png|center|600px|Concerted versus stepwise mechanism for ground state conformers.]]\n\n===Stereochemistry of \u03b1-diazo ketones===\nUnderstanding the stereochemistry of \u03b1-diazo ketones is essential in elucidating the mechanism of the Wolff rearrangement.  \u03b1-diazocarbonyl compounds are generally locally planar, with large rotational barriers (55\u201365 kJ/mol) due to C-C olefin character between the [[carbonyl]] and [[Alpha-carbon|\u03b1-carbon]], illustrated in the rightmost resonance structure.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Pecile, C. Foffani, F. Chersetti, S. |journal=Tetrahedron|year=1964|volume=20|pages= 823\u2013829|doi=10.1016/S0040-4020(01)98414-5|title=The interaction of diazocarbonyl compounds with hydroxylic solvents|issue=4}}</ref>  Such a large barrier slows molecular rotations sufficiently to lead to an equilibrium between two conformers, an s-''trans'' and s-''cis''-conformer. s-''cis''-Conformers are electronically favored due to [[Coulombic attraction]] between the oxygen with a partial negative charge and the cationic nitrogen, as seen in the rightmost resonance structure.<ref name=\"Kirmse\"/>  If R<sub>1</sub> is large and R<sub>2</sub> is hydrogen, s-''cis'' is sterically favored.  If R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> are large, s-''trans'' is sterically favored; if both substitents are sufficiently large, the steric repulsion can outweigh the Coulombic attraction, leading to a preference for s-''trans''.  Small and medium cyclic substrates are constrained in the s-''cis'' conformation. \n \n[[File:WolffF5final.png|center|500px|Equilibrium between s-''trans'' and s-''cis'' with resonance structure showing the olefinic character of the C-C bond, and the Coulombic attraction in s-''cis''.]]\n\n===Concerted mechanism===\nWhen the \u03b1-diazo ketone is in the s-''cis'' conformation, the leaving group (N<sub>2</sub>) and the migrating group (R<sub>1</sub>) are antiperiplanar, which favors a concerted mechanism, in which nitrogen extrusion occurs concurrently with 1,2-alkyl shift.

The stepwise mechanism begins with nitrogen extrusion, forming an \u03b1-ketocarbene.  The \u03b1-ketocarbene can either undergo a 1,2-alkyl shift, to give the ketene product, or can undergo a 4\u03c0 electrocyclic ring closure, to form an [[antiaromatic]] oxirene.  This oxirene can reopen in two ways, to either \u03b1-ketocarbene, which can then form the ketene product.\n\n[[File:WolffF7final.png|center|750px|Stepwise mechanism from the s-''trans''-conformation with sequential extrusion of nitrogen to give the ketocarbene, which can either undergo 1,2-alkyl shift to form the carbene or 4\u03c0 electrocyclic ring closure to give an oxirene intermediate.]]\n\nThere are two primary arguments for stepwise mechanisms.

In addition, S<sub>N</sub>2 substitution of the diazo group at the \u03b1-carbon can take place at lower temperatures than rearrangement, which results in byproducts.  The greatest use of thermal Wolff rearrangements is the formation of carboxylic acid analogs, by interception of the ketene with high boiling solvents, such as [[aniline]] and [[phenol]].<ref name=\"Wolff\"/>\n\nTransition metals greatly lower the temperature of Wolff rearrangements, by stabilization of a [[Transition metal carbene complex|metal-carbene]] intermediate.  However, these carbenes can be so stable, as to not undergo rearrangement.  Carbenes of [[rhodium]], [[copper]], and [[palladium]] are too stable and give non-Wolff products (primarily [[Carbene C\u2212H insertion|carbene insertion]] products).<ref name=\"Gill\"/>  The most commonly used metal catalyst is silver(I) oxide, although silver benzoate is also common.  These reactions are generally run in the presence of a weak base, such as [[sodium carbonate]] or tertiary amines.<ref name=\"Gill\"/>\n\nWhereas thermal and metal mediated Wolff rearrangements date back to 1902,<ref name=\"Wolff\"/> photolytic methods are somewhat newer, with the first example of a photolytic Wolff rearrangement reported in 1951.<ref name=\"Horner\"/> \u03b1-diazo ketones have two absorption bands, an allowed \u03c0\u2192\u03c0* transition at 240\u2013270&nbsp;nm, and a formally forbidden \u03c0\u2192\u03c3* transition at 270\u2013310&nbsp;nm.<ref name=\"Horner\"/> Medium or low-pressure [[mercury arc lamp]]s can excite these respective transitions. Triplet sensitizers result in non-Wolff carbene byproducts, and thus are not useful in synthetic applications of the Wolff rearrangement.<ref name=\"Gill\"/> However, they have been used to probe the mechanism of the Wolff rearrangement.\n\n==Synthetic uses==\nThe Wolff rearrangement has a few [[retrosynthetic analysis|retrons]], depending on the reaction out of the ketene intermediate.  A carboxylic acid derivative with an \u03b1-methylene group is a retron for an Arndt-Eistert type homologation.  An acid in which the \u03b1-carbon belongs to a ring is a retron for a Wolff rearrangement ring contraction.\n\n[[File:WolffF2final.png|center|400px|Wolff Retrons]]\n\n===Homologation reactions===\nIn the Arndt-Eistert homologation reaction, a carboxylic acid and [[thionyl chloride]] are reacted to generate an acid chloride.  The acid chloride then reacts with diazomethane (R<sub>2</sub> = H), or occasionally a diazoalkyl, via the Arndt-Eistert procedure, to generate an \u03b1-diazo ketone, which will undergo a metal-catalyzed or photolyzed Wolff rearrangement, to give a ketene.  The ketene can be trapped with any weak acid, such as an alcohol or amine, to form the ester or amide.  However, trapping with water, to form the acid is the most common form. \n \n[[File:WolffF17final.png|center|600px|General homologation reaction, Arndt-Eistert has R<sub>2</sub> = H, RXH=H<sub>2</sub>O]]\n\nIn the most basic form, where R<sub>2</sub>= H, RXH=H<sub>2</sub>O, the reaction lengthens the alkyl chain of a carboxylic acid by a methylene.  However, there is great synthetic utility in the variety of reactions one can carry out, by varying the diazoalkyl and weak acid.  The migrating group, R<sub>1</sub> migrates with complete retention.<ref name=\"Gill\"/> A very useful application of the Arndt-Eistert homologation forms the homologated [[aldehyde]] by either trapping the ketene with N-methyl aniline and [[redox|reducing]] with [[lithium aluminum hydride]], or trapping the ketene with [[ethanethiol]] and reducing with [[Raney nickel]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Weygand, F.
