The objective is to [[Obfuscation|conceal the words]] from others not familiar with the rules. The reference to [[Latin language|Latin]] is a deliberate [[misnomer]]; Pig Latin is simply a form of [[argot]] or [[jargon]] unrelated to Latin, and the name is used for its English connotations as a strange and foreign-sounding language. It is most often used by young children as a fun way to confuse people unfamiliar with Pig Latin.\n\n==Origins and history==\nEarly mentions of pig Latin or hog Latin describe what we would today call [[dog Latin]], a type of parody Latin.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Examples of this predate even [[Shakespeare]], whose 1598 play, ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'', includes a reference to dog Latin:<ref>{{cite web | website=The Straight Dope | url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2163/whats-the-origin-of-pig-latin | title=What's the origin of pig Latin? | access-date=2016-01-28 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204224225/http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2163/whats-the-origin-of-pig-latin | archive-date=2016-02-04 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n{{quote|'''Costard:''' Go to; thou hast it ad dungill, at the fingers' ends, as they say.<br>\n'''Holofernes:''' O, I smell false Latine; dunghill for unguem. | ''Love's Labour's Lost'', William Shakespeare}}\n\nAn 1866 article describes a \"hog latin\" that has some similarities to current Pig Latin.

'Hoggibus, Piggibus et shotam damnabile grunto,' and all that sort of thing,\" although the jargon is dog Latin.\n\n''[[The Atlantic]]'' January 1895 also included a mention of the subject: \"They all spoke a queer jargon which they themselves had invented. It was something like the well-known 'pig Latin' that all sorts of children like to play with.\"\n\nThe modern version of Pig Latin appears in a 1919 [[Columbia Records]] album containing what sounds like the modern variation, by a singer named [[Arthur Fields]]. The song, called [https://archive.org/details/PigLatinLove Pig Latin Love], is followed by the subtitle \"I-Yay Ove-Lay oo-yay earie-day\".<ref>'''I Always Wondered:''' [http://ialwayswondered.jarrettgreen.com/2011/05/25/where-did-pig-latin-come-from/ Where did Pig Latin come from?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129214016/http://ialwayswondered.jarrettgreen.com/2011/05/25/where-did-pig-latin-come-from/ |date=2016-01-29 }}<br/>The consensus seems to be that the version of Pig Latin we know today, was born sometime in the 20th century. In 1919 Columbia records released an album with Arthur Fields singing \u201cPig Latin Love\u201d. The Subtitle \u201cI-Yay Ove-Lay oo-yay earie-day\u201d indicates that this is the modern form of Pig Latin we recognize today. I was able to scrounge up a photograph of the 1919 sheet music on eBay. Below the Pig Latin subtitle is the translation, \u201c(I love you dearie)\u201d, suggesting that perhaps this form of Pig Latin hadn\u2019t taken root among the general public yet.</ref> [[The Three Stooges]] used it on multiple occasions, most notably ''[[Tassels in the Air]]'', a 1938 short where [[Moe Howard]] attempts to teach [[Curley Howard]] how to use it, thereby conveying the rules to the audience. In an earlier (1934) episode, ''[[Three Little Pigskins]]'', [[Larry Fine]] attempts to impress a woman with his skill in Pig Latin, but it turns out that she knows it, too. No explanation of the rules is given.  A few months prior in 1934, in the ''[[Our Gang]]'' [[short film]] ''[[Washee Ironee]]'', Spanky tries to speak to an Asian boy by using Pig Latin.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcMWkY-Wlkk#t=10m35s |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-03-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126140403/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcMWkY-Wlkk#t=10m35s |archive-date=2016-11-26 |url-status=live }}</ref>  [[Ginger Rogers]] sang a verse of [[We're in the Money]] in pig Latin in an elaborate [[Busby Berkeley]] production number in the film [[Gold Diggers of 1933]],  ({{cite video|title=Trippy Ginger Rogers Pig Latin |quote=YouTube}}).

But in different parts of the world, there are different 'dialects' of sorts. Some people may add 'way' or just 'ay' or other endings. Examples are:\n*\"eat\" = \"eatyay\" or \"eatay\"\n*\"omelet\" = \"omeletyay\" or \"omeletay\"\n*\"are\" = \"areyay\" or \"areay\"\n*\"egg\" = \"eggyay\" or \"eggay\"\n*\"explain\" = \"explainyay\"\n*\"always\" = \"alwaysyay\" or \"alwaysay\"\n*\"ends\" = \"endsyay\" or \"endsay\"\n*\"honest\" = \"honestyay\"\n*\"I\"= \"Iyay\"\n\nAn alternative convention for words beginning with vowel sounds, one removes the initial vowel(s) along with the first consonant or consonant cluster.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} This usually only works for words with more than one syllable and offers a variant of the words in keeping with the mysterious, unrecognizable sounds of the converted words. Examples are:\n*\"every\" = \"eryevay\"\n*\"another\" = \"otheranay\"\n*\"under\" = \"erunday\"\n*\"island\" = \"andislay\"\n*\"elegant\" = \"egantelay\"\n\nSentence structure remains the same as it would in [[English language|English]]. [[Pronunciation]] of some words may be a little difficult for beginners, but people can easily understand Pig Latin with practice.<!--emma  = emmway\nPlease do not add new examples here unless they really do follow a similar pattern as Pig Latin (moving a single phoneme cluster from one part of the word to another and adding something extra).

In Cyprus, there was a similar language game that involved the pattern verevereve, varavarava vuruvuruvu, etc; the vowel depends on the vowel that precedes the pattern. \n\nThe [[Swedish language|Swedish]] equivalent of Pig Latin is Fikonspr\u00e5ket (\"Fig language\" \u2013 see [[Language game#List of common language games|Language game \u00a7 List of common language games]]).\n\nThe [[Finnish language|Finnish]] Pig Latin is called Kontinkieli (\"container language\"). After each word you add the word kontti \"container\", then switch the first syllables, So every sentence is converted to twice as many pseudo-words. For example,\"wikipedia\" --> \"wikipedia kontti\" --> \"kokipedia wintti\". So converting the sentence \"I love you\" (\"Min\u00e4 rakastan sinua\") would result in \"kon\u00e4 mintti kokastan rantti konua sintti\".\n\nAnother equivalent of Pig Latin is used throughout the [[Serbo-Croatian]]-speaking parts of the [[Balkans]]. It is called \"\u0160atra\" ({{IPA-sh|\u0283atra}}) or \"[[\u0160atrova\u010dki]]\" ({{IPA-sh|\u0283atrovat\u0361\u0283ki}}) and was used in crime-related and street language. For instance, the slang name for [[marijuana]] (''trava'', meaning \"grass\" \u2014 [[accusative case]] ''travu'') becomes ''vutra''; the slang name for [[cocaine]] (''belo'' \u2014 meaning \"white\") turns to ''lobe'', a [[pistol]] (''pi\u0161tolj'') turns to ''\u0161toljpi'', [[brother|bro]] ([[vocative case]] ''brate'') becomes ''tebra''. In the past few years it has become widely used among teenage immigrants in former [[Yugoslavia]]n countries.\n\nIn [[Italian language|Italian]], the ''[[Farfallino alphabet|alfabeto farfallino]]'' uses a similar encoding.\n\nIn [[Spanish language]], [[Jeringonza]] (or Jeringoso) is a language game used in Spain and all over [[Hispanic America]]. It consists of adding the letter ''p'' after each vowel of a word, and repeating the vowel. For example, ''Carlos'' turns into ''C\u00e1par-lopos''. Variants of this language game add other syllables instead of p+vowel, such as adding ''ti'', ''cuti'' or ''chi'' before each syllable (thus giving ''ticar-tilos'' for the previous example).\n\n[[French language|French]] has the ''[[Louch\u00e9bem|loucherbem]]'' (or ''louch\u00e9bem'', or ''largonji''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/largonji|title=LARGONJI : D\u00e9finition de LARGONJI|date=|publisher=Cnrtl.fr|accessdate=2014-03-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230235148/http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/largonji|archive-date=2013-12-30|url-status=live}}</ref>) coded language, which supposedly was originally used by butchers (''boucher'' in French).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/lfr_0023-8368_1991_num_90_1_6200|title=''Larl\u00e9pem largomuche du louch\u00e9bem.

Example: ''combien'' (how much) = ''lombienqu\u00e8s''. Similar coded languages are ''[[verlan]]'' and ''langue de feu'' (see [[:fr:Javanais (argot)]]. A few louch\u00e9bem words have become usual French words: ''fou'' (crazy) = ''loufoque'', ''portefeuille'' (wallet) = ''larfeuille'', ''en douce'' (on the quiet) = ''en louced\u00e9''. Also similar is the widely used French argot ''[[verlan]]'', in which the syllables of words are transposed. Verlan is a French slang that is quite similar to English pig Latin. It is spoken by separating a word into syllables and reversing the syllables.\n\nVerlan was first documented as being used as far back as the 19th century. Back in the 19th century it was spoken as code by criminals in effort to conceal illicit activities within conversations around other people, even the police. Currently, Verlan has been increasingly used in areas just outside major cities mainly populated by migrant workers. This language has served as a language bridge between many of these migrant workers from multiple countries and origins and has been so widely and readily used that it has spread into advertising, film scripts, French rap and hip-hop music, media, in some French dictionaries and in some cases, words that have been Verlanned have actually replaced their original words. The new uses of Verlan and how it has become incorporated into the French culture has all happened within just a few decades.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://proxy.umpqua.edu/login?url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=STND&sw=w&u=umpqua&v=2.1&it=r&id=GALE%7CA90553064&asid=b0475de0be51d24e83abf3ddb8258678|title=Backward runs French.

It was something like the well-known 'pig Latin' that all sorts of children like to play with.\"\n\nThe modern version of Pig Latin appears in a 1919 [[Columbia Records]] album containing what sounds like the modern variation, by a singer named [[Arthur Fields]]. The song, called [https://archive.org/details/PigLatinLove Pig Latin Love], is followed by the subtitle \"I-Yay Ove-Lay oo-yay earie-day\".<ref>'''I Always Wondered:''' [http://ialwayswondered.jarrettgreen.com/2011/05/25/where-did-pig-latin-come-from/ Where did Pig Latin come from?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129214016/http://ialwayswondered.jarrettgreen.com/2011/05/25/where-did-pig-latin-come-from/ |date=2016-01-29 }}<br/>The consensus seems to be that the version of Pig Latin we know today, was born sometime in the 20th century. In 1919 Columbia records released an album with Arthur Fields singing \u201cPig Latin Love\u201d. The Subtitle \u201cI-Yay Ove-Lay oo-yay earie-day\u201d indicates that this is the modern form of Pig Latin we recognize today. I was able to scrounge up a photograph of the 1919 sheet music on eBay. Below the Pig Latin subtitle is the translation, \u201c(I love you dearie)\u201d, suggesting that perhaps this form of Pig Latin hadn\u2019t taken root among the general public yet.</ref> [[The Three Stooges]] used it on multiple occasions, most notably ''[[Tassels in the Air]]'', a 1938 short where [[Moe Howard]] attempts to teach [[Curley Howard]] how to use it, thereby conveying the rules to the audience. In an earlier (1934) episode, ''[[Three Little Pigskins]]'', [[Larry Fine]] attempts to impress a woman with his skill in Pig Latin, but it turns out that she knows it, too.

But in different parts of the world, there are different 'dialects' of sorts. Some people may add 'way' or just 'ay' or other endings. Examples are:\n*\"eat\" = \"eatyay\" or \"eatay\"\n*\"omelet\" = \"omeletyay\" or \"omeletay\"\n*\"are\" = \"areyay\" or \"areay\"\n*\"egg\" = \"eggyay\" or \"eggay\"\n*\"explain\" = \"explainyay\"\n*\"always\" = \"alwaysyay\" or \"alwaysay\"\n*\"ends\" = \"endsyay\" or \"endsay\"\n*\"honest\" = \"honestyay\"\n*\"I\"= \"Iyay\"\n\nAn alternative convention for words beginning with vowel sounds, one removes the initial vowel(s) along with the first consonant or consonant cluster.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} This usually only works for words with more than one syllable and offers a variant of the words in keeping with the mysterious, unrecognizable sounds of the converted words.

In Cyprus, there was a similar language game that involved the pattern verevereve, varavarava vuruvuruvu, etc; the vowel depends on the vowel that precedes the pattern. \n\nThe [[Swedish language|Swedish]] equivalent of Pig Latin is Fikonspr\u00e5ket (\"Fig language\" \u2013 see [[Language game#List of common language games|Language game \u00a7 List of common language games]]).\n\nThe [[Finnish language|Finnish]] Pig Latin is called Kontinkieli (\"container language\"). After each word you add the word kontti \"container\", then switch the first syllables, So every sentence is converted to twice as many pseudo-words. For example,\"wikipedia\" --> \"wikipedia kontti\" --> \"kokipedia wintti\". So converting the sentence \"I love you\" (\"Min\u00e4 rakastan sinua\") would result in \"kon\u00e4 mintti kokastan rantti konua sintti\".\n\nAnother equivalent of Pig Latin is used throughout the [[Serbo-Croatian]]-speaking parts of the [[Balkans]]. It is called \"\u0160atra\" ({{IPA-sh|\u0283atra}}) or \"[[\u0160atrova\u010dki]]\" ({{IPA-sh|\u0283atrovat\u0361\u0283ki}}) and was used in crime-related and street language. For instance, the slang name for [[marijuana]] (''trava'', meaning \"grass\" \u2014 [[accusative case]] ''travu'') becomes ''vutra''; the slang name for [[cocaine]] (''belo'' \u2014 meaning \"white\") turns to ''lobe'', a [[pistol]] (''pi\u0161tolj'') turns to ''\u0161toljpi'', [[brother|bro]] ([[vocative case]] ''brate'') becomes ''tebra''. In the past few years it has become widely used among teenage immigrants in former [[Yugoslavia]]n countries.\n\nIn [[Italian language|Italian]], the ''[[Farfallino alphabet|alfabeto farfallino]]'' uses a similar encoding.\n\nIn [[Spanish language]], [[Jeringonza]] (or Jeringoso) is a language game used in Spain and all over [[Hispanic America]]. It consists of adding the letter ''p'' after each vowel of a word, and repeating the vowel. For example, ''Carlos'' turns into ''C\u00e1par-lopos''. Variants of this language game add other syllables instead of p+vowel, such as adding ''ti'', ''cuti'' or ''chi'' before each syllable (thus giving ''ticar-tilos'' for the previous example).\n\n[[French language|French]] has the ''[[Louch\u00e9bem|loucherbem]]'' (or ''louch\u00e9bem'', or ''largonji''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/largonji|title=LARGONJI : D\u00e9finition de LARGONJI|date=|publisher=Cnrtl.fr|accessdate=2014-03-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230235148/http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/largonji|archive-date=2013-12-30|url-status=live}}</ref>) coded language, which supposedly was originally used by butchers (''boucher'' in French).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/lfr_0023-8368_1991_num_90_1_6200|title=''Larl\u00e9pem largomuche du louch\u00e9bem.

Example: ''combien'' (how much) = ''lombienqu\u00e8s''. Similar coded languages are ''[[verlan]]'' and ''langue de feu'' (see [[:fr:Javanais (argot)]]. A few louch\u00e9bem words have become usual French words: ''fou'' (crazy) = ''loufoque'', ''portefeuille'' (wallet) = ''larfeuille'', ''en douce'' (on the quiet) = ''en louced\u00e9''. Also similar is the widely used French argot ''[[verlan]]'', in which the syllables of words are transposed. Verlan is a French slang that is quite similar to English pig Latin. It is spoken by separating a word into syllables and reversing the syllables.\n\nVerlan was first documented as being used as far back as the 19th century. Back in the 19th century it was spoken as code by criminals in effort to conceal illicit activities within conversations around other people, even the police. Currently, Verlan has been increasingly used in areas just outside major cities mainly populated by migrant workers. This language has served as a language bridge between many of these migrant workers from multiple countries and origins and has been so widely and readily used that it has spread into advertising, film scripts, French rap and hip-hop music, media, in some French dictionaries and in some cases, words that have been Verlanned have actually replaced their original words. The new uses of Verlan and how it has become incorporated into the French culture has all happened within just a few decades.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://proxy.umpqua.edu/login?url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=STND&sw=w&u=umpqua&v=2.1&it=r&id=GALE%7CA90553064&asid=b0475de0be51d24e83abf3ddb8258678|title=Backward runs French.

The House voted for the motions effectively killing the bill. That and similar procedures were used against him many times.<ref>Ron Gomez, p. 230</ref> </blockquote>Gomez said that he recalls Duke obtaining the passage of only a single bill, legislation which prohibited movie producers or book publishers from compensating jurors for accounts of their court experiences.<ref>Gomez, ''Recovering Legislator'', pgs. 231-2</ref>\n\nGomez added that Duke's \"tenure in the House was short and uninspired.

He eliminated his high-octane anti-Semitic rhetoric. He was particularly concerned with the plight of \"European-Americans.\" He never blatantly spoke of race as a factor but referred to the \"growing underclass.\" He used the tried and true demagoguery of [[class envy]] to sell his message: excessive taxpayers' money spent on welfare, school busing practices, [[affirmative action]]... and set-aside programs.

He was also fined US$10,000 and ordered to cooperate with the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) and to pay money still owed for his 1998 taxes. Following his release in May 2004, he stated that his decision to take the plea bargain was motivated by the bias that he perceived in the [[United States federal courts|United States federal court system]] and not his guilt. He said he felt the charges were contrived to derail his political career and discredit him to his followers, and that he took the safe route by pleading guilty and receiving a mitigated sentence rather than pleading not guilty and potentially receiving the full sentence.\n\nThe mail fraud charges stemmed from what prosecutors described as a six-year scheme to dupe thousands of his followers by asking for donations.

He eliminated his high-octane anti-Semitic rhetoric. He was particularly concerned with the plight of \"European-Americans.\" He never blatantly spoke of race as a factor but referred to the \"growing underclass.\" He used the tried and true demagoguery of [[class envy]] to sell his message: excessive taxpayers' money spent on welfare, school busing practices, [[affirmative action]]... and set-aside programs.

He was also fined US$10,000 and ordered to cooperate with the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) and to pay money still owed for his 1998 taxes. Following his release in May 2004, he stated that his decision to take the plea bargain was motivated by the bias that he perceived in the [[United States federal courts|United States federal court system]] and not his guilt. He said he felt the charges were contrived to derail his political career and discredit him to his followers, and that he took the safe route by pleading guilty and receiving a mitigated sentence rather than pleading not guilty and potentially receiving the full sentence.\n\nThe mail fraud charges stemmed from what prosecutors described as a six-year scheme to dupe thousands of his followers by asking for donations. Using the postal service, Duke appealed to his supporters for funds by fraudulently stating he was about to lose his house and his life savings. Prosecutors alleged that Duke raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in this scheme. Prosecutors also stipulated that in contrast to what he stated in the mailings, he sold his home at a hefty profit, had multiple investment accounts, and spent much of his money gambling at casinos.<ref name=\"foxnews.com\"/><ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/12/18/national/main533483.shtml Ex-Klan Leader David Duke Indicted] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102141505/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/12/18/national/main533483.shtml |date=November 2, 2012 }} CBS News</ref><ref>[http://archives.cnn.com/2002/LAW/12/18/duke.plea/index.html Duke pleads guilty to fraud, false tax claims] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114175833/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/LAW/12/18/duke.plea/index.html |date=November 14, 2007 }} CNN</ref>\n\n[[The Smoking Gun]] posted the entire file of court documents related to this case at its website, including details on Duke's guilty pleas.<ref>[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/david-duke-pleads-federal-charges David Duke Pleads To Federal Charges] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181024230906/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/david-duke-pleads-federal-charges |date=October 24, 2018 }} Bill of Information for Mail Fraud and False Statements on an Income Tax Return</ref>\n\n=== 2009 arrest in the Czech Republic ===\n[[File:David Duke (Belgium 2008).png|thumb|Duke in Belgium in 2008]]\nIn April 2009, Duke traveled to the Czech Republic on invitation by a Czech [[Neo Nazism|neo-Nazi]] group known as ''N\u00e1rodn\u00ed Odpor'' (\"National Resistance\") to deliver three lectures in [[Prague]] and [[Brno]] to promote the Czech translation of his book ''My Awakening''.<ref name=\"Edelwei\u00df f\u00fcr den Grand Wizard\">[http://jungle-world.com/artikel/2009/22/35175.html Edelwei\u00df f\u00fcr den Grand Wizard] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304031434/http://jungle-world.com/artikel/2009/22/35175.html |date=March 4, 2016 }}, [[Jungle World]], Nr. 22, 28.

It was damaged in a volcanic eruption on the island in 1961, which forced the entire population to abandon the settlement and evacuate to [[Calshot]], Hampshire in the UK. The eruption destroyed the settlement's [[Tristan rock lobster|crayfish]] factory.\n\nAfter the return of most of the islanders in 1963, the settlement was rebuilt.

A military garrison was maintained on the islands as a guard against any French attempts to rescue [[Napoleon]], who was imprisoned on [[Saint Helena]]. The military garrison remained until the end of [[World War II]].\n\nIt is named after [[Alfred of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh]], the second son of [[Queen Victoria]], in honour of his visit to the island in 1867.<ref>Courtney, Nicholas (2004). The Queen's Stamps. {{ISBN|0-413-77228-4}}, page 28. The visit took place during the [[circumnavigation]] the Duke of Edinburgh did while commanding HMS ''Galatea''. Tristan da Cunha post office issued four stamps in 1967 to celebrate the centenary of this visit.</ref>\n\nEdinburgh of the Seven Seas is the only major settlement of Tristan da Cunha, and contains a small port, the Administrator's residence, and the post office. It was damaged in a volcanic eruption on the island in 1961, which forced the entire population to abandon the settlement and evacuate to [[Calshot]], Hampshire in the UK. The eruption destroyed the settlement's [[Tristan rock lobster|crayfish]] factory.\n\nAfter the return of most of the islanders in 1963, the settlement was rebuilt. The harbour at Edinburgh was named Calshot Harbour, after their temporary home during the eruption.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tristandc.com/harbour.php|title=Tristan da Cunha's Calshot Harbour|publisher=|accessdate=30 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n===Climate===\nThe archipelago has a wet [[oceanic climate]] under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen system]] with mild temperatures, but consistent moderate to heavy rainfall and very limited sunshine, due to the persistent westerly winds.

The nine appointed members then select the [[United States Postmaster General|United States postmaster general]], who serves as the board's tenth member, and who oversees the day-to-day activities of the service as chief executive officer (see {{usc|39|202|203}}).

While not explicitly defined, the Postal Service's [[universal service obligation]] (USO) is broadly outlined in statute and includes multiple dimensions: geographic scope, range of products, access to services and facilities, delivery frequency, affordable and uniform pricing, service quality, and security of the mail. While other carriers may claim to voluntarily provide delivery on a broad basis, the Postal Service is the only carrier with a ''legal obligation'' to provide all the various aspects of universal service.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://about.usps.com/universal-postal-service/usps-uso-executive-summary.pdf|title=Mission statement|website=about.usps.com|access-date=2017-01-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412172323/https://about.usps.com/universal-postal-service/usps-uso-executive-summary.pdf|archive-date=2019-04-12|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nProponents of universal service principles claim that since any obligation must be matched by the financial capability to meet that obligation, the postal monopoly was put in place as a funding mechanism for the USO, and it has been in place for over a hundred years. It consists of two parts: the [[Private Express Statutes]] (PES) and the mailbox access rule. The PES refers to the Postal Service's monopoly on the delivery of letters, and the mailbox rule refers to the Postal Service's exclusive access to customer mailboxes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://about.usps.com/universal-postal-service/usps-uso-report.pdf|title=Report On Universal Postal Service and The Postal Monopoly|website=|publisher=USPS|access-date=28 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161219020753/http://about.usps.com/universal-postal-service/usps-uso-report.pdf|archive-date=19 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nProponents of universal service principles further claim that eliminating or reducing the PES or mailbox rule would affect the ability of the Postal Service to provide affordable universal service.

The report must include any recommended changes. The Postal Service report supports the requirement that the PRC is to consult with and solicit written comments from the Postal Service. In addition, the Government Accountability Office is required to evaluate broader business model issues by 2011.\n\nOn October 15, 2008, the Postal Service submitted a report<ref>[http://www.usps.com/postallaw/universalpostalservice.htm USPS.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623183803/http://www.usps.com/postallaw/universalpostalservice.htm |date=June 23, 2011 }}. USPS.com (November 26, 2008). Retrieved on July 8, 2011.</ref> to the PRC on its position related to the Universal Service Obligation (USO). It said no changes to the USO and restriction on mailbox access were necessary at this time, but increased regulatory flexibility was required to ensure affordable universal service in the future. In 2013, the Postal Service announced that starting August 2013, Saturday delivery would be discontinued.\n\nObligations of the USO include uniform prices, quality of service, access to services, and six-day delivery to every part of the country. To assure financial support for these obligations, the postal monopoly provides the Postal Service the exclusive right to deliver letters and restricts mailbox access solely for mail. The report argued that eliminating or reducing either aspect of the monopoly \"would have a devastating impact on the ability ... to provide the affordable universal service that the country values so highly\". Relaxing access to the mailbox would also pose security concerns, increase delivery costs, and hurt customer service, according to the Post Office. The report notes:\n\n<blockquote>It is somewhat misleading to characterize the mailbox rule as a \"monopoly,\" because the enforcement of {{UnitedStatesCode|18|1725}} leaves customers with ample alternative means of delivering their messages. Customers can deliver their messages either by paying postage, by placing messages on or under a door or a doormat, by using newspaper or non-postal boxes, by telephoning or emailing, by engaging in person-to-person delivery in public areas, by tacking or taping their notices on a door post, or by placing advertisements in local newspapers. These methods are comparable in efficacy to communication via the mailbox. </blockquote>\n\nMost of these alternatives are not actually free in some communities. For example, in the [[Chicago metropolitan area]] and many other [[Metropolis|major metros]] one must get a background check from [[police]] and pay a daily fee for the right to solicit or post [[Advertising|commercial]] messages on [[private property]].\n\nRegarding the monopoly on delivery of letters, the report notes that the monopoly is not complete, as there is an exception for letters where either ''the amount paid for private carriage of the letter equals at least six times the current rate for the first ounce of a single-piece First-Class Mail letter (also known as the \"base rate\" or \"base tariff\")'' or ''the letter weighs at least 12.5 ounces.''\n\nThe Postal Service said that the USO should continue to be broadly defined and there should be no changes to the postal monopoly. Any changes would have far-reaching effects on customers and the trillion dollar mailing industry. \"A more rigidly defined USO would  ... ultimately harm the American public and businesses,\" according to the report, which cautions that any potential change must be studied carefully and the effects fully understood.\n\n===Competitors===\n[[File:U.S. Post Office - Los Angeles Terminal Annex.jpg|thumb|USPS [[Terminal Annex]] building in Los Angeles]]\n\n[[FedEx]] and [[United Parcel Service]] (UPS) directly compete with USPS Express Mail and package delivery services, making nationwide deliveries of urgent letters and packages.

However, both companies have transit agreements with the USPS in which an item can be dropped off with either FedEx or UPS who will then provide shipment up to the destination post office serving the intended recipient where it will be transferred for delivery to the U.S. Mail destination, including Post Office Box destinations.<ref name=\"smartpost\">{{cite web | url=http://www.fedex.com/us/smart-post/outbound.html | title=FedEx SmartPost\u00ae Shipping & Tracking for Low Weight Packages | publisher=FedEx | accessdate=April 11, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405161604/http://www.fedex.com/us/smart-post/outbound.html | archive-date=April 5, 2012 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"mailinno\">{{cite web | url=http://www.upsmailinnovations.com/services/index.html | title=UPS Mail Innovations \u2013 Overview | publisher=United Parcel Service | accessdate=April 11, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505114221/http://upsmailinnovations.com/services/index.html | archive-date=May 5, 2012 | url-status=live }}</ref> These services also deliver packages which are larger and heavier than USPS will accept.

Postage meters are regulated by a country's postal authority; for example, in the United States, the United States Postal Service specifies the rules for the creation, support, and use of postage meters. A postage meter imprints an amount of postage, functioning as a postage stamp, a cancellation and a dated postmark all in one. The meter stamp serves as proof of payment and eliminates the need for adhesive stamps.\n\n====PC Postage====\n\nIn addition to using standard stamps, postage can now be printed in the form of an electronic stamp, or e-stamp, from a personal computer using a system called [[Information Based Indicia]].

As mail travels through the DPRCS, large items, such as packages and mail bundles, are removed from the stream. As the remaining mail enters the first machine for processing standard mail, the [[Advanced Facer-Canceler System]] (AFCS), pieces that passed through the DPRCS but do not conform to physical dimensions for processing in the AFCS (e.g., large envelopes or overstuffed standard envelopes) are automatically diverted from the stream. Mail removed from the DPRCS and AFCS is manually processed or sent to parcel sorting machines.\n\nIn contrast to the previous system, which merely canceled and postmarked the upper right corner of the envelope, thereby missing any stamps which were inappropriately placed, the Advanced Facer-Canceler System locates [[Indicia (philately)|indicia]] (stamp or metered [[postage]] mark), regardless of the orientation of the mail as it enters the machine, and cancels it by applying a [[postmark]]. Detection of indicia enables the AFCS to determine the orientation of each mailpiece and sort it accordingly, rotating pieces as necessary so all mail is sorted right-side up and faced in the same direction in each output bin.\n\nMail is output by the machine into three categories: mail already affixed with a [[bar code]] and addressed (such as business reply envelopes and cards); mail with machine printed (typed) addresses; and mail with handwritten addresses. Additionally, machines with a recent [[Optical Character Recognition]] (OCR) upgrade have the capability to read the address information, including handwritten, and sort the mail based on local or outgoing ZIP codes.\n\nMail with typed addresses goes to a [[Multiline Optical Character Reader]] (MLOCR) which reads the ZIP Code and address information and prints the appropriate bar code onto the envelope. Mail (actually the scanned image of the mail) with handwritten addresses (and machine-printed ones that are not easily recognized) goes to the [[Remote Bar Coding System]]. It also corrects spelling errors and, where there is an error, omission, or conflict in the written address, identifies the most likely correct address.\n\nWhen it has decided on a correct address, it prints the appropriate bar code onto the envelopes, similarly to the MLOCR system. RBCS also has facilities in place, called [[Remote Encoding Center]]s, that have humans look at images of mail pieces and enter the address data. The address data is associated with the image via an ID Tag, a [[fluorescent]] [[barcode]] printed by mail processing equipment on the back of mail pieces.\n\nProcessed mail is imaged by the [[Mail Isolation Control and Tracking]] (MICT) system to allow easier tracking of hazardous substances. Images are taken at more than 200 mail processing centers, and are destroyed after being retained for 30 days.<ref name=\"WaPo_confirm\">{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Miga |url=https://news.yahoo.com/ap-interview-postal-takes-photos-mail-keeps-images-074323981.html |publisher=Yahoo!

If this address is found, the machine will paste a label over the former address with the current address. The mail is returned to the mailstream to forward to the new location.\n\nMail with addresses that cannot be resolved by the automated system are separated for human intervention. If a local postal worker can read the address, he or she manually sorts it out according to the ZIP code on the article. If the address cannot be read, mail is either returned to the sender (First-Class Mail with a valid return address) or is sent to the Mail Recovery Center in Atlanta, Georgia (formerly known as the [[dead letter office]]). At this office, the mail is opened to try to find an address to forward to. If an address is found, the contents are resealed and delivered. Otherwise, the items are held for 90 days in case of inquiry by the customer; if they are not claimed, they are either destroyed or auctioned off at the monthly Postal Service Unclaimed Parcel auction to raise money for the service.\n\nOnce the mail is bar coded, it is automatically sorted by a [[delivery bar code sorter|Delivery Bar Code Sorter]] (DBCS) that reads the bar code, identifies the destination of the mailpiece, and sends it to an appropriate tray that corresponds to the next segment of its journey.\n\nRegional mail is either trucked to the appropriate local post office, or kept in the building for carrier routes served directly from the P&DC. Out-of-region mail is trucked to the airport and then flown, usually as baggage on commercial airlines, to the airport nearest the destination station. At the destination P&DC, mail is once again read by a DBCS which sorts items to local post offices; this includes grouping mailpieces by individual mail carrier.\n\nAt the carrier route level, 95% of letters arrive pre-sorted;<ref name=\"bard\" /> the remaining mail must be sorted by hand.

Mail routes are outfitted with a number of scanpoints (mailbox barcodes) on random streets every 30 to 40 minutes apart to keep track of the Carriers' whereabouts up until the last 5 minutes of any given workday.\n* '''Rural carriers''' are under a form of salary called \"evaluated hours\", usually with overtime built into their pay. The evaluated hours are created by having all mail counted for a period of two or four weeks, and a formula used to create the set dollar amount they will be paid for each day worked until the next time the route is counted.\n* '''Mail handlers and processors''', prepare, separate, load and unload mail and parcels, by delivery ZIP code and station, for the clerks. They work almost exclusively at the plants or larger mail facilities now after having their duties excessed and reassigned to clerks in Post Offices and Station branches.\n* '''Clerks''', have a dual function by design of where their assignment is. Window clerks directly handle customer service needs at the counter, sort box mail and also sort first-class letters, standard and bulk-rate mail for the carriers on the work floor. Clerks may also work alongside mail handlers in large sorting facilities, outside of the public view, sorting mail. Data Conversion Operators, who encode address information at Remote Encoding Centers, are also members of the clerk craft. Mail handlers and Clerks are represented by the NPMHU and the APWU, respectively.\n\nOther non-managerial positions in the USPS include:\n* '''Maintenance and custodians''', who see to the overall operation and cleaning of mail sorting machines, work areas, public parking and general facility operations.\n* '''City Carrier Assistants'''. (CCAs) With the Das Arbitration award the designation of PTF City Carrier has been abolished. TE City Carriers will have the opportunity to become CCAs. A CCA is a non-career employee who is hired for a 360-day term, similar to what TEs had. CCAs earn annual leave. CCAs, unlike TEs do have a direct path to becoming career employees. When excess City Carrier positions exist the CCA in that work installation with the highest \"relative standing\" will be promoted to a career employee and be assigned to the vacant position.\n* '''Career, Part Time Flexible and Transitional employees''' (Career, PTF & TE) There are a variety of other non-managerial positions in such crafts as accounting, information technology, and the remote encoding center. These are under a different contract than plant workers or mail carriers.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.apwu.org/issues/itasc-os-employees | publisher=APWU | title=IT/ASC & OS Employees | accessdate=2016-04-25 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160212072133/https://www.apwu.org/issues/itasc-os-employees | archive-date=2016-02-12 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n*'''Contractors''' are not USPS employees, but work for the USPS under a written contract and usually paid per mile. They do not get benefits including health insurance, leave, life insurance, and pension. They must use their own vehicle and pay any cost to maintain, insure, or replace. Contractors generally make less than employees. Just like regular carriers they deliver packages and letters to mailboxes and doors.\n\nThough the USPS employs many individuals, as more Americans send information via email, fewer postal workers are needed to work dwindling amounts of mail. Post offices and mail facilities are constantly downsizing, replacing craft positions with new machines and consolidating mail routes through the MIARAP (Modified Interim Alternate Route Adjustment Process) agreement. A major round of job cuts, early retirements, and a construction freeze were announced on March 20, 2009.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/03/20/post.office.cuts/index.html | publisher=CNN | title=Postal service to slash more than 3,000 jobs, offer early retirements | date=March 20, 2009 | accessdate=May 26, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410184821/http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/03/20/post.office.cuts/index.html | archive-date=April 10, 2010 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Workplace violence===\n{{see also|Edmond post office shooting|List of postal killings#United States}}\n\nIn the early 1990s, widely publicized [[Workplace violence|workplace shootings]] by disgruntled employees at USPS facilities led to a Human Resource effort to provide care for stressed workers and resources for coworker conflicts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://about.usps.com/postal-bulletin/2012/pb22341/html/info_003.htm#ep1440011 |title=Human Resources |publisher=About.usps.com |accessdate=2013-03-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627021829/http://about.usps.com/postal-bulletin/2012/pb22341/html/info_003.htm#ep1440011 |archive-date=2013-06-27 |url-status=live }}</ref> Due to media coverage, postal employees gained a reputation among the general public as more likely to be [[Mental disorder|mentally ill]].

The contention was that it would have been illegal for the United States Post Office to deliver mail that was addressed to \"Santa Claus\" to the character \"Kris Kringle\" unless he were, in fact, the one and only Santa Claus.

Of the eleven members of the Board, nine are appointed by the President and confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] (see {{usc|39|202}}). The nine appointed members then select the [[United States Postmaster General|United States postmaster general]], who serves as the board's tenth member, and who oversees the day-to-day activities of the service as chief executive officer (see {{usc|39|202|203}}). The ten-member board then nominates a deputy postmaster general, who acts as chief operating officer, to the eleventh and last remaining open seat.\n\nThe independent [[Postal Regulatory Commission]] (formerly the Postal Rate Commission) is also controlled by appointees of the President confirmed by the Senate. It oversees postal rates and related concerns, having the authority to approve or reject USPS proposals.\n\nThe USPS is often mistaken for a [[government-owned corporation]] (e.g., [[Amtrak]]) because it operates much like a business.

As a [[government agency]], it has many special privileges, including [[sovereign immunity]], [[eminent domain]] powers, powers to negotiate [[Universal Postal Union|postal treaties]] with foreign nations, and an exclusive legal right to deliver first-class and third-class mail.

While other carriers may claim to voluntarily provide delivery on a broad basis, the Postal Service is the only carrier with a ''legal obligation'' to provide all the various aspects of universal service.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://about.usps.com/universal-postal-service/usps-uso-executive-summary.pdf|title=Mission statement|website=about.usps.com|access-date=2017-01-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412172323/https://about.usps.com/universal-postal-service/usps-uso-executive-summary.pdf|archive-date=2019-04-12|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nProponents of universal service principles claim that since any obligation must be matched by the financial capability to meet that obligation, the postal monopoly was put in place as a funding mechanism for the USO, and it has been in place for over a hundred years. It consists of two parts: the [[Private Express Statutes]] (PES) and the mailbox access rule. The PES refers to the Postal Service's monopoly on the delivery of letters, and the mailbox rule refers to the Postal Service's exclusive access to customer mailboxes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://about.usps.com/universal-postal-service/usps-uso-report.pdf|title=Report On Universal Postal Service and The Postal Monopoly|website=|publisher=USPS|access-date=28 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161219020753/http://about.usps.com/universal-postal-service/usps-uso-report.pdf|archive-date=19 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nProponents of universal service principles further claim that eliminating or reducing the PES or mailbox rule would affect the ability of the Postal Service to provide affordable universal service.

The report must include any recommended changes. The Postal Service report supports the requirement that the PRC is to consult with and solicit written comments from the Postal Service. In addition, the Government Accountability Office is required to evaluate broader business model issues by 2011.\n\nOn October 15, 2008, the Postal Service submitted a report<ref>[http://www.usps.com/postallaw/universalpostalservice.htm USPS.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623183803/http://www.usps.com/postallaw/universalpostalservice.htm |date=June 23, 2011 }}. USPS.com (November 26, 2008). Retrieved on July 8, 2011.</ref> to the PRC on its position related to the Universal Service Obligation (USO). It said no changes to the USO and restriction on mailbox access were necessary at this time, but increased regulatory flexibility was required to ensure affordable universal service in the future. In 2013, the Postal Service announced that starting August 2013, Saturday delivery would be discontinued.\n\nObligations of the USO include uniform prices, quality of service, access to services, and six-day delivery to every part of the country. To assure financial support for these obligations, the postal monopoly provides the Postal Service the exclusive right to deliver letters and restricts mailbox access solely for mail. The report argued that eliminating or reducing either aspect of the monopoly \"would have a devastating impact on the ability ... to provide the affordable universal service that the country values so highly\". Relaxing access to the mailbox would also pose security concerns, increase delivery costs, and hurt customer service, according to the Post Office. The report notes:\n\n<blockquote>It is somewhat misleading to characterize the mailbox rule as a \"monopoly,\" because the enforcement of {{UnitedStatesCode|18|1725}} leaves customers with ample alternative means of delivering their messages. Customers can deliver their messages either by paying postage, by placing messages on or under a door or a doormat, by using newspaper or non-postal boxes, by telephoning or emailing, by engaging in person-to-person delivery in public areas, by tacking or taping their notices on a door post, or by placing advertisements in local newspapers. These methods are comparable in efficacy to communication via the mailbox. </blockquote>\n\nMost of these alternatives are not actually free in some communities. For example, in the [[Chicago metropolitan area]] and many other [[Metropolis|major metros]] one must get a background check from [[police]] and pay a daily fee for the right to solicit or post [[Advertising|commercial]] messages on [[private property]].\n\nRegarding the monopoly on delivery of letters, the report notes that the monopoly is not complete, as there is an exception for letters where either ''the amount paid for private carriage of the letter equals at least six times the current rate for the first ounce of a single-piece First-Class Mail letter (also known as the \"base rate\" or \"base tariff\")'' or ''the letter weighs at least 12.5 ounces.''\n\nThe Postal Service said that the USO should continue to be broadly defined and there should be no changes to the postal monopoly. Any changes would have far-reaching effects on customers and the trillion dollar mailing industry. \"A more rigidly defined USO would  ... ultimately harm the American public and businesses,\" according to the report, which cautions that any potential change must be studied carefully and the effects fully understood.\n\n===Competitors===\n[[File:U.S. Post Office - Los Angeles Terminal Annex.jpg|thumb|USPS [[Terminal Annex]] building in Los Angeles]]\n\n[[FedEx]] and [[United Parcel Service]] (UPS) directly compete with USPS Express Mail and package delivery services, making nationwide deliveries of urgent letters and packages.

However, both companies have transit agreements with the USPS in which an item can be dropped off with either FedEx or UPS who will then provide shipment up to the destination post office serving the intended recipient where it will be transferred for delivery to the U.S. Mail destination, including Post Office Box destinations.<ref name=\"smartpost\">{{cite web | url=http://www.fedex.com/us/smart-post/outbound.html | title=FedEx SmartPost\u00ae Shipping & Tracking for Low Weight Packages | publisher=FedEx | accessdate=April 11, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405161604/http://www.fedex.com/us/smart-post/outbound.html | archive-date=April 5, 2012 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"mailinno\">{{cite web | url=http://www.upsmailinnovations.com/services/index.html | title=UPS Mail Innovations \u2013 Overview | publisher=United Parcel Service | accessdate=April 11, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505114221/http://upsmailinnovations.com/services/index.html | archive-date=May 5, 2012 | url-status=live }}</ref> These services also deliver packages which are larger and heavier than USPS will accept.

As mail travels through the DPRCS, large items, such as packages and mail bundles, are removed from the stream. As the remaining mail enters the first machine for processing standard mail, the [[Advanced Facer-Canceler System]] (AFCS), pieces that passed through the DPRCS but do not conform to physical dimensions for processing in the AFCS (e.g., large envelopes or overstuffed standard envelopes) are automatically diverted from the stream. Mail removed from the DPRCS and AFCS is manually processed or sent to parcel sorting machines.\n\nIn contrast to the previous system, which merely canceled and postmarked the upper right corner of the envelope, thereby missing any stamps which were inappropriately placed, the Advanced Facer-Canceler System locates [[Indicia (philately)|indicia]] (stamp or metered [[postage]] mark), regardless of the orientation of the mail as it enters the machine, and cancels it by applying a [[postmark]]. Detection of indicia enables the AFCS to determine the orientation of each mailpiece and sort it accordingly, rotating pieces as necessary so all mail is sorted right-side up and faced in the same direction in each output bin.\n\nMail is output by the machine into three categories: mail already affixed with a [[bar code]] and addressed (such as business reply envelopes and cards); mail with machine printed (typed) addresses; and mail with handwritten addresses. Additionally, machines with a recent [[Optical Character Recognition]] (OCR) upgrade have the capability to read the address information, including handwritten, and sort the mail based on local or outgoing ZIP codes.\n\nMail with typed addresses goes to a [[Multiline Optical Character Reader]] (MLOCR) which reads the ZIP Code and address information and prints the appropriate bar code onto the envelope. Mail (actually the scanned image of the mail) with handwritten addresses (and machine-printed ones that are not easily recognized) goes to the [[Remote Bar Coding System]]. It also corrects spelling errors and, where there is an error, omission, or conflict in the written address, identifies the most likely correct address.\n\nWhen it has decided on a correct address, it prints the appropriate bar code onto the envelopes, similarly to the MLOCR system. RBCS also has facilities in place, called [[Remote Encoding Center]]s, that have humans look at images of mail pieces and enter the address data. The address data is associated with the image via an ID Tag, a [[fluorescent]] [[barcode]] printed by mail processing equipment on the back of mail pieces.\n\nProcessed mail is imaged by the [[Mail Isolation Control and Tracking]] (MICT) system to allow easier tracking of hazardous substances. Images are taken at more than 200 mail processing centers, and are destroyed after being retained for 30 days.<ref name=\"WaPo_confirm\">{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Miga |url=https://news.yahoo.com/ap-interview-postal-takes-photos-mail-keeps-images-074323981.html |publisher=Yahoo!

If this address is found, the machine will paste a label over the former address with the current address. The mail is returned to the mailstream to forward to the new location.\n\nMail with addresses that cannot be resolved by the automated system are separated for human intervention. If a local postal worker can read the address, he or she manually sorts it out according to the ZIP code on the article. If the address cannot be read, mail is either returned to the sender (First-Class Mail with a valid return address) or is sent to the Mail Recovery Center in Atlanta, Georgia (formerly known as the [[dead letter office]]). At this office, the mail is opened to try to find an address to forward to. If an address is found, the contents are resealed and delivered. Otherwise, the items are held for 90 days in case of inquiry by the customer; if they are not claimed, they are either destroyed or auctioned off at the monthly Postal Service Unclaimed Parcel auction to raise money for the service.\n\nOnce the mail is bar coded, it is automatically sorted by a [[delivery bar code sorter|Delivery Bar Code Sorter]] (DBCS) that reads the bar code, identifies the destination of the mailpiece, and sends it to an appropriate tray that corresponds to the next segment of its journey.\n\nRegional mail is either trucked to the appropriate local post office, or kept in the building for carrier routes served directly from the P&DC. Out-of-region mail is trucked to the airport and then flown, usually as baggage on commercial airlines, to the airport nearest the destination station. At the destination P&DC, mail is once again read by a DBCS which sorts items to local post offices; this includes grouping mailpieces by individual mail carrier.\n\nAt the carrier route level, 95% of letters arrive pre-sorted;<ref name=\"bard\" /> the remaining mail must be sorted by hand.

They are divided into two categories: '''City Letter Carriers''', who are represented by the NALC, and '''[[Rural Letter Carrier]]s''', who are represented by the NRLCA. City Carriers are paid hourly with automatic overtime paid after 8 hours or 40 hours a week of duty. City Carriers are required to work in any kind of weather, daylight or dark and carry three bundles of mail (letters in one hand, magazines in the other and advertisements in a mailbag) in addition to parcels up to a total of 70&nbsp;lbs. Mail routes are outfitted with a number of scanpoints (mailbox barcodes) on random streets every 30 to 40 minutes apart to keep track of the Carriers' whereabouts up until the last 5 minutes of any given workday.\n* '''Rural carriers''' are under a form of salary called \"evaluated hours\", usually with overtime built into their pay. The evaluated hours are created by having all mail counted for a period of two or four weeks, and a formula used to create the set dollar amount they will be paid for each day worked until the next time the route is counted.\n* '''Mail handlers and processors''', prepare, separate, load and unload mail and parcels, by delivery ZIP code and station, for the clerks. They work almost exclusively at the plants or larger mail facilities now after having their duties excessed and reassigned to clerks in Post Offices and Station branches.\n* '''Clerks''', have a dual function by design of where their assignment is. Window clerks directly handle customer service needs at the counter, sort box mail and also sort first-class letters, standard and bulk-rate mail for the carriers on the work floor. Clerks may also work alongside mail handlers in large sorting facilities, outside of the public view, sorting mail. Data Conversion Operators, who encode address information at Remote Encoding Centers, are also members of the clerk craft. Mail handlers and Clerks are represented by the NPMHU and the APWU, respectively.\n\nOther non-managerial positions in the USPS include:\n* '''Maintenance and custodians''', who see to the overall operation and cleaning of mail sorting machines, work areas, public parking and general facility operations.\n* '''City Carrier Assistants'''. (CCAs) With the Das Arbitration award the designation of PTF City Carrier has been abolished. TE City Carriers will have the opportunity to become CCAs. A CCA is a non-career employee who is hired for a 360-day term, similar to what TEs had. CCAs earn annual leave. CCAs, unlike TEs do have a direct path to becoming career employees. When excess City Carrier positions exist the CCA in that work installation with the highest \"relative standing\" will be promoted to a career employee and be assigned to the vacant position.\n* '''Career, Part Time Flexible and Transitional employees''' (Career, PTF & TE) There are a variety of other non-managerial positions in such crafts as accounting, information technology, and the remote encoding center. These are under a different contract than plant workers or mail carriers.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.apwu.org/issues/itasc-os-employees | publisher=APWU | title=IT/ASC & OS Employees | accessdate=2016-04-25 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160212072133/https://www.apwu.org/issues/itasc-os-employees | archive-date=2016-02-12 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n*'''Contractors''' are not USPS employees, but work for the USPS under a written contract and usually paid per mile. They do not get benefits including health insurance, leave, life insurance, and pension. They must use their own vehicle and pay any cost to maintain, insure, or replace. Contractors generally make less than employees. Just like regular carriers they deliver packages and letters to mailboxes and doors.\n\nThough the USPS employs many individuals, as more Americans send information via email, fewer postal workers are needed to work dwindling amounts of mail. Post offices and mail facilities are constantly downsizing, replacing craft positions with new machines and consolidating mail routes through the MIARAP (Modified Interim Alternate Route Adjustment Process) agreement.

The contention was that it would have been illegal for the United States Post Office to deliver mail that was addressed to \"Santa Claus\" to the character \"Kris Kringle\" unless he were, in fact, the one and only Santa Claus. Judge Henry X. Harper (played by [[Gene Lockhart]]) ruled that since the U.S. Government had demonstrated through the delivery of the bags of mail that Kris Kringle was Santa Claus, the [[State of New York]] did not have the authority to overrule that decision.\n* The novel ''[[Post Office (novel)|Post Office]]'' (1971), written by poet and novelist [[Charles Bukowski]], is a semi-autobiographical account of his life over the years as a mail carrier. Bukowski would, under duress, quit and years later return as a mail clerk. His personal account would detail the work at lengths as frustrating, menial, boring, and degrading.\n* [[David Brin]]'s novel ''[[The Postman]]'' (1985) portrays the USPS and its returned services as a staple to revive the United States government in a post-apocalyptic world. It was [[The Postman (film)|adapted as a film]] starring [[Kevin Costner]] and [[Larenz Tate]] in 1997.\n* The comedy film ''[[Dear God (film)|Dear God]]'' (1996), starring [[Greg Kinnear]] and [[Laurie Metcalf]], portrays a group of quirky postal workers in a [[dead letter office]] that handle letters addressed to the [[Easter Bunny]], [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]], and even God himself.\n* In 2015, ''[[The Inspectors (TV series)|The Inspectors]]'', which depicts a group of postal inspectors investigating postal crimes, debuted on [[CBS]].
