Many of these crimes were committed with the assistance of her son, Kenneth \"Kenny\" Kimes Jr. They were tried and convicted together for the murder of Irene Silverman, along with 117 other charges. \n\nKenny made a [[plea deal]] in the murder of David Kazdin, pleading guilty and agreeing to testify against his mother in her trial for Kazdin\u2019s murder  in return for her not facing a [[Capital punishment in the United States|death sentence]]. Sante Kimes was subsequently convicted of that murder. The pair were also suspected but never charged in a third murder in the [[Bahamas]], to which Kenny has confessed.\n\n==Early life==\nAccording to court records, Sante Kimes was born Sandra Louise Singhrs in [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]] to Mary Van Horn, who was of partial [[Dutch people|Dutch]] descent, and Mahendra Prama Singh, who was [[East Indies|East Indian]]. Kimes gave numerous conflicting stories about her origins and numerous other accounts are difficult to confirm, which is why her [[family estrangement|estranged]] son,<ref name=mcfadden/> Kent Walker, says her birth certificate might be forged.<ref>{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Kent|first2=Mark|last2=Schone|title=Son of a Grifter|year=2001|publisher=Harper Collins|location=New York|isbn=978-0060188658|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sonofgriftertwis00walk/page/15 15\u201319]|oclc=46343316|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/sonofgriftertwis00walk/page/15}}</ref> Walker, in his book ''Son of a Grifter'', has reported a claim by an old acquaintance of his mother that Kimes was the daughter of a respectable family who was unable to cope with her aberrant, wild antics.

The search for Ms. Silverman went as far as [[Mount Olive Township, New Jersey|Mount Olive]], [[New Jersey]]. \nDespite the fact that Silverman's body was never found, both mother and son were convicted of murder in 2000, in no small part because of the discovery of Kimes' notebooks detailing the crime and notes written by Silverman, who was extremely suspicious of the pair. Among other things the two suspects kept casually asking Silverman for her ID and [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] number, looked away from security cameras in the building lobby as they walked past, and repeatedly refused to let housekeepers into their rented room for cleaning.\n\nDuring the trial for the Kazdin murder, Kenny confessed that after his mother had used a [[Electroshock weapon|stun gun]] on Silverman, he strangled her, stuffed her corpse into a bag and deposited it in a dumpster in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/24/nyregion/murderer-reveals-new-details-in-slaying-of-socialite-in-1998.html?ref=santekimes |title=Murderer Reveals New Details In Slaying of Socialite in 1998 ''Thomas J.

The FBI and [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] detectives assigned to the investigation focused on the [[mortgage]] loan application with the forged signature that falsely linked Kazdin to a house in Las Vegas which had been partly burned down in an attempted arson. The supposed homeowner turned out to be David McCarran, a homeless man who said Kimes and Kenny had lit the arson fire. He also claimed to have been forced to stay in the house by the Kimeses, who hoped to collect the insurance money from the loss of the house. \n\nInvestigators also located James Patterson, a second man who confessed to selling a handgun to Kenny which he used to kill Kazdin. He was told of several potential felony charges stemming from the murder and [[mortgage fraud]] and reluctantly agreed to cooperate with the police in apprehending the pair to avoid prosecution. \n\nAt the end of June 1998, Patterson got a call from Kimes about an expensive townhouse in [[New York City|New York]]'s [[Upper West Side]] she wanted to sell for $7.7 million (the building owned by Silverman), and she need his help with the paperwork. Patterson agreed to meet her in New York on July 5; he informed the FBI about the scheduled meeting before he left on July 3. Two days later, Patterson met Kimes at the [[New York Hilton]] around 6 p.m. that evening. Around 7 p.m., Kenny arrived at the Hilton and approached Kimes; upon his appearance FBI and [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] officers quickly moved in to arrest both of them. \n\nThe Kimeses had stolen a black [[Lincoln Town Car]] from a rental car dealership in [[Utah]] the previous May using a bounced check. When the police found the vehicle in the following day on July 6, they searched it and found what one officer called a \"treasure chest\" full of evidence: a [[Electroshock weapon|stun gun]] case, forged Social Security cards, two hand guns, a pair of handcuffs, a folder full of various forms and applications related to Silverman's mansion, and a set of fifteen notebooks on which Sante had written detailed descriptions of mortgage fraud schemes involving many intended victims including both Silverman and Kazdin.\n\n== Trials ==\nAlthough the Kazdin murder occurred first, the Kimeses were tried in New York City first for the Silverman murder. Evidence recovered from their car helped establish the case for trying them for Kazdin's murder as well.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/69935467.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Mar+22%2C+2001&author=TWILA+DECKER&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&edition=&startpage=B.1&desc=Con+Artist+Is+Returned+to+L.A.+for+Murder+Trial%3B+Crime%3A+He+and+his+mother+are+accused+of+killing+a+local+businessman.+They+were+convicted+last+year+of+slaying+a+wealthy+New+York+woman |title=Con Artist Is Returned to L.A. for Murder Trial; Crime: He and his mother are accused of killing a local businessman.

Nonetheless, the jury was unanimous in voting to convict them not only of murder but of 117 other charges including robbery, [[burglary]], [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]], [[grand larceny]], illegal weapons possession, forgery and [[eavesdropping]] on their first poll on the subject.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/19/nyregion/mother-and-son-guilty-of-killing-a-socialite-who-vanished-in-98.html?ref=santekimes |title=Mother and Son Guilty of Killing A Socialite Who Vanished in '98 ''David Rhode, The New York Times, 5/19/2000'' |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2000-05-19 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}</ref> \n\nThe judge also took the unusual step of ordering Kimes not to speak to the media even after the jury had been [[Jury sequestration|sequestered]], as a result of her passing a note to ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter [[David Rhode]] in court. The judge threatened to have Kimes handcuffed during further court appearances if she persisted and restricted her telephone access to calls to her lawyers. The judge contended that Kimes was attempting to influence the jury as they may have seen or heard any such interviews, and that there would be no [[cross-examination]] as there would be in court. Kimes had earlier chosen to not take the stand in her own defense after the judge ruled that prosecutors could question her about the previous conviction on slavery charges.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/17/nyregion/sante-kimes-chastised-by-judge-over-contacts-with-news-media.html?ref=santekimes |title=Sante Kimes Chastised by Judge Over Contacts With News Media ''David Rhode, The New York Times, 5/17/2000'' |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2000-05-17 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}</ref>\n\nDuring the sentencing portion of the Silverman trial, Kimes made a prolonged statement to the court blaming the authorities, including their own lawyers, for framing them. She went on to compare their trial to the [[Salem Witch Trials]] and claimed that the prosecutors were guilty of \"murdering the Constitution\" before the judge told her to be quiet. When the statement was concluded, the presiding judge responded that Kimes was a [[Psychopathy|sociopath]] and a degenerate and her son was a dupe and a \"remorseless predator\" before imposing the maximum sentence on both of them.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/28/nyregion/mother-and-son-are-given-life-sentences.html?ref=santekimes |title=Mother and Son Are Given Life Sentences ''Katherine E. Finkelstein, The New York Times, 6/28/2000'' |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2000-06-28 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}</ref> This amounted to 120 years for Sante and 124 years for her son Kenny, effectively sentencing both of them to life in prison. \n\nIn October 2000, while doing an interview, Kenny held [[Court TV]] reporter Maria Zone hostage by pressing a ballpoint pen into her throat. Zone had interviewed Kimes once before without incident.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/11/nyregion/kenneth-kimes-takes-reporter-as-a-hostage.html |title=Kenneth Kimes Takes Reporter As a Hostage ''Shaila K. Dewan, The New York Times, 10/11/200'' |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2000-10-11 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}</ref> Kenny's demand was that his mother not be extradited to [[California]], where the two faced the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] for the murder of Kazdin. After four hours of negotiation, Kenny removed the pen from Zone's throat. Negotiators created a distraction which allowed them to quickly remove Zone and wrestle Kimes to the ground.\n\nIn March 2001, Kenny was extradited to Los Angeles to stand trial for the murder of Kazdin. Kimes was extradited to Los Angeles in June 2001. During that trial in June 2004, while he was facing the death penalty, Kenny changed his plea from \"not guilty\" to \"guilty\" and implicated his mother in the murder in exchange for a [[plea deal]] that his mother should not receive the death penalty if convicted. Kenny then testified in trial against his mother, exposing every detail about their multiple crimes and describing how she indoctrinated him into becoming her accomplice. Kimes again made a prolonged statement denying the murders and accusing police and prosecutors of various kinds of misconduct, and she was again eventually ordered by the presiding judge to be silent.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/653859091.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Jun+22%2C+2004&author=Anna+Gorman&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&edition=&startpage=B.4&desc=Sante+Kimes+Denies+1998+Slaying%3B+She+says+the+Granada+Hills+victim+was+her+%27best+friend%27+and+that+she+didn%27t+order+his+death |title=Sante Kimes Denies 1998 Slaying; She says the Granada Hills victim was her 'best friend' and that she didn't order his death.

Many of these crimes were committed with the assistance of her son, Kenneth \"Kenny\" Kimes Jr. They were tried and convicted together for the murder of Irene Silverman, along with 117 other charges. \n\nKenny made a [[plea deal]] in the murder of David Kazdin, pleading guilty and agreeing to testify against his mother in her trial for Kazdin\u2019s murder  in return for her not facing a [[Capital punishment in the United States|death sentence]]. Sante Kimes was subsequently convicted of that murder. The pair were also suspected but never charged in a third murder in the [[Bahamas]], to which Kenny has confessed.\n\n==Early life==\nAccording to court records, Sante Kimes was born Sandra Louise Singhrs in [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]] to Mary Van Horn, who was of partial [[Dutch people|Dutch]] descent, and Mahendra Prama Singh, who was [[East Indies|East Indian]].

The search for Ms. Silverman went as far as [[Mount Olive Township, New Jersey|Mount Olive]], [[New Jersey]]. \nDespite the fact that Silverman's body was never found, both mother and son were convicted of murder in 2000, in no small part because of the discovery of Kimes' notebooks detailing the crime and notes written by Silverman, who was extremely suspicious of the pair. Among other things the two suspects kept casually asking Silverman for her ID and [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] number, looked away from security cameras in the building lobby as they walked past, and repeatedly refused to let housekeepers into their rented room for cleaning.\n\nDuring the trial for the Kazdin murder, Kenny confessed that after his mother had used a [[Electroshock weapon|stun gun]] on Silverman, he strangled her, stuffed her corpse into a bag and deposited it in a dumpster in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/24/nyregion/murderer-reveals-new-details-in-slaying-of-socialite-in-1998.html?ref=santekimes |title=Murderer Reveals New Details In Slaying of Socialite in 1998 ''Thomas J.

The FBI and [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] detectives assigned to the investigation focused on the [[mortgage]] loan application with the forged signature that falsely linked Kazdin to a house in Las Vegas which had been partly burned down in an attempted arson. The supposed homeowner turned out to be David McCarran, a homeless man who said Kimes and Kenny had lit the arson fire. He also claimed to have been forced to stay in the house by the Kimeses, who hoped to collect the insurance money from the loss of the house. \n\nInvestigators also located James Patterson, a second man who confessed to selling a handgun to Kenny which he used to kill Kazdin. He was told of several potential felony charges stemming from the murder and [[mortgage fraud]] and reluctantly agreed to cooperate with the police in apprehending the pair to avoid prosecution. \n\nAt the end of June 1998, Patterson got a call from Kimes about an expensive townhouse in [[New York City|New York]]'s [[Upper West Side]] she wanted to sell for $7.7 million (the building owned by Silverman), and she need his help with the paperwork. Patterson agreed to meet her in New York on July 5; he informed the FBI about the scheduled meeting before he left on July 3. Two days later, Patterson met Kimes at the [[New York Hilton]] around 6 p.m. that evening. Around 7 p.m., Kenny arrived at the Hilton and approached Kimes; upon his appearance FBI and [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] officers quickly moved in to arrest both of them. \n\nThe Kimeses had stolen a black [[Lincoln Town Car]] from a rental car dealership in [[Utah]] the previous May using a bounced check. When the police found the vehicle in the following day on July 6, they searched it and found what one officer called a \"treasure chest\" full of evidence: a [[stun gun]] case, forged Social Security cards, two hand guns, a pair of handcuffs, a folder full of various forms and applications related to Silverman's mansion, and a set of fifteen notebooks on which Sante had written detailed descriptions of mortgage fraud schemes involving many intended victims including both Silverman and Kazdin.\n\n== Trials ==\nAlthough the Kazdin murder occurred first, the Kimeses were tried in New York City first for the Silverman murder. Evidence recovered from their car helped establish the case for trying them for Kazdin's murder as well.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/69935467.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Mar+22%2C+2001&author=TWILA+DECKER&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&edition=&startpage=B.1&desc=Con+Artist+Is+Returned+to+L.A.+for+Murder+Trial%3B+Crime%3A+He+and+his+mother+are+accused+of+killing+a+local+businessman.+They+were+convicted+last+year+of+slaying+a+wealthy+New+York+woman |title=Con Artist Is Returned to L.A. for Murder Trial; Crime: He and his mother are accused of killing a local businessman.

Nonetheless, the jury was unanimous in voting to convict them not only of murder but of 117 other charges including robbery, [[burglary]], [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]], [[grand larceny]], illegal weapons possession, forgery and [[eavesdropping]] on their first poll on the subject.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/19/nyregion/mother-and-son-guilty-of-killing-a-socialite-who-vanished-in-98.html?ref=santekimes |title=Mother and Son Guilty of Killing A Socialite Who Vanished in '98 ''David Rhode, The New York Times, 5/19/2000'' |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2000-05-19 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}</ref> \n\nThe judge also took the unusual step of ordering Kimes not to speak to the media even after the jury had been [[Jury sequestration|sequestered]], as a result of her passing a note to ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter [[David Rhode]] in court. The judge threatened to have Kimes handcuffed during further court appearances if she persisted and restricted her telephone access to calls to her lawyers. The judge contended that Kimes was attempting to influence the jury as they may have seen or heard any such interviews, and that there would be no [[cross-examination]] as there would be in court. Kimes had earlier chosen to not take the stand in her own defense after the judge ruled that prosecutors could question her about the previous conviction on slavery charges.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/17/nyregion/sante-kimes-chastised-by-judge-over-contacts-with-news-media.html?ref=santekimes |title=Sante Kimes Chastised by Judge Over Contacts With News Media ''David Rhode, The New York Times, 5/17/2000'' |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2000-05-17 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}</ref>\n\nDuring the sentencing portion of the Silverman trial, Kimes made a prolonged statement to the court blaming the authorities, including their own lawyers, for framing them. She went on to compare their trial to the [[Salem Witch Trials]] and claimed that the prosecutors were guilty of \"murdering the Constitution\" before the judge told her to be quiet. When the statement was concluded, the presiding judge responded that Kimes was a [[Psychopathy|sociopath]] and a degenerate and her son was a dupe and a \"remorseless predator\" before imposing the maximum sentence on both of them.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/28/nyregion/mother-and-son-are-given-life-sentences.html?ref=santekimes |title=Mother and Son Are Given Life Sentences ''Katherine E. Finkelstein, The New York Times, 6/28/2000'' |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2000-06-28 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}</ref> This amounted to 120 years for Sante and 124 years for her son Kenny, effectively sentencing both of them to life in prison. \n\nIn October 2000, while doing an interview, Kenny held [[Court TV]] reporter Maria Zone hostage by pressing a ballpoint pen into her throat. Zone had interviewed Kimes once before without incident.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/11/nyregion/kenneth-kimes-takes-reporter-as-a-hostage.html |title=Kenneth Kimes Takes Reporter As a Hostage ''Shaila K. Dewan, The New York Times, 10/11/200'' |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2000-10-11 |accessdate=2011-04-10}}</ref> Kenny's demand was that his mother not be extradited to [[California]], where the two faced the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] for the murder of Kazdin. After four hours of negotiation, Kenny removed the pen from Zone's throat. Negotiators created a distraction which allowed them to quickly remove Zone and wrestle Kimes to the ground.\n\nIn March 2001, Kenny was extradited to Los Angeles to stand trial for the murder of Kazdin. Kimes was extradited to Los Angeles in June 2001. During that trial in June 2004, while he was facing the death penalty, Kenny changed his plea from \"not guilty\" to \"guilty\" and implicated his mother in the murder in exchange for a [[plea deal]] that his mother should not receive the death penalty if convicted. Kenny then testified in trial against his mother, exposing every detail about their multiple crimes and describing how she indoctrinated him into becoming her accomplice. Kimes again made a prolonged statement denying the murders and accusing police and prosecutors of various kinds of misconduct, and she was again eventually ordered by the presiding judge to be silent.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/653859091.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Jun+22%2C+2004&author=Anna+Gorman&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&edition=&startpage=B.4&desc=Sante+Kimes+Denies+1998+Slaying%3B+She+says+the+Granada+Hills+victim+was+her+%27best+friend%27+and+that+she+didn%27t+order+his+death |title=Sante Kimes Denies 1998 Slaying; She says the Granada Hills victim was her 'best friend' and that she didn't order his death.

[[Betel|Betel leaves]], [[areca]] (for chewing), and coconut were the principal cash crops, and large-scale cotton production supplied the weaving centers of the empire's vibrant textile industry. Spices such as [[turmeric]], pepper, [[cardamom]], and ginger grew in the remote [[Malnad]] hill region and were transported to the city for trade.

Different temple building traditions in South and Central India came together in the [[Vijayanagara Architecture]] style. This synthesis inspired architectural innovation in [[Hindu temples]]' construction. Efficient administration and vigorous overseas trade brought new technologies such as water management systems for irrigation. The empire's patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], and [[Sanskrit]], while [[Carnatic music]] evolved into its current form.

[[Betel|Betel leaves]], [[areca]] (for chewing), and coconut were the principal cash crops, and large-scale cotton production supplied the weaving centers of the empire's vibrant textile industry. Spices such as [[turmeric]], pepper, [[cardamom]], and ginger grew in the remote [[Malnad]] hill region and were transported to the city for trade.
