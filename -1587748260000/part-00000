He was a member of [[Hellyeah]] for 12 years from 2006 until his death in 2018. He also co-founded the heavy metal band [[Damageplan]] in 2003 with his younger brother, [[Dimebag Darrell]].\n\n==Early years==\nVincent Paul Abbott was born in [[Abilene, Texas]], on March 11, 1964. His parents were [[Jerry Abbott|Jerry]], a [[country music]] songwriter and producer, and Carolyn Abbott. Vincent originally played the [[tuba]] but was directed towards the drums by his father, who said there were no career prospects for a tuba player.

Bradford, and vocalist Donnie Hart. Upon Hart's departure, Terry Glaze assumed vocal duties. In the summer of 1982, Bradford left the band and was succeeded by [[Rex Brown]]. The band released three albums with that lineup.\n\nPantera recruited vocalist [[Phil Anselmo]] in 1987. By 1990, the band had been signed to Atco Records and released ''[[Cowboys from Hell]]'', which proved to be the band's turning point. Over the course of four more studio records, a live album and a [[The Best of Pantera: Far Beyond the Great Southern Cowboys' Vulgar Hits!|greatest hits compilation]], Anselmo and Pantera were nominated for four [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance|best metal performance Grammy]]s for the songs \"[[I'm Broken]]\", \"[[Suicide Note Pt. I]]\", \"[[Cemetery Gates]]\", and \"[[Revolution Is My Name]]\".\n\nIn 2001, Anselmo decided to put Pantera on hold because of [[degenerative disk disease|back pain]] while he toured and recorded with his side projects. Pantera's official disbandment took place in 2003 for several reasons, but mainly because of the ongoing dispute between Anselmo and the Abbott brothers, although Rex Brown remained neutral. In the years to follow, animosity would stir up between Abbott and Anselmo. Anselmo had publicly announced that he wished for Paul to forgive him and reform a friendship. However, Paul stated that he was not interested in speaking to Anselmo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/pantera-rex-brown-vinnie-paul-wont-speak-to-me-or-philip-anselmo/|title=Pantera's Rex Brown: Vinnie Paul Won't Speak to Me or Philip Anselmo|website=Loudwire|date=August 4, 2017|accessdate=June 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Damageplan===\n{{main|Damageplan}}\nAfter the breakup of Pantera, the Abbott brothers formed the heavy metal band [[Damageplan]] with former [[tattoo]] artist [[Bob Kakaha|Bob Zilla]] on bass and former [[Halford (band)|Halford]] guitarist [[Patrick Lachman|Pat Lachman]] on lead vocals.

Abbott recorded six studio albums with the band. In May 2019, it was announced that Hellyeah would tour for the first time since Abbott's death to support the final album he recorded with the band, ''[[Welcome Home (Hellyeah album)|Welcome Home]]''.

Over the course of four more studio records, a live album and a [[The Best of Pantera: Far Beyond the Great Southern Cowboys' Vulgar Hits!|greatest hits compilation]], Anselmo and Pantera were nominated for four [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance|best metal performance Grammy]]s for the songs \"[[I'm Broken]]\", \"[[Suicide Note Pt. I]]\", \"[[Cemetery Gates]]\", and \"[[Revolution Is My Name]]\".\n\nIn 2001, Anselmo decided to put Pantera on hold because of [[degenerative disk disease|back pain]] while he toured and recorded with his side projects. Pantera's official disbandment took place in 2003 for several reasons, but mainly because of the ongoing dispute between Anselmo and the Abbott brothers, although Rex Brown remained neutral. In the years to follow, animosity would stir up between Abbott and Anselmo. Anselmo had publicly announced that he wished for Paul to forgive him and reform a friendship. However, Paul stated that he was not interested in speaking to Anselmo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/pantera-rex-brown-vinnie-paul-wont-speak-to-me-or-philip-anselmo/|title=Pantera's Rex Brown: Vinnie Paul Won't Speak to Me or Philip Anselmo|website=Loudwire|date=August 4, 2017|accessdate=June 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Damageplan===\n{{main|Damageplan}}\nAfter the breakup of Pantera, the Abbott brothers formed the heavy metal band [[Damageplan]] with former [[tattoo]] artist [[Bob Kakaha|Bob Zilla]] on bass and former [[Halford (band)|Halford]] guitarist [[Patrick Lachman|Pat Lachman]] on lead vocals.

[[Cosmetology]], [[facial symmetry]], and [[waist\u2013hip ratio]] are three such examples where measurements are commonly thought to be fundamental.\n\n==Evolutionary science==\nAnthropometric studies today are conducted to investigate the evolutionary significance of differences in body proportion between populations whose ancestors lived in different environments. Human populations exhibit climatic variation patterns similar to those of other large-bodied mammals, following [[Bergmann's rule]], which states that individuals in cold climates will tend to be larger than ones in warm climates, and [[Allen's rule]], which states that individuals in cold climates will tend to have shorter, stubbier limbs than those in warm climates.\n\nOn a microevolutionary level, anthropologists use anthropometric variation to reconstruct small-scale population history. For instance, John Relethford's studies of early 20th-century anthropometric data from Ireland show that the geographical patterning of body proportions still exhibits traces of the invasions by the English and Norse centuries ago.\n\nSimilarly, anthropometric indices, namely comparison of the [[human stature]] was used to illustrate anthropometric trends. This study was conducted by [[J\u00f6rg Baten]] and Sandew Hira and was based on the anthropological founds that [[human height]] is predetermined by the [[Nutrition|quality of the nutrition]], which used to be higher in the more developed countries. The research was based on the datasets for [[Southern Chinese]] contract migrants who were sent to [[Suriname]] and [[Indonesia]] and included 13,000 individuals.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Baten |first1=J\u00f6rg |title=ANTHROPOMETRIC TRENDS IN SOUTHERN CHINA,1830\u20131864 |journal=Australian Economic History Review |date=November 2008 |volume= 48 |issue= 3|pages=209\u2013226 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8446.2008.00238.x }}</ref>\n\n==Measuring instruments==\n\n===3D body scanners===\nToday anthropometry can be performed with [[3D body scanning|three-dimensional scanners]]. A global collaborative study to examine the uses of three-dimensional scanners for health care was launched in March 2007. The Body Benchmark Study will investigate the use of three-dimensional scanners to calculate volumes and segmental volumes of an individual body scan. The aim is to establish whether the [[Body volume index|Body Volume Index]] has the potential to be used as a long-term computer-based anthropometric measurement for health care. In 2001 the UK conducted the largest sizing survey to date using scanners. Since then several national surveys have followed in the UK's pioneering steps, notably SizeUSA, SizeMexico, and SizeThailand, the latter still ongoing. SizeUK showed that the nation had become taller and heavier but not as much as expected. Since 1951, when the last women's survey had taken place, the average weight for women had gone up from 62 to 65&nbsp;kg. However, recent research has shown that posture of the participant significantly influences the measurements taken,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gill|first1=Simeon|last2=Parker|first2=Christopher J.|title=Scan posture definition and hip girth measurement: the impact on clothing design and body scanning|journal=Ergonomics|volume=60|issue=8|pages=1123\u20131136|doi=10.1080/00140139.2016.1251621|pmid=27764997|year=2017|url=https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/33471}}</ref> the precision of 3D body scanner may or may not be high enough for industry tolerances,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Parker|first1=Christopher J.|last2=GIll|first2=Simeon|last3=Hayes|first3=Steven G.|title=3D Body Scanning has Suitable Reliability: An Anthropometric Investigation for Garment Construction|journal=Proc.

Such measurements are used in research on [[neuroscience and intelligence]]. Brain volume data and other craniometric data are used in mainstream science to compare modern-day animal species and to analyze the evolution of the human species in archeology.\n\n==Epidemiology and medical anthropology==\nAnthropometric measurements also have uses in [[epidemiology]] and [[medical anthropology]], for example in helping to determine the relationship between various body measurements (height, weight, percentage body fat, etc.) and medical outcomes.  Anthropometric measurements are frequently used to diagnose [[malnutrition]] in resource-poor clinical settings.\n\n==Forensics and criminology==\n[[File:Fingerprints taken by William James Herschel 1859-1860.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An early set of [[fingerprint|finger- and handprint]]s by [[Sir William Herschel, 2nd Baronet]] (1833\u20131917)]]\n{{Further|Forensic anthropology|anthropological criminology}}\n\nForensic anthropologists study the human skeleton in a legal setting. A forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of a decedent through various skeletal analyses that produce a biological profile. Forensic anthropologists utilize the [[Fordisc]] program to help in the interpretation of craniofacial measurements in regards to ancestry or race determination.\n\nOne part of a biological profile is a person's racial or ancestral affinity. People with significant European or Middle Eastern ancestry generally have relatively no{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=December 2016}} [[prognathism]]; a relatively long and narrow face; a prominent brow ridge that protrudes forward from the forehead; a narrow, tear-shaped nasal cavity; a \"silled\" nasal aperture; tower-shaped nasal bones; a triangular-shaped palate; and an angular and sloping eye orbit shape. People with considerable African ancestry typically have a broad and round nasal cavity; no dam or nasal sill; Quonset hut-shaped nasal bones; notable facial projection in the jaw and mouth area (prognathism); a rectangular-shaped palate; and a square or rectangular eye orbit shape. A relatively small prognathism often characterizes people with considerable East Asian ancestry; no nasal sill or dam; an oval-shaped nasal cavity; tent-shaped nasal bones; a horseshoe-shaped palate; and a rounded and non-sloping eye orbit shape.<ref>[http://www.redwoods.edu/Instruct/AGarwin/anth_6_ancestry.htm Forensic Anthropology - Ancestry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206061745/http://www.redwoods.edu/instruct/agarwin/anth_6_ancestry.htm |date=2012-02-06 }}</ref> Many of these characteristics are only a matter of frequency among particular races: their presence or absence of one or more does not automatically classify an individual into a racial group.\n\n==Ergonomics==\n{{main|Human factors and ergonomics}}\nToday, ergonomics professionals apply an understanding of human factors to the design of equipment, systems and working methods to improve comfort, health, safety, and productivity.

The project collected and organized data on 2,400 U.S. & Canadian and 2,000 European civilians and a database was developed. This database records the anthropometric variability of men and women, aged 18\u201365, of various weights, ethnic groups, gender, geographic regions, and socio-economic status. The study was conducted from April 1998 to early 2000 and included three scans per person in a standing pose, full-coverage pose and relaxed seating pose. Data collection methods were standardized and documented so that the database can be consistently expanded and updated. High-resolution measurements of body surfaces were made using 3D Surface Anthropometry. This technology can capture hundreds of thousands of points in three dimensions on the human body surface in a few seconds. It has many advantages over the old measurement system using tape measures, anthropometers, and other similar instruments. It provides detail about the surface shape as well as 3D locations of measurements relative to each other and enables easy transfer to Computer-Aided Design (CAD) or Manufacturing (CAM) tools. The resulting scan is independent of the measurer, making it easier to standardize. Automatic landmark recognition (ALR) technology was used to extract anatomical landmarks from the 3D body scans automatically. Eighty landmarks were placed on each subject. More than 100 univariate measures were provided, over 60 from the scan and approximately 40 using traditional measurements. Demographic data such as age, ethnic group, gender, geographic region, education level, and present occupation, family income and more were also captured.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sae.org/standardsdev/tsb/cooperative/caefact.htm|title=CAESAR Fact Sheet|website=www.sae.org}}</ref><ref>Robinette, Kathleen M, Daanen, Hein A M, Precision of the CAESAR scan-extracted measurements, Applied Ergonomics, vol 37, issue 3, May 2007, pp. 259\u2013265.</ref>\n\n==Fashion design==\nScientists working for private companies and government agencies conduct anthropometric studies to determine a range of sizes for clothing and other items.

Anthropometry involves the systematic measurement of the physical properties of the human body, primarily dimensional descriptors of body size and shape.{{cn|date=March 2020}} Since commonly used methods and approaches in analysing living standards were not helpful enough, the anthropometric history became very useful for historians in answering questions that interested them.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baten|first=Joerg|last2=Komlos|first2=John|date=2004|title=Looking Backward and Looking Forward: Anthropometric Research and the Development of Social Science History|url= |journal=Social Science History|volume=28|pages=191\u2013210|via=Elsevier Science Direct}}</ref>\n\nToday, anthropometry plays an important role in [[industrial design]], [[clothing]] design, [[ergonomics]] and architecture where statistical data about the distribution of body dimensions in the population are used to optimize products.

[[Cosmetology]], [[facial symmetry]], and [[waist\u2013hip ratio]] are three such examples where measurements are commonly thought to be fundamental.\n\n==Evolutionary science==\nAnthropometric studies today are conducted to investigate the evolutionary significance of differences in body proportion between populations whose ancestors lived in different environments. Human populations exhibit climatic variation patterns similar to those of other large-bodied mammals, following [[Bergmann's rule]], which states that individuals in cold climates will tend to be larger than ones in warm climates, and [[Allen's rule]], which states that individuals in cold climates will tend to have shorter, stubbier limbs than those in warm climates.\n\nOn a microevolutionary level, anthropologists use anthropometric variation to reconstruct small-scale population history. For instance, John Relethford's studies of early 20th-century anthropometric data from Ireland show that the geographical patterning of body proportions still exhibits traces of the invasions by the English and Norse centuries ago.\n\nSimilarly, anthropometric indices, namely comparison of the [[human stature]] was used to illustrate anthropometric trends. This study was conducted by [[J\u00f6rg Baten]] and Sandew Hira and was based on the anthropological founds that [[human height]] is predetermined by the [[Nutrition|quality of the nutrition]], which used to be higher in the more developed countries.

The aim is to establish whether the [[Body volume index|Body Volume Index]] has the potential to be used as a long-term computer-based anthropometric measurement for health care. In 2001 the UK conducted the largest sizing survey to date using scanners. Since then several national surveys have followed in the UK's pioneering steps, notably SizeUSA, SizeMexico, and SizeThailand, the latter still ongoing.

The project collected and organized data on 2,400 U.S. & Canadian and 2,000 European civilians and a database was developed. This database records the anthropometric variability of men and women, aged 18\u201365, of various weights, ethnic groups, gender, geographic regions, and socio-economic status. The study was conducted from April 1998 to early 2000 and included three scans per person in a standing pose, full-coverage pose and relaxed seating pose. Data collection methods were standardized and documented so that the database can be consistently expanded and updated. High-resolution measurements of body surfaces were made using 3D Surface Anthropometry. This technology can capture hundreds of thousands of points in three dimensions on the human body surface in a few seconds. It has many advantages over the old measurement system using tape measures, anthropometers, and other similar instruments. It provides detail about the surface shape as well as 3D locations of measurements relative to each other and enables easy transfer to Computer-Aided Design (CAD) or Manufacturing (CAM) tools. The resulting scan is independent of the measurer, making it easier to standardize. Automatic landmark recognition (ALR) technology was used to extract anatomical landmarks from the 3D body scans automatically. Eighty landmarks were placed on each subject. More than 100 univariate measures were provided, over 60 from the scan and approximately 40 using traditional measurements. Demographic data such as age, ethnic group, gender, geographic region, education level, and present occupation, family income and more were also captured.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sae.org/standardsdev/tsb/cooperative/caefact.htm|title=CAESAR Fact Sheet|website=www.sae.org}}</ref><ref>Robinette, Kathleen M, Daanen, Hein A M, Precision of the CAESAR scan-extracted measurements, Applied Ergonomics, vol 37, issue 3, May 2007, pp. 259\u2013265.</ref>\n\n==Fashion design==\nScientists working for private companies and government agencies conduct anthropometric studies to determine a range of sizes for clothing and other items. For just one instance, measurements of the foot are used in the manufacture and sale of [[footwear]]: measurement devices may be used either to determine a retail shoe size directly (e.g. the [[Brannock Device]]) or to determine the detailed dimensions of the foot for custom manufacture (e.g. [[ALINEr]]).<ref>Goonetilleke, R.
