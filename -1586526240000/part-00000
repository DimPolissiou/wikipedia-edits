{"title_page": "Resistance during World War II", "text_new": "{{WWII timeline}}\n\n'''Resistance movements during World War II''' occurred in every occupied country by a variety of means, ranging from non-cooperation to propaganda to hiding crashed pilots and even to outright warfare and the recapturing of towns. In many countries, resistance movements were sometimes also\n\nAmong the most notable [[resistance movement]]s were the [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish Resistance]], including the [[Polish Home Army]], [[Le\u015bni]], and the whole [[Polish Underground State]]; [[Yugoslav Partisans]], the [[Soviet partisans]],{{Ref label|a|a|none}} the [[Italian resistance movement|Italian ''Resistenza'']] led mainly by the [[Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale|Italian CLN]]; the [[French Resistance]],  the [[Belgian Resistance]], the [[Norwegian resistance movement|Norwegian Resistance]], the [[Danish resistance movement|Danish Resistance]], the [[Greek Resistance]], the [[Czech resistance]], the [[Albanian resistance]], the [[Dutch resistance|Dutch Resistance]] especially the \"LO\" (national hiding organisation) and the [[Political repression|politically persecuted]] [[German resistance to Nazism|opposition in Germany]] itself (there were 16 main resistance groups and at least 27 failed [[List of assassination attempts on Adolf Hitler|attempts to assassinate Hitler]] with many more planned): in short, across [[German-occupied Europe]].\n\nMany countries had resistance movements dedicated to fighting or undermining the [[Axis Powers|Axis invaders]], and [[Nazi Germany]] itself also had an [[Widerstand|anti-Nazi movement]]. Although Britain was not occupied during the war, the British made complex preparations for a British resistance movement.  The main  organisation was created by the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS, aka [[MI6]]) and is now known as Section VII.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Fighting Nazi Occupation: British Resistance 1939-1945|last = Atkin|first = Malcolm|publisher = Pen and Sword|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1-47383-377-7|location = Barnsley|pages = Chapter 11}}</ref>  In addition there was a short-term secret commando force  called the [[Auxiliary Units]].<ref name=\"coleshillhouse.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.coleshillhouse.com/|title=British Resistance Archive \u2013 Churchill's Auxiliary Units \u2013 A comprehensive online resource.|website=www.coleshillhouse.com}}</ref>  Various organizations were also formed to establish foreign resistance cells or support existing resistance movements, like the British [[Special Operations Executive]] and the American [[Office of Strategic Services]] (the forerunner of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]).\n\nThere were also resistance movements fighting against the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] invaders. In [[Italian East Africa]], after the Italian forces were defeated during the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]], some Italians participated in a [[Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia|guerrilla war against the British]] (1941\u20131943). The German Nazi resistance movement (\"[[Werwolf]]\") never amounted to much. The \"[[Forest Brothers]]\" of [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] included many fighters who operated against the [[Occupation of Baltic States|Soviet occupation of the Baltic States]] into the 1960s. During or after the war, similar anti-Soviet resistance rose up in places like [[Romania]], [[Poland]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Chechnya]].\n\nWhile historians and governments of some European countries have attempted to portray resistance to Nazi occupation as widespread among their populations,<ref>Rosbottom, Ronald C. (2014), ''When Paris Went Dark,'' New York: Little, Brown and Company, pp. 198-199</ref> only a small minority of people participated in organized resistance, estimated at one to three percent of the population of countries in western Europe. In eastern Europe where Nazi rule was more oppressive, a larger percentage of people were in organized resistance movements, for example, an estimated 10-15 percent of the Polish population. Passive resistance by non-cooperation with the occupiers was much more common.<ref>Wieviorka, Olivier and Tebinka, Jacek, \"Resisters: From Everyday Life to Counter-state,\"  in ''Surviving Hitler and Mussolini'' (2006), eds: Robert Gildea, Olvier Wieviorka, and Anette Warring, Oxford: Berg, p. 153</ref>\n\n== Organization ==\nAfter the first shock following the [[Blitzkrieg]], people slowly started to get organized, both locally and on a larger scale, especially when [[Jews]] and other groups were starting to be deported and used for the ''[[Arbeitseinsatz]]'' ([[forced labor]] for the Germans). Organization was dangerous, so much resistance was done by individuals. The possibilities depended much on the terrain; where there were large tracts of uninhabited land, especially hills and forests, resistance could more easily get organised undetected. This favoured in particular the [[Soviet partisans]] in [[Eastern Europe]]. In the much more densely populated [[Netherlands]], the [[Biesbosch]] wilderness could be used to go into hiding. In [[northern Italy]], both the [[Alps]] and the [[Apennines]] offered shelter to partisan brigades, though many groups operated directly inside the major cities.\n\nThere were many different types of groups, ranging in activity from [[humanitarian aid]] to armed resistance, and sometimes cooperating to a varying degree. Resistance usually arose spontaneously, but was encouraged and helped mainly from London and Moscow.\n\n==Size==\n<!--a graph could be made combining the table from Yugoslav_Partisans#Composition and https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:AK-Soviet_partisans_numbers.JPG-->\nThe five largest resistance movements in Europe were the Dutch, the French, the Polish, the Soviet, and the Yugoslav; overall their size can be seen as comparable, particularly in the years 1941-1944.\n\nA number of sources note that the Polish [[Home Army]] was the largest resistance movement in Nazi-occupied Europe.

His first bomb detonated in front of the Ministry of aeronautics, and the second detonated in front of police headquarters. Both buildings were damaged and many Germans were injured.\n\nOn the 28th of October 1939 (anniversary of the establishing of Czechoslovakia in 1918) large demonstrations against Nazi occupation took place in Prague. Approximately 100 000 Czechs were concerned. Demonstrators crowded the streets in the city. German police had to disperse the demonstrators and began shooting in the evening. The first victim was baker V\u00e1clav Sedl\u00e1\u010dek, who was shot dead. The second victim was student Jan Opletal, who was seriously injured. He later died on the 11th of November. Another 15 people were badly injured and hundreds of people sustained minor injuries. Approximately 400 people were arrested.\n\nIn March 1940, a [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] unit of the first [[guerilla warfare|guerilla]] organization of the Second World War in Europe, led by Major [[Henryk Dobrza\u0144ski]] (Hubal) completely destroyed a [[battalion]] of German infantry in a skirmish near the Polish village of [[Huciska]]. A few days later in an ambush near the village of [[Sza\u0142asy]] it inflicted heavy casualties upon another German unit. As time progressed, resistance forces grew in size and number. To counter this threat, the German authorities formed a special 1,000 man-strong anti-partisan unit of combined [[SS]]-''Wehrmacht'' forces, including a [[Panzer]] group. Although Dobrza\u0144ski's unit never exceeded 300 men, the Germans fielded at least 8,000 men in the area to secure it.<ref>*Marek Szymanski: ''Oddzial majora Hubala'', Warszawa 1999, {{ISBN|978-83-912237-0-3}}</ref><ref>*[[Aleksandra Ziolkowska-Boehm]]: ''Polish Hero Roman Rodziewicz Fate of a Hubal Soldier in Auschwitz, Buchenwald and Postwar England, Lexington Books, 2013, {{ISBN|978-0-7391-8535-3}}</ref>\n\nIn 1940, [[Witold Pilecki]],  [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance]], presented to his superiors a plan to enter Germany's [[Auschwitz|Auschwitz concentration camp]], gather intelligence on the camp from the inside, and organize inmate resistance.<ref>Jozef Garlinski, Fighting Auschwitz: the Resistance Movement in the Concentration Camp, Fawcett, 1975, {{ISBN|978-0-449-22599-8}}, reprinted by Time Life Education, 1993. {{ISBN|978-0-8094-8925-1}}</ref> The [[Home Army]] approved this plan, provided him with a false identity card, and on 19 September 1940, he deliberately went out during a street roundup in Warsaw-[[\u0142apanka]], and was caught by the Germans along with other civilians and sent to Auschwitz.

It was the first Polish uprising and the first anti-Soviet uprising of World War II. Anti-Soviet Poles, most of them teenagers from local high schools, stormed the local [[Red Army]] barracks and a prison, in order to release Polish soldiers kept there.\n\n1940 was the year of establishing [[Warsaw Ghetto]] and infamous death camp [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] by the German Nazis in occupied Poland.\nAmong the many activities of Polish resistance and Polish people one was helping endangered Jews. Polish citizens have the world's highest count of individuals who have been recognized as [[Righteous Among the Nations]] by [[Yad Vashem]] as non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews from extermination during the [[Holocaust]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/righteous/statistics|title=Names of Righteous by Country|website=www.yadvashem.org}}</ref>\n\nOne of the events that helped the growth of the French Resistance was the targeting of the French Jews, Communists, Gypsies, homosexuals, Catholics, and others, forcing many into hiding. This in turn gave the French Resistance new people to incorporate into their political structures.\n\nThe 'Special Operations Executive' [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[World War II]] organisation. Following [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] approval, it was officially formed by [[Minister of Economic Warfare]] [[Hugh Dalton]] on 22 July 1940, to develop a spirit of resistance in the occupied countries and to prepare a [[fifth column]] of resistance fighters to engage in open opposition to the occupiers at such time that the United Kingdom was able to return to the continent.{{sfn|Foot|2004|p=14}} To aid in the transport of agents and the supply of the resistance fighters, a [[Royal Air Force Special Duty Service]] was developed. Whereas the [[Secret Intelligence Service|SIS]] was primarily involved in [[espionage]], the SOE and the resistance fighters were geared toward [[reconnaissance]] of German defenses and [[sabotage]]. In England the SOE was also involved in the formation of the [[Auxiliary Units]], a top secret [[stay-behind]] resistance organisation which would have been activated in the event of a [[Operation Sealion|German invasion of Britain]]. The SOE operated in all countries or former countries occupied by or attacked by the Axis forces, except where demarcation lines were agreed with Britain's principal allies (the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]]).\n\nAfter the war, the organisation was officially dissolved on 15 January 1946.\n\n=== 1941 ===\nIn February 1941, the [[Communist Party of the Netherlands|Dutch Communist Party]] organized a general strike in [[Amsterdam]] and surrounding cities, known as the [[February strike]], in protest against [[Antisemitism|anti-Jewish]] measures by the Nazi occupying force and violence by fascist street fighters against Jews. Several hundreds of thousands of people participated in the strike. The strike was put down by the Nazis and some participants were executed.\n\nIn April 1941, the [[Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation]] was established in the [[Province of Ljubljana]].

Organized as a military mini-state it existed throughout the autumn of 1941 in the western part of Serbia. The Republic was established by the Partisan resistance movement and its administrative center was in the town of U\u017eice.

It was the first organized armed uprising in then occupied Europe, and involved 32,000 people. Most of Montenegro was quickly liberated, except major cities where Italian forces were well fortified. On 12 August \u2014 after a major Italian offensive involving 5 divisions and 30,000 soldiers \u2014 the uprising collapsed as units were disintegrating; poor leadership occurred as well as collaboration. The final toll of July 13 uprising in Montenegro was 735 dead, 1120 wounded and 2070 captured Italians and 72 dead and 53 wounded Montenegrins.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nThe [[Battle of Loznica (1941)|Battle of Loznica]], 31 August 1941, [[Chetniks]] attacked and freed the town of [[Loznica]] in Serbia from the Germans.

The resistance finished successfully in August\u2013November 1944 when the independent [[North Macedonia|Macedonian state]] was formed, which was later added to the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]].\n\nDuring the time within which Hitler gave his anti-resistance ''[[Nacht und Nebel]]'' decree \u2013 made on the very day of the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] in the Pacific \u2013 the planning for Britain's [[Operation Anthropoid]] was underway, as a resistance move during World War II to assassinate [[Reinhard Heydrich]], the [[List of rulers of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|Deputy Protector of Bohemia and Moravia]] and the chief of the [[Final Solution]], by the [[Czech resistance to Nazi occupation|Czech resistance]] in Prague.

A national general strike, originating mainly in Wiltz, paralysed the country and forced the occupying German authorities to respond violently by sentencing 21 strikers to death.\n\nOn 27 May 1942 [[Operation Anthropoid]] took place.

The main Partisan force escaped into [[Serbia]].\n\nOn 19 April 1943, three members of the [[Belgian resistance]] movement were able to stop the [[Twentieth convoy]], which was the 20th prisoner transport in [[Belgium]] organised by the Germans during [[World War II]]. The exceptional action by members of the Belgian resistance occurred to free [[Jews|Jewish]] and [[Romani people|Romani]] (\"Gypsy\") civilians who were being transported by train from the Dossin army base located in [[Mechelen transit camp|Mechelen]], [[Belgium]] to the concentration camp [[Auschwitz]]. The 20th train convoy transported 1,631 Jews (men, women and children). Some of the prisoners were able to escape and marked this particular kind of liberation action by the Belgian resistance movement as unique in the European history of the [[Holocaust]].\n\nIn October 1943, [[Rescue of the Danish Jews|the rescue of the Danish Jews]] meant that nearly all of the Danish Jews were saved from KZ camps by the [[Danish resistance movement|Danish resistance]]. This action is considered one of the bravest and most significant displays of public defiance against the Nazis. However, the action was largely due to the personal intervention of German diplomat [[Georg Ferdinand Duckwitz]], who both leaked news of the intended round up of the Jews to both the Danish opposition and Jewish groups and negotiated with the Swedes to ensure Danish Jews would be accepted in Sweden.\n\nThe [[Battle of Sutjeska]] from 15 May-16 June 1943 was a joint attack of the Axis forces that once again attempted to destroy the main Yugoslav Partisan force, near the [[Sutjeska (river)|Sutjeska]] river in southeastern Bosnia. The Axis rallied 127,000 troops for the offensive, including German, [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Italian]], [[Independent State of Croatia|NDH]], [[Bulgaria]]n and [[Cossack]] units, as well as over 300 airplanes (under German operational command), against 18,000 soldiers of the primary Yugoslav Partisans operational group organised in 16 brigades. Facing almost exclusively German troops in the final encirclement, the Yugoslav Partisans finally succeeded in breaking out across the Sutjeska river through the lines of the German ''118th J\u00e4ger Division,'' ''104th J\u00e4ger Division'' and ''369th (Croatian) Infantry Division'' in the northwestern direction, towards eastern Bosnia. Three brigades and the central hospital with over 2,000 wounded remained surrounded and, following Hitler's instructions, German commander-in-chief General [[Alexander L\u00f6hr]] ordered and carried out their annihilation, including the wounded and unarmed medical personnel. In addition, Partisan troops suffered from a severe lack of food and medical supplies, and many were struck down by [[typhoid]]. However, the failure of the offensive marked a turning point for [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] during World War II.\n\n'''[[Operation Heads]]''' started\u2014an action of serial [[assassinations]] of the Nazi personnel sentenced to death by the [[Special Courts]] for crimes against Polish citizens in [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|occupied Poland]].

Both men were high-ranking Nazi German [[SS]] and secret police officers responsible for the murder and brutal interrogation of thousands of Polish Jews and Polish resistance fighters and supporters.\n\nThe [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] lasted from 19 April-16 May, and cost the Nazi forces 17 dead and 93 wounded.\n\nOn 30 September the [[Nazi Germany|German]] forces occupying the [[Italy|Italian]] city of [[Naples]] were forced out by the townsfolk and the [[Italian Resistance]] before the [[Allied invasion of Italy#Further Allied advances|arrival of the first Allied forces]] in the city on 1 October.

The operation was led by Major [[Patrick Leigh Fermor]], together with Captain [[W. Stanley Moss]], Greek [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] agents and [[Cretan resistance|Cretan resistance fighters]]. However, M\u00fcller left the island before the plan could be carried out. Undeterred, Fermor decided to abduct [[Heinrich Kreipe|General Heinrich Kreipe]] instead.\n\nOn the night of 26 April, General Kreipe left his headquarters in [[Archanes]] and headed without escort to his well-guarded residence, \"Villa Ariadni\", approximately {{convert|50|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}}25&nbsp;km outside [[Heraklion]]. Major Fermor and Captain Moss, dressed as German military policemen, waited for him {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}} before his residence. They asked the driver to stop and asked for their papers. As soon as the car stopped, Fermor quickly opened Kreipe's door, rushed in and threatened him with his guns while Moss took the driver's seat. After driving some distance the British left the car, with suitable decoy material being planted that suggesting an escape off the island had been made by [[submarine]], and with the General began a cross-country march. Hunted by German patrols, the group moved across the mountains to reach the southern side of the island, where a British [[Motor Launch]] (''ML 842'', commanded by Brian Coleman)  was to pick them up. Eventually, on 14 May 1944, they were picked up (from Peristeres beach near Rhodakino) and transferred to Egypt.\n\nIn April\u2013May 1944, the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] launched the daring airborne [[Raid on Drvar]] aimed at capturing Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]], the commander-in-chief of the [[Yugoslav Partisans]], as well as disrupting their leadership and command structure. The Partisan headquarters were in the hills near [[Drvar]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] at the time. The representatives of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s [[Randolph Churchill]] and [[Evelyn Waugh]], were also present. Elite German SS parachute commando units fought their way to Tito's [[cave]] headquarters and exchanged heavy gunfire resulting in numerous casualties on both sides.<ref>pp. 343-376, Eyre</ref> [[Chetniks]] under [[Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107]] also flocked to the firefight in their own attempt to capture Tito. By the time German forces had penetrated to the cave, however, Tito had already fled the scene. He had a train waiting for him that took him to the town of [[Jajce]]. It would appear that Tito and his staff were well prepared for emergencies. The commandos were only able to retrieve Tito\u2019s marshal's uniform, which was later displayed in [[Vienna]]. After fierce fighting in and around the village cemetery, the Germans were able to link up with mountain troops. By that time, Tito, his British guests and [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] survivors were f\u00eated aboard the [[Royal Navy]] [[destroyer]] {{HMS|Blackmore||6}} and her captain Lt. Carson, RN.\n\nAn intricate series of resistance operations were launched in France prior to, and during, [[Operation Overlord]].\nOn June 5, 1944, the [[BBC]] broadcast a group of unusual sentences, which the Germans knew were code words\u2014possibly for the invasion of Normandy. The BBC would regularly transmit hundreds of personal messages, of which only a few were really significant. A few days before D-Day, the commanding officers of the Resistance heard the first line of [[Paul Verlaine|Verlaine's]] poem, \"[[Chanson d'automne]]\", ''\"Les sanglots longs des violons de l'automne\"'' (''Long sobs of autumn violins'') which meant that the \"day\" was imminent. When the second line ''\"Blessent mon c\u0153ur d'une langueur monotone\"'' (''wound my heart with a monotonous langour'') was heard, the Resistance knew that the invasion would take place within the next 48 hours. They then knew it was time to go about their respective pre-assigned missions. All over France resistance groups had been coordinated, and various groups throughout the country increased their sabotage. Communications were cut, trains derailed, roads, water towers and ammunition depots destroyed and German garrisons were attacked.

Victory did not come easily; in June and July, in the [[Vercors plateau]] a newly reinforced maquis group fought more than 10,000 German soldiers (no Waffen-SS) under General Karl Pflaum and was defeated, with 840 casualties (639 fighters and 201 civilians). Following the [[Tulle Murders]], Major Otto Diekmann's Waffen-SS company wiped out the village of [[Oradour-sur-Glane]] on 10 June.

Its sinking effectively ended Nazi nuclear ambitions.

The confusion often stems from the fact that as war progressed, some resistance movements grew larger \u2013 and other diminished. In particular, Polish and Soviet territories were mostly freed from Nazi German control in the years 1944-1945, eliminating the need for their respective (anti-Nazi) partisan forces (in Poland, [[cursed soldiers]] continued to fight against the Soviets). Fighting in Yugoslavia, however, with Yugoslavian partisans fighting German units, [[Yugoslavia in World War II#Partisan General Offensive|continued till the end of the war]]. The numbers for each of those three movements can be roughly estimated as approaching 100,000 in 1941, and 200,000 in 1942, with Polish and Soviet partisan numbers peaking around 1944 at 350,000-400,000, and Yugoslavian, growing till the very end till they reached the 800,000.<ref name=\"Vuk\u0161i\u01072003\"/><ref name=\"Vuk\u0161i\u01072003\"/><ref name=ac/>\n\nSeveral sources note that Polish [[Armia Krajowa]] was the largest resistance movement in [[German-occupied Europe|Nazi-occupied Europe]].

In many countries, resistance movements were sometimes also referred to as '''The Underground'''.\n\nAmong the most notable [[resistance movement]]s were the [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish Resistance]], including the [[Polish Home Army]], [[Le\u015bni]], and the whole [[Polish Underground State]]; [[Yugoslav Partisans]], the [[Soviet partisans]],{{Ref label|a|a|none}} the [[Italian resistance movement|Italian ''Resistenza'']] led mainly by the [[Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale|Italian CLN]]; the [[French Resistance]],  the [[Belgian Resistance]], the [[Norwegian resistance movement|Norwegian Resistance]], the [[Danish resistance movement|Danish Resistance]], the [[Greek Resistance]], the [[Czech resistance]], the [[Albanian resistance]], the [[Dutch resistance|Dutch Resistance]] especially the \"LO\" (national hiding organisation) and the [[Political repression|politically persecuted]] [[German resistance to Nazism|opposition in Germany]] itself (there were 16 main resistance groups and at least 27 failed [[List of assassination attempts on Adolf Hitler|attempts to assassinate Hitler]] with many more planned): in short, across [[German-occupied Europe]].\n\nMany countries had resistance movements dedicated to fighting or undermining the [[Axis Powers|Axis invaders]], and [[Nazi Germany]] itself also had an [[Widerstand|anti-Nazi movement]]. Although Britain was not occupied during the war, the British made complex preparations for a British resistance movement.  The main  organisation was created by the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS, aka [[MI6]]) and is now known as Section VII.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Fighting Nazi Occupation: British Resistance 1939-1945|last = Atkin|first = Malcolm|publisher = Pen and Sword|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1-47383-377-7|location = Barnsley|pages = Chapter 11}}</ref>  In addition there was a short-term secret commando force  called the [[Auxiliary Units]].<ref name=\"coleshillhouse.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.coleshillhouse.com/|title=British Resistance Archive \u2013 Churchill's Auxiliary Units \u2013 A comprehensive online resource.|website=www.coleshillhouse.com}}</ref>  Various organizations were also formed to establish foreign resistance cells or support existing resistance movements, like the British [[Special Operations Executive]] and the American [[Office of Strategic Services]] (the forerunner of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]).\n\nThere were also resistance movements fighting against the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] invaders. In [[Italian East Africa]], after the Italian forces were defeated during the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]], some Italians participated in a [[Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia|guerrilla war against the British]] (1941\u20131943). The German Nazi resistance movement (\"[[Werwolf]]\") never amounted to much. The \"[[Forest Brothers]]\" of [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] included many fighters who operated against the [[Occupation of Baltic States|Soviet occupation of the Baltic States]] into the 1960s. During or after the war, similar anti-Soviet resistance rose up in places like [[Romania]], [[Poland]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Chechnya]].\n\nWhile historians and governments of some European countries have attempted to portray resistance to Nazi occupation as widespread among their populations,<ref>Rosbottom, Ronald C. (2014), ''When Paris Went Dark,'' New York: Little, Brown and Company, pp. 198-199</ref> only a small minority of people participated in organized resistance, estimated at one to three percent of the population of countries in western Europe. In eastern Europe where Nazi rule was more oppressive, a larger percentage of people were in organized resistance movements, for example, an estimated 10-15 percent of the Polish population. Passive resistance by non-cooperation with the occupiers was much more common.<ref>Wieviorka, Olivier and Tebinka, Jacek, \"Resisters: From Everyday Life to Counter-state,\"  in ''Surviving Hitler and Mussolini'' (2006), eds: Robert Gildea, Olvier Wieviorka, and Anette Warring, Oxford: Berg, p. 153</ref>\n\n== Organization ==\nAfter the first shock following the [[Blitzkrieg]], people slowly started to get organized, both locally and on a larger scale, especially when [[Jews]] and other groups were starting to be deported and used for the ''[[Arbeitseinsatz]]'' ([[forced labor]] for the Germans). Organization was dangerous, so much resistance was done by individuals. The possibilities depended much on the terrain; where there were large tracts of uninhabited land, especially hills and forests, resistance could more easily get organised undetected. This favoured in particular the [[Soviet partisans]] in [[Eastern Europe]]. In the much more densely populated [[Netherlands]], the [[Biesbosch]] wilderness could be used to go into hiding. In [[northern Italy]], both the [[Alps]] and the [[Apennines]] offered shelter to partisan brigades, though many groups operated directly inside the major cities.\n\nThere were many different types of groups, ranging in activity from [[humanitarian aid]] to armed resistance, and sometimes cooperating to a varying degree. Resistance usually arose spontaneously, but was encouraged and helped mainly from London and Moscow.\n\n==Size==\n<!--a graph could be made combining the table from Yugoslav_Partisans#Composition and https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:AK-Soviet_partisans_numbers.JPG-->\nThe five largest resistance movements in Europe were the Dutch, the French, the Polish, the Soviet, and the Yugoslav; overall their size can be seen as comparable, particularly in the years 1941-1944.\n\nA number of sources note that the Polish [[Home Army]] was the largest resistance movement in Nazi-occupied Europe.

Following [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] approval, it was officially formed by [[Minister of Economic Warfare]] [[Hugh Dalton]] on 22 July 1940, to develop a spirit of resistance in the occupied countries and to prepare a [[fifth column]] of resistance fighters to engage in open opposition to the occupiers at such time that the United Kingdom was able to return to the continent.{{sfn|Foot|2004|p=14}} To aid in the transport of agents and the supply of the resistance fighters, a [[Royal Air Force Special Duty Service]] was developed. Whereas the [[Secret Intelligence Service|SIS]] was primarily involved in [[espionage]], the SOE and the resistance fighters were geared toward [[reconnaissance]] of German defenses and [[sabotage]]. In England the SOE was also involved in the formation of the [[Auxiliary Units]], a top secret [[stay-behind]] resistance organisation which would have been activated in the event of a [[Operation Sealion|German invasion of Britain]]. The SOE operated in all countries or former countries occupied by or attacked by the Axis forces, except where demarcation lines were agreed with Britain's principal allies (the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]]).\n\nAfter the war, the organisation was officially dissolved on 15 January 1946.\n\n=== 1941 ===\nIn February 1941, the [[Communist Party of the Netherlands|Dutch Communist Party]] organized a general strike in [[Amsterdam]] and surrounding cities, known as the [[February strike]], in protest against [[Antisemitism|anti-Jewish]] measures by the Nazi occupying force and violence by fascist street fighters against Jews.

It was the first organized armed uprising in then occupied Europe, and involved 32,000 people. Most of Montenegro was quickly liberated, except major cities where Italian forces were well fortified. On 12 August \u2014 after a major Italian offensive involving 5 divisions and 30,000 soldiers \u2014 the uprising collapsed as units were disintegrating; poor leadership occurred as well as collaboration.

The main Partisan force escaped into [[Serbia]].\n\nOn 19 April 1943, three members of the [[Belgian resistance]] movement were able to stop the [[Twentieth convoy]], which was the 20th prisoner transport in [[Belgium]] organised by the Germans during [[World War II]]. The exceptional action by members of the Belgian resistance occurred to free [[Jews|Jewish]] and [[Romani people|Romani]] (\"Gypsy\") civilians who were being transported by train from the Dossin army base located in [[Mechelen transit camp|Mechelen]], [[Belgium]] to the concentration camp [[Auschwitz]]. The 20th train convoy transported 1,631 Jews (men, women and children). Some of the prisoners were able to escape and marked this particular kind of liberation action by the Belgian resistance movement as unique in the European history of the [[Holocaust]].\n\nIn October 1943, [[Rescue of the Danish Jews|the rescue of the Danish Jews]] meant that nearly all of the Danish Jews were saved from KZ camps by the [[Danish resistance movement|Danish resistance]]. This action is considered one of the bravest and most significant displays of public defiance against the Nazis. However, the action was largely due to the personal intervention of German diplomat [[Georg Ferdinand Duckwitz]], who both leaked news of the intended round up of the Jews to both the Danish opposition and Jewish groups and negotiated with the Swedes to ensure Danish Jews would be accepted in Sweden.\n\nThe [[Battle of Sutjeska]] from 15 May-16 June 1943 was a joint attack of the Axis forces that once again attempted to destroy the main Yugoslav Partisan force, near the [[Sutjeska (river)|Sutjeska]] river in southeastern Bosnia. The Axis rallied 127,000 troops for the offensive, including German, [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Italian]], [[Independent State of Croatia|NDH]], [[Bulgaria]]n and [[Cossack]] units, as well as over 300 airplanes (under German operational command), against 18,000 soldiers of the primary Yugoslav Partisans operational group organised in 16 brigades. Facing almost exclusively German troops in the final encirclement, the Yugoslav Partisans finally succeeded in breaking out across the Sutjeska river through the lines of the German ''118th J\u00e4ger Division,'' ''104th J\u00e4ger Division'' and ''369th (Croatian) Infantry Division'' in the northwestern direction, towards eastern Bosnia. Three brigades and the central hospital with over 2,000 wounded remained surrounded and, following Hitler's instructions, German commander-in-chief General [[Alexander L\u00f6hr]] ordered and carried out their annihilation, including the wounded and unarmed medical personnel. In addition, Partisan troops suffered from a severe lack of food and medical supplies, and many were struck down by [[typhoid]]. However, the failure of the offensive marked a turning point for [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] during World War II.\n\n'''[[Operation Heads]]''' started\u2014an action of serial [[assassinations]] of the Nazi personnel sentenced to death by the [[Special Courts]] for crimes against Polish citizens in [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|occupied Poland]].

Both men were high-ranking Nazi German [[SS]] and secret police officers responsible for the murder and brutal interrogation of thousands of Polish Jews and Polish resistance fighters and supporters.\n\nThe [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] lasted from 19 April-16 May, and cost the Nazi forces 17 dead and 93 wounded.\n\nOn 30 September the [[Nazi Germany|German]] forces occupying the [[Italy|Italian]] city of [[Naples]] were forced out by the townsfolk and the [[Italian Resistance]] before the [[Allied invasion of Italy#Further Allied advances|arrival of the first Allied forces]] in the city on 1 October.

The operation was led by Major [[Patrick Leigh Fermor]], together with Captain [[W. Stanley Moss]], Greek [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] agents and [[Cretan resistance|Cretan resistance fighters]]. However, M\u00fcller left the island before the plan could be carried out. Undeterred, Fermor decided to abduct [[Heinrich Kreipe|General Heinrich Kreipe]] instead.\n\nOn the night of 26 April, General Kreipe left his headquarters in [[Archanes]] and headed without escort to his well-guarded residence, \"Villa Ariadni\", approximately {{convert|50|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}}25&nbsp;km outside [[Heraklion]]. Major Fermor and Captain Moss, dressed as German military policemen, waited for him {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}} before his residence. They asked the driver to stop and asked for their papers. As soon as the car stopped, Fermor quickly opened Kreipe's door, rushed in and threatened him with his guns while Moss took the driver's seat. After driving some distance the British left the car, with suitable decoy material being planted that suggesting an escape off the island had been made by [[submarine]], and with the General began a cross-country march. Hunted by German patrols, the group moved across the mountains to reach the southern side of the island, where a British [[Motor Launch]] (''ML 842'', commanded by Brian Coleman)  was to pick them up. Eventually, on 14 May 1944, they were picked up (from Peristeres beach near Rhodakino) and transferred to Egypt.\n\nIn April\u2013May 1944, the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] launched the daring airborne [[Raid on Drvar]] aimed at capturing Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]], the commander-in-chief of the [[Yugoslav Partisans]], as well as disrupting their leadership and command structure. The Partisan headquarters were in the hills near [[Drvar]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] at the time. The representatives of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s [[Randolph Churchill]] and [[Evelyn Waugh]], were also present. Elite German SS parachute commando units fought their way to Tito's [[cave]] headquarters and exchanged heavy gunfire resulting in numerous casualties on both sides.<ref>pp. 343-376, Eyre</ref> [[Chetniks]] under [[Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107]] also flocked to the firefight in their own attempt to capture Tito. By the time German forces had penetrated to the cave, however, Tito had already fled the scene. He had a train waiting for him that took him to the town of [[Jajce]]. It would appear that Tito and his staff were well prepared for emergencies. The commandos were only able to retrieve Tito\u2019s marshal's uniform, which was later displayed in [[Vienna]]. After fierce fighting in and around the village cemetery, the Germans were able to link up with mountain troops. By that time, Tito, his British guests and [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] survivors were f\u00eated aboard the [[Royal Navy]] [[destroyer]] {{HMS|Blackmore||6}} and her captain Lt. Carson, RN.\n\nAn intricate series of resistance operations were launched in France prior to, and during, [[Operation Overlord]].\nOn June 5, 1944, the [[BBC]] broadcast a group of unusual sentences, which the Germans knew were code words\u2014possibly for the invasion of Normandy. The BBC would regularly transmit hundreds of personal messages, of which only a few were really significant. A few days before D-Day, the commanding officers of the Resistance heard the first line of [[Paul Verlaine|Verlaine's]] poem, \"[[Chanson d'automne]]\", ''\"Les sanglots longs des violons de l'automne\"'' (''Long sobs of autumn violins'') which meant that the \"day\" was imminent. When the second line ''\"Blessent mon c\u0153ur d'une langueur monotone\"'' (''wound my heart with a monotonous langour'') was heard, the Resistance knew that the invasion would take place within the next 48 hours. They then knew it was time to go about their respective pre-assigned missions. All over France resistance groups had been coordinated, and various groups throughout the country increased their sabotage. Communications were cut, trains derailed, roads, water towers and ammunition depots destroyed and German garrisons were attacked. Some relayed info about German defensive positions on the beaches of Normandy to American and British commanders by radio, just prior to 6 June. Victory did not come easily; in June and July, in the [[Vercors plateau]] a newly reinforced maquis group fought more than 10,000 German soldiers (no Waffen-SS) under General Karl Pflaum and was defeated, with 840 casualties (639 fighters and 201 civilians). Following the [[Tulle Murders]], Major Otto Diekmann's Waffen-SS company wiped out the village of [[Oradour-sur-Glane]] on 10 June. The resistance also assisted the later Allied invasion in the south of France ([[Operation Dragoon]]).\nThey started insurrections in cities such as [[Liberation of Paris|Paris]] when allied forces came close.\n\n[[Operation Halyard]], which took place between August and December 1944,<ref name=\"Pe\u0161i\u01072004\">{{cite book|author=Miodrag D.

The series of raids on the plant was later dubbed by the British [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] as the most successful act of sabotage in all of World War II, and was used as a basis for the US war movie ''[[The Heroes of Telemark]]''.\n\nAs an initiation of their uprising, [[Slovak National Uprising|Slovakian rebels]] entered Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica on the morning of 30 August 1944, the second day of the rebellion, and made it their headquarters. By 10 September, the insurgents gained control of large areas of central and eastern Slovakia. That included two captured airfields, and as a result of the two-week-old insurgency, the Soviet Air Force were able to begin flying in equipment to Slovakian and Soviet partisans.\n\n== Resistance

The confusion often stems from the fact that as war progressed, some resistance movements grew larger \u2013 and other diminished. In particular, Polish and Soviet territories were mostly freed from Nazi German control in the years 1944-1945, eliminating the need for their respective (anti-Nazi) partisan forces (in Poland, [[cursed soldiers]] continued to fight against the Soviets). Fighting in Yugoslavia, however, with Yugoslavian partisans fighting German units, [[Yugoslavia in World War II#Partisan General Offensive|continued till the end of the war]]. The numbers for each of those three movements can be roughly estimated as approaching 100,000 in 1941, and 200,000 in 1942, with Polish and Soviet partisan numbers peaking around 1944 at 350,000-400,000, and Yugoslavian, growing till the very end till they reached the 800,000.<ref name=\"Vuk\u0161i\u01072003\"/><ref name=\"Vuk\u0161i\u01072003\"/><ref name=ac/>\n\nSeveral sources note that Polish [[Armia Krajowa]] was the largest resistance movement in [[German-occupied Europe|Nazi-occupied Europe]]. For example, [[Norman Davies]] wrote \"Armia Krajowa (Home Army), the AK, which could fairly claim to be the largest of European resistance\";<ref>[[Norman Davies]], ''God's Playground: A History of Poland'', Columbia University\nPress, 2005, {{ISBN|0-231-12819-3}}, [https://archive.org/details/godsplaygroundhi00norm_0/page/344 <!-- quote=\"Armia Krajowa\" largest. --> Google Print p.344]</ref> [[Gregor Dallas]] wrote \"Home Army (Armia Krajowa or AK) in late 1943 numbered around 400,000, making it the largest resistance organization in Europe\";<ref name=\"Google Print, p.79\"/> [[Mark Wyman]] wrote \"Armia Krajowa was considered the largest underground resistance unit in wartime Europe\".<ref>Mark Wyman, ''DPs: Europe's Displaced Persons, 1945-1951'', Cornell University Press, 1998, {{ISBN|0-8014-8542-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lHNw7MnsmlYC&pg=PA34&dq=%22Armia+Krajowa%22+largest&lr=&as_brr=3&ei=NzzMR_mOIJGSzQSb7cSwCQ&sig=kv3oN5z3YgAgcT8Vgy4aIFRHknE Google Print, p.34]</ref> Certainly, Polish resistance was the largest resistance till German [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] and [[invasion of the Soviet Union]] in 1941.\n\nAfter that point, the numbers of [[Soviet partisans]] and [[Yugoslav partisans]] begun growing rapidly. The numbers of [[Soviet partisans]] quickly caught up and were very similar to that of the Polish resistance (a graph is also available [[:File:AK-Soviet partisans numbers.JPG|here]]).<ref name=\"Vuk\u0161i\u01072003\"/><ref>See for example: Leonid D.

Ravinder Reddy under Dwaraka Creations banner. It stars [[Bellamkonda Sreenivas]], [[Rakul Preet Singh]] and [[Jagapathi Babu]] in the lead roles while [[Pragya Jaiswal]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.tupaki.com/movienews/article/Boyapati-Srinu-Jaya-Janaki-Nayaka/54710 |title=Jagapathi Babu (Role) |work=Tupaki.com}}</ref> in an extended cameo and [[Suman (actor)|Suman]], [[Tarun Arora]], and [[Sarath Kumar]] play other pivotal roles. The music was composed by [[Devi Sri Prasad]]. The film was released on 11 August 2017 with mixed reviews from critics and audiences. It was a moderate success at the box office.\n\n==Plot== \nSweety ([[Rakul Preet Singh]]) is a college-going student. Her friend leaves college because an eve teaser, the son of the Central Minister ([[Suman (actor)|Suman]]), bothers her. When he comes to trouble her for supporting her friend, he gets beaten up by a co-student named Gagan Chakravarthy ([[Bellamkonda Sreenivas]]), his father Chakravarthy ([[Sarath Kumar]]), and his brother Pruthvi (Nandu). The CM then makes it a point to take Gagan and his family down.\n\nGagan, Chakravarthy, and Pruthvi are best friends and liquor buddies and only have each other, since Gagan's and Pruthvi's mother died (Chakravarthy's wife). They do everything from drinking alcohol to eating roadside foods and beating up wrongdoers in society. Sweety starts getting attracted to Gagan, and they start to hang out, and she gets to know about his family. She comes to Gagan's house and makes a change in their lifestyle for their own sake, for which Chakravarthy happily agrees for. In the meantime, Sweety, learns about Pruthvi's love failure and ends up reconciling with the would-be bride's parents, and the marriage is conducted in a grand manner. Chakravarthy, upon seeing the happiness and joy in the atmosphere at the wedding, realizes that Sweety is the reason behind everything and asks Gagan to always be by her side, and if he is not by her side one day, then Chakravarthy and his family as good as dead.\n\nIn a parallel track, the CM attends the engagement of the daughter of a very rich and ruthless businessman, Aswith Narayana Varma's ([[Jagapathi Babu]]). The would-be groom, however, finds a video of Narayana's daughter romancing and kissing another guy that she liked before the engagement. The groom shows Narayana and tells him about this. The next morning, in breaking news on TV, it is revealed that Narayana has intentionally killed the groom in fear of his pride being destroyed. Narayana says that the thing that he cares about the most in the world in his pride, and he will go to any extent to preserve it. He leaves a gun on the table, and his daughter picks it up and shoots herself.\n\nNarayana and his company plan to build a highway that will make his company the most successful company in all of Asia, but his son Veerendra ([[Shashank (actor)|Shashank]]) reveals that the project has competition in the form of the biggest liquor don in North India, Arjun Pawar ([[Tarun Arora]]). Arjun is supported by his two brothers and has bought off all of Narayana's close associates and subordinates except for his lawyer JP ([[Jayaprakash]]). Arjun threatens JP, stating that if he does not agree to his terms, that his daughter should marry his youngest brother; otherwise, he will kill her. JP agrees out of fear. Narayana, however, retaliates and sends Veerendra to kill Arjun's brother and breaks up the back and puts him in a critical condition. Now, Arjun then decides to hit back.\n\nSweety realizes that she is truly in love with Gagan and expresses her feelings towards him. Gagan is delighted, and Sweety takes him to her house to her father JP, where he insults him after realizing his lifestyle and the reputation that Chakravarthy has in society, then proceeds to insult Sweety. Enraged, Gagan gives JP a warning, but Sweety, who cares for her father's life more than anything, sends Gagan away and tells him to never come back.\n\nHeartbroken, Gagan drives and tries to forget Sweety but is unable to and gets into a car accident. Fearing for his life, Chakravarthy and his uncle send him away with known relatives in Vizag. Faluguni ([[Pragya Jaiswal]]) arrives at the airport and picks Gagan up, and Gagan realizes that her lifestyle is young, wild, and free. Falguni, however, has no interest in Gagan romantically. While driving back after a party on the beach. Gagan witnesses a family being attacked. He decides to save them, and they turn out to be Narayana's family, and Arjun's brother has been sent to finish them off. Narayana's family pleads Gagan to save them and their daughter-in-law. Gagan fights off some of Pawar's men and saves the daughter-in-law, who happens to be Sweety. Shocked, Gagan is then shot four times and is left for dead. The doctors end up saving him, and then the flashback is revealed by Narayana's wife ([[Sithara (actress)|Sithara]]). \n\nAfter breaking Arjun's brother's back, Narayana then met JP, and they decide to get Veerendra married with Sweety. At the wedding, as Veerendra is about to tie the knot, he is shot and killed, and Arjun's men come and kidnap everyone to kill them. Since Veerendra died at the hands of Arjun, JP has no choice but to let her daughter away from the Narayana family. However, Narayana's sister ([[Vani Viswanath]]) phones her brother and tells him that they need Sweety, since she is almost married to Veerendra, and decided to adopt Sweety as their daughter-in-law. Since her would-be husband is dead, Sweety becomes a poor widow with no family emotions. Gagan then vows to protect Sweety until he dies and will solve all her problems. Narayana's sister comes and says that the family must perform a pooja at the Hamsala Deevi river area. She sees Gagan, who says that he cannot come along. Narayana's sister, in reality, has cut a deal with Arjun to get Sweety and leave her family alone, and Arun agrees. As Narayana and the rest of his family perform the pooja, they attacked by Arjun's men. As they are about to attack Sweety, Gagan emerges from the water along with Chakravarthy and Nandu and kills everyone. He takes Sweety along with him, and Narayana feels that his pride has once again been damaged. Then, the CM enrages both Narayana and Arjun on Gagan, so they both join hands with each other in eliminating Gagan once and for all.\n\nIn the attack, Chakravarthy and Pruthvi are seriously injured, and Narayana kidnaps Sweety. Gagan then lugs his injured brother and father to where Sweety is being kept and kills everyone but Narayana. Finally, Gagan says that Narayana lost his pride a long time ago. As Narayana is listening to this, he shoots himself and dies. Chakravarthy decides to get Gagan married to Sweety and asks what name she would like on the wedding card. Sweety says \"Janaki\", and the film ends on a happy note.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Bellamkonda Sreenivas]] as Gagan Chakravarthy\n*[[Rakul Preet Singh]] as Janaki (Sweety)\n*[[Pragya Jaiswal]] as Falguni (extended cameo appearance)\n*[[R.

Ravinder Reddy under Dwaraka Creations banner. It stars [[Bellamkonda Sreenivas]], [[Rakul Preet Singh]] and [[Jagapathi Babu]] in the lead roles while [[Pragya Jaiswal]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.tupaki.com/movienews/article/Boyapati-Srinu-Jaya-Janaki-Nayaka/54710 |title=Jagapathi Babu (Role) |work=Tupaki.com}}</ref>,in an extended cameo and [[Suman (actor)|Suman]], [[Tarun Arora]], and [[Sarath Kumar]] play other pivotal roles. The music was composed by [[Devi Sri Prasad]]. The film was released on 11 August 2017 with mixed reviews from critics and audiences. It was a moderate success at the box office.\n\n==Plot== \nSweety ([[Rakul Preet Singh]]) is a college-going student. Her friend leaves college because an eve teaser, the son of the Central Minister ([[Suman (actor)|Suman]]), bothers her. When he comes to trouble her for supporting her friend, he gets beaten up by a co-student named Gagan Chakravarthy ([[Bellamkonda Sreenivas]]), his father Chakravarthy ([[Sarath Kumar]]), and his brother Pruthvi (Nandu). The CM then makes it a point to take Gagan and his family down.\n\nGagan, Chakravarthy, and Pruthvi are best friends and liquor buddies and only have each other, since Gagan's and Pruthvi's mother died (Chakravarthy's wife). They do everything from drinking alcohol to eating roadside foods and beating up wrongdoers in society. Sweety starts getting attracted to Gagan, and they start to hang out, and she gets to know about his family. She comes to Gagan's house and makes a change in their lifestyle for their own sake, for which Chakravarthy happily agrees for. In the meantime, Sweety, learns about Pruthvi's love failure and ends up reconciling with the would-be bride's parents, and the marriage is conducted in a grand manner. Chakravarthy, upon seeing the happiness and joy in the atmosphere at the wedding, realizes that Sweety is the reason behind everything and asks Gagan to always be by her side, and if he is not by her side one day, then Chakravarthy and his family as good as dead.\n\nIn a parallel track, the CM attends the engagement of the daughter of a very rich and ruthless businessman, Aswith Narayana Varma's ([[Jagapathi Babu]]). The would-be groom, however, finds a video of Narayana's daughter romancing and kissing another guy that she liked before the engagement. The groom shows Narayana and tells him about this. The next morning, in breaking news on TV, it is revealed that Narayana has intentionally killed the groom in fear of his pride being destroyed. Narayana says that the thing that he cares about the most in the world in his pride, and he will go to any extent to preserve it. He leaves a gun on the table, and his daughter picks it up and shoots herself.\n\nNarayana and his company plan to build a highway that will make his company the most successful company in all of Asia, but his son Veerendra ([[Shashank (actor)|Shashank]]) reveals that the project has competition in the form of the biggest liquor don in North India, Arjun Pawar ([[Tarun Arora]]). Arjun is supported by his two brothers and has bought off all of Narayana's close associates and subordinates except for his lawyer JP ([[Jayaprakash]]). Arjun threatens JP, stating that if he does not agree to his terms, that his daughter should get married to his youngest brother; otherwise, he will kill her. JP agrees out of fear. Narayana, however, retaliates and sends Veerendra to kill Arjun's brother and breaks up the back and puts him in a critical condition. Now, Arjun then decides to hit back.\n\nSweety realizes that she is truly in love with Gagan and expresses her feelings towards him. Gagan is delighted, and Sweety takes him to her house to her father JP, where he insults him after realizing his lifestyle and the reputation that Chakravarthy has in society, then proceeds to insult Sweety. Enraged, Gagan gives JP a warning, but Sweety, who cares for her father's life more than anything, sends Gagan away and tells him to never come back.\n\nHeartbroken, Gagan drives and tries to forget Sweety but is unable to and gets into a car accident. Fearing for his life, Chakravarthy and his uncle send him away with known relatives in Vizag. Faluguni ([[Pragya Jaiswal]]) arrives at the airport and picks Gagan up, and Gagan realizes that her lifestyle is young, wild, and free. Falguni, however, has no interest in Gagan romantically. While driving back after a party on the beach. Gagan witnesses a family being attacked. He decides to save them, and they turn out to be Narayana's family, and Arjun's brother has been sent to finish them off. Narayana's family pleads Gagan to save them and their daughter-in-law. Gagan fights off some of Pawar's men and saves the daughter-in-law, who happens to be Sweety. Shocked, Gagan is then shot four times and is left for dead. The doctors end up saving him, and then the flashback is revealed by Narayana's wife ([[Sithara (actress)|Sithara]]). \n\nAfter breaking Arjun's brother's back, Narayana then met JP, and they decide to get Veerendra married with Sweety. At the wedding, as Veerendra is about to tie the knot, he is shot and killed, and Arjun's men come and kidnap everyone to kill them. Since Veerendra died at the hands of Arjun, JP has no choice but to let her daughter away from the Narayana family. However, Narayana's sister ([[Vani Viswanath]]) phones her brother and tells him that they need Sweety, since she is almost married to Veerendra, and decided to adopt Sweety as their daughter-in-law. Since her would-be husband is dead, Sweety becomes a poor widow with no family emotions. Gagan then vows to protect Sweety until he dies and will solve all her problems. Narayana's sister comes and says that the family must perform a pooja at the Hamsala Deevi river area. She sees Gagan, who says that he cannot come along. Narayana's sister, in reality, has cut a deal with Arjun to get Sweety and leave her family alone, and Arun agrees. As Narayana and the rest of his family perform the pooja, they attacked by Arjun's men. As they are about to attack Sweety, Gagan emerges from the water along with Chakravarthy and Nandu and kills everyone. He takes Sweety along with him, and Narayana feels that his pride has once again been damaged. Then, the CM enrages both Narayana and Arjun on Gagan, so they both join hands with each other in eliminating Gagan once and for all.\n\nIn the attack, Chakravarthy and Pruthvi are seriously injured, and Narayana kidnaps Sweety. Gagan then lugs his injured brother and father to where Sweety is being kept and kills everyone but Narayana. Finally, Gagan says that Narayana lost his pride a long time ago. As Narayana is listening to this, he shoots himself and dies. Chakravarthy decides to get Gagan married to Sweety and asks what name she would like on the wedding card. Sweety says \"Janaki\", and the film ends on a happy note.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Bellamkonda Sreenivas]] as Gagan Chakravarthy\n*[[Rakul Preet Singh]] as Janaki (Sweety)\n*[[Pragya Jaiswal]] as Falguni (in an extended cameo appearance)\n*[[R.

Each of the torcs has a slightly different design for the left and right terminal.<ref name=bm>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/g/ipswich_hoard_gold_torcs.aspx Gold torcs from the Ipswich Hoard], British Museum, accessed 18 August 2010</ref>\n\n==Today==\nThe 1968 finds are in room 50 of the British Museum, but there are also copies of these torcs in the [[Ipswich Museum]].<ref name=shesh>[http://www.sheshen-eceni.co.uk/icenian_gallery.html The Celtic Coin Gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618053119/http://sheshen-eceni.co.uk/icenian_gallery.html |date=2006-06-18 }}, Sheshen Eceni, accessed 20 August 2010</ref>\n\n==See also ==\n*[[Torc]]\n*[[Snettisham Hoard]]\n*[[Newark Torc]]\n*[[Stirling Hoard]]\n*[[Leekfrith torcs]]\n*[[Sedgeford Torc]]\n*[[List of hoards in Britain]]\n*[[List of Iron Age hoards in Great Britain]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Archaeological sites in Suffolk]]\n[[Category:Treasure troves of the Iron Age]]\n[[Category:Treasure troves in England]]\n[[Category:Torcs]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric objects in the British Museum]]\n[[Category:Archaeology of the kingdom of East Anglia]]\n[[Category:Celtic art]]\n[[Category:1863 archaeological discoveries]]\n[[Category:1968 archaeological discoveries]]\n[[Category:1969 archaeological discoveries]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo: though\u2192through; mnr cpy ed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipswich_Hoard"}

He is best known for his \u2018Hallowed series\u2019 books, of which three of the five-volume part series has been released and published to date. Chung released Arch's Hallow volume 1 in September 2017, followed by the second volume in September 2019 and most recently Volume 3 in February 2020.\n\n==Early life and education==\nChung was born  and raised in Johannesburg. In 2017, he earned a BCom degree in Business Management from [[UNISA]]. He volunteered his time to several philanthropic causes, most notable was his work with the UN Refugee Agency in early 2019 within South Africa and further in Africa. This was to create awareness and provide the necessary help to the many Africans who are displaced yearly from their homes and countries because of poverty, political regimes and military violence.\n\n==Writing career==\nChung writes predominantly fiction and is currently self-publishing and has gone national after signing up with distribution company \u2018Bacchus\u2019. With the author gaining traction in many bookstores countrywide within South Africa, Dane Chung's novels are both available in e-book as well as paperback on Amazon.com. Within a month of going global and simultaneously releasing Volume Two of his supernatural fantasy series, Arch's Hallow has been picked up for further distribution in the US, Australia and the Netherlands.\n\n===Arch's Hallow===\nChung's Hallowed series is a series of five volumes of supernatural fantasy novels that debuted with Volume 1 in 2017. The story revolves around the main character Wyatt Matthews, who survives a brutal and sudden attack, while on his family vacation road trip. With his family dead, Wyatt wakes up in a small and secretive town called Arch's Hallow. As he slowly begins to piece together the truth behind the attack, he also learns that the town itself is not the safe haven it seems to be on the surface. As dark paranormal forces try to penetrate the town, Wyatt discovers that what lies inside the walls of Arch's Hallow is far more dangerous.\n\nThe novel itself had plenty of controversial conversation upon its release with the surprisingly strong sexual content and violently disturbing graphic scenes for a series that was marketed for young adults.\n\n===Letters of Love and War===\nAlong with the staggering success of the release of Volume 2 of Arch's Hallow in 2019, the author also released a historical war romance novel called ''Letters of Love & War'' which received plenty of praise from his fans and critics alike. The novel will be re-released in 2020 along with two other stand-alone novels in the works.\n\n===The Verse===\nThe author has publicly released a list of 28 novels set for release in the coming years, all of which are part of ''The Verse''.\n\n{{quote|\u201cThe Verse has been something I have been working on for a couple of years now and I am truly excited to be sharing it with my fans. I have written and am still writing various novels over a vast array of genres that are all connected in this universe, yet each novel can be read as a standalone or as part of its series or Trilogy.
