The trademark name '''INDYCAR''' was officially adopted on January 1, 2011. The sport of [[American open-wheel car racing|open-wheel car racing]] itself, also historically referred to as Championship Car racing or Indy racing, traces its roots to as early as 1905. It is the fourth major sanctioning body to govern the sport of Indy car racing, following [[AAA Contest Board|AAA]], [[United States Auto Club|USAC]], and [[Champ Car]].\n\nToday, IndyCar is owned by [[Roger Penske]] via Penske Entertainment Corp a subsidiary of [[Penske Corporation]]. Penske purchased IndyCar and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway from  Hulman & Co. in November 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/IMS|title=Indianapolis Motor Speedway (@IMS) {{!}} Twitter|website=twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-04}}</ref>\n\n==Indycar==\n\n===IndyCar Series===\n{{Main|IndyCar Series}}\nThe League's premier series debuted in 1996 under the name Indy Racing League. The series adopted the name Indy Racing League IndyCar Series in 2003. With [[Verizon]] as corporate sponsor from 2014 through 2018, the series has been known as the Verizon IndyCar Series. On January 15, 2019, it was announced that NTT Corporation ([[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone]]) would become the title sponsor and the series will become the NTT IndyCar Series.\n\nThe series initially raced exclusively on [[Oval track racing|oval tracks]], as the series was founded partly in response to the increasing prominence of [[road racing|road]] and [[street circuit|street courses]] on the [[Champ Car|CART]] schedule. In 2005, the series abandoned its unofficial ovals-only stance, and added three road\u2013street course events.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/31942227/tampa_bay_times/|title=St. Petersburg is site for IRL changes|newspaper=Tampa Bay Times|date=January 22, 2005|page=33|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> By 2009, the series had a roughly 50/50 split of ovals and road/street courses. Presently, the series  currently runs one-third of its schedule on ovals and the rest on road and street circuits.\n\n===Indy Lights===\n{{Main|Indy Lights}}\nIndy Lights is the development series for the IndyCar series.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/31942316/the_missoulian/|title=IndyCar turns over rights to Indy Lights|newspaper=The Missoulian|date=July 13, 2013|page=37|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> The Indy Lights concept traces its roots back the USAC Mini Indy Series of the late 1970, and the CART ARS/Indy Lights series that began in 1986. The current Indy Lights series debuted in 2002 under the name Infiniti Pro Series. After the 2008 open wheel unification, the Indy Lights name returned. The Indy Lights typically run as support races to IndyCar Series races, but occasionally has run stand-alone races, or as a support race of other events. The series is now promoted by Andersen Promotions.\n\n===Indy Pro 2000===\n{{Main|Indy Pro 2000 Championship}}\nThe Indy Pro 2000 Championship presented is an open-wheel racecar driver development series in North America. Competitors use spec cars built by [[Tatuus]]. The original series, using first-generation tube-frame cars started in the early 1990s. The second-gen, high-tech, carbon-fiber car was released in 2004. From 2017, the series has used spec Tatuus PM-18s. The series has historically included road courses, street courses, and ovals. The series' primary sponsors is [[Cooper Tire]] and the cars, while purpose built for the track with carbon fiber monocoques, are powered by 275 horsepower Mazda-prepared 2 liter MZR-PM18A engines. The series' stated goal is \"to develop new race driving talent.\" In 2010, the series became a part of The Road to Indy. In 2013 the series' promotion was taken over by Andersen Promotions. In 2019, following the departure of Mazda as an official sponsor, the series was rebranded as Indy Pro 2000 from its previous Pro Mazda name.\n\n===U.S. F2000===\n{{Main|U.S. F2000 National Championship}}\nUSF2000 is a series the organisation started sanctioning in 2010. Originally started in 1991 and\nfolded in 2006, it was restarted in 2010 as part of the \"[[Road to Indy]]\" ladder series promoted by Andersen Promotions. The series utilizes tube frame [[Formula Ford]] chassis fitted with larger [[Mazda]] MZR four cylinder engines and wings and slicks and was originally based on the [[Formula Continental]] rules formula.\n\n==History==\n\n===IndyCar name=== \nThe term \"Indy Car\" began as a nickname for the cars that competed in [[United States Automobile Club|USAC]]'s \"Championship\" division of [[American open-wheel car racing|open-wheel auto racing]] in the United States, deriving from the sport's most popular competition, the [[Indianapolis 500]].   The division's link with Indianapolis soon resulted in the term supplanting the official descriptor, \"champ car,\" in common use and promotions.\n\nThe term continued to be used by USAC's replacement as the dominant governing body for open-wheel racing, [[Champ Car|Championship Auto Racing Teams]], which called its main series the \"CART PPG Indy Car World Series\" despite the body not sanctioning the 500.  In [[1992 in sports|1992]], during an attempt by CART to broaden their board membership, the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] registered the [[camel case]] trademark ''IndyCar'' with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] and licensed it to CART as their new tradename.\n\nIn 1996, Indianapolis Motor Speedway President [[Tony George]] launched a new national championship racing series, the USAC sanctioned [[Indy Racing League]].  This resulted in a legal battle over the ''IndyCar'' trademark: In  March 1996, CART filed a [[lawsuit]] against the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in an effort to protect their license to the ''IndyCar'' mark after the Indianapolis Motor Speedway had attempted to terminate it.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Indy Car wars : the 30-year fight for control of American open-whell racing|last=1948-|first=Whitaker, Sigur E.|publisher=|isbn=9781476619804|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|pages=76|oclc=926914971|date = 2015-10-27}}</ref> In April, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway filed a separate lawsuit against CART to prevent them from further use of the mark.\n\nEventually a settlement was reached in which CART agreed to give up the use of the ''IndyCar'' mark following the 1996 season and the IRL agreeing not to use the name before the end of the 2002 season.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Indy Car wars : the 30-year fight for control of American open-whell racing|last=1948-|first=Whitaker, Sigur E.|publisher=|isbn=9781476619804|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|pages=81|oclc=926914971|date = 2015-10-27}}</ref> CART returned to branding as simply CART for 1997, and resurrected the term \"champ car\" to describe their vehicles.\n\nFollowing a six-year hiatus, the Indy Racing League announced it would rename their premier series the IndyCar Series for the 2003 racing season; CART followed suit by renaming their main series the Champ Car World Series.\n\nPost-unification, a heavy emphasis has been placed on deemphasizing the legal entity name and its initials and replacing it with the IndyCar name. This became official on January 1, 2011, as Indy Racing League LLC adopted as its [[trade name]] INDYCAR. On November 1, 2013, the company's legal name was changed to INDYCAR LLC.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bsd.sos.in.gov/PublicBusinessSearch/GetBOSFilingDocuments?FilingNo=2542080&BusinessID=373780|title=INBiz: Your one-stop source for your business.|website=bsd.sos.in.gov|access-date=2019-05-19}}</ref>\n\n===Split with CART===\n\nThe dispute between CART and the IRL centered on the Indianapolis 500, long considered the flagship race of the sport.  From 1980 until 1995, the Indy 500 continued to be sanctioned by USAC while being run predominantly with drivers from CART and counting toward CART's standings. George felt that his opinions on the direction of the sport,  while CART owners felt George used his influence over USAC to have a disproportionate impact on the general operation of the sport.\n\nAfter a number of attempts at a compromise board failed, IMS formed the Indy Racing League in [[1994 in sports|1994]], with the series being slated to begin racing in [[1996 in IRL|1996]]. [[Champ Car|CART]] had primarily sanctioned Indy car racing since [[1979 in sports|1979]], when the organization broke away from [[United States Auto Club|USAC]]. George blueprinted the IRL as a lower-cost open-wheel alternative to CART, which he viewed had become technology-driven and dominated by a few wealthy multi-car teams. The IRL was designed only to run on oval tracks to promote American drivers from the midget and sprint car ranks to graduate to Indycars the way that of Indy racing A.J. Foyt, Mario Andretti, Johnny Rutherford, and the Unsers had in the 1960s.\n\nStarting with the first IRL season, the league proclaimed that 25 of the 33 spots in the Indy 500 starting grid for cars from full-time IRL teams.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Indy Car wars : the 30-year fight for control of American open-whell racing|last=1948-|first=Whitaker, Sigur E.|publisher=|isbn=9781476619804|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|pages=70|oclc=926914971|date = 2015-10-27}}</ref> In 1996, CART retaliated by scheduling what was supposed to become its new showcase event, the [[U.S. 500]], at [[Michigan International Speedway]] on Memorial Day, the traditional date for the Indy 500. The inaugural U.S. 500 was an unmitigated disaster when there was a massive crash coming to the green flag. Although CART continued to run the race until 1999, it never drew fan interest like the Indy 500. Although modified in 1999, the initial Indy 500 policy toward CART had already become less significant when the IRL came out with their own chassis specifications in 1997 and CART spec chassis were no longer legal.\n\nThe new 1997 technical rules featured less expensive chassis and \"production-based\" engines that were purchased rather than leased, but most importantly, were technically incompatible with CART specifications. The IRL's early seasons consisted of sparse schedules and inexperienced teams, with the degradation in quality especially apparent during the Indianapolis 500, which saw a dramatic decline in prestige.\n\nThe IRL began to draw top teams from CART starting in 2002, contributing to the latter's [[bankruptcy]], re-branding as [[Champ Car]] in 2003,<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Indy Car wars : the 30-year fight for control of American open-whell racing|last=1948-|first=Whitaker, Sigur E.|publisher=|isbn=9781476619804|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|pages=107|oclc=926914971|date = 2015-10-27}}</ref> and ultimate demise and absorption by the IRL in 2008.\n\nAfter absorbing Champ Car, the IndyCar Series became similar in many ways to the CART series from which it separated and its related European open-wheel [[Formula racing|formula]] counterparts: former prominent CART teams such as [[Chip Ganassi Racing]] and [[Team Penske]] are frequent race winners, there is a strong contingent of foreign-born drivers, the cars are increasingly electronic and aero dependent and the schedule includes more road and street courses than oval tracks.\n\n===Unification with Champ Car===\nOn January 23, 2008, [[Tony George]] offered [[Champ Car]] management a proposal that included free cars and engine leases to Champ Car teams willing to run the entire 2008 IndyCar Series schedule in exchange for adding Champ Car's dates at [[Grand Prix of Long Beach|Long Beach]], [[Honda Indy Toronto|Toronto]], [[Edmonton Indy|Edmonton]], and [[Gold Coast Indy 300|Australia]] to the IndyCar Series schedule, effectively reuniting [[American open-wheel car racing]].<ref name=\"Unity\">{{cite news\n |url=http://www.speedtv.com/articles/auto/champcar/42686/\n |title=Tony George Makes an Offer for Unity \n |publisher=SpeedTV.com \n |date=2008-01-23 \n |accessdate=2008-01-23 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080127104701/http://www.speedtv.com/articles/auto/champcar/42686/ \n |archivedate=2008-01-27 \n}}</ref> The offer was initially made in November 2007.<ref name=\"Unity\"/> On February 10, 2008, Tony George, along with IRL representatives Terry Angstadt and [[Brian Barnhart]], plus former [[Honda]] executive Robert Clarke, traveled to [[Japan]] to discuss moving the [[Indy Japan 300]] at [[Twin Ring Motegi]].<ref name=\"George off to Japan\">{{cite news\n |url=http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080209/SPORTS0107/802090474/1052/SPORTS01 \n |title=George off to Japan in pursuit of unification \n |publisher=IndyStar.com \n |date=2008-02-09 \n |accessdate=2008-02-13 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218205058/http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080209%2FSPORTS0107%2F802090474%2F1052%2FSPORTS01 \n |archivedate=2008-02-18 \n |url-status=dead \n}}</ref> Moving that race, or postponing it, would be required in order to accommodate the [[Long Beach Grand Prix]], which was scheduled for the same weekend.<ref name=\"George off to Japan\"/> Optimism following the meeting was high.<ref name=\"Official optimistic\">{{cite news|url=http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080212/SPORTS0107/302120004/1052/SPORTS01 |title=Official optimistic IRL-Champ Car merger talks will continue |publisher=IndyStar.com |date=2008-02-12 |accessdate=2008-02-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106122451/http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080212%2FSPORTS0107%2F302120004%2F1052%2FSPORTS01 |archivedate=November 6, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn February 2008, Indy Racing League founder and CEO Tony George and owners of the Champ Car World Series completed an agreement to unify the sport for 2008.<ref>{{cite news |title =Done Deal |publisher =IndyCar.com |url =http://www.indycar.com/news/story.php?story_id=10557 |accessdate =2010-08-22 |url-status =dead |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080313085154/http://www.indycar.com/news/story.php?story_id=10557 |archivedate =2008-03-13 }}</ref> The result was that the Champ Car World Series was suspended except for the [[Long Beach Grand Prix]].

The new [[Dallara DW12]] racecar was introduced for the 2012 season. IndyCar collaborated with [[DreamWorks Animation]] to launch comedy film [[Turbo (film)|Turbo]] in 2013. Bernard was fired in October 2012, and replaced by Mark Miles.\n\n===Driver safety===\nDriver safety has also been a major point of concern, with a number of drivers seriously injured, particularly in the early years of the series.  There have been five fatal crashes in the history of the series. Compared to [[road racing]] venues, the lack of run-offs on oval tracks, coupled with higher speeds due to the long straights and banked turns, means that there is far less margin for error. Car design was attributed as a leading cause of early injuries, and the series made improvements to chassis design to address those safety concerns. Following a series of spectacular high-profile accidents in [[2003 in sports|2003]], including American racing legend [[Mario Andretti]] and former champion [[Kenny Br\u00e4ck]], as well as the death of [[Tony Renna]] in testing at Indianapolis, the IRL made additional changes to reduce speeds and increase safety.\n\nIndyCar was the first racing series to adopt the [[SAFER barrier|SAFER]] soft wall safety system, which debuted at the Indianapolis 500 and has now been installed at almost all major oval racing circuits. The SAFER system research and design was supported and funded in large part by the Hulman-George family and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n==Fatalities==\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Scott Brayton]]&nbsp;\u2013 (May 17, 1996), [[1996 Indianapolis 500]] practice session.\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Tony Renna]]&nbsp;\u2013 (October 22, 2003), Firestone private testing session.\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Paul Dana]]&nbsp;\u2013 (March 26, 2006), [[2006 Toyota Indy 300]] practice session.\n*{{flagicon|UK}} [[Dan Wheldon]]&nbsp;\u2013 (October 16, 2011), [[2011 IZOD IndyCar World Championship]].\n*{{flagicon|UK}} [[Justin Wilson (racing driver)|Justin Wilson]]&nbsp;\u2013 (August 24, 2015), [[2015 ABC Supply 500]].<ref>{{Cite web|url =https://twitter.com/AP/status/635980394886787073|title =AP|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20151107004007/https://twitter.com/AP/status/635980394886787073|archive-date =2015-11-07|url-status =live}}</ref>\n*(Extended list here: [[List of IndyCar fatalities]])\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\">\nFile:HondaIndyV8.jpg|The [[Honda]] engine that Indycar would use from [[2006 IndyCar Series season|2006]] until [[2011 IndyCar Series season|2011]].\nFile:Simon pagenaud (47966335213).jpg|[[Simon Pagenaud]] during [[2019 Indianapolis 500]].\nFile:9 Aaron Telitz 2018 Road America Grand Prix.jpg|[[Aaron Telitz]] at [[Road America]] during the [[2018 Indy Lights]] season.\nFile:Heamin Choi USF2000.jpg|[[U.S. F2000 National Championship|U.S. F2000]] driver [[Heamin Choi]] at [[Lucas Oil Raceway]] in 2012.\n</gallery>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]]\n* [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network]]\n* [[American Automobile Association]]\n* [[United States Auto Club]]\n* [[Champ Car]]\n* [[List of IndyCar Series teams]]\n* [[List of IndyCar Series racetracks]]\n* [[List of American Championship Car Rookie of the Year Winners]]\n* [[List of American Championship car racing point scoring systems]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|http://indycar.com}}\n*{{Curlie|Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing/Organizations/Indy_Racing_League}}\n\n{{Indy Racing League Seasons}}\n{{American Championship Car seasons}}\n{{Indy Racing League}}\n{{Sirius XM Channels}}\n{{Class of Auto racing}}\n{{Indy Racing League games}}\n\n[[Category:IndyCar Series|*]]\n[[Category:Sports organizations established in 1911]]\n[[Category:Open wheel racing]]\n[[Category:Penske]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the sanctioning body|the top level of American open wheel car racing|IndyCar Series|an overview of Indy car racing|American open-wheel car racing}}\n{{short description|Auto racing sanctioning body for North American open wheel racing}}\n{{Infobox sport governing body\n|name          = INDYCAR, LLC\n|logo          = INDYCAR logo.png\n|sport         = Auto Racing\n|founded       = 1994<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/bruce_martin/12/15/dan.wheldon.investigation.indycar/IndyCar_investigation.pdf |title=2011 Las Vegas Accident Information |access-date=2012-07-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225113250/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/bruce_martin/12/15/dan.wheldon.investigation.indycar/IndyCar_investigation.pdf |archive-date=2013-02-25 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|aff           = [[Automobile Competition Committee for the United States|ACCUS-FIA]]\n|affdate       = 1996\n|region        =\n|regionyear    =\n| image        =\n| caption      =\n| category     = [[Open-wheel cars]]\n| jurisdiction = {{USA}}<br>{{CAN}}\n| year closed  =\n| headquarters = [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana|IN]]\n| president    = [[Jay Frye]]\n| chairman     = \n| key staff    = \n|chiefexec     =\n|replaced      =\n|prevfounded   =\n|url           = indycar.com\n}}\n'''INDYCAR, LLC''', is an American-based [[auto racing]] [[Governing body|sanctioning body]] for [[American open-wheel car racing|Indy car racing]] and other disciplines of [[Open-wheel car|open wheel car]] racing.

In 2005, the series abandoned its unofficial ovals-only stance, and added three road\u2013street course events.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/31942227/tampa_bay_times/|title=St. Petersburg is site for IRL changes|newspaper=Tampa Bay Times|date=January 22, 2005|page=33|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> By 2009, the series had a roughly 50/50 split of ovals and road/street courses. Presently, the series  currently runs one-third of its schedule on ovals and the rest on road and street circuits.\n\n===Indy Lights===\n{{Main|Indy Lights}}\nIndy Lights is the development series for the IndyCar series.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/31942316/the_missoulian/|title=IndyCar turns over rights to Indy Lights|newspaper=The Missoulian|date=July 13, 2013|page=37|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> The Indy Lights concept traces its roots back the USAC Mini Indy Series of the late 1970, and the CART ARS/Indy Lights series that began in 1986. The current Indy Lights series debuted in 2002 under the name Infiniti Pro Series. After the 2008 open wheel unification, the Indy Lights name returned. The Indy Lights typically run as support races to IndyCar Series races, but occasionally has run stand-alone races, or as a support race of other events. The series is now promoted by Andersen Promotions.\n\n===Indy Pro 2000===\n{{Main|Indy Pro 2000 Championship}}\nThe Indy Pro 2000 Championship presented is an open-wheel racecar driver development series in North America. Competitors use spec cars built by [[Tatuus]]. The original series, using first-generation tube-frame cars started in the early 1990s. The second-gen, high-tech, carbon-fiber car was released in 2004. From 2017, the series has used spec Tatuus PM-18s. The series has historically included road courses, street courses, and ovals. The series' primary sponsors is [[Cooper Tire]] and the cars, while purpose built for the track with carbon fiber monocoques, are powered by 275 horsepower Mazda-prepared 2 liter MZR-PM18A engines. The series' stated goal is \"to develop new race driving talent.\" In 2010, the series became a part of The Road to Indy. In 2013 the series' promotion was taken over by Andersen Promotions. In 2019, following the departure of Mazda as an official sponsor, the series was rebranded as Indy Pro 2000 from its previous Pro Mazda name.\n\n===U.S. F2000===\n{{Main|U.S. F2000 National Championship}}\nUSF2000 is a series the organisation started sanctioning in 2010. Originally started in 1991 and\nfolded in 2006, it was restarted in 2010 as part of the \"[[Road to Indy]]\" ladder series promoted by Andersen Promotions. The series utilizes tube frame [[Formula Ford]] chassis fitted with larger [[Mazda]] MZR four cylinder engines and wings and slicks and was originally based on the [[Formula Continental]] rules formula.\n\n==History==\n\n===IndyCar name=== \nThe term \"Indy Car\" began as a nickname for the cars that competed in [[United States Automobile Club|USAC]]'s \"Championship\" division of [[American open-wheel car racing|open-wheel auto racing]] in the United States, deriving from the sport's most popular competition, the [[Indianapolis 500]].   The division's link with Indianapolis soon resulted in the term supplanting the official descriptor, \"champ car,\" in common use and promotions.\n\nThe term continued to be used by USAC's replacement as the dominant governing body for open-wheel racing, [[Champ Car|Championship Auto Racing Teams]], which called its main series the \"CART PPG Indy Car World Series\" despite the body not sanctioning the 500.  In [[1992 in sports|1992]], during an attempt by CART to broaden their board membership, the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] registered the [[camel case]] trademark ''IndyCar'' with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] and licensed it to CART as their new tradename.\n\nIn 1996, Indianapolis Motor Speedway President [[Tony George]] launched a new national championship racing series, the USAC sanctioned [[Indy Racing League]].  This resulted in a legal battle over the ''IndyCar'' trademark: In  March 1996, CART filed a [[lawsuit]] against the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in an effort to protect their license to the ''IndyCar'' mark after the Indianapolis Motor Speedway had attempted to terminate it.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Indy Car wars : the 30-year fight for control of American open-whell racing|last=1948-|first=Whitaker, Sigur E.|publisher=|isbn=9781476619804|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|pages=76|oclc=926914971|date = 2015-10-27}}</ref> In April, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway filed a separate lawsuit against CART to prevent them from further use of the mark.\n\nEventually a settlement was reached in which CART agreed to give up the use of the ''IndyCar'' mark following the 1996 season and the IRL agreeing not to use the name before the end of the 2002 season.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Indy Car wars : the 30-year fight for control of American open-whell racing|last=1948-|first=Whitaker, Sigur E.|publisher=|isbn=9781476619804|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|pages=81|oclc=926914971|date = 2015-10-27}}</ref> CART returned to branding as simply CART for 1997, and resurrected the term \"champ car\" to describe their vehicles.\n\nFollowing a six-year hiatus, the Indy Racing League announced it would rename their premier series the IndyCar Series for the 2003 racing season; CART followed suit by renaming their main series the Champ Car World Series.\n\nPost-unification, a heavy emphasis has been placed on deemphasizing the legal entity name and its initials and replacing it with the IndyCar name. This became official on January 1, 2011, as Indy Racing League LLC adopted as its [[trade name]] INDYCAR. On November 1, 2013, the company's legal name was changed to INDYCAR LLC.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bsd.sos.in.gov/PublicBusinessSearch/GetBOSFilingDocuments?FilingNo=2542080&BusinessID=373780|title=INBiz: Your one-stop source for your business.|website=bsd.sos.in.gov|access-date=2019-05-19}}</ref>\n\n===Split with CART===\n\nThe dispute between CART and the IRL centered on the Indianapolis 500, long considered the flagship race of the sport.  From 1980 until 1995, the Indy 500 continued to be sanctioned by USAC while being run predominantly with drivers from CART and counting toward CART's standings. George felt that his opinions on the direction of the sport,  while CART owners felt George used his influence over USAC to have a disproportionate impact on the general operation of the sport.\n\nAfter a number of attempts at a compromise board failed, IMS formed the Indy Racing League in [[1994 in sports|1994]], with the series being slated to begin racing in [[1996 in IRL|1996]]. [[Champ Car|CART]] had primarily sanctioned Indy car racing since [[1979 in sports|1979]], when the organization broke away from [[United States Auto Club|USAC]]. George blueprinted the IRL as a lower-cost open-wheel alternative to CART, which he viewed had become technology-driven and dominated by a few wealthy multi-car teams. The IRL was designed only to run on oval tracks to promote American drivers from the midget and sprint car ranks to graduate to Indycars the way that of Indy racing A.J. Foyt, Mario Andretti, Johnny Rutherford, and the Unsers had in the 1960s.\n\nStarting with the first IRL season, the league proclaimed that 25 of the 33 spots in the Indy 500 starting grid for cars from full-time IRL teams.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Indy Car wars : the 30-year fight for control of American open-whell racing|last=1948-|first=Whitaker, Sigur E.|publisher=|isbn=9781476619804|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|pages=70|oclc=926914971|date = 2015-10-27}}</ref> In 1996, CART retaliated by scheduling what was supposed to become its new showcase event, the [[U.S. 500]], at [[Michigan International Speedway]] on Memorial Day, the traditional date for the Indy 500. The inaugural U.S. 500 was an unmitigated disaster when there was a massive crash coming to the green flag. Although CART continued to run the race until 1999, it never drew fan interest like the Indy 500. Although modified in 1999, the initial Indy 500 policy toward CART had already become less significant when the IRL came out with their own chassis specifications in 1997 and CART spec chassis were no longer legal.\n\nThe new 1997 technical rules featured less expensive chassis and \"production-based\" engines that were purchased rather than leased, but most importantly, were technically incompatible with CART specifications. The IRL's early seasons consisted of sparse schedules and inexperienced teams, with the degradation in quality especially apparent during the Indianapolis 500, which saw a dramatic decline in prestige.\n\nThe IRL began to draw top teams from CART starting in 2002, contributing to the latter's [[bankruptcy]], re-branding as [[Champ Car]] in 2003,<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Indy Car wars : the 30-year fight for control of American open-whell racing|last=1948-|first=Whitaker, Sigur E.|publisher=|isbn=9781476619804|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|pages=107|oclc=926914971|date = 2015-10-27}}</ref> and ultimate demise and absorption by the IRL in 2008.\n\nAfter absorbing Champ Car, the IndyCar Series became similar in many ways to the CART series from which it separated and its related European open-wheel [[Formula racing|formula]] counterparts: former prominent CART teams such as [[Chip Ganassi Racing]] and [[Team Penske]] are frequent race winners, there is a strong contingent of foreign-born drivers, the cars are increasingly electronic and aero dependent and the schedule includes more road and street courses than oval tracks.\n\n===Unification with Champ Car===\nOn January 23, 2008, [[Tony George]] offered [[Champ Car]] management a proposal that included free cars and engine leases to Champ Car teams willing to run the entire 2008 IndyCar Series schedule in exchange for adding Champ Car's dates at [[Grand Prix of Long Beach|Long Beach]], [[Honda Indy Toronto|Toronto]], [[Edmonton Indy|Edmonton]], and [[Gold Coast Indy 300|Australia]] to the IndyCar Series schedule, effectively reuniting [[American open-wheel car racing]].<ref name=\"Unity\">{{cite news\n |url=http://www.speedtv.com/articles/auto/champcar/42686/\n |title=Tony George Makes an Offer for Unity \n |publisher=SpeedTV.com \n |date=2008-01-23 \n |accessdate=2008-01-23 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080127104701/http://www.speedtv.com/articles/auto/champcar/42686/ \n |archivedate=2008-01-27 \n}}</ref> The offer was initially made in November 2007.<ref name=\"Unity\"/> On February 10, 2008, Tony George, along with IRL representatives Terry Angstadt and [[Brian Barnhart]], plus former [[Honda]] executive Robert Clarke, traveled to [[Japan]] to discuss moving the [[Indy Japan 300]] at [[Twin Ring Motegi]].<ref name=\"George off to Japan\">{{cite news\n |url=http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080209/SPORTS0107/802090474/1052/SPORTS01 \n |title=George off to Japan in pursuit of unification \n |publisher=IndyStar.com \n |date=2008-02-09 \n |accessdate=2008-02-13 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218205058/http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080209%2FSPORTS0107%2F802090474%2F1052%2FSPORTS01 \n |archivedate=2008-02-18 \n |url-status=dead \n}}</ref> Moving that race, or postponing it, would be required in order to accommodate the [[Long Beach Grand Prix]], which was scheduled for the same weekend.<ref name=\"George off to Japan\"/> Optimism following the meeting was high.<ref name=\"Official optimistic\">{{cite news|url=http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080212/SPORTS0107/302120004/1052/SPORTS01 |title=Official optimistic IRL-Champ Car merger talks will continue |publisher=IndyStar.com |date=2008-02-12 |accessdate=2008-02-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106122451/http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080212%2FSPORTS0107%2F302120004%2F1052%2FSPORTS01 |archivedate=November 6, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn February 2008, Indy Racing League founder and CEO Tony George and owners of the Champ Car World Series completed an agreement to unify the sport for 2008.<ref>{{cite news |title =Done Deal |publisher =IndyCar.com |url =http://www.indycar.com/news/story.php?story_id=10557 |accessdate =2010-08-22 |url-status =dead |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080313085154/http://www.indycar.com/news/story.php?story_id=10557 |archivedate =2008-03-13 }}</ref> The result was that the Champ Car World Series was suspended except for the [[Long Beach Grand Prix]].

The new [[Dallara DW12]] racecar was introduced for the 2012 season. IndyCar collaborated with [[DreamWorks Animation]] to launch comedy film [[Turbo (film)|Turbo]] in 2013. Bernard was fired in October 2012, and replaced by Mark Miles.\n\n===Driver safety===\nDriver safety has also been a major point of concern, with a number of drivers seriously injured, particularly in the early years of the series.  There have been five fatal crashes in the history of the series. Compared to [[road racing]] venues, the lack of run-offs on oval tracks, coupled with higher speeds due to the long straights and banked turns, means that there is far less margin for error. Car design was attributed as a leading cause of early injuries, and the series made improvements to chassis design to address those safety concerns. Following a series of spectacular high-profile accidents in [[2003 in sports|2003]], including American racing legend [[Mario Andretti]] and former champion [[Kenny Br\u00e4ck]], as well as the death of [[Tony Renna]] in testing at Indianapolis, the IRL made additional changes to reduce speeds and increase safety.\n\nIndyCar was the first racing series to adopt the [[SAFER barrier|SAFER]] soft wall safety system, which debuted at the Indianapolis 500 and has now been installed at almost all major oval racing circuits. The SAFER system research and design was supported and funded in large part by the Hulman-George family and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n==Fatalities==\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Scott Brayton]]&nbsp;\u2013 (May 17, 1996), [[1996 Indianapolis 500]] practice session.\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Tony Renna]]&nbsp;\u2013 (October 22, 2003), Firestone private testing session.\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Paul Dana]]&nbsp;\u2013 (March 26, 2006), [[2006 Toyota Indy 300]] practice session.\n*{{flagicon|UK}} [[Dan Wheldon]]&nbsp;\u2013 (October 16, 2011), [[2011 IZOD IndyCar World Championship]].\n*{{flagicon|UK}} [[Justin Wilson (racing driver)|Justin Wilson]]&nbsp;\u2013 (August 24, 2015), [[2015 ABC Supply 500]].<ref>{{Cite web|url =https://twitter.com/AP/status/635980394886787073|title =AP|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20151107004007/https://twitter.com/AP/status/635980394886787073|archive-date =2015-11-07|url-status =live}}</ref>\n*(Extended list here: [[List of IndyCar fatalities]])\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\">\nFile:HondaIndyV8.jpg|The [[Honda]] engine that Indycar would use from [[2006 IndyCar Series season|2006]] until [[2011 IndyCar Series season|2011]].\nFile:Simon pagenaud (47966335213).jpg|[[Simon Pagenaud]] during [[2019 Indianapolis 500]].\nFile:9 Aaron Telitz 2018 Road America Grand Prix.jpg|[[Aaron Telitz]] at [[Road America]] during the [[2018 Indy Lights]] season.\nFile:Heamin Choi USF2000.jpg|[[U.S. F2000 National Championship|U.S. F2000]] driver [[Heamin Choi]] at [[Lucas Oil Raceway]] in 2012.\n</gallery>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]]\n* [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network]]\n* [[American Automobile Association]]\n* [[United States Auto Club]]\n* [[Champ Car]]\n* [[List of IndyCar Series teams]]\n* [[List of IndyCar Series racetracks]]\n* [[List of American Championship Car Rookie of the Year Winners]]\n* [[List of American Championship car racing point scoring systems]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|http://indycar.com}}\n*{{Curlie|Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing/Organizations/Indy_Racing_League}}\n\n{{Indy Racing League Seasons}}\n{{American Championship Car seasons}}\n{{Indy Racing League}}\n{{Sirius XM Channels}}\n{{Class of Auto racing}}\n{{Indy Racing League games}}\n\n[[Category:IndyCar Series|*]]\n[[Category:Sports organizations established in 1911]]\n[[Category:Open wheel racing]]\n[[Category:Penske]]\n", "name_user": "Rogerd", "label": "safe", "comment": "remove the word \"the\"", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndyCar"}

It was first published in 1973 as part of Walker's short story collection ''In Love and Trouble''.\n\nThe short story is told in  [[first-person narrative|first person]] by \"Mama\", an African-American woman living in the [[Deep South]] with one of her two daughters. The story follows the differences between Mrs. Johnson and her shy younger daughter Maggie, who both still adhere to traditional black culture in the rural South, and her educated, successful daughter Dee, or \"Wangero\" as she prefers to be called, who takes a different route to reclaiming her cultural identity.\n\nA film version was released in 2005.\n\n==<span lang=\"fa\" dir=\"rtl\">Plot</span>==\nThe story opens on Mama waiting in the yard for her oldest daughter, Dee\u2019s, visit.  She reflects on the differences between Dee and Maggie, her youngest daughter, and knows that Maggie will be anxious and self-conscious around Dee. Maggie was burned in a house fire that happened more than a decade ago. Mama carried her out in her arms, as Dee watched the house burn. Dee was seemingly happy and excited about the fire, due to her extreme dislike for the house. The narrator continues to paint a picture of Maggie as helpless and rather awkward, whereas Dee is beautiful and seems to have had an easier time in life.\n\nDee left home to pursue an education in Augusta, afforded to her by Mama and the community\u2019s fund raising efforts. Mama never attended school past second grade, and Maggie has a very limited reading ability, so Dee\u2019s education is a stark difference and Mama seems to feel that starkness, commenting, \u201clike dimwits, we seemed about to understand\u201d. <ref name=\":1\" />  Mama discusses the physical differences between the three: her own manly looks, Maggie\u2019s timid disposition, and Dee\u2019s own nice hair, full figure, and stylish way of dress.\n\nWhen Dee finally arrives, she is accompanied by a man, whom Mama refers to as Hakim-a-barber. Mama and Maggie are a little taken aback by Dee's wild-looking outfit and her African greeting to them. Dee takes photos of Mama and Maggie in front of the house, and the greetings are stiff and unfamiliar. Dee informs her mother that she has now changed her name to Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo in order to protest the oppression and cultural white washing Black Americans faced. Mama rejects this, telling Dee she was named after her Aunt Dicie, who in turn was named after Grandma Dee, and that the name went on through the generations. Dee gives Mama the option of not using her new name, and Mama concludes that Hakim-a-barber must be related to a family of Muslims down the road. Hakim-a-barber says he accepts some of the doctrines of his beef-raising family, but is not interested in farming or herding as a profession.\n\nMama does not know whether Hakim-a-barber and Dee are married, nor does she ask. Hakim-a-barber has a restricted diet to follow, but Dee digs into the food Mama made. She begins asking for things around the house, like the top of a butter churn, and eventually she asks for two quilts as well.  This quilt in particular is one that Mama had promised to Maggie, and Dee\u2019s persistence frustrates Mama which develops into an argument between Mama and Dee. Dee argues that by using the quilt as a normal item, in \u201ceveryday use\u201d, the quilt will be ruined, and the cultural importance will be lost. Mama would rather the item be used practically by her family and be ruined than have it sit on a shelf or be hung on a wall as a piece of art, and as Dee readies to leave, she tells Mama that Mama doesn\u2019t understand her own heritage.  She adds that Mama should try and improve, and that there is a new path for Black Americans to follow. Maggie and Mama sit in the yard after watching them drive off, until bedtime.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Dee''' \u2013 She is an educated African-American woman and the eldest daughter of Mama. She seeks to embrace her cultural identity through changing her name from Dee to Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo (an African name), marrying a Muslim man, and acquiring artifacts from Mama's house to put on display, an approach that puts her at odds with Mama and Maggie.  She is physically beautiful and is described as having a great sense of style.\n* '''Mama''' \u2013 She is described as a \"large, big-boned woman with rough, man-working hands.\"<ref name=\":1\" />  She enjoys her lifestyle (especially milking cows) and did not receive an education past second grade.\n* '''Maggie''' \u2013 Described by Mama as dull and unattractive, the youngest daughter Maggie has burn scars and marks from the burning down of their prior home, and is very nervous and self-conscious because of it. She leads a simple and traditional life with her mother in the South while her elder sister, Dee, is away at school.  She has very limited reading ability, unlike her sister Dee.\n* '''Hakim-a-barber''' \u2013 Dee\u2019s partner, he is referred to as \"Asalamalakim\", which is a Muslim greeting, throughout the story because he is Muslim.  Eventually he tells Mama to call him \"Hakim-a-barber\" due to Mama being unable to pronounce his real name.\n\n\n== Themes ==\nOne of the primary themes that the story revolves around is the idea of a person's relationship with their heritage.<ref name=\":2\">{{Citation|last=Walker, Alice, 1944-|title=Everyday use|date=2004|publisher=Recording for the Blind & Dyslexic|oclc=55770645}}</ref> In the story, Dee's mother remained close to immediate family traditions, while Dee herself chose to search more deeply into her African roots. Dee has a different mindset; she does not have the same ideals as Mama and Maggie, particularly in regard to cultural preservation and the best way to go about it. Dee (Wangero) only wants the family heirlooms to display in her home for their \"artistic value\" whereas Maggie and her mother cherish these items because they \"remind them of their loved ones.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> In Mama\u2019s mind, Maggie learning to make her own quilt and putting it to \"everyday use\" is preserving the culture. She believes it should be used and if they \"end up in rags,\" more quilts can simply be made. <ref name=\":1\" /> On the other hand, Dee believes the proper way to preserve her culture is to display the quilt in her home and preserve the quilt itself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/everyday-use/themes|title=Everyday Use Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-11-03}}</ref> \n\n== Point of view ==\nBecause this story is told in [[first-person narrative|first-person]] the readers \"watch\" the story unfold through the eyes and opinions of Mama.  As Maggie and Mama wait for Dee to arrive for a visit Mama's mind wanders with various thoughts and memories of Dee, giving the audience an impartial view of Dee as being self-centered and uncaring.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Farrell|first=Susan|title=Fight vs. Flight: a re-evaluation of Dee in Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Literature Resource Center|volume= 35|issue= 2|via=}}</ref> Due to the fact that readers are getting only one view point it is uncertain if Dee truly does exhibit these characteristics or if it is only Mama's opinion of the eldest daughter that is being forced upon us.  It is thought by some that Mama does not judge Dee, nor Maggie, accurately due to Mama's own insecurities.<ref name=\":0\" />   This is evidenced during Mama's daydream of Dee and herself on an imaginary popular talk show under the context of children who have \"made it\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://intensiveenglish1.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/0/4/13041485/everyday_use_full-text.pdf|title=Everyday Use|website=weebly.com}}</ref> Mama notes being over-weight and rough around the edges and eludes to the fact that Dee is ashamed of Mama's appearance.<ref name=\":1\" />  As Mama continues to narrate the story the audience continues to get a sense of Dee's snobbish personality, along with moments of doubt as readers see glimpses of Mamas own short comings.  As the story concludes the audience is left with the vision of Mama and Maggie remaining alone, once again, on the front lawn; happy to be rid of Dee and the exhausting perfection as they bask in the simplicity of each other and the straight forward life that has been built.\n\n===Interpretations===\nIn the essay \"'Everyday Use' and the Black Power Movement\" by [[Barbara Christian|Barbara T. Christian]], the story is discussed in reference to slavery and the black power movement. The characters in the story focus a lot on African culture and heritage. Traditional African clothing is described throughout the story, and this is a symbol of the family's heritage. The mentioning of changing names relates back to slavery as well; the characters were trying to forget about their slave names, and think of more traditional names to remember their culture and \"[affirm] their African roots.\" Christian brings to light the difference in attitudes and perspectives about a shared culture. Christian points out that to Maggie and her mother, honoring their culture meant honoring the personal past of their family, by carrying on their names or putting the quilt to use, while to Dee, that meant honoring aesthetic and ancient traditions, such as traditional African names or hanging the quilt to be seen but not utilized. It is this very realization that leads to their mother choosing to give Maggie the quilts. <ref>{{Cite book|title=\"everyday use\" and the black power movement|last=Christian|first=Barbara|publisher=Pearson|year=1994|isbn=0-13-458638-7|location=|pages=492\u2013494}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, in the essay \"'Everyday Use' as a Portrait of the Artist\" by Mary Helen Washington, the story is looked at from a more artistic and cultural perspective. The essay describes Dee as an artist who \"returns home...in order to collect the material,\" which indicates that Dee comes home for a deeper understanding of her African culture. Although she changes her name from Dee to a more Native African name and wears African clothing, she lacks real knowledge of her culture. Because of this, Mama chooses Maggie over Dee to take the quilts, because Maggie shows more appreciation and knowledge of their culture and as she said in the story was involved in the making of those quilts whereas Dee had no part in.\n\nIn the essay \u201cStylish vs. Sacred in \u201cEveryday Use\u201d written by Houston A.

Quilting requires sewing pieces of cloth together to create a coverlet that functions as both a piece of art and a household item. African-American women, often regarded as voiceless \u2018mule(s) of the world\u2019, inherited such creative legacies from maternal ancestors and their quilts have come to represent black heritage.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens|journal=Within the Circle: An Anthology of African American Literary Criticism from the Harlem Renaissance to the Present|first=Alice|last=Walker|publisher=(Durham and London: Duke University Press, 1994)|page=402}}</ref> The voices of African-American women have been stitched into their quilts, providing an account of their cultural past.

The communal nature of quilting strengthened the bonds of sisterhood and helped to move marginalized women from enslavement to empowerment. Quilting allowed these women to assert control over the colonial practice of slavery as enforced by white hegemony. Historically, products such as cotton and indigo dye were acquired as a result of black oppression. By sewing cotton into their quilts, African-American slaves formed a bond with nature, which replaced the hegemonic relationship enforced by slavery.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Jennifer|last=Martin|title=The Quilt Threads Together Sisterhood, Empowerment and Nature in Alice Walker's ''The Colour Purple'' and \"Everyday Use\"|journal=Journal of Intercultural Disciplines|volume=14|date=2014|pages=27\u201343 (38)}}</ref>\n\nBlack slaves often attended communal Quilting Bees, which offered these oppressed women the opportunity to create social bonds unsupervised. Thus, quilting became a symbol of sisterly solidarity for African-American slaves. Additionally, quilting functioned as a response to cultural and political change, allowing opportunity for political debate. Black women used quilting as a source of activism: their quilts often depicted anti-slavery slogans. However, quilting also came to represent the hegemony of patriarchal society. Women were often forced to learn to quilt, which became a substitute for the more \u2018masculine\u2019 activity of reading and writing.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Elaine|last=Hedges|title=Quilts and Women's Culture|journal=The Radical Teacher|volume=4|date=1977|pages=7\u201310 (10)}}</ref>\n\nQuilting features in \u2018Everyday Use\u2019 as a symbol of black heritage. Mama Johnson\u2019s quilts symbolizes cross-generational female bonding: they were sewn together by Grandma Dee, passed down to and then quilted by Mama and her sister, Big Dee. One quilt even features a piece of the war uniform worn by their Great Grandpa Ezra during the Civil War. These quilts represent the creativity of the sisterhood that created them; however, Mama\u2019s daughters, Maggie and Dee, view them very differently. Dee visits her family, intending to collect the artifacts of her family\u2019s past; she wants to display them in her home with museum-like accuracy. As David Cowart notes, \u2018The visitor [Dee] rightly recognizes the quilts as part of a fragile heritage, but she fails to see the extent to which she herself has traduced that heritage.\u2019<ref>{{Cite journal|first=David|last=Cowart|title=Heritage and Deracination in Walker's \"Everyday Use\"|journal=Studies in Short Fiction|volume=33|date=1996|pages=171\u2013183 (172)}}</ref> The story\u2019s climax, which sees Mama give the quilts to Maggie, rather than Dee, is viewed as representative of the quilts\u2019 functionality. Dee views the quilts as worthy of museum display (\"Maggie can't appreciate these quilts!...She'd probably be backward enough to put them to everyday use.\"), whilst Maggie treats them as household items (\"I been saving 'em for long enough with nobody using 'em. I hope [ Maggie puts them to \u2018everyday use\u2019]!\u201d).<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Alice|last=Walker|title=Everyday Use|journal=In Love and Trouble|publisher=New York: Harvest Books, 1974)|pages= 314\u2013321 (p. 320)}}</ref> Both Mama and Maggie recognise that the quilt is meant for \u2018everyday use\u2019, as practiced by their ancestors.\n\n==Reception==\nIn critical readings of this article, the largest trend regarding this story has been to criticize Dee and the way she goes about her personal cultural reclamation.  However, Matthew Mullins argues in his essay, ''Antagonized by the Text, Or, It Takes Two to Read Alice Walker\u2019s \u201cEveryday Use\u201d'', that this perspective isn\u2019t necessarily fair.  He found in reading and teaching the text, Dee was universally a disliked character, saying that in an epiphany he found in his defense of Dee rather a pitying attitude and concluding that \u201cit was impossible to see how anyone could truly \u2018like\u2019 Dee\u201d.  This, however, he goes on to point out as not being a direct result of Dee\u2019s actions alone, but rather the framing of her actions in the story.  He argues that the text itself is what antagonizes the reader to grow this dislike of Dee: \u201cThe first-person narrative voice, the fact that Mrs. Johnson [Mama] is both narrator and character, has an immediate and forceful effect upon our perception of Dee.\u201d  Mullins backs this up by quoting another scholar, Wayne Booth, who said in his work The Rhetoric of Fiction, \u201cNo narrator [\u2026] is simply convincing: he is convincingly decent or mean, brilliant or stupid, informed, intelligent, or muddled. [\u2026] we usually find our emotional and intellectual reactions to him as a character affects our reactions to the events he relates.\u201d  Mullins points out that if Dee herself, or even Maggie, were the narrators of the story, we would come away with a completely different perspective on probably all of the characters.  \u201cThe text actively prevents us from identifying with Dee,\u201d and this perspective has shaped the scholarly resources on this text since it came out.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mullins|first1=Matthew|title=Antagonized by the Text, Or, It Takes Two to Read Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Journal of the Southern Comparative Literature Association|date=May 2013|volume=37|pages=37\u201353|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2013392796&site=ehost-live|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\nJoe Sarnowski, in his article ''Destroying to Save: Idealism and Pragmatism in Alice Walker\u2019s \u2018Everyday Use\u2019'', also points out this discrepancy but taking it one step further, arguing that even though it would be naive to claim Dee doesn\u2019t have faults, she, \u201cmore than any other character in the story, identifies and pursues corrective measures against the oppression of African-American society and culture.\u201d  Her fault, Sarnowski says, is in not realizing how idealism and pragmatism are \u201cintertwined\u201d and how \u201cprivileging one undermines both\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sarnowski|first1=Joe|title=Destroying to Save: Idealism and Pragmatism in Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Papers on Language and Literature: A Journal for Scholars and Critics of Language and Literature|date=2012|volume=48|issue=3|pages=269\u2013286|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2012582914&site=ehost-live|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Walker, Alice. \"Everyday Use.\" ''The Story and Its Writer''.

It was first published in 1973 as part of Walker's short story collection ''In Love and Trouble''.\n\nThe short story is told in  [[first-person narrative|first person]] by \"Mama\", an African-American woman living in the [[Deep South]] with one of her two daughters. The story follows the differences between Mrs. Johnson and her shy younger daughter Maggie, who both still adhere to traditional black culture in the rural South, and her educated, successful daughter Dee, or \"Wangero\" as she prefers to be called, who takes a different route to reclaiming her cultural identity.\n\nA film version was released in 2005.\n\n==<span lang=\"fa\" dir=\"rtl\">Plot</span>==\nThe story opens on Mama waiting in the yard for her oldest daughter, Dee\u2019s, visit.  She reflects on the differences between Dee and Maggie, her youngest daughter, and knows that Maggie will be anxious and self-conscious around Dee. Maggie was burned in a house fire that happened more than a decade ago. Mama carried her out in her arms, as Dee watched the house burn. Dee was seemingly happy and excited about the fire, due to her extreme dislike for the house. The narrator continues to paint a picture of Maggie as helpless and rather awkward, whereas Dee is beautiful and seems to have had an easier time in life.\n\nDee left home to pursue an education in Augusta, afforded to her by Mama and the community\u2019s fund raising efforts. Mama never attended school past second grade, and Maggie has a very limited reading ability, so Dee\u2019s education is a stark difference and Mama seems to feel that starkness, commenting, \u201clike dimwits, we seemed about to understand\u201d. <ref name=\":1\" />  Mama discusses the physical differences between the three: her own manly looks, Maggie\u2019s timid disposition, and Dee\u2019s own nice hair, full figure, and stylish way of dress.\n\nWhen Dee finally arrives, she is accompanied by a man, whom Mama refers to as Hakim-a-barber. Mama and Maggie are a little taken aback by Dee's wild-looking outfit and her African greeting to them. Dee takes photos of Mama and Maggie in front of the house, and the greetings are stiff and unfamiliar. Dee informs her mother that she has now changed her name to Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo in order to protest the oppression and cultural white washing Black Americans faced. Mama rejects this, telling Dee she was named after her Aunt Dicie, who in turn was named after Grandma Dee, and that the name went on through the generations. Dee gives Mama the option of not using her new name, and Mama concludes that Hakim-a-barber must be related to a family of Muslims down the road. Hakim-a-barber says he accepts some of the doctrines of his beef-raising family, but is not interested in farming or herding as a profession.\n\nMama does not know whether Hakim-a-barber and Dee are married, nor does she ask. Hakim-a-barber has a restricted diet to follow, but Dee digs into the food Mama made. She begins asking for things around the house, like the top of a butter churn, and eventually she asks for two quilts as well.  This quilt in particular is one that Mama had promised to Maggie, and Dee\u2019s persistence frustrates Mama which develops into an argument between Mama and Dee. Dee argues that by using the quilt as a normal item, in \u201ceveryday use\u201d, the quilt will be ruined, and the cultural importance will be lost. Mama would rather the item be used practically by her family and be ruined than have it sit on a shelf or be hung on a wall as a piece of art, and as Dee readies to leave, she tells Mama that Mama doesn\u2019t understand her own heritage.  She adds that Mama should try and improve, and that there is a new path for Black Americans to follow. Maggie and Mama sit in the yard after watching them drive off, until bedtime.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Dee''' \u2013 She is an educated African-American woman and the eldest daughter of Mama. She seeks to embrace her cultural identity through changing her name from Dee to Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo (an African name), marrying a Muslim man, and acquiring artifacts from Mama's house to put on display, an approach that puts her at odds with Mama and Maggie.  She is physically beautiful and is described as having a great sense of style.\n* '''Mama''' \u2013 She is described as a \"large, big-boned woman with rough, man-working hands.\"<ref name=\":1\" />  She enjoys her lifestyle (especially milking cows) and did not receive an education past second grade.\n* '''Maggie''' \u2013 Described by Mama as dull and unattractive, the youngest daughter Maggie has burn scars and marks from the burning down of their prior home, and is very nervous and self-conscious because of it. She leads a simple and traditional life with her mother in the South while her elder sister, Dee, is away at school.  She has very limited reading ability, unlike her sister Dee.\n* '''Hakim-a-barber''' \u2013 Dee\u2019s partner, he is referred to as \"Asalamalakim\", which is a Muslim greeting, throughout the story because he is Muslim.  Eventually he tells Mama to call him \"Hakim-a-barber\" due to Mama being unable to pronounce his real name.\n\n\n== Themes ==\nOne of the primary themes that the story revolves around is the idea of a person's relationship with their heritage.<ref name=\":2\">{{Citation|last=Walker, Alice, 1944-|title=Everyday use|date=2004|publisher=Recording for the Blind & Dyslexic|oclc=55770645}}</ref> In the story, Dee's mother remained close to immediate family traditions, while Dee herself chose to search more deeply into her African roots. Because of her different mindset, she does not have the same ideals as Mama and Maggie, particularly in regard to cultural preservation and the best way to go about it. Dee (Wangero) only wants the family heirlooms to display in her home for their \"artistic value\" whereas Maggie and her mother cherish these items because they \"remind them of their loved ones.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> In Mama\u2019s mind, Maggie learning to make her own quilt and putting it to \"everyday use\" is preserving the culture. She believes it should be used and if they \"end up in rags,\" more quilts can simply be made. <ref name=\":1\" /> On the other hand, Dee believes the proper way to preserve her culture is to display the quilt in her home and preserve the quilt itself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/everyday-use/themes|title=Everyday Use Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-11-03}}</ref> \n\n== Point of view ==\nBecause this story is told in [[first-person narrative|first-person]] the readers \"watch\" the story unfold through the eyes and opinions of Mama.  As Maggie and Mama wait for Dee to arrive for a visit Mama's mind wanders with various thoughts and memories of Dee, giving the audience an impartial view of Dee as being self-centered and uncaring.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Farrell|first=Susan|title=Fight vs. Flight: a re-evaluation of Dee in Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Literature Resource Center|volume= 35|issue= 2|via=}}</ref> Due to the fact that readers are getting only one view point it is uncertain if Dee truly does exhibit these characteristics or if it is only Mama's opinion of the eldest daughter that is being forced upon us.  It is thought by some that Mama does not judge Dee, nor Maggie, accurately due to Mama's own insecurities.<ref name=\":0\" />   This is evidenced during Mama's daydream of Dee and herself on an imaginary popular talk show under the context of children who have \"made it\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://intensiveenglish1.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/0/4/13041485/everyday_use_full-text.pdf|title=Everyday Use|website=weebly.com}}</ref> Mama notes being over-weight and rough around the edges and eludes to the fact that Dee is ashamed of Mama's appearance.<ref name=\":1\" />  As Mama continues to narrate the story the audience continues to get a sense of Dee's snobbish personality, along with moments of doubt as readers see glimpses of Mamas own short comings.  As the story concludes the audience is left with the vision of Mama and Maggie remaining alone, once again, on the front lawn; happy to be rid of Dee and the exhausting perfection as they bask in the simplicity of each other and the straight forward life that has been built.\n\n===Interpretations===\nIn the essay \"'Everyday Use' and the Black Power Movement\" by [[Barbara Christian|Barbara T.

Historically, products such as cotton and indigo dye were acquired as a result of black oppression. By sewing cotton into their quilts, African-American slaves formed a bond with nature, which replaced the hegemonic relationship enforced by slavery.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Jennifer|last=Martin|title=The Quilt Threads Together Sisterhood, Empowerment and Nature in Alice Walker's ''The Colour Purple'' and \"Everyday Use\"|journal=Journal of Intercultural Disciplines|volume=14|date=2014|pages=27\u201343 (38)}}</ref>\n\nBlack slaves often attended communal Quilting Bees, which offered these oppressed women the opportunity to create social bonds unsupervised. Thus, quilting became a symbol of sisterly solidarity for African-American slaves. Additionally, quilting functioned as a response to cultural and political change, allowing opportunity for political debate. Black women used quilting as a source of activism: their quilts often depicted anti-slavery slogans. However, quilting also came to represent the hegemony of patriarchal society. Women were often forced to learn to quilt, which became a substitute for the more \u2018masculine\u2019 activity of reading and writing.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Elaine|last=Hedges|title=Quilts and Women's Culture|journal=The Radical Teacher|volume=4|date=1977|pages=7\u201310 (10)}}</ref>\n\nQuilting features in \u2018Everyday Use\u2019 as a symbol of black heritage. Mama Johnson\u2019s quilts symbolizes cross-generational female bonding: they were sewn together by Grandma Dee, passed down to and then quilted by Mama and her sister, Big Dee. One quilt even features a piece of the war uniform worn by their Great Grandpa Ezra during the Civil War. These quilts represent the creativity of the sisterhood that created them; however, Mama\u2019s daughters, Maggie and Dee, view them very differently. Dee visits her family, intending to collect the artifacts of her family\u2019s past; she wants to display them in her home with museum-like accuracy. As David Cowart notes, \u2018The visitor [Dee] rightly recognizes the quilts as part of a fragile heritage, but she fails to see the extent to which she herself has traduced that heritage.\u2019<ref>{{Cite journal|first=David|last=Cowart|title=Heritage and Deracination in Walker's \"Everyday Use\"|journal=Studies in Short Fiction|volume=33|date=1996|pages=171\u2013183 (172)}}</ref> The story\u2019s climax, which sees Mama give the quilts to Maggie, rather than Dee, is viewed as representative of the quilts\u2019 functionality. Dee views the quilts as worthy of museum display (\"Maggie can't appreciate these quilts!...She'd probably be backward enough to put them to everyday use.\"), whilst Maggie treats them as household items (\"I been saving 'em for long enough with nobody using 'em. I hope [ Maggie puts them to \u2018everyday use\u2019]!\u201d).<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Alice|last=Walker|title=Everyday Use|journal=In Love and Trouble|publisher=New York: Harvest Books, 1974)|pages= 314\u2013321 (p. 320)}}</ref> Both Mama and Maggie recognise that the quilt is meant for \u2018everyday use\u2019, as practiced by their ancestors.\n\n==Reception==\nIn critical readings of this article, the largest trend regarding this story has been to criticize Dee and the way she goes about her personal cultural reclamation.  However, Matthew Mullins argues in his essay, ''Antagonized by the Text, Or, It Takes Two to Read Alice Walker\u2019s \u201cEveryday Use\u201d'', that this perspective isn\u2019t necessarily fair.  He found in reading and teaching the text, Dee was universally a disliked character, saying that in an epiphany he found in his defense of Dee rather a pitying attitude and concluding that \u201cit was impossible to see how anyone could truly \u2018like\u2019 Dee\u201d.  This, however, he goes on to point out as not being a direct result of Dee\u2019s actions alone, but rather the framing of her actions in the story.  He argues that the text itself is what antagonizes the reader to grow this dislike of Dee: \u201cThe first-person narrative voice, the fact that Mrs. Johnson [Mama] is both narrator and character, has an immediate and forceful effect upon our perception of Dee.\u201d  Mullins backs this up by quoting another scholar, Wayne Booth, who said in his work The Rhetoric of Fiction, \u201cNo narrator [\u2026] is simply convincing: he is convincingly decent or mean, brilliant or stupid, informed, intelligent, or muddled. [\u2026] we usually find our emotional and intellectual reactions to him as a character affects our reactions to the events he relates.\u201d  Mullins points out that if Dee herself, or even Maggie, were the narrators of the story, we would come away with a completely different perspective on probably all of the characters.  \u201cThe text actively prevents us from identifying with Dee,\u201d and this perspective has shaped the scholarly resources on this text since it came out.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mullins|first1=Matthew|title=Antagonized by the Text, Or, It Takes Two to Read Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Journal of the Southern Comparative Literature Association|date=May 2013|volume=37|pages=37\u201353|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2013392796&site=ehost-live|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\nJoe Sarnowski, in his article ''Destroying to Save: Idealism and Pragmatism in Alice Walker\u2019s \u2018Everyday Use\u2019'', also points out this discrepancy but taking it one step further, arguing that even though it would be naive to claim Dee doesn\u2019t have faults, she, \u201cmore than any other character in the story, identifies and pursues corrective measures against the oppression of African-American society and culture.\u201d  Her fault, Sarnowski says, is in not realizing how idealism and pragmatism are \u201cintertwined\u201d and how \u201cprivileging one undermines both\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sarnowski|first1=Joe|title=Destroying to Save: Idealism and Pragmatism in Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Papers on Language and Literature: A Journal for Scholars and Critics of Language and Literature|date=2012|volume=48|issue=3|pages=269\u2013286|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2012582914&site=ehost-live|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Walker, Alice. \"Everyday Use.\" ''The Story and Its Writer''.

It has also been used for some non-Tibetic languages in close cultural contact with Tibet, such as [[Thakali language|Thakali]].<ref>http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/kailash/pdf/kailash_09_01_02.pdf</ref> The printed form is called [[uchen script]] while the hand-written cursive form used in everyday writing is called [[um\u00ea script]].\n\nThe script is closely linked to a broad ethnic Tibetan identity, spanning across areas in [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Bhutan]] and [[Tibet]].<ref>Chamberlain 2008</ref> The Tibetan script is of [[Brahmic scripts|Indic]] origin and it is ancestral to the [[Limbu script]], the [[Lepcha script]]<ref name=\"daniels\">Daniels, Peter T. and William Bright. ''The World's Writing Systems''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1996.</ref> and the multilingual [['Phags-pa script]].<ref name=\"daniels\" />\n\n==History==\n\nThe creation of the Tibetan alphabet is attributed to [[Thonmi Sambhota]] of the mid-7th century. Tradition holds that Thonmi Sambhota, a minister of [[Songtsen Gampo]] in 7th century, was sent to [[India]] to study the art of writing, and upon his return introduced the alphabet. The form of the [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]]s is based on an [[Indic script|Indic alphabet]] of that period.<ref>Which specific Indic script inspired the Tibetan alphabet remains controversial. Recent study suggests Tibetan script was based on an adaption from Khotan of the Indian Brahmi and Gupta scripts taught to Thonmi Sambhota in Kashmir (Berzin, Alexander. ''A Survey of Tibetan History - Reading Notes Taken by Alexander Berzin from Tsepon, W. D. Shakabpa, Tibet: A Political History. New Haven, Yale University Press, 1967: http://studybuddhism.com/web/en/archives/e-books/unpublished_manuscripts/survey_tibetan_history/chapter_1.html).</ref>\n\nThree orthographic standardisations were developed. The most important, an official orthography aimed to facilitate the translation of [[Buddhist scriptures]], emerged during the early 9th century. Standard orthography has not altered since then, while the spoken language [[sound change|has changed]] by, for example, losing complex [[consonant cluster]]s. As a result, in all modern Tibetan dialects, in particular in the [[Standard Tibetan]] of [[Lhasa]], there is a great divergence between current spelling (which still reflects the 9th-century spoken Tibetan) and current pronunciation. This divergence is the basis of an argument in favour of [[spelling reform]], to write Tibetan ''as it is pronounced'', for example, writing ''[[Kagyu]]'' instead of ''Bka'-rgyud''. In contrast, the pronunciation of the [[Balti language|Balti]], [[Ladakhi language|Ladakhi]] and [[Burig]] languages adheres more closely to the original spelling.\n\nNew research and writings suggest that there were Tibetan script, prior to [[Songtsen Gampo]] and [[Thonmi Sambhota]]. The Tunhong manuscripts ([[dunhuang manuscript]]) are great evidence. <ref>{{cite book |last1=Phuntsok |first1=Thubten |title=\u0f56\u0f7c\u0f51\u0f0b\u0f40\u0fb1\u0f72\u0f0b\u0f63\u0f7c\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f92\u0fb1\u0f74\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f66\u0fa4\u0fb1\u0f72\u0f0b\u0f51\u0f7c\u0f53\u0f0b\u0f54\u0f51\u0fa8\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f0b\u0f42\u0f71\u0f60\u0f72\u0f0b\u0f63\u0fa1\u0f7a\u0f0b\u0f58\u0f72\u0f42 \"A General History of Tibet\"}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n\n===Basic alphabet===\n\nIn the Tibetan script, the [[syllable]]s are written from left to right. Syllables are separated by a ''tsek'' (\u0f0b); since many Tibetan words are monosyllabic, this mark often functions almost as a space. Spaces are not used to divide words.\n\nThe Tibetan alphabet has thirty basic letters, sometimes known as \"radicals\", for consonants.<ref name=\"daniels\">Daniels, Peter T. and William Bright. ''The World's Writing Systems''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1996.</ref> As in other [[Indic scripts]], each consonant letter assumes an [[inherent vowel]]; in the Tibetan script it is /a/. The letter {{bo-textonly|\u0f68}} is also the base for dependent vowel marks.\n\nAlthough some Tibetan dialects are [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal]], the language had no tone at the time of the script's invention, and there are no dedicated symbols for tone. However, since tones developed from segmental features they can usually be correctly predicted by the archaic spelling of Tibetan words.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:75%\"\n|-align=center style=\"font-size:small\"\n!\n!style=\"background:beige;\" colspan=2 | Unaspirated<br/>''high''\n!style=\"background:#d6f5d6;\" colspan=2 | [[Aspirated consonant|Aspirated]]<br />''medium''\n!style=\"background:#ffcce6;\" colspan=2 | [[Voiced]]<br/ >''low''\n!style=\"background:#99bbff;\" colspan=2 | [[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]<br />''low''\n|-align=center style=\"font-size:small\"\n!\n!

In both cases, the symbol for {{bo-textonly|\u0f40}} /ka/ is used, but when the {{bo-textonly|\u0f62}} /ra/ is in the middle of the consonant and vowel, it is added as a subscript.  On the other hand, when the {{bo-textonly|\u0f62}} /ra/ comes before the consonant and vowel, it is added as a superscript.<ref name=\"daniels\" /> {{bo-textonly|\u0f62}} /ra/ actually changes form when it is above most other consonants; thus {{bo-textonly|\u0f62\u0f90}} rka.  However, an exception to this is the cluster {{bo-textonly|\u0f62\u0f99}} /r\u0272a/.  Similarly, the consonants {{bo-textonly|\u0f5d}} /wa/, {{bo-textonly|\u0f62}} /ra/, and {{bo-textonly|\u0f61}} /ja/ change form when they are beneath other consonants; thus {{bo-textonly|\u0f40\u0fad}} /kwa/; {{bo-textonly|\u0f40\u0fb2}} /kra/; {{bo-textonly|\u0f40\u0fb1}} /kja/.\n\nBesides being written as subscripts and superscripts, some consonants can also be placed in prescript, postscript, or post-postscript positions.

In [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] 12.04, one can install Tibetan language support through Dash / Language Support / Install/Remove Languages, the input method can be turned on from Dash / Keyboard Layout, adding Tibetan keyboard layout. The layout applies the similar layout as in Microsoft Windows.\n\n[[Mac OS]]-X introduced Tibetan Unicode support with OS-X version 10.5 and later, now with three different keyboard layouts available: Tibetan-Wylie, Tibetan QWERTY and Tibetan-Otani.\n\n===Dzongkha===\n[[File:Dzongkha Keyboard layout Main.svg|thumb|300px|[[Dzongkha]] keyboard layout]]\n{{Main|Dzongkha keyboard layout}}\nThe Dzongkha keyboard layout scheme is designed as a simple means for inputting [[Dzongkha]] text on computers. This keyboard layout was standardized by the [[Dzongkha Development Commission]] (DDC) and the [[Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications, Bhutan| Department of Information Technology]] (DIT) of the [[Royal Government of Bhutan]] in 2000.\n\nIt was updated in 2009 to accommodate additional characters added to the [[Unicode]] & [[Universal Coded Character Set|ISO 10646]] standards since the initial version. Since the arrangement of keys essentially follows the usual order of the Dzongkha and Tibetan alphabet, the layout can be quickly learned by anyone familiar with this alphabet. Subjoined (combining) consonants are entered using the Shift key.\n\nThe Dzongkha (dz) keyboard layout is included in Microsoft Windows, Android, and most distributions of Linux as part of [[XFree86]].\n\n==Unicode==\n\n{{Main|Tibetan (Unicode block)}}\n\nTibetan was originally one of the scripts in the first version of the [[Unicode]] Standard in 1991, in the Unicode block U+1000&ndash;U+104F. However, in 1993, in version 1.1, it was removed (the code points it took up would later be used for the [[Burmese script]] in version 3.0). The Tibetan script was re-added in July, 1996 with the release of version 2.0.\n\nThe Unicode block for Tibetan is U+0F00&ndash;U+0FFF. It includes letters, digits and various punctuation marks and special symbols used in religious texts:\n\n{{Unicode chart Tibetan}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Tibetan calligraphy]]\n* [[Tibetan Braille]]\n* [[Dzongkha Braille]]\n* [[:Category:Tibetan typefaces|Tibetan typefaces]]\n* [[Wylie transliteration]]\n* [[Tibetan pinyin]]\n* [[THDL Simplified Phonetic Transcription]]\n* [[Tise]], input method for Tibetan script\n* [[Limbu script]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*Asher, R.

It has also been used for some non-Tibetic languages in close cultural contact with Tibet, such as [[Thakali language|Thakali]].<ref>http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/kailash/pdf/kailash_09_01_02.pdf</ref> The printed form is called [[uchen script]] while the hand-written cursive form used in everyday writing is called [[um\u00ea script]].\n\nThe script is closely linked to a broad ethnic Tibetan identity, spanning across areas in [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Bhutan]] and [[Tibet]].<ref>Chamberlain 2008</ref> The Tibetan script is of [[Brahmic scripts|Indic]] origin and it is ancestral to the [[Limbu script]], the [[Lepcha script]]<ref name=\"daniels\">Daniels, Peter T. and William Bright. ''The World's Writing Systems''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1996.</ref> and the multilingual [['Phags-pa script]].<ref name=\"daniels\" />\n\n==History==\n\nThe creation of the Tibetan alphabet is attributed to [[Thonmi Sambhota]] of the mid-7th century. Tradition holds that Thonmi Sambhota, a minister of [[Songtsen Gampo]] in 7th century, was sent to [[India]] to study the art of writing, and upon his return introduced the alphabet. The form of the [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]]s is based on an [[Indic script|Indic alphabet]] of that period.<ref>Which specific Indic script inspired the Tibetan alphabet remains controversial. Recent study suggests Tibetan script was based on an adaption from Khotan of the Indian Brahmi and Gupta scripts taught to Thonmi Sambhota in Kashmir (Berzin, Alexander. ''A Survey of Tibetan History - Reading Notes Taken by Alexander Berzin from Tsepon, W. D. Shakabpa, Tibet: A Political History. New Haven, Yale University Press, 1967: http://studybuddhism.com/web/en/archives/e-books/unpublished_manuscripts/survey_tibetan_history/chapter_1.html).</ref>\n\nThree orthographic standardisations were developed. The most important, an official orthography aimed to facilitate the translation of [[Buddhist scriptures]], emerged during the early 9th century. Standard orthography has not altered since then, while the spoken language [[sound change|has changed]] by, for example, losing complex [[consonant cluster]]s. As a result, in all modern Tibetan dialects, in particular in the [[Standard Tibetan]] of [[Lhasa]], there is a great divergence between current spelling (which still reflects the 9th-century spoken Tibetan) and current pronunciation. This divergence is the basis of an argument in favour of [[spelling reform]], to write Tibetan ''as it is pronounced'', for example, writing ''[[Kagyu]]'' instead of ''Bka'-rgyud''. In contrast, the pronunciation of the [[Balti language|Balti]], [[Ladakhi language|Ladakhi]] and [[Burig]] languages adheres more closely to the original spelling.\n\nNew research and writings suggest that there were Tibetan script, prior to [[Songtsen Gampo]] and [[Thonmi Sambhota]]. The Tunhong manuscripts ([[dunhuang manuscript]]) are great evidence. <ref>{{cite book |last1=Phuntsok |first1=Thubten |title=\u0f56\u0f7c\u0f51\u0f0b\u0f40\u0fb1\u0f72\u0f0b\u0f63\u0f7c\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f92\u0fb1\u0f74\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f66\u0fa4\u0fb1\u0f72\u0f0b\u0f51\u0f7c\u0f53\u0f0b\u0f54\u0f51\u0fa8\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f0b\u0f42\u0f71\u0f60\u0f72\u0f0b\u0f63\u0fa1\u0f7a\u0f0b\u0f58\u0f72\u0f42 \"A General History of Tibet\"}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n\n===Basic alphabet===\n\nIn the Tibetan script, the [[syllable]]s are written from left to right. Syllables are separated by a ''tsek'' (\u0f0b); since many Tibetan words are monosyllabic, this mark often functions almost as a space. Spaces are not used to divide words.\n\nThe Tibetan alphabet has thirty basic letters, sometimes known as \"radicals\", for consonants.<ref name=\"daniels\">Daniels, Peter T. and William Bright. ''The World's Writing Systems''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1996.</ref> As in other [[Indic scripts]], each consonant letter assumes an [[inherent vowel]]; in the Tibetan script it is /a/. The letter {{bo-textonly|\u0f68}} is also the base for dependent vowel marks.\n\nAlthough some Tibetan dialects are [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal]], the language had no tone at the time of the script's invention, and there are no dedicated symbols for tone. However, since tones developed from segmental features they can usually be correctly predicted by the archaic spelling of Tibetan words.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:75%\"\n|-align=center style=\"font-size:small\"\n!\n!style=\"background:beige;\" colspan=2 | Unaspirated<br/>''high''\n!style=\"background:#d6f5d6;\" colspan=2 | [[Aspirated consonant|Aspirated]]<br />''medium''\n!style=\"background:#ffcce6;\" colspan=2 | [[Voiced]]<br/ >''low''\n!style=\"background:#99bbff;\" colspan=2 | [[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]<br />''low''\n|-align=center style=\"font-size:small\"\n!\n!

In both cases, the symbol for {{bo-textonly|\u0f40}} /ka/ is used, but when the {{bo-textonly|\u0f62}} /ra/ is in the middle of the consonant and vowel, it is added as a subscript.  On the other hand, when the {{bo-textonly|\u0f62}} /ra/ comes before the consonant and vowel, it is added as a superscript.<ref name=\"daniels\" /> {{bo-textonly|\u0f62}} /ra/ actually changes form when it is above most other consonants; thus {{bo-textonly|\u0f62\u0f90}} rka.  However, an exception to this is the cluster {{bo-textonly|\u0f62\u0f99}} /r\u0272a/.  Similarly, the consonants {{bo-textonly|\u0f5d}} /wa/, {{bo-textonly|\u0f62}} /ra/, and {{bo-textonly|\u0f61}} /ja/ change form when they are beneath other consonants; thus {{bo-textonly|\u0f40\u0fad}} /kwa/; {{bo-textonly|\u0f40\u0fb2}} /kra/; {{bo-textonly|\u0f40\u0fb1}} /kja/.\n\nBesides being written as subscripts and superscripts, some consonants can also be placed in prescript, postscript, or post-postscript positions. For instance, the consonants {{bo-textonly|\u0f42}} /\u02b0ka/, {{bo-textonly|\u0f51}} /\u02b0ta/, {{bo-textonly|\u0f56}} /\u02b0pa/, {{bo-textonly|\u0f58}} /ma/ and {{bo-textonly|\u0f60}} /a/ can be used in the prescript position to the left of other radicals, while the position after a radical (the postscript position), can be held by the ten consonants {{bo-textonly|\u0f42}} /\u02b0ka/, {{bo-textonly|\u0f53}} /na/, {{bo-textonly|\u0f56}} /\u02b0pa/, {{bo-textonly|\u0f51}} /\u02b0ta/, {{bo-textonly|\u0f58}} /ma/, {{bo-textonly|\u0f60}} /a/, {{bo-textonly|\u0f62}} /ra/, {{bo-textonly|\u0f44}} /\u014ba/, {{bo-textonly|\u0f66}} /sa/, and {{bo-textonly|\u0f63}} /la/. The third position, the post-postscript position is solely for the consonants {{bo-textonly|\u0f51}} /\u02b0ta/ and {{bo-textonly|\u0f66}} /sa/.<ref name=\"daniels\" />\n\n====Head letters====\nThe superscript position above a radical is reserved for the consonants {{bo-textonly|\u0f62}} /ra/, {{bo-textonly|\u0f63}} /la/, and {{bo-textonly|\u0f66}} /sa/.\n\n*When {{bo-textonly|\u0f62}} /ra/, {{bo-textonly|\u0f63}} /la/, and {{bo-textonly|\u0f66}} /sa/ are in superscript position with {{bo-textonly|\u0f40}} /ka/, {{bo-textonly|\u0f45}} /t\u0283a/, {{bo-textonly|\u0f4f}} /ta/, {{bo-textonly|\u0f54}} /pa/ and {{bo-textonly|\u0f59}} /tsa/, there are no changes in the sound, they look and sound like:\n**{{bo-textonly|\u0f62\u0f90}} /ka/, {{bo-textonly|\u0f62\u0f9f}} /ta/, {{bo-textonly|\u0f62\u0fa4}} /pa/, {{bo-textonly|\u0f62\u0fa9}} /tsa/\n**{{bo-textonly|\u0f63\u0f90}} /ka/, {{bo-textonly|\u0f63\u0f95}} /t\u0283a/, {{bo-textonly|\u0f63\u0f9f}} /ta/, {{bo-textonly|\u0f63\u0fa4}} /pa/, \n**{{bo-textonly|\u0f66\u0f90}} /ka/, {{bo-textonly|\u0f66\u0f95}} /t\u0283a/, {{bo-textonly|\u0f66\u0f9f}} /ta/, {{bo-textonly|\u0f66\u0fa4}} /pa/, {{bo-textonly|\u0f66\u0fa9}} /tsa/\n*When {{bo-textonly|\u0f62}} /ra/, {{bo-textonly|\u0f63}} /la/, and {{bo-textonly|\u0f66}} /sa/ are in superscript position with {{bo-textonly|\u0f42}} /\u02b0ka/, {{bo-textonly|\u0f47}} /\u02b0t\u0283a/, {{bo-textonly|\u0f51}} /\u02b0ta/, {{bo-textonly|\u0f56}} /\u02b0pa/ and {{bo-textonly|\u0f5b}} /\u02b0tsa/, they lose their aspiration and become voiced.

The layout has been available in [[Linux]] since September 2007. In [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] 12.04, one can install Tibetan language support through Dash / Language Support / Install/Remove Languages, the input method can be turned on from Dash / Keyboard Layout, adding Tibetan keyboard layout. The layout applies the similar layout as in Microsoft Windows.\n\n[[Mac OS]]-X introduced Tibetan Unicode support with OS-X version 10.5 and later, now with three different keyboard layouts available: Tibetan-Wylie, Tibetan QWERTY and Tibetan-Otani.\n\n===Dzongkha===\n[[File:Dzongkha Keyboard layout Main.svg|thumb|300px|[[Dzongkha]] keyboard layout]]\n{{Main|Dzongkha keyboard layout}}\nThe Dzongkha keyboard layout scheme is designed as a simple means for inputting [[Dzongkha]] text on computers. This keyboard layout was standardized by the [[Dzongkha Development Commission]] (DDC) and the [[Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications, Bhutan| Department of Information Technology]] (DIT) of the [[Royal Government of Bhutan]] in 2000.\n\nIt was updated in 2009 to accommodate additional characters added to the [[Unicode]] & [[Universal Coded Character Set|ISO 10646]] standards since the initial version. Since the arrangement of keys essentially follows the usual order of the Dzongkha and Tibetan alphabet, the layout can be quickly learned by anyone familiar with this alphabet. Subjoined (combining) consonants are entered using the Shift key.\n\nThe Dzongkha (dz) keyboard layout is included in Microsoft Windows, Android, and most distributions of Linux as part of [[XFree86]].\n\n==Unicode==\n\n{{Main|Tibetan (Unicode block)}}\n\nTibetan was originally one of the scripts in the first version of the [[Unicode]] Standard in 1991, in the Unicode block U+1000&ndash;U+104F. However, in 1993, in version 1.1, it was removed (the code points it took up would later be used for the [[Burmese script]] in version 3.0). The Tibetan script was re-added in July, 1996 with the release of version 2.0.\n\nThe Unicode block for Tibetan is U+0F00&ndash;U+0FFF. It includes letters, digits and various punctuation marks and special symbols used in religious texts:\n\n{{Unicode chart Tibetan}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Tibetan calligraphy]]\n* [[Tibetan Braille]]\n* [[Dzongkha Braille]]\n* [[:Category:Tibetan typefaces|Tibetan typefaces]]\n* [[Wylie transliteration]]\n* [[Tibetan pinyin]]\n* [[THDL Simplified Phonetic Transcription]]\n* [[Tise]], input method for Tibetan script\n* [[Limbu script]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*Asher, R.

y>z -> {x,z,y,k}\n(* Rule[Condition[List[PatternSequence[x, BlankNullSequence[]], Pattern[y, Blank[]], Pattern[z, Blank[]], PatternSequence[k, BlankNullSequence[]]], Greater[y, z]], List[x, z, y, k]] *)\n</source>\nThe {{code|/;}} operator is \"condition\", so that the rule only applies when {{code|y>z}}. The three underscores are an syntax for a {{code|BlankNullSequence[]}}, for a sequence that can be null.\n\nA ReplaceRepeated {{code|//.}} operator can be used to apply this rule repeatedly, until no more change happens:\n<source lang=mathematica>\n{ 9, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4 } //. sortRule\n(* = ReplaceRepeated[{ 9, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4 }, sortRule] *)\n(* = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9} *)\n</source>\n\nThe pattern matching system also easily gives rise to rule-based integration and derivation.

y>z -> {x,z,y,k}\n(* Rule[Condition[List[PatternSequence[x, BlankNullSequence[]], Pattern[y, Blank[]], Pattern[z, Blank[]], PatternSequence[k, BlankNullSequence[]]], Greater[y, z]], List[x, z, y, k]] *)\n</source>\nThe {{code|/;}} operator is \"condition\", so that the rule only applies when {{code|y>z}}. The three underscores are an syntax for a {{code|BlankNullSequence[]}}, for a sequence that can be null.\n\nA ReplaceRepeated {{code|//.}} operator can be used to apply this rule repeatedly, until no more change happens:\n<source lang=mathematica>\n{ 9, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4 } //. sortRule\n(* = ReplaceRepeated[{ 9, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4 }, sortRule] *)\n(* = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9} *)\n</source>\n\nThe pattern matching system also easily gives rise to rule-based integration and derivation.
