It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nAmerican settlement on the Everett peninsula began in the 1860s, with several [[sawmill]]s built to serve the area's growing timber industry. Everett was [[plat]]ted by a group of investors seeking to build an industrial city and named for the son of co-founder Charles L. Colby. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major industrial center. Everett's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at [[Paine Field]] in 1967. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992. Everett received an [[All-America City Award]] in 2002.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history and settlement===\n[[File:everettwaterfront.jpg|thumb| [[Weyerhaeuser]] Lumber Mill, Everett Waterfront, c. early 1900s]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes who arrived in the region 10,000 years [[before present]] and settled near modern-day Everett approximately 2,000 years [[before present]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}} The [[Snohomish people]] lived around local waterways in the [[Possession Sound]] estuary and had a fortified winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first Europeans in the area were explorers from the 1792 [[Vancouver Expedition]], landing on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claiming the land for [[England]] on the birthday of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> [[Puget Sound]] was further explored and charted ny the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1824 and the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] under [[Charles Wilkes]] in 1841, ahead of a larger American presence in the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=4}}<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=https://www.historylink.org/file/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Snohomish and other Coast Salish tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, which relinquished their lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]] and established the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]], where they would be relocated.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] and built a cabin for himself.

It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nAmerican settlement on the Everett peninsula began in the 1860s, with several [[sawmill]]s built to serve the area's growing timber industry. Everett was [[plat]]ted by a group of investors seeking to build an industrial city and named for the son of co-founder Charles L. Colby. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major industrial center. Everett's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at [[Paine Field]] in 1967. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992. Everett received an [[All-America City Award]] in 2002.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history and settlement===\n[[File:everettwaterfront.jpg|thumb| [[Weyerhaeuser]] Lumber Mill, Everett Waterfront, c. early 1900s]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes who arrived in the region 10,000 years [[before present]] and settled near modern-day Everett approximately 2,000 years [[before present]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}} The [[Snohomish people]] lived around local waterways in the [[Possession Sound]] estuary and had a fortified winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first Europeans in the area were explorers from the 1792 [[Vancouver Expedition]], landing on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claiming the land for [[England]] on the birthday of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> [[Puget Sound]] was further explored and charted ny the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1824 and the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] under [[Charles Wilkes]] in 1841, ahead of a larger American presence in the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=4}}<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=https://www.historylink.org/file/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Snohomish and other Coast Salish tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, which relinquished their lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]] and established the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]], where they would be relocated.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] and built a cabin for himself.

It is a design tool for architects, landscape architects, urban designers, engineers, animators, illustrators and movie makers, industrial and interior designers and all other design areas. form\u00b7Z can be used on Windows as well as on Macintosh computers and in addition to English it is also available in German, Italian, Spanish, French, Greek, Korean and Japanese.\n\n==Modeling==\n\nIn general, form\u00b7Z allows design in 3D or in 2D, using numeric or interactive graphic input through either line or smooth shaded drawings ([[OpenGL]]) among drafting, modeling, rendering, and animation platforms.\n\n\nKey modeling features include [[Boolean operations on polygons|Boolean solids]] to generate complex composite objects; the ability to create curved surfacesfrom a variety of splines, including [[NURBS]] and [[B\u00e9zier curve|B\u00e9zier]]/[[Coons patch]]es; mechanical and organic forms using the previous as well as metaforms, patches, subdivisions, displacements, or skinning, plus specialty tools such as Terrain models, [[Platonic solid]]s, [[geodesic]] spheres, double line/wall objects, staircases, helixes, screws, and bolts. In addition, form\u00b7Z supports transforming and morphing of 3D shapes, and their animated capture therein.\n\nTechnical output oriented modeling allows users to refine the design with double precision CAD accuracy to full structural detail for 3D visualization for the production of 2D construction drawings, 3D printing, rapid prototyping, and [[Numerical control|CNC]] milling and offers information management of bills of materials and spreadsheet support for construction documents.\n==Verison History==\n\n\n==Animation==\n\nform\u00b7Z offers a seamlessly integrated animation environment, where objects, lights, cameras, and surface styles (colors) can be animated and transformed over time. The animation features are object-centric and are applied as modeling operations, which, in addition to supporting the production of animated visualizations, they also support dynamic modeling and the creation of forms that go significantly beyond the repertoire of conventional modeling tools. This offers a powerful avenue for design explorations.\n\n==Rendering==\n\nRenderZone Plus provides photorealistic rendering with [[global illumination]] based on final gather ([[Ray tracing (graphics)|raytrace]]), [[ambient occlusion]], and [[Radiosity (computer graphics)|radiosity]], for advanced simulation of lighting effects and rendering techniques, which result in renderings with the most realism, as the illumination of a scene takes into account the accurate distribution of light in the environment. Consequently, excellent results are achieved in a short time, with little effort to set up and easy to control.\n\nKey rendering features include multiple light types (distant (sun), cone, point, projector, area, custom, line, environment, and atmospheric) whereas the environment and atmospheric lights, which may be considered advanced light types, are especially optimized for global illumination. Both procedural and pre-captured textures are offered and can be mapped onto the surfaces of objects using six different mapping methods: flat, cubic, cylindrical, spherical, parametric, or UV coordinates. Decals can be attached on top of other surface styles to produce a variety of rendering effects, such as labels on objects, graffiti on walls, partially reflective surfaces, masked transparencies, and more. State of the art shaders are used to render surfaces and other effects. A surface style is defined by up to four layers of shaders, which produce color, reflections, transparency, and bump effects. They can be applied independently or can be correlated. Libraries with many predefined materials are included and can be easily extended and customized.\n\nAlso available is a sketch rendering mode that produces non photorealistic images, which appear as if they were drawn by manual rendering techniques, such as oil painting, water color, or pencil hatches.\n\n===Third Party Rendering Plugins===\n\n'''Maxwell'''\n\nMaxwell is a rendering engine developed by NextLimit based on the physics of real light.

Harold is the first Category 5 severe tropical cyclone to occur in the South Pacific basin since [[Cyclone Gita]] in 2018, and the strongest to affect Vanuatu since [[Cyclone Pam]] in 2015. The seventh named storm of the [[2019\u201320 Australian region cyclone season]], as well as the eighth named storm, fourth severe tropical cyclone, and the strongest tropical cyclone of the [[2019\u201320 South Pacific cyclone season]], Harold is the most intense tropical cyclone and the second major tropical cyclone [[Tropical cyclones in 2020|worldwide in 2020]]. \n\nOn April 1, a tropical low formed centered between the [[Solomon Islands]] and the eastern coast of [[Papua New Guinea]]. The tropical low organised rapidly as it tracked towards the east-southeast over the [[Solomon Sea]], developing tightly curved [[Atmospheric convection|convective]] banding. The BOM later upgraded the tropical low into a Category 1 tropical cyclone, and named it ''Harold'' on the same day. The system moved into the Fiji Meteorological Service's area of responsibility on 2 April and began to explosively intensify by April 3, reaching Category 4 status by April 4 on both scales. The next day, it further strengthened into a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, the highest rating on the Australian scale.\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{storm path|Harold 2020 track.png|left|300px}}\nDuring March&nbsp;30 the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center started to publically monitor a tropical disturbance that had developed along a trough of low pressure about {{convert|440|km|mi|round=5|abbr=on}} to the north-northeast of [[Port Moresby]] in [[Papua New Guinea]].<ref name=\"STWA March 31\">{{cite report|title=Significant Tropical Weather Advisory for the Western and South Pacific Oceans March 31, 2020 00z|publisher=United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center|date=March 31, 2020}}</ref> At this stage, the system was poorly defined and located within a favourable environment for further development with dual-channel outflow, low vertical wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures of {{convert|29|-|30|C|F|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"STWA March 31\"/><ref>{{cite report|title=Significant Tropical Weather Advisory for the Western and South Pacific Oceans March 31, 2020 06z|publisher=United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center|date=March 31, 2020}}</ref> Over the next couple of days, the system moved south-eastward and slowly developed. On April 2, the system rapidly organised and strengthened. Later, the system strengthened into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intenisty scale, and was named Harold. The next day, it moved into the South Pacific.\n\nHarold was a Category&nbsp;1 cyclone on the [[tropical cyclone scales|Australian and Fijian scale]] upon crossing the [[160th meridian east]] into the [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre|area of responsibility]] of the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]] (FMS).<ref>{{cite report|title=Storm Warning Number 4 for Tropical Cyclone Harold |publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |date=April 3, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"WMOFiji\">{{cite web |title=Fiji Meteorological Service |url=https://severeweather.wmo.int/TCFW/13WMO_Workshop2019/02_Fiji.pdf |publisher=World Meteorological Organization |accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref> The storm's strongest winds were located to the north of the low-level centre of circulation.

Harold is the first Category 5 severe tropical cyclone to occur in the South Pacific basin since [[Cyclone Gita]] in 2018, and the strongest to affect Vanuatu since [[Cyclone Pam]] in 2015. The seventh named storm of the [[2019\u201320 Australian region cyclone season]], as well as the eighth named storm, fourth severe tropical cyclone, and the strongest tropical cyclone of the [[2019\u201320 South Pacific cyclone season]], Harold is the most intense tropical cyclone and the second major tropical cyclone [[Tropical cyclones in 2020|worldwide in 2020]]. \n\nOn April 1, a tropical low formed centered between the [[Solomon Islands]] and the eastern coast of [[Papua New Guinea]]. The tropical low organised rapidly as it tracked towards the east-southeast over the [[Solomon Sea]], developing tightly curved [[Atmospheric convection|convective]] banding. The BOM later upgraded the tropical low into a Category 1 tropical cyclone, and named it ''Harold'' on the same day. The system moved into the Fiji Meteorological Service's area of responsibility on 2 April and began to explosively intensify by April 3, reaching Category 4 status by April 4 on both scales. The next day, it further strengthened into a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, the highest rating on the Australian scale.\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{storm path|Harold 2020 track.png|left|300px}}\nDuring March&nbsp;30 the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center started to publically monitor a tropical disturbance that had developed along a trough of low pressure about {{convert|440|km|mi|round=5|abbr=on}} to the north-northeast of [[Port Moresby]] in [[Papua New Guinea]].<ref name=\"STWA March 31\">{{cite report|title=Significant Tropical Weather Advisory for the Western and South Pacific Oceans March 31, 2020 00z|publisher=United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center|date=March 31, 2020}}</ref> At this stage, the system was poorly defined and located within a favourable environment for further development with dual-channel outflow, low vertical wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures of {{convert|29|-|30|C|F|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"STWA March 31\"/><ref>{{cite report|title=Significant Tropical Weather Advisory for the Western and South Pacific Oceans March 31, 2020 06z|publisher=United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center|date=March 31, 2020}}</ref> Over the next couple of days, the system moved south-eastward and slowly developed. On April 2, the system rapidly organised and strengthened. Later, the system strengthened into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intenisty scale, and was named Harold.

They launched the chemicals business Charles Pfizer and Company from a building at the intersection of Harrison Avenue and Bartlett Street<ref name=\"Citycyclopedia\">Kenneth T. Jackson. ''The Encyclopedia of New York City''. The New York Historical Society; Yale University Press; September 1995. P. 895. {{ISBN|978-0-300-05536-8}}</ref> in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]], where they produced an antiparasitic called [[santonin]]. This was an immediate success, although it was the production of citric acid that really kick-started Pfizer's growth in the 1880s. Pfizer continued to buy property to expand its lab and factory on the block bounded by Bartlett Street, Harrison Avenue, Gerry Street, and Flushing Avenue. Pfizer's original administrative headquarters was at 81 Maiden Lane in Manhattan.<ref name=\"Citycyclopedia\"/>\n\nBy 1906, sales totaled $3.4 million.<ref>{{cite web|title=Charles Pfizer|url=http://www.pfizer.com/about/history/charles_pfizer|publisher=Pfizer|accessdate=9 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510151810/http://www.pfizer.com/about/history/charles_pfizer|archivedate=May 10, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nWorld War I caused a shortage of [[calcium citrate]] which Pfizer imported from Italy for the manufacture of citric acid, and the company began a search for an alternative supply. Pfizer chemists learned of a fungus that ferments sugar to citric acid, and they were able to commercialize production of citric acid from this source in 1919, and the company developed expertise in fermentation technology as a result. These skills were applied to the mass production of the antibiotic [[penicillin]] during World War II in response to the need to treat injured Allied soldiers; most of the penicillin that went ashore with the troops on [[D-Day]] was made by Pfizer.<ref name=\"Forbes\">{{cite newsgroup | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnlamattina/2014/07/16/a-plan-for-big-pharma-involvement-in-superbug-rd/ | title=A Plan For Big Pharma Involvement In Superbug R&D | date=2014-07-16 | accessdate=9 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nPenicillin became very inexpensive in the 1940s, and Pfizer searched for new antibiotics with greater profit potential. They discovered [[oxytetracycline|Terramycin (oxytetracycline)]] in 1950, and this changed the company from a manufacturer of fine chemicals to a research-based pharmaceutical company. Pfizer developed a drug discovery program focusing on in vitro synthesis in order to augment its research in fermentation technology. The company also established an animal health division in 1959 with an {{convert|700|acre|km2 |adj=on}} farm and research facility in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]].\n\nBy the 1950s, Pfizer had established offices in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Cuba, Mexico, Panama, Puerto Rico, and the United Kingdom. In 1960, the company moved its medical research laboratory operations out of New York City to a new facility in Groton, Connecticut. In 1980, they launched [[piroxicam|Feldene (piroxicam)]], a prescription anti-inflammatory medication that became Pfizer's first product to reach one billion dollars in total sales.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pfizer Inc: Exploring Our History 1951\u20131999|url=http://www.pfizer.com/about/history/1951-1999|publisher=Pfizer}}</ref> During the 1980s and 1990s, Pfizer Corporation growth was sustained by the discovery and marketing of Zoloft, Lipitor, Norvasc, Zithromax, Aricept, Diflucan, and Viagra.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/1999/07/19/companies/pfizer/|title=Pfizer to pay $20M federal fine; posts 2Q results - Jul. 19, 1999|website=money.cnn.com|access-date=2018-01-28}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Oldani|first=Michael|chapter=Pfizer|date=2016|chapter-url=http://sk.sagepub.com/reference/the-sage-encyclopedia-of-pharmacology-and-society/i8915.xml|pages=1063\u20131066|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|doi=10.4135/9781483349985.n303|access-date=2019-01-21|title=The SAGE Encyclopedia of Pharmacology and Society|isbn=9781483350004}}</ref>\n\n=== 2000\u20132010 ===\nIn this decade, Pfizer grew by mergers, including those with [[Warner\u2013Lambert]] (2000), [[Pharmacia]] (2003), and [[Wyeth]] (2009).\n\nIn 2003, the company acquired [[Esperion Therapeutics]] for $1.3 billion (later selling the unit in 2008), protecting Lipitor from [[ETC-216]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmunos/2015/11/30/pfizer-does-not-need-a-merger-it-needs-a-rebellion/#63d5153e21d6|title=Pfizer Does Not Need A Merger, It Needs A Rebellion|first=Bernard|last=Munos|publisher=|accessdate=May 23, 2017}}</ref> In 2004, Pfizer announced it would acquire Meridica for $125 million.<ref name=\"auto\"/> In 2005, the company made a number of acquisitions: Vicuron Pharmaceuticals for $1.9 billion, Idun for just less than $300 million and finally Angiosyn for $527 million.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nOn June 26, 2006, Pfizer announced it would sell its Consumer Healthcare unit (manufacturer of [[Listerine]], [[Nicorette]], [[Visine]], [[Sudafed]] and Neosporin) to [[Johnson & Johnson]] for $16.6&nbsp;billion.<ref name=\"investor_dec_2006\">{{cite press release| url = http://www.investor.jnj.com/releaseDetail.cfm?releaseid=223093| title = Johnson & Johnson Completes Acquisition Of Pfizer Consumer Healthcare| publisher = [[Johnson & Johnson]]| date = 20 December 2006| access-date = July 12, 2010| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110505022552/http://www.investor.jnj.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=223093| archive-date = May 5, 2011| url-status = dead| df = mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"NYT_dec_2006\">{{cite news|last=Saul|first=Stephanie|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/27/business/johnson-johnson-buys-pfizer-unit-for-166-billion.html|title=Johnson & Johnson Buys Pfizer Unit for $16.6&nbsp;billion|date=27 June 2006|work=The New York Times|accessdate=24 November 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDevelopment of [[torcetrapib]], a drug that increases production of [[high density lipoprotein|HDL]], or \"good cholesterol\", which reduces [[low density lipoprotein|LDL]] thought to be correlated to heart disease, was cancelled in December 2006.

The merger was again driven in part by the desire to acquire full rights to a product, this time Celebrex ([[celecoxib]]), the [[COX-2 selective inhibitor]] previously jointly marketed by [[G. D. Searle & Company|Searle]] (acquired by Pharmacia) and Pfizer. In the ensuing years, Pfizer carried out a massive restructuring that resulted in numerous site closures and the loss of jobs including [[Terre Haute, Indiana|Terre Haute]], Indiana; [[Holland, Michigan|Holland]], Michigan; [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]], Connecticut; [[Brooklyn]], New York; [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]], UK; and [[Puerto Rico]].\n\nPharmacia had been formed by a series of mergers and acquisitions from its predecessors, including Searle, [[Upjohn]] and [[SUGEN]].\n\nSearle was founded in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], in April 1888. The founder was Gideon Daniel Searle. In 1908, the company was incorporated in [[Chicago]], Illinois. In 1941, the company established headquarters in Skokie, Illinois. It was acquired by the [[Monsanto Company]], headquartered in [[St. Louis]], Missouri, in 1985.\n\nThe Upjohn Company was a pharmaceutical manufacturing firm founded in 1886 in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan]], by Dr. [[William E. Upjohn]], an 1875 graduate of the [[University of Michigan]] medical school. The company was originally formed to make friable pills, which were specifically designed to be easily digested.  Greenstone was founded in 1993 by Upjohn as a generics division.<ref name=PT2008/> In 1995, Upjohn merged with Pharmacia, to form [[Pharmacia & Upjohn]]. Pharmacia was created in April 2000 through the merger of Pharmacia & Upjohn with the Monsanto Company and its G.D. Searle unit. The merged company was based in Peapack, New Jersey. The agricultural division was spun off from Pharmacia, as Monsanto, in preparation for the close of the acquisition by Pfizer.<ref name=\"urlPharmacia to Spin Off Monsanto Stake, Less Than 2 Years After Firms Merger Wall Street Journal 28nov01\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mindfully.org/Industry/Monsanto-Pharmacia-SpinOff.htm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130415082118/http://www.mindfully.org/Industry/Monsanto-Pharmacia-SpinOff.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 15, 2013|title=Pharmacia to spin-off Monsanto stake, less than 2 years after firms' merger|work=Wall Street Journal|publisher=mindfully.org|date=November 28, 2001}}</ref>\n\nSUGEN, a company focused on [[protein kinase]] inhibitors, was founded in 1991 in [[Redwood City, California]], and acquired by [[Pharmacia]] in 1999.

After the Pfizer merger, the SUGEN site was shut down in 2003, with the loss of over 300 jobs, and several programs were transferred to Pfizer.

P. 895. {{ISBN|978-0-300-05536-8}}</ref> in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]], where they produced an antiparasitic called [[santonin]]. This was an immediate success, although it was the production of citric acid that really kick-started Pfizer's growth in the 1880s. Pfizer continued to buy property to expand its lab and factory on the block bounded by Bartlett Street, Harrison Avenue, Gerry Street, and Flushing Avenue. Pfizer's original administrative headquarters was at 81 Maiden Lane in Manhattan.<ref name=\"Citycyclopedia\"/>\n\nBy 1906, sales totaled $3.4 million.<ref>{{cite web|title=Charles Pfizer|url=http://www.pfizer.com/about/history/charles_pfizer|publisher=Pfizer|accessdate=9 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510151810/http://www.pfizer.com/about/history/charles_pfizer|archivedate=May 10, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nWorld War I caused a shortage of [[calcium citrate]] which Pfizer imported from Italy for the manufacture of citric acid, and the company began a search for an alternative supply. Pfizer chemists learned of a fungus that ferments sugar to citric acid, and they were able to commercialize production of citric acid from this source in 1919, and the company developed expertise in fermentation technology as a result. These skills were applied to the mass production of the antibiotic [[penicillin]] during World War II in response to the need to treat injured Allied soldiers; most of the penicillin that went ashore with the troops on [[D-Day]] was made by Pfizer.<ref name=\"Forbes\">{{cite newsgroup | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnlamattina/2014/07/16/a-plan-for-big-pharma-involvement-in-superbug-rd/ | title=A Plan For Big Pharma Involvement In Superbug R&D | date=2014-07-16 | accessdate=9 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nPenicillin became very inexpensive in the 1940s, and Pfizer searched for new antibiotics with greater profit potential. They discovered [[oxytetracycline|Terramycin (oxytetracycline)]] in 1950, and this changed the company from a manufacturer of fine chemicals to a research-based pharmaceutical company. Pfizer developed a drug discovery program focusing on in vitro synthesis in order to augment its research in fermentation technology. The company also established an animal health division in 1959 with an {{convert|700|acre|km2 |adj=on}} farm and research facility in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]].\n\nBy the 1950s, Pfizer had established offices in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Cuba, Mexico, Panama, Puerto Rico, and the United Kingdom. In 1960, the company moved its medical research laboratory operations out of New York City to a new facility in Groton, Connecticut. In 1980, they launched [[piroxicam|Feldene (piroxicam)]], a prescription anti-inflammatory medication that became Pfizer's first product to reach one billion dollars in total sales.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pfizer Inc: Exploring Our History 1951\u20131999|url=http://www.pfizer.com/about/history/1951-1999|publisher=Pfizer}}</ref> During the 1980s and 1990s, Pfizer Corporation growth was sustained by the discovery and marketing of Zoloft, Lipitor, Norvasc, Zithromax, Aricept, Diflucan, and Viagra.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/1999/07/19/companies/pfizer/|title=Pfizer to pay $20M federal fine; posts 2Q results - Jul. 19, 1999|website=money.cnn.com|access-date=2018-01-28}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Oldani|first=Michael|chapter=Pfizer|date=2016|chapter-url=http://sk.sagepub.com/reference/the-sage-encyclopedia-of-pharmacology-and-society/i8915.xml|pages=1063\u20131066|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|doi=10.4135/9781483349985.n303|access-date=2019-01-21|title=The SAGE Encyclopedia of Pharmacology and Society|isbn=9781483350004}}</ref>\n\n=== 2000\u20132010 ===\nIn this decade, Pfizer grew by mergers, including those with [[Warner\u2013Lambert]] (2000), [[Pharmacia]] (2003), and [[Wyeth]] (2009).\n\nIn 2003, the company acquired [[Esperion Therapeutics]] for $1.3 billion (later selling the unit in 2008), protecting Lipitor from [[ETC-216]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmunos/2015/11/30/pfizer-does-not-need-a-merger-it-needs-a-rebellion/#63d5153e21d6|title=Pfizer Does Not Need A Merger, It Needs A Rebellion|first=Bernard|last=Munos|publisher=|accessdate=May 23, 2017}}</ref> In 2004, Pfizer announced it would acquire Meridica for $125 million.<ref name=\"auto\"/> In 2005, the company made a number of acquisitions: Vicuron Pharmaceuticals for $1.9 billion, Idun for just less than $300 million and finally Angiosyn for $527 million.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nOn June 26, 2006, Pfizer announced it would sell its Consumer Healthcare unit (manufacturer of [[Listerine]], [[Nicorette]], [[Visine]], [[Sudafed]] and Neosporin) to [[Johnson & Johnson]] for $16.6&nbsp;billion.<ref name=\"investor_dec_2006\">{{cite press release| url = http://www.investor.jnj.com/releaseDetail.cfm?releaseid=223093| title = Johnson & Johnson Completes Acquisition Of Pfizer Consumer Healthcare| publisher = [[Johnson & Johnson]]| date = 20 December 2006| access-date = July 12, 2010| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110505022552/http://www.investor.jnj.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=223093| archive-date = May 5, 2011| url-status = dead| df = mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"NYT_dec_2006\">{{cite news|last=Saul|first=Stephanie|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/27/business/johnson-johnson-buys-pfizer-unit-for-166-billion.html|title=Johnson & Johnson Buys Pfizer Unit for $16.6&nbsp;billion|date=27 June 2006|work=The New York Times|accessdate=24 November 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDevelopment of [[torcetrapib]], a drug that increases production of [[high density lipoprotein|HDL]], or \"good cholesterol\", which reduces [[low density lipoprotein|LDL]] thought to be correlated to heart disease, was cancelled in December 2006.

BYU was originally seeking 15% royalty on sales, which would equate to $9.7 billion. The court filings show that a research agreement was made with [[Monsanto]], whose pharmaceutical business was later acquired by Pfizer, to develop a better aspirin. The enzyme that Dr. Simmons claims to have discovered would induce pain and inflammation while causing gastrointestinal problems, which Celebrex is used to reduce those issues. A battle ensued, lasting over six years, because BYU claimed that Pfizer did not give him credit or compensation while Pfizer claims it had met all obligations regarding the Monsanto agreement. This culminated in a $450 million amicable settlement without going to trial.

It is sometimes called '''grass snake''' or '''green grass snake''', but these names are more commonly applied to the smooth green snake (''[[Opheodrys vernalis]]''). The European [[colubrid]] called [[grass snake]] (''[[Natrix natrix]]'') is unrelated. The rough green snake is docile, often allowing close approach by humans, and seldom bites. Even when bites occur, they have no venom and are harmless.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Rough Green Snake.jpg|thumb|''O. aestivus'', rough green snake|alt=|left|656x656px]]\nThe rough green snake (''Opheodrys aestivus'') is bright green above and has a yellowish belly, affording it excellent camouflage in green vegetation and making them difficult to see in the wild even though they are relatively common in their habitat. It has keeled [[dorsal scales]], which are arranged in 17 rows at mid-body. It grows up to {{convert|116|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} in total length (including tail)<ref>[[Hobart Muir Smith|Smith, H.M.]], and E.D. Brodie Jr. (1982). ''Reptiles of North America: A Guide to Field Identification''. New York: Golden Press. 240 pp. {{ISBN|0-307-13666-3}}. (''Opheodrys aestivus'', pp. 188-189.)</ref> and is very thin.\n\n==Geographic range==\nThe rough green snake ranges throughout the [[Southeastern United States]], from Florida, north to coastal Maine, Indiana, and west to [[Central Texas]]. The snake is commonly found in the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] and [[Atlantic coastal plain]], but is not found in the higher elevations of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. It is also found in northeastern [[Mexico]], including the state of [[Tamaulipas]] and eastern [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]]. <!-- The rough green snake, in recent years has also been sighted in western Africa{{citation needed|reason=Cannot find any sources via Google or what I know from the many Herpers I am a fan of.  Curious if you have confused this with Philthamnus natalensis|date=June 2016}} -->\n\n==Habitat and behavior==\nThe preferred habitat of ''O. aestivus'' is moist meadows and woodlands, often near water. It is highly arboreal, frequently found climbing in low vegetation, and is also a good swimmer. However, it is often found on the ground as well. Unlike many snakes, it is largely [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]].\n\n==Diet==\nThe diet of ''O. aestivus'' consists mostly of [[insect]]s and other terrestrial [[arthropod]]s, but some snails and tree frogs are eaten as well. This snake is not a constrictor; most prey are grabbed and simply swallowed alive.\n\n[[File:Rough green snake in web.jpg|thumb|''O. aestivus'', rough green snake, spotted in [[St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana]] caught in the web of a [[Golden silk orb-weaver]]]]\n\n==Predation==\nPredators of the rough green snake include birds <!-- really?spiders, -->and other snakes, such as the eastern racer (''[[Coluber constrictor]]'') and the eastern king snake (''[[Lampropeltis getula]]'').\n\n==Reproduction==\nThe rough green snake breeds in spring, and sometimes again in fall. Females lay 2-14 eggs, occasionally in a communal nest shared by more than one female. Up to 75 eggs have been found in one such nest. The nest site varies: under boards, under bark in rotting stumps, in deep mulch, or under a rock. Hatchlings from spring breeding typically emerge in August or September, and each is about {{convert|18|\u2013|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} in total length.\n\n==Conservation status==\nThe rough green snake is widespread and is not of [[Conservation biology|conservation]] concern, in general. However, urban development, especially the reduction of vegetation near waterways, may reduce their numbers. Many are [[Roadkill|killed on roads]], and they may be susceptible to poisoning by pesticides used on their [[insect]] prey. When dead, they turn blue. It is also one of the most exploited pet snakes in North America. ''O. aestivus'' are collected by the hundreds each year and wholesale for around eight dollars in U.S. currency making it a very accessible species to pet shops and later to the pet owner.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Subspecies==\n*''Opheodrys aestivus aestivus'' {{small|([[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], 1766)}} \u2013 northern rough green snake\n*''Opheodrys aestivus carinatus'' {{small|[[Arnold B.

It is sometimes called '''grass snake''' or '''green grass snake''', but these names are more commonly applied to the smooth green snake (''[[Opheodrys vernalis]]''). The European [[colubrid]] called [[grass snake]] (''[[Natrix natrix]]'') is unrelated. The rough green snake is docile, often allowing close approach by humans, and seldom bites. Even when bites occur, they have no venom and are harmless.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Rough Green Snake.jpg|thumb|''O. aestivus'', rough green snake]]\nThe rough green snake (''Opheodrys aestivus'') is bright green above and has a yellowish belly, affording it excellent camouflage in green vegetation and making them difficult to see in the wild even though they are relatively common in their habitat. It has keeled [[dorsal scales]], which are arranged in 17 rows at mid-body. It grows up to {{convert|116|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} in total length (including tail)<ref>[[Hobart Muir Smith|Smith, H.M.]], and E.D. Brodie Jr. (1982). ''Reptiles of North America: A Guide to Field Identification''. New York: Golden Press. 240 pp. {{ISBN|0-307-13666-3}}. (''Opheodrys aestivus'', pp. 188-189.)</ref> and is very thin.\n\n==Geographic range==\nThe rough green snake ranges throughout the [[Southeastern United States]], from Florida, north to coastal Maine, Indiana, and west to [[Central Texas]]. The snake is commonly found in the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] and [[Atlantic coastal plain]], but is not found in the higher elevations of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. It is also found in northeastern [[Mexico]], including the state of [[Tamaulipas]] and eastern [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]]. <!-- The rough green snake, in recent years has also been sighted in western Africa{{citation needed|reason=Cannot find any sources via Google or what I know from the many Herpers I am a fan of.  Curious if you have confused this with Philthamnus natalensis|date=June 2016}} -->\n\n==Habitat and behavior==\nThe preferred habitat of ''O. aestivus'' is moist meadows and woodlands, often near water. It is highly arboreal, frequently found climbing in low vegetation, and is also a good swimmer. However, it is often found on the ground as well. Unlike many snakes, it is largely [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]].\n\n==Diet==\nThe diet of ''O. aestivus'' consists mostly of [[insect]]s and other terrestrial [[arthropod]]s, but some snails and tree frogs are eaten as well. This snake is not a constrictor; most prey are grabbed and simply swallowed alive.\n\n[[File:Rough green snake in web.jpg|thumb|''O. aestivus'', rough green snake, spotted in [[St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana]] caught in the web of a [[Golden silk orb-weaver]]]]\n\n==Predation==\nPredators of the rough green snake include birds <!-- really?spiders, -->and other snakes, such as the eastern racer (''[[Coluber constrictor]]'') and the eastern king snake (''[[Lampropeltis getula]]'').\n\n==Reproduction==\nThe rough green snake breeds in spring, and sometimes again in fall. Females lay 2-14 eggs, occasionally in a communal nest shared by more than one female. Up to 75 eggs have been found in one such nest. The nest site varies: under boards, under bark in rotting stumps, in deep mulch, or under a rock. Hatchlings from spring breeding typically emerge in August or September, and each is about {{convert|18|\u2013|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} in total length.\n\n==Conservation status==\nThe rough green snake is widespread and is not of [[Conservation biology|conservation]] concern, in general. However, urban development, especially the reduction of vegetation near waterways, may reduce their numbers. Many are [[Roadkill|killed on roads]], and they may be susceptible to poisoning by pesticides used on their [[insect]] prey. When dead, they turn blue. It is also one of the most exploited pet snakes in North America. ''O. aestivus'' are collected by the hundreds each year and wholesale for around eight dollars in U.S. currency making it a very accessible species to pet shops and later to the pet owner.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Subspecies==\n*''Opheodrys aestivus aestivus'' {{small|([[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], 1766)}} \u2013 northern rough green snake\n*''Opheodrys aestivus carinatus'' {{small|[[Arnold B.

The game debuted in Japan at the 2001 Amusement Operators Union trade show as '''''Monkey Ball''''',{{efn|{{Nihongo|''Monkey Ball''|\u30e2\u30f3\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb|Monk\u012b B\u014dru|lead=yes}}}} an [[arcade game|arcade]] cabinet running on Sega's [[List of Sega arcade system boards#Sega NAOMI series|NAOMI]] hardware and controlled with a distinctive banana-shaped analog stick. Due to the failure of Sega's [[Dreamcast]] home console and the company's subsequent restructuring, an enhanced port dubbed ''Super Monkey Ball'' was released as a [[Launch game|launch title]] for the [[GameCube]] in late 2001, garnering interest as Sega's first game published for a [[Nintendo]] home console.\n\nConceived by Amusement Vision head [[Toshihiro Nagoshi]], ''Super Monkey Ball'' involves guiding a transparent ball containing one of four monkeys\u2014AiAi, MeeMee, Baby, and GonGon\u2014across a series of maze-like platforms. The player must reach the goal without falling off or letting the timer reach zero to advance to the next stage. There are also several [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] modes: independent [[minigame]]s as well as extensions of the main [[single-player video game|single-player]] game.\n\n''Super Monkey Ball'' received highly positive reviews from critics, who praised the simplicity and subtle depth of its control scheme as well as the new multiplayer modes not present in its arcade counterpart, although some felt its presentation was lacking. The game was commercially successful and remained one of Sega's best-sellers in the United States for much of 2002, eventually spawning a direct sequel, ''[[Super Monkey Ball 2]]'', and an entire ''[[Super Monkey Ball]]'' franchise.\n\n== Modes ==\n''Super Monkey Ball'' has three game modes: main game, party games, and mini-games. The mini-games are unavailable at first, and must be unlocked by earning 2,500 \"play points\" through playing the main game in single-player mode.<ref>{{cite document|title=''Super Monkey Ball'' Instruction Booklet|publisher=Sega Corporation|year=2001|pages=3, 7\u20138}}</ref><ref name=\"GameSpy\" /><ref name=\"IGN\" /><ref name=\"Edge\" />\n\n=== Main game ===\n[[File:Super Monkey Ball screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|The player about to start a stage during the main game.]]\nReminiscent of ''[[Marble Madness]]'' and ''[[Labyrinth (marble game)|Labyrinth]]'', the objective of the main game is to guide one of four playable [[monkey]]s (AiAi, MeeMee, Baby, and GonGon) encased in a [[hamster ball|transparent ball]] across a suspended series of platforms and through a goal.<ref name=\"GameSpy\" /><ref name=\"IGN\" /><ref name=\"Page 4\">{{cite document|title=''Super Monkey Ball'' Instruction Booklet|publisher=Sega Corporation|year=2001|page=4}}</ref> By moving the [[analog stick]], the player tilts the entire set of platforms that make up a level, called a ''floor'', and the ball rolls accordingly.<ref name=\"GameSpy\" /><ref name=\"IGN\" /><ref>{{cite document|title=''Super Monkey Ball'' Instruction Booklet|publisher=Sega Corporation|year=2001|pages=4\u20135}}</ref> If the ball falls off a floor (an event dubbed a ''fall out'') or the in-game timer reaches zero, the player loses one of their three lives.<ref name=\"Page 4\" /> The speed, in [[miles per hour]], at which the ball is moving is displayed in the corner of the screen.<ref>{{cite document|title=''Super Monkey Ball'' Instruction Booklet|publisher=Sega Corporation|year=2001|page=10}}</ref> Pausing the game and selecting the \"View Stage\" option allows one to rotate the camera around and examine the floor.<ref>{{cite document|title=''Super Monkey Ball'' Instruction Booklet|publisher=Sega Corporation|year=2001|page=14}}</ref> A replay is presented after a floor's goal has been reached; replays can be saved to a memory card and viewed at whim.<ref>{{cite document|title=''Super Monkey Ball'' Instruction Booklet|publisher=Sega Corporation|year=2001|pages=14\u201315}}</ref> Every second remaining on the timer when a floor is completed adds 100 points to the player's [[Score (game)|score]].

The monkey's ball opens on command to resemble a pair of wings, allowing it to fly. The monkey's trajectory is manipulated with the analog stick. Wind direction and strength, altitude, and speed (in addition to random hazards selected by an optional \"Wheel of Danger\" feature before each flight) impact the player's ability to land the monkey on one of several [[Darts|dartboard]]-like targets in the middle of the ocean. Bananas collected while airborne enable the use of items in later rounds that can eliminate wind resistance, control the ball's roll, multiply the player's score, or ensure a sticky landing.<ref name=\"GameSpot\" /><ref>{{cite document|title=''Super Monkey Ball'' Instruction Booklet|publisher=Sega Corporation|year=2001|pages=25\u201329}}</ref>\n\n=== Mini-games ===\nThe mini-games are based on real sporting activities, but with the player's ball containing their monkey.<ref name=\"GameSpy\" /> The following mini-games are available, once unlocked through the earning of play points:<ref name=\"Edge\" />\n*'''Monkey [[Pool (cue sports)|Billiards]]''': One to two players take turns competing in a game of [[nine-ball]].

The game debuted in Japan at the 2001 Amusement Operators Union trade show as '''''Monkey Ball''''',{{efn|{{Nihongo|''Monkey Ball''|\u30e2\u30f3\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb|Monk\u012b B\u014dru|lead=yes}}}} an [[arcade game|arcade]] cabinet running on Sega's [[List of Sega arcade system boards#Sega NAOMI series|NAOMI]] hardware and controlled with a distinctive banana-shaped analog stick. Due to the failure of Sega's [[Dreamcast]] home console and the company's subsequent restructuring, an enhanced port dubbed ''Super Monkey Ball'' was released as a [[Launch game|launch title]] for the [[GameCube]] in late 2001, garnering interest as Sega's first game published for a [[Nintendo]] home console.\n\nConceived by Amusement Vision head [[Toshihiro Nagoshi]], ''Super Monkey Ball'' involves guiding a transparent ball containing one of four monkeys\u2014AiAi, MeeMee, Baby, and GonGon\u2014across a series of maze-like platforms. The player must reach the goal without falling off or letting the timer reach zero to advance to the next stage. There are also several [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] modes: independent [[minigame]]s as well as extensions of the main [[single-player video game|single-player]] game.\n\n''Super Monkey Ball'' received highly positive reviews from critics, who praised the simplicity and subtle depth of its control scheme as well as the new multiplayer modes not present in its arcade counterpart, although some felt its presentation was lacking. The game was commercially successful and remained one of Sega's best-sellers in the United States for much of 2002, eventually spawning a direct sequel, ''[[Super Monkey Ball 2]]'', and an entire ''[[Super Monkey Ball]]'' franchise.\n\n== Modes ==\n''Super Monkey Ball'' has three game modes: main game, party games, and mini-games. The mini-games are unavailable at first, and must be unlocked by earning 2,500 \"play points\" through playing the main game in single-player mode.<ref>{{cite document|title=''Super Monkey Ball'' Instruction Booklet|publisher=Sega Corporation|year=2001|pages=3, 7\u20138}}</ref><ref name=\"GameSpy\" /><ref name=\"IGN\" /><ref name=\"Edge\" />\n\n=== Main game ===\n[[File:Super Monkey Ball screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|The player about to start a stage during the main game.]]\nReminiscent of ''[[Marble Madness]]'' and ''[[Labyrinth (marble game)|Labyrinth]]'', the objective of the main game is to guide one of four playable [[monkey]]s (AiAi, MeeMee, Baby, and GonGon) encased in a [[hamster ball|transparent ball]] across a suspended series of platforms and through a goal.<ref name=\"GameSpy\" /><ref name=\"IGN\" /><ref name=\"Page 4\">{{cite document|title=''Super Monkey Ball'' Instruction Booklet|publisher=Sega Corporation|year=2001|page=4}}</ref> By moving the [[analog stick]], the player tilts the entire set of platforms that make up a level, called a ''floor'', and the ball rolls accordingly.<ref name=\"GameSpy\" /><ref name=\"IGN\" /><ref>{{cite document|title=''Super Monkey Ball'' Instruction Booklet|publisher=Sega Corporation|year=2001|pages=4\u20135}}</ref> If the ball falls off a floor (an event dubbed a ''fall out'') or the in-game timer reaches zero, the player loses one of their three lives.<ref name=\"Page 4\" /> The speed, in [[miles per hour]], at which the ball is moving is displayed in the corner of the screen.<ref>{{cite document|title=''Super Monkey Ball'' Instruction Booklet|publisher=Sega Corporation|year=2001|page=10}}</ref> Pausing the game and selecting the \"View Stage\" option allows one to rotate the camera around and examine the floor.<ref>{{cite document|title=''Super Monkey Ball'' Instruction Booklet|publisher=Sega Corporation|year=2001|page=14}}</ref> A replay is presented after a floor's goal has been reached; replays can be saved to a memory card and viewed at whim.<ref>{{cite document|title=''Super Monkey Ball'' Instruction Booklet|publisher=Sega Corporation|year=2001|pages=14\u201315}}</ref> Every second remaining on the timer when a floor is completed adds 100 points to the player's [[Score (game)|score]].

The monkey's ball opens on command to resemble a pair of wings, allowing it to fly. The monkey's trajectory is manipulated with the analog stick. Wind direction and strength, altitude, and speed (in addition to random hazards selected by an optional \"Wheel of Danger\" feature before each flight) impact the player's ability to land the monkey on one of several [[Darts|dartboard]]-like targets in the middle of the ocean.
