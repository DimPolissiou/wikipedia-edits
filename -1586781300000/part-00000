It was used as a \"gap filler\", looking for aircraft attempting to sneak by the DEW line by flying between the main [[AN/FPS-19]] stations at low altitude. It could detect aircraft flying at 200 feet over land or 50 feet over water.{{sfn|Ray|1965|p=24}} The system was known as '''Fluttar''' during its development at the [[Lincoln Laboratory]], and this name was widely used. It was also sometimes known as \"Type F\".\n\n==MCL==\n{{main|Mid-Canada Line}}\nIn the early 1950s, [[Canada]] undertook the development of a pioneering radar system as part of the [[Mid-Canada Line]] (MCL). This system was based on [[continuous wave radar]]s that broadcast a signal between separate transmitter and receiver stations. When an aircraft passed through the space between the stations, some of the signal was reflected off the aircraft and back to the receiver.{{sfn|Skolnik|2007|p=37}}\n\nBecause the beam was not steered, unlike a conventional scanning radar, the antennas did not move and the physical design was greatly simplified. Additionally, as the signal was continuous, not pulsed, the transmitter was simpler and cheaper. The original idea had been to mount the systems on telephone poles over relatively short distances, but the need to build thousands of such systems led to this idea being abandoned. So the telephone poles were replaced with tall towers, the distance between them increased from a few miles to about {{convert|90|km}}, and a string of stations was constructed across Canada.{{sfn|Skolnik|2007|p=37}}\n\nUnlike a pulse radar where the signal from the station travels out and back, in a forward scatter [[bistatic radar]] like the MCL, it travels an almost straight line from the transmitter to receiver. For this reason, the forward scatter signal is subject only to one [[inverse square law]] reduction in power, compared to the normal [[radar equation]] where power drops with the fourth root of range. Thus with small targets, a pulse radar will only see them near to the station, whereas a forward scatter system will see them over a much greater area.{{sfn|Skolnik|2007|p=37}}\n\nOriginally this was seen as a major advantage of the concept, allowing it to cover long ranges using much less power. But when the first experimental versions of the MCL stations were set up, a problem was immediately noticed. Birds, normally only seen as [[radar angels]] at short range, if at all, could now be seen at long distances from the station. During migration, the system was completely swamped with returns that rendered it essentially useless.{{sfn|Skolnik|2007|p=37}}\n\n==Gap fillter==\nThe same basic concept was perfectly suited to fill the gaps between the DEW line stations. Because the radars were very simple, they could be run unattended, forwarding data to the main stations. Desiring better low-altitude coverage, the new system would be spaced about {{convert|25|mi}} apart, so a string of three towers would be built between the main stations.{{sfn|Skolnik|2007|p=37}}\n\nBut some solution would be needed for the bird problem. The first attempt was made by the [[Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory]], who surmised that using lower frequencies in the [[VHF]] range might mitigate the problem due to the lower [[Rayleigh scattering]] cross-section as the [[wavelength]] would be much greater than a bird. Tests showed that the large birds seen in the arctic made perfectly good reflectors even at these frequencies.{{sfn|Skolnik|2007|p=38}}\n\n==Fluttar==\nDevelopment of another solution began at the MIT-backed [[Lincoln Laboratory]]. Although similar to the MCL in layout, it worked along different principles. Instead of the signal being scattered along the line between the two stations, the antennas were aimed about 15 degrees \"forward\" of the line between the two stations. When an aircraft entered the area, it would scatter back to the receiver as before, but in this case the aircraft's motion would shift the frequency of the signal. This effect had first been noticed in [[television]] signals when aircraft flew overhead, which is where it gained the name \"flutter\" for the way the image shifted back and forth on the screen.{{sfn|Skolnik|2007|p=37}}\n\nBecause the system receieved a signal that was not the original frequency, by comparing the original to the received signal, the Doppler shift could be measured, and this revealed the speed of the target. This allowed it to filter out any slow-moving targets, like birds.{{sfn|Skolnik|2007|p=39}} The system was set to filter out anything under {{convert|125|mph}}.{{sfn|Ray|1965|p=24}} Another advantage of Fluttar over MCL was that by using multiple Doppler filters in the receiver, the approximate velocity and direction (north or south) could be determined.\n\n== AN/FPS-23==\nFluttar was an inexpensive system compared to the main DEW radars. It used a 1 kilowatt, continuous wave, klystron amplifier as a source, and as this was not pulsed, much simpler high-voltage circuitry was needed. It could operate anywhere from 475 to 525&nbsp;[[Hertz|MHz]]. Towers were separated anywhere from {{convert|40|to(-)|70|miles}} and were {{convert|100|to(-)|400|feet}} tall, depending on the local terrain.{{sfn|Ray|1965|p=24}}  The main DEW stations were normally about {{convert|100|miles}} apart, so typically the AN/FPT-4 transmitter was placed in the middle, with the AN/FPR-2 receivers at the stations on either side.\n\nThe AN/FPS-23 stations became active in 1957, but soon discovered problems of its own. Annoyingly, although birds flying between the stations were indeed filtered out, it turned out that birds liked to congregate in warm locations, like the Diesel generators at the stations. The signal was so strong that it overwhelmed the filters. A more annoying problem turned out to be the aircraft that flew from station to station for maintenance, which invariably triggered the system. Designed for the very low probability of detection, the system was designed to ring alarms when anything was detected in order to avoid bored operators missing the signal. Instead, it triggered continually and rendered the system ineffective.{{sfn|Skolnik|2007|p=45}}\n\nIt was declared obsolete in 1963, and the intermediate stations were closed.\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{AFHRA}}\n* {{cite web\n |url=http://www.radomes.org/museum/equip.php\n |title=USAF Air Defense Radar Equipment\n |ref=CITEREFUSAF\n}}\n* {{cite techreport\n |url=https://www.northcom.mil/Portals/28/Paper%20No%2031%20A%20History%20of%20the%20Dew%20Line,%201946-1964%20Full%20Release.pdf?ver=2017-03-16-115749-817\n |title=A History of the DEW Line 1964 - 1964\n |first=Thomas |last=Ray\n |publisher=Air Force Historical Research Agency\n |date=June 1965\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite techreport\n |url=https://www.northcom.mil/Portals/28/Paper%20No%2031%20A%20History%20of%20the%20Dew%20Line,%201946-1964%20Full%20Release.pdf?ver=2017-03-16-115749-817\n |title=A History of the DEW Line 1964 - 1964\n |first=Thomas |last=Ray\n |publisher=Air Force Historical Research Agency\n |date=June 1965\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite encyclopedia\n |editor1-first= Nicholas |editor1-last=Willis |editor2-first= Hugh |editor2-last=Griffiths\n |encyclopedia = Advances in Bistatic Radar\n |title=Fluttar DEW-Line Gap-Filler\n |first=Merrill |last=Skolnik\n |pages=35-46\n |publisher=SciTech Publishing\n |date=2007\n |ref=harv\n}}\n\n==External links==\n\n{{AN/FPS}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:AN FPS-23}}\n[[Category:Ground radars]]\n[[Category:Bistatic radars]]\n\n\n{{USAF-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox radar\n|name      =   AN/FPS-23\n|image     =   <!--without [[Image:...]] syntax-->\n|caption   =  \n|manufacturer =  Motorola\n|country   =   United States\n|introdate = \n|number    =   \n|type      =   [[early warning radar]]\n|frequency =   475 - 525 MHz ([[Ultra high frequency|UHF]])\n|PRF       =   \n|beamwidth =   <!--X\u00b0 (horizontal), X\u00b0 (vertical)-->\n|pulsewidth=   \n|RPM       =   \n|range     =   {{convert|50|nmi|km}}\n|altitude  =   <!--{{m to ft|X|addr=yes}}-->\n|diameter  =   {{convert|20|by|6|feet}}\n|azimuth   =   <!--X-Y\u00ba-->\n|elevation =   <!--X-Y\u00ba-->\n|precision =   \n|power     =   1 kW\n|other names= Fluttar\n}}\nThe [[Motorola]] '''AN/FPS-23''' was a short-range [[early warning radar]] deployed on the [[Distant Early Warning Line]] (DEW Line).

It was a significant stylistic departure for the band, with complex synthesised arrangements and less prominent guitar.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/outside-the-gate-mw0000201758|title=''Outside the Gate'' [review]|website=Allmusic|accessdate=23 January 2019}}</ref> The [[lead single]] was \"[[America (Killing Joke song)|America]]\".

Discogs. Retrieved 2 May 2019</ref>\n\n== Production ==\nInterviews with members of Killing Joke have retrospectively suggested ''Outside The Gate'' began as a solo project by Jaz Coleman with guitarist Geordie Walker, until E.G. Records insisted the album be released as a Killing Joke album.<ref name=loud /> Killing Joke bassist Paul Raven and drummer Paul Ferguson were asked to perform on the album but not allowed to participate in its writing or production, leading to tension and acrimony during recording.<ref name=loud>{{cite web |url=https://louderthanwar.com/big-paul-ferguson-interview/|title=Interview: Big Paul Ferguson from Killing Joke|last=Rahman The Writer |website=[[Louder Than War (website)|Louder Than War]]|date=6 October 2016|accessdate=26 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nFerguson initially recorded drums in sessions produced by Geordie with Jaz absent. As Ferguson later recounted, the synthesisers and click track were were muted for him to record drums to the guitar. The two reportedly liked these results, until the synthesisers were unmuted and the drumming style no longer suited.<ref name=\"2004 Interview With Paul Ferguson\">{{cite web |first1=Alex |title=Interview with Big Paul Ferguson, September 4, 2004 |url=https://vassifer.blogs.com/alexinnyc/2006/03/interview_with_.html |website=Flaming Pablum |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"2016 Paul Ferguson Interview\">{{cite web |first1=Rahman |title=Interview: Big Paul Ferguson from Killing Joke |url=https://louderthanwar.com/big-paul-ferguson-interview/ |website=Louder Than War |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref> Jaz Coleman asked that Ferguson be replaced, bringing in session player [[Jimmy Copley]] and percussionist Jeff Scantlebury, later claiming that Ferguson wasn't able to manage the precise timings needed. Similarly, Paul Raven asked for his name to be removed from the album credits, purportedly quitting the recording sessions and calling Coleman and Walker \"a pair of ego-strokers\".<ref name=\"Mat\">{{cite work |first=Mat |last=Smith |title=Killing Joke [Paul Raven interview] |work=Melody Maker |date=14 May 1988}}</ref>\n\nA picture collage of Coleman and Walker appears on the album sleeve and the pair promoted the album with no other band members. In an interview for [[MTV]] in the UK, in May 1988, the pair stated their intention to support ''Outside the Gate'' with a tour. Coleman also stated of the album's new style that they \"wanted a more articulate funky powerful rhythm\" and that \"as long as [he is] alive and as long as Geordie is alive, Killing Joke is alive.\"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukAWRDrIQFQ \"Killing Joke interview -Coleman and Walker on MTV\"].

It was a significant stylistic departure for the band, with complex synthesised arrangements and less prominent guitar.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/outside-the-gate-mw0000201758|title=''Outside the Gate'' [review]|website=Allmusic|accessdate=23 January 2019}}</ref> The [[lead single]] was \"[[America (Killing Joke song)|America]]\".

Similarly, Paul Raven asked for his name to be removed from the album credits, purportedly quitting the recording sessions and calling Coleman and Walker \"a pair of ego-strokers\".<ref name=\"Mat\">{{cite work |first=Mat |last=Smith |title=Killing Joke [Paul Raven interview] |work=Melody Maker |date=14 May 1988}}</ref>\n\nA picture collage of Coleman and Walker appears on the album sleeve and the pair promoted the album with no other band members. In an interview for [[MTV]] in the UK, in May 1988, the pair stated their intention to support ''Outside the Gate'' with a tour. Coleman also stated of the album's new style that they \"wanted a more articulate funky powerful rhythm\" and that \"as long as [he is] alive and as long as Geordie is alive, Killing Joke is alive.\"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukAWRDrIQFQ \"Killing Joke interview -Coleman and Walker on MTV\"].

Sonu ([[Kartik Aaryan]]), his best friend, tells him that she is not meant for him, as Titu is loving and caring while Pihu is possessive and callous. Sonu gives an ultimatum to Titu to choose between Pihu and him and Titu chooses his best friend. Six months after his breakup, Titu's family tells him that a family has shown interest in getting him married to their daughter Sweety ([[Nushrat Bharucha]]). He agrees to meet Sweety and they instantly hit it off. Sweety is extremely caring, sensitive, and clever and is seemingly the 'ideal partner'. Sonu finds this very fishy, though he admits to Titu that she seems nice but he can't really say whether or not the two should marry just yet.\n\nHe later finds out that Sweety was in fact going to marry another man named Rahul but that did not work out as she became dominating, possessive, and once even got drunk and created a scene in Goa. He reveals this to the family, who question Sweety regarding the same and she tells her version of the story in which she does not seem to be at fault. Titu tells Sonu that she had told him all of this in the first meeting itself and he did not want the family to know about all of this. On the night of the engagement, Sonu begins warming up to the idea of Titu and Sweety's wedding. However, Sweety reveals that she in fact is a gold digger and challenges him that she will throw him out of Titu's life and home very soon. Sonu confides in his grandfathers Ghasitaram and Lalu about the revelation. They bet between themselves to see if Sonu can save Titu from Sweety.\n\nTitu is now engaged to Sweety and this brings a lot of compromises for Sonu who was earlier used to living a bachelor's life. Sweety changes their care-taker, she walks in on Sonu making out with a girl. She also manipulates the family members and Titu into buying and naming a house after her and Titu. She turns the house into a vegetarian household and controls Ghasitaram by threatening to reveal his dirty lies to Dadi. Sonu foresees Titu's imminent downfall and to protect him he plans a bachelor party for Titu at Amsterdam, where he arranges his ex-girlfriend Pihu to \"accidentally\" run into them after convincing her that Titu is still in love with her and he wants to help them get back together. They return to India along with Pihu and Sonu is happy to see a bothered Sweety after witnessing the growing closeness between Titu and Pihu. But Sweety reveals the truth to Pihu that it was in fact Sonu who broke Titu and Pihu up in the first place and that Sonu is using her. At this point, Titu is visibly angry with Sonu.\n\nHe once again confides with Ghasitaram and Lalu and they volunteer to sort the situation but Sonu interjects saying his best friend should decide for himself. Sonu helps prepare for the wedding, dances in the Baraat but during the garland ceremony, he makes a final attempt and gives Titu the ultimatum again: 'Whether she is honest or I am dishonest, it's either her or me', and walks away from the wedding, crying. Sweety attempts to turn the tide but Titu, in a fit of epiphany, reveals to Sweety that Sonu's tears reveal that he is a lot more to Titu and firmly announces that if it is between Sonu or her, it will always be his best friend. The scene switches to Sweety standing in the mandap and coming to terms that her malicious tactics cannot always work.\n\nAfter the narrow escape, Sonu, Titu, Ghasitaram, and Lalu are seen sitting and drinking by the pool, whilst Sonu discusses his own marriage plans, to the disgust of others.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kartik Aaryan]] as Sonu Sharma\n* [[Sunny Singh (actor)|Sunny Singh]] as Titu Sharma\n* [[Neha Kashyap]] as Sweety Sharma\n* [[Ishita Raj Sharma]] as Pihu Gaitonde\n* [[Alok Nath]] as Ghasitaram Sharma\n* [[Virendra Saxena]] as Lalu Kaka, Ghasitaram's best friend\n* Madhumalti Kapoor as Sushmita Devi Sharma, Titu's grandma\n* Ayesha Raza Mishra as Maya Sharma, Titu's mom\n* [[Pawan Chopra]] as Dharmendra Kumar Sharma, Titu's father\n* [[Deepika Amin]] as Renu Sharma, Sweety's mom\n* [[Rajesh Jais]] as Arjun Sharma, Sweety's father\n* [[Sonnalli Seygall]] as Sonu's girlfriend (Cameo Appearance)\n* Collins Twins in song \"Bom Diggy\"\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nLuv Ranjan made the announcement about the film through his official [[Twitter]] account on 6 December 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/luv_ranjan/status/795521914844299265 |title=Official Announcement \u2013 SKTKS |via=[[Twitter]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Luv-Ranjan-teams-up-with-Bhushan-Kumar-for-a-romcom/articleshow/55263070.cms |title=Luv Ranjan teams up with Bhushan Kumar for a romcom |work=[[The Times of India]]}}</ref> The shooting for the film began on 12 December 2016<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/taran_adarsh/status/808275559499190272 |title=Luv Ranjan's new film launched |via=[[Twitter]]}}</ref> while the title of the film was officially announced by Kartik Aaryan, Nushrat Bharucha and Sunny Singh through a [[YouTube]] video on 16 June 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wfk8Y3ULKOk |title=Title Announcement Video \u2013 Luv Ranjan \u2013 Kartik Aaryan, Nushrat Bharucha, Sunny Singh,Saurav Singh |via=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> The official trailer of the film was launched on 20 December 2017.<ref name=\"OT\" />\n\n{{cquote|\u201cIn India, they say that marriage happens between two families.

Sonu ([[Kartik Aaryan]]), his best friend, tells him that she is not meant for him, as Titu is loving and caring while Pihu is possessive and callous. Sonu gives an ultimatum to Titu to choose between Pihu and him and Titu chooses his best friend. Six months after his breakup, Titu's family tells him that a family has shown interest in getting him married to their daughter Sweety ([[Nushrat Bharucha]]). He agrees to meet Sweety and they instantly hit it off. Sweety is extremely caring, sensitive, and clever and is seemingly the 'ideal partner'. Sonu finds this very fishy, though he admits to Titu that she seems nice but he can't really say whether or not the two should marry just yet.\n\nHe later finds out that Sweety was in fact going to marry another man named Rahul but that did not work out as she became dominating, possessive, and once even got drunk and created a scene in Goa. He reveals this to the family, who question Sweety regarding the same and she tells her version of the story in which she does not seem to be at fault. Titu tells Sonu that she had told him all of this in the first meeting itself and he did not want the family to know about all of this. On the night of the engagement, Sonu begins warming up to the idea of Titu and Sweety's wedding. However, Sweety reveals that she in fact is a gold digger and challenges him that she will throw him out of Titu's life and home very soon. Sonu confides in his grandfathers Ghasitaram and Lalu about the revelation. They bet between themselves to see if Sonu can save Titu from Sweety.\n\nTitu is now engaged to Sweety and this brings a lot of compromises for Sonu who was earlier used to living a bachelor's life. Sweety changes their care-taker, she walks in on Sonu making out with a girl. She also manipulates the family members and Titu into buying and naming a house after her and Titu. She turns the house into a vegetarian household and controls Ghasitaram by threatening to reveal his dirty lies to Dadi. Sonu foresees Titu's imminent downfall and to protect him he plans a bachelor party for Titu at Amsterdam, where he arranges his ex-girlfriend Pihu to \"accidentally\" run into them after convincing her that Titu is still in love with her and he wants to help them get back together. They return to India along with Pihu and Sonu is happy to see a bothered Sweety after witnessing the growing closeness between Titu and Pihu. But Sweety reveals the truth to Pihu that it was in fact Sonu who broke Titu and Pihu up in the first place and that Sonu is using her. At this point, Titu is visibly angry with Sonu.\n\nHe once again confides with Ghasitaram and Lalu and they volunteer to sort the situation but Sonu interjects saying his best friend should decide for himself. Sonu helps prepare for the wedding, dances in the Baraat but during the garland ceremony, he makes a final attempt and gives Titu the ultimatum again: 'Whether she is honest or I am dishonest, it's either her or me', and walks away from the wedding, crying. Sweety attempts to turn the tide but Titu, in a fit of epiphany, reveals to Sweety that Sonu's tears reveal that he is a lot more to Titu and firmly announces that if it is between Sonu or her, it will always be his best friend. The scene switches to Sweety standing in the mandap and coming to terms that her malicious tactics cannot always work.\n\nAfter the narrow escape, Sonu, Titu, Ghasitaram, and Lalu are seen sitting and drinking by the pool, whilst Sonu discusses his own marriage plans, to the disgust of others.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kartik Aaryan]] as Sonu Sharma\n* [[Sunny Singh (actor)|Sunny Singh]] as Titu Sharma\n* [[Nushrat Bharucha]] as Sweety Sharma\n* [[Ishita Raj Sharma]] as Pihu Gaitonde\n* [[Alok Nath]] as Ghasitaram Sharma\n* [[Virendra Saxena]] as Lalu Kaka, Ghasitaram's best friend\n* Madhumalti Kapoor as Sushmita Devi Sharma, Titu's grandma\n* Ayesha Raza Mishra as Maya Sharma, Titu's mom\n* [[Pawan Chopra]] as Dharmendra Kumar Sharma, Titu's father\n* [[Deepika Amin]] as Renu Sharma, Sweety's mom\n* [[Rajesh Jais]] as Arjun Sharma, Sweety's father\n* [[Sonnalli Seygall]] as Sonu's girlfriend (Cameo Appearance)\n* Collins Twins in song \"Bom Diggy\"\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nLuv Ranjan made the announcement about the film through his official [[Twitter]] account on 6 December 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/luv_ranjan/status/795521914844299265 |title=Official Announcement \u2013 SKTKS |via=[[Twitter]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Luv-Ranjan-teams-up-with-Bhushan-Kumar-for-a-romcom/articleshow/55263070.cms |title=Luv Ranjan teams up with Bhushan Kumar for a romcom |work=[[The Times of India]]}}</ref> The shooting for the film began on 12 December 2016<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/taran_adarsh/status/808275559499190272 |title=Luv Ranjan's new film launched |via=[[Twitter]]}}</ref> while the title of the film was officially announced by Kartik Aaryan, Nushrat Bharucha and Sunny Singh through a [[YouTube]] video on 16 June 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wfk8Y3ULKOk |title=Title Announcement Video \u2013 Luv Ranjan \u2013 Kartik Aaryan, Nushrat Bharucha, Sunny Singh,Saurav Singh |via=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> The official trailer of the film was launched on 20 December 2017.<ref name=\"OT\" />\n\n{{cquote|\u201cIn India, they say that marriage happens between two families.
