It has a [[Roud Folk Song Index]] number of 19334. After a notable nursery success, it was eventually adapted to a large variety of practical and entertaining uses.\n\n==Lyrics==\n[[File:Old Mother Hubbards Cottage, Yealmpton.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Old Mother Hubbard's Cottage, said to be where the rhyme's original lived]] \n[[File:Kitley-House_1829-print-60512-p.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Kitley House, residence of the Pollexfen Bastard family, in 1829]]\nThe first published version of ''The Comic Adventures of Old Mother Hubbard and her Dog'' is attributed to [[Sir Henry Martin, 1st Baronet#Sarah Catherine Martin|Sarah Catherine Martin]] (1768\u20131826) and associated with a [[cottage]] in [[Yealmpton]], Devon,<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo_Z5bMr6eA British Pathe, 1960]</ref> close by where she was staying at Kitley House. The book was \"illustrated with fifteen elegant engravings on copper plate\" and had a dedication to her host \"[[John Pollexfen Bastard|J.B. Esq MP]], at whose suggestion and at whose House these Notable Sketches were design\u2019d\", signed S. C.M.<ref>Illustrations at [https://www.bromer.com/pages/books/27789/sarah-catherine-martin/the-comic-adventures-of-old-mother-hubbard-and-her-dog Bromer Books]</ref>\nThe poem begins \n<blockquote><poem>\nOld Mother Hubbard\nWent to the Cupboard,\nTo give the poor Dog a bone;\nWhen she came there,\nThe Cupboard was bare,\nAnd so the poor Dog had none.\n\nShe went to the Bakers\nTo buy him some Bread;\nWhen she came back\nThe Dog was dead!\n\nShe went to the Undertakers\nTo buy him a coffin;\nWhen she came back\nThe Dog was laughing.</poem></blockquote>\n\nThis is followed by a series of quatrains in similar format relating to the pair's further activities, the number of stanzas varying in later publications. However, there is evidence to suggest that only the continuation after the first three stanzas was the work of Ms Martin. A review of her work that appeared in ''[[The Guardian of Education]]'' praised \"this little book, the poetry of which is of ancient date ... We can recollect, at this distance of time, that in our infant days the Story of this renowned woman, though full of inconsistencies we confess, afforded us much entertainment.\"<ref>Delaney 2012, p.120</ref> Since the reviewer, [[Sarah Trimmer]], was born in 1741, that would date back the rhyme's earlier version fifty years or more.\n\nA musical variant of the introductory verses was set by [[Samuel Arnold (composer)|Samuel Arnold]] in his ''Juvenile Amusements'' (1797), except that it is not the dog but \"the poor Children\" who are the object of Mother Hubbard's charity.<ref>Opie 1997, p.177</ref> Another song in Arnold's work was \"[[There was an Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe]]\", which had been given two final lines:\n<poem>Then out went th\u2019 old woman to bespeak \u2018em a coffin,\nAnd when she came back, she found \u2018em all a-loffeing.<ref>Opie 1997, p.522</ref></poem>\n\nOn the basis of the coffin/laughing rhymes (which could date from Shakespearean times), [[James Orchard Halliwell]] was led to believe that \"the tale of \"Old Mother Hubbard\" is undoubtedly of some antiquity\".<ref>James Orchard Halliwell, Popular Rhymes and Nursery Tales, 1849, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/35707/35707-h/35707-h.htm#i-nursery-antiquities \"Nursery Antiquities\" section]</ref>\n\nAnother nonsense song with a similar template had been published two years before the appearance of Ms Martin's Mother Hubbard variations. During the course of ''Old Dame Trot and her Wonderful Cat'' (1803), the Dame looks in the cupboard for fish but finds none, \"for puss had been there before\". Two more suggestive stanzas follow:<ref>''The Moving Adventure of Old Dame Trot and Her Comical Cat'', Darton 1807, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_YgyAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false pp.3-5]</ref>\n<blockquote><poem>\nShe went to the butcher\u2019s\nTo buy her some meat,\nWhen she came back\nShe lay dead at her feet.\n\nShe went to the undertaker\u2019s\nFor a coffin and shroud,\nWhen she came back\nPuss sat up and mewed</poem></blockquote>\n\nThereafter the cat continues to perform household chores and comic feats and the two exchange courtesies in the final stanza, much as do Mother Hubbard and her dog at the end of Ms Martin's work. But while Mother Hubbard's dog goes on to perform similar feats to Dame Trot's cat, such as smoking, playing a musical instrument and riding another animal, he also shows his superior cleverness by sometimes anticipating what his mistress has brought on her return. He greets beer by sitting ready at table; he receives wine by exuberantly standing on his head; when linen comes, he is spinning; when stockings arrive, he is dressed already.\n\n==Editions==\nThe book was immediately popular thanks to the astute marketing skills of the publisher, John Harris.<ref>Delaney 2012, ch.3 \"John Harris and the rise of the picturebook\", p.105 ff</ref> To feed the enthusiasm he had created, Harris commissioned a separately published continuation from Ms Martin in which the dog finds a bride,<ref>[https://www.dsloan.com/Auctions/A22/item-children-literature-martin-mother-hubbard.html Dorothy Sloan Books]</ref> and early in the following year published \"a sequel\u2026written by another hand\".<ref>Specimen title and pages at [https://www.davidmilesbooks.com/book/13844/a-sequel-to-the-comic-adventures-of-old-mother-hubbard David Miles Books]</ref> Such was the popular reputation of the work at that time that the satirist [[John Wolcot|Peter Pindar]] made it a target in one of his pieces in which \"The Poet condemns the present general Taste and foretells the Return of the Ages of Barbarism\":\n[[File:Old Mother Hubbard and Her Dog 1889.jpg|thumb|1889 United States depiction]]\n:: In vain I preach, in vain in scorn I smile\u2026\n::Where Rapture doats on Mother Hubbard\u2019s Tales!<ref>''Tristia'' (1806) in ''The Works of Peter Pindar'', [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tDEip6dB65UC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=Hubbard&f=false vol.5, p.318]</ref>\n\nOver the years pirated editions, new versions and imitations appeared from other presses, catering to the continuing demand.<ref>There is a partial list of the various titles under which the work was published and where they appeared at [http://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n80067273 WorldCat]</ref> The first American edition of 1807 was marketed under the new title of \"A curious account of the comic adventures of Old Mother Hubbard and her dog\".<ref>[https://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/u4589336 University of Virginia]</ref> During the early years, the book illustrations had been based on those provided by the author, but the 1819 edition came with new designs ascribed to [[Allen Robert Branston]] and was further subtitled \"In which is shewn the wonderful powers that good old lady possessed in the education of her favourite animal\".<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/comicadventureso00martiala?ref=ol#page/n3/mode/2up Internet Archive]</ref>\n\nThe designs in books published outside London were often more basic, such as those in the 1840 edition from [[Devonport, Plymouth|Devonport]],<ref>[https://archive.org/details/McGillLibrary-PN970_K49_D76_1840-1208 Internet Archive]</ref> which was retitled ''The droll adventures of Mother Hubbard and her dog'' and came with a rhymed summary of the story on its back cover; or the 1840 Banbury edition, to which were added several more stanzas that brought their number up to twenty-three.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/McGillLibrary-PN970_R87_H57_1820_000116077-2018/PN970_R87_H57_1820_000116077#mode/1up McGill Library]</ref> About that year also there appeared ''New Adventures of Mother Hubbard'', in which the pair proceed to additional and more up to date adventures, such as paying a visit to the zoo and journeying by train and balloon.<ref>Cotsen Children\u2019s Library [https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/cotsen/wp-content/uploads/sites/88/2017/05/26792leaf7left.jpg Princeton University]</ref><ref>Little stories for young folks, [https://archive.org/details/littlestoriesfor00twst/page/n15 pp.16 \u2013 27]</ref>\n\nAnother enrichment was brought to the rhyme when it began to appear as a [[Pop-up book#History|moveable book]], so that the child could animate the scenes pictured. Paper tabs toward the bottom of the illustration could be pulled back and forth so as to make Mother Hubbard's hands move, or her dog nod its head, bow, feed the cat and spin wool.<ref>An example at [https://www.bromer.com/pages/books/28095/old-mother-hubbard-deans-moveable-books Bromer Books]</ref>\n\n[[File:Old_Mother_Hubbard_alphabet_plate.jpg|thumb|A Victorian alphabet plate based on the rhyme's first stanza]]\n\n===Educational===\nJohn Harris\u2019 publications marked a shift from moralising works for children to catering for their imaginative entertainment, in which his Mother Hubbard series of books played a decisive part.<ref>Delaney 2012, pp.105-7</ref> Nevertheless, other publishers developed strategies whereby amusement and instruction might be combined. One American publisher included a complete set of [[serif]] type opposite the title page, featuring capitals, small letters, italics, ligatures and numbers, as an aid to further reading.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/oldmotherhubbard00martiala?ref=ol#page/n3/mode/2up H. & E.

It was not until a decade later that there was mention of a Christmas [[pantomime#Development of pantomime in Britain|pantomime]], at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], that was \"founded on the familiar nursery-tale of Old Mother Hubbard and her dog\".<ref>''The Sphynx'' #24, 15 December 1827, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lMNeAAAAcAAJ&pg=PP381&dq=%22Old+Mother+Hubbard%22+political&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiWxaDB_oTlAhUQTcAKHVfLCzMQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q=%22Old%20Mother%20Hubbard%22%20political&f=false, p.37]</ref>\nThereafter, as many familiar characters as possible were packed into the same production, which was given a composite title.

In one, Mother Hubbard has gone \n<blockquote><poem>\nTo get her poor daughter a gown,\nBut the cupboard was bare\nSo the damsel sat there\nWith little else on but a frown.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Hubbard-Nursery-Original-Vintage-Postcard/dp/B00P5F56EA Amazon]</ref></blockquote></poem> \nAlternatively she went \"to get her poor daughter a dress\", but \"the cupboard was bare, and so was her daughter, I guess.\"<ref>Taylor Art Co, Rhymelets, [https://www.hippostcard.com/listing/rhymelets-old-mother-hubbardempty-dress-cupboardbare-daughterpoem1910/14553061 Hippostcards]</ref>\n\nParodies have continued into the musical sphere too. There was a comic quartet by the Australian clergyman [[Alfred Wheeler (composer)|Alfred Wheeler]], first performed during the 1920s.

It was followed in 1604 by [[Thomas Middleton]]'s ''Father Hubburd\u2019s Tales'', which contained the equally political fable of \"The Nightingale and the Ant\". It has also been claimed that Ms Martin's rhyme was mistakenly thought by some to have a political meaning at first,<ref>Opie 1999, p. 377</ref> although there is no reliable evidence that this was so. However, it was soon given various political contexts. In one parliamentary debate, [[George Canning]] compared the vitality of the British constitution, then declared to be under threat, to the swift revival of Mother Hubbard's dog when she bought him a coffin.<ref>[[Joachim Hayward Stocqueler]], ''The Life of Field Marshal the Duke of Wellington'', London 1853, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XKykVMEEfjMC&pg=PA143&dq=%22Old+Mother+Hubbard%22+political&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiTq-63hIXlAhXNgVwKHeFyBCoQ6AEITDAG#v=onepage&q=%22Old%20Mother%20Hubbard%22%20political&f=false vol.2, p.143]</ref> And at a later date her bare cupboard was introduced into several political cartoons, generally dealing with financial deficits.

It has a [[Roud Folk Song Index]] number of 19334. After a notable nursery success, it was eventually adapted to a large variety of practical and entertaining uses.\n\n==Lyrics==\n[[File:Old Mother Hubbards Cottage, Yealmpton.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Old Mother Hubbard's Cottage, said to be where the rhyme's original lived]] \n[[File:Kitley-House_1829-print-60512-p.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Kitley House, residence of the Pollexfen Bastard family, in 1829]]\nThe first published version of ''The Comic Adventures of Old Mother Hubbard and her Dog'' is attributed to [[Sir Henry Martin, 1st Baronet#Sarah Catherine Martin|Sarah Catherine Martin]] (1768\u20131826) and associated with a [[cottage]] in [[Yealmpton]], Devon,<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo_Z5bMr6eA British Pathe, 1960]</ref> close by where she was staying at Kitley House.

However, there is evidence to suggest that only the continuation after the first three stanzas was the work of Ms Martin. A review of her work that appeared in ''[[The Guardian of Education]]'' praised \"this little book, the poetry of which is of ancient date ... We can recollect, at this distance of time, that in our infant days the Story of this renowned woman, though full of inconsistencies we confess, afforded us much entertainment.\"<ref>Delaney 2012, p.120</ref> Since the reviewer, [[Sarah Trimmer]], was born in 1741, that would date back the rhyme's earlier version fifty years or more.\n\nA musical variant of the introductory verses was set by [[Samuel Arnold (composer)|Samuel Arnold]] in his ''Juvenile Amusements'' (1797), except that it is not the dog but \"the poor Children\" who are the object of Mother Hubbard's charity.<ref>Opie 1997, p.177</ref> Another song in Arnold's work was \"[[There was an Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe]]\", which had been given two final lines:\n<poem>Then out went th\u2019 old woman to bespeak \u2018em a coffin,\nAnd when she came back, she found \u2018em all a-loffeing.<ref>Opie 1997, p.522</ref></poem>\n\nOn the basis of the coffin/laughing rhymes (which could date from Shakespearean times), [[James Orchard Halliwell]] was led to believe that \"the tale of \"Old Mother Hubbard\" is undoubtedly of some antiquity\".<ref>James Orchard Halliwell, Popular Rhymes and Nursery Tales, 1849, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/35707/35707-h/35707-h.htm#i-nursery-antiquities \"Nursery Antiquities\" section]</ref>\n\nAnother nonsense song with a similar template had been published two years before the appearance of Ms Martin's Mother Hubbard variations. During the course of ''Old Dame Trot and her Wonderful Cat'' (1803), the Dame looks in the cupboard for fish but finds none, \"for puss had been there before\". Two more suggestive stanzas follow:<ref>''The Moving Adventure of Old Dame Trot and Her Comical Cat'', Darton 1807, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_YgyAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false pp.3-5]</ref>\n<blockquote><poem>\nShe went to the butcher\u2019s\nTo buy her some meat,\nWhen she came back\nShe lay dead at her feet.\n\nShe went to the undertaker\u2019s\nFor a coffin and shroud,\nWhen she came back\nPuss sat up and mewed</poem></blockquote>\n\nThereafter the cat continues to perform household chores and comic feats and the two exchange courtesies in the final stanza, much as do Mother Hubbard and her dog at the end of Ms Martin's work. But while Mother Hubbard's dog goes on to perform similar feats to Dame Trot's cat, such as smoking, playing a musical instrument and riding another animal, he also shows his superior cleverness by sometimes anticipating what his mistress has brought on her return. He greets beer by sitting ready at table; he receives wine by exuberantly standing on his head; when linen comes, he is spinning; when stockings arrive, he is dressed already.\n\n==Editions==\nThe book was immediately popular thanks to the astute marketing skills of the publisher, John Harris.<ref>Delaney 2012, ch.3 \"John Harris and the rise of the picturebook\", p.105 ff</ref> To feed the enthusiasm he had created, Harris commissioned a separately published continuation from Ms Martin in which the dog finds a bride,<ref>[https://www.dsloan.com/Auctions/A22/item-children-literature-martin-mother-hubbard.html Dorothy Sloan Books]</ref> and early in the following year published \"a sequel\u2026written by another hand\".<ref>Specimen title and pages at [https://www.davidmilesbooks.com/book/13844/a-sequel-to-the-comic-adventures-of-old-mother-hubbard David Miles Books]</ref> Such was the popular reputation of the work at that time that the satirist [[John Wolcot|Peter Pindar]] made it a target in one of his pieces in which \"The Poet condemns the present general Taste and foretells the Return of the Ages of Barbarism\":\n[[File:Old Mother Hubbard and Her Dog 1889.jpg|thumb|1889 United States depiction]]\n:: In vain I preach, in vain in scorn I smile\u2026\n::Where Rapture doats on Mother Hubbard\u2019s Tales!<ref>''Tristia'' (1806) in ''The Works of Peter Pindar'', [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tDEip6dB65UC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=Hubbard&f=false vol.5, p.318]</ref>\n\nOver the years pirated editions, new versions and imitations appeared from other presses, catering to the continuing demand.<ref>There is a partial list of the various titles under which the work was published and where they appeared at [http://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n80067273 WorldCat]</ref> The first American edition of 1807 was marketed under the new title of \"A curious account of the comic adventures of Old Mother Hubbard and her dog\".<ref>[https://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/u4589336 University of Virginia]</ref> During the early years, the book illustrations had been based on those provided by the author, but the 1819 edition came with new designs ascribed to [[Allen Robert Branston]] and was further subtitled \"In which is shewn the wonderful powers that good old lady possessed in the education of her favourite animal\".<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/comicadventureso00martiala?ref=ol#page/n3/mode/2up Internet Archive]</ref>\n\nThe designs in books published outside London were often more basic, such as those in the 1840 edition from [[Devonport, Plymouth|Devonport]],<ref>[https://archive.org/details/McGillLibrary-PN970_K49_D76_1840-1208 Internet Archive]</ref> which was retitled ''The droll adventures of Mother Hubbard and her dog'' and came with a rhymed summary of the story on its back cover; or the 1840 Banbury edition, to which were added several more stanzas that brought their number up to twenty-three.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/McGillLibrary-PN970_R87_H57_1820_000116077-2018/PN970_R87_H57_1820_000116077#mode/1up McGill Library]</ref> About that year also there appeared ''New Adventures of Mother Hubbard'', in which the pair proceed to additional and more up to date adventures, such as paying a visit to the zoo and journeying by train and balloon.<ref>Cotsen Children\u2019s Library [https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/cotsen/wp-content/uploads/sites/88/2017/05/26792leaf7left.jpg Princeton University]</ref><ref>Little stories for young folks, [https://archive.org/details/littlestoriesfor00twst/page/n15 pp.16 \u2013 27]</ref>\n\nAnother enrichment was brought to the rhyme when it began to appear as a [[Pop-up book#History|moveable book]], so that the child could animate the scenes pictured. Paper tabs toward the bottom of the illustration could be pulled back and forth so as to make Mother Hubbard's hands move, or her dog nod its head, bow, feed the cat and spin wool.<ref>An example at [https://www.bromer.com/pages/books/28095/old-mother-hubbard-deans-moveable-books Bromer Books]</ref>\n\n[[File:Old_Mother_Hubbard_alphabet_plate.jpg|thumb|A Victorian alphabet plate based on the rhyme's first stanza]]\n\n===Educational===\nJohn Harris\u2019 publications marked a shift from moralising works for children to catering for their imaginative entertainment, in which his Mother Hubbard series of books played a decisive part.<ref>Delaney 2012, pp.105-7</ref> Nevertheless, other publishers developed strategies whereby amusement and instruction might be combined. One American publisher included a complete set of [[serif]] type opposite the title page, featuring capitals, small letters, italics, ligatures and numbers, as an aid to further reading.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/oldmotherhubbard00martiala?ref=ol#page/n3/mode/2up H. & E.

It was followed in 1604 by [[Thomas Middleton]]'s ''Father Hubburd\u2019s Tales'', which contained the equally political fable of \"The Nightingale and the Ant\". It has also been claimed that Ms Martin's rhyme was mistakenly thought by some to have a political meaning at first,<ref>Opie 1999, p. 377</ref> although there is no reliable evidence that this was so. However, it was soon given various political contexts. In one parliamentary debate, [[George Canning]] compared the vitality of the British constitution, then declared to be under threat, to the swift revival of Mother Hubbard's dog when she bought him a coffin.<ref>[[Joachim Hayward Stocqueler]], ''The Life of Field Marshal the Duke of Wellington'', London 1853, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XKykVMEEfjMC&pg=PA143&dq=%22Old+Mother+Hubbard%22+political&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiTq-63hIXlAhXNgVwKHeFyBCoQ6AEITDAG#v=onepage&q=%22Old%20Mother%20Hubbard%22%20political&f=false vol.2, p.143]</ref> And at a later date her bare cupboard was introduced into several political cartoons, generally dealing with financial deficits.

While the Frankish Realm was primarily inhabited by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes like the [[Franks]] and the [[Saxons]], the regions east of the border rivers were inhabited by [[Slavs|Slavic]] tribes. This is why most of the cities and villages in northeastern Germany bear [[Slavic languages|Slavic]]-derived names ([[Germania Slavica]]). Typical [[Germanisation|Germanised]] place name [[suffix]]es of Slavic origin are ''-ow'', ''-itz'', ''-vitz'', ''-witz'', ''-itzsch'' and ''-in'', [[prefix]]es are ''Windisch'' and ''Wendisch''. The name ''Berlin'' has its roots in the language of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] inhabitants of the area of today's Berlin, and may be related to the Old [[Polabian language|Polabian]] stem ''berl-''/''birl-'' (\"swamp\").<ref>{{Cite book|last=Berger|first=Dieter|title=Geographische Namen in Deutschland|publisher=Bibliographisches Institut|year=1999|isbn=978-3-411-06252-2}}</ref> Since the ''Ber-'' at the beginning sounds like the German word ''B\u00e4r'' (bear), a bear appears in the coat of arms of the city.

The city's appearance today is predominantly shaped by the key role it played in Germany's history in the 20th century. Each of the national governments based in Berlin{{snd}} the Kingdom of Prussia, the 2nd German Empire of 1871, the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, East Germany, and now the reunified Germany{{snd}} initiated ambitious reconstruction programs, with each adding its own distinctive style to the city's architecture.\n\nBerlin was devastated by [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|bombing raids]], fires and street battles during World War II, and many of the buildings that remained after the war were demolished in the post-war period in both West and East Berlin. Much of this demolition was initiated by municipal architecture programs to build new residential or business quarters and main roads. Many [[Ornament (art)|ornaments]] of pre-war buildings were destroyed following [[Ornament and Crime|modernist dogmas]], while in both systems and in reunified Berlin, various important heritage monuments were also (partly) [[Reconstruction (architecture)|reconstructed]], including the ''Forum Fridericianum'' with e.g., the [[Berlin State Opera|State Opera]] (1955), [[Charlottenburg Palace]] (1957), the main monuments of the [[Gendarmenmarkt]] (1980s), [[Alte Kommandantur|Kommandantur]] (2003) and the project to reconstruct the baroque fa\u00e7ades of the [[City Palace, Berlin|City Palace]]. A number of new buildings are inspired by historical predecessors or the general classical style of Berlin, such as [[Hotel Adlon]].\n\nClusters of [[List of tallest buildings in Berlin|high-rise buildings]] emerge at disperse locations, e.g. [[Potsdamer Platz]], [[City West]], and [[Alexanderplatz]], the latter two representing the previous centers of West and East Berlin, respectively, and the former representing the new Berlin of the 21st century built upon the previous no-man's land of the Berlin Wall. Berlin has three of the top 40 [[List of tallest buildings in Germany|tallest buildings]] in Germany.\n\n===Architecture===\n{{Main|Architecture in Berlin}}\n{{Further|List of sights in Berlin|List of tallest buildings in Berlin}}\n[[File:20190113 Berlin 0510.jpg|thumb|View of [[Gendarmenmarkt]], with the [[Konzerthaus Berlin]] to the right and the [[Neue Kirche, Berlin|German Church]] in the back]]\n[[File:Berliner Dom seen from James Simon Park.jpg|thumb|The [[Berlin Cathedral]] at [[Museum Island]]]]\nThe [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Fernsehturm]] (TV tower) at [[Alexanderplatz]] in [[Mitte]] is among the tallest structures in the European Union at {{convert|368|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of Berlin. The city can be viewed from its {{convert|204|m|ft|abbr=on}} high observation floor. Starting here the [[Karl-Marx-Allee]] heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the [[Socialist Classicism]] style. Adjacent to this area is the [[Rotes Rathaus]] (City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture. In front of it is the [[Neptunbrunnen]], a fountain featuring a mythological group of [[Triton (mythology)|Tritons]], [[personification]]s of the four main Prussian rivers and [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] on top of it.\n\nThe [[Brandenburg Gate]] is an iconic landmark of Berlin and Germany; it stands as a symbol of eventful European history and of unity and peace. The [[Reichstag building]] is the traditional seat of the German Parliament. It was remodelled by British architect [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]] in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city.\n\nThe [[East Side Gallery]] is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the Berlin Wall. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city's historical division.\n\nThe [[Gendarmenmarkt]] is a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] square in Berlin, the name of which derives from the headquarters of the famous Gens d'armes regiment located here in the 18th century. It is bordered by two similarly designed cathedrals, the [[Franz\u00f6sischer Dom]] with its observation platform and the [[Deutscher Dom]]. The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall), home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals.\n\nThe [[Museum Island]] in the [[River Spree]] houses [[Berlin#Museums|five museums]] built from 1830 to 1930 and is a UNESCO World Heritage site.

This includes the [[Hackesche H\u00f6fe]], a conglomeration of buildings around several courtyards, reconstructed around 1996. The nearby [[New Synagogue, Berlin|New Synagogue]] is the center of Jewish culture.\n\nThe [[Stra\u00dfe des 17. Juni]], connecting the Brandenburg Gate and Ernst-Reuter-Platz, serves as the central east\u2013west axis. Its name commemorates the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|uprisings in East Berlin of 17 June 1953]]. Approximately halfway from the Brandenburg Gate is the Gro\u00dfer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the [[Berlin Victory Column|Siegess\u00e4ule]] (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated in 1938\u201339 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag.\n\nThe [[Kurf\u00fcrstendamm]] is home to some of Berlin's luxurious stores with the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]] at its eastern end on [[Breitscheidplatz]]. The church was destroyed in the Second World War and left in ruins. Nearby on Tauentzienstra\u00dfe is [[KaDeWe]], claimed to be continental Europe's largest department store. The [[Rathaus Sch\u00f6neberg]], where [[John F. Kennedy]] made his famous \"[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]!\" speech, is in [[Tempelhof-Sch\u00f6neberg]].\n\nWest of the center, [[Bellevue Palace (Germany)|Bellevue Palace]] is the residence of the German President. [[Charlottenburg Palace]], which was burnt out in the Second World War, is the largest historical palace in Berlin.\n\nThe [[Funkturm Berlin]] is a {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall lattice radio tower in the fairground area, built between 1924 and 1926. It is the only observation tower which stands on insulators and has a restaurant {{convert|55|m|ft|abbr=on}} and an observation deck {{convert|126|m|ft|abbr=on}} above ground, which is reachable by a windowed elevator.\n\nThe [[Oberbaumbr\u00fccke]] over the Spree river is Berlin's most iconic bridge, connecting the now-combined boroughs of [[Friedrichshain]] and [[Kreuzberg]]. It carries vehicles, pedestrians, and the U1 [[Berlin U-Bahn]] line. The bridge was completed in a [[brick gothic]] style in 1896, replacing the former wooden bridge, with an upper deck for the U-Bahn. The center portion was demolished in 1945 to stop the [[Red Army]] from crossing. After the war, the repaired bridge served as a [[Berlin border crossings|checkpoint and border crossing]] between the Soviet and American sectors, and later between East and West Berlin. In the mid-1950s it was closed to vehicles, and after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, pedestrian traffic was heavily restricted. Following German reunification, the center portion was reconstructed with a steel frame, and U-Bahn service resumed in 1995.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Main|Demographics of Berlin}}\n[[File:Berlin population2.svg|thumb|left|Berlin's population, 1880\u20132012]]\nAt the end of 2018, the city-state of Berlin had 3.75&nbsp;million registered inhabitants<ref name=\"pop-detail\"/> in an area of {{convert|891.1|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"statoffice\"/> The city's population density was 4,206 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>.

At present, Berlin consists of 96 subdistricts, which are commonly made up of several smaller residential areas or quarters.\n\nEach borough is governed by a borough council (''Bezirksamt'') consisting of five councilors (''Bezirksstadtr\u00e4te'') including the borough's mayor (''Bezirksb\u00fcrgermeister''). The council is elected by the borough assembly (''Bezirksverordnetenversammlung''). However, the individual boroughs are not independent municipalities, but subordinate to the Senate of Berlin.<!-- ([[urban district]], ''Stadtkreis'') --> The borough's mayors make up the council of mayors (''Rat der B\u00fcrgermeister''), which is led by the city's Governing Mayor and advises the Senate.

While the Frankish Realm was primarily inhabited by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes like the [[Franks]] and the [[Saxons]], the regions east of the border rivers were inhabited by [[Slavs|Slavic]] tribes. This is why most of the cities and villages in northeastern Germany bear [[Slavic languages|Slavic]]-derived names ([[Germania Slavica]]). Typical [[Germanisation|Germanised]] place name [[suffix]]es of Slavic origin are ''-ow'', ''-itz'', ''-vitz'', ''-witz'', ''-itzsch'' and ''-in'', [[prefix]]es are ''Windisch'' and ''Wendisch''. The name ''Berlin'' has its roots in the language of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] inhabitants of the area of today's Berlin, and may be related to the Old [[Polabian language|Polabian]] stem ''berl-''/''birl-'' (\"swamp\").<ref>{{Cite book|last=Berger|first=Dieter|title=Geographische Namen in Deutschland|publisher=Bibliographisches Institut|year=1999|isbn=978-3-411-06252-2}}</ref> Since the ''Ber-'' at the beginning sounds like the German word ''B\u00e4r'' (bear), a bear appears in the coat of arms of the city.

The ''Berliner Urstromtal'' (an ice age [[glacial valley]]), between the low [[Barnim Plateau]] to the north and the [[Teltow plateau]] to the south, was formed by meltwater flowing from ice sheets at the end of the last [[Weichselian glaciation]]. The [[Spree]] follows this valley now. In Spandau, a borough in the west of Berlin, the Spree empties into the river [[Havel]], which flows from north to south through western Berlin. The course of the Havel is more like a chain of lakes, the largest being the Tegeler See and the [[Gro\u00dfer Wannsee]].

The city's appearance today is predominantly shaped by the key role it played in Germany's history in the 20th century. Each of the national governments based in Berlin{{snd}} the Kingdom of Prussia, the 2nd German Empire of 1871, the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, East Germany, and now the reunified Germany{{snd}} initiated ambitious reconstruction programs, with each adding its own distinctive style to the city's architecture.\n\nBerlin was devastated by [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|bombing raids]], fires and street battles during World War II, and many of the buildings that remained after the war were demolished in the post-war period in both West and East Berlin. Much of this demolition was initiated by municipal architecture programs to build new residential or business quarters and main roads. Many [[Ornament (art)|ornaments]] of pre-war buildings were destroyed following [[Ornament and Crime|modernist dogmas]], while in both systems and in reunified Berlin, various important heritage monuments were also (partly) [[Reconstruction (architecture)|reconstructed]], including the ''Forum Fridericianum'' with e.g., the [[Berlin State Opera|State Opera]] (1955), [[Charlottenburg Palace]] (1957), the main monuments of the [[Gendarmenmarkt]] (1980s), [[Alte Kommandantur|Kommandantur]] (2003) and the project to reconstruct the baroque fa\u00e7ades of the [[City Palace, Berlin|City Palace]]. A number of new buildings are inspired by historical predecessors or the general classical style of Berlin, such as [[Hotel Adlon]].\n\nClusters of [[List of tallest buildings in Berlin|high-rise buildings]] emerge at disperse locations, e.g. [[Potsdamer Platz]], [[City West]], and [[Alexanderplatz]], the latter two representing the previous centers of West and East Berlin, respectively, and the former representing the new Berlin of the 21st century built upon the previous no-man's land of the Berlin Wall.

Built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of Berlin. The city can be viewed from its {{convert|204|m|ft|abbr=on}} high observation floor. Starting here the [[Karl-Marx-Allee]] heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the [[Socialist Classicism]] style. Adjacent to this area is the [[Rotes Rathaus]] (City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture. In front of it is the [[Neptunbrunnen]], a fountain featuring a mythological group of [[Triton (mythology)|Tritons]], [[personification]]s of the four main Prussian rivers and [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] on top of it.\n\nThe [[Brandenburg Gate]] is an iconic landmark of Berlin and Germany; it stands as a symbol of eventful European history and of unity and peace. The [[Reichstag building]] is the traditional seat of the German Parliament. It was remodelled by British architect [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]] in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city.\n\nThe [[East Side Gallery]] is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the Berlin Wall. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city's historical division.\n\nThe [[Gendarmenmarkt]] is a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] square in Berlin, the name of which derives from the headquarters of the famous Gens d'armes regiment located here in the 18th century. It is bordered by two similarly designed cathedrals, the [[Franz\u00f6sischer Dom]] with its observation platform and the [[Deutscher Dom]]. The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall), home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals.\n\nThe [[Museum Island]] in the [[River Spree]] houses [[Berlin#Museums|five museums]] built from 1830 to 1930 and is a UNESCO World Heritage site.

This includes the [[Hackesche H\u00f6fe]], a conglomeration of buildings around several courtyards, reconstructed around 1996. The nearby [[New Synagogue, Berlin|New Synagogue]] is the center of Jewish culture.\n\nThe [[Stra\u00dfe des 17. Juni]], connecting the Brandenburg Gate and Ernst-Reuter-Platz, serves as the central east\u2013west axis. Its name commemorates the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|uprisings in East Berlin of 17 June 1953]]. Approximately halfway from the Brandenburg Gate is the Gro\u00dfer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the [[Berlin Victory Column|Siegess\u00e4ule]] (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated in 1938\u201339 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag.\n\nThe [[Kurf\u00fcrstendamm]] is home to some of Berlin's luxurious stores with the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]] at its eastern end on [[Breitscheidplatz]]. The church was destroyed in the Second World War and left in ruins. Nearby on Tauentzienstra\u00dfe is [[KaDeWe]], claimed to be continental Europe's largest department store. The [[Rathaus Sch\u00f6neberg]], where [[John F. Kennedy]] made his famous \"[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]!\" speech, is in [[Tempelhof-Sch\u00f6neberg]].\n\nWest of the center, [[Bellevue Palace (Germany)|Bellevue Palace]] is the residence of the German President. [[Charlottenburg Palace]], which was burnt out in the Second World War, is the largest historical palace in Berlin.\n\nThe [[Funkturm Berlin]] is a {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall lattice radio tower in the fairground area, built between 1924 and 1926. It is the only observation tower which stands on insulators and has a restaurant {{convert|55|m|ft|abbr=on}} and an observation deck {{convert|126|m|ft|abbr=on}} above ground, which is reachable by a windowed elevator.\n\nThe [[Oberbaumbr\u00fccke]] over the Spree river is Berlin's most iconic bridge, connecting the now-combined boroughs of [[Friedrichshain]] and [[Kreuzberg]]. It carries vehicles, pedestrians, and the U1 [[Berlin U-Bahn]] line. The bridge was completed in a [[brick gothic]] style in 1896, replacing the former wooden bridge, with an upper deck for the U-Bahn. The center portion was demolished in 1945 to stop the [[Red Army]] from crossing. After the war, the repaired bridge served as a [[Berlin border crossings|checkpoint and border crossing]] between the Soviet and American sectors, and later between East and West Berlin. In the mid-1950s it was closed to vehicles, and after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, pedestrian traffic was heavily restricted. Following German reunification, the center portion was reconstructed with a steel frame, and U-Bahn service resumed in 1995.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Main|Demographics of Berlin}}\n[[File:Berlin population2.svg|thumb|left|Berlin's population, 1880\u20132012]]\nAt the end of 2018, the city-state of Berlin had 3.75&nbsp;million registered inhabitants<ref name=\"pop-detail\"/> in an area of {{convert|891.1|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"statoffice\"/> The city's population density was 4,206 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>.

These were, in addition to Catalan schoolchildren who were fortunate enough to stay in their school, refugees from Madrid who had witnessed tragic events. The Brauners made a pedo-psychiatric analysis of the child's drawing, a privileged mode of graphic expression of the young child, highlighting what seems to them characteristic of the child's drawing in the war, taking notes, creating medical records and questionnaires. Drawings and writings of children of the Spanish War were the result of a contest organized by Alfred Brauner among the children of Barcelona in 1938 on three themes: \"My life Before the War\", \"What I Saw from the War\" and \"How I See My Life after the War\".<ref name=thesis/> It was then the beginning of their work on \"children who have lived through the war.\" 4000 drawings of refugee children and numerous essays were collected in Spain, which later, along with other drawings of children in war, offered a unique testimony of the conflicts of the 20th century through the eyes of children.<ref name=\"\">{{Cite journal | last1 =Ibarz Serrat  | first1 = Virgilio  | authorlink = | title = Los dibujos infantiles de la guerra 1937-1938: el caso de la ni\u00f1a de Ballobar | doi = | journal = Diario del AltoArag\u00f3n | volume =  | issue =  | pages = | year = 2009  | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref> Their project to publish drawings and testimonies of children in war received the support of [[Ilya Ehrenburg]] and [[Romain Rolland]] who \"regarded this collection as of considerable educational, historical and human interest.\"<ref name=\"Yannick Ripa\"/>\n \nIn 1939, Alfred Brauner welcomed 130 Jewish children from the Palatinate, Berlin and Austria,<ref name=\"L'accueil\"/> survivors of the [[Kristallnacht]] at La Guette, a French castle owned by the Rothschild family and made available by [[Baroness Germaine de Rothschild]].<ref name=\"La Guette\">{{Cite web|url= http://www.ajpn.org/sauvetage-Chateau-de-la-Guette-245.html |title= Ch\u00e2teau de la Guette durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale (WWII) |accessdate=21 April 2020 |website= www.ajpn.org/index.php | publisher= }}</ref><ref name=\"\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Lochy  | first1 = Emilie | authorlink = | title = Extrait de l'ouvrage : Enfances en guerre - T\u00e9moignages d'enfants sur la guerre | doi = | journal = Le Cercle Psy | volume = 12  | issue =  | pages = | year = 2014 | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref> Alfred\u2019s  intention was to analyze the problems posed in working with children traumatized by their experiences and by separation from their families, with the aim of adapting them to a new life and preparing them for integration into France.<ref name=\"L'accueil\"/> He then described this educational experience in his state thesis, defended in 1946, entitled \"The Psychic Repercussions of Modern War on Childhood.\"<ref name=thesis/>\n \nFrom January 1941, Alfred Brauner entered the [[French Resistance]] and welcomed the [[Austrian resistance]]\u2019s leadership in his [[Rue Bonaparte]] apartment in [[Paris]].<ref name=\"Resistance\"/><ref name=\"Bio\"/> With members of the [[\u00d6sterreichische Freiheitsfront]] arriving every morning at a specific time, Alfred Brauner decided to open a German Language course as a cover from [[Gestapo]].<ref name=\"Resistance\"/> In 1945, he helped welcoming and educating 444 surviving boys from the [[Auschwitz]] and [[Buchenwald]] [[concentration camps]], in the scope of the [[Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants]] (OSE) in [[Ecouis]], [[France]].<ref name=\"Boltanski\">{{cite book | author = Boltanski Christophe | title = La Cache | page= | publisher = Stock | year = 2015  | isbn = 978-2-234-07637-2}}</ref><ref name=\"L'accueil\"/><ref name=\"Bio\"/> This welcoming of Buchenwald's child survivors in children's homes inspired the script of the film [[Nina's House]],<ref name=\" \">{{Cite web|url= https://jeudisducinema.be/La-maison-de-Nina |title= La maison de Nina |accessdate=21 April 2020 |website= jeudisducinema.be/ | publisher=Les jeudis du cinema }}</ref> as well as the documentary [[The Boys of Buchenwald]].\n \nIn 1950, Alfred Brauner created the \"Practical Research for Children,\" which brings together professionals of childhood in order to develop medico-pedagogical methods intended for the education of children with mental disabilities.<ref name=\"Mintec\"/> In 1955, he founded a day hospital for mentally and physically handicapped children located in the center of Paris, then transferred to Saint-Mand\u00e9, and worked on the rehabilitation of these children, giving priority to their education.<ref name=\"Bio\"/> Alfred Brauner was the ambassador of the association \"''Children Refugees of the World,''\" as well as the only non-physician president of the ''Society of Expression Psychopathology and Art Therapy''.<ref name=\"SFPE\">{{Cite web|url= https://www.sfpe-art-therapie.fr/Quelques-dates-qui-marquent-les-avancees-sur-trois-voies-paralleles_a34.html |title= Quelques dates qui marquent les avanc\u00e9es sur trois voies parall\u00e8les.

These were, in addition to Catalan schoolchildren who were fortunate enough to stay in their school, refugees from Madrid who had witnessed tragic events. The Brauners made a pedo-psychiatric analysis of the child's drawing, a privileged mode of graphic expression of the young child, highlighting what seems to them characteristic of the child's drawing in the war, taking notes, creating medical records and questionnaires. Drawings and writings of children of the Spanish War were the result of a contest organized by Alfred Brauner among the children of Barcelona in 1938 on three themes: \"My life Before the War\", \"What I Saw from the War\" and \"How I See My Life after the War\".<ref name=thesis/> It was then the beginning of their work on \"children who have lived through the war.\" 4000 drawings of refugee children and numerous essays were collected in Spain, which later, along with other drawings of children in war, offered a unique testimony of the conflicts of the 20th century through the eyes of children.<ref name=\"\">{{Cite journal | last1 =Ibarz Serrat  | first1 = Virgilio  | authorlink = | title = Los dibujos infantiles de la guerra 1937-1938: el caso de la ni\u00f1a de Ballobar | doi = | journal = Diario del AltoArag\u00f3n | volume =  | issue =  | pages = | year = 2009  | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref> Their project to publish drawings and testimonies of children in war received the support of [[Ilya Ehrenburg]] and [[Romain Rolland]] who \"regarded this collection as of considerable educational, historical and human interest.\"<ref name=\"Yannick Ripa\"/>\n \nIn 1939, Alfred Brauner welcomed 130 Jewish children from the Palatinate, Berlin and Austria,<ref name=\"L'accueil\"/> survivors of the [[Kristallnacht]] at La Guette, a French castle owned by the Rothschild family and made available by [[Baroness Germaine de Rothschild]].<ref name=\"La Guette\">{{Cite web|url= http://www.ajpn.org/sauvetage-Chateau-de-la-Guette-245.html |title= Ch\u00e2teau de la Guette durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale (WWII) |accessdate=21 April 2020 |website= www.ajpn.org/index.php | publisher= }}</ref><ref name=\"\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Lochy  | first1 = Emilie | authorlink = | title = Extrait de l'ouvrage : Enfances en guerre - T\u00e9moignages d'enfants sur la guerre | doi = | journal = Le Cercle Psy | volume = 12  | issue =  | pages = | year = 2014 | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref> Alfred\u2019s  intention was to analyze the problems posed in working with children traumatized by their experiences and by separation from their families, with the aim of adapting them to a new life and preparing them for integration into France.<ref name=\"L'accueil\"/> He then described this educational experience in his state thesis, defended in 1946, entitled \"The Psychic Repercussions of Modern War on Childhood.\"<ref name=thesis/>\n \nFrom January 1941, Alfred Brauner entered the [[French Resistance]] and welcomed the [[Austrian resistance]]\u2019s leadership in his [[Rue Bonaparte]] apartment in [[Paris]].<ref name=\"Resistance\"/><ref name=\"Bio\"/> With members of the [[\u00d6sterreichische Freiheitsfront]] arriving every morning at a specific time, Alfred Brauner decided to open a German Language course as a cover from [[Gestapo]].<ref name=\"Resistance\"/> In 1945, he helped welcoming and educating 444 surviving boys from the [[Auschwitz]] and [[Buchenwald]] [[concentration camps]], in the scope of the [[Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants]] (OSE) in [[Ecouis]], [[France]].<ref name=\"Boltanski\">{{cite book | author = Boltanski Christophe | title = La Cache | page= | publisher = Stock | year = 2015  | isbn = 978-2-234-07637-2}}</ref><ref name=\"L'accueil\"/><ref name=\"Bio\"/> This welcoming of Buchenwald's child survivors in children's homes inspired the script of the film [[Nina's House]],<ref name=\" \">{{Cite web|url= https://jeudisducinema.be/La-maison-de-Nina |title= La maison de Nina |accessdate=21 April 2020 |website= jeudisducinema.be/ | publisher=Les jeudis du cinema }}</ref> as well as the documentary [[The Boys of Buchenwald]].\n \nIn 1950, Alfred Brauner created the \"Practical Research for Children,\" which brings together professionals of childhood in order to develop medico-pedagogical methods intended for the education of children with mental disabilities.<ref name=\"Mintec\"/> In 1955, he founded a day hospital for mentally and physically handicapped children located in the center of Paris, then transferred to Saint-Mand\u00e9, and worked on the rehabilitation of these children, giving priority to their education.<ref name=\"Bio\"/> Alfred Brauner was the ambassador of the association \"''Children Refugees of the World,''\" as well as the only non-physician president of the ''Society of Expression Psychopathology and Art Therapy''.<ref name=\"SFPE\">{{Cite web|url= https://www.sfpe-art-therapie.fr/Quelques-dates-qui-marquent-les-avancees-sur-trois-voies-paralleles_a34.html |title= Quelques dates qui marquent les avanc\u00e9es sur trois voies parall\u00e8les.

As a result of the subsequent redistricting of house seats, much of Peters' 9th district, including his home in Bloomfield Hills, was merged with the [[Michigan's 12th congressional district|12th district]], represented by fellow Democrat [[Sander Levin]].  The new district retained Peters' district number\u2014the 9th\u2014but geographically was more Levin's district.\n\nIn September 2011, Peters opted to run in the newly redrawn 14th District.  The district had previously been the 13th District, represented by freshman Democrat [[Hansen Clarke]].  The redrawn district is based in Detroit, but contains a large chunk of Peters' old State Senate district and portions of his old congressional district.  Indeed, Peters had represented most of the Oakland County portion of the district at one time or another.  Due to Detroit's dwindling population, it was no longer possible to keep the district exclusively within [[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]].\n\nIn the August 2012 Democratic primary, Peters defeated Clarke, who had opted to follow most of his constituents into the reconfigured 14th even though his home had been drawn into the reconfigured 13th\u2014the old 14th, and Southfield Mayor [[Brenda Lawrence]].  The 14th is a heavily Democratic, 58 percent black-majority district, and Peters was overwhelmingly favored in November.

As a result of the subsequent redistricting of house seats, much of Peters' 9th district, including his home in Bloomfield Hills, was merged with the [[Michigan's 12th congressional district|12th district]], represented by fellow Democrat [[Sander Levin]].  The new district retained Peters' district number\u2014the 9th\u2014but geographically was more Levin's district.\n\nIn September 2011, Peters opted to run in the newly redrawn 14th District.  The district had previously been the 13th District, represented by freshman Democrat [[Hansen Clarke]].  The redrawn district is based in Detroit, but contains a large chunk of Peters' old State Senate district and portions of his old congressional district.  Indeed, Peters had represented most of the Oakland County portion of the district at one time or another.  Due to Detroit's dwindling population, it was no longer possible to keep the district exclusively within [[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]].\n\nIn the August 2012 Democratic primary, Peters defeated Clarke, who had opted to follow most of his constituents into the reconfigured 14th even though his home had been drawn into the reconfigured 13th\u2014the old 14th, and Southfield Mayor [[Brenda Lawrence]].  The 14th is a heavily Democratic, 58 percent black-majority district, and Peters was overwhelmingly favored in November.

If it is a notable product or part of history, please add it to a later, appropriate section-->\n\n==Common features==\nAlthough modern MMORPGs sometimes differ dramatically from their predecessors, many of them share the same basic characteristics. These include several common features: persistent game environment, some form of level progression, social interaction within the game, in-game culture, system architecture, membership in a group, and character customization.\n\n===Themes===\nThe majority of popular MMORPGs are based on traditional [[fantasy]] themes, often occurring in an in-game universe comparable to that of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''. Some employ hybrid themes that either merge or replace fantasy elements with those of [[science fiction]], [[sword and sorcery]], or [[crime fiction]]. Others draw thematic material from [[American comic books]], the [[occult]], and other [[genre]]s. These elements are often developed using similar tasks and scenarios involving [[quest (gaming)|quests]], [[Mob (computer gaming)|monsters]], and [[looting (gaming)|loot]].\n\n===Progression===\nIn nearly all MMORPGs, the development of the [[player character|player's character]] is the primary goal. Nearly all MMORPGs feature a character progression system, in which players earn [[experience points]] for their actions and use those points to reach character \"levels\", which makes them better at whatever they do.<ref name=\"dog1\">{{cite book|last1=Mulligan|first1=Jessica|last2=Patrovsky|first2=Bridgette| year = 2003 | title = Developing Online Games: An Insider's Guide | publisher = New Riders | isbn = 1-59273-000-0 | pages = 474, 477| quote = [pp. 474] '''experience points''' A point value that is accumulated by gameplay activity such as '''leveling''' and is used as a measure of a character's power. Popularized by the classic dice version of TSR's ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' back in the 1970s and carried over to online gaming by designers. [pp. 477] '''level''' A rank or rating of a character's power. [...] '''leveling''' Activity in-game devoted to increasing a character's experience, level, and/or skills. Leveling usually consists of killing '''mobs'''.}}</ref> Traditionally, combat with [[Mob (computer gaming)|monsters]] and completing quests for [[non-player character]]s, either alone or in groups, are the primary ways to earn experience points. The accumulation of wealth (including combat-useful items) is also a way to progress in many MMORPGs. This is traditionally best accomplished via combat. The cycle produced by these conditions, combat leading to new items allowing for more combat with no change in gameplay, is sometimes pejoratively referred to as the [[Grinding (video gaming)|level treadmill]], or \"grinding\". The role-playing game ''[[Progress Quest]]'' was created as a parody of this trend. ''[[Eve Online]]'' trains skills in real time rather than using experience points as a measure of progression.\n\nIn some MMORPGs, there is no limit to a player's level, allowing the grinding experience to continue indefinitely. MMORPGs that use this model often glorify top ranked players by displaying their avatars on the game's website or posting their stats on a high score screen. Another common practice is to enforce a maximum reachable level for all players, often referred to as a level cap. Once reached, the definition of a player's progression changes. Instead of being awarded primarily with experience for completing quests and dungeons, the player's motivation to continue playing will be replaced with collecting money and equipment.\n\nOften, the widened range of equipment available at the maximum level will have increased aesthetic value to distinguish high ranking players in game between lower ranked players. Colloquially known as endgame gear, this set of empowered weapons and armor adds a competitive edge to both scripted boss encounters as well as player vs player combat. Player motivation to outperform others is fueled by acquiring such items and is a significant determining factor in their success or failure in combat-related situations.\n\n===Social interaction===\n{{Main|Social interaction via MMORPGs}}\nMMORPGs almost always have tools to facilitate communication between players. Many MMORPGs offer support for in-game [[clan (computer gaming)|guilds<span style=\"color:black\"> or </span>clans]], though these will usually form whether the game supports them or not.\n\nIn addition, most MMOGs require some degree of teamwork in parts of the game. These tasks usually require players to take on roles in the group, such as protecting other players from damage (called tanking), \"healing\" damage done to other players or damaging enemies.\n\nMMORPGs generally have Game Moderators or [[Game master|Game Masters]] (frequently referred to as GMs or \"mods\"), who may be paid employees or unpaid volunteers who attempt to supervise the world. Some GMs may have additional access to features and information related to the game that are not available to other players and roles.<ref>Nicholas, Munn J. \"The Reality of Friendship Within Immersive Virtual Worlds.\" Springer Science+Business Media (2011): 1-10. Web. 24 Oct. 2013.</ref>\n\nRelationships formed in MMORPGs can often be just as intense as relationships formed between friends or partners met outside the game, and often involve elements of collaboration and trust between players.<ref name=\"Yee_PDF\">{{cite book|last=R.Schroeder & A. Axelsson|others=Nicholas Yee|title=Avatars at Work and Play: Collaboration and Interaction in Shared Virtual Environments|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=London|date=2006|pages=187\u2013207|chapter=The Psychology of MMORPGs: Emotional Investment, Motivations, Relationship Formation, and Problematic Usage|isbn=1-4020-3883-6|url=http://www.nickyee.com/pubs/Yee%20-%20MMORPG%20Psychology%20(2006).pdf}}</ref><!-- alternate version/source of this journal:http://vhil.stanford.edu/pubs/2006/yee-psychology-mmorpg.pdf -->\n\n===Roleplaying===\nMost MMORPGs provide different types of classes that players can choose. Among those classes, a small portion of players choose to [[roleplay]] their characters, and there are rules that provide functionality and content to those who do. Community resources such as forums and guides exist in support of this play style.\n\nFor example, if a player wants to play a priest role in his MMORPG world, he might buy a [[cope]] from a shop and learn priestly skills, proceeding to speak, act, and interact with others as their character would. This may or may not include pursuing other goals such as wealth or experience. Guilds or similar groups with a focus on roleplaying may develop extended in-depth narratives using the setting and resources similar to those in the game world.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Culture===\n<!--This use of this image has no rationale on the image's page. Please read [[Wikipedia:NFCC#10c]] [[Image:Modified WoW User Interface.jpg|thumb|256px|A level 70 (currently the highest level attainable) character from ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', with a heavily modified user interface.]]-->\n\nOver time, the MMORPG community has developed a sub-culture with its own slang and metaphors, as well as an unwritten list of social rules and taboos. Players will often complain about 'grind' (a slang term for any repetitive, time-consuming activity in an MMORPG), or talk about 'buffs' and 'nerfs' (respectively an upgrade or downgrade of a particular game mechanic). <br />\n\nAs with all such cultures, social rules exist for such things as invitations to join an adventuring party, the proper division of treasure, and how a player is expected to behave while grouped with other players.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDebate rages in various gaming media over the long-term effect of [[video game overuse]].\n\n===System architecture===\nMost MMORPGs are deployed using a [[client\u2013server]] [[system architecture]]. The server software generates a [[Persistent world|persistent]] instance of the [[virtual world]] that runs continuously, and players connect to it via a client software. The client software may provide access to the entire playing world, or further 'expansions' may be required to be purchased to allow access to certain areas of the game. ''[[EverQuest]]'' and ''[[Guild Wars]]'' are two examples of games that use such a format. Players generally must purchase the client software for a one-time fee, although an increasing trend is for MMORPGs to work using pre-existing \"thin\" clients, such as a web browser.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nSome MMORPGs require payment or a monthly subscription to play. By definition, \"[[massively multiplayer]]\" games are always online, and most require some sort of continuous revenue (such as monthly subscriptions and advertisements) for maintenance and development purposes. Some games, such as ''[[Guild Wars]]'', have disposed of the 'monthly fee' model entirely, and recover costs directly through sales of the software and associated expansion packs. Still others adopt a micropayment model where the core content is free, but players are given the option to purchase additional content, such as equipment, aesthetic items, or pets. Games that make use of this model often have originated in Korea, such as ''[[Flyff]]'' and ''[[MapleStory]]''. This business model is alternately called \"[[pay for perks]]\" or \"[[freemium]]\", and games using it often describe themselves with the term \"[[free-to-play]]\".\n\nDepending on the number of players and the system architecture, an MMORPG might be run on multiple separate servers, each representing an independent world, where players from one server cannot interact with those from another; ''World of Warcraft'' is a prominent example, with each separate server housing several thousand players. In many MMORPGs the number of players in one world is often limited to around a few thousand, but a notable example of the opposite is ''[[EVE Online]]'', which accommodates several hundred thousand players on the same server, with over 60,000 playing simultaneously (June 2010<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eveonline.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&bid=771|title=This Weekend: The Alliance Tournament Finals!|access-date=2010-09-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218091807/http://www.eveonline.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&bid=771|archive-date=2015-02-18|url-status=dead}}</ref>) at certain times. Some games allow characters to appear on any world, but not simultaneously (such as ''Seal Online: Evolution''); others limit each character to the world in which it was created. ''World of Warcraft'' has experimented with \"cross-realm\" (i.e. cross-server) interaction in player vs player \"battlegrounds\", using server clusters or \"battlegroups\" to co-ordinate players looking to participate in structured player vs player content such as the Warsong Gulch or Alterac Valley battlegrounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/basics/battlegroups.html |title=World of Warcraft Europe -> Info -> Basics -> Battlegroups |date=5 April 2008 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405235302/http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/basics/battlegroups.html |archivedate=5 April 2008 }}</ref> Additionally, patch 3.3, released on December 8, 2009, introduced a cross-realm \"looking for group\" system to help players form groups for instanced content (though not for open-world questing) from a larger pool of characters than their home server can necessarily provide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wow-europe.com/en/patchnotes/|title=World of Warcraft|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:MUD1 screenshot.gif|thumb|right|350px|''[[MUD1]]'', an early multi-user game]]\n{{Main|History of massively multiplayer online role-playing games}}\nMMORPG is a term coined by [[Richard Garriott]] to refer to massive multiplayer online role-playing games and their social communities.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal |last=J\u00f8n |first=A.

Another milestone came in 1995 as [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET]] restrictions were lifted, opening the Internet up for game developers, which allowed for the first truly \"massively\"-scoped titles. Finally, MMORPGs as defined today began with ''[[Meridian 59]]'' in 1996, innovative both in its scope and in offering first-person 3D graphics, with ''[[The Realm Online]]'' appearing nearly simultaneously.<ref name=\"kostertimeline\" /> ''[[Ultima Online]]'', released in 1997, is often credited with first popularizing the genre,<ref name=\"kostertimeline\" /> though more mainstream attention was garnered by 1999's ''[[EverQuest]]'' and ''[[Asheron's Call]]'' in the West<ref name=\"kostertimeline\" /> and 1996's ''[[Nexus: The Kingdom of the Winds]]'' in South Korea.\n\nThe financial success of these early titles has ensured competition in the genre since that time. MMORPG titles now exist on [[video game console|consoles]] and in new settings. As of 2008, the market for MMORPGs has [[Blizzard Entertainment]]'s ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' dominating as the largest MMORPG,<ref>{{cite web |last =Snow |first =Blake |title =World of Warcraft addicts 10 million subscribers |publisher =GamePro.com |date =2008-01-23 |url =http://www.gamepro.com/news.cfm?article_id=157968 |accessdate =2008-06-15|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080128195245/http://www.gamepro.com/news.cfm?article_id=157968 |archivedate=2008-01-28}}</ref> alongside other titles such as ''[[Final Fantasy XIV]]'' and ''[[Guild Wars 2]]'', though an additional market exists for [[free-to-play]] MMORPGs, which are supported by advertising and purchases of in-game items. This free-to-play model is particularly common in [[South Korea]] such as ''[[MapleStory]]'', ''[[Rohan: Blood Feud]]'', and ''[[Atlantica Online]]''. Also, there are some free-to-play games, such as ''[[RuneScape]]'' and ''[[Tibia (computer game)|Tibia]]'', where the game is free, but one would have to pay monthly to play the game with more features. ''[[Guild Wars]]'' and its sequel avoid some degree of competition with other MMORPGs by only requiring the initial purchase of the game to play.\n\n==Development==\nThe cost of developing a competitive commercial MMORPG title often exceeded $10 million in 2003.<ref name=\"devcost\">Adam Carpenter (2003), Applying Risk-Based Analysis to Play Balance RPGs, Gamasutra, [http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2843/applying_risk_analysis_to_.php gamasutra.com]</ref> These projects require multiple disciplines within game design and development such as 3D modeling, 2D art, animation, user interfaces, client/server engineering, database architecture, and network infrastructure.<ref>Jon Radoff (2007), \"Anatomy of an MMORPG,\" '' PlayerVox,'' [http://radoff.com/blog/2008/08/22/anatomy-of-an-mmorpg/ radoff.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213053756/http://radoff.com/blog/2008/08/22/anatomy-of-an-mmorpg/ |date=2009-12-13 }}</ref>\n\nThe front-end (or client) component of a commercial, modern MMORPG features 3D graphics. As with other modern 3D games, the front-end requires expertise with implementing [[3D engine]]s, real-time [[shader]] techniques and physics simulation. The actual visual content (areas, creatures, characters, weapons, spaceships and so forth) is developed by artists who typically begin with two-dimensional concept art, and later convert these concepts into animated 3D scenes, models and texture maps.<ref name=\"3d game design\">Frank Luna (2006), \"3D Game Programming with DirectX 9.0c, a Shader Approach,\" Worldware Publishing, {{ISBN|1-59822-016-0}}</ref>\n\nDeveloping an MMOG server requires expertise with client/server architecture, network protocols, security, and database design. MMORPGs include reliable systems for a number of vital tasks. The server must be able to handle and verify a large number of connections, prevent [[cheating in online games|cheating]], and apply changes (bug fixes or added content) to the game. A system for recording the games data at regular intervals, without stopping the game, is also important.<ref name=\"game server\">Jay Lee (2003), Gamasutra, Relational Database Guidelines for MMOGs, [http://www.gamasutra.com/resource_guide/20030916/lee_01.shtml gamasutra.com]</ref>\n\nMaintenance requires sufficient [[server (computing)|server]]s and [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]], and a dedicated support staff. Insufficient resources for maintenance lead to [[lag]] and frustration for the players, and can severely damage the reputation of a game, especially at launch. Care must also be taken to ensure that player population remains at an acceptable level by adding or removing servers. [[Peer-to-peer]] MMORPGs could theoretically work cheaply and efficiently in regulating server load, but practical issues such as asymmetrical network bandwidth, CPU-hungry rendering engines, unreliability of individual nodes, and inherent lack of security (opening fertile new grounds for [[cheating in online games|cheating]]) can make them a difficult proposition. The hosted infrastructure for a commercial-grade MMORPG requires the deployment of hundreds (or even thousands) of servers. Developing an affordable infrastructure for an [[online game]] requires developers to scale large numbers of players with less hardware and network investment.<ref name=\"architecture\">GDC Proceedings 2005, Online Game Architecture: Back-End Strategies, [http://www.gamasutra.com/gdc2005/features/20050310/esbensen_01.shtml gamasutra.com]</ref>\n\nIn addition, the development team will need to have expertise with the fundamentals of game design: world-building, lore and game mechanics,<ref name=\"game fundamentals\">Chris Crawford (2003), Chris Crawford on Game Design, New Riders Games, {{ISBN|0-13-146099-4}}</ref> as well as what makes games fun.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Koster | first = Raph | authorlink = Raph Koster\n | title = A Theory of Fun for Game Design\n | publisher = Paraglyph Press\n | year = 2005\n | isbn = 1-932111-97-2\n}}</ref>\n\n===Non-corporate development===\n[[File:Ryzom screenshot 4.png|thumb|Screenshot of an event in the MMORPG ''[[Ryzom]]'', an [[open-source software|open source]] and [[free content]] game (2014).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/ryzom-free-software |title=Ryzom is free software!

As shown above, the average MMORPG development project requires enormous investments of time and money, and running the game can be a long-term commitment. As a result, non-corporate (or independent, or \"[[indie games|indie]]\") development of MMORPGs is less common compared to other genres. Still, many independent MMORPGs do exist, representing a wide spectrum of genres, gameplay types, and revenue systems.\n\n<!-- DO NOT ADD your favorite amateur development effort here without discussing it on the Talk page first.

The [[WorldForge]] project has been active since 1998 and formed a community of independent developers who are working on creating framework for a number of open-source MMORPGs.

Still, there are a few obvious developments. One of these developments is the [[raid (gaming)|raid]] group quest, or \"raid\",<ref name=\"raid trend\">{{cite web |url= http://www.mmorpg.com/showFeature.cfm/loadFeature/1028|title= Casual Play: Raiding Needs to Die|accessdate = 2007-05-02 |author= Wilson, Steve|date=December 14, 2006}}</ref> which is an adventure designed for large groups of players (often twenty or more).\n\n===Instance dungeons===\n[[Instance dungeons]], sometimes shortened to \"instances\", are game areas that are \"copied\" for individual players or groups, which keeps those in the instance separated from the rest of the game world. This reduces competition, and also reducing the amount of data that needs to be sent to and from the server, reducing lag. ''[[The Realm Online]]'' was the first MMORPG to begin to use a rudimentary form of this technique and ''[[Anarchy Online]]'' would develop it further, using instances as a key element of gameplay. Since then, instancing has become increasingly common. The \"raids\", as mentioned above, often involve instance dungeons. Examples of games which feature instances are ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'', ''[[EverQuest]]'', ''[[EverQuest II]]'', ''[[Aion: The Tower of Eternity|Aion]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy XIV (2010 video game)|Final Fantasy XIV]]'', ''[[Guild Wars (series)|Guild Wars]]'', ''[[Rift (video game)|Rift]]'', ''[[RuneScape]]'', ''[[Star Trek Online]]'' and ''[[DC Universe Online]]''.\n\n===Player-created content===\nIncreased amounts of \"[[User-generated content|player-created content]]\" is another trend.<ref name=\"player content trend\">Jon Radoff (March 20, 2007), Gamasutra, Five Prescriptions for Viral Games, [http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1693/five_prescriptions_for_viral_games.php gamasutra.com]</ref>\n\n===Use of licenses===\nThe use of [[intellectual property license|intellectual property licensing]] common in other video game genres has also appeared in MMORPGs. 2007 saw the release of ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'', based on [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]]. Other licensed MMORPGs include ''[[The Matrix Online]]'', based on the ''Matrix'' trilogy of films, ''[[Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning]]'', based on [[Games Workshop]]'s [[Warhammer Fantasy Battle|table top game]], ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', ''[[Star Wars The Old Republic]]'', ''[[Champions Online]]'' and ''[[Age of Conan]]''.\n\nAdditionally, several licenses from television have been optioned for MMORPGs, for example ''[[Star Trek Online]]'' and ''[[Stargate Worlds]]'' (which was later canceled).\n\n===Console-based MMORPGs===\nThe first console-based MMORPG was ''[[Phantasy Star Online]]'' for the [[Sega DreamCast]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/04/console-mmos-a-brief-history-of-one-mans-couch-laden-adventures/|title=Console MMOs: a brief history of one man's couch-laden adventures|access-date=2016-09-22}}</ref> The first console-based open-world MMORPG was ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'' for the [[PlayStation 2]].\n''[[EverQuest Online Adventures]]'', also on the PlayStation 2, was the first console MMORPG in North America.\nAlthough console-based MMORPGs are considered more difficult to produce,<ref name=\"no console mmo\">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=18768 | title = Analysis: Why Aren't There More Console MMOs?}}</ref> the platform is gaining more attention.\n\n===Browser-based MMORPGs===\nWith the popularization of Facebook and microtransactions has come a new wave of Flash and HTML5 based MMORPGs that use the free to play model. They require no download outside of a browser and usually have heavily integrated social media sharing features. Examples of browser-based MMORPG are here ''[[List_of_multiplayer_browser_games]]''.\n\n===Smartphone-based MMORPGs===\n[[Smartphone]]s with their [[GPS]] capabilities (amongst others) enable [[augmented reality]] in games such as ''[[Ingress (video game)|Ingress]]'' and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Go]]''. The games are enhanced by location and distance based tracking, bench marking goals or facilitating trade between players.\n\n==In society and culture==\n\n===Psychological effects===\n{{importance section|date=April 2014}}\nSince the interactions between MMORPG players are real, even if the environments are virtual, [[psychologist]]s and [[sociologist]]s are able to use MMORPGs as tools for academic research.

His classifications were then expanded upon by Erwin Andreasen, who developed the concept into the thirty-question [[Bartle Test]] that helps players determine which category they are associated with.

In ''[[Second Life]]'' and ''[[Entropia Universe]]'', the virtual economy and the real-world economy are directly linked. This means that real money can be deposited for game money and vice versa. Real-world items have also been sold for game money in ''Entropia'', and some players of ''Second Life'' have generated revenues in excess of $100,000.<ref name=\"SecondLifeEconomy\">{{cite magazine |url= http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_18/b3982001.htm|title= My Virtual Life |accessdate = 2007-05-16 |author= Hof, Robert|date= 2006-05-01|magazine= BusinessWeek}}</ref>\n\n[[File:RuneScape spammers.png|thumb|Bots spamming a communication channel in [[RuneScape]] to advertise illegitimate market websites.]]\n\nSome of the issues confronting online economies include:\n* The use of \"bots\" or automated programs, that assist some players in accumulating in-game wealth to the disadvantage of other players.<ref name=\"bots\">Robert Shapiro (2003), How online games teach us about economics, [http://www.slate.com/id/2078053/ slate.com]</ref>\n* The use of unsanctioned auction sites, which has led publishers to seek legal remedies to prevent their use based on intellectual-property claims.<ref name=\"stopauctions\">Blizzard Goes to War, [http://terranova.blogs.com/terra_nova/2004/12/blizzard_goes_t.html terranova.blogs.com]</ref>\n* The emergence of [[virtual crime]], which can take the form of both fraud against the player or publisher of an online game, and even real-life acts of violence stemming from in-game transactions.<ref>BBC News (2005), Game Theft led to Fatal Attack, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4397159.stm news.bbc.co.uk]</ref>\n\nLinking real-world and virtual economies is rare in MMORPGs, as it is generally believed to be detrimental to gameplay. If real-world wealth can be used to obtain greater, more immediate rewards than skillful gameplay, the incentive for strategic roleplay and real game involvement is diminished.

If it is a notable product or part of history, please add it to a later, appropriate section-->\n\n==Common features==\nAlthough modern MMORPGs sometimes differ dramatically from their predecessors, many of them share the same basic characteristics. These include several common features: persistent game environment, some form of level progression, social interaction within the game, in-game culture, system architecture, membership in a group, and character customization.\n\n===Themes===\nThe majority of popular MMORPGs are based on traditional [[fantasy]] themes, often occurring in an in-game universe comparable to that of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''. Some employ hybrid themes that either merge or replace fantasy elements with those of [[science fiction]], [[sword and sorcery]], or [[crime fiction]]. Others draw thematic material from [[American comic books]], the [[occult]], and other [[genre]]s. These elements are often developed using similar tasks and scenarios involving [[quest (gaming)|quests]], [[Mob (computer gaming)|monsters]], and [[looting (gaming)|loot]].\n\n===Progression===\nIn nearly all MMORPGs, the development of the [[player character|player's character]] is the primary goal. Nearly all MMORPGs feature a character progression system, in which players earn [[experience points]] for their actions and use those points to reach character \"levels\", which makes them better at whatever they do.<ref name=\"dog1\">{{cite book|last1=Mulligan|first1=Jessica|last2=Patrovsky|first2=Bridgette| year = 2003 | title = Developing Online Games: An Insider's Guide | publisher = New Riders | isbn = 1-59273-000-0 | pages = 474, 477| quote = [pp. 474] '''experience points''' A point value that is accumulated by gameplay activity such as '''leveling''' and is used as a measure of a character's power. Popularized by the classic dice version of TSR's ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' back in the 1970s and carried over to online gaming by designers. [pp. 477] '''level''' A rank or rating of a character's power. [...] '''leveling''' Activity in-game devoted to increasing a character's experience, level, and/or skills. Leveling usually consists of killing '''mobs'''.}}</ref> Traditionally, combat with [[Mob (computer gaming)|monsters]] and completing quests for [[non-player character]]s, either alone or in groups, are the primary ways to earn experience points. The accumulation of wealth (including combat-useful items) is also a way to progress in many MMORPGs. This is traditionally best accomplished via combat. The cycle produced by these conditions, combat leading to new items allowing for more combat with no change in gameplay, is sometimes pejoratively referred to as the [[Grinding (video gaming)|level treadmill]], or \"grinding\". The role-playing game ''[[Progress Quest]]'' was created as a parody of this trend. ''[[Eve Online]]'' trains skills in real time rather than using experience points as a measure of progression.\n\nIn some MMORPGs, there is no limit to a player's level, allowing the grinding experience to continue indefinitely. MMORPGs that use this model often glorify top ranked players by displaying their avatars on the game's website or posting their stats on a high score screen. Another common practice is to enforce a maximum reachable level for all players, often referred to as a level cap. Once reached, the definition of a player's progression changes. Instead of being awarded primarily with experience for completing quests and dungeons, the player's motivation to continue playing will be replaced with collecting money and equipment.\n\nOften, the widened range of equipment available at the maximum level will have increased aesthetic value to distinguish high ranking players in game between lower ranked players. Colloquially known as endgame gear, this set of empowered weapons and armor adds a competitive edge to both scripted boss encounters as well as player vs player combat. Player motivation to outperform others is fueled by acquiring such items and is a significant determining factor in their success or failure in combat-related situations.\n\n===Social interaction===\n{{Main|Social interaction via MMORPGs}}\nMMORPGs almost always have tools to facilitate communication between players. Many MMORPGs offer support for in-game [[clan (computer gaming)|guilds<span style=\"color:black\"> or </span>clans]], though these will usually form whether the game supports them or not.\n\nIn addition, most MMOGs require some degree of teamwork in parts of the game. These tasks usually require players to take on roles in the group, such as protecting other players from damage (called tanking), \"healing\" damage done to other players or damaging enemies.\n\nMMORPGs generally have Game Moderators or [[Game master|Game Masters]] (frequently referred to as GMs or \"mods\"), who may be paid employees or unpaid volunteers who attempt to supervise the world.

Among those classes, a small portion of players choose to [[roleplay]] their characters, and there are rules that provide functionality and content to those who do. Community resources such as forums and guides exist in support of this play style.\n\nFor example, if a player wants to play a priest role in his MMORPG world, he might buy a [[cope]] from a shop and learn priestly skills, proceeding to speak, act, and interact with others as their character would. This may or may not include pursuing other goals such as wealth or experience. Guilds or similar groups with a focus on roleplaying may develop extended in-depth narratives using the setting and resources similar to those in the game world.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Culture===\n<!--This use of this image has no rationale on the image's page. Please read [[Wikipedia:NFCC#10c]] [[Image:Modified WoW User Interface.jpg|thumb|256px|A level 70 (currently the highest level attainable) character from ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', with a heavily modified user interface.]]-->\n\nOver time, the MMORPG community has developed a sub-culture with its own slang and metaphors, as well as an unwritten list of social rules and taboos. Players will often complain about 'grind' (a slang term for any repetitive, time-consuming activity in an MMORPG), or talk about 'buffs' and 'nerfs' (respectively an upgrade or downgrade of a particular game mechanic). <br />\n\nAs with all such cultures, social rules exist for such things as invitations to join an adventuring party, the proper division of treasure, and how a player is expected to behave while grouped with other players.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDebate rages in various gaming media over the long-term effect of [[video game overuse]].\n\n===System architecture===\nMost MMORPGs are deployed using a [[client\u2013server]] [[system architecture]]. The server software generates a [[Persistent world|persistent]] instance of the [[virtual world]] that runs continuously, and players connect to it via a client software. The client software may provide access to the entire playing world, or further 'expansions' may be required to be purchased to allow access to certain areas of the game. ''[[EverQuest]]'' and ''[[Guild Wars]]'' are two examples of games that use such a format. Players generally must purchase the client software for a one-time fee, although an increasing trend is for MMORPGs to work using pre-existing \"thin\" clients, such as a web browser.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nSome MMORPGs require payment or a monthly subscription to play. By definition, \"[[massively multiplayer]]\" games are always online, and most require some sort of continuous revenue (such as monthly subscriptions and advertisements) for maintenance and development purposes. Some games, such as ''[[Guild Wars]]'', have disposed of the 'monthly fee' model entirely, and recover costs directly through sales of the software and associated expansion packs. Still others adopt a micropayment model where the core content is free, but players are given the option to purchase additional content, such as equipment, aesthetic items, or pets. Games that make use of this model often have originated in Korea, such as ''[[Flyff]]'' and ''[[MapleStory]]''. This business model is alternately called \"[[pay for perks]]\" or \"[[freemium]]\", and games using it often describe themselves with the term \"[[free-to-play]]\".\n\nDepending on the number of players and the system architecture, an MMORPG might be run on multiple separate servers, each representing an independent world, where players from one server cannot interact with those from another; ''World of Warcraft'' is a prominent example, with each separate server housing several thousand players. In many MMORPGs the number of players in one world is often limited to around a few thousand, but a notable example of the opposite is ''[[EVE Online]]'', which accommodates several hundred thousand players on the same server, with over 60,000 playing simultaneously (June 2010<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eveonline.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&bid=771|title=This Weekend: The Alliance Tournament Finals!|access-date=2010-09-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218091807/http://www.eveonline.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&bid=771|archive-date=2015-02-18|url-status=dead}}</ref>) at certain times. Some games allow characters to appear on any world, but not simultaneously (such as ''Seal Online: Evolution''); others limit each character to the world in which it was created. ''World of Warcraft'' has experimented with \"cross-realm\" (i.e. cross-server) interaction in player vs player \"battlegrounds\", using server clusters or \"battlegroups\" to co-ordinate players looking to participate in structured player vs player content such as the Warsong Gulch or Alterac Valley battlegrounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/basics/battlegroups.html |title=World of Warcraft Europe -> Info -> Basics -> Battlegroups |date=5 April 2008 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405235302/http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/basics/battlegroups.html |archivedate=5 April 2008 }}</ref> Additionally, patch 3.3, released on December 8, 2009, introduced a cross-realm \"looking for group\" system to help players form groups for instanced content (though not for open-world questing) from a larger pool of characters than their home server can necessarily provide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wow-europe.com/en/patchnotes/|title=World of Warcraft|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:MUD1 screenshot.gif|thumb|right|350px|''[[MUD1]]'', an early multi-user game]]\n{{Main|History of massively multiplayer online role-playing games}}\nMMORPG is a term coined by [[Richard Garriott]] to refer to massive multiplayer online role-playing games and their social communities.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal |last=J\u00f8n |first=A.

Another milestone came in 1995 as [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET]] restrictions were lifted, opening the Internet up for game developers, which allowed for the first truly \"massively\"-scoped titles. Finally, MMORPGs as defined today began with ''[[Meridian 59]]'' in 1996, innovative both in its scope and in offering first-person 3D graphics, with ''[[The Realm Online]]'' appearing nearly simultaneously.<ref name=\"kostertimeline\" /> ''[[Ultima Online]]'', released in 1997, is often credited with first popularizing the genre,<ref name=\"kostertimeline\" /> though more mainstream attention was garnered by 1999's ''[[EverQuest]]'' and ''[[Asheron's Call]]'' in the West<ref name=\"kostertimeline\" /> and 1996's ''[[Nexus: The Kingdom of the Winds]]'' in South Korea.\n\nThe financial success of these early titles has ensured competition in the genre since that time. MMORPG titles now exist on [[video game console|consoles]] and in new settings. As of 2008, the market for MMORPGs has [[Blizzard Entertainment]]'s ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' dominating as the largest MMORPG,<ref>{{cite web |last =Snow |first =Blake |title =World of Warcraft addicts 10 million subscribers |publisher =GamePro.com |date =2008-01-23 |url =http://www.gamepro.com/news.cfm?article_id=157968 |accessdate =2008-06-15|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080128195245/http://www.gamepro.com/news.cfm?article_id=157968 |archivedate=2008-01-28}}</ref> alongside other titles such as ''[[Final Fantasy XIV]]'' and ''[[Guild Wars 2]]'', though an additional market exists for [[free-to-play]] MMORPGs, which are supported by advertising and purchases of in-game items. This free-to-play model is particularly common in [[South Korea]] such as ''[[MapleStory]]'', ''[[Rohan: Blood Feud]]'', and ''[[Atlantica Online]]''. Also, there are some free-to-play games, such as ''[[RuneScape]]'' and ''[[Tibia (computer game)|Tibia]]'', where the game is free, but one would have to pay monthly to play the game with more features. ''[[Guild Wars]]'' and its sequel avoid some degree of competition with other MMORPGs by only requiring the initial purchase of the game to play.\n\n==Development==\nThe cost of developing a competitive commercial MMORPG title often exceeded $10 million in 2003.<ref name=\"devcost\">Adam Carpenter (2003), Applying Risk-Based Analysis to Play Balance RPGs, Gamasutra, [http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2843/applying_risk_analysis_to_.php gamasutra.com]</ref> These projects require multiple disciplines within game design and development such as 3D modeling, 2D art, animation, user interfaces, client/server engineering, database architecture, and network infrastructure.<ref>Jon Radoff (2007), \"Anatomy of an MMORPG,\" '' PlayerVox,'' [http://radoff.com/blog/2008/08/22/anatomy-of-an-mmorpg/ radoff.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213053756/http://radoff.com/blog/2008/08/22/anatomy-of-an-mmorpg/ |date=2009-12-13 }}</ref>\n\nThe front-end (or client) component of a commercial, modern MMORPG features 3D graphics. As with other modern 3D games, the front-end requires expertise with implementing [[3D engine]]s, real-time [[shader]] techniques and physics simulation. The actual visual content (areas, creatures, characters, weapons, spaceships and so forth) is developed by artists who typically begin with two-dimensional concept art, and later convert these concepts into animated 3D scenes, models and texture maps.<ref name=\"3d game design\">Frank Luna (2006), \"3D Game Programming with DirectX 9.0c, a Shader Approach,\" Worldware Publishing, {{ISBN|1-59822-016-0}}</ref>\n\nDeveloping an MMOG server requires expertise with client/server architecture, network protocols, security, and database design. MMORPGs include reliable systems for a number of vital tasks. The server must be able to handle and verify a large number of connections, prevent [[cheating in online games|cheating]], and apply changes (bug fixes or added content) to the game. A system for recording the games data at regular intervals, without stopping the game, is also important.<ref name=\"game server\">Jay Lee (2003), Gamasutra, Relational Database Guidelines for MMOGs, [http://www.gamasutra.com/resource_guide/20030916/lee_01.shtml gamasutra.com]</ref>\n\nMaintenance requires sufficient [[server (computing)|server]]s and [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]], and a dedicated support staff. Insufficient resources for maintenance lead to [[lag]] and frustration for the players, and can severely damage the reputation of a game, especially at launch. Care must also be taken to ensure that player population remains at an acceptable level by adding or removing servers. [[Peer-to-peer]] MMORPGs could theoretically work cheaply and efficiently in regulating server load, but practical issues such as asymmetrical network bandwidth, CPU-hungry rendering engines, unreliability of individual nodes, and inherent lack of security (opening fertile new grounds for [[cheating in online games|cheating]]) can make them a difficult proposition. The hosted infrastructure for a commercial-grade MMORPG requires the deployment of hundreds (or even thousands) of servers. Developing an affordable infrastructure for an [[online game]] requires developers to scale large numbers of players with less hardware and network investment.<ref name=\"architecture\">GDC Proceedings 2005, Online Game Architecture: Back-End Strategies, [http://www.gamasutra.com/gdc2005/features/20050310/esbensen_01.shtml gamasutra.com]</ref>\n\nIn addition, the development team will need to have expertise with the fundamentals of game design: world-building, lore and game mechanics,<ref name=\"game fundamentals\">Chris Crawford (2003), Chris Crawford on Game Design, New Riders Games, {{ISBN|0-13-146099-4}}</ref> as well as what makes games fun.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Koster | first = Raph | authorlink = Raph Koster\n | title = A Theory of Fun for Game Design\n | publisher = Paraglyph Press\n | year = 2005\n | isbn = 1-932111-97-2\n}}</ref>\n\n===Non-corporate development===\n[[File:Ryzom screenshot 4.png|thumb|Screenshot of an event in the MMORPG ''[[Ryzom]]'', an [[open-source software|open source]] and [[free content]] game (2014).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/ryzom-free-software |title=Ryzom is free software!

As shown above, the average MMORPG development project requires enormous investments of time and money, and running the game can be a long-term commitment. As a result, non-corporate (or independent, or \"[[indie games|indie]]\") development of MMORPGs is less common compared to other genres. Still, many independent MMORPGs do exist, representing a wide spectrum of genres, gameplay types, and revenue systems.\n\n<!-- DO NOT ADD your favorite amateur development effort here without discussing it on the Talk page first.

The [[WorldForge]] project has been active since 1998 and formed a community of independent developers who are working on creating framework for a number of open-source MMORPGs. The [[Multiverse Foundation]] has also created a platform specifically for independent MMOG developers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.multiversemmo.com/viewpage.php?page_id=4|title=About Multiverse|accessdate=12 April 2014|publisher=[[Multiverse]]}}</ref>\n\n==Trends==\nAs there are a number of wildly different titles within the genre, and since the genre develops so rapidly, it is difficult to definitively state that the genre is heading in one direction or another. Still, there are a few obvious developments. One of these developments is the [[raid (gaming)|raid]] group quest, or \"raid\",<ref name=\"raid trend\">{{cite web |url= http://www.mmorpg.com/showFeature.cfm/loadFeature/1028|title= Casual Play: Raiding Needs to Die|accessdate = 2007-05-02 |author= Wilson, Steve|date=December 14, 2006}}</ref> which is an adventure designed for large groups of players (often twenty or more).\n\n===Instance dungeons===\n[[Instance dungeons]], sometimes shortened to \"instances\", are game areas that are \"copied\" for individual players or groups, which keeps those in the instance separated from the rest of the game world. This reduces competition, and also reducing the amount of data that needs to be sent to and from the server, reducing lag. ''[[The Realm Online]]'' was the first MMORPG to begin to use a rudimentary form of this technique and ''[[Anarchy Online]]'' would develop it further, using instances as a key element of gameplay. Since then, instancing has become increasingly common. The \"raids\", as mentioned above, often involve instance dungeons. Examples of games which feature instances are ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'', ''[[EverQuest]]'', ''[[EverQuest II]]'', ''[[Aion: The Tower of Eternity|Aion]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy XIV (2010 video game)|Final Fantasy XIV]]'', ''[[Guild Wars (series)|Guild Wars]]'', ''[[Rift (video game)|Rift]]'', ''[[RuneScape]]'', ''[[Star Trek Online]]'' and ''[[DC Universe Online]]''.\n\n===Player-created content===\nIncreased amounts of \"[[User-generated content|player-created content]]\" is another trend.<ref name=\"player content trend\">Jon Radoff (March 20, 2007), Gamasutra, Five Prescriptions for Viral Games, [http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1693/five_prescriptions_for_viral_games.php gamasutra.com]</ref>\n\n===Use of licenses===\nThe use of [[intellectual property license|intellectual property licensing]] common in other video game genres has also appeared in MMORPGs. 2007 saw the release of ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'', based on [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]]. Other licensed MMORPGs include ''[[The Matrix Online]]'', based on the ''Matrix'' trilogy of films, ''[[Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning]]'', based on [[Games Workshop]]'s [[Warhammer Fantasy Battle|table top game]], ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', ''[[Star Wars The Old Republic]]'', ''[[Champions Online]]'' and ''[[Age of Conan]]''.\n\nAdditionally, several licenses from television have been optioned for MMORPGs, for example ''[[Star Trek Online]]'' and ''[[Stargate Worlds]]'' (which was later canceled).\n\n===Console-based MMORPGs===\nThe first console-based MMORPG was ''[[Phantasy Star Online]]'' for the [[Sega DreamCast]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/04/console-mmos-a-brief-history-of-one-mans-couch-laden-adventures/|title=Console MMOs: a brief history of one man's couch-laden adventures|access-date=2016-09-22}}</ref> The first console-based open-world MMORPG was ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'' for the [[PlayStation 2]].\n''[[EverQuest Online Adventures]]'', also on the PlayStation 2, was the first console MMORPG in North America.\nAlthough console-based MMORPGs are considered more difficult to produce,<ref name=\"no console mmo\">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=18768 | title = Analysis: Why Aren't There More Console MMOs?}}</ref> the platform is gaining more attention.\n\n===Browser-based MMORPGs===\nWith the popularization of Facebook and microtransactions has come a new wave of Flash and HTML5 based MMORPGs that use the free to play model. They require no download outside of a browser and usually have heavily integrated social media sharing features. Examples of browser-based MMORPG are here ''[[List_of_multiplayer_browser_games]]''.\n\n===Smartphone-based MMORPGs===\n[[Smartphone]]s with their [[GPS]] capabilities (amongst others) enable [[augmented reality]] in games such as ''[[Ingress (video game)|Ingress]]'' and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Go]]''. The games are enhanced by location and distance based tracking, bench marking goals or facilitating trade between players.\n\n==In society and culture==\n\n===Psychological effects===\n{{importance section|date=April 2014}}\nSince the interactions between MMORPG players are real, even if the environments are virtual, [[psychologist]]s and [[sociologist]]s are able to use MMORPGs as tools for academic research.

In ''[[Second Life]]'' and ''[[Entropia Universe]]'', the virtual economy and the real-world economy are directly linked. This means that real money can be deposited for game money and vice versa. Real-world items have also been sold for game money in ''Entropia'', and some players of ''Second Life'' have generated revenues in excess of $100,000.<ref name=\"SecondLifeEconomy\">{{cite magazine |url= http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_18/b3982001.htm|title= My Virtual Life |accessdate = 2007-05-16 |author= Hof, Robert|date= 2006-05-01|magazine= BusinessWeek}}</ref>\n\n[[File:RuneScape spammers.png|thumb|Bots spamming a communication channel in [[RuneScape]] to advertise illegitimate market websites.]]\n\nSome of the issues confronting online economies include:\n* The use of \"bots\" or automated programs, that assist some players in accumulating in-game wealth to the disadvantage of other players.<ref name=\"bots\">Robert Shapiro (2003), How online games teach us about economics, [http://www.slate.com/id/2078053/ slate.com]</ref>\n* The use of unsanctioned auction sites, which has led publishers to seek legal remedies to prevent their use based on intellectual-property claims.<ref name=\"stopauctions\">Blizzard Goes to War, [http://terranova.blogs.com/terra_nova/2004/12/blizzard_goes_t.html terranova.blogs.com]</ref>\n* The emergence of [[virtual crime]], which can take the form of both fraud against the player or publisher of an online game, and even real-life acts of violence stemming from in-game transactions.<ref>BBC News (2005), Game Theft led to Fatal Attack, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4397159.stm news.bbc.co.uk]</ref>\n\nLinking real-world and virtual economies is rare in MMORPGs, as it is generally believed to be detrimental to gameplay. If real-world wealth can be used to obtain greater, more immediate rewards than skillful gameplay, the incentive for strategic roleplay and real game involvement is diminished.

The game features much of the gameplay of [[Age of Empires|the series]], with the addition of a [[massively multiplayer online game|massive multiplayer online gaming]] element. The player possesses a capital city for each started civilization, that continues to exist when the player is offline. Also, the game features a great quantity of new content, such as the ability to craft items with earned materials and trading with other players.<ref name=\"features\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ageofempiresonline.com/en/features|title=General Features|publisher=Age of Empires Online website|accessdate=September 6, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920171542/http://ageofempiresonline.com/en/features|archive-date=September 20, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe main gameplay revolved around the player developing a civilization from its birth to its peak and fall. To assure victory, the player had to gather and preserve resources to spend on new units, buildings and more advanced technology.\n\nCivilian units, called ''villagers'', were used to gather resources (hunting, fishing, farming, forestry, mining etc.).. Resources could be traded, and also \"spent\" to train units, construct buildings, and research technologies.\n\n===Units===\n''Age of Empires Online'' includes five classes of military units: Infantry, archers, cavalry, [[siege]] weaponry, and [[navy|naval]] units. All military classes are developed to maintain a balance on gameplay, and thus avoiding visible advantages between civilizations. As an example, a unit powerful against buildings can be weak against a certain kind of cavalry. Unique units are available for the Greek, Egyptian, Celts, and Persian civilizations, either from the start of the game or through advisor cards. These civilization-specific units are generally more powerful, but can still be vulnerable to certain units. The [[priest]] is a special kind of military unit that has the ability to convert enemy units to the player's civilization, and to heal allied units.<ref name=\"ageofempiresonline\">{{cite web |url=http://ageofempiresonline.com/en/features |title=Features |publisher=Age of Empires Online |accessdate=October 19, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018141503/http://ageofempiresonline.com/en/features |archive-date=October 18, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nEvery player has a limit to the total number of units they can create\u2014a population limit\u2014but may not immediately use the entire potential population. The population limit increases with the number of houses or town centers in the player's village to a maximum of 200, with each house contributing five (or ten for the Norse) and each town center contributing 20 to the limit. There are two important features for unit management: The idle villager button, which helps players identify villagers that have not been assigned a task, and the town bell, which sends all of the player's villagers into the nearest town center, fortress or tower for safety.<ref name=\"ageofempiresonline\" />\n\n===Buildings===\nThe buildings in ''Age of Empires Online'' are either economic or military buildings. Buildings can research technologies and upgrades that increase economic, military or unit-based efficiency, as well as provide resources for the player. Each civilization has unique buildings, but some are common for all civilizations; the most important of these being the town center, where villagers are created, resources are stored, some technologies researched and in which the player can advance to the next age. The town center can fire arrows at enemy units within range. Other economic buildings available include the storehouse for resources, farms, docks (the dock may also produce several military ships), and houses to support a higher population.\n\nMilitary buildings include unit-producing buildings such as [[barracks]], archery ranges, stables, and fortresses, as well as defensive buildings such as walls and towers. Military buildings can perform research to improve the abilities of military units, increasing their strength, defensive capabilities, or other attributes. The fortress is a powerful defensive building which can train a variety of units, including the civilization's unique units, and fires arrows at enemy units within range. It can only be built after a player has reached the third age. There are two other important defensive buildings: Walls and towers. Walls are used to prevent access for enemy units to an enclosed area, while friendly units can traverse the walls through inserted gates. Towers are equipped with the ability to fire arrows at enemy units, or garrison friendly units for protection, and can be used in conjunction with walls in establishing defense lines. Watch posts are used for extendings the line of sight.\n\n===Capital city===\nThe capital city is similar to the \"Home city\" concept implemented in ''[[Age of Empires III]]''. The city functions as the player's home base for their civilization. It continues to exist even when the player logs out of the game, though it cannot be attacked or altered by other players. Through the capital city, the player can manage quests, improve technologies, send mail, craft items, participate in player to player trade, acquire and equip new gear for individual units, and visit other player's cities. Stores built within the city can be visited by other players and currency used for the items purchased will add to the player's funds. Unlike the home city from ''Age of Empires III'' where you can only customize the look of buildings, the capital city is completely customizable; buildings and rewards can be placed anywhere on the city map as the player chooses. Players can add buildings, rewards, houses as well as statues and bushes along with other things to decorate their capital city. \"Vanity Island\" exist to add new bushes and statues for the player to use to decorate their capital city. The city is also used as a gateway to other AI controlled cities within the region, where a player can visit and acquire new quests and items. The capital city also has many different buildings that the player can build. Craft schools, built from the city, produce gear and consumables for the player to use. Additionally, Microsoft released a crafting app for [[Windows Phone]] which a player can use to assist in crafting within the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/crafting-guide/bf135187-f944-4947-bf36-f94b8d46f6e4 |title=Crafting Guide &#124; Windows Phone Apps+Games Store (United States) |publisher=Windowsphone.com |accessdate=January 19, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111005149/http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/crafting-guide/bf135187-f944-4947-bf36-f94b8d46f6e4 |archive-date=November 11, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Quests===\nQuests are the main [[PvE]] aspect of the game. Quests generally involve fighting and defeating the AI player. They are similar to the campaigns in previous ''[[Age of Empires]]'' games. They are completed when the objectives are met. Objectives in quests vary greatly, some quests involve defeating enemies, others involve protecting a building or unit, and some involve collecting a certain amount of resources while defending from the enemy. Quest rewards include experience points, gold, empire points, chests, and sometimes gear.  Certain quests also have a co-op option, which allows the player to do the quest with another player to help them. Certain quests also have an \"elite\" version, which allows for the player to gain a greater amount of rewards, but is more difficult presenting the player with a greater challenge.\n\nThe different civilizations also have different quest lines, e.g. the Celts have 80 unique quests that the other civilizations do not possess.<ref name=\"SpringPatchNotes\">{{cite web|url=http://ageofempiresonline.com/en/articles/blog-20120327|title=Blog post: Spring Patch notes|publisher=Age of Empires Online website|date=March 27, 2012|accessdate=September 6, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116155857/http://ageofempiresonline.com/en/articles/blog-20120327|archive-date=November 16, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===PvP===\nPlayer versus player, or [[Player versus player|PvP]], is another aspect of the game. PvP in this game can be started in one of two ways: By using Sparta PvP to find a random match, or by using the arena in the capital city to play against a party member. Sparta PvP can be accessed by visiting the Sparta region in the world map. In Sparta PvP, there are two different types of PvP options. Standard PvP is the first option and allows the player to use star techs from their tech-tree as well as any gear and advisors that they have equipped in their capital city. This PvP option was first to be released. Champion mode PvP is the second Sparta PvP option. This is also sometimes known as ranked PvP while Standard PvP is known as unranked PvP. In this PvP option all gears, star techs and advisors are disabled and cannot be used to start the players off at an even footing. All gears equipped will provide the units with a cosmetic change but will not affect their stats like they would normally do in PvE missions.<ref name=\"features\" />\n\nIn Sparta PvP, the player starts off with a minimal amount of resources, a few villagers and their scout. Map selection is random and cannot be chosen by either players. Champion mode PvP results will also determine your [[TrueSkill]] ranking which is used to determine a player's rank globally as well as to help find the player a match and opponents for PvP. Currently, in Sparta PvP, there is an option for 1v1 PvP and 2v2 PvP. Rewards from Sparta PvP include experience points, empire points, gold and Sparta points which can be used in the stores in Sparta for chests, gear and consumables.\n\nPvP is also accessible through the Arena in the player's capital city. While identical to Sparta PvP in many ways, Arena PvP can differ in many ways. In Arena PvP, you can play against any human opponent in your party as well as choose the map and teams (if it is a 2v2 match) before starting the game. Arena PvP  will not affect your Sparta PvP Trueskill ranking. Finally, arena PvP also does not provide any rewards to the winning player. The August 2012 update also added a new spectator mode option for Arena PvP<ref name=\"AnniversaryUpdate\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ageofempiresonline.com/en/articles/blog-20120814-2|title=Blog post: Anniversary Update - Design Notes|publisher=Age of Empires Online website|date=August 14, 2012|accessdate=September 6, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817225606/http://www.ageofempiresonline.com/en/articles/blog-20120814-2|archive-date=August 17, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and the October 2012 update made Arena PvP (Standard or Champion mode) free for all players.<ref name=\"ageofempiresonline2\">{{cite web |author=GPG Design Team |url=http://ageofempiresonline.com/en/articles/blog-20121022 |title=Blog |publisher=Age of Empires Online |date=October 22, 2012 |accessdate=January 19, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024231553/http://ageofempiresonline.com/en/articles/blog-20121022 |archive-date=October 24, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Civilizations===\nSix [[civilization]]s are available.

Robot was hired by Microsoft to develop the game over a 24-month period. The entire studio team focused on it as their sole project, in an effort to earn startup funds for Robot's future projects.<ref name=\"Robot\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2012/04/18/interview-patrick-hudson-robot-entertainment.aspx|title=Director's Cut: Interview With Robot Entertainment's Patrick Hudson|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=April 18, 2012|accessdate=April 30, 2012|first=Matt|last=Helgeson|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422063546/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2012/04/18/interview-patrick-hudson-robot-entertainment.aspx|archive-date=April 22, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nDuring early production, ''Age of Empires Online'' was originally called ''Age of Empires IV''. The development team had noticed that many other RTS game developers had moved away from the \"economic game\". The team felt that ''[[Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings]]'' had blended the economic and military aspects of the game perfectly, so they decided to play test it with hindsight. They noticed that many features had been lost or changed over time. It was during this time the team decided to do an \"''Age of Kings'' style gameplay in an ''[[Age of Empires (video game)|Age of Empires]]'' setting\". The designers were surprised that fans of the series were most fond of the simpler aspects of the previous titles. Former ''Age of Empires II'' lead designer Ian M. Fischer stated, \"When we started floating some of the early [AoEO] out to people other pieces fell into place \u2013 I cannot tell you how many times I have had someone email me or talk to me at a show and mention how much they loved the villagers carrying big hunks of meat in the original Age or the priest \"wololo\"\". From that point on, one of the goals was to invoke nostalgia from fans of the series when playing the game, despite the newer and updated features.<ref name=\"Earlydesign\">{{cite web|url=http://www.robotentertainment.com/blog/detail/Hi-Honey-Were-Home|title=Hi Honey, We're Home|publisher=[[Robot Entertainment]]|date=August 27, 2010|accessdate=April 27, 2012|last=Fischer|first=Ian M.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301120444/http://www.robotentertainment.com/blog/detail/Hi-Honey-Were-Home|archive-date=March 1, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe decision to make the game online-only was based in part on the success of ''Age of Empires II'' and the popularity of its online integration with [[MSN Gaming Zone]]. Since online player interaction through the game was made a priority by the studio, two iterations of the game had to be created; a server version and a client version. This resulted in a heavily modified version of the BANG engine used in previous games of the series, along with requiring large amounts of additional server code and infrastructure to be implemented. Excluding the tools, ''Age of Empires Online'' contains over 1.2 million lines of code.<ref name=\"Gamedesign\">{{cite web|url=http://www.robotentertainment.com/blog/detail/Brief-History-Time-And-Age-Engine|title=A Brief History of Time (And the Age Engine)|publisher=[[Robot Entertainment]]|date=September 10, 2010|accessdate=April 27, 2012|last=Fermier|first=Rob|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914080956/http://www.robotentertainment.com/blog/detail/Brief-History-Time-and-Age-Engine|archive-date=September 14, 2010|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn designing the new look for the game, Robot had six artists come together to create a new art style which would look similar to the previous games from the series, yet look more \"visually appealing\", \"timeless\", and \"bright\". Among the art team was Ensemble Studios' first artist Brad Crow, who had worked on every ''Age of Empires'' game produced by the studio. The team implemented several ideas to give the game an improved core visual interface over that of its predecessors such as; increasing the field of view so that the player was able to see more on the screen, a tighter user interface to allow more of the field of play to be visible, a new building design to make them encompass less screen space &mdash; while also making them look more recognizable, and giving each unit a unique look and animation making them more easily distinguishable from each other.<ref name=\"Artdesign\" />\n\nThe music and sound for the game was developed by GL33k and veteran video game composer [[Chris Rickwood]]. In composing the music, Rickwood strove to keep it in the spirit of [[Stephen Rippy|Stephen Rippy's]] and Kevin McMullan's work from the prior games of the series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gl33k.com/consolepc/2011/8/15/age-of-empires-online.html |title=GL33k Game Audio - Console/PC - Age Of Empires Online |publisher=Gl33k.com |date=August 15, 2011 |accessdate=January 19, 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130216041439/http://gl33k.com/consolepc/2011/8/15/age-of-empires-online.html |archive-date=February 16, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn February 24, 2011, it was announced - first via [[Chris Taylor (game designer)|Chris Taylor]]'s Facebook page - that [[Gas Powered Games]] had taken over development from Robot Entertainment.

The game was published by [[Microsoft]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/2010/aug10/08-16msgamescompcpr.aspx|title=Microsoft Heralds a New Age of Gaming With \"Age of Empires Online\"|publisher=Microsoft website|date=August 16, 2010|accessdate=September 6, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621112909/http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/2010/aug10/08-16MSGamescomPCPR.aspx|archive-date=June 21, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe game was [[free-to-play]]\u2014it was free for users to play, though premium content could be earned or purchased, such as access to special items and blueprints, and more quests and features.\n\nOn March 27, 2012, the game premiered on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] after a major overhaul patch which addressed complaints of an \"MMO-like grind\" and many other features, along with the debut of the [[Celts|Celtic]] civilization.

The game features much of the gameplay of [[Age of Empires|the series]], with the addition of a [[massively multiplayer online game|massive multiplayer online gaming]] element. The player possesses a capital city for each started civilization, that continues to exist when the player is offline. Also, the game features a great quantity of new content, such as the ability to craft items with earned materials and trading with other players.<ref name=\"features\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ageofempiresonline.com/en/features|title=General Features|publisher=Age of Empires Online website|accessdate=September 6, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920171542/http://ageofempiresonline.com/en/features|archive-date=September 20, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe main gameplay revolved around the player developing a civilization from its birth to its peak and fall. To assure victory, the player had to gather and preserve resources to spend on new units, buildings and more advanced technology.\n\nCivilian units, called ''villagers'', were used to gather resources (hunting, fishing, farming, forestry, mining etc.).. Resources could be traded, and also \"spent\" to train units, construct buildings, and research technologies.\n\n===Units===\n''Age of Empires Online'' includes five classes of military units: Infantry, archers, cavalry, [[siege]] weaponry, and [[navy|naval]] units. All military classes are developed to maintain a balance on gameplay, and thus avoiding visible advantages between civilizations. As an example, a unit powerful against buildings can be weak against a certain kind of cavalry. Unique units are available for the Greek, Egyptian, Celts, and Persian civilizations, either from the start of the game or through advisor cards. These civilization-specific units are generally more powerful, but can still be vulnerable to certain units. The [[priest]] is a special kind of military unit that has the ability to convert enemy units to the player's civilization, and to heal allied units.<ref name=\"ageofempiresonline\">{{cite web |url=http://ageofempiresonline.com/en/features |title=Features |publisher=Age of Empires Online |accessdate=October 19, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018141503/http://ageofempiresonline.com/en/features |archive-date=October 18, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nEvery player has a limit to the total number of units they can create\u2014a population limit\u2014but may not immediately use the entire potential population. The population limit increases with the number of houses or town centers in the player's village to a maximum of 200, with each house contributing five (or ten for the Norse) and each town center contributing 20 to the limit. There are two important features for unit management: The idle villager button, which helps players identify villagers that have not been assigned a task, and the town bell, which sends all of the player's villagers into the nearest town center, fortress or tower for safety.<ref name=\"ageofempiresonline\" />\n\n===Buildings===\nThe buildings in ''Age of Empires Online'' are either economic or military buildings. Buildings can research technologies and upgrades that increase economic, military or unit-based efficiency, as well as provide resources for the player. Each civilization has unique buildings, but some are common for all civilizations; the most important of these being the town center, where villagers are created, resources are stored, some technologies researched and in which the player can advance to the next age. The town center can fire arrows at enemy units within range. Other economic buildings available include the storehouse for resources, farms, docks (the dock may also produce several military ships), and houses to support a higher population.\n\nMilitary buildings include unit-producing buildings such as [[barracks]], archery ranges, stables, and fortresses, as well as defensive buildings such as walls and towers. Military buildings can perform research to improve the abilities of military units, increasing their strength, defensive capabilities, or other attributes. The fortress is a powerful defensive building which can train a variety of units, including the civilization's unique units, and fires arrows at enemy units within range. It can only be built after a player has reached the third age. There are two other important defensive buildings: Walls and towers. Walls are used to prevent access for enemy units to an enclosed area, while friendly units can traverse the walls through inserted gates. Towers are equipped with the ability to fire arrows at enemy units, or garrison friendly units for protection, and can be used in conjunction with walls in establishing defense lines. Watch posts are used for extendings the line of sight.\n\n===Capital city===\nThe capital city is similar to the \"Home city\" concept implemented in ''[[Age of Empires III]]''. The city functions as the player's home base for their civilization. It continues to exist even when the player logs out of the game, though it cannot be attacked or altered by other players. Through the capital city, the player can manage quests, improve technologies, send mail, craft items, participate in player to player trade, acquire and equip new gear for individual units, and visit other player's cities. Stores built within the city can be visited by other players and currency used for the items purchased will add to the player's funds. Unlike the home city from ''Age of Empires III'' where you can only customize the look of buildings, the capital city is completely customizable; buildings and rewards can be placed anywhere on the city map as the player chooses. Players can add buildings, rewards, houses as well as statues and bushes along with other things to decorate their capital city. \"Vanity Island\" exist to add new bushes and statues for the player to use to decorate their capital city. The city is also used as a gateway to other AI controlled cities within the region, where a player can visit and acquire new quests and items. The capital city also has many different buildings that the player can build. Craft schools, built from the city, produce gear and consumables for the player to use. Additionally, Microsoft released a crafting app for [[Windows Phone]] which a player can use to assist in crafting within the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/crafting-guide/bf135187-f944-4947-bf36-f94b8d46f6e4 |title=Crafting Guide &#124; Windows Phone Apps+Games Store (United States) |publisher=Windowsphone.com |accessdate=January 19, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111005149/http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/crafting-guide/bf135187-f944-4947-bf36-f94b8d46f6e4 |archive-date=November 11, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Quests===\nQuests are the main [[PvE]] aspect of the game. Quests generally involve fighting and defeating the AI player. They are similar to the campaigns in previous ''[[Age of Empires]]'' games. They are completed when the objectives are met. Objectives in quests vary greatly, some quests involve defeating enemies, others involve protecting a building or unit, and some involve collecting a certain amount of resources while defending from the enemy. Quest rewards include experience points, gold, empire points, chests, and sometimes gear.  Certain quests also have a co-op option, which allows the player to do the quest with another player to help them. Certain quests also have an \"elite\" version, which allows for the player to gain a greater amount of rewards, but is more difficult presenting the player with a greater challenge.\n\nThe different civilizations also have different quest lines, e.g. the Celts have 80 unique quests that the other civilizations do not possess.<ref name=\"SpringPatchNotes\">{{cite web|url=http://ageofempiresonline.com/en/articles/blog-20120327|title=Blog post: Spring Patch notes|publisher=Age of Empires Online website|date=March 27, 2012|accessdate=September 6, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116155857/http://ageofempiresonline.com/en/articles/blog-20120327|archive-date=November 16, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===PvP===\nPlayer versus player, or [[Player versus player|PvP]], is another aspect of the game. PvP in this game can be started in one of two ways: By using Sparta PvP to find a random match, or by using the arena in the capital city to play against a party member. Sparta PvP can be accessed by visiting the Sparta region in the world map. In Sparta PvP, there are two different types of PvP options. Standard PvP is the first option and allows the player to use star techs from their tech-tree as well as any gear and advisors that they have equipped in their capital city. This PvP option was first to be released. Champion mode PvP is the second Sparta PvP option. This is also sometimes known as ranked PvP while Standard PvP is known as unranked PvP. In this PvP option all gears, star techs and advisors are disabled and cannot be used to start the players off at an even footing. All gears equipped will provide the units with a cosmetic change but will not affect their stats like they would normally do in PvE missions.<ref name=\"features\" />\n\nIn Sparta PvP, the player starts off with a minimal amount of resources, a few villagers and their scout. Map selection is random and cannot be chosen by either players. Champion mode PvP results will also determine your [[TrueSkill]] ranking which is used to determine a player's rank globally as well as to help find the player a match and opponents for PvP. Currently, in Sparta PvP, there is an option for 1v1 PvP and 2v2 PvP. Rewards from Sparta PvP include experience points, empire points, gold and Sparta points which can be used in the stores in Sparta for chests, gear and consumables.\n\nPvP is also accessible through the Arena in the player's capital city. While identical to Sparta PvP in many ways, Arena PvP can differ in many ways. In Arena PvP, you can play against any human opponent in your party as well as choose the map and teams (if it is a 2v2 match) before starting the game. Arena PvP  will not affect your Sparta PvP Trueskill ranking. Finally, arena PvP also does not provide any rewards to the winning player. The August 2012 update also added a new spectator mode option for Arena PvP<ref name=\"AnniversaryUpdate\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ageofempiresonline.com/en/articles/blog-20120814-2|title=Blog post: Anniversary Update - Design Notes|publisher=Age of Empires Online website|date=August 14, 2012|accessdate=September 6, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817225606/http://www.ageofempiresonline.com/en/articles/blog-20120814-2|archive-date=August 17, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and the October 2012 update made Arena PvP (Standard or Champion mode) free for all players.<ref name=\"ageofempiresonline2\">{{cite web |author=GPG Design Team |url=http://ageofempiresonline.com/en/articles/blog-20121022 |title=Blog |publisher=Age of Empires Online |date=October 22, 2012 |accessdate=January 19, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024231553/http://ageofempiresonline.com/en/articles/blog-20121022 |archive-date=October 24, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Civilizations===\nSix [[civilization]]s are available.

Robot was hired by Microsoft to develop the game over a 24-month period. The entire studio team focused on it as their sole project, in an effort to earn startup funds for Robot's future projects.<ref name=\"Robot\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2012/04/18/interview-patrick-hudson-robot-entertainment.aspx|title=Director's Cut: Interview With Robot Entertainment's Patrick Hudson|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=April 18, 2012|accessdate=April 30, 2012|first=Matt|last=Helgeson|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422063546/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2012/04/18/interview-patrick-hudson-robot-entertainment.aspx|archive-date=April 22, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nDuring early production, ''Age of Empires Online'' was originally called ''Age of Empires IV''. The development team had noticed that many other RTS game developers had moved away from the \"economic game\". The team felt that ''[[Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings]]'' had blended the economic and military aspects of the game perfectly, so they decided to play test it with hindsight. They noticed that many features had been lost or changed over time. It was during this time the team decided to do an \"''Age of Kings'' style gameplay in an ''[[Age of Empires (video game)|Age of Empires]]'' setting\". The designers were surprised that fans of the series were most fond of the simpler aspects of the previous titles. Former ''Age of Empires II'' lead designer Ian M. Fischer stated, \"When we started floating some of the early [AoEO] out to people other pieces fell into place \u2013 I cannot tell you how many times I have had someone email me or talk to me at a show and mention how much they loved the villagers carrying big hunks of meat in the original Age or the priest \"wololo\"\". From that point on, one of the goals was to invoke nostalgia from fans of the series when playing the game, despite the newer and updated features.<ref name=\"Earlydesign\">{{cite web|url=http://www.robotentertainment.com/blog/detail/Hi-Honey-Were-Home|title=Hi Honey, We're Home|publisher=[[Robot Entertainment]]|date=August 27, 2010|accessdate=April 27, 2012|last=Fischer|first=Ian M.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301120444/http://www.robotentertainment.com/blog/detail/Hi-Honey-Were-Home|archive-date=March 1, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe decision to make the game online-only was based in part on the success of ''Age of Empires II'' and the popularity of its online integration with [[MSN Gaming Zone]]. Since online player interaction through the game was made a priority by the studio, two iterations of the game had to be created; a server version and a client version. This resulted in a heavily modified version of the BANG engine used in previous games of the series, along with requiring large amounts of additional server code and infrastructure to be implemented. Excluding the tools, ''Age of Empires Online'' contains over 1.2 million lines of code.<ref name=\"Gamedesign\">{{cite web|url=http://www.robotentertainment.com/blog/detail/Brief-History-Time-And-Age-Engine|title=A Brief History of Time (And the Age Engine)|publisher=[[Robot Entertainment]]|date=September 10, 2010|accessdate=April 27, 2012|last=Fermier|first=Rob|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914080956/http://www.robotentertainment.com/blog/detail/Brief-History-Time-and-Age-Engine|archive-date=September 14, 2010|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn designing the new look for the game, Robot had six artists come together to create a new art style which would look similar to the previous games from the series, yet look more \"visually appealing\", \"timeless\", and \"bright\". Among the art team was Ensemble Studios' first artist Brad Crow, who had worked on every ''Age of Empires'' game produced by the studio. The team implemented several ideas to give the game an improved core visual interface over that of its predecessors such as; increasing the field of view so that the player was able to see more on the screen, a tighter user interface to allow more of the field of play to be visible, a new building design to make them encompass less screen space &mdash; while also making them look more recognizable, and giving each unit a unique look and animation making them more easily distinguishable from each other.<ref name=\"Artdesign\" />\n\nThe music and sound for the game was developed by GL33k and veteran video game composer [[Chris Rickwood]]. In composing the music, Rickwood strove to keep it in the spirit of [[Stephen Rippy|Stephen Rippy's]] and Kevin McMullan's work from the prior games of the series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gl33k.com/consolepc/2011/8/15/age-of-empires-online.html |title=GL33k Game Audio - Console/PC - Age Of Empires Online |publisher=Gl33k.com |date=August 15, 2011 |accessdate=January 19, 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130216041439/http://gl33k.com/consolepc/2011/8/15/age-of-empires-online.html |archive-date=February 16, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn February 24, 2011, it was announced - first via [[Chris Taylor (game designer)|Chris Taylor]]'s Facebook page - that [[Gas Powered Games]] had taken over development from Robot Entertainment.

The Tigers were victorious 8\u20132.  The winning pitcher was Detroit [[starting pitcher|starter]] [[Brian Moehler]].  The losing pitcher was [[Jeff Suppan]].\n\n===The pregame ceremony===\n\nPrior to the final game at [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]], a ceremony was held. It was emceed by then current Tiger broadcaster and [[Ford C. Frick Award]] recipient [[Ernie Harwell]]. At the ceremony, owner [[Mike Ilitch]] spoke along with then [[Michigan]] [[Governor of Michigan|governor]] [[John Engler]], then [[List of mayors of Detroit, Michigan|Detroit mayor]] [[Dennis Archer]] and [[Baseball commissioner|Commissioner of Baseball]] [[Bud Selig]]. Also featured at the ceremony was longtime Tiger [[right fielder]] and [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Al Kaline]].\n\nInstead of both managers exchanging lineups before the game, both clubs appointed honorary captains. Representing the Tigers was Kaline and representing the Royals was former MVP and Hall of Fame [[third baseman]] [[George Brett]].\n{{cquote|''Well, here's [[Robert Fick]].  Another man who's counted on in the future, wearing [[Norm Cash]]'s number 25..remember, [[Al Kaline|Al]] told him he'd hit a home run today.  AND HE DID!  There she goes!  And it is...on the roof!  Robert Fick, a grand slam that hits the roof and comes back!  Kaline called it!  How do you like that?  Look at these flashbulbs!  What a moment!'' \u2013 [[Frank Beckmann]] on [[WKBD]] television, calling Fick's eighth inning grand slam off [[Jeff Montgomery (baseball)|Jeff Montgomery]], the final home run hit at Tiger Stadium.}}\n\n{{cquote|''Tigers lead it 8\u20132.  Two down in the ninth inning.  [[Todd Jones|Jones]] is ready.  He delivers.  Here's a swing and a miss.  The game is over, and Tiger Stadium is no more.'' \u2013 [[Ernie Harwell]], calling [[Carlos Beltr\u00e1n]]'s strikeout to end the game on [[WJR]] radio.}}\n\n===The postgame ceremony===\n\nThe game ended at 7:07 pm.  The grounds crew then surrounded home plate.  Groundskeeper Charlie McGee, using a pick axe, dug up home plate at 7:13.  It would then be transported by Tiger pitchers [[Matt Anderson (baseball)|Matt Anderson]], [[Jeff Weaver]], and [[Francisco Cordero]], with police escort, to [[Comerica Park]].\n\nErnie Harwell then read a history of [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]] accompanied by music from the movie ''[[Field of Dreams]]''.  He introduced a film containing images of such Tiger legends as [[Ty Cobb]], [[Sam Crawford]], [[Hughie Jennings]] and [[Harry Heilmann]].  In addition, the Tigers Hall of Famers were honored: [[Heinie Manush]], [[Mickey Cochrane]], [[Charlie Gehringer]], [[Hank Greenberg]], [[Hal Newhouser]], [[George Kell]], and Harwell.\n\nFollowing remarks from [[Willie Horton (baseball)|Willie Horton]] and former manager [[Sparky Anderson]], there emerged from the center field gate players from times past, including [[Mark Fidrych]], [[Bill Freehan]], [[Dick McAuliffe]], [[Dave Bergman]], [[Mickey Stanley]], Willie Horton, [[Kirk Gibson]], [[Cecil Fielder]], [[Al Kaline]], the combination of [[Alan Trammell]] and [[Lou Whitaker]], and [[Elden Auker]].   A line was formed from the center field flagpole to home plate, along which was passed the flag that had flown from the pole in dead center over the finale.\n\nAfter Auker passed the flag to catcher Brad Ausmus, players threw souvenirs into the stands as some reached over and put dirt from the warning track into plastic bags.  It was at this time that Harwell gave his final goodbye: \"Tonight, we say good-bye. ... Farewell, old friend Tiger Stadium.  We will remember.\"\n\nAt 8:19, the scoreboard was shut off.  At quarter to nine, a final team picture was taken, and by 9 the stands were empty.  As the last of the fans left, a sign was hung on the famous right-center field overhang which read: \"Today, there is crying in baseball.  So long, old friend.\"\n\n===Ernie Harwell's farewell===\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, less than six months ago, we began a warm season of farewells, and with each passing day we came a little bit closer to this historic occasion.\n\n\"The [[Detroit Lions|Lions]], [[Joe Louis]] and [[Nelson Mandela]].  6,873 regular-season games, 35 [[World Series|postseason]] contests and a trio of spectacular [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Games]], Tiger Stadium has been home to this great game of baseball.  But more than anything, it has been a cherished home to our memories.\n\n\"Will you remember that last base hit? The last out?  How about that last pitch?  Or maybe it's the first time as a child when you saw that green, green grass that will forever be etched into your mind and soul.\n\n\"Tonight, we say good-bye.  But we will not forget.  Open your eyes, look around and take a mental picture.  Moments like this shall live on forever.\n\n\"It's been 88 moving years at Michigan and Trumbull.   The tradition built here shall endure along with the permanence of the Olde English D.  But tonight we must say good-bye.\n\n\"Farewell, old friend Tiger Stadium.

The Tigers were victorious 8\u20132.  The winning pitcher was Detroit [[starting pitcher|starter]] [[Brian Moehler]].  The losing pitcher was [[Jeff Suppan]].\n\n===The pregame ceremony===\n\nPrior to the final game at [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]], a ceremony was held. It was emceed by then current Tiger broadcaster and [[Ford C. Frick Award]] recipient [[Ernie Harwell]]. At the ceremony, owner [[Mike Ilitch]] spoke along with then [[Michigan]] [[Governor of Michigan|governor]] [[John Engler]], then [[List of mayors of Detroit, Michigan|Detroit mayor]] [[Dennis Archer]] and [[Baseball commissioner|Commissioner of Baseball]] [[Bud Selig]]. Also featured at the ceremony was longtime Tiger [[right fielder]] and [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Al Kaline]].\n\nInstead of both managers exchanging lineups before the game, both clubs appointed honorary captains. Representing the Tigers was Kaline and representing the Royals was former MVP and Hall of Fame [[third baseman]] [[George Brett]].\n{{cquote|''Well, here's [[Robert Fick]].  Another man who's counted on in the future, wearing [[Norm Cash]]'s number 25..remember, [[Al Kaline|Al]] told him he'd hit a home run today.  AND HE DID!  There she goes!  And it is...on the roof!  Robert Fick, a grand slam that hits the roof and comes back!  Kaline called it!  How do you like that?  Look at these flashbulbs!  What a moment!'' \u2013 [[Frank Beckmann]] on [[WKBD]] television, calling Fick's eighth inning grand slam off [[Jeff Montgomery (baseball)|Jeff Montgomery]], the final home run hit at Tiger Stadium.}}\n\n{{cquote|''Tigers lead it 8\u20132.  Two down in the ninth inning.  [[Todd Jones|Jones]] is ready.  He delivers.  Here's a swing and a miss.  The game is over, and Tiger Stadium is no more.'' \u2013 [[Ernie Harwell]], calling [[Carlos Beltr\u00e1n]]'s strikeout to end the game on [[WJR]] radio.}}\n\n===The postgame ceremony===\n\nThe game ended at 7:07 pm.  The grounds crew then surrounded home plate.  Groundskeeper Charlie McGee, using a pick axe, dug up home plate at 7:13.  It would then be transported by Tiger pitchers [[Matt Anderson (baseball)|Matt Anderson]], [[Jeff Weaver]], and [[Francisco Cordero]], with police escort, to [[Comerica Park]].\n\nErnie Harwell then read a history of [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]] accompanied by music from the movie ''[[Field of Dreams]]''.  He introduced a film containing images of such Tiger legends as [[Ty Cobb]], [[Sam Crawford]], [[Hughie Jennings]] and [[Harry Heilmann]].  In addition, the Tigers Hall of Famers were honored: [[Heinie Manush]], [[Mickey Cochrane]], [[Charlie Gehringer]], [[Hank Greenberg]], [[Hal Newhouser]], [[George Kell]], and Harwell.\n\nFollowing remarks from [[Willie Horton (baseball)|Willie Horton]] and former manager [[Sparky Anderson]], there emerged from the center field gate players from times past, including [[Mark Fidrych]], [[Bill Freehan]], [[Dick McAuliffe]], [[Dave Bergman]], [[Mickey Stanley]], Willie Horton, [[Kirk Gibson]], [[Cecil Fielder]], [[Al Kaline]], the combination of [[Alan Trammell]] and [[Lou Whitaker]], and [[Elden Auker]].   A line was formed from the center field flagpole to home plate, along which was passed the flag that had flown from the pole in dead center over the finale.\n\nAfter Auker passed the flag to catcher Brad Ausmus, players threw souvenirs into the stands as some reached over and put dirt from the warning track into plastic bags.  It was at this time that Harwell gave his final goodbye: \"Tonight, we say good-bye. ... Farewell, old friend Tiger Stadium.  We will remember.\"\n\nAt 8:19, the scoreboard was shut off.  At quarter to nine, a final team picture was taken, and by 9 the stands were empty.  As the last of the fans left, a sign was hung on the famous right-center field overhang which read: \"Today, there is crying in baseball.  So long, old friend.\"\n\n===Ernie Harwell's farewell===\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, less than six months ago, we began a warm season of farewells, and with each passing day we came a little bit closer to this historic occasion.\n\n\"The [[Detroit Lions|Lions]], [[Joe Louis]] and [[Nelson Mandela]].  6,873 regular-season games, 35 [[World Series|postseason]] contests and a trio of spectacular [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Games]], Tiger Stadium has been home to this great game of baseball.  But more than anything, it has been a cherished home to our memories.\n\n\"Will you remember that last base hit? The last out?  How about that last pitch?

Bellamy distanced himself from radical socialist values and in many ways his ideal society still imitated many of the systems in late 19th century United States. However, his book served as the inspiration for a mass political movement called nationalism within the United States in the late 1800s. Those [[Nationalist Clubs]], so called because of their desire to nationalize [[industry]], were strong supporters of the [[People's Party (United States)|populists]], who wanted the [[nationalization]] of the railroad and telegraph systems. Despite their propaganda and involvement in politics, the nationalist movement began to decline in 1893 due to the financial difficulties of its main publications and Bellamy's failing health and essentially disappeared by the turn of the century.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn the society depicted in the novel, private property has been abolished in favor of state ownership, social classes were eliminated and all work which was minimal and relatively easy was done voluntarily by all citizens between the ages of 21 and 45. Workers were rewarded and recognized via a ranking system based on the army.<ref name=\"Bellamy\">{{cite book|last=Bellamy|first=Edward|title=Looking Backward: 2000-1887|url=https://archive.org/details/lookingbackward01bellgoog|date=1888|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}</ref> Most importantly, the government is the most powerful and respected institution, necessary for providing and maintaining this [[utopia]].<ref name=\"History\"/> Arthur Lipow identifies the bureaucratic ruling of this ideal society as a quasi-military organization of both economic and social relations.<ref name=\"Lipow\">{{cite book|last=Lipow|first=Arthur|title=Authoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement|date=1991|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520075436}}</ref> Bellamy elevated the modern military as a catalyst for national interest.<ref name=\"Bellamy\"/>\n\nThe biggest critique of Bellamy's society is that it is based on the idea of socialism from above. The regime is imposed on the people by an expert elite and there is no democratic control or individual liberty. Lipow argues that this inherently leads to [[authoritarianism]], writing: \"If the workers and the vast majority were a brutish mass, there could be no question of forming a political movement out of them nor of giving them the task of creating a socialist society. The new institutions would not be created and shaped from below but would, of necessity, correspond to the plan laid down in advance by the utopian planner\".<ref name=\"Lipow\"/>\n\n=== Austrian and Chicago schools of economics ===\n[[Friedrich Hayek]], an Austrian-born economist, was one of the leading academic critics of [[collectivism]] in the 20th century.

Other features that are common to modern authoritarian [[socialist states]] (starting in the 20th century) include an emphasis on [[heavy industry]] for [[Economic development|development]], a [[Single-party state|single-party system]] to propel the goals of the [[State (polity)|state]] forward, the extensive use of [[propaganda]] to do the same and more.<ref name=\"Huntington\"/><ref name=\"Lowy\"/><ref name=\"Amandae\"/>\n\nSoviet advocates and socialists responded to these criticisms by highlighting the ideological differences in the concept of [[Liberty#Politics|freedom]]. For instance, it was noted that \"[[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] norms disparaged ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[Liberal individualism|individualism]] (as when housing is determined by one's ability to pay)\" and condemned \"wide variations in personal wealth as the West has not\" whilst emphasizing equality, by which they meant \"free education and medical care, little disparity in housing or salaries, and so forth\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McFarland|first1=Sam|last2=Ageyev|first2=Vladimir|last3=Abalakina-Paap|first3=Marina|title=Authoritarianism in the former Soviet Union|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=63|issue=6|pages=1004\u20131010|date=1992|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.63.6.1004|citeseerx=10.1.1.397.4546}}</ref>\n\nWhen asked to comment on the claim that former citizens of socialist states now enjoy increased freedoms, [[Heinz Kessler]], former [[Ministry of National Defence (East Germany)|East German Minister of National Defence]], replied: \"Millions of people in Eastern Europe are now free from employment, free from safe streets, free from health care, free from social security\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Parenti|first=Michael|title=Blackshirts and Reds: Rational Fascism and the Overthrow of Communism|year=1997|publisher=City Lights Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0-87286-330-9|page=118}}</ref>\n\n=== Formation of industry ===\nAs authoritarian powers enforce socialist economics, the process often goes hand in hand with supporting the growth of heavy industry as a means of reaching [[industrialization]] (as can be seen with [[Joseph Stalin]]'s control of the [[Soviet Union]]).

The party's decisions are so integrated into public life that its economic and non-economic decisions are part of their overall actions.\n* State ownership of the means of production in which natural resources and capital belong to society.\n* Central economic planning, the main characteristic of an authoritarian, state socialist economy.

The five-year plans integrated the political, military and economic strategy that would be pursued in the next five years as well as changes in capacity and production rates.

The party makes all the decisions, but they should take into account the desires of the population and these desires were then to be weighted into the decision making. According to Article 11 of its [[1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1977 constitution]], the main goal of the [[Soviet Union]] was to \"raise the material and cultural standards of the working people\". Marxist thought and its interpretation by the Soviet Union dictated that private ownership was to be banned and the nationalization of all aspects of production a necessity, yet some things were not nationalized for the sake of economic efficiency or production targets. There was an emphasis on rapid industrialization, the development of heavy industry, relegation of consumer production as non-essential and collectivization of agriculture. [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economies]] also used a larger proportion of their resources on investment than do market economies. The issue with this was that current consumption was undercut because of the over-investment. All these actions supported the purposes of the state, not the people.<ref name=\"Ader\">Ader, Emile Bertrand (1970). ''Communism, Classic and Contemporary''. Woodbury: Barron's Educational Series. {{ISBN|9780812004038}}.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1940s\u20131970s, the [[economy of the Soviet Union]] grew at a rate that outpaced that of Western European nations, but by the 1980s the Soviet economy was in shambles. This has been attributed to the [[Era of Stagnation]], a more tolerant central government and increasing military spending caused by the [[nuclear arms race]] with the United States, especially under [[Ronald Reagan]], whose administration pursued more aggressive relations with the Soviet Union instead of [[d\u00e9tente]] that was preferred in the 1970s. The end to the [[post-war consensus]] and [[Keynesianism]] in the 1970s and the rise of [[neoliberalism]] and [[economic globalization]] in the 1980s also caused problems as they forced the Soviet Union and other countries to adapt and reform themselves. Unlike China, the Soviet's failure to do so further contributed to its dissolution in December 1991. Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union to guarantee employment to all of its labor force, it did not satisfy the human desires of its laborers because \"people want land, not collectivization. Consumers want goods, not gigantic industrial enterprise. Workers want better wages and higher living standards, not citations and medals.

In 1913, prior to both [[World War I]] and the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, the former Soviet Union had a GDP per capita of $1,488 in 1990 international dollars which grew 461% to $6,871 by 1990. After its dissolution in December 1991, this figure fell to $3,893 by 1998.

There were countries that chose to introduce the new economic system gradually ([[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[East Germany]] and [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]]) and countries that decided to first prepare theoretically, then experimentation at different levels and then in a large scale ([[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]]). [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] was set apart because the first stage of its transition consisted of economic recovery and then socialism was gradually implemented. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] differed from other Eastern European countries in that after 1950 it modified its economic system by making self-management the base of enterprise activity.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/> There were also a few differences between the economic model of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries such as East Germany and Poland. Czechoslovakia and East Germany were administered along regional lines. Poland retained a centralized system similar to the Stalinist centralization of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Wellisz\"/> The Eastern European countries differed from the Soviet Union in that they had greater flexibility in the management of subordinate firms, the market was assigned a greater importance, accessible foreign trade and liberalization of the exchange of capital goods. There was also less bureaucracy than in the Soviet Union involved in the planning of the countries.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/>\n\nThe Eastern Bloc countries achieved high rates of economic and technical progress, promoted industrialization and ensured steady growth rates of labor productivity and rises in the standard of living<ref>Shiryayev, Y.; Sokolov, A.

Countries such as China that did not isolate and instead reformed themselves thrived, but this did not happen in most Eastern Bloc countries as they depended upon the Soviet Union, especially for significant amounts of materials.<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/> From the end of the World War II to the mid-1970s, the economy of the Eastern Bloc steadily increased at the same rate as the economy in Western Europe, with the least none-reforming [[Stalinist]] nations of the Eastern Bloc having a stronger economy then the reformist-Stalinist states.<ref>Teichova, Alice; Matis, Herbert (2003).

Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-79278-3}}.</ref> While most Western European economies essentially began to approach the GDP per capita levels of the United States during the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Eastern Bloc countries did not,<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/> with per capita GDPs trailing significantly behind their comparable Western European counterparts.<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/>\n\nFollowing the fall of the [[Eastern Bloc]] with the [[Revolutions of 1989]], the economies of [[post-Soviet states]] quickly fell apart and took a long time to return to pre-1989 levels.<ref name=\"Maddison\"/> Not only growth plummeted following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991, but also living standards declined, drug use, homelessness and poverty skyrocketed and suicides increased dramatically. Growth did not begin to return to pre-reform-era levels for approximately fifteen years. Some scholars have claimed that the Soviet model's industrialization and modernization laid the groundwork for their later [[economic growth]], without which their current market-oriented economy may have not thrived or growth as much, or that it provided a better quality of life than market economies.<ref name=\"Cereseto\"/> The [[1991 Soviet Union referendum]] (77% on an 80% turnout voted to preserve the Soviet Union and all [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]] voters voted in favor, with the [[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkmenia Republic]] showing the most support at 98% and the lowest in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian Republic]] at 73%)<ref>[https://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&id=su011991 \"Sowjetunion, 17.

Aldershot; Burlington: Ashgate. {{ISBN|9780754636571}}.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], [[Mao Zedong]] condemned [[Stalinism]] and the flaws in the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] movement that peaked with the [[Hungarian Uprising of 1956]]. This gave Mao space in which to experiment with departure from the Soviet socialist economy. The Maoist economic model was reliant on ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' and ''Ten Great Relationships''. Mao modeled the Chinese socialist economy in such a way that it led to the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[People's commune|Commune Movement]]. In ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', Mao focused on the industrialization and mechanization of the countryside; in ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' wrote about his thoughts on the problems of socialist states as well as the conflicts of interest in the Chinese socialist society; and in ''Ten Great Relationships'' wrote about his vision of China's economy.<ref>Nove, Alec; Nuti, D. M. (1972). ''Socialist Economics''. Harmondsworth: Penguin. pp. 491\u2013510. {{ISBN|9780140806229}}.</ref>\n\nThe Maoist model had a dual economic goal, namely the industrialization of the countryside and the socialization of its people. It differed from the Soviet Union's goals in that Mao emphasized the [[class struggle]] against the [[bourgeoisie]] while the Soviet Union started advocating [[peaceful coexistence]]. China also allowed for more flexibility and experimentation than the Soviet Union and the countryside was at the center of its policies.<ref>Hoffmann, Charles (September 1971). \"The Maoist Economic Model\".

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n=== Economic challenges and legacy ===\nThe problem with the central planning of authoritarian socialist states is that as the state develops, it also grows in complexity and the possible errors grow and the possibilities of dis-allocations and waste of resources.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/> As commented by [[Karl Marx]], capitalism works because it is a system of economic force, but in socialist economics this force is insufficient to provide enough incentive. Human needs should be taken into account to make a socialist society function, but there is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital and human satisfaction.<ref>Ollman, Berell; Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel (1998).

New York: Routledge. pp. 60\u201362. {{ISBN|9780415919678}}.</ref> Some of the issues that emerged during the socialist phase of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and Maoist China included:\n* Inflation: Yugoslavia raised its industrial prices by 17% and its agricultural prices by 32% from 1964 to 1965 while Czechoslovakia raised the prices of foodstuffs and services by 20% in 1966 and by 1967 prices were up by 30%.\n* Lagged consumption: there was a lag between when products were fabricated and when they were accessed to by the population, goods tended to stockpile. The production of consumer products also diminished and in Yugoslavia the share of consumer products fell from 70% before World War II to 31% in 1965.\n* Fixing prices: prices were fixed under the premise that it would force producers to behave more efficiently and as such the price-controlled products were produced in lower quantities. In Yugoslavia, the market distortion caused by the price fixing was realized and led to the un-freezing of prices in 1967. Hungary also had frozen prices and slowly unfroze them over a period of ten to fifteen years because otherwise the structural disproportions of the Hungarian economy would spin prices out of control.\n* Production structure: many factories were kept running through government subsidies and protection despite any economic losses of the factories. This decreased overall efficiency of the socialist economies and also increased the financial losses of those economies.\n* Disproportionality: there was a disproportionate amount of available jobs and manpower. As argued by Ljubo Sirc, the \"Soviet Union and other communist countries have the worst of both worlds: some enterprises or operations are inefficient because they are too capital-intensive, other enterprises or operations because they are too labour-intensive\".<ref name=\"Sirc\"/>\n\nThe [[Stalinist]] economic model in which the socialist economies were based did not allow for a decrease in growth rates. It did not allow for the flexibility needed to keep up with growing economies.<ref name=\"Marangos\"/> Despite these shortcomings, the Soviet Union's growth in GDP per capita compared favorably with Western Europe.<ref name=\"Maddison\"/> It has also been noted that such states compared favorably with Western states in some health indicators such as [[infant mortality]] and [[life expectancy]],<ref>Ellman, Michael (2014).

This development culminated in the empowerment of a [[proletariat]] which could benefit from the fruits of [[industrialization]] without being exploited. Although he meant his ideology to appeal to the disenfranchised working class of an industrialized society, it was widely accepted by developing countries that had yet to successfully industrialize.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> This resulted in stagnant economies and socialist states without the necessary organization and structure to industrialize.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> Seeing the failure of those models, Lenin concluded that socialism in Russia had to be constructed from above through party dictatorship that appealed to both the working class and peasants.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> Because the working class accounted for only 15% of the population, Lenin was forced to appeal to the much greater peasant class (accounting for nearly 80%) to propel the [[Bolshevik]] faction of [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] that under Lenin eventually became the [[Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]] due to a split with [[social democracy]].<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> The Bolsheviks promised \"Bread, Peace, and Land\" to the peasants and delivered, redistributing land from the landlords and increasing the number of farms in Russia from 427,000 in 1917 to 463,000 in 1919.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nFor some, Lenin's legacy was one of violent terror and concentration of power in the hands of few.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> Lenin intentionally employed violence as a means to manipulate the population and tolerated absolutely no opposition, arguing that it was \"a great deal better to 'discuss with rifles' than with the theses of the opposition\".<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> He worked for the ideological destruction of society as a whole so that it could easily adopt the rhetoric and political ideals of the ruling party.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> Lenin's use of terror (instilled by a secret police apparatus) to exact social obedience, mass murder and disappearance, censoring of communications and absence of justice was only reinforced by his successor [[Joseph Stalin]].<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> In contrast to those who support this thesis,<ref>Leggett, George (1986) [1981].

Presumably, the exploited classes believed that once the rapid and successful industrialization of Russia had taken place, power would be relinquished by the [[vanguard party]] and [[Communist society|communism]] would ensue.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> However, Stalin continued to demand even more far-reaching sacrifices. Because of his control over both political and economic arenas which historians argue gave his vanguard party an amount of control surpassing that of [[Russian tsar|Russia's tzars or emperors]], citizens were unwilling to challenge his decrees, given that aspects of their lives such as medical care, housing and social freedoms could be restricted according to the discretion of the party.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nDespite failures, Stalin's expectations remained uncontested by the working class and the model was adopted by a multitude of emerging socialist states during that era.

As the majority of excess deaths under Stalin were not direct killings, the exact number of victims of Stalinism is difficult to calculate due to lack of consensus among scholars on which deaths can be attributed to Stalin.<ref>Getty, J.

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n==== Maoism ====\n[[Maoism]] is an adapted Sino-centric version of [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]].<ref name=\"Esh\">{{cite journal|last=Esherick|first=Joseph W.|title=On the \"Restoration of Capitalism\": Mao and Marxist Theory|journal=Modern China|date=January 1979|volume=5|issue=1|pages=41\u201377|doi=10.1177/009770047900500102}}</ref> While believing in [[democratic centralism]], where party decisions are brought about by scrutiny and debate and then are binding upon all members of the party once implemented, Mao did not accept dissenters to the party's decisions.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/> Through the [[Cultural Revolution]] and the [[Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries]], Mao attempted to purge any subversive idea\u2014especially capitalist or Western threat\u2014with heavy force, justifying his actions as the necessary way for the central authority to keep power.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/>\n\nAt the same time, Mao emphasized the importance of cultural heritage and individual choice as a way of creating this national unity. He described his ideal system as \"a political situation in which there is both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unity of purpose and personal ease of mind and liveliness to facilitate the socialist revolution\".<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/> While the system advocates contradiction, Mao believed the state above all could provide the masses with the tools for their own expression, but his own brand of self-expression was wholly manufactured, built largely on replacing [[Chinese culture|traditional practices and artifacts]] with his own. Through this, transformation of the people towards an internal party collectiveness was possible.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/>\n\nNotably, Mao's authoritarianism was rooted in a collective bottom-up style of empowerment. In his system, the proletariat and peasantry were responsible for rising up against the bureaucracy and capital of the state.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Joining the peasant class with the [[bourgeoisie]] of the countryside (the land-holding, local farmers), the group was able to stifle the claims to power by the wealthier, urban landowners through the banner of [[communism]]. Only when this collection of [[peasant]]s and [[petty bourgeoisie]] existed could Mao grow his own, custom bureaucracy.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Once this unity was established, Mao argued that the people were the ones who could control the state, but his government's intense control over the citizenry emphasizes the contradiction in his theory\u2014a contradiction, he maintained, was a necessary reality of their specialized system <ref name=\"Esh\"/>\n\n=== Arab world ===\n{{see also|Arab socialism}}\nSocialism was introduced into the Middle East in the form of [[Populism|populist]] policies designed to galvanize the [[working class]] into overthrowing [[colonial powers]] and their domestic allies. These policies were held by authoritarian states interested in the rapid industrialisation and social equalisation of Arab nations and often were characterised by redistributive or protectionist economic policies, lower class mobilization, charismatic leaders and promises to improve national living standards.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\">{{cite book|last=King|first=Stephen J.|year=2009|title=The New Authoritarianism in The Middle East and North Africa|location=Bloomington|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253221469}}</ref> Those states were progressive in terms of the colonial development that had occurred thus far. They allowed important political and economic gains to be made by workers, encouraged land redistribution, unseated oligarchical political powers and implemented [[Import substitution industrialization|import-substituting]] industrialisation development strategies.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/>\n\nWith the collapse of the [[Eastern Bloc]] following the [[Revolutions of 1989]] and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991 as well as the push for [[democratization]], many Arab states have moved toward a model of fiscal discipline proposed by the [[Washington Consensus]].<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/> Although authoritarian leaders of those states implemented democratic institutions during the 1980s and 1990s, their multi-party elections created an arena in which business elites could lobby for personal interests while largely silencing the lower class.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/> [[Economic liberalisation]] in these regions yielded economies that led to regimes built on the support of rent-seeking urban elites, with political opposition inviting the prospect of political marginalisation and even retaliation.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/>\n\n==== Resistance to democratisation ====\n[[File:WOSM-WAGGGS-Arab Region.svg|thumb|[[Arab world]]]]\nA great deal of debate has been paid by the field of comparative politics to how the Arab region was able to avoid the [[Third Wave Democracy|third wave of democratization]]. A number of arguments have been offered by professionals in the field, ranging from a discussion of [[Democratization|prerequisites]] not supported by the [[Arab culture]] to a lack of democratic actors initiating the necessary democratic transition.\n\nMarsha Pripstein Posusney argues that the \"patriarchal and tribal mentality of the culture is an impediment to the development of pluralist values\", rendering Arab citizens prone to accept patriarchal leaders and lacking the national unity that many argue is necessary for democratization to be successful.<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\">{{cite book|last=Posusney|first=Marsha Pripstein|title=Authoritarianism in the Middle East: Regimes and Resistance|date=2005|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|location=Boulder|isbn=978-1-58826-317-9}}</ref> Eva Bellin concedes that the prevalence of [[Islam]] is a distinguishing factor of the region and therefore must contribute to the region's exceptionalism, \"given Islam's presumed inhospitality to democracy\".<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\"/> Posusney argues that this \"intrinsic incompatibility between democracy and Islam\" remains unproven given that efforts to test this association quantitatively have failed to produce conclusive results.<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\"/> Ethnic divisions in the area have also been cited as a factor as well as a weak civil society, a state-controlled economy, poverty, low literacy rates and inequality.<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\"/><ref name=\"Debating\">{{cite book|last=Schlumberger|first=Oliver|title=Debating Arab Authoritarianism: Dynamics and Durability in Nondemocratic Regimes|year=2007|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford|isbn=978-0-8047-5776-8}}</ref>\n\nIn his book ''Debating Arab Authoritarianism: Dynamics and Durability in Nondemocratic Regimes'', Oliver Schlumberger has argued that there is in fact an international ambivalence toward authoritarianism in the Middle East given that stability is preferred over the uncertainty of democratization due to the region's oil and gas supplies and the strategic importance of its geopolitical location.<ref name=\"Debating\"/>\n\n=== Africa ===\n{{see also|African socialism}}\n[[File:L\u00e9opold Senghor, Pic, 5.jpg|thumb|150px|[[L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor]]]]\nDuring the [[Pan-African Congress|1945 Pan-African Conference]], calls for increased organization, development and self-determination in the poverty stricken African continent put the impetus on colonial powers to negotiate [[national sovereignty]].<ref name=\"Mushkat\">{{cite journal|last=Mushkat|first=Marion|title=African Socialism Reappraised and Reconsidered|journal=Istituto Italiano per l'Africa e l'Oriente|date=June 1972|volume=2|pages=151\u2013153}}</ref> While there were few Marxist movements into the continent, Soviet Union activity spurred anti-imperialist and globalization movements from African countries.

However, they did not establish clear social or political parameters for this new liberation.<ref name=\"Mushkat\"/>\n\nAfrican leaders consistently viewed socialism as a direct rejection of the [[Colonisation of Africa|colonial system]] and in turn dismissed the notion of creating independent capitalist systems throughout the continent. They attempted to infuse various forms of socialism\u2014some Marxist\u2013Leninist, others democratic\u2014into tailored ideologies specific to each country.<ref name=\"Mushkat\"/> Once these systems were in place, countries developed towards a \"focal institutional\" society.

His revision proved similar to that of [[Benito Mussolini]] as he called on a national movement from and for his one-party-ruled government, arguing: \"In a word, we must awaken the National Consciousness. [...] But the government cannot and must not do it all. It must be helped by the party. [...] Our party must be the consciousness of the masses\".<ref name=\"Gregor\"/>\n\n==== Ghana ====\nIn the same vein as Senghor, socialist leader [[Kwame Nkrumah]] sought to advance this one-party, nationalized form of socialist obedience.

Those elites were only afforded one choice, namely to align with their government if they wanted access to the state.

In the system, all Tanzanains were encouraged to run for office, with no campaign funding allowed. Speeches in the election would not focus on the national issues, but rather on the quality of the individual, each of whom would be closely controlled by TANU.<ref name=\"Pratt\"/> Structurally, the power was shared along regional boundaries, giving increased policy making power and resource allocation to these regions.

Draper makes the argument that this division echoes the division between \"reformist or revolutionary, peaceful or violent, democratic or authoritarian, etc.\"<ref name=\"Two Souls\"/> and identifies [[elitism]] as being one of the six major varieties of socialism from above, arguing: {{quote|We have mentioned several cases of this conviction that socialism is the business of a new ruling minority, non-capitalist in nature and therefore guaranteed pure, imposing its own domination either temporarily (for a mere historical era) or even permanently.

Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-280431-6}}.</ref> This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific progress and material progress.<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/>\n\nThe first major fictional work that proposed an authoritarian socialist state was [[Edward Bellamy]]'s novel ''[[Looking Backward]]'' which depicted a [[bureaucratic]] [[Utopian socialism|socialist utopia]]. Bellamy distanced himself from radical socialist values and in many ways his ideal society still imitated many of the systems in late 19th century United States. However, his book served as the inspiration for a mass political movement called nationalism within the United States in the late 1800s. Those [[Nationalist Clubs]], so called because of their desire to nationalize [[industry]], were strong supporters of the [[People's Party (United States)|populists]], who wanted the [[nationalization]] of the railroad and telegraph systems. Despite their propaganda and involvement in politics, the nationalist movement began to decline in 1893 due to the financial difficulties of its main publications and Bellamy's failing health and essentially disappeared by the turn of the century.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn the society depicted in the novel, private property has been abolished in favor of state ownership, social classes were eliminated and all work which was minimal and relatively easy was done voluntarily by all citizens between the ages of 21 and 45. Workers were rewarded and recognized via a ranking system based on the army.<ref name=\"Bellamy\">{{cite book|last=Bellamy|first=Edward|title=Looking Backward: 2000-1887|url=https://archive.org/details/lookingbackward01bellgoog|date=1888|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}</ref> Most importantly, the government is the most powerful and respected institution, necessary for providing and maintaining this [[utopia]].<ref name=\"History\"/> Arthur Lipow identifies the bureaucratic ruling of this ideal society as a quasi-military organization of both economic and social relations.<ref name=\"Lipow\">{{cite book|last=Lipow|first=Arthur|title=Authoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement|date=1991|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520075436}}</ref> Bellamy elevated the modern military as a catalyst for national interest.<ref name=\"Bellamy\"/>\n\nThe biggest critique of Bellamy's society is that it is based on the idea of socialism from above. The regime is imposed on the people by an expert elite and there is no democratic control or individual liberty. Lipow argues that this inherently leads to [[authoritarianism]], writing: \"If the workers and the vast majority were a brutish mass, there could be no question of forming a political movement out of them nor of giving them the task of creating a socialist society. The new institutions would not be created and shaped from below but would, of necessity, correspond to the plan laid down in advance by the utopian planner\".<ref name=\"Lipow\"/>\n\n=== Austrian and Chicago schools of economics ===\n[[Friedrich Hayek]], an Austrian-born economist, was one of the leading academic critics of [[collectivism]] in the 20th century.

When he visited Venezuela in May 1981, Hayek was asked to comment on the prevalence of totalitarian regimes in Latin America. In reply, Hayek warned against confusing \"totalitarianism with authoritarianism\" and said that he was unaware of \"any totalitarian governments in Latin America.

Other features that are common to modern authoritarian [[socialist states]] (starting in the 20th century) include an emphasis on [[heavy industry]] for [[Economic development|development]], a [[Single-party state|single-party system]] to propel the goals of the [[State (polity)|state]] forward, the extensive use of [[propaganda]] to do the same and more.<ref name=\"Huntington\"/><ref name=\"Lowy\"/><ref name=\"Amandae\"/>\n\nSoviet advocates and socialists responded to these criticisms by highlighting the ideological differences in the concept of [[Liberty#Politics|freedom]]. For instance, it was noted that \"[[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] norms disparaged ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[Liberal individualism|individualism]] (as when housing is determined by one's ability to pay)\" and condemned \"wide variations in personal wealth as the West has not\" whilst emphasizing equality, by which they meant \"free education and medical care, little disparity in housing or salaries, and so forth\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McFarland|first1=Sam|last2=Ageyev|first2=Vladimir|last3=Abalakina-Paap|first3=Marina|title=Authoritarianism in the former Soviet Union|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=63|issue=6|pages=1004\u20131010|date=1992|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.63.6.1004|citeseerx=10.1.1.397.4546}}</ref>\n\nWhen asked to comment on the claim that former citizens of socialist states now enjoy increased freedoms, [[Heinz Kessler]], former [[Ministry of National Defence (East Germany)|East German Minister of National Defence]], replied: \"Millions of people in Eastern Europe are now free from employment, free from safe streets, free from health care, free from social security\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Parenti|first=Michael|title=Blackshirts and Reds: Rational Fascism and the Overthrow of Communism|year=1997|publisher=City Lights Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0-87286-330-9|page=118}}</ref>\n\n=== Formation of industry ===\nAs authoritarian powers enforce socialist economics, the process often goes hand in hand with supporting the growth of heavy industry as a means of reaching [[industrialization]] (as can be seen with [[Joseph Stalin]]'s control of the [[Soviet Union]]).

The one-year plans contained schedules and details that addressed current production and market equilibrium issues. The five-year plans integrated the political, military and economic strategy that would be pursued in the next five years as well as changes in capacity and production rates. It was done by a team of around the fifty leading experts from all the departments, ministries, professional and scientific organizations.

It has been argued that authoritarian socialist states failed because they did not create rules and operational criteria for the efficient operation of [[state enterprise]]s in their administrative, command allocation of [[resources]] and [[commodities]] and the lack of [[democracy]] in the political systems that the authoritarian socialist economies were combined with.

The party makes all the decisions, but they should take into account the desires of the population and these desires were then to be weighted into the decision making. According to Article 11 of its [[1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1977 constitution]], the main goal of the [[Soviet Union]] was to \"raise the material and cultural standards of the working people\". Marxist thought and its interpretation by the Soviet Union dictated that private ownership was to be banned and the nationalization of all aspects of production a necessity, yet some things were not nationalized for the sake of economic efficiency or production targets. There was an emphasis on rapid industrialization, the development of heavy industry, relegation of consumer production as non-essential and collectivization of agriculture. [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economies]] also used a larger proportion of their resources on investment than do market economies. The issue with this was that current consumption was undercut because of the over-investment. All these actions supported the purposes of the state, not the people.<ref name=\"Ader\">Ader, Emile Bertrand (1970). ''Communism, Classic and Contemporary''. Woodbury: Barron's Educational Series. {{ISBN|9780812004038}}.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1940s\u20131970s, the [[economy of the Soviet Union]] grew at a rate that outpaced that of Western European nations, but by the 1980s the Soviet economy was in shambles. This has been attributed to the [[Era of Stagnation]], a more tolerant central government and increasing military spending caused by the [[nuclear arms race]] with the United States, especially under [[Ronald Reagan]], whose administration pursued more aggressive relations with the Soviet Union instead of [[d\u00e9tente]] that was preferred in the 1970s. The end to the [[post-war consensus]] and [[Keynesianism]] in the 1970s and the rise of [[neoliberalism]] and [[economic globalization]] in the 1980s also caused problems as they forced the Soviet Union and other countries to adapt and reform themselves. Unlike China, the Soviet's failure to do so further contributed to its dissolution in December 1991. Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union to guarantee employment to all of its labor force, it did not satisfy the human desires of its laborers because \"people want land, not collectivization. Consumers want goods, not gigantic industrial enterprise. Workers want better wages and higher living standards, not citations and medals.

[[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] was set apart because the first stage of its transition consisted of economic recovery and then socialism was gradually implemented. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] differed from other Eastern European countries in that after 1950 it modified its economic system by making self-management the base of enterprise activity.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/> There were also a few differences between the economic model of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries such as East Germany and Poland. Czechoslovakia and East Germany were administered along regional lines. Poland retained a centralized system similar to the Stalinist centralization of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Wellisz\"/> The Eastern European countries differed from the Soviet Union in that they had greater flexibility in the management of subordinate firms, the market was assigned a greater importance, accessible foreign trade and liberalization of the exchange of capital goods.

Aldershot; Burlington: Ashgate. {{ISBN|9780754636571}}.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], [[Mao Zedong]] condemned [[Stalinism]] and the flaws in the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] movement that peaked with the [[Hungarian Uprising of 1956]]. This gave Mao space in which to experiment with departure from the Soviet socialist economy. The Maoist economic model was reliant on ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' and ''Ten Great Relationships''. Mao modeled the Chinese socialist economy in such a way that it led to the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[People's commune|Commune Movement]]. In ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', Mao focused on the industrialization and mechanization of the countryside; in ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' wrote about his thoughts on the problems of socialist states as well as the conflicts of interest in the Chinese socialist society; and in ''Ten Great Relationships'' wrote about his vision of China's economy.<ref>Nove, Alec; Nuti, D. M. (1972). ''Socialist Economics''. Harmondsworth: Penguin. pp. 491\u2013510. {{ISBN|9780140806229}}.</ref>\n\nThe Maoist model had a dual economic goal, namely the industrialization of the countryside and the socialization of its people. It differed from the Soviet Union's goals in that Mao emphasized the [[class struggle]] against the [[bourgeoisie]] while the Soviet Union started advocating [[peaceful coexistence]]. China also allowed for more flexibility and experimentation than the Soviet Union and the countryside was at the center of its policies.<ref>Hoffmann, Charles (September 1971). \"The Maoist Economic Model\".

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n=== Economic challenges and legacy ===\nThe problem with the central planning of authoritarian socialist states is that as the state develops, it also grows in complexity and the possible errors grow and the possibilities of dis-allocations and waste of resources.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/> As commented by [[Karl Marx]], capitalism works because it is a system of economic force, but in socialist economics this force is insufficient to provide enough incentive. Human needs should be taken into account to make a socialist society function, but there is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital and human satisfaction.<ref>Ollman, Berell; Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel (1998).

New York: Routledge. pp. 60\u201362. {{ISBN|9780415919678}}.</ref> Some of the issues that emerged during the socialist phase of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and Maoist China included:\n* Inflation: Yugoslavia raised its industrial prices by 17% and its agricultural prices by 32% from 1964 to 1965 while Czechoslovakia raised the prices of foodstuffs and services by 20% in 1966 and by 1967 prices were up by 30%.\n* Lagged consumption: there was a lag between when products were fabricated and when they were accessed to by the population, goods tended to stockpile. The production of consumer products also diminished and in Yugoslavia the share of consumer products fell from 70% before World War II to 31% in 1965.\n* Fixing prices: prices were fixed under the premise that it would force producers to behave more efficiently and as such the price-controlled products were produced in lower quantities. In Yugoslavia, the market distortion caused by the price fixing was realized and led to the un-freezing of prices in 1967. Hungary also had frozen prices and slowly unfroze them over a period of ten to fifteen years because otherwise the structural disproportions of the Hungarian economy would spin prices out of control.\n* Production structure: many factories were kept running through government subsidies and protection despite any economic losses of the factories. This decreased overall efficiency of the socialist economies and also increased the financial losses of those economies.\n* Disproportionality: there was a disproportionate amount of available jobs and manpower. As argued by Ljubo Sirc, the \"Soviet Union and other communist countries have the worst of both worlds: some enterprises or operations are inefficient because they are too capital-intensive, other enterprises or operations because they are too labour-intensive\".<ref name=\"Sirc\"/>\n\nThe [[Stalinist]] economic model in which the socialist economies were based did not allow for a decrease in growth rates. It did not allow for the flexibility needed to keep up with growing economies.<ref name=\"Marangos\"/> Despite these shortcomings, the Soviet Union's growth in GDP per capita compared favorably with Western Europe.<ref name=\"Maddison\"/> It has also been noted that such states compared favorably with Western states in some health indicators such as [[infant mortality]] and [[life expectancy]],<ref>Ellman, Michael (2014).

Because of his control over both political and economic arenas which historians argue gave his vanguard party an amount of control surpassing that of [[Russian tsar|Russia's tzars or emperors]], citizens were unwilling to challenge his decrees, given that aspects of their lives such as medical care, housing and social freedoms could be restricted according to the discretion of the party.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nDespite failures, Stalin's expectations remained uncontested by the working class and the model was adopted by a multitude of emerging socialist states during that era.

He described his ideal system as \"a political situation in which there is both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unity of purpose and personal ease of mind and liveliness to facilitate the socialist revolution\".<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/> While the system advocates contradiction, Mao believed the state above all could provide the masses with the tools for their own expression, but his own brand of self-expression was wholly manufactured, built largely on replacing [[Chinese culture|traditional practices and artifacts]] with his own. Through this, transformation of the people towards an internal party collectiveness was possible.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/>\n\nNotably, Mao's authoritarianism was rooted in a collective bottom-up style of empowerment. In his system, the proletariat and peasantry were responsible for rising up against the bureaucracy and capital of the state.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Joining the peasant class with the [[bourgeoisie]] of the countryside (the land-holding, local farmers), the group was able to stifle the claims to power by the wealthier, urban landowners through the banner of [[communism]]. Only when this collection of [[peasant]]s and [[petty bourgeoisie]] existed could Mao grow his own, custom bureaucracy.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Once this unity was established, Mao argued that the people were the ones who could control the state, but his government's intense control over the citizenry emphasizes the contradiction in his theory\u2014a contradiction, he maintained, was a necessary reality of their specialized system <ref name=\"Esh\"/>\n\n=== Arab world ===\n{{see also|Arab socialism}}\nSocialism was introduced into the Middle East in the form of [[Populism|populist]] policies designed to galvanize the [[working class]] into overthrowing [[colonial powers]] and their domestic allies. These policies were held by authoritarian states interested in the rapid industrialization and social equalization of Arab nations and often were characterized by redistributive or protectionist economic policies, lower class mobilization, charismatic leaders and promises to improve national living standards.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\">{{cite book|last=King|first=Stephen J.|year=2009|title=The New Authoritarianism in The Middle East and North Africa|location=Bloomington|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253221469}}</ref> Those states were progressive in terms of the colonial development that had occurred thus far. They allowed important political and economic gains to be made by workers, encouraged land redistribution, unseated oligarchical political powers and implemented [[Import substitution industrialization|import-substituting]] industrialization development strategies.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/>\n\nWith the collapse of the [[Eastern Bloc]] following the [[Revolutions of 1989]] and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991 as well as the push for [[democratization]], many Arab states have moved toward a model of fiscal discipline proposed by the [[Washington Consensus]].<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/> Although authoritarian leaders of those states implemented democratic institutions during the 1980s and 1990s, their multi-party elections created an arena in which business elites could lobby for personal interests while largely silencing the lower class.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/> Economic liberalization in these regions yielded economies that led to regimes built on the support of rent-seeking urban elites, with political opposition inviting the prospect of political marginalization and even retaliation.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/>\n\n==== Resistance to democratization ====\n[[File:WOSM-WAGGGS-Arab Region.svg|thumb|[[Arab world]]]]\nA great deal of debate has been paid by the field of comparative politics to how the Arab region was able to avoid the [[Third Wave Democracy|third wave of democratization]].

His revision proved similar to that of [[Benito Mussolini]] as he called on a national movement from and for his one-party-ruled government, arguing: \"In a word, we must awaken the National Consciousness.

They reason that a socialist state is antithetical to socialism and that socialism will emerge spontaneously from the [[grassroots]] level in an [[Evolutionary economics|evolutionary manner]], developing its own unique political and economic institutions for a highly organized [[stateless society]]. Libertarian communists, including [[Anarcho-communism|anarchists]], [[Council communism|councillists]], [[Left communism|leftists]] and [[Libertarian Marxism|Marxists]], also reject the concept of a socialist state for being antithetical to socialism, but they believe that socialism and communism can only be established through [[revolution]] and dissolving the existence of the state.
