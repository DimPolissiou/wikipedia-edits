Ordered in 1934, it first flew in 1935 and entered service in 1937. At that point, it was the most advanced aircraft flying for the Navy and possibly for any navy in the world. However, the fast pace of aircraft development quickly caught up with it, and by the time of the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] the TBD was already outdated.\n\nThe Devastator performed well in early battles but earned notoriety for a catastrophic performance during the [[Battle of Midway]] in which 41 Devastators recorded zero torpedo hits and only six surviving to return to their carriers. Vastly outclassed in both speed and maneuverability by the [[Mitsubishi Zero]] fighters they faced, most of the force was wiped out with little consequence except to distract the Zeros from the [[SBD Dauntless]] [[dive bombers]] that sank four carriers and a heavy cruiser. Although much of the Devastator's dismal performance was later attributed to the many well-documented defects in the US [[Mark 13 torpedo]], the aircraft was withdrawn from frontline service after Midway, being replaced by the [[Grumman TBF Avenger]].\n\n==Design and development==\n[[File:Douglas XTBD-1 in flight 1935.jpeg|thumb|The XTBD-1 with the original flat canopy in 1935]]\n[[File:TBD-1 in flight Anacostia 1937.jpg|thumb|The first production TBD-1 in 1937]]\n[[File:TBD-1A floatplane in flight 1941.jpg|thumb|A single TBD-1A was tried as a floatplane]]\n\nThe Douglas XTBD-1 was ordered on 30 June 1934 after being one of the winners of a US Navy competition for new bombers to operate from its aircraft carriers.<ref>Doll 1967, p. 28.</ref> Other aircraft also ordered for production as a result of the competition included the [[Brewster SBA]], the [[Vought SB2U Vindicator]], and the [[Northrop BT-1]], the last of which would evolve into the [[Douglas SBD Dauntless]].<ref name=\"Doll p. 4\"/> The [[Great Lakes XB2G]], [[Great Lakes XTBG]], [[Grumman XSBF]], [[Hall XPTBH]] and [[Vought XSB3U]] were also tendered to the specification but were not developed beyond prototype status.<ref name=\"Doll p. 4\">Doll 1992, p. 4.</ref>\n\nThe XTBD Devastator flew for the first time on 15 April 1935 while  marking a number of \"firsts\" for the US Navy.<ref>Gunston 1976, p. 66.</ref> It was the first widely used carrier-based [[monoplane]], the first all-metal naval aircraft, the first with a completely enclosed cockpit, the first with power-actuated (hydraulically) folding wings.<ref name=\"Winchester p. 78\"/> A semi-retractable landing gear was fitted, with the wheels protruding {{cvt|10|in|mm}} below the wings to potentially limit damage to the aircraft in a \"[[belly landing|wheels-up]]\" landing. A crew of three was normally carried beneath a large \"greenhouse\" canopy almost half the length of the aircraft. The pilot sat in front; a rear gunner/radio operator took the rearmost position, while the bombardier occupied the middle seat. During a bombing run, the bombardier lay prone, sliding into position under the pilot to sight through a window in the bottom of the fuselage, using the [[Norden Bombsight]].<ref name=\"Winchester p. 79\"/>\n\nThe normal TBD offensive armament consisted of either a {{cvt|1935|lb}} [[Mark 13 torpedo|Bliss-Leavitt Mark 13]] [[aerial torpedo]] or a {{cvt|1000|lb}} bomb  carried semi-recessed in the fuselage undersides. Alternatively, three {{cvt|500|lb}} general-purpose bombs (one under each wing root and one inside the bomb bay), or twelve {{cvt|100|lb}} fragmentation bombs (six under each wing root), could be carried. This weapons load would often be used when attacking Japanese targets on the [[Gilbert Islands|Gilbert]] and [[Marshall Islands]] in 1942.<ref name=\"Winchester p. 79\">Winchester 2004, p. 79.</ref> Defensive armament consisted of a {{cvt|.30|in|2}} [[M1919 Browning machine gun|Browning machine gun]] for the rear gunner. Fitted in the starboard side of the cowling was either a {{cvt|.30|in|2}} or {{cvt|.50|in|1}} [[M2 Browning machine gun]].<ref name=\"Winchester p. 79\"/>\n\nThe powerplant was a {{cvt|850|hp}} [[Pratt & Whitney R-1830|Pratt & Whitney R-1830-64]] Twin Wasp [[radial engine]], a development of the prototype's {{cvt|800|hp}} [[Pratt & Whitney R-1830|Pratt & Whitney XR-1830-60/R-1830-1]].<ref name=\"Mondey 2006, p. 128\">Mondey 2006, p. 128.</ref> Other changes from the 1935 prototype included a revised engine cowling<ref>Taylor 1969, p. 485.</ref> and a raised cockpit canopy to improve visibility.<ref name=\"Winchester p. 78\"/>\n\nThe XTBD had a flat canopy that was replaced on production models by a higher, domed canopy with a rollover bar. Other than requests by test pilots to improve pilot visibility, the prototype easily passed its acceptance trials that ran from 24 April to 24 November 1935 at NAS (Naval Air Station) Anacostia and Norfolk bases. After successfully completing torpedo drop tests, the prototype was transferred to the {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|2}} for carrier certification.<ref>Doll 1967, p. 29.</ref> The extended service trials continued until 1937 with the first two production aircraft retained by the company exclusively for testing.<ref>Tillman 1973, p. 25.</ref>\n\nThe US Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) purchased 129 examples, and began to equip the carriers USS {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|2}}, {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|2}}, {{USS| Lexington|CV-2|2}}, {{USS|Wasp|CV-7|2}}, {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|2}}, {{USS|Yorktown|CV-5|2}} and {{USS|Ranger|CV-4|2}} starting in 1937. Even prewar, TBD units were being shifted to training duties with at least one aircraft being converted to target tug duty.<ref>Doll 1967, p. 32.</ref> By 1940, the US Navy was aware that the TBD had become outclassed and a replacement, the [[Grumman TBF Avenger]], was in the works, but it was not yet operational when the US entered [[World War II]]. Attrition had by then reduced their numbers to just over 100 aircraft.<ref>Tillman and Lawson 2001, p. 56.</ref> When the US Navy assigned popular names to its aircraft in late 1941, the TBD became the '''Devastator''', although its nickname \"torpecker\" was still commonly used.<ref>Tillman and Lawson 2001, p. 57.</ref>\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:TBD VT-6 over Wake Island 1942.jpg|thumb|A VT-6 TBD after attacking [[Wake Island]], 24 February 1942]]\n[[File:Yorktown TBD Huon Gulf March 1942.jpg|thumb|TBDs from VT-5 over the Huon Gulf, 10 March 1942]]\n[[File:TBD VT-3 Midway.jpg|thumb|A TBD-1 from VT-3 en route to the Japanese fleet at Midway]]\n[[File:Vt8tbd-t16-4june1942 waldron.jpg|thumb|right|VT-8's \"T-16\" (BuNo 1506, LCDR [[John C.

The twin .30 caliber machine guns in the rear was unique to VT-8.<ref name=\"Tillman p. 96\">Tillman 2000, p. 96.</ref>]]\n\nIn the early days of the Pacific war, the TBD acquitted itself well during February and March 1942, with TBDs from ''Enterprise'' and ''Yorktown'' attacking targets in the Marshall and Gilbert Islands, [[Wake Island|Wake]] and [[Marcus Island]]s, while TBDs from ''Yorktown'' and ''Lexington'' struck Japanese shipping off [[New Guinea]] on 10 March.<ref name=\"AI Mar90 p155\">''Air International'' March 1990, p. 155.</ref> In the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] Devastators helped sink the Japanese aircraft carrier {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Sh\u014dh\u014d||2}} on 7 May, but failed to hit another carrier, the {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Sh\u014dkaku||2}}, the next day.<ref name=\"prof p7-8\">Doll 1967, pp. 7\u20138.</ref>\n\nFaults were discovered with the [[Mark 13 torpedo]] at this point. Many were seen to hit the target yet failed to explode; there was also a tendency to run deeper than the set depth. It took over a year for the defects to be corrected. These problems were not fixed by the time of the [[Battle of Midway]] on 4 June 1942.\n\nAt Midway, a total of 41 Devastators, the majority of the type still operational, were launched from ''Hornet'', ''Enterprise'' and ''Yorktown'' to attack the Japanese fleet.<ref name=\"CV-6\"/> The sorties were not well coordinated, in part because Rear Admiral [[Raymond A. Spruance]] ordered a strike on the enemy carriers immediately after they were discovered, rather than spending time assembling a well-coordinated attack involving the different types of aircraft \u2013 fighters, bombers, torpedo planes \u2013 reasoning that attacking the Japanese would prevent a counterstrike against the US carriers. The TBDs from ''Hornet'' and ''Enterprise'' lost contact with their escort and started their attacks without fighter protection.<ref>Cressman et al. 1990, pp. 84\u201389.</ref><ref name=\"Sword p206-215\">Parshall and Tulley 2005, pp. 206\u2013215.</ref>\n\nThe Devastator proved to be a death trap for its crews: slow and hardly maneuverable, with poor armor for the era; its speed on a glide-bombing approach was a mere {{convert|200|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, making it easy prey for fighters and defensive guns alike. The aerial torpedo could not even be released at speeds above {{convert|115|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref>Jackson and Doll 1973, p. 5.</ref> Torpedo delivery requires a long, straight-line attack run, making the aircraft vulnerable, and the slow speed of the aircraft made them easy targets for the [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]]s. Only four TBDs made it back to ''Enterprise'', none to ''Hornet'' and two to ''Yorktown'', without scoring a torpedo hit.<ref>Buell 1987, p. 494.</ref>\n\nNonetheless, their sacrifice was not completely in vain, as several TBDs managed to get within a few ship-lengths range of their targets before dropping their torpedoes, being close enough to be able to strafe the enemy ships and force the Japanese carriers to take sharp evasive maneuvers.<ref>[http://www.cv6.org/1942/midway/midway_3.htm \"USS Enterprise CV-6: The Most Decorated Ship of the Second World War, p. 3.\"] ''cv6.org''. Retrieved: 7 June 2010.</ref> By obliging the Japanese to keep their flight decks clear and to continually cycle and reinforce their [[combat air patrol]]s, they prevented any Japanese counter-attacks against the American carriers, just as Spruance had anticipated. These windows of opportunity were exploited by the late-arriving Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers led by [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[C. Wade McClusky]] and [[Max Leslie]], which dive-bombed and fatally damaged three of the four Japanese carriers about one hour after the first TBD torpedo attacks had developed.<ref>Parshall and Tully 2005, pp. 215\u2013216, 226\u2013227.</ref> While the Devastators faced the stiff defenses of the carriers and their fighters, their attacks served to distract the Japanese attention from the Dauntless dive bombers' strikes, resulting in relatively lighter resistance from the IJN carriers' defensive fighter patrols, and more effective American attacks that crippled the IJN carrier forces.\n\n===Obsolescence===\nThe Navy immediately withdrew the 39 remaining TBDs from frontline units after the debacle at Midway. The surviving Devastators in VT-4 and VT-7 remained in service briefly in the Atlantic and in training squadrons until 1944.<ref>Doll 1967, p. 34.</ref> Many were relegated to training duties for pilots and mechanics or were destroyed following use as instructional airframes for firefighting training. By late 1944, no TBD Devastators were left in the US Navy inventory.<ref name=\"Tillman p. 61\">Tillman and Lawson 2001, p. 61.</ref> The original prototype finished its career at [[University of Oklahoma Westheimer Airport|NAS Norman]], [[Oklahoma]]; the last TBD in the US Navy was used by the Commander of Fleet Air Activities-West Coast.

Ordered in 1934, it first flew in 1935 and entered service in 1937. At that point, it was the most advanced aircraft flying for the Navy and possibly for any navy in the world. However, the fast pace of aircraft development quickly caught up with it, and by the time of the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] the TBD was already outdated.\n\nThe Devastator performed well in early battles but earned notoriety for a catastrophic performance during the [[Battle of Midway]] in which 41 Devastators recorded zero torpedo hits and only six surviving to return to their carriers. Vastly outclassed in both speed and maneuverability by the [[Mitsubishi Zero]] fighters they faced, most of the force was wiped out with little consequence except to distract the Zeros from the [[SBD Dauntless]] [[dive bombers]] that sank four carriers and a heavy cruiser. Although much of the Devastator's dismal performance was later attributed to the many well-documented defects in the US [[Mark 13 torpedo]], the aircraft was withdrawn from frontline service after Midway, being replaced by the [[Grumman TBF Avenger]].\n\n==Design and development==\n[[File:Douglas XTBD-1 in flight 1935.jpeg|thumb|The XTBD-1 with the original flat canopy in 1935]]\n[[File:TBD-1 in flight Anacostia 1937.jpg|thumb|The first production TBD-1 in 1937]]\n[[File:TBD-1A floatplane in flight 1941.jpg|thumb|A single TBD-1A was tried as a floatplane]]\n\nThe Douglas XTBD-1 was ordered on 30 June 1934 after being one of the winners of a US Navy competition for new bombers to operate from its aircraft carriers.<ref>Doll 1967, p. 28.</ref> Other aircraft also ordered for production as a result of the competition included the [[Brewster SBA]], the [[Vought SB2U Vindicator]], and the [[Northrop BT-1]], the last of which would evolve into the [[Douglas SBD Dauntless]].<ref name=\"Doll p. 4\"/> The [[Great Lakes XB2G]], [[Great Lakes XTBG]], [[Grumman XSBF]], [[Hall XPTBH]] and [[Vought XSB3U]] were also tendered to the specification but were not developed beyond prototype status.<ref name=\"Doll p. 4\">Doll 1992, p. 4.</ref>\n\nThe XTBD Devastator flew for the first time on 15 April 1935 while  marking a number of \"firsts\" for the US Navy.<ref>Gunston 1976, p. 66.</ref> It was the first widely used carrier-based [[monoplane]], the first all-metal naval aircraft, the first with a completely enclosed cockpit, the first with power-actuated (hydraulically) folding wings.<ref name=\"Winchester p. 78\"/> A semi-retractable landing gear was fitted, with the wheels protruding {{cvt|10|in|mm}} below the wings to to potentially limit damage to the aircraft in a \"[[belly landing|wheels-up]]\" landing. A crew of three was normally carried beneath a large \"greenhouse\" canopy almost half the length of the aircraft. The pilot sat in front; a rear gunner/radio operator took the rearmost position, while the bombardier occupied the middle seat. During a bombing run, the bombardier lay prone, sliding into position under the pilot to sight through a window in the bottom of the fuselage, using the [[Norden Bombsight]].<ref name=\"Winchester p. 79\"/>\n\nThe normal TBD offensive armament consisted of either a {{cvt|1935|lb}} [[Mark 13 torpedo|Bliss-Leavitt Mark 13]] [[aerial torpedo]] or a {{cvt|1000|lb}} bomb  carried semi-recessed in the fuselage undersides. Alternatively, three {{cvt|500|lb}} general-purpose bombs (one under each wing root and one inside the bomb bay), or twelve {{cvt|100|lb}} fragmentation bombs (six under each wing root), could be carried. This weapons load would often be used when attacking Japanese targets on the [[Gilbert Islands|Gilbert]] and [[Marshall Islands]] in 1942.<ref name=\"Winchester p. 79\">Winchester 2004, p. 79.</ref> Defensive armament consisted of a {{cvt|.30|in|2}} [[M1919 Browning machine gun|Browning machine gun]] for the rear gunner. Fitted in the starboard side of the cowling was either a {{cvt|.30|in|2}} or {{cvt|.50|in|1}} [[M2 Browning machine gun]].<ref name=\"Winchester p. 79\"/>\n\nThe powerplant was a {{cvt|850|hp}} [[Pratt & Whitney R-1830|Pratt & Whitney R-1830-64]] Twin Wasp [[radial engine]], a development of the prototype's {{cvt|800|hp}} [[Pratt & Whitney R-1830|Pratt & Whitney XR-1830-60/R-1830-1]].<ref name=\"Mondey 2006, p. 128\">Mondey 2006, p. 128.</ref> Other changes from the 1935 prototype included a revised engine cowling<ref>Taylor 1969, p. 485.</ref> and a raised cockpit canopy to improve visibility.<ref name=\"Winchester p. 78\"/>\n\nThe XTBD had a flat canopy that was replaced on production models by a higher, domed canopy with a rollover bar. Other than requests by test pilots to improve pilot visibility, the prototype easily passed its acceptance trials that ran from 24 April to 24 November 1935 at NAS (Naval Air Station) Anacostia and Norfolk bases. After successfully completing torpedo drop tests, the prototype was transferred to the {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|2}} for carrier certification.<ref>Doll 1967, p. 29.</ref> The extended service trials continued until 1937 with the first two production aircraft retained by the company exclusively for testing.<ref>Tillman 1973, p. 25.</ref>\n\nThe US Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) purchased 129 examples, and began to equip the carriers USS {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|2}}, {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|2}}, {{USS| Lexington|CV-2|2}}, {{USS|Wasp|CV-7|2}}, {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|2}}, {{USS|Yorktown|CV-5|2}} and {{USS|Ranger|CV-4|2}} starting in 1937. Even prewar, TBD units were being shifted to training duties with at least one aircraft being converted to target tug duty.<ref>Doll 1967, p. 32.</ref> By 1940, the US Navy was aware that the TBD had become outclassed and a replacement, the [[Grumman TBF Avenger]], was in the works, but it was not yet operational when the US entered [[World War II]]. Attrition had by then reduced their numbers to just over 100 aircraft.<ref>Tillman and Lawson 2001, p. 56.</ref> When the US Navy assigned popular names to its aircraft in late 1941, the TBD became the '''Devastator''', although its nickname \"torpecker\" was still commonly used.<ref>Tillman and Lawson 2001, p. 57.</ref>\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:TBD VT-6 over Wake Island 1942.jpg|thumb|A VT-6 TBD after attacking [[Wake Island]], 24 February 1942]]\n[[File:Yorktown TBD Huon Gulf March 1942.jpg|thumb|TBDs from VT-5 over the Huon Gulf, 10 March 1942]]\n[[File:TBD VT-3 Midway.jpg|thumb|A TBD-1 from VT-3 en route to the Japanese fleet at Midway]]\n[[File:Vt8tbd-t16-4june1942 waldron.jpg|thumb|right|VT-8's \"T-16\" (BuNo 1506, LCDR [[John C.

The twin .30 caliber machine guns in the rear was unique to VT-8.<ref name=\"Tillman p. 96\">Tillman 2000, p. 96.</ref>]]\n\nIn the early days of the Pacific war, the TBD acquitted itself well during February and March 1942, with TBDs from ''Enterprise'' and ''Yorktown'' attacking targets in the Marshall and Gilbert Islands, [[Wake Island|Wake]] and [[Marcus Island]]s, while TBDs from ''Yorktown'' and ''Lexington'' struck Japanese shipping off [[New Guinea]] on 10 March.<ref name=\"AI Mar90 p155\">''Air International'' March 1990, p. 155.</ref> In the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] Devastators helped sink the Japanese aircraft carrier {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Sh\u014dh\u014d||2}} on 7 May, but failed to hit another carrier, the {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Sh\u014dkaku||2}}, the next day.<ref name=\"prof p7-8\">Doll 1967, pp. 7\u20138.</ref>\n\nFaults were discovered with the [[Mark 13 torpedo]] at this point. Many were seen to hit the target yet failed to explode; there was also a tendency to run deeper than the set depth. It took over a year for the defects to be corrected. These problems were not fixed by the time of the [[Battle of Midway]] on 4 June 1942.\n\nAt Midway, a total of 41 Devastators, the majority of the type still operational, were launched from ''Hornet'', ''Enterprise'' and ''Yorktown'' to attack the Japanese fleet.<ref name=\"CV-6\"/> The sorties were not well coordinated, in part because Rear Admiral [[Raymond A. Spruance]] ordered a strike on the enemy carriers immediately after they were discovered, rather than spending time assembling a well-coordinated attack involving the different types of aircraft \u2013 fighters, bombers, torpedo planes \u2013 reasoning that attacking the Japanese would prevent a counterstrike against the US carriers. The TBDs from ''Hornet'' and ''Enterprise'' lost contact with their escort and started their attacks without fighter protection.<ref>Cressman et al. 1990, pp. 84\u201389.</ref><ref name=\"Sword p206-215\">Parshall and Tulley 2005, pp. 206\u2013215.</ref>\n\nThe Devastator proved to be a death trap for its crews: slow and hardly maneuverable, with poor armor for the era; its speed on a glide-bombing approach was a mere {{convert|200|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, making it easy prey for fighters and defensive guns alike. The aerial torpedo could not even be released at speeds above {{convert|115|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref>Jackson and Doll 1973, p. 5.</ref> Torpedo delivery requires a long, straight-line attack run, making the aircraft vulnerable, and the slow speed of the aircraft made them easy targets for the [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]]s. Only four TBDs made it back to ''Enterprise'', none to ''Hornet'' and two to ''Yorktown'', without scoring a torpedo hit.<ref>Buell 1987, p. 494.</ref>\n\nNonetheless, their sacrifice was not completely in vain, as several TBDs managed to get within a few ship-lengths range of their targets before dropping their torpedoes, being close enough to be able to strafe the enemy ships and force the Japanese carriers to take sharp evasive maneuvers.<ref>[http://www.cv6.org/1942/midway/midway_3.htm \"USS Enterprise CV-6: The Most Decorated Ship of the Second World War, p. 3.\"] ''cv6.org''. Retrieved: 7 June 2010.</ref> By obliging the Japanese to keep their flight decks clear and to continually cycle and reinforce their [[combat air patrol]]s, they prevented any Japanese counter-attacks against the American carriers, just as Spruance had anticipated. These windows of opportunity were exploited by the late-arriving Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers led by [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[C. Wade McClusky]] and [[Max Leslie]], which dive-bombed and fatally damaged three of the four Japanese carriers about one hour after the first TBD torpedo attacks had developed.<ref>Parshall and Tully 2005, pp. 215\u2013216, 226\u2013227.</ref> While the Devastators faced the stiff defenses of the carriers and their fighters, their attacks served to distract the Japanese attention from the Dauntless dive bombers' strikes, resulting in relatively lighter resistance from the IJN carriers' defensive fighter patrols, and more effective American attacks that crippled the IJN carrier forces.\n\n===Obsolescence===\nThe Navy immediately withdrew the 39 remaining TBDs from frontline units after the debacle at Midway. The surviving Devastators in VT-4 and VT-7 remained in service briefly in the Atlantic and in training squadrons until 1944.<ref>Doll 1967, p. 34.</ref> Many were relegated to training duties for pilots and mechanics or were destroyed following use as instructional airframes for firefighting training. By late 1944, no TBD Devastators were left in the US Navy inventory.<ref name=\"Tillman p. 61\">Tillman and Lawson 2001, p. 61.</ref> The original prototype finished its career at [[University of Oklahoma Westheimer Airport|NAS Norman]], [[Oklahoma]]; the last TBD in the US Navy was used by the Commander of Fleet Air Activities-West Coast.
