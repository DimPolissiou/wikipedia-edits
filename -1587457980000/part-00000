Brown was the youngest ever Australian Olympic sailing medalist until [[Elise Rechichi]] won gold in 2008. Brown was selected to represent Australia as a competitor in the 1980 Olympic Games for the Flying Dutchman Class.(http://www.mysailing.com.au/olympics/munich-1976-bertrand-takes-bronze-amid-tight-security). He represented Australia as a substitute competitor at the 1984 Olympic Games. He was an Olympic sailing coach at the 1988 Olympic Games for the Star and Flying Dutchman disciplines. Brown was a substitute competitor and coach at the 1992 Olympic Games. He worked with Great Britain (Glenn Charles), New Zealand (Rod Davis), Bermuda (Peter Bromby), Bahamas(Mark Holowesko) and Australian (Colin Beashel), Star Class Olympic representatives on the 1996 Olympic site just prior to Olympic racing (accreditation was with the Bermudan Olympic Sailing during the 1996 racing.) Brown was invited back to take charge of winning medals across all sailing disciplines for Sailing Australia and the National Sporting systems at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.<ref>australiansailingteam.com.au   \"Olympians\"</ref>\n\n\nAs well as his parents Brown credits Bruce Hewish of Freshwater Sails, Hugh Treharne of Blue Peter Sails, and Patrick Mayes, a notable tax law accountant, as adding defining development abilities to himself and career. The later was a financial benefactor enabling Brown to compete successfully in the Etchells class, often beating many of the best sailboat racers in the world such as Dennis Conner, Colin Beashel, David Curtis, John Bertrand, Iain Murray and Peter Gilmore.\n[[File:Ettch112.jpg|thumb|Brown, Andrew York and David Giles won two consecutive NSW Championships then second overall in the third.]]\n\n\nBrown's first title was an Australian Championship win in the Flying Ant Class in 1968 at Perth. He was 5th in interdominion Cherub class in 1969 and a Moth class world junior champion in 1970 before going on to win the World senior Moth Class Championship in 1972/3 at 18 years old. Ian designed, built and raced several \"skiff\" Moth designs. Ian's win was the first ever \"skiff\" moth to win a World Championship in the southern hemisphere, contested at Napier, New Zealand. He backed this up with a second place at Stockholm, Sweden in 1974. In 1975 he  was 2nd in the Australian OK dinghy  championships and later 3rd place in the Okinawa, Japan, Moth Worlds before beginning training in the 470 class with Ian Ruff. Early in 1976, after four months training they won both the Australian title and Olympic 470 selection regattas to secure Ian's first Olympian status. He, with crew and equipment owner Martin Burke, was 5th overall in the 1977 World 505 Class championships, La Rochelle, France. By 1980 he had won selection in the Flying Dutchman discipline for the Olympic Games, after which he began his sailmaking business. He was 4th Overall in the 1982 Flying Dutchman Class World Championships, Geelong, Australia. Later in the 1980s Ian was asked and spent a sailing season racing the 16ft skiff Buckle Toyota achieving a podium placing in the NSW championships at Yarra Bay. He, with crew John Dorling and Barry Watson, were 2nd in the 1993 Etchells Class World Championship, Brisbane, Australia. He raced many other sailboats to State and National titles wins. His most recent National Title wins are in the Farr 40 as tactician 2005, stepping in to skipper four heats with Martin Burke for Ian McCrossin and his team to win a Dragon Class Prince Philip Cup on Sydney Harbour, and two National titles in the SB20 class. By arrangement Ian bought and crewed the SB20, giving the skipper role to Nathan Outteridge. They won the 2011 Nationals, (https://www.sail-world.com/Asia/Australias-Outteridge-looks-the-goods-for-SB3-Worlds/-82529), King of Docklands and Geelong Week SB20 regattas in the year Nathan won a moth worlds. Nathan then went on to win Olympic 49er Gold and Silver medals in the following Olympiads. Interestingly Ian and Nathan put in a rushed SB20 charterboat effort with Tom Slingsby, who boasted his first attempt at being a forwardhand, during the 2011 SB20 World Championships at Torquay UK. For winning the 2013 Nationals Ian went back to skippering: \"The pre-regatta favourite, Brown and his crew of twin brothers Patrick Conway (bow & tactics) and Alex (mainsheet & tactics) and Scott Cotton (fourth hand) sailed a classy series with few errors. Their final scorecard of 19 points, a whopping 32.5 points from the nearest threat, proved an unclimbable mountain.\" (http://www.mysailing.com.au/news/ian-brown-wins-sb20-national-championship-in-melbourne#cEzGHX6BhXTPBDKS.99)\n\nIan began coaching for class association, State and the National Sailing associations in 1974. He began Olympic coaching on request from Colin Beashel for his Star Class efforts. Ian best coaching was each of three World 49er Championship wins by Chris Nicholson (two with Daniel Phillips and one with Ed Smyth). In one of these years he also coached the Star Class World Championship win by Colin Beashel and David Giles in Slovenia. A personal highlight during this time was finding a wealthy owner/crew for Colin's involvement and win, and Ian Brown's second place at the 1993 World Etchells Championships. Both were using a full set of sails from Ian's own sail loft. They worked collaboratively in training, and warming up just before each world championship race. Ian also worked for Olympic medalist, Americas Cup tactician and Round the World Race winner John Kostecki (with crew Tom Olsen) for a very close 2nd place at 1996 USA Star Class Olympic Games selection regatta. He also coached numerous Olympic classes to international regatta podium placings.\n\nOver the fourteen years of existence, the sails and his design work from Ian Brown's sail loft, One Design & Skiff Sails Pty Ltd, had world championship wins in the 505 Class, 420 Class, Moth Class, 14ft Skiff, Flying 15, and Etchell Classes. \n\n[[File:Lfetme10.jpg|thumb|Ian Brown on right, invited and made his system work well for Victor Kovalenko. Victor achieved both Mens and Womens Olympic 470 Gold Medals. Sydney 2000 Olympic Games.]]In 1997 Ian was selected as the Yachting Australia Head Coach charged to develop and implement an Australian Olympic Sailing development program that would win as many sailing Olympic Medals as possible at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games (John Boultbee reference document). Ian and his administrator reported to an independent board made up from senior sport funding executives from the Australian Olympic Committee Craig Phillips, the Australian Institute of Sport Geoff Strang, the NSW institute of Sport Michael Scott and, Chief executive of Yachting Australia Phillip Jones(Geoff Strang reference document). At a sailing funding level, the plan submitted by Ian and his administrator achieved the then, by far, biggest ever sailing based \"Special Initiatives\" Grant from the Australian Olympic Committee which allowed far greater depth of sailing coaching and equipment projects than had ever been conducted. At a home Games all Olympic Sailing disciplines are represented. His program, at that time, produced the best ever Australian medal haul for Sailing at an Olympic Games as well as in the lead up world championship regattas. It included World Championship wins and podium placings in the former most weak of Australian Olympic sailing disciplines. Two of the prior lesser performing disciplines achieved Olympic Gold medals. He was responsible for inviting and achieving both Trisha Leahy Hong Kong's sailboarding Gold Medallist's Sports psychologist and Ukrainian gold medal winning coach Victor Kovalenko (The Medal Maker) onto his team and Victor to move to Australia. Due to the increasing number of female athletes involved in Olympic sailing disciplines Ian spent considerable time discussing coaching with the females involved and with their endorsement asked Dutch born coach Erik Stibbe onto his program. Erik was coach to the Laser discipline and Michael Blackburn's Olympic Bronze medal, as well as the Europe Class and its representative(Trisha Leahy personal reference). Ian was also responsible for the first ever National Olympic Sailing Training Base at HMAS Penguin (approved by Brigadier Adrian d'Hage), and the first ever full-time Olympic sailing coaching programs across the Olympic squad. While overseas, he met with numerous country Olympic sailing program managers and formed a Danish Australian cooperative agreement, subsequently signed off between the Danish and Australian Olympic Committees. This shared some of their sailing resources when teams in Europe or in Australia. This agreement brought the potential Australian Sailing Olympians for the first time to practice dormitory living together as at the Olympic Games, and receive sport science appraisals while in Europe. His program was recongised by the Australian Institute of Sport for delivering a sports science program that was the most improved of all Australian Olympic Sports and was asked and gave a seminar to all Olympic sports head coaches or managers at Canberra on his planning and this international cooperation. As a result of the success of Ian's program, its athletes' performances and staff, Yachting Australia was awarded a position as one of the exclusive Olympic sports within the Australian Institute of Sport.\n\nQuotes:[[File:Lfetme1.jpg|thumb|2000 Olympic Sailing Program        Architect & Head Coach]]Re Strategic Plan. \" Dear Ian, Thank you for sending me the strategic Plan. I am please to see this amount of planning and the thought going into it. It makes it a lot easier to support sailing.\" John Boultbee, Director of Australian Institute of Sport.\n\nRe: Implementation. \"He also successfully initiated and implemented a unique, cohesive, strategic, and positive evaluation and review system.\"   Trisha Leahy, Senior Psychologist, Australian Institute of Sport. Now CEO the Hong Kong Sports Institute, and with a global profile.\n\nRe: Strategic focus. \"Ian did a remarkable job in keeping the program focused on both long and short tern goals in the lead up to the Olympics. Our results in the sport were the best ever at Olympic Level.\"  \nGeoff Strang, Director Sport Management Division, Aust Institute of Sport and part of management team over-sighting funding and implementation of Ian's designed Australian Olympic Sailing program.\n\nRe: Athlete opinion. \"Ian always had his door open. Regularly, he reassessed his own place in the sailing team, assisted by confidential reviews with participants. Thereby he successfully measured the quality of his own work and made adjustments to the systems that were in place, where necessary. As a consequence the sailing team developed considerably from 1996 (before Ian came on board) to 2000.\"  Michael Blackburn, 2000 Olympic Games Laser Class Bronze Medalist.\n\nPersonally Ian was awarded an International Olympic Committee Certificate of Merit for his efforts and very high level collaborations in regard of the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.\n\n<br />\n\n[[File:505BarcelMeElWells1 (5).jpg|thumb|Ian Brown, with UK naval architecture university student Elliot Wells, International 505 racing in Barcelona August 2019]]\n\nAfter more than a decade of medical issues including a problematic spine operation, prostate cancer and two years of frozen shoulder Ian competed in 4 International 505 regattas in Europe and Denmark during July and August 2019. His first traditional dinghy sailing and racing regatta after 35 years was at Riva Del Garda with expert German crew Holger Jess. Most memorable moment during this tour was a renewed friendship with world famous Spanish Olympic sailing coach Paul Maes, now famously known as \"The Doreste coach\" but also a sailing coach to Spanish royalty, and being told that at the 1976 Olympic Games, when Brown achieved Bronze, Paul had coached the Spanish 470 silver medalist Antonio Gorostegui.\n\nIan has spent considerable time racing with or assisting other younger sailing competitors such as Glenn Bourke (later becoming multiple world Laser Class champion and Olympian); Malcolm Page (later becoming Australia's first ever sailing dual Olympic Gold medalist); offered his own crewing and sports boat sailing equipment to Nathan Outteridge (later became Olympic Gold and Silver Medalist plus Americas cup helmsman); offered his laser class equipment to Australian Olympic representative Sarah Blank for pre Games use in Europe. \n\n\nCurrently Ian has casual consulting/mentor, for elite sailboat racing skills and life, relationships with a number of young emerging elite sailing athletes.\n\n{{Infobox sailor\n| birth_date     = {{birth-date and age|4 April 1954}}\n<ref>470 The Great Book, Alain Corcuff and Nicolas Guichet.

In 1975 he  was 2nd in the Australian OK dinghy  championships and later 3rd place in the Okinawa, Japan, Moth Worlds before beginning training in the 470 class with Ian Ruff. Early in 1976, after four months training they won both the Australian title and Olympic 470 selection regattas to secure Ian's first Olympian status. He, with crew and equipment owner Martin Burke, was 5th overall in the 1977 World 505 Class championships, La Rochelle, France. By 1980 he had won selection in the Flying Dutchman discipline for the Olympic Games, after which he began his sailmaking business. He was 4th Overall in the 1982 Flying Dutchman Class World Championships, Geelong, Australia. Later in the 1980s Ian was asked and spent a sailing season racing the 16ft skiff Buckle Toyota achieving a podium placing in the NSW championships at Yarra Bay. He, with crew John Dorling and Barry Watson, were 2nd in the 1993 Etchells Class World Championship, Brisbane, Australia. He raced many other sailboats to State and National titles wins. His most recent National Title wins are in the Farr 40 as tactician 2005, stepping in to skipper four heats with Martin Burke for Ian McCrossin and his team to win a Dragon Class Prince Philip Cup on Sydney Harbour, and two National titles in the SB20 class. By arrangement Ian bought and crewed the SB20, giving the skipper role to Nathan Outteridge. They won the 2011 Nationals, (https://www.sail-world.com/Asia/Australias-Outteridge-looks-the-goods-for-SB3-Worlds/-82529), King of Docklands and Geelong Week SB20 regattas in the year Nathan won a moth worlds. Nathan then went on to win Olympic 49er Gold and Silver medals in the following Olympiads. Interestingly Ian and Nathan put in a rushed SB20 charterboat effort with Tom Slingsby, who boasted his first attempt at being a forwardhand, during the 2011 SB20 World Championships at Torquay UK. For winning the 2013 Nationals Ian went back to skippering: \"The pre-regatta favourite, Brown and his crew of twin brothers Patrick Conway (bow & tactics) and Alex (mainsheet & tactics) and Scott Cotton (fourth hand) sailed a classy series with few errors. Their final scorecard of 19 points, a whopping 32.5 points from the nearest threat, proved an unclimbable mountain.\" (http://www.mysailing.com.au/news/ian-brown-wins-sb20-national-championship-in-melbourne#cEzGHX6BhXTPBDKS.99)\n\nIan began coaching for class association, State and the National Sailing associations in 1974. He began Olympic coaching on request from Colin Beashel for his Star Class efforts. Ian best coaching was each of three World 49er Championship wins by Chris Nicholson (two with Daniel Phillips and one with Ed Smyth). In one of these years he also coached the Star Class World Championship win by Colin Beashel and David Giles in Slovenia. A personal highlight during this time was finding a wealthy owner/crew for Colin's involvement and win, and Ian Brown's second place at the 1993 World Etchells Championships. Both were using a full set of sails from Ian's own sail loft. They worked collaboratively in training, and warming up just before each world championship race. Ian also worked for Olympic medalist, Americas Cup tactician and Round the World Race winner John Kostecki (with crew Tom Olsen) for a very close 2nd place at 1996 USA Star Class Olympic Games selection regatta. He also coached numerous Olympic classes to international regatta podium placings.\n\nOver the fourteen years of existence, the sails and his design work from Ian Brown's sail loft, One Design & Skiff Sails Pty Ltd, had world championship wins in the 505 Class, 420 Class, Moth Class, 14ft Skiff, Flying 15, and Etchell Classes. \n\n[[File:Lfetme10.jpg|thumb|Ian Brown on right, invited and made his system work well for Victor Kovalenko. Victor achieved both Mens and Womens Olympic 470 Gold Medals. Sydney 2000 Olympic Games.]]In 1997 Ian was selected as the Yachting Australia Head Coach charged to develop and implement an Australian Olympic Sailing development program that would win as many sailing Olympic Medals as possible at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games (John Boultbee reference document). Ian and his administrator reported to an independent board made up from senior sport funding executives from the Australian Olympic Committee Craig Phillips, the Australian Institute of Sport Geoff Strang, the NSW institute of Sport Michael Scott and, Chief executive of Yachting Australia Phillip Jones(Geoff Strang reference document). At a sailing funding level, the plan submitted by Ian and his administrator achieved the then, by far, biggest ever sailing based \"Special Initiatives\" Grant from the Australian Olympic Committee which allowed far greater depth of sailing coaching and equipment projects than had ever been conducted. At a home Games all Olympic Sailing disciplines are represented. His program, at that time, produced the best ever Australian medal haul for Sailing at an Olympic Games as well as in the lead up world championship regattas. It included World Championship wins and podium placings in the former most weak of Australian Olympic sailing disciplines. Two of the prior lesser performing disciplines achieved Olympic Gold medals. He was responsible for inviting and achieving both Trisha Leahy Hong Kong's sailboarding Gold Medallist's Sports psychologist and Ukrainian gold medal winning coach Victor Kovalenko (The Medal Maker) onto his team and Victor to move to Australia. Due to the increasing number of female athletes involved in Olympic sailing disciplines Ian spent considerable time discussing coaching with the females involved and with their endorsement asked Dutch born coach Erik Stibbe onto his program. Erik was coach to the Laser discipline and Michael Blackburn's Olympic Bronze medal, as well as the Europe Class and its representative(Trisha Leahy personal reference). Ian was also responsible for the first ever National Olympic Sailing Training Base at HMAS Penguin (approved by Brigadier Adrian d'Hage), and the first ever full-time Olympic sailing coaching programs across the Olympic squad. While overseas, he met with numerous country Olympic sailing program managers and formed a Danish Australian cooperative agreement, subsequently signed off between the Danish and Australian Olympic Committees. This shared some of their sailing resources when teams in Europe or in Australia. This agreement brought the potential Australian Sailing Olympians for the first time to practice dormitory living together as at the Olympic Games, and receive sport science appraisals while in Europe. His program was recongised by the Australian Institute of Sport for delivering a sports science program that was the most improved of all Australian Olympic Sports and was asked and gave a seminar to all Olympic sports head coaches or managers at Canberra on his planning and this international cooperation. As a result of the success of Ian's program, its athletes' performances and staff, Yachting Australia was awarded a position as one of the exclusive Olympic sports within the Australian Institute of Sport.\n\nQuotes:[[File:Lfetme1.jpg|thumb|2000 Olympic Sailing Program        Architect & Head Coach]]Re Strategic Plan. \" Dear Ian, Thank you for sending me the strategic Plan.

Regularly, he reassessed his own place in the sailing team, assisted by confidential reviews with participants. Thereby he successfully measured the quality of his own work and made adjustments to the systems that were in place, where necessary.

His first traditional dinghy sailing and racing regatta after 35 years was at Riva Del Garda with expert German crew Holger Jess. Most memorable moment during this tour was a renewed friendship with world famous Spanish Olympic sailing coach Paul Maes, now famously known as \"The Doreste coach\" but also a sailing coach to Spanish royalty, and being told that at the 1976 Olympic Games, when Brown achieved Bronze, Paul had coached the Spanish 470 silver medalist Antonio Gorostegui.\n\nIan has spent considerable time racing with or assisting other younger sailing competitors such as Glenn Bourke (later becoming multiple world Laser Class champion and Olympian); Malcolm Page (later becoming Australia's first ever sailing dual Olympic Gold medalist); offered his own crewing and sports boat sailing equipment to Nathan Outteridge (later became Olympic Gold and Silver Medalist plus Americas cup helmsman); offered his laser class equipment to Australian Olympic representative Sarah Blank for pre Games use in Europe. \n\n\nCurrently Ian has casual consulting/mentor, for elite sailboat racing skills and life, relationships with a number of young emerging elite sailing athletes.\n\n{{Infobox sailor\n| birth_date     = {{birth-date and age|4 April 1954}}\n<ref>470 The Great Book, Alain Corcuff and Nicolas Guichet.

This early style grew from the sound that was pushed in nightclubs in the North and the Midlands during the late 90s that played speed garage mixed with melodic vocal house. Most early bassline house tracks  simply expanded on this as many tracks feature either 'warp' or 'reese' speed garage basslines, or the [[Korg M1]] style organ lead. This led to many releases having a 'warper' mix along with an 'organ' mix of the same track. Like most electronic music, sampling played a big part, as lots of the same sampled basslines can be heard in old speed garage and bassline house releases.\n\nTowards the end of the 2000s, a new wave of younger producers such as TS7, Service Crew, Danny bond and others coupled with the rise of [[Digital audio workstations]], which reduced the use of drum machine samples and old sampled basslines, took bassline to a different path. This style started to be called '4x4', moving further away from the original speed garage sound, but still retaining the core elements such as the warping basslines and female vocals. In general, bassline as a whole remained fairly underground and was mostly only popular in the North and Midlands, and releases often never went beyond a 12\" vinyl EP, or featuring on obscure CD mixes or compilations.

This early style grew from the sound that was pushed in nightclubs in the North and the Midlands during the late 90s that played speed garage mixed with melodic vocal house. Most early bassline house tracks  simply expanded on this as many tracks feature either 'warp' or 'reese' speed garage basslines, or the [[Korg M1]] style organ lead. This led to many releases having a 'warper' mix along with an 'organ' mix of the same track. Like most electronic music, sampling played a big part, as lots of the same sampled basslines can be heard in old speed garage and bassline house releases.\n\nTowards the end of the 2000s, a new wave of younger producers such as TS7, Service Crew, Danny bond and others coupled with the rise of [[Digital audio workstations]], which reduced the use of drum machine samples and old sampled basslines, took bassline to a different path. This style started to be called '4x4', moving further away from the original speed garage sound, but still retaining the core elements such as the warping basslines and female vocals. In general, bassline as a whole remained fairly underground and was mostly only popular in the North and Midlands, and releases often never went beyond a 12\" vinyl EP, or featuring on obscure CD mixes or compilations.

The text of the hymn is a paraphrase of [[Psalm 137]]. Its singing tune, which is the best known part of the hymn and Dachstein's best known melody, was popularised as [[chorale]] tune of [[Paul Gerhardt]]'s 17th-century [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]] hymn \"[[Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld]]\". With this hymn text, Dachstein's tune is included in the Protestant hymnal ''[[Evangelisches Gesangbuch]]''.\n\nSeveral vocal and [[pipe organ|organ]] settings of the hymn \"An Wasserfl\u00fcssen Babylon\" have been composed in the 17th and 18th century, including 4-part harmonisations by [[Johann Hermann Schein]], [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]] and [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. In the second half of the 17th century, [[Johann Pachelbel]], [[Johann Adam Reincken]] and Bach's [[First Cousin Once Removed|cousin]], [[Johann Christoph Bach|Johann Christoph]], arranged settings for [[chorale prelude]]s.\n\nThe arrangements of \"An Wasserfl\u00fcssen Babylon\" by Reincken and Pachelbel form the earliest extant transcriptions of Bach, copied on a 1700 [[organ tablature]] in [[L\u00fcneburg]] when he was still a youth; remarkably, they were only unearthed in [[Weimar]] in 2005.\n\nIn 1720, in a celebrated organ concert at [[St. Catherine's Church, Hamburg|Hamburg]], Bach extemporised a chorale setting of \"An Wasserfl\u00fcssen Babylon\" in the presence of Reincken, two years before his death. Bach also composed three versions of the chorale prelude \"An Wasserfl\u00fcssen Babylon\" as part of the ''[[Great Eighteen Chorale Preludes]]'', the last dating from 1740\u20131750 in [[Leipzig]], possibly as a tribute to Reincken's well-known chorale fantasia.\n\n== History and context ==\n[[File:Nuremberg-Chronicles-1493-Strasburg-Argentina.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Woodcut of [[Strasbourg]] from ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'', [[Hartmann Schedel]], 1493: [[Strasbourg Cathedral|Cathedral]]&nbsp;(r) and [[St Thomas' Church, Strasbourg|St Thomas]]&nbsp;(l)]]\n\n[[File:Stra\u00dfburger-Gesangbuch-1541.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.1|Title page of the 1541 ''Stra\u00dfburger Gesangbuch'']]\n[[File:Martin Bucer by Boissard.png|thumb|Martin Bucer, \"Icones quinquaginta vivorum\": engraving by [[Jean-Jacques Boissard]]]]\n\n\"An Wasserfl\u00fcssen Babylon\" is a Lutheran hymn written in 1525 and attributed to [[Wolfgang Dachstein]], organist at [[St Thomas' Church, Strasbourg]].<ref name=\"Leahy\">{{harvnb|Leahy|2011|pages=37\u201338, 53}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Terry|1921|pages=101\u2013103}}</ref><ref name=\"Julian 1907\">{{harvnb|Julian|1907}}</ref> The hymn is a closely paraphrased versification of [[Psalm 137]], \"By the rivers of Babylon\", a lamentation for Jerusalem, exiled in Babylon.<ref name=\"Leahy\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Stinson|2001|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=1uCUsdmP7Z4C&pg=PA78 78]}}</ref> Its text and melody, [[Zahn number]] 7663, first appeared in [[Strasbourg]] in 1525 in [[Wolf K\u00f6pphel]]'s ''Das dritt theil Stra\u00dfburger kirchenampt''.<ref name=\"Leahy\"/><ref name=\"Zahn1891\">{{harvnb|Zahn|1891}}</ref> This Strasbourg tract, which comprised the third part of the Lutheran service, is now lost.<ref name=\"Zahn1891\" /> Despite the lost tract from 1525, the Strasbourg hymn appeared in print in 1526 in ''Psalmen, Gebett und Kirchenordnung wie sie zu Stra\u00dfburg gehalten werden'' and later.<ref name=\"Zahn1891\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Zahn|1893|page=[https://archive.org/stream/1508288358bsb11304504#page/n15/mode/2up 7]}}</ref><ref name=\"Trocm\u00e9-Latter2015pp255-265\">{{harvnb|Trocm\u00e9-Latter|2015|pages=255\u2013265}}</ref>\n\nWolfgang Egeloph Dachstein was born in 1487 in [[Offenburg]] in the [[Black Forest]].

Greiter was born in 1495 in [[Aichach]], near [[Augsburg]] in [[Bavaria]], where he attended a Latin school, before enrolling in [[theology]] at the [[University of Freiburg]] in 1510 and becoming a monk in Strasbourg in 1520.<ref>{{harvnb|Weber|2001|pages=70\u201371}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Brusniak|2001|pages=121\u2013122}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Forna\u00e7on, Siegfried|1957|page=465}}</ref><ref> {{harvnb|M\u00fcller, Hans-Christian|1966|pages=41\u201342}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Trocm\u00e9-Latter|2015|pages=28\u201332, 90\u201396, 201}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Reformation]], Protestantism was adopted in Strasbourg in 1524. The reforms involved the introduction of the German vernacular, the use of [[Agenda (liturgy)|Lutheran liturgy]] (\"Gottesdienstordnung\") and congregational singing. Both Greiter and Dachstein renounced their monastic vows and married in Alsace. Their association continued, with Greiter becoming a cantor in the Cathedral and Dachstein an organist at St Thomas. Both played an important role in the musical life of Strasbourg, with many contributions to Lutheran hymns and psalms.

The text of the hymn is a paraphrase of [[Psalm 137]]. Its singing tune, which is the best known part of the hymn and Dachstein's best known melody, was popularised as [[chorale]] tune of [[Paul Gerhardt]]'s 17th-century [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]] hymn \"[[Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld]]\". With this hymn text, Dachstein's tune is included in the Protestant hymnal ''[[Evangelisches Gesangbuch]]''.\n\nSeveral vocal and [[pipe organ|organ]] settings of the hymn \"An Wasserfl\u00fcssen Babylon\" have been composed in the 17th and 18th century, including 4-part harmonisations by [[Johann Hermann Schein]], [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]] and [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. In the second half of the 17th century, [[Johann Pachelbel]], [[Johann Adam Reincken]] and Bach's [[First Cousin Once Removed|cousin]], [[Johann Christoph Bach|Johann Christoph]], arranged settings for [[chorale prelude]]s.\n\nThe arrangements of \"An Wasserfl\u00fcssen Babylon\" by Reincken and Pachelbel form the earliest extant transcriptions of Bach, copied on a 1700 [[organ tablature]] in [[L\u00fcneburg]] when he was still a youth; remarkably, they were only unearthed in [[Weimar]] in 2005.\n\nIn 1720, in a celebrated organ concert at [[St. Catherine's Church, Hamburg|Hamburg]], Bach extemporised a chorale setting of \"An Wasserfl\u00fcssen Babylon\" in the presence of Reincken, two years before his death. Bach also composed three versions of the chorale prelude \"An Wasserfl\u00fcssen Babylon\" as part of the ''[[Great Eighteen Chorale Preludes]]'', the last dating from 1740\u20131750 in [[Leipzig]], possibly as a tribute to Reincken's well-known chorale fantasia.\n\n== History and context ==\n[[File:Nuremberg-Chronicles-1493-Strasburg-Argentina.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Woodcut of [[Strasbourg]] from ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'', [[Hartmann Schedel]], 1493: [[Strasbourg Cathedral|Cathedral]]&nbsp;(r) and [[St Thomas' Church, Strasbourg|St Thomas]]&nbsp;(l)]]\n\n[[File:Stra\u00dfburger-Gesangbuch-1541.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.1|Title page of the 1541 ''Stra\u00dfburger Gesangbuch'']]\n[[File:Martin Bucer by Boissard.png|thumb|Martin Bucer, \"Icones quinquaginta vivorum\": engraving by [[Jean-Jacques Boissard]]]]\n\n\"An Wasserfl\u00fcssen Babylon\" is a Lutheran hymn written in 1525 and attributed to [[Wolfgang Dachstein]], organist at [[St Thomas' Church, Strasbourg]].<ref name=\"Leahy\">{{harvnb|Leahy|2011|pages=37\u201338, 53}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Terry|1921|pages=101\u2013103}}</ref><ref name=\"Julian 1907\">{{harvnb|Julian|1907}}</ref> The hymn is a closely paraphrased versification of [[Psalm 137]], \"By the rivers of Babylon\", a lamentation for Jerusalem, exiled in Babylon.<ref name=\"Leahy\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Stinson|2001|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=1uCUsdmP7Z4C&pg=PA78 78]}}</ref> Its text and melody, [[Zahn number]] 7663, first appeared in [[Strasbourg]] in 1525 in [[Wolf K\u00f6pphel]]'s ''Das dritt theil Stra\u00dfburger kirchenampt''.<ref name=\"Leahy\"/><ref name=\"Zahn1891\">{{harvnb|Zahn|1891}}</ref> This Strasbourg tract, which comprised the third part of the Lutheran service, is now lost.<ref name=\"Zahn1891\" /> Despite the lost tract from 1525, the Strasbourg hymn appeared in print in 1526 in ''Psalmen, Gebett und Kirchenordnung wie sie zu Stra\u00dfburg gehalten werden'' and later.<ref name=\"Zahn1891\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Zahn|1893|page=[https://archive.org/stream/1508288358bsb11304504#page/n15/mode/2up 7]}}</ref><ref name=\"Trocm\u00e9-Latter2015pp255-265\">{{harvnb|Trocm\u00e9-Latter|2015|pages=255\u2013265}}</ref>\n\nWolfgang Egeloph Dachstein was born in 1487 in [[Offenburg]] in the [[Black Forest]]. In 1503 he became a fellow student with [[Martin Luther]] at the [[University of Erfurt]]. He entered the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] monastic order in around 1520 in Strasbourg, where he started a collaboration with [[Matthias Greitter|Matthias Greiter]], a friend and contemporary. Greiter was born in 1495 in [[Aichach]], near [[Augsburg]] in [[Bavaria]], where he attended a Latin school, before enrolling in [[theology]] at the [[University of Freiburg]] in 1510 and becoming a monk in Strasbourg in 1520.<ref>{{harvnb|Weber|2001|pages=70\u201371}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Brusniak|2001|pages=121\u2013122}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Forna\u00e7on, Siegfried|1957|page=465}}</ref><ref> {{harvnb|M\u00fcller, Hans-Christian|1966|pages=41\u201342}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Trocm\u00e9-Latter|2015|pages=28\u201332, 90\u201396, 201}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Reformation]], Protestantism was adopted in Strasbourg in 1524. The reforms involved the introduction of the German vernacular, the use of [[Agenda (liturgy)|Lutheran liturgy]] (\"Gottesdienstordnung\") and congregational singing. Both Greiter and Dachstein renounced their monastic vows and married in Alsace. Their association continued, with Greiter becoming a cantor in the Cathedral and Dachstein an organist at St Thomas. Both played an important role in the musical life of Strasbourg, with many contributions to Lutheran hymns and psalms. [[Daniel Specklin]], a 16th-century architect from [[Alsace]], where the region [[Dachstein, Bas-Rhin|Dachstein]] takes its name, described in detail how the pair engaged in \"das evangelium\" and \"vil gute psalmen\". A costly edition of the ''Stra\u00dfburger Gesangbuch'' was published by K\u00f6pphel in 1541, with a preface by the Lutheran reformer [[Martin Bucer]]: the title, text and psalm were printed in characteristic red and black with woodcuts by [[Hans Baldung]]. During the [[Counter-Reformation]], however, the [[Augsburg Interim]] resulted in Strasbourg reinstating Catholicism in October 1549: both Dachstein and Greiter renounced Protestantism and Bucer was sent into exile in [[England]], where under [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] he became [[Regius Professor of Divinity#Professors at Cambridge|Regius Professor of Divinity]].<ref name=\"DachGreit-FlB\"> See:\n*{{harvnb|Weber|2001|pages=70\u201371}}\n*{{harvnb|Brusniak|2001|pages=121\u2013122}}\n*{{harvnb|Forna\u00e7on, Siegfried|1957|page=465}}\n*{{harvnb|M\u00fcller, Hans-Christian|1966|pages=41\u201342}}\n*{{harvnb|Trocm\u00e9-Latter|2015|pages=28\u201332, 90\u201396, 201}}</ref><!--<ref name=\"Grove-FlB\"> See also:\n*{{harvnb|M\u00fcller|Migliorini|2001}}\n*{{harvnb|M\u00fcller|Davies|2001}}</ref> --><ref>{{harvnb|Trocm\u00e9-Latter|2015|pages=233\u2013234}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hopf|1946|pages=1\u201316}}</ref>\n\nDachstein's hymn \"An Wasserfl\u00fcssen Babylon\" was rapidly distributed\u2014it was printed in Luther's 1545 ''Babstsches Gesangbuch''<ref>{{harvnb|Krummacher|2001|pages=194\u2013195}}</ref>\u2014and spread to most Lutheran hymnbooks by central Germany.<ref name=\"Leahy\"/> After the [[Sack of Magdeburg]] in 1631, during the [[Thirty Years' War]], it was decreed that Dachstein's 137th Psalm would be sung every year as part of the ceremonies to commemorate the destruction of [[Magdeburg]].<ref name=\"Werner2016p205\">{{harvnb|Werner|2016|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=adxtDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA205 205]}}</ref>\n\nThe melody of the hymn became better known than its text, through the association of that melody with [[Paul Gerhardt]]'s 17th-century [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]] hymn \"[[Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld]]\".<ref name=\"Zahn1891\" /><ref name=\"Werner2016p205\" /> With that hymn text, the hymn tune of \"An Wasserfl\u00fcssen Babylon\" is adopted as EG&nbsp;83 in the Protestant hymnal ''[[Evangelisches Gesangbuch]]''.<ref name=\"Axmacher\" /><ref name=\"W\u00fcrttemberg\" /> The hymn tune is Dachstein's best known composition.<ref name=\"Julian 1907\" />\n\n[[Miles Coverdale]] provided an early English translation in the Tudor Protestant Hymnal ''\"Ghostly Psalms and Spiritual Songs,\"'' 1539.

Fletcher agrees and discovers that Warren's wife is questioning their marriage. That evening, he composes a response to the letter for Warren to send, and offers a similar service to other prisoners with wives - in the case of Lukewarm, his [[homosexual]] partner - when he speaks to Warren about what he wrote, in exchange for payment in [[tobacco]]. A few days later, Warren brings another letter from his wife for Fletcher to read, and learns that he has nothing to worry. He thus becomes excited to see her in the upcoming visiting day, alongside the others whom Fletcher has been helping.\n\nOn visiting day, Fletcher is reunited with his daughter Ingrid, instead of his wife, and learns from her that she has met a new man. Learning of this, the prison governor decides for Fletcher to receive compassionate parole for the weekend, in order to sort out his marital problems. Returning home to [[London]], Fletcher is accompanied by an officer from the local station to ensure no domestic incidents occur, whereupon he celebrates seeing his wife and family after the officer leaves. Fletcher admits that he enjoys them tricking the prison service into giving him a few days out of prison on the grounds of martial issues, in order to savor some of the nicer things one can have on the weekend.\n\nFletcher swiftly spends his time wisely, watching a [[association football|football]] match, visiting the local [[pub]], and having a proper Sunday dinner. However, with his time at home nearly up, Fletcher vows to his wife that his current prison sentence will be the last, as he feels like a father figure amongst the other prisoners at his age. Upon returning to Slade Prison that Sunday evening, Fletcher learns that the prisoners he helped have had issues, as their loved ones discovered that the received the same kind of letter, to which Fletcher taunts them to the fact he had spent an enjoyable weekend with his wife. As he relaxes in his cell, Mackay assumes that he has had a change in his attitude since returning when conversing with Barrowclough, only to see him reading a paper in his cell, before removing it from his hand to display a [[V-sign]] to Mackay.\n\n==Episode cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Then, for the patient to exhale, the air inside the cylinder is compressed slightly (or allowed to equalize to ambient room pressure), causing the patient's chest and abdomen to partially collapse, forcing air out of the lungs, as the patient exhales the breath through their exposed mouth and nose, outside the cylinder.<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /><ref name=\"what_is_the_background_2019_04_11medscape\" /><ref name=\"the_iron_lung_sciencemuseum_org_uk\" /><ref name=\"how_does_iron_lung_work_2018_08_21_newsweek\" />\n\nExamples of the device include the Drinker respirator, the Emerson respirator, and the Both respirator.

The Cuirass ventilator encloses only the patient's torso, or chest and abdomen, but otherwise operates essentially the same as the original, full-sized iron lung. A modern version is the ''exovent.''   A lightweight variation on the cuirass ventilator is the ''jacket ventilator'' or ''poncho'' or ''raincoat''  ventilator, which uses a flexible, impermeable material (such as plastic or rubber) stretched over a metal or plastic frame over the patient's torso.<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"modern_iron_lung_2020_04_06_newatlas\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_and_2020_04_11_oxy_gen\">[http://oxygen.milano.it/en/the-iron-lung-and-the-modern-ventilation/ \"The 'iron lung' and the modern 'ventilation',\"] Oxy.gen, \nretrieved April 11, 2020 (caution: source unclear; apparently an Italian oxygen-supplier)</ref><ref name=\"poncho_dima_italia_sri\">[https://www.dimaitalia.com/en/tag/poncho/ \"Poncho,\"] by medical device manufacturer [[Dima Italia Srl]] of [[Bologna, Italy]] (picture of jacket ventilator (\"poncho\"), and other information.), retrieved April 12, 2020</ref>\n\n==Method and use==\n===normal breathing===\n:[[breathing|Main section: breathing]]\nHumans, like most mammals, breathe by ''negative pressure'' breathing:<ref name=stemnet>{{cite web|title=Gas Exchange in Humans|url=http://www.stemnet.nf.ca/~dpower/resp/exchange.htm|accessdate=2011-07-01|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423113840/http://www.stemnet.nf.ca/~dpower/resp/exchange.htm|archivedate=2009-04-23}}</ref> the rib cage expands and the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] contracts, expanding the [[chest cavity]]. This causes the pressure in the chest cavity to decrease, and the [[lung]]s expand to fill the space. This, in turn, causes the pressure of the air inside the lungs to decrease (it becomes negative, relative to the atmosphere), and air flows from the atmosphere, through the patient's [[airway]], into their lungs: [[inhalation]]. When the diaphragm relaxes, the reverse happens and the person [[exhalation|exhales]]. If a person loses part or all of the ability to control the muscles involved, breathing becomes difficult or impossible.\n\n===breathing with iron lung===\nThe iron lung encloses the patient entirely, except for their head -- which includes their main airway orfices: nose and mouth, which remain exposed to outside (\"ambient\") air. A pump (typically a mechanically-powered diaphragm) momentarily reduces the air pressure inside the iron lung, to a pressure lower than outside (ambient) air.<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /><ref name=\"what_is_the_background_2019_04_11medscape\" /><ref name=\"initiating_1988_3_intensive_care_med\" /><ref name=\"the_iron_lung_sciencemuseum_org_uk\" />\n\nThis causes the air within the iron lung, but outside the chest wall, to be at a lower pressure than the air inside the patient's lungs (thus, the term \"negative pressure\"), so the patient's lungs and chest expand to equalize their air pressure to the lower pressure of the interior of the iron lung.<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /><ref name=\"what_is_the_background_2019_04_11medscape\" /><ref name=\"initiating_1988_3_intensive_care_med\" /><ref name=\"the_iron_lung_sciencemuseum_org_uk\" />\n\nNow, the expanded lungs are at a lower pressure than the \"ambient\" air outside the iron lung.  As a result, outside (ambient) air forces its way in through the patient's exposed nose and mouth, into their airway, to fill the lower-pressure space inside the patient's lungs -- and the patient has thus \"taken a breath\" (\"inhaled\").<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /><ref name=\"what_is_the_background_2019_04_11medscape\" /><ref name=\"initiating_1988_3_intensive_care_med\" /><ref name=\"the_iron_lung_sciencemuseum_org_uk\" />\n\nExhaling is stimulated by allowing the pressure inside the iron lung to return to normal, matching the outside (ambient) air pressure.  As a result, the patient's chest is no longer being expanded by negative pressure, and the natural elasticity of the patient's chest causes it to collapse, squeezing air pro the patient's lungs, through the patient's airway, and out of their exposed mouth and nose -- and the patient has thus \"exhaled.\"<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /><ref name=\"what_is_the_background_2019_04_11medscape\" /><ref name=\"initiating_1988_3_intensive_care_med\" /><ref name=\"the_iron_lung_sciencemuseum_org_uk\" />\n\nThe process continues cycling, repetitively, at a rate set by the person operating the iron lung's controls, to maintain continuous patient artificial respiration (artificial \"breathing\").<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /><ref name=\"what_is_the_background_2019_04_11medscape\" /><ref name=\"initiating_1988_3_intensive_care_med\" /><ref name=\"the_iron_lung_sciencemuseum_org_uk\" />\n\nThe iron lung may assist normal patient respiration, or it may completely substitute for it, depending upon the patient's condition.

Emerson won the case, and Drinker's patents were declared invalid.\n\nThe United Kingdom's first iron lung was designed in 1934 by Robert Henderson, an Aberdeen doctor. Henderson had seen a demonstration of the Drinker respirator in the early 1930s, and built a device of his own upon his return to Scotland. Four weeks after its construction, the Henderson respirator was used to save the life of a 10-year-old boy from New Deer, Aberdeenshire, who was suffering from poliomyelitis.

Although the Drinker model was effective and saved lives, its widespread use was hindered by the fact that the machines were very large, heavy (about 750 lbs), bulky, and expensive. In the US, an adult machine cost about $2000 in 1930, and \u00a32000 delivered to Melbourne in 1936. The cost in Europe in the mid-1950s was around \u00a31500.

Most patients with paralysis of the breathing muscles use modern [[mechanical ventilation|mechanical ventilators]] that push air into the airway with positive pressure.

This causes the pressure in the chest cavity to decrease, and the [[lung]]s expand to fill the space. This, in turn, causes the pressure of the air inside the lungs to decrease (it becomes negative, relative to the atmosphere), and air flows from the atmosphere, through the patient's [[airway]], into their lungs: [[inhalation]]. When the diaphragm relaxes, the reverse happens and the person [[exhalation|exhales]]. If a person loses part or all of the ability to control the muscles involved, breathing becomes difficult or impossible.\n\n===breathing with iron lung===\nThe iron lung encloses the patient entirely, except for their head -- which includes their main airway orfices: nose and mouth, which remain exposed to outside (\"ambient\") air. A pump (typically a mechanically-powered diaphragm) momentarily reduces the air pressure inside the iron lung, to a pressure lower than outside (ambient) air.<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /><ref name=\"what_is_the_background_2019_04_11medscape\" /><ref name=\"initiating_1988_3_intensive_care_med\" /><ref name=\"the_iron_lung_sciencemuseum_org_uk\" />\n\nThis causes the air within the iron lung, but outside the chest wall, to be at a lower pressure than the air inside the patient's lungs (thus, the term \"negative pressure\"), so the patient's lungs and chest expand to equalize their air pressure to the lower pressure of the interior of the iron lung.<ref name=\"non_invasive_domiciliary_ventilation_sheerson\" /><ref name=\"iron_lung_2016_01_11_openpediatrics_you_tube\" /><ref name=\"what_is_the_background_2019_04_11medscape\" /><ref name=\"initiating_1988_3_intensive_care_med\" /><ref name=\"the_iron_lung_sciencemuseum_org_uk\" />\n\nNow, the expanded lungs are at a lower pressure than the \"ambient\" air outside the iron lung.

She was targeted by many Japanese bombers as she got under way and sustained more hits from {{convert|250|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}} bombs, which started further fires. She was deliberately beached to avoid blocking the harbor entrance. {{USS|California|BB-44|2}} was hit by two bombs and two torpedoes. The crew might have kept her afloat, but were ordered to abandon ship just as they were raising power for the pumps. Burning oil from ''Arizona'' and {{USS|West Virginia|BB-48|2}} drifted down on her, and probably made the situation look worse than it was. The disarmed [[target ship]] {{USS|Utah|BB-31|2}} was holed twice by torpedoes. ''West Virginia'' was hit by seven torpedoes, the seventh tearing away her rudder. {{USS|Oklahoma|BB-37|2}} was hit by four torpedoes, the last two above her [[belt armor]], which caused her to capsize. {{USS|Maryland|BB-46|2}} was hit by two of the converted 16\" shells, but neither caused serious damage.\n\nAlthough the Japanese concentrated on battleships (the largest vessels present), they did not ignore other targets. The light cruiser {{USS|Helena|CL-50|2}} was torpedoed, and the concussion from the blast capsized the neighboring minelayer {{USS|Oglala|CM-4|2}}. Two destroyers in [[dry dock]], {{USS|Cassin|DD-372|2}} and {{USS|Downes|DD-375|2}} were destroyed when bombs penetrated their fuel [[Bunker fuel|bunkers]]. The leaking fuel caught fire; flooding the dry dock in an effort to fight fire made the burning oil rise, and both were burned out. ''Cassin'' slipped from her keel blocks and rolled against ''Downes''. The light cruiser {{USS|Raleigh|CL-7|2}} was holed by a torpedo. The light cruiser {{USS|Honolulu|CL-48|2}} was damaged, but remained in service. The repair vessel {{USS|Vestal|AR-4|2}}, moored alongside ''Arizona'', was heavily damaged and beached.

The island of [[Niihau]], only 30 minutes flying time from Pearl Harbor, was designated as the rescue point.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe Zero flown by Petty Officer Shigenori Nishikaichi of ''Hiryu'' was damaged in the attack on Wheeler, so he flew to the rescue point. The aircraft was further damaged on landing. Nishikaichi was helped from the wreckage by one of the native Hawaiians, who, aware of the tension between the United States and Japan, took the pilot's pistol, maps, codes, and other documents. The island's residents had no telephones or radios and were completely unaware of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Nishikaichi enlisted the support of three Japanese-American residents in an attempt to recover the documents. During the ensuing struggles, Nishikaichi was killed and a Hawaiian civilian was wounded; one collaborator committed suicide, and his wife and the third collaborator were sent to prison.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe ease with which the local ethnic Japanese residents had apparently gone to Nishikaichi's assistance was a source of concern for many, and tended to support those who believed that local Japanese could not be trusted.<ref>Douglas Shinsato, Translator/Publisher of For That One Day: The Memoirs of Mitsuo Fuchida, Commander of the Attack on Pearl Harbor, 2011, pp.&nbsp;293\u2013294</ref>\n\n===Strategic implications===\nAdmiral [[Ch\u016bichi Hara|Hara Tadaichi]] summed up the Japanese result by saying, \"We won a great tactical victory at Pearl Harbor and thereby lost the war.\"<ref>Haufler, Herve. ''Codebreaker's Victory: How the Allied Cryptographers Won World War II'' (New York: NAL, 2003), quoted p. 127.</ref>\n\nWhile the attack accomplished its intended objective, it turned out to be largely unnecessary. Unbeknownst to Yamamoto, who conceived the original plan, the U.S. Navy had decided as far back as 1935 to abandon 'charging' across the Pacific towards the Philippines in response to an outbreak of war (in keeping with the evolution of [[War Plan Orange|Plan Orange]]).<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{Harvnb|Peattie|1997}}</ref> The U.S. instead adopted \"[[Plan Dog]]\" in 1940, which emphasized keeping the IJN out of the eastern Pacific and away from the shipping lanes to Australia, while the U.S. concentrated on defeating Nazi Germany.<ref>{{harvnb|Hakim|1995}}</ref>\n\nFortunately for the United States, the American aircraft carriers were untouched; otherwise the Pacific Fleet's ability to conduct offensive operations would have been crippled for a year or more (given no diversions from the Atlantic Fleet). As it was, the elimination of the battleships left the U.S. Navy with no choice but to rely on its aircraft carriers and submarines\u2014the very weapons with which the U.S. Navy halted and eventually reversed the Japanese advance. While six of the eight battleships were repaired and returned to service, their relatively low speed and high fuel consumption limited their deployment, and they served mainly in shore bombardment roles (their only major action being the [[Battle of Surigao Strait]] in October 1944). A major flaw of Japanese strategic thinking was a belief that the ultimate Pacific battle would be fought by battleships, in keeping with the doctrine of Captain [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]]. As a result, Yamamoto (and his successors) hoarded battleships for a \"decisive battle\" that never happened.<ref>{{Harvnb|Willmott|1983}}, ''War Plan Orange''{{clarify|date=October 2011|reason=need full cite.

As early as 1924, Chief of U.S. Air Service [[Mason Patrick]] displayed a concern for military vulnerabilities in the Pacific, having sent Gen. [[Billy Mitchell]] on a survey of the Pacific and the East.

The Canadian province of [[British Columbia]], bordering the Pacific Ocean, had long had a large population of Japanese immigrants and their [[Japanese Canadian|Japanese-Canadian]] descendants.

On February 24, 1942, Order-in-Council P.C. no. 1486 was passed under the [[War Measures Act]], allowing for the forced removal of any and all Canadians of Japanese descent from British Columbia, as well as the prohibiting them from returning to the province.

The island's residents had no telephones or radios and were completely unaware of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Nishikaichi enlisted the support of three Japanese-American residents in an attempt to recover the documents. During the ensuing struggles, Nishikaichi was killed and a Hawaiian civilian was wounded; one collaborator committed suicide, and his wife and the third collaborator were sent to prison.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe ease with which the local ethnic Japanese residents had apparently gone to Nishikaichi's assistance was a source of concern for many, and tended to support those who believed that local Japanese could not be trusted.<ref>Douglas Shinsato, Translator/Publisher of For That One Day: The Memoirs of Mitsuo Fuchida, Commander of the Attack on Pearl Harbor, 2011, pp.&nbsp;293\u2013294</ref>\n\n===Strategic implications===\nAdmiral [[Ch\u016bichi Hara|Hara Tadaichi]] summed up the Japanese result by saying, \"We won a great tactical victory at Pearl Harbor and thereby lost the war.\"<ref>Haufler, Herve.

Unbeknownst to Yamamoto, who conceived the original plan, the U.S. Navy had decided as far back as 1935 to abandon 'charging' across the Pacific towards the Philippines in response to an outbreak of war (in keeping with the evolution of [[War Plan Orange|Plan Orange]]).<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{Harvnb|Peattie|1997}}</ref> The U.S. instead adopted \"[[Plan Dog]]\" in 1940, which emphasized keeping the IJN out of the eastern Pacific and away from the shipping lanes to Australia, while the U.S. concentrated on defeating Nazi Germany.<ref>{{harvnb|Hakim|1995}}</ref>\n\nFortunately for the United States, the American aircraft carriers were untouched; otherwise the Pacific Fleet's ability to conduct offensive operations would have been crippled for a year or more (given no diversions from the Atlantic Fleet). As it was, the elimination of the battleships left the U.S. Navy with no choice but to rely on its aircraft carriers and submarines\u2014the very weapons with which the U.S. Navy halted and eventually reversed the Japanese advance. While six of the eight battleships were repaired and returned to service, their relatively low speed and high fuel consumption limited their deployment, and they served mainly in shore bombardment roles (their only major action being the [[Battle of Surigao Strait]] in October 1944). A major flaw of Japanese strategic thinking was a belief that the ultimate Pacific battle would be fought by battleships, in keeping with the doctrine of Captain [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]]. As a result, Yamamoto (and his successors) hoarded battleships for a \"decisive battle\" that never happened.<ref>{{Harvnb|Willmott|1983}}, ''War Plan Orange''{{clarify|date=October 2011|reason=need full cite.

As early as 1924, Chief of U.S. Air Service [[Mason Patrick]] displayed a concern for military vulnerabilities in the Pacific, having sent Gen. [[Billy Mitchell]] on a survey of the Pacific and the East.
