It was held from Wednesday, November 1, to Wednesday, December 6, 1820. Taking place at the height of the [[Era of Good Feelings]], the election saw incumbent [[Democratic-Republican]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[James Monroe]] win re-election without a major opponent. It was the [[List of United States presidential elections by Electoral College margin|third]] and last United States presidential election in which a presidential candidate ran effectively unopposed. It was also the last election of a president from the Revolutionary generation.\n\nMonroe and Vice President [[Daniel D. Tompkins]] faced no opposition from other Democratic-Republicans in their quest for a second term. The Federalist Party had fielded a presidential candidate in each election since [[1796 United States presidential election|1796]], but the party's already-waning popularity had declined further following the [[War of 1812]]. Although able to field [[Richard Stockton (U.S. Senator)|a nominee for vice president]], the Federalists could not put forward a presidential candidate, leaving Monroe without organized opposition.\n\nMonroe won every state and received all but one of the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]]. Secretary of State [[John Quincy Adams]] received the only other electoral vote, which came from [[faithless elector]] [[William Plumer]]. Four different Federalists received electoral votes for vice president, but Tompkins won re-election by a large margin. No other post-[[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] presidential candidate has matched Monroe's share of the electoral vote, and Monroe and [[George Washington]] remain the only presidential candidates to run without any major opposition. Monroe's victory was the last of six straight victories by Virginians in presidential elections (Jefferson twice, Madison twice, and Monroe twice).\n\n== Background ==\nDespite the continuation of single party politics (known in this case as the [[Era of Good Feelings]]), serious issues emerged during the election in 1820. The nation had endured a widespread depression following the [[Panic of 1819]] and momentous disagreement about the extension of slavery into the territories was taking center stage. Nevertheless, James Monroe faced no opposition party or candidate in his re-election bid, although he did not receive  all of the electoral votes (see below).\n\nMassachusetts was entitled to 22 electoral votes in 1816, but cast only 15 in 1820 by reason of the [[Missouri Compromise]] of 1820, which made the region of [[Maine]], long part of Massachusetts, a free state to balance the pending admission of slave state Missouri. In addition, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Mississippi also cast one fewer electoral vote than they were entitled to, as one elector from each state died before the electoral meeting. Consequently, this meant that Mississippi cast only two votes, when any state is always entitled to a minimum of three; this is the only time this has happened.\n\nMississippi, Illinois, Alabama and Missouri participated in their first presidential election in 1820, Missouri with controversy, since it was not yet officially a state (see below). No new states would participate in American presidential elections until 1836, after the admission to the Union of Arkansas in 1836 and Michigan in 1837 (after the main voting, but before the counting of the electoral vote in Congress).<ref>[http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h261.html Election of 1820]</ref>\n\n== Nominations ==\n=== Democratic-Republican Party nomination ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|[[File:Tricolour Cockade.svg|65px|center|link=Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican Party]]<big>'''Democratic-Republican Party Ticket, 1820'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#228B22; width:200px;\"| [[James Monroe|{{color|white|James Monroe}}]]\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#228B22; width:200px;\"| [[Daniel D.

Only 40 delegates attended, with few or no delegates from the large states of Virginia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Massachusetts, and New Jersey. Rather than name the president with only a handful of votes, the caucus declined to make a formal nomination. [[Richard Mentor Johnson|Richard M. Johnson]] offered the following resolution: \"It is inexpedient, at this time, to proceed to the nomination of persons for the offices of President and Vice President of the United States.\" After debate, the resolution was unanimously adopted, and the meeting adjourned. President Monroe and Vice President Daniel D. Tompkins thus became de ''facto'' candidates for re-election.\n\nIn the run-up to the caucus, Tompkins made another run for his former post of [[Governor of New York]], leading to potential replacements being informally discussed among the party leadership. The matter was ultimately rendered moot when Tompkins lost the [[1820 New York gubernatorial election|election]] shortly before the nominating caucus took place, and though some within the party remained dissatisfied with Tompkins' performance as Vice President, the role was not considered important enough to be worth a formal nomination process after his ability to continue in the office was confirmed.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|+Informal Ballot\n|-\n!Presidential Ballot!! !!Vice Presidential Ballot!!\n|-\n![[James Monroe]] !!40!!

This law stated that \"the said state, when formed, shall be admitted into the Union, upon an equal footing with the original states, in all respects whatsoever.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=United States Congress |others=Act of March 6, ch. 23, vol. 3 |title=United States Statutes at Large |url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(sj06845)) |accessdate=August 9, 2006 |year=1820 |pages=545\u2013548}}</ref> However, when Congress reconvened in November 1820, the admission of Missouri became an issue of contention. Proponents claimed that Missouri had fulfilled the conditions of the law and therefore was a state; detractors contended that certain provisions of the Missouri Constitution violated the United States Constitution.\n\nBy the time Congress was due to meet to count the electoral votes from the election, this dispute had lasted over two months. The counting raised a ticklish problem: if Congress counted Missouri's votes, that would count as recognition that Missouri was a state; on the other hand, if Congress failed to count Missouri's vote, it would count as recognition that Missouri was not a state. Knowing ahead of time that Monroe had won in a landslide and that Missouri's vote would therefore make no difference in the final result, the Senate passed a resolution on February 13, 1821 stating that if a protest were made, there would be no consideration of the matter unless the vote of Missouri would change who would become president. Instead, the President of the Senate would announce the final tally twice, once with Missouri included and once with it excluded.<ref>{{cite book |author=United States Congress |others=16th Congress, 2nd Session, February 13 |title=Senate Journal |url=http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(sj01070)) |accessdate=July 29, 2006 |year=1821 |pages=187\u2013188}}</ref>\n\nThe next day this resolution was introduced in the full House. After a lively debate, it was passed. Nonetheless, during the counting of the electoral votes on February 14, 1821, an objection was raised to the votes from Missouri by Representative [[Arthur Livermore]] of New Hampshire. He argued that since Missouri had not yet officially become a state, it had no right to cast any electoral votes. Immediately, Representative [[John Floyd (Virginia politician)|John Floyd]] of Virginia argued that Missouri's votes must be counted. Chaos ensued, and order was restored only with the counting of the vote as per the resolution and then adjournment for the day.<ref>{{cite book |publisher=Gales and Seaton |others=16th Congress, 2nd Session, February 14, 1821 |title=Annals of Congress |url=http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(sj01070)) |accessdate=July 29, 2006 |year=1856 |pages=1147\u20131165}}</ref>\n\n==Results==\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1820-Large.png|thumb|500px]]\n\n===Popular vote===\nThe Federalists received a small amount of the popular vote despite having no electoral candidates.

Plumer cast his electoral ballot for [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] John Quincy Adams. While legend has it this was to ensure that George Washington would remain the only American president unanimously chosen by the Electoral College, that was not Plumer's goal. In fact, Plumer simply thought that Monroe was a mediocre president and that Adams would be a better one.<ref>Turner (1955) p 253</ref> Plumer also refused to vote for Tompkins for Vice President as \"grossly intemperate\", not having \"that weight of character which his office requires,\" and \"because he grossly neglected his duty\" in his \"only\" official role as President of the Senate by being \"absent nearly three-fourths of the time\";<ref>[https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_Daniel_Tompkins.htm \"Daniel D. Tompkins, 6th Vice President (1817-1825)\"] United States Senate web site.</ref> Plumer instead voted for [[Richard Rush]].\n\nEven though every member of the Electoral College was pledged to Monroe, there were still a number of Federalist electors who voted for a Federalist vice president rather than Monroe's running mate Daniel D. Tompkins: those for [[Richard Stockton (U.S. Senator)|Richard Stockton]] came from [[Massachusetts]], while the entire [[Delaware]] delegation voted for [[Daniel Rodney]] for Vice President, and [[Robert Goodloe Harper]]'s vice presidential vote was cast by an elector from his home state of [[Maryland]]. In any case, these breaks in ranks were not enough to deny Tompkins a substantial electoral college victory.\n\nMonroe's share of the [[List of United States presidential elections by Electoral College margin|share of the electoral vote]] has not been exceeded by any candidate since, with the closest competition coming from [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s landslide [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]] victory. \n\nOnly Washington, who won the vote of each presidential elector in the [[1788\u201389 United States presidential election|1789]] and [[1792 United States presidential election|1792]] presidential elections, can claim to have swept the Electoral College.\n\nWashington's campaigns took place prior to the 1804 ratification of the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] instituting the current system, where each member of the Electoral College casts one vote for president and one vote for vice president. \n\nUnder the original system, each elector cast two votes, with no distinction being made between the votes for president and for vice president. Thus, in both of his campaigns, this meant Washington won the maximum number of electoral votes possible for any candidate, as opposed to winning 50% of the total electoral votes cast.\n\n{{start U.S. vice presidential election box|ev_footnote=}}\n{{U.S. vice presidential election box row|name=[[Daniel D.

Only 40 delegates attended, with few or no delegates from the large states of Virginia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Massachusetts, and New Jersey. Rather than name the president with only a handful of votes, the caucus declined to make a formal nomination. [[Richard Mentor Johnson|Richard M. Johnson]] offered the following resolution: \"It is inexpedient, at this time, to proceed to the nomination of persons for the offices of President and Vice President of the United States.\" After debate, the resolution was unanimously adopted, and the meeting adjourned. President Monroe and Vice President Daniel D. Tompkins thus became de ''facto'' candidates for re-election.\n\nIn the run-up to the caucus, Tompkins made another run for his former post of [[Governor of New York]], leading to potential replacements being informally discussed among the party leadership. The matter was ultimately rendered moot when Tompkins lost the [[1820 New York gubernatorial election|election]] shortly before the nominating caucus took place, and though some within the party remained dissatisfied with Tompkins' performance as Vice President, the role was not considered important enough to be worth a formal nomination process after his ability to continue in the office was confirmed.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|+Informal Ballot\n|-\n!Presidential Ballot!! !!Vice Presidential Ballot!!\n|-\n![[James Monroe]] !!40!!

This law stated that \"the said state, when formed, shall be admitted into the Union, upon an equal footing with the original states, in all respects whatsoever.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=United States Congress |others=Act of March 6, ch. 23, vol. 3 |title=United States Statutes at Large |url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(sj06845)) |accessdate=August 9, 2006 |year=1820 |pages=545\u2013548}}</ref> However, when Congress reconvened in November 1820, the admission of Missouri became an issue of contention. Proponents claimed that Missouri had fulfilled the conditions of the law and therefore was a state; detractors contended that certain provisions of the Missouri Constitution violated the United States Constitution.\n\nBy the time Congress was due to meet to count the electoral votes from the election, this dispute had lasted over two months. The counting raised a ticklish problem: if Congress counted Missouri's votes, that would count as recognition that Missouri was a state; on the other hand, if Congress failed to count Missouri's vote, it would count as recognition that Missouri was not a state. Knowing ahead of time that Monroe had won in a landslide and that Missouri's vote would therefore make no difference in the final result, the Senate passed a resolution on February 13, 1821 stating that if a protest were made, there would be no consideration of the matter unless the vote of Missouri would change who would become president. Instead, the President of the Senate would announce the final tally twice, once with Missouri included and once with it excluded.<ref>{{cite book |author=United States Congress |others=16th Congress, 2nd Session, February 13 |title=Senate Journal |url=http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(sj01070)) |accessdate=July 29, 2006 |year=1821 |pages=187\u2013188}}</ref>\n\nThe next day this resolution was introduced in the full House. After a lively debate, it was passed. Nonetheless, during the counting of the electoral votes on February 14, 1821, an objection was raised to the votes from Missouri by Representative [[Arthur Livermore]] of New Hampshire. He argued that since Missouri had not yet officially become a state, it had no right to cast any electoral votes. Immediately, Representative [[John Floyd (Virginia politician)|John Floyd]] of Virginia argued that Missouri's votes must be counted. Chaos ensued, and order was restored only with the counting of the vote as per the resolution and then adjournment for the day.<ref>{{cite book |publisher=Gales and Seaton |others=16th Congress, 2nd Session, February 14, 1821 |title=Annals of Congress |url=http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(sj01070)) |accessdate=July 29, 2006 |year=1856 |pages=1147\u20131165}}</ref>\n\n==Results==\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1820-Large.png|thumb|500px]]\n\n===Popular vote===\nThe Federalists received a small amount of the popular vote despite having no electoral candidates.

Plumer cast his electoral ballot for [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] John Quincy Adams. While legend has it this was to ensure that George Washington would remain the only American president unanimously chosen by the Electoral College, that was not Plumer's goal. In fact, Plumer simply thought that Monroe was a mediocre president and that Adams would be a better one.<ref>Turner (1955) p 253</ref> Plumer also refused to vote for Tompkins for Vice President as \"grossly intemperate\", not having \"that weight of character which his office requires,\" and \"because he grossly neglected his duty\" in his \"only\" official role as President of the Senate by being \"absent nearly three-fourths of the time\";<ref>[https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_Daniel_Tompkins.htm \"Daniel D. Tompkins, 6th Vice President (1817-1825)\"] United States Senate web site.</ref> Plumer instead voted for [[Richard Rush]].\n\nEven though every member of the Electoral College was pledged to Monroe, there were still a number of Federalist electors who voted for a Federalist vice president rather than Monroe's running mate Daniel D. Tompkins: those for [[Richard Stockton (U.S. Senator)|Richard Stockton]] came from [[Massachusetts]], while the entire [[Delaware]] delegation voted for [[Daniel Rodney]] for Vice President, and [[Robert Goodloe Harper]]'s vice presidential vote was cast by an elector from his home state of [[Maryland]]. In any case, these breaks in ranks were not enough to deny Tompkins a substantial electoral college victory.\n\nMonroe's share of the [[List of United States presidential elections by Electoral College margin|share of the electoral vote]] has not been exceeded by any candidate since, with the closest competition coming from [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s landslide [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]] victory. \n\nOnly Washington, who won the vote of each presidential elector in the [[1788\u201389 United States presidential election|1789]] and [[1792 United States presidential election|1792]] presidential elections, can claim to have swept the Electoral College.\n\nWashington's campaigns took place prior to the 1804 ratification of the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] instituting the current system, where each member of the Electoral College casts one vote for president and one vote for vice president. \n\nUnder the original system, each elector cast two votes, with no distinction being made between the votes for president and for vice president. Thus, in both of his campaigns, this meant Washington won the maximum number of electoral votes possible for any candidate, as opposed to winning 50% of the total electoral votes cast.\n\n{{start U.S. vice presidential election box|ev_footnote=}}\n{{U.S. vice presidential election box row|name=[[Daniel D.
