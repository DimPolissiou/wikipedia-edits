{"title_page": "Garrett Dillon", "text_new": "'''Garrett (or Gerald)  Dillon''' (c.1640-c.1696) was an Irish [[judge]], politician and soldier, who  held  the office of [[Recorder of Dublin]]. He is  mainly remembered today  as one of the signatories of the [[Treaty of Limerick]], which he  helped to negotiate. The refusal of the [[English Crown]] to abide by the terms of the Treaty led to his downfall. He fled abroad and  died in [[exile]] in France.\n\n==Background==\n\nHe was born in [[County Westmeath]], the  son of Theobald Dillon of [[Portlick Castle]] and his wife Marcella Browne. Theobald was the son of Garrett Dillon of Feamore, [[County Mayo]], who was a cousin of [[Theobald Dillon, 1st Viscount Dillon]].  The younger Garrett inherited both Feamore and Portlick, and acquired other estates in Westmeath and Mayo. All  his estates were forfeited in the 1690s. His eldest son Theobald recovered  some of the family estates, but  not Portlick Castle,  which was acquired by  the Smyth family, who lived there until 1955.\n\n==Career==\n\nHe entered [[Gray's Inn]] in 1669, and was called to the [[Irish Bar]]  in 1674. The  [[Roman Catholic]] King [[James II of England]], who succeeded to the throne  in 1685, adopted  a  policy of appointing as many Catholics as possible to high office. Dillon was described as a \"furious (i.e. passionate)  Catholic\" and was in favour with  the King as a result. His rise  to high office was rapid: he became [[King's Counsel]] and Recorder of Dublin in 1685, and  [[Serjeant-at-law (Ireland)|Prime Serjeant]]  in 1687. In the so-called [[Patriot Parliament]]  of 1689 he sat in the [[Irish House of Commons]]  as member for [[Mullingar (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Mullingar]]. On the outbreak of the [[Williamite War in Ireland|Williamite War]], he entered the military service on King James's side and was made a [[colonel]].\n\n==The Treaty of Limerick and afterwards==\n\nAfter the defeat of the Jacobite cause, the new King [[William III of England]]  was anxious to conciliate as many of his former opponents as possible. One  result of this policy  was the negotiation of the  Treaty of Limerick, which was strictly speaking two treaties, one  military and one  civil. Dillon (who had been dismissed from all his  political  offices) was one of the  three lawyers, the others being John Brown and Sir [[Theobald Butler (solicitor\u2013general)|Toby Butler]], who negotiated the civil articles  on behalf of the defeated Jacobite side, although Butler is believed  to have done most of the hard  work.\n\nThe Treaty articles were signed by Dillon and his colleagues on 3 October 1691. The  terms were surprisingly generous to the defeated side. In particular the Treaty provided that those Jacobites who swore an [[oath of loyalty]] to the new regime who be permitted to retain their lands. Unfortunately for the Jacobites, the [[Parliament of Ireland]] was not prepared to abide by the terms of the Treaty, which it regarded as far too generous to the Jacobites.After months of acrimonious  debate,  Parliament was prorogued without a vote on the Treaty,  and it was never [[ratified]]. Life for Catholics who had supported King James became increasingly difficult: while his co-signatories, Butler and Brown, were left in peace, Dillon was [[proscribed]] and left the country. He joined King James in [[France]], and became a [[colonel]] in his regiment in 1693. He died a few years later, greatly mourned, according to Burke, as a man of \"integrity, eloquence, learning and worth\".\n\n==Family==\n\nDillon married firstly  in 1677  Susanna Clifford, daughter of Thomas Clifford, and widow of [[Sir Edward Crofton, 1st Baronet]] of the [[Crofton Baronets]] of the Mote, [[County Roscommon]] (who had died  in 1675). Dillon and  Susanna  had no children, although Susanna had at least one son,  [[Sir Edward Crofton, 2nd Baronet, of The Mote (1661 creation)|Edward]],  from her first marriage, who succeeded his father as second Baronet.\n\nSir Edward and his stepfather were political opponents, and perhaps also  personal enemies, and Susanna's death sometime before 1689 broke the  family tie between the two men. Edward was a convinced supporter of the [[Glorious Revolution]], and no doubt for that reason the Patriot Parliament, of which Dillon was a prominent member, [[attainted]] him. After the downfall of the Jacobite cause, Edward  quickly recovered his lands and went on to have  a successful political career. There is no reason to think that he made any move to help his stepfather,  nor  perhaps  could Dillon,  after his  own conduct in the Patriot Parliament,  have expected any favours from Edward.\n\nDillon married secondly, before 1690, Mary Hamilton,  posthumous daughter of [[George Hamilton, 4th Baron Hamilton of Strabane]] by  his wife Elizabeth Fagan, by whom he had several children, including Theobald, his  eldest son and heir, who managed to recover at least part of the family estate.\n\n==References==\n* {{citation|last=Burke |first=Oliver  |date=1885 |title=Anecdotes of the Connaught Circuit |publisher=Hodges |publication-place=Dublin |url=https://archive.org/details/anecdotesofconna00burkuoft}}\n*Crofton, Francis  ''The Story of Mote''  1895\n*Kenny, Colum  ''The King's Inns and the Kingdom of Ireland''  Irish Academic Press  Dublin 1992\n*Hart, A.R.

[[Historic counties of Wales|Historically]] part of [[Glamorgan]], Treherbert is a former industrial coal mining village which was at its economic peak between 1850 and 1920. Treherbert is the upper most community of the Rhondda Fawr and encompasses the districts of [[Blaencwm]], [[Blaenrhondda]], [[Tynewydd]] and [[Pen-yr-englyn]].\n\n===Pronunciation===\n'Tre Herbert' is correctly pronounced 'Tree Herbert' 'Tre' loosely translated from Welsh language means 'Hamlet'. \u2018Herbert\u2019 derives from the Earls of Pembrokeshire \u2018the Herberts\u2019 and is derived originally from the Germanic lands.  The first Lord Lieutenant of Gwent (Then Monmouthshire) being the Earl of Pembroke (Henry Herbert).\nThe name \u2018Herbert\u2019, is used variously in Wales to denote street and road names. In one particular area the word though using the original spelling \u2018Tre Herbert Road\u2019 in Monmouthshire is pronounced entirely differently.  Some of the local inhabitants pronounce it thusly \u201cTree Harbour Road\u201d.  The exact reasons for this distortion are unclear but it is likely to be due to what is commonly known as the \u201cMrs Bucket\u2019 effect\u201d.  That is to say, wary of association with a valleys\u2019 mining town (Tre Herbert) and keen to distinguish themselves from it, the locals adopted the rather bizarre pronunciation \u2018Harbour\u2019  (or US version \u2018Harbor\u2019).  Nowhere else in the English or indeed Welsh language can similar pronunciation of \u2018Bert\u2019 be found to be \u2018Bour\u2019.  \nThe practice is best characterised as a reverse shibboleth, thus any person correctly pronouncing the words \u2018Tre Herbert Road\u2019 can immediately be identified as outsiders and rather impolitely and erroneously corrected by residents of longer standing.  If in doubt about this extraordinary collective exemplification of banal snobbery one may easily ask someone in the area to name the mining village in the Valleys and they will correctly pronounce it 'Tree Herbert' yet, insist the correct pronunciation when the phrase has the suffix 'Road' be 'Tree Harbour'.\n\n==History==\nThere is evidence of settlements in the Rhondda dating back to [[Celt]]ic times, but prior to the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the advent of [[coal mining]] the villages of Treherbert, Tynewydd, Blaenrhondda and Blaencwm consisted of a number of isolated [[rural]] farms and scattered homesteads. In 1841 there were only 218 people residing in the 'Middle hamlet of Treherbert', which had risen to 1,203 by 1861.<ref>[http://webapps.rhondda-cynon-taf.gov.uk/heritagetrail/rhondda/treherbert/Treherbert.htm Rhondda Cynon Taf<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820232026/http://webapps.rhondda-cynon-taf.gov.uk/heritagetrail/rhondda/treherbert/treherbert.htm |date=2008-08-20 }}</ref>\n\nIn August 1845, the trustees of the [[Marquess of Bute]] bought the Cwmsaerbren farm from William Davies for a fee of \u00a311,000 to sink the first steam [[coal]] pit in the Rhondda valley. A trial pit was sunk from 1850, but progress was slow because all equipment was carried over rough tracks by horse and cart from the [[Taff Vale Railway]]'s then terminus at [[Dinas Rhondda railway station|Dinas]]. In April 1853 the first seam of what was called the [[Bute Merthyr Colliery]] was struck at a depth of 125&nbsp;yards, and production was begun in early 1855.\n\nParish records showed the first use of the name Treherbert from January 1855, commemorating the [[Earl of Pembroke#Herbert|Herbert earls of Pembroke]], one of the ancestors of the [[Marquess of Bute]].<ref>''The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales''. [[John Davies (historian)|John Davies]], [[Nigel Jenkins]], Menna Baines and Peredur Lynch (2008) pg746 {{ISBN|978-0-7083-1953-6}}</ref> The first 38 wagons of steam coal were transported from the newly extended Taff Vale Railway station at [[Gelligaled]] (Ystrad) to [[Cardiff Docks]] on 21 December 1855. Installation of the railway line facilitated the rapid expansion of the village, and the need to build new houses, the first rows of which were built at Bute Street, Dumfries Street, and Baglan Street.\n\n==Transport==\nThe main road in the northerly direction out of Treherbert is the [[A4061 road|A4061 Rhigos Mountain Road]] towards [[Hirwaun]] and the [[A465 road|A465]] Heads of the Valleys Road. It was built as a relief project for unemployed miners and opened in November 1929.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/19th-november-1929/46/a-swansea-appeal-disallowed|title=Expediting Traffic in Wales|work=Commercial Motor|date=19 November 1929|accessdate=5 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Railway===\n[[Treherbert railway station]] is the last stop on the [[Transport for Wales Rail|Transport for Wales]] Treherbert line, which runs from the [[capital city]], [[Cardiff]]. Prior to the [[Beeching Axe|Dr Beeching]] plans in the 1960s the railway line continued from Treherbert through Tynewydd to [[Blaencwm]]. From here it turned left at Pen Pych into Blaencwm. In Blaencwm, the line descended into a single-track tunnel under Mynydd Blaengwynfi, emerging in the village of [[Blaengwynfi]] in the nearby Afan valley. The journey took approximately 8 minutes.\n\n==Sport==\nTreherbert is home to [[rugby union]] club [[Treherbert RFC]]. The team is a member of the [[Welsh Rugby Union]] and was founded by local colliers in 1879.\n\nTreherbert also produced one of Wales' first [[rugby league]] teams, [[Treherbert RLFC]], playing for just two seasons between 1908 and 1910.\n\nTreherbert is also home to Welsh darts player [[Wayne Warren]].\n\n==Music==\nTreherbert Band is one of the longest established bands in the South Wales area. It was originally formed around 1897 as Treherbert Drum and Fife Band, later becoming a brass band associated to the Glenrhondda Colliery.\n\nFollowing the closure of the colliery, the band continued but was renamed variously the Upper Rhondda Band, Treherbert & District Silver Band, Treherbert Band, and now Treherbert & District Band.\n\nThe band has enjoyed many successes in competition, at the National Eisteddfod of Wales, the Mineworkers Open, the National Championships of Great Britain and Wales' annual national competition, the Welsh Regional Championships. During the 1990s the band gained promotion from the fourth section right through to the elite Championship division, and became Welsh League Champions in 2002, Welsh Regional Champions in 2003 and Runner Up Welsh Regional Champions in 2007.\n\nIn 2011 the band became National Eisteddfod Third Division Champions, Runner Up Welsh Regional and Runner Up South Wales Miner's Eisteddfod Champions.\n\n==Notable people==\n:''See [[:Category:People from Treherbert]]''\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080820232026/http://webapps.rhondda-cynon-taf.gov.uk/heritagetrail/rhondda/treherbert/treherbert.htm History of Treherbert at Rhondda Cynon Taf]\n*[https://www.geograph.org.uk/search.php?i=2791294 www.geograph.co.uk : photos of Treherbert and surrounding area]\n*[http://www.treherbertband.weebly.com website of Treherbert & District Band]\n\n{{Rhondda Cynon Taf}}\n{{Rhondda Valley}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Communities in Rhondda Cynon Taf]]\n[[Category:Villages in Rhondda Cynon Taf]]\n[[Category:Rhondda Valley]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{Infobox UK place\n|country = Wales\n|welsh_name=\n|static_image=Treherbert Bute Street.JPG\n|static_image_width=250px\n|static_image_caption=Bute Street, Treherbert (2008)\n|constituency_welsh_assembly= [[Rhondda (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Rhondda]]\n|map_type=\n|official_name= Treherbert\n|coordinates = {{coord|51.6722|-3.5306|display=inline,title}}\n| population = 5,727\n| population_ref = (2011)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=11129832&c=Treherbert&d=16&e=62&g=6495179&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1447761213374&enc=1|title=Community population 2011|accessdate=17 November 2015}}</ref>\n |unitary_wales= [[Rhondda Cynon Taf]]\n|lieutenancy_wales= [[Mid Glamorgan]]\n|constituency_westminster= [[Rhondda (UK Parliament constituency)|Rhondda]]\n|post_town=  [[Treorchy]]\n|postcode_district = CF42 5\n|postcode_area= CF\n|dial_code= 01443\n|os_grid_reference= SS936985\n}}\n\n'''Treherbert''' is a village and [[community (Wales)|community]] situated at the head of the [[Rhondda]] Fawr valley in the [[county borough]] of [[Rhondda Cynon Taf]], Wales.

If in doubt about this extraordinary collective exemplification of banal snobbery one may easily ask someone in the area to name the mining village in the Valleys and they will correctly pronounce it 'Tree Herbert' yet, insist the correct pronunciation when the phrase has the suffix 'Road' be 'Tree Harbour'.\n\n==History==\nThere is evidence of settlements in the Rhondda dating back to [[Celt]]ic times, but prior to the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the advent of [[coal mining]] the villages of Treherbert, Tynewydd, Blaenrhondda and Blaencwm consisted of a number of isolated [[rural]] farms and scattered homesteads. In 1841 there were only 218 people residing in the 'Middle hamlet of Treherbert', which had risen to 1,203 by 1861.<ref>[http://webapps.rhondda-cynon-taf.gov.uk/heritagetrail/rhondda/treherbert/Treherbert.htm Rhondda Cynon Taf<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820232026/http://webapps.rhondda-cynon-taf.gov.uk/heritagetrail/rhondda/treherbert/treherbert.htm |date=2008-08-20 }}</ref>\n\nIn August 1845, the trustees of the [[Marquess of Bute]] bought the Cwmsaerbren farm from William Davies for a fee of \u00a311,000 to sink the first steam [[coal]] pit in the Rhondda valley. A trial pit was sunk from 1850, but progress was slow because all equipment was carried over rough tracks by horse and cart from the [[Taff Vale Railway]]'s then terminus at [[Dinas Rhondda railway station|Dinas]]. In April 1853 the first seam of what was called the [[Bute Merthyr Colliery]] was struck at a depth of 125&nbsp;yards, and production was begun in early 1855.\n\nParish records showed the first use of the name Treherbert from January 1855, commemorating the [[Earl of Pembroke#Herbert|Herbert earls of Pembroke]], one of the ancestors of the [[Marquess of Bute]].<ref>''The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales''.

Installation of the railway line facilitated the rapid expansion of the village, and the need to build new houses, the first rows of which were built at Bute Street, Dumfries Street, and Baglan Street.\n\n==Transport==\nThe main road in the northerly direction out of Treherbert is the [[A4061 road|A4061 Rhigos Mountain Road]] towards [[Hirwaun]] and the [[A465 road|A465]] Heads of the Valleys Road. It was built as a relief project for unemployed miners and opened in November 1929.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/19th-november-1929/46/a-swansea-appeal-disallowed|title=Expediting Traffic in Wales|work=Commercial Motor|date=19 November 1929|accessdate=5 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Railway===\n[[Treherbert railway station]] is the last stop on the [[Transport for Wales Rail|Transport for Wales]] Treherbert line, which runs from the [[capital city]], [[Cardiff]]. Prior to the [[Beeching Axe|Dr Beeching]] plans in the 1960s the railway line continued from Treherbert through Tynewydd to [[Blaencwm]]. From here it turned left at Pen Pych into Blaencwm. In Blaencwm, the line descended into a single-track tunnel under Mynydd Blaengwynfi, emerging in the village of [[Blaengwynfi]] in the nearby Afan valley. The journey took approximately 8 minutes.\n\n==Sport==\nTreherbert is home to [[rugby union]] club [[Treherbert RFC]]. The team is a member of the [[Welsh Rugby Union]] and was founded by local colliers in 1879.\n\nTreherbert also produced one of Wales' first [[rugby league]] teams, [[Treherbert RLFC]], playing for just two seasons between 1908 and 1910.\n\nTreherbert is also home to Welsh darts player [[Wayne Warren]].\n\n==Music==\nTreherbert Band is one of the longest established bands in the South Wales area. It was originally formed around 1897 as Treherbert Drum and Fife Band, later becoming a brass band associated to the Glenrhondda Colliery.\n\nFollowing the closure of the colliery, the band continued but was renamed variously the Upper Rhondda Band, Treherbert & District Silver Band, Treherbert Band, and now Treherbert & District Band.\n\nThe band has enjoyed many successes in competition, at the National Eisteddfod of Wales, the Mineworkers Open, the National Championships of Great Britain and Wales' annual national competition, the Welsh Regional Championships. During the 1990s the band gained promotion from the fourth section right through to the elite Championship division, and became Welsh League Champions in 2002, Welsh Regional Champions in 2003 and Runner Up Welsh Regional Champions in 2007.\n\nIn 2011 the band became National Eisteddfod Third Division Champions, Runner Up Welsh Regional and Runner Up South Wales Miner's Eisteddfod Champions.\n\n==Notable people==\n:''See [[:Category:People from Treherbert]]''\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080820232026/http://webapps.rhondda-cynon-taf.gov.uk/heritagetrail/rhondda/treherbert/treherbert.htm History of Treherbert at Rhondda Cynon Taf]\n*[https://www.geograph.org.uk/search.php?i=2791294 www.geograph.co.uk : photos of Treherbert and surrounding area]\n*[http://www.treherbertband.weebly.com website of Treherbert & District Band]\n\n{{Rhondda Cynon Taf}}\n{{Rhondda Valley}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Communities in Rhondda Cynon Taf]]\n[[Category:Villages in Rhondda Cynon Taf]]\n[[Category:Rhondda Valley]]\n", "name_user": "WereSpielChequers", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treherbert"}

The endoplasm is less transparant and contains paraglycogen giving the cells a brown-yellowish color under the light-miscrope.<ref name=\"canning\"/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vivier |first1=E. |title=L'Organisation Ultrastructurale Corticale de la Gregarine Lecudina pellucida; ses Rapports avec l'Alimentation et la Locomotion |journal=The Journal of Protozoology |date=1968 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=230\u2013246 |doi=10.1111/j.1550-7408.1968.tb02115.x |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1550-7408.1968.tb02115.x |language=en |issn=1550-7408}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schr\u00e9vel |first1=Joseph |title=Protists: An exceptional source of cell models |journal=Biology of the Cell |date=1 January 1994 |volume=80 |issue=2 |pages=241\u2013256 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0248490094900477 |language=en |issn=0248-4900}}</ref>\n\n\n== Lifecycle ==\nThe lifecycle consists of several stadia: gametocyst - oocyst - sporozoite \u2013 trofozoite (chepaline) - gamont (gametocyte, sporadin) \u2013 gametocyst \u2013 oocyst. \nThe gametocyst and oocysts are the cellstructures that can survive outside the [[Host_(biology)|host-organism]] and infect other insects. The cycle starts with the ooccysts that leave the body with the feces and are left on plant-material. When other locust than eat the plant with oocycsts they will burst open (excytation) under the influence of the digestion of the locust. Eight sporozoits will then be released inside the digestive system of the locust.<ref name=\"canning\"/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Janardanan |first1=K.P. |last2=Ramachandran |first2=P. |title=On a new septate gregarine, Stenoductus polydesmi sp. n.
