In 1963, he moved to the [[University of M\u00fcnster]]. During this period, he participated in the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962\u20131965) and served as a ''[[peritus]]'' (theological consultant) to [[Josef Frings|Cardinal Frings of Cologne]]. He was viewed during the time of the Council as a reformer, cooperating with theologians like [[Hans K\u00fcng]] and [[Edward Schillebeeckx]]. Ratzinger became an admirer of [[Karl Rahner]], a well-known academic theologian of the [[Nouvelle Th\u00e9ologie]] and a proponent of church reform.\n\nIn 1966, Ratzinger was appointed to a chair in dogmatic theology at the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]], where he was a colleague of [[Hans K\u00fcng]]. In his 1968 book ''[[Introduction to Christianity]]'', he wrote that the pope has a duty to hear differing voices within the Church before making a decision, and he downplayed the centrality of the papacy. During this time, he distanced himself from the atmosphere of T\u00fcbingen and the [[Marxism|Marxist]] leanings of the student movement of the 1960s that quickly radicalised, in the years 1967 and 1968, culminating in a series of disturbances and riots in April and May 1968.

Later, as the [[Joseph Ratzinger as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], Ratzinger most clearly spelled out the Catholic Church's position on other religions in the 2000 document ''[[Dominus Iesus]]'' which also talks about the Catholic way to engage in \"[[Catholic Church and ecumenism|ecumenical]] dialogue\". During his time at T\u00fcbingen University, Ratzinger published articles in the reformist theological journal ''[[Concilium (journal)|Concilium]]'', though he increasingly chose less reformist themes than other contributors to the magazine such as K\u00fcng and Schillebeeckx.\n\nIn 1969, he returned to Bavaria, to the [[University of Regensburg]] and co-founded the theological journal ''[[Communio]]'', with [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]], [[Henri de Lubac]], [[Walter Kasper]] and others, in 1972. ''Communio'', now published in seventeen languages, including German, English and Spanish, has become a prominent journal of contemporary Catholic theological thought. Until his election as pope, he remained one of the journal's most prolific contributors.

[[Pope Benedict XV]] was pope during the First World War, during which time he passionately pursued peace between the warring nations. St. Benedict of Nursia was the founder of the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monasteries (most monasteries of the Middle Ages were of the Benedictine order) and the author of the ''[[Rule of Saint Benedict]]'', which is still the most influential writing regarding the monastic life of Western Christianity. The Pope explained his choice of name during his first general audience in St. Peter's Square, on 27 April 2005:\n\n{{quote|Filled with sentiments of awe and thanksgiving, I wish to speak of why I chose the name Benedict. Firstly, I remember [[Pope Benedict XV]], that courageous prophet of peace, who guided the Church through turbulent times of war.

(The cardinals had formally sworn their obedience upon his election.) He began using an open-topped [[Popemobile|papal car]], saying that he wanted to be closer to the people. Pope Benedict continued the tradition of his predecessor John Paul II and baptised several infants in the Sistine Chapel at the beginning of each year, in his pastoral role as Bishop of Rome.\n\n====Beatifications====\nOn 9 May 2005, Benedict XVI began the [[beatification]] process for his predecessor, Pope John Paul II. Normally, five years must pass after a person's death before the beatification process can begin. However, in an audience with Pope Benedict, [[Camillo Ruini]], [[Vicar General]] of the Diocese of Rome and the official responsible for promoting the [[canonization|cause for canonization]] of any person who dies within that diocese, cited \"exceptional circumstances\" which suggested that the waiting period could be waived. This happened before, when Pope Paul VI waived the five-year rule and announced beatification processes for two of his predecessors, [[Pope Pius XII]] and [[Pope John XXIII]].

At the root of this problem, he said, is [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s \"self-limitation of reason\". This, he said, is contradictory to the modern acclamation of science whose excellence is based on the power of reason to know the truth. He said that this self-amputation of reason leads to pathologies of religion such as terrorism and pathologies of science such as [[List of environmental disasters|ecological disasters]].<ref name=TT>{{cite book |title=Truth And Tolerance: Christian Belief And World Religions |last=Ratzinger |first=Joseph |year=2003 |publisher=[[Ignatius Press]]|isbn=1-58617-035-X |url=}}</ref> Benedict traced the failed revolutions and violent ideologies of the 20th century to a conversion of partial points of view into absolute guides.

He said:\n{{quote|From the beginning, Christianity has understood itself as the religion of the ''Logos'', as the religion according to reason... It has always defined men, all men without distinction, as creatures and images of God, proclaiming for them...the same dignity. In this connection, the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] is of Christian origin and it is no accident that it was born precisely and exclusively in the realm of the Christian faith....It was and is the merit of the Enlightenment to have again proposed these original values of Christianity and of having given back to reason its own voice... Today, this should be precisely [Christianity's] philosophical strength, in so far as the problem is whether the world comes from the irrational, and reason is not other than a 'sub-product,' on occasion even harmful of its development\u2014or whether the world comes from reason, and is, as a consequence, its criterion and goal...In the so necessary dialogue between secularists and Catholics, we Christians must be very careful to remain faithful to this fundamental line: to live a faith that comes from the ''Logos'', from creative reason, and that, because of this, is also open to all that is truly rational.<ref name=Zenit05>{{cite news |author=Drummer, Alexander |url=http://www.zenit.org/article-13705?l=english |title=Cardinal Ratzinger on Europe's Crisis of Culture (Part 4) |agency=[[Zenit News Agency]] |date=29 July 2005 |accessdate=24 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001064719/http://www.zenit.org/article-13705?l=english |archivedate=1 October 2012}}</ref>}}\n\nBenedict also emphasised that \"Only creative reason, which in the crucified God is manifested as love, can really show us the way.\"<ref name=Zenit05 />\n\n====Encyclicals====\n<!--Please note, encyclical dates are based on the date listed within the text, not the release date{|\n|- align=left\n!No. !! !!

In 1963, he moved to the [[University of M\u00fcnster]]. During this period, he participated in the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962\u20131965) and served as a ''[[peritus]]'' (theological consultant) to [[Josef Frings|Cardinal Frings of Cologne]]. He was viewed during the time of the Council as a reformer, cooperating with theologians like [[Hans K\u00fcng]] and [[Edward Schillebeeckx]]. Ratzinger became an admirer of [[Karl Rahner]], a well-known academic theologian of the [[Nouvelle Th\u00e9ologie]] and a proponent of church reform.\n\nIn 1966, Ratzinger was appointed to a chair in dogmatic theology at the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]], where he was a colleague of [[Hans K\u00fcng]]. In his 1968 book ''[[Introduction to Christianity]]'', he wrote that the pope has a duty to hear differing voices within the Church before making a decision, and he downplayed the centrality of the papacy. During this time, he distanced himself from the atmosphere of T\u00fcbingen and the [[Marxism|Marxist]] leanings of the student movement of the 1960s that quickly radicalised, in the years 1967 and 1968, culminating in a series of disturbances and riots in April and May 1968.

Later, as the [[Joseph Ratzinger as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], Ratzinger most clearly spelled out the Catholic Church's position on other religions in the 2000 document ''[[Dominus Iesus]]'' which also talks about the Catholic way to engage in \"[[Catholic Church and ecumenism|ecumenical]] dialogue\". During his time at T\u00fcbingen University, Ratzinger published articles in the reformist theological journal ''[[Concilium (journal)|Concilium]]'', though he increasingly chose less reformist themes than other contributors to the magazine such as K\u00fcng and Schillebeeckx.\n\nIn 1969, he returned to Bavaria, to the [[University of Regensburg]] and co-founded the theological journal ''[[Communio]]'', with [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]], [[Henri de Lubac]], [[Walter Kasper]] and others, in 1972. ''Communio'', now published in seventeen languages, including German, English and Spanish, has become a prominent journal of contemporary Catholic theological thought.

[[Pope Benedict XV]] was pope during the First World War, during which time he passionately pursued peace between the warring nations. St. Benedict of Nursia was the founder of the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monasteries (most monasteries of the Middle Ages were of the Benedictine order) and the author of the ''[[Rule of Saint Benedict]]'', which is still the most influential writing regarding the monastic life of Western Christianity. The Pope explained his choice of name during his first general audience in St. Peter's Square, on 27 April 2005:\n\n{{quote|Filled with sentiments of awe and thanksgiving, I wish to speak of why I chose the name Benedict. Firstly, I remember [[Pope Benedict XV]], that courageous prophet of peace, who guided the Church through turbulent times of war.

(The cardinals had formally sworn their obedience upon his election.) He began using an open-topped [[Popemobile|papal car]], saying that he wanted to be closer to the people. Pope Benedict continued the tradition of his predecessor John Paul II and baptised several infants in the Sistine Chapel at the beginning of each year, in his pastoral role as Bishop of Rome.\n\n====Beatifications====\nOn 9 May 2005, Benedict XVI began the [[beatification]] process for his predecessor, Pope John Paul II. Normally, five years must pass after a person's death before the beatification process can begin. However, in an audience with Pope Benedict, [[Camillo Ruini]], [[Vicar General]] of the Diocese of Rome and the official responsible for promoting the [[canonization|cause for canonization]] of any person who dies within that diocese, cited \"exceptional circumstances\" which suggested that the waiting period could be waived. This happened before, when Pope Paul VI waived the five-year rule and announced beatification processes for two of his predecessors, [[Pope Pius XII]] and [[Pope John XXIII]].

At the root of this problem, he said, is [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s \"self-limitation of reason\".

He said that this self-amputation of reason leads to pathologies of religion such as terrorism and pathologies of science such as [[List of environmental disasters|ecological disasters]].<ref name=TT>{{cite book |title=Truth And Tolerance: Christian Belief And World Religions |last=Ratzinger |first=Joseph |year=2003 |publisher=[[Ignatius Press]]|isbn=1-58617-035-X |url= }}</ref> Benedict traced the failed revolutions and violent ideologies of the 20th century to a conversion of partial points of view into absolute guides.

He said:\n{{quote|From the beginning, Christianity has understood itself as the religion of the ''Logos'', as the religion according to reason... It has always defined men, all men without distinction, as creatures and images of God, proclaiming for them...the same dignity. In this connection, the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] is of Christian origin and it is no accident that it was born precisely and exclusively in the realm of the Christian faith....It was and is the merit of the Enlightenment to have again proposed these original values of Christianity and of having given back to reason its own voice... Today, this should be precisely [Christianity's] philosophical strength, in so far as the problem is whether the world comes from the irrational, and reason is not other than a 'sub-product,' on occasion even harmful of its development\u2014or whether the world comes from reason, and is, as a consequence, its criterion and goal...In the so necessary dialogue between secularists and Catholics, we Christians must be very careful to remain faithful to this fundamental line: to live a faith that comes from the ''Logos'', from creative reason, and that, because of this, is also open to all that is truly rational.<ref name=Zenit05>{{cite news |author=Drummer, Alexander |url=http://www.zenit.org/article-13705?l=english |title=Cardinal Ratzinger on Europe's Crisis of Culture (Part 4) |agency=[[Zenit News Agency]] |date=29 July 2005 |accessdate=24 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001064719/http://www.zenit.org/article-13705?l=english |archivedate=1 October 2012 |df= }}</ref>}}\n\nBenedict also emphasised that \"Only creative reason, which in the crucified God is manifested as love, can really show us the way.\"<ref name=Zenit05 />\n\n====Encyclicals====\n<!--Please note, encyclical dates are based on the date listed within the text, not the release date{|\n|- align=left\n!No. !! !!
