Count should not exceed 700 words. -->\nIn 1978, narcissistic, manipulative actress Madeline Ashton performs in an awful musical version of ''[[Sweet Bird of Youth]]'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. She invites long-time friend Helen Sharp, an aspiring writer, backstage along with Helen's fianc\u00e9, plastic surgeon Ernest Menville. Ernest is smitten with Madeline, and breaks off his engagement with Helen to marry her. Seven years later, Helen is obese, depressed and committed to a psychiatric hospital where she begins plotting revenge on Madeline.\n\nAnother seven years later, Madeline and Ernest live in Beverly Hills, but they are miserable: Madeline's acting career is declining and Ernest is an alcoholic reduced to working as a [[Embalming#Specialist embalming|reconstructive mortician]]. Receiving an invitation to a party celebrating Helen's new book, Madeline rushes to a spa where she regularly receives facial treatments. Understanding Madeline's situation, the spa owner gives her the business card of Lisle Von Rhuman, a mysterious, glamorous, wealthy socialite specializing in youth rejuvenation.\n\nMadeline and Ernest attend the party for Helen's novel, ''Forever Young'', and discover that somehow, Helen is slim, youthful, and beautiful. Dumbfounded and depressed by Helen's appearance, and upon secretly witnessing Helen tell Ernest that she blames her for his career decline, Madeline visits her young lover, but discovers he is with a woman his age. Dejected, Madeline drives to Lisle's home. Lisle, claiming to be 71, but looking decades younger, reveals the secret of her beauty and youth\u2014an expensive [[Elixir of life|potion that promises eternal life and an everlasting youthful appearance]]. Madeline purchases and drinks the potion and is rejuvenated, regaining her beauty. As a condition of purchase, Lisle warns Madeline to disappear from public life after ten years to keep the existence of the potion secret, and to take good care of her body.\n\nHelen seduces Ernest and convinces him to kill Madeline. When Madeline returns home, she and Ernest argue, during which she falls down the stairs, breaking her neck. Believing Madeline dead, Ernest phones Helen for advice, initially not seeing Madeline stand and approach him with her head twisted backward. At Madeline's request, Ernest drives her to the emergency room. Madeline is told she is technically dead, and faints. She is taken to the [[morgue]] due to her body having no pulse and a temperature below 80&nbsp;\u00b0F. After rescuing Madeline, Ernest considers her resurrection a miracle and uses his skills as a mortician to repair her body at home.\n\nHelen demands information about Madeline's situation. Overhearing Helen and Ernest discussing their plot to kill her, Madeline shoots Helen with a shotgun. Although the blast creates a hole in her abdomen, Helen survives, revealing that she drank the same potion. The two briefly fight before apologizing and reconciling their friendship. Fed up with the pair, Ernest prepares to leave, but Helen and Madeline convince him to do one last repair on their bodies. They realize they will need regular maintenance and scheme to have Ernest drink the potion to ensure he will always be available.\n\nAfter bringing Ernest to Lisle, she offers to give him the potion free of charge in exchange for his surgical skills. Ernest refuses to drink it when he realizes the pitfalls of immortality. He pockets the potion and flees, but becomes trapped on the roof. Helen and Madeline implore Ernest to drink the potion to survive an impending fall. Ernest, realizing that they only need him for their own selfish reasons, refuses and drops the potion to the ground, but after falling he lands in Lisle's pool and escapes. Lisle banishes Madeline and Helen from her group, leaving the pair to rely on each other for companionship and maintenance.\n\nThirty-seven years later, Madeline and Helen attend Ernest's funeral, where he is eulogized as having lived an adventurous and fulfilling life with a large family and friends. The two women are parodies of their former selves, with cracked, peeling paint and putty covering most of their grey and rotting flesh. Helen trips at the top of a staircase. When Madeline hesitates to help her, Helen grabs Madeline and the two tumble down the stairs, breaking to pieces. As their disembodied heads totter down together, Helen sardonically asks Madeline where she parked their car.\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding text.

Believing Madeline dead, Ernest phones Helen for advice, initially not seeing Madeline stand and approach him with her head twisted backward. At Madeline's request, Ernest drives her to the emergency room. Madeline is told she is technically dead, and faints. She is taken to the [[morgue]] due to her body having no pulse and a temperature below 80&nbsp;\u00b0F. After rescuing Madeline, Ernest considers her resurrection a miracle and uses his skills as a mortician to repair her body at home.\n\nHelen demands information about Madeline's situation. Overhearing Helen and Ernest discussing their plot to kill her, Madeline shoots Helen with a shotgun. Although the blast creates a hole in her abdomen, Helen survives, revealing that she drank the same potion. The two briefly fight before apologizing and reconciling their friendship. Fed up with the pair, Ernest prepares to leave, but Helen and Madeline convince him to do one last repair on their bodies. They realize they will need regular maintenance and scheme to have Ernest drink the potion to ensure he will always be available.\n\nAfter bringing Ernest to Lisle, she offers to give him the potion free of charge in exchange for his surgical skills. Ernest refuses to drink it when he realizes the pitfalls of immortality. He pockets the potion and flees, but becomes trapped on the roof. Helen and Madeline implore Ernest to drink the potion to survive an impending fall. Ernest, realizing that they only need him for their own selfish reasons, refuses and drops the potion to the ground, but after falling he lands in Lisle's pool and escapes. Lisle banishes Madeline and Helen from her group, leaving the pair to rely on each other for companionship and maintenance.\n\nThirty-seven years later, Madeline and Helen attend Ernest's funeral, where he is eulogized as having lived an adventurous and fulfilling life with a large family and friends. The two women are parodies of their former selves, with cracked, peeling paint and putty covering most of their grey and rotting flesh. Helen trips at the top of a staircase. When Madeline hesitates to help her, Helen grabs Madeline and the two tumble down the stairs, breaking to pieces. As their disembodied heads totter down together, Helen sardonically asks Madeline where she parked their car.\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding text.

In addition to the income from the fur business, both of Henie's parents had inherited wealth. Wilhelm Henie had been a one-time [[UCI Track Cycling World Championships|World Cycling Champion]] and the Henie children were encouraged to take up a variety of sports at a young age. Henie initially showed talent at [[skiing]], then followed her older brother, Leif, to take up [[figure skating]]. As a girl Henie also was a nationally ranked [[tennis]] player, and a skilled [[swimming (sport)|swimmer]] and [[equestrianism|equestrienne]]. Once Henie began serious training as a figure skater, her formal schooling ended. She was educated by tutors, and her father hired the best experts in the world, including the famous Russian ballerina, [[Tamara Karsavina]], to transform his daughter into a sporting celebrity.<ref>[http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Sonja_Henie/utdypning '&#39;Sonja Henie/utdypning'&#39; (Store norske leksikon)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008193424/http://snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Sonja_Henie/utdypning |date=8 October 2012 }}. Snl.no. Retrieved on 19 August 2015.</ref>\n\n===Competitive career===\nHenie won her first major competition, the senior Norwegian championships, at the age of 10. She then placed eighth in a field of eight at the [[1924 Winter Olympics]], at the age of eleven.<ref name=sr>[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/he/sonja-henie-1.html Sonja Heni] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309082541/http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/he/sonja-henie-1.html |date=9 March 2010 }}. sports-reference.com</ref> During the 1924 program, she skated over to the side of the rink several times to ask her coach for directions, but by the next Olympiad, she needed no such assistance.\n\nHenie won the first of an unprecedented ten consecutive World Figure Skating Championships in 1927 at the age of fourteen. The results of 1927 World Championships, where Henie won in 3\u20132 decision (or 7 vs. 8 ordinal points) over the defending Olympic and World Champion [[Herma Szabo]] of [[Austria]], was controversial, as three of the five judges that gave Henie first-place ordinals were Norwegian (1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 7 points) while Szabo received first-place ordinals from an Austrian and a German Judge (1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 points). Henie went on to win first of her three [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medals the following year, became one of the [[List of Olympic medalists in figure skating by age#Youngest champions|youngest]] figure skating Olympic champions. She defended her Olympic titles in 1932 and in 1936, and her world titles annually until 1936.<ref name=sr/> She also won six consecutive European championships from 1931 to 1936. Henie's unprecedented three Olympic gold medals haven't been matched by any ladies' single skater since; neither are her achievements as ten-time consecutive World Champion. While [[Irina Slutskaya]] of Russia won her seventh European Championship in 2006 to become the most successful ladies' skater in European Championships, Henie retains record of most consecutive titles, sharing it with [[Katarina Witt]] of [[Eastern Germany]]/[[Germany]] (1983\u20131988).\n\nTowards the end of her career, she began to be strongly challenged by younger skaters including [[Cecilia Colledge]], [[Megan Taylor]], and [[Hedy Stenuf]]. However, she held off these competitors and went on to win her third Olympic title at the [[1936 Winter Olympics]], albeit in very controversial circumstances with Cecilia Colledge finishing a very close second. Indeed, after the school figures section at the 1936 Olympic competition, Colledge and Henie were virtually neck and neck with Colledge trailing by just a few points. As Sandra Stevenson recounted in her article in ''[[The Independent]]'' of 21 April 2008, \"the closeness [of the competition] infuriated Henie, who, when the result for that section was posted on a wall in the competitors' lounge, swiped the piece of paper and tore it into little pieces. The draw for the free skating [then] came under suspicion after Henie landed the plum position of skating last, while Colledge had to perform second of the 26 competitors. The early start was seen as a disadvantage, with the audience not yet whipped into a clapping frenzy and the judges known to become freer with their higher marks as the event proceeded. Years later, a fairer, staggered draw was adopted to counteract this situation\".\n\nDuring her competitive career, Henie traveled widely and worked with a variety of foreign coaches. At home in Oslo, she trained at [[Frogner|Frogner Stadium]], where her coaches included Hj\u00f8rdis Olsen and Oscar Holte. During the latter part of her competitive career she was coached primarily by the American Howard Nicholson in [[London]]. In addition to traveling to train and compete, she was much in demand as a performer at figure skating exhibitions in both Europe and North America. Henie became so popular with the public that police had to be called out for crowd control on her appearances in various disparate cities such as [[Prague]] and [[New York City]]. It was an open secret that, in spite of the strict [[amateur sports|amateurism]] requirements of the time, Wilhelm Henie demanded \"expense money\" for his daughter's skating appearances. Both of Henie's parents had given up their own pursuits in Norway\u2014leaving Leif to run the fur business\u2014in order to accompany Sonja on her travels and act as her managers.\n\nHenie is credited with being the first figure skater to adopt the short skirt costume in figure skating, wear white boots,<ref name=\"Jacobs\">{{cite news |last1=Jacobs |first1=Laura |title=Sonja Henie's Ice Age |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/02/sonja-henie-ice-skating-queen |accessdate=3 September 2018 |work=Vanity Fair |date=11 February 2014}}</ref> and make use of dance [[choreography]].

After the success of her first film, ''[[One in a Million (1936 film)|One in a Million]]'' (1936), Henie's position was assured and she became increasingly demanding in her business dealings with Zanuck. Henie also insisted on having total control of the skating numbers in her films such as ''[[Second Fiddle (1939 film)|Second Fiddle]]'' (1939).\n\nHenie tried to break the musical comedy mould with the anti-Nazi film ''[[Everything Happens at Night]]'' (1939) and ''[[It's a Pleasure (film)|It's a Pleasure]]'' (1945), a skating variation of the often-told ''[[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' tale about alcoholic-star-in-decline-helps-newcomer-up. It was her only film shot in [[Technicolor]], but it was not as huge at the box office as her other films and also proved her limitations as a dramatic actress in her one only dramatic film.\n\nWhen Zanuck realized her limits in the pseudo-dramatic vein, he cast her in more musical comedies; ''[[Sun Valley Serenade]]'' (1941) with [[Glenn Miller]], [[John Payne (actor)|John Payne]], [[The Nicholas Brothers]], and hit songs such as \"[[In the Mood]]\", \"[[Chattanooga Choo Choo]]\", \"[[It Happened in Sun Valley]]\", and \"[[I Know Why (And So Do You)]]\", followed by ''[[Iceland (film)|Iceland]]'' (1942) with [[Jack Oakie]], Payne, and the hit song \"[[There Will Never Be Another You]]\", and finally ''[[Wintertime (film)|Wintertime]]'' (1943) with [[Cesar Romero]], [[Carole Landis]], [[Cornel Wilde]], and Oakie. Sonja had by now developed a comedy flair and these films were all among the top box-office hits for [[20th Century-Fox]] the respective years.\n\nIn addition to her film career at Fox from 1936 to 1943, Henie formed a business arrangement with [[Arthur Wirtz]], who produced her touring ice shows under the name of \"Hollywood Ice Revue\". Wirtz also acted as Henie's financial advisor. At the time, figure skating and ice shows were not yet an established form of entertainment in the United States. Henie's popularity as a film actress attracted many new fans and instituted skating shows as a popular new entertainment. Throughout the 1940s, Henie and Wirtz produced lavish musical ice skating extravaganzas at [[Rockefeller Center]]'s [[Center Theatre (New York, New York)|Center Theatre]] attracting millions of ticket buyers.\n\nAt the height of her fame, Henie brought as much as $2 million per year from her shows and touring activities. She also had numerous lucrative endorsement contracts, and deals to market skates, clothing, jewelry, dolls, and other merchandise branded with her name. These activities made her one of the wealthiest women in the world in her time.\n[[File:Sonja Henie graumans.jpg|thumb|left|Henie's handprint/signature in front of the [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]]]]\nHenie broke off her arrangement with Wirtz in 1950 and for the next three seasons produced her own tours under the name \"Sonja Henie Ice Revue\". It was an ill-advised decision to set herself up in competition with Wirtz, whose shows now featured the new Olympic champion [[Barbara Ann Scott]]. Since Wirtz controlled the best arenas and dates, Henie was left playing smaller venues and markets already saturated by other touring ice shows such as [[Ice Capades]]. The collapse of a section of bleachers during a show in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], in 1952 compounded the tour's legal and financial woes.\n\nIn 1953, Henie formed a new partnership with [[Morris Chalfen]] to appear in his European ''[[Holiday On Ice]]'' tour, which proved to be a great success. She produced her own show at New York's [[Roxy Theatre (New York City)|Roxy Theatre]] in January 1956.<ref>Bosley Crowther, [https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F20A1FF83459157B93C0A8178AD85F428585F9 \"Screen: 'The Lieutenant Wore Skirts\"]. ''The New York Times'', 12 January 1956.</ref> However, a subsequent South American tour in 1956 was a disaster. Henie was drinking heavily at that time and could no longer keep up with the demands of touring, and this marked her retirement from skating. She did try to make a film series at her own expense; a series that would serve as a travelogue to several cities. Paris and London were mentioned, but only ''[[Hello London]]'' (1958) was made with her own backing, co-starring [[Michael Wilding (actor)|Michael Wilding]] and special guest star [[Stanley Holloway]]. While her ice show numbers were still worth watching, the film received few distributors and poor reviews, ending her film career. \n\nHer autobiography ''Mitt livs eventyr'', was published in 1938 which was translated and released as ''Wings on My Feet'' in 1940, and which was republished in a revised edition in 1954. At the time of her death, Henie was planning a comeback for a television special that would have aired in January 1970. She was to have danced to \"[[Lara's Theme]]\" from ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]''.\n\n===Nazi controversy===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-09482, Sonja Henie.jpg|thumb|Henie in Berlin, 1930]]\nHenie's connections with [[Adolf Hitler]] and other high-ranking [[Nazi]] officials made her the subject of controversy before, during, and after [[World War II]]. During her amateur skating career, she performed often in [[Germany]] and was a favorite of German audiences and of Hitler personally. As a wealthy celebrity, she moved in the same social circles as royalty and heads of state and made Hitler's acquaintance as a matter of course. During the shooting of ''[[Second Fiddle (1939 film)|Second Fiddle]]'' (1939), she greeted the then Crown-Prince couple of Norway [[Olav V of Norway|Olav]] and [[Princess M\u00e4rtha of Sweden|M\u00e4rtha]] during their US tour. Through the years, her shows and later art exhibitions drew the attention of such people as [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon]] and [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden]] and she met with them.\n[[File:Sonja Henie & Adolf Hitler 1936.jpg|thumb|left|Henie with Hitler in 1936]]\nControversy appeared first when Henie greeted Hitler with a [[Nazi salute]] at the 1936 Winter Olympics in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]] and after the Games she accepted an invitation to lunch with Hitler at his resort home in nearby [[Berchtesgaden]], where Hitler presented Henie with an autographed photo with a lengthy inscription. She was strongly denounced in the Norwegian press for this. In her revised 1954 biography,<ref group=note>Page 39</ref> she states that no Norwegian judge was in the panel for the 1936 Olympics\u2014as she was entitled to as a Norwegian. She therefore made the most of it and won her third Olympic medal. When she\u2014as a gold medal winner\u2014passed Hitler's tribune with silver medalist [[Cecilia Colledge]] and bronze medalist [[Vivi-Anne Hult\u00e9n]], neither she nor the others honored Hitler with the Nazi salute. The [[1936 European Figure Skating Championships]] also took place in Berlin and neither Henie, Colledge, nor [[Megan Taylor]] paid obeisance to Hitler.{{cn|date=December 2019}} \n\nIn her film ''[[Everything Happens at Night]]'' (1939), [[Ray Milland]] and [[Robert Cummings]] star as rival reporters hot on the trail of Hugo Norden (Maurice Moscovich). Norden, a Nobel Prize winner, was supposedly murdered by the Gestapo, but is rumored to be in hiding and writing anonymous dispatches advocating world peace. When Geoffrey and Ken track Norden to a small village in the Swiss Alps, they soon find themselves competing over the affections of beautiful Louise (Henie), who has a deeper connection to the missing Nobel laureate than the reporters realize. When Geoffrey and Ken get so distracted by romance that they begin to neglect their assignments, it almost leads to disaster as the Gestapo sets out to silence Norden once and for all. Released on 22 December 1939, it was banned in Nazi Germany.\n\nThrough her 1940 marriage to [[Dan Topping]] she had become an American citizen. As such, she was not eligible to speak Norway's cause and with producer [[Alexander Korda]], who was set to produce the propaganda film [[That Hamilton Woman]], could have faced deportation. The Senate Subcommittee (Senate Foreign Relations) dealt with such matters. After the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|bombing of Pearl Harbor]], when America was no longer neutral, Henie pulled in uniform and visited and gave money to [[Little Norway]]. All Norwegians got free tickets to her shows during the war and she paid and held parties for them.\n\nDuring the [[occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany]], German troops saw Hitler's autographed photo prominently displayed at the piano in the Henie family home in [[Land\u00f8ya]], [[Asker]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Sonja Henie|url=http://www.geni.com/people/Sonja-Henie/6000000015540940745|accessdate=27 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702042510/http://www.geni.com/people/Sonja-Henie/6000000015540940745|archive-date=2 July 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> As a result, none of Henie's properties in Norway were confiscated or damaged by the Germans. Henie became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the [[United States]] in 1940. Like many Hollywood stars, she supported the U.S. war effort through [[USO]] and similar activities. After the Japanese attack, she invited the boys from [[Little Norway]] to her ice shows, gave the mechanics a plane as well a substantial sum of money to their educational fund. But her first rejection before the US entered the war was never to be forgotten. For this, she was condemned by many Norwegians and Norwegian-Americans. After the war, Henie was mindful that many of her countrymen considered her to be a [[quisling]]. However, she made a triumphant return to Norway with the [[Holiday on Ice]] tour in 1953 and 1955. The [[Norwegian Royal Family]] attended both events and indeed attended her funeral in 1969. The Royal Family were very mindful of whom they supported after the war and Norwegians looked to them as role models in that respect.\n\n===Personal life===\n{{external media\n| image1 = [http://unitproj.library.ucla.edu/dlib/lat/display.cfm?ms=uclalat_1429_b519_222464 '''Sonja Henie'''] with her art collection in Los Angeles, 1964. Her collection is now held by the [[Henie-Onstad Art Centre]]. }}\n\nHenie was married three times, to [[Dan Topping]] (1940\u20131946), Winthrop Gardiner Jr. (1949\u20131956),<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1980/10/18/archives/winthrop-gardiner-jr-dies-at-67-formerly-owned-gardiners-island.html Obituary: \"Winthrop Gardiner, Jr.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131115112601/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20715F63D5512728DDDA10994D8415B8084F1D3 |date=15 November 2013 }} ''The New York Times''. 18 October 1980.</ref> and the Norwegian shipping magnate and art patron [[Niels Onstad]] (1956\u20131969) (her death).

She was a three-time [[List of Olympic medalists in figure skating|Olympic Champion]] ([[Figure skating at the 1928 Winter Olympics|1928]], [[Figure skating at the 1932 Winter Olympics|1932]], [[Figure skating at the 1936 Winter Olympics|1936]]) in women's Singles, a ten-time [[World Figure Skating Championships|World Champion]] (1927\u20131936) and a six-time [[European Figure Skating Championships|European Champion]] (1931\u20131936). Henie won more Olympic and World titles than any other ladies' figure skater. At the height of her acting career, she was one of the highest-paid stars in [[Cinema in the United States|Hollywood]] and starred in a series of box-office hits, including ''[[Thin Ice (1937 film)|Thin Ice]]'' (1937), [[Happy Landing (1938 film)]], ''[[My Lucky Star (1938 film)|My Lucky Star]]'' (1938), ''[[Second Fiddle (1939 film)|Second Fiddle]]'' (1939) and ''[[Sun Valley Serenade]]'' (1941).<ref>[http://www.snl.no/Sonja_Henie '&#39;Sonja Henie'&#39; (Store norske leksikon)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008193416/http://snl.no/Sonja_Henie |date=8 October 2012 }}. Snl.no (13 March 2014). Retrieved on 19 August 2015.</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nHenie was born in 1912 in Kristiania (now [[Oslo]]) Norway; she was the only daughter of [[Wilhelm Henie]] (1872\u20131937), a prosperous Norwegian [[fur clothing|furrier]], and his wife, Selma Lochmann-Nielsen (1888\u20131961). In addition to the income from the fur business, both of Henie's parents had inherited wealth. Wilhelm Henie had been a one-time [[UCI Track Cycling World Championships|World Cycling Champion]] and the Henie children were encouraged to take up a variety of sports at a young age. Henie initially showed talent at [[skiing]], then followed her older brother, Leif, to take up [[figure skating]]. As a girl Henie also was a nationally ranked [[tennis]] player, and a skilled [[swimming (sport)|swimmer]] and [[equestrianism|equestrienne]]. Once Henie began serious training as a figure skater, her formal schooling ended. She was educated by tutors, and her father hired the best experts in the world, including the famous Russian ballerina, [[Tamara Karsavina]], to transform his daughter into a sporting celebrity.<ref>[http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Sonja_Henie/utdypning '&#39;Sonja Henie/utdypning'&#39; (Store norske leksikon)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008193424/http://snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Sonja_Henie/utdypning |date=8 October 2012 }}. Snl.no. Retrieved on 19 August 2015.</ref>\n\n===Competitive career===\nHenie won her first major competition, the senior Norwegian championships, at the age of 10. She then placed eighth in a field of eight at the [[1924 Winter Olympics]], at the age of eleven.<ref name=sr>[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/he/sonja-henie-1.html Sonja Heni] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309082541/http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/he/sonja-henie-1.html |date=9 March 2010 }}. sports-reference.com</ref> During the 1924 program, she skated over to the side of the rink several times to ask her coach for directions, but by the next Olympiad, she needed no such assistance.\n\nHenie won the first of an unprecedented ten consecutive World Figure Skating Championships in 1927 at the age of fourteen. The results of 1927 World Championships, where Henie won in 3\u20132 decision (or 7 vs. 8 ordinal points) over the defending Olympic and World Champion [[Herma Szabo]] of [[Austria]], was controversial, as three of the five judges that gave Henie first-place ordinals were Norwegian (1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 7 points) while Szabo received first-place ordinals from an Austrian and a German Judge (1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 points). Henie went on to win first of her three [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medals the following year, became one of the [[List of Olympic medalists in figure skating by age#Youngest champions|youngest]] figure skating Olympic champions. She defended her Olympic titles in 1932 and in 1936, and her world titles annually until 1936.<ref name=sr/> She also won six consecutive European championships from 1931 to 1936. Henie's unprecedented three Olympic gold medals haven't been matched by any ladies' single skater since; neither are her achievements as ten-time consecutive World Champion. While [[Irina Slutskaya]] of Russia won her seventh European Championship in 2006 to become the most successful ladies' skater in European Championships, Henie retains record of most consecutive titles, sharing it with [[Katarina Witt]] of [[Eastern Germany]]/[[Germany]] (1983\u20131988).\n\nTowards the end of her career, she began to be strongly challenged by younger skaters including [[Cecilia Colledge]], [[Megan Taylor]], and [[Hedy Stenuf]]. However, she held off these competitors and went on to win her third Olympic title at the [[1936 Winter Olympics]], albeit in very controversial circumstances with Cecilia Colledge finishing a very close second. Indeed, after the school figures section at the 1936 Olympic competition, Colledge and Henie were virtually neck and neck with Colledge trailing by just a few points. As Sandra Stevenson recounted in her article in ''[[The Independent]]'' of 21 April 2008, \"the closeness [of the competition] infuriated Henie, who, when the result for that section was posted on a wall in the competitors' lounge, swiped the piece of paper and tore it into little pieces. The draw for the free skating [then] came under suspicion after Henie landed the plum position of skating last, while Colledge had to perform second of the 26 competitors. The early start was seen as a disadvantage, with the audience not yet whipped into a clapping frenzy and the judges known to become freer with their higher marks as the event proceeded. Years later, a fairer, staggered draw was adopted to counteract this situation\".\n\nDuring her competitive career, Henie traveled widely and worked with a variety of foreign coaches. At home in Oslo, she trained at [[Frogner|Frogner Stadium]], where her coaches included Hj\u00f8rdis Olsen and Oscar Holte. During the latter part of her competitive career she was coached primarily by the American Howard Nicholson in [[London]]. In addition to traveling to train and compete, she was much in demand as a performer at figure skating exhibitions in both Europe and North America. Henie became so popular with the public that police had to be called out for crowd control on her appearances in various disparate cities such as [[Prague]] and [[New York City]]. It was an open secret that, in spite of the strict [[amateur sports|amateurism]] requirements of the time, Wilhelm Henie demanded \"expense money\" for his daughter's skating appearances. Both of Henie's parents had given up their own pursuits in Norway\u2014leaving Leif to run the fur business\u2014in order to accompany Sonja on her travels and act as her managers.\n\nHenie is credited with being the first figure skater to adopt the short skirt costume in figure skating, wear white boots,<ref name=\"Jacobs\">{{cite news |last1=Jacobs |first1=Laura |title=Sonja Henie's Ice Age |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/02/sonja-henie-ice-skating-queen |accessdate=3 September 2018 |work=Vanity Fair |date=11 February 2014}}</ref> and make use of dance [[choreography]]. Her innovative skating techniques and glamorous demeanor transformed the sport permanently and confirmed its acceptance as a legitimate sport in the Winter Olympics.<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/siforwomen/top_100/4/ ''100 Greatest Female Athletes''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911201834/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/siforwomen/top_100/4/ |date=11 September 2006 }} (''Sports Illustrated'')</ref>\n\n===Professional and film career===\n[[File:Sonja Henie on Time Magazine 1939.jpg|right|thumb|Sonja Henie appeared on the cover of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] on July 17, 1939.]]\n\nAfter the 1936 [[World Figure Skating Championships]], Henie gave up her amateur status and took up a career as a professional performer in acting and live shows.<ref name=sr/> While still a girl, Henie had decided that she wanted to move to [[California]] and become a movie star when her competitive days were over, without considering that her thick accent might hinder her acting ambitions.\n\nIn 1936, following a successful ice show in [[Los Angeles]] orchestrated by her father to launch her film career, Hollywood studio chief [[Darryl Zanuck]] signed her to a long term contract at [[Twentieth Century Fox]], which made her one of the highest-paid actresses of the time. After the success of her first film, ''[[One in a Million (1936 film)|One in a Million]]'' (1936), Henie's position was assured and she became increasingly demanding in her business dealings with Zanuck. Henie also insisted on having total control of the skating numbers in her films such as ''[[Second Fiddle (1939 film)|Second Fiddle]]'' (1939).\n\nHenie tried to break the musical comedy mould with the anti-Nazi film ''[[Everything Happens at Night]]'' (1939) and ''[[It's a Pleasure (film)|It's a Pleasure]]'' (1945), a skating variation of the often-told ''[[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' tale about alcoholic-star-in-decline-helps-newcomer-up. It was her only film shot in [[Technicolor]], but it was not as huge at the box office as her other films and also proved her limitations as a dramatic actress in her one only dramatic film.\n\nWhen Zanuck realized her limits in the pseudo-dramatic vein, he cast her in more musical comedies; ''[[Sun Valley Serenade]]'' (1941) with [[Glenn Miller]], [[John Payne (actor)|John Payne]], [[The Nicholas Brothers]], and hit songs such as \"[[In the Mood]]\", \"[[Chattanooga Choo Choo]]\", \"[[It Happened in Sun Valley]]\", and \"[[I Know Why (And So Do You)]]\", followed by ''[[Iceland (film)|Iceland]]'' (1942) with [[Jack Oakie]], Payne, and the hit song \"[[There Will Never Be Another You]]\", and finally ''[[Wintertime (film)|Wintertime]]'' (1943) with [[Cesar Romero]], [[Carole Landis]], [[Cornel Wilde]], and Oakie. Sonja had by now developed a comedy flair and these films were all among the top box-office hits for [[20th Century-Fox]] the respective years.\n\nIn addition to her film career at Fox from 1936 to 1943, Henie formed a business arrangement with [[Arthur Wirtz]], who produced her touring ice shows under the name of \"Hollywood Ice Revue\". Wirtz also acted as Henie's financial advisor. At the time, figure skating and ice shows were not yet an established form of entertainment in the United States. Henie's popularity as a film actress attracted many new fans and instituted skating shows as a popular new entertainment. Throughout the 1940s, Henie and Wirtz produced lavish musical ice skating extravaganzas at [[Rockefeller Center]]'s [[Center Theatre (New York, New York)|Center Theatre]] attracting millions of ticket buyers.\n\nAt the height of her fame, Henie brought as much as $2 million per year from her shows and touring activities. She also had numerous lucrative endorsement contracts, and deals to market skates, clothing, jewelry, dolls, and other merchandise branded with her name. These activities made her one of the wealthiest women in the world in her time.\n[[File:Sonja Henie graumans.jpg|thumb|left|Henie's handprint/signature in front of the [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]]]]\nHenie broke off her arrangement with Wirtz in 1950 and for the next three seasons produced her own tours under the name \"Sonja Henie Ice Revue\". It was an ill-advised decision to set herself up in competition with Wirtz, whose shows now featured the new Olympic champion [[Barbara Ann Scott]]. Since Wirtz controlled the best arenas and dates, Henie was left playing smaller venues and markets already saturated by other touring ice shows such as [[Ice Capades]]. The collapse of a section of bleachers during a show in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], in 1952 compounded the tour's legal and financial woes.\n\nIn 1953, Henie formed a new partnership with [[Morris Chalfen]] to appear in his European ''[[Holiday On Ice]]'' tour, which proved to be a great success. She produced her own show at New York's [[Roxy Theatre (New York City)|Roxy Theatre]] in January 1956.<ref>Bosley Crowther, [https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F20A1FF83459157B93C0A8178AD85F428585F9 \"Screen: 'The Lieutenant Wore Skirts\"]. ''The New York Times'', 12 January 1956.</ref> However, a subsequent South American tour in 1956 was a disaster. Henie was drinking heavily at that time and could no longer keep up with the demands of touring, and this marked her retirement from skating. She did try to make a film series at her own expense; a series that would serve as a travelogue to several cities. Paris and London were mentioned, but only ''[[Hello London]]'' (1958) was made with her own backing, co-starring [[Michael Wilding (actor)|Michael Wilding]] and special guest star [[Stanley Holloway]]. While her ice show numbers were still worth watching, the film received few distributors and poor reviews, ending her film career. \n\nHer autobiography ''Mitt livs eventyr'', was published in 1938 which was translated and released as ''Wings on My Feet'' in 1940, and which was republished in a revised edition in 1954. At the time of her death, Henie was planning a comeback for a television special that would have aired in January 1970. She was to have danced to \"[[Lara's Theme]]\" from ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]''.\n\n===Nazi controversy===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-09482, Sonja Henie.jpg|thumb|Henie in Berlin, 1930]]\nHenie's connections with [[Adolf Hitler]] and other high-ranking [[Nazi]] officials made her the subject of controversy before, during, and after [[World War II]]. During her amateur skating career, she performed often in [[Germany]] and was a favorite of German audiences and of Hitler personally. As a wealthy celebrity, she moved in the same social circles as royalty and heads of state and made Hitler's acquaintance as a matter of course. During the shooting of ''[[Second Fiddle (1939 film)|Second Fiddle]]'' (1939), she greeted the then Crown-Prince couple of Norway [[Olav V of Norway|Olav]] and [[Princess M\u00e4rtha of Sweden|M\u00e4rtha]] during their US tour. Through the years, her shows and later art exhibitions drew the attention of such people as [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon]] and [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden]] and she met with them.\n[[File:Sonja Henie & Adolf Hitler 1936.jpg|thumb|left|Henie with Hitler in 1936]]\nControversy appeared first when Henie greeted Hitler with a [[Nazi salute]] at the 1936 Winter Olympics in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]] and after the Games she accepted an invitation to lunch with Hitler at his resort home in nearby [[Berchtesgaden]], where Hitler presented Henie with an autographed photo with a lengthy inscription. She was strongly denounced in the Norwegian press for this. In her revised 1954 biography,<ref group=note>Page 39</ref> she states that no Norwegian judge was in the panel for the 1936 Olympics\u2014as she was entitled to as a Norwegian. She therefore made the most of it and won her third Olympic medal. When she\u2014as a gold medal winner\u2014passed Hitler's tribune with silver medalist [[Cecilia Colledge]] and bronze medalist [[Vivi-Anne Hult\u00e9n]], neither she nor the others honored Hitler with the Nazi salute. The [[1936 European Figure Skating Championships]] also took place in Berlin and neither Henie, Colledge, nor [[Megan Taylor]] paid obeisance to Hitler.{{cn|date=December 2019}} \n\nIn her film ''[[Everything Happens at Night]]'' (1939), [[Ray Milland]] and [[Robert Cummings]] star as rival reporters hot on the trail of Hugo Norden (Maurice Moscovich). Norden, a Nobel Prize winner, was supposedly murdered by the Gestapo, but is rumored to be in hiding and writing anonymous dispatches advocating world peace. When Geoffrey and Ken track Norden to a small village in the Swiss Alps, they soon find themselves competing over the affections of beautiful Louise (Henie), who has a deeper connection to the missing Nobel laureate than the reporters realize. When Geoffrey and Ken get so distracted by romance that they begin to neglect their assignments, it almost leads to disaster as the Gestapo sets out to silence Norden once and for all. Released on 22 December 1939, it was banned in Nazi Germany.\n\nThrough her 1940 marriage to [[Dan Topping]] she had become an American citizen. As such, she was not eligible to speak Norway's cause and with producer [[Alexander Korda]], who was set to produce the propaganda film [[That Hamilton Woman]], could have faced deportation. The Senate Subcommittee (Senate Foreign Relations) dealt with such matters. After the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|bombing of Pearl Harbor]], when America was no longer neutral, Henie pulled in uniform and visited and gave money to [[Little Norway]]. All Norwegians got free tickets to her shows during the war and she paid and held parties for them.\n\nDuring the [[occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany]], German troops saw Hitler's autographed photo prominently displayed at the piano in the Henie family home in [[Land\u00f8ya]], [[Asker]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Sonja Henie|url=http://www.geni.com/people/Sonja-Henie/6000000015540940745|accessdate=27 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702042510/http://www.geni.com/people/Sonja-Henie/6000000015540940745|archive-date=2 July 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> As a result, none of Henie's properties in Norway were confiscated or damaged by the Germans. Henie became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the [[United States]] in 1940. Like many Hollywood stars, she supported the U.S. war effort through [[USO]] and similar activities. After the Japanese attack, she invited the boys from [[Little Norway]] to her ice shows, gave the mechanics a plane as well a substantial sum of money to their educational fund. But her first rejection before the US entered the war was never to be forgotten. For this, she was condemned by many Norwegians and Norwegian-Americans. After the war, Henie was mindful that many of her countrymen considered her to be a [[quisling]]. However, she made a triumphant return to Norway with the [[Holiday on Ice]] tour in 1953 and 1955. The [[Norwegian Royal Family]] attended both events and indeed attended her funeral in 1969. The Royal Family were very mindful of whom they supported after the war and Norwegians looked to them as role models in that respect.\n\n===Personal life===\n{{external media\n| image1 = [http://unitproj.library.ucla.edu/dlib/lat/display.cfm?ms=uclalat_1429_b519_222464 '''Sonja Henie'''] with her art collection in Los Angeles, 1964.

''RCGS Resolute'', which had left Buenos Aires on 5 March,<ref name=\"chronicleherald17march\" /> had been adrift in the open sea for a day while carrying out routine maintenance on the starboard main engine before reaching her next destination, [[Willemstad]] in [[Cura\u00e7ao]].

While the master was in contact with the company's head office and [[designated person ashore]] (DPA), warning shots were fired from ''Naiguat\u00e1'' and, shortly afterwards, the Venezuelan patrol boat purposely rammed the cruise ship's starboard bow. During an apparent attempt to change the heading of ''RCGS Resolute'' towards Venezuelan territorial waters, ''Naiguat\u00e1'' came in contact with the cruise ship's [[ice class|ice-strengthened]] [[bulbous bow]], started to take water, and eventually sank. ''RCGS Resolute'', which had a crew of 32 onboard but was not carrying passengers, survived the encounter with superficial damage and remained on site for over an hour to provide assistance until being allowed to continue towards Willemstad by Joint [[Rescue Coordination Centre]] (JRCC) Cura\u00e7ao.<ref name=\"ccs_statement\">{{cite  web|url=https://www.columbia-cs.com/statement-on-rcgs-resolute-incident/|title=Statement on RCGS RESOLUTE incident|publisher=Columbia Cruise Services|date=1 April 2020|accessdate=6 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== Portuguese investigation ====\n{{commonscat|IMO 9000168|RCGS Resolute}}\nOn 6 April, the Office for the Investigation of Maritime Accidents and the Aeronautical Meteorology Authority (Gabinete de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o de Acidentes Mar\u00edtimos e da Autoridade para a Meteorologia Aeron\u00e1utica; GAMA) of Portugal released a technical investigation report on the incident involving the Portuguese-flagged cruise ship.<ref name=\"gamareport\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gama.mm.gov.pt/images/Relatorios_Tecnicos/2020-065_RCGS_RESOLUTE.pdf|title=Relat\u00f3rio de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o T\u00e9cnica / Investigation report|language=Portuguese|publisher=Gabinete de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o de Acidentes Mar\u00edtimos e da Autoridade para a Meteorologia Aeron\u00e1utica (GAMA)|date=6 April 2020|accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the report, ''RCGS Resolute'' had departed Buenos Aires on 5 March and sailed to the [[Caribbean Sea]] along the South American coastline. On 28 March, the vessel had stopped in the open sea to allow the crew to carry out maintenance work in the engine room. After drifting closer to the Venezuelan coast on the following day, ''RCGS Resolute'' had resumed sailing west for about 90 minutes until the ship had passed La Tortuga Island and then continued adrift to a westerly direction while the starboard main engine [[turbocharger]] was being serviced.<ref name=\"gamareport\" />\n\nOn the night of 30 March, ''RCGS Resolute'' was contacted by the Venezuelan Coast Guard patrol boat ''Naiguat\u00e1'' at around quarter past midnight. After a brief questioning over VHF, the cruise ship was ordered to follow the Venezuelan vessel to Puerto Moreno on the basis that the Portuguese-flagged vessel was violating Venezuelan territorial waters. After consulting with the company designated person ashore (DPA), ''RCGS Resolute'' announced that the vessel would start engines and resume voyage to Cura\u00e7ao.<ref name=\"gamareport\" />\n\nAt around 01:05 [[Time in Venezuela|local time]], ''Naiguat\u00e1'' approached ''RCGS Resolute'' from the starboard quarter and, after suddenly changing course to port, collided with the bow of the cruise ship at a relative angle of about 45 degrees between the vessels. Few minutes after the initial impact, ''RCGS Resolute''{{'}}s master ordered the port side [[controllable pitch propeller]] first to zero pitch and then to astern thrust in order to separate the two vessels. The company DPA instructed the cruise ship to remain on site and contact the local Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC). At 01:38, about half an hour after the collision, ''Naiguat\u00e1''{{'}}s [[AIS-SART]] was activated but ''RCGS Resolute'' was unable to establish contact with the sinking Venezuelan vessel over VHF and instead reached out to JRCC Cura\u00e7ao. About one hour later, the Venezuelan crew was seen preparing [[liferaft]]s for launching.

Although the collision may have not been intentional ramming, the conclusion was nonetheless that the incident that led to the sinking of ''Naiguat\u00e1'' was a deliberate act initiated by the Venezuelan Navy rather than an accidental occurrence.<ref name=\"gamareport\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Hapag-Lloyd Cruises}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:RCGS Resolute}}\n[[Category:Cruise ships]]\n[[Category:1991 ships]]\n[[Category:Ships built in Rauma, Finland]]\n[[Category:Maritime incidents in 2020]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Cruise ship}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{|{{Infobox ship begin|display title=''RCGS Resolute''}}\n{{Infobox ship image\n| Ship image = RCGS Resolute.jpg\n| Ship caption = ''RCGS Resolute'' in [[Aberdeen]] in June 2019\n}}\n{{Infobox ship career\n| Hide header = \n| Ship name = *''Society Adventurer'' (1991\u20131993)\n*''Hanseatic'' (1993\u20132018)\n*''RCGS Resolute'' (2018\u2013present)\n| Ship owner = * [[Discoverer Reederei]] (planned)<ref name=\"id\" />\n* Society Adventurer Shipping Company (1991\u20131993)<ref name=\"id\" />\n* Bunnys Adventure & Cruise Shipping Co Ltd (1993\u2013present)<ref name=\"seaweb\" />\n| Ship operator = * [[Hanseatic Tours]] (1993\u20131997)\n* [[Hapag-Lloyd Cruises]] (1997\u20132018)\n* [[One Ocean Expeditions]] (2018\u20132019)<ref name=\"seaweb\" />\n| Ship registry = * [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], {{BAH}} (1991\u20132018)\n* [[Madeira, Portugal|Madeira]], {{POR}} (2018\u2013present)<ref name=\"seaweb\" />\n| Ship route = \n| Ship ordered = 22 December 1989<ref name=\"dnv\" />\n| Ship builder = [[Rauma Yards]] ([[Rauma, Finland|Rauma]], [[Finland]])<ref name=\"id\">{{cite|last1=Id|first1=Kalle|last2=Peter|first2=Bruce|title=Innovation and Specialisation \u2014 A History of Shipbuilding in Finland|publisher=Nautilus|year=2017|ISBN=9788790924683|page=}}</ref>\n| Ship original cost = US$75 million<ref name=\"id\" />\n| Ship yard number =306<ref name=\"dnv\" />\n| Ship laid down = 3 September 1990<ref name=\"dnv\" />\n| Ship launched = 5 January 1991<ref name=\"dnv\" />\n| Ship completed = 7 June 1991<ref name=\"dnv\" />\n| Ship sponsor=Ursel Klein<ref name=\"maritimereporter\">{{cite web|url=https://magazines.marinelink.com/Magazines/MaritimeReporter/199102/content/launches-luxury-cruise-200306|title=Rauma Yards Launches Luxury Cruise Ship|work=Maritime Reporter and Engineering News|date=February 1991|accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n| Ship christened = \n| Ship acquired = \n| Ship maiden voyage = 27 March 1993<ref name=\"fof\" />\n| Ship in service = \n| Ship out of service = \n|Ship identification=* [[Maritime call sign|Call sign]]: CQAL6\n* {{IMO Number|9000168}}\n* {{MMSI|255806208}}<ref name=\"equasis\">{{csr|register=E|id=9000168|shipname=RCGS Resolute|accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n* {{ship register|DNV|G99209}}<ref name=\"dnv\">{{csr|register=DNV|id=G99209|shipname=RCGS Resolute|accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n| Ship status = In service\n| Ship notes = \n}}\n{{Infobox ship characteristics\n| Hide header = \n| Header caption = <ref name=\"dnv\" /><ref name=\"Hapag\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurolloyd.com/Hapag-Lloyd/HANSEATIC.pdf|title=MS ''Hanseatic'' Ship details|publisher=Hapag-Lloyd|accessdate=28 February 2009|format=PDF}}</ref>\n| Ship type = [[Cruise ship]]\n| Ship tonnage =* {{GT|8,445}}\n* {{NetT|2,573}}\n* {{DWT|1,177}}\n| Ship displacement = 5,892{{nbsp}}tonnes<ref name=\"seaweb\" />\n| Ship length = {{convert|124.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}}\n| Ship beam = {{convert|18.00|m|ftin|abbr=on}}\n| Ship height = \n| Ship draught = \n| Ship draft = {{convert|4.9|m|ftin|abbr=on}}\n| Ship depth = {{convert|7|m|ftin|abbr=on}}\n| Ship decks = 6\n| Ship deck clearance = \n| Ship ramps = \n| Ship ice class = [[DNV GL]] E4\n| Ship power = 2{{nbsp}}&times;{{nbsp}}[[MaK]] 8M453C (2{{nbsp}}&times;{{nbsp}}2,940{{nbsp}}kW)<ref name=\"seaweb\">{{csr|register=SEAWEB|id=9000168|shipname=RCGS Resolute|accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n| Ship propulsion = Two shafts; [[controllable pitch propeller]]s\n| Ship speed = {{convert|16|kn}}\n| Ship range= {{convert|8600|nmi}}\n| Ship capacity = 184 passengers in 88 cabins and four suites\n| Ship crew = 125\n| Ship notes = \n}}\n|}\n'''''RCGS Resolute''''' is a [[star (classification)|five-star]] [[ice class|ice-strengthened]] expedition [[cruise ship]] built in 1991 by [[Rauma Yards]] in Finland.

During an apparent attempt to change the heading of ''RCGS Resolute'' towards Venezuelan territorial waters, ''Naiguat\u00e1'' came in contact with the cruise ship's [[ice class|ice-strengthened]] [[bulbous bow]], started to take water, and eventually sank. ''RCGS Resolute'', which had a crew of 32 onboard but was not carrying passengers, survived the encounter with superficial damage and remained on site for over an hour to provide assistance until being allowed to continue towards Willemstad by Joint [[Rescue Coordination Centre]] (JRCC) Cura\u00e7ao.<ref name=\"ccs_statement\">{{cite  web|url=https://www.columbia-cs.com/statement-on-rcgs-resolute-incident/|title=Statement on RCGS RESOLUTE incident|publisher=Columbia Cruise Services|date=1 April 2020|accessdate=6 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== Portuguese investigation ====\n{{commonscat|IMO 9000168|RCGS Resolute}}\nOn 6 April, the Office for the Investigation of Maritime Accidents and the Aeronautical Meteorology Authority (Gabinete de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o de Acidentes Mar\u00edtimos e da Autoridade para a Meteorologia Aeron\u00e1utica; GAMA) of Portugal released a technical investigation report on the incident involving the Portuguese-flagged cruise ship.<ref name=\"gamareport\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gama.mm.gov.pt/images/Relatorios_Tecnicos/2020-065_RCGS_RESOLUTE.pdf|title=Relat\u00f3rio de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o T\u00e9cnica / Investigation report|language=Portuguese|publisher=Gabinete de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o de Acidentes Mar\u00edtimos e da Autoridade para a Meteorologia Aeron\u00e1utica (GAMA)|date=6 April 2020|accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the report, ''RCGS Resolute'' had departed Buenos Aires on 5 March and sailed to the [[Caribbean Sea]] along the South American coastline. On 28 March, the vessel had stopped in the open sea to allow the crew to carry out maintenance work in the engine room. After drifting closer to the Venezuelan coast on the following day, ''RCGS Resolute'' had resumed sailing west for about 90 minutes until the ship had passed La Tortuga Island and then continued adrift to a westerly direction while the starboard main engine [[turbocharger]] was being serviced.<ref name=\"gamareport\" />\n\nOn the night of 30 March, ''RCGS Resolute'' was contacted by the Venezuelan Coast Guard patrol boat ''Naiguat\u00e1'' at around quarter past midnight. After a brief questioning over VHF, the cruise ship was ordered to follow the Venezuelan vessel to Puerto Moreno on the basis that the Portuguese-flagged vessel was violating Venezuelan territorial waters. After consulting with the company designated person ashore (DPA), ''RCGS Resolute'' announced that the vessel would start engines and resume voyage to Cura\u00e7ao.<ref name=\"gamareport\" />\n\nAt around 01:05 [[Time in Venezuela|local time]], ''Naiguat\u00e1'' approached ''RCGS Resolute'' from the starboard quarter and, after suddenly changing course to port, collided with the bow of the cruise ship at a relative angle of about 45 degrees between the vessels. Few minutes after the initial impact, ''RCGS Resolute''{{'}}s master ordered the port side [[controllable pitch propeller]] first to zero pitch and then to astern thrust in order to separate the two vessels. The company DPA instructed the cruise ship to remain on site and contact the local Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC). At 01:38, about half an hour after the collision, ''Naiguat\u00e1''{{'}}s [[AIS-SART]] was activated but ''RCGS Resolute'' was unable to establish contact with the sinking Venezuelan vessel over VHF and instead reached out to JRCC Cura\u00e7ao. About one hour later, the Venezuelan crew was seen preparing [[liferaft]]s for launching. At 02:43, JRCC Cura\u00e7ao relayed a statement from the Venezuelan authority responsible for the region, MRCC La Guairaa, that ''RCGS Resolute''{{'}}s assistance was no longer needed on site and instructed the cruise ship to proceed to Willemstad in order to avoid problems with the Venezuelan Navy.<ref name=\"gamareport\" />\n\nAlthough the Portuguese authorities have not obtained statements from Venezuela, the report discusses the possibility that the unexpected change in ''Naiguat\u00e1''{{'}}s heading just before the collision, as reported by ''RCGS Resolute'', may have been caused by a suction effect between the vessels as the faster patrol boat passed the bow of the cruise ship. Although the collision may have not been intentional ramming, the conclusion was nonetheless that the incident that led to the sinking of ''Naiguat\u00e1'' was a deliberate act initiated by the Venezuelan Navy rather than an accidental occurrence.<ref name=\"gamareport\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Hapag-Lloyd Cruises}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:RCGS Resolute}}\n[[Category:Cruise ships]]\n[[Category:1991 ships]]\n[[Category:Ships built in Rauma, Finland]]\n[[Category:Maritime incidents in 2020]]\n", "name_user": "Tupsumato", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eInitial reports", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCGS_Resolute"}

Do not add any unnecessary details to plot. -->\nDominick \"Dom\" Cobb and Arthur are \"extractors\": they perform [[corporate espionage]] using experimental military technology to infiltrate the [[Unconscious mind|subconscious]] of their targets and extract valuable information through a [[shared dreaming|shared]] [[Dream world (plot device)|dream world]]. Their latest target, Japanese businessman Saito, reveals that he arranged their mission himself to test Cobb for a seemingly impossible job: implanting an idea in a person's subconscious, or \"inception\". To break up the [[energy industry|energy]] [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] of ailing competitor Maurice Fischer, Saito wants Cobb to convince Fischer's son and heir, Robert, to dissolve his father's company. In return, Saito promises to use his influence once the job is done to clear Cobb's apparent criminal status, which prevents him from returning home to his children.\n\nThough Arthur believes the task is impossible, Cobb insists that it can be done. Cobb accepts the offer and assembles his team: Eames, a conman and identity forger; Yusuf, a chemist who concocts a powerful [[sedative]] for a stable \"[[false awakening|dream within a dream]]\" strategy; and Ariadne, an architecture student tasked with designing the [[labyrinth]] of the dream landscapes, recruited with the help of Cobb's father-in-law, Professor Stephen Miles. While dream-sharing with Cobb, Ariadne learns his subconscious houses an invasive projection of his late wife Mal.\n\nAfter Maurice dies in [[Sydney]], Robert Fischer accompanies the body on a ten-hour flight back to Los Angeles. The team (including Saito, who wants to verify their success) uses this as an opportunity to sedate and take Fischer into a shared dream. At each dream level, the person generating the dream stays behind to set up a \"[[Hypnic jerk|kick]]\" that will be used to awaken the other sleeping team members from the deeper dream level; to be successful, these kicks must occur simultaneously at each dream level, a fact complicated due to the nature of time, which flows much faster in each successive level. They use \"[[Non, je ne regrette rien]]\" as an auditory cue to help coordinate the kicks. The first level is Yusuf's dream of a rainy Los Angeles. \n\nThe team abducts Fischer, but they are attacked by armed projections from his subconscious, which has been specifically trained to defend against such intruders. The team takes Robert and a wounded Saito to a warehouse, where Cobb reveals that while dying in the dream would normally wake Saito up, the powerful sedatives needed to stabilize the multi-level dream will instead send a dying dreamer into \"[[Limbo#Cultural references|limbo]]\": a world of infinite subconscious from which escape is extremely difficult, if not impossible, and in which a dreamer risks forgetting they are in a dream. Despite these setbacks, the team continues with the mission.\n\nEames impersonates Robert's godfather, Peter Browning, to suggest Robert reconsider his father's will. Yusuf drives them around in a van as the rest are sedated into the second level, a hotel dreamed by Arthur. Cobb persuades Robert that he has been kidnapped by Browning, and that Cobb is his subconscious protector. Cobb persuades Robert to go down another level to explore Browning's subconscious (in reality, it is a ruse to enter Robert's subconscious). The third level is a fortified hospital on a snowy mountain dreamed by Eames. The team has to infiltrate it and hold off the guards as Saito takes Robert into the equivalent of his subconscious. Yusuf, under pursuit by Robert's projections in the first level, deliberately drives off a bridge, thus initiating his kick too soon. This causes an avalanche in Eames' level, and removes the gravity of Arthur's level, thus forcing Arthur to improvise a new kick synchronized with the van hitting the water. Mal's projection emerges in Eames' level and kills Robert; Cobb kills Mal, and Saito succumbs to his wounds. Cobb and Ariadne enter Limbo to rescue Robert and Saito, while Eames sets up a kick by rigging the hospital with explosives.\n\nCobb reveals to Ariadne that he and Mal went to limbo while experimenting with the dream-sharing technology. Sedated for five hours of real time, they spent fifty years in a dream constructing a world from their shared memories. When Mal refused to return to reality, Cobb used a rudimentary form of inception by reactivating her totem (an object that dreamers use to distinguish their dreams from reality), and reminding her subconscious that their world was not real. However, after waking up, the inception had taken root and Mal still believed that she was dreaming. In an attempt to \"wake up\" for real, she committed suicide and framed Cobb for her death to force him to do the same. Facing a murder charge, Cobb fled the U.S., leaving his children in the care of his father-in-law.\n\nThrough his confession, Cobb makes peace with his guilt over Mal's death. Ariadne kills Mal's projection and wakes Robert up with a kick. Revived at the fortified hospital, he enters a safe room to discover and accept the planted idea: a projection of his dying father telling him to be his own man. While Cobb remains in limbo to search for Saito, the other team members ride the synchronized kicks back to reality. Cobb eventually finds an aged Saito in limbo and reminds him of their agreement. The dreamers all awake on the plane and Saito makes a phone call.\n\nUpon arrival at Los Angeles Airport, Cobb passes the U.S. immigration checkpoint and Professor Miles accompanies him to his home. Using Mal's old totem\u2014a [[spinning top]] that spins indefinitely in a dream world but falls over in reality\u2014Cobb conducts a test to prove that he is indeed in the real world, but he does not observe its result and instead joins his children in the garden.\n<!-- DO NOT ADD ANY DETAIL ABOUT THE ENDING HERE.

The idea was inspired by a technique used in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968). Nolan said, \"I was interested in taking those ideas, techniques, and philosophies and applying them to an action scenario\".<ref name=\"Heuring2\">Heuring, July 2010, p. 32.</ref> The filmmakers originally planned to make the hallway only 40&nbsp;ft (12&nbsp;m) long, but as the action sequence became more elaborate, the hallway's length was increased to 100&nbsp;ft (30&nbsp;m).

Capturing the actors suspended within the van in slow motion took a whole day to film. \n\nOnce the van landed in the water, the challenge for the actors was to avoid panic. \"And when they ask you to act, it's a bit of an ask,\" explained Cillian Murphy.<ref name=\"Ditzian\" /> The actors had to be underwater for four to five minutes while drawing air from [[Diving cylinder|scuba tanks]]; underwater [[buddy breathing]] is shown in this sequence.<ref name=\"Ditzian\" /> \n\nCobb's house was in Pasadena.

N Hope St. in Los Angeles was the primary filming location for 'limbo,' with green screen and CGI being used to create the dream landscape.\n\nThe final phase of principal photography took place in [[Alberta]] in late November 2009.

Franklin had artists build concepts while Nolan expressed his ideal vision: \"Something glacial, with clear modernist architecture, but with chunks of it breaking off into the sea like icebergs\".<ref name=\"trussell\" /> Franklin and his team ended up with \"something that looked like an iceberg version of [[Gotham City]] with water running through it.\"<ref name=\"trussell\" /> They created a basic model of a glacier and then designers created a program that added elements like roads, intersections and ravines until they had a complex, yet organic-looking, cityscape. For the Paris-folding sequence, Franklin had artists producing concept sketches and then they created rough computer animations to give them an idea of what the sequence looked like while in motion. Later during principal photography, Nolan was able to direct Leonardo DiCaprio and Ellen Page based on this rough computer animation that Franklin had created. ''Inception'' had nearly 500 visual effects shots (in comparison, ''[[Batman Begins]]'' had approximately 620), which is relatively few in comparison to contemporary effects-heavy films, which can have as many as 2,000 visual effects shots.<ref name=\"trussell\" />\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Inception: Music from the Motion Picture}}\n\nThe score for ''Inception'' was written by [[Hans Zimmer]],<ref name=\"CinemaRewind\" /> who described his work as \"a very electronic,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/inception-score-hans-zimmers-mikee-65200 |title=Hans Zimmer's 'Inception' Score Will Release On July 13th |publisher=ScreenRant.com |access-date=July 1, 2010 |date=June 18, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625130549/http://screenrant.com/inception-score-hans-zimmers-mikee-65200/ |archivedate=June 25, 2010}}</ref> dense score\",<ref name=\"Cassidy\"/> filled with \"nostalgia and sadness\" to match Cobb's feelings throughout the film.<ref name=\"Martens\"/> The music was written simultaneously to filming,<ref name=\"Cassidy\">{{cite news |last=Cassidy |first=Kevin |title=Q&A: Composer Hans Zimmer |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=July 13, 2010 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/qampa-composer-hans-zimmer-25455|accessdate=July 14, 2010}}</ref> and features a guitar sound reminiscent of [[Ennio Morricone]], played by [[Johnny Marr]], former guitarist of [[The Smiths]].\n[[\u00c9dith Piaf]]'s \"[[Non, je ne regrette rien]]\" (\"No, I Regret Nothing\") appears throughout the film, used to accurately time the dreams, and Zimmer reworked pieces of the song into cues of the score.<ref name=\"Martens\">{{cite news |last=Martens |first=Todd |title=Hans Zimmer and Johnny Marr talk about the sad romance of 'Inception' |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=July 20, 2010 |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2010/07/inception-christopher-nolan-the-smiths-johnny-marr-hans-zimmer-and-johnny-marr-on-the-sound-of-inception-its-about-sadness.html |access-date=July 20, 2010}}</ref>\n[[Inception: Music from the Motion Picture|A soundtrack album]] was released on July 11, 2010 by [[Reprise Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inceptionscore.com/|title=Inception: Music from the Motion Picture official website|publisher=Warner Bros.|access-date=July 3, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616131408/http://www.inceptionscore.com/|archive-date=June 16, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The majority of the score was also included in high resolution [[5.1 surround sound]] on the second disc of the 2 disc Blu-ray release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Inception-Blu-ray/14492/#Review|title=Inception Blu-ray review from Blu-ray.com|access-date=August 8, 2012}}</ref> Hans Zimmer's music was nominated for an Academy Award in the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] category in 2011, losing to [[Trent Reznor]] and [[Atticus Ross]] of ''[[The Social Network]]''.<ref name=oscars/>\n\n==Themes==\n\n===Reality and dreams===\n[[File:Impossible staircase.svg|right|thumb|[[Penrose stairs]] are incorporated into the film as an example of the [[impossible object]]s that can be created in [[lucid dream]] worlds.|alt=A staircase in a square format.

However, \"he did get many aspects right,\" she said, citing the scene in which a sleeping Cobb is shoved into a full bath, and in the dream world water gushes into the windows of the building, waking him up. \"That's very much how real stimuli get incorporated, and you very often wake up right after that intrusion\".<ref name=\"Breznican\">{{Cite news|last=Breznican|first=Anthony|title=With ''Inception'', Chris Nolan's head games continue|work=[[USA Today]]|date=July 15, 2010|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-07-15-inception15_CV_N.htm|accessdate=July 15, 2010}}</ref>\n\nNolan himself said, \"I tried to work that idea of manipulation and management of a [[Lucid dream|conscious dream]] being a skill that these people have.

Writing in ''Wired'', Jonah Lehrer supported this interpretation and presented neurological evidence that brain activity is strikingly similar during film-watching and sleeping. In both, the [[visual cortex]] is highly active and the [[prefrontal cortex]], which deals with logic, deliberate analysis, and self-awareness, is quiet.<ref name='Lehrer'>[[Jonah Lehrer|Lehrer, J.]] [https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/07/the-neuroscience-of-inception/ The Neuroscience of Inception], ''Wired'', July 26, 2010.

This demand of production parallel to consumption of the images, on the part of the audience is analogous to dreaming itself. As in the film's story, in a cinema one enters into the space of another's dream, in this case Nolan's, as with any work of art, one's reading of it is ultimately influenced by one's own subjective desires and subconscious.<ref name='Paul'/> At Bir-Hakeim bridge in Paris, Ariadne creates an illusion of infinity by adding [[Infinity mirror|facing mirrors]] underneath its struts, Stephanie Dreyfus in ''la Croix'' asked \"Is this not a strong, beautiful metaphor for the cinema and its power of illusion?\"<ref>Dreyfus, St\u00e9phanie [http://www.la-croix.com/Culture-Loisirs/Culture/Actualite/Inception-allegorie-onirique-sur-l-illusion-cinematographique-_NG_-2010-07-20-554535 \"Inception\", all\u00e9gorie onirique sur l'illusion cin\u00e9matographique] ''[[La Croix]]'', July 20, 2010.

As the film's main antagonist, she is a frequent, malevolent presence in his dreams. Dom is unable to control these projections of her, challenging his abilities as an extractor.<ref name=\"threecircle\" /> Nolan described Mal as \"the essence of the femme fatale\",<ref name=\"Production Notes 2010, p. 9\">{{cite web|url=http://wwws.warnerbros.co.uk/inception/mainsite/pdf/INCEPTION_PK_Notes__Bios_6-18.pdf|title=Production Notes 2010, p. 9|publisher=}}</ref> the key ''noir'' reference in the film.

Do not add any unnecessary details to plot. -->\nDominick \"Dom\" Cobb and Arthur are \"extractors\": they perform [[corporate espionage]] using experimental military technology to infiltrate the [[Unconscious mind|subconscious]] of their targets and extract valuable information through a [[shared dreaming|shared]] [[Dream world (plot device)|dream world]]. Their latest target, Japanese businessman Saito, reveals that he arranged their mission himself to test Cobb for a seemingly impossible job: implanting an idea in a person's subconscious, or \"inception\". To break up the [[energy industry|energy]] [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] of ailing competitor Maurice Fischer, Saito wants Cobb to convince Fischer's son and heir, Robert, to dissolve his father's company. In return, Saito promises to use his influence once the job is done to clear Cobb's apparent criminal status, which prevents him from returning home to his children.\n\nThough Arthur believes the task is impossible, Cobb insists that it can be done. Cobb accepts the offer and assembles his team: Eames, a conman and identity forger; Yusuf, a chemist who concocts a powerful [[sedative]] for a stable \"[[false awakening|dream within a dream]]\" strategy; and Ariadne, an architecture student tasked with designing the [[labyrinth]] of the dream landscapes, recruited with the help of Cobb's father-in-law, Professor Stephen Miles. While dream-sharing with Cobb, Ariadne learns his subconscious houses an invasive projection of his late wife Mal.\n\nAfter Maurice dies in [[Sydney]], Robert Fischer accompanies the body on a ten-hour flight back to Los Angeles. The team (including Saito, who wants to verify their success) uses this as an opportunity to sedate and take Fischer into a shared dream. At each dream level, the person generating the dream stays behind to set up a \"[[Hypnic jerk|kick]]\" that will be used to awaken the other sleeping team members from the deeper dream level; to be successful, these kicks must occur simultaneously at each dream level, a fact complicated due to the nature of time, which flows much faster in each successive level. They use \"[[Non, je ne regrette rien]]\" as an auditory cue to help coordinate the kicks. The first level is Yusuf's dream of a rainy Los Angeles. \n\nThe team abducts Fischer, but they are attacked by armed projections from his subconscious, which has been specifically trained to defend against such intruders. The team takes Robert and a wounded Saito to a warehouse, where Cobb reveals that while dying in the dream would normally wake Saito up, the powerful sedatives needed to stabilize the multi-level dream will instead send a dying dreamer into \"[[Limbo#Cultural references|limbo]]\": a world of infinite subconscious from which escape is extremely difficult, if not impossible, and in which a dreamer risks forgetting they are in a dream. Despite these setbacks, the team continues with the mission.\n\nEames impersonates Robert's godfather, Peter Browning, to suggest Robert reconsider his father's will. Yusuf drives them around in a van as the rest are sedated into the second level, a hotel dreamed by Arthur. Cobb persuades Robert that he has been kidnapped by Browning, and that Cobb is his subconscious protector. Cobb persuades Robert to go down another level to explore Browning's subconscious (in reality, it is a ruse to enter Robert's subconscious). The third level is a fortified hospital on a snowy mountain dreamed by Eames. The team has to infiltrate it and hold off the guards as Saito takes Robert into the equivalent of his subconscious. Yusuf, under pursuit by Robert's projections in the first level, deliberately drives off a bridge, thus initiating his kick too soon. This causes an avalanche in Eames' level, and removes the gravity of Arthur's level, thus forcing Arthur to improvise a new kick synchronized with the van hitting the water. Mal's projection emerges in Eames' level and kills Robert; Cobb kills Mal, and Saito succumbs to his wounds. Cobb and Ariadne enter Limbo to rescue Robert and Saito, while Eames sets up a kick by rigging the hospital with explosives.\n\nCobb reveals to Ariadne that he and Mal went to limbo while experimenting with the dream-sharing technology. Sedated for five hours of real time, they spent fifty years in a dream constructing a world from their shared memories. When Mal refused to return to reality, Cobb used a rudimentary form of inception by reactivating her totem (an object that dreamers use to distinguish their dreams from reality), and reminding her subconscious that their world was not real. However, after waking up, the inception had taken root and Mal still believed that she was dreaming. In an attempt to \"wake up\" for real, she committed suicide and framed Cobb for her death to force him to do the same. Facing a murder charge, Cobb fled the U.S., leaving his children in the care of his father-in-law.\n\nThrough his confession, Cobb makes peace with his guilt over Mal's death. Ariadne kills Mal's projection and wakes Robert up with a kick. Revived at the fortified hospital, he enters a safe room to discover and accept the planted idea: a projection of his dying father telling him to be his own man. While Cobb remains in limbo to search for Saito, the other team members ride the synchronized kicks back to reality. Cobb eventually finds an aged Saito in limbo and reminds him of their agreement. The dreamers all awake on the plane and Saito makes a phone call.\n\nUpon arrival at Los Angeles Airport, Cobb passes the U.S. immigration checkpoint and Professor Miles accompanies him to his home. Using Mal's old totem\u2014a [[spinning top]] that spins indefinitely in a dream world but falls over in reality\u2014Cobb conducts a test to prove that he is indeed in the real world, but he does not observe its result and instead joins his children in the garden.\n<!-- DO NOT ADD ANY DETAIL ABOUT THE ENDING HERE.

The idea was inspired by a technique used in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968). Nolan said, \"I was interested in taking those ideas, techniques, and philosophies and applying them to an action scenario\".<ref name=\"Heuring2\">Heuring, July 2010, p. 32.</ref> The filmmakers originally planned to make the hallway only 40&nbsp;ft (12&nbsp;m) long, but as the action sequence became more elaborate, the hallway's length was increased to 100&nbsp;ft (30&nbsp;m).

High-pressure [[nitrogen]] was used to create the effect of a series of explosions. Pfister used six high-speed cameras to capture the sequence from different angles and make sure that they got the shot. The visual effects department enhanced the sequence, adding more destruction and flying debris.

The dining room was inspired by the historic [[Nijo Castle]], built around 1603.

The filmmakers set up elaborate effects (e.g., rooftop [[water cannon]]s) to give the audience the impression that the weather was overcast and soggy.

Capturing the actors suspended within the van in slow motion took a whole day to film. \n\nOnce the van landed in the water, the challenge for the actors was to avoid panic. \"And when they ask you to act, it's a bit of an ask,\" explained Cillian Murphy.<ref name=\"Ditzian\" /> The actors had to be underwater for four to five minutes while drawing air from [[Diving cylinder|scuba tanks]]; underwater [[buddy breathing]] is shown in this sequence.<ref name=\"Ditzian\" /> \n\nCobb's house was in Pasadena. The hotel lobby was filmed at the CAA building in Century City. 'Limbo' was made on location in Los Angeles and [[Morocco]], with the beach scene filmed at [[Palos Verdes]] beach with CGI buildings. N Hope St. in Los Angeles was the primary filming location for 'limbo,' with green screen and CGI being used to create the dream landscape.\n\nThe final phase of principal photography took place in [[Alberta]] in late November 2009.

Nolan did not shoot any footage with [[IMAX]] cameras as he had with ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]''. \"We didn't feel that we were going to be able to shoot in IMAX because of the size of the cameras because this film given that it deals with a potentially surreal area, the nature of dreams and so forth, I wanted it to be as realistic as possible. Not be bound by the scale of those IMAX cameras, even though I love the format dearly\".<ref name=\"Weintraub\" /> In addition Nolan and Pfister tested using [[Showscan]] and [[List of film formats|Super Dimension 70]] as potential large format [[high frame rate]] camera systems to use for the film, but ultimately decided against either format.<ref name=\"Heuring\" /> Sequences in slow motion were filmed on a Photo-Sonics 35mm camera at speeds of up to 1000 frames per second. Wally Pfister tested shooting some of these sequences using a high speed [[Digital cinematography|digital camera]], but found the format to be too unreliable due to technical glitches. \"Out of six times that we shot on the digital format, we only had one useable piece and it didn't end up in the film.

Franklin had artists build concepts while Nolan expressed his ideal vision: \"Something glacial, with clear modernist architecture, but with chunks of it breaking off into the sea like icebergs\".<ref name=\"trussell\" /> Franklin and his team ended up with \"something that looked like an iceberg version of [[Gotham City]] with water running through it.\"<ref name=\"trussell\" /> They created a basic model of a glacier and then designers created a program that added elements like roads, intersections and ravines until they had a complex, yet organic-looking, cityscape. For the Paris-folding sequence, Franklin had artists producing concept sketches and then they created rough computer animations to give them an idea of what the sequence looked like while in motion. Later during principal photography, Nolan was able to direct Leonardo DiCaprio and Ellen Page based on this rough computer animation that Franklin had created. ''Inception'' had nearly 500 visual effects shots (in comparison, ''[[Batman Begins]]'' had approximately 620), which is relatively few in comparison to contemporary effects-heavy films, which can have as many as 2,000 visual effects shots.<ref name=\"trussell\" />\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Inception: Music from the Motion Picture}}\n\nThe score for ''Inception'' was written by [[Hans Zimmer]],<ref name=\"CinemaRewind\" /> who described his work as \"a very electronic,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/inception-score-hans-zimmers-mikee-65200 |title=Hans Zimmer's 'Inception' Score Will Release On July 13th |publisher=ScreenRant.com |access-date=July 1, 2010 |date=June 18, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625130549/http://screenrant.com/inception-score-hans-zimmers-mikee-65200/ |archivedate=June 25, 2010}}</ref> dense score\",<ref name=\"Cassidy\"/> filled with \"nostalgia and sadness\" to match Cobb's feelings throughout the film.<ref name=\"Martens\"/> The music was written simultaneously to filming,<ref name=\"Cassidy\">{{cite news |last=Cassidy |first=Kevin |title=Q&A: Composer Hans Zimmer |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=July 13, 2010 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/qampa-composer-hans-zimmer-25455|accessdate=July 14, 2010}}</ref> and features a guitar sound reminiscent of [[Ennio Morricone]], played by [[Johnny Marr]], former guitarist of [[The Smiths]].\n[[\u00c9dith Piaf]]'s \"[[Non, je ne regrette rien]]\" (\"No, I Regret Nothing\") appears throughout the film, used to accurately time the dreams, and Zimmer reworked pieces of the song into cues of the score.<ref name=\"Martens\">{{cite news |last=Martens |first=Todd |title=Hans Zimmer and Johnny Marr talk about the sad romance of 'Inception' |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=July 20, 2010 |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2010/07/inception-christopher-nolan-the-smiths-johnny-marr-hans-zimmer-and-johnny-marr-on-the-sound-of-inception-its-about-sadness.html |access-date=July 20, 2010}}</ref>\n[[Inception: Music from the Motion Picture|A soundtrack album]] was released on July 11, 2010 by [[Reprise Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inceptionscore.com/|title=Inception: Music from the Motion Picture official website|publisher=Warner Bros.|access-date=July 3, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616131408/http://www.inceptionscore.com/|archive-date=June 16, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The majority of the score was also included in high resolution [[5.1 surround sound]] on the second disc of the 2 disc Blu-ray release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Inception-Blu-ray/14492/#Review|title=Inception Blu-ray review from Blu-ray.com|access-date=August 8, 2012}}</ref> Hans Zimmer's music was nominated for an Academy Award in the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] category in 2011, losing to [[Trent Reznor]] and [[Atticus Ross]] of ''[[The Social Network]]''.<ref name=oscars/>\n\n==Themes==\n\n===Reality and dreams===\n[[File:Impossible staircase.svg|right|thumb|[[Penrose stairs]] are incorporated into the film as an example of the [[impossible object]]s that can be created in [[lucid dream]] worlds.|alt=A staircase in a square format.

This demand of production parallel to consumption of the images, on the part of the audience is analogous to dreaming itself. As in the film's story, in a cinema one enters into the space of another's dream, in this case Nolan's, as with any work of art, one's reading of it is ultimately influenced by one's own subjective desires and subconscious.<ref name='Paul'/> At Bir-Hakeim bridge in Paris, Ariadne creates an illusion of infinity by adding [[Infinity mirror|facing mirrors]] underneath its struts, Stephanie Dreyfus in ''la Croix'' asked \"Is this not a strong, beautiful metaphor for the cinema and its power of illusion?\"<ref>Dreyfus, St\u00e9phanie [http://www.la-croix.com/Culture-Loisirs/Culture/Actualite/Inception-allegorie-onirique-sur-l-illusion-cinematographique-_NG_-2010-07-20-554535 \"Inception\", all\u00e9gorie onirique sur l'illusion cin\u00e9matographique] ''[[La Croix]]'', July 20, 2010.

As the film's main antagonist, she is a frequent, malevolent presence in his dreams. Dom is unable to control these projections of her, challenging his abilities as an extractor.<ref name=\"threecircle\" /> Nolan described Mal as \"the essence of the femme fatale\",<ref name=\"Production Notes 2010, p. 9\">{{cite web|url=http://wwws.warnerbros.co.uk/inception/mainsite/pdf/INCEPTION_PK_Notes__Bios_6-18.pdf|title=Production Notes 2010, p. 9|publisher=}}</ref> the key ''noir'' reference in the film.

In this way, exposition takes precedence over characterization. The characters' relationships are created by their respective skills and roles.

It then runs southeastward, meeting [[Wisconsin Highway 129|WIS&nbsp;129]], an eastern bypass of Lancaster, before exiting its concurrencies with US&nbsp;61 and WIS&nbsp;33. From there. it continues running southeast, passing the [[Ellenboro, Wisconsin|community of Ellenboro]] and running concurrently with CTH-D before entering [[Platteville, Wisconsin|Platteville]] along Lancaster Street. The highway then runs along a few of the streets in Platteville and ends its concurrency with CTH-D before starting another concurrency with [[Wisconsin Highway 80|WIS&nbsp;80]].<ref name=gmaps/>\n\nThe highway runs southeasterly along the WIS&nbsp;80 concurrency, intersecting with [[U.S. Route 151 Business (Platteville, Wisconsin)|Business US&nbsp;151]] (Bus.

It then curves to the south, passing by [[Platteville Municipal Airport]] before exiting its concurrency with WIS&nbsp;80 and running east from it. The highway runs directly eastward, passing by [[Elk Grove (community), Wisconsin|Elk Grove]] and intersecting with [[Wisconsin Highway 126|WIS&nbsp;126]] and numerous county trunk highways before running along a short concurrency with [[Wisconsin Highway 23|WIS&nbsp;23]] in [[Darlington, Wisconsin|Darlington]]. From there, it runs along the [[Pecatonica River]] before it runs south of the highway, and the highway runs east, passing through the [[Lamont (community), Wisconsin|community of Lamont]] before running along a short concurrency with [[Wisconsin Highway 78|WIS&nbsp;78]] in [[Argyle, Wisconsin|Argyle]].<ref name=gmaps/>\n\nEast of Argyle, the highway runs southeasterly towards [[Monroe, Wisconsin|Monroe]] before running concurrently with [[Wisconsin Highway 11|WIS&nbsp;11]] along a bypass alignment just north of Monroe. The concurrency runs east, passing by [[Juda, Wisconsin|Juda]] before the highway leaves the concurrency and runs southeast from it. The highway curves east in [[Newark, Wisconsin|Newark]] before entering [[Beloit, Wisconsin|Beloit]] along Liberty Avenue. West of the [[Rock River (Mississippi River tributary)|Rock River]], the highway follows a short concurrency with [[Wisconsin Highway 213|WIS&nbsp;213]].
