Unpaid labor such as personal housework or caring for children or pets is not considered part of the working week.\n\nMany countries regulate the [[work week]] by law, such as stipulating minimum daily [[Break (work)|rest periods]], annual [[Civic holiday|holidays]], and a [[Eight-hour day|maximum number of working hours]] per week. Working time may vary from person to person, often depending on economic conditions, location, culture, lifestyle choice, and the profitability of the individual's livelihood. For example, someone who is supporting children and paying a large mortgage might need to work more hours to meet basic [[cost of living|costs of living]] than someone of the same [[earning power]] with lower housing costs. In developed countries like the United Kingdom, some workers are part-time because they are unable to find full-time work, but many choose reduced work hours to care for children or other family; some choose it simply to increase leisure time.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/mother-tongue/9236466/More-and-more-workers-join-the-part-time-revolution.html| title=More and more workers join the part-time revolution |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |first=Judith |last=Woods |date=1 May 2012 |location=London}}</ref>\n\n'''Standard working hours''' (or normal working hours) refers to the legislation to limit the working hours per day, per week, per month or per year.

Reduced hours also save money on [[day care]] costs and transportation, which in turn helps the environment with less carbon-related emissions. These benefits increase [[workforce productivity]] on a per-hour basis.\n\n== Workweek structure ==\n{{redirect|9-5|the car|Saab 9-5|the 1980 film|9 to 5 (film)}}\n{{other uses|day job|9 to 5 (disambiguation)}}\n{{Main|Workweek}}\nThe structure of the work week varies considerably for different professions and cultures. Among salaried workers in the western world, the work [[week]] often consists of Monday to Friday or Saturday with the [[Workweek|weekend]] set aside as a time of personal work and leisure. Sunday is set aside in the western world because it is the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Christian sabbath]].\n\nThe traditional American [[business hours]] are 9:00&nbsp;a.m. to 5:00&nbsp;p.m., Monday to Friday, representing a workweek of five [[eight-hour day]]s comprising 40 hours in total. These are the origin of the phrase '''9-to-5''', used to describe a conventional and possibly tedious [[Job (role)|job]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/nine-to-five%20job|title=nine-to-five job|publisher=}}</ref> Negatively used, it connotes a tedious or unremarkable occupation. The phrase also indicates that a person is an [[employee]], usually in a large company, rather than an [[entrepreneur]] or [[self-employed]]. More neutrally, it connotes a job with stable hours and low career risk, but still a position of [[subordinate]] employment. The actual time '''at work''' often varies between 35 and 48 hours in practice due to the inclusion, or lack of inclusion, of [[Break (work)|breaks]]. In many traditional [[White-collar worker|white collar]] positions, employees were required to be in the [[office]] during these hours to take orders from the bosses, hence the relationship between this phrase and subordination. Workplace hours have become more flexible, but the phrase is still commonly used.\n\nSeveral countries have adopted a workweek from Monday morning until Friday noon, either due to religious rules (observation of [[shabbat]] in [[Israel]] whose workweek is Sunday to Friday afternoon) or the growing predominance of a 35\u201337,5 hour workweek in continental Europe. Several of the Muslim countries have a standard Sunday through Thursday or Saturday through Wednesday workweek leaving Friday for religious observance, and providing breaks for the daily prayer times.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Some organizations follow a [[four-day week|4-day work week]]. Some government services have a modified schedule that provides evening hours on at least one day a week, for the convenience of constituents, at the expense of regular business hours elsewhere in the week.\n\n==Average annual hours actually worked per worker==\n===OECD ranking===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"|} style=\"margin:auto; width:100%;\"\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+2016<ref name=\"OECD\">{{cite web |title=Average annual hours actually worked per worker |publisher=OECD|url=https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=ANHRS}}</ref>\n|-  style=background:#ececec; vertical-align:top;\n!Rank !!

The Law 2000-37 on working time reduction is also referred to as the Aubry Law, according to the name of the Labor Minister at that time.\nEmployees can (and do) work more than 35 hours a week, yet in this case firms must pay them overtime bonuses. If the bonus is determined through collective negotiations, it cannot be lower than 10%. If no agreement on working time is signed, the legal bonus must be of 25% for the first 8 hours, then goes up to 50% for the rest.\nIncluding overtime, the maximum working time cannot exceed 48 hours per week, and should not exceed 44 hours per week over 12 weeks in a row. \nIn France the labor law also regulates the minimum working hours: part-time jobs should not allow for less than 24 hours per week without a branch collective agreement. These agreements can allow for less, under tight conditions.\nAccording to the official statistics (DARES),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dares.travail-emploi.gouv.fr/dares-etudes-et-statistiques/statistiques-de-a-a-z/article/la-duree-individuelle-du-travail|title=La dur\u00e9e individuelle du travail - Minist\u00e8re\u202fdu\u202fTravail|website=dares.travail-emploi.gouv.fr|accessdate=Jul 28, 2019}}</ref> after the introduction of the law on working time reduction, actual hours per week performed by full-time employed, fell from 39.6 hours in 1999, to a trough of 37.7 hours in 2002, then gradually went back to 39.1 hours in 2005.

Indeed, private sector employees often work overtime without receiving overtime compensation.

Employees typically receive either 12 or 14 payments per year, with approximately a 21-day vacation. According to Spanish regulation, Spain holds what is known as the [http://www.convenioscolectivos.net/ Convenios-Colectivos], which stipulates that based on the type of job, different regulations and laws regarding employee work week and wage apply.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spanish-living.com/employment-law-in-spain/|title=Guide to Employment law in Spain|date=2018-11-01|website=Spanish Living|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-08-02}}</ref> Overall they rank as the 13th highest in regard to international GDP growth.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Jobless record|doi = 10.1787/702131842121}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://data.oecd.org/spain.htm|title=Spain - OECD Data|website=theOECD|language=en|access-date=2019-08-02}}</ref>\n\nHowever, one of the interesting aspects of the Spanish work day and labor is the presence of a break around lunchtime. It's been mistakenly thought to be due to [[siesta]], but the reality is that the midday meal is the main one in Spain and workers used to go back home to have that meal with their families. That break, typically of 1 or 2 hours, has been kept in the working culture. Many restaurants and businesses shut down during this time period of 2-5 for retail and 4-8 for restaurants.\n\nA majority of adults emphasize the lack of a siesta during the typical work week.\n\n=== Australia ===\nIn Australia, between 1974 and 1997 no marked change took place in the average amount of time spent at work by Australians of \"prime working age\" (that is, between 25 and 54 years of age). Throughout this period, the average time spent at work by prime working-age Australians (including those who did not spend any time at work) remained stable at between 27 and 28 hours per week. This unchanging average, however, masks a significant redistribution of work from men to women. Between 1974 and 1997, the average time spent at work by prime working-age Australian men fell from 45 to 36 hours per week, while the average time spent at work by prime working-age Australian women rose from 12 to 19 hours per week. In the period leading up to 1997, the amount of time Australian workers spent at work outside the hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays also increased.<ref>[http://www.jamesmahmudrice.info/Overwork.pdf Bittman, Michael & Rice, James Mahmud.

Wage earners are compensated on a per-hour basis, whereas salaried workers are compensated on a per-week or per-job basis, and commission workers get paid according to how much they produce or sell.\n\nUnder most circumstances, wage earners and lower-level employees may be legally required by an employer to work more than forty hours in a week; however, they are paid extra for the additional work. Many salaried workers and commission-paid sales staff are not covered by overtime laws. These are generally called \"exempt\" positions, because they are exempt from federal and state laws that mandate extra pay for extra time worked.<ref name=\"titleWhat do the terms exempt and nonexempt mean?\">{{cite web |url=http://www.opm.gov/flsa/what.asp |title=What do the terms exempt and nonexempt mean? |accessdate=2008-01-28 }}</ref>  The rules are complex, but generally exempt workers are executives, professionals, or sales staff.<ref name=\"titleelaws - Fair Labor Standards Act Advisor\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dol.gov/elaws/esa/flsa/screen75.asp |title=elaws \u2013 Fair Labor Standards Act Advisor |accessdate=2008-01-28 }}</ref>  For example, school teachers are not paid extra for working extra hours.

The Managing Director of Century Environmental Services Group, Catherine Yan, said \"Employees may want to work more to obtain a higher salary due to financial reasons. If standard working hour legislation is passed, employers will need to pay a higher salary to employees, and hence the employers may choose to segment work tasks to employer more part time employees instead of providing overtime pay to employees.\" She thinks this will lead to a situation that the employees may need to find two part-time jobs to earn their living, making them wasting more time on transportation from one job to another.<ref>[https://archive.is/20130215141525/http://stock.appledaily.com/News/Detail?articleId=18035110&issueId=20121008&backpage=2 {{in lang|zh}} \u5927\u5931\u9810\u7b97-\u6700\u4f4e\u5de5\u8cc7\u66fe\u885d\u64ca\u696d\u754c] \u6e2f\u80a1\u738b \u2013 \u860b\u679c\u65e5\u5831\uff0c2012-10-08</ref>\n\nThe Chairman of the [[Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce]], [[Chow Chung-kong]] believes that it is so difficult to implement standard working hours that apply \u201cacross-the-board\u201d, specifically, to accountants and barristers.<ref>[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1056078/chamber-chief-suggests-labour-import Chamber chief suggests labor import] SCMP, 2012-10-08</ref> In addition, he believes that standard working hours may decrease individual employees' working hours and would not increase their actual income.

Also, if the number of hours worked of the worker is less than 44 hours every alternate week, the 44-hour weekly limit may be exceeded in the other week. Yet, this is subjected to the pre-specification in the service contract and the maximum should not exceed 48 hours per week or 88 hours in any consecutive two week time.

However, many workers and especially managers will stay later in the office due to additional work load. However, large Indian companies and MNC offices located in India tend to follow a 5-day, 8- to 9-hour per day working schedule.

[[Telecommuting]] permits employees to work from their homes or in satellite locations (not owned by the employer), eliminating or reducing long commute times in heavily populated areas.

Reduced hours also save money on [[day care]] costs and transportation, which in turn helps the environment with less carbon-related emissions. These benefits increase [[workforce productivity]] on a per-hour basis.\n\n== Workweek structure ==\n{{redirect|9-5|the car|Saab 9-5|the 1980 film|9 to 5 (film)}}\n{{other uses|day job|9 to 5 (disambiguation)}}\n{{Main|Workweek}}\nThe structure of the work week varies considerably for different professions and cultures. Among salaried workers in the western world, the work [[week]] often consists of Monday to Friday or Saturday with the [[Workweek|weekend]] set aside as a time of personal work and leisure. Sunday is set aside in the western world because it is the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Christian sabbath]].\n\nThe traditional American [[business hours]] are 9:00&nbsp;a.m. to 5:00&nbsp;p.m., Monday to Friday, representing a workweek of five [[eight-hour day]]s comprising 40 hours in total. These are the origin of the phrase '''9-to-5''', used to describe a conventional and possibly tedious [[Job (role)|job]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/nine-to-five%20job|title=nine-to-five job|publisher=}}</ref> Negatively used, it connotes a tedious or unremarkable occupation. The phrase also indicates that a person is an [[employee]], usually in a large company, rather than an [[entrepreneur]] or [[self-employed]]. More neutrally, it connotes a job with stable hours and low career risk, but still a position of [[subordinate]] employment. The actual time '''at work''' often varies between 35 and 48 hours in practice due to the inclusion, or lack of inclusion, of [[Break (work)|breaks]]. In many traditional [[White-collar worker|white collar]] positions, employees were required to be in the [[office]] during these hours to take orders from the bosses, hence the relationship between this phrase and subordination. Workplace hours have become more flexible, but the phrase is still commonly used.\n\nSeveral countries have adopted a workweek from Monday morning until Friday noon, either due to religious rules (observation of [[shabbat]] in [[Israel]] whose workweek is Sunday to Friday afternoon) or the growing predominance of a 35\u201337,5 hour workweek in continental Europe. Several of the Muslim countries have a standard Sunday through Thursday or Saturday through Wednesday workweek leaving Friday for religious observance, and providing breaks for the daily prayer times.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Some organizations follow a [[four-day week|4-day work week]]. Some government services have a modified schedule that provides evening hours on at least one day a week, for the convenience of constituents, at the expense of regular business hours elsewhere in the week.\n\n==Average annual hours actually worked per worker==\n===OECD ranking===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"|} style=\"margin:auto; width:100%;\"\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+2016<ref name=\"OECD\">{{cite web |title=Average annual hours actually worked per worker |publisher=OECD|url=https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=ANHRS}}</ref>\n|-  style=background:#ececec; vertical-align:top;\n!Rank !!

The Law 2000-37 on working time reduction is also referred to as the Aubry Law, according to the name of the Labor Minister at that time.\nEmployees can (and do) work more than 35 hours a week, yet in this case firms must pay them overtime bonuses. If the bonus is determined through collective negotiations, it cannot be lower than 10%. If no agreement on working time is signed, the legal bonus must be of 25% for the first 8 hours, then goes up to 50% for the rest.\nIncluding overtime, the maximum working time cannot exceed 48 hours per week, and should not exceed 44 hours per week over 12 weeks in a row. \nIn France the labor law also regulates the minimum working hours: part-time jobs should not allow for less than 24 hours per week without a branch collective agreement.

Throughout this period, the average time spent at work by prime working-age Australians (including those who did not spend any time at work) remained stable at between 27 and 28 hours per week. This unchanging average, however, masks a significant redistribution of work from men to women. Between 1974 and 1997, the average time spent at work by prime working-age Australian men fell from 45 to 36 hours per week, while the average time spent at work by prime working-age Australian women rose from 12 to 19 hours per week.

Wage earners are compensated on a per-hour basis, whereas salaried workers are compensated on a per-week or per-job basis, and commission workers get paid according to how much they produce or sell.\n\nUnder most circumstances, wage earners and lower-level employees may be legally required by an employer to work more than forty hours in a week; however, they are paid extra for the additional work. Many salaried workers and commission-paid sales staff are not covered by overtime laws.

The organization thinks that long working time adversely affects the family and social life and health of employees; it also indicates that the current Employment Ordinance does not regulate overtime pays, working time limits nor rest day pays, which can protect employees rights.\n\n=====Businesses and related organizations=====\nGenerally, business sector agrees that it is important to achieve work-life balance, but does not support a legislation to regulate working hours limit. They believe \"standard working hours\" is not the best way to achieve work-life balance and the root cause of the long working hours in Hong Kong is due to insufficient labor supply. The Managing Director of Century Environmental Services Group, Catherine Yan, said \"Employees may want to work more to obtain a higher salary due to financial reasons. If standard working hour legislation is passed, employers will need to pay a higher salary to employees, and hence the employers may choose to segment work tasks to employer more part time employees instead of providing overtime pay to employees.\" She thinks this will lead to a situation that the employees may need to find two part-time jobs to earn their living, making them wasting more time on transportation from one job to another.<ref>[https://archive.is/20130215141525/http://stock.appledaily.com/News/Detail?articleId=18035110&issueId=20121008&backpage=2 {{in lang|zh}} \u5927\u5931\u9810\u7b97-\u6700\u4f4e\u5de5\u8cc7\u66fe\u885d\u64ca\u696d\u754c] \u6e2f\u80a1\u738b \u2013 \u860b\u679c\u65e5\u5831\uff0c2012-10-08</ref>\n\nThe Chairman of the [[Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce]], [[Chow Chung-kong]] believes that it is so difficult to implement standard working hours that apply \u201cacross-the-board\u201d, specifically, to accountants and barristers.<ref>[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1056078/chamber-chief-suggests-labour-import Chamber chief suggests labor import] SCMP, 2012-10-08</ref> In addition, he believes that standard working hours may decrease individual employees' working hours and would not increase their actual income.

The term ''circus'' also describes the performance which has followed various formats through its 250-year modern history. Although not the inventor of the medium, [[Philip Astley]] is credited as the father of the modern circus. In 1768 Astley, a skilled equestrian, began performing exhibitions of trick horse riding in an open field called Ha'Penny Hatch on the south side of the [[Thames River]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Circus! The Australian Story|last=St Leon|first=Mark|publisher=Melbourne Books|year=2011|isbn=978-1-877096-50-1|location=|pages=7}}</ref> In 1770 he hired acrobats, tightrope walkers, jugglers and a clown to fill in the pauses between the equestrian demonstrations and thus chanced on the format which was later named a \"circus\". Performances developed significantly over the next fifty years, with large-scale theatrical battle reenactments becoming a significant feature. The traditional format, in which a ringmaster introduces a variety of choreographed acts set to music, developed in the latter part of the 19th century and remained the dominant format until the 1970s.\n \t\nAs styles of performance have developed since the time of Astley, so too have the types of venues where these circuses have performed. The earliest modern circuses were performed in open-air structures with limited covered seating. From the late 18th to late 19th century, custom-made circus buildings (often wooden) were built with various types of seating, a centre ring, and sometimes a stage. The traditional large tents commonly known as \"big tops\" were introduced in the mid-19th century as touring circuses superseded static venues. These tents eventually became the most common venue. Contemporary circuses perform in a variety of venues including tents, theatres and casinos. Many circus performances are still held in a ring, usually 13&nbsp;m (42&nbsp;ft) in diameter. This dimension was adopted by Astley in the late 18th century as the minimum diameter that enabled an acrobatic horse rider to stand upright on a cantering horse to perform their tricks.\n \t\n[[Contemporary circus]] has been credited with a revival of the circus tradition since the late 1970s, when a number of groups began to experiment with new circus formats and aesthetics, typically avoiding the use of animals to focus exclusively on human artistry. Circuses within the movement have tended to favor a theatrical approach, combining character-driven circus acts with original music in a broad variety of styles to convey complex themes or stories. Contemporary circus continues to develop new variations on the circus tradition while absorbing new skills, techniques and stylistic influences from other performing arts.\n \n\n==Etymology==\nFirst attested in English 14th century, the word ''circus'' derives from [[Latin]] ''circus'',<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dcircus circus], \nCharlton T.

However, the history of circuses is more complex, with historians disagreeing on its origin, as well as revisions being done about the history due to the changing nature of historical research, and the ongoing circus phenomenon. For many, circus history begins with Englishman [[Philip Astley]], while for others its origins go back much further\u2014to [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times.\n\n===Origins===\n\nIn Ancient Rome, the ''[[Circus (building)|circus]]'' was a building for the exhibition of horse and chariot races, equestrian shows, staged battles, gladiatorial combat and displays of (and fights with) trained animals. The circuses of Rome were similar to the ancient Greek [[hippodrome]]s, although circuses served varying purposes and differed in design and construction, and for events that involved re-enactments of naval battles, the circus was flooded with water. The Roman circus buildings were, however, not circular but rectangular with semi circular ends. The lower seats were reserved for persons of rank; there were also various state boxes for the giver of the games and his friends. The circus was the only public spectacle at which men and women were not separated.  Some circus historians such as [[George Speaight]] have stated \"these performances may have taken place in the great arenas that were called 'circuses' by the Romans, but it is a mistake to equate these places, or the entertainments presented there, with the modern circus\" <ref>{{cite book|last=Speaight|first=George|title=A History of the Circus|year=1980|publisher=The Tantivy Press|location=London|isbn=978-0498024702|page=11}}</ref> Others have argued that the lineage of the circus does go back to the Roman circuses and a chronology of circus-related entertainment can be traced to Roman times, continued by the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]] that operated until the 13th century, through medieval and renaissance jesters, minstrels and troubadours to the late 18th century and the time of Astley. <ref>{{cite book|last=Croft-Cooke & Cotes|first=Rupert & Peter|title=Circus: A World History|year=1976|publisher=Paul Elek|location=London|isbn=978-0236400515|page=27}}</ref> <ref>{{cite book |last= Dagron |first=Gilbert |title= L' Hippodrome de Constantinople: Jeux, Peuple et Politique |year=2011 |publisher= \u00c9ditions Gallimard|location=Paris |isbn=978-2-07-013378-9}}</ref>\n\nThe first circus in the city of Rome was the [[Circus Maximus]], in the valley between the Palatine and Aventine hills.  It was constructed during the monarchy and, at first, built completely from wood. After being rebuilt several times, the final version of the Circus Maximus could seat 250,000 people; it was built of stone and measured 400m in length and 90m in width.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.novaroma.org/ludi/html/history.html |title=History of the Ludi |publisher=Novaroma.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-20}}</ref> Next in importance were the [[Circus Flaminius]] and the [[Circus of Nero|Circus Neronis]], from the notoriety which it obtained through the Circensian pleasures of Nero. A [[Circus of Maxentius|fourth circus]] was constructed by [[Maxentius]]; its ruins have helped archaeologists reconstruct the Roman circus.\n\nFor some time after the fall of Rome, large circus buildings fell out of use as centres of mass entertainment. Instead, itinerant performers, animal trainers and showmen travelled between towns throughout Europe, performing at local fairs. <!--Another possible link between the Roman and modern circus could have been bands of [[Romani people|Gypsies]] who appeared in Europe in the 14th century and in Britain from the 15th century, bringing with them circus skills and trained animals.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} ['''Factually incomplete.

In 1825, [[Joshuah Purdy Brown]] was the first circus owner to use a large canvas tent for the circus performance. Circus pioneer [[Dan Rice]] was the most famous pre-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] circus clown,<ref name=carlyon>David Carlyon.

Coup also introduced the first multiple-ring circuses, and was also the first circus entrepreneur to use [[circus train]]s to transport the circus between towns. \n[[File:The grand lay-out, 1874.jpg|thumb|Circus parade around tents, in lithograph by Gibson & Co., 1874]]\n\n====Touring ====\nIn 1838, the equestrian [[Thomas Taplin Cooke]] returned to England from the United States, bringing with him a circus tent.<ref name=\"Slout1998\">{{cite book|author=William L.

[[William Batty]]'s circus, for example, between 1838 and 1840, travelled from Newcastle to Edinburgh and then to Portsmouth and Southampton.

Soullier was the first circus owner to introduce Chinese acrobatics to the European circus when he returned from his travels in 1866, and Tourniaire was the first to introduce the performing art to Ranga, where it became extremely popular. \n[[File:Lion tamer (LOC pga.03749).jpg|thumb|left|[[Lion tamer]], in lithograph by Gibson & Co., 1873]]\nAfter an 1881 merger with [[James Anthony Bailey]] and James L. Hutchinson's circus and Barnum's death in 1891, his circus travelled to Europe as the Barnum & Bailey Greatest Show On Earth, where it toured from 1897 to 1902, impressing other circus owners with its large scale, its touring techniques (including the tent and circus train), and its combination of circus acts, a zoological exhibition and a freak show. This format was adopted by European circuses at the turn of the 20th century.\n\nThe influence of the American circus brought about a considerable change in the character of the modern circus. In arenas too large for speech to be easily audible, the traditional comic dialog of the clown assumed a less prominent place than formerly, while the vastly increased wealth of stage properties relegated to the background the old-fashioned equestrian feats, which were replaced by more ambitious acrobatic performances, and by exhibitions of skill, strength and daring, requiring the employment of immense numbers of performers and often of complicated and expensive machinery.\n[[File:Arturo Michelena 00.JPG|thumb|Painting by Venezuelan [[Arturo Michelena]], c. 1891, depicting a backstage area at the circus]]\n\nFrom the late 19th century through the first half of the 20th century, travelling circuses were a major form of spectator entertainment in the US and attracted huge attention whenever they arrived in a city. After World War II, the popularity of the circus declined as new forms of entertainment (such as television) arrived and the public's tastes became more sophisticated. From the 1960s onward, circuses attracted growing criticism from [[animal rights]] activists. Many circuses went out of business or were forced to merge with other circus companies. Nonetheless, a good number of travelling circuses are still active in various parts of the world, ranging from small family enterprises to three-ring extravaganzas. Other companies found new ways to draw in the public with innovative new approaches to the circus form itself.\n\n====Russia====\nIn 1919, [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], head of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]], expressed a wish for the circus to become \"the people's art-form\", with facilities and status on par with theatre, opera and ballet. The USSR nationalized Russian circuses. In 1927, the [[State University of Circus and Variety Arts]], better known as the Moscow Circus School, was established; performers were trained using methods developed from the Soviet gymnastics program. When the Moscow State Circus company began international tours in the 1950s, its levels of originality and artistic skill were widely applauded.\n\n====China====\nCircuses from China, drawing on Chinese traditions of [[acrobatics]], like the [[Chinese State Circus]] are also popular touring acts.\n\n===Contemporary circus===\n{{main|Contemporary circus}}\n[[Image:Dralion-Vienna.jpg|left|thumb|[[Cirque du Soleil]] performing ''[[Dralion]]'' in [[Vienna]], 2004]]\n\n[[Contemporary circus]] (originally known as ''nouveau cirque'') is a performing arts movement that originated in the 1970s in Australia, Canada, France,<ref>\u00ab Historique de la c\u00e9l\u00e8bre crise \u00bb, [[Jean-Pierre Thiollet]], ''\u00c9cole ouverte'', n\u00b085, February 1982, http://doc.cnac.fr/ListRecord.htm?list=link&xRecord=19102592157919207749</ref> the West Coast of the United States, and the United Kingdom. Contemporary circus combines traditional circus skills and theatrical techniques to convey a story or theme. Compared with the traditional circus, the contemporary genre of circus tends to focus more attention on the overall aesthetic impact, on character and story development, and on the use of [[lighting design]], original music, and [[costume design]] to convey thematic or narrative content. For aesthetic or economic reasons, contemporary circus productions may sometimes be staged in theatres rather than in large outdoor tents. Music used in the production is often composed exclusively for that production, and aesthetic influences are drawn as much from contemporary culture as from circus history.  Animal acts appear rarely in contemporary circus, in contrast to traditional circus, where animal acts have often been a significant part of the entertainment.\n\nEarly pioneers of the contemporary circus genre included: [[Circus Oz]], forged in Australia in 1977 from SoapBox Circus (1976) and New Circus (1973);<ref>{{cite book |last1=St Leon |first1=Mark |title=Circus!

The ringmaster presents performers, speaks to the audience, and generally keeps the show moving. The activity of the circus traditionally takes place within a ring; large circuses may have multiple rings, like the six-ringed [[Moscow State Circus]]. A circus often travels with its own band, whose instrumentation in the United States has traditionally included [[brass instrument]]s, drums, [[glockenspiel]], and sometimes the distinctive sound of the [[calliope (music)|calliope]].\n\n===Acts===\n{{See also|List of circus skills}}{{World circus bans}}\nCommon acts include a variety of [[acrobatics]], [[gymnastics]] (including [[Tumbling (gymnastics)|tumbling]] and [[trampoline]]), aerial acts (such as [[trapeze]], [[aerial silk]], [[corde lisse]]), [[contortion]], [[stilts]], and a variety of other routines. [[Juggling]] is one of the most common acts in a circus; the combination of juggling and gymnastics is called [[equilibristics]] and includes acts like [[plate spinning]] and the [[rolling globe]]. Acts like these are some of the most common and the most traditional. [[Clown]]s are common to most circuses and are typically skilled in many circus acts; \"clowns getting into the act\" is a very familiar theme in any circus. Famous circus clowns have included [[Austin Miles]], the [[Fratellini Family]], Rusty Russell, [[Emmett Kelly]], [[Grock]], and [[Bill Irwin]].\n\nDaredevil [[Stunt performer|stunt acts]] and [[sideshow|sideshow acts]] are also parts of some circus acts, these activities may include [[human cannonball]], [[chapeaugraphy]], [[fire eating]], [[Fire breathing|breathing]], and [[Fire dancing|dancing]], [[Impalement arts|knife throwing]], [[Magic (illusion)|magic shows]], [[sword swallowing]], or [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]]. Famous sideshow performers include [[Zip the Pinhead]] and [[The Doll Family]]. A popular sideshow attraction from the early 19th century was the [[flea circus]], where fleas were attached to props and viewed through a [[Fresnel lens]].\n\n===Animal acts===\n{{Animal rights sidebar}}\n[[Image:Female animal trainer and leopard.jpg|thumb|Female [[Lion taming|lion tamer]] and leopard.]]\n[[Image:CircusElephantsLA.jpg|thumb|[[Elephant]]s from Cole Brothers Circus parade through downtown Los Angeles, 1953]]\n[[Image:Cirkus Safari u \u010cakovcu - konji.jpg|thumb|Circus [[horse]] act]]\nJess you stink omg like wow have historically been used in acts.

A poster for [[Pablo Fanque]]'s Circus Royal, one of the most popular circuses of Victorian England, inspired [[John Lennon]] to write [[Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!]] on [[The Beatles]]' album, ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.  The song title refers to [[William Kite]], a well-known circus performer in the 19th century. Producer [[George Martin]] and [[EMI]] engineers created the song's fairground atmosphere by assembling a sound collage of collected recordings of calliopes and fairground organs, which they cut into strips of various lengths, threw into a box, and then mixed up and edited together randomly, creating a long loop which was mixed into the final production.<ref>Turner, Steve, \"A Hard Day's Write.\" HarperCollins(1984).</ref> Another traditional circus song is the [[John Philip Sousa]] march \"[[Stars and Stripes Forever]]\", which is played only to alert circus performers of an emergency.\n\nPlays set in a circus include the 1896 musical ''The Circus Girl'' by [[Lionel Monckton]], ''Polly of the Circus'' written in 1907 by [[Margaret Mayo (playwright)|Margaret Mayo]], ''He Who Gets Slapped'' written by Russian [[Leonid Andreyev]] 1916 and later adapted into one of the first circus films, ''Katharina Knie'' written in 1928 by [[Carl Zuckmayer]] and adapted for the English stage in 1932 as ''Caravan'' by playwright Cecily Hamilton, the revue ''Big Top'' written by [[Herbert Farjeon]] in 1942, ''Top of the Ladder'' written by [[Tyrone Guthrie]] in 1950, ''Stop the World, I Want to Get Off'' written by [[Anthony Newley]] in 1961, and ''[[Barnum (musical)|Barnum]]'' with music by [[Cy Coleman]] and lyrics and book by [[Mark Bramble]], ''Roustabout: The Great Circus Train Wreck'' written by [[Jay Torrence]] in 2006.\n\nFollowing World War I, circus films became popular. In 1924 ''[[He Who Gets Slapped]]'' was the first film released by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]; in 1925 ''Sally of the Sawdust'' (remade 1930), ''[[Variety (1925 film)|Variety]]'', and ''Vaudeville'' were produced, followed by ''The Devil's Circus'' in 1926 and ''[[The Circus (1928 film)|The Circus]]'' starring [[Charlie Chaplin]], ''Circus Rookies'', ''[[4 Devils]]''; and ''Laugh Clown Laugh'' in 1928. German film ''[[Salto Mortale (1931 German film)|Salto Mortale]]'' about trapeze artists was released in 1931 and remade in the United States and released as ''[[Trapeze (film)|Trapeze]]'' starring [[Burt Lancaster]] in 1956; in 1932 ''[[Freaks (1932 film)|Freaks]]'' was released; ''Charlie Chan at the Circus'', ''Circus'' (USSR) and ''The Three Maxiums'' were released in 1936 and ''[[At the Circus]]'' starring the [[Marx Brothers]] and ''You Can't Cheat an Honest Man'' in 1939. Circus films continued to be popular during the Second World War; films from this era included ''The Great Profile'' starring [[John Barrymore]] (1940), the animated [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] film ''[[Dumbo]]'' (1941), ''Road Show'' (1941), ''[[The Wagons Roll at Night]]'' (1941) and ''Captive Wild Woman'' (1943).\n\n''Tromba'', a film about a tiger trainer, was released in 1948. In 1952 [[Cecil B. de Mille]]'s Oscar-winning film ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth (film)|The Greatest Show on Earth]]'' was first shown. Released in 1953 were ''Man on a Tightrope'' and [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s ''Gycklarnas afton'' (released as ''Sawdust and Tinsel'' in the United States); these were followed by ''Life Is a Circus''; ''Ring of Fear''; ''[[3 Ring Circus]]'' (1954) and ''[[La Strada]]'' (1954), an Oscar-winning film by [[Federico Fellini]] about a girl who is sold to a circus strongman. Fellini made a second film set in the circus called ''[[The Clowns (film)|The Clowns]]'' in 1970. Films about the circus made since 1959 include Disney's ''[[Toby Tyler]]'' (1960), the [[B-movie]] ''[[Circus of Horrors]]'' (also in 1960); the [[musical film]] ''[[Billy Rose's Jumbo (film)|Billy Rose's Jumbo]]'' (1962); ''A Tiger Walks'', a Disney film about a tiger that escapes from the circus; and ''[[Circus World (film)|Circus World]]'' (1964), starring [[John Wayne]]. [[Mera Naam Joker]] (1970) a Hindi drama film directed by [[Raj Kapoor]] which was about a clown who must make his audience laugh at the cost of his own sorrows.  In the film ''[[Jungle Emperor Leo]]'' (1997), Leo's son Lune is captured and placed in a circus, which burns down when a tiger knocks down a ring of fire while jumping through it. ''[[The Greatest Showman]]'', a musical film loosely based on the life of [[P. T. Barnum]], was released in 2017. \n\nThe TV series ''[[Circus Humberto]]'', based on the novel by [[Eduard Bass]], follows the history of the circus family Humberto between 1826 and 1924. The setting of the HBO television series ''[[Carniv\u00e0le]]'', which ran from 2003 to 2005, is also largely set in a travelling circus. The circus has also inspired many writers. Numerous books, both non-fiction and fiction, have been published about circus life. Notable examples of circus-based fiction include ''[[Circus Humberto]]'' by [[Eduard Bass]], ''[[Cirque du Freak]]'' by [[Darren Shan]], and ''[[Spangle (novel)|Spangle]]'' by [[Gary Jennings]].  The novel ''[[Water for Elephants]]'' by [[Sara Gruen]] tells the fictional tale of a circus veterinarian and was made into a [[Water for Elephants (film)|movie with the same title]], starring [[Robert Pattinson]] and [[Reese Witherspoon]].\n\nCircus is the central theme in comic books of [[Super Commando Dhruva]], an Indian comic book superhero. According to this series, Dhruva was born and brought up in a fictional Indian circus called Jupiter Circus. When a rival circus burnt down Jupiter Circus, killing everyone in it, including Dhruva's parents, Dhruva vowed to become a crime fighter. A circus-based television series called ''[[Circus (TV series)|Circus]]'' was also telecast in India in 1989 on [[DD National]], starring [[Shah Rukh Khan|Shahrukh Khan]] as the lead actor.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Animal training]]\n*[[Chautauqua]], tent shows that preceded American circus\n*[[Circus clown]]\n*[[Clown alley]]\n*[[Circus skills]]\n*[[Cirque du Soleil]]\n*[[Clown]]\n*[[Contemporary circus]]\n*[[Dog and pony show]]\n*[[Flea circus]]\n*[[International Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo]]\n*[[Traveling carnival]]\n*[[Lion taming]]\n*[[List of circuses and circus owners]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n*Assael, Brenda, \"Circus and Victorian Society\", 2005, University of Virginia Press, Charlottesville {{ISBN|0-8139-2340-9}}\n*[[Rupert Croft-Cooke|Croft-Cooke, Rupert]] and Cotes, Peter. 1976.

The term ''circus'' also describes the performance which has followed various formats through its 250-year modern history. Although not the inventor of the medium, [[Philip Astley]] is credited as the father of the modern circus. In 1768 Astley, a skilled equestrian, began performing exhibitions of trick horse riding in an open field called Ha'Penny Hatch on the south side of the [[Thames River]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Circus! The Australian Story|last=St Leon|first=Mark|publisher=Melbourne Books|year=2011|isbn=978-1-877096-50-1|location=|pages=7}}</ref> In 1770 he hired acrobats, tightrope walkers, jugglers and a clown to fill in the pauses between the equestrian demonstrations and thus chanced on the format which was later named a \"circus\". Performances developed significantly over the next fifty years, with large-scale theatrical battle reenactments becoming a significant feature. The traditional format, in which a ringmaster introduces a variety of choreographed acts set to music, developed in the latter part of the 19th century and remained the dominant format until the 1970s.\n \t\nAs styles of performance have developed since the time of Astley, so too have the types of venues where these circuses have performed. The earliest modern circuses were performed in open-air structures with limited covered seating. From the late 18th to late 19th century, custom-made circus buildings (often wooden) were built with various types of seating, a centre ring, and sometimes a stage. The traditional large tents commonly known as \"big tops\" were introduced in the mid-19th century as touring circuses superseded static venues. These tents eventually became the most common venue. Contemporary circuses perform in a variety of venues including tents, theatres and casinos. Many circus performances are still held in a ring, usually 13&nbsp;m (42&nbsp;ft) in diameter. This dimension was adopted by Astley in the late 18th century as the minimum diameter that enabled an acrobatic horse rider to stand upright on a cantering horse to perform their tricks.\n \t\n[[Contemporary circus]] has been credited with a revival of the circus tradition since the late 1970s, when a number of groups began to experiment with new circus formats and aesthetics, typically avoiding the use of animals to focus exclusively on human artistry. Circuses within the movement have tended to favor a theatrical approach, combining character-driven circus acts with original music in a broad variety of styles to convey complex themes or stories. Contemporary circus continues to develop new variations on the circus tradition while absorbing new skills, techniques and stylistic influences from other performing arts.\n \n\n==Etymology==\nFirst attested in English 14th century, the word ''circus'' derives from [[Latin]] ''circus'',<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dcircus circus], \nCharlton T.

However, the history of circuses is more complex, with historians disagreeing on its origin, as well as revisions being done about the history due to the changing nature of historical research, and the ongoing circus phenomenon. For many, circus history begins with Englishman [[Philip Astley]], while for others its origins go back much further\u2014to [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times.\n\n===Origins===\n\nIn Ancient Rome, the ''[[Circus (building)|circus]]'' was a building for the exhibition of horse and chariot races, equestrian shows, staged battles, gladiatorial combat and displays of (and fights with) trained animals. The circuses of Rome were similar to the ancient Greek [[hippodrome]]s, although circuses served varying purposes and differed in design and construction, and for events that involved re-enactments of naval battles, the circus was flooded with water. The Roman circus buildings were, however, not circular but rectangular with semi circular ends. The lower seats were reserved for persons of rank; there were also various state boxes for the giver of the games and his friends. The circus was the only public spectacle at which men and women were not separated.  Some circus historians such as [[George Speaight]] have stated \"these performances may have taken place in the great arenas that were called 'circuses' by the Romans, but it is a mistake to equate these places, or the entertainments presented there, with the modern circus\" <ref>{{cite book|last=Speaight|first=George|title=A History of the Circus|year=1980|publisher=The Tantivy Press|location=London|isbn=978-0498024702|page=11}}</ref> Others have argued that the lineage of the circus does go back to the Roman circuses and a chronology of circus-related entertainment can be traced to Roman times, continued by the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]] that operated until the 13th century, through medieval and renaissance jesters, minstrels and troubadours to the late 18th century and the time of Astley. <ref>{{cite book|last=Croft-Cooke & Cotes|first=Rupert & Peter|title=Circus: A World History|year=1976|publisher=Paul Elek|location=London|isbn=978-0236400515|page=27}}</ref> <ref>{{cite book |last= Dagron |first=Gilbert |title= L' Hippodrome de Constantinople: Jeux, Peuple et Politique |year=2011 |publisher= \u00c9ditions Gallimard|location=Paris |isbn=978-2-07-013378-9}}</ref>\n\nThe first circus in the city of Rome was the [[Circus Maximus]], in the valley between the Palatine and Aventine hills.  It was constructed during the monarchy and, at first, built completely from wood. After being rebuilt several times, the final version of the Circus Maximus could seat 250,000 people; it was built of stone and measured 400m in length and 90m in width.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.novaroma.org/ludi/html/history.html |title=History of the Ludi |publisher=Novaroma.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-20}}</ref> Next in importance were the [[Circus Flaminius]] and the [[Circus of Nero|Circus Neronis]], from the notoriety which it obtained through the Circensian pleasures of Nero. A [[Circus of Maxentius|fourth circus]] was constructed by [[Maxentius]]; its ruins have helped archaeologists reconstruct the Roman circus.\n\nFor some time after the fall of Rome, large circus buildings fell out of use as centres of mass entertainment. Instead, itinerant performers, animal trainers and showmen travelled between towns throughout Europe, performing at local fairs. <!--Another possible link between the Roman and modern circus could have been bands of [[Romani people|Gypsies]] who appeared in Europe in the 14th century and in Britain from the 15th century, bringing with them circus skills and trained animals.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} ['''Factually incomplete.

In 1825, [[Joshuah Purdy Brown]] was the first circus owner to use a large canvas tent for the circus performance. Circus pioneer [[Dan Rice]] was the most famous pre-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] circus clown,<ref name=carlyon>David Carlyon. ''Dan Rice: The Most Famous Man You've Never Heard Of''</ref> popularizing such expressions as \"The One-Horse Show\" and \"[[Hey, Rube!]]\". The American circus was revolutionized by [[P. T.

Coup also introduced the first multiple-ring circuses, and was also the first circus entrepreneur to use [[circus train]]s to transport the circus between towns. \n[[File:The grand lay-out, 1874.jpg|thumb|Circus parade around tents, in lithograph by Gibson & Co., 1874]]\n\n====Touring ====\nIn 1838, the equestrian [[Thomas Taplin Cooke]] returned to England from the United States, bringing with him a circus tent.<ref name=\"Slout1998\">{{cite book|author=William L.

Soullier was the first circus owner to introduce Chinese acrobatics to the European circus when he returned from his travels in 1866, and Tourniaire was the first to introduce the performing art to Ranga, where it became extremely popular. \n[[File:Lion tamer (LOC pga.03749).jpg|thumb|left|[[Lion tamer]], in lithograph by Gibson & Co., 1873]]\nAfter an 1881 merger with [[James Anthony Bailey]] and James L. Hutchinson's circus and Barnum's death in 1891, his circus travelled to Europe as the Barnum & Bailey Greatest Show On Earth, where it toured from 1897 to 1902, impressing other circus owners with its large scale, its touring techniques (including the tent and circus train), and its combination of circus acts, a zoological exhibition and a freak show. This format was adopted by European circuses at the turn of the 20th century.\n\nThe influence of the American circus brought about a considerable change in the character of the modern circus. In arenas too large for speech to be easily audible, the traditional comic dialog of the clown assumed a less prominent place than formerly, while the vastly increased wealth of stage properties relegated to the background the old-fashioned equestrian feats, which were replaced by more ambitious acrobatic performances, and by exhibitions of skill, strength and daring, requiring the employment of immense numbers of performers and often of complicated and expensive machinery.\n[[File:Arturo Michelena 00.JPG|thumb|Painting by Venezuelan [[Arturo Michelena]], c. 1891, depicting a backstage area at the circus]]\n\nFrom the late 19th century through the first half of the 20th century, travelling circuses were a major form of spectator entertainment in the US and attracted huge attention whenever they arrived in a city. After World War II, the popularity of the circus declined as new forms of entertainment (such as television) arrived and the public's tastes became more sophisticated. From the 1960s onward, circuses attracted growing criticism from [[animal rights]] activists. Many circuses went out of business or were forced to merge with other circus companies. Nonetheless, a good number of travelling circuses are still active in various parts of the world, ranging from small family enterprises to three-ring extravaganzas. Other companies found new ways to draw in the public with innovative new approaches to the circus form itself.\n\n====Russia====\nIn 1919, [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], head of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]], expressed a wish for the circus to become \"the people's art-form\", with facilities and status on par with theatre, opera and ballet. The USSR nationalized Russian circuses. In 1927, the [[State University of Circus and Variety Arts]], better known as the Moscow Circus School, was established; performers were trained using methods developed from the Soviet gymnastics program. When the Moscow State Circus company began international tours in the 1950s, its levels of originality and artistic skill were widely applauded.\n\n====China====\nCircuses from China, drawing on Chinese traditions of [[acrobatics]], like the [[Chinese State Circus]] are also popular touring acts.\n\n===Contemporary circus===\n{{main|Contemporary circus}}\n[[Image:Dralion-Vienna.jpg|left|thumb|[[Cirque du Soleil]] performing ''[[Dralion]]'' in [[Vienna]], 2004]]\n\n[[Contemporary circus]] (originally known as ''nouveau cirque'') is a performing arts movement that originated in the 1970s in Australia, Canada, France,<ref>\u00ab Historique de la c\u00e9l\u00e8bre crise \u00bb, [[Jean-Pierre Thiollet]], ''\u00c9cole ouverte'', n\u00b085, February 1982, http://doc.cnac.fr/ListRecord.htm?list=link&xRecord=19102592157919207749</ref> the West Coast of the United States, and the United Kingdom. Contemporary circus combines traditional circus skills and theatrical techniques to convey a story or theme. Compared with the traditional circus, the contemporary genre of circus tends to focus more attention on the overall aesthetic impact, on character and story development, and on the use of [[lighting design]], original music, and [[costume design]] to convey thematic or narrative content. For aesthetic or economic reasons, contemporary circus productions may sometimes be staged in theatres rather than in large outdoor tents. Music used in the production is often composed exclusively for that production, and aesthetic influences are drawn as much from contemporary culture as from circus history.  Animal acts appear rarely in contemporary circus, in contrast to traditional circus, where animal acts have often been a significant part of the entertainment.\n\nEarly pioneers of the contemporary circus genre included: [[Circus Oz]], forged in Australia in 1977 from SoapBox Circus (1976) and New Circus (1973);<ref>{{cite book |last1=St Leon |first1=Mark |title=Circus!

The ringmaster presents performers, speaks to the audience, and generally keeps the show moving. The activity of the circus traditionally takes place within a ring; large circuses may have multiple rings, like the six-ringed [[Moscow State Circus]]. A circus often travels with its own band, whose instrumentation in the United States has traditionally included [[brass instrument]]s, drums, [[glockenspiel]], and sometimes the distinctive sound of the [[calliope (music)|calliope]].\n\n===Acts===\n{{See also|List of circus skills}}{{World circus bans}}\nCommon acts include a variety of [[acrobatics]], [[gymnastics]] (including [[Tumbling (gymnastics)|tumbling]] and [[trampoline]]), aerial acts (such as [[trapeze]], [[aerial silk]], [[corde lisse]]), [[contortion]], [[stilts]], and a variety of other routines. [[Juggling]] is one of the most common acts in a circus; the combination of juggling and gymnastics is called [[equilibristics]] and includes acts like [[plate spinning]] and the [[rolling globe]]. Acts like these are some of the most common and the most traditional. [[Clown]]s are common to most circuses and are typically skilled in many circus acts; \"clowns getting into the act\" is a very familiar theme in any circus. Famous circus clowns have included [[Austin Miles]], the [[Fratellini Family]], Rusty Russell, [[Emmett Kelly]], [[Grock]], and [[Bill Irwin]].\n\nDaredevil [[Stunt performer|stunt acts]] and [[sideshow|sideshow acts]] are also parts of some circus acts, these activities may include [[human cannonball]], [[chapeaugraphy]], [[fire eating]], [[Fire breathing|breathing]], and [[Fire dancing|dancing]], [[Impalement arts|knife throwing]], [[Magic (illusion)|magic shows]], [[sword swallowing]], or [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]].

Released in 1953 were ''Man on a Tightrope'' and [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s ''Gycklarnas afton'' (released as ''Sawdust and Tinsel'' in the United States); these were followed by ''Life Is a Circus''; ''Ring of Fear''; ''[[3 Ring Circus]]'' (1954) and ''[[La Strada]]'' (1954), an Oscar-winning film by [[Federico Fellini]] about a girl who is sold to a circus strongman. Fellini made a second film set in the circus called ''[[The Clowns (film)|The Clowns]]'' in 1970. Films about the circus made since 1959 include Disney's ''[[Toby Tyler]]'' (1960), the [[B-movie]] ''[[Circus of Horrors]]'' (also in 1960); the [[musical film]] ''[[Billy Rose's Jumbo (film)|Billy Rose's Jumbo]]'' (1962); ''A Tiger Walks'', a Disney film about a tiger that escapes from the circus; and ''[[Circus World (film)|Circus World]]'' (1964), starring [[John Wayne]].

Barnum]], was released in 2017. \n\nThe TV series ''[[Circus Humberto]]'', based on the novel by [[Eduard Bass]], follows the history of the circus family Humberto between 1826 and 1924. The setting of the HBO television series ''[[Carniv\u00e0le]]'', which ran from 2003 to 2005, is also largely set in a travelling circus. The circus has also inspired many writers. Numerous books, both non-fiction and fiction, have been published about circus life. Notable examples of circus-based fiction include ''[[Circus Humberto]]'' by [[Eduard Bass]], ''[[Cirque du Freak]]'' by [[Darren Shan]], and ''[[Spangle (novel)|Spangle]]'' by [[Gary Jennings]].  The novel ''[[Water for Elephants]]'' by [[Sara Gruen]] tells the fictional tale of a circus veterinarian and was made into a [[Water for Elephants (film)|movie with the same title]], starring [[Robert Pattinson]] and [[Reese Witherspoon]].\n\nCircus is the central theme in comic books of [[Super Commando Dhruva]], an Indian comic book superhero. According to this series, Dhruva was born and brought up in a fictional Indian circus called Jupiter Circus. When a rival circus burnt down Jupiter Circus, killing everyone in it, including Dhruva's parents, Dhruva vowed to become a crime fighter. A circus-based television series called ''[[Circus (TV series)|Circus]]'' was also telecast in India in 1989 on [[DD National]], starring [[Shah Rukh Khan|Shahrukh Khan]] as the lead actor.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Animal training]]\n*[[Chautauqua]], tent shows that preceded American circus\n*[[Circus clown]]\n*[[Clown alley]]\n*[[Circus skills]]\n*[[Cirque du Soleil]]\n*[[Clown]]\n*[[Contemporary circus]]\n*[[Dog and pony show]]\n*[[Flea circus]]\n*[[International Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo]]\n*[[Traveling carnival]]\n*[[Lion taming]]\n*[[List of circuses and circus owners]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n*Assael, Brenda, \"Circus and Victorian Society\", 2005, University of Virginia Press, Charlottesville {{ISBN|0-8139-2340-9}}\n*[[Rupert Croft-Cooke|Croft-Cooke, Rupert]] and Cotes, Peter. 1976.

Refusing to replenish its membership with soldiers who had not fought in the [[Argentine War of Independence]], the regiment disbanded in 1826.\n\nThe second Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers was formed in 1903, and serves as the national ceremonial unit. It claims the original regiment of 1812 as its heritage, but has no direct link or lineage. As a unit, it has never been in combat, although ten members of the regiment were seconded to other units which fought in the Falklands, along with six machine gun detachments attached to the [[Regiment of Patricians|'''1st Infantry Regiment''' ''Los Patricios'']].\n\n==The original Mounted Grenadiers of 1812\u20131826==\nThe original regiment was founded by Argentine national hero [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] in 1812. Its first military action was the [[Battle of San Lorenzo]] (1813). The regiment also played a key role as part of the [[Army of the Andes]] (''Ej\u00e9rcito de los Andes'') in the battles of [[battle of Chacabuco|Chacabuco]] (1817) and [[Battle of Maip\u00fa|Maip\u00fa]] (1818) in Chile. Traveling to Per\u00fa, Ecuador, and Bolivia, the Grenadiers took part in the Battles of [[Battle of Riobamba|Riobamba]], [[Battle of Pichincha|Pichincha]] (1822) and [[Battle of Ayacucho|Ayacucho]] (1824), and in the Cisplatine War. The size of the regiment fell to 120 men and it was disbanded in 1827.\n\n===Raising of the Regiment===\nWhen then Lt. Col. of Cavalry Jose de San Martin arrived on March 9, 1812, the [[First Triumvirate (Argentina)|First Triumvirate]] recognized him for his services as a [[Cavalry]] officer in the [[Spanish Army]]. After studying the Argentine Army's organizational and strategic problems, he offered to put his experiences from the [[Peninsular War]] to use in assisting with the Argentine War for Independence.\n\nOn March 12, the Superior Provisional Government gave an order that recognized and confirmed San Martin's services. The Triumvirate had written to the government asking that San Martin be appointed commander of the Mounted Grenadiers Squadron, which was about to be raised. San Martin set out to form a new cavalry corps that would be patterned after the Swiss Army's Mounted Grenadiers. His goal was to create a unit made up of native soldiers trained in cavalry tactics and mounted combat skills that could effectively support the Argentine Army. Over the next several months, he built what became known as the \"Mounted Grenadiers Squadron\".\n\n===Composition of the Horse Grenadiers Squadron (June 1812)===\nThe new unit was led by two commanders and eight ''officers of cavalry''. Non-commissioned officers and enlisted troops numbered nine cavalry [[sergeant]]s, three cavalry [[corporal]]s, 31 cavalry [[grenadier]]s and one cavalry trumpeter.\n\n'''Officers and commanders of the Squadron'''\n* [[Squadron (army)|Squadron]] [[Commander]]: [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Jose de San Martin\n* Squadron Corporal Major: [[Carlos Maria de Alvear]]\n* [[Adjutant]] Major: Francisco Luzuriaga\n* Guidon Bearer: Manuel Hidalgo\n\n'''1st Cavalry Troop officers'''\n* Cavalry Captain Jose Matias Zapiola\n* Cavalry Lieutenant Justo Bermudez\n* [[Cornet (military rank)|Cornet]] Hipolito Bouchard\n\n'''2nd Cavalry Troop officers'''\n* Cavalry Captain Pedro Vergara\n* Cavalry Lieutenant Agenor Murillio\n* Cornet [[Mariano Necochea]]\n\n===Organization and recruiting===\nThe strict training regimen and rules of conduct established by Jose de San Martin for the Mounted Grenadiers Regiment became a model for the Argentine Army. Rigorous military discipline, especially in maneuvers, training and parade drills were a defining characteristic of the regiment. The ''San Martin Code of Honor'', still used today by the regiment, set out the rules expected to be followed by each member of the Mounted Grenadiers. San Martin used the Code of Honor in recruiting, training, and leading what became an effective fighting force.\n\nBased on the concept of \"leading by example\", in private life as well as military life, the Regiment's Code of Honor included discipline, courage, and a commitment to training. The Code incorporated fourteen specific points, which stated that it was unbecoming of an officer in the regiment:\n#To show cowardice in battle. Even lowering one's head will be considered as such.\n#To not accept a challenge, whether it is just or unjust.\n#To not demand satisfaction when he has been insulted.\n#To not defend, at all costs, the honor of his unit when it has been defamed in his presence or elsewhere.\n#To cheat like a tradesman.\n#To lack integrity in the management of his unit's interests; such as not paying his troops the money that has been provided for them.\n#To speak ill of his comrades to soldiers or officers from other military units.\n#To publicize the discussions held by the officers in their secret meetings.\n#To fraternize with sergeants, corporals and troopers.\n#To lay hands on a woman, even if she has insulted him.\n#To not come to the relief of a comrade who is in danger, when he is able.\n#To be seen in public with women who are known prostitutes.\n#To gamble with low and bawdy people outside of the officer corps.\n#To drink immoderately, in a way that would be prejudicial to the honor of his unit.\n\nSometime later, San Mart\u00edn wrote a short poem honoring his Grenadiers:\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n<poem>\n''De lo que mis Granaderos son capaces,''\n''solo lo s\u00e9 yo.''\n''Quien los iguale habr\u00e1;''\n''quien los exceda, no.''\n</poem>\n{{Col-break}}\n<poem>\n''Of what my Grenadiers are capable,''\n''Only I know.''\n''Who can equal them there will be;''\n''Who can exceed them, not.''\n</poem>\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Development from squadron to regiment===\nAfter a period of recruitment and training, the Second Mounted Grenadiers Squadron was decreed as ready on September 11, 1812, and the Third Mounted Grenadiers Squadron followed in December 1812. By this time, the First Triumvirate had been disbanded as a result of the [[Revolution of October 8, 1812]], which had been supported by the Second Squadron.\n\nSan Martin was given the title of ''Commander of the Mounted Grenadiers''. When the '''Mounted Grenadiers Regiment''' officially came into existence on December 7, 1812, San Martin was promoted to [[Colonel]] and the unit relocated to improved quarters and better stables. Its Fourth Squadron was raised three years later, in 1815.\n\n=== Baptism by fire: the Battle of San Lorenzo (February 3, 1813) ===\n{{Main|Battle of San Lorenzo}}\n\nOn February 3, 1813, the regiment won the only battle of the Argentine War of Independence led by San Martin. The regiment had proceeded to the town of San Lorenzo in Santa Fe on the previous day to stop an advance landing party of 250 Spanish troops from marching on the capital. The regiment was joined by a militia company led by Celedonio Escalada. Setting up camp at a convent in the town, they remained overnight.\n\nAt dawn the next day, the regiment assembled in front of the convent. San Martin mounted, addressed the troops, and ordered his squadrons to set off in two 60-man columns. San Martin led one column; Captain Justo Bermudez, from Uruguay, led the other. The 12 remaining men from the regiment formed a reserve platoon.\n\nSan Martin's troops charged the Spanish battalion, followed by Bermudez bringing up a second charge. San Martin fell from his horse after it was wounded, but was rescued by [[Juan Bautista Cabral]] and [[Juan Bautista Baigorria]], two men from his regiment. Cabral was mortally wounded in the process and San Mart\u00edn reported that Cabral's dying words (in Guarani) were: \"I die happy, we have defeated the enemy\". Moments later, Lieutenant Bouchard killed the Spanish flag bearer, completing the rout of the Spanish forces.\n\nThe battle lasted only 15 minutes, but left 40 Spanish dead and 16 wounded or captured, and 16 Argentine dead and 22 wounded. The Argentine force also seized two cannons.\n\nSan Martin ensured that the Spanish wounded and captured were treated humanely. After having breakfast with the Spanish commander, Antonio Zabala, on February 4, San Martin persuaded the Spanish force to defect to the Argentine cause.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} On his return, San Martin was congratulated by Eastern Bank independence leader Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas on his first victory.\n\nThe Second Triumvirate promoted San Martin to General and gave him command of the Buenos Aires garrison forces.\n\n=== Eastern Bank and the [[Army of the North]] ===\nThe next assignment for the regiment was defense duties in an area that is modern day [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]] along with supporting the Army of the North. The First and Second Squadrons joined the Argentine army in Tucuman in January 1814, remaining in northern Upper Peru until 1816, while the Third and Fourth Squadrons were involved in the campaign of liberation in the Banda Oriental, becoming part of the forces that took the city in June 1814.\n\nIn their performance in the battles for Upper Peru, the 1st and 2nd Squadrons witnessed the events of the [[Yatasto relay]] within days after their arrival.\n\nOn August that same year, 1814, San Martin assumed the office of provincial governor of Cuyo Province fronting the Chilean border, and the Regiment set up its new home in the province the next year with the 3rd and 4th Squadrons moving there, followed in the next year by the 1st and 2nd Squadrons. Assisted by now Lieutenant Colonel Mariano Necochea, the regiment prepared itself for the liberation of Chile from Spanish rule and thus, together with the newly formed mounted rifle squadron with Necochea as its commanding officer, raised with 300 Horse Grenadiers, formed part of the [[Army of the Andes]] with San Martin himself as its commanding general. It rode towards the Chilean border as part of the [[Crossing of the Andes]] in the late summer of 1817, and upon reaching Chile, fought bravely in the [[Battle of Chacabuco]] in February, later distinguishing themselves the following year in the [[Second Battle of Cancha Rayada]] and the [[Battle of Maip\u00fa]]. The regiment, thus, was witness to the [[Chilean Declaration of Independence]] in Santiago on 12 February 1818, one year after the victory in the Chacabuco fields.\n\n==The Mounted Grenadiers of 1903\u2013today==\n[[File:Regimiento de Granaderos a Caballo (Mayor\u00eda).jpg|thumb|300px|Headquarters of the General San Mart\u00edn Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers, located in the [[Palermo, Buenos Aires|Palermo]] section of Buenos Aires. Built in [[Vienna Secession]] style in 1907, it was declared a National Historic Monument in 1997.]]\n\nIn 1903, the Regiment was reinstated and four years later was re-appointed as the Presidential Honor Guard.\n\nThe unit itself has never seen combat ever since, although during the [[Falklands War]] eight conscripts and two first corporals from the regiment were seconded to units in the Falklands and two were wounded in combat. An adhoc troop from the regiment, originally planned for deployment, was placed on reserve in the mainland.\n\n===Role===\nAt present, the regiment acts as the Presidential Honor Guard regiment and fulfills ceremonial protocol functions. It is the caretaker of the [[Casa Rosada]], the Argentine Presidential Palace at the eastern end of the famous [[Plaza de Mayo]].

Refusing to replenish its membership with soldiers who had not fought in the [[Argentine War of Independence]], the regiment disbanded in 1826.\n\nThe second Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers was formed in 1903, and serves as the national ceremonial unit. It claims the original regiment of 1812 as its heritage, but has no direct link or lineage. As a unit, it has never been in combat, although ten members of the regiment were seconded to other units which fought in the Falklands, along with six machine gun detachments attached to the [[Regiment of Patricians|''1st Infantry Regiment'' '''Los Patricios''']].\n\n==The original Mounted Grenadiers of 1812\u20131826==\nThe original regiment was founded by Argentine national hero [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] in 1812. Its first military action was the [[Battle of San Lorenzo]] (1813). The regiment also played a key role as part of the [[Army of the Andes]] (''Ej\u00e9rcito de los Andes'') in the battles of [[battle of Chacabuco|Chacabuco]] (1817) and [[Battle of Maip\u00fa|Maip\u00fa]] (1818) in Chile. Traveling to Per\u00fa, Ecuador, and Bolivia, the Grenadiers took part in the Battles of [[Battle of Riobamba|Riobamba]], [[Battle of Pichincha|Pichincha]] (1822) and [[Battle of Ayacucho|Ayacucho]] (1824), and in the Cisplatine War. The size of the regiment fell to 120 men and it was disbanded in 1827.\n\n===Raising of the Regiment===\nWhen then Lt. Col. of Cavalry Jose de San Martin arrived on March 9, 1812, the [[First Triumvirate (Argentina)|First Triumvirate]] recognized him for his services as a [[Cavalry]] officer in the [[Spanish Army]]. After studying the Argentine Army's organizational and strategic problems, he offered to put his experiences from the [[Peninsular War]] to use in assisting with the Argentine War for Independence.\n\nOn March 12, the Superior Provisional Government gave an order that recognized and confirmed San Martin's services. The Triumvirate had written to the government asking that San Martin be appointed commander of the Mounted Grenadiers Squadron, which was about to be raised. San Martin set out to form a new cavalry corps that would be patterned after the Swiss Army's Mounted Grenadiers. His goal was to create a unit made up of native soldiers trained in cavalry tactics and mounted combat skills that could effectively support the Argentine Army. Over the next several months, he built what became known as the \"Mounted Grenadiers Squadron\".\n\n===Composition of the Horse Grenadiers Squadron (June 1812)===\nThe new unit was led by two commanders and eight ''officers of cavalry''. Non-commissioned officers and enlisted troops numbered nine cavalry [[sergeant]]s, three cavalry [[corporal]]s, 31 cavalry [[grenadier]]s and one cavalry trumpeter.\n\n'''Officers and commanders of the Squadron'''\n* [[Squadron (army)|Squadron]] [[Commander]]: [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Jose de San Martin\n* Squadron Corporal Major: [[Carlos Maria de Alvear]]\n* [[Adjutant]] Major: Francisco Luzuriaga\n* Guidon Bearer: Manuel Hidalgo\n\n'''1st Cavalry Troop officers'''\n* Cavalry Captain Jose Matias Zapiola\n* Cavalry Lieutenant Justo Bermudez\n* [[Cornet (military rank)|Cornet]] Hipolito Bouchard\n\n'''2nd Cavalry Troop officers'''\n* Cavalry Captain Pedro Vergara\n* Cavalry Lieutenant Agenor Murillio\n* Cornet [[Mariano Necochea]]\n\n===Organization and recruiting===\nThe strict training regimen and rules of conduct established by Jose de San Martin for the Mounted Grenadiers Regiment became a model for the Argentine Army. Rigorous military discipline, especially in maneuvers, training and parade drills were a defining characteristic of the regiment. The ''San Martin Code of Honor'', still used today by the regiment, set out the rules expected to be followed by each member of the Mounted Grenadiers. San Martin used the Code of Honor in recruiting, training, and leading what became an effective fighting force.\n\nBased on the concept of \"leading by example\", in private life as well as military life, the Regiment's Code of Honor included discipline, courage, and a commitment to training. The Code incorporated fourteen specific points, which stated that it was unbecoming of an officer in the regiment:\n#To show cowardice in battle. Even lowering one's head will be considered as such.\n#To not accept a challenge, whether it is just or unjust.\n#To not demand satisfaction when he has been insulted.\n#To not defend, at all costs, the honor of his unit when it has been defamed in his presence or elsewhere.\n#To cheat like a tradesman.\n#To lack integrity in the management of his unit's interests; such as not paying his troops the money that has been provided for them.\n#To speak ill of his comrades to soldiers or officers from other military units.\n#To publicize the discussions held by the officers in their secret meetings.\n#To fraternize with sergeants, corporals and troopers.\n#To lay hands on a woman, even if she has insulted him.\n#To not come to the relief of a comrade who is in danger, when he is able.\n#To be seen in public with women who are known prostitutes.\n#To gamble with low and bawdy people outside of the officer corps.\n#To drink immoderately, in a way that would be prejudicial to the honor of his unit.\n\nSometime later, San Mart\u00edn wrote a short poem honoring his Grenadiers:\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n<poem>\n''De lo que mis Granaderos son capaces,''\n''solo lo s\u00e9 yo.''\n''Quien los iguale habr\u00e1;''\n''quien los exceda, no.''\n</poem>\n{{Col-break}}\n<poem>\n''Of what my Grenadiers are capable,''\n''Only I know.''\n''Who can equal them there will be;''\n''Who can exceed them, not.''\n</poem>\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Development from squadron to regiment===\nAfter a period of recruitment and training, the Second Mounted Grenadiers Squadron was decreed as ready on September 11, 1812, and the Third Mounted Grenadiers Squadron followed in December 1812. By this time, the First Triumvirate had been disbanded as a result of the [[Revolution of October 8, 1812]], which had been supported by the Second Squadron.\n\nSan Martin was given the title of ''Commander of the Mounted Grenadiers''. When the '''Mounted Grenadiers Regiment''' officially came into existence on December 7, 1812, San Martin was promoted to [[Colonel]] and the unit relocated to improved quarters and better stables. Its Fourth Squadron was raised three years later, in 1815.\n\n=== Baptism by fire: the Battle of San Lorenzo (February 3, 1813) ===\n{{Main|Battle of San Lorenzo}}\n\nOn February 3, 1813, the regiment won the only battle of the Argentine War of Independence led by San Martin. The regiment had proceeded to the town of San Lorenzo in Santa Fe on the previous day to stop an advance landing party of 250 Spanish troops from marching on the capital. The regiment was joined by a militia company led by Celedonio Escalada. Setting up camp at a convent in the town, they remained overnight.\n\nAt dawn the next day, the regiment assembled in front of the convent. San Martin mounted, addressed the troops, and ordered his squadrons to set off in two 60-man columns. San Martin led one column; Captain Justo Bermudez, from Uruguay, led the other. The 12 remaining men from the regiment formed a reserve platoon.\n\nSan Martin's troops charged the Spanish battalion, followed by Bermudez bringing up a second charge. San Martin fell from his horse after it was wounded, but was rescued by [[Juan Bautista Cabral]] and [[Juan Bautista Baigorria]], two men from his regiment. Cabral was mortally wounded in the process and San Mart\u00edn reported that Cabral's dying words (in Guarani) were: \"I die happy, we have defeated the enemy\". Moments later, Lieutenant Bouchard killed the Spanish flag bearer, completing the rout of the Spanish forces.\n\nThe battle lasted only 15 minutes, but left 40 Spanish dead and 16 wounded or captured, and 16 Argentine dead and 22 wounded. The Argentine force also seized two cannons.\n\nSan Martin ensured that the Spanish wounded and captured were treated humanely. After having breakfast with the Spanish commander, Antonio Zabala, on February 4, San Martin persuaded the Spanish force to defect to the Argentine cause.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} On his return, San Martin was congratulated by Eastern Bank independence leader Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas on his first victory.\n\nThe Second Triumvirate promoted San Martin to General and gave him command of the Buenos Aires garrison forces.\n\n=== Eastern Bank and the [[Army of the North]] ===\nThe next assignment for the regiment was defense duties in an area that is modern day [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]] along with supporting the Army of the North. The First and Second Squadrons joined the Argentine army in Tucuman in January 1814, remaining in northern Upper Peru until 1816, while the Third and Fourth Squadrons were involved in the campaign of liberation in the Banda Oriental, becoming part of the forces that took the city in June 1814.\n\nIn their performance in the battles for Upper Peru, the 1st and 2nd Squadrons witnessed the events of the [[Yatasto relay]] within days after their arrival.\n\nOn August that same year, 1814, San Martin assumed the office of provincial governor of Cuyo Province fronting the Chilean border, and the Regiment set up its new home in the province the next year with the 3rd and 4th Squadrons moving there, followed in the next year by the 1st and 2nd Squadrons. Assisted by now Lieutenant Colonel Mariano Necochea, the regiment prepared itself for the liberation of Chile from Spanish rule and thus, together with the newly formed mounted rifle squadron with Necochea as its commanding officer, raised with 300 Horse Grenadiers, formed part of the [[Army of the Andes]] with San Martin himself as its commanding general. It rode towards the Chilean border as part of the [[Crossing of the Andes]] in the late summer of 1817, and upon reaching Chile, fought bravely in the [[Battle of Chacabuco]] in February, later distinguishing themselves the following year in the [[Second Battle of Cancha Rayada]] and the [[Battle of Maip\u00fa]]. The regiment, thus, was witness to the [[Chilean Declaration of Independence]] in Santiago on 12 February 1818, one year after the victory in the Chacabuco fields.\n\n==The Mounted Grenadiers of 1903\u2013today==\n[[File:Regimiento de Granaderos a Caballo (Mayor\u00eda).jpg|thumb|300px|Headquarters of the General San Mart\u00edn Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers, located in the [[Palermo, Buenos Aires|Palermo]] section of Buenos Aires. Built in [[Vienna Secession]] style in 1907, it was declared a National Historic Monument in 1997.]]\n\nIn 1903, the Regiment was reinstated and four years later was re-appointed as the Presidential Honor Guard.\n\nThe unit itself has never seen combat ever since, although during the [[Falklands War]] eight conscripts and two first corporals from the regiment were seconded to units in the Falklands and two were wounded in combat. An adhoc troop from the regiment, originally planned for deployment, was placed on reserve in the mainland.\n\n===Role===\nAt present, the regiment acts as the Presidential Honor Guard regiment and fulfills ceremonial protocol functions. It is the caretaker of the [[Casa Rosada]], the Argentine Presidential Palace at the eastern end of the famous [[Plaza de Mayo]]. The regiment also takes on ceremonial and security duties at the various residences of the [[President of Argentina]] nationwide.\n\nThe Regiment also mounts guard at the [[Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral]], where its founder's remains are buried, and at the [[Palace of the Argentine National Congress]].\n\n== Structure ==\n{{expand section|date=January 2014}}\n\n=== Organization ===\n*Regimental HQ\n*Alto Peru Fanfare Brass Band\n*Mounted Ceremonial Squadron\n** San Lorenzo Troop\n** Maipo Troop\n** Junin Troop\n** Riobamba Troop\n* Security and Escort Squadron (Dismounted)\n** Ayacucho Troop\n** Chacabuco Troop\n** Montevideo Troop (Training)\n\n===Full [[dress uniform]] and ceremonial weapons===\n[[File:Member of the Regimiento de Granaderos a Caballo General San Mart\u00edn.jpg|thumb|Member of the Regimiento de Granaderos in red uniform]]\n''Officers''\n* Blue [[Shako]] with a Red/Blue [[Pompom]]\n* Blue polo dress/battle uniform and pants\n** Gold Grenade [[badge]]\n** 9 gold [[Button]]s \n** [[Epaulette]] (blue with red piping)\n* Black Leather [[Boot|boots]]\n* Cavalry [[sabre]] belt\n* Cavalry sabre with [[scabbard]]\n\n''Enlisted and NCOs''\n* Red Shako with a Violet pompom\n* Blue polo uniform with gold buttons and a Yellow grenade badge and pants\n** Epaulette (scarlet with red piping)\n* Black leather boots\n* Sabres with scabbards, cavalry [[Carbine]]s (optional), [[lance]]s\n\n===Alto Peru Mounted Fanfare Band===\n[[File:Cambio de Guardia 2.jpg|thumb|Alto Peru Mounted Fanfare Band]]\nEstablished in 1929 as the musical support unit of the Mounted Grenadiers Regiment, this is one of the many military bands in the service of the Argentine Army, and one of the Army's few cavalry mounted bands.
