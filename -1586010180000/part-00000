They were located in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and played their home games at [[Athletic Park (Nashville)|Athletic Park]], later known as Sulphur Dell. \n\nUnder the [[manager (baseball)|management]] of [[Ted Sullivan (baseball)|Ted Sullivan]], the Tigers finished the first series of 1893 in last place out of twelve teams. Their play was hampered by a preponderance of injured players, which led to high roster turnover and the frequent substitution of local amateur players to make out a full lineup. Consequently, the once robust attendance at Athletic Park declined as the season progressed, eventually putting the team in such dire financial condition that Sullivan surrendered the franchise to the league. They fared better in the second series and were in eighth place on August 12 when circuit-wide financial problems forced the to league disband.\n\nReminiscent of the previous year, the 1894 Nashvilles found themselves last out of eight teams just one month into the season. In contrast, manager [[George Stallings]] made a series of roster moves that strengthened the team, enabling it to move up to sixth place by the close of the first series on June 27. On that date, the league was reorganized as a four-team circuit since financial problems had forced half of its teams to drop out. The Tigers played the first [[night game]] in Nashville some 40&nbsp;years before the first [[Major League Baseball]] game was played at night. On July 7, nine games into the second series, Nashville, sitting atop the standings, disbanded as Stallings and other managers sensed the impending total collapse of the league, which occurred on July 11.\n\nA total of 69 players competed in at least one game for Nashville across both seasons. Of these, 40 also played for major league teams. Among the players who went on to have notable major league careers were [[Bill Hoffer]], [[Con Lucid]], [[Dusty Miller (1890s outfielder)|Dusty Miller]], [[John O'Brien (second baseman)|John O'Brien]], [[Bill Phillips (pitcher)|Bill Phillips]], and George Stallings.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Formation ===\n[[File:Kimball-house-1890.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.2|alt=A black and white

Tigers''' were a [[minor league baseball]] team that played in the [[Class B (baseball)|Class B]] [[Southern League (1885\u201399)|Southern League]] from 1893 to 1894. They were located in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and played their home games at [[Athletic Park (Nashville)|Athletic Park]], later known as Sulphur Dell. \n\nUnder the [[manager (baseball)|management]] of [[Ted Sullivan (baseball)|Ted Sullivan]], the Tigers finished the first series of 1893 in last place out of twelve teams. Their play was hampered by a preponderance of injured players, which led to high roster turnover and the frequent substitution of local amateur players to make out a full lineup. Consequently, the once robust attendance at Athletic Park declined as the season progressed, eventually putting the team in such dire financial condition that Sullivan surrendered the franchise to the league. They fared better in the second series and were in eighth place on August 12 when circuit-wide financial problems forced the to league disband.\n\nReminiscent of the previous year, the 1894 Nashvilles found themselves last out of eight teams just one month into the season. In contrast, manager [[George Stallings]] made a series of roster moves that strengthened the team, enabling it to move up to sixth place by the close of the first series on June 27. On that date, the league was reorganized as a four-team circuit since financial problems had forced half of its teams to drop out. The Tigers played the first [[night game]] in Nashville some 40&nbsp;years before the first [[Major League Baseball]] game was played at night. On July 7, nine games into the second series, Nashville, sitting atop the standings, disbanded as Stallings and other managers sensed the impending total collapse of the league, which occurred on July 11.\n\nA total of 69 players competed in at least one game for Nashville across both seasons. Of these, 40 also played for major league teams. Among the players who went on to have notable major league careers were [[Bill Hoffer]], [[Con Lucid]], [[Dusty Miller (1890s outfielder)|Dusty Miller]], [[John O'Brien (second baseman)|John O'Brien]], [[Bill Phillips (pitcher)|Bill Phillips]], and George Stallings.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Formation ===\n[[File:Kimball-house-1890.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.2|alt=A black and white

The campus of Jacksonville State University in Jacksonville, Alabama is approximately ten miles south of Piedmont via AL-21. \n\nThe city is located in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountain chain and is surrounded by mountains on the city's southern and eastern sides. The area is home to Duggar Mountain, which is Alabama's second highest point, only trailing Mt. Cheaha by a small margin. Piedmont is a popular tourist destination for outdoor enthusiasts due to its close proximity to many nearby hiking trails, streams and rivers, mountains, the Duggar Mountain Wilderness, the Talladega National Forrest and Coleman Lake. Weiss Lake is fourteen miles north of Piedmont via AL-9 and is known as \"the Crappie Capital of the World.\" Piedmont is home to Terrapin Creek, which is a popular destination for kayaking, canoeing, camping, swimming and fishing. Each year, particularly in the summer, thousands of people visit Piedmont and the surrounding areas due to the recreational opportunities and natural beauty the area is known for. Piedmont is also home to the Chief Ladiga Trail, which is a paved trail for walking, jogging and bicycling. The trail runs through downtown Piedmont and runs all the way to Atlanta to the east, and to Anniston, Alabama to the south and west. \n\nTwo state highways, AL-9 and AL-21, run through the city limits of Piedmont, as well as US Highway 278. The city and surrounding area is served by the Centre-Piedmont-Cherokee County Regional Airport, which was constructed in 2010. Many surrounding communities are served by the 36272 ZIP code, including Spring Garden, [[Rock Run, Alabama|Rock Run]], Knighten's Crossroads, and [[Nances Creek, Alabama|Nance's Creek]]. \n\nThe current mayor is Bill Baker, who was chosen by the city council to lead after elected mayor Rick Freeman resigned due to medical issues.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Founding and early growth ===\nThe area now known as Piedmont is a community that began in the early 1840s, located at the crossroads of two early [[post road]]s. Major Jacob Forney Dailey of [[North Carolina]] came to Alabama in 1848 and bought land in present-day Piedmont. Major Dailey named the area Cross Plains, and an official post office with that name was established on September 22, 1851.\n\nThe Standard Coosa-Thatcher Cotton Mill was established in Piedmont in the late 1800s and was the main source of employment in and around the city for nearly a century. After being named \"Hollow Stump\" and \"Cross Plains\" local residents settled for the name Piedmont in 1888. The word Piedmont means \"Foot of the mountains\" which was more appealing to local residents since the city was surrounded by lots of mountainous scenery and natural beauty. \n\n==Transportation==\n* AL Hwy 21\n* US Hwy 278\n* AL Hwy 9 \n*Vigo Rd (Vital East/West route from the end of East Ladiga St in downtown Piedmont, leading to Borden Springs Alabama and Polk County/Cedartown Georgia to the East)\n\nElderly residents of the city have access to public transportation via the City of Piedmont's public transportation buses.\n\n=== Recent history ===\nThe [[Standard Coosa-Thatcher Company]] was a textile corporation founded in Piedmont in 1891. It was publicly traded beginning in 1922.<ref>''Standard-Coosa To Be Acquired'', [[New York Times]], April 15, 1982, pg.

A [[tribal chief]], he worked as a medical aide, union leader and planter before being elected to the [[Parliament of France|French Parliament]]. He served in several ministerial positions within the [[Cabinet of France|French government]] before leading C\u00f4te d'Ivoire following independence in 1960. Throughout his life, he played a significant role in politics and the [[decolonization of Africa]].\n\nUnder Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny's politically [[Centrism|moderate]] leadership, Ivory Coast prospered economically. This success, uncommon in poverty-ridden West Africa, became known as the \"Ivorian miracle\"; it was due to a combination of sound planning, the maintenance of strong ties with [[Western world|the West]] (particularly France) and development of the country's significant coffee and cocoa industries. However, reliance on the agricultural sector caused difficulties in 1980, after a sharp drop in the prices of coffee and cocoa.\n\nThroughout his presidency, Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny maintained a close relationship with France, a policy known as [[Fran\u00e7afrique]], and he built a close friendship with [[Jacques Foccart]], the chief adviser on African policy in the [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]] and [[Georges Pompidou|Pompidou]] governments. He aided the conspirators who ousted [[Kwame Nkrumah]] from power in [[Ghana]] in 1966, took part in [[1977 Benin coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|the failed coup]] against [[Mathieu K\u00e9r\u00e9kou]] in [[Benin]] in 1977, was suspected of involvement in the [[1987 Burkinab\u00e9 coup d'\u00e9tat|1987 coup d'\u00e9tat]] that removed [[Thomas Sankara]] from power in [[Burkina Faso]] and provided assistance to [[UNITA]], a United States-supported, anti-communist rebel movement in [[Angola]]. Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny maintained a strong [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] foreign policy, which resulted in, among other things, severing [[Ivory Coast\u2013Soviet Union relations|diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union]] in 1969 (after first establishing relations in 1967) and refusing to recognise the [[People's Republic of China]] until 1983. He re-established relations with the Soviet Union in 1986.\n\nIn the West, Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny was commonly known as the \"Sage of Africa\" or the \"Grand Old Man of Africa\". Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny moved the country's capital from [[Abidjan]] to his hometown of [[Yamoussoukro]] and built the world's largest church there, the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Peace of Yamoussoukro]], at a cost of US$300&nbsp;million. At the time of his death, he was the longest-serving leader in Africa's history and the third longest-serving leader in the world after [[Fidel Castro]] of [[Cuba]] and [[Kim Il-sung]] of [[North Korea]]. In 1989, [[UNESCO]] created the [[F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny Peace Prize]] for the \"safeguarding, maintaining and seeking of peace\". After his death, conditions in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire quickly deteriorated. Between 1994 and 2002, there were a number of coups, a [[currency devaluation]] and an economic recession; a [[First Ivorian Civil War|civil war]] began in 2002.\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Birth, childhood and education===\n[[Image:C\u00f4te d'Ivoire map.png|thumb|right|Map of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]]\nAccording to his official biography, Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny was probably born on 18 October 1908, in [[Yamoussoukro]] to a family of hereditary chiefs of the [[Baoul\u00e9 people|Baoul\u00e9]] people.<ref name=assemblee>{{cite web |title=Biographies des d\u00e9put\u00e9s de la IV R\u00e9publique: F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny |url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/biographies/IVRepublique/houphouet-boigny-felix-18101905.asp |publisher=[[National Assembly of France]] |accessdate=17 July 2008 |language=fr}}</ref> Unofficial accounts, however, place his birth date up to seven years earlier.<ref name=leaderfreedom/><ref name=rvx>{{cite AV media|people=Pesnot, Patrick (producer), Michele Billoud (director)|title=Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny Part 1|date=9 April 2005|medium=radio|publisher=[[France Inter]]|url=http://www.radiofrance.fr/franceinter/em/rendezvousavecx/index.php?id=32381|language=fr}}{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref> Born into the [[animism|animist]] Akou\u00e8s tribe, he was named Dia Houphou\u00ebt: his first name ''Dia'' means \"prophet\" or \"magician\".

On the 24th of that same month, Boigny delivered a statement in the Assembly contesting the result of the elections, which he declared tainted by fraud.

A [[tribal chief]], he worked as a medical aide, union leader and planter before being elected to the [[Parliament of France|French Parliament]]. He served in several ministerial positions within the [[Cabinet of France|French government]] before leading C\u00f4te d'Ivoire following independence in 1960. Throughout his life, he played a significant role in politics and the [[decolonization of Africa]].\n\nUnder Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny's politically [[Centrism|moderate]] leadership, Ivory Coast prospered economically. This success, uncommon in poverty-ridden West Africa, became known as the \"Ivorian miracle\"; it was due to a combination of sound planning, the maintenance of strong ties with [[Western world|the West]] (particularly France) and development of the country's significant coffee and cocoa industries. However, reliance on the agricultural sector caused difficulties in 1980, after a sharp drop in the prices of coffee and cocoa.\n\nThroughout his presidency, Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny maintained a close relationship with France, a policy known as [[Fran\u00e7afrique]], and he built a close friendship with [[Jacques Foccart]], the chief adviser on African policy in the [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]] and [[Georges Pompidou|Pompidou]] governments. He aided the conspirators who ousted [[Kwame Nkrumah]] from power in [[Ghana]] in 1966, took part in [[1977 Benin coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|the failed coup]] against [[Mathieu K\u00e9r\u00e9kou]] in [[Benin]] in 1977, was suspected of involvement in the [[1987 Burkinab\u00e9 coup d'\u00e9tat|1987 coup d'\u00e9tat]] that removed [[Thomas Sankara]] from power in [[Burkina Faso]] and provided assistance to [[UNITA]], a United States-supported, anti-communist rebel movement in [[Angola]]. Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny maintained a strong [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] foreign policy, which resulted in, among other things, severing [[Ivory Coast\u2013Soviet Union relations|diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union]] in 1969 (after first establishing relations in 1967) and refusing to recognise the [[People's Republic of China]] until 1983. He re-established relations with the Soviet Union in 1986.\n\nIn the West, Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny was commonly known as the \"Sage of Africa\" or the \"Grand Old Man of Africa\". Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny moved the country's capital from [[Abidjan]] to his hometown of [[Yamoussoukro]] and built the world's largest church there, the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Peace of Yamoussoukro]], at a cost of US$300&nbsp;million. At the time of his death, he was the longest-serving leader in Africa's history and the third longest-serving leader in the world after [[Fidel Castro]] of [[Cuba]] and [[Kim Il-sung]] of [[North Korea]]. In 1989, [[UNESCO]] created the [[F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny Peace Prize]] for the \"safeguarding, maintaining and seeking of peace\". After his death, conditions in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire quickly deteriorated.

On the 24th of that same month, Boigny delivered a statement in the Assembly contesting the result of the elections, which he declared tainted by fraud. He also denounced what he saw as the exploitation of overseas deputies as \"voting machines\", who, as political pawns, supported the colonial government's every action.<ref name=assemblee/> Thereafter, Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny and the RDA were briefly unsuccessful before their success was renewed in 1956;<ref name=decolo/> at [[1956 French legislative election|that year's elections]], the party received {{formatnum:502711}} of {{formatnum:579550}} votes cast.

The president's funeral featured many traditional African funerary customs, including a large chorus dressed in bright batik dresses singing \"laagoh budji gnia\" ([[Baoul\u00e9 language|Baoul\u00e9]]: \"Lord, it is you who has made all things\") and village chiefs displaying strips of [[kente]] and korhogo cloth.

However, according to ''[[The New York Times]]'', many Ivorians were disappointed by the poor attendance of several key allies, most notably the United States.

The city lies on the Indian Ocean coast, largely between the [[Buffalo River (Eastern Cape)|Buffalo River]] and the [[Nahoon River]], and hosts the country's only [[river port]]. {{As of|2011}}, East London had a population of over 267,000 with over 755,000 in the metropolitan area.<ref>[http://census2011.adrianfrith.com/place/260 Census 2011 \u2014 Metropolitan Municipality \u201cBuffalo City\u201d].

Retrieved on 18 October 2015.</ref>\n\n== History ==\nJohn Bailie, one of the [[1820 Settlers]], surveyed the [[Buffalo River (Eastern Cape)|Buffalo River]] mouth and founded the town in 1836. There is a memorial on Signal Hill commemorating the event.<ref>''The Story of the British Settlers of 1820 in South Africa'' \u2013 H. E. Hockly (Juta & Co., 1948)</ref>\nThe city formed around the only river port in South Africa and was originally known as Port Rex. Later it was renamed London in honour of the capital city of Great Britain, hence the name East London. This settlement on the West Bank was the nucleus of the town of East London, which was elevated to city status in 1914.\n\nDuring the early to mid-19th century frontier wars between the [[British settlers]] and the local [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] inhabitants, East London served as a supply port to service the military headquarters at nearby [[King William's Town]], about {{convert|50|km}} away. A British [[fort]], Fort Glamorgan, was built on the West Bank in 1847, and annexed to the [[Cape Colony]] that same year. This fort is one of a series of British-built forts, including Fort Murray, [[Fort White, Eastern Cape|Fort White]], [[Fort Cox, Eastern Cape|Fort Cox]], [[Fort Hare]], Fort Jackson and [[Fort Beaufort]], in the border area that became known as [[British Kaffraria]].\n\nWith later development of the port came the settlement of permanent residents, including German settlers, most of whom were bachelors. These settlers were responsible for German names of some towns in the vicinity of East London such as [[Stutterheim, Eastern Cape|Stutterheim]] and [[Berlin, Eastern Cape|Berlin]]. Today, German surnames such as Gehring, Salzwedel and Peinke are still common in East London, but the descendants of the settlers rapidly became Anglicised.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe existing port, in the mouth of the Buffalo River, adjoining the Indian Ocean, began operating in 1870. In 1872, the [[Cape Colony]], under the leadership of its first Prime Minister [[John Charles Molteno|John Molteno]], attained a degree of independence from Britain. The new government merged the three neighbouring settlements of East London, East London East and Panmure in 1873, forming the core of the current municipality, and in 1876 it began construction on the region's [[Cape Government Railways|railway lines]], commencing on the river's east bank. At the same time, it began construction of the East London harbour. This new infrastructure rapidly accelerated development of the area into today's thriving city of East London.<ref>Burman, Jose (1984). ''Early Railways at the Cape''. Cape Town.

Chapter 19, ''The Makers of Railways: John Molteno''. p.170.</ref>\n\nThe unusual double-decker bridge over the Buffalo River was completed in 1935, and to this day is the only bridge of its type in South Africa. Modern day attractions include the Gately House, City Hall, Cape Railways, Nahoon Museum, [[East London Museum]] housing the [[coelacanth]], a prehistoric fish, thought to be extinct, discovered live at the [[Chalumna River]] mouth near East London by fishermen in 1938,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.saiab.ac.za/index.php?pid=11 |publisher=The South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity |title= Historical Highlights |quote=JLB Smith, a Chemistry Professor at Rhodes University, publishes his description of Latimeria chalumnae |date=14 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918165927/http://www.saiab.ac.za/index.php?pid=11 |archive-date=18 September 2008}}</ref> and numerous memorial statues.\n\n== Governance  ==\n\n=== Residential segregation in East London during apartheid ===\n\nIn 1948 the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] came to power in [[South Africa]], and began to implement the policy of [[apartheid]]. Apartheid as a doctrine envisaged the total segregation of races in [[South Africa]], and East London was no different. In 1950, the [[Group Areas Act]] was placed upon the statute books making absolute segregation in all urban areas mandatory. In 1951, the Land Tenure Advisory Board, the body created to enforce the act, conducted initial investigations into the reallocation of space along racial lines in East London. Residential segregration had long been practised in East London prior to the advent of apartheid. In 1941, the East London Municipality moved residents from East Bank townships to the newly built township of [[Duncan Village]].<ref name=\"EastLondon\">{{cite book | title= The Making of Territorial Apartheid : The Case of East London's Locations| url=http://wiredspace.wits.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10539/8033/HWS-308.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y| accessdate=29 November 2017|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nIn 1951, all inter-racial property exchanges were prohibited in East London. In 1955, the Amalinda area was zoned as a White Group Area by Government Gazette Proclamation number 21. This meant that the municipality's plans to extend the area in order to accommodate the black African population were abandoned.<ref name=\"EastLondon\"/> In 1953, residents in the East Bank were forcibly moved to the new township of [[Mdantsane]].<ref name=\"EastLondon2\">{{cite book | title= Mdantsane| url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/archive/introduction-mdantsane| accessdate=29 November 2017|format=PDF}}</ref> In February 1966, the [[apartheid]] [[South Africa]]n government defined [[Mdantsane]] as a separate [[homeland]] township. In 1956, [[South Africa|South African]] President [[Henrik Verwoerd]], who was the archarchitect of apartheid, forbade the East London municipality from extending the existing [[Duncan Village]] township and sanctioned the building of [[Mdantsane]].<ref name=\"EastLondon\"/>\n\nIn 1961, these plans provided for the allocation of a distinct wedge of the city for [[Indian South Africans|Asian]] and [[Coloured]] residence, which \"incorporated the areas of North End and the recently proclaimed Buffalo Flats location. This plan occasioned tremendous resentment in the city prompting petitions and letters of complaint from numerous organisations including the [[Black Sash]], trade unions and various black community groups. In 1967, the East London Municipality proclaimed the majority of the city an area for white occupancy, with the exception of a broad sector of land encompassing the Parkside, Parkridge and Buffalo Flats areas which was zoned for coloured residence. Certain parts of [[Duncan Village]] were disestablished and its African residents removed, new coloured and Asian locations were built and proclaimed upon land in 1973. In the same year, the newly-constructed location of Braelynn was proclaimed an Indian area while Buffalo Flats Extension and Pefferville were proclaimed as coloured areas. The construction/ extension of coloured areas and the Duncan Village were suspended in 1983.<ref name=\"EastLondon\"/>\n\nAt the end of apartheid in 1994, East London became part of the province of [[Eastern Cape]]. In 2000, East London became part of [[Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality]], also consisting of [[King William's Town]], [[Bhisho]] and [[Mdantsane]] and is the seat of the Metro.\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:East London Airport, South Africa.jpg|thumb|East London Airport]]\nEast London is the second largest industrial centre in the province. The motor industry is the dominant employer. A major [[Daimler AG|Daimler]] plant is located next to the harbour, manufacturing [[Mercedes-Benz]] and other vehicles for the local market, as well as exporting to the United States and [[Brazil]]. Other industries include clothing, textiles, pharmaceuticals and food processing.\n\nThe period of international sanctions that followed in the 1980s damaged the economy of East London's harbour. Enormous investment in recent years, by corporations such as [[Daimler AG]], has resulted in the harbour being developed to include a new car terminal.\n\nFrom the 1960s until the 1990s, the [[apartheid]] government created tax and wage incentives to attract industries to the then black \"independent states\", including nearby [[Ciskei]]. Investment thus flowed into surrounding areas such as Fort Jackson and [[Dimbaza]], leaving East London in relative isolation. Transport infrastructure deteriorated and port activity wound down.{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\nTo encourage investment in East London, the East London Industrial Development Zone (IDZ) was established on the West Bank in 2004, close to both the port and airport. 1500ha of land has been made available, and the site is one of four duty-free development areas in South Africa.\n\nEast London has good transport links with the rest of South Africa. The [[N2 (South Africa)|N2]] highway connecting [[Cape Town]] and [[Durban]] bypasses the city, while the [[N6 (South Africa)|N6]] highway joins East London with the inland city of [[Bloemfontein]] (as well as, via the [[N1 (South Africa)|N1]], Johannesburg). [[East London Airport]], 10&nbsp;km from the city centre, has daily flights to all major South African cities.\n\n== Sports ==\n{{sources|section|date=December 2018}}\n[[Cricket]] is very popular around East London. A combined Border/Eastern Province cricket side known as the [[Warriors cricket team|Warriors]] take part in the top provincial competition. Former Proteas wicketkeeper [[Mark Boucher]] who currently holds the Test record for most dismissals by a wicketkeeper hails from East London. [[Buffalo Park]] Stadium in East London hosted a match during the [[ICC Cricket World Cup]] in 2003 and two matches of the [[2009 Indian Premier League]].\n\nThe Buffalo Road Running Club of East London has created two established events that have gained international recognition. They are the Old Mutual Buffalo 42,2&nbsp;km marathon, which is held in February/March each year, and South Africa's oldest 160&nbsp;km extreme ultra marathon, the Washie, over a picturesque and undulating coastal route from Port Alfred to the city.\n\n[[Triathlon]] is a popular sport and in particular the world-famous [[Ironman 70.3]] South African event that takes place annually in January. Ironman 70.3 consists of a 1.9&nbsp;km swim, 90&nbsp;km of cycling and a 21.1&nbsp;km road run. The event starts and finishes at Orient Beach in East London.\n\n[[Rugby union|Rugby]] is popular in East London. The provincial team, the [[Border Bulldogs]], currently plays in the First Division of the [[Currie Cup]] competition. Most national games in East London are played at the [[Buffalo City Stadium]], which holds around 15000 people and was a host stadium during the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]]. East London schools have produced many fine rugby players, including (in recent times) [[Andr\u00e9 Vos]], Keith and [[Mark Andrews (rugby player)|Mark Andrews]], [[Christiaan Scholtz]], [[Brent Russell]], [[Rory Kockott]], [[Akona Ndungane]] and [[Odwa Ndungane]].\n\n[[Association football|Football]] is also very popular in the city. East London is home to [[Blackburn Rovers FC (South Africa)|Blackburn Rovers]], a football club competing in the [[National First Division]]. The team plays at [[Buffalo City Stadium]].\n\n[[Motocross]] is also popular and many national events are held in the area surrounding East London, due to the challenging terrain there and in [[Transkei]]. East London is home to the ELMCC (East London Motor Cycle Club), which organises most of the motorcycle events in the area.\n\nEast London is home to the [[Prince George Circuit|Prince George Race Circuit]], opened in 1959 (renamed East London Grand Prix Circuit), a historic motor racing track that hosted three [[Formula One]] [[South African Grand Prix]] during the 1930s and 1960s. The circuit is run and managed by Border Motor Sport Club on a shoestring budget. South Africa's only [[Formula One]] [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|World Drivers' Champion]], [[Jody Scheckter]], started his motor racing career with a Renault Gordini on this track.\n\nGolf is another favoured pastime in and around East London. East London Golf Club is a highly regarded championship golf course and is currently ranked No 12 in Golf Digest's Top 100 courses. Some of the other golf clubs in the region are the West Bank Golf Club, Gonubie Golf Club, Olivewood Golf Estate and Fish River Sun Country Club (a [[Gary Player]]-designed golf course). East London has also hosted the Africa Open tournament multiple times.Golfers can also hone their skills at the East London Golf Club Driving Range.\n\nMartial arts are also very popular, with numerous clubs available for training in [[aikido]], judo, [[karate]], [[T'ai chi ch'uan|t'ai chi]] and many other forms of martial arts. The East London Aikido Club is taught by a [[dan (rank)|3rd dan]] local instructor who has trained under a number of international instructors in South Africa and overseas. Club members of the East London Aikido Club regularly represent their club at national aikido events. Fort Hare Karate and East London Goju Kai have also hosted many memorable events and training weekends.\n\n[[Rowing]] is on the Buffalo River.

There is a memorial on Signal Hill commemorating the event.<ref>''The Story of the British Settlers of 1820 in South Africa'' \u2013 H. E. Hockly (Juta & Co., 1948)</ref>\nThe city formed around the only river port in South Africa and was originally known as Port Rex. Later it was renamed London in honour of the capital city of Great Britain, hence the name East London. This settlement on the West Bank was the nucleus of the town of East London, which was elevated to city status in 1914.\n\nDuring the early to mid-19th century frontier wars between the [[British settlers]] and the local [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] inhabitants, East London served as a supply port to service the military headquarters at nearby [[King William's Town]], about {{convert|50|km}} away. A British [[fort]], Fort Glamorgan, was built on the West Bank in 1847, and annexed to the [[Cape Colony]] that same year. This fort is one of a series of British-built forts, including Fort Murray, [[Fort White, Eastern Cape|Fort White]], [[Fort Cox, Eastern Cape|Fort Cox]], [[Fort Hare]], Fort Jackson and [[Fort Beaufort]], in the border area that became known as [[British Kaffraria]].\n\nWith later development of the port came the settlement of permanent residents, including German settlers, most of whom were bachelors. These settlers were responsible for German names of some towns in the vicinity of East London such as [[Stutterheim, Eastern Cape|Stutterheim]] and [[Berlin, Eastern Cape|Berlin]]. Today, German surnames such as Gehring, Salzwedel and Peinke are still common in East London, but the descendants of the settlers rapidly became Anglicised.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe existing port, in the mouth of the Buffalo River, adjoining the Indian Ocean, began operating in 1870. In 1872, the [[Cape Colony]], under the leadership of its first Prime Minister [[John Charles Molteno|John Molteno]], attained a degree of independence from Britain. The new government merged the three neighbouring settlements of East London, East London East and Panmure in 1873, forming the core of the current municipality, and in 1876 it began construction on the region's [[Cape Government Railways|railway lines]], commencing on the river's east bank. At the same time, it began construction of the East London harbour. This new infrastructure rapidly accelerated development of the area into today's thriving city of East London.<ref>Burman, Jose (1984). ''Early Railways at the Cape''. Cape Town.

Apartheid as a doctrine envisaged the total segregation of races in [[South Africa]], and East London was no different. In 1950, the [[Group Areas Act]] was placed upon the statute books making absolute segregation in all urban areas mandatory. In 1951, the Land Tenure Advisory Board, the body created to enforce the act, conducted initial investigations into the reallocation of space along racial lines in East London. Residential segregration had long been practised in East London prior to the advent of apartheid. In 1941, the East London Municipality moved residents from East Bank townships to the newly built township of [[Duncan Village]].<ref name=\"EastLondon\">{{cite book | title= The Making of Territorial Apartheid : The Case of East London's Locations| url=http://wiredspace.wits.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10539/8033/HWS-308.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y| accessdate=29 November 2017|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nIn 1951, all inter-racial property exchanges were prohibited in East London. In 1955, the Amalinda area was zoned as a White Group Area by Government Gazette Proclamation number 21. This meant that the municipality's plans to extend the area in order to accommodate the black African population were abandoned.<ref name=\"EastLondon\"/> In 1953, residents in the East Bank were forcibly moved to the new township of [[Mdantsane]].<ref name=\"EastLondon2\">{{cite book | title= Mdantsane| url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/archive/introduction-mdantsane| accessdate=29 November 2017|format=PDF}}</ref> In February 1966, the [[apartheid]] [[South Africa]]n government defined [[Mdantsane]] as a separate [[homeland]] township. In 1956, [[South Africa|South African]] President [[Henrik Verwoerd]], who was the archarchitect of apartheid, forbade the East London municipality from extending the existing [[Duncan Village]] township and sanctioned the building of [[Mdantsane]].<ref name=\"EastLondon\"/>\n\nIn 1961, these plans provided for the allocation of a distinct wedge of the city for [[Indian South Africans|Asian]] and [[Coloured]] residence, which \"incorporated the areas of North End and the recently proclaimed Buffalo Flats location. This plan occasioned tremendous resentment in the city prompting petitions and letters of complaint from numerous organisations including the [[Black Sash]], trade unions and various black community groups. In 1967, the East London Municipality proclaimed the majority of the city an area for white occupancy, with the exception of a broad sector of land encompassing the Parkside, Parkridge and Buffalo Flats areas which was zoned for coloured residence. Certain parts of [[Duncan Village]] were disestablished and its African residents removed, new coloured and Asian locations were built and proclaimed upon land in 1973. In the same year, the newly-constructed location of Braelynn was proclaimed an Indian area while Buffalo Flats Extension and Pefferville were proclaimed as coloured areas. The construction/ extension of coloured areas and the Duncan Village were suspended in 1983.<ref name=\"EastLondon\"/>\n\nAt the end of apartheid in 1994, East London became part of the province of [[Eastern Cape]]. In 2000, East London became part of [[Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality]], also consisting of [[King William's Town]], [[Bhisho]] and [[Mdantsane]] and is the seat of the Metro.\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:East London Airport, South Africa.jpg|thumb|East London Airport]]\nEast London is the second largest industrial centre in the province. The motor industry is the dominant employer. A major [[Daimler AG|Daimler]] plant is located next to the harbour, manufacturing [[Mercedes-Benz]] and other vehicles for the local market, as well as exporting to the United States and [[Brazil]]. Other industries include clothing, textiles, pharmaceuticals and food processing.\n\nThe period of international sanctions that followed in the 1980s damaged the economy of East London's harbour. Enormous investment in recent years, by corporations such as [[Daimler AG]], has resulted in the harbour being developed to include a new car terminal.\n\nFrom the 1960s until the 1990s, the [[apartheid]] government created tax and wage incentives to attract industries to the then black \"independent states\", including nearby [[Ciskei]]. Investment thus flowed into surrounding areas such as Fort Jackson and [[Dimbaza]], leaving East London in relative isolation. Transport infrastructure deteriorated and port activity wound down.{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\nTo encourage investment in East London, the East London Industrial Development Zone (IDZ) was established on the West Bank in 2004, close to both the port and airport. 1500ha of land has been made available, and the site is one of four duty-free development areas in South Africa.\n\nEast London has good transport links with the rest of South Africa. The [[N2 (South Africa)|N2]] highway connecting [[Cape Town]] and [[Durban]] bypasses the city, while the [[N6 (South Africa)|N6]] highway joins East London with the inland city of [[Bloemfontein]] (as well as, via the [[N1]], Johannesburg). [[East London Airport]], 10&nbsp;km from the city centre, has daily flights to all major South African cities.\n\n== Sports ==\n{{sources|section|date=December 2018}}\n[[Cricket]] is very popular around East London. A combined Border/Eastern Province cricket side known as the [[Warriors cricket team|Warriors]] take part in the top provincial competition. Former Proteas wicketkeeper [[Mark Boucher]] who currently holds the Test record for most dismissals by a wicketkeeper hails from East London. [[Buffalo Park]] Stadium in East London hosted a match during the [[ICC Cricket World Cup]] in 2003 and two matches of the [[2009 Indian Premier League]].\n\nThe Buffalo Road Running Club of East London has created two established events that have gained international recognition. They are the Old Mutual Buffalo 42,2&nbsp;km marathon, which is held in February/March each year, and South Africa's oldest 160&nbsp;km extreme ultra marathon, the Washie, over a picturesque and undulating coastal route from Port Alfred to the city.\n\n[[Triathlon]] is a popular sport and in particular the world-famous [[Ironman 70.3]] South African event that takes place annually in January. Ironman 70.3 consists of a 1.9&nbsp;km swim, 90&nbsp;km of cycling and a 21.1&nbsp;km road run. The event starts and finishes at Orient Beach in East London.\n\n[[Rugby union|Rugby]] is popular in East London. The provincial team, the [[Border Bulldogs]], currently plays in the First Division of the [[Currie Cup]] competition. Most national games in East London are played at the [[Buffalo City Stadium]], which holds around 15000 people and was a host stadium during the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]]. East London schools have produced many fine rugby players, including (in recent times) [[Andr\u00e9 Vos]], Keith and [[Mark Andrews (rugby player)|Mark Andrews]], [[Christiaan Scholtz]], [[Brent Russell]], [[Rory Kockott]], [[Akona Ndungane]] and [[Odwa Ndungane]].\n\n[[Association football|Football]] is also very popular in the city. East London is home to [[Blackburn Rovers FC (South Africa)|Blackburn Rovers]], a football club competing in the [[National First Division]]. The team plays at [[Buffalo City Stadium]].\n\n[[Motocross]] is also popular and many national events are held in the area surrounding East London, due to the challenging terrain there and in [[Transkei]]. East London is home to the ELMCC (East London Motor Cycle Club), which organises most of the motorcycle events in the area.\n\nEast London is home to the [[Prince George Circuit|Prince George Race Circuit]], opened in 1959 (renamed East London Grand Prix Circuit), a historic motor racing track that hosted three [[Formula One]] [[South African Grand Prix]] during the 1930s and 1960s. The circuit is run and managed by Border Motor Sport Club on a shoestring budget. South Africa's only [[Formula One]] [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|World Drivers' Champion]], [[Jody Scheckter]], started his motor racing career with a Renault Gordini on this track.\n\nGolf is another favoured pastime in and around East London. East London Golf Club is a highly regarded championship golf course and is currently ranked No 12 in Golf Digest's Top 100 courses. Some of the other golf clubs in the region are the West Bank Golf Club, Gonubie Golf Club, Olivewood Golf Estate and Fish River Sun Country Club (a [[Gary Player]]-designed golf course). East London has also hosted the Africa Open tournament multiple times.Golfers can also hone their skills at the East London Golf Club Driving Range.\n\nMartial arts are also very popular, with numerous clubs available for training in [[aikido]], judo, [[karate]], [[T'ai chi ch'uan|t'ai chi]] and many other forms of martial arts. The East London Aikido Club is taught by a [[dan (rank)|3rd dan]] local instructor who has trained under a number of international instructors in South Africa and overseas. Club members of the East London Aikido Club regularly represent their club at national aikido events. Fort Hare Karate and East London Goju Kai have also hosted many memorable events and training weekends.\n\n[[Rowing]] is on the Buffalo River. The annual Buffalo Regatta began in 1881 and has become the largest in South Africa: in 2018 there were 1000 competitors participating in 200 events over three days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://elba.org.za/buffalo-regatta/|title=Buffalo Regatta|date=9 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Surf ski|Surfski]] is ideally suited to East London.

Although it has no true dry season, there is a drying trend in the winter, with the wettest times of year being spring and autumn. There is also a shorter and lesser dry period in December and January. \n\nThe all-time record low is {{convert|3|C|1}}, and the all-time record high is {{convert|42|C|1}}. The hottest temperatures have been recorded in springtime, rather than the summer months. Temperatures above {{convert|38|C|0}} have only been recorded early in the season, from August to December. [[Berg wind|Berg winds]] contribute to these high temperatures, as already warm air from the arid interior is further heated through compression as it drops over the escarpment to sea level. Although temperatures have never dropped below freezing since records began, East London has recorded snowfall in 1985 and 1989.<ref name=\"East London Historical Weather Records\">{{cite web |url = http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/East_London/688580.htm |title = East London Historical Weather Records |accessdate = 25 February 2012 |publisher=TuTiempo.net}}</ref>\n\n<div style=\"width:90%\">\n{{Weather box\n|location = East London (1961\u20131990, extremes 1939\u20131990)\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 36.4\n|Feb record high C = 42.6\n|Mar record high C = 38.6\n|Apr record high C = 35.9\n|May record high C = 37.0\n|Jun record high C = 32.8\n|Jul record high C = 34.3\n|Aug record high C = 37.5\n|Sep record high C = 41.7\n|Oct record high C = 40.9\n|Nov record high C = 40.3\n|Dec record high C = 38.2\n|year record high C = 42.6\n|Jan high C = 25.6\n|Feb high C = 25.7\n|Mar high C = 25.0\n|Apr high C = 23.7\n|May high C = 22.6\n|Jun high C = 21.1\n|Jul high C = 20.9\n|Aug high C = 21.0\n|Sep high C = 21.0\n|Oct high C = 21.5\n|Nov high C = 22.7\n|Dec high C = 24.5\n|year high C = 22.9\n|Jan mean C = 21.6\n|Feb mean C = 21.6\n|Mar mean C = 20.8\n|Apr mean C = 18.9\n|May mean C = 17.1\n|Jun mean C = 15.4\n|Jul mean C = 15.1\n|Aug mean C = 15.4\n|Sep mean C = 16.3\n|Oct mean C = 17.2\n|Nov mean C = 18.7\n|Dec mean C = 20.4\n|year mean C = 18.2\n|Jan low C = 18.4\n|Feb low C = 18.5\n|Mar low C = 17.7\n|Apr low C = 15.2\n|May low C = 12.8\n|Jun low C = 10.7\n|Jul low C = 10.3\n|Aug low C = 10.9\n|Sep low C = 12.4\n|Oct low C = 13.9\n|Nov low C = 15.5\n|Dec low C = 17.0\n|year low C = 14.4\n|Jan record low C = 9.0\n|Feb record low C = 11.0\n|Mar record low C = 10.3\n|Apr record low C = 7.2\n|May record low C = 4.4\n|Jun record low C = 2.6\n|Jul record low C = 1.8\n|Aug record low C = 3.1\n|Sep record low C = 5.0\n|Oct record low C = 5.9\n|Nov record low C = 8.5\n|Dec record low C = 8.4\n|year record low C = 1.8\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 69\n|Feb precipitation mm = 92\n|Mar precipitation mm = 105\n|Apr precipitation mm = 83\n|May precipitation mm = 52\n|Jun precipitation mm = 40\n|Jul precipitation mm = 47\n|Aug precipitation mm = 78\n|Sep precipitation mm = 80\n|Oct precipitation mm = 102\n|Nov precipitation mm = 110\n|Dec precipitation mm = 63\n|year precipitation mm = 921\n|unit precipitation days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 9\n|Feb precipitation days = 9\n|Mar precipitation days = 9\n|Apr precipitation days = 7\n|May precipitation days = 5\n|Jun precipitation days = 4\n|Jul precipitation days = 3\n|Aug precipitation days = 5\n|Sep precipitation days = 7\n|Oct precipitation days = 9\n|Nov precipitation days = 9\n|Dec precipitation days = 8\n|year precipitation days = 84\n|Jan humidity = 80\n|Feb humidity = 82\n|Mar humidity = 82\n|Apr humidity = 78\n|May humidity = 72\n|Jun humidity = 66\n|Jul humidity = 67\n|Aug humidity = 71\n|Sep humidity = 77\n|Oct humidity = 78\n|Nov humidity = 80\n|Dec humidity = 80\n|year humidity = 76\n|Jan sun = 220.5\n|Feb sun = 191.7\n|Mar sun = 204.0\n|Apr sun = 219.3\n|May sun = 227.3\n|Jun sun = 221.1\n|Jul sun = 236.6\n|Aug sun = 234.0\n|Sep sun = 205.7\n|Oct sun = 208.5\n|Nov sun = 215.6\n|Dec sun = 239.7\n|year sun = 2624.0\n|source 1 = NOAA,<ref name=\"NOAA\">{{cite web\n| url = ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/TABLES/REG__I/UA/68858.TXT\n| title = East London Climate Normals 1961\u20131990\n| publisher = National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n| accessdate = 29 November 2013}}</ref> [[Deutscher Wetterdienst]] (extremes)<ref name = DWD>\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.dwd.de/DWD/klima/beratung/ak/ak_688580_kt.pdf\n| title = Klimatafel von East London (Oos-Londen), Prov.

Older sections of the N2 have been renumbered the R102. The R72 is an alternative route to Port Elizabeth, via [[Port Alfred]]. The [[R346 road (South Africa)|R346]] is an alternative route to King William's Town.

Some of them are perennial in nature, others come up on an annual basis while others are biennial in nature. The perennial ones are often very difficult to control. They keep regenerating despite every effort to control them. The annual and biennial ones are easier to deal with. Looking at their visual nature, broadleaf weeds have wide leaves in common. They also have a main center vein that connects to smaller veins which shoot out from a branch. Despite this, they also differ in various  aspects.<ref name=\"MISS\"/>\n\nMost broadleaf weeds develop clusters of blossoms or single flowers as they mature. Such flowers are not aesthetic in nature. They often come in diverse colors such as white, blue, purple, red and so on. Some of them come with  mixed colored flowers while others bear single colored flowers. Despite this, they still appear  unruffled when clustered around a yard or lawn.\n\nThe roots of most broadleaf weeds are fibrous in nature. Some of them spring up with thin roots. Others spring up with a massive taproot while some of them spring up with both types of root systems.  A good number of broadleaf weeds spread through their seeds and rhizomes. Some of them only spread through seeds while others spread through seeds and rhizomes.<ref name=\"UPS\"/>\n\n==Common broadleaf weeds==\nThere are several types of broadleaf weeds  growing in lawns, gardens and yards across the globe.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first =| title =Broadleaf Weeds| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =plantscience.psu.edu| date = | url =https://plantscience.psu.edu/research/centers/turf/extension/plant-id/broadleaf | accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref> Outlined below are the most common broadleaf weeds with their [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial names]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It is also important to seek the advice of a  weed plant expert  when looking for a weed killer.<ref name=\"NEWS\"/>\n\n===Hand-picking===\nIn lawns, gardens or yards where there are few broadleaf weeds present, the best approach to use is hand-pulling.

The use of such chemicals is often the best option when thinking of clearing the entire yard or lawn of all manner of weeds.  In most cases, the chemical content prevent the weeds from re-surfacing for several months.   The perennial types of broadleaf weeds are often controlled with chemical herbicides although they still find their way back after some months  especially when the cleared lawn or yard is  left unused for months.<ref>{{cite news |title=Broadleaf Weed Problems in Lawns |website=LawnTalk |publisher=University of Illinois Extension |url=https://extension.illinois.edu/lawntalk/weeds/broadleaf_weed_problems_in_lawns.cfm |access-date=30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Shading out===\nBroadleaf weeds can be controlled by shading them out.  This involves covering the entire affected area with flat materials such as boards, nylon, plastic spread,  and the like.  When broadleaf weeds are covered that way, they lack access to sunlight and rain that speed up their growth. By so doing, they wither away.<ref name=\"TUR\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Weed]]\n* [[List of common weeds of Queensland]]\n* [[Weed control]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n\n\n[[Category:Garden pests]]\n[[Category:Plants and humans]]\n[[Category:Agricultural pests]]\n", "text_old": "{{Copyedit|date=April 2020}}\n'''Broadleaf weeds''' are unwanted pugnacious and tough plants that grow mostly around free areas in a lawn, garden or yard.<ref name=\"MISS\">{{cite news | last = | first =| title =Perennial Broadleaf Weeds in Lawns| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =missouribotanicalgarden.org| date = | url =http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/help-for-the-home-gardener/advice-tips-resources/pests-and-problems/weeds/broadleaf-weeds.aspx | accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref> They are often very easy to spot because they are different from normal grasses.<ref name=\"UPS\">{{cite news | last = | first =| title =Identify the weeds in your lawn and get rid of them| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =upscalelivingmag.com| date = | url =https://www.upscalelivingmag.com/identify-weeds-lawn-get-rid-good/ | accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref> They  multiply with ease and can be very hard to control.<ref name=\"TUR\">{{cite news | last = | first =| title =5 Tips To Enhance Broadleaf Weed Control| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =turfmagazine.com| date = | url =https://www.turfmagazine.com/lawn-care/5-tips-to-enhance-broadleaf-weed-control/ | accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Basic characteristics==\nBroadleaf weeds generally do not spring up in one specific pattern. Some of them are perennial in nature, others come up on an annual basis while others are biennial in nature. The perennial ones are often very difficult to control. They keep regenerating despite every effort to control them. The annual and biennial ones are easier to deal with. Looking at their visual nature, broadleaf weeds have wide leaves in common. They also have a main center vein that connects to smaller veins which shoot out from a branch. Despite this, they also differ in various  aspects.<ref name=\"MISS\"/>\n\nMost broadleaf weeds develop clusters of blossoms or single flowers as they mature. Such flowers are not aesthetic in nature. They often come in diverse colors such as white, blue, purple, red and so on. Some of them come with  mixed colored flowers while others bear single colored flowers. Despite this, they still appear  unruffled when clustered around a yard or lawn.\n\nThe roots of most broadleaf weeds are fibrous in nature. Some of them spring up with thin roots. Others spring up with a massive taproot while some of them spring up with both types of root systems.  A good number of broadleaf weeds spread through their seeds and rhizomes. Some of them only spread through seeds while others spread through seeds and rhizomes.<ref name=\"UPS\"/>\n\n==Common broadleaf weeds==\nThere are several types of broadleaf weeds  growing in lawns, gardens and yards across the globe.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first =| title =Broadleaf Weeds| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =plantscience.psu.edu| date = | url =https://plantscience.psu.edu/research/centers/turf/extension/plant-id/broadleaf | accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref> Outlined below are the most common broadleaf weeds with their [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial names]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This is not the case with grasses that can easily spring up at any given time.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first =| title =Broadleaf Weeds| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =hgic.clemson.edu| date = | url =https://hgic.clemson.edu/factsheet/broadleaf-weeds/| accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, grassy weeds  are so called because they spring up as desirable grasses.{{Clarify|date=April 2020}}  This makes them very hard to be identified when comparing them with broadleaf weeds.  Grassy weed  come up with blades which showcase as a single leaf from a germinated grass seed.

The gardens, yards and lawns are the most common place they thrive.  There are several ways of controlling them.<ref name=\"NEWS\">{{cite news | last =Trapp | first =Abby | title =Plan a strategy for weed control |work=News-Press NOW |date=28 May 2019 | url =http://www.newspressnow.com/news/local_news/plan-a-strategy-for-weed-control/article_d6d4f086-7db5-11e9-8117-833bed713e1d.html| accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Detecting their growth cycle===\n{{Clarify section|date=April 2020}}\nOne of the best ways of dealing with broadleaf weeds is to detect their growth cycle.  This requires proper monitoring.  Most  plants experts use this method since it has been proven to be the most effective.  It involves discovering how  broadleaf weeds grow and depriving them on that growth cycle.<ref name=\"SC\">{{cite web |title=Learn more about Broadleaf Weeds |website=sciencedirect.com |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/broadleaf-weeds |access-date=30 May 2019}}{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Using a weed killer===\nIn situations where there are massive growth of broadleaf weeds, using a good weed killer can be very helpful.  This is usually the case for lawns or  yards that are overgrown with such weeds. There are several good weed killers available in the market.  It is also important to seek the advice of a  weed plant expert  when looking for a weed killer.<ref name=\"NEWS\"/>\n\n===Hand-picking===\nIn lawns, gardens or yards where there are few broadleaf weeds present, the best approach to use is hand-pulling.  This should be carried out from time to time in order to check the spread weeds.<ref name=\"SC\"/>\n\n===Lawn mowing===\nIn a thick lawn that is overgrown with broadleaf weeds, the lawn moving method is considered the best approach.  This involves the use of a lawn mower in uprooting the weed.  It can be very tedious especially in situations where there are massive growth of the broadleaf weeds.<ref name=\"TUR\"/>\n\n===Use of chemical herbicides===\nThere are chemical herbicides meant for controlling broadleaf weeds.  The use of such chemicals is often the best option when thinking of clearing the entire yard or lawn of all manner of weeds.  In most cases, the chemical content prevent the weeds from re-surfacing for several months.   The perennial types of broadleaf weeds are often controlled with chemical herbicides although they still find their way back after some months  especially when the cleared lawn or yard is  left unused for months.<ref>{{cite news |title=Broadleaf Weed Problems in Lawns |website=LawnTalk |publisher=University of Illinois Extension |url=https://extension.illinois.edu/lawntalk/weeds/broadleaf_weed_problems_in_lawns.cfm |access-date=30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Shading out===\nBroadleaf weeds can be controlled by shading them out.  This involves covering the entire affected area with flat materials such as boards, nylon, plastic spread,  and the like.  When broadleaf weeds are covered that way, they lack access to sunlight and rain that speed up their growth. By so doing, they wither away.<ref name=\"TUR\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Weed]]\n* [[List of common weeds of Queensland]]\n* [[Weed control]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n\n\n[[Category:Garden pests]]\n[[Category:Plants and humans]]\n[[Category:Agricultural pests]]\n", "name_user": "Llunnaz", "label": "safe", "comment": "added article", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadleaf_weeds"}
