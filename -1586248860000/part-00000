The narrations generally state that in March 632, Muhammad, while returning from his [[Farewell Pilgrimage]] alongside a large number of followers and companions, stopped at the oasis of Ghadir Khumm. There, he took Ali's hand and addressed the gathering. The point of contention between different sects is when Muhammad, whilst giving his speech, gave the proclamation \"Anyone who has me as his ''[[mawla]]'', has Ali as his ''mawla.''\" Some versions add the additional sentence \"O God, befriend the friend of Ali and be the enemy of his enemy.\"<ref name=Amir-Moezzi>{{cite journal |title=\"Ghad\u012br Khumm\" in: Encyclopaedia of Islam THREE|last1=Amir-Moezzi |first1=Mohammad Ali |editor1=Kate Fleet|editor2=Gundrun Kr\u00e4mer|editor-link2=Gudrun Kr\u00e4mer|editor3=Denis Matringe|editor4=John Nawas|editor5=Everett Rowson|authorlink1=Mohammad Ali Amir-Moezzi |date=2014 |ref=harv|doi = 10.1163/1573-3912_ei3_COM_27419}}</ref>\n\n''Mawla'' has a number of meanings in [[Arabic]], with interpretations of Muhammad's use here being split along sectarian lines between the Sunni and Shia. Among the former group, the word is translated as \"friend\" or \"one who is loyal/close\" and that Muhammad was advocating that Ali was deserving of friendship and respect.

While they were preparing his body, [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar]], and [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al Jarrah]] met with the leaders of Medina and elected Abu Bakr as caliph. Ali did not accept the caliphate of [[Abu Bakr]] and refused to pledge allegiance to him. This is indicated in both [[Sunni]] and [[Shia]] ''sahih'' and authentic Hadith.\n\n[[File:Al-Kadhimiya Mosque, Kadhmain Shrine.jpg|300px|thumb|Left|[[Al-Kadhimiya Mosque]]]]\n[[Ibn Qutaybah]], a 9th-century [[Sunni]] Islamic scholar narrates of [[Ali]]:<blockquote>I am the servant of God and the brother of the Messenger of God. I am thus more worthy of this office than you. I shall not give allegiance to you [Abu Bakr & Umar] when it is more proper for you to give bay\u02bcah to me. You have seized this office from the Ansar using your tribal relationship to the Prophet as an argument against them. Would you then seize this office from us, the ahl al-bayt by force? Did you not claim before the Ansar that you were more worthy than they of the caliphate because Muhammad came from among you (but Muhammad was never from AbuBakr family) \u2013 and thus they gave you leadership and surrendered command? I now contend against you with the same argument\u2026It is we who are more worthy of the Messenger of God, living or dead. Give us our due right if you truly have faith in God, or else bear the charge of wilfully doing wrong... Umar, I will not yield to your commands: I shall not pledge loyalty to him.' Ultimately Abu Bakr said, \"O 'Ali! If you do not desire to give your bay'ah, I am not going to force you for the same.</blockquote>[[Ali]]'s wife, and daughter of [[Muhammad]], [[Fatimah]], refused to pledge allegiance to [[Abu Bakr]] and remained angry with him until she died due to the issues of [[Fadak]] and her inheritance from her father and the situation of [[Umar at Fatimah's house]]. This is stated in sahih Sunni Hadith, [[Sahih Bukhari]] and Sahih Muslim.

In 680 CE, Muawiyah died and passed the caliphate to his son [[Yazid I|Yazid]], and breaking the treaty with Hasan ibn Ali. Yazid asked Husayn to swear allegiance (''[[bay'ah]]'') to him. Ali's faction, having expected the caliphate to return to Ali's line upon Muawiyah's death, saw this as a betrayal of the peace treaty and so Husayn rejected this request for allegiance. There was a groundswell of support in Kufa for Husayn to return there and take his position as caliph and imam, so Husayn collected his family and followers in Medina and set off for Kufa. En route to Kufa, he was blocked by an army of Yazid's men (which included people from Kufa) near Karbala (modern Iraq), and Husayn and approximately 72 of his family and followers were killed in the [[Battle of Karbala]].\n\nThe Shia regard Husayn as a martyr (''[[shahid]]''), and count him as an Imam from the Ahl al-Bayt. They view Husayn as the defender of Islam from annihilation at the hands of [[Yazid I]].

For instance, the collection of hadith venerated by Shia Muslims is centered on narrations by members of the Ahl al-Bayt and their supporters, while some hadith by narrators not belonging to or supporting the Ahl al-Bayt are not included. Those of [[Abu Hurairah]], for example, Ibn Asakir in his Ta'rikh Kabir and Muttaqi in his Kanzu'l-Umma report that Caliph Umar lashed him, rebuked him and forbade him to narrate hadith from Muhammad. Umar said: \"Because you narrate hadith in large numbers from the Holy Prophet, you are fit only for attributing lies to him. (That is, one expects a wicked man like you to utter only lies about the Holy Prophet.) So you must stop narrating hadith from the Prophet; otherwise, I will send you to the land of Dus.\" (A clan in Yemen, to which Abu Huraira belonged.) According to Sunnis, Ali was the fourth successor to Abu Bakr, while the Shia maintain that Ali was the first divinely sanctioned \"Imam\", or successor of Muhammad. The seminal event in Shia history is the martyrdom in 680 CE at the [[Battle of Karbala]] of Ali's son [[Hussein ibn Ali]], who led a non-allegiance movement against the defiant caliph (71 of Hussein's followers were killed as well).\nIt is believed in Twelver and Ismaili Shia Islam that [['aql]], divine wisdom, was the source of the souls of the prophets and imams and gave them esoteric knowledge called ''\u1e25ikmah'' and that their sufferings were a means of divine grace to their devotees.<ref>Corbin 1993, pp. 45\u201351</ref><ref>Nasr (1979), p. 15</ref> Although the imam was not the recipient of a [[wahy|divine revelation]], he had a close relationship with God, through which God guides him, and the imam, in turn, guides the people.

They argue that since God has commanded absolute obedience from these figures they must only order that which is right. The state of infallibility is based on the Shia interpretation of [[the verse of purification]].<ref>{{Cite quran|33|33|s=ns}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Momen|1985|p=155}}</ref> Thus, they are the most pure ones, the only immaculate ones preserved from, and immune to, all uncleanness.<ref>Corbin (1993), pp. 48 and 49</ref> It does not mean that supernatural powers prevent them from committing a sin, but due to the fact that they have absolute belief in God, they refrain from doing anything that is a sin.<ref name=\"Dabashi\">Dabashi (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=sTFdNNQP4ewC&pg=PA463 p. 463]</ref>\n\nThey also have a complete knowledge of God's will.

The term ''Twelver'' is derived from the doctrine of believing in twelve divinely ordained leaders, known as [[The Twelve Imams]]. Twelver Shia are also known as ''Imami'' or ''Ja'fari'', originated from the name of the 6th Imam, Ja'far al-Sadiq, who elaborated the twelver jurisprudence.<ref>{{harvnb|Cornell|2007|p=237}}</ref>\n\nTwelvers constitute the majority of the population in [[Iran]] (90%),<ref>\"Esposito, John. \"What Everyone Needs to Know about Islam\" Oxford University Press, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-19-515713-0}}. p. 45.</ref> Azerbaijan (85%),<ref name=\"Britannica738\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://files.preslib.az/projects/remz/pdf_en/atr_din.pdf|title=Administrative Department of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan \u2013 Presidential Library \u2013 Religion|publisher=|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123084541/http://files.preslib.az/projects/remz/pdf_en/atr_din.pdf|archivedate=23 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Bahrain (70%), Iraq (65%), Lebanon (65% of Muslims).<ref name=\"esp45\">Esposito, John. \"What Everyone Needs to Know about Islam\" Oxford University Press, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-19-515713-0}}. p. 45</ref><ref name=\"glob\">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/gulf/bahrain-religion.htm|title=Bahrain \u2013 Religion|author=John Pike|work=globalsecurity.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118214401/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/gulf/bahrain-religion.htm|archivedate=18 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=review>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasiareview.com/25032011-challenges-for-saudi-arabia-amidst-protests-in-the-gulf-analysis/|title=Challenges For Saudi Arabia Amidst Protests In The Gulf \u2013 Analysis|work=Eurasia Review|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401034318/http://www.eurasiareview.com/25032011-challenges-for-saudi-arabia-amidst-protests-in-the-gulf-analysis/|archivedate=1 April 2012|df=dmy-all|date=25 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Doctrine====\n[[File:Names of imameen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Names of all 12 Imams (descendants of Imam Ali) written in the form of [[Language|Arabic]] name '''\u0639\u0644\u0649 ''' 'Ali']]\nTwelver doctrine is based on [[Theology of Twelvers|five principles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/shiite-doctrine|title=Shi\u02bfite Doctrine|work=iranicaonline.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517022711/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/shiite-doctrine|archivedate=17 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> These five principles known as ''Usul ad-Din'' are as follow:<ref>Joanne Richter, (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=X9fxXEdeIP8C&pg=PA7 ''Iran the Culture''], p. 7</ref><ref>Mulla Bashir Rahim, ''[http://www.al-islam.org/begin/intro/rahim.html An Introduction to Islam] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091014001501/http://www.al-islam.org/begin/intro/rahim.html |date=14 October 2009 }}'', by [[Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project]]</ref>\n# '''[[Tawhid|Monotheism]]''', God is one and unique.\n# '''[[Adl|Justice]]''', the concept of moral rightness based on ethics, fairness, and equity, along with the punishment of the breach of these ethics.\n# '''[[Nubuwwah|Prophethood]]''', the institution by which God sends emissaries, or prophets, to guide mankind.\n# '''[[Imamate|Leadership]]''', a divine institution which succeeded the institution of Prophethood. Its appointees (imams) are divinely appointed.\n# '''Last Judgment''', God's final assessment of humanity.\n\nMore specifically, these principles are known as Usul al-Madhhab (principles of the Shia sect) according to Twelver Shias which differ from Daruriyat al-Din (Necessities of Religion) which are principles in order for one to be a Muslim. The Necessities of Religion do not include Leadership (Imamah) as it is not a requirement in order for one to be recognized as a Muslim. However, this category, according to Twelver scholars like Ayatollah al-Khoei, does include belief in God, Prophethood, the Day of Resurrection and other \"necessities\" (like belief in angels). In this regard, Twelver Shias draw a distinction in terms of believing in the main principles of Islam on the one hand, and specifically Shia doctrines like Imamah on the other.\n\n====Books====\nBesides the Quran which is common to all Muslims, the Shia derive guidance from books of traditions (\"\u1e25ad\u012bth\") attributed to Muhammad and the Twelve Imams. Below is a list of some of the most prominent of these books:\n* [[Nahj al-Balagha]] by [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] \u2013 the most famous collection of sermons, letters & narration by the first Imam regarded by Shias\n* [[al-Kafi]] by [[Muhammad ibn Ya'qub al-Kulayni]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Islamic Texts Institute|title=Al-Kafi Book I: Intellect and Foolishness|year=2012|publisher=Taqwa Media|isbn=978-1-939420-00-8}}</ref>\n* Wasa'il al-Shi\u02bbah by al-Hurr al-Amili\n\n====The Twelve Imams====\n{{see also|The Twelve Imams|Hadith of the Twelve Successors|l2=Sunni reports about there being 12 successors to the Prophet}}\nThe ''Twelve Imams'' are the spiritual and political successors to Muhammad for the Twelvers.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} According to the theology of Twelvers, the successor of Muhammad is an [[Ismah|infallible]] human individual who not only rules over the community with justice but also is able to keep and interpret the divine law and its esoteric meaning. The words and deeds of Muhammad and the imams are a guide and model for the community to follow; as a result, they must be free from error and sin, and Imams must be chosen by divine decree, or ''nass'', through Muhammad.<ref name=\"Nasr_a\" /><ref name=\"Momen 1985, p. 174\"/> Each imam was the son of the previous imam, with the exception of [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hussein ibn Ali]], who was the brother of Hasan ibn Ali.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} The twelfth and final imam is Muhammad al-Mahdi, who is believed by the Twelvers to be currently alive and in occultation.<ref name=\"Imamat\"/>\n\n====Jurisprudence====\n{{main|Ja'fari jurisprudence}}\n{{see also|Shia clergy}}\nThe Twelver jurisprudence is called ''Ja'fari jurisprudence''. In this [[jurisprudence]] ''Sunnah'' is considered to be the oral traditions of Muhammad and their implementation and interpretation by the twelve Imams. There are three schools of Ja'fari jurisprudence: Usuli, Akhbari, and [[Shaykhism|Shaykhi]]. The Usuli school is by far the largest of the three. Twelver groups that do not follow Ja'fari jurisprudence include [[Alevi]], [[Bektashi Order|Bektashi]], and [[Qizilbash]].\n\nThe five primary pillars of Islam to the Ja'fari jurisprudence, known as ''Usul' ad-Din''. They are at variance with the standard Sunni \"five pillars of religion.\"  The Shia's primary \"pillars\" are:\n\n# ''[[Tawhid]]'' or oneness of God.\n# ''[[Nabuwa]]'' prophethood of Muhammad.\n# ''[[Mu'ad]]'' resurrection.\n# ''[[Adl]]''  justice (of God)\n# ''[[Imama]]''  the rightful place of the Shia Imams\n\nIn Ja'fari jurisprudence, there are eight secondary pillars, known as ''Furu' ad-Din'', which are as follows:<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=X9fxXEdeIP8C&pg=PA7 ''Iran the Culture''] Joanne Richter (2007), p. 7</ref>\n# ''[[salat|Prayer]]''\n# ''[[Sawm|Fasting]]''\n# ''[[Hajj|Pilgrimage]]'' to [[Mecca]]\n# ''[[Zak\u0101t|Alms giving]]''\n# ''[[Jihad|Struggle]]'' for the righteous cause\n# ''[[Ma'ruf|Directing others towards good]]''\n# ''[[Forbidding what is evil|Directing others away from evil]]''\n# ''[[Khums]])'' (20% tax on savings yearly, {after deduction of commercial expenses.})\n\nAccording to Twelvers, defining and interpretation of Islamic jurisprudence is the responsibility of Muhammad and the twelve Imams. As the 12th Imam is in occultation, it is the duty of clerics to refer to the Islamic literature such as the Quran and hadith and identify legal decisions within the confines of Islamic law to provide means to deal with current issues from an Islamic perspective. In other words, Twelver clerics provide Guardianship of the Islamic Jurisprudence, which was defined by Muhammad and his twelve successors. This process is known as ''Ijtihad'' and the clerics are known as ''[[Marja'|Marja]]''', meaning reference.

Followers of the Zaidi [[fiqh]] are called Zaidis (or occasionally '''Fivers'''). However, there is also a group called ''Zaidi Was\u012bt\u012bs'' who are Twelvers (see below).

Zaidis also do not believe that the Imamate must pass from father to son but believe it can be held by any [[Sayyid]] descended from either Hasan ibn Ali or Hussein ibn Ali (as was the case after the death of Hasan ibn Ali). Historically, Zaidis held that Zayd was the rightful successor of the 4th imam since he led a rebellion against the Umayyads in protest of their tyranny and corruption. Muhammad al-Baqir did not engage in political action, and the followers of Zayd believed that a true imam must fight against corrupt rulers.\n\n====Jurisprudence====\nIn matters of [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]], the Zaydis follow Zayd ibn Ali's teachings which are documented in his book ''Majmu'l Fiqh'' (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{big|\u0645\u062c\u0645\u0648\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0650\u0642\u0647}}).

With the eventual development of Twelverism into the more literalistic ''([[Zahir (Islam)|zahir]])'' oriented Akhbari and later Usuli schools of thought, Shiaism developed in two separate directions: the metaphorical Ismailli group focusing on the [[mysticism|mystical]] path and nature of God and the divine manifestation in the personage of the \"Imam of the Time\" as the \"Face of God\", with the more literalistic Twelver group focusing on divine law (''shar\u012b'ah'') and the deeds and sayings (''sunnah'') of Muhammad and his successors (the ''Ahlu l-Bayt''), who as A'immah were guides and a light to God.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/ahsai1.htm | title = Shaykh Ahmad al-Ahsa'i | accessdate = 25 April 2007 | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070218072512/http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/ahsai1.htm | archivedate = 18 February 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThough there are several sub-groupings within the Ismailis, the term in today's vernacular generally refers to the Shia Imami Ismaili Muslim ([[Nizari]] community), generally known as the Ismailis, who are followers of the [[Aga Khan]] and the largest group among the Ismailiyyah.

During this period, three lineages of imams formed. The first branch, known today as the [[Druze]], began with [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]]. Born in 386 AH (985), he ascended as ruler at the age of eleven. The typical religiously tolerant Fatimid Empire saw much persecution under his reign. When in 411 AH (1021) his mule returned without him, soaked in blood, a religious group that was forming in his lifetime broke off from mainstream Ismailism and did not acknowledge his successor.

Upon his passing away, his sons, [[Nizar (Fatimid Imam)|Nizar]] the older, and [[Al-Musta'li]], the younger, fought for political and spiritual control of the dynasty.

The Imam of the Age defines the jurisprudence, and his guidance may differ with Imams previous to him because of different times and circumstances. For Nizari Ismailis, the Imam is Karim al-Husayni [[Aga Khan IV]]. The Nizari line of Imams has continued to this day as an unending line.\n\nDivine leadership has continued in the Bohra branch through the institution of the \"Unrestricted Missionary\" [[List of Dai of Dawoodi Bohra|Dai]]. According to Bohra tradition, before the last Imam, At-Tayyib Abi l-Qasim, went into seclusion, his father, the 20th Al-Amir bi-Ahkami l-Lah, had instructed [[Al-Hurra Al-Malika]] the [[Malik]]a ([[Queen consort]]) in Yemen to appoint a vicegerent after the seclusion\u2014the ''Unrestricted Missionary'', who as the Imam's vicegerent has full authority to govern the community in all matters both spiritual and temporal while the lineage of Mustaali-Tayyibi Imams remains in seclusion (Dawr-e-Satr). The three branches of the Mustaali, the [[Alavi Bohra]], [[Sulaymani|Sulaimani Bohra]] and [[Dawoodi Bohra]], differ on who the current Unrestricted Missionary is.\n\n==Other doctrines==\n\n===Doctrine about necessity of acquiring knowledge===\nAccording to Allameh [[Muhammad Rida al-Muzaffar|Muzaffar]] God gives humans the faculty of reason and argument. Also, God orders humans to spend time thinking carefully on creation while he refers to all creations as his signs of power and glory. These signs encompass all of the universe. Furthermore, there is a similarity between humans as the little world and the universe as the large world. God does not accept the faith of those who follow him without thinking and only with imitation, but also God blames them for such actions.\nIn other words, humans have to think about the universe with reason and intellect, a faculty bestowed on us by God.  Since there is more insistence on the faculty of intellect among Shia, even evaluating the claims of someone who claims prophecy is on the basis of intellect.<ref>{{cite book|author=Allamah Muhammad Rida Al Muzaffar|title=The faith of Shia Islam|year=1989|page=1|publisher=Ansariyan Qum}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.introducingislam.org/info/muzaffar/chapter1.php|title=The Beliefs of Shia Islam \u2013 Chapter 1|publisher=|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025175646/http://www.introducingislam.org/info/muzaffar/chapter1.php|archivedate=25 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Doctrine concerning Du'a===\n\nPraying or Du\u02bca in Shia has an important place as Muhammad described it as a weapon of the believer. In fact, Du\u02bca considered as something that is a feature of Shia community in a sense. Performing Du\u02bca in Shia has a special ritual. Because of this, there are many books written on the conditions of praying among Shia.

Some sources, such as the ''[[Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal]]'', do not record Muhammad's reaction to this, though Ibn Ishaq continues that he then declared Ali to be his brother, heir and successor.<ref>{{harvtxt|Rubin|1995|p=137}}</ref> In another narration, when Muhammad accepted Ali's offer, he \"threw up his arms around the generous youth, and pressed him to his bosom\" and said, \"Behold my brother, my vizir, my vicegerent&nbsp;... let all listen to his words, and obey him.\"<ref>{{citation|last=Irving|first=Washington|authorlink=Washington Irving|title=Mahomet and His Successors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AlMLAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA71|volume=I|year=1868|publisher=G.

The narrations generally state that in March 632, Muhammad, while returning from his [[Farewell Pilgrimage]] alongside a large number of followers and companions, stopped at the oasis of Ghadir Khumm. There, he took Ali's hand and addressed the gathering. The point of contention between different sects is when Muhammad, whilst giving his speech, gave the proclamation \"Anyone who has me as his ''[[mawla]]'', has Ali as his ''mawla.''\" Some versions add the additional sentence \"O God, befriend the friend of Ali and be the enemy of his enemy.\"<ref name=Amir-Moezzi>{{cite journal |title=\"Ghad\u012br Khumm\" in: Encyclopaedia of Islam THREE|last1=Amir-Moezzi |first1=Mohammad Ali |editor1=Kate Fleet|editor2=Gundrun Kr\u00e4mer|editor-link2=Gudrun Kr\u00e4mer|editor3=Denis Matringe|editor4=John Nawas|editor5=Everett Rowson|authorlink1=Mohammad Ali Amir-Moezzi |date=2014 |ref=harv|doi = 10.1163/1573-3912_ei3_COM_27419}}</ref>\n\n''Mawla'' has a number of meanings in [[Arabic]], with interpretations of Muhammad's use here being split along sectarian lines between the Sunni and Shia. Among the former group, the word is translated as \"friend\" or \"one who is loyal/close\" and that Muhammad was advocating that Ali was deserving of friendship and respect.

While they were preparing his body, [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar]], and [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al Jarrah]] met with the leaders of Medina and elected Abu Bakr as caliph. Ali did not accept the caliphate of [[Abu Bakr]] and refused to pledge allegiance to him. This is indicated in both [[Sunni]] and [[Shia]] ''sahih'' and authentic Hadith.\n\n[[File:Al-Kadhimiya Mosque, Kadhmain Shrine.jpg|300px|thumb|Left|[[Al-Kadhimiya Mosque]]]]\n[[Ibn Qutaybah]], a 9th-century [[Sunni]] Islamic scholar narrates of [[Ali]]:<blockquote>I am the servant of God and the brother of the Messenger of God. I am thus more worthy of this office than you. I shall not give allegiance to you [Abu Bakr & Umar] when it is more proper for you to give bay\u02bcah to me. You have seized this office from the Ansar using your tribal relationship to the Prophet as an argument against them. Would you then seize this office from us, the ahl al-bayt by force? Did you not claim before the Ansar that you were more worthy than they of the caliphate because Muhammad came from among you (but Muhammad was never from AbuBakr family) \u2013 and thus they gave you leadership and surrendered command? I now contend against you with the same argument\u2026It is we who are more worthy of the Messenger of God, living or dead. Give us our due right if you truly have faith in God, or else bear the charge of wilfully doing wrong... Umar, I will not yield to your commands: I shall not pledge loyalty to him.' Ultimately Abu Bakr said, \"O 'Ali! If you do not desire to give your bay'ah, I am not going to force you for the same.</blockquote>[[Ali]]'s wife, and daughter of [[Muhammad]], [[Fatimah]], refused to pledge allegiance to [[Abu Bakr]] and remained angry with him until she died due to the issues of [[Fadak]] and her inheritance from her father and the situation of [[Umar at Fatimah's house]]. This is stated in sahih Sunni Hadith, [[Sahih Bukhari]] and Sahih Muslim. [[Fatimah]] did not at all pledge allegiance or acknowledge or accept the caliphate of [[Abu Bakr]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sunnah.com/search/?q=After+the+death+of+Allah+%27s+Apostle+Fatima+the+daughter+of+Allah%27s+Apostle+asked+Abu+Bakr+As-Siddiq+to+give+her,+her+share+of+inheritance+from+what+Allah%27s+Apostle+had+|title=After the death of Allah 's Apostle Fatima the daughter of Allah's Apostle asked Abu Bakr As-Siddiq to give her, her share of inheritance from what Allah's Apostle had (p. 1) \u2013 Sunnah.com \u2013 Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (\u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648 \u0633\u0644\u0645)|publisher=|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010055547/https://sunnah.com/search/?q=After+the+death+of+Allah+%27s+Apostle+Fatima+the+daughter+of+Allah%27s+Apostle+asked+Abu+Bakr+As-Siddiq+to+give+her%2C+her+share+of+inheritance+from+what+Allah%27s+Apostle+had+|archivedate=10 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Almost all of [[Banu Hashim]], [[Muhammad]]'s clan and many of the ''sahaba'', had supported [[Ali]]'s cause after the demise of the prophet whilst others supported [[Abu Bakr]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.al-islam.org/history-shiism-advent-islam-end-minor-occultation-muharrami/lesson-8-shiah-among-companions-sahabah|title=Lesson 8: The Shi\u02bbah among the Companions {sahabah}|website=Al-Islam.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729024723/https://www.al-islam.org/history-shiism-advent-islam-end-minor-occultation-muharrami/lesson-8-shiah-among-companions-sahabah|archivedate=29 July 2017|df=dmy-all|date=February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.al-islam.org/house-sorrows-life-sayyidah-fatimah-al-zahra-and-her-grief-shaykh-abbas-qummi/chapter-3-state|title=Chapter 3: State of Affairs in Saqifah after the Death of the Prophet|website=Al-Islam.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729151253/https://www.al-islam.org/house-sorrows-life-sayyidah-fatimah-al-zahra-and-her-grief-shaykh-abbas-qummi/chapter-3-state|archivedate=29 July 2017|df=dmy-all|date=21 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicinsights.com/religion/clergy-corner/did-imam-ali-give-allegiance-to-abu-bakr.html|title=Did Imam Ali Give Allegiance to Abu Bakr?|publisher= Islamic Insights|date=8 December 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628084915/http://www.islamicinsights.com/religion/clergy-corner/did-imam-ali-give-allegiance-to-abu-bakr.html|archivedate=28 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>Riz\u0324v\u012b, Sayyid Sa'eed Ak\u0332h\u0332tar.

In 680 CE, Muawiyah died and passed the caliphate to his son [[Yazid I|Yazid]], and breaking the treaty with Hasan ibn Ali. Yazid asked Husayn to swear allegiance (''[[bay'ah]]'') to him. Ali's faction, having expected the caliphate to return to Ali's line upon Muawiyah's death, saw this as a betrayal of the peace treaty and so Husayn rejected this request for allegiance. There was a groundswell of support in Kufa for Husayn to return there and take his position as caliph and imam, so Husayn collected his family and followers in Medina and set off for Kufa. En route to Kufa, he was blocked by an army of Yazid's men (which included people from Kufa) near Karbala (modern Iraq), and Husayn and approximately 72 of his family and followers were killed in the [[Battle of Karbala]].\n\nThe Shia regard Husayn as a martyr (''[[shahid]]''), and count him as an Imam from the Ahl al-Bayt. They view Husayn as the defender of Islam from annihilation at the hands of [[Yazid I]].

For instance, the collection of hadith venerated by Shia Muslims is centered on narrations by members of the Ahl al-Bayt and their supporters, while some hadith by narrators not belonging to or supporting the Ahl al-Bayt are not included. Those of [[Abu Hurairah]], for example, Ibn Asakir in his Ta'rikh Kabir and Muttaqi in his Kanzu'l-Umma report that Caliph Umar lashed him, rebuked him and forbade him to narrate hadith from Muhammad. Umar said: \"Because you narrate hadith in large numbers from the Holy Prophet, you are fit only for attributing lies to him. (That is, one expects a wicked man like you to utter only lies about the Holy Prophet.) So you must stop narrating hadith from the Prophet; otherwise, I will send you to the land of Dus.\" (A clan in Yemen, to which Abu Huraira belonged.) According to Sunnis, Ali was the fourth successor to Abu Bakr, while the Shia maintain that Ali was the first divinely sanctioned \"Imam\", or successor of Muhammad. The seminal event in Shia history is the martyrdom in 680 CE at the [[Battle of Karbala]] of Ali's son [[Hussein ibn Ali]], who led a non-allegiance movement against the defiant caliph (71 of Hussein's followers were killed as well).\nIt is believed in Twelver and Ismaili Shia Islam that [['aql]], divine wisdom, was the source of the souls of the prophets and imams and gave them esoteric knowledge called ''\u1e25ikmah'' and that their sufferings were a means of divine grace to their devotees.<ref>Corbin 1993, pp. 45\u201351</ref><ref>Nasr (1979), p. 15</ref> Although the imam was not the recipient of a [[wahy|divine revelation]], he had a close relationship with God, through which God guides him, and the imam, in turn, guides the people.

This caused a number of changes in the Muslim world:\n* The ending of the relative mutual tolerance between Sunnis and Shias that existed from the time of the [[Mongol conquests]] onwards and the resurgence of antagonism between the two groups.\n* Initial dependence of Shiite clerics on the state followed by the emergence of an independent body of ''[[ulama]]'' capable of taking a political stand different from official policies.<ref>Francis Robinson, ''Atlas of the Muslim World'', p. 49.</ref>\n* The growth in importance of Iranian centers of religious learning and change from Twelver Shiism being a predominantly [[Arab people|Arab]] phenomenon.<ref>{{harvnb|Momen|1985|p=123}}</ref>\n* The growth of the [[Akhbari]] School which preached that only the [[Qur'an and Sunnah|Quran, hadith]] are to be bases for verdicts, rejecting the use of reasoning.\n\nWith the fall of the Safavids, the state in Persia\u2014including the state system of courts with government-appointed judges ([[qadi]]s)\u2014became much weaker. This gave the Sharia courts of ''[[mujtahid]]s'' an opportunity to fill the legal vacuum and enabled the ulama to assert their judicial authority.

The Sunni Shahada states ''There is no god except God, Muhammad is the messenger of God'', but to this the Shia append ''Ali is the [[Wali]] (custodian) of God'', {{lang|ar|\u0639\u0644\u064a \u0648\u0644\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647}}. This phrase embodies the Shia emphasis on the inheritance of authority through Muhammad's lineage. The three clauses of the Shia Shahada thus address ''[[tawhid]]'' (the unity of [[God]]), ''[[nubuwwah]]'' (the prophethood of Muhammad), and ''[[imamah]]'' (imamate, the leadership of the faith).\n\nThe basis of Ali as the \"wali\" is taken from a specific verse of the quran\n.<ref>quran 5:55</ref>  A more detailed discussion of this verse is available.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verse_of_Wilayah | title=Verse of Wilayah}}</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Infallibility==\n[[File:Al\u012b.png|thumb|[[Ali]] is credited as the first male to convert to [[Islam]].]]\n{{main|Ismah}}\n''Ismah'' is the concept of [[infallibility]] or \"divinely bestowed freedom from error and sin\" in Islam.<ref>Dabashi, ''Theology of Discontent'', p. 463</ref> Muslims believe that Muhammad and other prophets in Islam possessed ''ismah''. Twelver and Ismaili Shia Muslims also attribute the quality to [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imams]] as well as to [[Fatimah]], daughter of Muhammad, in contrast to the Zaidi, who do not attribute 'ismah to the Imams.<ref>Francis Robinson, ''Atlas of the Muslim World'', p. 47.</ref> Though initially beginning as a political movement, infallibility and sinlessness of the imams later evolved as a distinct belief of (non-Zaidi) Shiism.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Shii | title=Sh\u012b\u02bfite | work=Britannica | accessdate=21 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Shia theologians, infallibility is considered a rational necessary precondition for spiritual and religious guidance. They argue that since God has commanded absolute obedience from these figures they must only order that which is right. The state of infallibility is based on the Shia interpretation of [[the verse of purification]].<ref>{{Cite quran|33|33|s=ns}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Momen|1985|p=155}}</ref> Thus, they are the most pure ones, the only immaculate ones preserved from, and immune to, all uncleanness.<ref>Corbin (1993), pp. 48 and 49</ref> It does not mean that supernatural powers prevent them from committing a sin, but due to the fact that they have absolute belief in God, they refrain from doing anything that is a sin.<ref name=\"Dabashi\">Dabashi (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=sTFdNNQP4ewC&pg=PA463 p. 463]</ref>\n\nThey also have a complete knowledge of God's will.

They thus act without fault in religious matters.<ref>Corbin (1993), p. 48</ref> Shias regard Ali as the successor of Muhammad not only ruling over [[Ummah|the community]] in justice, but also interpreting Islamic practices and its esoteric meaning.

The groups which do believe in it differ as to which lineage of the Imamate is valid, and therefore which individual has gone into occultation. They believe there are many signs that will indicate the time of his return.\n\nTwelver Shia Muslims believe that the Mahdi (the [[Twelve Imams|twelfth imam]], [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]]) is already on Earth, is in occultation and will return at the end of time.

The term ''Twelver'' is derived from the doctrine of believing in twelve divinely ordained leaders, known as [[The Twelve Imams]]. Twelver Shia are also known as ''Imami'' or ''Ja'fari'', originated from the name of the 6th Imam, Ja'far al-Sadiq, who elaborated the twelver jurisprudence.<ref>{{harvnb|Cornell|2007|p=237}}</ref>\n\nTwelvers constitute the majority of the population in [[Iran]] (90%),<ref>\"Esposito, John. \"What Everyone Needs to Know about Islam\" Oxford University Press, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-19-515713-0}}. p. 45.</ref> Azerbaijan (85%),<ref name=\"Britannica738\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://files.preslib.az/projects/remz/pdf_en/atr_din.pdf|title=Administrative Department of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan \u2013 Presidential Library \u2013 Religion|publisher=|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123084541/http://files.preslib.az/projects/remz/pdf_en/atr_din.pdf|archivedate=23 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Bahrain (70%), Iraq (65%), Lebanon (65% of Muslims).<ref name=\"esp45\">Esposito, John. \"What Everyone Needs to Know about Islam\" Oxford University Press, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-19-515713-0}}. p. 45</ref><ref name=\"glob\">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/gulf/bahrain-religion.htm|title=Bahrain \u2013 Religion|author=John Pike|work=globalsecurity.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118214401/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/gulf/bahrain-religion.htm|archivedate=18 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=review>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasiareview.com/25032011-challenges-for-saudi-arabia-amidst-protests-in-the-gulf-analysis/|title=Challenges For Saudi Arabia Amidst Protests In The Gulf \u2013 Analysis|work=Eurasia Review|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401034318/http://www.eurasiareview.com/25032011-challenges-for-saudi-arabia-amidst-protests-in-the-gulf-analysis/|archivedate=1 April 2012|df=dmy-all|date=25 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Doctrine====\n[[File:Names of imameen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Names of all 12 Imams (descendants of Imam Ali) written in the form of [[Language|Arabic]] name '''\u0639\u0644\u0649 ''' 'Ali']]\nTwelver doctrine is based on [[Theology of Twelvers|five principles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/shiite-doctrine|title=Shi\u02bfite Doctrine|work=iranicaonline.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517022711/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/shiite-doctrine|archivedate=17 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> These five principles known as ''Usul ad-Din'' are as follow:<ref>Joanne Richter, (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=X9fxXEdeIP8C&pg=PA7 ''Iran the Culture''], p. 7</ref><ref>Mulla Bashir Rahim, ''[http://www.al-islam.org/begin/intro/rahim.html An Introduction to Islam] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091014001501/http://www.al-islam.org/begin/intro/rahim.html |date=14 October 2009 }}'', by [[Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project]]</ref>\n# '''[[Tawhid|Monotheism]]''', God is one and unique.\n# '''[[Adl|Justice]]''', the concept of moral rightness based on ethics, fairness, and equity, along with the punishment of the breach of these ethics.\n# '''[[Nubuwwah|Prophethood]]''', the institution by which God sends emissaries, or prophets, to guide mankind.\n# '''[[Imamate|Leadership]]''', a divine institution which succeeded the institution of Prophethood. Its appointees (imams) are divinely appointed.\n# '''Last Judgment''', God's final assessment of humanity.\n\nMore specifically, these principles are known as Usul al-Madhhab (principles of the Shia sect) according to Twelver Shias which differ from Daruriyat al-Din (Necessities of Religion) which are principles in order for one to be a Muslim. The Necessities of Religion do not include Leadership (Imamah) as it is not a requirement in order for one to be recognized as a Muslim. However, this category, according to Twelver scholars like Ayatollah al-Khoei, does include belief in God, Prophethood, the Day of Resurrection and other \"necessities\" (like belief in angels). In this regard, Twelver Shias draw a distinction in terms of believing in the main principles of Islam on the one hand, and specifically Shia doctrines like Imamah on the other.\n\n====Books====\nBesides the Quran which is common to all Muslims, the Shia derive guidance from books of traditions (\"\u1e25ad\u012bth\") attributed to Muhammad and the Twelve Imams. Below is a list of some of the most prominent of these books:\n* [[Nahj al-Balagha]] by [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] \u2013 the most famous collection of sermons, letters & narration by the first Imam regarded by Shias\n* [[al-Kafi]] by [[Muhammad ibn Ya'qub al-Kulayni]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Islamic Texts Institute|title=Al-Kafi Book I: Intellect and Foolishness|year=2012|publisher=Taqwa Media|isbn=978-1-939420-00-8}}</ref>\n* Wasa'il al-Shi\u02bbah by al-Hurr al-Amili\n\n====The Twelve Imams====\n{{see also|The Twelve Imams|Hadith of the Twelve Successors|l2=Sunni reports about there being 12 successors to the Prophet}}\nThe ''Twelve Imams'' are the spiritual and political successors to Muhammad for the Twelvers.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} According to the theology of Twelvers, the successor of Muhammad is an [[Ismah|infallible]] human individual who not only rules over the community with justice but also is able to keep and interpret the divine law and its esoteric meaning. The words and deeds of Muhammad and the imams are a guide and model for the community to follow; as a result, they must be free from error and sin, and Imams must be chosen by divine decree, or ''nass'', through Muhammad.<ref name=\"Nasr_a\" /><ref name=\"Momen 1985, p. 174\"/> Each imam was the son of the previous imam, with the exception of [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hussein ibn Ali]], who was the brother of Hasan ibn Ali.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} The twelfth and final imam is Muhammad al-Mahdi, who is believed by the Twelvers to be currently alive and in occultation.<ref name=\"Imamat\"/>\n\n====Jurisprudence====\n{{main|Ja'fari jurisprudence}}\n{{see also|Shia clergy}}\nThe Twelver jurisprudence is called ''Ja'fari jurisprudence''. In this [[jurisprudence]] ''Sunnah'' is considered to be the oral traditions of Muhammad and their implementation and interpretation by the twelve Imams. There are three schools of Ja'fari jurisprudence: Usuli, Akhbari, and [[Shaykhism|Shaykhi]]. The Usuli school is by far the largest of the three. Twelver groups that do not follow Ja'fari jurisprudence include [[Alevi]], [[Bektashi Order|Bektashi]], and [[Qizilbash]].\n\nThe five primary pillars of Islam to the Ja'fari jurisprudence, known as ''Usul' ad-Din''. They are at variance with the standard Sunni \"five pillars of religion.\"  The Shia's primary \"pillars\" are:\n\n# ''[[Tawhid]]'' or oneness of God.\n# ''[[Nabuwa]]'' prophethood of Muhammad.\n# ''[[Mu'ad]]'' resurrection.\n# ''[[Adl]]''  justice (of God)\n# ''[[Imama]]''  the rightful place of the Shia Imams\n\nIn Ja'fari jurisprudence, there are eight secondary pillars, known as ''Furu' ad-Din'', which are as follows:<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=X9fxXEdeIP8C&pg=PA7 ''Iran the Culture''] Joanne Richter (2007), p. 7</ref>\n# ''[[salat|Prayer]]''\n# ''[[Sawm|Fasting]]''\n# ''[[Hajj|Pilgrimage]]'' to [[Mecca]]\n# ''[[Zak\u0101t|Alms giving]]''\n# ''[[Jihad|Struggle]]'' for the righteous cause\n# ''[[Ma'ruf|Directing others towards good]]''\n# ''[[Forbidding what is evil|Directing others away from evil]]''\n# ''[[Khums]])'' (20% tax on savings yearly, {after deduction of commercial expenses.})\n\nAccording to Twelvers, defining and interpretation of Islamic jurisprudence is the responsibility of Muhammad and the twelve Imams. As the 12th Imam is in occultation, it is the duty of clerics to refer to the Islamic literature such as the Quran and hadith and identify legal decisions within the confines of Islamic law to provide means to deal with current issues from an Islamic perspective. In other words, Twelver clerics provide Guardianship of the Islamic Jurisprudence, which was defined by Muhammad and his twelve successors. This process is known as ''Ijtihad'' and the clerics are known as ''[[Marja'|Marja]]''', meaning reference.

Followers of the Zaidi [[fiqh]] are called Zaidis (or occasionally '''Fivers'''). However, there is also a group called ''Zaidi Was\u012bt\u012bs'' who are Twelvers (see below).

Zaidis also do not believe that the Imamate must pass from father to son but believe it can be held by any [[Sayyid]] descended from either Hasan ibn Ali or Hussein ibn Ali (as was the case after the death of Hasan ibn Ali). Historically, Zaidis held that Zayd was the rightful successor of the 4th imam since he led a rebellion against the Umayyads in protest of their tyranny and corruption. Muhammad al-Baqir did not engage in political action, and the followers of Zayd believed that a true imam must fight against corrupt rulers.\n\n====Jurisprudence====\nIn matters of [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]], the Zaydis follow Zayd ibn Ali's teachings which are documented in his book ''Majmu'l Fiqh'' (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{big|\u0645\u062c\u0645\u0648\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0650\u0642\u0647}}).

With the eventual development of Twelverism into the more literalistic ''([[Zahir (Islam)|zahir]])'' oriented Akhbari and later Usuli schools of thought, Shiaism developed in two separate directions: the metaphorical Ismailli group focusing on the [[mysticism|mystical]] path and nature of God and the divine manifestation in the personage of the \"Imam of the Time\" as the \"Face of God\", with the more literalistic Twelver group focusing on divine law (''shar\u012b'ah'') and the deeds and sayings (''sunnah'') of Muhammad and his successors (the ''Ahlu l-Bayt''), who as A'immah were guides and a light to God.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/ahsai1.htm | title = Shaykh Ahmad al-Ahsa'i | accessdate = 25 April 2007 | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070218072512/http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/ahsai1.htm | archivedate = 18 February 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThough there are several sub-groupings within the Ismailis, the term in today's vernacular generally refers to the Shia Imami Ismaili Muslim ([[Nizari]] community), generally known as the Ismailis, who are followers of the [[Aga Khan]] and the largest group among the Ismailiyyah.

During this period, three lineages of imams formed. The first branch, known today as the [[Druze]], began with [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]]. Born in 386 AH (985), he ascended as ruler at the age of eleven. The typical religiously tolerant Fatimid Empire saw much persecution under his reign. When in 411 AH (1021) his mule returned without him, soaked in blood, a religious group that was forming in his lifetime broke off from mainstream Ismailism and did not acknowledge his successor.

Upon his passing away, his sons, [[Nizar (Fatimid Imam)|Nizar]] the older, and [[Al-Musta'li]], the younger, fought for political and spiritual control of the dynasty.

The Imam of the Age defines the jurisprudence, and his guidance may differ with Imams previous to him because of different times and circumstances. For Nizari Ismailis, the Imam is Karim al-Husayni [[Aga Khan IV]]. The Nizari line of Imams has continued to this day as an unending line.\n\nDivine leadership has continued in the Bohra branch through the institution of the \"Unrestricted Missionary\" [[List of Dai of Dawoodi Bohra|Dai]]. According to Bohra tradition, before the last Imam, At-Tayyib Abi l-Qasim, went into seclusion, his father, the 20th Al-Amir bi-Ahkami l-Lah, had instructed [[Al-Hurra Al-Malika]] the [[Malik]]a ([[Queen consort]]) in Yemen to appoint a vicegerent after the seclusion\u2014the ''Unrestricted Missionary'', who as the Imam's vicegerent has full authority to govern the community in all matters both spiritual and temporal while the lineage of Mustaali-Tayyibi Imams remains in seclusion (Dawr-e-Satr). The three branches of the Mustaali, the [[Alavi Bohra]], [[Sulaymani|Sulaimani Bohra]] and [[Dawoodi Bohra]], differ on who the current Unrestricted Missionary is.\n\n==Other doctrines==\n\n===Doctrine about necessity of acquiring knowledge===\nAccording to Allameh [[Muhammad Rida al-Muzaffar|Muzaffar]] God gives humans the faculty of reason and argument. Also, God orders humans to spend time thinking carefully on creation while he refers to all creations as his signs of power and glory. These signs encompass all of the universe. Furthermore, there is a similarity between humans as the little world and the universe as the large world. God does not accept the faith of those who follow him without thinking and only with imitation, but also God blames them for such actions.\nIn other words, humans have to think about the universe with reason and intellect, a faculty bestowed on us by God.  Since there is more insistence on the faculty of intellect among Shia, even evaluating the claims of someone who claims prophecy is on the basis of intellect.<ref>{{cite book|author=Allamah Muhammad Rida Al Muzaffar|title=The faith of Shia Islam|year=1989|page=1|publisher=Ansariyan Qum}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.introducingislam.org/info/muzaffar/chapter1.php|title=The Beliefs of Shia Islam \u2013 Chapter 1|publisher=|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025175646/http://www.introducingislam.org/info/muzaffar/chapter1.php|archivedate=25 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Doctrine concerning Du'a===\n\nPraying or Du\u02bca in Shia has an important place as Muhammad described it as a weapon of the believer. In fact, Du\u02bca considered as something that is a feature of Shia community in a sense. Performing Du\u02bca in Shia has a special ritual. Because of this, there are many books written on the conditions of praying among Shia.
