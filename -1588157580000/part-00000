There are many names for these overall buildings, see below. The [[housing tenure]] of apartments also varies considerably, from large-scale [[public housing]], to [[owner occupancy]] within what is legally a [[condominium]] ([[strata title]] or [[commonhold]]), to tenants renting from a private landlord (see [[leasehold estate]]).\n\n==Terminology==\n===\"Flat\" vs \"apartment\"===\nBoth words refer to a self-contained residential unit with its own front door, kitchen, toilet, and [[bathroom]]. In some parts of the world, the word ''apartment'' refers to a purpose-built unit in a building, whereas the word ''flat'' means a converted unit in an older building, usually a big house.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} In other places the terms are interchangeable.\n\nThe term ''apartment'' is favored in North America (although in some cities ''flat'' is used for a unit which is part of a house containing two or three units, typically one to a floor<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lexico.com/definition/apartment|title=Apartment {{!}} Meaning of Apartment by Lexico|website=Lexico Dictionaries {{!}} English|language=en|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}). In the UK, the term  ''apartment'' is more usual in professional [[real estate]] and [[architectural]] circles where otherwise the term ''flat'' is used commonly, but not exclusively, for an apartment on a single level (hence a 'flat' apartment).\n\nIn some countries, the word \"[[Unit (housing)|unit]]\" is a more general term referring to both apartments and rental business [[Suite (address)|suite]]s. The word 'unit' is generally used only in the context of a specific building; e.g., \"This building has three units\" or \"I'm going to rent a unit in this building\", but not \"I'm going to rent a unit somewhere\".\n\nSome buildings can be characterized as 'mixed-use buildings', meaning part of the building is for commercial, business, or office use, usually on the first floor or first couple of floors, and one or more apartments are found in the rest of the building, usually on the upper floors.\n\n===By housing tenure===\n[[File:St James Town1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Low-income housing]] of the [[St. James Town]] neighborhood in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada]]\n[[File:Cove, Punggol Field.JPG|thumb|right|[[Housing Development Board]] flats in [[Punggol]], [[Singapore]] ]]\n\n([[Condominium]], [[public housing]], [[owner-occupancy]], etc.)\n\n[[Tenement (law)|Tenement law]] refers to the [[feudalism|feudal]] basis of permanent property such as land or rents. It may be found combined as in \"[[Messuage]] or Tenement\" to encompass all the land, buildings and other assets of a property.\n\nIn the United States, some apartment-dwellers own their units, either as a [[housing cooperative]], in which the residents own shares of a corporation that owns the building or development; or in a [[condominium]], whose residents own their apartments and share ownership of the public spaces. Most apartments are in buildings designed for the purpose, but large older [[house]]s are sometimes divided into apartments. The word ''apartment'' denotes a residential unit or section in a building. In some locations, particularly the United States, the word connotes a rental unit owned by the building owner, and is not typically used for a condominium.\n\nIn England and Wales, some flat owners own shares in the company that owns the [[Fee simple|freehold]] of the building as well as holding the flat under a lease.  This arrangement is commonly known as a \"share of freehold\" flat. The freehold company has the right to collect annual ground rents from each of the flat owners in the building. The freeholder can also develop or sell the building, subject to the usual planning and restrictions that might apply. This situation does not happen in Scotland, where long leasehold of residential property was formerly unusual, and is now impossible.<ref>{{cite web| title=Long Leases (Scotland) Act 2012| website=UK Legislation| date=2012| url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2012/9/contents/enacted | accessdate=9 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===By size of the unit===\nBachelor apartment, one-[[bedroom]], etc.; see below.\n\n===By size of the building===\n[[File:English Bay Vancouver.jpg|thumb|right|[[High-rise building]]s in the [[English Bay (Vancouver)|English Bay]] area of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada]]\n[[File:Fatima 0549 (19531851070).jpg|thumb|left|A [[low-rise building]] of flats above shops in [[F\u00e1tima, Portugal]]]]\n\nApartment buildings are [[multi-story]] buildings where three or more residences are contained within one structure. Such a building may be called an ''apartment building'', ''apartment complex'', ''flat complex'', ''block of flats'', ''tower block'', ''high-rise'' or, occasionally, ''mansion block'' (in British English), especially if it consists of many apartments for rent. A high-rise apartment building is commonly referred to as a ''residential tower'', ''apartment tower'', or ''block of flats'' in Australia.\n\nA [[high-rise building]] is defined by its height differently in various [[jurisdiction]]s. It may be only residential, in which case it might also be called a tower block, or it might include other functions such as hotel, offices, or shops. There is no clear difference between a tower block and a [[skyscraper]], although a building with fifty or more stories is generally considered a skyscraper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/547956/skyscraper|title=skyscraper|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc|accessdate=19 September 2012}}</ref> High-rise buildings became possible with the invention of the [[elevator]] (lift) and cheaper, more abundant building materials. Their [[structural system]] usually is made of [[reinforced concrete]] and [[steel]].\n\nA [[low-rise building]] and mid-rise buildings have fewer storeys, but the limits are not always clear. [[Emporis]] defines a low-rise as \"an enclosed structure below 35 metres [115 feet] which is divided into regular floor levels.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://standards.emporis.com/?nav=realestate&lng=3&esn=49213 |title=Data Standards: Structures - low-rise building |publisher=Emporis Standards |accessdate=10 June 2009}}</ref> The city of [[Toronto]] defines a mid-rise as a building between 4 and 12 stories.<ref>http://faculty.geog.utoronto.ca/Hess/Courses/studio/presentation%20on%20avenues%20and%20mid-rise%20study.pdf</ref>\n\n===By country===\nIn [[American English]], the distinction between rental apartments and [[condominium]]s is that while rental buildings are owned by a single entity and rented out to many, condominiums are owned individually, while their owners still pay a monthly or yearly fee for building upkeep. Condominiums are often leased by their owner as rental apartments. A third alternative, the [[Housing cooperative|cooperative apartment]] building (or \"co-op\"), acts as a corporation with all of the tenants as shareholders of the building. Tenants in cooperative buildings do not own their apartment, but instead own a proportional number of shares of the entire cooperative. As in condominiums, cooperators pay a monthly fee for building upkeep. Co-ops are common in cities such as New York, and have gained some popularity in other larger urban areas in the U.S.\n\nIn [[British English]] the usual word is \"flat\", but ''apartment'' is used by property developers to denote expensive 'flats' in exclusive and expensive residential areas in, for example, parts of London such as [[Belgravia]] and [[Hampstead]]. In Scotland, it is called a block of flats or, if it is a traditional sandstone building, a ''[[tenement]]'', a term which has a negative connotation elsewhere.\n\nIn India, the word flat is used to refer to multi-storey dwellings that have lifts.<ref>[https://www.magicbricks.com/flats-in-new-delhi-for-sale-pppfs]</ref>\n\n[[Australian English]] and [[New Zealand English]] traditionally used the term ''flat'' (although it also applies to any rental property), and more recently also use the terms ''unit'' or ''apartment''. In Australia, a 'unit' refers to flats, apartments or even [[semi-detached]] houses. In Australia, the terms \"unit\", \"flat\" and \"apartment\" are largely used interchangeably. Newer high-rise buildings are more often marketed as \"apartments\", as the term \"flats\" carries colloquial connotations. The term condominium or condo is rarely used in Australia despite attempts by developers to market it.\n\nIn [[South African English]], an apartment is usually a single level rental area that is a part of a larger building and can be entered from inside the building through a separate door leading off either a wind tunnel or entrance hall/lobby that is shared with other occupants of the building.\n\nIn [[Malaysian English]], ''flat'' often denotes a housing block of two rooms with walk-up, no lift, without facilities, typically five storeys tall, and with outdoor parking space,<ref>[https://www.propsocial.my/topic/226/categories-of-homes-in-malaysia-posted-by-propsocial-editor?all=1 Categories of Homes in Malaysia.]</ref> while ''apartment'' is more generic and may also include luxury condominiums.\n\nIn Japanese English [[loanword]]s (''[[Wasei-eigo]]''), the term ''apartment'' (''apaato'') is used for lower-income housing and ''mansion'' (''manshon'') is used for high-end apartments; but both terms refer to what English-speakers regard as an apartment (or condominium) and not the level of luxury of a [[mansion]] in English parlance. See [[Housing in Japan]]. ''[[Danchi]]'' is the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word for a large cluster of apartment buildings of a particular style and design, typically built as [[public housing]] by government authorities.\n\n==Types and characteristics==\n===Studio apartment===\n[[File:Cuisinette studio in Sherbrooke April 2010.jpg|thumb|Studio apartment in [[Sherbrooke, Quebec]], Canada, showing double bed, kitchenette, and entrance way with sliding door to closet]]\n{{Main|Studio apartment}}\n{{See also|Microapartment}}\nThe smallest self-contained apartments are referred to as studio, efficiency or bachelor apartments in the US, or studio flat in the UK. These units usually consist of a large single main room which acts as the living room, dining room and bedroom combined and usually also includes kitchen facilities, with a separate bathroom. In Korea, the term \"one room\" (''wonroom'') refers to a studio apartment.<ref>{{cite web | title='Konglish' Not Spoken Here: Asia Society Korea Center Targets Signs and Schoolbooks | website=Asia Society | date=11 October 2012  | url=http://asiasociety.org/blog/asia/konglish-not-spoken-here-asia-society-korea-center-targets-signs-and-schoolbooks | accessdate=5 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nA [[bedsit]] is a UK variant on single room accommodation: a bed-sitting room, probably without cooking facilities, with a shared bathroom. A bedsit is not self-contained and so is not an apartment or flat as this article uses the terms; it forms part of what the UK government calls a [[House in multiple occupation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Private renting: Houses in multiple occupation - GOV.UK|url=https://www.gov.uk/private-renting/houses-in-multiple-occupation|website=www.gov.uk|accessdate=16 April 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Garden apartment (US)===\n[[Merriam-Webster]] defines a garden apartment in [[American English]] as \"a multiple-unit low-rise dwelling having considerable lawn or garden space\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Garden apartment |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/garden%20apartment |website=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |accessdate=29 August 2018}}</ref> The apartment buildings are often arranged around courtyards that are open at one end. Such a garden apartment shares some characteristics of a [[townhouse]]: each apartment has its own building entrance, or shares that entrance via a staircase and lobby that adjoins other units immediately above and/or below it. Unlike a townhouse, each apartment occupies only one level. Such garden apartment buildings are almost never more than three stories high, since they typically lack [[elevator]]s. However, the first \"garden apartment\" buildings in New York, USA, built in the early 1900s, were constructed five stories high.<ref>[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/garden_apartments/ New York City Garden Apartments] retrieved 17 October 2009</ref><ref>Hogan, Meghan.

The interior grounds are often landscaped.\n\n===Garden flat (UK)===\n[[File:Streets of Bayswater.jpg|thumb|[[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] terraced [[townhouse (Great Britain)|townhouses]]. The black railings enclose the basement areas, which in the twentieth century were converted to garden flats.]]\nThe ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines the use of \"garden flat\" in [[British English]] as \"a basement or ground-floor flat with a view of and access to a garden or lawn\", although its citations acknowledge that the reference to a garden may be illusory. \"Garden flat\" can serve simply as a euphemism for a basement. The large [[townhouse (Great Britain)|Georgian or Victorian townhouse]] was built with an excavated subterranean space around its front known as [[Area (architecture)|an area]], often surrounded by cast iron railings. This lowest floor housed the kitchen, the main place of work for the servants, with a \"tradesman's entrance\" via the area stairs. This \"lower ground floor\" (another euphemism) has proven ideal for conversion to a self-contained \"garden flat\". One American term for this arrangement is an [[English basement]].\n\n===Basement apartment===\n{{Main|Basement apartment}}\nGenerally on the lowest floor of a building.\n\n===Secondary suite===\n{{Main|Secondary suite}}\nWhen part of a house is converted for the ostensible use of the owner's family member, the self-contained dwelling may be known as an \"in-law apartment\", \"annexe\", or \"granny flat\", though these (sometimes illegally) created units are often occupied by ordinary renters rather than the landlord's relative. In Canada these are commonly located below the main house and are therefore \"basement suites\".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Another term is an \"accessory dwelling unit\", which may be part of the main house, or a free-standing structure in its grounds.\n\n===Salon apartment===\n''Salon apartment'' is a term linked to the exclusive apartments built as part of multi-family houses in [[Belgrade]] and in certain towns in [[Yugoslavia]] in the first decades of the 20th century.<ref>Alfirevi\u0107 \u0110or\u0111e, Simonovi\u0107 Alfirevi\u0107 San\u0458a.

This is a very common arrangement in much post-[[World War II|war]] British public housing, serving both to reduce costs by reducing the amount of space given to access corridors and to emulate the 'traditional' two-storey terrace house to which many of the residents would have been accustomed.\n\nA maisonette could encompass [[Tyneside flat]]s, pairs of single-storey flats within a two-storey [[terraced house|terrace]]. Their distinctive feature is their use of two separate front doors onto the street, each door leading to a single flat.<ref name=\"Housing in Gateshead\" >{{Cite web\n  |title=Housing in Gateshead\n  |url=http://www.gateshead.gov.uk/DocumentLibrary/housing/Leaflets/display_boards.pdf\n  |publisher=Gateshead Council\n  |year=2006\n}}</ref> \"Maisonette\" could also stretch to [[cottage flat]]s, also known as 'four-in-a-block flats', a style of housing common in Scotland.\n\n===One dwelling with two storeys===\n[[File:ScissorFlat.jpg|thumb|Plan of scissor flats.]]\nThe vast majority of apartments are on one level, hence \"flat\". Some, however, have two storeys, joined internally by stairs, just as many houses do. One term for this is \"maisonette\", as above. Some [[public housing in the United Kingdom]] was designed as [[scissor section flat]]s. On a grander level, [[penthouse apartment|penthouses]] may have more than one storey, to emphasise the idea of space and luxury.\n\nTwo storey units in new construction are sometimes referred to as \"[[townhouse]]s\".\n\n===Small buildings with a few one-storey dwellings===\n[[File:CambridgeTripleDecker.jpg|thumb|A triple-decker in New England.]]\n[[File:Dingbat MaryJane.jpg|thumb|left|Dingbat MaryJane]]\n\n\"[[Duplex (building)|Duplex]]\" refers to two separate units with a [[party wall|common demising wall]] or floor-ceiling assembly.\n\nDuplex description can be different depending on the part of the US, but generally has two to four dwellings with a door for each and usually two front doors close together but separate - referred to as '[[Duplex (building)|duplex]]' indicating the number of units, not the number of floors, as in some areas of the country they are often only one story. The term duplex is largely unknown in the UK; there, buildings containing two dwellings with a common vertical wall are known as ''semi-detached'' or just ''a semi'' (the i pronounced \"ee\" not \"eye\"), but the dwellings are usually two storeys (excluding any use of the roof space). This form of construction is very common, and built as such rather than a later conversion.\n\nIn the United States, regional forms have developed, see [[vernacular architecture]]. In [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], a [[Polish flat]] or \"raised cottage\" is an existing small house that has been lifted up to accommodate the creation of a basement floor housing a separate apartment, then set down again, thus becoming a modest pair of dwellings.<ref>{{cite book|editor-first=Sally |editor-last=McMurray |title=People, Power, Places|date=2000|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=9781572330757|page=40|edition=1st}}</ref> In the [[Sun Belt]], boxy small apartment buildings called [[Dingbat (building)|dingbats]], often with [[carport]]s below, sprang up from the 1950s.\n\nGroups of more than two units have corresponding names (Triplex, etc.).{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Those buildings that have a third storey are known as triplexes. See [[Three-decker (house)]]. Again, the term triplex is virtually unknown in the UK.\n\n===Loft apartment===\n[[File:400SGreenLoft.jpg|thumb|The interior of a loft conversion in Chicago]]\n{{Main|Loft#Loft_apartment}}\nThis type of apartment developed in North America during the middle of the 20th century. The term initially described a living space created within a former industrial building, usually 19th century. These large apartments found favor with artists and musicians wanting accommodation in large cities (New York for example) and is related to unused buildings in the decaying parts of such cities being occupied illegally by people [[squatting]].\n\nThese loft apartments were usually located in former highrise warehouses and factories left vacant after town planning rules and economic conditions in the mid 20th century changed. The resulting apartments created a new bohemian lifestyle and are arranged in a completely different way from most urban living spaces, often including workshops and art studio spaces. As the supply of old buildings of a suitable nature has dried up, developers have responded by constructing new buildings in the same aesthetic with varying degrees of success.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nAn industrial, warehouse, or commercial space converted to an apartment is commonly called a ''[[loft]]'', although some modern lofts are built by design.\n\n===Penthouse===\n{{Main|Penthouse apartment}}\nAn apartment located on the top floor of a high-rise apartment building.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Communal apartment===\n{{Main|Communal apartment}}\nIn [[Russia]], a communal apartment (\u00ab\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0443\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0430\u00bb) is a room with a shared kitchen and bath. A typical arrangement is a cluster of five or so room-apartments with a common kitchen and bathroom and separate front doors, occupying a floor in a pre-Revolutionary mansion. Traditionally a room is owned by the government and assigned to a family on a semi-permanent basis.<ref>{{cite web|title=Naherholung gleich ums Eck|url=http://www.terrafinanz.de/brenner-park-sendling|publisher=terrafinanz.de|accessdate=17 June 2013|language=German}}</ref>\n\n===Serviced apartment===\n[[File:PAJASA Service Apartment Mumbai.jpg|thumb|Serviced apartment, Mumbai, India]]\n{{Main|Serviced apartment}}\n{{See also|Apartment hotel|Corporate housing}}\nA \"serviced apartment\" is any size space for residential living which includes regular maid and cleaning services provided by the rental agent. Serviced apartments or serviced flats developed in the early part of the 20th century and were briefly fashionable in the 1920s and 30s. They are intended to combine the best features of luxury and self-contained apartments, often being an adjunct of a [[hotel]]. Like guests semi-permanently installed in a luxury hotel, residents could enjoy the additional facilities such as house keeping, laundry, catering and other services if and when desired.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nA feature of these apartment blocks was quite glamorous interiors with lavish bathrooms but no kitchen or laundry spaces in each flat. This style of living became very fashionable as many upper-class people found they could not afford as many live-in staff after the First World War and revelled in a \"lock-up and leave\" life style that serviced apartment hotels supplied. Some buildings have been subsequently renovated with standard facilities in each apartment, but serviced apartment hotel complexes continue to be constructed. Recently a number of hotels have supplemented their traditional business model with serviced apartment wings, creating privately owned areas within their buildings - either [[freehold (law)|freehold]] or [[leasehold]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Facilities===\n[[File:Laundry Room.jpg|thumb|Laundry Room]]\nApartments may be available for rent furnished, with furniture, or unfurnished into which a tenant moves in with their own furniture. [[Serviced apartment]]s, intended to be convenient for shorter stays, include soft furnishings and [[List of food preparation utensils|kitchen utensils]], and [[maid service]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n[[Laundry#Shared_laundry_rooms|Laundry facilities]] may reside in a common area accessible to all building tenants, or each apartment may have its own facilities. Depending on when the building was built and its design, utilities such as water, heating, and electricity may be common for all of the apartments, or separate for each apartment and billed separately to each tenant. (Many areas in the US have ruled it illegal to split a water bill among all the tenants, especially if a pool is on the premises.) Outlets for connection to telephones are typically included in apartments. Telephone service is optional and is almost always billed separately from the rent payments. Cable television and similar amenities also cost extra. Parking space(s), air conditioning, and extra storage space may or may not be included with an apartment. Rental [[Rental agreement|lease]]s often limit the maximum number of residents in each apartment.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nOn or around the ground floor of the apartment building, a series of [[Letter box|mailbox]]es are typically kept in a location accessible to the public and, thus, to the [[mail carrier]]. Every unit typically gets its own mailbox with individual keys to it. Some very large apartment buildings with a full-time staff may take mail from the carrier and provide mail-sorting service. Near the mailboxes or some other location accessible by outsiders, a buzzer (equivalent to a doorbell) may be available for each individual unit. In smaller apartment buildings such as two- or three-flats, or even four-flats, rubbish is often disposed of in trash containers similar to those used at houses. In larger buildings, rubbish is often collected in a common trash bin or dumpster. For cleanliness or minimizing noise, many lessors will place restrictions on tenants regarding smoking or keeping pets in an apartment.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Various===\n[[File:One-by-five Apartments Austin, TX.jpg|thumb|Mid-rise [[One-plus-five]] style apartment buildings in [[Austin, Texas]].]]\nIn more urban areas, apartments close to the [[downtown]] area have the benefits of proximity to jobs and/or [[public transportation]]. However, prices per square foot are often much higher than in suburban areas.\n\nMoving up from studio flats are one-bedroom apartments, in which a bedroom is separate from the rest of the apartment, followed by two-bedroom, three-bedroom, etc. apartments. (Apartments with more than three bedrooms are rare.)\n\nSmall apartments often have only one entrance.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Large apartments often have two entrances, perhaps a door in the front and another in the back, or from an underground or otherwise attached parking structure. Depending on the building design, the entrance doors may be connected directly to the outside or to a common area inside, such as a hallway or a lobby.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nIn many American cities, the [[One-plus-five]] style of mid-rise, wood-framed apartments have gained significant popularity following a 2009 revision to the [[International Building Code]]; these buildings typically feature four wood-framed floors above a concrete podium and are popular with developers due to their high density and relatively lower construction costs.<ref name=\"Curbed\">{{cite web |url=https://www.curbed.com/2018/12/4/18125536/real-estate-modern-apartment-architecture |title=Why do all new apartment buildings look the same? |author=Sissom, Patrick |work=Curbed |date=4 December 2018 |accessdate=23 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Historical examples==\n\n===Pre-Columbian Americas===\nThe [[Puebloan peoples]] of what is now the Southwestern United States have constructed large, multi-room dwellings, some comprising more than 900 rooms, since the 10th century.\n\nIn the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic Period]] [[Mesoamerica]]n city of [[Teotihuacan]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jarus|first1=Owen|title=Teotihuacan: Ancient City of Pyramids|url=http://www.livescience.com/22545-teotihuacan.html|website=Livescience|publisher=Livescience|accessdate=19 March 2016}}</ref> apartments were not only the standard means of housing the city's population of over 200,000 inhabitants, but show a remarkably even wealth distribution for the entire city, even by contemporary standards.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Michael E.|title=Living the good life in Teotihuacan|url=http://wideurbanworld.blogspot.com/2014/10/living-good-life-in-teotihuacan.html|accessdate=19 March 2016|ref=http://wideurbanworld.blogspot.com/2014/10/living-good-life-in-teotihuacan.html}}</ref> Furthermore, the apartments were inhabited by the general populace as a whole,<ref>{{cite web|title=Teotihuacan|url=http://mexicanhistory.org/Teotihuacan.htm|website=Mexican History|accessdate=19 March 2016}}</ref> in contrast to other Pre-Modern socieites, where apartments were limited to housing the lower class members of the society, as with the somewhat contemporary Roman [[insulae]].\n\n===Ancient Rome===\n[[File:OstianInsula.JPG|thumb|Remains of an Ancient Roman apartment block from the early 2nd century AD in [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]]]]\nIn [[ancient Rome]], the [[insulae]] (singular ''insula'') were large apartment buildings where the lower and middle classes of [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] (the [[plebs]]) dwelled.

Many others were built as [[council flat]]s. Many [[Tower blocks in Great Britain|tower blocks]] were built after the [[Second World War]]. A number of these have been demolished and replaced with low-rise buildings or [[housing estate]]s.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the concept of the flat was slow to catch on amongst the British middle classes, which generally followed the north European standard of single-family houses dating far back into history. Those who lived in flats were assumed to be lower class and somewhat itinerant, renting for example a \"flat above a shop\" as part of a lease agreement for a tradesman. In London and most of Britain, everyone who could afford to do so occupied an entire house\u2014even if this was a small [[terraced house]]\u2014while the working poor continued to rent rooms in often overcrowded properties, with one (or more) families per room.\n\nDuring the last quarter of the 19th century, as wealth increased, ideas began to change. Both urban growth and the increase in population meant that more imaginative housing concepts would be needed if the middle and upper classes were to maintain a {{Lang|fr|[[pied-\u00e0-terre]]}} in the capital. The traditional [[Townhouse (Great Britain)|London town house]] was becoming increasingly expensive to maintain. For bachelors and unmarried women in particular, the idea of renting a modern mansion flat became increasingly popular.\n\nThe first mansion flats in England were:\n*Albert Mansions, which Philip Flower constructed and [[James Thomas Knowles (1831\u20131908)|James Knowles]] designed. These flats were constructed between 1867 and 1870, and were one of the earliest blocks of flats to fill the vacant spaces of the newly-laid out [[Victoria Street, London|Victoria Street]] at the end of the 1860s. Today, only a sliver of the building remains, next to the [[Victoria Palace Theatre]]. Albert Mansions was really 19 separate \"houses\", each with a staircase serving one flat per floor. Its tenants included [[Sir Arthur Sullivan]] and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Lord Alfred Tennyson]], whose connections with the developer's family were long-standing. Philip Flower's son, [[Cyril Flower, 1st Baron Battersea|1st Baron Cyril Flower Battersea]], developed most of the mansion blocks on [[Prince of Wales Drive, London]].\n*Albert Hall Mansions, designed by [[Richard Norman Shaw]] in 1876. Because this was a new type of housing, Shaw reduced risks as much as possible; each block was planned as a separate project, with the building of each part contingent on the successful occupation of every flat in the previous block. The gamble paid off and was a success.\n\n===Scotland===\n[[File:Victorian tenement at Boroughmuirhead, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|[[Tenement]] in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] (1893)]]\n[[File:Tenementedin.jpg|thumb|right|Tenement in Marchmont, Edinburgh, built in 1882]]\nIn [[Scotland]], the term \"[[tenement]]\" lacks the pejorative connotations it carries elsewhere and refers simply to any block of flats sharing a common central staircase and lacking an elevator, particularly those constructed before 1919. Tenements were, and continue to be, inhabited by a wide range of social classes and income groups. Tenements today are bought by a wide range of social types, including young professionals, older [[retirees]], and by [[absentee landlords]], often for rental to students after they leave [[dorm|halls of residence]] managed by their institution. The [[National Trust for Scotland]] [[Tenement House (Glasgow)]] is a [[historic house museum]] offering an insight into the lifestyle of tenement dwellers, as it was generations ago.\n\nDuring the 19th century tenements became the predominant type of new housing in [[Scotland]]'s industrial cities, although they were very common in the [[Old Town, Edinburgh|Old Town]] in Edinburgh from the 15th century, where they reached ten or eleven storeys and in one case fourteen storeys. Built of [[sandstone]] or [[granite]], Scottish tenements are usually three to five storeys in height, with two to four flats on each floor. (In contrast, industrial cities in England tended to favour \"[[Back-to-back houses|back-to-back]]\" [[terraced house|terrace]]s of [[brick]].) Scottish tenements are constructed in terraces, and each entrance within a block is referred to as a ''close'' or ''stair''\u2014both referring to the shared passageway to the individual flats. Flights of stairs and landings are generally designated common areas, and residents traditionally took turns to sweep clean the floors and, in [[Aberdeen]] in particular, took turns to make use of shared laundry facilities in the \"back green\" (garden or yard). It is now more common for cleaning of the common ways to be contracted out through a managing agent or \"factor\".\n\nIn [[Glasgow]], where Scotland's highest concentration of tenement dwellings can be found, the urban renewal projects of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s brought an end to the city's slums, which had primarily consisted of older tenements built in the early 19th century in which large [[extended families]] would live together in cramped conditions. They were replaced by high-rise blocks that, within a couple of decades, became notorious for crime and poverty. The [[Glasgow Corporation]] made many efforts to improve the situation, most successfully with the City Improvement Trust, which cleared the slums of the old town, replacing them with what they thought of as a traditional high street, which remains an imposing townscape. (The City Halls and the [[Cleland Testimonial]] were part of this scheme.) National government help was given following [[World War I]] when Housing Acts sought to provide \"homes fit for heroes\". Garden suburb areas, based on English models, such as [[Knightswood]], were set up. These proved too expensive, so a modern tenement, three stories high, slate roofed and built of reconstituted stone, was re-introduced and a [[slum clearance]] programme initiated to clear areas such as the [[Calton, Glasgow|Calton]] and the [[Garngad]].\n\nAfter [[Second World War|World War II]], more ambitious plans, known as the [[Bruce Plan]], were made for the complete evacuation of slums for modern mid-rise housing developments on the outskirts of the city. However, the central government refused to fund the plans, preferring instead to depopulate the city to a series of [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Towns.]]<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Williamson, E., Riches, A. & Higgs, M.

These housing estates, known as \"schemes\", came therefore to be widely regarded as unsuccessful; many, such as [[Castlemilk]], were just dormitories well away from the centre of the city with no amenities, such as shops and [[public houses]] (\"deserts with windows\", as [[Billy Connolly]] once put it). High-rise living too started off with bright ambition\u2014the Moss Heights, built in the 1950s, are still desirable\u2014but fell prey to later economic pressure. Many of the later tower blocks were poorly designed and cheaply built and their anonymity caused some social problems. The demolition of the tower blocks in order to build modern housing schemes has in some cases led to a re-interpretations of the tenement.\n\nIn 1970 a team from [[Strathclyde University]] demonstrated that the old tenements had been basically sound, and could be given new life with replumbing providing modern kitchens and bathrooms.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> The Corporation acted on this principle for the first time in 1973 at the ''Old Swan Corner'', [[Pollokshaws]]. Thereafter, ''Housing Action Areas'' were set up to renovate so-called slums. Later, privately owned tenements benefited from government help in \"stone cleaning\", revealing a honey-coloured sandstone behind the presumed \"grey\" tenemental facades. The policy of tenement demolition is now considered to have been short-sighted, wasteful and largely unsuccessful. Many of Glasgow's worst tenements were refurbished into desirable accommodation in the 1970s and 1980s<ref>[http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/springburn/spring066.htm Glasgow Digital Library: Demolition of tenements in Gourlay Street, 1975]</ref> and the policy of demolition is considered to have destroyed fine examples of a \"universally admired architectural\" style.<!-- <ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> --> The [[Glasgow Housing Association]] took ownership of the public housing stock from the city council on 7 March 2003, and has begun a \u00a396 million clearance and demolition programme to clear and demolish many of the high-rise flats.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090105180936/http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/News/Archives/2006/May/housingrevolutionannounced.htm Glasgow announces a revolution in house-building] Wednesday 31 May 2006.</ref>\n\n===United States===\n[[File:NewtonMA TheChestnutHill.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Chestnut Hill]], an 1899 apartment house in [[Newton, Massachusetts]]]]\n[[File:East 57th St Apartments.jpg|thumb|right|Apartment buildings lining the residential stretch of East 57th Street between First Avenue and Sutton Place in New York]]\n[[File:LowerEastSideTenements.JPG|thumb|right|[[Tenement]] buildings in [[Manhattan]]'s Lower East Side]]\n\nIn 1839, the first New York City [[tenement]] was built, and soon became breeding grounds for [[outlaw]]s, [[juvenile delinquent]]s, and [[organized crime]]. Tenements, or their slum landlords, were also known for their [[price gouging]] rent. ''How the Other Half Lives'' notes one tenement district:\n\n<blockquote>Blind Man's Alley bear its name for a reason. Until little more than a year ago its dark burrows harbored a colony of blind beggars, tenants of a blind landlord, old Daniel Murphy, whom every child in the ward knows, if he never heard of the President of the United States. \"Old Dan\" made a big fortune--he told me once four hundred thousand dollars-- out of his alley and the surrounding tenements, only to grow blind himself in extreme old age, sharing in the end the chief hardship of the wretched beings whose lot he had stubbornly refused to better that he might increase his wealth. Even when the [[Metropolitan Board of Health|Board of Health]] at last compelled him to repair and clean up the worst of the old buildings, under threat of driving out the tenants and locking the doors behind them, the work was accomplished against the old man's angry protests. He appeared in person before the Board to argue his case, and his argument was characteristic. \"I have made my will,\" he said. \"My monument stands waiting for me in Calvary. I stand on the very brink of the grave, blind and helpless, and now (here the pathos of the appeal was swept under in a burst of angry indignation) do you want me to build and get skinned, skinned? These people are not fit to live in a nice house. Let them go where they can, and let my house stand.\" In spite of the genuine anguish of the appeal, it was downright amusing to find that his anger was provoked less by the anticipated waste of luxury on his tenants than by distrust of his own kind, the builder. He knew intuitively what to expect. The result showed that Mr. Murphy had gauged his tenants correctly.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Riis|first1=Jacob A.|title=How the other half lives : studies among the tenements of New York|date=1890|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York|isbn=9111562986| pages=31\u201332|edition=1st|url=https://archive.org/stream/howotherhalflive00riis_1|accessdate=2 January 2017}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nMany campaigners, such as [[Upton Sinclair]] and [[Jacob Riis]], pushed for reforms in tenement dwellings. As a result, the [[New York State Tenement House Act]] was passed in 1901 to improve the conditions. More improvements followed. In 1949, President [[Harry S. Truman]] signed the [[Housing Act of 1949]] to clean slums and reconstruct housing units for the poor.\n\n[[The Dakota]] (1884) was one of the first luxury apartment buildings in New York City. The majority, however, remained tenements.\n\nSome significant developments in architectural design of apartment buildings came out of the 1950s and '60s.  Among them were groundbreaking designs in the [[860-880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments]] (1951), [[New Century Guild]] (1961), [[Marina City]] (1964) and [[Lake Point Tower]] (1968).\n\nIn the United States, \"tenement\" is a label usually applied to the less expensive, more basic rental apartment buildings in older sections of large cities. Many of these apartment buildings are \"walk-ups\" without an elevator, and some have shared bathing facilities, though this is becoming less common. The slang term \"[[Dingbat (building)|dingbat]]\" is used to describe cheap urban apartment buildings from the 1950s and 1960s with unique and often wacky fa\u00e7ades to differentiate themselves within a full block of apartments. They are often built on stilts, and with parking underneath.\n\n====Property classes====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nIn the United States, properties are typically in one of four property classes, denoted by a letter grade. These grades are used to help [[investor]]s and [[real estate brokers]] speak a common language so they can understand a property's characteristics and condition quickly. They are as follows:\n\n''Class A'' properties are luxury units. They are usually less than 10 years old and are often new, upscale apartment buildings. Average rents are high, and they are generally in desirable geographic areas. [[White-collar worker]]s live in them and are usually renters by choice.\n\n''Class B'' properties can be 10 to 25 years old. They are generally well maintained and have a middle class tenant base of both white- and blue-collar workers. Some are renters by choice, and others by necessity.\n\n''Class C'' properties were built within the last 30 to 40 years. They generally have blue-collar and low- to moderate-income tenants, and the rents are below market. Many tenants are renters \"for life\". On the other hand, some of their tenants are just starting out and are likely to work their way up the rental scale as their income rises.\n\n''Class D'' properties house many [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] (government-subsidized) tenants. They are generally located in lower socioeconomic areas.\n\n===Canada===\nApartments were popular in Canada, particularly in urban centres like Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, and Hamilton in the 1950s to 1970s. By the 1980s, many multi-unit buildings were being constructed as [[condominium]]s instead of apartments\u2014both are now very common. In Toronto and Vancouver, high-rise apartments and condominiums have been spread around the city, giving even the major suburbs a skyline. The robustness of the condo markets in Toronto and Vancouver are based on the lack of land availability.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wang |first=Sissi |url=http://www.canadianbusiness.com/economy/the-latest-threat-to-the-condo-market-apartment-buildings-rise-again/ |title=The latest threat to the condo market: apartment buildings rise again |work=Canadian Business |date=8 July 2015 |accessdate=17 October 2015}}</ref> The average capitalization rate in the Greater Toronto Area for Q3 2015 hit its lowest level in 30 years: in Q3 2015 it stood at 3.75 per cent, down from 4.2 per cent in Q2 2015 and down almost 50 per cent from the 6.3 per cent posted in Q3 2010.<ref>{{cite web |last=DiGianfelice |first=Lorenzo |url=https://www.reminetwork.com/articles/gta-cap-rate-hits-new-benchmark-low/ |title=GTA cap rate hits new benchmark low |work=Canadian Apartment Magazine |date=9 October 2015 |accessdate=17 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Australia===\n[[File:Q1 Q Deck day.JPG|thumb|The skyline of the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in [[Queensland]] is dominated by apartments.]]\n[[File:Canterbury flats st kilda.jpg|thumb|right|The Canterbury in [[St Kilda, Victoria]] is one of the earliest surviving apartment buildings in Australia.]]\n[[File:(1)One Central Park.jpg|thumb|[[One Central Park]], Sydney, which features vertical [[Hanging garden (cultivation)|hanging gardens]] and sustainable [[green design]]]]\n\nApartment buildings in Australia are typically managed by a [[body corporate]] or \"owners corporation\" in which owners pay a monthly fee to provide for common maintenance and help cover future repair. Many apartments are owned through [[strata title]]. Due to legislation, Australian banks will either apply [[loan to value]] ratios of over 70 per cent for strata titles of less than 50 square metres, the [[Big four banks|big four Australian banks]] will not loan at all for strata titles of less than 30 square metres. These are usually classified as studio apartments or student accommodation. Australian legislation enforces a minimum 2.4{{Spaces|fig=}}m floor-ceiling height which differentiates apartment buildings from office buildings.\n\nIn Australia, apartment living is a popular lifestyle choice for [[DINKY]], [[yuppie]]s, [[university student]]s and more recently [[empty nester]]s, however, rising land values in the big cities in recent years has seen an increase in families living in apartments. In [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]] apartment living is sometimes not a matter of choice for the many socially disadvantaged people who often end up in public housing towers.\n\nAustralia has a relatively recent history in apartment buildings. [[Terrace houses]] were the early response to density development, though the majority of Australians lived in fully detached houses. Apartments of any kind were legislated against in the [[Parliament of Queensland]] as part of the [[Undue Subdivision of Land Prevention Act 1885]].\n\nThe earliest apartment buildings were in the major cities of [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]] as the response to fast rising land values\u2013both cities are home to the two oldest surviving apartment buildings in the country, Kingsclere in [[Potts Point]], and The Canterbury Flats in [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]]. [[Melbourne Mansions]] on [[Collins Street, Melbourne]] (now demolished), built in 1906 for mostly wealthy residents is believed by many to be the earliest. Today the oldest surviving self-contained apartment buildings are in the [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]] area including the Fawkner Mansions (1910), Majestic Mansions (1912 as a boarding house) and the Canterbury (1914\u2014the oldest surviving buildings contained flats).<ref>{{cite web |last=Peterson |first=Richard |url=http://www.skhs.org.au/SKHSbuildings/pdf%20files/21.pdf |title=The Canterbury (Flats) - 236 Canterbury Road, St Kilda West |work=A Place of Sensuous Resort: Buildings of St Kilda and Their People |publisher=St Kilda Historical Society |date=2005 |access-date=17 October 2015}}</ref> Kingsclere, built in 1912 is believed to be the earliest apartment building in Sydney and still survives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/heritagensw/win00/8_art.htm |title=High Rise has a past too |publisher=Heritage.nsw.gov.au |accessdate=25 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020628220428/http://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/heritagensw/win00/8_art.htm |archive-date=28 June 2002 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the interwar years, apartment building continued in inner Melbourne (particularly in areas such as St Kilda and [[South Yarra]]), Sydney (particularly in areas such as [[Potts Point, New South Wales|Potts Point]], [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales|Darlinghust]] and [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]]) and in Brisbane (in areas such as [[New Farm, Queensland|New Farm]], [[Fortitude Valley, Queensland|Fortitude Valley]] and [[Spring Hill, Queensland|Spring Hill]]).\n\nPost-[[World War II]], with the [[Australian Dream]] apartment buildings went out of vogue and flats were seen as accommodation only for the poor. Walk-up flats (without a lift) of two to three storeys however were common in the middle suburbs of cities for lower income groups.\n\nThe main exceptions were Sydney and the [[Gold Coast, Queensland]] where apartment development continued for more than half a century. In Sydney a limited geography and highly sought after waterfront views ([[Sydney Harbour]] and beaches such as [[Bondi Beach, New South Wales|Bondi]]) made apartment living socially acceptable. While on the Gold Coast views of the ocean, proximity to the beach and a large tourist population made apartments a popular choice. Since the 1960s, these cities maintained much higher population densities than the rest of Australia through the acceptance of apartment buildings.\n\nIn other cities, apartment building was almost solely restricted to [[public housing]]. [[Public housing in Australia]] was common in the larger cities, particularly in Melbourne (by the [[Housing Commission of Victoria]]) where a huge number of hi-rise housing commission flats were built between the 1950s and 1970s by successive governments as part of an urban renewal program. Areas affected included [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]], [[Flemington, Victoria|Flemington]], [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]], [[Carlton, Victoria|Carlton]], [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]] and [[Prahran, Victoria|Prahran]]. Similar projects were run in Sydney's lower socio-economic areas like [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]].\n\nIn the 1980s, modern apartment buildings sprang up in riverside locations in [[Brisbane]] (along the [[Brisbane River]]) and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] (along the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]]).\n\nIn Melbourne, in the 1990s, a trend began for apartment buildings without the requirement of spectacular views. As a continuation of the [[gentrification]] of the inner city, a fashion became New York \"loft\" style apartments (see above) and a large stock of old warehouses and old abandoned office buildings in and around the central business district became the target of developers. The trend of [[adaptive reuse]] extended to conversion of old churches and schools. Similar warehouse conversions and gentrification began in Brisbane suburbs such as [[Teneriffe, Queensland]] and Fortitude Valley and in Sydney in areas such as [[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]]. As supply of buildings for conversion ran out, reproduction and post modern style apartments followed. The popularity of these apartments also stimulated a boom in the construction of new hi-rise apartment buildings in inner cities. This was particularly the case in Melbourne which was fuelled by official planning policies ([[Postcode 3000]]), making the CBD the fastest growing, population wise in the country. Apartment building in the Melbourne metropolitan area has also escalated with the advent of the [[Melbourne 2030]] planning policy. [[Urban renewal]] areas like [[Melbourne Docklands|Docklands]], [[Southbank, Victoria|Southbank]], [[St Kilda Road]] and [[Port Melbourne]] are now predominantly apartments. There has also been a sharp increase in the number of student apartment buildings in areas such as Carlton in Melbourne.\n\nDespite their size, other smaller cities including [[Canberra]], [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Townsville]], [[Cairns]], [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], [[Wollongong, New South Wales|Wollongong]], [[Adelaide]] and [[Geelong]] have begun building apartments in the 2000s.\n\nToday, residential buildings [[Eureka Tower]] and [[Q1 (building)|Q1]] are the tallest in the country. In many cases, apartments in [[inner city]] areas of the major cities can cost much more than much larger houses in the outer suburbs.\n\nSome Australian cities, such as [[Gold Coast, Queensland]], are inhabited predominantly by apartment dwellers.\n\n===Yugoslavia===\nThe development of residential architecture in [[Yugoslavia]] during the period of [[socialism]] had its peak in the 1960s and 1970s. Significant progress in construction was accompanied by housing research directed towards finding the optimal urbanistic solutions for the newly formed lifestyle of the socialist society. The tendency was to \"pack\" as many [[residential]] units as possible into each building, almost up to the limits of the functional minimum, at the same time with the aim of setting a more humane pattern of living.<ref>Lojanica, V., Risti\u0107, J., Me\u0111o, V.

There are many names for these overall buildings, see below. The [[housing tenure]] of apartments also varies considerably, from large-scale [[public housing]], to [[owner occupancy]] within what is legally a [[condominium]] ([[strata title]] or [[commonhold]]), to tenants renting from a private landlord (see [[leasehold estate]]).\n\n==Terminology==\n===\"Flat\" vs \"apartment\"===\nBoth words refer to a self-contained residential unit with its own front door, kitchen, toilet, and [[bathroom]]. In some parts of the world, the word ''apartment'' refers to a purpose-built unit in a building, whereas the word ''flat'' means a converted unit in an older building, usually a big house.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} In other places the terms are interchangeable.\n\nThe term ''apartment'' is favored in North America (although in some cities ''flat'' is used for a unit which is part of a house containing two or three units, typically one to a floor<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lexico.com/definition/apartment|title=Apartment {{!}} Meaning of Apartment by Lexico|website=Lexico Dictionaries {{!}} English|language=en|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}). In the UK, the term  ''apartment'' is more usual in professional [[real estate]] and [[architectural]] circles where otherwise the term ''flat'' is used commonly, but not exclusively, for an apartment on a single level (hence a 'flat' apartment).\n\nIn some countries, the word \"[[Unit (housing)|unit]]\" is a more general term referring to both apartments and rental business [[Suite (address)|suite]]s. The word 'unit' is generally used only in the context of a specific building; e.g., \"This building has three units\" or \"I'm going to rent a unit in this building\", but not \"I'm going to rent a unit somewhere\".\n\nSome buildings can be characterized as 'mixed-use buildings', meaning part of the building is for commercial, business, or office use, usually on the first floor or first couple of floors, and one or more apartments are found in the rest of the building, usually on the upper floors.\n\n===By housing tenure===\n[[File:St James Town1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Low-income housing]] of the [[St. James Town]] neighborhood in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada]]\n[[File:Cove, Punggol Field.JPG|thumb|right|[[Housing Development Board]] flats in [[Punggol]], [[Singapore]] ]]\n\n([[Condominium]], [[public housing]], [[owner-occupancy]], etc.)\n\n[[Tenement (law)|Tenement law]] refers to the [[feudalism|feudal]] basis of permanent property such as land or rents. It may be found combined as in \"[[Messuage]] or Tenement\" to encompass all the land, buildings and other assets of a property.\n\nIn the United States, some apartment-dwellers own their units, either as a [[housing cooperative]], in which the residents own shares of a corporation that owns the building or development; or in a [[condominium]], whose residents own their apartments and share ownership of the public spaces. Most apartments are in buildings designed for the purpose, but large older [[house]]s are sometimes divided into apartments. The word ''apartment'' denotes a residential unit or section in a building. In some locations, particularly the United States, the word connotes a rental unit owned by the building owner, and is not typically used for a condominium.\n\nIn England and Wales, some flat owners own shares in the company that owns the [[Fee simple|freehold]] of the building as well as holding the flat under a lease.  This arrangement is commonly known as a \"share of freehold\" flat. The freehold company has the right to collect annual ground rents from each of the flat owners in the building. The freeholder can also develop or sell the building, subject to the usual planning and restrictions that might apply. This situation does not happen in Scotland, where long leasehold of residential property was formerly unusual, and is now impossible.<ref>{{cite web| title=Long Leases (Scotland) Act 2012| website=UK Legislation| date=2012| url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2012/9/contents/enacted | accessdate=9 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===By size of the unit===\nBachelor apartment, one-[[bedroom]], etc.; see below.\n\n===By size of the building===\n[[File:English Bay Vancouver.jpg|thumb|right|[[High-rise building]]s in the [[English Bay (Vancouver)|English Bay]] area of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada]]\n[[File:Fatima 0549 (19531851070).jpg|thumb|left|A [[low-rise building]] of flats above shops in [[F\u00e1tima, Portugal]]]]\n\nApartment buildings are [[multi-story]] buildings where three or more residences are contained within one structure. Such a building may be called an ''apartment building'', ''apartment complex'', ''flat complex'', ''block of flats'', ''tower block'', ''high-rise'' or, occasionally, ''mansion block'' (in British English), especially if it consists of many apartments for rent. A high-rise apartment building is commonly referred to as a ''residential tower'', ''apartment tower'', or ''block of flats'' in Australia.\n\nA [[high-rise building]] is defined by its height differently in various [[jurisdiction]]s. It may be only residential, in which case it might also be called a tower block, or it might include other functions such as hotel, offices, or shops. There is no clear difference between a tower block and a [[skyscraper]], although a building with fifty or more stories is generally considered a skyscraper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/547956/skyscraper|title=skyscraper|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc|accessdate=19 September 2012}}</ref> High-rise buildings became possible with the invention of the [[elevator]] (lift) and cheaper, more abundant building materials. Their [[structural system]] usually is made of [[reinforced concrete]] and [[steel]].\n\nA [[low-rise building]] and mid-rise buildings have fewer storeys, but the limits are not always clear. [[Emporis]] defines a low-rise as \"an enclosed structure below 35 metres [115 feet] which is divided into regular floor levels.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://standards.emporis.com/?nav=realestate&lng=3&esn=49213 |title=Data Standards: Structures - low-rise building |publisher=Emporis Standards |accessdate=10 June 2009}}</ref> The city of [[Toronto]] defines a mid-rise as a building between 4 and 12 stories.<ref>http://faculty.geog.utoronto.ca/Hess/Courses/studio/presentation%20on%20avenues%20and%20mid-rise%20study.pdf</ref>\n\n===By country===\nIn [[American English]], the distinction between rental apartments and [[condominium]]s is that while rental buildings are owned by a single entity and rented out to many, condominiums are owned individually, while their owners still pay a monthly or yearly fee for building upkeep. Condominiums are often leased by their owner as rental apartments. A third alternative, the [[Housing cooperative|cooperative apartment]] building (or \"co-op\"), acts as a corporation with all of the tenants as shareholders of the building. Tenants in cooperative buildings do not own their apartment, but instead own a proportional number of shares of the entire cooperative. As in condominiums, cooperators pay a monthly fee for building upkeep. Co-ops are common in cities such as New York, and have gained some popularity in other larger urban areas in the U.S.\n\nIn [[British English]] the usual word is \"flat\", but ''apartment'' is used by property developers to denote expensive 'flats' in exclusive and expensive residential areas in, for example, parts of London such as [[Belgravia]] and [[Hampstead]]. In Scotland, it is called a block of flats or, if it is a traditional sandstone building, a ''[[tenement]]'', a term which has a negative connotation elsewhere.\n\nIn India, the word flat is used to refer to multi-storey dwellings that have lifts.<ref>[https://www.magicbricks.com/flats-in-new-delhi-for-sale-pppfs]</ref>\n\n[[Australian English]] and [[New Zealand English]] traditionally used the term ''flat'' (although it also applies to any rental property), and more recently also use the terms ''unit'' or ''apartment''. In Australia, a 'unit' refers to flats, apartments or even [[semi-detached]] houses. In Australia, the terms \"unit\", \"flat\" and \"apartment\" are largely used interchangeably. Newer high-rise buildings are more often marketed as \"apartments\", as the term \"flats\" carries colloquial connotations. The term condominium or condo is rarely used in Australia despite attempts by developers to market it.\n\nIn [[South African English]], an apartment is usually a single level rental area that is a part of a larger building and can be entered from inside the building through a separate door leading off either a wind tunnel or entrance hall/lobby that is shared with other occupants of the building.\n\nIn [[Malaysian English]], ''flat'' often denotes a housing block of two rooms with walk-up, no lift, without facilities, typically five storeys tall, and with outdoor parking space,<ref>[https://www.propsocial.my/topic/226/categories-of-homes-in-malaysia-posted-by-propsocial-editor?all=1 Categories of Homes in Malaysia.]</ref> while ''apartment'' is more generic and may also include luxury condominiums.\n\nIn Japanese English [[loanword]]s (''[[Wasei-eigo]]''), the term ''apartment'' (''apaato'') is used for lower-income housing and ''mansion'' (''manshon'') is used for high-end apartments; but both terms refer to what English-speakers regard as an apartment (or condominium) and not the level of luxury of a [[mansion]] in English parlance. See [[Housing in Japan]]. ''[[Danchi]]'' is the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word for a large cluster of apartment buildings of a particular style and design, typically built as [[public housing]] by government authorities.\n\n==Types and characteristics==\n===Studio apartment===\n[[File:Cuisinette studio in Sherbrooke April 2010.jpg|thumb|Studio apartment in [[Sherbrooke, Quebec]], Canada, showing double bed, kitchenette, and entrance way with sliding door to closet]]\n{{Main|Studio apartment}}\n{{See also|Microapartment}}\nThe smallest self-contained apartments are referred to as studio, efficiency or bachelor apartments in the US, or studio flat in the UK. These units usually consist of a large single main room which acts as the living room, dining room and bedroom combined and usually also includes kitchen facilities, with a separate bathroom. In Korea, the term \"one room\" (''wonroom'') refers to a studio apartment.<ref>{{cite web | title='Konglish' Not Spoken Here: Asia Society Korea Center Targets Signs and Schoolbooks | website=Asia Society | date=11 October 2012  | url=http://asiasociety.org/blog/asia/konglish-not-spoken-here-asia-society-korea-center-targets-signs-and-schoolbooks | accessdate=5 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nA [[bedsit]] is a UK variant on single room accommodation: a bed-sitting room, probably without cooking facilities, with a shared bathroom. A bedsit is not self-contained and so is not an apartment or flat as this article uses the terms; it forms part of what the UK government calls a [[House in multiple occupation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Private renting: Houses in multiple occupation - GOV.UK|url=https://www.gov.uk/private-renting/houses-in-multiple-occupation|website=www.gov.uk|accessdate=16 April 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Garden apartment (US)===\n[[Merriam-Webster]] defines a garden apartment in [[American English]] as \"a multiple-unit low-rise dwelling having considerable lawn or garden space\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Garden apartment |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/garden%20apartment |website=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |accessdate=29 August 2018}}</ref> The apartment buildings are often arranged around courtyards that are open at one end. Such a garden apartment shares some characteristics of a [[townhouse]]: each apartment has its own building entrance, or shares that entrance via a staircase and lobby that adjoins other units immediately above and/or below it. Unlike a townhouse, each apartment occupies only one level. Such garden apartment buildings are almost never more than three stories high, since they typically lack [[elevator]]s. However, the first \"garden apartment\" buildings in New York, USA, built in the early 1900s, were constructed five stories high.<ref>[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/garden_apartments/ New York City Garden Apartments] retrieved 17 October 2009</ref><ref>Hogan, Meghan.

The interior grounds are often landscaped.\n\n===Garden flat (UK)===\n[[File:Streets of Bayswater.jpg|thumb|[[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] terraced [[townhouse (Great Britain)|townhouses]]. The black railings enclose the basement areas, which in the twentieth century were converted to garden flats.]]\nThe ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines the use of \"garden flat\" in [[British English]] as \"a basement or ground-floor flat with a view of and access to a garden or lawn\", although its citations acknowledge that the reference to a garden may be illusory. \"Garden flat\" can serve simply as a euphemism for a basement. The large [[townhouse (Great Britain)|Georgian or Victorian townhouse]] was built with an excavated subterranean space around its front known as [[Area (architecture)|an area]], often surrounded by cast iron railings. This lowest floor housed the kitchen, the main place of work for the servants, with a \"tradesman's entrance\" via the area stairs. This \"lower ground floor\" (another euphemism) has proven ideal for conversion to a self-contained \"garden flat\". One American term for this arrangement is an [[English basement]].\n\n===Basement apartment===\n{{Main|Basement apartment}}\nGenerally on the lowest floor of a building.\n\n===Secondary suite===\n{{Main|Secondary suite}}\nWhen part of a house is converted for the ostensible use of the owner's family member, the self-contained dwelling may be known as an \"in-law apartment\", \"annexe\", or \"granny flat\", though these (sometimes illegally) created units are often occupied by ordinary renters rather than the landlord's relative. In Canada these are commonly located below the main house and are therefore \"basement suites\".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Another term is an \"accessory dwelling unit\", which may be part of the main house, or a free-standing structure in its grounds.\n\n===Salon apartment===\n''Salon apartment'' is a term linked to the exclusive apartments built as part of multi-family houses in [[Belgrade]] and in certain towns in [[Yugoslavia]] in the first decades of the 20th century.<ref>Alfirevi\u0107 \u0110or\u0111e, Simonovi\u0107 Alfirevi\u0107 San\u0458a.

This is a very common arrangement in much post-War British public housing, serving both to reduce costs by reducing the amount of space given to access corridors and to emulate the 'traditional' two-storey terrace house to which many of the residents would have been accustomed.\n\nA maisonette could encompass [[Tyneside flat]]s, pairs of single-storey flats within a two-storey [[terraced house|terrace]]. Their distinctive feature is their use of two separate front doors onto the street, each door leading to a single flat.<ref name=\"Housing in Gateshead\" >{{Cite web\n  |title=Housing in Gateshead\n  |url=http://www.gateshead.gov.uk/DocumentLibrary/housing/Leaflets/display_boards.pdf\n  |publisher=Gateshead Council\n  |year=2006\n}}</ref> \"Maisonette\" could also stretch to [[cottage flat]]s, also known as 'Four-in-a-block flats', a style of housing common in Scotland.\n\n===One dwelling with two storeys===\n[[File:ScissorFlat.jpg|thumb|Plan of scissor flats.]]\nThe vast majority of apartments are on one level, hence \"flat\". Some, however, have two storeys, joined internally by stairs, just as many houses do. One term for this is \"maisonette\", as above. Some [[public housing in the United Kingdom]] was designed as [[scissor section flat]]s. On a grander level, [[penthouse apartment|penthouses]] may have more than one storey, to emphasise the idea of space and luxury.\n\nTwo storey units in new construction are sometimes referred to as \"[[townhouse]]s\".\n\n===Small buildings with a few one-storey dwellings===\n[[File:CambridgeTripleDecker.jpg|thumb|A triple-decker in New England.]]\n[[File:Dingbat MaryJane.jpg|thumb|left|Dingbat MaryJane]]\n\n\"[[Duplex (building)|Duplex]]\" refers to two separate units with a [[party wall|common demising wall]] or floor-ceiling assembly.\n\nDuplex description can be different depending on the part of the US, but generally has two to four dwellings with a door for each and usually two front doors close together but separate - referred to as '[[Duplex (building)|duplex]]' indicating the number of units, not the number of floors, as in some areas of the country they are often only one story. The term duplex is largely unknown in the UK; there, buildings containing two dwellings with a common vertical wall are known as ''semi-detached'' or just ''a semi'' (the i pronounced \"ee\" not \"eye\"), but the dwellings are usually two storeys (excluding any use of the roof space). This form of construction is very common, and built as such rather than a later conversion.\n\nIn the United States, regional forms have developed, see [[vernacular architecture]]. In [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], a [[Polish flat]] or \"raised cottage\" is an existing small house that has been lifted up to accommodate the creation of a basement floor housing a separate apartment, then set down again, thus becoming a modest pair of dwellings.<ref>{{cite book|editor-first=Sally |editor-last=McMurray |title=People, Power, Places|date=2000|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=9781572330757|page=40|edition=1st}}</ref> In the [[Sun Belt]], boxy small apartment buildings called [[Dingbat (building)|dingbats]], often with [[carport]]s below, sprang up from the 1950s.\n\nGroups of more than two units have corresponding names (Triplex, etc.).{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Those buildings that have a third storey are known as triplexes. See [[Three-decker (house)]]. Again, the term triplex is virtually unknown in the UK.\n\n===Loft apartment===\n[[File:400SGreenLoft.jpg|thumb|The interior of a loft conversion in Chicago]]\n{{Main|Loft#Loft_apartment}}\nThis type of apartment developed in North America during the middle of the 20th century. The term initially described a living space created within a former industrial building, usually 19th century. These large apartments found favor with artists and musicians wanting accommodation in large cities (New York for example) and is related to unused buildings in the decaying parts of such cities being occupied illegally by people [[squatting]].\n\nThese loft apartments were usually located in former highrise warehouses and factories left vacant after town planning rules and economic conditions in the mid 20th century changed. The resulting apartments created a new bohemian lifestyle and are arranged in a completely different way from most urban living spaces, often including workshops and art studio spaces. As the supply of old buildings of a suitable nature has dried up, developers have responded by constructing new buildings in the same aesthetic with varying degrees of success.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nAn industrial, warehouse, or commercial space converted to an apartment is commonly called a ''[[loft]]'', although some modern lofts are built by design.\n\n===Penthouse===\n{{Main|Penthouse apartment}}\nAn apartment located on the top floor of a high-rise apartment building.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Communal apartment===\n{{Main|Communal apartment}}\nIn [[Russia]], a communal apartment (\u00ab\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0443\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0430\u00bb) is a room with a shared kitchen and bath. A typical arrangement is a cluster of five or so room-apartments with a common kitchen and bathroom and separate front doors, occupying a floor in a pre-Revolutionary mansion. Traditionally a room is owned by the government and assigned to a family on a semi-permanent basis.<ref>{{cite web|title=Naherholung gleich ums Eck|url=http://www.terrafinanz.de/brenner-park-sendling|publisher=terrafinanz.de|accessdate=17 June 2013|language=German}}</ref>\n\n===Serviced apartment===\n[[File:PAJASA Service Apartment Mumbai.jpg|thumb|Serviced apartment, Mumbai, India]]\n{{Main|Serviced apartment}}\n{{See also|Apartment hotel|Corporate housing}}\nA \"serviced apartment\" is any size space for residential living which includes regular maid and cleaning services provided by the rental agent. Serviced apartments or serviced flats developed in the early part of the 20th century and were briefly fashionable in the 1920s and 30s. They are intended to combine the best features of luxury and self-contained apartments, often being an adjunct of a [[hotel]]. Like guests semi-permanently installed in a luxury hotel, residents could enjoy the additional facilities such as house keeping, laundry, catering and other services if and when desired.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nA feature of these apartment blocks was quite glamorous interiors with lavish bathrooms but no kitchen or laundry spaces in each flat. This style of living became very fashionable as many upper-class people found they could not afford as many live-in staff after the First World War and revelled in a \"lock-up and leave\" life style that serviced apartment hotels supplied. Some buildings have been subsequently renovated with standard facilities in each apartment, but serviced apartment hotel complexes continue to be constructed. Recently a number of hotels have supplemented their traditional business model with serviced apartment wings, creating privately owned areas within their buildings - either [[freehold (law)|freehold]] or [[leasehold]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Facilities===\n[[File:Laundry Room.jpg|thumb|Laundry Room]]\nApartments may be available for rent furnished, with furniture, or unfurnished into which a tenant moves in with their own furniture. [[Serviced apartment]]s, intended to be convenient for shorter stays, include soft furnishings and [[List of food preparation utensils|kitchen utensils]], and [[maid service]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n[[Laundry#Shared_laundry_rooms|Laundry facilities]] may reside in a common area accessible to all building tenants, or each apartment may have its own facilities. Depending on when the building was built and its design, utilities such as water, heating, and electricity may be common for all of the apartments, or separate for each apartment and billed separately to each tenant. (Many areas in the US have ruled it illegal to split a water bill among all the tenants, especially if a pool is on the premises.) Outlets for connection to telephones are typically included in apartments. Telephone service is optional and is almost always billed separately from the rent payments. Cable television and similar amenities also cost extra. Parking space(s), air conditioning, and extra storage space may or may not be included with an apartment. Rental [[Rental agreement|lease]]s often limit the maximum number of residents in each apartment.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nOn or around the ground floor of the apartment building, a series of [[Letter box|mailbox]]es are typically kept in a location accessible to the public and, thus, to the [[mail carrier]]. Every unit typically gets its own mailbox with individual keys to it. Some very large apartment buildings with a full-time staff may take mail from the carrier and provide mail-sorting service. Near the mailboxes or some other location accessible by outsiders, a buzzer (equivalent to a doorbell) may be available for each individual unit. In smaller apartment buildings such as two- or three-flats, or even four-flats, rubbish is often disposed of in trash containers similar to those used at houses. In larger buildings, rubbish is often collected in a common trash bin or dumpster. For cleanliness or minimizing noise, many lessors will place restrictions on tenants regarding smoking or keeping pets in an apartment.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Various===\n[[File:One-by-five Apartments Austin, TX.jpg|thumb|Mid-rise [[One-plus-five]] style apartment buildings in [[Austin, Texas]].]]\nIn more urban areas, apartments close to the [[downtown]] area have the benefits of proximity to jobs and/or [[public transportation]]. However, prices per square foot are often much higher than in suburban areas.\n\nMoving up from studio flats are one-bedroom apartments, in which a bedroom is separate from the rest of the apartment, followed by two-bedroom, three-bedroom, etc. apartments. (Apartments with more than three bedrooms are rare.)\n\nSmall apartments often have only one entrance.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Large apartments often have two entrances, perhaps a door in the front and another in the back, or from an underground or otherwise attached parking structure. Depending on the building design, the entrance doors may be connected directly to the outside or to a common area inside, such as a hallway or a lobby.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nIn many American cities, the [[One-plus-five]] style of mid-rise, wood-framed apartments have gained significant popularity following a 2009 revision to the [[International Building Code]]; these buildings typically feature four wood-framed floors above a concrete podium and are popular with developers due to their high density and relatively lower construction costs.<ref name=\"Curbed\">{{cite web |url=https://www.curbed.com/2018/12/4/18125536/real-estate-modern-apartment-architecture |title=Why do all new apartment buildings look the same? |author=Sissom, Patrick |work=Curbed |date=4 December 2018 |accessdate=23 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Historical examples==\n\n===Pre-Columbian Americas===\nThe [[Puebloan peoples]] of what is now the Southwestern United States have constructed large, multi-room dwellings, some comprising more than 900 rooms, since the 10th century.\n\nIn the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic Period]] [[Mesoamerica]]n city of [[Teotihuacan]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jarus|first1=Owen|title=Teotihuacan: Ancient City of Pyramids|url=http://www.livescience.com/22545-teotihuacan.html|website=Livescience|publisher=Livescience|accessdate=19 March 2016}}</ref> apartments were not only the standard means of housing the city's population of over 200,000 inhabitants, but show a remarkably even wealth distribution for the entire city, even by contemporary standards.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Michael E.|title=Living the good life in Teotihuacan|url=http://wideurbanworld.blogspot.com/2014/10/living-good-life-in-teotihuacan.html|accessdate=19 March 2016|ref=http://wideurbanworld.blogspot.com/2014/10/living-good-life-in-teotihuacan.html}}</ref> Furthermore, the apartments were inhabited by the general populace as a whole,<ref>{{cite web|title=Teotihuacan|url=http://mexicanhistory.org/Teotihuacan.htm|website=Mexican History|accessdate=19 March 2016}}</ref> in contrast to other Pre-Modern socieites, where apartments were limited to housing the lower class members of the society, as with the somewhat contemporary Roman [[insulae]].\n\n===Ancient Rome===\n[[File:OstianInsula.JPG|thumb|Remains of an Ancient Roman apartment block from the early 2nd century AD in [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]]]]\nIn [[ancient Rome]], the [[insulae]] (singular ''insula'') were large apartment buildings where the lower and middle classes of [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] (the [[plebs]]) dwelled.

A number of these have been demolished and replaced with low-rise buildings or [[housing estate]]s.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the concept of the flat was slow to catch on amongst the British middle classes, which generally followed the north European standard of single-family houses dating far back into history. Those who lived in flats were assumed to be lower class and somewhat itinerant, renting for example a \"flat above a shop\" as part of a lease agreement for a tradesman. In London and most of Britain, everyone who could afford to do so occupied an entire house\u2014even if this was a small [[terraced house]]\u2014while the working poor continued to rent rooms in often overcrowded properties, with one (or more) families per room.\n\nDuring the last quarter of the 19th century, as wealth increased, ideas began to change. Both urban growth and the increase in population meant that more imaginative housing concepts would be needed if the middle and upper classes were to maintain a {{Lang|fr|[[pied-\u00e0-terre]]}} in the capital. The traditional [[Townhouse (Great Britain)|London town house]] was becoming increasingly expensive to maintain. For bachelors and unmarried women in particular, the idea of renting a modern mansion flat became increasingly popular.\n\nThe first mansion flats in England were:\n*Albert Mansions, which Philip Flower constructed and [[James Thomas Knowles (1831\u20131908)|James Knowles]] designed. These flats were constructed between 1867 and 1870, and were one of the earliest blocks of flats to fill the vacant spaces of the newly-laid out [[Victoria Street, London|Victoria Street]] at the end of the 1860s. Today, only a sliver of the building remains, next to the [[Victoria Palace Theatre]]. Albert Mansions was really 19 separate \"houses\", each with a staircase serving one flat per floor. Its tenants included [[Sir Arthur Sullivan]] and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Lord Alfred Tennyson]], whose connections with the developer's family were long-standing. Philip Flower's son, [[Cyril Flower, 1st Baron Battersea|1st Baron Cyril Flower Battersea]], developed most of the mansion blocks on [[Prince of Wales Drive, London]].\n*Albert Hall Mansions, designed by [[Richard Norman Shaw]] in 1876. Because this was a new type of housing, Shaw reduced risks as much as possible; each block was planned as a separate project, with the building of each part contingent on the successful occupation of every flat in the previous block. The gamble paid off and was a success.\n\n===Scotland===\n[[File:Victorian tenement at Boroughmuirhead, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|[[Tenement]] in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] (1893)]]\n[[File:Tenementedin.jpg|thumb|right|Tenement in Marchmont, Edinburgh, built in 1882]]\nIn [[Scotland]], the term \"[[tenement]]\" lacks the pejorative connotations it carries elsewhere and refers simply to any block of flats sharing a common central staircase and lacking an elevator, particularly those constructed before 1919. Tenements were, and continue to be, inhabited by a wide range of social classes and income groups. Tenements today are bought by a wide range of social types, including young professionals, older [[retirees]], and by [[absentee landlords]], often for rental to students after they leave [[dorm|halls of residence]] managed by their institution. The [[National Trust for Scotland]] [[Tenement House (Glasgow)]] is a [[historic house museum]] offering an insight into the lifestyle of tenement dwellers, as it was generations ago.\n\nDuring the 19th century tenements became the predominant type of new housing in [[Scotland]]'s industrial cities, although they were very common in the [[Old Town, Edinburgh|Old Town]] in Edinburgh from the 15th century, where they reached ten or eleven storeys and in one case fourteen storeys. Built of [[sandstone]] or [[granite]], Scottish tenements are usually three to five storeys in height, with two to four flats on each floor. (In contrast, industrial cities in England tended to favour \"[[Back-to-back houses|back-to-back]]\" [[terraced house|terrace]]s of [[brick]].) Scottish tenements are constructed in terraces, and each entrance within a block is referred to as a ''close'' or ''stair''\u2014both referring to the shared passageway to the individual flats. Flights of stairs and landings are generally designated common areas, and residents traditionally took turns to sweep clean the floors and, in [[Aberdeen]] in particular, took turns to make use of shared laundry facilities in the \"back green\" (garden or yard). It is now more common for cleaning of the common ways to be contracted out through a managing agent or \"factor\".\n\nIn [[Glasgow]], where Scotland's highest concentration of tenement dwellings can be found, the urban renewal projects of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s brought an end to the city's slums, which had primarily consisted of older tenements built in the early 19th century in which large [[extended families]] would live together in cramped conditions. They were replaced by high-rise blocks that, within a couple of decades, became notorious for crime and poverty. The [[Glasgow Corporation]] made many efforts to improve the situation, most successfully with the City Improvement Trust, which cleared the slums of the old town, replacing them with what they thought of as a traditional high street, which remains an imposing townscape. (The City Halls and the [[Cleland Testimonial]] were part of this scheme.) National government help was given following [[World War I]] when Housing Acts sought to provide \"homes fit for heroes\". Garden suburb areas, based on English models, such as [[Knightswood]], were set up. These proved too expensive, so a modern tenement, three stories high, slate roofed and built of reconstituted stone, was re-introduced and a [[slum clearance]] programme initiated to clear areas such as the [[Calton, Glasgow|Calton]] and the [[Garngad]].\n\nAfter [[Second World War|World War II]], more ambitious plans, known as the [[Bruce Plan]], were made for the complete evacuation of slums for modern mid-rise housing developments on the outskirts of the city. However, the central government refused to fund the plans, preferring instead to depopulate the city to a series of [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Towns.]]<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Williamson, E., Riches, A. & Higgs, M.

These housing estates, known as \"schemes\", came therefore to be widely regarded as unsuccessful; many, such as [[Castlemilk]], were just dormitories well away from the centre of the city with no amenities, such as shops and [[public houses]] (\"deserts with windows\", as [[Billy Connolly]] once put it). High-rise living too started off with bright ambition\u2014the Moss Heights, built in the 1950s, are still desirable\u2014but fell prey to later economic pressure. Many of the later tower blocks were poorly designed and cheaply built and their anonymity caused some social problems. The demolition of the tower blocks in order to build modern housing schemes has in some cases led to a re-interpretations of the tenement.\n\nIn 1970 a team from [[Strathclyde University]] demonstrated that the old tenements had been basically sound, and could be given new life with replumbing providing modern kitchens and bathrooms.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> The Corporation acted on this principle for the first time in 1973 at the ''Old Swan Corner'', [[Pollokshaws]]. Thereafter, ''Housing Action Areas'' were set up to renovate so-called slums. Later, privately owned tenements benefited from government help in \"stone cleaning\", revealing a honey-coloured sandstone behind the presumed \"grey\" tenemental facades. The policy of tenement demolition is now considered to have been short-sighted, wasteful and largely unsuccessful. Many of Glasgow's worst tenements were refurbished into desirable accommodation in the 1970s and 1980s<ref>[http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/springburn/spring066.htm Glasgow Digital Library: Demolition of tenements in Gourlay Street, 1975]</ref> and the policy of demolition is considered to have destroyed fine examples of a \"universally admired architectural\" style.<!-- <ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> --> The [[Glasgow Housing Association]] took ownership of the public housing stock from the city council on 7 March 2003, and has begun a \u00a396 million clearance and demolition programme to clear and demolish many of the high-rise flats.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090105180936/http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/News/Archives/2006/May/housingrevolutionannounced.htm Glasgow announces a revolution in house-building] Wednesday 31 May 2006.</ref>\n\n===United States===\n[[File:NewtonMA TheChestnutHill.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Chestnut Hill]], an 1899 apartment house in [[Newton, Massachusetts]]]]\n[[File:East 57th St Apartments.jpg|thumb|right|Apartment buildings lining the residential stretch of East 57th Street between First Avenue and Sutton Place in New York]]\n[[File:LowerEastSideTenements.JPG|thumb|right|[[Tenement]] buildings in [[Manhattan]]'s Lower East Side]]\n\nIn 1839, the first New York City [[tenement]] was built, and soon became breeding grounds for [[outlaw]]s, [[juvenile delinquent]]s, and [[organized crime]]. Tenements, or their slum landlords, were also known for their [[price gouging]] rent. ''How the Other Half Lives'' notes one tenement district:\n\n<blockquote>Blind Man's Alley bear its name for a reason. Until little more than a year ago its dark burrows harbored a colony of blind beggars, tenants of a blind landlord, old Daniel Murphy, whom every child in the ward knows, if he never heard of the President of the United States. \"Old Dan\" made a big fortune--he told me once four hundred thousand dollars-- out of his alley and the surrounding tenements, only to grow blind himself in extreme old age, sharing in the end the chief hardship of the wretched beings whose lot he had stubbornly refused to better that he might increase his wealth. Even when the [[Metropolitan Board of Health|Board of Health]] at last compelled him to repair and clean up the worst of the old buildings, under threat of driving out the tenants and locking the doors behind them, the work was accomplished against the old man's angry protests. He appeared in person before the Board to argue his case, and his argument was characteristic. \"I have made my will,\" he said. \"My monument stands waiting for me in Calvary. I stand on the very brink of the grave, blind and helpless, and now (here the pathos of the appeal was swept under in a burst of angry indignation) do you want me to build and get skinned, skinned? These people are not fit to live in a nice house. Let them go where they can, and let my house stand.\" In spite of the genuine anguish of the appeal, it was downright amusing to find that his anger was provoked less by the anticipated waste of luxury on his tenants than by distrust of his own kind, the builder. He knew intuitively what to expect. The result showed that Mr. Murphy had gauged his tenants correctly.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Riis|first1=Jacob A.|title=How the other half lives : studies among the tenements of New York|date=1890|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York|isbn=9111562986| pages=31\u201332|edition=1st|url=https://archive.org/stream/howotherhalflive00riis_1|accessdate=2 January 2017}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nMany campaigners, such as [[Upton Sinclair]] and [[Jacob Riis]], pushed for reforms in tenement dwellings. As a result, the [[New York State Tenement House Act]] was passed in 1901 to improve the conditions. More improvements followed. In 1949, President [[Harry S. Truman]] signed the [[Housing Act of 1949]] to clean slums and reconstruct housing units for the poor.\n\n[[The Dakota]] (1884) was one of the first luxury apartment buildings in New York City. The majority, however, remained tenements.\n\nSome significant developments in architectural design of apartment buildings came out of the 1950s and '60s.  Among them were groundbreaking designs in the [[860-880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments]] (1951), [[New Century Guild]] (1961), [[Marina City]] (1964) and [[Lake Point Tower]] (1968).\n\nIn the United States, \"tenement\" is a label usually applied to the less expensive, more basic rental apartment buildings in older sections of large cities. Many of these apartment buildings are \"walk-ups\" without an elevator, and some have shared bathing facilities, though this is becoming less common. The slang term \"[[Dingbat (building)|dingbat]]\" is used to describe cheap urban apartment buildings from the 1950s and 1960s with unique and often wacky fa\u00e7ades to differentiate themselves within a full block of apartments. They are often built on stilts, and with parking underneath.\n\n====Property classes====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nIn the United States, properties are typically in one of four property classes, denoted by a letter grade. These grades are used to help [[investor]]s and [[real estate brokers]] speak a common language so they can understand a property's characteristics and condition quickly. They are as follows:\n\n''Class A'' properties are luxury units. They are usually less than 10 years old and are often new, upscale apartment buildings. Average rents are high, and they are generally in desirable geographic areas. [[White-collar worker]]s live in them and are usually renters by choice.\n\n''Class B'' properties can be 10 to 25 years old. They are generally well maintained and have a middle class tenant base of both white- and blue-collar workers. Some are renters by choice, and others by necessity.\n\n''Class C'' properties were built within the last 30 to 40 years. They generally have blue-collar and low- to moderate-income tenants, and the rents are below market. Many tenants are renters \"for life\". On the other hand, some of their tenants are just starting out and are likely to work their way up the rental scale as their income rises.\n\n''Class D'' properties house many [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] (government-subsidized) tenants. They are generally located in lower socioeconomic areas.\n\n===Canada===\nApartments were popular in Canada, particularly in urban centres like Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, and Hamilton in the 1950s to 1970s. By the 1980s, many multi-unit buildings were being constructed as [[condominium]]s instead of apartments\u2014both are now very common. In Toronto and Vancouver, high-rise apartments and condominiums have been spread around the city, giving even the major suburbs a skyline. The robustness of the condo markets in Toronto and Vancouver are based on the lack of land availability.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wang |first=Sissi |url=http://www.canadianbusiness.com/economy/the-latest-threat-to-the-condo-market-apartment-buildings-rise-again/ |title=The latest threat to the condo market: apartment buildings rise again |work=Canadian Business |date=8 July 2015 |accessdate=17 October 2015}}</ref> The average capitalization rate in the Greater Toronto Area for Q3 2015 hit its lowest level in 30 years: in Q3 2015 it stood at 3.75 per cent, down from 4.2 per cent in Q2 2015 and down almost 50 per cent from the 6.3 per cent posted in Q3 2010.<ref>{{cite web |last=DiGianfelice |first=Lorenzo |url=https://www.reminetwork.com/articles/gta-cap-rate-hits-new-benchmark-low/ |title=GTA cap rate hits new benchmark low |work=Canadian Apartment Magazine |date=9 October 2015 |accessdate=17 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Australia===\n[[File:Q1 Q Deck day.JPG|thumb|The skyline of the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in [[Queensland]] is dominated by apartments.]]\n[[File:Canterbury flats st kilda.jpg|thumb|right|The Canterbury in [[St Kilda, Victoria]] is one of the earliest surviving apartment buildings in Australia.]]\n[[File:(1)One Central Park.jpg|thumb|[[One Central Park]], Sydney, which features vertical [[Hanging garden (cultivation)|hanging gardens]] and sustainable [[green design]]]]\n\nApartment buildings in Australia are typically managed by a [[body corporate]] or \"owners corporation\" in which owners pay a monthly fee to provide for common maintenance and help cover future repair. Many apartments are owned through [[strata title]]. Due to legislation, Australian banks will either apply [[loan to value]] ratios of over 70 per cent for strata titles of less than 50 square metres, the [[Big four banks|big four Australian banks]] will not loan at all for strata titles of less than 30 square metres. These are usually classified as studio apartments or student accommodation. Australian legislation enforces a minimum 2.4{{Spaces|fig=}}m floor-ceiling height which differentiates apartment buildings from office buildings.\n\nIn Australia, apartment living is a popular lifestyle choice for [[DINKY]], [[yuppie]]s, [[university student]]s and more recently [[empty nester]]s, however, rising land values in the big cities in recent years has seen an increase in families living in apartments. In [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]] apartment living is sometimes not a matter of choice for the many socially disadvantaged people who often end up in public housing towers.\n\nAustralia has a relatively recent history in apartment buildings. [[Terrace houses]] were the early response to density development, though the majority of Australians lived in fully detached houses. Apartments of any kind were legislated against in the [[Parliament of Queensland]] as part of the [[Undue Subdivision of Land Prevention Act 1885]].\n\nThe earliest apartment buildings were in the major cities of [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]] as the response to fast rising land values\u2013both cities are home to the two oldest surviving apartment buildings in the country, Kingsclere in [[Potts Point]], and The Canterbury Flats in [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]]. [[Melbourne Mansions]] on [[Collins Street, Melbourne]] (now demolished), built in 1906 for mostly wealthy residents is believed by many to be the earliest. Today the oldest surviving self-contained apartment buildings are in the [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]] area including the Fawkner Mansions (1910), Majestic Mansions (1912 as a boarding house) and the Canterbury (1914\u2014the oldest surviving buildings contained flats).<ref>{{cite web |last=Peterson |first=Richard |url=http://www.skhs.org.au/SKHSbuildings/pdf%20files/21.pdf |title=The Canterbury (Flats) - 236 Canterbury Road, St Kilda West |work=A Place of Sensuous Resort: Buildings of St Kilda and Their People |publisher=St Kilda Historical Society |date=2005 |access-date=17 October 2015}}</ref> Kingsclere, built in 1912 is believed to be the earliest apartment building in Sydney and still survives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/heritagensw/win00/8_art.htm |title=High Rise has a past too |publisher=Heritage.nsw.gov.au |accessdate=25 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020628220428/http://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/heritagensw/win00/8_art.htm |archive-date=28 June 2002 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the interwar years, apartment building continued in inner Melbourne (particularly in areas such as St Kilda and [[South Yarra]]), Sydney (particularly in areas such as [[Potts Point, New South Wales|Potts Point]], [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales|Darlinghust]] and [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]]) and in Brisbane (in areas such as [[New Farm, Queensland|New Farm]], [[Fortitude Valley, Queensland|Fortitude Valley]] and [[Spring Hill, Queensland|Spring Hill]]).\n\nPost-[[World War II]], with the [[Australian Dream]] apartment buildings went out of vogue and flats were seen as accommodation only for the poor. Walk-up flats (without a lift) of two to three storeys however were common in the middle suburbs of cities for lower income groups.\n\nThe main exceptions were Sydney and the [[Gold Coast, Queensland]] where apartment development continued for more than half a century. In Sydney a limited geography and highly sought after waterfront views ([[Sydney Harbour]] and beaches such as [[Bondi Beach, New South Wales|Bondi]]) made apartment living socially acceptable. While on the Gold Coast views of the ocean, proximity to the beach and a large tourist population made apartments a popular choice. Since the 1960s, these cities maintained much higher population densities than the rest of Australia through the acceptance of apartment buildings.\n\nIn other cities, apartment building was almost solely restricted to [[public housing]]. [[Public housing in Australia]] was common in the larger cities, particularly in Melbourne (by the [[Housing Commission of Victoria]]) where a huge number of hi-rise housing commission flats were built between the 1950s and 1970s by successive governments as part of an urban renewal program. Areas affected included [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]], [[Flemington, Victoria|Flemington]], [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]], [[Carlton, Victoria|Carlton]], [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]] and [[Prahran, Victoria|Prahran]]. Similar projects were run in Sydney's lower socio-economic areas like [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]].\n\nIn the 1980s, modern apartment buildings sprang up in riverside locations in [[Brisbane]] (along the [[Brisbane River]]) and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] (along the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]]).\n\nIn Melbourne, in the 1990s, a trend began for apartment buildings without the requirement of spectacular views. As a continuation of the [[gentrification]] of the inner city, a fashion became New York \"loft\" style apartments (see above) and a large stock of old warehouses and old abandoned office buildings in and around the central business district became the target of developers. The trend of [[adaptive reuse]] extended to conversion of old churches and schools. Similar warehouse conversions and gentrification began in Brisbane suburbs such as [[Teneriffe, Queensland]] and Fortitude Valley and in Sydney in areas such as [[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]]. As supply of buildings for conversion ran out, reproduction and post modern style apartments followed. The popularity of these apartments also stimulated a boom in the construction of new hi-rise apartment buildings in inner cities. This was particularly the case in Melbourne which was fuelled by official planning policies ([[Postcode 3000]]), making the CBD the fastest growing, population wise in the country. Apartment building in the Melbourne metropolitan area has also escalated with the advent of the [[Melbourne 2030]] planning policy. [[Urban renewal]] areas like [[Melbourne Docklands|Docklands]], [[Southbank, Victoria|Southbank]], [[St Kilda Road]] and [[Port Melbourne]] are now predominantly apartments. There has also been a sharp increase in the number of student apartment buildings in areas such as Carlton in Melbourne.\n\nDespite their size, other smaller cities including [[Canberra]], [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Townsville]], [[Cairns]], [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], [[Wollongong, New South Wales|Wollongong]], [[Adelaide]] and [[Geelong]] have begun building apartments in the 2000s.\n\nToday, residential buildings [[Eureka Tower]] and [[Q1 (building)|Q1]] are the tallest in the country. In many cases, apartments in [[inner city]] areas of the major cities can cost much more than much larger houses in the outer suburbs.\n\nSome Australian cities, such as [[Gold Coast, Queensland]], are inhabited predominantly by apartment dwellers.\n\n===Yugoslavia===\nThe development of residential architecture in [[Yugoslavia]] during the period of [[socialism]] had its peak in the 1960s and 1970s. Significant progress in construction was accompanied by housing research directed towards finding the optimal urbanistic solutions for the newly formed lifestyle of the socialist society. The tendency was to \"pack\" as many [[residential]] units as possible into each building, almost up to the limits of the functional minimum, at the same time with the aim of setting a more humane pattern of living.<ref>Lojanica, V., Risti\u0107, J., Me\u0111o, V.

Versions 1 through to 7.4 were developed by FNS.  Satellite functionality was integrated into the Base Software in sub-versions from customer sites via the Redfern Projects Office.\n\nTwo major branches were developed using elements from version 2 through 4 of the core.

The Himalayan kingdom was connected to India through a district of the Punjab, but its population was 77 per cent Muslim and it shared a boundary with Pakistan. Hence, it was anticipated that the maharaja would accede to Pakistan when the British paramountcy ended on 14\u201315 August. When he hesitated to do this, Pakistan launched a guerrilla onslaught meant to frighten its ruler into submission. Instead the Maharaja appealed to [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Mountbatten]]<ref>Viscount Louis Mountbatten, the last Viceroy of British India, stayed on in independent India from 1947 to 1948, serving as the first Governor-General of the Union of India.</ref> for assistance, and the [[Governor-General of India|governor-general]] agreed on the condition that the ruler accede to India. Indian soldiers entered Kashmir and drove the Pakistani-sponsored irregulars from all but a small section of the state. The United Nations was then invited to mediate the quarrel. The UN mission insisted that the opinion of Kashmiris must be ascertained, while India insisted that no referendum could occur until all of the state had been cleared of irregulars.<ref name=\"stein\">Stein, Burton. 2010. ''A History of India''. Oxford University Press. 432 pages. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-9509-6}}. Page 358.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the last days of 1948, a ceasefire was agreed under UN auspices. However, since the [[referendum]] demanded by the UN was never conducted, relations between India and Pakistan soured,<ref name=\"stein\" /> and eventually led to two more wars over Kashmir in [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]] and [[Kargil War|1999]].\n\n[[File:Kashmir top.jpg|thumb|[[Topographic map]] of Kashmir]]\n\n===Current status and political divisions===\n{{Main|Aksai Chin|Azad Kashmir|Jammu and Kashmir (union territory)|Ladakh|Gilgit\u2013Baltistan|Trans-Karakoram Tract}}\nIndia has control of about half the area of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, which continues the name [[Jammu and Kashmir (union territory)|Jammu and Kashmir]], while Pakistan controls a third of the region, divided into two ''de facto'' provinces, [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] and [[Azad Kashmir]].\n\nAccording to the ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', \"Although there was a clear Muslim majority in Kashmir before the 1947 partition and its economic, cultural, and geographic contiguity with the Muslim-majority area of the Punjab (in Pakistan) could be convincingly demonstrated, the political developments during and after the partition resulted in a division of the region. Pakistan was left with territory that, although basically Muslim in character, was thinly populated, relatively inaccessible, and economically underdeveloped. The largest Muslim group, situated in the Valley of Kashmir and estimated to number more than half the population of the entire region, lay in Indian-administered territory, with its former outlets via the Jhelum valley route blocked.\"<ref name=\"britannica-kashmir\" />\n\nThe eastern region of the former princely state of Kashmir is also involved in a boundary dispute that began in the late 19th century and continues into the 21st. Although some boundary agreements were signed between Great Britain, Afghanistan and Russia over the northern borders of Kashmir, China never accepted these agreements, and China's official position has not changed following the [[Chinese Communist Revolution|communist revolution of 1949]] that established the People's Republic of China.

Geographically part of the [[Tibetan Plateau]], Aksai Chin is referred to as the Soda Plain.

India claims those areas, including the area \"ceded\" to China by Pakistan in the [[Trans-Karakoram Tract]] in 1963, are a part of its territory, while Pakistan claims the entire region excluding Aksai Chin and Trans-Karakoram Tract. The two countries have fought several declared wars over the territory. The [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947]] established the rough boundaries of today, with Pakistan holding roughly one-third of Kashmir, and India one-half, with a dividing line of control established by the United Nations. The [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]] resulted in a stalemate and a UN-negotiated ceasefire.\n\n==Demographics==\nIn the 1901 Census of the British [[British Raj|Indian Empire]], the population of the [[princely state]] of ''Kashmir and Jammu'' was 2,905,578.

Traditionally the staple crop of the valley was rice, which formed the chief food of the people. In addition, Indian corn, wheat, barley and oats were also grown. Given its [[temperate climate]], it is suited for crops like [[asparagus]], artichoke, seakale, broad beans, scarletrunners, beetroot, cauliflower and cabbage. Fruit trees are common in the valley, and the cultivated orchards yield pears, apples, [[peach]]es, and cherries. The chief trees are [[Cedrus deodara|deodar]], firs and [[pine]]s, [[Platanus orientalis|chenar]] or plane, maple, birch and [[walnut]], apple, cherry.\n\nHistorically, Kashmir became known worldwide when [[Cashmere wool]] was exported to other regions and nations (exports have ceased due to decreased abundance of the cashmere goat and increased competition from China). Kashmiris are well adept at [[knitting]] and making [[Pashmina]] [[shawl]]s, silk carpets, rugs, [[kurta]]s, and pottery. [[Saffron]], too, is grown in Kashmir. Srinagar is known for its silver-work, [[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]], wood-carving, and the weaving of silk. The economy was badly damaged by the [[2005 Kashmir earthquake]] which, as of 8 October 2005, resulted in over 70,000 deaths in the Pakistan-controlled part of Kashmir and around 1,500 deaths in Indian-controlled Kashmir.\n\n{{Wide image|Srinagar pano.jpg|800px|Srinagar, the largest city of Kashmir|center}}\n\n===Transport===\nTransport is predominantly by air or road vehicles in the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bharatonline.com/kashmir/travel-tips/local-transport.html |title=Local Transport in Kashmir \u2013 Means of Transportation Kashmir \u2013 Mode of Transportation Kashmir India |publisher=Bharatonline.com |accessdate=3 August 2012}}</ref> Kashmir has a {{convert|135|km|abbr=on|0}} long modern [[Jammu\u2013Baramulla line|railway]] line that started in October 2009, and was last extended in 2013 and connects Baramulla, in the western part of Kashmir, to Srinagar and [[Banihal]].

The Himalayan kingdom was connected to India through a district of the Punjab, but its population was 77 per cent Muslim and it shared a boundary with Pakistan. Hence, it was anticipated that the maharaja would accede to Pakistan when the British paramountcy ended on 14\u201315 August. When he hesitated to do this, Pakistan launched a guerrilla onslaught meant to frighten its ruler into submission. Instead the Maharaja appealed to [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Mountbatten]]<ref>Viscount Louis Mountbatten, the last Viceroy of British India, stayed on in independent India from 1947 to 1948, serving as the first Governor-General of the Union of India.</ref> for assistance, and the [[Governor-General of India|governor-general]] agreed on the condition that the ruler accede to India. Indian soldiers entered Kashmir and drove the Pakistani-sponsored irregulars from all but a small section of the state. The United Nations was then invited to mediate the quarrel. The UN mission insisted that the opinion of Kashmiris must be ascertained, while India insisted that no referendum could occur until all of the state had been cleared of irregulars.<ref name=\"stein\">Stein, Burton. 2010.

Of these, 2,154,695 (74.16%) were Muslims, 689,073 (23.72%) Hindus, 25,828 (0.89%) Sikhs, and 35,047 (1.21%) [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] (implying 935 (0.032%) others).\n\nThe [[Hindu]]s were found mainly in [[Jammu Division|Jammu]], where they constituted a little less than 60% of the population.<ref name=imperialgazetteerkashmir>''Imperial Gazetteer of India, volume 15''. 1908.

In the last census of British India in 1941, the total population of Kashmir and Jammu (which as a result of the second world war, was estimated from the 1931 census) was 3,945,000. Of these, the total Muslim population was 2,997,000 (75.97%), the Hindu population was 808,000 (20.48%), and the Sikh 55,000 (1.39%).<ref name = brush>{{cite journal | last1 = Brush | first1 = J.

Traditionally the staple crop of the valley was rice, which formed the chief food of the people. In addition, Indian corn, wheat, barley and oats were also grown. Given its [[temperate climate]], it is suited for crops like [[asparagus]], artichoke, seakale, broad beans, scarletrunners, beetroot, cauliflower and cabbage. Fruit trees are common in the valley, and the cultivated orchards yield pears, apples, [[peach]]es, and cherries. The chief trees are [[Cedrus deodara|deodar]], firs and [[pine]]s, [[Platanus orientalis|chenar]] or plane, maple, birch and [[walnut]], apple, cherry.\n\nHistorically, Kashmir became known worldwide when [[Cashmere wool]] was exported to other regions and nations (exports have ceased due to decreased abundance of the cashmere goat and increased competition from China). Kashmiris are well adept at [[knitting]] and making [[Pashmina]] [[shawl]]s, silk carpets, rugs, [[kurta]]s, and pottery. [[Saffron]], too, is grown in Kashmir. Srinagar is known for its silver-work, [[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]], wood-carving, and the weaving of silk. The economy was badly damaged by the [[2005 Kashmir earthquake]] which, as of 8 October 2005, resulted in over 70,000 deaths in the Pakistan-controlled part of Kashmir and around 1,500 deaths in Indian-controlled Kashmir.\n\n{{Wide image|Srinagar pano.jpg|800px|Srinagar, the largest city of Kashmir|center}}\n\n===Transport===\nTransport is predominantly by air or road vehicles in the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bharatonline.com/kashmir/travel-tips/local-transport.html |title=Local Transport in Kashmir \u2013 Means of Transportation Kashmir \u2013 Mode of Transportation Kashmir India |publisher=Bharatonline.com |accessdate=3 August 2012}}</ref> Kashmir has a {{convert|135|km|abbr=on|0}} long modern [[Jammu\u2013Baramulla line|railway]] line that started in October 2009, and was last extended in 2013 and connects Baramulla, in the western part of Kashmir, to Srinagar and [[Banihal]].
