Upon hearing the beat, given to him by St. Louis producer Antoine \"Bam\" Macon, Nelly began writing lyrics and then wrote a song out from it. He then decided to make the song a last-minute addition to his second album ''[[Nellyville]]'', which had already been completed prior to Bam giving him the track.<ref name=\"MossMaking\">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1470044/20030220/nelly.jhtml|title=Road To The Grammys: The Making Of Nelly's 'Dilemma'|last=Moss|first=Corey|date=2003-02-20|publisher=MTV|accessdate=2009-02-23}}</ref> Once Nelly returned to the studio to record the track, his vision changed, wanting to add a female vocal onto it. He instantly thought of [[Destiny's Child]] member [[Kelly Rowland]], whom he had met during the ''[[Total Request Live|TRL]]'' tour in 2001. Nelly called Rowland by phone and agreed. After a few days of recording, during which Rowland re-recorded her part many times to achieve it \"just right\", \"Dilemma\" was completed.<ref name=\"MossMaking\"/>\n\nOnce ''Nellyville'' was released in the United States on June 25, 2002, radio programmers started playing \"Dilemma\". By July 2002, the track had reached the top ten of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] based on airplay alone.

Rowland and LaBelle portray a mother-daughter pair who move in across the street from resident Nelly.

However, Rowland's character has a boyfriend and a child, both complicating their interest in each other.\n\n===Reception===\nIn a retrospective review, Ashley Perkins of ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'' mentions how \"the 4XL tee and headband-sported video adds just the right amount of dramatization to allow a glimpse into how much of a dilemma Nelly and Kelly\u2019s situationship was.\" She further explained that the narrative was explained \"in a light other than from the perspective of the frustrated and faithful counterpart or the creeping side piece\", which would later be replicated in songs such as \"Situationships\" by [[Fabolous]], and \"[[Distraction (Kehlani song)|Distraction]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vibe.com/2017/06/nellyville-album-anniversary-nelly|title='Nellyville': 15 Ways Nelly's Midwest-Spun Recipe Made The Culture Pop|last=Pickens|first=Ashley|website=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|date=June 26, 2017|access-date=October 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Remixes and sequel==\n{{Main|Gone (Nelly song)}}\nThe official remix was produced by [[Jermaine Dupri]] and features [[Kelly Rowland]] and [[Ali (American rapper)|Ali]] of the [[St. Lunatics]].

It was released on July 30, 2002 as the third [[Single (music)|single]] from Nelly's second [[studio album]] ''[[Nellyville]]'' (2002), and the [[lead single]] from Rowland's debut solo studio album ''[[Simply Deep]]'' (2002), becoming one of the [[List of best-selling singles|best selling singles]] of all time.\n\nDuring the 55th anniversary of the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] issue of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', the song was ranked at number seventy-five on the all-time Hot 100 songs<ref name=\"Bronson 2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/2155531/the-hot-100-all-time-top-songs?list_page=2|title=Hot 100 55th Anniversary: The All-Time Top 100 Songs|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=August 2, 2012|accessdate=August 9, 2013|first=Fred|last=Bronson}}</ref> while at the end of 2009 was named the eleventh most successful song from 2000 to 2009, on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 Songs of the Decade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/chart_display.jsp?g=Singles&f=Greece#/charts-decade-end/hot-100-songs?year=2009&begin=11&order=position|title=Overall Popularity Top Charts|website=Billboard|access-date=April 2, 2014}}</ref> The song won a [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Performance]] at the [[45th Annual Grammy Awards]] on February 23, 2003.\n\n==Background and release==\nIn 2002, producer [[Ryan Bowser]] created an instrumental which sampled and contained elements from [[Patti LaBelle]]'s \"[[Love, Need and Want You]]\" (1983). Upon hearing the beat, given to him by St. Louis producer Antoine \"Bam\" Macon, Nelly began writing lyrics and then wrote a song out from it. He then decided to make the song a last-minute addition to his second album ''[[Nellyville]]'', which had already been completed prior to Bam giving him the track.<ref name=\"MossMaking\">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1470044/20030220/nelly.jhtml|title=Road To The Grammys: The Making Of Nelly's 'Dilemma'|last=Moss|first=Corey|date=2003-02-20|publisher=MTV|accessdate=2009-02-23}}</ref> Once Nelly returned to the studio to record the track, his vision changed, wanting to add a female vocal onto it. He instantly thought of [[Destiny's Child]] member [[Kelly Rowland]], whom he had met during the ''[[Total Request Live|TRL]]'' tour in 2001. Nelly called Rowland by phone and agreed. After a few days of recording, during which Rowland re-recorded her part many times to achieve it \"just right\", \"Dilemma\" was completed.<ref name=\"MossMaking\"/>\n\nOnce ''Nellyville'' was released in the United States on June 25, 2002, radio programmers started playing \"Dilemma\". By July 2002, the track had reached the top ten of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] based on airplay alone. This prompted Nelly to release it as the album's second single, although it was not the original plan.<ref name=\"MossHitDC\">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1456206/20020722/destinys_child.jhtml|title=Nelly Hit Forces Change In Plans For Destiny's Child LPs|last=Moss|first=Corey|date=2002-07-22|publisher=MTV|accessdate=2009-02-23}}</ref> The single was released on July 30, 2002. The decision affected the early plans for Destiny's Child members, as they were held on hiatus to pursue solo album releases. As part of their strategy, each of their albums were to be staggered, with member [[Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles]] releasing in October 2002 and Rowland's album expected in early 2003.<ref name=\"MossHitDC\"/> Their management rescheduled the dates: Rowland eventually released her debut solo album, ''[[Simply Deep]]'', on October 28, 2002, ahead of Knowles, which caused her to move and push back her album release to a June 2003 date. \"Dilemma\" was released as the first single from the album, which served as a propeller for her solo career.<ref name=\"MossMaking\"/> \"Dilemma\" is Rowland's first international solo single away from the group: she had previously appeared on R&B singer [[Avant (singer)|Avant]]'s single \"[[Separated (song)|Separated]]\", which was released in the United States in July 2000.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Critical reception==\n\"Dilemma\" was generally well received by critics. [[AllMusic]] reviewer Jason Birchmeier noted it as one of \"three well-calculated, standout\" tracks in the album.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r593317|pure_url=yes}}|title=Nellyville: Nelly|last=Birchmeier|first=Jason|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=2009-02-23}}</ref> In her review for ''Simply Deep'', Caroline Sullivan of ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote: \"Thanks to the ubiquitous Dilemma, a song that practically peeled off its clothes on the spot.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/feb/07/popandrock.artsfeatures1|title=Kelly Rowland: Simply Deep|last=Sullivan|first=Caroline|date=2003-02-07|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2009-02-23}}</ref>\n\n\"Dilemma\" was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Performance|Best Rap/Sung Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] at the [[45th Annual Grammy Awards]] on 23 February 2003, winning the former.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Commercial performance==\n\"Dilemma\" is the most successful song of Nelly's career, giving him his first number-one single in many countries, such as the United Kingdom, Australia, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. It is also the most successful single of Rowland's career, alongside the worldwide dance hit \"[[When Love Takes Over]]\". It is not only Rowland's most successful solo single in the United States, but also in the United Kingdom, with 800,000 copies sold as of November 2011.<ref name=\"MTVMusic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/x-factor/kelly-rowland%E2%80%99s-official-top-10-coming-to-mtv |title=Kelly Rowland\u2019s Official Top 10 coming to MTV |publisher=Unreality TV |date=2011-12-02 |accessdate=2014-04-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210200935/http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/x-factor/kelly-rowland%E2%80%99s-official-top-10-coming-to-mtv/ |archivedate=2011-12-10 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/our-partners/ |title=About Us - Our Partners |publisher=Theofficialcharts.com |accessdate=2014-04-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207065842/http://www.theofficialcharts.com/our-partners/ |archivedate=2012-02-07 }}</ref>\n\nThe single became a hit in the summer and fall of 2002 in the United States. While \"[[Hot in Herre]]\" was peaking on the charts, radio stations already started to play \"Dilemma\" in July 2002. It quickly climbed up the US [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] and replaced \"Hot in Herre\" at number one after seven weeks on the Hot 100, giving Nelly his second consecutive number one from ''Nellyville''. The song had already reached number one on the Hot 100 before a video was ever shot as Nelly's record label did not expect the song to explode so fast and expected they could take their time with the video. The song made its debut on the ''Billboard'' charts the week of July 6, 2002, it opened at numbers 66 and 63 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] and [[R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay]] charts, respectively.<ref>{{cite book|title=Billboard - July 6, 2002|url=https://books.google.com.bo/books?id=9QsEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |work=[[Billboard Magazine]]|publisher=[[Google Books]]|accessdate=September 19, 2017|pages=22;23}}</ref> The next week, on July 13, 2002, it debuted at number 51 on the [[Radio Songs]] chart, it also opened at number 53 on the [[Hot 100]] the same week.<ref>{{cite book|title=Billboard - July 13, 2002|url= https://books.google.com.bo/books?id=-gsEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=es&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |work=[[Billboard Magazine]]|publisher=[[Google Books]]|accessdate=September 14, 2017|pages=92;93}}</ref> After four weeks, on August 17, 2002, it reached number one on the Hot 100, staying there for ten weeks and remaining on the chart for 29 weeks.<ref>{{Cite news|last=''Billboard'' Staff|first=|date=July 1, 2016|url =http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6835190/hot-100-songs-10-weeks-or-more-at-no-1 |title=Every Song to stay at No. 1 on Hot 100 for 10 or More Weeks|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-08-09}}</ref><ref name=\"BB100\"/> With this song Nelly replaced himself from the top of the chart, his last single, [[Hot In Herre]], dropped to number two while Dilemma moved from number two to number one.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Lynch|first=Joe|date=September 24, 2015|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6707886/weeknd-artists-replaced-themselves-hot-100-chart |title=The 11 Artists Who've Replaced Themselves at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100|work=Billboard|quote=Two more rap acts achieved this feat in the '00s: Nelly's Kelly Rowland-assisted \"Dilemma\" took the spot of 2002 song of the summer \"Hot in Herre\"|access-date=2017-09-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/2002-08-17|title=Music: Top 100 Songs|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=August 17, 2002|accessdate=2017-09-19}}</ref> The song also topped the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]], [[Mainstream Top 40]], [[Radio Songs]] and [[R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay]] charts.<ref name=\"BBrandb\"/><ref name=\"BBpop\"/><ref>{{cite magazine | url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=Nelly|chart=Radio Songs}} | title=Nelly \u2013 Chart history |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | accessdate=September 14, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine | url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=Nelly|chart=R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay}} | title=Nelly \u2013 Chart history |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | accessdate=September 19, 2017}}</ref> While \"Dilemma\" exploded at [[urban contemporary]], [[rhythmic contemporary]] and [[contemporary hit radio]], it managed to crossover to [[urban adult contemporary]] radio stations such as KJLH Los Angeles which added \"Dilemma\" in rotation on the week of July 8, 2002, following a positive response from younger listeners.\n\nIn the [[UK Singles Chart|United Kingdom]] the single debuted at number one on October 26, 2002, and stayed at the top of the chart for two weeks, it remained on the chart for twenty four weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/20021020/7501/|title=Official Singles Chart Top 100|last=|first=|date=October 26, 2002|website=|publisher=[[UK Singles Chart]].

Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]] and [[John Boorman]]. These attempts resulted in a couple of unproduced scripts, concept art and an animated short. Other filmmakers and producers to have had an interest in adapting Tolkien are said to include [[Walt Disney]], [[Al Brodax]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who considered [[Richard Lester]] to direct, but instead approached [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]) and [[George Lucas]]. The rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]]. In 1976, UA passed the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'' (and a part of the rights to ''The Hobbit'') to [[Fantasy Films|Fantasy films]].\n\nIn 1977, an animated adaptation of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]'' was produced as a TV special by [[Rankin/Bass Productions|Rankin and Bass]] (followed in 1980 by a TV animated adaptation of ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]''), and in 1978 [[Ralph Bakshi]] made an animated feature of the first half of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''. While profitable, the film didn't make enough money to automatically warrant the sequel which would close the story, and an argument with producer [[Saul Zaentz]] led Bakshi to abandon the project. Several Tolkien-esque fantasy films were produced at the time, as well, including Boorman's ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'' and George Lucas' production of ''[[Willow (film)|Willow]]''.\n\nAt the time that Bakshi's film aired, a teenager Peter Jackson hadn't read the book, but \"heard the name\",<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009173240/http://www.conlanpress.com/resources/peter_jackson_on_Tolkien_inspiration_2-6-04.mp3 |title=Peter Jackson, as quoted at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood, on February 6, 2004. |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref> and went to see the film: \"I liked the early part \u2013 it had some quaint sequences in Hobbiton, a creepy encounter with the Black Rider on the road, and a few quite good battle scenes \u2013 but then, about half way through, the storytelling became very disjointed and disorientating and I really didn't understand what was going on. However, what it did do was to make me want to read the book \u2013 if only to find out what happened!\"<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sibley |first=Brian |title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=6}}</ref> Jackson bought a tie-in paperback edition.

Assuming someone will one day adapt it to a live-action film, Jackson read on some previous attempts to bring the piece to the screen.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XDsSr3sGSI&t=2369s |title=Peter Jackson Exeter interview, 2015 |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref> He hadn't watched the Rankin and Bass TV Specials.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.herr-der-ringe-film.de/v3/de/news/tolkienfilme/news_19958.php|title=20 QUESTIONS WITH PETER JACKSON - PART 2|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref name=\":31\">\"Peter Jackson interview\". ''Explorations''. Barnes & Noble Science Fiction newsletter. October\u2013November 2001.</ref>\n\n=== Pitch to Miramax ===\nIn 1995, while completing post-production on ''[[The Frighteners]]'', Jackson and Fran Walsh discussed making an original fantasy film, but couldn't think of a scenario that wasn't Tolkien-esque, and eventually decided to look up the film rights. They went to [[Harvey Weinstein]] from [[Miramax]], who got the rights from Saul Zaentz. Jackson knew it would take multiple films to do Tolkien justice,<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=|title=A Filmmaker's Journey|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=36-40}}</ref> but initially pitched a single trilogy: one film based on ''The Hobbit'' and, if that would prove successful, two ''Lord of the Rings'' films shot back-to-back.<ref name=\":5\" /> Jackson began rereading The Hobbit, looking at illustrations and commissioning concept art from the book, but the rights eventually proved unattainable, having been split between Zaentz and United Artists. Harvey tried to the buy the studio's share of the rights, but was unsuccessful.\n\nWith the Hobbit postponed for a later prequel, Jackson proceeded with making two or more<ref name=\":6\" /> ''Lord of the Rings'' films: \"We pitched the idea of three films and Miramax didn't really want to take that risk, but we agreed on two.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ggVDYcvNxg |title=Peter Jackson interview with Charlie Rose, 2002 |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228201928/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ggVDYcvNxg|archive-date=28 February 2020|access-date=}}</ref> He began writing the scripts with Walsh and [[Stephen Sinclair]], storyboard with [[Christian Rivers]] and discussing casting ideas with the Weinsteins. Meanwhile [[Weta Digital|WETA Digital]] began software development for the digital effects required,<ref name=\":0\" /> and  [[Weta Workshop|WETA Workshop]] were producing props and concept art. Sinclair later dropped from the project, but Jackson felt that some of his contributions survived into the finished scripts, particularly the middle film, ''The Two Towers'', for which he is credited.\n\n=== Move to New Line ===\nHowever, as the scripts took shape, it became clear that the budget required would exceed Miramax' capabilities. The Weinsteins suggested cutting the project to one film.<ref name=\":0\" /> Jackson inquired whether it could be around four-hours in duration, but Miramax insisted on two hours, suggesting major cuts to the story, which Jackson refused. Harvey Weinstein threatened to replace Jackson with screenwriter [[Hossein Amini]] and directors [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]]. Jackson believes this was an empty threat to get him to concede to making a one-film version himself. <ref name=\":7\" />\n\nHarvey eventually relented to putting the project on a turnaround, but the onerous conditions were meant to prevent the project from being taken up by another studio.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book |last= |first= |title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=39\u201340}}</ref> Jackson got an audience with New Line CEO [[Robert Shaye]], who accepted the project, but requested that it be expanded into a trilogy. Final Cut rights were shared contractually between Jackson and Bob Shaye, but there was never any interference in Jackson's cut.\n\n== Production ==\n{{Main|Production of The Lord of the Rings film series}}\n[[File:Alan Lee 2005.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]], a Tolkien illustrator who assisted in the visual design, at [[63rd World Science Fiction Convention|Worldcon 2005]] in [[Glasgow]].]]\nJackson began [[storyboard]]ing and [[screenwriting]] the series with [[Christian Rivers]], [[Fran Walsh]] and [[Philippa Boyens]] in 1997 and assigned his crew to begin designing Middle-earth at the same time.<ref name=\"TTT Art\">{{Cite book |last=Russell |first=Gary |authorlink=Gary Russell |title=The Art of the Two Towers |publisher=Harper Collins |year=2003 |isbn=0-00-713564-5}}</ref> Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens did not write each film to correspond exactly to its respective book, opting instead to write a three-part [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] with some sequences missing, some sequences created from scratch, and some sequences moved from one area to another regardless of its placement in the books. To allow the story to be clearer for viewers, Jackson takes a more [[chronology|chronological]] approach to the story than did Tolkien.

He was also finally given a chance to remake ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' in 2005.

The films, which were released between 2012 and 2014, used much of the cast of ''The Lord of the Rings'', including [[Ian McKellen]], [[Andy Serkis]], [[Hugo Weaving]], [[Elijah Wood]], [[Ian Holm]], [[Christopher Lee]], [[Cate Blanchett]] and [[Orlando Bloom]] who reprised their roles. Most of the crew returned, as well, with Jackson directing, him and Walsh producing and Boyens co-writing. Ngila Dickson, Grant Major, Jim Rygiel and Ethan Van der Ryn dropped out from costume design, production design, animation and sound editing respectivelly, but were succeeded by their Lord of the Rings colleagues, Richard Taylor, Dan Hennah, Joe Letteri and Brent Burge. The only complete changes in the staff involved the change of gaffer, after [[Brian Bansgrove]] died between the trilogies, and stunt coordinator Glen Boswall replaced [[George Marshall Ruge]] who worked on ''Rings''. \n\nAlthough the ''Hobbit'' trilogy was commercially successful, it received mixed reviews from critics. However, the films did manage to add another seven Academy Award nominations to the series' tally, to an overall 37, and another win for the [[Scientific and Engineering Award]], resulting in the most nominations and wins for a six-part series.\n\n=== Amazon's ''The Lord of the Rings'' prequel series ===\n[[Amazon Studios]] discussed development of a series based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' with [[Warner Bros.

Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]] and [[John Boorman]]. These attempts resulted in a couple of unproduced scripts, concept art and an animated short. Other filmmakers and producers to have had an interest in adapting Tolkien are said to include [[Walt Disney]], [[Al Brodax]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who considered [[Richard Lester]] to direct, but instead approached [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]) and [[George Lucas]]. The rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]]. In 1976, UA passed the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'' (and a part of the rights to ''The Hobbit'') to [[Fantasy Films|Fantasy films]].\n\nIn 1977, an animated adaptation of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]'' was produced as a TV special by [[Rankin/Bass Productions|Rankin and Bass]] (followed in 1980 by a TV animated adaptation of ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]''), and in 1978 [[Ralph Bakshi]] made an animated feature of the first half of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''. While profitable, the film didn't make enough money to automatically warrant the sequel which would close the story, and an argument with producer [[Saul Zaentz]] led Bakshi to abandon the project. Several Tolkien-esque fantasy films were produced at the time, as well, including Boorman's ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'' and George Lucas' production of ''[[Willow (film)|Willow]]''.\n\nAt the time that Bakshi's film aired, a teenager Peter Jackson hadn't read the book, but \"heard the name\",<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009173240/http://www.conlanpress.com/resources/peter_jackson_on_Tolkien_inspiration_2-6-04.mp3 |title=Peter Jackson, as quoted at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood, on February 6, 2004. |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref> and went to see the film: \"I liked the early part \u2013 it had some quaint sequences in Hobbiton, a creepy encounter with the Black Rider on the road, and a few quite good battle scenes \u2013 but then, about half way through, the storytelling became very disjointed and disorientating and I really didn't understand what was going on.

They went to [[Harvey Weinstein]] from [[Miramax]], who got the rights from Saul Zaentz. Jackson knew it would take multiple films to do Tolkien justice,<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=|title=A Filmmaker's Journey|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=36-40}}</ref> but initially pitched a single trilogy: one film based on ''The Hobbit'' and, if that would prove successful, two ''Lord of the Rings'' films shot back-to-back.<ref name=\":5\" /> Jackson began rereading The Hobbit, looking at illustrations and commissioning concept art from the book, but the rights eventually proved unattainable, having been split between Zaentz and United Artists. Harvey tried to the buy the studio's share of the rights, but was unsuccessful.\n\nWith the Hobbit postponed for a later prequel, Jackson proceeded with making two or more<ref name=\":6\" /> ''Lord of the Rings'' films: \"We pitched the idea of three films and Miramax didn't really want to take that risk, but we agreed on two.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ggVDYcvNxg |title=Peter Jackson interview with Charlie Rose, 2002 |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228201928/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ggVDYcvNxg|archive-date=28 February 2020|access-date=}}</ref> He began writing the scripts with Walsh and [[Stephen Sinclair]], storyboard with [[Christian Rivers]] and discussing casting ideas with the Weinsteins. Meanwhile [[Weta Digital|WETA Digital]] began software development for the digital effects required,<ref name=\":0\" /> and  [[Weta Workshop|WETA Workshop]] were producing props and concept art. Sinclair later dropped from the project, but Jackson felt that some of his contributions survived into the finished scripts, particularly the middle film, ''The Two Towers'', for which he is credited.\n\n=== Move to New Line ===\nHowever, as the scripts took shape, it became clear that the budget required would exceed Miramax' capabilities. The Weinsteins suggested cutting the project to one film.<ref name=\":0\" /> Jackson inquired whether it could be around four-hours in duration, but Miramax insisted on two hours, suggesting major cuts to the story, which Jackson refused. Harvey Weinstein threatened to replace Jackson with screenwriter [[Hossein Amini]] and directors [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]]. Jackson believes this was an empty threat to get him to concede to making a one-film version himself. <ref name=\":7\" />\n\nHarvey eventually relented to putting the project on a turnaround, but the onerous conditions were meant to prevent the project from being taken up by another studio.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book |last= |first= |title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=39\u201340}}</ref> Jackson got an audience with New Line CEO [[Robert Shaye]], who accepted the project, but requested that it be expanded into a trilogy. Final Cut rights were shared contractually between Jackson and Bob Shaye, but there was never any interference in Jackson's cut.\n\n== Production ==\n{{Main|Production of The Lord of the Rings film series}}\n[[File:Alan Lee 2005.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]], a Tolkien illustrator who assisted in the visual design, at [[63rd World Science Fiction Convention|Worldcon 2005]] in [[Glasgow]].]]\nJackson began [[storyboard]]ing and [[screenwriting]] the series with [[Christian Rivers]], [[Fran Walsh]] and [[Philippa Boyens]] in 1997 and assigned his crew to begin designing Middle-earth at the same time.<ref name=\"TTT Art\">{{Cite book |last=Russell |first=Gary |authorlink=Gary Russell |title=The Art of the Two Towers |publisher=Harper Collins |year=2003 |isbn=0-00-713564-5}}</ref> Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens did not write each film to correspond exactly to its respective book, opting instead to write a three-part [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] with some sequences missing, some sequences created from scratch, and some sequences moved from one area to another regardless of its placement in the books.

They include: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (video game)|The Two Towers]],'' [[The Lord of the Rings (pinball)|Pinball]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)|The Return of the King]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age|The Third Age]]'', [[The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age (Game Boy Advance)|''The Third Age'' (GBA)]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Tactics|Tactics]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth|The Battle for Middle-earth]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II|The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king|The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest|Conquest]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest|Aragorn's Quest]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North|War in the North]]'', ''[[Lego The Lord of the Rings (video game)|Lego The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[Guardians of Middle-earth]]'', ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]]'', and ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of War]]''.\n\n=== ''The Hobbit'' prequel trilogy ===\n{{Main|The Hobbit (film series)}}\nThe success of ''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy led to Jackson directing a trilogy of prequels based on Tolkien's children's book ''[[The Hobbit]]''. The films, which were released between 2012 and 2014, used much of the cast of ''The Lord of the Rings'', including [[Ian McKellen]], [[Andy Serkis]], [[Hugo Weaving]], [[Elijah Wood]], [[Ian Holm]], [[Christopher Lee]], [[Cate Blanchett]] and [[Orlando Bloom]] who reprised their roles. Most of the crew returned, as well, with Jackson directing, him and Walsh producing and Boyens co-writing. Ngila Dickson, Grant Major, Jim Rygiel and Ethan Van der Ryn dropped out from costume design, production design, animation and sound editing respectivelly, but were succeeded by their Lord of the Rings colleagues, Richard Taylor, Dan Hennah, Joe Letteri and Brent Burge. The only complete changes in the staff involved the change of gaffer, after [[Brian Bansgrove]] died between the trilogies, and stunt coordinator Glen Boswall replaced [[George Marshall Ruge]] who worked on ''Rings''. \n\nAlthough the ''Hobbit'' trilogy was commercially successful, it received mixed reviews from critics. However, the films did manage to add another seven Academy Award nominations to the series' tally, to an overall 37, and another win for the [[Scientific and Engineering Award]], resulting in the most nominations and wins for a six-part series.\n\n=== Amazon's ''The Lord of the Rings'' prequel series ===\n[[Amazon Studios]] discussed development of a series based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' with [[Warner Bros.

For most of his career he was a member of the [[New York Knickerbockers]]. He first played for the New York Base Ball Club in 1840 and started his Knickerbockers career five years later, continuing to play for the club into his forties and to take part in inter-squad practice games and matches against opposing teams. Researchers have called Adams the creator of the [[shortstop]] position, which he used to field short throws from [[outfielder]]s. In addition to his playing career, Adams manufactured baseballs and oversaw [[Baseball bat|bat]] production; he also occasionally acted as an [[Umpire (baseball)|umpire]].\n\nFrom 1847 to 1861, the Knickerbockers selected Adams as their president six times, and as a vice president, treasurer, or director in six other years. As president of the club, Adams was an advocate of rule changes in baseball that resulted in nine-man teams and nine-[[inning]] games. When the [[National Association of Base Ball Players]] (NABBP) was formed in 1858, he led the rules and regulations committee of the new organization. In his role, Adams ruled that the fields' [[Baseball field#Specifications|bases]] should be {{convert|90|ft|m|sp=us}} apart, the modern distance, and supported the elimination of the \"bound rule\", which allowed for balls caught after one bounce to be recorded as [[Out (baseball)|outs]]. He resigned from his positions with the Knickerbockers and NABBP in 1862. Adams' contributions in creating baseball's rules went largely unrecognized for decades after his 1899 death, but in 1980 a letter about him appeared in ''[[The New York Times]]''; by 1993, researcher [[John Thorn]] had written about Adams' role.

He accepted and joined the club along with other men in the medical field; he later said that players from the New York Base Ball Club were behind the formation of the Knickerbockers.{{sfn|Thorn|2011|pp=30\u201331, 36}} Records of the club's practice games indicate that he was a member of the Knickerbockers by November 18, 1845. In an inter-squad game held that day, which was the Knickerbockers' last of the year, Adams scored nine [[Run (baseball)|runs]] for his team as they defeated a side picked by [[William Wheaton|William R. Wheaton]], 51\u201342.{{sfn|Freyer & Rucker|2005|p=11}} The club organized its first game against outside opposition in 1846; at a June 5 meeting Adams was selected to a three-man committee whose aim was to set up a game against the New York Base Ball Club. The committee's efforts were successful, and a game was scheduled on June 19.{{sfn|Freyer & Rucker|2005|pp=12\u201313}} Adams participated in the contest, which the Knickerbockers lost 23\u20131. Batting second in the Knickerbockers' [[Batting order (baseball)|lineup]], he made one [[Out (baseball)|out]] and did not score a run.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|p=45}}\n\nThe Knickerbockers did not play any known games against other clubs from 1847 to 1850. During these years, the team split its players into two squads, which played against each other twice per week.{{sfn|Husman|2000|p=5}} According to Adams, he often attempted to compel members of the Knickerbockers to attend the sessions. He was only occasionally successful, and when few Knickerbockers came, they played variants of baseball that required fewer players than regular games.{{sfn|Morris|2008|pp=30\u201331}} Twice in June 1851, the club played against the Washington Base Ball Club, winning by scores of 21\u201311 and 22\u201320. No individual statistics are available for the first game;{{sfn|Freyer & Rucker|2005|p=14}} Adams scored twice for the Knickerbockers in the second. In 1853, Adams played in two games against the Gotham Ball Club, tallying seven runs in a pair of victories.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|pp=226\u2013227}} The two clubs met three times from June to October 1854, and Adams had one run in each game.

Adams competed four times for the club against outside opponents in 1856 as it won once, lost twice, and had one tie; he scored ten times, and records for two games showed that his defensive position was [[shortstop]]. The Knickerbockers had a 2\u20132 win\u2013loss record in competitive games during 1857 that Adams participated in. Playing three times at shortstop and once at [[first base]] defensively, he contributed 12 runs offensively, including a six-run effort in the Knickerbockers' 37\u201323 victory over the Empire club on June 24. In 1858, Adams made four appearances for the Knickerbockers against outside opposition and scored nine runs, but the team went 1\u20133 in the games.

The only infielders were the players covering each of the bases; if there were more than eight players, extra [[outfielder]]s were sometimes used. The outfielders had difficulty throwing baseballs into the infield, because of the balls' light weight.

The shortstop filled one of the two gaps.{{sfn|Schiff|2008|p=48}}\n\nAdams hit left-handed; he said that his batted balls occasionally went into a river by the [[Elysian Fields, Hoboken, New Jersey|Elysian Fields]], the ground in [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], New Jersey, where the Knickerbockers practiced and played.{{sfn|Ward & Burns|1994|pp=4\u20135}} Adams had a long on-field career with the Knickerbockers; he remained a player with the team until 1859.{{sfn|Thorn|2011|p=106}} He did not limit his play to shortstop; he fielded at every position except [[pitcher]].{{sfn|Husman|2000|p=5}} Little is known about the relative performance of early baseball players, and the game was largely recreational, as opposed to competitive. Thorn speculates that Adams may have been \"the best player of the 1840s\", citing his lengthy playing career as evidence.{{sfn|Thorn|2011|pp=105\u2013106}}\n\n==Equipment maker and umpire==\nIn addition to playing the game, Adams was involved in the production of early baseball equipment. He personally manufactured [[Baseball (ball)|baseballs]] for a period of time, supplying many New York City-based clubs. Adams found that when the ball was more tightly stitched, it traveled further when batted or thrown.{{sfn|Thorn|1993|p=6}}{{sfn|Schaefer|2009|pp=88\u201389}} According to author [[Peter Morris (writer)|Peter Morris]], Adams' ball-manufacturing efforts helped to keep the Knickerbockers in operation during their first few years, as they would otherwise have had difficulty finding balls.{{sfn|Morris|2008|pp=10, 31}} In later years Adams gathered rubber from old [[galoshes]] for the insides of baseballs. A [[Tanning (leather)|tanner]] then used [[Glossary of baseball (H)#horsehide|horsehide]] to create the balls.<ref name=\"founder\"/> As late as 1863, Adams was one of the three most prominent makers of baseballs in New York, continuing to produce them by hand.{{sfn|Hample|2011|p=94}} Adams also played a role in producing [[baseball bats]], choosing which wood to use and overseeing the manufacturing process.<ref name=\"founder\"/>\n\nAdams also worked occasionally as an [[Umpire (baseball)|umpire]] in significant games.{{sfn|Husman|2000|p=5}} One notable example was the final contest of a three-game series between all-star teams from Brooklyn and New York City, held on September 10, 1858, in Long Island. During the game, which the New York City all-stars won 29\u201318, Adams became the first umpire to use a new rule allowing for a [[Strike zone|strike]] to be called against a batter who did not swing at a pitch in the strike zone. Previously, strikes were only called when a batter swung at a pitch and missed. Three batters were ruled out on strikes called by Adams in the game.{{sfn|Thorn|2011|pp=75, 116, 119}}{{sfn|Morris|2008|p=71}} Otherwise, the called strike rule was not applied often in its first few years of existence.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|p=181}}\n\n==Knickerbockers and NABBP executive==\n[[File:Knickerbocker baseball team.jpg|thumb|left|Adams standing in the middle of a group of New York Knickerbockers in 1859|alt=Seven members of the New York Knickerbockers baseball team standing on a field.

At the club's second election, held on May 5, 1846, Adams was named the Knickerbockers' vice president.

Adams was one of the three Knickerbockers members selected to be on the committee, and the clubs agreed on a set of rules, which were presented at the Knickerbockers' meeting on April 1, 1854. At the same meeting, Adams was voted into the position of club director.{{sfn|Freyer & Rucker|2005|p=15}}\n\nAfter again being named a director in 1855, Adams became president of the Knickerbockers for the fourth time, winning an election held at the club's April 5, 1856, meeting.

No rules existed at the time regarding team size, but official games between clubs were typically played with nine men per club. The proposal was defeated by a 13\u201311 vote, in favor of a rule forbidding non-club members to play if there were 14 players (seven per team).{{sfn|Thorn|2011|pp=51\u201352}}\n\nA two-man committee was created with the aim of working with the Eagle and Washington clubs to resolve the debate over how many players to field in official games.

His partner on the committee, Curry, had led the opposition to nine-man teams. Adams and Curry also differed on another issue: the length of games.{{sfn|Thorn|2011|pp=51\u201352}} At the time, a baseball game lasted until one of the teams had 21 runs; that team was awarded the victory.<ref name=\"founder\"/> A change in how games were won was deemed necessary after the suspended game in 1854.

These included a clarification of the prescribed distance between [[Base (baseball)|bases]], which under [[Knickerbocker Rules]] had been set at \"forty-two paces\" between home plate and second base, and \"forty-two paces, equidistant\" between first and third base.{{sfn|Thorn|1993|pp=6\u20137}} Historians differ on whether the bases were roughly {{convert|90|ft|m|sp=us}} apart, or a shorter distance.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|p=34}} Thorn has written that the pace itself may have been \"an imprecise and variable measure, to gauge distances by 'stepping off',\" and Adams described the rule as \"rather vague.\"{{sfn|Thorn|1993|pp=6\u20137}} At the 1857 convention, it was decided that bases would be \"securely fastened upon the four corners of a square whose sides are roughly thirty yards.\"{{sfn|Hershberger|2013|p=33}} As rules committee chairman for the new NABBP, Adams made the baselines {{convert|90|ft|m|sp=us}} from one base to another, the distance seen in modern baseball. He ruled on the distance between home plate and the pitcher's mound as well, making them {{convert|45|ft|m|sp=us}} apart.{{sfn|Thorn|2011|pp=28, 35\u201336}} In addition, the committee mandated that clubs have nine players per side, which became the norm.<ref name=\"invent\"/>{{sfn|Thorn|2011|p=51}} It also created the called strike rule, in an effort to reduce pitch totals and the time required to play games.{{sfn|Morris, Ryczek, Finkel, Levin & Malatzky|2013|p=3}}\n\nAdams campaigned for a further change in the rules of baseball, involving when outs were recorded. At the time, an out was allowed when the ball was caught by a fielder after one bounce; this was known as the \"bound rule\".{{sfn|Morris|2008|p=67}} Adams supported a ban on such outs, calling his preferred rule \"the fly-game\".{{sfn|Thorn|1993|p=7}} Under the style of play he backed, when a [[Batted ball|fly ball]] was hit a fielder would have to catch the ball before it touched the ground for an out to be made. This was similar to rules on catches in [[cricket]], and would serve to increase the level of skill required from fielders.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|pp=174\u2013175}} The Knickerbockers had enacted a rule mandating the \"fly-catch\" by 1857.{{sfn|Schiff|2008|p=54}}\n\nThe Knickerbockers attempted to introduce the fly rule more widely at the 1857 convention, with a proposal that permitted the continued use of the bound rule for [[foul ball]]s. Despite widespread support from sportswriters, the proposed rule change was voted down. Writer William Hershberger said that the decision showed \"the limits of the Knickerbockers' influence and divisions within the baseball fraternity.\"{{sfn|Hershberger|2013|pp=41\u201342}} The rule change was proposed to the NABBP annually by Adams but did not pass. At the 1858 NABBP convention, a vote on eliminating the bound rule was unsuccessful.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|p=175}} Opponents raised concerns that the proposal would dramatically lengthen game times.{{sfn|Schiff|2008|p=54}} Despite his support for the fly rule, in 1858 Adams successfully motioned for NABBP regulations, including outs on bounces, to apply to the Knickerbockers. He did so because he was reluctant to oppose the rules of the NABBP.

For most of his career he was a member of the [[New York Knickerbockers]]. He first played for the New York Base Ball Club in 1840 and started his Knickerbockers career five years later, continuing to play for the club into his forties and to take part in inter-squad practice games and matches against opposing teams. Researchers have called Adams the creator of the [[shortstop]] position, which he used to field short throws from [[outfielder]]s. In addition to his playing career, Adams manufactured baseballs and oversaw [[Baseball bat|bat]] production; he also occasionally acted as an [[Umpire (baseball)|umpire]].\n\nFrom 1847 to 1861, the Knickerbockers selected Adams as their president six times, and as a vice president, treasurer, or director in six other years. As president of the club, Adams was an advocate of rule changes in baseball that resulted in nine-man teams and nine-[[inning]] games. When the [[National Association of Base Ball Players]] (NABBP) was formed in 1858, he led the rules and regulations committee of the new organization. In his role, Adams ruled that the fields' [[Baseball field#Specifications|bases]] should be {{convert|90|ft|m|sp=us}} apart, the modern distance, and supported the elimination of the \"bound rule\", which allowed for balls caught after one bounce to be recorded as [[Out (baseball)|outs]]. He resigned from his positions with the Knickerbockers and NABBP in 1862. Adams' contributions in creating baseball's rules went largely unrecognized for decades after his 1899 death, but in 1980 a letter about him appeared in ''[[The New York Times]]''; by 1993, researcher [[John Thorn]] had written about Adams' role. Other historians have given him credit for helping to develop the sport, and Thorn has called Adams \"first among the Fathers of Baseball\".{{sfn|Thorn|1993|p=7}}\n\nA graduate of [[Yale University]] and [[Harvard Medical School]], Adams began working in the medical field in the late 1830s, and practiced in New York City during his time as a member of the Knickerbockers. In 1865, he left medicine and later became a bank president and member of the [[Connecticut House of Representatives|Connecticut legislature]].

He accepted and joined the club along with other men in the medical field; he later said that players from the New York Base Ball Club were behind the formation of the Knickerbockers.{{sfn|Thorn|2011|pp=30\u201331, 36}} Records of the club's practice games indicate that he was a member of the Knickerbockers by November 18, 1845. In an inter-squad game held that day, which was the Knickerbockers' last of the year, Adams scored nine [[Run (baseball)|runs]] for his team as they defeated a side picked by [[William Wheaton|William R. Wheaton]], 51\u201342.{{sfn|Freyer & Rucker|2005|p=11}} The club organized its first game against outside opposition in 1846; at a June 5 meeting Adams was selected to a three-man committee whose aim was to set up a game against the New York Base Ball Club. The committee's efforts were successful, and a game was scheduled on June 19.{{sfn|Freyer & Rucker|2005|pp=12\u201313}} Adams participated in the contest, which the Knickerbockers lost 23\u20131. Batting second in the Knickerbockers' [[Batting order (baseball)|lineup]], he made one [[Out (baseball)|out]] and did not score a run.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|p=45}}\n\nThe Knickerbockers did not play any known games against other clubs from 1847 to 1850. During these years, the team split its players into two squads, which played against each other twice per week.{{sfn|Husman|2000|p=5}} According to Adams, he often attempted to compel members of the Knickerbockers to attend the sessions. He was only occasionally successful, and when few Knickerbockers came, they played variants of baseball that required fewer players than regular games.{{sfn|Morris|2008|pp=30\u201331}} Twice in June 1851, the club played against the Washington Base Ball Club, winning by scores of 21\u201311 and 22\u201320. No individual statistics are available for the first game;{{sfn|Freyer & Rucker|2005|p=14}} Adams scored twice for the Knickerbockers in the second. In 1853, Adams played in two games against the Gotham Ball Club, tallying seven runs in a pair of victories.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|pp=226\u2013227}} The two clubs met three times from June to October 1854, and Adams had one run in each game.

Adams competed four times for the club against outside opponents in 1856 as it won once, lost twice, and had one tie; he scored ten times, and records for two games showed that his defensive position was [[shortstop]]. The Knickerbockers had a 2\u20132 win\u2013loss record in competitive games during 1857 that Adams participated in. Playing three times at shortstop and once at [[first base]] defensively, he contributed 12 runs offensively, including a six-run effort in the Knickerbockers' 37\u201323 victory over the Empire club on June 24. In 1858, Adams made four appearances for the Knickerbockers against outside opposition and scored nine runs, but the team went 1\u20133 in the games.

The only infielders were the players covering each of the bases; if there were more than eight players, extra [[outfielder]]s were sometimes used. The outfielders had difficulty throwing baseballs into the infield, because of the balls' light weight.

The shortstop filled one of the two gaps.{{sfn|Schiff|2008|p=48}}\n\nAdams hit left-handed; he said that his batted balls occasionally went into a river by the [[Elysian Fields, Hoboken, New Jersey|Elysian Fields]], the ground in [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], New Jersey, where the Knickerbockers practiced and played.{{sfn|Ward & Burns|1994|pp=4\u20135}} Adams had a long on-field career with the Knickerbockers; he remained a player with the team until 1859.{{sfn|Thorn|2011|p=106}} He did not limit his play to shortstop; he fielded at every position except [[pitcher]].{{sfn|Husman|2000|p=5}} Little is known about the relative performance of early baseball players, and the game was largely recreational, as opposed to competitive. Thorn speculates that Adams may have been \"the best player of the 1840s\", citing his lengthy playing career as evidence.{{sfn|Thorn|2011|pp=105\u2013106}}\n\n==Equipment maker and umpire==\nIn addition to playing the game, Adams was involved in the production of early baseball equipment. He personally manufactured [[Baseball (ball)|baseballs]] for a period of time, supplying many New York City-based clubs. Adams found that when the ball was more tightly stitched, it traveled further when batted or thrown.{{sfn|Thorn|1993|p=6}}{{sfn|Schaefer|2009|pp=88\u201389}} According to author [[Peter Morris (writer)|Peter Morris]], Adams' ball-manufacturing efforts helped to keep the Knickerbockers in operation during their first few years, as they would otherwise have had difficulty finding balls.{{sfn|Morris|2008|pp=10, 31}} In later years Adams gathered rubber from old [[galoshes]] for the insides of baseballs. A [[Tanning (leather)|tanner]] then used [[Glossary of baseball (H)#horsehide|horsehide]] to create the balls.<ref name=\"founder\"/> As late as 1863, Adams was one of the three most prominent makers of baseballs in New York, continuing to produce them by hand.{{sfn|Hample|2011|p=94}} Adams also played a role in producing [[baseball bats]], choosing which wood to use and overseeing the manufacturing process.<ref name=\"founder\"/>\n\nAdams also worked occasionally as an [[Umpire (baseball)|umpire]] in significant games.{{sfn|Husman|2000|p=5}} One notable example was the final contest of a three-game series between all-star teams from Brooklyn and New York City, held on September 10, 1858, in Long Island. During the game, which the New York City all-stars won 29\u201318, Adams became the first umpire to use a new rule allowing for a [[Strike zone|strike]] to be called against a batter who did not swing at a pitch in the strike zone. Previously, strikes were only called when a batter swung at a pitch and missed. Three batters were ruled out on strikes called by Adams in the game.{{sfn|Thorn|2011|pp=75, 116, 119}}{{sfn|Morris|2008|p=71}} Otherwise, the called strike rule was not applied often in its first few years of existence.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|p=181}}\n\n==Knickerbockers and NABBP executive==\n[[File:Knickerbocker baseball team.jpg|thumb|left|Adams standing in the middle of a group of New York Knickerbockers in 1859|alt=Seven members of the New York Knickerbockers baseball team standing on a field.

At the club's second election, held on May 5, 1846, Adams was named the Knickerbockers' vice president. At an April 1847 meeting, he became the president of the team, and was re-elected in 1848 and 1849.{{sfn|Freyer & Rucker|2005|pp=11\u201313}} He was the leader of a \"Committee to Revive the Constitution and By-Laws\" of baseball in 1848.{{sfn|Thorn|2011|p=35}} Adams was not chosen as an officer in 1851, but the next year was named one of the club's three treasurers; he was elected to the same position the following two years.{{sfn|Freyer & Rucker|2005|pp=13\u201314}} The number of baseball teams in the New York City area started to grow during the early 1850s, as the Washington Base Ball Club (also known as the Gotham Ball Club) and Eagle Base Ball Club were founded or reorganized.{{sfn|Thorn|1993|pp=6\u20137}} The Eagle Base Ball Club, desiring a unified set of rules, sent a message to the Knickerbockers requesting that a committee be formed. Adams was one of the three Knickerbockers members selected to be on the committee, and the clubs agreed on a set of rules, which were presented at the Knickerbockers' meeting on April 1, 1854. At the same meeting, Adams was voted into the position of club director.{{sfn|Freyer & Rucker|2005|p=15}}\n\nAfter again being named a director in 1855, Adams became president of the Knickerbockers for the fourth time, winning an election held at the club's April 5, 1856, meeting.

No rules existed at the time regarding team size, but official games between clubs were typically played with nine men per club. The proposal was defeated by a 13\u201311 vote, in favor of a rule forbidding non-club members to play if there were 14 players (seven per team).{{sfn|Thorn|2011|pp=51\u201352}}\n\nA two-man committee was created with the aim of working with the Eagle and Washington clubs to resolve the debate over how many players to field in official games.

His partner on the committee, Curry, had led the opposition to nine-man teams. Adams and Curry also differed on another issue: the length of games.{{sfn|Thorn|2011|pp=51\u201352}} At the time, a baseball game lasted until one of the teams had 21 runs; that team was awarded the victory.<ref name=\"founder\"/> A change in how games were won was deemed necessary after the suspended game in 1854. Adams favored nine-inning games, while Curry wanted contests to last seven innings. A convention was scheduled for early 1857, and Adams joined a three-man committee tasked with encouraging local clubs to send delegates.{{sfn|Thorn|2011|p=52}} At the convention, which consisted of one session each in January and February, Adams was voted president.{{sfn|Hershberger|2013|p=32}} The Knickerbockers had voted among themselves to back seven-inning games, but the other teams backed a motion for nine-inning contests, which passed.{{sfn|Thorn|2011|pp=52\u201353}}\n\nThese changes were incorporated in the \"Laws of Base Ball\", written by Adams.{{sfn|Thorn|2015|pp=91\u201392}} He authored the initial draft of the regulations with what ''[[The New York Times]]''' [[Richard Sandomir]] called \"an upright script and strong hand.\"<ref name=\"block\">{{cite news|last=Sandomir|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Sandomir|title=Back on the Auction Block, a 19th-Century Document Essential to Baseball's Rules|work=The New York Times|date=February 28, 2016|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/29/sports/baseball/back-on-the-auction-block-a-19th-century-document-essential-to-baseballs-rules.html|accessdate=May 27, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317053813/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/29/sports/baseball/back-on-the-auction-block-a-19th-century-document-essential-to-baseballs-rules.html|archivedate=March 17, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The \"Laws\" included regulations governing bat and ball sizes, and a ban on betting by players and umpires.{{sfn|Hershberger|2013|pp=33, 37, 41}} Fellow Knickerbocker William H.

Among other changes, part of the rule Adams had written on game length was crossed out; the number nine was replaced with seven, before the motion that settled the issue was introduced.<ref name=\"block\"/> In March, the Knickerbockers changed their rules to match those passed at the convention.{{sfn|Thorn|2011|p=53}} In May 1857, Adams presided over a player convention where nine-inning games were officially made part of the rules of baseball for participating teams.{{sfn|Thorn|1993|p=7}}\n\n===Distance between bases and campaign against bound rule===\nIn March 1858, the [[National Association of Base Ball Players]] (NABBP) was formed at another convention.{{sfn|Thorn|1993|p=7}} Adams was one of the Knickerbockers' two delegates, having been selected at a February meeting attended by representatives from 25 clubs.{{sfn|Freyer & Rucker|2005|p=18}} He held the chairmanship of the association's rules and regulations committee, and drafted the new organization's initial set of rules. These included a clarification of the prescribed distance between [[Base (baseball)|bases]], which under [[Knickerbocker Rules]] had been set at \"forty-two paces\" between home plate and second base, and \"forty-two paces, equidistant\" between first and third base.{{sfn|Thorn|1993|pp=6\u20137}} Historians differ on whether the bases were roughly {{convert|90|ft|m|sp=us}} apart, or a shorter distance.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|p=34}} Thorn has written that the pace itself may have been \"an imprecise and variable measure, to gauge distances by 'stepping off',\" and Adams described the rule as \"rather vague.\"{{sfn|Thorn|1993|pp=6\u20137}} At the 1857 convention, it was decided that bases would be \"securely fastened upon the four corners of a square whose sides are roughly thirty yards.\"{{sfn|Hershberger|2013|p=33}} As rules committee chairman for the new NABBP, Adams made the baselines {{convert|90|ft|m|sp=us}} from one base to another, the distance seen in modern baseball. He ruled on the distance between home plate and the pitcher's mound as well, making them {{convert|45|ft|m|sp=us}} apart.{{sfn|Thorn|2011|pp=28, 35\u201336}} In addition, the committee mandated that clubs have nine players per side, which became the norm.<ref name=\"invent\"/>{{sfn|Thorn|2011|p=51}} It also created the called strike rule, in an effort to reduce pitch totals and the time required to play games.{{sfn|Morris, Ryczek, Finkel, Levin & Malatzky|2013|p=3}}\n\nAdams campaigned for a further change in the rules of baseball, involving when outs were recorded. At the time, an out was allowed when the ball was caught by a fielder after one bounce; this was known as the \"bound rule\".{{sfn|Morris|2008|p=67}} Adams supported a ban on such outs, calling his preferred rule \"the fly-game\".{{sfn|Thorn|1993|p=7}} Under the style of play he backed, when a [[Batted ball|fly ball]] was hit a fielder would have to catch the ball before it touched the ground for an out to be made. This was similar to rules on catches in [[cricket]], and would serve to increase the level of skill required from fielders.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|pp=174\u2013175}} The Knickerbockers had enacted a rule mandating the \"fly-catch\" by 1857.{{sfn|Schiff|2008|p=54}}\n\nThe Knickerbockers attempted to introduce the fly rule more widely at the 1857 convention, with a proposal that permitted the continued use of the bound rule for [[foul ball]]s. Despite widespread support from sportswriters, the proposed rule change was voted down. Writer William Hershberger said that the decision showed \"the limits of the Knickerbockers' influence and divisions within the baseball fraternity.\"{{sfn|Hershberger|2013|pp=41\u201342}} The rule change was proposed to the NABBP annually by Adams but did not pass. At the 1858 NABBP convention, a vote on eliminating the bound rule was unsuccessful.{{sfn|Ryczek|2009|p=175}} Opponents raised concerns that the proposal would dramatically lengthen game times.{{sfn|Schiff|2008|p=54}} Despite his support for the fly rule, in 1858 Adams successfully motioned for NABBP regulations, including outs on bounces, to apply to the Knickerbockers. He did so because he was reluctant to oppose the rules of the NABBP.

The first capital of Guatemala was founded on the site of a Kakchikel-Maya city, now called [[Iximche]], on Monday, July 25, 1524\u2014the day of Saint James\u2014and therefore named [[Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala|Ciudad de Santiago de los Caballeros de Goathemalan]] (City of [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James]] of the Knights of Guatemala). Naturally, St. James became the patron saint of the city. {{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nAfter several [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]] uprisings, the capital was moved to a more suitable site in the Valley of Almolonga (place of water) on November 22, 1527, and kept its original name. This new city was located on the site of present-day San Miguel Escobar,<ref>Lutz, Christopher H. (1997) ''Santiago de Guatemala, 1541-1773: City, Caste, and the Colonial Experience'' University of Oklahoma Press, pp.10 & 258</ref> which is a neighborhood in the municipality of [[Ciudad Vieja]].{{sfn|Santos|2011|p=}} This city was destroyed on September 11, 1541 by a devastating [[lahar]] from the [[Volc\u00e1n de Agua]].<ref name=gvp>{{cite gvp | vn=342100 | title=Agua | accessdate=2008-08-03}}</ref> As a result, the colonial authorities decided to move the capital once more, this time five miles away to the Panchoy Valley. So, on March 10, 1543 the Spanish conquistadors founded present-day Antigua, and again, it was named Santiago de los Caballeros. {{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} For more than 200 years, it served as the seat of the military governor of the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala|Spanish colony of Guatemala]], a large region that included almost all of present-day [[Central America]] and the southernmost State of Mexico: [[Chiapas]].\n\nSantiago de los Caballeros was the third seat of the capital called kingdom of Guatemala, which included the current states of Guatemala, [[Belize]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]] and [[Costa Rica]], besides modern state of [[Chiapas]] in [[Mexico]].  After a flood destroyed the second city, located in the Valley of Almolonga, on the slopes of Volc\u00e1n de Agua a new city was built in 1543 in the Valley of Panchoy, and it was established as head of the Real Audiencia of Guatemala in 1549.{{sfn|Sociedad Estatal Quinto Centenario|1993|p=13}}\n\nThe city was laid out in a square pattern, with streets running north to south and from east to west, with a central square.  Both church and government buildings were designated important places around the central plaza.{{sfn|Rodr\u00edguez Gir\u00f3n|Flores|Garnica|1995|p=585}}<ref group=Note>This square was also called \"Plaza Mayor\", \"Plaza Real\" and \"Plaza de Armas\".</ref>  Between 1549 and 1563, property southeast of the square was sold to the crown and occupied by the first president of the Real Audiencia de los Confines: the lawyer Alonso Lopez Cerrato, who also served as governor and captain general.{{sfn|Rodr\u00edguez Gir\u00f3n|Flores|Garnica|1995|p=585}}<ref group=Note>Previously the audience was in the city of \"Gracias a Dios\" in Honduras, but there it lacked the appropriate conditions for its activities.</ref> The original building was small and paneled with portal, tile roof, and adobe walls.  The city is surrounded by three enormous volcanoes and mountains, plains and hills. This territory was called \"Valley of Guatemala\" and had 73 villages, two towns and the city of Santiago de los Caballeros.{{sfn|Melchor Toledo|2011|p=49}}\n\nDue to constant problems between the conquerors and the representatives of the crown sent by the king of Spain, the Audiencia de los Confines was abolished in 1565.<ref group=Note>The Audiencia was called \"of the Confines\" because it was within the confines of [[New Spain]] and [[Per\u00fa]].</ref> In 1570 the assembly was restored, this time independent of the viceroy of Mexico and the new organization was called Audiencia of Guatemala.{{sfn|Melchor Toledo|2011|p=50}}\n\nThe [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] friars were the first to move into the valley Panchoy, the new capital of the Kingdom of Guatemala, and built a chapel on the site where later the Church Escuela de Cristo would be erected.  This primitive chapel was destroyed in 1575 by an earthquake and during the next ten years collections were made to build the new complex, two blocks from the previous one.<ref group=Note>Parts of this construction are still preserved and may be the only ruins dating from the 16th century in the city of Antigua Guatemala.</ref> The Franciscan complex became a major cultural and religious center for the entire Captaincy General of Guatemala: Theologians, jurists, philosophers, physicists, and mathematicians studied in the school of San Buenaventura, which was located where the monastery ruins are.

Their hospitals were: \n* San Alejo: for indigenous people\n* San Pedro: for ecclesiastical personnel\n* Santiago: for Spanish and mulattos \n* San L\u00e1zaro \n* San Juan de Dios: in 1667 the hospital of San Alejo was delivered to the Brothers of San Juan de Dios by the [[Order of Preachers|Dominicans]] who had managed it until then; in 1685, San Alejo and Santiago hospitals joined together, forming the Hospital San Juan de Dios.{{sfn|Melchor Toledo|2011|p=64}}\n\nThe temple of the Escuela de Cristo -School of Christ- was founded in the parish of Our Lady of Remedios in 1664 and from 1689 onward it was known as the Congregation of San Felipe de Neri.  Meanwhile, around 1690, the Jesuits founded another school: the \"San Francisco de Borja\" where the poet and priest Rafael Landivar, [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]], eventually would study and serve as principal.\n\nIn the seventeenth century there were two types of nuns: discalced and urban.{{sfn|Anchisi de Rodr\u00edguez|2014|p=24:35}}\n\n{| class=\"mw-collapsible wikitable\"  style=\"margin: 1em auto; width:70%; font-size:90%;\"\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n!style=\"background:#659ec7; width:15%;\"|Attribute\n!style=\"background:#659ec7;\" align=center|Discalced nuns\n!style=\"background:#659ec7;\" |Urban nuns\n|-\n!style=\"background:lemonchiffon;\"|Designation\n|Community life||Private life  \n|-\n!style=\"background:lemonchiffon;\"|Admission cost\n|None||Donation in goods or property to produce revenues for the congregation\n|-\n!style=\"background:lemonchiffon;\"|Lifestyle\n|Enclosed||Enclosed\n|-\n!style=\"background:lemonchiffon;\"|Prayer\n|In the chorus||In the chorus  \n|-\n!style=\"background:lemonchiffon;\"|Austerity rules\n|Strict: depended on tithing, silent at all times, except to pray and never drank chocolate.<ref group=Note>The chocolate was the drink of choice in Guatemala during the colonial era.

Upon arrival he suffered a serious illness, during which he had the first opportunity to be with the poor and dispossessed.  After his recovery he wanted to pursue ecclesiastical studies but unable to do so, professed as a Franciscan tertiary in the Convent of San Francisco in Santiago de los Caballeros. He founded shelters for the poor, indigenous, and homeless, and founded the Order of the Brothers of Our Lady of Bethlehem in 1656, to serve the poor.{{sfn|Esparza|n.d.|p=}} Santo Hermano Pedro wrote several books, including: Instruction De la Cruz's brother, Crown of the Passion of Jesus Christ our good or Rules Confraternity Betlemitas.  He is considered the great evangelist of the West Indies, just as San Francisco Javier is to the East Indies.  Brother Pedro attended to the poor, sick, orphaned, and dying, and was an early promoter of Human Rights. Additionally, he was the first literacy advocate in America, and the Order of Betlemitas in turn was the first religious order born in the Americas. The Santo Hermano Pedro was a man ahead of his time, both in his methods of teaching reading and writing to the illiterate and in medical patient treatment.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\n==== Royal and pontifical University of San Carlos Borromeo ====\n{{Main|University of San Carlos of Guatemala}}\n[[File:Antigua university courtyard.JPG|thumb|200px|[[University of San Carlos of Guatemala|Royal and Pontifical University of San Carlos Borromeo]]. Picture from 1971]]\n\n[[Francisco Marroqu\u00edn]], first bishop of Guatemala, sent the Spanish King a letter in 1548, asking for a superior education institution for [[Guatemala]], but the letter went unanswered. Towards the end of his life, in 1562, Marroqu\u00edn left some money in his will to establish a school -which eventually was the \"Santo Tom\u00e1s de Aquino school\"- where grammar, arts, philosophy, and theology would be taught. Poor Spanish children would be the beneficiaries of this pious work, as they could not travel to those cities where there were universities already, such as [[M\u00e9xico City]] in the [[New Spain]]. Historian John Tate Lanning said regarding this that, \"Marroqu\u00edn's testament is so famous, that many people who have not even laid eyes on it say that there are things in the document that are really not in it. Marroqu\u00edn never talks about a University, much less establishing one...\"{{sfn|Tate Lanning|1977|p=8}} On the other hand, there is indeed a document from Mayor Pedro Crespo Suarez, who left twenty thousand pesos after his death to set up classes in the University that \"was being asked of the crown\".{{sfn|Hern\u00e1ndez de Le\u00f3n|1928|p=}}\n\nThe [[Jesuits]] opposed a university establishment, given that they did not like the idea of having the other [[regular clergy]] orders -[[Mercedarians]], [[Franciscans]] and [[Order of Preachers]]- taking the initiative in religious and educational issues.{{sfn|Hern\u00e1ndez de Le\u00f3n|1928|p=}} In August 1655, the [[Church and Convent of Society of Jesus (Antigua Guatemala)|Society of Jesus]] had bought the whole lot from the D\u00edaz del Castillo family and by then, their San Lucas School was well known in the region and it even granted two university degrees.{{sfn|Agencia Espa\u00f1ola de Cooperaci\u00f3n Internacional para el Desarrollo|2008|p=8}} In 1653, the San Lucas School had a staff of only thirteen priests, a very small number compared to the size of the building; the Jesuits, however, made a major impact on the cultural and educational life in the [[Kingdom of Guatemala|Capitan\u00eda General of Guatemala]]. The school was the city's most prestigious, and from it graduated most of the elite members of society of the time. Most of its students were secular and went on to get the best positions in the country.{{sfn|Agencia Espa\u00f1ola de Cooperaci\u00f3n Internacional para el Desarrollo|2008|p=8}}\n\nAfter several decades, petitions, and lawsuits, king [[Charles II of Spain|Carlos II]] expedited a royal decree, on January 31, 1676, allowing [[Kingdom of Guatemala|Capitan\u00eda General of Guatemala]] to establish its university or \"General Study.\"<ref group=Note>During the Spanish colony, \"General Study\" was another name for the universities.</ref> After a lengthy and cumbersome organizational process that lasted five years, the university started classes on January 7, 1681, with more than sixty registered students under President Doctor Jos\u00e9 de Ba\u00f1os y Soto Mayor, Cathedral archdeacon, King of Spain preacher and Doctor from the University of Osuna.{{sfn|Hern\u00e1ndez de Le\u00f3n|1928|p=}} The university began its activities under the protection of Saint Carlos Borromeo, and its norms and regulations were copied from those of the M\u00e9xico University which, in turn, were adapted from those of the [[Universidad de Salamanca]] in Spain.\n\nThe first classes given in the university were:\n* Canonic law\n* Medicine\n* Scholastic theology\n* Moral theology\n* Languages\n\nThe Royal University of San Carlos Borromeo became pontifical via the [[Papal Bull]] of [[Pope Innocent XI]], issued and dated 18 June 1687.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\n=== 18th-century events ===\n\n==== San Miguel Earthquake====\n{{Main|1717 Guatemala earthquake}}\n[[File:Antigua, Guatemala. Iglesia derruida.jpg|thumb|250px|A church damaged by an earthquake]]\n\nThe strongest earthquakes experienced by the city of Santiago de los Caballeros before its final move in 1776 were the [[1717 Guatemala earthquake|San Miguel earthquakes]] in 1717.  At that time, the power of the [[Catholic Church]] over the Spanish Empire's citizens was absolute and any natural disaster was considered as divine punishment.  In the city, people also believed that the proximity of the [[Volc\u00e1n de Fuego]] (English: Volcano of Fire) was the cause of earthquakes; the great architect Diego de Porres even said that all the earthquakes were caused by volcano explosions.{{sfn|Melchor Toledo|2011|p=103}}\n\nOn August 27 there was a strong eruption of [[Volc\u00e1n de Fuego]], which lasted until August 30;  the residents of the city asked for help to Santo Cristo of the Cathedral and to the Virgen del Socorro who were sworn patrons of the [[Volcan de Fuego]].  On August 29, a Virgen del Rosario procession took to the streets after a century without leaving her temple, and there were many more holy processions until 29 September, the day of San Miguel.  Early afternoon earthquakes were minor, but at about 7:00&nbsp;p.m. there was a strong earthquake that forced residents to leave their homes; tremors and rumblings followed until four o'clock.  The neighbors took to the streets and loudly confessed their sins, bracing for the worst.<ref name=melchor104>{{harvnb|Melchor Toledo|2011|p=104}}</ref>\n\nThe San Miguel earthquake damaged the city considerably, to the point that some rooms and walls of the Royal Palace were destroyed.  There was also a partial abandonment of the city, food shortages, lack of manpower, and extensive damage to the city infrastructure, not to mention numerous dead and injured.<ref name=melchor104/> These earthquakes made the authorities consider moving to a new city less prone to seismic activity.  City residents strongly opposed the move, and even took to the Royal Palace in protest; in the end, the city did not move, but the number of troops of the Army Battalion required to maintain order was considerable.{{sfn|Rodr\u00edguez Gir\u00f3n|Flores|Garnica|1995|p=585}}  The damage to the palace were repaired by Diego de Porres, who finished repairs in 1720, although there are indications that there were additional work done by Porres until 1736.{{sfn|Rodr\u00edguez Gir\u00f3n|Flores|Garnica|1995|p=585}}\n\n==== San Casimiro earthquake ====\nOn March 4, 1751, the [[1751 Guatemala earthquake|San Casimiro earthquake]] destroyed the city of Santiago de Guatemala once more.  The church roof of the [[Church and Convent of the Society of Jesus (Antigua Guatemala)|Society of Jesus complex]] fell to the ground, forcing the Jesuits once again to ask for help from the parishioners to rebuild.  Once again, the building was among the most beautiful in the city when the repairs were completed.{{sfn|Agencia Espa\u00f1ola de Cooperaci\u00f3n Internacional para el Desarrollo|2008|p=9}} In fact, a period of prosperity began after the San Casimiro earthquake, as the city saw major improvements such as street embellishment and the introduction of a tap water system.  A new City Hall was built, and on July 17, 1753, work on the Jesuit plaza in front of the church was finished.{{sfn|Agencia Espa\u00f1ola de Cooperaci\u00f3n Internacional para el Desarrollo|2008|p=9}}\n\n==== Santa Marta earthquake ====\n{{Main|Santa Marta earthquake}}\n{{multiple image |align=right |direction=vertical |width=200px\n |image1=Patiodelosjesuitas.jpg |caption1=Ruins of the [[Church and Convent of Society of Jesus (Antigua Guatemala)|Society of Jesus]] school yard in 1880\n |image2=Interiordelosjesuitas.jpg |caption2=Ruins of the [[Church and Convent of Society of Jesus (Antigua Guatemala)|Society of Jesus]] church interior in 1880\n}}\n\nOn 12 June 1773 Captain General [[Mart\u00edn de Mayorga]] was inaugurated, and alongside Cort\u00e9s y Larr\u00e1z and the [[regular clergy]] vicars, were the top authorities in the Kingdom of Guatemala and would be the main characters in the events that followed the 1773 earthquakes.{{sfn|Melchor Toledo|2011|p=117}}\n\nIn 1773, the [[Santa Marta earthquake]]s destroyed much of the town, which led to the third change in location for the city.{{sfn|Foster|2000|p=}} The [[Spanish monarchy|Spanish Crown]] ordered, in 1776, the removal of the capital to a safer location, the Valley of the Shrine, where [[Guatemala City]], the modern capital of Guatemala, now stands. This new city did not retain its old name and was christened Nueva Guatemala de la Asunci\u00f3n (New Guatemala of the Assumption), and its patron saint is Our Lady of the Assumption. The badly damaged city of Santiago de los Caballeros was ordered abandoned, although not everyone left, and was thereafter referred to as la Antigua Guatemala (the Old Guatemala).{{sfn|Foster|2000|p=}}\n\nThe Santa Marta earthquake practically demolished the church and sections of the convent of the Society of Jesus.  Its cloisters and towers were in ruins, the walls were at dangerous angles, and the \"Casa de Ejercicios\" was turned into rubble. By a Royal decree of July 21, 1775, the city move to the \"Virgin valley\" was authorized.  This was a final order that had to be obeyed by all the people, who started to move slowly, starting on December of that year. In order to build the new city it was necessary to get construction material from the old abandoned churches in Santiago de Guatemala.  However, in the case of the Society of Jesus church, there was strong opposition from the neighbors to any possible dismantling of the structure since they considered that it could still be repaired.{{sfn|Agencia Espa\u00f1ola de Cooperaci\u00f3n Internacional para el Desarrollo|2008|p=11}}\n\n=== 19th-century events ===\n\n==== After the capital moved to La Ermita ====\n[[File:1887 Guatemala 1C Yv44.jpg|thumb|left|Postmark ANTIGUA CANCELADO in 1887, after Guatemala joined the UPU.

With respect to traffic, it was almost non-existent, aside from mule-pulled wagons\".{{sfn|Wilhelm of Sweden|1922|p=177}}\n\nAfter passing Mixco, the road proceeded more steeply upward, with a precipitous drop on one side and sheer cliff rising on the other; here and there a cross stood by the wayside, marking the spot where some traveler had died.  After reaching the highest point, they started down towards Antigua.  The city was in sight when a person in uniform planted himself in front of the car; it turned out to be the city commandant, along with six soldiers with wooden guns.{{sfn|Wilhelm of Sweden|1922|p=178}} Compared to Guatemala City at the time, Antigua was quite nicely kept, although all the churches were equally dilapidated and left entirely to themselves, as rebuilding since 1773 was confined to the strictly necessary. For the most part, only blank walls and shattered domes remained to greet the visitor by 1920,{{sfn|Wilhelm of Sweden|1922|p=179}} and some of the churches were in pitiful conditions.  In Santa Clara, for example, a mule was grazing, and in the Church of Grace a native family had taken up its quarters, along with their varied collection of domestic animals.{{sfn|Wilhelm of Sweden|1922|p=180}}\n\nBut there were other monuments in decent shape: \n* The Escuela de Cristo was one of the best preserved churches and was united with a convent that was still standing.  The priest that received the Prince and his three companions told them that all the silver and gold from the church had already been sold by his predecessors, so that he, to his extreme regret, was unable to sell any to them.{{sfn|Wilhelm of Sweden|1922|p=180}}\n* The old [[Church and Convent of Capuchins|Capuchin]] monastery with its many underground passages from the monks' cells to those of the nuns was worth a visit, especially one part where the cells were built in a circle surrounding a central common chamber.{{sfn|Wilhelm of Sweden|1922|p=180}}\n\n== Antigua Guatemala in the 21st century ==\n[[File:Guatemala 176.jpg|thumb|[[Antigua Guatemala Cathedral|San Jos\u00e9 Parish]] in the former Metropolitan Cathedral of Santiago.]]\n\nCentral Park \u2013 Parque Central \u2013 is the heart of the city, with the reconstructed fountain there acting as a popular gathering spot. To the north of the Central Park is the Arco de Santa Catalina, one of the most recognizable architectural landmarks of Antigua.\n\nLa Antigua is noted for its very elaborate religious celebrations during [[Lent]] ([[Cuaresma]]), leading up to [[Holy Week]] (''Semana Santa'') and [[Easter]] (''Pascua''). Each Sunday during Lent, one of the local [[parish]]es sponsors a [[Procession]] through the streets of Antigua. Elaborate and artistic carpets, predominantly made of dyed sawdust, flowers, pine needles, and even fruits and vegetables, adorn the processions' paths. {{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nDue to its popularity among tourists and its very well-developed tourism infrastructure, Antigua Guatemala is often used as a central location from which to visit other tourist areas in Guatemala and Central America. Cruise ships that dock at Guatemalan ports offer trips to Antigua from both the Pacific and Atlantic. Antigua also holds a sizeable retirement community of expatriates from the US and Europe. {{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Economy==\nHistorically, the area was considered to be one of the finest agriculturally in Guatemala.{{sfn|Baily|1850|p=78}} Tourism is the main driver of the economy.  Antigua is also a coffee-producing region of [[Anacaf\u00e9]].\n\n[[File:Antigua, Guatemala.jpg|thumb|Tourists visiting Antigua, 2005]]\n\n==Language schools==\nAntigua is known as a destination for people who want to learn Spanish through immersion. There are many Spanish language schools in Antigua, and it is one of the most popular and best recognized centers for Spanish language study by students from Europe, Asia, and North America. Language institutes are one of the primary industries of Antigua, along with tourism.\n\n==Sports==\n[[Antigua GFC]] football club plays in the Guatemalan top division. Their home stadium is the [[Estadio Pensativo]], which has a capacity of 9,000. They are nicknamed ''Los panzas verdes'' (\"Green bellies\") and have been successful nationally, having won the title four times since 2015.\n\n==Cuisine==\nThere are many restaurants in Antigua. Small eateries can be found at the Antigua marketplace next to the central bus stop, where you will find traditional Guatemalan dishes such as the traditional/[[Guatemala|Chapin]] breakfast, for example: refried beans, fried egg, fried plantain, and fresh cheese, served with handmade [[tortillas]]. Throughout Antigua you can find many cuisines from around the world: Mediterranean, Italian, Asian, American, and British pies and French pastries.\n\n==Health==\nAntigua is served by two main hospitals, Hospital Nacional Pedro de Bethancourt and a [[Guatemalan Institute of Social Security]] hospital.<ref>[https://www.guatemala.com/guias/salud/lugares-donar-sangre-guatemala/hospital-nacional-pedro-de-bethancourt-sacatepequez.html Hospital Nacional Pedro De Bethancourt Sacatepequez]</ref> [[Emergency medical services]] are provided by [[Bomberos Municipales (Guatemala)]] and [[Bomberos Voluntarios (Guatemala)]], who have both previously worked with [[LFR International]] to improve prehospital care.<ref>{{Citation|title=LFR International in Guatemala|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8EAGX59QBc|language=en|access-date=2019-08-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Delaney|first=Peter G.|last2=Figueroa|first2=Jose A.|last3=Eisner|first3=Zachary J.|last4=Andrade|first4=Rudy Erik Hernandez|last5=Karmakar|first5=Monita|last6=Scott|first6=John W.|last7=Raghavendran|first7=Krishnan|date=2020-04-01|title=Designing and implementing a practical prehospital emergency trauma care curriculum for lay first responders in Guatemala|url=https://tsaco.bmj.com/content/5/1/e000409|journal=Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open|language=en|volume=5|issue=1|pages=e000409|doi=10.1136/tsaco-2019-000409|issn=2397-5776}}</ref>\n\n==Ecology==\n[[Image:Antigua2.JPG|thumb|Arch connecting two parts of old Convent, Volc\u00e1n de Agua in background]]\n\nThree large [[volcano]]es dominate the horizon around Antigua. The most commanding, to the south of the city, is the [[Volc\u00e1n de Agua]] or \"Volcano of Water\", some {{convert|3766|m}} high. When the Spanish arrived, the inhabitants of the area, [[Kaqchikel people|Kakchikel Mayas]], called it Hunap\u00fa (and they still do). However, it became known as Volc\u00e1n de Agua after a [[lahar]] from the volcano buried the second site of the capital, which prompted the Spanish authorities to move the capital to present-day Antigua. The original site of the second capital is now the village [[San Miguel Escobar]].\n\nTo the west of the city are a pair of peaks, [[Acatenango]], which last erupted in 1972, some {{convert|3976|m}} high, and the [[Volc\u00e1n de Fuego]] or \"Volcano of Fire\", some {{convert|3763|m}} high. \"Fuego\" is famous for being almost constantly active at a low level. Steam and gas issue from its top almost daily, while a larger eruption occurred in September 2012.\n\n==Tourism==\n{{See also|La Aurora International Airport}}\n\nAntigua is a growing tourist destination in Guatemala as it is close to [[Guatemala City]] but is much calmer and safer, with more tourist oriented activities.  It is possible to take buses from Antigua to many parts of Guatemala.  Many travel agencies offer shuttles to the main tourist places: Monterrico beach, [[Atitlan Lake]], Coban, [[Lanqu\u00edn]] (Semuc Champey), or [[Tikal]], though the transportation is more central in Guatemala City. Antigua is also known for its chocolate makers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitguatemala.com/es/agencias/listar/4/sacatepequez |title=Agencias de Viajes en Sacatep\u00e9quez |website=Visit Guatemala |author=INGUAT |accessdate=20 August 2015 |language=es |ref=harv |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150820213914/http://www.visitguatemala.com/es/agencias/listar/4/sacatepequez |archivedate=August 20, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n===Spanish Colony monuments===\n{{Location map many| Antigua Guatemala\n|caption=Some of Antigua Guatemala colonial monuments\n | label=[[San Francisco Church (Antigua Guatemala)|San Francisco]]| position=bottom|label_size=70\n      | lat=14.553884| long=-90.729762|bg=white\n | label2=[[Palace of the Captain Generals (Guatemala)|Palace]]|label2_size=70\n      | pos2=left|bg2=white\n      | lat2=14.556169|long2=-90.733667\n | label3=City Hall|label3_size=70\n      | pos3=top|bg3=white\n      | lat3=14.557415|long3=-90.733399\n | label4=[[Antigua Guatemala Cathedral|Cathedral]]|label4_size=70\n      | pos4=right|bg4=white\n      | lat4=14.556782|long4=-90.733045\n | label5=[[University of San Carlos of Guatemala|University]]|label5_size=70\n      | pos5=bottom|bg5=white\n      | lat5=14.556003|long5=-90.732444\n|label6=[[Santo Domingo Monastery]]|label6_size=70\n|pos6=bottom|bg6=white\n|lat6=14.558755|long6=-90.726865\n|label7=[[La Merced Church, Antigua Guatemala|La Merced]]|label7_size=70\n|pos7=top|bg7=white\n|lat7=14.561236|long7=-90.734611\n|label8=[[Church and Convent of Capuchins|Capuchins]]|label8_size=70\n|pos8=top|bg8=white\n|lat8=14.559814|long8=-90.731436\n|label9=[[La Recolecci\u00f3n Architectural Complex|La Recolecci\u00f3n]]|label9_size=70\n|pos9=bottom|bg9=white\n|lat9=14.560655|long9=-90.741188\n| float=right\n|width=220\n}}\n\nBefore it was declared a National Monument by president [[Jorge Ubico]] on March 30, 1944, the city ruins were practically abandoned. The following galleries show images of the destruction of the structures due to earthquakes and abandonment. There were other churches, such as Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Carmen and the Society of Jesus, that endured the 1773 earthquake relatively well, but they were abandoned and the earthquakes from 1917\u201318 and 1976 destroyed them. In the particular case of de San Francisco El Grande church, it was in good structural condition after the 1773 and 1917 earthquakes, and it was rebuilt in 1967 when the Franciscans returned to Guatemala. This eventually protected the structure from significant damage in the 1976 earthquake. Finally, La Merced church was practically new in 1773, and it has withstood time and earthquakes since; the church was not abandoned in 1776, but it was indeed abandoned in 1829 when the Mercedarians were expelled from Central America by general [[Francisco Moraz\u00e1n]], along with the rest of [[regular clergy]] and the conservative party members and [[Juan Jos\u00e9 de Aycinena y Pi\u00f1ol|Aycinena family]].{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Davison|2008|p=4-15}}\n\n{| class=\"mw-collapsible wikitable\"  style=\"margin: 1em auto; width:70%; font-size:90%;\" align=center \n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n!style=\"background:#659ec7; width:15%;\"|Name\n!style=\"background:#659ec7; width:25%;\"|Picture\n!style=\"background:#659ec7; width:75%;\"|Brief description\n|-\n!style=\"background:lemonchiffon;\"|[[Palace of the Captain Generals (Guatemala)|Captain General Palace]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |[[File:AntiguaSquareGovPalace79.jpg|150px]]\n|Residence of the [[Captain General]] of [[Kingdom of Guatemala|General Captaincy of Guatemala]] during the Spanish colony.

[[Guatemalan Highlands|central highlands]] of [[Guatemala]] known for its preserved [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Baroque]]-influenced architecture as well as a number of ruins of [[Spanish colony|colonial]] [[Church (building)|church]]es. It served as the capital of the [[Kingdom of Guatemala]]. It has been designated a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]].\n\nAntigua Guatemala serves as the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality of the same name. It also serves as the departmental capital of [[Sacatep\u00e9quez Department]].\n\n== Population ==\n[[File:\"Construction of the Cathedral of Santiago de Guatemala\" 1678 by Antonio Ram\u00edrez Mont\u00fafar.jpg|thumb|200px|Construction of the Cathedral of Santiago de Guatemala in 1678. Painting by Antonio Ram\u00edrez Mont\u00fafar]]\n\nThe city had a peak population of some 60,000 in the 1770s; the bulk of the population moved away in the late 18th century. Despite significant population growth in the late 20th century, the city had only reached half that number by the 1990s. At the time of the 2007 census, the city had 34,685 inhabitants. {{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:antigua guatemala ruins 2009.JPG|thumb|200px|Fa\u00e7ade of the former El Carmen church in 2009]]\n\n''Antigua Guatemala'' means \"Old Guatemala\" and was the third capital of Guatemala. The first capital of Guatemala was founded on the site of a Kakchikel-Maya city, now called [[Iximche]], on Monday, July 25, 1524\u2014the day of Saint James\u2014and therefore named [[Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala|Ciudad de Santiago de los Caballeros de Goathemalan]] (City of [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James]] of the Knights of Guatemala). Naturally, St. James became the patron saint of the city. {{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nAfter several [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]] uprisings, the capital was moved to a more suitable site in the Valley of Almolonga (place of water) on November 22, 1527, and kept its original name. This new city was located on the site of present-day San Miguel Escobar,<ref>Lutz, Christopher H. (1997) ''Santiago de Guatemala, 1541-1773: City, Caste, and the Colonial Experience'' University of Oklahoma Press, pp.10 & 258</ref> which is a neighborhood in the municipality of [[Ciudad Vieja]].{{sfn|Santos|2011|p=}} This city was destroyed on September 11, 1541 by a devastating [[lahar]] from the [[Volc\u00e1n de Agua]].<ref name=gvp>{{cite gvp | vn=342100 | title=Agua | accessdate=2008-08-03}}</ref> As a result, the colonial authorities decided to move the capital once more, this time five miles away to the Panchoy Valley. So, on March 10, 1543 the Spanish conquistadors founded present-day Antigua, and again, it was named Santiago de los Caballeros. {{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} For more than 200 years, it served as the seat of the military governor of the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala|Spanish colony of Guatemala]], a large region that included almost all of present-day [[Central America]] and the southernmost State of Mexico: [[Chiapas]].\n\nSantiago de los Caballeros was the third seat of the capital called kingdom of Guatemala, which included the current states of Guatemala, [[Belize]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]] and [[Costa Rica]], besides modern state of [[Chiapas]] in [[Mexico]].  After a flood destroyed the second city, located in the Valley of Almolonga, on the slopes of Volc\u00e1n de Agua a new city was built in 1543 in the Valley of Panchoy, and it was established as head of the Real Audiencia of Guatemala in 1549.{{sfn|Sociedad Estatal Quinto Centenario|1993|p=13}}\n\nThe city was laid out in a square pattern, with streets running north to south and from east to west, with a central square.  Both church and government buildings were designated important places around the central plaza.{{sfn|Rodr\u00edguez Gir\u00f3n|Flores|Garnica|1995|p=585}}<ref group=Note>This square was also called \"Plaza Mayor\", \"Plaza Real\" and \"Plaza de Armas\".</ref>  Between 1549 and 1563, property southeast of the square was sold to the crown and occupied by the first president of the Real Audiencia de los Confines: the lawyer Alonso Lopez Cerrato, who also served as governor and captain general.{{sfn|Rodr\u00edguez Gir\u00f3n|Flores|Garnica|1995|p=585}}<ref group=Note>Previously the audience was in the city of \"Gracias a Dios\" in Honduras, but there it lacked the appropriate conditions for its activities.</ref> The original building was small and paneled with portal, tile roof, and adobe walls.  The city is surrounded by three enormous volcanoes and mountains, plains and hills. This territory was called \"Valley of Guatemala\" and had 73 villages, two towns and the city of Santiago de los Caballeros.{{sfn|Melchor Toledo|2011|p=49}}\n\nDue to constant problems between the conquerors and the representatives of the crown sent by the king of Spain, the Audiencia de los Confines was abolished in 1565.<ref group=Note>The Audiencia was called \"of the Confines\" because it was within the confines of [[New Spain]] and [[Per\u00fa]].</ref> In 1570 the assembly was restored, this time independent of the viceroy of Mexico and the new organization was called Audiencia of Guatemala.{{sfn|Melchor Toledo|2011|p=50}}\n\nThe [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] friars were the first to move into the valley Panchoy, the new capital of the Kingdom of Guatemala, and built a chapel on the site where later the Church Escuela de Cristo would be erected.  This primitive chapel was destroyed in 1575 by an earthquake and during the next ten years collections were made to build the new complex, two blocks from the previous one.<ref group=Note>Parts of this construction are still preserved and may be the only ruins dating from the 16th century in the city of Antigua Guatemala.</ref> The Franciscan complex became a major cultural and religious center for the entire Captaincy General of Guatemala: Theologians, jurists, philosophers, physicists, and mathematicians studied in the school of San Buenaventura, which was located where the monastery ruins are. Notable students included Crist\u00f3bal de Villalpando, Thomas Merlo, and Alonso de Paz.\n\n[[File:Plaza central, Antigua Guatemala.JPG|thumb|200px|Mermaid Fountain, built by Diego de Porres in 1737,{{sfn|Calder\u00f3n|2011|p=}} Antigua Guatemala central square]]\nThe first building of a cathedral was begun in 1545 with the debris brought from the destroyed settlement in the valley of Almolonga; however, its construction was hampered by frequent earthquakes throughout the years.{{sfn|Antigua Guatemala en l\u00ednea|n.d.|p=}}  The city was the final resting place of the great Spanish chronicler [[Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo]], and his remains were interred in one of the churches that was eventually ruined by earthquakes.\n\nThe construction of the royal houses for the residence of the Captain General and the members of the [[Real Audiencia]] started in 1558; the complex also included the Royal Treasury, jail, Army quarters, the Hall of Arms, and the housing of Audiencia members.{{sfn|Rodr\u00edguez Gir\u00f3n|Flores|Garnica|1995|p=585}}\n\nIn the sixteenth century, there were several important earthquakes on the following dates: \n* March 21, 1530 \n* September 11, 1541 \n* 1565 (exact date unknown)\n* 1575 (exact date unknown)\n* November 30, 1577 \n* December 23, 1585{{sfn|Cadena|1774|p=19}}\n\nIn 1566 King Felipe II of Spain gave it the title of \"Muy Noble y Muy Leal\" (\"Very Noble and Very Loyal\").\n\n=== 17th-century events ===\n[[File:Jesussantaclar.jpg|200px|thumb|Replica of Jesus of Santa Clara]]\n\nThe [[Jesuits]] founded the school of \"San Lucas of the Society of Jesus\" in 1608, which became famous and was unrivaled in terms of literature and grammar lessons;  it was attended by the elite nobles of the city society, such as Francisco Antonio Fuentes y Guzman, the chronicler Francisco V\u00e1zquez, and Pedro Betancourt.{{sfn|Johnston Aguilar|2001|p=}}  On 18 July 1626, the Jesuit temple was inaugurated; along with the rest of the city, it suffered and was damaged by continuous earthquakes that struck the city between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries.{{sfn|Melchor Toledo|2011|p=62}}\n\nThe monks of San Juan de Dios founded their hospital and monastery in 1636 and thereafter were in charge of the hospitals in the Kingdom of Guatemala.  Their hospitals were: \n* San Alejo: for indigenous people\n* San Pedro: for ecclesiastical personnel\n* Santiago: for Spanish and mulattos \n* San L\u00e1zaro \n* San Juan de Dios: in 1667 the hospital of San Alejo was delivered to the Brothers of San Juan de Dios by the [[Order of Preachers|Dominicans]] who had managed it until then; in 1685, San Alejo and Santiago hospitals joined together, forming the Hospital San Juan de Dios.{{sfn|Melchor Toledo|2011|p=64}}\n\nThe temple of the Escuela de Cristo -School of Christ- was founded in the parish of Our Lady of Remedios in 1664 and from 1689 onward it was known as the Congregation of San Felipe de Neri.  Meanwhile, around 1690, the Jesuits founded another school: the \"San Francisco de Borja\" where the poet and priest Rafael Landivar, [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]], eventually would study and serve as principal.\n\nIn the seventeenth century there were two types of nuns: discalced and urban.{{sfn|Anchisi de Rodr\u00edguez|2014|p=24:35}}\n\n{| class=\"mw-collapsible wikitable\"  style=\"margin: 1em auto; width:70%; font-size:90%;\"\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n!style=\"background:#659ec7; width:15%;\"|Attribute\n!style=\"background:#659ec7;\" align=center|Discalced nuns\n!style=\"background:#659ec7;\" |Urban nuns\n|-\n!style=\"background:lemonchiffon;\"|Designation\n|Community life||Private life  \n|-\n!style=\"background:lemonchiffon;\"|Admission cost\n|None||Donation in goods or property to produce revenues for the congregation\n|-\n!style=\"background:lemonchiffon;\"|Lifestyle\n|Enclosed||Enclosed\n|-\n!style=\"background:lemonchiffon;\"|Prayer\n|In the chorus||In the chorus  \n|-\n!style=\"background:lemonchiffon;\"|Austerity rules\n|Strict: depended on tithing, silent at all times, except to pray and never drank chocolate.<ref group=Note>The chocolate was the drink of choice in Guatemala during the colonial era.

Upon arrival he suffered a serious illness, during which he had the first opportunity to be with the poor and dispossessed.  After his recovery he wanted to pursue ecclesiastical studies but unable to do so, professed as a Franciscan tertiary in the Convent of San Francisco in Santiago de los Caballeros. He founded shelters for the poor, indigenous, and homeless, and founded the Order of the Brothers of Our Lady of Bethlehem in 1656, to serve the poor.{{sfn|Esparza|n.d.|p=}} Santo Hermano Pedro wrote several books, including: Instruction De la Cruz's brother, Crown of the Passion of Jesus Christ our good or Rules Confraternity Betlemitas.  He is considered the great evangelist of the West Indies, just as San Francisco Javier is to the East Indies.  Brother Pedro attended to the poor, sick, orphaned, and dying, and was an early promoter of Human Rights. Additionally, he was the first literacy advocate in America, and the Order of Betlemitas in turn was the first religious order born in the Americas. The Santo Hermano Pedro was a man ahead of his time, both in his methods of teaching reading and writing to the illiterate and in medical patient treatment.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\n==== Royal and pontifical University of San Carlos Borromeo ====\n{{Main|University of San Carlos of Guatemala}}\n[[File:Antigua university courtyard.JPG|thumb|200px|[[University of San Carlos of Guatemala|Royal and Pontifical University of San Carlos Borromeo]]. Picture from 1971]]\n\n[[Francisco Marroqu\u00edn]], first bishop of Guatemala, sent the Spanish King a letter in 1548, asking for a superior education institution for [[Guatemala]], but the letter went unanswered. Towards the end of his life, in 1562, Marroqu\u00edn left some money in his will to establish a school -which eventually was the \"Santo Tom\u00e1s de Aquino school\"- where grammar, arts, philosophy, and theology would be taught. Poor Spanish children would be the beneficiaries of this pious work, as they could not travel to those cities where there were universities already, such as [[M\u00e9xico City]] in the [[New Spain]]. Historian John Tate Lanning said regarding this that, \"Marroqu\u00edn's testament is so famous, that many people who have not even laid eyes on it say that there are things in the document that are really not in it. Marroqu\u00edn never talks about a University, much less establishing one...\"{{sfn|Tate Lanning|1977|p=8}} On the other hand, there is indeed a document from Mayor Pedro Crespo Suarez, who left twenty thousand pesos after his death to set up classes in the University that \"was being asked of the crown\".{{sfn|Hern\u00e1ndez de Le\u00f3n|1928|p=}}\n\nThe [[Jesuits]] opposed a university establishment, given that they did not like the idea of having the other [[regular clergy]] orders -[[Mercedarians]], [[Franciscans]] and [[Order of Preachers]]- taking the initiative in religious and educational issues.{{sfn|Hern\u00e1ndez de Le\u00f3n|1928|p=}} In August 1655, the [[Church and Convent of Society of Jesus (Antigua Guatemala)|Society of Jesus]] had bought the whole lot from the D\u00edaz del Castillo family and by then, their San Lucas School was well known in the region and it even granted two university degrees.{{sfn|Agencia Espa\u00f1ola de Cooperaci\u00f3n Internacional para el Desarrollo|2008|p=8}} In 1653, the San Lucas School had a staff of only thirteen priests, a very small number compared to the size of the building; the Jesuits, however, made a major impact on the cultural and educational life in the [[Kingdom of Guatemala|Capitan\u00eda General of Guatemala]]. The school was the city's most prestigious, and from it graduated most of the elite members of society of the time. Most of its students were secular and went on to get the best positions in the country.{{sfn|Agencia Espa\u00f1ola de Cooperaci\u00f3n Internacional para el Desarrollo|2008|p=8}}\n\nAfter several decades, petitions, and lawsuits, king [[Charles II of Spain|Carlos II]] expedited a royal decree, on January 31, 1676, allowing [[Kingdom of Guatemala|Capitan\u00eda General of Guatemala]] to establish its university or \"General Study.\"<ref group=Note>During the Spanish colony, \"General Study\" was another name for the universities.</ref> After a lengthy and cumbersome organizational process that lasted five years, the university started classes on January 7, 1681, with more than sixty registered students under President Doctor Jos\u00e9 de Ba\u00f1os y Soto Mayor, Cathedral archdeacon, King of Spain preacher and Doctor from the University of Osuna.{{sfn|Hern\u00e1ndez de Le\u00f3n|1928|p=}} The university began its activities under the protection of Saint Carlos Borromeo, and its norms and regulations were copied from those of the M\u00e9xico University which, in turn, were adapted from those of the [[Universidad de Salamanca]] in Spain.\n\nThe first classes given in the university were:\n* Canonic law\n* Medicine\n* Scholastic theology\n* Moral theology\n* Languages\n\nThe Royal University of San Carlos Borromeo became pontifical via the [[Papal Bull]] of [[Pope Innocent XI]], issued and dated 18 June 1687.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\n=== 18th-century events ===\n\n==== San Miguel Earthquake====\n{{Main|1717 Guatemala earthquake}}\n[[File:Antigua, Guatemala.

At that time, the power of the [[Catholic Church]] over the Spanish Empire's citizens was absolute and any natural disaster was considered as divine punishment.  In the city, people also believed that the proximity of the [[Volc\u00e1n de Fuego]] (English: Volcano of Fire) was the cause of earthquakes; the great architect Diego de Porres even said that all the earthquakes were caused by volcano explosions.{{sfn|Melchor Toledo|2011|p=103}}\n\nOn August 27 there was a strong eruption of [[Volc\u00e1n de Fuego]], which lasted until August 30;  the residents of the city asked for help to Santo Cristo of the Cathedral and to the Virgen del Socorro who were sworn patrons of the [[Volcan de Fuego]].  On August 29, a Virgen del Rosario procession took to the streets after a century without leaving her temple, and there were many more holy processions until 29 September, the day of San Miguel.  Early afternoon earthquakes were minor, but at about 7:00&nbsp;p.m. there was a strong earthquake that forced residents to leave their homes; tremors and rumblings followed until four o'clock.  The neighbors took to the streets and loudly confessed their sins, bracing for the worst.<ref name=melchor104>{{harvnb|Melchor Toledo|2011|p=104}}</ref>\n\nThe San Miguel earthquake damaged the city considerably, to the point that some rooms and walls of the Royal Palace were destroyed.  There was also a partial abandonment of the city, food shortages, lack of manpower, and extensive damage to the city infrastructure, not to mention numerous dead and injured.<ref name=melchor104/> These earthquakes made the authorities consider moving to a new city less prone to seismic activity.  City residents strongly opposed the move, and even took to the Royal Palace in protest; in the end, the city did not move, but the number of troops of the Army Battalion required to maintain order was considerable.{{sfn|Rodr\u00edguez Gir\u00f3n|Flores|Garnica|1995|p=585}}  The damage to the palace were repaired by Diego de Porres, who finished repairs in 1720, although there are indications that there were additional work done by Porres until 1736.{{sfn|Rodr\u00edguez Gir\u00f3n|Flores|Garnica|1995|p=585}}\n\n==== San Casimiro earthquake ====\nOn March 4, 1751, the [[1751 Guatemala earthquake|San Casimiro earthquake]] destroyed the city of Santiago de Guatemala once more.  The church roof of the [[Church and Convent of the Society of Jesus (Antigua Guatemala)|Society of Jesus complex]] fell to the ground, forcing the Jesuits once again to ask for help from the parishioners to rebuild.  Once again, the building was among the most beautiful in the city when the repairs were completed.{{sfn|Agencia Espa\u00f1ola de Cooperaci\u00f3n Internacional para el Desarrollo|2008|p=9}} In fact, a period of prosperity began after the San Casimiro earthquake, as the city saw major improvements such as street embellishment and the introduction of a tap water system.  A new City Hall was built, and on July 17, 1753, work on the Jesuit plaza in front of the church was finished.{{sfn|Agencia Espa\u00f1ola de Cooperaci\u00f3n Internacional para el Desarrollo|2008|p=9}}\n\n==== Santa Marta earthquake ====\n{{Main|Santa Marta earthquake}}\n{{multiple image |align=right |direction=vertical |width=200px\n |image1=Patiodelosjesuitas.jpg |caption1=Ruins of the [[Church and Convent of Society of Jesus (Antigua Guatemala)|Society of Jesus]] school yard in 1880\n |image2=Interiordelosjesuitas.jpg |caption2=Ruins of the [[Church and Convent of Society of Jesus (Antigua Guatemala)|Society of Jesus]] church interior in 1880\n}}\n\nOn 12 June 1773 Captain General [[Mart\u00edn de Mayorga]] was inaugurated, and alongside Cort\u00e9s y Larr\u00e1z and the [[regular clergy]] vicars, were the top authorities in the Kingdom of Guatemala and would be the main characters in the events that followed the 1773 earthquakes.{{sfn|Melchor Toledo|2011|p=117}}\n\nIn 1773, the [[Santa Marta earthquake]]s destroyed much of the town, which led to the third change in location for the city.{{sfn|Foster|2000|p=}} The [[Spanish monarchy|Spanish Crown]] ordered, in 1776, the removal of the capital to a safer location, the Valley of the Shrine, where [[Guatemala City]], the modern capital of Guatemala, now stands. This new city did not retain its old name and was christened Nueva Guatemala de la Asunci\u00f3n (New Guatemala of the Assumption), and its patron saint is Our Lady of the Assumption. The badly damaged city of Santiago de los Caballeros was ordered abandoned, although not everyone left, and was thereafter referred to as la Antigua Guatemala (the Old Guatemala).{{sfn|Foster|2000|p=}}\n\nThe Santa Marta earthquake practically demolished the church and sections of the convent of the Society of Jesus.  Its cloisters and towers were in ruins, the walls were at dangerous angles, and the \"Casa de Ejercicios\" was turned into rubble. By a Royal decree of July 21, 1775, the city move to the \"Virgin valley\" was authorized.  This was a final order that had to be obeyed by all the people, who started to move slowly, starting on December of that year. In order to build the new city it was necessary to get construction material from the old abandoned churches in Santiago de Guatemala.  However, in the case of the Society of Jesus church, there was strong opposition from the neighbors to any possible dismantling of the structure since they considered that it could still be repaired.{{sfn|Agencia Espa\u00f1ola de Cooperaci\u00f3n Internacional para el Desarrollo|2008|p=11}}\n\n=== 19th-century events ===\n\n==== After the capital moved to La Ermita ====\n[[File:1887 Guatemala 1C Yv44.jpg|thumb|left|Postmark ANTIGUA CANCELADO in 1887, after Guatemala joined the UPU.

With respect to traffic, it was almost non-existent, aside from mule-pulled wagons\".{{sfn|Wilhelm of Sweden|1922|p=177}}\n\nAfter passing Mixco, the road proceeded more steeply upward, with a precipitous drop on one side and sheer cliff rising on the other; here and there a cross stood by the wayside, marking the spot where some traveler had died.  After reaching the highest point, they started down towards Antigua.  The city was in sight when a person in uniform planted himself in front of the car; it turned out to be the city commandant, along with six soldiers with wooden guns.{{sfn|Wilhelm of Sweden|1922|p=178}} Compared to Guatemala City at the time, Antigua was quite nicely kept, although all the churches were equally dilapidated and left entirely to themselves, as rebuilding since 1773 was confined to the strictly necessary. For the most part, only blank walls and shattered domes remained to greet the visitor by 1920,{{sfn|Wilhelm of Sweden|1922|p=179}} and some of the churches were in pitiful conditions.  In Santa Clara, for example, a mule was grazing, and in the Church of Grace a native family had taken up its quarters, along with their varied collection of domestic animals.{{sfn|Wilhelm of Sweden|1922|p=180}}\n\nBut there were other monuments in decent shape: \n* The Escuela de Cristo was one of the best preserved churches and was united with a convent that was still standing.  The priest that received the Prince and his three companions told them that all the silver and gold from the church had already been sold by his predecessors, so that he, to his extreme regret, was unable to sell any to them.{{sfn|Wilhelm of Sweden|1922|p=180}}\n* The old [[Church and Convent of Capuchins|Capuchin]] monastery with its many underground passages from the monks' cells to those of the nuns was worth a visit, especially one part where the cells were built in a circle surrounding a central common chamber.{{sfn|Wilhelm of Sweden|1922|p=180}}\n\n== Antigua Guatemala in the 21st century ==\n[[File:Guatemala 176.jpg|thumb|[[Antigua Guatemala Cathedral|San Jos\u00e9 Parish]] in the former Metropolitan Cathedral of Santiago.]]\n\nCentral Park \u2013 Parque Central \u2013 is the heart of the city, with the reconstructed fountain there acting as a popular gathering spot. To the north of the Central Park is the Arco de Santa Catalina, one of the most recognizable architectural landmarks of Antigua.\n\nLa Antigua is noted for its very elaborate religious celebrations during [[Lent]] ([[Cuaresma]]), leading up to [[Holy Week]] (''Semana Santa'') and [[Easter]] (''Pascua''). Each Sunday during Lent, one of the local [[parish]]es sponsors a [[Procession]] through the streets of Antigua. Elaborate and artistic carpets, predominantly made of dyed sawdust, flowers, pine needles, and even fruits and vegetables, adorn the processions' paths. {{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nDue to its popularity among tourists and its very well-developed tourism infrastructure, Antigua Guatemala is often used as a central location from which to visit other tourist areas in Guatemala and Central America. Cruise ships that dock at Guatemalan ports offer trips to Antigua from both the Pacific and Atlantic. Antigua also holds a sizeable retirement community of expatriates from the US and Europe. {{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Economy==\nHistorically, the area was considered to be one of the finest agriculturally in Guatemala.{{sfn|Baily|1850|p=78}} Tourism is the main driver of the economy.

There are many Spanish language schools in Antigua, and it is one of the most popular and best recognized centers for Spanish language study by students from Europe, Asia, and North America. Language institutes are one of the primary industries of Antigua, along with tourism.\n\n==Sports==\n[[Antigua GFC]] football club plays in the Guatemalan top division. Their home stadium is the [[Estadio Pensativo]], which has a capacity of 9,000. They are nicknamed ''Los panzas verdes'' (\"Green bellies\") and have been successful nationally, having won the title four times since 2015.\n\n==Cuisine==\nThere are many restaurants in Antigua. Small eateries can be found at the Antigua marketplace next to the central bus stop, where you will find traditional Guatemalan dishes such as the traditional/[[Guatemala|Chapin]] breakfast, for example: refried beans, fried egg, fried plantain, and fresh cheese, served with handmade [[tortillas]].

The most commanding, to the south of the city, is the [[Volc\u00e1n de Agua]] or \"Volcano of Water\", some {{convert|3766|m}} high. When the Spanish arrived, the inhabitants of the area, [[Kaqchikel people|Kakchikel Mayas]], called it Hunap\u00fa (and they still do). However, it became known as Volc\u00e1n de Agua after a [[lahar]] from the volcano buried the second site of the capital, which prompted the Spanish authorities to move the capital to present-day Antigua. The original site of the second capital is now the village [[San Miguel Escobar]].\n\nTo the west of the city are a pair of peaks, [[Acatenango]], which last erupted in 1972, some {{convert|3976|m}} high, and the [[Volc\u00e1n de Fuego]] or \"Volcano of Fire\", some {{convert|3763|m}} high. \"Fuego\" is famous for being almost constantly active at a low level. Steam and gas issue from its top almost daily, while a larger eruption occurred in September 2012.\n\n==Tourism==\n{{See also|La Aurora International Airport}}\n\nAntigua is a growing tourist destination in Guatemala as it is close to [[Guatemala City]] but is much calmer and safer, with more tourist oriented activities.  It is possible to take buses from Antigua to many parts of Guatemala.  Many travel agencies offer shuttles to the main tourist places: Monterrico beach, [[Atitlan Lake]], Coban, [[Lanqu\u00edn]] (Semuc Champey), or [[Tikal]], though the transportation is more central in Guatemala City.

After the [[Santa Marta earthquake]], although the convent was not completely affected, its assets were transferred to the new Guatemala de la Asunci\u00f3n by order of the Captain General.\n|-\n!style=\"background:lemonchiffon;\"|[[La Recolecci\u00f3n Architectural Complex|La Recolecci\u00f3n]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |[[File:LaRecoleccion.Antigua.jpg|150px]]\n|In 1685 two \"Recoleto\" missionaries came to the city of Santiago de los Caballeros, and when some more monks of their order arrived in the following years, asked permission of the City Hall<ref group=Note>i.e., Local authorities chosen among the [[criollo people]].</ref> to build a monastery; but in 1695, the City Hall made it known that there was insufficient reason to justify the construction because there were already enough monasteries in the city.

Since its beginning, it has suffered seismic damage: in 1565 the first building was severely damaged and the tremors continued until 1773. After being abandoned for almost two hundred years, the church was rebuilt between 1961 and 1967 when the [[Franciscans]] recovered the property, and it has been open for Catholic worship since. The facade of the church is adorned with baroque columns and two bell towers. Adjacent to the church are the ruins of the old Franciscan convent. The temple has a special chapel that houses the remains of Saint Hermano Pedro de San Jos\u00e9 de Betancur, a missionary from the Canary Islands. \n|-\n!style=\"background:lemonchiffon;\"|[[La Merced Church, Antigua Guatemala|La Merced Church]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[File:La_merced_antigua_guatemala_2009d.JPG|150px]]\n|Architect Juan de Dios Estrada was in charge of its construction, which began in 1749.

Originally it consisted of three cloisters and a temple, and eventually hosted up to twelve Jesuits. It worked as \"Colegio de San Lucas of the Society of Jesus\" from 1608 until the order was expelled in 1767: \"The school became famous and was unrivaled in terms of teaching of literature and grammar; it served the elite of Santiago de los Caballeros society, and among its students were chroniclers Francisco Antonio Fuentes y Guzm\u00e1n and Francisco V\u00e1zquez, and priests Pedro Betancourt and Rafael Land\u00edvar.\"{{sfn|Johnston Aguilar|2001|p=}} The structure remained in relatively good condition after the 1773 earthquake, but it was eventually destroyed by the 1917\u201318 and 1976 earthquakes.\n|-\n!style=\"background:lemonchiffon;\"|[[Santo Domingo Monastery]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[File:GT056-Antigua Domingo5.jpeg|150px]]\n|Originally one of the most important and largest in the city, the Convent of Santo Domingo was destroyed in 1773 and abandoned by the transfer of the Dominicans to their site in Guatemala City . The ruins were sold to individuals and converted into the Hotel Casa Santo Domingo in 1989. In 2013 the 43rd General Assembly of the Organization of American States was held at their facilities. \n|-\n!style=\"background:lemonchiffon;\"|[[Escuela de Cristo Church]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[File:Escueladecristo01.jpg|150px]]\n|The temple was founded in the parish of the Holy Cross in 1664 and from 1689 it was known as the \"Congregation of San Felipe de Neri\". Due to the earthquakes in San Miguel in 1717 the building was damaged; the  reconstruction was finalized in 1730 under the leadership of Mayor Architect Diego de Porres. In 1784, it was moved to \"Our Lady of Remedies\" parish, when the clergy of this church moved to [[Guatemala City|Nueva Guatemala de la Asunci\u00f3n]]. The fa\u00e7ade has an architectural renaissance style and is made of stone, like the church of the Capuchins, a characteristic that distinguishes them from the other temples in the city.
