Imbault, carried out the detailed design and erection process of the bridge.<ref name=pl-jb /> Architects for the contractors were from the British firm [[John James Burnet|John Burnet & Partners]] of [[Glasgow]], Scotland.<ref name=\"glasgowsculpture\"/> Lawrence Ennis, of Dorman Long, served as Director of Construction and primary onsite supervisor throughout the entire build, alongside Edward Judge, Dorman Long's Chief Technical Engineer, who functioned as Consulting and Designing Engineer.\n\nThe building of the bridge coincided with the construction of a system of [[Sydney underground railways|underground railways]] in Sydney's CBD, known today as the [[City Circle]], and the bridge was designed with this in mind. The bridge was designed to carry six lanes of road traffic, flanked on each side by two railway tracks and a footpath. Both sets of rail tracks were linked into the underground [[Wynyard railway station, Sydney|Wynyard railway station]] on the south (city) side of the bridge by symmetrical ramps and tunnels. The eastern-side railway tracks were intended for use by a planned rail link to the [[Northern Beaches]];<ref>{{cite NSW HD|4800281|Wynyard Former Tram Tunnels|accessdate=12 April 2019}}</ref> in the interim they were used to carry [[Trams in Sydney|trams]] from the North Shore into a terminal within Wynyard station, and when tram services were discontinued in 1958, they were converted into extra traffic lanes. The [[Bradfield Highway, Sydney|Bradfield Highway]], which is the main roadway section of the bridge and its approaches, is named in honour of Bradfield's contribution to the bridge.\n\n===Construction===\n[[File:Aerial view of Sydney Harbour - the bridge is under construction.jpg|thumb|Sydney Harbour Bridge under construction]]\n[[File:Early construction, Sydney Harbour Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|The arch being constructed]]\n[[File:Aerial view of Sydney and Circular Quay on the day of the official opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, 19 March, 1932 (6174053762).jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Sydney and Circular Quay on the day of the official opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, 19 March 1932]]\n[[File:HMAS Canberra sailing into Sydney Harbour in 1930.jpg|thumb|{{HMAS|Canberra|D33|6}} sailing under the completed arch from which the deck is being suspended in 1930]]\nBradfield visited the site sporadically throughout the eight years it took Dorman Long to complete the bridge. Despite having originally championed a cantilever construction and the fact that his own arched general design was used in neither the tender process nor as input to the detailed design specification (and was anyway a rough copy of the Devil's Gate bridge produced by the NSW Works Department), Bradfield subsequently attempted to claim personal credit for Dorman Long's design.  This led to a bitter argument, with Dorman Long maintaining that instructing other people to produce a copy of an existing design in a document not subsequently used to specify the final construction did not constitute personal design input on Bradfield's part. This friction ultimately led to a large contemporary brass plaque being bolted very tightly to the side of one of the granite columns of the bridge in order to makes things clear <ref>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Sydney_Harbour_Bridge_plaque.jpg.</ref>\n\nThe official ceremony to mark the \"turning of the first sod\" occurred on 28 July 1923, on the spot at Milsons Point on the north shore where two workshops to assist in building the bridge were to be constructed.<ref name=\"bos-time\">{{cite web|title=Six million rivets: The timeline|url=http://sydney-harbour-bridge.bos.nsw.edu.au/building-the-bridge/rivets.php|work=Sydney Harbour Bridge|publisher=NSW Government: Board of Studies|access-date=26 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221151649/http://sydney-harbour-bridge.bos.nsw.edu.au/building-the-bridge/rivets.php|archive-date=21 February 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>North Shore Bridge ''[[Railway Gazette International|Railway Gazette]]'' 5 October 1923 page 417</ref>\n\nAn estimated 469 buildings on the north shore, both private homes and commercial operations, were demolished to allow construction to proceed, with little or no compensation being paid. Work on the bridge itself commenced with the construction of approaches and approach spans, and by September 1926 concrete piers to support the approach spans were in place on each side of the harbour.<ref name=\"bos-time\" />\n\nAs construction of the approaches took place, work was also started on preparing the [[Foundation (engineering)|foundations]] required to support the enormous weight of the arch and loadings. Concrete and granite faced [[Abutment|abutment towers]] were constructed, with the angled foundations built into their sides.<ref name=\"bos-time\" />\n\nOnce work had progressed sufficiently on the support structures, a giant [[Crane (machine)|\"creeper crane\"]] was erected on each side of the harbour.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nicholson|first=John|title=Building the Sydney Harbour Bridge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1DXydVvXi4EC|format=Google books|access-date=10 December 2009|year=2001|publisher=Allen & Unwin|isbn=978-1-86508-258-5|page=14|quote=There was one creeper crane on each side of the harbour.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101135121/https://books.google.com/books?id=1DXydVvXi4EC|archive-date=1 January 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> These cranes were fitted with a cradle, and then used to hoist men and materials into position to allow for erection of the steelwork. To stabilise works while building the arches, tunnels were excavated on each shore with [[Wire rope|steel cables]] passed through them and then fixed to the upper sections of each half-arch to stop them collapsing as they extended outwards.<ref name=\"bos-time\" />\n\nArch construction itself began on 26 October 1928. The southern end of the bridge was worked on ahead of the northern end, to detect any errors and to help with alignment. The cranes would \"creep\" along the arches as they were constructed, eventually meeting up in the middle. In less than two years, on Tuesday, 19 August 1930, the two halves of the arch touched for the first time. Workers riveted both top and bottom sections of the arch together, and the arch became self-supporting, allowing the support cables to be removed. On 20 August 1930 the joining of the arches was celebrated by flying the flags of [[Flag of Australia|Australia]] and the [[Flag of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] from the jibs of the creeper cranes.<ref name=\"bos-time\"/><ref>The Sydney Harbour Bridge ''Railway Gazette'' 18 March 1932 page 433</ref>\n\n[[File:The bridge in curve 1926.jpg|thumb|left|[[Grace Cossington Smith]]'s painting of the arch under construction.]]\n[[File:JJC Bradfield Sydney Harbour Bridge 1932.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Bradfield (engineer)|John Bradfield]] riding the first test train across the bridge on 19 January 1932]]\nOnce the arch was completed, the creeper cranes were then worked back down the arches, allowing the roadway and other parts of the bridge to be constructed from the centre out. The vertical [[Tie (engineering)|hangers]] were attached to the arch, and these were then joined with horizontal crossbeams. The deck for the roadway and railway were built on top of the crossbeams, with the deck itself being completed by June 1931, and the creeper cranes were dismantled.

Drivers on the northern side will find themselves on the [[Warringah Freeway]], though it is easy to turn off the freeway to drive westwards into [[North Sydney, New South Wales|North Sydney]] or eastwards to Neutral Bay and beyond upon arrival on the northern side.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}\n\nThe bridge originally only had four wider traffic lanes occupying the central space which now has six, as photos taken soon after the opening clearly show. In 1958 tram services across the bridge were withdrawn and the tracks replaced by two extra road lanes; these lanes are now the leftmost southbound lanes on the bridge and are still clearly distinguishable from the other six road lanes. Lanes 7 and 8 now connect the bridge to the elevated Cahill Expressway that carries traffic to the Eastern Distributor.\n\nIn 1988, work began to build a tunnel to complement the bridge. It was determined that the bridge could no longer support the increased traffic flow of the 1980s. The [[Sydney Harbour Tunnel]] was completed in August 1992 and carries only motor vehicles.\n\nThe Bradfield Highway is designated as a [[Stock route|Travelling Stock Route]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wilderness.org.au/articles/nsw-drovers-rally-to-save-historic-travelling|publisher=The Wilderness Society|title=NSW drovers rally to save historic travelling stock routes|access-date=5 July 2009|date=27 August 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222021821/http://www.wilderness.org.au/campaigns/wildcountry/nsw-drovers-rally-to-save-historic-travelling|archive-date=22 February 2012}}</ref> which means that it is permissible to herd livestock across the bridge, but only between midnight and dawn, and after giving notice of intention to do so.

Lanes three, four and five are reversible. One and two always flow north. Six, seven, and eight always flow south. The default is four each way. For the morning rush hour, the lane changes on the bridge also require changes to the [[Warringah Freeway]], with its inner western reversible carriageway directing traffic to the bridge lane numbers three and four southbound.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}\n\nThe bridge has a series of overhead gantries which indicate the direction of flow for each traffic lane. A green arrow pointing down to a traffic lane means the lane is open. A flashing red \"X\" indicates the lane is closing, but is not yet in use for traffic travelling in the other direction. A static red \"X\" means the lane is in use for oncoming traffic. This arrangement was introduced in the 1990s, replacing a slow operation where lane markers were manually moved to mark the centre median.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}\n\nIt is possible to see odd arrangements of flow during night periods when maintenance occurs, which may involve completely closing some lanes. Normally this is done between midnight and dawn, because of the enormous traffic demands placed on the bridge outside these hours.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}\n\nWhen the Sydney Harbour Tunnel opened in August 1992, Lane 7 became a [[bus lane]].<ref>Harbour Bridge Public Transport Lane ''[[Fleetline (periodical)|Fleetline]]'' issue 198 January 1992 page 13</ref><ref>Opening of Sydney Harbour Tunnel & Gore Hill Freeway ''[[Australian Bus Panorama]]'' issue 8/3 October 1992 page 38</ref>\n\n===Tolls===\n[[File:Sydney Harbour Bridge toll gates, 1933.jpg|thumb|Northbound view of toll gates, 1933]]\nThe vehicular traffic lanes on the bridge are operated as a [[toll road]]. As of October 2019, there is a variable tolling system for all vehicles headed into the CBD (southbound).

The toll varies from a minimum value of $2.50 to a maximum value of $4.<ref>[https://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/sydney-motorways/documents/sydney-motorways-toll-charges.pdf Sydney Motorway Toll Charges ] Transport for NSW 1 October 2019</ref>  There is no toll for northbound traffic (though taxis travelling north may charge passengers the toll in anticipation of the toll the taxi must pay on the return journey).

This was paid off in 1988, but the toll has been kept (indeed increased) to recoup the costs of the [[Sydney Harbour Tunnel]].<ref>[https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/opinion/dont-we-own-the-bridge-yet/news-story/470a79a8df85451a62546f1ee5a43a1f?sv=9d46fd6e74ef2ce70a1cf9189001bdf4 Don't we own the Bridge yet?] ''[[Daily Telegraph (Australia)|Daily Telegraph]]'' 15 June 2009</ref>\n\nAfter the decision to build the Sydney Harbour Tunnel was made in the early 1980s, the toll was increased (from 20 cents to $1, then to $1.50, and finally to $2 by the time the tunnel opened) to pay for its construction. The tunnel also had an initial toll of $2 southbound. After the increase to $1, the concrete barrier on the bridge separating the Bradfield Highway from the Cahill Expressway was increased in height, because of the large numbers of drivers crossing it illegally from lane 6 to 7, to avoid the toll. The toll for all southbound vehicles was increased to $3 in March 2004.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}\n\nOriginally it cost a car or motorcycle six pence to cross, a horse and rider being three pence. Use of the bridge by bicycle riders (provided that they use the cycleway) and by pedestrians is free. Later governments capped the fee for motorcycles at one-quarter of the passenger-vehicle cost, but now it is again the same as the cost for a passenger vehicle, although quarterly flat-fee passes are available which are much cheaper for frequent users.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Motorcyclists|url = https://www.myrta.com/wps/portal/extvp/myrta/etoll/motorcyclists/!ut/p/b1/dcrdEkJAGIDha-kK9ls_LYdGFIuIbwcnxmjGSPkpKl19uoDO3nfmITnJVCYz0DWVkZTkXfls6nJq-q68_j7fFnCwQoESo0ehATgnxeWyRNeSSbYC9hcYlCQkBaWIL9DPXDc-4BQ-N9vhYTsUd9gnIPPF1GZMUucev8ZYRDQOcFqqwsUEe-4PIUeYG9SmpX273tnzuN8FUOlU2JFlhMOYUtyQW76vv8TAB_4!/|website = www.myrta.com|access-date = 12 June 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150614025012/https://www.myrta.com/wps/portal/extvp/myrta/etoll/motorcyclists/!ut/p/b1/dcrdEkJAGIDha-kK9ls_LYdGFIuIbwcnxmjGSPkpKl19uoDO3nfmITnJVCYz0DWVkZTkXfls6nJq-q68_j7fFnCwQoESo0ehATgnxeWyRNeSSbYC9hcYlCQkBaWIL9DPXDc-4BQ-N9vhYTsUd9gnIPPF1GZMUucev8ZYRDQOcFqqwsUEe-4PIUeYG9SmpX273tnzuN8FUOlU2JFlhMOYUtyQW76vv8TAB_4!/|archive-date = 14 June 2015|url-status = live|df = dmy-all}}</ref> Originally there were six toll booths at the southern end of the bridge, these were replaced by 16 booths in 1950.<ref>Sydney Harbour Bridge ''[[Truck & Bus Transportation]]'' March 1950 page 9</ref> The toll was charged in both directions until 4 July 1970 when changed to only be applied to southbound traffic.<ref>Reaching the North ''[[Trolley Wire]]'' issue 200 June 1982 page 23</ref>\n\nIn July 2008 a new electronic tolling system called [[e-TAG]] was introduced.

The highlight was the biggest parade of sail ever held in Sydney, square-riggers from all over the world, surrounded by hundreds of smaller craft of every description, passing majestically under the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The day's festivities culminated in a fireworks display in which the bridge was the focal point of the finale, with fireworks streaming from the arch and roadway.

Bright yellow souvenir caps were distributed to walkers. A series of speakers placed at intervals along the bridge formed a [[sound installation]]. Each group of speakers broadcast sound and music from a particular era (e.g. [[King Edward VIII]]'s abdication speech; [[Gough Whitlam]]'s speech at [[Old Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] in [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|1975]]), the overall effect being that the soundscape would \"flow\" through history as walkers proceeded along the bridge.

Imbault, carried out the detailed design and erection process of the bridge.<ref name=pl-jb /> Architects for the contractors were from the British firm [[John James Burnet|John Burnet & Partners]] of [[Glasgow]], Scotland.<ref name=\"glasgowsculpture\"/> Lawrence Ennis, of Dorman Long, served as Director of Construction and primary onsite supervisor throughout the entire build, alongside Edward Judge, Dorman Long's Chief Technical Engineer, who functioned as Consulting and Designing Engineer.\n\nThe building of the bridge coincided with the construction of a system of [[Sydney underground railways|underground railways]] in Sydney's CBD, known today as the [[City Circle]], and the bridge was designed with this in mind. The bridge was designed to carry six lanes of road traffic, flanked on each side by two railway tracks and a footpath. Both sets of rail tracks were linked into the underground [[Wynyard railway station, Sydney|Wynyard railway station]] on the south (city) side of the bridge by symmetrical ramps and tunnels. The eastern-side railway tracks were intended for use by a planned rail link to the [[Northern Beaches]];<ref>{{cite NSW HD|4800281|Wynyard Former Tram Tunnels|accessdate=12 April 2019}}</ref> in the interim they were used to carry [[Trams in Sydney|trams]] from the North Shore into a terminal within Wynyard station, and when tram services were discontinued in 1958, they were converted into extra traffic lanes. The [[Bradfield Highway, Sydney|Bradfield Highway]], which is the main roadway section of the bridge and its approaches, is named in honour of Bradfield's contribution to the bridge.\n\n===Construction===\n[[File:Aerial view of Sydney Harbour - the bridge is under construction.jpg|thumb|Sydney Harbour Bridge under construction]]\n[[File:Early construction, Sydney Harbour Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|The arch being constructed]]\n[[File:Aerial view of Sydney and Circular Quay on the day of the official opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, 19 March, 1932 (6174053762).jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Sydney and Circular Quay on the day of the official opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, 19 March 1932]]\n[[File:HMAS Canberra sailing into Sydney Harbour in 1930.jpg|thumb|{{HMAS|Canberra|D33|6}} sailing under the completed arch from which the deck is being suspended in 1930]]\nBradfield visited the site sporadically throughout the eight years it took Dorman Long to complete the bridge. Despite having originally championed a cantilever construction and the fact that his own arched general design was used in neither the tender process nor as input to the detailed design specification (and was anyway a rough copy of the Devil's Gate bridge produced by the NSW Works Department), Bradfield subsequently attempted to claim personal credit for Dorman Long's design.  This led to a bitter argument, with Dorman Long maintaining that instructing other people to produce a copy of an existing design in a document not subsequently used to specify the final construction did not constitute personal design input on Bradfield's part. This friction ultimately led to a large contemporary brass plaque being bolted very tightly to the side of one of the granite columns of the bridge in order to makes things clear <ref>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Sydney_Harbour_Bridge_plaque.jpg.</ref>\n\nThe official ceremony to mark the \"turning of the first sod\" occurred on 28 July 1923, on the spot at Milsons Point on the north shore where two workshops to assist in building the bridge were to be constructed.<ref name=\"bos-time\">{{cite web|title=Six million rivets: The timeline|url=http://sydney-harbour-bridge.bos.nsw.edu.au/building-the-bridge/rivets.php|work=Sydney Harbour Bridge|publisher=NSW Government: Board of Studies|access-date=26 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221151649/http://sydney-harbour-bridge.bos.nsw.edu.au/building-the-bridge/rivets.php|archive-date=21 February 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>North Shore Bridge ''[[Railway Gazette International|Railway Gazette]]'' 5 October 1923 page 417</ref>\n\nAn estimated 469 buildings on the north shore, both private homes and commercial operations, were demolished to allow construction to proceed, with little or no compensation being paid. Work on the bridge itself commenced with the construction of approaches and approach spans, and by September 1926 concrete piers to support the approach spans were in place on each side of the harbour.<ref name=\"bos-time\" />\n\nAs construction of the approaches took place, work was also started on preparing the [[Foundation (engineering)|foundations]] required to support the enormous weight of the arch and loadings. Concrete and granite faced [[Abutment|abutment towers]] were constructed, with the angled foundations built into their sides.<ref name=\"bos-time\" />\n\nOnce work had progressed sufficiently on the support structures, a giant [[Crane (machine)|\"creeper crane\"]] was erected on each side of the harbour.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nicholson|first=John|title=Building the Sydney Harbour Bridge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1DXydVvXi4EC|format=Google books|access-date=10 December 2009|year=2001|publisher=Allen & Unwin|isbn=978-1-86508-258-5|page=14|quote=There was one creeper crane on each side of the harbour.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101135121/https://books.google.com/books?id=1DXydVvXi4EC|archive-date=1 January 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> These cranes were fitted with a cradle, and then used to hoist men and materials into position to allow for erection of the steelwork. To stabilise works while building the arches, tunnels were excavated on each shore with [[Wire rope|steel cables]] passed through them and then fixed to the upper sections of each half-arch to stop them collapsing as they extended outwards.<ref name=\"bos-time\" />\n\nArch construction itself began on 26 October 1928. The southern end of the bridge was worked on ahead of the northern end, to detect any errors and to help with alignment. The cranes would \"creep\" along the arches as they were constructed, eventually meeting up in the middle. In less than two years, on Tuesday, 19 August 1930, the two halves of the arch touched for the first time. Workers riveted both top and bottom sections of the arch together, and the arch became self-supporting, allowing the support cables to be removed. On 20 August 1930 the joining of the arches was celebrated by flying the flags of [[Flag of Australia|Australia]] and the [[Flag of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] from the jibs of the creeper cranes.<ref name=\"bos-time\"/><ref>The Sydney Harbour Bridge ''Railway Gazette'' 18 March 1932 page 433</ref>\n\n[[File:The bridge in curve 1926.jpg|thumb|left|[[Grace Cossington Smith]]'s painting of the arch under construction.]]\n[[File:JJC Bradfield Sydney Harbour Bridge 1932.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Bradfield (engineer)|John Bradfield]] riding the first test train across the bridge on 19 January 1932]]\nOnce the arch was completed, the creeper cranes were then worked back down the arches, allowing the roadway and other parts of the bridge to be constructed from the centre out. The vertical [[Tie (engineering)|hangers]] were attached to the arch, and these were then joined with horizontal crossbeams. The deck for the roadway and railway were built on top of the crossbeams, with the deck itself being completed by June 1931, and the creeper cranes were dismantled.

Lanes three, four and five are reversible. One and two always flow north. Six, seven, and eight always flow south. The default is four each way. For the morning rush hour, the lane changes on the bridge also require changes to the [[Warringah Freeway]], with its inner western reversible carriageway directing traffic to the bridge lane numbers three and four southbound.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}\n\nThe bridge has a series of overhead gantries which indicate the direction of flow for each traffic lane. A green arrow pointing down to a traffic lane means the lane is open. A flashing red \"X\" indicates the lane is closing, but is not yet in use for traffic travelling in the other direction. A static red \"X\" means the lane is in use for oncoming traffic. This arrangement was introduced in the 1990s, replacing a slow operation where lane markers were manually moved to mark the centre median.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}\n\nIt is possible to see odd arrangements of flow during night periods when maintenance occurs, which may involve completely closing some lanes. Normally this is done between midnight and dawn, because of the enormous traffic demands placed on the bridge outside these hours.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}\n\nWhen the Sydney Harbour Tunnel opened in August 1992, Lane 7 became a [[bus lane]].<ref>Harbour Bridge Public Transport Lane ''[[Fleetline (periodical)|Fleetline]]'' issue 198 January 1992 page 13</ref><ref>Opening of Sydney Harbour Tunnel & Gore Hill Freeway ''[[Australian Bus Panorama]]'' issue 8/3 October 1992 page 38</ref>\n\n===Tolls===\n[[File:Sydney Harbour Bridge toll gates, 1933.jpg|thumb|Northbound view of toll gates, 1933]]\nThe vehicular traffic lanes on the bridge are operated as a [[toll road]]. As of October 2019, there is a variable tolling system for all vehicles headed into the CBD (southbound). The toll paid is dependent on the time of day in which the vehicle passes through the toll plaza. The toll varies from a minimum value of $2.50 to a maximum value of $4.<ref>[https://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/sydney-motorways/documents/sydney-motorways-toll-charges.pdf Sydney Motorway Toll Charges ] Transport for NSW 1 October 2019</ref>  There is no toll for northbound traffic (though taxis travelling north may charge passengers the toll in anticipation of the toll the taxi must pay on the return journey).

This was paid off in 1988, but the toll has been kept (indeed increased) to recoup the costs of the [[Sydney Harbour Tunnel]].<ref>[https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/opinion/dont-we-own-the-bridge-yet/news-story/470a79a8df85451a62546f1ee5a43a1f?sv=9d46fd6e74ef2ce70a1cf9189001bdf4 Don't we own the Bridge yet?] ''[[Daily Telegraph (Australia)|Daily Telegraph]]'' 15 June 2009</ref>\n\nAfter the decision to build the Sydney Harbour Tunnel was made in the early 1980s, the toll was increased (from 20 cents to $1, then to $1.50, and finally to $2 by the time the tunnel opened) to pay for its construction. The tunnel also had an initial toll of $2 southbound. After the increase to $1, the concrete barrier on the bridge separating the Bradfield Highway from the Cahill Expressway was increased in height, because of the large numbers of drivers crossing it illegally from lane 6 to 7, to avoid the toll. The toll for all southbound vehicles was increased to $3 in March 2004.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}\n\nOriginally it cost a car or motorcycle six pence to cross, a horse and rider being three pence. Use of the bridge by bicycle riders (provided that they use the cycleway) and by pedestrians is free. Later governments capped the fee for motorcycles at one-quarter of the passenger-vehicle cost, but now it is again the same as the cost for a passenger vehicle, although quarterly flat-fee passes are available which are much cheaper for frequent users.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Motorcyclists|url = https://www.myrta.com/wps/portal/extvp/myrta/etoll/motorcyclists/!ut/p/b1/dcrdEkJAGIDha-kK9ls_LYdGFIuIbwcnxmjGSPkpKl19uoDO3nfmITnJVCYz0DWVkZTkXfls6nJq-q68_j7fFnCwQoESo0ehATgnxeWyRNeSSbYC9hcYlCQkBaWIL9DPXDc-4BQ-N9vhYTsUd9gnIPPF1GZMUucev8ZYRDQOcFqqwsUEe-4PIUeYG9SmpX273tnzuN8FUOlU2JFlhMOYUtyQW76vv8TAB_4!/|website = www.myrta.com|access-date = 12 June 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150614025012/https://www.myrta.com/wps/portal/extvp/myrta/etoll/motorcyclists/!ut/p/b1/dcrdEkJAGIDha-kK9ls_LYdGFIuIbwcnxmjGSPkpKl19uoDO3nfmITnJVCYz0DWVkZTkXfls6nJq-q68_j7fFnCwQoESo0ehATgnxeWyRNeSSbYC9hcYlCQkBaWIL9DPXDc-4BQ-N9vhYTsUd9gnIPPF1GZMUucev8ZYRDQOcFqqwsUEe-4PIUeYG9SmpX273tnzuN8FUOlU2JFlhMOYUtyQW76vv8TAB_4!/|archive-date = 14 June 2015|url-status = live|df = dmy-all}}</ref> Originally there were six toll booths at the southern end of the bridge, these were replaced by 16 booths in 1950.<ref>Sydney Harbour Bridge ''[[Truck & Bus Transportation]]'' March 1950 page 9</ref> The toll was charged in both directions until 4 July 1970 when changed to only be applied to southbound traffic.<ref>Reaching the North ''[[Trolley Wire]]'' issue 200 June 1982 page 23</ref>\n\nIn July 2008 a new electronic tolling system called [[e-TAG]] was introduced.

A light-show began after sunset and continued late into the night, the bridge being bathed in constantly changing, multi-coloured lighting, designed to highlight structural features of the bridge. In the evening the bright yellow caps were replaced by orange caps with a small, bright [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] attached.

Enke also led the Cats to the first four postseason appearances (3 N.I.T./1 NCAA) in school history and in 1950\u201351 competed in both the N.I.T. and NCAA postseason tournaments.

During the 1976 tournament he also logged Arizona's first and only tournament wins until Lute Olson's hiring, beating [[John Thompson (basketball)|John Thompson's]] [[1975\u201376 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team|Georgetown]] team 83\u201376.

In 1978, Coach Snowden helped transition the basketball program over to the newly formed Pac-10. Snowden could not sustain success in the Pac-10, however, finishing no higher than 4th place in the conference. His 9\u201318 final season led UA to look for a replacement.<ref name=\"Barker\" />\n\nKnown for his high-octane offense and remembered as a trailblazer, Fred \"The Fox\" Snowden brought excitement to Arizona basketball during his 10-year tenure as the program's head coach. Snowden, who led the Wildcats from 1972\u201382, was the first African-American head basketball coach at an NCAA Division I institution, amassing a 167\u2013108 mark. The 1973 Western Athletic Conference Coach of the Year, his career winning percentage of .607 has been topped by only three UA coaches since 1924. Nicknamed \"The Fox\" due to his cool demeanor, Snowden led Arizona to three postseason berths, including the 1975 National Commissioners\u2019 Invitational Tournament and the 1976 and 1977 NCAA Tournaments. His best season came in 1976, when the Wildcats went 24\u20139, won the Western Athletic Conference championship and advanced to the NCAA West Regional Final. The Brewton, Ala., native was the head coach who led Arizona into the Pac-10 in the 1978\u201379 season, guiding the program for its first four seasons in the Conference. Snowden also oversaw the transition into the McKale Center after its opening in 1973. He was inducted into the Arizona Sports Hall of Fame in 1988. Prior to his role at Arizona, Snowden was an assistant coach at Michigan. He also served on the coaching staff of his high school, Northwestern High School in Detroit, Mich., where he coached for five years after attending Wayne State University from 1954\u201358. Snowden died in 1994 at the age of 57.\n\nAthletic Director Dave Strack brought in [[Ben Lindsey (basketball)|Ben Lindsey]] to replace Fred Snowden in 1983, and on the surface, it seemed like a reasonable move. Lindsey had junior college expertise, having had a successful career at [[Grand Canyon University]], where he won two national titles.  What resulted, however, was nothing short of disaster. The 1983 team finished with the worst season in school history at 4\u201324, with only one Pac-10 win.<ref name=\"Barker\" />\n\n=== Lute Olson era ===\n\n==== Early years ====\nNewly hired UA Athletic director [[Cedric Dempsey]] fired Lindsey after only one season and hired [[Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball|University of Iowa]] coach Lute Olson as his successor.  UA needed a coach with a history of quickly turning around programs, which Olson had done previously at Iowa.  \"I knew we had a tremendous amount of work to do\", Olson recalled in a recent interview with Tucson Lifestyle.  \"The program was in shambles at that point, after the terrible year before...\"<ref name=\"Barker\" />\n\n[[File:Sean Elliott 1988 Arizona Basketball.JPG|thumb|right|300px|All-American Sean Elliott won several national college basketball awards and set the school's scoring record while helping lead the Wildcats to the Final Four in 1988.]]\nUnder Olson, Arizona quickly rose to national prominence. Arizona won its first Pac-10 title in 1986, only three years after his arrival.<ref name=\"Barker\" />  That season set up an amazing 1987\u201388 season, which included taking the [[Great Alaska Shootout]] championship, the Valley Bank Fiesta Bowl Classic championship and the Pac-10 championship.<ref name=\"Barker\" />  Under players [[Steve Kerr]], [[Kenny Lofton]] and [[Sean Elliott]], Arizona spent much of the season ranked No. 1 and made their first (and Olson's second) Final Four.<ref name=\"Barker\" />  While Arizona lost in the Final Four round, their play put the program on the map and launched Arizona's reign as a perennial Pac-10 and NCAA tournament contender. Sean Elliott was awarded the John R. Wooden Award on the season and would set the PAC-10 scoring record.<ref name=\"Barker\" />\n\nIn 1997, Arizona defeated the [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|University of Kentucky]], the defending national champions, to win the NCAA National Championship. Prior to winning the championship in 1997, Arizona stormed back from 10-point deficits in the Southeast Regional First Round and Second Round against #13 [[South Alabama Jaguars men's basketball|South Alabama]] and #12 [[College of Charleston Cougars men's basketball|College of Charleston]], respectively winning 65\u201357 and 73\u201369. The Southeast Regional Semifinal pitted against overall #1 Kansas (34\u20131) which had defeated Arizona the year before in the 1996 West Regional Semifinal. However, Arizona came out fast and stunned the [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Jayhawks]] 85\u201382, then prevailed in overtime against [[Providence Friars men's basketball|Providence]] 96\u201392 in the Elite Eight to clinch a berth in the Final Four. Arizona then beat #1 seed [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]] 66\u201358 in the Final Four, which turned out to be [[Dean Smith]]'s last game as a coach. Arizona also accomplished the unprecedented feat of beating three number one seeds in the 1997 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. This feat has never been accomplished by another team.\n\nThe year following the Championship season, 1998, Arizona returned all 5 starters ([[Mike Bibby]], [[Michael Dickerson]], [[Miles Simon]], [[Bennett Davison]], and [[A.

Lute Olson's wife Bobbi, well known to players and fans alike as a steadfast presence on the sidelines, lost her battle with cancer. The team, which had been a preseason pick by many to win the national title had to play without Olson for three weeks while Olson was on bereavement leave. The Cats vowed to dedicate their season to Bobbi. With guard [[Jason Gardner]], center [[Loren Woods]] and forward [[Michael Wright (basketball)|Michael Wright]] \u2014 each an All-American \u2014 leading the way, the Cats trounced their opponents, beating Oregon 104\u201365, devastating USC 105\u201361, and charging through the [[2001 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|Final Four]]. They took down Eastern Illinois, [[Butler Bulldogs men's basketball|Butler]], Mississippi, [[Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball|Illinois]], and [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]], only to be stopped by [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] in the title game. While being considered the favorite to win the title, which would have been Coach Olsen's 2nd and tied him with Coach [[Mike Krzyzewski]], his opponent, the Blue Devils claimed a ten-point victory in the game. This is the last game Coach Olsen ever coached in the Final Four and is considered by fans of the program to be his most bitter defeat. A championship would have vaulted him into hallowed ground among coaches, being one of few with multiple titles. Instead he remains tied with many coaches who have a single championship ring to their name. Meanwhile, his opponent in that game now is in second place among college coaches with five championship rings, behind only John Wooden's ten. All five of Krzyzewski's titles came in the 64 team field era; Wooden none. Still Coach Olsen earned the respect of his contemporary, Coach K said in the post game interview that \"Arizona had a great team and an amazing season and was worthy of winning the championship, lets give a hand to Coach Olsen and his team.\" The comment drew rousing applause from the audience in attendance and made Coach Olsen proud, even in defeat, to be honored as an equal by Coach Krzyzewski who many claim is the best coach in college history.\n\nIn his later years at UA, Olson fielded competitive teams with extremely talented point guards. Continuing the reputation and nickname \"Point Guard U,\"<ref name=\"Point Guard U\" /> recent standouts include [[Jason Gardner]], [[Salim Stoudamire]], [[Mustafa Shakur]], [[Jerryd Bayless]] and [[Nic Wise]]. Arizona would win Olson's last Pac-10 title during the 2004\u20132005 season under the spectacular play of seniors Salim Stoudamire and center [[Channing Frye]]. That team also made it to the Elite 8 and the verge of the Final Four before blowing a 15-point lead with four minutes to play and losing in overtime, 90\u201389, to the No. 1 seed and eventual national runner-up, [[Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball|University of Illinois]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=254000061 | title=Arizona 89, Illinois 90 | publisher=ESPN |date= |accessdate=2008-03-30 }}</ref>\n\nOlson took an unexplained leave of absence at the beginning of the 2007\u20132008 season.

[[The Pride of Arizona]] pep band and the [[Zona Zoo]].\n* Before every game, the band splits into four sections in the four sides of McKale Center. They play [[Bear Down]] Arizona in sequence before the band runs back to the student section in the north stands and plays all of Bear Down. The band also yells \"Hi fans!\" to the fans, who respond by yelling \"Hi band!\" and \"Hi Sean!\" to head coach [[Sean Miller]], who responds by waving to the band. The band also yells \"Hi Adia!\" to Arizona women's basketball coach [[Adia Barnes]].\n* While the opposing team's players are being introduced, the student section turns their backs to the court. As each player's name is announced, they will yell \"Sucks!\" In the interest of sportsmanship, though, the Athletic Department is attempting to phase this tradition out.\n* At the start of each half, the entire crowd will stand until the other team scores a point. The fans will also clap rhythmically with the band as it plays a four-note refrain repeatedly until the ball is tipped or inbounded.\n* During the first four minutes of each half, or until the first media timeout, the band and students have several chants.\n** Every time an opposing player dribbles, the yell is \"Boing!\"\n** Every time they pass, the yell is \"Pass!\"\n** Every time they try to shoot, the yell is \"Brick!\"\n* When an opposing player fouls an Arizona player, the band and students chant, while pointing at the opposing player, \"You! You! You! You! You! You! You! You! You! On you, that's who!\" If the foul occurs during a shot and the player makes the shot, the chant is instead \"Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! No no no no! No no no no! No no no no! No no no no! Don't touch me!\"\n* If an opposing player accrues four fouls during the game, they will chant \"Four!\" four times while waving four fingers. If a player fouls out, the band plays the beat from \"[[Another One Bites the Dust]]\", concluding with the band and students yelling \"Hey! We're gonna get you too!\"\n* When opposing players are attempting foul shots, besides attempting to distract the player, the band and students have several chants, but the only constant one is yelled if the player misses their first shot of a two-shot foul, in which case they yell \"Nice shot, buddy!\"\n* If Arizona is beating an opponent by a comfortable margin late in the game, the band and students will chant \"Go start the bus!\" repeatedly. If an opponent makes a big play, they will chant \"It just doesn't matter!\"\n* Since the 1980s, the \"Ooh Aah Man\" Joe Cavaleri has made appearances at McKale to pump up the crowd. He starts by spelling out \"A-R-I-Z-O-N-A!\" with his body as the crowd chants along. He then directs the crowd in chanting \"U of A!\", first by each side of the arena, then by the north and south sides and east and west sides simultaneously then by the whole arena. His routine usually involves pulling off his shirt and pants to reveal another Arizona shirt and shorts underneath. Unfortunately, Cavaleri was recently diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]] and has only made a few appearances during the 2010\u20132011 season.<ref>{{cite news |title=UCLA game thread |author=Pascoe, Bruce |url=http://azstarnet.com/sports/blogs/pascoe/article_bd03b9b2-2a80-11e0-a8c2-001cc4c03286.html |newspaper=Arizona Daily Star |date=27 January 2011 |accessdate=27 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=UA's top fan sidelined |author=Hansen, Greg |url=http://azstarnet.com/sports/basketball/college/wildcats/article_27582e03-9aab-5a35-9155-99e3b30b07d9.html |newspaper=Arizona Daily Star |date=23 December 2010 |accessdate=17 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube|id=y9atqBD-89M|title=Ooh Aah Man at McKale vs ASU 1/15/11}}</ref>\n* At the end of every home game (and every Arizona athletics event the band is present at) the band plays Arizona's alma mater, \"All Hail, Arizona!\" Students and fans link arms, sway as they sing and jump up and down while singing the last part of the song.\n* The team hosts an annual \"White Out\" game.

In 1978, Coach Snowden helped transition the basketball program over to the newly formed Pac-10. Snowden could not sustain success in the Pac-10, however, finishing no higher than 4th place in the conference. His 9\u201318 final season led UA to look for a replacement.<ref name=\"Barker\" />\n\nKnown for his high-octane offense and remembered as a trailblazer, Fred \"The Fox\" Snowden brought excitement to Arizona basketball during his 10-year tenure as the program's head coach. Snowden, who led the Wildcats from 1972\u201382, was the first African-American head basketball coach at an NCAA Division I institution, amassing a 167\u2013108 mark. The 1973 Western Athletic Conference Coach of the Year, his career winning percentage of .607 has been topped by only three UA coaches since 1924. Nicknamed \"The Fox\" due to his cool demeanor, Snowden led Arizona to three postseason berths, including the 1975 National Commissioners\u2019 Invitational Tournament and the 1976 and 1977 NCAA Tournaments. His best season came in 1976, when the Wildcats went 24\u20139, won the Western Athletic Conference championship and advanced to the NCAA West Regional Final. The Brewton, Ala., native was the head coach who led Arizona into the Pac-10 in the 1978\u201379 season, guiding the program for its first four seasons in the Conference. Snowden also oversaw the transition into the McKale Center after its opening in 1973. He was inducted into the Arizona Sports Hall of Fame in 1988. Prior to his role at Arizona, Snowden was an assistant coach at Michigan. He also served on the coaching staff of his high school, Northwestern High School in Detroit, Mich., where he coached for five years after attending Wayne State University from 1954\u201358. Snowden died in 1994 at the age of 57.\n\nAthletic Director Dave Strack brought in [[Ben Lindsey (basketball)|Ben Lindsey]] to replace Fred Snowden in 1983, and on the surface, it seemed like a reasonable move. Lindsey had junior college expertise, having had a successful career at [[Grand Canyon University]], where he won two national titles.  What resulted, however, was nothing short of disaster.

Sean Elliott was awarded the John R. Wooden Award on the season and would set the PAC-10 scoring record.<ref name=\"Barker\" />\n\nIn 1997, Arizona defeated the [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|University of Kentucky]], the defending national champions, to win the NCAA National Championship. Prior to winning the championship in 1997, Arizona stormed back from 10-point deficits in the Southeast Regional First Round and Second Round against #13 [[South Alabama Jaguars men's basketball|South Alabama]] and #12 [[College of Charleston Cougars men's basketball|College of Charleston]], respectively winning 65\u201357 and 73\u201369. The Southeast Regional Semifinal pitted against overall #1 Kansas (34\u20131) which had defeated Arizona the year before in the 1996 West Regional Semifinal. However, Arizona came out fast and stunned the [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Jayhawks]] 85\u201382, then prevailed in overtime against [[Providence Friars men's basketball|Providence]] 96\u201392 in the Elite Eight to clinch a berth in the Final Four. Arizona then beat #1 seed [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]] 66\u201358 in the Final Four, which turned out to be [[Dean Smith]]'s last game as a coach. Arizona also accomplished the unprecedented feat of beating three number one seeds in the 1997 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament.

Lute Olson's wife Bobbi, well known to players and fans alike as a steadfast presence on the sidelines, lost her battle with cancer. The team, which had been a preseason pick by many to win the national title had to play without Olson for three weeks while Olson was on bereavement leave. The Cats vowed to dedicate their season to Bobbi. With guard [[Jason Gardner]], center [[Loren Woods]] and forward [[Michael Wright (basketball)|Michael Wright]] \u2014 each an All-American \u2014 leading the way, the Cats trounced their opponents, beating Oregon 104\u201365, devastating USC 105\u201361, and charging through the [[2001 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|Final Four]]. They took down Eastern Illinois, [[Butler Bulldogs men's basketball|Butler]], Mississippi, [[Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball|Illinois]], and [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]], only to be stopped by [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] in the title game. While being considered the favorite to win the title, which would have been Coach Olsen's 2nd and tied him with Coach [[Mike Krzyzewski]], his opponent, the Blue Devils claimed a ten-point victory in the game. This is the last game Coach Olsen ever coached in the Final Four and is considered by fans of the program to be his most bitter defeat. A championship would have vaulted him into hallowed ground among coaches, being one of few with multiple titles. Instead he remains tied with many coaches who have a single championship ring to their name. Meanwhile, his opponent in that game now is in second place among college coaches with five championship rings, behind only John Wooden's ten. All five of Krzyzewski's titles came in the 64 team field era; Wooden none. Still Coach Olsen earned the respect of his contemporary, Coach K said in the post game interview that \"Arizona had a great team and an amazing season and was worthy of winning the championship, lets give a hand to Coach Olsen and his team.\" The comment drew rousing applause from the audience in attendance and made Coach Olsen proud, even in defeat, to be honored as an equal by Coach Krzyzewski who many claim is the best coach in college history.\n\nIn his later years at UA, Olson fielded competitive teams with extremely talented point guards. Continuing the reputation and nickname \"Point Guard U,\"<ref name=\"Point Guard U\" /> recent standouts include [[Jason Gardner]], [[Salim Stoudamire]], [[Mustafa Shakur]], [[Jerryd Bayless]] and [[Nic Wise]]. Arizona would win Olson's last Pac-10 title during the 2004\u20132005 season under the spectacular play of seniors Salim Stoudamire and center [[Channing Frye]]. That team also made it to the Elite 8 and the verge of the Final Four before blowing a 15-point lead with four minutes to play and losing in overtime, 90\u201389, to the No. 1 seed and eventual national runner-up, [[Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball|University of Illinois]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=254000061 | title=Arizona 89, Illinois 90 | publisher=ESPN |date= |accessdate=2008-03-30 }}</ref>\n\nOlson took an unexplained leave of absence at the beginning of the 2007\u20132008 season.

[[The Pride of Arizona]] pep band and the [[Zona Zoo]].\n* Before every game, the band splits into four sections in the four sides of McKale Center. They play [[Bear Down]] Arizona in sequence before the band runs back to the student section in the north stands and plays all of Bear Down. The band also yells \"Hi fans!\" to the fans, who respond by yelling \"Hi band!\" and \"Hi Sean!\" to head coach [[Sean Miller]], who responds by waving to the band. The band also yells \"Hi Adia!\" to Arizona women's basketball coach [[Adia Barnes]].\n* While the opposing team's players are being introduced, the student section turns their backs to the court. As each player's name is announced, they will yell \"Sucks!\" In the interest of sportsmanship, though, the Athletic Department is attempting to phase this tradition out.\n* At the start of each half, the entire crowd will stand until the other team scores a point. The fans will also clap rhythmically with the band as it plays a four-note refrain repeatedly until the ball is tipped or inbounded.\n* During the first four minutes of each half, or until the first media timeout, the band and students have several chants.\n** Every time an opposing player dribbles, the yell is \"Boing!\"\n** Every time they pass, the yell is \"Pass!\"\n** Every time they try to shoot, the yell is \"Brick!\"\n* When an opposing player fouls an Arizona player, the band and students chant, while pointing at the opposing player, \"You! You! You! You! You! You! You! You! You! On you, that's who!\" If the foul occurs during a shot and the player makes the shot, the chant is instead \"Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! No no no no! No no no no! No no no no! No no no no! Don't touch me!\"\n* If an opposing player accrues four fouls during the game, they will chant \"Four!\" four times while waving four fingers. If a player fouls out, the band plays the beat from \"[[Another One Bites the Dust]]\", concluding with the band and students yelling \"Hey! We're gonna get you too!\"\n* When opposing players are attempting foul shots, besides attempting to distract the player, the band and students have several chants, but the only constant one is yelled if the player misses their first shot of a two-shot foul, in which case they yell \"Nice shot, buddy!\"\n* If Arizona is beating an opponent by a comfortable margin late in the game, the band and students will chant \"Go start the bus!\" repeatedly. If an opponent makes a big play, they will chant \"It just doesn't matter!\"\n* Since the 1980s, the \"Ooh Aah Man\" Joe Cavaleri has made appearances at McKale to pump up the crowd. He starts by spelling out \"A-R-I-Z-O-N-A!\" with his body as the crowd chants along. He then directs the crowd in chanting \"U of A!\", first by each side of the arena, then by the north and south sides and east and west sides simultaneously then by the whole arena. His routine usually involves pulling off his shirt and pants to reveal another Arizona shirt and shorts underneath. Unfortunately, Cavaleri was recently diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]] and has only made a few appearances during the 2010\u20132011 season.<ref>{{cite news |title=UCLA game thread |author=Pascoe, Bruce |url=http://azstarnet.com/sports/blogs/pascoe/article_bd03b9b2-2a80-11e0-a8c2-001cc4c03286.html |newspaper=Arizona Daily Star |date=27 January 2011 |accessdate=27 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=UA's top fan sidelined |author=Hansen, Greg |url=http://azstarnet.com/sports/basketball/college/wildcats/article_27582e03-9aab-5a35-9155-99e3b30b07d9.html |newspaper=Arizona Daily Star |date=23 December 2010 |accessdate=17 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube|id=y9atqBD-89M|title=Ooh Aah Man at McKale vs ASU 1/15/11}}</ref>\n* At the end of every home game (and every Arizona athletics event the band is present at) the band plays Arizona's alma mater, \"All Hail, Arizona!\" Students and fans link arms, sway as they sing and jump up and down while singing the last part of the song.\n* The team hosts an annual \"White Out\" game.

The property is owned by [[RailCorp]]. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999 where it is also known as the '''Tahmoor Railway Station Group''' and '''Lupton's Inn'''.<ref name=nswshr-1258>{{cite NSW SHR|5012233|Tahmoor Railway Station Group|hr=01258|fn=H06/00251/|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref> The station opened on 13 July 1919 at the same time as a new alignment between [[Picton railway station|Picton]] and [[Mittagong railway station|Mittagong]] railway stations.<ref>[http://www.nswrail.net/locations/show.php?name=NSW:Tahmoor Tahmoor Station] NSWrail.net</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe Tahmoor Railway Precinct is located on the Main South line. The \"Great Southern Railway\" originally opened from [[Picton, New South Wales|Picton]] to [[Mittagong]] via a loop line in 1867. In 1919, the Main South line from Picton was deviated to Mittagong to ease the grades. The new line virtually follows the line of the [[Great South Road (New South Wales)|Great South Road]] taking the main line away from [[Thirlmere, New South Wales|Thirlmere]], [[Buxton, New South Wales|Buxton]], Balmoral and Hilltop and passing through Tahmoor, [[Bargo, New South Wales|Bargo]] and [[Yerrinbool, New South Wales|Yerrinbool]].<ref name=nswshr-1258/>\n\nThe construction of the new deviation caused concern for the towns along the existing line anxious the deviation would have a detrimental effect on property and development: \"Samuel Emmett who held {{convert|4000|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} of land near Hilltop could no longer hope to make any profit from it. Not to be thwarted, Sam purchased hundreds of acres of land near where it was proposed to build a new railway platform along the Bargo road (and) subdivided the land into some 600 building blocks which now forms the nucleus of the township of Tahmoor...The deviation works brought hundreds of men and their families to the area creating an urgent need for postal facilities and shops. Sam Emmett was again ahead of the rest, applying for the re establishment of a post office which he proposed to be in premises attached to a shop which he was in the process of building... The application for a post office was approved, however the identity of the location was still in question... Sam's preference of 'Bronzewing Park'&hellip;The Railway Department advised that the new platform would be called \"Tahmoor\", Aboriginal{{dubious|date=April 2020}}<!--\"Aboriginal\" isn't a language--> for bronzewing pigeon... In order to expedite the matter, the Postal Department took the side of the Railway Department and directed that the new Post Office be called \"Tahmoor\". Tahmoor Post Office commenced operations on 1 September 1916 with Sam as Postmaster\".<ref name=nswshr-1258-1778>Fairfax, 2009</ref><ref name=nswshr-1258/>\n\nTahmoor Station opened with the completion of the double track deviation between Picton and Mittagong which opened on 13 July 1919. The station was constructed with two side platforms with a small timber station building on the Down Platform (platform 2). The building is a standard A2 building which was part of a standard set of designs introduced from the 1900s and reissued again in 1913. Most examples date from 1910/20s. The smaller A1 - A4 structures were wayside buildings predominantly constructed of timber weatherboard in country locations with a gabled roof and continuous awning.<ref name=nswshr-1258/>\n\nThe station also featured an A1 standard sitting room and WC on the Up Platform (platform 1). A lamp room was also constructed on the Up Platform after 1919 and later converted to a WC.<ref name=nswshr-1258/>\n\nThe waiting room on the Up Platform was destroyed by fire in 1979. In 1989 a standard open shelter was built on the Up platform which protects a ticket vending machine.

The \"Great Southern Railway\" originally opened from [[Picton, New South Wales|Picton]] to [[Mittagong]] via a loop line in 1867. In 1919, the Main South line from Picton was deviated to Mittagong to ease the grades. The new line virtually follows the line of the [[Great South Road (New South Wales)|Great South Road]] taking the main line away from [[Thirlmere, New South Wales|Thirlmere]], [[Buxton, New South Wales|Buxton]], Balmoral and Hilltop and passing through Tahmoor, [[Bargo, New South Wales|Bargo]] and [[Yerrinbool, New South Wales|Yerrinbool]].<ref name=nswshr-1258/>\n\nThe construction of the new deviation caused concern for the towns along the existing line anxious the deviation would have a detrimental effect on property and development: \"Samuel Emmett who held {{convert|4000|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} of land near Hilltop could no longer hope to make any profit from it. Not to be thwarted, Sam purchased hundreds of acres of land near where it was proposed to build a new railway platform along the Bargo road (and) subdivided the land into some 600 building blocks which now forms the nucleus of the township of Tahmoor...The deviation works brought hundreds of men and their families to the area creating an urgent need for postal facilities and shops. Sam Emmett was again ahead of the rest, applying for the re establishment of a post office which he proposed to be in premises attached to a shop which he was in the process of building... The application for a post office was approved, however the identity of the location was still in question... Sam's preference of 'Bronzewing Park'&hellip;The Railway Department advised that the new platform would be called \"Tahmoor\", Aboriginal{{dubious|date=April 2020}}<!--\"Aboriginal\" isn't a language--> for bronzewing pigeon... In order to expedite the matter, the Postal Department took the side of the Railway Department and directed that the new Post Office be called \"Tahmoor\". Tahmoor Post Office commenced operations on 1 September 1916 with Sam as Postmaster\".<ref name=nswshr-1258-1778>Fairfax, 2009</ref><ref name=nswshr-1258/>\n\nTahmoor Station opened with the completion of the double track deviation between Picton and Mittagong which opened on 13 July 1919. The station was constructed with two side platforms with a small timber station building on the Down Platform (platform 2). The building is a standard A2 building which was part of a standard set of designs introduced from the 1900s and reissued again in 1913. Most examples date from 1910/20s. The smaller A1 - A4 structures were wayside buildings predominantly constructed of timber weatherboard in country locations with a gabled roof and continuous awning.<ref name=nswshr-1258/>\n\nThe station also featured an A1 standard sitting room and WC on the Up Platform (platform 1). A lamp room was also constructed on the Up Platform after 1919 and later converted to a WC.<ref name=nswshr-1258/>\n\nThe waiting room on the Up Platform was destroyed by fire in 1979. In 1989 a standard open shelter was built on the Up platform which protects a ticket vending machine.
