However, this may have been based on his misreading of the words ''Deo notus'' in the second ''Passio Ursulae'', written about 1105. The plot may have been influenced by a story told by the 6th-century writer [[Procopius]] about a British queen sailing with 100,000 soldiers to the mouth of the Rhine in order to compel her unwilling groom Radigis, king of the [[Warini|Varni]], to marry her.\n\nWhile there was a tradition of virgin martyrs in Cologne by the fifth century, their number may have been limited to between two and eleven, according to different sources. Yet the cleric [[Wandelbert]] of the [[Abbey of Pr\u00fcm]] stated in his [[martyrology]] in 848 that the number of martyrs counted \"thousands of saints\" who were slaughtered on the boards of the River Rhine.<ref>Levison, ''Das Werden der Ursula Legende''.</ref> The 11,000 were first mentioned in the late 9th century; suggestions as to where this number came from have included the reading of the name ''Undecimillia'' or ''Ximillia'' as a number, or reading the abbreviation ''XI. M. V.'' as 'eleven thousand [in Roman numerals] virgins' rather than 'eleven martyred virgins'. One scholar has suggested that in the eighth or ninth century, when the relics of virgin martyrs were found, they included those of a girl named Ursula, who was eleven years old\u2014in [[Latin]], ''undecimilia''. This was subsequently misread or misinterpreted as ''undicimila'' ('eleven thousand'), thus producing the legend of the 11,000 virgins.<ref>[http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/74550 Santi Beati: Sant'Orsola e compagne]</ref> In fact, the stone bearing the virgin Ursula's name states that she lived eight years and two months. Another theory is that there was only one virgin martyr, named Undecimilla, \"which by some blundering monk was changed into eleven thousand\".<ref name=\"rochester1\">[http://www.history.rochester.edu/pennymag/212/cologne.htm ''The Penny Magazine'': Cologne] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103013103/http://www.history.rochester.edu/pennymag/212/cologne.htm |date=2011-11-03 }}</ref> It has also been suggested that ''cum [...] militibus'', 'with [...] soldiers', was misread as ''cum [...] millibus'', 'with [...] thousands'.<ref name=\"encyclopedia1\" /> Most contemporary sources, however, cling to the number 11,000. The ''Passio'' from the 970s tries to bridge conflicting traditions by stating that the eleven maidens each commanded a ship containing one thousand virgins. Implicitly, the legend also refers to the twelve heavenly legions, mentioned in Matthew 26:53.\n\n[[File:StaUrsulaCepleanu.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The Martyrdom of Saint Ursula (German school, 16th century)]]\n\nThe Basilica of St. Ursula in Cologne holds the alleged [[relics]] of Ursula and her 11,000 companions.<ref name=\"rochester1\"/> It contains what has been described as a \"veritable tsunami of ribs, shoulder blades, and femurs ... arranged in zigzags and swirls and even in the shapes of Latin words.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated169\">Quigley, Christine (2001) ''Skulls and Skeletons: Human Bone Collections and Accumulations'', Jefferson, N.C.; London: McFarland; p. 169.</ref> The Goldene Kammer (Golden Chamber), a 17th-century chapel attached to the Basilica of St. Ursula, contains sculptures of their heads and torsos, \"some of the heads encased in silver, others covered with stuff of gold and caps of cloth of gold and velvet; loose bones thickly texture the upper walls.\"<ref name=\"rochester1\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated169\"/> The peculiarities of the relics themselves have thrown doubt upon the historicity of Ursula and her 11,000 maidens.

Yet the cleric [[Wandelbert]] of the [[Abbey of Pr\u00fcm]] stated in his [[martyrology]] in 848 that the number of martyrs counted \"thousands of saints\" who were slaughtered on the boards of the River Rhine.<ref>Levison, ''Das Werden der Ursula Legende''.</ref> The 11,000 were first mentioned in the late 9th century; suggestions as to where this number came from have included the reading of the name ''Undecimillia'' or ''Ximillia'' as a number, or reading the abbreviation ''XI. M. V.'' as 'eleven thousand [in Roman numerals] virgins' rather than 'eleven martyred virgins'. One scholar has suggested that in the eighth or ninth century, when the relics of virgin martyrs were found, they included those of a girl named Ursula, who was eleven years old\u2014in [[Latin]], ''undecimilia''. This was subsequently misread or misinterpreted as ''undicimila'' ('eleven thousand'), thus producing the legend of the 11,000 virgins.<ref>[http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/74550 Santi Beati: Sant'Orsola e compagne]</ref> In fact, the stone bearing the virgin Ursula's name states that she lived eight years and two months. Another theory is that there was only one virgin martyr, named Undecimilla, \"which by some blundering monk was changed into eleven thousand\".<ref name=\"rochester1\">[http://www.history.rochester.edu/pennymag/212/cologne.htm ''The Penny Magazine'': Cologne] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103013103/http://www.history.rochester.edu/pennymag/212/cologne.htm |date=2011-11-03 }}</ref> It has also been suggested that ''cum [...] militibus'', 'with [...] soldiers', was misread as ''cum [...] millibus'', 'with [...] thousands'.<ref name=\"encyclopedia1\" /> Most contemporary sources, however, cling to the number 11,000. The ''Passio'' from the 970s tries to bridge conflicting traditions by stating that the eleven maidens each commanded a ship containing one thousand virgins. Implicitly, the legend also refers to the twelve heavenly legions, mentioned in Matthew 26:53.\n\n[[File:StaUrsulaCepleanu.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The Martyrdom of Saint Ursula (German school, 16th century)]]\n\nThe Basilica of St. Ursula in Cologne holds the alleged [[relics]] of Ursula and her 11,000 companions.<ref name=\"rochester1\"/> It contains what has been described as a \"veritable tsunami of ribs, shoulder blades, and femurs ... arranged in zigzags and swirls and even in the shapes of Latin words.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated169\">Quigley, Christine (2001) ''Skulls and Skeletons: Human Bone Collections and Accumulations'', Jefferson, N.C.; London: McFarland; p. 169.</ref> The Goldene Kammer (Golden Chamber), a 17th-century chapel attached to the Basilica of St. Ursula, contains sculptures of their heads and torsos, \"some of the heads encased in silver, others covered with stuff of gold and caps of cloth of gold and velvet; loose bones thickly texture the upper walls.\"<ref name=\"rochester1\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated169\"/> The peculiarities of the relics themselves have thrown doubt upon the historicity of Ursula and her 11,000 maidens.

Their first match was a home defeat by Hull City.

A memorable F.A.Cup run in 1975 saw them play West Ham United in the final at Wembley, losing 0-2. Tough times were ahead in the late '80s/early '90s when they slipped to next to bottom of the old Third Division at one time. But by 2001 Fulham were promoted to the Top Division, The Premiership.\n\nThen followed a decade of top flight football at Craven Cottage in the Premiership, once finishing in 7th place. But it wasn't going to last forever as they were relegated to the new Championship in 2014 for a few seasons, but after being promoted to the Premiership (again) via the play-offs in May 2018, Fulham had a tough time throughout the 2018-2019 season and after two managerial changes, were relegated after that one season in May 2019.

For a short while at the beginning of the 2000's, Fulham played at Loftus Road whilst their own ground was being re-developed to Premiership standards.|alt=A colour photograph of Craven Cottage football stadium, showing the pitch in the centre of the image, surrounded stands. At the top of the photo, the word 'Fulham' is spelt out in white lettering on the black seats.]]\nThis article shows the record of [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham Football Club]] against each of the Football League clubs they have played against in all four divisions since 1907.\nFulham's first competitive match was against Maidenhead United on September 10th 1898 in the Southern League but by September 3rd 1907 they had been promoted to the Football League Division Two. Their first match was a home defeat by Hull City. Apart from a brief spell of four seasons in Division 3 (S) they stayed in League Division 2 until promoted to the (old) Division One for the first time in 1949. A memorable F.A.Cup run in 1975 saw them play West Ham United in the final at Wembley, losing 0-2. Tough times were ahead in the late '80s/early '90s when they slipped to next to bottom of the old Third Division at one time. But by 2001 Fulham were promoted to the Top Division, The Premiership.\n\nThen followed a decade of top flight football at Craven Cottage in the Premiership, once finishing in 7th place. But it wasn't going to last forever as they were relegated to the new Championship in 2014 for a few seasons, but after being promoted to the Premiership (again) via the play-offs in May 2018, Fulham had a tough time throughout the 2018-2019 season and after two managerial changes, were relegated after that one season in May 2019. The popular ex midfield player Scott Parker was appointed manager in May and the club looks forward to a return to the Premiership, in due course.\n\n==Key==\n*The records include the results of matches played in [[The Football League]] only (1907-2019).

There were two main reactions to this leaked recording in Singapore. Mainly, those who are in support of Chan's candidness and those who derided Chan for speaking in [[Singlish]] and belittling Singaporeans in the process. This was in response to Chan calling Singaporeans \u201cidiots\u201d for being part of the runs on supermarkets and causing undue panic.

It was written by John Howard Palevich, originally for his undergraduate thesis while at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]. ''Dandy'' is one of the first games to offer simultaneous, four-player, cooperative play. It was the direct inspiration for the popular 1985 [[Atari Games]] coin-op, ''[[Gauntlet (1985 video game)|Gauntlet]]'', and later turned into the '''''Dark Chambers''''' home game published by [[Atari Corporation]].\n\nIn 1986, [[Electric Dreams Software]] published versions of ''Dandy'' for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[Amstrad CPC]].{{cn|date=April 2017}} This was after the release of ''Gauntlet'', and these versions of ''Dandy'' are visually closer to the arcade game than the Atari 8-bit original.\n\nThe name ''Dandy'' is a play on D&D, the common abbreviation for ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Dandy opening.png|thumb|upright=4|right|Screenshot]]\n\n''Dandy'' takes place in a maze-like dungeon, seen from an overhead view. The dungeon has multiple levels, connected together using stairwells. Portions of the mazes are blocked by locked doors, which can be opened with keys scattered through the maze. The goal of the game is to fight through the maze to the next stairwell, from there to the next level, and proceed through the dungeon's levels to the end.\n\nThe players are armed with a [[bow and arrow]] which can be shot in any of the eight [[cardinal direction]]s. Monsters come in several varieties, though the differences are strictly graphical. When hit, the monsters \"devolve\" to the next less-powerful state, before eventually being killed and disappearing. Some monsters are placed in the maze during its pre-game creation and appear as soon as that level is entered, while others are produced in skull-shaped monster generators.\n\nMonsters touching the player reduce the player's health, which can be improved by eating food scattered around the dungeon. Potions destroy all monsters on the screen when activated. Potions can be either shot with an arrow, or picked up and carried for later use. A special \"heart of gold\" can also be collected to revive dead party members.\n\nPlayers interact with the game primarily through the [[joystick]], although some key-presses are used for eating food or using potions. With two or more players, the screen scrolls according to the average location of the group to encourage cooperation.\n\n==History==\n\n===''Thesis of Terror''===\n{{refimprove|section|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe game that eventually became ''Dandy'' had been originally written in the fall of 1982 as ''Thesis of Terror'', Jack Palevich's [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] bachelor's thesis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atariarchives.org/APX/showinfo.php?cat=20210 |title=Dandy |publisher=atariarchives.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25}}</ref> The original concept was for a five-person game, four players on Atari computers acting as graphical terminals, and a fifth machine acting as [[dungeon master]] controlling the action from a separate computer. The two machines would communicate over their serial ports. However, time constraints meant that the interactive dungeon master role was never implemented. The separate machine, a Hewlett-Packard Pascal Workstation (a member of the [[HP 9000]] family), was used solely as a file server, sending new maps to the Atari on demand.\n\nThe [[game engine]] was inspired by [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]]'s ''[[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]]''. ''Life'' is [[cellular automaton|cellular automata]]; at each \"turn\" the game examines the squares on the grid that makes up the playfield, and uses a basic calculation to determine whether or not that square should hold a cell. In ''Dandy'' this same basic mechanism is used, but the decision was essentially \"if the player is on that side of the cell, and there is a monster on the other side, then I will hold a monster on the next turn.\" This gave the illusion of the monsters chasing the player, when in fact they did not move at all. Like a [[marquee (sign)|marquee]], the motion was an illusion as they simply turned on or off. This algorithm was easy to implement using the limited resources of the Atari 800; it takes the same time to run no matter how many monsters were currently in the map. It also has the property that any dungeon that could be drawn in the editor will run correctly and efficiently, the designer does not have to worry about \"correct\" placement of the monsters or generators to ensure the map would.\n\nThe gameplay design of ''Thesis of Terror'' was heavily influenced by ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''; Palevich had never actually played ''D&D'', but he had read through the manuals and watched some of his dorm-mates play campaigns in the lounge of MIT's [[New House II]] dormitory. The new name ''Dandy'' is a play on the phonetic pronunciation of ''D and D'', which at the time was a generic term for dungeon adventure role-playing games. ''Dandy'' was also influenced by the ''[[Defender (1981 video game)|Defender]]'' arcade game, which contributed the idea of the smart bomb (potions), and by several maze-exploration arcade games that contributed the idea of using keys to unlock doors. ''Dandy'' was not influenced by any of the [[roguelike]] games, as Palevich was unaware of ''[[Rogue (video game)|Rogue]]'' at the time ''Dandy'' was designed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://jacks-hacks.appspot.com/dandy/history.html |title=A History of Dandy Dungeon |accessdate=2013-11-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104190048/http://jacks-hacks.appspot.com/dandy/history.html |archivedate=2013-11-04 }}</ref>\n\n''Thesis of Terror'''s gameplay was designed with help from Joel Gluck, who was a freshman at MIT at the time. Gluck designed several of the levels in the game, and invented some of the common idioms of ''Dandy''-style games. For example, he designed the \"funnel trap\", where treasure was placed in such a way that the players would run to the treasure, causing a wall of monsters placed just off screen to activate and charge on the party.\n\nSeveral changes were made to the gameplay as a result of playtesting. Early versions of the game allowed players to shoot each other, but this was removed after testing showed that when the players discovered that they could hurt each other, the game quickly degenerated into a chaotic free-for-all. Another change was that dead players originally had to sit out the rest of the game. Testing revealed that parties would start the game over when one member died, so that the whole party could continue to play together. To keep the game going, the revival heart was added.\n\n===Creation of ''Dandy''===\nAfter graduating from MIT, Palevich went to work for Atari in the Atari Research division. He helped design the operating system for the unreleased [[Atari Sierra]] personal computer. He worked on the [[Atari AMY]] sound chip which was never used in a shipping product.<ref>[http://www.atarimuseum.com/computers/8bits/xe/xe_protos/65xem.html \"Atari 65XEM\"], see \"''One of the original programmers of the AMY chips software was John Palevich...''\"</ref>\n\nWhile working at Atari, Palevich continued developing the game. During the period from February to May 1983, the original was cleaned up for release, and it was during this period that the name became ''Dandy''. The workstation was removed, and the dungeon master's role was reduced to laying out the maps and saving them to [[floppy disk]]. Another change was to remove the ability to return to higher levels of the dungeon. This change was made after play-testing revealed that nobody ever went up to previous levels, except by mistake. Removing this feature sped up level changes, because the maze state no longer had to be written out to disk before the next level was loaded. It also enabled the game to work on [[cassette tape]] as well as on disk; on the tape version the cassette tape was stopped between levels, and then started up again to load the next level.\n\n[[Atari Program Exchange]] advertised ''Dandy'' as \"the great new team game ...

Ostensibly, Tomica diecast were an outgrowth of Tomica World, an autonomous toy line of motorized [[train]] accessories that Tomy had created based on [[Plarail]] and produced since 1959 (About Tomica 2013). Similar in concept, Tomica can be thought of as the [[Matchbox (brand)|Matchbox]] of Japan - but focuses mainly on Japanese brands.\n\n== History ==\nTomy Co. of Japan was founded in 1924 by Eijira Tomiyama in Tokyo (Robinson 2010). The company has produced a variety of toys, but in 1970 started production of the Tomica line of diecast vehicles as a result of the surge of interest in the global market in toy cars which was led mainly by Matchbox and Mattel's Hot Wheels (About Tomica 2013). Although models of various scales have been made, the name \"Tomica\" normally refers to the 3-inch sized mainstream vehicles most commonly produced by the company. Originally, the name \"Pocket Cars\" was given to Tomicas sold in the 1970s in the United States.  After four decades, Tomy Corporation again entered the North American and European markets with the Tomica name in 2010.\n\n[[File:Tomica 45 1.jpg|left|thumb|\"Black box\" Tomica from the 1980s of a Suzuki Carry noodle service truck.]]\n\n== Typical Tomicas ==\n=== Tomica Domestic Series (\"Black Box\" / \"Red & White Box\") ===\nInitially, Tomica only produced Japanese brand cars and trucks. This started with the release of six models in 1970. The seventh was issued later in the year. From that time, the Tomica line grew until there was a total of 109 concurrent models by 1978 \u2014 number 1 through 108 and also number 110 (109 was proposed, but never released). The variety of models also expanded from the initial [[coup\u00e9]]s and [[Sedan (automobile)|sedans]] to [[taxicab|taxis]], [[bus]]es, trucks, construction and other commercial vehicles. Even a [[steam engine]] and an ocean liner were offered. As new models were issued, each was assigned a number up to 110, replacing an existing model.\n\n[[File:Tomica 63 1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|\"Pocket Cars\" packaging was for the North American market.]]\n\nIn the early 1980s, Tomy experienced financial difficulties, and in 1983 the domestic model line was reduced to only 80 models (nos. 1 \u2013 80). These models were mainly packaged in picture boxes that had black background with yellow flaps. Later, new models came in a box with a red and white background (Rixon 2005, 99). Existing models issued before 1984 kept using the older style box with black background until 1988, when all boxes were updated to the new style. Hence, domestic models are commonly referred to as the \"black box\" or \"red and white Box\" models.\n\n=== Tomica Foreign Series (\"Blue & White Box\" / \"Pocket Cars\") ===\nTo compete in the global toy car market, Tomy early on, had plans of exporting its models. This was done starting in 1974 with the appearance of \"Tomy Pocket Cars\" in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. The marketing ploy was a blister package designed like a denim jeans 'pocket' with yellow 'stitching' around the outside of the card and the vehicle. Since Japanese cars were not yet booming sellers overseas, in 1976 Tomy started producing 'foreign' (non-Japanese) models. Present were [[United States|American]], [[Germany|German]], [[Italy|Italian]], [[United Kingdom|British]], and [[France|French]] cars, among others, making the Tomica product line more global.\n\nPartly because Pocket Cars were more expensive than Hot Wheels or Matchboxes in the American market, this blister pack series was not seen much after 1979 (Johnson 1998, 233). Tomica continued successfully, however, in the home market, where each foreign car was packaged in a picture box that showed a [[flag]] of the country of origin of that particular car. The boxes often did not show the number of the car, but it could be seen on the base. Since these boxes have the base colors of blue and white, they are also called the \"blue-and-white box\" models. At any one time, a total of 70 models were produced under the foreign line, numbered F1 to F70.\n\n[[File:Daihatsumidget.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A Bajaj / Diahatsu Midget 3 wheeled delivery truck of the ubiquitous type. A very authentic Asian Tomica rendering.]]\n\nThese cars from the 1970s and 1980s hold their value well. {{as of|2019}} they sell for between $15 and $20 US on eBay and other on-line sales sites. Perhaps because of their greater scarcity as well as realism, these values hold up much better than most Matchbox vehicles from the same time period.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\n=== Tomica Common Series (\"Red-and-White Box\") ===\n[[File:Tomica Heaven (3776703008).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Common series sales shelf in Japan.]]\n\nIn 1988, Tomy combined its foreign models into the domestic series. Most of the first 40 models from the foreign series were added to the 80 domestic models. Those foreign models that got transferred were assigned a number that was its F series number plus 80. A handful of these foreign models were discontinued after a few months\u2019 appearance under the new line. Overall about half of them had been discontinued after two years.\n\n=== Tomica Limited Series ===\nFrom 2001 to 2013, Tomy produced the TL series targeted for the collector. These models are made with higher details, and one of their biggest features is realistic-looking wheels with rubberized plastic tires. Although many of them are based on existing or discontinued regular Tomica models, some are new castings made exclusively for the TL line, namely, Nissan Skyline GTB, Toyoda AA, and new [[Mini Hatch|MINI Cooper]]. In the case of the new MINI Cooper, the model was first released for the TL series in 2004 but in 2006 included in the regular line as no. 43. Model numbers started at 0001. Each model is produced for a limited period of time, so models with smaller numbers are discontinued while new models with higher numbers continue to appear. These models are packaged in open cardboard boxes surrounded on four sides with a transparent plastic sleeve.\n\n=== Special, Promotional and Event models ===\n[[File:Tomica subary legacy.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The original promotional model issue of the Subaru Legacy Touring Wagon (right) and its regular model issue.]]\n\nTomica has produced a number of special models over the years. These are unique models that are not found in the regular line or the Limited Series. There are four types of special model:\n*An existing regular model with small modifications or additions of accessories. These can be in the form of TEM (Tomica Event Models, Tomica shop exclusives, as well as gift/box sets.\n*A truck model that shares the cab and the chassis of an existing model. These are also common for gift sets although also found as stand-alone models.\n*A model that is based on an existing model but has the major car body modified. Examples are:\n** [[Honda S800|Honda S800M]] Convertible modified from no. 23 Honda S800M\n** [[Mitsubishi Pajero]] Rally Type was modified from no. 30 Mitsubishi Pajero Metal Top. This model was produced for the [[Ralliart]] Team Set.\n** [[Toyota AE86|Toyota Sprinter Trueno AE-86 Hatchback]], modified from no. 78 [[Toyota Sprinter]] Trueno Coupe. This was produced for the [[Initial D]] Set.\n*A totally new casting. All of these had been produced under the contract of another model company or another business. Their common fate is that Tomy eventually issues them as regular models. Examples include:\n** [[Nissan Skyline]] GT-R R33 Racing Type (issued as no. 40 in 1997)\n** [[Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution]] IV (issued as no. 104 in 2000)\n** [[Mitsubishi Fuso Canter|Mitsubishi New Canter Panel Truck]] (issued as no. 29 in 2003)\n** [[Subaru Legacy]] Touring Wagon (issued as no. 11 in 2003)\n** [[Hummer H2]] (issued as no. 15 in 2007)\n** [[Nissan Laurel]] (issued as no. LV-52 in 2007)\n** [[Isuzu Giga]] (issued as no. 76 in 2007)\n* Also, in 2004, no. 121 was available for a limited period from Mitsuoka Motors. This was a 1/1 scale electric single seater vehicle which featured a retro Citroen H Van front end and side panels.\n\n=== Japan, China, Hong Kong, Thailand, and Vietnam Castings ===\nUntil 1993, Tomica models were almost exclusively produced by Tomy in their local factory in [[Tokyo]], Japan. However, since the early years, Tomy had outsourced some production to another country with cheaper labor cost. By mid-2003, all production were outsourced and Tomy no longer produced any Tomica in their own factory.\n\n[[Hong Kong]] was the first place outside of Japan where Tomica cars were produced. The production in Hong Kong only lasted a few years. Six models issued in 1971 and 1972 were made in Hong Kong:\n*1971 - No.10 [[Honda N360]]\n*1971 - No.11 Toyota Sprinter\n*1971 - No.12 [[Mazda Capella]] Rotary Coupe\n*1972 - No.30 [[Mitsubishi Galant]]\n*1972 - No.33 [[Nissan Cedric]]\n*1972 - No.42 [[Datsun]] 1300 Pick-Up\n\n[[File:Tomica Baseplates.jpg|left|thumb|The first decade of the 21st century saw the most variations in country of production of Tomica. From top to bottom: Thailand 2010, China 2006, Japan 2003, Vietnam 2009]]\n\nLimited production in [[China]] started in 1990 with a few existing models in the regular line, like the no. 35 DOME Toyota Celica and no. 73 Isuzu Dump. Large scale production in China started in 1993 with the \"British Line\" of 36 models that Tomy Company of UK contracted Tomy of Japan to produce by using existing tooling. As a result, regular models of the same castings were also made in China beginning in 1993. Starting in 1994, all the new models in the regular line were made in China, and in May 1995, the production of existing models started to move to China as well. This was done in phases. By July 1997, all regular line Tomica cars were made in China. There were a few exceptions to this rule: \n\n*No. 9 [[Komatsu Limited|Komatsu]] Power Shovel PC200, issued in 1995, was made in Japan because the model was already planned in 1994 and also because it shared components with the older no. 9. Production was moved to China when the model was produced for a gift set later in 1995.\n*No. 20 Nissan Skyline GT-R R33, issued in 1995, was made in Japan because the model was also used for special releases under the contract of II ADO, a popular chain of minicar shops in [[Japan]]. Production was moved to China in 1997 along with others during the last phase of moving.\n*No. 30 Mitsubishi Pajero, issued in 1999, was made in Japan because the model was concurrently issued as a special promotional model for Mitsubishi Motors in Japan. Production moved to China after two months, when the promotion stopped.\n*No. 105 [[Coca-Cola]] Route Truck, issued in 1996, was made in Japan as well. However, this model was simply a different colour and livery on an existing casting, so it was not truly a new model.\n\nWhile production in Japan ceased in 1997 for the regular models, Tomy kept producing special models in Japan until 2003, using old castings not used for mass production of the British line, regular models, or gift sets.  Because these older castings had remained in Japan, special releases and promotional issues using these older castings were still made in Japan. New castings for special models were also made in Japan. The Subaru Legacy from 2003 was the last Tomica ever produced in Japan.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nProduction of Tomicas started to move to [[Vietnam]] in early 2009. This was also done in phases and took several years. Unlike the move from Japan to China during which no new regular models were made in Japan (besides the few exceptions), during this time new releases came from both Vietnam and China until 2013.\n\nIn 2010, when Technology Tomica was introduced, they were initially made in [[Thailand]]. In 2012, production moved to Vietnam.\n\n=== Wheel styles ===\n[[File:Tomy trucking a.jpg|right|thumb|A Toyota Hiace from the 1970s with older 2-piece wheels.]]\n[[File:TomicaMorganPlusEight.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A Morgan Plus Eight. Note the typical five studded wheel style.]]\n\nThe earliest Tomica cars had one-piece [[Chrome plating|chrome-plated]] wheels. Starting in 1971, models were produced with two-piece wheels of various styles, with the one-piece chrome-plated wheels being phased out in 1972 (except that all the models made in Hong Kong had the one-piece wheel design). The two-piece wheels were used until 1977, while newer one-piece wheels of various styles have been adopted since 1976, and are still used today.\n\nThe most common design is a five-spoke chrome on black plastic form that appears to have five (four before 2007) 'studs' around the edge of the wheel (It is commonly referred to as the 4/5 studded wheel). This design has even been continued with the newer vehicles made in Vietnam. Another common style is a black plastic wheel with a single chrome ring and no other outstanding detail (This is also refers to the racing wheels) . Later Tomicas have a slightly redesigned wheel design, with the 'studs' slightly smaller. Some SUVs (e.g. Nissan X-Trail, Mitsubishi Pajero) have a 4-spoke chrome with grooves on the outside.\n\n== Other Series ==\n\n=== Long Tomica ===\n[[File:Long Tomica.jpg|right|thumb|New long vehicles from the Tomica regular line are a bit smaller than the original Long Tomicas.]]\n\nLonger buses and semi-trailer trucks were models not suitable for the regular small boxes, so Tomy also started the \"Long Tomica\" series in 1977. Castings such as trucks, articulated buses or Shinkansen trains were produced as single models until 1993. However, some of these long models still appeared in gift sets after 1993, such as the JAL Airport Vehicles Set. Many of these were specifically for foreign markets, like the Trathen's Skyliner bus which made the Plymouth to London trek in the U.K. (Rixon 2005, 102). Beginning in 2009, Tomy produces newer versions of \"Long Tomica\", such as the newest Shinkansen trains or large semi trailer trucks, as part of the regular series under model numbers 121 to 140. \n\n=== Combat Tomica ===\nEarlier, Tomy produced the 1/87 diecast Combat Tomica series. The line started with the model M-60 U.S. Army Medium Tank, and later on, models such as the U.S. M-60A-1E-1, the German TIGER-I, the Japanese Type 61 and the Russian SU-85 were produced. There were two types of Combat Tomica but they both contained exactly the same models. The first one was like regular Tomica models; the models came in a paper box, there were some soldier figures for decoration and a set of wheels because the tracks were fixed and did not actually function. The second type was the metal model kits that required manual assembly. These came in larger boxes inside containing the parts for assembly. Production of the Combat Tomicas lasted only a few years, however Tomy continued producing military vehicles such as rocket launcher trucks, troop trucks, and jeeps, for its regular \"3-inch\" line-up.\n\n=== Tomica Dandy ===\n[[File:Tomica Dandy.jpg|left|thumb|Tomica Dandy Nissan Bluebird in 1/35, one of the larger scale. Most cars were 1/43.]]\n\nTomica Dandy cars are larger - about 1:43 scale and were produced from 1972 until 1993. At first they were all Japanese domestic models, but similar to the common Tomicas, the Dandy line also began to offer foreign brand vehicles in 1977 (for example, a Lotus Europa). The numbering system was changed in 1984 based on the nature of the vehicles (e.g. [[emergency vehicle|emergency]], [[police]], or foreign models). In 2001, Tomy reissued six Tomica Dandy models in limited quantities.\n\nDandys were diecast metal and most also had metal bases. Wheels looked authentic, but were hard black plastic and not rubber, which was normal for 1:43 diecast cars in the 1980s. Some Dandy cars had special features like the Mazda Savanna with \"pop-up\" headlights operated from a lever ''inside the car'' (Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, 77). Packaging colors varied and some were promotional models, but commonly, boxes were blue or red showing a perforated license plate shape with 'Dandy' written on the plate. Tomica Dandy castings have also been used in gift sets and the Limited S Series, but these models have the \"Dandy\" name on their base plates removed.\n\n\n=== Motorized Tomica ===\n[[File:Motorized Tomica.jpg|right|thumb|B/O Tomica came in a picture box while the later Motor Tomica came in a window box.]]\n\nTomy started producing motorized cars in the late 1970s beginning with the Power Tomica series. This series did not last long. In 1992, it released a new series called B/O Tomica (stands for [[battery (electricity)|battery]]-operated Tomica). This series was renamed Motor Tomica in 1997. They were produced and sold as single models until 2003. All the B/O Tomica are made in Japan, while all the Motor Tomica (including the Animated Motor Tomica) are made in China. To fit on the motorized base, these castings often have altered scales. In general, sport utility vehicles appear in their proper scales, saloons appear a bit bulky, and buses and lorries are disproportionately short. In 2005, a new series for motorized Tomica was released containing generic vehicles such as a police patrol car. This late series targets toddlers and is made of ABS plastic.\n\n=== Pullback Tomica ===\nThese first appeared in the 1980s and there were six models at that time. In the year 2002, Tomy again produced [[pullback motor|pullback]] models.\n\n=== Sound and Light Tomica ===\n[[File:Sound Tomica.jpg|left|thumb|Left: Sound Tomica from 1992. Right: Technology Tomica from 2011.]]\n\nFrom time to time, Tomy produces shorter runs of cars with sound or light or both, based on castings from the regular series. The first of such series was the Sound Tomica, introduced in 1992. These cars have both sound and light. Upon pressing one set of wheels, the sound and light are activated for a short time. The Siren Tomica series from 1996 replaced Sound Tomica. These are basically the same design except the batteries can be taken out and replaced. In 2000, Tomy came out with the Chat Tomica line. These cars do not have light, but depending on the model, upon activation, \"[t]hree types of recorded clips will be played (including the sound of sirens, voices and cries of animals).\" (T3: Sound of Tomicas 2008). Conversely, the Technology Tomica cars introduced in 2010 only have lights. What is special is that they do not require batteries. Rolling the cars produces the electricity to power the lights. This line also represents the only made-in-Thailand Tomica in existence to date. Most recently, Tomy has released the Tomica 4D line. These cars have engine sounds and vibrations.\n\n=== Tomica Limited Vintage ===\nStarting from 2004, Tomytec, a branch of Tomy, started producing realistic models - more for the collector market. They are marketed as the Tomica Limited Vintage Tomytec series and are mostly 1950s and 1960s classic Japanese vehicles such as the Honda S800, Nissan Cedric, Prince Gloria and Toyopet Crown. More details are evident on these compared to the regular Tomica models or even the Tomica Limited models.\n\nIn 2006 the Tomica Limited Vintage - Neo [TLV-N] line was created and currently includes vehicles from the 1970s and 1980s. As with the Limited Vintage series, the focus of the Limited Vintage - Neo series is on adult collectors. These models have a high level of realism, with more attention to details such as wheels, tires, paint, trim and emblems versus functions like opening parts or moving features but still has the suspension of the basic Tomica models. All the models are a consistent scale of 1/64 (Tomica Fan Club).\n\nThe Tomica Limited Vintage Neo line focuses mostly on Japanese street cars manufactured in the late 1970s and onwards, but movie and TV drama vehicles and special race cars have also been introduced. Examples are cars from 80s police dramas such as ''[[Seibu Keisatsu]]'' and ''[[Abunai Deka]]'' or the [[Japanese Touring Car Championship|JGTC]] Super Silhouette Skyline. Export versions of cars are also included, such as an American [[Datsun 510]] instead of a Japanese [[Nissan Bluebird]].\n\n=== Special Character Cars ===\n[[File:Character Tomica.jpg|thumb|A Snoopy family car and a Mickey Mouse car based on regular Tomica Datsun No.1]]\n\nIn the early years, Tomy produced cars with famous characters sitting on them, using the same castings from the regular Tomica line. The first of such was the Snoopy character cars from the 1970s. Tomy did not market and distribute these cars. Rather, they produced these for Aviva, who sold the toy under the Aviva brand name. In the early 1980s Tomy produced models with Muppet characters. Also in the 1980s, Tomy started producing vehicles with Disney characters under the Putica Disney series name. This popular series was made until the late 1990s and was also re-issued in the original style boxes sometime during the 2000s.\n\nCirca 1990s, when Tomy created a cartoon called \"Tomica Rescue\", it started another series using regular Tomica models and some [[Matchbox (brand)|Matchbox]] models with some add-ons such as cannons, armors and water hoses. In 1996, a series specially designed for the Japanese comic or cartoon \"Bakuso Kyodai Let's & Go !!\" (\u7206\u8d70\u5144\u5f1f\u30ec\u30c3\u30c4&\u30b4\u30fc) was initiated. Then came the \"Mach Go Go Go\" (\"\u30de\u30c3\u30cf\uff27\uff4f\uff27\uff4f\uff27\uff4f\", localized as \"Speed Racer\" in the West) series in 1998. In 2002 a series called Magnum Rescue was launched, and designed very much like today's Tomica Hyper Series. Unfortunately, due to safety issues, the Magnum Rescue Police Cruiser was recalled soon after its release.\n\nIn 2005, to celebrate the 60th Anniversary of the renowned [[Thomas and Friends]], Tomy started a Thomas the Tank Engine series. In recent years, Tomy has greatly expanded their specialized character Tomica series. Offerings include \"Tomica Hyper Series\", the [[Cars (franchise)|Cars (Disney/Pixar animation)]] series, [[Pok\u00e9mon]], [[Ridge Racer (series)|Ridge Racer]], the Disney Motors series, and racing anime and manga, such as [[Initial D]] and [[Circuit no \u014ckami]].\n\n== Rubber Problems ==\n\nSimilar to many older rubber toys, Tomica has had some problems over the years with rubber parts becoming brittle and breaking into pieces. For example, this occurs with the rubber track on excavator and bulldozer models bulldozer where the tracks break from aging (mostly on the 'made in Japan' ones).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Corgi Classics Limited]]\n* [[Dot-S]]\n* [[Hot Wheels]]\n* [[Maisto]]\n* [[Majorette (toy manufacturer)|Majorette]]\n* [[Matchbox (brand)|Matchbox]]\n* [[Playart]]\n* [[Siku Toys|Siku]]\n* [[Micro Machines]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\nAbout Tomica.  2013.

Ostensibly, Tomica diecast were an outgrowth of Tomica World, an autonomous toy line of motorized [[train]] accessories that Tomy had created based on [[Plarail]] and produced since 1959 (About Tomica 2013). Similar in concept, Tomica can be thought of as the [[Matchbox (brand)|Matchbox]] of Japan - but focuses mainly on Japanese brands.\n\n== History ==\nTomy Co. of Japan was founded in 1924 by Eijira Tomiyama in Tokyo (Robinson 2010). The company has produced a variety of toys, but in 1970 started production of the Tomica line of diecast vehicles as a result of the surge of interest in the global market in toy cars which was led mainly by Matchbox and Mattel's Hot Wheels (About Tomica 2013). Although models of various scales have been made, the name \"Tomica\" normally refers to the 3-inch sized mainstream vehicles most commonly produced by the company. Originally, the name \"Pocket Cars\" was given to Tomicas sold in the 1970s in the United States.  After four decades, Tomy Corporation again entered the North American and European markets with the Tomica name in 2010.\n\n[[File:Tomica 45 1.jpg|left|thumb|\"Black box\" Tomica from the 1980s of a Suzuki Carry noodle service truck.]]\n\n== Typical Tomicas ==\n=== Tomica Domestic Series (\"Black Box\" / \"Red & White Box\") ===\nInitially, Tomica only produced Japanese brand cars and trucks. This started with the release of six models in 1970. The seventh was issued later in the year. From that time, the Tomica line grew until there was a total of 109 concurrent models by 1978 \u2014 number 1 through 108 and also number 110 (109 was proposed, but never released). The variety of models also expanded from the initial [[coup\u00e9]]s and [[Sedan (automobile)|sedans]] to [[taxicab|taxis]], [[bus]]es, trucks, construction and other commercial vehicles. Even a [[steam engine]] and an ocean liner were offered. As new models were issued, each was assigned a number up to 110, replacing an existing model.\n\n[[File:Tomica 63 1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|\"Pocket Cars\" packaging was for the North American market.]]\n\nIn the early 1980s, Tomy experienced financial difficulties, and in 1983 the domestic model line was reduced to only 80 models (nos. 1 \u2013 80). These models were mainly packaged in picture boxes that had black background with yellow flaps. Later, new models came in a box with a red and white background (Rixon 2005, 99). Existing models issued before 1984 kept using the older style box with black background until 1988, when all boxes were updated to the new style. Hence, domestic models are commonly referred to as the \"black box\" or \"red and white Box\" models.\n\n=== Tomica Foreign Series (\"Blue & White Box\" / \"Pocket Cars\") ===\nTo compete in the global toy car market, Tomy early on, had plans of exporting its models. This was done starting in 1974 with the appearance of \"Tomy Pocket Cars\" in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. The marketing ploy was a blister package designed like a denim jeans 'pocket' with yellow 'stitching' around the outside of the card and the vehicle. Since Japanese cars were not yet booming sellers overseas, in 1976 Tomy started producing 'foreign' (non-Japanese) models. Present were [[United States|American]], [[Germany|German]], [[Italy|Italian]], [[United Kingdom|British]], and [[France|French]] cars, among others, making the Tomica product line more global.\n\nPartly because Pocket Cars were more expensive than Hot Wheels or Matchboxes in the American market, this blister pack series was not seen much after 1979 (Johnson 1998, 233). Tomica continued successfully, however, in the home market, where each foreign car was packaged in a picture box that showed a [[flag]] of the country of origin of that particular car. The boxes often did not show the number of the car, but it could be seen on the base. Since these boxes have the base colors of blue and white, they are also called the \"blue-and-white box\" models. At any one time, a total of 70 models were produced under the foreign line, numbered F1 to F70.\n\n[[File:Daihatsumidget.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A Bajaj / Diahatsu Midget 3 wheeled delivery truck of the ubiquitous type. A very authentic Asian Tomica rendering.]]\n\nThese cars from the 1970s and 1980s hold their value well. {{as of|2019}} they sell for between $15 and $20 US on eBay and other on-line sales sites. Perhaps because of their greater scarcity as well as realism, these values hold up much better than most Matchbox vehicles from the same time period.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\n=== Tomica Common Series (\"Red-and-White Box\") ===\n[[File:Tomica Heaven (3776703008).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Common series sales shelf in Japan.]]\n\nIn 1988, Tomy combined its foreign models into the domestic series. Most of the first 40 models from the foreign series were added to the 80 domestic models. Those foreign models that got transferred were assigned a number that was its F series number plus 80. A handful of these foreign models were discontinued after a few months\u2019 appearance under the new line. Overall about half of them had been discontinued after two years.\n\n=== Tomica Limited Series ===\nFrom 2001 to 2013, Tomy produced the TL series targeted for the collector. These models are made with higher details, and one of their biggest features is realistic-looking wheels with rubberized plastic tires. Although many of them are based on existing or discontinued regular Tomica models, some are new castings made exclusively for the TL line, namely, Nissan Skyline GTB, Toyoda AA, and new [[Mini Hatch|MINI Cooper]]. In the case of the new MINI Cooper, the model was first released for the TL series in 2004 but in 2006 included in the regular line as no. 43. Model numbers started at 0001. Each model is produced for a limited period of time, so models with smaller numbers are discontinued while new models with higher numbers continue to appear. These models are packaged in open cardboard boxes surrounded on four sides with a transparent plastic sleeve.\n\n=== Special, Promotional and Event models ===\n[[File:Tomica subary legacy.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The original promotional model issue of the Subaru Legacy Touring Wagon (right) and its regular model issue.]]\n\nTomica has produced a number of special models over the years. These are unique models that are not found in the regular line or the Limited Series. There are four types of special model:\n*An existing regular model with small modifications or additions of accessories. These can be in the form of TEM (Tomica Event Models, Tomica shop exclusives, as well as gift/box sets.\n*A truck model that shares the cab and the chassis of an existing model. These are also common for gift sets although also found as stand-alone models.\n*A model that is based on an existing model but has the major car body modified. Examples are:\n** [[Honda S800|Honda S800M]] Convertible modified from no. 23 Honda S800M\n** [[Mitsubishi Pajero]] Rally Type was modified from no. 30 Mitsubishi Pajero Metal Top. This model was produced for the [[Ralliart]] Team Set.\n** [[Toyota AE86|Toyota Sprinter Trueno AE-86 Hatchback]], modified from no. 78 [[Toyota Sprinter]] Trueno Coupe. This was produced for the [[Initial D]] Set.\n*A totally new casting. All of these had been produced under the contract of another model company or another business. Their common fate is that Tomy eventually issues them as regular models. Examples include:\n** [[Nissan Skyline]] GT-R R33 Racing Type (issued as no. 40 in 1997)\n** [[Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution]] IV (issued as no. 104 in 2000)\n** [[Mitsubishi Fuso Canter|Mitsubishi New Canter Panel Truck]] (issued as no. 29 in 2003)\n** [[Subaru Legacy]] Touring Wagon (issued as no. 11 in 2003)\n** [[Hummer H2]] (issued as no. 15 in 2007)\n** [[Nissan Laurel]] (issued as no. LV-52 in 2007)\n** [[Isuzu Giga]] (issued as no. 76 in 2007)\n* Also, in 2004, no. 121 was available for a limited period from Mitsuoka Motors. This was a 1/1 scale electric single seater vehicle which featured a retro Citroen H Van front end and side panels.\n\n=== Japan, China, Hong Kong, Thailand, and Vietnam Castings ===\nUntil 1993, Tomica models were almost exclusively produced by Tomy in their local factory in [[Tokyo]], Japan. However, since the early years, Tomy had outsourced some production to another country with cheaper labor cost. By mid-2003, all production were outsourced and Tomy no longer produced any Tomica in their own factory.\n\n[[Hong Kong]] was the first place outside of Japan where Tomica cars were produced. The production in Hong Kong only lasted a few years. Six models issued in 1971 and 1972 were made in Hong Kong:\n*1971 - No.10 [[Honda N360]]\n*1971 - No.11 Toyota Sprinter\n*1971 - No.12 [[Mazda Capella]] Rotary Coupe\n*1972 - No.30 [[Mitsubishi Galant]]\n*1972 - No.33 [[Nissan Cedric]]\n*1972 - No.42 [[Datsun]] 1300 Pick-Up\n\n[[File:Tomica Baseplates.jpg|left|thumb|The first decade of the 21st century saw the most variations in country of production of Tomica. From top to bottom: Thailand 2010, China 2006, Japan 2003, Vietnam 2009]]\n\nLimited production in [[China]] started in 1990 with a few existing models in the regular line, like the no. 35 DOME Toyota Celica and no. 73 Isuzu Dump. Large scale production in China started in 1993 with the \"British Line\" of 36 models that Tomy Company of UK contracted Tomy of Japan to produce by using existing tooling. As a result, regular models of the same castings were also made in China beginning in 1993. Starting in 1994, all the new models in the regular line were made in China, and in May 1995, the production of existing models started to move to China as well. This was done in phases. By July 1997, all regular line Tomica cars were made in China. There were a few exceptions to this rule: \n\n*No. 9 [[Komatsu Limited|Komatsu]] Power Shovel PC200, issued in 1995, was made in Japan because the model was already planned in 1994 and also because it shared components with the older no. 9. Production was moved to China when the model was produced for a gift set later in 1995.\n*No. 20 Nissan Skyline GT-R R33, issued in 1995, was made in Japan because the model was also used for special releases under the contract of II ADO, a popular chain of minicar shops in [[Japan]]. Production was moved to China in 1997 along with others during the last phase of moving.\n*No. 30 Mitsubishi Pajero, issued in 1999, was made in Japan because the model was concurrently issued as a special promotional model for Mitsubishi Motors in Japan. Production moved to China after two months, when the promotion stopped.\n*No. 105 [[Coca-Cola]] Route Truck, issued in 1996, was made in Japan as well. However, this model was simply a different colour and livery on an existing casting, so it was not truly a new model.\n\nWhile production in Japan ceased in 1997 for the regular models, Tomy kept producing special models in Japan until 2003, using old castings not used for mass production of the British line, regular models, or gift sets.  Because these older castings had remained in Japan, special releases and promotional issues using these older castings were still made in Japan. New castings for special models were also made in Japan. The Subaru Legacy from 2003 was the last Tomica ever produced in Japan.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nProduction of Tomicas started to move to [[Vietnam]] in early 2009. This was also done in phases and took several years. Unlike the move from Japan to China during which no new regular models were made in Japan (besides the few exceptions), during this time new releases came from both Vietnam and China until 2013.\n\nIn 2010, when Technology Tomica was introduced, they were initially made in [[Thailand]]. In 2012, production moved to Vietnam.\n\n=== Wheel styles ===\n[[File:Tomy trucking a.jpg|right|thumb|A Toyota Hiace from the 1970s with older 2-piece wheels.]]\n[[File:TomicaMorganPlusEight.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A Morgan Plus Eight. Note the typical five studded wheel style.]]\n\nThe earliest Tomica cars had one-piece [[Chrome plating|chrome-plated]] wheels. Starting in 1971, models were produced with two-piece wheels of various styles, with the one-piece chrome-plated wheels being phased out in 1972 (except that all the models made in Hong Kong had the one-piece wheel design). The two-piece wheels were used until 1977, while newer one-piece wheels of various styles have been adopted since 1976, and are still used today.\n\nThe most common design is a five-spoke chrome on black plastic form that appears to have five (four before 2007) 'studs' around the edge of the wheel (It is commonly referred to as the 4/5 studded wheel). This design has even been continued with the newer vehicles made in Vietnam. Another common style is a black plastic wheel with a single chrome ring and no other outstanding detail (This is also refers to the racing wheels) . Later Tomicas have a slightly redesigned wheel design, with the 'studs' slightly smaller. Some SUVs (e.g. Nissan X-Trail, Mitsubishi Pajero) have a 4-spoke chrome with grooves on the outside.\n\n== Other Series ==\n\n=== Long Tomica ===\n[[File:Long Tomica.jpg|right|thumb|New long vehicles from the Tomica regular line are a bit smaller than the original Long Tomicas.]]\n\nLonger buses and semi-trailer trucks were models not suitable for the regular small boxes, so Tomy also started the \"Long Tomica\" series in 1977. Castings such as trucks, articulated buses or Shinkansen trains were produced as single models until 1993. However, some of these long models still appeared in gift sets after 1993, such as the JAL Airport Vehicles Set. Many of these were specifically for foreign markets, like the Trathen's Skyliner bus which made the Plymouth to London trek in the U.K. (Rixon 2005, 102). Beginning in 2009, Tomy produces newer versions of \"Long Tomica\", such as the newest Shinkansen trains or large semi trailer trucks, as part of the regular series under model numbers 121 to 140. \n\n=== Combat Tomica ===\nEarlier, Tomy produced the 1/87 diecast Combat Tomica series. The line started with the model M-60 U.S. Army Medium Tank, and later on, models such as the U.S. M-60A-1E-1, the German TIGER-I, the Japanese Type 61 and the Russian SU-85 were produced. There were two types of Combat Tomica but they both contained exactly the same models. The first one was like regular Tomica models; the models came in a paper box, there were some soldier figures for decoration and a set of wheels because the tracks were fixed and did not actually function. The second type was the metal model kits that required manual assembly. These came in larger boxes inside containing the parts for assembly. Production of the Combat Tomicas lasted only a few years, however Tomy continued producing military vehicles such as rocket launcher trucks, troop trucks, and jeeps, for its regular \"3-inch\" line-up.\n\n=== Tomica Dandy ===\n[[File:Tomica Dandy.jpg|left|thumb|Tomica Dandy Nissan Bluebird in 1/35, one of the larger scale. Most cars were 1/43.]]\n\nTomica Dandy cars are larger - about 1:43 scale and were produced from 1972 until 1993. At first they were all Japanese domestic models, but similar to the common Tomicas, the Dandy line also began to offer foreign brand vehicles in 1977 (for example, a Lotus Europa). The numbering system was changed in 1984 based on the nature of the vehicles (e.g. [[emergency vehicle|emergency]], [[police]], or foreign models). In 2001, Tomy reissued six Tomica Dandy models in limited quantities.\n\nDandys were diecast metal and most also had metal bases. Wheels looked authentic, but were hard black plastic and not rubber, which was normal for 1:43 diecast cars in the 1980s. Some Dandy cars had special features like the Mazda Savanna with \"pop-up\" headlights operated from a lever ''inside the car'' (Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, 77). Packaging colors varied and some were promotional models, but commonly, boxes were blue or red showing a perforated license plate shape with 'Dandy' written on the plate. Tomica Dandy castings have also been used in gift sets and the Limited S Series, but these models have the \"Dandy\" name on their base plates removed.\n\n\n=== Motorized Tomica ===\n[[File:Motorized Tomica.jpg|right|thumb|B/O Tomica came in a picture box while the later Motor Tomica came in a window box.]]\n\nTomy started producing motorized cars in the late 1970s beginning with the Power Tomica series. This series did not last long. In 1992, it released a new series called B/O Tomica (stands for [[battery (electricity)|battery]]-operated Tomica). This series was renamed Motor Tomica in 1997. They were produced and sold as single models until 2003. All the B/O Tomica are made in Japan, while all the Motor Tomica (including the Animated Motor Tomica) are made in China. To fit on the motorized base, these castings often have altered scales. In general, sport utility vehicles appear in their proper scales, saloons appear a bit bulky, and buses and lorries are disproportionately short. In 2005, a new series for motorized Tomica was released containing generic vehicles such as a police patrol car. This late series targets toddlers and is made of ABS plastic.\n\n=== Pullback Tomica ===\nThese first appeared in the 1980s and there were six models at that time. In the year 2002, Tomy again produced [[pullback motor|pullback]] models.\n\n=== Sound and Light Tomica ===\n[[File:Sound Tomica.jpg|left|thumb|Left: Sound Tomica from 1992. Right: Technology Tomica from 2011.]]\n\nFrom time to time, Tomy produces shorter runs of cars with sound or light or both, based on castings from the regular series. The first of such series was the Sound Tomica, introduced in 1992. These cars have both sound and light. Upon pressing one set of wheels, the sound and light are activated for a short time. The Siren Tomica series from 1996 replaced Sound Tomica. These are basically the same design except the batteries can be taken out and replaced. In 2000, Tomy came out with the Chat Tomica line. These cars do not have light, but depending on the model, upon activation, \"[t]hree types of recorded clips will be played (including the sound of sirens, voices and cries of animals).\" (T3: Sound of Tomicas 2008). Conversely, the Technology Tomica cars introduced in 2010 only have lights. What is special is that they do not require batteries. Rolling the cars produces the electricity to power the lights. This line also represents the only made-in-Thailand Tomica in existence to date. Most recently, Tomy has released the Tomica 4D line. These cars have engine sounds and vibrations.\n\n=== Tomica Limited Vintage ===\nStarting from 2004, Tomytec, a branch of Tomy, started producing realistic models - more for the collector market. They are marketed as the Tomica Limited Vintage Tomytec series and are mostly 1950s and 1960s classic Japanese vehicles such as the Honda S800, Nissan Cedric, Prince Gloria and Toyopet Crown. More details are evident on these compared to the regular Tomica models or even the Tomica Limited models.\n\nIn 2006 the Tomica Limited Vintage - Neo [TLV-N] line was created and currently includes vehicles from the 1970s and 1980s. As with the Limited Vintage series, the focus of the Limited Vintage - Neo series is on adult collectors. These models have a high level of realism, with more attention to details such as wheels, tires, paint, trim and emblems versus functions like opening parts or moving features but still has the suspension of the basic Tomica models. All the models are a consistent scale of 1/64 (Tomica Fan Club).\n\nThe Tomica Limited Vintage Neo line focuses mostly on Japanese street cars manufactured in the late 1970s and onwards, but movie and TV drama vehicles and special race cars have also been introduced. Examples are cars from 80s police dramas such as ''[[Seibu Keisatsu]]'' and ''[[Abunai Deka]]'' or the [[Japanese Touring Car Championship|JGTC]] Super Silhouette Skyline. Export versions of cars are also included, such as an American [[Datsun 510]] instead of a Japanese [[Nissan Bluebird]].\n\n=== Special Character Cars ===\n[[File:Character Tomica.jpg|thumb|A Snoopy family car and a Mickey Mouse car based on regular Tomica Datsun No.1]]\n\nIn the early years, Tomy produced cars with famous characters sitting on them, using the same castings from the regular Tomica line. The first of such was the Snoopy character cars from the 1970s. Tomy did not market and distribute these cars. Rather, they produced these for Aviva, who sold the toy under the Aviva brand name. In the early 1980s Tomy produced models with Muppet characters. Also in the 1980s, Tomy started producing vehicles with Disney characters under the Putica Disney series name. This popular series was made until the late 1990s and was also re-issued in the original style boxes sometime during the 2000's.\n\nCirca 1990s, when Tomy created a cartoon called \"Tomica Rescue\", it started another series using regular Tomica models and some [[Matchbox (brand)|Matchbox]] models with some add-ons such as cannons, armors and water hoses. In 1996, a series specially designed for the Japanese comic or cartoon \"Bakuso Kyodai Let's & Go !!\" (\u7206\u8d70\u5144\u5f1f\u30ec\u30c3\u30c4&\u30b4\u30fc) was initiated. Then came the \"Mach Go Go Go\" (\"\u30de\u30c3\u30cf\uff27\uff4f\uff27\uff4f\uff27\uff4f\", localized as \"Speed Racer\" in the West) series in 1998. In 2002 a series called Magnum Rescue was launched, and designed very much like today's Tomica Hyper Series. Unfortunately, due to safety issues, the Magnum Rescue Police Cruiser was recalled soon after its release.\n\nIn 2005, to celebrate the 60th Anniversary of the renowned [[Thomas and Friends]], Tomy started a Thomas the Tank Engine series. In recent years, Tomy has greatly expanded their specialized character Tomica series. Offerings include \"Tomica Hyper Series\", the [[Cars (franchise)|Cars (Disney/Pixar animation)]] series, [[Pok\u00e9mon]], [[Ridge Racer (series)|Ridge Racer]], the Disney Motors series, and racing anime and manga, such as [[Initial D]] and [[Circuit no \u014ckami]].\n\n== Rubber Problems ==\n\nSimilar to many older rubber toys, Tomica has had some problems over the years with rubber parts becoming brittle and breaking into pieces. For example, this occurs with the rubber track on excavator and bulldozer models bulldozer where the tracks break from aging (mostly on the 'made in Japan' ones).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Corgi Classics Limited]]\n* [[Dot-S]]\n* [[Hot Wheels]]\n* [[Maisto]]\n* [[Majorette (toy manufacturer)|Majorette]]\n* [[Matchbox (brand)|Matchbox]]\n* [[Playart]]\n* [[Siku Toys|Siku]]\n* [[Micro Machines]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\nAbout Tomica.  2013.

Many of the letterforms differed from those of modern Cyrillic, varied a great deal in [[manuscript]]s, and changed over time. Few fonts include [[glyph]]s sufficient to reproduce the alphabet. In accordance with [[Unicode]] policy, the standard does not include letterform variations or [[Ligature (typography)|ligatures]] found in manuscript sources unless they can be shown to conform to the Unicode definition of a character.\n\nThe Unicode 5.1 standard, released on 4 April 2008, greatly improves computer support for the early Cyrillic and the modern [[Church Slavonic]] language. In Microsoft Windows, the [[Segoe UI]] user interface font is notable for having complete support for the archaic Cyrillic letters since Windows 8.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Unicode\" style=\"vertical-align:top;

Late Medieval Cyrillic letters (still found on many [[icon]] inscriptions today) show a marked tendency to be very tall and narrow, with strokes often shared between adjacent letters.\n\n[[Peter the Great]], Tsar of Russia, mandated the use of [[Civil script|westernized letter forms]] ([[:ru:\u0413\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0448\u0440\u0438\u0444\u0442|ru]]) in the early 18th century. Over time, these were largely adopted in the other languages that use the script. Thus, unlike the majority of modern Greek fonts that retained their own set of design principles for lower-case letters (such as the placement of [[serif]]s, the shapes of stroke ends, and stroke-thickness rules, although Greek capital letters do use Latin design principles), modern Cyrillic fonts are much the same as modern Latin fonts of the same font family. The development of some Cyrillic computer typefaces from Latin ones has also contributed to the visual Latinization of Cyrillic type.\n\n[[File:Cyrillic upright-cursive-n.svg|frame|right|Letters Ge, De, I, I kratkoye, Me, Te, Tse, Be and Ve in upright (printed) and cursive (handwritten) variants. (Top is set in Georgia font, bottom in Odessa Script.)]]\nCyrillic [[capital letters|uppercase]] and [[lower case|lowercase]] letter forms are not as differentiated as in Latin typography. Upright Cyrillic lowercase letters are essentially [[small caps|small capitals]] (with exceptions: Cyrillic {{angle bracket|\u0430}}, {{angle bracket|\u0435}}, {{angle bracket|\u0456}}, {{angle bracket|\u0458}}, {{angle bracket|\u0440}}, and {{angle bracket|\u0443}} adopted Western lowercase shapes, lowercase {{angle bracket|\u0444}} is typically designed under the influence of Latin {{angle bracket|p}}, lowercase {{angle bracket|\u0431}}, {{angle bracket|\u0452}} and {{angle bracket|\u045b}} are traditional handwritten forms), although a good-quality Cyrillic typeface will still include separate small-caps glyphs.<ref>Bringhurst (2002) writes \"in Cyrillic, the difference between normal lower case and small caps is more subtle than it is in the Latin or Greek alphabets,{{nbsp}}...\" (p 32) and \"in most Cyrillic faces, the lower case is close in color and shape to Latin small caps\" (p 107).</ref>\n\nCyrillic fonts, as well as Latin ones, have [[roman type|roman]] and [[italic type|italic]] types (practically all popular modern fonts include parallel sets of Latin and Cyrillic letters, where many glyphs, uppercase as well as lowercase, are simply shared by both). However, the native font terminology in most Slavic languages (for example, in Russian) does not use the words \"roman\" and \"italic\" in this sense.<ref>Name ''{{lang|ru-Latn|ital'yanskiy shrift}}'' (Italian font) in Russian refers to a particular font family [http://citforum.univ.kiev.ua/open_source/fonts/theory/thumbs/ris320.jpg JPG] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926182512/http://citforum.univ.kiev.ua/open_source/fonts/theory/thumbs/ris320.jpg |date=26 September 2007 }}, whereas ''{{lang|ru-Latn|rimskiy shrift}}'' (roman font) is just a synonym for Latin font, Latin alphabet.</ref> Instead, the nomenclature follows German naming patterns:\n\n[[File:Cyrillic cursive.svg|thumb|Cyrillic letters in cursive]]\n*Roman type is called ''{{lang|ru-Latn|pryamoy shrift}}'' (\"upright type\")\u2014compare with ''{{lang|de|Normalschrift}}'' (\"regular type\") in German\n*Italic type is called ''{{lang|ru-Latn|kursiv}}'' (\"cursive\") or ''{{lang|ru-Latn|kursivniy shrift}}'' (\"cursive type\")\u2014from the German word ''{{lang|de|Kursive}}'', meaning italic typefaces and not cursive writing\n*[[Cursive]] handwriting is ''{{lang|ru-Latn|rukopisniy shrift}}'' (\"handwritten type\") in Russian\u2014in German: ''{{lang|de|[[:de:Kurrentschrift|Kurrentschrift]]}}'' or ''{{lang|de|Laufschrift}}'', both meaning literally 'running type'\n\nAs in Latin typography, a [[sans-serif]] face may have a mechanically sloped oblique type (''{{lang|ru-Latn|naklonniy shrift}}''\u2014\"sloped\", or \"slanted type\") instead of italic.\n\nSimilarly to Latin fonts, italic and cursive types of many Cyrillic letters (typically lowercase; uppercase only for handwritten or stylish types) are very different from their upright roman types. In certain cases, the correspondence between uppercase and lowercase glyphs does not coincide in Latin and Cyrillic fonts: for example, italic Cyrillic <span style=\"font-family: times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: larger\">{{angle bracket|''\u0442''}}</span> is the lowercase counterpart of {{angle bracket|''\u0422''}} not of {{angle bracket|''\u041c''}}.\n\nA boldfaced type is called ''{{lang|ru-Latn|poluzhirniy shrift}}'' (\"semi-bold type\"), because there existed fully boldfaced shapes that have been out of use since the beginning of the 20th century. A bold italic combination (bold slanted) does not exist for all font families.\n\nIn Standard Serbian, as well as in Macedonian,<ref>{{cite book |title=Pravopis na makedonskiot jazik |date=2017 |publisher=Institut za makedonski jazik Krste Misirkov |location=Skopje |isbn=978-608-220-042-2 |page=3 |url=http://www.pravopis.mk/sites/default/files/Pravopis-2017.PDF |ref=MakedonskiPravopis}}</ref> some italic and cursive letters are allowed to be different to resemble more to the handwritten letters.

Other Cyrillic alphabets include the [[Molodtsov alphabet]] for the Komi language and various alphabets for [[Caucasian languages]].\n\n==Name==\n[[File:Cyrillic monument.jpg|thumb|165px|Cyrillic Script Monument in [[Antarctica]]]]\nSince the script was conceived and popularised by the followers of [[Cyril and Methodius]], rather than by Cyril and Methodius themselves, its name denotes homage rather than authorship. The name \"Cyrillic\" often confuses people who are not familiar with the script's history, because it does not identify a country of origin (in contrast to the \"Greek alphabet\"). Among the general public, it is often called \"the Russian alphabet,\" because Russian is the most popular and influential alphabet based on the script. Some Bulgarian intellectuals, notably [[Stefan Tsanev]], have expressed concern over this, and have suggested that the Cyrillic script be called the \"Bulgarian alphabet\" instead, for the sake of historical accuracy.<ref>Tsanev, Stefan. ''\u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0445\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438, \u0442\u043e\u043c 4 (Bulgarian Chronicles, Volume 4)'', Sofia, 2009, p. 165</ref> It must be noted here that 'alphabet' is not the same as 'script' (e.g. letter \u0407\u0457 exists in the Cyrillic script since its very invention and is still used in Ukrainian, but is absent in the modern Bulgarian alphabet, that is Cyrillic as used in Bulgarian), so the accurate name is actually 'the Bulgarian script'.\n\nIn Bulgarian, Macedonian, Russian, and Serbian, the Cyrillic alphabet is also known as ''azbuka'', derived from the old names of the first two letters of most Cyrillic alphabets (just as the term ''alphabet'' came from the first two Greek letters ''alpha'' and ''beta''). In the Russian language [[Syllabary|syllabaries]], especially the Japanese [[kana]], are commonly referred to as 'syllabic azbukas' rather than 'syllabic scripts'.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Early Cyrillic alphabet}}\n[[File:Azbuka 1574 by Ivan Fyodorov.png|thumb|left|upright=1.1|A page from \u0410\u0437\u0431\u0443\u043a\u0430 (\u0427\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0430) (ABC (Reader)), the first Ruthenian language textbook, printed by [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fyodorov]] in 1574.

Hence expressions such as \"\u0418 is the tenth Cyrillic letter\" typically refer to the order of the Church Slavonic alphabet; not every Cyrillic alphabet uses every letter available in the script.\n\nThe Cyrillic script came to dominate Glagolitic in the 12th century. The literature produced in the Old Bulgarian language soon spread north and became the [[lingua franca]] of the Balkans and Eastern Europe, where it came to also be known as [[Old Church Slavonic]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"On the relationship of old Church Slavonic to the written language of early Rus'\" Horace G.

Fortson. ''Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction'', p. 374</ref> The alphabet used for the modern [[Church Slavonic language]] in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic]] rites still resembles early Cyrillic. However, over the course of the following millennium, Cyrillic adapted to changes in spoken language, developed regional variations to suit the features of national languages, and was subjected to academic reform and political decrees. A notable example of such linguistic reform can be attributed to [[Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107|Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107]] who updated the [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet]] by removing certain graphemes no longer represented in the vernacular, and introducing graphemes specific to Serbian (i.e. \u0409 \u040a \u0402 \u040b \u040f \u0408), distancing it from Church Slavonic alphabet in use prior to the reform. Today, [[Languages using Cyrillic|many languages]] in the [[Languages of the Balkans|Balkans]], Eastern Europe, and [[Eurasiatic languages|northern Eurasia]] are written in Cyrillic alphabets.\n\n==Relationship to other writing systems==\n===Latin script===\nA number of languages written in a Cyrillic alphabet have also been written in a [[Latin alphabet]], such as [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Romanian Language|Romanian]] (in the [[Republic of Moldova]] until 1989, in [[Romania]] throughout the 19th century). After the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991, some of the former republics officially shifted from Cyrillic to Latin. The transition is complete in most of Moldova (except the breakaway region of [[Transnistria]], where [[Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet|Moldovan Cyrillic]] is official), [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Azerbaijan]]. [[Uzbekistan]] still uses both systems, and [[Kazakhstan]] has officially begun a transition from Cyrillic to Latin (scheduled to be complete by 2025). The [[Russia]]n government has mandated that Cyrillic must be used for all public communications in all [[federal subjects of Russia]], to promote closer ties across the federation.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} This act was controversial for speakers of many Slavic languages; for others, such as [[Chechen language|Chechen]] and [[Ingush language|Ingush]] speakers, the law had political ramifications. For example, the separatist Chechen government mandated a Latin script which is still used by many Chechens. Those in the diaspora especially refuse to use the Chechen Cyrillic alphabet, which they associate with Russian imperialism.\n\n[[File:Cyrillic alphabet world distribution.svg|thumb|upright=2|Distribution of the Cyrillic script worldwide:<br>\n{{legend|#0b280b|Cyrillic is the sole official script.}}\n{{legend|#217821|Cyrillic is co-official with another alphabet.

Modern scholars believe that Cyrillic was developed and formalized by the early disciples of Cyril and Methodius, particularly by [[Clement of Ohrid]].\n\nIn the early 18th century, the Cyrillic script used in Russia was heavily reformed by [[Peter the Great]], who had recently returned from his [[Grand Embassy of Peter the Great|Grand Embassy]] in [[western Europe]]. The new letterforms became closer to those of the Latin alphabet; several archaic letters were removed and several letters were personally designed by Peter the Great.

Many of the letterforms differed from those of modern Cyrillic, varied a great deal in [[manuscript]]s, and changed over time. Few fonts include [[glyph]]s sufficient to reproduce the alphabet. In accordance with [[Unicode]] policy, the standard does not include letterform variations or [[Ligature (typography)|ligatures]] found in manuscript sources unless they can be shown to conform to the Unicode definition of a character.\n\nThe Unicode 5.1 standard, released on 4 April 2008, greatly improves computer support for the early Cyrillic and the modern [[Church Slavonic]] language. In Microsoft Windows, the [[Segoe UI]] user interface font is notable for having complete support for the archaic Cyrillic letters since Windows 8.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Unicode\" style=\"vertical-align:top;

Late Medieval Cyrillic letters (still found on many [[icon]] inscriptions today) show a marked tendency to be very tall and narrow, with strokes often shared between adjacent letters.\n\n[[Peter the Great]], Tsar of Russia, mandated the use of [[Civil script|westernized letter forms]] ([[:ru:\u0413\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0448\u0440\u0438\u0444\u0442|ru]]) in the early 18th century. Over time, these were largely adopted in the other languages that use the script. Thus, unlike the majority of modern Greek fonts that retained their own set of design principles for lower-case letters (such as the placement of [[serif]]s, the shapes of stroke ends, and stroke-thickness rules, although Greek capital letters do use Latin design principles), modern Cyrillic fonts are much the same as modern Latin fonts of the same font family. The development of some Cyrillic computer typefaces from Latin ones has also contributed to the visual Latinization of Cyrillic type.\n\n[[File:Cyrillic upright-cursive-n.svg|frame|right|Letters Ge, De, I, I kratkoye, Me, Te, Tse, Be and Ve in upright (printed) and cursive (handwritten) variants. (Top is set in Georgia font, bottom in Odessa Script.)]]\nCyrillic [[capital letters|uppercase]] and [[lower case|lowercase]] letter forms are not as differentiated as in Latin typography. Upright Cyrillic lowercase letters are essentially [[small caps|small capitals]] (with exceptions: Cyrillic {{angle bracket|\u0430}}, {{angle bracket|\u0435}}, {{angle bracket|\u0456}}, {{angle bracket|\u0458}}, {{angle bracket|\u0440}}, and {{angle bracket|\u0443}} adopted Western lowercase shapes, lowercase {{angle bracket|\u0444}} is typically designed under the influence of Latin {{angle bracket|p}}, lowercase {{angle bracket|\u0431}}, {{angle bracket|\u0452}} and {{angle bracket|\u045b}} are traditional handwritten forms), although a good-quality Cyrillic typeface will still include separate small-caps glyphs.<ref>Bringhurst (2002) writes \"in Cyrillic, the difference between normal lower case and small caps is more subtle than it is in the Latin or Greek alphabets,{{nbsp}}...\" (p 32) and \"in most Cyrillic faces, the lower case is close in color and shape to Latin small caps\" (p 107).</ref>\n\nCyrillic fonts, as well as Latin ones, have [[roman type|roman]] and [[italic type|italic]] types (practically all popular modern fonts include parallel sets of Latin and Cyrillic letters, where many glyphs, uppercase as well as lowercase, are simply shared by both). However, the native font terminology in most Slavic languages (for example, in Russian) does not use the words \"roman\" and \"italic\" in this sense.<ref>Name ''{{lang|ru-Latn|ital'yanskiy shrift}}'' (Italian font) in Russian refers to a particular font family [http://citforum.univ.kiev.ua/open_source/fonts/theory/thumbs/ris320.jpg JPG] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926182512/http://citforum.univ.kiev.ua/open_source/fonts/theory/thumbs/ris320.jpg |date=26 September 2007 }}, whereas ''{{lang|ru-Latn|rimskiy shrift}}'' (roman font) is just a synonym for Latin font, Latin alphabet.</ref> Instead, the nomenclature follows German naming patterns:\n\n[[File:Cyrillic cursive.svg|thumb|Cyrillic letters in cursive]]\n*Roman type is called ''{{lang|ru-Latn|pryamoy shrift}}'' (\"upright type\")\u2014compare with ''{{lang|de|Normalschrift}}'' (\"regular type\") in German\n*Italic type is called ''{{lang|ru-Latn|kursiv}}'' (\"cursive\") or ''{{lang|ru-Latn|kursivniy shrift}}'' (\"cursive type\")\u2014from the German word ''{{lang|de|Kursive}}'', meaning italic typefaces and not cursive writing\n*[[Cursive]] handwriting is ''{{lang|ru-Latn|rukopisniy shrift}}'' (\"handwritten type\") in Russian\u2014in German: ''{{lang|de|[[:de:Kurrentschrift|Kurrentschrift]]}}'' or ''{{lang|de|Laufschrift}}'', both meaning literally 'running type'\n\nAs in Latin typography, a [[sans-serif]] face may have a mechanically sloped oblique type (''{{lang|ru-Latn|naklonniy shrift}}''\u2014\"sloped\", or \"slanted type\") instead of italic.\n\nSimilarly to Latin fonts, italic and cursive types of many Cyrillic letters (typically lowercase; uppercase only for handwritten or stylish types) are very different from their upright roman types.

Other Cyrillic alphabets include the [[Molodtsov alphabet]] for the Komi language and various alphabets for [[Caucasian languages]].\n\n==Name==\n[[File:Cyrillic monument.jpg|thumb|165px|Cyrillic Script Monument in [[Antarctica]]]]\nSince the script was conceived and popularised by the followers of [[Cyril and Methodius]], rather than by Cyril and Methodius themselves, its name denotes homage rather than authorship. The name \"Cyrillic\" often confuses people who are not familiar with the script's history, because it does not identify a country of origin (in contrast to the \"Greek alphabet\"). Among the general public, it is often called \"the Russian alphabet,\" because Russian is the most popular and influential alphabet based on the script. Some Bulgarian intellectuals, notably [[Stefan Tsanev]], have expressed concern over this, and have suggested that the Cyrillic script be called the \"Bulgarian alphabet\" instead, for the sake of historical accuracy.<ref>Tsanev, Stefan. ''\u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0445\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438, \u0442\u043e\u043c 4 (Bulgarian Chronicles, Volume 4)'', Sofia, 2009, p. 165</ref> It must be noted here that 'alphabet' is not the same as 'script' (e.g. letter \u0407\u0457 exists in the Cyrillic script since its very invention and is still used in Ukrainian, but is absent in the modern Bulgarian alphabet, that is Cyrillic as used in Bulgarian), so the accurate name is actually 'the Bulgarian script'.\n\nIn Bulgarian, Macedonian, Russian, and Serbian, the Cyrillic alphabet is also known as ''azbuka'', derived from the old names of the first two letters of most Cyrillic alphabets (just as the term ''alphabet'' came from the first two Greek letters ''alpha'' and ''beta''). In the Russian language syllabaries, especially the Japanese [[kana]], are commonly referred to as 'syllabic azbukas' rather than 'syllabic scripts'.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Early Cyrillic alphabet}}\n[[File:Azbuka 1574 by Ivan Fyodorov.png|thumb|left|upright=1.1|A page from \u0410\u0437\u0431\u0443\u043a\u0430 (\u0427\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0430) (ABC (Reader)), the first Ruthenian language textbook, printed by [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fyodorov]] in 1574.

Hence expressions such as \"\u0418 is the tenth Cyrillic letter\" typically refer to the order of the Church Slavonic alphabet; not every Cyrillic alphabet uses every letter available in the script.\n\nThe Cyrillic script came to dominate Glagolitic in the 12th century. The literature produced in the Old Bulgarian language soon spread north and became the [[lingua franca]] of the Balkans and Eastern Europe, where it came to also be known as [[Old Church Slavonic]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"On the relationship of old Church Slavonic to the written language of early Rus'\" Horace G.

Fortson. ''Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction'', p. 374</ref> The alphabet used for the modern [[Church Slavonic language]] in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic]] rites still resembles early Cyrillic. However, over the course of the following millennium, Cyrillic adapted to changes in spoken language, developed regional variations to suit the features of national languages, and was subjected to academic reform and political decrees. A notable example of such linguistic reform can be attributed to [[Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107|Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107]] who updated the [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet]] by removing certain graphemes no longer represented in the vernacular, and introducing graphemes specific to Serbian (i.e. \u0409 \u040a \u0402 \u040b \u040f \u0408), distancing it from Church Slavonic alphabet in use prior to the reform. Today, [[Languages using Cyrillic|many languages]] in the [[Languages of the Balkans|Balkans]], Eastern Europe, and [[Eurasiatic languages|northern Eurasia]] are written in Cyrillic alphabets.\n\n==Relationship to other writing systems==\n===Latin script===\nA number of languages written in a Cyrillic alphabet have also been written in a [[Latin alphabet]], such as [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Romanian Language|Romanian]] (in the [[Republic of Moldova]] until 1989, in [[Romania]] throughout the 19th century). After the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991, some of the former republics officially shifted from Cyrillic to Latin. The transition is complete in most of Moldova (except the breakaway region of [[Transnistria]], where [[Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet|Moldovan Cyrillic]] is official), [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Azerbaijan]]. [[Uzbekistan]] still uses both systems, and [[Kazakhstan]] has officially begun a transition from Cyrillic to Latin (scheduled to be complete by 2025). The [[Russia]]n government has mandated that Cyrillic must be used for all public communications in all [[federal subjects of Russia]], to promote closer ties across the federation.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} This act was controversial for speakers of many Slavic languages; for others, such as [[Chechen language|Chechen]] and [[Ingush language|Ingush]] speakers, the law had political ramifications. For example, the separatist Chechen government mandated a Latin script which is still used by many Chechens. Those in the diaspora especially refuse to use the Chechen Cyrillic alphabet, which they associate with Russian imperialism.\n\n[[File:Cyrillic alphabet world distribution.svg|thumb|upright=2|Distribution of the Cyrillic script worldwide:<br>\n{{legend|#0b280b|Cyrillic is the sole official script.}}\n{{legend|#217821|Cyrillic is co-official with another alphabet.
