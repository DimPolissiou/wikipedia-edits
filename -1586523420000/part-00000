The story is a revenge tragedy.\n\n==Plot==\nMarcos, a young reporter, goes to a circus to write a Sunday supplement piece. As he is leaving, the next act is about to start. It involves a woman riding a horse and performing tricks; the presentation ends in shooting balloons from a horse while it is moving. Marcos is taken by the beauty of Ana, the equestrian sharpshooter, and returns to interview her. She invites him to dinner with the troupe. They dance, and then spend the night together. He falls in love with the beautiful horse-riding circus girl. An affair between them ensues; he considers following her around Europe and promises he would follow her to hell. Soon, Marco has to leave to cover a concert in [[Barcelona]]. \n\nFate intervenes when three young mechanics come to repair circus equipment and the owner gives them complimentary tickets for the show. The trio makes a racket as they watch Ana perform. After the show, they follow Ana to her trailer and brutally [[rape]] her. Although she is badly hurt, she decides to take matters into her own hands. Bruised, humiliated, and bleeding, she picks up her rifle and goes to hunt them down. She finds them easily at the mechanic shop where they work. She kills them all and leaves without being clearly identified. Ana, who is bleeding badly, has to visit a doctor who reveals to the authorities that she has been raped. The police initially have no clues about the culprit of the triple homicide, but after interviewing the doctor, they begin to suspect Ana. \n\nAna is stopped in a highway by two officers; she panics and kills them too, a decision that she regrets immediately. Marco who goes to Ana's trailer, finds traces of blood all over the place and he and the authorities go in search of Ana. She finds refuge in a country home where a couple and two small children live. Marcos is responsible for breaking the impasse between Ana and the police, but he arrives too late to help her; the police open fire on her, and she dies in his arms.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Francesca Neri]] as Ana\n*[[Antonio Banderas]] as Marcos\n*Eulalia Ramon as Lali\n*Coque Malla as rapist\n\n==Reception==\n[[TV Guide]] remarked in its 3/5 star review \"A well-acted revenge drama, [the film] seems rather anomalous to the career of acclaimed director Carlos Saura...

Originally called '''Seahawks Stadium''', it became '''Qwest Field''' in June 2004, when telecommunications carrier [[Qwest]] acquired the naming rights. It received its current name in June 2011 after Qwest's acquisition by [[CenturyLink]].<ref name=\"CenturyLinkNamingRights\">{{cite web |title=A New Chapter in the Legacy of Sports in Seattle Begins |url=http://www.seahawks.com/news/2011/06/23/new-chapter-legacy-sports%C2%A0-seattle-begins |publisher=Seattle Seahawks |date=June 23, 2011 |accessdate=October 10, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151209001057/http://www.seahawks.com/news/2011/06/23/new-chapter-legacy-sports%C2%A0-seattle-begins |archivedate=December 9, 2015}}</ref> It is a modern facility with views of the [[Downtown Seattle]] skyline and can seat 68,740&nbsp;people for NFL games and 37,722 for most MLS matches and XFL games. The complex also includes the Event Center with the Washington Music Theater (WaMu Theater), a parking garage, and a public plaza. The venue hosts concerts, trade shows, and consumer shows along with sporting events. Located within a mile&nbsp;(1.6&nbsp;km) of Downtown Seattle, the stadium is accessible by multiple freeways and forms of mass transit.\n\nThe stadium was built between 2000 and 2002 on the site of the [[Kingdome]] after voters approved funding for the construction in a statewide election held in June 1997. This vote created the [[Washington State Public Stadium Authority]] to oversee public ownership of the venue. The owner of the Seahawks, [[Paul Allen]], formed First & Goal Inc. to develop and operate the new facilities. Allen was closely involved in the design process and emphasized the importance of an open-air venue with an intimate atmosphere.\n\nThe crowd is notoriously loud during Seahawks games. It has twice held the [[Guinness World Record]] for loudest crowd roar at an outdoor stadium, first at 136.6 [[decibel]]s in 2013, followed by a measurement of 137.6 decibels in 2014. The noise has contributed to the team's [[Home advantage|home field advantage]] with an increase in [[false start]] (movement by an offensive player prior to the play) and [[delay of game]] (failure of the offense to snap the ball prior to the play clock expiring) penalties against visiting teams.<ref name=\"NY Times 2006-09-24\">{{cite news |first=John |last=Branch |title=For N.F.L., Crowd Noise Is a Headache |date=September 9, 2004 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/24/sports/football/24noise.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1 |work=The New York Times |page=1 |accessdate=November 14, 2009}}</ref> The stadium was the first in the NFL to implement a [[FieldTurf]] [[artificial turf|artificial field]]. Numerous college and high school [[American football]] games have also been played at the stadium.\n\nCenturyLink Field is also designed for soccer. The first sporting event held included a [[United Soccer Leagues|United Soccer Leagues (USL)]] [[Seattle Sounders (1994\u20132008)|Seattle Sounders]] match. The USL team began using the stadium regularly for home games in 2003. The [[Expansion of Major League Soccer|MLS expansion]] team Seattle Sounders FC, began its inaugural season in 2009 at the stadium. CenturyLink Field was the site of the [[MLS Cup]] in [[MLS Cup 2009|2009]] and [[MLS Cup 2019|2019]]. The venue also hosted the [[2010 U.S. Open Cup Final|2010]] and [[2011 U.S. Open Cup Final|2011]] tournament finals for the [[U.S. Open Cup]]. Sounders FC won both times and new attendance records were set each year it was hosted at CenturyLink Field. In August 2013, the Sounders broke a new home field attendance record when 67,385 fans turned out to watch them play the [[Portland Timbers]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Mayers |first=Joshua |title=Sounders deliver win in Clint Dempsey's home debut |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/sports/sounders/sounders-deliver-win-in-clint-dempseyrsquos-home-debut/ |work=The Seattle Times |date=August 25, 2013}}</ref> The stadium hosted several [[CONCACAF Gold Cup]] matches across multiple editions, and the [[Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario]] in 2016. It is part of Seattle's bid to host matches during the [[2026 FIFA World Cup]], which was awarded to the United States, Canada, and Mexico.\n\n== Funding ==\nThe Seahawks played their home games at the Kingdome from their [[1976 Seattle Seahawks season|1976 inaugural season]] until [[1999 Seattle Seahawks season|1999]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://o.seattlepi.com/kingdome/hawks.shtml |title=A month of Sundays with the Hawks |author=Clare Farnsworth |newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date=March 27, 2000 |accessdate=March 20, 2012}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> In 1995 a proposal was made to issue [[King County, Washington|county]] [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] to fund a remodeling project of the facility. The proposal failed, and as a result, Seahawks' owner [[Ken Behring]] threatened to sell or move the team. In 1997 local billionaire Paul Allen pledged to acquire the team if a new stadium could be built and said that the team could not be profitable until they left the Kingdome. He asked the [[Washington State Legislature|state legislature]] to hold a special statewide [[referendum]] on a proposal to finance a new stadium.

Originally called '''Seahawks Stadium''', it became '''Qwest Field''' in June 2004, when telecommunications carrier [[Qwest]] acquired the naming rights.

The complex also includes the Event Center with the Washington Music Theater (WaMu Theater), a parking garage, and a public plaza. The venue hosts concerts, trade shows, and consumer shows along with sporting events. Located within a mile&nbsp;(1.6&nbsp;km) of Downtown Seattle, the stadium is accessible by multiple freeways and forms of mass transit.\n\nThe stadium was built between 2000 and 2002 on the site of the [[Kingdome]] after voters approved funding for the construction in a statewide election held in June 1997. This vote created the [[Washington State Public Stadium Authority]] to oversee public ownership of the venue. The owner of the Seahawks, [[Paul Allen]], formed First & Goal Inc. to develop and operate the new facilities. Allen was closely involved in the design process and emphasized the importance of an open-air venue with an intimate atmosphere.\n\nThe crowd is notoriously loud during Seahawks games. It has twice held the [[Guinness World Record]] for loudest crowd roar at an outdoor stadium, first at 136.6 [[decibel]]s in 2013, followed by a measurement of 137.6 decibels in 2014. The noise has contributed to the team's [[Home advantage|home field advantage]] with an increase in [[false start]] (movement by an offensive player prior to the play) and [[delay of game]] (failure of the offense to snap the ball prior to the play clock expiring) penalties against visiting teams.<ref name=\"NY Times 2006-09-24\">{{cite news |first=John |last=Branch |title=For N.F.L., Crowd Noise Is a Headache |date=September 9, 2004 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/24/sports/football/24noise.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1 |work=The New York Times |page=1 |accessdate=November 14, 2009}}</ref> The stadium was the first in the NFL to implement a [[FieldTurf]] [[artificial turf|artificial field]].

The first sporting event held included a [[United Soccer Leagues|United Soccer Leagues (USL)]] [[Seattle Sounders (1994\u20132008)|Seattle Sounders]] match. The USL team began using the stadium regularly for home games in 2003. The [[Expansion of Major League Soccer|MLS expansion]] team Seattle Sounders FC, began its inaugural season in 2009 at the stadium. CenturyLink Field was the site of the [[MLS Cup]] in [[MLS Cup 2009|2009]] and [[MLS Cup 2019|2019]]. The venue also hosted the [[2010 U.S. Open Cup Final|2010]] and [[2011 U.S. Open Cup Final|2011]] tournament finals for the [[U.S. Open Cup]]. Sounders FC won both times and new attendance records were set each year it was hosted at CenturyLink Field. In August 2013, the Sounders broke a new home field attendance record when 67,385 fans turned out to watch them play the [[Portland Timbers]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Mayers |first=Joshua |title=Sounders deliver win in Clint Dempsey's home debut |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/sports/sounders/sounders-deliver-win-in-clint-dempseyrsquos-home-debut/ |work=The Seattle Times |date=August 25, 2013}}</ref> The stadium hosted several [[CONCACAF Gold Cup]] matches across multiple editions, and the [[Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario]] in 2016.

In 1997 local billionaire Paul Allen pledged to acquire the team if a new stadium could be built and said that the team could not be profitable until they left the Kingdome. He asked the [[Washington State Legislature|state legislature]] to hold a special statewide [[referendum]] on a proposal to finance a new stadium.

Later, he formed a [[Hip hop music|Hip hop]] group [[Bluntbylon]] with [[Smayla]] and several other members. Their career started mostly on [[YouTube]]. He also made a few solo-works at that period. In 2011, he released his first [[Extended play|EP]] ''Replay'', on which his first song with Buba Corelli appeared.\n\n=== 2012 works ===\nIn 2012 he released his first solo album ''Rije\u010d na rije\u010d''. He also released  EP ''Mahala'' with [[Shtela]]. He also started making album ''Lice Ulice'', but it is still unfinished yet. In 2012 two singles were released, (''Lice Ulice'' and ''Uze\u0107u vam sve).'' \n\nIn 2015, ''Dom,'' the third single from album was released, revealing that the project is not canceled but only paused. Also, in 2012 Jala, alongside Buba Corelli, started releasing singles from EP ''SA Sin City''. There were 5 singles released, and EP was fully completed in 2013.\n\n=== ''Pakt s \u0110avolom'' alongside Buba Corelli ===\nOn 16 November 2014, the first single from the album, \"Bez Tebe\", was released. Full album was released in 13 December 2014, following three singles (''22'', ''Trindidad & Tobago'' and ''Borba''). The album gained huge success and Jala and Corelli were the most listened rappers in Bosnia and Herzegovina at the time.\n\nFollowing the success of ''Pakt s \u0110avolom'', in 2015 both Jala and Buba Corelli started to make their music more commercial and less underground as they used to. In 6 September Jala released a single ''Casino''.Buba Corelli was jailed during that time, and Jala continued to make music without him until the end of Eurovision when Corelli was released. \n\nDuring Corelli's time in jail, Jala released a single ''Dom'' from album ''Lice Ulice'' that was dedicated to Corelli and 3 other rappers who were jailed alongside him. Although he wasn't singing [[turbo-folk]] himself, he made several works with turbo-folk artists [[Dado Polumenta]] (''Dominantna''), [[Maya Berovi\u0107]] (''To me radi'', with Buba Corelli as a co-star) and [[Mile Kiti\u0107]]'s daughter, [[Elena Kiti\u0107]]. In 28 July 2016, Elena released her first official song ''Folira'' where Jala was a co-star.\n\nIn October 2016, both Jala and Buba Corelli announced that they will publish new album \"Kruna\". Album contains 8 singles. It was more commercial than their last albums, and most of the songs don't include both Jala and Buba. Only two singles, ''Klinka'' and ''Ne Volim'' (featuring Elena) were made by both of them. 3 singles, ''Comfort'', ''Sporije'' and ''Dokaz'' were made by Buba Corelli only, and rest of them, ''Restart'', ''La Martina'' and ''Bak\u0161i\u0161'' were made by Jala. The album used advanced technology, with 6 out of 8 singles published with [[4K resolution|4K]] videos, and two lyrics videos.\n\n== Collaboration with other rappers ==\nSince 2011 Jala was mostly collaborating with Bosnian underground rappers that were mostly popular at that time. Besides Buba Corelli, he was known for his work with his colleagues from Bluntbylon, with Smayla as most popular one. He was also working with Buba Corelli's group [[G recordz]] and their members. \n\nHe also made several songs with rappers [[Klijent]] and [[An\u0107i]] and also members of the [[Sarajevo]] groups [[Tre\u0107a Smjena Crew]], [[Capital City Crew]] and [[Dlan Beats]]. In 2012 he was working with one of the biggest Bosnian rappers, [[Frenkie]], with whom he released music video ''Ne odustajem'' for the song of the same name from ''Rije\u010d na Rije\u010d''. He later made several works with [[Serbia]]n [[Juice (Serbian rapper)|Juice]] who was also his guest on ''Pakt s \u0110avolom''.
