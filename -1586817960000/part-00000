It was formed on the 4 April 1848 in New Brunswick where it has served continually ever since. Today it is a reserve armoured reconnaissance regiment with two squadrons. Its Regimental Headquarters (RHQ) and A Squadron are located in [[Moncton]] with B Squadron located in [[Sussex, New Brunswick]].\n\nIn 1957 its name was chosen for the formation of a new Regular Force regiment to serve in addition to the reserve regiment. The Regular regiment served in [[CFB Gagetown|Gagetown, New Brunswick]], [[CFB Petawawa|Petawawa, Ontario]], the Sinai, Cyprus, Iserlohn (Fort Beausejour), Soest, and Lahr, West Germany. The Regular Force regiment was disbanded in 1998.\n\n==History==\nThe earliest beginnings of the 8th Canadian Hussars (Princess Louise's) have traditionally been traced to the year 1775 in the Colony of Virginia where Captain John Saunders, of Princess Anne County, raised a troop of cavalry at his own expense to fight for the Crown against the Colonial rebels. This unusual Regiment included riflemen, grenadiers, artillery and cavalry, and it never knew defeat during the American conflict for independence. In September 1783, the Regiment as an entity sailed for Nova Scotia and reached Saint John on 27 September 1783. A large number of these Loyalists soldiers settled in the Saint John and Kennebecasis valleys by Loyalist soldiers, had a military tradition and indeed an effective militia. In 1839, the York County Troop, known for a time as the York Light Dragoons, was mobilized for service in the Aroostook War, a conflict with American lumbermen that never quite came to open fighting. For four months they patrolled the border and roads between Woodstock, Fredericton and Saint John. By 1848, eleven troops of cavalry were in existence. These troops included Hampton Troop of Cavalry, Assekeag Troop of Cavalry, Apohaqui Troop of Cavalry, Upham Troop of Cavalry, Johnston Troop of Cavalry, Shediac Troop of Cavalry, Springfield Troop of Cavalry, among others.\n\nBy authority of Militia General Order No 1 of 4 April 1848, these eleven independent troops were united to form a Regiment entitled the New Brunswick Yeomanry Cavalry. It is this date that is officially recognized as the formation date of the 8th Canadian Hussars.\n*Redesignated 31 May 1872 as the 8th Regiment of Cavalry\n*Redesignated 18 July 1884 as the 8th Princess Louise's New Brunswick Regiment of Cavalry\n*Redesignated 1 January 1893 8th \"Princess Louise's New Brunswick Hussars\"\n*Redesignated 11 February 1941 as the 2nd (Reserve) Regiment, 8th Princess Louise's (New Brunswick) Hussars\n*Redesignated 1 April 1941 as the 5th (Reserve) Armoured Regiment, 8th Princess Louise's (New Brunswick) Hussars\n*Redesignated 4 February 1949 as the 8th Princess Louise's (New Brunswick) Hussars (5th Armoured Regiment)\n*Redesignated 29 January 1957 as the 2/8th Canadian Hussars (Princess Louise's) upon the formation of the Canadian Army (Regular) 1/8th Canadian Hussars (Princess Louise's)\n*1 January 1960 the 2/8th Canadian Hussars (Princess Louise's) were redesignated as 8th Canadian Hussars (Princess Louise's) (Militia) and the 1/8th Canadian Hussars (Princess Louise's) were redesignated as the 8th Canadian Hussars (Princess Louise's)\n*15 April 1993 the 8th Canadian Hussars (Princess Louise's) (Militia) and the 8th Canadian Hussars (Princess Louise's) were amalgamated and redesignated as the 8th Canadian Hussars (Princess Louise's)<ref name=Vol3>Canadian Forces Publication A-DH-267-003 Insignia and Lineages of the Canadian Forces.

The regiment disbanded on 18 February 1918.<ref name=Vol3/>\n\n===The Second World War===\nThe Second World War provided the regiment's first opportunity for active service as a formed unit. The regiment mobilized as the 4th Canadian Motorcycle Regiment, CASF (8 NBH) on 24 May 1940. It was converted to armour and redesignated as the \"8th Princess Louise's (New Brunswick) Hussars) CAC, CASF\", on 9 February 1941; as the 5th Armoured Regiment (8th Princess Louise's (New Brunswick) Hussars, CASF, on 11 February 1941.\nThe regiment embarked for Britain on 9 October 1941\n\nThe regiment landed in Italy on 19 December 1943 as a unit of the 5th Armoured Brigade, [[5th Canadian Armoured Division]]. It was renamed as the \"5th Armoured Regiment (8th Princess Louise's (New Brunswick) Hussars, CAC, CASF\", on 15 October 1943.\nThe regiment [[Allied invasion of Italy|landed in Italy]] on 19 December 1943 at Naples and saw action soon and frequently thereafter. The regiment fought in the Liri Valley, the Melfa Crossing, Ceprano, The Gothic Line, Missano Ridge, Coriano, the [[Lamone (river)|Lamone River]] Crossing, and Coventello where it distinguished itself.\n\nIt moved to North-West Europe on 17 February 1945 as part of [[Operation Goldflake]]. The Hussars sailed from Italy to Southern France, and then moved by rail to Northwest Europe. After refitting the tanks, the regiment went into action in the Netherlands, breaking through to Putten in mid-April. The regiment then moved north for the final actions of the war at the Delfzijl Pocket where 3,000 German soldiers surrendered to the regiment. It was renamed as the \"5th Armoured Regiment (8th Princess Louise's (New Brunswick) Hussars, RCAC, CASF\", on 2 August 1945.\n\nOn 26 January 1946, the regiment arrived in Halifax and the next day reached Sussex, New Brunswick where it was demobilized. The overseas regiment disbanded on 15 February 1946.<ref name=Vol3/>\n\n===Post World War II===\nIn 1950, the regiment was called upon to provide men for service with the Special Force which was raised and deployed to Korea, and in 1951 \"Y\" Troop was organized for service with the 27th Canadian Infantry Brigade in Germany.\n\nOn 29 January 1957, it was decided that a third armoured regiment would be formed in the [[Land Force Command|Canadian Army]]. As a result, the regiment was honoured with the privilege of providing its name to the new regiment. This resulted in the change of the regiment's name to the 8th Canadian Hussars (Princess Louise's). The Regular Regiment served in [[CFB Gagetown|Gagetown]], New Brunswick, Petawawa, Ontario, the Sinai, Cyprus, Iserlohn (Fort Beausejour), Soest and Lahr, West Germany.\n\nCpl. Paul R. Wallace and Tpr. Adrian A. Bons died while deployed to the Sinai as part of the United Nations Emergency Force on 27 November 1964.\n\nIn the summer of 1965, the regiment was deployed from their base at [[Petawawa, Ontario]] on a peacekeeping mission for the United Nations to the island nation of Cyprus. Tpr. Lennard W. Nass died on 27 September 1966 while deployed to Cyprus as part of the United Nations Force in Cyprus.\n\nThe regiment has participated in several \"aid to the civil authority\" missions in recent history. In the summer of 1990 the regiment sent a troop sized force to the province of Quebec in Cougars to assist in Canadian Forces Operations in the [[Oka Crisis]]. In the [[1998 Ice Storm]], the regiment provided a platoon-sized force to assist in the maintenance of infrastructure in the community of [[St. George, New Brunswick]]. In the fall of 1998, the regiment provided soldiers to the recovery effort for Swiss Air Flight 111.\n\nIn 2004, 8CH became an armoured reconnaissance unit, in place of its previous designation as simply an armoured unit. Along with this trade change the unit was given the new [[Mercedes-Benz]] [[Mercedes-Benz G-Class|G-Wagon]], a Jeep-like vehicle more suited to their new role as reconnaissance. The unit is stationed at the Moncton and Sussex detachments of [[CFB Gagetown]], [[New Brunswick]]. Its [[Colonel-in-Chief]] is [[Anne, Princess Royal|The Princess Royal]].\n\n===War in Afghanistan===\nThe regiment contributed an aggregate of more than 20% of its authorized strength to the various Task Forces which served in Afghanistan between 2002 and 2014.<ref name=\"pm.gc.ca\">{{cite web|url=http://pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2014/05/09/south-west-asia-theatre-honours |title=South-West Asia Theatre Honours |accessdate=2014-05-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512231549/http://pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2014/05/09/south-west-asia-theatre-honours |archivedate=2014-05-12 }}</ref>\n\n===Lineage chart===\nLineage of the units of the 8th Canadian Hussars:<ref>{{cite web|title=8th Canadian Hussars (Princess Louise's)|url=http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/his/ol-lo/vol-tom-3/par1/arm-bli/8CH-eng.asp|website=Volume 3, Part 1: Armour, Artillery and Field Engineer Regiments \u2013 Armour Regiments|publisher=Directorate of History and Heritage|accessdate=13 February 2015}}</ref>\n{{chart top|width=100%|Lineage}}\n{{chart/start|align=center}}\n{{chart|aa812| | |12WCR| | | | |aa812=1812|12WCR=1st and 2nd Bn, Westmorland County Regt}}\n{{chart|aa815|F|~|Dbndd| | | | |Dbndd=''Disbanded''|aa815=1815}}\n{{chart|aa864|:| | | | | |Ippvy|Ippvy=Independent troops of cavy|aa864=1864}}\n{{chart|aa869|:| | | | | | NBYC|aa869=1869|NBYC=New Brunswick Regt of Yeomanry Cavy}}\n{{chart|aa872|:| | | | | |8Cavy|aa872=1872|8Cavy=8th Regt of Cavy}}\n{{chart|aa884|:| | | | | |8PLNB|8PLNB=8th Princess Louise's New Brunswick Regt of Cavy|aa884=1884}}\n{{chart|aa893|:| | | | | |8PLNB|8PLNB=8th <small>\"Princess Louise's New Brunswick Hussars\"</small>|aa893=1893}}\n{{chart|aa914|:| | 6CMR| | |!| |6CMR=6th Regt, Canadian Mounted Rifles, <small>CEF</small>|aa914=1914}}\n{{chart|aa916|:| |A45CM| | |!| |A45CM=''Absorbed by 4th and 5th Canadian Mounted Rifles Bn, <small>CEF</small>''|aa916=1916}}\n{{chart|aa918|:|F|Dbndd| | |!| |Dbndd=''Disbanded''|aa918=1918}}\n{{chart| nbsp|:|:| | | | | |!| |nbsp=&nbsp;}}\n{{chart|aa940|:|:| 4CMR| | |!| |aa940=1940|4CMR=4th Canadian Motorcycle Regt, <small>CASF (8 NBH)</small>}}\n{{chart|aa941|:|:| 8PLH| |28PLH|28PLH=2nd <small>(Reserve)</small> Regt, 8th Princess Louise's <small>(New Brunswick)</small> Hussars|8PLH=8th Princess Louise's <small>(New Brunswick)</small> Hussars, <small>CAC, CASF</small>|aa941=1941}}\n{{chart|aa941|:|:| 5AR | |5A8PL|5A8PL=5th <small>(Reserve)</small> Armd Regt, 8th Princess Louise's <small>(New Brunswick)</small> Hussars|5AR=5th Armd Regt <small>(8th Princess Louise's (New Brunswick) Hussars), CASF</small>|aa941=1941}}\n{{chart|aa943|:|:| 5AR | | |!| |5AR=5th Armd Regt <small>(8th Princess Louise's (New Brunswick) Hussars), CAC, CASF</small>|aa943=1943}}\n{{chart|aa945|:|:| 5AR | | |!| |5AR=5th Armd Regt <small>(8th Princess Louise's (New Brunswick) Hussars), RCAC, CASF</small>|aa945=1945}}\n{{chart|aa946|:|:|Dbndd| | |!| |Dbndd=''Disbanded''|aa946=1946}}\n{{chart|aa949|:|:| | | | | 8PLH|8PLH=8th Princess Louise's <small>(New Brunswick)</small> Hussars <small>(5th Armd Regt)</small>|aa949=1949}}\n{{chart|aa957|:|:| 18CH| | 28CH|28CH=2/8th Canadian Hussars <small>(Princess Louise's)</small>|18CH=1/8th Canadian Hussars <small>(Princess Louise's)</small>|aa957=1957}}\n{{chart|aa960|:|:|8CHPL| |CHPLM|aa960=1960|8CHPL=8th Canadian Hussars <small>(Princess Louise's)</small>|CHPLM=8th Canadian Hussars <small>(Princess Louise's) (Militia)</small>}}\n{{chart|aa960|:|L| P6R |~| P6R |aa960=1960|P6R=''Perpetuates 6th Regt''}}\n{{chart|aa993|:| | |`| 8CH |'| |aa993=1993|8CH=8th Canadian Hussars <small>(Princess Louise's)</small>}}\n{{chart|aa012|L|~|~|~|PW181| | |aa012=2012|PW181=''Perpetuates War of 1812 units''}}\n{{chart|CrntY| | | | | |!| | | |CrntY={{CURRENTYEAR}}}}\n{{chart/end}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|\n{{(!}}class=\"wikitable\"\n{{!}}+ Abbreviations used in the chart\n{{!}}-\n{{!}} '''Abbreviation''' {{!!}} '''Phrase'''\n{{!}}-\n{{!}} Armd {{!!}} Armoured\n{{!}}-\n{{!}} Bn {{!!}} Battalion\n{{!}}-\n{{!}} CAC {{!!}} [[Canadian Armoured Corps]]\n{{!}}-\n{{!}} CASF {{!!}} [[Canadian Active Service Force]]\n{{!}}-\n{{!}} Cavy {{!!}} Cavalry\n{{!}}-\n{{!}} CEF {{!!}} [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]]\n{{!}}-\n{{!}} RCAC {{!!}} [[Royal Canadian Armoured Corps]]\n{{!}}-\n{{!}} Regt {{!!}} Regiment\n{{!)}}\n{{chart bottom}}\n\n==Battle honours==\n[[Image:8CH guidon.jpg|thumb|The Guidon of the 8th Canadian Hussars (Princess Louise's).]]\n\nIn the list below, battle honours in capitals were awarded for participation in large operations and campaigns, while those in lowercase indicate honours granted for more specific battles.

It was renamed as the \"5th Armoured Regiment (8th Princess Louise's (New Brunswick) Hussars, CAC, CASF\", on 15 October 1943.\nThe regiment [[Allied invasion of Italy|landed in Italy]] on 19 December 1943 at Naples and saw action soon and frequently thereafter. The regiment fought in the Liri Valley, the Melfa Crossing, Ceprano, The Gothic Line, Missano Ridge, Coriano, the [[Lamone (river)|Lamone River]] Crossing, and Coventello where it distinguished itself.\n\nIt moved to North-West Europe on 17 February 1945 as part of [[Operation Goldflake]]. The Hussars sailed from Italy to Southern France, and then moved by rail to Northwest Europe. After refitting the tanks, the regiment went into action in the Netherlands, breaking through to Putten in mid-April. The regiment then moved north for the final actions of the war at the Delfzijl Pocket where 3,000 German soldiers surrendered to the regiment. It was renamed as the \"5th Armoured Regiment (8th Princess Louise's (New Brunswick) Hussars, RCAC, CASF\", on 2 August 1945.\n\nOn 26 January 1946, the regiment arrived in Halifax and the next day reached Sussex, New Brunswick where it was demobilized. The overseas regiment disbanded on 15 February 1946.<ref name=Vol3/>\n\n===Post World War II===\nIn 1950, the regiment was called upon to provide men for service with the Special Force which was raised and deployed to Korea, and in 1951 \"Y\" Troop was organized for service with the 27th Canadian Infantry Brigade in Germany.\n\nOn 29 January 1957, it was decided that a third armoured regiment would be formed in the [[Land Force Command|Canadian Army]]. As a result, the regiment was honoured with the privilege of providing its name to the new regiment. This resulted in the change of the regiment's name to the 8th Canadian Hussars (Princess Louise's). The Regular Regiment served in [[CFB Gagetown|Gagetown]], New Brunswick, Petawawa, Ontario, the Sinai, Cyprus, Iserlohn (Fort Beausejour), Soest and Lahr, West Germany.\n\nCpl. Paul R. Wallace and Tpr. Adrian A. Bons died while deployed to the Sinai as part of the United Nations Emergency Force on 27 November 1964.\n\nIn the summer of 1965, the regiment was deployed from their base at [[Petawawa, Ontario]] on a peacekeeping mission for the United Nations to the island nation of Cyprus. Tpr. Lennard W. Nass died on 27 September 1966 while deployed to Cyprus as part of the United Nations Force in Cyprus.\n\nThe regiment has participated in several \"aid to the civil authority\" missions in recent history. In the summer of 1990 the regiment sent a troop sized force to the province of Quebec in Cougars to assist in Canadian Forces Operations in the [[Oka Crisis]]. In the [[1998 Ice Storm]], the regiment provided a platoon-sized force to assist in the maintenance of infrastructure in the community of [[St. George, New Brunswick]]. In the fall of 1998, the regiment provided soldiers to the recovery effort for Swiss Air Flight 111.\n\nIn 2004, 8CH became an armoured reconnaissance unit, in place of its previous designation as simply an armoured unit. Along with this trade change the unit was given the new [[Mercedes-Benz]] [[Mercedes-Benz G-Class|G-Wagon]], a Jeep-like vehicle more suited to their new role as reconnaissance. The unit is stationed at the Moncton and Sussex detachments of [[CFB Gagetown]], [[New Brunswick]]. Its [[Colonel-in-Chief]] is [[Anne, Princess Royal|The Princess Royal]].\n\n===War in Afghanistan===\nThe regiment contributed an aggregate of more than 20% of its authorized strength to the various Task Forces which served in Afghanistan between 2002 and 2014.<ref name=\"pm.gc.ca\">{{cite web|url=http://pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2014/05/09/south-west-asia-theatre-honours |title=South-West Asia Theatre Honours |accessdate=2014-05-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512231549/http://pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2014/05/09/south-west-asia-theatre-honours |archivedate=2014-05-12 }}</ref>\n\n===Lineage chart===\nLineage of the units of the 8th Canadian Hussars:<ref>{{cite web|title=8th Canadian Hussars (Princess Louise's)|url=http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/his/ol-lo/vol-tom-3/par1/arm-bli/8CH-eng.asp|website=Volume 3, Part 1: Armour, Artillery and Field Engineer Regiments \u2013 Armour Regiments|publisher=Directorate of History and Heritage|accessdate=13 February 2015}}</ref>\n{{chart top|width=100%|Lineage}}\n{{chart/start|align=center}}\n{{chart|aa812| | |12WCR| | | | |aa812=1812|12WCR=1st and 2nd Bn, Westmorland County Regt}}\n{{chart|aa815|F|~|Dbndd| | | | |Dbndd=''Disbanded''|aa815=1815}}\n{{chart|aa864|:| | | | | |Ippvy|Ippvy=Independent troops of cavy|aa864=1864}}\n{{chart|aa869|:| | | | | | NBYC|aa869=1869|NBYC=New Brunswick Regt of Yeomanry Cavy}}\n{{chart|aa872|:| | | | | |8Cavy|aa872=1872|8Cavy=8th Regt of Cavy}}\n{{chart|aa884|:| | | | | |8PLNB|8PLNB=8th Princess Louise's New Brunswick Regt of Cavy|aa884=1884}}\n{{chart|aa893|:| | | | | |8PLNB|8PLNB=8th <small>\"Princess Louise's New Brunswick Hussars\"</small>|aa893=1893}}\n{{chart|aa914|:| | 6CMR| | |!| |6CMR=6th Regt, Canadian Mounted Rifles, <small>CEF</small>|aa914=1914}}\n{{chart|aa916|:| |A45CM| | |!| |A45CM=''Absorbed by 4th and 5th Canadian Mounted Rifles Bn, <small>CEF</small>''|aa916=1916}}\n{{chart|aa918|:|F|Dbndd| | |!| |Dbndd=''Disbanded''|aa918=1918}}\n{{chart| nbsp|:|:| | | | | |!| |nbsp=&nbsp;}}\n{{chart|aa940|:|:| 4CMR| | |!| |aa940=1940|4CMR=4th Canadian Motorcycle Regt, <small>CASF (8 NBH)</small>}}\n{{chart|aa941|:|:| 8PLH| |28PLH|28PLH=2nd <small>(Reserve)</small> Regt, 8th Princess Louise's <small>(New Brunswick)</small> Hussars|8PLH=8th Princess Louise's <small>(New Brunswick)</small> Hussars, <small>CAC, CASF</small>|aa941=1941}}\n{{chart|aa941|:|:| 5AR | |5A8PL|5A8PL=5th <small>(Reserve)</small> Armd Regt, 8th Princess Louise's <small>(New Brunswick)</small> Hussars|5AR=5th Armd Regt <small>(8th Princess Louise's (New Brunswick) Hussars), CASF</small>|aa941=1941}}\n{{chart|aa943|:|:| 5AR | | |!| |5AR=5th Armd Regt <small>(8th Princess Louise's (New Brunswick) Hussars), CAC, CASF</small>|aa943=1943}}\n{{chart|aa945|:|:| 5AR | | |!| |5AR=5th Armd Regt <small>(8th Princess Louise's (New Brunswick) Hussars), RCAC, CASF</small>|aa945=1945}}\n{{chart|aa946|:|:|Dbndd| | |!| |Dbndd=''Disbanded''|aa946=1946}}\n{{chart|aa949|:|:| | | | | 8PLH|8PLH=8th Princess Louise's <small>(New Brunswick)</small> Hussars <small>(5th Armd Regt)</small>|aa949=1949}}\n{{chart|aa957|:|:| 18CH| | 28CH|28CH=2/8th Canadian Hussars <small>(Princess Louise's)</small>|18CH=1/8th Canadian Hussars <small>(Princess Louise's)</small>|aa957=1957}}\n{{chart|aa960|:|:|8CHPL| |CHPLM|aa960=1960|8CHPL=8th Canadian Hussars <small>(Princess Louise's)</small>|CHPLM=8th Canadian Hussars <small>(Princess Louise's) (Militia)</small>}}\n{{chart|aa960|:|L| P6R |~| P6R |aa960=1960|P6R=''Perpetuates 6th Regt''}}\n{{chart|aa993|:| | |`| 8CH |'| |aa993=1993|8CH=8th Canadian Hussars <small>(Princess Louise's)</small>}}\n{{chart|aa012|L|~|~|~|PW181| | |aa012=2012|PW181=''Perpetuates War of 1812 units''}}\n{{chart|CrntY| | | | | |!| | | |CrntY={{CURRENTYEAR}}}}\n{{chart/end}}\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|\n{{(!}}class=\"wikitable\"\n{{!}}+ Abbreviations used in the chart\n{{!}}-\n{{!}} '''Abbreviation''' {{!!}} '''Phrase'''\n{{!}}-\n{{!}} Armd {{!!}} Armoured\n{{!}}-\n{{!}} Bn {{!!}} Battalion\n{{!}}-\n{{!}} CAC {{!!}} [[Canadian Armoured Corps]]\n{{!}}-\n{{!}} CASF {{!!}} [[Canadian Active Service Force]]\n{{!}}-\n{{!}} Cavy {{!!}} Cavalry\n{{!}}-\n{{!}} CEF {{!!}} [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]]\n{{!}}-\n{{!}} RCAC {{!!}} [[Royal Canadian Armoured Corps]]\n{{!}}-\n{{!}} Regt {{!!}} Regiment\n{{!)}}\n{{chart bottom}}\n\n==Battle honours==\n[[Image:8CH guidon.jpg|thumb|The Guidon of the 8th Canadian Hussars (Princess Louise's).]]\n\nIn the list below, battle honours in capitals were awarded for participation in large operations and campaigns, while those in lowercase indicate honours granted for more specific battles.

It is named after [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] coach and commentator [[John Madden]], and has sold more than 130 million copies. It also currently is the only officially licensed [[National Football League]] (NFL) video game, and has influenced many players and coaches of the physical sport. Among the game's features are detailed playbooks and player statistics, and voice commentary in the style of a real [[National Football League on television|NFL television broadcast]]. {{asof|2013}} the franchise has generated over $4 billion in sales.\n\n[[Electronic Arts]] (EA) founder [[Trip Hawkins]] conceived the series and approached Madden in 1984 for his endorsement and expertise. Because of Madden's insistence that the game be as realistic as possible, the first version of ''John Madden Football'' did not appear until 1988. EA has released annual versions since 1990, and the series' name changed to ''Madden NFL'' in 1993 after EA acquired the rights to use NFL teams and players.

Early versions of ''Madden'' were created by external development studios such as Bethesda, [[Visual Concepts]], and [[Stormfront Studios]]. ''John Madden Football '92'' also featured the ambulance which would run over any players in its path.\n\nAfter Visual Concepts failed to deliver ''Madden NFL '96'' for the new [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in 1995, EA hired Tiburon Entertainment for ''Madden NFL '97''<ref name=\"IGN_History\"/> and later acquired the company, centralizing development in-house.<ref name=\"thefranchise\"/> It planned to release ''John Madden Football'' as its first sports-based [[arcade game]], but the game was cancelled due to unenthusiastic reactions from [[Game testing|play testers]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Off the Wall at AMOA|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=76 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=January 1995|page=34}}</ref> EA's refusal to release ''Madden'' and other sports titles for the [[Dreamcast]] in 1999 contributed to the console's lack of success and Sega's exit from the hardware market.<ref name=\"IGN_History\"/>\n\n====Franchise Mode====\n{{expand section|date=September 2012}}\nIn 1998 Electronic Arts added \"Franchise Mode\" to ''Madden'', giving players the ability to play multiple seasons, make off-season draft picks, and trade players.<ref>{{cite news |author= |url=http://articles.cnn.com/1998-09-04/tech/9809_04_madden99.idg_1_madden-nfl-big-year-playstation?_s=PM:TECH |title=Madden NFL 99 the best PC football game bar none - CNN |publisher=Articles.cnn.com |date=1998-09-04 |accessdate=2012-09-24 }}{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\nWithin Franchise Mode, players take on the role of General Manager and manage all personnel matters, including contracts, free agency, draft picks, and hiring and firing coaches. The player also acts as a head coach-like character (although there is a head coach figure in-game), choosing which players to play, making substitutions, running practices, practicing gameplans, etc.\n\nPlayers may play with any of the NFL's 32 franchises, and can choose whether or not to have trade deadlines, salary caps, and if they want to start their Franchise with a 49-round fantasy draft of all active NFL players. Players can also upload created teams for use in the game.\n\nOnce in game, players run training camp (individual drills for improving players' attributes), play in preseason games and compete in a regular 16-game NFL season, including playoffs and the Super Bowl. The player has the option to play any game in the simulation, including those involving other teams if they so desire, or may simulate through the games as they choose. Most versions of ''Madden'' give a player 30 years with their franchise, sometimes with an opportunity to apply for the Hall of Fame at the end of the simulation.\n\n===2000s===\n====''Madden NFL 2000''====\n====''Madden NFL 2001''====\n''[[Madden NFL 2001]]'' featured a segment called \"Great Games\" where one would be put in a situation where they control one team and would have to win the game with a set amount of time. If the player wins, they unlock either a new team or a stadium. Overall, there were more than 60 teams and over 80 stadiums in ''Madden NFL 2001''. [[Tennessee Titans]] running back [[Eddie George]] is the cover athlete.\n\n====''Madden NFL 2002''====\n''[[Madden NFL 2002]]'' featured for the first time Create-A-Team where one would make a team and play with that team in either Play Now or Franchise mode. It also featured Create-A-League mode but it never caught on. Create-A-Team was not featured in ''Madden NFL 13'' and moving teams was first featured in ''Madden NFL 2004'' called \"Stadium\" in the Franchise mode of the game. ''Madden NFL 2002'' was the 2nd highest selling game in 2002. [[Minnesota Vikings]] quarterback [[Daunte Culpepper]] is the cover athlete.\n\n====''Madden NFL 2003''====\nThere are multiple modes of game play, from a quick head-to-head game to running a team for a whole season or even multiple seasons. Online play, which was a new feature for ''[[Madden NFL 2003]]'' (in this version there are also mini-camp challenges) was only available for users of the [[PlayStation 2]] console, [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] console, or a [[Microsoft Windows]] PC until early [[2004 in video gaming|2004]]. [[St. Louis Rams]] running back [[Marshall Faulk]] is the cover athlete.<!-- At [[E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo)|E3 2004]], Microsoft and EA Sports -->\n\n====''Madden NFL 2004''====\nAlso, starting with ''[[Madden NFL 2004]]'', EA Sports created the new ''Playmaker'' tool, using the right analog joystick found on each of the adjustments previously unavailable in prior installments of the franchise.<ref>{{cite web | last = Navarro | first = Alex | title = Madden NFL 2004 Impressions | website = [[GameSpot]] | date = 2003-07-09 | url = http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/sports/madden2004/news.html?sid=6071304 | accessdate = 2009-04-01 }}</ref> One such adjustment includes the ability to switch which direction a running play was going without changing the formation. Prior to the Playmaker tool, the Player could only call one of four available \"hot routes.\" With Playmaker and the use of the right thumb stick, the player is given 4 additional Hot Route options. When the quarterback has the ball the Playmaker Tool can be used to make receivers alter their routes mid-play. When running the ball on offense, the runner can control the direction in which the blocker is going. Defensive alignment adjustments, however, were not available leading to obvious imbalance in favor of the Offensive player. [[Atlanta Falcons]] quarterback [[Michael Vick]] is the cover athlete.\n\n====''Madden NFL 2005''====\nIn ''[[Madden NFL 2005]]'', EA Sports ran a campaign with the Theme \"Fear the D\" emphasising their improvements on the \"other side of the ball.\" In an attempt to re-balance the players experience, EA gave a Playmaker Tool to the defense. Similar to the offensive Playmaker Tool, the defensive Playmaker allows the player to make pre-snap defensive adjustments. EA Sports further utilized the right analog joystick on defense by creating the \"Hit Stick\", an option on defense that allows the controlled player to make big hits, with a simple flick, that increases the chances the ball carrier will fumble. Also introduced for the first time is the \"Formation Shift.\" This new feature allowed players to shift their formation in the pre-snap audible menu without actually changing the play. For example, if you call a run play up the middle out of a goal line formation, you could then call a formation shift and make your players spread out into a four wide receiver formation while still in the same running play. The problem with this new function was that EA also added a fatigue penalty for the defense causing defensive players to get more tired each time there was a formation shift. This led to players on offense calling multiple formation shifts each play making the defensive players too exhausted to keep up and force them to substitute out of the game until they are fully rested. This led to more imbalance that could only be fixed by turning off fatigue. [[Baltimore Ravens]] linebacker [[Ray Lewis]] is the cover athlete.\n\n''2005'' also added \"EA Sports Radio\", a fictional show that plays during the menu screen of Franchise mode to provide a greater sense of a storyline during gameplay. It features [[Tony Bruno]] as the host, who often interviews players and coaches about how the season is going and also has quiz questions in which fake listeners call in to make attempts at answering football-related questions. It included mock interviews of famous NFL players and coaches throughout the in-game season. Some fans have criticized [[EA Sports]] for not including new features to the 'programming' as the radio became stale after only two seasons in franchise mode, but the feature drew acclaim for adding content to the Franchise menu. Also added was the Newspaper where the player could look at National News from licensed USA Today and Licensed Local papers for almost each of the 32 NFL teams. Lastly, 2005 also saw the introduction of multiple progressions during franchise mode. Previously NFL players in Madden would only progress or regress at the end of each season. Now at the end of Week 5, 11, and 17 the game would use a program to \"progress\" players based on their performance in addition to end of season progression.\n\n====''Madden NFL 06''====\nIn ''[[Madden NFL 06]]'', the \"Truck Stick\" was introduced. This feature allows the offensive player to lower his shoulder and break a tackle, or back juke to avoid one. Another new feature is the ''[[Be-a-pro mode|Superstar Mode]]'', which allows the player to take control of a rookie, and progress through his career.<ref>{{cite web | last = Ekberg | first = Brian | title = Madden NFL 06 Superstar Mode Preview | website = GameSpot | date = 2005-07-01 | url = http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/sports/maddennfl2006/news.html?sid=6128568 | accessdate = 2009-04-01 }}</ref> This includes an IQ test, interviews, workouts, the NFL Draft, hiring an agent, and other aspects of a superstar's life. [[Philadelphia Eagles]] quarterback [[Donovan McNabb]] is the cover athlete.\n\nEA also introduced the ''QB Vision'' feature in the 2006 installment. With this feature, a cone of spotlight emits from the quarterback during passing plays, simulating his field of vision. To make an accurate pass, the quarterback must have his intended receiver in his field of vision. Passing to a receiver not in the cone reduces pass accuracy significantly. The size of the quarterback's vision cone is directly correlated to his Awareness and Passer Accuracy rating; [[Brett Favre]] and [[Peyton Manning]] see nearly the entire field at once, whereas an inexperienced quarterback such as [[J. P. Losman]] or [[Kyle Boller]] sees only a sliver of the field.<ref name=\"thefranchise\"/> This feature also allows for bigger plays and more interceptions.\n\nAlso, EA sports added the ''Smart Route''. This means that when pressing a hot route to the corresponding receiver, you put the analog stick down and the receiver will run to the first down, and you can throw him the ball.\n\nWhile current gen Madden remained the same with the exception of a \"Smart Route\" and \"QB Vision\", this was also the first year Madden was released on the next-gen Xbox 360. It was completely stripped down, almost every change made in the previous gen was wiped away.\n\n====''EA Sports Madden NFL Football''====\nThis is an arcade game developed by [[Global VR]], and released in 2005. The game comes in standard and deluxe cabinets. It can be played with up to four players, and includes five game modes: Exhibition, Training, Tournament, Competition, and Career. It features rosters from the 2004-2005 season.<ref>{{cite web | title = EA Sports Madden NFL Football flyer | url = https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/flyers_video/globalvr/332000302.jpg | accessdate = 2019-09-01 }}</ref>\n\n====''Madden NFL 07''====\nIn ''[[Madden NFL 07]]'', EA introduced ''Lead Blocker Controls'' which allow users to control blockers during running plays. In addition, EA redefined the Truck Stick into the ''Highlight Stick''. With the Highlight Stick, users can have their running backs perform different running moves and combos, instead of just bowling over defenders. Truck Stick features still exist for bigger backs, but not for smaller backs who would never realistically use them anyway. Instead, more agile backs perform acrobatic ducks and dodges to avoid tackles.<ref>{{cite web | last = Navarro | first = Alex | title = Madden NFL 07 Review | website = GameSpot | date = 2006-08-22 | url = http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/sports/madden07/review.html | accessdate = 2009-04-01 }}</ref> [[Seattle Seahawks]] running back [[Shaun Alexander]] is the cover athlete.\n\n====''EA Sports Madden NFL Football: Season 2''====\nThis game is the sequel to EA Sports Madden NFL Football. Like the original, it was also developed by [[Global VR]]. It was released in 2006 only in arcades. This version adds QB Vision, the Hit Stick, and the Truck Stick. The rosters are also updated for the 2006-2007 season.<ref>{{cite web | title = EA Sports Madden NFL Football: Season 2 flyer | url = https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/flyers_video/globalvr/332002801.jpg | accessdate = 2019-09-01 }}</ref>\n\n====''Madden NFL 08''====\nIn ''[[Madden NFL 08]]'', the ''Weapons'' feature was added, allowing superstar players to be noticed. [[Randy Moss]], for example, is a Go-To-Guy, allowing him to make amazing one-handed grabs. [[Peyton Manning]] is a Franchise QB. It also includes new skill drills, Hit Stick 2.0, and Ring of a Champion features. [[Tennessee Titans]] quarterback [[Vince Young]] is on the cover.\nMadden NFL 08 was also the last [[GameCube]] game ever released. The 2008 edition would be the last to appear on PC until Madden 19 in 2018.\n\n====''Madden NFL 09''====\n''[[Madden NFL 09]]'' was released on August 12, 2008.

EA Sports Senior Producer Phil Frazier, up to 32 players were able to participate in competitive games, the NFL Draft and conduct trades between their teams. The game was also the first of the series to incorporate a Madden IQ. The Madden IQ is used to automatically gauge your skills through a series of mini-games consisting of run offense, pass offense, run defense, and pass defense. At the end of each of the drills, the player receives a score ranging from rookie to all-Madden. The final Madden IQ is a mixture of those scores which is used to control the game's difficulty.<ref name=\"thefranchise\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/sports/maddennfl09/news.html?sid=6189938&om_act=convert&om_clk=newsfeatures&tag=newsfeatures;title;1:|title=Madden NFL 09|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/sports/maddennfl09/news.html?sid=6191473&mode=previews:|title=Madden NFL 09|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n====''Madden NFL 10''====\n''[[Madden NFL 10]]'' was released on August 14, 2009.

It has been held since [[Super Bowl XXIX|1995]] during Super Bowl weekend in the host city and, in the past, participation included NFL players and celebrities. The Madden Bowl's participation has changed over the years from being an event held with athletes, musicians, and celebrities, to become an event where only NFL players who are invited to participate get a chance to play. Participants in the Madden Bowl are free to choose whichever team they like. Winners receive a Madden Bowl trophy and recognition in the upcoming ''Madden'' video game.\n\nThe 2006 Madden Bowl, held during the weekend of [[Super Bowl XL]] in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], was televised on [[ESPN]] and premiered in April 2006. Concurrently, ESPN also hosted a separate series of competitions called ''[[Madden Nation]]'', which was a [[reality television]] show that chronicled a cross-country trip to crown the best Madden player in the United States and aired from 2005 to 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.operationsports.com/news/269002/espn2s-madden-nation-to-begin-fourth-season/ |title=ESPN2's Madden Nation to Begin Fourth Season |publisher=Operation Sports |author=Steve_OS |date=15 September 2008 |accessdate=16 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nFrom 2011 to 2012, the Madden Bowl competition utilizes the new Online Team Play feature included in ''[[Madden NFL 11]]''. Rather than competing as individuals, players form groups of three to square-off for the trophy.

It is named after [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] coach and commentator [[John Madden]], and has sold more than 130 million copies. It also currently is the only officially licensed [[National Football League]] (NFL) video game, and has influenced many players and coaches of the physical sport. Among the game's features are detailed playbooks and player statistics, and voice commentary in the style of a real [[National Football League on television|NFL television broadcast]]. {{asof|2013}} the franchise has generated over $4 billion in sales.\n\n[[Electronic Arts]] (EA) founder [[Trip Hawkins]] conceived the series and approached Madden in 1984 for his endorsement and expertise. Because of Madden's insistence that the game be as realistic as possible, the first version of ''John Madden Football'' did not appear until 1988. EA has released annual versions since 1990, and the series' name changed to ''Madden NFL'' in 1993 after EA acquired the rights to use NFL teams and players. Madden retired as a broadcaster in 2009, but continues to lend his name and to provide expertise for the game franchise.\n\n==Overview==\n{{rquote|right|A computer is a helluva lot smarter than me.|John Madden, 2014{{r|helfand20150202}}}}\n\n{{as of|2013}} Electronic Arts has sold more than 100 million copies of ''Madden NFL'', and more than five million in one year, for more than $4 billion in total sales.<ref name=\"gaudiosi20130905\">{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/2013/09/05/technology/innovation/madden-25/ | title=Madden: The $4 billion video game franchise | work=CNN | date=2013-09-05 | accessdate=25 January 2015 | author=Gaudiosi, John}}</ref> At [[EA Tiburon]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] a team of 30 developers and more than 100 [[game testers]] works on each new game in the series,<ref name=\"thefranchise\"/> which {{asof|2012|alt=as of 2012}} contains more than 10 million lines of [[source code]].<ref name=\"bissell20120117\">{{cite news | url=http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7473139/tom-bissell-making-madden-nfl | title=Kickoff: ''Madden NFL'' and the Future of Video Game Sports | work=Grantland | date=2012-01-17 | accessdate=January 21, 2012 | author=Bissell, Tom}}</ref>\n\nMadden, once better known for [[Ace Hardware]] commercials than football despite winning [[Super Bowl XI]] as the head coach for the [[History of the Oakland Raiders|Oakland Raiders]], is now better known for ''Madden NFL'' than as coach or broadcaster.<ref name=\"horowitz20071123\">{{cite web | url=http://www.sega-16.com/2007/11/interview-michael-knox/ | title=Interview: Michael Knox | publisher=Sega-16 | date=2007-11-23 | accessdate=25 January 2015 | author=Horowitz, Ken}}</ref>{{r|thefranchise}} He receives an estimated $2 to 3 million each year for his endorsement<ref name=\"snider20080806\">{{cite news | url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/2008-08-05-madden-game-main_N.htm | title=As John Madden would say, 'Boom!'

Hawkins]] created a clone of the [[Strat-o-Matic]] paper and dice-based football simulation game as a teenager. The game was unsuccessful due to its complexity, and he hoped to one day delegate its rules to a computer. At [[Harvard College]], where Hawkins played football for the [[Harvard Crimson football|Crimson]], he wrote a football simulation for the [[PDP-11]] minicomputer which, he later said, predicted that the [[Miami Dolphins]] would defeat the [[Minnesota Vikings]] 23\u20136 (actually 24\u20137) in the [[1974 Super Bowl]].{{r|thefranchise}}<ref name=\"ferrell198805\">{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/1988-05-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_096_1988_May#page/n15/mode/2up |title=These Are a Few of Their Favorite Games |work=Compute! |date=May 1988 |accessdate=10 November 2013 |author=Ferrell, Keith |pages=14}}</ref> After founding Electronic Arts in 1982{{r|thefranchise}}\u2014\"The real reason that I founded [it] was because I wanted to make computerized versions of games like Strat-O-Matic\", Hawkins later said<ref name=\"lemire20110210\">{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/joe_lemire/02/10/strat.o.matic/index.html |title=Strat-O-Matic more than a game for its founder and devotees |work=Sports Illustrated |date=2011-02-10 |accessdate=December 10, 2012 |author=Lemire, Joe}}</ref>{{r|suellentrop20100125}}\u2014the company began designing a microcomputer football game.

Early plans envisioned six or seven players per team because of technical limitations but Madden insisted on having 11 players,<ref name=\"thefranchise\" />{{r|bissell20120117}} stating \"I'm not putting my name on it if it's not real.\"<ref name=\"IGN_History\" /> Ybarra, who had played [[chess]], not football, in high school, became an expert on the subject through his work, but found that 11 players overwhelmed contemporary home computers. Most projects that are as delayed as ''Madden'' are canceled; Ybarra and developer Robin Antonick needed three years, more than twice the length of the average development process. The project became known within the company as \"Trip's Folly\", and Madden believed at times that EA had given up.<ref name=\"thefranchise\" />\n\nThe company hired [[Bethesda Softworks]] to finish the game, but this only got them partway to their goal.

This added to the delay.<ref name=\"IGN_History\" /> After a final development push, ''[[John Madden Football (1988)|John Madden Football]]'' debuted in 1988 for the [[Apple II series]] of computers.

The console maker agreed, afraid that EA would sell its reverse-engineered knowledge to other companies; the agreement saved EA $35 million over the next three years. As its own Joe Montana-endorsed football game would miss the 1990 [[Christmas shopping season]], Sega asked EA to let it sell ''Madden'' with the Montana name. EA refused, but offered an inferior alternative that lacked ''Madden'''s 3D graphics and most of its 113 plays.<ref name=\"thefranchise\"/>{{r|horowitz20071123}} ''[[Joe Montana Football]]'' sold well despite shipping after Christmas 1990, and remained popular after [[BlueSky Software]] took over development.<ref name=\"IGN_History\"/> ''[[John Madden Football (1990 video game)|John Madden Football]]'' for the Genesis, however, became both the first hugely successful ''Madden'' game\u2014selling 400,000 copies when the company expected 75,000{{r|harris201503}}\u2014and the first [[killer app]] for EA and Sega, helping the console gain market share against the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]].<ref name=\"thefranchise\"/><ref name=\"IGN_History\"/> From 1992 to 1994, ''[[Mega (magazine)|Mega]]'' placed the game at #1 in their monthly Top 100 Mega Drive Games of All Time.\n\nIn 1990, EA producer [[Richard Hilleman]] brought in veteran sports game designer [[Scott Orr]], who had founded the mid-1980s [[Commodore 64]] game publisher GameStar, and had led the design of their best-selling sports games. The team of Orr and Hilleman designed and led the development of what is today still recognizable as the modern ''Madden''. Early versions of ''Madden'' were created by external development studios such as Bethesda, [[Visual Concepts]], and [[Stormfront Studios]]. ''John Madden Football '92'' also featured the ambulance which would run over any players in its path.\n\nAfter Visual Concepts failed to deliver ''Madden NFL '96'' for the new [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in 1995, EA hired Tiburon Entertainment for ''Madden NFL '97''<ref name=\"IGN_History\"/> and later acquired the company, centralizing development in-house.<ref name=\"thefranchise\"/> It planned to release ''John Madden Football'' as its first sports-based [[arcade game]], but the game was cancelled due to unenthusiastic reactions from [[Game testing|play testers]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Off the Wall at AMOA|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=76 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=January 1995|page=34}}</ref> EA's refusal to release ''Madden'' and other sports titles for the [[Dreamcast]] in 1999 contributed to the console's lack of success and Sega's exit from the hardware market.<ref name=\"IGN_History\"/>\n\n====Franchise Mode====\n{{expand section|date=September 2012}}\nIn 1998 Electronic Arts added \"Franchise Mode\" to ''Madden'', giving players the ability to play multiple seasons, make off-season draft picks, and trade players.<ref>{{cite news |author= |url=http://articles.cnn.com/1998-09-04/tech/9809_04_madden99.idg_1_madden-nfl-big-year-playstation?_s=PM:TECH |title=Madden NFL 99 the best PC football game bar none - CNN |publisher=Articles.cnn.com |date=1998-09-04 |accessdate=2012-09-24 }}{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\nWithin Franchise Mode, players take on the role of General Manager and manage all personnel matters, including contracts, free agency, draft picks, and hiring and firing coaches. The player also acts as a head coach-like character (although there is a head coach figure in-game), choosing which players to play, making substitutions, running practices, practicing gameplans, etc.\n\nPlayers may play with any of the NFL's 32 franchises, and can choose whether or not to have trade deadlines, salary caps, and if they want to start their Franchise with a 49-round fantasy draft of all active NFL players. Players can also upload created teams for use in the game.\n\nOnce in game, players run training camp (individual drills for improving players' attributes), play in preseason games and compete in a regular 16-game NFL season, including playoffs and the Super Bowl. The player has the option to play any game in the simulation, including those involving other teams if they so desire, or may simulate through the games as they choose. Most versions of ''Madden'' give a player 30 years with their franchise, sometimes with an opportunity to apply for the Hall of Fame at the end of the simulation.\n\n===2000s===\n====''Madden NFL 2000''====\n====''Madden NFL 2001''====\n''[[Madden NFL 2001]]'' featured a segment called \"Great Games\" where one would be put in a situation where they control one team and would have to win the game with a set amount of time. If the player wins, they unlock either a new team or a stadium. Overall, there were more than 60 teams and over 80 stadiums in ''Madden NFL 2001''. [[Tennessee Titans]] running back [[Eddie George]] is the cover athlete.\n\n====''Madden NFL 2002''====\n''[[Madden NFL 2002]]'' featured for the first time Create-A-Team where one would make a team and play with that team in either Play Now or Franchise mode. It also featured Create-A-League mode but it never caught on. Create-A-Team was not featured in ''Madden NFL 13'' and moving teams was first featured in ''Madden NFL 2004'' called \"Stadium\" in the Franchise mode of the game. ''Madden NFL 2002'' was the 2nd highest selling game in 2002. [[Minnesota Vikings]] quarterback [[Daunte Culpepper]] is the cover athlete.\n\n====''Madden NFL 2003''====\nThere are multiple modes of game play, from a quick head-to-head game to running a team for a whole season or even multiple seasons. Online play, which was a new feature for ''[[Madden NFL 2003]]'' (in this version there are also mini-camp challenges) was only available for users of the [[PlayStation 2]] console, [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] console, or a [[Microsoft Windows]] PC until early [[2004 in video gaming|2004]]. [[St. Louis Rams]] running back [[Marshall Faulk]] is the cover athlete.<!-- At [[E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo)|E3 2004]], Microsoft and EA Sports -->\n\n====''Madden NFL 2004''====\nAlso, starting with ''[[Madden NFL 2004]]'', EA Sports created the new ''Playmaker'' tool, using the right analog joystick found on each of the adjustments previously unavailable in prior installments of the franchise.<ref>{{cite web | last = Navarro | first = Alex | title = Madden NFL 2004 Impressions | website = [[GameSpot]] | date = 2003-07-09 | url = http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/sports/madden2004/news.html?sid=6071304 | accessdate = 2009-04-01 }}</ref> One such adjustment includes the ability to switch which direction a running play was going without changing the formation. Prior to the Playmaker tool, the Player could only call one of four available \"hot routes.\" With Playmaker and the use of the right thumb stick, the player is given 4 additional Hot Route options. When the quarterback has the ball the Playmaker Tool can be used to make receivers alter their routes mid-play. When running the ball on offense, the runner can control the direction in which the blocker is going. Defensive alignment adjustments, however, were not available leading to obvious imbalance in favor of the Offensive player. [[Atlanta Falcons]] quarterback [[Michael Vick]] is the cover athlete.\n\n====''Madden NFL 2005''====\nIn ''[[Madden NFL 2005]]'', EA Sports ran a campaign with the Theme \"Fear the D\" emphasising their improvements on the \"other side of the ball.\" In an attempt to re-balance the players experience, EA gave a Playmaker Tool to the defense. Similar to the offensive Playmaker Tool, the defensive Playmaker allows the player to make pre-snap defensive adjustments. EA Sports further utilized the right analog joystick on defense by creating the \"Hit Stick\", an option on defense that allows the controlled player to make big hits, with a simple flick, that increases the chances the ball carrier will fumble. Also introduced for the first time is the \"Formation Shift.\" This new feature allowed players to shift their formation in the pre-snap audible menu without actually changing the play. For example, if you call a run play up the middle out of a goal line formation, you could then call a formation shift and make your players spread out into a four wide receiver formation while still in the same running play. The problem with this new function was that EA also added a fatigue penalty for the defense causing defensive players to get more tired each time there was a formation shift. This led to players on offense calling multiple formation shifts each play making the defensive players too exhausted to keep up and force them to substitute out of the game until they are fully rested. This led to more imbalance that could only be fixed by turning off fatigue. [[Baltimore Ravens]] linebacker [[Ray Lewis]] is the cover athlete.\n\n''2005'' also added \"EA Sports Radio\", a fictional show that plays during the menu screen of Franchise mode to provide a greater sense of a storyline during gameplay. It features [[Tony Bruno]] as the host, who often interviews players and coaches about how the season is going and also has quiz questions in which fake listeners call in to make attempts at answering football-related questions. It included mock interviews of famous NFL players and coaches throughout the in-game season. Some fans have criticized [[EA Sports]] for not including new features to the 'programming' as the radio became stale after only two seasons in franchise mode, but the feature drew acclaim for adding content to the Franchise menu. Also added was the Newspaper where the player could look at National News from licensed USA Today and Licensed Local papers for almost each of the 32 NFL teams. Lastly, 2005 also saw the introduction of multiple progressions during franchise mode. Previously NFL players in Madden would only progress or regress at the end of each season. Now at the end of Week 5, 11, and 17 the game would use a program to \"progress\" players based on their performance in addition to end of season progression.\n\n====''Madden NFL 06''====\nIn ''[[Madden NFL 06]]'', the \"Truck Stick\" was introduced. This feature allows the offensive player to lower his shoulder and break a tackle, or back juke to avoid one. Another new feature is the ''[[Be-a-pro mode|Superstar Mode]]'', which allows the player to take control of a rookie, and progress through his career.<ref>{{cite web | last = Ekberg | first = Brian | title = Madden NFL 06 Superstar Mode Preview | website = GameSpot | date = 2005-07-01 | url = http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/sports/maddennfl2006/news.html?sid=6128568 | accessdate = 2009-04-01 }}</ref> This includes an IQ test, interviews, workouts, the NFL Draft, hiring an agent, and other aspects of a superstar's life. [[Philadelphia Eagles]] quarterback [[Donovan McNabb]] is the cover athlete.\n\nEA also introduced the ''QB Vision'' feature in the 2006 installment. With this feature, a cone of spotlight emits from the quarterback during passing plays, simulating his field of vision. To make an accurate pass, the quarterback must have his intended receiver in his field of vision. Passing to a receiver not in the cone reduces pass accuracy significantly. The size of the quarterback's vision cone is directly correlated to his Awareness and Passer Accuracy rating; [[Brett Favre]] and [[Peyton Manning]] see nearly the entire field at once, whereas an inexperienced quarterback such as [[J. P. Losman]] or [[Kyle Boller]] sees only a sliver of the field.<ref name=\"thefranchise\"/> This feature also allows for bigger plays and more interceptions.\n\nAlso, EA sports added the ''Smart Route''. This means that when pressing a hot route to the corresponding receiver, you put the analog stick down and the receiver will run to the first down, and you can throw him the ball.\n\nWhile current gen Madden remained the same with the exception of a \"Smart Route\" and \"QB Vision\", this was also the first year Madden was released on the next-gen Xbox 360. It was completely stripped down, almost every change made in the previous gen was wiped away.\n\n====''EA Sports Madden NFL Football''====\nThis is an arcade game developed by [[Global VR]], and released in 2005. The game comes in standard and deluxe cabinets. It can be played with up to four players, and includes five game modes: Exhibition, Training, Tournament, Competition, and Career. It features rosters from the 2004-2005 season.<ref>{{cite web | title = EA Sports Madden NFL Football flyer | url = https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/flyers_video/globalvr/332000302.jpg | accessdate = 2019-09-01 }}</ref>\n\n====''Madden NFL 07''====\nIn ''[[Madden NFL 07]]'', EA introduced ''Lead Blocker Controls'' which allow users to control blockers during running plays. In addition, EA redefined the Truck Stick into the ''Highlight Stick''. With the Highlight Stick, users can have their running backs perform different running moves and combos, instead of just bowling over defenders. Truck Stick features still exist for bigger backs, but not for smaller backs who would never realistically use them anyway. Instead, more agile backs perform acrobatic ducks and dodges to avoid tackles.<ref>{{cite web | last = Navarro | first = Alex | title = Madden NFL 07 Review | website = GameSpot | date = 2006-08-22 | url = http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/sports/madden07/review.html | accessdate = 2009-04-01 }}</ref> [[Seattle Seahawks]] running back [[Shaun Alexander]] is the cover athlete.\n\n====''EA Sports Madden NFL Football: Season 2''====\nThis game is the sequel to EA Sports Madden NFL Football. Like the original, it was also developed by [[Global VR]]. It was released in 2006 only in arcades. This version adds QB Vision, the Hit Stick, and the Truck Stick.

[[Randy Moss]], for example, is a Go-To-Guy, allowing him to make amazing one-handed grabs. [[Peyton Manning]] is a Franchise QB. It also includes new skill drills, Hit Stick 2.0, and Ring of a Champion features. [[Tennessee Titans]] quarterback [[Vince Young]] is on the cover.\nMadden NFL 08 was also the last [[GameCube]] game ever released. The 2008 edition would be the last to appear on PC until Madden 19 in 2018.\n\n====''Madden NFL 09''====\n''[[Madden NFL 09]]'' was released on August 12, 2008.

EA Sports Senior Producer Phil Frazier, up to 32 players were able to participate in competitive games, the NFL Draft and conduct trades between their teams. The game was also the first of the series to incorporate a Madden IQ. The Madden IQ is used to automatically gauge your skills through a series of mini-games consisting of run offense, pass offense, run defense, and pass defense. At the end of each of the drills, the player receives a score ranging from rookie to all-Madden. The final Madden IQ is a mixture of those scores which is used to control the game's difficulty.<ref name=\"thefranchise\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/sports/maddennfl09/news.html?sid=6189938&om_act=convert&om_clk=newsfeatures&tag=newsfeatures;title;1:|title=Madden NFL 09|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/sports/maddennfl09/news.html?sid=6191473&mode=previews:|title=Madden NFL 09|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n====''Madden NFL 10''====\n''[[Madden NFL 10]]'' was released on August 14, 2009.

Madden 10 has several new features including the PRO-TAK animation technology, which allows up to nine man gang tackles and fumble pile-ups to help players 'fight for every yard', in this year's tagline.

It has been held since [[Super Bowl XXIX|1995]] during Super Bowl weekend in the host city and, in the past, participation included NFL players and celebrities. The Madden Bowl's participation has changed over the years from being an event held with athletes, musicians, and celebrities, to become an event where only NFL players who are invited to participate get a chance to play. Participants in the Madden Bowl are free to choose whichever team they like. Winners receive a Madden Bowl trophy and recognition in the upcoming ''Madden'' video game.\n\nThe 2006 Madden Bowl, held during the weekend of [[Super Bowl XL]] in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], was televised on [[ESPN]] and premiered in April 2006. Concurrently, ESPN also hosted a separate series of competitions called ''[[Madden Nation]]'', which was a [[reality television]] show that chronicled a cross-country trip to crown the best Madden player in the United States and aired from 2005 to 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.operationsports.com/news/269002/espn2s-madden-nation-to-begin-fourth-season/ |title=ESPN2's Madden Nation to Begin Fourth Season |publisher=Operation Sports |author=Steve_OS |date=15 September 2008 |accessdate=16 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nFrom 2011 to 2012, the Madden Bowl competition utilizes the new Online Team Play feature included in ''[[Madden NFL 11]]''. Rather than competing as individuals, players form groups of three to square-off for the trophy. After this feature was discontinued, the Madden Bowl competition continued in a Head-to-Head format.\n\n===Madden Bowl winners===\n* 1995: [[Reggie Brooks]]\n* 1996: [[Reggie Brooks]]\n* 1997: [[Jimmy Spencer (football)|Jimmy Spencer]]\n* 1998: [[Morris Chestnut]]\n* 1999: [[Ray Mickens]]\n* 2000: [[Terry Jackson (running back)|Terry Jackson]]\n* 2001: [[Jacquez Green]]\n* 2002: [[Jacquez Green]]\n* 2003: [[Dwight Freeney]]\n* 2004: [[Dwight Freeney]]\n* 2005: [[Michael Lewis (safety)|Michael Lewis]]\n* 2006: [[Alex Smith (tight end)|Alex Smith]]\n* 2007: [[Alex Smith (tight end)|Alex Smith]]\n* 2008: [[Willis McGahee]]\n* 2009: [[Antonio Bryant]]\n* 2010: [[Maurice Jones-Drew]]\n* 2011: [[Patrick Willis]], [[Chad Ochocinco]], and [[Maria Menounos]]\n* 2012: [[Drew Brees]], [[Jimmy Graham]], and [[Tim Tebow]]\n* 2013: [[LeSean McCoy]]\n* 2014: [[Richard Sherman (American football)|Richard Sherman]]\n* 2015: [[Patrick Peterson]]\n* 2016: [[Eric Berry]]\n\n===Rookie Madden Bowl winners===\n* 2006: [[Alex Smith (tight end)|Alex Smith]]\n* 2007: [[Vince Young]]\n* 2008: [[Devin Thomas]]\n* 2009: [[Vernon Gholston]]\n\nFrom 2016-2017 the NFL Network aired Madden America which was hosted by Dave Grunfeld.

The game simulations conducted by EA have correctly predicted 11 of the last 17 Super Bowl winners. The company accurately predicted the final score for the 2015 game and other details, including a score of 24\u201314 in favor of Seattle in the third quarter, despite skepticism within EA that Seattle would lose after a double-digit lead.<ref name=\"exact-score\">{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/madden-15-predicted-the-exact-score-of-the-super-bowl-1683159462|title=''Madden 15'' Predicted the Exact Score of the Super Bowl|website=Kotaku|first=Jason|last=Schreier|date=February 1, 2015|accessdate=February 1, 2015}}</ref>{{r|helfand20150202}} The predictions were incorrect in 2008, 2011, 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2019.

It stars [[Michael J. Fox]] as teenager [[Marty McFly]], who accidentally [[Time travel|travels back in time]] from 1985 to 1955, where he meets his future parents and becomes his mother's romantic interest. [[Christopher Lloyd]] portrays the eccentric scientist [[Emmett Brown|Dr. Emmett \"Doc\" Brown]], his friend and the inventor of the [[DeLorean time machine|time-traveling DeLorean automobile]], who helps Marty repair history and return to 1985. The cast also includes [[Lea Thompson]] as Marty's mother [[Lorraine Baines-McFly |Lorraine]], [[Crispin Glover]] as his father [[George McFly |George]], and [[Thomas F. Wilson]] as [[Biff Tannen]], Marty and George's arch-nemesis.\n\nZemeckis and Gale wrote the script after Gale wondered whether he would have befriended his father if they had attended school together. Film studios rejected it until the financial success of Zemeckis' ''[[Romancing the Stone]]''. Zemeckis approached [[Steven Spielberg]], who agreed to produce the project at [[Amblin Entertainment]], with [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] as distributor. Fox was the first choice to play Marty, but he was busy filming his television series ''[[Family Ties]]'', and [[Eric Stoltz]] was cast; after the filmmakers decided he was wrong for the role, a deal was struck to allow Fox to film ''Back to the Future'' without interrupting his television schedule.\n\n''Back to the Future'' was released on July 3, 1985. It grossed over $381 million worldwide, becoming the [[1985 in film|highest-grossing film of 1985]]. It won the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]], the [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film]], and the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing |Best Sound Effects Editing]]. It received three Academy Award nominations, five [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]] nominations, and four [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] nominations, including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture&nbsp;\u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture (Musical or Comedy)]]. In 2007, the [[Library of Congress]] selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]], and in June 2008 the [[American Film Institute]]'s special [[AFI's 10 Top 10]] designated it the 10th-best science fiction film. The film began a [[Back to the Future (franchise)|franchise]] including two sequels, ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' (1989) and ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'' (1990), an [[Back to the Future (TV series)|animated series]], a [[Back to the Future: The Ride|theme park ride]], several [[List of Back to the Future video games|video games]], a series of [[Back to the Future (franchise)#Comic books|comic books]], and a [[Back to the Future (musical)|stage musical]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1985, [[Hill Valley (Back to the Future)|Hill Valley, California]], [[Marty McFly]] visits the home and lab of his friend, [[Emmett Brown|Emmett \"Doc\" Brown]], an eccentric scientist. Though missing for several days, Doc calls the lab and asks Marty to pick up some equipment for a special experiment later that night.\n\nAt school, Marty meets his girlfriend, [[Jennifer Parker]], and after being berated by the principal and failing his audition for the [[Battle of the Bands]], he confides in Jennifer that he fears that he will become like his parents despite his ambitions. At home, Marty's cowardly father [[George McFly|George]] is bullied by his supervisor, [[Biff Tannen]], while his mother [[Lorraine Baines McFly|Lorraine]] is an overweight, depressed alcoholic. Lorraine recalls how she met George when her father hit him with his car and [[Florence Nightingale effect|she subsequently nursed him back to health.]]\n\nMarty meets Doc at a parking lot by a shopping mall at 1:16 A.M. on October 26. Doc unveils a time machine [[DeLorean time machine|built from a modified DeLorean]] and powered by [[plutonium]] obtained from [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libyan]] terrorists with the promise of building a nuclear bomb. While showing Marty the controls, Doc sets the date to November 5, 1955, the day he conceived a time travel device. The terrorists arrive unexpectedly and open fire on them, finally shooting Doc when he surrenders. Marty escapes in the DeLorean and inadvertently activates the time machine in the process.\n\nMarty finds himself transported to November 5, 1955, without any plutonium to return. He encounters the teenage George and discovers that Biff has been bullying him since high school. After Marty saves George from an oncoming car, he is knocked unconscious and awakens to find himself tended to by Lorraine, who becomes infatuated with him.\n\nMarty tracks down Doc's younger self for help. Doc is unimpressed with Marty's knowledge of the future but finally believes him when he accurately recounts how Doc invented time travel. With no plutonium, Doc explains that the only power source capable of generating the necessary 1.21\u00a0GW of electricity for the time machine is a bolt of lightning. Marty shows Doc a flyer from the future that recounts a lightning strike at the town's courthouse due the coming Saturday night, November 12. When Doc instructs Marty to not leave his house or interact with anyone, as he could inadvertently [[Temporal paradox|alter the future]], they realize that he has prevented his parents from meeting by saving George from the car. Doc warns Marty that he must find a way for Lorraine to fall in love with George or he will be erased from existence. Marty attempts to correct his parents' history and warn Doc of the future dangers, but both strategies fail: his attempts to introduce his parents backfire during a confrontation with Biff and Doc refuses to listen to any information about the future, saying no one should know too much about their own destiny.\n\nAfter Lorraine asks Marty to the school dance, Marty devises a plan with George: he will feign inappropriate advances on Lorraine, allowing George to \"rescue\" her. The plan goes awry when a drunken Biff gets rid of Marty, making his gang lock him in the trunk of the performing band's car and attempts to force himself on Lorraine. Marty is then rescued by the band who unlock the trunk and drive away Biff's gang and rushes to stop him. Meanwhile, George, enraged, knocks out Biff, and Lorraine accompanies him to the dance floor, where they kiss while Marty performs with the band, securing his existence in the future.\n\nAs the storm arrives, Marty returns to the clock tower and the lightning strikes, sending Marty back to 1985 a few minutes before his original departure. After watching Doc get shot again, he grieves until Doc gets up and reveals that he had listened to Marty's warnings and worn a [[bulletproof vest]]. Doc takes Marty home and departs to the future. Marty awakens the next morning to find that his father is now a self-confident and successful author, his mother is fit and happy, and Biff is now an obsequious [[Auto detailing|auto valet]]. As Marty reunites with Jennifer, Doc reappears with the DeLorean and insists that they return with him to aid their future children. The trio boards the DeLorean which now flies and travels into the future.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael J.

Searching their basement, Gale found his father's high school yearbook and discovered he was president of his graduating class.

The era also marked the rise of teenagers as an important cultural element, the birth of rock 'n' roll, and suburban expansion, which flavored the story.<ref>Klastornin, Hibbin (1990), pp. 61\u201370</ref> In an early script, the time machine was a refrigerator, and Marty would need the power of an atomic explosion at the [[Nevada National Security Site|Nevada Test Site]] to return home. Zemeckis was concerned that children would accidentally lock themselves in refrigerators and felt it was more useful if the time machine were mobile. The [[DMC DeLorean|DeLorean]] was chosen because its design made the gag about the family of farmers mistaking it for a [[flying saucer]] believable.<ref>{{cite web|title=Back To The Future: Ten Things To Know About The Movie |url=http://www.moviefanfare.com/back-to-the-future/ |website=Movie Fanfare |accessdate=December 21, 2014 |url-status = dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222005631/http://www.moviefanfare.com/back-to-the-future/ |archivedate= December 22, 2014 }}</ref> Zemeckis and Gale found it difficult to create a believable friendship between Marty and Brown before they created the giant guitar amplifier, and only resolved Marty's [[Oedipus complex |Oedipal]] relationship with his mother when they wrote the line \"It's like I'm kissing my brother.\" Biff Tannen was named after studio executive [[Ned Tanen]], who behaved aggressively toward Zemeckis and Gale during a script meeting for ''[[I Wanna Hold Your Hand (film)|I Wanna Hold Your Hand]]''.<ref name=freer /> Gale also later revealed that Biff's character was based on [[Donald Trump]].<ref name=NME>{{cite news|last1=Skinner|first1=Tom |title=\u2018Back To The Future\u2019 writer reveals Biff Tannen was inspired by Donald Trump |url= https://www.nme.com/news/back-to-the-future-writer-reveals-biff-tannen-was-inspired-by-donald-trump-2560286| accessdate= February 7, 2020| work= [[NME]] |date=October 23, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe first draft of ''Back to the Future'' was finished in February 1981 and presented to Columbia, who put the film in [[turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]]. \"They thought it was a really nice, cute, warm film, but not sexual enough,\" Gale said. \"They suggested that we take it to [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]], but we decided to see if any other of the major studios wanted a piece of us.\"<ref name=first /> Every [[major film studio]] rejected the script for the next four years, while it went through two more drafts.

The studio was set to begin shooting a comedic send-up of ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' entitled ''[[Big Trouble (1986 film)|Big Trouble]]''. Columbia's legal department determined that the film's plot was too similar to ''Double Indemnity'' and they needed the permission of [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], owners of the earlier film, if the film was ever to begin shooting. With ''Big Trouble'' set to go, desperate Columbia executives phoned Universal's [[Frank Price]] to get the necessary paperwork. Price was a former Columbia executive who had been fond of the script for ''Back to the Future'' during his tenure there. As a result, Universal agreed to trade the ''Double Indemnity'' license in exchange for the rights to ''Back to the Future''.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Fleming |first1=Mike |title=Blast From The Past On ''Back To The Future'': How Frank Price Rescued Robert Zemeckis' Classic From Obscurity |url= https://deadline.com/2015/10/back-to-the-future-frank-price-rescued-robert-zemeckis-classic-1201590119/ | accessdate=October 22, 2015 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]}}</ref>\n\nExecutive [[Sidney Sheinberg]] suggested changes to the script, such as changing Marty's mother's name from Meg to Lorraine (the name of his wife, actress [[Lorraine Gary]]), changing Brown's name from Professor Brown to Doc Brown, and replacing Doc's pet chimpanzee with a dog.<ref name=freer /> Sheinberg also wanted the title changed to ''Space Man from Pluto'',<ref name=\"Radio Times 30 August 2016\">{{cite magazine |last= Harrison  |first= Ellie |title= Back to the Future almost had a really bad title: Here's a memo to prove it...| url= http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-08-30/back-to-the-future-almost-had-a-really-bad-title| date= 30 August 2016 |magazine=[[Radio Times]] |location=London| accessdate=1 September 2016 }}</ref> convinced no successful film ever had \"future\" in the title.

With co-star [[Meredith Baxter]] on [[Parental leave|maternity leave]], he refused to allow Fox time off to work on a film. ''Back to the Future'' was originally scheduled for a May 1985 release, and it was late 1984 when it was learned that Fox would be unable to star in the film.<ref name=freer /> Zemeckis' next two choices were [[C. Thomas Howell]] and [[Eric Stoltz]]. Stoltz impressed the producers enough with his earlier portrayal of Roy L. Dennis in ''[[Mask (1985 film)|Mask]]'' (which had yet to be released) that they selected him to play Marty McFly.<ref name=\"making of\" /> Because of the difficult casting process, the start date was pushed back twice.<ref name=start>Kagan (2003), pp. 63\u201392</ref> [[John Cusack]] was also considered for the role.<ref>https://www.vulture.com/amp/2012/09/the-lost-roles-of-back-to-the-future.html</ref> [[Johnny Depp]] also auditioned for the role of Marty McFly.<ref>https://www.vulture.com/amp/2012/09/the-lost-roles-of-back-to-the-future.html</ref>\n\nPrincipal photography began in November 1984, but a few weeks into filming, Zemeckis determined Stoltz had been miscast. Although he and Spielberg realized that re-shooting the film would add $3 million to the $14 million budget, they decided to recast. Zemeckis believed Stoltz was not comedic enough and that he gave a \"terrifically ''dramatic'' performance\". Gale further explained they felt Stoltz was simply acting out the role, whereas Fox himself had a personality like Marty McFly. He felt Stoltz was uncomfortable riding a skateboard, whereas Fox was not. Stoltz confessed to director [[Peter Bogdanovich]] during a phone call, two weeks into the shoot, that he was unsure of Zemeckis and Gale's direction, and concurred that he was wrong for the role.<ref name=freer />\n\nFox's schedule was opened up in January 1985 when Baxter returned to ''Family Ties'' following her pregnancy. The ''Back to the Future'' crew met with Goldberg again, who made a deal that Fox's main priority would be ''Family Ties'', and if a scheduling conflict arose, \"we win\". Fox loved the script and was impressed by Zemeckis and Gale's sensitivity in releasing Stoltz because they nevertheless \"spoke very highly of him\".<ref name=freer /> [[Per Welinder]] and Bob Schmelzer assisted on the skateboarding scenes.<ref name=commentary>Robert Zemeckis, Bob Gale.

To make sure the film met this new date, two editors, Arthur Schmidt and Harry Keramidas, were assigned to the picture, while many sound editors worked 24-hour shifts. Eight minutes were cut, including Marty watching his mom cheat during an exam, George getting stuck in a telephone booth before rescuing Lorraine, as well as much of Marty pretending to be [[Darth Vader]]. Zemeckis almost cut out the \"[[Johnny B. Goode]]\" sequence as he felt it did not advance the story, but the preview audience loved it, so it was kept.

Zemeckis advised Silvestri to make his compositions grand and epic, despite the film's small scale, to impress Spielberg. Silvestri began recording the score two weeks before the first preview. He also suggested that [[Huey Lewis and the News]] create the theme song. Their first attempt was rejected by Universal, before they recorded \"[[The Power of Love (Huey Lewis and the News song)|The Power of Love]]\".<ref name=NBC /> The studio loved the final song but were disappointed it did not feature the film's title, so they had to send memos to radio stations to always mention its association with ''Back to the Future''.<ref name=freer /> In the end, the track \"[[Back in Time (Huey Lewis and the News song)|Back in Time]]\" was featured in the film, playing during the scene when Marty wakes up after his return to 1985 and also during the end credits.<ref name=NBC />\n\nAlthough it appears that Fox is actually playing a guitar, music supervisor [[Bones Howe]] hired Hollywood guitar coach and musician [[Paul Hanson (guitarist) |Paul Hanson]] to teach Fox to simulate playing all the parts so it would look realistic, including playing behind his head.

It stars [[Michael J. Fox]] as teenager [[Marty McFly]], who accidentally [[Time travel|travels back in time]] from 1985 to 1955, where he meets his future parents and becomes his mother's romantic interest. [[Christopher Lloyd]] portrays the eccentric scientist [[Emmett Brown|Dr. Emmett \"Doc\" Brown]], his friend and the inventor of the [[DeLorean time machine|time-traveling DeLorean automobile]], who helps Marty repair history and return to 1985. The cast also includes [[Lea Thompson]] as Marty's mother [[Lorraine Baines-McFly |Lorraine]], [[Crispin Glover]] as his father [[George McFly |George]], and [[Thomas F. Wilson]] as [[Biff Tannen]], Marty and George's arch-nemesis.\n\nZemeckis and Gale wrote the script after Gale wondered whether he would have befriended his father if they had attended school together. Film studios rejected it until the financial success of Zemeckis' ''[[Romancing the Stone]]''. Zemeckis approached [[Steven Spielberg]], who agreed to produce the project at [[Amblin Entertainment]], with [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] as distributor. Fox was the first choice to play Marty, but he was busy filming his television series ''[[Family Ties]]'', and [[Eric Stoltz]] was cast; after the filmmakers decided he was wrong for the role, a deal was struck to allow Fox to film ''Back to the Future'' without interrupting his television schedule.\n\n''Back to the Future'' was released on July 3, 1985. It grossed over $381 million worldwide, becoming the [[1985 in film|highest-grossing film of 1985]]. It won the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]], the [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film]], and the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing |Best Sound Effects Editing]]. It received three Academy Award nominations, five [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]] nominations, and four [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] nominations, including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture&nbsp;\u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture (Musical or Comedy)]]. In 2007, the [[Library of Congress]] selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]], and in June 2008 the [[American Film Institute]]'s special [[AFI's 10 Top 10]] designated it the 10th-best science fiction film. The film began a [[Back to the Future (franchise)|franchise]] including two sequels, ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' (1989) and ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'' (1990), an [[Back to the Future (TV series)|animated series]], a [[Back to the Future: The Ride|theme park ride]], several [[List of Back to the Future video games|video games]], a series of [[Back to the Future (franchise)#Comic books|comic books]], and a [[Back to the Future (musical)|stage musical]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1985, [[Hill Valley (Back to the Future)|Hill Valley, California]], [[Marty McFly]] visits the home and lab of his friend, [[Emmett Brown|Emmett \"Doc\" Brown]], an eccentric scientist. Though missing for several days, Doc calls the lab and asks Marty to pick up some equipment for a special experiment later that night.\n\nAt school, Marty meets his girlfriend, [[Jennifer Parker]], and after being berated by the principal and failing his audition for the [[Battle of the Bands]], he confides in Jennifer that he fears that he will become like his parents despite his ambitions. At home, Marty's cowardly father [[George McFly|George]] is bullied by his supervisor, [[Biff Tannen]], while his mother [[Lorraine Baines McFly|Lorraine]] is an overweight, depressed alcoholic. Lorraine recalls how she met George when her father hit him with his car and [[Florence Nightingale effect|she subsequently nursed him back to health.]]\n\nMarty meets Doc at a parking lot by a shopping mall at 1:16 A.M. on October 26. Doc unveils a time machine [[DeLorean time machine|built from a modified DeLorean]] and powered by [[plutonium]] obtained from [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libyan]] terrorists with the promise of building a nuclear bomb. While showing Marty the controls, Doc sets the date to November 5, 1955, the day he conceived a time travel device. The terrorists arrive unexpectedly and open fire on them, finally shooting Doc when he surrenders. Marty escapes in the DeLorean and inadvertently activates the time machine in the process.\n\nMarty finds himself transported to November 5, 1955, without any plutonium to return. He encounters the teenage George and discovers that Biff has been bullying him since high school. After Marty saves George from an oncoming car, he is knocked unconscious and awakens to find himself tended to by Lorraine, who becomes infatuated with him.\n\nMarty tracks down Doc's younger self for help. Doc is unimpressed with Marty's knowledge of the future but finally believes him when he accurately recounts how Doc invented time travel. With no plutonium, Doc explains that the only power source capable of generating the necessary {{convert|1.21|GW}} of electricity for the time machine is a bolt of lightning. Marty shows Doc a flyer from the future that recounts a lightning strike at the town's courthouse due the coming Saturday night, November 12. When Doc instructs Marty to not leave his house or interact with anyone, as he could inadvertently [[Temporal paradox|alter the future]], they realize that he has prevented his parents from meeting by saving George from the car. Doc warns Marty that he must find a way for Lorraine to fall in love with George or he will be erased from existence. Marty attempts to correct his parents' history and warn Doc of the future dangers, but both strategies fail: his attempts to introduce his parents backfire during a confrontation with Biff and Doc refuses to listen to any information about the future, saying no one should know too much about their own destiny.\n\nAfter Lorraine asks Marty to the school dance, Marty devises a plan with George: he will feign inappropriate advances on Lorraine, allowing George to \"rescue\" her. The plan goes awry when a drunken Biff gets rid of Marty, making his gang lock him in the trunk of the performing band's car and attempts to force himself on Lorraine. Marty is then rescued by the band who unlock the trunk and drive away Biff's gang and rushes to stop him. Meanwhile, George, enraged, knocks out Biff, and Lorraine accompanies him to the dance floor, where they kiss while Marty performs with the band, securing his existence in the future.\n\nAs the storm arrives, Marty returns to the clock tower and the lightning strikes, sending Marty back to 1985 a few minutes before his original departure. After watching Doc get shot again, he grieves until Doc gets up and reveals that he had listened to Marty's warnings and worn a [[bulletproof vest]]. Doc takes Marty home and departs to the future. Marty awakens the next morning to find that his father is now a self-confident and successful author, his mother is fit and happy, and Biff is now an obsequious [[Auto detailing|auto valet]]. As Marty reunites with Jennifer, Doc reappears with the DeLorean and insists that they return with him to aid their future children. The trio boards the DeLorean which now flies and travels into the future.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael J.

The studio was set to begin shooting a comedic send-up of ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' entitled ''[[Big Trouble (1986 film)|Big Trouble]]''. Columbia's legal department determined that the film's plot was too similar to ''Double Indemnity'' and they needed the permission of [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], owners of the earlier film, if the film was ever to begin shooting. With ''Big Trouble'' set to go, desperate Columbia executives phoned Universal's [[Frank Price]] to get the necessary paperwork. Price was a former Columbia executive who had been fond of the script for ''Back to the Future'' during his tenure there.

Although he and Spielberg realized that re-shooting the film would add $3 million to the $14 million budget, they decided to recast. Zemeckis believed Stoltz was not comedic enough and that he gave a \"terrifically ''dramatic'' performance\".

He felt Stoltz was uncomfortable riding a skateboard, whereas Fox was not.

He also suggested that [[Huey Lewis and the News]] create the theme song. Their first attempt was rejected by Universal, before they recorded \"[[The Power of Love (Huey Lewis and the News song)|The Power of Love]]\".<ref name=NBC /> The studio loved the final song but were disappointed it did not feature the film's title, so they had to send memos to radio stations to always mention its association with ''Back to the Future''.<ref name=freer /> In the end, the track \"[[Back in Time (Huey Lewis and the News song)|Back in Time]]\" was featured in the film, playing during the scene when Marty wakes up after his return to 1985 and also during the end credits.<ref name=NBC />\n\nAlthough it appears that Fox is actually playing a guitar, music supervisor [[Bones Howe]] hired Hollywood guitar coach and musician [[Paul Hanson (guitarist) |Paul Hanson]] to teach Fox to simulate playing all the parts so it would look realistic, including playing behind his head.

Distillation may result in essentially complete separation (nearly pure components), or it may be a partial separation that increases the concentration of selected components in the mixture. In either case, the process exploits differences in the [[Volatility (physics)|relative volatility]] of the mixture's components. In [[Chemical industry|industrial chemistry]], distillation is a [[unit operation]] of practically universal importance, but it is a physical separation process, not a [[chemical reaction]]. Distillation can also be used to separate a solution made of two or more liquids or fractions, they are called miscible liquids and they must have different boiling points, for example, ethanol and water or fermented fruit juice. a condenser is used a mixture is heated to just over 80 degrees Celsius (the boiling point of ethanol is 79 degrees Celsius) the ethanol will evaporate and is condensed. It can be collected in a beaker. The water remains in the flask.\n      \n\nDistillation has many applications. For example:\n* Distillation of [[Fermentation (food)|fermented]] products produce [[distilled beverage]]s with a high [[Ethanol|alcohol]] content or separate other fermentation products of commercial value.\n* Distillation is an effective and traditional method of [[desalination]].\n* In the [[petroleum]] industry, oil stabilization is a form of partial distillation that reduces the vapor pressure of crude oil, thereby making it safe for storage and transport as well as reducing the atmospheric emissions of volatile hydrocarbons. In midstream operations at [[oil refinery|oil refineries]], [[fractional distillation]] is a major class of [[unit operation|operation]] for transforming [[crude oil]] into [[fuel]]s and chemical [[raw material|feed stocks]].<ref>Schaschke, C., 2014.

Both [[alembic]]s and retorts are forms of [[Laboratory glassware|glassware]] with long necks pointing to the side at a downward angle to act as air-cooled [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condensers]] to [[Condensation|condense]] the distillate and let it drip downward for collection. Later, copper alembics were invented. Riveted joints were often kept tight by using various mixtures, for instance a dough made of rye flour.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121104173651/http://www.copper-alembic.com/manufacturing/specs_sealing.php Sealing Technique], accessed 16 November 2006.</ref> These alembics often featured a cooling system around the beak, using cold water, for instance, which made the condensation of alcohol more efficient. These were called [[pot still]]s. Today, the retorts and pot stills have been largely supplanted by more efficient distillation methods in most industrial processes. However, the pot still is still widely used for the elaboration of some fine alcohols, such as [[cognac (drink)|cognac]], [[Scotch whisky]], Irish whiskey, [[tequila]], and some [[vodka]]s. Pot stills made of various materials (wood, clay, stainless steel) are also used by [[Rum-runner|bootleggers]] in various countries. Small pot stills are also sold for use in the domestic production<ref>[http://www.essentialoil.com/alembic5.html Traditional Alembic Pot Still] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121163501/https://www.essentialoil.com/alembic5.html |date=21 November 2006 }}, accessed 16 November 2006.</ref> of flower water or [[essential oils]].\n\nEarly forms of distillation involved batch processes using one vaporization and one condensation. Purity was improved by further distillation of the condensate. Greater volumes were processed by simply repeating the distillation. Chemists reportedly carried out as many as 500 to 600 distillations in order to obtain a pure compound.<ref name=Othmer>Othmer, D. F.

The developing [[petroleum]] industry in the early 20th century provided the impetus for the development of accurate design methods, such as the [[McCabe\u2013Thiele method]] by [[Ernest Thiele]] and the [[Fenske equation]]. The first industrial plant in the United States to use distillation as a means of ocean desalination opened in [[Freeport, Texas]] in 1961 with the hope of bringing [[water security]] to the region.<ref name=\"Transcript\">{{cite web |title=Making the Deserts Bloom: Harnessing nature to deliver us from drought, Distillations Podcast and transcript, Episode 239 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/podcast/making-the-deserts-bloom |website=Science History Institute|date=March 19, 2019 |accessdate=27 August 2019}}</ref>\nThe availability of powerful computers has allowed direct [[computer simulation]]s of distillation columns.\n\n==Applications of distillation==\nThe application of distillation can roughly be divided into four groups: [[#Laboratory scale distillation|laboratory scale]], [[#Industrial distillation|industrial distillation]], distillation of herbs for perfumery and medicinals ([[herbal distillate]]), and [[#Distillation in food processing|food processing]]. The latter two are distinctively different from the former two in that distillation is not used as a true purification method but more to transfer all [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatiles]] from the source materials to the distillate in the processing of beverages and herbs.\n\nThe main difference between laboratory scale distillation and industrial distillation are that laboratory scale distillation is often performed on a batch basis, whereas industrial distillation often occurs continuously. In [[batch distillation]], the composition of the source material, the vapors of the distilling compounds, and the distillate change during the distillation. In batch distillation, a still is charged (supplied) with a batch of feed mixture, which is then separated into its component fractions, which are collected sequentially from most volatile to less volatile, with the bottoms \u2013 remaining least or non-volatile fraction \u2013 removed at the end. The still can then be recharged and the process repeated.\n\nIn [[continuous distillation]], the source materials, vapors, and distillate are kept at a constant composition by carefully replenishing the source material and removing fractions from both vapor and liquid in the system. This results in a more detailed control of the separation process.\n\n==Idealized distillation model==\nThe [[boiling point]] of a liquid is the temperature at which the [[vapor pressure]] of the liquid equals the pressure around the liquid, enabling bubbles to form without being crushed. A special case is the [[normal boiling point]], where the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the ambient [[atmospheric pressure]].\n\nIt is a common misconception that in a liquid mixture at a given pressure, each component boils at the boiling point corresponding to the given pressure, allowing the vapors of each component to collect separately and purely. However, this does not occur, even in an idealized system. Idealized models of distillation are essentially governed by [[Raoult's law]] and [[Dalton's law]] and assume that [[Vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium|vapor\u2013liquid equilibria]] are attained.\n\nRaoult's law states that the vapor pressure of a solution is dependent on 1) the vapor pressure of each chemical component in the solution and 2) the fraction of solution each component makes up, a.k.a. the [[mole fraction]]. This law applies to [[ideal solution]]s, or solutions that have different components but whose molecular interactions are the same as or very similar to pure solutions.\n\nDalton's law states that the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of each individual component in the mixture. When a multi-component liquid is heated, the vapor pressure of each component will rise, thus causing the total vapor pressure to rise. When the total vapor pressure reaches the pressure surrounding the liquid, [[boiling]] occurs and liquid turns to gas throughout the bulk of the liquid. A mixture with a given composition has one boiling point at a given pressure when the components are mutually soluble. A mixture of constant composition does not have multiple boiling points.\n\nAn implication of one boiling point is that lighter components never cleanly \"boil first\". At boiling point, all volatile components boil, but for a component, its percentage in the vapor is the same as its percentage of the total vapor pressure. Lighter components have a higher partial pressure and, thus, are concentrated in the vapor, but heavier volatile components also have a (smaller) partial pressure and necessarily vaporize also, albeit at a lower concentration in the vapor. Indeed, batch distillation and fractionation succeed by varying the composition of the mixture. In batch distillation, the batch vaporizes, which changes its composition; in fractionation, liquid higher in the fractionation column contains more lights and boils at lower temperatures. Therefore, starting from a given mixture, it appears to have a boiling range instead of a boiling point, although this is because its composition changes: each intermediate mixture has its own, singular boiling point.\n\nThe idealized model is accurate in the case of chemically similar liquids, such as [[benzene]] and [[toluene]]. In other cases, severe deviations from Raoult's law and Dalton's law are observed, most famously in the mixture of ethanol and water. These compounds, when heated together, form an [[azeotrope]], which is when the vapor phase and liquid phase contain the same composition. Although there are [[computational chemistry|computational methods]] that can be used to estimate the behavior of a mixture of arbitrary components, the only way to obtain accurate [[vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium]] data is by measurement.\n\nIt is not possible to completely purify a mixture of components by distillation, as this would require each component in the mixture to have a zero [[partial pressure]]. If ultra-pure products are the goal, then further [[Separation of chemicals|chemical separation]] must be applied. When a binary mixture is vaporized and the other component, e.g., a salt, has zero partial pressure for practical purposes, the process is simpler.\n\n===Batch or differential distillation===\n\n[[File:BatchDistill.svg|thumb|left|A batch still showing the separation of A and B.]]\nHeating an ideal mixture of two volatile substances, A and B, with A having the higher volatility, or lower boiling point, in a batch distillation setup (such as in an apparatus depicted in the opening figure) until the mixture is boiling results in a vapor above the liquid that contains a mixture of A and B. The ratio between A and B in the vapor will be different from the ratio in the liquid. The ratio in the liquid will be determined by how the original mixture was prepared, while the ratio in the vapor will be enriched in the more volatile compound, A (due to Raoult's Law, see above). The vapor goes through the condenser and is removed from the system. This, in turn, means that the ratio of compounds in the remaining liquid is now different from the initial ratio (i.e., more enriched in B than in the starting liquid).\n\nThe result is that the ratio in the liquid mixture is changing, becoming richer in component B. This causes the boiling point of the mixture to rise, which results in a rise in the temperature in the vapor, which results in a changing ratio of A : B in the gas phase (as distillation continues, there is an increasing proportion of B in the gas phase). This results in a slowly changing ratio of A : B in the distillate.\n\nIf the difference in vapor pressure between the two components A and B is large \u2013 generally expressed as the difference in boiling points \u2013 the mixture in the beginning of the distillation is highly enriched in component A, and when component A has distilled off, the boiling liquid is enriched in component B.\n\n===Continuous distillation===\n{{Main|Continuous distillation}}\n\nContinuous distillation is an ongoing distillation in which a liquid mixture is continuously (without interruption) fed into the process and separated fractions are removed continuously as output streams occur over time during the operation. Continuous distillation produces a minimum of two output fractions, including at least one [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] distillate fraction, which has boiled and been separately captured as a vapor and then condensed to a liquid. There is always a bottoms (or residue) fraction, which is the least volatile residue that has not been separately captured as a condensed vapor.\n\nContinuous distillation differs from batch distillation in the respect that concentrations should not change over time. Continuous distillation can be run at a [[steady state]] for an arbitrary amount of time. For any source material of specific composition, the main variables that affect the purity of products in continuous distillation are the reflux ratio and the number of theoretical equilibrium stages, in practice determined by the number of trays or the height of packing. Reflux is a flow from the condenser back to the column, which generates a recycle that allows a better separation with a given number of trays. Equilibrium stages are ideal steps where compositions achieve vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium, repeating the separation process and allowing better separation given a reflux ratio. A column with a high reflux ratio may have fewer stages, but it refluxes a large amount of liquid, giving a wide column with a large holdup. Conversely, a column with a low reflux ratio must have a large number of stages, thus requiring a taller column.\n\n===General improvements===\nBoth batch and continuous distillations can be improved by making use of a [[fractionating column]] on top of the distillation flask. The column improves separation by providing a larger surface area for the vapor and condensate to come into contact. This helps it remain at equilibrium for as long as possible. The column can even consist of small subsystems ('trays' or 'dishes') which all contain an enriched, boiling liquid mixture, all with their own vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium.\n\nThere are differences between laboratory-scale and industrial-scale fractionating columns, but the principles are the same. Examples of laboratory-scale fractionating columns (in increasing efficiency) include\n* [[Condenser (laboratory)#Air condenser|Air condenser]]\n* [[Vigreux column]] (usually laboratory scale only)\n* [[Packed bed|Packed column]] (packed with glass beads, metal pieces, or other chemically inert material)\n* [[Spinning band distillation]] system.\n\n==Laboratory scale distillation==\nLaboratory scale distillations are almost exclusively run as batch distillations. The device used in distillation, sometimes referred to as a ''[[still]]'', consists at a minimum of a '''reboiler''' or ''pot'' in which the source material is heated, a '''condenser''' in which the heated [[gas|vapor]] is cooled back to the liquid [[phase (matter)|state]], and a '''receiver''' in which the concentrated or purified liquid, called the '''distillate''', is collected. Several laboratory scale techniques for distillation exist (see also [[:Category:Distillation|distillation types]]).\n\nA completely sealed distillation apparatus could experience extreme and rapidly varying internal pressure, which could cause it to burst open at the joints.  Therefore, some path is usually left open (for instance, at the receiving flask) to allow the internal pressure to equalize with atmospheric pressure. Alternatively, a [[vacuum pump]] may be used to keep the apparatus at a lower than atmospheric pressure.  If the substances involved are air- or moisture-sensitive, the connection to the atmosphere can be made through one or more [[drying tube]]s packed with materials that scavenge the undesired air components, or through [[bubbler]]s that provide a movable liquid barrier.  Finally, the entry of undesired air components can be prevented by pumping a low but steady flow of suitable inert gas, like [[nitrogen]], into the apparatus.\n\n===Simple distillation===\n[[File:Simple distillation apparatus.svg|300 px|thumb|right|Schematic of a simple distillation setup.]]\nIn '''simple distillation''', the vapor is immediately channeled into a condenser. Consequently, the distillate is not pure but rather its composition is identical to the composition of the vapors at the given temperature and pressure. That concentration follows [[Raoult's law]].\n\nAs a result, simple distillation is effective only when the liquid boiling points differ greatly (rule of thumb is 25&nbsp;\u00b0C)<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080908000656/http://www.iupac.org/didac/Didac%20Eng/Didac05/Content/ST07.htm ST07 Separation of liquid\u2013liquid mixtures (solutions)], DIDAC by [[IUPAC]]</ref> or when separating liquids from non-volatile solids or oils. For these cases, the vapor pressures of the components are usually different enough that the distillate may be sufficiently pure for its intended purpose.\n\nA cutaway schematic of a simple distillation operation is shown at left. The starting liquid '''15''' in the boiling flask '''2''' is heated by a combined [[hotplate]] and [[magnetic stirrer]] '''13''' via a [[silicone oil]] bath (orange, '''14'''). The vapor flows through a short [[Vigreux column]] '''3''', then through a [[Liebig condenser]] '''5''', is cooled by water (blue) that circulates through ports '''6''' and '''7'''. The condensed liquid drips into the receiving flask '''8''', sitting in a cooling bath (blue, '''16'''). The adapter '''10''' has a connection '''9''' that may be fitted to a vacuum pump. The components are connected by [[ground glass joint]]s (gray).\n\n===Fractional distillation===\n{{Main|Fractional distillation}}\n[[File:Double Distilled Water Unit.jpg|right|thumb|450px|Typical laboratory fractional distillation unit]]\nFor many cases, the boiling points of the components in the mixture will be sufficiently close that [[Raoult's law]] must be taken into consideration. Therefore, '''fractional distillation''' must be used in order to separate the components by repeated vaporization-condensation cycles within a packed fractionating column. This separation, by successive distillations, is also referred to as '''rectification'''.<ref name=Perry/>\n\nAs the solution to be purified is heated, its vapors rise to the [[fractionating column]]. As it rises, it cools, condensing on the condenser walls and the surfaces of the packing material. Here, the condensate continues to be heated by the rising hot vapors; it vaporizes once more. However, the composition of the fresh vapors are determined once again by Raoult's law. Each vaporization-condensation cycle (called a ''[[theoretical plate]]'') will yield a purer solution of the more volatile component.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070903202418/http://wulfenite.fandm.edu/labtech/fractdistill.htm Fractional Distillation]. fandm.edu</ref> In reality, each cycle at a given temperature does not occur at exactly the same position in the fractionating column; ''theoretical plate'' is thus a concept rather than an accurate description.\n\nMore theoretical plates lead to better separations. A [[spinning band distillation]] system uses a spinning band of [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]] or metal to force the rising vapors into close contact with the descending condensate, increasing the number of theoretical plates.<ref>[http://www.brinstrument.com/fractional-distillation/spinning_band_distillation.html Spinning Band Distillation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825161209/http://www.brinstrument.com/fractional-distillation/spinning_band_distillation.html |date=25 August 2006 }}. B/R Instrument Corporation (accessed 8 September 2006)</ref>\n\n===Steam distillation===\n{{Main|Steam distillation}}\nLike [[vacuum distillation]], '''steam distillation''' is a method for distilling compounds which are heat-sensitive.<ref>{{harvnb|Harwood|Moody|1989|pp=151\u2013153}}</ref> The temperature of the steam is easier to control than the surface of a [[heating element]], and allows a high rate of heat transfer without heating at a very high temperature. This process involves bubbling steam through a heated mixture of the raw material. By Raoult's law, some of the target compound will vaporize (in accordance with its partial pressure). The vapor mixture is cooled and condensed, usually yielding a layer of oil and a layer of water.\n\nSteam distillation of various [[aroma|aromatic]] herbs and flowers can result in two products; an [[essential oil]] as well as a watery [[herbal distillate]]. The [[essential oils]] are often used in perfumery and [[aromatherapy]] while the watery distillates have many applications in [[aromatherapy]], [[food processing]] and [[skin care]].\n\n[[File:Vacuum distillation of DMSO at 70C.jpg|left|thumb|[[Dimethyl sulfoxide]] usually boils at 189 \u00b0C. Under a vacuum, it distills off into the receiver at only 70 \u00b0C.]]\n[[File:perkin triangle distillation apparatus.svg|thumb|'''Perkin triangle distillation setup'''<br /> '''1:''' Stirrer bar/anti-bumping granules '''2:''' Still pot '''3:''' Fractionating column '''4:''' Thermometer/Boiling point temperature '''5:''' Teflon tap 1 '''6:''' Cold finger '''7:''' Cooling water out '''8:''' Cooling water in '''9:''' Teflon tap 2 '''10:''' Vacuum/gas inlet '''11:''' Teflon tap 3 '''12:''' Still receiver]]\n\n===Vacuum distillation===\n{{Main|Vacuum distillation}}\nSome compounds have very high boiling points. To boil such compounds, it is often better to lower the pressure at which such compounds are boiled instead of increasing the temperature. Once the pressure is lowered to the vapor pressure of the compound (at the given temperature), boiling and the rest of the distillation process can commence. This technique is referred to as '''vacuum distillation''' and it is commonly found in the laboratory in the form of the [[rotary evaporator]].\n\nThis technique is also very useful for compounds which boil beyond their [[decomposition temperature]] at atmospheric pressure and which would therefore be decomposed by any attempt to boil them under atmospheric pressure.\n\n[[Molecular distillation]] is vacuum distillation below the pressure of 0.01 [[torr]]. 0.01 torr is one order of magnitude above [[Hard vacuum|high vacuum]], where fluids are in the [[free molecular flow]] regime, i.e. the [[mean free path]] of molecules is comparable to the size of the equipment. The gaseous phase no longer exerts significant pressure on the substance to be evaporated, and consequently, rate of evaporation no longer depends on pressure. That is, because the continuum assumptions of fluid dynamics no longer apply, mass transport is governed by molecular dynamics rather than fluid dynamics. Thus, a short path between the hot surface and the cold surface is necessary, typically by suspending a hot plate covered with a film of feed next to a cold plate with a line of sight in between. Molecular distillation is used industrially for purification of oils.\n\n===Air-sensitive vacuum distillation===\nSome compounds have high boiling points as well as being [[air sensitive]]. A simple vacuum distillation system as exemplified above can be used, whereby the vacuum is replaced with an inert gas after the distillation is complete. However, this is a less satisfactory system if one desires to collect fractions under a reduced pressure. To do this a \"cow\" or \"pig\" adaptor can be added to the end of the condenser, or for better results or for very air sensitive compounds a [[Perkin triangle]] apparatus can be used.\n\nThe Perkin triangle, has means via a series of glass or [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]] taps to allows fractions to be isolated from the rest of the [[still]], without the main body of the distillation being removed from either the vacuum or heat source, and thus can remain in a state of [[reflux]]. To do this, the sample is first isolated from the vacuum by means of the taps, the vacuum over the sample is then replaced with an inert gas (such as [[nitrogen]] or [[argon]]) and can then be stoppered and removed. A fresh collection vessel can then be added to the system, evacuated and linked back into the distillation system via the taps to collect a second fraction, and so on, until all fractions have been collected.\n\n===Short path distillation===\n[[File:short path distillation apparatus.svg|thumb|right|Short path vacuum distillation apparatus with vertical condenser (cold finger), to minimize the distillation path; '''1: '''Still pot with stirrer bar/anti-bumping granules '''2:''' Cold finger \u2013 bent to direct condensate '''3: '''Cooling water out '''4:''' cooling water in '''5: '''Vacuum/gas inlet '''6:''' Distillate flask/distillate.]]\n[[Short path distillation]] is a distillation technique that involves the distillate travelling a short distance, often only a few centimeters, and is normally done at reduced pressure.<ref>{{harvnb|Harwood|Moody|1989|p=150}}</ref> A classic example would be a distillation involving the distillate travelling from one glass bulb to another, without the need for a condenser separating the two chambers. This technique is often used for compounds which are unstable at high temperatures or to purify small amounts of compound. The advantage is that the heating temperature can be considerably lower (at reduced pressure) than the boiling point of the liquid at standard pressure, and the distillate only has to travel a short distance before condensing. A short path ensures that little compound is lost on the sides of the apparatus. The [[Kugelrohr]] is a kind of a short path distillation apparatus which often contain multiple chambers to collect distillate fractions.\n\n===Zone distillation===\nZone distillation is a distillation process in long container with partial melting of refined matter in moving liquid zone and condensation of vapor in the solid phase at condensate pulling in cold area. The process is worked in theory. When zone heater is moving from the top to the bottom of the container then solid condensate with irregular impurity distribution is forming. Then most pure part of the condensate may be extracted as product. The process may be iterated many times by moving (without turnover) the received condensate to the bottom part of the container on the place of refined matter. The irregular impurity distribution in the condensate (that is efficiency of purification) increases with the number of iterations.\nZone distillation is the distillation analog of zone recrystallization. Impurity distribution in the condensate is described by known equations of zone recrystallization  \u2013 with the replacement of the distribution co-efficient k of crystallization - for the separation factor \u03b1 of distillation.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kravchenko |first=A.

In this process, the product is usually significantly lower-boiling than its reactants. As the product is formed from the reactants, it is vaporized and removed from the reaction mixture. This technique is an example of a continuous vs. a batch process; advantages include less downtime to charge the reaction vessel with starting material, and less workup. Distillation \"over a reactant\" could be classified as a reactive distillation. It is typically used to remove volatile impurity from the distallation feed. For example, a little [[lime (material)|lime]] may be added to remove carbon dioxide from water followed by a second distillation with a little [[sulfuric acid]] added to remove traces of ammonia.\n* [[Catalytic distillation]] is the process by which the reactants are catalyzed while being distilled to continuously separate the products from the reactants. This method is used to assist equilibrium reactions reach completion.\n* [[Pervaporation]] is a method for the separation of mixtures of liquids by partial vaporization through a non-porous [[Artificial membrane|membrane]].\n* [[Extractive distillation]] is defined as distillation in the presence of a miscible, high boiling, relatively non-volatile component, the solvent, that forms no [[azeotrope]] with the other components in the mixture.\n* [[Flash evaporation]] (or partial evaporation) is the partial [[vaporization]] that occurs when a saturated liquid stream undergoes a reduction in pressure by passing through a throttling [[valve]] or other throttling device. This process is one of the simplest unit operations, being equivalent to a distillation with only one equilibrium stage.\n* Codistillation is distillation which is performed on mixtures in which the two compounds are not miscible. In the laboratory, the [[Dean-Stark apparatus]] is used for this purpose to remove water from synthesis products. The Bleidner is another example with two refluxing solvents.\n* Membrane distillation is a type of distillation in which vapors of a mixture to be separated are passed through a membrane, which selectively permeates one component of mixture. Vapor pressure difference is the driving force. It has potential applications in seawater desalination and in removal of organic and inorganic components.\n\nThe unit process of [[evaporation]] may also be called \"distillation\":\n* In [[rotary evaporation]] a vacuum distillation apparatus is used to remove bulk [[solvent]]s from a sample. Typically the vacuum is generated by a [[aspirator (pump)|water aspirator]] or a [[membrane pump]].\n* In a [[kugelrohr]] a short path distillation apparatus is typically used (generally in combination with a (high) vacuum) to distill high boiling (> 300&nbsp;\u00b0C) compounds. The apparatus consists of an oven in which the compound to be distilled is placed, a receiving portion which is outside of the oven, and a means of rotating the sample. The vacuum is normally generated by using a high vacuum pump.\n\nOther uses:\n* [[Dry distillation]] or [[destructive distillation]], despite the name, is not truly distillation, but rather a [[chemical reaction]] known as [[pyrolysis]] in which solid substances are heated in an inert or [[redox|reducing]] atmosphere and any volatile fractions, containing high-boiling liquids and products of pyrolysis, are collected. The destructive distillation of [[wood]] to give [[methanol]] is the root of its common name \u2013 ''wood alcohol''.\n* [[Freeze distillation]] is an analogous method of purification using [[freezing]] instead of evaporation. It is not truly distillation, but a [[Recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallization]] where the product is the [[mother liquor]], and does not produce products equivalent to distillation. This process is used in the production of [[American-style lager#Ice beer|ice beer]] and [[ice wine]] to increase ethanol and [[sugar]] content, respectively. It is also used to produce [[Applejack (beverage)|applejack]]. Unlike distillation, freeze distillation concentrates poisonous congeners rather than removing them; As a result, many countries prohibit such applejack as a health measure. Also, distillation by evaporation can separate these since they have different boiling points.\n\n==Azeotropic distillation==\n{{Main|Azeotropic distillation}}\nInteractions between the components of the solution create properties unique to the solution, as most processes entail nonideal mixtures, where [[Raoult's law]] does not hold. Such interactions can result in a constant-boiling '''[[azeotrope]]''' which behaves as if it were a pure compound (i.e., boils at a single temperature instead of a range). At an azeotrope, the solution contains the given component in the same proportion as the vapor, so that evaporation does not change the purity, and distillation does not effect separation. For example, [[Ethanol|ethyl alcohol]] and [[Water (molecule)|water]] form an azeotrope of 95.6% at 78.1&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nIf the azeotrope is not considered sufficiently pure for use, there exist some techniques to break the azeotrope to give a pure distillate. This set of techniques are known as '''azeotropic distillation'''. Some techniques achieve this by \"jumping\" over the azeotropic composition (by adding another component to create a new azeotrope, or by varying the pressure). Others work by chemically or physically removing or sequestering the impurity. For example, to purify ethanol beyond 95%, a drying agent (or [[desiccant]], such as [[potassium carbonate]]) can be added to convert the soluble water into insoluble [[water of crystallization]]. [[Molecular sieve]]s are often used for this purpose as well.\n\nImmiscible liquids, such as water and [[toluene]], easily form azeotropes. Commonly, these azeotropes are referred to as a low boiling azeotrope because the boiling point of the azeotrope is lower than the boiling point of either pure component. The temperature and composition of the azeotrope is easily predicted from the vapor pressure of the pure components, without use of Raoult's law. The azeotrope is easily broken in a distillation set-up by using a liquid\u2013liquid separator (a decanter) to separate the two liquid layers that are condensed overhead. Only one of the two liquid layers is refluxed to the distillation set-up.\n\nHigh boiling azeotropes, such as a 20 weight percent mixture of hydrochloric acid in water, also exist. As implied by the name, the boiling point of the azeotrope is greater than the boiling point of either pure component.\n\nTo break azeotropic distillations and cross distillation boundaries, such as in the DeRosier Problem, it is necessary to increase the composition of the light key in the distillate.\n\n===Breaking an azeotrope with unidirectional pressure manipulation===\nThe boiling points of components in an azeotrope overlap to form a band. By exposing an azeotrope to a vacuum or positive pressure, it's possible to bias the boiling point of one component away from the other by exploiting the differing vapor pressure curves of each; the curves may overlap at the azeotropic point, but are unlikely to be remain identical further along the pressure axis either side of the azeotropic point. When the bias is great enough, the two boiling points no longer overlap and so the azeotropic band disappears.\n\nThis method can remove the need to add other chemicals to a distillation, but it has two potential drawbacks.\n\nUnder negative pressure, power for a vacuum source is needed and the reduced boiling points of the distillates requires that the condenser be run cooler to prevent distillate vapors being lost to the vacuum source. Increased cooling demands will often require additional energy and possibly new equipment or a change of coolant.\n\nAlternatively, if positive pressures are required, standard glassware can not be used, energy must be used for pressurization and there is a higher chance of side reactions occurring in the distillation, such as decomposition, due to the higher temperatures required to effect boiling.\n\nA unidirectional distillation will rely on a pressure change in one direction, either positive or negative.\n\n===Pressure-swing distillation===\n{{further|Azeotrope#Pressure swing distillation}}\n\nPressure-swing distillation is essentially the same as the unidirectional distillation used to break azeotropic mixtures, but here both [[Azeotrope#Pressure swing distillation|positive and negative pressures may be employed]].\n\nThis improves the selectivity of the distillation and allows a chemist to optimize distillation by avoiding extremes of pressure and temperature that waste energy. This is particularly important in commercial applications.\n\nOne example of the application of pressure-swing distillation is during the industrial purification of [[ethyl acetate]] after its catalytic synthesis from [[ethanol]].\n\n==Industrial distillation==\n[[File:Colonne distillazione.jpg|right|thumb|Typical industrial distillation towers]]\n{{Main|Continuous distillation}}\nLarge scale '''industrial distillation''' applications include both batch and continuous fractional, vacuum, azeotropic, extractive, and steam distillation. The most widely used industrial applications of continuous, steady-state fractional distillation are in [[oil refinery|petroleum refineries]], [[petrochemical]] and [[chemical plant]]s and [[natural gas processing]] plants.\n\nTo control and optimize such industrial distillation, a standardized laboratory method, ASTM D86, is established. This test method extends to the atmospheric distillation of petroleum products using a laboratory batch distillation unit to quantitatively determine the boiling range characteristics of petroleum products.\n\nIndustrial distillation<ref name=Perry>{{cite book|author1=Perry, Robert H.  |author2=Green, Don W.|title=Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook|edition=6th| publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1984|isbn=978-0-07-049479-4|title-link=Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook}}</ref><ref name=Kister>{{cite book|author=Kister, Henry Z.|title=Distillation Design|edition=1st |publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1992|isbn=978-0-07-034909-4|title-link=Distillation Design}}</ref> is typically performed in large, vertical cylindrical columns known as '''distillation towers''' or '''distillation columns''' with diameters ranging from about 65&nbsp;centimeters to 16&nbsp;meters and heights ranging from about 6&nbsp;meters to 90&nbsp;meters or more. When the process feed has a diverse composition, as in distilling [[crude oil]], liquid outlets at intervals up the column allow for the withdrawal of different ''fractions'' or products having different [[boiling points]] or boiling ranges. The \"lightest\" products (those with the lowest boiling point) exit from the top of the columns and the \"heaviest\" products (those with the highest boiling point) exit from the bottom of the column and are often called the '''bottoms'''.\n\n[[File:Continuous Binary Fractional Distillation.PNG|left|thumb|Diagram of a typical industrial distillation tower]]\nIndustrial towers use [[reflux]] to achieve a more complete separation of products. Reflux refers to the portion of the condensed overhead liquid product from a distillation or fractionation tower that is returned to the upper part of the tower as shown in the schematic diagram of a typical, large-scale industrial distillation tower. Inside the tower, the downflowing reflux liquid provides cooling and condensation of the upflowing vapors thereby increasing the efficiency of the distillation tower. The more reflux that is provided for a given number of [[theoretical plate]]s, the better the tower's separation of lower boiling materials from higher boiling materials. Alternatively, the more reflux that is provided for a given desired separation, the fewer the number of theoretical plates required. [[Chemical engineer]]s must choose what combination of reflux rate and number of plates is both economically and physically feasible for the products purified in the distillation column.\n\nSuch industrial fractionating towers are also used in [[cryogenic]] [[air separation]], producing [[liquid oxygen]], [[liquid nitrogen]], and high purity [[argon]]. Distillation of [[chlorosilane]]s also enables the production of high-purity [[silicon]] for use as a [[semiconductor]].\n\n[[File:Bubble Cap Trays.PNG|frame|right|Section of an industrial distillation tower showing detail of trays with bubble caps]]\nDesign and operation of a distillation tower depends on the feed and desired products. Given a simple, binary component feed, analytical methods such as the [[McCabe\u2013Thiele method]]<ref name=Perry/><ref name=SeaderHenley>{{cite book|author1=Seader, J. D.  |author2=Henley, Ernest J.|title=Separation Process Principles|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|year=1998|isbn=978-0-471-58626-5}}</ref> or the [[Fenske equation]]<ref name=Perry/> can be used. For a multi-component feed, [[simulation]] models are used both for design and operation. Moreover, the efficiencies of the vapor\u2013liquid contact devices (referred to as \"plates\" or \"trays\") used in distillation towers are typically lower than that of a theoretical 100% efficient [[equilibrium stage]]. Hence, a distillation tower needs more trays than the number of theoretical vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium stages. A variety of models have been postulated to estimate tray efficiencies.\n\nIn modern industrial uses, a packing material is used in the column instead of trays when low pressure drops across the column are required. Other factors that favor packing are: vacuum systems, smaller diameter columns, corrosive systems, systems prone to foaming, systems requiring low liquid holdup, and batch distillation. Conversely, factors that favor [[plate column]]s are: presence of solids in feed, high liquid rates, large column diameters, complex columns, columns with wide feed composition variation, columns with a chemical reaction, absorption columns, columns limited by foundation weight tolerance, low liquid rate, large turn-down ratio and those processes subject to process surges.\n[[File:Vacuum Column.jpg|thumb|left|183px|Large-scale, industrial vacuum distillation column<ref>[http://resources.schoolscience.co.uk/SPE/knowl/4/2index.htm?vacuum.html Energy Institute website page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012072758/http://resources.schoolscience.co.uk/SPE/knowl/4/2index.htm?vacuum.html |date=12 October 2007 }}.

Retrieved on 2014-04-20.</ref>]]\nThis packing material can either be random dumped packing (1\u20133\" wide) such as [[Raschig ring]]s or [[structured packing|structured sheet metal]]. Liquids tend to wet the surface of the packing and the vapors pass across this wetted surface, where [[mass transfer]] takes place. Unlike conventional tray distillation in which every tray represents a separate point of vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium, the vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium curve in a packed column is continuous. However, when modeling packed columns, it is useful to compute a number of \"theoretical stages\" to denote the separation efficiency of the packed column with respect to more traditional trays. Differently shaped packings have different surface areas and void space between packings. Both of these factors affect packing performance.\n\nAnother factor in addition to the packing shape and surface area that affects the performance of random or structured packing is the liquid and vapor distribution entering the packed bed. The number of [[Theoretical plate|theoretical stages]] required to make a given separation is calculated using a specific vapor to liquid ratio. If the liquid and vapor are not evenly distributed across the superficial tower area as it enters the packed bed, the liquid to vapor ratio will not be correct in the packed bed and the required separation will not be achieved. The packing will appear to not be working properly. The [[Theoretical plate|height equivalent to a theoretical plate]] (HETP) will be greater than expected. The problem is not the packing itself but the mal-distribution of the fluids entering the packed bed. Liquid mal-distribution is more frequently the problem than vapor. The design of the liquid distributors used to introduce the feed and reflux to a packed bed is critical to making the packing perform to it maximum efficiency. Methods of evaluating the effectiveness of a liquid distributor to evenly distribute the liquid entering a packed bed can be found in references.<ref name=Moore>Moore, F., Rukovena, F.

Components other than ethanol, including water, esters, and other alcohols, are collected in the condensate, which account for the flavor of the beverage. Some of these beverages are then stored in barrels or other containers to acquire more flavor compounds and characteristic flavors.\n\n==Gallery==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|[[File:Retort-in-operation-early-chemistry.png|100px]]|| Chemistry in its beginnings used [[retort]]s as [[laboratory equipment]] exclusively for distillation processes.\n|-\n|[[File:Distillation of dry and oxygen-free toluene.jpg|100px]]|| A simple set-up to distill dry and oxygen-free [[toluene]].\n|-\n|[[File:Vacuum Column.png|100px]]||Diagram of an industrial-scale vacuum distillation column as commonly used in [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]]\n|-\n|[[File:Rotavapor.jpg|100px]]|| A [[rotary evaporator]] is able to distill solvents more quickly at lower temperatures through the use of a [[vacuum]].\n|-\n|[[File:Semi-microscale distillation.jpg|100px]]|| Distillation using semi-microscale apparatus.

Distillation may result in essentially complete separation (nearly pure components), or it may be a partial separation that increases the concentration of selected components in the mixture. In either case, the process exploits differences in the [[Volatility (physics)|relative volatility]] of the mixture's components. In [[Chemical industry|industrial chemistry]], distillation is a [[unit operation]] of practically universal importance, but it is a physical separation process, not a [[chemical reaction]]. Distillation can also be used to separate a solution made of two or more liquids or fractions, they are called miscible liquids and they must have different boiling points, for example, ethanol and water or fermented fruit juice. a condenser is used a mixture is heated to just over 80 degrees Celsius (the boiling point of ethanol is 79 degrees Celsius) the ethanol will evaporate and is condensed. It can be collected in a beaker. The water remains in the flask.\n      \n\nDistillation has many applications. For example:\n* Distillation of [[Fermentation (food)|fermented]] products produce [[distilled beverage]]s with a high [[Ethanol|alcohol]] content or separate other fermentation products of commercial value.\n* Distillation is an effective and traditional method of [[desalination]].\n* In the [[petroleum]] industry, oil stabilization is a form of partial distillation that reduces the vapor pressure of crude oil, thereby making it safe for storage and transport as well as reducing the atmospheric emissions of volatile hydrocarbons. In midstream operations at [[oil refinery|oil refineries]], [[fractional distillation]] is a major class of [[unit operation|operation]] for transforming [[crude oil]] into [[fuel]]s and chemical [[raw material|feed stocks]].<ref>Schaschke, C., 2014.

Both [[alembic]]s and retorts are forms of [[Laboratory glassware|glassware]] with long necks pointing to the side at a downward angle to act as air-cooled [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condensers]] to [[Condensation|condense]] the distillate and let it drip downward for collection. Later, copper alembics were invented. Riveted joints were often kept tight by using various mixtures, for instance a dough made of rye flour.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121104173651/http://www.copper-alembic.com/manufacturing/specs_sealing.php Sealing Technique], accessed 16 November 2006.</ref> These alembics often featured a cooling system around the beak, using cold water, for instance, which made the condensation of alcohol more efficient. These were called [[pot still]]s. Today, the retorts and pot stills have been largely supplanted by more efficient distillation methods in most industrial processes. However, the pot still is still widely used for the elaboration of some fine alcohols, such as [[cognac (drink)|cognac]], [[Scotch whisky]], Irish whiskey, [[tequila]], and some [[vodka]]s.

Purity was improved by further distillation of the condensate. Greater volumes were processed by simply repeating the distillation.

The developing [[petroleum]] industry in the early 20th century provided the impetus for the development of accurate design methods, such as the [[McCabe\u2013Thiele method]] by [[Ernest Thiele]] and the [[Fenske equation]]. The first industrial plant in the United States to use distillation as a means of ocean desalination opened in [[Freeport, Texas]] in 1961 with the hope of bringing [[water security]] to the region.<ref name=\"Transcript\">{{cite web |title=Making the Deserts Bloom: Harnessing nature to deliver us from drought, Distillations Podcast and transcript, Episode 239 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/podcast/making-the-deserts-bloom |website=Science History Institute|date=March 19, 2019 |accessdate=27 August 2019}}</ref>\nThe availability of powerful computers has allowed direct [[computer simulation]]s of distillation columns.\n\n==Applications of distillation==\nThe application of distillation can roughly be divided into four groups: [[#Laboratory scale distillation|laboratory scale]], [[#Industrial distillation|industrial distillation]], distillation of herbs for perfumery and medicinals ([[herbal distillate]]), and [[#Distillation in food processing|food processing]]. The latter two are distinctively different from the former two in that distillation is not used as a true purification method but more to transfer all [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatiles]] from the source materials to the distillate in the processing of beverages and herbs.\n\nThe main difference between laboratory scale distillation and industrial distillation are that laboratory scale distillation is often performed on a batch basis, whereas industrial distillation often occurs continuously. In [[batch distillation]], the composition of the source material, the vapors of the distilling compounds, and the distillate change during the distillation. In batch distillation, a still is charged (supplied) with a batch of feed mixture, which is then separated into its component fractions, which are collected sequentially from most volatile to less volatile, with the bottoms \u2013 remaining least or non-volatile fraction \u2013 removed at the end. The still can then be recharged and the process repeated.\n\nIn [[continuous distillation]], the source materials, vapors, and distillate are kept at a constant composition by carefully replenishing the source material and removing fractions from both vapor and liquid in the system. This results in a more detailed control of the separation process.\n\n==Idealized distillation model==\nThe [[boiling point]] of a liquid is the temperature at which the [[vapor pressure]] of the liquid equals the pressure around the liquid, enabling bubbles to form without being crushed. A special case is the [[normal boiling point]], where the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the ambient [[atmospheric pressure]].\n\nIt is a common misconception that in a liquid mixture at a given pressure, each component boils at the boiling point corresponding to the given pressure, allowing the vapors of each component to collect separately and purely. However, this does not occur, even in an idealized system. Idealized models of distillation are essentially governed by [[Raoult's law]] and [[Dalton's law]] and assume that [[Vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium|vapor\u2013liquid equilibria]] are attained.\n\nRaoult's law states that the vapor pressure of a solution is dependent on 1) the vapor pressure of each chemical component in the solution and 2) the fraction of solution each component makes up, a.k.a. the [[mole fraction]]. This law applies to [[ideal solution]]s, or solutions that have different components but whose molecular interactions are the same as or very similar to pure solutions.\n\nDalton's law states that the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of each individual component in the mixture. When a multi-component liquid is heated, the vapor pressure of each component will rise, thus causing the total vapor pressure to rise. When the total vapor pressure reaches the pressure surrounding the liquid, [[boiling]] occurs and liquid turns to gas throughout the bulk of the liquid. A mixture with a given composition has one boiling point at a given pressure when the components are mutually soluble. A mixture of constant composition does not have multiple boiling points.\n\nAn implication of one boiling point is that lighter components never cleanly \"boil first\". At boiling point, all volatile components boil, but for a component, its percentage in the vapor is the same as its percentage of the total vapor pressure. Lighter components have a higher partial pressure and, thus, are concentrated in the vapor, but heavier volatile components also have a (smaller) partial pressure and necessarily vaporize also, albeit at a lower concentration in the vapor. Indeed, batch distillation and fractionation succeed by varying the composition of the mixture. In batch distillation, the batch vaporizes, which changes its composition; in fractionation, liquid higher in the fractionation column contains more lights and boils at lower temperatures. Therefore, starting from a given mixture, it appears to have a boiling range instead of a boiling point, although this is because its composition changes: each intermediate mixture has its own, singular boiling point.\n\nThe idealized model is accurate in the case of chemically similar liquids, such as [[benzene]] and [[toluene]]. In other cases, severe deviations from Raoult's law and Dalton's law are observed, most famously in the mixture of ethanol and water. These compounds, when heated together, form an [[azeotrope]], which is when the vapor phase and liquid phase contain the same composition. Although there are [[computational chemistry|computational methods]] that can be used to estimate the behavior of a mixture of arbitrary components, the only way to obtain accurate [[vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium]] data is by measurement.\n\nIt is not possible to completely purify a mixture of components by distillation, as this would require each component in the mixture to have a zero [[partial pressure]]. If ultra-pure products are the goal, then further [[Separation of chemicals|chemical separation]] must be applied. When a binary mixture is vaporized and the other component, e.g., a salt, has zero partial pressure for practical purposes, the process is simpler.\n\n===Batch or differential distillation===\n\n[[File:BatchDistill.svg|thumb|left|A batch still showing the separation of A and B.]]\nHeating an ideal mixture of two volatile substances, A and B, with A having the higher volatility, or lower boiling point, in a batch distillation setup (such as in an apparatus depicted in the opening figure) until the mixture is boiling results in a vapor above the liquid that contains a mixture of A and B. The ratio between A and B in the vapor will be different from the ratio in the liquid. The ratio in the liquid will be determined by how the original mixture was prepared, while the ratio in the vapor will be enriched in the more volatile compound, A (due to Raoult's Law, see above). The vapor goes through the condenser and is removed from the system. This, in turn, means that the ratio of compounds in the remaining liquid is now different from the initial ratio (i.e., more enriched in B than in the starting liquid).\n\nThe result is that the ratio in the liquid mixture is changing, becoming richer in component B. This causes the boiling point of the mixture to rise, which results in a rise in the temperature in the vapor, which results in a changing ratio of A : B in the gas phase (as distillation continues, there is an increasing proportion of B in the gas phase). This results in a slowly changing ratio of A : B in the distillate.\n\nIf the difference in vapor pressure between the two components A and B is large \u2013 generally expressed as the difference in boiling points \u2013 the mixture in the beginning of the distillation is highly enriched in component A, and when component A has distilled off, the boiling liquid is enriched in component B.\n\n===Continuous distillation===\n{{Main|Continuous distillation}}\n\nContinuous distillation is an ongoing distillation in which a liquid mixture is continuously (without interruption) fed into the process and separated fractions are removed continuously as output streams occur over time during the operation. Continuous distillation produces a minimum of two output fractions, including at least one [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] distillate fraction, which has boiled and been separately captured as a vapor and then condensed to a liquid. There is always a bottoms (or residue) fraction, which is the least volatile residue that has not been separately captured as a condensed vapor.\n\nContinuous distillation differs from batch distillation in the respect that concentrations should not change over time. Continuous distillation can be run at a [[steady state]] for an arbitrary amount of time. For any source material of specific composition, the main variables that affect the purity of products in continuous distillation are the reflux ratio and the number of theoretical equilibrium stages, in practice determined by the number of trays or the height of packing. Reflux is a flow from the condenser back to the column, which generates a recycle that allows a better separation with a given number of trays. Equilibrium stages are ideal steps where compositions achieve vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium, repeating the separation process and allowing better separation given a reflux ratio. A column with a high reflux ratio may have fewer stages, but it refluxes a large amount of liquid, giving a wide column with a large holdup. Conversely, a column with a low reflux ratio must have a large number of stages, thus requiring a taller column.\n\n===General improvements===\nBoth batch and continuous distillations can be improved by making use of a [[fractionating column]] on top of the distillation flask. The column improves separation by providing a larger surface area for the vapor and condensate to come into contact. This helps it remain at equilibrium for as long as possible. The column can even consist of small subsystems ('trays' or 'dishes') which all contain an enriched, boiling liquid mixture, all with their own vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium.\n\nThere are differences between laboratory-scale and industrial-scale fractionating columns, but the principles are the same. Examples of laboratory-scale fractionating columns (in increasing efficiency) include\n* [[Condenser (laboratory)#Air condenser|Air condenser]]\n* [[Vigreux column]] (usually laboratory scale only)\n* [[Packed bed|Packed column]] (packed with glass beads, metal pieces, or other chemically inert material)\n* [[Spinning band distillation]] system.\n\n==Laboratory scale distillation==\nLaboratory scale distillations are almost exclusively run as batch distillations. The device used in distillation, sometimes referred to as a ''[[still]]'', consists at a minimum of a '''reboiler''' or ''pot'' in which the source material is heated, a '''condenser''' in which the heated [[gas|vapor]] is cooled back to the liquid [[phase (matter)|state]], and a '''receiver''' in which the concentrated or purified liquid, called the '''distillate''', is collected. Several laboratory scale techniques for distillation exist (see also [[:Category:Distillation|distillation types]]).\n\nA completely sealed distillation apparatus could experience extreme and rapidly varying internal pressure, which could cause it to burst open at the joints.  Therefore, some path is usually left open (for instance, at the receiving flask) to allow the internal pressure to equalize with atmospheric pressure. Alternatively, a [[vacuum pump]] may be used to keep the apparatus at a lower than atmospheric pressure.  If the substances involved are air- or moisture-sensitive, the connection to the atmosphere can be made through one or more [[drying tube]]s packed with materials that scavenge the undesired air components, or through [[bubbler]]s that provide a movable liquid barrier.  Finally, the entry of undesired air components can be prevented by pumping a low but steady flow of suitable inert gas, like [[nitrogen]], into the apparatus.\n\n===Simple distillation===\n[[File:Simple distillation apparatus.svg|300 px|thumb|right|Schematic of a simple distillation setup.]]\nIn '''simple distillation''', the vapor is immediately channeled into a condenser. Consequently, the distillate is not pure but rather its composition is identical to the composition of the vapors at the given temperature and pressure. That concentration follows [[Raoult's law]].\n\nAs a result, simple distillation is effective only when the liquid boiling points differ greatly (rule of thumb is 25&nbsp;\u00b0C)<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080908000656/http://www.iupac.org/didac/Didac%20Eng/Didac05/Content/ST07.htm ST07 Separation of liquid\u2013liquid mixtures (solutions)], DIDAC by [[IUPAC]]</ref> or when separating liquids from non-volatile solids or oils. For these cases, the vapor pressures of the components are usually different enough that the distillate may be sufficiently pure for its intended purpose.\n\nA cutaway schematic of a simple distillation operation is shown at left. The starting liquid '''15''' in the boiling flask '''2''' is heated by a combined [[hotplate]] and [[magnetic stirrer]] '''13''' via a [[silicone oil]] bath (orange, '''14'''). The vapor flows through a short [[Vigreux column]] '''3''', then through a [[Liebig condenser]] '''5''', is cooled by water (blue) that circulates through ports '''6''' and '''7'''. The condensed liquid drips into the receiving flask '''8''', sitting in a cooling bath (blue, '''16'''). The adapter '''10''' has a connection '''9''' that may be fitted to a vacuum pump. The components are connected by [[ground glass joint]]s (gray).\n\n===Fractional distillation===\n{{Main|Fractional distillation}}\n[[File:Double Distilled Water Unit.jpg|right|thumb|450px|Typical laboratory fractional distillation unit]]\nFor many cases, the boiling points of the components in the mixture will be sufficiently close that [[Raoult's law]] must be taken into consideration. Therefore, '''fractional distillation''' must be used in order to separate the components by repeated vaporization-condensation cycles within a packed fractionating column. This separation, by successive distillations, is also referred to as '''rectification'''.<ref name=Perry/>\n\nAs the solution to be purified is heated, its vapors rise to the [[fractionating column]]. As it rises, it cools, condensing on the condenser walls and the surfaces of the packing material. Here, the condensate continues to be heated by the rising hot vapors; it vaporizes once more. However, the composition of the fresh vapors are determined once again by Raoult's law. Each vaporization-condensation cycle (called a ''[[theoretical plate]]'') will yield a purer solution of the more volatile component.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070903202418/http://wulfenite.fandm.edu/labtech/fractdistill.htm Fractional Distillation]. fandm.edu</ref> In reality, each cycle at a given temperature does not occur at exactly the same position in the fractionating column; ''theoretical plate'' is thus a concept rather than an accurate description.\n\nMore theoretical plates lead to better separations. A [[spinning band distillation]] system uses a spinning band of [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]] or metal to force the rising vapors into close contact with the descending condensate, increasing the number of theoretical plates.<ref>[http://www.brinstrument.com/fractional-distillation/spinning_band_distillation.html Spinning Band Distillation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825161209/http://www.brinstrument.com/fractional-distillation/spinning_band_distillation.html |date=25 August 2006 }}. B/R Instrument Corporation (accessed 8 September 2006)</ref>\n\n===Steam distillation===\n{{Main|Steam distillation}}\nLike [[vacuum distillation]], '''steam distillation''' is a method for distilling compounds which are heat-sensitive.<ref>{{harvnb|Harwood|Moody|1989|pp=151\u2013153}}</ref> The temperature of the steam is easier to control than the surface of a [[heating element]], and allows a high rate of heat transfer without heating at a very high temperature. This process involves bubbling steam through a heated mixture of the raw material. By Raoult's law, some of the target compound will vaporize (in accordance with its partial pressure). The vapor mixture is cooled and condensed, usually yielding a layer of oil and a layer of water.\n\nSteam distillation of various [[aroma|aromatic]] herbs and flowers can result in two products; an [[essential oil]] as well as a watery [[herbal distillate]]. The [[essential oils]] are often used in perfumery and [[aromatherapy]] while the watery distillates have many applications in [[aromatherapy]], [[food processing]] and [[skin care]].\n\n[[File:Vacuum distillation of DMSO at 70C.jpg|left|thumb|[[Dimethyl sulfoxide]] usually boils at 189 \u00b0C. Under a vacuum, it distills off into the receiver at only 70 \u00b0C.]]\n[[File:perkin triangle distillation apparatus.svg|thumb|'''Perkin triangle distillation setup'''<br /> '''1:''' Stirrer bar/anti-bumping granules '''2:''' Still pot '''3:''' Fractionating column '''4:''' Thermometer/Boiling point temperature '''5:''' Teflon tap 1 '''6:''' Cold finger '''7:''' Cooling water out '''8:''' Cooling water in '''9:''' Teflon tap 2 '''10:''' Vacuum/gas inlet '''11:''' Teflon tap 3 '''12:''' Still receiver]]\n\n===Vacuum distillation===\n{{Main|Vacuum distillation}}\nSome compounds have very high boiling points. To boil such compounds, it is often better to lower the pressure at which such compounds are boiled instead of increasing the temperature. Once the pressure is lowered to the vapor pressure of the compound (at the given temperature), boiling and the rest of the distillation process can commence. This technique is referred to as '''vacuum distillation''' and it is commonly found in the laboratory in the form of the [[rotary evaporator]].\n\nThis technique is also very useful for compounds which boil beyond their [[decomposition temperature]] at atmospheric pressure and which would therefore be decomposed by any attempt to boil them under atmospheric pressure.\n\n[[Molecular distillation]] is vacuum distillation below the pressure of 0.01 [[torr]]. 0.01 torr is one order of magnitude above [[Hard vacuum|high vacuum]], where fluids are in the [[free molecular flow]] regime, i.e. the [[mean free path]] of molecules is comparable to the size of the equipment. The gaseous phase no longer exerts significant pressure on the substance to be evaporated, and consequently, rate of evaporation no longer depends on pressure. That is, because the continuum assumptions of fluid dynamics no longer apply, mass transport is governed by molecular dynamics rather than fluid dynamics. Thus, a short path between the hot surface and the cold surface is necessary, typically by suspending a hot plate covered with a film of feed next to a cold plate with a line of sight in between. Molecular distillation is used industrially for purification of oils.\n\n===Air-sensitive vacuum distillation===\nSome compounds have high boiling points as well as being [[air sensitive]]. A simple vacuum distillation system as exemplified above can be used, whereby the vacuum is replaced with an inert gas after the distillation is complete. However, this is a less satisfactory system if one desires to collect fractions under a reduced pressure. To do this a \"cow\" or \"pig\" adaptor can be added to the end of the condenser, or for better results or for very air sensitive compounds a [[Perkin triangle]] apparatus can be used.\n\nThe Perkin triangle, has means via a series of glass or [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]] taps to allows fractions to be isolated from the rest of the [[still]], without the main body of the distillation being removed from either the vacuum or heat source, and thus can remain in a state of [[reflux]]. To do this, the sample is first isolated from the vacuum by means of the taps, the vacuum over the sample is then replaced with an inert gas (such as [[nitrogen]] or [[argon]]) and can then be stoppered and removed. A fresh collection vessel can then be added to the system, evacuated and linked back into the distillation system via the taps to collect a second fraction, and so on, until all fractions have been collected.\n\n===Short path distillation===\n[[File:short path distillation apparatus.svg|thumb|right|Short path vacuum distillation apparatus with vertical condenser (cold finger), to minimize the distillation path; '''1: '''Still pot with stirrer bar/anti-bumping granules '''2:''' Cold finger \u2013 bent to direct condensate '''3: '''Cooling water out '''4:''' cooling water in '''5: '''Vacuum/gas inlet '''6:''' Distillate flask/distillate.]]\n[[Short path distillation]] is a distillation technique that involves the distillate travelling a short distance, often only a few centimeters, and is normally done at reduced pressure.<ref>{{harvnb|Harwood|Moody|1989|p=150}}</ref> A classic example would be a distillation involving the distillate travelling from one glass bulb to another, without the need for a condenser separating the two chambers. This technique is often used for compounds which are unstable at high temperatures or to purify small amounts of compound. The advantage is that the heating temperature can be considerably lower (at reduced pressure) than the boiling point of the liquid at standard pressure, and the distillate only has to travel a short distance before condensing. A short path ensures that little compound is lost on the sides of the apparatus. The [[Kugelrohr]] is a kind of a short path distillation apparatus which often contain multiple chambers to collect distillate fractions.\n\n===Zone distillation===\nZone distillation is a distillation process in long container with partial melting of refined matter in moving liquid zone and condensation of vapor in the solid phase at condensate pulling in cold area. The process is worked in theory. When zone heater is moving from the top to the bottom of the container then solid condensate with irregular impurity distribution is forming. Then most pure part of the condensate may be extracted as product. The process may be iterated many times by moving (without turnover) the received condensate to the bottom part of the container on the place of refined matter. The irregular impurity distribution in the condensate (that is efficiency of purification) increases with the number of iterations.\nZone distillation is the distillation analog of zone recrystallization. Impurity distribution in the condensate is described by known equations of zone recrystallization  \u2013 with the replacement of the distribution co-efficient k of crystallization - for the separation factor \u03b1 of distillation.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kravchenko |first=A.

In this process, the product is usually significantly lower-boiling than its reactants. As the product is formed from the reactants, it is vaporized and removed from the reaction mixture. This technique is an example of a continuous vs. a batch process; advantages include less downtime to charge the reaction vessel with starting material, and less workup. Distillation \"over a reactant\" could be classified as a reactive distillation. It is typically used to remove volatile impurity from the distallation feed. For example, a little [[lime (material)|lime]] may be added to remove carbon dioxide from water followed by a second distillation with a little [[sulfuric acid]] added to remove traces of ammonia.\n* [[Catalytic distillation]] is the process by which the reactants are catalyzed while being distilled to continuously separate the products from the reactants. This method is used to assist equilibrium reactions reach completion.\n* [[Pervaporation]] is a method for the separation of mixtures of liquids by partial vaporization through a non-porous [[Artificial membrane|membrane]].\n* [[Extractive distillation]] is defined as distillation in the presence of a miscible, high boiling, relatively non-volatile component, the solvent, that forms no [[azeotrope]] with the other components in the mixture.\n* [[Flash evaporation]] (or partial evaporation) is the partial [[vaporization]] that occurs when a saturated liquid stream undergoes a reduction in pressure by passing through a throttling [[valve]] or other throttling device. This process is one of the simplest unit operations, being equivalent to a distillation with only one equilibrium stage.\n* Codistillation is distillation which is performed on mixtures in which the two compounds are not miscible. In the laboratory, the [[Dean-Stark apparatus]] is used for this purpose to remove water from synthesis products. The Bleidner is another example with two refluxing solvents.\n* Membrane distillation is a type of distillation in which vapors of a mixture to be separated are passed through a membrane, which selectively permeates one component of mixture. Vapor pressure difference is the driving force. It has potential applications in seawater desalination and in removal of organic and inorganic components.\n\nThe unit process of [[evaporation]] may also be called \"distillation\":\n* In [[rotary evaporation]] a vacuum distillation apparatus is used to remove bulk [[solvent]]s from a sample. Typically the vacuum is generated by a [[aspirator (pump)|water aspirator]] or a [[membrane pump]].\n* In a [[kugelrohr]] a short path distillation apparatus is typically used (generally in combination with a (high) vacuum) to distill high boiling (> 300&nbsp;\u00b0C) compounds. The apparatus consists of an oven in which the compound to be distilled is placed, a receiving portion which is outside of the oven, and a means of rotating the sample. The vacuum is normally generated by using a high vacuum pump.\n\nOther uses:\n* [[Dry distillation]] or [[destructive distillation]], despite the name, is not truly distillation, but rather a [[chemical reaction]] known as [[pyrolysis]] in which solid substances are heated in an inert or [[redox|reducing]] atmosphere and any volatile fractions, containing high-boiling liquids and products of pyrolysis, are collected. The destructive distillation of [[wood]] to give [[methanol]] is the root of its common name \u2013 ''wood alcohol''.\n* [[Freeze distillation]] is an analogous method of purification using [[freezing]] instead of evaporation. It is not truly distillation, but a [[Recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallization]] where the product is the [[mother liquor]], and does not produce products equivalent to distillation. This process is used in the production of [[American-style lager#Ice beer|ice beer]] and [[ice wine]] to increase ethanol and [[sugar]] content, respectively. It is also used to produce [[Applejack (beverage)|applejack]]. Unlike distillation, freeze distillation concentrates poisonous congeners rather than removing them; As a result, many countries prohibit such applejack as a health measure. Also, distillation by evaporation can separate these since they have different boiling points.\n\n==Azeotropic distillation==\n{{Main|Azeotropic distillation}}\nInteractions between the components of the solution create properties unique to the solution, as most processes entail nonideal mixtures, where [[Raoult's law]] does not hold. Such interactions can result in a constant-boiling '''[[azeotrope]]''' which behaves as if it were a pure compound (i.e., boils at a single temperature instead of a range). At an azeotrope, the solution contains the given component in the same proportion as the vapor, so that evaporation does not change the purity, and distillation does not effect separation. For example, [[Ethanol|ethyl alcohol]] and [[Water (molecule)|water]] form an azeotrope of 95.6% at 78.1&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nIf the azeotrope is not considered sufficiently pure for use, there exist some techniques to break the azeotrope to give a pure distillate. This set of techniques are known as '''azeotropic distillation'''. Some techniques achieve this by \"jumping\" over the azeotropic composition (by adding another component to create a new azeotrope, or by varying the pressure). Others work by chemically or physically removing or sequestering the impurity. For example, to purify ethanol beyond 95%, a drying agent (or [[desiccant]], such as [[potassium carbonate]]) can be added to convert the soluble water into insoluble [[water of crystallization]]. [[Molecular sieve]]s are often used for this purpose as well.\n\nImmiscible liquids, such as water and [[toluene]], easily form azeotropes. Commonly, these azeotropes are referred to as a low boiling azeotrope because the boiling point of the azeotrope is lower than the boiling point of either pure component. The temperature and composition of the azeotrope is easily predicted from the vapor pressure of the pure components, without use of Raoult's law. The azeotrope is easily broken in a distillation set-up by using a liquid\u2013liquid separator (a decanter) to separate the two liquid layers that are condensed overhead. Only one of the two liquid layers is refluxed to the distillation set-up.\n\nHigh boiling azeotropes, such as a 20 weight percent mixture of hydrochloric acid in water, also exist. As implied by the name, the boiling point of the azeotrope is greater than the boiling point of either pure component.\n\nTo break azeotropic distillations and cross distillation boundaries, such as in the DeRosier Problem, it is necessary to increase the composition of the light key in the distillate.\n\n===Breaking an azeotrope with unidirectional pressure manipulation===\nThe boiling points of components in an azeotrope overlap to form a band. By exposing an azeotrope to a vacuum or positive pressure, it's possible to bias the boiling point of one component away from the other by exploiting the differing vapor pressure curves of each; the curves may overlap at the azeotropic point, but are unlikely to be remain identical further along the pressure axis either side of the azeotropic point. When the bias is great enough, the two boiling points no longer overlap and so the azeotropic band disappears.\n\nThis method can remove the need to add other chemicals to a distillation, but it has two potential drawbacks.\n\nUnder negative pressure, power for a vacuum source is needed and the reduced boiling points of the distillates requires that the condenser be run cooler to prevent distillate vapors being lost to the vacuum source. Increased cooling demands will often require additional energy and possibly new equipment or a change of coolant.\n\nAlternatively, if positive pressures are required, standard glassware can not be used, energy must be used for pressurization and there is a higher chance of side reactions occurring in the distillation, such as decomposition, due to the higher temperatures required to effect boiling.\n\nA unidirectional distillation will rely on a pressure change in one direction, either positive or negative.\n\n===Pressure-swing distillation===\n{{further|Azeotrope#Pressure swing distillation}}\n\nPressure-swing distillation is essentially the same as the unidirectional distillation used to break azeotropic mixtures, but here both [[Azeotrope#Pressure swing distillation|positive and negative pressures may be employed]].\n\nThis improves the selectivity of the distillation and allows a chemist to optimize distillation by avoiding extremes of pressure and temperature that waste energy. This is particularly important in commercial applications.\n\nOne example of the application of pressure-swing distillation is during the industrial purification of [[ethyl acetate]] after its catalytic synthesis from [[ethanol]].\n\n==Industrial distillation==\n[[File:Colonne distillazione.jpg|right|thumb|Typical industrial distillation towers]]\n{{Main|Continuous distillation}}\nLarge scale '''industrial distillation''' applications include both batch and continuous fractional, vacuum, azeotropic, extractive, and steam distillation. The most widely used industrial applications of continuous, steady-state fractional distillation are in [[oil refinery|petroleum refineries]], [[petrochemical]] and [[chemical plant]]s and [[natural gas processing]] plants.\n\nTo control and optimize such industrial distillation, a standardized laboratory method, ASTM D86, is established. This test method extends to the atmospheric distillation of petroleum products using a laboratory batch distillation unit to quantitatively determine the boiling range characteristics of petroleum products.\n\nIndustrial distillation<ref name=Perry>{{cite book|author1=Perry, Robert H.  |author2=Green, Don W.|title=Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook|edition=6th| publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1984|isbn=978-0-07-049479-4|title-link=Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook}}</ref><ref name=Kister>{{cite book|author=Kister, Henry Z.|title=Distillation Design|edition=1st |publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1992|isbn=978-0-07-034909-4|title-link=Distillation Design}}</ref> is typically performed in large, vertical cylindrical columns known as '''distillation towers''' or '''distillation columns''' with diameters ranging from about 65&nbsp;centimeters to 16&nbsp;meters and heights ranging from about 6&nbsp;meters to 90&nbsp;meters or more. When the process feed has a diverse composition, as in distilling [[crude oil]], liquid outlets at intervals up the column allow for the withdrawal of different ''fractions'' or products having different [[boiling points]] or boiling ranges. The \"lightest\" products (those with the lowest boiling point) exit from the top of the columns and the \"heaviest\" products (those with the highest boiling point) exit from the bottom of the column and are often called the '''bottoms'''.\n\n[[File:Continuous Binary Fractional Distillation.PNG|left|thumb|Diagram of a typical industrial distillation tower]]\nIndustrial towers use [[reflux]] to achieve a more complete separation of products. Reflux refers to the portion of the condensed overhead liquid product from a distillation or fractionation tower that is returned to the upper part of the tower as shown in the schematic diagram of a typical, large-scale industrial distillation tower. Inside the tower, the downflowing reflux liquid provides cooling and condensation of the upflowing vapors thereby increasing the efficiency of the distillation tower. The more reflux that is provided for a given number of [[theoretical plate]]s, the better the tower's separation of lower boiling materials from higher boiling materials. Alternatively, the more reflux that is provided for a given desired separation, the fewer the number of theoretical plates required. [[Chemical engineer]]s must choose what combination of reflux rate and number of plates is both economically and physically feasible for the products purified in the distillation column.\n\nSuch industrial fractionating towers are also used in [[cryogenic]] [[air separation]], producing [[liquid oxygen]], [[liquid nitrogen]], and high purity [[argon]]. Distillation of [[chlorosilane]]s also enables the production of high-purity [[silicon]] for use as a [[semiconductor]].\n\n[[File:Bubble Cap Trays.PNG|frame|right|Section of an industrial distillation tower showing detail of trays with bubble caps]]\nDesign and operation of a distillation tower depends on the feed and desired products. Given a simple, binary component feed, analytical methods such as the [[McCabe\u2013Thiele method]]<ref name=Perry/><ref name=SeaderHenley>{{cite book|author1=Seader, J. D.  |author2=Henley, Ernest J.|title=Separation Process Principles|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|year=1998|isbn=978-0-471-58626-5}}</ref> or the [[Fenske equation]]<ref name=Perry/> can be used. For a multi-component feed, [[simulation]] models are used both for design and operation. Moreover, the efficiencies of the vapor\u2013liquid contact devices (referred to as \"plates\" or \"trays\") used in distillation towers are typically lower than that of a theoretical 100% efficient [[equilibrium stage]]. Hence, a distillation tower needs more trays than the number of theoretical vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium stages. A variety of models have been postulated to estimate tray efficiencies.\n\nIn modern industrial uses, a packing material is used in the column instead of trays when low pressure drops across the column are required. Other factors that favor packing are: vacuum systems, smaller diameter columns, corrosive systems, systems prone to foaming, systems requiring low liquid holdup, and batch distillation. Conversely, factors that favor [[plate column]]s are: presence of solids in feed, high liquid rates, large column diameters, complex columns, columns with wide feed composition variation, columns with a chemical reaction, absorption columns, columns limited by foundation weight tolerance, low liquid rate, large turn-down ratio and those processes subject to process surges.\n[[File:Vacuum Column.jpg|thumb|left|183px|Large-scale, industrial vacuum distillation column<ref>[http://resources.schoolscience.co.uk/SPE/knowl/4/2index.htm?vacuum.html Energy Institute website page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012072758/http://resources.schoolscience.co.uk/SPE/knowl/4/2index.htm?vacuum.html |date=12 October 2007 }}.

Retrieved on 2014-04-20.</ref>]]\nThis packing material can either be random dumped packing (1\u20133\" wide) such as [[Raschig ring]]s or [[structured packing|structured sheet metal]]. Liquids tend to wet the surface of the packing and the vapors pass across this wetted surface, where [[mass transfer]] takes place. Unlike conventional tray distillation in which every tray represents a separate point of vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium, the vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium curve in a packed column is continuous. However, when modeling packed columns, it is useful to compute a number of \"theoretical stages\" to denote the separation efficiency of the packed column with respect to more traditional trays. Differently shaped packings have different surface areas and void space between packings. Both of these factors affect packing performance.\n\nAnother factor in addition to the packing shape and surface area that affects the performance of random or structured packing is the liquid and vapor distribution entering the packed bed. The number of [[Theoretical plate|theoretical stages]] required to make a given separation is calculated using a specific vapor to liquid ratio. If the liquid and vapor are not evenly distributed across the superficial tower area as it enters the packed bed, the liquid to vapor ratio will not be correct in the packed bed and the required separation will not be achieved. The packing will appear to not be working properly. The [[Theoretical plate|height equivalent to a theoretical plate]] (HETP) will be greater than expected. The problem is not the packing itself but the mal-distribution of the fluids entering the packed bed. Liquid mal-distribution is more frequently the problem than vapor. The design of the liquid distributors used to introduce the feed and reflux to a packed bed is critical to making the packing perform to it maximum efficiency. Methods of evaluating the effectiveness of a liquid distributor to evenly distribute the liquid entering a packed bed can be found in references.<ref name=Moore>Moore, F., Rukovena, F.

The number of effects is inversely proportional to the kW\u00b7h/m<sup>3</sup> of water recovered figure, and refers to the volume of water recovered per unit of energy compared with single-effect distillation. One effect is roughly 636&nbsp;kW\u00b7h/m<sup>3</sup>.\n* [[Multi-stage flash distillation]] can achieve more than 20 effects with thermal energy input, as mentioned in the article.\n* [[Vapor compression evaporation]] \u2013 Commercial large-scale units can achieve around 72 effects with electrical energy input, according to manufacturers.\n\nThere are many other types of multi-effect distillation processes, including one referred to as simply multi-effect distillation (MED), in which multiple chambers, with intervening heat exchangers, are employed.\n\n==Distillation in food processing==\n\n===Distilled beverages===\n{{Main|Distilled beverage}}\n\n[[Carbohydrate]]-containing plant materials are allowed to ferment, producing a dilute solution of ethanol in the process. Spirits such as [[whiskey]] and [[rum]] are prepared by distilling these dilute solutions of ethanol. Components other than ethanol, including water, esters, and other alcohols, are collected in the condensate, which account for the flavor of the beverage. Some of these beverages are then stored in barrels or other containers to acquire more flavor compounds and characteristic flavors.\n\n==Gallery==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|[[File:Retort-in-operation-early-chemistry.png|100px]]|| Chemistry in its beginnings used [[retort]]s as [[laboratory equipment]] exclusively for distillation processes.\n|-\n|[[File:Distillation of dry and oxygen-free toluene.jpg|100px]]|| A simple set-up to distill dry and oxygen-free [[toluene]].\n|-\n|[[File:Vacuum Column.png|100px]]||Diagram of an industrial-scale vacuum distillation column as commonly used in [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]]\n|-\n|[[File:Rotavapor.jpg|100px]]|| A [[rotary evaporator]] is able to distill solvents more quickly at lower temperatures through the use of a [[vacuum]].\n|-\n|[[File:Semi-microscale distillation.jpg|100px]]|| Distillation using semi-microscale apparatus.

It is still debated whether this plot actually planned to overthrow Elizabeth or even if Mary knew about it. Howard soon lost his nerve and the plan failed, but he made another effort to marry Mary in 1571 as part of the [[Ridolfi Plot]]. This plot planned to murder Elizabeth and free Mary. She would then marry Howard so that they could take the throne. Elizabeth's government discovered the plot and Howard's servants betrayed him under torture.

Norfolk was imprisoned by [[Elizabeth I|Queen Elizabeth]] and put on trial in January 1572. He was found guilty unanimously and beheaded on Tower Hill, London, in June.<ref>Hodder Education History for Edexcel: Early Elizabethan England</ref>\n\n==Depictions==\n*Thomas Howard appears as a character in the [[Philippa Gregory]] novels ''The Virgin's Lover'' and ''The Other Queen'', and in the novel ''I, Elizabeth'' by [[Rosalind Miles]].\n*A highly fictionalized version of the 4th Duke of Norfolk appears as a villain, played by [[Christopher Eccleston]], in the 1998 film ''[[Elizabeth (film)|Elizabeth]]''. \n*Another version of the Duke is in the BBC mini-series ''[[The Virgin Queen (TV serial)|The Virgin Queen]]'', played by [[Kevin McKidd]].\n*In the [[Channel 4]] [[documentary]] ''Elizabeth'' (2000) presented by [[David Starkey]], the Duke is portrayed by actor John Gully.\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|title=Ancestors of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk \n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.
