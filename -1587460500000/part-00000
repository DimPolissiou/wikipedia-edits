Jenny Humphrey, Dan's sister, is trying to fit in to the Upper East Side by following around Blair and her friends. Vanessa Abrams, Dan's best friend, returns. It is revealed that Dan had confessed his love for Vanessa in the past, but the two move beyond this as friends. It is discovered that Lily Van der Woodsen, Serena's mother, and Rufus Humphrey, Dan's father, have a romantic past and begin to rekindle their romance but decide to see other people in light of their children's romance. Blair and Nate eventually break up, after finally having sex. Nate discovers Blair's affair, causing a rift with Chuck. Throughout the season, Chuck tries to seduce Blair and the two somewhat come to terms with their feelings for each other. Georgina Sparks, past friend of Serena, returns, pretending to be a woman named Sarah from Portland. Georgina's return reminds Serena of the real reason she left the Upper East Side: she was involved in a drug-related death and felt responsible for the situation. Problems erupt between Dan and Serena, as Serena tries to hide her secret from him. However, the incident is resolved with Serena being absolved of her guilt, and Georgina leaves. Dan and Serena decide to end their relationship. Meanwhile, Lily accepts a marriage proposal from Bart Bass, despite her feelings for Rufus, and the season ends with a Bass wedding and Blair waiting for Chuck at the airport.\n\n===Season 2: 2008\u20132009===\n{{Main|Gossip Girl (season 2)}}\n<!-- Plot summary here should remain under 100 words per WP:TVPLOT. -->\n\nThe second season mainly explores the [[senior (education)|senior year]] of the characters with the premiere at [[the Hamptons]] and primarily focused on the relationship between Blair and Chuck, who were labeled \"the heart of ''GG''\" by ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite news |title=Leighton Meester biography |work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |date=November 25, 2008 |accessdate=September 27, 2009 |quote= |url=http://www.people.com/people/leighton_meester/biography}}</ref> At first, both characters deny their feelings for one another, and go through various schemes and manipulations.\n\nThe first half of the season deals with Serena's growing prominence as a socialite, which draws the attention of Blair as their friendship is tested when the character of [https://gossipgirl.fandom.com/wiki/Poppy_Lifton Poppy Lifton] ([[Tamara Feldman]]) arrives, a socialite who inadvertently drives a wedge between Serena and Blair after inspiring Serena to take her place in the spotlight during the early episodes of the season.

Drug and metabolite are mainly excreted via [[bile]] and [[feces]].\n\nPlasma concentrations of ticagrelor are slightly increased (12\u201323%) in elderly patients, women, patients of [[Asian ethnicity]], and patients with mild hepatic impairment. They are decreased in patients that described themselves as 'coloured' and those with severe renal impairment. These differences are considered clinically irrelevant.

Both ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX are bound to plasma proteins (>99.7%), and both are pharmacologically active. Blood plasma concentrations are linearly dependent on the dose up to 1260&nbsp;mg (the sevenfold daily dose). The metabolite reaches 30\u201340% of ticagrelor's plasma concentrations. Drug and metabolite are mainly excreted via [[bile]] and [[feces]].\n\nPlasma concentrations of ticagrelor are slightly increased (12\u201323%) in elderly patients, women, patients of [[Asian ethnicity]], and patients with mild hepatic impairment. They are decreased in patients that described themselves as 'coloured' and those with severe renal impairment. These differences are considered clinically irrelevant.
