It was tasked to evaluate German and Bolshevik links to the militant movement in India, especially in Punjab and Bengal.

[[Rail transport in India|Railway lines]] were cut, telegraph posts destroyed, government buildings burnt, and three Europeans murdered. By 13 April, the British government had decided to put most of Punjab under [[martial law]].

Reginald Dyer, the acting military commander for Amritsar and its environs, proceeded through the city with several city officials, announcing the implementation of a pass system to enter or leave Amritsar, a curfew beginning at 20:00 that night and a ban on all processions and public meetings of four or more persons. The proclamation was read and explained in English, Urdu, Hindi, and Punjabi, but few paid it any heed or appear to have learned of it later.<ref>Collett, ''The Butcher of Amritsar'' p. 252-253</ref> Meanwhile, local police had received intelligence of the planned meeting in the Jallianwala Bagh through word of mouth and plainclothes detectives in the crowds. At 12:40, Dyer was informed of the meeting and returned to his base at around 13:30 to decide how to handle it.<ref>Collett, ''The Butcher of Amritsar'' p. 253</ref>\n\nBy mid-afternoon, thousands of Indians had gathered in the [[Jallianwala Bagh]] (garden) near the [[Harmandir Sahib]] in Amritsar. Many who were present had earlier worshipped at the Golden Temple, and were passing through the Bagh on their way home. The Bagh was (and remains today) an open area of six to seven acres, roughly 200 yards by 200 yards in size, and surrounded on all sides by walls roughly 10 feet in height. Balconies of houses three to four stories tall overlooked the Bagh, and five narrow entrances opened onto it, several with lockable gates. During the rainy season, it was planted with crops, but served as a local meeting and recreation area for much of the year.<ref name=\"Collett, p. 254-255\">Collett, ''The Butcher of Amritsar'' p. 254-255</ref> In the center of the Bagh was a ''samadhi'' (cremation site) and a large well partly filled with water which measured about 20 feet in diameter.<ref name=\"Collett, p. 254-255\"/>\n\nApart from pilgrims, Amritsar had filled up over the preceding days with farmers, traders, and merchants attending the annual Baisakhi horse and cattle fair. The city police closed the fair at 14:00 that afternoon, resulting in a large number of people drifting into the Jallianwala Bagh.\n\nDyer arranged for an aeroplane to overfly the Bagh and estimate the size of the crowd, that he reported was about 6,000, while the [[Hunter Commission]] estimates a crowd of 10,000 to 20,000 had assembled by the time of Dyer's arrival.<ref name=\"Collett, p. 254-255\"/><ref name=\"Hunter\" /> Colonel Dyer and Deputy Commissioner Irving, the senior civil authority for Amritsar, took no actions to prevent the crowd assembling, or to peacefully disperse the crowds. This would later be a serious criticism levelled at both Dyer and Irving.\n \nAn hour after the meeting began as scheduled at 18:30, Colonel Dyer arrived at the Bagh with a group of ninety soldiers from the [[Gurkha| Gurkha Rifles]], the [[54th Sikhs (Frontier Force)|54th Sikhs]] and the [[59th Scinde Rifles (Frontier Force)|59th Sind Rifles]] .<ref name=\"archive.org\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/punjabdisturbanc01lahouoft|title=Punjab disturbances, April 1919; compiled from the Civil and military gazette|date=9 April 2018|publisher=Lahore Civil and Military Gazette Press|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> Fifty of them were armed with [[.303 British|.303]] [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] bolt-action rifles. It is not clear whether Dyer had specifically chosen troops from that ethnic group due to their proven loyalty to the British or that they were simply the Sikh and non-Sikh units most readily available. He had also brought two armoured cars armed with machine guns; however, the vehicles were left outside, as they were unable to enter the Bagh through the narrow entrances. The Jallianwala Bagh was surrounded on all sides by houses and buildings and had only five narrow entrances, most kept permanently locked. The main entrance was relatively wide, but was guarded heavily by the troops backed by the armoured vehicles.\n\nDyer, without warning the crowd to disperse, blocked the main exits. He stated later that this act \"was not to disperse the meeting but to punish the Indians for disobedience.\"<ref name=\"Collett, p 255-58\">Collett, ''The Butcher of Amritsar: General Reginald Dyer'' p 255-58</ref> Dyer ordered his troops to begin shooting toward the densest sections of the crowd in front of the available narrow exits, where panicked crowds were trying to leave the Bagh. Firing continued for approximately ten minutes. Cease-fire was ordered only when ammunition supplies were almost exhausted, after approximately 1,650 rounds were spent.<ref name=\"Colletp262\"/>\n\nApart from the many deaths directly from the shooting, a number of people died of crushing in the stampedes at the narrow gates or by jumping into the solitary well on the compound to escape the shooting. A plaque, placed at the site after independence, states that 120 bodies were removed from the well. The wounded could not be moved from where they had fallen, as a curfew was declared, and more who had been injured then died during the night.<ref>Collett, Nigel (2006).

The Government of Punjab, criticised by the [[Hunter Commission]] for not gathering accurate figures, only offered an approximate figure of 200. When interviewed by the members of the committee a senior civil servant in Punjab admitted that the actual figure could be higher.<ref name=\"Hunter\" /> The Sewa Samiti society independently carried out an investigation and reported 379 deaths, and 192 seriously wounded.

Referred to as the Disorders Inquiry Committee, it was later more widely known as the Hunter Commission. It was named after the chairman, [[William Hunter, Lord Hunter|William, Lord Hunter]], former Solicitor-General for Scotland and Senator of the College of Justice in Scotland. The stated purpose of the commission was to \"investigate the recent disturbances in [[Bombay]], [[Delhi]] and Punjab, about their causes, and the measures taken to cope with them\".<ref name=\"col333-334\">{{cite book|pages=333\u2013334|title=The Butcher of Amritsar: General Reginald Dyer|first=Nigel |last=Collett|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2006|isbn= 9781852855758|location=Amritsar (India)}}</ref> The members of the commission were:\n\n*Lord Hunter, Chairman of the Commission\n*Mr Justice George C.

Stokes, Secretary of the Commission and member of the Home Department<ref name=\"col333-334\"/>\n\nAfter meeting in New Delhi on 29 October, the Commission took statements from witnesses over the following weeks. Witnesses were called in Delhi, Ahmedabad, Bombay, and Lahore. Although the Commission as such was not a formally constituted court of law, meaning witnesses were not subject to questioning under oath, its members managed to elicit detailed accounts and statements from witnesses by rigorous cross-questioning. In general, it was felt the Commission had been very thorough in its enquiries.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/> After reaching Lahore in November, the Commission wound up its initial inquiries by examining the principal witnesses to the events in Amritsar.\n\nOn 19 November, Dyer was ordered to appear before the Commission. Although his military superiors had suggested he be represented by legal counsel at the inquiry, Dyer refused this suggestion and appeared alone.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/> Initially questioned by Lord Hunter, Dyer stated he had come to know about the meeting at the Jallianwala Bagh at 12:40 hours that day but did not attempt to prevent it. He stated that he had gone to the Bagh with the deliberate intention of opening fire if he found a crowd assembled there. Patterson says Dyer explained his sense of honour to the Hunter Commission by saying, \"I think it quite possible that I could have dispersed the crowd without firing, but they would have come back again and laughed, and I would have made, what I consider, a fool of myself.\"<ref>Steven Patterson, ''The cult of imperial honor in British India'' (2009) P. 67</ref> Dyer further reiterated his belief that the crowd in the Bagh was one of \"rebels who were trying to isolate my forces and cut me off from other supplies. Therefore, I considered it my duty to fire on them and to fire well\".<ref name=\"col333-334\"/>\n\nAfter Mr. Justice Rankin had questioned Dyer, Sir Chimanlal Setalvad enquired:\n\n{{quote|Sir Chimanlal: Supposing the passage was sufficient to allow the armoured cars to go in, would you have opened fire with the machine guns?\n\nDyer: I think probably, yes.\n\nSir Chimanlal: In that case, the casualties would have been much higher?\n\nDyer: Yes.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/>}}\n\nDyer further stated that his intentions had been to strike terror throughout Punjab and in doing so, reduce the moral stature of the \"rebels\". He said he did not stop the shooting when the crowd began to disperse because he thought it was his duty to keep shooting until the crowd dispersed, and that minimal shooting would not prove effective. In fact, he continued the shooting until the ammunition was almost exhausted.<ref>Nick Lloyd, ''The Amritsar Massacre: The Untold Story of One Fateful Day'' (2011) p. 157</ref> He stated that he did not make any effort to tend to the wounded after the shooting: \"Certainly not. It was not my job. Hospitals were open and they could have gone there.\"<ref>Collett, ''The Butcher of Amritsar'' p. 337</ref>\n\nExhausted from the rigorous cross-examination questioning and unwell, Dyer was then released. Over the next several months, while the Commission wrote its final report, the British press, as well as many MPs, turned increasingly hostile towards Dyer as the full extent of the massacre and his statements at the inquiry became widely known.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/> Lord Chelmsford refused to comment until the Commission had been wound up. In the meanwhile, Dyer became seriously ill with [[jaundice]] and [[arteriosclerosis]], and was hospitalised.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/>\n\nAlthough the members of the Commission had been divided by racial tensions following Dyer's statement, and though the Indian members had written a separate, minority report, the final report, comprising six volumes of evidence and released on 8 March 1920, unanimously condemned Dyer's actions.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/> In \"continuing firing as long as he did, it appears to us that General Dyer committed a grave error.\"<ref>Cyril Henry Philips, \"The evolution of India and Pakistan, 1858 to 1947: select documents\" p.214. Oxford University Press, 1962</ref> Dissenting members argued that the martial law regime's use of force was wholly unjustified. \"General Dyer thought he had crushed the rebellion and Sir [[Michael O'Dwyer]] was of the same view\", they wrote, \"(but) there was no rebellion which required to be crushed.\" The report concluded that:\n\n* Lack of notice to disperse from the Bagh, in the beginning, was an error.\n* The length of firing showed a grave error.\n* Dyer's motive of producing a sufficient moral effect was to be condemned.\n* Dyer had overstepped the bounds of his authority.\n* There had been no conspiracy to overthrow British rule in the Punjab.\n\nThe minority report of the Indian members further added that:\n\n* Proclamations banning public meetings were insufficiently distributed.\n* Innocent people were in the crowd, and there had been no violence in the Bagh beforehand.\n* Dyer should have either ordered his troops to help the wounded or instructed the civil authorities to do so.\n* Dyer's actions had been \"inhuman and un-British\" and had greatly injured the image of British rule in India.\n\nThe Hunter Commission did not impose any penal or disciplinary action because Dyer's actions were condoned by various superiors (later upheld by the Army Council).<ref name=\"churchillspeech\">{{cite web |date=8 July 1920 | title = Winston Churchill's speech in the House of Commons  | author1=Winston Churchill | url=http://lachlan.bluehaze.com.au/churchill/amritsar.htm |accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref> The Legal and Home Members on the Viceroy's Council ultimately decided that, though Dyer had acted in a callous and brutal way, military or legal prosecution would not be possible due to political reasons.

The common people and revolutionaries glorified the action of Udham Singh. Much of the press worldwide recalled the story of Jallianwala Bagh, and alleged O'Dwyer to have been responsible for the massacre. Singh was termed a \"fighter for freedom\" and his action was referred to in ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper as \"an expression of the pent-up fury of the down-trodden Indian People\".<ref>''The Times'', London, 16 March 1940</ref> Reporter and historian [[William L.

At that time, many, including [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and [[Mahatma Gandhi]], condemned the murder as senseless even if it was courageous. In 1952, Nehru (by then Prime Minister) honoured Udham Singh with the following statement, which appeared in the daily Partap:\n\n<blockquote>I salute Shaheed-i-Azam Udham Singh with reverence who had kissed the noose so that we may be free.</blockquote>\n\nSoon after this recognition by the Prime Minister, Udham Singh received the title of ''[[Martyrdom in Islam|Shaheed]]'', a name given to someone who has attained martyrdom or done something heroic on behalf of their country or religion.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n==Monument and legacy==\n[[File:Jallianwala Bagh Entrance.JPG|left|thumb|Entrance to the present-day [[Jallianwala Bagh]].]]\n[[File:Plaque Memorializing 1919 Amritsar Massacre - Jallianwala Bagh - Amritsar - Punjab - India (12675316515).jpg|left|thumb|Memorial plaque at [[Jallianwala Bagh]].]]\n[[File:Plaque in Passageway Memorializing 1919 Amritsar Massacre - Jallianwala Bagh - Amritsar - Punjab - India (12675337405).jpg|left|thumb|Memorial plaque in passageway of [[Jallianwala Bagh]] site.]]\n[[File:Bullet Holes in Wall from 1919 Amritsar Massacre - Jallianwala Bagh - Amritsar - Punjab - India (12675568575).jpg|left|thumb|Bullet holes in wall at [[Jallianwala Bagh]] memorial.]]\n[[File:Martyrs Well - Where Victims Leapt to Escape 1919 Amritsar Massacre - Jallianwala Bagh - Amritsar - Punjab - India (12675387185).jpg|left|thumb|Martyrs Well at the [[Jallianwala Bagh]] memorial.]]\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     =\n| image1    = Jallianwala Bagh Bullet Marked Wall.JPG\n| caption1  = Bullet marks, visible on preserved walls, at present-day Jallianwala Bagh\n| image2    = Jallianwala Bagh Bullet Marks.JPG\n| caption2  =\n}}\n\nA trust was founded in 1920 to build a memorial at the site after a resolution was passed by the Indian National Congress.

The pre-war [[Indian nationalist]] sentiment was revived as moderate and extremist groups of the [[Indian National Congress]] ended their differences to unify. In 1916, the Congress was successful in establishing the [[Lucknow Pact]], a temporary alliance with the [[All-India Muslim League]].

It was tasked to evaluate German and Bolshevik links to the militant movement in India, especially in Punjab and Bengal.

During the rainy season, it was planted with crops, but served as a local meeting and recreation area for much of the year.<ref name=\"Collett, p. 254-255\">Collett, ''The Butcher of Amritsar'' p. 254-255</ref> In the center of the Bagh was a ''samadhi'' (cremation site) and a large well partly filled with water which measured about 20 feet in diameter.<ref name=\"Collett, p. 254-255\"/>\n\nApart from pilgrims, Amritsar had filled up over the preceding days with farmers, traders, and merchants attending the annual Baisakhi horse and cattle fair. The city police closed the fair at 14:00 that afternoon, resulting in a large number of people drifting into the Jallianwala Bagh.\n\nDyer arranged for an aeroplane to overfly the Bagh and estimate the size of the crowd, that he reported was about 6,000, while the [[Hunter Commission]] estimates a crowd of 10,000 to 20,000 had assembled by the time of Dyer's arrival.<ref name=\"Collett, p. 254-255\"/><ref name=\"Hunter\" /> Colonel Dyer and Deputy Commissioner Irving, the senior civil authority for Amritsar, took no actions to prevent the crowd assembling, or to peacefully disperse the crowds. This would later be a serious criticism levelled at both Dyer and Irving.\n \nAn hour after the meeting began as scheduled at 18:30, Colonel Dyer arrived at the Bagh with a group of ninety soldiers from the [[Gurkha| Gurkha Rifles]], the [[54th Sikhs (Frontier Force)|54th Sikhs]] and the [[59th Scinde Rifles (Frontier Force)|59th Sind Rifles]] .<ref name=\"archive.org\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/punjabdisturbanc01lahouoft|title=Punjab disturbances, April 1919; compiled from the Civil and military gazette|date=9 April 2018|publisher=Lahore Civil and Military Gazette Press|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> Fifty of them were armed with [[.303 British|.303]] [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] bolt-action rifles. It is not clear whether Dyer had specifically chosen troops from that ethnic group due to their proven loyalty to the British or that they were simply the Sikh and non-Sikh units most readily available. He had also brought two armoured cars armed with machine guns; however, the vehicles were left outside, as they were unable to enter the Bagh through the narrow entrances. The Jallianwala Bagh was surrounded on all sides by houses and buildings and had only five narrow entrances, most kept permanently locked. The main entrance was relatively wide, but was guarded heavily by the troops backed by the armoured vehicles.\n\nDyer, without warning the crowd to disperse, blocked the main exits. He stated later that this act \"was not to disperse the meeting but to punish the Indians for disobedience.\"<ref name=\"Collett, p 255-58\">Collett, ''The Butcher of Amritsar: General Reginald Dyer'' p 255-58</ref> Dyer ordered his troops to begin shooting toward the densest sections of the crowd in front of the available narrow exits, where panicked crowds were trying to leave the Bagh. Firing continued for approximately ten minutes. Cease-fire was ordered only when ammunition supplies were almost exhausted, after approximately 1,650 rounds were spent.<ref name=\"Colletp262\"/>\n\nApart from the many deaths directly from the shooting, a number of people died of crushing in the stampedes at the narrow gates or by jumping into the solitary well on the compound to escape the shooting. A plaque, placed at the site after independence, states that 120 bodies were removed from the well. The wounded could not be moved from where they had fallen, as a curfew was declared, and more who had been injured then died during the night.<ref>Collett, Nigel (2006).

The Government of Punjab, criticised by the [[Hunter Commission]] for not gathering accurate figures, only offered an approximate figure of 200. When interviewed by the members of the committee a senior civil servant in Punjab admitted that the actual figure could be higher.<ref name=\"Hunter\" /> The Sewa Samiti society independently carried out an investigation and reported 379 deaths, and 192 seriously wounded.

Referred to as the Disorders Inquiry Committee, it was later more widely known as the Hunter Commission. It was named after the chairman, [[William Hunter, Lord Hunter|William, Lord Hunter]], former Solicitor-General for Scotland and Senator of the College of Justice in Scotland. The stated purpose of the commission was to \"investigate the recent disturbances in [[Bombay]], [[Delhi]] and Punjab, about their causes, and the measures taken to cope with them\".<ref name=\"col333-334\">{{cite book|pages=333\u2013334|title=The Butcher of Amritsar: General Reginald Dyer|first=Nigel |last=Collett|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2006|isbn= 9781852855758|location=Amritsar (India)}}</ref> The members of the commission were:\n\n*Lord Hunter, Chairman of the Commission\n*Mr Justice George C. Rankin of Calcutta\n*Sir [[Chimanlal Harilal Setalvad]], Vice-Chancellor of Bombay University and advocate of the Bombay High Court\n*W.F.

Stokes, Secretary of the Commission and member of the Home Department<ref name=\"col333-334\"/>\n\nAfter meeting in New Delhi on 29 October, the Commission took statements from witnesses over the following weeks. Witnesses were called in Delhi, Ahmedabad, Bombay, and Lahore. Although the Commission as such was not a formally constituted court of law, meaning witnesses were not subject to questioning under oath, its members managed to elicit detailed accounts and statements from witnesses by rigorous cross-questioning. In general, it was felt the Commission had been very thorough in its enquiries.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/> After reaching Lahore in November, the Commission wound up its initial inquiries by examining the principal witnesses to the events in Amritsar.\n\nOn 19 November, Dyer was ordered to appear before the Commission. Although his military superiors had suggested he be represented by legal counsel at the inquiry, Dyer refused this suggestion and appeared alone.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/> Initially questioned by Lord Hunter, Dyer stated he had come to know about the meeting at the Jallianwala Bagh at 12:40 hours that day but did not attempt to prevent it. He stated that he had gone to the Bagh with the deliberate intention of opening fire if he found a crowd assembled there. Patterson says Dyer explained his sense of honour to the Hunter Commission by saying, \"I think it quite possible that I could have dispersed the crowd without firing, but they would have come back again and laughed, and I would have made, what I consider, a fool of myself.\"<ref>Steven Patterson, ''The cult of imperial honor in British India'' (2009) P. 67</ref> Dyer further reiterated his belief that the crowd in the Bagh was one of \"rebels who were trying to isolate my forces and cut me off from other supplies. Therefore, I considered it my duty to fire on them and to fire well\".<ref name=\"col333-334\"/>\n\nAfter Mr. Justice Rankin had questioned Dyer, Sir Chimanlal Setalvad enquired:\n\n{{quote|Sir Chimanlal: Supposing the passage was sufficient to allow the armoured cars to go in, would you have opened fire with the machine guns?\n\nDyer: I think probably, yes.\n\nSir Chimanlal: In that case, the casualties would have been much higher?\n\nDyer: Yes.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/>}}\n\nDyer further stated that his intentions had been to strike terror throughout Punjab and in doing so, reduce the moral stature of the \"rebels\". He said he did not stop the shooting when the crowd began to disperse because he thought it was his duty to keep shooting until the crowd dispersed, and that minimal shooting would not prove effective. In fact, he continued the shooting until the ammunition was almost exhausted.<ref>Nick Lloyd, ''The Amritsar Massacre: The Untold Story of One Fateful Day'' (2011) p. 157</ref> He stated that he did not make any effort to tend to the wounded after the shooting: \"Certainly not. It was not my job. Hospitals were open and they could have gone there.\"<ref>Collett, ''The Butcher of Amritsar'' p. 337</ref>\n\nExhausted from the rigorous cross-examination questioning and unwell, Dyer was then released. Over the next several months, while the Commission wrote its final report, the British press, as well as many MPs, turned increasingly hostile towards Dyer as the full extent of the massacre and his statements at the inquiry became widely known.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/> Lord Chelmsford refused to comment until the Commission had been wound up. In the meanwhile, Dyer became seriously ill with [[jaundice]] and [[arteriosclerosis]], and was hospitalised.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/>\n\nAlthough the members of the Commission had been divided by racial tensions following Dyer's statement, and though the Indian members had written a separate, minority report, the final report, comprising six volumes of evidence and released on 8 March 1920, unanimously condemned Dyer's actions.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/> In \"continuing firing as long as he did, it appears to us that General Dyer committed a grave error.\"<ref>Cyril Henry Philips, \"The evolution of India and Pakistan, 1858 to 1947: select documents\" p.214. Oxford University Press, 1962</ref> Dissenting members argued that the martial law regime's use of force was wholly unjustified. \"General Dyer thought he had crushed the rebellion and Sir [[Michael O'Dwyer]] was of the same view\", they wrote, \"(but) there was no rebellion which required to be crushed.\" The report concluded that:\n\n* Lack of notice to disperse from the Bagh, in the beginning, was an error.\n* The length of firing showed a grave error.\n* Dyer's motive of producing a sufficient moral effect was to be condemned.\n* Dyer had overstepped the bounds of his authority.\n* There had been no conspiracy to overthrow British rule in the Punjab.\n\nThe minority report of the Indian members further added that:\n\n* Proclamations banning public meetings were insufficiently distributed.\n* Innocent people were in the crowd, and there had been no violence in the Bagh beforehand.\n* Dyer should have either ordered his troops to help the wounded or instructed the civil authorities to do so.\n* Dyer's actions had been \"inhuman and un-British\" and had greatly injured the image of British rule in India.\n\nThe Hunter Commission did not impose any penal or disciplinary action because Dyer's actions were condoned by various superiors (later upheld by the Army Council).<ref name=\"churchillspeech\">{{cite web |date=8 July 1920 | title = Winston Churchill's speech in the House of Commons  | author1=Winston Churchill | url=http://lachlan.bluehaze.com.au/churchill/amritsar.htm |accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref> The Legal and Home Members on the Viceroy's Council ultimately decided that, though Dyer had acted in a callous and brutal way, military or legal prosecution would not be possible due to political reasons. However, he was finally found guilty of a mistaken notion of duty and relieved of his command on 23 March. He had been recommended for a CBE as a result of his service in the Third Afghan War; this recommendation was cancelled on 29 March 1920.\n\n[[Reginald Dyer]] was disciplined by being removed from his appointment, was passed over for promotion and was prohibited from further employment in India.

Police and aircraft were used against the demonstrators, resulting in 12 deaths and 27 injuries. The Officer Commanding the [[Royal Air Force]] in India, [[Norman MacEwen|Brigadier General N D K MacEwen]] stated later that:\n\n<blockquote>I think we can fairly claim to have been of great use in the late riots, particularly at Gujranwala, where the crowd when looking at its nastiest was absolutely dispersed by a machine using bombs and Lewis guns.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafcms/mediafiles/BC18F893_1143_EC82_2E16AC19F19FE2D2.pdf |title=Royal Air Force Power Review |date=Spring 2008 |volume= |series=1 |accessdate=24 October 2010 |issue=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606163004/http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafcms/mediafiles/BC18F893_1143_EC82_2E16AC19F19FE2D2.pdf |archive-date=6 June 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Assassination of Michael O'Dwyer===\n{{See also|Udham Singh}}\n[[File:Sir-Michael-ODwyer.jpg|thumb|right| [[Michael O'Dwyer]] c. 1912]]\n\nOn 13 March 1940, at Caxton Hall in London, [[Udham Singh]], an Indian independence activist from Sunam who had witnessed the events in Amritsar and had himself been wounded, shot and killed [[Michael O'Dwyer]], the Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab at the time of the massacre, who had approved Dyer's action and was believed to have been the main planner.\n\nSome, such as the nationalist newspaper ''[[Amrita Bazar Patrika]]'', made statements supporting the killing. The common people and revolutionaries glorified the action of Udham Singh. Much of the press worldwide recalled the story of Jallianwala Bagh, and alleged O'Dwyer to have been responsible for the massacre. Singh was termed a \"fighter for freedom\" and his action was referred to in ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper as \"an expression of the pent-up fury of the down-trodden Indian People\".<ref>''The Times'', London, 16 March 1940</ref> Reporter and historian [[William L. Shirer]] wrote the next day, \"Most of the other Indians I know [other than Gandhi] will feel this is divine retribution.

Similar comment may be made on British rule in India. Will the historians of the future have to record that it was not the [[Nazism|Nazis]] but the British ruling class which destroyed the British Empire?\" Singh had told the court at his trial:\n[[File:Massacre memorial in Amritsar.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Wide view of [[Jallianwala Bagh]] memorial]]\n<blockquote>I did it because I had a grudge against him.

I am happy that I have done the job. I am not scared of death. I am dying for my country. I have seen my people starving in India under the British rule. I have protested against this, it was my duty. What greater honour could be bestowed on me than death for the sake of my motherland?<ref>CRIM 1/1177, Public Record Office, London, p 64</ref></blockquote>\n\nSingh was hanged for the murder on 31 July 1940. At that time, many, including [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and [[Mahatma Gandhi]], condemned the murder as senseless even if it was courageous. In 1952, Nehru (by then Prime Minister) honoured Udham Singh with the following statement, which appeared in the daily Partap:\n\n<blockquote>I salute Shaheed-i-Azam Udham Singh with reverence who had kissed the noose so that we may be free.</blockquote>\n\nSoon after this recognition by the Prime Minister, Udham Singh received the title of ''[[Martyrdom in Islam|Shaheed]]'', a name given to someone who has attained martyrdom or done something heroic on behalf of their country or religion.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n==Monument and legacy==\n[[File:Jallianwala Bagh Entrance.JPG|left|thumb|Entrance to the present-day [[Jallianwala Bagh]].]]\n[[File:Plaque Memorializing 1919 Amritsar Massacre - Jallianwala Bagh - Amritsar - Punjab - India (12675316515).jpg|left|thumb|Memorial plaque at [[Jallianwala Bagh]].]]\n[[File:Plaque in Passageway Memorializing 1919 Amritsar Massacre - Jallianwala Bagh - Amritsar - Punjab - India (12675337405).jpg|left|thumb|Memorial plaque in passageway of [[Jallianwala Bagh]] site.]]\n[[File:Bullet Holes in Wall from 1919 Amritsar Massacre - Jallianwala Bagh - Amritsar - Punjab - India (12675568575).jpg|left|thumb|Bullet holes in wall at [[Jallianwala Bagh]] memorial.]]\n[[File:Martyrs Well - Where Victims Leapt to Escape 1919 Amritsar Massacre - Jallianwala Bagh - Amritsar - Punjab - India (12675387185).jpg|left|thumb|Martyrs Well at the [[Jallianwala Bagh]] memorial.]]\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     =\n| image1    = Jallianwala Bagh Bullet Marked Wall.JPG\n| caption1  = Bullet marks, visible on preserved walls, at present-day Jallianwala Bagh\n| image2    = Jallianwala Bagh Bullet Marks.JPG\n| caption2  =\n}}\n\nA trust was founded in 1920 to build a memorial at the site after a resolution was passed by the Indian National Congress.

Also, General Dyer acted far beyond the principle of using reasonable and minimum force. Sir William Vincent stated that the actions of Dyer were of deep regret.

The committee ran campaigns through public meetings, newspaper publicity, and other means to enthuse people to join the Bengali Double Companies where important leaders, [[zamindar]]s, and social leaders also attended these meetings. The government very earnestly solicited their cooperation. The programme to recruit Bengalis for the Double Companies began on 30 August 1916 at the Fort Williams Cantonment in Calcutta.

At Tanuma the Bengalis performed the post-war rehabilitation duties. Some of the soldiers were engaged in [[Baghdad]] and elsewhere. After the [[Mesopotamia]]n war, there was a revolt in [[Kurdistan]] in April 1919. As many as 235 Bengalis were engaged in suppressing this rebellion.

And then the central office was established in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] (now [[Kolkata]]) and many branch offices were formed at all districts and at some major subdivisions. The committee ran campaigns through public meetings, newspaper publicity, and other means to enthuse people to join the Bengali Double Companies where important leaders, [[Zamindar|zamindars]], and social leaders also attended these meetings. The government very earnestly solicited their cooperation. The programme to recruit Bengalis for the Double Companies began on 30 August 1916 at the Fort Williams Cantonment in Calcutta. The first ten soldiers of the Bengali Double Company left Calcutta on September 12 for [[Naushera, Punjab|Naushera]] for training. Subsequently, more groups of recruits left for [[Naushera, Punjab|Naushera]]. There the 46th Punjab Regiment was in charge of their training.

Still, there was no significant improvement in their health in [[Kut|Al Kut]]. Then, towards the end of October, they were sent to [[Tanuma]] near [[Basra]]. While at [[Kut|Al Kut]], Tanuma and [[\u2018Aziziya|Azizia]], the Bengalis performed mainly security duties alongside receiving military training.\n\nBy November 1918 armistice was declared. At Tanuma the Bengalis performed the post-war rehabilitation duties. Some of the soldiers were engaged in [[Baghdad]] and elsewhere. After the [[Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian]] war, there was a revolt in [[Kurdistan]] in April 1919. As many as 235 Bengalis were engaged in suppressing this rebellion.

The soldiers of the Karachi Depot also used to stay here while in transit from leave or on some duty.

They depict a triumphal military parade celebrating the victory of [[Julius Caesar]] in the [[Gallic Wars]]. Acknowledged from the time of Mantegna as his greatest masterpiece, they remain the most complete pictorial representation of a [[Roman triumph]] ever attempted and together they form the world's largest metric area of Italian Renaissance paintings outside Italy. Acquired by [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1629, they now form part of the [[Royal Collection]] at [[Hampton Court Palace]] near London, where they occupy a special gallery, with a new continuous frame intended to capture their original setting, mounted into panelling.\n\nOriginally painted in the fragile medium of egg and glue [[tempera]] on canvas, the paintings underwent successive repaintings and restorations through the centuries, and are damaged in many areas.  Each canvas measures 2.66 \u00d7 2.78&nbsp;m. In total they cover an area more than 70 metres square.\n\n== Subject ==\nThe series depicts Caesar on a triumphal chariot returning from his successful campaigns, in a procession of Roman soldiers, standard-bearers, musicians and the spoils of war including an assortment of booty (including arms, intricate sculpture and gold vases), exotic animals and captives. These paintings celebrate two of [[Julius Caesar]]'s greatest campaigns \u2013 his victory over the [[Gauls]] and the recovery of [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]] in [[Asia Minor]]. Mantegna was inspired by written accounts of Caesar's celebratory processions through Rome as well as Roman antiquities in the Duke's collection.<ref>{{harvnb|Martindale|1979|p=17,125}}</ref>\n\n[[Giorgio Vasari]] described them as follows: \"We can see grouped and cleverly arranged in the Triumph the ornate and beautiful chariot, the figure of a man cursing the victorious hero, the victor's relations, the perfumes, incense and sacrifices, the priests, the bulls crowned for sacrifice, the prisoners, the booty captured by the troops, the rank of the squadrons, the elephants, the spoils, the victories and the cities represented in various chariots, along with a mass of trophies on spears, and with helmets and armour, headgear of all kinds, ornaments and countless pieces of plate.\" <ref>{{harvnb|Vasari|1965|pages=244\u2013245}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe ''Triumphs of Caesar'' were initially painted from 1484 to 1492<ref>Great Works, ''The Triumphs of Caesar (1484\u201392)'' Tom Lubbock,  ''The Independent'', 6 May 2005</ref> for the [[ducal Palace, Mantua|Ducal Palace]] in [[Mantua]], commissioned by either the Duke [[Federico I Gonzaga]] or, more likely, his son [[Francesco II Gonzaga|Francesco II]].\n[[File:Triunphus Caesaris plate 6 - Andreani.jpg|thumb|One of a set of coloured [[chiaroscuro woodcut]]s with added [[gouache]], among the finest in the technique, by [[Andrea Andreani]], 1598/99]]\n\nThe Gonzaga dynasty died out in the male line, and the major part of their painting collection was acquired by [[Charles I of England]] in 1629, using as an agent in Italy, the courtier [[Daniel Nys]]. The collection also included works by [[Titian]], [[Raphael]] and [[Caravaggio]]. The ''Triumphs'' arrived in 1630 at Hampton Court Palace, where they have remained ever since. The Lower [[Orangery]] was originally built to house [[Mary II of England]]'s larger tender plants. It was chosen as a setting for the series, since it re-creates the interior of the ''Palace of San Sebastiano'' in [[Mantua]], [[Italy]], where the paintings were hung from 1506 in a specially built gallery.  The paintings are displayed as a continuous [[frieze]], separated by small columns.\n\nAfter the execution of Charles I in 1649, the ''Triumphs'' were listed in an inventory and valued at 1,000 pounds ({{Inflation|UK|1000|1649|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3|r=-4}});{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} the entire Gonzaga acquisition cost 25,000 pounds ({{Inflation|UK|25000|1629|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3|r=-4}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} [[Oliver Cromwell]] refrained from selling these paintings, almost alone among Charles's collection, due to their fame, and perhaps as they celebrated a general like himself rather than a monarch or Catholic religious theme.\n\n==Reception and influence==\n[[File:Rubens-roman-triumph.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Rubens]], c 1630: ''A Roman Triumph'', [[National Gallery]], [[London]]]]\nThe ''Triumphs of Caesar'' were described as \"the best thing Mantegna ever painted\" by [[Giorgio Vasari]] in his celebrated ''[[Lives of the Artists]]''.\nThey rapidly became extremely famous throughout Europe, principally through copies in [[old master print|print]] form, of which many different versions were made, starting with a contemporary set from Mantegna's own workshop. Between 1517 and 1519, [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], using prints, painted a copy of the work on nine exterior panels of the Hertenstein House in [[Lucerne]], now demolished.<ref>{{harvnb|B\u00e4tschmann|Griener|1997|page=68}}</ref> [[Andrea Aspertini]] (1558\u20131629) made prints of the paintings in Mantua.\n\n==Early 20th century restoration==\nThe painter and critic [[Roger Fry]] undertook a restoration of ''The Picture Bearers'' starting in 1910. This was approved by [[Lionel Cust]], Keeper of the King's Pictures. Fry removed what [[Louis Laguerre]] had done a century before, and worked on and off for eleven years, with assistance from [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] and [[Dora Carrington]], to repaint parts of the canvas. The art historian [[Frances Spalding]] holds that Fry made many poor artistic and technical decisions, \"and, worst of all, they changed the Negro standard bearer into a Caucasian\". Fry did not attempt to restore any of the other paintings in the series, and said in 1925 that ''The Picture Bearers'' was \"one of [his] maddest follies\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Spalding|first1=Frances|title=Roger Fry : art and life|date=1980|publisher=Univ. of California press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520041264}}</ref>\n\n==1960s restoration==\nThe paintings had so deteriorated that visitors in the 19th century deplored their condition. In the 1960s a careful restoration to reveal the original paintwork was conducted on all but the seventh canvas, where no trace had been left by previous restorers. Although now mere shadows of Mantegna's [[cinquecento]] paintings, they still convey a powerful impression of epic grandeur.<ref>{{harvnb|Elam|2008|page=363}}</ref> In the words of [[Anthony Blunt]], who as [[Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures]] supervised the restoration, \"The ''Triumphs'' may be a ruin but it is a noble one, one as noble as those of ancient Rome which Mantegna so deeply admired.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Martindale|1978|page=10}}</ref>\n\nArt critic Tom Lubbock, writing about the restored paintings called the pictures \"the epitome of Renaissance art in the service of state power \u2013 they carry a powerful sense of inexorable procession \u2013 impressing the viewer with the inexhaustible quantity of available power and plunder.\"<ref>Great Works, ''The Triumphs of Caesar (1484\u201392)'' Tom Lubbock,  The Independent, 6 May 2005</ref>\n\nThe series is now displayed to the public under low level electric light for conservation reasons.\n\nCopies of the paintings were made in the early 17th century by [[Ludovico Dondi]].\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nTriumph2-Mantegna-bearers-of-standards.jpg|<center>''Bearers of Standards''</center>\nTriumph3-Mantegna-bearers-of-trophies-and-bullion.jpg|<center>''Bearers of Trophies and Bullion''</center>\nTriumph5-Mantegna-elephants.jpg|<center>''Elephants''</center>\nTriumph6-Mantegna-corselet-bearers.jpg|<center>''Corselet Bearers''</center>\nTriumph7-Mantegna-captives.jpg |<center>''Captives''</center>\nTriumph8-Mantegna-musicians.jpg|<center>''Musicians''</center>\nTriumph9-Mantegna-Julius-Caesar.jpg|<center>''Julius Caesar''</center>\nTrionfi di cesare 10.jpg|<center>''Senators'', early print version</center>\nCaesar\u2019s Triumph, by Peter Paul Rubens and Erasmus Quellinus II.jpg|Free copy by [[Rubens]] and [[Erasmus Quellinus II]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Literary sources==\n<small> This table is taken from Appendix III in {{harvtxt|Martindale|1979}}.

They depict a triumphal military parade celebrating the victory of [[Julius Caesar]] in the [[Gallic Wars]]. Acknowledged from the time of Mantegna as his greatest masterpiece, they remain the most complete pictorial representation of a [[Roman triumph]] ever attempted and together they form the world's largest metric area of Italian Renaissance paintings outside Italy. Acquired by [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1629, they now form part of the [[Royal Collection]] at [[Hampton Court Palace]] near London, where they occupy a special gallery, with a new continuous frame intended to capture their original setting, mounted into panelling.\n\nOriginally painted in the fragile medium of egg and glue [[tempera]] on canvas, the paintings underwent successive repaintings and restorations through the centuries, and are damaged in many areas.  Each canvas measures 2.66 x 2.78&nbsp;m. In total they cover an area more than 70 metres square.\n\n== Subject ==\nThe series depicts Caesar on a triumphal chariot returning from his successful campaigns, in a procession of Roman soldiers, standard-bearers, musicians and the spoils of war including an assortment of booty (including arms, intricate sculpture and gold vases), exotic animals and captives. These paintings celebrate two of [[Julius Caesar]]'s greatest campaigns \u2013 his victory over the [[Gauls]] and the recovery of [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]] in [[Asia Minor]]. Mantegna was inspired by written accounts of Caesar's celebratory processions through Rome as well as Roman antiquities in the Duke's collection.<ref>{{harvnb|Martindale|1979|p=17,125}}</ref>\n\n[[Giorgio Vasari]] described them as follows: \"We can see grouped and cleverly arranged in the Triumph the ornate and beautiful chariot, the figure of a man cursing the victorious hero, the victor's relations, the perfumes, incense and sacrifices, the priests, the bulls crowned for sacrifice, the prisoners, the booty captured by the troops, the rank of the squadrons, the elephants, the spoils, the victories and the cities represented in various chariots, along with a mass of trophies on spears, and with helmets and armour, headgear of all kinds, ornaments and countless pieces of plate.\" <ref>{{harvnb|Vasari|1965|pages=244\u2013245}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe ''Triumphs of Caesar'' were initially painted from 1484 to 1492<ref>Great Works, ''The Triumphs of Caesar (1484\u201392)'' Tom Lubbock,  ''The Independent'', 6 May 2005</ref> for the [[ducal Palace, Mantua|Ducal Palace]] in [[Mantua]], commissioned by either the Duke [[Federico I Gonzaga]] or, more likely, his son [[Francesco II Gonzaga|Francesco II]].\n[[File:Triunphus Caesaris plate 6 - Andreani.jpg|thumb|One of a set of coloured [[chiaroscuro woodcut]]s with added [[gouache]], among the finest in the technique, by [[Andrea Andreani]], 1598/99]]\n\nThe Gonzaga dynasty died out in the male line, and the major part of their painting collection was acquired by [[Charles I of England]] in 1629, using as an agent in Italy, the courtier [[Daniel Nys]]. The collection also included works by [[Titian]], [[Raphael]] and [[Caravaggio]]. The ''Triumphs'' arrived in 1630 at Hampton Court Palace, where they have remained ever since. The Lower [[Orangery]] was originally built to house [[Mary II of England]]'s larger tender plants. It was chosen as a setting for the series, since it re-creates the interior of the ''Palace of San Sebastiano'' in [[Mantua]], [[Italy]], where the paintings were hung from 1506 in a specially built gallery.  The paintings are displayed as a continuous [[frieze]], separated by small columns.\n\nAfter the execution of Charles I in 1649, the ''Triumphs'' were listed in an inventory and valued at 1,000 pounds ({{Inflation|UK|1000|1649|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3|r=-4}});{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} the entire Gonzaga acquisition cost 25,000 pounds ({{Inflation|UK|25000|1629|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3|r=-4}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} [[Oliver Cromwell]] refrained from selling these paintings, almost alone among Charles's collection, due to their fame, and perhaps as they celebrated a general like himself rather than a monarch or Catholic religious theme.\n\n==Reception and influence==\n[[File:Rubens-roman-triumph.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Rubens]], c 1630: ''A Roman Triumph'', [[National Gallery]], [[London]]]]\nThe ''Triumphs of Caesar'' were described as \"the best thing Mantegna ever painted\" by [[Giorgio Vasari]] in his celebrated ''[[Lives of the Artists]]''.\nThey rapidly became extremely famous throughout Europe, principally through copies in [[old master print|print]] form, of which many different versions were made, starting with a contemporary set from Mantegna's own workshop. Between 1517 and 1519, [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], using prints, painted a copy of the work on nine exterior panels of the Hertenstein House in [[Lucerne]], now demolished.<ref>{{harvnb|B\u00e4tschmann|Griener|1997|page=68}}</ref> [[Andrea Aspertini]] (1558\u20131629) made prints of the paintings in Mantua.\n\n==Early C20 restoration==\nThe painter and critic [[Roger Fry]] undertook a restoration of ''The Picture Bearers'' starting in 1910. This was approved by [[Lionel Cust]], Keeper of the King's Pictures. Fry removed what [[Louis Laguerre]] had done a century before, and worked on and off for eleven years, with assistance from [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] and [[Dora Carrington]], to repaint parts of the canvas. The art historian [[Frances Spalding]] holds that Fry made many poor artistic and technical decisions, \"and, worst of all, they changed the Negro standard bearer into a Caucasian\". Fry did not attempt to restore any of the other paintings in the series, and said in 1925 that ''The Picture Bearers'' was \"one of [his] maddest follies\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Spalding|first1=Frances|title=Roger Fry : art and life|date=1980|publisher=Univ. of California press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520041264}}</ref>\n\n==1960s restoration==\nThe paintings had so deteriorated that visitors in the 19th century deplored their condition. In the 1960s a careful restoration to reveal the original paintwork was conducted on all but the seventh canvas, where no trace had been left by previous restorers. Although now mere shadows of Mantegna's [[cinquecento]] paintings, they still convey a powerful impression of epic grandeur.<ref>{{harvnb|Elam|2008|page=363}}</ref> In the words of [[Anthony Blunt]], who as [[Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures]] supervised the restoration, \"The ''Triumphs'' may be a ruin but it is a noble one, one as noble as those of ancient Rome which Mantegna so deeply admired.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Martindale|1978|page=10}}</ref>\n\nArt critic Tom Lubbock, writing about the restored paintings called the pictures \"the epitome of Renaissance art in the service of state power \u2013 they carry a powerful sense of inexorable procession \u2013 impressing the viewer with the inexhaustible quantity of available power and plunder.\" <ref>Great Works, ''The Triumphs of Caesar (1484\u201392)'' Tom Lubbock,  The Independent, 6 May 2005</ref>\n\nThe series is now displayed to the public under low level electric light for conservation reasons.\n\nCopies of the paintings were made in the early 17th century by [[Ludovico Dondi]].\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nTriumph2-Mantegna-bearers-of-standards.jpg|<center>''Bearers of Standards''</center>\nTriumph3-Mantegna-bearers-of-trophies-and-bullion.jpg|<center>''Bearers of Trophies and Bullion''</center>\nTriumph5-Mantegna-elephants.jpg|<center>''Elephants''</center>\nTriumph6-Mantegna-corselet-bearers.jpg|<center>''Corselet Bearers''</center>\nTriumph7-Mantegna-captives.jpg |<center>''Captives''</center>\nTriumph8-Mantegna-musicians.jpg|<center>''Musicians''</center>\nTriumph9-Mantegna-Julius-Caesar.jpg|<center>''Julius Caesar''</center>\nTrionfi di cesare 10.jpg|<center>''Senators'', early print version</center>\nCaesar\u2019s Triumph, by Peter Paul Rubens and Erasmus Quellinus II.jpg|Free copy by [[Rubens]] and [[Erasmus Quellinus II]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Literary sources==\n<small> This table is taken from Appendix III in {{harvtxt|Martindale|1979}}.
