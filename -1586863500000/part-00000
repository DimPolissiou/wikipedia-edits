It aired on [[Comedy Central]] on September 2, 2010 as a mid-season finale, with remaining episodes broadcast in November 2010 and in 2011. In the episode, the Planet Express crew celebrate their 100th delivery. [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]]'s status as a mutant is exposed to the public and she is [[Deported#External deportation|deported]] from the surface and forced to live with other mutants in the sewers.  She recognizes the inequality with which mutants are forced to live and rallies them together in an equal rights revolt against the surface dwellers.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Eric Horsted]] and directed by Raymie Muzquiz.  [[Mark Mothersbaugh]] of the band [[Devo]] guest stars as himself, while the band appears as future mutated versions of themselves. Having the 100th episode as the sixth season finale was a coincidence.  The production team sought to focus the episode's subject matter on a topic with roots in the series' history.  They eventually chose to write about Leela's mutant heritage, which had been one of the series' longstanding storylines. \"The Mutants Are Revolting\" received generally positive reviews from critics.  Although recognized as an unlikely landmark for ''Futurama'' by critics due to its previous cancellation, the episode was criticized for failing to live up to its status as the series' 100th episode. Devo's guest appearance is one of co-producer and head writer [[David X. Cohen]]'s favorite moments in the series.\n\n==Plot==\nThe crew is hired for their 100th delivery and [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] plans the \"party of the millennium\". The wealthy widow [[Astor family|Astor]], invites [[Fry (Futurama)|Fry]] and [[Professor Farnsworth]] to a fundraiser for mutant education. [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]] notices that Astor and the socialites want to distract the mutants from their living conditions and [[social inequality]]. Fry accidentally reveals Leela as a mutant illegally living on the surface, and she is banished to the sewers. While attempting to appeal to Mayor Poopenmeyer on Leela's behalf, the crew is banished to the sewers for two weeks for harboring a mutant.\n\nIn the sewers, the crew finds the wreckage of the ''[[RMS Titanic|Land Titanic]]'', a luxury land bus that sunk into the street in 2912 after striking a mailbox on its maiden voyage, with Astor's husband among the ship's dead passengers. They find the original [[passenger name record|passenger manifest]] and a priceless quantum-force {{Not a typo|gemerald}} from Astor's husband to his wife. Fry attempts to reconcile with Leela, who rebuffs him. Determined to prove that he stands by Leela and mutants' plight, Fry jumps into the toxic sewage lake and emerges as a grotesque mutant blob. The crew is disgusted by Fry's new appearance, but Leela is touched by Fry's sacrifice and rallies the mutants and the crew to fight for equal rights. The mutants sabotage the sewer system by bending the main sewage pipe, which sends waste up to flood the surface.\n\nWhile the mutants demand desegregation and equal rights from Mayor Poopenmeyer, Astor tries to force them back underground using a wave of sewage held in [[Madison Square Garden|Madison Cube Garden]], but Fry uses the {{Not a typo|gemerald}}'s energy to part the wave and defend the mutants. He shows the mayor and Astor the ''Land Titanic'' passenger manifest, which includes Leela's maternal grandmother, who worked on the ''Land Titanic'' when it sunk. Leela's grandmother explains that Astor's husband gave up his reserved seat on the [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|life car]] for her and her mother. The widowed Astor is moved and urges Mayor Poopenmeyer to support mutant equality. As he and Leela kiss over their victory, Fry's grotesque form melts away, revealing itself to be Astor's mutated husband who fell into the toxic lake and survived as the ''Land Titanic'' sunk; Fry had unknowingly lodged himself in the mutant's mouth. The Astors happily reunite, and the Planet Express crew throw another party in celebration together with Leela's family, who are now allowed access to the surface.\n\n==Production==\nThe episode was written by [[Eric Horsted]] and directed by Raymie Muzquiz.  In an interview, series co-producer and head writer [[David X. Cohen]] stated that the 100th episode coinciding with the season finale was unplanned, with the staff only realizing it after receiving the broadcast schedule from Comedy Central.<ref name=\"iFMagInterview\">{{cite web|url=http://ifmagazine.com/feature.asp?article=3955 |title=Exclusive Interview: 'Futurama' Co-Creator David X.

The song \"Bend It\" by the British 1960s pop group [[Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich]] is used in this episode. The \"Westside Pipeway\" scene is reminiscent of a scene in the 1927 silent film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]''.<ref name=\"A.V.Club\" /> The program suggests that [[Brown University]] is now located in the mutant underground. They refer to it as an \"institution of lower learning. [http://theinfosphere.org/Transcript:The_Mutants_Are_Revolting] Leela also refers to the uprising of the mutants as the 'Million Mutant March' which references the '[[Million Man March]]'. The episode also contains self-references, such as the inclusion of many one-time and recurring characters in the background of Bender's party scene.<ref name=\"io9\" /> When Devo appear, they are asked to play \"[[Whip It (Devo song)|Whip It]]\", their most successful single. Refusing, they decide to play \"the other one\" and perform \"[[Beautiful World (Devo song)|Beautiful World]]\", one of only a few singles of theirs to find mainstream success. Near the end of the episode, Fry divides the wave of waste in two, preventing it from hitting the mutants and saying \"let my people stay\", which is the reference to the [[Crossing of the Red Sea]] and the \"[[Go Down Moses]]\" song. After this happens, one mutant says \"Are we not men!\" which is a reference to Devo's first album.\n\n==Broadcast and reception==\n\"The Mutants Are Revolting\" originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] on September 2, 2010.<ref name=\"Details\">{{cite web|url= http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/09/03/thursday-cable-ratings-jersey-shore-massive-american-chopper-up-futurama-down-more/62152|title=Thursday Cable Ratings: \u2018Jersey Shore\u2019 Massive, \u2018American Chopper\u2019 Up, \u2018Futurama\u2019 Down & More |last1 = Gorman | first1 = Bill |date=September 3, 2010 |work=TV By The Numbers |accessdate=2010-09-03 }}</ref>  In its original broadcast, \"The Mutants Are Revolting\" was viewed by an estimated population of 1.792 million with a 1.2 rating/2% share in [[Nielsen ratings]] and a 0.9 rating/2% share in the 18\u201349 demographic, going down two tenths of a point from the previous week's episode \"[[Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences]]\".<ref name=\"Details\" />\n\nThe episode was met with generally positive reviews from critics.  Alasdair Wilkins of [[io9]] gave the episode a positive review, calling it \"brilliant\" and writing, \"'The Mutants are Revolting' is another excellent addition, with Futurama's customary mix of jokes, emotions, and wild ideas.\"<ref name=\"io9\" />  Carlos Delgado of ''iF Magazine'' gave the episode a B, stating that it \"was good, but not on par with the best episodes of the season. It did, however, meet all the criteria of what makes a good ''Futurama'' episode. There was the goofy and fun premise involving the two primary characters of the show, Fry and Leela. More importantly, ''Futurama'' takes full advantage of the fact that it is animated and set far in the future. And, of course, there\u2019s the usual witty banter and quirky one-liners that permeate every corner of the show.

It aired on [[Comedy Central]] on September 2, 2010 as a mid-season finale, with remaining episodes broadcast in November 2010 and in 2011. In the episode, the Planet Express crew celebrate their 100th delivery. [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]]'s status as a mutant is exposed to the public and she is [[Deported#External deportation|deported]] from the surface and forced to live with other mutants in the sewers.  She recognizes the inequality with which mutants are forced to live and rallies them together in an equal rights revolt against the surface dwellers.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Eric Horsted]] and directed by Raymie Muzquiz.  [[Mark Mothersbaugh]] of the band [[Devo]] guest stars as himself, while the band appears as future mutated versions of themselves. Having the 100th episode as the sixth season finale was a coincidence.  The production team sought to focus the episode's subject matter on a topic with roots in the series' history.  They eventually chose to write about Leela's mutant heritage, which had been one of the series' longstanding storylines. \"The Mutants Are Revolting\" received generally positive reviews from critics.  Although recognized as an unlikely landmark for ''Futurama'' by critics due to its previous cancellation, the episode was criticized for failing to live up to its status as the series' 100th episode. Devo's guest appearance is one of co-producer and head writer [[David X. Cohen]]'s favorite moments in the series.\n\n==Plot==\nThe crew is hired for their 100th delivery and [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] plans the \"party of the millennium\". The wealthy widow [[Astor family|Astor]], invites [[Fry (Futurama)|Fry]] and [[Professor Farnsworth]] to a fundraiser for mutant education. [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]] notices that Astor and the socialites want to distract the mutants from their living conditions and [[social inequality]]. Fry accidentally reveals Leela as a mutant illegally living on the surface, and she is banished to the sewers. While attempting to appeal to Mayor Poopenmeyer on Leela's behalf, the crew is banished to the sewers for two weeks for harboring a mutant.\n\nIn the sewers, the crew finds the wreckage of the ''[[RMS Titanic|Land Titanic]]'', a luxury land bus that sunk into the street in 2912 after striking a mailbox on its maiden voyage, with Astor's husband among the ship's dead passengers. They find the original [[passenger name record|passenger manifest]] and a priceless quantum-force {{Not a typo|gemerald}} from Astor's husband to his wife. Fry attempts to reconcile with Leela, who rebuffs him. Determined to prove that he stands by Leela and mutants' plight, Fry jumps into the toxic sewage lake and emerges as a grotesque mutant blob. The crew is disgusted by Fry's new appearance, but Leela is touched by Fry's sacrifice and rallies the mutants and the crew to fight for equal rights. The mutants sabotage the sewer system by bending the main sewage pipe, which sends waste up to flood the surface.\n\nWhile the mutants demand desegregation and equal rights from Mayor Poopenmeyer, Astor tries to force them back underground using a wave of sewage held in [[Madison Square Garden|Madison Cube Garden]], but Fry uses the {{Not a typo|gemerald}}'s energy to part the wave and defend the mutants. He shows the mayor and Astor the ''Land Titanic'' passenger manifest, which includes Leela's maternal grandmother, who worked on the ''Land Titanic'' when it sunk. Leela's grandmother explains that Astor's husband gave up his reserved seat on the [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|life car]] for her and her mother. The widowed Astor is moved and urges Mayor Poopenmeyer to support mutant equality. As he and Leela kiss over their victory, Fry's grotesque form melts away, revealing itself to be Astor's mutated husband who fell into the toxic lake and survived as the ''Land Titanic'' sunk; Fry had unknowingly lodged himself in the mutant's mouth. The Astors happily reunite, and the Planet Express crew throw another party in celebration together with Leela's family, who are now allowed access to the surface.\n\n==Production==\nThe episode was written by [[Eric Horsted]] and directed by Raymie Muzquiz.  In an interview, series co-producer and head writer [[David X. Cohen]] stated that the 100th episode coinciding with the season finale was unplanned, with the staff only realizing it after receiving the broadcast schedule from Comedy Central.<ref name=\"iFMagInterview\">{{cite web|url=http://ifmagazine.com/feature.asp?article=3955 |title=Exclusive Interview: 'Futurama' Co-Creator David X.

The song \"Bend It\" by the British 1960s pop group [[Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich]] is used in this episode. The \"Westside Pipeway\" scene is reminiscent of a scene in the 1927 silent film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]''.<ref name=\"A.V.Club\" /> The program suggests that [[Brown University]] is now located in the mutant underground. They refer to it as an \"institution of lower learning. [http://theinfosphere.org/Transcript:The_Mutants_Are_Revolting] Leela also refers to the uprising of the mutants as the 'Million Mutant March' which references the '[[Million Man March]]'. The episode also contains self-references, such as the inclusion of many one-time and recurring characters in the background of Bender's party scene.<ref name=\"io9\" /> When Devo appear, they are asked to play \"[[Whip It (Devo song)|Whip It]]\", their most successful single. Refusing, they decide to play \"the other one\" and perform \"[[Beautiful World (Devo song)|Beautiful World]]\", one of only a few singles of theirs to find mainstream success. Near the end of the episode, Fry divides the wave of waste in two, preventing it from hitting the mutants and saying \"let my people stay\", which is the reference to the [[Crossing of the Red Sea]] and the \"[[Go Down Moses]]\" song. After this happens, one mutant says \"Are we not men!\" which is a reference to Devo's first album.\n\n==Broadcast and reception==\n\"The Mutants Are Revolting\" originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] on September 2, 2010.<ref name=\"Details\">{{cite web|url= http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/09/03/thursday-cable-ratings-jersey-shore-massive-american-chopper-up-futurama-down-more/62152|title=Thursday Cable Ratings: \u2018Jersey Shore\u2019 Massive, \u2018American Chopper\u2019 Up, \u2018Futurama\u2019 Down & More |last1 = Gorman | first1 = Bill |date=September 3, 2010 |work=TV By The Numbers |accessdate=2010-09-03 }}</ref>  In its original broadcast, \"The Mutants Are Revolting\" was viewed by an estimated population of 1.792 million with a 1.2 rating/2% share in [[Nielsen ratings]] and a 0.9 rating/2% share in the 18\u201349 demographic, going down two tenths of a point from the previous week's episode \"[[Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences]]\".<ref name=\"Details\" />\n\nThe episode was met with generally positive reviews from critics.

Three white men died in the confrontation, with at least one said to have been shot by his own side. \n\nIn the wake of the contested 1872 election for [[governor of Louisiana]] and local offices, a group of white [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] armed with rifles and a small cannon, overpowered [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[freedmen]] and state [[militia]] (also black) occupying the Grant Parish [[courthouse]] in Colfax.<ref name=\"Eric Foner p.437\">[[Eric Foner]], ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863\u20131877'', p. 437</ref><ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/grant/peopleevents/e_colfax.html ''Ulysses S.

There were rumors of mass graves at the site.\n\nHistorian [[Eric Foner]] described the massacre as the worst instance of racial violence during Reconstruction.<ref name=\"Eric Foner p.437\"/> In Louisiana, it had the most fatalities of any of the numerous violent events following the disputed gubernatorial contest in 1872 between [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. Foner wrote, \"...every election [in Louisiana] between 1868 and 1876 was marked by rampant violence and pervasive fraud.\"<ref name=\"Eric Foner 1989, p. 550\">Eric Foner, ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877'', New York: Perennial Library, 1989, p. 550</ref> Although the [[Electoral fusion|Fusionist]]-dominated state \"returning board,\" which ruled on vote validity, initially declared [[John McEnery (Louisiana)|John McEnery]] and his Democratic slate the winners, the board eventually split, with a faction declaring Republican [[William P.

A Republican federal judge in New Orleans ruled that the Republican-majority legislature be seated.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=b13}}</ref>\n\nFederal prosecution and conviction of a few perpetrators at Colfax under the [[Enforcement Acts]] was appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. In a key case, the court ruled in ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'' (1876) that protections of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] did not apply to the actions of individuals, but only to the actions of state governments. After this ruling, the federal government could no longer use the [[Enforcement Act of 1870]] to prosecute actions by [[paramilitary organizations|paramilitary groups]] such as the [[White League]], which had chapters forming across Louisiana beginning in 1874. Intimidation, murders, and black voter suppression by such paramilitary groups were instrumental to the Democratic Party regaining political control in the state legislature by the late 1870s.\n\nIn the late 20th and early 21st centuries, historians have paid renewed attention to the events at Colfax and the resulting Supreme Court case, and their meaning in American history.\n\n==State and national background==\n\nIn March 1865, Unionist planter [[James Madison Wells]] became governor. As the Democratic-dominated legislature passed Black Codes that restricted rights of freedmen, Wells began to lean toward allowing blacks to vote and temporarily [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchising]] ex-Confederates. To accomplish this, he scheduled a new constitutional convention for July 30, 1866.<ref>{{Cite book|title=By One Vote|last=Holt|first=Michael|publisher=University Press of Kansas|year=2008|isbn=|location=Lawrence, Kansas|pages=195\u201396}}</ref>\n\nIt was postponed because of the [[New Orleans Massacre]] that day, in which armed Southern white Democrats attacked blacks who had a parade in support of the convention. Anticipating trouble, the mayor of New Orleans had asked the local military commander to police the city and protect the convention. The U. S. Army failed to promptly respond to the mayor's request and a group of numerous unarmed blacks was attacked by whites, resulting in 38 deaths: 34 black and four white; and more than 40 wounded, most of them black.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Reconstruction|last=Craven|first=Avery|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston|year=1969|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=186\u201387}}</ref> \n\nWhen President [[Andrew Johnson]] blamed the [[massacre]] on Republican agitation, a popular national backlash against Johnson's policies led to national voters electing a majority Republican Congress in 1866. It passed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]] over Andrew Johnson's veto. Earlier the Freedmen's Bureau and the occupation armies had prevented Southern [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]], which had limited the rights of freedmen and other blacks, (including their choices of work and living locations) from going into effect.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of the South|last=Simkins|first=Francis|last2=Roland|first2=Charles|publisher=Alfred A.

Almost all of the victims were black and some white Republicans who were protecting the black Republican freedmen. Insurgents also attacked men physically or burned their homes to discourage them from voting. President Johnson, a Democrat, prevented the Republican governor of Louisiana from using either the state militia or U.S. forces to suppress the insurgent groups, such as the [[Knights of the White Camelia]].<ref name=\"Lane\">{{harvnb|Lane|2008}}</ref>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n==Background in Grant Parish==\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{one source|section|date=June 2019}}\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2019}}\n}}\nThe Red River area of Winn and Rapides parishes was a combination of large plantations and subsistence farmers; before the war, African Americans had worked as slaves on the plantations.{{cn|date=June 2019}} William Smith Calhoun, a major planter, had inherited a {{convert|14000|acre|km2|adj=on}} plantation in the area.<ref> Lane 2008, p. 25</ref> A former slaveholder, he lived with a [[mixed-race]] woman as his common-law wife and had come to support black political equality.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\nOn election day in November 1868, Calhoun led a group of freedmen to vote.{{cn|date=June 2019}} The ballot box was originally at a store owned by John Hooe,{{cn|date=June 2019}} who had threatened to whip freedmen \"if they voted Republican\".<ref> Lane 2008, p. 27</ref> Calhoun arranged for the ballot box to be switched to a plantation store owned by a Republican.{{cn|date=June 2019}} The Republicans received 318 votes, and the Democrats received 49.<ref> Lane 2008, p. 28</ref> A group of whites threw the ballot box into the Red River, and Democrats arrested Calhoun, alleging election fraud.{{cn|date=June 2019}} With the original ballot box gone, Democrat Michael Ryan went on to claimed a landslide victory.<ref> Lane 2008, p. 41</ref>{{what|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe election was also marked by violence.{{cn|date=June 2019}} Election commissioner Hal Frazier, a black Republican, was murdered by whites.<ref> Lane 2008, p. 41f</ref> After this, Calhoun drafted a bill to create a new parish out of parts of [[Winn Parish|Winn]] and [[Rapides Parish|Rapides]] parishes, which passed the Republican legislature; as a major planter, Calhoun thought he would have more political influence in the new parish, which had a black majority.{{cn|date=June 2019}} Other new parishes were created by the Republican state legislature to try to develop areas of Republican political support.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\n==Enforcement against the Klan==\n{{one source|section|date=June 2019}}\nAccording to Lane, after [[Ulysses S.

Among his appointments, he installed William Ward, a black [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] veteran, as commanding officer of Company A, 6th Infantry Regiment, Louisiana State Militia, a new unit to be based in Grant Parish to help control the violence there and in other Red River parishes. Ward, born a slave in 1840 in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], had learned to read and write as a valet to a master in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. In 1864 he escaped and went to [[Fortress Monroe]], where he joined the [[Union Army]] and served until after General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s surrender. About 1870 he came to Grant Parish, where he had a friend. He quickly became active among local blacks in the Republican Party. After his appointment to the militia, Ward recruited other freedmen for his forces, several of whom were veterans of the war.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|pp=54\u201356}}</ref>\n\n==Louisiana election of 1872==\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}\nIn Louisiana, Republican governor [[Henry Clay Warmoth]] defected from the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republicans]] (a group that opposed President Grant's [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]) policies in 1872. Warmoth previously supported a constitutional amendment that allowed former Confederates, who had been denied the right to vote, to be re-enfranchised. A \"Fusionist\" coalition of Liberal Republicans and Democrats nominated ex-Confederate battalion commander and Democrat [[John McEnery (politician)|John McEnery]] to succeed him as governor. In return, Democrats and Liberal Republicans were to send Warmoth to Washington as a [[U.S. Senator]]. Opposing McEnery was Republican [[William Pitt Kellogg]], one of Louisiana's U.S. Senators. Voting on November 4, 1872, resulted in dual governments, as a Fusionist (Liberal Republicans and Democrat)-dominated returning board declared McEnery the winner while a faction of the board proclaimed Kellogg the winner. Both administrations held inaugural ceremonies and certified their lists of local candidates.\n\nAfter failing to win their case in state court, the Kellogg forces appealed to federal judge Edward Durell in [[New Orleans]] to intervene and order that Kellogg and the Stalwart Republican-majority legislature were to be seated, and for Grant to authorize U.S. army troops to protect Kellogg's government. This action was widely criticized across the nation by Democrats and both wings of the Republican Party because it was considered to be a violation of the rights of states to manage their own (non-federal-office) elections. Thus, investigating committees of both chambers of the federal Congress in Washington were critical of the Kellogg choice. The House majority ruled Durell's action illegal and the Senate majority concluded that the Kellogg regime was \"not much better than a successful conspiracy.\" In 1874 a House investigating committee in Washington recommended that Judge Durell be impeached for corruption and illegally interfering in the Louisiana 1872 state elections, but the judge resigned in order to avoid impeachment.<ref>William Hesseltine, \"Grant the Politician\", 344</ref><ref>Charles Lane, *The Green Bag*, \"Edward Henry Durell,\" 167-68</ref>\n\nMcEnery's faction tried to take control of the state arsenal at [[Jackson Square, New Orleans|Jackson Square]], but Kellogg had the state militia seize dozens of leaders of McEnery's faction and control New Orleans, where the state government was located.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}} McEnery returned to try to take control with a private paramilitary group. In September 1873 his forces, over 8,000 strong, entered the city and defeated the city/state militia of about 3500 in New Orleans. The Democrats took control of the state house, armory and police stations, where the state government was then located, in what was known as the Battle of Jackson Square. His forces held those buildings for three days before retreating before Federal troops arrived.<ref name=\"Eric Foner 1989, p. 550\" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=General James Longstreet|last=Wert|first=Jeffry|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=1993|isbn=|location=New York|pages=416}}</ref> Warmoth was subsequently impeached by the state legislature in a bribery scandal stemming from his actions in the 1872 election.\n\nWarmoth appointed Democrats as parish registrars, and they ensured the voter rolls included as many whites and as few freedmen as possible. A number of registrars changed the registration site without notifying blacks. They also required blacks to prove they were over 21, while knowing that former slaves did not have birth certificates. In Grant Parish, one plantation owner threatened to expel blacks from homes they rented on his land if they voted Republican. Fusionists also tampered with ballot boxes on election day. One was found with a hole in it, apparently used for stuffing the ballot box. As a result, Grant Parish Fusionists claimed a landslide victory, even though black voters outnumbered whites by 776 to 630.\n\nWarmoth issued commissions to Fusionist Democrats Alphonse Cazabat and [[Christopher Columbus Nash]], elected parish judge and sheriff, respectively. Like many white men in the South, Nash was a Confederate veteran (as an officer, he had been held for a year and a half as a [[prisoner of war]] at [[Johnson's Island]] in [[Ohio]]). Cazabat and Nash took their oaths of office in the Colfax courthouse on January 2, 1873. They dispatched the documents to Governor McEnery in New Orleans.\n\nWilliam Pitt Kellogg issued commissions to the Republican slate for Grant Parish on January 17 and 18. By then Nash and Cazabat controlled the small, primitive courthouse. Republican Robert C. Register insisted that he, not Alphonse Cazabat, was the parish judge and that Republican Daniel Wesley Shaw, not Nash, was to be the sheriff. On the night of March 25, the Republicans seized the empty courthouse and took their oaths of office. They sent their oaths to the Kellogg administration in New Orleans.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nGrant Parish was one of a number of new parishes created by the Republican government in an effort to build local support in the state. Both the land and its people were originally tied to the Calhoun family, whose plantation had covered more than the borders of the new parish. The freedmen had been slaves on the plantation. The parish also took in the less-developed hill country. The total population had a narrow majority of 2400 freedmen, who mostly voted Republican, and 2200 whites, who voted as Democrats. Statewide political tensions were reflected in the rumors going around each community, often about white fears of black attacks or outrage, which added to local tensions.<ref name=\"libertychapelcemetery.org\">[http://www.libertychapelcemetery.org/files/hogue-colfax.pdf James K.

Whites were recruited from nearby Winn and surrounding parishes to join their effort. The Republicans Shaw, Register, and Flowers and others began to collect a posse of armed blacks to defend the courthouse.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nBlack Republicans Lewis Meekins and state militia captain William Ward, a black [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] veteran, raided the homes of the opposition leaders: Judge William R. Rutland, Bill Cruikshank, and Jim Hadnot. Gunfire erupted between whites and blacks on April 2 and again on April 5, but the shotguns were too inaccurate to do any harm. The two sides arranged for peace negotiations. Peace ended when a white man shot and killed a black man named Jesse McKinney, described as a bystander. Another armed conflict on April 6 ended with whites fleeing from armed blacks.<ref> Lane 2008, p. 154</ref> With all the unrest in the community, black women and children joined the men at the courthouse for protection.\n\nWilliam Ward, the commanding officer of Company A, 6th Infantry Regiment, Louisiana State Militia, headquartered in Grant Parish, had been elected state representative from the parish on the Republican ticket.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=56}}</ref> He wrote to Governor Kellogg seeking U.S. troops for reinforcement and gave the letter to William Smith Calhoun for delivery. Calhoun took the steamboat ''LaBelle'' down the Red River but was captured by Paul Hooe, Hadnot, and Cruikshank. They ordered Calhoun to tell blacks to leave the courthouse.\n\nThe black defenders refused to leave although threatened by parties of armed whites commanded by Nash. To recruit men during the rising political tensions, Nash had contributed to lurid rumors that blacks were preparing to kill all the white men and take the white women as their own.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/colfaxmassacreun00keit/page/117 Keith (2007), ''The Colfax Massacre''], p. 117</ref> On April 8 the anti-Republican ''[[Daily Picayune]]'' newspaper of New Orleans inflamed tensions and distorted events by the following headline: \n\n{{quote|THE RIOT IN GRANT PARISH. FEARFUL ATROCITIES BY THE NEGROES. NO RESPECT SHOWN TO THE DEAD.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=84}}</ref>}}\n\nSuch news attracted more whites from the region to Grant Parish to join Nash; all were experienced Confederate veterans. They acquired a four-pound cannon that could fire iron slugs. As the Klansman Dave Paul said, \"Boys, this is a struggle for [[white supremacy]].\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=91}}</ref>\n\nSuffering from [[tuberculosis]] and [[rheumatism]], on April 11 the militia captain Ward took a steamboat downriver to New Orleans to seek armed help directly from Kellogg. He was not there for the following events.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=57}}</ref>\n\n==Massacre==\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}\nCazabat had directed Nash as sheriff to put down what he called a riot. Nash gathered an armed white [[paramilitary]] group and veteran officers from [[Rapides Parish, Louisiana|Rapides]], [[Winn Parish, Louisiana|Winn]] and [[Catahoula Parish, Louisiana|Catahoula]] parishes. He did not move his forces toward the courthouse until noon on Easter Sunday, April 13. Nash led more than 300 armed white men, most on horseback and armed with rifles. Nash reportedly ordered the defenders of the courthouse to leave. When that failed, Nash gave women and children camped outside the courthouse thirty minutes to clear out. After they left, the shooting began. The fighting continued for several hours with few casualties. When Nash's paramilitary maneuvered the cannon behind the building, some of the defenders panicked and left the courthouse.\n\nAbout 60 defenders ran into nearby woods and jumped into the river. Nash sent men on horseback after the fleeing black Republicans, and his paramilitary group killed most of them on the spot. Soon Nash's forces directed a black captive to set the courthouse roof on fire. The defenders displayed [[white flag]]s for surrender: one made from a shirt, the other from a page of a book. The shooting stopped.\n\nNash's group approached and called for those surrendering to throw down their weapons and come outside. What happened next is in dispute. According to the reports of some whites, James Hadnot was shot and wounded by someone from the courthouse. \"In the Negro version, the men in the courthouse were stacking their guns when the white men approached, and Hadnot was shot from behind by an overexcited member of his own force.\"<ref>Nicholas Lemann, ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War'', New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux, paperback, 2007, p.18</ref> Hadnot died later, after being taken downstream by a passing steamboat.<ref>Lemann (2007), ''Redemption,'' p. 18</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of Hadnot's shooting, the white paramilitary group reacted with mass murders of the black men. As more than 40 times as many blacks died as did whites, historians describe the event as a massacre. The white paramilitary group killed unarmed men trying to hide in the courthouse. They rode down and killed those attempting to flee. They dumped some bodies in the Red River. About 50 blacks survived the afternoon and were taken prisoner. Later that night they were summarily killed by their captors, who had been drinking. Only one black from the group, Levi Nelson, survived. He was shot by Cruikshank but managed to crawl away unnoticed. He later served as one of the Federal government's chief witnesses against those who were [[Indictment|indicted]] for the attacks.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=124}}</ref>\n\nKellogg sent state militia colonels Theodore DeKlyne and William Wright to Colfax with warrants to arrest 50 white men and to install a new, compromise slate of parish officers. DeKlyne and Wright found the smoking ruins of the courthouse at Colfax, and many bodies of men who had been shot in the back of the head or the neck. They described that one body was charred, another man's head was beaten beyond recognition, and another had a slashed throat. Surviving blacks told DeKlyne and Wright that blacks dug a trench around the courthouse to protect it from what they saw as an attempt by white Democrats to steal an election. They were attacked by whites armed with rifles, revolvers and a small cannon. When blacks refused to leave, the courthouse was burned, and the black defenders were shot down. While the whites accused blacks of violating a flag of truce and rioting, black Republicans said that none of this was true. They accused whites of marching captured prisoners away in pairs and shooting them in the back of the head.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nOn April 14 some of Governor Kellogg's new police force arrived from New Orleans. Several days later, two companies of Federal troops arrived. They searched for white paramilitary members, but many had already fled to [[Texas]] or the hills. The officers filed a military report in which they identified by name three whites and 105 blacks who had died, plus noted they had recovered 15-20 unidentified blacks from the river. They also noted the savage nature of many of the killings, suggesting an out-of-control situation.<ref name=\"ftp.rootsweb.com\">[http://ftp.rootsweb.com/pub/usgenweb/la/state/history/military/uncat/colfaxr.txt \"Military Report on Colfax Riot, 1875\"], ''Congressional Record''], accessed Apr 6, 2008</ref>\n\nThe exact number of dead was never established: two U.S. Marshals, who visited the site on April 15 and buried dead, reported 62 fatalities;<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=265}}</ref> a military report to [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1875 identified 81 black men by name who had been killed,<ref>[https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=vcsr&GSvcid=117316 Find a grave memorial on the Colfax Massacre has 80 names listed]</ref> and also estimated that between 15 and 20 bodies had been thrown into the Red River, and another 18 were secretly buried, for a grand total of \"at least 105\";<ref name=\"Lane 256-66\">{{harvnb|Lane|2008|pp=265\u201366}}</ref> a state historical marker from 1950 noted fatalities as three whites and 150 blacks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Colfax Riot Historical Marker|author=Louisiana Department of Culture, Recreation and Tourism|year=1950 |url=http://www.stoppingpoints.com/louisiana/Grant/Colfax+Riot.html}}</ref>\n\nThe historian Eric Foner, a specialist in the Civil War and Reconstruction, wrote about the event:\n\n{{quote|The bloodiest single instance of racial carnage in the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction era]], the Colfax massacre taught many lessons, including the lengths to which some opponents of Reconstruction would go to regain their accustomed authority.

Lewis]] later remarked. \"They attempted [armed self-defense] in Colfax. The result was that on [[Easter Sunday]] of 1873 when the sun went down that night, it went down on the corpses of two hundred and eighty negroes.\"<ref name=\"Eric Foner p.437\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}\n[[James Roswell Beckwith]], the US Attorney based in New Orleans, sent an urgent telegram about the massacre to the [[Attorney General of the United States|U.S. Attorney General]]. The massacre in Colfax gained headlines of national newspapers from [[Boston]] to [[Chicago]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=22}}</ref> Various government forces spent weeks trying to round up members of the white paramilitaries, and a total of 97 men were indicted. In the end, Beckwith charged nine men and brought them to trial for violations of the [[Enforcement Act of 1870]]. It had been designed to provide federal protection for [[civil rights]] of freedmen under the [[14th Amendment of the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] against actions by [[terrorist]] groups such as the Klan.\n\nThe men were charged with one murder, and charges related to a conspiracy against the rights of freedmen. There were two succeeding trials in 1874. [[William Burnham Woods]] presided over the first trial and was sympathetic to the prosecution. Had the men been convicted, they would not have been able to appeal their decision to any appellate court according to the laws of the time. However, Beckworth was unable to secure a conviction\u2014one man was acquitted, and a mistrial was declared in the cases of the other eight. \n\nIn the second trial, three men were found guilty of sixteen charges. However, the presiding judge, [[Joseph Bradley]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]] ([[circuit justice|riding circuit]]), dismissed the convictions, ruling that the charges violated the [[state actor]] doctrine, failed to prove a racial rationale for the massacre, or were [[void for vagueness]]. ''[[Sua sponte]]'', he ordered that the men be released on bail, and they promptly disappeared.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}<ref>Nicholas Lemann, ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War'', New York; Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2006, p.25</ref>\n\nWhen the federal government appealed the case, it was heard by the US Supreme Court as ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'' (1875). The Supreme Court ruled that the Enforcement Act of 1870 (which was based on the Bill of Rights and 14th Amendment) applied only to actions committed by the state and that it did not apply to actions committed by individuals or private conspiracies (''See,'' [[Morrison Remick Waite]]). This meant that the Federal government could not prosecute cases such as the Colfax killings. The court said plaintiffs who believed their rights were abridged had to seek protection from the state. Louisiana did not prosecute any of the perpetrators of the Colfax massacre; most southern states would not prosecute white men for attacks against freedmen.\n\nThe publicity about the Colfax Massacre and subsequent Supreme Court ruling encouraged the growth of white [[paramilitary organizations]]. In May 1874, Nash formed the first chapter of the [[White League]] from his paramilitary group, and chapters soon were formed in other areas of Louisiana, as well as the southern parts of nearby states. Unlike the former KKK, they operated openly and often curried publicity. One historian described them as \"the military arm of the Democratic Party.\"<ref>George C. Rable, ''But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984, p. 132</ref> Other paramilitary groups such as the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] also arose, especially in [[South Carolina]] and [[Mississippi]], which also had black majorities of population, and in certain counties in North Carolina.\n\nParamilitary groups used violence and murder to terrorize leaders among the freedmen and white Republicans, as well as to repress voting among freedmen during the 1870s. Black American citizens had little recourse. In August 1874, for instance, the White League threw out Republican officeholders in [[Coushatta, Louisiana|Coushatta]], [[Red River Parish]], assassinating the six whites before they left the state, and killing five to 15 freedmen who were witnesses. Four of the white men killed were related to the state representative from the area.<ref>Eric Foner (2002),''Reconstruction'', p. 551</ref> Such violence served to intimidate voters and officeholders; it was one of the methods that white Democrats used to gain control of the state legislature in the 1876 elections and ultimately to dismantle Reconstruction in Louisiana.\n\n==Memorials==\nThe scale of the massacre and the political conflict it represents are of state and national significance in relation to Reconstruction and United States racial histories.{{cn|date=June 2019}} Despite this, the event has been hidden in local history for decades.{{cn|date=June 2019}} Moreover, the site has changed: some of the areas have been paved, and the old courthouse was torn down and a new courthouse was built.{{cn|date=June 2019}} Finally, without [[archeological]] work to establish where victims were buried at the site, people have had difficulty defining a site to gain approval for a historic memorial.{{cn|date=June 2019}} \n\nIn 1920, a committee met in Colfax to purchase a monument to memorialize the three white men who died.

A Republican federal judge in New Orleans ruled that the Republican-majority legislature be seated.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=b13}}</ref>\n\nFederal prosecution and conviction of a few perpetrators at Colfax under the [[Enforcement Acts]] was appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. In a key case, the court ruled in ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'' (1876) that protections of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] did not apply to the actions of individuals, but only to the actions of state governments. After this ruling, the federal government could no longer use the [[Enforcement Act of 1870]] to prosecute actions by [[paramilitary organizations|paramilitary groups]] such as the [[White League]], which had chapters forming across Louisiana beginning in 1874. Intimidation, murders, and black voter suppression by such paramilitary groups were instrumental to the Democratic Party regaining political control in the state legislature by the late 1870s.\n\nIn the late 20th and early 21st centuries, historians have paid renewed attention to the events at Colfax and the resulting Supreme Court case, and their meaning in American history.\n\n==State and national background==\n\nIn March 1865, Unionist planter [[James Madison Wells]] became governor. As the Democratic-dominated legislature passed Black Codes that restricted rights of freedmen, Wells began to lean toward allowing blacks to vote and temporarily [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchising]] ex-Confederates. To accomplish this, he scheduled a new constitutional convention for July 30, 1866.<ref>{{Cite book|title=By One Vote|last=Holt|first=Michael|publisher=University Press of Kansas|year=2008|isbn=|location=Lawrence, Kansas|pages=195\u201396}}</ref>\n\nIt was postponed because of the [[New Orleans Massacre]] that day, in which armed Southern white Democrats attacked blacks who had a parade in support of the convention. Anticipating trouble, the mayor of New Orleans had asked the local military commander to police the city and protect the convention. The U. S. Army failed to promptly respond to the mayor's request and a group of numerous unarmed blacks was attacked by whites, resulting in 38 deaths: 34 black and four white; and more than 40 wounded, most of them black.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Reconstruction|last=Craven|first=Avery|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston|year=1969|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=186\u201387}}</ref> \n\nWhen President [[Andrew Johnson]] blamed the [[massacre]] on Republican agitation, a popular national backlash against Johnson's policies led to national voters electing a majority Republican Congress in 1866.

Among his appointments, he installed William Ward, a black [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] veteran, as commanding officer of Company A, 6th Infantry Regiment, Louisiana State Militia, a new unit to be based in Grant Parish to help control the violence there and in other Red River parishes. Ward, born a slave in 1840 in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], had learned to read and write as a valet to a master in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. In 1864 he escaped and went to [[Fortress Monroe]], where he joined the [[Union Army]] and served until after General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s surrender. About 1870 he came to Grant Parish, where he had a friend. He quickly became active among local blacks in the Republican Party. After his appointment to the militia, Ward recruited other freedmen for his forces, several of whom were veterans of the war.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|pp=54\u201356}}</ref>\n\n==Louisiana election of 1872==\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}\nIn Louisiana, Republican governor [[Henry Clay Warmoth]] defected from the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republicans]] (a group that opposed President Grant's [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]) policies in 1872. Warmoth previously supported a constitutional amendment that allowed former Confederates, who had been denied the right to vote, to be re-enfranchised. A \"Fusionist\" coalition of Liberal Republicans and Democrats nominated ex-Confederate battalion commander and Democrat [[John McEnery (politician)|John McEnery]] to succeed him as governor. In return, Democrats and Liberal Republicans were to send Warmoth to Washington as a [[U.S. Senator]]. Opposing McEnery was Republican [[William Pitt Kellogg]], one of Louisiana's U.S. Senators. Voting on November 4, 1872, resulted in dual governments, as a Fusionist (Liberal Republicans and Democrat)-dominated returning board declared McEnery the winner while a faction of the board proclaimed Kellogg the winner. Both administrations held inaugural ceremonies and certified their lists of local candidates.\n\nAfter failing to win their case in state court, the Kellogg forces appealed to federal judge Edward Durell in [[New Orleans]] to intervene and order that Kellogg and the Stalwart Republican-majority legislature were to be seated, and for Grant to authorize U.S. army troops to protect Kellogg's government. This action was widely criticized across the nation by Democrats and both wings of the Republican Party because it was considered to be a violation of the rights of states to manage their own (non-federal-office) elections. Thus, investigating committees of both chambers of the federal Congress in Washington were critical of the Kellogg choice. The House majority ruled Durell's action illegal and the Senate majority concluded that the Kellogg regime was \"not much better than a successful conspiracy.\" In 1874 a House investigating committee in Washington recommended that Judge Durell be impeached for corruption and illegally interfering in the Louisiana 1872 state elections, but the judge resigned in order to avoid impeachment.<ref>William Hesseltine, \"Grant the Politician\", 344</ref><ref>Charles Lane, *The Green Bag*, \"Edward Henry Durell,\" 167-68</ref>\n\nMcEnery's faction tried to take control of the state arsenal at [[Jackson Square, New Orleans|Jackson Square]], but Kellogg had the state militia seize dozens of leaders of McEnery's faction and control New Orleans, where the state government was located.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}} McEnery returned to try to take control with a private paramilitary group. In September 1873 his forces, over 8,000 strong, entered the city and defeated the city/state militia of about 3500 in New Orleans. The Democrats took control of the state house, armory and police stations, where the state government was then located, in what was known as the Battle of Jackson Square. His forces held those buildings for three days before retreating before Federal troops arrived.<ref name=\"Eric Foner 1989, p. 550\" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=General James Longstreet|last=Wert|first=Jeffry|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=1993|isbn=|location=New York|pages=416}}</ref> Warmoth was subsequently impeached by the state legislature in a bribery scandal stemming from his actions in the 1872 election.\n\nWarmoth appointed Democrats as parish registrars, and they ensured the voter rolls included as many whites and as few freedmen as possible. A number of registrars changed the registration site without notifying blacks. They also required blacks to prove they were over 21, while knowing that former slaves did not have birth certificates. In Grant Parish, one plantation owner threatened to expel blacks from homes they rented on his land if they voted Republican. Fusionists also tampered with ballot boxes on election day. One was found with a hole in it, apparently used for stuffing the ballot box. As a result, Grant Parish Fusionists claimed a landslide victory, even though black voters outnumbered whites by 776 to 630.\n\nWarmoth issued commissions to Fusionist Democrats Alphonse Cazabat and [[Christopher Columbus Nash]], elected parish judge and sheriff, respectively. Like many white men in the South, Nash was a Confederate veteran (as an officer, he had been held for a year and a half as a [[prisoner of war]] at [[Johnson's Island]] in [[Ohio]]). Cazabat and Nash took their oaths of office in the Colfax courthouse on January 2, 1873. They dispatched the documents to Governor McEnery in New Orleans.\n\nWilliam Pitt Kellogg issued commissions to the Republican slate for Grant Parish on January 17 and 18. By then Nash and Cazabat controlled the small, primitive courthouse. Republican Robert C. Register insisted that he, not Alphonse Cazabat, was the parish judge and that Republican Daniel Wesley Shaw, not Nash, was to be the sheriff. On the night of March 25, the Republicans seized the empty courthouse and took their oaths of office. They sent their oaths to the Kellogg administration in New Orleans.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nGrant Parish was one of a number of new parishes created by the Republican government in an effort to build local support in the state. Both the land and its people were originally tied to the Calhoun family, whose plantation had covered more than the borders of the new parish. The freedmen had been slaves on the plantation. The parish also took in the less-developed hill country. The total population had a narrow majority of 2400 freedmen, who mostly voted Republican, and 2200 whites, who voted as Democrats. Statewide political tensions were reflected in the rumors going around each community, often about white fears of black attacks or outrage, which added to local tensions.<ref name=\"libertychapelcemetery.org\">[http://www.libertychapelcemetery.org/files/hogue-colfax.pdf James K.

Rutland, Bill Cruikshank, and Jim Hadnot. Gunfire erupted between whites and blacks on April 2 and again on April 5, but the shotguns were too inaccurate to do any harm. The two sides arranged for peace negotiations. Peace ended when a white man shot and killed a black man named Jesse McKinney, described as a bystander. Another armed conflict on April 6 ended with whites fleeing from armed blacks.<ref> Lane 2008, p. 154</ref> With all the unrest in the community, black women and children joined the men at the courthouse for protection.\n\nWilliam Ward, the commanding officer of Company A, 6th Infantry Regiment, Louisiana State Militia, headquartered in Grant Parish, had been elected state representative from the parish on the Republican ticket.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=56}}</ref> He wrote to Governor Kellogg seeking U.S. troops for reinforcement and gave the letter to William Smith Calhoun for delivery. Calhoun took the steamboat ''LaBelle'' down the Red River but was captured by Paul Hooe, Hadnot, and Cruikshank. They ordered Calhoun to tell blacks to leave the courthouse.\n\nThe black defenders refused to leave although threatened by parties of armed whites commanded by Nash. To recruit men during the rising political tensions, Nash had contributed to lurid rumors that blacks were preparing to kill all the white men and take the white women as their own.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/colfaxmassacreun00keit/page/117 Keith (2007), ''The Colfax Massacre''], p. 117</ref> On April 8 the anti-Republican ''[[Daily Picayune]]'' newspaper of New Orleans inflamed tensions and distorted events by the following headline: \n\n{{quote|THE RIOT IN GRANT PARISH.

They acquired a four-pound cannon that could fire iron slugs.

He was not there for the following events.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=57}}</ref>\n\n==Massacre==\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}\nCazabat had directed Nash as sheriff to put down what he called a riot. Nash gathered an armed white [[paramilitary]] group and veteran officers from [[Rapides Parish, Louisiana|Rapides]], [[Winn Parish, Louisiana|Winn]] and [[Catahoula Parish, Louisiana|Catahoula]] parishes. He did not move his forces toward the courthouse until noon on Easter Sunday, April 13. Nash led more than 300 armed white men, most on horseback and armed with rifles. Nash reportedly ordered the defenders of the courthouse to leave. When that failed, Nash gave women and children camped outside the courthouse thirty minutes to clear out. After they left, the shooting began. The fighting continued for several hours with few casualties. When Nash's paramilitary maneuvered the cannon behind the building, some of the defenders panicked and left the courthouse.\n\nAbout 60 defenders ran into nearby woods and jumped into the river. Nash sent men on horseback after the fleeing black Republicans, and his paramilitary group killed most of them on the spot. Soon Nash's forces directed a black captive to set the courthouse roof on fire. The defenders displayed [[white flag]]s for surrender: one made from a shirt, the other from a page of a book. The shooting stopped.\n\nNash's group approached and called for those surrendering to throw down their weapons and come outside. What happened next is in dispute. According to the reports of some whites, James Hadnot was shot and wounded by someone from the courthouse. \"In the Negro version, the men in the courthouse were stacking their guns when the white men approached, and Hadnot was shot from behind by an overexcited member of his own force.\"<ref>Nicholas Lemann, ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War'', New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux, paperback, 2007, p.18</ref> Hadnot died later, after being taken downstream by a passing steamboat.<ref>Lemann (2007), ''Redemption,'' p. 18</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of Hadnot's shooting, the white paramilitary group reacted with mass murders of the black men. As more than 40 times as many blacks died as did whites, historians describe the event as a massacre. The white paramilitary group killed unarmed men trying to hide in the courthouse. They rode down and killed those attempting to flee. They dumped some bodies in the Red River. About 50 blacks survived the afternoon and were taken prisoner. Later that night they were summarily killed by their captors, who had been drinking. Only one black from the group, Levi Nelson, survived. He was shot by Cruikshank but managed to crawl away unnoticed. He later served as one of the Federal government's chief witnesses against those who were [[Indictment|indicted]] for the attacks.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=124}}</ref>\n\nKellogg sent state militia colonels Theodore DeKlyne and William Wright to Colfax with warrants to arrest 50 white men and to install a new, compromise slate of parish officers. DeKlyne and Wright found the smoking ruins of the courthouse at Colfax, and many bodies of men who had been shot in the back of the head or the neck. They described that one body was charred, another man's head was beaten beyond recognition, and another had a slashed throat. Surviving blacks told DeKlyne and Wright that blacks dug a trench around the courthouse to protect it from what they saw as an attempt by white Democrats to steal an election. They were attacked by whites armed with rifles, revolvers and a small cannon. When blacks refused to leave, the courthouse was burned, and the black defenders were shot down. While the whites accused blacks of violating a flag of truce and rioting, black Republicans said that none of this was true. They accused whites of marching captured prisoners away in pairs and shooting them in the back of the head.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nOn April 14 some of Governor Kellogg's new police force arrived from New Orleans. Several days later, two companies of Federal troops arrived. They searched for white paramilitary members, but many had already fled to [[Texas]] or the hills. The officers filed a military report in which they identified by name three whites and 105 blacks who had died, plus noted they had recovered 15-20 unidentified blacks from the river.

The result was that on [[Easter Sunday]] of 1873 when the sun went down that night, it went down on the corpses of two hundred and eighty negroes.\"<ref name=\"Eric Foner p.437\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}\n[[James Roswell Beckwith]], the US Attorney based in New Orleans, sent an urgent telegram about the massacre to the [[Attorney General of the United States|U.S. Attorney General]]. The massacre in Colfax gained headlines of national newspapers from [[Boston]] to [[Chicago]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2008|p=22}}</ref> Various government forces spent weeks trying to round up members of the white paramilitaries, and a total of 97 men were indicted. In the end, Beckwith charged nine men and brought them to trial for violations of the [[Enforcement Act of 1870]]. It had been designed to provide federal protection for [[civil rights]] of freedmen under the [[14th Amendment of the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] against actions by [[terrorist]] groups such as the Klan.\n\nThe men were charged with one murder, and charges related to a conspiracy against the rights of freedmen. There were two succeeding trials in 1874. [[William Burnham Woods]] presided over the first trial and was sympathetic to the prosecution. Had the men been convicted, they would not have been able to appeal their decision to any appellate court according to the laws of the time. However, Beckworth was unable to secure a conviction\u2014one man was acquitted, and a mistrial was declared in the cases of the other eight. \n\nIn the second trial, three men were found guilty of sixteen charges. However, the presiding judge, [[Joseph Bradley]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]] ([[circuit justice|riding circuit]]), dismissed the convictions, ruling that the charges violated the [[state actor]] doctrine, failed to prove a racial rationale for the massacre, or were [[void for vagueness]]. ''[[Sua sponte]]'', he ordered that the men be released on bail, and they promptly disappeared.<ref name=\"Lane\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2013}}<ref>Nicholas Lemann, ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War'', New York; Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2006, p.25</ref>\n\nWhen the federal government appealed the case, it was heard by the US Supreme Court as ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'' (1875). The Supreme Court ruled that the Enforcement Act of 1870 (which was based on the Bill of Rights and 14th Amendment) applied only to actions committed by the state and that it did not apply to actions committed by individuals or private conspiracies (''See,'' [[Morrison Remick Waite]]). This meant that the Federal government could not prosecute cases such as the Colfax killings. The court said plaintiffs who believed their rights were abridged had to seek protection from the state. Louisiana did not prosecute any of the perpetrators of the Colfax massacre; most southern states would not prosecute white men for attacks against freedmen.\n\nThe publicity about the Colfax Massacre and subsequent Supreme Court ruling encouraged the growth of white [[paramilitary organizations]]. In May 1874, Nash formed the first chapter of the [[White League]] from his paramilitary group, and chapters soon were formed in other areas of Louisiana, as well as the southern parts of nearby states. Unlike the former KKK, they operated openly and often curried publicity. One historian described them as \"the military arm of the Democratic Party.\"<ref>George C. Rable, ''But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984, p. 132</ref> Other paramilitary groups such as the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] also arose, especially in [[South Carolina]] and [[Mississippi]], which also had black majorities of population, and in certain counties in North Carolina.\n\nParamilitary groups used violence and murder to terrorize leaders among the freedmen and white Republicans, as well as to repress voting among freedmen during the 1870s. Black American citizens had little recourse. In August 1874, for instance, the White League threw out Republican officeholders in [[Coushatta, Louisiana|Coushatta]], [[Red River Parish]], assassinating the six whites before they left the state, and killing five to 15 freedmen who were witnesses. Four of the white men killed were related to the state representative from the area.<ref>Eric Foner (2002),''Reconstruction'', p. 551</ref> Such violence served to intimidate voters and officeholders; it was one of the methods that white Democrats used to gain control of the state legislature in the 1876 elections and ultimately to dismantle Reconstruction in Louisiana.\n\n==Memorials==\nThe scale of the massacre and the political conflict it represents are of state and national significance in relation to Reconstruction and United States racial histories.{{cn|date=June 2019}} Despite this, the event has been hidden in local history for decades.{{cn|date=June 2019}} Moreover, the site has changed: some of the areas have been paved, and the old courthouse was torn down and a new courthouse was built.{{cn|date=June 2019}} Finally, without [[archeological]] work to establish where victims were buried at the site, people have had difficulty defining a site to gain approval for a historic memorial.{{cn|date=June 2019}} \n\nIn 1920, a committee met in Colfax to purchase a monument to memorialize the three white men who died.
