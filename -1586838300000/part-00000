In particular, ''S''('''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>) is a subspace of the [[function space]] ''C''<sup>\u221e</sup>('''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>) of infinitely differentiable functions.\n\n==Examples of functions in the Schwartz space==\n* If \u03b1 is a multi-index, and ''a'' is a positive real number, then\n\n::<math>x^\\alpha e^{-a |x|^2} \\in S(\\mathbf{R}^n).</math>\n\n* Any smooth function ''f'' with [[compact support]] is in ''S''('''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>). This is clear since any derivative of ''f'' is continuous and supported in the support of ''f'', so (''x''<sup>''\u03b1''</sup>''D''<sup>\u03b2</sup>) ''f'' has a maximum in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> by the [[extreme value theorem]].\n\n==Properties==\n* ''S''('''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>) is a [[Fr\u00e9chet space]] over the complex numbers.\n* From [[General Leibniz rule|Leibniz' rule]], it follows that ''S''('''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>) is also closed under [[Pointwise product|pointwise multiplication]]: if ''f'', ''g'' \u2208 ''S''('''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>), then ''fg'' \u2208 ''S''('''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>).\n* If 1 &le; ''p'' &le; &infin;, then ''S''('''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>) \u2282 [[Lp space|''L''<sup>p</sup>('''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>)]].\n* If 1 &le; ''p'' < &infin;, then ''S''('''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>) is dense in [[Lp space|''L''<sup>p</sup>('''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>)]].\n* The space of all [[bump function]]s, ''C''{{su|b=c|p=&infin;}}('''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>), is included in ''S''('''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>).\n* The Fourier transform is a linear isomorphism ''S''('''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>) \u2192 ''S''('''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>).\n* If ''f'' \u2208 ''S''('''R'''), then ''f'' is uniformly continuous on '''R'''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bump function]]\n* [[Schwartz\u2013Bruhat function]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n*{{cite book |authorlink=Lars H\u00f6rmander |first=L. |last=H\u00f6rmander |title=The Analysis of Linear Partial Differential Operators I, (Distribution theory and Fourier Analysis) |edition=2nd |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=1990 |isbn=3-540-52343-X }}\n*{{cite book |first=M. |last=Reed |first2=B. |last2=Simon |title=Methods of Modern Mathematical Physics: Functional Analysis I |edition=Revised and enlarged |publisher=Academic Press |location=San Diego |year=1980 |isbn=0-12-585050-6 }}\n*{{cite book |first=Elias M. |last=Stein |first2=Rami |last2=Shakarchi |title=Fourier Analysis: An Introduction (Princeton Lectures in Analysis I) |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-691-11384-X }}\n\n{{PlanetMath attribution|id=4444|title=Space of rapidly decreasing functions}}\n\n{{Functional analysis}}\n\n[[Category:Topological vector spaces]]\n[[Category:Smooth functions]]\n[[Category:Fourier analysis]]\n[[Category:Function spaces]]\n", "name_user": "Peek-a-boo-88", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDefinition", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwartz_space"}

Among them are ''[[wikt:specie|specie]]'', ''[[wikt:species|species]]''.\n\nFor those with [[happy-tensing|''happy''-tensing]] accents, the final ''y'' in words ending ''-cy'' has the FLEECE vowel, and therefore so do [[inflection|inflected forms]] ending ''-cies'' or ''-cied'' (''fancied'', ''policies'', etc.).\n\nIf the vowel of NEAR ({{IPA|/\u026a\u0259r/|}}) is considered as \"long e\", then words ending ''-cier'' may also be exceptions. Possible examples include: ''fancier'', if pronounced with two rather than three syllables; or ''financier'', if stressed on the final syllable or pronounced with a ''happy''-tensing accent.\n\n====With other sounds====\nThese are exceptions to the basic and \"long a\" versions of the rhyme, but not to the \"long e\" version.\n\nTypes include:\n* Adding suffix ''-er'' to root in ''-cy'', giving a two-syllable ending ''-cier''; For example, ''fancier'' (adjective \"more fancy\", or noun \"one who fancies\")\n* Words of Latin origin with a root ending in ''c(i)'' followed by a suffix or inflexion starting in ''(i)e''; such as \n** [[wikt:facio#Latin|''fac'' or ''fic'']] \"do; make\" (''efficient, stupefacient'', etc.) \n** ''[[wikt:socius#Latin|soc]]'' \"sharing; kin\" (''society'')\n** ''[[wikt:scio#Latin|sci]]'' \"know\" (''science, prescient'', etc.)\n*Others: ''ancient'', ''concierge'', ''glacier''\n\n===ei not preceded by c===\nMany words have ''ei'' not preceded by ''c''.  In the sections which follow, most derived forms are omitted; for example, as well as ''seize'', there exist ''disseize'' and ''seizure''. Words are grouped by the [[phoneme]]s (sounds) corresponding to ''ei'' or ''ie'' in the spelling; each phoneme is represented phonetically as at [[Help:IPA/English]] and, where applicable, by the keyword in [[John C. Wells]]' [[lexical set]]s.\n\nAn asterisk* after a word indicates the pronunciation implied is one of several found.  Some have an {{IPA|/i\u02d0/|}} variant [[American and British English pronunciation differences|more common in America than Britain]] (e.g. ''sheikh'', ''leisure'', ''either'' have {{IPA|/e\u026a/|}}, {{IPA|/\u025b/|}}, {{IPA|/a\u026a/|}} respectively).\n\n====With the \"long e\" vowel{{anchor|Strictest exceptions}}====\nWords where ''ei'', not preceded by ''c'', represents the vowel of FLEECE ({{IPA|/i\u02d0/|}}), are the only exceptions to the strictest British interpretation of the \"long e\" version of the rhyme. Less strict interpretations admit as exceptions those words where ''eir'', not preceded by ''c'', represents the vowel of NEAR ({{IPA|/\u026a\u0259r/|}}).\n\nSome categories of exception:\n* Many [[proper name]]s, often because they are adopted from other languages. Fowler says the rule \"is useless with proper names\";<ref name=\"fowler26\"/> Carney says \"As one might expect of any rule, there are likely to be even more exceptions in names, many of which are Scottish\":<ref>Carney 1994, \u00a73.3.2.2 p.161</ref>\n** forenames and surnames ''Keith, Neil, Sheila, Stein'', etc.\n** placenames ''[[Leith]], [[Keighley]]'', ''[[Rheims]]'', ''[[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]]'', etc.\n** ''Eid'' in the names of [[Muslim holidays]] ([[Eid ul-Fitr]], [[Eid al-Adha]], etc.)\n** others like ''[[Cassiopeia (Queen of Aethiopia)|Cassiopeia]]''\n*[[Chemical name]]s ending in ''-ein'' or ''-eine'' (''caffeine, casein, codeine, phthalein, protein,'' etc.). Here ''-ein(e)'' was originally pronounced as two syllables {{IPA|/i\u02d0.\u026an/|}}\n*[[Scottish English]] words  (''deil, deid, weill,'' etc.) Mark Wainwright writes \"There are many exceptions in Scots, so speakers with a large Scots vocabulary may as well give up on this rule.\"<ref name=\"Wainwright1997\"/>\n\nOther exceptions:\n;{{IPA|/i\u02d0/|}} FLEECE: ''either*, heinous*, inveigle*, keister, leisure*, monteith, neither*, obeisance*, seize, seizin, sheikh*, teiid'' \n;{{IPA|/\u026a\u0259r/|}} NEAR: ''madeira, weir, weird''.  (This sound may also be spelled ''ier'', as in ''pierce''.)\n\n====With the \"long a\" vowel====\nThere are many words where ''ei'', not preceded by ''c'', represents the vowel of FACE ({{IPA|/e\u026a/|}}). There are a few where ''eir'', not preceded by ''c'', represents the vowel of SQUARE ({{IPA|/\u025b\u0259r/|}}). These groups of words are exceptions only to the basic form of the rhyme; they are excluded from both of the common restricted forms.\n\n;{{IPA|/e\u026a/|}} FACE: \n* With ''eigh'' spelling: ''eight, freight, heigh-ho*, inveigh, neigh, neighbo(u)r, sleigh, weigh''\n* Others: ''abseil, beige, capoeira,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/capoeira|title=Definition of capoeira|work=Collins English Dictionary|publisher=Collins|accessdate=4 April 2013}}</ref> cleidoic, deign, dreidel, feign, feint, geisha, glei, greige, greisen,  heinous*, inveigle*, nonpareil*, obeisance*,  peignoir*, reign, rein, seiche, seidel, seine, sheikh*, skein, surveillance, veil, vein''.

The rhyme was used as a climactic plot device in the 1990 ''[[TaleSpin]]'' episode \"Vowel Play\" when Kit corrects Baloo's spelling by reciting the second half (\"or when sounding like A, as in neighbour or weigh\") of the mnemonic.\n\n''I Before E (Except After C): Old-School Ways To Remember Stuff'' was a [[miscellany]] released in the UK for the Christmas 2007 \"[[stocking filler]]\" market,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3669867/Mnemony-clever-ways-to-remember-stuff.html|title=Mnemony clever ways to remember stuff|date=12 December 2007|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=25 February 2011}}</ref> which sold well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/ba-book-prize-lists-20.html|title=BA book prize lists 20|date=26 August 2008|work=[[The Bookseller]]|accessdate=25 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n\"I Before E Except After C\" is a song on [[Yazoo (band)|Yazoo]]'s 1982 album ''[[Upstairs at Eric's]]''.

If one is not sure whether a word is spelled with the sequence ''ei'' or ''ie'', the rhyme suggests that the correct order is ''ie'' unless the preceding letter is ''c'', in which case it is ''ei''. For example:\n* ''ie'' in ''bel'''ie'''ve'', ''f'''ie'''rce'', ''coll'''ie''''', ''d'''ie''''', ''fr'''ie'''nd''<!--one example per sound represented by the 'ie' -->\n* ''ei'' after ''c'' in ''rec'''ei'''ve'', ''c'''ei'''ling'', ''rec'''ei'''pt'', ''c'''ei'''lidh''<!--one example per sound represented by the 'ei' -->\n\nThe rule is very well known; Edward Carney calls it \"this supreme, and for many people solitary, spelling rule\".<ref name=\"carney678\"/>\n\nThe rule is sometimes taught without regard for the particular [[Phonology of English|sound]] represented by the spelling, and sometimes taught as applying only to particular pronunciations.  Two common restrictions are:\n* excluding cases where the spelling represents the \"long a\"<ref group=\"n\" name=\"longv\">The labels \"long a\" and \"long e\", deprecated among educators, are used here as [[umbrella term]]s for multiple [[lexical set]]s and [[diaphoneme]]s.</ref> sound (the [[lexical set]]s of FACE {{IPAc-en|e\u026a}} and perhaps SQUARE {{IPAc-en|\u025b\u0259r}}).

In French loanwords, the digraph <ie> generally represented the sound {{IPA|[e\u02d0]}}, while <ei> represented {{IPA|[\u025b\u02d0]}}. However, [[Early Modern English]] spelling was not fixed; many words were spelled with <ie> and <ei> interchangeably, in printed works of the seventeenth century and private correspondence of educated people into the nineteenth century. In the [[Great Vowel Shift]], sounds {{IPA|[e\u02d0]}} and {{IPA|[\u025b\u02d0]}} were [[Raising (phonetics)|raised]] to {{IPA|[i\u02d0]}} and {{IPA|[e\u02d0]}} respectively, with the latter subsequently becoming the [[diphthong]] {{IPA|[e\u026a]}}.

It is not a general [[graphotactic]] rule applicable to other phonemes. So, although ''seize'' and ''heinous'' (if you pronounce it with {{IPA|/i\u02d0/|}} rather than {{IPA|/e\u026a/|}}) are exceptions, ''heifer'', ''leisure'' with {{IPA|/e/|}}\u2261<ei> or ''rein'', ''vein'' with {{IPA|/e\u026a/|}}\u2261<ei> are not exceptions; <ie> is not a usual spelling of {{IPA|/e/|}} or {{IPA|/e\u026a/|}}.\nAs to the usefulness of the rule, he says:<ref>Carney 1994, p.74</ref>\n:Such rules are warnings against common pitfalls for the unwary.

Among them are ''[[wikt:specie|specie]]'', ''[[wikt:species|species]]''.\n\nFor those with [[happy-tensing|''happy''-tensing]] accents, the final ''y'' in words ending ''-cy'' has the FLEECE vowel, and therefore so do [[inflection|inflected forms]] ending ''-cies'' or ''-cied'' (''fancied'', ''policies'', etc.).\n\nIf the vowel of NEAR ({{IPA|/\u026a\u0259r/|}}) is considered as \"long e\", then words ending ''-cier'' may also be exceptions. Possible examples include: ''fancier'', if pronounced with two rather than three syllables; or ''financier'', if stressed on the final syllable or pronounced with a ''happy''-tensing accent.\n\n====With other sounds====\nThese are exceptions to the basic and \"long a\" versions of the rhyme, but not to the \"long e\" version.\n\nTypes include:\n* Adding suffix ''-er'' to root in ''-cy'', giving a two-syllable ending ''-cier''; For example, ''fancier'' (adjective \"more fancy\", or noun \"one who fancies\")\n* Words of Latin origin with a root ending in ''c(i)'' followed by a suffix or inflexion starting in ''(i)e''; such as \n** [[wikt:facio#Latin|''fac'' or ''fic'']] \"do; make\" (''efficient, stupefacient'', etc.) \n** ''[[wikt:socius#Latin|soc]]'' \"sharing; kin\" (''society'')\n** ''[[wikt:scio#Latin|sci]]'' \"know\" (''science, prescient'', etc.)\n*Others: ''ancient'', ''concierge'', ''glacier''\n\n===ei not preceded by c===\nMany words have ''ei'' not preceded by ''c''.  In the sections which follow, most derived forms are omitted; for example, as well as ''seize'', there exist ''disseize'' and ''seizure''. Words are grouped by the [[phoneme]]s (sounds) corresponding to ''ei'' or ''ie'' in the spelling; each phoneme is represented phonetically as at [[Help:IPA/English]] and, where applicable, by the keyword in [[John C. Wells]]' [[lexical set]]s.\n\nAn asterisk* after a word indicates the pronunciation implied is one of several found.  Some have an {{IPA|/i\u02d0/|}} variant [[American and British English pronunciation differences|more common in America than Britain]] (e.g. ''sheikh'', ''leisure'', ''either'' have {{IPA|/e\u026a/|}}, {{IPA|/\u025b/|}}, {{IPA|/a\u026a/|}} respectively).\n\n====With the \"long e\" vowel{{anchor|Strictest exceptions}}====\nWords where ''ei'', not preceded by ''c'', represents the vowel of FLEECE ({{IPA|/i\u02d0/|}}), are the only exceptions to the strictest British interpretation of the \"long e\" version of the rhyme. Less strict interpretations admit as exceptions those words where ''eir'', not preceded by ''c'', represents the vowel of NEAR ({{IPA|/\u026a\u0259r/|}}).\n\nSome categories of exception:\n* Many [[proper name]]s, often because they are adopted from other languages. Fowler says the rule \"is useless with proper names\";<ref name=\"fowler26\"/> Carney says \"As one might expect of any rule, there are likely to be even more exceptions in names, many of which are Scottish\":<ref>Carney 1994, \u00a73.3.2.2 p.161</ref>\n** forenames and surnames ''Keith, Neil, Sheila, Stein'', etc.\n** placenames ''[[Leith]], [[Keighley]]'', ''[[Rheims]]'', ''[[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]]'', etc.\n** ''Eid'' in the names of [[Muslim holidays]] ([[Eid ul-Fitr]], [[Eid al-Adha]], etc.)\n** others like ''[[Cassiopeia (Queen of Aethiopia)|Cassiopeia]]''\n*[[Chemical name]]s ending in ''-ein'' or ''-eine'' (''caffeine, casein, codeine, phthalein, protein,'' etc.). Here ''-ein(e)'' was originally pronounced as two syllables {{IPA|/i\u02d0.\u026an/|}}\n*[[Scottish English]] words  (''deil, deid, weill,'' etc.) Mark Wainwright writes \"There are many exceptions in Scots, so speakers with a large Scots vocabulary may as well give up on this rule.\"<ref name=\"Wainwright1997\"/>\n\nOther exceptions:\n;{{IPA|/i\u02d0/|}} FLEECE: ''either*, heinous*, inveigle*, keister, leisure*, monteith, neither*, obeisance*, seize, seizin, sheikh*, teiid'' \n;{{IPA|/\u026a\u0259r/|}} NEAR: ''madeira, weir, weird''.  (This sound may also be spelled ''ier'', as in ''pierce''.)\n\n====With the \"long a\" vowel====\nThere are many words where ''ei'', not preceded by ''c'', represents the vowel of FACE ({{IPA|/e\u026a/|}}).

The original books were also made into an [[OVA]], [[animated cartoon|animated feature-length films]], [[anime]], and comic.\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{See also|List of Kaiketsu Zorori characters}}\n\nSet in a parallel world inhabited by anthropomorphic animals (in their Earth's version of Japan), the story follows the protagonist, a fox named Zorori and his twin boar bandit apprentices Ishishi and Noshishi as they travel from place to place. The series debuted in 1987 with its first issue: {{nihongo|'''''Kaiketsu Zorori no Doragon Taiji'''''|\u304b\u3044\u3051\u3064\u30be\u30ed\u30ea\u306e\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u305f\u3044\u3058||\"The Incredible Zorori, Dragon Slayer\"}} and has published about two issues per year, totaling 50 issues as of December 2011. It was adapted into an anime series from February 1, 2004 to January 28, 2007. A Hong Kong produced English dubbed version by Red Angel Media aired on [[Cartoon Network Philippines]] on January 4, 2010. \n\nZorori was originally a villain for the series {{nihongo|'''''H\u014drens\u014d Man'''''|\u307b\u3046\u308c\u3093\u305d\u3046\u30de\u30f3||\"Spinach Man\"}} written by Shiho Mitsushima, and when H\u014drens\u014d Man ended, Shiho Mitsushima understood the need to give it an independent spin-off. What both series shared in common was that the end of {{nihongo|'''''H\u014drens\u014d Man no Y\u016breij\u014d'''''|\u307b\u3046\u308c\u3093\u305d\u3046\u30de\u30f3\u306e\u3086\u3046\u308c\u3044\u3058\u3087\u3046||\"Spinach Man and the Haunted Castle\"}} (depicts Zorori leaving on a journey to get a castle) ties in with the beginning of Kaiketsu Zorori no Doragon Taiji and Zorori's aspiration, \"Zorori Castle Part 2\" is established (It appears Part 1 came from the Zorori Castle in H\u014drens\u014d Man no Y\u016breij\u014d). Another part is the reoccurring characters (Zorori Mama and Y\u014dkai Gakk\u014d no Sensei, and to some degree the debut of Sumire and Bokushi Robo) that were not given anything past trivial appearances. However, knowing the background story of the H\u014drens\u014d Man series is not needed to be able to enjoy the Zorori series.\n\nUsing clear patterns and lines, the characters would speak using speech bubbles more similar to comics than to picture books. The text and words would not use any difficult [[kanji]] or any [[furigana]], instead using lower grade level words so that it can be read alone without needing any help. It also features excessive puns and it is because of this that puns saw a boom in use in elementary school students. In spite of it being called a well read elementary school \"children's book\", it has an array of farting, belching, and vulgar words that sometimes parents and guardians in the [[parent-teacher association|PTA]] demanded apologies for it. Whenever Zorori is in a desperate situation and it appears he'll reach his demise, a fake notice is posted advising to skip the next page due to gruesome violence (Of course this is all a joke. The next page just has him finding a way out of his predicament).\n\nAt the time of publication, '''{{nihongo|''The Zorori League''|\u30be\u30ed\u30ea\u30fc\u30b0|Zororiigu}}''' and '''{{nihongo|''Stupid Monster''|\u30dc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc|Bokeetto Monsutaa}}''' (a play on [[Pok\u00e9mon]]) were very popular comedies, especially among Japanese comedians for its use of Japanese jokes.\n\nFurthermore, the Spanish word for fox is \"zorro\", and the author intended for Kaiketsu Zorori to resemble [[Zorro]].\n\n==List of volumes==\nThe first Zorori book was released in November 1987 and has seen two releases per year ever since. The first 39 volumes have been used as source material for the anime, while volumes 40 and beyond are book only, due to being printed after the anime's cancellation. \n{{Graphic novel list/header\n |

Every chocolate bar is a winner, but the winning message is printed on the white chocolate that's in-between the dark and milk chocolate layers. To win someone would have to lick away both sides of the chocolate to reach the center. Zorori does just that and goes to claim his prize, only to be told he still has to complete an obstacle course to reach and win his castle. Zorori manages to win the castle and set it adrift, only to have it melt in a warmer southern climate.

The original books were also made into an [[OVA]], [[animated cartoon|animated feature-length films]], [[anime]], and comic.\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{See also|List of Kaiketsu Zorori characters}}\n\nSet in a parallel world inhabited by anthropomorphic animals (in their Earth's version of Japan), the story follows the protagonist, a fox named Zorori and his twin boar bandit apprentices Ishishi and Noshishi as they travel from place to place. The series debuted in 1987 with its first issue: {{nihongo|'''''Kaiketsu Zorori no Doragon Taiji'''''|\u304b\u3044\u3051\u3064\u30be\u30ed\u30ea\u306e\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u305f\u3044\u3058||\"The Incredible Zorori, Dragon Slayer\"}} and has published about two issues per year, totaling 50 issues as of December 2011. It was adapted into an anime series from February 1, 2004 to January 28, 2007. A Hong Kong produced English dubbed version by Red Angel Media aired on [[Cartoon Network Philippines]] on January 4, 2010. \n\nZorori was originally a villain for the series {{nihongo|'''''H\u014drens\u014d Man'''''|\u307b\u3046\u308c\u3093\u305d\u3046\u30de\u30f3||\"Spinach Man\"}} written by Shiho Mitsushima, and when H\u014drens\u014d Man ended, Shiho Mitsushima understood the need to give it an independent spin-off. What both series shared in common was that the end of {{nihongo|'''''H\u014drens\u014d Man no Y\u016breij\u014d'''''|\u307b\u3046\u308c\u3093\u305d\u3046\u30de\u30f3\u306e\u3086\u3046\u308c\u3044\u3058\u3087\u3046||\"Spinach Man and the Haunted Castle\"}} (depicts Zorori leaving on a journey to get a castle) ties in with the beginning of Kaiketsu Zorori no Doragon Taiji and Zorori's aspiration, \"Zorori Castle Part 2\" is established (It appears Part 1 came from the Zorori Castle in H\u014drens\u014d Man no Y\u016breij\u014d). Another part is the reoccurring characters (Zorori Mama and Y\u014dkai Gakk\u014d no Sensei, and to some degree the debut of Sumire and Bokushi Robo) that were not given anything past trivial appearances. However, knowing the background story of the H\u014drens\u014d Man series is not needed to be able to enjoy the Zorori series.\n\nUsing clear patterns and lines, the characters would speak using speech bubbles more similar to comics than to picture books. The text and words would not use any difficult [[kanji]] or any [[furigana]], instead using lower grade level words so that it can be read alone without needing any help. It also features excessive puns and it is because of this that puns saw a boom in use in elementary school students. In spite of it being called a well read elementary school \"children's book\", it has an array of farting, belching, and vulgar words that sometimes parents and guardians in the [[parent-teacher association|PTA]] demanded apologies for it. Whenever Zorori is in a desperate situation and it appears he'll reach his demise, a fake notice is posted advising to skip the next page due to gruesome violence (Of course this is all a joke. The next page just has him finding a way out of his predicament).\n\nAt the time of publication, '''{{nihongo|''The Zorori League''|\u30be\u30ed\u30ea\u30fc\u30b0|Zororiigu}}''' and '''{{nihongo|''Stupid Monster''|\u30dc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc|Bokeetto Monsutaa}}''' (a play on [[Pok\u00e9mon]]) were very popular comedies, especially among Japanese comedians for its use of Japanese jokes.\n\nFurthermore, the Spanish word for fox is \"zorro\", and the author intended for Kaiketsu Zorori to resemble [[Zorro]].\n\n==List of volumes==\nThe first Zorori book was released in November 1987 and has seen two releases per year ever since. The first 39 volumes have been used as source material for the anime, while volumes 40 and beyond are book only, due to being printed after the anime's cancellation. \n{{Graphic novel list/header\n |

Out of desperation he eats an entire room filled with garlic, leaving him with a terrible smell.

An officer comes by and tells him the toy plane was stolen and the boars said they took it by mistake. They run from the police and end up on Money's plane, but partway through the flight the plane has engine trouble and crashes into a snowy mountain. Zorori builds a new plane from the remains and they fly off. They are low on gas when a red plane comes out of nowhere and points them to a nearby city. The red plane quickly vanishes and they get Money back home safely. Zorori is left wondering if the pilot was his father.

It was first broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 24 October 2015. It was written by [[Catherine Tregenna]] and directed by [[Edward Bazalgette|Ed Bazalgette]].\n\nSet in 1651, about 800 years after the previous week's episode \"[[The Girl Who Died]]\", the episode follows the alien [[Time travel in fiction|time traveller]] the [[Twelfth Doctor]] ([[Peter Capaldi]]), while on the trail of an alien artefact that came to Earth, reuniting with [[Ashildr]] ([[Maisie Williams]]), the woman the Doctor made immortal in the previous episode. Ashildr, having renamed herself \"Me\", had isolated herself from mortal humans and seeks to use the artefact herself to travel to other planets.\n\n==Plot==\nAlone and on the trail of an alien artefact, the [[Twelfth Doctor]] interrupts a highwayman known as \"the Knightmare\" carrying out a highway robbery of Lucie Fanshawe in 1651 England. The Doctor finds the artefact in the coach's luggage but the vehicle drives off before he can take it. The Doctor finds that the robber is in fact [[Ashildr]], the Viking girl he made immortal.{{refn|group=N|name=\"girl-died\"|As depicted in the previous week's episode \"[[The Girl Who Died]]\".}} Over her 800 years of everlasting life, she has lost many of her memories, and has isolated herself in order to avoid the pain of losing loved ones. The Doctor learns that she has renamed herself \"Me\" due to her loneliness. He also discovers that Me previously had three children, all of whom she lost to the [[Black Death]].\n\nMe and the Doctor steal the artefact from Lucie's house, flee by climbing out of the chimney and escape an ambush by a rival highwayman, Sam Swift. The next morning, the Doctor meets Me's ally Leandro, a leonine alien stranded on Earth who uses the artefact to open portals into space. In return for Me tricking the Doctor into helping him, Leandro has agreed to let her come with him to travel the galaxy. However, in order for the portal to be activated, the artefact requires another person's death. Two pikemen, unaware that Me is the Knightmare, arrive to announce that the Knightmare is reported to be in the area and Sam Swift is about to be hanged at [[Tyburn]]. Me hands the Doctor over to them, claiming that he is the Knightmare's sidekick, and sets off to use Swift's death to activate the artefact.\n\nThe Doctor escapes the pikemen by offering them Me's treasury and pursues Me to the hanging. Me attaches the artefact to Swift's chest, killing him and opening a portal. Leandro then reveals that his actual intent is to assist his people in invading Earth. Spaceships begin destroying the crowd gathered to watch the hanging. Me, rediscovering her conscience and humanity after seeing the crowds slaughtered, uses the second Mire medical chip given to her by the Doctor{{refn|group=N|name=\"girl-died\"}} to save Swift's life and close the portal. Leandro's people kill him for his failure. Afterwards, Me states that she will remain the Doctor's friend and will look after those that the Doctor leaves behind.\n\n===Continuity===\nThe Doctor informs Me that the imminent [[Great Fire of London]] was caused by the Terileptils, referring to the [[Fifth Doctor]] story, ''[[The Visitation (Doctor Who)|The Visitation]]'' (1982).<ref name=\"doctorwhotv.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/the-woman-who-lived-hints-teasers-set-1-77215.htm|title=The Woman Who Lived: Hints & Teasers (Set #1)|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=\"bbcamerica.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2015/10/doctor-who-10-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-woman-who-lived/|title=\u2018Doctor Who': 10 Things You May Not Know About \u2018The Woman Who Lived\u2019 - Anglophenia - BBC America|work=BBC America}}</ref>\n\nThe Doctor states that he is \"on record as being against banter\".

It was first broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 24 October 2015. It was written by [[Catherine Tregenna]] and directed by [[Edward Bazalgette|Ed Bazalgette]].\n\nSet in 1651, about 800 years after the previous week's episode \"[[The Girl Who Died]]\", the episode follows the alien [[Time travel in fiction|time traveller]] the [[Twelfth Doctor]] ([[Peter Capaldi]]), while on the trail of an alien artefact that came to Earth, reuniting with [[Ashildr]] ([[Maisie Williams]]), the woman the Doctor made immortal in the previous episode. Ashildr, having renamed herself \"Me\", had isolated herself from mortal humans and seeks to use the artefact herself to travel to other planets.\n\n==Plot==\nAlone and on the trail of an alien artefact, the [[Twelfth Doctor]] interrupts a highwayman known as \"the Knightmare\" carrying out a highway robbery of Lucie Fanshawe in 1651 England. The Doctor finds the artefact in the coach's luggage but the vehicle drives off before he can take it. The Doctor finds that the robber is in fact [[Ashildr]], the Viking girl he made immortal.{{refn|group=N|name=\"girl-died\"|As depicted in the previous week's episode \"[[The Girl Who Died]]\".}} Over her 800 years of everlasting life, she has lost many of her memories, and has isolated herself in order to avoid the pain of losing loved ones. The Doctor learns that she has renamed herself \"Me\" due to her loneliness. He also discovers that Me previously had three children, all of whom she lost to the [[Black Death]].\n\nMe and the Doctor steal the artefact from Lucie's house, flee by climbing out of the chimney and escape an ambush by a rival highwayman, Sam Swift. The next morning, the Doctor meets Me's ally Leandro, a leonine alien stranded on Earth who uses the artefact to open portals into space. In return for Me tricking the Doctor into helping him, Leandro has agreed to let her come with him to travel the galaxy. However, in order for the portal to be activated, the artefact requires another person's death. Two pikemen, unaware that Me is the Knightmare, arrive to announce that the Knightmare is reported to be in the area and Sam Swift is about to be hanged at [[Tyburn]]. Me hands the Doctor over to them, claiming that he is the Knightmare's sidekick, and sets off to use Swift's death to activate the artefact.\n\nThe Doctor escapes the pikemen by offering them Me's treasury and pursues Me to the hanging. Me attaches the artefact to Swift's chest, killing him and opening a portal. Leandro then reveals that his actual intent is to assist his people in invading Earth. Spaceships begin destroying the crowd gathered to watch the hanging. Me, rediscovering her conscience and humanity after seeing the crowds slaughtered, uses the second Mire medical chip given to her by the Doctor{{refn|group=N|name=\"girl-died\"}} to save Swift's life and close the portal. Leandro's people kill him for his failure. Afterwards, Me states that she will remain the Doctor's friend and will look after those that the Doctor leaves behind.\n\n===Continuity===\nThe Doctor informs Me that the imminent [[Great Fire of London]] was caused by the Terileptils, referring to the [[Fifth Doctor]] story, ''[[The Visitation (Doctor Who)|The Visitation]]'' (1982).<ref name=\"doctorwhotv.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/the-woman-who-lived-hints-teasers-set-1-77215.htm|title=The Woman Who Lived: Hints & Teasers (Set #1)|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=\"bbcamerica.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2015/10/doctor-who-10-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-woman-who-lived/|title=\u2018Doctor Who': 10 Things You May Not Know About \u2018The Woman Who Lived\u2019 - Anglophenia - BBC America|work=BBC America}}</ref>\n\nThe Doctor states that he is \"on record as being against banter\".
