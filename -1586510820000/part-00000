On 30 October 1981 at the meeting organised to mark silver jubilee celebration of the School of International Studies, Gandhi said, \u201cA country\u2019s policy is shaped by many forces- its position on the map, and the countries which are its neighbours, the policies they adopt, and the actions they take, as well as its historical experiences in the aggregate and in terms of its particular success or traumas.\u201d<ref name=\"speech\">{{cite web |last1=Speech |first1=Gandhi |title=India and Its Foreign Policy |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0020881782021002001 |website=https://journals.sagepub.com/ |publisher=SAGE Journals |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Non-aligned Movement==\n[[File:Indira Gandhi & Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu.jpg|thumb|Gandhi with [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]] in 1969]]\n\nIn the early 1980s under Gandhi, India attempted to reassert its prominent role in the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] by focusing on the relationship between disarmament and economic development. By appealing to the economic grievances of [[Developing country|developing countries]], Gandhi and her successors exercised a moderating influence on the Non-aligned movement, diverting it from some of the [[Cold War]] issues that marred the controversial 1979 Havana meeting where Cuban leader [[Fidel Castro]] attempted to steer the movement towards the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gupte|first1=Pranay|title=Mother India : a political biography of Indira Gandhi|date=2011|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=9780143068266|pages=499\u2013500|edition=Rev.|url={{Google books|OOmK1lPWq80C|page=PR9|keywords=%22non%20aligned%20movement%22%20india%20indira|text=|plainurl=yes}}}}</ref> Although hosting the 1983 summit at Delhi boosted Indian prestige within the movement, its close relations with the [[Soviet Union]] and its pro-Soviet positions on [[Afghanistan]] and [[Cambodia]] limited its influence.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} Gandhi boosted the NAM summit in New Delhi in 1967 to strengthen the unity and co-operation among Afro-Asian countries.\n\n==Indo-US==\n[[File:President Reagan walking with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi outside the Oval Office.jpg|thumb|President Reagan walking with Indira outside the oval office]]\nWhen Indira came to power in 1966, on invitation from the US President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], Gandhi visited the US on 28 March 1966. During her visit, the Indo-US Education Foundation was formulated, but could not materialize due to strong opposition in India. America had suspended aid to India in 1965 at the time of the Indo-Pak war. However, the visit helped India secure more food and development aid from the US. Johnson promised three million tons of food and nine million in aid. Indira resented the US policy of food aid as a tool in forcing India to adopt policies favored by the US. She also resolutely refused to sign the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|NPT]] (Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons).\n\nRelations with US strained badly under President [[Richard Nixon]] when India signed the [[Indo-Bangla Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Peace|treaty of peace]], Friendship and Co-operation with Russia in 1971. Nixon favoring of Pakistan during the Bangladesh liberation war vehemently criticized India for interfering with the internal affairs of Pakistan. Despised Indira politically and personally Nixon ordered complete stoppage of economic assistance and supply of defense equipment to India.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Van Dijk|first1=Ruud|last2=Glenn Gray|first2=William|last3=Savranskaya|first3=Svetlana|last4=Suri|first4=Jeremi|last5=Zhai|first5=Qiang (editors)|title=Encyclopedia of the Cold War.|date=2008|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=9780203880210|pages=340\u2013341|url={{Google books|QgX0bQ3Enj4C|page=PR3|keywords=%22indira%20gandhi%22%20johnson|text=|plainurl=yes}}}}</ref> Gandhi remained resolute in her support to Bangladesh, despite US attempts to force India to commit to a ceasefire.

United states reacted negatively, especially in light of then ongoing negotiations on the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] and the economic aid the US had provided to India. This issue caused a stalemate in the relations between the two countries. However, the United States concluded that the test did not violate any agreement and proceeded with a June 1974 shipment of enriched uranium for the [[Tarapur Atomic Power Station|Tarapur reactor]]. The visit of [[Henry Kissinger]], the [[United States Secretary of State|secretary of the state of the US]], to India in October 1974, helped to bridge the gap between the two countries, Gandhi\u2019s imposition of emergency in 1975 strained the Indo-US relation.\n\nIndira met then US President President [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1981 for the first time at the [[North\u2013South Summit]] held to discuss global poverty. Gandhi\u2019s 1982 visit, at then US President [[Ronald Reagan]]\u2019s invitation, turned out to be markedly successful, with agreeing on cooperation in science and technology and signing an agreement on the Tarapur nuclear plant and to mark 1985 as the \u2018year of India\u2019 in the US.<ref name=\"Ronald Reagan\">{{cite news |last1=A friendship |first1=India-USA: |title=India-USA: A friendship that began way back then |url=https://www.rediff.com/news/special/modi-in-us-india-usa-a-friendship-that-began-way-back-then/20140926.htm |accessdate=4 April 2020 |work=Rediff.com |agency=Rediff |date=September 26, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Soviet Union==\nThe relationship between India and the [[Soviet Union]] deepened during Gandhi's rule. The main reason was the perceived bias of United States and [[China]], the rivals of USSR, towards [[Pakistan]]. The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and casting of veto at United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Prior to the war Indira signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. In the beginning, India was not willing for Indo-Soviet treaty. But circumstances forced India to have a treaty with the Soviet Union in 1971. The circumstances were I. Pindi-Peking -washington axis was formed by 1971, mainly against the USSR to curb its influence in South Asia and secondarily against India. The refugess from East Pakistan flooded India. So, the responsibility fell on India to protect East Pakistan against the West Pakistan. At this juncture, China and USA came to support Pakistan and at his situation India was forced to have a treaty with the Soviet Union. Had India not concluded a treaty with USSR, its prestige would have been at stake.\n\nThe Soviets were not happy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Indira was not happy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept from criticizing the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Indira years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods. Under Indira by the early 1980s the Soviets became the largest trading partner of India.<ref name=\"British Academic Press\">{{cite book|last1=Light|first1=Margot (Editor)|last2=Duncan|first2=Peter J.S.

America had suspended aid to India in 1965 at the time of the Indo-Pak war. However, the visit helped India secure more food and development aid from the US. Johnson promised three million tons of food and nine million in aid. Indira resented the US policy of food aid as a tool in forcing India to adopt policies favored by the US. She also resolutely refused to sign the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|NPT]] (Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons).\n\nRelations with US strained badly under President [[Richard Nixon]] when India signed the [[Indo-Bangla Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Peace |treaty of peace]], Friendship and Co-operation with Russia in 1971.

United states reacted negatively, especially in light of then ongoing negotiations on the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] and the economic aid the US had provided to India. This issue caused a stalemate in the relations between the two countries. However, the United States concluded that the test did not violate any agreement and proceeded with a June 1974 shipment of enriched uranium for the [[Tarapur Atomic Power Station|Tarapur reactor]]. The visit of [[Henry Kissinger]], the [[United States Secretary of State | secretary of the state of the US]], to India in October 1974, helped to bridge the gap between the two countries, Gandhi\u2019s imposition of emergency in 1975 strained the Indo-US relation.\n\nIndira met then US President President [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1981 for the first time at the [[North\u2013South Summit]] held to discuss global poverty.

The main reason was the perceived bias of United States and [[China]], the rivals of USSR, towards [[Pakistan]]. The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and casting of veto at United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Prior to the war Indira signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. In the beginning, India was not willing for Indo-Soviet treaty. But circumstances forced India to have a treaty with the Soviet Union in 1971. The circumstances were I. Pindi-Peking -washington axis was formed by 1971, mainly against the USSR to curb its influence in South Asia and secondarily against India. The refugess from East Pakistan flooded India. So, the responsibility fell on India to protect East Pakistan against the West Pakistan. At this juncture, China and USA came to support Pakistan and at his situation India was forced to have a treaty with the Soviet Union. Had India not concluded a treaty with USSR, its prestige would have been at stake.\n\nThe Soviets were not happy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Indira was not happy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept from criticizing the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Indira years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods. Under Indira by the early 1980s the Soviets became the largest trading partner of India.<ref name=\"British Academic Press\">{{cite book|last1=Light|first1=Margot (Editor)|last2=Duncan|first2=Peter J.S.

Relations between ASEAN and India was mutually antagonistic.

On their part, the ASEAN nations were unhappy with Gandhi's sympathy for the [[Viet Cong]] and India's strong links with the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Furthermore, they were also apprehensions in the region about Gandhi's future plans, particularly after India played a big role in breaking up Pakistan and facilitating in the emergence of Bangladesh as a sovereign country in 1971.

The CBI had opposed Rathore's plea and had sought an enhancement of his sentence from six months to the maximum of two years after his conviction. Rejecting his appeal against his conviction by a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) special court, Chandigarh District Court on 25 May sentenced the disgraced former police official to one-and-a-half years of rigorous imprisonment, enhancing his earlier six-month sentence and immediately taken into custody and taken to the Burail prison.<ref name=\"ht-power\">[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-12-23/india/28076879_1_rathore-ruchika-girhotra-haryana-lawn-tennis-association Ruchika Girhotra Case: Molestation of Minor, Abuse of Power].

Rathore had learnt that Singh was constructing a house in Gurgaon, and offered to provide building materials and other assistance. Singh also found out that Rathore had also approached the Investigating Officer for the case, Rajesh Ranjan, CBI's Deputy Superintendent of Police.

There are 23 stands (all of them are self-maneuvering) of which 16 are remote, with 42 check-in desks and 16 boarding gates. Since its last enlargement in 1991 for the [[Seville Expo '92]], the airport has undergone minor extension works. 2013 saw the opening of a new car parking building with five floors. It is currently being remodeled to expand its capacity to ten million passengers a year, completion of the works by 2021.\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}\nIn 1914, the first plane flying between the peninsula and [[Morocco]] landed at the improvised aerodrome of Tablada, which had been fitted out the previous year for an air festival. Following this, the municipal government of [[Seville]] handed over a plot of land measuring {{convert|240000|m2|abbr=on}} to the Military Aeronautical Society for the construction of an aerodrome. Work on the aerodrome began in 1915 and that same year it began to be used for training pilots and observers.\n\nIn 1919 the first commercial flights were operated between Seville and Madrid. The following year, an [[Airmail|air postal service]] was established between Seville and [[Larache]] and in 1921, the first Spanish commercial service between Seville and Larache was set up. In 1923, various facilities such as [[hangar]]s, workshops and premises were opened and approval was given for the construction of a municipal airport in Tablada at one end of the military aerodrome airfield, measuring {{convert|750|by|500|m|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn April 1927, Uni\u00f3n A\u00e9rea Espa\u00f1ola established the air service Madrid-Seville-Lisbon. In February 1929, the Seville airport project was approved and in March, the Tablada aerodrome was opened to flights and air traffic. It was decided that this service would cease once the planned airport was constructed.\n\nIn 1929 the first flight was operated between Madrid and Seville and in 1930, this was extended to the [[Canary Islands]]. In February 1931, the service between Berlin and Barcelona was extended to Seville. In December 1933, [[LAPE]] began a service between Seville and the Canary Islands.\n\nDuring the [[Spanish civil war]], Seville became the arrival point for African troops, whilst [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]] served air transport with flights between [[Tetu\u00e1n]]-Seville-[[Vitoria-Gasteiz|Vitoria]], Seville-[[Salamanca]] and Seville-Larache-[[Las Palmas]].\n\nIn September 1945, works began on the Seville transoceanic airport, with the construction of runways 05/23, 02/20 and 09/27. One year later, it was classified as a customs point and runways 05/23 and 02/20 were asphalted. In 1948, a goniometer was installed, the runway lighting was completed, and the runways became known as 04/22, 18/36 and 09/27. In 1956, runway 09/27 was extended and runway 18/36 became a taxiway.\n\nIn 1957, works were carried out on the terminal building and the control tower. Seville Airport was then included in the Hispanic American Agreement for the installation of a supplies base. The facilities were developed near the threshold of 04, rendering the runway out of service.\n\nIn 1965 an Instrument Landing System was installed. Between 1971 and 1975, the terminal area was renovated, the apron was extended, a new terminal building was constructed and new access roads were developed.\n\nIn 1989, with a focus on the [[Seville Expo '92]], the apron was extended, and a new access from the national [[Carretera Nacional N-IV|motorway N-IV]] was opened; a new terminal building and a new control tower to the south of the runway were also built. On 31 July, the new installations were inaugurated.\n{{clear}}\n\nThe new terminal expansion program was begun in 2019 to cope with rapid passenger growth.\n\n==Airlines and

There are 23 stands (all of them are self-maneuvering) of which 16 are remote, with 42 check-in desks and 16 boarding gates. Since its last enlargement in 1991 for the [[Seville Expo '92]], the airport has undergone minor extension works. 2013 saw the opening of a new car parking building with five floors. It is currently being remodeled to expand its capacity to ten million passengers a year, completion of the works by 2021.\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}\nIn 1914, the first plane flying between the peninsula and [[Morocco]] landed at the improvised aerodrome of Tablada, which had been fitted out the previous year for an air festival. Following this, the municipal government of [[Seville]] handed over a plot of land measuring {{convert|240000|m2|abbr=on}} to the Military Aeronautical Society for the construction of an aerodrome. Work on the aerodrome began in 1915 and that same year it began to be used for training pilots and observers.\n\nIn 1919 the first commercial flights were operated between Seville and Madrid. The following year, an [[Airmail|air postal service]] was established between Seville and [[Larache]] and in 1921, the first Spanish commercial service between Seville and Larache was set up. In 1923, various facilities such as [[hangar]]s, workshops and premises were opened and approval was given for the construction of a municipal airport in Tablada at one end of the military aerodrome airfield, measuring {{convert|750|by|500|m|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn April 1927, Uni\u00f3n A\u00e9rea Espa\u00f1ola established the air service Madrid-Seville-Lisbon. In February 1929, the Seville airport project was approved and in March, the Tablada aerodrome was opened to flights and air traffic. It was decided that this service would cease once the planned airport was constructed.\n\nIn 1929 the first flight was operated between Madrid and Seville and in 1930, this was extended to the [[Canary Islands]]. In February 1931, the service between Berlin and Barcelona was extended to Seville. In December 1933, [[LAPE]] began a service between Seville and the Canary Islands.\n\nDuring the [[Spanish civil war]], Seville became the arrival point for African troops, whilst [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]] served air transport with flights between [[Tetu\u00e1n]]-Seville-[[Vitoria-Gasteiz|Vitoria]], Seville-[[Salamanca]] and Seville-Larache-[[Las Palmas]].\n\nIn September 1945, works began on the Seville transoceanic airport, with the construction of runways 05/23, 02/20 and 09/27. One year later, it was classified as a customs point and runways 05/23 and 02/20 were asphalted. In 1948, a goniometer was installed, the runway lighting was completed, and the runways became known as 04/22, 18/36 and 09/27. In 1956, runway 09/27 was extended and runway 18/36 became a taxiway.\n\nIn 1957, works were carried out on the terminal building and the control tower. Seville Airport was then included in the Hispanic American Agreement for the installation of a supplies base. The facilities were developed near the threshold of 04, rendering the runway out of service.\n\nIn 1965 an Instrument Landing System was installed. Between 1971 and 1975, the terminal area was renovated, the apron was extended, a new terminal building was constructed and new access roads were developed.\n\nIn 1989, with a focus on the [[Seville Expo '92]], the apron was extended, and a new access from the national [[Carretera Nacional N-IV|motorway N-IV]] was opened; a new terminal building and a new control tower to the south of the runway were also built. On 31 July, the new installations were inaugurated.\n{{clear}}\n\nThe new terminal expansion program was begun in 2019 to cope with rapid passenger growth.\n\n==Airlines and

W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=9780415252256|location=|pages=412}}</ref>  He is the younger brother of architect [[Rob Krier]].\n\n== Biography ==\nKrier abandoned his architectural studies at the [[University of Stuttgart]], Germany, in 1968, after only one year, to work in the office of architect [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]] in [[London]], UK. After four years working for Stirling, interrupted by a two years association with [[Josef Paul Kleihues]] in Berlin, Krier spent 20 years in England practicing and teaching at the [[Architectural Association]] and [[Royal College of Art]]. In this period, Krier's statement: \u201cI am an architect, because I don\u2019t build\u201d,<ref>Ian Latham, \"L\u00e9on Krier. A Profile....\", ''Architectural Design'', vol. 57, no 1/2, 1987, p.37</ref> became a famous expression of his uncompromising anti-modernist attitude. From the late 1970s onwards he has been one of the most influential modern traditional architects and planners. He is one of the first and most prominent critics of architectural modernism, mainly of its functional zoning and the ensuing suburbanism, campaigning for the reconstruction of the traditional European city model and its growth based on the polycentric city model.\n\nHis ideas had a great influence on the [[New Urbanism]] movement, both in the USA and Europe. The most complete compilation of them is published in his book [http://www.placemakers.com/2009/05/08/what-were-reading-leon-kriers-architecture-of-community/ ''The Architecture of Community''.]\n\n[[File:Queen Mother SQUARE, Poundbury, Dorset.jpg|thumb|250px|On 27 October 2017, in the Main Square of Poundbury, Prince Charles unveiled a statue in tribute to the late Queen Mother, the pedestal of which was designed by L\u00e9on Krier.]]\nHe is best known for his masterplan for, and ongoing oversight of, the development of [[Poundbury]], an urban extension to [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]], [[United Kingdom|UK]] for the [[Duchy of Cornwall]] and the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]]; and for his masterplan for Paseo Cayal\u00e1, an extension of four new urban quarters for [[Guatemala City]]. From 1976\u20132016 Krier was a visiting professor at the Universities of [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Yale University|Yale]], [[University of Virginia|Virginia]], [[Cornell University|Cornell]] and [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]].

But this is not a matter of mere hypothesis, he argues, but historical fact. The measurements and geometric organization of a city and of its quarters are not the result of mere chance or accident or simply of economic necessity, but rather represents a civilizing order which is not only aesthetic and technical but also legislative and ethical.\n\nKrier claims, that \u201cthe whole of [[Paris]] is a pre-industrial city which still works, because it is so adaptable, something the creations of the 20th century will never be. A city like [[Milton Keynes]] cannot survive an economic crisis, or any other kind of crisis, because it is planned as a mathematically determined social and economic project. If that model collapses, the city will collapse with it.\u201d Thus Krier argues not merely against the contemporary modernist city (he in fact argues that places like [[Los Angeles]], [[United States|U.S.]], are not cities), but against a gigantism tendency in urban growth, evident in the exploding scale of urban networks and buildings in European cities throughout the 19th century which was a result of the concentration of economic, political and cultural power.<ref>Leon Krier, \u201cUrban Components\u201d, ''Architectural Design'', vol. 54, no 7/8, 1984, p.43</ref> In response to this, Krier proposed the reconstruction of the European city, based on polycentric settlement models which are dictated not by machine scale but by human scale both horizontally and vertically, of self-sufficient mixed use quarters not exceeding {{convert|33|ha|acre}} (able to be crossed in 10 minutes walk) of building heights of 3 to 5 floors or 100 steps (able to be walked up comfortably) and which are limited not by mere administrative borders but by walkable, ridable, drivable boulevards, tracks, park ways. Cities then grow by the multiplication of independent urban quarters, not by horizontal or vertical over-extensions of established urban cores.\n\n== On the development of the city ==\n[[File:Diagram of a truly urban town RES PUBLICA+RES PRIVATE.jpg|thumb|'''Diagram of a truly urban town RES PUBLICA+RES PRIVATE''']]\nKrier has written a number of essays \u2212 many first published in the journal ''[[Architectural Design]]'', against modernist town planning and its principle of dividing up the city into a system of single use zones (housing, shopping, industry, leisure, etc.), as well as the resultant suburbia, commuting, etc. Indeed, Krier sees the modernist planner as a tyrannical figure that imposes detrimental megastructural scale more dictated by ideology than necessity.<ref>Leon Krier; 'Houses, Palaces, Cities', ''Architectural Design'', London, 54, 7/8, 1984.</ref>\n\nKrier summons up his criticisms and pinpoints concepts in the form of series of drawings and didactic annotated diagrams, often in his own handwriting, eventually collected in his book ''[http://mitp-content-server.mit.edu:18180/books/content/sectbyfn?collid=books_pres_0&id=7859&fn=9780262512930_sch_0001.pdf Drawings for Architecture]'', like the concept of Urban in his 1983 diagram of a truly urban town= RES PUBLICA+RES PRIVATE. There he conceives the basic urban fabric, made of private buildings and uses, as an object of vernacular local design and the exceptional public and institutional buildings as objects of classical architecture and located in privileged sites, on squares and in the focus of major vistas.<br />\n\n== On architecture and the city ==\n[[File:WINDSOR-VILLAGE HALL 1997.tiff|thumb|''Village Hall'', [[Windsor, Indian River County, Florida|Windsor, Florida]], 1997, by L\u00e9on Krier]]\nThe principle behind Krier\u2019s writings has been to explain the rational foundations of architecture and the city, stating that \u201cIn the language of symbols, there can exist no misunderstanding\u201d. That is to say, for Krier, buildings have a rational order and type: a house, a palace, a temple, a campanile, a church; but also a roof, a column, a window, etc., what he terms \u201cnameable objects\u201d. As projects get bigger, he goes on to argue, the buildings should not get bigger, but divide up; thus, for instance, in his unrealized scheme for a school in [[Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines]] (1978), France, the school became a \u201ccity in miniature\u201d. \n\nKrier proposes functional programs greatly varied within each block and plot. For him the building\u2019s design should always be typologically or tectonically justified and the variety of building types and volumes should reflect this functional variety in an evident and natural way; in short all gratuitous uniformity or gratuitous variety should be avoided designing neighboring building lots of dimensional, functional and thus formal variety and in such a way as to generate networks of public spaces consisting of public streets, squares, avenues, boulevards, parks. For Krier it is essential to compose at once the harmony of the urban blocks and of the inseparable public spaces generated between them.\n\nIn searching for such a typological architecture, Krier\u2019s work has been termed \u201can architecture without a style\u201d. However, it has also been pointed out that the appearance of his architecture is very much like [[Roman architecture]], which he then places in all his projects, be it central London, Stockholm, Tenerife or Florida.\u201d<ref>Charles Jencks, \u201cPost-Modernism and Eclectic Continuity\u201d, ''Architectural Design'', vol. 57, no 1/2, 1987, 25</ref>\n\n===A selection of manifesto texts by Krier===\nMany of these are available online<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://zeta.math.utsa.edu/~yxk833/KRIER/krierpublications.html|title=Leon Krier -- Selected Publications|website=zeta.math.utsa.edu}}</ref>\n\n*The idea of reconstruction\n*Critique of zoning\n*Town and country\n*Critique of the megastructural city\n*Critique of industrialization\n*Urban components\n*The city within the city \u2013 Les Quartiers\n*The size of a city\n*Critique of Modernisms\n*Organic versus mechanical composition\n*Names and nicknames\n*Building and architecture\n*The reconstruction of the European city\n*What is an urban quartier?

After four years working for Stirling, interrupted by a two years association with [[Josef Paul Kleihues]] in Berlin, Krier spent 20 years in England practicing and teaching at the [[Architectural Association]] and [[Royal College of Art]]. In this period, Krier's statement: \u201cI am an architect, because I don\u2019t build\u201d,<ref>Ian Latham, \"L\u00e9on Krier. A Profile....\", ''Architectural Design'', vol. 57, no 1/2, 1987, p.37</ref> became a famous expression of his uncompromising anti-modernist attitude. From the late 1970s onwards he has been one of the most influential modern traditional architects and planners. He is one of the first and most prominent critics of architectural modernism, mainly of its functional zoning and the ensuing suburbanism, campaigning for the reconstruction of the traditional European city model and its growth based on the polycentric city model.\n\nHis ideas had a great influence on the [[New Urbanism]] movement, both in the USA and Europe. The most complete compilation of them is published in his book [http://www.placemakers.com/2009/05/08/what-were-reading-leon-kriers-architecture-of-community/ ''The Architecture of Community''.]\n\n[[File:Queen Mother SQUARE, Poundbury, Dorset.jpg|thumb|200px|On 27 October 2017, in the Main Square of Poundbury, Prince Charles unveiled a statue in tribute to the late Queen Mother, the pedestal of which was designed by L\u00e9on Krier.]]\nHe is best known for his masterplan for, and ongoing oversight of, the development of [[Poundbury]], an urban extension to [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]], [[United Kingdom|UK]] for the [[Duchy of Cornwall]] and the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]]; and for his masterplan for Paseo Cayal\u00e1, an extension of four new urban quarters for [[Guatemala City]].

As projects get bigger, he goes on to argue, the buildings should not get bigger, but divide up; thus, for instance, in his unrealized scheme for a school in [[Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines]] (1978), France, the school became a \u201ccity in miniature\u201d. \n\nKrier proposes functional programs greatly varied within each block and plot. For him the building\u2019s design should always be typologically or tectonically justified and the variety of building types and volumes should reflect this functional variety in an evident and natural way; in short all gratuitous uniformity or gratuitous variety should be avoided designing neighboring building lots of dimensional, functional and thus formal variety and in such a way as to generate networks of public spaces consisting of public streets, squares, avenues, boulevards, parks. For Krier it is essential to compose at once the harmony of the urban blocks and of the inseparable public spaces generated between them.\n\nIn searching for such a typological architecture, Krier\u2019s work has been termed \u201can architecture without a style\u201d. However, it has also been pointed out that the appearance of his architecture is very much like [[Roman architecture]], which he then places in all his projects, be it central London, Stockholm, Tenerife or Florida.\u201d<ref>Charles Jencks, \u201cPost-Modernism and Eclectic Continuity\u201d, ''Architectural Design'', vol. 57, no 1/2, 1987, 25</ref>\n\n===A selection of manifesto texts by Krier===\nMany of these are available online<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://zeta.math.utsa.edu/~yxk833/KRIER/krierpublications.html|title=Leon Krier -- Selected Publications|website=zeta.math.utsa.edu}}</ref>\n\n*The idea of reconstruction\n*Critique of zoning\n*Town and country\n*Critique of the megastructural city\n*Critique of industrialization\n*Urban components\n*The city within the city \u2013 Les Quartiers\n*The size of a city\n*Critique of Modernisms\n*Organic versus mechanical composition\n*Names and nicknames\n*Building and architecture\n*The reconstruction of the European city\n*What is an urban quartier?

On November 15, 2009 at 9:15&nbsp;a.m., the first flight from Terminal D (the new official name of Sheremetyevo-3) departed for the southern resort city of Sochi.

The terminal was designed to service 6 million passengers per year. Until the completion of the original Terminal C, it was the only terminal that serviced international flights. The design is a larger version of the one of [[Hannover-Langenhagen Airport]] by the same architects. A major reconstruction of the terminal and its interior space was completed by late 2009. For the convenience of passengers, the departures lounge and Duty Free zone were thoroughly modernised, whilst a number of partition walls were removed to create extra retail and lounge space.\n\nIt was announced that terminal F will be re-constructed after the construction of terminal C is completed.\n\n==== Terminal G ====\nIn November 2019 it was announced, that a new Terminal G will also be built. Construction is planned for 2024<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aviation24.be/airports/moscow-sheremetyevo-svo/aeroflot-transfers-its-international-flights-to-new-sheremetyevo-terminal-from-january-2020/ |title=Aeroflot transfers its international flights to new Sheremetyevo terminal from January 2020 |newspaper= aviation24.be|date= 26 Nov 2019}}</ref>\n<br />\n{{clear}}\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\nThe following airlines serve the following destinations at Sheremetyevo International Airport.<ref name=\"svo.aero\"/><!-- WHEN ADDING A NEW ROUTE, OR ADDING AN END DATE FOR A ROUTE PLEASE ADD A REFERENCE, ALSO ADD THE ROUTE AND LINK ON THE CORRESPONDING AIRPORTS ARTICLE AND THE AIRLINES ARTICLE IF IT IS A NEW DESTINATION, ANYTHING WHICH IS NOT REFERENCED WILL BE REMOVED.

The acquisition of its own terminal was a condition of Aeroflot's entry into the SkyTeam airline alliance, thus necessitating the construction. The main contractor for the build was a Turkish company Enka. Terminal D has 22 jetways and 11 remote stands. On November 15, 2009 at 9:15&nbsp;a.m., the first flight from Terminal D (the new official name of Sheremetyevo-3) departed for the southern resort city of Sochi. Despite this, Aeroflot took a number of months (due to unexpected administrative delays) to transfer all of its international flights from Terminal F to D (a full transfer was originally planned for February 2010).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.russia-ic.com/news/show/9575/|title=Transfer of international flights to the Sheremetyevo Terminal D delayed once more :: Russia-InfoCentre|publisher=|accessdate=2 June 2015}}</ref> Whilst previously Terminal D had remained a separate legal entity from the rest of Sheremetyevo Airport, in spring 2012, it became an integrated unit of \"Sheremetyevo International Airport\" JSC. As part of the deal, Aeroflot, VEB Bank, and VTB Bank, all of which had invested in the construction of Terminal D, became part shareholders in the airport as a whole. The basis for the architectural and artistic image of Terminal D is that of a giant [[swan]] with outstretched wings.\n[[File:SVO Terminal D inside 01.jpg|thumb|Interior of Terminal D]]\nThere is an official multi-storey parking at Terminal D connected with the main building by means of a pedestrian bridge.

The terminals of this complex are connected by a number of pedestrian walkways with travelators, thus allowing for passengers to move freely between its constituent facilities. In December 2010, a new chapel dedicated to St. Nicholas opened on the second floor of Terminal E. The terminal is used for international flights, primarily by Aeroflot and its SkyTeam partners. Terminal E has 8 jetway equipped gates.

The gold medal was then awarded to the original silver medalist Lewis, who had run 9.92. On 30 September 1989, following Johnson's admission to steroid use between 1981 and 1988, the IAAF rescinded his world record of 9.83 from the 1987 World Championship Final and stripped Johnson of his World Championship gold medal, which was also awarded to Lewis, who initially finished second.\n\nAccordingly, Lewis's 9.92 from the Olympic Final was also recognized as the official world record, breaking the 9.93 mark that [[Calvin Smith]] had set in 1983 and Lewis had since equalled twice. Smith also participated in this race and originally finished fourth, but was elevated to third place and awarded the bronze medal, and [[Linford Christie]] of the United Kingdom, who originally won the bronze medal, was elevated to silver.\n\nThe other participants in this race, in order of finish, were [[Dennis Mitchell]] of the United States, who would go on to win the bronze medal in this event in [[Athletics at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Barcelona]]; [[Robson da Silva]] of Brazil, who won bronze in the [[Athletics at the 1988 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 200 meters|200 meters]] in Seoul; Johnson's teammate [[Desai Williams]], a bronze medalist in the 4 x 100 meter relay in [[Athletics at the 1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles]] four years earlier; and [[Ray Stewart (athlete)|Ray Stewart]] of [[Jamaica]], who won a silver medal in the same relay at the Los Angeles Olympics.<ref name=\"SR\">{{cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1988/ATH/mens-100-metres.html |title=Athletics at the 1988 Seoul Summer Games: Men's 100 metres |accessdate=6 July 2017 |work=Sports Reference}}</ref>\n\nIt would take eleven years for an athlete to run a \"clean\" 9.79 in the 100 meters, which was accomplished by [[Maurice Greene (athlete)|Maurice Greene]] in [[Athens, Greece]] in 1999.\n\n==Aftermath==\nJohnson was not the only participant whose success was questioned: Lewis had tested positive at the [[United States Olympic Trials (track and field)|Olympic Trials]] for [[pseudoephedrine]], [[ephedrine]] and [[phenylpropanolamine]].

The gold medal was then awarded to the original silver medalist Lewis, who had run 9.92. On 30 September 1989, following Johnson's admission to steroid use between 1981 and 1988, the IAAF rescinded his world record of 9.83 from the 1987 World Championship Final and stripped Johnson of his World Championship gold medal, which was also awarded to Lewis, who initially finished second.\n\nAccordingly, Lewis's 9.92 from the Olympic Final was also recognized as the official world record, breaking the 9.93 mark that [[Calvin Smith]] had set in 1983 and Lewis had since equalled twice. Smith also participated in this race and originally finished fourth, but was elevated to third place and awarded the bronze medal, and [[Linford Christie]] of the United Kingdom, who originally won the bronze medal, was elevated to silver.\n\nThe other participants in this race, in order of finish, were [[Dennis Mitchell]] of the United States, who would go on to win the bronze medal in this event in [[Athletics at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Barcelona]]; [[Robson da Silva]] of Brazil, who won bronze in the [[Athletics at the 1988 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 200 meters|200 meters]] in Seoul; Johnson's teammate [[Desai Williams]], a bronze medalist in the 4 x 100 meter relay in [[Athletics at the 1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles]] four years earlier; and [[Ray Stewart (athlete)|Ray Stewart]] of [[Jamaica]], who won a silver medal in the same relay at the Los Angeles Olympics.<ref name=\"SR\">{{cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1988/ATH/mens-100-metres.html |title=Athletics at the 1988 Seoul Summer Games: Men's 100 metres |accessdate=6 July 2017 |work=Sports Reference}}</ref>\n\nIt would take eleven years for an athlete to run a \"clean\" 9.79 in the 100 meters, which was accomplished by [[Maurice Greene (athlete)|Maurice Greene]] in [[Athens, Greece]] in 1999.\n\n==Aftermath==\nJohnson was not the only participant whose success was questioned: Lewis had tested positive at the [[United States Olympic Trials (track and field)|Olympic Trials]] for [[pseudoephedrine]], [[ephedrine]] and [[phenylpropanolamine]]. Lewis defended himself, claiming that he had accidentally consumed the banned substances. After the supplements that he had taken were analyzed to prove his claims, the USOC accepted his claim of inadvertent use, since a dietary supplement he ingested was found to contain \"Ma huang\", the Chinese name for [[Ephedra]] (ephedrine is known to help weight loss).<ref name=\":0\" /> Fellow [[Santa Monica Track Club]] teammates [[Joe DeLoach]] and [[Floyd Heard]] were also found to have the same banned stimulants in their systems, and were cleared to compete for the same reason.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/si_online/scorecard/news/2003/04/15/sc/ |title=Scorecard |publisher=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=October 10, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/17/1050172709693.html |title=Carl Lewis's positive test covered up |publisher=Smh.com.au |date=April 18, 2003 |accessdate=April 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe highest level of the stimulants Lewis recorded was 6 ppm, which was regarded as a positive test in 1988 but is now regarded as negative test.

The airport has flights to European metropolitan and leisure destinations, and serves as a base for [[Eurowings]], [[Condor Flugdienst|Condor]], [[SunExpress Deutschland]] and [[TUI fly Deutschland]].\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\n[[File:Flughafen Hannover 1970.jpg|thumb|Hannover Airport in 1970]]\nHannover Airport was opened in Langenhagen in 1952, replacing an old airfield within the city limits of Hannover. In 1973 two modern terminals were opened, which became famous because of their compact design. They became the archetype for the [[Sheremetyevo International Airport]] in Moscow. These terminals A and B are still in service today.\n\nIn the 1990s, trials of intercontinental services to the United States and Canada were stopped due to low passenger numbers.\n\nIn 1998, the largest terminal, C, was opened to handle more passengers, adding 8 more boarding gates and 3 bus departure gates. Up to 33 aircraft can be handled simultaneously, of which 20 can use aircraft stands equipped with a [[Jetway]]. All three terminals are capable of handling a [[Boeing 747]].\n\nFrom 1957 to 1990, the airport hosted the ''[[Internationale Luft- und Raumfahrtausstellung]]'', Germany's largest [[air show]]. After a fatal accident in 1988, when a [[Royal Air Force]] [[Boeing Chinook (UK variants)|Chinook helicopter]] hit a [[Jetway]] with its rotor, and [[German Reunification]] two years later, the air show moved to [[Berlin]] in 1992.\n\n===Development since the 2000s===\nIn 2000, an [[Hanover S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] connection was established between the airport and [[Hamelin]] via [[Hanover Hauptbahnhof|Hannover Central Station]]. This replaced the airport's shuttle bus service which ran every 20 minutes, more frequently than the S-Bahn, but took longer to reach the airport and railway station. The train service was extended to [[Paderborn]] in 2003.\n\n[[TUIfly]], which maintains a base at Hannover Airport, dramatically reduced services in 2008 and 2009, and passed all its non-traditional holiday routes to [[Air Berlin]] late in 2009. In 2010 [[Germanwings]], a subsidiary of [[Lufthansa]], opened their sixth base at Hannover.<ref name=\"anna.aero\">\n{{cite web\n|author=anna.aero\n|title=Germanwings' new Hanover base launches with 16 routes; half of 75 weekly flights target the Air Berlin monopoly routes\n|date=5 May 2010\n|url=http://www.anna.aero/2010/05/05/germanwings-new-hannover-base-launches-with-16-routes/\n|publisher=anna.aero Airline News & Analysis\n}}\n</ref> In 2017, now defunct airline Air Berlin fully reduced the flight program and operated its last flight from Hannover in March 2017.\n\nHannover Airport has struggled to generate increased demand in recent years, possibly due to a reluctance or inability to attract Europe's low-cost carriers to serve the airport. New routes from network carriers to their hubs were opened and closed after one season/year due to low demand (e.g., Aer Lingus, Air Baltic, TAP Air Portugal). Although traffic grew satisfactorily during the late 1990s, during the last decade there has been little growth. In both 2007 and 2008, traffic was down less than 1%, but in 2009 it fell by almost 12%.<ref name=\"anna.aero\" /> Hannover Airport is one of very few German airports which are open 24 hours a day, but there are very few flights between 23:00 and 04:00.\n\nAccording to local press plans to restart scheduled long haul operation with a connection to Iran are currently under investigation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haz.de/Hannover/Aus-der-Stadt/Uebersicht/Absichtserklaerung-von-Tuifly-Bald-Direktfluege-von-Hannover-in-den-Iran|title=Tuifly to offer flights to Iran|accessdate=7 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe General Aviation Terminal, located near the center runway, was renamed ''Karl Jatho Terminal'' in honour of Hanoverian aviation pioneer [[Karl Jatho]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hannover-airport.de/index.php?id=1498&L=1|title=Hanover Airport: Fluginformationen: Hannover Airport: Fluginformationen: Karl Jatho|accessdate=4 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040014/http://www.hannover-airport.de/index.php?id=1498&L=1|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Terminal==\nHannover Airport has three passenger terminal concourses named ''Terminals A, B'', and ''C''.

The [[List of airports in Germany|ninth largest airport in Germany]], it is in [[Langenhagen]], {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Hannover. The airport has flights to European metropolitan and leisure destinations, and serves as a base for [[Eurowings]], [[Condor Flugdienst|Condor]], [[SunExpress Deutschland]] and [[TUI fly Deutschland]].\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\n[[File:Flughafen Hannover 1970.jpg|thumb|Hannover Airport in 1970]]\nHannover Airport was opened in Langenhagen in 1952, replacing an old airfield within the city limits of Hannover. In 1973 two modern terminals were opened, which became famous because of their compact design. They became the archetype for the [[Sheremetyevo International Airport]] in Moscow. These terminals A and B are still in service today.\n\nIn the 1990s, trials of intercontinental services to the United States and Canada were stopped due to low passenger numbers.\n\nIn 1998, the largest terminal, C, was opened to handle more passengers, adding 8 more boarding gates and 3 bus departure gates. Up to 33 aircraft can be handled simultaneously, of which 20 can use aircraft stands equipped with a [[Jetway]]. All three terminals are capable of handling a [[Boeing 747]].\n\nFrom 1957 to 1990, the airport hosted the ''[[Internationale Luft- und Raumfahrtausstellung]]'', Germany's largest [[air show]]. After a fatal accident in 1988, when a [[Royal Air Force]] [[Boeing Chinook (UK variants)|Chinook helicopter]] hit a [[Jetway]] with its rotor, and [[German Reunification]] two years later, the air show moved to [[Berlin]] in 1992.\n\n===Development since the 2000s===\nIn 2000, an [[Hanover S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] connection was established between the airport and [[Hamelin]] via [[Hanover Hauptbahnhof|Hannover Central Station]]. This replaced the airport's shuttle bus service which ran every 20 minutes, more frequently than the S-Bahn, but took longer to reach the airport and railway station. The train service was extended to [[Paderborn]] in 2003.\n\n[[TUIfly]], which maintains a base at Hannover Airport, dramatically reduced services in 2008 and 2009, and passed all its non-traditional holiday routes to [[Air Berlin]] late in 2009. In 2010 [[Germanwings]], a subsidiary of [[Lufthansa]], opened their sixth base at Hannover.<ref name=\"anna.aero\">\n{{cite web\n|author=anna.aero\n|title=Germanwings' new Hanover base launches with 16 routes; half of 75 weekly flights target the Air Berlin monopoly routes\n|date=5 May 2010\n|url=http://www.anna.aero/2010/05/05/germanwings-new-hannover-base-launches-with-16-routes/\n|publisher=anna.aero Airline News & Analysis\n}}\n</ref> In 2017, now defunct airline Air Berlin fully reduced the flight program and operated its last flight from Hannover in March 2017.\n\nHannover Airport has struggled to generate increased demand in recent years, possibly due to a reluctance or inability to attract Europe's low-cost carriers to serve the airport. New routes from network carriers to their hubs were opened and closed after one season/year due to low demand (e.g., Aer Lingus, Air Baltic, TAP Air Portugal). Although traffic grew satisfactorily during the late 1990s, during the last decade there has been little growth. In both 2007 and 2008, traffic was down less than 1%, but in 2009 it fell by almost 12%.<ref name=\"anna.aero\" /> Hannover Airport is one of very few German airports which are open 24 hours a day, but there are very few flights between 23:00 and 04:00.\n\nAccording to local press plans to restart scheduled long haul operation with a connection to Iran are currently under investigation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haz.de/Hannover/Aus-der-Stadt/Uebersicht/Absichtserklaerung-von-Tuifly-Bald-Direktfluege-von-Hannover-in-den-Iran|title=Tuifly to offer flights to Iran|accessdate=7 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe General Aviation Terminal, located near the center runway, was renamed ''Karl Jatho Terminal'' in honour of Hanoverian aviation pioneer [[Karl Jatho]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hannover-airport.de/index.php?id=1498&L=1|title=Hanover Airport: Fluginformationen: Hannover Airport: Fluginformationen: Karl Jatho|accessdate=4 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040014/http://www.hannover-airport.de/index.php?id=1498&L=1|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Terminal==\nHannover Airport has three passenger terminal concourses named ''Terminals A, B'', and ''C''.
