Schofield]], who made his own modifications to the Model 3 to meet his perceptions of the Cavalry's needs. Smith & Wesson incorporated these modifications into an 1875 design they named after the Major, planning to obtain significant military contracts for the new revolver.<ref name=boorman/>\n\nThe S&W Model 3 was originally chambered for the [[.44 S&W American]] and [[.44 Russian]] cartridges, and typically did not have the cartridge information stamped on the gun (as is standard practice for most commercial firearms). Model 3 revolvers were later produced in an assortment of calibers, including [[.44 Henry]] Rimfire, [[.44-40]], .32-44, .38-44, and [[.45 Schofield]]. The design would influence the smaller [[S&W .38 Single Action]] that is retroactively referred to as the Model 2.<ref name=boorman/>\n\n==Russian Model==\n[[File:George Amstrong Custer with Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovitch.jpeg|thumb|George Amstrong Custer with Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovitch after the Duke Buffalo Hunt; the Duke with his new Smith & Wesson No. 3 in the holster]]\n[[File:S&W Auswerfer.jpg|thumb|Smith & Wesson No. 3, open for loading.

The first was the 1st Model Russian (the original order design), with the Russian Ordnance Inspector mandating a number of improvements to the design, resulting in the 2nd Model Russian, with a final revision to the Russian design being known as the 3rd Model Russian.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\">{{cite book|last1=Supica|first1=Jim|last2=Nahas|first2=Richard|title=Standard Catalog of Smith & Wesson|date=3 January 2007|publisher=F+W Media |location=Iola, Wisconsin |isbn=0-89689-293-X|pages=88\u2013103}}</ref>\n\nSmith & Wesson nearly went bankrupt as a result of their Russian contract production, as the imperial government assigned a number of engineers and gunsmiths to [[reverse-engineer]] the Smith & Wesson design, and then began to produce copies of the revolver\u2014both in their own arsenal at [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] and by contracting other manufacturers in Germany and elsewhere in Europe to manufacture copies of the revolver (a common practice at the time\u2014Webley & Scott's [[British Bulldog revolver]] was widely copied, too, by European and American gunsmiths).<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nThe Russian and European copies of the S&W Model 3 revolver were generally of very high quality, but considerably cheaper than the S&W produced revolvers. This led to the imperial government cancelling the order for significant quantities of Smith & Wesson\u2013made revolvers (which Smith & Wesson had already produced), and delaying (or refusing) payment for the handguns that had already been delivered.<ref name=S&W>Lawman, Tuolumne [http://www.sam-hane.com/sass/schofield/history.htm \"Smith & Wesson's #3, Colt's Biggest Rival in the Old West\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228033351/http://www.sam-hane.com/sass/schofield/history.htm |date=2008-02-28 }}. Sam Hane's Western History.</ref>\n\n==Schofield Revolver==\nThe U.S. Army adopted the [[.44 S&W American]] caliber Smith & Wesson Model 3 revolver in 1870, making the Model 3 revolver the first standard-issue cartridge-firing revolver in US service. Most military pistols until that point were [[Gunpowder|black powder]] cap and ball revolvers, which were (by comparison) slow, complicated, and susceptible to the effects of wet weather.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n[[File:S&W Schofield Model.jpg|thumb|S&W Schofield]]\nIn 1875, the US Ordnance Board granted Smith & Wesson a contract to outfit the military with Model 3 revolvers incorporating the design improvements of Major George W. Schofield (known as the \"Schofield revolver\"), providing that they could make the revolvers fire the .45 [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] (AKA \"[[.45 Long Colt]]\") ammunition already in use by the US military. Smith & Wesson instead developed their own, slightly shorter .45 caliber round, the [[.45 Schofield]], otherwise known as the .45 S&W.<ref name=\"Kinard2004\">{{cite book|last=Kinard|first=Jeff|title=Pistols: An Illustrated History of Their Impact|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZVnuHX_6bG0C&pg=PA129|year=2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-470-7|pages=129\u2013135}}</ref>\n\nWhen it became obvious in the field that the two cartridges would not work interchangeably in the Schofield (although they both worked in the Colt), the U.S. Government adopted the shorter .45 Schofield cartridge as the standard cartridge. Despite the change, old stocks of the longer .45 Colt rounds in the supply line caused the Army to drop most of the Schofields and continue with the Colt. Major Schofield had patented his locking system and earned a payment on each gun that Smith & Wesson sold, and at the time his older brother, [[John M. Schofield]], was the head of the Army Ordnance Board and the political situation may have been the main issue for the early end of army sales.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nMany of the S&W Model 3 Schofield revolvers saw service in the [[Indian Wars]], and there are reports of them in use as late as the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] and [[Philippine\u2013American War]]. Like the other Smith & Wesson Model 3s, they were also reportedly popular with lawmen and outlaws in the American West, and were reportedly used by [[Jesse James]], [[Robert Ford (outlaw)|Bob Ford]] (who used one to kill James),<ref name=\"Agnew2012\">{{cite book|last=Agnew|first=Jeremy|title=The Old West in Fact and Film: History Versus Hollywood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R_mRcTRYcvsC&pg=PA150|date=1 November 2012|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-9311-1|page=150}}</ref> [[John Wesley Hardin]], [[Pat Garrett]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Virgil Earp]], [[Billy the Kid]], and many others. The Smith & Wesson No. 3 revolver was famously used by [[Wyatt Earp]] during the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral|OK Corral Gunfight]] with the [[Ike Clanton|Clanton Gang]].<ref name=boorman/>\n\nWhile the standard barrel length was 7\", many Schofields were purchased as surplus by distributors, and had the barrels shortened to 5\", and were refinished in nickel.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/> After the Spanish\u2013American War of 1898, the US Army sold off all their surplus Schofield revolvers. The surplus Schofield revolvers were reconditioned by wholesalers and gunsmiths (at professional factory-quality level) with a considerable number offered for sale on the commercial market with a 5-inch barrel as well as the standard size barrel of 7 inches.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nOf the most notable purchasers of these reconditioned model 3 Schofield revolvers was [[Wells Fargo and Company]], who purchased the revolvers for use by Wells Fargo Road Agents and had the barrels shortened to a more concealable 5 inches length. These revolvers were then inspected by the Wells Fargo armorer and uniquely stamped \"W.F. & Co\" or \"Wells Fargo & Co\", along with the original Smith & Wesson serial number re-stamped alongside the Wells Fargo stamping on the flat part of the barrel just forward of the barrel pivot as well as re-stamping any part of each revolver which had not originally been stamped or stamped in a location that would be difficult to view the serial number, when needed.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nThe Wells Fargo Schofield revolvers became so popular with collectors from the 1970s onwards that the unique Wells Fargo markings were being \"counterfeited\" or \"faked\" by unscrupulous sellers to enhance the value of other similar versions that had not been genuinely owned by Wells Fargo & Co.  There are more \"fake\" Wells Fargo marked Schofield revolvers than genuine ones in existence and, accordingly, a collector interested in purchasing a \"Wells Fargo\" Schofield revolver would be well advised to have a pre-purchase inspection and verification performed by an expert who specializes in this model.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nLieutenant Colonel Schofield shot himself on December 17, 1882, with a S&W Schofield revolver after suffering a bout of mental illness, stress and isolation.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Springfield Armory Museum|title=REVOLVER -  SMITH & WESSON REVOLVER MODEL 3 SCHOFIELD FIRST MODEL SINGLE ACTION .45 SN# 1532|url= http://ww2.rediscov.com/spring/VFPCGI.exe?IDCFile=/spring/DETAILS.IDC,SPECIFIC=9823,DATABASE=objects}}</ref>\n\nAn engraved, gold-plated New Model Number 3 with pearl grips was presented to sharpshooter [[Annie Oakley]] in the 1890s by her husband Frank Butler.

In the previous engineering, the posts of the frame would wear out after heavy usage.  Schofield's improvement called for heat treated, replaceable components at this sensitive \"wear\" area of the catch and latch. The serial number range also will give an indication of whether it is First or Second Model, with the serial numbers changing from the First Model to the Second Model at a little over 3,000.<ref name=S&W />\n\n====New Model Number 3====\n[[File:S & W 3rd New Model.jpg|thumb|Smith & Wesson No. 3, New Model, 44 Russian]]\nIn 1877, S&W discontinued production of its other Model 3s such as the American, Russian, and Schofield\u2014in favor a new improved design called the New Model Number Three. This new model has a longer cylinder allowing it to fire longer cartridges. Standard chambering was .44 Russian, although other calibers were offered on special order or in related models such as the .44-40 Frontier Model, the .32-44 & .38-44 Target Models, and the very rare .38-40 Winchester Model.<ref name=S&W />\n\n====Australian Model====\nIn 1880 the [[South Australia Police]], who were then interested in re-arming with up-to-date weapons, noted a display of New Model Number Three revolvers at the [[Australian Exposition]] in [[Melbourne]].  At the direction of [[William John Peterswald|Police Commissioner Peterswald]] an order was placed through S&W's New York agent for 250 nickel revolvers in [[.44 Russian]] with a seven-inch barrel length. The order, which included extension shoulder stocks, ammunition, and reloading kits, arrived at [[Adelaide]] in March 1882.  The revolvers and stocks were thereupon marked with a government [[Broad arrow#Use in Australia|broad arrow punch mark]], and were called [[revolver-carbines]].  They were issued to [[mounted police]], known as troopers, who at that period also policed the [[Northern Territory]].  Both the South Australia and [[Western Australia]] police made further small purchases during 1886-88, none of which was marked with the broad arrow.  For some thirty years the revolver-carbine was the front line weapon of the mounted police of S.A., W.A., and N.T.  Nearly all serial numbers are known, and are listed in the book ''Service Arms of the South Australian Police''.<ref>''Service Arms of the South Australian Police : 1838 to 1988, the first 150 years'' by Max Slee : (Antique & Historical Arms Assoc., of South Australia, Adelaide, 1988) {{ISBN|0-7316-4078-0}}:</ref> The S.A. revolvers were sold as surplus in 1953 to the Western Arms Corporation of [[Los Angeles]].\n\n====Smith & Wesson .44 Double Action First Model====\n[[File:S&W 44 DA Frontier.jpg|thumb|Smith & Wesson .44 Double Action Frontier]]\n\nThe Smith & Wesson .44 Double Action Frontier Revolver was made from 1881 to 1898. This revolver could be fired in both single- and [[Trigger (firearms)#Double-action|double action]], and used the typical S&W top-break ejection system. Chambered primarily in [[.44 Russian]], as well as [[.44 S&W American]] and [[.44-40]] it incorporated the company's familiar curved grip frame, with hard rubber or checkered walnut grips. It was available in blue and nickel-plated finishes, with 4, 5, 6, 6\u00bd and 8 inch barrels (the 5\" being the most common).\n<ref>https://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/2013/4/23/smith-wesson-44-double-action-first-model/</ref>\n\n==Copies==\nThe popular Model 3 was copied in many countries. Most common were the versions made in Spain, Mexico and Belgium; but companies such as [[Ludwig Loewe & Company]] of Germany and the [[Tula Arsenal]] in Russia played a hand in the counterfeit game, too. Copies have been found in Turkey and Pakistan as well, made by local manufacturers.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\n===11mm Orbea Hermanos y Cia. M1884 ''Sistema ON\u00c1'' (\"S&W Model 7\")===\n[[File:Rev\u00f3lver Orbea.jpg|thumb|An Orbea Hermanos revolver at the Seville Military History Museum.]]\n\nIn 1884 the Spanish government made a decree stating that any invention not copyrighted by their copyright office was not under their protection. One victim of this was Smith & Wesson, whose lucrative contract to produce Model 3 revolvers for the Spanish Army was quickly cancelled. Its work given to local gunsmiths in Eibar by different firms without any standardization of parts.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nThe [[Orbea|Orbea Hermanos]] ''Modelo 1884 Sistema ON\u00c1'' ([[Basque language|Basque]] ''on\u00e1'' > \"good\") or \"S&W Model 7\" revolver was made from 1884 until the 1920s. It is notable for its grip medallion, which is an \"OH\" interlaced like the Smith & Wesson \"S&W\".<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nAn interesting footnote is that Smith & Wesson immediately copyrighted all of their other designs in Spain from then on. That is why their firearms have MARCA REGISTRADA and the date of the Spanish patent on their barrels.<ref name=\"Lee2016\">{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Jerry|title=2016 Standard Catalog of Firearms: The Collector's Price and Reference Guide|date=29 January 2016|publisher=\"F+W Media, Inc.\"|isbn=978-1-4402-4441-4|page=1034}}</ref>\n\n===Liege copies===\nThere were a number of unauthorized Belgian copies made in [[.44 Russian]] and [[.44-40 Winchester]] as Single and Double Action revolvers. These copies, mostly manufactured in Liege, were marked as if to deceive a buyer into thinking that they were a revolver produced by Smith & Wesson. Many of the finer details such as the location of the Smith & Wesson factory were incorrectly stamped on the revolvers (\"New York\" and \"VK\" being the two most common).<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nSmith & Wesson brought lawsuits against two gunmakers in Liege, which they originally lost, but won on appeal.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\n===Users===\n====Italy====\nThe prime contractor for the Italian military was Orbea, which chambered their revolvers for the Italian [[:it:10,35 x 20 mm|10.4mm cartridge]].  These Spanish-made revolvers were used during World War I, and according to online sources were the preferred handgun of elite [[Arditi]] troops.\n\n====Philippines====\nMany Spanish firearms were captured by the [[Philippine Revolutionary Army|Liberation Army]] during the [[Philippine Revolution|Revolution]], among them Model 1884 revolvers. Some were brought by defectors from the Spanish military.  These handguns also saw service, later, in the [[Philippine-American War]].\n\n====Romania====\nRevolvers for the Romanian military were chambered for the .44 Russian cartridge, and were made by Trocaola, Aranzabal y C\u00eda.  These Spanish-made revolvers were used during World War I.\n\n====Spain====\nSpain used these revolvers, which were chambered for the .44 Russian cartridge, during the Philippine Revolution, the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], the [[Rif War]], and the [[Spanish Civil War]].\n\n====United Kingdom====\nThe ''M1884'' was later briefly made chambered in .455 Webley for British government contracts in 1915 and 1916. It was designated by the British Army as the \"Pistol, Old Pattern\", due to its old design. They were dubbed \"Spanish Webleys\" by troops even though they were copies of the S&W Model 3. Orbea Hermanos y Cia., [[:es:G.A.C.|Garate, Anitua y Cia.]], and Trocaola, Aranzabal y Cia. were contracted to make 30,000 revolvers among them. Orbea Hermanos was the major contractor and the other two were sub-contractors. Rexach & Urgoite was later contracted in 1916 to make 500 pistols but all failed proofing and the lot was refused.\n\nFinish and quality control was varied throughout the run of production. The fact that they were making service pistols and revolvers for France and Italy at the same time was definitely a factor.\n\nAs there was no standardization of design or parts between manufacturers, each manufacturer's model was considered a different gun altogether. The Garate, Anitua y Cia. model was designated the ''Pistol, Old Pattern, No.1 Mk.I'',<ref>Taylerson-Chamberlain, W. H. J. and A. W. F. ''Revolvers of the British Services, 1854-1944'', pp. 57-59.</ref><ref>Maze, Robert J. ''Howdah to High Power \u2013 A Century of British Breechloading Service Pistols (1867-1967)'', pp. 93-94</ref> the Trocaola, Aranzabal y Cia. model was designated the ''Pistol, Old Pattern, No.2 Mk.I'', and the Orbea Hermanos model was designated the ''Pistol, Old Pattern, No.3 Mk.I''.\n\nThe weapons were given to the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] after the war. The RUC later sold them off to the [[New South Wales Police Force]], who made snub-nosed revolvers out of them and issued them as backup pistols. A cut-down snub-nosed .455 \"Old Pattern\" Revolver was carried by one of [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]]' bodyguards.\n\n==Modern reproductions==\nModern reproductions of the Smith & Wesson model 3 Revolver are made by a number of companies, including (most notably) Smith & Wesson themselves, as well as the Italian arms-makers [[A.

Smith & Wesson incorporated these modifications into an 1875 design they named after the Major, planning to obtain significant military contracts for the new revolver.<ref name=boorman/>\n\nThe S&W Model 3 was originally chambered for the [[.44 S&W American]] and [[.44 Russian]] cartridges, and typically did not have the cartridge information stamped on the gun (as is standard practice for most commercial firearms). Model 3 revolvers were later produced in an assortment of calibers, including [[.44 Henry]] Rimfire, [[.44-40]], .32-44, .38-44, and [[.45 Schofield]]. The design would influence the smaller [[S&W .38 Single Action]] that is retroactively referred to as the Model 2.<ref name=boorman/>\n\n==Russian Model==\n[[File:George Amstrong Custer with Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovitch.jpeg|thumb|George Amstrong Custer with Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovitch after the Duke Buffalo Hunt; the Duke with his new Smith & Wesson No. 3 in the holster]]\n[[File:S&W Auswerfer.jpg|thumb|Smith & Wesson No. 3, open for loading.

The first was the 1st Model Russian (the original order design), with the Russian Ordnance Inspector mandating a number of improvements to the design, resulting in the 2nd Model Russian, with a final revision to the Russian design being known as the 3rd Model Russian.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\">{{cite book|last1=Supica|first1=Jim|last2=Nahas|first2=Richard|title=Standard Catalog of Smith & Wesson|date=3 January 2007|publisher=F+W Media |location=Iola, Wisconsin |isbn=0-89689-293-X|pages=88\u2013103}}</ref>\n\nSmith & Wesson nearly went bankrupt as a result of their Russian contract production, as the imperial government assigned a number of engineers and gunsmiths to [[reverse-engineer]] the Smith & Wesson design, and then began to produce copies of the revolver\u2014both in their own arsenal at [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] and by contracting other manufacturers in Germany and elsewhere in Europe to manufacture copies of the revolver (a common practice at the time\u2014Webley & Scott's [[British Bulldog revolver]] was widely copied, too, by European and American gunsmiths).<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nThe Russian and European copies of the S&W Model 3 revolver were generally of very high quality, but considerably cheaper than the S&W produced revolvers. This led to the imperial government cancelling the order for significant quantities of Smith & Wesson\u2013made revolvers (which Smith & Wesson had already produced), and delaying (or refusing) payment for the handguns that had already been delivered.<ref name=S&W>Lawman, Tuolumne [http://www.sam-hane.com/sass/schofield/history.htm \"Smith & Wesson's #3, Colt's Biggest Rival in the Old West\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228033351/http://www.sam-hane.com/sass/schofield/history.htm |date=2008-02-28 }}. Sam Hane's Western History.</ref>\n\n==Schofield Revolver==\nThe U.S. Army adopted the [[.44 S&W American]] caliber Smith & Wesson Model 3 revolver in 1870, making the Model 3 revolver the first standard-issue cartridge-firing revolver in US service. Most military pistols until that point were [[Gunpowder|black powder]] cap and ball revolvers, which were (by comparison) slow, complicated, and susceptible to the effects of wet weather.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n[[File:S&W Schofield Model.jpg|thumb|S&W Schofield]]\nIn 1875, the US Ordnance Board granted Smith & Wesson a contract to outfit the military with Model 3 revolvers incorporating the design improvements of Major George W. Schofield (known as the \"Schofield revolver\"), providing that they could make the revolvers fire the .45 [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] (AKA \"[[.45 Long Colt]]\") ammunition already in use by the US military. Smith & Wesson instead developed their own, slightly shorter .45 caliber round, the [[.45 Schofield]], otherwise known as the .45 S&W.<ref name=\"Kinard2004\">{{cite book|last=Kinard|first=Jeff|title=Pistols: An Illustrated History of Their Impact|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZVnuHX_6bG0C&pg=PA129|year=2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-470-7|pages=129\u2013135}}</ref>\n\nWhen it became obvious in the field that the two cartridges would not work interchangeably in the Schofield (although they both worked in the Colt), the U.S. Government adopted the shorter .45 Schofield cartridge as the standard cartridge. Despite the change, old stocks of the longer .45 Colt rounds in the supply line caused the Army to drop most of the Schofields and continue with the Colt. Major Schofield had patented his locking system and earned a payment on each gun that Smith & Wesson sold, and at the time his older brother, [[John M. Schofield]], was the head of the Army Ordnance Board and the political situation may have been the main issue for the early end of army sales.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nMany of the S&W Model 3 Schofield revolvers saw service in the [[Indian Wars]], and there are reports of them in use as late as the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] and [[Philippine\u2013American War]]. Like the other Smith & Wesson Model 3s, they were also reportedly popular with lawmen and outlaws in the American West, and were reportedly used by [[Jesse James]], [[Robert Ford (outlaw)|Bob Ford]] (who used one to kill James),<ref name=\"Agnew2012\">{{cite book|last=Agnew|first=Jeremy|title=The Old West in Fact and Film: History Versus Hollywood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R_mRcTRYcvsC&pg=PA150|date=1 November 2012|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-9311-1|page=150}}</ref> [[John Wesley Hardin]], [[Pat Garrett]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Virgil Earp]], [[Billy the Kid]], and many others. The Smith & Wesson No. 3 revolver was famously used by [[Wyatt Earp]] during the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral|OK Corral Gunfight]] with the [[Ike Clanton|Clanton Gang]].<ref name=boorman/>\n\nWhile the standard barrel length was 7\", many Schofields were purchased as surplus by distributors, and had the barrels shortened to 5\", and were refinished in nickel.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/> After the Spanish\u2013American War of 1898, the US Army sold off all their surplus Schofield revolvers. The surplus Schofield revolvers were reconditioned by wholesalers and gunsmiths (at professional factory-quality level) with a considerable number offered for sale on the commercial market with a 5-inch barrel as well as the standard size barrel of 7 inches.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nOf the most notable purchasers of these reconditioned model 3 Schofield revolvers was [[Wells Fargo and Company]], who purchased the revolvers for use by Wells Fargo Road Agents and had the barrels shortened to a more concealable 5 inches length. These revolvers were then inspected by the Wells Fargo armorer and uniquely stamped \"W.F. & Co\" or \"Wells Fargo & Co\", along with the original Smith & Wesson serial number re-stamped alongside the Wells Fargo stamping on the flat part of the barrel just forward of the barrel pivot as well as re-stamping any part of each revolver which had not originally been stamped or stamped in a location that would be difficult to view the serial number, when needed.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nThe Wells Fargo Schofield revolvers became so popular with collectors from the 1970s onwards that the unique Wells Fargo markings were being \"counterfeited\" or \"faked\" by unscrupulous sellers to enhance the value of other similar versions that had not been genuinely owned by Wells Fargo & Co.  There are more \"fake\" Wells Fargo marked Schofield revolvers than genuine ones in existence and, accordingly, a collector interested in purchasing a \"Wells Fargo\" Schofield revolver would be well advised to have a pre-purchase inspection and verification performed by an expert who specializes in this model.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nLieutenant Colonel Schofield shot himself on December 17, 1882, with a S&W Schofield revolver after suffering a bout of mental illness, stress and isolation.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Springfield Armory Museum|title=REVOLVER -  SMITH & WESSON REVOLVER MODEL 3 SCHOFIELD FIRST MODEL SINGLE ACTION .45 SN# 1532|url= http://ww2.rediscov.com/spring/VFPCGI.exe?IDCFile=/spring/DETAILS.IDC,SPECIFIC=9823,DATABASE=objects}}</ref>\n\nAn engraved, gold-plated New Model Number 3 with pearl grips was presented to sharpshooter [[Annie Oakley]] in the 1890s by her husband Frank Butler.

In the previous engineering, the posts of the frame would wear out after heavy usage.  Schofield's improvement called for heat treated, replaceable components at this sensitive \"wear\" area of the catch and latch. The serial number range also will give an indication of whether it is First or Second Model, with the serial numbers changing from the First Model to the Second Model at a little over 3,000.<ref name=S&W />\n\n====New Model Number 3====\n[[File:S & W 3rd New Model.jpg|thumb|Smith & Wesson No. 3, New Model, 44 Russian]]\nIn 1877, S&W discontinued production of its other Model 3s such as the American, Russian, and Schofield\u2014in favor a new improved design called the New Model Number Three. This new model has a longer cylinder allowing it to fire longer cartridges. Standard chambering was .44 Russian, although other calibers were offered on special order or in related models such as the .44-40 Frontier Model, the .32-44 & .38-44 Target Models, and the very rare .38-40 Winchester Model.<ref name=S&W />\n\n====Australian Model====\nIn 1880 the [[South Australia Police]], who were then interested in re-arming with up-to-date weapons, noted a display of New Model Number Three revolvers at the [[Australian Exposition]] in [[Melbourne]].  At the direction of [[William John Peterswald|Police Commissioner Peterswald]] an order was placed through S&W's New York agent for 250 nickel revolvers in [[.44 Russian]] with a seven-inch barrel length. The order, which included extension shoulder stocks, ammunition, and reloading kits, arrived at [[Adelaide]] in March 1882.  The revolvers and stocks were thereupon marked with a government [[Broad arrow#Use in Australia|broad arrow punch mark]], and were called [[revolver-carbines]].  They were issued to [[mounted police]], known as troopers, who at that period also policed the [[Northern Territory]].  Both the South Australia and [[Western Australia]] police made further small purchases during 1886-88, none of which was marked with the broad arrow.  For some thirty years the revolver-carbine was the front line weapon of the mounted police of S.A., W.A., and N.T.  Nearly all serial numbers are known, and are listed in the book ''Service Arms of the South Australian Police''.<ref>''Service Arms of the South Australian Police : 1838 to 1988, the first 150 years'' by Max Slee : (Antique & Historical Arms Assoc., of South Australia, Adelaide, 1988) {{ISBN|0-7316-4078-0}}:</ref> The S.A. revolvers were sold as surplus in 1953 to the Western Arms Corporation of [[Los Angeles]].\n\n====Smith & Wesson .44 Double Action First Model====\n[[File:S&W 44 DA Frontier.jpg|thumb|Smith & Wesson .44 Double Action Frontier]]\n\nThe Smith & Wesson .44 Double Action Frontier Revolver was made from 1881 to 1898. This revolver could be fired in both single- and [[Trigger (firearms)#Double-action|double action]], and used the typical S&W top-break ejection system. Chambered primarily in [[.44 Russian]], as well as [[.44 S&W American]] and [[.44-40]] it incorporated the company's familiar curved grip frame, with hard rubber or checkered walnut grips. It was available in blue and nickel-plated finishes, with 4, 5, 6, 6\u00bd and 8 inch barrels (the 5\" being the most common).\n<ref>https://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/2013/4/23/smith-wesson-44-double-action-first-model/</ref>\n\n==Copies==\nThe popular Model 3 was copied in many countries. Most common were the versions made in Spain, Mexico and Belgium; but companies such as [[Ludwig Loewe & Company]] of Germany and the [[Tula Arsenal]] in Russia played a hand in the counterfeit game, too. Copies have been found in Turkey and Pakistan as well, made by local manufacturers.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\n===11mm Orbea Hermanos y Cia. M1884 ''Sistema ON\u00c1'' (\"S&W Model 7\")===\n[[File:Rev\u00f3lver Orbea.jpg|thumb|An Orbea Hermanos revolver at the Seville Military History Museum.]]\n\nIn 1884 the Spanish government made a decree stating that any invention not copyrighted by their copyright office was not under their protection. One victim of this was Smith & Wesson, whose lucrative contract to produce Model 3 revolvers for the Spanish Army was quickly cancelled. Its work given to local gunsmiths in Eibar by different firms without any standardization of parts.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nThe [[Orbea|Orbea Hermanos]] ''Modelo 1884 Sistema ON\u00c1'' ([[Basque language|Basque]] ''on\u00e1'' > \"good\") or \"S&W Model 7\" revolver was made from 1884 until the 1920s. It is notable for its grip medallion, which is an \"OH\" interlaced like the Smith & Wesson \"S&W\".<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nAn interesting footnote is that Smith & Wesson immediately copyrighted all of their other designs in Spain from then on. That is why their firearms have MARCA REGISTRADA and the date of the Spanish patent on their barrels.<ref name=\"Lee2016\">{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Jerry|title=2016 Standard Catalog of Firearms: The Collector's Price and Reference Guide|date=29 January 2016|publisher=\"F+W Media, Inc.\"|isbn=978-1-4402-4441-4|page=1034}}</ref>\n\n===Liege copies===\nThere were a number of unauthorized Belgian copies made in [[.44 Russian]] and [[.44-40 Winchester]] as Single and Double Action revolvers. These copies, mostly manufactured in Liege, were marked as if to deceive a buyer into thinking that they were a revolver produced by Smith & Wesson. Many of the finer details such as the location of the Smith & Wesson factory were incorrectly stamped on the revolvers (\"New York\" and \"VK\" being the two most common).<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nSmith & Wesson brought lawsuits against two gunmakers in Liege, which they originally lost, but won on appeal.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\n===Users===\n====Italy====\nThe prime contractor for the Italian military was Orbea, which chambered their revolvers for the Italian [[:it:10,35 x 20 mm|10.4mm cartridge]].  These Spanish-made revolvers were used during World War I, and according to online sources were the preferred handgun of elite [[Arditi]] troops.\n\n====Philippines====\nMany Spanish firearms were captured by the [[Philippine Revolutionary Army|Liberation Army]] during the [[Philippine Revolution|Revolution]], among them Model 1884 revolvers. Some were brought by defectors from the Spanish military.  These handguns also saw service, later, in the [[Philippine-American War]].\n\n====Romania====\nRevolvers for the Romanian military were chambered for the .44 Russian cartridge, and were made by Trocaola, Aranzabal y C\u00eda.  These Spanish-made revolvers were used during World War I.\n\n====Spain====\nSpain used these revolvers, which were chambered for the .44 Russian cartridge, during the Philippine Revolution, the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], the [[Rif War]], and the [[Spanish Civil War]].\n\n====United Kingdom====\nThe ''M1884'' was later briefly made chambered in .455 Webley for British government contracts in 1915 and 1916. It was designated by the British Army as the \"Pistol, Old Pattern\", due to its old design. They were dubbed \"Spanish Webleys\" by troops even though they were copies of the S&W Model 3. Orbea Hermanos y Cia., [[:es:G.A.C.|Garate, Anitua y Cia.]], and Trocaola, Aranzabal y Cia. were contracted to make 30,000 revolvers among them. Orbea Hermanos was the major contractor and the other two were sub-contractors. Rexach & Urgoite was later contracted in 1916 to make 500 pistols but all failed proofing and the lot was refused.\n\nFinish and quality control was varied throughout the run of production. The fact that they were making service pistols and revolvers for France and Italy at the same time was definitely a factor.\n\nAs there was no standardization of design or parts between manufacturers, each manufacturer's model was considered a different gun altogether. The Garate, Anitua y Cia. model was designated the ''Pistol, Old Pattern, No.1 Mk.I'',<ref>Taylerson-Chamberlain, W. H. J. and A. W. F. ''Revolvers of the British Services, 1854-1944'', pp. 57-59.</ref><ref>Maze, Robert J. ''Howdah to High Power \u2013 A Century of British Breechloading Service Pistols (1867-1967)'', pp. 93-94</ref> the Trocaola, Aranzabal y Cia. model was designated the ''Pistol, Old Pattern, No.2 Mk.I'', and the Orbea Hermanos model was designated the ''Pistol, Old Pattern, No.3 Mk.I''.\n\nThe weapons were given to the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] after the war. The RUC later sold them off to the [[New South Wales Police Force]], who made snub-nosed revolvers out of them and issued them as backup pistols. A cut-down snub-nosed .455 \"Old Pattern\" Revolver was carried by one of [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]]' bodyguards.\n\n==Modern reproductions==\nModern reproductions of the Smith & Wesson model 3 Revolver are made by a number of companies, including (most notably) Smith & Wesson themselves, as well as the Italian arms-makers [[A.

Just before the rebellion, there were over 300,000 sepoys in the army, compared to about 50,000 British. The forces were divided into three [[presidency armies]]: [[Bombay Presidency|Bombay]], [[Madras Presidency|Madras]], and [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal]]. The [[Bengal Army]] recruited higher [[Caste system in India|castes]], such as [[Rajput]]s and [[Bhumihar]], mostly from the [[Awadh]] and [[Bengal]] regions, and even restricted the enlistment of lower castes in 1855. In contrast, the [[Madras Army]] and [[Bombay Army]] were \"more localized, caste-neutral armies\" that \"did not prefer high-caste men\".<ref>{{Citation|last=Mazumder|first=Rajit K.|title=The Indian Army and the Making of the Punjab|pages=7\u20138|year=2003|location=Delhi|publisher=Permanent Black|isbn=978-81-7824-059-6}}</ref> The domination of higher castes in the Bengal Army has been blamed in part for initial mutinies that led to the rebellion.\n\n[[File:Two Seapoy Officers; A Private Seapoy.jpg|thumb|upright|Two sepoy officers; a private sepoy, 1820s]]\n\nIn 1772, when [[Warren Hastings]] was appointed India's first [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]], one of his first undertakings was the rapid expansion of the Company's army. Since the sepoys from Bengal \u2013 many of whom had fought against the Company in the Battles of Plassey and Buxar \u2013 were now suspect in British eyes, Hastings recruited farther west from the high-caste rural Rajputs and Bhumihar of Awadh and Bengal, a practice that continued for the next 75 years. However, in order to forestall any social friction, the Company also took action to adapt its military practices to the requirements of their religious rituals. Consequently, these soldiers dined in separate facilities; in addition, overseas service, considered [[Kala pani (taboo)|polluting]] to their caste, was not required of them, and the army soon came officially to recognise Hindu festivals. \"This encouragement of high caste ritual status, however, left the government vulnerable to protest, even mutiny, whenever the sepoys detected infringement of their prerogatives.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p=61}}</ref>  Stokes argues that \"The British scrupulously avoided interference with the social structure of the village community which remained largely intact.\"<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Eric Stokes |author-link1=Eric Thomas Stokes |date=February 1973 |title=The first century of British colonial rule in India: social revolution or social stagnation? |url= |journal=Past & Present |publisher=Oxford University Press |volume=58 |issue=58 |pages=136\u2013160 |doi= 10.1093/past/58.1.136|jstor=650259}}</ref>\n\nAfter the annexation of Oudh (Awadh) by the East India Company in 1856, many sepoys were disquieted both from losing their perquisites, as landed gentry, in the Oudh courts, and from the anticipation of any increased land-revenue payments that the annexation might bring about.<ref name=brownp88>{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|p=88}}</ref> Other historians have stressed that by 1857, some Indian soldiers, interpreting the presence of missionaries as a sign of official intent, were convinced that the Company was masterminding mass conversions of Hindus and Muslims to Christianity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Metcalf|1990|p=48}}</ref>  Although earlier in the 1830s, evangelicals such as [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]] and [[William Wilberforce]] had successfully clamoured for the passage of social reform, such as the abolition of ''[[Sati (practice)|sati]]'' and allowing the remarriage of Hindu widows, there is little evidence that the sepoys' allegiance was affected by this.<ref name=brownp88/>\n\nHowever, changes in the terms of their professional service may have created resentment. As the extent of the East India Company's jurisdiction expanded with victories in wars or annexation, the soldiers were now expected not only to serve in less familiar regions, such as in [[Burma]], but also to make do without the \"foreign service\" remuneration that had previously been their due.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bandyopadhyay|2004|p=171}}, {{Harvnb|Bose|Jalal|2004|pp=70\u201372}}</ref>\n\nA major cause of resentment that arose ten months prior to the outbreak of the rebellion was the General Service Enlistment Act of 25 July 1856. As noted above, men of the Bengal Army had been exempted from overseas service. Specifically, they were enlisted only for service in territories to which they could march. Governor-General [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] saw this as an anomaly, since all sepoys of the Madras and Bombay Armies and the six \"General Service\" battalions of the Bengal Army had accepted an obligation to serve overseas if required. As a result, the burden of providing contingents for active service in Burma, readily accessible only by sea, and [[China]] had fallen disproportionately on the two smaller Presidency Armies. As signed into effect by [[Charles Canning, 1st Earl Canning|Lord Canning]], Dalhousie's successor as Governor-General, the act required only new recruits to the Bengal Army to accept a commitment for general service. However, serving high-caste sepoys were fearful that it would be eventually extended to them, as well as preventing sons following fathers into an army with a strong tradition of family service.<ref>''A Matter of Honour \u2013 an Account of the Indian Army, its Officers and Men'', Philip Mason, {{ISBN|0-333-41837-9}}, p. 261.</ref>\n\nThere were also grievances over the issue of promotions, based on seniority.

The rebels consisted of three groups: the feudal nobility, rural landlords called ''[[Talukdar|taluqdars]]'', and the peasants. The nobility, many of whom had lost titles and domains under the [[Doctrine of Lapse]], which refused to recognise the adopted children of princes as legal heirs, felt that the Company had interfered with a traditional system of inheritance. Rebel leaders such as [[Nana Sahib]] and the [[Rani of Jhansi]] belonged to this group; the latter, for example, was prepared to accept East India Company supremacy if her adopted son was recognised as her late husband's heir.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bandyopadhyay|2004|p=172}}, {{Harvnb|Bose|Jalal|2004|pp=72\u201373}}, {{Harvnb|Brown|1994|p=92}}</ref> In other areas of central India, such as [[Indore]] and [[Sagar, Madhya Pradesh|Saugar]], where such loss of privilege had not occurred, the princes remained loyal to the Company, even in areas where the sepoys had rebelled.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bandyopadhyay|2004|p=172}}</ref> The second group, the ''taluqdars'', had lost half their landed estates to peasant farmers as a result of the land reforms that came in the wake of annexation of [[Oudh]]. As the rebellion gained ground, the ''taluqdars'' quickly reoccupied the lands they had lost, and paradoxically, in part because of ties of kinship and feudal loyalty, did not experience significant opposition from the peasant farmers, many of whom joined the rebellion, to the great dismay of the British.<ref>{{Harvnb|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p=102}}</ref> It has also been suggested that heavy land-revenue assessment in some areas by the British resulted in many landowning families either losing their land or going into great debt to money lenders, and providing ultimately a reason to rebel; money lenders, in addition to the Company, were particular objects of the rebels' animosity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bose|Jalal|2004|p=72}}, {{Harvnb|Metcalf|1991|ch=2}}, {{Harvnb|Bandyopadhyay|2004|p=173}}</ref> The civilian rebellion was also highly uneven in its geographic distribution, even in areas of north-central India that were no longer under British control. For example, the relatively prosperous [[Muzaffarnagar]] district, a beneficiary of a Company irrigation scheme, and next door to [[Meerut]], where the upheaval began, stayed relatively calm throughout.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|p=92}}</ref>\n\n<Center>\n<gallery>\nFile:Charles Canning, 1st Earl Canning - Project Gutenberg eText 16528.jpg|[[Charles Canning, 1st Earl Canning|Charles Canning]], the [[Governor-General of India]] during the rebellion.\nFile:Dalhousie.jpg|[[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]], the Governor-General of India from 1848 to 1856, who devised the [[Doctrine of Lapse]].\nFile:Rani of jhansi.jpg|[[Rani of Jhansi|Lakshmibai, the Rani of Maratha-ruled Jhansi]], one of the principal leaders of the rebellion who earlier had lost her kingdom as a result of the [[Doctrine of Lapse]].\nFile:Bahadur Shah II of India.jpg|[[Bahadur Shah Zafar]] the last Mughal Emperor, crowned Emperor of India, by the Indian troops, he was deposed by the British, and died in exile in Burma\n</gallery>\n</Center>\n\n\"[[Utilitarian]] and [[Evangelism|evangelical]]-inspired social reform\",<ref>Susanne Hoeber Rudolph, Lloyd I.

Of these, the Army of the Bengal Presidency was the largest. Unlike the other two, it recruited heavily from among high-caste Hindus and comparatively wealthy Muslims. The Muslims formed a larger percentage of the 18 irregular cavalry units<ref>{{cite book|first=Boris|last=Mollo|page=54|title=The Indian Army|publisher=Littlehampton Book Services Ltd|year=1981|isbn=978-0713710748}}</ref> within the Bengal Army, whilst Hindus were mainly to be found in the 84 regular infantry and cavalry regiments. The [[sepoy]]s were therefore affected to a large degree by the concerns of the landholding and traditional members of Indian society. In the early years of Company rule, it tolerated and even encouraged the caste privileges and customs within the Bengal Army, which recruited its regular soldiers almost exclusively amongst the landowning [[Brahmin]]s and [[Rajput]]s of the [[Bihar]] and [[Awadh]] regions. These soldiers were known as [[Purbiya]]s. By the time these customs and privileges came to be threatened by modernising regimes in Calcutta from the 1840s onwards, the sepoys had become accustomed to very high ritual status and were extremely sensitive to suggestions that their caste might be polluted.<ref>Seema Alavi ''The Sepoys and the Company'' (Delhi: Oxford University Press) 1998, p. 5.</ref>\n\nThe sepoys also gradually became dissatisfied with various other aspects of army life. Their pay was relatively low and after [[Awadh]] and the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] were annexed, the soldiers no longer received extra pay (''batta'' or ''bhatta'') for service there, because they were no longer considered \"foreign missions\". The junior European officers became increasingly estranged from their soldiers, in many cases treating them as their racial inferiors.  In 1856, a new Enlistment Act was introduced by the Company, which in theory made every unit in the Bengal Army liable to service overseas. Although it was intended to apply only to new recruits, the serving sepoys feared that the Act might be applied retroactively to them as well.<ref>{{cite book|first=Saul|last=David|page=24|title=The Indian Mutiny|isbn=978-0-141-00554-6|date=2003-09-04}}</ref> A high-caste Hindu who travelled in the cramped conditions of a wooden troop ship could not cook his own food on his own fire, and accordingly risked losing caste through ritual pollution.<ref>{{cite book|first=Philip|last=Mason|page=243|title=A Matter of Honour|isbn=978-0-333-41837-6|year=1986}}</ref>\n\n==Onset of the Rebellion==\n[[File:Indian Mutiny Map Showing Position of Troops on 1st May 1857.jpg|300px|thumb|Indian mutiny map showing position of troops on 1 May 1857]]\nSeveral months of increasing tensions coupled with various incidents preceded the actual rebellion. On 26 February 1857 the 19th [[Bengal Native Infantry]] (BNI) regiment became concerned that new cartridges they had been issued were wrapped in paper greased with cow and pig fat, which had to be opened by mouth thus affecting their religious sensibilities. Their Colonel confronted them supported by artillery and cavalry on the parade ground, but after some negotiation withdrew the artillery, and cancelled the next morning's parade.<ref>Memorandum from Lieutenant-Colonel W.

Informed about Pandey's behaviour Sergeant-Major James Hewson went to investigate, only to have Pandey shoot at him. Hewson raised the alarm.<ref name=\"David 2003 69\">{{Harvnb|David|2003|p=69}}</ref> When his [[adjutant]] Lt.

Publishers, New Delhi.</ref>\n\nGeneral John Hearsey came out to the parade ground to investigate, and claimed later that Mangal Pandey was in some kind of \"religious frenzy\". He ordered the Indian commander of the [[quarter guard]] [[Jemadar]] Ishwari Prasad to arrest Mangal Pandey, but the Jemadar refused.  The quarter guard and other sepoys present, with the single exception of a soldier called [[Shaikh Paltu]], drew back from restraining or arresting Mangal Pandey.  Shaikh Paltu restrained Pandey from continuing his attack.<ref name=\"Malleson\"/><ref>Durendra Nath Sen, p. 50 ''Eighteen Fifty-Seven'', The Publications Division, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Government of India, May 1957.</ref>\n\nAfter failing to incite his comrades into an open and active rebellion, Mangal Pandey tried to take his own life, by placing his musket to his chest and pulling the trigger with his toe.  He managed only to wound himself. He was court-martialled on 6 April, and hanged two days later.\n\nThe Jemadar Ishwari Prasad was sentenced to death and hanged on 22 April.  The regiment was disbanded and stripped of its uniforms because it was felt that it harboured ill-feelings towards its superiors, particularly after this incident.  Shaikh Paltu was promoted to the rank of [[havildar]] in the Bengal Army, but was murdered shortly before the 34th BNI dispersed.<ref>{{cite book|first=Kim A. |last=Wagner|page=97|title=The Great Fear of 1857.

The demonstration of disgrace during the formal disbanding helped foment the rebellion in view of some historians. Disgruntled ex-sepoys returned home to Awadh with a desire for revenge.\n\n===Unrest during April 1857===\nDuring April, there was unrest and fires at [[Agra]], [[Allahabad]] and [[Ambala]]. At Ambala in particular, which was a large military cantonment where several units had been collected for their annual musketry practice, it was clear to General Anson, Commander-in-Chief of the Bengal Army, that some sort of rebellion over the cartridges was imminent. Despite the objections of the civilian Governor-General's staff, he agreed to postpone the musketry practice and allow a new drill by which the soldiers tore the cartridges with their fingers rather than their teeth. However, he issued no general orders making this standard practice throughout the Bengal Army and, rather than remain at Ambala to defuse or overawe potential trouble, he then proceeded to [[Shimla|Simla]], the cool \"hill station\" where many high officials spent the summer.\n\nAlthough there was no open revolt at Ambala, there was widespread arson during late April. Barrack buildings (especially those belonging to soldiers who had used the Enfield cartridges) and European officers' bungalows were set on fire.<ref>{{harvnb|Hibbert|1980|pp=73\u201375}}</ref>\n\n===Meerut===\n[[File:The Sepoy revolt at Meerut.jpg|thumb|\"The Sepoy revolt at Meerut,\" from the Illustrated London News, 1857]]\n[[File:1857 mutineers mosque meerut2.jpg|thumb|An 1858 photograph by [[Felice Beato]] of a mosque in Meerut where some of the rebel soldiers may have prayed]]\n\nAt [[Meerut]], a large military cantonment, 2,357 Indian sepoys and 2,038 British soldiers were stationed along with 12 British-manned guns. The station held one of the largest concentrations of British troops in India and this was later to be cited as evidence that the original rising was a spontaneous outbreak rather than a pre-planned plot.<ref name=Mason278>{{Citation|first=Philip|last=Mason|page=278|title=A Matter of Honour \u2013 an Account of the Indian Army|isbn=978-0-333-41837-6|year=1986}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the state of unrest within the Bengal Army was well known, on 24 April Lieutenant Colonel George Carmichael-Smyth, the unsympathetic commanding officer of the [[3rd Bengal Light Cavalry]], ordered 90 of his men to parade and perform firing drills. All except five of the men on parade refused to accept their cartridges. On 9 May, the remaining 85 men were [[court martial]]led, and most were sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment with hard labour. Eleven comparatively young soldiers were given five years' imprisonment. The entire garrison was paraded and watched as the condemned men were stripped of their uniforms and placed in shackles. As they were marched off to jail, the condemned soldiers berated their comrades for failing to support them.\n\nThe next day was Sunday. Some Indian soldiers warned off-duty junior European officers that plans were afoot to release the imprisoned soldiers by force, but the senior officers to whom this was reported took no action. There was also unrest in the city of Meerut itself, with angry protests in the bazaar and some buildings being set on fire. In the evening, most European officers were preparing to attend church, while many of the European soldiers were off duty and had gone into canteens or into the bazaar in Meerut. The Indian troops, led by the 3rd Cavalry, broke into revolt. European junior officers who attempted to quell the first outbreaks were killed by the rebels. European officers' and civilians' quarters were attacked, and four civilian men, eight women and eight children were killed. Crowds in the bazaar attacked off-duty soldiers there. About 50 Indian civilians, some of them officers' servants who tried to defend or conceal their employers, were killed by the sepoys.<ref name=\"David 2003 93\">{{Harvnb|David|2003|p=93}}</ref> While the action of the sepoys in freeing their 85 imprisoned comrades appears to have been spontaneous, some civilian rioting in the city was reportedly encouraged by [[kotwal]] (local police commander) [[Dhan Singh Gurjar]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1980|pp=80\u201385}}</ref>\n\nSome sepoys (especially from the 11th Bengal Native Infantry) escorted trusted British officers and women and children to safety before joining the revolt.<ref>Sir John Kaye & G. B. Malleson: ''The Indian Mutiny of 1857'', (Delhi: Rupa & Co.) reprint 2005, p. 49.</ref> Some officers and their families escaped to [[Rampur, Uttar Pradesh|Rampur]], where they found refuge with the Nawab.\n\nThe British historian Philip Mason notes that it was inevitable that most of the sepoys and sowars from Meerut should have made for Delhi on the night of 10 May. It was a strong walled city located only forty miles away, it was the ancient capital and present seat of the nominal Mughal Emperor and finally there were no British troops in garrison there in contrast to Meerut.<ref name=Mason278/> No effort was made to pursue them.\n\n===Delhi===\n[[File:Massacre of officers by insurgent cavalry at Delhi,.jpg|thumb|Massacre of officers by insurgent cavalry at Delhi]]\n\nEarly on 11 May, the first parties of the 3rd Cavalry reached Delhi. From beneath the windows of the King's apartments in the palace, they called on him to acknowledge and lead them. [[Bahadur Shah II|Bahadur Shah]] did nothing at this point, apparently treating the sepoys as ordinary petitioners, but others in the palace were quick to join the revolt.  During the day, the revolt spread.  European officials and dependents, Indian Christians and shop keepers within the city were killed, some by sepoys and others by crowds of rioters.<ref>Dr. Surendra Nath Sen, pages 71\u201373 \"Eighteen Fifty-Seven\", Publications Division, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Government of India.</ref>\n\n[[File:1858 Delhi flag tower.jpg|thumb|The [[Flagstaff Tower]], Delhi, where the European survivors of the rebellion gathered on 11 May 1857; photographed by [[Felice Beato]]]]\n\nThere were three battalion-sized regiments of Bengal Native Infantry stationed in or near the city. Some detachments quickly joined the rebellion, while others held back but also refused to obey orders to take action against the rebels. In the afternoon, a violent explosion in the city was heard for several miles. Fearing that the arsenal, which contained large stocks of arms and ammunition, would fall intact into rebel hands, the nine British Ordnance officers there had opened fire on the sepoys, including the men of their own guard. When resistance appeared hopeless, they blew up the arsenal. Six of the nine officers survived, but the blast killed many in the streets and nearby houses and other buildings.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1980|pp=98\u2013101}}</ref> The news of these events finally tipped the sepoys stationed around Delhi into open rebellion.  The sepoys were later able to salvage at least some arms from the arsenal, and a magazine two miles (3&nbsp;km) outside Delhi, containing up to 3,000 barrels of gunpowder, was captured without resistance.\n\nMany fugitive European officers and civilians had congregated at the [[Flagstaff Tower]] on the ridge north of Delhi, where telegraph operators were sending news of the events to other British stations.  When it became clear that the help expected from Meerut was not coming, they made their way in carriages to [[Karnal]].  Those who became separated from the main body or who could not reach the Flagstaff Tower also set out for Karnal on foot. Some were helped by villagers on the way; others were killed.\n\nThe next day, Bahadur Shah held his first formal court for many years. It was attended by many excited sepoys. The King was alarmed by the turn events had taken, but eventually accepted the sepoys' allegiance and agreed to give his countenance to the rebellion. On 16 May, up to 50 Europeans who had been held prisoner in the palace or had been discovered hiding in the city were killed by some of the King's servants under a [[peepul tree]] in a courtyard outside the palace.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1980|pp=93\u201395}}</ref><ref>Dalrymple, ''The Last Moghul'', pp. 223\u2013224.</ref>\n\n==Supporters and opposition==\n[[File:Indian revolt of 1857 states map.svg|thumb|250px|States during the rebellion]]\n\nThe news of the events at [[Meerut]] and [[Delhi]] spread rapidly, provoking uprisings among sepoys and disturbances in many districts. In many cases, it was the behaviour of British military and civilian authorities themselves which precipitated disorder. Learning of the fall of Delhi, many Company administrators hastened to remove themselves, their families and servants to places of safety.

Firstly, many Sikhs resented that Hindustanis/[[Purbiya]]s in service of the Sikh state had been foremost in urging the wars, which lost them their independence. Sikh soldiers also recalled that the bloodiest battles of the war, [[Battle of Chillianwala|Chillianwala]] and [[Battle of Ferozeshah|Ferozeshah]], were won by British troops, and they believed that the Hindustani sepoys had refused to meet them in battle. These feelings were compounded when Hindustani sepoys were assigned a very visible role as garrison troops in Punjab and awarded profit-making civil posts in Punjab.<ref name=Kennedy216/>\n\nIn 1857, the Bengal Army had 86,000 men, of which 12,000 were European, 16,000 Sikh and 1,500 Gurkha.

In total, only twelve of the original Bengal Native Infantry regiments survived to pass into the new Indian Army.<ref>''Indian Army Uniforms under the British \u2013 Infantry'', W. Y.

Of these, a substantial contingent from the recently annexed state of Awadh mutinied ''en masse''. Another large contingent from Gwalior also mutinied, even though that state's ruler supported the British. The remainder of the irregular units were raised from a wide variety of sources and were less affected by the concerns of mainstream Indian society. Some irregular units actively supported the Company: three Gurkha and five of six Sikh infantry units, and the six infantry and six cavalry units of the recently raised Punjab Irregular Force.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defencejournal.com/2001/august/sepoy.htm|title=The Sepoy Rebellion of 1857\u201359 \u2013 A.

When European troops were reinforced and began to counterattack, the mutineers were especially handicapped by their lack of centralized command and control. Although the rebels produced some natural leaders such as [[Bakht Khan]], whom the Emperor later nominated as commander-in-chief after his son [[Mirza Mughal]] proved ineffectual, for the most part they were forced to look for leadership to rajahs and princes.

The siege lasted roughly from 1 July to 21 September. However, the encirclement was hardly complete, and for much of the siege the Company forces were outnumbered and it often seemed that it was the Company forces and not Delhi that were under siege, as the rebels could easily receive resources and reinforcements. For several weeks, it seemed likely that disease, exhaustion and continuous sorties by rebels from Delhi would force the Company forces to withdraw, but the outbreaks of rebellion in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] were forestalled or suppressed, allowing the [[Punjab Movable Column]] of British, Sikh and Pakhtun soldiers under [[John Nicholson (general)|John Nicholson]] to reinforce the besiegers on the Ridge on 14 August.<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/mp/2006/10/28/stories/2006102801590100.htm God's Acre].

He had relied on his own prestige, and his cordial relations with the [[Nana Sahib]] to thwart rebellion, and took comparatively few measures to prepare fortifications and lay in supplies and ammunition.\n\nThe besieged endured three weeks of the [[Siege of Cawnpore]] with little water or food, suffering continuous casualties to men, women and children.  On 25 June Nana Sahib made an offer of safe passage to Allahabad.  With barely three days' food rations remaining, the British agreed provided they could keep their small arms and that the evacuation should take place in daylight on the morning of the 27th (the Nana Sahib wanted the evacuation to take place on the night of the 26th).  Early in the morning of 27 June, the European party left their entrenchment and made their way to the river where boats provided by the Nana Sahib were waiting to take them to [[Allahabad]].<ref>''The story of Cawnpore: The Indian Mutiny 1857'', Capt.

That very moment someone from the crowd blew a loud bugle, which created disorder and in the ongoing bewilderment, the boatmen jumped off the boats.  The rebels started shooting indiscriminately.

With Company forces approaching Cawnpore and some believing that they would not advance if there were no hostages to save, their murders were ordered.

Other historians have suggested that the killings were an attempt to undermine Nana Sahib's relationship with the British.<ref name=autogenerated3>John Harris, The Indian mutiny, Wordsworth military library 2001, p. 92.</ref> Perhaps it was due to fear, the fear of being recognised by some of the prisoners for having taken part in the earlier firings.<ref name=autogenerated4 />\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:1857 hospital wheeler cawnpore2.jpg|Photograph entitled, \"The Hospital in General Wheeler's entrenchment, Cawnpore\".

Albumen silver print by [[Felice Beato]], 1858]]\n\nVery soon after the events at [[Meerut]], rebellion erupted in the state of [[Awadh]] (also known as Oudh, in modern-day [[Uttar Pradesh]]), which had been annexed barely a year before. The British Commissioner resident at [[Lucknow]], [[Henry Montgomery Lawrence|Sir Henry Lawrence]], had enough time to fortify his position inside the Residency compound. The defenders, including loyal sepoys, numbered some 1700 men. The rebels' assaults were unsuccessful, so they began a barrage of artillery and musket fire into the compound. Lawrence was one of the first casualties. He was succeeded by [[John Eardley Inglis]]. The rebels tried to breach the walls with explosives and bypass them via tunnels that led to underground close combat.<ref name=HCRE/>{{rp|486}} After 90 days of siege, the defenders were reduced to 300 loyal sepoys, 350 British soldiers and 550 non-combatants.\n\nOn 25 September, a relief column under the command of [[Sir Henry Havelock]] and accompanied by [[Sir James Outram, 1st Baronet|Sir James Outram]] (who in theory was his superior) fought its way from Cawnpore to Lucknow in a brief campaign, in which the numerically small column defeated rebel forces in a series of increasingly large battles. This became known as 'The First Relief of Lucknow', as this force was not strong enough to break the siege or extricate themselves, and so was forced to join the garrison. In October, another larger army under the new Commander-in-Chief, [[Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde|Sir Colin Campbell]], was finally able to relieve the garrison and on 18 November, they evacuated the defended enclave within the city, the women and children leaving first. They then conducted an orderly withdrawal, firstly to [[Alambagh]] {{convert|4|mi|km}} north where a force of 4,000 were left to construct a fort, then to Cawnpore, where they defeated an attempt by Tantia Tope to recapture the city in the [[Second Battle of Cawnpore]].\n\nIn March 1858, Campbell once again advanced on Lucknow with a large army, meeting up with the force at Alambagh, this time seeking to suppress the rebellion in Awadh. He was aided by a large [[Nepal]]ese contingent advancing from the north under [[Jung Bahadur Kunwar Rana]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1980|pp=358, 428}}</ref> General [[Dhir Shamsher Rana|Dhir Shamsher Kunwar Rana]], the youngest brother of Jung Bahadur, also led the Nepalese forces in various parts of India including [[Lucknow]], [[Benares]] and [[Patna]].<ref name=\"Tyagi1974\">{{cite book | first = Sushila |last= Tyagi | title = Indo-Nepalese Relations: (1858 - 1914) | publisher = Concept Publishing Company | location = India | year = 1974 | isbn = | url = https://books.google.com.np/books?id=O0aOlkayZnQC }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | first = Shreeram Prasad | last= Upadhyay | title = Indo-Nepal trade relations: a historical analysis of Nepal's trade with the British India | publisher = Nirala Publications | location = India | year =1992 | isbn = | url = https://books.google.com.np/books?id=o_oVAQAAMAAJ }}</ref> Campbell's advance was slow and methodical, with a force under [[Sir James Outram, 1st Baronet|General Outram]] crossing the river on cask bridges on 4 March to enable them to fire artillery in flank.

When the Raja of Jhansi died without a biological male heir in 1853, it was annexed to the [[British Raj]] by the [[Governor-General of India]] under the [[doctrine of lapse]]. His widow Rani Lakshmi Bai, the [[Rani of Jhansi]], protested against the denial of rights of their adopted son. When war broke out, Jhansi quickly became a centre of the rebellion. A small group of Company officials and their families took refuge in [[Jhansi Fort]], and the Rani negotiated their evacuation. However, when they left the fort they were massacred by the rebels over whom the Rani had no control; the Europeans suspected the Rani of complicity, despite her repeated denials.\n\nBy the end of June 1857, the Company had lost control of much of [[Bundelkhand]] and eastern [[Rajasthan]]. The Bengal Army units in the area, having rebelled, marched to take part in the battles for Delhi and Cawnpore. The many princely states that made up this area began warring amongst themselves. In September and October 1857, the Rani led the successful defence of Jhansi against the invading armies of the neighbouring rajas of [[Datia]] and [[Orchha]].\n\nOn 3 February, Sir [[Hugh Rose, 1st Baron Strathnairn|Hugh Rose]] broke the 3-month siege of Saugor. Thousands of local villagers welcomed him as a liberator, freeing them from rebel occupation.<ref>Essential Histories, the Indian Mutiny 1857\u201358, Gregory Fremont-Barnes, Osprey 2007, p. 79.</ref>\n\nIn March 1858, the Central India Field Force, led by Sir Hugh Rose, advanced on and laid siege to Jhansi. The Company forces captured the city, but the Rani fled in disguise.\n\nAfter being driven from Jhansi and [[Kalpi]], on 1 June 1858 Rani Lakshmi Bai and a group of Maratha rebels captured the fortress city of [[Gwalior]] from the [[Scindia]] rulers, who were British allies. This might have reinvigorated the rebellion but the Central India Field Force very quickly advanced against the city. The Rani died on 17 June, the second day of the Battle of Gwalior, probably killed by a carbine shot from the [[8th King's Royal Irish Hussars]] according to the account of three independent Indian representatives. The Company forces recaptured Gwalior within the next three days. In descriptions of the scene of her last battle, she was compared to [[Joan of Arc]] by some commentators.<ref>Lachmi Bai Rani of Jhansi, the Jeanne d'Arc of India (1901), White, Michael (Michael Alfred Edwin), 1866, New York: J.F.

It included not only the present-day Indian and Pakistani Punjabi regions but also the North West Frontier districts bordering Afghanistan.\n\nMuch of the region had been the [[Sikh Empire]], ruled by [[Ranjit Singh]] until his death in 1839. The kingdom had then fallen into disorder, with court factions and the [[Khalsa]] (the Sikh army) contending for power at the Lahore Durbar (court). After two Anglo-Sikh Wars, the entire region was annexed by the East India Company in 1849. In 1857, the region still contained the highest numbers of both European and Indian troops.\n\nThe inhabitants of the Punjab were not as sympathetic to the sepoys as they were elsewhere in India, which limited many of the outbreaks in the Punjab to disjointed uprisings by regiments of sepoys isolated from each other. In some garrisons, notably [[Ferozepore]], indecision on the part of the senior European officers allowed the sepoys to rebel, but the sepoys then left the area, mostly heading for Delhi.<ref name=\"Project Gutenberg\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/w/captcha/question/|title=Project Gutenberg}}</ref> At the most important garrison, that of [[Peshawar]] close to the Afghan frontier, many comparatively junior officers ignored their nominal commander, [[Thomas Reed (British Army officer)|General Reed]], and took decisive action. They intercepted the sepoys' mail, thus preventing their coordinating an uprising, and formed a force known as the \"Punjab Movable Column\" to move rapidly to suppress any revolts as they occurred. When it became clear from the intercepted correspondence that some of the sepoys at Peshawar were on the point of open revolt, the four most disaffected Bengal Native regiments were disarmed by the two British infantry regiments in the cantonment, backed by artillery, on 22 May.

At Fatehgarh, for example, when the English defeated the enemy, their officers ordered a mass scale killing [of] the rebels and the citizens on the spot. General Neill had also ordered Hanging parties.... No evidence was sought and none given before executing the victim.... When the [78th] Highlanders moved to another village, they caught about 140 men, women and children. They selected sixty men from the group, forced them to build the gallows of wooden logs taken from the burning homes. They then chose ten men of the group [and] hanged them without any evidence or trial. For others, they had reserved flogging and beating to teach them a lesson..... At one of the villages, about two thousand villagers armed only with their lathis [wooden canes] turned out in protest. They stood up to face the [78th] Highlanders. The British troops surrounded them and set their village on fire.... The villagers trying to escape were shot to death. One soldier describes the incident thus: 'We took eighteen of them prisoners; they were all tied together, and we fired a volley at them and shot them on the spot' .... Stringing and shooting the men in front of their family was a sport the troops enjoyed. Watching women stooping and begging for the lives of their men seemed to thrill the young soldiers and their officers. The prisoners were made to stand under the hot summer sun for hours till they fainted. It was easy to flog them when they were half-conscious, otherwise, they would squirm and make it hard to strike.

In August, by the [[Government of India Act 1858]], the company was formally dissolved and its ruling powers over India were transferred to the British Crown.<ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/393/ |title = Official, India |work = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1890\u20131923 |accessdate = 30 May 2013}}</ref> A new British government department, the [[India Office]], was created to handle the governance of India, and its head, the [[Secretary of State for India]], was entrusted with formulating Indian policy. The Governor-General of India gained a new title, [[Viceroy of India]], and implemented the policies devised by the India Office. Some former East India Company territories, such as the [[Straits Settlements]], became colonies in their own right. The British colonial administration embarked on a program of reform, trying to integrate Indian higher castes and rulers into the government and abolishing attempts at [[Westernization]]. The Viceroy stopped land grabs, decreed religious tolerance and admitted Indians into civil service, albeit mainly as subordinates.\n\nEssentially the old East India Company bureaucracy remained, though there was a major shift in attitudes. In looking for the causes of the Rebellion the authorities alighted on two things: religion and the economy. On religion it was felt that there had been too much interference with indigenous traditions, both Hindu and Muslim. On the economy it was now believed that the previous attempts by the Company to introduce free market competition had undermined traditional power structures and bonds of loyalty placing the peasantry at the mercy of merchants and money-lenders. In consequence the new [[British Raj]] was constructed in part around a conservative agenda, based on a preservation of tradition and hierarchy.\n\nOn a political level it was also felt that the previous lack of consultation between rulers and ruled had been another significant factor in contributing to the uprising. In consequence, Indians were drawn into government at a local level. Though this was on a limited scale a crucial precedent had been set, with the creation of a new 'white collar' Indian elite, further stimulated by the opening of universities at Calcutta, Bombay and Madras, a result of the Indian Universities Act. So, alongside the values of traditional and ancient India, a new professional middle class was starting to arise, in no way bound by the values of the past. Their ambition can only have been stimulated by Queen Victoria's Proclamation of November 1858, in which it is expressly stated, \"We hold ourselves bound to the natives of our Indian territories by the same obligations of duty which bind us to our other subjects...it is our further will that... our subjects of whatever race or creed, be freely and impartially admitted to offices in our service, the duties of which they may be qualified by their education, ability and integrity, duly to discharge.\"\n\nActing on these sentiments, [[George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon|Lord Ripon]], viceroy from 1880 to 1885, extended the powers of local self-government and sought to remove racial practices in the law courts by the [[Ilbert Bill]]. But a policy at once liberal and progressive at one turn was reactionary and backward at the next, creating new elites and confirming old attitudes. The Ilbert Bill had the effect only of causing a [[white mutiny]] and the end of the prospect of perfect equality before the law. In 1886 measures were adopted to restrict Indian entry into the civil service.\n\n===Military reorganisation===\n[[File:Captain C Scott of the Gen. Sir. Hope Grant's Column, Sepoy Mutiny, 1857.

Metcalf says Stokes undermines the assumption that 1857 was a response to general causes emanating from entire classes of people.  Instead, Stokes argues that 1) those Indians who suffered the greatest relative deprivation rebelled and that 2) the decisive factor in precipitating a revolt was the presence of prosperous magnates who supported British rule.  Stokes also explores issues of economic development, the nature of privileged landholding, the role of moneylenders, the usefulness of classical rent theory, and, especially, the notion of the \"rich peasant\".<ref>Thomas R.

Speaking in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] in July 1857, [[Benjamin Disraeli]] labelled it a 'national revolt' while [[Lord Palmerston]], the Prime Minister, tried to downplay the scope and the significance of the event as a 'mere military mutiny'.<ref>''The Indian Mutiny and Victorian Trauma'' by Christopher Herbert, Princeton University Press, Princeton 2007.</ref> Reflecting this debate, an early historian of the rebellion, Charles Ball, used the word mutiny in his title, but labelled it a \"struggle for liberty and independence as a people\" in the text.<ref>''The History of the Indian Mutiny: Giving a detailed account of the sepoy insurrection in India'' by Charles Ball, The London Printing and Publishing Company, London, 1860.</ref> Historians remain divided on whether the rebellion can properly be considered a war of Indian independence or not,<ref>V.D. Savarkar argues that the rebellion was a war of Indian independence. ''The Indian War of Independence: 1857'' (Bombay: 1947 [1909]). Most historians have seen his arguments as discredited, with one venturing so far as to say, 'It was neither first, nor national, nor a war of independence.' Eric Stokes has argued that the rebellion was actually a variety of movements, not one movement. ''The Peasant Armed'' (Oxford: 1980). See also S. B. Chaudhuri, ''Civil Rebellion in the Indian Mutinies 1857\u20131859'' (Calcutta: 1957).</ref> although it is popularly considered to be one in India. Arguments against include:\n* A united India did not exist at that time in political, cultural, or ethnic terms;\n* The rebellion was put down with the help of other Indian soldiers drawn from the Madras Army, the Bombay Army and the Sikh regiments; 80% of the East India Company forces were Indian;<ref>The Indian Mutiny, Spilsbury Julian, Orion, 2007.</ref>\n* Many of the local rulers fought amongst themselves rather than uniting against the British;\n* Many rebel Sepoy regiments disbanded and went home rather than fight;\n* Not all of the rebels accepted the return of the Mughals;\n* The King of Delhi had no real control over the mutineers;<ref>S&T magazine issue 121 (September 1988), p. 20.</ref>\n* The revolt was largely limited to north and central India. Whilst risings occurred elsewhere they had little impact because of their limited nature;\n* A number of revolts occurred in areas not under British rule, and against native rulers, often as a result of local internal politics;\n* \"The revolt was fractured along religious, ethnic and regional lines.<ref>The communal hatred led to ugly communal riots in many parts of U.P. The green flag was hoisted and Muslims in Bareilly, Bijnor, Moradabad, and other places the Muslims shouted for the revival of Muslim kingdom.\" [[R. C.

Albumen silver print by [[Felice Beato]], 1857.]]\nA second school of thought while acknowledging the validity of the above-mentioned arguments opines that this rebellion may indeed be called a war of India's independence. The reasons advanced are:\n* Even though the rebellion had various causes, most of the rebel sepoys who were able to do so, made their way to Delhi to revive the old [[Mughal empire]] that signified national unity for even the Hindus amongst them;\n* There was a widespread popular revolt in many areas such as [[Awadh]], [[Bundelkhand]] and [[Rohilkhand]]. The rebellion was therefore more than just a military rebellion, and it spanned more than one region;\n* The sepoys did not seek to revive small kingdoms in their regions, instead they repeatedly proclaimed a \"country-wide rule\" of the Mughals and vowed to drive out the British from \"India\", as they knew it then. (The sepoys ignored local princes and proclaimed in cities they took over: ''Khalq Khuda Ki, Mulk Badshah Ka, Hukm Subahdar Sipahi Bahadur Ka'' \u2013 \"the people belong to God, the country to the Emperor and authority to the Sepoy Commandant\"). The objective of driving out \"foreigners\" from not only one's own area but from their conception of the entirety of \"India\", signifies a nationalist sentiment;\n* The mutineers, although some were recruited from outside Oudah, displayed a common purpose.<ref>[[Sitaram Yechury]].

Just before the rebellion, there were over 300,000 sepoys in the army, compared to about 50,000 British. The forces were divided into three [[presidency armies]]: [[Bombay Presidency|Bombay]], [[Madras Presidency|Madras]], and [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal]]. The [[Bengal Army]] recruited higher [[Caste system in India|castes]], such as [[Rajput]]s and [[Bhumihar]], mostly from the [[Awadh]] and [[Bengal]] regions, and even restricted the enlistment of lower castes in 1855. In contrast, the [[Madras Army]] and [[Bombay Army]] were \"more localized, caste-neutral armies\" that \"did not prefer high-caste men\".<ref>{{Citation|last=Mazumder|first=Rajit K.|title=The Indian Army and the Making of the Punjab|pages=7\u20138|year=2003|location=Delhi|publisher=Permanent Black|isbn=978-81-7824-059-6}}</ref> The domination of higher castes in the Bengal Army has been blamed in part for initial mutinies that led to the rebellion.\n\n[[File:Two Seapoy Officers; A Private Seapoy.jpg|thumb|upright|Two sepoy officers; a private sepoy, 1820s]]\n\nIn 1772, when [[Warren Hastings]] was appointed India's first [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]], one of his first undertakings was the rapid expansion of the Company's army. Since the sepoys from Bengal \u2013 many of whom had fought against the Company in the Battles of Plassey and Buxar \u2013 were now suspect in British eyes, Hastings recruited farther west from the high-caste rural Rajputs and Bhumihar of Awadh and Bengal, a practice that continued for the next 75 years. However, in order to forestall any social friction, the Company also took action to adapt its military practices to the requirements of their religious rituals. Consequently, these soldiers dined in separate facilities; in addition, overseas service, considered [[Kala pani (taboo)|polluting]] to their caste, was not required of them, and the army soon came officially to recognise Hindu festivals. \"This encouragement of high caste ritual status, however, left the government vulnerable to protest, even mutiny, whenever the sepoys detected infringement of their prerogatives.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p=61}}</ref>  Stokes argues that \"The British scrupulously avoided interference with the social structure of the village community which remained largely intact.\"<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Eric Stokes |author-link1=Eric Thomas Stokes |date=February 1973 |title=The first century of British colonial rule in India: social revolution or social stagnation? |url= |journal=Past & Present |publisher=Oxford University Press |volume=58 |issue=58 |pages=136\u2013160 |doi= 10.1093/past/58.1.136|jstor=650259}}</ref>\n\nAfter the annexation of Oudh (Awadh) by the East India Company in 1856, many sepoys were disquieted both from losing their perquisites, as landed gentry, in the Oudh courts, and from the anticipation of any increased land-revenue payments that the annexation might bring about.<ref name=brownp88>{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|p=88}}</ref> Other historians have stressed that by 1857, some Indian soldiers, interpreting the presence of missionaries as a sign of official intent, were convinced that the Company was masterminding mass conversions of Hindus and Muslims to Christianity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Metcalf|1990|p=48}}</ref>  Although earlier in the 1830s, evangelicals such as [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]] and [[William Wilberforce]] had successfully clamoured for the passage of social reform, such as the abolition of ''[[Sati (practice)|sati]]'' and allowing the remarriage of Hindu widows, there is little evidence that the sepoys' allegiance was affected by this.<ref name=brownp88/>\n\nHowever, changes in the terms of their professional service may have created resentment. As the extent of the East India Company's jurisdiction expanded with victories in wars or annexation, the soldiers were now expected not only to serve in less familiar regions, such as in [[Burma]], but also to make do without the \"foreign service\" remuneration that had previously been their due.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bandyopadhyay|2004|p=171}}, {{Harvnb|Bose|Jalal|2004|pp=70\u201372}}</ref>\n\nA major cause of resentment that arose ten months prior to the outbreak of the rebellion was the General Service Enlistment Act of 25 July 1856. As noted above, men of the Bengal Army had been exempted from overseas service. Specifically, they were enlisted only for service in territories to which they could march. Governor-General [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] saw this as an anomaly, since all sepoys of the Madras and Bombay Armies and the six \"General Service\" battalions of the Bengal Army had accepted an obligation to serve overseas if required. As a result, the burden of providing contingents for active service in Burma, readily accessible only by sea, and [[China]] had fallen disproportionately on the two smaller Presidency Armies. As signed into effect by [[Charles Canning, 1st Earl Canning|Lord Canning]], Dalhousie's successor as Governor-General, the act required only new recruits to the Bengal Army to accept a commitment for general service. However, serving high-caste sepoys were fearful that it would be eventually extended to them, as well as preventing sons following fathers into an army with a strong tradition of family service.<ref>''A Matter of Honour \u2013 an Account of the Indian Army, its Officers and Men'', Philip Mason, {{ISBN|0-333-41837-9}}, p. 261.</ref>\n\nThere were also grievances over the issue of promotions, based on seniority.

This however, merely caused many sepoys to be convinced that the rumours were true and that their fears were justified. Additional rumours started that the paper in the new cartridges, which was glazed and stiffer than the previously used paper, was impregnated with grease.<ref>{{Harvnb|David|2007|p=293}}</ref> In February, a court of inquiry was held at Barrackpore to get to the bottom of these rumours. Native soldiers called as witnesses complained of the paper \"being stiff and like cloth in the mode of tearing\", said that when the paper was burned it smelled of grease, and announced that the suspicion that the paper itself contained grease could not be removed from their minds.<ref>G.

The rebels consisted of three groups: the feudal nobility, rural landlords called ''[[Talukdar|taluqdars]]'', and the peasants. The nobility, many of whom had lost titles and domains under the [[Doctrine of Lapse]], which refused to recognise the adopted children of princes as legal heirs, felt that the Company had interfered with a traditional system of inheritance. Rebel leaders such as [[Nana Sahib]] and the [[Rani of Jhansi]] belonged to this group; the latter, for example, was prepared to accept East India Company supremacy if her adopted son was recognised as her late husband's heir.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bandyopadhyay|2004|p=172}}, {{Harvnb|Bose|Jalal|2004|pp=72\u201373}}, {{Harvnb|Brown|1994|p=92}}</ref> In other areas of central India, such as [[Indore]] and [[Sagar, Madhya Pradesh|Saugar]], where such loss of privilege had not occurred, the princes remained loyal to the Company, even in areas where the sepoys had rebelled.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bandyopadhyay|2004|p=172}}</ref> The second group, the ''taluqdars'', had lost half their landed estates to peasant farmers as a result of the land reforms that came in the wake of annexation of [[Oudh]]. As the rebellion gained ground, the ''taluqdars'' quickly reoccupied the lands they had lost, and paradoxically, in part because of ties of kinship and feudal loyalty, did not experience significant opposition from the peasant farmers, many of whom joined the rebellion, to the great dismay of the British.<ref>{{Harvnb|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p=102}}</ref> It has also been suggested that heavy land-revenue assessment in some areas by the British resulted in many landowning families either losing their land or going into great debt to money lenders, and providing ultimately a reason to rebel; money lenders, in addition to the Company, were particular objects of the rebels' animosity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bose|Jalal|2004|p=72}}, {{Harvnb|Metcalf|1991|ch=2}}, {{Harvnb|Bandyopadhyay|2004|p=173}}</ref> The civilian rebellion was also highly uneven in its geographic distribution, even in areas of north-central India that were no longer under British control.

Of these, the Army of the Bengal Presidency was the largest. Unlike the other two, it recruited heavily from among high-caste Hindus and comparatively wealthy Muslims. The Muslims formed a larger percentage of the 18 irregular cavalry units<ref>{{cite book|first=Boris|last=Mollo|page=54|title=The Indian Army|publisher=Littlehampton Book Services Ltd|year=1981|isbn=978-0713710748}}</ref> within the Bengal Army, whilst Hindus were mainly to be found in the 84 regular infantry and cavalry regiments. The [[sepoy]]s were therefore affected to a large degree by the concerns of the landholding and traditional members of Indian society. In the early years of Company rule, it tolerated and even encouraged the caste privileges and customs within the Bengal Army, which recruited its regular soldiers almost exclusively amongst the landowning [[Brahmin]]s and [[Rajput]]s of the [[Bihar]] and [[Awadh]] regions. These soldiers were known as [[Purbiya]]s. By the time these customs and privileges came to be threatened by modernising regimes in Calcutta from the 1840s onwards, the sepoys had become accustomed to very high ritual status and were extremely sensitive to suggestions that their caste might be polluted.<ref>Seema Alavi ''The Sepoys and the Company'' (Delhi: Oxford University Press) 1998, p. 5.</ref>\n\nThe sepoys also gradually became dissatisfied with various other aspects of army life. Their pay was relatively low and after [[Awadh]] and the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] were annexed, the soldiers no longer received extra pay (''batta'' or ''bhatta'') for service there, because they were no longer considered \"foreign missions\". The junior European officers became increasingly estranged from their soldiers, in many cases treating them as their racial inferiors.  In 1856, a new Enlistment Act was introduced by the Company, which in theory made every unit in the Bengal Army liable to service overseas. Although it was intended to apply only to new recruits, the serving sepoys feared that the Act might be applied retroactively to them as well.<ref>{{cite book|first=Saul|last=David|page=24|title=The Indian Mutiny|isbn=978-0-141-00554-6|date=2003-09-04}}</ref> A high-caste Hindu who travelled in the cramped conditions of a wooden troop ship could not cook his own food on his own fire, and accordingly risked losing caste through ritual pollution.<ref>{{cite book|first=Philip|last=Mason|page=243|title=A Matter of Honour|isbn=978-0-333-41837-6|year=1986}}</ref>\n\n==Onset of the Rebellion==\n[[File:Indian Mutiny Map Showing Position of Troops on 1st May 1857.jpg|300px|thumb|Indian mutiny map showing position of troops on 1 May 1857]]\nSeveral months of increasing tensions coupled with various incidents preceded the actual rebellion. On 26 February 1857 the 19th [[Bengal Native Infantry]] (BNI) regiment became concerned that new cartridges they had been issued were wrapped in paper greased with cow and pig fat, which had to be opened by mouth thus affecting their religious sensibilities. Their Colonel confronted them supported by artillery and cavalry on the parade ground, but after some negotiation withdrew the artillery, and cancelled the next morning's parade.<ref>Memorandum from Lieutenant-Colonel W. St. L. Mitchell (CO of the 19th BNI) to Major A. H.

Informed about Pandey's behaviour Sergeant-Major James Hewson went to investigate, only to have Pandey shoot at him. Hewson raised the alarm.<ref name=\"David 2003 69\">{{Harvnb|David|2003|p=69}}</ref> When his [[adjutant]] Lt.

Publishers, New Delhi.</ref>\n\nGeneral John Hearsey came out to the parade ground to investigate, and claimed later that Mangal Pandey was in some kind of \"religious frenzy\". He ordered the Indian commander of the [[quarter guard]] [[Jemadar]] Ishwari Prasad to arrest Mangal Pandey, but the Jemadar refused.  The quarter guard and other sepoys present, with the single exception of a soldier called [[Shaikh Paltu]], drew back from restraining or arresting Mangal Pandey.  Shaikh Paltu restrained Pandey from continuing his attack.<ref name=\"Malleson\"/><ref>Durendra Nath Sen, p. 50 ''Eighteen Fifty-Seven'', The Publications Division, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Government of India, May 1957.</ref>\n\nAfter failing to incite his comrades into an open and active rebellion, Mangal Pandey tried to take his own life, by placing his musket to his chest and pulling the trigger with his toe.  He managed only to wound himself. He was court-martialled on 6 April, and hanged two days later.\n\nThe Jemadar Ishwari Prasad was sentenced to death and hanged on 22 April.  The regiment was disbanded and stripped of its uniforms because it was felt that it harboured ill-feelings towards its superiors, particularly after this incident.  Shaikh Paltu was promoted to the rank of [[havildar]] in the Bengal Army, but was murdered shortly before the 34th BNI dispersed.<ref>{{cite book|first=Kim A. |last=Wagner|page=97|title=The Great Fear of 1857. Rumours, Conspiracies and the Making of the Indian Uprising|isbn=978-93-81406-34-2}}</ref>\n\nSepoys in other regiments thought these punishments were harsh. The demonstration of disgrace during the formal disbanding helped foment the rebellion in view of some historians. Disgruntled ex-sepoys returned home to Awadh with a desire for revenge.\n\n===Unrest during April 1857===\nDuring April, there was unrest and fires at [[Agra]], [[Allahabad]] and [[Ambala]]. At Ambala in particular, which was a large military cantonment where several units had been collected for their annual musketry practice, it was clear to General Anson, Commander-in-Chief of the Bengal Army, that some sort of rebellion over the cartridges was imminent. Despite the objections of the civilian Governor-General's staff, he agreed to postpone the musketry practice and allow a new drill by which the soldiers tore the cartridges with their fingers rather than their teeth. However, he issued no general orders making this standard practice throughout the Bengal Army and, rather than remain at Ambala to defuse or overawe potential trouble, he then proceeded to [[Shimla|Simla]], the cool \"hill station\" where many high officials spent the summer.\n\nAlthough there was no open revolt at Ambala, there was widespread arson during late April. Barrack buildings (especially those belonging to soldiers who had used the Enfield cartridges) and European officers' bungalows were set on fire.<ref>{{harvnb|Hibbert|1980|pp=73\u201375}}</ref>\n\n===Meerut===\n[[File:The Sepoy revolt at Meerut.jpg|thumb|\"The Sepoy revolt at Meerut,\" from the Illustrated London News, 1857]]\n[[File:1857 mutineers mosque meerut2.jpg|thumb|An 1858 photograph by [[Felice Beato]] of a mosque in Meerut where some of the rebel soldiers may have prayed]]\n\nAt [[Meerut]], a large military cantonment, 2,357 Indian sepoys and 2,038 British soldiers were stationed along with 12 British-manned guns. The station held one of the largest concentrations of British troops in India and this was later to be cited as evidence that the original rising was a spontaneous outbreak rather than a pre-planned plot.<ref name=Mason278>{{Citation|first=Philip|last=Mason|page=278|title=A Matter of Honour \u2013 an Account of the Indian Army|isbn=978-0-333-41837-6|year=1986}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the state of unrest within the Bengal Army was well known, on 24 April Lieutenant Colonel George Carmichael-Smyth, the unsympathetic commanding officer of the [[3rd Bengal Light Cavalry]], ordered 90 of his men to parade and perform firing drills. All except five of the men on parade refused to accept their cartridges. On 9 May, the remaining 85 men were [[court martial]]led, and most were sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment with hard labour. Eleven comparatively young soldiers were given five years' imprisonment. The entire garrison was paraded and watched as the condemned men were stripped of their uniforms and placed in shackles. As they were marched off to jail, the condemned soldiers berated their comrades for failing to support them.\n\nThe next day was Sunday. Some Indian soldiers warned off-duty junior European officers that plans were afoot to release the imprisoned soldiers by force, but the senior officers to whom this was reported took no action. There was also unrest in the city of Meerut itself, with angry protests in the bazaar and some buildings being set on fire. In the evening, most European officers were preparing to attend church, while many of the European soldiers were off duty and had gone into canteens or into the bazaar in Meerut. The Indian troops, led by the 3rd Cavalry, broke into revolt. European junior officers who attempted to quell the first outbreaks were killed by the rebels. European officers' and civilians' quarters were attacked, and four civilian men, eight women and eight children were killed. Crowds in the bazaar attacked off-duty soldiers there. About 50 Indian civilians, some of them officers' servants who tried to defend or conceal their employers, were killed by the sepoys.<ref name=\"David 2003 93\">{{Harvnb|David|2003|p=93}}</ref> While the action of the sepoys in freeing their 85 imprisoned comrades appears to have been spontaneous, some civilian rioting in the city was reportedly encouraged by [[kotwal]] (local police commander) [[Dhan Singh Gurjar]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1980|pp=80\u201385}}</ref>\n\nSome sepoys (especially from the 11th Bengal Native Infantry) escorted trusted British officers and women and children to safety before joining the revolt.<ref>Sir John Kaye & G. B. Malleson: ''The Indian Mutiny of 1857'', (Delhi: Rupa & Co.) reprint 2005, p. 49.</ref> Some officers and their families escaped to [[Rampur, Uttar Pradesh|Rampur]], where they found refuge with the Nawab.\n\nThe British historian Philip Mason notes that it was inevitable that most of the sepoys and sowars from Meerut should have made for Delhi on the night of 10 May. It was a strong walled city located only forty miles away, it was the ancient capital and present seat of the nominal Mughal Emperor and finally there were no British troops in garrison there in contrast to Meerut.<ref name=Mason278/> No effort was made to pursue them.\n\n===Delhi===\n[[File:Massacre of officers by insurgent cavalry at Delhi,.jpg|thumb|Massacre of officers by insurgent cavalry at Delhi]]\n\nEarly on 11 May, the first parties of the 3rd Cavalry reached Delhi. From beneath the windows of the King's apartments in the palace, they called on him to acknowledge and lead them. [[Bahadur Shah II|Bahadur Shah]] did nothing at this point, apparently treating the sepoys as ordinary petitioners, but others in the palace were quick to join the revolt.  During the day, the revolt spread.  European officials and dependents, Indian Christians and shop keepers within the city were killed, some by sepoys and others by crowds of rioters.<ref>Dr. Surendra Nath Sen, pages 71\u201373 \"Eighteen Fifty-Seven\", Publications Division, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Government of India.</ref>\n\n[[File:1858 Delhi flag tower.jpg|thumb|The [[Flagstaff Tower]], Delhi, where the European survivors of the rebellion gathered on 11 May 1857; photographed by [[Felice Beato]]]]\n\nThere were three battalion-sized regiments of Bengal Native Infantry stationed in or near the city. Some detachments quickly joined the rebellion, while others held back but also refused to obey orders to take action against the rebels. In the afternoon, a violent explosion in the city was heard for several miles. Fearing that the arsenal, which contained large stocks of arms and ammunition, would fall intact into rebel hands, the nine British Ordnance officers there had opened fire on the sepoys, including the men of their own guard. When resistance appeared hopeless, they blew up the arsenal. Six of the nine officers survived, but the blast killed many in the streets and nearby houses and other buildings.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1980|pp=98\u2013101}}</ref> The news of these events finally tipped the sepoys stationed around Delhi into open rebellion.  The sepoys were later able to salvage at least some arms from the arsenal, and a magazine two miles (3&nbsp;km) outside Delhi, containing up to 3,000 barrels of gunpowder, was captured without resistance.\n\nMany fugitive European officers and civilians had congregated at the [[Flagstaff Tower]] on the ridge north of Delhi, where telegraph operators were sending news of the events to other British stations.  When it became clear that the help expected from Meerut was not coming, they made their way in carriages to [[Karnal]].  Those who became separated from the main body or who could not reach the Flagstaff Tower also set out for Karnal on foot. Some were helped by villagers on the way; others were killed.\n\nThe next day, Bahadur Shah held his first formal court for many years. It was attended by many excited sepoys. The King was alarmed by the turn events had taken, but eventually accepted the sepoys' allegiance and agreed to give his countenance to the rebellion. On 16 May, up to 50 Europeans who had been held prisoner in the palace or had been discovered hiding in the city were killed by some of the King's servants under a [[peepul tree]] in a courtyard outside the palace.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1980|pp=93\u201395}}</ref><ref>Dalrymple, ''The Last Moghul'', pp. 223\u2013224.</ref>\n\n==Supporters and opposition==\n[[File:Indian revolt of 1857 states map.svg|thumb|250px|States during the rebellion]]\n\nThe news of the events at [[Meerut]] and [[Delhi]] spread rapidly, provoking uprisings among sepoys and disturbances in many districts. In many cases, it was the behaviour of British military and civilian authorities themselves which precipitated disorder. Learning of the fall of Delhi, many Company administrators hastened to remove themselves, their families and servants to places of safety. At [[Agra]], {{convert|160|mi|km}} from Delhi, no less than 6,000 assorted non-combatants converged on the [[Agra Fort|Fort]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1980|pp=152\u2013163}}</ref>\n\nThe military authorities also reacted in disjointed manner. Some officers trusted their sepoys, but others tried to disarm them to forestall potential uprisings. At [[Varanasi|Benares]] and [[Allahabad]], the disarmings were bungled, also leading to local revolts.<ref>Michael Edwardes, ''Battles of the Indian Mutiny'', pp. 52\u201353.</ref>\n\n[[File:Troops of the Native Allies.jpg|thumb|left|''Troops of the Native Allies'' by George Francklin Atkinson, 1859.]]\n\nMost Muslims did not share the rebels' dislike of the British administration<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha Jalal|title=Partisans of Allah|url=https://archive.org/details/partisansofallah00ayes|url-access=registration|year=2008|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02801-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/partisansofallah00ayes/page/129 129]|quote=Nor did most Muslims share the rebels' hatred of the British, even as they deplored the more egregious excesses of colonial rule.}}</ref> and their [[ulema]] could not agree on whether to declare a jihad.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha Jalal|title=Partisans of Allah|url=https://archive.org/details/partisansofallah00ayes|url-access=registration|year=2008|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02801-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/partisansofallah00ayes/page/114 114]\u2013|quote=During the 1857 uprising, the ulema could not agree whether to declare a jihad.}}</ref> There were Islamic scholars such as Maulana [[Muhammad Qasim Nanotvi|Muhammad Qasim Nanautavi]] and Maulana [[Rashid Ahmad Gangohi]] who took up arms against the colonial rule.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha Jalal|title=Partisans of Allah|url=https://archive.org/details/partisansofallah00ayes|url-access=registration|year=2008|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02801-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/partisansofallah00ayes/page/122 122]\u2013123|quote=Maulana Muhammad Qasim Nanautawi (1833-1879), the great Deobandi scholar, fought against the British...Along with Maulana Rashid Ahmad Gangohi (1828-1905), he took up arms when he was presented with clear evidence of English injustice.}}</ref> But a large number of Muslims, among them ulema from both the Sunni and Shia sects, sided with the British.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha Jalal|title=Partisans of Allah|url=https://archive.org/details/partisansofallah00ayes|url-access=registration|year=2008|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02801-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/partisansofallah00ayes/page/130 130]|quote=Many Muslims, including Sunni and Shia ulema, collaborated with the British.}}</ref> Various [[Ahl-i Hadith|Ahl-i-Hadith]] scholars and colleagues of Nanautavi rejected the jihad.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha Jalal|title=Partisans of Allah|url=https://archive.org/details/partisansofallah00ayes|url-access=registration|year=2008|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02801-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/partisansofallah00ayes/page/130 130]\u2013131|quote=Several of Nanautawi's fellow seminarians in Deoband and divines of the Ahl-i-Hadith reputed for their adherence to Sayyid Ahmad Barelvi rejected the jihad.}}</ref> The most influential member of Ahl-i-Hadith ulema in Delhi, Maulana [[Syed Nazeer Husain|Sayyid Nazir Husain Dehlvi]], resisted pressure from the mutineers to call for a jihad and instead declared in favour of British rule, viewing the Muslim-British relationship as a legal contract which could not be broken unless their religious rights were breached.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha Jalal|title=Partisans of Allah|url=https://archive.org/details/partisansofallah00ayes|url-access=registration|year=2008|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02801-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/partisansofallah00ayes/page/131 131]|quote=Maulana Sayyid Nazir Husain Dehalvi was the most influential of the Ahl-Hadith ulema in Delhi at the time of the revolt.

He has also suggested that Sikhs felt insulted by the attitude of sepoys who, in their view, had beaten the [[Khalsa]] only with British help; they resented and despised them far more than they did the British.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2001|p=57}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Looting sikhs.jpg|thumb|''Sikh Troops Dividing the Spoil Taken from Mutineers'', circa 1860]]\n\nThe Sikhs feared reinstatement of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rule in northern India<ref name=Kennedy216>{{Citation| last=Trevaskis| first=Hugh Kennedy| year=1928| title=The Land of Five Rivers: An Economic History of the Punjab from Earliest Times to the Year of Grace 1890| location=London| publisher=Oxford University Press| pages=216\u2013217}}</ref> because they had been persecuted heavily in the past by the Mughal dynasty.\n\nSikh support for the British resulted from grievances surrounding sepoys' perceived conduct during and after the [[Anglo-Sikh Wars]]. Firstly, many Sikhs resented that Hindustanis/[[Purbiya]]s in service of the Sikh state had been foremost in urging the wars, which lost them their independence. Sikh soldiers also recalled that the bloodiest battles of the war, [[Battle of Chillianwala|Chillianwala]] and [[Battle of Ferozeshah|Ferozeshah]], were won by British troops, and they believed that the Hindustani sepoys had refused to meet them in battle. These feelings were compounded when Hindustani sepoys were assigned a very visible role as garrison troops in Punjab and awarded profit-making civil posts in Punjab.<ref name=Kennedy216/>\n\nIn 1857, the Bengal Army had 86,000 men, of which 12,000 were European, 16,000 Sikh and 1,500 Gurkha.

Of these, a substantial contingent from the recently annexed state of Awadh mutinied ''en masse''. Another large contingent from Gwalior also mutinied, even though that state's ruler supported the British. The remainder of the irregular units were raised from a wide variety of sources and were less affected by the concerns of mainstream Indian society.

When European troops were reinforced and began to counterattack, the mutineers were especially handicapped by their lack of centralized command and control. Although the rebels produced some natural leaders such as [[Bakht Khan]], whom the Emperor later nominated as commander-in-chief after his son [[Mirza Mughal]] proved ineffectual, for the most part they were forced to look for leadership to rajahs and princes.

The siege lasted roughly from 1 July to 21 September. However, the encirclement was hardly complete, and for much of the siege the Company forces were outnumbered and it often seemed that it was the Company forces and not Delhi that were under siege, as the rebels could easily receive resources and reinforcements. For several weeks, it seemed likely that disease, exhaustion and continuous sorties by rebels from Delhi would force the Company forces to withdraw, but the outbreaks of rebellion in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] were forestalled or suppressed, allowing the [[Punjab Movable Column]] of British, Sikh and Pakhtun soldiers under [[John Nicholson (general)|John Nicholson]] to reinforce the besiegers on the Ridge on 14 August.<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/mp/2006/10/28/stories/2006102801590100.htm God's Acre].

A large number of the citizens were killed in retaliation for the Europeans and Indian civilians that had been slaughtered by the rebels.  During the street fighting, artillery was set up in the city's main mosque. Neighbourhoods within range were bombarded; the homes of the Muslim nobility that contained innumerable cultural, artistic, literary and monetary riches were destroyed.\n\nThe British soon arrested Bahadur Shah, and the next day the British agent [[William Stephen Raikes Hodson|William Hodson]] had his sons [[Mirza Mughal]], Mirza Khazir Sultan, and grandson Mirza Abu Bakr shot under his own authority at the [[Khooni Darwaza]] (the bloody gate) near Delhi Gate.

Wheeler was not only a veteran and respected soldier but also married to a high-caste Indian woman.  He had relied on his own prestige, and his cordial relations with the [[Nana Sahib]] to thwart rebellion, and took comparatively few measures to prepare fortifications and lay in supplies and ammunition.\n\nThe besieged endured three weeks of the [[Siege of Cawnpore]] with little water or food, suffering continuous casualties to men, women and children.  On 25 June Nana Sahib made an offer of safe passage to Allahabad.  With barely three days' food rations remaining, the British agreed provided they could keep their small arms and that the evacuation should take place in daylight on the morning of the 27th (the Nana Sahib wanted the evacuation to take place on the night of the 26th).  Early in the morning of 27 June, the European party left their entrenchment and made their way to the river where boats provided by the Nana Sahib were waiting to take them to [[Allahabad]].<ref>''The story of Cawnpore: The Indian Mutiny 1857'', Capt.

That very moment someone from the crowd blew a loud bugle, which created disorder and in the ongoing bewilderment, the boatmen jumped off the boats.  The rebels started shooting indiscriminately. Nana Sahib, who was staying in [[Savada Kothi]] ([[Bungalow]]) nearby, was informed about what was happening and immediately came to stop it.<ref>''Kaye's and Malleson's History of the Indian Mutiny''. Longman's, London, 1896.

After the sepoys refused to carry out this order, two Muslim butchers, two Hindu peasants and one of Nana's bodyguards went into The Bibigarh.

With Company forces approaching Cawnpore and some believing that they would not advance if there were no hostages to save, their murders were ordered. Or perhaps it was to ensure that no information was leaked after the fall of Cawnpore. Other historians have suggested that the killings were an attempt to undermine Nana Sahib's relationship with the British.<ref name=autogenerated3>John Harris, The Indian mutiny, Wordsworth military library 2001, p. 92.</ref> Perhaps it was due to fear, the fear of being recognised by some of the prisoners for having taken part in the earlier firings.<ref name=autogenerated4 />\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:1857 hospital wheeler cawnpore2.jpg|Photograph entitled, \"The Hospital in General Wheeler's entrenchment, Cawnpore\".

At the nearby town of [[Fatehpur, Uttar Pradesh|Fatehpur]], a mob had attacked and murdered the local European population.

The British Commissioner resident at [[Lucknow]], [[Henry Montgomery Lawrence|Sir Henry Lawrence]], had enough time to fortify his position inside the Residency compound. The defenders, including loyal sepoys, numbered some 1700 men. The rebels' assaults were unsuccessful, so they began a barrage of artillery and musket fire into the compound. Lawrence was one of the first casualties. He was succeeded by [[John Eardley Inglis]]. The rebels tried to breach the walls with explosives and bypass them via tunnels that led to underground close combat.<ref name=HCRE/>{{rp|486}} After 90 days of siege, the defenders were reduced to 300 loyal sepoys, 350 British soldiers and 550 non-combatants.\n\nOn 25 September, a relief column under the command of [[Sir Henry Havelock]] and accompanied by [[Sir James Outram, 1st Baronet|Sir James Outram]] (who in theory was his superior) fought its way from Cawnpore to Lucknow in a brief campaign, in which the numerically small column defeated rebel forces in a series of increasingly large battles. This became known as 'The First Relief of Lucknow', as this force was not strong enough to break the siege or extricate themselves, and so was forced to join the garrison. In October, another larger army under the new Commander-in-Chief, [[Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde|Sir Colin Campbell]], was finally able to relieve the garrison and on 18 November, they evacuated the defended enclave within the city, the women and children leaving first. They then conducted an orderly withdrawal, firstly to [[Alambagh]] {{convert|4|mi|km}} north where a force of 4,000 were left to construct a fort, then to Cawnpore, where they defeated an attempt by Tantia Tope to recapture the city in the [[Second Battle of Cawnpore]].\n\nIn March 1858, Campbell once again advanced on Lucknow with a large army, meeting up with the force at Alambagh, this time seeking to suppress the rebellion in Awadh.

When the Raja of Jhansi died without a biological male heir in 1853, it was annexed to the [[British Raj]] by the [[Governor-General of India]] under the [[doctrine of lapse]]. His widow Rani Lakshmi Bai, the [[Rani of Jhansi]], protested against the denial of rights of their adopted son. When war broke out, Jhansi quickly became a centre of the rebellion. A small group of Company officials and their families took refuge in [[Jhansi Fort]], and the Rani negotiated their evacuation. However, when they left the fort they were massacred by the rebels over whom the Rani had no control; the Europeans suspected the Rani of complicity, despite her repeated denials.\n\nBy the end of June 1857, the Company had lost control of much of [[Bundelkhand]] and eastern [[Rajasthan]]. The Bengal Army units in the area, having rebelled, marched to take part in the battles for Delhi and Cawnpore. The many princely states that made up this area began warring amongst themselves. In September and October 1857, the Rani led the successful defence of Jhansi against the invading armies of the neighbouring rajas of [[Datia]] and [[Orchha]].\n\nOn 3 February, Sir [[Hugh Rose, 1st Baron Strathnairn|Hugh Rose]] broke the 3-month siege of Saugor. Thousands of local villagers welcomed him as a liberator, freeing them from rebel occupation.<ref>Essential Histories, the Indian Mutiny 1857\u201358, Gregory Fremont-Barnes, Osprey 2007, p. 79.</ref>\n\nIn March 1858, the Central India Field Force, led by Sir Hugh Rose, advanced on and laid siege to Jhansi. The Company forces captured the city, but the Rani fled in disguise.\n\nAfter being driven from Jhansi and [[Kalpi]], on 1 June 1858 Rani Lakshmi Bai and a group of Maratha rebels captured the fortress city of [[Gwalior]] from the [[Scindia]] rulers, who were British allies. This might have reinvigorated the rebellion but the Central India Field Force very quickly advanced against the city. The Rani died on 17 June, the second day of the Battle of Gwalior, probably killed by a carbine shot from the [[8th King's Royal Irish Hussars]] according to the account of three independent Indian representatives. The Company forces recaptured Gwalior within the next three days. In descriptions of the scene of her last battle, she was compared to [[Joan of Arc]] by some commentators.<ref>Lachmi Bai Rani of Jhansi, the Jeanne d'Arc of India (1901), White, Michael (Michael Alfred Edwin), 1866, New York: J.F.

It included not only the present-day Indian and Pakistani Punjabi regions but also the North West Frontier districts bordering Afghanistan.\n\nMuch of the region had been the [[Sikh Empire]], ruled by [[Ranjit Singh]] until his death in 1839. The kingdom had then fallen into disorder, with court factions and the [[Khalsa]] (the Sikh army) contending for power at the Lahore Durbar (court). After two Anglo-Sikh Wars, the entire region was annexed by the East India Company in 1849. In 1857, the region still contained the highest numbers of both European and Indian troops.\n\nThe inhabitants of the Punjab were not as sympathetic to the sepoys as they were elsewhere in India, which limited many of the outbreaks in the Punjab to disjointed uprisings by regiments of sepoys isolated from each other. In some garrisons, notably [[Ferozepore]], indecision on the part of the senior European officers allowed the sepoys to rebel, but the sepoys then left the area, mostly heading for Delhi.<ref name=\"Project Gutenberg\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/w/captcha/question/|title=Project Gutenberg}}</ref> At the most important garrison, that of [[Peshawar]] close to the Afghan frontier, many comparatively junior officers ignored their nominal commander, [[Thomas Reed (British Army officer)|General Reed]], and took decisive action. They intercepted the sepoys' mail, thus preventing their coordinating an uprising, and formed a force known as the \"Punjab Movable Column\" to move rapidly to suppress any revolts as they occurred. When it became clear from the intercepted correspondence that some of the sepoys at Peshawar were on the point of open revolt, the four most disaffected Bengal Native regiments were disarmed by the two British infantry regiments in the cantonment, backed by artillery, on 22 May.

In August, by the [[Government of India Act 1858]], the company was formally dissolved and its ruling powers over India were transferred to the British Crown.<ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/393/ |title = Official, India |work = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1890\u20131923 |accessdate = 30 May 2013}}</ref> A new British government department, the [[India Office]], was created to handle the governance of India, and its head, the [[Secretary of State for India]], was entrusted with formulating Indian policy. The Governor-General of India gained a new title, [[Viceroy of India]], and implemented the policies devised by the India Office. Some former East India Company territories, such as the [[Straits Settlements]], became colonies in their own right. The British colonial administration embarked on a program of reform, trying to integrate Indian higher castes and rulers into the government and abolishing attempts at [[Westernization]]. The Viceroy stopped land grabs, decreed religious tolerance and admitted Indians into civil service, albeit mainly as subordinates.\n\nEssentially the old East India Company bureaucracy remained, though there was a major shift in attitudes. In looking for the causes of the Rebellion the authorities alighted on two things: religion and the economy. On religion it was felt that there had been too much interference with indigenous traditions, both Hindu and Muslim. On the economy it was now believed that the previous attempts by the Company to introduce free market competition had undermined traditional power structures and bonds of loyalty placing the peasantry at the mercy of merchants and money-lenders. In consequence the new [[British Raj]] was constructed in part around a conservative agenda, based on a preservation of tradition and hierarchy.\n\nOn a political level it was also felt that the previous lack of consultation between rulers and ruled had been another significant factor in contributing to the uprising. In consequence, Indians were drawn into government at a local level. Though this was on a limited scale a crucial precedent had been set, with the creation of a new 'white collar' Indian elite, further stimulated by the opening of universities at Calcutta, Bombay and Madras, a result of the Indian Universities Act. So, alongside the values of traditional and ancient India, a new professional middle class was starting to arise, in no way bound by the values of the past. Their ambition can only have been stimulated by Queen Victoria's Proclamation of November 1858, in which it is expressly stated, \"We hold ourselves bound to the natives of our Indian territories by the same obligations of duty which bind us to our other subjects...it is our further will that... our subjects of whatever race or creed, be freely and impartially admitted to offices in our service, the duties of which they may be qualified by their education, ability and integrity, duly to discharge.\"\n\nActing on these sentiments, [[George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon|Lord Ripon]], viceroy from 1880 to 1885, extended the powers of local self-government and sought to remove racial practices in the law courts by the [[Ilbert Bill]]. But a policy at once liberal and progressive at one turn was reactionary and backward at the next, creating new elites and confirming old attitudes. The Ilbert Bill had the effect only of causing a [[white mutiny]] and the end of the prospect of perfect equality before the law. In 1886 measures were adopted to restrict Indian entry into the civil service.\n\n===Military reorganisation===\n[[File:Captain C Scott of the Gen. Sir. Hope Grant's Column, Sepoy Mutiny, 1857.

Metcalf says Stokes undermines the assumption that 1857 was a response to general causes emanating from entire classes of people.  Instead, Stokes argues that 1) those Indians who suffered the greatest relative deprivation rebelled and that 2) the decisive factor in precipitating a revolt was the presence of prosperous magnates who supported British rule.  Stokes also explores issues of economic development, the nature of privileged landholding, the role of moneylenders, the usefulness of classical rent theory, and, especially, the notion of the \"rich peasant\".<ref>Thomas R.

Speaking in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] in July 1857, [[Benjamin Disraeli]] labelled it a 'national revolt' while [[Lord Palmerston]], the Prime Minister, tried to downplay the scope and the significance of the event as a 'mere military mutiny'.<ref>''The Indian Mutiny and Victorian Trauma'' by Christopher Herbert, Princeton University Press, Princeton 2007.</ref> Reflecting this debate, an early historian of the rebellion, Charles Ball, used the word mutiny in his title, but labelled it a \"struggle for liberty and independence as a people\" in the text.<ref>''The History of the Indian Mutiny: Giving a detailed account of the sepoy insurrection in India'' by Charles Ball, The London Printing and Publishing Company, London, 1860.</ref> Historians remain divided on whether the rebellion can properly be considered a war of Indian independence or not,<ref>V.D. Savarkar argues that the rebellion was a war of Indian independence. ''The Indian War of Independence: 1857'' (Bombay: 1947 [1909]). Most historians have seen his arguments as discredited, with one venturing so far as to say, 'It was neither first, nor national, nor a war of independence.' Eric Stokes has argued that the rebellion was actually a variety of movements, not one movement. ''The Peasant Armed'' (Oxford: 1980). See also S. B. Chaudhuri, ''Civil Rebellion in the Indian Mutinies 1857\u20131859'' (Calcutta: 1957).</ref> although it is popularly considered to be one in India. Arguments against include:\n* A united India did not exist at that time in political, cultural, or ethnic terms;\n* The rebellion was put down with the help of other Indian soldiers drawn from the Madras Army, the Bombay Army and the Sikh regiments; 80% of the East India Company forces were Indian;<ref>The Indian Mutiny, Spilsbury Julian, Orion, 2007.</ref>\n* Many of the local rulers fought amongst themselves rather than uniting against the British;\n* Many rebel Sepoy regiments disbanded and went home rather than fight;\n* Not all of the rebels accepted the return of the Mughals;\n* The King of Delhi had no real control over the mutineers;<ref>S&T magazine issue 121 (September 1988), p. 20.</ref>\n* The revolt was largely limited to north and central India.

The reasons advanced are:\n* Even though the rebellion had various causes, most of the rebel sepoys who were able to do so, made their way to Delhi to revive the old [[Mughal empire]] that signified national unity for even the Hindus amongst them;\n* There was a widespread popular revolt in many areas such as [[Awadh]], [[Bundelkhand]] and [[Rohilkhand]]. The rebellion was therefore more than just a military rebellion, and it spanned more than one region;\n* The sepoys did not seek to revive small kingdoms in their regions, instead they repeatedly proclaimed a \"country-wide rule\" of the Mughals and vowed to drive out the British from \"India\", as they knew it then. (The sepoys ignored local princes and proclaimed in cities they took over: ''Khalq Khuda Ki, Mulk Badshah Ka, Hukm Subahdar Sipahi Bahadur Ka'' \u2013 \"the people belong to God, the country to the Emperor and authority to the Sepoy Commandant\"). The objective of driving out \"foreigners\" from not only one's own area but from their conception of the entirety of \"India\", signifies a nationalist sentiment;\n* The mutineers, although some were recruited from outside Oudah, displayed a common purpose.<ref>[[Sitaram Yechury]].

It is from this story that the film ''[[Junoon (1978 film)|Junoon]]'' was later adapted in 1978 by [[Shyam Benegal]].\n* The 1880 novel ''[[The Steam House]]'' by [[Jules Verne]] takes place in the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857.\n* [[Jules Verne]]'s famous character [[Captain Nemo]], originally an Indian prince, fought on the side of the rebels during the rebellion (as stated in Verne's later novel [[The Mysterious Island]]).\n* [[E. M. Forster]]'s 1924 novel ''[[A Passage to India]]'' alludes several times to the Mutiny.\n* [[Flora Annie Steel]]'s novel ''[[On the Face of the Waters]]'' (1896) describes incidents of the Mutiny.\n* The plot of [[H. Beam Piper]]'s science fiction novel [[Uller Uprising]] is based on the events of the Indian Rebellion of 1857.\n* ''Rujub, the juggler'' and ''In Times of Peril: A tale of India'' by [[G.A.

By 1940, the British determined to reduce the [[British Forces Overseas Hong Kong|Hong Kong Garrison]] to only a symbolic size. Air Chief Marshal Sir [[Henry Robert Moore Brooke-Popham|Robert Brooke-Popham]], the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the British [[British Far East Command|Far East Command]] argued that limited reinforcements could allow the garrison to delay a Japanese attack, gaining time elsewhere.{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=}} [[Winston Churchill]] and the general staff named Hong Kong as an ''outpost'' and decided against sending more troops.

The RAF station at Hong Kong's [[Kai Tak Airport]] ([[RAF Kai Tak]]) had only five aeroplanes: two [[Supermarine Walrus]] [[amphibious aircraft]] and three [[Vickers Vildebeest]] torpedo-reconnaissance bombers, flown and serviced by seven officers and 108 airmen. An earlier request for a fighter squadron had been rejected and the nearest fully operational RAF base was in [[Kota Bharu]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], nearly {{convert|2250|km|mi|abbr=on}} away.

On the night of 18 December it was surrounded by troops of the 229th Infantry Regiment. At 07:00 on 19 December, Captain Martin Banfill of the Canadian Medical Corps surrendered the station. Two injured officers of the [[7th Rajput Regiment]] were murdered upon arrival in an ambulance. The Japanese separated the male medical staff from the female (two nurses, whose lives were spared).

A further seven were killed at [[Eucliffe]] and another 36 known victims cannot be placed precisely at one of the three locations (Ridge, Overbays, Eucliffe). Ride, who was present at the surrender, stated later that he saw fifty bodies lying by the road, including six Middlesex men among them.

Although it is the \"most infamous massacre\", it \"has been the hardest to match with records\". Three British and four Chinese nurses were said to have been raped and murdered and one Canadian, Captain Overton Stark Hickey of the RCASC, murdered trying to stop the rapes. Besides the raped nurses, the medical staff suffered two deaths, a doctor shot in the head whilst attempting escape and 25 orderlies of the [[Indian Hospital Corps]] (IHC) and St John Ambulance personnel.{{citation needed|date= November 2017}} The 55 St John victims of the battle of Hong Kong are memorialised at the present headquarters in Hong Kong but since no dates are given on the memorial it is impossible to identify those killed at St Stephen's. Four Chinese servants and one civilian, Tam Cheung Huen, were killed. Tam is the only Chinese victim of this massacre known by name. Among the soldiers receiving treatment at the college, two riflemen were mutilated and murdered and a further 56 men were reportedly bayoneted in their beds. Some of these men may have been Royal Rifles whose deaths are incorrectly reported as occurring elsewhere on 26 December.\n\n====Maryknoll Mission====\nAt least eight men\u2014six of the Middlesex and two [[Royal Engineers]]\u2014were killed after capture at [[Maryknoll Mission]].

On the same morning as the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], forces of the [[Empire of Japan]] attacked the British [[Crown colony]] of [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]]. The attack was in violation of international law as Japan had not declared war against the [[British Empire]]. The Hong Kong garrison consisted of [[British Army during the Second World War|British]], [[Indian Army during World War II|Indian]] and [[Military history of Canada during World War II|Canadian]] units besides Chinese soldiers and conscripts from both within and outside Hong Kong.\n\nLocations which played an important role in setting the pace of military operations during December 1941 include [[Tai Po Road]], the [[Shing Mun Redoubt]] trench and tunnel complex in the [[Gin Drinkers' Line]], [[Devil's Peak, Hong Kong|Devil's Peak]], [[Ma Lau Tong]], [[Lye Moon Passage|Lyemun]] (also spelt as Lye Moon or [[Lei Yue Mun]]), [[North Point]], [[Aldrich Bay]] (Quarry Bay), [[Shau Kei Wan|Shaukiwan]], [[Sai Wan Ho|Saiwan Hill]], [[Wong Nai Chung Gap|Wong Nei Chong Gap]] (Wong Nai Chung Gap), [[Tai Tam Reservoirs|Tytam]] (Tai Tam Gap & Reservoirs), [[Shouson Hill]] and [[Stanley Fort]]. Coastal defence batteries including those at [[Stonecutters Island]], [[Pak Sha Wan]], [[Lyemun fort]], Saiwan, [[Mount Collinson]], [[Mount Parker, Hong Kong|Mount Parker]], Belchers, [[Mount Davis, Hong Kong|Mount Davis]], Jubilee Hill, Bokara, and Stanley provided artillery support for ground operations until they were put out of action or surrendered.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nicholson|first1=K.

On 21 October 1938 the Japanese occupied [[Guangzhou|Canton]] (Guangzhou) and Hong Kong was surrounded.{{sfn|Fung|2005|p=129}} British defence studies concluded that Hong Kong would be extremely hard to defend in the event of a Japanese attack, but in the mid-1930s work began on improvements to defences including along the [[Gin Drinkers' Line]]. By 1940, the British determined to reduce the [[British Forces Overseas Hong Kong|Hong Kong Garrison]] to only a symbolic size. Air Chief Marshal Sir [[Henry Robert Moore Brooke-Popham|Robert Brooke-Popham]], the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the British [[British Far East Command|Far East Command]] argued that limited reinforcements could allow the garrison to delay a Japanese attack, gaining time elsewhere.{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=}} [[Winston Churchill]] and the general staff named Hong Kong as an ''outpost'' and decided against sending more troops. In September 1941, they reversed their decision and argued that additional reinforcements would provide a military deterrent against the Japanese and reassure Chinese leader [[Chiang Kai-shek]] that Britain was serious about defending the colony.{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It is uncertain whether they were killed in action, or murdered after capture.\n\n====St Stephen's College====\n{{main|St. Stephen's College massacre}}\nThe massacre perpetrated at [[St. Stephen's College, Hong Kong|St Stephen's College]] is the least well known.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Only thirteen victims can be confirmed at the location but reports and estimates put the real number as high as 99. The names of all the reported victims may never be known. Between 75 and 150 bodies were cremated by the victors in the aftermath of the battle but this total includes the victims of the fighting around Stanley Fort, such as the men of 965 Defence Battery. Although it is the \"most infamous massacre\", it \"has been the hardest to match with records\". Three British and four Chinese nurses were said to have been raped and murdered and one Canadian, Captain Overton Stark Hickey of the RCASC, murdered trying to stop the rapes. Besides the raped nurses, the medical staff suffered two deaths, a doctor shot in the head whilst attempting escape and 25 orderlies of the [[Indian Hospital Corps]] (IHC) and St John Ambulance personnel.{{citation needed|date= November 2017}} The 55 St John victims of the battle of Hong Kong are memorialised at the present headquarters in Hong Kong but since no dates are given on the memorial it is impossible to identify those killed at St Stephen's. Four Chinese servants and one civilian, Tam Cheung Huen, were killed. Tam is the only Chinese victim of this massacre known by name. Among the soldiers receiving treatment at the college, two riflemen were mutilated and murdered and a further 56 men were reportedly bayoneted in their beds. Some of these men may have been Royal Rifles whose deaths are incorrectly reported as occurring elsewhere on 26 December.\n\n====Maryknoll Mission====\nAt least eight men\u2014six of the Middlesex and two [[Royal Engineers]]\u2014were killed after capture at [[Maryknoll Mission]]. Four members of the 8th Coastal Regiment RA may have been killed here as well; estimates of the number of men murdered vary from 11 to 16.\n\n====Brick Hill====\nTwenty-six prisoners are believed to have been killed after the fighting for [[Brick Hill (Hong Kong)|Brick Hill]] but some of these may have died in the fight, including some of the seventeen men of the Heavy Anti-Aircraft, [[Hong Kong and Singapore Royal Artillery]] (HKSRA) known to have died there. Most of the soldiers here murdered were Muslims, including one religious teacher.\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Casualties===\n<!--[[File:Sai Wan War Cemetery 1.jpg|thumb|[[Sai Wan War Cemetery]]]]-->\nThe Japanese had at least 1,895 men killed of an estimated 6,000 casualties. Allied casualties were 1,111 men killed, 1,167 missing and 1,362 wounded.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=214}} Allied dead, including British, Canadian and Indian soldiers, were eventually interred at [[Sai Wan War Cemetery|Sai Wan Military Cemetery]] and the [[Stanley Military Cemetery]]. C Force casualties in the battle were 23 officers and 267 other ranks killed or died of wounds, including five officers and 16 other ranks of the brigade headquarters, seven officers and 123 men of the Royal Rifles and 11 officers and 128 men of the Winnipeg Grenadiers. C Force also had 28 officers and 465 men wounded. Some of the dead were murdered by Japanese soldiers during or after surrender. Japanese soldiers committed a number of atrocities on 19 December, when the aid post at the Salesian Mission near Sau Ki Wan was overrun.{{sfn|Stacey|1956|p=488}} A total of 1,528 soldiers, mainly [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] (predominantly Indians and Canadians), are either buried or commemorated there. There are also graves of other Allied combatants who died in the region during the war, including some Dutch sailors who were re-interred in Hong Kong after the war.\n\nThe nearby Sai Wan Battery, with buildings constructed as far back as 1890, housed the Depot and Record Office of the [[Hong Kong Military Service Corps]] for nearly four decades after the war. The barracks were handed over to the government in 1985 and were subsequently converted into [[Lei Yue Mun Park and Holiday Village]].\n\nAt the end of February 1942, The Japanese government stated that numbers of [[prisoners of war]] in Hong Kong were: British 5,072, Canadian 1,689, Indian 3,829, others 357, a total of 10,947.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=L-VXAAAAYAAJ&q=%225072+Canadian+1689+Indian+3829+others+357%22&dq=%225072+Canadian+1689+Indian+3829+others+357%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=5lKDT_v4Csyu8QP9uomTBg&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAQ Official Report of the Debates of The House of Commons of The Dominion Of Canada (Volume 2) 1942 (page 1168)]</ref> They were sent to:\n* [[Sham Shui Po Barracks|Sham Shui Po POW Camp]]\n* [[Argyle Street Camp]] for officers\n* [[North Point Camp]] primarily for Canadians and Royal Navy\n* [[Ma Tau Chung]] Camp for Indian soldiers\n* [[Yokohama Camp]] in Japan\n* [[Fukuoka Camp]] in Japan\n* [[Osaka Camp]] in Japan\n\nOf the Canadians captured during the battle, 267 subsequently perished in Japanese prisoner of war camps, mainly due to neglect and abuse. In December 2011, Toshiyuki Kato, Japan's parliamentary vice-minister for foreign affairs, apologised for the mistreatment to a group of Canadian veterans of the Battle of Hong Kong.{{sfn|AP|2011|p=2}}\n\nCivilians were interned at the [[Stanley Internment Camp]]. Initially, there were 2,400 internees although this number was reduced, by repatriations during the war. Interned persons who died and prisoners executed by the Japanese are buried in Stanley Military Cemetery.\n\n===Subsequent operations===\n\n{{Main|Japanese occupation of Hong Kong}}\n{{See also|British Army Aid Group|Hong Kong Volunteer Company}}\n\n[[File:Dongjianggu.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Dongjiang guerillas fighting in [[trench warfare|trenches]]}}]]\n[[Isogai Rensuke]] became the first Japanese governor of Hong Kong. This ushered in the three years and eight months of Imperial Japanese administration. During the over three and a half years of occupation by the Japanese, an estimated 10,000 Hong Kong civilians were executed, while many others were tortured, raped, or mutilated.{{sfn|Carroll|2007|p=123}} The [[Indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories (Hong Kong)|local population in the rural New Territories]], a mix of Hakka, Cantonese and other Han Chinese groups, waged a guerrilla war with limited success. The [[Japanese Occupation of Hong Kong#Anti-Japanese resistance|resistance groups]] were known as the Gangjiu and Dongjiang forces. The Japanese razed several villages in reprisal; the guerillas fought until the end of the Japanese occupation. General Takashi Sakai, who led the invasion of Hong Kong and served as governor for some time, was tried as a war criminal and executed by a firing squad in 1946.{{citation needed|date= November 2017}}\n\n===Awards===\n[[File:Hong Kong Park statue.jpg|thumb|150px|{{centre|Statue of an anonymous World War I soldier from statuary collection of [[Eu Tong Sen]].

The men had been captured and were in the process of planning a mass escape by British forces.

The shield in the colonial [[Emblem of Hong Kong]] granted in 1959, featured the battlement design to commemorate the defence of Hong Kong during the Second World War. This Coat of Arms was in place until 1997, when it was replaced by the regional emblem. After the war, Lei Yue Mun Fort became a training ground for the British Forces until 1987, when it was vacated. In view of its historical significance and unique architectural features, the former [[Urban Council]] decided in 1993 to conserve and develop the fort into the [[Hong Kong Museum of Coastal Defence]].\n\n[[File:HK Edinburgh Place \u724c\u533e City Hall Memorial Garden and Shrine.JPG|upright|thumb|{{centre|Commemorative plaque at the entrance to ''Memorial Gardens'' at [[Hong Kong City Hall]]}}]]\nThe memorial garden at [[Hong Kong City Hall]] commemorates those who died in Hong Kong during World War II.\n[[File:The City Hall Memorial Garden Overview 2014.jpg|The memorial garden at Hong Kong City Hall|thumb]]\n[[File:The City Hall Memorial Garden Memorial Shrine 2012.jpg|Shrine to the war dead in the memorial garden at Hong Kong City Hall|thumb]]\n\n==Orders of battle==\n* '''{{army|Empire of Japan}}'''\n** [[Twenty-Third Army (Japan)]] (Lieutenant-General T.

Marketing textbooks are firm on the point that any differentiation must be valued by buyers<ref name=\"kotler\"/> (a differentiation attempt that is not perceived does not count).  The term [[unique selling proposition]] refers to [[advertising]] to communicate a product's differentiation.<ref>[[Rosser Reeves|Reeves, Rosser]] (1961) The Reality of Advertising. {{ISBN|978-0982694145}}</ref>\n\nIn [[economics]], successful product differentiation leads to [[competitive advantage]] and is inconsistent with the conditions for [[perfect competition]], which include the requirement that the products of competing firms should be [[Substitute good|perfect substitutes]]. There are three types of product differentiation:\n\n# Simple: based on a variety of characteristics\n# Horizontal: based on a single characteristic but consumers are not clear on quality\n# Vertical: based on a single characteristic and consumers are clear on its quality<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Pepall\n  | first = Lynne\n  |author2=Daniel J.

The physical product need not change, but it may.  Differentiation is due to buyers perceiving a difference; hence, causes of differentiation may be functional aspects of the product or service, how it is [[distribution (business)|distributed]] and marketed, or who buys it.  The major sources of product differentiation are as follows.\n*Differences in [[Quality (business)|quality]] which are usually accompanied by differences in price\n*Differences in functional features or design\n*[[Ignorance]] of buyers regarding the essential characteristics and qualities of goods they are purchasing\n*Sales [[Promotion (marketing)|promotion]] activities of sellers and, in particular, advertising\n*Differences in [[Supply (economics)|availability]] (e.g. timing and location).\n\nThe [[Goal|objective]] of differentiation is to develop a [[positioning (marketing)|position]] that potential customers see as unique. The term is used frequently when dealing with [[freemium]] business models, in which businesses market a free and paid version of a given product. Given they target the [[Price discrimination|same group of customers]], it is imperative that free and paid versions be effectively differentiated.\n\nDifferentiation primarily affects performance through reducing directness of competition: As the product becomes more different, categorization becomes more difficult and hence draws fewer comparisons with its competition.  A successful product differentiation strategy will move your product from competing based primarily on [[price]] to competing on non-price factors (such as product characteristics, distribution strategy, or promotional variables).\n\nMost people would say that the implication of differentiation is the possibility of charging a [[price premium]]; however, this is a gross simplification.  If customers value the firm's offer, they will be less sensitive to aspects of competing offers; price may not be one of these aspects.  Differentiation makes customers in a given segment have a lower sensitivity to other features (non-price) of the product.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sharp | first1 = Byron | last2 = Dawes | first2 = John | year = 2001 | title = What is Differentiation and How Does it Work? | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1362/026725701323366809 | journal = [[Journal of Marketing Management]] | volume = 17 | issue = 7-8| pages = 739\u201359 | doi = 10.1362/026725701323366809 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[Edward Chamberlin]]\u2019s (1933) seminal work on [[monopolistic]] competition mentioned the theory of differentiation that says that for the available products within the same industry, customers may have different preferences.

Hence, it depends on their perception the extent of product differentiation. Even until 1999, the consequences of these concepts were not well understood. In fact, Miller (1986) proposed marketing and [[innovation]] as two differentiation strategies, which was supported by some scholars like Lee and Miller (1999).

He noticed in the late sixties that photographers were using cameras with wide-angle lenses. He did not like these photographs because they looked somewhat distorted. While working on a painting of a living room and terrace in Los Angeles, he took Polaroid shots of the living room and glued them together, not intending for them to be a composition on their own. On looking at the final composition, he realised it created a narrative, as if the viewer moved through the room. He began to work more with photography after this discovery and stopped painting for a while to exclusively pursue this new technique. Frustrated with the limitations of photography and its 'one-eyed' approach, however,<ref>Hockney on Art \u2013 Paul Joyce {{ISBN|1-4087-0157-X}}</ref> he returned to painting.\n\n===Other technology===\nIn December 1985 Hockney used the [[Quantel Paintbox]], a computer program that allowed the artist to sketch directly onto the screen.

He noticed in the late sixties that photographers were using cameras with wide-angle lenses. He did not like these photographs because they looked somewhat distorted. While working on a painting of a living room and terrace in Los Angeles, he took Polaroid shots of the living room and glued them together, not intending for them to be a composition on their own. On looking at the final composition, he realised it created a narrative, as if the viewer moved through the room. He began to work more with photography after this discovery and stopped painting for a while to exclusively pursue this new technique. Frustrated with the limitations of photography and its 'one-eyed' approach, however,<ref>Hockney on Art \u2013 Paul Joyce {{ISBN|1-4087-0157-X}}</ref> he returned to painting.\n\n===Other technology===\nIn December 1985 Hockney used the [[Quantel Paintbox]], a computer program that allowed the artist to sketch directly onto the screen.

{"title_page": "Indo-European cosmogony", "text_new": "The '''Indo-European cosmogony''' refers to the reconstructed [[cosmogony]] of the [[Proto-Indo-European mythology]].\n\nThe [[Comparative method|comparative analysis]] of different Indo-European tales has led scholars to reconstruct an original Proto-Indo-European [[creation myth]] involving twin brothers, *''{{PIE|Manu-}}'' (\"Man\") and *''{{PIE|Yemo-}}'' (\"Twin\"), as the progenitors of the world and mankind, and a hero named ''*{{PIE|Trito}}'' (\"Third\") who ensured the continuity of the original sacrifice.\n\nAlthough some thematic parallels can be made with Ancient Near East (the primordial couple [[Adam and Eve]]), and even Polynesian or South American legends, the linguistic correspondences found in descendant [[cognate]]s of ''*Manu'' and ''*Yemo'' make it very likely that the myth discussed here has a Proto-Indo-European (PIE) origin.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1975|p=124}}\n\n== Historiography ==\nHermann G\u00fcntert, stressing philological parallels between the Germanic and Indo-Iranian texts, argued in 1923 for an inherited Indo-European motif of the creation of the world from the sacrifice and dismemberment of a primordial [[Androgyny|androgyne]].{{Sfn|Lincoln|1975|p=122}}\n\nFollowing a first paper on the cosmogonical legend of Manu and Yemo, published simultaneously with [[Jaan Puhvel]] in 1975 (who pointed out the Roman reflex of the story), [[Bruce Lincoln]] assembled the initial part of the myth with the legend of the third man Trito in a single ancestral motif.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1976|p=42\u201343}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=134\u2013135}}{{Sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|p=435\u2013436}}\n\nSince the 1970s, the reconstructed motifs of Manu and Yemo, and to a lesser extent that of Trito, have been generally accepted among scholars.<ref>See: {{harvnb|Puhvel|1987|pp=285\u2013287}}; {{harvnb|Mallory|Adams|2006|pp=435\u2013436}}; {{harvnb|Anthony|2007|pp=134\u2013135}}. {{harvnb|West|2007}} agrees with the reconstructed motif of Manu and Yemo, although he notes that interpretations of the myths of [[Trita]] and [[Fereydun|Thra\u0113tona]] are debated. According to {{Harvard citation no brackets|Polom\u00e9|1986}}, \"some elements of the [Scandinavian myth of Ymir] are distinctively Indo-Europeans\", but the reconstruction of the creation myth of the first Man and his Twin proposed by {{Harvard citation no brackets|Lincoln|1975}} \"makes too unprovable assumptions to account for the fundamental changes implied by the Scandinavian version\".</ref>\n\n== Myths ==\n=== Primordial state ===\nThe basic Indo-European root for the divine creation is *''d\u02b0eh\u2081'', \"to set in place, lay down, or establish\", from which the Vedic creator god Dh\u0101tr derive.{{Sfn|West|2007|p=354}} The concept of the [[World egg|Cosmic Egg]], symbolizing the primordial state from which the universe arises, is also found in many Indo-European creation myths.{{Sfn|Leeming|2009|p=144|ps=: \"The cosmic egg found here is also found in many Indo-European mythologies.\"}} A similar depiction of the appearance of the universe before the act of creation is given in the Vedic, Germanic and, at least partly, in the Greek tradition.{{Sfn|West|2007|pp=355\u2013356}}\n\nThe ''[[Rigveda]]'' tells us that \"neither non-being was nor being was at that time; there was not the air, nor the heaven beyond it... Neither death was nor the immortal then, nor was there the mark of night and day...\" while \"...earth was not, nor heaven above, nor tree... nor mountain there was, not a single star, nor the sun shone, nor the moon gave light, nor the bright sea...\" in the ''[[Wessobrunn Prayer|Wessobrun]]'' prayer, and the author of the ''[[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1]]'' writes that \"...there was not sand nor sea nor the cool waves; earth was nowhere nor heaven above; [[Ginnungagap|Ginnunga Gap]] there was, but grass nowhere...\"{{Sfn|Polom\u00e9|1986|p=473}}{{Sfn|West|2007|pp=355\u2013356}}\n\nAlthough the idea of a created world is untypical of early Greek thinking, similar descriptions have been highlighted in [[Aristophanes]]'s [[The Birds (play)|''The Birds'']]: \"...there was [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chasm]] and Night and dark [[Erebus|Erebos]] at first, and broad [[Tartarus]], but earth nor air nor heaven there was...\" The analogy between the Greek ''\u03a7\u1f01\u03bf\u03c2'' (\"Chaos, [[Rift|Chasm]]\") and the Norse ''[[Ginnungagap]]'' (\"Gaping abyss\") has also been noted by scholars.{{Sfn|West|2007|p=356}} The importance of ''heat'' in Germanic creation myths has also been compared with similar Indian beliefs emphasized in the Vedic hymn on \"cosmic heat\".{{Sfn|Polom\u00e9|1986|p=474}}\n\n=== Cosmic sacrifice ===\nThe first [[Human|man]] Manu and his [[giant]] twin Yemo are crossing the [[cosmos]], accompanied by the primordial cow. To create the world, Manu [[Fratricide|sacrifices his brother]] and, with the help of heavenly deities (the [[Dyeus|Sky-Father]], the [[Perkwunos|Storm-God]] and the [[Divine twins|Divine Twins]]),{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=134\u2013135}}{{Sfn|West|2007|p=357}} forges both the natural elements and [[Human|human beings]] from his twin's remains.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1975|p=139}}{{Sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|p=435\u2013436}}\n\nManu thus becomes the first priest after initiating sacrifice as the primordial condition for the world order. His deceased brother Yemo turns into the first king as social classes emerge from his anatomy (priesthood from his head, the warrior class from his breast and arms, and the commoners from his sexual organs and legs).{{Sfn|Lincoln|1975|p=139}}\n\nAlthough the European and Indo-Iranian versions differ on this matter, the primeval cow was most likely sacrificed in the original myth, giving birth to the other animals and vegetables.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1975|p=144}} Yemo may have become the King of the [[Otherworld]], the realm of the dead, as the first mortal to die in the primordial sacrifice, a role suggested by  the [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] and, to a lesser extent, in the Germanic, Greek and Celtic traditions.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1991|p=41}}{{Sfn|Jackson|2002|p=81}}{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=439}}\n\n=== First Warrior ===\nTo the third man Trito, the celestial gods offer cattle as a divine gift, which is stolen by a three-headed [[Proto-Indo-European mythology#Dragon or Serpent|serpent]] named *''{{PIE|Ng\u02b7hi}}'' (\"serpent\"; and the Indo-European root for [[Affirmation and negation|negation]]).{{Sfn|Lincoln|1976|p=51}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=134\u2013135}}\n\nTrito first suffers at his hands, but fortified by an intoxicating drink and aided by a helper-god (the [[Perkwunos|Storm-God]] or ''*H\u2090ner'', \"Man\"),{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=134\u2013135}}{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|p=437}} together they go to a cave or a mountain, and the hero finally manages to overcome the monster. Trito then gives the recovered cattle back to a priest for it to be properly sacrificed.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=134\u2013135}}{{snf|Mallory|Adams|1997|p=138}} He is now the first warrior, maintaining through his heroic deeds the cycle of mutual giving between gods and mortals.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1976|p=63\u201364}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=134\u2013135}}\n\n== Interpretations ==\n\n=== Three Functions ===\nAccording to Lincoln, Manu and Yemo seem to be the protagonists of \"a myth of the sovereign function, establishing the model for later priests and kings\", while the legend of Trito should be seen as \"a myth of the warrior function, establishing the model for all later men of arms\".{{Sfn|Lincoln|1976|p=63\u201364}} He has thus interpreted the narrative as an expression of the priests's and kings's attempt to justify their role as indispensable for the preservation of the cosmos, and therefore as essential for the organization of society.{{Sfn|Arvidsson|2006|p=302}} The motif indeed recalls the [[Georges Dum\u00e9zil|Dum\u00e9zilian]] [[Trifunctional hypothesis|tripartition]] of the cosmos between the priest (in both his magical and legal aspects), the warrior (the Third Man), and the herder (the cow).{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=134\u2013135}}\n\n=== Primeval hermaphrodite ===\nSome scholars have proposed that the primeval being Yemo was depicted as a two-folded [[hermaphrodite]] rather than a twin brother of Manu, both forming indeed a pair of complementary beings entwined together.{{Sfn|West|2007|p=358}}{{Sfn|Dandekar|1979|p=}} The Germanic names ''[[Ymir]]'' and ''Tuisto'' were understood as ''twin'', ''bisexual'' or ''hermaphrodite'', and some myths give a sister to the Vedic Yama, also called Yam\u012b (\"Twin\").{{Sfn|Puhvel|1987|p=63}}{{Sfn|Mallory|Adams|1997|p=129}}{{Sfn|West|2007|pp=356\u2013357}} The primordial being may therefore have self-sacrificed,{{Sfn|Dandekar|1979|p=}} or have been divided in two, a male half and a female half, embodying a prototypal separation of the sexes that continued the primordial union of the Sky Father ([[Dyeus|Dy\u0113us]]) with the Mother Earth ([[Dh\u00e9\u01f5h\u014dm]]).{{Sfn|West|2007|p=358}}\n\n=== Cattle-raiding myth ===\nThe story of Trito served as a model for later [[cattle raiding]] epic myths and most likely as a moral justification for the practice of raiding among Indo-European peoples. In their legends, Trito is portrayed as only taking back what rightfully belongs to his people, those who sacrifice properly to the gods.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1976|p=63\u201364}}{{snf|Mallory|Adams|1997|page=138}} Although cattle raiding is a common theme found in every societies keeping cattle, it was particularly popular among Indo-European peoples, as attested by the legends of [[Indra]] and the [[Panis]], [[Beowulf]] and [[Grendel]], the quest of Queen [[Medb]] for the Bull, or [[Odysseus]] hunting down the cattle of [[Helios]].{{Sfn|Lincoln|1976|p=44}}\n\nThe myth has been variously interpreted as a cosmic conflict between a heavenly hero and an earthly serpent; as a depiction of the male fellowships' struggle to protect society against external evil; or as an Indo-European victory over non-Indo-European people, the monster symbolizing the aboriginal thief or usurper.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1976|pp=58, 62}}{{snf|Mallory|Adams|1997|page=138}}{{Sfn|Arvidsson|2006|p=302}} The Vedic serpent [[Vishvarupa|Vi\u015bvar\u016bpa]] is indeed described as a *''d\u0101sa'', an aboriginal inhabitant who is inimical to the Indo-European invaders; the Iranian serpent [[Zahhak|A\u017ei Dah\u0101ka]] carries in his name the pejorative suffix ''-ka''; and the Latin inimical giant [[Cacus|C\u0101cus]] is depicted as a non-Indo-European aborigine (''incola''), hostile to Romans and Greeks alike.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1976|pp=52, 57}} According to [[Martin Litchfield West|Martin L. West]], the Proto-Indo-European name ''*Trito'' (\"Third\") may have been a \"poetic or hieratic code-name, fully comprehensible only with specialized knowledge\".{{Sfn|West|2007|p=260}}\n\n== Evidence ==\n\n=== Linguistic ===\n\n==== Manu and Yemo ====\n[[Cognate]]s deriving from the Proto-Indo-European First Priest ''*Manu'' (\"[[Human|Man]]\", \"ancestor of mankind\") include the Indic [[Manu (Hinduism)|M\u00e1nu]], legendary first man in [[Hinduism]], and Man\u0101v\u012b, his sacrificed wife; the Germanic [[Mannus]] (from [[Proto-Germanic language|Germ.]] ''*Manwaz''), mythical ancestor of the [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic tribes]]; and the Persian Man\u016b\u0161\u010dihr (from [[Avestan|Av.]] ''Man\u016b\u0161.\u010di\u03b8ra'', \"son of Manu\u0161\"), [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] high priest of the 9th century AD.{{Sfn|Mallory|Adams|1997|p=367}}{{Sfn|Lincoln|1975|pp=134\u2013136}}\n\nFrom the name of the sacrificed First King ''*Yemo'' (\"Twin\") derive the Indic [[Yama]], god of death and the underworld; the [[Avestan]] [[Jamshid|Yima]], king of the [[Golden Age|golden age]] and guardian of [[Otherworld|hell]]; the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] [[Ymir]] (from [[Proto-Germanic language|Germ.]] *''Yumiy\u00e1z''), ancestor of the giants ([[J\u00f6tunn|''j\u00f6tnar'']]); and most likely [[Romulus and Remus|Remus]] (from Proto-Latin ''*Yemos''), killed in the [[Founding of Rome|Roman foundation myth]] by his twin brother [[Romulus|R\u014dmulus]].{{Sfn|Lincoln|1975|p=129}}{{Sfn|Puhvel|1987|pp=285\u2013289}}{{Sfn|Mallory|Adams|1997|pp=129\u2013130}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=134\u2013135}} Latvian ''jumis'' (\"double fruit\"), Latin ''geminus'' (\"twin\") and [[Middle Irish]] ''emuin'' (\"twin\") are also linguistically related.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1975|p=129}}{{Sfn|Puhvel|1987|p=289}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;

In the European reflexes, the cow (represented by a she-wolf in the Roman myth) serves only as a provider of milk and care for the twins before the creation.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1975|p=139}} This divergence may be explained by the cultural differences between the Indo-Iranian and European branches of the Indo-European family, with the former still strongly influenced by [[pastoralism]], and the latter much more agricultural, perceiving the cow mainly as a source of milk.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1975|pp=142\u2013143}} According to Lincoln, the Indo-Iranian version of the creation myth best preserves the ancestral motif, since they lived closer to the original Proto-Indo-European pastoral way of life.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1975|p=144}}\n\nBoth the ''Rigveda'' and the ''Younger Avesta'' depict the slaying of a three-headed serpent by a hero named ''[[Trita]] \u0100ptya'' or ''[[Fereydun|Thra\u0113ta(ona)]] \u0100thwya'' in order to recover cattle or women.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1976|p=|pp=47\u201348}}{{Sfn|West|2007|p=260}} The two names are cognates deriving from PIE ''*Trito'', and the Indo-Iranian ''*Atpya'' may refer to the name of a family of heroes.

The association of M\u00e1nu with the ritual of sacrifice is so strong that those who do not sacrifice are named ''amanu\u1e63\u0101\u1e25'', which means \"not belonging to M\u00e1nu\", \"unlike M\u00e1nu\", or \"inhuman\".{{Sfn|Lincoln|1975|pp=134\u2013135}} The Song of [[Purusha|Puru\u1e63a]] (another word meaning \"man\") tells how the body parts of the sacrificed primeval man led to the creation of the [[cosmos]] (the heaven from his head, the air from his navel, the earth from his legs) and the Hindu [[Caste system in India|castes]] (the upper parts becoming the upper castes and the lower parts the commoners).{{Sfn|Puhvel|1987|p=286}}{{Sfn|Fortson|2004|p=27}}{{Sfn|West|2007|p=357}} In the later ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana|\u015aatapatha Br\u0101hmana]]'', both a primordial bull and M\u00e1nu's wife Man\u0101v\u012b are sacrificed by the demi-gods [[Asura]]s. According to Lincoln, this could represent an independent variant of the original myth, with the figure of Yama laying behind that of Man\u0101v\u012b.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1975|pp=133\u2013134}}\n\nInvoked in funeral hymns of the ''[[Rigveda]]'', [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]] is depicted as the first man to die, the one who established the path towards death after he freely chose his own departure from life.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1991|p=|pp=32\u201333}} Although his realm was originally associated with feasting, beauty and happiness, Yama was gradually portrayed as a horrific being and the ruler of the [[Otherworld]] in the epic and [[Puranas|puranic]] traditions.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1991|p=|pp=32\u201333}} Some scholars have equated this abandonment (or transcendence) of his own body by Yama with the sacrifice of [[Purusha|Puru\u1e63a]].{{Sfn|Lincoln|1975|p=133}}{{Sfn|Puhvel|1987|p=286}} In a motif shared with the Iranian tradition, touched in the ''Rigveda'' and told in later traditions, Yama and his twin sister Yam\u012b are presented as the children of the sun-god Vivasvat. Discussing the [[Incest taboo|advisability]] of the primordial incest in a primordial context, Yam\u012b insists to have a [[sexual intercourse]] with her brother Yama, who rejects it, thus forgoing his role as the creator of mankind.{{Sfn|Puhvel|1987|p=63}}\n\nIn the Vedic tradition, [[Trita|Trita \u0100ptya]] and [[Indra]] maintain a relationship of mutual assistance, Trita giving [[Soma (drink)|soma]] to the god so that he can, in return, provide help to the hero in his fight against the monster [[Vishvarupa|Vi\u015bvar\u016bpa]].{{Sfn|Lincoln|1976|p=50}}{{snf|Mallory|Adams|1997|page=138}} Trita confronts the three-headed dragon (''\u00e1hi-''), and kills him to let the cows go out.

Man\u016b\u0161\u010dihr is described in the ''[[Bundahishn|Greater Bun-dahi\u0161n\u012bh]]'' as the ancestor of all ''M\u014dpats'' (\"High Priests\") of [[Parsis|Pars]], and it has been proposed that ''*Manu\u0161'' was originally regarded as the First Priest among pre-[[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] tribes.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1975|p=136}}[[File:Jamshid_(The_Shahnama_of_Shah_Tahmasp).png|alt=|thumb|218x218px|The Iranian mythical king [[Jamshid|Yima]]. c. 1522.]]In pre-Zoroastrian Iran, [[Jamshid|Yima]] was seen as the first king and first mortal. The original myth of creation was indeed condemned by [[Zoroaster|Zarathustra]], who makes mention of it in the ''[[Avesta]]'' as the two spirits that \"appeared in the beginning as two twins in a dream ... (and) who first met and instituted life and non-life\".{{Sfn|Lincoln|1975|pp=129\u2013130}} Yima in particular is depicted as the first to distribute portions of the cow for consumption,{{Sfn|West|2007|pp=357\u2013358}} and therefore explicitly condemned for having introduced the eating of meat.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1991|p=38}} After a brief reign on earth, the king Yima was said in a later tradition to be deprived of his triple royal nimbus, which embodied the three social classes in Iranian myths. [[Mithra]] receives the part of the Priest, [[Fereydun|Thra\u0113tona]] that of the Warrior, and [[Gershasp (gladiator)|K\u0259r\u0259s\u0101spa]] that of the Commoner.

The story, giving a central position to the new religious leader, is once again probably the result of a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] reformation, and Yima may have been the original ruler of the realm of the dead.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1991|p=38}}\n\nIn the ''Younger Avestan'', the stolen cattle of ''*Trito'' was replaced with his two beautiful wives (''vant\u0101''), said to have been abducted by the serpent [[Zahhak|A\u017ei Dah\u0101ka]] and whom the hero [[Fereydun|Thra\u0113tona]] (a [[patronymic]] from [[Avestan]] ''Thrita'') eventually wins back after confronting the monster.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1976|p=|pp=47\u201348, 52}}{{snf|Mallory|Adams|1997|page=138}}{{Sfn|West|2007|p=260}} ''Vant\u0101'', which means \"female who is desired\", has been compared with [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Indo-Iranian]] ''*dhainu'' (\"one who lactates, gives milk\"), a frequent word for \"cow\" also used to designate female humans.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1976|p=53}} Although Thra\u0113tona was aided in his quest by several deities, the pre-Zoroastrian warrior-god ''*[[Verethragna|Vr\u0325traghna]]'' (\"Smasher of Resistance\") seems the most probable original helper-god, since it was the name introduced in the Armenian version of the myth as ''[[Vahagn]].''{{Sfn|Lincoln|1976|pp=50\u201351}}\n\n==== Graeco-Roman ====\nRoman writer [[Livy]] relates the murder of Remus by his brother [[Romulus|R\u014dmulus]] at the legendary [[founding of Rome]], following a disagreement about which hill to build the city on.

According to {{Harvard citation no brackets|Polom\u00e9|1986}}, \"some elements of the [Scandinavian myth of Ymir] are distinctively Indo-Europeans\", but the reconstruction of the creation myth of the first Man and his Twin proposed by {{Harvard citation no brackets|Lincoln|1975}} \"makes too unprovable assumptions to account for the fundamental changes implied by the Scandinavian version\".</ref>\n\n== Myths ==\n=== Primordial state ===\nThe basic Indo-European root for the divine creation is *''d\u02b0eh\u2081'', \"to set in place, lay down, or establish\", from which the Vedic creator god Dh\u0101tr derive.{{Sfn|West|2007|p=354}} The concept of the [[World egg|Cosmic Egg]], symbolizing the primordial state from which the universe arises, is also found in many Indo-European creation myths.{{Sfn|Leeming|2009|p=144|ps=: \"The cosmic egg found here is also found in many Indo-European mythologies.\"}} A similar depiction of the appearence of the universe before the act of creation is given in the Vedic, Germanic and, at least partly, in the Greek tradition.{{Sfn|West|2007|pp=355\u2013356}}\n\nThe ''[[Rigveda]]'' tells us that \"neither non-being was nor being was at that time; there was not the air, nor the heaven beyond it... Neither death was nor the immortal then, nor was there the mark of night and day...\" while \"...earth was not, nor heaven above, nor tree... nor mountain there was, not a single star, nor the sun shone, nor the moon gave light, nor the bright sea...\" in the ''[[Wessobrunn Prayer|Wessobrun]]'' prayer, and the author of the ''[[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1]]'' writes that \"...there was not sand nor sea nor the cool waves; earth was nowhere nor heaven above; [[Ginnungagap|Ginnunga Gap]] there was, but grass nowhere...\"{{Sfn|Polom\u00e9|1986|p=473}}{{Sfn|West|2007|pp=355\u2013356}}\n\nAlthough the idea of a created world is untypical of early Greek thinking, similar descriptions have been highlighted in [[Aristophanes]]'s [[The Birds (play)|''The Birds'']]: \"...there was [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chasm]] and Night and dark [[Erebus|Erebos]] at first, and broad [[Tartarus]], but earth nor air nor heaven there was...\" The analogy between the Greek ''\u03a7\u1f01\u03bf\u03c2'' (\"Chaos, [[Rift|Chasm]]\") and the Norse ''[[Ginnungagap]]'' (\"Gaping abyss\") has also been noted by scholars.{{Sfn|West|2007|p=356}} The importance of ''heat'' in Germanic creation myths has also been compared with similar Indian beliefs emphasized in the Vedic hymn on \"cosmic heat\".{{Sfn|Polom\u00e9|1986|p=474}}\n\n=== Cosmic sacrifice ===\nThe first [[Human|man]] Manu and his [[giant]] twin Yemo are crossing the [[cosmos]], accompanied by the primordial cow. To create the world, Manu [[Fratricide|sacrifices his brother]] and, with the help of heavenly deities (the [[Dyeus|Sky-Father]], the [[Perkwunos|Storm-God]] and the [[Divine twins|Divine Twins]]),{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=134\u2013135}}{{Sfn|West|2007|p=357}} forges both the natural elements and [[Human|human beings]] from his twin's remains.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1975|p=139}}{{Sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|p=435\u2013436}}\n\nManu thus becomes the first priest after initiating sacrifice as the primordial condition for the world order. His deceased brother Yemo turns into the first king as social classes emerge from his anatomy (priesthood from his head, the warrior class from his breast and arms, and the commoners from his sexual organs and legs).{{Sfn|Lincoln|1975|p=139}} \n\nAlthough the European and Indo-Iranian versions differ on this matter, the primeval cow was most likely sacrificed in the original myth, giving birth to the other animals and vegetables.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1975|p=144}} Yemo may have become the King of the [[Otherworld]], the realm of the dead, as the first mortal to die in the primordial sacrifice, a role suggested by  the [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] and, to a lesser extent, in the Germanic, Greek and Celtic traditions.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1991|p=41}}{{Sfn|Jackson|2002|p=81}}{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=439}}\n\n=== First Warrior ===\nTo the third man Trito, the celestial gods offer cattle as a divine gift, which is stolen by a three-headed [[Proto-Indo-European mythology#Dragon or Serpent|serpent]] named *''{{PIE|Ng\u02b7hi}}'' (\"serpent\"; and the Indo-European root for [[Affirmation and negation|negation]]).{{Sfn|Lincoln|1976|p=51}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=134\u2013135}}\n\nTrito first suffers at his hands, but fortified by an intoxicating drink and aided by a helper-god (the [[Perkwunos|Storm-God]] or ''*H\u2090ner'', \"Man\"),{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=134\u2013135}}{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|p=437}} together they go to a cave or a mountain, and the hero finally manages to overcome the monster. Trito then gives the recovered cattle back to a priest for it to be properly sacrificed.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1976|p=58}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=134\u2013135}}{{snf|Mallory|Adams|1997|p=138}} He is now the first warrior, maintaining through his heroic deeds the cycle of mutual giving between gods and mortals.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1976|p=63\u201364}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=134\u2013135}}\n\n== Interpretations ==\n\n=== Three Functions ===\nAccording to Lincoln, Manu and Yemo seem to be the protagonists of \"a myth of the sovereign function, establishing the model for later priests and kings\", while the legend of Trito should be seen as \"a myth of the warrior function, establishing the model for all later men of arms\".{{Sfn|Lincoln|1976|p=63\u201364}} He has thus interpreted the narrative as an expression of the priests's and kings's attempt to justify their role as indispensable for the preservation of the cosmos, and therefore as essential for the organization of society.{{Sfn|Arvidsson|2006|p=302}} The motif indeed recalls the [[Georges Dum\u00e9zil|Dum\u00e9zilian]] [[Trifunctional hypothesis|tripartition]] of the cosmos between the priest (in both his magical and legal aspects), the warrior (the Third Man), and the herder (the cow).{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=134\u2013135}}\n\n=== Primeval hermaphrodite ===\nSome scholars have proposed that the primeval being Yemo was depicted as a two-folded [[hermaphrodite]] rather than a twin brother of Manu, both forming indeed a pair of complementary beings entwined together.{{Sfn|West|2007|p=358}}{{Sfn|Dandekar|1979|p=}} The Germanic names ''[[Ymir]]'' and ''Tuisto'' were understood as ''twin'', ''bisexual'' or ''hermaphrodite'', and some myths give a sister to the Vedic Yama, also called Yam\u012b (\"Twin\").{{Sfn|Puhvel|1987|p=63}}{{Sfn|Mallory|Adams|1997|p=129}}{{Sfn|West|2007|pp=356\u2013357}} The primordial being may therefore have self-sacrificed,{{Sfn|Dandekar|1979|p=}} or have been divided in two, a male half and a female half, embodying a prototypal separation of the sexes that continued the primordial union of the Sky Father ([[Dyeus|Dy\u0113us]]) with the Mother Earth ([[Dh\u00e9\u01f5h\u014dm]]).{{Sfn|West|2007|p=358}}\n\n=== Cattle-raiding myth ===\nThe story of Trito served as a model for later [[cattle raiding]] epic myths and most likely as a moral justification for the practice of raiding among Indo-European peoples. In their legends, Trito is portrayed as only taking back what rightfully belongs to his people, those who sacrifice properly to the gods.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1976|p=63\u201364}}{{snf|Mallory|Adams|1997|page=138}} Although cattle raiding is a common theme found in every societies keeping cattle, it was particularly popular among Indo-European peoples, as attested by the legends of [[Indra]] and the [[Panis]], [[Beowulf]] and [[Grendel]], the quest of Queen [[Medb]] for the Bull, or [[Odysseus]] hunting down the cattle of [[Helios]].{{Sfn|Lincoln|1976|p=44}}\n\nThe myth has been variously interpreted as a cosmic conflict between a heavenly hero and an earthly serpent; as a depiction of the male fellowships' struggle to protect society against external evil; or as an Indo-European victory over non-Indo-European people, the monster symbolizing the aboriginal thief or usurper.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1976|pp=58, 62}}{{snf|Mallory|Adams|1997|page=138}}{{Sfn|Arvidsson|2006|p=302}} The Vedic serpent [[Vishvarupa|Vi\u015bvar\u016bpa]] is indeed described as a *''d\u0101sa'', an aboriginal inhabitant who is inimical to the Indo-European invaders; the Iranian serpent [[Zahhak|A\u017ei Dah\u0101ka]] carries in his name the pejorative suffix ''-ka''; and the Latin inimical giant [[Cacus|C\u0101cus]] is depicted as a non-Indo-European aborigine (''incola''), hostile to Romans and Greeks alike.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1976|pp=52, 57}} According to [[Martin Litchfield West|Martin L. West]], the Proto-Indo-European name ''*Trito'' (\"Third\") may have been a \"poetic or hieratic code-name, fully comprehensible only with specialized knowledge\".{{Sfn|West|2007|p=260}}\n\n== Evidence ==\n\n=== Linguistic ===\n\n==== Manu and Yemo ====\n[[Cognate]]s deriving from the Proto-Indo-European First Priest ''*Manu'' (\"[[Human|Man]]\", \"ancestor of mankind\") include the Indic [[Manu (Hinduism)|M\u00e1nu]], legendary first man in [[Hinduism]], and Man\u0101v\u012b, his sacrificed wife;

They are both known as preparers of the Indo-Iranian sacred beverage ''*[[Soma (drink)|sauma]]''[[Soma (drink)|,]] which the hero ''*Trita Atpya'' probably drank to obtain god-like powers.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1976|p=|pp=47\u201348}} The Greek story of [[Heracles|Herakles]] recovering the stolen cattle from the thee-headed monster [[Geryon]] is probably related, and a Germanic reflex may be found in the depiction of a three-head man fighting three serpents while holding a goat.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1976|p=58}}{{snf|Mallory|Adams|1997|page=138}}\n\n==== Indian ====\n[[Manu (Hinduism)|M\u00e1nu]] (\"Man, human\") appears in the ''[[Rigveda]]'' as the first sacrificer and the founder of religious law, the [[Manusmriti|Law of M\u00e1nu]].{{Sfn|Lincoln|1975|p=134}}{{Sfn|Fortson|2004|p=27}} He is the brother (or half-brother) of [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]] (\"Twin\"), both appearing as the sons of [[Surya|Vivasvat]]. The association of M\u00e1nu with the ritual of sacrifice is so strong that those who do not sacrifice are named ''amanu\u1e63\u0101\u1e25'', which means \"not belonging to M\u00e1nu\", \"unlike M\u00e1nu\", or \"inhuman\".{{Sfn|Lincoln|1975|pp=134\u2013135}} The Song of [[Purusha|Puru\u1e63a]] (another word meaning \"man\") tells how the body parts of the sacrificed primeval man led to the creation of the [[cosmos]] (the heaven from his head, the air from his navel, the earth from his legs) and the Hindu [[Caste system in India|castes]] (the upper parts becoming the upper castes and the lower parts the commoners).{{Sfn|Puhvel|1987|p=286}}{{Sfn|Fortson|2004|p=27}}{{Sfn|West|2007|p=357}} In the later ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana|\u015aatapatha Br\u0101hmana]]'', both a primordial bull and M\u00e1nu's wife Man\u0101v\u012b are sacrificed by the demi-gods [[Asura]]s. According to Lincoln, this could represent an independent variant of the original myth, with the figure of Yama laying behind that of Man\u0101v\u012b.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1975|pp=133\u2013134}}\n\nInvoked in funeral hymns of the ''[[Rigveda]]'', [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]] is depicted as the first man to die, the one who established the path towards death after he freely chose his own departure from life.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1991|p=|pp=32\u201333}} Although his realm was originally associated with feasting, beauty and happiness, Yama was gradually portrayed as a horrific being and the ruler of the [[Otherworld]] in the epic and [[Puranas|puranic]] traditions.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1991|p=|pp=32\u201333}} Some scholars have equated this abandonment (or transcendence) of his own body by Yama with the sacrifice of [[Purusha|Puru\u1e63a]].{{Sfn|Lincoln|1975|p=133}}{{Sfn|Puhvel|1987|p=286}} In a motif shared with the Iranian tradition, touched in the ''Rigveda'' and told in later traditions, Yama and his twin sister Yam\u012b are presented as the children of the sun-god Vivasvat. Discussing the [[Incest taboo|advisability]] of the primordial incest in a primordial context, Yam\u012b insists to have a [[sexual intercourse]] with her brother Yama, who rejects it, thus forgoing his role as the creator of mankind.{{Sfn|Puhvel|1987|p=63}}\n\nIn the Vedic tradition, [[Trita|Trita \u0100ptya]] and [[Indra]] maintain a relationship of mutual assistance, Trita giving [[Soma (drink)|soma]] to the god so that he can, in return, provide help to the hero in his fight against the monster [[Vishvarupa|Vi\u015bvar\u016bpa]].{{Sfn|Lincoln|1976|p=50}}{{snf|Mallory|Adams|1997|page=138}} Trita confronts the three-headed dragon (''\u00e1hi-''), and kills him to let the cows go out. Finally, Indra cuts off three heads of Vi\u015bvar\u016bpa and drives the cows home for Trita.{{Sfn|West|2007|p=260}}\n\n==== Iranian ====\nAfter a religious transformation led by [[Zoroaster|Zarathustra]] that degraded the status of prior myths and deities (c. 1500\u20131000 BC), ''*Manu\u0161'' was replaced in the Iranian tradition by three different figures: [[Ahriman]], who took his role as first sacrificer; Man\u016b\u0161\u010dihr (\"son\" or \"seed of Manu\u0161\"), who replaced him as ancestor of the priestly line; and Zarathustra himself, who took his role as priest ''par excellence''. Man\u016b\u0161\u010dihr is described in the ''[[Bundahishn|Greater Bun-dahi\u0161n\u012bh]]'' as the ancestor of all ''M\u014dpats'' (\"High Priests\") of [[Parsis|Pars]], and it has been proposed that ''*Manu\u0161'' was originally regarded as the First Priest among pre-[[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] tribes.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1975|p=136}}[[File:Jamshid_(The_Shahnama_of_Shah_Tahmasp).png|alt=|thumb|218x218px|The Iranian mythical king [[Jamshid|Yima]]. c. 1522.]]In pre-Zoroastrian Iran, [[Jamshid|Yima]] was seen as the first king and first mortal. The original myth of creation was indeed condemned by [[Zoroaster|Zarathustra]], who makes mention of it in the ''[[Avesta]]'' as the two spirits that \"appeared in the beginning as two twins in a dream ... (and) who first met and instituted life and non-life\".{{Sfn|Lincoln|1975|pp=129\u2013130}} Yima in particular is depicted as the first to distribute portions of the cow for consumption,{{Sfn|West|2007|pp=357\u2013358}} and therefore explicitly condemned for having introduced the eating of meat.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1991|p=38}} After a brief reign on earth, the king Yima was said in a later tradition to be deprived of his triple royal nimbus, which embodied the three social classes in Iranian myths. [[Mithra]] receives the part of the Priest, [[Fereydun|Thra\u0113tona]] that of the Warrior, and [[Gershasp (gladiator)|K\u0259r\u0259s\u0101spa]] that of the Commoner.

The story, giving a central position to the new religious leader, is once again probably the result of a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] reformation, and Yima may have been the original ruler of the realm of the dead.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1991|p=38}} \n\nIn the ''Younger Avestan'', the stolen cattle of ''*Trito'' was replaced with his two beautiful wives (''vant\u0101''), said to have been abducted by the serpent [[Zahhak|A\u017ei Dah\u0101ka]] and whom the hero [[Fereydun|Thra\u0113tona]] (a [[patronymic]] from [[Avestan]] ''Thrita'') eventually wins back after confronting the monster.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1976|p=|pp=47\u201348, 52}}{{snf|Mallory|Adams|1997|page=138}}{{Sfn|West|2007|p=260}} ''Vant\u0101'', which means \"female who is desired\", has been compared with [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Indo-Iranian]] ''*dhainu'' (\"one who lactates, gives milk\"), a frequent word for \"cow\" also used to designate female humans.{{Sfn|Lincoln|1976|p=53}} Although Thra\u0113tona was aided in his quest by several deities, the pre-Zoroastrian warrior-god ''*[[Verethragna|Vr\u0325traghna]]'' (\"Smasher of Resistance\") seems the most probable original helper-god, since it was the name introduced in the Armenian version of the myth as ''[[Vahagn]].''{{Sfn|Lincoln|1976|pp=50\u201351}}\n\n==== Graeco-Roman ====\nRoman writer [[Livy]] relates the murder of Remus by his brother [[Romulus|R\u014dmulus]] at the legendary [[founding of Rome]], following a disagreement about which hill to build the city on.

{"title_page": "Triangulated category", "text_new": "In [[mathematics]], a '''triangulated category''' is a [[category (mathematics)|category]] with the additional structure of a \"translation functor\" and a class of \"exact triangles\". Prominent examples are the [[derived category]] of an [[abelian category]], as well as the [[stable homotopy category]]. The exact triangles generalize the [[short exact sequence]]s in an abelian category, as well as [[fibration sequence|fiber sequences]] and [[cofiber|cofiber sequences]] in topology. \n\nMuch of [[homological algebra]] is clarified and extended by the language of triangulated categories, an important example being the theory of [[sheaf cohomology]]. In the 1960s, a typical use of triangulated categories was to extend properties of sheaves on a space ''X'' to complexes of sheaves, viewed as objects of the derived category of sheaves on ''X''. More recently, triangulated categories have become objects of interest in their own right. Many equivalences between triangulated categories of different origins have been proved or conjectured. For example, the [[homological mirror symmetry]] conjecture predicts that the derived category of a [[Calabi\u2013Yau manifold]] is equivalent to the [[Fukaya category]] of its \"mirror\" [[symplectic manifold]].\n\n==History==\nTriangulated categories were introduced independently by Dieter Puppe (1962) and [[Jean-Louis Verdier]] (1963), although Puppe's axioms were less complete (lacking the octahedral axiom (TR 4)).<ref>Puppe (1962, 1967); Verdier (1963, 1967).</ref> Puppe was motivated by the stable homotopy category. Verdier's key example was the derived category of an abelian category, which he also defined, developing ideas of [[Alexander Grothendieck]]. The early applications of derived categories included [[coherent duality]] and [[Verdier duality]], which extends [[Poincar\u00e9 duality]] to singular spaces.\n\n==Definition==\nA '''shift''' or '''translation functor''' on a category ''D'' is an automorphism  (or for some authors, an auto-[[equivalence of categories|equivalence]]) <math>\\Sigma</math> from ''D'' to ''D''. It is common to write <math>X[n] =\\Sigma^n X</math> for integers ''n''.\n\nA '''triangle''' (''X'', ''Y'', ''Z'', ''u'', ''v'', ''w'') consists of three objects ''X'', ''Y'', and ''Z'', together with morphisms <math>u\\colon X\\to Y</math>, <math>v\\colon Y \\to Z</math> and <math>w\\colon Z\\to X[1]</math>. Triangles are generally written in the unravelled form:\n:<math>X \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop u} Y \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop v} Z \\xrightarrow {{} \\atop w} X[1],</math>\nor \n:<math>X \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop u} Y \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop v} Z \\xrightarrow {{} \\atop w} </math>\nfor short.\n\nA '''triangulated category''' is an [[additive category]] ''D'' with a translation functor and a class of triangles, called '''exact triangles'''<ref>Weibel (1994), Definition 10.2.1.</ref> (or '''distinguished triangles'''), satisfying the following properties (TR 1), (TR 2), (TR 3) and (TR 4). (These axioms are not entirely independent, since (TR 3) can be derived from the others.<ref>J. Peter May, [http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/MISC/Triangulate.pdf ''The axioms for triangulated categories''].</ref>)\n\n===TR 1===\n*For every object ''X'', the following triangle is exact:\n::<math>X \\overset{\\text{id}}{\\to} X \\to 0 \\to X[1]</math>\n*For every morphism <math>u\\colon X\\to Y</math>, there is an object ''Z'' (called a '''cone''' or '''cofiber''' of the morphism ''u'') fitting into an exact triangle\n::<math>X \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop u} Y \\to Z \\to X[1]</math>\n:The name \"cone\" comes from the [[mapping cone (homological algebra)|cone]] of a map of [[chain complex]]es, which in turn was inspired by the [[mapping cone (topology)|mapping cone]] in topology. It follows from the other axioms that an exact triangle (and in particular the object ''Z'') is determined up to isomorphism by the morphism <math>X\\to Y</math>, although not always up to a unique isomorphism.<ref name=\"cone\">Weibel (1994), Remark 10.2.2.</ref>\n* Every triangle isomorphic to an exact triangle is exact. This means that if\n::<math>X \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop u} Y \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop v} Z \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop w} X[1]</math>\n:is an exact triangle, and <math>f\\colon X\\to X'</math>, <math>g\\colon Y\\to Y'</math>, and <math>h\\colon Z\\to Z'</math> are isomorphisms, then\n::<math>X' \\xrightarrow{guf^{-1}} Y'\\xrightarrow{hvg^{-1}} Z' \\xrightarrow {f[1]wh^{-1}} X'[1]</math>\n:is also an exact triangle.\n\n===TR 2===\nIf \n:<math>X \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop u} Y \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop v} Z \\xrightarrow {{} \\atop w} X[1]</math>\nis an exact triangle, then so are the two rotated triangles \n:<math>Y \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop v} Z \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop w} X[1] \\xrightarrow{-u[1]} Y[1]</math>\nand\n:<math>Z[-1] \\xrightarrow{-w[-1]} X \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop u} Y \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop v} Z.\\ </math>\nIn view of the last triangle, the object ''Z''[\u22121] is called a '''fiber''' of the morphism <math>X\\to Y</math>.\n\nThe second rotated triangle has a more complex form when <math>[1]</math> and <math>[-1]</math> are not isomorphisms but only mutually inverse equivalences of categories, since <math>-w[-1]</math> is a morphism from <math>Z[-1]</math> to <math>(X[1])[-1]</math>, and to obtain a morphism to <math>[X]</math> one must compose with the natural transformation <math>(X[1])[-1] \\xrightarrow{} X</math>. This leads to complex questions about possible axioms one has to impose on the natural transformations making <math>[1]</math> and <math>[-1]</math> into a pair of inverse equivalences. Due to this issue, the assumption that <math>[1]</math> and <math>[-1]</math> are mutually inverse isomorphisms is the usual choice in the definition of a triangulated category.\n\n===TR 3===\nGiven two exact triangles and a map between the first morphisms in each triangle, there exists a morphism between the third objects in each of the two triangles that makes [[commutative diagram|everything commute]]. That is, in the following diagram (where the two rows are exact triangles and ''f'' and ''g'' are morphisms such that ''gu'' = ''u\u2032f''), there exists a map ''h'' (not necessarily unique) making all the squares commute:\n:[[Image:Axiom TR3.svg|300px]]\n\n===TR 4: The octahedral axiom===\nLet <math>u\\colon X\\to Y</math> and <math>v\\colon Y\\to Z</math> be morphisms, and consider the composed morphism <math>vu\\colon X\\to Z</math>. Form exact triangles for each of these three morphisms according to TR 1. The octahedral axiom states (roughly) that the three mapping cones can be made into the vertices of an exact triangle so that \"everything commutes\".\n\nMore formally, given exact triangles\n:<math>X \\xrightarrow{u\\,} Y \\xrightarrow{j} Z' \\xrightarrow {k} X[1]</math>\n:<math>Y \\xrightarrow{v\\,} Z \\xrightarrow{l} X' \\xrightarrow {i} Y[1]</math>\n:<math>X \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop vu} Z \\xrightarrow{m} Y' \\xrightarrow {n} X[1]</math>,\nthere exists an exact triangle\n:<math>Z' \\xrightarrow{f} Y' \\xrightarrow{g} X' \\xrightarrow {h} Z'[1]</math>\nsuch that\n:<math>l=gm,\\quad k=nf,\\quad h=j[1]i,\\quad ig=u[1]n,\\quad fj=mv.</math>\n\nThis axiom is called the \"octahedral axiom\" because drawing all the objects and morphisms gives the skeleton of an [[octahedron]], four of whose faces are exact triangles. The presentation here is Verdier's own, and appears, complete with octahedral diagram, in {{Harvard citations|last = Hartshorne|year = 1966}}.  In the following diagram, ''u'' and ''v'' are the given morphisms, and the primed letters are the cones of various maps (chosen so that every exact triangle has an ''X'', a ''Y'', and a ''Z'' letter).  Various arrows have been marked with [1] to indicate that they are of \"degree 1\"; e.g. the map from ''Z''\u2032 to ''X'' is in fact from ''Z''\u2032 to ''X''[1].  The octahedral axiom then asserts the existence of maps ''f'' and ''g'' forming an exact triangle, and so that ''f'' and ''g'' form commutative triangles in the other faces that contain them:\n:[[Image:Axiom TR4 (polyhedron).svg|250px]]\n\nTwo different pictures appear in {{Harvard citations|last1 = Beilinson|last2 = Bernstein|last3 = Deligne|year = 1982}} ({{Harvard citations|last1 = Gelfand|last2 = Manin|year = 2006|txt = yes}} also present the first one).  The first presents the upper and lower pyramids of the above octahedron and asserts that given a lower pyramid, one can fill in an upper pyramid so that the two paths from ''Y'' to ''Y''\u2032, and from ''Y''\u2032 to ''Y'', are equal (this condition is omitted, perhaps erroneously, from Hartshorne's presentation). The triangles marked + are commutative and those marked \"d\" are exact:\n:[[Image:Axiom TR4 (caps).svg|550px]]\nThe second diagram is a more innovative presentation. Exact triangles are presented linearly, and the diagram emphasizes the fact that the four triangles in the \"octahedron\" are connected by a series of maps of triangles, where three triangles (namely, those completing the morphisms from ''X'' to ''Y'', from ''Y'' to ''Z'', and from ''X'' to ''Z'') are given and the existence of the fourth is claimed. One passes between the first two by \"pivoting\" about ''X'', to the third by pivoting about ''Z'', and to the fourth by pivoting about ''X''\u2032. All enclosures in this diagram are commutative (both trigons and the square) but the other commutative square, expressing the equality of the two paths from ''Y''\u2032 to ''Y'', is not evident.  All the arrows pointing \"off the edge\" are degree 1:\n:[[Image:Axiom TR4 (BBD).svg|300px]]\nThis last diagram also illustrates a useful intuitive interpretation of the octahedral axiom.  In triangulated categories, triangles play the role of exact sequences, and so it is suggestive to think of these objects as \"quotients\", <math>Z' = Y/X</math> and <math>Y' = Z/X</math>. In those terms, the existence of the last triangle expresses on the one hand\n:<math>X' = Z/Y\\ </math> (looking at the triangle <math>Y \\to Z \\to X' \\to</math>&nbsp;), and\n:<math>X' = Y'/Z'</math> (looking at the triangle <math>Z' \\to Y' \\to X' \\to</math>&nbsp;).\nPutting these together, the octahedral axiom asserts the \"third isomorphism theorem\":\n:<math>(Z/X)/(Y/X)\\cong Z/Y.</math>\nIf the triangulated category is the derived category ''D''(''A'') of an abelian category ''A'', and ''X'', ''Y'', ''Z'' are objects of ''A'' viewed as complexes concentrated in degree 0, and the maps <math>X\\to Y</math> and <math>Y\\to Z</math> are monomorphisms in ''A'', then the cones of these morphisms in ''D''(''A'') are actually isomorphic to the quotients above in ''A''.\n\nFinally, {{Harvard citations|last = Neeman|year = 2001|txt = yes}} formulates the octahedral axiom using a two-dimensional commutative diagram with 4 rows and 4 columns. {{Harvard citations|last1 = Beilinson|last2 = Bernstein|last3 = Deligne|year = 1982|txt = yes}} also give generalizations of the octahedral axiom.\n\n==Properties==\nHere are some simple consequences of the axioms for a triangulated category ''D''.\n\n*Given an exact triangle\n::<math>X \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop u} Y \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop v} Z \\xrightarrow {{} \\atop w} X[1]</math>\n:in ''D'', the composition of any two successive morphisms is zero. That is, ''vu'' = 0, ''wv'' = 0, ''u''[1]''w'' = 0, and so on.<ref>Weibel (1994), Exercise 10.2.1.</ref>\n\n*Given a morphism <math>u\\colon X\\to Y</math>, TR 1 guarantees the existence of a cone ''Z'' completing an exact triangle. Any two cones of ''u'' are isomorphic, but the isomorphism is not always uniquely determined.<ref name=\"cone\" />\n\n*Every [[monomorphism]] in ''D'' is the inclusion of a direct summand, <math>X\\to X\\oplus Y</math>, and every [[epimorphism]] is a projection <math>X\\oplus Y\\to X</math>.<ref>Gelfand & Manin (2006), Exercise IV.1.1.</ref> A related point is that one should not talk about \"injectivity\" or \"surjectivity\" for  morphisms in a triangulated category. Every  morphism <math>X\\to Y</math> that is not an isomorphism has a nonzero \"cokernel\" ''Z'' (meaning that there is an exact triangle <math>X\\to Y\\to Z\\to X[1]</math>) and also a nonzero \"kernel\", namely ''Z''[\u22121].\n\n==Examples==\n{{Ordered list\n| [[Vector space]]s over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''k'' form an elementary triangulated category in which ''X''[1] {{=}} ''X'' for all ''X''. An exact triangle is a sequence <math>X \\to Y \\to Z \\to X \\to Y</math> of ''k''-linear maps (writing the same map <math>X\\to Y</math> twice) which is [[exact sequence|exact]] at ''X'', ''Y'' and ''Z''.\n\n| If ''A'' is an additive category (for example, an abelian category), define the [[homotopy category of chain complexes|homotopy category]] {{tmath|K(A)}} to have objects the [[chain complex|complexes]] in ''A'', and as morphisms the [[chain homotopy|homotopy classes]] of morphisms of complexes. Then {{tmath|K(A)}} is a triangulated category.<ref>Kashiwara & Schapira (2006), Theorem 11.2.6.</ref> The shift ''X''[1] is the complex ''X'' moved one step to the left (and with differentials multiplied by \u22121). An exact triangle in {{tmath|K(A)}} is a triangle which is isomorphic in {{tmath|K(A)}} to the triangle <math>X\\to Y\\to\\text{cone}(f)\\to X[1]</math> associated to some map <math>f\\colon X\\to Y</math> of chain complexes. (Here <math>\\text{cone}(f)</math> denotes the [[mapping cone (homological algebra)|mapping cone]] of a chain map.) \n\n| The [[derived category]] ''D''(''A'') of an abelian category ''A'' is a triangulated category.<ref>Weibel (1994), Corollary 10.4.3.</ref> It is constructed from the category of complexes ''C''(''A'') by [[localization of a category|localizing]] with respect to all [[quasi-isomorphism]]s. That is, formally adjoin an inverse morphism for every quasi-isomorphism. The objects of ''D''(''A'') are unchanged; that is, they are chain complexes. An exact triangle in ''D''(''A'') is a triangle which is isomorphic in ''D''(''A'') to the triangle <math>X\\to Y\\to\\text{cone}(f)\\to X[1]</math> associated to some map <math>f\\colon X\\to Y</math> of chain complexes.\n\n<br />A key motivation for the derived category is that [[derived functor]]s on ''A'' can be viewed as functors on the derived category.<ref>Weibel (1994), section 10.5.</ref> Some natural subcategories of ''D''(''A'') are also triangulated categories, for example the subcategory of complexes ''X'' whose cohomology objects <math>H^i(X)</math> in ''A'' vanish for ''i'' sufficiently negative, sufficiently positive, or both, called <math>D^+(A),D^-(A),D^{\\text{b}}(A)</math>, respectively.\n\n| In topology, the [[stable homotopy category]] <math>h\\cal{S}</math> is a triangulated category.<ref>Weibel (1994), Theorem 10.9.18.</ref> The objects are [[Spectrum (homotopy theory)|spectra]], the shift ''X''[1] is the [[suspension (topology)|suspension]] <math>\\Sigma X</math> (or equivalently the delooping <math>\\Omega^{-1}X</math>), and the exact triangles are the cofiber sequences. A distinctive feature of the stable homotopy category (compared to the [[homotopy category|unstable homotopy category]]) is that fiber sequences are the same as cofiber sequences. In fact, in any triangulated category, exact triangles can be viewed as fiber sequences and also as cofiber sequences.\n\n| In [[modular representation theory]] of a finite group ''G'', the [[stable module category]] StMod(''kG'') is a triangulated category. Its objects are the representations of ''G'' over a field ''k'', and the morphisms are the usual ones modulo those that factor via [[projective module|projective]] (or equivalently [[injective module|injective]]) ''kG''-modules. More generally, the stable module category is defined for any [[Frobenius algebra]] in place of ''kG''.\n}}\n\n==Are there better axioms?==\nSome experts suspect (see, for example, {{Harvard citations|last1 = Gelfand|last2 = Manin|year = 2006|loc1 = Introduction|loc2 = Chapter IV}}) that triangulated categories are not really the \"correct\" concept. The essential reason is that the cone of a morphism is unique only up to a ''non-unique'' isomorphism. In particular, the cone of a morphism does not in general depend [[functor]]ially on the morphism (note the non-uniqueness in axiom (TR 3), for example). This non-uniqueness is a potential source of errors. The axioms work adequately in practice, however, and there is a great deal of literature devoted to their study.\n\nOne alternative proposal is the theory of [[derivator]]s initiated by Grothendieck in 1991. Another is that of [[stable \u221e-category|stable \u221e-categories]]. The homotopy category of a stable \u221e-category is canonically triangulated, and moreover mapping cones become essentially unique (in a precise homotopical sense).  Moreover, a stable \u221e-category naturally encodes a whole hierarchy of compatibilities for its homotopy category, at the bottom of which sits the octahedral axiom. Thus, it is strictly stronger to give the data of a stable \u221e-category than to give the data of a triangulation of its homotopy category. Nearly all triangulated categories that arise in practice come from stable \u221e-categories. A similar (but more special) enrichment of triangulated categories is the notion of a [[dg-category]].\n\nIn some ways, stable \u221e-categories or dg-categories work better than triangulated categories. One example is the notion of an exact functor between triangulated categories, discussed below. For a [[smooth scheme|smooth]] [[projective variety]] ''X'' over a field ''k'', the bounded derived category of [[coherent sheaves]] <math>\\text{D}^{\\text{b}}(X)</math> comes from a dg-category in a natural way. For varieties ''X'' and ''Y'', every functor from the dg-category of ''X'' to that of ''Y'' comes from a complex of sheaves on <math>X\\times Y</math> by the [[Fourier\u2013Mukai transform]].<ref>To\u00ebn (2007), Theorem 8.15.</ref> By contrast, there is an example of an exact functor from <math>\\text{D}^{\\text{b}}(X)</math> to <math>\\text{D}^{\\text{b}}(Y)</math> that does not come from a complex of sheaves on <math>X\\times Y</math>.<ref>Rizzardo et al. (2019), Theorem 1.4.</ref> In view of this example, the \"right\" notion of a morphism between triangulated categories seems to be one that comes from a morphism of underlying dg-categories (or stable \u221e-categories).\n\nAnother advantage of stable \u221e-categories or dg-categories over triangulated categories appears in [[algebraic K-theory]]. One can define the algebraic K-theory of a stable \u221e-category or dg-category ''C'', giving a sequence of abelian groups <math>K_i(C)</math> for integers ''i''. The group <math>K_0(C)</math> has a simple description in terms of the triangulated category associated to ''C''. But an example shows that the higher K-groups of a dg-category are not always determined by the associated triangulated category.<ref>Dugger & Shipley (2009), Remark 4.9.</ref> Thus a triangulated category has a well-defined <math>K_0</math> group, but in general not higher K-groups.\n \nOn the other hand, the theory of triangulated categories is simpler than the theory of stable \u221e-categories or dg-categories, and in many applications the triangulated structure is sufficient. An example is the proof of the [[Bloch\u2013Kato conjecture]], where many computations were done at the level of triangulated categories, and the additional structure of \u221e-categories or dg-categories was not required.\n\n==Cohomology in triangulated categories==\nTriangulated categories admit a notion of cohomology, and every triangulated category has a large supply of cohomological functors. A '''cohomological functor''' ''F'' from a triangulated category ''D'' to an abelian category ''A'' is a functor such that for every exact triangle\n:<math>X \\to Y \\to Z \\to X[1],\\ </math>\nthe sequence <math>F(X)\\to F(Y)\\to F(Z)</math> in ''A'' is exact. Since an exact triangle determines an infinite sequence of exact triangles in both directions,\n:<math>\\cdots\\to Z[-1]\\to X\\to Y \\to Z \\to X[1] \\to\\cdots,\\ </math>\na cohomological functor ''F'' actually gives a [[long exact sequence]] in the abelian category ''A'':\n:<math>\\cdots\\to F(Z[-1])\\to F(X)\\to F(Y)\\to F(Z)\\to F(X[1])\\to\\cdots.\\ </math>\n\nA key example is: for each object ''B'' in a triangulated category ''D'', the functors <math>\\operatorname{Hom}(B, \\text{-})</math> and <math>\\operatorname{Hom}(\\text{-}, B)</math> are cohomological, with values in the category of [[abelian group]]s.<ref>Weibel (1994), Example 10.2.8.</ref> (To be precise, the latter is a [[contravariant functor]], which can be considered as a functor on the [[opposite category]] of ''D''.) That is, an exact triangle <math>X\\to Y\\to Z\\to X[1]</math> determines two long exact sequences of abelian groups:\n:<math>\\cdots \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(B,X[i])\\to \\operatorname{Hom}(B,Y[i])\\to \\operatorname{Hom}(B,Z[i])\\to \\operatorname{Hom}(B,X[i+1])\\to\\cdots</math>\nand\n:<math>\\cdots\\to\\operatorname{Hom}(Z,B[i])\\to\\operatorname{Hom}(Y,B[i])\\to\\operatorname{Hom}(X,B[i])\\to\\operatorname{Hom}(Z,B[i+1])\\to\\cdots.</math>\nFor particular triangulated categories, these exact sequences yield many of the important exact sequences in sheaf cohomology, [[group cohomology]], and other areas of mathematics.\n\nOne may also use the notation\n:<math>\\operatorname{Ext}^i(B,X)=\\operatorname{Hom}(B,X[i])</math>\nfor integers ''i'', generalizing the [[Ext functor]] in an abelian category. In this notation, the first exact sequence above would be written:\n:<math>\\cdots \\to \\operatorname{Ext}^i(B,X) \\to \\operatorname{Ext}^i(B,Y) \\to \\operatorname{Ext}^i(B,Z) \\to \\operatorname{Ext}^{i+1}(B,X)\\to\\cdots.\\ </math>\n\nFor an abelian category ''A'', another basic example of a cohomological functor on the derived category ''D''(''A'') sends a complex ''X'' to the object <math>H^0(X)</math> in ''A''. That is, an exact triangle <math>X\\to Y\\to Z\\to X[1]</math> in ''D''(''A'') determines a long exact sequence in ''A'':\n:<math>\\cdots\\to H^i(X)\\to H^i(Y)\\to H^i(Z)\\to H^{i+1}(X)\\to\\cdots,</math>\nusing that <math>H^0(X[i])\\cong H^i(X)</math>.\n\n==Exact functors and equivalences==\nAn '''exact functor''' (also called '''triangulated functor''') from a triangulated category ''D'' to a triangulated category ''E'' is an additive functor <math>F\\colon D\\to E</math> which, loosely speaking, commutes with translation and sends exact triangles to exact triangles.<ref>Weibel (1994), Definition 10.2.6.</ref>\n\nIn more detail, an exact functor comes with a [[natural transformation|natural isomorphism]] <math>\\eta\\colon F\\Sigma\\to \\Sigma F</math> (where the first <math>\\Sigma</math> denotes the translation functor of ''D'' and the second <math>\\Sigma</math> denotes the translation functor of ''E''), such that whenever\n:<math>X \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop u} Y \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop v} Z \\xrightarrow {{} \\atop w} X[1]</math> \nis an exact triangle in ''D'',\n:<math>F(X) \\xrightarrow{F(u)} F(Y) \\xrightarrow{F(v)} F(Z) \\xrightarrow {\\eta_X F(w)} F(X)[1]</math> \nis an exact triangle in ''E''.\n\nAn '''equivalence''' of triangulated categories is an exact functor <math>F\\colon D\\to E</math> that is also an [[equivalence of categories]]. In this case, there is an exact functor <math>G\\colon E\\to D</math> such that ''FG'' and ''GF'' are naturally isomorphic to the respective identity functors.\n\n==Compactly generated triangulated categories==\nLet ''D'' be a triangulated category such that [[direct sum]]s indexed by an arbitrary set (not necessarily finite) exist in ''D''. An object ''X'' in ''D'' is called '''compact''' if the functor <math>\\text{Hom}_D(X,\\text{-})</math> commutes with direct sums. Explicitly, this means that for every family of objects <math>Y_i</math> in ''D'' indexed by a set ''S'', the natural homomorphism of abelian groups <math>\\oplus_{i\\in S}\\mathrm{Hom}_D(X,Y_i)\\to\\mathrm{Hom}_D(X,\\oplus_{i\\in S}Y_i)</math> is an isomorphism. This is different from the general notion of a [[compact object (category theory)|compact object]] in category theory, which involves all colimits rather than only coproducts.\n\nFor example, a compact object in the stable homotopy category <math>h\\cal{S}</math> is a finite spectrum.<ref>Neeman (2001), Remark D.1.5.</ref> A compact object in the derived category of a ring, or in the [[quasi-coherent sheaf|quasi-coherent]] derived category of a scheme, is a [[perfect complex]]. In the case of a smooth projective variety ''X'' over a field, the category Perf(''X'') of perfect complexes can also be viewed as the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves, <math>D^{\\text{b}}_{\\text{coh}}(X)</math>.\n\nA triangulated category ''D'' is '''compactly generated''' if \n* ''D'' has arbitrary (not necessarily finite) direct sums;\n* There is a set ''S'' of compact objects in ''D'' such that for every nonzero object ''X'' in ''D'', there is an object ''Y'' in ''S'' with a nonzero map <math>Y[n]\\to X</math> for some integer ''n''.\n\nMany naturally occurring \"large\" triangulated categories are compactly generated:\n* The derived category of modules over a ring ''R'' is compactly generated by one object, the ''R''-module ''R''.\n* The quasi-coherent derived category of a [[quasi-compact morphism|quasi-compact]] [[quasi-separated scheme]] is compactly generated by one object.<ref>{{Citation | title=Stacks Project, Tag 09IS | url=http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/09IS}}, {{Citation | title=Stacks Project, Tag 09M1 | url=http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/09M1}}.</ref>\n* The stable homotopy category is compactly generated by one object, the sphere spectrum <math>S^0</math>.<ref>Neeman (2001), Lemma D.1.3.</ref>\n\nAmnon Neeman generalized the [[Brown representability theorem]] to any compactly generated triangulated category, as follows.<ref name=\"grduality\">Neeman (1996), Theorems 3.1 and 4.1.</ref> Let ''D'' be a compactly generated triangulated category, <math>H\\colon D^{\\text{op}}\\to\\text{Ab}</math> a cohomological functor which takes coproducts to products. Then ''H'' is representable. (That is, there is an object ''W'' of ''D'' such that <math>H(X)\\cong\\text{Hom}(X,W)</math> for all ''X''.) For another version, let ''D'' be a compactly generated triangulated category, ''T'' any triangulated category. If an exact functor <math>F\\colon D\\to T</math> sends coproducts to coproducts, then ''F'' has a [[adjoint functors|right adjoint]].\n\nThe Brown representability theorem can be used to define various functors between triangulated categories. In particular, Neeman used it to simplify and generalize the construction of the [[exceptional inverse image functor]] <math>f^!</math> for a morphism ''f'' of [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]], the central feature of [[coherent duality]] theory.<ref>Neeman (1996), Example 4.2.</ref>\n\n==t-structures==\n{{main|t-structure}}\nFor every abelian category ''A'', the derived category ''D''(''A'') is a triangulated category, containing ''A'' as a full subcategory (the complexes concentrated in degree zero). Different abelian categories can have equivalent derived categories, so that it is not always possible to reconstruct ''A'' from ''D''(''A'') as a triangulated category.\n\n[[Alexander Beilinson]], [[Joseph Bernstein]] and [[Pierre Deligne]] described this situation by the notion of a ''t-structure'' on a triangulated category ''D''.<ref>Beilinson et al. (1982), Definition 1.3.1.</ref> A t-structure on ''D'' determines an abelian category inside ''D'', and different t-structures on ''D'' may yield different abelian categories.\n\n==Localizing and thick subcategories==\nLet ''D'' be a triangulated category with arbitrary direct sums. A '''localizing subcategory''' of ''D'' is a [[strictly full subcategory|strictly full]] triangulated subcategory that is closed under arbitrary direct sums.<ref>Neeman (2001), Introduction, after Remark 1.4.</ref> To explain the name: if a localizing subcategory ''S'' of a compactly generated triangulated category ''D'' is generated by a set of objects, then there is a [[Bousfield localization]] functor <math>L\\colon D\\to D</math> with kernel ''S''.<ref>Krause (2010), Theorem, Introduction.</ref> (That is, for every object ''X'' in ''D'' there is an exact triangle <math>Y\\to X\\to LX\\to Y[1]</math> with ''Y'' in ''S'' and ''LX'' in the [[semiorthogonal decomposition#Admissible subcategory|right orthogonal]] <math>S^{\\perp}</math>.) For example, this construction includes the [[localization of a topological space|localization]] of a spectrum at a prime number, or the restriction from a complex of sheaves on a space to an open subset.\n\nA parallel notion is more relevant for \"small\" triangulated categories: a '''thick subcategory''' of a triangulated category ''C'' is a strictly full triangulated subcategory that is closed under direct summands.

Prominent examples are the [[derived category]] of an [[abelian category]], as well as the [[stable homotopy category]]. The exact triangles generalize the [[short exact sequence]]s in an abelian category, as well as [[fibration sequence|fiber sequences]] and [[cofiber|cofiber sequences]] in topology. \n\nMuch of [[homological algebra]] is clarified and extended by the language of triangulated categories, an important example being the theory of [[sheaf cohomology]]. In the 1960s, a typical use of triangulated categories was to extend properties of sheaves on a space ''X'' to complexes of sheaves, viewed as objects of the derived category of sheaves on ''X''. More recently, triangulated categories have become objects of interest in their own right. Many equivalences between triangulated categories of different origins have been proved or conjectured. For example, the [[homological mirror symmetry]] conjecture predicts that the derived category of a [[Calabi\u2013Yau manifold]] is equivalent to the [[Fukaya category]] of its \"mirror\" [[symplectic manifold]].\n\n==History==\nTriangulated categories were introduced independently by Dieter Puppe (1962) and [[Jean-Louis Verdier]] (1963), although Puppe's axioms were less complete (lacking the octahedral axiom (TR 4)).<ref>Puppe (1962, 1967); Verdier (1963, 1967).</ref> Puppe was motivated by the stable homotopy category. Verdier's key example was the derived category of an abelian category, which he also defined, developing ideas of [[Alexander Grothendieck]]. The early applications of derived categories included [[coherent duality]] and [[Verdier duality]], which extends [[Poincar\u00e9 duality]] to singular spaces.\n\n==Definition==\nA '''shift''' or '''translation functor''' on a category ''D'' is an automorphism  (or for some authors, an auto-[[equivalence of categories|equivalence]]) <math>\\Sigma</math> from ''D'' to ''D''. It is common to write <math>X[n] =\\Sigma^n X</math> for integers ''n''.\n\nA '''triangle''' (''X'', ''Y'', ''Z'', ''u'', ''v'', ''w'') consists of three objects ''X'', ''Y'', and ''Z'', together with morphisms <math>u\\colon X\\to Y</math>, <math>v\\colon Y \\to Z</math> and <math>w\\colon Z\\to X[1]</math>. Triangles are generally written in the unravelled form:\n:<math>X \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop u} Y \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop v} Z \\xrightarrow {{} \\atop w} X[1],</math>\nor \n:<math>X \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop u} Y \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop v} Z \\xrightarrow {{} \\atop w} </math>\nfor short.\n\nA '''triangulated category''' is an [[additive category]] ''D'' with a translation functor and a class of triangles, called '''exact triangles'''<ref>Weibel (1994), Definition 10.2.1.</ref> (or '''distinguished triangles'''), satisfying the following properties (TR 1), (TR 2), (TR 3) and (TR 4). (These axioms are not entirely independent, since (TR 3) can be derived from the others.<ref>J. Peter May, [http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/MISC/Triangulate.pdf ''The axioms for triangulated categories''].</ref>)\n\n===TR 1===\n*For every object ''X'', the following triangle is exact:\n::<math>X \\overset{\\text{id}}{\\to} X \\to 0 \\to X[1]</math>\n*For every morphism <math>u\\colon X\\to Y</math>, there is an object ''Z'' (called a '''cone''' or '''cofiber''' of the morphism ''u'') fitting into an exact triangle\n::<math>X \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop u} Y \\to Z \\to X[1]</math>\n:The name \"cone\" comes from the [[mapping cone (homological algebra)|cone]] of a map of [[chain complex]]es, which in turn was inspired by the [[mapping cone (topology)|mapping cone]] in topology. It follows from the other axioms that an exact triangle (and in particular the object ''Z'') is determined up to isomorphism by the morphism <math>X\\to Y</math>, although not always up to a unique isomorphism.<ref name=\"cone\">Weibel (1994), Remark 10.2.2.</ref>\n* Every triangle isomorphic to an exact triangle is exact. This means that if\n::<math>X \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop u} Y \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop v} Z \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop w} X[1]</math>\n:is an exact triangle, and <math>f\\colon X\\to X'</math>, <math>g\\colon Y\\to Y'</math>, and <math>h\\colon Z\\to Z'</math> are isomorphisms, then\n::<math>X' \\xrightarrow{guf^{-1}} Y'\\xrightarrow{hvg^{-1}} Z' \\xrightarrow {f[1]wh^{-1}} X'[1]</math>\n:is also an exact triangle.\n\n===TR 2===\nIf \n:<math>X \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop u} Y \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop v} Z \\xrightarrow {{} \\atop w} X[1]</math>\nis an exact triangle, then so are the two rotated triangles \n:<math>Y \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop v} Z \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop w} X[1] \\xrightarrow{-u[1]} Y[1]</math>\nand\n:<math>Z[-1] \\xrightarrow{-w[-1]} X \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop u} Y \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop v} Z.\\ </math>\nIn view of the last triangle, the object ''Z''[\u22121] is called a '''fiber''' of the morphism <math>X\\to Y</math>.\n\nThe second rotated triangle has a more complex form when <math>[1]</math> and <math>[-1]</math> are not isomorphisms but only mutually inverse equivalences of categories, since <math>-w[-1]</math> is a morphism from <math>Z[-1]</math> to <math>(X[1])[-1]</math>, and to obtain a morphism to <math>[X]</math> one must compose with the natural transformation <math>(X[1])[-1] \\xrightarrow{} X</math>. This leads to complex questions about possible axioms one has to impose on the natural transformations making <math>[1]</math> and <math>[-1]</math> into a pair of inverse equivalences. Due to this issue, the assumption that <math>[1]</math> and <math>[-1]</math> are mutually inverse isomorphisms is the usual choice in the definition of a triangulated category.\n\n===TR 3===\nGiven two exact triangles and a map between the first morphisms in each triangle, there exists a morphism between the third objects in each of the two triangles that makes [[commutative diagram|everything commute]]. That is, in the following diagram (where the two rows are exact triangles and ''f'' and ''g'' are morphisms such that ''gu'' = ''u\u2032f''), there exists a map ''h'' (not necessarily unique) making all the squares commute:\n:[[Image:Axiom TR3.svg|300px]]\n\n===TR 4: The octahedral axiom===\nLet <math>u\\colon X\\to Y</math> and <math>v\\colon Y\\to Z</math> be morphisms, and consider the composed morphism <math>vu\\colon X\\to Z</math>. Form exact triangles for each of these three morphisms according to TR 1. The octahedral axiom states (roughly) that the three mapping cones can be made into the vertices of an exact triangle so that \"everything commutes\".\n\nMore formally, given exact triangles\n:<math>X \\xrightarrow{u\\,} Y \\xrightarrow{j} Z' \\xrightarrow {k} X[1]</math>\n:<math>Y \\xrightarrow{v\\,} Z \\xrightarrow{l} X' \\xrightarrow {i} Y[1]</math>\n:<math>X \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop vu} Z \\xrightarrow{m} Y' \\xrightarrow {n} X[1]</math>,\nthere exists an exact triangle\n:<math>Z' \\xrightarrow{f} Y' \\xrightarrow{g} X' \\xrightarrow {h} Z'[1]</math>\nsuch that\n:<math>l=gm,\\quad k=nf,\\quad h=j[1]i,\\quad ig=u[1]n,\\quad fj=mv.</math>\n\nThis axiom is called the \"octahedral axiom\" because drawing all the objects and morphisms gives the skeleton of an [[octahedron]], four of whose faces are exact triangles. The presentation here is Verdier's own, and appears, complete with octahedral diagram, in {{Harvard citations|last = Hartshorne|year = 1966}}.  In the following diagram, ''u'' and ''v'' are the given morphisms, and the primed letters are the cones of various maps (chosen so that every exact triangle has an ''X'', a ''Y'', and a ''Z'' letter).  Various arrows have been marked with [1] to indicate that they are of \"degree 1\"; e.g. the map from ''Z''\u2032 to ''X'' is in fact from ''Z''\u2032 to ''X''[1].  The octahedral axiom then asserts the existence of maps ''f'' and ''g'' forming an exact triangle, and so that ''f'' and ''g'' form commutative triangles in the other faces that contain them:\n:[[Image:Axiom TR4 (polyhedron).svg|250px]]\n\nTwo different pictures appear in {{Harvard citations|last1 = Beilinson|last2 = Bernstein|last3 = Deligne|year = 1982}} ({{Harvard citations|last1 = Gelfand|last2 = Manin|year = 2006|txt = yes}} also present the first one).  The first presents the upper and lower pyramids of the above octahedron and asserts that given a lower pyramid, one can fill in an upper pyramid so that the two paths from ''Y'' to ''Y''\u2032, and from ''Y''\u2032 to ''Y'', are equal (this condition is omitted, perhaps erroneously, from Hartshorne's presentation). The triangles marked + are commutative and those marked \"d\" are exact:\n:[[Image:Axiom TR4 (caps).svg|550px]]\nThe second diagram is a more innovative presentation. Exact triangles are presented linearly, and the diagram emphasizes the fact that the four triangles in the \"octahedron\" are connected by a series of maps of triangles, where three triangles (namely, those completing the morphisms from ''X'' to ''Y'', from ''Y'' to ''Z'', and from ''X'' to ''Z'') are given and the existence of the fourth is claimed. One passes between the first two by \"pivoting\" about ''X'', to the third by pivoting about ''Z'', and to the fourth by pivoting about ''X''\u2032. All enclosures in this diagram are commutative (both trigons and the square) but the other commutative square, expressing the equality of the two paths from ''Y''\u2032 to ''Y'', is not evident.  All the arrows pointing \"off the edge\" are degree 1:\n:[[Image:Axiom TR4 (BBD).svg|300px]]\nThis last diagram also illustrates a useful intuitive interpretation of the octahedral axiom.  In triangulated categories, triangles play the role of exact sequences, and so it is suggestive to think of these objects as \"quotients\", <math>Z' = Y/X</math> and <math>Y' = Z/X</math>. In those terms, the existence of the last triangle expresses on the one hand\n:<math>X' = Z/Y\\ </math> (looking at the triangle <math>Y \\to Z \\to X' \\to</math>&nbsp;), and\n:<math>X' = Y'/Z'</math> (looking at the triangle <math>Z' \\to Y' \\to X' \\to</math>&nbsp;).\nPutting these together, the octahedral axiom asserts the \"third isomorphism theorem\":\n:<math>(Z/X)/(Y/X)\\cong Z/Y.</math>\nIf the triangulated category is the derived category ''D''(''A'') of an abelian category ''A'', and ''X'', ''Y'', ''Z'' are objects of ''A'' viewed as complexes concentrated in degree 0, and the maps <math>X\\to Y</math> and <math>Y\\to Z</math> are monomorphisms in ''A'', then the cones of these morphisms in ''D''(''A'') are actually isomorphic to the quotients above in ''A''.\n\nFinally, {{Harvard citations|last = Neeman|year = 2001|txt = yes}} formulates the octahedral axiom using a two-dimensional commutative diagram with 4 rows and 4 columns. {{Harvard citations|last1 = Beilinson|last2 = Bernstein|last3 = Deligne|year = 1982|txt = yes}} also give generalizations of the octahedral axiom.\n\n==Properties==\nHere are some simple consequences of the axioms for a triangulated category ''D''.\n\n*Given an exact triangle\n::<math>X \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop u} Y \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop v} Z \\xrightarrow {{} \\atop w} X[1]</math>\n:in ''D'', the composition of any two successive morphisms is zero. That is, ''vu'' = 0, ''wv'' = 0, ''u''[1]''w'' = 0, and so on.<ref>Weibel (1994), Exercise 10.2.1.</ref>\n\n*Given a morphism <math>u\\colon X\\to Y</math>, TR 1 guarantees the existence of a cone ''Z'' completing an exact triangle. Any two cones of ''u'' are isomorphic, but the isomorphism is not always uniquely determined.<ref name=\"cone\" />\n\n*Every [[monomorphism]] in ''D'' is the inclusion of a direct summand, <math>X\\to X\\oplus Y</math>, and every [[epimorphism]] is a projection <math>X\\oplus Y\\to X</math>.<ref>Gelfand & Manin (2006), Exercise IV.1.1.</ref> A related point is that one should not talk about \"injectivity\" or \"surjectivity\" for  morphisms in a triangulated category. Every  morphism <math>X\\to Y</math> that is not an isomorphism has a nonzero \"cokernel\" ''Z'' (meaning that there is an exact triangle <math>X\\to Y\\to Z\\to X[1]</math>) and also a nonzero \"kernel\", namely ''Z''[\u22121].\n\n==Examples==\n{{Ordered list\n| [[Vector space]]s over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''k'' form an elementary triangulated category in which ''X''[1] {{=}} ''X'' for all ''X''. An exact triangle is a sequence <math>X \\to Y \\to Z \\to X \\to Y</math> of ''k''-linear maps (writing the same map <math>X\\to Y</math> twice) which is [[exact sequence|exact]] at ''X'', ''Y'' and ''Z''.\n\n| If ''A'' is an additive category (for example, an abelian category), define the [[homotopy category of chain complexes|homotopy category]] {{tmath|K(A)}} to have objects the [[chain complex|complexes]] in ''A'', and as morphisms the [[chain homotopy|homotopy classes]] of morphisms of complexes. Then {{tmath|K(A)}} is a triangulated category.<ref>Kashiwara & Schapira (2006), Theorem 11.2.6.</ref> The shift ''X''[1] is the complex ''X'' moved one step to the left (and with differentials multiplied by \u22121). An exact triangle in {{tmath|K(A)}} is a triangle which is isomorphic in {{tmath|K(A)}} to the triangle <math>X\\to Y\\to\\text{cone}(f)\\to X[1]</math> associated to some map <math>f\\colon X\\to Y</math> of chain complexes. (Here <math>\\text{cone}(f)</math> denotes the [[mapping cone (homological algebra)|mapping cone]] of a chain map.) \n\n| The [[derived category]] ''D''(''A'') of an abelian category ''A'' is a triangulated category.<ref>Weibel (1994), Corollary 10.4.3.</ref> It is constructed from the category of complexes ''C''(''A'') by [[localization of a category|localizing]] with respect to all [[quasi-isomorphism]]s. That is, formally adjoin an inverse morphism for every quasi-isomorphism. The objects of ''D''(''A'') are unchanged; that is, they are chain complexes. An exact triangle in ''D''(''A'') is a triangle which is isomorphic in ''D''(''A'') to the triangle <math>X\\to Y\\to\\text{cone}(f)\\to X[1]</math> associated to some map <math>f\\colon X\\to Y</math> of chain complexes.\n\n<br />A key motivation for the derived category is that [[derived functor]]s on ''A'' can be viewed as functors on the derived category.<ref>Weibel (1994), section 10.5.</ref> Some natural subcategories of ''D''(''A'') are also triangulated categories, for example the subcategory of complexes ''X'' whose cohomology objects <math>H^i(X)</math> in ''A'' vanish for ''i'' sufficiently negative, sufficiently positive, or both, called <math>D^+(A),D^-(A),D^{\\text{b}}(A)</math>, respectively.\n\n| In topology, the [[stable homotopy category]] <math>h\\cal{S}</math> is a triangulated category.<ref>Weibel (1994), Theorem 10.9.18.</ref> The objects are [[Spectrum (homotopy theory)|spectra]], the shift ''X''[1] is the [[suspension (topology)|suspension]] <math>\\Sigma X</math> (or equivalently the delooping <math>\\Omega^{-1}X</math>), and the exact triangles are the cofiber sequences. A distinctive feature of the stable homotopy category (compared to the [[homotopy category|unstable homotopy category]]) is that fiber sequences are the same as cofiber sequences. In fact, in any triangulated category, exact triangles can be viewed as fiber sequences and also as cofiber sequences.\n\n| In [[modular representation theory]] of a finite group ''G'', the [[stable module category]] StMod(''kG'') is a triangulated category. Its objects are the representations of ''G'' over a field ''k'', and the morphisms are the usual ones modulo those that factor via [[projective module|projective]] (or equivalently [[injective module|injective]]) ''kG''-modules. More generally, the stable module category is defined for any [[Frobenius algebra]] in place of ''kG''.\n}}\n\n==Are there better axioms?==\nSome experts suspect (see, for example, {{Harvard citations|last1 = Gelfand|last2 = Manin|year = 2006|loc1 = Introduction|loc2 = Chapter IV}}) that triangulated categories are not really the \"correct\" concept. The essential reason is that the cone of a morphism is unique only up to a ''non-unique'' isomorphism. In particular, the cone of a morphism does not in general depend [[functor]]ially on the morphism (note the non-uniqueness in axiom (TR 3), for example). This non-uniqueness is a potential source of errors. The axioms work adequately in practice, however, and there is a great deal of literature devoted to their study.\n\nOne alternative proposal is the theory of [[derivator]]s initiated by Grothendieck in 1991. Another is that of [[stable \u221e-category|stable \u221e-categories]]. The homotopy category of a stable \u221e-category is canonically triangulated, and moreover mapping cones become essentially unique (in a precise homotopical sense).  Moreover, a stable \u221e-category naturally encodes a whole hierarchy of compatibilities for its homotopy category, at the bottom of which sits the octahedral axiom. Thus, it is strictly stronger to give the data of a stable \u221e-category than to give the data of a triangulation of its homotopy category. Nearly all triangulated categories that arise in practice come from stable \u221e-categories. A similar (but more special) enrichment of triangulated categories is the notion of a [[dg-category]].\n\nIn some ways, stable \u221e-categories or dg-categories work better than triangulated categories. One example is the notion of an exact functor between triangulated categories, discussed below. For a [[smooth scheme|smooth]] [[projective variety]] ''X'' over a field ''k'', the bounded derived category of [[coherent sheaves]] <math>\\text{D}^{\\text{b}}(X)</math> comes from a dg-category in a natural way. For varieties ''X'' and ''Y'', every functor from the dg-category of ''X'' to that of ''Y'' comes from a complex of sheaves on <math>X\\times Y</math> by the [[Fourier\u2013Mukai transform]].<ref>To\u00ebn (2007), Theorem 8.15.</ref> By contrast, there is an example of an exact functor from <math>\\text{D}^{\\text{b}}(X)</math> to <math>\\text{D}^{\\text{b}}(Y)</math> that does not come from a complex of sheaves on <math>X\\times Y</math>.<ref>Rizzardo et al. (2019), Theorem 1.4.</ref> In view of this example, the \"right\" notion of a morphism between triangulated categories seems to be one that comes from a morphism of underlying dg-categories (or stable \u221e-categories).\n\nAnother advantage of stable \u221e-categories or dg-categories over triangulated categories appears in [[algebraic K-theory]]. One can define the algebraic K-theory of a stable \u221e-category or dg-category ''C'', giving a sequence of abelian groups <math>K_i(C)</math> for integers ''i''. The group <math>K_0(C)</math> has a simple description in terms of the triangulated category associated to ''C''. But an example shows that the higher K-groups of a dg-category are not always determined by the associated triangulated category.<ref>Dugger & Shipley (2009), Remark 4.9.</ref> Thus a triangulated category has a well-defined <math>K_0</math> group, but in general not higher K-groups.\n \nOn the other hand, the theory of triangulated categories is simpler than the theory of stable \u221e-categories or dg-categories, and in many applications the triangulated structure is sufficient. An example is the proof of the [[Bloch\u2013Kato conjecture]], where many computations were done at the level of triangulated categories, and the additional structure of \u221e-categories or dg-categories was not required.\n\n==Cohomology in triangulated categories==\nTriangulated categories admit a notion of cohomology, and every triangulated category has a large supply of cohomological functors. A '''cohomological functor''' ''F'' from a triangulated category ''D'' to an abelian category ''A'' is a functor such that for every exact triangle\n:<math>X \\to Y \\to Z \\to X[1],\\ </math>\nthe sequence <math>F(X)\\to F(Y)\\to F(Z)</math> in ''A'' is exact. Since an exact triangle determines an infinite sequence of exact triangles in both directions,\n:<math>\\cdots\\to Z[-1]\\to X\\to Y \\to Z \\to X[1] \\to\\cdots,\\ </math>\na cohomological functor ''F'' actually gives a [[long exact sequence]] in the abelian category ''A'':\n:<math>\\cdots\\to F(Z[-1])\\to F(X)\\to F(Y)\\to F(Z)\\to F(X[1])\\to\\cdots.\\ </math>\n\nA key example is: for each object ''B'' in a triangulated category ''D'', the functors <math>\\operatorname{Hom}(B, \\text{-})</math> and <math>\\operatorname{Hom}(\\text{-}, B)</math> are cohomological, with values in the category of [[abelian group]]s.<ref>Weibel (1994), Example 10.2.8.</ref> (To be precise, the latter is a [[contravariant functor]], which can be considered as a functor on the [[opposite category]] of ''D''.) That is, an exact triangle <math>X\\to Y\\to Z\\to X[1]</math> determines two long exact sequences of abelian groups:\n:<math>\\cdots \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(B,X[i])\\to \\operatorname{Hom}(B,Y[i])\\to \\operatorname{Hom}(B,Z[i])\\to \\operatorname{Hom}(B,X[i+1])\\to\\cdots</math>\nand\n:<math>\\cdots\\to\\operatorname{Hom}(Z,B[i])\\to\\operatorname{Hom}(Y,B[i])\\to\\operatorname{Hom}(X,B[i])\\to\\operatorname{Hom}(Z,B[i+1])\\to\\cdots.</math>\nFor particular triangulated categories, these exact sequences yield many of the important exact sequences in sheaf cohomology, [[group cohomology]], and other areas of mathematics.\n\nOne may also use the notation\n:<math>\\operatorname{Ext}^i(B,X)=\\operatorname{Hom}(B,X[i])</math>\nfor integers ''i'', generalizing the [[Ext functor]] in an abelian category. In this notation, the first exact sequence above would be written:\n:<math>\\cdots \\to \\operatorname{Ext}^i(B,X) \\to \\operatorname{Ext}^i(B,Y) \\to \\operatorname{Ext}^i(B,Z) \\to \\operatorname{Ext}^{i+1}(B,X)\\to\\cdots.\\ </math>\n\nFor an abelian category ''A'', another basic example of a cohomological functor on the derived category ''D''(''A'') sends a complex ''X'' to the object <math>H^0(X)</math> in ''A''. That is, an exact triangle <math>X\\to Y\\to Z\\to X[1]</math> in ''D''(''A'') determines a long exact sequence in ''A'':\n:<math>\\cdots\\to H^i(X)\\to H^i(Y)\\to H^i(Z)\\to H^{i+1}(X)\\to\\cdots,</math>\nusing that <math>H^0(X[i])\\cong H^i(X)</math>.\n\n==Exact functors and equivalences==\nAn '''exact functor''' (also called '''triangulated functor''') from a triangulated category ''D'' to a triangulated category ''E'' is an additive functor <math>F\\colon D\\to E</math> which, loosely speaking, commutes with translation and sends exact triangles to exact triangles.<ref>Weibel (1994), Definition 10.2.6.</ref>\n\nIn more detail, an exact functor comes with a [[natural transformation|natural isomorphism]] <math>\\eta\\colon F\\Sigma\\to \\Sigma F</math> (where the first <math>\\Sigma</math> denotes the translation functor of ''D'' and the second <math>\\Sigma</math> denotes the translation functor of ''E''), such that whenever\n:<math>X \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop u} Y \\xrightarrow{{} \\atop v} Z \\xrightarrow {{} \\atop w} X[1]</math> \nis an exact triangle in ''D'',\n:<math>F(X) \\xrightarrow{F(u)} F(Y) \\xrightarrow{F(v)} F(Z) \\xrightarrow {\\eta_X F(w)} F(X)[1]</math> \nis an exact triangle in ''E''.\n\nAn '''equivalence''' of triangulated categories is an exact functor <math>F\\colon D\\to E</math> that is also an [[equivalence of categories]]. In this case, there is an exact functor <math>G\\colon E\\to D</math> such that ''FG'' and ''GF'' are naturally isomorphic to the respective identity functors.\n\n==Compactly generated triangulated categories==\nLet ''D'' be a triangulated category such that [[direct sum]]s indexed by an arbitrary set (not necessarily finite) exist in ''D''. An object ''X'' in ''D'' is called '''compact''' if the functor <math>\\text{Hom}_D(X,\\text{-})</math> commutes with direct sums. Explicitly, this means that for every family of objects <math>Y_i</math> in ''D'' indexed by a set ''S'', the natural homomorphism of abelian groups <math>\\oplus_{i\\in S}\\mathrm{Hom}_D(X,Y_i)\\to\\mathrm{Hom}_D(X,\\oplus_{i\\in S}Y_i)</math> is an isomorphism. This is different from the general notion of a [[compact object (category theory)|compact object]] in category theory, which involves all colimits rather than only coproducts.\n\nFor example, a compact object in the stable homotopy category <math>h\\cal{S}</math> is a finite spectrum.<ref>Neeman (2001), Remark D.1.5.</ref> A compact object in the derived category of a ring, or in the [[quasi-coherent sheaf|quasi-coherent]] derived category of a scheme, is a [[perfect complex]]. In the case of a smooth projective variety ''X'' over a field, the category Perf(''X'') of perfect complexes can also be viewed as the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves, <math>D^{\\text{b}}_{\\text{coh}}(X)</math>.\n\nA triangulated category ''D'' is '''compactly generated''' if \n* ''D'' has arbitrary (not necessarily finite) direct sums;\n* There is a set ''S'' of compact objects in ''D'' such that for every nonzero object ''X'' in ''D'', there is an object ''Y'' in ''S'' with a nonzero map <math>Y[n]\\to X</math> for some integer ''n''.\n\nMany naturally occurring \"large\" triangulated categories are compactly generated:\n* The derived category of modules over a ring ''R'' is compactly generated by one object, the ''R''-module ''R''.\n* The quasi-coherent derived category of a [[quasi-compact morphism|quasi-compact]] [[quasi-separated scheme]] is compactly generated by one object.<ref>{{Citation | title=Stacks Project, Tag 09IS | url=http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/09IS}}, {{Citation | title=Stacks Project, Tag 09M1 | url=http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/09M1}}.</ref>\n* The stable homotopy category is compactly generated by one object, the sphere spectrum <math>S^0</math>.<ref>Neeman (2001), Lemma D.1.3.</ref>\n\nAmnon Neeman generalized the [[Brown representability theorem]] to any compactly generated triangulated category, as follows.<ref name=\"grduality\">Neeman (1996), Theorems 3.1 and 4.1.</ref> Let ''D'' be a compactly generated triangulated category, <math>H\\colon D^{\\text{op}}\\to\\text{Ab}</math> a cohomological functor which takes coproducts to products. Then ''H'' is representable. (That is, there is an object ''W'' of ''D'' such that <math>H(X)\\cong\\text{Hom}(X,W)</math> for all ''X''.) For another version, let ''D'' be a compactly generated triangulated category, ''T'' any triangulated category. If an exact functor <math>F\\colon D\\to T</math> sends coproducts to coproducts, then ''F'' has a [[adjoint functors|right adjoint]].\n\nThe Brown representability theorem can be used to define various functors between triangulated categories. In particular, Neeman used it to simplify and generalize the construction of the [[exceptional inverse image functor]] <math>f^!</math> for a morphism ''f'' of [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]], the central feature of [[coherent duality]] theory.<ref>Neeman (1996), Example 4.2.</ref>\n\n==t-structures==\n{{main|t-structure}}\nFor every abelian category ''A'', the derived category ''D''(''A'') is a triangulated category, containing ''A'' as a full subcategory (the complexes concentrated in degree zero). Different abelian categories can have equivalent derived categories, so that it is not always possible to reconstruct ''A'' from ''D''(''A'') as a triangulated category.\n\n[[Alexander Beilinson]], [[Joseph Bernstein]] and [[Pierre Deligne]] described this situation by the notion of a ''t-structure'' on a triangulated category ''D''.<ref>Beilinson et al. (1982), Definition 1.3.1.</ref> A t-structure on ''D'' determines an abelian category inside ''D'', and different t-structures on ''D'' may yield different abelian categories.\n\n==Localizing and thick subcategories==\nLet ''D'' be a triangulated category with arbitrary direct sums. A '''localizing subcategory''' of ''D'' is a [[strictly full subcategory|strictly full]] triangulated subcategory that is closed under arbitrary direct sums.<ref>Neeman (2001), Introduction, after Remark 1.4.</ref> To explain the name: if a localizing subcategory ''S'' of a compactly generated triangulated category ''D'' is generated by a set of objects, then there is a [[Bousfield localization]] functor <math>L\\colon D\\to D</math> with kernel ''S''.<ref>Krause (2010), Theorem, Introduction.</ref> (That is, for every object ''X'' in ''D'' there is an exact triangle <math>Y\\to X\\to LX\\to Y[1]</math> with ''Y'' in ''S'' and ''LX'' in the [[semiorthogonal decomposition#Admissible subcategory|right orthogonal]] <math>S^{\\perp}</math>.) For example, this construction includes the [[localization of a topological space|localization]] of a spectrum at a prime number, or the restriction from a complex of sheaves on a space to an open subset.\n\nA parallel notion is more relevant for \"small\" triangulated categories: a '''thick subcategory''' of a triangulated category ''C'' is a strictly full triangulated subcategory that is closed under direct summands. (If ''C'' is [[pseudo-abelian category|idempotent-complete]], a subcategory is thick if and only if it is also idempotent-complete.) A localizing subcategory is thick.<ref>Neeman (2001), Remark 3.2.7.</ref> So if ''S'' is a localizing subcategory of a triangulated category ''D'', then the intersection of ''S'' with the subcategory <math>D^{\\text{c}}</math> of compact objects is a thick subcategory of <math>D^{\\text{c}}</math>.\n\nFor example, Devinatz\u2013[[Michael J. Hopkins|Hopkins]]\u2013Smith described all thick subcategories of the triangulated category of finite spectra in terms of [[Morava K-theory]].<ref>Ravenel (1992), Theorem 3.4.3.</ref> The localizing subcategories of the whole stable homotopy category have not been classified.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Fourier\u2013Mukai transform]]\n*[[Six operations]]\n*[[Perverse sheaf]]\n*[[D-module]]\n*[[Beilinson\u2013Bernstein localization]]\n*[[Module spectrum]]\n*[[Semiorthogonal decomposition]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30}}\n\n== References ==\nSome textbook introductions to triangulated categories are:\n* {{Citation\n| last1 = Gelfand\n| first1 = Sergei\n| last2 = Manin\n| first2 = Yuri\n| author2-link = Yuri Manin\n| title = Methods of homological algebra\n| year = 2006\n| edition = 2nd\n| series = Springer Monographs in Mathematics\n| publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer-Verlag]]\n| isbn = 978-3540435839\n| chapter = IV.
