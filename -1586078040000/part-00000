The feasibility of expanding the terminal building is being studied. If that is not possible, new building will be constructed, which is already in the airport master plan.\nThe number of international passengers handled at the airport would decide on having a separate international terminal or an integrated terminal. At present, the airport could handle 250 passengers each at arrival and departure halls.<ref name=\"thehindu1\"/> To cater the immediate requirement, 7 new aprons are being added to the airport.\n\nAAI had asked around 610 acres of land in Madurai to take up runway extension work. The state government has promised that land will be acquired and handed over on time. In response to that, the district administration has proposed to acquire 610 acres to expand Madurai International Airport. The proposed site, including 100 acres of poromboke (non-fertile) land, would pave way for extending the runway to 12,500&nbsp;ft enabling the airport to handle overseas services.\n\nA team comprising the Airports Authority of India, Highways Department, and Madurai Corporation officials had identified the site on the eastern side of the airport that would intersect the Ring Road over 5&nbsp;km.

The feasibility of expanding the terminal building is being studied. If that is not possible, new building will be constructed, which is already in the airport master plan.\nThe number of international passengers handled at the airport would decide on having a separate international terminal or an integrated terminal. At present, the airport could handle 250 passengers each at arrival and departure halls.<ref name=\"thehindu1\"/> To cater the immediate requirement, 7 new aprons are being added to the airport.\n\nAAI had asked around 610 acres of land in Madurai to take up runway extension work. The state government has promised that land will be acquired and handed over on time. In response to that, the district administration has proposed to acquire 610 acres to expand Madurai International Airport. The proposed site, including 100 acres of poromboke (non-fertile) land, would pave way for extending the runway to 12,500&nbsp;ft enabling the airport to handle overseas services.\n\nA team comprising the Airports Authority of India, Highways Department, and Madurai Corporation officials had identified the site on the eastern side of the airport that would intersect the Ring Road over 5&nbsp;km. As per the plan, the Ring Road would be disconnected at Mandela Junction and diverted via Perungudi and Avaniapuram to connect the Tuticorin Road.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/03/28/stories/2008032856770100.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Madurai airport expansion planned | date=28 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe AAI had also proposed to have a new technical building with a control tower.
