These beliefs have been termed \"Chabad messianism\", and those subscribing to the beliefs have been termed ''Meshichists'' (messianists). A number of Jewish leaders have publicly voiced their concerns and/or opposition towards certain aspects of Chabad messianism.\n\nA chant recited by a number of Chabad messianists proclaiming Schneerson as the messiah is the \"Yechi\".<ref>The full text is \"''Yechi Adoneinu Moreinu v'Rabbeinu Melech haMoshiach l'olam vo'ed''\" (\"Long Live our Master, our Teacher, and our Rabbi, King Messiah, for ever and ever).</ref> Customs vary among messianists as to when the phrase is recited.\n\nMessianic beliefs concerning Schneerson vary a great deal. Controversy exists over whether he actually died and will be resurrected as the Messiah, or whether he is simply \"in hiding\" until his final advent. To date, no study reports the number of Chabad Hasidim who hold these beliefs.<ref name=\"Identifying Chabad-p30\">{{cite book|title=Identifying Chabad: What they Teach and How they Influence the Torah World.|date=2007|publisher=Center for Torah Demographics|location=Illinois|isbn=978-1411642416|page=30|edition=Revised|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=-_4eAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA13&dq=|accessdate=29 June 2016}} ( \"[[Chabad philosophy#Roles of rebbe and hasid|Hiskashrus]]\")</ref>\n\nThe concept that the Messiah can come at any given moment is a basic tenet of Judaism.

Schneerson]]'s life, some of his supporters thought that he could be revealed as the ''mashiach'' ([[Messiah in Judaism|Messiah]]). There were many [[Chabad]] Hasidim who proclaimed this very passionately. The concept that a righteous Jewish leader may be revealed as the Messiah was believed by many rabbis and scholars regarding their own leaders throughout Jewish history.<ref name=tablet/>\n\nThis idea finds its earliest roots in an early 4th century discussion in the [[Talmud]]: After schools of various prominent rabbis each cite proof-texts that the name of the Messiah is indeed that of their very own teacher, Rabbi Nachman says, \"If he [the Messiah] is among the living, he is someone like me.\" The Talmud then cites the sage Rav: \"If the Messiah is among the living, then he is someone like our holy Rabbi [i.e., Rabbi Judah, the editor of the Mishnah]. [And] if he is from among the dead, he is someone like Daniel.\"<ref name=\"Sanhedrin 98b\">Sanhedrin 98b</ref>\n\n[[Maimonides]] ruled the following as the definitive criteria for identifying the ''mashiach'': If we see a Jewish leader who (a) toils in the study of Torah and is meticulous about the observance of the mitzvot, (b) compels the Jews to follow the ways of the Torah and (c) wages the \"battles of God\"\u2014such a person is the \"presumed mashiach\".<ref name=\"Rambam\">Mishneh Torah, Law of Kings, 9:4, Maimonides</ref> If the person succeeded in all these endeavors, and then rebuilds the Holy Temple in Jerusalem and facilitates the in-gathering of the Jews to the Land of Israel\u2014then we are certain that he is the \"actual mashiach\".<ref name=\"Rambam\"/><ref name=\"Davidson\">{{cite book |last1=Davidson |first1=Herbert A. |title=Moses Maimonides: The Man and His Works |date=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=9780195173215 |page=492 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Qnw8DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA492&dq=Maimonides+criteria+for+identifying+the+mashiach#v=onepage&q=Maimonides%20criteria%20for%20identifying%20the%20mashiach&f=false |language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Chezkat Mashiach and Mashiach Vadai===\nAccording to Maimonides there are two forms of the Messiah. The presumed messiah, known as the \"Chezkat Mashiach\" and the actual messiah, known as the \"Mashiach Vadai\".<ref>Rambam. Hilchot Melachim, Laws of Kings. 4.</ref>\n\n===''Mashiach shebador''===\nIn addition, a number of Talmudic texts, and subsequent writings of ''[[Halakha|halakhic]]'' (Jewish law) authorities, speak of this that in every generation there is always one person who is worthy and has the potential of being the Messiah, and will redeem the Jewish people, should they be deserving.<ref name=\"chabad.org\"/>\n\nThis third form of the messiah is referred to in ''halakhic'' writings as the ''Mashiach shebador'', meaning the messiah of the generation. According to the [[Chatam Sofer]]: \"In every generation there is one righteous man ([[tzaddik]]) who merits to be the Messiah... and when the time comes, God will reveal Himself to him and send him.\"<ref>Responsa Chatam Sofer VI:98</ref> According to [[Chaim Hezekiah Medini]], not only is there such a figure in each generation, but this figure was sometimes explicitly identified as such. \"They assumed who it [Messiah] may be... Rabbi Judah the prince... in his generation they said and knew that it was he who was worthy... and [he goes through a few other generations and then adds] based on this the disciples of the [[Arizal]] wrote that in his time it was him. All this is simple and straightforward.\"<ref>Peat Hasadeh section 1 rule 70</ref>\n\n===Anticipation===\n[[File:Chofetzreal.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Yisrael Meir Kagan]] (1838-1933)]]\nAnticipation for the coming of the ''mashiach'', and belief in the imminent arrival, has been on the hearts and minds of Jews through the past two millennia. Maimonides ruled that all Jews must believe with perfect faith, each day, that the ''mashiach'' will come and the resurrection of the dead will take place. He rules that anyone who does not believe this, denies the entire Torah.<ref>Maimonides Laws of Kings 11:1</ref> [[Yisrael Meir Kagan]] wrote \"our days are the days of Messiah\u2019s coming. Hear my brothers and friends; these are the days of Messiah. It is clear that our days are the days of Messiah\u2019s coming,\"<ref>Likutei Michtavim page 4</ref> and [[Moshe Feinstein]], wrote that \"we are obligated to anticipate the arrival of the Messiah on any given day as a near certainty.\"\n\n==Messianism in Hasidism==\n\n===Background===\nHasidim in general, focused very much on the ''mashiach'' and future redemption. In a vision in which [[Baal Shem Tov]], the founder of Hasidism, encountered the ''mashiach'', the former asked the latter when he will come. The ''mashiach'' answered \"when your teachings [of Hasidism] will be spread forth\". Many Hasidic discourses speak of the need to refine the world and prepare it for its ultimate perfectness when the ''mashiach'' will come.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1600969/jewish/Chassidut.htm|website=Chabad.org |title=What is Chassidut? |first=Tzvi |last=Friedman |access-date=17 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nThroughout Hasidic history, there have also been numerous cases of Rebbes that have been identified by their Hasidim as worthy of being the Messiah. These figures were not thought of having been the actual Messiah, since the criteria that must be fulfilled by the Messiah have been clearly stipulated by Maimonides. Followers hoped that it would be their leader who would be the Messiah and occasionally spoke of him as the Messiah.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}<ref>Yitzchak keller, Moshiach Bedor, 1991.</ref>\n\n[[Julius Eisenstein|Yehuda Eisenstein]] records in his book Otzer Yisrael, that followers of Hasidic Rebbes strongly hope that their leader will be the one God chooses to be the Messiah \"the chasidim believe, that even though there are many righteous people in the generation, each of whom is exceptional in his way of divine service and righteousness, each of whom has godly powers of spirituality, nevertheless there is always one who is above all the rest, he is the one who is the tzadik of the generation. He is the one who is the messiah of the generation.\"<ref name=\"EncyclopediaOY\">{{cite book|title=Otzer Yisroel|first=Yehuda|last=Eisenstein|date=1907}}</ref>{{page needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n===Messianism in Chabad===\nAs with other Hasidic groups,<ref name=\"EncyclopediaOY\"/>{{page needed|date=September 2015}} Chabad Hasidim had a history of hoping that their Rebbes would be the Messiah. Schneerson himself spoke of his father-in-law, [[Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn]], as the mashiach of his generation. In addition, the Chabad Rebbes often spoke with great passion about the coming of the redemption and the Messiah's imminent arrival.<ref name=\"scribd.com\"/>\n\nIn a speech he gave in 1942, [[Joseph Ber Soloveitchik]] praised the efforts of the Chabad Lubavitch campaign to raise awareness to the coming of the ''mashiach''. Soloveitchik said, \"The Lubavitcher Rebbe speaks and publicizes about the Mashiach and a tumult has erupted, an uproar and an outcry. What is wrong, I ask? That people who are heretics decry him; I understand. That those who violate the [[Shabbat]] decry him; I understand. But that those who study the Talumud and Chassidus decry him; this is inconceivable...Are we not allowed to talk about the belief in the Mashiach anymore?\"<ref>Yosef Dov Soloveitchick. Oiystzug Fun Der Rede 1943</ref>\n\nAfter the passing of his father-in-law [[Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn]], his gravesite, known as \"the ''[[Ohel (Chabad)|Ohel]]'',\" became a central point of focus for Menachem Mendel Schneerson, who would visit it regularly for many hours of prayer, meditation, and supplication for Jews all over the world. The then seventh ''Rebbe'' of Chabad, Menachem Mendel Schneerson, openly declared his deceased father-in-law, the former ''Rebbe'' of Chabad Lubavitch, to be the ''mashiach''.<ref name=\"LubavitcherFalseMessiahs\">{{cite web|last1=Bar-Hayim|first1=HaRav David|title=The False Mashiah of Lubavitch-Habad|url=http://machonshilo.org/en/eng/list-ask-the-rav/31-general/424-the-false-mashiah-of-lubavitch-habad|publisher=Machon Shilo (Shilo Institute)|accessdate=17 June 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"MS-HabadMinuth\">{{cite web|last1=Bar-Hayim|first1=HaRav David|title=Habad and Jewish Messianism (audio)|url=http://machonshilo.org/en/eng/list-audio-shiurim/41-audiohalakha/475-habad-and-jewish-messianism|publisher=Machon Shilo (Shilo Institute)|access-date=17 June 2016}}</ref> Until today, followers of Chabad ''[[hashkafa]]'' (worldview) imitate the manners of their deceased seventh Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson.\n\n==During Schneerson's life==\n\n===Schneerson's passion for the imminent arrival of the Messiah===\n[[File:FrierdigerRebbePassportPic.jpg|thumb|right|[[Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn]] (1880-1950)]]\nAfter [[Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn]] died in 1950, his son-in-law, Menachem M. Schneerson, soon became the seventh Rebbe. The Rebbe was a passionate believer in the coming of the ''mashiach''. In a letter to Israeli President [[Yitzhak Ben-Zvi]], Schneerson wrote: \"From the time that I was a child attending Cheder, and even before, the vision of the future Redemption began to take form in my imagination -- the Redemption of the Jewish people from their final Exile, a redemption of such magnitude and grandeur through which the purpose of the suffering, the harsh decrees, and annihilation of Exile will be understood.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/177352/lubavitcher-rebbe|title=Who Was the Lubavitcher Rebbe?|work=Tablet Magazine|accessdate=23 December 2014}}</ref> Schneerson also encouraged people to focus on Messiah very much. Beginning with his very first farbrengen as Rebbe, he spoke of this generation's mission to complete the ''[[Dira Betachtonim]]'', and urged everyone to do all within their power to help the world reach its ultimate state of perfection, when Godliness and goodness will be naturally apparent and prevalent, with the final redemption.<ref name=\"Adin Steinsaltz My Rebbe page 173\">Adin Steinsaltz, ''My Rebbe,'' page 173.</ref>\n\nSchneerson would finish almost every public talk of his with a prayer for the imminent arrival of the Messiah. As early as the 1970s, he sought to raise awareness of the Messianic age by encouraging people to learn and become knowledgeable in the laws of the [[Holy Temple]], laws that will only apply when the Messiah actually comes. In this connection, he quoted from earlier rabbinic opinion that learning about the redemption would raise awareness of and could actually bring the Messiah sooner.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Schneerson would frequently quote the many sages who stated that this generation was the last generation of the exile and would be the first generation of redemption and would quote the Chafetz Chaim and others, who stated that actively asking for the Messiah's coming is crucial.<ref>Adin Steinsaltz, My Rebbe, page 178</ref>\n\n===Criticism of Schneerson's passion for the arrival of the Messiah===\nAs Schneerson's passion about the need for Messiah became more well-known, criticism also built up. In 1980, a group of children from a Chabad summer camp composed a song with the words \"am yisrael [nation of Israel] have no fear, Moshiach will be here this year, we want Moshiach now, we don\u2019t want to wait.\" Schneerson seems to have received great satisfaction from the children's initiative, and greatly encouraged their song.<ref name=\"Telushkin431\">Telushkin, ''Rebbe:'' p. 431</ref>\n\nIn light of some criticism about the insistent tone of these words, on one occasion he explained \"This has always been the hope and yearning of the Jewish people \u2013 that the Messiah should come now, immediately. Therefore it is inappropriate for someone to say that he does not want, or that he does not agree, or that he is not comfortable that people are imploring 'we want moshiach now.' Each Jew clearly prays and pleads three times a day in the amida, while standing before the Al-mighty (at that time a person is certainly speaking the truth, and saying what he means) ''et tzemach David avdecha me\u2019hera tatzmiach'' [that we merit the final redemption and coming of the Messiah speedily], and then continues ''ki lishuatcha kivinu kol hayom'', that he hopes for this the entire day!\"<ref>Likutei Sichot vol. 20 pp. 458-459</ref>\n\nSchneerson urged and talked about purifying all parts of the world through Torah and [[Mitzvah]]s (commandments) in order to bring Mashiach. Many times he would weep publicly about the deep slumber and exile we are in, and how urgent it is that God redeem us, both for our sake as well as even for His own.<ref>Adin Steinsaltz My Rebbe page 174</ref>\n\nNevertheless, criticism of his passion about the coming of the Messiah and, his urging people to do all they could to bring about the redemption by adding in the observance of Torah and Mitzvahs, was something that was known to him. On one occasion he even remarked \"I have merited that the complaint people have against me is that I am passionate about the Mashiach.\"<ref name=\"Telushkin431\"/>\n\n===Talk of Schneerson as the Messiah===\n[[File:Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson2 crop.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Menachem M. Schneerson]] (1902-1994)]]\nMany Hasidim of the seventh Rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneerson felt that he is the ''mashiach'' of the generation, even though he never said so himself.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Chabad's Messianism and Israeli Radicals. Azure no. 41.</ref>\n\nAccording to research by [[Rachel Elior]], the belief that the Rebbe would be the Messiah built up during the 1980s. She asserts that messianism can be traced back even to the previous Lubavitcher Rebbe, but cites evidence that the 1980s saw an upsurge. Nevertheless, this hope was initially kept to a hush.<ref>\"The Lubavitch Messianic Resurgence: The Historical and Mystical Background 1939\u20131996\", Rachel Elior in ''Toward the Millennium: Messianic Expectations from the Bible to Waco'' ed. Peter Sch\u00e4fer and Mark Cohen, 383\u2013408. (Leiden: Brill, 1998)</ref>\n\n[[Shalom Dov Wolpo]] brought up the issue in 1984 by publishing a booklet declaring Schneerson to be the Messiah. Schneerson responded by banning the publication and forbidding Wolpo from involvement with any Messiah related topics.<ref>''The Revelation of Melech HaMashiach (King Messiah), \"Yechi HaMelech\"'', Sholom Ber Wolpo, \"The Committee for Fulfilling the Rebbe's Directives\"</ref> Wolpo would later argue that despite the Rebbe's strong opposition, \"everyone must still consider and proclaim the Rebbe as the Messiah\" arguing that \"acceptance of the Messiah must be done by the people not by the King\".<ref>Telushkin, ''Rebbe:'' p. 429</ref>\n\nAs the years went on, and recognition of Schneerson as being so toweringly unique, a Rebbe of truly unprecedented and universally recognized stature, spread ever further, this messianic speculation spread to greater numbers and higher volume than in previous generations. The Hasidim became vocal of their hope that Schneerson would be the one to be the Messiah.<ref name=\"scribd.com\"/>\n\nChaim Bergstein was quoted{{where|date=January 2015}} as saying \"I'm not saying he is or isn't Mashiach, but there is no one as learned ... in this generation.\" ''Time'' magazine journalist [[Lisa Beyer]] reported that [[Adin Even-Yisrael]] said he wished that Schneerson should be revealed as the Messiah.\"<ref>\"[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,975127,00.html Expecting the Messiah] \u2014 An Ultra-Orthodox sect says the Redeemer is due to arrive any day now \u2014 and he might be an American\" ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, Lisa Beyer, March 23, 1992] (paywalled).</ref> Even Rabbi [[Yehuda Krinsky]] told ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1988: \"Our sages tell us that the Messiah is a man of flesh and blood who lives among us...

That year, Avraham Parizh printed letters that spoke of Schneerson as the Messiah and started handing them out in Israel. When Schneerson learned of this, he immediately dispatch a telegram to Parizh in Israel saying that he was \"shocked by the letter [you wrote and disseminated]\" and asked that Parizh \"immediately cease distributing it.\" Schneerson instructed Parizh to \"gather and send to all extant copies of the letter, every last one, and please confirm immediately that you have fulfilled this instruction.\"<ref>Echad Hoyo Avrohom Page 160</ref>\n\nIn 1984, Sholom Dov Wolpo published a booklet identifying Schneerson as the Messiah. Schneerson publicly denounced these actions several times. During one of these talks he said that those involved [in the publication] were starting a new war against Chabad, and that he should never have to speak about it again. On Shabbat Bereshit, when Wolpo began singing a song that had long been popular in Lubavitch, which referred to Schneerson as the Messiah, he abruptly stopped the singing and ordered that it never be sung again.<ref>''Sefer Hisva'aduyos'' 5745, Vol. 1, p. 465</ref>\n\nIn 1991, Aharon Dov Halprin, the editor of Israeli magazine ''Kfar Chabad'', prepared an article that explained why the Rebbe was worthy of being considered Messiah. When the Rebbe got word of this he responded sharply, \"If you, God forbid, [plan to] do anything even remotely similar, it is preferable that you shut down the periodical completely\".{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nOn a number of occasions Schneerson said that rabbis should issue a ''[[Posek|psak din]]'' (ruling) that Moshiach must come. In 1988,[[Yitzchak Hendel]] issued a ruling stating, not that the Messiah must come, but that the Rebbe was to be the Messiah. When the Rebbe saw the ruling, he responded to Hendel and wrote ''me\u2019heichan dantuni?'' (Talmudic term connoting: On what basis have you ruled against me?) Is this the standard of all your rabbinic rulings!?\"<ref>Cheshbono shel Olom page 56.</ref>\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, Schneerson's talks became increasingly focused on the topic of Moshiach, that Moshiach was about to come, and what was needed to accomplish this. These talks would often take on a sense of urgency. This, coupled with Schneerson's frequent statement that ours is the \"Last Generation of ''[[Jewish diaspora|galut]]'' (exile) and it is the first generation of ''[[geulah]]'', the redemption\" is one of the arguments put forward{{by whom|date=December 2014}} that the Rebbe is the Messiah. On one occasion, during the Rebbe's talk at the International Conference of [[Shaliach (Chabad)|Shluchim]] (emissaries), he stated, \"the work of the Shluchim has already finished, and the only task left is to welcome Moshiach\".\n\nIn the early 1990s, Hasidim became more vocal about Schneerson being the Moshiach, even submitting a petition to him asking that he reveal himself as the long-awaited messiah.\n\nOn one occasion in 1991, as the Rebbe was leaving the evening prayers when traditionally someone would start a song and the Rebbe would encourage it on his way out of the synagogue, some Hasidim began singing one of the Rebbe\u2019s favorite lively songs, adding the words of Yechi &ndash; \"Long live our master, our teacher, our Rebbe, King Moshiach.\" \n\nA few months later, a few people did muster the courage to start singing at an intermission in a Shabbos farbrengen a less overt song that implied that the Rebbe was the Messiah. Within a few seconds the Rebbe heard it and immediately became very grave and said: \"Really, I should get up and leave [the room]. Even if some people consider it is not respectful that I need to [be the one to leave], I don\u2019t need to reckon with the views of a small number when [what they are saying] is the opposite of reality. However, first of all, it will unfortunately not help anyway.

It was during this period of illness and inability to communicate that the messianic movement reached its greatest fervor, and became more vocal of their hope that Schneerson would soon be the ''mashiach''. This also troubled many people who felt that it was being imposed upon Schneerson as something he had no control over.<ref name=\"Adin Steinsaltz My Rebbe page 173\"/>\n\nIn the fall of 1992, a special balcony was constructed on the upper level of the [[synagogue]] at [[770 Eastern Parkway]], which overlooked the main sanctuary. This was done in order to allow Schneerson to participate at the daily prayers. It soon became customary for many Hasidim to recite the ''Yechi'' after prayer, to which Schneerson made encouraging motions with his left hand (his right side had been paralyzed by the stroke). On certain occasions; the Rebbe made increasingly big signs of encouragement, such as on Rosh Chodesh Kislev 1992 (5753), when the Rebbe moved his hand back and forth with extreme energy.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nDuring the next two years, the messianists began publicizing their message on television and in newspaper advertisements. Some of Schneerson's collected speeches from the previous two years of his life were collected into pamphlets and published under the title ''Besuras Hageula''. These especially were distributed by the messianic Hasidim in an effort to bolster the case that he would be the Messiah despite his illness, and that the coming of the Messiah is imminent. Such publications was used to bolster the hope that Schneerson would be the ''mashiach''.\n\nBy late 1992, with much talk of Schneerson as the Messiah, a movement to formally crown Schneerson as Messiah gained prominence. Shmuel Butman announced his plan to crown the Rebbe.<ref name=\"but\">[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/72107696.html?dids=72107696:72107696&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=FEB+022C+1993&author=Malcolm+Gladwell&pub=The+Washington+Post&desc=LETTER+FROM+CROWN+HEIGHTS%3B+A+Community's+Day+of+Mystery+and+Faith&pqatl=google \"Letter from Crown Heights\"], [[Malcolm Gladwell]] February 2, 1993 [[The Washington Post]]</ref><ref>''Mashiach Madness reaches frenzy as Lubavitch 'anoint' the Rebbe'', Debra Nussbaum Cohen, Jewish Telegraphic Agency January 28, 1993</ref> The Rebbe, who had been paralyzed and speechless since March the previous year, would join the daily prayers on a special balcony that was built for him to easily be wheeled.

These positions, although not well-known, figure quite prominently and early in authentic Judaic sources.\n\nThe Babylonian Talmud states: \"If he [the Messiah] is among the dead, he is someone like Daniel.\"<ref name=\"Sanhedrin 98b\"/> In fact, the most well-known deceased figure identified as being able to be the Messiah in rabbinic literature is King David. Not that he is the ''mashiach'', but that he perhaps could be. As the Jerusalem Talmud states: \"The Rabbis say, who is King Messiah? If he is from the living, David is his name, if he is from the deceased, David is still his name.\" According to [[Moses Margolies]], a commentator on the Jerusalem Talmud known as the Pnei Moshe, the Talmud rules that: \"If he [the Messiah] is among the living, David will be his name, and if he is from among the dead, he is David himself\".<ref>Brachot 2:4</ref>\n\nOther rabbinic sages object to the notion that Mashiach will be someone who had once lived, died and was then resurrected.

As a result of this, Berger argued that Chabad messianism, which he claimed was prevalent in majority of Chabad and its largest institutions, was beyond the pale of [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodoxy]] and perhaps even heretical. His positions sparked much controversy in the Jewish world during the late 1990s and early 2000s. In his book he documents his efforts to mobilize other rabbis and rabbinical organizations to delegitimize Chabad. He concludes by recording his great frustrations in not being able to achieve this.\n\nMessianism is not advocated in any of Chabad's official literature.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/viewArticle/c36_a1031/News/New_York.html |title=Chabad Gathering: No Jew Left Behind |work=The Jewish Week |author=Jonathan Mark |date=November 14, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309202908/http://www.thejewishweek.com/viewarticle/c36_a1031/news/new_york.html |archivedate=March 9, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |title=Chabad's Global Warming |journal=The Jewish Week |issue=December 2005 |author=Mark, Jonathan}}.

Schneerson]]'s life, some of his supporters thought that he could be revealed as the ''mashiach'' ([[Messiah in Judaism|Messiah]]). There were many [[Chabad]] Hasidim who proclaimed this very passionately. The concept that a righteous Jewish leader may be revealed as the Messiah was believed by many rabbis and scholars regarding their own leaders throughout Jewish history.<ref name=tablet/>\n\nThis idea finds its earliest roots in an early 4th century discussion in the [[Talmud]]: After schools of various prominent rabbis each cite proof-texts that the name of the Messiah is indeed that of their very own teacher, Rabbi Nachman says, \"If he [the Messiah] is among the living, he is someone like me.\" The Talmud then cites the sage Rav: \"If the Messiah is among the living, then he is someone like our holy Rabbi [i.e., Rabbi Judah, the editor of the Mishnah]. [And] if he is from among the dead, he is someone like Daniel.\"<ref name=\"Sanhedrin 98b\">Sanhedrin 98b</ref>\n\n[[Maimonides]] ruled the following as the definitive criteria for identifying the ''mashiach'': If we see a Jewish leader who (a) toils in the study of Torah and is meticulous about the observance of the mitzvot, (b) compels the Jews to follow the ways of the Torah and (c) wages the \"battles of God\"\u2014such a person is the \"presumed mashiach\".<ref name=\"Rambam\">Mishneh Torah, Law of Kings, 9:4, Maimonides</ref> If the person succeeded in all these endeavors, and then rebuilds the Holy Temple in Jerusalem and facilitates the in-gathering of the Jews to the Land of Israel\u2014then we are certain that he is the \"actual mashiach\".<ref name=\"Rambam\"/><ref name=\"Davidson\">{{cite book |last1=Davidson |first1=Herbert A. |title=Moses Maimonides: The Man and His Works |date=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=9780195173215 |page=492 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Qnw8DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA492&dq=Maimonides+criteria+for+identifying+the+mashiach#v=onepage&q=Maimonides%20criteria%20for%20identifying%20the%20mashiach&f=false |language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Chezkat Mashiach and Mashiach Vadai===\nAccording to Maimonides there are two forms of the Messiah.

Hilchot Melachim, Laws of Kings. 4.</ref>\n\n===''Mashiach shebador''===\nIn addition, a number of Talmudic texts, and subsequent writings of ''[[Halakha|halakhic]]'' (Jewish law) authorities, speak of this that in every generation there is always one person who is worthy and has the potential of being the Messiah, and will redeem the Jewish people, should they be deserving.<ref name=\"chabad.org\"/>\n\nThis third form of the messiah is referred to in ''halakhic'' writings as the ''Mashiach shebador'', meaning the messiah of the generation. According to the [[Chatam Sofer]]: \"In every generation there is one righteous man ([[tzaddik]]) who merits to be the Messiah... and when the time comes, God will reveal Himself to him and send him.\"<ref>Responsa Chatam Sofer VI:98</ref> According to [[Chaim Hezekiah Medini]], not only is there such a figure in each generation, but this figure was sometimes explicitly identified as such. \"They assumed who it [Messiah] may be... Rabbi Judah the prince... in his generation they said and knew that it was he who was worthy... and [he goes through a few other generations and then adds] based on this the disciples of the [[Arizal]] wrote that in his time it was him.

Maimonides ruled that all Jews must believe with perfect faith, each day, that the ''mashiach'' will come and the resurrection of the dead will take place. He rules that anyone who does not believe this, denies the entire Torah.<ref>Maimonides Laws of Kings 11:1</ref> [[Yisrael Meir Kagan]] wrote \"our days are the days of Messiah\u2019s coming.

In a vision in which [[Baal Shem Tov]], the founder of Hasidism, encountered the ''mashiach'', the former asked the latter when he will come. The ''mashiach'' answered \"when your teachings [of Hasidism] will be spread forth\". Many Hasidic discourses speak of the need to refine the world and prepare it for its ultimate perfectness when the ''mashiach'' will come.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1600969/jewish/Chassidut.htm|website=Chabad.org |title=What is Chassidut? |first=Tzvi |last=Friedman |access-date=17 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nThroughout Hasidic history, there have also been numerous cases of Rebbes that have been identified by their Hasidim as worthy of being the Messiah. These figures were not thought of having been the actual Messiah, since the criteria that must be fulfilled by the Messiah have been clearly stipulated by Maimonides.

In addition, the Chabad Rebbes often spoke with great passion about the coming of the redemption and the Messiah's imminent arrival.<ref name=\"scribd.com\"/>\n\nIn a speech he gave in 1942, [[Joseph Ber Soloveitchik]] praised the efforts of the Chabad Lubavitch campaign to raise awareness to the coming of the ''mashiach''. Soloveitchik said, \"The Lubavitcher Rebbe speaks and publicizes about the Mashiach and a tumult has erupted, an uproar and an outcry. What is wrong, I ask? That people who are heretics decry him; I understand. That those who violate the [[Shabbat]] decry him; I understand.

Schneerson, soon became the seventh Rebbe. The Rebbe was a passionate believer in the coming of the ''mashiach''. In a letter to Israeli President [[Yitzhak Ben-Zvi]], Schneerson wrote: \"From the time that I was a child attending Cheder, and even before, the vision of the future Redemption began to take form in my imagination -- the Redemption of the Jewish people from their final Exile, a redemption of such magnitude and grandeur through which the purpose of the suffering, the harsh decrees, and annihilation of Exile will be understood.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/177352/lubavitcher-rebbe|title=Who Was the Lubavitcher Rebbe?|work=Tablet Magazine|accessdate=23 December 2014}}</ref> Schneerson also encouraged people to focus on Messiah very much. Beginning with his very first farbrengen as Rebbe, he spoke of this generation's mission to complete the ''[[Dira Betachtonim]]'', and urged everyone to do all within their power to help the world reach its ultimate state of perfection, when Godliness and goodness will be naturally apparent and prevalent, with the final redemption.<ref name=\"Adin Steinsaltz My Rebbe page 173\">Adin Steinsaltz, ''My Rebbe,'' page 173.</ref>\n\nSchneerson would finish almost every public talk of his with a prayer for the imminent arrival of the Messiah. As early as the 1970s, he sought to raise awareness of the Messianic age by encouraging people to learn and become knowledgeable in the laws of the [[Holy Temple]], laws that will only apply when the Messiah actually comes. In this connection, he quoted from earlier rabbinic opinion that learning about the redemption would raise awareness of and could actually bring the Messiah sooner.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Schneerson would frequently quote the many sages who stated that this generation was the last generation of the exile and would be the first generation of redemption and would quote the Chafetz Chaim and others, who stated that actively asking for the Messiah's coming is crucial.<ref>Adin Steinsaltz, My Rebbe, page 178</ref>\n\n===Criticism of Schneerson's passion for the arrival of the Messiah===\nAs Schneerson's passion about the need for Messiah became more well-known, criticism also built up. In 1980, a group of children from a Chabad summer camp composed a song with the words \"am yisrael [nation of Israel] have no fear, Moshiach will be here this year, we want Moshiach now, we don\u2019t want to wait.\" Schneerson seems to have received great satisfaction from the children's initiative, and greatly encouraged their song.<ref name=\"Telushkin431\">Telushkin, ''Rebbe:'' p. 431</ref>\n\nIn light of some criticism about the insistent tone of these words, on one occasion he explained \"This has always been the hope and yearning of the Jewish people \u2013 that the Messiah should come now, immediately. Therefore it is inappropriate for someone to say that he does not want, or that he does not agree, or that he is not comfortable that people are imploring 'we want moshiach now.' Each Jew clearly prays and pleads three times a day in the amida, while standing before the Al-mighty (at that time a person is certainly speaking the truth, and saying what he means) ''et tzemach David avdecha me\u2019hera tatzmiach'' [that we merit the final redemption and coming of the Messiah speedily], and then continues ''ki lishuatcha kivinu kol hayom'', that he hopes for this the entire day!\"<ref>Likutei Sichot vol. 20 pp. 458-459</ref>\n\nSchneerson urged and talked about purifying all parts of the world through Torah and [[Mitzvah]]s (commandments) in order to bring Mashiach. Many times he would weep publicly about the deep slumber and exile we are in, and how urgent it is that God redeem us, both for our sake as well as even for His own.<ref>Adin Steinsaltz My Rebbe page 174</ref>\n\nNevertheless, criticism of his passion about the coming of the Messiah and, his urging people to do all they could to bring about the redemption by adding in the observance of Torah and Mitzvahs, was something that was known to him. On one occasion he even remarked \"I have merited that the complaint people have against me is that I am passionate about the Mashiach.\"<ref name=\"Telushkin431\"/>\n\n===Talk of Schneerson as the Messiah===\n[[File:Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson2 crop.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Menachem M. Schneerson]] (1902-1994)]]\nMany Hasidim of the seventh Rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneerson felt that he is the ''mashiach'' of the generation, even though he never said so himself.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Chabad's Messianism and Israeli Radicals. Azure no. 41.</ref>\n\nAccording to research by [[Rachel Elior]], the belief that the Rebbe would be the Messiah built up during the 1980s. She asserts that messianism can be traced back even to the previous Lubavitcher Rebbe, but cites evidence that the 1980s saw an upsurge. Nevertheless, this hope was initially kept to a hush.<ref>\"The Lubavitch Messianic Resurgence: The Historical and Mystical Background 1939\u20131996\", Rachel Elior in ''Toward the Millennium: Messianic Expectations from the Bible to Waco'' ed. Peter Sch\u00e4fer and Mark Cohen, 383\u2013408. (Leiden: Brill, 1998)</ref>\n\n[[Shalom Dov Wolpo]] brought up the issue in 1984 by publishing a booklet declaring Schneerson to be the Messiah. Schneerson responded by banning the publication and forbidding Wolpo from involvement with any Messiah related topics.<ref>''The Revelation of Melech HaMashiach (King Messiah), \"Yechi HaMelech\"'', Sholom Ber Wolpo, \"The Committee for Fulfilling the Rebbe's Directives\"</ref> Wolpo would later argue that despite the Rebbe's strong opposition, \"everyone must still consider and proclaim the Rebbe as the Messiah\" arguing that \"acceptance of the Messiah must be done by the people not by the King\".<ref>Telushkin, ''Rebbe:'' p. 429</ref>\n\nAs the years went on, and recognition of Schneerson as being so toweringly unique, a Rebbe of truly unprecedented and universally recognized stature, spread ever further, this messianic speculation spread to greater numbers and higher volume than in previous generations. The Hasidim became vocal of their hope that Schneerson would be the one to be the Messiah.<ref name=\"scribd.com\"/>\n\nChaim Bergstein was quoted{{where|date=January 2015}} as saying \"I'm not saying he is or isn't Mashiach, but there is no one as learned ... in this generation.\" ''Time'' magazine journalist [[Lisa Beyer]] reported that [[Adin Even-Yisrael]] said he wished that Schneerson should be revealed as the Messiah.\"<ref>\"[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,975127,00.html Expecting the Messiah] \u2014 An Ultra-Orthodox sect says the Redeemer is due to arrive any day now \u2014 and he might be an American\" ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, Lisa Beyer, March 23, 1992] (paywalled).</ref> Even Rabbi [[Yehuda Krinsky]] told ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1988: \"Our sages tell us that the Messiah is a man of flesh and blood who lives among us...

That year, Avraham Parizh printed letters that spoke of Schneerson as the Messiah and started handing them out in Israel. When Schneerson learned of this, he immediately dispatch a telegram to Parizh in Israel saying that he was \"shocked by the letter [you wrote and disseminated]\" and asked that Parizh \"immediately cease distributing it.\" Schneerson instructed Parizh to \"gather and send to all extant copies of the letter, every last one, and please confirm immediately that you have fulfilled this instruction.\"<ref>Echad Hoyo Avrohom Page 160</ref>\n\nIn 1984, Sholom Dov Wolpo published a booklet identifying Schneerson as the Messiah. Schneerson publicly denounced these actions several times. During one of these talks he said that those involved [in the publication] were starting a new war against Chabad, and that he should never have to speak about it again. On Shabbat Bereshit, when Wolpo began singing a song that had long been popular in Lubavitch, which referred to Schneerson as the Messiah, he abruptly stopped the singing and ordered that it never be sung again.<ref>''Sefer Hisva'aduyos'' 5745, Vol. 1, p. 465</ref>\n\nIn 1991, Aharon Dov Halprin, the editor of Israeli magazine ''Kfar Chabad'', prepared an article that explained why the Rebbe was worthy of being considered Messiah. When the Rebbe got word of this he responded sharply, \"If you, God forbid, [plan to] do anything even remotely similar, it is preferable that you shut down the periodical completely\".{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nOn a number of occasions Schneerson said that rabbis should issue a ''[[Posek|psak din]]'' (ruling) that Moshiach must come. In 1988,[[Yitzchak Hendel]] issued a ruling stating, not that the Messiah must come, but that the Rebbe was to be the Messiah. When the Rebbe saw the ruling, he responded to Hendel and wrote ''me\u2019heichan dantuni?'' (Talmudic term connoting: On what basis have you ruled against me?) Is this the standard of all your rabbinic rulings!?\"<ref>Cheshbono shel Olom page 56.</ref>\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, Schneerson's talks became increasingly focused on the topic of Moshiach, that Moshiach was about to come, and what was needed to accomplish this. These talks would often take on a sense of urgency. This, coupled with Schneerson's frequent statement that ours is the \"Last Generation of ''[[Jewish diaspora|galut]]'' (exile) and it is the first generation of ''[[geulah]]'', the redemption\" is one of the arguments put forward{{by whom|date=December 2014}} that the Rebbe is the Messiah. On one occasion, during the Rebbe's talk at the International Conference of [[Shaliach (Chabad)|Shluchim]] (emissaries), he stated, \"the work of the Shluchim has already finished, and the only task left is to welcome Moshiach\".\n\nIn the early 1990s, Hasidim became more vocal about Schneerson being the Moshiach, even submitting a petition to him asking that he reveal himself as the long-awaited messiah.\n\nOn one occasion in 1991, as the Rebbe was leaving the evening prayers when traditionally someone would start a song and the Rebbe would encourage it on his way out of the synagogue, some Hasidim began singing one of the Rebbe\u2019s favorite lively songs, adding the words of Yechi &ndash; \"Long live our master, our teacher, our Rebbe, King Moshiach.\" \n\nA few months later, a few people did muster the courage to start singing at an intermission in a Shabbos farbrengen a less overt song that implied that the Rebbe was the Messiah. Within a few seconds the Rebbe heard it and immediately became very grave and said: \"Really, I should get up and leave [the room]. Even if some people consider it is not respectful that I need to [be the one to leave], I don\u2019t need to reckon with the views of a small number when [what they are saying] is the opposite of reality. However, first of all, it will unfortunately not help anyway. Secondly, it will disrupt the ''shevet achim gam yachad'' (brethren to dwell together in unity), for if I were to leave, others will leave, too.\"<ref>Sichos Kodesh, Parshas Noach 5752</ref>\n\nIn 1992, a journalist from Israel said to the Rebbe, \"We appreciate you very much, we want to see you in Israel; you said soon you will be in Israel, so when will you come?\" The Rebbe responded: \"I also want to be in Israel.\" The journalist insisted, \"So when, when will you come?\" The Rebbe responded, \"That depends on the Moshiach, not on me.\" The journalist persisted, \"You are the Moshiach!\" to which the Rebbe responded, \"I am not.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://azure.org.il/include/print.php?id=549|title=Chabad's Messianism and Israeli Radicals|publisher=|accessdate=23 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n===During Schneerson's illness===\nOn March 2, 1992, while praying at the [[Ohel (Chabad-Lubavitch)|Ohel]], the site where his father-in-law is buried, Schneerson suffered a massive stroke.<ref name=\"Toward\"/> That very evening, while he was being treated for his stroke and Chabad Hasidim around the world gathered for prayer, some of the messianists broke out in song and dance. It was during this period of illness and inability to communicate that the messianic movement reached its greatest fervor, and became more vocal of their hope that Schneerson would soon be the ''mashiach''. This also troubled many people who felt that it was being imposed upon Schneerson as something he had no control over.<ref name=\"Adin Steinsaltz My Rebbe page 173\"/>\n\nIn the fall of 1992, a special balcony was constructed on the upper level of the [[synagogue]] at [[770 Eastern Parkway]], which overlooked the main sanctuary. This was done in order to allow Schneerson to participate at the daily prayers. It soon became customary for many Hasidim to recite the ''Yechi'' after prayer, to which Schneerson made encouraging motions with his left hand (his right side had been paralyzed by the stroke). On certain occasions; the Rebbe made increasingly big signs of encouragement, such as on Rosh Chodesh Kislev 1992 (5753), when the Rebbe moved his hand back and forth with extreme energy.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nDuring the next two years, the messianists began publicizing their message on television and in newspaper advertisements. Some of Schneerson's collected speeches from the previous two years of his life were collected into pamphlets and published under the title ''Besuras Hageula''. These especially were distributed by the messianic Hasidim in an effort to bolster the case that he would be the Messiah despite his illness, and that the coming of the Messiah is imminent. Such publications was used to bolster the hope that Schneerson would be the ''mashiach''.\n\nBy late 1992, with much talk of Schneerson as the Messiah, a movement to formally crown Schneerson as Messiah gained prominence. Shmuel Butman announced his plan to crown the Rebbe.<ref name=\"but\">[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/72107696.html?dids=72107696:72107696&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=FEB+022C+1993&author=Malcolm+Gladwell&pub=The+Washington+Post&desc=LETTER+FROM+CROWN+HEIGHTS%3B+A+Community's+Day+of+Mystery+and+Faith&pqatl=google \"Letter from Crown Heights\"], [[Malcolm Gladwell]] February 2, 1993 [[The Washington Post]]</ref><ref>''Mashiach Madness reaches frenzy as Lubavitch 'anoint' the Rebbe'', Debra Nussbaum Cohen, Jewish Telegraphic Agency January 28, 1993</ref> The Rebbe, who had been paralyzed and speechless since March the previous year, would join the daily prayers on a special balcony that was built for him to easily be wheeled. Butman planned to crown the Rebbe on January 30, 1993 after the evening prayers. However, when the Rebbe got word of the planned event, he communicated to his secretaries Leibel Groner and Yudel Krinsky that he would only attend for the usual evening service. Both Groner and Krinsky, then followed by Butman, announced that the event was actually not a coronation and should not be intended as such.<ref>\"Rabbi's appearance fails to reveal messiah\", ''[[Deseret News]]'', February 1, 1993</ref>\n\n===Schneerson's death===\nOn 3 Tammuz 1994, more than two years after he suffered a stroke that took away his ability to speak, the Rebbe died. His death left the Chabad community, much of the Jewish world, and even beyond, in mourning.<ref name=\"ded\">''Death of Lubavitcher Leader, Rabbi Schneerson, Stuns Followers '', Laurie Goodstein, Washington Post, June 13, 1994</ref>\nFrom all over the world, people streamed to New York to participate in the funeral. The New York Times placed six articles about the Rebbe in the paper that week. Television devoted many hours of broadcast time to Schneerson\u2019s death.\n''[[The New York Times]]'' reported from the funeral that the death had left many Jews stunned:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/13/nyregion/rabbi-schneerson-led-a-small-hasidic-sect-to-world-prominence.html?src=pm&pagewanted=2|title=Rabbi Schneerson Led A Small Hasidic Sect To World Prominence|date=13 June 1994|publisher=|accessdate=23 December 2014}}</ref>\n{{cquote|Not all of Rabbi Schneerson's followers were Hasidim. Conservative and Reform Jews were among his greatest supporters.}}\n\nHowever, his view was not shared by all. Some of the messianists were so caught up with their hope, that they interpreted each new erosion in the Rebbe's health, and ultimately his very death, as stages in the messianic process. They cited various midrashic statements to fuel their ecstasy as to the imminent revelation of the Messiah, and some of them drank and toasted l\u2019chaim and danced before and during the funeral - an act that shocked many admirers of Schneerson across the Jewish world. And in the days after Schneerson's death, many journalists and pundits wrote how they expected the end of the movement.<ref>\"What Really Happens When Prophecy Fails: The Case of Lubavitch.\" Dein, Simon. ''Sociology of Religion'', 9/22/2001.</ref>\n\nFor many Chabad followers, the death of the Rebbe was extremely painful. He was laid to rest next to his father-in-law, at the [[Ohel (Chabad-Lubavitch)|Ohel]], at the Montefiore cemetery in Queens. In Jewish tradition, significant dates are frequently referred to by their Hebrew characters. Chabad (like other Jewish movements) dating back to their first Rebbe, [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]], dates of all their Rebbes' deaths by Hebrew dates. Thus, in the case of Schneerson, the anniversary of his death became known as [[Gimmel Tammuz]] (the third of Tammuz).\n\nIn the week after the Rebbe's death, the ''Wisconsin Chronicle'' editorialized and wrote how many Jews now find it difficult to believe that Messiah will ever come:\n{{cquote|Most modern Jews can't help but shrug at some claims that Schneerson is, or was, the most likely candidate in our time to be the Messiah, the King David-descended redeemer who according to tradition will inaugurate the final age of world peace and plenty. But if a Messiah does come, that personality likely will have much in common with Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson.}}\n\n===The belief that Schneerson would still be the Messiah after his death===\n{{Original research|discuss=Talk:Chabad Messianism#Resurrection of Mashiach in Judaic tradition|date=March 2015}}\nFor many hopeful, often vocal, followers, Schneerson's death did not rule out the hope that he could still be the Mashiach.\n\nThere are Talmudic and ''halakhic'' sources that speak of the possibility that a righteous Jewish leader could be resurrected to become the ''mashiach''. These positions, although not well-known, figure quite prominently and early in authentic Judaic sources.\n\nThe Babylonian Talmud states: \"If he [the Messiah] is among the dead, he is someone like Daniel.\"<ref name=\"Sanhedrin 98b\"/> In fact, the most well-known deceased figure identified as being able to be the Messiah in rabbinic literature is King David. Not that he is the ''mashiach'', but that he perhaps could be. As the Jerusalem Talmud states: \"The Rabbis say, who is King Messiah? If he is from the living, David is his name, if he is from the deceased, David is still his name.\" According to [[Moses Margolies]], a commentator on the Jerusalem Talmud known as the Pnei Moshe, the Talmud rules that: \"If he [the Messiah] is among the living, David will be his name, and if he is from among the dead, he is David himself\".<ref>Brachot 2:4</ref>\n\nOther rabbinic sages object to the notion that Mashiach will be someone who had once lived, died and was then resurrected. As Maimonides writes: \"Even if one is worthy of being Mashiach, if he is killed it is certain that he is not Mashiach.\"<ref name=\"berger_scandal\">{{cite book|last=Berger|first=David|title=The Rebbe, the Messiah, and the Scandal of Orthodox Indifference|publisher=Littman Library of Jewish Civilization|date=April 1, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"jaffe\">{{cite web|last=Jaffe|first=Melech|title=A Brief History of Lubavitch Messianism|url=http://www.moshiachlisten.com/history.html}}</ref>\n\n==Expressions==\n\n===Messianists===\n[[File:Old Jerusalem Jewish Quarter Beit El Road.JPG|thumb|The Messianist Flag in Jerusalem]]\nSubsequent to Schneerson's death, vocal messianists have continued to proclaim that Schneerson is still alive. Some of them argue that just as the Talmud states that \"Jacob did not die\" a teaching that carries great nuanuced significance in [[Kabbalah|kabbalistic]] thought, so too \"Schneerson did not die\".<ref>[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/7972/jewish/Epistle-27.htm ''Igeret Hakodesh'' #27b]</ref><ref>Dvar Malchut, Parashat Shoftim, 5751; Sefer Hisvaadiyus 1991 vol. 4 Page 204</ref><ref name=\"chabad\">[http://www.chabad.org/parshah/article.asp?AID=2711 Example of Chabad exegesis on the death of a great man]</ref>\n\nAmong religious Jews, reference to one who has died is followed by expressions such as ''alav hashalom'' or ''zechuto yagen alenu''. Messianists do not use such terms when writing of Schneerson.<ref>Telushkin, Rebbe: p. 429</ref> Some messianists have even continued to use terms that indicate that Schneerson is still alive such as ''shlita''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Berger|first=David|title=The Rebbe, the Messiah, and the Scandal of Orthodox Indifference|publisher=Littman Library of Jewish Civilization of Portland|year=2001|page=42}}</ref>\n\nGenerally speaking, the majority of this group consists of very vocal Israeli youth, particularly those educated in the city of Safed. There are also members of the messianic camp within the Crown Heights community and elsewhere who share these views. These individuals can usually be identified by the small yellow pin, known as the Moshiach flag worn on their lapel (or hat), and the Hebrew words of \"Yechi\" emblazoned on their kippot.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Since Schneerson's death, ''Beis Moshiach magazine'' has been a major organ for views within this camp of the messianist.

In a series or articles that were later published in his book ''[[The Rebbe, the Messiah, and the Scandal of Orthodox Indifference]]'', Berger argued that there is no source in Jewish theology for the concept that a messiah will come, begin his mission, only to die, and then be resurrected to complete his mission. As a result of this, Berger argued that Chabad messianism, which he claimed was prevalent in majority of Chabad and its largest institutions, was beyond the pale of [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodoxy]] and perhaps even heretical. His positions sparked much controversy in the Jewish world during the late 1990s and early 2000s. In his book he documents his efforts to mobilize other rabbis and rabbinical organizations to delegitimize Chabad. He concludes by recording his great frustrations in not being able to achieve this.\n\nMessianism is not advocated in any of Chabad's official literature.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/viewArticle/c36_a1031/News/New_York.html |title=Chabad Gathering: No Jew Left Behind |work=The Jewish Week |author=Jonathan Mark |date=November 14, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309202908/http://www.thejewishweek.com/viewarticle/c36_a1031/news/new_york.html |archivedate=March 9, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |title=Chabad's Global Warming |journal=The Jewish Week |issue=December 2005 |author=Mark, Jonathan}}.

It translates as \"Long Live our Master, our Teacher, and our Rabbi, King Messiah, for ever.\" The phrase can be seen printed in various settings, notably on pamphlets, posters and small cards and keyrings.
