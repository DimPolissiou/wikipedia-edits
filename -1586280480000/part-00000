[[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Ontario]], situated along the shore of [[Attawapiskat Lake]] in the [[Kenora District, Ontario|District of Kenora]].\n\nThe First Nation is a signatory to [[Treaty 9]] (originally as part of the [[Eabametoong First Nation|Fort Hope Band]]) and has reserved for itself the {{convert|831.50|ha|acre}} '''Neskantaga [[Indian Reserve]]''', containing the main community of '''Lansdowne House Indian Settlement''' on [[Attawapiskat Lake]]. Associated with the Neskantaga First Nation is the '''Summer Beaver Indian Settlement''', which is shared with [[Nibinamik First Nation]]. The Lansdowne House is linked to the rest of Ontario by the [[Lansdowne House Airport]], and by [[winter road]]s and [[ice road]]s to points south, via the [[Northern Ontario Resource Trail]]. As of November 2011, there is a total registered population of 414 people, of whom 304 people live on their own reserve.\n\nNorthern Light Mission Trips have been conducted for the children of the community by members of the Tintern Church of Christ in [[Beamsville, Ontario]].\n\n==Governance==\nThe First Nation elects its officials under the Custom Electoral System. The most recent officials were Peter Moonias as Chief, and Bill Mequanawap, Christopher Moonias, Kelvin Moonias and William Moonias as Councillors; their two-year term ended on 03/31/2013.\n\nThe First Nation's council is a member of the [[Matawa First Nations]], a local Chiefs Council, and of [[Nishnawbe Aski Nation]], a Tribal Political Organisation representing most of the First Nations in northern Ontario.\n\n==Ring of Fire==\n{{main|Northern Ontario Ring of Fire}}\n\nOn May 9, 2012 Ontario Minister [[Rick Bartolucci]] released the White Paper regarding the Northern Ontario Ring of Fire, including the announcement of decisions made regarding Cliffs and the province that would negatively impact [[Treaty 9]] land. According to the Neskantaga First Nation, the agreements with Cliffs about Treaty 9 lands, was a \"blatant and illegal attempt by Ontario to expand its own influence and jurisdiction in Treaty No. 9.<ref name=\"neskantaga\">{{cite web |work=Neskantaga First Nation |title=A New Deal for First Nations and the North |archive-url=https://archive.is/20150821173836/http://neskantaga.com/#selection-297.0-313.42 |url=http://neskantaga.com/#selection-297.0-313.42 |date=May 9, 2012 |access-date=October 23, 2018 |archive-date=2012}}</ref>\n\n==Access to potable water==\n\nNeskantaga First Nation community has been under a \"boil water advisory\" since 1995, when its then-newly installed 1993 water treatment plant broke down. It gained national attention when Canadian news outlets began to cover the story from 2004 to 2016 about the unsafe water supply. In 2006, the 2005 government plan to modernize water supplies was cancelled following a change of government.<ref>https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/unresolved-water-advisories-in-aboriginal-communities-creating-a-health-emergency/article27627801/</ref>\n\n==Services==\n;Schools\n*Neskantaga Education Centre;\n*Neskantaga Elementary School;\t\n*[[Keewayintook Internet High School]] (KiHS) - Offers a variety of grade 9 to 12 courses including PLAR and CO-OP.\n\n;Health Care\n*[[Keewaytinook Okimakanak]] Telemedicine (KOTM) - Neskantaga Site;\n*Neskantaga Health & Social Services.\n;Other\n*Neskantaga Band Office;\t\n*Neskantaga Northern Store.\t\n\nNeskantaga is [[police]]d by the [[Nishnawbe-Aski Police Service]], an Aboriginal-based service.

{"title_page": "Luminous gemstones", "text_new": "{{short description|Worldwide motif in mythology and history}}\n{{Use Harvard referencing|date=January 2019}}\nFolktales about '''luminous gemstones''' are an almost worldwide [[Motif (folkloristics)|motif]] in mythology and history among Asian, European, African, and American cultures. Some stories about light-emitting gems may have been based on [[luminescent]] and [[phosphorescent]] minerals such as diamonds.\n\n==Mineralogical luminosity ==\n[[File:Thermolumine.png|thumb|[[Thermoluminescence]] from heating [[chlorophane]] specimens on a hotplate.]]\n[[File:Tribo.ogv|thumb|[[Triboluminescence]] from rubbing together two [[quartz]] crystals.]]\nFirst, it will be useful to introduce some [[mineralogical]] terminology for [[gemstones]] that can glow when exposed to light, friction, or heat. Note that the following discussion will omit modern techniques such as [[X-rays]] and [[ultraviolet light]] that are too recent to have influenced folklore about luminous gems. [[Luminescence]] is [[spontaneous emission]] of [[light]] by a substance not resulting from heat, as distinguished from [[incandescence]], which is light emitted by a substance as a result of heating. Luminescence is caused by the absorption of energy that is released in small amounts. When the energy comes from light or other [[electromagnetic radiation]], it is referred to as [[photoluminescence]]; which is divisible between [[fluorescence]] when the glow ceases immediately with the excitation and [[phosphorescence]] when the glow continues beyond the period of excitation. Two types of luminescent phenomena are relevant to [[crystalline]] materials. [[Triboluminescence]] generates light through the breaking of [[chemical bond]]s in a material when it is rubbed, pulled apart, scratched, or crushed. [[Thermoluminescence]] re-emits previously absorbed electromagnetic radiation upon being heated (e.g., [[thermoluminescence dating]]).\n\nThe American geologist [[Sydney Hobart Ball]], who wrote an article on \"Luminous Gems, Mythical and Real\", outlined the history of discoveries about luminescent and phosphorescent minerals. Most [[diamonds]] are triboluminescent if rubbed with a cloth, and a few are photoluminescent after exposure to direct sunlight. Both diamonds and white [[Topaz]] may phosphoresce if heated below [[red heat]]. The phosphorescent quality of diamonds when heated by sunlight is usually believed to have been first revealed by [[Albertus Magnus]] (c. 1193-1280) and it was apparently rediscovered by [[Robert Boyle]] in 1663, who also found that some diamonds will luminesce under pressure. According to [[Prafulla Chandra Ray]], the Indian king [[Bhoja]] (r. 1010\u20131055) knew that diamonds can phosphoresce (Ball 1938: 496). \n\nThe luminescent [[Bologna Stone]] (impure [[barite]]), which was discovered by Vincenzo Cascariolo in 1602, was sometimes called \"{{linktext|lapis |lunaris}}\" (\"lunar stone\"), because, like the moon, it gave out in the darkness the light is received from the sun (Kunz 1913: 168). In 1735, the French chemist [[Charles Fran\u00e7ois de Cisternay du Fay]] determined that [[lapis lazuli]], [[emerald]], and [[aquamarine (gemstone)|aquamarine]] were luminescent. [[Josiah Wedgwood]], in 1792, found phosphoresce from rubbing together two pieces of quartz or of [[agate]], and wrote that the [[ruby]] gives \"a beautiful red light of short continuance.\" [[Edmond Becquerel]] reported in 1861 that ruby fluoresces better than [[sapphire]], red [[feldspar]] fluoresces, and crushed [[orthoclase]] will flame. In 1833, [[David Brewster]] discovered the fluorescence of the mineral [[fluorite]] or fluorspar. However, the English naturalist [[Philip Skippon (1641\u20131691)|Philip Skippon]] (1641\u20131691) stated that one Monsieur Lort, of [[Montpellier]], France, a \"counterfeiter\" of \"amethysts, topazes, emeralds, and sapphires\" found that on heating \"''[[wikt:fluor#Latin|fluor]] [[wikt:smaragdi#Latin|smaragdi]]''\" (Latin for \"flowing emerald/beryl/jasper\") in a pan of coals and afterward \"putting it in a dark place (it) shines very much: At the same time several other stones were tried but did not shine.\" (1732 6: 718).\n\nSome fluorite, particularly the variety [[chlorophane]] (aka pyroemerald and cobra stone), will become luminescent simply from the heat of one's hand. Chlorophane is unusual for combining the properties of thermoluminescence, triboluminescence, phosphorescence, and fluorescence; it will emit [[visible spectrum]] light when rubbed, or exposed to light or heat, and can continue emitting for a long period of time. Among the gravels of the [[Irtysh River]], near [[Krasnoyarsk]], Russia, the German mineralogist [[Gustav Rose]] recorded seeing chlorophane pebbles that shone with brilliancy all night long, merely from exposure to the sun's heat. For luminous gem myths, Ball concludes that while it is \"not impossible that the inventors of certain of the [luminous gem] tales may have been acquainted with the luminosity of gems, in my opinion, many of the tales must be of another origin\" (1938: 497).\n\nScholars have proposed many identifications for myths about luminous gemstones described for over two thousand years. Most frequently rubies or [[carbuncle (gemstone)|carbuncles]] (often red [[garnet]]s), which classical and medieval mineralogists did not differentiate, and less commonly other gems, including diamonds, emeralds, jade, and pearls (Ball 1938: 497). \n\nThe American sinologist [[Edward H. Schafer]] proposes that the phosphorescent \"emeralds\" of classical antiquity, such as the brilliantly shining green eyes of the marble lion on the tomb of King [[Hermias of Atarneus]] (d. 341 BCE) on Cyprus, were [[fluorite]], even though the Hellenistic alchemists had methods, \"seemingly magical, of making night-shining gems by the application of phosphorescent paints tostones\", the most famous being their \"emeralds\" and \"carbuncles.\" (1963: 238).\n\nThe names of some luminescent gemstones etymologically derive from \"glow\" or \"fire\" words (e.g., ''pyroemerald'' for \"chlorophane\" above). \nThe ''[[OED]]'' defines ''[[pyrope]]'' (from Greek \u03a0\u03c5\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03cc\u03c2, lit. \"fire-eyed\")\" as: \"In early use applied vaguely to a red or fiery gem, like ruby or carbuncle; (mineralogy) the Bohemian garnet or fire-garnet\"; and ''[[Carbuncle (gemstone)|carbuncle]]'' or ''carbuncle-stone'' (from Latin \"carbuncles,\" \"small glowing ember\") as: \"A name variously applied to precious stones of red or fiery color; the carbuncles of the ancients (of which Pliny describes twelve varieties) were probably sapphires, spinels or rubies, and garnets; in the Middle Ages and later, besides being a name for the ruby, the term was esp. applied to a mythical gem said to emit light in the dark.\" (Ball 1938: 498).\n<gallery>\nFile:Beryl-209736.jpg|[[Aquamarine (gemstone)|Aquamarine]]\nFile:Barite-d05-36a.jpg|[[Barite]]\nFile:Cobra-stone (Nagamani).jpg|[[Chlorophane]]\nFile:DiamanteEZ.jpg|[[Diamond]]\nFile: B\u00e9ryl var. \u00e9meraude Sur gangue (Muzo Mine Boyaca - Colombie) 2.jpg|[[Emerald]] \nFile: Museo de La Plata - Feldespato.jpg|[[Feldspar]]\nFile:Fluorite-132158.jpg|[[Fluorite]]\nFile: Forsterite orange - Ochtendung, Eifel, Germany.jpg|[[Fosterite]]\nFile:Grossular-ww51a.jpg|[[Garnet]]\nFile:Lapis-lazuli hg.jpg|[[Lapis lazuli]]\nFile:Olivine-23909.jpg|[[Olivine]]\nFile:Forsterite-Olivine-tmu14a.jpg|[[Peridot]]\nFile: Garnet Group-Pyrope Iron aluminum silicate Barton Mines, Gore Mountain, Warren County, New York 2861.jpg|[[Pyrope]] \nFile: Quartz oisan.jpg|[[Quartz]]\nFile:Corundum-denv08-11b.jpg|[[Ruby]]\nFile:Corundum-190227.jpg|[[Sapphire]]\nFile:Sp3.jpg|[[Spinel]]\nFile:Topaze Blanche 3 (Br\u00e9sil).jpg|[[Topaz]]\nFile:Tourmaline-20576.jpg|[[Tourmaline]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Mythological luminosity==\nLuminous gems are common theme in [[comparative mythology]]. Ball [[Cross-cultural studies|cross-culturally]] analyzed stories about luminous stones and pearls and found about one hundred variants in ancient, medieval, and modern sources. The wide-ranging locations of the tales comprise all Asia (except Siberia), all Europe (except Norway and Russia), Borneo, New Guinea, the United States, Canada, certain South American countries and Abyssinia, French Congo, and Angola in Africa. The later African and American myths were likely introduced by Europeans. Ball divides legends about luminous gems into three principal themes: [[List of light sources|light source]]s, gem mining, and animals (Ball 1938: 497-498).\n\n===Light source legends===\nThe first theme is using legendary luminous gems to illuminate buildings, for [[navigation light]]s on ships, or sometimes as guiding lights for lost persons (Ball 1938: 498-500).\n\nIn India, the earliest country in which fine gemstones were known, belief in luminous gems dates back some twenty-five centuries. The c. 700 BCE-300 CE ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'' states that [[Vishnu]], in his avatar as the many-headed snake [[Shesha]] under the name [[wikt:Ananta|Ananta]] (\"Endless\"), \"has a thousand heads adorned with the mystical Swastika and in each head a jewel to give light\" (Ball 1938: 498). The c. 400 BCE-300 CE Hindu classic ''[[Mahabharata]]'' tells the story of the five [[Pandava]] brothers and the raja [[Babruvahana]]'s palace with its precious stones that \"shone like lamps so that there was no need for any other light in the assembly.\" In the c. 100 CE ''[[Buddhacarita]]'', the city of [[Kapila]] is said to have gems so bright \"that darkness like poverty could find no place.\" (Ball 1938: 499).\n\nIn [[Classical antiquity]], the Greek historian [[Herodotus]] (c. 484-425 BCE) was the first European to describe luminous gems. The temple of [[Heracles]] at [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] had two great columns, one of gold, the other of ''smaragdos'' ({{linktext| \u03c3\u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2}}, \"green gems including emerald\") that \"shone brightly at night\" (Harvey 1957: 33, suggesting the phosphorescent \"false emerald\" type of [[fluorspar]]). Ball says that the \"wily priests doubtless enclosed a lamp in hollow green glass, to mislead the credulous\". The [[Pseudo-Plutarch]] \"On Rivers\", probably written by the Greek grammarian [[Parthenius of Nicaea]] (d. 14 CE), states that in the [[Sakarya River]] the ''Aster'' ({{linktext|\u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1}}, \"star\") gem is found, \"which flames in the dark\", and thus called ''Ballen'' (the \"King\") in the [[Phrygian language]] (King 1867: 9). The Roman author [[Pliny the Elder]] (23\u201379 CE) described the ''chrysolampis'' as an eastern gem, \"pale by day but of a fiery luster by night\" (Ball 1938: 499). The Syrian rhetorician [[Lucian]] (c. 125-180 CE) describes a statue of the Syrian goddess [[Atargatis]] in [[Hierapolis Bambyce]] (present-day [[Manbij]]) with a gem on her head called Greek ''[[wikt:lychnus|lychnis]]'' ({{linktext|\u03bb\u03cd\u03c7\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2}}, \"lamp; light\") (Schafer 1963: 237). \"From this stone flashes a great light in the night-time, so that the whole temple gleams brightly as by the light of myriads of candles, but in the daytime the brightness grows faint; the gem has the likeness of a bright fire.\" (tr. Strong and Garstang 1913: 72). According to Pliny, the stone is called ''lychnis'' because its luster is heightened by the light of a lamp, when its tints are particularly pleasing (Laufer 1915: 58).\n\nAlthough early Chinese classics from the [[Eastern Zhou dynasty]] (770\u2013256 BCE) refer to luminous gems (e.g., \"the Marquis of Sui's pearl\" discussed below under grateful animals), [[Sima Qian]]'s c. 94 BCE [[Han dynasty]] ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' has two early references to using them as a source of light. Most [[Chinese language|Chinese]] names for shining pearls/gems are [[Compound (linguistics)|compounds]] of ''zh\u016b'' ([[wikt:\u73e0|\u73e0]], \"pearl; gem; bead; orb\"), such as ''y\u00e8m\u00edngzh\u016b'' (\u591c\u660e\u73e0, \"night luminous pearl\"), ''m\u00edngyu\u00e8zh\u016b'' (\u660e\u6708\u73e0, \"luminous moon pearl\"), and ''y\u00e8gu\u0101ngzh\u016b'' (\u591c\u5149\u73e0, \"night shining pearl\"). The \"House of [[Duke Tai of Tian Qi|Tian Jingzhong]]\" history records that in 379 BCE, [[King Wei of Qi]] boasted to [[King Hui of Wei]], \"Even a state as small as mine still has ten pearls one inch in diameter that cast radiance over twelve carriages in front and behind them.\" (tr. Sawyer 2018: n.p.). In the biography of the Han court minister Zou Yang (\u9112\u967d, fl. 150 BCE), he figuratively uses the terms ''mingyue zhi zhu'' (\u660e\u6708\u4e4b\u73e0, \"luminous moon pearl\") and ''yeguang zhi bi'' (\u591c\u5149\u4e4b\u58c1, \"night shining [[Bi (jade)|jade-disk]]\") to illustrate how talented people are lost for lack of recommendations, \"If I were to throw a luminous moon pearl or a night shining jade-disk on a dark road in front of someone, who would not grasp their sword and look startled?\" The German sinologist [[August Conrady]] suggested that the Chinese names ''mingyuezhizhu'' and ''yeguangzhu'' may have an Indian origin, with analogs in the ''chandra-k\u00e2nta'' (\"moon-beloved\") gem that contains condensed moonlight and the ''harinma\u1e47i'' (\"moon-jewel\") name for emerald (1931: 168-169). \n\n[[File:Qing Dynasty Dish with dragons.jpg|thumb|[[Qing dynasty]] plate with two dragons and a flaming pearl]]\n[[Li Shizhen]]'s 1578 ''[[Bencao Gangmu]]'' pharmacopeia describes ''leizhu'' (\u96f7\u73e0, \"thunder pearls/beads\") that the divine dragon ''[[shenlong]]'' \"held in its mouth and dropped. They light the entire house at night\" (tr. Laufer 1912: 64). [[Chinese dragon]]s are frequently depicted with a [[Eight Treasures|flaming pearl]] or gem under their chin or in their claws. According to the German anthropologist [[Wolfram Eberhard]], the ''long'' dragon is a symbol of clouds and rainstorms, and when it plays with a ball or pearl, this signifies the swallowing of the moon by the clouds or thunder in the clouds. The moon frequently appears as a pearl, and thus the dragon with the pearl is equal to the clouds with the moon. The pearl-moon relationship is expressed in the Chinese belief that at full moon pearls are solid balls and at new moon they are hollow. (1968: 239, 382).\n\nThe [[Talmudic]] c. 350-500 CE ''[[Gemara]]'' has several references to luminous gems. For example, [[Abraham]] was allegedly so jealous of his many wives that he incarcerated them in a city of iron with walls so high that neither the sun nor moon could be seen. However, he \"provided a great bowl filled with jewels which lighted up the whole building\" (Ball 1938: 499).\n\nThe best documented of the illumination tales is that of the [[King of Ceylon]]'s luminous carbuncle or ruby, first mentioned by the Greek traveler [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]] in the 6th century and thereafter described by many travelers, the latest of the 17th century. According to Indicopleustes, it was \"as large as a great pine-cone, fiery red, and when seen flashing from a distance, especially if the sun's rays are playing around it, being a matchless sight\" (Laufer 1915: 62). The Chinese Buddhist pilgrim [[Xuanzang]]'s 646 ''[[Great Tang Records on the Western Regions]]'' locates it in the Buddha Tooth Temple near [[Anuradhapura]], \"Its magical brilliance illumines the whole heaven. In the calm of a clear and cloudless night it can be seen by all, even at a distance of a myriad ''[[Li (unit)|li]]''.\" The Song Scholar [[Zhao Rukuo]]'s c. 1225 ''[[Zhu Fan Zhi]]'' (\"Records of Foreign People\") says, \"The king holds in his hand a jewel five inches in diameter, which cannot be burnt by fire, and which shines in (the darkness of) night like a torch. The king rubs his face with it daily, and though he were passed ninety he would retain his youthful looks.\" (Hirth and Rockhill 1911: 73). Based on this incombustibility, Laufer says this night-shining jewel was probably a diamond (1915: 63). Others state that it \"serves instead of a lamp at night\", has \"the appearance of a glowing fire\", or of that \"of a great flame of fire.\" Due to its luminescence, [[Marco Polo]] called it \"The Red Palace Illuminator\" (Ball 1938: 499).\n\nThe English alchemist John Norton wrote a 1470 poem entitled \"Ordinal, or a manual of the chemical art\", in which he proposed erecting a gold bridge over the [[River Thames]] and illuminating it with carbuncles set on golden pinnacles, \"A glorious thing for men to beholde\" ([[Elias Ashmole|Ashmole]] 1652: 27).\n\nBoats lit by luminous gems are a variant of the illumination idea. There is an old rabbinical tradition that \"[[Noah]] had a luminous stone in the [[Noah's Ark|Ark]] that \"shone more brightly by night than by day, thus serving to distinguish day and night when the sun and moon were shrouded by dense clouds.\" (Harvey 1957: 15). The Mormon ''[[Book of Ether]]'' describes \"sixteen small stones; and they were white and clear, even as transparent glass\", being touched by God's hand so that they might \"shine forth in darkness.\" The [[Jaredites]] placed a stone fore and aft on each ship and had \"light continually\" during their 344-day voyage to America (Ball 1938: 500).\n\nThe theme of luminous gems guiding mariners and others originated in Europe in the Middle Ages. The earliest is probably the [[Scandinavian saga]] of the [[Visby]] garnets. In the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] city Visby, on the island of [[Gotland]], the Church of St. Nicholas had two [[rose window]]s with huge garnets in the center, overlooking the [[Baltic Sea]]. Sagas say the two gems shone at night as brightly as did the sun at noon and guided mariners safely to port. In 1361 King [[Valdemar IV]] of Denmark conquered Gotland, but his rich booty, including the marvelous garnets, sank in the ocean when the king's ship was wrecked on the [[Kong Karls Land]] islands (Ball 1938: 500). \n\nThe [[Relic#Christianity|relic]] of the [[Virgin Mary]]'s wedding ring, which according to different accounts had an onyx, amethyst, or green jasper, was supposedly brought back from the [[Holy Land]] in 996 CE. It was placed in the Church of [[Santa Mustiola]], [[Clusium]] (modern [[Chiusi]]), Italy, and in 1473 the ring was transferred to the Franciscan monastery in that city. One of the monks stole it and fled into the night, but when he repented and promised to return it, the ring emitted a bright light by which he traveled to [[Perugia]]. The two cities fought fiercely for the possession of this sacred ring, but in 1486 the Vatican decreed the relic should be placed in the [[Perugia Cathedral]] (Ball 1938: 500). \n\nThe Dutch scholar [[Alardus of Amsterdam]] (1491\u20131544) relates the history of a luminous \"chrysolampis\" (\u03c7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03b9\u03c2, \"gold-gleaming\") gem set on a golden tablet with other valuable gemstones. Around 975, Hildegard, wife of [[Dirk II, Count of Holland]], dedicated the tablet to Saint [[Adalbert of Egmond]] and presented it to [[Egmond Abbey]], where the saint's body reposed. Alardus tells us that the \"chrysolampis\" \"shone so brightly that when the monks were called to the chapel in the nighttime, they could read the [[Book of hours|Hours]] without any other light,\" however this brilliant gem was stolen by one of the monks and thrown into the sea (Kunz 1913: 164).\n\nThe French chemist [[Marcellin Berthelot]] (1888) discovered an early Greek alchemical text \"from the sanctuary of the temple\" that says the Egyptians produced \"the carbuncle that shines in the night\" from certain phosphorescent parts (\"the bile\") of marine animals, and when properly prepared these precious gems would glow so brightly at night \"that anyone owning such a stone could read or write by its light as well as he could by daylight.\" (Kunz 1913: 173).\n\n===Gem mining legends===\n[[File:Forsterite-Olivine-tmu14a.jpg|thumb|[[Peridot]] from [[Zabargad Island]]]]\n[[File:Scheelite sous U.V. (Chine) .jpg|thumb|[[Scheelite]] under [[ultraviolet]] light]]\n[[File:Willemite-Calcite-225254.jpg|thumb|[[Willemite]] under ultraviolet light]]\nSecond, there are stories about miners finding luminous gems at night and extracting them by day (Ball 1938: 500-501). One notable exception is Pliny's c. 77 CE ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' that describes finding carbuncles in the daytime, some kinds \"doe glitter and shine of their owne nature: by reason whereof, they are discovered soone wheresoever they lie, by the reverberation of the Sun-beams\" (Harvey 1957: 34).\n\nIn the 1st century BCE, the Greek historians [[Diodorus Siculus]] (c. 90-30) and [[Strabo]] (c. 63-24) both record the [[peridot]] (gem-quality [[olivine]]) mine of Egyptian king [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] (r. 285\u2013246 BCE) on the barren, forbidden island of Ophiodes ({{linktext|\u1f48\u03c6\u03b9\u03ce\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2|\u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2}}, \"Snakey\") or Topazios ({{linktext|\u03a4\u03bf\u03c0\u03ac\u03b6\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2}}, \"Topaz\"), modern [[Zabargad Island]], off the ancient [[Red Sea]] port [[Berenice Troglodytica]].\nDiodorus says Philadelphus exterminated the \"divers sorts of dreadful Serpents\" that formerly infested on the island on account of the \"Topaz, a resplendent Stone, of a delightful Aspect, like to Glass, of a Golden colour, and of admirable brightness; and therefore all were forbidden to set footing upon that Place; and if any landed there, he was presently put to death by the Keepers of the Island.\" The Egyptian mining technique relied upon luminosity. \"This Stone grows in the Rocks, darken'd by the brightness of the Sun; it's not seen in the Day, but shines bright and glorious in the darkest Night, and discovers it self at a great distance. The Keepers of the Island disperse themselves into several Places to search for this stone, and wherever it appears, they mark the Place, with a great Vessel of largeness sufficient to cover the sparkling Stone; and then in the Day time, go to the Place, and cut out the Stone, and deliver it to those that are Artists in polishing of 'em.\" (tr. Oldfather et al. 1814 3: 36). According to Strabo, \"The topaz is a transparent stone sparkling with a golden lustre, which, however, is not easy to be distinguished in the day-time, on account of the brightness of the surrounding light, but at night the stones are visible to those who collect them. The collectors place a vessel over the spot [where the topazes are seen] as a mark, and dig them up in the day.\" (tr. Hamilton and Falconer 1889 3:103). Ball notes that the legendary \"topaz\" of Topazios island is olivine, which is not luminescent while true topaz is, and suggests, \"This tale may well have been told to travelers by astute Egyptian gem merchants anxious to enhance the value of their wares by exaggerating the dangers inherent to procuring the olivines.\" (1938: 500). In the present day, the island mine is now submerged underwater and inaccessible.\n\nThe theme of locating luminous gems at night is found in other sources. The c. 125 CE didactic Christian text ''[[Physiologus]]'' states that the diamond (\"carbuncle\") is not to be found in the day but only at night, which may imply that it emits light (Laufer 1915:62). The Anglo-Indian diplomat [[Thomas Douglas Forsyth]] says that in 632, the ancient Iranian [[Saka]] Buddhist [[Kingdom of Khotan]] sent a \"splendid jade stone\" as tribute to [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]]. Khotan's rivers were famous for their jade, \"which was discovered by its shining in the water at night\", and divers would procure it in shallow waters after the snowmelt floods had subsided (1875: 113). The [[Bohemian]] rabbi [[Petachiah of Regensburg]] (d. c. 1225) adapted Strabo's story for the gold he saw in the land of Ishmael, east of [[Nineveh]], where \"the gold grows like herbs. In the night its brightness is seen when a mark is made with dust or lime. They then come in the morning and gather the herbs upon which the gold is found.\" (tr. Benisch and Ainsworth 1856: 51, 53).\n\nA modern parallel to ancient miners seeking luminous gems at nighttime is mineworkers using portable [[Ultraviolet#Short-wave ultraviolet lamps|shortwave ultraviolet lamps]] to locate ores that respond with color-specific fluorescence. For instance, under short-wave UV light, [[scheelite]], a [[tungsten]] ore, fluoresces a bright sky-blue, and [[willemite]], a minor ore of [[zinc]], fluoresces green (Ball 1938: 501). \n\n===Animal legends===\nThe third luminous-gem theme involves serpents (of Hindu origin), or small animals (Spanish), with gems in their heads, or grateful animals repaying human kindness (Chinese and Roman) (Ball 1938: 501-505).\n\nLegends about snakes that carry a marvelous jewel either in their forehead or in their mouth are found almost worldwide. Scholars have suggested that the myth may have originated with [[snake worship]], or light reflected by a serpent's eye, or the flame color of certain snakes' lips. In only a relative few of these legends is the stone luminous, this variant being known in India, Ceylon, ancient Greece, Armenia, and among Cherokee Indians (Ball 1938: 502).\n\nThe Hindu polymath [[Var\u0101hamihira]]'s 6th century ''Brhat Samhit'' encyclopedic work describes the bright star [[Canopus]], named Agastya ([[wikt:\u0905\u0917\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u092f|\u0905\u0917\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u092f]]) in Sanskrit, also the name of the [[Rishis|rishi]] [[Agastya]], \"Its huge white waves looked like clouds; its gems looked like stars; its crystals looked like the Moon; and its long bright serpents bearing gems in their hoods looked like comets and thus the whole sea looked like the sky.\" Another context says black glossy pearls are also produced in the heads of serpents related to the [[n\u0101gar\u0101ja]] ([[wikt:\u0928\u093e\u0917\u0930\u093e\u091c|\u0928\u093e\u0917\u0930\u093e\u091c]], \"dragon kings\") [[Takshaka]] and [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]] (tr. Iyer 1884: 77, 179).\n\nThe \"Snake Jewel\" story in Somadeva's 11th-century ''[[Kathasaritsagara]]'' (\"Ocean of the Streams of Stories\") refers to a ''[[wikt:ma\u1e47i|ma\u1e47i]]'' ([[wikt:\u092e\u0923\u093f#Sanskrit| \u092e\u0923\u093f]], \"gem; jewel; pearl\") on a snake's head. When the Hindu mythological king [[Nala]] is fleeing from a jungle wildfire, he hears a voice asking for help and turns back to see a snake \"having his head encircled with the rays of the jewels of his crest\", who, after being rescued reveals himself to be the n\u0101gar\u0101ja [[Karkotaka]] (tr. Tawney 1928 4: 245).\n\nThe 3rd-century CE ''[[Life of Apollonius of Tyana]]'', the Greek [[sophist]] [[Philostratus]]'s biography of [[Apollonius of Tyana]] (c. 3 BCE-97 CE), says that in India, people will kill a mountain dragon and cut off its head, in which, \"are stones of rich lustre, emitting every-coloured rays and of occult virtue.\" It also mentions a myth that cranes will not build their nests until they have affixed a \"light-stone\" (Ancient Greek ''[[wikt:lychnidis|lychnidis]]'', \"shining\") to help the eggs hatch and to drive away snakes (tr. [[Frederick Cornwallis Conybeare|Conybeare]] 1912: 103, 155).\n\nIn the [[Bengal]]i tale of \"[[The Twelve Dancing Princesses#Variants|The Rose of Bak\u00e1wal\u00ed]]\", the heroic prince Jamila Khatun encounters a monstrous dragon that carried in its mouth \"a serpent which emitted a gem so brilliant that it lighted up the jungle for many miles\". His plan to obtain it was to throw a heavy lump of clay on the luminous gem, plunging the jungle into darkness, \"so that the dragon and the serpent knocked their heads against the stones and died.\" (tr. [[William Alexander Clouston|Clouston]] 1889: 296-297).\n\nAccording to [[Armenia]]n \"The Queen of the Serpents\" legend, the serpents of [[Mount Ararat]] select a queen who destroys invading armies of foreign serpents, and carries in her mouth a \"wonderful stone, the Hul, or stone of light, which upon certain nights she tosses in the air, when it shines as the sun. Happy the man who shall catch the stone ere it falls.\" ([[August von Haxthausen|von Haxthausen]] 1854: 355).\n\n[[Henry Timberlake]], the British emissary to the [[Overhill Cherokee]] during the 1761-1762 [[Timberlake Expedition]], records a story about [[medicine men]] (\"conjurers\") using gemstones, which is a variant of the [[Horned Serpent]] legend in [[Iroquois mythology]]. One luminous gem \"remarkable for its brilliancy and beauty\" supposedly \"grew on the head of a mon\u0283trous \u0283erpent\" that was guarded by many snakes. The medicine man hid this luminous gemstone, and no one else had seen it. Timberlake supposed he had \"hatched the account of its difcovery\" (1765: 48-49). Ball doubts the myth and suggests \"European influence\" (1938: 503).\n\nThe [[Catalonia|Catalan]] missionary [[Jordanus]]'s c. 1330 ''[[Jordanus#Mirabilia|Mirabilia]]'' says he heard that the dragons of India Tertia (Eastern African, south of Abyssinia) have on their heads \"the lustrous stones which we call carbuncles.\" When they become too large to fly, they fall and die in a \"certain river which issues from Paradise\". After seventy days the people recover the \"carbuncle which is rooted in the top of his head\" and take it to [[Prester John]], the Emperor of the Ethiopians (tr. [[Henry Yule|Yule]] 1863: 42)\n\nAfter his third visit to Persia in 1686, the French jeweler and traveler [[John Chardin]] wrote that the Egyptian carbuncle was \"very probably only an Oriental Ruby of higher Colour than usual.\" The Persians call it ''Icheb Chirac'', the Flambeau [\"burning torch\"] of the Night because of the property and Quality it has of enlightening all things round it\", and \"They tell you that the Carbuncle was bred within the Head of a Dragon, a Griffin, or a Royal Eagle, which was found upon the Mountain of Caf.\" (Chardin 2010: 166-167)\n\nLike Chardin's griffin or eagle, some stories about luminous gems involve animals other than snakes and dragons. An early example is the 3rd-century CE Greek Pseudo-Callisthenes ''[[Alexander romance|Romance of Alexander]]'' that says [[Alexander the Great]] once speared a fish, \"in whose bowels was found a white stone so brilliant that everyone believed it was a lamp. Alexander set it in gold, and used it as a lamp at night.\" (Laufer 1915: 58). \n\nSydney H. Ball recounts the widespread variation of the animal-gratitude snake story involving a wild animal (often called ''carbuncle'', Spanish ''[[wikt:carbunclo|carbunclo]]'', or Latin ''[[wikt:carbunculo|carbunculo]]'') with a luminous gem on its head, and which Europeans apparently introduced into Africa and America.\n\nIn 1565, Don John Bermudez, ambassador of [[Prester John]] to [[John III of Portugal]], described an Upper [[Nile]] snake called \"Of the shadow, or Canopie, because it hath a skinne on the head wherewith it covereth a very precious stone, which they say it hath in her head.\" ([[Samuel Purchas|Purchas]] 1625 2: 1169). \n\nThe English merchant [[William Finch (merchant)|William Finch]] reported around 1608 a [[Sierra Leone]] story about a wolf-like creature with a luminous gem. \"The Negros told us of a strange beast (which the interpreter called a Carbuncle) oft seene yet only by night, having a stone in his forehead, incredibly shining and giving him light to feed, attentive to the least noyse, which he no sooner heareth, but he presently covereth the same with a filme or skinne given him as a naturall covering that his splendour betray him not.\" ([[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] 1857: 124).\n\nIn 1666, another version of the theme is a huge snake recorded from [[Island Caribs]] on the island of [[Dominica]], [[West Indies]]. \"On its head was a very sparkling stone, like a Carbuncle, of inestimable price: That it commonly veil'd that rich Jewel with a thin moving skin, like that of a man's eye-lid: but that when it went to drink or sported himself in the midst of that deep bottom, he fully discover'd it, and that the rocks and all about receiv'd a wonderful lustre from the fire issuing out of that precious crown.\" (de Rochefort 1666: 15).\n\nAccording to the Swiss explorer [[Johann Jakob von Tschudi]], in the highlands of [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]], the native peoples tell stories of a fabulous beast with a luminous gem. \"The carbunculo is represented to be of the size of a fox, with long black hair, and is only visible at night, when it slinks slowly through the thickets. If followed, he opens a flap or valve in the forehead, from under which an extraordinary, brilliant, and dazzling light issues. The natives believe that this light proceeds from a brilliant precious stone, and that any fool hardy person who may venture to grasp at it rashly is blinded; then the flap is let down, and the animal disappears in the darkness.\" ([[Johann Jakob von Tschudi|von Tschudi]] 1854: 320). The American archeologist [[Adolph Francis Alphonse Bandelier]] cites von Tschudi and describes the carbunculo as a cat with a blood-red jewel, which is supposed to dwell on [[Nevado Sajama]] mountain, near [[Oruro Department|Oruro]], [[Bolivia]]. Bandelier believes his Bolivian informants that the carbunculo has existed from the earliest times, and \"certainly before the conquest, so that its introduction cannot be attributed to the Spaniards\" (1910: 320). Nevertheless, based upon how closely the above American versions of the myth follow the pattern of the European form, Ball concludes that the Spaniards introduced the carbuncle myth (1938: 504).\n\nIn contrast to the above legends about people killing snakes and animals in order to obtain their luminous gems, another group of legends has a theme of injured animals presenting magical gems out of gratitude to people who helped them. This is a subcategory of [[Aarne\u2013Thompson classification systems#Use in folkloristics|The Grateful Animals]] folktale motif ([[Aarne\u2013Thompson classification systems]] 554), for example, [[The White Snake]] or [[The Queen Bee]]. \n\nThese animal-gratitude stories are first recorded around two millennia ago in China and Rome. Based upon striking coincidences in Chinese and Roman versions of the story, Laufer reasoned that there was an obvious historical connection (1915: 59-60), and Ball believes these tales probably originated independently (1938: 504).\n\n[[File:Bi with two dragons and grain pattern.jpg|thumb|[[ Bi (jade)|Bi]] jade-disk with a dual dragon motif, [[Warring States period]]]]\nThe earliest known story about a grateful animal with a luminous gem is the Chinese ''Suihouzhu'' (\u96a8\u4faf\u73e0, \"the Marquis of Sui's pearl\") legend that a year after he saved the life of a wounded snake, it returned and gave him a fabulous pearl that emitted a light as bright as that of the moon (Ball 1938: 504). [[Sui (state)|Sui]] (\u96a8, cf. \u968b [[Sui dynasty]]), located in present-day [[Suizhou]], [[Hubei]], was a lesser feudal state during the [[Zhou dynasty]] (c.\u20091046 BC\u2013256 BCE) and a [[State (Ancient China)|vassal state]] of [[Chu (state)|Chu]]. Several [[Warring States period]] (c. 475-221 BCE) texts mention Marquis Sui's pearl as a metaphor for something important or valuable, but without explaining the grateful snake tale, which implies that it was common knowledge among contemporary readers.\n\nThe [[Marquis of Sui's pearl]] is mentioned in the ''[[Zhan Guo Ce|Zhanguo ci]]'' (\"Strategies of the Warring States\") compendium of political and military anecdotes dating from 490 to 221 BCE. [[King Wuling of Zhao]] (r. 325\u2013299 BCE) summoned Zheng Tong (\u912d\u540c) for an audience and asked how to avoid warfare with neighboring feudal states. Zheng Tong replied, 'Well, let us suppose there is a man who carries with him the pearl of Sui-hou and the Ch'ih-ch'iu armband [\u6301\u4e18\u4e4b\u74b0, uncertain] as well as goods valued at ten thousand in gold. Now he stops the night in an uninhabited place.\" Since he has neither weapons nor protectors, \"It is clear he will not spend more than a night abroad before someone harms him. At the moment there are powerful and greedy states on your majesty's borders and they covet your land. \u2026 If you lack weapons your neighbours, of course, will be quite satisfied.\" (tr. Crump 1970: 327).\n\nThe c. 3rd-1st centuries BCE Daoist ''[[Zhuangzi (book)]]'' alludes to the marquis's pearl. \"Whenever the sage makes a movement, he is certain to examine what his purpose is and what he is doing. If now, however, we suppose that there were a man who shot at a sparrow a thousand yards away with the pearl of the Marquis of Sui, the world would certainly laugh at him. Why is this? It is because what he uses is important and what he wants is insignificant. And is not life much more important than the pearl of the Marquis of Sui?\" (tr. Mair 1994: 288).\n\nSeveral [[Chinese classics]] pair the legendary ''Suihouzhu'' (\"the Marquis of Sui's pearl\") with another priceless gem, the ''Heshibi'' (\u548c\u6c0f\u74a7, \"[[Mr. He's jade]]\"). The ''[[Bi (jade)|bi]]'' is a type of circular [[Chinese jade]] artifact, and \"Mr. He\" was Bian He (\u535e\u548c), who found a marvelous piece of raw jade that went cruelly unrecognized by successive Chu monarchs until it was finally acknowledged as a priceless jewel. The c. 3rd-1st century BCE ''[[Chuci]]'' (\"Songs of [[Chu (state)|Chu]]\") mentions the paired gems, \"Shards and stones are prized as jewels / Sui and He rejected\". This poetic anthology also says, \"It grieves me that shining pearls [\u660e\u73e0] should be cast out in the mire / While worthless fish-eye stones are treasured in a strong-box\", and describes a flying chariot, \"Fringed with the dusky Moon Bright pearls [\u660e\u6708\u4e4b\u7384\u73e0]\" (tr. Hawkes 1985: 277, 295, 290). King [[Liu An]]'s c. 139 BCE ''[[Huainanzi]]'' (\"Philosophers of Huainan\") uses the story to describe one who has attained the Way of Heaven ([[wikt:\u5929\u9053|\u5929\u9053]]), \"It is like the pearl of Marquis Sui or the jade disk of Mr. He. Those who achieved it became rich; those who lost it became poor.\" (tr. Major et al. 2010: 218).\n\nThe c. 222 CE ''[[Claudius Aelianus#De Natura Animalium|De Natura Animalium]]'' (\"On the Characteristics of Animals\"), compiled by Roman author [[Claudius Aelianus]], told the story of Heraclea or Herakleis, a virtuous widow of [[Taranto|Tarentum]], who after seeing a fledgling stork fall and break its leg, nursed it back to health, and set it free. One year later, as Heraclea sat at the door of her cottage, the young stork returned and dropped a precious stone into her lap, and she put it indoors. Awakening that night, she saw that the gem \"diffused a brightness and a gleam, and the house was lit up as though a torch had been brought in, so strong a radiance came from, and was engendered by, the lump of stone.\" (tr. [[A. F. Scholfield|Scholfield]] 1959: 209-210).\n\nLaufer cites three c. 4th-century Chinese grateful-animal stories that parallel Heraclea's stork. The ''[[Shi Yi Ji|Shiyi ji]]'' (\"Researches into Lost Records\"), compiled by the Daoist scholar [[Wang Jia]] (d. 390 CE) from early apocryphal versions of Chinese history, recounts an anecdote about King Zhao of [[Yan (state)|Yan]] (\u71d5\u662d\u738b, r. 311\u2013279 BCE) and grateful birds with ''dongguangzhu'' (\u6d1e\u5149\u73e0, \"cave shining pearls\"). \n<blockquote>When Prince Chao of Yen was once seated on a terrace, black birds with white heads flocked there together, holding in their beaks perfectly resplendent pearls, measuring one foot all round. These pearls were black as lacquer, and emitted light in the interior of a house to such a degree that even the spirits could not obscure their supernatural essence.\" (tr. Laufer 1915: 59). </blockquote>\nThe imperial historian [[Gan Bao]]'s c. 350 CE ''[[Soushen Ji]]'' (\"In Search of the Supernatural\") has two grateful-animal stories involving luminous pearls/gems. The first involves a black crane; according to legend, when a crane has lived a thousand years it turns blue; after another thousand it becomes black and is called a ''xuanhe'' (\u7384\u9db4. \"dark crane\").\n<blockquote>Kuai Shen [\u5672\u53c3] was the most filial son to his mother. Once a black crane was injured by a bow hunter and in its extremity, went to Kuai. The latter took it in, doctored its wound, and when it was cured set it free. Soon afterwards the crane showed up again outside Kuai's door. The latter shone a torch to see out and discovered its mate there too. Each of them held a single night-glowing pearl [\u660e\u73e0] in its beak to repay Kuai. (tr. DeWoskin and Crump 1996: 238). </blockquote>\nThe second story is oldest detailed explanation of Marquis of Sui's pearl.\n<blockquote>Once upon a time, when the ruler of the old Sui kingdom was journeying, he came upon a great wounded serpent whose back was broken. The ruler believed the creature to be a spirit manifestation and ordered his physician to treat it with drugs to close up its wound. Thereafter the serpent was able to move again, and the place was called Mound of the Wounded Serpent. One year later the serpent brought a bright pearl [\u660e\u73e0] in its mouth to give the ruler of Sui to show its gratitude. The pearl was greater than an inch in diameter, of the purest white and emitted light like moonglow. In the dark it could illuminate an entire room. For these reasons it was known as \"Duke Sui's Pearl\" [\u968b\u4faf\u73e0] or the \"Spirit Snake's Pearl\" [\u9748\u86c7\u73e0], or, again, the \"Moonlight Pearl\" [\u660e\u6708\u73e0]. (tr. DeWoskin and Crump 1996: 239). </blockquote>\nLaufer concludes that the \"coincidences in these three Chinese versions and the story of the Greek author, even in unimportant details such as the thankful bird returning after one year to the marquis of Sui, are so striking, that an historical connection between the two is obvious.\" (1915: 60).\n\nA later elaboration of animal-gratitude stories involves grateful animals and ungrateful people, who are typically rescued from a [[pitfall trap]] (Ashliman 2010). Two versions mention marvelous gems. The English historian [[Matthew Paris]]'s c. 1195 ''Chronicles'' says that [[Richard I of England]] (1157-1199) used to tell a parable about ungrateful people. A Venetian, Vitalis, was rescued from a horrible death by a ladder being let down into a pit into which he had fallen. A lion and a serpent trapped in the same pit used his ladder to escape, and the lion in gratitude brought to Vitalis a goat he had killed and the snake a luminous jewel that he carried in his mouth. As Richard reportedly told the story after his return from the [[Crusades]] he may have heard it in the East, as similar stories, but without the stone being luminous, occur in two Indian collections, the c. 300 BCE ''[[Panchatantra|Kalila wa Dimnah]]'' and the 11th-century ''[[Kathasaritsagara]]'' (Ball 1938: 505). The English poet [[John Gower]]'s 1390 ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' tells the story of the rich Roman lord Adrian and the poor [[Firewood|woodcutter]] Bardus. Adrian falls into a pit that had already captured an ape and a serpent, and promises to give half his wealth to Bardus for pulling him out. After Bardus rescues the three, out of gratitude the ape piled up firewood for him and the serpent gave him \"a stone more bright than cristall out of his mouth\", but Adrian refuses to pay his debt. Bardus sells the luminous gem for gold and afterwards found it again in his purse, and the same thing happened every time he sold it. Emperor [[Justinian I]] summons Bardus, listens to his testimony supported by the magically reappearing gem, and compels Adrian to fulfill his promise (tr. [[William Alexander Clouston|Clouston]] 1887 1: 224-226).\n\nSome scholars were skeptical about luminous gem stories. In the West, the earliest nonbeliever was the Portuguese traveler to India and gem expert, [[Garcia de Orta]] (1563), who, having been told by a jeweler of a luminous carbuncle, doubted its existence. In the East, the first recorded skeptic was the Chinese encyclopedist [[Song Yingxing]], who in 1628 wrote \"it is not true that there are pearls emitting light at the hour of the dusk or night.\" (Ball 1938: 505).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cintamani]], a wish-fulfilling jewel in Hindu and Buddhist traditions \n*[[Mani Jewel]], various legendary jewels mentioned in Buddhist texts\n*[[Indra's net]], Buddhist metaphor of a vast net with a jewel or pearl at each knot, infinitely reflecting all the other jewels\n\n==References== \n*Ashliman, D.

Some stories about light-emitting gems may have been based on [[luminescent]] and [[phosphorescent]] minerals such as diamonds.\n\n==Mineralogical luminosity ==\n[[File:Thermolumine.png|thumb|[[Thermoluminescence]] from heating [[chlorophane]] specimens on a hotplate.]]\n[[File:Tribo.ogv|thumb|[[Triboluminescence]] from rubbing together two [[quartz]] crystals.]]\nFirst, it will be useful to introduce some [[mineralogical]] terminology for [[gemstones]] that can glow when exposed to light, friction, or heat. Note that the following discussion will omit modern techniques such as [[X-rays]] and [[ultraviolet light]] that are too recent to have influenced folklore about luminous gems. [[Luminescence]] is [[spontaneous emission]] of [[light]] by a substance not resulting from heat, as distinguished from [[incandescence]], which is light emitted by a substance as a result of heating. Luminescence is caused by the absorption of energy that is released in small amounts. When the energy comes from light or other [[electromagnetic radiation]], it is referred to as [[photoluminescence]]; which is divisible between [[fluorescence]] when the glow ceases immediately with the excitation and [[phosphorescence]] when the glow continues beyond the period of excitation. Two types of luminescent phenomena are relevant to [[crystalline]] materials. [[Triboluminescence]] generates light through the breaking of [[chemical bond]]s in a material when it is rubbed, pulled apart, scratched, or crushed. [[Thermoluminescence]] re-emits previously absorbed electromagnetic radiation upon being heated (e.g., [[thermoluminescence dating]]).\n\nThe American geologist [[Sydney Hobart Ball]], who wrote an article on \"Luminous Gems, Mythical and Real\", outlined the history of discoveries about luminescent and phosphorescent minerals. Most [[diamonds]] are triboluminescent if rubbed with a cloth, and a few are photoluminescent after exposure to direct sunlight. Both diamonds and white [[topaz]] may phosphoresce if heated below [[red heat]]. The phosphorescent quality of diamonds when heated by sunlight is usually believed to have been first revealed by [[Albertus Magnus]] (c. 1193-1280) and it was apparently rediscovered by [[Robert Boyle]] in 1663, who also found that some diamonds will luminesce under pressure. According to [[Prafulla Chandra Ray]], the Indian king [[Bhoja]] (r. 1010\u20131055) knew that diamonds can phosphoresce (Ball 1938: 496). \n\nThe luminescent [[Bologna Stone]] (impure [[barite]]), which was discovered by Vincenzo Cascariolo in 1602, was sometimes called \"{{linktext|lapis |lunaris}}\" (\"lunar stone\"), because, like the moon, it gave out in the darkness the light it received from the sun (Kunz 1913: 168). In 1735, the French chemist [[Charles Fran\u00e7ois de Cisternay du Fay]] determined that [[lapis lazuli]], [[emerald]], and [[aquamarine (gemstone)|aquamarine]] were luminescent. [[Josiah Wedgwood]], in 1792, found phosphoresce from rubbing together two pieces of quartz or of [[agate]], and wrote that the [[ruby]] gives \"a beautiful red light of short continuance.\" [[Edmond Becquerel]] reported in 1861 that ruby fluoresces better than [[sapphire]], red [[feldspar]] fluoresces, and crushed [[orthoclase]] will flame. In 1833, [[David Brewster]] discovered the fluorescence of the mineral [[fluorite]] or fluorspar. However, the English naturalist [[Philip Skippon (1641\u20131691)|Philip Skippon]] (1641\u20131691) stated that one Monsieur Lort, of [[Montpellier]], France, a \"counterfeiter\" of \"amethysts, topazes, emeralds, and sapphires\" found that on heating \"''[[wikt:fluor#Latin|fluor]] [[wikt:smaragdi#Latin|smaragdi]]''\" (Latin for \"flowing emerald/beryl/jasper\") in a pan of coals and afterwards \"putting it in a dark place (it) shines very much: At the same time several other stones were tried but did not shine.\" (1732 6: 718).\n\nSome fluorite, particularly the variety [[chlorophane]] (aka pyroemerald and cobra stone), will become luminescent simply from the heat of one's hand. Chlorophane is unusual for combining the properties of thermoluminescence, triboluminescence, phosphorescence, and fluorescence; it will emit [[visible spectrum]] light when rubbed, or exposed to light or heat, and can continue emitting for a long period of time. Among the gravels of the [[Irtysh River]], near [[Krasnoyarsk]], Russia, the German mineralogist [[Gustav Rose]] recorded seeing chlorophane pebbles that shone with brilliancy all night long, merely from exposure to the sun's heat. For luminous gem myths, Ball concludes that while it is \"not impossible that the inventors of certain of the [luminous gem] tales may have been acquainted with the luminosity of gems, in my opinion many of the tales must be of other origin\" (1938: 497).\n\nScholars have proposed many identifications for myths about luminous gemstones described for over two thousand years. Most frequently rubies or [[carbuncle (gemstone)|carbuncles]] (often red [[garnet]]s), which classical and medieval mineralogists did not differentiate, and less commonly other gems, including diamonds, emeralds, jade, and pearls (Ball 1938: 497). \n\nThe American sinologist [[Edward H. Schafer]] proposes that the phosphorescent \"emeralds\" of classical antiquity, such as the brilliantly shining green eyes of the marble lion on the tomb of King [[Hermias of Atarneus]] (d. 341 BCE) on Cyprus, were [[fluorite]], even though the Hellenistic alchemists had methods, \"seemingly magical, of making night-shining gems by the application of phosphorescent paints to stones\", the most famous being their \"emeralds\" and \"carbuncles.\" (1963: 238).\n\nThe names of some luminescent gemstones etymologically derive from \"glow\" or \"fire\" words (e.g., ''pyroemerald'' for \"chlorophane\" above). \nThe ''[[OED]]'' defines ''[[pyrope]]'' (from Greek \u03a0\u03c5\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03cc\u03c2, lit. \"fire-eyed\")\" as: \"In early use applied vaguely to a red or fiery gem, as ruby or carbuncle; (mineralogy) the Bohemian garnet or fire-garnet\"; and ''[[Carbuncle (gemstone)|carbuncle]]'' or ''carbuncle-stone'' (from Latin \"carbunculus,\" \"small glowing ember\") as: \"A name variously applied to precious stones of a red or fiery colour; the carbuncles of the ancients (of which Pliny describes twelve varieties) were probably sapphires, spinels or rubies, and garnets; in the Middle Ages and later, besides being a name for the ruby, the term was esp. applied to a mythical gem said to emit a light in the dark.\" (Ball 1938: 498).\n<gallery>\nFile:Beryl-209736.jpg|[[Aquamarine (gemstone)|Aquamarine]]\nFile:Barite-d05-36a.jpg|[[Barite]]\nFile:Cobra-stone (Nagamani).jpg|[[Chlorophane]]\nFile:DiamanteEZ.jpg|[[Diamond]]\nFile:B\u00e9ryl var. \u00e9meraude sur gangue (Muzo Mine Boyaca - Colombie) 2.jpg|[[Emerald]] \nFile:Museo de La Plata - Feldespato.jpg|[[Feldspar]]\nFile:Fluorite-132158.jpg|[[Fluorite]]\nFile:Forsterite orange - Ochtendung, Eifel, Germany.jpg|[[Fosterite]]\nFile:Grossular-ww51a.jpg|[[Garnet]]\nFile:Lapis-lazuli hg.jpg|[[Lapis lazuli]]\nFile:Olivine-23909.jpg|[[Olivine]]\nFile:Forsterite-Olivine-tmu14a.jpg|[[Peridot]]\nFile:Garnet Group-Pyrope Iron aluminum silicate Barton Mines, Gore Mountain, Warren County, New York 2861.jpg|[[Pyrope]] \nFile:Quartz oisan.jpg|[[Quartz]]\nFile:Corundum-denv08-11b.jpg|[[Ruby]]\nFile:Corundum-190227.jpg|[[Sapphire]]\nFile:Sp3.jpg|[[Spinel]]\nFile:Topaze blanche 3 (Br\u00e9sil).jpg|[[Topaz]]\nFile:Tourmaline-20576.jpg|[[Tourmaline]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Mythological luminosity==\nLuminous gems are common theme in [[comparative mythology]]. Ball [[Cross-cultural studies|cross-culturally]] analyzed stories about luminous stones and pearls and found about one hundred variants in ancient, medieval, and modern sources. The wide-ranging locations of the tales comprise all Asia (except Siberia), all Europe (except Norway and Russia), Borneo, New Guinea, the United States, Canada, certain South American countries and Abyssinia, French Congo, and Angola in Africa. The later African and American myths were likely introduced by Europeans. Ball divides legends about luminous gems into three principal themes: [[List of light sources|light source]]s, gem mining, and animals (Ball 1938: 497-498).\n\n===Light source legends===\nThe first theme is using legendary luminous gems to illuminate buildings, for [[navigation light]]s on ships, or sometimes as guiding lights for lost persons (Ball 1938: 498-500).\n\nIn India, the earliest country in which fine gemstones were known, belief in luminous gems dates back some twenty-five centuries. The c. 700 BCE-300 CE ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'' states that [[Vishnu]], in his avatar as the many-headed snake [[Shesha]] under the name [[wikt:Ananta|Ananta]] (\"Endless\"), \"has a thousand heads adorned with the mystical Swastika and in each head a jewel to give light\" (Ball 1938: 498). The c. 400 BCE-300 CE Hindu classic ''[[Mahabharata]]'' tells the story of the five [[Pandava]] brothers and the raja [[Babruvahana]]'s palace with its precious stones that \"shone like lamps so that there was no need for any other light in the assembly.\" In the c. 100 CE ''[[Buddhacarita]]'', the city of [[Kapila]] is said to have gems so bright \"that darkness like poverty could find no place.\" (Ball 1938: 499).\n\nIn [[Classical antiquity]], the Greek historian [[Herodotus]] (c. 484-425 BCE) was the first European to describe luminous gems. The temple of [[Heracles]] at [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] had two great columns, one of gold, the other of ''smaragdos'' ({{linktext| \u03c3\u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2}}, \"green gems including emerald\") that \"shone brightly at night\" (Harvey 1957: 33, suggesting the phosphorescent \"false emerald\" type of [[fluorspar]]). Ball says that the \"wily priests doubtless enclosed a lamp in hollow green glass, to mislead the credulous\". The [[Pseudo-Plutarch]] \"On Rivers\", probably written by the Greek grammarian [[Parthenius of Nicaea]] (d. 14 CE), states that in the [[Sakarya River]] the ''Aster'' ({{linktext|\u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1}}, \"star\") gem is found, \"which flames in the dark\", and thus called ''Ballen'' (the \"King\") in the [[Phrygian language]] (King 1867: 9). The Roman author [[Pliny the Elder]] (23\u201379 CE) described the ''chrysolampis'' as an eastern gem, \"pale by day but of a fiery luster by night\" (Ball 1938: 499). The Syrian rhetorician [[Lucian]] (c. 125-180 CE) describes a statue of the Syrian goddess [[Atargatis]] in [[Hierapolis Bambyce]] (present-day [[Manbij]]) with a gem on her head called Greek ''[[wikt:lychnus|lychnis]]'' ({{linktext|\u03bb\u03cd\u03c7\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2}}, \"lamp; light\") (Schafer 1963: 237). \"From this stone flashes a great light in the night-time, so that the whole temple gleams brightly as by the light of myriads of candles, but in the daytime the brightness grows faint; the gem has the likeness of a bright fire.\" (tr. Strong and Garstang 1913: 72). According to Pliny, the stone is called ''lychnis'' because its luster is heightened by the light of a lamp, when its tints are particularly pleasing (Laufer 1915: 58).\n\nAlthough early Chinese classics from the [[Eastern Zhou dynasty]] (770\u2013256 BCE) refer to luminous gems (e.g., \"the Marquis of Sui's pearl\" discussed below under grateful animals), [[Sima Qian]]'s c. 94 BCE [[Han dynasty]] ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' has two early references to using them as a source of light. Most [[Chinese language|Chinese]] names for shining pearls/gems are [[Compound (linguistics)|compounds]] of ''zh\u016b'' ([[wikt:\u73e0|\u73e0]], \"pearl; gem; bead; orb\"), such as ''y\u00e8m\u00edngzh\u016b'' (\u591c\u660e\u73e0, \"night luminous pearl\"), ''m\u00edngyu\u00e8zh\u016b'' (\u660e\u6708\u73e0, \"luminous moon pearl\"), and ''y\u00e8gu\u0101ngzh\u016b'' (\u591c\u5149\u73e0, \"night shining pearl\"). The \"House of [[Duke Tai of Tian Qi|Tian Jingzhong]]\" history records that in 379 BCE, [[King Wei of Qi]] boasted to [[King Hui of Wei]], \"Even a state as small as mine still has ten pearls one inch in diameter that cast radiance over twelve carriages in front and behind them.\" (tr. Sawyer 2018: n.p.). In the biography of the Han court minister Zou Yang (\u9112\u967d, fl. 150 BCE), he figuratively uses the terms ''mingyue zhi zhu'' (\u660e\u6708\u4e4b\u73e0, \"luminous moon pearl\") and ''yeguang zhi bi'' (\u591c\u5149\u4e4b\u58c1, \"night shining [[Bi (jade)|jade-disk]]\") to illustrate how talented people are lost for lack of recommendations, \"If I were to throw a luminous moon pearl or a night shining jade-disk on a dark road in front of someone, who would not grasp their sword and look startled?\" The German sinologist [[August Conrady]] suggested that the Chinese names ''mingyuezhizhu'' and ''yeguangzhu'' may have an Indian origin, with analogs in the ''chandra-k\u00e2nta'' (\"moon-beloved\") gem that contains condensed moonlight and the ''harinma\u1e47i'' (\"moon-jewel\") name for emerald (1931: 168-169). \n\n[[File:Qing Dynasty Dish with dragons.jpg|thumb|[[Qing dynasty]] plate with two dragons and a flaming pearl]]\n[[Li Shizhen]]'s 1578 ''[[Bencao Gangmu]]'' pharmacopeia describes ''leizhu'' (\u96f7\u73e0, \"thunder pearls/beads\") that the divine dragon ''[[shenlong]]'' \"held in its mouth and dropped. They light the entire house at night\" (tr. Laufer 1912: 64). [[Chinese dragon]]s are frequently depicted with a [[Eight Treasures|flaming pearl]] or gem under their chin or in their claws. According to the German anthropologist [[Wolfram Eberhard]], the ''long'' dragon is a symbol of clouds and rainstorms, and when it plays with a ball or pearl, this signifies the swallowing of the moon by the clouds or thunder in the clouds. The moon frequently appears as a pearl, and thus the dragon with the pearl is equal to the clouds with the moon. The pearl-moon relationship is expressed in the Chinese belief that at full moon pearls are solid balls and at new moon they are hollow. (1968: 239, 382).\n\nThe [[Talmudic]] c. 350-500 CE ''[[Gemara]]'' has several references to luminous gems. For example, [[Abraham]] was allegedly so jealous of his many wives that he incarcerated them in a city of iron with walls so high that neither the sun nor moon could be seen. However, he \"provided a great bowl filled with jewels which lighted up the whole building\" (Ball 1938: 499).\n\nThe best documented of the illumination tales is that of the [[King of Ceylon]]'s luminous carbuncle or ruby, first mentioned by the Greek traveler [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]] in the 6th century and thereafter described by many travelers, the latest of the 17th century. According to Indicopleustes, it was \"as large as a great pine-cone, fiery red, and when seen flashing from a distance, especially if the sun's rays are playing around it, being a matchless sight\" (Laufer 1915: 62). The Chinese Buddhist pilgrim [[Xuanzang]]'s 646 ''[[Great Tang Records on the Western Regions]]'' locates it in the Buddha Tooth Temple near [[Anuradhapura]], \"Its magical brilliance illumines the whole heaven. In the calm of a clear and cloudless night it can be seen by all, even at a distance of a myriad ''[[Li (unit)|li]]''.\" The Song Scholar [[Zhao Rukuo]]'s c. 1225 ''[[Zhu Fan Zhi]]'' (\"Records of Foreign People\") says, \"The king holds in his hand a jewel five inches in diameter, which cannot be burnt by fire, and which shines in (the darkness of) night like a torch. The king rubs his face with it daily, and though he were passed ninety he would retain his youthful looks.\" (Hirth and Rockhill 1911: 73). Based on this incombustibility, Laufer says this night-shining jewel was probably a diamond (1915: 63). Others state that it \"serves instead of a lamp at night\", has \"the appearance of a glowing fire\", or of that \"of a great flame of fire.\" Due to its luminescence, [[Marco Polo]] called it \"The Red Palace Illuminator\" (Ball 1938: 499).\n\nThe English alchemist John Norton wrote a 1470 poem entitled \"Ordinal, or a manual of the chemical art\", in which he proposed erecting a gold bridge over the [[River Thames]] and illuminating it with carbuncles set on golden pinnacles, \"A glorious thing for men to beholde\" ([[Elias Ashmole|Ashmole]] 1652: 27).\n\nBoats lit by luminous gems are a variant of the illumination idea. There is an old rabbinical tradition that \"[[Noah]] had a luminous stone in the [[Noah's Ark|Ark]] that \"shone more brightly by night than by day, thus serving to distinguish day and night when the sun and moon were shrouded by dense clouds.\" (Harvey 1957: 15). The Mormon ''[[Book of Ether]]'' describes \"sixteen small stones; and they were white and clear, even as transparent glass\", being touched by God's hand so that they might \"shine forth in darkness.\" The [[Jaredites]] placed a stone fore and aft on each ship and had \"light continually\" during their 344-day voyage to America (Ball 1938: 500).\n\nThe theme of luminous gems guiding mariners and others originated in Europe in the Middle Ages. The earliest is probably the [[Scandinavian saga]] of the [[Visby]] garnets. In the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] city Visby, on the island of [[Gotland]], the Church of St. Nicholas had two [[rose window]]s with huge garnets in the center, overlooking the [[Baltic Sea]]. Sagas say the two gems shone at night as brightly as did the sun at noon and guided mariners safely to port. In 1361 King [[Valdemar IV]] of Denmark conquered Gotland, but his rich booty, including the marvelous garnets, sank in the ocean when the king's ship was wrecked on the [[Kong Karls Land]] islands (Ball 1938: 500). \n\nThe [[Relic#Christianity|relic]] of the [[Virgin Mary]]'s wedding ring, which according to different accounts had an onyx, amethyst, or green jasper, was supposedly brought back from the [[Holy Land]] in 996 CE. It was placed in the Church of [[Santa Mustiola]], [[Clusium]] (modern [[Chiusi]]), Italy, and in 1473 the ring was transferred to the Franciscan monastery in that city. One of the monks stole it and fled into the night, but when he repented and promised to return it, the ring emitted a bright light by which he traveled to [[Perugia]]. The two cities fought fiercely for the possession of this sacred ring, but in 1486 the Vatican decreed the relic should be placed in the [[Perugia Cathedral]] (Ball 1938: 500). \n\nThe Dutch scholar [[Alardus of Amsterdam]] (1491\u20131544) relates the history of a luminous \"chrysolampis\" (\u03c7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03b9\u03c2, \"gold-gleaming\") gem set on a golden tablet with other valuable gemstones. Around 975, Hildegard, wife of [[Dirk II, Count of Holland]], dedicated the tablet to Saint [[Adalbert of Egmond]] and presented it to [[Egmond Abbey]], where the saint's body reposed. Alardus tells us that the \"chrysolampis\" \"shone so brightly that when the monks were called to the chapel in the nighttime, they could read the [[Book of hours|Hours]] without any other light,\" however this brilliant gem was stolen by one of the monks and thrown into the sea (Kunz 1913: 164).\n\nThe French chemist [[Marcellin Berthelot]] (1888) discovered an early Greek alchemical text \"from the sanctuary of the temple\" that says the Egyptians produced \"the carbuncle that shines in the night\" from certain phosphorescent parts (\"the bile\") of marine animals, and when properly prepared these precious gems would glow so brightly at night \"that anyone owning such a stone could read or write by its light as well as he could by daylight.\" (Kunz 1913: 173).\n\n===Gem mining legends===\n[[File:Forsterite-Olivine-tmu14a.jpg|thumb|[[Peridot]] from [[Zabargad Island]]]]\n[[File:Scheelite sous U.V. (Chine) .jpg|thumb|[[Scheelite]] under [[ultraviolet]] light]]\n[[File:Willemite-Calcite-225254.jpg|thumb|[[Willemite]] under ultraviolet light]]\nSecond, there are stories about miners finding luminous gems at night and extracting them by day (Ball 1938: 500-501). One notable exception is Pliny's c. 77 CE ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' that describes finding carbuncles in the daytime, some kinds \"doe glitter and shine of their owne nature: by reason whereof, they are discovered soone wheresoever they lie, by the reverberation of the Sun-beams\" (Harvey 1957: 34).\n\nIn the 1st century BCE, the Greek historians [[Diodorus Siculus]] (c. 90-30) and [[Strabo]] (c. 63-24) both record the [[peridot]] (gem-quality [[olivine]]) mine of Egyptian king [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] (r. 285\u2013246 BCE) on the barren, forbidden island of Ophiodes ({{linktext|\u1f48\u03c6\u03b9\u03ce\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2|\u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2}}, \"Snakey\") or Topazios ({{linktext|\u03a4\u03bf\u03c0\u03ac\u03b6\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2}}, \"Topaz\"), modern [[Zabargad Island]], off the ancient [[Red Sea]] port [[Berenice Troglodytica]].\nDiodorus says Philadelphus exterminated the \"divers sorts of dreadful Serpents\" that formerly infested on the island on account of the \"Topaz, a resplendent Stone, of a delightful Aspect, like to Glass, of a Golden colour, and of admirable brightness; and therefore all were forbidden to set footing upon that Place; and if any landed there, he was presently put to death by the Keepers of the Island.\" The Egyptian mining technique relied upon luminosity. \"This Stone grows in the Rocks, darken'd by the brightness of the Sun; it's not seen in the Day, but shines bright and glorious in the darkest Night, and discovers it self at a great distance. The Keepers of the Island disperse themselves into several Places to search for this stone, and wherever it appears, they mark the Place, with a great Vessel of largeness sufficient to cover the sparkling Stone; and then in the Day time, go to the Place, and cut out the Stone, and deliver it to those that are Artists in polishing of 'em.\" (tr. Oldfather et al. 1814 3: 36). According to Strabo, \"The topaz is a transparent stone sparkling with a golden lustre, which, however, is not easy to be distinguished in the day-time, on account of the brightness of the surrounding light, but at night the stones are visible to those who collect them. The collectors place a vessel over the spot [where the topazes are seen] as a mark, and dig them up in the day.\" (tr. Hamilton and Falconer 1889 3:103). Ball notes that the legendary \"topaz\" of Topazios island is olivine, which is not luminescent while true topaz is, and suggests, \"This tale may well have been told to travelers by astute Egyptian gem merchants anxious to enhance the value of their wares by exaggerating the dangers inherent to procuring the olivines.\" (1938: 500). In the present day, the island mine is now submerged underwater and inaccessible.\n\nThe theme of locating luminous gems at night is found in other sources. The c. 125 CE didactic Christian text ''[[Physiologus]]'' states that the diamond (\"carbuncle\") is not to be found in the day but only at night, which may imply that it emits light (Laufer 1915:62). The Anglo-Indian diplomat [[Thomas Douglas Forsyth]] says that in 632, the ancient Iranian [[Saka]] Buddhist [[Kingdom of Khotan]] sent a \"splendid jade stone\" as tribute to [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]]. Khotan's rivers were famous for their jade, \"which was discovered by its shining in the water at night\", and divers would procure it in shallow waters after the snowmelt floods had subsided (1875: 113). The [[Bohemian]] rabbi [[Petachiah of Regensburg]] (d. c. 1225) adapted Strabo's story for the gold he saw in the land of Ishmael, east of [[Nineveh]], where \"the gold grows like herbs. In the night its brightness is seen when a mark is made with dust or lime. They then come in the morning and gather the herbs upon which the gold is found.\" (tr. Benisch and Ainsworth 1856: 51, 53).\n\nA modern parallel to ancient miners seeking luminous gems at nighttime is mineworkers using portable [[Ultraviolet#Short-wave ultraviolet lamps|shortwave ultraviolet lamps]] to locate ores that respond with color-specific fluorescence. For instance, under short-wave UV light, [[scheelite]], a [[tungsten]] ore, fluoresces a bright sky-blue, and [[willemite]], a minor ore of [[zinc]], fluoresces green (Ball 1938: 501). \n\n===Animal legends===\nThe third luminous-gem theme involves serpents (of Hindu origin), or small animals (Spanish), with gems in their heads, or grateful animals repaying human kindness (Chinese and Roman) (Ball 1938: 501-505).\n\nLegends about snakes that carry a marvelous jewel either in their forehead or in their mouth are found almost worldwide. Scholars have suggested that the myth may have originated with [[snake worship]], or light reflected by a serpent's eye, or the flame color of certain snakes' lips. In only a relative few of these legends is the stone luminous, this variant being known in India, Ceylon, ancient Greece, Armenia, and among Cherokee Indians (Ball 1938: 502).\n\nThe Hindu polymath [[Var\u0101hamihira]]'s 6th century ''Brhat Samhit'' encyclopedic work describes the bright star [[Canopus]], named Agastya ([[wikt:\u0905\u0917\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u092f|\u0905\u0917\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u092f]]) in Sanskrit, also the name of the [[Rishis|rishi]] [[Agastya]], \"Its huge white waves looked like clouds; its gems looked like stars; its crystals looked like the Moon; and its long bright serpents bearing gems in their hoods looked like comets and thus the whole sea looked like the sky.\" Another context says black glossy pearls are also produced in the heads of serpents related to the [[n\u0101gar\u0101ja]] ([[wikt:\u0928\u093e\u0917\u0930\u093e\u091c|\u0928\u093e\u0917\u0930\u093e\u091c]], \"dragon kings\") [[Takshaka]] and [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]] (tr. Iyer 1884: 77, 179).\n\nThe \"Snake Jewel\" story in Somadeva's 11th-century ''[[Kathasaritsagara]]'' (\"Ocean of the Streams of Stories\") refers to a ''[[wikt:ma\u1e47i|ma\u1e47i]]'' ([[wikt:\u092e\u0923\u093f#Sanskrit| \u092e\u0923\u093f]], \"gem; jewel; pearl\") on a snake's head. When the Hindu mythological king [[Nala]] is fleeing from a jungle wildfire, he hears a voice asking for help and turns back to see a snake \"having his head encircled with the rays of the jewels of his crest\", who, after being rescued reveals himself to be the n\u0101gar\u0101ja [[Karkotaka]] (tr. Tawney 1928 4: 245).\n\nThe 3rd-century CE ''[[Life of Apollonius of Tyana]]'', the Greek [[sophist]] [[Philostratus]]'s biography of [[Apollonius of Tyana]] (c. 3 BCE-97 CE), says that in India, people will kill a mountain dragon and cut off its head, in which, \"are stones of rich lustre, emitting every-coloured rays and of occult virtue.\" It also mentions a myth that cranes will not build their nests until they have affixed a \"light-stone\" (Ancient Greek ''[[wikt:lychnidis|lychnidis]]'', \"shining\") to help the eggs hatch and to drive away snakes (tr. [[Frederick Cornwallis Conybeare|Conybeare]] 1912: 103, 155).\n\nIn the [[Bengal]]i tale of \"[[The Twelve Dancing Princesses#Variants|The Rose of Bak\u00e1wal\u00ed]]\", the heroic prince Jamila Khatun encounters a monstrous dragon that carried in its mouth \"a serpent which emitted a gem so brilliant that it lighted up the jungle for many miles\". His plan to obtain it was to throw a heavy lump of clay on the luminous gem, plunging the jungle into darkness, \"so that the dragon and the serpent knocked their heads against the stones and died.\" (tr. [[William Alexander Clouston|Clouston]] 1889: 296-297).\n\nAccording to [[Armenia]]n \"The Queen of the Serpents\" legend, the serpents of [[Mount Ararat]] select a queen who destroys invading armies of foreign serpents, and carries in her mouth a \"wonderful stone, the Hul, or stone of light, which upon certain nights she tosses in the air, when it shines as the sun. Happy the man who shall catch the stone ere it falls.\" ([[August von Haxthausen|von Haxthausen]] 1854: 355).\n\n[[Henry Timberlake]], the British emissary to the [[Overhill Cherokee]] during the 1761-1762 [[Timberlake Expedition]], records a story about [[medicine men]] (\"conjurers\") using gemstones, which is a variant of the [[Horned Serpent]] legend in [[Iroquois mythology]]. One luminous gem \"remarkable for its brilliancy and beauty\" supposedly \"grew on the head of a mon\u0283trous \u0283erpent\" that was guarded by many snakes. The medicine man hid this luminous gemstone, and no one else had seen it. Timberlake supposed he had \"hatched the account of its difcovery\" (1765: 48-49). Ball doubts the myth and suggests \"European influence\" (1938: 503).\n\nThe [[Catalonia|Catalan]] missionary [[Jordanus]]'s c. 1330 ''[[Jordanus#Mirabilia|Mirabilia]]'' says he heard that the dragons of India Tertia (Eastern African, south of Abyssinia) have on their heads \"the lustrous stones which we call carbuncles.\" When they become too large to fly, they fall and die in a \"certain river which issues from Paradise\". After seventy days the people recover the \"carbuncle which is rooted in the top of his head\" and take it to [[Prester John]], the Emperor of the Ethiopians (tr. [[Henry Yule|Yule]] 1863: 42)\n\nAfter his third visit to Persia in 1686, the French jeweler and traveler [[John Chardin]] wrote that the Egyptian carbuncle was \"very probably only an Oriental Ruby of higher Colour than usual.\" The Persians call it ''Icheb Chirac'', the Flambeau [\"burning torch\"] of the Night because of the property and Quality it has of enlightening all things round it\", and \"They tell you that the Carbuncle was bred within the Head of a Dragon, a Griffin, or a Royal Eagle, which was found upon the Mountain of Caf.\" (Chardin 2010: 166-167)\n\nLike Chardin's griffin or eagle, some stories about luminous gems involve animals other than snakes and dragons. An early example is the 3rd-century CE Greek Pseudo-Callisthenes ''[[Alexander romance|Romance of Alexander]]'' that says [[Alexander the Great]] once speared a fish, \"in whose bowels was found a white stone so brilliant that everyone believed it was a lamp. Alexander set it in gold, and used it as a lamp at night.\" (Laufer 1915: 58). \n\nSydney H. Ball recounts the widespread variation of the animal-gratitude snake story involving a wild animal (often called ''carbuncle'', Spanish ''[[wikt:carbunclo|carbunclo]]'', or Latin ''[[wikt:carbunculo|carbunculo]]'') with a luminous gem on its head, and which Europeans apparently introduced into Africa and America.\n\nIn 1565, Don John Bermudez, ambassador of [[Prester John]] to [[John III of Portugal]], described an Upper [[Nile]] snake called \"Of the shadow, or Canopie, because it hath a skinne on the head wherewith it covereth a very precious stone, which they say it hath in her head.\" ([[Samuel Purchas|Purchas]] 1625 2: 1169). \n\nThe English merchant [[William Finch (merchant)|William Finch]] reported around 1608 a [[Sierra Leone]] story about a wolf-like creature with a luminous gem. \"The Negros told us of a strange beast (which the interpreter called a Carbuncle) oft seene yet only by night, having a stone in his forehead, incredibly shining and giving him light to feed, attentive to the least noyse, which he no sooner heareth, but he presently covereth the same with a filme or skinne given him as a naturall covering that his splendour betray him not.\" ([[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] 1857: 124).\n\nIn 1666, another version of the theme is a huge snake recorded from [[Island Caribs]] on the island of [[Dominica]], [[West Indies]]. \"On its head was a very sparkling stone, like a Carbuncle, of inestimable price: That it commonly veil'd that rich Jewel with a thin moving skin, like that of a man's eye-lid: but that when it went to drink or sported himself in the midst of that deep bottom, he fully discover'd it, and that the rocks and all about receiv'd a wonderful lustre from the fire issuing out of that precious crown.\" (de Rochefort 1666: 15).\n\nAccording to the Swiss explorer [[Johann Jakob von Tschudi]], in the highlands of [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]], the native peoples tell stories of a fabulous beast with a luminous gem. \"The carbunculo is represented to be of the size of a fox, with long black hair, and is only visible at night, when it slinks slowly through the thickets. If followed, he opens a flap or valve in the forehead, from under which an extraordinary, brilliant, and dazzling light issues. The natives believe that this light proceeds from a brilliant precious stone, and that any fool hardy person who may venture to grasp at it rashly is blinded; then the flap is let down, and the animal disappears in the darkness.\" ([[Johann Jakob von Tschudi|von Tschudi]] 1854: 320). The American archeologist [[Adolph Francis Alphonse Bandelier]] cites von Tschudi and describes the carbunculo as a cat with a blood-red jewel, which is supposed to dwell on [[Nevado Sajama]] mountain, near [[Oruro Department|Oruro]], [[Bolivia]]. Bandelier believes his Bolivian informants that the carbunculo has existed from the earliest times, and \"certainly before the conquest, so that its introduction cannot be attributed to the Spaniards\" (1910: 320). Nevertheless, based upon how closely the above American versions of the myth follow the pattern of the European form, Ball concludes that the Spaniards introduced the carbuncle myth (1938: 504).\n\nIn contrast to the above legends about people killing snakes and animals in order to obtain their luminous gems, another group of legends has a theme of injured animals presenting magical gems out of gratitude to people who helped them. This is a subcategory of [[Aarne\u2013Thompson classification systems#Use in folkloristics|The Grateful Animals]] folktale motif ([[Aarne\u2013Thompson classification systems]] 554), for example, [[The White Snake]] or [[The Queen Bee]]. \n\nThese animal-gratitude stories are first recorded around two millennia ago in China and Rome. Based upon striking coincidences in Chinese and Roman versions of the story, Laufer reasoned that there was an obvious historical connection (1915: 59-60), and Ball believes these tales probably originated independently (1938: 504).\n\n[[File:Bi with two dragons and grain pattern.jpg|thumb|[[ Bi (jade)|Bi]] jade-disk with a dual dragon motif, [[Warring States period]]]]\nThe earliest known story about a grateful animal with a luminous gem is the Chinese ''Suihouzhu'' (\u96a8\u4faf\u73e0, \"the Marquis of Sui's pearl\") legend that a year after he saved the life of a wounded snake, it returned and gave him a fabulous pearl that emitted a light as bright as that of the moon (Ball 1938: 504). [[Sui (state)|Sui]] (\u96a8, cf. \u968b [[Sui dynasty]]), located in present-day [[Suizhou]], [[Hubei]], was a lesser feudal state during the [[Zhou dynasty]] (c.\u20091046 BC\u2013256 BCE) and a [[State (Ancient China)|vassal state]] of [[Chu (state)|Chu]]. Several [[Warring States period]] (c. 475-221 BCE) texts mention Marquis Sui's pearl as a metaphor for something important or valuable, but without explaining the grateful snake tale, which implies that it was common knowledge among contemporary readers.\n\nThe [[Marquis of Sui's pearl]] is mentioned in the ''[[Zhan Guo Ce|Zhanguo ci]]'' (\"Strategies of the Warring States\") compendium of political and military anecdotes dating from 490 to 221 BCE. [[King Wuling of Zhao]] (r. 325\u2013299 BCE) summoned Zheng Tong (\u912d\u540c) for an audience and asked how to avoid warfare with neighboring feudal states. Zheng Tong replied, 'Well, let us suppose there is a man who carries with him the pearl of Sui-hou and the Ch'ih-ch'iu armband [\u6301\u4e18\u4e4b\u74b0, uncertain] as well as goods valued at ten thousand in gold. Now he stops the night in an uninhabited place.\" Since he has neither weapons nor protectors, \"It is clear he will not spend more than a night abroad before someone harms him. At the moment there are powerful and greedy states on your majesty's borders and they covet your land. \u2026 If you lack weapons your neighbours, of course, will be quite satisfied.\" (tr. Crump 1970: 327).\n\nThe c. 3rd-1st centuries BCE Daoist ''[[Zhuangzi (book)]]'' alludes to the marquis's pearl. \"Whenever the sage makes a movement, he is certain to examine what his purpose is and what he is doing. If now, however, we suppose that there were a man who shot at a sparrow a thousand yards away with the pearl of the Marquis of Sui, the world would certainly laugh at him. Why is this? It is because what he uses is important and what he wants is insignificant. And is not life much more important than the pearl of the Marquis of Sui?\" (tr. Mair 1994: 288).\n\nSeveral [[Chinese classics]] pair the legendary ''Suihouzhu'' (\"the Marquis of Sui's pearl\") with another priceless gem, the ''Heshibi'' (\u548c\u6c0f\u74a7, \"[[Mr. He's jade]]\"). The ''[[Bi (jade)|bi]]'' is a type of circular [[Chinese jade]] artifact, and \"Mr. He\" was Bian He (\u535e\u548c), who found a marvelous piece of raw jade that went cruelly unrecognized by successive Chu monarchs until it was finally acknowledged as a priceless jewel. The c. 3rd-1st century BCE ''[[Chuci]]'' (\"Songs of [[Chu (state)|Chu]]\") mentions the paired gems, \"Shards and stones are prized as jewels / Sui and He rejected\". This poetic anthology also says, \"It grieves me that shining pearls [\u660e\u73e0] should be cast out in the mire / While worthless fish-eye stones are treasured in a strong-box\", and describes a flying chariot, \"Fringed with the dusky Moon Bright pearls [\u660e\u6708\u4e4b\u7384\u73e0]\" (tr. Hawkes 1985: 277, 295, 290). King [[Liu An]]'s c. 139 BCE ''[[Huainanzi]]'' (\"Philosophers of Huainan\") uses the story to describe one who has attained the Way of Heaven ([[wikt:\u5929\u9053|\u5929\u9053]]), \"It is like the pearl of Marquis Sui or the jade disk of Mr. He. Those who achieved it became rich; those who lost it became poor.\" (tr. Major et al. 2010: 218).\n\nThe c. 222 CE ''[[Claudius Aelianus#De Natura Animalium|De Natura Animalium]]'' (\"On the Characteristics of Animals\"), compiled by Roman author [[Claudius Aelianus]], told the story of Heraclea or Herakleis, a virtuous widow of [[Taranto|Tarentum]], who after seeing a fledgling stork fall and break its leg, nursed it back to health, and set it free. One year later, as Heraclea sat at the door of her cottage, the young stork returned and dropped a precious stone into her lap, and she put it indoors. Awakening that night, she saw that the gem \"diffused a brightness and a gleam, and the house was lit up as though a torch had been brought in, so strong a radiance came from, and was engendered by, the lump of stone.\" (tr. [[A. F. Scholfield|Scholfield]] 1959: 209-210).\n\nLaufer cites three c. 4th-century Chinese grateful-animal stories that parallel Heraclea's stork. The ''[[Shi Yi Ji|Shiyi ji]]'' (\"Researches into Lost Records\"), compiled by the Daoist scholar [[Wang Jia]] (d. 390 CE) from early apocryphal versions of Chinese history, recounts an anecdote about King Zhao of [[Yan (state)|Yan]] (\u71d5\u662d\u738b, r. 311\u2013279 BCE) and grateful birds with ''dongguangzhu'' (\u6d1e\u5149\u73e0, \"cave shining pearls\"). \n<blockquote>When Prince Chao of Yen was once seated on a terrace, black birds with white heads flocked there together, holding in their beaks perfectly resplendent pearls, measuring one foot all round. These pearls were black as lacquer, and emitted light in the interior of a house to such a degree that even the spirits could not obscure their supernatural essence.\" (tr. Laufer 1915: 59). </blockquote>\nThe imperial historian [[Gan Bao]]'s c. 350 CE ''[[Soushen Ji]]'' (\"In Search of the Supernatural\") has two grateful-animal stories involving luminous pearls/gems. The first involves a black crane; according to legend, when a crane has lived a thousand years it turns blue; after another thousand it becomes black and is called a ''xuanhe'' (\u7384\u9db4. \"dark crane\").\n<blockquote>Kuai Shen [\u5672\u53c3] was the most filial son to his mother. Once a black crane was injured by a bow hunter and in its extremity, went to Kuai. The latter took it in, doctored its wound, and when it was cured set it free. Soon afterwards the crane showed up again outside Kuai's door. The latter shone a torch to see out and discovered its mate there too. Each of them held a single night-glowing pearl [\u660e\u73e0] in its beak to repay Kuai. (tr. DeWoskin and Crump 1996: 238). </blockquote>\nThe second story is oldest detailed explanation of Marquis of Sui's pearl.\n<blockquote>Once upon a time, when the ruler of the old Sui kingdom was journeying, he came upon a great wounded serpent whose back was broken. The ruler believed the creature to be a spirit manifestation and ordered his physician to treat it with drugs to close up its wound. Thereafter the serpent was able to move again, and the place was called Mound of the Wounded Serpent. One year later the serpent brought a bright pearl [\u660e\u73e0] in its mouth to give the ruler of Sui to show its gratitude. The pearl was greater than an inch in diameter, of the purest white and emitted light like moonglow. In the dark it could illuminate an entire room. For these reasons it was known as \"Duke Sui's Pearl\" [\u968b\u4faf\u73e0] or the \"Spirit Snake's Pearl\" [\u9748\u86c7\u73e0], or, again, the \"Moonlight Pearl\" [\u660e\u6708\u73e0]. (tr. DeWoskin and Crump 1996: 239). </blockquote>\nLaufer concludes that the \"coincidences in these three Chinese versions and the story of the Greek author, even in unimportant details such as the thankful bird returning after one year to the marquis of Sui, are so striking, that an historical connection between the two is obvious.\" (1915: 60).\n\nA later elaboration of animal-gratitude stories involves grateful animals and ungrateful people, who are typically rescued from a [[pitfall trap]] (Ashliman 2010). Two versions mention marvelous gems. The English historian [[Matthew Paris]]'s c. 1195 ''Chronicles'' says that [[Richard I of England]] (1157-1199) used to tell a parable about ungrateful people. A Venetian, Vitalis, was rescued from a horrible death by a ladder being let down into a pit into which he had fallen. A lion and a serpent trapped in the same pit used his ladder to escape, and the lion in gratitude brought to Vitalis a goat he had killed and the snake a luminous jewel that he carried in his mouth. As Richard reportedly told the story after his return from the [[Crusades]] he may have heard it in the East, as similar stories, but without the stone being luminous, occur in two Indian collections, the c. 300 BCE ''[[Panchatantra|Kalila wa Dimnah]]'' and the 11th-century ''[[Kathasaritsagara]]'' (Ball 1938: 505). The English poet [[John Gower]]'s 1390 ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' tells the story of the rich Roman lord Adrian and the poor [[Firewood|woodcutter]] Bardus. Adrian falls into a pit that had already captured an ape and a serpent, and promises to give half his wealth to Bardus for pulling him out. After Bardus rescues the three, out of gratitude the ape piled up firewood for him and the serpent gave him \"a stone more bright than cristall out of his mouth\", but Adrian refuses to pay his debt. Bardus sells the luminous gem for gold and afterwards found it again in his purse, and the same thing happened every time he sold it. Emperor [[Justinian I]] summons Bardus, listens to his testimony supported by the magically reappearing gem, and compels Adrian to fulfill his promise (tr. [[William Alexander Clouston|Clouston]] 1887 1: 224-226).\n\nSome scholars were skeptical about luminous gem stories. In the West, the earliest nonbeliever was the Portuguese traveler to India and gem expert, [[Garcia de Orta]] (1563), who, having been told by a jeweler of a luminous carbuncle, doubted its existence. In the East, the first recorded skeptic was the Chinese encyclopedist [[Song Yingxing]], who in 1628 wrote \"it is not true that there are pearls emitting light at the hour of the dusk or night.\" (Ball 1938: 505).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cintamani]], a wish-fulfilling jewel in Hindu and Buddhist traditions \n*[[Mani Jewel]], various legendary jewels mentioned in Buddhist texts\n*[[Indra's net]], Buddhist metaphor of a vast net with a jewel or pearl at each knot, infinitely reflecting all the other jewels\n\n==References== \n*Ashliman, D.

The class was originally planned to consist of thirteen vessels, but due to the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], as well as budgetary limitations, the orders for the last four were cancelled in 1922, with the final number being reduced to eight when ''No.14'' was also cancelled. The ''Wakatake'' class was the last class to be rated \"second class\" and all future destroyers were designed larger.<ref>Globalsecurity.org, IJN Wakatake class destroyers</ref> It was planned that the ''Wakatake''-class ships should have names, but upon completion they were given numbers. This proved to be extremely unpopular with the crews and was a constant source of confusion in communications, so in 1928, names were assigned.<ref>Howarth, ''The Fighting Ships of the Rising Sun''</ref>\n\n==Design==\nThe ''Wakatake''-class destroyers were essentially slightly modified ''Momi''-class ships with 50 tons additional displacement and a deeper draft to improve handling characteristics in heavy seas, particularly against rolling. Weaponry layout (with the exception of added AA armaments), general arrangement and silhouette were all identical with the ''Momi'' class.\n\nAs with the ''Momi'' class, a number of types of [[turbine engine]]s were used for propulsion. ''Asagao'' was built with [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] impulse turbines, ''Y\u016bgao'' with [[Escher Wyss & Cie]] Zoelly turbines, and the remaining vessels with [[John Brown & Company|Brown-Curtis]] turbines.\n\nThe armament for the ''Wakatake''-class was identical to that of the ''Momi'' class. The [[main battery]] consisted of three [[Type 3 120 mm 45 caliber naval gun]]s in single mounts, with two twin Type 6 torpedo launchers. Anti-aircraft protection was provided by two 7.7mm machine guns. After the start of the [[Pacific War]], one of the Type 3 guns was replaced by two triple-mount [[Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Gun|Type 96]] 25-mm cannons, although some vessels had three twin-mounts and two single-mounts instead. The minesweeping gear was replaced by 36 to 48 [[depth charge]]s with four launchers. Some of the vessels also were fitted with a Type 13 radar.<ref name=\"Stille\">{{cite book |last1=Stille |first1=Mark |title=Imperial Japanese Navy Antisubmarine Escorts 1941\u201345 |date=2017 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |location=Oxford, UK |isbn=978 1 4728 1817 1 |pages=14\u201317}}</ref>\n\n==Operational history==\nThe small displacement of the ''Wakatake''-class limited their utility as fleet escorts, and as with the ''Momi''-class, they were mainly used in Chinese coastal waters, where their shallow draft made them suitable for operations in rivers and coastal waters.<ref name=\"Stille\"/>\n\nOn 15 September 1932, {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Sawarabi||2}} capsized due to poor stability and sank north of [[Keelung]] near [[Taiwan]]. In April 1940 {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Y\u016bgao||2}} was re-rated as ''Patrol Boat No. 46'', with considerably reduced armament and the removal of one boiler, which reduced her speed to only 18 knots.<ref name=\"Stille\"/>\n\nOf the remaining six units, three (''Wakatake'', ''Kuretake'', and ''Sanae'') were assigned to Destroyer Division 13  under the [[Kure Naval District]], and patrolled the [[Seto Inland Sea]] and the [[Bungo Strait]] on [[anti-submarine warfare|antisubmarine patrols]]. The other three (''Asagao'', ''Fuy\u014d'' and ''Karukaya'')were assigned to Destroyer Division 32 under the [[Chinkai Guard District]], which was assigned to patrol the [[Tsushima Strait]] screening maritime traffic in the [[Tsushima Straits]]. From 10 April 1942, the 1st Surface Escort Division of the [[Southwest Area Fleet]] was created, and Desdivs 13 and 32 were assigned to it to provide protection for convoys against [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] submarine activity. The convoy routes were initially those between [[Moji-ku, Kitaky\u016bsh\u016b|Moji]], Taiwan, and the [[Philippines]]. Later, these routes extended to [[Singapore]], [[French Indochina]], the [[Netherlands East Indies]], and [[Palau]]. In the course of this service, {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Karukaya||2}} set a record by successfully completing 54 convoy escorts before her loss. Of the six destroyers, four were lost to American submarines, and one to an air attack.

The class was originally planned to consist of thirteen vessels, but due to the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], as well as budgetary limitations, the orders for the last four were cancelled in 1922, with the final number being reduced to eight when ''No.14'' was also cancelled. The ''Wakatake'' class was the last class to be rated \"second class\" and all future destroyers were designed larger.<ref>Globalsecurity.org, IJN Wakatake class destroyers</ref> It was planned that the ''Wakatake''-class ships should have names, but upon completion they were given numbers. This proved to be extremely unpopular with the crews and was a constant source of confusion in communications, so in 1928, names were assigned.<ref>Howarth, ''The Fighting Ships of the Rising Sun''</ref>\n\n==Design==\nThe ''Wakatake''-class destroyers were essentially slightly modified ''Momi''-class ships with 50 tons additional displacement and a deeper draft to improve handling characteristics in heavy seas, particularly against rolling. Weaponry layout (with the exception of added AA armaments), general arrangement and silhouette were all identical with the ''Momi'' class.\n\nAs with the ''Momi'' class, a number of types of [[turbine engine]]s were used for propulsion. ''Asagao'' was built with [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] impulse turbines, ''Y\u016bgao'' with [[Escher Wyss & Cie]] Zoelly turbines, and the remaining vessels with [[John Brown & Company|Brown-Curtis]] turbines.\n\nThe armament for the ''Wakatake''-class was identical to that of the ''Momi'' class. The [[main battery]] consisted of three [[Type 3 120 mm 45 caliber naval gun]]s in single mounts, with two twin Type 6 torpedo launchers. Anti-aircraft protection was provided by two 7.7mm machine guns. After the start of the [[Pacific War]], one of the Type 3 guns was replaced by two triple-mount [[Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Gun|Type 96]] 25-mm cannons, although some vessels had three twin-mounts and two single-mounts instead. The minesweeping gear was replaced by 36 to 48 [[depth charge]]s with four launchers. Some of the vessels also were fitted with a Type 13 radar.<ref name=\"Stille\">{{cite book |last1=Stille |first1=Mark |title=Imperial Japanese Navy Antisubmarine Escorts 1941\u201345 |date=2017 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |location=Oxford, UK |isbn=978 1 4728 1817 1 |pages=14\u201317}}</ref>\n\n==Operational history==\nThe small displacement of the ''Wakatake''-class limited their utility as fleet escorts, and as with the ''Momi''-class, they were mainly used in Chinese coastal waters, where their shallow draft made them suitable for operations in rivers and coastal waters.<ref name=\"Stille\"/>\n\nOn 15 September 1932, {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Sawarabi||2}} capsized due to poor stability and sank north of [[Keelung]] near [[Taiwan]]. In April 1940 {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Y\u016bgao||2}} was re-rated as ''Patrol Boat No. 46'', with considerably reduced armament and the removal of one boiler, which reduced her speed to only 18 knots.<ref name=\"Stille\"/>\n\nOf the remaining six units, three (''Wakatake'', ''Kuretake'', and ''Sanae'') were assigned to Destroyer Division 13  under the [[Kure Naval District]], and patrolled the [[Seto Inland Sea]] and the [[Bungo Strait]] on [[anti-submarine warfare|antisubmarine patrols]]. The other three (''Asagao'', ''Fuy\u014d'' and ''Karukaya'')were assigned to Destroyer Division 32 under the [[Chinkai Guard District]], which was assigned to patrol the [[Tsushima Strait]] screening maritime traffic in the [[Tsushima Straits]]. From 10 April 1942, the 1st Surface Escort Division of the [[Southwest Area Fleet]] was created, and Desdivs 13 and 32 were assigned to it to provide protection for convoys against [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] submarine activity. The convoy routes were initially those between [[Moji-ku, Kitaky\u016bsh\u016b|Moji]], Taiwan, and the [[Philippines]]. Later, these routes extended to [[Singapore]], [[French Indochina]], the [[Netherlands East Indies]], and [[Palau]]. In the course of this service, {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Karukaya||2}} set a record by successfully completing 54 convoy escorts before her loss. Of the six destroyers, four were lost to American submarines, and one to an air attack.

This proved to be extremely unpopular with the crews and was a constant source of confusion in communications. In August 1928, names were assigned, but not the original names that were planned.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"60%\"\n|width=\"13%\"|'''Plan name and
