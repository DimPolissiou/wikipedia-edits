The battle was fought at the same time as the [[Siege of Calais (1940)|Siege of Calais]], just before [[Operation Dynamo]], the evacuation of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) through [[Dunkirk]]. After the Franco-British counter-attack at the [[Battle of Arras (1940)|Battle of Arras]] on 21 May German units were held ready to resist a resumption of the attack on 22 May, despite the protests of General [[Heinz Guderian]], the commander of XIX Corps, who wanted to rush north up the Channel coast to capture Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk. An attack by part of XIX Corps was not authorised until {{nowrap|12:40 p.m.}} on 22 May, by when the Allied troops at Boulogne had been reinforced from England by most of the [[20th Independent Infantry Brigade (Guards)|20th Guards Brigade]].\n\nThe Guards had time to dig in around the port before the [[2nd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Panzer Division]], which had been delayed by French troops at [[Samer]], attacked the perimeter held by the Irish Guards at around {{nowrap|5:00 p.m.}} and were driven off after an hour of fighting. The Welsh Guards front was attacked at {{nowrap|8:00 p.m.}} and again at dusk before cutting off a party of the Irish at {{nowrap|10:00 p.m.}} At dawn on 23 May, the German attacks resumed, eventually pushing the defenders back into the town. About eighty light bombers of the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) flw in the defence of Boulogne. \n\nRoyal Navy ships shot their way into and out of the harbour and with French navy destroyers, bombarded German positions as wounded and non-combatants were embarked and a navy demolition party landed. During a lull in the afternoon of 23 May, the {{lang|de|[[Luftwaffe]]}} bombed the harbour, despite being intercepted by RAF fighters. At {{nowrap|6:30 p.m.}} the Guards Brigade was ordered to re-embark and the British destroyers ran the gauntlet of German tanks and artillery to evacuate them. The French defenders around the Citadel above the lower town could not be contacted and only in the morning of 24 May did General Lanquetot realise that the British had gone, which led to reproaches.\n\nThe French and remaining British troops held out until 25 May and then surrendered. Guderian wrote that the halt order and then the retention of considerable forces to guard against Allied counter-attacks, had forfeited an opportunity quickly to capture the [[Channel Ports]] and destroy the Allied forces in northern France and Belgium. An advance on Dunkirk began on 23 May but the next day was halted until 27 May; Dunkirk was not captured until 4 June, by when most of the BEF and many French and Belgian troops had escaped.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Boulogne===\n\n{{main|Boulogne-sur-Mer}}\n[[File:C\u00f4te d'Opale topographic map-fr.svg|thumb|{{centre|Map of the {{lang|fr|C\u00f4te d'Opale}}}}]]\nBoulogne-sur-Mer, [[Calais]], [[Dunkirk]] and [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]], are [[Channel Ports]] on the French side at the narrowest part of the English Channel. Boulogne is at the mouth of the fast-flowing [[Liane (river)|Liane]] river, which meanders through a valley. The harbour is on a level area of ground on either side of the river, well built-up and with steep roads uphill to the old town ({{lang|fr|Haute Ville}} or the Citadel). The rolling hills make for hidden approaches to the port and offer commanding high ground to an attacker, particularly the Mont St. Lambert ridge.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=155}} During the [[Phoney War]] {{nowrap|(September 1939 \u2013 10 May 1940)}}, the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) had been supplied through ports further to the west, such as [[Le Havre]] and [[Cherbourg]] but the Channel Ports came into use once mine barrages had been laid  in the [[English Channel]] in late 1939, to reduce the demand for ships and escorts. When leave from the BEF began in December, Boulogne was used for communication and for troop movements.{{sfnm|1a1=Ellis|1y=2004|1p=16|2a1=Bond|2a2=Taylor|2y=2001|2p=130}}\n\n===Battle of France===\n\n{{see also|Order of battle for the Battle of France|British Expeditionary Force order of battle (1940)}}\nOn 10 May 1940, the Germans began {{lang|de|[[Manstein Plan|Fall Gelb]]}} (Case Yellow) the offensive against France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Within a few days, the Germans achieved a breakthrough against the centre of the French front near [[Sedan, France|Sedan]] and drove westwards down the Somme river valley. As the BEF withdrew through Belgium into northern France, fewer supply troops were needed as the lines of communication shortened. The British began to withdraw surplus manpower through Boulogne and Calais and on 17 May, General [[Douglas Brownrigg]], the Adjutant-General of the BEF, moved the Rear General Headquarters (GHQ) from [[Arras]] to Boulogne without informing his French liaison officers.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|pp=188, 190}}{{efn|Relations among Franco-British commanders had been good until the German breakthrough on the Meuse, after which the British staff officers became apprehensive that they might be cut off from the coast, began slighting the liaison officers and withheld information. The French liaison party left Boulogne after a {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}} air raid on the night of {{nowrap|19/20 May}} and reached Abbeville just before the Germans.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|pp=188, 190}}}} The Germans captured [[Abbeville]] at the mouth of the [[Somme River]] on 21 May, cutting off the Allied troops in Northern France and Belgium from their bases south of the river.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=153}}\n\nThe defence of Boulogne was the responsibility of the [[French Navy]] ({{lang|fr|Marine Nationale}}), which manned some 19th-century forts under the command of Commandant Dutfoy de Mont de Benque.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=190}} To protect Boulogne from air attack, eight [[QF 3.7-inch AA gun|3.7-inch anti-aircraft]] guns of the 2nd Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, eight machine-guns of the 58th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment and a battery of the 2nd Searchlight Regiment had arrived from England on 20 May; the French had two {{nowrap|75 mm field}} guns, two {{nowrap|25 mm anti-tank}} guns and two tanks, one of which was unserviceable.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=153, 385}} On 20 May, the leading elements of the German [[XIX Army Corps (Germany)|XIX Corps]], (General [[Heinz Guderian]]), reached Abbeville. The importance of holding the Channel Ports as the only means of supply and if necessary, evacuation, became vital for the Allies.{{sfnm|1a1=Churchill|1y=1949|1p=53|2a1=Ellis|2y=2004|2p=153}} Early in the morning of 21 May, Dutfoy ordered the naval garrison of {{nowrap|1,100 men}} to retire behind the medieval walls of the {{lang|de|Haute Ville}} (Old Town or Citadel), east of the Liane river.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=190}}\n\nAfter hearing alarmist reports of the approach of a large German force, apparently from General Jean Pelissier de F\u00e9ligonde, who had commanded a unit attacked by German tanks at Hesdin, {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the south-east of the port, Dutfoy ordered his men to disable the [[Coastal artillery]] in the forts and to head for the harbour for evacuation. Dutfoy left for Dunkirk and discipline broke down, looting took place and civilians waiting for places on evacuation ships began to panic until the commander in charge of the sea front threatened people with a gun. The commander decamped at {{nowrap|10:00 a.m.}} and the [[Touch hole|spiking]] of the naval guns continued until the order was questioned. Admiral Leclerc in Dunkirk was contacted, who ordered the remaining guns to be preserved for the defence of the town and visited Boulogne early on 22 May. Leclerc ordered the sailors to fight it out and wait for relief by the French and British armies.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|pp=190\u2013191}} Admiral [[Jean-Marie Charles Abrial|Jean Abrial]] at Dunkirk ordered\n\n{{quote|You are to die at your posts one by one rather than give in.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|pp=190\u2013192}}}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Allied defensive preparations===\n\n{{see also|Siege of Calais (1940)#Siege of Calais|l1=Siege of Calais}}\n\n[[File:Map commune FR insee code 62160.png|thumb|{{centre|Modern map of Boulogne and vicinity (commune FR insee code 62160)}}]]\nA detachment of [[Royal Marines]] arrived in Boulogne in the early morning of 21 May.{{sfn|Jackson|2002|p=39}} Part of the [[20th Independent Infantry Brigade (Guards)|20th Guards Brigade]] ([[Brigadier]] [[William Fox-Pitt (British Army)|William Fox-Pitt]]), consisting of the 2nd Battalion, [[Welsh Guards]] and 2nd Battalion, [[Irish Guards]], was training at [[Camberley]] on 21 May, when ordered to embark for France.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=147}} With the brigade anti-tank company and a battery of 69th Anti-Tank Regiment, [[Royal Artillery]], the Guards arrived in Boulogne on the morning of 22 May on three merchant ships and the [[destroyer]] {{HMS|Vimy||6}}, escorted by the destroyers {{HMS|Whitshed|D77|6}} and {{HMS|Vimiera|1917|6}}.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|pp=147\u2013148}} The French [[21st Infantry Division (France)|21st Infantry Division]] (General [[Pierre Louis F\u00e9lix Lanquetot]]) was to hold a line between [[Samer]] and [[Desvres]], about {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of the town, where three battalions had already arrived. Further British reinforcements, including a regiment of [[cruiser tank]]s, were expected from Calais on the following day.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=154}}\n\nFox-Pitt deployed his men on the high ground outside the town, liaising with Lanquetot who organised the French troops in the town. The Irish Guards held the right flank to the south-west from the river at St. L\u00e9onard to the sea at Le Portel and the Welsh Guards the left flank north-east of the river on the west slopes of Mont Lambert ridge and high ground through St. Martin Boulogne, which made a defensive perimeter of {{cvt|6|mi|km|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=148}} Road blocks had been established by a party of about fifty men of the 7th [[Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment|Royal West Kents]] from [[Albert, Somme|Albert]], about 100 men of the 262nd Field Company [[Royal Engineers]] and anti-aircraft crew held the right flank of the Welsh Guards, along the roads approaching from the south.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=155}} Fox-Pitt had left a gap in the perimeter between the Welsh left flank and the coast for the reinforcements expected from Calais.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=50}} There were 1,500 men of No 5 Group [[Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps]] (AMPC) in the town awaiting evacuation, a mixture of recalled reservists and part-trained troops working as labourers.{{sfn|Jackson|2002|p=39}} Under French command were the fort garrisons and some French and Belgian training units of limited military value.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=153\u2013154}} Lanquetot had told Fox-Pitt that the French forces in Boulogne were \"folded up\" which Fox-Pitt inferred meant that they ready to give up.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=150}}\n\n===German offensive preparations===\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1980-004-32, Heinz Guderian in Bouillon, Frankreich.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|{{centre|Guderian during the Battle of France}}]]\nThe Franco-British counter-attack at Arras led the Germans to continue to attack north towards the Channel Ports, rather than south over the Somme and late on 21 May, ''[[Oberkommando des Heeres]]'' (OKH) ordered ''Panzergruppe Kleist'' to advance about {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} north, to capture Boulogne and Calais.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=155}} Apprehension about another counter-attack led to the XV Corps (General [[Hermann Hoth]]) being held back, a division of the XLI Corps (Major-General [[Georg-Hans Reinhardt]]) being moved eastwards and the [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] (Lieutenant-General [[Ferdinand Schaal]]) of XIX Corps was detached to guard against a counter-attack from the south. Parts of the [[1st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|1st Panzer Division]] (Lieutenant-General [[Friedrich Kirchner]]) and [[2nd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Panzer Division]] (Lieutenant-General [[Rudolf Veiel]]) were also held back to defend bridgeheads over the Somme.{{sfn|Cooper|1978|pp=227\u2013228}} The 2nd Panzer Division was ordered to advance to Boulogne on a line from [[Baincthun]] to Samer, with the 1st Panzer Division as a flank guard on the right, advancing to Desvres and [[Marquise, Pas-de-Calais|Marquise]] in case of a counter-attack from Calais.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=155}}\n\n==Battle==\n\n===22 May===\nThe 2nd Panzer Division formed two columns, one to circle round the town and attack from the north. The southern column made contact first in the early afternoon of 22 May, against the headquarters company of the French 48th Infantry Regiment, the only troops of the 21st Division who were between the Germans and Boulogne. The French clerks, drivers and signallers set up two {{nowrap|75 mm field}} guns and two {{nowrap|25 mm anti-tank}} guns to cover the cross-roads at [[Nesles]], where they delayed the Germans for almost two hours, until they were outflanked.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=192}} The column arrived at the outskirts of Boulogne in the evening and began shelling and probing the Irish Guards positions south of the town. The Irish knocked out the leading German tank and repulsed later attacks despite the Germans overrunning one of their forward platoons. In the early hours, the Germans attacked the Welsh Guards positions along the coast from the north-east as they began to envelop the town but were forced back each time.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=150}} Brownrigg, with Fox-Pitt's only communication link with England, departed with his staff at {{nowrap|3:00 a.m.}} on the destroyer {{HMS|Verity|D63|6}}, without informing the Guards. Only a few troops of the 21st Infantry Division were able take up its blocking positions near Desvres before the German advance reached them. The French managed to delay the 1st Panzer Division here for much of 22 May before Fox-Pitt was told at {{nowrap|4:00 a.m.}} that the French had fallen back to Boulogne by German tanks.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=156}} Most of the 21st Infantry Division, en route to Boulogne by train, ws ambushed by German tanks and dispersed.{{sfn|Windsor Lewis|1940|nopp=y}}\n\n===23 May===\n[[File:HMS Venomous WWI IWM P 1975.jpg|thumb|{{centre|HMS ''Venomous'', one of the World War I vintage British destroyers used in the evacuation}}]]\nAn hour after dawn, [[Fort de la Cr\u00e8che]] near Wimereux, north of Boulogne, was captured by German troops. The appearance of German armour at the northern perimeter confirmed to Fox-Pitt that there would be no reinforcements from Calais. This meant that Fox-Pitt would have to defend the port with only the two Guards battalions and the assorted French and British troops already in Boulogne.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=150}} Therefore, a force of 800 was hastily selected from those AMPC troops with previous military experience and armed with rifles taken from the others, they were rushed into the gap between the two Guards battalions, and a further 150 were sent to reinforce the Welsh Guards. Meanwhile, the anti-aircraft gunners guarding the southern approach roads destroyed two German tanks with their 3.7-inch guns AA before retiring.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=50}}\n\nThe Germans launched a pincer attack on the positions of the Welsh and Irish Guards. By {{nowrap|10:00 a.m.,}} the attack from the south, backed up by artillery and air support, made the open slopes around the town untenable and forced the Guards back into the town.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=151}} [[Generalmajor]] [[Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen]], commanding the specialist ground-attack [[8th Air Corps (Germany)|Fliegerkorps VIII]], ordered his ''Stukas'' to destroy the fortifications at Boulogne. The ability of the Luftwaffe to destroy fortifications was invaluable to the German army.{{sfn|Corum|2008|p=207}} At midday, ''Vimy'' arrived, carrying a naval demolition party and Force Buttercup, a [[Royal Marine]] shore party, began to embark the wounded and the AMPC. Orders were passed on from ''Vimy'' to Fox-Pitt that the Guards were to hold Boulogne at all costs, as his radio contact with England had been lost earlier in the day.{{sfn|Jackson|2002|p=40}} The Royal Navy and French destroyers also provided the only fire support to the troops resisting the German advance on the outskirts of the town.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=151}} The commanders of the 2nd Panzer Division found that the British and French in Boulogne were \"fighting tenaciously for every inch of ground\" to such an extent that they could not tell if the British were evacuating or reinforcing the town.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=157}}\n\nDuring the afternoon there was a lull, followed by a raid by the {{lang|de|[[Luftwaffe]]}} which was intercepted by [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[Spitfire]]s from [[No. 92 Squadron RAF|92 Squadron]]. The commanders of both British destroyers were killed by bomb splinters and Ju 87 {{lang|de|[[Stuka]]}} dive bombers hit {{ship|French destroyer|Frondeur||2}} which was disabled; {{ship|French destroyer|Orage||2}} had to be [[Scuttling|scuttled]] as they bombarded German shore positions.{{sfn|Jackson|2002|p=40}} The destroyer's assailants were Ju 87s from I/[[Sturzkampfgeschwader 77]].{{sfn|Dildy|2015|p=81}}{{sfn|de Zeng|Stankey|Creek|2009|p=129}} ''Whitshed'' was damaged by a near-miss in the same attack, but continued to operate.{{sfn|Smith|2011|p=133}} The [[dogfight]] cost 92 Squadron five Spitfires, two pilots killed, two captured and one wounded\u2014one in action with [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]s the others in action with [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]]s. [[Squadron Leader]] [[Roger Bushell]] was among those captured.{{sfn|Franks|1997|p=31}} Shortly before the air raid, the destroyer {{HMS|Keith|1930|6}} had berthed in the harbour and begun embarking AMPC troops. By {{nowrap|3:00 p.m.,}} Fox-Pitt withdrew the brigade to new positions in the town and moved his headquarters to a position by the quay better to contact the destroyers, his only means of communicating with London. With direct German fire sweeping the docks, he sent a message to London saying \"situation grave\".{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=153}} Shortly before {{nowrap|6:00 p.m.,}} ''Keith'' had received orders for an immediate evacuation of the British force and that five more destroyers were either standing off Boulogne, giving gunfire support or were ''en route''. Fox-Pitt decided to continue with the AMPC evacuation, while the Guards conducted a fighting withdrawal to the harbour. Due to a lack of radios, the forward British troops had to be reached by dispatch rider. The bridges held by the Guards were demolished by the Royal Engineers before the Irish Guards barricaded the streets with vehicles and withdrew to the harbour.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=153}} ''Vimiera'' and ''Whitshed'' replaced ''Vimy'' and ''Keith'', embarking many of the Marines, Irish and Welsh Guards.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=157}} The harbour was full of ships, and despite a two-''gruppen'' [group\u2014approximate strength of 30] attack by Ju 87s no ships were hit but casualties were sustained when bombs hit the quayside near ''Vimy'' and ''Keith''.{{sfn|Smith|2011|p=133}}\n\n[[File:Boulogne gare maritime bateau cpa.jpg|thumb|{{centre|A pre-war photograph of the {{lang|fr|Gare Maritime}} at Boulogne, showing the quay used by British destroyers during the evacuation}}]]\n{{HMS|Venomous|D75|6}} and {{HMS|Wild Swan|D62|6}} arrived and began embarking Force Buttercup and the remainder of the Irish Guards. The Germans had taken up positions overlooking the harbour and engaged the Guards and the ships, which used their guns to counter the German fire. German tanks advanced towards the quayside but were knocked out by the [[4.7 inch gun]]s of ''Venomous'', one tank turning \"over and over, like a child doing a cart-wheel\".{{sfn|Hawkins|2003|p=70}} German [[field gun]]s bombarded the harbour and as {{HMS|Venetia}} moved through the narrow entrance channel, it was hit several times and set on fire but managed to reverse out and make way for ''Venomous'' and ''Wild Swan'' which also backed out, ''Venomous'' steering with its engines as the rudder had jammed.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=157}}\n\n===24\u201325 May===\n{{HMS|Windsor|D42|6}} arrived after dark and was able to continue the embarkation. On clearing the harbour, the captain signalled that there were still British troops requiring evacuation and ''Vimiera'' was sent back, arriving in Boulogne at {{nowrap|1:30 a.m.}} The quayside was deserted but the captain called out by [[loud hailer]] and found that many men were in hiding and packed then into every available space. When ''Vimiera'' arrived at Dover at {{nowrap|4:00 a.m.,}} {{nowrap|1,400 men}} disembarked (including [[Arnold Ridley]]).{{sfn|Gardner|2000|pp=8\u201310}} Most of the British troops had been evacuated but about {{nowrap|300 Welsh}} Guards remained in the town.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=155}} Lack of radio communication left three of the Welsh Guards forward companies out of contact and by the time they had been informed of the evacuation, two companies had been cut off from the docks; both companies split into groups and attempted a break-out to the north-east.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=158}} Lanquetot had established his headquarters within the medieval walls of the {{lang|fr|Haute Ville}} (Old Town, the Citadel), awaiting the arrival of elements of the 21st Division. When he discovered that disaster had befallen his division, he organised the defence of the town as best he could.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=156}} By the time that Brigadier Fox-Pitt had received orders to evacuate, there were no means of communication with Lanquetot who could not be informed of the British retreat.{{sfn|Windsor Lewis|1940|nopp=y}}\n\n[[File:Boulogne-sur-Mer - Porte Gayolle.jpg|thumb|{{centre|A gate in the medieval town walls, defended by parties of the 21st Infantry Division}}]]\nOn the evening of 24 May, the Germans attacked the town at {{nowrap|6:00 p.m.}} and {{nowrap|8:00 p.m.}} The attacks were repulsed and some German tanks were reported to have been destroyed. The French Navy continued its fire support but the destroyers {{ship|French destroyer|Fougueux||2}} and {{ship|French destroyer|Chacal||2}} were damaged by the {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}} and ''Chacal'' was later sunk by German artillery. During the night, about {{nowrap|100 French}} soldiers tried to break out towards Dunkirk but failed. At dawn on 25 May, the Germans assaulted the walls again using ladders, grenades and [[flamethrower]]s, supported by [[8.8 cm Flak 18/36/37/41|88 mm guns]] and at {{nowrap|8:30 a.m.,}} Lanquetot surrendered.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=158}} [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stukas'' from [[Sturzkampfgeschwader 2]] furnished the German infantry with [[close air support]]. The Ju 87s reduced the town, but experienced their first encounter with [[RAF Fighter Command]]. Operations over Boulogne and Calais cost the German unit four Ju 87s on 25 May.{{sfn|Jackson|1974|p=115}}\n\nThe final remaining British unit in Boulogne was No. 3 Company, Welsh Guards under the command of Major Windsor Lewis. No. 3 Company did not arrive at the docks till daybreak, after the departure of ''Vimiera''.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=155}} Lewis also took under his command a large party of stragglers, who were awaiting rescue in the sheds at the quayside.

When the sheds came under German fire, Lewis moved the group into the {{lang|fr|Gare Maritime}} (harbour railway station) and made [[sandbag]] barricades. On the evening of 24 May, under fire from tanks and machine-guns, they repulsed a German assault party that had approached the quay in a boat. Without food, running low on ammunition and realising that there would be no further evacuation, the force surrendered at {{nowrap|1:00 p.m.}} on 25 May.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=158}} The Germans captured {{nowrap|5,000 Allied}} troops in Boulogne, the majority of whom were French.{{sfn|Rickard|2008|nopp=y}} Many of the prisoners were put to work repairing the harbour fortifications to resist a British amphibious assault.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=158}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Analysis===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|+<small>'''Approximate number of troops evacuated, 23\u201324 May 1940'''</small>{{sfn|Gardner|2000|p=10}}\n|-\n!

The retention of the 10th Panzer Division in reserve during the attacks on Boulogne and Calais, meant that the Aa Canal could not be attacked simultaneously. Had the panzers not been delayed, the preparations of the 20th Guards Brigade might have been interrupted. The long, exposed flank of [[Army Group A]], the uncertain hold on Amiens and Abbeville and the Allied possession of Arras, meant that the situation on 22 May could have changed and the delay was not excessive, since the Allied counter-attack at Arras could have continued.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=159}} In 1954, [[Stephen Roskill]], wrote that the defence of Boulogne delayed the advance of the XIX Corps towards Dunkirk (\"undoubtedly contributed to that end\"), which assisted the Allied defence during the [[Battle of Dunkirk]] {{nowrap|(26 May\u20134 June).}}{{sfn|Roskill|1954|p=213}} The Welsh and Irish Guards were awarded the [[battle honour]] \"Boulogne 1940\".{{sfn|Baker|1986|p=146}}\n\n==Orders of battle==\n\n===XIX Corps===\n\nData from the British official volume ''The War in France and Flanders 1939\u20131940'' (1954 [2004 ed.]) unless indicated.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=368, 402\u2013403}}\n* {{lang|de|[[Panzergruppe Kleist]]}} (General of Cavalry [[Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist]], Chief of Staff Brigadier-General [[Kurt Zeitzler]])\n** [[XIX Panzer Corps (Germany)|XIX Corps]] (General of Cavalry [[Heinz Guderian]])\n*** [[1st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|1st Panzer Division]] (Major-General [[Friedrich Kirchner]])\n*** [[2nd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Panzer Division]] (Major-General [[Rudolf Veiel]])\n*** [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] (Major-General [[Ferdinand Schaal]])\n** [[XXXXI Panzer Corps (Germany)|XXXXI Corps]] (Major-General [[Georg-Hans Reinhardt]])\n*** [[6th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|6th Panzer Division]] (Brigadier-General [[Werner Kempf]])\n*** [[8th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|8th Panzer Division]] (Colonel [[Erich Brandenberger]])\n\n===Boulogne garrison===\n\nData from the British official volume ''The War in France and Flanders 1939\u20131940'' (1954 [2004 ed.]) unless indicated.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=368, 402\u2013403}}\n* [[21st Infantry Division (France)|21st Infantry Division]] (General Pierre Louis F\u00e9lix Lanquetot)\n** Headquarters company, 48th Infantry Regiment\n* French and Belgian training units\n* [[20th Independent Infantry Brigade (Guards)|20th Guards Brigade Group]] (Brigadier William Fox-Pitt)\n** 2nd Battalion, [[Irish Guards]]\n** 2nd Battalion, [[Welsh Guards]]\n** 20th Guards Brigade Anti-Tank Company\n** 69th Anti-Tank Regiment, [[Royal Artillery]] (one battery)\n* 1,500 men [[Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps]] (untrained)\n* Force Buttercup (Royal Marine demolition party)\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|World War II}}\n* [[Boulogne Bowl]], a commemorative silver trophy in recognition of the role of the Pioneer Corps in the 1940 Battle of Boulogne\n* [[Operation Wellhit]], the Canadian liberation of Boulogne in 1944\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n===Books===\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Baker|1986}}\n|last=Baker |first=A. |year=1986 |title=Battle Honours of the British and Commonwealth Armies |publisher=Ian Allan |location=London |isbn=978-0-71101-600-2}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Bond|Taylor|2001}}\n|title=The Battle for France & Flanders Sixty Years On |editor1-last=Bond |editor1-first=B. |editor1-link=Brian Bond |editor2-last=Taylor |editor2-first=M.

The battle was fought at the same time as the [[Siege of Calais (1940)|Siege of Calais]], just before [[Operation Dynamo]], the evacuation of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) through [[Dunkirk]]. After the Franco-British counter-attack at the [[Battle of Arras (1940)|Battle of Arras]] on 21 May German units were held ready to resist a resumption of the attack on 22 May, despite the protests of General [[Heinz Guderian]], the commander of XIX Corps, who wanted to rush north up the Channel coast to capture Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk. An attack by part of XIX Corps was not authorised until {{nowrap|12:40 p.m.}} on 22 May, by when the Allied troops at Boulogne had been reinforced from England by most of the [[20th Independent Infantry Brigade (Guards)|20th Guards Brigade]].\n\nThe Guards had time to dig in around the port before the [[2nd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Panzer Division]], which had been delayed by French troops at [[Samer]], attacked the perimeter held by the Irish Guards at around {{nowrap|5:00 p.m.}} and were driven off after an hour of fighting. The Welsh Guards front was attacked at {{nowrap|8:00 p.m.}} and again at dusk before cutting off a party of the Irish at {{nowrap|10:00 p.m.}} At dawn on 23 May, the German attacks resumed, eventually pushing the defenders back into the town. About eighty light bombers of the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) flw in the defence of Boulogne. \n\nRoyal Navy ships shot their way into and out of the harbour and with French navy destroyers, bombarded German positions as wounded and non-combatants were embarked and a navy demolition party landed. During a lull in the afternoon of 23 May, the {{lang|de|[[Luftwaffe]]}} bombed the harbour, despite being intercepted by RAF fighters. At {{nowrap|6:30 p.m.}} the Guards Brigade was ordered to re-embark and the British destroyers ran the gauntlet of German tanks and artillery to evacuate them. The French defenders around the Citadel above the lower town could not be contacted and only in the morning of 24 May did General Lanquetot realise that the British had gone, which led to reproaches.\n\nThe French and remaining British troops held out until 25 May and then surrendered. Guderian wrote that the halt order and then the retention of considerable forces to guard against Allied counter-attacks, had forfeited an opportunity quickly to capture the [[Channel Ports]] and destroy the Allied forces in northern France and Belgium. An advance on Dunkirk began on 23 May but the next day was halted until 27 May; Dunkirk was not captured until 4 June, by when most of the BEF and many French and Belgian troops had escaped.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Boulogne===\n\n{{main|Boulogne-sur-Mer}}\n[[File:C\u00f4te d'Opale topographic map-fr.svg|thumb|{{centre|Map of the {{lang|fr|C\u00f4te d'Opale}}}}]]\nBoulogne-sur-Mer, [[Calais]], [[Dunkirk]] and [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]], are [[Channel Ports]] on the French side at the narrowest part of the English Channel. Boulogne is at the mouth of the fast-flowing [[Liane (river)|Liane]] river, which meanders through a valley. The harbour is on a level area of ground on either side of the river, well built-up and with steep roads uphill to the old town ({{lang|fr|Haute Ville}} or the Citadel). The rolling hills make for hidden approaches to the port and offer commanding high ground to an attacker, particularly the Mont St. Lambert ridge.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=155}} During the [[Phoney War]] {{nowrap|(September 1939 \u2013 10 May 1940)}}, the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) had been supplied through ports further to the west, such as [[Le Havre]] and [[Cherbourg]] but the Channel Ports came into use once mine barrages had been laid  in the [[English Channel]] in late 1939, to reduce the demand for ships and escorts. When leave from the BEF began in December, Boulogne was used for communication and for troop movements.{{sfnm|1a1=Ellis|1y=2004|1p=16|2a1=Bond|2a2=Taylor|2y=2001|2p=130}}\n\n===Battle of France===\n\n{{see also|Order of battle for the Battle of France|British Expeditionary Force order of battle (1940)}}\nOn 10 May 1940, the Germans began {{lang|de|[[Manstein Plan|Fall Gelb]]}} (Case Yellow) the offensive against France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Within a few days, the Germans achieved a breakthrough against the centre of the French front near [[Sedan, France|Sedan]] and drove westwards down the Somme river valley. As the BEF withdrew through Belgium into northern France, fewer supply troops were needed as the lines of communication shortened. The British began to withdraw surplus manpower through Boulogne and Calais and on 17 May, General [[Douglas Brownrigg]], the Adjutant-General of the BEF, moved the Rear General Headquarters (GHQ) from [[Arras]] to Boulogne without informing his French liaison officers.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|pp=188, 190}}{{efn|Relations among Franco-British commanders had been good until the German breakthrough on the Meuse, after which the British staff officers became apprehensive that they might be cut off from the coast, began slighting the liaison officers and withheld information. The French liaison party left Boulogne after a {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}} air raid on the night of {{nowrap|19/20 May}} and reached Abbeville just before the Germans.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|pp=188, 190}}}} The Germans captured [[Abbeville]] at the mouth of the [[Somme River]] on 21 May, cutting off the Allied troops in Northern France and Belgium from their bases south of the river.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=153}}\n\nThe defence of Boulogne was the responsibility of the [[French Navy]] ({{lang|fr|Marine Nationale}}), which manned some 19th-century forts under the command of Commandant Dutfoy de Mont de Benque.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=190}} To protect Boulogne from air attack, eight [[QF 3.7-inch AA gun|3.7-inch anti-aircraft]] guns of the 2nd Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, eight machine-guns of the 58th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment and a battery of the 2nd Searchlight Regiment had arrived from England on 20 May; the French had two {{nowrap|75 mm field}} guns, two {{nowrap|25 mm anti-tank}} guns and two tanks, one of which was unserviceable.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=153, 385}} On 20 May, the leading elements of the German [[XIX Army Corps (Germany)|XIX Corps]], (General [[Heinz Guderian]]), reached Abbeville.

Dutfoy left for Dunkirk and discipline broke down, looting took place and civilians waiting for places on evacuation ships began to panic until the commander in charge of the sea front threatened people with a gun. The commander decamped at {{nowrap|10:00 a.m.}} and the [[Touch hole|spiking]] of the naval guns continued until the order was questioned. Admiral Leclerc in Dunkirk was contacted, who ordered the remaining guns to be preserved for the defence of the town and visited Boulogne early on 22 May.

The southern column made contact first in the early afternoon of 22 May, against the headquarters company of the French 48th Infantry Regiment, the only troops of the 21st Division who were between the Germans and Boulogne. The French clerks, drivers and signallers set up two {{nowrap|75 mm field}} guns and two {{nowrap|25 mm anti-tank}} guns to cover the cross-roads at [[Nesles]], where they delayed the Germans for almost two hours, until they were outflanked.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2006|p=192}} The column arrived at the outskirts of Boulogne in the evening and began shelling and probing the Irish Guards positions south of the town. The Irish knocked out the leading German tank and repulsed later attacks despite the Germans overrunning one of their forward platoons. In the early hours, the Germans attacked the Welsh Guards positions along the coast from the north-east as they began to envelop the town but were forced back each time.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=150}} Brownrigg, with Fox-Pitt's only communication link with England, departed with his staff at {{nowrap|3:00 a.m.}} on the destroyer {{HMS|Verity||6}}, without informing the Guards.

The appearance of German armour at the northern perimeter confirmed to Fox-Pitt that there would be no reinforcements from Calais. This meant that Fox-Pitt would have to defend the port with only the two Guards battalions and the assorted French and British troops already in Boulogne.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=150}} Therefore, a force of 800 was hastily selected from those AMPC troops with previous military experience and armed with rifles taken from the others, they were rushed into the gap between the two Guards battalions, and a further 150 were sent to reinforce the Welsh Guards. Meanwhile, the anti-aircraft gunners guarding the southern approach roads destroyed two German tanks with their 3.7-inch guns AA before retiring.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=50}}\n\nThe Germans launched a pincer attack on the positions of the Welsh and Irish Guards. By {{nowrap|10:00 a.m.,}} the attack from the south, backed up by artillery and air support, made the open slopes around the town untenable and forced the Guards back into the town.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=151}} [[Generalmajor]] [[Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen]], commanding the specialist ground-attack [[8th Air Corps (Germany)|Fliegerkorps VIII]], ordered his ''Stukas'' to destroy the fortifications at Boulogne. The ability of the Luftwaffe to destroy fortifications was invaluable to the German army.{{sfn|Corum|2008|p=207}} At midday, ''Vimy'' arrived, carrying a naval demolition party and Force Buttercup, a [[Royal Marine]] shore party, began to embark the wounded and the AMPC. Orders were passed on from ''Vimy'' to Fox-Pitt that the Guards were to hold Boulogne at all costs, as his radio contact with England had been lost earlier in the day.{{sfn|Jackson|2002|p=40}} The Royal Navy and French destroyers also provided the only fire support to the troops resisting the German advance on the outskirts of the town.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=151}} The commanders of the 2nd Panzer Division found that the British and French in Boulogne were \"fighting tenaciously for every inch of ground\" to such an extent that they could not tell if the British were evacuating or reinforcing the town.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=157}}\n\nDuring the afternoon there was a lull, followed by a raid by the {{lang|de|[[Luftwaffe]]}} which was intercepted by [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[Spitfire]]s from [[No. 92 Squadron RAF|92 Squadron]].

By {{nowrap|3:00 p.m.,}} Fox-Pitt withdrew the brigade to new positions in the town and moved his headquarters to a position by the quay better to contact the destroyers, his only means of communicating with London. With direct German fire sweeping the docks, he sent a message to London saying \"situation grave\".{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=153}} Shortly before {{nowrap|6:00 p.m.,}} ''Keith'' had received orders for an immediate evacuation of the British force and that five more destroyers were either standing off Boulogne, giving gunfire support or were ''en route''. Fox-Pitt decided to continue with the AMPC evacuation, while the Guards conducted a fighting withdrawal to the harbour. Due to a lack of radios, the forward British troops had to be reached by dispatch rider. The bridges held by the Guards were demolished by the Royal Engineers before the Irish Guards barricaded the streets with vehicles and withdrew to the harbour.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=153}} ''Vimiera'' and ''Whitshed'' replaced ''Vimy'' and ''Keith'', embarking many of the Marines, Irish and Welsh Guards.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=157}} The harbour was full of ships, and despite a two-''gruppen'' [group\u2014approximate strength of 30] attack by Ju 87s no ships were hit but casualties were sustained when bombs hit the quayside near ''Vimy'' and ''Keith''.{{sfn|Smith|2011|p=133}}\n\n[[File:Boulogne gare maritime bateau cpa.jpg|thumb|{{centre|A pre-war photograph of the {{lang|fr|Gare Maritime}} at Boulogne, showing the quay used by British destroyers during the evacuation}}]]\n{{HMS|Venomous|D75|6}} and {{HMS|Wild Swan|D62|6}} arrived and began embarking Force Buttercup and the remainder of the Irish Guards. The Germans had taken up positions overlooking the harbour and engaged the Guards and the ships, which used their guns to counter the German fire. German tanks advanced towards the quayside but were knocked out by the [[4.7 inch gun]]s of ''Venomous'', one tank turning \"over and over, like a child doing a cart-wheel\".{{sfn|Hawkins|2003|p=70}} German [[field gun]]s bombarded the harbour and as {{HMS|Venetia}} moved through the narrow entrance channel, it was hit several times and set on fire but managed to reverse out and make way for ''Venomous'' and ''Wild Swan'' which also backed out, ''Venomous'' steering with its engines as the rudder had jammed.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=157}}\n\n===24\u201325 May===\n{{HMS|Windsor|D42|6}} arrived after dark and was able to continue the embarkation. On clearing the harbour, the captain signalled that there were still British troops requiring evacuation and ''Vimiera'' was sent back, arriving in Boulogne at {{nowrap|1:30 a.m.}} The quayside was deserted but the captain called out by [[loud hailer]] and found that many men were in hiding and packed then into every available space.

During the night, about {{nowrap|100 French}} soldiers tried to break out towards Dunkirk but failed. At dawn on 25 May, the Germans assaulted the walls again using ladders, grenades and [[flamethrower]]s, supported by [[8.8 cm Flak 18/36/37/41|88 mm guns]] and at {{nowrap|8:30 a.m.,}} Lanquetot surrendered.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=158}} [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stukas'' from [[Sturzkampfgeschwader 2]] furnished the German infantry with [[close air support]].

The retention of the 10th Panzer Division in reserve during the attacks on Boulogne and Calais, meant that the Aa Canal could not be attacked simultaneously. Had the panzers not been delayed, the preparations of the 20th Guards Brigade might have been interrupted. The long, exposed flank of [[Army Group A]], the uncertain hold on Amiens and Abbeville and the Allied possession of Arras, meant that the situation on 22 May could have changed and the delay was not excessive, since the Allied counter-attack at Arras could have continued.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=159}} In 1954, [[Stephen Roskill]], wrote that the defence of Boulogne delayed the advance of the XIX Corps towards Dunkirk (\"undoubtedly contributed to that end\"), which assisted the Allied defence during the [[Battle of Dunkirk]] {{nowrap|(26 May\u20134 June).}}{{sfn|Roskill|1954|p=213}} The Welsh and Irish Guards were awarded the [[battle honour]] \"Boulogne 1940\".{{sfn|Baker|1986|p=146}}\n\n==Orders of battle==\n\n===XIX Corps===\n\nData from the British official volume ''The War in France and Flanders 1939\u20131940'' (1954 [2004 ed.]) unless indicated.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=368, 402\u2013403}}\n* {{lang|de|[[Panzergruppe Kleist]]}} (General of Cavalry [[Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist]], Chief of Staff Brigadier-General [[Kurt Zeitzler]])\n** [[XIX Panzer Corps (Germany)|XIX Corps]] (General of Cavalry [[Heinz Guderian]])\n*** [[1st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|1st Panzer Division]] (Major-General [[Friedrich Kirchner]])\n*** [[2nd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Panzer Division]] (Major-General [[Rudolf Veiel]])\n*** [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] (Major-General [[Ferdinand Schaal]])\n** [[XXXXI Panzer Corps (Germany)|XXXXI Corps]] (Major-General [[Georg-Hans Reinhardt]])\n*** [[6th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|6th Panzer Division]] (Brigadier-General [[Werner Kempf]])\n*** [[8th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|8th Panzer Division]] (Colonel [[Erich Brandenberger]])\n\n===Boulogne garrison===\n\nData from the British official volume ''The War in France and Flanders 1939\u20131940'' (1954 [2004 ed.]) unless indicated.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=368, 402\u2013403}}\n* [[21st Infantry Division (France)|21st Infantry Division]] (General Pierre Louis F\u00e9lix Lanquetot)\n** Headquarters company, 48th Infantry Regiment\n* French and Belgian training units\n* [[20th Independent Infantry Brigade (Guards)|20th Guards Brigade Group]] (Brigadier William Fox-Pitt)\n** 2nd Battalion, [[Irish Guards]]\n** 2nd Battalion, [[Welsh Guards]]\n** 20th Guards Brigade Anti-Tank Company\n** 69th Anti-Tank Regiment, [[Royal Artillery]] (one battery)\n* 1,500 men [[Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps]] (untrained)\n* Force Buttercup (Royal Marine demolition party)\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|World War II}}\n* [[Boulogne Bowl]], a commemorative silver trophy in recognition of the role of the Pioneer Corps in the 1940 Battle of Boulogne\n* [[Operation Wellhit]], the Canadian liberation of Boulogne in 1944\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n===Books===\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Baker|1986}}\n|last=Baker |first=A. |year=1986 |title=Battle Honours of the British and Commonwealth Armies |publisher=Ian Allan |location=London |isbn=978-0-71101-600-2}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Bond|Taylor|2001}}\n|title=The Battle for France & Flanders Sixty Years On |editor1-last=Bond |editor1-first=B. |editor1-link=Brian Bond |editor2-last=Taylor |editor2-first=M.

TMC is now owned by the [[Showtime Networks]] subsidiary of [[ViacomCBS]] \u2013 previously under [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] from 1983 to 2005). Cinemax was originally owned by [[Time Inc.|Time-Life Inc.]], which later merged with Warner Communications in 1989 to form the present-day WarnerMedia (formerly called Time Warner).\n\nUnlike HBO \u2013 and most [[cable network|cable]] and broadcast channels already on the air at the time of its launch \u2013 Cinemax had broadcast a 24-hour-a-day schedule from its sign-on (HBO ran only nine hours of programming a day from 3:00&nbsp;p.m. to midnight [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] until September 1981, when it adopted a 24-hour weekend schedule that ran until midnight Eastern Time on Sunday nights; it implemented the round-the-clock schedule on weekdays as well on December 28 of that year). On-air spokesman [[Robert Culp]] told viewers that Cinemax would be about movies, and nothing but movies. At the time, HBO featured a wider range of programming, including some entertainment news interstitials, [[documentary film|documentaries]], children's programming, sporting events and [[television special]]s (in the form of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] plays, [[stand-up comedy]] acts and [[concert]]s). Movie classics were a mainstay of Cinemax at its birth, presented \"all uncut and commercial-free\" as Culp said on-air. A heavy schedule of films from the 1950s to the 1970s made up most of the channel's program schedule.\n\nCinemax succeeded in its early years because cable television subscribers typically had access to only about three dozen channels due to system [[cable television headend|headends]] at the time of Cinemax's debut being capable of carrying only a [[channel capacity|limited number of channels]]. Movies were the most sought-after program category among cable subscribers at the time, and that Cinemax would show classic films without commercial interruptions and editing for time and content made the channel an attractive add-on for HBO subscribers. In many cases, cable providers would not sell Cinemax to customers who did not already have a subscription to HBO. The two channels were typically sold as a package, and were usually offered at a discount for subscribers that chose to get both channels. The typical pricing for a monthly subscription to HBO in the early 1980s was US$12.95 per month, while Cinemax typically could be added for between US$7 and $10 extra per month.\n\nIn 1983, Time-Life Inc. filed a federal [[trademark infringement]] lawsuit against [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] [[KOKI-TV]] (now a [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate) in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]], [[Oklahoma]] and its owners Tulsa 23, Ltd. over the use of the slogan \"We Are Your Movie Star\", which both the [[television station]] and Cinemax were using as their slogans at that time; the suit went into proceedings in an Oklahoma [[Federal District Court]], Cinemax lost the case. As additional movie-oriented channels launched on cable television, Cinemax began to change its programming philosophy in order to maintain its subscriber base. First, the channel opted to schedule R-rated movies during daytime slots (HBO would only show R-rated movies during the nighttime hours, after 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time, a policy that network largely continues to adhere to {{as of|2015|lc=y}}); Cinemax then decided it could compete by airing more [[softcore pornography|adult-oriented movies]] that contained [[nudity]] and depictions of [[sexual intercourse]], launching the weekly \"Friday After Dark\" late-night block in 1984 (which also featured the short-lived adult drama ''Scandals'', and a series of [[anthology series|anthology specials]] under the ''Eros America'' and ''Eros International'' banners).\n\nDuring the network's first decade on the air, Cinemax had also aired some original music programming: during the mid-to-late 1980s, upon the meteoric rise in popularity of [[MTV]], Cinemax began airing [[music video]]s in the form of an [[Interstitial program|interstitial]] that ran during extended breaks between films called ''MaxTrax''; it also ran music specials under the banner ''Cinemax Sessions''<ref>{{cite web|title='Fats Domino and Friends' on Cable|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/31/arts/fats-domino-and-friends-on-cable.html|last=Pareles|first=Jon|work=The New York Times|date=July 31, 1986|accessdate=August 20, 2017}}</ref> as well as the music interview and performance series ''Album Flash'' during that same time period. The mid- and late-1980s also saw the addition of a limited amount of series programming onto Cinemax's schedule including the [[sketch comedy]] series ''[[Second City Television]]'' (whose U.S. broadcast rights were acquired by the channel from [[NBC]] in 1983) and the [[science fiction]] series ''[[Max Headroom (TV series)|Max Headroom]]'' (which had also aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from 1987 to 1988). Comedy specials were also occasionally broadcast on the channel during the late 1980s, under the ''[[Cinemax Comedy Experiment]]'' banner, featuring free-form [[sketch comedy|sketch]] and [[improvisational comedy|improvisational]] styles from various rising and established [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comics]] (such as [[Howie Mandel]], [[Chris Elliott]] and [[Eric Bogosian]]). Although its programming had diversified, Cinemax had foremost remained a movie channel. In February 1988, the network premiere broadcast of the 1987 action-comedy ''[[Lethal Weapon]]'' became the highest rated telecast in Cinemax's history at that time, averaging a 16.9 rating and 26 share.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cinemax shows strength as it turns 10|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-8934460.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105130814/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-8934460.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 5, 2012|last=Mitchell|first=Kim|work=[[MultiChannel News]]|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=September 3, 1990}}</ref>\n\nBy 1990, Cinemax limited its programming lineup mainly to movies. However starting in 1992, Cinemax re-entered into television series development with the addition of adult-oriented scripted series similar in content to the softcore pornographic films featured on the channel in late night (such as the network's first original adult series ''Erotic Confessions'', and later series entries such as ''Hot Line'', ''[[Passion Cove]]'', ''[[Lingerie (TV series)|Lingerie]]'' and ''[[Co-Ed Confidential]]''), marking a return to adult series for the channel.\n\nFrom 1992 to 1997, Cinemax aired daily movie showcases in set timeslots, centering on a certain genre which differed each day of the week; with the introduction of a new on-air presentation package in 1993, the genre of a given showcase was represented by various [[pictogram]]s that usually appeared within a specialized feature presentation bumper before the start of the movie;<ref name=\"Cinemax makeover\">{{cite web|title=Little brother Cinemax gets extensive makeover|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-13619333.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105130753/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-13619333.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 5, 2012|last=Granger|first=Rod|work=MultiChannel News|via=HighBeam Research|date=November 2, 1992|accessdate=August 20, 2017}}</ref> the symbols included: \"Comedy\" (represented by an abstract face made up of various movie props, with an open mouth made to appear like it is laughing),<ref>{{cite web|title=Cinemax Monday Comedy Movie Intro|url=http://www.gatasi.com/video/ba9Ti7VboiY/cinemax-monday-comedy.html|work=Gatasi|accessdate=August 20, 2017}}</ref> \"Suspense\" (represented by a running man silhouette within a jagged film strip), \"Premiere\" (represented by an [[exclamation mark]] immersed in spotlights), \"Horror\" (represented by a skull augmented with a devil horn and a gear-shaped eye, overlaid in front on a [[casket]]), \"Drama\" (represented by abstract comedy and tragedy masks),<ref>{{YouTube|title=Cinemax Drama Intro|id=uu7SZ-xfDrU}}</ref> \"Vanguard\" (represented by a [[globe]] overlaid on a film strip), \"Action\" (represented by a [[machine gun]] and an explosion) and \"Classic\" (represented by a classic movie-era couple embracing and kissing).

Cinemax did not have set start or end times for the block, as they varied depending on the mainstream feature films \u2013 and original series on certain nights \u2013 that aired prior to and following it, and also depended on the number of programs and programs in particular that were scheduled to air within the block. Programs that aired under the Max After Dark banner carried either a TV-MA or R rating (usually the former), primarily for [[sexual intercourse|strong sexual content]] and [[nudity]]. The block had often been the subject of both scrutiny in the media and a source of humor in [[popular culture]], with references to Cinemax's late night programming being featured in various films and television shows. Because of the block's presence, Cinemax was most commonly given the jocular nickname, \"Skinemax\".<ref name=skinemax>{{cite web|title='70's soft-core brought safe sex to cinemas|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston-sub/doc/404992424.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=&type=current&date=Feb%2019,%202006&author=&pub=&edition=&startpage=&desc=|last=Burr|first=Ty|authorlink=Ty Burr|work=[[Boston Globe]]|date=February 19, 2006|accessdate=August 1, 2017}}</ref> The network itself had acknowledged this by using a play on this term for its 2011 documentary series, ''Skin to the Max''. The late night adult series that aired first-run episodes were ''[[Lingerie (TV series)|Lingerie]]'', ''[[Life on Top]]'', ''[[Femme Fatales (TV series)|Femme Fatales]]'', ''[[Zane\u2019s The Jump Off]]'', ''Working Girls in Bed'' and ''Topless Prophet'' (which debuted on May 30, 2014 as the network's first [[reality television|reality series]] and followed the world of [[exotic dancing]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]).<ref>{{cite web|title='Topless Prophet:' The Latest Detroit Entry in the TV World|url=http://www.deadlinedetroit.com/articles/9542/topless_prophet_the_latest_detroit_entry_in_the_tv_world|last=Lengel|first=Allan|work=Deadline Detroit|date=June 9, 2014|accessdate=August 1, 2017}}</ref> Adult films often aired alongside these series, though this depended on the Cinemax multiplex channel and sometimes depending on that night's Max After Dark schedule on each channel. The block originally debuted on May 4, 1984, as a weekly block called \"Cinemax Friday After Dark\"; these adult programs eventually expanded to seven-night-a-week airings by the late 1990s. Cinemax maintained an on-air policy \u2013 that had been in effect since 1993 \u2013 not to air any adult programming on its main channel before 11:30&nbsp;p.m. ET.<ref name=\"Cinemax makeover\"/> \n\nThe adult programming featured on Max After Dark was not limited solely to the main Cinemax channel: MoreMax also aired softcore pornographic films and series, sometimes airing earlier (10:30&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time at the earliest) than the main Cinemax channel would allow; ActionMax, ThrillerMax and OuterMax also featured adult films on their late night schedules, even though the softcore adult films and series did not necessarily fit the respective formats of these multiplex services. Conversely, MovieMax (which is aimed at families) and 5StarMax (which carries a format of largely critically acclaimed, mainstream feature films) generally do not run any adult programs because of their respective programming formats. Some of the adult films featured on the Max After Dark block also aired late nights on sister channel HBO Zone, which was the only HBO multiplex channel to feature pornographic film content. Cinemax was able to carry softcore pornographic programs as well as other forms of adult content within the channel's mainstream programming in part since the FCC's [[Watershed (television)#United States|content regulations]] applied only to channels that broadcast on the [[terrestrial television|''publicly owned'' spectrum]] and not those only available on restricted-access cable networks, which had consequently taken considerably more leeway in their programming. However, by 2013, Cinemax had begun to scale back this content, with network executives wanting the service to focus more on its original programming as a point of differentiation. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' noted the ubiquity of [[internet porn]], and that by modern standards, the softcore content was \"tame by comparison to some of what can be seen in originals on HBO and other pay TV channels.\"<ref name=\"Stealth\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-10-14/goodnight-skinemax-the-death-of-soft-core-porn|title=Goodnight, Skinemax: The Death of Soft-Core Porn|last=Grobart|first=Sam|work=Bloomberg|date=October 14, 2013|accessdate=August 1, 2017}} {{subscription required}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://theweek.com/articles/458896/demise-cinemax-after-dark-how-internet-killed-softcore-porn|title=The demise of Cinemax After Dark: How the internet killed softcore porn|last=Shire|first=Emily|work=The Week|date=October 15, 2013|accessdate=August 1, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/biz/news/cinemax-has-become-uncomfortable-in-its-skin-1200703748/|title=Cinemax Has Become Uncomfortable in Its Skin|last=Steinberg|first=Brian|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=October 8, 2013|accessdate=August 1, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://screencrush.com/rip-skinemax/|title=RIP Skinemax: Cinemax Looking to Ditch \"After Dark\" Softcore Porn|last=Sampson|first=Mike|work=ScreenCrush.com|date=October 9, 2013|accessdate=August 1, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/12/cinemax-returns-action-drama-series-co-productions-new-programming-strategy-strike-back-rellik-outcast-warrior-1201864870/|title=Cinemax Returns To Action, Pulpy Series & Co-Prods In New Programming Strategy|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=December 9, 2016|accessdate=August 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.cinemax.com}}\n\n{{Cinemax}}\n{{U.S. movie television channels}}\n{{U.S. premium television services}}\n{{WarnerMedia Entertainment}}\n\n[[Category:Cinemax| ]]\n[[Category:HBO]]\n[[Category:WarnerMedia networks]]\n[[Category:Commercial-free television networks in the United States]]\n[[Category:Movie channels in the United States]]\n[[Category:English-language television stations in the United States]]\n[[Category:Entertainment companies based in New York City]]\n[[Category:Peabody Award winners]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1980]]\n[[Category:1980 establishments in New York (state)]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the American premium channel|the India cinema chain|CineMAX}}\n{{Infobox television channel\n| name              = Cinemax\n| logofile          = Cinemax (Yellow).svg\n| logosize          = 250px\n| logocaption       = \n| logo2             = \n| launch            = {{Start date and age|1980|8|1}}\n| closed date       = \n| owner             = [[HBO|Home Box Office, Inc.]] {{small|([[WarnerMedia#WarnerMedia Entertainment|WarnerMedia Entertainment]])}} \n| picture format    = {{Plainlist|\n* [[1080i]] ([[High-definition television|HDTV]])\n* [[480i]]  ([[Standard-definition television|SDTV]])\n}}\n| country           = [[United States]]\n| language          = {{Plainlist|\n* [[English language|English]]\n* [[Spanish language|Spanish]] {{small|(Cinem\u00e1x only and via [[Second audio program|SAP]] audio track on primary Cinemax channel and all other multiplex channels;

Cinemax was originally owned by [[Time Inc.|Time-Life Inc.]], which later merged with Warner Communications in 1989 to form the present-day WarnerMedia (formerly called Time Warner).\n\nUnlike HBO \u2013 and most [[cable network|cable]] and broadcast channels already on the air at the time of its launch \u2013 Cinemax had broadcast a 24-hour-a-day schedule from its sign-on (HBO ran only nine hours of programming a day from 3:00&nbsp;p.m. to midnight [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] until September 1981, when it adopted a 24-hour weekend schedule that ran until midnight Eastern Time on Sunday nights; it implemented the round-the-clock schedule on weekdays as well on December 28 of that year). On-air spokesman [[Robert Culp]] told viewers that Cinemax would be about movies, and nothing but movies. At the time, HBO featured a wider range of programming, including some entertainment news interstitials, [[documentary film|documentaries]], children's programming, sporting events and [[television special]]s (in the form of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] plays, [[stand-up comedy]] acts and [[concert]]s). Movie classics were a mainstay of Cinemax at its birth, presented \"all uncut and commercial-free\" as Culp said on-air. A heavy schedule of films from the 1950s to the 1970s made up most of the channel's program schedule.\n\nCinemax succeeded in its early years because cable television subscribers typically had access to only about three dozen channels due to system [[cable television headend|headends]] at the time of Cinemax's debut being capable of carrying only a [[channel capacity|limited number of channels]]. Movies were the most sought-after program category among cable subscribers at the time, and that Cinemax would show classic films without commercial interruptions and editing for time and content made the channel an attractive add-on for HBO subscribers. In many cases, cable providers would not sell Cinemax to customers who did not already have a subscription to HBO. The two channels were typically sold as a package, and were usually offered at a discount for subscribers that chose to get both channels. The typical pricing for a monthly subscription to HBO in the early 1980s was US$12.95 per month, while Cinemax typically could be added for between US$7 and $10 extra per month.\n\nIn 1983, Time-Life Inc. filed a federal [[trademark infringement]] lawsuit against [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] [[KOKI-TV]] (now a [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate) in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]], [[Oklahoma]] and its owners Tulsa 23, Ltd. over the use of the slogan \"We Are Your Movie Star\", which both the [[television station]] and Cinemax were using as their slogans at that time; the suit went into proceedings in an Oklahoma [[Federal District Court]], Cinemax lost the case. As additional movie-oriented channels launched on cable television, Cinemax began to change its programming philosophy in order to maintain its subscriber base. First, the channel opted to schedule R-rated movies during daytime slots (HBO would only show R-rated movies during the nighttime hours, after 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time, a policy that network largely continues to adhere to {{as of|2015|lc=y}}); Cinemax then decided it could compete by airing more [[softcore pornography|adult-oriented movies]] that contained [[nudity]] and depictions of [[sexual intercourse]], launching the weekly \"Friday After Dark\" late-night block in 1984 (which also featured the short-lived adult drama ''Scandals'', and a series of [[anthology series|anthology specials]] under the ''Eros America'' and ''Eros International'' banners).\n\nDuring the network's first decade on the air, Cinemax had also aired some original music programming: during the mid-to-late 1980s, upon the meteoric rise in popularity of [[MTV]], Cinemax began airing [[music video]]s in the form of an [[Interstitial program|interstitial]] that ran during extended breaks between films called ''MaxTrax''; it also ran music specials under the banner ''Cinemax Sessions''<ref>{{cite web|title='Fats Domino and Friends' on Cable|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/31/arts/fats-domino-and-friends-on-cable.html|last=Pareles|first=Jon|work=The New York Times|date=July 31, 1986|accessdate=August 20, 2017}}</ref> as well as the music interview and performance series ''Album Flash'' during that same time period. The mid- and late-1980s also saw the addition of a limited amount of series programming onto Cinemax's schedule including the [[sketch comedy]] series ''[[Second City Television]]'' (whose U.S. broadcast rights were acquired by the channel from [[NBC]] in 1983) and the [[science fiction]] series ''[[Max Headroom (TV series)|Max Headroom]]'' (which had also aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from 1987 to 1988). Comedy specials were also occasionally broadcast on the channel during the late 1980s, under the ''[[Cinemax Comedy Experiment]]'' banner, featuring free-form [[sketch comedy|sketch]] and [[improvisational comedy|improvisational]] styles from various rising and established [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comics]] (such as [[Howie Mandel]], [[Chris Elliott]] and [[Eric Bogosian]]). Although its programming had diversified, Cinemax had foremost remained a movie channel. In February 1988, the network premiere broadcast of the 1987 action-comedy ''[[Lethal Weapon]]'' became the highest rated telecast in Cinemax's history at that time, averaging a 16.9 rating and 26 share.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cinemax shows strength as it turns 10|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-8934460.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105130814/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-8934460.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 5, 2012|last=Mitchell|first=Kim|work=[[MultiChannel News]]|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=September 3, 1990}}</ref>\n\nBy 1990, Cinemax limited its programming lineup mainly to movies. However starting in 1992, Cinemax re-entered into television series development with the addition of adult-oriented scripted series similar in content to the softcore pornographic films featured on the channel in late night (such as the network's first original adult series ''Erotic Confessions'', and later series entries such as ''Hot Line'', ''[[Passion Cove]]'', ''[[Lingerie (TV series)|Lingerie]]'' and ''[[Co-Ed Confidential]]''), marking a return to adult series for the channel.\n\nFrom 1992 to 1997, Cinemax aired daily movie showcases in set timeslots, centering on a certain genre which differed each day of the week; with the introduction of a new on-air presentation package in 1993, the genre of a given showcase was represented by various [[pictogram]]s that usually appeared within a specialized feature presentation bumper before the start of the movie;<ref name=\"Cinemax makeover\">{{cite web|title=Little brother Cinemax gets extensive makeover|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-13619333.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105130753/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-13619333.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 5, 2012|last=Granger|first=Rod|work=MultiChannel News|via=HighBeam Research|date=November 2, 1992|accessdate=August 20, 2017}}</ref> the symbols included: \"Comedy\" (represented by an abstract face made up of various movie props, with an open mouth made to appear like it is laughing),<ref>{{cite web|title=Cinemax Monday Comedy Movie Intro|url=http://www.gatasi.com/video/ba9Ti7VboiY/cinemax-monday-comedy.html|work=Gatasi|accessdate=August 20, 2017}}</ref> \"Suspense\" (represented by a running man silhouette within a jagged film strip), \"Premiere\" (represented by an [[exclamation mark]] immersed in spotlights), \"Horror\" (represented by a skull augmented with a devil horn and a gear-shaped eye, overlaid in front on a [[casket]]), \"Drama\" (represented by abstract comedy and tragedy masks),<ref>{{YouTube|title=Cinemax Drama Intro|id=uu7SZ-xfDrU}}</ref> \"Vanguard\" (represented by a [[globe]] overlaid on a film strip), \"Action\" (represented by a [[machine gun]] and an explosion) and \"Classic\" (represented by a classic movie-era couple embracing and kissing).

Programs that aired under the Max After Dark banner carried either a TV-MA or R rating (usually the former), primarily for [[sexual intercourse|strong sexual content]] and [[nudity]]. The block had often been the subject of both scrutiny in the media and a source of humor in [[popular culture]], with references to Cinemax's late night programming being featured in various films and television shows. Because of the block's presence, Cinemax was most commonly given the jocular nickname, \"Skinemax\".<ref name=skinemax>{{cite web|title='70's soft-core brought safe sex to cinemas|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston-sub/doc/404992424.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=&type=current&date=Feb%2019,%202006&author=&pub=&edition=&startpage=&desc=|last=Burr|first=Ty|authorlink=Ty Burr|work=[[Boston Globe]]|date=February 19, 2006|accessdate=August 1, 2017}}</ref> The network itself had acknowledged this by using a play on this term for its 2011 documentary series, ''Skin to the Max''. The late night adult series that aired first-run episodes were ''[[Lingerie (TV series)|Lingerie]]'', ''[[Life on Top]]'', ''[[Femme Fatales (TV series)|Femme Fatales]]'', ''[[Zane\u2019s The Jump Off]]'', ''Working Girls in Bed'' and ''Topless Prophet'' (which debuted on May 30, 2014 as the network's first [[reality television|reality series]] and followed the world of [[exotic dancing]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]).<ref>{{cite web|title='Topless Prophet:' The Latest Detroit Entry in the TV World|url=http://www.deadlinedetroit.com/articles/9542/topless_prophet_the_latest_detroit_entry_in_the_tv_world|last=Lengel|first=Allan|work=Deadline Detroit|date=June 9, 2014|accessdate=August 1, 2017}}</ref> Adult films often aired alongside these series, though this depended on the Cinemax multiplex channel and sometimes depending on that night's Max After Dark schedule on each channel. The block originally debuted on May 4, 1984, as a weekly block called \"Cinemax Friday After Dark\"; these adult programs eventually expanded to seven-night-a-week airings by the late 1990s. Cinemax maintained an on-air policy \u2013 that had been in effect since 1993 \u2013 not to air any adult programming on its main channel before 11:30&nbsp;p.m. ET.<ref name=\"Cinemax makeover\"/> \n\nThe adult programming featured on Max After Dark was not limited solely to the main Cinemax channel: MoreMax also aired softcore pornographic films and series, sometimes airing earlier (10:30&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time at the earliest) than the main Cinemax channel would allow; ActionMax, ThrillerMax and OuterMax also featured adult films on their late night schedules, even though the softcore adult films and series did not necessarily fit the respective formats of these multiplex services. Conversely, MovieMax (which is aimed at families) and 5StarMax (which carries a format of largely critically acclaimed, mainstream feature films) generally do not run any adult programs because of their respective programming formats. Some of the adult films featured on the Max After Dark block also aired late nights on sister channel HBO Zone, which was the only HBO multiplex channel to feature pornographic film content. Cinemax was able to carry softcore pornographic programs as well as other forms of adult content within the channel's mainstream programming in part since the FCC's [[Watershed (television)#United States|content regulations]] applied only to channels that broadcast on the [[terrestrial television|''publicly owned'' spectrum]] and not those only available on restricted-access cable networks, which had consequently taken considerably more leeway in their programming. However, by 2013, Cinemax had begun to scale back this content, with network executives wanting the service to focus more on its original programming as a point of differentiation. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' noted the ubiquity of [[internet porn]], and that by modern standards, the softcore content was \"tame by comparison to some of what can be seen in originals on HBO and other pay TV channels.\"<ref name=\"Stealth\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-10-14/goodnight-skinemax-the-death-of-soft-core-porn|title=Goodnight, Skinemax: The Death of Soft-Core Porn|last=Grobart|first=Sam|work=Bloomberg|date=October 14, 2013|accessdate=August 1, 2017}} {{subscription required}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://theweek.com/articles/458896/demise-cinemax-after-dark-how-internet-killed-softcore-porn|title=The demise of Cinemax After Dark: How the internet killed softcore porn|last=Shire|first=Emily|work=The Week|date=October 15, 2013|accessdate=August 1, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/biz/news/cinemax-has-become-uncomfortable-in-its-skin-1200703748/|title=Cinemax Has Become Uncomfortable in Its Skin|last=Steinberg|first=Brian|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=October 8, 2013|accessdate=August 1, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://screencrush.com/rip-skinemax/|title=RIP Skinemax: Cinemax Looking to Ditch \"After Dark\" Softcore Porn|last=Sampson|first=Mike|work=ScreenCrush.com|date=October 9, 2013|accessdate=August 1, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/12/cinemax-returns-action-drama-series-co-productions-new-programming-strategy-strike-back-rellik-outcast-warrior-1201864870/|title=Cinemax Returns To Action, Pulpy Series & Co-Prods In New Programming Strategy|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=December 9, 2016|accessdate=August 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.cinemax.com}}\n\n{{Cinemax}}\n{{U.S. movie television channels}}\n{{U.S. premium television services}}\n{{WarnerMedia Entertainment}}\n\n[[Category:Cinemax| ]]\n[[Category:HBO]]\n[[Category:WarnerMedia networks]]\n[[Category:Commercial-free television networks in the United States]]\n[[Category:Movie channels in the United States]]\n[[Category:English-language television stations in the United States]]\n[[Category:Entertainment companies based in New York City]]\n[[Category:Peabody Award winners]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1980]]\n[[Category:1980 establishments in New York (state)]]\n", "name_user": "1.64.115.142", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinemax"}

These were, in addition to Catalan schoolchildren who were fortunate enough to stay in their school, refugees from Madrid who had witnessed tragic events. The Brauners made a pedo-psychiatric analysis of the child's drawing, a privileged mode of graphic expression of the young child, highlighting what seems to them characteristic of the child's drawing in the war, taking notes, creating medical records and questionnaires.
