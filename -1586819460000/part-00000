For this reason, maintaining circulation is vital to moving oxygen to the tissues and carbon dioxide out of the body.\n\nAirway, breathing, and circulation, therefore work in a cascade; if the patient's [[airway]] is blocked, [[breath]]ing will not be possible, and [[oxygen]] cannot reach the [[lungs]] and be transported around the body in the [[blood]], which will result in hypoxia and cardiac arrest. Ensuring a clear airway is therefore the first step in treating any patient; once it is established that a patient's airway is clear, rescuers must evaluate a patient's breathing, as many other things besides a blockage of the airway could lead to an absence of breathing.\n\n===CPR===\nThe basic application of the ABC principle is in [[first aid]], and is used in cases of [[unconsciousness|unconscious]] patients to start treatment and assess the need for, and then potentially deliver, [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]].\n\nIn this simple usage, the rescuer is required to open the [[airway]] (using a technique such as ''\"head tilt - chin lift\"''), then check for normal [[breath]]ing.<ref name=rsukbls/>  These two steps should provide the initial assessment of whether the patient will require CPR or not.\n\nIn the event that the patient is not breathing normally, the current international guidelines (set by the [[International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation]] or ILCOR) indicate that chest compressions should be started.\n\nPreviously, the guidelines indicated that a pulse check should be performed after the breathing was assessed, and this made up the 'circulation' part of the initialism, but this pulse check is no longer recommended for lay rescuers.  Some trainers continue to use circulation as the label for the third step in the process, since performing chest compressions is effectively artificial circulation, and when assessing patients who are breathing, assessing 'circulation' is still important.  However, some trainers now use the C to mean Compressions in their basic first aid training.\n\n== Airway ==\n{{main article|airway management}}\n\n=== Unconscious patients ===\nIn the unconscious patient, the priority is [[airway management]], to avoid a preventable cause of [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].  Common problems with the airway of patient with a seriously reduced level of consciousness involve blockage of the [[human pharynx|pharynx]] by the [[tongue]], a [[foreign body]], or [[vomiting|vomit]].\n\nAt a basic level, opening of the airway is achieved through manual movement of the head using [[basic airway management|various techniques]], with the most widely taught and used being the \"head tilt \u2014 chin lift\", although other methods such as the \"modified [[jaw thrust]]\" can be used, especially where spinal injury is suspected,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.parasolemt.com.au/manual.php?subpage=airwaymanagement|title=Airway Management|accessdate=2008-12-19| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021030909/http://www.parasolemt.com.au/manual.php?subpage=airwaymanagement| archivedate= 21 October 2008| url-status= dead}}</ref> although in some countries, its use is not recommended for lay rescuers for safety reasons.<ref name=rsukbls>{{cite journal|url=http://www.resus.org.uk/pages/bls.pdf|title=Adult Basic Life Support|journal=Resuscitation UK Guidelines|publisher=Resuscitaton Council (UK)|page=14|accessdate=2008-12-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051202034805/http://www.resus.org.uk/pages/bls.pdf|archivedate=2 December 2005}}</ref>\n\nHigher level practitioners such as [[emergency medical service]] personnel may use more [[invasive airway management|advanced techniques]], from [[oropharyngeal airway]]s to [[intubation]], as deemed necessary.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Grande, Christopher M. |author2=S\u00f8reide, Eldar |title=Prehospital trauma care |publisher=Marcel Dekker |location=New York, N.Y |year=2001 |pages=211 |isbn=978-0-8247-0537-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n===Conscious patients===\nIn the conscious patient, other signs of airway obstruction that may be considered by the rescuer include paradoxical chest movements, use of accessory muscles for breathing, tracheal deviation, noisy air entry or exit, and [[cyanosis]].<ref name=rsukils>{{cite book|title=Immediate Life Support|publisher=Resuscitation Council(UK)|author1=Soar, J |author2=Nolan, J|author3= Perkins, G|author4= Scott, M|author5= Goodman, N|author6= Mitchell, S|year=2006|isbn=978-1-903812-12-9}}</ref>\n\n== Breathing ==\n\n===Unconscious patients===\nIn the unconscious patient, after the airway is opened the next area to assess is the patient's breathing,<ref name=rsukbls/> primarily to find if the patient is making normal respiratory efforts.

This can be performed peripherally, usually on a fingernail bed, or centrally, usually on the sternum or forehead\n* Pulse checks, both centrally and peripherally, assessing rate (normally 60-80 beats per minute in a resting adult), regularity, strength, and equality between different pulses\n* Blood pressure measurements can be taken to assess for signs of shock\n* Auscultation of the heart can be undertaken by medical professionals\n* Observation for secondary signs of circulatory failure such as edema or frothing from the mouth (indicative of congestive heart failure)\n* ECG monitoring will allow the healthcare professional to help diagnose underlying heart conditions, including [[myocardial infractions]]\n\n== Variations ==\nNearly all first aid organisations use \"ABC\" in some form, but some incorporate it as part of a larger initialism, ranging from the simple 'ABCD' (designed for training lay responders in defibrillation) to 'AcBCDEEEFG'{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} (the UK ambulance service version for patient assessment).\n\n===ABCD===\nThere are several protocols taught which add a D to the end of the simpler ABC (or DR ABC).

For this reason, maintaining circulation is vital to moving oxygen to the tissues and carbon dioxide out of the body.\n\nAirway, breathing, and circulation, therefore work in a cascade; if the patient's [[airway]] is blocked, [[breath]]ing will not be possible, and [[oxygen]] cannot reach the [[lungs]] and be transported around the body in the [[blood]], which will result in hypoxia and cardiac arrest. Ensuring a clear airway is therefore the first step in treating any patient; once it is established that a patient's airway is clear, rescuers must evaluate a patient's breathing, as many other things besides a blockage of the airway could lead to an absence of breathing.\n\n===CPR===\nThe basic application of the ABC principle is in [[first aid]], and is used in cases of [[unconsciousness|unconscious]] patients to start treatment and assess the need for, and then potentially deliver, [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]].\n\nIn this simple usage, the rescuer is required to open the [[airway]] (using a technique such as ''\"head tilt - chin lift\"''), then check for normal [[breath]]ing.<ref name=rsukbls/>  These two steps should provide the initial assessment of whether the patient will require CPR or not.\n\nIn the event that the patient is not breathing normally, the current international guidelines (set by the [[International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation]] or ILCOR) indicate that chest compressions should be started.\n\nPreviously, the guidelines indicated that a pulse check should be performed after the breathing was assessed, and this made up the 'circulation' part of the initialism, but this pulse check is no longer recommended for lay rescuers.  Some trainers continue to use circulation as the label for the third step in the process, since performing chest compressions is effectively artificial circulation, and when assessing patients who are breathing, assessing 'circulation' is still important.  However, some trainers now use the C to mean Compressions in their basic first aid training.\n\n== Airway ==\n{{main article|airway management}}\n\n=== Unconscious patients ===\nIn the unconscious patient, the priority is [[airway management]], to avoid a preventable cause of [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].  Common problems with the airway of patient with a seriously reduced level of consciousness involve blockage of the [[human pharynx|pharynx]] by the [[tongue]], a [[foreign body]], or [[vomiting|vomit]].\n\nAt a basic level, opening of the airway is achieved through manual movement of the head using [[basic airway management|various techniques]], with the most widely taught and used being the \"head tilt \u2014 chin lift\", although other methods such as the \"modified [[jaw thrust]]\" can be used, especially where spinal injury is suspected,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.parasolemt.com.au/manual.php?subpage=airwaymanagement|title=Airway Management|accessdate=2008-12-19| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021030909/http://www.parasolemt.com.au/manual.php?subpage=airwaymanagement| archivedate= 21 October 2008| url-status= dead}}</ref> although in some countries, its use is not recommended for lay rescuers for safety reasons.<ref name=rsukbls>{{cite journal|url=http://www.resus.org.uk/pages/bls.pdf|title=Adult Basic Life Support|journal=Resuscitation UK Guidelines|publisher=Resuscitaton Council (UK)|page=14|accessdate=2008-12-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051202034805/http://www.resus.org.uk/pages/bls.pdf|archivedate=2 December 2005}}</ref>\n\nHigher level practitioners such as [[emergency medical service]] personnel may use more [[invasive airway management|advanced techniques]], from [[oropharyngeal airway]]s to [[intubation]], as deemed necessary.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Grande, Christopher M. |author2=S\u00f8reide, Eldar |title=Prehospital trauma care |publisher=Marcel Dekker |location=New York, N.Y |year=2001 |pages=211 |isbn=978-0-8247-0537-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n===Conscious patients===\nIn the conscious patient, other signs of airway obstruction that may be considered by the rescuer include paradoxical chest movements, use of accessory muscles for breathing, tracheal deviation, noisy air entry or exit, and [[cyanosis]].<ref name=rsukils>{{cite book|title=Immediate Life Support|publisher=Resuscitation Council(UK)|author1=Soar, J |author2=Nolan, J|author3= Perkins, G|author4= Scott, M|author5= Goodman, N|author6= Mitchell, S|year=2006|isbn=978-1-903812-12-9}}</ref>\n\n== Breathing ==\n\n===Unconscious patients===\nIn the unconscious patient, after the airway is opened the next area to assess is the patient's breathing,<ref name=rsukbls/> primarily to find if the patient is making normal respiratory efforts.

{"title_page": "Partial trace", "text_new": "{{Unreferenced|date=July 2009}}\n[[File:Partial Trace.svg|thumb|right|Left hand side shows a full density matrix <math>\\rho_{AB}</math> of a bipartite qubit system. The partial trace is performed over a subsystem of 2 by 2 dimension (single qubit density matrix). The right hand side shows the resulting 2 by 2 reduced density matrix <math>\\rho_{A}</math>.]]\nIn [[linear algebra]] and [[functional analysis]], the '''partial trace''' is a generalization of the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]].  Whereas the trace is a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] valued function on operators, the partial trace is an [[operator (mathematics)|operator]]-valued function.  The partial trace has applications in [[quantum information]] and [[decoherence]] which is relevant for [[quantum measurement]] and thereby to the decoherent approaches to [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]], including [[consistent histories]] and the [[relative state interpretation]].\n\n== Details ==\nSuppose <math>V</math>, <math>W</math> are finite-dimensional vector spaces over a [[field (mathematics)|field]], with [[dimension]]s <math>m</math> and <math>n</math>, respectively. For any space <math>A</math>, let <math>L(A)</math> denote the space of [[linear operators]] on <math>A</math>. The partial trace over <math>W</math>, <math>\\operatorname{Tr}_W: \\operatorname{L}(V \\otimes W) \\to \\operatorname{L}(V)</math>, is a mapping\n\n:<math> T \\in \\operatorname{L}(V \\otimes W) \\mapsto \\operatorname{Tr}_W (T) \\in \\operatorname{L}(V)</math>\n\nIt is defined as follows: \nlet  <math>e_1, \\ldots, e_m </math>,  and <math>f_1, \\ldots, f_n </math>, be bases for ''V'' and ''W'' respectively; then ''T''\nhas a matrix representation\n\n:<math> \\{a_{k \\ell, i j}\\}  \\quad 1 \\leq k, i \\leq m, \\quad 1 \\leq \\ell,j \\leq n </math>\n\nrelative to the basis  <math> e_k \\otimes f_\\ell </math>  of  <math> V \\otimes W</math>.\n\nNow for indices ''k'', ''i'' in the range 1, ..., ''m'', consider the sum\n:<math> b_{k, i} = \\sum_{j=1}^n a_{k j, i j}. </math>\n\nThis gives a matrix ''b''<sub>''k'', ''i''</sub>. The associated linear operator on ''V'' is independent of the choice of bases and is by definition the '''partial trace'''.\n\nAmong physicists, this is often called \"tracing out\" or \"tracing over\" ''W'' to leave only an operator on ''V'' in the context where ''W'' and ''V'' are Hilbert spaces associated with quantum systems (see below).\n\n=== Invariant definition ===\nThe partial trace operator can be defined invariantly (that is, without reference to a basis) as follows: it is the unique linear operator \n:<math> \\operatorname{Tr}_W: \\operatorname{L}(V \\otimes W) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{L}(V) </math> \nsuch that\n:<math> \\operatorname{Tr}_W(R \\otimes S) = R \\, \\operatorname{Tr}(S) \\quad \\forall R \\in \\operatorname{L}(V) \\quad \\forall S \\in \\operatorname{L}(W). </math>\nTo see that the conditions above determine the partial trace uniquely, let <math>v_1, \\ldots, v_m</math> form a basis for <math>V</math>, let <math>w_1, \\ldots, w_n</math> form a basis for <math>W</math>, let <math>E_{ij} \\colon V \\to V</math> be the map that sends <math>v_i</math> to <math>v_j</math> (and all other basis elements to zero), and let <math>F_{kl} \\colon W \\to W</math> be the map that sends <math>w_k</math> to <math>w_l</math>. Since the vectors <math>v_i \\otimes w_k</math> form a basis for <math>V \\otimes W</math>, the maps <math>E_{ij} \\otimes F_{kl}</math> form a basis for <math>\\operatorname{L}(V \\otimes W)</math>.\n\nFrom this abstract definition, the following properties follow:\n\n:<math> \\operatorname{Tr}_W (I_{V \\otimes W}) = \\dim W \\ I_{V} </math>\n\n:<math> \\operatorname{Tr}_W (T (I_V \\otimes S)) = \\operatorname{Tr}_W ((I_V \\otimes S) T) \\quad \\forall S \\in \\operatorname{L}(W) \\quad \\forall T \\in \\operatorname{L}(V \\otimes W).</math>\n\n===Category theoretic notion===\n\nIt is the partial trace of linear transformations that is the subject of Joyal, Street, and Verity's notion of [[Traced monoidal category]]. A traced monoidal category is a monoidal category <math>(C,\\otimes,I)</math> together with, for objects ''X, Y, U'' in the category, a function of Hom-sets,\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Tr}^U_{X,Y}\\colon \\operatorname{Hom}_C(X\\otimes U, Y\\otimes U) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_C(X,Y)</math>\nsatisfying certain axioms.\n\nAnother case of this abstract notion of partial trace takes place in the category of finite sets and bijections between them, in which the monoidal product is disjoint union. One can show that for any finite sets, ''X,Y,U'' and bijection <math>X+U\\cong Y+U</math> there exists a corresponding \"partially traced\" bijection <math>X\\cong Y</math>.\n\n== Partial trace for operators on Hilbert spaces ==\n\nThe partial trace generalizes to operators on infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. Suppose ''V'', ''W'' are Hilbert spaces, and \nlet\n\n:<math> \\{f_i\\}_{i \\in I} </math>\n\nbe an [[orthonormal basis]] for ''W''.  Now there is an isometric isomorphism\n\n:<math>  \\bigoplus_{\\ell \\in I} (V \\otimes \\mathbb{C}   f_\\ell) \\rightarrow V \\otimes W</math>\n\nUnder this decomposition, any operator <math> T \\in \\operatorname{L}(V \\otimes W)</math> can be regarded as an infinite matrix\nof operators on ''V''\n\n:<math> \\begin{bmatrix} T_{11} & T_{12} & \\ldots & T_{1 j} & \\ldots \\\\\n                        T_{21} & T_{22} & \\ldots & T_{2 j} & \\ldots \\\\\n                         \\vdots & \\vdots & & \\vdots \\\\\n                        T_{k1}& T_{k2} & \\ldots & T_{k j} & \\ldots \\\\\n                        \\vdots  & \\vdots & & \\vdots \n\\end{bmatrix},</math>\n\nwhere <math> T_{k \\ell} \\in \\operatorname{L}(V) </math>.\n\nFirst suppose ''T'' is a non-negative operator. In this case, all the diagonal entries of the above matrix are non-negative operators on ''V''.  If the sum\n\n:<math> \\sum_{\\ell} T_{\\ell \\ell} </math>\n\nconverges in the [[strong operator topology]] of L(''V''), it is independent of the chosen basis of ''W''.  The partial trace Tr<sub>''W''</sub>(''T'') is defined to be this operator.  The partial trace of a self-adjoint operator is defined if and only if the partial traces of the positive and negative parts are defined.\n\n=== Computing the partial trace ===\n\nSuppose ''W'' has an orthonormal basis, which we denote by [[bra-ket|ket]] vector notation as <math> \\{| \\ell \\rangle\\}_\\ell </math>.  Then\n\n:<math> \\operatorname{Tr}_W\\left(\\sum_{k,\\ell} T^{(k \\ell)} \\, \\otimes \\, | k \\rangle \\langle \\ell |\\right) = \\sum_j T^{(j j)} .</math>\n\nThe superscripts in parentheses do not represent matrix components, but instead label the matrix itself.\n\n== Partial trace and invariant integration ==\n\nIn the case of finite dimensional Hilbert spaces, there is a useful way of looking at partial trace involving integration with respect to a suitably normalized Haar measure \u03bc over the unitary group U(''W'') of ''W''. Suitably normalized means that \u03bc is taken to be a measure with total mass dim(''W'').\n\n'''Theorem'''. Suppose ''V'', ''W'' are finite dimensional Hilbert spaces.  Then\n\n:<math> \\int_{\\operatorname{U}(W)} (I_V \\otimes U^*) T (I_V \\otimes U) \\ d \\mu(U) </math>\n\ncommutes with all operators of the form <math> I_V \\otimes S </math> and hence is uniquely of the form <math> R \\otimes I_W </math>. The operator ''R'' is the partial trace of ''T''.\n\n== Partial trace as a quantum operation ==\n\nThe partial trace can be viewed as a [[quantum operation]]. Consider a quantum mechanical system whose state space is the tensor product <math>H_A \\otimes H_B</math> of Hilbert spaces. A mixed state is described by a [[density matrix]] \u03c1, that is \na non-negative trace-class operator of trace 1 on the tensor product <math> H_A \\otimes H_B .</math>\nThe partial trace of \u03c1 with respect to the system ''B'', denoted by <math>\\rho ^A</math>, is called the reduced state of \u03c1 on system ''A''. In symbols,\n\n:<math>\\rho^A = \\operatorname{Tr}_B \\rho.</math>\n\nTo show that this is indeed a sensible way to assign a state on the ''A'' subsystem to \u03c1, we offer the following justification. Let ''M'' be an observable on the subsystem ''A'', then the corresponding observable on the composite system is <math>M \\otimes I</math>. However one chooses to define a reduced state <math>\\rho^A</math>, there should be consistency of measurement statistics. The expectation value of ''M'' after the subsystem ''A'' is prepared in <math>\\rho ^A</math> and that of <math>M \\otimes I</math> when the composite system is prepared in \u03c1 should be the same, i.e. the following equality should hold:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Tr} ( M \\cdot \\rho^A) = \\operatorname{Tr} ( M \\otimes I \\cdot \\rho).</math>\n\nWe see that this is satisfied if <math>\\rho ^A</math> is as defined above via the partial trace. Furthermore, such operation is unique.\n\nLet ''T(H)'' be the [[Banach space]] of trace-class operators on the Hilbert space ''H''. It can be easily checked that the partial trace, viewed as a map \n:<math>\\operatorname{Tr}_B : T(H_A \\otimes H_B) \\rightarrow T(H_A)</math>\nis completely positive and trace-preserving.\n\nThe partial trace map as given above induces a dual map <math>\\operatorname{Tr}_B ^*</math> between the [[C*-algebra]]s of bounded operators on <math>\\; H_A</math> and <math>H_A \\otimes H_B</math> given by\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Tr}_B ^* (A) = A \\otimes I.</math>\n\n<math>\\operatorname{Tr}_B ^*</math> maps observables to observables and is the [[Heisenberg picture]] representation of <math>\\operatorname{Tr}_B</math>.\n\n=== Comparison with classical case ===\n\nSuppose instead of quantum mechanical systems, the two systems ''A'' and ''B'' are classical. The space of observables for each system are then abelian C*-algebras.  These are of the form ''C''(''X'') and ''C''(''Y'') respectively for compact spaces ''X'', ''Y''. The state space of the composite system is simply\n\n:<math>C(X) \\otimes C(Y) = C(X \\times Y).</math>\n\nA state on the composite system is a positive element \u03c1 of the dual of C(''X'' &times; ''Y''), which by the [[Riesz-Markov theorem]] corresponds to a regular Borel measure on ''X'' &times; ''Y''. The corresponding reduced state is obtained by projecting the measure \u03c1 to ''X''. Thus the partial trace is the quantum mechanical equivalent of this operation.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Partial Trace}}\n[[Category:Linear algebra]]\n[[Category:Functional analysis]]\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=July 2009}}\n[[File:Partial Trace.svg|thumb|right|Left hand side shows a full density matrix <math>\\rho_{AB}</math> of a bipartite qubit system. The partial trace is performed over a subsystem of 2 by 2 dimension (single qubit density matrix). The right hand side shows the resulting 2 by 2 reduced density matrix <math>\\rho_{A}</math>.]]\nIn [[linear algebra]] and [[functional analysis]], the '''partial trace''' is a generalization of the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]].  Whereas the trace is a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] valued function on operators, the partial trace is an [[operator (mathematics)|operator]]-valued function.  The partial trace has applications in [[quantum information]] and [[decoherence]] which is relevant for [[quantum measurement]] and thereby to the decoherent approaches to [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]], including [[consistent histories]] and the [[relative state interpretation]].\n\n== Details ==\nSuppose <math>V</math>, <math>W</math> are finite-dimensional vector spaces over a [[field (mathematics)|field]], with [[dimension]]s <math>m</math> and <math>n</math>, respectively. For any space <math>A</math> let <math>L(A)</math> denote the space of [[linear operators]] on <math>A</math>. The partial trace over <math>W</math>, <math>\\operatorname{Tr}_W: \\operatorname{L}(V \\otimes W) \\to \\operatorname{L}(V)</math>, is a mapping\n\n:<math> T \\in \\operatorname{L}(V \\otimes W) \\mapsto \\operatorname{Tr}_W (T) \\in \\operatorname{L}(V)</math>\n\nIt is defined as follows: \nlet  <math>e_1, \\ldots, e_m </math>,  and <math>f_1, \\ldots, f_n </math>, be bases for ''V'' and ''W'' respectively; then ''T''\nhas a matrix representation\n\n:<math> \\{a_{k \\ell, i j}\\}  \\quad 1 \\leq k, i \\leq m, \\quad 1 \\leq \\ell,j \\leq n </math>\n\nrelative to the basis  <math> e_k \\otimes f_\\ell </math>  of  <math> V \\otimes W</math>.\n\nNow for indices ''k'', ''i'' in the range 1, ..., ''m'', consider the sum\n:<math> b_{k, i} = \\sum_{j=1}^n a_{k j, i j}. </math>\n\nThis gives a matrix ''b''<sub>''k'', ''i''</sub>. The associated linear operator on ''V'' is independent of the choice of bases and is by definition the '''partial trace'''.\n\nAmong physicists, this is often called \"tracing out\" or \"tracing over\" ''W'' to leave only an operator on ''V'' in the context where ''W'' and ''V'' are Hilbert spaces associated with quantum systems (see below).\n\n=== Invariant definition ===\nThe partial trace operator can be defined invariantly (that is, without reference to a basis) as follows: it is the unique linear operator \n:<math> \\operatorname{Tr}_W: \\operatorname{L}(V \\otimes W) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{L}(V) </math> \nsuch that\n:<math> \\operatorname{Tr}_W(R \\otimes S) = R \\, \\operatorname{Tr}(S) \\quad \\forall R \\in \\operatorname{L}(V) \\quad \\forall S \\in \\operatorname{L}(W). </math>\nTo see that the conditions above determine the partial trace uniquely, let <math>v_1, \\ldots, v_m</math> form a basis for <math>V</math>, let <math>w_1, \\ldots, w_n</math> form a basis for <math>W</math>, let <math>E_{ij} \\colon V \\to V</math> be the map that sends <math>v_i</math> to <math>v_j</math> (and all other basis elements to zero), and let <math>F_{kl} \\colon W \\to W</math> be the map that sends <math>w_k</math> to <math>w_l</math>. Since the vectors <math>v_i \\otimes w_k</math> form a basis for <math>V \\otimes W</math>, the maps <math>E_{ij} \\otimes F_{kl}</math> form a basis for <math>\\operatorname{L}(V \\otimes W)</math>.\n\nFrom this abstract definition, the following properties follow:\n\n:<math> \\operatorname{Tr}_W (I_{V \\otimes W}) = \\dim W \\ I_{V} </math>\n\n:<math> \\operatorname{Tr}_W (T (I_V \\otimes S)) = \\operatorname{Tr}_W ((I_V \\otimes S) T) \\quad \\forall S \\in \\operatorname{L}(W) \\quad \\forall T \\in \\operatorname{L}(V \\otimes W).</math>\n\n===Category theoretic notion===\n\nIt is the partial trace of linear transformations that is the subject of Joyal, Street, and Verity's notion of [[Traced monoidal category]]. A traced monoidal category is a monoidal category <math>(C,\\otimes,I)</math> together with, for objects ''X, Y, U'' in the category, a function of Hom-sets,\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Tr}^U_{X,Y}\\colon \\operatorname{Hom}_C(X\\otimes U, Y\\otimes U) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_C(X,Y)</math>\nsatisfying certain axioms.\n\nAnother case of this abstract notion of partial trace takes place in the category of finite sets and bijections between them, in which the monoidal product is disjoint union. One can show that for any finite sets, ''X,Y,U'' and bijection <math>X+U\\cong Y+U</math> there exists a corresponding \"partially traced\" bijection <math>X\\cong Y</math>.\n\n== Partial trace for operators on Hilbert spaces ==\n\nThe partial trace generalizes to operators on infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. Suppose ''V'', ''W'' are Hilbert spaces, and \nlet\n\n:<math> \\{f_i\\}_{i \\in I} </math>\n\nbe an [[orthonormal basis]] for ''W''.  Now there is an isometric isomorphism\n\n:<math>  \\bigoplus_{\\ell \\in I} (V \\otimes \\mathbb{C}   f_\\ell) \\rightarrow V \\otimes W</math>\n\nUnder this decomposition, any operator <math> T \\in \\operatorname{L}(V \\otimes W)</math> can be regarded as an infinite matrix\nof operators on ''V''\n\n:<math> \\begin{bmatrix} T_{11} & T_{12} & \\ldots & T_{1 j} & \\ldots \\\\\n                        T_{21} & T_{22} & \\ldots & T_{2 j} & \\ldots \\\\\n                         \\vdots & \\vdots & & \\vdots \\\\\n                        T_{k1}& T_{k2} & \\ldots & T_{k j} & \\ldots \\\\\n                        \\vdots  & \\vdots & & \\vdots \n\\end{bmatrix},</math>\n\nwhere <math> T_{k \\ell} \\in \\operatorname{L}(V) </math>.\n\nFirst suppose ''T'' is a non-negative operator. In this case, all the diagonal entries of the above matrix are non-negative operators on ''V''.  If the sum\n\n:<math> \\sum_{\\ell} T_{\\ell \\ell} </math>\n\nconverges in the [[strong operator topology]] of L(''V''), it is independent of the chosen basis of ''W''.  The partial trace Tr<sub>''W''</sub>(''T'') is defined to be this operator.  The partial trace of a self-adjoint operator is defined if and only if the partial traces of the positive and negative parts are defined.\n\n=== Computing the partial trace ===\n\nSuppose ''W'' has an orthonormal basis, which we denote by [[bra-ket|ket]] vector notation as <math> \\{| \\ell \\rangle\\}_\\ell </math>.  Then\n\n:<math> \\operatorname{Tr}_W\\left(\\sum_{k,\\ell} T^{(k \\ell)} \\, \\otimes \\, | k \\rangle \\langle \\ell |\\right) = \\sum_j T^{(j j)} .</math>\n\nThe superscripts in parentheses do not represent matrix components, but instead label the matrix itself.\n\n== Partial trace and invariant integration ==\n\nIn the case of finite dimensional Hilbert spaces, there is a useful way of looking at partial trace involving integration with respect to a suitably normalized Haar measure \u03bc over the unitary group U(''W'') of ''W''.
