Meeting [[Tony Soprano|Tony]] at his doctor's office, he asks for more help for his medical and legal expenses, but Tony has his own expenses and angrily tells Junior to manage his affairs better. Junior later promotes [[Bobby Baccalieri]]. [[New Jersey General Assembly|Assemblyman]] [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Ronald Zellman|Ron Zellman]] tells Tony about a special Newark Development District where Junior has a property which is going to rise in value; Tony buys it, pretending that he is doing his uncle a favour. He also calls a meeting with the family's ''[[caporegime|capos]]'' in which he harangues them about the zero growth in business.\n\n[[Carmela Soprano|Carmela]] is worried about money, having seen the widowed [[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Angie Bonpensiero|Angie Bonpensiero]] working at a supermarket. Tony insists that, if anything happens to him, she and the children will be provided for, but will not give details. He also says money is no longer hidden in the house, but later retrieves packets of banknotes from a shed and from his car and hides them in a tub of duck feed; Carmela happens to pass by just after he closes the tub.\n\n[[Paulie Walnuts]] has been arrested in [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]], [[Ohio]] on a gun charge, and resents Tony's apparent indifference. From a jailhouse payphone, he calls [[Johnny Sack]], who is cultivating his dissatisfaction.\n\n[[Ralphie Cifaretto]] and [[Janice Soprano]] are growing closer. At a Sunday dinner at Tony and Carmela's home, Janice follows Ralphie to the bathroom and joins him for [[cocaine]] and sex\u2014 though Ralphie came with Rosalie Aprile.\n\n[[Christopher Moltisanti|Christopher]] believes that Tony is treating him harshly because he questioned his action against [[Jackie Aprile, Jr.]]. He is injecting heroin every day. [[Adriana La Cerva|Adriana]] is now close friends with Danielle, who is actually FBI Agent [[FBI on The Sopranos#Agent Deborah Ciccerone-Waldrup|Deborah Ciccerone]]. Chris complains that she is always in their home. Adriana takes her to Tony's home and introduces her to him. Junior hears that there was an FBI agent in his doctor's office. He realizes it must have been the nurse he was flirting with, and is mortified that he failed to suspect her.\n\nSpeaking to [[Jennifer Melfi|Dr. Melfi]] about business with unusual frankness, Tony says that usually, \"There's two endings for a guy like me. . . Dead or in the can.\"  But there is a third option, to rely \"on blood relations\": he will use his nephew Chris as a buffer between others and himself. As part of what he calls the bonding process, he gives Chris the name and home address of the man, a just-retired policeman, who, Tony says, killed Chris's father. Chris goes to his home and kills him.\n\n==First appearances==\n*'''[[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Robert \"Bobby\" Baccalieri III|Bobby Baccalieri, III]]''': Bobby's son\n*'''[[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Karen Baccalieri|Karen Baccalieri]]''': Bobby's wife\n*'''[[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Sophia Baccalieri|Sophia Baccalieri]]''': Bobby's daughter\n*'''[[Carlo Gervasi]]''': Soprano/DiMeo crime family capo\n*'''[[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Murf Lupo|Murf Lupo]]''': Aging former Soprano/DiMeo crime family capo and friend of Junior Soprano\n*'''Cosette''': the dog of Adriana La Cerva\n\n==Deceased==\n*'''[[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Detective Barry Haydu|Det.

Rats stopped choosing candy they preferred over other candy when it meant hurting an unfamiliar, neighbour rat. Reducing brain activity in the ACC by injecting a local anesthetic reversed this behaviour. Moreover, they showed that their harm aversion can be limited as most rats, which previously switched to the less-preferred candy to avoid harm to their neighbours, stopped doing so when offered a choice between one and three candies. Their experiments may show that the [[morality|moral]] motivation that keeps humans from harming other humans has old evolutionary origins and is shared to some degree with other animals. They also suggest some level of [[personality]] in rats as they showed a wide range of variable responses in the experiment \u2013 including indifference and not choosing any of the two levers after the first electric shock was registered.

Rats stopped choosing candy they preferred over other candy when it meant hurting an unfamiliar, neighbour rat. Reducing brain activity in the ACC by injecting a local anesthetic reversed this behaviour. Moreover, they showed that their harm aversion can be limited as most rats, which previously switched to the less-preferred candy to avoid harm to their neighbours, stopped doing so when offered a choice between one and three candies. Their experiments may show that the [[morality|moral]] motivation that keeps humans from harming other humans has old evolutionary origins and is shared to some degree with other animals. They also suggest some level of [[personality]] in rats as they showed a wide range of variable responses in the experiment \u2013 including indifference and not choosing any of the two levers after the first electric shock was registered.

In 1853, Colonel Thomas J. Nevins, San Francisco's first superintendent of schools, had broached the idea of a free high school for boys and a seminary for girls. It took three years for Nevins to convince the Board of Education that a high school was necessary, and a resolution was passed on July 10, 1856 to establish the San Francisco High School and Ladies' Seminary. Six days later, however, the resolution was rescinded on the grounds that a high school could not legally be part of the San Francisco Common Schools; opponents in the City saw no need for an education beyond the eighth grade funded on public budgets. A simple name change from the proposed San Francisco High School and Ladies' Seminary to the Union Grammar School appeased those who had opposed the creation of the school. Thus was San Francisco's first public school that provided a secondary education established.\n\nThe Union Grammar School first opened on August 25, 1856 in rented quarters at the Wesleyan Methodist Church on Powell Street, between Clay and Sacramento. By 1860, the church was purchased and reconstructed as a school at the same location. The new two-storied school building had four classrooms, an assembly room, and two rooms for gymnastic exercises and calisthenics. Dedication ceremonies for the new structure took place on September 19, 1860. The school in the new building was already referred to as the San Francisco High School because by that time, it was generally recognized that the course of study was on the secondary level.\n\nIn May 1864, the Board of Education decided to form separate schools for boys and girls. Boys remained at the same campus at the Boys' High School, while girls were moved to their own school at Bush and Stockton Streets (Girls' High School), where they would remain until the return of coeducation (in practice) in the 1880s.\n\nIn 1894, the school was renamed to honor the distinguished poet [[James Russell Lowell]], chiefly by Pelham W. Ames, a member of the school board and ardent admirer of James Russell Lowell. The school relocated in January 1913 to an entire block on Hayes Street between Ashbury and Masonic. Lowell remained there for 50 years and established its position as the city's [[University-preparatory school|college preparatory high school]]. In 1952, the school sought a new location near [[Lake Merced]] and moved there (its present address) in 1962.<ref name=\"alumni\"/>\n\nThroughout its history, Lowell has had unique and close relationships with the [[University of California]] and [[Stanford University]]. When the University of California first opened its first campus in Oakland in September 1896, Lowell (Boys' High School) began to evolve its curriculum to prepare students for the college. From its inception, the University was to have a special relationship with its unique secondary school feeder in San Francisco. Boys' High School quickly became seen as a stepping-stone to college. Of the University of California's first six graduating classes (1873-1878), over a third had attended Boys' High School. William T. Reid, the high school's fourth principal, later became the president of the University of California. Part of Lowell folklore is that Stanford took its colors and the Cardinal name from Lowell.\n\n=== ''San Francisco NAACP v. San Francisco Unified School District'' (1980s) ===\nIn 1983, the [[San Francisco Unified School District]] (SFUSD) attempted to ensure racial desegregation at Lowell and other schools by implementing a race-based admissions policy as a result of ''San Francisco NAACP v. San Francisco Unified School District'' and the 1983 Consent Decree settlement.\n\nBecause of the Consent Decree, SFUSD strived to create a more equal distribution of race at Lowell, which was predominantly [[Chinese American]], particularly trying to introduce more African American and Hispanic students into the school's population. As a result of this policy, effective in 1985, Chinese-American freshman applicants needed to score 62 out of a possible total of 69 eligibility points, whereas Caucasian and other East Asian candidates needed only 58 points.<ref>{{cite news |last=Woo |first=Elaine |date=13 July 1995 |title=COLUMN ONE : Caught on the Wrong Side of the Line? : Chinese Americans must outscore all other groups to enter elite Lowell High in San Francisco, sparking an ugly battle over diversity and the image of a 'model minority.' |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-07-13/news/mn-23543_1_chinese-americans/2 |work=Los Angeles times |access-date=8 September 2018 }}</ref>\n\n=== ''Ho v. San Francisco Unified School District'' (1990s) ===\n{{Main|Ho v. San Francisco Unified School District}}\n\nIn 1994, a group of Chinese-American community activists organized a lawsuit to challenge the 1983 Consent Decree race-based admissions policies used by SFUSD for its public schools. The lawsuit was led by Lowell alum, Lee Cheng.<ref>{{cite news |last=Har |first=Janie |agency=Associated Press |date=27 August 2018 |title=Race-based school criteria roils Asian-Americans - again |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/higher-education/race-based-school-criteria-roils-asian-americans---again/2018/08/27/39265076-a9af-11e8-9a7d-cd30504ff902_story.html?noredirect=on |work=Washington Post |location= |access-date=8 September 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, both parties agreed to a settlement which modified the 1983 Consent Decree to create a new \"diversity index\" system which substituted race as a factor for admissions with a variety of factors such as socioeconomic background, mother's educational level, academic achievement, language spoken at home, and English Learner Status.\n\n=== Expiration of the Consent Decree ===\nCritics of the diversity index created by ''Ho v. San Francisco Unified School District'' point out that many schools, including Lowell, have become even less racially diverse since it was enacted.\n\nOn November 15, 2005, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California denied a request to extend the Consent Decree, which was set to expire on December 31, 2005 after it had been extended once before to December 31, 2002. The ruling claimed \"since the settlement of the ''Ho'' litigation [resulting in the institution of the \"diversity index\"], the consent decree has proven to be ineffective, if not counterproductive, in achieving diversity in San Francisco public schools\" by making schools more racially segregated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/courses/edlaw/110805order.pdf |title=110805order.pdf |accessdate=December 30, 2007 |author=The United States District Court of the Northern District of California |format=PDF |work= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070712183508/http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/courses/edlaw/110805order.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = July 12, 2007}}</ref>\n\n== Campus ==\n[[File:LowellHighSchoolMainEntranceFromEuclyptausStreet.jpg|thumbnail|Lowell High School's Main Entrance.]]\nLowell is located north of [[Lake Merced]], south of [[San Francisco]]'s Parkside District.

Five of six department chairs and dozens of teachers at Lowell filed a union grievance demanding an end to class imbalances. Citing these imbalances, they called to eliminate arena scheduling and to replace it with computerized scheduling used in all other SFUSD schools. Critics characterized arena scheduling as an antiquated and inefficient system, one which promotes inequities and abuses, and creates weeks of unnecessary work for teachers and counselors (the system tends to produce \"incomplete\" schedules which must be dealt with after the scheduling period).<ref name=\"SFChroniclearenascheduling\">[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/03/04/BAGVIHIKD71.DTL&feed=rss.bayarea Class scheduling methods put Lowell High in a tizzy.] From the ''San Francisco Chronicle''.</ref><ref name=\"keeparenascheduling\">[http://www.thelowell.org/content/view/1562/29/ Self-scheduling is fundamental to Lowell.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927020935/http://www.thelowell.org/content/view/1562/29/ |date=2007-09-27 }} From ''The Lowell''.</ref>\n\nProponents of arena argued that the system distinguishes Lowell and gives students additional responsibility and flexibility with shaping their high school careers. Doing so, students can prepare for a similar selecting of courses in college. Students would be able to choose teachers whom they found to be compatible with their learning style. The rotating priority system of picking teachers and times would assure the fairest results for the greatest number of people.\n\nAfter a student forum, committee meetings, several student petitions, and final deliberation by then-principal Paul Cheng and the administration, it was decided that arena would remain in place, with modifications to address concerns about inequities and class imbalance, including the abolishment of early scheduling for Shield and Scroll and \"mini arena,\" which allowed people with incomplete schedules another chance to complete them by opening up all the classes again with a few slots.\n\nUnder pressure from faculty and students, in 2013 the Lowell administration decided on an \"online arena\"\u2014very different from the previous arena.<ref name=\"onlinearena\">[http://thelowell.org/2013/05/29/shift-to-online-self-scheduling-a-success Shift to online self-scheduling a success.] From ''The Lowell''.</ref> In 2012, the Lowell administration began preliminary testing by requiring students to submit their proposed classes for the next school year through an online form, designed and maintained by a few students from the computer programming classes. The preliminary trials were a success as students were able to submit their schedules into a database by means of a computerized system, saving the faculty from having to input the information themselves.

In 1853, Colonel Thomas J. Nevins, San Francisco's first superintendent of schools, had broached the idea of a free high school for boys and a seminary for girls. It took three years for Nevins to convince the Board of Education that a high school was necessary, and a resolution was passed on July 10, 1856 to establish the San Francisco High School and Ladies' Seminary. Six days later, however, the resolution was rescinded on the grounds that a high school could not legally be part of the San Francisco Common Schools; opponents in the City saw no need for an education beyond the eighth grade funded on public budgets. A simple name change from the proposed San Francisco High School and Ladies' Seminary to the Union Grammar School appeased those who had opposed the creation of the school. Thus was San Francisco's first public school that provided a secondary education established.\n\nThe Union Grammar School first opened on August 25, 1856 in rented quarters at the Wesleyan Methodist Church on Powell Street, between Clay and Sacramento. By 1860, the church was purchased and reconstructed as a school at the same location. The new two-storied school building had four classrooms, an assembly room, and two rooms for gymnastic exercises and calisthenics. Dedication ceremonies for the new structure took place on September 19, 1860. The school in the new building was already referred to as the San Francisco High School because by that time, it was generally recognized that the course of study was on the secondary level.\n\nIn May 1864, the Board of Education decided to form separate schools for boys and girls. Boys remained at the same campus at the Boys' High School, while girls were moved to their own school at Bush and Stockton Streets (Girls' High School), where they would remain until the return of coeducation (in practice) in the 1880s.\n\nIn 1894, the school was renamed to honor the distinguished poet [[James Russell Lowell]], chiefly by Pelham W. Ames, a member of the school board and ardent admirer of James Russell Lowell. The school relocated in January 1913 to an entire block on Hayes Street between Ashbury and Masonic. Lowell remained there for 50 years and established its position as the city's [[University-preparatory school|college preparatory high school]]. In 1952, the school sought a new location near [[Lake Merced]] and moved there (its present address) in 1962.<ref name=\"alumni\"/>\n\nThroughout its history, Lowell has had unique and close relationships with the [[University of California]] and [[Stanford University]]. When the University of California first opened its first campus in Oakland in September 1896, Lowell (Boys' High School) began to evolve its curriculum to prepare students for the college. From its inception, the University was to have a special relationship with its unique secondary school feeder in San Francisco. Boys' High School quickly became seen as a stepping-stone to college. Of the University of California's first six graduating classes (1873-1878), over a third had attended Boys' High School. William T. Reid, the high school's fourth principal, later became the president of the University of California. Part of Lowell folklore is that Stanford took its colors and the Cardinal name from Lowell.\n\n=== ''San Francisco NAACP v. San Francisco Unified School District'' (1980s) ===\nIn 1983, the [[San Francisco Unified School District]] (SFUSD) attempted to ensure racial desegregation at Lowell and other schools by implementing a race-based admissions policy as a result of ''San Francisco NAACP v. San Francisco Unified School District'' and the 1983 Consent Decree settlement.\n\nBecause of the Consent Decree, SFUSD strived to create a more equal distribution of race at Lowell, which was predominantly [[Chinese American]], particularly trying to introduce more African American and Hispanic students into the school's population. As a result of this policy, effective in 1985, Chinese-American freshman applicants needed to score 62 out of a possible total of 69 eligibility points, whereas Caucasian and other East Asian candidates needed only 58 points.<ref>{{cite news |last=Woo |first=Elaine |date=13 July 1995 |title=COLUMN ONE : Caught on the Wrong Side of the Line? : Chinese Americans must outscore all other groups to enter elite Lowell High in San Francisco, sparking an ugly battle over diversity and the image of a 'model minority.' |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-07-13/news/mn-23543_1_chinese-americans/2 |work=Los Angeles times |access-date=8 September 2018 }}</ref>\n\n=== ''Ho v.

San Francisco Unified School District'' point out that many schools, including Lowell, have become even less racially diverse since it was enacted.\n\nOn November 15, 2005, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California denied a request to extend the Consent Decree, which was set to expire on December 31, 2005 after it had been extended once before to December 31, 2002. The ruling claimed \"since the settlement of the ''Ho'' litigation [resulting in the institution of the \"diversity index\"], the consent decree has proven to be ineffective, if not counterproductive, in achieving diversity in San Francisco public schools\" by making schools more racially segregated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/courses/edlaw/110805order.pdf |title=110805order.pdf |accessdate=December 30, 2007 |author=The United States District Court of the Northern District of California |format=PDF |work= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070712183508/http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/courses/edlaw/110805order.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = July 12, 2007}}</ref>\n\n== Campus ==\n[[File:LowellHighSchoolMainEntranceFromEuclyptausStreet.jpg|thumbnail|Lowell High School's Main Entrance.]]\nLowell is located north of [[Lake Merced]], south of [[San Francisco]]'s Parkside District.

Five of six department chairs and dozens of teachers at Lowell filed a union grievance demanding an end to class imbalances. Citing these imbalances, they called to eliminate arena scheduling and to replace it with computerized scheduling used in all other SFUSD schools. Critics characterized arena scheduling as an antiquated and inefficient system, one which promotes inequities and abuses, and creates weeks of unnecessary work for teachers and counselors (the system tends to produce \"incomplete\" schedules which must be dealt with after the scheduling period).<ref name=\"SFChroniclearenascheduling\">[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/03/04/BAGVIHIKD71.DTL&feed=rss.bayarea Class scheduling methods put Lowell High in a tizzy.] From the ''San Francisco Chronicle''.</ref><ref name=\"keeparenascheduling\">[http://www.thelowell.org/content/view/1562/29/ Self-scheduling is fundamental to Lowell.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927020935/http://www.thelowell.org/content/view/1562/29/ |date=2007-09-27 }} From ''The Lowell''.</ref>\n\nProponents of arena argued that the system distinguishes Lowell and gives students additional responsibility and flexibility with shaping their high school careers. Doing so, students can prepare for a similar selecting of courses in college. Students would be able to choose teachers whom they found to be compatible with their learning style. The rotating priority system of picking teachers and times would assure the fairest results for the greatest number of people.\n\nAfter a student forum, committee meetings, several student petitions, and final deliberation by then-principal Paul Cheng and the administration, it was decided that arena would remain in place, with modifications to address concerns about inequities and class imbalance, including the abolishment of early scheduling for Shield and Scroll and \"mini arena,\" which allowed people with incomplete schedules another chance to complete them by opening up all the classes again with a few slots.\n\nUnder pressure from faculty and students, in 2013 the Lowell administration decided on an \"online arena\"\u2014very different from the previous arena.<ref name=\"onlinearena\">[http://thelowell.org/2013/05/29/shift-to-online-self-scheduling-a-success Shift to online self-scheduling a success.] From ''The Lowell''.</ref> In 2012, the Lowell administration began preliminary testing by requiring students to submit their proposed classes for the next school year through an online form, designed and maintained by a few students from the computer programming classes. The preliminary trials were a success as students were able to submit their schedules into a database by means of a computerized system, saving the faculty from having to input the information themselves.

These dynasties include [[Ghaznavids]] (Turkic origin rulers from Ghazni in modern-day Afghanistan), [[Ghorids]] (an Iranian origin rulers from Ghor in present-day central Afghanistan), [[khilji dynasty]] (a turco-Afghan origin dynasty from eastern and southern Afghanistan), and [[Lodhi dynasty]]. Mughal rule was briefly interrupted by the [[Sur dynasty]] before Mughals regained the power. Other Pashtuns began invading India until the [[Sikh Empire]] came to power. This formed a barrier between Afghanistan ([[Durrani Empire]]) and British India. Afghans were required visas to enter India after this period.\n\nThe Great [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] King [[Sher Shah Suri]] (Farid Khan) took control of the [[Mughal Empire]] in 1540. After his accidental death in 1545, his son [[Islam Shah]] became his successor. He first served as a private before rising to become a commander in the Mughal army under [[Babur]] and then as the governor of Bihar. In 1537, when Babur's son [[Humayun]] was elsewhere on an expedition, Sher Shah overran the state of Bengal and established the [[Sur Dynasty]]. A brilliant strategist, Sher Shah proved himself a gifted administrator as well as a capable general. His reorganization of the empire laid the foundations for the later Mughal emperors, notably Akbar the Great, son of Humayun.\nHe extended the Grand Trunk Road from Chittagong in the frontiers of the province of Bengal in near eastern India Kolkata to Kabul in Afghanistan in the far northwest of the country.\n\nDuring the 19th century many Afghans migrated to India.

Thousands of Afghan refugees that have been living in India have since become Indian citizens.<ref name=UNHCR>[http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/news/opendoc.htm?tbl=NEWS&id=441190254&page=news UNHCR]</ref><ref>[http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/page?page=49e4876d6&submit=GO 2013 UNHCR regional operations profile - South Asia]</ref>\n\nRecently, [[Adnan Sami]] became an Indian citizen on 1 January 2016. He is a Pashtun from his father [[Arshad Sami Khan]]'s side. Adnan's grandfather General Mehfooz Jan hailed from [[Herat]], [[Afghanistan]] and was the governor of four provinces in [[Afghanistan]], namely [[Herat]], [[Kabul]], [[Jalalabad]] and [[Balkh]], under the reign of King [[Amanullah Khan]]. Adnan's great-grandfather General Ahmed Jan was the military adviser to King [[Abdur Rahman Khan]]. General Ahmed Jan was the conqueror of [[Kafiristan]] and named it [[Nuristan]]. However, at the time of the [[Habibullah Kalakani]] revolution in [[Afghanistan]], Adnan's grandfather General Mehfooz Jan was assassinated. The family therefore migrated to [[Peshawar]], which was a part of [[British India]] at that time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/Adnan-Sami-Fastest-fingers-first/articleshow/37852222.cms|title=Adnan Sami: Fastest fingers first|work=The Times of India}}</ref>\n\n== Stay ==\nIndia has not signed the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|1951 Convention relating to refugees]], nor does it have any domestic legislation in place to ensure their basic rights.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-afghanistan-refugees-idUSKBN19E04V|title=Afghan women refugees resurrected as India's plastic waste warriors|date=2017-06-23|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-05-02|language=en}}</ref> Many Afghans don't have work permits in India, have trouble enrolling their children in school, and can't even get a local phone.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/tough-times-follow-afghan-refugees-fleeing-taliban-to-delhi/1146123/1|title=Tough times follow Afghan refugees fleeing Taliban to Delhi - Indian Express|website=archive.indianexpress.com|access-date=2019-05-02}}</ref> They carry blue United Nations refugee cards, and do little more than just survive.<ref name=\":0\" /> Afghans make less than their Indian counter parts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/falling-short-how-india-treats-those-seeking-refuge/story-Y96NXag08KXxzaNjkOND5M.html|title=Falling short: How India treats those seeking refuge|date=2015-09-13|website=Hindustan Times|language=en|access-date=2019-05-02}}</ref>\n\n=== Naturalisation ===\nTo be eligible for [[Naturalization|naturalisation]], a refugee must have lived in India for 12 years or have been married to an Indian for seven years.

S. Durai Senthilkumar]] and produced by [[Dhanush]], their second collaboration after ''[[Ethir Neechal (2013 film)|Ethir Neechal]]'' (2013). The film features [[Sivakarthikeyan]] and [[Sri Divya]] in the lead roles, while [[Prabhu (actor)|Prabhu]] and [[Vijay Raaz]] play supporting roles. The film's music was composed by [[Anirudh Ravichander]]. The story revolves around police constable Mathimaran who wants to prove himself as a true, powerful cop by finding ways to solve issues of corruption in the law and order system in the department of police.\n\nThe film, which commenced filming in April 2014, released on 27 February 2015. In 2018, the film was dubbed in Hindi as ''Daring Policewala''.\n\n== Plot ==\nMathimaran  ([[Sivakarthikeyan]]) is a [[police constable]] who only reports to work and goes home daily without contributing anything useful to the society as his boss, Inspector Sathyamurthy ([[Prabhu Ganesan|Prabhu]]), does not want to get on the wrong side of the upper levels of the police, who are corrupt and politically influenced, and is also unwilling to rock the present system due to past experience. Mathimaran and his fellow policemen never get any cases as a result, much to his irritation.\n\nMathimaran falls in love with Divya ([[Sri Divya]]), who works as a nurse in a hospital, but hides his occupation from her as her family hates police officers. With her help, he finds out about an illegal [[organ donation]] racket orchestrated by Durai Arasan ([[Vijay Raaz]]), a politician, and Dr. Devasagayam ([[Yog Japee]]), who is the chairman of the hospital where Divya works. They capture sick and injured migrant workers from [[North India]], make them [[brain death|brain dead]] by administering them [[carbon monoxide]] instead of [[oxygen]], and then harvest their organs, which they sell abroad for huge amounts of money. The organ donation scam gives Mathimaran his first real case, and he takes it on with enthusiasm after Sathyamurthy and Durai's estranged father Singaperumal ([[Nagineedu]]), who had threatened to expose his son's misdeeds, are killed in a bomb blast orchestrated by Durai.\n\nMathimaran first confronts Devasagayam, who commits [[suicide]], but not before admitting his role in the scam and giving detailed information about it. He then decides to confront Durai and get him arrested, but problem is that there is not enough evidence against Durai except Devasagayam's word, and Devasagayam is dead. He tries to get more information about Durai's role in the scam incognito. Unfortunately, Durai soon finds out that Mathimaran is after him, and a cat-and-mouse game begins between the two. In the process, Mathimaran is suspended from duty, as the police commissioner ([[Jeeva Ravi]]) is close to Durai. Undaunted, he manages to expose the scam and Durai's involvement in it to the media, but Durai wriggles out of arrest.\n\nMathimaran decides to finish off Durai to end the scam once and for all. He creates a ruckus during a felicitation function for Durai. In the chaos that ensues, he shoots Durai in the leg and gives him the same treatment which had been meted out to the North Indian workers: administering him carbon monoxide and then harvesting his organs after he is declared brain dead. Durai's death is covered up as a terrorist attack. Mathimaran is eventually promoted to Inspector in reward for his efforts in thwarting the organ donation scam. He also gets accepted by Divya's family, despite being a police officer, and marries Divya.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Sivakarthikeyan]] as Mathimaran Rathnavel, R5 Station Constable\n* [[Sri Divya]] as Divya, Worked as nurse in Hospital Devasagayam\n* [[Prabhu Ganesan|Prabhu]] as Sathyamurthy, R5 Station Inspector\n* [[Vijay Raaz]] as Durai Arasan, Human Trader known as businessman\n* [[Manobala]] as Jyothi Lingam, MLA and Durai's sidekick\n* [[Mayilsamy]] as Sankara Narayanan alias Cyber Sanki.

Durai Senthilkumar]] and produced by [[Dhanush]], their second collaboration after ''[[Ethir Neechal (2013 film)|Ethir Neechal]]'' (2013). The film features [[Sivakarthikeyan]] and [[Sri Divya]] in the lead roles, while [[Prabhu (actor)|Prabhu]] and [[Vijay Raaz]] play supporting roles. The film's music was composed by [[Anirudh Ravichander]]. The story revolves around police constable Mathimaran who wants to prove himself as a true, powerful cop by finding ways to solve issues of corruption in the law and order system in the department of police.\n\nThe film, which commenced filming in April 2014, released on 27 February 2015. In 2018, the film was dubbed in Hindi as ''Daring Policewala''.\n\n== Plot ==\nMathimaran  ([[Sivakarthikeyan]]) is a [[police constable]] who only reports to work and goes home daily without contributing anything useful to the society as his boss, Inspector Sathyamurthy ([[Prabhu Ganesan|Prabhu]]), does not want to get on the wrong side of the upper levels of the police, who are corrupt and politically influenced, and is also unwilling to rock the present system due to past experience. Mathimaran and his fellow policemen never get any cases as a result, much to his irritation.\n\nMathimaran falls in love with Divya ([[Sri Divya]]), who works as a nurse in a hospital, but hides his occupation from her as her family hates police officers. With her help, he finds out about an illegal [[organ donation]] racket orchestrated by Durai Arasan ([[Vijay Raaz]]), a politician, and Dr. Devasagayam ([[Yog Japee]]), who is the chairman of the hospital where Divya works. They capture sick and injured migrant workers from [[North India]], make them [[brain death|brain dead]] by administering them [[carbon monoxide]] instead of [[oxygen]], and then harvest their organs, which they sell abroad for huge amounts of money. The organ donation scam gives Mathimaran his first real case, and he takes it on with enthusiasm after Sathyamurthy and Durai's estranged father Singaperumal ([[Nagineedu]]), who had threatened to expose his son's misdeeds, are killed in a bomb blast orchestrated by Durai.\n\nMathimaran first confronts Devasagayam, who commits [[suicide]], but not before admitting his role in the scam and giving detailed information about it. He then decides to confront Durai and get him arrested, but problem is that there is not enough evidence against Durai except Devasagayam's word, and Devasagayam is dead. He tries to get more information about Durai's role in the scam incognito. Unfortunately, Durai soon finds out that Mathimaran is after him, and a cat-and-mouse game begins between the two. In the process, Mathimaran is suspended from duty, as the police commissioner ([[Jeeva Ravi]]) is close to Durai. Undaunted, he manages to expose the scam and Durai's involvement in it to the media, but Durai wriggles out of arrest.\n\nMathimaran decides to finish off Durai to end the scam once and for all. He creates a ruckus during a felicitation function for Durai. In the chaos that ensues, he shoots Durai in the leg and gives him the same treatment which had been meted out to the North Indian workers: administering him carbon monoxide and then harvesting his organs after he is declared brain dead. Durai's death is covered up as a terrorist attack. Mathimaran is eventually promoted to Inspector in reward for his efforts in thwarting the organ donation scam. He also gets accepted by Divya's family, despite being a police officer, and marries Divya.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Sivakarthikeyan]] as Mathimaran Rathnavel, R5 Station Constable\n* [[Sri Divya]] as Divya, Worked as nurse in Hospital Devasagayam\n* [[Prabhu Ganesan|Prabhu]] as Sathyamurthy, R5 Station Inspector\n* [[Vijay Raaz]] as Durai Arasan, Human Trader known as businessman\n* [[Manobala]] as Jyothi Lingam, MLA and Durai's sidekick\n* [[Mayilsamy]] as Sankara Narayanan alias Cyber Sanki.

Raheem's only drawback was his age as he was much older than Gama, and near the end of his career. The bout continued for hours and eventually ended in a draw.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}} The contest with Raheem was the turning point in Gama's career. After that, he was looked upon as the next contender for the title of Rustam-e-Hind or the ''Indian Wrestling Championship''. In the first bout Gama remained defensive, but in the second bout, Gama went on the offensive. Despite severe bleeding from his nose and ears, he managed to deal out a great deal of damage to Raheem Bakhsh.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}}\n\nBy 1910, Gama had defeated all the prominent Indian wrestlers who faced him except the champion, Raheem Bakhsh Sultani Wala (the Rustam-e-Hind or the lineal champion of India). At this time, he focused his attention on the rest of the world. Accompanied by his younger brother [[Imam Baksh Pahalwan|Imam Bakhsh]], Gama sailed to England to compete with the Western wrestlers but could not gain instant entry, because of his lower height.<ref name=alter>{{cite book|last=Alter|first=Joseph S.|title=The wrestler's body identity and ideology in North India|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520912175|page=76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EMu1xKEWBt4C}}</ref>\n\n===Tournament in London===\nIn London, Gama issued a challenge that he could throw any three wrestlers in thirty minutes of any weight class. This announcement however was seen as a bluff by the wrestlers and their wrestling promoter R. B. Benjamin.<ref name=\"toi1\"/> For a long time no one came forward to accept the challenge. To break the ice, Gama presented another challenge to specific heavy weight wrestlers. He challenged [[Stanislaus Zbyszko]] and [[Frank Gotch]], either he would beat them or pay them the prize money and go home. The first professional wrestler to take his challenge was the American [[Ben Roller|Benjamin Roller]]. In the bout, Gama pinned Roller in 1 minute 40 seconds the first time, and in 9 minutes 10 seconds the other. On the second day, he defeated 12 wrestlers and thus gained entry to official tournament.<ref name=alter/>\n\n===Match with Stanislaus Zbyszko===\nHe was pitted against world champion [[Stanislaus Zbyszko]]<ref name=alter/> and the date of bout was set as 10 September 1910. Zbyszko was then regarded among the premier wrestlers in the world; and he would then take on the mammoth challenge of India's feared Great Gama, an undefeated champion who had been unsuccessful in his attempts to lure Frank Gotch into a match. And so, on September 10, 1910, Zbyszko faced the Great Gama in the finals of the John Bull World Championships in London.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}} The match was \u00a3250 in prize money and the John Bull Belt. Within a minute, Zbyszko was taken down and remained in that position for the remaining 2 hours and 35 minutes of the match. There were a few brief moments when Zbyszko would get up, but he just ended back down in his previous position. Crafting a defensive strategy of hugging the mat in order to nullify Great Gama's greatest strengths, Zbyszko wrestled the Indian legend to a draw after nearly three hours of grappling, though Zbyszko's lack of tenacity angered many of the fans in attendance. {{Citation needed|date= June 2018}}\nNevertheless, Zbyszko still became one of the few wrestlers to ever meet the Great Gama without going down in defeat; The two men were set to face each other again on September 17, 1910. On that date, Zbyszko failed to show up and Gama was announced the winner by default.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=The \"John Bull\" Wrestling belt won by an Indian|date=17 September 1910|work=The Derby Daily Telegraph|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> He was awarded the prize and the John Bull Belt. Receiving this belt entitled Gama to be called [[Rustam-e-Zamana]] or [[World Champion]] but not the lineal champion of the world as he hadn't defeated Zbyszko in the ring.\n\n===Bouts against American and European champions===\nDuring this tour Gama defeated some of the most respected grapplers in the world, \"Doc\" [[Benjamin Roller]] of the United States, Maurice Deriaz of Switzerland, Johann Lemm (the European Champion) of Switzerland, and [[Jesse Peterson]] (World Champion) from Sweden. In the match against Roller, Gama threw \"Doc\" 13 times in the 15-minute match.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}} Gama now issued a challenge to the rest of those who laid claim to the World Champion's Title, including Japanese [[Judo]] champion [[Taro Miyake]], [[George Hackenschmidt]] of Russia and [[Frank Gotch]] of the United States \u2013 each declined his invitation to enter the ring to face him. At one point, to face some type of competition, Gama offered to fight twenty English wrestlers, one after another. He announced that he would defeat all of them or pay out prize money, but still no one would take up his challenge.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}}\n\n===Final encounter with Raheem Bakhsh Sultani Wala===\n\nShortly after his return from England, Gama faced Raheem Bakhsh Sultani Wala in [[Allahabad]].

Raheem's only drawback was his age as he was much older than Gama, and near the end of his career. The bout continued for hours and eventually ended in a draw.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}} The contest with Raheem was the turning point in Gama's career. After that, he was looked upon as the next contender for the title of Rustam-e-Hind or the ''Indian Wrestling Championship''.

Despite severe bleeding from his nose and ears, he managed to deal out a great deal of damage to Raheem Bakhsh.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}}\n\nBy 1910, Gama had defeated all the prominent Indian wrestlers who faced him except the champion, Raheem Bakhsh Sultani Wala (the Rustam-e-Hind or the lineal champion of India).

Accompanied by his younger brother [[Imam Baksh Pahalwan|Imam Bakhsh]], Gama sailed to England to compete with the Western wrestlers but could not gain instant entry, because of his lower height.<ref name=alter>{{cite book|last=Alter|first=Joseph S.|title=The wrestler's body identity and ideology in North India|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520912175|page=76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EMu1xKEWBt4C}}</ref>\n\n===Tournament in London===\nIn London, Gama issued a challenge that he could throw any three wrestlers in thirty minutes of any weight class. This announcement however was seen as a bluff by the wrestlers and their wrestling promoter R. B. Benjamin.<ref name=\"toi1\"/> For a long time no one came forward to accept the challenge. To break the ice, Gama presented another challenge to specific heavy weight wrestlers. He challenged [[Stanislaus Zbyszko]] and [[Frank Gotch]], either he would beat them or pay them the prize money and go home. The first professional wrestler to take his challenge was the American [[Ben Roller|Benjamin Roller]]. In the bout, Gama pinned Roller in 1 minute 40 seconds the first time, and in 9 minutes 10 seconds the other. On the second day, he defeated 12 wrestlers and thus gained entry to official tournament.<ref name=alter/>\n\n===Match with Stanislaus Zbyszko===\nHe was pitted against world champion [[Stanislaus Zbyszko]]<ref name=alter/> and the date of bout was set as 10 September 1910. Zbyszko was then regarded among the premier wrestlers in the world; and he would then take on the mammoth challenge of India's feared Great Gama, an undefeated champion who had been unsuccessful in his attempts to lure Frank Gotch into a match. And so, on September 10, 1910, Zbyszko faced the Great Gama in the finals of the John Bull World Championships in London.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}} The match was \u00a3250 in prize money and the John Bull Belt. Within a minute, Zbyszko was taken down and remained in that position for the remaining 2 hours and 35 minutes of the match. There were a few brief moments when Zbyszko would get up, but he just ended back down in his previous position. Crafting a defensive strategy of hugging the mat in order to nullify Great Gama's greatest strengths, Zbyszko wrestled the Indian legend to a draw after nearly three hours of grappling, though Zbyszko's lack of tenacity angered many of the fans in attendance. {{Citation needed|date= June 2018}}\nNevertheless, Zbyszko still became one of the few wrestlers to ever meet the Great Gama without going down in defeat; The two men were set to face each other again on September 17, 1910. On that date, Zbyszko failed to show up and Gama was announced the winner by default.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=The \"John Bull\" Wrestling belt won by an Indian|date=17 September 1910|work=The Derby Daily Telegraph|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> He was awarded the prize and the John Bull Belt. Receiving this belt entitled Gama to be called [[Rustam-e-Zamana]] or [[World Champion]] but not the lineal champion of the world as he hadn't defeated Zbyszko in the ring.\n\n===Bouts against American and European champions===\nDuring this tour Gama defeated some of the most respected grapplers in the world, \"Doc\" [[Benjamin Roller]] of the United States, Maurice Deriaz of Switzerland, Johann Lemm (the European Champion) of Switzerland, and [[Jesse Peterson]] (World Champion) from Sweden. In the match against Roller, Gama threw \"Doc\" 13 times in the 15-minute match.{{Citation needed|date= June 2018}} Gama now issued a challenge to the rest of those who laid claim to the World Champion's Title, including Japanese [[Judo]] champion [[Taro Miyake]], [[George Hackenschmidt]] of Russia and [[Frank Gotch]] of the United States \u2013 each declined his invitation to enter the ring to face him.
