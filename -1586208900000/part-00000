Donald Grant]] became chairman of the board. Grant and Joan Payson had been the only members of the Giants' board to oppose the team's move west.\n\nThe two existing [[sports league|league]]s, which had considerably more autonomy at the time, responded with plans to add four new teams, two in each league. One of the new National League teams was to be in New York. The NL offered this new franchise to the CL's New York group, provided that they commit to building a new park. Shea told [[Mayor of New York City|New York Mayor]] [[Robert F. Wagner, Jr.]] that he had to personally cable all of the  National League team owners and guarantee that the city would build a new facility.\n\nThe new team required a new name, and many were suggested. Among the finalists were \"Bees\", \"[[donkey|Burro]]s\", \"Continentals\", \"Skyscrapers\", \"Skyliners\", and \"Jets\" (which would eventually be used by the [[New York Jets|city]]'s [[American Football League]] team), as well as the eventual runners-up, \"Empires\" and \"Islanders\" (the latter nickname would be used by a [[New York Islanders|future NHL team in the area]]).<ref name=\"Nickname\">{{cite news|title=New National League Team Here Approves Mets as Its Official Nickname|first=Louis|last=Effrat|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 9, 1961|page=48|authorlink=Louis Effrat}}</ref><ref name=Timeline1/> Although Payson had admitted a preference for \"[[Meadowlarks]]\", the owners ultimately selected \"Mets\",<ref name=newclubsname>{{cite news |title=New York Mets New Club's Name |agency=Associated Press |publisher=The Leader-Post, via Google News |date=May 9, 1961 |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pchUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DjwNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2799,2063241&dq=new+york+mets&hl=en }}</ref> because it was closely related to the club's already-existing corporate name, \"New York Metropolitan Baseball Club, Inc.\", it hearkened back to \"[[New York Metropolitans|Metropolitans]]\", a name used by an earlier New York team in the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] from 1880 to 1887,<ref name=newclubsname/> and because its brevity would naturally fit in newspaper headlines.<ref name=\"Nickname\"/> The name was received with broad approval among fans and the press.<ref name=Timeline1/>\n\nFrom the beginning, the Mets sought to appeal to the large contingent of former Giants and Dodgers fans.

In 1964, both teams moved into newly constructed [[Shea Stadium]] in [[Flushing Meadows]], Queens, where the Mets stayed through the 2008 season (the Jets would leave after the 1983 NFL season). In 2009, the club moved into [[Citi Field]], located adjacent to the former site of Shea Stadium.\n\nDuring their history, the Mets have won two [[World Series]] titles (1969 and 1986), five National League [[National League Championship Series|pennants]] (1969, 1973, 1986, 2000, 2015), and six [[National League East]] titles (1969, 1973, 1986, 1988, 2006, 2015). The Mets also qualified for the postseason as the National League [[MLB Wild Card|Wild Card]] team in 1999 and 2000.  The Mets have appeared in more World Series&nbsp;\u2014 five&nbsp;\u2014 than any other [[expansion team]] in Major League Baseball history. Their two championships equal the tally of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]], [[Florida Marlins]]  and [[Kansas City Royals]] for the most titles among expansion teams. The Mets are the only expansion team to have won two World Series championships at home, as the Blue Jays, Marlins and Royals have each won one on the road. (Blue Jays in {{wsy|1992}}, Marlins in {{wsy|2003}}, and the Royals in {{wsy|2015}}.)\n\nThe Mets held the New York baseball attendance record for 29 years. They broke the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]]' 1948 record by drawing nearly 2.7 million in 1970. The Mets broke their own record five times before the Yankees took it back in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYM/attend.shtml|title=New York Mets Attendance, Stadiums, and Park Factors|work=baseball-reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYY/attend.shtml|title=New York Yankees Attendance, Stadiums, and Park Factors|work=baseball-reference.com}}</ref>\n\nNo Met pitcher had ever thrown a [[no-hitter]] until June 1, 2012 when [[Johan Santana]] no-hit the Cardinals.

After the Mets got their first no-hitter, this left the [[San Diego Padres]] as the only remaining team in MLB that has never had a pitcher throw such a game.\n\n=== 1962\u20131966: The Lovable Losers ===\nIn October 1961, the [[National League]] held an [[expansion draft]] to stock the rosters of the Mets and the [[Houston Colt .45s]] with players from other clubs. 22 players were selected by the Mets, including some with notable previous success such as [[Roger Craig (baseball)|Roger Craig]], [[Al Jackson]], [[Frank Thomas (outfielder)|Frank Thomas]], and [[Richie Ashburn]]. But rather than select talented young players with future potential, Mets management preferred to sign faded stars of the Dodgers and Giants to appeal to fans' nostalgia. Legendary Yankees manager [[Casey Stengel]] was hired out of retirement to lead the team,<ref name=Stengel/> but his managerial acumen wasn't enough to overcome the severe deficiency of talent among the players.\n\n====1962\u201363====\nThe [[1962 New York Mets season|Mets]] took the field for the first time on April 11, 1962 against the [[1962 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] (the first game, scheduled for April 10, was delayed due to rain).<ref>{{cite news|title=Mets Rained Out of St. Louis Game|date=April 11, 1962|first=Louis|last=Effrat|newspaper=New York Times|page=52|authorlink=Louis Effrat}}</ref><ref name=FirstGame>{{cite news|title=Cardinals Spoil Mets' Debut With 11-4 Victory on 16 Hits Off 4 Pitchers|date=April 12, 1962|first=Louis|last=Effrat|newspaper=New York Times|page=44|authorlink=Louis Effrat}}</ref> One apocryphal legend has it that in the first game, pitcher Roger Craig went into his windup with the Cardinals' [[Bill White (first baseman)|Bill White]] on third\u2014and dropped the ball.

Their .250 winning percentage was the [[List of worst MLB season records|fourth worst in major-league history]], and the third-worst of the modern era (since 1901). Throughout major league history only the 1899 [[Cleveland Spiders]] (20\u2013134) lost more games in a single season than the 1962 Mets.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Mets' Long Season Ends With Their 120th Defeat, 5 to 1|date=October 1, 1962|first=Louis|last=Effrat|newspaper=New York Times|page=43|authorlink=Louis Effrat}}</ref> It wasn't until 2003 that the record would be threatened by the [[2003 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]], who finished the season at 43\u2013119.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mark?

Journeyman players like the ironically nicknamed [[Marv Throneberry|\"Marvelous Marv\" Throneberry]] became icons of athletic incompetence. Ex-Dodger and Giant pitcher [[Billy Loes]], who was acquired by the Mets after the 1961 expansion draft, was credited with the ungrammatical \"The Mets is a good thing. They give everybody jobs. Just like the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]].\" Even the young Mets proved to have standards, however. In 1962, [[Cleveland Indians]] [[Catcher (baseball)|catcher]] [[Harry Chiti]] was purchased by the Mets for a [[player to be named later]] in the season. After only 15 games and a .195 batting average, the Mets sent him back to the Indians; he never played in another major league game again. Chiti was the first player ever to be sent back to his original team in a trade in Major League history.\n\nThe [[1963 New York Mets season|1963 Mets]] featured a pitcher, Carlton Willey, who was having a great year, pitching four shut-outs, when he incurred an injury and finished with a 9\u201314 win-loss record. The '63 squad also had [[Duke Snider]] who hit his 2,000th hit and later his 400th home run and earned a berth to the 1963 All-Star Game.\n\n====1964====\n{{Main|1964 New York Mets season}}\n\nOn May 26, 1964, in Chicago, they played like champions (at least for one game) and pummeled the [[1964 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]], 19\u20131. According to legend, later that day a fan called a New York newspaper to get the score. He was told: \"They scored 19 runs.\" There was a long silence, then the fan asked: \"Did they win?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://live.msgnetwork.com/content_news.jsp?articleID=v0000msgn20050902T222409167&newsgroup=columnist.article&team=Mets&sports=baseball|last=Loughlin|first=Matt|title=One small step for a kid from Queens|work=MSGNetwork.com|date=September 3, 2005|authorlink=Matt Loughlin|access-date=April 26, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714123320/http://live.msgnetwork.com/content_news.jsp?articleID=v0000msgn20050902T222409167&newsgroup=columnist.article&team=Mets&sports=baseball|archive-date=July 14, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1964, the Mets, who played their first two seasons in the old [[Polo Grounds]], the former home of the Giants, moved to the newly constructed [[Shea Stadium]], a 55,300-seat multipurpose facility built in the [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]] neighborhood of the [[Borough (New York City)|Borough]] of [[Queens]], adjacent to the site of the [[1939 New York World's Fair|1939]] and [[1964 New York World's Fair]]s.\n\nOne high point of Shea Stadium's first season came on [[Father's Day]], when [[1964 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] pitcher [[Jim Bunning]] threw a perfect game against the [[1964 New York Mets season|Mets]], the first in the National League since 1880. For perhaps the only time in the stadium's history, the Shea faithful found themselves rooting for the visitors, caught up in the rare achievement, and roaring for Bunning on every pitch in the ninth inning.<ref>{{cite news|quote=The Phils won the contest...before 32,904 fans who were screaming for Bunning during the last two innings...Yesterday's perfect pitching turned the usually loyal Met fans into Bunning fans in the late innings.

Jr.|last=White|newspaper=New York Times|page=1}}</ref> His strikeout of John Stephenson capped the performance. Another high point was Shea Stadium's hosting of the [[1964 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]]. Unexpectedly thrust into the spotlight in the final hectic weekend of the 1964 season, the Mets relished the role of spoiler, beating the [[1964 St. Louis Cardinals season|Cardinals]] in [[Busch Memorial Stadium|St. Louis]] on Friday and Saturday (keeping alive the hopes of the Phillies, Giants, and Reds) before succumbing to the eventual National League and World Series champions on Sunday.\n\n====1966====\n{{Main|1966 New York Mets season}}\n\nThe Mets' image as [[lovable loser]]s was wearing a little thin as the decade progressed, but things began to change slowly in the late 1960s. In 1966, the Mets chose catcher [[Steve Chilcott]] as the first overall selection in the [[1966 Major League Baseball draft|amateur draft]]. He became the first number one draft pick to retire without reaching the major leagues. The second pick that year was Hall of Famer [[Reggie Jackson]]. That year, the Mets went 66\u201395, the first season they did not finish with 100+ losses.\n\n=== Hodges, Seaver and Koosman ===\nThe Mets acquired top pitching prospect [[Tom Seaver]] in a lottery and he became the league's [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] in 1967. Even though the Mets remained in last place, Tom Seaver was a sign of good fortune to come. He was originally signed by the [[Atlanta Braves]] in February 1966 out of the [[University of Southern California]], but his contract was voided by [[Commissioner of Baseball|Commissioner]] [[William Eckert]] on the basis that the [[USC Trojans baseball|USC season]] had already started when Seaver signed. In order to resolve this issue, the Mets, Indians, and Phillies were all placed in a hat since they were the only teams willing to match the Braves offer, and the Mets were fortunate enough to win the drawing. In addition to Seaver, two other young players were catcher [[Jerry Grote]] and shortstop [[Bud Harrelson]]. This trio of youth formed a new, determined clubhouse nucleus that had no interest in losing, lovably or otherwise. By the 1968 season, [[Wes Westrum]] would be replaced as manager by [[Gil Hodges]]. Pitcher [[Jerry Koosman]] joined the staff and had a spectacular rookie season in 1967, winning 19 games. Left fielder [[Cleon Jones]] developed as a batter and exciting center fielder [[Tommie Agee]] came over in a trade. But although much improved, the [[1968 New York Mets season|1968 team]] still finished the season in 9th place.\n\n=== 1969\u20131972: The Amazin' or Miracle Mets ===\n{{Main|1969 New York Mets season}}\n\nThe Mets began the 1969 season in a mediocre way: an opening day home loss of 11\u201310 to the expansion [[1969 Montreal Expos season|Montreal Expos]] was followed by a record of 21\u201323 through the end of May. On April 10, 1969 [[Tommie Agee]] became the only player ever to hit a home run to the small area of fair territory in the upper level of Shea Stadium. A painted sign on the stands nearby commemorated the spot at Shea.  By mid-August, the favored [[1969 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] seemed safely on their way to winning the first ever National League East Division title (and their first postseason appearance of any kind since [[1945 World Series|1945]]). The Mets sat in third place, ten games behind; but Chicago went 8\u201317 in September, while the Mets, with outstanding pitching from their young staff, piled up victory after victory, winning 38 of their last 49 games. They took first place for good on September 10, and finished in first place with a 100\u201362 record for the season, their first winning year ever, a full eight games over the Cubs. The Mets finished with a team ERA of 2.99, and a league leading 28 shutouts thrown. Tom Seaver led the way with a 25\u20137 record, with lefty [[Jerry Koosman]] behind him at 17\u20139 record, while [[Cleon Jones]] finished with a .340 batting average. Seaver's best game occurred on July 9, at Shea Stadium, where he came within two outs of a perfect game, but gave up a one-out, ninth-inning single to the Cubs' Jimmy Qualls for the only hit in the Mets' 4\u20130 victory.\n\nThe \"Miracle Mets\" or \"Amazin Mets\", as they became known by the press, went on to win a three-game sweep of the strong [[1969 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]], led by legend [[Hank Aaron|Henry \"Hank\" Aaron]], in the very first [[1969 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]]. The Mets were considered underdogs in this series despite the fact that they had a better record than the Braves, the first place team in the National League West.\n\n[[File:Shea Stadium 1969.jpeg|thumb|250px|Shea Stadium prior to a Mets versus Philadelphia Phillies game in 1969.]]\n\nThe Mets were given very little chance in the [[1969 World Series]], facing a powerful [[1969 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]] team that had gone 109\u201353 in the regular season and included [[Frank Robinson]], [[Brooks Robinson]], and [[Jim Palmer]] as well as future Mets manager [[Davey Johnson]], who would make the final out of the Series. Before the series began, pundits predicted Tom Seaver might win the opening game, but that the Mets would have trouble winning again in the World Series. As it turned out, just the opposite occurred; Seaver was roughed up, allowing four runs in the opener, which he lost&nbsp;\u2014 but the Mets' pitching shut down the Orioles after that, holding them to just five runs over the next four games, to win the World Series 4 games to 1. Seaver got his revenge in game four, pitching all 10 innings of a 2\u20131 victory.\n\nFor longtime Mets announcer [[Ralph Kiner]] and many fans, the turning point in the team's season, came in the third inning of the second game of a July 30 doubleheader against the [[1969 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros]]. When left fielder Cleon Jones failed to hustle after a ball hit to the outfield, Mets manager Gil Hodges removed him from the game&nbsp;\u2014 but rather than simply signal from the dugout for Jones to come out, or delegate the job to one of his coaches, Hodges left the dugout and slowly, deliberately, walked all the way out to left field to Jones, and walked him back to the bench. For the rest of that season, Jones never failed to hustle.\n\nThe Miracle Mets magic wore off as the 1970s began. They would continue to produce winning seasons, but did not repeat the success of their championship season. In these subsequent years, Mets pitchers generally excelled but received lackluster support from the hitters, with mediocre finishes the result. Efforts to improve the offense backfired with blunders such as trading [[Amos Otis]] for troubled infielder [[Joe Foy]] after the 1969 season as well as young pitcher [[Nolan Ryan]] for infielder [[Jim Fregosi]] after the 1971 season. Once out of the glaring New York spotlight, Ryan became one of the best pitchers in history, spending 22 more years in the majors and entering the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1999 as a [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Ranger]]. Fregosi battled injuries and played just 146 games for the Mets over a season and a half. Meanwhile, Otis became a star with the [[Kansas City Royals]] while Foy lasted only one season in New York.\n\nThe team was thrown into confusion and shock prior to the 1972 season, when Manager [[Gil Hodges]], who had led the team to the World Series victory in 1969, suffered a sudden heart attack at the end of spring training and died. Coach [[Yogi Berra]] succeeded Hodges.\n\n===1973: \"Ya Gotta Believe!\"===\n[[File:Mets home run apple.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The home run apple in Shea Stadium]]\n{{Main|1973 New York Mets season}}\nDespite high hopes following the 1969 championship season, the Mets could not break through to the postseason in the early '70s, coming up short three times. Then, in 1973, the Mets found themselves deadlocked with their opponents in what was then the tightest divisional race of the century. Despite going .600 for the month of April, the team then floundered as the season progressed. Hampered with many injuries,  Berra's Mets found themselves in last place with a 61\u201371 record at the end of August 1973, but when they got healthy again, they recovered behind relief pitcher [[Tug McGraw]] and his '''\"Ya gotta believe!\"''' rallying cry (a phrase the team has since [[trademark]]ed), winning 21 of their last 29 games. Berra also coined his most famous [[Yogi Berraism|Yogiism]] that year: '''\"It ain't over till it's over!\"''' Their final record of only 82\u201379 was good enough to win the division while five better teams missed the postseason. Despite the second-worst winning percentage ever by a division winner (until the [[2005 San Diego Padres season|2005 San Diego Padres]]), the Mets stunned the heavily favored [[1973 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] \"[[The Big Red Machine|Big Red Machine]]\" in the [[1973 National League Championship Series|NLCS]], beating them in 5 games. Their record remains the lowest of any pennant-winning team but they managed to push the defending World Series Champion [[1973 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] to a seventh game. Their near-miracle season ended with a loss to [[Ken Holtzman]] in the final contest.\n\nThis was the only NL East title between 1970 and 1980 that wasn't won by either the [[Phillies\u2013Pirates rivalry|Philadelphia Phillies or the Pittsburgh Pirates]].<ref name=ExclusiveReign>{{cite web|url=http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050707&content_id=1119893&vkey=news_phi&fext=.jsp&c_id=phi|title=Notes: Phils\u2013Pirates rivalry fading|date=July 7, 2005|accessdate=January 3, 2011|first=George|last=Von Benko|work=Phillies.MLB.com|quote=From 1974-80, the [[Philadelphia Phillies|Phillies]] and [[Pittsburgh Pirates|Pirates]] won all seven National League East titles (Phillies four, Pirates three).}}</ref><ref name=PiratesFirstThreePeat>{{cite news|title=Pirates perform rare three-peat feat 4\u20132|date=September 28, 1992|newspaper=USA Today|page=5C|quote=The Pirates...won three (NL East titles) in a row from 1970-72.}}</ref> Those two teams reigned exclusively as NL East champions during that span (Pirates from [[1970 Pittsburgh Pirates season|1970]]\u2013[[1972 Pittsburgh Pirates season|1972]] and won the [[1971 World Series]], [[1974 Pittsburgh Pirates season|1974]], [[1975 Pittsburgh Pirates season|1975]], and winning the [[1979 World Series]], Phillies from [[1976 Philadelphia Phillies season|1976]]\u2013[[1978 Philadelphia Phillies season|1978]] and winning the [[1980 World Series]]).<ref name=ExclusiveReign/><ref name=PiratesFirstThreePeat/>\n\n===1974-1979: The Midnight Massacre and Dark Ages===\nAfter the Mets' 1973 pennant-winning season, the team fell out of contention. They fell below .500 for the first time in six years, and though they resumed their winning ways in 1975 and 1976, they never came close to winning the NL East. As the 1975 season ended, owner Joan Payson died, leaving the team to her husband Charles. While Joan Payson had been the driving force behind the Mets, her successors did not share her enthusiasm. Charles delegated his authority to his three daughters, who in turn left control over baseball matters to club chairman Grant. Contract disputes with star pitcher [[Tom Seaver]] and slugger [[Dave Kingman]] erupted in 1977. These disputes came to a head when both players were traded on June 15, the trading deadline, to the Cincinnati Reds and San Diego Padres, respectively, in what New York [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]s dubbed \"The Midnight Massacre.\" The Mets received six players in the two deals, but none had any lasting impact. Attendance dropped, to the point where Shea Stadium was nicknamed \"Grant's Tomb.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Jerry's Name in the Lineup; Sports of The Times Broadway Willie Baseball's Bill Blass|first=Red|last=Smith|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 8, 1978|page=15|authorlink=Red Smith (sportswriter)}}</ref> Coincidentally, the Yankees began their resurgence at roughly the same time, further eroding the Mets' fan base.\n\nThe [[1978 New York Mets season|team]] finished in last place yet again in 1978. By this time, it was obvious that Grant had mismanaged the team and failed to invest in its future. Charles Payson himself fired Grant at the end of the season. Things only got worse in 1979: The Mets were in last place before the end of April, and attendance dropped below 1 million for the first time in history. They would not become a competitive team again until the mid-1980s, marking the first time that both New York teams were competitive at the same time, both on the field and at the box office.\n\n=== 1980-1984: Doubleday, Strawberry, and Gooden ===\n[[File:Shea 10-12-07.jpg|thumb|[[Shea Stadium]] was the Mets' home from 1964 to 2008.]]\nIn January 1980, the Payson heirs sold the Mets franchise to the [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] publishing company for $21.1 million, a record amount at that time. [[Nelson Doubleday, Jr.]] was named chairman of the board while minority shareholder [[Fred Wilpon]] took the role of club president. In February, Wilpon hired longtime [[Baltimore Orioles]] executive [[Frank Cashen]] as general manager who began the process of rebuilding the Mets much in the same way he developed the Orioles in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nCashen's positive impact on the organization took some time to be felt at the major league level. He began by selecting slugging high school phenomenon [[Darryl Strawberry]] as the number one overall pick in the [[1980 Major League Baseball draft|1980 amateur draft]]. Two years later, hard-throwing hurler [[Dwight Gooden]] was taken as the fifth overall selection in the [[1982 Major League Baseball draft|1982 draft]]. The pair rose quickly through the minors, winning consecutive [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] awards (Strawberry in 1983, Gooden in 1984). Cashen's mid-season 1983 trade for former [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] [[Keith Hernandez]] from the Cardinals helped spark the Mets' return to competitive contention. After finishing their first three campaigns of the 1980s decade in either 5th or 6th (last) place, in 1984, new manager [[Davey Johnson]] was promoted from the helm of the AAA [[Norfolk Tides|Tidewater Tides]] and led the Mets to a 90\u201372 record, their first winning season since 1976.\n\n=== 1985-1988: \"Party Hard; Play Harder\" Era ===\n\n====1985====\n{{Main|1985 New York Mets season}}\nIn 1985, the Mets acquired catcher [[Gary Carter]] from the [[Montreal Expos]] and won 98 games, but lost the division title to the [[1985 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] in the final days of the season in a memorable series. The Mets began the series three games behind St. Louis and won the first two, but faltered in the third game, allowing St. Louis to remain in first place and clinch the division.\n\n====1986: World Champions again====\n{{Main|1986 New York Mets season}}\nBefore the 1986 season, Doubleday sold his publishing company to the (then) West German multinational corporation [[Bertelsmann AG]], and used the proceeds from the sale to buy the Mets in his own name for $81 million.  He then sold a half-stake to Wilpon, making them equal partners in the team.\n\nUnlike the league champion Mets of 1969 or 1973, the 1986 Mets broke away from the rest of the division early and dominated throughout the entire year. They won 20 of their first 24 games, clinched the East Division title on September 17, and finished the year 108\u201354, which tied with the [[1975 Cincinnati Reds season|1975 Cincinnati Reds]] for the third highest win total in National League history, behind the [[1906 Chicago Cubs season|1906 Chicago Cubs]] (116) and the [[1909 Pittsburgh Pirates season|1909 Pittsburgh Pirates]] (110). The relative lack of excitement during the regular season was more than compensated for by the spectacularly suspenseful and dramatic post-season series.\n\nIn the [[1986 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]], the Mets faced their fellow 1962 expansion team, the [[1986 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros]]. Unlike the Mets, the Astros had yet to win a pennant, but had former Mets pitchers [[Mike Scott (baseball)|Mike Scott]], the league's [[Cy Young Award]] winner, and [[fireballer]] [[Nolan Ryan]] leading their pitching staff. The Mets took a two-games-to-one lead with a come-from-behind [[walk-off home run]] by [[Lenny Dykstra]]. In Game 6, the Mets turned a 3\u20130 ninth-inning deficit into a sixteen-inning marathon victory to clinch the National League pennant and earn their third [[World Series]] appearance. The Astros would have to wait until [[2005 National League Championship Series|2005]] to finally win their first pennant.\n\nIn the [[1986 World Series|World Series]] against the [[1986 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]], the Mets faced elimination leading into Game 6. The Red Sox scored two runs in the 10th inning and twice came within one strike of winning their first World Series since {{wsy|1918}}. However, the Mets rallied and would come back in typical Amazin' Mets fashion, as the game became one of the most famous games in baseball history as the [[Curse of the Bambino]] appeared to be alive and well. In fact, it was in this series that talk of this curse began.<ref>{{cite news|title=SPORTS OF THE TIMES; [[Babe Ruth]] Curse Strikes Again|date=October 28, 1986|first=George|last=Vecsey|work=The New York Times|page=D33|authorlink=George Vecsey}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/playoffs/2004-10-27-ws-game4_x.htm\n|title=Curse RIP: 1918\u20132004; After decades of pain, Red Sox on top of world|date=October 28, 2004|first=Mike|last=Dodd|newspaper=USA Today|quote=The Curse of the Bambino, said to have started after Red Sox owner [[Harry Frazee]] sold Babe Ruth to the Yankees after the [[1919 Major League Baseball season|1919 season]]...soared in popularity after the Sox came within one strike of winning the 1986 Series, only to collapse as a ground ball went between first baseman Bill Buckner's legs.|page=C1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|page=[https://archive.org/details/reversingcursein00shau/page/11 11]|title=Reversing the Curse|first=Dan|last=Shaughnessy|year=2005|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=New York|isbn=0-618-51748-0|authorlink=Dan Shaughnessy|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/reversingcursein00shau/page/11}}</ref>\n\nWith two outs and down two runs, three consecutive singles brought the Mets within {{convert|90|ft|m}} of knotting the score. Hitter [[Mookie Wilson]] ran the count to 2\u20131, then fouled off 3 consecutive pitches. With the count 2\u20132, pitcher [[Bob Stanley (baseball)|Bob Stanley]] threw a wild pitch that Wilson had to leap out of the way of. Boston catcher [[Rich Gedman]] made a wild stab for the ball but it went to the backstop. Pinch hitter [[Kevin Mitchell (baseball)|Kevin Mitchell]] scored from third base, tying the game.\n\nNow facing a full count, Wilson fouled off two more pitches. On [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]], [[Vin Scully]] then called a play that would quickly become an iconic one to baseball fans, with the normally calm Scully growing increasingly excited: {{Cquote|So the winning run is at second base, with two outs, three and two to Mookie Wilson. (A) little roller up along first... ''behind the bag! It gets through [[Bill Buckner|Buckner]]! Here comes [[Ray Knight|Knight]], and the Mets win it!''}}\n\nScully then remained silent for more than three minutes, letting the pictures and the crowd noise tell the story. Scully resumed with: {{cquote|If one picture is worth a thousand words, you have seen about a million words, but more than that, you have seen an absolutely bizarre finish to Game 6 of the 1986 World Series. The Mets are not only alive, they are well, and they will play the [[1986 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] in Game 7 tomorrow!}}\n\nThe Mets went on to win their second World Series title by taking Game 7, also in dramatic fashion, overcoming a 3 run deficit while scoring a total of 8 runs during the final 3 innings. The final score was 8\u20135 with Mets' pitcher Jesse Orosco ending the game by striking out Marty Barrett. Orosco then threw his glove high in the air and dropped to his knees while catcher Gary Carter ran to the mound to embrace him.  This scene was captured on film and would become an iconic image, taken by Mets photographer [[George Kalinsky]], in Mets baseball history and in all of baseball. The Mets remained the only team to come within one strike of losing a World Series before recovering to become World Champions, until the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] did it in 2011. The Mets winning this World Series is the highest-rated single World Series game to date. The Mets were also the first team to win a World Series in a potential clinching game delayed by rain, as Game 7 was postponed by one day.<ref>{{cite news|page=217|quote=The Phillies were the first team to have a potential clinching game in the World Series delayed by rain since the Mets and the Red Sox had to wait an extra day before playing Game 7 of the 1986 World Series, thanks to A) Bill Buckner (and accomplices) and B) a rainout the night after the Buckner game.|title=Worth The Wait: Tales of the 2008 Phillies|first=Jayson|last=Stark|isbn=1-60078-273-6|publisher=Triumph Books|year=2009|authorlink=Jayson Stark}}</ref>\n\nWhile the team around the 1986 championship was strong, they also became infamous for off-the-field controversy. Both Strawberry and Gooden were youngsters who wound up burning out long before their time because of various substance abuse and personal problems. Hernandez's cocaine abuse was the subject of persistent rumors even before he joined the Mets, but he publicly acknowledged his addiction in 1985 and made a successful recovery. Lenny Dykstra's reputation was recently tainted by allegations of [[steroid]] use and [[gambling]] problems.<ref name=\"USATodaySteroids\">{{cite news\n|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2005-04-24-dykstra-steroids_x.htm\n|title=Report: Lawsuit alleges Dykstra used steroids, gambled\n|work=[[USA Today]]\n|accessdate=June 17, 2006\n|date=April 24, 2005}}</ref>\nInstead of putting together a winning dynasty, the problems caused the Mets to soon fall apart.<ref name=\"SIFlashback\">{{cite news\n|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/news/2000/02/23/strawberry_flashback_95\n|last=Verducci\n|first=Tom\n|title=High Price of Hard Living\n|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]\n|accessdate=June 17, 2006\n|date=February 27, 1995}}</ref>\nDespite Darryl Strawberry's numerous off-the-field mishaps, he remains the Mets' all-time leader in home runs and runs batted in.\n\nThis World Series championship by the Mets had a strange twist: [[Lou Gorman]], the general manager of the Red Sox, was vice president, player personnel, of the Mets from 1980 to 1983. Working under Mets' GM [[Frank Cashen]], with whom Gorman served with the Orioles, he helped lay the foundation for the Mets' championship.\n\n====1987====\n{{Main|1987 New York Mets season}}\n\nAfter winning the World Series in 1986 the Mets declined to re-sign World Series MVP [[Ray Knight]], who then signed with the [[Baltimore Orioles]]. Also, they traded the flexible [[Kevin Mitchell (baseball)|Kevin Mitchell]] to the Padres for long-ball threat [[Kevin McReynolds]]. But the biggest shock since the Midnight Massacre of 1977 was when Mets' ace Dwight Gooden was admitted to a drug clinic after testing positive for cocaine. But after struggling in the first few months of the 1987 season, \"Dr. K\" would come back, and so would the Mets. It was during the tough times that the Mets made a great long-term deal, trading [[Ed Hearn (catcher)|Ed Hearn]] to the [[Kansas City Royals]] for pitcher [[David Cone]]. They would surge to battle [[1987 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis]] for the division title. They would have two tough losses to the Cardinals. The first came on [[Seat Cushion Night]] where [[Tom Herr]] hit a walk-off grand slam. But the worst loss came on September 11 in a game against St. Louis, 3rd baseman [[Terry Pendleton]] hit a homer to give the Cardinals a lead, and eventually the NL East title. One highlight of the year was [[Darryl Strawberry]] and [[Howard Johnson (baseball)|Howard Johnson]] becoming the first teammates' ever to hit 30 homers and steal 30 bases in the same season.\n\n====1988====\n{{Main|1988 New York Mets season}}\n\nAfter missing the playoffs in 1987, the 1988 Mets again won the division. Thanks to some stellar pitching from Gooden, [[Ron Darling]], and [[David Cone]] as well as offense from McReynolds, Strawberry, and Howard Johnson, the Mets won 100 games for the 2nd time in 3 campaigns (to date, 1988 is also the last time they have finished with that many wins). In addition, Strawberry and McReynolds both lost the MVP to [[Kirk Gibson]] as they finished 2nd and 3rd in the voting, respectively. Despite this, however, the clubhouse was distracted by the presence of a young [[Gregg Jefferies]] who was just called up. The veteran players took a dislike to Jefferies, who had a habit of excessive bragging, prompting his teammates to saw his custom-made bats in half as a form of hazing.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.projo.com/cgi-bin/include.pl/redsox/crank/main.htm | title=Underappreciated Teams | last=McLaughlin | first=Dan | date=February 28, 2003 | work=[[The Providence Journal]]}}</ref>  The Mets played the [[1988 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] in the [[1988 National League Championship Series]] in a season where they beat them 10 out of 11 times but, led by [[Orel Hershiser]], the Dodgers continued their [[cinderella (sports)|Cinderella story season]] by beating the Mets in seven games.\n\n===1989\u20131990: The Championship Team Disassembles===\nThe 1989 Mets began with a slow start, thanks to an infamous Picture Day brawl between [[Darryl Strawberry]] and [[Keith Hernandez]], apparently because Hernandez told reporters that [[Kevin McReynolds]] should win the 1988 NL MVP over Strawberry (although Los Angeles' [[Kirk Gibson]] would beat both Mets for the award). Eventually, the Mets (as well as the [[1989 Montreal Expos season|Montreal Expos]]) would battle the [[1989 Chicago Cubs season|Cubs]] for the division title in 1989, but Chicago would prevail, despite a career year by Howard Johnson and a deadline trade with [[Minnesota Twins|Minnesota]] for 1988 AL Cy Young winner [[Frank Viola]]. Those high points were tempered by injuries to Gooden, Hernandez and Carter as well as an ill-fated trade<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sportingnews.com/archives/sports2000/players/162287.html | title=Backdraft: New York Mets | date=May 30, 1999 | work=[[The Sporting News]] | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012222602/http://www.sportingnews.com/archives/sports2000/players/162287.html | archivedate=October 12, 2007 }}</ref> that sent Dykstra and [[Roger McDowell]] to [[Philadelphia Phillies|Philadelphia]] in exchange for [[Juan Samuel]]. After the season, Samuel, who hit .235 that season, would be traded to the Dodgers for [[Mike Marshall (outfielder)|Mike Marshall]], who would hit .239 in 53 games for the Mets before being traded to Boston. Dykstra, however, would become an All-Star in Philadelphia and help lead his team to a pennant in 1993.\n\nThat offseason, the Mets had a mix of triumph and tragedy. They would receive All-Star closer and native New Yorker [[John Franco]] in a trade with the [[Cincinnati Reds]], and Strawberry, in legal trouble as well, would check into an alcohol rehabilitation center and miss the start of the season. They would also lose key veterans [[Gary Carter]] and [[Keith Hernandez]] as they left for the Giants and Indians in free agency, respectively. The next season, the Mets would surge again to battle the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], by September 3 had a 77\u201355 record a half game lead, but Pittsburgh's \"B-B Guns\" (which included [[Barry Bonds]], [[Bobby Bonilla]], [[Jay Bell]] and now former Met Wally Backman) led the Pirates to their first NLCS since 1979. In that campaign, general manager [[Frank Cashen]] fired Johnson from his managerial job and replaced him with former shortstop [[Bud Harrelson]]. Although he led them to a good finish in 1990 (Strawberry's last with the Mets, as he went on to sign with the Dodgers in the offseason), the Mets fell to 5th place in 1991. Before the 1991 season the Mets signed [[Vince Coleman]] to a $2 million contract after failing to sign defending batting champion [[Willie McGee]] (who went to San Francisco). This was the first of what would lead to many bad free agent signings and trades that would doom the Mets during the mid-1990s.\n\n===1991\u20131993: ''The Worst Team Money Could Buy''===\n\n====1991\u201392====\nDuring the 1991 season, the [[1991 New York Mets season|Mets]] were actually in contention for the first half of the season, closing to within 2.5 games of the front-running [[1991 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pirates]] at one point. In the latter half, however, the bottom completely fell out and Harrelson was fired with a week left to go in the season, replaced by third base coach [[Mike Cubbage]] for the final games. Jefferies was once again a distraction as he released a controversial statement to be read on [[WFAN]] radio: \"When a pitcher is having trouble getting players out, when a hitter is having trouble hitting, or when a player makes an error, I try to support them in whatever way I can. I don't run to the media to belittle them or to draw more attention to their difficult times. I can only hope that one day those teammates who have found it convenient to criticize me will realize that we are all in this together. If only we can concentrate more on the games, rather than complaining and bickering and pointing fingers, we would all be better off.\"''<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/25/sports/heartfelt-plea-vintage-whine-jefferies-writes-fans.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm Heartfelt Plea?

The season ended on a high note, however, as [[David Cone]] pitched a one-hit shutout against the [[1991 Philadelphia Phillies season|Phillies]] at [[Veterans Stadium]], in which he struck out 19 batters, tying the National League regulation game record (first set by former Met [[Tom Seaver]]).\n\nWith all of the personal problems swirling around the Mets after the 1986 championship, the Mets tried to rebuild using experienced superstars. They picked up [[Eddie Murray]] for over $3 million, [[Bobby Bonilla]] for over $6 million. They also traded McReynolds and Jefferies for one-time World Series hero [[Bret Saberhagen]] and his $3 million contract, along with signing veteran free agent pitcher [[Frank Tanana]] for $1.5 million. The rebuilding was supported by the slogan, \"Hardball Is Back\".<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEEDF1230F935A15750C0A965958260 THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING \u2013 ADDENDA; A New Approach For the Mets], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 26, 1993</ref>\n\nThe experiment of building a team via free agency quickly flopped as Saberhagen and Coleman were soon injured and spent more time on the disabled list than on the field, and Bonilla exhibited unprofessional behavior towards members of the press, once threatening a reporter by saying, \"I'll show you The Bronx\" [http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/readers/signings.html]. At the beginning of the 1991 season, Coleman, Gooden and outfielder [[Daryl Boston]] were named in an alleged sexual abuse incident against a woman near the Mets' spring training facility; charges were later dropped. Meanwhile, popular pitcher [[David Cone]] was dealt to the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] during the 1992 season for [[Ryan Thompson (baseball)|Ryan Thompson]] and [[Jeff Kent]]. While the move was widely criticized by fans of both teams, the Jays went on to win the [[1992 World Series]].  Their descent was chronicled by the book ''The Worst Team Money Could Buy: The Collapse Of The New York Mets'' ({{ISBN|0-8032-7822-5}}) by Mets beat writers [[Bob Klapisch]] and John Harper.\n\n====1993====\n{{Main|1993 New York Mets season}}\n\nThe lowest point of the experiment was the 1993 season when the Mets lost 103 games. In April of that year, Coleman accidentally hit Gooden's shoulder with a golf club while practicing his swing. In July, Saberhagen threw a firecracker under a table near reporters. Their young pitching prospect [[Anthony Young (baseball)|Anthony Young]] started the '93 season at 0\u201313 and his overall streak of 27 straight losses over two years set a new record. After Young's record-setting loss, Coleman threw a firecracker out of the team bus window and injured three people resulting in felony charges that effectively ended his Mets career; the Mets placed him on paid administrative leave for the remainder of the season, and announced less than a month before the end of the season that he would never play for them again. Only a few days later, Saberhagen was in trouble again, this time for spraying [[bleach]] at three reporters. The meltdown season resulted in the worst record for a Mets team since 1965. In addition, two of the three remaining links to the '86 team, [[Howard Johnson (baseball)|Howard Johnson]] and [[Sid Fernandez]], departed after the season via free agency.\n\n===1994 strike-shortened season===\n{{Main|1994 New York Mets season}}\n[[File:New York Mets at Chicago Cubs 1994-04-04 (ticket).jpg|thumb|right|275px|A ticket for the Mets' 1994 [[Opening Day]] game against the [[Chicago Cubs]].]]\nThe [[1994 Major League Baseball season|following season]] was filled with some bright spots, but there was still trouble for the franchise, and for the team's franchise player. Gooden, who had a 3\u20134 record with a 6.31 ERA in the final year of his contract with the team, shocked not only New York sports fans, but baseball fans around the country by testing positive for [[cocaine]] and was suspended by Major League Baseball for 60 days. Shortly after he began serving his suspension for the positive drug test, it was announced that he had again tested positive for cocaine and was now being suspended by Major League Baseball for one year, thus ending his Mets career and nearly his life. The day after receiving the second suspension, Gooden's then-wife, Monica, found him in his bedroom with a loaded gun to his head.\n\nStill, the 1994 season saw some promise for the troubled Mets, as first baseman [[Rico Brogna]] and second baseman [[Jeff Kent]] became fan favorites with their solid glove work and potential 20\u201325 home run power, Bonilla started to become the player the Mets expected, and a healthy Saberhagen, along with promising young starter [[Bobby Jones (right-handed pitcher)|Bobby Jones]] and John Franco, helped the Mets pitching staff along. In the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|strike-shortened]] 1994 season the Mets were in 3rd place behind first-place [[1994 Montreal Expos season|Montreal]] and [[1994 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta]] when the season ended on August 12.\n\n===1995\u20131997: Working Their Way Back===\n\n====1995 season====\n{{Main|1995 New York Mets season}}\n\nWhen the strike finally ended in 1995, the Mets finally showed some promise again, finishing in 2nd place (but still 6 games under .500) behind eventual World Series champion Atlanta.\n\nThe 1995 season marked the emergence of pitchers [[Bill Pulsipher]], [[Jason Isringhausen]], and [[Paul Wilson (baseball)|Paul Wilson]]. The trio were dubbed [[Generation K (baseball)|Generation K]], a group of talented young hurlers who were destined to bring the Mets into greatness, much like Tom Seaver, Jerry Koosman and [[Nolan Ryan]] did in the 1960s. However, all three players succumbed to injury, preventing them from reaching their full potential. Of the three of them, only Isringhausen would accomplish much of significance in the majors, but as a reliever, eventually reaching 300 career saves.\n\n====1996 season====\n{{Main|1996 New York Mets season}}\n\nThe Mets dismal 1996 season was highlighted by the play of [[switch hitter|switch hitting]] [[catcher]] [[Todd Hundley]] breaking the Major League Baseball single season record for home runs hit by catcher with 41. [[Center fielder]] [[Lance Johnson]] set single-season franchise records in [[Hit (baseball)|hits]] (227), [[Triple (baseball)|triples]] (21), [[at bat]]s (682), [[Run (baseball)|runs scored]] (117).

The Mets, in front of a national audience on [[ESPN Sunday Night Baseball|''Sunday Night Baseball'']], beat the [[1999 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] 7\u20132 in the turning point of the 1999 season. Both Mike Piazza and Robin Ventura had MVP-type seasons and [[Benny Agbayani]] emerged as an important role player. It was a breakout year for Mets second baseman [[Edgardo Alfonzo]] and [[Roger Cede\u00f1o]], who broke the single season steals record for the Mets.\n\nAfter the regular season ended, the Mets played [[1999 National League Wild-Card tie-breaker game|a one-game playoff]] against the [[1999 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]], [[Al Leiter]] pitched the best game of his Met career as he hurled a two-hit complete-game shutout to advance the Mets to the playoffs. In the [[1999 National League Division Series|NLDS]], the Mets defeated the [[1999 Arizona Diamondbacks season|Arizona Diamondbacks]] 3 games to 1. The series-clinching victory included a walk-off home run by backup catcher [[Todd Pratt]]. The Mets would lose however in the [[1999 National League Championship Series]] to the [[1999 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]], in six exciting games which included the famous [[Grand Slam Single]] by Robin Ventura to win game 5 for the Mets.<ref name=SubwaySeries/> The Mets were at one point down 3\u20130 in the series.\n\n====2000: The \"Subway World Series\"====\n{{Main|2000 New York Mets season}}\nIn the 1999 offseason, the Mets traded Roger Cede\u00f1o and [[Octavio Dotel]] to the [[Houston Astros]] for [[Derek Bell (baseball)|Derek Bell]] and [[Mike Hampton]]. [[Todd Zeile]] was signed to play first base, replacing departing free agent John Olerud.\n\nThe 2000 season began well for the Mets as Derek Bell became the best hitter on the team for the first month. The highlight of the season came on June 30 when the Mets beat the rival [[2000 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]] in a memorable game at Shea Stadium on ''Fireworks Night''. With the Mets losing 8\u20131 to begin the bottom of the eighth, they rallied back with two outs to tie the game, capping the 10-run inning with Mike Piazza's three run home run to put the Mets up 11\u20138, giving them the lead and eventually the win. The Mets easily made the playoffs winning the [[National League]] wild card. In the playoffs, the Mets beat the [[2000 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] in the first round and the [[2000 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] in the [[2000 National League Championship Series]] to win their fourth NL pennant. Mike Hampton was named the NLCS MVP for his two scoreless starts in the series as the Mets headed to the [[2000 World Series]] to face their crosstown rivals, the New York Yankees. The Mets were defeated in the much-hyped \"[[Subway Series]].\" This marked the first all-New York World Series since [[1956 World Series|1956]], when the [[1956 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] defeated the [[1956 Brooklyn Dodgers season|Brooklyn Dodgers]]. With the Cardinals sweeping the Braves in their NLDS series, it made the Mets' run to the World Series much easier, given that the Braves eliminated the Mets from the playoffs and/or playoff contention in 1998 and 1999.<ref name=SubwaySeries>{{cite book|title=The subway series: the Yankees, the Mets and a season to remember|year=2000|publisher=The Sporting News|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=0-89204-659-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=From Wild Card to World Series|date=October 17, 2000|first=Murray|last=Chass|newspaper=New York Times|authorlink=Murray Chass}}</ref>\n\nThe most memorable moment of the 2000 World Series occurred during the first inning of Game 2 at Yankee Stadium. Piazza fouled off a pitch which shattered his bat, sending a piece of the barrel toward the pitcher's mound. Pitcher [[Roger Clemens]] seized the piece and hurled it in the direction of Piazza as the catcher trotted to first base, benches briefly cleared before the game was resumed with no ejections. In July 2000, Clemens had knocked Piazza unconscious with a fastball to the helmet, Piazza had previously enjoyed great success against Clemens, with 3 crucial home runs in previous encounters.\n\n====2001: September 11 attacks====\n{{Main|2001 New York Mets season}}\nIn 2001, the Mets finished with a record of 82\u201380. After the [[September 11 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]] [[Shea Stadium]] was used as a relief center and then saw the first sporting event in New York City since the attacks, in a game vs. the [[2001 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]] on September 21. Before the game the [[New York City Fire Department|FDNY]], [[New York City Fire Department#Bureau of EMS|EMT]], [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]], and all rescue workers were honored, [[Diana Ross]] sang \"[[God Bless America]]\", the two teams shook hands to show that they were united in the face of tragedy, and Liza Minnelli sang \"[[Theme from New York, New York|New York, New York]]\" during the 7th inning stretch. In the bottom of the 8th inning the Mets were trailing 2\u20131 when Mike Piazza came to bat with a runner on first. Piazza dramatically sent Shea into a frenzy by crushing a home run to give the Mets a 3\u20132 lead and the eventual win. The game is considered to be one of the greatest moments in the history of the franchise. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Mets, as well as other teams in the league, wore [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]], FDNY, NYPD and [[PAPD]] baseball caps. Unlike the other teams, the Mets wore these for the rest of the year, despite threats of fines by Major League Baseball.\n\n====2002 season====\n{{Main|2002 New York Mets season}}\n\nIn the following seasons, the Mets struggled mightily as the result of several poor player acquisitions, including [[Mo Vaughn]], [[Roberto Alomar]], and re-acquiring former Mets Roger Cede\u00f1o and [[Jeromy Burnitz]]. These acquisitions were made by then-general manager [[Steve Phillips]], who was fired during the 2003 season. Phillips was credited with building the 2000 World Series team, but also blamed for the demise of the Mets' farm system and the poor play of the acquired players. His final year as a Met was the 2002 season after playing 8 seasons with the club [[Edgardo Alfonzo]] left New York after signing as a free agent that off-season with the [[San Francisco Giants]]. The Mets did have a few bright spots in 2002. Al Leiter became the first major league pitcher to defeat all thirty major league teams with a victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. However, the Mets posted a 75\u201386 record, last in the [[National League East|NL East]].\n\nThe team's 2002 difficulties reached off the field as co-owners Wilpon and Doubleday became embroiled in a bitter legal dispute over Wilpon's attempt to buy Doubleday's half of the team. Doubleday alleged that Major League Baseball attached an unrealistically low value to the team, thereby lowering the amount of money he would receive from Wilpon in the buyout. Wilpon sued Doubleday in federal court to force the sale. The purchase was finally settled and Wilpon became sole owner of the Mets on August 23, 2002.<ref name=\"NYTWilpon\">{{cite news|title=Sale to Wilpon Is Final|work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 24, 2002|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01E4D6123CF937A1575BC0A9649C8B63|accessdate=July 27, 2008}}</ref>  Wilpon, the founder of [[Sterling Equities]], Inc., manages the Mets through his [[limited partnership]] firm, Sterling Mets.<ref name=\"HooverSterlingMets\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hoovers.com/sterling-mets-lp/--ID__46720--/free-co-profile.xhtml|title=Sterling Mets LP \u2013 Company Description|publisher=[[Hoover's]]|accessdate=July 27, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===2003\u20132010: Minaya, Randolph, Reyes/Wright, collapses and Citi Field===\nIn a span of about a calendar year the Mets called up top prospects shortstop [[Jos\u00e9 Reyes (infielder)|Jos\u00e9 Reyes]] and third baseman [[David Wright]]. Since then Reyes and Wright have become the most accomplished products from the Mets' farm system since [[Darryl Strawberry]] and [[Dwight Gooden]].\n\n====2003 season====\n{{Main|2003 New York Mets season}}\n\nThe Mets' record in 2003 (66\u201395) was the fourth worst in baseball, and Piazza had missed two-thirds of the season with a torn groin muscle. His steady decline around that time mirrored the Mets' fortunes for the first half of the decade. Also Jos\u00e9 Reyes <nowiki/>made his debut on June 10, 2003 and his first career homerun happened to be a grand slam against the [[Los Angeles Angels|Anaheim Angels]] that season.\n\n====2004 season====\n{{Main|2004 New York Mets season}}\n\nIn 2004, the Mets made more poor player acquisitions including signing Japanese shortstop [[Kazuo Matsui]], who never lived up to his potential in two-and-a-half years with the Mets. General manager [[Jim Duquette]] acquired pitcher [[Kris Benson]] for third baseman [[Ty Wigginton]] at the trade deadline just before one of the worst trades in franchise history, sending highly touted pitching prospect [[Scott Kazmir]] to the [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] for the disappointing [[V\u00edctor Zambrano]]. On July 21, 2004, playing against the [[Montreal Expos]] the Mets brought up future team captain David Wright but still finished with a 71\u201391 record in 2004.\n\n{{wikinews|Frank Messina: An interview with the 'Mets Poet'}}\nAfter the 2004 season, [[2004 New York Mets season|Mets]] ownership made significant changes to their management strategy. With their television contract with the [[Cablevision]] expiring at the end of 2005, they announced plans to establish their own cable network to broadcast Mets games. This investment in what became known as [[SportsNet New York]] was coupled with an aggressive plan to upgrade the performance of the team on the field. [[Jim Duquette]] was replaced as general manager by former Expos GM [[Omar Minaya]]. Minaya, an ex-Mets assistant GM, had achieved notable success in Montreal by making bold player moves on a limited budget. With the Mets, Minaya was given substantial financial resources to develop a winning team.\n\n====2005 season====\n{{Main|2005 New York Mets season}}\n\nMinaya began by hiring Yankee bench coach [[Willie Randolph]] as manager, then signed two of that year's most sought-after free agents&nbsp;\u2014 [[Pedro Mart\u00ednez]] and [[Carlos Beltr\u00e1n]]&nbsp;\u2014 to large multi-year deals.  Despite an 0\u20135 start to the [[2005 Major League Baseball season|season]], the team finished 83\u201379, finishing above the .500 mark for the first time since 2001. The 2005 season was also the last by [[Mike Piazza]] in a Mets uniform.\n\nDuring the 2005 offseason star first baseman [[Carlos Delgado]] and catcher [[Paul Lo Duca]] were acquired via trade and the Mets signed free agent closer [[Billy Wagner]].\n\n====2006 season====\n{{Main|2006 New York Mets season}}\n\nIn 2006, led by a franchise record six [[2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Stars]] (Beltran, Lo Duca, Reyes, Wright, [[Tom Glavine]], and Mart\u00ednez), the Mets won the division title, their first in 18 years. In a runaway similar to 1986, the Mets led the division from April 6 on, and only spent one day out of first the whole season. The Mets finished the season 12 games ahead of the [[2006 Philadelphia Phillies season|Phillies]], and with the best record in the [[National League]].  The turning point for the season was a June 9\u20131 road trip.  The 2006 season was also the first time that the Mets and [[2006 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] each won their respective divisions in the same year and both teams tied for the best record in baseball.\n\nThe Mets swept the [[2006 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] in the [[2006 National League Division Series]]. In the [[2006 National League Championship Series]], the Mets lost in seven games to the [[2006 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]], the eventual [[2006 World Series]] champions. Game 7 featured one of the most spectacular plays in postseason history when left fielder [[Endy Ch\u00e1vez]] leaped over the 8-foot (2.4 m)-high left field wall in the top of the sixth inning and caught the ball with the tip of his glove to rob Cardinals third baseman [[Scott Rolen]] of a two-run home run. Ch\u00e1vez then threw to the cutoff man second baseman [[Jos\u00e9 Valent\u00edn]], who threw to Carlos Delgado at first base, doubling off center fielder [[Jim Edmonds]] for an inning-ending double play. Ch\u00e1vez's effort was in vain, however, as [[Yadier Molina]]'s two-run home run in the ninth off of [[Aaron Heilman]] gave the Cardinals a 3\u20131 lead and Carlos Beltr\u00e1n took a curve ball from Cardinals closer [[Adam Wainwright]] for a called third strike with the bases loaded on a full count in the bottom of the 9th inning to end the Mets season.\n\n====2007 season====\n{{Main|2007 New York Mets season}}\n\nAfter their success in 2006, there were high expectations for the Mets in 2007, and they started the season strong. The Mets then had a 7-game lead in the division with 17 games to go. The Mets, however, would lose 12 of their final 17 games enabling the [[2007 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] to win the NL East by one game. The Mets were eliminated on the final day of the season as Tom Glavine allowed 7 runs to the [[2007 Florida Marlins season|Florida Marlins]] and only got through 1/3 of an inning in his final start as a Met.  The Mets became the first team in baseball history to blow a lead of seven or more games with only 17 games to play.<ref name=\"collapse\">{{cite news\n|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2007-09-30-nl-season-end-cover_N.htm\n|last=Ortiz\n|first=Jorge L.\n|title= Mets' historic fall highlights a crazy Sunday in the NL\n|agency=Associated Press\n|accessdate=March 5, 2008\n|date=October 1, 2007}}</ref>\n\n====2008 season====\n{{Main|2008 New York Mets season}}\nIn the 2007 offseason the team acquired two-time [[Cy Young Award]]-winning pitcher [[Johan Santana]] from the [[Minnesota Twins]] for outfielder [[Carlos G\u00f3mez]] and minor-league pitchers [[Philip Humber]], [[Deolis Guerra]] and [[Kevin Mulvey]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Twins agree to deal Santana to Mets for 4 prospects |first=Bob |last=Nightengale |work=[[USA Today]] |date=January 30, 2008 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2008-01-29-twins-mets-santana_N.htm?loc=interstitialskip# }}</ref>\n\nThe 2008 season marked the final season at [[Shea Stadium]], the team's home for 45 years.

In September the Mets had 3.5 game divisional lead over the [[2008 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] with 17 games left to play. However, the Mets lost 10 of their final 17 games. The Phillies went 13\u20134 during the same stretch and won the division (the Phillies went on to win the World Series). The Mets still remained in the NL Wild Card with the [[2008 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]] but on September 28, the final game played at Shea Stadium, the Mets were eliminated from playoff contention by losing to the [[2008 Florida Marlins season|Florida Marlins]] on the season's final day for the second straight season.\n\n====2009 season: Citi Field opens and the season of injuries====\n{{Main|2009 New York Mets season}}\n[[File:Citi Field Day.jpg|thumb|left|[[Citi Field]], home of the Mets beginning in 2009.]]\nTo improve the bullpen for the 2009 season, which was arguably the reason the Mets missed the playoffs in 2007 and 2008, the Mets signed free agent closer [[Francisco Rodr\u00edguez (Venezuelan pitcher)|Francisco Rodr\u00edguez]], who established a single-season major league record for saves (62) as a member of the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]] in 2008.  They also acquired setup man [[J. J. Putz]] from the [[Seattle Mariners]] in exchange for several players.\n\nThe 2009 season was the Mets' first season at [[Citi Field]], a retropark following current architectural trends in stadium design. It follows the brick and steel-truss trend begun by the Orioles at [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]] in 1992. The exterior facade resembles [[Ebbets Field]], former home of the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]]. The Mets' first exhibition game at Citi Field was played on April 3, 2009 against the [[2009 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]]. The first regular season home game was on April 13, 2009 against the [[2009 San Diego Padres season|San Diego Padres]], who spoiled the opener with a 6\u20135 win against the Mets. In that game, [[Jody Gerut]] of the Padres became the first player to open a new ballpark with a leadoff home run. On April 17, [[Gary Sheffield]], who just days earlier was signed by the Mets as a free agent, hit his [[500 home run club|500th home run]] against the [[2009 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]]. Sheffield became the first pinch hitter to reach this milestone, as well as the first to do it in a Mets uniform.\n\nThe 2009 season for the Mets was marred by numerous injuries suffered by its players, with 20 of them having been on the [[disabled list]] at one point or another during the season and losing star (and also replacement) players like [[J. J. Putz]], [[John Maine]], [[\u00d3liver P\u00e9rez]], [[Jos\u00e9 Reyes (shortstop)|Jos\u00e9 Reyes]], [[Carlos Beltr\u00e1n]], [[David Wright]], [[Carlos Delgado]], [[Johan Santana]], and [[Gary Sheffield]]. As a result, the Mets finished in fourth place, with a record of 70\u201392 and failed to qualify for the playoffs for the third straight season.

The Mets brought in [[Gary Matthews, Jr.]] to start in place of Carlos Beltr\u00e1n because of Beltran's surgery in February 2010.\n\nThe team won their first game of the season, beating the [[Florida Marlins]] by a score of 7\u20131 on April 5. On April 17, 2010, the Mets beat the St. Louis Cardinals 2\u20131 in 20 innings. This was the fourth game of at least 20 innings in Mets history, but their first win. On April 28, the Mets defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers 7\u20133 to complete a 9-1 homestand, tying a franchise record reached by the [[1969 New York Mets season|1969]] and [[1988 New York Mets season|1988]] teams.

On July 31 the Mets acquired all star outfielder [[Yoenis C\u00e9spedes]] who provided them with an undeniable spark. The Mets won the [[National League East]] Division title for the first time since 2006 after a 10\u20132 win against Cincinnati on September 26. They advanced to the [[2015 National League Division Series|NLDS]] to face the Los Angeles, winning in five games. They were carried by 2nd baseman Daniel Murphy who homered three times in the series. They then swept the Chicago Cubs in the [[2015 National League Championship Series|NLCS]] led by NLCS MVP Daniel Murphy, who batted .529 in the series and homered in each of the four games bringing a consecutive post game home run streak to six games, an MLB postseason record (Murphy homered a total of seven times in the two series).\n\nIn the [[2015 World Series|World Series]], they were defeated by the [[Kansas City Royals]] in five games.\n\n==== 2016 season: The Wild Card Game and Reyes Returns to Flushing ====\n\n==== 2017 season: The Year of Injury====\n\n=== 2018-2019: Mickey Callaway Era ===\n==== 2018 season: A Hot Start, A Dismal Season====\n\n==== 2019 season: More of the Same====\n[[Pete Alonso]] would win rookie of the year with a 53 home run performance.\n\n=== 2020-present: Luis Rojas Takes Over ===\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{MLBHistory}}\n{{New York Mets}}\n{{Subway Series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of The New York Mets}}\n[[Category:New York Mets]]\n[[Category:History of Major League Baseball by team|New York Mets]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2019}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|date=July 2010}}\n{{Original research|date=July 2010}}\n}}\n\nThe '''history of the [[New York Mets]]''' began in 1962 when the team was introduced as part of the [[National League]]'s first expansion of the 20th century.

Donald Grant]] became chairman of the board. Grant and Joan Payson had been the only members of the Giants' board to oppose the team's move west.\n\nThe two existing [[sports league|league]]s, which had considerably more autonomy at the time, responded with plans to add four new teams, two in each league. One of the new National League teams was to be in New York. The NL offered this new franchise to the CL's New York group, provided that they commit to building a new park. Shea told [[Mayor of New York City|New York Mayor]] [[Robert F. Wagner, Jr.]] that he had to personally cable all of the  National League team owners and guarantee that the city would build a new facility.\n\nThe new team required a new name, and many were suggested. Among the finalists were \"Bees\", \"[[donkey|Burro]]s\", \"Continentals\", \"Skyscrapers\", \"Skyliners\", and \"Jets\" (which would eventually be used by the [[New York Jets|city]]'s [[American Football League]] team), as well as the eventual runners-up, \"Empires\" and \"Islanders\" (the latter nickname would be used by a [[New York Islanders|future NHL team in the area]]).<ref name=\"Nickname\">{{cite news|title=New National League Team Here Approves Mets as Its Official Nickname|first=Louis|last=Effrat|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 9, 1961|page=48|authorlink=Louis Effrat}}</ref><ref name=Timeline1/> Although Payson had admitted a preference for \"[[Meadowlarks]]\", the owners ultimately selected \"Mets\",<ref name=newclubsname>{{cite news |title=New York Mets New Club's Name |agency=Associated Press |publisher=The Leader-Post, via Google News |date=May 9, 1961 |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pchUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DjwNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2799,2063241&dq=new+york+mets&hl=en }}</ref> because it was closely related to the club's already-existing corporate name, \"New York Metropolitan Baseball Club, Inc.\", it hearkened back to \"[[New York Metropolitans|Metropolitans]]\", a name used by an earlier New York team in the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] from 1880 to 1887,<ref name=newclubsname/> and because its brevity would naturally fit in newspaper headlines.<ref name=\"Nickname\"/> The name was received with broad approval among fans and the press.<ref name=Timeline1/>\n\nFrom the beginning, the Mets sought to appeal to the large contingent of former Giants and Dodgers fans.

In 1964, both teams moved into newly constructed [[Shea Stadium]] in [[Flushing Meadows]], Queens, where the Mets stayed through the 2008 season (the Jets would leave after the 1983 NFL season). In 2009, the club moved into [[Citi Field]], located adjacent to the former site of Shea Stadium.\n\nDuring their history, the Mets have won two [[World Series]] titles (1969 and 1986), five National League [[National League Championship Series|pennants]] (1969, 1973, 1986, 2000, 2015), and six [[National League East]] titles (1969, 1973, 1986, 1988, 2006, 2015). The Mets also qualified for the postseason as the National League [[MLB Wild Card|Wild Card]] team in 1999 and 2000.  The Mets have appeared in more World Series&nbsp;\u2014 five&nbsp;\u2014 than any other [[expansion team]] in Major League Baseball history. Their two championships equal the tally of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]], [[Florida Marlins]]  and [[Kansas City Royals]] for the most titles among expansion teams. The Mets are the only expansion team to have won two World Series championships at home, as the Blue Jays, Marlins and Royals have each won one on the road. (Blue Jays in {{wsy|1992}}, Marlins in {{wsy|2003}}, and the Royals in {{wsy|2015}}.)\n\nThe Mets held the New York baseball attendance record for 29 years. They broke the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]]' 1948 record by drawing nearly 2.7 million in 1970. The Mets broke their own record five times before the Yankees took it back in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYM/attend.shtml|title=New York Mets Attendance, Stadiums, and Park Factors|work=baseball-reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYY/attend.shtml|title=New York Yankees Attendance, Stadiums, and Park Factors|work=baseball-reference.com}}</ref>\n\nNo Met pitcher had ever thrown a [[no-hitter]] until June 1, 2012 when [[Johan Santana]] no-hit the Cardinals.

After the Mets got their first no-hitter, this left the [[San Diego Padres]] as the only remaining team in MLB that has never had a pitcher throw such a game.\n\n=== 1962\u20131966: The Lovable Losers ===\nIn October 1961, the [[National League]] held an [[expansion draft]] to stock the rosters of the Mets and the [[Houston Colt .45s]] with players from other clubs. 22 players were selected by the Mets, including some with notable previous success such as [[Roger Craig (baseball)|Roger Craig]], [[Al Jackson]], [[Frank Thomas (outfielder)|Frank Thomas]], and [[Richie Ashburn]]. But rather than select talented young players with future potential, Mets management preferred to sign faded stars of the Dodgers and Giants to appeal to fans' nostalgia. Legendary Yankees manager [[Casey Stengel]] was hired out of retirement to lead the team,<ref name=Stengel/> but his managerial acumen wasn't enough to overcome the severe deficiency of talent among the players.\n\n====1962\u201363====\nThe [[1962 New York Mets season|Mets]] took the field for the first time on April 11, 1962 against the [[1962 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] (the first game, scheduled for April 10, was delayed due to rain).<ref>{{cite news|title=Mets Rained Out of St. Louis Game|date=April 11, 1962|first=Louis|last=Effrat|newspaper=New York Times|page=52|authorlink=Louis Effrat}}</ref><ref name=FirstGame>{{cite news|title=Cardinals Spoil Mets' Debut With 11-4 Victory on 16 Hits Off 4 Pitchers|date=April 12, 1962|first=Louis|last=Effrat|newspaper=New York Times|page=44|authorlink=Louis Effrat}}</ref> One apocryphal legend has it that in the first game, pitcher Roger Craig went into his windup with the Cardinals' [[Bill White (first baseman)|Bill White]] on third\u2014and dropped the ball.

Journeyman players like the ironically nicknamed [[Marv Throneberry|\"Marvelous Marv\" Throneberry]] became icons of athletic incompetence. Ex-Dodger and Giant pitcher [[Billy Loes]], who was acquired by the Mets after the 1961 expansion draft, was credited with the ungrammatical \"The Mets is a good thing. They give everybody jobs. Just like the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]].\" Even the young Mets proved to have standards, however. In 1962, [[Cleveland Indians]] [[Catcher (baseball)|catcher]] [[Harry Chiti]] was purchased by the Mets for a [[player to be named later]] in the season. After only 15 games and a .195 batting average, the Mets sent him back to the Indians; he never played in another major league game again. Chiti was the first player ever to be sent back to his original team in a trade in Major League history.\n\nThe [[1963 New York Mets season|1963 Mets]] featured a pitcher, Carlton Willey, who was having a great year, pitching four shut-outs, when he incurred an injury and finished with a 9\u201314 win-loss record. The '63 squad also had [[Duke Snider]] who hit his 2,000th hit and later his 400th home run and earned a berth to the 1963 All-Star Game.\n\n====1964====\n{{Main|1964 New York Mets season}}\n\nOn May 26, 1964, in Chicago, they played like champions (at least for one game) and pummeled the [[1964 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]], 19\u20131. According to legend, later that day a fan called a New York newspaper to get the score. He was told: \"They scored 19 runs.\" There was a long silence, then the fan asked: \"Did they win?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://live.msgnetwork.com/content_news.jsp?articleID=v0000msgn20050902T222409167&newsgroup=columnist.article&team=Mets&sports=baseball|last=Loughlin|first=Matt|title=One small step for a kid from Queens|work=MSGNetwork.com|date=September 3, 2005|authorlink=Matt Loughlin|access-date=April 26, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714123320/http://live.msgnetwork.com/content_news.jsp?articleID=v0000msgn20050902T222409167&newsgroup=columnist.article&team=Mets&sports=baseball|archive-date=July 14, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1964, the Mets, who played their first two seasons in the old [[Polo Grounds]], the former home of the Giants, moved to the newly constructed [[Shea Stadium]], a 55,300-seat multipurpose facility built in the [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]] neighborhood of the [[Borough (New York City)|Borough]] of [[Queens]], adjacent to the site of the [[1939 New York World's Fair|1939]] and [[1964 New York World's Fair]]s.\n\nOne high point of Shea Stadium's first season came on [[Father's Day]], when [[1964 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] pitcher [[Jim Bunning]] threw a perfect game against the [[1964 New York Mets season|Mets]], the first in the National League since 1880. For perhaps the only time in the stadium's history, the Shea faithful found themselves rooting for the visitors, caught up in the rare achievement, and roaring for Bunning on every pitch in the ninth inning.<ref>{{cite news|quote=The Phils won the contest...before 32,904 fans who were screaming for Bunning during the last two innings...Yesterday's perfect pitching turned the usually loyal Met fans into Bunning fans in the late innings.

Another high point was Shea Stadium's hosting of the [[1964 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]]. Unexpectedly thrust into the spotlight in the final hectic weekend of the 1964 season, the Mets relished the role of spoiler, beating the [[1964 St. Louis Cardinals season|Cardinals]] in [[Busch Memorial Stadium|St. Louis]] on Friday and Saturday (keeping alive the hopes of the Phillies, Giants, and Reds) before succumbing to the eventual National League and World Series champions on Sunday.\n\n====1966====\n{{Main|1966 New York Mets season}}\n\nThe Mets' image as [[lovable loser]]s was wearing a little thin as the decade progressed, but things began to change slowly in the late 1960s. In 1966, the Mets chose catcher [[Steve Chilcott]] as the first overall selection in the [[1966 Major League Baseball draft|amateur draft]]. He became the first number one draft pick to retire without reaching the major leagues. The second pick that year was Hall of Famer [[Reggie Jackson]]. That year, the Mets went 66-95, the first season they did not finish with 100+ losses.\n\n=== Hodges, Seaver and Koosman ===\nThe Mets acquired top pitching prospect [[Tom Seaver]] in a lottery and he became the league's [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] in 1967. Even though the Mets remained in last place, Tom Seaver was a sign of good fortune to come. He was originally signed by the [[Atlanta Braves]] in February 1966 out of the [[University of Southern California]], but his contract was voided by [[Commissioner of Baseball|Commissioner]] [[William Eckert]] on the basis that the [[USC Trojans baseball|USC season]] had already started when Seaver signed. In order to resolve this issue, the Mets, Indians, and Phillies were all placed in a hat since they were the only teams willing to match the Braves offer, and the Mets were fortunate enough to win the drawing. In addition to Seaver, two other young players were catcher [[Jerry Grote]] and shortstop [[Bud Harrelson]]. This trio of youth formed a new, determined clubhouse nucleus that had no interest in losing, lovably or otherwise. By the 1968 season, [[Wes Westrum]] would be replaced as manager by [[Gil Hodges]]. Pitcher [[Jerry Koosman]] joined the staff and had a spectacular rookie season in 1967, winning 19 games. Left fielder [[Cleon Jones]] developed as a batter and exciting center fielder [[Tommie Agee]] came over in a trade. But although much improved, the [[1968 New York Mets season|1968 team]] still finished the season in 9th place.\n\n=== 1969\u20131972: The Amazin' or Miracle Mets ===\n{{Main|1969 New York Mets season}}\n\nThe Mets began the 1969 season in a mediocre way: an opening day home loss of 11\u201310 to the expansion [[1969 Montreal Expos season|Montreal Expos]] was followed by a record of 21\u201323 through the end of May. On April 10, 1969 [[Tommie Agee]] became the only player ever to hit a home run to the small area of fair territory in the upper level of Shea Stadium. A painted sign on the stands nearby commemorated the spot at Shea.  By mid-August, the favored [[1969 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] seemed safely on their way to winning the first ever National League East Division title (and their first postseason appearance of any kind since [[1945 World Series|1945]]). The Mets sat in third place, ten games behind; but Chicago went 8\u201317 in September, while the Mets, with outstanding pitching from their young staff, piled up victory after victory, winning 38 of their last 49 games. They took first place for good on September 10, and finished in first place with a 100\u201362 record for the season, their first winning year ever, a full eight games over the Cubs. The Mets finished with a team ERA of 2.99, and a league leading 28 shutouts thrown. Tom Seaver led the way with a 25\u20137 record, with lefty [[Jerry Koosman]] behind him at 17\u20139 record, while [[Cleon Jones]] finished with a .340 batting average. Seaver's best game occurred on July 9, at Shea Stadium, where he came within two outs of a perfect game, but gave up a one-out, ninth-inning single to the Cubs' Jimmy Qualls for the only hit in the Mets' 4\u20130 victory.\n\nThe \"Miracle Mets\" or \"Amazin Mets\", as they became known by the press, went on to win a three-game sweep of the strong [[1969 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]], led by legend [[Hank Aaron|Henry \"Hank\" Aaron]], in the very first [[1969 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]]. The Mets were considered underdogs in this series despite the fact that they had a better record than the Braves, the first place team in the National League West.\n\n[[File:Shea Stadium 1969.jpeg|thumb|250px|Shea Stadium prior to a Mets versus Philadelphia Phillies game in 1969.]]\n\nThe Mets were given very little chance in the [[1969 World Series]], facing a powerful [[1969 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]] team that had gone 109\u201353 in the regular season and included [[Frank Robinson]], [[Brooks Robinson]], and [[Jim Palmer]] as well as future Mets manager [[Davey Johnson]], who would make the final out of the Series. Before the series began, pundits predicted Tom Seaver might win the opening game, but that the Mets would have trouble winning again in the World Series. As it turned out, just the opposite occurred; Seaver was roughed up, allowing four runs in the opener, which he lost&nbsp;\u2014 but the Mets' pitching shut down the Orioles after that, holding them to just five runs over the next four games, to win the World Series 4 games to 1. Seaver got his revenge in game four, pitching all 10 innings of a 2\u20131 victory.\n\nFor longtime Mets announcer [[Ralph Kiner]] and many fans, the turning point in the team's season, came in the third inning of the second game of a July 30 doubleheader against the [[1969 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros]]. When left fielder Cleon Jones failed to hustle after a ball hit to the outfield, Mets manager Gil Hodges removed him from the game&nbsp;\u2014 but rather than simply signal from the dugout for Jones to come out, or delegate the job to one of his coaches, Hodges left the dugout and slowly, deliberately, walked all the way out to left field to Jones, and walked him back to the bench. For the rest of that season, Jones never failed to hustle.\n\nThe Miracle Mets magic wore off as the 1970s began. They would continue to produce winning seasons, but did not repeat the success of their championship season. In these subsequent years, Mets pitchers generally excelled but received lackluster support from the hitters, with mediocre finishes the result. Efforts to improve the offense backfired with blunders such as trading [[Amos Otis]] for troubled infielder [[Joe Foy]] after the 1969 season as well as young pitcher [[Nolan Ryan]] for infielder [[Jim Fregosi]] after the 1971 season. Once out of the glaring New York spotlight, Ryan became one of the best pitchers in history, spending 22 more years in the majors and entering the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1999 as a [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Ranger]]. Fregosi battled injuries and played just 146 games for the Mets over a season and a half. Meanwhile, Otis became a star with the [[Kansas City Royals]] while Foy lasted only one season in New York.\n\nThe team was thrown into confusion and shock prior to the 1972 season, when Manager [[Gil Hodges]], who had led the team to the World Series victory in 1969, suffered a sudden heart attack at the end of spring training and died. Coach [[Yogi Berra]] succeeded Hodges.\n\n===1973: \"Ya Gotta Believe!\"===\n[[File:Mets home run apple.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The home run apple in Shea Stadium]]\n{{Main|1973 New York Mets season}}\nDespite high hopes following the 1969 championship season, the Mets could not break through to the postseason in the early '70s, coming up short three times. Then, in 1973, the Mets found themselves deadlocked with their opponents in what was then the tightest divisional race of the century. Despite going .600 for the month of April, the team then floundered as the season progressed. Hampered with many injuries,  Berra's Mets found themselves in last place with a 61\u201371 record at the end of August 1973, but when they got healthy again, they recovered behind relief pitcher [[Tug McGraw]] and his '''\"Ya gotta believe!\"''' rallying cry (a phrase the team has since [[trademark]]ed), winning 21 of their last 29 games. Berra also coined his most famous [[Yogi Berraism|Yogiism]] that year: '''\"It ain't over till it's over!\"''' Their final record of only 82\u201379 was good enough to win the division while five better teams missed the postseason. Despite the second-worst winning percentage ever by a division winner (until the [[2005 San Diego Padres season|2005 San Diego Padres]]), the Mets stunned the heavily favored [[1973 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] \"[[The Big Red Machine|Big Red Machine]]\" in the [[1973 National League Championship Series|NLCS]], beating them in 5 games. Their record remains the lowest of any pennant-winning team but they managed to push the defending World Series Champion [[1973 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] to a seventh game. Their near-miracle season ended with a loss to [[Ken Holtzman]] in the final contest.\n\nThis was the only NL East title between 1970 and 1980 that wasn't won by either the [[Phillies\u2013Pirates rivalry|Philadelphia Phillies or the Pittsburgh Pirates]].<ref name=ExclusiveReign>{{cite web|url=http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050707&content_id=1119893&vkey=news_phi&fext=.jsp&c_id=phi|title=Notes: Phils\u2013Pirates rivalry fading|date=July 7, 2005|accessdate=January 3, 2011|first=George|last=Von Benko|work=Phillies.MLB.com|quote=From 1974-80, the [[Philadelphia Phillies|Phillies]] and [[Pittsburgh Pirates|Pirates]] won all seven National League East titles (Phillies four, Pirates three).}}</ref><ref name=PiratesFirstThreePeat>{{cite news|title=Pirates perform rare three-peat feat 4\u20132|date=September 28, 1992|newspaper=USA Today|page=5C|quote=The Pirates...won three (NL East titles) in a row from 1970-72.}}</ref> Those two teams reigned exclusively as NL East champions during that span (Pirates from [[1970 Pittsburgh Pirates season|1970]]\u2013[[1972 Pittsburgh Pirates season|1972]] and won the [[1971 World Series]], [[1974 Pittsburgh Pirates season|1974]], [[1975 Pittsburgh Pirates season|1975]], and winning the [[1979 World Series]], Phillies from [[1976 Philadelphia Phillies season|1976]]\u2013[[1978 Philadelphia Phillies season|1978]] and winning the [[1980 World Series]]).<ref name=ExclusiveReign/><ref name=PiratesFirstThreePeat/>\n\n===1974-1979: The Midnight Massacre and Dark Ages===\nAfter the Mets' 1973 pennant-winning season, the team fell out of contention. They fell below .500 for the first time in six years, and though they resumed their winning ways in 1975 and 1976, they never came close to winning the NL East. As the 1975 season ended, owner Joan Payson died, leaving the team to her husband Charles. While Joan Payson had been the driving force behind the Mets, her successors did not share her enthusiasm. Charles delegated his authority to his three daughters, who in turn left control over baseball matters to club chairman Grant. Contract disputes with star pitcher [[Tom Seaver]] and slugger [[Dave Kingman]] erupted in 1977. These disputes came to a head when both players were traded on June 15, the trading deadline, to the Cincinnati Reds and San Diego Padres, respectively, in what New York [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]s dubbed \"The Midnight Massacre.\" The Mets received six players in the two deals, but none had any lasting impact. Attendance dropped, to the point where Shea Stadium was nicknamed \"Grant's Tomb.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Jerry's Name in the Lineup; Sports of The Times Broadway Willie Baseball's Bill Blass|first=Red|last=Smith|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 8, 1978|page=15|authorlink=Red Smith (sportswriter)}}</ref> Coincidentally, the Yankees began their resurgence at roughly the same time, further eroding the Mets' fan base.\n\nThe [[1978 New York Mets season|team]] finished in last place yet again in 1978. By this time, it was obvious that Grant had mismanaged the team and failed to invest in its future. Charles Payson himself fired Grant at the end of the season. Things only got worse in 1979: The Mets were in last place before the end of April, and attendance dropped below 1 million for the first time in history. They would not become a competitive team again until the mid-1980s, marking the first time that both New York teams were competitive at the same time, both on the field and at the box office.\n\n=== 1980-1984: Doubleday, Strawberry, and Gooden ===\n[[File:Shea 10-12-07.jpg|thumb|[[Shea Stadium]] was the Mets' home from 1964 to 2008.]]\nIn January 1980, the Payson heirs sold the Mets franchise to the [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] publishing company for $21.1 million, a record amount at that time. [[Nelson Doubleday, Jr.]] was named chairman of the board while minority shareholder [[Fred Wilpon]] took the role of club president. In February, Wilpon hired longtime [[Baltimore Orioles]] executive [[Frank Cashen]] as general manager who began the process of rebuilding the Mets much in the same way he developed the Orioles in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nCashen's positive impact on the organization took some time to be felt at the major league level. He began by selecting slugging high school phenomenon [[Darryl Strawberry]] as the number one overall pick in the [[1980 Major League Baseball draft|1980 amateur draft]]. Two years later, hard-throwing hurler [[Dwight Gooden]] was taken as the fifth overall selection in the [[1982 Major League Baseball draft|1982 draft]]. The pair rose quickly through the minors, winning consecutive [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] awards (Strawberry in 1983, Gooden in 1984). Cashen's mid-season 1983 trade for former [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] [[Keith Hernandez]] from the Cardinals helped spark the Mets' return to competitive contention. After finishing their first three campaigns of the 1980s decade in either 5th or 6th (last) place, in 1984, new manager [[Davey Johnson]] was promoted from the helm of the AAA [[Norfolk Tides|Tidewater Tides]] and led the Mets to a 90\u201372 record, their first winning season since 1976.\n\n=== 1985-1988: \"Party Hard; Play Harder\" Era ===\n\n====1985====\n{{Main|1985 New York Mets season}}\nIn 1985, the Mets acquired catcher [[Gary Carter]] from the [[Montreal Expos]] and won 98 games, but lost the division title to the [[1985 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] in the final days of the season in a memorable series. The Mets began the series three games behind St. Louis and won the first two, but faltered in the third game, allowing St. Louis to remain in first place and clinch the division.\n\n====1986: World Champions again====\n{{Main|1986 New York Mets season}}\nBefore the 1986 season, Doubleday sold his publishing company to the (then) West German multinational corporation [[Bertelsmann AG]], and used the proceeds from the sale to buy the Mets in his own name for $81 million.  He then sold a half-stake to Wilpon, making them equal partners in the team.\n\nUnlike the league champion Mets of 1969 or 1973, the 1986 Mets broke away from the rest of the division early and dominated throughout the entire year. They won 20 of their first 24 games, clinched the East Division title on September 17, and finished the year 108\u201354, which tied with the [[1975 Cincinnati Reds season|1975 Cincinnati Reds]] for the third highest win total in National League history, behind the [[1906 Chicago Cubs season|1906 Chicago Cubs]] (116) and the [[1909 Pittsburgh Pirates season|1909 Pittsburgh Pirates]] (110). The relative lack of excitement during the regular season was more than compensated for by the spectacularly suspenseful and dramatic post-season series.\n\nIn the [[1986 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]], the Mets faced their fellow 1962 expansion team, the [[1986 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros]]. Unlike the Mets, the Astros had yet to win a pennant, but had former Mets pitchers [[Mike Scott (baseball)|Mike Scott]], the league's [[Cy Young Award]] winner, and [[fireballer]] [[Nolan Ryan]] leading their pitching staff. The Mets took a two-games-to-one lead with a come-from-behind [[walk-off home run]] by [[Lenny Dykstra]]. In Game 6, the Mets turned a 3\u20130 ninth-inning deficit into a sixteen-inning marathon victory to clinch the National League pennant and earn their third [[World Series]] appearance. The Astros would have to wait until [[2005 National League Championship Series|2005]] to finally win their first pennant.\n\nIn the [[1986 World Series|World Series]] against the [[1986 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]], the Mets faced elimination leading into Game 6. The Red Sox scored two runs in the 10th inning and twice came within one strike of winning their first World Series since {{wsy|1918}}. However, the Mets rallied and would come back in typical Amazin' Mets fashion, as the game became one of the most famous games in baseball history as the [[Curse of the Bambino]] appeared to be alive and well. In fact, it was in this series that talk of this curse began.<ref>{{cite news|title=SPORTS OF THE TIMES; [[Babe Ruth]] Curse Strikes Again|date=October 28, 1986|first=George|last=Vecsey|work=The New York Times|page=D33|authorlink=George Vecsey}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/playoffs/2004-10-27-ws-game4_x.htm\n|title=Curse RIP: 1918\u20132004; After decades of pain, Red Sox on top of world|date=October 28, 2004|first=Mike|last=Dodd|newspaper=USA Today|quote=The Curse of the Bambino, said to have started after Red Sox owner [[Harry Frazee]] sold Babe Ruth to the Yankees after the [[1919 Major League Baseball season|1919 season]]...soared in popularity after the Sox came within one strike of winning the 1986 Series, only to collapse as a ground ball went between first baseman Bill Buckner's legs.|page=C1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|page=[https://archive.org/details/reversingcursein00shau/page/11 11]|title=Reversing the Curse|first=Dan|last=Shaughnessy|year=2005|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=New York|isbn=0-618-51748-0|authorlink=Dan Shaughnessy|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/reversingcursein00shau/page/11}}</ref>\n\nWith two outs and down two runs, three consecutive singles brought the Mets within {{convert|90|ft|m}} of knotting the score. Hitter [[Mookie Wilson]] ran the count to 2\u20131, then fouled off 3 consecutive pitches. With the count 2\u20132, pitcher [[Bob Stanley (baseball)|Bob Stanley]] threw a wild pitch that Wilson had to leap out of the way of. Boston catcher [[Rich Gedman]] made a wild stab for the ball but it went to the backstop. Pinch hitter [[Kevin Mitchell (baseball)|Kevin Mitchell]] scored from third base, tying the game.\n\nNow facing a full count, Wilson fouled off two more pitches. On [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]], [[Vin Scully]] then called a play that would quickly become an iconic one to baseball fans, with the normally calm Scully growing increasingly excited: {{Cquote|So the winning run is at second base, with two outs, three and two to Mookie Wilson. (A) little roller up along first... ''behind the bag! It gets through [[Bill Buckner|Buckner]]! Here comes [[Ray Knight|Knight]], and the Mets win it!''}}\n\nScully then remained silent for more than three minutes, letting the pictures and the crowd noise tell the story. Scully resumed with: {{cquote|If one picture is worth a thousand words, you have seen about a million words, but more than that, you have seen an absolutely bizarre finish to Game 6 of the 1986 World Series. The Mets are not only alive, they are well, and they will play the [[1986 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] in Game 7 tomorrow!}}\n\nThe Mets went on to win their second World Series title by taking Game 7, also in dramatic fashion, overcoming a 3 run deficit while scoring a total of 8 runs during the final 3 innings. The final score was 8\u20135 with Mets' pitcher Jesse Orosco ending the game by striking out Marty Barrett. Orosco then threw his glove high in the air and dropped to his knees while catcher Gary Carter ran to the mound to embrace him.  This scene was captured on film and would become an iconic image, taken by Mets photographer [[George Kalinsky]], in Mets baseball history and in all of baseball. The Mets remained the only team to come within one strike of losing a World Series before recovering to become World Champions, until the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] did it in 2011. The Mets winning this World Series is the highest-rated single World Series game to date. The Mets were also the first team to win a World Series in a potential clinching game delayed by rain, as Game 7 was postponed by one day.<ref>{{cite news|page=217|quote=The Phillies were the first team to have a potential clinching game in the World Series delayed by rain since the Mets and the Red Sox had to wait an extra day before playing Game 7 of the 1986 World Series, thanks to A) Bill Buckner (and accomplices) and B) a rainout the night after the Buckner game.|title=Worth The Wait: Tales of the 2008 Phillies|first=Jayson|last=Stark|isbn=1-60078-273-6|publisher=Triumph Books|year=2009|authorlink=Jayson Stark}}</ref>\n\nWhile the team around the 1986 championship was strong, they also became infamous for off-the-field controversy. Both Strawberry and Gooden were youngsters who wound up burning out long before their time because of various substance abuse and personal problems. Hernandez's cocaine abuse was the subject of persistent rumors even before he joined the Mets, but he publicly acknowledged his addiction in 1985 and made a successful recovery. Lenny Dykstra's reputation was recently tainted by allegations of [[steroid]] use and [[gambling]] problems.<ref name=\"USATodaySteroids\">{{cite news\n|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2005-04-24-dykstra-steroids_x.htm\n|title=Report: Lawsuit alleges Dykstra used steroids, gambled\n|work=[[USA Today]]\n|accessdate=June 17, 2006\n|date=April 24, 2005}}</ref>\nInstead of putting together a winning dynasty, the problems caused the Mets to soon fall apart.<ref name=\"SIFlashback\">{{cite news\n|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/news/2000/02/23/strawberry_flashback_95\n|last=Verducci\n|first=Tom\n|title=High Price of Hard Living\n|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]\n|accessdate=June 17, 2006\n|date=February 27, 1995}}</ref>\nDespite Darryl Strawberry's numerous off-the-field mishaps, he remains the Mets' all-time leader in home runs and runs batted in.\n\nThis World Series championship by the Mets had a strange twist: [[Lou Gorman]], the general manager of the Red Sox, was vice president, player personnel, of the Mets from 1980 to 1983. Working under Mets' GM [[Frank Cashen]], with whom Gorman served with the Orioles, he helped lay the foundation for the Mets' championship.\n\n====1987====\n{{Main|1987 New York Mets season}}\n\nAfter winning the World Series in 1986 the Mets declined to re-sign World Series MVP [[Ray Knight]], who then signed with the [[Baltimore Orioles]]. Also, they traded the flexible [[Kevin Mitchell (baseball)|Kevin Mitchell]] to the Padres for long-ball threat [[Kevin McReynolds]]. But the biggest shock since the Midnight Massacre of 1977 was when Mets' ace Dwight Gooden was admitted to a drug clinic after testing positive for cocaine. But after struggling in the first few months of the 1987 season, \"Dr. K\" would come back, and so would the Mets. It was during the tough times that the Mets made a great long-term deal, trading [[Ed Hearn (catcher)|Ed Hearn]] to the [[Kansas City Royals]] for pitcher [[David Cone]]. They would surge to battle [[1987 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis]] for the division title. They would have two tough losses to the Cardinals. The first came on [[Seat Cushion Night]] where [[Tom Herr]] hit a walk-off grand slam. But the worst loss came on September 11 in a game against St. Louis, 3rd baseman [[Terry Pendleton]] hit a homer to give the Cardinals a lead, and eventually the NL East title. One highlight of the year was [[Darryl Strawberry]] and [[Howard Johnson (baseball)|Howard Johnson]] becoming the first teammates' ever to hit 30 homers and steal 30 bases in the same season.\n\n====1988====\n{{Main|1988 New York Mets season}}\n\nAfter missing the playoffs in 1987, the 1988 Mets again won the division. Thanks to some stellar pitching from Gooden, [[Ron Darling]], and [[David Cone]] as well as offense from McReynolds, Strawberry, and Howard Johnson, the Mets won 100 games for the 2nd time in 3 campaigns (to date, 1988 is also the last time they have finished with that many wins). In addition, Strawberry and McReynolds both lost the MVP to [[Kirk Gibson]] as they finished 2nd and 3rd in the voting, respectively. Despite this, however, the clubhouse was distracted by the presence of a young [[Gregg Jefferies]] who was just called up. The veteran players took a dislike to Jefferies, who had a habit of excessive bragging, prompting his teammates to saw his custom-made bats in half as a form of hazing.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.projo.com/cgi-bin/include.pl/redsox/crank/main.htm | title=Underappreciated Teams | last=McLaughlin | first=Dan | date=February 28, 2003 | work=[[The Providence Journal]]}}</ref>  The Mets played the [[1988 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] in the [[1988 National League Championship Series]] in a season where they beat them 10 out of 11 times but, led by [[Orel Hershiser]], the Dodgers continued their [[cinderella (sports)|Cinderella story season]] by beating the Mets in seven games.\n\n===1989\u20131990: The Championship Team Disassembles===\nThe 1989 Mets began with a slow start, thanks to an infamous Picture Day brawl between [[Darryl Strawberry]] and [[Keith Hernandez]], apparently because Hernandez told reporters that [[Kevin McReynolds]] should win the 1988 NL MVP over Strawberry (although Los Angeles' [[Kirk Gibson]] would beat both Mets for the award). Eventually, the Mets (as well as the [[1989 Montreal Expos season|Montreal Expos]]) would battle the [[1989 Chicago Cubs season|Cubs]] for the division title in 1989, but Chicago would prevail, despite a career year by Howard Johnson and a deadline trade with [[Minnesota Twins|Minnesota]] for 1988 AL Cy Young winner [[Frank Viola]].

After the season, Samuel, who hit .235 that season, would be traded to the Dodgers for [[Mike Marshall (outfielder)|Mike Marshall]], who would hit .239 in 53 games for the Mets before being traded to Boston. Dykstra, however, would become an All-Star in Philadelphia and help lead his team to a pennant in 1993.\n\nThat offseason, the Mets had a mix of triumph and tragedy. They would receive All-Star closer and native New Yorker [[John Franco]] in a trade with the [[Cincinnati Reds]], and Strawberry, in legal trouble as well, would check into an alcohol rehabilitation center and miss the start of the season. They would also lose key veterans [[Gary Carter]] and [[Keith Hernandez]] as they left for the Giants and Indians in free agency, respectively. The next season, the Mets would surge again to battle the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], by September 3 had a 77-55 record a half game lead, but Pittsburgh's \"B-B Guns\" (which included [[Barry Bonds]], [[Bobby Bonilla]], [[Jay Bell]] and now former Met Wally Backman) led the Pirates to their first NLCS since 1979. In that campaign, general manager [[Frank Cashen]] fired Johnson from his managerial job and replaced him with former shortstop [[Bud Harrelson]]. Although he led them to a good finish in 1990 (Strawberry's last with the Mets, as he went on to sign with the Dodgers in the offseason), the Mets fell to 5th place in 1991. Before the 1991 season the Mets signed [[Vince Coleman]] to a $2 million contract after failing to sign defending batting champion [[Willie McGee]] (who went to San Francisco). This was the first of what would lead to many bad free agent signings and trades that would doom the Mets during the mid-1990s.\n\n===1991\u20131993: ''The Worst Team Money Could Buy''===\n\n====1991\u201392====\nDuring the 1991 season, the [[1991 New York Mets season|Mets]] were actually in contention for the first half of the season, closing to within 2.5 games of the front-running [[1991 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pirates]] at one point. In the latter half, however, the bottom completely fell out and Harrelson was fired with a week left to go in the season, replaced by third base coach [[Mike Cubbage]] for the final games. Jefferies was once again a distraction as he released a controversial statement to be read on [[WFAN]] radio: \"When a pitcher is having trouble getting players out, when a hitter is having trouble hitting, or when a player makes an error, I try to support them in whatever way I can. I don't run to the media to belittle them or to draw more attention to their difficult times. I can only hope that one day those teammates who have found it convenient to criticize me will realize that we are all in this together. If only we can concentrate more on the games, rather than complaining and bickering and pointing fingers, we would all be better off.\"''<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/25/sports/heartfelt-plea-vintage-whine-jefferies-writes-fans.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm Heartfelt Plea?

The season ended on a high note, however, as [[David Cone]] pitched a one-hit shutout against the [[1991 Philadelphia Phillies season|Phillies]] at [[Veterans Stadium]], in which he struck out 19 batters, tying the National League regulation game record (first set by former Met [[Tom Seaver]]).\n\nWith all of the personal problems swirling around the Mets after the 1986 championship, the Mets tried to rebuild using experienced superstars. They picked up [[Eddie Murray]] for over $3 million, [[Bobby Bonilla]] for over $6 million. They also traded McReynolds and Jefferies for one-time World Series hero [[Bret Saberhagen]] and his $3 million contract, along with signing veteran free agent pitcher [[Frank Tanana]] for $1.5 million. The rebuilding was supported by the slogan, \"Hardball Is Back\".<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEEDF1230F935A15750C0A965958260 THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING \u2013 ADDENDA; A New Approach For the Mets], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 26, 1993</ref>\n\nThe experiment of building a team via free agency quickly flopped as Saberhagen and Coleman were soon injured and spent more time on the disabled list than on the field, and Bonilla exhibited unprofessional behavior towards members of the press, once threatening a reporter by saying, \"I'll show you The Bronx\" [http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/readers/signings.html]. At the beginning of the 1991 season, Coleman, Gooden and outfielder [[Daryl Boston]] were named in an alleged sexual abuse incident against a woman near the Mets' spring training facility; charges were later dropped. Meanwhile, popular pitcher [[David Cone]] was dealt to the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] during the 1992 season for [[Ryan Thompson (baseball)|Ryan Thompson]] and [[Jeff Kent]]. While the move was widely criticized by fans of both teams, the Jays went on to win the [[1992 World Series]].  Their descent was chronicled by the book ''The Worst Team Money Could Buy: The Collapse Of The New York Mets'' ({{ISBN|0-8032-7822-5}}) by Mets beat writers [[Bob Klapisch]] and John Harper.\n\n====1993====\n{{Main|1993 New York Mets season}}\n\nThe lowest point of the experiment was the 1993 season when the Mets lost 103 games. In April of that year, Coleman accidentally hit Gooden's shoulder with a golf club while practicing his swing. In July, Saberhagen threw a firecracker under a table near reporters. Their young pitching prospect [[Anthony Young (baseball)|Anthony Young]] started the '93 season at 0\u201313 and his overall streak of 27 straight losses over two years set a new record. After Young's record-setting loss, Coleman threw a firecracker out of the team bus window and injured three people resulting in felony charges that effectively ended his Mets career; the Mets placed him on paid administrative leave for the remainder of the season, and announced less than a month before the end of the season that he would never play for them again. Only a few days later, Saberhagen was in trouble again, this time for spraying [[bleach]] at three reporters. The meltdown season resulted in the worst record for a Mets team since 1965. In addition, two of the three remaining links to the '86 team, [[Howard Johnson (baseball)|Howard Johnson]] and [[Sid Fernandez]], departed after the season via free agency.\n\n===1994 strike-shortened season===\n{{Main|1994 New York Mets season}}\n[[File:New York Mets at Chicago Cubs 1994-04-04 (ticket).jpg|thumb|right|275px|A ticket for the Mets' 1994 [[Opening Day]] game against the [[Chicago Cubs]].]]\nThe [[1994 Major League Baseball season|following season]] was filled with some bright spots, but there was still trouble for the franchise, and for the team's franchise player. Gooden, who had a 3\u20134 record with a 6.31 ERA in the final year of his contract with the team, shocked not only New York sports fans, but baseball fans around the country by testing positive for [[cocaine]] and was suspended by Major League Baseball for 60 days. Shortly after he began serving his suspension for the positive drug test, it was announced that he had again tested positive for cocaine and was now being suspended by Major League Baseball for one year, thus ending his Mets career and nearly his life. The day after receiving the second suspension, Gooden's then-wife, Monica, found him in his bedroom with a loaded gun to his head.\n\nStill, the 1994 season saw some promise for the troubled Mets, as first baseman [[Rico Brogna]] and second baseman [[Jeff Kent]] became fan favorites with their solid glove work and potential 20\u201325 home run power, Bonilla started to become the player the Mets expected, and a healthy Saberhagen, along with promising young starter [[Bobby Jones (right-handed pitcher)|Bobby Jones]] and John Franco, helped the Mets pitching staff along. In the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|strike-shortened]] 1994 season the Mets were in 3rd place behind first-place [[1994 Montreal Expos season|Montreal]] and [[1994 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta]] when the season ended on August 12.\n\n===1995\u20131997: Working Their Way Back===\n\n====1995 season====\n{{Main|1995 New York Mets season}}\n\nWhen the strike finally ended in 1995, the Mets finally showed some promise again, finishing in 2nd place (but still 6 games under .500) behind eventual World Series champion Atlanta.\n\nThe 1995 season marked the emergence of pitchers [[Bill Pulsipher]], [[Jason Isringhausen]], and [[Paul Wilson (baseball)|Paul Wilson]]. The trio were dubbed [[Generation K (baseball)|Generation K]], a group of talented young hurlers who were destined to bring the Mets into greatness, much like Tom Seaver, Jerry Koosman and [[Nolan Ryan]] did in the 1960s. However, all three players succumbed to injury, preventing them from reaching their full potential. Of the three of them, only Isringhausen would accomplish much of significance in the majors, but as a reliever, eventually reaching 300 career saves.\n\n====1996 season====\n{{Main|1996 New York Mets season}}\n\nThe Mets dismal 1996 season was highlighted by the play of [[switch hitter|switch hitting]] [[catcher]] [[Todd Hundley]] breaking the Major League Baseball single season record for home runs hit by catcher with 41. [[Center fielder]] [[Lance Johnson]] set single-season franchise records in [[Hit (baseball)|hits]] (227), [[Triple (baseball)|triples]] (21), [[at bat]]s (682), [[Run (baseball)|runs scored]] (117). Johnson's 21 triples also led the National League, the highest amount by an NL player since 1930.\n\n====1997====\n{{Main|1997 New York Mets season}}\n\nIn the off season, the Mets acquired first baseman [[John Olerud]] from the Toronto Blue Jays for pitcher [[Robert Person]].\n\nIn 1997, the Mets finally bounced back with an 88-74 record, missing the playoffs by only four games, and the team improved by 17 wins from 1996. On June 16, the Mets beat the [[1997 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] in the first ever regular-season game played between the crosstown rivals 6\u20130.<ref name=FirstCrossTownGame>{{cite news|title=The First Brag Belongs to Mlicki and the Mets|date=June 17, 1997|first=Murray|last=Chass|newspaper=New York Times|page=B9|authorlink=Murray Chass}}</ref> Mets starter [[Dave Mlicki]] pitched a complete game shutout to pick up the win.<ref name=FirstCrossTownGame/> In 1997, Hundley's great season was derailed by a devastating elbow injury and required [[Tommy John surgery]].\n\nAlso, during the season, on April 15, the Mets hosted ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of [[Jackie Robinson]]'s first game with the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] before their game against the Los Angeles Dodgers at [[Shea Stadium]].<ref name=Robinson>{{cite news|title=A Grand Tribute to Robinson and His Moment|date=April 16, 1997|first=Claire|last=Smith|newspaper=New York Times|page=A1}}</ref> During the ceremonies, Robinson's jersey number, 42, was retired by Major League Baseball.<ref name=Robinson/> The Mets won the game 5-0.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mets' Own Melting Pot Provides Victory Blend|date=April 16, 1997|first=Buster|last=Olney|newspaper=New York Times|page=B14|authorlink=Buster Olney}}</ref>\n\n===1998\u20132002: Piazza, the Subway World Series and 9/11===\n[[File:Mike Piazza (1999).jpg|thumb|200px|left|Mike Piazza on May 30, 1999]]\n\n====1998====\n{{Main|1998 New York Mets season}}\nThe Mets season in 1998 began with an unforgettable opening day game at [[Shea Stadium]] on March 31 against their [[Mets\u2013Phillies rivalry|division rival]] [[Philadelphia Phillies]], marking the first time that a regular season baseball game was played in New York in March.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mets Take An Opener For the Ages|date=April 1, 1998|first=George|last=Vecsey|newspaper=New York Times|page=C1|authorlink=George Vecsey}}</ref> Both of them were involved in the longest scoreless opening day game in the National League and the longest one in the MLB since 1926 when the [[Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|Washington Senators]] beat the [[Philadelphia Athletics]] 1-0 in 15 innings.<ref>{{cite news|title=For Openers, Zilch Phils Fall in 14th Without a Run|date=April 1, 1998|first=Jim|last=Salisbury|newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer|page=E1}}</ref><ref name=1998OpeningDay>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04E5D71E3BF932A35757C0A96E958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=print|title=A Midsummer Classic in March as Mets Nip Phillies|date=April 1, 1998|first=Jason|last=Diamos|newspaper=New York Times|page=C1}}</ref> The Mets won the game 1-0 in 14 innings when backup catcher [[Alberto Castillo (catcher)|Alberto Castillo]] delivered a full-count, two-out, pinch-hit single to right with the bases loaded off Philadelphia closer [[Ricky Bottalico]].<ref name=1998OpeningDay/>\n\nDuring the season, the Mets acquired [[Mike Piazza]] in a blockbuster trade that immediately brought star power and credibility to the Mets that had been lacking in recent years.\n\nAfter the Piazza trade, the Mets played well, but missed the 1998 postseason by only one game.

The Mets, in front of a national audience on [[ESPN Sunday Night Baseball|''Sunday Night Baseball'']], beat the [[1999 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] 7\u20132 in the turning point of the 1999 season. Both Mike Piazza and Robin Ventura had MVP-type seasons and [[Benny Agbayani]] emerged as an important role player. It was a breakout year for Mets second baseman [[Edgardo Alfonzo]] and [[Roger Cede\u00f1o]], who broke the single season steals record for the Mets.\n\nAfter the regular season ended, the Mets played [[1999 National League Wild-Card tie-breaker game|a one-game playoff]] against the [[1999 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]], [[Al Leiter]] pitched the best game of his Met career as he hurled a two-hit complete-game shutout to advance the Mets to the playoffs. In the [[1999 National League Division Series|NLDS]], the Mets defeated the [[1999 Arizona Diamondbacks season|Arizona Diamondbacks]] 3 games to 1. The series-clinching victory included a walk-off home run by backup catcher [[Todd Pratt]]. The Mets would lose however in the [[1999 National League Championship Series]] to the [[1999 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]], in six exciting games which included the famous [[Grand Slam Single]] by Robin Ventura to win game 5 for the Mets.<ref name=SubwaySeries/> The Mets were at one point down 3\u20130 in the series.\n\n====2000: The \"Subway World Series\"====\n{{Main|2000 New York Mets season}}\nIn the 1999 offseason, the Mets traded Roger Cede\u00f1o and [[Octavio Dotel]] to the [[Houston Astros]] for [[Derek Bell (baseball)|Derek Bell]] and [[Mike Hampton]]. [[Todd Zeile]] was signed to play first base, replacing departing free agent John Olerud.\n\nThe 2000 season began well for the Mets as Derek Bell became the best hitter on the team for the first month. The highlight of the season came on June 30 when the Mets beat the rival [[2000 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]] in a memorable game at Shea Stadium on ''Fireworks Night''. With the Mets losing 8\u20131 to begin the bottom of the eighth, they rallied back with two outs to tie the game, capping the 10-run inning with Mike Piazza's three run home run to put the Mets up 11\u20138, giving them the lead and eventually the win. The Mets easily made the playoffs winning the [[National League]] wild card. In the playoffs, the Mets beat the [[2000 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] in the first round and the [[2000 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] in the [[2000 National League Championship Series]] to win their fourth NL pennant. Mike Hampton was named the NLCS MVP for his two scoreless starts in the series as the Mets headed to the [[2000 World Series]] to face their crosstown rivals, the New York Yankees. The Mets were defeated in the much-hyped \"[[Subway Series]].\" This marked the first all-New York World Series since [[1956 World Series|1956]], when the [[1956 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] defeated the [[1956 Brooklyn Dodgers season|Brooklyn Dodgers]]. With the Cardinals sweeping the Braves in their NLDS series, it made the Mets' run to the World Series much easier, given that the Braves eliminated the Mets from the playoffs and/or playoff contention in 1998 and 1999.<ref name=SubwaySeries>{{cite book|title=The subway series: the Yankees, the Mets and a season to remember|year=2000|publisher=The Sporting News|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=0-89204-659-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=From Wild Card to World Series|date=October 17, 2000|first=Murray|last=Chass|newspaper=New York Times|authorlink=Murray Chass}}</ref>\n\nThe most memorable moment of the 2000 World Series occurred during the first inning of Game 2 at Yankee Stadium. Piazza fouled off a pitch which shattered his bat, sending a piece of the barrel toward the pitcher's mound. Pitcher [[Roger Clemens]] seized the piece and hurled it in the direction of Piazza as the catcher trotted to first base, benches briefly cleared before the game was resumed with no ejections. In July 2000, Clemens had knocked Piazza unconscious with a fastball to the helmet, Piazza had previously enjoyed great success against Clemens, with 3 crucial home runs in previous encounters.\n\n====2001: September 11 attacks====\n{{Main|2001 New York Mets season}}\nIn 2001, the Mets finished with a record of 82\u201380. After the [[September 11 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]] [[Shea Stadium]] was used as a relief center and then saw the first sporting event in New York City since the attacks, in a game vs. the [[2001 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]] on September 21. Before the game the [[New York City Fire Department|FDNY]], [[New York City Fire Department#Bureau of EMS|EMT]], [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]], and all rescue workers were honored, [[Diana Ross]] sang \"[[God Bless America]]\", the two teams shook hands to show that they were united in the face of tragedy, and Liza Minnelli sang \"[[Theme from New York, New York|New York, New York]]\" during the 7th inning stretch. In the bottom of the 8th inning the Mets were trailing 2\u20131 when Mike Piazza came to bat with a runner on first. Piazza dramatically sent Shea into a frenzy by crushing a home run to give the Mets a 3\u20132 lead and the eventual win. The game is considered to be one of the greatest moments in the history of the franchise. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Mets, as well as other teams in the league, wore [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]], FDNY, NYPD and [[PAPD]] baseball caps. Unlike the other teams, the Mets wore these for the rest of the year, despite threats of fines by Major League Baseball.\n\n====2002 season====\n{{Main|2002 New York Mets season}}\n\nIn the following seasons, the Mets struggled mightily as the result of several poor player acquisitions, including [[Mo Vaughn]], [[Roberto Alomar]], and re-acquiring former Mets Roger Cede\u00f1o and [[Jeromy Burnitz]]. These acquisitions were made by then-general manager [[Steve Phillips]], who was fired during the 2003 season. Phillips was credited with building the 2000 World Series team, but also blamed for the demise of the Mets' farm system and the poor play of the acquired players. His final year as a Met was the 2002 season after playing 8 seasons with the club [[Edgardo Alfonzo]] left New York after signing as a free agent that off-season with the [[San Francisco Giants]]. The Mets did have a few bright spots in 2002. Al Leiter became the first major league pitcher to defeat all thirty major league teams with a victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. However, the Mets posted a 75\u201386 record, last in the [[National League East|NL East]].\n\nThe team's 2002 difficulties reached off the field as co-owners Wilpon and Doubleday became embroiled in a bitter legal dispute over Wilpon's attempt to buy Doubleday's half of the team. Doubleday alleged that Major League Baseball attached an unrealistically low value to the team, thereby lowering the amount of money he would receive from Wilpon in the buyout. Wilpon sued Doubleday in federal court to force the sale. The purchase was finally settled and Wilpon became sole owner of the Mets on August 23, 2002.<ref name=\"NYTWilpon\">{{cite news|title=Sale to Wilpon Is Final|work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 24, 2002|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01E4D6123CF937A1575BC0A9649C8B63|accessdate=July 27, 2008}}</ref>  Wilpon, the founder of [[Sterling Equities]], Inc., manages the Mets through his [[limited partnership]] firm, Sterling Mets.<ref name=\"HooverSterlingMets\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hoovers.com/sterling-mets-lp/--ID__46720--/free-co-profile.xhtml|title=Sterling Mets LP \u2013 Company Description|publisher=[[Hoover's]]|accessdate=July 27, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===2003\u20132010: Minaya, Randolph, Reyes/Wright, collapses and Citi Field===\nIn a span of about a calendar year the Mets called up top prospects shortstop [[Jos\u00e9 Reyes (infielder)|Jos\u00e9 Reyes]] and third baseman [[David Wright]]. Since then Reyes and Wright have become the most accomplished products from the Mets' farm system since [[Darryl Strawberry]] and [[Dwight Gooden]].\n\n====2003 season====\n{{Main|2003 New York Mets season}}\n\nThe Mets' record in 2003 (66\u201395) was the fourth worst in baseball, and Piazza had missed two-thirds of the season with a torn groin muscle. His steady decline around that time mirrored the Mets' fortunes for the first half of the decade. Also Jos\u00e9 Reyes <nowiki/>made his debut on June 10, 2003 and his first career homerun happened to be a grand slam against the [[Los Angeles Angels|Anaheim Angels]] that season.\n\n====2004 season====\n{{Main|2004 New York Mets season}}\n\nIn 2004, the Mets made more poor player acquisitions including signing Japanese shortstop [[Kazuo Matsui]], who never lived up to his potential in two-and-a-half years with the Mets. General manager [[Jim Duquette]] acquired pitcher [[Kris Benson]] for third baseman [[Ty Wigginton]] at the trade deadline just before one of the worst trades in franchise history, sending highly touted pitching prospect [[Scott Kazmir]] to the [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] for the disappointing [[V\u00edctor Zambrano]]. On July 21, 2004, playing against the [[Montreal Expos]] the Mets brought up future team captain David Wright but still finished with a 71\u201391 record in 2004.\n\n{{wikinews|Frank Messina: An interview with the 'Mets Poet'}}\nAfter the 2004 season, [[2004 New York Mets season|Mets]] ownership made significant changes to their management strategy. With their television contract with the [[Cablevision]] expiring at the end of 2005, they announced plans to establish their own cable network to broadcast Mets games. This investment in what became known as [[SportsNet New York]] was coupled with an aggressive plan to upgrade the performance of the team on the field. [[Jim Duquette]] was replaced as general manager by former Expos GM [[Omar Minaya]]. Minaya, an ex-Mets assistant GM, had achieved notable success in Montreal by making bold player moves on a limited budget. With the Mets, Minaya was given substantial financial resources to develop a winning team.\n\n====2005 season====\n{{Main|2005 New York Mets season}}\n\nMinaya began by hiring Yankee bench coach [[Willie Randolph]] as manager, then signed two of that year's most sought-after free agents&nbsp;\u2014 [[Pedro Mart\u00ednez]] and [[Carlos Beltr\u00e1n]]&nbsp;\u2014 to large multi-year deals.  Despite an 0\u20135 start to the [[2005 Major League Baseball season|season]], the team finished 83\u201379, finishing above the .500 mark for the first time since 2001. The 2005 season was also the last by [[Mike Piazza]] in a Mets uniform.\n\nDuring the 2005 offseason star first baseman [[Carlos Delgado]] and catcher [[Paul Lo Duca]] were acquired via trade and the Mets signed free agent closer [[Billy Wagner]].\n\n====2006 season====\n{{Main|2006 New York Mets season}}\n\nIn 2006, led by a franchise record six [[2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Stars]] (Beltran, Lo Duca, Reyes, Wright, [[Tom Glavine]], and Mart\u00ednez), the Mets won the division title, their first in 18 years. In a runaway similar to 1986, the Mets led the division from April 6 on, and only spent one day out of first the whole season. The Mets finished the season 12 games ahead of the [[2006 Philadelphia Phillies season|Phillies]], and with the best record in the [[National League]].  The turning point for the season was a June 9\u20131 road trip.  The 2006 season was also the first time that the Mets and [[2006 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] each won their respective divisions in the same year and both teams tied for the best record in baseball.\n\nThe Mets swept the [[2006 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] in the [[2006 National League Division Series]]. In the [[2006 National League Championship Series]], the Mets lost in seven games to the [[2006 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]], the eventual [[2006 World Series]] champions. Game 7 featured one of the most spectacular plays in postseason history when left fielder [[Endy Ch\u00e1vez]] leaped over the 8-foot (2.4 m)-high left field wall in the top of the sixth inning and caught the ball with the tip of his glove to rob Cardinals third baseman [[Scott Rolen]] of a two-run home run. Ch\u00e1vez then threw to the cutoff man second baseman [[Jos\u00e9 Valent\u00edn]], who threw to Carlos Delgado at first base, doubling off center fielder [[Jim Edmonds]] for an inning-ending double play. Ch\u00e1vez's effort was in vain, however, as [[Yadier Molina]]'s two-run home run in the ninth off of [[Aaron Heilman]] gave the Cardinals a 3-1 lead and Carlos Beltr\u00e1n took a curve ball from Cardinals closer [[Adam Wainwright]] for a called third strike with the bases loaded on a full count in the bottom of the 9th inning to end the Mets season.\n\n====2007 season====\n{{Main|2007 New York Mets season}}\n\nAfter their success in 2006, there were high expectations for the Mets in 2007, and they started the season strong. The Mets then had a 7-game lead in the division with 17 games to go. The Mets, however, would lose 12 of their final 17 games enabling the [[2007 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] to win the NL East by one game. The Mets were eliminated on the final day of the season as Tom Glavine allowed 7 runs to the [[2007 Florida Marlins season|Florida Marlins]] and only got through 1/3 of an inning in his final start as a Met.  The Mets became the first team in baseball history to blow a lead of seven or more games with only 17 games to play.<ref name=\"collapse\">{{cite news\n|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2007-09-30-nl-season-end-cover_N.htm\n|last=Ortiz\n|first=Jorge L.\n|title= Mets' historic fall highlights a crazy Sunday in the NL\n|agency=Associated Press\n|accessdate=March 5, 2008\n|date=October 1, 2007}}</ref>\n\n====2008 season====\n{{Main|2008 New York Mets season}}\nIn the 2007 offseason the team acquired two-time [[Cy Young Award]]-winning pitcher [[Johan Santana]] from the [[Minnesota Twins]] for outfielder [[Carlos G\u00f3mez]] and minor-league pitchers [[Philip Humber]], [[Deolis Guerra]] and [[Kevin Mulvey]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Twins agree to deal Santana to Mets for 4 prospects |first=Bob |last=Nightengale |work=[[USA Today]] |date=January 30, 2008 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2008-01-29-twins-mets-santana_N.htm?loc=interstitialskip# }}</ref>\n\nThe 2008 season marked the final season at [[Shea Stadium]], the team's home for 45 years.

In September the Mets had 3.5 game divisional lead over the [[2008 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] with 17 games left to play. However, the Mets lost 10 of their final 17 games. The Phillies went 13\u20134 during the same stretch and won the division (the Phillies went on to win the World Series). The Mets still remained in the NL Wild Card with the [[2008 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]] but on September 28, the final game played at Shea Stadium, the Mets were eliminated from playoff contention by losing to the [[2008 Florida Marlins season|Florida Marlins]] on the season's final day for the second straight season.\n\n====2009 season: Citi Field opens and the season of injuries====\n{{Main|2009 New York Mets season}}\n[[File:Citi Field Day.jpg|thumb|left|[[Citi Field]], home of the Mets beginning in 2009.]]\nTo improve the bullpen for the 2009 season, which was arguably the reason the Mets missed the playoffs in 2007 and 2008, the Mets signed free agent closer [[Francisco Rodr\u00edguez (Venezuelan pitcher)|Francisco Rodr\u00edguez]], who established a single-season major league record for saves (62) as a member of the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]] in 2008.  They also acquired setup man [[J. J. Putz]] from the [[Seattle Mariners]] in exchange for several players.\n\nThe 2009 season was the Mets' first season at [[Citi Field]], a retropark following current architectural trends in stadium design. It follows the brick and steel-truss trend begun by the Orioles at [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]] in 1992. The exterior facade resembles [[Ebbets Field]], former home of the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]]. The Mets' first exhibition game at Citi Field was played on April 3, 2009 against the [[2009 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]]. The first regular season home game was on April 13, 2009 against the [[2009 San Diego Padres season|San Diego Padres]], who spoiled the opener with a 6\u20135 win against the Mets. In that game, [[Jody Gerut]] of the Padres became the first player to open a new ballpark with a leadoff home run. On April 17, [[Gary Sheffield]], who just days earlier was signed by the Mets as a free agent, hit his [[500 home run club|500th home run]] against the [[2009 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]]. Sheffield became the first pinch hitter to reach this milestone, as well as the first to do it in a Mets uniform.\n\nThe 2009 season for the Mets was marred by numerous injuries suffered by its players, with 20 of them having been on the [[disabled list]] at one point or another during the season and losing star (and also replacement) players like [[J. J. Putz]], [[John Maine]], [[\u00d3liver P\u00e9rez]], [[Jos\u00e9 Reyes (shortstop)|Jos\u00e9 Reyes]], [[Carlos Beltr\u00e1n]], [[David Wright]], [[Carlos Delgado]], [[Johan Santana]], and [[Gary Sheffield]].
