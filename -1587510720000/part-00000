It was originally raised as the '''14th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment'''.\n\n==History==\n===14th Mass Infantry===\nThe 14th Massachusetts Infantry began its recruitment in spring 1861, with most of its members coming from [[Essex County, Massachusetts|Essex County]]. They were mustered in on 5 July 1861, and left the state on 7 August for [[Washington, DC]], where it would serve in its defenses until the end of the year. Colonel William B Greene, a [[West Point]] graduate and a veteran of the [[Seminole Wars|Florida Indian Wars]], resigned in October, and was replaced as leader of the unit by Col Thomas R Tannatt, who transferred over from the [[16th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry]].\n\n===Reorganization as artillery===\nOn 1 January 1862, the regiment was reorganized and became a [[heavy artillery]] regiment. As artillery units required more men, fifty additional soldiers were added to each company and two additional ones were formed. They served in several military garrisons around Washington, including forts [[Fort Woodbury|Woodbury]], [[Fort Tillinghast|Tillinghast]], [[Fort Craig (Virginia)|Craig]], [[Fort Albany (Arlington, Virginia)|Albany]], and DeKalb.\n\n===Early skirmishes===\nOn 26 August 1862, the regiment was sent to the front, and was present at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], though it did not participate. During the Union retreat from the battlefield, Confederate cavalry overtook the 1st Massachusetts, capturing the surgical staff, the wagoners, and others. The doctors were quickly released, while the others were later paroled.<ref>Mass. in the War, pg 723</ref>  \n\nA battalion of two companies were detached (two more joined a month or two later) on 27 September 1862 and sent to Maryland Heights, where they were to serve until December 1863. When the [[Union army]] abandoned its position at [[Winchester, VA]] in June 1863, Company I stayed behind to destroy the guns and ammunition, and 44 men were captured on 10 June. At this time, Company H was covering the army's retreat from [[Harpers Ferry]].<ref name=\"Higginson, pg 170\">Higginson, pg 170</ref>\n\n===First engagement===\nOn 17 May 1864, many heavy artillery regiments filled in as infantry units and joined the [[Army of the Potomac]] as part of [[Valley Campaigns of 1864|Grant's 1864 campaign]]. In their first real engagement as a regiment, they engaged Ewell's Division at [[Harris Farm Engagement]], on the Fredericksburg Road near [[Spotsylvania Courthouse, Virginia|Spotsylvania, VA]] on 19 May 1864. In this battle, they lost 55 killed, 312 wounded, and 27 missing.<ref>Mass in the War, pg 726</ref> In reserve during the [[Battle of North Anna]] on 23\u201326 May 1864, losing only 1 killed, they moved on to [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]], losing two members during the trench warfare there from 4\u201312 June.\n\n===Siege of Petersburg===\nThe regiment took part in the assault on [[Siege of Petersburg|Petersburg]] on the 16 June 1864, and lost 25 killed and 132 wounded. They remained as part of the siege of the city until April 1865. During this time, they were also involved in the [[Battle of Globe Tavern]] (or the 2nd Battle of Weldon Railroad), when 185 men were captured when a Confederate offensive flanked the division, and the [[Battle of Hatcher's Run]].\n\n===Lee's surrender===\nFollowing Lee's surrender in April 1865, the 1st Massachusetts Heavy Artillery returned to Washington, DC and stationed the forts until they were mustered out in August.

Symptoms include a sudden loss of central vision, but patients eventually regain normal vision. The white dots are small and located in the posterior pole at the level of the [[retinal pigment epithelium]] (RPE). The white dots may disappear after the first few weeks of the disease. The cause is generally unknown, but a viral illness has been reported prior to MEWDS in one-third of cases.<ref name =\"orange\" /> Since the disease occurs primarily in females, \u201chormonal status\u201d might be a contributing factor.<ref name =\"red\" /><ref name =\"book\" /><ref name=\"ken\">Chern KC ZM.

However, AZOOR may definitely be related to other diseases included in the white dot syndrome group. AZOOR occurs in young to middle age adults and may eventually progress to retinal cell death.  Symptoms include acute visual field loss and photopsias.

The fundus presents with yellow or gray lesions (white dots) at the level of the choroid and RPE. The size of the white dots are between 50 and 500 micrometres and localized in the macula. MPC is characterized by vitritis and anterior chamber inflammation. Decreased vision due to vitreous inflammation may occur. Unlike MEWDS, MPC is a chronic disorder and [[macular scarring]] contributes to severe visual loss. Theories regarding the cause include an exogenous pathogen sensitizing an individual to antigens within photoreceptors, RPE, or choroid.<ref name =\"orange\" /><ref name=\"green\">Polk TD, Goldman EJ. Chorioretinal Inflammatory Syndromes. International Ophthalmology Clinics. 1999;39(4):33-53.</ref>\n\n===Punctate inner choroiditis===\n{{main|Punctate inner choroiditis}}\nPunctate inner choroiditis (PIC) is an inflammatory choroiditis which occurs mainly in young females. Symptoms include blurred vision and scotomas. . Gray-white or yellow lesions are mainly present in the posterior pole and are between 100 and 300 micrometres in size. PIC is one of the so-called White dot syndromes which come under the heading posterior uveitis.The appearance of punctate (punched out) areas is at the level of the inner choroid. These lesions are typically located centrally at the back of the eye (posterior pole).\n\n===Serpiginous choroiditis===\n{{main|Serpiginous choroiditis}}\nSerpiginous choroiditis, also known as geographic or helicoid choroidopathy, is an uncommon chronic progressive inflammatory condition affecting adult men and women equally in the second to seventh decades of life.\n\n== Nature of white dots ==\nThe white dots of the white dot syndromes are lesions that vary in their location in the fundus and in most cases tend to disappear. White dots appear early in the disease stages of PIC and MEWDS. In this case, the white dot is localized in the [[posterior pole]], small (between 25 and 100 \u03bcm), and do not clump together.<ref name=\"violet\">Ben Ezra D, Forrester JV. Fundal white dots: the spectrum of a similar pathological process. Br J Ophthalmol. 1995;79(9):856-60.</ref> In contrast, white dots appear later in the disease stages of birdshot choroidopathy, serpiginous choroiditis, and APMPPE. The white dots in these diseases may be present throughout the entire fundus, larger (50 to 500 \u03bcm), and tend to clump together. Among all these syndromes, there exists some retinal vessel inflammation. The differences in the dots are usually in the size, position, and depth of the lesion within the [[choroid]].<ref name =\"violet\" />\n\nThe way in which the dots form in some of the white dot syndromes has been reported. The dot appears as a small [[granuloma]] which is composed of [[lymphocytes]] and [[macrophages]]. The lesion may occur within the choroid, between Bruch\u2019s membrane and RPE, or between the RPE and photoreceptors.<ref name =\"violet\" />  Despite the differences in location, the white dots all are of similar composition. The center of the lesion consists of macrophages and epithelioid cells. CD4+ T cells are on the periphery of the granuloma. Benezra has theorized that a large amount of CD8+ T suppressor cells are observed in the later stages of the disease in order to down regulate the inflammatory immune reaction.<ref name=\"teal\">Benezra D. Ocular inflammation: basic and clinical concepts. 1999: 512.</ref>\n\nThe formation of a granuloma occurs when activated antigen presenting cells, specifically dendritic cells, \u201cbind to T cells and induce\u2026the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.\u201d This response attracts additional antigen presenting cells and will eventually become a granuloma. Choroidal dendritic cells span several levels within the choroid and also associate with the RPE.  Usually, the dendritic cells disappear after removing the antigen. If removal did not occur, the formation of a granuloma would result. The white color of the dots when illuminated may be due to the granulomas composed only of \u201cwhite cells\u201d.  Each granuloma will disappear leaving no trace of its presence but in some cases it may leave a \u2018punched out\u2019 scar.  It is important to note that the formation of white dots may occur more frequently but is undetected. In normal cases, inflammation of the retina or choroid does not occur.  Muller and RPE cells normally release immunosuppressive factors, but certain combinations of cytokines may stimulate RPE cells to release factors encouraging inflammation.<ref name=\"violet\" />\n\nGenerally, mild intraocular inflammation results in a small, discrete, evanescent lesions. Larger dots, having less discrete borders, are the result of high intensity intraocular inflammation.<ref name = \"teal\" /> In essence, an immune response with the normal amount and appropriate cytokine release will result in small white dots and a misregulated response eventually will produce scarring of the retinal tissue. Treatment is required in the latter case to combat loss of vision.<ref name = \"violet\" /> The white dots usually disappear naturally. Corticosteroids have been shown to speed up this process.  The differences in the immune response of each patient may contribute to the differences seen between the white dot syndromes.<ref name = \"teal\" />\n\n===Distinct diseases===\nDue to the number of common features among the multiple syndromes, many suggest that the white dot syndromes are not distinct and represent a spectrum of one disease.<ref name =\"red\" /> Gass described the \u2018AZOOR complex\u2019 which consists of MEWDS, MPC, PIC, acute idiopathic blind spot enlargement, acute macular neuroretinopathy, acute annular outer retinopathy, and AZOOR. He suggested these diseases represent one disease due to common factors such as a high occurrence in females, unexplained visual field loss, and reduced electroretinographic amplitudes.<ref name =\"orange\" /><ref name=\"pink\">Jampol LM, Becker KG. White spot syndromes of the retina: a hypothesis based on the common genetic hypothesis of autoimmune/inflammatory disease. American Journal of Ophthalmology. 2003;135(3):376-9.</ref> Reddy et al. conducted a study on the blind spots in MPC, PIC, MEWDS, and diffuse subretinal fibrosis syndrome. Clinical and electroretinographic evidence suggested the diseases are distinct.<ref name=\"Reddy\">Reddy CV, Brown J, Folk JC, Kimura AE, Gupta S, Walker J. Enlarged blind spots in chorioretinal inflammatory disorders. Ophthalmology. 1996; 103(4): 606-617.</ref> However, numerous differences do occur in fundus appearance, the clinical course of the diseases, and electrophysiology.<ref name=\"green\" />\n\n===Suspected etiology===\nOne cause of the White Dot Syndromes as suggested by Gass involves viral or infectious agents.  Specifically pertaining to the \u2018AZOOR complex,\u2019 Gass has postulated that a virus may enter the retina at the optic head and the infection may spread from one photoreceptor to another.<ref name =\"pink\" /> Some unexplained features include the development of more than one disease in the same patient and the majority of cases occurring in females.\n\nAccording to Becker\u2019s common genetic hypothesis, \u201cunlike mendelian genetic disorders, common autoimmune and inflammatory diseases arise from combinatorial interactions of common non-disease specific loci, disease specific loci, and specific environmental triggers.\u201d<ref name=\"becker\">Becker, K. G. (2001). The common genetic hypothesis of autoimmune/inflammatory disease. Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol, 1(5), 399-405.</ref> An important aspect of this hypothesis pertains to the existence of common non-disease genes that predispose patients to autoimmune diseases.  Jampol and Becker insinuate that \u2018common susceptibility genes\u2019 are present in patients affected by white dot syndromes. The presence of environmental triggers, such as viral infections, immunizations, and stress, and interactions with other genes contribute to the development of the white dot syndromes. Additionally, Jampol and Becker hypothesize that the predisposing genetic loci can be identified.<ref name = \"pink\" />\n\nGass points to a lack of evidence in support of the Becker theory. Instead, Gass highlights that although evidence indicates that patients with AZOOR have a greater chance of developing autoimmune diseases, this does not mean that the AZOOR complex of disorders are themselves autoimmune diseases. This is supported by the difficulty in detecting \u201cretinal autoantibodies\u201d in AZOOR patients.<ref name=\"Gass\">Gass, J. D. (2003). Are acute zonal occult outer retinopathy and the white spot syndromes (AZOOR complex) specific autoimmune diseases? American Journal of Ophthalmology, 135(3), 380-381.</ref>\n\nTwo other diseases which also present with white dots on the fundus are retinitis punctata albescens and fundus albipunctatus. These diseases are not white dot syndromes, but have much more defined etiology. Retinitis punctata albescens is caused by mutations in [[RLBP1]], the gene for retinaldehyde binding protein 1. In comparison, fundus albipunctatus is caused by mutations in RDH5 gene for an 11-cis-RDH in RPE cells.<ref name=\"punctata\">Travis GH, Golczak M, Moise AR, Palczewski K.

Specifically pertaining to the \u2018AZOOR complex,\u2019 Gass has postulated that a virus may enter the retina at the optic head and the infection may spread from one photoreceptor to another.<ref name =\"pink\" /> Some unexplained features include the development of more than one disease in the same patient and the majority of cases occurring in females.\n\nAccording to Becker\u2019s common genetic hypothesis, \u201cunlike mendelian genetic disorders, common autoimmune and inflammatory diseases arise from combinatorial interactions of common non-disease specific loci, disease specific loci, and specific environmental triggers.\u201d<ref name=\"becker\">Becker, K. G. (2001). The common genetic hypothesis of autoimmune/inflammatory disease. Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol, 1(5), 399-405.</ref> An important aspect of this hypothesis pertains to the existence of common non-disease genes that predispose patients to autoimmune diseases.  Jampol and Becker insinuate that \u2018common susceptibility genes\u2019 are present in patients affected by white dot syndromes. The presence of environmental triggers, such as viral infections, immunizations, and stress, and interactions with other genes contribute to the development of the white dot syndromes. Additionally, Jampol and Becker hypothesize that the predisposing genetic loci can be identified.<ref name = \"pink\" />\n\nGass points to a lack of evidence in support of the Becker theory. Instead, Gass highlights that although evidence indicates that patients with AZOOR have a greater chance of developing autoimmune diseases, this does not mean that the AZOOR complex of disorders are themselves autoimmune diseases. This is supported by the difficulty in detecting \u201cretinal autoantibodies\u201d in AZOOR patients.<ref name=\"Gass\">Gass, J. D. (2003). Are acute zonal occult outer retinopathy and the white spot syndromes (AZOOR complex) specific autoimmune diseases? American Journal of Ophthalmology, 135(3), 380-381.</ref>\n\nTwo other diseases which also present with white dots on the fundus are retinitis punctata albescens and fundus albipunctatus. These diseases are not white dot syndromes, but have much more defined etiology. Retinitis punctata albescens is caused by mutations in [[RLBP1]], the gene for retinaldehyde binding protein 1. In comparison, fundus albipunctatus is caused by mutations in RDH5 gene for an 11-cis-RDH in RPE cells.<ref name=\"punctata\">Travis GH, Golczak M, Moise AR, Palczewski K.

Marsden DeLapp, PE |accessdate=2009-10-20}}</ref> [[Autodesk]] had recently entered into direct competition with Cyco Software (another third-party Autodesk partner), and Softdesk was concerned that the same could happen to them. The AutoCAD-clone project was kept semi-secret under the project name ''\"Phoenix\".''\n\nIn December 1996 Autodesk announced that it would instead buy Softdesk outright for $90 million in common stock. A complaint regarding the inclusive sale of IntelliCADD was filed with the US [[Federal Trade Commission]] (\"FTC\"). According to [http://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/9710049/autodesk-inc-softdesk-inc FTC Docket No. C-3756]:\n\n:''In approximately June 1996, Softdesk determined that it no longer had the financial ability to support continued development and marketing of the IntelliCADD product. The head of the team that had developed the product proposed to purchase the technology and formed Boomerang Technology, Inc. (\"Boomerang\") for the purpose of acquiring the product, completing its development, and bringing the product to market. Boomerang negotiated with Softdesk for the purchase of the IntelliCADD product and exchanged draft purchase agreements with Softdesk. Softdesk, however, terminated those negotiations at around the time that Autodesk agreed to acquire Softdesk. Softdesk representatives previously told Boomerang that Softdesk would sell the IntelliCADD product to Boomerang if Softdesk were purchased by someone other than Autodesk, but would not sell it to Boomerang if Softdesk were purchased by Autodesk...''\n\n:''After being advised by Commission staff that Autodesk's acquisition of Softdesk raised competitive concerns in the market for personal computer-based CAD engines, Softdesk resumed negotiations with Boomerang and divested and sold all of its rights in the IntelliCADD product to Boomerang pursuant to a Technology Transfer Agreement dated February 21, 1997. On that same date, Boomerang assigned and sold all of its rights to the IntelliCADD product to Visio Corporation.''\n\nBy late 1996 a formal search for new venture capital was underway. Marketing director Robert Drummer was referred to John Forbes at [[Visio Corporation]]<ref name=\"AECNEWS (Archived)\">{{cite web|url=http://aecnews.blogspot.com/2007/07/visio-acquires-assets-of-boomerang.html|title=Visio Acquires Assets Of Boomerang Technology|year=1997|last=Newton|first=Randall|accessdate=2009-12-24}}</ref> and \"gave him the pitch\".

Marsden DeLapp, PE |accessdate=2009-10-20}}</ref> [[Autodesk]] had recently entered into direct competition with Cyco Software (another third-party Autodesk partner), and Softdesk was concerned that the same could happen to them. The AutoCAD-clone project was kept semi-secret under the project name ''\"Phoenix\".''\n\nIn December 1996 Autodesk announced that it would instead buy Softdesk outright for $90 million in common stock. A complaint regarding the inclusive sale of IntelliCADD was filed with the US [[Federal Trade Commission]] (\"FTC\"). According to [http://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/9710049/autodesk-inc-softdesk-inc FTC Docket No. C-3756]:\n\n:''In approximately June 1996, Softdesk determined that it no longer had the financial ability to support continued development and marketing of the IntelliCADD product. The head of the team that had developed the product proposed to purchase the technology and formed Boomerang Technology, Inc. (\"Boomerang\") for the purpose of acquiring the product, completing its development, and bringing the product to market. Boomerang negotiated with Softdesk for the purchase of the IntelliCADD product and exchanged draft purchase agreements with Softdesk. Softdesk, however, terminated those negotiations at around the time that Autodesk agreed to acquire Softdesk. Softdesk representatives previously told Boomerang that Softdesk would sell the IntelliCADD product to Boomerang if Softdesk were purchased by someone other than Autodesk, but would not sell it to Boomerang if Softdesk were purchased by Autodesk...''\n\n:''After being advised by Commission staff that Autodesk's acquisition of Softdesk raised competitive concerns in the market for personal computer-based CAD engines, Softdesk resumed negotiations with Boomerang and divested and sold all of its rights in the IntelliCADD product to Boomerang pursuant to a Technology Transfer Agreement dated February 21, 1997. On that same date, Boomerang assigned and sold all of its rights to the IntelliCADD product to Visio Corporation.''\n\nBy late 1996 a formal search for new venture capital was underway. Marketing director Robert Drummer was referred to John Forbes at [[Visio Corporation]]<ref name=\"AECNEWS (Archived)\">{{cite web|url=http://aecnews.blogspot.com/2007/07/visio-acquires-assets-of-boomerang.html|title=Visio Acquires Assets Of Boomerang Technology|year=1997|last=Newton|first=Randall|accessdate=2009-12-24}}</ref> and \"gave him the pitch\".

They arrived in San Diego that evening.\" A core team of nine Softdesk/IntelliCADD developers soon moved to become employees of Visio.
