most of Amos's albums, is also known for its collection of original b-sides. Amos recorded a host of songs that did not make the album, but were released as b-sides to various singles or performed live in concerts. The songs \"Cooling,\" \"Never Seen Blue,\" and \"Beulah Land\" were originally written and recorded for 1996's ''[[Boys for Pele]]'' album. In 2010, several tracks from a demo CD for the album leaked online, including a new track entitled \"Violet's Eyes\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LVkxX1Euq0 |title=Tori Amos \u2013 Violet's Eyes (demo) |via=YouTube |date=July 8, 2010 |accessdate=17 February 2012}}</ref> Parts of this song were included in two tracks on 2007's [[American Doll Posse]], \"Almost Rosey\" and \"Miracle\".\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

An industry insider believed the idea would not work and would be pulled by Christmas 1988, but despite ''This Morning'' being launched with no publicity, its ratings quickly rose to a daily average of two million viewers.\n\nIn the first few series', the show's \"experts\" were weatherman [[Fred Talbot]], [[Advice column |agony aunt]] [[Denise Robertson]], medic [[Chris Steele (doctor)|Dr Chris Steele]], cook Susan Brookes, beauty presenter [[Liz Earle]], hair and make-up artists Andrew and Liz Collinge, and wine expert Charles Metcalfe. The theme tune was by David Pringle, who also wrote opening music for ''[[Wheel of Fortune (UK game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', ''[[Fun House (UK game show)|Fun House]]'' and ''[[The Pyramid Game]]''.\n\nTo end the first series, in 1989, the show was presented via satellite from Disneyland, California. Produced by Granada's Field Producer, Brian Thomas, the set was built directly in front of 'Sleeping Beauty Castle', a first for Disney.

A typical key is a small piece of metal consisting of two parts: the ''bit'' or ''blade'', which slides into the [[keyhole|keyway]] of the lock and distinguishes between different keys, and the ''bow'', which is left protruding so that torque can be applied by the user. In its simplest implementation, a key operates one lock or set of locks that are keyed alike, a lock/key system where each similarly keyed lock requires the same, unique key. The key serves as a [[security token]] for access to the locked area; only persons having the correct key can open the lock and gain access. In more complex mechanical lock/key systems, two different keys, one of which is known as the master key, serve to open the lock.

His double acting lever lock required the lever to be lifted to a certain height by having a slot cut in the lever, so lifting the lever too far was as bad as not lifting the lever far enough. This type of lock is still used today.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pulford|first=Graham W.|title=High-Security Mechanical Locks : An Encyclopedic Reference|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=0-7506-8437-2|page=317}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Chubb lock.jpg|thumb|Diagram of a [[Chubb detector lock]]]]\nThe lever tumbler lock was greatly improved by [[Jeremiah Chubb]] in 1818. A burglary in [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth Dockyard]] prompted the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British Government]] to announce a competition to produce a lock that could be opened only with its own key.<ref name=\":1\" /> Chubb developed the [[Chubb detector lock]], which incorporated an [[Combination lock#Internal mechanisms|integral security feature]] that could frustrate unauthorized access attempts and would indicate to the lock's owner if it had been interfered with.

Chubb made various improvements to his lock: his 1824 improved design didn't require a special regulator key to reset the lock; by 1847 his keys used six levers rather than four; and he later introduced a disc that allowed the key to pass but narrowed the field of view, hiding the levers from anybody attempting to pick the lock.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Roper, C.A. |author2=Phillips, Bill |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2001|title=The Complete Book of Locks and Locksmithing|publisher=McGraw-Hill Publishing|isbn=0-07-137494-9}}</ref> The Chubb brothers also received a patent for the first burglar-resisting [[safe]] and began production in 1835.\n\nThe designs of Barron and Chubb were based on the use of movable levers, but [[Joseph Bramah]], a prolific inventor, developed an alternative method in 1784. His lock used a cylindrical key with precise notches along the surface; these moved the metal slides that impeded the turning of the bolt into an exact alignment, allowing the lock to open. The lock was at the limits of the precision manufacturing capabilities of the time and was said by its inventor to be unpickable. In the same year Bramah started the Bramah Locks company at 124 Piccadilly, and displayed the \"Challenge Lock\" in the window of his shop from 1790, challenging \"...the artist who can make an instrument that will pick or open this lock\" for the reward of \u00a3200. The challenge stood for over 67 years until, at the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851, the American locksmith [[Alfred Charles Hobbs]] was able to open the lock and, following some argument about the circumstances under which he had opened it, was awarded the prize. Hobbs' attempt required some 51 hours, spread over 16 days.\n\nThe earliest patent for a double-acting [[pin tumbler lock]] was granted to American physician Abraham O. Stansbury in England in 1805,<ref>{{cite book|title=The Complete Book of Home, Site, and Office Security: Selecting, Installing, and Troubleshooting Systems and Devices|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=05ITGwH8rV8C&pg=PA11&dq=Abraham+O.+Stansbury+and+pin+tumbler+lock&hl=en&sa=X&ei=shDiT-2pMofO9QTf66CHCA&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Abraham%20O.%20Stansbury%20and%20pin%20tumbler%20lock&f=false|page=11|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121072851/https://books.google.com/books?id=05ITGwH8rV8C&pg=PA11&dq=Abraham+O.+Stansbury+and+pin+tumbler+lock&hl=en&sa=X&ei=shDiT-2pMofO9QTf66CHCA&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Abraham%20O.%20Stansbury%20and%20pin%20tumbler%20lock&f=false|archivedate=2016-11-21}}</ref> but the modern version, still in use today, was invented by American [[Linus Yale Sr.]] in 1848.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Geek Atlas: 128 Places Where Science and Technology Come Alive|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HhEC0q-O1ewC&pg=PA445&lpg=PA445&dq=Linus+Yale,+Sr.+modern+pin+tumbler+lock&source=bl&ots=MhDEksIeaw&sig=HqrCbHyFvLDC2BN5Mzt4SiFby_w&hl=en&sa=X&ei=r4PiT-vyCIn-8ATL57iGCA&ved=0CGIQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=Linus%20Yale%2C%20Sr.%20modern%20pin%20tumbler%20lock&f=false|page=445|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160501062428/https://books.google.com/books?id=HhEC0q-O1ewC&pg=PA445&lpg=PA445&dq=Linus+Yale,+Sr.+modern+pin+tumbler+lock&source=bl&ots=MhDEksIeaw&sig=HqrCbHyFvLDC2BN5Mzt4SiFby_w&hl=en&sa=X&ei=r4PiT-vyCIn-8ATL57iGCA&ved=0CGIQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=Linus%20Yale%2C%20Sr.%20modern%20pin%20tumbler%20lock&f=false|archivedate=2016-05-01}}</ref> This lock design used [[pin]]s of varying lengths to prevent the lock from opening without the correct key.

The tubular key has several half-cylinder indentations which align with the pins.\n</gallery>\nA [[warded lock]] uses a set of obstructions, or wards, to prevent the lock from opening unless the correct key is inserted. The key has notches or slots that correspond to the obstructions in the lock, allowing it to rotate freely inside the lock. Warded locks are typically reserved for low-security applications as a well-designed [[skeleton key]] can successfully open a wide variety of warded locks.\n\nThe [[pin tumbler lock]] uses a set of pins to prevent the lock from opening unless the correct key is inserted. The key has a series of grooves on either side of the key's blade that limit the type of lock the key can slide into. As the key slides into the lock, the horizontal grooves on the blade align with the [[Warded lock|wards]] in the [[keyway]] allowing or denying entry to the [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]. A series of pointed teeth and notches on the blade, called [[Bit (key)|bitting]]s, then allow [[Pin tumbler lock|pins]] to move up and down until they are in line with the [[Shear line (locksmithing)|shear line]] of the inner and outer cylinder, allowing the cylinder or [[cam]] to rotate freely and the lock to open.\n\nA [[wafer tumbler lock]] is similar to the pin tumbler lock and works on a similar principle. However, unlike the pin lock (where each pin consists of two or more pieces) each wafer is a single piece. The wafer tumbler lock is often incorrectly referred to as a disc tumbler lock, which uses an entirely different mechanism. The wafer lock is relatively inexpensive to produce and is often used in automobiles and cabinetry.\n\nThe [[disc tumbler lock]] or [[Abloy]] lock is composed of slotted rotating detainer discs.\n\nThe [[lever tumbler lock]] uses a set of levers to prevent the bolt from moving in the lock. In its simplest form, lifting the tumbler above a certain height will allow the bolt to slide past. Lever locks are commonly [[Mortise lock|recessed]] inside wooden doors or on some older forms of padlocks, including fire brigade padlocks.\n\nA [[magnetic keyed lock]] is a locking mechanism whereby the key utilizes magnets as part of the locking and unlocking mechanism. A magnetic key would use from one to many small magnets oriented so that the North and South poles would equate to a combination to push or pull the lock's internal tumblers thus releasing the lock.\n\n===With electronic keys===\nAn [[electronic lock]] works by means of an electric current and is usually connected to an [[access control]] system. In addition to the pin and tumbler used in standard locks, electronic locks connects the [[dead bolt|bolt]] or [[cylinder lock|cylinder]] to a motor within the door using a part called an actuator. Types of electronic locks include the following:\n\nA [[keycard lock]] operates with a flat card of similar dimensions as a [[credit card]]. In order to open the door, one needs to successfully match the signature within the '''keycard'''.\n\nThe lock in a typical [[remote keyless system]] operates with a [[smart key]] radio transmitter. The lock typically accepts a particular valid code only once, and the smart key transmits a different [[rolling code]] every time the button is pressed.\nGenerally the car door can be opened with either a valid code by radio transmission, or with a (non-electronic) pin tumbler key.\nThe ignition switch may require a [[transponder car key]] to both open a pin tumbler lock and also transmit a valid code by radio transmission.\n\nA smart lock is an electromechanics lock that gets instructions to lock and unlock the door from an authorized device using a [[Key (cryptography)|cryptographic key]] and wireless protocol. Smart locks have begun to be used more commonly in residential areas, often controlled with [[smartphones]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ditch the keys: it's time to get a smart lock|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/improvement/security/ditch-the-keys-its-time-to-get-a-smart-lock-16200140|website=Popular Mechanics|accessdate=15 June 2016|date=26 November 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216010141/http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/improvement/security/ditch-the-keys-its-time-to-get-a-smart-lock-16200140|archivedate=16 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Kisi And KeyMe, two smart phone apps, might make house keys obsolete|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/26/house-keys-extinct_n_4339682.html|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=9 June 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311201754/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/26/house-keys-extinct_n_4339682.html|archivedate=11 March 2015}}</ref> Smart locks are used in [[coworking]] spaces and offices to enable keyless office entry.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kurutz|first1=Steven|title=Losing The Key|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/12/garden/losing-the-key.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=9 June 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160103232758/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/12/garden/losing-the-key.html?_r=0|archivedate=3 January 2016}}</ref>  In addition, electronic locks cannot be picked with conventional tools.\n\n== Locksmithing ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:Mendel I 072 v.jpg|thumb|Locksmith, 1451]]\n[[Locksmithing]] is a traditional trade, and in most countries requires completion of an [[apprenticeship]]. The level of formal education required varies from country to country, from no qualifications required at all in the UK,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.locksmiths.co.uk/faq/locksmith-qualifications/|title=What qualifications do I need to be a locksmith?|website=Master Locksmiths Association|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> to a simple training certificate awarded by an employer, to a full [[diploma]] from an [[engineering]] [[college]]. Locksmiths may be commercial (working out of a storefront), mobile (working out of a vehicle), institutional, or investigational (forensic locksmiths). They may specialize in one aspect of the skill, such as an automotive lock specialist, a master key system specialist or a safe technician. Many also act as security consultants, but not all security consultants have the skills and knowledge of a locksmith.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nHistorically, locksmiths constructed or repaired an entire lock, including its constituent parts. The rise of cheap mass production has made this less common; the vast majority of locks are repaired through like-for-like replacements, high-security safes and strongboxes being the most common exception. Many locksmiths also work on any existing door hardware, including door closers, hinges, electric strikes, and frame repairs, or service [[electronic lock]]s by making keys for transponder-equipped vehicles and implementing access control systems.\n\nAlthough the fitting and replacement of keys remains an important part of locksmithing, modern locksmiths are primarily involved in the installation of high quality lock-sets and the design, implementation, and management of keying and key control systems. Locksmiths are frequently required to determine the level of risk to an individual or institution and then recommend and implement appropriate combinations of equipment and policies to create a \"security layer\" that exceeds the reasonable gain of an intruder.\n\n===Key duplication===\n{{main|Key duplication}}\n[[File:Copia llave video.ogv|thumb|Video showing the process of cutting a key]]\n\nTraditional '''key cutting''' is the primary method of key duplication. It is a [[subtractive manufacturing|subtractive process]] named after the metalworking process of [[metalworking#Cutting processes|cutting]], where a flat ''blank'' key is ground down to form the same shape as the ''template'' (original) key. The process roughly follows these stages:\n# The original key is fitted into a [[vice]] in a machine, with a blank attached to a parallel vise which is mechanically linked.\n# The original key is moved along a guide in a movement which follows the key's shape, while the blank is moved in the same pattern against a cutting wheel by the mechanical linkage between the vices.\n# After cutting, the new key is [[burr (metal)|deburred]] by scrubbing it with a metal brush to remove particles of metal which could be dangerously sharp and foul locks.\n\nModern key cutting replaces the mechanical key following aspect with a process in which the original key is scanned electronically, processed by software, stored, then used to guide a cutting wheel when a key is produced.  The capability to store electronic copies of the key's shape allows for key shapes to be stored for key cutting by any party that has access to the key image.\n\nDifferent key cutting machines are more or less automated, using different milling or grinding equipment, and follow the design of early 20th century key duplicators.\n\nKey duplication is available in many retail [[hardware stores]] and as a service of the specialized locksmith, though the correct key blank may not be available. More recently, online services for duplicating keys have become available.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Symbolism ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\n[[File:Coat of arms Holy See.svg|thumb|upright|[[Coat of arms]] of the [[Holy See]]|alt=]]\n\n===Heraldry===\nKeys appear in various symbols and coats of arms, the best-known being that of the [[Holy See]]&nbsp;\u2013 derived from the phrase in {{bibleverse||Matthew|16:19}} which promises [[Saint Peter]], in Roman Catholic tradition the first [[pope]], the [[Keys of Heaven]].

A typical key is a small piece of metal consisting of two parts: the ''bit'' or ''blade'', which slides into the [[keyhole|keyway]] of the lock and distinguishes between different keys, and the ''bow'', which is left protruding so that torque can be applied by the user. In its simplest implementation, a key operates one lock or set of locks that are keyed alike, a lock/key system where each similarly keyed lock requires the same, unique key. The key serves as a [[security token]] for access to the locked area; only persons having the correct key can open the lock and gain access. In more complex mechanical lock/key systems, two different keys, one of which is known as the master key, serve to open the lock.

His double acting lever lock required the lever to be lifted to a certain height by having a slot cut in the lever, so lifting the lever too far was as bad as not lifting the lever far enough. This type of lock is still used today.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pulford|first=Graham W.|title=High-Security Mechanical Locks : An Encyclopedic Reference|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=0-7506-8437-2|page=317}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Chubb lock.jpg|thumb|Diagram of a [[Chubb detector lock]]]]\nThe lever tumbler lock was greatly improved by [[Jeremiah Chubb]] in 1818. A burglary in [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth Dockyard]] prompted the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British Government]] to announce a competition to produce a lock that could be opened only with its own key.<ref name=\":1\" /> Chubb developed the [[Chubb detector lock]], which incorporated an [[Combination lock#Internal mechanisms|integral security feature]] that could frustrate unauthorized access attempts and would indicate to the lock's owner if it had been interfered with. Chubb was awarded \u00a3100 after a trained lock-picker failed to break the lock after 3 months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wolverhamptonhistory.org.uk/work/industry/lock_making2|title=Lock Making: Chubb & Son's Lock & Safe Co Ltd|publisher=Wolverhampton City Council|year=2005|accessdate=16 November 2006 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1820, Jeremiah joined his brother [[Charles Chubb (businessman)|Charles]] in starting their own lock company, [[Chubb Locks|Chubb]]. Chubb made various improvements to his lock: his 1824 improved design didn't require a special regulator key to reset the lock; by 1847 his keys used six levers rather than four; and he later introduced a disc that allowed the key to pass but narrowed the field of view, hiding the levers from anybody attempting to pick the lock.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Roper, C.A. |author2=Phillips, Bill |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2001|title=The Complete Book of Locks and Locksmithing|publisher=McGraw-Hill Publishing|isbn=0-07-137494-9}}</ref> The Chubb brothers also received a patent for the first burglar-resisting [[safe]] and began production in 1835.\n\nThe designs of Barron and Chubb were based on the use of movable levers, but [[Joseph Bramah]], a prolific inventor, developed an alternative method in 1784. His lock used a cylindrical key with precise notches along the surface; these moved the metal slides that impeded the turning of the bolt into an exact alignment, allowing the lock to open. The lock was at the limits of the precision manufacturing capabilities of the time and was said by its inventor to be unpickable. In the same year Bramah started the Bramah Locks company at 124 Piccadilly, and displayed the \"Challenge Lock\" in the window of his shop from 1790, challenging \"...the artist who can make an instrument that will pick or open this lock\" for the reward of \u00a3200. The challenge stood for over 67 years until, at the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851, the American locksmith [[Alfred Charles Hobbs]] was able to open the lock and, following some argument about the circumstances under which he had opened it, was awarded the prize. Hobbs' attempt required some 51 hours, spread over 16 days.\n\nThe earliest patent for a double-acting [[pin tumbler lock]] was granted to American physician Abraham O. Stansbury in England in 1805,<ref>{{cite book|title=The Complete Book of Home, Site, and Office Security: Selecting, Installing, and Troubleshooting Systems and Devices|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=05ITGwH8rV8C&pg=PA11&dq=Abraham+O.+Stansbury+and+pin+tumbler+lock&hl=en&sa=X&ei=shDiT-2pMofO9QTf66CHCA&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Abraham%20O.%20Stansbury%20and%20pin%20tumbler%20lock&f=false|page=11|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121072851/https://books.google.com/books?id=05ITGwH8rV8C&pg=PA11&dq=Abraham+O.+Stansbury+and+pin+tumbler+lock&hl=en&sa=X&ei=shDiT-2pMofO9QTf66CHCA&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Abraham%20O.%20Stansbury%20and%20pin%20tumbler%20lock&f=false|archivedate=2016-11-21}}</ref> but the modern version, still in use today, was invented by American [[Linus Yale Sr.]] in 1848.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Geek Atlas: 128 Places Where Science and Technology Come Alive|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HhEC0q-O1ewC&pg=PA445&lpg=PA445&dq=Linus+Yale,+Sr.+modern+pin+tumbler+lock&source=bl&ots=MhDEksIeaw&sig=HqrCbHyFvLDC2BN5Mzt4SiFby_w&hl=en&sa=X&ei=r4PiT-vyCIn-8ATL57iGCA&ved=0CGIQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=Linus%20Yale%2C%20Sr.%20modern%20pin%20tumbler%20lock&f=false|page=445|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160501062428/https://books.google.com/books?id=HhEC0q-O1ewC&pg=PA445&lpg=PA445&dq=Linus+Yale,+Sr.+modern+pin+tumbler+lock&source=bl&ots=MhDEksIeaw&sig=HqrCbHyFvLDC2BN5Mzt4SiFby_w&hl=en&sa=X&ei=r4PiT-vyCIn-8ATL57iGCA&ved=0CGIQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=Linus%20Yale%2C%20Sr.%20modern%20pin%20tumbler%20lock&f=false|archivedate=2016-05-01}}</ref> This lock design used [[pin]]s of varying lengths to prevent the lock from opening without the correct key. In 1861, [[Linus Yale Jr.]] was inspired by the original 1840s pin-tumbler lock designed by his father, thus inventing and patenting a smaller flat key with serrated edges as well as pins of varying lengths within the lock itself, the same design of the pin-tumbler lock which still remains in use today.<ref>{{cite web|title=Inventor of the Week Archive|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/yale.html|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529222941/http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/yale.html|archivedate=2013-05-29}}</ref> The modern Yale lock is essentially a more developed version of the Egyptian lock.\n\nDespite some improvement in key design since, the majority of locks today are still variants of the designs invented by Bramah, Chubb and Yale.\n\n== Types of lock ==\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Bicycle lock]]\n* [[Latch (hardware)#Cam lock|Cam lock]]\n* [[Gun safety#Locks|Chamber lock]]\n* [[Child safety lock]]\n* [[Chubb detector lock]]\n* [[Combination lock]]\n* [[Cylinder lock]]\n* [[Dead bolt]]\n* [[Electric strike]]\n* [[Electronic lock]]\n* [[Lever tumbler lock]]\n* [[Lock screen]]\n* [[Luggage lock]]\n* [[Magnetic keyed lock]]\n* [[Electromagnetic lock|Magnetic lock]]\n* [[Mortise lock]]\n* [[Padlock]]\n* [[Pin tumbler lock]]\n* [[Police lock]]\n* [[Protector lock]]\n* [[Rim lock]]\n* [[Time lock]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===With physical keys===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\" class=\"center\">\nPin tumbler no key.svg|Pin tumbler lock: without a key in the lock, the driver pins (blue) are pushed downwards, preventing the plug (yellow) from rotating.

The tubular key has several half-cylinder indentations which align with the pins.\n</gallery>\nA [[warded lock]] uses a set of obstructions, or wards, to prevent the lock from opening unless the correct key is inserted. The key has notches or slots that correspond to the obstructions in the lock, allowing it to rotate freely inside the lock. Warded locks are typically reserved for low-security applications as a well-designed [[skeleton key]] can successfully open a wide variety of warded locks.\n\nThe [[pin tumbler lock]] uses a set of pins to prevent the lock from opening unless the correct key is inserted. The key has a series of grooves on either side of the key's blade that limit the type of lock the key can slide into. As the key slides into the lock, the horizontal grooves on the blade align with the [[Warded lock|wards]] in the [[keyway]] allowing or denying entry to the [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]. A series of pointed teeth and notches on the blade, called [[Bit (key)|bitting]]s, then allow [[Pin tumbler lock|pins]] to move up and down until they are in line with the [[Shear line (locksmithing)|shear line]] of the inner and outer cylinder, allowing the cylinder or [[cam]] to rotate freely and the lock to open.\n\nA [[wafer tumbler lock]] is similar to the pin tumbler lock and works on a similar principle. However, unlike the pin lock (where each pin consists of two or more pieces) each wafer is a single piece. The wafer tumbler lock is often incorrectly referred to as a disc tumbler lock, which uses an entirely different mechanism. The wafer lock is relatively inexpensive to produce and is often used in automobiles and cabinetry.\n\nThe [[disc tumbler lock]] or [[Abloy]] lock is composed of slotted rotating detainer discs.\n\nThe [[lever tumbler lock]] uses a set of levers to prevent the bolt from moving in the lock. In its simplest form, lifting the tumbler above a certain height will allow the bolt to slide past. Lever locks are commonly [[Mortise lock|recessed]] inside wooden doors or on some older forms of padlocks, including fire brigade padlocks.\n\nA [[magnetic keyed lock]] is a locking mechanism whereby the key utilizes magnets as part of the locking and unlocking mechanism. A magnetic key would use from one to many small magnets oriented so that the North and South poles would equate to a combination to push or pull the lock's internal tumblers thus releasing the lock.\n\n===With electronic keys===\nAn [[electronic lock]] works by means of an electric current and is usually connected to an [[access control]] system. In addition to the pin and tumbler used in standard locks, electronic locks connects the [[dead bolt|bolt]] or [[cylinder lock|cylinder]] to a motor within the door using a part called an actuator. Types of electronic locks include the following:\n\nA [[keycard lock]] operates with a flat card of similar dimensions as a [[credit card]]. In order to open the door, one needs to successfully match the signature within the '''keycard'''.\n\nThe lock in a typical [[remote keyless system]] operates with a [[smart key]] radio transmitter. The lock typically accepts a particular valid code only once, and the smart key transmits a different [[rolling code]] every time the button is pressed.\nGenerally the car door can be opened with either a valid code by radio transmission, or with a (non-electronic) pin tumbler key.\nThe ignition switch may require a [[transponder car key]] to both open a pin tumbler lock and also transmit a valid code by radio transmission.\n\nA smart lock is an electromechanics lock that gets instructions to lock and unlock the door from an authorized device using a [[Key (cryptography)|cryptographic key]] and wireless protocol. Smart locks have begun to be used more commonly in residential areas, often controlled with [[smartphones]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ditch the keys: it's time to get a smart lock|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/improvement/security/ditch-the-keys-its-time-to-get-a-smart-lock-16200140|website=Popular Mechanics|accessdate=15 June 2016|date=26 November 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216010141/http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/improvement/security/ditch-the-keys-its-time-to-get-a-smart-lock-16200140|archivedate=16 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Kisi And KeyMe, two smart phone apps, might make house keys obsolete|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/26/house-keys-extinct_n_4339682.html|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=9 June 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311201754/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/26/house-keys-extinct_n_4339682.html|archivedate=11 March 2015}}</ref> Smart locks are used in [[coworking]] spaces and offices to enable keyless office entry.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kurutz|first1=Steven|title=Losing The Key|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/12/garden/losing-the-key.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=9 June 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160103232758/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/12/garden/losing-the-key.html?_r=0|archivedate=3 January 2016}}</ref>  In addition, electronic locks cannot be picked with conventional tools.\n\n== Locksmithing ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:Mendel I 072 v.jpg|thumb|Locksmith, 1451]]\n[[Locksmithing]] is a traditional trade, and in most countries requires completion of an [[apprenticeship]]. The level of formal education required varies from country to country, from no qualifications required at all in the UK,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.locksmiths.co.uk/faq/locksmith-qualifications/|title=What qualifications do I need to be a locksmith?|website=Master Locksmiths Association|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> to a simple training certificate awarded by an employer, to a full [[diploma]] from an [[engineering]] [[college]]. Locksmiths may be commercial (working out of a storefront), mobile (working out of a vehicle), institutional, or investigational (forensic locksmiths). They may specialize in one aspect of the skill, such as an automotive lock specialist, a master key system specialist or a safe technician. Many also act as security consultants, but not all security consultants have the skills and knowledge of a locksmith.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nHistorically, locksmiths constructed or repaired an entire lock, including its constituent parts. The rise of cheap mass production has made this less common; the vast majority of locks are repaired through like-for-like replacements, high-security safes and strongboxes being the most common exception. Many locksmiths also work on any existing door hardware, including door closers, hinges, electric strikes, and frame repairs, or service [[electronic lock]]s by making keys for transponder-equipped vehicles and implementing access control systems.\n\nAlthough the fitting and replacement of keys remains an important part of locksmithing, modern locksmiths are primarily involved in the installation of high quality lock-sets and the design, implementation, and management of keying and key control systems. Locksmiths are frequently required to determine the level of risk to an individual or institution and then recommend and implement appropriate combinations of equipment and policies to create a \"security layer\" that exceeds the reasonable gain of an intruder.\n\n===Key duplication===\n{{main|Key duplication}}\n[[File:Copia llave video.ogv|thumb|Video showing the process of cutting a key]]\n\nTraditional '''key cutting''' is the primary method of key duplication. It is a [[subtractive manufacturing|subtractive process]] named after the metalworking process of [[metalworking#Cutting processes|cutting]], where a flat ''blank'' key is ground down to form the same shape as the ''template'' (original) key. The process roughly follows these stages:\n# The original key is fitted into a [[vice]] in a machine, with a blank attached to a parallel vise which is mechanically linked.\n# The original key is moved along a guide in a movement which follows the key's shape, while the blank is moved in the same pattern against a cutting wheel by the mechanical linkage between the vices.\n# After cutting, the new key is [[burr (metal)|deburred]] by scrubbing it with a metal brush to remove particles of metal which could be dangerously sharp and foul locks.\n\nModern key cutting replaces the mechanical key following aspect with a process in which the original key is scanned electronically, processed by software, stored, then used to guide a cutting wheel when a key is produced.  The capability to store electronic copies of the key's shape allows for key shapes to be stored for key cutting by any party that has access to the key image.\n\nDifferent key cutting machines are more or less automated, using different milling or grinding equipment, and follow the design of early 20th century key duplicators.\n\nKey duplication is available in many retail [[hardware stores]] and as a service of the specialized locksmith, though the correct key blank may not be available. More recently, online services for duplicating keys have become available.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Symbolism ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\n[[File:Coat of arms Holy See.svg|thumb|upright|[[Coat of arms]] of the [[Holy See]]|alt=]]\n\n===Heraldry===\nKeys appear in various symbols and coats of arms, the best-known being that of the [[Holy See]]&nbsp;\u2013 derived from the phrase in {{bibleverse||Matthew|16:19}} which promises [[Saint Peter]], in Roman Catholic tradition the first [[pope]], the [[Keys of Heaven]].

The horn logo was slightly revised in 2006. The original uniform design consisted of white pants, gold trim, and either purple or white jerseys. From 1962 to 1964, the Vikings wore purple pants with their white jerseys (The Vikings, with their new uniform, still wear, on occasion, purple pants with yellow and white trim). In a design that was unique among American football teams, the white jerseys had a completely different stripe pattern, which was over the shoulders, than the purple ones, which was around the sleeve cuff. These unique shoulder stripes on the white jerseys did not appear until 1969, the year they went to their first Super Bowl. There have also been minor changes to the uniform design throughout the years, such as changing the color of the face mask from gray to white in 1980, and then to purple in 1985. In addition, the Norseman logo was added to the sleeves in 1996, and the purple jersey stripes were toned down with that change; the ''TV numbers'', previously located on the jersey sleeves, moved up to the shoulders as well that year. The Vikings continued to wear black shoes until [[Les Steckel]] became head coach in 1984; they were the last NFL team to make the change from black to white shoes.

From 1962 to 1964, the Vikings wore purple pants with their white jerseys (The Vikings, with their new uniform, still wear, on occasion, purple pants with yellow and white trim). In a design that was unique among American football teams, the white jerseys had a completely different stripe pattern, which was over the shoulders, than the purple ones, which was around the sleeve cuff. These unique shoulder stripes on the white jerseys did not appear until 1969, the year they went to their first Super Bowl. There have also been minor changes to the uniform design throughout the years, such as changing the color of the face mask from gray to white in 1980, and then to purple in 1985. In addition, the Norseman logo was added to the sleeves in 1996, and the purple jersey stripes were toned down with that change; the ''TV numbers'', previously located on the jersey sleeves, moved up to the shoulders as well that year. The Vikings continued to wear black shoes until [[Les Steckel]] became head coach in 1984; they were the last NFL team to make the change from black to white shoes.
