Set in Texas, the film tells the tale of a shifty, sleazy bar owner who hires a private detective to kill his wife and her lover. The film contains elements that point to their future direction: distinctive homages to genre movies (in this case [[film noir|noir]] and [[horror film|horror]]), [[plot twist]]s layered over a simple story, dark humor, and ''[[mise-en-sc\u00e8ne]]''. The film starred [[Frances McDormand]], who went on to feature in many of the Coen brothers' films (and marry Joel).

Joel and Raimi also made [[cameo appearance]]s in ''[[Spies Like Us]]'' (1985).\n\nThe brothers' next film was ''[[Raising Arizona]]'' (1987), the story of an unlikely married couple: ex-convict H.I. ([[Nicolas Cage]]) and police officer Ed ([[Holly Hunter]]), who long for a baby but are unable to conceive. When a local furniture tycoon ([[Trey Wilson]]) appears on television with his newly born quintuplets and jokes that they \"are more than we can handle\", H.I. steals one of the quintuplets to bring up as their own. The film featured Frances McDormand, [[John Goodman]], [[William Forsythe (actor)|William Forsythe]], [[Sam McMurray]], and [[Randall \"Tex\" Cobb]].\n\n=== 1990s ===\n''[[Miller's Crossing]]'', released in 1990, starred [[Albert Finney]], [[Gabriel Byrne]], and [[John Turturro]]. The film is about feuding gangsters in the [[Prohibition]] era, inspired by [[Dashiell Hammett]]'s novels ''[[Red Harvest]]'' (1929) and ''[[The Glass Key]]'' (serialized in 1930).\n\nThe following year, they released ''[[Barton Fink]]'' (1991); set in 1941, in which a New York playwright, the eponymous Barton Fink (played by John Turturro), moves to Los Angeles to write a [[B-movie]]. He settles down in his hotel room to commence writing but suffers [[writer's block]] until he is invaded by the man next door (John Goodman).

The film [[box office bomb|bombed at the box office]] ($30 million budget, $3 million gross in the USA), even though it featured [[Paul Newman]] and [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]]. [[Frances McDormand]] appears in a brief uncredited role.\n\nThe Coens wrote and directed the crime thriller ''[[Fargo (film)|Fargo]]'' (1996), set in their home state of [[Minnesota]]. Jerry Lundegaard ([[William H. Macy]]), who has serious financial problems, has his wife kidnapped so that his wealthy father-in-law will pay the ransom.

Produced on a small budget of $7 million, ''Fargo'' was a critical and commercial success, with particular praise for its dialogue and McDormand's performance.

The only exception to this rule is if the co-directors are an \"established duo\". From 2004 on, they were able to share the director credit and since then, the Coen brothers have become only the third duo to be nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Director]]. The first two pairs to achieve this were [[Robert Wise]] and [[Jerome Robbins]] (who won for ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'' in 1961), and [[Warren Beatty]] and [[Buck Henry]] (who were nominated for ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'' in 1978).\n\nOnly seven other directors have won three Oscars for the same film, a distinction the duo shares with [[Billy Wilder]], [[James L. Brooks]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[James Cameron]], [[Peter Jackson]], [[Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu]] and [[Bong Joon-ho]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nWith four Academy Award nominations for ''No Country for Old Men'' for the duo ([[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] as Roderick Jaynes), the Coen brothers have tied the record for the most nominations by a single nominee (counting an \"established duo\" as one nominee) for the same film. [[Orson Welles]] set the record in 1941 with ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' being nominated for Best Picture (though at the time, individual producers were not named as nominees), Best Director, [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. [[Warren Beatty]] received the same nominations, first for ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'' in 1978 and again in 1981 with ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]''. [[Alan Menken]] also then achieved the same feat when he was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Score]] and triple-nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Song]] for ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' in 1991. In 2018, [[Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n]] was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] for ''[[Roma (2018 film)|Roma]]''.\n\n== Filmography ==\n{{main|Coen brothers filmography}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* ''[[Blood Simple]]'' (1984)\n* ''[[Raising Arizona]]'' (1987)\n* ''[[Miller's Crossing]]'' (1990)\n* ''[[Barton Fink]]'' (1991)\n* ''[[The Hudsucker Proxy]]'' (1994)\n* ''[[Fargo (film)|Fargo]]'' (1996)\n* ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'' (1998)\n* ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'' (2000)\n* ''[[The Man Who Wasn't There (2001 film)|The Man Who Wasn't There]]'' (2001)\n* ''[[Intolerable Cruelty]]'' (2003)\n* ''[[The Ladykillers (2004 film)|The Ladykillers]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]'' (2007)\n* ''[[Burn After Reading]]'' (2008)\n* ''[[A Serious Man]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[True Grit (2010 film)|True Grit]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[Inside Llewyn Davis]]'' (2013)\n* ''[[Hail, Caesar!]]'' (2016)\n* ''[[The Ballad of Buster Scruggs]]'' (2018)\n* ''[[Macbeth (upcoming film)|Macbeth]]'' (TBA)\n}}\n\n== Collaborators ==\n{{See also|List of frequent Coen Brothers collaborators}}\n[[File:Frances McDormand 2015 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Joel's wife [[Frances McDormand]] is their most frequent acting collaborator]]\nThe Coen brothers frequently cast certain actors in their films, most frequently [[Frances McDormand]], [[Steve Buscemi]], [[John Goodman]], [[Jon Polito]], [[George Clooney]], and [[John Turturro]].

Joel and Raimi also made [[cameo appearance]]s in ''[[Spies Like Us]]'' (1985).\n\nThe brothers' next film was ''[[Raising Arizona]]'' (1987), the story of an unlikely married couple: ex-convict H.I. ([[Nicolas Cage]]) and police officer Ed ([[Holly Hunter]]), who long for a baby but are unable to conceive. When a local furniture tycoon ([[Trey Wilson]]) appears on television with his newly born quintuplets and jokes that they \"are more than we can handle\", H.I. steals one of the quintuplets to bring up as their own.

He settles down in his hotel room to commence writing but suffers [[writer's block]] until he is invaded by the man next door (John Goodman).

[[Orson Welles]] set the record in 1941 with ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' being nominated for Best Picture (though at the time, individual producers were not named as nominees), Best Director, [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]].

He lectured in music at [[University College Cork]] from 1963 until his death in 1971. He became a household name in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] through his participation in [[Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann]], compositions, writings and broadcasts. His best-known pieces in the classical tradition include ''Nomos No. 1: Hercules Dux Ferrariae'' (1957), but he became particularly famous for his film scores ''Mise \u00c9ire'' (1959) and ''[[Saoirse (\u00d3 Riada)|Saoirse?]]'' (1960). He left a lasting influence as founder and director of the ensemble Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann (from 1961).\n\n\u00d3 Riada died in 1971, two months after his fortieth birthday.<ref>\"[http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/books/composer-sean-o-riada-died-from-genetic-liver-weakness-26788107.html].

After beginning school in Adare, he later attended [[St Finbarr's College, Farranferris]] and whilst he was there he received musical education from [[Aloys Fleischmann (Senior)]]. He moved to [[St Munchin's College]] in Limerick where he completed his Leaving Certificate in 1948.\n\nHe played violin, piano and organ, and studied Greek and Latin classics at University College Cork, with [[Aloys Fleischmann|Aloys Fleischmann (Junior)]] and graduated in 1952. While at college, \u00d3 Riada was the auditor of the [[UCC Philosophical Society]]. That year he became assistant director for [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|Radio \u00c9ireann]]. He married Ruth Coughlan in 1953.\n\nDuring the evening he played piano with dance bands. In 1955 \u00d3 Riada spent several months in France and consolidated his interest in techniques of musical modernism. On his return in July he became music director of the Abbey Theatre, Dublin (until 1962), where he wrote, arranged and directed music for the small pit orchestra, also continuing his work in radio. Most of his original, modern orchestral compositions were also written in this time, which included his ''Nomos No. 1: Hercules Dux Ferrariae'' for string orchestra (1957), ''Nomos No. 4'' for piano and orchestra (1958) and the ''Triptyche pour orchestre'' (1960) as well as an early version of his ambitious ''Nomos No. 2'' for baritone solo, mixed choir and orchestra (1965). As his work with Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann developed, his engagement with the modern musical avantgarde decreased, but was never abandoned.\n\n==Mise \u00c9ire==\n\u00d3 Riada composed and directed orchestral music for theatre and film, combining [[Traditional Irish music|traditional Irish tunes]] and \"[[Sean-n\u00f3s song|sean-n\u00f3s]]\" (old style) songs in the classical tradition, similar to [[Musical nationalism|nationalist composers]] such as [[Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] (Czech), [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]] (Hungarian) and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] (English). In 1959 he scored a documentary film by [[George Morrison (documentary maker)|George Morrison]] called ''[[Mise \u00c9ire]]'' (\"I am Ireland\"), about the founding of the [[Irish Republic]]. The recording is conducted by \u00d3 Riada himself. ''Mise \u00c9ire'' brought him national acclaim and allowed him to start a series of programmes on Irish radio called ''Our Musical Heritage''. \u00d3 Riada told people that one should listen to [[sean-n\u00f3s song]] either as a child would listen or as if they were songs from [[India]].\n\n==Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann==\nBetween 1961 and 1969 \u00d3 Riada led the [[Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann]] group. They played in concert halls dressed in black suits with white shirts and black bow ties, but relied on traditional songs and tunes. An ordinary [[Music of Ireland Traditional music|c\u00e9ilidh band]] or show-band would have musicians who competed with each other to grab the audience's attention. Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann played sparse lucid arrangements. \u00d3 Riada sat in the middle at front playing a harpsichord and a [[bodhr\u00e1n]], a hand-held frame-drum. This was an instrument that had almost died out, being played only by small boys in street parades. Ceil\u00ed bands generally had jazz-band drum-kits. \u00d3 Riada also wanted to use the [[clarsach]] or wire-strung [[harp]] in the band, but as these were as yet unavailable, he played the [[harpsichord]] instead \u2013 in his opinion the nearest sound to a clarsach.<ref name=\"CooperDawe2005\">{{cite book|author1=David Cooper|author2=Kevin Dawe|title=The Mediterranean in Music: Critical Perspectives, Common Concerns, Cultural Differences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Di1KQc6-HCwC&pg=PA220|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-5407-9|pages=220\u2013}}</ref> The harpsichord he used on a regular basis was made by [[Cathal Gannon]]. Unknown to \u00d3 Riada, Irish folk music was being played ensemble-style in London pubs, but for most people of Ireland this was the first time they heard these tunes played by a band. For some, the membership of Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann overlapped with that of [[The Chieftains]]. They recorded the soundtrack of the film ''[[Playboy of the Western World]]'' (original play by [[John Millington Synge]]) in 1962. Their last public performance was in 1969, the album was then called \"\u00d3 Riada Sa Gaiety\".\n\n==Final years==\nIn 1963 \u00d3 Riada was appointed lecturer in music at [[University College, Cork]]. He moved to Ballyvourney, and not [[C\u00fail Aodha]] (a common misconception) in [[County Cork|West Cork]], an [[Gaeltacht|Irish-speaking area]], where he established [[C\u00f3r Ch\u00fail Aodha]], a male voice choir.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Biletz|first1=Frank A.|title=Historical Dictionary of Ireland|date=2013|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=0-8108-7091-6|page=326|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=rb8eAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA326#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref> He turned toward choral church music, composing two settings of the [[Mass (music)|Mass]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cox|first1=Gareth|title=Se\u00f3irse Bodley|date=2010|publisher=Field Day Publications|isbn=0-946755-48-5|page=114|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=bqsDoTw8ruAC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref> ''Ceol an Aifrinn'' (\"Music of the Mass\") was the first Mass written in the [[Irish language]].

Through his incorporation of modern and traditional techniques he became the single most influential figure in the revival of [[Irish traditional music]] during the 1960s.\n\n\u00d3 Riada's career began as a music director at [[Radio \u00c9ireann]] from 1954, after which he worked at the [[Abbey Theatre]] from 1955 to 1962. He lectured in music at [[University College Cork]] from 1963 until his death in 1971. He became a household name in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] through his participation in [[Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann]], compositions, writings and broadcasts. His best-known pieces in the classical tradition include ''Nomos No. 1: Hercules Dux Ferrariae'' (1957), but he became particularly famous for his film scores ''Mise \u00c9ire'' (1959) and ''[[Saoirse (\u00d3 Riada)|Saoirse?]]'' (1960). He left a lasting influence as founder and director of the ensemble Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann (from 1961).\n\n\u00d3 Riada died in 1971, two months after his fortieth birthday.<ref>\"[http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/books/composer-sean-o-riada-died-from-genetic-liver-weakness-26788107.html].

After beginning school in Adare, he later attended [[St Finbarr's College, Farranferris]] and whilst he was there he received musical education from [[Aloys Fleischmann (Senior)]]. He moved to [[St Munchin's College]] in Limerick where he completed his Leaving Certificate in 1948.\n\nHe played violin, piano and organ, and studied Greek and Latin classics at University College Cork, with [[Aloys Fleischmann|Aloys Fleischmann (Junior)]] and graduated in 1952. While at college, \u00d3 Riada was the auditor of the [[UCC Philosophical Society]]. That year he became assistant director for [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|Radio \u00c9ireann]]. He married Ruth Coughlan in 1953.\n\nDuring the evening he played piano with dance bands. In 1955 \u00d3 Riada spent several months in France and consolidated his interest in techniques of musical modernism. On his return in July he became music director of the Abbey Theatre, Dublin (until 1962), where he wrote, arranged and directed music for the small pit orchestra, also continuing his work in radio. Most of his original, modern orchestral compositions were also written in this time, which included his ''Nomos No. 1: Hercules Dux Ferrariae'' for string orchestra (1957), ''Nomos No. 4'' for piano and orchestra (1958) and the ''Triptyche pour orchestre'' (1960) as well as an early version of his ambitious ''Nomos No. 2'' for baritone solo, mixed choir and orchestra (1965). As his work with Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann developed, his engagement with the modern musical avantgarde decreased, but was never abandoned.\n\n==Mise \u00c9ire==\n\u00d3 Riada composed and directed orchestral music for theatre and film, combining [[Traditional Irish music|traditional Irish tunes]] and \"[[Sean-n\u00f3s song|sean-n\u00f3s]]\" (old style) songs in the classical tradition, similar to [[Musical nationalism|nationalist composers]] such as [[Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] (Czech), [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]] (Hungarian) and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] (English). In 1959 he scored a documentary film by [[George Morrison (documentary maker)|George Morrison]] called ''[[Mise \u00c9ire]]'' (\"I am Ireland\"), about the founding of the [[Irish Republic]]. The recording is conducted by \u00d3 Riada himself. ''Mise \u00c9ire'' brought him national acclaim and allowed him to start a series of programmes on Irish radio called ''Our Musical Heritage''. \u00d3 Riada told people that one should listen to [[sean-n\u00f3s song]] either as a child would listen or as if they were songs from [[India]].\n\n==Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann==\nBetween 1961 and 1969 \u00d3 Riada led the [[Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann]] group. They played in concert halls dressed in black suits with white shirts and black bow ties, but relied on traditional songs and tunes. An ordinary [[Music of Ireland Traditional music|c\u00e9ilidh band]] or show-band would have musicians who competed with each other to grab the audience's attention. Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann played sparse lucid arrangements. \u00d3 Riada sat in the middle at front playing a harpsichord and a [[bodhr\u00e1n]], a hand-held frame-drum. This was an instrument that had almost died out, being played only by small boys in street parades. Ceil\u00ed bands generally had jazz-band drum-kits. \u00d3 Riada also wanted to use the [[clarsach]] or wire-strung [[harp]] in the band, but as these were as yet unavailable, he played the [[harpsichord]] instead \u2013 in his opinion the nearest sound to a clarsach.<ref name=\"CooperDawe2005\">{{cite book|author1=David Cooper|author2=Kevin Dawe|title=The Mediterranean in Music: Critical Perspectives, Common Concerns, Cultural Differences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Di1KQc6-HCwC&pg=PA220|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-5407-9|pages=220\u2013}}</ref> The harpsichord he used on a regular basis was made by [[Cathal Gannon]]. Unknown to \u00d3 Riada, Irish folk music was being played ensemble-style in London pubs, but for most people of Ireland this was the first time they heard these tunes played by a band. For some, the membership of Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann overlapped with that of [[The Chieftains]]. They recorded the soundtrack of the film ''[[Playboy of the Western World]]'' (original play by [[John Millington Synge]]) in 1962. Their last public performance was in 1969, the album was then called \"\u00d3 Riada Sa Gaiety\".\n\n==Final years==\nIn 1963 \u00d3 Riada was appointed lecturer in music at [[University College, Cork]]. He moved to Ballyvourney, and not [[C\u00fail Aodha]] (a common misconception) in [[County Cork|West Cork]], an [[Gaeltacht|Irish-speaking area]], where he established [[C\u00f3r Ch\u00fail Aodha]], a male voice choir.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Biletz|first1=Frank A.|title=Historical Dictionary of Ireland|date=2013|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=0-8108-7091-6|page=326|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=rb8eAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA326#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref> He turned toward choral church music, composing two settings of the [[Mass (music)|Mass]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cox|first1=Gareth|title=Se\u00f3irse Bodley|date=2010|publisher=Field Day Publications|isbn=0-946755-48-5|page=114|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=bqsDoTw8ruAC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref> ''Ceol an Aifrinn'' (\"Music of the Mass\") was the first Mass written in the [[Irish language]].
