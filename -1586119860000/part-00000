of [[Murmansk Oblast]] in the far [[Far North (Russia)|northwest part]] of [[Russia]]. It sits on both slopes and banks of a modest [[ria]] or [[fjord]], [[Kola Bay]], an estuarine inlet of the [[Barents Sea]]. Its bulk is on the east bank of the inlet. It is in the north of the rounded [[Kola Peninsula]] which covers most of the oblast (semi-autonomous region). The city is {{convert|108|km}} from [[Norway\u2013Russia border|the border with Norway]] and {{convert|182|km}} from [[Finnish\u2013Russian border|the Finnish border]]. The city is named for the [[Murman Coast]], an archaic term in [[Russian language|Russian]] for Norway.\n\nBenefitting from the [[North Atlantic Current]], Murmansk resembles cities of its size across western Russia, with highway and railway access to the rest of Europe, and the northernmost [[trolleybus]] system on Earth. It lies over 2\u00b0 north of the [[Arctic Circle]].  Its connectivity contrasts to the isolation of Arctic ports like the [[Siberia|Siberian]] [[Dikson (urban-type settlement)|Dikson]] on the shores of the [[Kara Sea]] and [[Iqaluit]], [[Nunavut]] in [[Canada]] on [[Baffin Island]]'s [[Frobisher Bay]] off the [[Labrador Sea]].

The earliest documentary evidence for the name was in 1180, when a clergyman named Burkhard made transactions with wealthy residents.\n\nAt that time Muri belonged to the dominion of Geristein, which in 1298 was conquered by the city of [[Bern]]. The holdings consisted of the four so-called parishes [[Bolligen]], Muri, [[Stettlen]], and [[Vechigen]]. As the emerging Bern conquered the territories, it left the municipalities untouched, beginning the long-standing tradition of municipal autonomy.\n\nIn the course of the centuries the residents of the municipality lived in relative stability, in which the major changes in European and Swiss history seemed to pass them by. Major structural and commercial changes began to take place in the beginning of the 20th century. It followed [[industrialization]] and the trains from the city to the countryside. In the decade between 1920 and 1930, the municipal population grew from 2435 to 3938, or 62%.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:G\u00fcmligen Panorama.JPG|thumb|left|400px|Panorama around G\u00fcmligen]]\nMuri bei Bern has an area of {{Swiss area|0356|mi=on}}.{{Swiss area data|0356|QUELLE}}<!--7.63 - 7.65 km2-->  Of this area, {{convert|2|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} or 26.2% is used for agricultural purposes, while {{convert|1.67|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} or 21.9% is forested.

The earliest documentary evidence for the name was in 1180, when a clergyman named Burkhard made transactions with wealthy residents.\n\nAt that time Muri belonged to the dominion of Geristein, which in 1298 was conquered by the city of [[Bern]]. The holdings consisted of the four so-called parishes [[Bolligen]], Muri, [[Stettlen]], and [[Vechigen]]. As the emerging Bern conquered the territories, it left the municipalities untouched, beginning the long-standing tradition of municipal autonomy.\n\nIn the course of the centuries the residents of the municipality lived in relative stability, in which the major changes in European and Swiss history seemed to pass them by. Major structural and commercial changes began to take place in the beginning of the 20th century. It followed [[industrialization]] and the trains from the city to the countryside.

'''Sensory memory''' ('''SM''') allows individuals to retain impressions of sensory information after the original stimulus has ceased.<ref name=\"Coltheart\" /> A common demonstration of SM is a child's ability to write letters and make circles by twirling a sparkler at night.  When the sparkler is spun fast enough, it appears to leave a trail which forms a continuous image.  This \"light trail\" is the image that is  represented in the visual sensory store known as [[iconic memory]].  The other two types of SM that have been most extensively studied are [[echoic memory]], and [[haptic memory]]; however, it is reasonable to assume that each physiological sense has a corresponding memory store.  Children for example have been shown to remember specific \"sweet\" tastes during [[latent learning|incidental learning]] trials but the nature of this gustatory store is still unclear.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Laureati|first=M.|author2=E.

Iconic memory was the first sensory store to be investigated with experiments dating back as far as 1740. One of the earliest investigations into this phenomenon was by J\u00e1n Andrej Segner, a German physicist and mathematician. In his experiment, Segner attached a glowing coal to a cart wheel and rotated the wheel at increasing speed until an unbroken circle of light was perceived by the observer. He calculated that the glowing coal needed to make a complete circle in under 100ms to achieve this effect, which he determined was the duration of this visual memory store. In 1960, George Sperling conducted a study where participants were shown a set of letters for a brief amount of time and were asked to recall the letters they were shown afterwards.  Participants were less likely to recall more letters when asked about the whole group of letters, but recalled more when asked about specific subgroups of the whole.  These findings suggest that iconic memory in humans has a large capacity, but decays very rapidly <ref> Sperling, G. (1960). The information available in brief visual presentations. Psychological Monographs: General and Applied, 74(11), 1-29. {{doi|10.1037/h0093759}} </ref>. Another study set out to test the idea that visual sensory memory consists of coarse-grained and fine-grained memory traces using a mathematical model to quantify each.  The study suggested that the dual-trace model of visual memory out performed single-trace models <ref> Cappiello, M., & Zhang, W. (2016). A dual-trace model for visual sensory memory.

When the sparkler is spun fast enough, it appears to leave a trail which forms a continuous image.  This \"light trail\" is the image that is  represented in the visual sensory store known as [[iconic memory]].

The information represented in SM is the \"raw data\" which provides a snapshot of a person's overall sensory experience. Common features between each [[sensory modality]] have been identified; however, as experimental techniques advance, exceptions and additions to these general characteristics will surely evolve.

Iconic memory was the first sensory store to be investigated with experiments dating back as far as 1740. One of the earliest investigations into this phenomenon was by J\u00e1n Andrej Segner, a German physicist and mathematician. In his experiment, Segner attached a glowing coal to a cart wheel and rotated the wheel at increasing speed until an unbroken circle of light was perceived by the observer. He calculated that the glowing coal needed to make a complete circle in under 100ms to achieve this effect, which he determined was the duration of this visual memory store. In 1960, George Sperling conducted a study where participants were shown a set of letters for a brief amount of time and were asked to recall the letters they were shown afterwards.  Participants were less likely to recall more letters when asked about the whole group of letters, but recalled more when asked about specific subgroups of the whole.  These findings suggest that iconic memory in humans has a large capacity, but decays very rapidly <ref> Sperling, G. (1960). The information available in brief visual presentations. Psychological Monographs: General and Applied, 74(11), 1-29. {{doi|10.1037/h0093759}} </ref>. Another study set out to test the idea that visual sensory memory consists of coarse-grained and fine-grained memory traces using a mathematical model to quantify each.  The study suggested that the dual-trace model of visual memory out performed single-trace models <ref> Cappiello, M., & Zhang, W. (2016). A dual-trace model for visual sensory memory.

{"title_page": "History of municipal treatment of drinking water", "text_new": "{{more footnotes|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe development of [[water treatment]] and [[filtration]] technologies went through many stages. The greatest level of change came in the 19th century as growth of cities forced new methods of distributing and treating water in cities and the problems of water contamination became more pronounced.\n\n==Pre-19th-century water treatment==\nSushruta of India recommended to boil and heat water under the sun and filtering with gravel and charcoal prior to drinking.  ([[Sushruta Samhita]], Arabic translation Kitab-i-Susrud).  Early water treatment was primarily focused on the aesthetic properties of water, taste and odor. Writings from [[ancient Greece]] indicate that boiling and filtering water through [[charcoal]] were used along with exposing the water to sunlight and straining. Other cultures such as the Egyptians were using [[alum]] as a means of removing suspended particles by 1500 B.C.<ref name=\"epa\">http://www.epa.gov/ogwdw/consumer/pdf/hist.pdf</ref> Medieval [[Venice]] obtained filtered water from [[cisterns]] using beds of sand.<ref>Melosi, 85.</ref>\n\nThroughout most of human history the primary means of acquiring untainted water was to avoid the problem and bring in water from an outside source that did not require treatment. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] did this with their [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]]. [[London]]'s New River was constructed, beginning in the early 17th century as a means of bringing in clean water from outside the city. The New River was slow flowing, which helped to increase sedimentation. It also had screens installed every few miles to catch any debris and weeds. These screens required periodic maintenance and workmen were employed to clean them and cut back the weeds.<ref>Halliday, 16\u201317.</ref> The new river would meet London's needs well enough that there were few complaints before the 19th century, although the water supplied was rarely used for drinking directly, rather it was more likely used for washing or the brewing of beer.<ref>Hardy, 252.</ref>\n\n==The Growing need for Filtration and Treatment.==\n\nBy the beginning of the 19th century filtration became a means of removing debris from the water. [[Paisley, Scotland,]] became the first city to use a filter, designed by John Gibb, to supply a city with water.<ref>Blake, 258.</ref> London would follow up on [[Scotland]]'s initial filter with one of its own at [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] in 1828. The Chelsea filter was a [[slow sand filter]] which consisted of a two-foot layer of sand with layers of shells gravel and bricks beneath. The Chelsea filter was capable of clearing 95 percent of impurities from the water. It was unknown at the time of its construction but this filter also functioned as biological filter due to bacteria present in the bed.<ref>Halliday, 19.</ref>  The [[Bacteriology]] of cities waste water would not be understood until the end of the 19th century.\n\nThe benefits of filtration were not obvious at the time and adoption of filters was slow. [[Berlin]] would install filters in 1856 and other European cities would follow. In America the need for filtration was not readily apparent. The city of [[Richmond, Virginia]] attempted to install a slow sand filter in 1832 but the filter did not operate properly. Other American cities considered installing filters but deemed them too expensive at the time.<ref>Melosi, 86.</ref>\n\n==Increased Contamination of Water.==\n\nA tipping point came in the early 19th century that required attention to be paid to water treatment. The [[water closet]] ([[toilet]]), an improved version of which was introduced by John Bramah in the 1770s began to grow in popularity. By the 1830s the water closet was widely used in London. Household drains could not be connected to the city's sewers, but after 1815 this prohibition was lifted. Water closets could now empty into the cities sewer which in turn emptied into the [[Thames]].<ref>Hardy 262\u2013263.</ref> This was a disaster for the river. In 1816 salmon could be caught in the Thames, four years later none could be caught. The water closet overloaded the medieval [[cesspool]] system which was still in use. The use of water to dispose of sewage in the water closets filed the cesspools ten to twenty times quicker. Cesspools before this had received mostly solid waste. The rapid filling caused seepage. By 1844 the Metropolitan Buildings act simply required new buildings to be connected to street sewers.<ref>Halliday 131\u2013133.</ref> The tidal nature of the Thames did not help the matter.\n\nA similar situation was occurring in the US. Water consumption was increasing, for example in [[Chicago]] the per capita water consumption was 33 gallons per day in 1856 to 144 gallons in 1882 (although this figure also includes industrial sources). This increased water consumption and the growing use of water closets overloaded the existing cesspool system and served to contaminate the surrounding soil and watercourses.<ref>Tarr, 231\u2013233.</ref>\n\n==Disease==\n\nAn increase in the awareness of the transmission of diseases such as [[cholera]], [[typhoid]] and [[yellow fever]] in the 19th century manifested in a growing need to filter and treat municipal drinking water. The growth of cities and the contamination of nearby water sources by sewage and industrial waste led to an increasing demand for treatment.\n\nThe understanding of how disease was transmitted was still developing. The [[miasmatic theory]] advocated that disease was transmitted by smell and foul odors arising from putrefaction of organic matter. This was advocated by early sanitarian [[Edwin Chadwick]], who in the 1840s, advocated the removal of human waste by means of water, the idea was to remove the foul smells as quickly as possible, by means of water ideally to be deposited on agricultural fields.<ref>Melosi, 47\u201348.</ref> The sewage was instead deposited in the Thames of which many water suppliers still used as their source. In this environment [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] established a series of experiments where he was able to show that cholera was communicable by water and was able to link a cholera outbreak in London to a single well in London on Broad Street.<ref>Melosi 55.</ref> The link between water and disease was still not well established and in 1873 the president of the New York board of health declared that \"although rivers are great natural sewers, and receive the drainage of towns and cities the natural process of purification, in most cases destroys the offensive bodies derived from sewer and renders them harmless\".<ref>Melosi 85.</ref> This is typical of the lack of understanding of how disease was transmitted and followed the general belief that water courses such as rivers and lakes were great sinks for purification of contaminated water.\n\n[[File:\"Interior of treating and filtration plant, Boulder City water supply.

Rapid sand filters and controls on the left.\" [[National Archives]], 293652]]\n\nAs understanding of the bacteriological nature of disease became clearer in the late 19th century the need to filter and treat water became apparent. In [[Lowell, MA]] after a typhoid outbreak in 1890 [[William Thompson Sedgwick]] applied bacteriological methods to the investigation and was able to establish a link between contaminated water and the disease. The United States by this time had begun to introduce filtration into its municipal water supplies as a means of removing sediment form water in the 1870s through 90s. The United States also introduced the [[rapid sand filter]] which were a derivation of filters used in the paper making industry. The rapid filters and the slow sand filters engaged in competition as to which technology was superior. By the beginning of the 20th century, an increased knowledge in bacteriology led to improvements in the slow sand filters as well as the design of rapid filters. It soon became apparent that slow sand filters could remove typhoid germs.<ref>Melosi 138\u2013142.</ref>\n\nTreatment as well as filtration began to be used in the early 20th century. [[Water chlorination]] as a means of treatment began to be used in the late 19th century. [[Bleaching powder]] was the first material used for chlorination. [[Middelkerke, Belgium]], would become the first city to chlorinate its water, in 1902, and [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], became the first in city in the United States to do so, in 1909. Filtration alone was coincidentally able to prevent many cases of typhoid, although filtration's primary purpose was reducing turbidity of the water.<ref>Melosi 143\u2013145.</ref> General concern about doping the water with chemicals led to some debate on the merits of chlorination. On January 14, 1916, the chlorination equipment in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], ceased functioning for 7 hours. In that time the water pumped from [[Lake Michigan]] caused 25,000 to 100,000 cases of diarrhea as well as 500 cases of typhoid fever, with 60 deaths.<ref>Foss-Molan, 90.</ref>  By this point the need for treatment was becoming clear.\n\n==Regulation in the United States.==\n\nDrinking water regulations were enacted by the US federal government beginning in 1914 regarding the bacteriological quality of drinking water. This regulation would later be strengthened as it became apparent in the 1960s that industrial process was contaminating the water. Techniques such as [[aeration]], [[flocculation]], and granular activated carbon absorption could combat this and these techniques were known but were not universally utilized in United States water supplies. Regulation was passed in the 1974 Safe Drinking water act to address some of these deficiencies.<ref name=\"epa\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of water supply and sanitation]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n*Blake, Nelson Manfred.
