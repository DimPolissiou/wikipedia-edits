PAOK had to relocate and a 7.5 acres area, owned by the [[Ministry of National Defence (Greece)|Ministry of National Defence]] at [[Toumba (Thessaloniki)|Toumba district]] was chosen as the adequate location. The purchase cost was set at 1.5 million [[drachmas]] and was paid by PAOK administration in 20 six-month instalments of 75,000 drachmas each. On 7 February 1958, a committee of [[NRDC-GR|III Army Corps]] officers delivered the land to PAOK representatives.\n\nThere were still barracks on the premises, housing victims of the [[Greek Civil War]] and the [[1953 Ionian earthquake]]. Relocating all these people cost the club 70,000 drachmas. The total cost of the stadium's construction amounted to 6 million drachmas, with just 1.1&nbsp;million coming from the General Secretariat of Sports as subvention. In spring of 1958 construction work started, based on the plans of architect Minas Trempelas and civil engineer Antonis Triglianos. In an attempt to collect the necessary funds, the club issued the \"Lottery for the construction of PAOK New Stadium\" in April 1958 at a cost of 20 drachmas each. Since 1956, the administration was withholding 15% of the gate income in order to fund the construction of the new stadium. Many PAOK fans, apart from money, also contributed to construction by volunteering to work as builders. The construction of the stadium was completed at a record time of one year.\n\nThe inauguration event was scheduled for Sunday 6 September 1959 with a friendly encounter against [[AEK FC]] (PAOK prevailed 1\u20130 with a goal by Kostas Kiourtzis). Prime minister [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]]'s attendance was cancelled at the last minute. However, several ministers of his government were there for the occasion. As for the ball for the first kick-off, it fell at 17:30 off an airplane of Sedes Military Air Base.

PAOK had to relocate and a 7.5 acres area, owned by the [[Ministry of National Defence (Greece)|Ministry of National Defence]] at [[Toumba (Thessaloniki)|Toumba district]] was chosen as the adequate location. The purchase cost was set at 1.5 million [[drachmas]] and was paid by PAOK administration in 20 six-month instalments of 75,000 drachmas each. On 7 February 1958, a committee of [[NRDC-GR|III Army Corps]] officers delivered the land to PAOK representatives.\n\nThere were still barracks on the premises, housing victims of the [[Greek Civil War]] and the [[1953 Ionian earthquake]]. Relocating all these people cost the club 70,000 drachmas. The total cost of the stadium's construction amounted to 6 million drachmas, with just 1.1&nbsp;million coming from the General Secretariat of Sports as subvention. In spring of 1958 construction work started, based on the plans of architect Minas Trempelas and civil engineer Antonis Triglianos. In an attempt to collect the necessary funds, the club issued the \"Lottery for the construction of PAOK New Stadium\" in April 1958 at a cost of 20 drachmas each. Since 1956, the administration was withholding 15% of the gate income in order to fund the construction of the new stadium. Many PAOK fans, apart from money, also contributed to construction by volunteering to work as builders. The construction of the stadium was completed at a record time of one year.\n\nThe inauguration event was scheduled for Sunday 6 September 1959 with a friendly encounter against [[AEK FC]] (PAOK prevailed 1\u20130 with a goal by Kostas Kiourtzis). Prime minister [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]]'s attendance was cancelled at the last minute. However, several ministers of his government were there for the occasion.

The Prep League allows 13-year-old players to make the transition to the regulation size diamond, while competing with peers their own age.\n\nIn 1982, Babe Ruth Baseball added yet another division to its program, the Bambino division for players ages 4\u201312.\n\nIn 1984, Babe Ruth League, Inc. added another dimension to its program \u2014 Babe Ruth Softball. The Softball Division encompasses players 4 to 18 years of age. The program was organized because Babe Ruth League, Inc. saw a need for a quality national softball program. The softball program was designed to focus on all ability levels of young female athletes, providing them with the same enriching athletic experience as the baseball divisions.\n\nJuly 6, 1999 was the beginning of a new era for Babe Ruth League, Inc. The Bambino Division was renamed \u201cCal Ripken Baseball, a Division of Babe Ruth League, Inc.\u201d [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]]\u2019s visions and philosophies, molded by his father, [[Cal Ripken, Sr.]], directly parallel those of Babe Ruth League, Inc. Now, two of the most prolific legends and heroes in baseball, inspire in our youth participants their knowledge, spirit and pure passion for the game.\n\nIn 2000 the Buddy-Ball Division for players ages 5-20 who are physically and/or mentally challenged was renamed the Bambino BuddyBall Division. A \u201cbuddy\u201d helps the player swing a bat, round the bases, catch a ball.\n\n2013 saw the addition of Xtreme Fastpitch to accommodate all softball participants\u2014those who wish to play on a recreational level to those who seek a higher degree of competition to hone their skills with the goal of continuing play into high school and beyond.\n\n== Divisions ==\n\n=== Cal Ripken Baseball (Formerly Known As Bambino Division) ===\n[[File:Cal Ripken Baseball logo.svg|thumb|right|Logo for Cal Ripken BAseball - A Division of Babe Ruth League, Inc.]]\n\n==== Major/70 ====\n\nFeatures a 50' pitching distance and 70' base paths, this division is offered as an option to the major division format, and includes a tournament trail from District competition through the World Series in [[Branson, Missouri]] featuring eight International Champions.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Cal Ripken Baseball - A Division of Babe Ruth League, Inc.|url = http://www.baberuthleague.org/cal-ripken-baseball.aspx|website = Babe Ruth League, Inc.|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}</ref>\n\n==== Major/60 ====\nFeatures a 46' pitching distance and 60' base paths. Special base running rules are also in effect. This division is offered as an option to the major division format, and includes a tournament trail from District competition through the World Series.\n\n==== Minors ====\nRecommended for ballplayers ages 9\u201310. Players build and refine their fundamental skills while beginning to understand game strategy and teamwork. In most regions, participants first experience post-season tournament competition in this level, leading to the 10 Year-Old World Series.\n\n==== Rookie ====\nDesigned primarily for ballplayers ages 7\u20138, this division makes use of a pitching machine to allow for more hittable balls at the plate and more action in the field. Fear of actually being hit by a pitched ball is diminished. It makes the game safer and improves the playing confidence and ability of all participants.\n\n==== T-Ball ====\nBallplayers ages 4\u20136 learn hitting and fielding fundamentals in a supportive team environment. Young athletes hit the ball from a batting tee which is height-adjusted for a level swing, batting in order through the line-up for the entire game. The primary goal is to begin to instruct young players in the fundamentals of baseball in a supportive team environment.\n\n=== Babe Ruth Baseball ===\n==== 13-15 ====\nAlso known as Senior Babe Ruth Baseball, Babe Ruth Baseball was created for ballplayers ages 13\u201315 who wished to continue their baseball playing experience beyond the age of 12. This is where players get their baseball cleats muddy for the first time on standard 90' diamonds under Official Baseball Rules used by Major League Baseball. In this division, teams are eligible to enter tournament competition and move along the tournament trail, culminating in a World Series. Three World Series are held in this division: one for 13 Year-Old players, one for 13 and 14 Year-Old Players, and the renowned 13-15 World Series.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Babe Ruth Baseball|url = http://www.baberuthleague.org/babe-ruth-baseball.aspx|website = Babe Ruth League, Inc.|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}</ref> In 2019, the 13-15 World Series was held in Bismarck, ND and was attended by several former participants from the 1969 winning team, including [[Baltimore Orioles]] legend [[Scott McGregor (baseball)|Scott MacGregor]]\n\n==== 13 Year-Old Prep ====\nPlayers often express a fear of competing with 14 and 15 Year-Old players who have already experienced one or two years playing on a standard 90' diamond. Babe Ruth League introduced this prep league - comprising teams with only 13-year-old players-to foster more participation in the game for this age group. This league offers the 13-year-old player the assurance to play without age intimidation and the chance to participate in the 13-Year-Old World Series.\n\n==== 16-18 ====\nThe highest and most accomplished level in Babe Ruth Baseball. A favorite among high school players and coaches, this division prepares players for collegiate recruiting and the professional draft. This division allows players a chance to compete through a tournament trail to reach the 16-18 Year-Old World Series.\n\n==== 16 Year-Old Prep ====\n[[File:Babe Ruth Softball logo.svg|thumb|right|Logo for Babe Ruth Softball]]The primary objective of the 16-Year-Old Prep program is to provide players the opportunity to stay involved in organized baseball while sharpening their skills against competition in their own age group.

The primary emphasis of Babe Ruth Softball is on education, skill development, participation for all levels of ability and of course, having fun.\n\nA special highlight of Babe Ruth Softball is its annual tournament trail. Tournament teams from each local league are eligible to participate in District competition with winners advancing to the State and Regional levels. Entry to the official Babe Ruth Softball tournament trail is free. 12 & Under and 16 & Under Divisions advance to a World Series. Babe Ruth Softball also offers an invitational World Series for the 8 & Under, 10 & Under, and 14 & Under divisions.[[File:Bambino Buddy-Ball logo.svg|thumb|left|Logo for Bambino Buddy Ball]]\n\n=== Bambino Buddy-Ball ===\nThe Bambino Buddy-Ball Division was established for organizations who wish to charter a league that encompasses players ages 5\u201320 who are either physically and/or mentally challenged.

The Prep League allows 13-year-old players to make the transition to the regulation size diamond, while competing with peers their own age.\n\nIn 1982, Babe Ruth Baseball added yet another division to its program, the Bambino division for players ages 4\u201312.\n\nIn 1984, Babe Ruth League, Inc. added another dimension to its program \u2014 Babe Ruth Softball. The Softball Division encompasses players 4 to 18 years of age. The program was organized because Babe Ruth League, Inc. saw a need for a quality national softball program. The softball program was designed to focus on all ability levels of young female athletes, providing them with the same enriching athletic experience as the baseball divisions.\n\nJuly 6, 1999 was the beginning of a new era for Babe Ruth League, Inc.

Special base running rules are also in effect. This division is offered as an option to the major division format, and includes a tournament trail from District competition through the World Series.\n\n==== Minors ====\nRecommended for ballplayers ages 9\u201310. Players build and refine their fundamental skills while beginning to understand game strategy and teamwork. In most regions, participants first experience post-season tournament competition in this level, leading to the 10 Year-Old World Series.\n\n==== Rookie ====\nDesigned primarily for ballplayers ages 7\u20138, this division makes use of a pitching machine to allow for more hittable balls at the plate and more action in the field. Fear of actually being hit by a pitched ball is diminished. It makes the game safer and improves the playing confidence and ability of all participants.\n\n==== T-Ball ====\nBallplayers ages 4\u20136 learn hitting and fielding fundamentals in a supportive team environment. Young athletes hit the ball from a batting tee which is height-adjusted for a level swing, batting in order through the line-up for the entire game. The primary goal is to begin to instruct young players in the fundamentals of baseball in a supportive team environment.\n\n=== Babe Ruth Baseball ===\n==== 13-15 ====\nAlso known as Senior Babe Ruth Baseball, Babe Ruth Baseball was created for ballplayers ages 13\u201315 who wished to continue their baseball playing experience beyond the age of 12. This is where players get their baseball cleats muddy for the first time on standard 90' diamonds under Official Baseball Rules used by Major League Baseball. In this division, teams are eligible to enter tournament competition and move along the tournament trail, culminating in a World Series. Three World Series are held in this division: one for 13 Year-Old players, one for 13 and 14 Year-Old Players, and the renowned 13-15 World Series.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Babe Ruth Baseball|url = http://www.baberuthleague.org/babe-ruth-baseball.aspx|website = Babe Ruth League, Inc.|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}</ref> In 2019, the 13-15 World Series was held in Bismarck, ND and was attended by several former participants from the 1969 winning team, including [[Baltimore Orioles]] legend [[Scott McGregor (baseball)|Scott MacGregor]]\n\n==== 13 Year-Old Prep ====\nPlayers often express a fear of competing with 14 and 15 Year-Old players who have already experienced one or two years playing on a standard 90' diamond. Babe Ruth League introduced this prep league - comprising teams with only 13-year-old players-to foster more participation in the game for this age group. This league offers the 13-year-old player the assurance to play without age intimidation and the chance to participate in the 13-Year-Old World Series.\n\n==== 16-18 ====\nThe highest and most accomplished level in Babe Ruth Baseball. A favorite among high school players and coaches, this division prepares players for collegiate recruiting and the professional draft.

Later, the [[Spain|Spanish]] shipped the native Lucayans to slavery on [[Hispaniola]], after which the Bahama islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648, when [[Kingdom of England|English]] colonists from [[Bermuda]] settled on the island of [[Eleuthera]].\n\nThe Bahamas became a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[crown colony]] in 1718, when the British clamped down on [[piracy]]. After the [[American Revolutionary War]], the Crown resettled thousands of [[American Loyalists]] to The Bahamas; they took their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants. African slaves and their descendants constituted the majority of the population from this period on. The slave trade was abolished by the British in 1807; slavery in The Bahamas was abolished in 1834. Subsequently, The Bahamas became a haven for freed African slaves. Africans liberated from illegal slave ships were resettled on the islands by the [[Royal Navy]], while some [[Slavery in North America|North American slaves]] and [[Seminole]]s escaped to The Bahamas from Florida. Bahamians were even known to recognise the freedom of slaves carried by the ships of other nations which reached The Bahamas.

Whilst there is a general consensus that this island lay within The Bahamas, precisely which island Columbus landed on is a matter of scholarly debate. Some researchers believe the site to be present-day [[San Salvador Island]] (formerly known as Watling's Island), situated in the southeastern Bahamas, whilst an alternative theory holds that Columbus landed to the southeast on [[Samana Cay]], according to calculations made in 1986 by ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' writer and editor [[Joseph Judge]], based on Columbus's log. On the landfall island, Columbus made first contact with the Lucayans and exchanged goods with them, claiming the islands for the [[Crown of Castile]], before proceeding to explore the larger isles of the [[Greater Antilles]].<ref name=\"Britannica, Bahamas\"/>\n\nThe 1494 [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] theoretically divided the new territories between the [[Kingdom of Castile]] and the [[Kingdom of Portugal]], placing The Bahamas in the Spanish sphere; however they did little to press their claim on the ground.

After the [[American Revolutionary War]], the Crown resettled thousands of [[American Loyalists]] to The Bahamas; they took their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants. African slaves and their descendants constituted the majority of the population from this period on. The slave trade was abolished by the British in 1807; slavery in The Bahamas was abolished in 1834. Subsequently, The Bahamas became a haven for freed African slaves. Africans liberated from illegal slave ships were resettled on the islands by the [[Royal Navy]], while some [[Slavery in North America|North American slaves]] and [[Seminole]]s escaped to The Bahamas from Florida. Bahamians were even known to recognise the freedom of slaves carried by the ships of other nations which reached The Bahamas.

Whilst there is a general consensus that this island lay within The Bahamas, precisely which island Columbus landed on is a matter of scholarly debate. Some researchers believe the site to be present-day [[San Salvador Island]] (formerly known as Watling's Island), situated in the southeastern Bahamas, whilst an alternative theory holds that Columbus landed to the southeast on [[Samana Cay]], according to calculations made in 1986 by ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' writer and editor [[Joseph Judge]], based on Columbus's log. On the landfall island, Columbus made first contact with the Lucayans and exchanged goods with them, claiming the islands for the [[Crown of Castile]], before proceeding to explore the larger isles of the [[Greater Antilles]].<ref name=\"Britannica, Bahamas\"/>\n\nThe 1494 [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] theoretically divided the new territories between the [[Kingdom of Castile]] and the [[Kingdom of Portugal]], placing The Bahamas in the Spanish sphere; however they did little to press their claim on the ground.

In 1590, construction began on the [[Fort of Pessegueiro Island]], which came to occupy a dominant position on the island, with the purpose of providing military support to a [[:pt:Forte de Nossa Senhora da Queimada|fort]] on the mainland.

The pirates killed the monk, looted the chapel and threw her statue into the flames.\n\nLater the inhabitants of Porto Covo buried the Christian hermit, but could not, at first, find the sacred image. Deciding to search the entire island, they finally found the statue within a burned bush but unharmed by the fire: the image became known as the ''Queimada'' (''Burnt Virgin''). The statue was removed to the mainland, one kilometre from the island, where a new chapel was built, known as the ''Chapel of the Burned Virgin'' ({{lang-pt|Capela de Nossa Senhora da Queimada|links=no}}), becoming a destination for pilgrimages.\n\n==Geography==\nLocated {{convert|300|m|yd}} from the coast by a channel, it is situated south of the parish seat of Porto Covo, southwest of a small inlet used by fishing boats.<ref>{{cite enroute|143|2017|163}}</ref>\n\nPart of the [[Southwest Alentejo and Vicentine Coast Natural Park]] it is migratory stop and hatchery for many marine bird species, some on the verge of extinction, including [[seagulls]], [[cormorant]]s and [[carrion crow]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sines.pt/PT/Concelho/patrimonionatural/ilhadopessegueiro/Paginas/default.aspx |publisher=C\u00e2mara Municipal de Sines |location=Sines, Portugal |language=Portuguese |year=2011 |accessdate=14 January 2012 |title=Ilha do Pessegueiro |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127052626/http://www.sines.pt/PT/Concelho/patrimonionatural/ilhadopessegueiro/Paginas/default.aspx |archivedate=27 January 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Uninhabited islands of Portugal]]\n[[Category:Former populated places in Portugal]]\n[[Category:Sines]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|island in Portugal}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name                    = Pessegueiro Island\n| native_name             = Ilha Pessegueiro\n| other_name              = \n| settlement_type         = Island\n<!-- images, nickname, motto -->\n| image_skyline           = Porto Covo January 2011-2b.jpg\n| image_caption           = The island of Pessegueiro as seen from the village of Porto Covo, during a winter storm\n| image_flag              = \n| image_shield            = \n| motto                   = \n| nickname                = \n| etymology               = ''pessegueiro'', Portuguese word for ''[[peach]]tree''; literally ''\"island of the peachtree\"''\n<!-- location -->\n| subdivision_type        = Country\n| subdivision_name        = {{flag|Portugal}}\n| subdivision_type1       = Region\n| subdivision_name1       = [[Alentejo]]\n| subdivision_type2       = Subregion\n| subdivision_name2       = [[Alentejo Litoral]]\n| subdivision_type3       = \n| subdivision_name3       = \n| subdivision_type4       = \n| subdivision_name4       = \n| parts_type              = Municipality\n| parts_style             = para\n| p1                      = [[Sines Municipality|Sines]]\n<!-- maps and coordinates -->\n| image_map               = \n| map_caption             = Location of the island of Pessegueiro in continental Portugal\n| pushpin_map             = \n| pushpin_relief          = \n| pushpin_map_caption     =  \n| coordinates             = \n| coordinates_footnotes   = \n<!-- established -->\n| established_title       = \n| established_date        = \n<!-- area -->\n| area_footnotes          = \n| area_total_km2          = \n| area_total_sq_mi        = \n| area_land_sq_mi         = \n| area_water_sq_mi        = \n<!-- elevation -->\n| elevation_footnotes     = \n| elevation_m             = \n| elevation_ft            = \n<!-- population -->\n| population_as_of        = \n| population_footnotes    = \n| population_total        = \n| population_density_km2  = auto\n| population_density_sq_mi=\n| population_demonym      = \n<!-- time zone(s) -->\n| timezone1               = \n| utc_offset1             = \n| timezone1_DST           = \n| utc_offset1_DST         = \n<!-- postal codes, area code -->\n| postal_code_type        = \n| postal_code             = \n| area_code_type          =  \n| area_code               = \n| geocode                 = \n| iso_code                = \n| blank_name             = Ethnic groups\n| blank_info             = Portuguese\n<!-- website, footnotes -->\n| website                 = \n| footnotes               = Statistics from [[Instituto Nacional de Estat\u00edstica|INE]] (2001); geographic detail from Instituto Geogr\u00e1fico Portugu\u00eas (2010)\n}} \n'''Pessegueiro Island''' ({{lang-pt|Ilha do Pessegueiro|links=no}}), literally ''island of the Peachtree'', is a small island/islet located along the southwest coast of the civil parish of [[Porto Covo]] in the municipality of [[Sines Municipality|Sines]].
