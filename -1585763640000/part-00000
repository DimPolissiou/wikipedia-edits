Griboyedov had played a pivotal role in the ratification of the latter treaty.\n\n==Early life==\nGriboyedov was born in [[Moscow]], the exact year unknown, with biographers debating whether it was in 1790 or 1795. Griboyedov received a Masters in [[philology]] from [[Moscow State University|Moscow University]], and subsequently enrolled in the doctorate program. In 1812, he quit the program and enrolled in the military.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Woe from Wit|last=Griboyedov|first=Alexander|publisher=Russian Life Books|year=2017|isbn=978-1-880100-52-3|location=Montpelier, VT|pages=6\u20137}}</ref> He obtained a commission in a [[hussar]] [[regiment]], which he resigned in 1816. The next year, he entered the [[civil service]]. In 1818 he was appointed secretary of the Russian [[legation]] in [[Persia]], and transferred to [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Griboyedov, Alexander Sergueevich|volume=12|page=593}}</ref>\n\nHis [[Poetry|verse]] comedy ''The Young Spouses'' ({{lang-ru|\u041c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0438}}, ''Molodye Suprugi''), which he staged in [[St. Petersburg]] in 1816, was followed by other similar works. Neither these nor his [[essay]]s and poetry would have been long remembered but for the success of his verse comedy ''[[Woe from Wit]]'' ({{lang-ru|\u0413\u043e\u0440\u0435 \u043e\u0442 \u0443\u043c\u0430}}, ''Gore ot Uma''), a [[satire]] on Russian [[aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] society.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nAs a high official in the play puts it, this work is \"a [[pasquinade]] on Moscow\". The play depicts certain social and official stereotypes in the characters of Famusov, who hates reform; his secretary, Molchalin, who fawns over officials; and the aristocratic young liberal and [[Anglomania]]c, Repetilov. By contrast the hero of the piece, Chatsky, an ironic satirist just returned from western Europe, exposes and ridicules the weaknesses of the rest. His words echo the outcry of the young generation in the lead-up to the [[Decembrist|armed insurrection of 1825]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIn [[Russia]] for the summer of 1823, Griboyedov completed the play and took it to St. Petersburg. It was rejected by the [[censorship|censors]].

Soon after Griboyedov's arrival in [[Tehran]], a mob stormed the [[Embassy of Russia in Tehran|Russian embassy]].\n\nThe incident began when an [[Armenians|Armenian]] [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]] escaped from the [[harem]] of the Persian [[Fath Ali Shah|shah]], and at the same time two enslaved Armenian women escaped from the harem of the Shah's son-in-law. All three sought refuge at the Russian legation. As agreed in the [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]], Georgians and Armenians living in Persia at that time were permitted to return to Georgia and [[Eastern Armenia]].<ref name=\"Hopkirk p. 122\">[[Peter Hopkirk|Hopkirk, Peter]].

His decision caused an uproar throughout the city and several thousand Persians encircled the Russian compound demanding their release.\n\nWhen Griboyedov decided to return the escaped eunuch and two Armenian women, it was too late. Soon after, urged on by the mullahs, the mob stormed the building. A high-ranking Muslim scholar with the title of Mojtahed, Mirza Masih Astarabadi known as Mirza Masih Mojtahed, issued a fatwa saying that freeing Muslim women from the claws of unbelievers is allowed.<ref name=Hopkirk>{{cite book |title=The Great Game |last=Hopkirk |first=Peter |year=2006 |publisher=John Murray |location=London |isbn=978-0-7195-6447-5 |page=113}}</ref>\n\nGriboyedov and other members of his mission had prepared for a siege and sealed all the windows and doors. Armed and in full uniform, they were resolved to defend to the last drop of blood. Although small in number, the [[Cossack]] detachment assigned to protect the legation held off the mob for over an hour until finally being driven back to Griboyedov's office. There, Griboyedov and the Cossacks resisted until the mob broke through the roof of the building, and then through the ceiling, to slaughter them.

It was eventually abandoned on a garbage heap after three days of ill-treatment by the mob, such that in the end it could be identified only by a duelling injury to a finger. The following June, Griboyedov's friend [[Alexander Pushkin]], travelling through the southern Caucasus, encountered some men from Tehran leading an oxcart. The men told Pushkin they were conveying the ambassador's remains to Tiflis (now [[Tbilisi]]).\nGriboyedov was buried there, in the monastery of St. David ([[Mtatsminda Pantheon]]).<ref name=Hopkirk/>\n\nWhen Nino, Griboyedov's widow, received news of his death she gave premature birth to a child who died a few hours later. Nino lived another thirty years, rejecting all suitors and winning universal admiration for her fidelity to her husband's memory.\n\nIn a move to compensate Russia for the attack and the death of its ambassador, the Shah sent his grandson [[Khosrow Mirza]] to St. Petersburg to avoid another war with [[Tsar Nicholas I]].<ref name=Hopkirk/><ref>George Bournoutian (2014) ''From Tabriz to St. Petersburg: Iran's Mission of Apology to Russia in 1829''</ref> and also gifted to him the [[Shah Diamond]].<ref name=\"Tharoor\">{{Cite news|first=Ishaan |last=Tharoor |title=A Russian ambassador was murdered: The apology came in the shape of a huge diamond |date=22 December 2016 |newspaper=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/12/22/a-russian-ambassador-was-murdered-the-apology-came-in-the-shape-of-a-huge-diamond/ |access-date=29 January 2017 }}</ref>\n\nRussian sources claim that<ref name=\"BournoutianIRA\" /> British agents, who feared Russian influence in Tehran, and Persian reactionaries, who were not satisfied with the Turkmenchay treaty, were responsible for inciting the mob.<ref name=\"BournoutianIRA\" /> The death of Griboyedov, who was a liberal and who advocated regional autonomy for the Christians in Transcaucasia, was probably not a great loss for Tsar Nicholas or General Paskevich, both of whom wished to Russianize the minorities in the Caucasus.{{fact|date=January 2020}} The [[Russo-Turkish War (1828\u201329)]] might have been another reason for the Russian inaction.<ref name=BournoutianIRA>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Bournoutian |first=George| title=Griboyedov, Alexander Sergeevich | encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica | accessdate=2016-02-02|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/griboedov-alexander-sergeevich}}</ref> His wife had written on his tombstone in Tiflis:  \u201cYour mind and works are immortal in Russian memory, but why has my love outlived you?\u201d.<ref name=\"Tharoor\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Moscow Aleksander Griboyedov monument.JPG|thumb|Monument in Moscow]]\n[[File:Griboyedov monument 9122262 22.JPG|thumb|Griboyedov's statue in [[Yerevan]], Armenia]]\nAuthor Angela Brintlinger has said that \"not only did Griboyedov's contemporaries conceive of his life as the life of a literary hero\u2014ultimately writing a number of narratives featuring him as an essential character\u2014but indeed Griboyedov saw himself as a hero and his life as a narrative. Although there is not a literary artifact to prove this, by examining Griboyedov's letters and dispatches, one is able to build a historical narrative that fits the literary and behavioural paradigms of his time and that reads like a real adventure novel set in the wild, wild East.\"\n\nOne of the main settings for [[Mikhail Bulgakov]]'s satirical novel ''[[The Master and Margarita]]'' is named after Griboyedov, as is the [[Griboedov Canal|Griboyedov Canal]] in [[Central Saint Petersburg]].

He is recognized as ''[[homo unius libri]]'', a writer of one book, whose fame rests on the verse comedy ''[[Woe from Wit]]'' or ''The Woes of Wit''. He was Russia's ambassador to [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Persia]], where he and all the embassy staff were massacred by an [[angry mob]] as a result of the rampant anti-Russian sentiment that existed through Russia's imposing of the [[Treaty of Gulistan]] (1813) and [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]] (1828), which had forcefully ratified for Persia's ceding of its northern territories comprising [[Transcaucasia]] and parts of the [[North Caucasus]]. Griboyedov had played a pivotal role in the ratification of the latter treaty.\n\n==Early life==\nGriboyedov was born in [[Moscow]], the exact year unknown, with biographers debating whether it was in 1790 or 1795. Griboyedov received a Masters in [[philology]] from [[Moscow State University|Moscow University]], and subsequently enrolled in the doctorate program. In 1812, he quit the program and enrolled in the military.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Woe from Wit|last=Griboyedov|first=Alexander|publisher=Russian Life Books|year=2017|isbn=978-1-880100-52-3|location=Montpelier, VT|pages=6\u20137}}</ref> He obtained a commission in a [[hussar]] [[regiment]], which he resigned in 1816. The next year, he entered the [[civil service]]. In 1818 he was appointed secretary of the Russian [[legation]] in [[Persia]], and transferred to [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Griboyedov, Alexander Sergueevich|volume=12|page=593}}</ref>\n\nHis [[Poetry|verse]] comedy ''The Young Spouses'' ({{lang-ru|\u041c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0438}}, ''Molodye Suprugi''), which he staged in [[St. Petersburg]] in 1816, was followed by other similar works. Neither these nor his [[essay]]s and poetry would have been long remembered but for the success of his verse comedy ''[[Woe from Wit]]'' ({{lang-ru|\u0413\u043e\u0440\u0435 \u043e\u0442 \u0443\u043c\u0430}}, ''Gore ot Uma''), a [[satire]] on Russian [[aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] society.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nAs a high official in the play puts it, this work is \"a [[pasquinade]] on Moscow\". The play depicts certain social and official stereotypes in the characters of Famusov, who hates reform; his secretary, Molchalin, who fawns over officials; and the aristocratic young liberal and [[Anglomania]]c, Repetilov. By contrast the hero of the piece, Chatsky, an ironic satirist just returned from western Europe, exposes and ridicules the weaknesses of the rest. His words echo the outcry of the young generation in the lead-up to the [[Decembrist|armed insurrection of 1825]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIn [[Russia]] for the summer of 1823, Griboyedov completed the play and took it to St. Petersburg. It was rejected by the [[censorship|censors]]. Many copies were made and privately circulated, but Griboyedov never saw it published.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> After his death the manuscript was jointly owned by his wife [[Nino Chavchavadze|Nina Alexandrovna Griboyedova]] and his sister [[Maria Sergeyevna Durnovo (Griboyedova)]].<ref>{{cite magazine|script-title=ru:\u0417\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u041e\u0431 \u0410. \u0421. \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0431\u043e\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0435 |trans-title=A note about A.

There, thinking to devote himself to [[literature]], he started work on a romantic drama, ''A Georgian Night'' ({{lang-ru|\u0413\u0440\u0443\u0437\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043d\u043e\u0447\u044c}}, ''Gruzinskaya noch''), based on Georgian legends.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Monument of Alexander Griboyedov in Dilijan Armenia.jpg|thumb|left|Monument erected in Soviet times in [[Dilijan]], [[Armenia]] commemorating the location where [[Alexander Pushkin]] (on his way to meet his brother) stopped the carriage with Alexander Griboyedov's body being transported to [[Tiflis]].

Soon after Griboyedov's arrival in [[Tehran]], a mob stormed the [[Embassy of Russia in Tehran|Russian embassy]].\n\nThe incident began when an [[Armenians|Armenian]] [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]] escaped from the [[harem]] of the Persian [[Fath Ali Shah|shah]], and at the same time two enslaved Armenian women escaped from the harem of the Shah's son-in-law. All three sought refuge at the Russian legation. As agreed in the [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]], Georgians and Armenians living in Persia at that time were permitted to return to Georgia and [[Eastern Armenia]].<ref name=\"Hopkirk p. 122\">[[Peter Hopkirk|Hopkirk, Peter]].

His decision caused an uproar throughout the city and several thousand Persians encircled the Russian compound demanding their release.\n\nWhen Griboyedov decided to return the escaped eunuch and two Armenian women, it was too late. Soon after, urged on by the mullahs, the mob stormed the building. A high-ranking Muslim scholar with the title of Mojtahed, Mirza Masih Astarabadi known as Mirza Masih Mojtahed, issued a fatwa saying that freeing Muslim women from the claws of unbelievers is allowed.<ref name=Hopkirk>{{cite book |title=The Great Game |last=Hopkirk |first=Peter |year=2006 |publisher=John Murray |location=London |isbn=978-0-7195-6447-5 |page=113}}</ref>\n\nGriboyedov and other members of his mission had prepared for a siege and sealed all the windows and doors. Armed and in full uniform, they were resolved to defend to the last drop of blood. Although small in number, the [[Cossack]] detachment assigned to protect the legation held off the mob for over an hour until finally being driven back to Griboyedov's office. There, Griboyedov and the Cossacks resisted until the mob broke through the roof of the building, and then through the ceiling, to slaughter them. The escaped eunuch and Griboyedov, who fought with his sword, were among the first to be shot to death; the fate of the two Armenian women remains unknown.<ref name=\"Hopkirk p. 122\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Baron K.

It was eventually abandoned on a garbage heap after three days of ill-treatment by the mob, such that in the end it could be identified only by a duelling injury to a finger. The following June, Griboyedov's friend [[Alexander Pushkin]], travelling through the southern Caucasus, encountered some men from Tehran leading an oxcart. The men told Pushkin they were conveying the ambassador's remains to Tiflis (now [[Tbilisi]]).\nGriboyedov was buried there, in the monastery of St. David ([[Mtatsminda Pantheon]]).<ref name=Hopkirk/>\n\nWhen Nino, Griboyedov's widow, received news of his death she gave premature birth to a child who died a few hours later. Nino lived another thirty years, rejecting all suitors and winning universal admiration for her fidelity to her husband's memory.\n\nIn a move to compensate Russia for the attack and the death of its ambassador, the Shah sent his grandson [[Khosrow Mirza]] to St. Petersburg to avoid another war with [[Tsar Nicholas I]].<ref name=Hopkirk/><ref>George Bournoutian (2014) ''From Tabriz to St. Petersburg: Iran's Mission of Apology to Russia in 1829''</ref> and also gifted to him the [[Shah Diamond]].<ref name=\"Tharoor\">{{Cite news|first=Ishaan |last=Tharoor |title=A Russian ambassador was murdered: The apology came in the shape of a huge diamond |date=22 December 2016 |newspaper=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/12/22/a-russian-ambassador-was-murdered-the-apology-came-in-the-shape-of-a-huge-diamond/ |access-date=29 January 2017 }}</ref>\n\nRussian sources claim that<ref name=\"BournoutianIRA\" /> British agents, who feared Russian influence in Tehran, and Persian reactionaries, who were not satisfied with the Turkmenchay treaty, were responsible for inciting the mob.<ref name=\"BournoutianIRA\" /> The death of Griboyedov, who was a liberal and who advocated regional autonomy for the Christians in Transcaucasia, was probably not a great loss for Tsar Nicholas or General Paskevich, both of whom wished to Russianize the minorities in the Caucasus.{{fact|date=January 2020}} The [[Russo-Turkish War (1828\u201329)]] might have been another reason for the Russian inaction.<ref name=BournoutianIRA>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Bournoutian |first=George| title=Griboyedov, Alexander Sergeevich | encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica | accessdate=2016-02-02|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/griboedov-alexander-sergeevich}}</ref> His wife had written on his tombstone in Tiflis:  \u201cYour mind and works are immortal in Russian memory, but why has my love outlived you?\u201d.<ref name=\"Tharoor\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Moscow Aleksander Griboyedov monument.JPG|thumb|Monument in Moscow]]\n[[File:Griboyedov monument 9122262 22.JPG|thumb|Griboyedov's statue in [[Yerevan]], Armenia]]\nAuthor Angela Brintlinger has said that \"not only did Griboyedov's contemporaries conceive of his life as the life of a literary hero\u2014ultimately writing a number of narratives featuring him as an essential character\u2014but indeed Griboyedov saw himself as a hero and his life as a narrative. Although there is not a literary artifact to prove this, by examining Griboyedov's letters and dispatches, one is able to build a historical narrative that fits the literary and behavioural paradigms of his time and that reads like a real adventure novel set in the wild, wild East.\"\n\nOne of the main settings for [[Mikhail Bulgakov]]'s satirical novel ''[[The Master and Margarita]]'' is named after Griboyedov, as is the [[Griboedov Canal|Griboyedov Canal]] in [[Central Saint Petersburg]].

{"title_page": "Land recycling", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=November 2009}}\n{{tone|date=November 2009}}\n{{cleanup|date=November 2009}}\n}}\n\n'''Land recycling''' is the reuse of abandoned, vacant, or underused properties for [[redevelopment]] or repurposing.\n\nLand recycling aims to ensure the reuse of [[developed land]] as part of: new developments; [[decontamination|cleaning up]] contaminated properties; reuse and/or making use of used land surrounded by development or nearby infrastructure. End-uses from land recycling may include: mixed-use, residential, commercial, or industrial developments; and/or [[Public space|public open space]] such as [[urban open space]] use by [[urban park]]s, [[community garden]]s; or larger [[open space reserve]]s such as [[regional park]]s.\n\nSince many abandoned and underutilized properties lie within economically distressed and disadvantaged communities, land recycling often benefits and stimulates re-investment in historically under-served areas. The real or perceived presence of [[xenobiotic]] [[hazardous substance]]s from historical previous uses or ''in situ'' [[land pollution]], causing [[soil contamination]] and [[groundwater pollution]], may complicate the redevelopment of such properties. Such environmentally distressed properties, with site cleanup and mitigation considerations, are commonly referred to as [[brownfield]]s.\n\n==Synonyms==\nOther commonly used terms can relate to or serve as synonyms of land recycling:\n\n* '''[[Infill|Infill development]]''': development that takes place within existing communities, making maximum use of the existing [[infrastructure]] instead of building on previously undeveloped land; \n* '''[[Sustainable development]]''': Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs; and\n* '''[[Brownfield land|Brownfield development]]''': development of [[real property]] for which its reuse may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a [[dangerous goods|hazardous substance]], pollutant or contaminant.\n\n== Types of Land Recycling  ==\n=== Building Reuse ===\nThe most common form of land recycling is the redevelopment of abandoned or unused building properties. This involves\n\n=== Brownfields ===\nThe EPA classifies a brownfield as \"A brownfield is a property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant.\" Currently in the United States there are more than 450,000 brownfields.\n\n=== Non-Infrastructure ===\nLand Recycling can also include those spaces that are not within urbanized environments are involve a building. Agricultural reuse is a very important part of Land reuse where an existing field might have been abandoned due to nutrient depletion, and can be developed into something else. In addition to this the redevelopment of underutilized land into parks, community gardens and open space reservoirs are also prominent.\n\n==Benefits==\n\nThe US Government [[Accountability Office]] estimates that there are over 450,000 brownfields and almost {{convert|15|e6acre|km2}} of potentially contaminated properties across the United States.<ref>Brownfield Redevelopment: Stakeholders Report That EPA's Program Helps to Redevelop Sites, but Additional Measures Could Complement Agency Efforts\nGAO-05-94; December 2, 2004</ref> These sites sit idle and neglected, serving as desolate eyesores within their communities. By putting these barren infill sites to use, land recycling revitalizes communities, promotes [[sustainable development]], and preserves precious [[land resource|resources]]. The social, economic, environmental, and other benefits of land recycling include:\n\n* Social and economic [[revitalization]]\n* Sustainability\n* An alternative to [[urban sprawl|sprawl]]\n* Direction of [[economic development|development]] to urban cores\n* Addressing [[climate change]]{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n===Social and economic revitalization===\n\nLand recycling helps clean up and revitalize inner cities by returning abandoned, idle, or underused sites to productive use, bolstering [[community spirit]], creating jobs and boosting local tax-revenues.\n\nThe re-use of land revitalizes communities and renews economic activity, particularly in under-served urban areas. Abandoned, idled, and vacant properties often lie in former industrial and commercial areas, typically in urban and historically disadvantaged areas. These sites can be community eyesores, negatively impacting social and economic development, and often human and [[environmental health]]. The failure to redevelop brownfields in particular translates into potentially more exposure to toxics and the loss of economic and housing benefits that can come from appropriate redevelopment.\n\nBy putting these properties to new and productive use, land recycling encourages growth of [[business]]es and services in such areas, helping to break up concentrations of [[poverty]], creating jobs, and stimulating additional private investment and local tax-revenue. An abandoned, well-situated, factory site can be cleaned up and redeveloped into a much-needed mixed-use development with a grocery store, senior housing, and access to public transportation. The addition of neighborhood-serving retail, affordable housing, or a clean public park in a disadvantaged community can boost local spirit and improve overall quality of life.\n\n=== An alternative to sprawl ===\nLand recycling increases density in urban areas, by reducing [[urban sprawl]] and unplanned, low-density, [[automobile]]-dependent developments.\n\nSprawl development scatters housing, public transit, jobs and other amenities farther apart, demanding more frequent use of cars for travel. The increase in vehicle-miles traveled (VMTs) produces a range of health and environmental problems, including air pollution and increased greenhouse gas emissions, and increased incidence of traffic jams and asthma. This results in a lower quality of life for residents, ever-increasing commute times, and the health implications of smog.\n\nBy moving new jobs, economic opportunities and community amenities farther from established populations, sprawl development can cripple once-thriving cities. This trend takes a toll on the socio-economic health of urban communities as growth retreats from the urban center.\n\nRather than take advantage of existing infrastructure such as roads, public transit, and public works, building sprawl projects abandons these resources and demands further consumption of land and resources.\n\nLand recycling offers an intelligent alternative to sprawl development. It reuses vital infrastructure and public resources and creates compact, full-service neighborhoods that reduce [[vehicle use]] and [[carbon dependence]]. Rebuilding in urban neighborhoods generates reinvestment in vibrant economic and cultural centers, rather than drawing away much-needed resources. Compact, urban development through land recycling is essential to sustainable development and is key to managing rapid population growth across the United States and beyond. As daily commute times decrease, the general quality of life improves as residents have more time to enjoy the world around them.\n\n===Directing development to urban cores===\nRedirecting population growth and growth of businesses to already urbanized areas is integral to fostering sustainable communities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Applying sustainable principles to land use and growth management requires that growth be redirected from scattered fringe areas back to our urban cores, where people, services and infrastructure already exist. Building up our urban areas positively increases population density, providing the critical mass to support local services from coffee shops to grocery stores, public transit to libraries and symphony halls. Land recycling provides opportunities for urban renewal and to build truly livable communities: efficient, compact, vibrant urban neighborhoods integrated with public transit systems, which offer a mix of uses as well as affordable housing.\n\n===Addressing climate change===\nLand recycling effectively curbs [[greenhouse gas|greenhouse-gas]] emissions by encouraging smart, compact growth that reduces [[vehicle dependence]]. Redevelopment within an urban core reduces commuting distances and therefore average vehicle miles traveled (VMTs) by creating residential, office, and other amenities within close proximity. Since transportation alone accounts for a third of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted in the United States, land recycling offers a key tool in any fight against climate change.  A recent Urban Land Institute study found that compact urban developments reduce the number of vehicle miles traveled (VMTs) by 20 to 40 percent <ref>Urban Land Institute.  Growing Cooler: The Evidence of Urban Development and Climate Change.  Available at  {{cite web|url=http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/gcindex.html|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224212241/http://smartgrowthamerica.org/gcindex.html|archivedate=2010-12-24|accessdate=2014-04-01}}</ref> because users are closer to amenities and can more easily rely on public transportation. Smart urban planning is therefore crucial to maximizing energy savings and overall reduction of greenhouse gases.\n\n=== Leaders in Energy and Environmental Design Certification ===\n[[File:LEED Gold 2016 plaque, Serrano 55 Madrid (cropped).jpg|thumb|174x174px|LEED Gold Plaque in a Certified Building]]\n{{As of | 2009}} the green movement has started to emphasize the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) Green Building Rating System, a certification system that rewards the design, construction and operation of high-performance green buildings. LEED certification signifies incorporation of smart building design and technology to reduce energy use and minimize waste. However, even if a building is energy-efficient, the energy required to travel to and from a LEED certified site may well exceed the energy saved through energy-efficient features. LEED certified buildings and other developments best benefit climate change when they reuse infill sites and access existing resources.\n\nLEED Certification can also benefit the occupant of the reused building. As sustainability becomes more prioritized within the building movement, having a LEED certified building becomes more desirable This certification may persuade public opinion and encourage more of the population to seek services by a company that prioritizes sustainability. In addition to this, some governmental bodies provide monetary benefits for prioritizing a sustainable cite such as tax breaks and stipends.\n\n==Sustainability ==\n[[Sustainability]] involves meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\n\nLand recycling expresses an inherently sustainable idea, based on the same common-sense as recycling an aluminum can. Like other natural resources, land represents a shared investment that should be reused and recycled, rather than [[land consumption|consumed]] and abandoned after use. [[Recycling paper]] saves trees, reusing land saves land.\n\nBy encouraging the recycling rather than the consumption of land, land recycling promotes [[smart growth]] and responsible, sustainable patterns of development. A 2001 study by George Washington University shows that for every acre of brownfield redeveloped, {{convert|4.5|acre|m2}} of undeveloped land is conserved.\n[http://www.gwu.edu/~eem/Brownfields/project_report/chapters-html.htm#chapter5 Public Policies and Private Decisions Affecting the Redevelopment of Brownfields: An Analysis of Critical Factors, Relative Weights and Areal Differentials]. As most brownfields and other abandoned sites are typically situated in urban areas, they tap into existing nearby infrastructure, limiting the need to build new roads, gridlines, and amenities, thereby reducing further land consumption. Each infill development prevents sprawl into open space, forests and agricultural land, preserving acres of undeveloped land.\n\n=== Sustainable Land Remediation and Planning ===\nLand development is an aspect of land recycling which involves urbanization and development of land, by reusing previously abandoned and unused land in commercial areas of larger cities.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cclr.org/3-benefits-land-recycling|title=3.

The inclusion of garden cities, which are cities built with the intention of avoiding disrupting previously present natural ecosystems.<ref name=\":5\" /> An example is the Hampstead garden suburb began formulating plans which focused on preservation of natural beauty in the area, by avoiding removing the plant life that was already there and working to build around it.<ref name=\":5\" /> This also spread to other countries in Europe with Germany building its first garden city in 1909 and Canberra in Australia where the main goal was to reestablish and maintain forest cover around the city.<ref name=\":5\" /> Later, Design with Nature written by Ian McHarg, influenced a lot of the sustainable development goals which were implemented all over the world.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn the US, a city beautification movement started in the early 20th century, many cities were redeveloped as part of the movement but Chicago was the most influenced.<ref name=\":5\" /> As the city was being physical improved they found that there was a need for more focus on development and its social implications.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> As time went on there were also more conversations about the influence that people have on their environment with more literature about the effects of environmental degradation became more mainstream.<ref name=\":5\" /> This allowed more intersectional land development goals to be implemented when looking at the different needs of people in different countries.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Challenges==\nWhile land recycling has great economic and environmental benefits, without the right tools, skills, and knowledge, reusing land can produce certain challenges.  Obstacles to redevelopment may include lack of funding and increased scrutiny. These can particularly impede projects on brownfields, which carry the stigma of contamination. Because of these concerns, the perceived ease of developing on open land, or [[greenfield land|greenfields]], remains alluring to many. Factors that hinder land recycling include:\n\n* market factors\n* environmental-liability risks\n* uncertainty and cost\n* complicated/confusing regulatory requirements\n* difficulty in obtaining project financing\n* the lure of greenfields\n\n===Market factors===\nAs the saying goes, in [[real estate]] only three things matter: location, location, location. Because idled and underused infill sites are often located in distressed urban areas concerns arise about crime, safety, and access to quality education and services. These and other market factors frequently pull development to open land near traditionally desirable communities and away from urban infill sites.\n\n====Greenfields competition====\nBrownfields and infill sites must compete with attractive, undeveloped suburban and rural land, also called [[greenfield land]]. When considering the real or perceived risks and costs of land recycling, a greenfield development may seem more economically sensible as the immediate costs are typically less than developing on an infill or brownfield site. However, it is important to consider the long-term economic gain of land recycling and the added social and environmental rewards of sustainable development.\n\n===Brownfields===\nAs defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency, a [[brownfield]] site is \u201creal property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant\u201d. In other words, brownfield sites comprise abandoned, idled, or underused industrial and commercial facilities where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by real or perceived environmental contamination.\n\n\n'''Brownfield Remediation''' \n\nBrownfield sites are not being repurposed or reused because of the amount of toxins left over from urban industrialization. These sites are can cause serious health risks to a large number of people. Since these sites have a high levels of land contamination, there is a high cost of remediation. Processes to reduce land contamination, either physical or chemical technologies can also cause more infectivity and loss of land function. Nature-based solutions is an idea being talked about to produce a more environmental space. Nature-based solutions can be looked at as policies and approaches to environmental issues that are in benefit to human health and biodiversity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719303985|title=Nature Based Solutions|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> These nature-based solutions promote environmentally friendly strategies instead of your regular industrial approaches that have climate hazards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guidetoes.eu/synthesispapers/OpenNESS_SP18_2016.pdf|title=Nature Based Solutions|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> An example would include developing a permeable green area, from these brownfield sites. Phytoremediation is another environmentally friendly approach for brownfield remediation. Phytoremediation programs reduce contaminants in the soil, water and air through planting different types of plants. Important metals that are harmful to human health such as Se, Zn, Ni and Fe are removed from this to contaminated soil through this process.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/phytoremediation|title=Phytoremediation|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> These procedures are inexpensive because the plants rely on sunlight and the recycled nutrients in the ground. Although, phytoremediation cannot be used the same way in every destination due to different types of plants nurture differently in different types of environments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/pubs/12487|title=Phytoremediation|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> It depends on the soil, where the plant is placed, if it is getting enough nutrients to thrive, etc. The plants end up being greatly polluted from heavy metals, that they need to be disposed of. Thermal treatment is used as a disposal option. Thermal treatment implicates the combustion of the waste materials through machines that produce high enough temperatures, which decomposes the organic molecules within the plant.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/thermal-treatment|title=Thermal Treatment|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> This treatment is typically used in the residential and industrial scale, making it useful for brownfield sites.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653516312747|title=Thermal Treatment|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n====Uncertainty and costs====\nAssessing whether or not a site is contaminated can be a costly process that deters land reuse. Potential purchasers are often unwilling or unable to risk an investment in a site assessment for a property that may require cleanup they cannot afford. Even if a site has been purchased, concerns over cleanup costs may further stall redevelopment. Uncertainty over time, cost or a high price for cleanup leaves many brownfield sites in development limbo.\n\n====Project financing====\nObtaining private front-end financing for brownfield cleanup can be a difficult process.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wolf|first=Michael Allan|date=1997-1998|title=Dangerous Crossing: State Brownfields Recycling and Federal Enterprise Zoning|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/frdmev9&id=503&div=&collection=|journal=Fordham Environmental Law Journal|volume=9|pages=495}}</ref> Since financing is more readably available for development on greenfields, infill and brownfield sites are often passed over.\n\n==== Environmental Justice ====\nThe concern for contamination of new occupants of a redeveloped brownfield is a concern. Communities of color and low income are disproportionately affected by pollution and brownfield sites offer a higher risk to the communities surrounding them. Many suggest that brownfield programs are a good alternative to the Superfund Act, but the standards of cleanup need to be highly considered in order to avoid future contamination.\n\n===Environmental-liability risks===\nAlthough recent changes in some country's federal laws provide some liability relief to new purchasers of contaminated properties, the law remains very complex and many state laws still have strict liability covering real property. Thus, in many cases, any current or past property owner can potentially be legally and financially liable regardless of who is responsible for contamination. This liability web continues to throw a chill on many brownfield projects even in the presence of regulatory reforms designed to encourage redevelopment. A common belief among many brownfield owners is that it is less risky and cheaper to abandon or \u201cmothball\u201d a facility than to conduct a site assessment that could trigger large cleanup costs and potential liability.\n\n====Regulatory requirements====\nThe potentially complex process of successfully redeveloping an infill site, particularly a brownfield, can challenge land recycling interest and proposals.  Understanding and complying with federal, state, and local legal and regulatory requirements can be daunting for some property owners and developers. Guidance from legal specialists and environmental cleanup consultants is often needed to design, develop, and guide a project through the process of regulatory requirements and permitting approvals.\n\n=== Gentrification ===\nBecause most communities with underutilized buildings are those in poverty, an existing company coming in and investing in reimagining it can raise a concern of gentrification. The new building can lead to wealthier people coming in and causing displacement of existing residents. Depending on the building occupancy, such as a new apartment complex charging a higher rent, this can drive for higher priced services to come in and eventually push out existing residents who can no longer afford to live in the area.\n\n== Global Land Recycling ==\n\n=== Developed Countries  ===\n\n==== Land Recycling in the EU ====\nAn in-depth examination of land recycling in different countries shows many different perspectives on implementations of land recycling.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Trefzer|first=Annette|last2=Jackson|first2=Jeffrey T.|last3=McKee|first3=Kathryn|last4=Dellinger|first4=Kirsten|date=2014|title=Introduction: The Global South and/in the Global North: Interdisciplinary Investigations|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585671|journal=The Global South|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=1\u201315|issn=1932-8656}}</ref> The general European focus looked at land use in the EU and the importance of reducing new land use as well as reducing addition of impervious surface which disrupts natural ecosystems.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/land-recycling-in-europe|title=Land recycling in Europe|website=European Environment Agency|language=en|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> Beginning with research, a main database called Copernicus is used in the EU to monitor land use changes, its main components are Corine Land Cover (CLC) and Urban Atlas (UA).<ref name=\":0\" /> Each of these has its own indicators for measuring increasing land use and increasing urbanization, for Corine Land Cover the flows of land recycling are split based on previously developed and undeveloped land because they each have different potential to produce green urban infrastructure.<ref name=\":0\" /> For the Urban Atlas database, the focus is the same but more geographically and theme specific accuracy so it used to test more of the land recycling indicators.<ref name=\":0\" /> The indicators were tested in all the countries in Europe from 1990-2002 in three sections, the tests were used to compare projections and determine the meaningfulness of land recycling using data from the CLC and UA datasets.<ref name=\":0\" /> The results of the data analysis showed little to no trends in land recycling and more variation in between the different European countries.<ref name=\":0\" /> The approach of the EU then focused more on the large scale environmental impacts of land recycling by quantification and identification of places where land use could be improved.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Land Development in Germany ====\nOn a smaller scale, Germany focused on limiting the amount of land conversion specifically for settling and traffic to 30ha per day starting in 2002 as a part of the National Sustainability Strategy.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Dillmann|first=Oliver|last2=Beckmann|first2=Volker|date=2018-12-12|title=Do Administrative Incentives for the Containment of Cities Work?

This program was established in 1995 and is also known as the Voluntary Cleanup Program. This program aims to set four main standards, the first is to set structured standards. This allows for public knowledge of the cost of cleaning up a site, and ensures the protection of the present and future use of the site. The second standard is granted liability relief. The third standard promotes transparency by giving specific time frames for clean ups and routine reporting of what is being done on the site. Lastly, the fourth standard for this land recycling program is providing financial assistance for cleanups.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dep.pa.gov:443/Business/Land/LandRecycling/Pages/default.aspx|title=Land Recycling Program|website=Department of Environmental Protection|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Ghirardelli Square ===\n[[Ghirardelli Square]] is in San Francisco, California and is the center of many examples of land recycling and building reuse.

End-uses from land recycling may include: mixed-use, residential, commercial, or industrial developments; and/or [[Public space|public open space]] such as [[urban open space]] use by [[urban park]]s, [[community garden]]s; or larger [[open space reserve]]s such as [[regional park]]s.\n\nSince many abandoned and underutilized properties lie within economically distressed and disadvantaged communities, land recycling often benefits and stimulates re-investment in historically under-served areas. The real or perceived presence of [[xenobiotic]] [[hazardous substance]]s from historical previous uses or ''in situ'' [[land pollution]], causing [[soil contamination]] and [[groundwater pollution]], may complicate the redevelopment of such properties. Such environmentally distressed properties, with site cleanup and mitigation considerations, are commonly referred to as [[brownfield]]s.\n\n==Synonyms==\nOther commonly used terms can relate to or serve as synonyms of land recycling:\n\n* '''[[Infill|Infill development]]''': development that takes place within existing communities, making maximum use of the existing [[infrastructure]] instead of building on previously undeveloped land; \n* '''[[Sustainable development]]''': Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs; and\n* '''[[Brownfield land|Brownfield development]]''': development of [[real property]] for which its reuse may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a [[dangerous goods|hazardous substance]], pollutant or contaminant.\n\n== Types of Land Recycling  ==\n=== Building Reuse ===\nThe most common form of land recycling is the redevelopment of abandoned or unused building properties. This involves\n\n=== Brownfields ===\nThe EPA classifies a brownfield as \"A brownfield is a property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant.\" Currently in the United States there are more than 450,000 brownfields.\n\n=== Non-Infrastructure ===\nLand Recycling can also include those spaces that are not within urbanized environments are involve a building. Agricultural reuse is a very important part of Land reuse where an existing field might have been abandoned due to nutrient depletion, and can be developed into something else. In addition to this the redevelopment of underutilized land into parks, community gardens and open space reservoirs are also prominent.\n\n==Benefits==\n\nThe US Government [[Accountability Office]] estimates that there are over 450,000 brownfields and almost {{convert|15|e6acre|km2}} of potentially contaminated properties across the United States.<ref>Brownfield Redevelopment: Stakeholders Report That EPA's Program Helps to Redevelop Sites, but Additional Measures Could Complement Agency Efforts\nGAO-05-94; December 2, 2004</ref> These sites sit idle and neglected, serving as desolate eyesores within their communities. By putting these barren infill sites to use, land recycling revitalizes communities, promotes [[sustainable development]], and preserves precious [[land resource|resources]]. The social, economic, environmental, and other benefits of land recycling include:\n\n* Social and economic [[revitalization]]\n* Sustainability\n* An alternative to [[urban sprawl|sprawl]]\n* Direction of [[economic development|development]] to urban cores\n* Addressing [[climate change]]{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n===Social and economic revitalization===\n\nLand recycling helps clean up and revitalize inner cities by returning abandoned, idle, or underused sites to productive use, bolstering [[community spirit]], creating jobs and boosting local tax-revenues.\n\nThe re-use of land revitalizes communities and renews economic activity, particularly in under-served urban areas. Abandoned, idled, and vacant properties often lie in former industrial and commercial areas, typically in urban and historically disadvantaged areas. These sites can be community eyesores, negatively impacting social and economic development, and often human and [[environmental health]]. The failure to redevelop brownfields in particular translates into potentially more exposure to toxics and the loss of economic and housing benefits that can come from appropriate redevelopment.\n\nBy putting these properties to new and productive use, land recycling encourages growth of [[business]]es and services in such areas, helping to break up concentrations of [[poverty]], creating jobs, and stimulating additional private investment and local tax-revenue. An abandoned, well-situated, factory site can be cleaned up and redeveloped into a much-needed mixed-use development with a grocery store, senior housing, and access to public transportation. The addition of neighborhood-serving retail, affordable housing, or a clean public park in a disadvantaged community can boost local spirit and improve overall quality of life.\n\n=== An alternative to sprawl ===\nLand recycling increases density in urban areas, by reducing [[urban sprawl]] and unplanned, low-density, [[automobile]]-dependent developments.\n\nSprawl development scatters housing, public transit, jobs and other amenities farther apart, demanding more frequent use of cars for travel. The increase in vehicle-miles traveled (VMTs) produces a range of health and environmental problems, including air pollution and increased greenhouse gas emissions, and increased incidence of traffic jams and asthma. This results in a lower quality of life for residents, ever-increasing commute times, and the health implications of smog.\n\nBy moving new jobs, economic opportunities and community amenities farther from established populations, sprawl development can cripple once-thriving cities. This trend takes a toll on the socio-economic health of urban communities as growth retreats from the urban center.\n\nRather than take advantage of existing infrastructure such as roads, public transit, and public works, building sprawl projects abandons these resources and demands further consumption of land and resources.\n\nLand recycling offers an intelligent alternative to sprawl development. It reuses vital infrastructure and public resources and creates compact, full-service neighborhoods that reduce [[vehicle use]] and [[carbon dependence]]. Rebuilding in urban neighborhoods generates reinvestment in vibrant economic and cultural centers, rather than drawing away much-needed resources. Compact, urban development through land recycling is essential to sustainable development and is key to managing rapid population growth across the United States and beyond. As daily commute times decrease, the general quality of life improves as residents have more time to enjoy the world around them.\n\n===Directing development to urban cores===\nRedirecting population growth and growth of businesses to already urbanized areas is integral to fostering sustainable communities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Applying sustainable principles to land use and growth management requires that growth be redirected from scattered fringe areas back to our urban cores, where people, services and infrastructure already exist. Building up our urban areas positively increases population density, providing the critical mass to support local services from coffee shops to grocery stores, public transit to libraries and symphony halls. Land recycling provides opportunities for urban renewal and to build truly livable communities: efficient, compact, vibrant urban neighborhoods integrated with public transit systems, which offer a mix of uses as well as affordable housing.\n\n===Addressing climate change===\nLand recycling effectively curbs [[greenhouse gas|greenhouse-gas]] emissions by encouraging smart, compact growth that reduces [[vehicle dependence]]. Redevelopment within an urban core reduces commuting distances and therefore average vehicle miles traveled (VMTs) by creating residential, office, and other amenities within close proximity. Since transportation alone accounts for a third of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted in the United States, land recycling offers a key tool in any fight against climate change.  A recent Urban Land Institute study found that compact urban developments reduce the number of vehicle miles traveled (VMTs) by 20 to 40 percent <ref>Urban Land Institute.  Growing Cooler: The Evidence of Urban Development and Climate Change.

Smart urban planning is therefore crucial to maximizing energy savings and overall reduction of greenhouse gases.\n\n=== Leaders in Energy and Environmental Design Certification ===\n[[File:LEED Gold 2016 plaque, Serrano 55 Madrid (cropped).jpg|thumb|174x174px|LEED Gold Plaque in a Certified Building]]\n{{As of | 2009}} the green movement has started to emphasize the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) Green Building Rating System, a certification system that rewards the design, construction and operation of high-performance green buildings. LEED certification signifies incorporation of smart building design and technology to reduce energy use and minimize waste. However, even if a building is energy-efficient, the energy required to travel to and from a LEED certified site may well exceed the energy saved through energy-efficient features. LEED certified buildings and other developments best benefit climate change when they reuse infill sites and access existing resources.\n\nLEED Certification can also benefit the occupant of the reused building. As sustainability becomes more prioritized within the building movement, having a LEED certified building becomes more desirable This certification may persuade public opinion and encourage more of the population to seek services by a company that prioritizes sustainability. In addition to this, some governmental bodies provide monetary benefits for prioritizing a sustainable cite such as tax breaks and stipends.\n\n==Sustainability ==\n[[Sustainability]] involves meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\n\nLand recycling expresses an inherently sustainable idea, based on the same common-sense as recycling an aluminum can. Like other natural resources, land represents a shared investment that should be reused and recycled, rather than [[land consumption|consumed]] and abandoned after use. [[Recycling paper]] saves trees, reusing land saves land.\n\nBy encouraging the recycling rather than the consumption of land, land recycling promotes [[smart growth]] and responsible, sustainable patterns of development. A 2001 study by George Washington University shows that for every acre of brownfield redeveloped, {{convert|4.5|acre|m2}} of undeveloped land is conserved.\n[http://www.gwu.edu/~eem/Brownfields/project_report/chapters-html.htm#chapter5 Public Policies and Private Decisions Affecting the Redevelopment of Brownfields: An Analysis of Critical Factors, Relative Weights and Areal Differentials]. As most brownfields and other abandoned sites are typically situated in urban areas, they tap into existing nearby infrastructure, limiting the need to build new roads, gridlines, and amenities, thereby reducing further land consumption. Each infill development prevents sprawl into open space, forests and agricultural land, preserving acres of undeveloped land.\n\n=== Sustainable Land Remediation and Planning ===\nLand development is an aspect of land recycling which involves urbanization and development of land, by reusing previously abandoned and unused land in commercial areas of larger cities.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cclr.org/3-benefits-land-recycling|title=3.

Obstacles to redevelopment may include lack of funding and increased scrutiny. These can particularly impede projects on brownfields, which carry the stigma of contamination. Because of these concerns, the perceived ease of developing on open land, or [[greenfield land|greenfields]], remains alluring to many. Factors that hinder land recycling include:\n\n* market factors\n* environmental-liability risks\n* uncertainty and cost\n* complicated/confusing regulatory requirements\n* difficulty in obtaining project financing\n* the lure of greenfields\n\n===Market factors===\nAs the saying goes, in [[real estate]] only three things matter: location, location, location. Because idled and underused infill sites are often located in distressed urban areas concerns arise about crime, safety, and access to quality education and services. These and other market factors frequently pull development to open land near traditionally desirable communities and away from urban infill sites.\n\n====Greenfields competition====\nBrownfields and infill sites must compete with attractive, undeveloped suburban and rural land, also called [[greenfield land]]. When considering the real or perceived risks and costs of land recycling, a greenfield development may seem more economically sensible as the immediate costs are typically less than developing on an infill or brownfield site. However, it is important to consider the long-term economic gain of land recycling and the added social and environmental rewards of sustainable development.\n\n===Brownfields===\nAs defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency, a [[brownfield]] site is \u201creal property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant\u201d. In other words, brownfield sites comprise abandoned, idled, or underused industrial and commercial facilities where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by real or perceived environmental contamination.\n\n\n'''Brownfield Remediation''' \n\nBrownfield sites are not being repurposed or reused because of the amount of toxins left over from urban industrialization. These sites are can cause serious health risks to a large number of people. Since these sites have a high levels of land contamination, there is a high cost of remediation. Processes to reduce land contamination, either physical or chemical technologies can also cause more infectivity and loss of land function. Nature-based solutions is an idea being talked about to produce a more environmental space. Nature-based solutions can be looked at as policies and approaches to environmental issues that are in benefit to human health and biodiversity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719303985|title=Nature Based Solutions|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> These nature-based solutions promote environmentally friendly strategies instead of your regular industrial approaches that have climate hazards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guidetoes.eu/synthesispapers/OpenNESS_SP18_2016.pdf|title=Nature Based Solutions|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> An example would include developing a permeable green area, from these brownfield sites. Phytoremediation is another environmentally friendly approach for brownfield remediation. Phytoremediation programs reduce contaminants in the soil, water and air through planting different types of plants. Important metals that are harmful to human health such as Se, Zn, Ni and Fe are removed from this to contaminated soil through this process.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/phytoremediation|title=Phytoremediation|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> These procedures are inexpensive because the plants rely on sunlight and the recycled nutrients in the ground. Although, phytoremediation cannot be used the same way in every destination due to different types of plants nurture differently in different types of environments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/pubs/12487|title=Phytoremediation|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> It depends on the soil, where the plant is placed, if it is getting enough nutrients to thrive, etc. The plants end up being greatly polluted from heavy metals, that they need to be disposed of. Thermal treatment is used as a disposal option. Thermal treatment implicates the combustion of the waste materials through machines that produce high enough temperatures, which decomposes the organic molecules within the plant.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/thermal-treatment|title=Thermal Treatment|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> This treatment is typically used in the residential and industrial scale, making it useful for brownfield sites.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653516312747|title=Thermal Treatment|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n====Uncertainty and costs====\nAssessing whether or not a site is contaminated can be a costly process that deters land reuse. Potential purchasers are often unwilling or unable to risk an investment in a site assessment for a property that may require cleanup they cannot afford. Even if a site has been purchased, concerns over cleanup costs may further stall redevelopment. Uncertainty over time, cost or a high price for cleanup leaves many brownfield sites in development limbo.\n\n====Project financing====\nObtaining private front-end financing for brownfield cleanup can be a difficult process.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wolf|first=Michael Allan|date=1997-1998|title=Dangerous Crossing: State Brownfields Recycling and Federal Enterprise Zoning|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/frdmev9&id=503&div=&collection=|journal=Fordham Environmental Law Journal|volume=9|pages=495}}</ref> Since financing is more readably available for development on greenfields, infill and brownfield sites are often passed over.\n\n==== Environmental Justice ====\nThe concern for contamination of new occupants of a redeveloped brownfield is a concern. Communities of color and low income are disproportionately affected by pollution and brownfield sites offer a higher risk to the communities surrounding them. Many suggest that brownfield programs are a good alternative to the Superfund Act, but the standards of cleanup need to be highly considered in order to avoid future contamination.\n\n===Environmental-liability risks===\nAlthough recent changes in some country's federal laws provide some liability relief to new purchasers of contaminated properties, the law remains very complex and many state laws still have strict liability covering real property. Thus, in many cases, any current or past property owner can potentially be legally and financially liable regardless of who is responsible for contamination. This liability web continues to throw a chill on many brownfield projects even in the presence of regulatory reforms designed to encourage redevelopment. A common belief among many brownfield owners is that it is less risky and cheaper to abandon or \u201cmothball\u201d a facility than to conduct a site assessment that could trigger large cleanup costs and potential liability.\n\n====Regulatory requirements====\nThe potentially complex process of successfully redeveloping an infill site, particularly a brownfield, can challenge land recycling interest and proposals.  Understanding and complying with federal, state, and local legal and regulatory requirements can be daunting for some property owners and developers. Guidance from legal specialists and environmental cleanup consultants is often needed to design, develop, and guide a project through the process of regulatory requirements and permitting approvals.\n\n=== Gentrification ===\nBecause most communities with underutilized buildings are those in poverty, an existing company coming in and investing in reimagining it can raise a concern of gentrification. The new building can lead to wealthier people coming in and causing displacement of existing residents. Depending on the building occupancy, such as a new apartment complex charging a higher rent, this can drive for higher priced services to come in and eventually push out existing residents who can no longer afford to live in the area.\n\n== Global Land Recycling ==\n\n=== Developed Countries  ===\n\n==== Land Recycling in the EU ====\nAn in-depth examination of land recycling in different countries shows many different perspectives on implementations of land recycling.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Trefzer|first=Annette|last2=Jackson|first2=Jeffrey T.|last3=McKee|first3=Kathryn|last4=Dellinger|first4=Kirsten|date=2014|title=Introduction: The Global South and/in the Global North: Interdisciplinary Investigations|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585671|journal=The Global South|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=1\u201315|issn=1932-8656}}</ref> The general European focus looked at land use in the EU and the importance of reducing new land use as well as reducing addition of impervious surface which disrupts natural ecosystems.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/land-recycling-in-europe|title=Land recycling in Europe|website=European Environment Agency|language=en|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> Beginning with research, a main database called Copernicus is used in the EU to monitor land use changes, its main components are Corine Land Cover (CLC) and Urban Atlas (UA).<ref name=\":0\" /> Each of these has its own indicators for measuring increasing land use and increasing urbanization, for Corine Land Cover the flows of land recycling are split based on previously developed and undeveloped land because they each have different potential to produce green urban infrastructure.<ref name=\":0\" /> For the Urban Atlas database, the focus is the same but more geographically and theme specific accuracy so it used to test more of the land recycling indicators.<ref name=\":0\" /> The indicators were tested in all the countries in Europe from 1990-2002 in three sections, the tests were used to compare projections and determine the meaningfulness of land recycling using data from the CLC and UA datasets.<ref name=\":0\" /> The results of the data analysis showed little to no trends in land recycling and more variation in between the different European countries.<ref name=\":0\" /> The approach of the EU then focused more on the large scale environmental impacts of land recycling by quantification and identification of places where land use could be improved.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Land Development in Germany ====\nOn a smaller scale, Germany focused on limiting the amount of land conversion specifically for settling and traffic to 30ha per day starting in 2002 as a part of the National Sustainability Strategy.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Dillmann|first=Oliver|last2=Beckmann|first2=Volker|date=2018-12-12|title=Do Administrative Incentives for the Containment of Cities Work?

This program was established in 1995 and is also known as the Voluntary Cleanup Program. This program aims to set four main standards, the first is to set structured standards. This allows for public knowledge of the cost of cleaning up a site, and ensures the protection of the present and future use of the site. The second standard is granted liability relief. The third standard promotes transparency by giving specific time frames for clean ups and routine reporting of what is being done on the site. Lastly, the fourth standard for this land recycling program is providing financial assistance for cleanups.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dep.pa.gov:443/Business/Land/LandRecycling/Pages/default.aspx|title=Land Recycling Program|website=Department of Environmental Protection|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Ghirardelli Square ===\n[[Ghirardelli Square]] is in San Francisco, California and is the center of many examples of land recycling and building reuse. Designed by [[Lawrence Halprin]] and [[William Wurster]] opening in 1964, this was one of the first examples of major land recycling in the United States. Surrounding this square is many buildings and waterfront properties that were originally used for production of local goods as well as transportation through the bay. No longer needed for their original uses, these buildings have been transformed and retrofitted to accommodate the needs of the community and attract tourism.\n\nThe inclusion of new retail spaces, offices, and residential properties in these existing abandoned buildings not only put to use otherwise empty spaces but also prevent the erection of new structures and therefore use less materials, energy, and land. In addition to this, [[Ghirardelli Square]] also shows the change of building use to reflect the needs of the residents. Churches specifically have changed from predominantly Christian to other religious uses or convert into secular uses such as housing and businesses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghirardelli_Square|title=Ghirardelli Square|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Foundation Hotel ===\n[[File:Foundation Hotel.png|thumb|232x232px|Foundation Hotel in Detroit, Michigan]]\nThe Foundation Hotel in Detroit Michigan is an adaptive reuse project designed by local firm McIntosh Poris Associates (MPA) with collaboration with Simone Deary Design group. This project actually combined two adjacent buildings that were not in use. The main building was built in 1929 and originally housed the city\u2019s oldest fire department. The additional building was once home to Pontchartrain Wine Cellars. \u00a0In 2013 the fire department moved out and the building was left unoccupied for over a year until bought by Aparium Hotel Group.\n\nThis project focused on the new needs of the community while still preserving the aesthetic and incorporated historic preservation in their work. This is significant because as stated above, gentrification can be a major negative effect during land recycling and the attempt to maintain the existing exterior of the building counteracts this.\n<br />\n==also==\n\n*[[Bioremediation]]\n*[[Green development]]\n*[[Land banking]]\n*[[New Urbanism]]\n*[[Sustainable design]]\n*[[Sustainable development]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==<ref name=\":5\" /> External links<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":2\" />==\n* [http://www.cclr.org Center for Creative Land Recycling]\n* {{cite book\n|editor-last=Fleming\n|editor-first=George\n|title= Recycling derelict land\n|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IEKC60pckAQC\n|accessdate= 2009-11-08\n|year= 1991\n|publisher= Thomas Telford\n|isbn= 978-0-7277-1318-6\n}}\n\n{{recycling|state=expanded}}\n\n[[Category:Land use]]\n[[Category:Sustainable development]]\n[[Category:Sustainable urban planning]]\n[[Category:New Urbanism]]\n[[Category:Urban studies and planning terminology]]\n[[Category:Environmental issues with soil]]\n[[Category:Redevelopment]]\n[[Category:Recycling]]\n", "name_user": "Milleanr", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_recycling"}
