The guidance covers specific issues like musculoskeletal pain, which is reported in up to 75% of survivors. The pain is symmetrical and more pronounced in the morning, with the larger joints most affected. There is also possible periarticular [[tenosynovitis]] affecting the shoulders. The WHO guidelines advise to distinguish non-inflammatory [[arthralgia]] from inflammatory [[arthritis]]. With regard to ocular problems, sensitivity to light and blurry vision have been indicated among survivors. Among the aftereffects of Ebola virus disease, uveitis and optic nerve disease could appear after an individual is discharged. Ocular problems could threaten sight in survivors, thus the need for prompt treatment. In treating such individuals, the WHO recommends urgent intervention if uveitis is suspected; this consists mainly of prednisone (a [[corticosteroid]]). Hearing loss has been reported in Ebola survivors 25% of the time. Treatment, in the case of acute [[labyrinthitis]] (inner ear disorder), should be given within 10 days of the onset of symptoms and prochlorperazine, a vestibular sedative, may be administered for [[vertigo]].<ref>{{cite report|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/204235/1/WHO_EVD_OHE_PED_16.1_eng.pdf?ua=1 |format= PDF|title=Clinical care for survivors of Ebola virus disease|publisher=WHO |date=11 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Post-Ebola virus syndrome ===\n{{See also|Post-Ebola virus syndrome}}\nThere are at least 17,000 people who have survived infection from the Ebola virus in Western Africa; some of them have reported lingering health effects.<ref name=\"Carod-Artal\">{{cite journal|title=Post-Ebolavirus disease syndrome: what do we know?|vauthors=Carod-Artal FJ|pmid=26293407|doi=10.1586/14787210.2015.1079128|volume=13|issue=10|year=2015|journal=Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther|pages=1185\u20137}}</ref> In early November, a WHO consultant reported:  \"Many of the survivors are discharged with the so-called Post-Ebola Syndrome.

Similarly, all affected countries had sufficient and widespread capacity to bury reported deaths; however, because not all deaths were reported, it was possible that the reverse could have been the case in some areas. WHO also reported that every district had access to a laboratory to confirm cases of Ebola within 24 hours of sample collection, and that all three countries had reported that more than 80% of registered contacts associated with known cases of Ebola virus disease were being traced, although contact tracing was still a challenge in areas of intense transmission and those with community resistance.<ref name=WHO2014_12_10 />\n\n=== Healthcare settings ===\n{{fig\n |17\n |Kerry Town Ebola Treatment Centre in Sierra Leone MOD 45158320.jpg\n |Ebola treatment centre built by the UK in Kerry Town, Sierra Leone, in 2014\n |attribution = Carl Osmond/Open Government Licence\n}}\n\nA number of [[Aspen Medical|Ebola Treatment Centres]] were set up in the area, supported by international aid organisations and staffed by a combination of local and international staff.

In March 2015, the United Nations Development Group reported that due to a decrease in trade, closing of borders, flight cancellations, and drop in foreign investment and tourism activity fuelled by stigma, the epidemic resulted in vast economic consequences both in the affected areas and throughout Africa.<ref name=\"auto2\" />  A September 2014 report in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' suggested that the economic impact of the Ebola outbreak could kill more people than the disease itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australiannews.net/index.php/sid/225466201|publisher=Australian News.Net|title=IMF says Ebola impacted West African nations may need economic assistance}}</ref>\n\nWith regard to Ebola and economic activity in the country of Liberia, a study found that 8% of automotive firms, 8% of construction firms, 15% of food businesses and 30% of restaurants had closed due to the Ebola outbreak. Montserrado county experienced up to 20% firm closure. This indicated a decline in the Liberian national economy during the outbreak, as well as an indication that the county of Montserrado was hardest hit economically. The capital city Monrovia suffered construction and restaurant unemployment the most, while outside the capital, the food and beverage sectors suffered economically. A recuperation in the economy, at the end of the outbreak, was expected to be more rapid in some sectors than in others. Also, if the massive decline in economic activity persisted, the authors suggested a focus on economic recovery in addition to support for the healthcare system. The [[World Bank]] had projected an estimated loss of $1.6 billion in productivity for all three affected Western African countries combined for 2015. In Liberian counties that were less affected by the outbreak, the number of individuals employed fell by 24%. Montserrado saw a 47% decline in employment per firm in contrast to what was obtained prior to the Ebola outbreak.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://jech.bmj.com/content/early/2015/10/05/jech-2015-205959.full|title=Ebola, jobs and economic activity in Liberia|journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health|volume=70|issue=3|pages=271\u2013277|author=Jeremy Bowles|accessdate=27 January 2016|doi=10.1136/jech-2015-205959|pmid=26438188|pmc=4789821|year=2016}}</ref>\n\nAnother study showed that the economic effect of the Ebola outbreak would be felt for years due to preexisting [[social vulnerability]]. The economic effects were being felt nationwide in Liberia, such as the termination of expansions in the mining business.

In spite of the end of civil violence since 2003 and inflows from international donors, the reconstruction of Liberia had been very slow and non-productive\u2014water delivery systems, sanitation facilities and centralised electricity were practically non-existent, even in Monrovia. Even before the outbreak, medical facilities did not have potable water, lighting or refrigeration.

Their recommendations were published in the November issue of ''[[The Lancet]]''.  According to the panel, the epidemic had exposed problems in the national (and international) institutions responsible for protecting the public from the human consequences of infectious disease outbreaks such as the Ebola epidemic.  The panel was highly critical of the WHO's management of the Ebola crisis noting that it took them months to respond and when they did they were slow to act, poorly co-ordinated and inadequately informed.  The report pointed out that the committee responsible for checking the WHO's actions during the outbreak (i.e. the WHO Ebola Interim Assessment Panel) had delayed responses due to worries about political resistance from the Western African leaders, economic consequences, and a system within the WHO that discouraged open debate about issues such as emergency declarations. The WHO may also have hesitated because it was criticised for creating panic by declaring a public health emergency during the relatively mild [[2009 H1N1 pandemic]]. This, the report states, showed the risks in having such consequential decision-making power in one individual\u2014a risk made worse when there was no mechanism of responsibility for such leadership failure.<ref name=\"lancet\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)00946-0/abstract|title=Will Ebola change the game?

Included in the recommendations of the changes needed to fight future outbreaks is the creation of a U.N. Security Council health committee to expedite political attention to health issues and the establishment of a global fund to finance and accelerate the development of outbreak-relevant drugs and treatment.  The report also noted that competent governance of the global system demanded political leadership and a WHO that is more focused and appropriately financed and whose integrity is restored through the application of adequate reforms and leadership.<ref name=\"lancet\"/>\n\nThe WHO also came under fire for refusing to send Dr. Olivet Buck to Germany for experimental treatment after she contracted Ebola per the government of Sierra Leone's request. WHO claimed they could only evacuate medical professionals they had deployed to the region, not locals. Dr. Olivet Buck was the Medical Superintendent at Lumley Government Hospital in Freetown, Sierra Leone. It's believed that she contracted the virus while continuing to treat patients even during a shortage of personal protective equipment. Her loyalty and dedication to her community never wavered.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Green |first1=Andrew |title=Remembering health workers who died from Ebola in 2014 |journal=The Lancet |date=20 December 2014 |volume=384 |issue=9961 |pages=2201\u20132206 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)62417-X |pmid=25625389 |url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(14)62417-X/fulltext |accessdate=29 February 2020 |language=English |issn=0140-6736}}</ref>\n\n== Timeline of reported cases and deaths ==\n\n{{Main|West African Ebola virus epidemic timeline of reported cases and deaths}}\n{{See also|Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa timeline}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; width:100%;\"\n|+Major Ebola virus outbreaks by country and by date \u2013 to most recent WHO / Gov update- 14 January 2016<br />\n!

The pain is symmetrical and more pronounced in the morning, with the larger joints most affected. There is also possible periarticular [[tenosynovitis]] affecting the shoulders. The WHO guidelines advise to distinguish non-inflammatory [[arthralgia]] from inflammatory [[arthritis]]. With regard to ocular problems, sensitivity to light and blurry vision have been indicated among survivors. Among the aftereffects of Ebola virus disease, uveitis and optic nerve disease could appear after an individual is discharged. Ocular problems could threaten sight in survivors, thus the need for prompt treatment. In treating such individuals, the WHO recommends urgent intervention if uveitis is suspected; this consists mainly of prednisone (a [[corticosteroid]]). Hearing loss has been reported in Ebola survivors 25% of the time.

In March 2015, the CDC interviewed the survivors; they all reported having had at least one adverse symptom during their recovery period. The symptoms ranged from mild (e.g. hair loss) to more severe complications requiring re-hospitalisation or treatment. The most frequently reported symptoms were lethargy or fatigue, joint pain, and hair loss. Sixty-three per cent reported having eye problems including two who were diagnosed with uveitis, 75% reported psychological or cognitive symptoms, and 38% reported neural difficulties. Although most symptoms resolved or improved over time, only one survivor reported complete resolution of all symptoms.<ref name=\"New England Journal of Medicine\">{{cite journal| title=Post-Ebola Signs and Symptoms in U.S. Survivors | journal=New England Journal of Medicine | date=17 December 2015 | doi=10.1056/NEJMc1506576 | pmid=26672870 | volume=373 | issue=25 | pages=2484\u20132486|last1 = Epstein|first1 = Lauren| last2=Wong | first2=Karen K | last3=Kallen | first3=Alexander J | last4=Uyeki | first4=Timothy M }}</ref>\n\nA study published in May 2015 discussed the case of Ian Crozier, a Zimbabwe-born physician and American citizen who became infected with Ebola while he was working at an Ebola treatment centre in Sierra Leone.

However, after discharge Crozier began to experience symptoms including low back pain, bilateral [[enthesitis]] of the [[Achilles tendon]], [[paresthesias]] involving his lower legs, and eye pain, which was diagnosed as uveitis.  His eye condition worsened and a specimen of [[aqueous humor]] obtained from his eye tested positive for Ebola.

In March 2015, the United Nations Development Group reported that due to a decrease in trade, closing of borders, flight cancellations, and drop in foreign investment and tourism activity fuelled by stigma, the epidemic resulted in vast economic consequences both in the affected areas and throughout Africa.<ref name=\"auto2\" />  A September 2014 report in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' suggested that the economic impact of the Ebola outbreak could kill more people than the disease itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australiannews.net/index.php/sid/225466201|publisher=Australian News.Net|title=IMF says Ebola impacted West African nations may need economic assistance}}</ref>\n\nWith regard to Ebola and economic activity in the country of Liberia, a study found that 8% of automotive firms, 8% of construction firms, 15% of food businesses and 30% of restaurants had closed due to the Ebola outbreak. Montserrado county experienced up to 20% firm closure. This indicated a decline in the Liberian national economy during the outbreak, as well as an indication that the county of Montserrado was hardest hit economically. The capital city Monrovia suffered construction and restaurant unemployment the most, while outside the capital, the food and beverage sectors suffered economically. A recuperation in the economy, at the end of the outbreak, was expected to be more rapid in some sectors than in others. Also, if the massive decline in economic activity persisted, the authors suggested a focus on economic recovery in addition to support for the healthcare system. The [[World Bank]] had projected an estimated loss of $1.6 billion in productivity for all three affected Western African countries combined for 2015. In Liberian counties that were less affected by the outbreak, the number of individuals employed fell by 24%. Montserrado saw a 47% decline in employment per firm in contrast to what was obtained prior to the Ebola outbreak.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://jech.bmj.com/content/early/2015/10/05/jech-2015-205959.full|title=Ebola, jobs and economic activity in Liberia|journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health|volume=70|issue=3|pages=271\u2013277|author=Jeremy Bowles|accessdate=27 January 2016|doi=10.1136/jech-2015-205959|pmid=26438188|pmc=4789821|year=2016}}</ref>\n\nAnother study showed that the economic effect of the Ebola outbreak would be felt for years due to preexisting [[social vulnerability]]. The economic effects were being felt nationwide in Liberia, such as the termination of expansions in the mining business.

In spite of the end of civil violence since 2003 and inflows from international donors, the reconstruction of Liberia had been very slow and non-productive\u2014water delivery systems, sanitation facilities and centralised electricity were practically non-existent, even in Monrovia. Even before the outbreak, medical facilities did not have potable water, lighting or refrigeration.

Their recommendations were published in the November issue of ''[[The Lancet]]''.  According to the panel, the epidemic had exposed problems in the national (and international) institutions responsible for protecting the public from the human consequences of infectious disease outbreaks such as the Ebola epidemic.  The panel was highly critical of the WHO's management of the Ebola crisis noting that it took them months to respond and when they did they were slow to act, poorly co-ordinated and inadequately informed.  The report pointed out that the committee responsible for checking the WHO's actions during the outbreak (i.e. the WHO Ebola Interim Assessment Panel) had delayed responses due to worries about political resistance from the Western African leaders, economic consequences, and a system within the WHO that discouraged open debate about issues such as emergency declarations. The WHO may also have hesitated because it was criticised for creating panic by declaring a public health emergency during the relatively mild [[2009 H1N1 pandemic]]. This, the report states, showed the risks in having such consequential decision-making power in one individual\u2014a risk made worse when there was no mechanism of responsibility for such leadership failure.<ref name=\"lancet\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)00946-0/abstract|title=Will Ebola change the game?

Included in the recommendations of the changes needed to fight future outbreaks is the creation of a U.N. Security Council health committee to expedite political attention to health issues and the establishment of a global fund to finance and accelerate the development of outbreak-relevant drugs and treatment.  The report also noted that competent governance of the global system demanded political leadership and a WHO that is more focused and appropriately financed and whose integrity is restored through the application of adequate reforms and leadership.<ref name=\"lancet\"/>\n\nThe WHO also came under fire for refusing to send Dr. Olivet Buck to Germany for experimental treatment after she contracted Ebola per the government of Sierra Leone's request. WHO claimed they could only evacuate medical professionals they had deployed to the region, not locals. Dr. Olivet Buck was the Medical Superintendent at Lumley Government Hospital in Freetown, Sierra Leone. It's believed that she contracted the virus while continuing to treat patients even during a shortage of personal protective equipment.

[[Social skills]], behavioral skills, and someone's way of thinking are just some of the things that the human brain develops at an early age. Learning how to interact with others and how to focus on certain subjects are essential lessons to learn. This starts from the time we can talk all the way to when we are so old that we can barely walk. However, there are some people in society who have difficulty with these kind of skills and behaving like an average person. This is most likely the cause of having a mental illness. A mental illness consist of a wide range of conditions that affects a person's mood, thinking, and behavior. About 26% of people in the United States, ages 18 and older, have been diagnosed with some kind of mental disorder. However, not much is said about children with mental illnesses even though there are many that will develop one, even as early as age three.\n\nThe most common mental illnesses in children include, but are not limited to [[anxiety disorder]], as well as [[Depression in childhood and adolescence|depression]] in older children and teens. Having a mental illness at a younger age is much different from having one in your thirties.

Parents are sometimes held responsible for their child's own illness.<ref name=\"Hinshaw, Stephen P 2005\"/> People also say that the parents raised their children in a certain way or they acquired their behavior from them. Family and friends are sometimes so ashamed of the idea of being close to someone with a disorder that the child feels isolated and thinks that they have to hide their illness from others.<ref name=\"Hinshaw, Stephen P 2005\"/> When in reality, hiding it from people prevents the child from getting the right amount of social interaction and treatment in order to thrive in today's society.\n\n[[Social stigma|Stigma]] is also a well-known factor in mental illness.

In an article written by Lisa Godman and her colleagues, they reference Smith\u2019s research on the prevance of PTSD among homeless people. His research stated \u201c Homelessness itself is a risk factor for emotional disorder\u201d. What this quote is saying is that being homeless itself can cause emotional disorder. Without looking for other reasons for emotional disorder and really looking at the simple fact that an individual is homeless can cause emotional disorder. Godman\u2019s article stated \u201cRecently, Smith ( 1991) investigated the prevalence of PTSD among a sample of 300 randomly selected homeless single women and mothers in St. Louis, Mis- souri. Using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS; Robins, 1981; Robins & Helzer, 1984), she found that 53% of the respondents could be diagnosed as exhibiting full-blown cases of PTSD\u201d. As the source explains, the conclusion that was drawn from Smith\u2019s investigation after studying 300 homeless individuals is that 53% of those people were eligible to be diagnosed with PTSD. She continues and states\u201c In addition, data from clinical observations, self-reports, and empirical studies suggest that at least two commonly reported symptoms of psychological trauma, social disaffiliation and learned helplessness are highly prevalent among homeless individuals and families.\u201d Other datas were able to prove that PTSD and learned helplessness were two symptoms that were very much present among homeless individuals and families.

It states \u201cFor homeless people with mental illness, case management linked to other services was effective in improving psychiatric symptoms, and assertive case management was effective in decreasing psychiatric hospitalizations and increasing outpatient contacts. For homeless people with substance abuse problems, case management resulted in greater decreases in substance use than did usual care\u201d. The question would be how are these people being helped.

Despite modern treatment and rehabilitation for emotional mental health disorders, \"even economically advantaged societies have competing priorities and budgetary constraints\".\n\nThe World Mental Health survey initiative has suggested a plan for countries to redesign their mental health care systems to best allocate resources. \n\"A first step is documentation of services being used and the extent and nature of unmet needs for treatment. A second step could be to do a cross-national comparison of service use and unmet needs in countries with different mental health care systems. Such comparisons can help to uncover optimum financing, national policies, and delivery systems for mental health care.\"\n\nKnowledge of how to provide effective emotional mental health care has become imperative worldwide. Unfortunately, most countries have insufficient data to guide decisions, absent or competing visions for resources, and near constant pressures to cut insurance and entitlements. WMH surveys were done in Africa ([[Nigeria]], South Africa), the Americas (Colombia, Mexico, United States), Asia and the Pacific ([[Japan]], [[New Zealand]], [[Beijing]] and [[Shanghai]] in the [[China|People's Republic of China]]), Europe (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Ukraine), and the middle east (Israel, Lebanon). Countries were classified with [[World Bank]] criteria as [[Low income|low-income]] ([[Nigeria]]), lower middle-income ([[China]], [[Colombia]], [[South Africa]], [[Ukraine]]), higher middle-income ([[Lebanon]], [[Mexico]]), and high-income.\n\nThe coordinated surveys on emotional mental health disorders, their severity, and treatments were implemented in the aforementioned countries. These surveys assessed the frequency, types, and adequacy of mental health service use in 17 countries in which WMH surveys are complete. The WMH also examined unmet needs for treatment in strata defined by the seriousness of mental disorders. Their research showed that \"the number of respondents using any 12-month mental health service was generally lower in developing than in developed countries, and the proportion receiving services tended to correspond to countries' percentages of [[gross domestic product]] spent on health care\".\n\"High levels of unmet need worldwide are not surprising, since [[WHO]] Project [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]]' findings of much lower mental health expenditures than was suggested by the magnitude of burdens from mental illnesses. Generally, unmet needs in [[low-income]] and [[middle-income]] countries might be attributable to these nations spending reduced amounts (usually <1%) of already diminished health budgets on mental health care, and they rely heavily on out-of-pocket spending by citizens who are ill-equipped for it\".\n\n==Treatment==\n\n===Older methods of treatment===\n\n=== Trepanation ===\n\nArchaeological records have shown that [[trepanation]] was a procedure used to treat \"headaches, insanities or [[epilepsy]]\" in several parts of the world in the Stone age. It was a surgical process used in the [[Stone Age]]. [[Paul Broca]] studied trepanation and came up with his own theory on it. He noticed that the fractures on the skulls dug up weren't caused by wounds inflicted due to violence, but because of careful surgical procedures. \"Doctors used sharpened stones to scrape the skull and drill holes into the head of the patient\" to allow evil spirits which plagued the patient to escape. There were several patients that died in these procedures, but those that survived were revered and believed to possess \"properties of a mystical order\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mentalillness.umwblogs.org/stone-age/trepanation/|title=Trepanation - Treatment of the Mentally Ill}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wisNNoceOzoC&pg=PA243&lpg=PA243&dq=kidd+1946+trepanation#v=onepage&q=kidd+1946+trepanation&f=false|title=Trepanation|first1=Robert|last1=Arnott|first2=Stanley|last2=Finger|first3=Chris|last3=Smith|date=26 September 2005|publisher=CRC Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780203970942}}</ref>\n\n===Lobotomy===\n\n[[Lobotomy]] was used in the 20th century as a common practice of alternative treatment for mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and depression.

This programme is considered as the seed of origin of psychosocial rehabilitation in India.\n\nBerkeley-Hill, superintendent of the European Hospital (now known as the [[Central Institute of Psychiatry|Central Institute of Psychiatry (CIP)]], established in 1918), was deeply concerned about the improvement of mental hospitals in those days. The sustained efforts of Berkeley-Hill helped to raise the standard of treatment and care and he also persuaded the government to change the term 'asylum' to 'hospital' in 1920.<ref>Harrison, 1994{{full citation needed|date=November 2019}}</ref> Techniques similar to the current token-economy were first started in 1920 and called by the name 'habit formation chart' at the CIP, Ranchi.

In Amritsar Dr. Vidyasagar, instituted active involvement of families in the care of persons with mental illness. This was advanced practice ahead of its times regarding treatment and care. This methodology had a greater impact on social work practice in the mental health field especially in reducing the stigmatisation. In 1948 Gauri Rani Banerjee, trained in the United States, started a master's course in medical and psychiatric social work at the Dhorabji Tata School of Social Work (Now TISS). Later the first trained psychiatric social worker was appointed in 1949 at the adult psychiatry unit of Yervada mental hospital, Pune.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn various parts of the country, in mental health service settings, social workers were employed\u2014in 1956 at a mental hospital in Amritsar, in 1958 at a child guidance clinic of the college of nursing, and in Delhi in 1960 at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and in 1962 at the [[Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital]]. In 1960, the Madras Mental Hospital (Now [[Institute of Mental Health (Chennai)|Institute of Mental Health]]), employed social workers to bridge the gap between doctors and patients. In 1961 the social work post was created at the NIMHANS. In these settings they took care of the psychosocial aspect of treatment. This system enabled social service practices to have a stronger long-term impact on mental health care.<ref>Dr. Ratna Varma, Psychiatric Social Work in India{{full citation needed|date=November 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966 by the recommendation Mental Health Advisory Committee, Ministry of Health, Government of India, NIMHANS commenced Department of Psychiatric Social Work started and a two-year Postgraduate Diploma in Psychiatric Social Work was introduced in 1968. In 1978, the nomenclature of the course was changed to MPhil in Psychiatric Social Work. Subsequently, a PhD Programme was introduced.

Rising death tolls due to mental illness demonstrate the imperative need for improved mental health care policies and advances in treatment for Africans suffering from psychological disorders.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nUnderdeveloped African countries are so visibly troubled by physical illnesses, disease, malnutrition, and contamination that the dilemma of lacking mental health care has not been prioritized, makes it challenging to have a recognized impact on the African population. In 1988 and 1990, two original resolutions were implemented by the World Health Organization's Member States in Africa. AFR/RC39/R1 and AFR/RC40/R9 attempted to improve the status of mental health care in specific African regions to combat its growing effects on the African people.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Gureje|first=O.|date=2000|title=Mental Health Policy Development in Africa|url=https://www.who.int/bulletin/archives/78(4)475.pdf|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=78|issue=4|pages=475\u2013482|via=World Health Organization|pmid=10885166|pmc=2560723}}</ref> However, it was found that these new policies had little impact on the status of mental health in Africa, ultimately resulting in an incline in psychological disorders instead of the desired decline, and causing this to seem like an impossible problem to manage.\n\nIn Africa, there are many socio-cultural and biological factors that have led to heightened psychological struggles, while also masking their immediate level of importance to the African eye. Increasing rates of unemployment, violence, crime, rape, and disease are often linked to substance abuse, which can cause mental illness rates to inflate.<ref name=\"un.org\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/december-2016-march-2017/mental-illness-invisible-devastating|title=Mental illness: Invisible but devastating {{!}} Africa Renewal|website=www.un.org|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref> Additionally, physical disease like HIV/AIDS, the Ebola epidemic, and malaria often have lasting psychological effects on victims that go unrecognized in African communities because of their inherent cultural beliefs. Traditional African beliefs have led to the perception of mental illness as being caused by supernatural forces, preventing helpful or rational responses to abnormal behavior. For example, Ebola received loads of media attention when it became rampant in Africa and eventually spread to the US, however, researchers never really paid attention to its psychological effects on the African brain. Extreme anxiety, struggles with grief, feelings of rejection and incompetence, depression leading to suicide, PTSD, and much more are only some of the noted effects of diseases like Ebola.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reardon|first=Sara|date=March 2016|title=Ebola's Mental-Health Wounds Linger in Africa|journal=Nature|volume=519|issue=7541|pages=13\u201314|doi=10.1038/519013a|pmid=25739606|id={{ProQuest|1662365135}}}}</ref> These epidemics come and go, but their lasting effects on mental health are remaining for years to come, and even ending lives because of the lack of action. There has been some effort to financially fund psychiatric support in countries like Liberia, due to its dramatic mental health crisis after warfare, but not much was benefited. Aside from financial reasons, it is so difficult to enforce mental health interventions and manage mental health in general in underdeveloped countries simply because the individuals living there do not necessarily believe in western psychiatry. It is also important to note that the socio-cultural model of psychology and abnormal behavior is dependent on factors surrounding cultural differences.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Essentials of Understanding Abnormal Behavior|last=Sue|first=David|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2017|isbn=978-1-305-65851-6|location=Boston, MA|pages=7}}</ref> This causes mental health abnormalities to remain more hidden due to the culture's natural behavior, compared to westernized behavior and cultural norms.\n\nThis relationship between mental and physical illness is an ongoing cycle that has yet to be broken. While there are many organizations attempting to solve problems pertaining to physical health in Africa, as these problems are clearly visible and recognizable, there is little action taken to confront the underlying mental effects that are left on the victims. It is recognized that many of the mentally ill in Africa search for help from spiritual or religious leaders, however this is widely due to the fact that many African countries are significantly lacking in mental health professionals in comparison to the rest of the world. In Ethiopia alone, there are \u201conly 10 psychiatrists for the population of 61 million people,\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> studies have shown. While numbers have definitely changed since this research was done, the lack of psychological professionals throughout African continues with a current average of 1.4 mental health workers per 100,000 people compared to the global statistic of 9.0 professionals per 100,00 people.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal |last1=Sankoh |first1=Osman |last2=Sevalie |first2=Stephen |last3=Weston |first3=Mark |title=Mental health in Africa |journal=The Lancet Global Health |date=September 2018 |volume=6 |issue=9 |pages=e954\u2013e955 |doi=10.1016/S2214-109X(18)30303-6 |pmid=30103990 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Additionally, statistics show that the \u201cglobal annual rate of visits to mental health outpatient facilities is 1,051 per 100,000 population,\u201d while \u201cin Africa the rate is 14 per 100,000\u201d visits.

The ''Lancet Global Health''<ref name=\"Jacob 1061\u20131077\"/> acknowledges that there are well over 1,000 published articles covering physical health in Africa, but there are still less than 50 discussing mental health. And this pressing dilemma of prioritizing physical health vs. mental health is only worsening as the continent's population is substantially growing with research showing that \u201cBetween 2000 and 2015 the continent's population grew by 49%, yet the number of years lost to disability as a result of mental and substance use disorders increased by 52%\u201d.<ref name=\":2\" /> The number of deaths caused by mental instability is truly competing with those caused by physical diseases: \u201cIn 2015, 17.9 million years were lost to disability as a consequence of mental health problems. Such disorders were almost as important a cause of years lost to disability as were infectious and parasitic diseases, which accounted for 18.5 million years lost to disability,\u201d.<ref name=\":2\" /> Mental health and physical health care, while they may seem separate, are very much connected, as these two factors determine life or death for humans. As new challenges surface and old challenges still haven't been prioritized, Africa's mental health care policies need significant improvement in order to provide its people with the appropriate health care they deserve, hopefully preventing this problem from expanding.\n\n===Australia===\nA survey conducted by [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] in 2008 regarding adults with manageable to severe neurosis reveals almost half of the population had a mental disorder at some point of their life and one in five people had a sustained disorder in the preceding 12 months.

There were distinct gender differences in disposition to mental health illness.

The program stressed the importance of other supports in addition to medical care, including housing, living expenses, employment, transportation, and education; and set up new national priority for people with serious mental disorders. In addition, the Congress enacted the [[Mental Health Systems Act of 1980]] to prioritize the service to the mentally ill and emphasize the expansion of services beyond just clinical care alone.<ref name=\"Koyanagi, C. 2007\">{{citation |last1=Koyanagi |first1=Chris |date=August 2007 |title=Learning From History: Deinstitutionalization of People with Mental Illness As Precursor to Long-Term Care Reform |publisher=[[Kaiser Family Foundation]] |location=Menlo Park, CA |pages=1\u201322 |url=https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/7684.pdf }}</ref> Later in the 1980s, under the influence from the Congress and the Supreme Court, many programs started to help the patients regain their benefits. A new Medicaid service was also established to serve people who were diagnosed with a \"chronic mental illness.\" People who were temporally hospitalized were also provided aid and care and a pre-release program was created to enable people to apply for reinstatement prior to discharge.<ref name=\"Koyanagi, C. 1991 p.899-905\"/> Not until 1990, around 35 years after the start of the deinstitutionalization, did the first state hospital begin to close. The number of hospitals dropped from around 300 by over 40 in the 1990s, and finally a Report on Mental Health showed the efficacy of mental health treatment, giving a range of treatments available for patients to choose.<ref name=\"Koyanagi, C. 2007\"/>\n\nHowever, several critics maintain that deinstitutionalization has, from a mental health point of view, been a thoroughgoing failure. The seriously mentally ill are either homeless, or in prison; in either case (especially the latter), they are getting little or no mental health care. This failure is attributed to a number of reasons over which there is some degree of contention, although there is general agreement that community support programs have been ineffective at best, due to a lack of funding.<ref name=Torrey_Book/>\n\nThe 2011 National Prevention Strategy included mental and emotional well-being, with recommendations including better parenting and early intervention programs, which increase the likelihood of prevention programs being included in future US mental health policies.<ref name=\":0\">{{citation |author=National Prevention Council |date=16 June 2011 |title=National Prevention Strategy |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Surgeon General |location=Washington, DC |url=http://www.healthcare.gov/prevention/nphpphc/strategy/report.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004043040/http://www.healthcare.gov/prevention/nphpphc/strategy/report.pdf |archive-date=4 October 2011 }}</ref>{{page needed |date=January 2016}} The [[National Institute of Mental Health|NIMH]] is researching only suicide and [[HIV/AIDS]] prevention, but the National Prevention Strategy could lead to it focusing more broadly on longitudinal prevention studies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Prevention of Mental Disorders|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/prevention-of-mental-disorders/index.shtml|website=National Institute of Mental Health|publisher=National Institute of Mental Health|accessdate=7 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705041918/https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/prevention-of-mental-disorders/index.shtml |archive-date=5 July 2015 }}{{Failed verification |reason=Source contains a list of publications.

[[Social skills]], behavioral skills, and someone's way of thinking are just some of the things that the human brain develops at an early age. Learning how to interact with others and how to focus on certain subjects are essential lessons to learn. This starts from the time we can talk all the way to when we are so old that we can barely walk. However, there are some people in society who have difficulty with these kind of skills and behaving like an average person. This is most likely the cause of having a mental illness. A mental illness consist of a wide range of conditions that affects a person's mood, thinking, and behavior. About 26% of people in the United States, ages 18 and older, have been diagnosed with some kind of mental disorder. However, not much is said about children with mental illnesses even though there are many that will develop one, even as early as age three.\n\nThe most common mental illnesses in children include, but are not limited to [[anxiety disorder]], as well as [[Depression in childhood and adolescence|depression]] in older children and teens. Having a mental illness at a younger age is much different from having one in your thirties.

Parents are sometimes held responsible for their child's own illness.<ref name=\"Hinshaw, Stephen P 2005\"/> People also say that the parents raised their children in a certain way or they acquired their behavior from them. Family and friends are sometimes so ashamed of the idea of being close to someone with a disorder that the child feels isolated and thinks that they have to hide their illness from others.<ref name=\"Hinshaw, Stephen P 2005\"/> When in reality, hiding it from people prevents the child from getting the right amount of social interaction and treatment in order to thrive in today's society.\n\n[[Social stigma|Stigma]] is also a well-known factor in mental illness. Stigma is defined as \u201ca mark of disgrace associated with a particular circumstance, quality, or person.\u201d Stigma is used especially when it comes to the mentally disabled.

This study found that browsing websites related to suicide, and methods used to commit suicide, had a negative effect on suicidal thoughts and increased depression and anxiety tendencies.

In an article written by Lisa Godman and her colleagues, they reference Smith\u2019s research on the prevance of PTSD among homeless people. His research stated \u201c Homelessness itself is a risk factor for emotional disorder\u201d. What this quote is saying is that being homeless itself can cause emotional disorder. Without looking for other reasons for emotional disorder and really looking at the simple fact that an individual is homeless can cause emotional disorder. Godman\u2019s article stated \u201cRecently, Smith ( 1991) investigated the prevalence of PTSD among a sample of 300 randomly selected homeless single women and mothers in St. Louis, Mis- souri. Using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS; Robins, 1981; Robins & Helzer, 1984), she found that 53% of the respondents could be diagnosed as exhibiting full-blown cases of PTSD\u201d. As the source explains, the conclusion that was drawn from Smith\u2019s investigation after studying 300 homeless individuals is that 53% of those people were eligible to be diagnosed with PTSD. She continues and states\u201c In addition, data from clinical observations, self-reports, and empirical studies suggest that at least two commonly reported symptoms of psychological trauma, social disaffiliation and learned helplessness are highly prevalent among homeless individuals and families.\u201d Other datas were able to prove that PTSD and learned helplessness were two symptoms that were very much present among homeless individuals and families.

It states \u201cFor homeless people with mental illness, case management linked to other services was effective in improving psychiatric symptoms, and assertive case management was effective in decreasing psychiatric hospitalizations and increasing outpatient contacts. For homeless people with substance abuse problems, case management resulted in greater decreases in substance use than did usual care\u201d. The question would be how are these people being helped.

Care navigators work closely with patients and families through discussion and collaboration to provide information on best therapies as well as referrals to practitioners and facilities specializing in particular forms of emotional improvement. The difference between therapy and care navigation is that the care navigation process provides information and directs patients to therapy rather than providing therapy. Still, care navigators may offer diagnosis and treatment planning. Though many care navigators are also trained therapists and doctors. Care navigation is the link between the patient and the below therapies. A clear recognition that mental health requires medical intervention was demonstrated in a study by Kessler et al. of the prevalence and treatment of mental disorders from 1990 to 2003 in the United States. Despite the prevalence of mental health disorders remaining unchanged during this period, the number of patients seeking treatment for mental disorders increased threefold.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Kessler|first1=Ronald C. |last2=Demler|first2=Olga |last3=Frank|first3=Richard G. |last4=Olfson|first4=Mark |last5=Pincus|first5=Harold Alan |last6=Walters|first6=Ellen E. |last7=Wang|first7=Philip |last8=Wells|first8=Kenneth B. |last9=Zaslavsky|first9=Alan M. |title=Prevalence and Treatment of Mental Disorders, 1990 to 2003 |date=16 June 2005 |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=352 |issue=24 |pages=2515\u20132523 |doi= 10.1056/nejmsa043266|pmid=15958807 |pmc=2847367 }}</ref>\n\n==Emotional issues==\n[[File:The prevalence of mental illness is higher in more unequal rich countries.jpg|thumb|The prevalence of mental illness is higher in more [[economic inequality|unequal]] rich countries|alt=|left]]Emotional mental disorders are a leading cause of disabilities worldwide.

Despite modern treatment and rehabilitation for emotional mental health disorders, \"even economically advantaged societies have competing priorities and budgetary constraints\".\n\nThe World Mental Health survey initiative has suggested a plan for countries to redesign their mental health care systems to best allocate resources. \n\"A first step is documentation of services being used and the extent and nature of unmet needs for treatment. A second step could be to do a cross-national comparison of service use and unmet needs in countries with different mental health care systems. Such comparisons can help to uncover optimum financing, national policies, and delivery systems for mental health care.\"\n\nKnowledge of how to provide effective emotional mental health care has become imperative worldwide. Unfortunately, most countries have insufficient data to guide decisions, absent or competing visions for resources, and near constant pressures to cut insurance and entitlements. WMH surveys were done in Africa ([[Nigeria]], South Africa), the Americas (Colombia, Mexico, United States), Asia and the Pacific ([[Japan]], [[New Zealand]], [[Beijing]] and [[Shanghai]] in the [[China|People's Republic of China]]), Europe (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Ukraine), and the middle east (Israel, Lebanon). Countries were classified with [[World Bank]] criteria as [[Low income|low-income]] ([[Nigeria]]), lower middle-income ([[China]], [[Colombia]], [[South Africa]], [[Ukraine]]), higher middle-income ([[Lebanon]], [[Mexico]]), and high-income.\n\nThe coordinated surveys on emotional mental health disorders, their severity, and treatments were implemented in the aforementioned countries. These surveys assessed the frequency, types, and adequacy of mental health service use in 17 countries in which WMH surveys are complete. The WMH also examined unmet needs for treatment in strata defined by the seriousness of mental disorders. Their research showed that \"the number of respondents using any 12-month mental health service was generally lower in developing than in developed countries, and the proportion receiving services tended to correspond to countries' percentages of [[gross domestic product]] spent on health care\".\n\"High levels of unmet need worldwide are not surprising, since [[WHO]] Project [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]]' findings of much lower mental health expenditures than was suggested by the magnitude of burdens from mental illnesses. Generally, unmet needs in [[low-income]] and [[middle-income]] countries might be attributable to these nations spending reduced amounts (usually <1%) of already diminished health budgets on mental health care, and they rely heavily on out-of-pocket spending by citizens who are ill-equipped for it\".\n\n==Treatment==\n\n===Older methods of treatment===\n\n=== Trepanation ===\n\nArchaeological records have shown that [[trepanation]] was a procedure used to treat \"headaches, insanities or [[epilepsy]]\" in several parts of the world in the Stone age. It was a surgical process used in the [[Stone Age]]. [[Paul Broca]] studied trepanation and came up with his own theory on it. He noticed that the fractures on the skulls dug up weren't caused by wounds inflicted due to violence, but because of careful surgical procedures. \"Doctors used sharpened stones to scrape the skull and drill holes into the head of the patient\" to allow evil spirits which plagued the patient to escape. There were several patients that died in these procedures, but those that survived were revered and believed to possess \"properties of a mystical order\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mentalillness.umwblogs.org/stone-age/trepanation/|title=Trepanation - Treatment of the Mentally Ill}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wisNNoceOzoC&pg=PA243&lpg=PA243&dq=kidd+1946+trepanation#v=onepage&q=kidd+1946+trepanation&f=false|title=Trepanation|first1=Robert|last1=Arnott|first2=Stanley|last2=Finger|first3=Chris|last3=Smith|date=26 September 2005|publisher=CRC Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780203970942}}</ref>\n\n===Lobotomy===\n\n[[Lobotomy]] was used in the 20th century as a common practice of alternative treatment for mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and depression. The first ever modern [[leucotomy]] meant for the purpose of treating a mental illness occurred in 1935 by a Portuguese neurologist, [[Ant\u00f3nio Egas Moniz|Antonio Egas Moniz]]. He received the [[Nobel Prize]] in medicine in 1949. [https://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2011/03/21/the-surprising-history-of-the-lobotomy/]. This belief that mental health illnesses could be treated by surgery came from Swiss neurologist, [[Gottlieb Burckhardt]]. After conducting experiments on six patients with schizophrenia, he claimed that half of his patients recovered or calmed down.\nPsychiatrist [[Walter Jackson Freeman II|Walter Freeman]] believed that \"an overload of emotions led to mental illness and \u201cthat cutting certain nerves in the brain could eliminate excess emotion and stabilize a personality\", according to a [[National Public Radio]] article.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5014565|title=Frequently Asked Questions About Lobotomies|website=NPR.org}}</ref>\n\n===Exorcisms===\n\n\"[[Exorcism]] is the religious or spiritual practice of evicting demons or other spiritual entities from a person, or an area, they are believed to have possessed.\"\n\nMental health illnesses such as [[Huntington's disease|Huntington's Disease]] (HD), [[Tourette syndrome]] and [[schizophrenia]] were believed to be signs of [[Demonic possession|possession]] by the [[Devil]]. This led to several mentally ill patients being subjected to [[exorcism]]s. This practice has been around for a long time, though decreasing steadily until it reached a low in the 18th century. It seldom occurred until the 20th century when the numbers rose due to the attention the media was giving to exorcisms.

In native healing beliefs, health and mental health were inseparable, so similar combinations of natural and spiritual remedies were often employed to relieve both mental and physical illness. These communities and families greatly valued holistic approaches for preventive health care.

One million people commit suicide every year and 10 to 20 million attempt it.<ref>Sowers, Rowe, & Clay, 2009{{full citation needed|date=November 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Africa ===\nMental illnesses and mental health disorders are widespread concerns among underdeveloped African countries, yet these issues are largely neglected, as mental health care in Africa is given statistically less attention than it is in other, westernized nations. Rising death tolls due to mental illness demonstrate the imperative need for improved mental health care policies and advances in treatment for Africans suffering from psychological disorders.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nUnderdeveloped African countries are so visibly troubled by physical illnesses, disease, malnutrition, and contamination that the dilemma of lacking mental health care has not been prioritized, makes it challenging to have a recognized impact on the African population. In 1988 and 1990, two original resolutions were implemented by the World Health Organization's Member States in Africa. AFR/RC39/R1 and AFR/RC40/R9 attempted to improve the status of mental health care in specific African regions to combat its growing effects on the African people.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Gureje|first=O.|date=2000|title=Mental Health Policy Development in Africa|url=https://www.who.int/bulletin/archives/78(4)475.pdf|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=78|issue=4|pages=475\u2013482|via=World Health Organization|pmid=10885166|pmc=2560723}}</ref> However, it was found that these new policies had little impact on the status of mental health in Africa, ultimately resulting in an incline in psychological disorders instead of the desired decline, and causing this to seem like an impossible problem to manage.\n\nIn Africa, there are many socio-cultural and biological factors that have led to heightened psychological struggles, while also masking their immediate level of importance to the African eye. Increasing rates of unemployment, violence, crime, rape, and disease are often linked to substance abuse, which can cause mental illness rates to inflate.<ref name=\"un.org\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/december-2016-march-2017/mental-illness-invisible-devastating|title=Mental illness: Invisible but devastating {{!}} Africa Renewal|website=www.un.org|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref> Additionally, physical disease like HIV/AIDS, the Ebola epidemic, and malaria often have lasting psychological effects on victims that go unrecognized in African communities because of their inherent cultural beliefs. Traditional African beliefs have led to the perception of mental illness as being caused by supernatural forces, preventing helpful or rational responses to abnormal behavior. For example, Ebola received loads of media attention when it became rampant in Africa and eventually spread to the US, however, researchers never really paid attention to its psychological effects on the African brain. Extreme anxiety, struggles with grief, feelings of rejection and incompetence, depression leading to suicide, PTSD, and much more are only some of the noted effects of diseases like Ebola.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reardon|first=Sara|date=March 2016|title=Ebola's Mental-Health Wounds Linger in Africa|journal=Nature|volume=519|issue=7541|pages=13\u201314|doi=10.1038/519013a|pmid=25739606|id={{ProQuest|1662365135}}}}</ref> These epidemics come and go, but their lasting effects on mental health are remaining for years to come, and even ending lives because of the lack of action. There has been some effort to financially fund psychiatric support in countries like Liberia, due to its dramatic mental health crisis after warfare, but not much was benefited. Aside from financial reasons, it is so difficult to enforce mental health interventions and manage mental health in general in underdeveloped countries simply because the individuals living there do not necessarily believe in western psychiatry. It is also important to note that the socio-cultural model of psychology and abnormal behavior is dependent on factors surrounding cultural differences.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Essentials of Understanding Abnormal Behavior|last=Sue|first=David|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2017|isbn=978-1-305-65851-6|location=Boston, MA|pages=7}}</ref> This causes mental health abnormalities to remain more hidden due to the culture's natural behavior, compared to westernized behavior and cultural norms.\n\nThis relationship between mental and physical illness is an ongoing cycle that has yet to be broken. While there are many organizations attempting to solve problems pertaining to physical health in Africa, as these problems are clearly visible and recognizable, there is little action taken to confront the underlying mental effects that are left on the victims. It is recognized that many of the mentally ill in Africa search for help from spiritual or religious leaders, however this is widely due to the fact that many African countries are significantly lacking in mental health professionals in comparison to the rest of the world. In Ethiopia alone, there are \u201conly 10 psychiatrists for the population of 61 million people,\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> studies have shown. While numbers have definitely changed since this research was done, the lack of psychological professionals throughout African continues with a current average of 1.4 mental health workers per 100,000 people compared to the global statistic of 9.0 professionals per 100,00 people.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal |last1=Sankoh |first1=Osman |last2=Sevalie |first2=Stephen |last3=Weston |first3=Mark |title=Mental health in Africa |journal=The Lancet Global Health |date=September 2018 |volume=6 |issue=9 |pages=e954\u2013e955 |doi=10.1016/S2214-109X(18)30303-6 |pmid=30103990 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Additionally, statistics show that the \u201cglobal annual rate of visits to mental health outpatient facilities is 1,051 per 100,000 population,\u201d while \u201cin Africa the rate is 14 per 100,000\u201d visits.

The ''Lancet Global Health''<ref name=\"Jacob 1061\u20131077\"/> acknowledges that there are well over 1,000 published articles covering physical health in Africa, but there are still less than 50 discussing mental health. And this pressing dilemma of prioritizing physical health vs. mental health is only worsening as the continent's population is substantially growing with research showing that \u201cBetween 2000 and 2015 the continent's population grew by 49%, yet the number of years lost to disability as a result of mental and substance use disorders increased by 52%\u201d.<ref name=\":2\" /> The number of deaths caused by mental instability is truly competing with those caused by physical diseases: \u201cIn 2015, 17.9 million years were lost to disability as a consequence of mental health problems.

As new challenges surface and old challenges still haven't been prioritized, Africa's mental health care policies need significant improvement in order to provide its people with the appropriate health care they deserve, hopefully preventing this problem from expanding.\n\n===Australia===\nA survey conducted by [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] in 2008 regarding adults with manageable to severe neurosis reveals almost half of the population had a mental disorder at some point of their life and one in five people had a sustained disorder in the preceding 12 months. In neurotic disorders, 14% of the population experienced anxiety and comorbidity disorders were next to common mental disorder with vulnerability to substance abuse and relapses. There were distinct gender differences in disposition to mental health illness. Women were found to have high rate of mental health disorders, and Men had higher propensity of risk for substance abuse. The SMHWB survey showed families that had low socioeconomic status and high dysfunctional patterns had a greater proportional risk for mental health disorders. A 2010 survey regarding adults with psychosis revealed 5 persons per 1000 in the population seeks professional mental health services for [[psychotic disorders]] and the most common psychotic disorder was [[schizophrenia]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Ruth Elder|author2=Katie Evans|author3=Debra Nizette|title=Psychiatric & Mental Health Nursing|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jpnzp7D64XcC|year=2012|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-7295-8098-4|chapter=Mental Health and Illness in Australia and New Zealand}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Mental health services and the integration of employment support in Australia|year=2015|issn=2225-7977|doi=10.1787/9789264246591-en|series=Mental Health and Work|isbn=9789264246584}}</ref>\n\n===Canada===\nAccording to statistics released by the Centre of Addiction and Mental Health one in five people in [[Canada]] experience a mental health or addiction problem.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Mental Health Commission of Canada Releases Guidelines for Comprehensive Mental Health Services for Older Adults in Canada|date=2011|doi = 10.1037/e505332013-001}}</ref> Young people ages 15 to 25 are particularly vulnerable.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} Major depression is found to affect 8% and anxiety disorder 12% of the population.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} Women are 1.5 times more likely to suffer from mood and anxiety disorders.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} WHO points out that there are distinct gender differences in patterns of mental health and illness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/gender/other_health/genderMH.pdf|title=Gender and Mental Health|last=|first=|date=June 2002|website=World Health Organization|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The lack of power and control over their socioeconomic status, gender based violence; low social position and responsibility for the care of others render women vulnerable to mental health risks.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} Since more women than men seek help regarding a mental health problem, this has led to not only gender stereotyping but also reinforcing social stigma.

The number of hospitals dropped from around 300 by over 40 in the 1990s, and finally a Report on Mental Health showed the efficacy of mental health treatment, giving a range of treatments available for patients to choose.<ref name=\"Koyanagi, C. 2007\"/>\n\nHowever, several critics maintain that deinstitutionalization has, from a mental health point of view, been a thoroughgoing failure. The seriously mentally ill are either homeless, or in prison; in either case (especially the latter), they are getting little or no mental health care. This failure is attributed to a number of reasons over which there is some degree of contention, although there is general agreement that community support programs have been ineffective at best, due to a lack of funding.<ref name=Torrey_Book/>\n\nThe 2011 National Prevention Strategy included mental and emotional well-being, with recommendations including better parenting and early intervention programs, which increase the likelihood of prevention programs being included in future US mental health policies.<ref name=\":0\">{{citation |author=National Prevention Council |date=16 June 2011 |title=National Prevention Strategy |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Surgeon General |location=Washington, DC |url=http://www.healthcare.gov/prevention/nphpphc/strategy/report.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004043040/http://www.healthcare.gov/prevention/nphpphc/strategy/report.pdf |archive-date=4 October 2011 }}</ref>{{page needed |date=January 2016}} The [[National Institute of Mental Health|NIMH]] is researching only suicide and [[HIV/AIDS]] prevention, but the National Prevention Strategy could lead to it focusing more broadly on longitudinal prevention studies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Prevention of Mental Disorders|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/prevention-of-mental-disorders/index.shtml|website=National Institute of Mental Health|publisher=National Institute of Mental Health|accessdate=7 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705041918/https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/prevention-of-mental-disorders/index.shtml |archive-date=5 July 2015 }}{{Failed verification |reason=Source contains a list of publications.
