Gradually the rugby played in these breakaway competitions evolved into a distinctly separate sport that took its name from the professional leagues that administered it. [[Rugby league in England]] went on to set attendance and player payment records and [[rugby league in Australia]] became the most watched sport on television. The game also developed a significant place in the culture of [[Rugby league in France|France]], [[Rugby league in New Zealand|New Zealand]] and several other Pacific Island nations, such as [[Rugby league in Papua New Guinea|Papua New Guinea]], where it has become the national sport.\n\n== Before the schisms ==\n{{details|History of rugby union}}\n[[File:Rochdale_hornets_1875.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Rochdale Hornets]] team of 1875, one of the early rugby football clubs that then switched to rugby league]]\nAlthough many forms of football had been played across the world, it was only during the second half of the 19th century that these games began to be codified. In 1871, English clubs playing the version of football played at [[Rugby School]] which involved much more handling of the ball than in association football, met to form the [[Rugby Football Union]]. Many new rugby clubs were formed, and it was in the [[Northern England|Northern English]] [[county|counties]] of [[Lancashire]] and [[Yorkshire]] that the game really took hold. Here rugby was largely a working class game, whilst the south eastern clubs were largely middle class.\n\nRugby spread to [[Australasia]], especially the cities of Sydney, [[Brisbane]], [[Christchurch]] and [[Auckland]]. Here too there was a clear divide between the working and more affluent upper class players.\n\nThe strength of support for rugby grew over the following years, and large paying crowds were attracted to major matches, particular in Yorkshire, where matches in the [[Yorkshire Cup (rugby union)|Yorkshire Cup]] (''T'owd Tin Pot'') soon became major events. England teams of the era were dominated by Lancashire and Yorkshire players. However these players were forbidden to earn any of the spoils of this newly-rich game. Predominantly working class teams found it difficult to play to their full potential because in many cases their time to play and to train was limited by the need to earn a wage. A further limit on the playing ability of working class teams was that working class players had to be careful how hard they played. If injured, they had to pay their own medical bills and possibly take time off work, which for a man earning a weekly wage could easily lead to financial hardship.\n\n==The schism in England==\n[[File:Reverend marshall.jpg|thumb|170px|A cartoon lampooning the divide in rugby. The caricatures are of Rev. Frank Marshall, an arch-opponent of broken-time payments and James Miller, a long-time opponent of Marshall]]\nIn 1892, charges of professionalism were laid against [[rugby football]] clubs in [[Bradford]] and [[Leeds]], both in [[Yorkshire]], after they compensated players for missing work. This was despite the fact that the English [[Rugby Football Union]] (RFU) was allowing other players to be paid, such as the [[1888 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia|1888 British Isles team]] that toured Australia, and the account of [[Harry Hamill]] of his payments to represent [[New South Wales Waratahs|New South Wales]] (NSW) against {{nrut|England}} in 1904.\n\nIn 1893 Yorkshire clubs complained that southern clubs were over-represented on the RFU committee and that committee meetings were held in London at times that made it difficult for northern members to attend. By implication they were arguing that this affected the RFU's decisions on the issue of \"broken time\" payments (as compensation for the loss of income) to the detriment of northern clubs, who made up the majority of English rugby clubs. Payment for broken time was a proposal put forward by Yorkshire clubs that would allow players to receive up to six shillings (30p) (equivalent to \u00a3{{Inflation|UK|0.3|1893}} in present-day terms){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} when they missed work because of match commitments. The idea was voted down by the RFU. \n\nIn August 1893, [http://www.huddersfieldrlheritage.co.uk/Archive/Written/Players/The_Rift.html Huddersfield signed star players George Boak and John 'Jock' Forsyth] from Carlisle-based club, Cummersdale Hornets. The transfer was sudden and [http://www.bbc.co.uk/cumbria/content/articles/2007/03/06/george_boak_06032007_feature.shtml both men were summoned to appear before Carlisle magistrates' Court for leaving their jobs without giving proper notice]. Huddersfield was also accused of offering cash inducements for the players to move clubs contrary to the strict rules of the RFU. After an investigation, Huddersfield eventually received a long suspension from playing matches. \n\nThe severity of the punishments for \"broken time\" payments and their widespread application to northern clubs and players contributed to a growing sense of frustration and absence of fair play. Meanwhile, there was an obvious comparison with the professional [[the Football League|Football League]] which had been formed in 1888, comprising 12 association football clubs, six of whom were from [[Northern England]]. In this environment, the next logical step was for the northern rugby clubs to form their own professional league.\n\nOn 27 August 1895, as a result of an emergency meeting in [[Manchester]], prominent Lancashire clubs [[Broughton Rangers]], [[Leigh Centurions|Leigh]], [[Oldham R.L.F.C.|Oldham]], [[Rochdale Hornets]], [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]], [[Tyldesley FC|Tyldesley]], [[Warrington Wolves|Warrington]], [[Widnes Vikings|Widnes]] and [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] declared that they would support their Yorkshire colleagues in their proposal to form a Northern Union.\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = For several years past, the [[Yorkshire]] clubs have been endeavouring to secure a sufficient relaxation of the laws to permit the payment to players of actual out of pocket expenses (including loss of wages) incurred whilst playing for their clubs, but every proposition to that effect has been successfully combatted by the [[Southern England|Southern]] clubs, who object to the innovation as being the introduction of the thin end of [[Professional sports|professionalism]] pure and simple.

The [[Cheshire]] club, [[Stockport]], had telegraphed the meeting requesting admission to the new organisation and was duly accepted with a second Cheshire club, [[Runcorn]], admitted at the next meeting.\nThe twenty-two clubs and their years of foundation were: [[Batley Bulldogs|Batley]] 1880, [[Bradford (Park Avenue) A.F.C.|Bradford]] 1863, [[Brighouse Rangers RFC|Brighouse Rangers]] 1878, [[Broughton Rangers]] 1877, [[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]] 1873, [[Huddersfield Giants|Huddersfield FC]] 1864, [[Hull F.C.]] 1865, [[Hunslet R.L.F.C.|Hunslet]] 1883, [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] 1870, [[Leigh Centurions|Leigh]] 1878, [[Liversedge RFC|Liversedge]] 1877, [[Manningham F.C.|Manningham]] 1876, [[Oldham R.L.F.C.|Oldham]] 1876, [[Rochdale Hornets]] 1871, [[Runcorn RFC|Runcorn]] 1895, [[Stockport RFC|Stockport]] 1895, [[St Helens R.F.C.|St Helens]] 1873, [[Tyldesley FC|Tyldesley]] 1879, [[Wakefield Trinity]] 1873, [[Warrington Wolves|Warrington]] 1876, [[Widnes Vikings|Widnes]] 1875, [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] 1872.\n\nThe rugby union authorities took drastic action, issuing sanctions against clubs, players and officials involved in the new organisation. This extended even to amateurs who played with or against Northern Union sides. Consequently, northern clubs that existed purely for social and recreational rugby began to affiliate to the Northern Union, whilst retaining amateur status. By 1904 the new body had more clubs affiliated to it than the RFU.\n\nThe separate Lancashire and Yorkshire competitions of the NRFU merged in 1901, forming the Northern Rugby Football League. Also in 1901, [[James Lomas (rugby league)|James Lomas]] became the first \u00a3100 transfer, from Bramley to Salford. The NRFU became the Northern Rugby Football League in the summer of 1922.\n\nSimilar schisms in football were threatened by the formations of the [[British Football Association]] in 1884 and the [[Amateur Football Association]] in 1907, but were averted.\n\nThe historic events that led to the 1895 rugby split were the subject of Mick Martin's play ''Broken Time'', the first dramatic treatment of rugby league.<ref>{{cite web|last=[[Tony Collins (historian)|Tony Collins]]|title='Where's George?': League's Forgotten Feature Film|url=http://tony-collins.squarespace.com/rugbyreloaded/2013/6/8/wheres-george-rugby-leagues-forgotten-feature-film|work=Rugby Reloaded|accessdate=19 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Early years==\n[[File:Challenge cup 1897.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The first ever [[1897 Challenge Cup|Challenge Cup Final, 1897]]: Batley (left) vs St Helens (right)]]\nThe first international rugby league match took place in 1904 between [[England national rugby league team|England]] and an [[Other Nationalities rugby league team|Other nationalities team]], mostly made up of Welsh players.<ref name=nauright>{{cite book|last=John Nauright & Charles Parrish|title=Sports around the World|year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=USA|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mYBtMajLAaAC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9781598843019}}</ref>\n\nInitially the Northern Union continued to play under existing [[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] laws. The first minor change (awarding a penalty for a deliberate knock-on) was introduced during the [[1895\u201396 Northern Rugby Football Union season|first season]] of the game. Other new laws were gradually introduced until, by the arrival of the All Golds in 1907 the major differences between the games had been introduced. These major differences were:\n* 13 players per team as opposed to 15 in union (the two \"missing\" are the [[Flanker (rugby union)|flankers]])\n* The \"[[Playing rugby league#Play-the-ball|play the ball]]\" (heeling the ball back after a tackle) rather than a ruck\n* The elimination of the [[Line-out (rugby union)|line-out]]\n* A slightly different scoring structure, with all goals only being worth 2 points\n\n''See:'' [[Rugby league gameplay]] for more on the current game.\n\nDuring this period the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Union]] began to develop the British game's major tournaments. The [[Rugby Football League Championship|league championship]], after initially being played as one competition, was split into two sections, the [[rugby league county leagues|Lancashire and Yorkshire leagues]], with only a limited number of inter-county games. This necessitated a play-off structure to determine the overall champions. A nationwide cup, the [[Challenge Cup]] was introduced, and soon became the biggest draw in the sport. Finally, in 1905, the [[rugby league county cups|Lancashire and Yorkshire Cups]] were introduced, thus completing a structure that was to last until the 1960s. There were therefore four trophies on offer to any one club, and the \"[[Holy Grail]]\" was to win \"[[All Four Cups]]\".\n\nAs it became obvious that two codes of rugby were going to co-exist for the foreseeable future, those interested in the game needed to be able to distinguish between them. It became customary to describe those teams affiliated to the NU as 'playing in the league' hence \"rugby league\" while those which remained affiliated to the RFU (who did not play in a league) as playing \"rugby union\".\n\n==Rugby League in New Zealand==\n{{see also|Rugby league in New Zealand}}\nIn 1905, as New Zealand's rugby union team, the [[All Blacks]], toured Britain, they witnessed first-hand the growing popularity of the Northern Union games. In 1906, All Black [[George William Smith (sportsman)|George William Smith]], while on his way home, met an Australian entrepreneur, [[J J Giltinan|James J. Giltinan]] to discuss the potential of professional rugby in [[Australasia]].\n\n[[File:Albert baskerville.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Albert Henry Baskerville]].]]\nIn the meantime, a less-well known New Zealand rugby union player, [[Albert Henry Baskerville]] (or Baskiville), was about to recruit a group of players for a professional tour of Great Britain. It is believed that Baskerville first became aware of the profits to be made from such a venture while he was working at the [[Wellington]] Post Office in 1906: a colleague had a coughing fit and dropped a British newspaper. Baskerville picked it up and noticed a report about a Northern Union match that over 40,000 people had attended. Baskerville wrote to the NRFU asking if they would host a New Zealand touring party. George Smith learned of Baskerville's activities and they joined forces to recruit a team.\n\n'''All Golds tour'''\n\n{{Main|1907\u201308 New Zealand rugby tour of Australia and Great Britain}}\n\nWhen the All Golds stopped off in Australia, three games were played at the [[Sydney Showground (Moore Park)|Sydney Showground]], against a professional NSW rugby team. These games were played under rugby union laws, as no copies of the Northern Union laws were available. Baskerville was greatly impressed by [[Dally Messenger]], and persuaded him to join the touring party. For this reason, the All Golds are sometimes known as [[Australasia]], rather than New Zealand, although Messenger was the only Australian in the touring team.\n\nThe [https://web.archive.org/web/20171010124413/http://www.allgolds.net/ All Golds] arrived in Britain late in 1907 having never even seen a match played under the new Northern Union laws. They undertook a week's intensive coaching in Leeds to bring them up to speed, and after playing a number of touring matches the first true rugby league test was played, with the team going down 8\u20139 to [[Wales national rugby league team|Wales]] in [[Aberdare]] on 1 January 1908. The All Golds gained revenge however, defeating the full [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]] side in two of the three Test matches, which were played at [[Leeds]], [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] and [[Cheltenham]]; a surprising choice of venues given rugby league's northern base. The tour was a great success, and gave a much needed boost to the game in Britain, which was struggling financially against the rise of association football.\n\nBaskerville died from illness on the Australian leg of the tour, but the professional rugby movement lived on, pushing forward in New Zealand despite strong opposition from the rugby union establishment.\n\n'''Early setbacks for the game in New Zealand'''\n\nApart from the blow presented by the sudden and premature death of Baskerville, other difficulties would soon trouble the game in New Zealand. In some ways, the All Golds were too successful for the good of New Zealand rugby league, as many team members soon accepted lucrative contracts with British clubs. Baskerville's game would soon establish a strong following, especially in [[Auckland]], but rugby union's strong grassroots organisation and finances in New Zealand\u2014its \"veiled professionalism\" in the eyes of many observers at the time\u2014meant that rugby league was unable to become quite as dominant there as in some regions of Australia and England.\n\n{{Quotation|...the game is but a recreation, and no recreation should become a business.

Rumours and claims of \"shamateurism\" (see Amateur sports) in the New South Wales Rugby Union were circulating. The growing tension was exacerbated by an incident in 1907, when a working class player, [[Alex Burdon]], broke his arm while playing for the [[New South Wales]] team, and received no compensation for his time off work.\n\nGeorge Smith [[telegram|cabled]] a friend in Sydney to enquire whether there might be any support for a tour by his New Zealand professional team. Word reached Giltinan, who took great interest. Giltinan announced that he had invited Baskerville's team to play three matches in Sydney. The Australian press responded by dubbing the travelling New Zealand team \"All Golds\", a sardonic play on the nickname of the existing amateur New Zealand rugby team, the \"All Blacks\" and the supposed \"mercenary\" nature of the new code. The games were a great success; leaving the rugby rebels of Australia with much needed funds which soon proved to be vital for rugby league in Australia.\n\nA meeting was held at Bateman's Crystal Hotel in Sydney on 8 August 1907, to organise professional rugby in Australia. Giltinan, Burdon and the Test [[cricket]]er [[Victor Trumper]] were among those who attended. The meeting resolved that a \"[[New South Wales Rugby Football League]]\" (NSWRFL) should be formed, to play the Northern Union rules. This was the first time that the words \"rugby\" and \"league\" were used in the name of an Australian organising body. Players were soon recruited for the new game; despite the threat of immediate and lifetime expulsion from the New South Wales Rugby Union. The NSWRFL managed to recruit [[Dally Messenger|Herbert \"Dally\" Messenger]], the most famous rugby player in Sydney at the time.\n\nThe first season of the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership|NSWRFL competition]] was played in [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1908|1908]], and has continued to be played every year since (despite changes in administration and name), eventually going national and becoming the world's premier rugby football club competition.\n\n{{Quotation|That [the touring [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand side]]] is a professional team makes little difference to the crowd of Sydney people who want to see football.

Observers of the new game were shocked when Albert Baskerville fell ill in Brisbane and died of pneumonia. Test series between Great Britain and New Zealand are played for the [[Baskerville Shield]], named in his memory.\n\nA \"[[Queensland Rugby League|Queensland Rugby Football Association]]\" was founded, and in early July, informal club games were played in Brisbane. Later that month there were three representative games against NSW, and these acted as selection trials for a national team. The first game was also notable for a Queensland tackle which rendered one NSW player, [[Ed Fry|Ed \"Son\" Fry]], completely naked from the waist down\u2014an event which did not stop him from scoring a try.\n\nThe [[Brisbane Rugby League premiership]] began in 1909. On 8 May the first match was played in Brisbane between [[Norths Devils|Norths]] and [[Souths Logan Magpies|Souths]] before a handful of spectators at [[Brisbane Cricket Ground|the Gabba]].<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = Pramberg\n  | first = Bernie\n  | title = Leo Donovan special guest at BRL celebrations\n  | work = [[The Courier-Mail]]\n  | place =Australia\n  | publisher = Queensland Newspapers\n  | date = 2 May 2009\n  | url = http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/leo-leads-100-year-party/story-e6frep5o-1225705952744\n  | accessdate = 29 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1920s the Queensland Rugby League had established itself as a force to rival the [[New South Wales Rugby League|NSWRL]].\n\n===Rugby league's \"Ashes\"===\n\nAlso in 1908, the [[Australian national rugby union team|Australian rugby union team]] returned from a tour of the [[British Isles]], for which the team had received three [[shilling]]s a day, for [[out-of-pocket expenses]]. Thirteen of the players immediately joined rugby league teams. By the northern winter of 1908\u201309, an [[Australia national rugby league team|Australian touring party]] was heading for Great Britain, and the test series was dubbed \"[[The Ashes (rugby league)|The Ashes]]\" by the press, in imitation of [[Ashes series|The Ashes]] [[cricket]] matches, contested by Australia and England.\n\nLater in 1909, when New Zealand toured Australia, the home team's jersey featured a [[kangaroo]] for the first time, giving them the enduring nickname of \"The Kangaroos\".\n\n== 1910 to 1995 ==\n\n===Rugby league before and during the First World War===\nThe early years of the 20th century also saw attempts to establish the game in [[Wales]], with several teams being formed in the country. None of these ventures lasted long, however Wales remained a source of playing talent for rugby league. Over the years many hundreds of Welsh [[rugby union]] players \"moved north\" to the major English clubs, attracted by the opportunity to earn money playing rugby. (It was not until rugby union officially allowed professionalism, in the late 20th century that this supply of talent ceased.)\n\nThe [[1910 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand]], the first ever, took place after the [[1909\u201310 Northern Rugby Football Union season]] and featured a number of Welsh former rugby union internationals. Several Wallabies players changed codes to play against this touring team, which was anticipated to be one of the best sides ever to visit Australasia.\n\n{{Quotation|The Rugby League matches continue to command more public interest than the Union.|''[[The Sydney Mail]]'', 13 August 1910<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = \n  | first = \n  | title = Football\n  | work = The Sydney Mail\n  | place = Australia\n  | page = 54\n  | publisher = \n  | date = 13 August 1910\n  | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZEsQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=HJIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7313,3019196\n  | accessdate = 2 December 2009}}</ref>}}\n\nIn Australasia, the game centred around local, regional or statewide leagues, and there were no national competitions in either country until late in the 20th century. In both Australia and New Zealand, club championships were based on one set of home and away matches leading to a play-off, rather than the multiplicity of trophies available to British clubs. Rugby league quickly took over from rugby union as the most popular form of football in [[New South Wales]] and [[Queensland]]. The rest of the country was already dominated by [[Australian rules football]]. The amateur code still held sway in New Zealand, although the emergence of rugby league meant that it was no longer unrivalled in popularity.\n\nSport in general suffered as a result of the [[First World War]], and rugby league was no exception. In Britain, the government discouraged all professional sports, and the major competitions were abandoned. In Australia, the situation was slightly less serious, and rugby league continued. The rugby union authorities opted to suspend play throughout the war, and this decision is often cited as one of the prime reasons for the traditional dominance of rugby league over rugby union in Australia. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nAlthough the clubs continued to play, many of them were short of players due to the fighting. In 1917, Australia's first rugby league club, the [[Glebe (rugby league team)|Glebe \"Dirty Reds\"]] (founded on 9 January 1908), unleashed controversy when it fielded a player named Dan \"Laddo\" Davies. Local rivals [[Annandale (rugby league team)|Annandale]] protested that Davies lived within their designated recruiting area. Glebe were deducted two competition points and Davies received a lifetime ban. Many Glebe players already believed the NSWRL was biased against them and they went on strike; the league responded by suspending the first grade team until the following April. Davies returned to his native [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], where his previous club, Western Suburbs\u2014not to be confused with the Sydney club of the same name\u2014sought to use him in the local league. They tried repeatedly to have Davies' suspension lifted, but the NSWRL refused. When Western Suburbs fielded him in a match the NSWRL disqualified most of the local officials for a year. Disgruntled Novocastrians formed a breakaway competition, which lasted until 1919. The fortunes of Glebe, both on the field and financially, did not improve greatly after the Davies affair, and it was expelled from the main NSWRL competition in 1929.\n\nIn November 1921 in England, the first \u00a31,000 transfer fee took winger [[Harold Buck]] from [[Hunslet R.L.F.C.|Hunslet]] to [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]].\n\nInternationally, the game had settled into a steady pattern of alternating tours, with either Australia or New Zealand visiting Britain once every two years, and Britain reciprocating in the [[southern hemisphere]]. The war had intervened, but the schedule was picked up again after hostilities ceased.\n\nAn increasing number of Australian and New Zealand players headed for the bigger pay packets on offer in England, many of them destined never to be seen again on the playing fields of their home countries.\n\nIn 1933 a proposed [[hybrid sports|hybrid sport]] of rugby league and [[Australian rules football]] was trialled only once.\n\n=== 1930s and early 1940s ===\n{{see also|Rugby league in France|Rugby league in Australia#History}}\n\nFor many years, the rugby union authorities had suspected that the French rugby union was abusing the idea of amateurism, and in the early 1930s the French Rugby Union was suspended from playing against the other nations.\nIn 1932 the first rugby league match under floodlights is played between Leeds and Wigan at White City in London.<ref name=\"The History Of Rugby League\">{{cite web|title=The History of Rugby League|url=http://www.napit.co.uk/viewus/infobank/rugby/superleague/history.php|work=Rugby League Information|publisher=napit.co.uk|accessdate=2 January 2014}}</ref>\nFollowing development work by both [[Harry Sunderland]] (on behalf of the [[Australian Rugby League]]) and the [[Rugby Football League]] based in England, the Australian and Great British Test teams played an exhibition game at [[Stade Pershing]] in Paris in late December 1933.\nThe French Rugby League was formed on 6 April 1934.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lyle|first=Beaton|title=75 Years of French Rugby League|url=http://www.rleague.com/content/article.php?id=32875|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120908091158/http://www.rleague.com/content/article.php?id=32875|url-status=dead|archive-date=8 September 2012|accessdate=30 October 2011|newspaper=rleague.com|date=7 April 2009}}</ref>\n\nLooking round for an alternative, many French players turned to rugby league, which soon became the dominant game in France, particularly in the south west of the country. The arrival of a French team on the international scene allowed more variety in the touring pattern, and also for the introduction of a [[Rugby league European Nations Cup|European Championship]].\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], the British government took a more benign view of professional sports, viewing them as a vital aid to public morale. Although normal leagues were suspended, a War Emergency League was established, with clubs playing separate Yorkshire and Lancashire sections to reduce the need for travel. This period also saw a temporary relaxation of the regulations prohibiting rugby union players from contact with rugby league. In an extraordinary development a team representing rugby league met a rugby union equivalent in two matches, held to raise money for the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]]. Both games were held under rugby union rules; both were won by the rugby league side.\n\nIn Australia, the war years produced large crowds, and financially at least, the sport did not suffer the hardships endured during the First World War. Nonetheless, the loss of many young men in fighting undoubtedly weakened the talent pool available.\n\nThe defeat of France had serious implications for [[rugby league in France]]. The [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime banned rugby league and forced players, clubs and officials to switch codes to union. Assets of the rugby league and its clubs were handed over to union.\n\nThe consequences of this action still reverberate; the assets were never returned, and although the ban on rugby league was lifted, it was prevented from calling itself rugby from 1949 to the mid-1980s, having to use the name '''Jeu \u00e0 Treize''' (''Game of Thirteen'', in reference to the number of players in a rugby league side).\n\n=== Late 1940s and 1950s ===\n\nThe rules of the sport had continued to evolve, and until the 1940s there was no world governing body to oversee this and ensure consistency. Negotiations between the respective governing bodies were required to fix rules to be used for tours, though generally the other nations took their lead from the British authorities. For example, the [[field goal (rugby)|field goal]] was banned by the New South Wales Rugby League in 1922 however this method of scoring was not officially recognised as being removed from the game until 1950 when the British authorities banned it.<ref>http://www.wakefieldtrinity-programmes.co.uk/page_2655812.html</ref>\n\nThis situation endured until 1948, when at the instigation of the French, the [[International Rugby League|Rugby League International Federation]] (RLIF) was formed at a meeting on 25 January 1948 in [[Bordeaux]]. The [[1947\u201348 Northern Rugby Football League season]]'s [[Challenge Cup]] Final was the first rugby league match to be televised.<ref name=\"The History Of Rugby League\"/> All spectator sports in the United Kingdom experienced a surge in interest in the years following the end of [[World War II]] and rugby league boomed.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = Demsteader\n  | first = Christine\n  | title = Rugby League's home from home\n  | work = BBC Sport\n  | place =UK\n  | pages = \n  | publisher = BBC\n  | date = 1 October 2000\n  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/in_depth/2000/wembley/944481.stm\n  | accessdate = 4 December 2009}}</ref> Large crowds came to be expected as the norm for a period of around 20 years. The total crowds for the British season hit a record in [[1949\u201350 Northern Rugby Football League season|1949\u201350]], when over 69.8&nbsp;million paying customers attended all matches.<ref>{{cite book|last=[[Jon Henderson]]|title=Best of British: Hendo's sporting heroes|year=2007|publisher=Yellow Jersey Press|location=UK|isbn=9780224082488|page=85|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7JPPsF02plgC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> On Saturday 10 November 1951 the first televised international rugby league match was broadcast from Station Road, Swinton, where Great Britain met New Zealand in the second Test of that 1951 series.\n\nThe surge in public interest in the sport was further demonstrated by the 1954 [[Challenge Cup]] Final Replay between [[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]] and [[Warrington Wolves|Warrington]], held at Odsal Stadium, [[Bradford]] on Wednesday, 5 May 1954. The officially recorded attendance was at 102,569(a record for a single match of rugby league that stood until 107,999 watched [[Melbourne Storm]] defeat [[St George Illawarra Dragons]] at [[Stadium Australia]] in [[National Rugby League season 1999|1999]]). It is estimated that a further 20,000 spectators were present, as many got in free after a section of fencing collapsed. Warrington beat Halifax 8\u20134.\n\nThis period also saw growth in crowds in Australia, New Zealand and France. This was a golden age for the French, who led by the incomparable [[Puig Aubert]], travelled to Australia and defeated their host in a three test series in 1951. On their return to France the victorious team were greeted by an estimated 100,000 fans in [[Marseille]]. They repeated the feat in France 1952\u201353 and again in Australia in 1955.\n\nThe French were the driving force behind the staging of the first [[1954 Rugby League World Cup|Rugby League World Cup]] (also the first tournament to be officially known as the \"Rugby World Cup\") in 1954. This competition has been held intermittently since then, in a variety of formats. Unlike many other sports the World Cup has never really been the pinnacle of the international game, that honour falling to international test series such as the [[The Ashes (rugby league)|Ashes]].\n\nIn 1956, the [[state government]] of [[New South Wales]] legalised the playing of [[poker machine]]s (\"pokies\") in profit clubs, and this rapidly became the major source of income for NSW \"[[leagues clubs]]\", some of which became palatial \"homes away from home\" for their supporters. The pokie windfall stemmed the steady trickle of Australian players to the better-financed clubs in England, and led to increased recruiting of rugby union and league players from [[Queensland]] and overseas by New South Welsh clubs. Within the space of several years, the Sydney-based league had come to dominate the code within Australia. The large profits accrued from gambling have always been controversial; many questioned the morality of such an income stream and felt that it would inevitably lead to financial turmoil and scandal.\n\n=== 1960s and 1970s ===\n1961 saw the first televised game of rugby league in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|last=[[Sean Fagan]]|title=nrl.com|url=http://www.nrl.com/nrlhq/referencecentre/historyofrugbyleague/tabid/10440/default.aspx|work=History of Rugby League|publisher=[[NRL]]|accessdate=2 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623221835/http://www.nrl.com/nrlhq/referencecentre/historyofrugbyleague/tabid/10440/default.aspx|archive-date=23 June 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the UK live coverage of professional rugby league began in the early 1960s, exposing the game to a national audience.<ref>{{cite book|last=Eric Dunning, Kenneth Sheard|title=Barbarians, Gentlemen And Players: A Sociological Study Of The Development Of Rugby Football|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=UK|isbn= 9780714682907|page=194|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1V7IT4O1tmgC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> [[David Attenborough]], then controller of [[BBC2]], made the decision to screen rugby league games from a new competition specially designed for evening televising, the ''BBC2 Television Floodlit Trophy''. Although it was widely seen as a [[gimmick]], it proved a success, and rugby league has featured on television ever since, to the point where (like most sports) income from selling broadcasting rights is the single greatest source of revenue for the game. In Australia the [[1967 NSWRFL season]]'s [[grand final]] became the first football grand final of any code to be televised live in Australia. The [[Nine Network]] had paid $5,000 for the broadcasting rights.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last = Masters\n  | first = Roy\n  | authorlink = Roy Masters (sport) \n  | title = Messenger can watch a better league broadcast in the US than south of the border\n  | work = [[Brisbane Times]]\n  | publisher = Fairfax Digital  \n  | date = 4 October 2009\n  | url = http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/business/messenger-can-watch-a-better-league-broadcast-in-the-us-than-south-of-the-border-20091004-ghve.html\n  | doi = \n  | accessdate = 4 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nThis period also saw further alterations to the rules of the sport. In 1964 substitutes were allowed for the first time, but only for players injured before half-time. In 1966 limited tackles were introduced. In 1967 professional matches were first allowed on Sundays. Also this year the number of times a team could retain possession after a [[Rugby league#play-the-ball|play-the-ball]] was limited to four tackles.<ref name=WIP>{{cite book\n |last=Middleton \n |first=David \n |title=League of Legends: 100 Years of Rugby League in Australia \n |publisher=National Museum of Australia \n |year=2008 \n |page=27 \n |url=http://www.nma.gov.au/shared/libraries/attachments/league_of_legends/rugby_league_a_work_in_progress/files/22453/F_RL_work_in_progress.pdf \n |isbn=978-1-876944-64-3 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317093000/http://www.nma.gov.au/shared/libraries/attachments/league_of_legends/rugby_league_a_work_in_progress/files/22453/F_RL_work_in_progress.pdf \n |archivedate=17 March 2011 \n |df=dmy-all \n}}</ref> The concept of limited tackles had existed in [[American football]] since the 1880s, and it was hoped that this would encourage more attacking play, and prevent teams from simply playing to maintain possession of the ball at all costs. Although successful in this respect, it was felt that four tackles did not give sufficient time to develop an attack, with play often being characterised by pure panic. In 1971, the number of tackles allowed was increased to six, and has remained so ever since. That year the value of field goals was reduced as well, from 2 to 1.<ref name= WIP/>\n\nIn Britain's 1971\u201372 season, sponsors first entered the game: brewers [[Joshua Tetley]] and cigarette brand [[John Player]]. In 1976 Sydney club Eastern Suburbs set a precedent with a major sponsor, City Ford appearing on their jersey.\n\nIn 1977 Australian forward [[Graham Olling]] made headlines when he became the first rugby league player to admit to taking [[anabolic steroids]], which at the time were not illegal in the sport.<ref>{{cite news|last=Curtin|first=Jennie|title=Simply the Best|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&docID=news980713_0529_7766|accessdate=2 January 2012|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=11 July 1998}}</ref>\n\n===1980s and early 1990s===\n\nIn 1980 the [[1980 State of Origin game|first State of Origin match]] was played in Australia. This pitted teams representative of [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]] against each other. Although matches between the two had taken place for many years, the ''origin'' concept (borrowed from [[Australian rules football]]) meant that for the first time players were selected based on where they first played the game, rather than where they were currently playing. This had an immediate effect, evening up the competition, which had come to be dominated by New South Wales because of the financial strength of the Sydney clubs, and rousing greater pride in spectators as their players were considered more truly representative of their respective states. State of Origin matches are now some of the biggest and most keenly fought contests in Australian sport.\n\nThe 1980s also saw attempts to improve rugby league's popularity outside its traditional geographical boundaries. In Great Britain a new team from London ([[London Broncos#2006\u20132011: Harlequins Rugby League|Fulham]]) was admitted to the professional ranks. In Australia, the first sides from outside the Sydney metropolitan area entered the top-flight competition in. In [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1982|1982]] the [[Illawarra Steelers]] (based in [[Wollongong]]) and the [[Canberra Raiders]] (based in the national capital, [[Canberra]]) entered the competition. As a result of a lucrative illegal [[betting]] market having developed since the [[Second World War]], [[FootyTAB]] was founded in 1983 to develop legal betting on rugby league, and was a resounding success.\n\nIn 1981 the '[[Sin Bin]]' rule was introduced in rugby league in Australia. [[Newtown Jets|Newtown]] hooker Barry Jensen became the first player sent there.\nIn 1983 the number of points awarded for scoring a try increased from three to four. Also in 1983, the Australian [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC-TV]] [[current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] programme ''[[Four Corners (Australian TV program)|Four Corners]]'', aired an episode entitled \"The Big League\". The programme was to have repercussions throughout Australian sport, and in the wider community. Reporter [[Chris Masters (writer)|Chris Masters]] (the brother of league identity [[Roy Masters (sport)|Roy Masters]]) described allegations of corruption within the NSWRL, including suggestions that officials were siphoning funds from particular clubs and international matches while players and spectators endured sub-standard facilities. As a result of the programme, a [[Royal Commission]] (the ''Street Royal Commission'') was called. It led to the New South Wales chief magistrate [[Murray Farquhar]] being jailed, the end of NSWRL president [[Kevin Humphreys (rugby league)|Kevin Humphreys]]' career and the ABC being sued for libel by NSW State [[Premiers of the Australian states|Premier]], [[Neville Wran]] (who eventually settled out of court). Masters, ''Four Corners'' and the commission are widely credited with widespread improvements in the administration of rugby league in Australia.\n\nIn the late 1980s, rugby league competitions were launched or continued to expand in Russia, [[Papua New Guinea]] and the Pacific islands.\n\nA further expansion to the NSWRL in [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1988|1988]] saw the first Queensland teams added to the league: [[Brisbane Broncos]] and [[Gold Coast Chargers|Gold Coast Giants]], as well as another team from outside Sydney, [[Newcastle Knights]]. Expansion occurred again in 1995, with the addition to the League of teams from Perth, Townsville and Auckland.\n{{quote|\"Thirteen-man rugby league has shown itself to be a faster, more open game of better athletes than the other code.

This event affected the sport across the world during the middle of decade, and the damage done is only now being undone.\n\n== Super League ==\n[[File:Suncorp Stadium.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Modern rugby league: [[Brisbane Broncos]] take on [[Canterbury Bulldogs]] in the [[NRL]].]]\nWhile the [[Super League war]] was being fought in Australia, [[Rupert Murdoch]] approached the English clubs with a view to forming a [[Super League]], primarily as a way to gain the upper hand during his battle with [[Kerry Packer]] for broadcasting rights for the sport in Australia. A large sum of money from [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]]'s UK subsidiary, [[BSkyB]], helped fund the proposal. The new competition got under way in 1996. As part of the deal, rugby league switched from a winter to a summer season. The British, Australian and New Zealand seasons are now played concurrently from March to October, and major international tournaments are now largely played in November. The French, however, have continued to play a winter season.\n\nAfter the 1997 season in Australia the [[Super League war]] came to an end, with [[News International]] and the [[Australian Rugby League]] agreeing to merge their competitions to create the [[National Rugby League]], which commenced in 1998. The first ever team from [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], the [[Melbourne Storm]] entered the competition. Several clubs were either forced to merge (e.g. [[St. George Dragons]] and [[Illawarra Steelers]] became [[St George Illawarra Dragons]]), or folded. The omission of [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]], one of the founding members of the original NSWRL, led to mass protests. Although Souths did not participate in the NRL during 2000 and 2001, a Federal Court decision in July 2001 paved the way for them to return to the league in 2002.\n\nIn 1995, [[rugby union]] went professional, and those who had long derided rugby league as merely a professional version of that game were soon predicting the demise of the sport. The Super League war, the financial problems of the [[2000 Rugby League World Cup]] and the signing of several high-profile rugby league stars by the union game gave ammunition to this claim.\n\n==New millennium==\nWith the professionalism of rugby union, several high-profile league players changed codes, with varying degrees of success. Australian RU administrators appeared to be targeting league internationals when in 2001/02 [[Australia national rugby league team|Kangaroos]] [[Wendell Sailor]], [[Mat Rogers]] and [[Lote Tuqiri]] all switched and soon represented the [[Australia national rugby union team|Wallabies]]. Other high-profile players, such as [[Jason Robinson (rugby player)|Jason Robinson]], [[Iestyn Harris]] and [[Henry Paul]] followed. However press claims at the time that the \"flood-gates\" had opened proved to be more sensational than portentous. By the end of the decade, the flow of league players moving on big-money contracts to union seemed to have stabilised, and in fact in many cases this actually proved to be positive for rugby league, with the money gained from transfer fees being used to fund expansion and additional youth development in Britain and with many of the star crossover players returning to rugby league in Australia.\n\n{{Quotation|The game needs to be aware of it and take steps to ensure that it doesn't become a flood.

The 2008 competition was heralded as a great success, turning a significant profit, and was generally seen as a major step forwards in the development of the international game. In addition, the [[Rugby league European Federation]] was set up during the decade and as a result the game saw massive advances in both the quality and quantity of international competition. The game in France saw a renaissance, largely as a result of the [[Catalans Dragons]] entry into Super League, while large advances were made in other countries such as Wales and New Zealand, who finished the decade as World Champions.\n\nIn Australia in 2009, rugby league's popularity was confirmed as it had the highest official television ratings figures of any sporting event.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = Newstalk ZB\n  | first = \n  | title = League becomes Australia's top sport\n  | work = [[TVNZ]]\n  | place =New Zealand\n  | pages = \n  | publisher = Television New Zealand Limited\n  | date = 21 December 2009\n  | url = http://tvnz.co.nz/rugby-league-news/league-becomes-australia-s-top-sport-3315931\n  | accessdate = 24 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n==2010s==\n\nThe [[2013 Rugby League World Cup]] was held in Europe, with the final played at England's [[Old Trafford]] in front of 74,468, the largest crowd to attend an international fixture.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fletcher|first=Paul|title=Rugby League World Cup 2013: A joy that must not be wasted|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-league/25022239|accessdate=1 December 2013|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=1 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe 2014 [[National Rugby League]] Grand Final was the highest rated television show for the year in Australia.<ref>http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/tv-ratings/my-kitchen-rules-the-block-afl-grand-final-and-nrl-grand-final-dominate-the-top-tv-events-of-2014/news-story/34f43c437fc80787d62a13deabf27f4b</ref>\n\nIn 2015, the league went through a [[2015 Rugby League Structure|structure change]] with promotion and relegation reintroduced between [[Super League]] and the [[Championship]].

Gradually the rugby played in these breakaway competitions evolved into a distinctly separate sport that took its name from the professional leagues that administered it. [[Rugby league in England]] went on to set attendance and player payment records and [[rugby league in Australia]] became the most watched sport on television. The game also developed a significant place in the culture of [[Rugby league in France|France]], [[Rugby league in New Zealand|New Zealand]] and several other Pacific Island nations, such as [[Rugby league in Papua New Guinea|Papua New Guinea]], where it has become the national sport.\n\n== Before the schisms ==\n{{details|History of rugby union}}\n[[File:Rochdale_hornets_1875.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Rochdale Hornets]] team of 1875, one of the early rugby football clubs that then switched to rugby league]]\nAlthough many forms of football had been played across the world, it was only during the second half of the 19th century that these games began to be codified. In 1871, English clubs playing the version of football played at [[Rugby School]] which involved much more handling of the ball than in association football, met to form the [[Rugby Football Union]]. Many new rugby clubs were formed, and it was in the [[Northern England|Northern English]] [[county|counties]] of [[Lancashire]] and [[Yorkshire]] that the game really took hold. Here rugby was largely a working class game, whilst the south eastern clubs were largely middle class.\n\nRugby spread to [[Australasia]], especially the cities of Sydney, [[Brisbane]], [[Christchurch]] and [[Auckland]]. Here too there was a clear divide between the working and more affluent upper class players.\n\nThe strength of support for rugby grew over the following years, and large paying crowds were attracted to major matches, particular in Yorkshire, where matches in the [[Yorkshire Cup (rugby union)|Yorkshire Cup]] (''T'owd Tin Pot'') soon became major events. England teams of the era were dominated by Lancashire and Yorkshire players. However these players were forbidden to earn any of the spoils of this newly-rich game. Predominantly working class teams found it difficult to play to their full potential because in many cases their time to play and to train was limited by the need to earn a wage. A further limit on the playing ability of working class teams was that working class players had to be careful how hard they played. If injured, they had to pay their own medical bills and possibly take time off work, which for a man earning a weekly wage could easily lead to financial hardship.\n\n==The schism in England==\n[[File:Reverend marshall.jpg|thumb|170px|A cartoon lampooning the divide in rugby. The caricatures are of Rev. Frank Marshall, an arch-opponent of broken-time payments and James Miller, a long-time opponent of Marshall]]\nIn 1892, charges of professionalism were laid against [[rugby football]] clubs in [[Bradford]] and [[Leeds]], both in [[Yorkshire]], after they compensated players for missing work. This was despite the fact that the English [[Rugby Football Union]] (RFU) was allowing other players to be paid, such as the [[1888 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia|1888 British Isles team]] that toured Australia, and the account of [[Harry Hamill]] of his payments to represent [[New South Wales Waratahs|New South Wales]] (NSW) against {{nrut|England}} in 1904.\n\nIn 1893 Yorkshire clubs complained that southern clubs were over-represented on the RFU committee and that committee meetings were held in London at times that made it difficult for northern members to attend. By implication they were arguing that this affected the RFU's decisions on the issue of \"broken time\" payments (as compensation for the loss of income) to the detriment of northern clubs, who made up the majority of English rugby clubs. Payment for broken time was a proposal put forward by Yorkshire clubs that would allow players to receive up to six shillings (30p) (equivalent to \u00a3{{Inflation|UK|0.3|1893}} in present-day terms){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} when they missed work because of match commitments. The idea was voted down by the RFU. \n\nIn August 1893, [http://www.huddersfieldrlheritage.co.uk/Archive/Written/Players/The_Rift.html Huddersfield signed star players George Boak and John 'Jock' Forsyth] from Carlisle-based club, Cummersdale Hornets. The transfer was sudden and [http://www.bbc.co.uk/cumbria/content/articles/2007/03/06/george_boak_06032007_feature.shtml both men were summoned to appear before Carlisle magistrates' Court for leaving their jobs without giving proper notice]. Huddersfield was also accused of offering cash inducements for the players to move clubs contrary to the strict rules of the RFU. After an investigation, Huddersfield eventually received a long suspension from playing matches. \n\nThe severity of the punishments for \"broken time\" payments and their widespread application to northern clubs and players contributed to a growing sense of frustration and absence of fair play. Meanwhile, there was an obvious comparison with the professional [[the Football League|Football League]] which had been formed in 1888, comprising 12 association football clubs, six of whom were from [[Northern England]]. In this environment, the next logical step was for the northern rugby clubs to form their own professional league.\n\nOn 27 August 1895, as a result of an emergency meeting in [[Manchester]], prominent Lancashire clubs [[Broughton Rangers]], [[Leigh Centurions|Leigh]], [[Oldham R.L.F.C.|Oldham]], [[Rochdale Hornets]], [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]], [[Tyldesley FC|Tyldesley]], [[Warrington Wolves|Warrington]], [[Widnes Vikings|Widnes]] and [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] declared that they would support their Yorkshire colleagues in their proposal to form a Northern Union.\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = For several years past, the [[Yorkshire]] clubs have been endeavouring to secure a sufficient relaxation of the laws to permit the payment to players of actual out of pocket expenses (including loss of wages) incurred whilst playing for their clubs, but every proposition to that effect has been successfully combatted by the [[Southern England|Southern]] clubs, who object to the innovation as being the introduction of the thin end of [[Professional sports|professionalism]] pure and simple.

The [[Cheshire]] club, [[Stockport]], had telegraphed the meeting requesting admission to the new organisation and was duly accepted with a second Cheshire club, [[Runcorn]], admitted at the next meeting.\nThe twenty-two clubs and their years of foundation were: [[Batley Bulldogs|Batley]] 1880, [[Bradford (Park Avenue) A.F.C.|Bradford]] 1863, [[Brighouse Rangers RFC|Brighouse Rangers]] 1878, [[Broughton Rangers]] 1877, [[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]] 1873, [[Huddersfield Giants|Huddersfield FC]] 1864, [[Hull F.C.]] 1865, [[Hunslet R.L.F.C.|Hunslet]] 1883, [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] 1870, [[Leigh Centurions|Leigh]] 1878, [[Liversedge RFC|Liversedge]] 1877, [[Manningham F.C.|Manningham]] 1876, [[Oldham R.L.F.C.|Oldham]] 1876, [[Rochdale Hornets]] 1871, [[Runcorn RFC|Runcorn]] 1895, [[Stockport RFC|Stockport]] 1895, [[St Helens R.F.C.|St Helens]] 1873, [[Tyldesley FC|Tyldesley]] 1879, [[Wakefield Trinity]] 1873, [[Warrington Wolves|Warrington]] 1876, [[Widnes Vikings|Widnes]] 1875, [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] 1872.\n\nThe rugby union authorities took drastic action, issuing sanctions against clubs, players and officials involved in the new organisation. This extended even to amateurs who played with or against Northern Union sides. Consequently, northern clubs that existed purely for social and recreational rugby began to affiliate to the Northern Union, whilst retaining amateur status. By 1904 the new body had more clubs affiliated to it than the RFU.\n\nThe separate Lancashire and Yorkshire competitions of the NRFU merged in 1901, forming the Northern Rugby Football League. Also in 1901, [[James Lomas (rugby league)|James Lomas]] became the first \u00a3100 transfer, from Bramley to Salford. The NRFU became the Northern Rugby Football League in the summer of 1922.\n\nSimilar schisms in football were threatened by the formations of the [[British Football Association]] in 1884 and the [[Amateur Football Association]] in 1907, but were averted.\n\nThe historic events that led to the 1895 rugby split were the subject of Mick Martin's play ''Broken Time'', the first dramatic treatment of rugby league.<ref>{{cite web|last=[[Tony Collins (historian)|Tony Collins]]|title='Where's George?': League's Forgotten Feature Film|url=http://tony-collins.squarespace.com/rugbyreloaded/2013/6/8/wheres-george-rugby-leagues-forgotten-feature-film|work=Rugby Reloaded|accessdate=19 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Early years==\n[[File:Challenge cup 1897.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The first ever [[1897 Challenge Cup|Challenge Cup Final, 1897]]: Batley (left) vs St Helens (right)]]\nThe first international rugby league match took place in 1904 between [[England national rugby league team|England]] and an [[Other Nationalities rugby league team|Other nationalities team]], mostly made up of Welsh players.<ref name=nauright>{{cite book|last=John Nauright & Charles Parrish|title=Sports around the World|year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=USA|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mYBtMajLAaAC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9781598843019}}</ref>\n\nInitially the Northern Union continued to play under existing [[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] laws. The first minor change (awarding a penalty for a deliberate knock-on) was introduced during the [[1895\u201396 Northern Rugby Football Union season|first season]] of the game. Other new laws were gradually introduced until, by the arrival of the All Golds in 1907 the major differences between the games had been introduced. These major differences were:\n* 13 players per team as opposed to 15 in union (the two \"missing\" are the [[Flanker (rugby union)|flankers]])\n* The \"[[Playing rugby league#Play-the-ball|play the ball]]\" (heeling the ball back after a tackle) rather than a ruck\n* The elimination of the [[Line-out (rugby union)|line-out]]\n* A slightly different scoring structure, with all goals only being worth 2 points\n\n''See:'' [[Rugby league gameplay]] for more on the current game.\n\nDuring this period the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Union]] began to develop the British game's major tournaments. The [[Rugby Football League Championship|league championship]], after initially being played as one competition, was split into two sections, the [[rugby league county leagues|Lancashire and Yorkshire leagues]], with only a limited number of inter-county games. This necessitated a play-off structure to determine the overall champions. A nationwide cup, the [[Challenge Cup]] was introduced, and soon became the biggest draw in the sport. Finally, in 1905, the [[rugby league county cups|Lancashire and Yorkshire Cups]] were introduced, thus completing a structure that was to last until the 1960s. There were therefore four trophies on offer to any one club, and the \"[[Holy Grail]]\" was to win \"[[All Four Cups]]\".\n\nAs it became obvious that two codes of rugby were going to co-exist for the foreseeable future, those interested in the game needed to be able to distinguish between them. It became customary to describe those teams affiliated to the NU as 'playing in the league' hence \"rugby league\" while those which remained affiliated to the RFU (who did not play in a league) as playing \"rugby union\".\n\n==Rugby League in New Zealand==\n{{see also|Rugby league in New Zealand}}\nIn 1905, as New Zealand's rugby union team, the [[All Blacks]], toured Britain, they witnessed first-hand the growing popularity of the Northern Union games. In 1906, All Black [[George William Smith (sportsman)|George William Smith]], while on his way home, met an Australian entrepreneur, [[J J Giltinan|James J. Giltinan]] to discuss the potential of professional rugby in [[Australasia]].\n\n[[File:Albert baskerville.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Albert Henry Baskerville]].]]\nIn the meantime, a less-well known New Zealand rugby union player, [[Albert Henry Baskerville]] (or Baskiville), was about to recruit a group of players for a professional tour of Great Britain. It is believed that Baskerville first became aware of the profits to be made from such a venture while he was working at the [[Wellington]] Post Office in 1906: a colleague had a coughing fit and dropped a British newspaper. Baskerville picked it up and noticed a report about a Northern Union match that over 40,000 people had attended. Baskerville wrote to the NRFU asking if they would host a New Zealand touring party. George Smith learned of Baskerville's activities and they joined forces to recruit a team.\n\n'''All Golds tour'''\n\n{{Main|1907\u201308 New Zealand rugby tour of Australia and Great Britain}}\n\nWhen the All Golds stopped off in Australia, three games were played at the [[Sydney Showground (Moore Park)|Sydney Showground]], against a professional NSW rugby team. These games were played under rugby union laws, as no copies of the Northern Union laws were available. Baskerville was greatly impressed by [[Dally Messenger]], and persuaded him to join the touring party. For this reason, the All Golds are sometimes known as [[Australasia]], rather than New Zealand, although Messenger was the only Australian in the touring team.\n\nThe [https://web.archive.org/web/20171010124413/http://www.allgolds.net/ All Golds] arrived in Britain late in 1907 having never even seen a match played under the new Northern Union laws. They undertook a week's intensive coaching in Leeds to bring them up to speed, and after playing a number of touring matches the first true rugby league test was played, with the team going down 8\u20139 to [[Wales national rugby league team|Wales]] in [[Aberdare]] on 1 January 1908. The All Golds gained revenge however, defeating the full [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]] side in two of the three Test matches, which were played at [[Leeds]], [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] and [[Cheltenham]]; a surprising choice of venues given rugby league's northern base. The tour was a great success, and gave a much needed boost to the game in Britain, which was struggling financially against the rise of association football.\n\nBaskerville died from illness on the Australian leg of the tour, but the professional rugby movement lived on, pushing forward in New Zealand despite strong opposition from the rugby union establishment.\n\n'''Early setbacks for the game in New Zealand'''\n\nApart from the blow presented by the sudden and premature death of Baskerville, other difficulties would soon trouble the game in New Zealand. In some ways, the All Golds were too successful for the good of New Zealand rugby league, as many team members soon accepted lucrative contracts with British clubs. Baskerville's game would soon establish a strong following, especially in [[Auckland]], but rugby union's strong grassroots organisation and finances in New Zealand\u2014its \"veiled professionalism\" in the eyes of many observers at the time\u2014meant that rugby league was unable to become quite as dominant there as in some regions of Australia and England.\n\n{{Quotation|...the game is but a recreation, and no recreation should become a business.

Rumours and claims of \"shamateurism\" (see Amateur sports) in the New South Wales Rugby Union were circulating. The growing tension was exacerbated by an incident in 1907, when a working class player, [[Alex Burdon]], broke his arm while playing for the [[New South Wales]] team, and received no compensation for his time off work.\n\nGeorge Smith [[telegram|cabled]] a friend in Sydney to enquire whether there might be any support for a tour by his New Zealand professional team. Word reached Giltinan, who took great interest. Giltinan announced that he had invited Baskerville's team to play three matches in Sydney. The Australian press responded by dubbing the travelling New Zealand team \"All Golds\", a sardonic play on the nickname of the existing amateur New Zealand rugby team, the \"All Blacks\" and the supposed \"mercenary\" nature of the new code. The games were a great success; leaving the rugby rebels of Australia with much needed funds which soon proved to be vital for rugby league in Australia.\n\nA meeting was held at Bateman's Crystal Hotel in Sydney on 8 August 1907, to organise professional rugby in Australia. Giltinan, Burdon and the Test [[cricket]]er [[Victor Trumper]] were among those who attended. The meeting resolved that a \"[[New South Wales Rugby Football League]]\" (NSWRFL) should be formed, to play the Northern Union rules. This was the first time that the words \"rugby\" and \"league\" were used in the name of an Australian organising body. Players were soon recruited for the new game; despite the threat of immediate and lifetime expulsion from the New South Wales Rugby Union. The NSWRFL managed to recruit [[Dally Messenger|Herbert \"Dally\" Messenger]], the most famous rugby player in Sydney at the time.\n\nThe first season of the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership|NSWRFL competition]] was played in [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1908|1908]], and has continued to be played every year since (despite changes in administration and name), eventually going national and becoming the world's premier rugby football club competition.\n\n{{Quotation|That [the touring [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand side]]] is a professional team makes little difference to the crowd of Sydney people who want to see football.

On 16 May 1908, the returning New Zealanders played a hastily assembled Queensland team in [[Brisbane]]. Observers of the new game were shocked when Albert Baskerville fell ill in Brisbane and died of pneumonia. Test series between Great Britain and New Zealand are played for the [[Baskerville Shield]], named in his memory.\n\nA \"[[Queensland Rugby League|Queensland Rugby Football Association]]\" was founded, and in early July, informal club games were played in Brisbane. Later that month there were three representative games against NSW, and these acted as selection trials for a national team. The first game was also notable for a Queensland tackle which rendered one NSW player, [[Ed Fry|Ed \"Son\" Fry]], completely naked from the waist down\u2014an event which did not stop him from scoring a try.\n\nThe [[Brisbane Rugby League premiership]] began in 1909. On 8 May the first match was played in Brisbane between [[Norths Devils|Norths]] and [[Souths Logan Magpies|Souths]] before a handful of spectators at [[Brisbane Cricket Ground|the Gabba]].<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = Pramberg\n  | first = Bernie\n  | title = Leo Donovan special guest at BRL celebrations\n  | work = [[The Courier-Mail]]\n  | place =Australia\n  | publisher = Queensland Newspapers\n  | date = 2 May 2009\n  | url = http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/leo-leads-100-year-party/story-e6frep5o-1225705952744\n  | accessdate = 29 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1920s the Queensland Rugby League had established itself as a force to rival the [[New South Wales Rugby League|NSWRL]].\n\n===Rugby league's \"Ashes\"===\n\nAlso in 1908, the [[Australian national rugby union team|Australian rugby union team]] returned from a tour of the [[British Isles]], for which the team had received three [[shilling]]s a day, for [[out-of-pocket expenses]]. Thirteen of the players immediately joined rugby league teams. By the northern winter of 1908\u201309, an [[Australia national rugby league team|Australian touring party]] was heading for Great Britain, and the test series was dubbed \"[[The Ashes (rugby league)|The Ashes]]\" by the press, in imitation of [[Ashes series|The Ashes]] [[cricket]] matches, contested by Australia and England.\n\nLater in 1909, when New Zealand toured Australia, the home team's jersey featured a [[kangaroo]] for the first time, giving them the enduring nickname of \"The Kangaroos\".\n\n== 1910 to 1995 ==\n\n===Rugby league before and during the First World War===\nThe early years of the 20th century also saw attempts to establish the game in [[Wales]], with several teams being formed in the country. None of these ventures lasted long, however Wales remained a source of playing talent for rugby league. Over the years many hundreds of Welsh [[rugby union]] players \"moved north\" to the major English clubs, attracted by the opportunity to earn money playing rugby. (It was not until rugby union officially allowed professionalism, in the late 20th century that this supply of talent ceased.)\n\nThe [[1910 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand]], the first ever, took place after the [[1909\u201310 Northern Rugby Football Union season]] and featured a number of Welsh former rugby union internationals. Several Wallabies players changed codes to play against this touring team, which was anticipated to be one of the best sides ever to visit Australasia.\n\n{{Quotation|The Rugby League matches continue to command more public interest than the Union.|''[[The Sydney Mail]]'', 13 August 1910<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = \n  | first = \n  | title = Football\n  | work = The Sydney Mail\n  | place = Australia\n  | page = 54\n  | publisher = \n  | date = 13 August 1910\n  | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZEsQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=HJIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7313,3019196\n  | accessdate = 2 December 2009}}</ref>}}\n\nIn Australasia, the game centred around local, regional or statewide leagues, and there were no national competitions in either country until late in the 20th century. In both Australia and New Zealand, club championships were based on one set of home and away matches leading to a play-off, rather than the multiplicity of trophies available to British clubs. Rugby league quickly took over from rugby union as the most popular form of football in [[New South Wales]] and [[Queensland]]. The rest of the country was already dominated by [[Australian rules football]]. The amateur code still held sway in New Zealand, although the emergence of rugby league meant that it was no longer unrivalled in popularity.\n\nSport in general suffered as a result of the [[First World War]], and rugby league was no exception. In Britain, the government discouraged all professional sports, and the major competitions were abandoned. In Australia, the situation was slightly less serious, and rugby league continued. The rugby union authorities opted to suspend play throughout the war, and this decision is often cited as one of the prime reasons for the traditional dominance of rugby league over rugby union in Australia. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nAlthough the clubs continued to play, many of them were short of players due to the fighting. In 1917, Australia's first rugby league club, the [[Glebe (rugby league team)|Glebe \"Dirty Reds\"]] (founded on 9 January 1908), unleashed controversy when it fielded a player named Dan \"Laddo\" Davies. Local rivals [[Annandale (rugby league team)|Annandale]] protested that Davies lived within their designated recruiting area. Glebe were deducted two competition points and Davies received a lifetime ban. Many Glebe players already believed the NSWRL was biased against them and they went on strike; the league responded by suspending the first grade team until the following April. Davies returned to his native [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], where his previous club, Western Suburbs\u2014not to be confused with the Sydney club of the same name\u2014sought to use him in the local league. They tried repeatedly to have Davies' suspension lifted, but the NSWRL refused. When Western Suburbs fielded him in a match the NSWRL disqualified most of the local officials for a year. Disgruntled Novocastrians formed a breakaway competition, which lasted until 1919. The fortunes of Glebe, both on the field and financially, did not improve greatly after the Davies affair, and it was expelled from the main NSWRL competition in 1929.\n\nIn November 1921 in England, the first \u00a31,000 transfer fee took winger [[Harold Buck]] from [[Hunslet R.L.F.C.|Hunslet]] to [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]].\n\nInternationally, the game had settled into a steady pattern of alternating tours, with either Australia or New Zealand visiting Britain once every two years, and Britain reciprocating in the [[southern hemisphere]]. The war had intervened, but the schedule was picked up again after hostilities ceased.\n\nAn increasing number of Australian and New Zealand players headed for the bigger pay packets on offer in England, many of them destined never to be seen again on the playing fields of their home countries.\n\nIn 1933 a proposed [[hybrid sports|hybrid sport]] of rugby league and [[Australian rules football]] was trialled only once.\n\n=== 1930s and early 1940s ===\n{{see also|Rugby league in France|Rugby league in Australia#History}}\n\nFor many years, the rugby union authorities had suspected that the French rugby union was abusing the idea of amateurism, and in the early 1930s the French Rugby Union was suspended from playing against the other nations.\nIn 1932 the first rugby league match under floodlights is played between Leeds and Wigan at White City in London.<ref name=\"The History Of Rugby League\">{{cite web|title=The History of Rugby League|url=http://www.napit.co.uk/viewus/infobank/rugby/superleague/history.php|work=Rugby League Information|publisher=napit.co.uk|accessdate=2 January 2014}}</ref>\nFollowing development work by both [[Harry Sunderland]] (on behalf of the [[Australian Rugby League]]) and the [[Rugby Football League]] based in England, the Australian and Great British Test teams played an exhibition game at [[Stade Pershing]] in Paris in late December 1933.\nThe French Rugby League was formed on 6 April 1934.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lyle|first=Beaton|title=75 Years of French Rugby League|url=http://www.rleague.com/content/article.php?id=32875|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120908091158/http://www.rleague.com/content/article.php?id=32875|url-status=dead|archive-date=8 September 2012|accessdate=30 October 2011|newspaper=rleague.com|date=7 April 2009}}</ref>\n\nLooking round for an alternative, many French players turned to rugby league, which soon became the dominant game in France, particularly in the south west of the country. The arrival of a French team on the international scene allowed more variety in the touring pattern, and also for the introduction of a [[Rugby league European Nations Cup|European Championship]].\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], the British government took a more benign view of professional sports, viewing them as a vital aid to public morale. Although normal leagues were suspended, a War Emergency League was established, with clubs playing separate Yorkshire and Lancashire sections to reduce the need for travel. This period also saw a temporary relaxation of the regulations prohibiting rugby union players from contact with rugby league. In an extraordinary development a team representing rugby league met a rugby union equivalent in two matches, held to raise money for the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]]. Both games were held under rugby union rules; both were won by the rugby league side.\n\nIn Australia, the war years produced large crowds, and financially at least, the sport did not suffer the hardships endured during the First World War. Nonetheless, the loss of many young men in fighting undoubtedly weakened the talent pool available.\n\nThe defeat of France had serious implications for [[rugby league in France]]. The [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime banned rugby league and forced players, clubs and officials to switch codes to union. Assets of the rugby league and its clubs were handed over to union.\n\nThe consequences of this action still reverberate; the assets were never returned, and although the ban on rugby league was lifted, it was prevented from calling itself rugby from 1949 to the mid-1980s, having to use the name '''Jeu \u00e0 Treize''' (''Game of Thirteen'', in reference to the number of players in a rugby league side).\n\n=== Late 1940s and 1950s ===\n\nThe rules of the sport had continued to evolve, and until the 1940s there was no world governing body to oversee this and ensure consistency. Negotiations between the respective governing bodies were required to fix rules to be used for tours, though generally the other nations took their lead from the British authorities. For example, the [[field goal (rugby)|field goal]] was banned by the New South Wales Rugby League in 1922 however this method of scoring was not officially recognised as being removed from the game until 1950 when the British authorities banned it.<ref>http://www.wakefieldtrinity-programmes.co.uk/page_2655812.html</ref>\n\nThis situation endured until 1948, when at the instigation of the French, the [[International Rugby League|Rugby League International Federation]] (RLIF) was formed at a meeting on 25 January 1948 in [[Bordeaux]]. The [[1947\u201348 Northern Rugby Football League season]]'s [[Challenge Cup]] Final was the first rugby league match to be televised.<ref name=\"The History Of Rugby League\"/> All spectator sports in the United Kingdom experienced a surge in interest in the years following the end of [[World War II]] and rugby league boomed.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = Demsteader\n  | first = Christine\n  | title = Rugby League's home from home\n  | work = BBC Sport\n  | place =UK\n  | pages = \n  | publisher = BBC\n  | date = 1 October 2000\n  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/in_depth/2000/wembley/944481.stm\n  | accessdate = 4 December 2009}}</ref> Large crowds came to be expected as the norm for a period of around 20 years.

The officially recorded attendance was at 102,569(a record for a single match of rugby league that stood until 107,999 watched [[Melbourne Storm]] defeat [[St George Illawarra Dragons]] at [[Stadium Australia]] in [[National Rugby League season 1999|1999]]). It is estimated that a further 20,000 spectators were present, as many got in free after a section of fencing collapsed. Warrington beat Halifax 8\u20134.\n\nThis period also saw growth in crowds in Australia, New Zealand and France. This was a golden age for the French, who led by the incomparable [[Puig Aubert]], travelled to Australia and defeated their host in a three test series in 1951. On their return to France the victorious team were greeted by an estimated 100,000 fans in [[Marseille]]. They repeated the feat in France 1952\u201353 and again in Australia in 1955.\n\nThe French were the driving force behind the staging of the first [[1954 Rugby League World Cup|Rugby League World Cup]] (also the first tournament to be officially known as the \"Rugby World Cup\") in 1954. This competition has been held intermittently since then, in a variety of formats. Unlike many other sports the World Cup has never really been the pinnacle of the international game, that honour falling to international test series such as the [[The Ashes (rugby league)|Ashes]].\n\nIn 1956, the [[state government]] of [[New South Wales]] legalised the playing of [[poker machine]]s (\"pokies\") in profit clubs, and this rapidly became the major source of income for NSW \"[[leagues clubs]]\", some of which became palatial \"homes away from home\" for their supporters. The pokie windfall stemmed the steady trickle of Australian players to the better-financed clubs in England, and led to increased recruiting of rugby union and league players from [[Queensland]] and overseas by New South Welsh clubs. Within the space of several years, the Sydney-based league had come to dominate the code within Australia. The large profits accrued from gambling have always been controversial; many questioned the morality of such an income stream and felt that it would inevitably lead to financial turmoil and scandal.\n\n=== 1960s and 1970s ===\n1961 saw the first televised game of rugby league in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|last=[[Sean Fagan]]|title=nrl.com|url=http://www.nrl.com/nrlhq/referencecentre/historyofrugbyleague/tabid/10440/default.aspx|work=History of Rugby League|publisher=[[NRL]]|accessdate=2 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623221835/http://www.nrl.com/nrlhq/referencecentre/historyofrugbyleague/tabid/10440/default.aspx|archive-date=23 June 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the UK live coverage of professional rugby league began in the early 1960s, exposing the game to a national audience.<ref>{{cite book|last=Eric Dunning, Kenneth Sheard|title=Barbarians, Gentlemen And Players: A Sociological Study Of The Development Of Rugby Football|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=UK|isbn= 9780714682907|page=194|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1V7IT4O1tmgC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> [[David Attenborough]], then controller of [[BBC2]], made the decision to screen rugby league games from a new competition specially designed for evening televising, the ''BBC2 Television Floodlit Trophy''. Although it was widely seen as a [[gimmick]], it proved a success, and rugby league has featured on television ever since, to the point where (like most sports) income from selling broadcasting rights is the single greatest source of revenue for the game. In Australia the [[1967 NSWRFL season]]'s [[grand final]] became the first football grand final of any code to be televised live in Australia. The [[Nine Network]] had paid $5,000 for the broadcasting rights.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last = Masters\n  | first = Roy\n  | authorlink = Roy Masters (sport) \n  | title = Messenger can watch a better league broadcast in the US than south of the border\n  | work = [[Brisbane Times]]\n  | publisher = Fairfax Digital  \n  | date = 4 October 2009\n  | url = http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/business/messenger-can-watch-a-better-league-broadcast-in-the-us-than-south-of-the-border-20091004-ghve.html\n  | doi = \n  | accessdate = 4 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nThis period also saw further alterations to the rules of the sport. In 1964 substitutes were allowed for the first time, but only for players injured before half-time. In 1966 limited tackles were introduced. In 1967 professional matches were first allowed on Sundays. Also this year the number of times a team could retain possession after a [[Rugby league#play-the-ball|play-the-ball]] was limited to four tackles.<ref name=WIP>{{cite book\n |last=Middleton \n |first=David \n |title=League of Legends: 100 Years of Rugby League in Australia \n |publisher=National Museum of Australia \n |year=2008 \n |page=27 \n |url=http://www.nma.gov.au/shared/libraries/attachments/league_of_legends/rugby_league_a_work_in_progress/files/22453/F_RL_work_in_progress.pdf \n |isbn=978-1-876944-64-3 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317093000/http://www.nma.gov.au/shared/libraries/attachments/league_of_legends/rugby_league_a_work_in_progress/files/22453/F_RL_work_in_progress.pdf \n |archivedate=17 March 2011 \n |df=dmy-all \n}}</ref> The concept of limited tackles had existed in [[American football]] since the 1880s, and it was hoped that this would encourage more attacking play, and prevent teams from simply playing to maintain possession of the ball at all costs. Although successful in this respect, it was felt that four tackles did not give sufficient time to develop an attack, with play often being characterised by pure panic. In 1971, the number of tackles allowed was increased to six, and has remained so ever since. That year the value of field goals was reduced as well, from 2 to 1.<ref name= WIP/>\n\nIn Britain's 1971\u201372 season, sponsors first entered the game: brewers [[Joshua Tetley]] and cigarette brand [[John Player]]. In 1976 Sydney club Eastern Suburbs set a precedent with a major sponsor, City Ford appearing on their jersey.\n\nIn 1977 Australian forward [[Graham Olling]] made headlines when he became the first rugby league player to admit to taking [[anabolic steroids]], which at the time were not illegal in the sport.<ref>{{cite news|last=Curtin|first=Jennie|title=Simply the Best|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&docID=news980713_0529_7766|accessdate=2 January 2012|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=11 July 1998}}</ref>\n\n===1980s and early 1990s===\n\nIn 1980 the [[1980 State of Origin game|first State of Origin match]] was played in Australia. This pitted teams representative of [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]] against each other. Although matches between the two had taken place for many years, the ''origin'' concept (borrowed from [[Australian rules football]]) meant that for the first time players were selected based on where they first played the game, rather than where they were currently playing. This had an immediate effect, evening up the competition, which had come to be dominated by New South Wales because of the financial strength of the Sydney clubs, and rousing greater pride in spectators as their players were considered more truly representative of their respective states. State of Origin matches are now some of the biggest and most keenly fought contests in Australian sport.\n\nThe 1980s also saw attempts to improve rugby league's popularity outside its traditional geographical boundaries. In Great Britain a new team from London ([[London Broncos#2006\u20132011: Harlequins Rugby League|Fulham]]) was admitted to the professional ranks. In Australia, the first sides from outside the Sydney metropolitan area entered the top-flight competition in. In [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1982|1982]] the [[Illawarra Steelers]] (based in [[Wollongong]]) and the [[Canberra Raiders]] (based in the national capital, [[Canberra]]) entered the competition. As a result of a lucrative illegal [[betting]] market having developed since the [[Second World War]], [[FootyTAB]] was founded in 1983 to develop legal betting on rugby league, and was a resounding success.\n\nIn 1981 the '[[Sin Bin]]' rule was introduced in rugby league in Australia. [[Newtown Jets|Newtown]] hooker Barry Jensen became the first player sent there.\nIn 1983 the number of points awarded for scoring a try increased from three to four. Also in 1983, the Australian [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC-TV]] [[current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] programme ''[[Four Corners (Australian TV program)|Four Corners]]'', aired an episode entitled \"The Big League\". The programme was to have repercussions throughout Australian sport, and in the wider community. Reporter [[Chris Masters (writer)|Chris Masters]] (the brother of league identity [[Roy Masters (sport)|Roy Masters]]) described allegations of corruption within the NSWRL, including suggestions that officials were siphoning funds from particular clubs and international matches while players and spectators endured sub-standard facilities. As a result of the programme, a [[Royal Commission]] (the ''Street Royal Commission'') was called. It led to the New South Wales chief magistrate [[Murray Farquhar]] being jailed, the end of NSWRL president [[Kevin Humphreys (rugby league)|Kevin Humphreys]]' career and the ABC being sued for libel by NSW State [[Premiers of the Australian states|Premier]], [[Neville Wran]] (who eventually settled out of court). Masters, ''Four Corners'' and the commission are widely credited with widespread improvements in the administration of rugby league in Australia.\n\nIn the late 1980s, rugby league competitions were launched or continued to expand in Russia, [[Papua New Guinea]] and the Pacific islands.\n\nA further expansion to the NSWRL in [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1988|1988]] saw the first Queensland teams added to the league: [[Brisbane Broncos]] and [[Gold Coast Chargers|Gold Coast Giants]], as well as another team from outside Sydney, [[Newcastle Knights]]. Expansion occurred again in 1995, with the addition to the League of teams from Perth, Townsville and Auckland.\n{{quote|\"Thirteen-man rugby league has shown itself to be a faster, more open game of better athletes than the other code.

This event affected the sport across the world during the middle of decade, and the damage done is only now being undone.\n\n== Super League ==\n[[File:Suncorp Stadium.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Modern rugby league: [[Brisbane Broncos]] take on [[Canterbury Bulldogs]] in the [[NRL]].]]\nWhile the [[Super League war]] was being fought in Australia, [[Rupert Murdoch]] approached the English clubs with a view to forming a [[Super League]], primarily as a way to gain the upper hand during his battle with [[Kerry Packer]] for broadcasting rights for the sport in Australia. A large sum of money from [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]]'s UK subsidiary, [[BSkyB]], helped fund the proposal. The new competition got under way in 1996. As part of the deal, rugby league switched from a winter to a summer season. The British, Australian and New Zealand seasons are now played concurrently from March to October, and major international tournaments are now largely played in November. The French, however, have continued to play a winter season.\n\nAfter the 1997 season in Australia the [[Super League war]] came to an end, with [[News International]] and the [[Australian Rugby League]] agreeing to merge their competitions to create the [[National Rugby League]], which commenced in 1998. The first ever team from [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], the [[Melbourne Storm]] entered the competition. Several clubs were either forced to merge (e.g. [[St. George Dragons]] and [[Illawarra Steelers]] became [[St George Illawarra Dragons]]), or folded. The omission of [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]], one of the founding members of the original NSWRL, led to mass protests. Although Souths did not participate in the NRL during 2000 and 2001, a Federal Court decision in July 2001 paved the way for them to return to the league in 2002.\n\nIn 1995, [[rugby union]] went professional, and those who had long derided rugby league as merely a professional version of that game were soon predicting the demise of the sport. The Super League war, the financial problems of the [[2000 Rugby League World Cup]] and the signing of several high-profile rugby league stars by the union game gave ammunition to this claim.\n\n==New millennium==\nWith the professionalism of rugby union, several high-profile league players changed codes, with varying degrees of success. Australian RU administrators appeared to be targeting league internationals when in 2001/02 [[Australia national rugby league team|Kangaroos]] [[Wendell Sailor]], [[Mat Rogers]] and [[Lote Tuqiri]] all switched and soon represented the [[Australia national rugby union team|Wallabies]]. Other high-profile players, such as [[Jason Robinson (rugby player)|Jason Robinson]], [[Iestyn Harris]] and [[Henry Paul]] followed. However press claims at the time that the \"flood-gates\" had opened proved to be more sensational than portentous. By the end of the decade, the flow of league players moving on big-money contracts to union seemed to have stabilised, and in fact in many cases this actually proved to be positive for rugby league, with the money gained from transfer fees being used to fund expansion and additional youth development in Britain and with many of the star crossover players returning to rugby league in Australia.\n\n{{Quotation|The game needs to be aware of it and take steps to ensure that it doesn't become a flood.

The game in France saw a renaissance, largely as a result of the [[Catalans Dragons]] entry into Super League, while large advances were made in other countries such as Wales and New Zealand, who finished the decade as World Champions.\n\nIn Australia in 2009, rugby league's popularity was confirmed as it had the highest official television ratings figures of any sporting event.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = Newstalk ZB\n  | first = \n  | title = League becomes Australia's top sport\n  | work = [[TVNZ]]\n  | place =New Zealand\n  | pages = \n  | publisher = Television New Zealand Limited\n  | date = 21 December 2009\n  | url = http://tvnz.co.nz/rugby-league-news/league-becomes-australia-s-top-sport-3315931\n  | accessdate = 24 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n==2010s==\n\nThe [[2013 Rugby League World Cup]] was held in Europe, with the final played at England's [[Old Trafford]] in front of 74,468, the largest crowd to attend an international fixture.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fletcher|first=Paul|title=Rugby League World Cup 2013: A joy that must not be wasted|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-league/25022239|accessdate=1 December 2013|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=1 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe 2014 [[National Rugby League]] Grand Final was the highest rated television show for the year in Australia.<ref>http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/tv-ratings/my-kitchen-rules-the-block-afl-grand-final-and-nrl-grand-final-dominate-the-top-tv-events-of-2014/news-story/34f43c437fc80787d62a13deabf27f4b</ref>\n\nIn 2015, the league went through a [[2015 Rugby League Structure|structure change]] with promotion and relegation reintroduced between [[Super League]] and the [[Championship]].

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1971, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> Banneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family.

Jefferson appointed Andrew Ellicott to conduct the survey; Ellicott made Banneker his assistant for three months in 1791. Benjamin Rush authored the Department of Peace proposal; the confusion arose among earlier biographers because the proposal appeared in Banneker's 1793 almanac.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20171226172141/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 7.] \"The name of Benjamin Banneker, the Afro-American self-taught mathematician and almanac-maker, occurs again and again in the several published accounts of the survey of Washington City begun in 1791, but with conflicting reports of the role which he played. Writers have implied a wide range of involvement, from the keeper of horses or supervisor of the woodcutters, to the full responsibility of not only the survey of the ten mile square but the design of the city as well. None of these accounts has described the contribution which Banneker actually made.\"<br>(2) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/126 Bedini, 1971, p. 126.] \"Benjamin Banneker's name does not appear on any of the contemporary documents or records relating to the selection, planning, and survey of the City of Washington.  An exhaustive search of the files under Public Buildings and Grounds in the U.S. National Archives and of the several collections in the Library of Congress have proved fruitless.  A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection. Equally untrue are legends that Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it.

Many improvements to the ''Freedom'' class came from the problems experienced by ''Freedom'' (LCS-1) on its first deployment including power outages, corroded equipment, and a faulty air compressor. To prevent water being taken into the anchor windlass room, the anchor winch, hydraulic unit, and mooring capstan were replaced with a single electric chain winch on the main deck, and the existing towing chain was replaced with a lighter chain. Corrosion resistance was also improved by the Impressed Current Cathodic Protection system being modified by adding protections to the water jet inlet tunnel. Starting with LCS-3, the stern transom was lengthened and buoyancy tanks were added to the stern to increase weight service and enhance stability. A significantly less complex gas turbine electric start system will be added on LCS-5 to reduce costs and lower ship weight.<ref name=\"dodbuzz27june14\"/>\n\nStarting with LCS-17, the ''Freedom''-class ships will be equipped with the TRS-4D naval radar.  The TRS-4D is an [[AESA radar]] built by [[Airbus Defense and Space]] that is similar to the one on German {{sclass2-|F125|frigate|1}}s, the difference being the LCS will have a rotating version instead of a fixed panel, the first AESA rotating radar aboard a U.S. Navy ship. It is a three-dimensional, multi-function naval radar combining mechanical and electronic azimuth scanning that delivers increased sensitivity to detect smaller targets with greater accuracy and faster track generation.<ref>[http://www.navyrecognition.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3299 Successful Factory Acceptance for US Navy Freedom class LCS' TRS-4D AESA Radar] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124175219/http://www.navyrecognition.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3299 |date=24 January 2016 }} \u2013 Navyrecognition.com, 2 December 2015</ref>\n\n===Engine maintenance incidents===\n{{As of|2016|11}}, three of four active ''Freedom''-class littoral combat ships have suffered engine maintenance incidents. ''Milwaukee'' broke down in the Atlantic Ocean in December 2015 and had to be towed back to port. Metallic debris was found in the filter system. The cause was traced to a clutch between the gas turbine and diesel engine systems, which failed to disengage as designed while switching from one propulsion system to the other. ''Fort Worth'' suffered a similar breakdown in the Pacific Ocean in January 2016. Improper procedures used aboard ship caused a set of combining gears\u2014hardware used to transfer power to the ship's water propulsion system\u2014to be operated with insufficient oil. And in July 2016, ''Freedom'' suffered a seawater leak into one of its two main diesel propulsion systems and had to return to San Diego for seawater decontamination.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/29/politics/us-navy-littoral-combat-ship-breakdowns/index.html|title=Third breakdown in year for $360M US Navy warships|author=Brad Lendon and Zachary Cohen|website=CNN|access-date=30 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830034333/http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/29/politics/us-navy-littoral-combat-ship-breakdowns/index.html|archive-date=30 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Ships==\nSeven ''Freedom''-class LCS ships have been commissioned, two more ships are being fitted out, four more are under construction and three are on order.\n\n===Ship orders and naming history===\nThe Navy originally ordered two ''Freedom''-class littoral combat ships, the lead ship ''Freedom'' (LCS-1) and {{USS|Fort Worth|LCS-3|3}}, announced in March 2009 by then-[[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Donald C.

With 180 metric tons of space available for mission packages, there is room for added capabilities.  Anti-aircraft warfare was suggested with the installation of a [[Aegis Combat System|SPY-1F air defense radar]] and permanently installed vertical launch systems (VLS). Current 118-meter length versions could house 4 to 32 VLS cells, each holding four [[Evolved Sea Sparrow|RIM-162D Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles]] or one [[RIM-66 Standard|SM-2 missile]]. For surface warfare, the 57mm gun could be replaced with a larger weapon up to the [[5\"/54 caliber Mark 45 gun|Mk 45 5-inch]]; integration of the [[AGM-114 Hellfire|AGM-114L Hellfire missile]] for defense against fast attack craft (FAC) was also factored in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.usni.org/2014/06/10/8077 |title=Lockheed Outlines Post Littoral Combat Ship Pitch |publisher=U.S. Naval Institute |last=LeGrone |first=Sam |date=10 June 2014 |accessdate=14 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222172101/http://news.usni.org/2014/06/10/8077 |archive-date=22 December 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Lockheed's approach was to integrate mission systems into the hull so that the ships could perform anti-submarine, anti-surface, and anti-aircraft duties without needing to swap out mission packages. Weight would be increased from 3,400 tons to 3,600 tons and the hull could be stretched an additional {{convert|7|-|10|m|ft|abbr=on}}. In addition to adding vertical launch tubes and a sonar, the main gun would be integrated with the stronger and more sophisticated radar.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://defensetech.org/2014/09/03/lockheed-offers-navy-new-lcs-variant/ |title=Lockheed Offers Navy New LCS Variant |work=Defensetech.org |last=Osborn |first=Kris |date=3 September 2014 |accessdate=14 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326110930/http://defensetech.org/2014/09/03/lockheed-offers-navy-new-lcs-variant/ |archive-date=26 March 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe Navy's recommendation to base the Small Surface Combatant on upgraded versions of both ''Freedom'' and ''Independence'' LCSs was accepted in December 2014. Although Lockheed submitted improvements including vertical launch systems, 76&nbsp;mm guns, and advanced combat systems and sensors, the Navy opted to keep the 57&nbsp;mm gun, not add a vertical launch system, and chose to add an upgraded 3-D radar. Other changes included installation of an unspecified over-the-horizon missile, [[M242 Bushmaster|Mark 38 25 mm guns]], a torpedo countermeasures system, a multifunction towed array system, installation of the [[SeaRAM]] launcher, an upgraded countermeasures decoy system, an upgraded [[electronic warfare]] system, armor added to vital spaces, and improved signature management.  The SSC will focus in SUW and ASW with these additions, as well as retaining all other features of their mission packages; the SSC is not required to perform MCM, which will continue to be handled by the LCS.  The vessels will retain a degree of modularity to concentrate on one mission set and will still have mission bays, although they may be reduced. SSC vessels are planned to begin procurement by 2019, and it is being investigated if the enhancements can be added to existing LCS hulls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defensenews.com/article/20141211/DEFREG02/312110041/Hagel-New-Ship-Based-LCS |archive-url=https://archive.today/20141214154956/http://www.defensenews.com/article/20141211/DEFREG02/312110041/Hagel-New-Ship-Based-LCS |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 December 2014 |title=Split Decision on New US Navy Ship |last=Cavas |first=Christopher P. |work=Defensenews.com |date=11 December 2014 |accessdate=14 March 2015 }}</ref>\n\n=== Multi-Mission Combat Ship variant ===\nIn 2012, Lockheed renamed the Surface Combat Ship (SCS) to match GD's Multi-Mission Combatant term and revealed that the full capabilities, such as Aegis, would only be available on a stretched 3,500 ton hull.<ref>{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Blenkey |title=Lockheed Martin Offers LCS-derived Multi-Mission Combatant |url=https://www.marinelog.com/news/lockheed-martin-offers-lcs-derived-multi-mission-combatant/ |date=10 December 2012 |publisher=Marine Log |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121210054930/http://www.marinelog.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3108%3A2012-10-23-10-15-15&catid=1%3Alatest-news&Itemid=195 |archive-date=10 December 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nLockheed has also been working on a trimmed down version of the ''Freedom''-class LCS to offer on the international market for smaller patrol vessels.<ref>{{cite news |last=Wall |first=Robert |date=26 October 2012 |title=BAE and Thales plot course for smaller warships to fight pirates |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/bae-and-thales-plot-course-for-smaller-warships-to-fight-pirates-8227549.html |work=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=14 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714215352/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/bae-and-thales-plot-course-for-smaller-warships-to-fight-pirates-8227549.html |archive-date=14 July 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> This Multi-Mission Combat Ship adds in phased-array radar and a vertical launch system on a smaller hull with a smaller crew size, at the cost of removing the high speed gas turbines and one third of the mission module area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defensenews.com/article/20130217/DEFREG04/302170014/China-Shipbuilder-Calls-Greater-Cooperation-U-S-Firms |title=China Shipbuilder Calls for Greater Cooperation with U.S. Firms |last=Cavas |first=Christopher P. |work=DefenseNews |date=17 February 2013 |accessdate=14 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nA much larger more capable frigate design was submitted to meet the requirements of the U.S. Navy's proposed [[FFG(X)]] program.

Many improvements to the ''Freedom'' class came from the problems experienced by ''Freedom'' (LCS-1) on its first deployment including power outages, corroded equipment, and a faulty air compressor. To prevent water being taken into the anchor windlass room, the anchor winch, hydraulic unit, and mooring capstan were replaced with a single electric chain winch on the main deck, and the existing towing chain was replaced with a lighter chain. Corrosion resistance was also improved by the Impressed Current Cathodic Protection system being modified by adding protections to the water jet inlet tunnel. Starting with LCS-3, the stern transom was lengthened and buoyancy tanks were added to the stern to increase weight service and enhance stability. A significantly less complex gas turbine electric start system will be added on LCS-5 to reduce costs and lower ship weight.<ref name=\"dodbuzz27june14\"/>\n\nStarting with LCS-17, the ''Freedom''-class ships will be equipped with the TRS-4D naval radar.

The cause was traced to a clutch between the gas turbine and diesel engine systems, which failed to disengage as designed while switching from one propulsion system to the other. ''Fort Worth'' suffered a similar breakdown in the Pacific Ocean in January 2016. Improper procedures used aboard ship caused a set of combining gears\u2014hardware used to transfer power to the ship's water propulsion system\u2014to be operated with insufficient oil.

With 180 metric tons of space available for mission packages, there is room for added capabilities.  Anti-aircraft warfare was suggested with the installation of a [[Aegis Combat System|SPY-1F air defense radar]] and permanently installed vertical launch systems (VLS). Current 118-meter length versions could house 4 to 32 VLS cells, each holding four [[Evolved Sea Sparrow|RIM-162D Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles]] or one [[RIM-66 Standard|SM-2 missile]].

Although Lockheed submitted improvements including vertical launch systems, 76&nbsp;mm guns, and advanced combat systems and sensors, the Navy opted to keep the 57&nbsp;mm gun, not add a vertical launch system, and chose to add an upgraded 3-D radar. Other changes included installation of an unspecified over-the-horizon missile, [[M242 Bushmaster|Mark 38 25 mm guns]], a torpedo countermeasures system, a multifunction towed array system, installation of the [[SeaRAM]] launcher, an upgraded countermeasures decoy system, an upgraded [[electronic warfare]] system, armor added to vital spaces, and improved signature management.

The vessels will retain a degree of modularity to concentrate on one mission set and will still have mission bays, although they may be reduced.

It is located within the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Knoxville]].\n\n==History==\nKnoxville Catholic High School, originally located on East Magnolia Avenue, registered 98 young men and women in 1932. The faculty was composed of four [[Sisters of Mercy]] and two lay teachers. The Reverend Christopher P. Murray was appointed director of Knoxville Catholic High School in 1941.\n\nUnder the direction of Father Murray, additional space was added including a gymnasium-auditorium, dressing rooms, showers, and a science laboratory. In 1947, Knoxville Catholic High School, often referred to by the acronym KCHS, became an accredited member of the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools.\n\nMarch 1951 saw the breaking of ground for another addition. The new building included five classrooms, a library, offices, lavatories, and an addition to the gymnasium. Space was made for a cafeteria and a chapel.\n\nThe extensive campus provided fields for softball, basketball, and other sports. Father Herbert Prescott became the first priest-principal of Knoxville Catholic High School in 1962. Father John Batson was named principal in 1965 and Father Xavier Mankel in 1967. Father Mankel had a long and distinguished career helping to monitor and guide the growth and development of KCHS until 1979.\n\nFather Michael Johnston was appointed as the fourth priest-principal to serve KCHS in 1979. Father Frank Richards followed in 1982. At this time the School Board of KCHS began to organize a major capital Fund Raising Campaign to ensure the future of the private, Catholic school located in Knoxville, Tennessee. Father G. Patrick Garrity arrived as principal in 1985. The school continued to grow in facilities and students.\n\nEnrollment continued to increase over the next several years and with it a growth of faculty. The decision to move KCHS to a new facility was announced in February 1997. After almost seven decades on Magnolia Avenue, Knoxville Catholic High School would be moving to the Cedar Bluff area in West Knoxville. In July 1997, Mr. Philip Dampf became the principal of KCHS and he oversaw the school\u2019s move to West Knoxville.\n\nBy January 2000, the construction of the new facilities was complete.

It is located within the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Knoxville]].\n\n==History==\nKnoxville Catholic High School, originally located on East Magnolia Avenue, registered 98 young men and women in 1932. The faculty was composed of four [[Sisters of Mercy]] and two lay teachers. The Reverend Christopher P. Murray was appointed director of Knoxville Catholic High School in 1941.\n\nUnder the direction of Father Murray, additional space was added including a gymnasium-auditorium, dressing rooms, showers, and a science laboratory. In 1947, Knoxville Catholic High School, often referred to by the acronym KCHS, became an accredited member of the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools.\n\nMarch 1951 saw the breaking of ground for another addition. The new building included five classrooms, a library, offices, lavatories, and an addition to the gymnasium. Space was made for a cafeteria and a chapel.\n\nThe extensive campus provided fields for softball, basketball, and other sports. Father Herbert Prescott became the first priest-principal of Knoxville Catholic High School in 1962. Father John Batson was named principal in 1965 and Father Xavier Mankel in 1967. Father Mankel had a long and distinguished career helping to monitor and guide the growth and development of KCHS until 1979.\n\nFather Michael Johnston was appointed as the fourth priest-principal to serve KCHS in 1979. Father Frank Richards followed in 1982. At this time the School Board of KCHS began to organize a major capital Fund Raising Campaign to ensure the future of the private, Catholic school located in Knoxville, Tennessee. Father G. Patrick Garrity arrived as principal in 1985. The school continued to grow in facilities and students.\n\nEnrollment continued to increase over the next several years and with it a growth of faculty. The decision to move KCHS to a new facility was announced in February 1997. After almost seven decades on Magnolia Avenue, Knoxville Catholic High School would be moving to the Cedar Bluff area in West Knoxville.

Varalakshmi]] in the lead roles. The film was released in the year 1956.\n\n==Plot==\nShekar ([[Sivaji Ganesan]]), the son of Mirazdar Gunaseelan ([[K. Sarangkapani]]), discovers that his cousins Gowri ([[G. Varalakshmi]]) and Sundar ([[M. N. Nambiar]]) are leading a difficult life. Gunaseelan has a daughter who was lost when she was a small girl. Shekar tries to help them against his father's wish and angered by his father's attitude, he leaves home with his cousins. Gunaseelan's accountant Vajram ([[V. K. Ramaswamy (actor)|V. K. Ramasamy]]) and wife Vadamalligai (C. T. Rajakantham) wants to take advantage of this rift and to usurp his employer's wealth. Gunaseelan's loyal servant Poyyamozhi (V. M. Ezhumalai) tries his best to reveal Vajram's intentions, but falls to deaf ears. Greedy Vajram opposes his son Arivumathi (A. Karunanidhi) from wedding Ezhilarasi ([[T. P. Muthulakshmi]]) since she is not from a wealthy family.\n\nShekar marries Gowri, but Sundar leaves home since he feels that he is a burden on them. Sundar meets with an accident and loses his mental balance. He is rescued by Dr. Sumathi ([[M. N. Rajam]]) who happens to be Shekar's lost sister. Meanwhile, Gowri is admitted to Dr. Sumathi's maternity nursing home and Shekar tries stealing in order to pay the bills. Unbeknownst to Shekar, he enters Dr. Sumathi's house and was caught red handed by her. However Dr. Sumathi does not call the police but and advises Shekar and lets him go. Gowri learns about this and leaves the nursing home, humiliated by Shekar's deed.\n\nGowri delivers their first child Selvam, but dies immediately. Shekar found Gowri dead and takes Selvam along with him. Shekar takes refuge with Anthony (P. D. Sambantham), a school teacher who provides him with a job and a house. Sundar lives in Dr. Sumathi's house, but he remains mentally unstable. Meanwhile, Arivumathi steals from his home, marries Ezhilarasi and leaves home.\n\nGunaseelan yearns to meet his son and goes looking for him. Vajram introduces Gunaseelan to a dancer Nalina. Gunaseelan falls for Nalina and shifts to her place along with Vajram, Vadamalligai and Poyyamozhi. Selvam meets with an accident, Poyyamaozhi sees this and bring him back home. Gunaseelan sends for Dr. Sumathi and lets her know to return Selvam to him in the event of not finding Selvam's parents. Sundar meets Selvam and he was able to recall his past. Upon learning the truth, Sundar and Dr. Sumathi sets off to Gunaseelan's place.\n\nMeanwhile, Vajram and Vadamalligai persuades Nalina to imprison Gunaseelan but the plan was spoilt when a robbery takes place and she was attacked by the robber. The robber was Arivumathi who was not aware of the presence of his parents in that place. Nalina confides the truth to the police and dies where Vajram and Vadamalligai are arrested. Shekar was suspected as the robber and gets arrested instead. Poyyamozhi tracks the robber and catches Arivumathi. Ezhilarasi informs the police all Arivumathi's wrongdoings and he confides all his errors and submits.\n\nAnthony reveals that Dr. Sumathi is none other than Gunaseelan's long lost daughter. Gunaseelan and Sekar are delighted with this. Sekar requests Gunaseelan to marry off Sundar to Dr. Sumathi and it was done.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Sivaji Ganesan]] as Shekar\n*[[G.

Muthulakshmi]]) since she is not from a wealthy family.\n\nShekar marries Gowri, but Sundar leaves home since he feels that he is a burden on them. Sundar meets with an accident and loses his mental balance. He is rescued by Dr. Sumathi ([[M. N. Rajam]]) who happens to be Shekar's lost sister. Meanwhile, Gowri is admitted to Dr. Sumathi's maternity nursing home and Shekar tries stealing in order to pay the bills. Unbeknownst to Shekar, he enters Dr. Sumathi's house and was caught red handed by her. However Dr. Sumathi does not call the police but and advises Shekar and lets him go. Gowri learns about this and leaves the nursing home, humiliated by Shekar's deed.\n\nGowri delivers their first child Selvam, but dies immediately. Shekar found Gowri dead and takes Selvam along with him. Shekar takes refuge with Anthony (P. D. Sambantham), a school teacher who provides him with a job and a house. Sundar lives in Dr. Sumathi's house, but he remains mentally unstable. Meanwhile, Arivumathi steals from his home, marries Ezhilarasi and leaves home.\n\nGunaseelan yearns to meet his son and goes looking for him. Vajram introduces Gunaseelan to a dancer Nalina.

There were over 100 Jain families residing there till the year 1950 but over a period of time most of the families migrated to different parts of India. The temple was neglected for a long time, which led it in extremely precarious & pathetic conditions.\n\n==SHRI 1008 MUNISUVRATNATH JAIN MANDIR==\nHasteda along with Paithan and Jahazpur is known for their ancient idols of Lord Munisuvratnath.

Idol at Hasteda is the 2nd oldest Idol of Lord Munisuvratnath.   \n\n==MUNISUVRATNATH==\nAccording to Jain texts, munisuvratanatha was born as 34 lakh plus 25,000 years passed after the birth of the nineteenth tirthankara, Mallinatha. According to Jain beliefs, Munisuvratnatha descended from the heaven called \u0100nata kalpa on the twelfth day of the bright half of the month of \u0100\u015bvina \u2013 \u0101\u015bvina \u015bukla dv\u0101da\u015bi\u2013 to Queen Padm\u0101 and King Sumitra.\n\nIn his previous incarnation, Munisuvrata was born as Surshreshta, the king of Champa, Mahavideh. On the third day of Shraavana (month) Krishna (dark fortnight) according to Hindu calendar, Queen Padmavati of Rajgir saw sixteen auspicious dreams. When she shared her dreams with her husband, King Sumitra of the Harivamsa clan, he explained that a Tirthankara will be born to them soon. Then, Munisuvrata was born to them on the fifteenth day of the Shraavana Shukla (bright fortnight) in 1,184,980 BC.\n\nAccording to Jain texts, after spending 7,500 years as youth (kumarakala), Munisuvratan\u0101tha ruled His kingdom for 15,000 years (r\u0101jyak\u0101la). He then renounced all worldly pursuits and became a monk. According to Jain beliefs, Munisuvratan\u0101tha spent 11 months (chadmasthak\u0101la) performing karma-destroying austerities and then attained the all-embracing knowledge \u2013 Omniscience (kevala j\u00f1\u0101na).\n\n==RESTORATION JOURNEY OF THE HASTEDA JAIN MANDIR ==\nThe ancient tenets of the temple traced its lineage and its significance.

Which clarified that this temple has one of the largest collection of ancient Jain idols located at a single place.\n\nThe progress took a major leap with the involvement of experts in the field of vastu, archaeology and residents of the village. The news of its ancientness soon spread like wild fire among all migrants of the village who had settled elsewhere in the country and began flocking to the temple for Darshan. Migrants were so overwhelmed with the restoration (Jirnodhar) that some people donated their residential building, gold, cash, etc. for this holy cause.\n\n==ABOUT HASTEDA VILLAGE==\n\nHasteda village is situated in Teshil Chomu, District Jaipur and in State of Rajasthan, India.
